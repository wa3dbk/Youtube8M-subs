00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:25.140 
green barrels as standby water over here

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:28.250 
green barrels as standby water over here
behind<00:00:25.949> the<00:00:26.220> wall<00:00:26.460> so<00:00:27.359> I'd<00:00:27.449> fill<00:00:27.720> them<00:00:27.840> up<00:00:28.019> let

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:28.260 
behind the wall so I'd fill them up let

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:30.050 
behind the wall so I'd fill them up let
them<00:00:28.349> dechlorinate<00:00:29.010> and<00:00:29.250> I<00:00:29.369> needed<00:00:29.640> to<00:00:29.820> fill

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:30.060 
them dechlorinate and I needed to fill

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:34.549 
them dechlorinate and I needed to fill
reservoirs<00:00:31.009> but<00:00:32.009> I<00:00:33.079> tired<00:00:34.079> it<00:00:34.140> got<00:00:34.290> tired<00:00:34.500> of

00:00:34.549 --> 00:00:34.559

reservoirs but I tired it got tired of
fill<00:00:34.710> up<00:00:34.739> reservoirs<00:00:35.250> with<00:00:35.460> buckets<00:00:36.270> so<00:00:36.480> I

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.510 
fill up reservoirs with buckets so I

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:39.049 
fill up reservoirs with buckets so I
decided<00:00:36.930> to<00:00:37.020> move<00:00:37.469> it<00:00:37.620> over<00:00:37.920> here<00:00:38.100> and<00:00:38.820> combine

00:00:39.049 --> 00:00:39.059 
decided to move it over here and combine

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:42.319 
decided to move it over here and combine
the<00:00:39.540> systems<00:00:40.489> so<00:00:41.489> right<00:00:41.760> now<00:00:41.940> with<00:00:42.180> three

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:42.329 
the systems so right now with three

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:47.750 
the systems so right now with three
barrels<00:00:43.789> total<00:00:44.789> 165<00:00:45.570> gallons<00:00:46.039> are<00:00:47.039> connected

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.760 
barrels total 165 gallons are connected

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:51.160 
barrels total 165 gallons are connected
here<00:00:48.239> on<00:00:48.450> the<00:00:48.600> bottom<00:00:48.860> with<00:00:49.860> the<00:00:49.890> 3/4<00:00:50.460> inch<00:00:50.550> PVC

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:51.170 
here on the bottom with the 3/4 inch PVC

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:54.260 
here on the bottom with the 3/4 inch PVC
and<00:00:52.170> one<00:00:52.530> thing<00:00:52.710> I<00:00:52.800> did<00:00:52.949> since<00:00:53.399> last<00:00:53.699> year<00:00:54.000> is<00:00:54.180> I

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270 
and one thing I did since last year is I

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:56.389 
and one thing I did since last year is I
put<00:00:54.449> a<00:00:54.480> coupling<00:00:54.899> piece<00:00:55.350> so<00:00:55.620> I<00:00:55.649> can<00:00:55.949> just

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399 
put a coupling piece so I can just

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:58.490 
put a coupling piece so I can just
connect<00:00:56.820> the<00:00:56.969> barrels<00:00:57.329> and<00:00:58.079> do<00:00:58.289> any

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
connect the barrels and do any

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:01.340 
connect the barrels and do any
maintenance<00:00:59.430> on<00:00:59.730> them<00:00:59.910> if<00:01:00.000> I<00:01:00.120> need<00:01:00.300> to<00:01:00.449> see<00:01:01.289> if

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
maintenance on them if I need to see if

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:07.490 
maintenance on them if I need to see if
I<00:01:01.410> get<00:01:01.559> it<00:01:01.649> under<00:01:01.859> view<00:01:02.010> here<00:01:05.360> yep<00:01:06.500> they're

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
I get it under view here yep they're

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:10.160 
I get it under view here yep they're
connected<00:01:07.530> up<00:01:08.430> into<00:01:08.670> the<00:01:08.760> barrels<00:01:09.060> air<00:01:09.240> gooped

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170 
connected up into the barrels air gooped

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:12.890 
connected up into the barrels air gooped
because<00:01:10.560> I<00:01:10.619> had<00:01:10.770> a<00:01:10.799> little<00:01:10.979> bit<00:01:11.070> of<00:01:11.159> leak<00:01:11.900> all

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
because I had a little bit of leak all

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:17.719 
because I had a little bit of leak all
three<00:01:13.290> barrels<00:01:15.259> and<00:01:16.259> then<00:01:16.560> when<00:01:16.770> I<00:01:16.799> to<00:01:17.490> fill

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729 
three barrels and then when I to fill

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:21.410 
three barrels and then when I to fill
them<00:01:17.880> up<00:01:18.030> I<00:01:18.330> put<00:01:19.080> a<00:01:19.110> filter<00:01:19.950> here<00:01:20.340> it<00:01:21.270> will

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
them up I put a filter here it will

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:23.330 
them up I put a filter here it will
filter<00:01:21.659> out<00:01:21.900> a<00:01:21.930> lot<00:01:22.049> of<00:01:22.380> them<00:01:22.530> minerals<00:01:23.130> and

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
filter out a lot of them minerals and

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:26.960 
filter out a lot of them minerals and
crap<00:01:23.850> in<00:01:23.880> our<00:01:24.150> water<00:01:24.420> here<00:01:24.720> we<00:01:25.290> have<00:01:25.820> and<00:01:26.820> now

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
crap in our water here we have and now

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:31.429 
crap in our water here we have and now
goes<00:01:27.659> right<00:01:27.930> up<00:01:28.670> my<00:01:29.670> hard<00:01:30.000> pipe<00:01:30.350> into<00:01:31.350> the

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:31.439 
goes right up my hard pipe into the

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:38.060 
goes right up my hard pipe into the
barrel<00:01:31.710> and<00:01:33.229> then<00:01:36.200> top<00:01:37.200> off<00:01:37.470> system

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:38.070 
barrel and then top off system

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:41.899 
barrel and then top off system
I<00:01:38.100> have<00:01:38.930> flexible<00:01:39.930> tubing<00:01:40.259> which<00:01:40.670> it's<00:01:41.670> one<00:01:41.850> of

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:41.909 
I have flexible tubing which it's one of

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:43.010 
I have flexible tubing which it's one of
the<00:01:41.970> improvements<00:01:42.210> I'm<00:01:42.540> going<00:01:42.689> to<00:01:42.750> do<00:01:42.840> down

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:49.740 
pipe it in I have a cut-off valve here

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:51.319 
pipe it in I have a cut-off valve here
so<00:01:50.009> I<00:01:50.070> can<00:01:50.250> show<00:01:50.549> it<00:01:50.579> off<00:01:50.759> and<00:01:51.000> I'm<00:01:51.060> doing

so I can show it off and I'm doing
maintenance<00:01:51.829> but<00:01:52.829> it<00:01:52.920> gets<00:01:53.040> fit<00:01:53.280> into<00:01:53.659> the

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:54.659 
maintenance but it gets fit into the

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:57.139

system<00:02:17.390> so<00:02:18.260> I'll<00:02:18.560> have<00:02:18.800> over<00:02:19.220> 200<00:02:19.670> gallons<00:02:20.090> for

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:20.810 
system so I'll have over 200 gallons for

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:23.770 
system so I'll have over 200 gallons for
top<00:02:21.020> off<00:02:21.260> and<00:02:22.210> storage<00:02:23.210> and<00:02:23.330> what<00:02:23.420> I<00:02:23.480> do<00:02:23.540> is<00:02:23.720> I

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:23.780 
top off and storage and what I do is I

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:25.120 
top off and storage and what I do is I
just<00:02:23.810> shut<00:02:24.230> off<00:02:24.260> the<00:02:24.410> valve<00:02:24.710> into<00:02:24.980> the

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:25.130 
just shut off the valve into the

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:28.060 
just shut off the valve into the
greenhouse<00:02:25.310> fill<00:02:25.850> it<00:02:26.000> up<00:02:26.120> wait<00:02:27.050> 24<00:02:27.530> hours<00:02:27.890> or

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:28.070 
greenhouse fill it up wait 24 hours or

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:32.770 
greenhouse fill it up wait 24 hours or
so<00:02:28.280> for<00:02:29.270> it<00:02:29.300> to<00:02:29.480> dechlorinate<00:02:30.470> and<00:02:30.740> then<00:02:31.780> there

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:32.780 
so for it to dechlorinate and then there

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:35.590 
so for it to dechlorinate and then there
goes<00:02:32.810> the<00:02:32.990> puppy<00:02:33.430> and<00:02:34.430> then<00:02:34.940> I'll<00:02:35.120> open<00:02:35.510> the

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:35.600 
goes the puppy and then I'll open the

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:38.220 
goes the puppy and then I'll open the
valve<00:02:35.780> back<00:02:35.990> up<00:02:36.230> I<00:02:36.470> also<00:02:36.710> have<00:02:36.980> a<00:02:37.010> spigot<00:02:37.340> here

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:38.230 
valve back up I also have a spigot here

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:42.850 
valve back up I also have a spigot here

couple<00:03:30.870> days<00:03:30.989> they're<00:03:32.269> about<00:03:33.269> our<00:03:33.390> inside<00:03:33.750> in

00:03:34.099 --> 00:03:34.109 
couple days they're about our inside in

couple days they're about our inside in
the<00:03:34.290> CDN<00:03:34.620> tray<00:03:34.829> and<00:03:35.129> here<00:03:35.640> we<00:03:35.819> have<00:03:36.000> it's

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:36.930 
the CDN tray and here we have it's

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:40.399 
the CDN tray and here we have it's
connected<00:03:37.349> to<00:03:37.470> a<00:03:37.500> float<00:03:37.859> valve<00:03:39.170> so<00:03:40.170> when<00:03:40.319> the

00:03:40.399 --> 00:03:40.409 
connected to a float valve so when the

00:03:40.409 --> 00:03:45.020 
connected to a float valve so when the
water<00:03:40.560> level<00:03:40.890> goes<00:03:41.040> down<00:03:42.590> close<00:03:43.590> here<00:03:43.909> drop<00:03:44.909> my

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:45.030 
water level goes down close here drop my

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:49.000 
water level goes down close here drop my
phone<00:03:45.530> go<00:03:46.530> down<00:03:46.769> you<00:03:47.760> can<00:03:47.819> see<00:03:48.180> if<00:03:48.269> they're

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:49.010 
phone go down you can see if they're

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:55.910 
phone go down you can see if they're
released<00:03:50.010> into<00:03:50.340> the<00:03:50.670> system<00:03:51.230> tops<00:03:52.230> it<00:03:52.379> off<00:03:54.920> so

00:03:55.910 --> 00:03:55.920 
released into the system tops it off so

00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:58.330 
released into the system tops it off so
that<00:03:56.069> way<00:03:56.250> I'm<00:03:56.400> not<00:03:56.549> filling<00:03:57.030> up<00:03:57.120> reservoirs

00:03:58.330 --> 00:03:58.340 
that way I'm not filling up reservoirs

00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:00.440 
that way I'm not filling up reservoirs
every<00:03:59.340> day<00:03:59.489> or<00:03:59.790> every<00:03:59.970> other<00:04:00.120> day

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:00.450 
every day or every other day

00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:04.309 
every day or every other day
hopefully<00:04:00.989> with<00:04:01.920> 150<00:04:02.519> gallons<00:04:03.109> I'll<00:04:04.109> only

00:04:04.309 --> 00:04:04.319 
hopefully with 150 gallons I'll only

00:04:04.319 --> 00:04:07.759 
hopefully with 150 gallons I'll only
have<00:04:04.500> to<00:04:04.650> do<00:04:04.769> it<00:04:04.950> once<00:04:05.280> a<00:04:05.430> week<00:04:05.459> I<00:04:06.260> do<00:04:07.260> check<00:04:07.590> the

00:04:07.759 --> 00:04:07.769 
have to do it once a week I do check the

00:04:07.769 --> 00:04:10.220 
have to do it once a week I do check the
reservoirs<00:04:08.189> every<00:04:09.120> day<00:04:09.239> every<00:04:09.569> day<00:04:09.659> for<00:04:09.989> pH

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:10.230 
reservoirs every day every day for pH

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:12.949 
reservoirs every day every day for pH
levels<00:04:10.680> and<00:04:10.920> make<00:04:11.040> sure<00:04:11.220> they're<00:04:11.569> up<00:04:12.569> to<00:04:12.599> snuff

00:04:12.949 --> 00:04:12.959 
levels and make sure they're up to snuff

00:04:12.959 --> 00:04:18.050 
levels and make sure they're up to snuff
PPM's<00:04:13.799> and<00:04:14.069> everything<00:04:16.250> so<00:04:17.250> that's<00:04:17.549> it<00:04:17.849> it<00:04:18.030> was

00:04:18.050 --> 00:04:18.060 
PPM's and everything so that's it it was

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:23.089 
PPM's and everything so that's it it was
pretty<00:04:18.389> simple<00:04:18.780> to<00:04:19.049> build<00:04:21.590> most<00:04:22.590> expensive

00:04:23.089 --> 00:04:23.099 
pretty simple to build most expensive

00:04:23.099 --> 00:04:28.070 
pretty simple to build most expensive
part<00:04:23.310> me<00:04:23.490> and<00:04:23.669> the<00:04:24.020> girls<00:04:25.020> of<00:04:25.289> course<00:04:25.560> I<00:04:26.930> got<00:04:27.930> on

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:28.080 
part me and the girls of course I got on

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:32.450 
part me and the girls of course I got on
there's<00:04:28.289> a<00:04:28.580> drum<00:04:29.580> shop<00:04:30.570> here<00:04:30.900> in<00:04:30.930> town<00:04:31.050> I<00:04:31.620> think

00:04:32.450 --> 00:04:32.460 
there's a drum shop here in town I think

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:38.810 
there's a drum shop here in town I think
I<00:04:32.580> paid<00:04:32.849> 20<00:04:33.750> bucks<00:04:35.270> apiece<00:04:36.270> for<00:04:36.510> them

00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:38.820 

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:42.700 

food-grade<00:04:39.630> barrels<00:04:40.080> so<00:04:40.380> they're<00:04:40.590> clean<00:04:41.010> and

00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:42.710 
food-grade barrels so they're clean and

00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:46.640 
food-grade barrels so they're clean and
I'll<00:04:43.710> probably<00:04:43.980> go<00:04:44.280> on<00:04:44.430> in<00:04:45.210> the<00:04:45.360> next<00:04:45.650> next

00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:46.650 
I'll probably go on in the next next

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:48.890 
I'll probably go on in the next next
couple<00:04:46.860> of<00:04:46.920> weeks<00:04:47.070> or<00:04:47.280> a<00:04:47.310> month<00:04:47.570> to<00:04:48.570> pick<00:04:48.750> up

00:04:48.890 --> 00:04:48.900 
couple of weeks or a month to pick up

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:51.620 
couple of weeks or a month to pick up
another<00:04:49.140> barrel<00:04:49.910> to<00:04:50.910> adhere<00:04:51.330> and<00:04:51.540> I'll

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:51.630 
another barrel to adhere and I'll

00:04:51.630 --> 00:04:53.030 
another barrel to adhere and I'll
probably<00:04:51.840> get<00:04:52.020> a<00:04:52.080> couple<00:04:52.230> barrels<00:04:52.590> because

00:04:53.030 --> 00:04:53.040 
probably get a couple barrels because

00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:56.660 
probably get a couple barrels because
I'm<00:04:53.130> going<00:04:53.280> to<00:04:53.370> start<00:04:53.820> a<00:04:55.130> aquaponic<00:04:56.130> system<00:04:56.460> or

00:04:56.660 --> 00:04:56.670 
I'm going to start a aquaponic system or

00:04:56.670 --> 00:05:02.240 
I'm going to start a aquaponic system or
a<00:04:56.970> wicking<00:04:57.540> system<00:04:58.190> out<00:04:59.190> here<00:05:00.560> so<00:05:01.560> that<00:05:02.190> will

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:02.250 
a wicking system out here so that will

00:05:02.250 --> 00:05:06.320 
a wicking system out here so that will
be<00:05:02.400> the<00:05:02.490> next<00:05:02.610> project<00:05:03.410> within<00:05:04.410> a<00:05:05.090> wicking<00:05:06.090> bed

00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:06.330 
be the next project within a wicking bed

00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:10.820 
be the next project within a wicking bed
here<00:05:06.840> and<00:05:06.870> a<00:05:07.530> wicking<00:05:08.370> bed<00:05:08.580> in<00:05:08.730> the<00:05:08.820> back<00:05:09.830> to

00:05:10.820 --> 00:05:10.830 
here and a wicking bed in the back to

00:05:10.830 --> 00:05:12.410 
here and a wicking bed in the back to
grow<00:05:11.040> some<00:05:11.310> soil<00:05:11.760> plants<00:05:12.150> and<00:05:12.330> then

00:05:12.410 --> 00:05:12.420 
grow some soil plants and then

00:05:12.420 --> 00:05:14.350 
grow some soil plants and then
eventually<00:05:12.720> I<00:05:12.960> want<00:05:13.140> to<00:05:13.260> put<00:05:13.410> a<00:05:13.440> pond<00:05:13.740> in<00:05:14.070> and

00:05:14.350 --> 00:05:14.360 
eventually I want to put a pond in and

00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:19.010 
eventually I want to put a pond in and
turn<00:05:15.360> into<00:05:15.570> an<00:05:15.900> aquaponics<00:05:16.530> system<00:05:17.450> so<00:05:18.450> that's

00:05:19.010 --> 00:05:19.020 
turn into an aquaponics system so that's

00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:24.490 
turn into an aquaponics system so that's
it<00:05:19.200> for<00:05:19.380> today<00:05:19.850> of<00:05:20.850> our<00:05:21.650> top<00:05:22.650> off<00:05:22.890> reservoirs

00:05:24.490 --> 00:05:24.500 
it for today of our top off reservoirs

00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:28.130 
it for today of our top off reservoirs
and<00:05:25.500> standby<00:05:25.920> water
