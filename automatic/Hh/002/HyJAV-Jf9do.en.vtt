00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:20.449 
a little snail sticking out the side of
the<00:02:18.720> cliff<00:02:18.840> just<00:02:19.080> like<00:02:19.410> exactly<00:02:20.010> like<00:02:20.250> this

00:02:20.449 --> 00:02:20.459 
the cliff just like exactly like this

00:02:20.459 --> 00:02:22.880 
the cliff just like exactly like this
and<00:02:20.790> he<00:02:21.269> removed<00:02:21.420> more<00:02:21.690> rock<00:02:21.870> and<00:02:22.140> more<00:02:22.709> rock

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:22.890 
and he removed more rock and more rock

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:25.370 
and he removed more rock and more rock
and<00:02:23.040> more<00:02:23.610> rock<00:02:23.730> and<00:02:23.970> it<00:02:24.030> became<00:02:24.329> clear<00:02:24.569> this

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:25.380 
and more rock and it became clear this

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:27.740 
and more rock and it became clear this
was<00:02:25.590> a<00:02:25.620> snout<00:02:25.920> of<00:02:26.489> a<00:02:26.670> flat<00:02:26.940> headed<00:02:27.180> animal<00:02:27.599> and

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:27.750 
was a snout of a flat headed animal and

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:29.839 
was a snout of a flat headed animal and
that's<00:02:27.989> when<00:02:28.200> we<00:02:28.290> knew<00:02:28.319> flat<00:02:29.220> headed<00:02:29.400> animal

00:02:29.839 --> 00:02:29.849 
that's when we knew flat headed animal

00:02:29.849 --> 00:02:32.420 
that's when we knew flat headed animal
of<00:02:29.970> 375<00:02:30.780> million<00:02:31.200> years<00:02:31.410> old<00:02:31.620> this<00:02:32.190> is<00:02:32.310> going

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:32.430 
of 375 million years old this is going

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:34.940 
of 375 million years old this is going
to<00:02:32.489> be<00:02:32.549> something<00:02:32.819> interesting<00:02:33.620> they<00:02:34.620> called

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:34.950 
to be something interesting they called

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:37.580 
to be something interesting they called
it<00:02:35.190> Tiktaalik<00:02:36.030> which<00:02:36.720> means<00:02:37.019> large

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:37.590 
it Tiktaalik which means large

discovered showing how land animals

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:50.750 
discovered showing how land animals
evolved<00:02:47.730> from<00:02:47.910> primitive<00:02:48.209> fish<00:02:49.730> over<00:02:50.730> here

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:50.760 
evolved from primitive fish over here

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:53.059 
evolved from primitive fish over here
you<00:02:50.970> have<00:02:51.090> a<00:02:51.120> fish<00:02:51.629> of<00:02:51.780> about<00:02:51.989> 380<00:02:52.769> million

00:02:53.059 --> 00:02:53.069 
you have a fish of about 380 million

00:02:53.069 --> 00:02:53.660 
you have a fish of about 380 million
years<00:02:53.310> old

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:53.670 
years old

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:55.490 
years old
I<00:02:53.790> mean<00:02:54.329> it's<00:02:54.540> like<00:02:54.630> any<00:02:54.780> good<00:02:54.900> fish<00:02:55.170> it<00:02:55.350> has

00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:55.500 
I mean it's like any good fish it has

00:02:55.500 --> 00:03:00.289 
I mean it's like any good fish it has
scales<00:02:55.920> on<00:02:56.130> its<00:02:56.250> back<00:02:56.459> and<00:02:56.700> fins<00:02:57.480> you<00:02:59.299> compare

00:03:00.289 --> 00:03:00.299 
scales on its back and fins you compare

00:03:00.299 --> 00:03:02.420 
scales on its back and fins you compare
that<00:03:00.329> to<00:03:00.510> an<00:03:00.989> amphibian<00:03:01.709> you<00:03:01.889> find<00:03:02.160> a<00:03:02.250> creature

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:02.430 
that to an amphibian you find a creature

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:04.849 
that to an amphibian you find a creature
that<00:03:02.790> doesn't<00:03:03.269> have<00:03:03.450> scales<00:03:03.750> and<00:03:04.109> it's

00:03:04.849 --> 00:03:04.859 
that doesn't have scales and it's

00:03:04.859 --> 00:03:08.300 
that doesn't have scales and it's
modified<00:03:05.519> the<00:03:05.850> fins<00:03:06.120> to<00:03:06.630> become<00:03:06.959> limbs<00:03:07.410> arms

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:08.310 
modified the fins to become limbs arms

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:10.099 
modified the fins to become limbs arms
and<00:03:08.459> legs<00:03:08.609> and<00:03:08.880> it<00:03:09.420> heads<00:03:09.540> very<00:03:09.630> different<00:03:09.989> it

00:03:10.099 --> 00:03:10.109 
and legs and it heads very different it

00:03:10.109 --> 00:03:13.039 
and legs and it heads very different it
has<00:03:10.260> a<00:03:10.319> flat<00:03:10.650> head<00:03:10.950> with<00:03:11.250> eyes<00:03:11.519> on<00:03:11.549> top<00:03:12.030> and<00:03:12.299> a

00:03:13.039 --> 00:03:13.049 
has a flat head with eyes on top and a

00:03:13.049 --> 00:03:15.530 
has a flat head with eyes on top and a
neck<00:03:13.730> what<00:03:14.730> we<00:03:14.819> see<00:03:15.030> when<00:03:15.180> we<00:03:15.239> look<00:03:15.389> at<00:03:15.450> the

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:15.540 
neck what we see when we look at the

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:17.750 
neck what we see when we look at the
fossil<00:03:15.720> record<00:03:16.260> at<00:03:16.380> rocks<00:03:16.739> of<00:03:16.920> just<00:03:17.340> the<00:03:17.549> right

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:17.760 
fossil record at rocks of just the right

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:20.330 
fossil record at rocks of just the right
age<00:03:18.060> there's<00:03:18.900> a<00:03:19.019> creature<00:03:19.260> like<00:03:19.530> Tiktaalik

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:20.340 
age there's a creature like Tiktaalik

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:22.520 
age there's a creature like Tiktaalik
just<00:03:20.790> like<00:03:20.910> a<00:03:20.940> fish<00:03:21.239> it<00:03:21.690> has<00:03:21.720> scales<00:03:22.139> on<00:03:22.410> its

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:22.530 
just like a fish it has scales on its

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:24.830 
just like a fish it has scales on its
back<00:03:22.769> and<00:03:23.099> fins<00:03:24.000> you<00:03:24.150> can<00:03:24.359> see<00:03:24.540> the<00:03:24.660> fin

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:24.840 
back and fins you can see the fin

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:27.110 
back and fins you can see the fin
webbing<00:03:25.170> here<00:03:25.430> giving<00:03:26.430> me<00:03:26.549> look<00:03:26.790> at<00:03:26.849> the<00:03:26.910> head

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:27.120 
webbing here giving me look at the head

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:28.670 
webbing here giving me look at the head
you<00:03:27.599> see<00:03:27.750> something<00:03:28.019> very<00:03:28.170> different<00:03:28.319> you<00:03:28.530> see

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:28.680 
you see something very different you see

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:30.229 
you see something very different you see
a<00:03:28.709> very<00:03:28.859> in<00:03:28.980> phibian<00:03:29.340> like<00:03:29.489> thing<00:03:29.700> with<00:03:29.819> a<00:03:29.849> flat

00:03:30.229 --> 00:03:30.239 
a very in phibian like thing with a flat

00:03:30.239 --> 00:03:32.720 
a very in phibian like thing with a flat
head<00:03:30.269> with<00:03:31.019> eyes<00:03:31.170> on<00:03:31.200> top<00:03:31.680> it<00:03:32.340> gets<00:03:32.519> even

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:32.730 
head with eyes on top it gets even

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:34.970 
head with eyes on top it gets even
better<00:03:32.880> when<00:03:33.150> we<00:03:33.239> take<00:03:33.419> the<00:03:33.540> fin<00:03:33.720> apart<00:03:34.079> and<00:03:34.859> we

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:34.980 
better when we take the fin apart and we

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:37.490 
better when we take the fin apart and we
look<00:03:35.130> inside<00:03:35.280> the<00:03:35.519> fin<00:03:35.880> as<00:03:36.120> in<00:03:36.389> this<00:03:36.510> cast<00:03:37.019> here

00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:37.500 
look inside the fin as in this cast here

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:39.530 
look inside the fin as in this cast here
or<00:03:38.099> you'll<00:03:38.220> see<00:03:38.400> it<00:03:38.489> as<00:03:38.579> bones<00:03:38.819> that<00:03:39.150> compared

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:39.540 
or you'll see it as bones that compared

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:42.470 
or you'll see it as bones that compared
to<00:03:39.569> our<00:03:39.959> shoulder<00:03:40.709> elbow<00:03:41.370> even<00:03:41.940> parts<00:03:42.239> of<00:03:42.389> the

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:42.480 
to our shoulder elbow even parts of the

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:45.349 
to our shoulder elbow even parts of the
wrist<00:03:42.660> bone<00:03:43.290> for<00:03:43.650> bone<00:03:43.799> so<00:03:44.760> you<00:03:44.849> have<00:03:44.940> a<00:03:45.000> fish

00:03:45.349 --> 00:03:45.359 
wrist bone for bone so you have a fish

00:03:45.359 --> 00:03:47.960 
wrist bone for bone so you have a fish
at<00:03:46.230> just<00:03:46.500> the<00:03:46.650> right<00:03:46.799> time<00:03:47.130> in<00:03:47.400> the<00:03:47.519> history<00:03:47.849> of
