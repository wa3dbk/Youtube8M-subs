I could just watch it and I probably get

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:15.320

better<00:01:12.750> quality<00:01:13.020> you<00:01:13.439> know<00:01:13.830> sitting<00:01:14.189> in<00:01:15.090> my

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
better quality you know sitting in my

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:16.910 
better quality you know sitting in my
living<00:01:15.509> room<00:01:15.600> and<00:01:15.960> it<00:01:16.110> would<00:01:16.229> be<00:01:16.470> you<00:01:16.799> know<00:01:16.890> a

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
living room and it would be you know a

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:19.999 
living room and it would be you know a
lot<00:01:17.189> easier<00:01:17.600> but<00:01:18.600> as<00:01:18.869> you<00:01:18.960> can<00:01:19.049> see<00:01:19.110> there<00:01:19.409> so

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
lot easier but as you can see there so

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:22.100 
lot easier but as you can see there so
the<00:01:20.310> Lucas<00:01:20.580> Oil<00:01:20.640> Stadium<00:01:20.790> is<00:01:21.119> huge<00:01:21.509> there's

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
the Lucas Oil Stadium is huge there's

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:24.590 
the Lucas Oil Stadium is huge there's
actually<00:01:22.549> 42,000<00:01:23.549> people<00:01:23.700> there<00:01:24.030> which<00:01:24.479> is

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
actually 42,000 people there which is

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:26.630 
actually 42,000 people there which is
awesome<00:01:24.990> and<00:01:25.110> I<00:01:25.229> don't<00:01:25.500> think<00:01:25.710> it<00:01:25.830> was<00:01:25.920> full<00:01:26.189> it

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 
awesome and I don't think it was full it

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:28.130 
awesome and I don't think it was full it
was<00:01:26.729> probably<00:01:26.970> like<00:01:27.119> half<00:01:27.270> capacity<00:01:27.540> I<00:01:27.960> would

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
was probably like half capacity I would

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:30.289 
was probably like half capacity I would
guess<00:01:28.350> but<00:01:28.950> we<00:01:29.369> actually<00:01:29.520> ended<00:01:30.030> up<00:01:30.119> getting

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
guess but we actually ended up getting

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:32.359 
guess but we actually ended up getting
tickets<00:01:30.869> in<00:01:31.049> the<00:01:31.320> hundred<00:01:31.770> level<00:01:32.040> so<00:01:32.189> here's

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:32.369 
tickets in the hundred level so here's

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:34.429

watched the replay they were like wow

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:21.590 
watched the replay they were like wow
that<00:03:19.230> was<00:03:19.590> not<00:03:19.799> the<00:03:20.010> best<00:03:20.160> call<00:03:20.430> so<00:03:20.760> Cambiasso

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:21.600 
that was not the best call so Cambiasso

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:23.000 
that was not the best call so Cambiasso
was<00:03:21.750> not<00:03:21.870> too<00:03:22.049> happy<00:03:22.170> about<00:03:22.350> that<00:03:22.650> one

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:23.010 
was not too happy about that one

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:25.160 
was not too happy about that one
I<00:03:23.060> think<00:03:24.060> somebody<00:03:24.360> actually<00:03:24.570> gets<00:03:24.810> a<00:03:24.930> yellow

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:25.170 
I think somebody actually gets a yellow

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:26.690 
I think somebody actually gets a yellow
card<00:03:25.380> here<00:03:25.530> for<00:03:25.560> complaining<00:03:26.130> about<00:03:26.310> the<00:03:26.519> call

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:04.680 
anything like that here but I really

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:06.259 
anything like that here but I really
like<00:04:04.860> what<00:04:04.890> Guiness<00:04:05.489> is<00:04:05.640> doing<00:04:05.880> with<00:04:06.060> this

00:04:06.259 --> 00:04:06.269 
like what Guiness is doing with this

00:04:06.269 --> 00:04:08.630 
like what Guiness is doing with this
international<00:04:06.810> Champions<00:04:07.500> Cup<00:04:07.739> so<00:04:07.950> it<00:04:08.370> was<00:04:08.610> a

00:04:08.630 --> 00:04:08.640 
international Champions Cup so it was a

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:10.430 
international Champions Cup so it was a
lot<00:04:08.880> of<00:04:09.030> fun<00:04:09.180> the<00:04:09.330> atmosphere<00:04:09.750> was<00:04:09.900> great<00:04:10.049> and

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:10.440 
lot of fun the atmosphere was great and

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:12.560 
lot of fun the atmosphere was great and
I'm<00:04:10.950> definitely<00:04:11.220> jealous<00:04:11.610> a<00:04:11.850> few<00:04:12.060> guys<00:04:12.239> over

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:12.570

00:04:12.570 --> 00:04:14.000 
I'm definitely jealous a few guys over
in<00:04:12.840> Europe<00:04:13.140> who<00:04:13.230> get<00:04:13.410> to<00:04:13.500> watch<00:04:13.620> these<00:04:13.799> matches

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:14.010 
in Europe who get to watch these matches

00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:16.430 
in Europe who get to watch these matches
on<00:04:14.700> a<00:04:14.760> week-to-week<00:04:15.090> basis<00:04:15.750> because<00:04:15.930> it<00:04:16.260> is

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:16.440 
on a week-to-week basis because it is

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:18.500 
on a week-to-week basis because it is
amazing<00:04:16.979> and<00:04:17.400> here<00:04:17.850> is<00:04:17.970> his<00:04:18.150> art<00:04:18.359> he's

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:18.510 
amazing and here is his art he's

00:04:18.510 --> 00:04:21.190 
amazing and here is his art he's
actually<00:04:18.630> going<00:04:18.840> to<00:04:18.900> take<00:04:19.079> this<00:04:19.260> penalty<00:04:19.799> and

00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:21.200 
actually going to take this penalty and

00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:23.450 
actually going to take this penalty and
Donovan<00:04:22.200> is<00:04:22.440> actually<00:04:22.680> gonna<00:04:22.830> try<00:04:22.979> to<00:04:23.039> stop<00:04:23.280> it

00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:23.460 
Donovan is actually gonna try to stop it

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:25.880 
Donovan is actually gonna try to stop it
but<00:04:23.610> you<00:04:23.789> guys<00:04:23.910> will<00:04:24.180> see<00:04:24.479> he<00:04:24.990> fails<00:04:25.500> miserably

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:25.890 
but you guys will see he fails miserably

00:04:25.890 --> 00:04:27.620 
but you guys will see he fails miserably
he<00:04:26.310> actually<00:04:26.550> dodged<00:04:26.729> the<00:04:26.940> right

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:27.630 
he actually dodged the right

00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:30.620 
he actually dodged the right
and<00:04:27.770> azar<00:04:28.770> just<00:04:29.040> puts<00:04:29.250> it<00:04:29.370> in<00:04:29.460> no<00:04:30.000> problem<00:04:30.510> I

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:30.630 
and azar just puts it in no problem I

00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:31.850 
and azar just puts it in no problem I
think<00:04:30.930> somebody<00:04:31.200> already<00:04:31.350> got<00:04:31.500> the<00:04:31.680> yellow

00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:31.860 
think somebody already got the yellow

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:34.250 
think somebody already got the yellow
card<00:04:32.160> but<00:04:32.400> the<00:04:32.850> thing<00:04:33.060> that<00:04:33.210> really<00:04:33.720> kind<00:04:34.140> of

00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:34.260 
card but the thing that really kind of

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:35.750 
card but the thing that really kind of
sucked<00:04:34.650> about<00:04:34.770> this<00:04:35.010> game<00:04:35.190> was<00:04:35.400> the<00:04:35.430> fact<00:04:35.640> that

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:35.760
