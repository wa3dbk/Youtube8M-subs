00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:13.530
 then how we know they are not done 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:15.450
 miss nothing 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:17.699
 and a few months after the launch of the new one 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:20.580
 audi a3 here is the announced a3 sportback 

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:22.380
 a long-tailed version dedicated to whom 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:24.680
 wants more space for luggage and for 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:24.680
 passenger 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:29.240
 and so perfect as to seem boring 

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:39.780
 we are of course kidding cars 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:41.850
 perfect we like them all right 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:43.559
 sure that with the audi is becoming 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:46.129
 increasingly difficult to find b 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:46.129
 once again become 

00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:54.260
 sportback borrows the chassis 

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:56.750
 of the 3 but with considerable changes in the 

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:58.430
 step 4 centimeters more broken down 

00:00:56.750 --> 00:01:00.460
 equally between the trunk and the sofa 

00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:00.460
 rear 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:06.670
 from the performance point of view 

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:08.410
 this model has an engine that is by now 

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:12.070
 a workhorse 2 liters 

00:01:08.410 --> 00:01:14.200
 turbodiesel 150 horses 320 newtonmetri 

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:15.210
 of torque and a manual gearbox of six 

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:17.650
 relationships 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:21.510
 but I'm sure if I put myself in 

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:21.510
 commitment I can find something 

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:47.189
 here is the guarantee is one thing 

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:50.610
 especially important these days 

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:54.110
 when you spend 29,700 euros which is the 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:57.119
 base price for this audi a3 sportback 

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:58.979
 the German house offers only 24 months of 

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:00.750
 cover the minimum for written by 

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:02.369
 reads and even the audi sometimes 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:04.770
 they have their problems which generally do not 

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:05.819
 they resolve with a few euros sold out 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:08.069
 the warranty argument 

00:02:05.819 --> 00:02:10.350
 let's see how it was done in the front 

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:12.299
 there is the whole place that also serves for i 

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:13.920
 very high drivers but also on the 

00:02:12.299 --> 00:02:17.790
 rear bench seat there is space in 

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:20.190
 plenty for passengers' legs and 

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:23.030
 the volume for baggage has risen from 300 

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:25.459
 5 liters means 3 normal to 348 

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:28.110
 considering also this double bottom 

00:02:25.459 --> 00:02:30.450
 it's not much for a 4 meter long model 

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:31.769
 and 30 but the competition does not offer much 

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:33.269
 more 

00:02:31.769 --> 00:02:35.340
 now we will guide you to this place 

00:02:33.269 --> 00:02:37.380
 wonderful road between sestriere and 

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:39.799
 French border all uphill and with 

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:39.799
 the curves 

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:56.020
 the behavior is sincere the steering wheel of 

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:58.270
 small diameter allows setting 

00:02:56.020 --> 00:03:00.100
 the curves with precision with less than 3 

00:02:58.270 --> 00:03:02.440
 crown turns you go from one end 

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:04.720
 other wheels go right where li 

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:06.730
 we want to put without if and without but 

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:08.500
 and the brakes we gave even 

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:09.580
 five stars which is not a thing that 

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:11.290
 it happens every day 

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:13.180
 the pedal is nice consistent a 

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:17.700
 ready action and braking distance 

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:17.700
 on dry and below 40 meters 

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:22.450
 but also in the wet with asphalt 

00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:24.160
 imperfect have a safe action 

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:25.810
 immediate 

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:27.880
 about the imperfections of the asphalt 

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:28.540
 immediately to talk about the comfort of 

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:30.100
 travel 

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:31.420
 let's say it right away on this version 

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:33.700
 ambition is not the best 

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:35.800
 and this is the second fault it will be for 

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:37.510
 via the sports suspension will be for the 

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:39.130
 18-inch tires 

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:41.230
 the fact is that on our track i 

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:44.680
 results were unequivocal 

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:46.690
 too stiff especially the front end 

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:48.880
 responds dryly on the holes i 

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:51.250
 highway junctions are a torment 

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:52.930
 there are no reactions on the steering wheel but if 

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:55.360
 the seats are added in perfect style 

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:58.020
 German so the card effect is 

00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:58.020
 guaranteed 

00:03:58.110 --> 00:04:02.520
 It can also be seen as a valuable 

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:04.650
 cornering and flat lightning 

00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:06.900
 without roll in the curve release on 

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:08.670
 behavior is neutral or slightly in 

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:10.860
 oversteer but only if forced 

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:13.140
 In short if you live like a sportsmanship 

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:14.550
 so that's okay if I like it instead 

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:16.590
 a slightly softer car 

00:04:14.550 --> 00:04:23.220
 then forget about the 18 tires 

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:24.870
 inches and the sports trim on the 

00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:26.610
 interior perfection there would be from 

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:27.930
 write a book not to mention the 

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:29.340
 multimedia system 

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:33.330
 look at the size of his 

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:35.400
 manual however we must absolutely give 

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:37.200
 a look at the new online features e 

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:39.150
 why thieves to an audi connect system 

00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:41.280
 first level always connected to 

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:43.080
 internet with connect is possible 

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:45.419
 to know the forecasts in real time 

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:47.400
 of time the latest news traffic 

00:04:45.419 --> 00:04:50.880
 and gas stations closer with 

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:52.620
 relative fuel price though 

00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:54.870
 with the 3 sportback stops at 

00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:57.810
 distributor are rarer than usual i 

00:04:54.870 --> 00:05:00.660
 consumption has better than 17 km 

00:04:57.810 --> 00:05:04.040
 with a liter in the city at 15 on the highway 

00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:04.040
 even here five stars 

00:05:09.529 --> 00:05:13.939
 and our test on is not over 

00:05:11.809 --> 00:05:14.509
 quattroruote street reports many 

00:05:13.939 --> 00:05:16.579
 other 

00:05:14.509 --> 00:05:18.739
 in short, if there is perfection in 

00:05:16.579 --> 00:05:21.019
 This type of cars the Audi A3 the 

00:05:18.739 --> 00:05:24.339
 a real point of is very close 

00:05:21.019 --> 00:05:24.339
 reference for the whole category
