00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:15.900 
I was like we got so many play makers

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:18.860 
I was like we got so many play makers
and<00:02:16.470> I<00:02:16.920> mean<00:02:17.670> that's<00:02:17.760> how<00:02:17.910> it<00:02:18.030> is<00:02:18.180> I<00:02:18.390> mean

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:18.870 
and I mean that's how it is I mean

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:20.120 
and I mean that's how it is I mean
that's<00:02:18.959> just<00:02:19.170> how<00:02:19.260> it<00:02:19.380> is<00:02:19.440> here<00:02:19.650> at<00:02:19.709> Kentucky

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:20.130 
that's just how it is here at Kentucky

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:22.730 
that's just how it is here at Kentucky
so<00:02:20.280> I<00:02:20.520> mean<00:02:20.940> I<00:02:21.000> think<00:02:21.030> it's<00:02:21.330> a<00:02:21.390> true<00:02:21.540> same<00:02:21.780> every

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:22.740 
so I mean I think it's a true same every

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:24.710 
so I mean I think it's a true same every
day<00:02:22.770> I<00:02:22.920> would<00:02:23.070> just<00:02:23.220> communicating<00:02:23.820> on<00:02:23.970> how<00:02:24.570> it

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:24.720 
day I would just communicating on how it

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:26.300 
day I would just communicating on how it
should<00:02:24.870> be<00:02:24.900> a<00:02:24.959> better<00:02:25.170> team<00:02:25.440> I<00:02:25.680> think<00:02:25.920> we're

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:26.310 
should be a better team I think we're

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:29.660 
should be a better team I think we're
doing<00:02:26.459> good<00:02:27.890> how<00:02:28.890> would<00:02:29.040> you<00:02:29.100> describe<00:02:29.280> the

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:29.670 
doing good how would you describe the

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:34.940 
doing good how would you describe the
team<00:02:29.880> if<00:02:30.150> you<00:02:30.270> were<00:02:33.470> we<00:02:34.470> were<00:02:34.560> all<00:02:34.709> about

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:34.950 
team if you were we were all about

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:37.460 
team if you were we were all about
ourselves<00:02:35.100> and<00:02:35.670> about<00:02:35.760> how<00:02:36.750> we<00:02:36.810> play<00:02:37.140> and

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:37.470 
ourselves and about how we play and

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:39.710 
ourselves and about how we play and
we're<00:02:38.459> slowly<00:02:38.670> not<00:02:39.180> thinking<00:02:39.660> about

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:39.720 
we're slowly not thinking about

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:42.040 
we're slowly not thinking about
ourselves<00:02:39.870> and<00:02:40.290> thing<00:02:40.560> about<00:02:40.709> each<00:02:40.860> other<00:02:41.040> and

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:42.050 
ourselves and thing about each other and

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:44.360 
ourselves and thing about each other and
with<00:02:43.050> one<00:02:43.230> do<00:02:43.350> go<00:02:43.500> we<00:02:43.620> all<00:02:43.739> do<00:02:43.860> good<00:02:44.040> and<00:02:44.220> that's

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:44.370 
with one do go we all do good and that's

00:02:45.959 --> 00:02:49.640 
what I think we're going off by now I'm
going<00:02:46.140> to<00:02:46.200> take<00:02:46.320> place<00:02:46.530> religion<00:02:47.720> a<00:02:48.720> lot

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:49.650 
going to take place religion a lot

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:52.160 
going to take place religion a lot
during<00:02:49.860> practice<00:02:50.370> and<00:02:50.610> uh<00:02:50.640> I<00:02:51.209> feel<00:02:52.019> like

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:52.170 
during practice and uh I feel like

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:53.600 
during practice and uh I feel like
they're<00:02:52.830> in<00:02:52.860> practice<00:02:53.250> we<00:02:53.340> just<00:02:53.489> communicate

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:53.610 
they're in practice we just communicate

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:54.979 
they're in practice we just communicate
a<00:02:54.090> lot<00:02:54.269> more<00:02:54.510> and<00:02:54.630> that's<00:02:54.840> what's

00:02:54.979 --> 00:02:54.989 
a lot more and that's what's

00:02:54.989 --> 00:02:57.470 
a lot more and that's what's
transferring<00:02:55.709> over<00:02:55.830> to<00:02:55.950> the<00:02:56.070> games<00:02:56.480> breaking

00:02:57.470 --> 00:02:57.480 
transferring over to the games breaking

00:02:57.480 --> 00:02:59.130 
transferring over to the games breaking
down

00:02:59.130 --> 00:02:59.140 
down

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:04.040 
down
oh<00:03:00.600> we<00:03:01.600> tend<00:03:01.900> to<00:03:01.960> break<00:03:02.110> down<00:03:02.290> when<00:03:02.470> uh<00:03:02.530> when

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:04.050 
oh we tend to break down when uh when

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:07.500 
oh we tend to break down when uh when
the<00:03:05.050> guy<00:03:05.230> doesn't<00:03:05.530> like<00:03:05.790> play<00:03:06.790> defense<00:03:07.180> like

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:07.510

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:10.110 
the guy doesn't like play defense like
face<00:03:08.080> to<00:03:08.110> face<00:03:08.410> or<00:03:08.650> he<00:03:09.190> just<00:03:09.370> backed<00:03:09.730> off<00:03:09.910> him<00:03:10.060> a

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:10.120 
face to face or he just backed off him a

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:11.580 
face to face or he just backed off him a
little<00:03:10.360> bit<00:03:10.480> that's<00:03:10.900> when<00:03:11.080> somebody<00:03:11.319> lose

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:11.590 
little bit that's when somebody lose

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:14.130 
little bit that's when somebody lose
focus<00:03:11.800> and<00:03:12.160> give<00:03:13.120> them<00:03:13.240> over<00:03:13.510> shot<00:03:13.720> or<00:03:13.900> we'll

00:03:57.280 --> 00:03:59.380 

yeah<00:03:58.280> because<00:03:58.460> you<00:03:58.640> can<00:03:58.760> always<00:03:58.880> learn<00:03:59.090> more

what<00:04:02.420> you<00:04:02.510> need<00:04:02.630> to<00:04:02.720> get<00:04:02.840> better<00:04:02.930> at<00:04:03.080> and<00:04:03.380> I

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:03.410 
what you need to get better at and I

00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:05.380 
what you need to get better at and I
think<00:04:03.650> that's<00:04:04.190> what<00:04:04.310> makes<00:04:04.430> the<00:04:04.550> scope<00:04:04.820> we're

00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:05.390 
think that's what makes the scope we're

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:10.060 
think that's what makes the scope we're
gonna<00:04:05.510> get<00:04:05.690> makes<00:04:06.110> us<00:04:06.290> a<00:04:06.620> good<00:04:06.830> player<00:04:09.070> not

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:10.070 
gonna get makes us a good player not

00:04:10.070 --> 00:04:11.620 
gonna get makes us a good player not
really<00:04:10.370> I<00:04:10.520> didn't<00:04:10.820> pay<00:04:10.910> attention<00:04:10.940> to<00:04:11.420> him<00:04:11.540> at

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:11.630 
really I didn't pay attention to him at

00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:13.900 
really I didn't pay attention to him at
all<00:04:11.750> and<00:04:12.020> I<00:04:12.410> think<00:04:13.220> that's<00:04:13.490> what<00:04:13.610> is<00:04:13.730> going<00:04:13.880> to

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:13.910 
all and I think that's what is going to

00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:15.610 
all and I think that's what is going to
make<00:04:13.970> it<00:04:14.180> each<00:04:14.420> player<00:04:14.750> a<00:04:15.080> better<00:04:15.380> player

00:04:15.610 --> 00:04:15.620 
make it each player a better player

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:19.030 
make it each player a better player
