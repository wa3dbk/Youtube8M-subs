00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:22.949 
try because I heard so many good things
about<00:02:20.290> it<00:02:20.830> one<00:02:21.459> of<00:02:21.580> the<00:02:21.670> things<00:02:21.910> I<00:02:22.120> like<00:02:22.330> so<00:02:22.360> far

00:02:22.949 --> 00:02:22.959 
about it one of the things I like so far

00:02:22.959 --> 00:02:25.170 
about it one of the things I like so far
is<00:02:23.230> the<00:02:23.440> fact<00:02:23.680> that<00:02:23.739> it<00:02:23.920> comes<00:02:24.190> with<00:02:24.459> a<00:02:24.700> pump

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:25.180 
is the fact that it comes with a pump

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:27.030 
is the fact that it comes with a pump
now<00:02:25.480> this<00:02:25.720> is<00:02:25.959> huge<00:02:26.500> to<00:02:26.799> me

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:27.040 
now this is huge to me

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:30.890 
now this is huge to me
even<00:02:27.459> though<00:02:27.610> I'm<00:02:27.819> not<00:02:27.989> um<00:02:28.989> a<00:02:29.079> girl<00:02:30.040> who<00:02:30.310> is

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:30.900 
even though I'm not um a girl who is

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:34.020 
even though I'm not um a girl who is
experienced<00:02:31.900> with<00:02:31.930> foundation<00:02:32.799> I<00:02:32.980> I<00:02:33.400> see<00:02:33.819> a

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:34.030 
experienced with foundation I I see a

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:37.080 
experienced with foundation I I see a
lot<00:02:34.269> of<00:02:34.299> high-end<00:02:35.459> foundations<00:02:36.459> that<00:02:36.760> don't

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:37.090 
lot of high-end foundations that don't

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:38.819 
lot of high-end foundations that don't
come<00:02:37.450> with<00:02:37.660> the<00:02:37.810> pump<00:02:38.079> and<00:02:38.260> you<00:02:38.349> can<00:02:38.560> purchase

00:02:38.819 --> 00:02:38.829 
come with the pump and you can purchase

00:02:38.829 --> 00:02:41.369 
come with the pump and you can purchase
it<00:02:39.160> separately<00:02:39.579> for<00:02:40.120> I<00:02:40.420> don't<00:02:40.629> know<00:02:40.840> maybe<00:02:40.900> six

00:02:41.369 --> 00:02:41.379 
it separately for I don't know maybe six

00:02:41.379 --> 00:02:43.050 
it separately for I don't know maybe six
to<00:02:41.590> ten<00:02:41.799> dollars<00:02:41.950> I<00:02:42.340> think<00:02:42.370> that's<00:02:42.790> a<00:02:42.910> little

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:43.060 
to ten dollars I think that's a little

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:47.430 
to ten dollars I think that's a little
absurd<00:02:43.750> absurd<00:02:44.079> or<00:02:45.420> extreme<00:02:46.420> to<00:02:46.780> have<00:02:47.109> to

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:47.440 
absurd absurd or extreme to have to

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:49.650 
absurd absurd or extreme to have to
purchase<00:02:47.890> a<00:02:48.280> pump<00:02:48.609> for<00:02:48.940> a<00:02:49.000> foundation<00:02:49.629> that

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:49.660 
purchase a pump for a foundation that

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:50.520 
purchase a pump for a foundation that
costs<00:02:50.170> you

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:50.530 
costs you

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:52.650 
costs you
I<00:02:50.560> don't<00:02:50.980> know<00:02:51.099> thirty<00:02:51.549> to<00:02:51.849> sixty<00:02:52.090> dollars

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:52.660 
I don't know thirty to sixty dollars

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:54.750 
I don't know thirty to sixty dollars
maybe<00:02:52.900> higher<00:02:53.260> depending<00:02:53.769> on<00:02:54.069> the<00:02:54.220> price<00:02:54.519> I

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:54.760 
maybe higher depending on the price I

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:56.699 
maybe higher depending on the price I
think<00:02:55.299> that's<00:02:55.480> a<00:02:55.599> little<00:02:55.720> extreme<00:02:56.049> and<00:02:56.470> I<00:02:56.530> have

00:02:56.699 --> 00:02:56.709 
think that's a little extreme and I have

00:02:56.709 --> 00:03:00.150 
think that's a little extreme and I have

local belt store which originally was

00:03:13.299 --> 00:03:16.440 
local belt store which originally was
priced<00:03:13.780> at<00:03:13.959> $42<00:03:14.950> but<00:03:15.160> I<00:03:15.190> had<00:03:15.370> a<00:03:15.400> coupon<00:03:15.880> for<00:03:16.150> 20%

just going to take two pumps I'm using a
little<00:04:42.370> bit<00:04:42.490> more<00:04:42.610> than<00:04:43.540> what<00:04:43.840> I<00:04:43.870> actually

00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:44.230 
little bit more than what I actually

00:04:44.230 --> 00:04:47.760
