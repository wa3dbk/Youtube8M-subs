00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.839
 he was beaten by the winners of the last final 

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:09.260
 the grand prix he is the undisputed leader and on 

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:12.150
 today in pair skating 

00:00:09.260 --> 00:00:15.080
 Tatyana Volozhar Maxim Trunk not 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:18.750
 among other things world champions 

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:23.460
 their short and arbitrary of the last 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:27.060
 two programs and so were the famous 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:29.810
 Aram Khachaturian's waltz without drama 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:29.810
 masquerade 

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:45.689
 amazingly gorgeous program 

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:50.040
 the hardest items are not random so 

00:03:45.689 --> 00:03:53.010
 talked a lot about what was 

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:56.340
 Germany at this tournament aber build 

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:58.709
 and anticipated that you would see 

00:03:56.340 --> 00:04:01.590
 really amazing sight in 

00:03:58.709 --> 00:04:03.870
 in general, it happened but most probably 

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:06.510
 the main thing in all this is that despite 

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:09.540
 the fact that here were the hardest to choose and 

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:12.120
 and parallel jumps and support but it 

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:15.000
 there was still a waltz everything was that 

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:17.609
 called to music for pair skating 

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:19.650
 like that to perform a waltz 

00:04:17.609 --> 00:04:23.130
 really waltz 

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:25.349
 this is an incredibly difficult task and they are with 

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:30.240
 they did it just brilliant i didn't 

00:04:25.349 --> 00:04:33.830
 wonder if they surpass theirs now 

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:37.719
 same achievement shown in oberstdorf 

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:42.020
 help was 81 

00:04:37.719 --> 00:04:46.459
 65 one-hundredth of a point at the time new 

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:48.939
 world record short program in 

00:04:46.459 --> 00:04:48.939
 pair skating 

00:04:49.849 --> 00:04:54.220
 but what awaits us now 

00:04:52.790 --> 00:04:57.040
 I think that 

00:04:54.220 --> 00:04:58.320
 will be just great denying 

00:04:57.040 --> 00:05:01.380
 ratings 

00:04:58.320 --> 00:05:05.200
 the whole question is just that 

00:05:01.380 --> 00:05:07.660
 nude whether they are very new world record 

00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:10.600
 I would like this really 

00:05:07.660 --> 00:05:13.540
 just everything was perfectly executed 

00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:17.070
 now we will enjoy replays 

00:05:13.540 --> 00:05:17.070
 so let's watch 

00:05:17.090 --> 00:05:23.360
 level four of this triple 

00:05:21.469 --> 00:05:26.930
 emission 

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:26.930
 perfect 

00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:33.250
 synchronized brush 

00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:33.250
 parallel triple sheepskin coat 

00:05:33.529 --> 00:05:41.949
 emit triple rittberger also absolutely 

00:05:38.659 --> 00:05:41.949
 nothing to complain about 

00:05:45.050 --> 00:05:51.360
 the hardest was support for level 4 

00:05:48.870 --> 00:05:53.639
 but they understand perfectly well that 

00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:55.310
 were made 

00:05:53.639 --> 00:05:57.050
 phenomenal program to us 

00:05:55.310 --> 00:05:59.720
 demonstrated 

00:05:57.050 --> 00:06:01.960
 but cities and I understand everything in 

00:05:59.720 --> 00:06:01.960
 anticipation 

00:06:02.139 --> 00:06:23.629
 some super ratings 80 3.05 

00:06:19.180 --> 00:06:25.610
 incredible is one and a half points better 

00:06:23.629 --> 00:06:26.919
 than the results and which was shown 

00:06:25.610 --> 00:06:29.539
 build number 

00:06:26.919 --> 00:06:32.870
 new world record in short 

00:06:29.539 --> 00:06:39.159
 crazy program just grades for 

00:06:32.870 --> 00:06:39.159
 components there are about 9 higher than
