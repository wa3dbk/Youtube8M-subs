00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:26.149
 new video so here in this 

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:31.090
 video I present you the new pack 

00:00:26.149 --> 00:00:32.629
 8.6 in this low pack a few 

00:00:31.090 --> 00:00:34.190
 changes are present 

00:00:32.629 --> 00:00:38.420
 visually at the level of cars 

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:42.550
 the m3 gtr of my carpanin came back yes 

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:46.670
 and also a change at the level of 

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:49.280
 dastan marching more aston martin re 

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:50.629
 lexus gs300 who were there in one of 

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:53.000
 my old car pack that came back 

00:00:50.629 --> 00:00:54.769
 So here we are at this level 

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.930
 rather come back from the come back of 

00:00:54.769 --> 00:00:58.100
 old versions or been improved well 

00:00:56.930 --> 00:01:02.780
 sure always 

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:04.729
 afterwards at the level of mods irving g 

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:06.610
 I held we'll say to advance a 

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:09.409
 little faster all cars 

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:11.720
 I have them all a little bit wade 

00:01:09.409 --> 00:01:14.150
 made a little more reactive so here at 

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:17.240
 level of people worthy of the alter after 

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:19.670
 on the system a dead is given time 

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:22.069
 like coppi I modified a lot of 

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:23.329
 stuff like that if we copy in the 

00:01:22.069 --> 00:01:23.630
 next versions I'll go 

00:01:23.329 --> 00:01:26.299
 account 

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:29.439
 of course I have to optimize the ogrines 

00:01:26.299 --> 00:01:32.770
 always and optimize the lines and everything 

00:01:29.439 --> 00:01:35.710
 after I made a new system for 

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:38.299
 the indes is I added files 

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:39.649
 always to optimize in the 

00:01:38.299 --> 00:01:41.840
 future versions some files 

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:43.850
 will stay there have others go 

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:45.979
 disappear but for now I can 

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:47.389
 that leave them given that if 

00:01:45.979 --> 00:01:49.670
 someone goes from an old version to 

00:01:47.389 --> 00:01:52.039
 a new one that will allow to patch the 

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:56.329
 two files to improve the 

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:58.429
 performance in fact it's stop the 

00:01:56.329 --> 00:02:01.490
 thing makes me that's it's you 

00:01:58.429 --> 00:02:03.740
 will see way in all cases plus the 

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:06.829
 versions goes over it gets better here 

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:08.390
 so this level is here I go in 

00:02:06.829 --> 00:02:11.300
 enjoy during this presentation for 

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:13.370
 make a small point on my ultimate 

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:17.110
 good it's going forward for now I can that 

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:17.110
 to say that it's still progressing
