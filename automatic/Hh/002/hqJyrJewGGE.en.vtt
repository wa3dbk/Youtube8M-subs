00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:17.850
 hello how about youtube friends this time 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:21.119
 I bring you a video on how to recover 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:23.220
 files deleted many times by 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:25.200
 error we have deleted a file and then 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:27.360
 we realize that we need it from 

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:30.119
 again either because we remove it from the 

00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:32.250
 paper or because we have formatted then 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:34.199
 good on the internet there are lots of 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:36.120
 free software for recovery 

00:00:34.199 --> 00:00:37.770
 of deleted data among the most 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:40.020
 popular as the recuva 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:43.440
 pandora recovery mini tool power data 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:45.390
 recovery etcetera etcetera I bring you 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:47.430
 the one that I use the most and the one that best 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:49.320
 results has given me the data 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:50.879
 recovery professional version as 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:53.729
 I always leave the links in the 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:56.100
 description of the video as an example I will do 

00:00:53.729 --> 00:00:59.570
 a test with a microsd card for 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:59.570
 to see the effectiveness of the program 

00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:07.840
 how can you realize the card 

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:09.930
 microsd contains three images and one 

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:09.930
 video 

00:01:31.159 --> 00:01:36.469
 well what I will do is format the 

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:38.299
 microsd card twice to see 

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:40.579
 how the program works and how 

00:01:38.299 --> 00:01:43.060
 retrieves the data even after the 

00:01:40.579 --> 00:01:43.060
 formatting 

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:49.870
 Y 

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:56.909
 i 

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:28.990
 good as you see the card is 

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:31.390
 totally empty and apparently we have 

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:34.030
 lost the data well here is 

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:36.460
 where the program comes in before 

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:38.500
 to begin it is important to recognize what 

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:40.870
 letter is assigned to the unit that 

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:43.410
 we want to analyze in this case is the 

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:43.410
 letter f 

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:58.650
 Well, this is the program as you see 

00:02:55.830 --> 00:03:00.750
 has a very simple interface in this 

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:03.150
 part gives us three options of 

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:05.040
 recovery one to retrieve data from 

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:07.320
 the other recycle bin for 

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:09.390
 recover data from a partition and in 

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:12.260
 this one to recover data from 

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:12.260
 external units 

00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:18.670
 Well, here we simply choose the 

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:20.950
 unit that we want to analyze in this 

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:23.580
 case was the unit of efe and they give in 

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:23.580
 following 

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:38.879
 and the program will start making its 

00:03:36.599 --> 00:03:42.470
 work this will take depending on the 

00:03:38.879 --> 00:03:42.470
 size of the unit to analyze 

00:03:52.569 --> 00:03:56.799
 once you finish analyzing just 

00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:59.560
 we mark this box and we give in 

00:03:56.799 --> 00:04:02.139
 next now we're just looking for the 

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:06.510
 files that we want to recover in 

00:04:02.139 --> 00:04:06.510
 this case the three images and the video 

00:04:08.460 --> 00:04:13.050
 to view the thumbnails of the 

00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:15.500
 images and you give in this option and then 

00:04:13.050 --> 00:04:15.500
 in this other 

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:35.500
 as you see here we already have three 

00:04:32.919 --> 00:04:38.050
 images and in this other part we have the 

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:41.129
 video well we just choose them and you 

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:41.129
 we give the next 

00:04:56.510 --> 00:05:01.850
 then they just choose the location where 

00:04:59.450 --> 00:05:05.950
 they want the recovery saved in 

00:05:01.850 --> 00:05:05.950
 this case I will leave it on the desk 

00:05:12.190 --> 00:05:19.000
 and we have already recovered the data 

00:05:15.590 --> 00:05:19.000
 that we thought lost 

00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:34.009
 yes 

00:05:39.190 --> 00:05:44.110
 now if what they want is to eliminate 

00:05:41.350 --> 00:05:46.390
 files that are unrecoverable in the 

00:05:44.110 --> 00:05:48.760
 description of the video I leave a link 

00:05:46.390 --> 00:05:51.340
 so that they learn to do a format 

00:05:48.760 --> 00:05:53.710
 low level that has been all friends 

00:05:51.340 --> 00:05:56.980
 I hope you liked the video 

00:05:53.710 --> 00:05:59.290
 forget to give her hand up and visit www 

00:05:56.980 --> 00:06:01.860
 point and legal user dot that here until 

00:05:59.290 --> 00:06:01.860
 the next
