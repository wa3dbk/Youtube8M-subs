00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.569
 hey people and welcome back to one 

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:08.849
 further episode gta4 mod performances yes 

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:11.580
 This Monday means again 

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:13.530
 vehicle but this time is not a vehicle 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:19.109
 but a plane had one 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:24.109
 helicopter and an aha 1 z 

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:27.900
 the a1 a h1 z continues from battlefield 3 

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:29.670
 yes very nicely done the model 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:31.439
 I'm going to do a little this week 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:33.210
 battlefield week that is also coming 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:35.540
 a battlefield weapon i believe it 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:37.739
 But there are no benefits to be had in the future 

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:40.309
 So there, is of course the 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:42.780
 description how come you are here 

00:00:40.309 --> 00:00:43.520
 rockets the sidewinders are the faith 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:47.610
 I 

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:56.039
 Therefore, you can see the skirts screwed here 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:58.379
 tops ng camera is nice to the numbers 

00:00:56.039 --> 00:01:02.219
 I even believe the original texts and 

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:04.430
 everything directly exported once number 

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:07.439
 one 

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:10.260
 the marines alcatraz last move 

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:14.369
 That's exactly what air intakes do, of course 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:18.479
 only then textured again 

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:20.310
 air inlets because here we can go in 

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:23.040
 I think I can not look so good 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:28.710
 but purely look very nicely done in 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:32.630
 there is really good so really 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:36.799
 Great had been a lot of trouble 

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:39.799
 Smooth were not over here now 

00:01:36.799 --> 00:01:39.799
 coming 

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:53.470
 so now at least there's a number okay 

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:57.750
 we can not stand why 

00:01:53.470 --> 00:02:00.580
 always so now comes 

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:03.030
 okay we can on a nice well we 

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:06.130
 are there now flying times simply 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:08.440
 Actually, one is very much for it 

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:10.720
 since that therefore the butt replaced over 

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:11.860
 now the doors are right but that 

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:15.010
 Of course not 

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:19.959
 the a4 that's why I replaced the nba 

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:22.209
 the normal helicopter also has 

00:02:19.959 --> 00:02:26.090
 Gast im handling everything we see with the 

00:02:22.209 --> 00:02:29.140
 Hand it fast too 

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:29.140
 then you can also, of course, 

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:37.110
 if you find yourself 

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:39.150
 Just click a little bit too 

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:41.170
 kids so manhattan 

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:43.270
 if there's a little bit in there 

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:45.900
 house gorges look like he is there 

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:45.900
 so flies 

00:02:46.569 --> 00:02:50.530
 Ultimately, crash tests will become 

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:52.829
 might thereby which follows 

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:52.829
 do 

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:09.940

00:03:13.569 --> 00:03:18.600

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:22.970
 were you helicopter life yes 

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:31.910
 it's hard when you play the namely 

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:34.860
 with mouse and keyboard 

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:38.160

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:41.750
 I can meet then but good 

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:41.750

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:47.060

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:06.190
