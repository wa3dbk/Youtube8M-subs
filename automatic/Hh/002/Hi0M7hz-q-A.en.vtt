00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:21.990 
same boat and there are a lot of

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:24.800 
same boat and there are a lot of
proposed<00:00:22.529> solutions<00:00:23.130> a<00:00:23.430> lot<00:00:23.910> of<00:00:24.240> proposed

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:24.810 
proposed solutions a lot of proposed

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:28.490 
proposed solutions a lot of proposed
causes<00:00:25.500> it's<00:00:25.920> kind<00:00:26.550> of<00:00:26.670> a<00:00:26.730> mess<00:00:26.970> and<00:00:27.300> I<00:00:28.080> would

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:28.500 
causes it's kind of a mess and I would

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:31.550 
causes it's kind of a mess and I would
really<00:00:28.769> hate<00:00:29.039> to<00:00:29.400> think<00:00:29.760> of<00:00:30.410> thousands<00:00:31.410> of

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:31.560 
really hate to think of thousands of

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:33.470 
really hate to think of thousands of
people<00:00:31.949> all<00:00:32.340> trying<00:00:32.880> to<00:00:32.940> solve<00:00:33.210> the<00:00:33.329> same

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:33.480 
people all trying to solve the same

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:36.400 
people all trying to solve the same
problem<00:00:34.020> in<00:00:34.260> thousands<00:00:35.070> of<00:00:35.130> different<00:00:35.280> ways

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:36.410 
problem in thousands of different ways

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:39.610 
problem in thousands of different ways
typically<00:00:37.410> I<00:00:37.440> don't<00:00:38.010> recommend<00:00:38.370> this<00:00:38.850> but

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:39.620 
typically I don't recommend this but

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:42.560 
typically I don't recommend this but
when<00:00:40.620> you<00:00:40.770> download<00:00:41.280> the<00:00:41.430> Dropbox<00:00:41.910> app<00:00:42.149> to

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570 
when you download the Dropbox app to

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:45.290 
when you download the Dropbox app to
your<00:00:42.660> iPhone<00:00:42.719> now<00:00:43.350> it<00:00:43.590> invites<00:00:44.070> you<00:00:44.340> to<00:00:44.370> turn

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300 
your iPhone now it invites you to turn

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:48.529 
your iPhone now it invites you to turn
on<00:00:45.480> camera<00:00:45.930> upload<00:00:46.320> and<00:00:47.030> the<00:00:48.030> reason<00:00:48.270> I<00:00:48.329> don't

00:00:48.529 --> 00:00:48.539 
on camera upload and the reason I don't

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:50.690 
on camera upload and the reason I don't
recommend<00:00:48.809> it<00:00:49.110> usually<00:00:49.440> is<00:00:49.530> that<00:00:49.739> it<00:00:50.010> can

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:50.700 
recommend it usually is that it can

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:52.310 
recommend it usually is that it can
compete<00:00:51.090> with<00:00:51.329> other<00:00:51.570> services<00:00:52.170> of<00:00:52.289> your

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320 
compete with other services of your

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:54.590 
compete with other services of your
phone<00:00:52.620> and<00:00:52.949> it<00:00:53.070> can<00:00:53.250> mess<00:00:53.670> up<00:00:53.699> the<00:00:54.120> way<00:00:54.449> the

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 
phone and it can mess up the way the

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:56.660 
phone and it can mess up the way the
phone<00:00:54.809> synchronizes<00:00:55.620> to<00:00:55.649> iPhoto<00:00:56.100> things<00:00:56.489> like

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
phone synchronizes to iPhoto things like

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:59.029 
phone synchronizes to iPhoto things like
that<00:00:56.910> but<00:00:57.870> if<00:00:58.109> you're<00:00:58.500> already<00:00:58.800> having

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 
that but if you're already having

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:02.630 
that but if you're already having
trouble<00:00:59.340> and<00:01:00.530> you<00:01:01.530> can't<00:01:01.800> get<00:01:02.070> your<00:01:02.129> photos

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640 
trouble and you can't get your photos

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:05.600 
trouble and you can't get your photos
off<00:01:02.879> your<00:01:03.149> phone<00:01:03.359> I<00:01:03.660> think<00:01:04.500> that<00:01:04.680> engaging<00:01:05.250> or

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
off your phone I think that engaging or

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:07.640 
off your phone I think that engaging or
enabling<00:01:06.150> the<00:01:06.420> camera<00:01:06.869> upload<00:01:07.229> feature<00:01:07.380> of

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:07.650 
enabling the camera upload feature of

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:10.070 
enabling the camera upload feature of
Dropbox<00:01:08.100> is<00:01:08.369> a<00:01:08.400> really<00:01:08.909> really<00:01:09.390> good<00:01:09.659> option

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080 
Dropbox is a really really good option

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:12.170 
Dropbox is a really really good option
so<00:01:10.799> let's<00:01:11.220> just<00:01:11.430> quickly<00:01:11.549> go<00:01:11.760> over<00:01:12.060> that

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 
so let's just quickly go over that

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:15.230 
so let's just quickly go over that
together<00:01:12.500> now<00:01:13.500> I'm<00:01:14.040> going<00:01:14.580> to<00:01:14.670> assume<00:01:15.000> for

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
together now I'm going to assume for

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:16.280 
together now I'm going to assume for
this<00:01:15.360> that<00:01:15.600> you've<00:01:15.720> already<00:01:16.049> downloaded

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
this that you've already downloaded

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:19.340 
this that you've already downloaded
Dropbox<00:01:17.100> if<00:01:18.060> you've<00:01:18.299> downloaded<00:01:18.570> Dropbox

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350 
Dropbox if you've downloaded Dropbox

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:46.350 
Dropbox when you're on Wi-Fi or when

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:50.929 
Dropbox when you're on Wi-Fi or when
you're<00:01:46.500> on<00:01:46.740> cellular<00:01:47.340> or<00:01:47.909> both<00:01:49.820> depends<00:01:50.820> on

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:50.939 
you're on cellular or both depends on

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:52.910 
you're on cellular or both depends on
how<00:01:51.149> much<00:01:51.390> you<00:01:51.570> shoot<00:01:51.840> I<00:01:52.079> mean<00:01:52.350> if<00:01:52.470> you<00:01:52.590> shoot<00:01:52.829> a

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920 
how much you shoot I mean if you shoot a

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:54.649 
how much you shoot I mean if you shoot a
lot<00:01:53.040> of<00:01:53.100> videos<00:01:53.220> then<00:01:53.820> you<00:01:53.909> probably<00:01:54.329> don't

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:54.659 
lot of videos then you probably don't

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:56.780 
lot of videos then you probably don't
want<00:01:54.869> to<00:01:54.930> engage<00:01:55.079> Wi-Fi<00:01:55.649> +<00:01:55.950> cellular<00:01:55.979> because

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:56.790 
want to engage Wi-Fi + cellular because

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:58.100 
want to engage Wi-Fi + cellular because
that<00:01:56.969> would<00:01:57.060> just<00:01:57.090> chew<00:01:57.630> through<00:01:57.990> your

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.110 
that would just chew through your

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:00.200 
that would just chew through your
bandwidth<00:01:58.670> so<00:01:59.670> if<00:01:59.759> you<00:01:59.850> shoot<00:02:00.000> a<00:02:00.060> lot<00:02:00.149> of

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:00.210 
bandwidth so if you shoot a lot of

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:02.719 
bandwidth so if you shoot a lot of
videos<00:02:00.329> I'd<00:02:00.960> keep<00:02:01.290> it<00:02:01.409> on<00:02:01.530> Wi-Fi<00:02:01.979> but<00:02:02.490> if<00:02:02.640> you

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:02.729 
videos I'd keep it on Wi-Fi but if you

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:05.090 
videos I'd keep it on Wi-Fi but if you
shoot<00:02:02.909> mostly<00:02:03.329> pictures<00:02:03.780> and<00:02:04.140> not<00:02:04.560> constantly

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:05.100 
shoot mostly pictures and not constantly

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:07.520 
shoot mostly pictures and not constantly
every<00:02:05.460> day<00:02:05.790> dude<00:02:06.360> Wi-Fi<00:02:06.659> plus<00:02:06.869> cell<00:02:07.110> that<00:02:07.380> way

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:07.530 
every day dude Wi-Fi plus cell that way

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:09.050 
every day dude Wi-Fi plus cell that way
you<00:02:07.590> can<00:02:07.799> be<00:02:07.920> confident<00:02:08.429> that<00:02:08.610> as<00:02:08.729> soon<00:02:08.819> as<00:02:09.000> you

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:09.060 
you can be confident that as soon as you
