00:00:09.039 --> 00:00:12.659
 to train now how to close your print block 

00:00:13.809 --> 00:00:19.739
 low jig block on our website and 24 hour point cards with fine stitch 

00:00:20.669 --> 00:00:23.669
 and houses the document in the choir with the chosen measure 

00:00:25.789 --> 00:00:31.039
 in our example we will use the so persistent measure 50 millimeters 

00:00:32.670 --> 00:00:35.830
 crystals within seven real patterns 

00:00:35.830 --> 00:00:40.660
 if you already have part of this article ready in the template for 

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:43.660
 put in ceapi art standards 

00:00:44.830 --> 00:00:47.870
 in the block we can only use the color black 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:54.790
 make sure it is the same size as the document page 

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:05.110
 texts and images must not exceed the margin of safety 

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:12.600
 the final cut of your block will be made on that red margin 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:15.600
 so the background should be the same size as the document 

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:19.220
 being filled with white color 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:25.689
 remember to commit all objects have defined investments 

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:28.590
 all sources in curves 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:32.670
 all colors of infinity contour fills 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:37.430
 and all the effects as they are more customer transparency in 20 meters 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:43.950
 to verify it is enough to right-click from outside the 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:45.570
 document 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:48.460
 properties in the document 

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:52.210
 and on this page you can identify which sales are in your 

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:53.490
