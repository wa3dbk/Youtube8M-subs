depending<00:01:34.729> on<00:01:34.819> what<00:01:35.509> we<00:01:35.659> see<00:01:36.140> now<00:01:36.350> that<00:01:36.590> we've

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:36.770 
depending on what we see now that we've

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:39.160 
depending on what we see now that we've
been<00:01:37.000> recently<00:01:38.000> playing<00:01:38.270> multiplayer<00:01:38.600> and<00:01:39.110> I

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:39.170 
been recently playing multiplayer and I

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:41.740 
been recently playing multiplayer and I
think<00:01:39.640> one<00:01:40.640> of<00:01:40.670> the<00:01:40.819> really<00:01:40.970> fun<00:01:41.270> things<00:01:41.300> is

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:41.750 
think one of the really fun things is

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:44.940 
think one of the really fun things is
the<00:01:42.110> way<00:01:42.259> that<00:01:43.039> you<00:01:43.460> can<00:01:43.580> actually<00:01:43.759> go<00:01:44.119> into<00:01:44.479> a

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:44.950 
the way that you can actually go into a

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:47.440 
the way that you can actually go into a
multiplayer<00:01:45.950> game<00:01:45.979> within<00:01:46.580> hint<00:01:47.090> drop<00:01:47.270> in

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:47.450 
multiplayer game within hint drop in

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:50.590 
multiplayer game within hint drop in
mode<00:01:47.659> I<00:01:47.869> think<00:01:48.350> that's<00:01:49.090> what<00:01:50.090> really<00:01:50.240> makes

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:50.600 
mode I think that's what really makes

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:54.210 
mode I think that's what really makes
something<00:01:51.470> very<00:01:51.920> unique<00:01:51.979> right<00:01:52.399> now<00:01:52.990> for<00:01:53.990> me

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:54.220 
something very unique right now for me

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:57.130 
something very unique right now for me
it<00:01:55.220> isn't<00:01:55.670> there<00:01:56.090> isn't<00:01:56.330> one<00:01:56.450> single<00:01:56.750> feature

00:01:57.130 --> 00:01:57.140 
it isn't there isn't one single feature

00:01:57.140 --> 00:01:59.109 
it isn't there isn't one single feature
but<00:01:57.440> for<00:01:57.920> me<00:01:58.039> what<00:01:58.190> I<00:01:58.220> really<00:01:58.520> liked<00:01:58.729> about<00:01:58.850> the

00:01:59.109 --> 00:01:59.119 
but for me what I really liked about the

00:01:59.119 --> 00:02:00.969 
but for me what I really liked about the
game<00:01:59.270> is<00:01:59.479> is<00:02:00.049> that<00:02:00.320> we<00:02:00.439> have<00:02:00.590> this<00:02:00.740> freedom

00:02:00.969 --> 00:02:00.979 
game is is that we have this freedom

00:02:00.979 --> 00:02:03.399 
game is is that we have this freedom
with<00:02:01.340> the<00:02:01.460> camera<00:02:01.850> and<00:02:02.509> and<00:02:02.899> that<00:02:03.110> we<00:02:03.259> have

00:02:03.399 --> 00:02:03.409 
with the camera and and that we have

00:02:03.409 --> 00:02:06.219 
with the camera and and that we have
this<00:02:03.500> tactical<00:02:03.979> aspect<00:02:04.369> which<00:02:04.490> means<00:02:04.700> that<00:02:05.229> it

00:02:06.219 --> 00:02:06.229 
this tactical aspect which means that it

00:02:06.229 --> 00:02:08.710 
this tactical aspect which means that it
really<00:02:06.560> gives<00:02:06.799> you<00:02:07.070> the<00:02:07.549> possibility<00:02:07.700> to<00:02:08.209> do

00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:08.720 
really gives you the possibility to do

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:10.359 
really gives you the possibility to do
when<00:02:08.869> you<00:02:08.989> move<00:02:09.170> your<00:02:09.320> units<00:02:09.649> are<00:02:09.769> on<00:02:09.890> it

00:02:21.099 --> 00:02:21.109 
stronger opponent which isn't as skilled

00:02:21.109 --> 00:02:23.020 
stronger opponent which isn't as skilled
so<00:02:21.620> it's<00:02:21.709> I<00:02:21.769> think<00:02:22.040> it's<00:02:22.250> the<00:02:22.370> combination<00:02:22.579> of

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:23.030 
so it's I think it's the combination of

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:24.370 
so it's I think it's the combination of
a<00:02:23.120> sort<00:02:23.329> of<00:02:23.359> the<00:02:23.660> free<00:02:23.810> camera<00:02:24.049> and<00:02:24.290> the

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:24.380 
a sort of the free camera and the

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:26.440 
a sort of the free camera and the
technical<00:02:24.799> aspect<00:02:25.190> that<00:02:25.280> that<00:02:25.700> makes<00:02:25.910> me

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:26.450 
technical aspect that that makes me

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:31.020 
technical aspect that that makes me
really<00:02:26.480> like<00:02:26.959> collect<00:02:27.320> the<00:02:27.440> end<00:02:27.590> we're<00:02:28.010> doing

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:31.030 

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:34.780 

we<00:02:32.030> have<00:02:32.239> two<00:02:32.840> campaigns<00:02:33.350> and<00:02:34.040> one<00:02:34.430> tutorial

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:34.790 
we have two campaigns and one tutorial

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:37.180 
we have two campaigns and one tutorial
and<00:02:35.150> each<00:02:35.959> time<00:02:36.200> may<00:02:36.410> have<00:02:36.620> 12<00:02:36.950> mission

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:37.190 
and each time may have 12 mission

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:40.840 
and each time may have 12 mission
sentence<00:02:37.730> and<00:02:38.260> I<00:02:39.260> could<00:02:39.829> take<00:02:40.040> approximately

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:40.850 
sentence and I could take approximately

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:43.210 
sentence and I could take approximately
20<00:02:41.239> to<00:02:41.269> 30<00:02:41.840> hours<00:02:41.930> for<00:02:42.620> normal<00:02:42.859> time<00:02:43.040> to

would probably capture quite a few of
you<00:03:26.070> location<00:03:26.580> before<00:03:26.940> you<00:03:27.030> get<00:03:27.269> to<00:03:27.420> your<00:03:27.510> main

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:34.350 
missions are more like all out the souls

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:36.949

but<00:03:35.190> your<00:03:35.340> during<00:03:36.239> the<00:03:36.300> campaign<00:03:36.480> you<00:03:36.720> will<00:03:36.840> do

00:03:36.949 --> 00:03:36.959 
but your during the campaign you will do

00:03:36.959 --> 00:03:38.420 
but your during the campaign you will do
all<00:03:37.200> sorts<00:03:37.500> of<00:03:37.560> things<00:03:37.620> like<00:03:37.920> defending<00:03:38.340> an

all sorts of things like defending an

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:41.240 
all sorts of things like defending an

escort or even a jail break up in one
mission<00:03:41.550> we<00:03:42.420> should<00:03:42.570> also<00:03:42.750> mention<00:03:42.959> that<00:03:43.140> the

00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:43.470 
mission we should also mention that the

game<00:03:43.650> is<00:03:43.769> very<00:03:43.890> story<00:03:44.250> driven<00:03:44.489> so<00:03:44.850> that<00:03:45.030> each

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:45.450 
game is very story driven so that each

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:47.509 
game is very story driven so that each

00:03:58.069 --> 00:03:58.079 
for why this mission is so important and

00:03:58.079 --> 00:03:59.960 
for why this mission is so important and
