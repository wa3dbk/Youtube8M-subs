mouth<00:01:45.840> on<00:01:46.079> you<00:01:46.170> have<00:01:46.380> to<00:01:46.409> eat<00:01:46.710> meat<00:01:47.009> you<00:01:47.610> know

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 
mouth on you have to eat meat you know

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:49.429 
mouth on you have to eat meat you know
if<00:01:47.970> you<00:01:48.060> put<00:01:48.210> a<00:01:48.240> herbivorous<00:01:48.960> mouth<00:01:49.170> on<00:01:49.320> you

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:49.439 
if you put a herbivorous mouth on you

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:51.889 
if you put a herbivorous mouth on you
have<00:01:49.619> to<00:01:49.649> eat<00:01:49.920> fruit<00:01:50.189> and<00:01:50.460> I<00:01:50.939> think<00:01:51.659> that's<00:01:51.810> the

00:01:51.889 --> 00:01:51.899 
have to eat fruit and I think that's the

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:53.389 
have to eat fruit and I think that's the
heart<00:01:52.200> and<00:01:52.350> soul<00:01:52.500> of<00:01:52.560> creature<00:01:52.950> game<00:01:53.159> you<00:01:53.310> know

00:01:53.389 --> 00:01:53.399 
heart and soul of creature game you know

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:55.069 
heart and soul of creature game you know
this<00:01:53.610> idea<00:01:53.909> that<00:01:53.939> I<00:01:54.119> made<00:01:54.360> something<00:01:54.659> and<00:01:54.960> now

00:01:55.069 --> 00:01:55.079 
this idea that I made something and now

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:56.959 
this idea that I made something and now
my<00:01:55.350> game<00:01:55.829> changes<00:01:56.340> because<00:01:56.640> of<00:01:56.759> the<00:01:56.850> way<00:01:56.939> i

00:01:56.959 --> 00:01:56.969 
my game changes because of the way i

00:01:56.969 --> 00:01:59.030 
my game changes because of the way i
made<00:01:57.210> my<00:01:57.390> creature<00:01:57.630> you<00:01:58.229> got<00:01:58.350> a<00:01:58.380> much<00:01:58.680> stronger

00:01:59.030 --> 00:01:59.040 
made my creature you got a much stronger

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:00.620 
made my creature you got a much stronger
game<00:01:59.399> and<00:01:59.610> a<00:01:59.640> much<00:01:59.759> more<00:01:59.790> interesting<00:02:00.180> thing

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:00.630 
game and a much more interesting thing

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:02.990 
game and a much more interesting thing
to<00:02:00.659> build<00:02:00.990> then<00:02:01.290> to<00:02:01.500> just<00:02:01.770> say<00:02:02.070> i<00:02:02.310> have

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:03.000 
to build then to just say i have

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.660 
to build then to just say i have
predefined<00:02:03.390> things<00:02:04.200> i<00:02:04.320> can<00:02:04.500> do<00:02:04.649> and<00:02:04.920> i<00:02:05.399> can

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:05.670 
predefined things i can do and i can

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:13.470 
predefined things i can do and i can
make<00:02:05.790> something<00:02:05.969> that<00:02:06.060> looks<00:02:06.090> different

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:13.480 

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:16.120 

to<00:02:14.480> give<00:02:14.630> his<00:02:14.750> like<00:02:14.900> the<00:02:15.020> technology<00:02:15.560> stuff<00:02:15.920> I

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:16.130 
to give his like the technology stuff I

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:17.530 
to give his like the technology stuff I
had<00:02:16.400> to<00:02:16.430> have<00:02:16.760> some<00:02:16.940> very<00:02:17.180> serious

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:17.540 
had to have some very serious

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:19.600 
had to have some very serious
programmers<00:02:18.530> they<00:02:19.040> could<00:02:19.190> go<00:02:19.280> in<00:02:19.310> and<00:02:19.430> solve

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:19.610 
programmers they could go in and solve

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:20.710 
programmers they could go in and solve
fun<00:02:19.820> little<00:02:19.940> problems<00:02:20.330> it<00:02:20.420> had<00:02:20.540> not<00:02:20.660> been

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:20.720 
fun little problems it had not been

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:22.930 
fun little problems it had not been
solved<00:02:21.170> before<00:02:21.310> you<00:02:22.310> know<00:02:22.400> cuz<00:02:22.610> Hecker<00:02:22.790> was

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:22.940 
solved before you know cuz Hecker was

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:24.520 
solved before you know cuz Hecker was
brought<00:02:23.390> in<00:02:23.570> to<00:02:23.780> work<00:02:24.140> on<00:02:24.230> the<00:02:24.320> animation

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:24.530 
brought in to work on the animation

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:26.530 
brought in to work on the animation
system<00:02:24.860> which<00:02:25.130> probably<00:02:25.370> was<00:02:26.090> the<00:02:26.120> single

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:26.540 
system which probably was the single

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:28.750 
system which probably was the single
hardest<00:02:27.050> technical<00:02:27.620> problem<00:02:27.950> we<00:02:27.980> faced<00:02:28.460> in

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:28.760 
hardest technical problem we faced in

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:30.850 
hardest technical problem we faced in
Spore<00:02:29.240> you<00:02:30.110> know<00:02:30.170> we<00:02:30.260> did<00:02:30.350> a<00:02:30.380> lot<00:02:30.500> of<00:02:30.530> research

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:30.860 
Spore you know we did a lot of research

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:32.410 
Spore you know we did a lot of research
finding<00:02:31.220> out<00:02:31.340> what<00:02:31.850> the<00:02:31.940> state<00:02:32.120> of<00:02:32.150> the<00:02:32.270> art

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:32.420 
finding out what the state of the art

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:33.790 
finding out what the state of the art
and<00:02:32.570> this<00:02:32.810> was<00:02:33.020> and<00:02:33.290> there<00:02:33.410> was<00:02:33.440> very<00:02:33.740> very

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:33.800 
and this was and there was very very

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:35.890 
and this was and there was very very
little<00:02:34.130> work<00:02:34.250> in<00:02:34.430> this<00:02:34.520> actually<00:02:34.970> and<00:02:35.630> i<00:02:35.750> think

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:35.900 
little work in this actually and i think

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:37.030 
little work in this actually and i think
we<00:02:35.990> probably<00:02:36.110> advanced<00:02:36.590> the<00:02:36.680> state<00:02:36.890> of<00:02:36.920> the

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:37.040 
we probably advanced the state of the

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:39.220 
we probably advanced the state of the
art<00:02:37.190> by<00:02:37.340> several<00:02:37.700> years<00:02:38.090> in<00:02:38.300> you<00:02:39.140> know

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:39.230 
art by several years in you know

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:45.220 
art by several years in you know
procedural<00:02:39.620> animation<00:02:39.740> i<00:02:43.780> think<00:02:44.780> the<00:02:44.870> easiest

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:45.230 
procedural animation i think the easiest

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:47.590 
procedural animation i think the easiest
way<00:02:45.530> to<00:02:45.590> describe<00:02:45.850> what<00:02:46.850> procedure<00:02:47.240> ilysm<00:02:47.510> in

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:47.600 
way to describe what procedure ilysm in

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:49.270 
way to describe what procedure ilysm in
the<00:02:47.660> census<00:02:47.900> for<00:02:48.170> means<00:02:48.410> it<00:02:48.560> is<00:02:48.830> we<00:02:49.160> have<00:02:49.250> to

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:49.280 
the census for means it is we have to

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:50.800 
the census for means it is we have to
teach<00:02:49.550> the<00:02:49.760> computer<00:02:50.120> how<00:02:50.240> to<00:02:50.270> do<00:02:50.480> something

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:50.810 
teach the computer how to do something

contrast<00:03:22.070> and<00:03:22.340> a<00:03:22.400> game<00:03:22.520> like<00:03:22.610> score<00:03:23.000> all<00:03:23.630> that

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:23.870 
contrast and a game like score all that

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:25.120 
contrast and a game like score all that
stuff<00:03:24.080> has<00:03:24.200> to<00:03:24.290> take<00:03:24.440> place<00:03:24.560> automatically

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:25.130 
stuff has to take place automatically

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:27.040 
stuff has to take place automatically
and<00:03:25.340> on-the-fly<00:03:25.600> internally<00:03:26.600> inside<00:03:26.750> the

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:27.050 
and on-the-fly internally inside the

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:28.780 
and on-the-fly internally inside the
game<00:03:27.200> we<00:03:27.500> have<00:03:27.590> to<00:03:27.680> be<00:03:27.710> able<00:03:27.800> to<00:03:27.980> build<00:03:28.580> the

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:28.790 
game we have to be able to build the

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:30.640 
game we have to be able to build the
geography<00:03:29.450> of<00:03:29.480> the<00:03:29.630> world<00:03:29.810> that<00:03:29.990> terrain<00:03:30.440> the

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:30.650 
geography of the world that terrain the

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:32.170 
geography of the world that terrain the
oceans<00:03:31.040> in<00:03:31.190> the<00:03:31.250> mountain<00:03:31.520> ranges<00:03:31.790> and<00:03:32.030> we

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:32.180 
oceans in the mountain ranges and we

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:33.430 
oceans in the mountain ranges and we
about<00:03:32.300> half<00:03:32.480> a<00:03:32.510> second<00:03:32.870> to<00:03:32.900> build<00:03:33.080> that<00:03:33.170> world

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:33.440 
about half a second to build that world

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:34.900 
about half a second to build that world
and<00:03:33.620> we<00:03:33.800> have<00:03:33.890> to<00:03:33.980> build<00:03:34.160> all<00:03:34.340> the<00:03:34.580> the

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:34.910 
and we have to build all the the

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:36.250 
and we have to build all the the
buildings<00:03:35.300> and<00:03:35.420> vehicles<00:03:35.510> you<00:03:36.080> have<00:03:36.170> to

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:36.260 
buildings and vehicles you have to

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:37.300 
buildings and vehicles you have to
populate<00:03:36.590> the<00:03:36.710> whole<00:03:36.860> world<00:03:37.100> all<00:03:37.220> the

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:37.310 
populate the whole world all the

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:38.440 
populate the whole world all the
creatures<00:03:37.580> would<00:03:37.760> that<00:03:37.970> might<00:03:38.090> take<00:03:38.180> another

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:38.450 
creatures would that might take another

00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:39.850 
creatures would that might take another
couple<00:03:38.540> of<00:03:38.660> seconds<00:03:39.020> so<00:03:39.080> we've<00:03:39.200> got<00:03:39.320> you<00:03:39.770> know

00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:39.860 
couple of seconds so we've got you know

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:41.920 
couple of seconds so we've got you know
maybe<00:03:40.070> eight<00:03:40.340> seconds<00:03:40.850> maybe<00:03:41.000> ten<00:03:41.270> seconds<00:03:41.720> to

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:41.930 
maybe eight seconds maybe ten seconds to

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:44.260 
maybe eight seconds maybe ten seconds to
go<00:03:42.050> from<00:03:42.080> nothing<00:03:42.740> to<00:03:42.980> a<00:03:43.220> world<00:03:43.520> with<00:03:43.940> weather

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:44.270 
go from nothing to a world with weather

00:03:44.270 --> 00:03:47.050 
go from nothing to a world with weather
and<00:03:44.720> plants<00:03:45.320> and<00:03:45.590> cities<00:03:46.130> and<00:03:46.490> vehicles

00:03:47.050 --> 00:03:47.060 
and plants and cities and vehicles

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:48.520 
and plants and cities and vehicles
driving<00:03:47.300> around<00:03:47.540> and<00:03:47.840> creatures<00:03:48.200> living<00:03:48.410> on

00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:48.530 
driving around and creatures living on

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:51.550 
driving around and creatures living on
it<00:03:48.680> so<00:03:49.310> I<00:03:49.340> was<00:03:49.610> digging<00:03:49.910> recipes<00:03:50.510> for<00:03:50.720> creating

00:03:51.550 --> 00:03:51.560 
it so I was digging recipes for creating

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:53.230 
it so I was digging recipes for creating
a<00:03:51.620> building<00:03:51.980> so<00:03:52.520> when<00:03:52.640> the<00:03:52.730> player<00:03:52.910> creates<00:03:53.180> a

00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:53.240 
a building so when the player creates a

00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:54.760 
a building so when the player creates a
building<00:03:53.540> what<00:03:54.170> they're<00:03:54.290> really<00:03:54.410> doing<00:03:54.530> is

00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:54.770 
building what they're really doing is

00:03:54.770 --> 00:03:56.080 
building what they're really doing is
they're<00:03:54.920> writing<00:03:55.190> a<00:03:55.250> recipe<00:03:55.640> for<00:03:55.790> creating<00:03:56.060> a

00:03:56.080 --> 00:03:56.090 
they're writing a recipe for creating a

00:03:56.090 --> 00:03:58.120 
they're writing a recipe for creating a
building<00:03:56.390> and<00:03:56.510> the<00:03:57.020> recipe<00:03:57.410> gets<00:03:57.740> sent<00:03:58.070> to

00:03:58.120 --> 00:03:58.130 
building and the recipe gets sent to

00:03:58.130 --> 00:03:59.590 
building and the recipe gets sent to
everyone<00:03:58.370> else<00:03:58.550> is<00:03:58.640> playing<00:03:58.790> the<00:03:58.940> game<00:03:59.120> so<00:03:59.480> the

00:03:59.590 --> 00:03:59.600 
everyone else is playing the game so the

00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:00.940 
everyone else is playing the game so the
player<00:03:59.840> and<00:04:00.020> the<00:04:00.110> background<00:04:00.560> downloads<00:04:00.890> a

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:00.950 
player and the background downloads a

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:02.700 
player and the background downloads a
recipe<00:04:01.280> for<00:04:01.430> a<00:04:01.459> creature<00:04:01.640> and<00:04:01.970> then

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:02.710 
recipe for a creature and then

00:04:02.710 --> 00:04:04.710 
recipe for a creature and then
have<00:04:02.830> to<00:04:02.980> reconstitute<00:04:03.580> that<00:04:03.850> recipe<00:04:04.240> is<00:04:04.390> as<00:04:04.690> a

00:04:04.710 --> 00:04:04.720 
have to reconstitute that recipe is as a

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:06.570 
have to reconstitute that recipe is as a
creature<00:04:04.990> in<00:04:05.230> level<00:04:05.920> where<00:04:06.130> the<00:04:06.220> player<00:04:06.400> needs

00:04:06.570 --> 00:04:06.580 
creature in level where the player needs

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:08.310 
creature in level where the player needs
to<00:04:06.730> see<00:04:06.850> it<00:04:06.940> in<00:04:07.090> you<00:04:07.390> know<00:04:07.510> half<00:04:07.780> a<00:04:07.870> second<00:04:08.170> for

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:08.320 
to see it in you know half a second for

00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:09.930 
to see it in you know half a second for
a<00:04:08.350> second<00:04:08.650> or<00:04:08.710> so<00:04:08.740> in<00:04:09.100> Spore<00:04:09.490> we're<00:04:09.640> sort<00:04:09.790> of<00:04:09.820> in

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:09.940 
a second or so in Spore we're sort of in

00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:11.280 
a second or so in Spore we're sort of in
sometimes<00:04:10.300> teaching<00:04:10.600> the<00:04:10.690> computer<00:04:10.990> to<00:04:11.080> fish

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:11.290 
sometimes teaching the computer to fish

00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:12.870 
sometimes teaching the computer to fish
for<00:04:11.530> all<00:04:11.980> of<00:04:12.100> these<00:04:12.220> things<00:04:12.400> how<00:04:12.640> do<00:04:12.700> you

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:12.880 
for all of these things how do you

00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:14.130 
for all of these things how do you
generate<00:04:12.970> a<00:04:13.180> mesh<00:04:13.390> how<00:04:13.750> do<00:04:13.810> you<00:04:13.900> make<00:04:14.050> an

00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:14.140 
generate a mesh how do you make an

00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:15.930 
generate a mesh how do you make an
animation<00:04:14.440> across<00:04:14.890> you<00:04:15.310> know<00:04:15.340> work<00:04:15.730> across

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:15.940 
animation across you know work across

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:17.130 
animation across you know work across
multiple<00:04:16.030> creatures<00:04:16.660> and<00:04:16.810> things<00:04:16.930> like<00:04:17.080> that

the<00:04:17.500> programming<00:04:17.920> become<00:04:18.190> sort<00:04:18.400> of<00:04:18.430> this

00:04:18.540 --> 00:04:18.550 
the programming become sort of this

00:04:18.550 --> 00:04:19.770 
the programming become sort of this
teaching<00:04:18.820> process<00:04:19.000> of<00:04:19.300> the<00:04:19.360> computer<00:04:19.660> as

opposed to this telling it how it is but

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:22.710 
opposed to this telling it how it is but
you<00:04:21.670> know<00:04:21.730> that's<00:04:21.940> something<00:04:22.180> that<00:04:22.210> involves

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:22.720 
you know that's something that involves

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:25.020 
you know that's something that involves
kind<00:04:22.810> of<00:04:22.930> deep<00:04:23.110> scary<00:04:23.530> voodoo<00:04:23.950> math<00:04:24.160> it's<00:04:24.820> kind

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:25.030 
kind of deep scary voodoo math it's kind

00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:26.190 
kind of deep scary voodoo math it's kind
of<00:04:25.060> thing<00:04:25.240> where<00:04:25.360> you<00:04:25.510> just<00:04:25.540> kind<00:04:25.840> of<00:04:25.930> put<00:04:26.110> you

00:05:50.310 --> 00:05:50.320 
was a unique challenge because we had

00:05:50.320 --> 00:05:51.900 
was a unique challenge because we had

the<00:06:06.100> player<00:06:06.280> I<00:06:06.520> don't<00:06:06.700> have<00:06:06.760> a<00:06:06.820> great<00:06:07.090> creature

00:06:07.380 --> 00:06:07.390 
the player I don't have a great creature

00:06:07.390 --> 00:06:09.660 
the player I don't have a great creature
and<00:06:07.750> so<00:06:08.080> you've<00:06:08.260> got<00:06:08.290> kind<00:06:08.770> of<00:06:09.010> open-ended

00:06:09.660 --> 00:06:09.670 
and so you've got kind of open-ended

00:06:09.670 --> 00:06:11.370 
and so you've got kind of open-ended
color<00:06:10.240> choices<00:06:10.450> that<00:06:10.660> the<00:06:10.750> players<00:06:10.960> making<00:06:11.200> at

00:06:11.370 --> 00:06:11.380 
color choices that the players making at

00:06:11.380 --> 00:06:12.750 
color choices that the players making at
every<00:06:11.560> stage<00:06:11.740> of<00:06:11.830> the<00:06:11.919> game<00:06:12.040> but<00:06:12.310> all<00:06:12.460> this<00:06:12.580> has

00:06:12.750 --> 00:06:12.760 
every stage of the game but all this has

00:06:12.760 --> 00:06:15.180 
every stage of the game but all this has
to<00:06:12.910> sort<00:06:13.450> of<00:06:13.510> blend<00:06:14.110> together<00:06:14.290> into<00:06:14.800> one

00:06:15.180 --> 00:06:15.190 
to sort of blend together into one

00:06:15.190 --> 00:06:17.220 
to sort of blend together into one
world<00:06:15.580> and<00:06:15.910> so<00:06:16.420> we<00:06:16.750> spent<00:06:16.960> all<00:06:17.050> this<00:06:17.170> time

00:06:17.220 --> 00:06:17.230 
world and so we spent all this time

00:06:17.230 --> 00:06:20.370 
world and so we spent all this time
making<00:06:18.190> disguise<00:06:19.060> had<00:06:19.660> sort<00:06:20.200> of<00:06:20.230> these

00:06:20.370 --> 00:06:20.380 
making disguise had sort of these

00:06:20.380 --> 00:06:21.690 
making disguise had sort of these
beautiful<00:06:20.740> colors<00:06:20.860> that<00:06:21.160> were<00:06:21.250> informed<00:06:21.640> by

00:06:21.690 --> 00:06:21.700 
beautiful colors that were informed by

00:06:21.700 --> 00:06:23.340 
beautiful colors that were informed by
the<00:06:21.820> color<00:06:22.120> of<00:06:22.180> the<00:06:22.300> Sun<00:06:22.570> so<00:06:22.630> you<00:06:22.930> have<00:06:23.080> the<00:06:23.140> Sun

00:06:23.340 --> 00:06:23.350 
the color of the Sun so you have the Sun

00:06:23.350 --> 00:06:25.860 
the color of the Sun so you have the Sun
up<00:06:23.470> there<00:06:23.500> and<00:06:23.800> then<00:06:23.920> you<00:06:24.400> get<00:06:24.580> this<00:06:24.730> glow<00:06:25.570> of

00:06:25.860 --> 00:06:25.870 
up there and then you get this glow of

00:06:25.870 --> 00:06:27.420 
up there and then you get this glow of
sunlight<00:06:26.230> through<00:06:26.440> the<00:06:26.500> atmosphere<00:06:26.620> and<00:06:27.100> that

00:06:27.420 --> 00:06:27.430 
sunlight through the atmosphere and that

00:06:27.430 --> 00:06:30.210 
sunlight through the atmosphere and that
would<00:06:27.550> Tintin<00:06:28.060> and<00:06:28.320> diffuse<00:06:29.320> through<00:06:29.710> the

00:06:30.210 --> 00:06:30.220 
would Tintin and diffuse through the

00:06:30.220 --> 00:06:31.710 
would Tintin and diffuse through the
land<00:06:30.460> and<00:06:30.700> so<00:06:30.820> the<00:06:30.940> land<00:06:31.150> would<00:06:31.270> blend<00:06:31.570> into

00:06:31.710 --> 00:06:31.720 
land and so the land would blend into

00:06:31.720 --> 00:06:32.820 
land and so the land would blend into
the<00:06:31.840> color<00:06:32.020> of<00:06:32.080> the<00:06:32.200> sky<00:06:32.410> and<00:06:32.650> then<00:06:32.740> the

00:06:32.820 --> 00:06:32.830 
the color of the sky and then the

00:06:32.830 --> 00:06:35.010 
the color of the sky and then the
creatures<00:06:33.190> would<00:06:33.490> all<00:06:33.640> be<00:06:34.180> lit<00:06:34.390> properly<00:06:34.630> by

00:06:35.010 --> 00:06:35.020 
creatures would all be lit properly by

00:06:35.020 --> 00:06:36.900 
creatures would all be lit properly by
sort<00:06:35.710> of<00:06:35.740> golden<00:06:36.160> light<00:06:36.190> of<00:06:36.400> sunset<00:06:36.760> for

00:06:36.900 --> 00:06:36.910 
sort of golden light of sunset for

00:06:36.910 --> 00:06:38.520 
sort of golden light of sunset for
example<00:06:37.270> or<00:06:37.390> the<00:06:37.420> bluish<00:06:37.840> light<00:06:37.870> of<00:06:38.200> midnight

00:06:38.520 --> 00:06:38.530 
example or the bluish light of midnight

00:06:38.530 --> 00:06:40.410 
example or the bluish light of midnight
and<00:06:38.740> so<00:06:39.130> no<00:06:39.310> matter<00:06:39.400> what<00:06:39.520> choices<00:06:39.970> the<00:06:40.210> player

00:06:40.410 --> 00:06:40.420 
and so no matter what choices the player

00:06:40.420 --> 00:06:42.030 
and so no matter what choices the player
makes<00:06:40.630> in<00:06:40.750> terms<00:06:40.900> of<00:06:41.020> color<00:06:41.260> we<00:06:41.740> had<00:06:41.860> to<00:06:41.920> make

00:06:42.030 --> 00:06:42.040 
makes in terms of color we had to make

00:06:42.040 --> 00:06:44.160 
makes in terms of color we had to make
sure<00:06:42.220> that<00:06:42.400> they<00:06:42.550> all<00:06:42.700> integrated<00:06:43.690> cleanly

00:06:44.160 --> 00:06:44.170 
sure that they all integrated cleanly

00:06:44.170 --> 00:06:46.320 
sure that they all integrated cleanly
into<00:06:44.320> the<00:06:44.620> color<00:06:44.830> palettes<00:06:45.160> of<00:06:45.250> the<00:06:45.370> world<00:06:45.520> we

00:06:46.320 --> 00:06:46.330 
into the color palettes of the world we

00:06:46.330 --> 00:06:47.730 
into the color palettes of the world we
knew<00:06:46.480> that<00:06:46.510> basically<00:06:46.960> almost<00:06:47.230> everything<00:06:47.680> in

00:06:47.730 --> 00:06:47.740 
knew that basically almost everything in

00:06:47.740 --> 00:06:49.290 
knew that basically almost everything in
the<00:06:47.800> game<00:06:47.920> wanted<00:06:48.250> to<00:06:48.310> have<00:06:48.430> a<00:06:48.460> procedural<00:06:49.120> or

00:06:49.290 --> 00:06:49.300 
the game wanted to have a procedural or

00:06:49.300 --> 00:06:51.240 
the game wanted to have a procedural or
generative<00:06:49.780> basis<00:06:50.170> so<00:06:50.560> the<00:06:50.650> computer<00:06:50.920> can

00:06:51.240 --> 00:06:51.250 
generative basis so the computer can

00:06:51.250 --> 00:06:55.020 
generative basis so the computer can
create<00:06:51.540> animations<00:06:52.540> planets<00:06:53.290> models<00:06:53.970> one<00:06:54.970> of

00:06:55.020 --> 00:06:55.030 
create animations planets models one of

00:06:55.030 --> 00:06:56.340 
create animations planets models one of
the<00:06:55.090> things<00:06:55.150> that<00:06:55.360> I<00:06:55.450> thought<00:06:55.660> was<00:06:55.870> just<00:06:56.170> kind

00:06:56.340 --> 00:06:56.350 
the things that I thought was just kind

00:06:56.350 --> 00:06:57.750 
the things that I thought was just kind
of<00:06:56.410> out<00:06:56.680> of<00:06:56.830> the<00:06:56.980> room<00:06:57.100> the<00:06:57.130> possibility<00:06:57.730> for

00:06:57.750 --> 00:06:57.760 
of out of the room the possibility for

00:06:57.760 --> 00:06:59.640 
of out of the room the possibility for
us<00:06:58.030> was<00:06:58.240> having<00:06:58.810> the<00:06:58.900> computer<00:06:59.230> composed<00:06:59.530> the

00:06:59.640 --> 00:06:59.650 
us was having the computer composed the

00:06:59.650 --> 00:07:02.010 
us was having the computer composed the
music<00:06:59.760> procedurally<00:07:00.760> on<00:07:00.910> the<00:07:01.000> fly<00:07:01.180> and<00:07:01.480> that

00:07:02.010 --> 00:07:02.020 
music procedurally on the fly and that

00:07:02.020 --> 00:07:02.940 
music procedurally on the fly and that
was<00:07:02.110> something<00:07:02.260> about<00:07:02.410> halfway<00:07:02.650> through<00:07:02.860> the

00:07:02.940 --> 00:07:02.950 
was something about halfway through the

00:07:02.950 --> 00:07:05.700 
was something about halfway through the
project<00:07:02.980> Brian<00:07:03.910> Eno<00:07:04.150> came<00:07:04.420> on<00:07:04.660> involved<00:07:05.560> and

00:07:05.700 --> 00:07:05.710 
project Brian Eno came on involved and

00:07:05.710 --> 00:07:07.830 
project Brian Eno came on involved and
so<00:07:06.040> we<00:07:06.160> actually<00:07:06.310> ended<00:07:06.580> up<00:07:06.730> cheating<00:07:07.420> that<00:07:07.690> as

00:07:07.830 --> 00:07:07.840 
so we actually ended up cheating that as

00:07:07.840 --> 00:07:09.660 
so we actually ended up cheating that as
well<00:07:08.020> Brian<00:07:08.350> Eno<00:07:08.530> came<00:07:08.770> in<00:07:08.890> about<00:07:09.130> two<00:07:09.490> years

00:07:09.660 --> 00:07:09.670 
well Brian Eno came in about two years

00:07:09.670 --> 00:07:12.480 
well Brian Eno came in about two years
ago<00:07:09.790> so<00:07:10.420> when<00:07:10.750> he<00:07:10.990> first<00:07:11.380> arrived<00:07:11.710> he<00:07:12.190> spent

00:07:12.480 --> 00:07:12.490 
ago so when he first arrived he spent

00:07:12.490 --> 00:07:14.250 
ago so when he first arrived he spent
about<00:07:12.730> a<00:07:12.790> week<00:07:12.850> here<00:07:13.480> would<00:07:13.780> make<00:07:13.810> amazing

00:07:14.250 --> 00:07:14.260 
about a week here would make amazing

00:07:14.260 --> 00:07:16.590 
about a week here would make amazing
sounds<00:07:14.890> and<00:07:15.040> we<00:07:15.100> would<00:07:15.250> sample<00:07:15.490> them<00:07:15.790> and<00:07:16.030> get

00:07:16.590 --> 00:07:16.600 
sounds and we would sample them and get

00:07:16.600 --> 00:07:18.390 
sounds and we would sample them and get
them<00:07:16.750> playing<00:07:16.990> back<00:07:17.230> and<00:07:17.530> sort<00:07:17.740> of<00:07:17.860> all<00:07:18.010> sort

00:07:18.390 --> 00:07:18.400 
them playing back and sort of all sort

00:07:18.400 --> 00:07:20.550 
them playing back and sort of all sort
of<00:07:18.430> will<00:07:18.820> and<00:07:19.120> Brian<00:07:19.390> and<00:07:19.690> I<00:07:19.780> would<00:07:19.960> also<00:07:20.110> just

00:07:20.550 --> 00:07:20.560 
of will and Brian and I would also just

00:07:20.560 --> 00:07:22.260 
of will and Brian and I would also just
be<00:07:20.680> you<00:07:21.070> know<00:07:21.190> hunched<00:07:21.820> over<00:07:21.940> the<00:07:22.090> computer

00:07:22.260 --> 00:07:22.270 
be you know hunched over the computer

00:07:22.270 --> 00:07:25.860 
be you know hunched over the computer
for<00:07:22.600> a<00:07:22.660> while<00:07:22.810> and<00:07:23.050> coming<00:07:23.500> up<00:07:23.590> with<00:07:23.650> ideas
