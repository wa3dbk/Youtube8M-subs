00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:34.620 
had no idea what it actually was because

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:37.699 
had no idea what it actually was because
it<00:02:34.800> thought<00:02:35.099> that<00:02:35.489> it<00:02:35.640> was<00:02:36.000> Alec<00:02:36.750> Holland<00:02:37.140> it

00:02:37.699 --> 00:02:37.709 
it thought that it was Alec Holland it

00:02:37.709 --> 00:02:39.530

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:41.270 
defended the green for years and it did
an<00:02:39.630> amazing<00:02:39.900> job<00:02:40.140> considering<00:02:40.950> that<00:02:41.190> it

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:41.280 
an amazing job considering that it

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:43.309 
an amazing job considering that it
wasn't<00:02:41.519> actually<00:02:42.090> the<00:02:42.239> champion<00:02:42.690> but

00:02:43.309 --> 00:02:43.319 
wasn't actually the champion but

00:02:43.319 --> 00:02:45.530 
wasn't actually the champion but
eventually<00:02:43.560> it<00:02:44.250> discovered<00:02:44.849> the<00:02:44.970> truth<00:02:45.269> and

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:45.540 
eventually it discovered the truth and

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:47.240 
eventually it discovered the truth and
through<00:02:45.750> a<00:02:45.810> series<00:02:45.900> of<00:02:46.290> events<00:02:46.500> allowed<00:02:47.099> his

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:47.250 
through a series of events allowed his

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:49.550 
through a series of events allowed his
own<00:02:47.459> consciousness<00:02:48.000> to<00:02:48.660> flee<00:02:48.989> into<00:02:49.170> space

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:49.560 
own consciousness to flee into space

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:51.289 
own consciousness to flee into space
where<00:02:49.860> it<00:02:49.890> could<00:02:50.100> find<00:02:50.340> a<00:02:50.459> home<00:02:50.610> of<00:02:50.819> its<00:02:50.940> own<00:02:51.120> to

00:02:51.289 --> 00:02:51.299 
where it could find a home of its own to

00:02:51.299 --> 00:02:51.800 
where it could find a home of its own to
live<00:02:51.480> on

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:51.810 
live on

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:54.080

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:54.090 
luckily the Parliament was patient and

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:56.360 
luckily the Parliament was patient and
Alec<00:02:54.780> Holland<00:02:55.200> actually<00:02:55.680> survived<00:02:56.069> in<00:02:56.280> the

it<00:03:04.080> he<00:03:04.470> finally<00:03:04.950> understood<00:03:05.370> what<00:03:05.489> the<00:03:05.640> Green

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:05.880 
it he finally understood what the Green

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:08.750 
it he finally understood what the Green
was<00:03:06.239> but<00:03:07.019> he<00:03:07.470> felt<00:03:07.769> that<00:03:07.860> he<00:03:07.950> gave<00:03:08.160> too<00:03:08.400> much<00:03:08.549> to
