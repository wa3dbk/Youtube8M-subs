 keeping in the background that's what 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:22.590
 it's a coaches usually do 

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:23.550
 Raster's new fedrow ks needs it 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:26.279
 but do not hide 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:26.820
 the Spaniard knows what he does and knows what 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:29.039
 he wants 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:30.480
 from the player of the continuous 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:32.969
 concentrated dedicated 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:35.450
 facial expression already betrays here 

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:37.440
 someone's task very seriously 

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:38.760
 So I do not even know me 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:39.930
 watch training I have really synonymous 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:41.610
 not thought about it yet 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:43.559
 as a coach I want to be like the players 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:44.520
 Do my best and you'll be fine 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:46.590
 goes to leighton 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:47.910
 if I doing THAT CONDITION particularly serious good 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:50.610
 then that is so but I am not 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:52.289
 tighter type of discipline but that is 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:55.140
 important to me that I expect from the 

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:57.719
 So I work with them oliver 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:59.699
 macke clear whether janko and matt reed 

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:01.890
 are that day in rasta dome the 

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:04.710
 first official team training is on the rise 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:06.630
 14 august another three weeks so that has 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:09.000
 trainers team already in vechta 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:12.600
 because of the players to get for 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:14.490
 the prelude of pre-season andreas ended 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:15.540
 are satisfied the guys work well 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:18.090
 and are with the right attitude 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:19.979
 while they push each other that 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:21.360
 Of course it helps to be clear that we are still 

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:22.979
 need more time to get them for the 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:26.210
 preparation to get fully fit 

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:28.979
 but there we are on a good way 

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:29.610
 pedros way followed him in 2012 

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:31.380
 quakenbrück 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:33.259
 three years he was as co and 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:35.939
 athletic coach at the artland dragons 

00:01:33.259 --> 00:01:38.460
 married is the 32-year-old with the 

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:38.939
 Spanish veterinarian Anna works for her 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:40.920
 in transition 

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:43.140
 both have settled in well 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:45.000
 vechta a goodbye with friends and 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:46.920
 but there are already known on the 12th 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.619
 september then play the artland 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:50.939
 dragons in the rasta dome 

00:01:48.619 --> 00:01:52.619
 i was in quakenbrück for three years 

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:53.970
 you do not forget that fast and 

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:55.170
 I 'm still grateful to the dragons 

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:57.210
 for the chance you gave me back then 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:58.890
 Therefore, I am pleased too 

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:00.810
 very few people to meet again 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:02.369
 who have accompanied me there the game 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:04.590
 is for me personally so already one 

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:06.920
 great thing but for the club it is a 

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:10.380
 normal preparation game 

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:12.300
 usually the season is 2015/2016 

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:15.120
 not be grid continues to have 

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:16.890
 ambitious goals as well as k s he has the 

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:19.020
 highest coaching license of the spanish 

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:21.230
 basketballverbandes but also with 

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:23.280
 The ball on the foot is a good figure 

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:24.690
 I honestly do not know why we 

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:26.040
 save so successful in the 

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:27.600
 last years but germany has yes 

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:29.940
 also great athletes in football handball 

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:31.200
 tennis basketball so in this point 

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:33.870
 we really seem very similar 

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:36.240
 to be and just like his boss coach 

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:38.700
 Andreas Wagner looks Pedro came all the way 

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:40.530

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:42.150
