designs to display not one is better

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:09.440 
designs to display not one is better
than<00:01:07.770> the<00:01:07.890> other<00:01:08.070> the<00:01:08.670> reason<00:01:08.880> I'm<00:01:09.210> showing

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450 
than the other the reason I'm showing

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:11.030 
than the other the reason I'm showing
this<00:01:09.659> one<00:01:09.930> is<00:01:10.080> simply<00:01:10.470> it's<00:01:10.619> the<00:01:10.740> one<00:01:10.920> that

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
this one is simply it's the one that

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:14.510 
this one is simply it's the one that

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
when Ron is in the life what's really

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:28.850 
when Ron is in the life what's really
interesting<00:01:27.150> about<00:01:27.509> this<00:01:27.869> particular<00:01:28.290> blade

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
interesting about this particular blade

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:30.590 
interesting about this particular blade
is<00:01:29.430> how<00:01:29.759> that<00:01:29.820> the<00:01:30.180> weight<00:01:30.390> has<00:01:30.570> been

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
is how that the weight has been

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:33.050 
is how that the weight has been
distributed<00:01:31.430> forward<00:01:32.430> and<00:01:32.640> it's<00:01:32.790> so<00:01:32.939> it's

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
distributed forward and it's so it's

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:36.020 
distributed forward and it's so it's
dispersed<00:01:33.479> forward<00:01:34.110> on<00:01:34.350> the<00:01:34.560> blade<00:01:35.189> in<00:01:35.579> a

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
dispersed forward on the blade in a

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:38.480 
dispersed forward on the blade in a
curved<00:01:36.420> type<00:01:37.350> of<00:01:37.500> angle<00:01:37.890> here<00:01:38.100> you<00:01:38.159> can<00:01:38.310> see

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.490 
curved type of angle here you can see

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:40.460 
curved type of angle here you can see
that<00:01:38.700> and<00:01:39.000> it<00:01:39.689> makes<00:01:39.900> the<00:01:40.079> way<00:01:40.229> to<00:01:40.290> move

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 
that and it makes the way to move

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:44.300 
that and it makes the way to move
forward<00:01:40.829> for<00:01:40.950> chopping<00:01:41.250> or<00:01:42.170> cutting<00:01:43.310> things

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310 
forward for chopping or cutting things

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:49.100 
forward for chopping or cutting things
like<00:01:44.399> wood<00:01:44.759> or<00:01:45.450> anything<00:01:46.409> else<00:01:47.630> it's<00:01:48.630> got<00:01:48.810> an<00:01:48.960> X

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 
like wood or anything else it's got an X

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:51.800 
like wood or anything else it's got an X
which<00:01:49.350> what<00:01:49.619> do<00:01:49.680> you<00:01:49.770> know<00:01:49.920> it's<00:01:50.570> front<00:01:51.570> heavy

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:51.810 
which what do you know it's front heavy

it's got a nice weight to it

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:57.100 
it's got a nice weight to it
natural<00:01:54.630> feel<00:01:54.900> to<00:01:55.170> the<00:01:55.560> way<00:01:55.680> that<00:01:55.860> cuts<00:01:56.190> a
