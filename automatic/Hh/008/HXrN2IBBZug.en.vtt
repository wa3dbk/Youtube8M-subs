00:01:24.359 --> 00:01:24.369 
quickly especially on the shell ejection

00:01:24.369 --> 00:01:26.219 
quickly especially on the shell ejection
port<00:01:24.670> of<00:01:24.850> course<00:01:25.090> every<00:01:25.479> time<00:01:25.659> you<00:01:25.810> fire<00:01:26.079> the

00:01:26.219 --> 00:01:26.229 
port of course every time you fire the

00:01:26.229 --> 00:01:28.289 
port of course every time you fire the

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:31.810 
and it isn't very long before it starts

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:33.359 
and it isn't very long before it starts
to<00:01:31.899> come<00:01:32.049> away<00:01:32.259> literally<00:01:32.649> I've<00:01:32.890> skirmish

00:01:33.359 --> 00:01:33.369 
to come away literally I've skirmish

00:01:33.369 --> 00:01:35.190

this<00:01:33.520> probably<00:01:33.789> twice<00:01:34.060> now<00:01:34.420> probably<00:01:34.960> put

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:35.200 
this probably twice now probably put

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:37.349 
this probably twice now probably put
about<00:01:35.380> 100<00:01:35.890> 120<00:01:36.369> rounds<00:01:36.789> through<00:01:37.149> it<00:01:37.180> and

00:01:37.349 --> 00:01:37.359 
about 100 120 rounds through it and

00:01:37.359 --> 00:01:39.359 
about 100 120 rounds through it and
already<00:01:37.530> scratches<00:01:38.530> are<00:01:38.710> starting<00:01:39.100> to<00:01:39.189> take

00:01:39.359 --> 00:01:39.369 
already scratches are starting to take

00:01:39.369 --> 00:01:41.279 
already scratches are starting to take
away<00:01:39.609> that<00:01:39.759> paint<00:01:40.000> work<00:01:40.179> on<00:01:40.390> the<00:01:40.719> gold<00:01:40.960> in<00:01:41.170> a
