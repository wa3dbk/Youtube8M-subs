stage you know these elements are still

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:20.250 
stage you know these elements are still
there<00:02:18.130> but<00:02:18.370> really<00:02:19.060> the<00:02:19.180> focus<00:02:19.569> is<00:02:19.780> not<00:02:19.959> on

Metal Gear Solid if you got found then

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:26.710 
Metal Gear Solid if you got found then
you're<00:02:25.000> really<00:02:25.390> in<00:02:25.450> a<00:02:25.510> bad<00:02:25.660> position<00:02:25.810> and

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:26.720 
you're really in a bad position and

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:28.090 
you're really in a bad position and
often<00:02:26.840> times<00:02:27.020> they<00:02:27.140> lead<00:02:27.350> to<00:02:27.500> a<00:02:27.530> game<00:02:27.710> over<00:02:27.950> but

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:28.100 
often times they lead to a game over but

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:29.830 
often times they lead to a game over but
with<00:02:28.250> rising<00:02:28.640> you're<00:02:29.060> able<00:02:29.300> to<00:02:29.330> overcome<00:02:29.510> that

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:29.840 
with rising you're able to overcome that

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:30.790 
with rising you're able to overcome that
even<00:02:30.170> if<00:02:30.230> you<00:02:30.320> are<00:02:30.440> found

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:30.800 
even if you are found

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:32.260 
even if you are found
you<00:02:30.890> can<00:02:31.040> still<00:02:31.280> fight<00:02:31.490> your<00:02:31.640> way<00:02:31.700> through<00:02:31.940> and

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:32.270 
you can still fight your way through and

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:34.090 
you can still fight your way through and
you<00:02:32.660> know<00:02:32.720> come<00:02:32.930> out<00:02:33.020> on<00:02:33.140> top<00:02:33.290> so<00:02:33.800> really<00:02:33.980> it's

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:34.100 
you know come out on top so really it's

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:35.500 
you know come out on top so really it's
up<00:02:34.160> to<00:02:34.250> the<00:02:34.340> player<00:02:34.580> to<00:02:34.610> decide<00:02:34.850> how<00:02:35.270> they<00:02:35.300> want

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:35.510 
up to the player to decide how they want

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:36.670 
up to the player to decide how they want
to<00:02:35.600> play<00:02:35.780> through<00:02:35.990> the<00:02:36.050> game<00:02:36.080> more<00:02:36.440> than<00:02:36.500> they

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:36.680 
to play through the game more than they

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:37.990 
to play through the game more than they
want<00:02:36.830> to<00:02:36.890> sneak<00:02:37.070> around<00:02:37.190> or<00:02:37.520> if<00:02:37.610> they<00:02:37.730> want<00:02:37.880> to

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:38.000

what I want to have people expect from

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:48.790 
what I want to have people expect from
rising<00:02:46.850> is<00:02:46.970> a<00:02:47.480> game<00:02:47.840> set<00:02:48.200> in<00:02:48.230> the<00:02:48.410> middle<00:02:48.650> gear

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:48.800 
rising is a game set in the middle gear

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:50.650 
rising is a game set in the middle gear
world<00:02:49.100> but<00:02:49.580> it's<00:02:49.940> completely<00:02:50.060> different<00:02:50.390> game

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:50.660

world but it's completely different game
play<00:02:50.870> you<00:02:51.110> know<00:02:51.290> if<00:02:51.380> you<00:02:51.470> look<00:02:51.620> back<00:02:51.770> at<00:02:51.830> the

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:52.160 
play you know if you look back at the

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:53.530 
play you know if you look back at the
original<00:02:52.250> Metal<00:02:52.670> Gear<00:02:52.700> series<00:02:52.940> it's<00:02:53.270> very

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:53.540 
original Metal Gear series it's very

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:55.030 
original Metal Gear series it's very
intense<00:02:53.900> if<00:02:54.200> you<00:02:54.320> play<00:02:54.500> it<00:02:54.620> for<00:02:54.650> one<00:02:54.920> or<00:02:55.010> two

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:55.040 
intense if you play it for one or two

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:57.820 
intense if you play it for one or two
hours<00:02:55.160> you<00:02:56.120> feel<00:02:56.330> physically<00:02:56.990> drained<00:02:57.320> you

00:02:57.820 --> 00:02:57.830 
hours you feel physically drained you

00:02:57.830 --> 00:02:59.470 
hours you feel physically drained you
know<00:02:57.920> uh<00:02:58.000> because<00:02:59.000> of<00:02:59.090> all<00:02:59.180> the<00:02:59.270> stress<00:02:59.420> that

00:02:59.470 --> 00:02:59.480 
know uh because of all the stress that

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:00.670 
know uh because of all the stress that
you're<00:02:59.660> feeling<00:02:59.780> from<00:02:59.990> the<00:03:00.170> game<00:03:00.320> it's<00:03:00.530> just

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:00.680 
you're feeling from the game it's just

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:02.980 
you're feeling from the game it's just
so<00:03:00.800> intense<00:03:01.070> but<00:03:01.820> rising<00:03:02.090> takes<00:03:02.540> the<00:03:02.690> opposite

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:02.990 
so intense but rising takes the opposite

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:04.210 
so intense but rising takes the opposite
approach<00:03:03.170> you<00:03:03.470> know<00:03:03.560> you're<00:03:03.709> playing<00:03:03.860> cyborg

00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:04.220 
approach you know you're playing cyborg

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:06.280 
approach you know you're playing cyborg
ridin<00:03:04.760> and<00:03:04.910> it's<00:03:05.510> really<00:03:05.660> about<00:03:05.750> relieving

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:06.290 
ridin and it's really about relieving

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:07.750 
ridin and it's really about relieving
stress<00:03:06.410> and<00:03:06.770> just<00:03:06.890> freely<00:03:07.310> cutting<00:03:07.610> through

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:07.760 
stress and just freely cutting through

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:10.000 
stress and just freely cutting through
things<00:03:08.000> just<00:03:08.330> enjoying<00:03:08.720> the<00:03:08.900> action<00:03:09.050> so<00:03:09.830> it

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:10.010 
things just enjoying the action so it

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:11.440 
things just enjoying the action so it
really<00:03:10.250> it's<00:03:10.520> the<00:03:10.640> polar<00:03:10.850> opposite<00:03:11.270> of

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:11.450 
really it's the polar opposite of

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:13.420 
really it's the polar opposite of
previous<00:03:11.870> Metal<00:03:12.050> Gear<00:03:12.200> games<00:03:12.650> but<00:03:12.980> set<00:03:13.280> in<00:03:13.370> the

previous Metal Gear games but set in the

previous Metal Gear games but set in the
military<00:03:13.760> universe<00:03:14.120> so<00:03:14.330> I<00:03:14.360> hope<00:03:14.570> people<00:03:14.600> can
