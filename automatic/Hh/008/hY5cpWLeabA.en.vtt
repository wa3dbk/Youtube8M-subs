cook some feasts and it doesn't seem to

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:17.539 
cook some feasts and it doesn't seem to
be<00:01:15.960> parking<00:01:16.259> so<00:01:16.409> I<00:01:16.470> don't<00:01:16.650> think<00:01:16.740> it's<00:01:16.860> in<00:01:17.070> the

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549 
be parking so I don't think it's in the

be parking so I don't think it's in the
game<00:01:17.729> proper<00:01:18.450> just<00:01:18.900> yet<00:01:19.140> so<00:01:19.290> we<00:01:19.439> might<00:01:19.680> not<00:01:19.799> get

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 
game proper just yet so we might not get

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:22.640 
game proper just yet so we might not get
n<00:01:20.100> 6.1<00:01:20.640> but<00:01:21.270> we<00:01:21.479> probably<00:01:21.900> should<00:01:22.320> I<00:01:22.470> mean<00:01:22.500> I

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650 
n 6.1 but we probably should I mean I

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:24.469 
n 6.1 but we probably should I mean I
between<00:01:22.860> the<00:01:22.950> PTR<00:01:23.369> files<00:01:23.640> it's<00:01:24.180> kind<00:01:24.360> of

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
between the PTR files it's kind of

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:26.870 
between the PTR files it's kind of
looking<00:01:24.810> that<00:01:25.020> way<00:01:25.170> but<00:01:25.860> all<00:01:26.159> it<00:01:26.280> uses<00:01:26.549> is<00:01:26.670> fish

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
looking that way but all it uses is fish

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:28.399 
looking that way but all it uses is fish
meaning<00:01:27.360> you<00:01:27.479> don't<00:01:27.600> have<00:01:27.780> to<00:01:27.900> go<00:01:28.020> through<00:01:28.259> the

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:28.409 
meaning you don't have to go through the

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:31.069 
meaning you don't have to go through the
stupid<00:01:28.799> hoop<00:01:28.979> that<00:01:29.549> is<00:01:29.790> trying<00:01:30.150> to<00:01:30.329> farm<00:01:30.750> for

stupid hoop that is trying to farm for
meat<00:01:31.409> and<00:01:31.619> this<00:01:32.250> also<00:01:32.490> means<00:01:32.820> because<00:01:33.299> fish<00:01:33.600> is

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 
meat and this also means because fish is

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:36.080 
meat and this also means because fish is
being<00:01:33.990> used<00:01:34.200> for<00:01:34.350> 125<00:01:35.130> stat<00:01:35.549> food<00:01:35.850> which<00:01:36.030> is

say right now try and get your hands on

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:47.899 
say right now try and get your hands on
some<00:01:45.030> cheap<00:01:45.689> fish<00:01:46.399> so<00:01:47.399> the<00:01:47.490> way<00:01:47.579> you<00:01:47.610> can<00:01:47.790> do

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:47.909 
some cheap fish so the way you can do

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:50.050 
some cheap fish so the way you can do
that<00:01:48.030> is<00:01:48.270> to<00:01:48.299> buy<00:01:48.570> the<00:01:48.630> fee<00:01:48.899> fish<00:01:49.409> themselves

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:50.060 
that is to buy the fee fish themselves

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:52.490 
that is to buy the fee fish themselves
pretty<00:01:51.060> much<00:01:51.240> any<00:01:51.509> fish<00:01:51.810> at<00:01:51.960> this<00:01:52.079> point<00:01:52.320> will

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.500 
pretty much any fish at this point will

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:54.530 
pretty much any fish at this point will
do<00:01:52.680> seeing<00:01:53.250> as<00:01:53.340> most<00:01:53.579> of<00:01:53.700> them<00:01:53.880> are<00:01:54.060> used

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:54.540 
do seeing as most of them are used

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:56.510 
do seeing as most of them are used
whiptail<00:01:55.320> i<00:01:55.619> would<00:01:55.740> probably<00:01:56.070> stay<00:01:56.250> away<00:01:56.460> from

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520 
whiptail i would probably stay away from

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:58.700 
whiptail i would probably stay away from
this<00:01:56.939> that's<00:01:57.180> the<00:01:57.390> stamina<00:01:57.960> food<00:01:58.200> and<00:01:58.469> it's

00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:58.710 
this that's the stamina food and it's

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:01.340 
this that's the stamina food and it's
only<00:01:59.040> at<00:01:59.159> 125<00:01:59.729> right<00:02:00.000> now<00:02:00.180> which<00:02:00.930> doesn't

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:01.350 
only at 125 right now which doesn't

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:02.870 
only at 125 right now which doesn't
really<00:02:01.500> make<00:02:01.740> sense<00:02:01.799> but<00:02:02.520> that<00:02:02.700> might<00:02:02.850> change

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:02.880 
really make sense but that might change

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:04.819 
really make sense but that might change
that<00:02:03.420> might<00:02:03.600> get<00:02:03.780> up<00:02:04.020> to<00:02:04.229> a<00:02:04.259> little<00:02:04.469> bit<00:02:04.560> so<00:02:04.740> it

00:02:04.819 --> 00:02:04.829 
that might get up to a little bit so it

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:07.100 
that might get up to a little bit so it
may<00:02:05.070> be<00:02:05.100> worth<00:02:05.369> it<00:02:05.610> but<00:02:06.180> crescent<00:02:06.659> saber<00:02:06.840> fish

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:07.110 
may be worth it but crescent saber fish

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:08.900 
may be worth it but crescent saber fish
is<00:02:07.259> used<00:02:07.469> in<00:02:07.649> all<00:02:07.770> of<00:02:07.920> these<00:02:08.069> recipes<00:02:08.399> so<00:02:08.759> i'll

profit you can get if you're into this

00:02:40.049 --> 00:02:42.379

and you don't really want to risk too

00:02:42.389 --> 00:02:44.360 
and you don't really want to risk too
much<00:02:42.599> but<00:02:43.379> I<00:02:43.560> will<00:02:43.680> be<00:02:43.799> spending<00:02:44.010> quite<00:02:44.219> a<00:02:44.310> bit

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:44.370 
much but I will be spending quite a bit

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:46.369 
much but I will be spending quite a bit
of<00:02:44.489> time<00:02:44.579> fishing<00:02:45.299> because<00:02:45.900> I<00:02:45.930> think<00:02:46.230> this<00:02:46.319> is

00:02:46.369 --> 00:02:46.379 
of time fishing because I think this is

00:02:46.379 --> 00:02:50.119 
of time fishing because I think this is
going<00:02:46.620> to<00:02:46.739> be<00:02:46.829> very<00:02:47.430> worthwhile<00:02:48.169> now<00:02:49.169> I<00:02:49.590> don't

00:02:50.119 --> 00:02:50.129 
going to be very worthwhile now I don't

00:02:50.129 --> 00:02:52.670 
going to be very worthwhile now I don't
really<00:02:50.370> see<00:02:50.519> them<00:02:50.969> bringing<00:02:51.209> out<00:02:51.419> a<00:02:51.449> feast<00:02:51.840> too

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:52.680 
really see them bringing out a feast too

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:54.920 
really see them bringing out a feast too
soon<00:02:53.099> and<00:02:53.459> I'm<00:02:53.909> wondering<00:02:54.150> what<00:02:54.629> would<00:02:54.780> even

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:54.930 
soon and I'm wondering what would even

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:56.780 
soon and I'm wondering what would even
be<00:02:55.049> in<00:02:55.290> that<00:02:55.469> feast<00:02:55.769> maybe<00:02:56.129> a<00:02:56.219> combination<00:02:56.400> of

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:56.790 
be in that feast maybe a combination of

00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:58.939 
be in that feast maybe a combination of
fish<00:02:57.030> and<00:02:57.239> meat<00:02:57.719> I'm<00:02:58.019> not<00:02:58.139> entirely<00:02:58.469> sure<00:02:58.620> but

00:02:58.939 --> 00:02:58.949 
fish and meat I'm not entirely sure but

00:02:58.949 --> 00:03:02.059 
fish and meat I'm not entirely sure but
if<00:02:59.099> we<00:02:59.189> do<00:02:59.310> get<00:02:59.459> a<00:02:59.519> 125<00:03:00.209> feast<00:03:01.019> then<00:03:01.859> that's

00:03:02.059 --> 00:03:02.069 
if we do get a 125 feast then that's

00:03:02.069 --> 00:03:04.069 
if we do get a 125 feast then that's
going<00:03:02.280> to<00:03:02.370> be<00:03:02.459> the<00:03:02.549> best<00:03:02.730> and<00:03:02.969> I<00:03:03.540> can't<00:03:03.930> really

00:03:04.069 --> 00:03:04.079 
going to be the best and I can't really

00:03:04.079 --> 00:03:06.530 
going to be the best and I can't really
see<00:03:04.379> them<00:03:04.500> changing<00:03:04.980> that<00:03:05.099> up<00:03:05.159> for<00:03:05.669> the<00:03:06.269> barn

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:06.540 
see them changing that up for the barn

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:08.300 
see them changing that up for the barn
with<00:03:07.019> the<00:03:07.049> savage<00:03:07.500> feast<00:03:07.739> because<00:03:08.010> then

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:08.310 
with the savage feast because then

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:10.490 
with the savage feast because then
savage<00:03:08.819> beast<00:03:09.060> would<00:03:09.299> simply<00:03:09.659> be<00:03:09.689> upgraded<00:03:10.379> I

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:10.500 
savage beast would simply be upgraded I

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:11.449 
savage beast would simply be upgraded I
don't<00:03:10.709> know<00:03:10.769> maybe<00:03:10.980> that's<00:03:11.159> going<00:03:11.340> to<00:03:11.400> be

00:03:11.449 --> 00:03:11.459 
don't know maybe that's going to be

00:03:11.459 --> 00:03:13.580 
don't know maybe that's going to be
something<00:03:11.579> to<00:03:11.909> do<00:03:12.030> with<00:03:12.239> catching<00:03:12.900> elite
