00:00:15.670 --> 00:00:22.090
 good morning, I'm joseph couchot, be 

00:00:18.850 --> 00:00:24.189
 strap and let's talk about how 

00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:25.460
 reduce or control the nerves in the 

00:00:24.189 --> 00:00:27.679
 tennis 

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:31.220
 being nervous in a tennis match 

00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:34.480
 it's perfectly normal before the same thing 

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:37.550
 important is to learn to control it or 

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:39.079
 reduce the each of the nerves that one 

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:42.170
 is feeling to be able to control 

00:00:39.079 --> 00:00:44.370
 better one's emotions 

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:47.100
 advice number 1 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:50.340
 the movement of feet when one moves 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:52.649
 The feet are active muscles 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:54.780
 tend to relax the mind tends to 

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:57.360
 relax too and that allows one 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:59.090
 relax also during the point and 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:01.190
 before the point 

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:03.800
 another very important thing between more 

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:05.660
 still one gets more nervous 

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:09.070
 can put why it is important to move 

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:13.790
 the feet it is important to stay active 

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:16.580
 important and keep everything that is the 

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:18.170
 constant body movement 

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:21.080
 movement we do not want us 

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:23.450
 we freeze on the court in half a match 

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:27.140
 second thing very important to reduce 

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:29.450
 the nerves in the game is to breathe 

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:32.140
 how many times are people playing 

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:34.540
 one match one point 

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:36.460
 and he is holding his breath not 

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:39.060
 we want to do that we want to make sure 

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:39.060
 to breathe 

00:01:39.409 --> 00:01:43.969
 while we are preparing for 

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:46.640
 return service and even when one 

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:48.170
 is going to serve or hit a hit you're going to 

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:51.740
 put you aside 

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:56.170
 you breathe loose breathing to be able 

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:56.170
 relax the same in the service 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:01.630
 and breathe out 

00:01:58.870 --> 00:02:04.500
 now the third thing that I would like 

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:08.009
 talking with you today is 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:10.259
 the rituals in many people who 

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:13.710
 have never heard what a ritual is a 

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:18.300
 ritual is certain things that one does 

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:21.440
 always before taking out or when sitting on 

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:23.790
 the chair or before returning service 

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:26.480
 these rituals are very important 

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:28.080
 because they allow the brain to work 

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:30.180
 automatically and not have to be 

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:33.000
 analyzing everything that one is 

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:35.100
 doing then an example of a 

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.600
 ritual for example of a ritual there 

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:40.150
 people who stop to return 

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:42.370
 service are put to tour the racket 

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:45.280
 this is a way to reduce stress 

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:47.140
 because one is doing a ritual a 

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:50.260
 movement an exercise that one does 

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:54.220
 always before returning service 

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:56.810
 serve when sitting while walking you will see 

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:59.550
 that many of the professionals 

00:02:56.810 --> 00:03:01.050
 tend to look at the ropes 

00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:03.570
 when they are looking at the ropes they are 

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:05.580
 thinking they are breathing but also 

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:07.710
 it's a ritual there are people who arrange 

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:10.020
 the ropes there are people who clean the 

00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:12.930
 sides of the racket there are people who 

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:15.780
 they just look at the racket there are other 

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:17.470
 people who catch before serving and 

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:20.380
 they fix a cap 

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:22.680
 or dribbling twice or dripping twenty 

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:25.600
 times before serving it all these are 

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:28.050
 rituals these rituals are going to 

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:28.050
 allow 

00:03:29.210 --> 00:03:34.460
 behave constantly in your 

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:38.150
 matches and that's going to reduce stress 

00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:38.150
 all that is 

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:43.180
 think too much before the game be 

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:45.510
 analyzing situations too much 

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:47.709
 have rhythms one will act 

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:51.760
 automatically and that makes things more 

00:03:47.709 --> 00:03:55.480
 easy for example when one is going to serve 

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:57.550
 It would be a good ritual and is very common throughout 

00:03:55.480 --> 00:04:01.340
 the world comes to the line flip the 

00:03:57.550 --> 00:04:04.209
 breathe ball 

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:07.459
 point to where one wants to take out 

00:04:04.209 --> 00:04:09.769
 throw the ball breathe out and 

00:04:07.459 --> 00:04:12.950
 finishing the service is a common ritual 

00:04:09.769 --> 00:04:15.830
 the service itself is a ritual then 

00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:17.660
 everyone has a particular ritual that 

00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:19.760
 particular ritual do you have that you 

00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:21.209
 find it in your game and put it in 

00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:25.310
 practice 

00:04:21.209 --> 00:04:25.310
 thank you until next time
