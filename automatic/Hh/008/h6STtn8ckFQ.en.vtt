00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:04.190
 so should be new lamps by Gaby Eggert 

00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:07.890
 that can only be imagined 

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:09.849
 make special 

00:00:09.849 --> 00:00:12.769
 he would have to 

00:00:12.769 --> 00:00:15.379
 the Alliance 

00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:18.690
 because it's called neither Medici Everyday Terrines 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:21.029
 that's all 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:24.029
 you can stay there every day as it is 

00:00:25.899 --> 00:00:27.480
 that the 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:28.859
 in your pocket 

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:31.859
 I suppose he did 

00:00:32.440 --> 00:00:34.080
 so 

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:37.080
 Werne the new is the DLRG 

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:43.670
 The man did not go up, not all the other bands 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:48.810
 we are therefore brighter 

00:00:48.810 --> 00:00:51.810
 after the open switch 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:57.210
 She can be operated with one after one in one 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:00.870
 I am a Nazi 1 sentence 3 AktG 

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:06.720
 or with revenue from that he wanted to pause further to the high court 

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:13.600
 or even Obermann's apartment 5 volts with my brothers will be playing day 

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:15.410
 one point 

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:18.410
 the included 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:22.080
 defeated the provided extension 

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:24.479
 the reasons are 

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:26.170
 as the original 

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:28.390
 after stop 

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:31.010
 and the extension for the 

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:35.020
 with Markus HÃ¤ring dog-friendly manual 

00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:37.340
 of course on Anish 

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:39.410
 but too much 

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:42.410
 do not need because on the stomach 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:49.619
 The Langenberger take care that he was once but did not say yet 

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:52.910
 has its traces 

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:57.710
 She has an on-site walk-through reported by turning the various ones 

00:01:57.710 --> 00:02:00.710
 Steps sat longer than one the customer 

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:04.970
 store the light, pour it lowest level 

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:06.640
 I want to help my children 

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:09.649
 the last track 

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:11.739
 the third track 

00:02:11.739 --> 00:02:13.239
 highest step 

00:02:13.239 --> 00:02:15.799
 with loud cheers 

00:02:15.799 --> 00:02:17.209
 briefly uprooted 

00:02:17.209 --> 00:02:20.209
 30 o'clock 

00:02:20.709 --> 00:02:23.709
 8 percent 

00:02:24.819 --> 00:02:27.929
 Group first does that 

00:02:27.929 --> 00:02:29.319
 Prof 

00:02:29.319 --> 00:02:32.189
 Dr 

00:02:32.189 --> 00:02:34.229
 only Thomas Tuchel 

00:02:34.229 --> 00:02:36.079
 is 

00:02:36.079 --> 00:02:38.189
 as number 18 

00:02:38.189 --> 00:02:40.709
 that's 100 dead 

00:02:40.709 --> 00:02:42.920
 that in the production abroad 

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:46.029
 the stock exchanges in Hong Kong and Shenzhen 

00:02:46.029 --> 00:02:48.609
 easy to use and introduction of Straumann 

00:02:48.609 --> 00:02:51.609
 processed very well 

00:02:53.689 --> 00:02:56.479
 and everybody goes about it 

00:02:56.479 --> 00:02:59.679
 whose problems at Tobit David Rosenblum polish 

00:03:01.999 --> 00:03:04.650
 to be the war in the morning
