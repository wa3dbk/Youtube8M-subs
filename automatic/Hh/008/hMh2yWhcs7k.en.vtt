00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.390
 yes yes 

00:00:05.710 --> 00:00:10.030
 hello friends welcome to a new 

00:00:07.630 --> 00:00:12.910
 cutting program and correction channel 

00:00:10.030 --> 00:00:16.689
 today we continue talking about how 

00:00:12.910 --> 00:00:19.650
 enrich our stories are often 

00:00:16.689 --> 00:00:22.960
 come to the workshop a lot of stories that 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:25.689
 pose situations really very 

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:27.910
 interesting at the beginning or very basic 

00:00:25.689 --> 00:00:31.809
 but then they get better but 

00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:34.090
 there is a characteristic that affects the 

00:00:31.809 --> 00:00:37.420
 most of the stories are 

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:39.820
 predictable one more are predictable or 

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:42.309
 less will watching for where they shoot the 

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:47.050
 things is that of stealing 

00:00:42.309 --> 00:00:50.019
 yours and they fished him or also robbery whose and 

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:53.559
 I can not fish it's say there are things 

00:00:50.019 --> 00:00:55.809
 that one is waiting for them to 

00:00:53.559 --> 00:00:59.230
 the characters the grace is 

00:00:55.809 --> 00:01:01.929
 precisely in achieving was in that story 

00:00:59.230 --> 00:01:03.960
 paradoxical component that paradox that 

00:01:01.929 --> 00:01:06.410
 makes things go to a place 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:10.490
 completely 

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:15.600
 undetermined by the suspicions more 

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:18.270
 suspicious of the reader how to do that 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:20.360
 well look really what to see in each 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:23.250
 case what is in our hands 

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:28.280
 but I remember something wonderful that 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:28.280
 he said 'he did not say once he said 

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:34.700
 when a man goes to monte carlo and makes 

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:38.240
 jump the bench when the roulette 

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:42.469
 He returns home and cheerfully 

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:44.959
 he spends his income squandering for all the 

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:46.240
 homeland is not fucked either there is no 

00:01:44.959 --> 00:01:48.790
 story 

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:52.060
 when the story came from if there is a story 

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:55.390
 When a man goes to Monte Carlo he does 

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:58.780
 jump the bench returns to his house and he 

00:01:55.390 --> 00:02:02.110
 productive there is the thing there is the 

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:04.630
 thing is something that the viewer in the 

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:07.450
 case of the cinema or the reader in the case of 

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:10.479
 the novel or the story are not waiting 

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:14.120
 you will remember me did help me 

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:18.290
 producer to show you this book 

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:21.100
 can this be called rod taylor 3 

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:24.250
 a zoom by the ico 

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:26.970
 with taylor in which teach the movie 

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:30.070
 birds this great wonderful movie 

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:34.360
 at the beginning of the movie we see it to 

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:38.110
 rod taylor playing him a little bird come 

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:39.820
 as he is tormenting him by compiling 

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:42.640
 in the through the cage of the 

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:45.010
 bars but look forward the 

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:46.630
 movie what can get to achieve a 

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:49.550
 grand master narration as was the fat 

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:52.650
 look 

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:55.489
 at the end of the movie 

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:59.280
 a little bird is playing with rod taylor 

00:02:55.489 --> 00:03:01.950
 What the issue costs me is how to achieve 

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:05.790
 how to make that happen 

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:08.670
 helicoid that leads from this plane to this 

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:11.040
 another one that was in the middle so that 

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:13.799
 things have changed so much good there 

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:17.340
 is each one going to be seeing in his 

00:03:13.799 --> 00:03:20.189
 narration how to achieve that but a 

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:22.769
 relationship can not end as there was 

00:03:20.189 --> 00:03:25.790
 started there are changes that are being made 

00:03:22.769 --> 00:03:28.260
 throughout the whole narrative process 

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:30.480
 remember if a man roa montecarlo and 

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:32.459
 he makes the bank jump he returns to his house and 

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:34.019
 enjoy your income there is no history 

00:03:32.459 --> 00:03:37.590
 is precisely what the viewer 

00:03:34.019 --> 00:03:39.510
 is waiting but if a man goes back to 

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:41.760
 your home after you have won the 

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:43.680
 Roulette is shot and also that the 

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:45.510
 Silver does not make anyone's happiness but 

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:47.760
 that calms the nerves enough not 

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:51.030
 whatever happened so that this 

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:53.129
 sir decide precisely to remove the 

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:55.620
 life that's a mystery and we're going to 

00:03:53.129 --> 00:03:57.660
 try to go revealing the programs 

00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:59.100
 problems in this that is being cut 

00:03:57.660 --> 00:04:00.720
