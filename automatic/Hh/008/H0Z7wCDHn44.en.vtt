00:00:00.333 --> 00:00:02.800
- TELL ME A TYPICAL DAY IN--

00:00:02.800 --> 00:00:03.933
- IN GEORGE CLOONEY'S LIFE?

00:00:03.933 --> 00:00:05.166
- YES, YES.

00:00:05.166 --> 00:00:06.733
NO, LET'S START WITH YOUR LIFE.
- OKAY.

00:00:06.733 --> 00:00:09.833
- SO YOU HAVE--HOW MANY--
FIVE CHILDREN?

00:00:09.833 --> 00:00:10.933
HOW MANY DO YOU HAVE?

00:00:10.933 --> 00:00:11.966
- SOMETIMES IT FEELS LIKE FIVE.
- YOU HAVE THREE.

00:00:11.966 --> 00:00:13.200
YOU HAVE TWINS...
- ONLY THREE.

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:14.200
I HAVE THREE, YES.

00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:17.333
- TWINS AND THEN A CHILD
ON ITS OWN.

00:00:17.333 --> 00:00:18.800
[laughter]

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:21.800
HOW OLD ARE ALL OF THEM?

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:25.033
- THERE SEEMS TO BE
SOME CONFUSION.

00:00:25.033 --> 00:00:29.066
WELL, ACTUALLY, HENRY,
OUR YOUNGEST, WHO IS SIX,

00:00:29.066 --> 00:00:32.733
HE SAYS THAT HE AND HIS BROTHER
AND SISTER, HAZEL AND FINN,

00:00:32.733 --> 00:00:35.166
THAT THEY'RE THREE TWINS.

00:00:35.166 --> 00:00:37.133
- MM-HMM,
SO HE'S NOT SMART.

00:00:37.133 --> 00:00:39.733
[laughter]

00:00:39.733 --> 00:00:41.000
- IT'S NOT ABOUT INTELLECT.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:42.500
IT'S ABOUT HEART.

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:44.366
- HE'S CHARMING.

00:00:44.366 --> 00:00:46.100
- NO, HE FEELS
THAT THEY ARE SO CLOSE

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:47.633
THAT THEY ARE ACTUALLY--
WHEN PEOPLE TALK ABOUT

00:00:47.633 --> 00:00:49.333
THAT WE HAVE TWINS
IN OUR FAMILY,

00:00:49.333 --> 00:00:51.400
HE THINKS THAT THE THREE OF THEM
ARE THE TWINS.

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:52.600
- YEAH.

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:53.600
- HE'S AN IDIOT.

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:55.033
- YEAH, YEAH, YEAH, NO.

00:00:55.033 --> 00:00:56.033
- SEE?

00:00:56.033 --> 00:00:57.666
OH, I SAY IT,
AND EVERYONE TURNS AGAINST ME.

00:00:57.666 --> 00:00:58.666
HE'S MY CHILD.

00:00:58.666 --> 00:01:00.300
- HE'S YOUR CHILD.
YOU SHOULD DEFEND HIM.

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:02.566
BUT I CAN...

00:01:02.566 --> 00:01:04.800
NO, I THINK THAT'S--
'CAUSE IT MUST BE--

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:06.733
IT MUST BE HARD FOR HIM
TO HEAR EVERYBODY, LIKE,

00:01:06.733 --> 00:01:08.466
TALK ABOUT TWINS AND GIVE THEM
A LOT OF ATTENTION.

00:01:08.466 --> 00:01:10.600
- BUT NOBODY REALLY SAYS
"TWINS."

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:11.666
- MM-HMM.

00:01:11.666 --> 00:01:13.800
UM...

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:15.400
[laughter]

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:17.366
SORRY, I JUST FELL ASLEEP
FOR A SECOND--

00:01:17.366 --> 00:01:18.633
- WHERE DID YOU GO?

00:01:18.633 --> 00:01:20.433
[laughter]

00:01:20.433 --> 00:01:22.500
[snores]

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:23.500
DO YOU EVER SCARE THEM?

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:24.800
DO YOU SCARE YOUR CHILDREN?

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:26.166
- ALL RIGHT, WELL,
HERE'S THE THING.

00:01:26.166 --> 00:01:29.000
AS MUCH AS I DO NOT LIKE
TO BE SCARED,

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.866
HOW MANY MOMS HERE HAVE EVER
SCARED YOUR CHILD,

00:01:31.866 --> 00:01:36.933
AND THEY ARE SO EASILY SCARED,

00:01:36.933 --> 00:01:39.900
AND THEN YOU GET THE FEVER
FOR IT?

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:41.266
[laughter]

00:01:41.266 --> 00:01:43.233
- SOMEONE HERE IS SAYING YES,
SHE HAS SCARED HER CHILD.

00:01:43.233 --> 00:01:44.233
- YEAH, RIGHT?

00:01:44.233 --> 00:01:45.800
AND, I MEAN,
JUST A COUPLE OF WEEKS AGO--

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:48.066
AND I HAD TO STOP MYSELF,
'CAUSE I REALIZED THIS IS--

00:01:48.066 --> 00:01:52.100
THERE'S SOMETHING DISTURBING OR,
LIKE,

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:56.366
POTENTIALLY ABUSIVE
AND LONG-LASTING.

00:01:56.366 --> 00:01:58.400
BUT THE OTHER WEEK,

00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:01.900
THERE WAS JUST SUCH
A GOLDEN OPPORTUNITY.

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:03.800
I WAS COMING DOWN THE STAIRS,

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:06.233
AND MY OLDEST SON
WAS COMING DOWN THE HALL...

00:02:06.233 --> 00:02:09.733
[laughs]

00:02:09.733 --> 00:02:10.766
IT'S SO WRONG.

00:02:10.766 --> 00:02:14.400
THIS PROVES ABSOLUTELY
I DON'T GO OUT ENOUGH AT ALL,

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:18.233
BECAUSE WHEN HE CAME AROUND,
I JUST JUMPED DOWN AND SAID,

00:02:18.233 --> 00:02:21.733
"BOO," AND HE SPRUNG OUT

00:02:21.733 --> 00:02:25.066
HIS LEGS AND HIS ARMS
AND WENT UP

00:02:25.066 --> 00:02:29.300
AND OBVIOUSLY SCARED THE BEJESUS
OUT OF HIM.

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:30.300
- WAIT, SO HIS--

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:31.966
- I CAN'T STOP LAUGHING.

00:02:31.966 --> 00:02:34.500
- WELL, OF COURSE,
THE WAY YOU DESCRIBE IT--

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:35.900
LIKE A CARTOON,
LIKE, HIS LEGS AND--

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:37.333
- WHOO-WHOO.
- YEAH.

00:02:37.333 --> 00:02:38.466
THEN YOU'RE GONNA WANT
TO DO THAT AGAIN.

00:02:38.466 --> 00:02:39.800
WHY NOT?

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:41.000
- YOU HAVE TO STOP YOURSELF,
THOUGH.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.133
- YEAH, NO.
- YOU HAVE TO STOP YOURSELF.

00:02:43.133 --> 00:02:45.233
BECAUSE YOU'RE THE PARENT.

00:02:45.233 --> 00:02:46.400
- YEAH, YEAH.

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:49.500
[laughter]

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:52.433
- BUT YOU GUYS KNOW
WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT.

00:02:52.433 --> 00:02:53.433
OH, IT'S FUNNY.

00:02:53.433 --> 00:02:54.933
WOW, I AM JUST WATERWORKS HERE.

00:02:54.933 --> 00:02:56.366
- YEAH.

00:02:56.366 --> 00:02:58.333
HOW MUCH DRINKING
DO YOU DO ALONE?

00:02:58.333 --> 00:02:59.900
[laughter]
