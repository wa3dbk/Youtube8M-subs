00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:33.810 

pretty<00:00:29.080> much<00:00:29.910> curating<00:00:30.910> and<00:00:32.670> doing<00:00:33.670> the

taking<00:00:38.410> the<00:00:38.590> blame<00:00:38.770> when<00:00:39.130> everything<00:00:39.550> goes

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:39.670 
taking the blame when everything goes

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:46.110 
taking the blame when everything goes
wrong<00:00:39.940> I<00:00:40.210> guess<00:00:40.420> I<00:00:44.760> described<00:00:45.760> that<00:00:45.790> it's

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:46.120 
wrong I guess I described that it's

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:48.869 
wrong I guess I described that it's
probably<00:00:46.390> a<00:00:46.660> sort<00:00:47.290> of<00:00:47.320> a<00:00:47.440> new<00:00:47.860> genre<00:00:47.890> of<00:00:48.460> music

00:00:48.869 --> 00:00:48.879 
probably a sort of a new genre of music

00:00:48.879 --> 00:00:52.770 
probably a sort of a new genre of music
because<00:00:50.070> most<00:00:51.070> my<00:00:51.340> my<00:00:51.940> colleagues<00:00:52.360> and<00:00:52.510> I<00:00:52.570> we

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:52.780 
because most my my colleagues and I we

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:55.259 
because most my my colleagues and I we
we<00:00:53.260> you<00:00:53.620> know<00:00:53.739> from<00:00:53.949> a<00:00:53.980> so-called<00:00:54.670> classical

00:00:55.259 --> 00:00:55.269 
we you know from a so-called classical

00:00:55.269 --> 00:00:59.069 
we you know from a so-called classical
Orchestra<00:00:55.900> but<00:00:57.390> having<00:00:58.390> said<00:00:58.570> that<00:00:58.630> we

00:00:59.069 --> 00:00:59.079 
Orchestra but having said that we

00:00:59.079 --> 00:01:02.520 
Orchestra but having said that we
actually<00:00:59.920> play<00:01:00.489> so<00:01:00.760> many<00:01:00.880> different<00:01:01.420> types<00:01:02.350> of

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:02.530 
actually play so many different types of

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:03.180 
actually play so many different types of
music

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:03.190 
music

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:05.670 
music
within<00:01:04.119> the<00:01:04.270> classical<00:01:04.600> Munich<00:01:04.960> your<00:01:05.290> music

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:05.680 
within the classical Munich your music

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:08.550 
within the classical Munich your music
alone<00:01:05.950> and<00:01:06.759> then<00:01:06.970> we<00:01:07.149> we<00:01:07.720> also<00:01:07.899> play<00:01:08.200> a<00:01:08.229> lot<00:01:08.440> of

00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:08.560 
alone and then we we also play a lot of

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:11.190 
alone and then we we also play a lot of
non<00:01:08.920> classical<00:01:09.100> music<00:01:09.759> so<00:01:09.940> I<00:01:10.149> think<00:01:10.450> it's<00:01:10.720> gone

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:11.200 
non classical music so I think it's gone

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:13.830 
non classical music so I think it's gone
very<00:01:11.619> blurred<00:01:12.190> we<00:01:12.759> don't<00:01:12.940> anymore<00:01:13.180> talk<00:01:13.509> about

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:13.840 
very blurred we don't anymore talk about

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:16.770 
very blurred we don't anymore talk about
classical<00:01:14.350> music<00:01:14.410> or<00:01:15.100> rock<00:01:15.670> music<00:01:15.729> oh<00:01:16.420> wait

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:16.780 
classical music or rock music oh wait

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:20.580 
classical music or rock music oh wait
it's<00:01:16.990> it's<00:01:17.259> more<00:01:18.780> it's<00:01:19.780> it's<00:01:20.050> more<00:01:20.289> of<00:01:20.470> a

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:20.590 
it's it's more it's it's more of a

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:23.310 
it's it's more it's it's more of a
concept<00:01:21.160> of<00:01:21.399> what<00:01:22.149> kind<00:01:22.420> of<00:01:22.479> music<00:01:22.630> goes<00:01:23.050> well

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:23.320 
concept of what kind of music goes well

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:26.040 
concept of what kind of music goes well
together<00:01:23.560> and<00:01:24.039> so<00:01:24.820> I<00:01:25.210> think<00:01:25.300> anyone<00:01:25.840> who'd

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:26.050 
together and so I think anyone who'd

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:28.889 
together and so I think anyone who'd
come<00:01:26.320> along<00:01:27.070> would<00:01:27.280> be<00:01:27.430> quite<00:01:27.700> surprised<00:01:28.360> at

00:01:28.889 --> 00:01:28.899 
come along would be quite surprised at

00:01:28.899 --> 00:01:33.210 
come along would be quite surprised at
at<00:01:29.880> what<00:01:30.880> they<00:01:31.060> hear<00:01:31.509> because<00:01:32.410> we<00:01:32.590> put<00:01:33.009> for

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:33.220 
at what they hear because we put for

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:36.719 
at what they hear because we put for
example<00:01:33.509> we<00:01:34.509> both<00:01:34.750> put<00:01:35.170> so<00:01:36.069> four<00:01:36.280> classical

00:01:36.719 --> 00:01:36.729 
example we both put so four classical

00:01:36.729 --> 00:01:39.080 
example we both put so four classical
composers<00:01:37.330> like<00:01:37.360> Shostakovich<00:01:38.319> and<00:01:38.500> bourbon

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090 
composers like Shostakovich and bourbon

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:43.139 
composers like Shostakovich and bourbon
makes<00:01:40.090> two<00:01:40.500> grunge<00:01:41.500> music<00:01:42.009> because<00:01:42.940> the

00:01:43.139 --> 00:01:43.149 
makes two grunge music because the

00:01:43.149 --> 00:01:45.150 
makes two grunge music because the
sentiment<00:01:43.569> I<00:01:43.840> think<00:01:44.080> is<00:01:44.229> similar<00:01:44.770> you<00:01:44.950> know

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:45.160 
sentiment I think is similar you know

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:47.850 
sentiment I think is similar you know
you<00:01:45.220> have<00:01:45.520> the<00:01:45.670> same<00:01:46.030> sort<00:01:46.479> of<00:01:46.599> psychic<00:01:47.530> terror

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:47.860 
you have the same sort of psychic terror

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:52.350 
you have the same sort of psychic terror
you<00:01:48.580> know<00:01:48.700> feel<00:01:49.030> to<00:01:49.270> it<00:01:49.390> or<00:01:50.140> we<00:01:50.649> put<00:01:50.920> or<00:01:51.640> we<00:01:52.090> have

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:52.360 
you know feel to it or we put or we have

music<00:02:41.000> that<00:02:41.090> we<00:02:41.210> played<00:02:41.450> that<00:02:41.660> you<00:02:41.840> sort<00:02:42.080> of

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:42.110 
music that we played that you sort of

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:44.110 
music that we played that you sort of
start<00:02:42.440> putting<00:02:42.830> things<00:02:43.100> together<00:02:43.340> this<00:02:43.850> goes

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:44.120 
start putting things together this goes

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:45.880 
start putting things together this goes
well<00:02:44.390> with<00:02:44.570> this<00:02:44.780> is<00:02:45.050> goes<00:02:45.290> well<00:02:45.530> with<00:02:45.680> this

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:45.890 
well with this is goes well with this

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:48.250 
well with this is goes well with this
and<00:02:46.250> oh<00:02:46.400> this<00:02:46.820> is<00:02:47.000> a<00:02:47.030> nice<00:02:47.300> contrast<00:02:47.960> to<00:02:48.140> the

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:48.260 
and oh this is a nice contrast to the

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:52.960 
and oh this is a nice contrast to the
other<00:02:48.500> thing<00:02:48.860> and<00:02:50.560> so<00:02:51.610> that's<00:02:52.610> pretty<00:02:52.850> much

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:52.970 
other thing and so that's pretty much

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:55.210 
other thing and so that's pretty much
you<00:02:53.540> know<00:02:53.660> how<00:02:53.990> it<00:02:54.170> and<00:02:54.410> then<00:02:54.890> you<00:02:55.010> have<00:02:55.190> a

00:02:55.210 --> 00:02:55.220 
you know how it and then you have a

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:56.470 
you know how it and then you have a
deadline<00:02:55.610> and<00:02:55.820> then<00:02:55.970> you<00:02:56.060> have<00:02:56.210> to<00:02:56.330> have

00:02:56.470 --> 00:02:56.480 
deadline and then you have to have

00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:58.810 
deadline and then you have to have
