00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:26.009 
nice things are humming bird have always

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:28.640 
nice things are humming bird have always
done<00:01:26.400> for<00:01:26.430> quite<00:01:26.939> a<00:01:27.000> while<00:01:27.240> now<00:01:27.299> is<00:01:27.810> kept<00:01:28.500> the

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650 
done for quite a while now is kept the

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:31.880 
done for quite a while now is kept the
buttons<00:01:29.100> pretty<00:01:29.729> much<00:01:29.939> one<00:01:30.479> function<00:01:31.020> simple

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890 
buttons pretty much one function simple

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:32.450 
buttons pretty much one function simple
operation

operation

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:34.760

so<00:01:32.909> each<00:01:33.329> button<00:01:33.840> has<00:01:33.869> pretty<00:01:34.320> much<00:01:34.409> this<00:01:34.590> one

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770 
so each button has pretty much this one

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:37.670 
so each button has pretty much this one
function<00:01:35.009> so<00:01:35.790> menus<00:01:36.329> just<00:01:36.840> a<00:01:36.930> menu<00:01:37.110> button<00:01:37.409> is

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:37.680 
function so menus just a menu button is

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:40.780 
function so menus just a menu button is
its<00:01:37.950> to<00:01:38.130> exit<00:01:38.549> mark<00:01:39.390> is<00:01:39.600> to<00:01:39.750> save<00:01:39.960> a<00:01:39.990> waypoint

pretty<00:01:51.000> simple<00:01:52.070> it's<00:01:53.070> a<00:01:53.220> smaller<00:01:54.060> screen<00:01:54.540> than

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:54.720 
pretty simple it's a smaller screen than

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:56.899 
pretty simple it's a smaller screen than
its<00:01:54.840> bigger<00:01:55.079> brother<00:01:55.380> the<00:01:55.470> 600<00:01:56.310> series<00:01:56.670> in

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:56.909 
its bigger brother the 600 series in

00:01:56.909 --> 00:01:58.639 
its bigger brother the 600 series in

bit<00:02:01.530> easier<00:02:01.860> to<00:02:01.890> use<00:02:02.180> so<00:02:03.180> if<00:02:03.240> we<00:02:03.360> just<00:02:03.540> cruise

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:03.780 
bit easier to use so if we just cruise

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:11.490 
bit easier to use so if we just cruise
on<00:02:03.990> through<00:02:04.259> here
