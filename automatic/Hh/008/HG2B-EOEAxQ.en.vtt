00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:45.270 
because he doesn't go over that either

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:47.300 
because he doesn't go over that either
but<00:01:45.840> you<00:01:46.110> know<00:01:46.500> pretty<00:01:46.710> standard<00:01:47.130> supply

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:47.310 
but you know pretty standard supply

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:49.039 
but you know pretty standard supply
depot<00:01:47.700> timings<00:01:48.090> you<00:01:48.210> so<00:01:48.360> that<00:01:48.540> you<00:01:48.630> don't<00:01:48.810> get

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:49.049 
depot timings you so that you don't get

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:51.050 
depot timings you so that you don't get
supply<00:01:49.439> capped<00:01:49.799> something<00:01:50.700> you<00:01:50.759> didn't<00:01:50.970> hear

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:51.060 
supply capped something you didn't hear

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:53.480 
supply capped something you didn't hear
that<00:01:51.090> like<00:01:51.360> 15<00:01:51.810> or<00:01:51.840> 16<00:01:52.220> you<00:01:53.220> know<00:01:53.280> and<00:01:53.399> then

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:53.490 
that like 15 or 16 you know and then

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:55.969 
that like 15 or 16 you know and then
probably<00:01:53.700> again<00:01:53.970> it<00:01:54.060> like<00:01:54.180> 23<00:01:54.720> so<00:01:55.619> he's<00:01:55.860> got

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:55.979 
probably again it like 23 so he's got

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:58.249 
probably again it like 23 so he's got
100<00:01:56.310> gas<00:01:56.460> uses<00:01:57.119> it<00:01:57.240> first<00:01:57.420> factory<00:01:57.869> and<00:01:58.140> then

00:01:58.249 --> 00:01:58.259 
100 gas uses it first factory and then

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:00.020 
100 gas uses it first factory and then
I'm<00:01:58.350> going<00:01:58.439> to<00:01:58.500> fast<00:01:58.740> forward<00:01:58.829> this<00:01:59.189> and<00:01:59.460> you

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:00.030 
I'm going to fast forward this and you

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:02.389 
I'm going to fast forward this and you
know<00:02:00.119> just<00:02:00.149> keep<00:02:00.509> pumping<00:02:00.689> SUVs<00:02:01.290> and<00:02:01.590> keep

00:02:02.389 --> 00:02:02.399 
know just keep pumping SUVs and keep

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:05.510 
know just keep pumping SUVs and keep
pumping<00:02:02.759> some<00:02:03.149> marines<00:02:03.570> and<00:02:03.930> he<00:02:04.500> says<00:02:04.710> one<00:02:05.430> of

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520 
pumping some marines and he says one of

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:07.280 
pumping some marines and he says one of
the<00:02:05.579> weaknesses<00:02:05.759> of<00:02:06.090> this<00:02:06.299> build<00:02:06.600> is<00:02:06.840> that

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:07.290 
the weaknesses of this build is that

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:09.229 
the weaknesses of this build is that
there<00:02:07.590> can<00:02:07.799> be<00:02:07.829> early<00:02:08.220> proxy<00:02:08.640> rax<00:02:08.759> because<00:02:09.149> you

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:09.239 
there can be early proxy rax because you

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:10.490 
there can be early proxy rax because you
can<00:02:09.360> see<00:02:09.509> you<00:02:09.599> only<00:02:09.780> have<00:02:09.989> one<00:02:10.170> barracks

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:10.500 
can see you only have one barracks

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:12.110 
can see you only have one barracks
you're<00:02:11.039> going<00:02:11.160> to<00:02:11.220> get<00:02:11.280> that<00:02:11.430> reactor<00:02:11.849> early

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:12.120 
you're going to get that reactor early

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:12.570 
you're going to get that reactor early
or<00:02:12.239> not

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:12.580 
or not

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:14.610 
or not
that<00:02:12.760> may<00:02:12.940> Marines<00:02:13.300> so<00:02:13.990> you<00:02:14.050> got<00:02:14.230> to<00:02:14.320> watch<00:02:14.440> out

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:14.620 
that may Marines so you got to watch out

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:16.620 
that may Marines so you got to watch out
for<00:02:14.680> that<00:02:14.860> and<00:02:15.190> then<00:02:15.700> if<00:02:16.210> they<00:02:16.480> get

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:16.630 
for that and then if they get

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:19.290 
for that and then if they get
pre-emptive<00:02:17.200> Vikings<00:02:17.770> or<00:02:18.040> siege<00:02:18.490> mode<00:02:18.790> he

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:19.300 
pre-emptive Vikings or siege mode he

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:20.880 
pre-emptive Vikings or siege mode he
says<00:02:19.540> that<00:02:19.750> also<00:02:20.080> hurts<00:02:20.290> this<00:02:20.410> because<00:02:20.740> this

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:20.890 
says that also hurts this because this

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:23.010 
says that also hurts this because this
is<00:02:21.040> a<00:02:21.070> timing<00:02:21.430> push<00:02:21.820> so<00:02:22.090> your<00:02:22.600> goal<00:02:22.810> is<00:02:22.990> to

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:23.020 
is a timing push so your goal is to

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:25.320 
is a timing push so your goal is to
optimize<00:02:23.650> your<00:02:24.130> army<00:02:24.670> at<00:02:24.880> around<00:02:25.180> the

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:25.330 
optimize your army at around the

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:27.570 
optimize your army at around the
7-minute<00:02:25.930> mark<00:02:26.080> and<00:02:26.350> then<00:02:26.530> push<00:02:26.710> out<00:02:26.920> so<00:02:27.460> let's

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:27.580 
7-minute mark and then push out so let's

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:30.450 
7-minute mark and then push out so let's
get<00:02:27.670> back<00:02:27.850> into<00:02:28.030> this<00:02:28.150> build<00:02:29.010> so<00:02:30.010> he<00:02:30.070> makes<00:02:30.250> his

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:30.460 
get back into this build so he makes his

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:33.000 
get back into this build so he makes his
a<00:02:30.490> factory<00:02:31.150> when<00:02:31.300> he<00:02:31.360> has<00:02:31.480> a<00:02:31.510> hundred<00:02:32.010> minerals

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:33.010 
a factory when he has a hundred minerals

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:36.390 
a factory when he has a hundred minerals
or<00:02:33.640> 100<00:02:33.970> gas<00:02:34.150> and<00:02:34.480> then<00:02:34.660> he<00:02:34.900> gets<00:02:35.160> when<00:02:36.160> he<00:02:36.250> gets

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:36.400 
or 100 gas and then he gets when he gets

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:38.880 
or 100 gas and then he gets when he gets
his<00:02:36.520> next<00:02:36.790> 50<00:02:37.060> gas<00:02:37.270> he<00:02:37.540> gets<00:02:37.750> a<00:02:37.900> he<00:02:38.590> gets<00:02:38.740> a

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:38.890 
his next 50 gas he gets a he gets a

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:40.800 
his next 50 gas he gets a he gets a
check<00:02:39.190> cut<00:02:39.430> I'm<00:02:39.580> not<00:02:39.730> a<00:02:39.790> tech<00:02:40.030> lab<00:02:40.210> a<00:02:40.240> reactor

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:40.810 
check cut I'm not a tech lab a reactor

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:45.240 
check cut I'm not a tech lab a reactor
on<00:02:40.990> his<00:02:41.760> barracks<00:02:42.760> and<00:02:43.000> then<00:02:43.600> he<00:02:44.380> gets<00:02:44.530> a<00:02:44.740> star

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:45.250 
on his barracks and then he gets a star

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:47.370 
on his barracks and then he gets a star
port<00:02:45.550> and<00:02:45.730> he<00:02:45.790> gets<00:02:45.940> a<00:02:46.030> tech<00:02:46.270> lab<00:02:46.480> on<00:02:46.720> his<00:02:47.020> tank

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:47.380 
port and he gets a tech lab on his tank

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:49.530 
port and he gets a tech lab on his tank
while<00:02:48.310> he's<00:02:48.460> getting<00:02:48.580> that<00:02:48.820> star<00:02:49.090> port<00:02:49.360> for

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:49.540 
while he's getting that star port for

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:51.000 
while he's getting that star port for
tech<00:02:49.840> live<00:02:49.990> on<00:02:50.140> his<00:02:50.260> tank<00:02:50.470> on<00:02:50.590> his<00:02:50.709> factory

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:51.010 
tech live on his tank on his factory

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:52.110 
tech live on his tank on his factory
while<00:02:51.160> he's<00:02:51.280> getting<00:02:51.370> that<00:02:51.550> starboard<00:02:51.940> and

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:52.120 
while he's getting that starboard and

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:53.910 
while he's getting that starboard and
then<00:02:52.660> he<00:02:52.750> just<00:02:52.780> continues<00:02:53.410> from<00:02:53.530> there<00:02:53.709> to

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:53.920 
then he just continues from there to

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:58.020 
then he just continues from there to
mass<00:02:54.580> tanks<00:02:55.180> and<00:02:55.740> banshees<00:02:56.740> so<00:02:57.400> just<00:02:57.820> straight

00:02:58.020 --> 00:02:58.030 
mass tanks and banshees so just straight

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:00.210 
mass tanks and banshees so just straight
tanks<00:02:58.390> and<00:02:58.570> banshees<00:02:59.140> for<00:02:59.320> this<00:02:59.440> build<00:02:59.650> then

00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:00.220 
tanks and banshees for this build then

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:02.490 
tanks and banshees for this build then
let's<00:03:00.400> fast-forward<00:03:00.760> it<00:03:01.090> if<00:03:02.080> you<00:03:02.200> guys<00:03:02.290> really

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:02.500 
let's fast-forward it if you guys really

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:04.230 
let's fast-forward it if you guys really
want<00:03:02.650> to<00:03:02.890> read<00:03:03.370> the<00:03:03.490> build<00:03:03.670> you<00:03:03.850> can<00:03:03.940> go<00:03:04.030> to<00:03:04.090> his

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:04.240 
want to read the build you can go to his

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:05.550 
want to read the build you can go to his
website<00:03:04.270> and<00:03:04.810> review<00:03:05.140> it<00:03:05.170> on<00:03:05.320> the<00:03:05.410> right

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:05.560 
website and review it on the right

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:08.160 
website and review it on the right
there's<00:03:06.280> a<00:03:06.340> link<00:03:06.520> down<00:03:06.700> there<00:03:07.030> somewhere<00:03:07.420> for

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:08.170 
there's a link down there somewhere for

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:10.290 
there's a link down there somewhere for
his<00:03:08.290> websites<00:03:08.740> look<00:03:08.980> for<00:03:09.190> that<00:03:09.310> so<00:03:10.000> here<00:03:10.209> he

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:10.300 
his websites look for that so here he

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:12.900 
his websites look for that so here he
goes<00:03:10.480> it's<00:03:10.750> about<00:03:10.930> the<00:03:11.280> 615-620<00:03:12.280> mark<00:03:12.670> right

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:12.910 
goes it's about the 615-620 mark right

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:15.390 
goes it's about the 615-620 mark right
now<00:03:13.060> you<00:03:13.630> can<00:03:13.810> see<00:03:13.990> this<00:03:14.260> Banshee<00:03:14.530> is<00:03:14.950> coming

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:15.400 
now you can see this Banshee is coming

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:17.699 
now you can see this Banshee is coming
out<00:03:15.550> and<00:03:15.730> you<00:03:16.720> can<00:03:16.840> see<00:03:16.959> his<00:03:17.110> army<00:03:17.380> near<00:03:17.560> his

00:03:17.699 --> 00:03:17.709 
out and you can see his army near his

00:03:17.709 --> 00:03:21.000 
out and you can see his army near his
opponent<00:03:18.220> is<00:03:18.370> going<00:03:18.700> with<00:03:19.450> a<00:03:19.690> similar<00:03:20.170> 111

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:21.010 
opponent is going with a similar 111

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:22.480 
bill but you can see he's focusing on

bill but you can see he's focusing on
aliens<00:03:22.900> may<00:03:23.410> be<00:03:23.470> trying<00:03:23.709> to<00:03:23.800> get<00:03:23.920> some<00:03:24.130> expo

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:24.550 
aliens may be trying to get some expo

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:26.910 
aliens may be trying to get some expo
her<00:03:24.730> ass<00:03:24.880> in<00:03:25.150> there<00:03:25.440> but<00:03:26.440> little<00:03:26.680> does<00:03:26.830> you

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:26.920 
her ass in there but little does you

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:29.699 
her ass in there but little does you
know<00:03:27.040> there's<00:03:27.250> no<00:03:27.580> expo<00:03:27.940> to<00:03:28.000> harass<00:03:28.360> and<00:03:28.709> here

00:03:29.699 --> 00:03:29.709 
know there's no expo to harass and here

00:03:29.709 --> 00:03:31.590 
know there's no expo to harass and here
we'll<00:03:29.890> see<00:03:30.010> the<00:03:30.130> first<00:03:30.340> confrontation<00:03:30.700> of<00:03:31.360> the

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:31.600 
we'll see the first confrontation of the

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:34.320 
we'll see the first confrontation of the
game<00:03:32.250> the<00:03:33.250> Italians<00:03:33.670> will<00:03:33.760> likely<00:03:33.970> turn

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:34.330 
game the Italians will likely turn

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:36.840 
game the Italians will likely turn
around<00:03:34.600> there<00:03:34.930> they<00:03:35.050> go<00:03:35.080> and<00:03:36.070> that's<00:03:36.730> not

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:36.850 
around there they go and that's not

00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:38.280 
around there they go and that's not
really<00:03:36.910> good<00:03:37.300> for<00:03:37.330> his<00:03:37.600> composition<00:03:38.080> so<00:03:38.230> he

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:38.290 
really good for his composition so he

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:40.199 
really good for his composition so he
gets<00:03:38.470> a<00:03:38.530> little<00:03:38.650> split<00:03:38.980> in<00:03:39.100> there<00:03:39.280> and<00:03:39.489> then<00:03:40.180> I

00:03:40.199 --> 00:03:40.209 
gets a little split in there and then I

00:03:40.209 --> 00:03:43.259 
gets a little split in there and then I
uses<00:03:40.780> his<00:03:41.170> brush<00:03:41.739> not<00:03:42.370> brush<00:03:42.640> the<00:03:42.820> scheme<00:03:43.120> to

00:03:43.259 --> 00:03:43.269 
uses his brush not brush the scheme to

00:03:43.269 --> 00:03:44.880 
uses his brush not brush the scheme to
his<00:03:43.390> advantage<00:03:43.600> and<00:03:43.989> then<00:03:44.560> you<00:03:44.650> can<00:03:44.769> see

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:44.890 
his advantage and then you can see

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:48.180 
his advantage and then you can see
actually<00:03:45.220> gets<00:03:45.550> dropped<00:03:45.790> back<00:03:46.060> here<00:03:46.330> so<00:03:47.190> it's

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:48.190 
actually gets dropped back here so it's

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:49.590 
actually gets dropped back here so it's
kind<00:03:48.430> of<00:03:48.489> cool<00:03:48.640> to<00:03:48.730> see<00:03:48.940> that<00:03:49.120> in<00:03:49.269> a<00:03:49.360> build

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:49.600 
kind of cool to see that in a build

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:51.330 
kind of cool to see that in a build
order<00:03:49.840> that's<00:03:50.050> really<00:03:50.290> refined<00:03:50.709> because<00:03:51.220> you

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:51.340 
order that's really refined because you

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:52.620 
order that's really refined because you
can<00:03:51.459> see<00:03:51.580> he's<00:03:51.730> going<00:03:51.880> to<00:03:51.940> actually<00:03:52.150> have<00:03:52.510> to

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:52.630 
can see he's going to actually have to

00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:54.150 
can see he's going to actually have to
react<00:03:52.930> to<00:03:52.959> this<00:03:53.200> so<00:03:53.380> imma<00:03:53.590> speed<00:03:53.800> it<00:03:53.890> up<00:03:53.920> till

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:54.160 
react to this so imma speed it up till

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:56.580 
react to this so imma speed it up till
James<00:03:54.400> get<00:03:54.610> back<00:03:54.760> there<00:03:54.970> and<00:03:55.470> there<00:03:56.470> they<00:03:56.560> go

00:03:56.580 --> 00:03:56.590 
James get back there and there they go

00:03:56.590 --> 00:03:58.620 
James get back there and there they go
they<00:03:56.739> react<00:03:57.160> they<00:03:57.700> cleaned<00:03:57.940> it<00:03:58.030> up<00:03:58.150> reasonably

00:03:58.620 --> 00:03:58.630 
they react they cleaned it up reasonably

00:03:58.630 --> 00:04:00.150 
they react they cleaned it up reasonably
well<00:03:58.840> but<00:03:58.870> he<00:03:59.110> did<00:03:59.290> lose<00:03:59.500> a<00:03:59.530> lot<00:03:59.739> of<00:03:59.769> mining

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:00.160 
well but he did lose a lot of mining

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:03.509 
well but he did lose a lot of mining
time<00:04:00.370> he<00:04:01.000> lost<00:04:01.180> some<00:04:01.989> SUVs<00:04:02.140> there<00:04:02.739> you<00:04:03.220> know<00:04:03.370> so

00:04:03.509 --> 00:04:03.519 
time he lost some SUVs there you know so

00:04:03.519 --> 00:04:05.310 
time he lost some SUVs there you know so
that's<00:04:03.610> definitely<00:04:04.090> an<00:04:04.330> income<00:04:04.720> her<00:04:04.870> trim<00:04:05.080> and

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:05.320 
that's definitely an income her trim and

00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:09.570 
that's definitely an income her trim and
you<00:04:05.560> can<00:04:05.680> see<00:04:05.800> 25<00:04:07.080> suvs<00:04:08.080> for<00:04:08.470> him<00:04:08.769> 13<00:04:09.340> for<00:04:09.489> the

00:04:09.570 --> 00:04:09.580 
you can see 25 suvs for him 13 for the

00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:10.890 
you can see 25 suvs for him 13 for the
other<00:04:09.700> guy<00:04:09.820> but<00:04:10.030> he's<00:04:10.150> got<00:04:10.299> his<00:04:10.420> Banshee<00:04:10.840> in

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:10.900 
other guy but he's got his Banshee in

other guy but he's got his Banshee in
here<00:04:11.110> so<00:04:11.739> a<00:04:12.130> pretty<00:04:12.940> neat<00:04:13.209> thing<00:04:13.390> about<00:04:13.420> this

00:04:13.740 --> 00:04:13.750 
here so a pretty neat thing about this

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:16.080 
here so a pretty neat thing about this
build<00:04:13.989> it's<00:04:14.230> got<00:04:14.380> some<00:04:14.620> flexibility<00:04:15.280> right<00:04:15.459> so

00:04:16.080 --> 00:04:16.090 
build it's got some flexibility right so

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:18.449 
build it's got some flexibility right so
what<00:04:16.239> he<00:04:16.330> can<00:04:16.510> do<00:04:16.630> is<00:04:16.890> he<00:04:17.890> says<00:04:18.160> when<00:04:18.340> he's

00:04:18.449 --> 00:04:18.459 
what he can do is he says when he's

00:04:18.459 --> 00:04:20.430 
what he can do is he says when he's
attacking<00:04:18.850> he<00:04:19.479> can<00:04:19.630> get<00:04:19.690> his<00:04:19.840> van<00:04:20.049> sheet<00:04:20.290> in

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:33.370 
you can see even didn't micro that

00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:36.210 
you can see even didn't micro that
perfectly<00:04:33.820> but<00:04:34.480> I'm<00:04:34.690> still<00:04:35.170> gonna<00:04:35.530> likely<00:04:36.100> be

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:36.220 
perfectly but I'm still gonna likely be

00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:37.710 
perfectly but I'm still gonna likely be
able<00:04:36.370> to<00:04:36.460> take<00:04:36.670> out<00:04:36.820> this<00:04:36.970> game<00:04:37.210> don't<00:04:37.450> ruin<00:04:37.630> it

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:37.720 
able to take out this game don't ruin it

00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:39.390 
able to take out this game don't ruin it
for<00:04:37.900> you<00:04:37.960> guys<00:04:38.020> but<00:04:38.320> it<00:04:38.590> is<00:04:38.710> a<00:04:38.740> build<00:04:38.980> order<00:04:39.220> so

00:04:39.390 --> 00:04:39.400 
for you guys but it is a build order so

Banshee able to deal with those hellions
gets<00:04:44.860> in<00:04:45.040> before<00:04:45.190> that<00:04:45.370> bunker<00:04:45.880> because<00:04:46.030> he

00:04:46.230 --> 00:04:46.240 
gets in before that bunker because he

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:48.600 
gets in before that bunker because he
moved<00:04:46.450> out<00:04:46.630> early<00:04:47.110> and<00:04:47.380> you<00:04:47.710> see<00:04:47.920> even<00:04:48.400> had<00:04:48.520> to

00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:48.610 
moved out early and you see even had to

moved out early and you see even had to
pull<00:04:48.820> back<00:04:49.030> and<00:04:49.270> then<00:04:49.510> he<00:04:49.600> moved<00:04:49.810> out<00:04:49.930> again

00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:50.260 
pull back and then he moved out again

we're going to try and focus on specific

00:06:25.330 --> 00:06:28.290 
we're going to try and focus on specific
matchup<00:06:25.840> builds<00:06:26.200> and<00:06:26.320> unless<00:06:27.120> generic<00:06:28.120> build

00:06:28.290 --> 00:06:28.300 
matchup builds and unless generic build

00:06:28.300 --> 00:06:30.480 
matchup builds and unless generic build
so<00:06:28.450> these<00:06:28.570> are<00:06:28.750> kind<00:06:29.080> of<00:06:29.230> higher<00:06:29.680> level<00:06:30.040> builds

00:06:30.480 --> 00:06:30.490 
so these are kind of higher level builds

00:06:30.490 --> 00:06:32.460 
so these are kind of higher level builds
but<00:06:31.060> that's<00:06:31.660> what<00:06:31.780> a<00:06:31.810> lot<00:06:31.960> of<00:06:32.020> you<00:06:32.140> might<00:06:32.170> want

00:06:32.460 --> 00:06:32.470 
but that's what a lot of you might want

00:06:32.470 --> 00:06:34.500 
but that's what a lot of you might want
and<00:06:32.650> if<00:06:32.920> you<00:06:33.010> can't<00:06:33.190> do<00:06:33.310> it<00:06:33.340> perfectly<00:06:33.640> well

00:06:34.500 --> 00:06:34.510 
and if you can't do it perfectly well

00:06:34.510 --> 00:06:36.060 
and if you can't do it perfectly well
you<00:06:34.750> know<00:06:34.870> practice<00:06:35.380> to<00:06:35.620> get<00:06:35.710> it<00:06:35.890> to<00:06:36.040> that

00:06:36.060 --> 00:06:36.070 
you know practice to get it to that

00:06:36.070 --> 00:06:38.280 
you know practice to get it to that
higher<00:06:36.400> level<00:06:36.729> and<00:06:36.910> then<00:06:37.419> hopefully<00:06:37.990> it'll

00:06:38.280 --> 00:06:38.290 
higher level and then hopefully it'll

00:06:38.290 --> 00:06:38.850 
higher level and then hopefully it'll
work<00:06:38.320> for<00:06:38.590> you

00:06:38.850 --> 00:06:38.860 
work for you

00:06:38.860 --> 00:06:40.770 
work for you
when<00:06:39.490> you<00:06:39.639> do<00:06:39.789> get<00:06:39.939> to<00:06:40.090> that<00:06:40.180> higher<00:06:40.330> level<00:06:40.629> and

00:06:40.770 --> 00:06:40.780 
when you do get to that higher level and

00:06:40.780 --> 00:06:42.059 
when you do get to that higher level and
it<00:06:40.870> should<00:06:41.020> also<00:06:41.169> work<00:06:41.349> at<00:06:41.530> the<00:06:41.620> lower<00:06:41.770> levels

00:06:42.059 --> 00:06:42.069 
it should also work at the lower levels

00:06:42.069 --> 00:06:42.929 
it should also work at the lower levels
because<00:06:42.219> you'll<00:06:42.370> just<00:06:42.520> have<00:06:42.669> a<00:06:42.699> really

00:06:42.929 --> 00:06:42.939 
because you'll just have a really

00:06:42.939 --> 00:06:44.909 
because you'll just have a really
refined<00:06:43.389> Chris<00:06:43.810> build<00:06:44.080> so<00:06:44.650> I<00:06:44.680> hope<00:06:44.740> you<00:06:44.860> guys
