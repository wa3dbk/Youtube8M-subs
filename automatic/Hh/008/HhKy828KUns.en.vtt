hopefully going to start up this little
window<00:03:21.239> here<00:03:21.269> and<00:03:21.630> it's<00:03:21.900> going<00:03:22.080> to<00:03:22.140> look<00:03:22.260> like

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:22.320 
window here and it's going to look like

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:24.050 
window here and it's going to look like
a<00:03:22.500> little<00:03:22.680> command<00:03:23.100> prompt<00:03:23.430> except<00:03:23.790> it<00:03:23.880> says

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:27.900 
you're going to shut it down by typing

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:32.750 
you're going to shut it down by typing

now you're probably wondering like well
why<00:03:34.049> did<00:03:34.410> you<00:03:34.530> run<00:03:34.739> it<00:03:34.830> in<00:03:34.920> the<00:03:34.980> first<00:03:35.160> place<00:03:35.340> if

00:03:35.449 --> 00:03:35.459 
why did you run it in the first place if

00:03:35.459 --> 00:03:36.860 
why did you run it in the first place if
you're<00:03:35.610> just<00:03:35.730> going<00:03:35.850> to<00:03:35.910> close<00:03:36.150> it<00:03:36.360> well<00:03:36.750> when

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:36.870 
you're just going to close it well when

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:38.240 
you're just going to close it well when
you<00:03:36.959> start<00:03:37.230> it<00:03:37.290> up<00:03:37.350> for<00:03:37.410> the<00:03:37.560> first<00:03:37.769> time<00:03:38.010> it

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:38.250 
you start it up for the first time it

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:40.070 
you start it up for the first time it
runs<00:03:38.489> a<00:03:38.610> startup<00:03:38.970> sequence<00:03:39.150> which<00:03:39.630> creates

00:03:40.070 --> 00:03:40.080 
runs a startup sequence which creates

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:42.940 
runs a startup sequence which creates
this<00:03:40.950> folder<00:03:41.459> and<00:03:41.610> it's<00:03:42.090> going<00:03:42.209> to<00:03:42.269> have

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:42.950

and<00:04:12.360> dev<00:04:13.320> test<00:04:13.740> now<00:04:14.160> that<00:04:14.400> is<00:04:14.580> case-sensitive

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:14.910 
and dev test now that is case-sensitive

00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:17.510 
and dev test now that is case-sensitive
you<00:04:15.570> have<00:04:15.750> to<00:04:15.930> have<00:04:16.080> the<00:04:16.230> D<00:04:16.470> a<00:04:16.709> capital<00:04:17.280> D

00:04:17.510 --> 00:04:17.520 
you have to have the D a capital D

00:04:17.520 --> 00:04:19.280 
you have to have the D a capital D
otherwise<00:04:18.000> when<00:04:18.600> you<00:04:18.630> try<00:04:18.900> and<00:04:18.959> connect<00:04:19.260> to

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:19.290 
otherwise when you try and connect to

00:04:19.290 --> 00:04:20.780 
otherwise when you try and connect to
the<00:04:19.440> server<00:04:19.620> it'll<00:04:19.950> say<00:04:20.190> it's<00:04:20.430> running

00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:20.790 
the server it'll say it's running

00:04:20.790 --> 00:04:23.750 
the server it'll say it's running
corrupted<00:04:21.239> files<00:04:21.530> if<00:04:22.530> you<00:04:22.860> made<00:04:23.130> a<00:04:23.160> server<00:04:23.520> in

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:23.760 
corrupted files if you made a server in

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:25.940 
corrupted files if you made a server in
the<00:04:23.880> level<00:04:24.150> editor<00:04:24.270> and<00:04:24.630> saved<00:04:24.930> it<00:04:25.140> that<00:04:25.740> is

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:25.950 
the level editor and saved it that is

00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:28.490 
the level editor and saved it that is
where<00:04:26.220> you<00:04:26.520> would<00:04:26.610> enter<00:04:26.820> in<00:04:27.120> your<00:04:27.630> level<00:04:28.260> name

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:28.500 
where you would enter in your level name

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:30.500 
where you would enter in your level name
in<00:04:28.740> order<00:04:28.860> to<00:04:28.980> play<00:04:29.310> on<00:04:29.460> it<00:04:29.610> make<00:04:30.060> sure<00:04:30.270> that

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:30.510 
in order to play on it make sure that

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:31.910 
in order to play on it make sure that
everything<00:04:30.990> is<00:04:31.050> correct<00:04:31.260> about<00:04:31.530> the<00:04:31.770> name

00:04:31.910 --> 00:04:31.920 
everything is correct about the name

00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:33.650 
everything is correct about the name
because<00:04:32.160> one<00:04:32.400> misspelling<00:04:33.060> will<00:04:33.210> mess<00:04:33.390> it<00:04:33.570> up

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:33.660 
because one misspelling will mess it up

00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:36.110 
because one misspelling will mess it up
so<00:04:33.870> there<00:04:34.350> we<00:04:34.440> go<00:04:34.470> map<00:04:34.890> dev<00:04:35.190> tests<00:04:35.640> let's<00:04:35.850> set

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:36.120 
so there we go map dev tests let's set

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:38.390 
so there we go map dev tests let's set
the<00:04:36.300> porch<00:04:36.600> to<00:04:36.900> some<00:04:37.140> things<00:04:37.350> I'll<00:04:37.650> do<00:04:37.860> port<00:04:38.190> 2

00:04:38.390 --> 00:04:38.400 
the porch to some things I'll do port 2

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:40.580 
the porch to some things I'll do port 2
5<00:04:38.670> 4<00:04:38.940> 4<00:04:39.150> 4<00:04:39.480> we're<00:04:40.170> going<00:04:40.290> to<00:04:40.350> give<00:04:40.470> it<00:04:40.530> a

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:40.590 
5 4 4 4 we're going to give it a

00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:45.850 
5 4 4 4 we're going to give it a
password<00:04:40.860> so<00:04:41.430> type<00:04:41.610> in<00:04:41.730> password<00:04:43.010> 1<00:04:44.010> 2<00:04:44.220> 3<00:04:44.460> and

00:04:45.850 --> 00:04:45.860 
password so type in password 1 2 3 and

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:48.260 
password so type in password 1 2 3 and
from<00:04:46.860> there<00:04:47.130> I<00:04:47.160> think<00:04:47.580> we're<00:04:47.760> pretty<00:04:48.000> much

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:48.270 
from there I think we're pretty much

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:50.450 
from there I think we're pretty much
good<00:04:48.540> to<00:04:48.570> go<00:04:48.750> so<00:04:49.440> you<00:04:49.500> can<00:04:49.650> close<00:04:49.890> it<00:04:49.920> now<00:04:50.280> there

00:04:50.450 --> 00:04:50.460 
good to go so you can close it now there

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:52.340 
good to go so you can close it now there
is<00:04:50.580> a<00:04:50.610> big<00:04:51.000> long<00:04:51.270> list<00:04:51.570> of<00:04:51.690> commands<00:04:52.080> that<00:04:52.260> you

00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:52.350 
is a big long list of commands that you

00:04:52.350 --> 00:04:54.620 
is a big long list of commands that you
can<00:04:52.500> do<00:04:52.710> this<00:04:53.220> is<00:04:53.460> the<00:04:53.640> bare-bones<00:04:53.850> like<00:04:54.420> this

00:04:54.620 --> 00:04:54.630 
can do this is the bare-bones like this

00:04:54.630 --> 00:04:56.180 
can do this is the bare-bones like this
will<00:04:54.810> make<00:04:54.840> like<00:04:55.200> the<00:04:55.380> server<00:04:55.620> work<00:04:55.950> and

00:04:56.180 --> 00:04:56.190 
will make like the server work and

00:04:56.190 --> 00:04:58.550 
will make like the server work and
pretty<00:04:56.370> much<00:04:56.550> nothing<00:04:57.000> else<00:04:57.210> but<00:04:57.870> if<00:04:58.080> you<00:04:58.350> want

00:04:58.550 --> 00:04:58.560 
pretty much nothing else but if you want

00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:00.650 
pretty much nothing else but if you want
to<00:04:58.620> get<00:04:58.770> more<00:04:58.980> complex<00:04:59.400> like<00:04:59.730> making<00:05:00.060> it<00:05:00.150> PvE

00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:00.660 
to get more complex like making it PvE

00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:02.450 
to get more complex like making it PvE
or<00:05:01.020> like<00:05:01.230> whitelisting<00:05:01.920> players<00:05:02.190> or

00:05:02.450 --> 00:05:02.460 
or like whitelisting players or

00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:04.310 
or like whitelisting players or
blacklisting<00:05:03.060> players<00:05:03.330> i<00:05:03.600> will<00:05:03.930> put<00:05:04.080> a<00:05:04.110> big

00:05:04.310 --> 00:05:04.320 
blacklisting players i will put a big

00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:06.200 
blacklisting players i will put a big
long<00:05:04.620> list<00:05:04.830> of<00:05:05.100> commands<00:05:05.490> that<00:05:05.610> you<00:05:05.760> can<00:05:05.910> enter

00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:06.210 
long list of commands that you can enter

00:05:06.210 --> 00:05:08.000 
long list of commands that you can enter
into<00:05:06.390> here<00:05:06.810> in<00:05:06.930> the<00:05:07.320> description<00:05:07.800> down<00:05:07.950> below

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:08.010 
into here in the description down below

00:05:08.010 --> 00:05:09.950 
into here in the description down below
so<00:05:08.520> now<00:05:08.820> you<00:05:09.060> can<00:05:09.210> customize<00:05:09.390> your<00:05:09.660> server

00:05:09.950 --> 00:05:09.960 
so now you can customize your server

00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:12.320 
so now you can customize your server
even<00:05:10.230> more<00:05:10.500> but<00:05:10.740> since<00:05:10.920> 3.0<00:05:11.520> is<00:05:11.670> so<00:05:11.820> early<00:05:12.060> in

00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:12.330 
even more but since 3.0 is so early in

00:05:12.330 --> 00:05:14.690 
even more but since 3.0 is so early in
its<00:05:12.510> development<00:05:12.810> stage<00:05:13.680> it's<00:05:14.370> kind<00:05:14.640> of

00:05:14.690 --> 00:05:14.700 
its development stage it's kind of

00:05:14.700 --> 00:05:16.910 
its development stage it's kind of
pointless<00:05:14.850> to<00:05:15.240> make<00:05:15.390> a<00:05:15.420> true<00:05:16.260> dedicated

00:05:16.910 --> 00:05:16.920 
pointless to make a true dedicated

00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:18.590 
pointless to make a true dedicated
server<00:05:17.190> at<00:05:17.400> this<00:05:17.550> point<00:05:17.910> so<00:05:18.360> we're<00:05:18.450> going<00:05:18.540> to

00:05:18.590 --> 00:05:18.600 
server at this point so we're going to

00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:21.170 
server at this point so we're going to
close<00:05:18.870> it<00:05:19.140> and<00:05:19.320> press<00:05:19.590> save<00:05:19.920> and<00:05:20.280> then<00:05:20.880> we<00:05:21.060> are

00:05:21.170 --> 00:05:21.180 
close it and press save and then we are

00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:24.020 
close it and press save and then we are
good<00:05:21.420> to<00:05:21.570> go<00:05:21.750> so<00:05:22.020> now<00:05:22.140> let's<00:05:22.350> run<00:05:22.590> our<00:05:23.030> unturned

00:05:24.020 --> 00:05:24.030 
good to go so now let's run our unturned

00:05:24.030 --> 00:05:26.780 
good to go so now let's run our unturned
server<00:05:24.450> shortcut<00:05:25.200> and<00:05:25.530> now<00:05:26.160> when<00:05:26.460> you<00:05:26.550> pop<00:05:26.760> it

00:05:26.780 --> 00:05:26.790 
server shortcut and now when you pop it

00:05:26.790 --> 00:05:28.970 
server shortcut and now when you pop it
up<00:05:27.000> it<00:05:27.270> should<00:05:27.450> say<00:05:27.690> successfully<00:05:28.380> set<00:05:28.620> map<00:05:28.800> to

problems<00:05:34.680> just<00:05:34.920> go<00:05:35.070> back<00:05:35.250> and<00:05:35.460> recheck<00:05:35.850> what

00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:36.090 
problems just go back and recheck what

00:05:36.090 --> 00:05:38.270 
problems just go back and recheck what
you<00:05:36.180> typed<00:05:36.420> in<00:05:36.660> I<00:05:36.870> also<00:05:37.260> make<00:05:37.590> sure<00:05:37.620> that<00:05:37.800> dev

00:05:38.270 --> 00:05:38.280 
you typed in I also make sure that dev

00:05:38.280 --> 00:05:41.660 
you typed in I also make sure that dev
test<00:05:38.520> has<00:05:38.790> a<00:05:38.820> capital<00:05:39.300> D<00:05:39.540> and<00:05:39.720> from<00:05:40.470> here<00:05:41.010> we

00:05:41.660 --> 00:05:41.670 
test has a capital D and from here we

00:05:41.670 --> 00:05:43.340 
test has a capital D and from here we
are<00:05:41.700> good<00:05:42.090> to<00:05:42.270> go<00:05:42.510> now<00:05:42.840> we<00:05:42.900> just<00:05:43.110> need<00:05:43.200> to

00:05:43.340 --> 00:05:43.350 
are good to go now we just need to

00:05:43.350 --> 00:05:44.570 
are good to go now we just need to
figure<00:05:43.470> out<00:05:43.590> how<00:05:43.770> to<00:05:43.830> connect<00:05:44.280> to<00:05:44.430> our<00:05:44.550> server

00:05:44.570 --> 00:05:44.580 
figure out how to connect to our server

00:05:44.580 --> 00:05:48.110 
figure out how to connect to our server
so<00:05:45.510> I<00:05:45.870> have<00:05:46.200> to<00:05:46.320> enter<00:05:46.560> in<00:05:46.680> my<00:05:46.830> ipv4<00:05:47.730> address

00:05:48.110 --> 00:05:48.120 
so I have to enter in my ipv4 address

00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:51.970 
so I have to enter in my ipv4 address
which<00:05:48.600> you<00:05:48.630> can<00:05:48.870> find<00:05:49.140> by<00:05:49.410> typing<00:05:49.800> in<00:05:49.950> CMD<00:05:50.460> and

00:05:51.970 --> 00:05:51.980 
which you can find by typing in CMD and

00:05:51.980 --> 00:05:55.670 
which you can find by typing in CMD and
running<00:05:52.980> as<00:05:53.100> administrator<00:05:54.320> typing<00:05:55.320> in<00:05:55.440> IP

00:05:55.670 --> 00:05:55.680 
running as administrator typing in IP

00:05:55.680 --> 00:05:59.090 
running as administrator typing in IP
config<00:05:56.550> and<00:05:56.790> it<00:05:57.480> will<00:05:57.570> give<00:05:57.720> you<00:05:57.930> your<00:05:58.230> ipv4

00:05:59.090 --> 00:05:59.100 
config and it will give you your ipv4

00:05:59.100 --> 00:06:03.500 
config and it will give you your ipv4
address<00:05:59.400> right<00:05:59.670> here<00:05:59.700> mine<00:06:00.150> is<00:06:00.420> 10.0.0.0<00:06:02.510> be
