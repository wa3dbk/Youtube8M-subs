at the actual Remington r5 attachments I
like<00:01:32.700> to<00:01:32.850> go<00:01:32.970> with<00:01:33.000> the<00:01:33.180> red<00:01:33.420> dot<00:01:33.659> sight<00:01:33.930> and

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200 
like to go with the red dot sight and

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:35.990 
like to go with the red dot sight and
the<00:01:34.320> muzzle<00:01:34.680> brake<00:01:35.070> attachment<00:01:35.820> as<00:01:35.909> I

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
the muzzle brake attachment as I

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:37.069 
the muzzle brake attachment as I
mentioned<00:01:36.360> towards<00:01:36.479> the<00:01:36.630> beginning<00:01:36.720> of<00:01:36.930> this

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:37.079 
mentioned towards the beginning of this

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:38.870 
mentioned towards the beginning of this
video<00:01:37.320> I<00:01:37.470> don't<00:01:37.530> like<00:01:38.009> the<00:01:38.159> iron<00:01:38.340> sights<00:01:38.640> very

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
video I don't like the iron sights very

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:40.880 
video I don't like the iron sights very
much<00:01:39.090> if<00:01:39.420> you<00:01:39.630> guys<00:01:39.810> can<00:01:40.200> work<00:01:40.380> with<00:01:40.650> the<00:01:40.740> iron

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890 
much if you guys can work with the iron

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:42.260 
much if you guys can work with the iron
sights<00:01:41.189> and<00:01:41.400> that's<00:01:41.549> fantastic<00:01:41.700> you<00:01:42.240> can

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
sights and that's fantastic you can

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:44.210 
sights and that's fantastic you can
always<00:01:42.600> free<00:01:43.020> up<00:01:43.200> the<00:01:43.409> red<00:01:43.560> dot<00:01:43.770> sight<00:01:43.979> and<00:01:44.130> use

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:44.220 
always free up the red dot sight and use

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:45.980 
always free up the red dot sight and use
something<00:01:44.549> else<00:01:44.640> but<00:01:44.850> personally<00:01:45.390> I<00:01:45.540> feel

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:45.990 
something else but personally I feel

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:48.050 
something else but personally I feel
this<00:01:46.200> weapon<00:01:46.920> works<00:01:47.070> very<00:01:47.430> very<00:01:47.549> well<00:01:47.909> with

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060 
this weapon works very very well with

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:50.330 
this weapon works very very well with
the<00:01:48.149> red<00:01:48.299> dot<00:01:48.509> sight<00:01:48.780> it<00:01:49.229> has<00:01:49.350> a<00:01:49.380> very<00:01:49.799> minimal

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:50.340 
the red dot sight it has a very minimal

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:51.859 
the red dot sight it has a very minimal
recoil<00:01:50.579> that's<00:01:51.119> why<00:01:51.240> I<00:01:51.270> haven't<00:01:51.600> used<00:01:51.750> the

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869 
recoil that's why I haven't used the

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:53.719 
recoil that's why I haven't used the
full<00:01:52.110> grip<00:01:52.350> on<00:01:52.500> this<00:01:52.649> weapon<00:01:52.860> and<00:01:53.220> once<00:01:53.610> you

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:53.729 
full grip on this weapon and once you

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:55.280 
full grip on this weapon and once you
get<00:01:53.850> used<00:01:54.000> to<00:01:54.119> this<00:01:54.180> recoil<00:01:54.630> is<00:01:54.689> very<00:01:54.780> very

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:55.290 
get used to this recoil is very very

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:56.780 
get used to this recoil is very very
manageable<00:01:55.590> and<00:01:55.979> you<00:01:56.070> just<00:01:56.219> don't<00:01:56.430> need<00:01:56.579> it<00:01:56.759> so

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:56.790 
manageable and you just don't need it so

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:58.429 
manageable and you just don't need it so
it<00:01:56.969> frees<00:01:57.240> up<00:01:57.270> a<00:01:57.540> slot<00:01:57.780> that's<00:01:57.990> why<00:01:58.110> the<00:01:58.170> red

00:01:58.429 --> 00:01:58.439 
it frees up a slot that's why the red

00:01:58.439 --> 00:01:59.929 
it frees up a slot that's why the red
dot<00:01:58.710> sight<00:01:58.979> and<00:01:59.219> the<00:01:59.280> muzzle<00:01:59.520> brake<00:01:59.640> work

00:01:59.929 --> 00:01:59.939 
dot sight and the muzzle brake work

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:01.459 
dot sight and the muzzle brake work
really<00:02:00.180> really<00:02:00.299> well<00:02:00.509> so<00:02:00.780> the<00:02:00.840> red<00:02:00.990> dot<00:02:01.200> sight

00:02:01.459 --> 00:02:01.469 
really really well so the red dot sight

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:03.590 
really really well so the red dot sight
just<00:02:02.009> gives<00:02:02.159> you<00:02:02.280> better<00:02:02.520> a<00:02:02.700> viewpoint<00:02:03.509> when

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:03.600 
just gives you better a viewpoint when

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:04.969 
just gives you better a viewpoint when
you<00:02:03.659> actually<00:02:03.750> aiming<00:02:04.200> down<00:02:04.320> sight<00:02:04.619> however

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:04.979 
you actually aiming down sight however

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:06.139 
you actually aiming down sight however
the<00:02:05.250> muzzle<00:02:05.610> brake<00:02:05.729> is<00:02:05.850> a<00:02:05.880> little<00:02:06.060> bit

00:02:06.139 --> 00:02:06.149 
the muzzle brake is a little bit

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:08.169 
the muzzle brake is a little bit
different<00:02:06.509> this<00:02:06.570> actually<00:02:07.049> helps<00:02:07.439> you<00:02:07.619> and

00:02:08.169 --> 00:02:08.179 
different this actually helps you and

00:02:08.179 --> 00:02:11.270 
different this actually helps you and
ranges<00:02:09.179> where<00:02:09.569> the<00:02:09.899> weapon<00:02:10.470> damage<00:02:10.649> starts<00:02:11.009> to

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:11.280 
ranges where the weapon damage starts to

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:13.520 
ranges where the weapon damage starts to
drop<00:02:11.459> off<00:02:11.640> so<00:02:11.849> essentially<00:02:12.330> this<00:02:12.480> weapon<00:02:12.900> will

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530 
drop off so essentially this weapon will

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:15.500 
drop off so essentially this weapon will
you<00:02:13.650> assert<00:02:14.370> some<00:02:14.520> add<00:02:14.610> damage<00:02:15.000> up<00:02:15.180> to<00:02:15.240> a

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:15.510 
you assert some add damage up to a

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:17.780 
you assert some add damage up to a
certain<00:02:15.720> range<00:02:16.140> and<00:02:16.440> then<00:02:16.860> at<00:02:17.069> that<00:02:17.220> range<00:02:17.520> it

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:17.790 
certain range and then at that range it

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:19.580 
certain range and then at that range it
will<00:02:17.970> drop<00:02:18.300> off<00:02:18.569> and<00:02:18.780> start<00:02:19.020> doing<00:02:19.260> less

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:19.590 
will drop off and start doing less

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:22.040 
will drop off and start doing less
damage<00:02:19.620> all<00:02:20.520> the<00:02:20.700> way<00:02:20.790> to<00:02:20.850> another<00:02:21.420> range

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:22.050 
damage all the way to another range

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:23.570 
damage all the way to another range
point<00:02:22.410> where<00:02:22.560> we'll<00:02:22.680> start<00:02:22.890> doing<00:02:23.130> minimum

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:23.580 
point where we'll start doing minimum

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:25.280 
point where we'll start doing minimum
damage<00:02:23.850> so<00:02:24.180> you've<00:02:24.300> got<00:02:24.510> the<00:02:24.660> maximum<00:02:25.110> damage

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:25.290 
damage so you've got the maximum damage

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:27.710 
damage so you've got the maximum damage
at<00:02:25.560> close<00:02:25.850> minimum<00:02:26.850> damage<00:02:27.030> at<00:02:27.270> long<00:02:27.450> range

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:27.720 
at close minimum damage at long range

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:29.809 
at close minimum damage at long range
and<00:02:27.900> then<00:02:28.110> between<00:02:28.380> that<00:02:28.830> drop-off<00:02:29.370> point<00:02:29.670> you

00:02:29.809 --> 00:02:29.819 
and then between that drop-off point you

00:02:29.819 --> 00:02:31.729 
and then between that drop-off point you
start<00:02:30.090> doing<00:02:30.239> less<00:02:30.480> and<00:02:30.510> less<00:02:30.750> damage<00:02:31.020> what

00:02:31.729 --> 00:02:31.739 
start doing less and less damage what

00:02:31.739 --> 00:02:33.770 
start doing less and less damage what
the<00:02:31.950> muzzle<00:02:32.310> rate<00:02:32.459> does<00:02:32.670> is<00:02:32.850> essentially<00:02:33.270> make

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:33.780 
the muzzle rate does is essentially make

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:36.170 
the muzzle rate does is essentially make
that<00:02:34.020> distance<00:02:34.290> further<00:02:35.010> meaning<00:02:36.000> that

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:36.180 
that distance further meaning that

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:37.670 
that distance further meaning that
you're<00:02:36.270> going<00:02:36.390> to<00:02:36.450> be<00:02:36.510> doing<00:02:36.600> maximum<00:02:37.260> damage

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:37.680 
you're going to be doing maximum damage

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:39.800 
you're going to be doing maximum damage
for<00:02:38.130> longer<00:02:38.550> distances<00:02:39.030> hopefully<00:02:39.630> that

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:39.810 
for longer distances hopefully that

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:41.540 
for longer distances hopefully that
makes<00:02:40.050> sense<00:02:40.260> it<00:02:40.650> basically<00:02:41.100> just<00:02:41.190> means<00:02:41.430> that

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:41.550 
makes sense it basically just means that

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:42.890 
makes sense it basically just means that
using<00:02:41.730> the<00:02:41.910> muzzle<00:02:42.209> brake<00:02:42.360> this<00:02:42.480> weapon<00:02:42.840> is

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:42.900 
using the muzzle brake this weapon is

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:44.630 
using the muzzle brake this weapon is
going<00:02:43.020> to<00:02:43.110> kill<00:02:43.290> quicker<00:02:43.680> at<00:02:43.920> those<00:02:44.069> medium

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:44.640 
going to kill quicker at those medium

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:46.670 
going to kill quicker at those medium
ranges<00:02:45.090> so<00:02:45.510> the<00:02:45.600> range<00:02:45.810> is<00:02:45.989> where<00:02:46.110> normally

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:46.680 
ranges so the range is where normally

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:48.380 
ranges so the range is where normally
the<00:02:46.830> damage<00:02:47.100> would<00:02:47.190> be<00:02:47.310> dropping<00:02:47.580> off<00:02:47.820> so<00:02:48.300> it

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:48.390 
the damage would be dropping off so it

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:50.090 
the damage would be dropping off so it
makes<00:02:48.570> a<00:02:48.660> weapon<00:02:48.959> even<00:02:49.140> more<00:02:49.500> strong<00:02:49.920> and

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:50.100 
makes a weapon even more strong and

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:51.560 
makes a weapon even more strong and
means<00:02:50.489> it<00:02:50.610> going<00:02:50.730> to<00:02:50.820> winning<00:02:51.090> even<00:02:51.300> more

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:51.570 
means it going to winning even more

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:53.509 
means it going to winning even more
gunfights<00:02:52.080> at<00:02:52.230> all<00:02:52.380> ranges<00:02:52.800> so<00:02:52.980> very<00:02:53.250> very

00:02:53.509 --> 00:02:53.519 
gunfights at all ranges so very very

00:02:53.519 --> 00:02:55.610 
gunfights at all ranges so very very
useful<00:02:53.730> there<00:02:54.120> definitely<00:02:54.630> recommend<00:02:55.050> it<00:02:55.200> in

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:55.620 
useful there definitely recommend it in

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:57.020 
useful there definitely recommend it in
terms<00:02:55.830> of<00:02:56.010> secondary<00:02:56.459> lethal<00:02:56.850> and<00:02:57.000> tactical

00:02:57.020 --> 00:02:57.030 
terms of secondary lethal and tactical

00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:59.600 
terms of secondary lethal and tactical

so<00:04:04.620> as<00:04:04.709> I<00:04:04.799> said<00:04:04.920> this<00:04:04.980> is<00:04:05.040> more<00:04:05.340> geared<00:04:05.609> towards

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:05.670 
so as I said this is more geared towards

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:08.060 
so as I said this is more geared towards
those<00:04:06.000> longer<00:04:06.450> streaks<00:04:06.810> now<00:04:07.320> two<00:04:07.380> perks<00:04:07.890> I've

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:08.070 
those longer streaks now two perks I've

00:04:08.070 --> 00:04:10.520 
those longer streaks now two perks I've
dropped<00:04:08.370> are<00:04:08.640> both<00:04:08.880> ready<00:04:09.239> up<00:04:09.450> and<00:04:09.690> quick-draw

00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:10.530 
dropped are both ready up and quick-draw

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:12.080

quick-draw<00:04:10.920> across<00:04:11.160> three<00:04:11.430> points<00:04:11.760> was<00:04:11.880> very

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:12.090 
quick-draw across three points was very

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:14.270 
quick-draw across three points was very
expensive<00:04:12.450> and<00:04:12.810> dropping<00:04:13.410> those<00:04:13.560> perks<00:04:13.859> means

00:04:14.270 --> 00:04:14.280 
expensive and dropping those perks means

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:15.710 
expensive and dropping those perks means
I<00:04:14.459> won't<00:04:14.609> be<00:04:14.790> able<00:04:14.880> to<00:04:15.000> react<00:04:15.239> quite<00:04:15.570> as

I won't be able to react quite as

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:18.860 
I won't be able to react quite as
quickly<00:04:15.989> in<00:04:16.549> close<00:04:17.549> quarter<00:04:18.000> combat<00:04:18.030> but<00:04:18.720> the

00:04:18.860 --> 00:04:18.870 
quickly in close quarter combat but the

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:20.150 
quickly in close quarter combat but the
idea<00:04:19.200> is<00:04:19.320> I'm<00:04:19.440> going<00:04:19.560> to<00:04:19.620> be<00:04:19.680> going<00:04:19.890> into<00:04:20.010> as

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:20.160 
idea is I'm going to be going into as

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:21.860 
idea is I'm going to be going into as
many<00:04:20.400> gunfights<00:04:20.910> as<00:04:21.060> possible<00:04:21.570> with<00:04:21.690> my

00:04:21.860 --> 00:04:21.870 
many gunfights as possible with my
