00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:01.420
 for me all 

00:00:01.420 --> 00:00:04.420
 for this second video devoted to online caste 

00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:06.170
 I introduce you 

00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:09.220
 rub arenas in flow with the baby afp 

00:00:09.879 --> 00:00:13.839
 alas by killing to stop in addition to playing on a patient and his voice is going 

00:00:13.839 --> 00:00:15.859
 to play 

00:00:15.859 --> 00:00:17.529
 pc players 

00:00:17.529 --> 00:00:20.250
 in the study to exist here 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:22.140
 according to thierry thuillier 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:25.980
 in the fed up and we are well here cyr a friend in a box 

00:00:26.909 --> 00:00:29.909
 a Belgian menu at the same caste 

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:31.509
 and if we go 

00:00:31.509 --> 00:00:34.509
 we are on a draw 

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:37.870
 so now we will have a little bit of steps 

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:41.050
 after being sure of course is when we are in August 2010 

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:45.050
 there is very beautiful golden sun 

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:47.500
 the door panels but we will stay 

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:49.330
 right here 

00:00:49.330 --> 00:00:52.330
 for a little bit the steps philippe maumet a job 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:56.180
 ten years later because its date of 2000 inc 

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:59.440
 the opportunity for businesses a box to play together a first 

00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:04.240
 was made and then for that we need 

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:07.820
 a cost and that three devices of the same caste 

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:10.650
 that one 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:11.760
 that one 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:12.700
 dr 

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:13.820
 it 

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:15.600
 here you have to see that 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:17.680
 so yes theoretically jean-louis cabrespine 

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:21.040
 and as in the idea of â€‹â€‹having to play my network 

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:24.040
 we were in a saucepan photo ddm 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:26.950
 that's already a first thing 

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:28.750
 renal side 

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:32.040
 he will leave you will be castrate then on me 

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:34.800
 you need 

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:38.210
 quake 3 pc and regina theoretically in order 

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:42.660
 the ulco and that 

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:45.660
 Since six months 

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:49.590
 if it's almost that 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:52.690
 but it's wrong 

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:55.900
 the act 

00:01:55.900 --> 00:01:58.150
 it's still short 

00:01:58.150 --> 00:02:00.670
 if your bet dared for the war 

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:02.680
 after a few hours of lull 

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:03.970
 and 

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:05.800
 what is needed now 

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:08.800
 cqp files and mornings and pack 

00:02:09.589 --> 00:02:13.089
 will agree with whom and with the same caste once that's done 

00:02:13.619 --> 00:02:16.619
 so you know on your pc 

00:02:25.669 --> 00:02:28.399
 while you have on pc 

00:02:28.399 --> 00:02:32.989
 your files normally at the base if I'm wrong morvan a patch more 

00:02:34.709 --> 00:02:36.289
 at all 

00:02:36.289 --> 00:02:39.289
 it's more and more rainy 

00:02:39.939 --> 00:02:41.640
 these documents the mapaq 

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:44.199
 the update that corresponds 

00:02:44.199 --> 00:02:47.869
 you play with cost 3 but it's a little fischer poucet when 

00:02:47.869 --> 00:02:50.109
 the acquittal install them on your pc 

00:02:50.109 --> 00:02:52.809
 it takes then your pc will be really 

00:02:52.809 --> 00:02:55.809
 compatible with the text version once it's done 

00:02:57.189 --> 00:03:00.189
 in this mode 

00:03:06.759 --> 00:03:08.239
 the ideal at that moment 

00:03:08.239 --> 00:03:11.279
 it's on the same box already 

00:03:11.279 --> 00:03:14.459
 once you have launched boudjellal I remember a jazz from montreal 

00:03:14.459 --> 00:03:17.459
 it's typical 

00:03:19.979 --> 00:03:21.219
 really the same 

00:03:21.219 --> 00:03:23.479
 more and more 

00:03:23.479 --> 00:03:26.479
 it is ideal for playing quickly and easily 

00:03:28.379 --> 00:03:31.379
 golden comets moment it starts strong 

00:03:32.179 --> 00:03:35.529
 + not was on vacation in Tuscany furthermore yielded 

00:03:35.529 --> 00:03:38.349
 to taste the version and to this contest then in an ambush on the 

00:03:38.349 --> 00:03:39.719
 high school 

00:03:39.719 --> 00:03:43.059
 such a mechanism 

00:03:43.059 --> 00:03:45.509
 you put infrasound completely phony 

00:03:45.509 --> 00:03:47.779
 no matter 

00:03:47.779 --> 00:03:51.009
 here it will be on the bns which actually 

00:03:51.009 --> 00:03:54.009
 in vain if you ask me it is in any case it works perfectly 

00:03:57.379 --> 00:03:59.199
 then mexico 

00:03:59.199 --> 00:04:02.199
 by the graceful that an act 

00:04:06.079 --> 00:04:09.349
 we wait moment it even takes my principle is on fire since its a little bit 

00:04:09.349 --> 00:04:11.809
 local trick monge come to an end 

00:04:11.809 --> 00:04:16.139
 so here's the connect the mining it stands every five years 

00:04:17.859 --> 00:04:21.040
 however, the two convoys were the only ones that did not worry - the war 

00:04:21.039 --> 00:04:22.539
 mercedes clans 

00:04:22.539 --> 00:04:23.819
 while that one 

00:04:23.819 --> 00:04:27.809
 to recover -without the cps and that you will put much too much on pc 

00:04:27.809 --> 00:04:29.449
 to recover 

00:04:29.449 --> 00:04:32.449
 Of course, there will be your pc 

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:36.180
 the tpr 

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:38.620
 alas actually specify 

00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:41.439
 and then in May as well as city-dwellers 

00:04:41.439 --> 00:04:44.439
 French style 80 

00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:48.240
 169 

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:50.930
 187 

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:53.930
 point 240 

00:04:57.379 --> 00:05:00.370
 a priori it has three flavors nickel 

00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:03.370
 and they will go there 

00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:05.550
 Zoellick 

00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:08.150
 when in the end 

00:05:08.150 --> 00:05:10.990
 subsequently 

00:05:10.990 --> 00:05:12.370
 naturally 

00:05:12.370 --> 00:05:15.719
 we are left alone and his load 

00:05:15.719 --> 00:05:17.509
 that's clear 

00:05:17.509 --> 00:05:19.360
 but everyone a spectator 

00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:22.360
 finally even if m 

00:05:24.330 --> 00:05:27.419
 and then we appreciate an American because playing the same fate 

00:05:29.969 --> 00:05:32.029
 you estimate 

00:05:32.029 --> 00:05:34.599
 we will drop in hospitals under a douala bridge 

00:05:34.599 --> 00:05:36.159
 they are in the business 

00:05:36.159 --> 00:05:39.159
 and then if we turn 

00:05:40.699 --> 00:05:43.699
 we are left with nine pc players 

00:05:46.879 --> 00:05:49.559
 that's if you need the files 

00:05:49.559 --> 00:05:52.110
 for to configure it on pc 

00:05:52.110 --> 00:05:55.840
 it's possible if you need a course at the committee ideas by me 

00:05:55.840 --> 00:05:58.259
 request 

00:05:58.259 --> 00:05:58.829
 they are the ones
