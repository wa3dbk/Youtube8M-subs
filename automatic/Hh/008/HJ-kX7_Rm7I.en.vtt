00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:19.010 
job I use it on just about any vehicle

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:21.729 
job I use it on just about any vehicle
because<00:02:19.580> it<00:02:19.790> does<00:02:20.030> look<00:02:20.360> great<00:02:20.690> on<00:02:20.930> literally

00:02:21.729 --> 00:02:21.739 
because it does look great on literally

because it does look great on literally
any<00:02:21.950> vehicle<00:02:22.340> so<00:02:22.910> as<00:02:22.940> you<00:02:23.060> see<00:02:23.209> when<00:02:23.360> I<00:02:23.390> pull<00:02:23.600> on

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:23.630 
any vehicle so as you see when I pull on

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:25.420 
any vehicle so as you see when I pull on
the<00:02:23.810> Sun<00:02:24.019> it<00:02:24.200> changes<00:02:24.590> from<00:02:24.680> a<00:02:24.860> pink<00:02:25.190> and

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:25.430 
the Sun it changes from a pink and

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:27.280 
the Sun it changes from a pink and
purple<00:02:25.820> color<00:02:26.030> and<00:02:26.299> this<00:02:26.690> goes<00:02:26.900> back<00:02:26.930> and

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:27.290 
purple color and this goes back and

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:28.660 
purple color and this goes back and
forth<00:02:27.500> and<00:02:27.709> it<00:02:27.799> pretty<00:02:27.920> much<00:02:28.010> depends

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:28.670 
forth and it pretty much depends

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:30.340 
forth and it pretty much depends
obviously<00:02:28.850> on<00:02:29.180> the<00:02:29.420> way<00:02:29.540> the<00:02:29.750> light<00:02:29.989> hits<00:02:30.200> off

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:30.350 
obviously on the way the light hits off

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:31.780 
obviously on the way the light hits off
of<00:02:30.470> it<00:02:30.620> so<00:02:30.769> if<00:02:31.070> you<00:02:31.160> look<00:02:31.340> around<00:02:31.459> in<00:02:31.700> the

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:31.790 
of it so if you look around in the

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:33.130 
of it so if you look around in the
circle<00:02:32.030> which<00:02:32.299> I<00:02:32.390> actually<00:02:32.450> unfortunately<00:02:32.750> do

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:33.140 
circle which I actually unfortunately do

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:35.050 
circle which I actually unfortunately do
not<00:02:33.320> show<00:02:33.560> it<00:02:33.799> will<00:02:34.220> be<00:02:34.340> changing<00:02:34.700> colors<00:02:35.030> and

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:35.060
