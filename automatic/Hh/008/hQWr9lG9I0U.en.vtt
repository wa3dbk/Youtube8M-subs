between the two red lines here about
9,000<00:00:23.070> and<00:00:23.160> that<00:00:23.820> looks<00:00:24.000> good<00:00:24.269> and<00:00:24.619> with<00:00:25.619> both

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:25.800 
9,000 and that looks good and with both

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:28.419 
9,000 and that looks good and with both
engines<00:00:26.279> up<00:00:26.519> and<00:00:26.609> running<00:00:26.939> fully<00:00:27.180> now<00:00:27.420> the

00:00:28.419 --> 00:00:28.429 
engines up and running fully now the

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:30.740 
engines up and running fully now the
shaft<00:00:29.429> is<00:00:29.730> actually<00:00:30.060> turning<00:00:30.269> the<00:00:30.660> air

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:30.750 
shaft is actually turning the air

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:33.380 
shaft is actually turning the air
generators<00:00:31.130> there's<00:00:32.130> a<00:00:32.219> Supply<00:00:33.030> electrical

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390 
generators there's a Supply electrical

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:36.650 
generators there's a Supply electrical
power<00:00:33.960> to<00:00:34.110> the<00:00:34.380> haunt<00:00:35.190> word<00:00:35.430> batteries<00:00:36.090> so<00:00:36.540> we

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:36.660 
power to the haunt word batteries so we

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:38.270 
power to the haunt word batteries so we
can<00:00:36.780> go<00:00:36.930> ahead<00:00:37.020> and<00:00:37.170> enable<00:00:37.649> the<00:00:37.890> batteries

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.280 
can go ahead and enable the batteries

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:40.729 
can go ahead and enable the batteries
and<00:00:38.840> with<00:00:39.840> that<00:00:39.989> we<00:00:40.200> can<00:00:40.290> go<00:00:40.469> ahead<00:00:40.559> and

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:40.739 
and with that we can go ahead and

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:44.330 
and with that we can go ahead and
disable<00:00:41.420> external<00:00:42.420> power<00:00:42.860> what<00:00:43.860> you<00:00:43.980> just<00:00:44.129> did

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:44.340 
disable external power what you just did

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:46.610 
disable external power what you just did
so<00:00:44.910> this<00:00:45.090> one<00:00:45.300> now<00:00:45.450> we're<00:00:45.629> operating<00:00:45.930> fully<00:00:46.350> on

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620 
so this one now we're operating fully on

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:50.479 
so this one now we're operating fully on
internal<00:00:47.309> other<00:00:47.460> electrical<00:00:48.270> power<00:00:48.510> and<00:00:49.489> that

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
internal other electrical power and that

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:51.740 
internal other electrical power and that
being<00:00:50.730> said<00:00:50.969> we'll<00:00:51.149> go<00:00:51.270> ahead<00:00:51.329> and<00:00:51.449> get<00:00:51.600> so

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
being said we'll go ahead and get so

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:53.720 
being said we'll go ahead and get so
logical<00:00:52.079> systems<00:00:52.410> up<00:00:52.530> and<00:00:52.590> running<00:00:52.680> so<00:00:53.460> first

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
logical systems up and running so first

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:54.770 
logical systems up and running so first
thing<00:00:53.850> we'll<00:00:53.940> do<00:00:54.059> is<00:00:54.090> we'll<00:00:54.360> go<00:00:54.510> ahead<00:00:54.600> and

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
thing we'll do is we'll go ahead and

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:58.849 
thing we'll do is we'll go ahead and

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:21.390 
first Waypoint and come back go to math

cement a little bit that can have I

00:04:24.790 --> 00:04:27.210 
cement a little bit that can have I
usually<00:04:25.330> go<00:04:25.600> any<00:04:25.780> our<00:04:26.020> commode<00:04:26.320> but<00:04:27.040> again

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:27.220 
usually go any our commode but again

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:28.320 
usually go any our commode but again
we'll<00:04:27.280> take<00:04:27.460> a<00:04:27.490> closer<00:04:27.700> look<00:04:27.820> at<00:04:28.000> the<00:04:28.090> a<00:04:28.120> worse

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:28.330 
we'll take a closer look at the a worse

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:31.650 
we'll take a closer look at the a worse
at<00:04:28.480> a<00:04:28.510> later<00:04:28.750> time<00:04:29.190> go<00:04:30.190> ahead<00:04:30.340> and<00:04:30.520> uncage<00:04:31.000> it

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:31.660 
at a later time go ahead and uncage it

00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:34.410 
at a later time go ahead and uncage it
standby<00:04:32.020> indicator<00:04:32.530> and<00:04:32.970> just<00:04:33.970> that<00:04:34.180> a<00:04:34.210> little

00:04:34.410 --> 00:04:34.420 
standby indicator and just that a little

00:04:34.420 --> 00:04:37.680 
standby indicator and just that a little
bit<00:04:34.540> and<00:04:35.020> then<00:04:35.320> coming<00:04:35.740> back<00:04:35.770> to<00:04:36.280> the<00:04:36.700> ad<00:04:37.450> I'll

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:37.690 
bit and then coming back to the ad I'll

00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:40.820 
bit and then coming back to the ad I'll
go<00:04:38.110> ahead<00:04:38.200> and<00:04:38.320> just<00:04:38.590> add<00:04:38.800> a<00:04:38.830> little<00:04:39.010> bit<00:04:39.130> too

00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:40.830 
go ahead and just add a little bit too

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:45.629 
go ahead and just add a little bit too
quick<00:04:41.830> test

00:04:48.570 --> 00:04:48.580 
and it looks good over here we can set

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:51.270 
and it looks good over here we can set
the<00:04:48.900> warning<00:04:49.900> altitude<00:04:50.379> for<00:04:50.560> the<00:04:50.650> radar<00:04:50.860> I'll

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:51.280 
the warning altitude for the radar I'll

00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:54.779 
the warning altitude for the radar I'll
