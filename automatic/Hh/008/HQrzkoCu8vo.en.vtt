00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:14.880
 Hello people, welcome again, what is it? 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:18.180
 our channel fitch this whole life project 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:21.150
 today has no prescription in the month of training is 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:24.810
 a video of a hint a different way 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:27.630
 agent to pick up the egg yolk in 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:30.300
 separate course is ideal for those who do not 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:33.390
 like how I do not like the gem much 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:36.420
 because the taste is too strong or too 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:39.780
 diets are used more often than 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:44.100
 clear as personal transport praxe 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:46.170
 with a grin to practice an end to the 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:49.710
 other sports and makes a diet more 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:52.829
 reflect more life with egg consumption 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:56.940
 So for this tip today's time 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:01:03.660
 if you use egg dish 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:06.229
 another dish is a 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:09.360
 little 

00:01:06.229 --> 00:01:12.390
 and it only depends on what you 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:15.150
 find ready to see our tip 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:20.310
 different from how to take the egg yolk 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:22.530
 in the face you're super simple and easy I 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:24.420
 I will teach you'll say anything just 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:26.960
 I was trying to make a little noise because 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:29.280
 You have to press her to let the air out. 

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:31.590
 pick up gem here 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:34.619
 There you raise the loose bottle. 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:37.650
 the air from the bottle and slowly pours in 

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:40.650
 I'll make another plate for you there. 

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:45.439
 You could not identify what I 

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:45.439
 I said coercion that I'm going to do now 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:02:05.010
 It's now you're coming back. 

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:07.340
 jorginho own gm now will get on 

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:07.340
 blue 

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:21.300
 You pick the top pick in the bottle. 

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:23.550
 I slowly and as I know it has 

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:28.200
 other ways you can take one of the 

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:42.030
 cameras for example not everyone knows 

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:42.870
 the milk egg, for example what is 

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:46.230
 Speaking 

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:50.220
 not everyone knows how to break the egg and 

00:02:46.230 --> 00:03:00.810
 separate the whites on hand even without 

00:02:50.220 --> 00:03:03.450
 sense not only by making the flame 

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:05.220
 explain something to you guys have that 

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:09.510
 There are people for example. 

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:12.150
 My grandmother knows how to break the will. 

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:14.820
 Egg shell breaks a little by hand 

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:16.739
 in her so that she is doing so and there 

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:20.100
 that will occur on the plate is clear that 

00:03:16.739 --> 00:03:22.769
 left over is the house that the gem she keeps 

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:25.530
 plays out has this mode but for example 

00:03:22.769 --> 00:03:27.660
 I can, my mother can not do it any more 

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:30.720
 so who can not do the modes 

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:32.100
 that conventional bikes already exist 

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:35.310
 to do it this way because simple 

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:37.380
 already applying to fifa so you 

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:41.820
 do not want to waste the urn will be in 

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:44.480
 everything make a boat and cute like that 

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:47.730
 know how to separate right 

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:50.160
 now if you went to make a plate some 

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:52.920
 recipe only uses egg whites 

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:54.720
 there you will leave your gems here is that 

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:55.410
 I do with the gems I will not use 

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:58.049
 I now 

00:03:55.410 --> 00:04:00.810
 Then we'll teach you what to do. 

00:03:58.049 --> 00:04:02.200
 with the twins to use them later 

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:06.730
 how to do nothing 

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:09.730
 use it later I brought it here for you guys 

00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:13.480
 the option what to do with us is going 

00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:15.430
 need to be half a bowl or to 

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:17.919
 stay cool this one is square 

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:20.260
 themes ice cubes in 

00:04:17.919 --> 00:04:23.260
 all the information from 

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:25.210
 Find polka dots in smaller stores 

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:28.030
 these condemnations because the gems will 

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:30.190
 stay in the shape of a ball right here 

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:33.430
 It's a little square here, I'll show you 

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:41.610
 For you, how do I stay because I already had 

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:44.860
 done here is the result of our 

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:47.580
 storage of those of the twins I already 

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:51.760
 had an area 

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:54.220
 Now I'll get you some gems here. 

00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:56.620
 You want to pick it up with the bottle. 

00:04:54.220 --> 00:04:59.050
 Similarly same I hit or caught 

00:04:56.620 --> 00:05:04.090
 a tablespoon of the stone comes close 

00:04:59.050 --> 00:05:05.620
 will only placing the caches that only 

00:05:04.090 --> 00:05:14.100
 Do you want to be excited about the 

00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:14.100
 bottle is also fun underneath 

00:05:20.830 --> 00:05:28.780
 And there you go by how many gems you 

00:05:25.900 --> 00:05:32.470
 do you want in your family here how much you 

00:05:28.780 --> 00:05:34.900
 use your recipe on the gems this 

00:05:32.470 --> 00:05:36.580
 It's just recipe, do not use yolk. 

00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:39.700
 not use the phone book is in the 

00:05:36.580 --> 00:05:42.250
 moment when you throw away the 

00:05:39.700 --> 00:05:43.300
 your mini sheet freezes the 

00:05:42.250 --> 00:05:45.010
 freezing 

00:05:43.300 --> 00:05:48.550
 it does the properties of the 

00:05:45.010 --> 00:05:51.790
 food and leaves for much longer 

00:05:48.550 --> 00:05:54.340
 I see up to a month on average three months 

00:05:51.790 --> 00:05:56.920
 two frozen foods 

00:05:54.340 --> 00:05:59.380
 the average writer was the most elements 

00:05:56.920 --> 00:06:02.200
 which lasted less but normally when 

00:05:59.380 --> 00:06:04.720
 he does the old ones nevertheless it lasts until 

00:06:02.200 --> 00:06:06.490
 even from here one week of the week you 

00:06:04.720 --> 00:06:07.690
 end up freezing count goes to other 

00:06:06.490 --> 00:06:12.640

00:06:20.860 --> 00:06:24.730
 everyone speaks in the same way who does not 

00:06:22.900 --> 00:06:26.830
 You know how to do this so that everyone does 

00:06:24.730 --> 00:06:29.170
