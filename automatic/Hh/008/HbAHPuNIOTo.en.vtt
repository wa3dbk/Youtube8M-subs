00:00:01.100 --> 00:00:07.940
 greet you friends today 

00:00:03.410 --> 00:00:11.759
 prepare such a delicious recipe 

00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:14.549
 pretty fast simple but very 

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:19.289
 tasty mimosa roll 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:23.750
 at the core of it is kind of cynical in 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:25.920
 which we will roll up the mimosa salad 

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:29.010
 means for this we need 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:32.850
 wheat roll can be used and 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:35.960
 Armenian lavash is more convenient 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:37.230
 see the cooking process yourself 

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:42.180
 bank 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:44.239
 fish is not important that there was saury 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:47.960
 maybe any tasty 

00:00:44.239 --> 00:00:52.579
 canned fish to your taste 

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:56.820
 4 eggs pre boiled hard and 

00:00:52.579 --> 00:00:57.360
 cleaned greens greens can also be 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:00.870
 any 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:03.589
 on which you like mayonnaise 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:05.760
 need a provencal 

00:01:03.589 --> 00:01:08.570
 again to your taste 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:14.130
 maybe I'm wrong and not provencal and 

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:19.310
 300 grams of cheese let's cook first 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:26.119
 Spread the fish in a separate plate 

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:26.119
 then clean the bones and then it at once 

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:50.820
 cut greens 

00:01:53.039 --> 00:02:05.530
 we rub the cheese on a coarse grater in the same way 

00:02:01.899 --> 00:02:08.009
 way but a large grater rub all 4 

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:08.009
 eggs 

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:29.310
 divide rock by 3 

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:31.470
 preferably equal parts of cellophane 

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:46.260
 touched need to use what not 

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:48.379
 soak the table 1 bis 

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:48.379
 mayonnaise 

00:02:56.590 --> 00:03:04.180
 they need just enough to 

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:09.250
 thick layer and I had enough to smudge on 

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:12.190
 all if again this is all a matter of taste 

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:12.640
 someone loves a lot of mayonnaise can be put 

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:19.239
 and 

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:27.040
 on fat and on the first layer exactly 

00:03:19.239 --> 00:03:34.690
 we lay the egg master then I gently 

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:37.209
 distributed over the entire surface we take 

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:43.079
 a little bit green about a third of 

00:03:37.209 --> 00:03:43.079
 cut and sprinkle on top 

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:50.440
 the land must be so distributed so that it is on 

00:03:47.319 --> 00:03:53.340
 as if all three sheets were covered 

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:53.340
 take the third part 

00:03:58.670 --> 00:04:03.550
 now neatly fold all 

00:04:00.770 --> 00:04:03.550
 ledge point 

00:04:20.299 --> 00:04:28.539
 the second layer is also smeared with mayonnaise on 

00:04:25.159 --> 00:04:28.539
 this layer we have fish 

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:53.850
 sprinkle with herbs as well take the first 

00:04:46.230 --> 00:04:57.140
 part of the roll with the egg put on top 

00:04:53.850 --> 00:04:57.140
 Cutter Tver 

00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:34.280
 put the side of the third part 

00:05:23.730 --> 00:05:39.200
 and the final procedure is also mayonnaise 

00:05:34.280 --> 00:05:39.200
 cheese and greens 

00:05:44.770 --> 00:05:52.270
 pour out the cheese in general can make it not 

00:05:50.330 --> 00:05:55.340
 form of a roll see . 

00:05:52.270 --> 00:05:58.880
 the filling can also be absolutely any 

00:05:55.340 --> 00:06:02.030
 that is, you can dream it here 

00:05:58.880 --> 00:06:04.990
 can crab sticks it can be 

00:06:02.030 --> 00:06:04.990
 grated sausage 

00:06:07.270 --> 00:06:11.800
 Sprinkle with remaining vision and on top. 

00:06:17.820 --> 00:06:26.330
 repeat all the same twirl 

00:06:26.450 --> 00:06:35.060
 final layer 3 you walk 

00:06:30.750 --> 00:06:39.180
 almost ready now twirl 

00:06:35.060 --> 00:06:41.690
 you can put it in cellophane in a package 

00:06:39.180 --> 00:06:51.810
 either here we are in the same package 

00:06:41.690 --> 00:06:55.100
 the rock is sealed it is packed up 

00:06:51.810 --> 00:06:55.100
 fridge for a couple of hours 

00:06:55.840 --> 00:06:59.820
 advice in the evening is done but it was night 

00:06:58.080 --> 00:07:04.290
 soaked 

00:06:59.820 --> 00:07:07.050

00:07:04.290 --> 00:07:10.979
 mimosa roll 

00:07:07.050 --> 00:07:15.120
 as a result we get this 

00:07:10.979 --> 00:07:20.620
 delicious rolls stood for the whole night 

00:07:15.120 --> 00:07:21.190

00:07:21.190 --> 00:07:26.910
 it turns out that's such a delicious beauty 

00:07:27.360 --> 00:07:32.110
 cook 

00:07:29.130 --> 00:07:37.360
 room for imagination any ingredients 

00:07:32.110 --> 00:07:42.030

00:07:37.360 --> 00:07:47.880
