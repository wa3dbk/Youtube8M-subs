 where vitesse just return 

00:03:15.029 --> 00:03:16.209
 because he is a real one 

00:03:16.209 --> 00:03:19.209
 nine players this year 

00:03:23.939 --> 00:03:27.419
 he says vitesse 

00:03:27.419 --> 00:03:29.059
 what a bad first half 

00:03:29.059 --> 00:03:32.229
 for the team neither of them has left here on the ground 

00:03:35.239 --> 00:03:38.629
 is also evident from the lives of the eight best players 

00:03:39.959 --> 00:03:42.959
 that wasn't even on purpose 

00:03:44.859 --> 00:03:46.079
 Nothing is sure 

00:03:46.079 --> 00:03:49.079
 then it takes even longer 

00:03:50.039 --> 00:03:53.039
 but the reason for the 

00:04:05.869 --> 00:04:08.869
 well the new one 

00:04:11.689 --> 00:04:14.689
 more than three thousand people 

00:04:15.619 --> 00:04:18.619
 but the minister 

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:26.370
 advantage is that we 

00:04:28.249 --> 00:04:30.240
 8 hence the price 

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:33.240
 radomski 

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:35.749
 beaten the store 

00:04:35.749 --> 00:04:37.590
 no more than one hundred percent 

00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:40.319
 which caused the fire

 dalibor stevanovic 

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:55.330
 what a spokesperson for this 

00:04:57.300 --> 00:05:00.300
 take a seat 

00:05:06.789 --> 00:05:07.689
 david 

00:05:07.689 --> 00:05:09.909
 whoever shoots 

00:05:09.909 --> 00:05:12.120
 ball is touched by and then 

00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:15.120
 the fingertips of field houses and the ball 

00:05:22.479 --> 00:05:24.979
 take with questions 

00:05:24.979 --> 00:05:27.800
 that happened 9 

00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:30.800
 for nothing 

00:05:31.610 --> 00:05:34.610
 taking the fire department 

00:05:53.339 --> 00:05:56.830
 it excellent in the film 

00:05:56.830 --> 00:05:59.580
 and in the sea but it is very small number 

00:05:59.580 --> 00:06:02.680
 the one-year contract 

00:06:02.680 --> 00:06:05.680
 the only problem was not playing 

00:06:07.419 --> 00:06:09.770
 and it gets even more exciting in the gelderlander 

00:06:09.770 --> 00:06:12.439
 it is the ball possession 

00:06:12.439 --> 00:06:15.219
 of training courses 

00:06:15.219 --> 00:06:17.499
 at the peak of Sunday 

00:06:17.499 --> 00:06:20.499
 now it's again 

00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:30.449
 by the red light 

00:06:30.449 --> 00:06:32.689
 sailor in the front with a win 

00:06:32.689 --> 00:06:35.689
 unbelieveable 

00:06:45.749 --> 00:06:48.749
 in injury time that is nonsense 

00:06:49.699 --> 00:06:52.699
 van der Struijk 

00:06:54.369 --> 00:06:57.699
 and it is thanks 

00:06:57.699 --> 00:07:00.699
 meet on the training field according to director 

00:07:01.479 --> 00:07:04.479
 he is still right for a muscle injury time 

00:07:08.039 --> 00:07:11.039
 how is this possible 

00:07:11.699 --> 00:07:14.919
 I don't think so 

00:07:14.919 --> 00:07:17.369
 the bronze went to the equalizer in disappointment 

00:07:17.369 --> 00:07:18.960
 at vitesse 

00:07:18.960 --> 00:07:20.979
 we are offering the same industry 

00:07:20.979 --> 00:07:23.979
 2 2 plays a role in the project 

00:07:27.119 --> 00:07:30.299
 thirteen minutes ahead of time the 2 0 lead and yet the victory 

00:07:30.299 --> 00:07:32.199
 have to give up 

00:07:32.199 --> 00:07:35.180
 the disappointment is great except for discussion 

00:07:35.180 --> 00:07:37.499
 this is unbelievable 

00:07:37.499 --> 00:07:40.499
 since then the numbers have been playing five and six minutes 

00:07:41.379 --> 00:07:44.159
 do you know what they do 

00:07:44.159 --> 00:07:45.610
 one of that man 

00:07:45.610 --> 00:07:47.529
 to find someone who throws that 

00:07:47.529 --> 00:07:48.779
 looks like competition 

00:07:48.779 --> 00:07:52.360
 that the police have not heard anything in his columns is harder to 

00:07:52.359 --> 00:07:55.059
 divide our players walk the ping route 

00:07:55.059 --> 00:07:58.059
 There are two goals to laugh at this region 

00:07:58.889 --> 00:08:00.169
 that's a great one 

00:08:00.169 --> 00:08:02.780
 and the competition is only five rounds hundreds
