00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:48.920 
water running down like that because

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:53.380 
water running down like that because
some<00:02:49.610> reason<00:02:50.150> now<00:02:50.930> his<00:02:50.959> tip<00:02:51.700> you<00:02:52.700> can't<00:02:53.030> have

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:53.390 
some reason now his tip you can't have

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:58.870 
some reason now his tip you can't have
water<00:02:53.810> running<00:02:54.620> underneath<00:02:55.390> here<00:02:57.070> too<00:02:58.070> as<00:02:58.700> you
