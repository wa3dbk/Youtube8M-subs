00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:30.060 
cable and did you hear how I just took

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:31.490 
cable and did you hear how I just took
it<00:00:30.210> out<00:00:30.390> of<00:00:30.539> the<00:00:30.570> base<00:00:30.810> you<00:00:31.019> didn't<00:00:31.230> hear<00:00:31.349> any

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:31.500 
it out of the base you didn't hear any

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:33.500 
it out of the base you didn't hear any
pops<00:00:31.769> or<00:00:32.009> clicks<00:00:32.250> or<00:00:32.369> anything<00:00:32.579> yeah

pops or clicks or anything yeah

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:35.720 
pops or clicks or anything yeah
there's<00:00:33.960> a<00:00:34.020> little<00:00:34.230> volume<00:00:34.380> knob<00:00:34.770> passive

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:35.730 
there's a little volume knob passive

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:39.709 
there's a little volume knob passive
volume<00:00:36.450> knob<00:00:36.690> just<00:00:37.410> built<00:00:37.649> into<00:00:38.100> this<00:00:38.719> right

00:00:39.709 --> 00:00:39.719 
volume knob just built into this right

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:41.600 
volume knob just built into this right
angle<00:00:40.079> plug<00:00:40.110> at<00:00:40.559> the<00:00:40.590> end<00:00:40.770> of<00:00:40.890> this<00:00:40.980> cable<00:00:41.219> it's

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:41.610 
angle plug at the end of this cable it's

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:43.790 
angle plug at the end of this cable it's
a<00:00:41.640> very<00:00:41.820> simple<00:00:42.420> elegant<00:00:42.840> little<00:00:43.230> design<00:00:43.530> that

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:43.800 
a very simple elegant little design that

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:46.520 
a very simple elegant little design that
solves<00:00:44.340> a<00:00:44.460> huge<00:00:45.180> number<00:00:45.360> of<00:00:45.539> problems<00:00:46.140> so

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
solves a huge number of problems so

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:48.049 
solves a huge number of problems so
you'll<00:00:46.680> notice<00:00:46.829> that<00:00:46.980> this<00:00:47.190> guy<00:00:47.340> says<00:00:47.579> Taylor

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059 
you'll notice that this guy says Taylor

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:50.569 
you'll notice that this guy says Taylor
on<00:00:48.600> the<00:00:49.170> plug<00:00:49.410> here<00:00:49.649> right<00:00:49.860> below<00:00:50.039> the<00:00:50.370> knob

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:50.579 
on the plug here right below the knob

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:53.060 
on the plug here right below the knob
and<00:00:51.480> that's<00:00:51.690> because<00:00:52.140> the<00:00:52.410> V<00:00:52.620> cable<00:00:52.920> was

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070 
and that's because the V cable was

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:55.610 
and that's because the V cable was
designed<00:00:53.579> as<00:00:54.570> a<00:00:54.870> joint<00:00:55.140> project<00:00:55.590> between

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:55.620 
designed as a joint project between

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:58.160 
designed as a joint project between
Taylor<00:00:56.160> guitars<00:00:56.520> and<00:00:56.789> rap<00:00:57.449> Co<00:00:57.660> horizon

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
Taylor guitars and rap Co horizon

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:00.189 
Taylor guitars and rap Co horizon
because<00:00:58.649> Taylor<00:00:58.920> wanted<00:00:59.489> to<00:00:59.550> introduce<00:00:59.820> a

00:01:00.189 --> 00:01:00.199 
because Taylor wanted to introduce a

00:01:00.199 --> 00:01:03.170 
because Taylor wanted to introduce a
basically<00:01:01.199> a<00:01:01.260> simple<00:01:02.250> solution<00:01:02.640> to<00:01:02.879> their

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
basically a simple solution to their

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:06.260 
basically a simple solution to their
guitars<00:01:03.600> that<00:01:04.260> have<00:01:04.320> no<00:01:05.159> master<00:01:05.549> volume<00:01:05.970> like

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
guitars that have no master volume like

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:09.109 
guitars that have no master volume like
guitars<00:01:06.570> with<00:01:06.720> the<00:01:06.950> yeah<00:01:07.950> the<00:01:08.400> es<00:01:08.610> expression

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:09.119 
guitars with the yeah the es expression

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:11.690 
guitars with the yeah the es expression
system<00:01:09.570> or<00:01:09.750> guitars<00:01:10.590> like<00:01:10.740> the<00:01:10.830> t5<00:01:11.220> which<00:01:11.490> have

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
system or guitars like the t5 which have

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:15.590 
system or guitars like the t5 which have
both<00:01:12.180> magnetic<00:01:12.869> and<00:01:13.170> piezo<00:01:13.950> pickups<00:01:14.400> and<00:01:15.270> this

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
both magnetic and piezo pickups and this

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:17.570 
both magnetic and piezo pickups and this
was<00:01:15.840> basically<00:01:16.380> just<00:01:16.470> a<00:01:16.890> really<00:01:17.400> simple

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
was basically just a really simple

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:20.030 
was basically just a really simple
solution<00:01:17.880> to<00:01:18.450> adding<00:01:19.140> a<00:01:19.200> master<00:01:19.619> volume<00:01:19.770> a

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:20.040 
solution to adding a master volume a

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:22.460 
solution to adding a master volume a
passive<00:01:20.460> master<00:01:20.790> volume<00:01:21.119> to<00:01:21.240> your<00:01:21.330> guitar<00:01:21.600> it

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470 
passive master volume to your guitar it

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:24.380 
passive master volume to your guitar it
also<00:01:22.590> effects<00:01:22.950> effectively<00:01:23.670> mutes<00:01:23.880> the<00:01:24.000> cable

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
also effects effectively mutes the cable

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:26.510 
also effects effectively mutes the cable
so<00:01:24.540> you<00:01:24.570> can<00:01:24.770> facilitates<00:01:25.770> quick<00:01:25.979> guitar

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
so you can facilitates quick guitar

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:29.780 
so you can facilitates quick guitar
changes<00:01:27.030> but<00:01:27.840> really<00:01:28.560> it's<00:01:29.100> a<00:01:29.220> great<00:01:29.340> solution

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:29.790 
changes but really it's a great solution

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:31.700 
changes but really it's a great solution
for<00:01:29.820> any<00:01:30.509> instrument<00:01:31.170> that<00:01:31.229> doesn't<00:01:31.560> already

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
for any instrument that doesn't already

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:34.460 
for any instrument that doesn't already

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
have a single master volume pot it comes

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:38.420 
have a single master volume pot it comes
in<00:01:34.619> two<00:01:34.860> flavors<00:01:35.240> this<00:01:36.240> version<00:01:37.020> has<00:01:37.470> a<00:01:37.500> 250<00:01:38.220> K

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.430 
in two flavors this version has a 250 K

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:42.109 
in two flavors this version has a 250 K
ohm<00:01:38.700> resistor<00:01:39.390> for<00:01:39.659> its<00:01:39.900> volume<00:01:40.590> pot<00:01:40.799> and<00:01:41.700> it's

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:54.479 
suited to base and humbucking guitar but

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:57.230 
suited to base and humbucking guitar but

pickup<00:02:06.689> it's<00:02:06.899> the<00:02:07.049> same<00:02:07.259> with<00:02:07.530> a<00:02:07.770> Les<00:02:08.220> Paul<00:02:08.250> a

00:02:09.199 --> 00:02:09.209 
pickup it's the same with a Les Paul a

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:10.760 
pickup it's the same with a Les Paul a
lot<00:02:09.629> of<00:02:09.690> different<00:02:10.050> guitars<00:02:10.319> have<00:02:10.590> that

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:10.770 
lot of different guitars have that

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:12.890 
lot of different guitars have that
arrangement<00:02:11.220> and<00:02:11.400> I<00:02:12.030> don't<00:02:12.150> like<00:02:12.420> having<00:02:12.690> a

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:12.900 
arrangement and I don't like having a

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:13.880 
arrangement and I don't like having a
volume<00:02:13.260> pedal

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:13.890 
volume pedal

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:16.100 
volume pedal
because<00:02:14.280> I<00:02:14.490> play<00:02:15.090> bass<00:02:15.300> and<00:02:15.330> I<00:02:15.660> don't<00:02:15.930> really

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:16.110 
because I play bass and I don't really

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:18.400 
because I play bass and I don't really
have<00:02:16.320> any<00:02:16.470> other<00:02:16.620> pedals<00:02:16.920> other<00:02:17.610> than<00:02:17.850> a<00:02:17.880> tuner

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:18.410 
have any other pedals other than a tuner

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:21.790 
have any other pedals other than a tuner
so<00:02:19.410> this<00:02:19.650> is<00:02:19.860> a<00:02:19.980> really<00:02:20.370> nice<00:02:20.580> solution

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:21.800 
so this is a really nice solution

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:24.290 
so this is a really nice solution
alternative<00:02:22.800> to<00:02:22.980> having<00:02:23.490> to<00:02:23.610> bring<00:02:23.850> a<00:02:23.970> pedal

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:24.300 
alternative to having to bring a pedal

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:25.610 
alternative to having to bring a pedal
and<00:02:24.360> an<00:02:24.480> extra<00:02:24.750> cable<00:02:24.990> and<00:02:25.230> a<00:02:25.290> power<00:02:25.470> supply

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:25.620 
and an extra cable and a power supply

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:29.300 
and an extra cable and a power supply
and<00:02:26.040> by<00:02:26.580> the<00:02:26.640> lullaby<00:02:26.940> plus<00:02:27.810> it<00:02:28.650> lets<00:02:28.890> me

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:29.310 
and by the lullaby plus it lets me

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:31.880 
and by the lullaby plus it lets me
finally<00:02:29.700> have<00:02:30.000> fun<00:02:30.210> doing<00:02:30.390> silly<00:02:30.930> delay<00:02:31.560> swell

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:31.890 
finally have fun doing silly delay swell

00:02:31.890 --> 00:03:12.080 
finally have fun doing silly delay swell
stuff

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:12.090 

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:15.300 

anyway<00:03:13.090> you<00:03:13.150> get<00:03:13.300> the<00:03:13.360> idea<00:03:13.450> so<00:03:13.930> that<00:03:14.650> is<00:03:15.099> the

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:15.310 
anyway you get the idea so that is the

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:18.300 
anyway you get the idea so that is the
it's<00:03:16.060> the<00:03:16.209> Ratko<00:03:16.629> horizon<00:03:17.140> V<00:03:17.500> cable<00:03:17.920> it's

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:18.310 
it's the Ratko horizon V cable it's

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:20.729 
it's the Ratko horizon V cable it's
really<00:03:18.610> well<00:03:18.730> constructed<00:03:19.269> the<00:03:19.450> the<00:03:20.019> pot<00:03:20.410> is<00:03:20.709> a

00:03:20.729 --> 00:03:20.739 
really well constructed the the pot is a

00:03:20.739 --> 00:03:24.570 
really well constructed the the pot is a
it's<00:03:21.280> a<00:03:21.550> very<00:03:21.730> organic<00:03:21.910> taper<00:03:22.629> and<00:03:23.099> it<00:03:24.099> really

00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:24.580 
it's a very organic taper and it really

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:26.580 
it's a very organic taper and it really
smooth<00:03:24.879> action<00:03:25.209> just<00:03:26.170> sort<00:03:26.440> of<00:03:26.500> a

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:26.590 
smooth action just sort of a

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:29.460 
smooth action just sort of a

for<00:03:32.470> about<00:03:32.709> 40<00:03:33.370> dollars<00:03:33.489> so<00:03:34.060> it's<00:03:34.180> not

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:34.300 
for about 40 dollars so it's not

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:36.839 
for about 40 dollars so it's not
terribly<00:03:34.690> expensive<00:03:34.900> it's<00:03:35.620> a<00:03:35.680> really<00:03:36.400> simple
