00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:14.520 
the grand theft auto 5 world I believe

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:17.000 
the grand theft auto 5 world I believe
it<00:02:14.670> deserves<00:02:15.060> a<00:02:15.209> spot<00:02:15.450> because<00:02:15.690> it<00:02:16.010> designed

the<00:02:17.360> design<00:02:18.360> of<00:02:18.390> the<00:02:18.569> car<00:02:18.930> itself<00:02:19.349> deserves<00:02:19.890> to

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:20.010 
the design of the car itself deserves to

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:21.920 
the design of the car itself deserves to
be<00:02:20.099> in<00:02:20.129> a<00:02:20.280> game<00:02:20.549> and<00:02:20.790> I<00:02:21.209> believe<00:02:21.480> this<00:02:21.659> car

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:21.930 
be in a game and I believe this car

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:23.720 
be in a game and I believe this car
would<00:02:22.620> fit<00:02:22.920> well<00:02:23.099> and<00:02:23.159> grant
