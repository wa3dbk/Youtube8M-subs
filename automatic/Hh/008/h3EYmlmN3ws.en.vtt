this<00:00:20.460> week<00:00:20.699> this<00:00:20.939> year<00:00:21.000> how<00:00:21.390> loose<00:00:21.960> they<00:00:22.230> are

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:22.380 
this week this year how loose they are

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:23.840 
this week this year how loose they are
within<00:00:22.800> their<00:00:23.010> little<00:00:23.250> slots<00:00:23.519> um<00:00:23.670> you<00:00:23.789> know

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:23.850 
within their little slots um you know

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:24.950 
within their little slots um you know
all<00:00:23.910> you<00:00:23.970> got<00:00:24.090> to<00:00:24.150> do<00:00:24.210> is<00:00:24.330> flick<00:00:24.539> it<00:00:24.660> once<00:00:24.810> and

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:24.960 
all you got to do is flick it once and

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:27.580 
all you got to do is flick it once and
everything<00:00:25.260> flies<00:00:25.650> absolutely<00:00:26.400> everywhere

00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:27.590 
everything flies absolutely everywhere

00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:30.529 
everything flies absolutely everywhere
so<00:00:28.590> you<00:00:28.680> can<00:00:28.769> change<00:00:29.220> that<00:00:29.400> focus<00:00:30.119> a<00:00:30.150> little

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:30.539 
so you can change that focus a little

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:37.670 
so you can change that focus a little
bit<00:00:30.720> a<00:00:32.750> bit<00:00:33.750> better<00:00:36.079> yeah<00:00:37.079> not<00:00:37.320> too<00:00:37.469> bad<00:00:37.500> I

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:37.680 
bit a bit better yeah not too bad I

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:39.979

the<00:00:57.690> badges<00:00:57.960> I<00:00:58.050> wish<00:00:58.230> I<00:00:58.289> do<00:00:58.440> the<00:00:58.559> badges<00:00:58.859> and

00:00:58.939 --> 00:00:58.949 
the badges I wish I do the badges and

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:01.549 
the badges I wish I do the badges and
the<00:00:59.100> stadiums<00:00:59.609> and<00:01:00.000> managers<00:01:00.989> which<00:01:01.170> one<00:01:01.469> of

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559 
the stadiums and managers which one of

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:03.770 
the stadiums and managers which one of
the<00:01:01.620> managers<00:01:01.949> this<00:01:02.100> year<00:01:02.390> so<00:01:03.390> it<00:01:03.629> would<00:01:03.719> be

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
the managers this year so it would be

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:05.990 
the managers this year so it would be
nice<00:01:03.899> if<00:01:04.019> we<00:01:04.110> had<00:01:04.199> badge<00:01:04.589> stadium<00:01:05.369> manager<00:01:05.519> and

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
nice if we had badge stadium manager and

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.660 
nice if we had badge stadium manager and
then<00:01:06.150> we<00:01:06.270> went<00:01:06.360> into<00:01:06.630> the<00:01:06.780> players<00:01:07.460> so<00:01:08.460> were

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
then we went into the players so were

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:09.980 
then we went into the players so were
maybe<00:01:09.180> a<00:01:09.240> little<00:01:09.330> bit<00:01:09.479> of<00:01:09.570> food<00:01:09.750> for<00:01:09.930> thought

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
maybe a little bit of food for thought

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:11.690 
maybe a little bit of food for thought
if<00:01:10.380> there's<00:01:10.530> any<00:01:10.650> tops<00:01:10.950> representatives

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
if there's any tops representatives

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:16.850 
if there's any tops representatives
watching<00:01:13.040> that<00:01:14.040> probably<00:01:14.340> isn't<00:01:15.650> as<00:01:16.650> you<00:01:16.740> can

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860 
watching that probably isn't as you can

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:19.609 
watching that probably isn't as you can
probably<00:01:17.040> see<00:01:17.340> there<00:01:17.659> it's<00:01:18.659> fairly<00:01:18.960> full<00:01:19.380> now

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:19.619 
probably see there it's fairly full now

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:22.219 
probably see there it's fairly full now
think<00:01:20.340> only<00:01:20.549> needs<00:01:20.820> four<00:01:21.030> more<00:01:21.360> to<00:01:21.630> eat<00:01:21.930> some

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:22.229 
think only needs four more to eat some

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:28.819 
think only needs four more to eat some
land<00:01:22.560> for<00:01:23.450> Swansea<00:01:24.450> for<00:01:25.320> the<00:01:25.530> Tottenham<00:01:27.829> so

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:28.829 
land for Swansea for the Tottenham so

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:30.770 
land for Swansea for the Tottenham so
and<00:01:29.280> then<00:01:29.400> I<00:01:29.640> don't<00:01:30.030> quite<00:01:30.210> what<00:01:30.329> I'm<00:01:30.420> a<00:01:30.450> man<00:01:30.659> of

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 
and then I don't quite what I'm a man of

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:32.920 
and then I don't quite what I'm a man of
the<00:01:30.810> match<00:01:30.990> funds<00:01:31.350> as<00:01:31.560> well

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:36.039 
the match funds as well
not<00:01:33.930> too<00:01:34.200> bad<00:01:34.829> could<00:01:35.070> be<00:01:35.159> a<00:01:35.189> lot<00:01:35.340> worse

00:01:36.039 --> 00:01:36.049 
not too bad could be a lot worse

00:01:36.049 --> 00:01:39.440 
not too bad could be a lot worse
