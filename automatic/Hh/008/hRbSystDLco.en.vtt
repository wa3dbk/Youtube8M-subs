too<00:00:52.110> much<00:00:52.410> until<00:00:52.739> i<00:00:52.770> watch<00:00:52.980> the<00:00:53.129> film<00:00:53.399> I

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760 
too much until i watch the film I

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:56.479 
too much until i watch the film I
thought<00:00:54.420> we<00:00:54.539> protected<00:00:55.050> though<00:00:55.250> pretty<00:00:56.250> well

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
thought we protected though pretty well

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:58.490 
thought we protected though pretty well
until<00:00:57.180> a<00:00:57.239> couple<00:00:57.539> of<00:00:57.690> times<00:00:57.870> in<00:00:58.050> the<00:00:58.109> second

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
until a couple of times in the second

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:01.220 
until a couple of times in the second
half<00:00:58.649> but<00:00:58.949> again<00:00:59.280> we<00:00:59.460> it's<00:01:00.359> hard<00:01:00.629> to<00:01:00.719> hard<00:01:01.079> to

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230 
half but again we it's hard to hard to

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:02.869 
half but again we it's hard to hard to
play<00:01:01.440> when<00:01:01.649> you're<00:01:01.710> behind<00:01:01.890> the<00:01:02.129> chains<00:01:02.430> you

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879 
play when you're behind the chains you

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:04.759 
play when you're behind the chains you
know<00:01:03.059> with<00:01:03.329> so<00:01:03.690> many<00:01:03.809> penalties<00:01:04.110> they<00:01:04.559> did

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
know with so many penalties they did

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:06.410 
know with so many penalties they did
some<00:01:04.979> they<00:01:05.159> were<00:01:05.339> definitely<00:01:05.670> committed<00:01:06.240> to

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
some they were definitely committed to

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:08.660 
some they were definitely committed to
stopping<00:01:06.630> the<00:01:06.810> room<00:01:07.280> they<00:01:08.280> were<00:01:08.340> going<00:01:08.610> to

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
stopping the room they were going to

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:11.359

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:45.710 
an even in his progression but when I'm
on<00:03:44.070> the<00:03:44.100> route<00:03:44.490> and<00:03:44.520> he'll<00:03:45.180> be<00:03:45.300> the<00:03:45.420> first<00:03:45.630> to

00:03:45.710 --> 00:03:45.720 
on the route and he'll be the first to

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:49.100 
on the route and he'll be the first to
take<00:03:45.990> that<00:03:46.200> he<00:03:46.350> knows<00:03:46.560> that<00:03:46.860> and<00:03:47.750> you<00:03:48.750> know<00:03:48.870> so

00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:49.110 
take that he knows that and you know so

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:51.440 
take that he knows that and you know so
it<00:03:49.410> was<00:03:49.530> a<00:03:49.560> bit<00:03:50.460> amazing<00:03:50.940> he<00:03:51.060> was<00:03:51.150> a<00:03:51.210> little<00:03:51.420> out

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:51.450 
it was a bit amazing he was a little out

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:52.910 
it was a bit amazing he was a little out
of<00:03:51.510> sync<00:03:51.780> but<00:03:52.110> I<00:03:52.140> thought<00:03:52.380> he<00:03:52.500> really<00:03:52.620> played

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:52.920 
of sync but I thought he really played

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:56.420 
of sync but I thought he really played
well<00:03:53.100> in<00:03:53.160> the<00:03:53.280> second<00:03:53.610> half<00:03:53.640> sure<00:03:55.430> Hotel

00:03:56.420 --> 00:03:56.430 
well in the second half sure Hotel

00:03:56.430 --> 00:03:58.790 
well in the second half sure Hotel
important<00:03:56.880> were<00:03:57.060> those<00:03:57.270> two<00:03:57.630> stops<00:03:58.020> when<00:03:58.650> they

00:03:58.790 --> 00:03:58.800 
important were those two stops when they

00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:02.030 
important were those two stops when they
got<00:03:59.010> inside<00:03:59.160> the<00:03:59.580> five<00:03:59.820> look<00:04:00.510> like<00:04:00.860> those<00:04:01.860> are

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:02.040 
got inside the five look like those are

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:03.380 
got inside the five look like those are
the<00:04:02.130> points<00:04:02.430> for<00:04:02.520> your<00:04:02.640> defensive<00:04:03.090> lineman

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:03.390 
the points for your defensive lineman

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:04.790 
the points for your defensive lineman

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:04.800
