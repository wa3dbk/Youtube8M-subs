time I like to contour with a bronzer so

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:09.950 
time I like to contour with a bronzer so
it<00:01:08.909> kind<00:01:09.090> of<00:01:09.120> defeats<00:01:09.390> the<00:01:09.450> object<00:01:09.600> of

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:11.030 
it kind of defeats the object of
contouring<00:01:10.440> because<00:01:10.680> you<00:01:10.770> don't<00:01:10.920> to

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
contouring because you don't to

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:14.149 
contouring because you don't to
highlight<00:01:11.370> and<00:01:11.659> and<00:01:12.659> yeah<00:01:13.560> I<00:01:13.590> just<00:01:13.860> like<00:01:13.979> the

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:08.419 
different ones let me show you this is
benari<00:02:03.600> l1<00:02:06.619> so<00:02:07.619> I'm<00:02:07.890> not<00:02:07.920> sure<00:02:08.099> if<00:02:08.250> that's

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:08.429 
benari l1 so I'm not sure if that's

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:10.100 
benari l1 so I'm not sure if that's
picking<00:02:08.879> up<00:02:09.000> but<00:02:09.119> it's<00:02:09.269> like<00:02:09.450> a<00:02:09.599> rubber<00:02:09.810> wand

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:10.110 
picking up but it's like a rubber wand

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:12.349 
picking up but it's like a rubber wand
so<00:02:10.830> it<00:02:10.920> kind<00:02:11.099> of<00:02:11.129> combs<00:02:11.430> through<00:02:11.609> the<00:02:11.969> lashes

00:02:12.349 --> 00:02:12.359 
so it kind of combs through the lashes

00:02:12.359 --> 00:02:14.179 
so it kind of combs through the lashes
and<00:02:12.569> really<00:02:12.779> separate<00:02:13.319> those<00:02:13.620> which<00:02:13.859> I<00:02:13.980> really

00:02:14.179 --> 00:02:14.189 
and really separate those which I really

00:02:14.189 --> 00:02:16.010 
and really separate those which I really
like

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:16.020 
like

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:24.250 
like
and<00:02:16.110> the<00:02:16.650> collection<00:02:17.360> 2001<00:02:19.820> is<00:02:20.820> a<00:02:21.090> curved<00:02:21.600> wand

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:24.260 

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:27.230 

so<00:02:25.260> it<00:02:25.410> kind<00:02:25.650> of<00:02:25.740> scoops<00:02:26.430> their<00:02:26.790> lashes<00:02:26.940> I

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:27.240 
so it kind of scoops their lashes I

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:29.780 
so it kind of scoops their lashes I
think<00:02:27.750> when<00:02:27.990> you<00:02:28.110> comb<00:02:28.350> it<00:02:28.380> through<00:02:28.590> and<00:02:29.430> both

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:29.790 
think when you comb it through and both

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:31.490 
think when you comb it through and both
of<00:02:29.820> them<00:02:30.090> are<00:02:30.210> pretty<00:02:30.360> label<00:02:30.990> they<00:02:31.140> don't<00:02:31.320> go

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:31.500 
of them are pretty label they don't go

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:33.860 
of them are pretty label they don't go
