00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:12.119 

next<00:03:10.420> is<00:03:10.540> the<00:03:10.689> fun<00:03:10.900> part<00:03:10.959> I'm<00:03:11.469> going<00:03:11.680> to<00:03:11.769> start

00:03:12.119 --> 00:03:12.129

00:03:12.129 --> 00:03:14.190 
next is the fun part I'm going to start
putting<00:03:12.400> DB<00:03:12.969> on<00:03:13.239> so<00:03:13.569> we're<00:03:13.719> going<00:03:13.840> to<00:03:13.900> put<00:03:14.079> the

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:14.200 
putting DB on so we're going to put the

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:16.140 
putting DB on so we're going to put the
bead<00:03:14.409> over<00:03:14.620> the<00:03:14.950> needle<00:03:15.189> onto<00:03:15.400> the<00:03:15.609> thread<00:03:15.939> and

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:16.150 
bead over the needle onto the thread and

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:17.550 
bead over the needle onto the thread and
we're<00:03:16.299> going<00:03:16.420> to<00:03:16.450> place<00:03:16.719> it<00:03:16.900> in<00:03:17.049> the<00:03:17.200> center<00:03:17.530> of

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:17.560 
we're going to place it in the center of

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:20.929 
we're going to place it in the center of
the<00:03:17.859> two<00:03:18.010> cores

00:03:20.929 --> 00:03:20.939 

00:03:20.939 --> 00:03:23.699

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:12.270 
seed is securely in place at this point

00:04:12.270 --> 00:04:14.240 
seed is securely in place at this point
I'm<00:04:12.450> going<00:04:12.630> to<00:04:12.720> go<00:04:12.900> under<00:04:13.170> the<00:04:13.290> left<00:04:13.560> cord<00:04:13.980> and
