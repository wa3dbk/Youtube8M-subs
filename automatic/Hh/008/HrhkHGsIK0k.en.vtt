but the thing that sold them for me is
this<00:03:27.580> weld<00:03:27.910> and<00:03:28.090> here<00:03:28.270> just<00:03:28.480> look<00:03:28.810> at<00:03:28.990> that<00:03:29.280> now

00:03:30.270 --> 00:03:30.280 
this weld and here just look at that now

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:32.490 
this weld and here just look at that now
it<00:03:30.550> might<00:03:30.670> be<00:03:30.730> an<00:03:30.910> engineer's<00:03:31.510> thing<00:03:31.840> because

00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:32.500 
it might be an engineer's thing because

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:34.050 
it might be an engineer's thing because
as<00:03:32.830> you<00:03:33.010> saw<00:03:33.160> now<00:03:33.340> I'm<00:03:33.459> actually<00:03:33.610> a<00:03:33.790> design

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:34.060 
as you saw now I'm actually a design

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:36.780 
as you saw now I'm actually a design
engineer<00:03:34.300> but<00:03:35.260> if<00:03:35.530> I<00:03:35.740> see<00:03:35.980> a<00:03:36.010> good<00:03:36.250> weld<00:03:36.490> like

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:36.790 
engineer but if I see a good weld like

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:38.340 
engineer but if I see a good weld like
this<00:03:37.000> where<00:03:37.360> there's<00:03:37.510> they<00:03:37.720> just<00:03:38.170> look<00:03:38.320> like

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:38.350 
this where there's they just look like

00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:40.949 
this where there's they just look like
pennies<00:03:38.890> on<00:03:39.070> top<00:03:39.250> of<00:03:39.400> each<00:03:39.459> other<00:03:39.670> it<00:03:40.630> just

00:03:40.949 --> 00:03:40.959 
pennies on top of each other it just

00:03:40.959 --> 00:03:42.990 
pennies on top of each other it just
sets<00:03:41.200> me<00:03:41.440> off<00:03:41.470> that's<00:03:41.920> just<00:03:42.250> something<00:03:42.520> if<00:03:42.880> I

00:03:42.990 --> 00:03:43.000 
sets me off that's just something if I

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:44.670 
sets me off that's just something if I
saw<00:03:43.180> on<00:03:43.239> a<00:03:43.360> bike<00:03:43.540> I<00:03:43.780> think<00:03:44.080> that's<00:03:44.260> just<00:03:44.440> good

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:44.680 
saw on a bike I think that's just good

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:47.130 
saw on a bike I think that's just good
quality<00:03:44.890> and<00:03:45.459> it's<00:03:45.820> just<00:03:46.090> been<00:03:46.270> made<00:03:46.540> to<00:03:46.989> no

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:47.140 
quality and it's just been made to no

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:48.990 
quality and it's just been made to no
other<00:03:47.320> end<00:03:47.500> and<00:03:47.950> just<00:03:48.250> look<00:03:48.430> at<00:03:48.550> that<00:03:48.670> for<00:03:48.880> ages

00:03:48.990 --> 00:03:49.000 
other end and just look at that for ages

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:53.490 
other end and just look at that for ages
look<00:03:49.930> they<00:03:50.140> even<00:03:50.170> on<00:03:50.410> here<00:03:50.850> around<00:03:51.850> here<00:03:52.500> down

00:03:53.490 --> 00:03:53.500 
look they even on here around here down

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:55.290 
look they even on here around here down
here<00:03:53.530> basically<00:03:54.250> all<00:03:54.459> the<00:03:54.700> weld<00:03:54.850> on<00:03:55.120> this

00:03:55.290 --> 00:03:55.300 
here basically all the weld on this

00:03:55.300 --> 00:04:00.330 
here basically all the weld on this
exhaust<00:03:56.230> in<00:03:56.890> back<00:03:57.100> box<00:03:57.370> is<00:03:57.670> spot-on<00:03:58.120> and<00:03:59.340> I

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:00.340 
exhaust in back box is spot-on and I

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:02.430 
exhaust in back box is spot-on and I
think<00:04:00.550> having<00:04:01.450> this<00:04:01.660> on<00:04:01.840> the<00:04:01.959> bike<00:04:02.140> or<00:04:02.410> just

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:02.440 
think having this on the bike or just

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:06.120 
think having this on the bike or just
short<00:04:03.190> often<00:04:03.610> no<00:04:03.760> end<00:04:03.970> I<00:04:04.230> just<00:04:05.230> can't<00:04:05.620> get<00:04:05.739> over

00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:11.340 
these are actually spring fit where you

00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:13.070 
these are actually spring fit where you
actually<00:05:11.490> put<00:05:11.759> a<00:05:11.789> spring<00:05:12.150> over<00:05:12.360> them<00:05:12.810> to<00:05:12.930> hold

00:05:13.070 --> 00:05:13.080 
actually put a spring over them to hold

00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:14.870 
actually put a spring over them to hold
them<00:05:13.199> together<00:05:13.319> now<00:05:14.190> there's<00:05:14.550> none<00:05:14.699> of<00:05:14.819> these

00:05:14.870 --> 00:05:14.880 
them together now there's none of these

00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:17.809 
them together now there's none of these
on<00:05:15.210> the<00:05:15.330> actual<00:05:15.630> down<00:05:15.840> pipes<00:05:16.199> of<00:05:16.620> the<00:05:17.520> other

00:05:17.809 --> 00:05:17.819

on the actual down pipes of the other
exhaust<00:05:18.210> because<00:05:18.360> they<00:05:18.539> are<00:05:18.630> meant<00:05:18.780> for<00:05:18.870> him

00:05:19.249 --> 00:05:19.259 
exhaust because they are meant for him

00:06:07.189 --> 00:06:07.199 
bit of their jiggling around and maybe

00:06:07.199 --> 00:06:09.260 
bit of their jiggling around and maybe
mix<00:06:07.469> mounts<00:06:07.949> to<00:06:08.099> fit<00:06:08.250> it<00:06:08.340> onto<00:06:08.520> where<00:06:09.000> I<00:06:09.029> want

00:06:09.260 --> 00:06:09.270 
mix mounts to fit it onto where I want

00:06:09.270 --> 00:06:11.809 
mix mounts to fit it onto where I want
it<00:06:09.389> puts<00:06:09.690> him<00:06:09.900> I'm<00:06:10.800> not<00:06:11.069> really<00:06:11.250> deterred

00:06:19.399 --> 00:06:19.409 
that's basically it a great pipe you can

00:06:19.409 --> 00:06:20.629 
that's basically it a great pipe you can
see<00:06:19.500> where<00:06:19.650> I<00:06:19.680> am<00:06:19.770> over<00:06:20.009> the<00:06:20.099> moon<00:06:20.130> with<00:06:20.430> and
