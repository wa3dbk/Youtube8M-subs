 a lot of people think it's coming 

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:28.700
 due to problems with the stomach or others

 causes but for 90% of cases 

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:33.560
 the cause is in the mouth 

00:00:31.610 --> 00:00:35.000
 problem with bad breath is that you have the 

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:37.130

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.840
 That's because you get used to it and on 

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:40.730
 your own to smell 

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:44.140
 good news is that today 

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:44.140
 treatable 

00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:49.140
 bad to one is caused by 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:51.000
 the bacteria living in the mouth 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:53.130
 bacteria are mainly on 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:56.040
 the back of the tongue between the 

00:00:53.130 --> 00:00:58.080
 teeth and in dental cavity are lives of the 

00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:59.760
 food residues and at the 

00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:01.470
 breaking down these food scraps 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:03.420
 produce those bacteria 

00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:04.800
 sulfur gases in it are precisely these 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:07.710
 sulfur gases 

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:10.020
 that our nasty give him scent you have 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:11.760
 more chance of bad breath by the way 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:14.430
 inadequate oral hygiene 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:16.650
 inflamed gums or dry mouth 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:19.320
 by certain drug use but also 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:21.270
 diets in smoking and using 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:23.400
 alcohol can be a poor environment 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:26.510
 So there are several reasons why one 

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:26.510
 have bad breath 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:31.860

 know if you have a bad breath with it 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:35.850
 others often stand out rather than yourself 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:37.740
 when find it often difficult to 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:39.390
 to say to you 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:40.920
 if you are not directly to family or 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:42.570
 friends dare to ask if you have one 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:44.460
 having bad breath can also be easy 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:46.470
 test yourself 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:49.200
 then click with the back of your tongue 

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:50.670
 on top of your hand and leave this 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:52.710

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:54.479
 if you smell it and this gives one 

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:56.250

 many people with a bad one 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:05.130
 try to mask this by it 

00:02:02.819 --> 00:02:07.170
 use of loyal greenery or mints 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:09.270

 for 90% of the causes of 

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:40.060
 bad breath 

00:02:38.469 --> 00:02:41.920

00:02:45.249 --> 00:02:49.450
 the use of mouthwash that 

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:50.409
 neutralizes this sulfur gas as 

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:52.510
 addition to the daily 

00:02:50.409 --> 00:02:54.700

 make sure we have healthy gums 

00:02:56.409 --> 00:03:01.180
