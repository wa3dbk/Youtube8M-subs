as<00:04:46.150> you<00:04:46.270> can<00:04:46.419> see<00:04:49.259> web<00:04:50.259> damn<00:04:50.880> overall<00:04:51.880> I

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:51.910 
as you can see web damn overall I

00:04:51.910 --> 00:04:54.420 
as you can see web damn overall I
thought<00:04:52.360> I'd<00:04:52.539> just<00:04:52.570> take<00:04:53.500> time<00:04:53.710> out<00:04:53.770> and<00:04:53.979> I

00:04:54.420 --> 00:04:54.430 
thought I'd just take time out and I

00:04:54.430 --> 00:04:56.490 
thought I'd just take time out and I
know<00:04:54.580> it<00:04:54.820> sounds<00:04:54.970> a<00:04:55.120> little<00:04:55.300> weird<00:04:55.330> but<00:04:55.720> so<00:04:56.440> to

00:04:56.490 --> 00:04:56.500 
know it sounds a little weird but so to

00:04:56.500 --> 00:05:00.439 
know it sounds a little weird but so to
tell<00:04:57.190> you<00:04:57.370> about<00:04:57.520> the<00:04:57.970> evolution<00:04:58.780> of<00:04:59.440> the<00:05:00.130> card

00:05:00.439 --> 00:05:00.449 
tell you about the evolution of the card

00:05:00.449 --> 00:05:03.540 
tell you about the evolution of the card
of<00:05:01.449> certain<00:05:01.810> yugioh<00:05:02.080> cards<00:05:02.530> and<00:05:02.770> in<00:05:03.070> this<00:05:03.250> case

00:05:03.540 --> 00:05:03.550 
of certain yugioh cards and in this case

00:05:03.550 --> 00:05:05.310 
of certain yugioh cards and in this case
the<00:05:03.789> dark<00:05:04.030> magician<00:05:04.479> girl<00:05:04.509> and<00:05:04.810> how<00:05:04.900> she<00:05:04.990> came

00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:05.320 
the dark magician girl and how she came

00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:08.580 
the dark magician girl and how she came
from<00:05:05.590> this<00:05:05.860> to<00:05:06.849> have<00:05:07.000> the<00:05:07.570> being<00:05:07.750> involved<00:05:08.229> is

00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:08.590 
from this to have the being involved is

00:05:08.590 --> 00:05:15.779 
from this to have the being involved is
spinning<00:05:09.340> off<00:05:09.520> basically<00:05:14.490> cards<00:05:15.490> like<00:05:15.639> this

00:05:15.779 --> 00:05:15.789 
spinning off basically cards like this

00:05:15.789 --> 00:05:17.610 
spinning off basically cards like this
so<00:05:16.180> yeah<00:05:16.360> it's<00:05:16.539> not<00:05:16.659> just<00:05:16.840> an<00:05:16.960> evolution<00:05:17.530> of

00:05:17.610 --> 00:05:17.620 
so yeah it's not just an evolution of

00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:21.200 
so yeah it's not just an evolution of
the<00:05:17.740> card<00:05:17.979> to<00:05:18.220> this<00:05:18.430> and<00:05:19.320> design<00:05:20.320> wise<00:05:20.560> to<00:05:20.889> this

00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:21.210 
the card to this and design wise to this

00:05:21.210 --> 00:05:24.719 
the card to this and design wise to this
but<00:05:22.210> it's<00:05:22.360> also<00:05:22.479> to<00:05:22.630> show<00:05:22.840> up<00:05:22.900> a<00:05:23.050> spin-off<00:05:23.380> of<00:05:23.729> a

00:05:24.719 --> 00:05:24.729 
but it's also to show up a spin-off of a

00:05:24.729 --> 00:05:28.080 
but it's also to show up a spin-off of a
card<00:05:25.030> into<00:05:25.330> this<00:05:25.539> and<00:05:26.490> I<00:05:27.490> hope<00:05:27.520> you<00:05:27.789> enjoyed
