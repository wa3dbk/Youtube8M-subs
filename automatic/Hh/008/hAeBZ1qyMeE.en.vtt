Cobras<00:00:54.239> we're<00:00:54.449> just<00:00:54.719> sits<00:00:54.899> in<00:00:55.079> the<00:00:55.410> water<00:00:55.559> sits

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
Cobras we're just sits in the water sits

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:58.310 
Cobras we're just sits in the water sits
with<00:00:56.070> the<00:00:56.129> coffee<00:00:56.340> for<00:00:56.940> 12<00:00:57.300> to<00:00:57.420> 24<00:00:57.780> hours<00:00:57.809> so<00:00:58.170> we

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
with the coffee for 12 to 24 hours so we

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:00.020 
with the coffee for 12 to 24 hours so we
said<00:00:58.500> yeah<00:00:58.739> we'll<00:00:59.100> try<00:00:59.340> it<00:00:59.370> probably<00:00:59.850> going<00:00:59.969> to

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
said yeah we'll try it probably going to

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:01.639 
said yeah we'll try it probably going to
taste<00:01:00.180> okay<00:01:00.539> but<00:01:00.719> like<00:01:01.020> we're<00:01:01.230> going<00:01:01.350> to<00:01:01.440> do<00:01:01.559> it

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:01.649 
taste okay but like we're going to do it

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:05.240 
taste okay but like we're going to do it
so<00:01:02.460> the<00:01:02.699> proportions<00:01:03.329> are<00:01:03.680> four<00:01:04.680> parts<00:01:04.920> of

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
so the proportions are four parts of

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:09.590 
so the proportions are four parts of
water<00:01:05.519> to<00:01:06.320> one<00:01:07.320> part<00:01:07.350> of<00:01:07.740> coffee<00:01:07.979> so<00:01:08.820> it's<00:01:09.210> 80

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
water to one part of coffee so it's 80

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:12.800 
water to one part of coffee so it's 80
grams<00:01:10.020> of<00:01:10.520> coffee<00:01:11.520> pre-ground<00:01:12.119> coffee<00:01:12.150> we're

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
grams of coffee pre-ground coffee we're

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:15.380 
grams of coffee pre-ground coffee we're
going<00:01:12.930> to<00:01:12.990> put<00:01:13.110> in<00:01:13.229> here<00:01:13.470> and<00:01:13.970> then<00:01:14.970> I'm<00:01:15.210> going

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
going to put in here and then I'm going

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:21.410 
going to put in here and then I'm going
to<00:01:15.479> put<00:01:15.659> in<00:01:16.430> 350<00:01:17.430> grams<00:01:17.880> of<00:01:20.420> room-temperature

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
to put in 350 grams of room-temperature

don't do that I can see it's going to

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:52.470 
don't do that I can see it's going to
take<00:02:49.390> a<00:02:49.420> minute<00:02:49.750> for<00:02:49.959> it<00:02:49.989> to<00:02:50.080> actually<00:02:51.480> go

take a minute for it to actually go
through<00:02:52.660> the<00:02:52.810> grounds<00:02:53.200> and<00:02:53.380> out<00:02:54.070> the<00:02:54.250> bottom

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:29.590 

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:32.950 

that's<00:03:30.590> better<00:03:30.830> that's<00:03:31.280> actually<00:03:31.730> like<00:03:32.720> that

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:32.960 
that's better that's actually like that

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:35.620 
that's better that's actually like that
it's<00:03:33.140> pretty<00:03:33.260> good<00:03:33.670> it<00:03:34.670> tastes<00:03:35.030> good<00:03:35.150> it's<00:03:35.450> not

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:35.630

it tastes like cold brew I think it's

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:41.770

not<00:03:40.790> as<00:03:40.910> bad<00:03:41.030> as<00:03:41.090> I<00:03:41.270> thought<00:03:41.420> it<00:03:41.510> was<00:03:41.630> going<00:03:41.750> to

00:03:41.770 --> 00:03:41.780 
not as bad as I thought it was going to

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:43.000 
not as bad as I thought it was going to
be<00:03:41.900> because<00:03:41.990> when<00:03:42.200> I<00:03:42.260> was<00:03:42.350> first<00:03:42.410> pouring<00:03:42.920> it

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:43.010 
be because when I was first pouring it

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:45.610 
be because when I was first pouring it
out<00:03:43.100> of<00:03:43.310> the<00:03:43.780> let<00:03:44.780> that<00:03:44.930> rip<00:03:45.230> out<00:03:45.410> of<00:03:45.530> the

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:45.620 
out of the let that rip out of the

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:47.980 
out of the let that rip out of the
immersion<00:03:45.830> tripper<00:03:46.340> it<00:03:46.430> looked<00:03:46.610> like<00:03:46.760> mud<00:03:47.000> mud

00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:47.990 
immersion tripper it looked like mud mud

00:03:47.990 --> 00:03:53.760 
immersion tripper it looked like mud mud
plain<00:03:48.830> old<00:03:49.040> mud<00:03:50.260> still<00:03:51.260> looks<00:03:51.500> like<00:03:51.560> mud

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:53.770 
plain old mud still looks like mud

00:03:53.770 --> 00:03:55.930 
plain old mud still looks like mud
anyway<00:03:54.770> it's<00:03:54.950> not<00:03:55.070> bad<00:03:55.280> I<00:03:55.310> guess<00:03:55.580> you<00:03:55.700> could<00:03:55.850> do

00:03:55.930 --> 00:03:55.940 
anyway it's not bad I guess you could do

00:03:55.940 --> 00:03:59.140 
anyway it's not bad I guess you could do
it<00:03:56.060> that<00:03:56.210> way<00:03:56.390> I<00:03:56.420> mean<00:03:56.840> I<00:03:57.100> it<00:03:58.100> went<00:03:58.550> really<00:03:58.760> slow

00:03:59.140 --> 00:03:59.150 
it that way I mean I it went really slow

00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:01.570 
it that way I mean I it went really slow
it<00:03:59.690> dripped<00:03:59.990> very<00:04:00.350> slow<00:04:00.740> I<00:04:01.040> wonder<00:04:01.340> if<00:04:01.460> we

00:04:01.570 --> 00:04:01.580 
it dripped very slow I wonder if we

00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:05.230 
it dripped very slow I wonder if we
could<00:04:01.760> have<00:04:02.260> maybe<00:04:03.260> made<00:04:03.530> the<00:04:04.040> grind<00:04:04.370> just<00:04:04.760> a

00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:05.240 
could have maybe made the grind just a

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:08.890 
could have maybe made the grind just a
little<00:04:05.510> bit<00:04:05.660> coarser<00:04:06.140> but<00:04:06.740> hey<00:04:07.900> experiment

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:08.900 
little bit coarser but hey experiment

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:14.160 
little bit coarser but hey experiment
done<00:04:09.050> worked<00:04:09.830> it's<00:04:10.730> applause

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:14.170 

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:16.230 

you
