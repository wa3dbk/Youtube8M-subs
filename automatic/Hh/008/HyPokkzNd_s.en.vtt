00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:25.180 
conditioned so I applied quite a bit and
I<00:02:21.390> applied<00:02:21.690> mostly<00:02:22.560> to<00:02:22.800> this<00:02:23.010> part<00:02:23.730> down<00:02:24.540> and

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:25.190 
I applied mostly to this part down and

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:27.680 
I applied mostly to this part down and
then<00:02:26.190> the<00:02:26.400> rest<00:02:26.580> had<00:02:26.790> kind<00:02:26.970> of<00:02:27.030> massaged<00:02:27.390> it

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:27.690 
then the rest had kind of massaged it

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:29.960 
then the rest had kind of massaged it
into<00:02:27.780> my<00:02:28.050> scalp<00:02:28.349> I<00:02:28.680> try<00:02:29.340> to<00:02:29.400> make<00:02:29.580> sure<00:02:29.610> not<00:02:29.880> to

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:29.970 
into my scalp I try to make sure not to

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:31.520 
into my scalp I try to make sure not to
put<00:02:30.120> on<00:02:30.209> too<00:02:30.450> much<00:02:30.630> on<00:02:30.810> my<00:02:30.900> scalp<00:02:31.140> because<00:02:31.410> it

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:31.530 
put on too much on my scalp because it

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:33.710 
put on too much on my scalp because it
didn't<00:02:31.739> want<00:02:31.920> my<00:02:32.310> scalp<00:02:32.700> to<00:02:32.849> be<00:02:32.880> like<00:02:33.150> way<00:02:33.480> down

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:33.720 
didn't want my scalp to be like way down

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:36.199 
didn't want my scalp to be like way down
but<00:02:34.230> I<00:02:34.260> applied<00:02:34.590> a<00:02:34.620> lot<00:02:34.800> today<00:02:34.980> and<00:02:35.069> I<00:02:35.730> don't

00:02:36.199 --> 00:02:36.209 
but I applied a lot today and I don't

00:02:36.209 --> 00:02:38.059 
but I applied a lot today and I don't
think<00:02:36.390> it<00:02:36.510> weighted<00:02:36.810> down<00:02:36.959> if<00:02:37.560> anything<00:02:37.980> I

00:02:38.059 --> 00:02:38.069 
think it weighted down if anything I

00:02:38.069 --> 00:02:40.550 
think it weighted down if anything I
think<00:02:38.250> it<00:02:38.340> just<00:02:38.489> made<00:02:38.640> it<00:02:38.900> curlier<00:02:39.900> for<00:02:40.440> some

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:40.560 
think it just made it curlier for some

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:41.960 
think it just made it curlier for some
reason<00:02:40.830> and<00:02:40.980> I<00:02:41.069> can<00:02:41.220> honestly<00:02:41.370> say<00:02:41.670> this

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:41.970 
reason and I can honestly say this

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:43.759 
reason and I can honestly say this
because<00:02:42.300> I<00:02:42.480> have<00:02:42.660> never<00:02:42.810> experienced<00:02:43.620> this

00:02:43.759 --> 00:02:43.769 
because I have never experienced this

00:02:43.769 --> 00:02:47.870 
because I have never experienced this
before<00:02:43.830> like<00:02:44.819> usually<00:02:45.330> all<00:02:46.260> products<00:02:47.190> that<00:02:47.850> I

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:47.880 
before like usually all products that I

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:50.449 
before like usually all products that I
put<00:02:48.269> on<00:02:48.660> my<00:02:49.260> hair<00:02:49.470> like<00:02:49.680> if<00:02:49.799> I'm<00:02:49.890> gonna<00:02:49.980> air<00:02:50.220> dry

00:02:50.449 --> 00:02:50.459 
put on my hair like if I'm gonna air dry

00:02:50.459 --> 00:02:52.460 
put on my hair like if I'm gonna air dry
it<00:02:50.519> my<00:02:51.120> hair<00:02:51.269> generally<00:02:51.810> tends<00:02:52.170> to<00:02:52.350> look

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:52.470 
it my hair generally tends to look

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:55.160 
it my hair generally tends to look
stringy<00:02:52.950> and<00:02:53.700> I<00:02:53.760> don't<00:02:53.819> get<00:02:54.030> definition<00:02:54.239> and<00:02:54.780> I

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:55.170 
stringy and I don't get definition and I

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:58.130 
stringy and I don't get definition and I
lose<00:02:55.410> a<00:02:55.709> little<00:02:55.890> bit<00:02:56.010> of<00:02:56.130> my<00:02:56.310> curl<00:02:56.580> but<00:02:57.299> with

00:02:58.130 --> 00:02:58.140 
lose a little bit of my curl but with

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:00.350 
lose a little bit of my curl but with
this<00:02:58.349> new<00:02:59.220> step<00:02:59.519> with<00:02:59.700> conditioning<00:03:00.239> with

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:00.360 
this new step with conditioning with

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:02.720 
this new step with conditioning with
coconut<00:03:00.810> oil<00:03:01.019> now<00:03:01.260> that<00:03:01.920> my<00:03:02.040> curls<00:03:02.370> actually

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:02.730 
coconut oil now that my curls actually

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:05.570 
coconut oil now that my curls actually
became<00:03:03.030> a<00:03:03.390> little<00:03:03.870> bit<00:03:04.019> tighter<00:03:04.459> which<00:03:05.459> is

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:05.580 
became a little bit tighter which is

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:10.280 
became a little bit tighter which is
awesome<00:03:06.230> so<00:03:07.230> I<00:03:07.560> left<00:03:08.519> it<00:03:08.760> in<00:03:08.880> my<00:03:08.910> hair<00:03:09.239> I<00:03:09.480> left

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:14.640 
hour so I just basically rolled it up in

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:16.789 
hour so I just basically rolled it up in
a<00:03:14.700> button<00:03:15.000> and<00:03:15.180> just<00:03:15.269> let<00:03:15.450> it<00:03:15.480> up<00:03:15.690> there<00:03:15.959> let<00:03:16.769> it
