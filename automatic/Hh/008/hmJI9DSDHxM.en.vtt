00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309 
he's behind at the time or so you've

he's behind at the time or so you've
never<00:00:47.430> seen<00:00:47.670> a<00:00:47.699> fighter<00:00:47.970> come<00:00:48.269> from<00:00:48.420> the

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
never seen a fighter come from the

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:51.109 
never seen a fighter come from the
mining<00:00:48.720> me<00:00:48.960> and<00:00:49.379> maybe<00:00:49.589> would<00:00:49.890> have<00:00:49.920> won<00:00:50.190> but

00:00:51.109 --> 00:00:51.119 
mining me and maybe would have won but

00:00:51.119 --> 00:00:53.630 
mining me and maybe would have won but
at<00:00:51.420> least<00:00:51.659> we<00:00:52.350> wanted<00:00:52.619> to<00:00:52.650> see<00:00:52.890> if<00:00:52.920> our<00:00:53.369> plan

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
at least we wanted to see if our plan

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:54.799 
at least we wanted to see if our plan
would<00:00:53.820> have<00:00:53.850> worked<00:00:53.940> and<00:00:54.330> we<00:00:54.420> believe<00:00:54.690> it

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
would have worked and we believe it

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:57.649 
would have worked and we believe it
would<00:00:54.930> up<00:00:55.080> but<00:00:55.350> again<00:00:56.190> that<00:00:56.430> it's<00:00:56.699> just<00:00:56.850> going

00:00:57.649 --> 00:00:57.659 
would up but again that it's just going

00:00:57.659 --> 00:00:59.689 
would up but again that it's just going
over<00:00:57.780> old<00:00:57.930> issues<00:00:58.470> and<00:00:58.799> I<00:00:58.949> think<00:00:59.309> if<00:00:59.400> we<00:00:59.519> do

00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699 
over old issues and I think if we do

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:03.859 
over old issues and I think if we do
that<00:00:59.729> we<00:01:00.059> run<00:01:00.239> a<00:01:00.299> risk<00:01:00.570> of<00:01:01.339> always<00:01:02.479> living<00:01:03.479> in<00:01:03.780> a

00:01:03.859 --> 00:01:03.869 
that we run a risk of always living in a

00:01:03.869 --> 00:01:05.380 
that we run a risk of always living in a
past<00:01:04.140> and<00:01:04.500> I<00:01:04.559> think<00:01:04.769> as<00:01:04.890> a<00:01:04.920> fighter

00:01:05.380 --> 00:01:05.390 
past and I think as a fighter

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:07.700 
past and I think as a fighter
particularly<00:01:06.390> with<00:01:06.510> Paul<00:01:06.750> now<00:01:06.990> Paul<00:01:07.500> doesn't

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
particularly with Paul now Paul doesn't

stage<00:05:13.250> that<00:05:13.550> he<00:05:13.669> look<00:05:13.789> uncomfortable<00:05:14.120> to<00:05:14.539> me

00:05:14.650 --> 00:05:14.660 
stage that he look uncomfortable to me

00:05:14.660 --> 00:05:17.379 
stage that he look uncomfortable to me
and<00:05:15.470> beyond<00:05:16.039> the<00:05:16.130> fight<00:05:16.370> itself<00:05:16.760> that<00:05:17.090> proved

00:05:17.379 --> 00:05:17.389 
and beyond the fight itself that proved

00:05:17.389 --> 00:05:18.580 
and beyond the fight itself that proved
to<00:05:17.479> me<00:05:17.599> more<00:05:17.750> than<00:05:17.840> anything<00:05:18.110> that<00:05:18.410> he<00:05:18.470> was

00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:18.590 
to me more than anything that he was

00:05:18.590 --> 00:05:20.529 
to me more than anything that he was
fully<00:05:18.889> composed<00:05:19.250> of<00:05:19.490> that<00:05:19.610> level<00:05:19.910> I<00:05:20.090> think

00:05:20.529 --> 00:05:20.539 
fully composed of that level I think

00:05:20.539 --> 00:05:22.270 
fully composed of that level I think
that's<00:05:20.660> so<00:05:20.870> important<00:05:21.349> and<00:05:21.530> I<00:05:21.950> think<00:05:21.979> it<00:05:22.220> was

00:05:22.270 --> 00:05:22.280 
that's so important and I think it was

00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:23.680 
that's so important and I think it was
composed<00:05:22.729> throughout<00:05:23.030> that<00:05:23.150> fight<00:05:23.389> he<00:05:23.539> never

00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:23.690 
composed throughout that fight he never

00:05:23.690 --> 00:05:24.879 
composed throughout that fight he never
looked<00:05:23.930> for<00:05:23.960> us<00:05:24.110> that<00:05:24.289> he<00:05:24.380> never<00:05:24.560> looked<00:05:24.770> in

00:05:24.879 --> 00:05:24.889 
looked for us that he never looked in

00:05:24.889 --> 00:05:27.219 
looked for us that he never looked in
trouble<00:05:25.250> and<00:05:25.400> he<00:05:26.180> never<00:05:26.360> took<00:05:26.570> any<00:05:26.750> big<00:05:26.960> shots

00:05:27.219 --> 00:05:27.229 
trouble and he never took any big shots

00:05:27.229 --> 00:05:29.930 
trouble and he never took any big shots
