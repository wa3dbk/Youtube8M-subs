00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.790
 well that's his opinion is that the most 

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:04.650
 today we find ourselves for a 

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:06.029
 new video guys a video that at 

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:07.890
 my opinion a lot of people are waiting 

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:09.450
 since I had made a question finally 

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:11.280
 a poll on my last video if you 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:13.590
 wanted the review of yassine chikhaoui 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:15.420
 saw that I pack him in so well 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:17.430
 obviously you have been many to me 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:18.869
 requested and as promised I like 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:19.980
 you feel it guys I 'm taking you out this 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:21.480
 video so I really hope that's okay 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:23.130
 make you happy so there and who already 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:24.210
 if you 're happy guys in all 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:26.220
 case me it makes me happy to you 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:27.449
 propose this video so that's what 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:29.070
 what can be said about yassine chikhaoui 

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:30.599
 so there you see in which team I 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:32.250
 the holds and so the enemy with two 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:33.329
 fc zurich players for them 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:33.809
 were going green link for it to have the 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:36.899
 collective 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:37.800
 I could have the guy the master with then 

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:38.730
 as they are called I know more 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:40.950
 how is it called there are new 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:42.480
 and also has a Tunisian who plays in Zurich 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:44.309
 so that would have made a perfect connection with 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:45.450
 him but it was a money card she 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:46.500
 cost more than 10000 credit because 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:48.329
 it's the only direct link we can 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:51.180
 do with him so that's me team of 

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:53.579
 France me liga bbva down and then 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:55.620
 middle rich in right so yassin 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:56.969
 chikhaoui so these are five stars of 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:57.449
 bad foot five stars gestures 

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:00.180
 techniques 

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:01.350
 so frankly I do not know how he 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:02.850
 see right now I think he 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:04.260
 need five thousand credit maybe on the 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:05.700
 live maybe a little more maybe a 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:06.900
 a little less sweet case it's not worth 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:09.659
 masses it does not take a million like 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:10.650
 some players so here it is affordable 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:12.180
 to everyone so that's it's a 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:15.119
 review that I really wanted 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:17.520
 So here you do what do we 

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:19.799
 can say so he has a very nice note 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:21.330
 of dribbling he is very very good dribbling 

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:22.950
 Gabon and technically there is no 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:25.770
 worry to be done with this player there he 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:27.330
 is very very very very good so if you 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:29.520
 know how to dribble guys normally you 

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:31.710
 pleasure that's for sure and then after 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:32.790
 that's it in speed it's pretty good because 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:34.110
 that they are physically sturdy 

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:37.079
 physically I believe it's a meter 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:38.670
 89 and 1 m 89 it's very very good for a 

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:41.640
 attac player 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:42.540
 there is m 89 he has 84 speed so with 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:45.060
 his meter eighty-nine who grows 

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:46.530
 everyone he 's shooting at 1.73 which 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:47.640
 fishing a little bit I really was 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:49.770
 disappointed with its finish 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:51.810
 it has a rating of 70 it's frankly 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:52.770
 this is the record you see 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:53.970
 currently I do not know if this is the 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:55.530
 definitive because I had done again 

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:56.880
 other marches with so five matches 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:58.770
 6 goals 3 assists it's not 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:00.869
 excellent it's excellent certainly he has 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:02.130
 still an 80 years pass so he has me 

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:03.630
 still makes three assists 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:04.920
 so it's not excellent of course but 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:06.719
 I was really disappointed with its finish 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:08.220
 you guys are going to see in the clips 

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:09.420
 that who are going to follow I did 

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:10.619
 a few small which is true but I 

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:11.360
 had fun one i tried some stuff 

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:12.740
 as 

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:14.300
 you ask for it plus 5 stars have 

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:15.260
 frankly seriously must that 

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:16.460
 I'm still trying a little bit 

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:18.440
 so I tried to dodge orange 

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:19.940
 arrives for the goal keeper is fate 

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:21.380
 all the balloons either he misses 

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:22.940
 completely the frame you'll see there 

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:23.840
 will not have that data debut 

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:26.120
 in the clips it's just for you 

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:26.810
 show well what I know I am 

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:28.160
 telling you 

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:29.450
 he really has a finishing problem 

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:31.370
 it's a shame but still very good 

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:32.810
 player with his 5 stars technically 

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:34.280
 it's perfect so there you guys have 

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:35.780
 statins games that are in the process of 

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:36.920
 scroll down so I invite you to do some 

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:38.540
 little breaks if you really want to 

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:40.780
 see some stats 

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:43.550
 so that's going to scroll behind 

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:44.090
 behind me finally behind do what 

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:46.340
 quite simply 

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:47.300
 so this is the first review that there is 

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:49.040
 on the chain and what can we 

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:50.600
 say so on this there is sin chikhaoui 

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:52.220
 so in advantage the ranges 

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:53.720
 technically if you know wheats 

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:55.820
 you are happy and you guys are going 

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:56.780
 really have fun you will see 

00:02:55.820 --> 00:02:58.100
 in the clips that there are moments I 

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:59.540
 I had fun frankly I took 

00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:00.860
 fun to play with this player there it is 

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:02.300
 just that I was really disappointed because 

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:03.470
 that I do what he gives me I do 

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:04.910
 a nice action et cetera plays 

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:06.530
 collective here I do some small 

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:07.910
 dribbles jarry face the goal either 

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:09.950
 completely the frame 

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:11.360
 like on this action here it is or so 

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:12.560
 it's just the guardian he stops 

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:14.239
 so I do not know the guardians of 

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:16.040
 very very good way you refuse 15 

00:03:14.239 --> 00:03:17.239
 even deep down it does not have a 

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:18.470
 very nice note I can pass it on 

00:03:17.239 --> 00:03:19.880
 the post unfortunately it does not have 

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:21.799
 ended in the bottom the real it was just for 

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:22.940
 illustrate you a little this stat that 

00:03:21.799 --> 00:03:24.049
 is not huge but here you come 

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:25.820
 still attracted look there I do 

00:03:24.049 --> 00:03:27.470
 a few small ones a few little grigris 

00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:28.459
 after unfortunately the guardian the ridge 

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:30.260
 it's a pity it's also to show 

00:03:28.459 --> 00:03:31.730
 his note of dribbling that I put you 

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:33.769
 his clips there because that's it if I put 

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:35.209
 that this red mark is not going well and the 

00:03:33.769 --> 00:03:36.799
 here in finish sometimes 

00:03:35.209 --> 00:03:38.360
 frankly it does anything 

00:03:36.799 --> 00:03:40.100
 on the other hand technically there is nothing to 

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:41.930
 blame him he's very very very very 

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:43.420
 agile he is very very good he is 

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:45.110
 physically strong 

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:46.340
 frankly there's no trouble to do 

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:48.140
 this is finally it ends anyway 

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:49.610
 default to the funds sent there are not 5e 

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:51.950
 bad foot which is very good 

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:54.080
 illustrated after that you need not no 

00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:54.410
 no longer be here that I tried a shot of the 

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:55.700
 scarf 

00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:57.380
 unfortunately it's completely 

00:03:55.700 --> 00:03:58.370
 leave these finishing problems aside 

00:03:57.380 --> 00:04:00.140
 it's a bit of a pity 

00:03:58.370 --> 00:04:01.190
 you see that he really has them 

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:02.090
 abilities to make beautiful gestures 

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:03.680
 techniques etc 

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:05.810
 unfortunately they do not fit 

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:07.470
 after all the time to pass it notes 

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:08.790
 at 1.80 so in 

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:10.140
 we pass decisive he is very very good 

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:11.310
 he gave a lot of lacazette balloons 

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:14.070
 I believe that the illustrated only one 

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:15.480
 once in Eric's team once you 

00:04:14.070 --> 00:04:17.010
 go see I believe it's towards the end and 

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:18.480
 look at her and I'm doing crazy strikes 

00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:20.070
 he kept a kind where it's a pity 

00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:22.019
 because if every time I went 

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:23.340
 hit you make a little pen run that 

00:04:22.019 --> 00:04:25.560
 would have been in frankly star was 

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:27.450
 rather not bad but here I think that 

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:29.000
 if you know what he is you're going 

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:31.370
 you really get by face 

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:33.690
 to noise easily with this player 

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:35.880
 it's really not complicated 

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:37.440
 scooters do not pass cream guys I I 

00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:39.570
 am a follower of the scoop run of the scoop 

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:41.760
 turn and frankly they pass cream 

00:04:39.570 --> 00:04:42.900
 but as on was 13 I do not know 

00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:44.250
 if there are any who remember drums 13 

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:46.290
 May on was very these scooters did not want 

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:47.880
 not really saw it easily and then 

00:04:46.290 --> 00:04:49.320
 here after there are a few small ones 

00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:50.580
 basic dribbles that I know how to do but 

00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:53.430
 I'm not what it is far from there 

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:55.170
 that's why I do not advance 

00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:56.520
 too much about it and that's why I 

00:04:55.170 --> 00:04:57.780
 think well that those who know what he 

00:04:56.520 --> 00:04:59.070
 is really they know all the 

00:04:57.780 --> 00:05:01.470
 dribbling they will really get done 

00:04:59.070 --> 00:05:03.180
 pleasure and that player there and I hope 

00:05:01.470 --> 00:05:05.880
 for you in addition it is very accessible 

00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:07.020
 really a price not very expensive even if 

00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:08.280
 at the beginning of flight you do not have 

00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:09.900
 a lot of credit there is way to get 

00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:11.130
 please guys after long 

00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:13.620
 shot he does not have a very nice stats 

00:05:11.130 --> 00:05:16.260
 you did not even try any more with 170 of 

00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:18.780
 finish is not good in free kicks 

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:20.550
 that's it's not huge either after 

00:05:18.780 --> 00:05:22.350
 this is mostly his physics note 

00:05:20.550 --> 00:05:25.430
 so the big point strong c span of 

00:05:22.350 --> 00:05:28.650
 physical his meter eighty-nine his 

00:05:25.430 --> 00:05:30.690
 agility dribbles so technically it's 

00:05:28.650 --> 00:05:31.890
 perfect here I repeat these five 

00:05:30.690 --> 00:05:34.080
 bad foot star who is when 

00:05:31.890 --> 00:05:35.340
 even a little bit and then the 5 stars 

00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:37.380
 technical gesture obviously this is it 

00:05:35.340 --> 00:05:39.150
 which is the charm of chikhaoui
