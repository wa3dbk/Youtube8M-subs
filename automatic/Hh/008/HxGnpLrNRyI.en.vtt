00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:44.460
 what does academy pack mean because they have 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:46.860

 own subsidiary are the academy is the 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:57.780
 training that will supply players 

00:00:55.650 --> 00:00:59.730
 to the first team and in the academy 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:01.830
 some very legendary coaches 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:03.090
 among them alex ferguson have the 

00:01:01.830 --> 00:01:04.350
 custom that football players do not 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:06.060
 can do certain things until 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:08.040
 come to the first team for example puts 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:09.390
 that shirt on the outside of the pants and 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:11.009
 one of the most characteristic things 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:12.690
 precisely from the entracer who named 

00:01:11.009 --> 00:01:14.009
 formerly alex ferguson is that 

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:15.330
 he has always liked that the players 

00:01:14.009 --> 00:01:17.460
 of academy wear the black boots 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:18.960
 when they are professionals they will highlight 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:20.610
 with boots of color at the moment boots 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:22.470
 black to go unnoticed and 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:24.390
 get uniformity with that 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:26.130
 inspiration with that unai idea that has 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:28.320
 launched this academy pack with a 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:30.720
 Totally black coloration included 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:32.700
 the colors of the former bus only 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:34.350
 small details of color in the sole 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:38.149
 which are the ones that contribute that tone 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:38.149
 differential to each of the boots 

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:50.470
 [Music] 

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:51.880
 although aesthetically all the boots are 

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:52.930
 see the same each one has its own 

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:54.880
 identity 

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:56.439
 we have the model time model 

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:58.060
 made of kangaroo leather 

00:01:56.439 --> 00:01:59.740
 natural for players who want 

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:02.080
 maximum comfort and a boot that goes 

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:03.790
 to adjust alpe features that you 

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:05.380
 will provide the boot time in addition to 

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:06.850
 the conical studs for the sole so that 

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:09.220
 you can make turns so you can 

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:11.170
 pivot and that players who seek 

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:13.860
 more take a walk feel comfortable in the 

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:17.839
 game have adequate support 

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:17.839
 [Music] 

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:23.800
 [Music] 

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:25.360
 totally antagonistic we have the model 

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:27.730
 hyper venom is a manufactured model 

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:29.110
 completely in synthetic leather is a 

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:30.580
 model that will support the games 

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:32.680
 more reactive to players than what 

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:34.660
 they are looking for is the dribble the sprint 

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:37.120
 why it has the new sole plate 

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:38.530
 bifida two different sections for 

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:39.819
 be able to have maximum support whether 

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:42.750
 we step on one side to another to 

00:02:39.819 --> 00:02:42.750
 bargain in one or the other direction 

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:46.229
 [Music] 

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:50.980
 and then the two most models 

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:52.780
 revolutionary the two models 

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:54.340
 made in fly need that also 

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:56.020
 they will have their low version but for 

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:58.450
 this video we have taken the model that 

00:02:56.020 --> 00:03:00.100
 has the dynamic fit colar model 

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:01.600
 macho also designed for players 

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:03.370
 of midfield or players that what 

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:04.810
 want is a good touch of the ball 

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:07.300
 that takes three layers of dynamics 

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:08.590
 wears the sole with combination of pe 

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:10.660
 bucks and nylon that will also give us 

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:12.340
 very similar to the very good time mode 

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:14.140
 support in turns in any action 

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:17.790
 that a footballer has to do 

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:17.790
 have to control everything around 

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:26.050
 [Music] 

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:28.570
 and finally the most aggressive boot the 

00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:30.100
 boot for attack players is the 

00:03:28.570 --> 00:03:31.630
 mercurial superfly is also 

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:33.430
 made in fly night but has 

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:35.740
 only two layers so it's a lot 

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:37.600
 lighter has the bio cables for 

00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:39.790
 adjust the boot to the maximum at the foot and on 

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:41.740
 all the great novelty of this boot is the 

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:43.600
 Soles the carbon fiber plate that 

00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:45.820
 will guarantee us total reactivity in 

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:48.040
 career and the special disposition of 

00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:49.720
 tacos laminated studs for support 

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:53.310
 to have traction at maximum speed 

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:53.310
 in starts and braking 

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:57.270
 [Music] 

00:03:55.660 --> 00:04:00.409
 ah 

00:03:57.270 --> 00:04:00.409
 [Music] 

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:06.200
 you finally know the academy collection 

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:08.150
 pack the boots that alex ferguson would want 

00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:10.010
 for the players of his academy that to 

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:11.840
 I love them because of the classic sense 

00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:13.190
 which has each of these colors and 

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:14.630
 that you can also use if you are in 

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:16.370
 a sponsorship contract with none 

00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:18.470
 brand and you want it not to be noticed with what 

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:19.790
 boots are you playing something other resource 

00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:21.980
 multiple used by many games 

00:04:19.790 --> 00:04:23.810
 professionals where to get them because 

00:04:21.980 --> 00:04:25.400

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:26.540

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:28.490
