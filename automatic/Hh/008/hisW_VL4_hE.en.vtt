00:00:17.359 --> 00:00:17.369 
you shiny 2012 DTM car there's a number

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:19.490 
you shiny 2012 DTM car there's a number
of<00:00:17.520> changes<00:00:17.760> which<00:00:18.570> make<00:00:18.810> this<00:00:18.990> a<00:00:19.230> more

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:19.500 
of changes which make this a more

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:21.560 
of changes which make this a more
sophisticated<00:00:19.830> technical<00:00:20.609> car<00:00:20.880> and<00:00:21.449> we're

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:21.570 
sophisticated technical car and we're

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:25.970 
sophisticated technical car and we're
going<00:00:21.689> to<00:00:21.750> take<00:00:21.840> a<00:00:21.869> look<00:00:22.080> at<00:00:22.140> those<00:00:22.199> now<00:00:24.800> so<00:00:25.800> if

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:25.980 
going to take a look at those now so if

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:27.769 
going to take a look at those now so if
we<00:00:26.099> start<00:00:26.340> here<00:00:26.400> with<00:00:26.910> the<00:00:27.090> most<00:00:27.240> significant

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:27.779 
we start here with the most significant

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:29.870 
we start here with the most significant
change<00:00:27.990> visually<00:00:28.380> we've<00:00:28.859> got<00:00:29.130> the<00:00:29.519> old<00:00:29.640> spec

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:29.880 
change visually we've got the old spec

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:32.990 
change visually we've got the old spec
tire<00:00:30.179> here<00:00:30.539> and<00:00:30.720> the<00:00:31.289> new<00:00:31.380> expect<00:00:31.650> our<00:00:32.000> new

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:33.000 
tire here and the new expect our new

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.630 
tire here and the new expect our new
tire<00:00:33.270> is<00:00:33.510> two<00:00:33.690> inches<00:00:33.960> wider<00:00:34.460> inevitably<00:00:35.460> when

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640 
tire is two inches wider inevitably when

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:37.160 
tire is two inches wider inevitably when
you<00:00:35.700> have<00:00:35.820> more<00:00:35.969> surface<00:00:36.420> area<00:00:36.719> you're<00:00:37.079> gonna

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:37.170 
you have more surface area you're gonna

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:38.869 
you have more surface area you're gonna
have<00:00:37.320> more<00:00:37.440> weight<00:00:37.680> it's<00:00:37.920> also<00:00:38.100> ten<00:00:38.460> percent

00:00:38.869 --> 00:00:38.879 
have more weight it's also ten percent

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:41.180 
have more weight it's also ten percent
heavier<00:00:39.090> so<00:00:39.750> that<00:00:40.230> actually<00:00:40.770> is<00:00:40.890> going<00:00:40.980> to<00:00:41.100> be

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:41.190 
heavier so that actually is going to be

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:43.610 
heavier so that actually is going to be
quite<00:00:41.730> a<00:00:41.760> challenge<00:00:42.110> for<00:00:43.110> the<00:00:43.170> mechanics

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620 
quite a challenge for the mechanics

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:45.830 
quite a challenge for the mechanics
during<00:00:43.890> the<00:00:43.980> pit<00:00:44.129> stop<00:00:44.160> I'm<00:00:45.059> glad<00:00:45.390> that<00:00:45.719> I'm

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840 
during the pit stop I'm glad that I'm

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:47.330 
during the pit stop I'm glad that I'm
driving<00:00:46.079> the<00:00:46.350> car<00:00:46.530> rather<00:00:46.890> than<00:00:46.980> having<00:00:47.160> to

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340 
driving the car rather than having to

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:50.000 
driving the car rather than having to
lift<00:00:47.910> that<00:00:48.030> on<00:00:48.300> as<00:00:49.050> we<00:00:49.260> move<00:00:49.410> along<00:00:49.530> the<00:00:49.800> car

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010 
lift that on as we move along the car

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:51.529 
lift that on as we move along the car
you<00:00:50.280> can<00:00:50.430> see<00:00:50.460> that<00:00:50.730> the<00:00:50.789> wheel<00:00:50.940> arches<00:00:51.239> are

00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539 
you can see that the wheel arches are

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:53.330 
you can see that the wheel arches are
obviously<00:00:51.840> flared<00:00:52.320> a<00:00:52.649> lot<00:00:52.829> more<00:00:53.100> to

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340 
obviously flared a lot more to

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:55.760 
obviously flared a lot more to
accommodate<00:00:53.910> that<00:00:54.090> much<00:00:54.360> wider<00:00:54.660> tire<00:00:55.140> so

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770 
accommodate that much wider tire so

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:57.529 
accommodate that much wider tire so
visually<00:00:56.370> that<00:00:56.640> should<00:00:56.850> stand<00:00:57.030> out<00:00:57.270> for<00:00:57.449> the

00:00:57.529 --> 00:00:57.539 
visually that should stand out for the

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:00.619 
visually that should stand out for the
spectators<00:00:58.820> we<00:00:59.820> have<00:00:59.940> something<00:01:00.239> here<00:01:00.390> quite

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:00.629 
spectators we have something here quite

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:02.330 
spectators we have something here quite
familiar<00:01:00.989> it's<00:01:01.170> a<00:01:01.230> wheel<00:01:01.410> obviously<00:01:02.190> not<00:01:02.309> a

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
familiar it's a wheel obviously not a

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:03.470 
familiar it's a wheel obviously not a
wheel<00:01:02.550> that<00:01:02.579> goes<00:01:02.820> in<00:01:02.969> the<00:01:03.059> corner<00:01:03.180> it's<00:01:03.449> a

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
wheel that goes in the corner it's a

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:05.600 
wheel that goes in the corner it's a
steering<00:01:03.780> wheel<00:01:03.809> and<00:01:04.080> new<00:01:04.650> for<00:01:04.890> this<00:01:04.979> year<00:01:05.040> we

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:07.439 
have the semi automatic gearbox very

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:10.670 
have the semi automatic gearbox very
simple<00:01:07.830> right<00:01:08.610> paddle<00:01:08.850> for<00:01:09.150> up<00:01:09.350> left<00:01:10.350> paddle

simple right paddle for up left paddle

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:13.039 
simple right paddle for up left paddle
for<00:01:10.830> down<00:01:10.979> and<00:01:11.250> then<00:01:12.030> the<00:01:12.180> normal<00:01:12.510> array<00:01:12.930> of

for down and then the normal array of
buttons<00:01:13.409> that<00:01:13.619> are<00:01:13.650> needed<00:01:13.979> in<00:01:14.130> DTM<00:01:14.820> so<00:01:15.150> speed

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.450 
buttons that are needed in DTM so speed

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:19.070 
buttons that are needed in DTM so speed
control<00:01:15.810> and<00:01:16.170> neutral<00:01:16.799> and<00:01:17.040> the<00:01:17.369> lights<00:01:18.080> this

car<00:01:19.350> is<00:01:19.530> a<00:01:19.560> coupie<00:01:19.950> so<00:01:20.220> it's<00:01:20.340> a<00:01:20.400> two-door

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
car is a coupie so it's a two-door

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:22.940 
car is a coupie so it's a two-door
versus<00:01:21.509> the<00:01:21.689> old<00:01:21.900> configuration<00:01:22.530> of<00:01:22.619> DTM

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
versus the old configuration of DTM

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:24.530 
versus the old configuration of DTM
which<00:01:23.189> was<00:01:23.340> four-door

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
which was four-door

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:26.090 
which was four-door
not<00:01:24.869> so<00:01:24.960> good<00:01:25.049> for<00:01:25.110> taking<00:01:25.439> passengers<00:01:25.590> but

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
not so good for taking passengers but

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:28.399 
not so good for taking passengers but
very<00:01:26.759> good<00:01:26.880> for<00:01:26.939> the<00:01:27.150> race<00:01:27.270> track<00:01:27.540> and<00:01:27.780> then

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:28.409 
very good for the race track and then

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:30.710 
very good for the race track and then
moving<00:01:28.680> along<00:01:29.009> to<00:01:29.220> the<00:01:29.460> rear<00:01:29.640> of<00:01:29.790> the<00:01:29.880> car<00:01:30.090> what

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720 
moving along to the rear of the car what

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:32.359 
moving along to the rear of the car what
we<00:01:30.840> have<00:01:31.020> is<00:01:31.200> one<00:01:31.350> of<00:01:31.439> the<00:01:31.530> standardized<00:01:32.100> parts

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:32.369 
we have is one of the standardized parts

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:34.609 
we have is one of the standardized parts
that's<00:01:32.939> in<00:01:33.119> DTM<00:01:33.479> in<00:01:33.780> the<00:01:34.200> interest<00:01:34.530> of

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:34.619 
that's in DTM in the interest of

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:36.710 
that's in DTM in the interest of
controlling<00:01:34.979> costs<00:01:35.549> we<00:01:36.119> have<00:01:36.150> a<00:01:36.270> single

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720 
controlling costs we have a single

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:40.039 
controlling costs we have a single
element<00:01:37.130> larger<00:01:38.130> rear<00:01:38.369> wing<00:01:38.700> with<00:01:39.390> a<00:01:39.420> huge

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:41.460 
gurney here this is what we call the

garmi on the back of the car that looks
to<00:01:43.290> me<00:01:43.320> about<00:01:43.590> a<00:01:43.649> 30<00:01:44.250> millimeter<00:01:44.430> gurney<00:01:44.880> and

to me about a 30 millimeter gurney and

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:47.590 
to me about a 30 millimeter gurney and
when<00:01:45.659> you<00:01:45.750> compare<00:01:46.079> that<00:01:46.110> to<00:01:46.520> the<00:01:47.520> old

when you compare that to the old

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:50.060 
when you compare that to the old
specification<00:01:48.600> of<00:01:48.689> car<00:01:48.869> over<00:01:49.229> there<00:01:49.380> you<00:01:49.920> can

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:50.070 
specification of car over there you can

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:51.770 
specification of car over there you can
see<00:01:50.189> it<00:01:50.280> was<00:01:50.369> a<00:01:50.399> much<00:01:50.700> smaller<00:01:50.880> multi<00:01:51.689> element

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:51.780 
see it was a much smaller multi element

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:55.310 
see it was a much smaller multi element
wing<00:01:52.170> so<00:01:52.740> overall<00:01:53.280> it's<00:01:53.970> designed<00:01:54.420> to<00:01:54.720> promote

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:55.320 
wing so overall it's designed to promote

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:57.770 
wing so overall it's designed to promote
Corsa<00:01:55.829> racing<00:01:56.250> more<00:01:56.700> cost-effective<00:01:57.390> racing

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:57.780 
Corsa racing more cost-effective racing

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:04.350 
Corsa racing more cost-effective racing
as<00:01:58.619> long<00:01:58.890> as<00:01:59.009> my<00:01:59.100> seat<00:01:59.250> is<00:01:59.369> when<00:01:59.549> we<00:02:00.149> don't<00:02:00.270> care

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:04.360 

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:07.600 

so<00:02:05.360> DTM<00:02:05.870> is<00:02:06.080> all<00:02:06.230> about<00:02:06.500> safety<00:02:07.100> first<00:02:07.370> and

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:07.610 
so DTM is all about safety first and

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:09.280 
so DTM is all about safety first and
what<00:02:07.730> we<00:02:07.820> have<00:02:07.970> here<00:02:08.000> is<00:02:08.420> a<00:02:08.479> crash<00:02:08.840> structure

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:09.290 
what we have here is a crash structure

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:10.990 
what we have here is a crash structure
which<00:02:09.470> is<00:02:09.590> actually<00:02:09.890> bolted<00:02:10.340> on<00:02:10.550> the<00:02:10.580> front<00:02:10.850> of

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:11.000 
which is actually bolted on the front of

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.450 
which is actually bolted on the front of
the<00:02:11.120> car<00:02:11.300> around<00:02:11.780> here<00:02:11.930> so<00:02:12.620> the<00:02:13.070> gap<00:02:13.220> in<00:02:13.400> the

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:13.460 
the car around here so the gap in the

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:16.300 
the car around here so the gap in the
middle<00:02:13.700> will<00:02:13.880> be<00:02:13.910> filled<00:02:14.210> with<00:02:14.390> a<00:02:14.540> v8<00:02:15.440> or<00:02:16.040> liter

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:19.760 
you have your nice mercedes-benz power

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:22.480 
you have your nice mercedes-benz power
there<00:02:20.230> keeping<00:02:21.230> in<00:02:21.350> the<00:02:21.380> theme<00:02:21.500> of<00:02:21.920> safety

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:22.490 
there keeping in the theme of safety

there keeping in the theme of safety
what<00:02:22.880> we<00:02:22.970> have<00:02:23.120> here<00:02:23.300> is<00:02:23.450> a<00:02:23.480> removable<00:02:23.990> crash

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:24.650 
what we have here is a removable crash

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:27.430 
what we have here is a removable crash
structure<00:02:25.180> that<00:02:26.180> is<00:02:26.330> bolted<00:02:26.720> on<00:02:26.840> there<00:02:27.080> so<00:02:27.290> any

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:27.440 
structure that is bolted on there so any

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:29.680 
structure that is bolted on there so any
side<00:02:27.770> impact<00:02:28.250> will<00:02:28.490> be<00:02:28.520> absorbed<00:02:29.060> by<00:02:29.180> that<00:02:29.210> and

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:29.690 
side impact will be absorbed by that and

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:31.120 
side impact will be absorbed by that and
of<00:02:29.750> course<00:02:29.960> that<00:02:30.110> can<00:02:30.230> be<00:02:30.320> replaced<00:02:30.530> afterward

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:31.130 
of course that can be replaced afterward

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:34.180 
of course that can be replaced afterward
now<00:02:32.000> this<00:02:32.810> is<00:02:32.990> actual<00:02:33.350> chassis<00:02:33.800> and<00:02:33.890> this<00:02:34.040> is

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:34.190 
now this is actual chassis and this is

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:35.680 
now this is actual chassis and this is
new<00:02:34.370> for<00:02:34.580> this<00:02:34.700> year<00:02:34.760> so<00:02:35.120> it's<00:02:35.240> a<00:02:35.300> complete

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:35.690 
new for this year so it's a complete

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:38.230 
new for this year so it's a complete
carbon-fiber<00:02:36.410> top<00:02:36.800> what<00:02:37.490> I'm<00:02:37.610> going<00:02:37.760> to<00:02:37.790> do<00:02:37.910> is

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:38.240 
carbon-fiber top what I'm going to do is

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:40.240 
carbon-fiber top what I'm going to do is
I'm<00:02:38.390> going<00:02:38.510> to<00:02:38.570> step<00:02:38.810> in<00:02:39.020> and<00:02:39.170> I'm<00:02:40.070> going<00:02:40.160> to

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:40.250 
I'm going to step in and I'm going to

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:43.500 
I'm going to step in and I'm going to
position<00:02:40.340> myself<00:02:40.760> where<00:02:41.590> I'll<00:02:42.590> be<00:02:42.740> sitting

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:43.510 
position myself where I'll be sitting

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:45.610 
position myself where I'll be sitting
obviously<00:02:44.510> it's<00:02:44.630> not<00:02:44.780> really<00:02:45.020> that<00:02:45.050> stable<00:02:45.530> at

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:45.620 
obviously it's not really that stable at

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:46.900 
obviously it's not really that stable at
the<00:02:45.680> moment<00:02:45.709> because<00:02:46.100> it's<00:02:46.340> missing<00:02:46.520> a<00:02:46.760> few

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:46.910 
the moment because it's missing a few

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:49.030 
the moment because it's missing a few
bits<00:02:47.120> but<00:02:47.810> this<00:02:47.990> is<00:02:48.110> the<00:02:48.230> position<00:02:48.709> I'll<00:02:48.890> be

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:49.040 
bits but this is the position I'll be

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:51.310 
bits but this is the position I'll be
sitting<00:02:49.250> in<00:02:49.520> when<00:02:50.270> I<00:02:50.300> Drive<00:02:50.600> the<00:02:50.780> car<00:02:50.810> so<00:02:51.230> you

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:51.320 
sitting in when I Drive the car so you

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:52.870 
sitting in when I Drive the car so you
can<00:02:51.470> see<00:02:51.650> that<00:02:51.830> the<00:02:51.920> driver<00:02:52.160> has<00:02:52.520> a<00:02:52.550> full

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:52.880 
can see that the driver has a full

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:55.780 
can see that the driver has a full
