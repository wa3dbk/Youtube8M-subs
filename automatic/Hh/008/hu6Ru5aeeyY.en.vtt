00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:08.330 
have a wider range of dynamic expression

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:11.600 
have a wider range of dynamic expression
when<00:01:09.330> they<00:01:09.540> vary<00:01:10.290> between<00:01:10.530> using<00:01:11.040> the<00:01:11.070> pic<00:01:11.370> and

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
when they vary between using the pic and

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:15.560 
when they vary between using the pic and
just<00:01:12.450> using<00:01:12.690> her<00:01:12.780> fingers<00:01:12.930> I<00:01:13.310> found<00:01:14.310> that<00:01:14.759> as<00:01:15.420> I

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
just using her fingers I found that as I

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:18.670 
just using her fingers I found that as I
tried<00:01:15.840> to<00:01:15.990> learn<00:01:16.140> jazz<00:01:16.500> and<00:01:16.860> try<00:01:17.310> to<00:01:17.369> play<00:01:17.910> with

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:22.290 
played on adjusted using a pick just

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:24.410 
played on adjusted using a pick just
didn't<00:01:22.770> get<00:01:22.920> around<00:01:23.160> enough<00:01:23.670> tone<00:01:23.910> I<00:01:24.210> was

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420 
didn't get around enough tone I was

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:30.530 
didn't get around enough tone I was
trying<00:01:24.600> to<00:01:24.660> get<00:01:24.780> sounds<00:01:25.380> like<00:01:25.500> this<00:01:29.420> it<00:01:30.420> was<00:01:30.509> a

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.540 
trying to get sounds like this it was a

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:32.150 
trying to get sounds like this it was a
nice<00:01:30.660> tone<00:01:30.900> but<00:01:31.200> the<00:01:31.530> pick<00:01:31.710> attack<00:01:31.979> was<00:01:32.130> just

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:32.160 
nice tone but the pick attack was just

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:35.270 
nice tone but the pick attack was just
too<00:01:32.460> defined<00:01:32.850> so<00:01:33.240> when<00:01:33.540> I<00:01:33.810> lost<00:01:34.470> a<00:01:34.619> pick<00:01:34.800> then<00:01:35.009> I

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
too defined so when I lost a pick then I

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:36.950 
too defined so when I lost a pick then I
just<00:01:35.670> tried<00:01:35.880> to<00:01:35.910> use<00:01:36.090> my<00:01:36.210> fingers<00:01:36.540> I<00:01:36.690> found

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
just tried to use my fingers I found

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:47.169 
just tried to use my fingers I found
that<00:01:37.080> was<00:01:37.229> a<00:01:37.290> very<00:01:37.440> musically<00:01:37.800> plays<00:01:38.130> a<00:01:38.160> result

00:01:47.169 --> 00:01:47.179 

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:49.760 

not<00:01:48.179> only<00:01:48.240> does<00:01:48.660> using<00:01:48.929> your<00:01:49.020> fingers<00:01:49.380> sound

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770 
not only does using your fingers sound

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:51.980 
not only does using your fingers sound
rounder<00:01:50.670> can<00:01:50.940> also<00:01:51.149> something<00:01:51.360> more<00:01:51.690> intimate

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990 
rounder can also something more intimate

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:54.889 
rounder can also something more intimate
for<00:01:52.740> example<00:01:53.220> when<00:01:53.399> I<00:01:54.030> tried<00:01:54.450> to<00:01:54.479> learn<00:01:54.750> the

00:01:54.889 --> 00:01:54.899 
for example when I tried to learn the

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:57.020 
for example when I tried to learn the
song<00:01:55.170> batboat<00:01:55.530> party<00:01:56.009> as<00:01:56.190> a<00:01:56.220> riff<00:01:56.490> that<00:01:56.670> really

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030 
song batboat party as a riff that really

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:02.880 
song batboat party as a riff that really
sounds<00:01:57.390> great<00:01:57.660> and<00:01:57.990> it's<00:01:58.380> a<00:01:58.470> start<00:01:58.740> of<00:01:58.890> song

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:02.890 

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:11.750 

Oh

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:11.760 

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:14.690 

oh<00:02:11.900> it's<00:02:12.900> not<00:02:13.049> nice<00:02:13.319> but<00:02:13.349> I<00:02:13.860> found<00:02:14.250> that<00:02:14.400> if

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:14.700 
oh it's not nice but I found that if

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:16.610 
oh it's not nice but I found that if
you're<00:02:15.269> stuck<00:02:15.540> in<00:02:15.689> a<00:02:15.720> song<00:02:15.959> really<00:02:16.260> softly

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:16.620 
you're stuck in a song really softly

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:18.289 
you're stuck in a song really softly
would<00:02:16.950> it<00:02:17.040> be<00:02:17.159> really<00:02:17.579> into<00:02:17.819> the<00:02:17.909> sounding

00:02:18.289 --> 00:02:18.299 
would it be really into the sounding

00:02:18.299 --> 00:02:20.360 
would it be really into the sounding
this<00:02:18.959> seems<00:02:19.200> of<00:02:19.319> fingers<00:02:19.709> helps<00:02:20.040> to<00:02:20.129> achieve

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:20.370 
this seems of fingers helps to achieve

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:33.330 
this seems of fingers helps to achieve
that<00:02:20.549> effect

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:33.340 

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:35.910 

and<00:02:33.880> finally<00:02:34.600> there's<00:02:34.870> some<00:02:35.020> songs<00:02:35.290> II<00:02:35.440> just

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:35.920 
and finally there's some songs II just

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:37.740 
and finally there's some songs II just
can't<00:02:36.220> get<00:02:36.340> the<00:02:36.459> tone<00:02:36.670> right<00:02:36.880> unless<00:02:37.420> you<00:02:37.630> use

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:37.750 
can't get the tone right unless you use

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:39.960 
can't get the tone right unless you use
your<00:02:37.900> fingers<00:02:38.290> for<00:02:38.800> example<00:02:39.250> and<00:02:39.430> join<00:02:39.670> me<00:02:39.850> is

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:39.970 
your fingers for example and join me is

players if you have pick in your hand
but<00:03:02.680> that<00:03:02.860> gives<00:03:03.100> you<00:03:03.370> 80%<00:03:04.239> of<00:03:04.660> the<00:03:04.720> attack<00:03:05.200> but

00:03:05.699 --> 00:03:05.709 
but that gives you 80% of the attack but

00:03:05.709 --> 00:03:09.780 
but that gives you 80% of the attack but
you<00:03:05.980> sound<00:03:06.280> a<00:03:06.519> hundred<00:03:07.209> times<00:03:07.420> more<00:03:07.780> round<00:03:08.790> the

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:09.790 
you sound a hundred times more round the

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:11.460 
you sound a hundred times more round the
second<00:03:10.120> one<00:03:10.239> are<00:03:10.360> called<00:03:10.600> the<00:03:10.750> claw<00:03:11.080> which

00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:11.470 
second one are called the claw which

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:13.290 
second one are called the claw which

slightly<00:03:34.269> you<00:03:35.170> can<00:03:35.350> see<00:03:35.470> from<00:03:35.650> here<00:03:35.800> slightly

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:36.670 
slightly you can see from here slightly

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:41.370 
slightly you can see from here slightly
from<00:03:37.030> your<00:03:37.180> thumb<00:03:37.390> is<00:03:37.780> so<00:03:38.530> so<00:03:40.140> what<00:03:41.140> you<00:03:41.230> want

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:41.380 
from your thumb is so so what you want

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:44.130 
from your thumb is so so what you want
to<00:03:41.440> do<00:03:41.560> is<00:03:41.769> you<00:03:41.920> want<00:03:42.040> to<00:03:42.100> find<00:03:42.340> that<00:03:42.850> length<00:03:43.840> of

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:44.140 
to do is you want to find that length of

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:45.900 
to do is you want to find that length of

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:45.910 
index finger that's comfortable for you

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:51.330 
index finger that's comfortable for you
I<00:03:46.209> find<00:03:46.930> that<00:03:48.750> the<00:03:49.750> rough<00:03:49.930> gauge<00:03:50.290> I<00:03:50.500> use<00:03:50.709> is<00:03:50.980> you

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:51.340 
I find that the rough gauge I use is you

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:53.039 
I find that the rough gauge I use is you
know<00:03:51.459> I<00:03:51.610> mean<00:03:51.790> I'm<00:03:51.880> a<00:03:51.940> right-handed<00:03:52.120> so<00:03:52.570> I<00:03:52.810> use

00:03:53.039 --> 00:03:53.049 
know I mean I'm a right-handed so I use

00:03:53.049 --> 00:03:54.509 
know I mean I'm a right-handed so I use
my<00:03:53.170> pen<00:03:53.350> to<00:03:53.440> write<00:03:53.470> a<00:03:53.620> lot<00:03:53.829> there's<00:03:54.430> a

00:03:54.509 --> 00:03:54.519 
my pen to write a lot there's a

00:03:54.519 --> 00:03:57.569 
my pen to write a lot there's a
depression<00:03:54.760> in<00:03:55.120> my<00:03:55.239> index<00:03:55.540> finger<00:03:55.870> that<00:03:56.620> gives

00:03:57.569 --> 00:03:57.579 
depression in my index finger that gives

00:03:57.579 --> 00:04:00.330 
depression in my index finger that gives
a<00:03:57.730> thumb<00:03:57.970> a<00:03:58.150> very<00:03:58.540> nice<00:03:58.870> position<00:03:59.500> to<00:03:59.860> rest<00:04:00.160> on

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:00.340 
a thumb a very nice position to rest on

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:03.360 
a thumb a very nice position to rest on
so<00:04:00.610> that<00:04:00.850> salt<00:04:01.269> that's<00:04:01.750> my<00:04:02.049> default<00:04:02.370> index

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:03.370 
so that salt that's my default index

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:11.280 
so that salt that's my default index
finger<00:04:03.579> position<00:04:08.730> in<00:04:09.730> this<00:04:10.600> position<00:04:11.049> with

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:11.290 
finger position in this position with

00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:13.650 
finger position in this position with
your<00:04:11.880> and<00:04:12.880> depending<00:04:13.329> on<00:04:13.390> your<00:04:13.510> playing

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:13.660 
your and depending on your playing

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:15.690 
your and depending on your playing
height<00:04:13.840> of<00:04:13.959> course<00:04:14.200> I<00:04:14.440> find<00:04:15.160> that<00:04:15.340> the<00:04:15.430> best

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:15.700 
height of course I find that the best

00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:18.240 
height of course I find that the best
sound<00:04:16.060> is<00:04:16.930> achieved<00:04:17.410> when<00:04:17.680> you<00:04:17.799> have<00:04:18.039> your

00:04:18.240 --> 00:04:18.250 
sound is achieved when you have your

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:20.250 
sound is achieved when you have your
index<00:04:18.519> finger<00:04:18.760> making<00:04:18.940> roughly<00:04:19.510> a<00:04:19.690> 45<00:04:19.900> degree

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:20.260 
index finger making roughly a 45 degree

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:40.000 
index finger making roughly a 45 degree
angle<00:04:20.859> with<00:04:21.039> the<00:04:21.789> strings

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:40.010 

00:04:40.010 --> 00:04:42.710 

the<00:04:41.010> cool<00:04:41.220> thing<00:04:41.430> with<00:04:41.550> this<00:04:41.760> pseudo<00:04:42.510> pick

00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:42.720 
the cool thing with this pseudo pick

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:44.540 
the cool thing with this pseudo pick
technique<00:04:43.020> is<00:04:43.139> that<00:04:43.169> you<00:04:43.500> don't<00:04:44.220> lose<00:04:44.520> your

00:04:44.540 --> 00:04:44.550 
technique is that you don't lose your

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:53.840 
technique is that you don't lose your
touch<00:04:45.030> your<00:04:45.479> pinch<00:04:45.960> harmonics<00:04:46.440> excuse<00:04:46.740> me<00:04:52.850> you

00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:53.850 
touch your pinch harmonics excuse me you

00:04:53.850 --> 00:04:55.310 
touch your pinch harmonics excuse me you
can<00:04:54.000> still<00:04:54.210> use<00:04:54.479> the<00:04:54.630> pinch<00:04:54.840> harmonics<00:04:55.229> as

00:04:55.310 --> 00:04:55.320 
can still use the pinch harmonics as

00:04:55.320 --> 00:04:56.689 
can still use the pinch harmonics as
such<00:04:55.500> a<00:04:55.560> pig<00:04:55.710> is<00:04:55.830> really<00:04:56.010> there<00:04:56.190> so<00:04:56.400> that's<00:04:56.580> one

00:04:56.689 --> 00:04:56.699 
such a pig is really there so that's one

00:04:56.699 --> 00:04:58.460 
such a pig is really there so that's one
of<00:04:56.729> the<00:04:56.790> advantages<00:04:56.880> the<00:04:57.750> other<00:04:57.900> advantage<00:04:58.289> I

00:04:58.460 --> 00:04:58.470 
of the advantages the other advantage I

00:04:58.470 --> 00:05:00.110 
of the advantages the other advantage I
find<00:04:58.710> is<00:04:58.860> that<00:04:59.010> you<00:04:59.070> can<00:04:59.220> easily<00:04:59.430> switch<00:04:59.789> from

00:05:00.110 --> 00:05:00.120 
find is that you can easily switch from

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:02.510 
find is that you can easily switch from
using<00:05:00.630> a<00:05:00.720> thumb<00:05:01.050> and<00:05:01.320> fingers<00:05:01.650> to<00:05:01.830> using<00:05:02.160> the
