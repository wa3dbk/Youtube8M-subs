 we heat oil in a pan 

00:01:01.990 --> 00:01:08.040
 when it's hot add the onion 

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:08.040

 skillet 

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:21.220

 we beat until we obtain a puree 

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:46.120

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:48.540
 heart to remove the skins and 

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:48.540
 seeds

00:02:56.780 --> 00:03:02.770

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:08.180
 thicken 

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:20.000
 At this point we remove the 

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:22.160
 fire pan and we serve 

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:24.590
