we're in the Exuma keys in the Bahamas
one<00:00:11.429> of<00:00:11.550> the<00:00:11.639> world's<00:00:11.820> most<00:00:12.030> beautiful

cruising grounds however in this remote

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:17.150 
cruising grounds however in this remote
area<00:00:15.719> there<00:00:16.170> are<00:00:16.199> a<00:00:16.320> few<00:00:16.560> aids<00:00:16.859> to<00:00:17.130> navigation

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:17.160 
area there are a few aids to navigation

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:20.240 
area there are a few aids to navigation
and<00:00:17.970> a<00:00:18.090> lot<00:00:18.359> of<00:00:18.539> shifting<00:00:18.930> sand<00:00:19.289> bars<00:00:19.560> in

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:20.250 
and a lot of shifting sand bars in

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:22.189 
and a lot of shifting sand bars in
conditions<00:00:20.850> like<00:00:20.939> this<00:00:21.090> it's<00:00:21.539> easy<00:00:21.840> to<00:00:22.080> run

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:22.199 
conditions like this it's easy to run

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:24.980 
conditions like this it's easy to run
aground<00:00:22.490> so<00:00:23.490> here's<00:00:23.730> today's<00:00:23.939> challenge<00:00:24.630> if

aground so here's today's challenge if

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:27.410 
aground so here's today's challenge if
it's<00:00:25.380> already<00:00:25.740> high<00:00:26.070> tide<00:00:26.430> what's<00:00:27.180> the<00:00:27.390> best

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:27.420 
it's already high tide what's the best

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:29.540 
it's already high tide what's the best

we're stuck on a sandbar at high tide
and<00:00:58.460> are<00:00:58.609> determining<00:00:59.210> the<00:00:59.300> safest<00:00:59.750> method<00:00:59.960> to

and are determining the safest method to
get<00:01:00.440> off<00:01:00.730> the<00:01:01.730> answer<00:01:02.059> in<00:01:02.180> this<00:01:02.329> case<00:01:02.629> is<00:01:02.899> B<00:01:03.170> we

00:01:03.490 --> 00:01:03.500 
get off the answer in this case is B we

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:05.590 
get off the answer in this case is B we
pass<00:01:04.159> someone<00:01:04.489> in<00:01:04.729> another<00:01:04.850> boat<00:01:05.269> a<00:01:05.299> halyard

pass someone in another boat a halyard
and<00:01:06.049> have<00:01:06.320> them<00:01:06.500> lean<00:01:06.710> our<00:01:06.860> boat<00:01:07.040> over<00:01:07.400> this

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:08.270 
and have them lean our boat over this

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:10.240 
and have them lean our boat over this
reduces<00:01:08.840> our<00:01:08.899> depth<00:01:09.290> and<00:01:09.500> as<00:01:09.770> soon<00:01:09.979> as<00:01:10.130> we

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:10.250 
reduces our depth and as soon as we

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:12.399 
reduces our depth and as soon as we
start<00:01:10.549> to<00:01:10.700> float<00:01:10.939> free<00:01:11.270> we<00:01:11.630> gently<00:01:11.990> reverse

back into deeper water with the falling

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:17.440 
back into deeper water with the falling
tide<00:01:15.440> it's<00:01:15.830> the<00:01:16.039> best<00:01:16.250> option<00:01:16.520> since<00:01:17.149> it's<00:01:17.330> an

immediate low-risk solution if we were

is it a good idea to try to get over a
sandbar<00:01:35.030> you<00:01:35.630> may<00:01:35.810> just<00:01:36.050> go<00:01:36.200> further<00:01:36.470> at

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:36.710 
sandbar you may just go further at

like<00:01:39.649> this<00:01:39.679> it's<00:01:40.580> wise<00:01:40.880> to<00:01:41.270> post<00:01:41.479> a<00:01:41.659> lookout<00:01:41.810> at

like this it's wise to post a lookout at

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:44.649 
like this it's wise to post a lookout at
the<00:01:42.409> bow<00:01:42.560> or<00:01:42.860> aloft<00:01:43.250> to<00:01:43.670> improve<00:01:44.060> your<00:01:44.090> view<00:01:44.539> of

00:01:44.649 --> 00:01:44.659 
the bow or aloft to improve your view of

the bow or aloft to improve your view of
what<00:01:44.840> lies<00:01:45.020> ahead<00:01:45.520> but<00:01:46.520> most<00:01:46.729> important<00:01:47.240> of

00:01:47.289 --> 00:01:47.299 
what lies ahead but most important of

00:01:47.299 --> 00:01:49.359 
what lies ahead but most important of
all<00:01:47.450> is<00:01:47.659> to<00:01:47.929> carry<00:01:48.170> up<00:01:48.409> to<00:01:48.440> date<00:01:48.770> charts<00:01:49.190> and

00:01:49.359 --> 00:01:49.369 
all is to carry up to date charts and

00:01:49.369 --> 00:01:51.340 
all is to carry up to date charts and
study<00:01:49.789> them<00:01:50.030> well<00:01:50.060> so<00:01:50.840> you're<00:01:51.020> aware<00:01:51.110> of

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:51.350 
study them well so you're aware of

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:55.119 
study them well so you're aware of
conditions<00:01:51.950> and<00:01:52.069> are<00:01:52.340> prepared<00:01:52.789> for<00:01:52.850> them
