hello youtubers Andy here from GAA
techcom<00:00:04.319> thought<00:00:04.980> I'd<00:00:05.100> just<00:00:05.310> give<00:00:05.520> you<00:00:05.670> a<00:00:05.700> very

00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:05.940 
techcom thought I'd just give you a very

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:09.140 
techcom thought I'd just give you a very
quick<00:00:06.180> video<00:00:06.710> into<00:00:07.710> what<00:00:08.189> you<00:00:08.460> get<00:00:08.760> with<00:00:09.000> the

00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:09.150 
quick video into what you get with the

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:12.259 
quick video into what you get with the
new<00:00:09.420> kk2<00:00:10.110> board<00:00:10.920> we're<00:00:11.759> obviously<00:00:11.910> all

00:00:12.259 --> 00:00:12.269 
new kk2 board we're obviously all

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:16.580 
new kk2 board we're obviously all
familiar<00:00:12.599> with<00:00:14.509> the<00:00:15.509> board<00:00:15.780> would<00:00:16.020> be<00:00:16.049> LCD

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:16.590 
familiar with the board would be LCD

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:19.040 
familiar with the board would be LCD
screen<00:00:16.949> on<00:00:17.240> but<00:00:18.240> they've<00:00:18.359> changed<00:00:18.630> it<00:00:18.869> now

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:19.050 
screen on but they've changed it now

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:21.769 
screen on but they've changed it now
because<00:00:19.619> they<00:00:19.830> were<00:00:19.890> finding<00:00:20.600> possibly<00:00:21.600> that

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:21.779 
because they were finding possibly that

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:23.540 
because they were finding possibly that
the<00:00:21.810> screen<00:00:22.230> was<00:00:22.410> becoming<00:00:22.769> damaged<00:00:23.279> and

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:23.550 
the screen was becoming damaged and

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:25.939 
the screen was becoming damaged and
there's<00:00:24.090> really<00:00:24.300> no<00:00:24.630> need<00:00:24.930> to<00:00:25.140> have<00:00:25.410> a<00:00:25.439> screen

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:25.949 
there's really no need to have a screen

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:30.320 
there's really no need to have a screen
on<00:00:26.279> the<00:00:27.180> board<00:00:27.420> itself<00:00:28.730> now<00:00:29.730> they've<00:00:29.939> got<00:00:30.150> the

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:30.330 
on the board itself now they've got the

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:33.260 
on the board itself now they've got the
the<00:00:30.660> external<00:00:31.349> screen<00:00:31.679> so<00:00:32.160> obviously<00:00:33.059> that's

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:33.270 
the external screen so obviously that's

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:37.690 
the external screen so obviously that's
the<00:00:33.780> existing<00:00:34.710> board<00:00:34.920> rule<00:00:35.250> used<00:00:35.550> to<00:00:35.820> with<00:00:36.239> the

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:37.700 
the existing board rule used to with the

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:41.900 
the existing board rule used to with the
voltage<00:00:38.700> beeper<00:00:39.180> warning<00:00:39.690> and<00:00:40.670> this<00:00:41.670> is<00:00:41.820> the

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:41.910 
voltage beeper warning and this is the

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:43.340 
voltage beeper warning and this is the
new<00:00:42.090> one<00:00:42.210> so<00:00:42.420> we're<00:00:42.540> just<00:00:42.570> going<00:00:42.870> to<00:00:42.899> do<00:00:43.020> very

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:43.350 
new one so we're just going to do very

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:45.799 
new one so we're just going to do very
quick<00:00:43.710> open<00:00:44.040> in<00:00:44.160> the<00:00:44.219> box<00:00:44.460> and<00:00:44.820> then<00:00:45.690> we're

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:45.809 
quick open in the box and then we're

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:48.529 
quick open in the box and then we're
gonna<00:00:45.930> do<00:00:46.079> some<00:00:46.110> testing<00:00:46.620> later<00:00:47.120> so<00:00:48.120> this<00:00:48.329> is

00:00:48.529 --> 00:00:48.539 
gonna do some testing later so this is

00:00:48.539 --> 00:01:01.010 
gonna do some testing later so this is
the<00:00:48.719> new<00:00:50.360> kk2<00:00:51.360> board<00:00:59.510> so<00:01:00.510> first<00:01:00.750> thing<00:01:00.930> I

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020 
the new kk2 board so first thing I

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:03.740 
the new kk2 board so first thing I
notice<00:01:01.379> about<00:01:01.469> it<00:01:01.800> is<00:01:01.949> actually<00:01:02.359> feels<00:01:03.359> quite

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
notice about it is actually feels quite

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:06.260 
notice about it is actually feels quite
a<00:01:03.809> lot<00:01:04.019> heavier<00:01:04.489> although<00:01:05.489> taking<00:01:05.760> the<00:01:06.000> screen

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
a lot heavier although taking the screen

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:09.740 
a lot heavier although taking the screen
off<00:01:06.450> there's<00:01:06.659> a<00:01:06.720> nice<00:01:07.729> robust<00:01:08.729> plastic<00:01:09.330> casing

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750 
off there's a nice robust plastic casing

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:12.609 
off there's a nice robust plastic casing
around<00:01:10.040> the<00:01:11.040> board<00:01:11.280> which<00:01:11.549> is<00:01:11.670> very<00:01:11.909> very<00:01:12.090> good

00:01:12.609 --> 00:01:12.619 
around the board which is very very good

00:01:12.619 --> 00:01:14.870 
around the board which is very very good
direction<00:01:13.619> area<00:01:14.159> on<00:01:14.280> the<00:01:14.369> top<00:01:14.400> obviously

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
direction area on the top obviously

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:18.080 
direction area on the top obviously
telling<00:01:15.810> you<00:01:16.020> which<00:01:16.229> direction<00:01:16.470> your<00:01:17.130> forward

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
telling you which direction your forward

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:20.660 
telling you which direction your forward
facing<00:01:18.360> legs<00:01:18.720> must<00:01:19.020> point<00:01:19.259> you've<00:01:20.100> got<00:01:20.280> the<00:01:20.430> 8

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
facing legs must point you've got the 8

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:24.170 
facing legs must point you've got the 8
output<00:01:21.330> connections<00:01:21.900> here<00:01:22.470> for<00:01:23.009> your<00:01:23.369> your

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
output connections here for your your

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:26.899 
output connections here for your your
motors<00:01:24.689> your<00:01:24.869> ear<00:01:25.080> sees<00:01:25.670> yes<00:01:26.670> they've

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:26.909 
motors your ear sees yes they've

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:30.550 
motors your ear sees yes they've
actually<00:01:27.060> now<00:01:27.390> got<00:01:27.720> the<00:01:28.520> built-in<00:01:29.520> voltage

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:30.560 
actually now got the built-in voltage

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:35.679 
actually now got the built-in voltage
sensor<00:01:31.560> so<00:01:31.770> you've<00:01:31.890> got<00:01:32.040> a<00:01:32.070> a<00:01:32.640> 1<00:01:33.450> pin<00:01:34.490> probe

00:01:35.679 --> 00:01:35.689 
sensor so you've got a a 1 pin probe

00:01:35.689 --> 00:01:40.550 
sensor so you've got a a 1 pin probe
where<00:01:36.689> you<00:01:36.990> can<00:01:37.909> take<00:01:38.909> your<00:01:38.939> voltage<00:01:39.869> and<00:01:40.140> put

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560 
where you can take your voltage and put

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:42.530 
where you can take your voltage and put
it<00:01:40.650> into<00:01:40.890> your<00:01:40.950> on-screen<00:01:41.400> displays<00:01:42.090> that's

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:42.540 
it into your on-screen displays that's

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:45.770 
it into your on-screen displays that's
just<00:01:42.869> in<00:01:43.079> here<00:01:43.560> you've<00:01:44.430> got<00:01:44.670> your<00:01:44.780> programming

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
just in here you've got your programming

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:47.050 
just in here you've got your programming
port<00:01:45.960> headers

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:47.060 
port headers

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:50.510 
port headers
you've<00:01:48.060> got<00:01:48.299> your<00:01:48.509> IPS<00:01:49.350> header<00:01:49.740> which<00:01:50.009> can<00:01:50.340> be

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
you've got your IPS header which can be

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:52.719 
you've got your IPS header which can be
used<00:01:50.820> for<00:01:51.060> reflash<00:01:51.540> in<00:01:51.750> the<00:01:51.840> firmware<00:01:52.110> and

00:01:52.719 --> 00:01:52.729 
used for reflash in the firmware and

00:01:52.729 --> 00:01:55.100 
used for reflash in the firmware and
then<00:01:53.729> you've<00:01:53.939> got<00:01:54.090> your<00:01:54.180> ADA<00:01:54.420> on<00:01:54.659> elevator

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:55.110 
then you've got your ADA on elevator

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:57.830 
then you've got your ADA on elevator
throttle<00:01:55.649> rudder<00:01:55.890> and<00:01:56.189> aux<00:01:56.430> channels<00:01:57.000> marked

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 
throttle rudder and aux channels marked

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:00.920 
throttle rudder and aux channels marked
on<00:01:57.990> the<00:01:58.110> top<00:01:58.380> so<00:01:58.649> they<00:01:58.770> tell<00:01:59.040> you<00:01:59.189> on<00:01:59.930> the

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:00.930 
on the top so they tell you on the

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:04.609 
on the top so they tell you on the
plastic<00:02:01.320> casing<00:02:01.759> what<00:02:02.759> is<00:02:02.880> what<00:02:03.149> and<00:02:03.619> they

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:04.619 
plastic casing what is what and they

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:07.459 
plastic casing what is what and they
even<00:02:04.920> tell<00:02:05.130> you<00:02:05.570> signal<00:02:06.570> plus<00:02:06.869> or<00:02:07.079> minus

00:02:07.459 --> 00:02:07.469 
even tell you signal plus or minus

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:10.190 
even tell you signal plus or minus
object<00:02:08.459> pluses<00:02:08.789> in<00:02:08.910> the<00:02:08.970> middle<00:02:09.300> so<00:02:09.720> you<00:02:09.750> saves

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:10.200 
object pluses in the middle so you saves

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:10.900 
object pluses in the middle so you saves
any

00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:10.910 
any

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:15.180 
any
voltage<00:02:11.900> problems<00:02:12.830> and<00:02:13.360> obviously<00:02:14.360> the

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:15.190 
voltage problems and obviously the

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:19.980 
voltage problems and obviously the
speaker<00:02:16.190> the<00:02:16.940> sounder<00:02:17.480> for<00:02:17.990> the<00:02:18.830> board

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:19.990 
speaker the sounder for the board

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:22.360 
speaker the sounder for the board
buzzing<00:02:20.990> you<00:02:21.200> when<00:02:21.500> it<00:02:21.650> gets<00:02:21.800> the<00:02:22.010> low<00:02:22.160> voltage

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:22.370 
buzzing you when it gets the low voltage

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:23.800 
buzzing you when it gets the low voltage
that<00:02:22.700> actually<00:02:23.150> built<00:02:23.360> him<00:02:23.540> but<00:02:23.690> that

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:23.810 
that actually built him but that

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:26.020 
that actually built him but that
actually<00:02:24.110> feels<00:02:24.350> quite<00:02:24.680> heavy<00:02:24.740> but<00:02:25.040> we<00:02:25.430> will

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:26.030 
actually feels quite heavy but we will

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:28.660 
actually feels quite heavy but we will
come<00:02:26.240> to<00:02:26.360> that<00:02:26.420> bit<00:02:26.870> back<00:02:27.230> a<00:02:27.260> bit<00:02:27.470> later<00:02:27.670> you

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:28.670 
come to that bit back a bit later you

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:30.700 
come to that bit back a bit later you
obviously<00:02:28.940> get<00:02:29.000> the<00:02:29.060> cable<00:02:29.660> which<00:02:30.290> is<00:02:30.320> going

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:30.710 
obviously get the cable which is going

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:33.820 
obviously get the cable which is going
to<00:02:30.800> connect<00:02:31.190> the<00:02:31.580> flight<00:02:32.180> board<00:02:32.650> to<00:02:33.650> the

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:33.830 
to connect the flight board to the

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:36.630 
to connect the flight board to the
programmer

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:36.640 

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:39.850 

you've<00:02:37.640> got<00:02:37.760> the<00:02:37.880> pins<00:02:38.720> here<00:02:39.170> and<00:02:39.530> on<00:02:39.710> the

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:39.860 
you've got the pins here and on the

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:45.550 
you've got the pins here and on the
little<00:02:40.070> connector<00:02:40.750> there<00:02:41.750> is<00:02:41.780> a<00:02:41.900> little<00:02:44.560> knob

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:45.560 
little connector there is a little knob

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:49.420 
little connector there is a little knob
you're<00:02:45.950> there<00:02:46.370> which<00:02:46.820> goes<00:02:47.120> in<00:02:47.890> in<00:02:48.890> the<00:02:49.070> recess

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:49.430 
you're there which goes in in the recess

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:50.800 
you're there which goes in in the recess
at<00:02:49.580> the<00:02:49.610> top<00:02:49.850> so<00:02:49.970> you<00:02:50.030> can't<00:02:50.240> get<00:02:50.390> the<00:02:50.450> plug<00:02:50.660> in

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:50.810 
at the top so you can't get the plug in

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:53.320 
at the top so you can't get the plug in
the<00:02:50.900> wrong<00:02:51.050> way<00:02:51.200> around<00:02:51.880> so<00:02:52.880> I<00:02:52.910> think<00:02:53.060> it's<00:02:53.300> a

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:53.330 
the wrong way around so I think it's a

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:54.760 
the wrong way around so I think it's a
very<00:02:53.450> good<00:02:53.660> idea<00:02:53.780> that<00:02:54.080> they've<00:02:54.530> now

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:54.770 
very good idea that they've now

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:58.300 
very good idea that they've now
separated<00:02:55.670> the<00:02:56.420> programmer<00:02:56.990> from<00:02:57.920> the<00:02:58.100> board

00:02:58.300 --> 00:02:58.310 
separated the programmer from the board

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:02.230 
separated the programmer from the board
I<00:02:59.240> need<00:03:00.170> to<00:03:00.440> connect<00:03:01.070> up<00:03:01.250> too<00:03:01.370> far<00:03:01.550> up<00:03:01.730> I'm<00:03:01.940> sure

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:02.240 
I need to connect up too far up I'm sure

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:03.700 
I need to connect up too far up I'm sure
the<00:03:02.510> menus<00:03:02.900> are<00:03:03.050> going<00:03:03.200> to<00:03:03.260> be<00:03:03.320> pretty<00:03:03.560> much

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:03.710 
the menus are going to be pretty much

00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:06.940 
the menus are going to be pretty much
the<00:03:03.860> same<00:03:03.980> but<00:03:04.910> I<00:03:04.940> thought<00:03:05.210> I'd<00:03:05.390> just<00:03:05.830> and<00:03:06.830> you

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:06.950 
the same but I thought I'd just and you

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:08.380 
the same but I thought I'd just and you
obviously<00:03:07.010> have<00:03:07.250> to<00:03:07.490> sync<00:03:07.790> it<00:03:07.910> you<00:03:08.030> get<00:03:08.180> some

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:08.390 
obviously have to sync it you get some

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:11.650 
obviously have to sync it you get some
long<00:03:08.570> bolts<00:03:08.960> to<00:03:09.110> fix<00:03:09.320> it<00:03:09.530> up<00:03:09.850> through<00:03:10.850> but<00:03:11.630> my

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:11.660 
long bolts to fix it up through but my

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:13.210 
long bolts to fix it up through but my
main<00:03:12.020> concern<00:03:12.470> was<00:03:12.500> it

00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:13.220 
main concern was it

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:17.380 
main concern was it
it<00:03:13.430> just<00:03:13.820> felt<00:03:14.060> weighty<00:03:14.330> in<00:03:14.600> the<00:03:14.720> box<00:03:14.960> so<00:03:16.390> just

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:17.390 
it just felt weighty in the box so just

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:24.340 
it just felt weighty in the box so just
gonna<00:03:17.600> quickly<00:03:18.850> way<00:03:19.850> the<00:03:20.270> old<00:03:20.450> one<00:03:22.750> so<00:03:23.750> the<00:03:23.930> old

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:24.350 
gonna quickly way the old one so the old

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:28.360 
gonna quickly way the old one so the old
one<00:03:25.990> the<00:03:26.990> old<00:03:27.140> one<00:03:27.230> but<00:03:27.560> the<00:03:27.680> sounder<00:03:28.220> is

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:28.370 
one the old one but the sounder is

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:32.770 
one the old one but the sounder is
twenty<00:03:29.090> point<00:03:29.360> seven<00:03:29.930> grams<00:03:30.320> and<00:03:31.330> the<00:03:32.330> new<00:03:32.570> one

00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:32.780 
twenty point seven grams and the new one

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:38.230 
twenty point seven grams and the new one
in<00:03:33.020> its<00:03:33.200> box<00:03:33.500> is<00:03:35.620> 33<00:03:36.620> grams<00:03:36.980> in<00:03:37.400> its<00:03:37.550> entirety

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:38.240 
in its box is 33 grams in its entirety

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:42.640 
in its box is 33 grams in its entirety
but<00:03:39.230> you<00:03:39.380> are<00:03:39.560> gonna<00:03:39.800> have<00:03:40.100> to<00:03:40.280> use<00:03:41.170> long<00:03:42.170> bowls

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:42.650 
but you are gonna have to use long bowls

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:44.680 
but you are gonna have to use long bowls
and<00:03:42.950> they<00:03:43.040> give<00:03:43.310> you<00:03:43.490> steel<00:03:43.820> bolts<00:03:44.360> and<00:03:44.540> these

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:44.690 
and they give you steel bolts and these

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:48.210 
and they give you steel bolts and these
steel<00:03:45.020> bolts<00:03:45.730> they're<00:03:46.730> still<00:03:47.060> faults<00:03:47.540> with

00:03:48.210 --> 00:03:48.220 
steel bolts they're still faults with

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:53.230 
steel bolts they're still faults with
nylock<00:03:49.630> nuts<00:03:50.630> and<00:03:51.160> they<00:03:52.160> go<00:03:52.400> another<00:03:52.700> seven

00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:53.240 
nylock nuts and they go another seven

00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:59.400 
nylock nuts and they go another seven
and<00:03:53.360> a<00:03:53.390> half<00:03:53.450> grams<00:03:54.110> so<00:03:54.880> all<00:03:55.880> up<00:03:56.330> that's<00:03:57.310> 40.5

00:03:59.400 --> 00:03:59.410 
and a half grams so all up that's 40.5

00:03:59.410 --> 00:04:03.970 
and a half grams so all up that's 40.5
where<00:04:00.410> this<00:04:00.680> one<00:04:01.750> if<00:04:02.750> obviously<00:04:03.560> not<00:04:03.860> gonna

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:03.980 
where this one if obviously not gonna

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:06.580 
where this one if obviously not gonna
used<00:04:04.250> on<00:04:04.430> bolts<00:04:04.790> like<00:04:04.880> that's<00:04:05.290> 20.6<00:04:06.290> with

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:06.590 
used on bolts like that's 20.6 with

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:08.590 
used on bolts like that's 20.6 with
those<00:04:06.800> long<00:04:07.070> bolts<00:04:07.490> takes<00:04:07.760> it<00:04:07.880> up<00:04:07.970> to<00:04:08.000> twenty

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:08.600 
those long bolts takes it up to twenty

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:11.680 
those long bolts takes it up to twenty
eight<00:04:08.810> point<00:04:09.200> one<00:04:09.400> so<00:04:10.400> there's<00:04:10.850> quite<00:04:11.120> a<00:04:11.180> lot<00:04:11.450> a

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:11.690 
eight point one so there's quite a lot a

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:16.420 
eight point one so there's quite a lot a
lot<00:04:11.900> of<00:04:12.020> difference<00:04:14.920> I'd<00:04:15.920> obviously<00:04:16.100> that

00:04:16.420 --> 00:04:16.430 
lot of difference I'd obviously that

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:18.550 
lot of difference I'd obviously that
this<00:04:16.580> screen<00:04:17.060> only<00:04:17.359> has<00:04:17.780> to<00:04:17.930> be<00:04:18.020> plugged<00:04:18.290> into

00:04:18.550 --> 00:04:18.560 
this screen only has to be plugged into

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:20.229 
this screen only has to be plugged into
the<00:04:18.770> board<00:04:19.040> when<00:04:19.340> your<00:04:19.489> program<00:04:19.940> it<00:04:20.090> when

00:04:20.229 --> 00:04:20.239 
the board when your program it when

00:04:20.239 --> 00:04:22.930 
the board when your program it when
you're<00:04:20.390> flying<00:04:20.720> you<00:04:21.650> would<00:04:21.830> detach<00:04:22.190> these<00:04:22.640> two

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:22.940 
you're flying you would detach these two

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:24.170 
you're flying you would detach these two
parts

00:04:24.170 --> 00:04:24.180 
parts

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:26.740 
parts
just<00:04:24.360> leave<00:04:24.570> this<00:04:24.780> in<00:04:24.840> your<00:04:25.590> in<00:04:25.770> copter<00:04:26.340> I

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:26.750 
just leave this in your in copter I

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:29.390 
just leave this in your in copter I
assume<00:04:27.750> the<00:04:27.990> balls<00:04:28.229> pretty<00:04:28.710> much<00:04:28.919> the<00:04:29.130> same

00:04:29.390 --> 00:04:29.400 
assume the balls pretty much the same

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:31.580 
assume the balls pretty much the same
there<00:04:30.270> are<00:04:30.389> some<00:04:30.570> screwed<00:04:30.900> under<00:04:31.229> the<00:04:31.350> sticky

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:31.590 
there are some screwed under the sticky

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:33.650 
there are some screwed under the sticky
label<00:04:32.070> that<00:04:32.280> if<00:04:32.400> you<00:04:32.550> wanted<00:04:32.880> to<00:04:33.030> separate<00:04:33.479> the

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:33.660 
label that if you wanted to separate the

00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:36.200 
label that if you wanted to separate the
two<00:04:34.039> plastic<00:04:35.039> housings<00:04:35.550> to<00:04:35.729> get<00:04:35.850> into<00:04:36.120> the

00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:36.210 
two plastic housings to get into the

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:39.830 
two plastic housings to get into the
board<00:04:36.509> there's<00:04:37.400> filters<00:04:38.400> to<00:04:39.000> two<00:04:39.600> hidden

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:39.840 
board there's filters to two hidden

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:42.830 
board there's filters to two hidden
screws<00:04:40.320> or<00:04:40.500> maybe<00:04:40.710> one<00:04:41.100> hidden<00:04:41.550> screw<00:04:41.940> below

the sticky label there to get you into
the<00:04:46.380> board<00:04:46.620> so<00:04:47.460> I'm<00:04:47.490> gonna<00:04:47.759> in<00:04:48.539> a<00:04:48.690> later<00:04:48.870> video

00:04:49.450 --> 00:04:49.460 
the board so I'm gonna in a later video

00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:52.850 
the board so I'm gonna in a later video
far<00:04:50.460> up<00:04:50.729> and<00:04:50.940> see<00:04:51.120> what<00:04:51.270> menus<00:04:51.660> we<00:04:51.810> get<00:04:52.050> but<00:04:52.320> the
