 to make it a positive game 

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:29.630

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:55.129
 poker combination or rather tell you 

00:00:51.949 --> 00:00:58.820
 how they play a lot of plus 

00:00:55.129 --> 00:01:01.910
 poker players and let's start the eldest 

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:04.820
 royal flush combinations of cis-3 flash they 

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:07.759
 there are extremely rare especially the first one 

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:11.140
 every 600 thousand hands but still if 

00:01:07.759 --> 00:01:14.110
 it seemed to you to see them then become 

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:17.259
 super calm super tight player 

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:17.259
 no aggression 

00:01:17.619 --> 00:01:24.700
 let the rival do everything himself 

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:27.290
 wants bluffing check and no taly 

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:29.450
 let him do all your purpose 

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:31.130
 put an opponent to sleep and give him the opportunity 

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:33.770
 catch your flash 

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:36.890
 what happens most often with such 

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:39.680
 combinations but further rearrange it 

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:42.020
 the very last move and draw out 

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:43.610
 for more chips from it these combinations 

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:45.560
 it's easiest to play 

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:47.960
 and brown is full house and you can also say 

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:50.700
 most need to deploy them the same way 

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:53.890
 fear nothing 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:55.750
 if fate already has an opponent 

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:58.270
 full house is older but it happens very much 

00:01:55.750 --> 00:02:00.280
 rarely and your earnings will not affect 

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:04.180
 strongly in the long run if you 

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:07.000
 caught flash here already need to think 

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:08.860
 a bit if your flash is from small cards then 

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.630
 don't give your opponent a cheap look 

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:13.030
 he can have the next card 

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:15.670
 an ace or king of your suit and if 

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:18.280
 the fourth card of your suit will open 

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:21.100
 you got all the money his flash will 

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:22.739
 older but if you flash that zones or 

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:24.850
 the king is afraid of nothing 

00:02:22.739 --> 00:02:30.400
 very rarely flash rock area 

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:33.190
 loses with an ace almost never only 

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:36.970
 straight flush can beat 

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:39.340
 your flash drive home but it happens extremely 

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:43.150
 rarely can you say the same 

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:45.550
 as flash and only in the line you need more 

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:46.840
 and look to the opponent did not get 

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:48.790
 cards for free 

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:51.850
 if there is a suspicion that he is going to 

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:53.860
 flash so be straight 

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:56.070
 careful better upload to the bank 

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:58.959
 more money so he goes aside 

00:02:56.070 --> 00:03:03.340
 otherwise you yourself can fall for everything 

00:02:58.959 --> 00:03:06.930
 no money resets astrid 

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:10.720
 and the most interesting running combinations and 

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:12.940
 so a set or three of the same usually happens 

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:15.730
 that you have a pair of identical twos 

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:18.640
 ten and so on and on the flop 

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:21.549
 Your card opens i was set 

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:24.370
 happy event even happier if u 

00:03:21.549 --> 00:03:26.200
 rival two pair or he decided to go for 

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:28.420
 flash or streak you can only 

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:30.519
 load the bank in order by the chances 

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:33.970
 the opponent was unprofitable to go further 

00:03:30.519 --> 00:03:36.100
 you can download and a little so that he 

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:39.010
 invested in a bank 

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:41.320
 even if he catches straight or flush that 

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:43.690
 you have a 25 percent chance that 

00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:46.590
 full house will open and then all the money 

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:50.400
 You have an opponent if your set 

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:52.470
 clogs the remaining then this fate is nowhere 

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:55.580
 it does not get around and do not pay for 

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:59.280
 this attention is this probability theory 

00:03:55.580 --> 00:04:01.800
 further two pairs are also a great combination 

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:04.950
 Texas Hold'em needs to be played 

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:07.110
 It is also exactly the same as the set only 

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:11.970
 bank need to load more money 

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:13.940
 to pull or pull a full house 

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:17.130
 you are less likely 

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:20.220
 the pair is most common on the flop 

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:21.329
 if you have an older couple then we load 

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:23.910
 bigger bank 

00:04:21.329 --> 00:04:26.610
 do not let the opponent go further and cheap 

00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:30.030
 catch either flash or two pair or straight 

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:32.550
 if you are not the eldest couple here need 

00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:35.010
 be especially careful especially if 

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:38.370
 against you two or three players 

00:04:35.010 --> 00:04:40.620
 the probability that they have something higher is great 

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:43.830
 therefore it is better to check or a little 

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:45.630
 load the bank and see what 

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:48.150
 the opponent will go on and on 

00:04:45.630 --> 00:04:50.250
 make positive decisions and last 

00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:53.070
 a combination that I often meet 

00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:57.570
 so I call it they do not fuck or again 

00:04:53.070 --> 00:04:59.340
 bluff usually with her or check or go 

00:04:57.570 --> 00:05:00.360
 volyn take away all that in the bank something 

00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:03.389
 pull in this combination 

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:08.130
 meaningless it can be costly and 

00:05:03.389 --> 00:05:08.760
 and on the river we will not be strong 

00:05:08.130 --> 00:05:12.150
 combination 

00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:15.090
 so that a check or fold or bluff Owen 

00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:17.400
 differently negative game well and last 

00:05:15.090 --> 00:05:19.500
 as if the combination of this flush draw or 

00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:22.169
 straight draw i mean when you are missing 

00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:25.860
 one card on hand for a flash or 

00:05:22.169 --> 00:05:28.020

00:05:28.020 --> 00:05:31.979
 maximum minimum money and when 

00:05:30.150 --> 00:05:33.960
 caught sitting and laying in wait and let 

00:05:31.979 --> 00:05:36.599

00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:38.639
