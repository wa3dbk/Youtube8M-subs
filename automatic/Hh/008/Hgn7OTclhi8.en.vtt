00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:19.450 
number four nude in general this is the

00:00:19.450 --> 00:00:21.030 
number four nude in general this is the
way<00:00:19.600> that<00:00:19.900> the<00:00:19.960> packaging<00:00:20.500> looks<00:00:20.770> like

00:00:21.030 --> 00:00:21.040 
way that the packaging looks like

00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:23.870 
way that the packaging looks like
basically<00:00:21.820> there<00:00:22.210> is<00:00:22.240> here<00:00:22.750> a<00:00:22.780> little<00:00:23.110> thingy

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:23.880 
basically there is here a little thingy

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:26.490 
basically there is here a little thingy
that<00:00:24.880> you<00:00:24.910> have<00:00:25.150> to<00:00:25.300> press<00:00:25.600> and<00:00:25.900> it<00:00:25.960> opens<00:00:26.350> up

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:26.500 
that you have to press and it opens up

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:29.610 
that you have to press and it opens up
so<00:00:26.920> basic<00:00:27.190> is<00:00:27.430> pure<00:00:27.730> plastic<00:00:28.030> I<00:00:28.780> must<00:00:29.470> say<00:00:29.590> that

00:00:29.610 --> 00:00:29.620 
so basic is pure plastic I must say that

00:00:29.620 --> 00:00:32.819 
so basic is pure plastic I must say that
the<00:00:29.830> packaging<00:00:30.340> is<00:00:30.490> not<00:00:30.730> very<00:00:31.150> good<00:00:31.829> it

00:00:32.819 --> 00:00:32.829 
the packaging is not very good it

00:00:32.829 --> 00:00:38.459 
the packaging is not very good it
contains<00:00:33.489> a<00:00:34.440> 4.5<00:00:35.440> grams<00:00:35.699> and<00:00:36.899> it's<00:00:37.899> look

00:00:38.459 --> 00:00:38.469 
contains a 4.5 grams and it's look

00:00:38.469 --> 00:00:40.619 
contains a 4.5 grams and it's look
basically<00:00:38.829> the<00:00:39.609> shape<00:00:39.820> is<00:00:40.089> basically<00:00:40.420> like

shades buy yours about 40 pounds but

00:01:31.899 --> 00:01:33.599

00:01:52.849 --> 00:01:52.859 
at the first one now which is this I

00:01:52.859 --> 00:01:54.959 
at the first one now which is this I
don't<00:01:53.859> know<00:01:53.950> whether<00:01:54.159> you<00:01:54.399> will<00:01:54.579> see<00:01:54.789> because

00:01:54.959 --> 00:01:54.969 
don't know whether you will see because

00:01:54.969 --> 00:01:56.760 
don't know whether you will see because
the<00:01:55.210> pigmentation<00:01:55.899> as<00:01:56.020> I<00:01:56.049> said<00:01:56.320> is<00:01:56.439> really

the pigmentation as I said is really

00:01:56.770 --> 00:01:59.999 
the pigmentation as I said is really
really<00:01:57.219> not<00:01:57.460> hoarder<00:01:58.030> so<00:01:58.420> it's<00:01:59.170> a<00:01:59.530> basically

00:01:59.999 --> 00:02:00.009 
really not hoarder so it's a basically

00:02:00.009 --> 00:02:05.510 
really not hoarder so it's a basically
more<00:02:00.280> like<00:02:00.460> in<00:02:00.670> highlighter<00:02:01.270> the<00:02:01.929> second<00:02:02.439> one

a<00:02:14.960> third<00:02:15.470> one<00:02:15.970> which<00:02:16.970> is<00:02:17.150> a<00:02:17.180> brown<00:02:17.450> I<00:02:19.570> know<00:02:20.570> okay

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:21.260 
a third one which is a brown I know okay

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:24.670 
a third one which is a brown I know okay
but<00:02:21.560> the<00:02:22.520> pigmentation<00:02:23.300> as<00:02:23.960> I<00:02:24.020> said<00:02:24.380> is<00:02:24.650> not

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:24.680 
but the pigmentation as I said is not

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:27.790 
but the pigmentation as I said is not
particularly<00:02:25.400> good<00:02:25.730> though<00:02:26.120> I<00:02:26.450> mean<00:02:26.990> if<00:02:27.650> you

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:27.800 
particularly good though I mean if you

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:29.920 
particularly good though I mean if you
are<00:02:27.920> in<00:02:28.070> a<00:02:28.160> super<00:02:28.580> budget<00:02:29.120> this<00:02:29.510> could<00:02:29.750> be<00:02:29.900> a

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:29.930 
are in a super budget this could be a

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:31.930 
are in a super budget this could be a
good<00:02:30.140> idea<00:02:30.560> because<00:02:30.890> you<00:02:31.580> will<00:02:31.760> have<00:02:31.880> the

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:31.940 
good idea because you will have the

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:35.949 
good idea because you will have the
three<00:02:32.240> colors<00:02:32.510> and<00:02:33.520> here<00:02:34.520> and<00:02:34.730> the<00:02:35.480> back<00:02:35.690> it

00:02:35.949 --> 00:02:35.959 
three colors and here and the back it

00:02:35.959 --> 00:02:38.410 
three colors and here and the back it
shows<00:02:36.200> you<00:02:36.530> how<00:02:36.800> to<00:02:36.860> apply<00:02:37.100> them<00:02:37.610> so<00:02:37.940> basically

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:38.420 
shows you how to apply them so basically

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:42.430 
shows you how to apply them so basically
what<00:02:38.690> is<00:02:38.810> the<00:02:38.840> typical<00:02:39.290> you<00:02:40.160> apply<00:02:40.490> the<00:02:41.440> this

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:42.440 
what is the typical you apply the this

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:46.750 
what is the typical you apply the this
one<00:02:43.870> this<00:02:44.870> at<00:02:45.470> the<00:02:45.709> inner<00:02:45.950> part<00:02:46.070> of<00:02:46.459> the<00:02:46.610> eyes

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:46.760 
one this at the inner part of the eyes

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:48.520 
one this at the inner part of the eyes
basically<00:02:47.180> make<00:02:47.480> the<00:02:47.630> eye<00:02:47.660> pop<00:02:48.050> but<00:02:48.320> the<00:02:48.410> only

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:48.530 
basically make the eye pop but the only

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:51.340 
basically make the eye pop but the only
problem<00:02:48.950> is<00:02:49.040> that<00:02:49.100> it<00:02:49.459> is<00:02:49.640> so<00:02:49.940> light<00:02:50.660> the<00:02:51.110> basic

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:51.350 
problem is that it is so light the basic

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:52.750 
problem is that it is so light the basic
you<00:02:51.410> want<00:02:51.620> to<00:02:51.709> see<00:02:51.890> anything<00:02:52.160> and<00:02:52.459> also<00:02:52.700> you

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:52.760 
you want to see anything and also you

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:55.870 
you want to see anything and also you
can<00:02:52.940> apply<00:02:53.030> it<00:02:53.270> up<00:02:53.660> here<00:02:54.350> basically<00:02:55.250> to<00:02:55.580> give

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:55.880 
can apply it up here basically to give

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:58.449 
can apply it up here basically to give
again<00:02:56.209> light<00:02:56.510> it<00:02:56.810> tends<00:02:57.020> to<00:02:57.260> open<00:02:57.860> up<00:02:58.190> the<00:02:58.340> eye

00:02:58.449 --> 00:02:58.459 
again light it tends to open up the eye

00:02:58.459 --> 00:03:02.530 
again light it tends to open up the eye
basically<00:02:59.360> you<00:02:59.840> apply<00:03:00.110> the<00:03:00.670> darker<00:03:01.670> here<00:03:02.330> and

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:02.540 
basically you apply the darker here and

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:06.870 
basically you apply the darker here and
then<00:03:02.870> in<00:03:03.140> the<00:03:03.260> crease<00:03:03.560> it<00:03:04.160> says<00:03:04.580> to<00:03:04.850> apply<00:03:05.209> the

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:06.880 
then in the crease it says to apply the

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:13.210 
then in the crease it says to apply the
basically<00:03:10.959> the<00:03:11.959> dark<00:03:12.200> the<00:03:12.470> medium<00:03:12.680> shade

00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:13.220 
basically the dark the medium shade

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:15.990 
basically the dark the medium shade
actually<00:03:14.030> what<00:03:14.239> I<00:03:14.270> do<00:03:14.570> I<00:03:14.600> apply<00:03:15.020> the<00:03:15.530> medium

00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:16.000 
actually what I do I apply the medium

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:19.690 
actually what I do I apply the medium
shade<00:03:17.000> on<00:03:17.420> my<00:03:17.690> lid<00:03:18.590> and<00:03:18.890> the<00:03:18.980> darker<00:03:19.400> shade<00:03:19.670> on

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:19.700 
shade on my lid and the darker shade on

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:21.130 
shade on my lid and the darker shade on
my<00:03:19.940> crease<00:03:20.209> actually<00:03:20.630> says<00:03:20.810> to<00:03:20.840> do<00:03:21.019> the

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:21.140 
my crease actually says to do the

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:22.870 
my crease actually says to do the
opposite<00:03:21.440> but<00:03:21.650> I<00:03:21.680> mean<00:03:21.890> at<00:03:22.400> the<00:03:22.549> end<00:03:22.580> of<00:03:22.790> the

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:22.880 
opposite but I mean at the end of the

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:27.250 
opposite but I mean at the end of the
day<00:03:23.060> this<00:03:23.330> is<00:03:23.510> more<00:03:23.780> like<00:03:23.989> a<00:03:25.810> suggestion

00:03:44.979 --> 00:03:44.989 
of everything and one that I believe is

00:03:44.989 --> 00:03:47.530 
of everything and one that I believe is
that<00:03:45.410> they<00:03:46.010> are<00:03:46.100> wearable<00:03:46.459> so<00:03:46.970> you<00:03:47.030> don't<00:03:47.299> find

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:47.540 
that they are wearable so you don't find

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:49.330 
that they are wearable so you don't find
crazy<00:03:47.930> colors<00:03:48.110> of<00:03:48.709> things<00:03:48.980> the<00:03:49.130> basic

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:49.340 
crazy colors of things the basic

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:51.340 
crazy colors of things the basic
absolutely<00:03:50.090> insane<00:03:50.420> you<00:03:50.690> know<00:03:50.810> like<00:03:50.989> you<00:03:51.200> know

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:51.350 
absolutely insane you know like you know

00:03:51.350 --> 00:03:54.789 
absolutely insane you know like you know
yellow<00:03:52.250> or<00:03:52.579> orange<00:03:53.019> it's<00:03:54.019> a<00:03:54.170> very<00:03:54.410> wearable

00:03:54.789 --> 00:03:54.799 
yellow or orange it's a very wearable

00:03:54.799 --> 00:03:57.220 
yellow or orange it's a very wearable
thing<00:03:55.190> I<00:03:55.340> mean<00:03:55.459> I<00:03:55.640> got<00:03:55.910> it<00:03:56.030> on<00:03:56.150> now<00:03:56.360> I<00:03:56.660> use<00:03:57.200> it

00:03:57.220 --> 00:03:57.230 
thing I mean I got it on now I use it

00:03:57.230 --> 00:04:00.430 
thing I mean I got it on now I use it
with<00:03:57.440> a<00:03:57.500> primer<00:03:58.120> making<00:03:59.120> my<00:03:59.209> ELF<00:03:59.480> primer<00:04:00.019> and

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:00.440 
with a primer making my ELF primer and

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:04.680 
with a primer making my ELF primer and
he<00:04:01.220> actually<00:04:01.430> extends<00:04:02.299> the<00:04:02.690> life<00:04:03.440> of<00:04:03.890> this

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:04.690 
he actually extends the life of this

00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:07.030 
he actually extends the life of this
however<00:04:05.690> if<00:04:06.260> I<00:04:06.380> don't<00:04:06.440> use<00:04:06.680> it<00:04:06.829> with<00:04:06.950> the

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:07.040 
however if I don't use it with the

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:08.680 
however if I don't use it with the
primer<00:04:07.310> base<00:04:07.579> he<00:04:07.760> just<00:04:08.000> disappears<00:04:08.510> after

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:08.690 
primer base he just disappears after

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:10.750 
primer base he just disappears after
probably<00:04:09.320> an<00:04:09.410> hour<00:04:09.530> an<00:04:09.860> hour<00:04:09.950> and<00:04:10.100> a<00:04:10.250> half<00:04:10.489> no

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:10.760 
probably an hour an hour and a half no

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:15.970 
probably an hour an hour and a half no
more<00:04:10.970> than<00:04:11.180> that<00:04:11.560> so<00:04:12.560> if<00:04:13.070> I<00:04:13.540> am<00:04:14.540> on<00:04:14.810> a<00:04:14.840> budget<00:04:14.980> I

00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:15.980 
more than that so if I am on a budget I

00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:19.810 
more than that so if I am on a budget I
go<00:04:16.820> for<00:04:17.060> this<00:04:17.239> but<00:04:17.870> if<00:04:18.739> I<00:04:18.890> can<00:04:19.070> decide<00:04:19.430> to

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:19.820 
go for this but if I can decide to

00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:20.560 
go for this but if I can decide to
splurge

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:20.570 
splurge

00:04:20.570 --> 00:04:23.710 
splurge
I<00:04:20.690> would<00:04:20.930> definitely<00:04:21.080> skip<00:04:22.010> this<00:04:22.280> and<00:04:23.120> go<00:04:23.180> for

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:23.720 
I would definitely skip this and go for

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:25.719 
I would definitely skip this and go for
that<00:04:23.930> you're<00:04:24.229> the<00:04:24.440> queen<00:04:24.650> test<00:04:24.979> because<00:04:25.400> from
