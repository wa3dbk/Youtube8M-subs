 throughout the history of science 

00:00:02.639 --> 00:00:06.839
 thousands of experiments have been done 

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:09.060
 that in order to prove a great 

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:11.370
 variety of products of all kinds before

 have served the animals many of 

00:00:13.890 --> 00:00:17.700
 these trials have been strongly 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:19.680
 criticized for his dubious ethics and the 

00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:21.930
 possible suffering that they caused in 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:23.730
 the creatures that were used by 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:27.350
 what rightly more and more 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:27.350
 question this type of practice

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:42.410
 in the 1960s biologists the 

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:44.330
 University of Pennsylvania saw that 

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:46.340
 when it was placed in a room to 

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:48.770
 an artificial model of a female turkey 

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:51.500
 the males tried to mate with her 

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:53.629
 as if it were real intrigued the 

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:55.370
 researchers wanted to know what was 

00:00:53.629 --> 00:00:57.500
 the minimum stimulus needed to 

00:00:55.370 --> 00:00:59.680
 excite the birds and for that they were 

00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:02.960
 gradually removing parts of the model 

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:05.660
 thus progressively they removed the tail 

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:08.090
 wings the legs and even the body up 

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:09.920
 that only the head was left and a stick for 

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:12.710
 his surprise still the males 

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:14.570
 they were trying to pair with her then 

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:16.640
 concluded that the head of the female 

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:18.649
 was the focus of the erotic desires of the 

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:20.960
 male since when he assembles and covers 

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:22.910
 completely is the head just the 

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:26.120
 only part of her body that he 

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:29.930
 can see continuously

 the human dose what they keep pretended 

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:47.479
 check was if with that drug you could 

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:49.490
 induce the musel a state that is given a

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:53.060
 characterized by the increase in 

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:55.880
 sexual excitement and that makes them more 

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:57.530
 aggressive the result of this 

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:59.869
 experiment was a disaster of 

00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:02.950
 public relations since the elephant 

00:01:59.869 --> 00:02:02.950
 he died an hour later

 in 1931 the psychologist wind drop that what 

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:16.180
 he wanted to create a chimpanzee as if he were 

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:18.100

 offspring as brother without differences of 

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:25.150
 species the objective of educating at the same time 

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:27.220
 a monkey and a child was to check if the 

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:30.010
 human behavior and intelligence 

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:32.230
 they were the result of education in fact 

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:33.300
 communication was especially interesting 

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:35.260
 oral 

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:37.120
 unfortunately the monkey never 

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:39.310
 he developed speech but his presence 

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:41.200
 affected the oral development of the child who 

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:43.570
 immediately communicated through the 

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:46.330
 same sounds as the monkey is to say the 

00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:47.890
 process turned out to be the opposite to the desired

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:52.090

 bring the hybridization of species 

00:02:59.239 --> 00:03:03.530
 different is not well seen by the 

00:03:01.159 --> 00:03:05.840
 scientific community an experiment that 

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:08.000
 He crossed male lions with tigers as he got 

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:11.000
 what has been called free felines 

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:13.040
 largest in the world with more than 400 

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:15.590
 kilograms in weight and 12 feet in length 

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:17.719
 these animals weigh 100 times more than 

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:20.299
 domestic cats and almost double that 

00:03:17.719 --> 00:03:22.099
 the felines that gave birth to them 

00:03:20.299 --> 00:03:24.019
 vigor and its enormous growth have 

00:03:22.099 --> 00:03:26.299
 explained by the phenomenon known as 

00:03:24.019 --> 00:03:28.819
 hybrid vigor which did not work at 

00:03:26.299 --> 00:03:31.400
 cross male tigers with lionesses as the 

00:03:28.819 --> 00:03:34.100
 offspring only reached in this case the

 at the time this in sight turned out 

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:46.140
 really disturbing this experiment 

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:48.420
 carried out in 1995 by doctors from 

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:50.700
 general hospital of massachusetts only 

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:52.739
 I was trying to study a possible method of 

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:55.349
 cartilage transplant for patients 

00:03:52.739 --> 00:03:57.209
 humans for it inserted a

 ear-shaped structure in which 

00:03:57.209 --> 00:04:01.470
 there was human cartilage on a mold

 biodegradable on the back of a mouse

 known as anti back offering without 

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:07.890
 doubts one of the typical images of the 

00:04:05.849 --> 00:04:10.290
 sci-fi movies that maybe 

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:12.610
 many never thought to see as part 

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:16.269

 [Music] 

00:04:16.269 --> 00:04:21.519
 this aberrant experiment was realized 

00:04:18.879 --> 00:04:24.370
 in the 1950s by the scientist 

00:04:21.519 --> 00:04:26.139
 Soviet vladimir of micov pioneer in 

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:28.599
 the field of organ transplantation 

00:04:26.139 --> 00:04:30.520
 employing dogs his experiment 

00:04:28.599 --> 00:04:32.139
 It consisted in mutilating a puppy 

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:34.599
 he only left his head and legs 

00:04:32.139 --> 00:04:37.270
 front then graft it in the neck 

00:04:34.599 --> 00:04:39.340
 of an adult dog the operation was a 

00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:41.440
 success in principle and when they woke up 

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:43.690
 both dogs were united for their 

00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:46.060
 perplexity itself although in principle 

00:04:43.690 --> 00:04:48.250
 they did not get along, they ended up 

00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:50.620
 get used and everyone kept their 

00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:52.569
 personality until six days 

00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:54.490
 that both heads and the body as a 

00:04:52.569 --> 00:04:57.620
 called multi dog by its author

 surgically the head of a monkey is

 say they separated the head of a monkey and 

00:05:13.729 --> 00:05:18.830
 they transplanted it into someone else's body 

00:05:16.250 --> 00:05:20.930
 monkey by the way he woke up very angry and 

00:05:18.830 --> 00:05:23.120
 violent coming to bite even

 mode operation did not last long and 

00:05:25.460 --> 00:05:30.050
 he died the next day before 

00:05:27.740 --> 00:05:32.270
 multiple criticisms that white received 

00:05:30.050 --> 00:05:34.490
 commented that people should be made to 

00:05:32.270 --> 00:05:36.979
 the idea that one day in the future the 

00:05:34.490 --> 00:05:39.050
 Head transplant will be possible and not 

00:05:36.979 --> 00:05:41.180
 was wrong to say that because the

 transplanting heads in humans the 

00:05:41.180 --> 00:05:46.610
 first operation of this nature will be
