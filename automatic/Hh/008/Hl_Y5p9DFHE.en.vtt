00:00:24.679 --> 00:00:24.689 
that I myself have made up so let's get

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:32.799 
that I myself have made up so let's get
started<00:00:25.250> we<00:00:26.250> are<00:00:26.369> using<00:00:26.579> a<00:00:26.939> one<00:00:27.450> hook<00:00:27.720> and<00:00:30.529> yeah

00:00:32.799 --> 00:00:32.809 
started we are using a one hook and yeah

00:00:32.809 --> 00:00:36.950 
started we are using a one hook and yeah
and<00:00:33.809> then<00:00:33.989> raising<00:00:34.410> black<00:00:34.770> thread<00:00:35.630> to<00:00:36.630> imitate

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:36.960 
and then raising black thread to imitate

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:47.840 
and then raising black thread to imitate
the<00:00:37.140> top<00:00:37.410> of<00:00:37.649> the<00:00:37.710> more<00:00:44.239> and<00:00:45.239> then<00:00:46.609> super<00:00:47.609> hair

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850 
the top of the more and then super hair

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:50.569 
the top of the more and then super hair
I<00:00:48.559> guess<00:00:49.559> that's<00:00:49.769> what<00:00:49.890> they<00:00:49.920> call<00:00:50.070> it<00:00:50.280> now

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:50.579 
I guess that's what they call it now

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:58.759 
I guess that's what they call it now
super<00:00:51.089> hair<00:00:55.999> just<00:00:56.999> going<00:00:57.239> to<00:00:57.300> get<00:00:57.420> some<00:00:57.769> purple

00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:22.780 

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:29.809 

wrapping<00:03:23.780> the<00:03:23.900> shirt

you<00:03:30.390> don't<00:03:30.569> really<00:03:30.840> need<00:03:31.109> to<00:03:31.230> worry<00:03:31.260> about

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:31.530 
you don't really need to worry about

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:33.170 
you don't really need to worry about
weight<00:03:31.920> on<00:03:32.099> this<00:03:32.249> flight<00:03:32.489> because<00:03:32.519> this<00:03:32.939> fun

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:33.180 
weight on this flight because this fun

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:36.410 
weight on this flight because this fun
will<00:03:33.510> sync<00:03:33.810> automatically<00:03:34.730> so<00:03:35.730> you<00:03:36.090> don't

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:36.420 
will sync automatically so you don't

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:40.009 
will sync automatically so you don't
really<00:03:36.510> need<00:03:36.780> and<00:03:36.989> I<00:03:37.200> would<00:03:37.530> make<00:03:37.709> the<00:03:37.920> UH<00:03:39.019> the

00:03:40.009 --> 00:03:40.019 
really need and I would make the UH the

00:03:40.019 --> 00:03:42.530 
really need and I would make the UH the
tinsel<00:03:40.499> longer<00:03:41.099> than<00:03:41.249> the<00:03:41.400> actual<00:03:41.969> fly

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:42.540 
tinsel longer than the actual fly

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:46.640 
tinsel longer than the actual fly
because<00:03:43.439> it<00:03:43.590> tensile<00:03:43.950> seems<00:03:44.909> to<00:03:45.180> a<00:03:45.379> swim<00:03:46.379> in

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:46.650 
because it tensile seems to a swim in

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:49.550 
because it tensile seems to a swim in
the<00:03:46.709> water<00:03:47.069> so<00:03:47.909> yeah<00:03:48.329> I<00:03:48.659> would<00:03:49.260> make<00:03:49.439> the

00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:49.560 
the water so yeah I would make the

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:51.349 
the water so yeah I would make the
tinsel<00:03:49.920> longer<00:03:50.310> than<00:03:50.459> the<00:03:50.579> actual<00:03:50.700> flag<00:03:51.150> and

00:03:51.349 --> 00:03:51.359 
tinsel longer than the actual flag and

00:03:51.359 --> 00:03:56.500 
tinsel longer than the actual flag and
they<00:03:51.420> go<00:03:51.569> look<00:03:51.689> like<00:03:51.870> the<00:03:52.049> tail<00:03:52.260> of<00:03:52.290> the<00:03:52.590> fridge

00:03:56.500 --> 00:03:56.510
