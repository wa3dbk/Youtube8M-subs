00:00:04.930 --> 00:00:07.340
 36 Cuxhaven 

00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:12.300
 the kiss of 167 sailing yachts are preparing for the regatta in the direction of Heligoland 

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:13.059
 in front 

00:00:13.059 --> 00:00:15.839
 last steps are taken on board 

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:18.249
 Tense nervousness is spreading 

00:00:18.249 --> 00:00:21.529
 we are in this regatta of the 75th 

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:23.539
 Guests aboard the witch 

00:00:23.539 --> 00:00:26.390
 the over 24 meter long carbon fiber hunting 

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:29.390
 is the largest in the Kata field 

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:33.750
 Last decisions by Skipper and Navigator regarding the upcoming release 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:36.750
 are affected 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:43.160
 punctually 8 clock is the starting signal for the first regatta field 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:48.350
 from Wilhelmshaven Cuxhaven and Bremerhaven start on Saturday mornings 

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:51.080
 the sailing yachts in the direction of Heligoland 

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:55.170
 a stiff breeze accompanies the approximately 1000 500 active ones 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:58.570
 and 3 b ambition and the fun of sailing up 

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:02.300
 the spouse and the witch still have to be patient 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:05.500
 Ben 

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:10.280
 and then it starts optimally over the starting line disturbing the witch 

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:13.730
 Ahead 

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:16.730
 The traditional North Sea Week has its anniversary this year 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:22.320
 In 2009 the regatta spectacle takes place 75 times 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:25.240
 and every year more ships are at the start 

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:28.189
 this is largely because of that both for 

00:01:28.189 --> 00:01:29.670
 Porta del Garda sailors 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:32.890
 as well as for ambitious tours sailors a possibility to participate 

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:34.220
 consists 

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:37.550
 the combination of professional the band and family regatta 

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:41.770
 they have the chance to meet like-minded people for their passion for sailing 

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:43.320
 to share 

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:44.770
 more 

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:48.970
 meanwhile, the witch has all other sailing yachts en route to Heligoland 

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:50.610
 left behind 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:54.450
 Thanks to favorable winds, the crew at this watch is not too much too 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:55.430
 do 

00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:58.200
 The optimal trim is constantly monitored 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:01.590
 and, if necessary, readjusted by millimeters 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:03.840
 Only Gutmann is the best time out 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:07.530
 and the witch's cow proves to be a well-rehearsed team 

00:02:08.299 --> 00:02:10.139
 Heligoland ahead 

00:02:10.139 --> 00:02:15.319
 after only two hours and 46 minutes, the witch 1 first winner goes through 

00:02:15.319 --> 00:02:16.159
 aim 

00:02:16.159 --> 00:02:19.429
 To take pleasure on board after a faction 

00:02:19.429 --> 00:02:22.399
 also the regatta two days later after at the Beo 

00:02:22.399 --> 00:02:27.759
 Completes the witch in the record time of 37 hours four minutes and 50 

00:02:27.759 --> 00:02:30.189
 seconds 

00:02:30.189 --> 00:02:34.469
 The regatta cases have dragged on throughout the day and so on 

00:02:34.469 --> 00:02:38.299
 it was still some time until the last ship Rena Helgoland left the lines 

00:02:38.299 --> 00:02:39.139
 can throw 

00:02:39.139 --> 00:02:43.139
 in time you can confidently let the sun shine on your stomach and 

00:02:43.139 --> 00:02:44.209
 relax 

00:02:44.209 --> 00:02:46.729
 little by little the harbor fills up 

00:02:46.729 --> 00:02:49.840
 By now the Hanse Boat Race Village has landed 

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:52.889
 and the Alexy Launch opened its doors to the sailors 

00:02:53.619 --> 00:02:57.699
 one enjoys a relaxed afternoon, asks chats, jokes or practices 

00:02:57.699 --> 00:03:02.139
 In competition that Spinach Apartments on board was probably not enough to do 

00:03:04.309 --> 00:03:07.689
 The regattas and Heligoland will start on Sunday morning 

00:03:07.689 --> 00:03:11.019
 This time, Aqua TV aboard the OTE allowed her to go with her 

00:03:11.689 --> 00:03:16.180
 the ambitious youth project offers unique regatta sailors n'diaye 

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:19.609
 Chance to take Offshore Racing Style 

00:03:19.609 --> 00:03:22.899
 Accordingly, CGT Crew is involved in every regatta 

00:03:23.629 --> 00:03:25.320
 the crew of the Uzwiler 

00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:28.499
 is on average just about 20 years old 

00:03:28.499 --> 00:03:32.529
 it is exciting that the young people also outside the regattas the project 

00:03:32.529 --> 00:03:33.879
 wear yourself 

00:03:33.879 --> 00:03:37.629
 every crew member also has a function around the project on land 

00:03:37.629 --> 00:03:42.829
 Advance Press Work Marketing Bootz Construction Regatta and travel planning everything 

00:03:42.829 --> 00:03:46.909
 is done by the cow in own direction the big goal 

00:03:46.909 --> 00:03:49.909
 the participation in the Seat Mii lifted car is 

00:03:50.999 --> 00:03:55.549
 but also all other regatta participants fight time against the competition 

00:03:55.549 --> 00:03:57.319
 and the wind 

00:03:57.319 --> 00:04:01.279
 Of course, the turning marks are the points where the kiss is too high 

00:04:01.279 --> 00:04:02.079
 accumulate 

00:04:02.079 --> 00:04:04.859
 no matter if first our good midfield 

00:04:04.859 --> 00:04:07.859
 Here everyone shows what is in him and the ship 

00:04:08.479 --> 00:04:13.389
 the next ton and again it will fight for every inch who has to be 

00:04:13.389 --> 00:04:17.120
 Ship fastest back underwater which cure is best recorded 

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:20.130
 even a small mistake can cost squares 

00:04:22.159 --> 00:04:25.639
 the 75 st Nordseewoche was a complete success 

00:04:25.639 --> 00:04:28.639
 The sailors were able to create a successful mix 

00:04:29.259 --> 00:04:31.499
 party mood 

00:04:31.499 --> 00:04:33.659
 and who was not among the guests this time 

00:04:33.659 --> 00:04:34.860
 not so bad 

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:36.490
 Pentecost 2010 

00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:39.389
 be the rest it is shot to the next North Sea week
