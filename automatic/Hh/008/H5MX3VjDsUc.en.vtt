Vahid Rosyani

00:00:07.050 --> 00:00:11.588

00:00:11.588 --> 00:00:22.017

Q: What do you think of Kido?

00:00:41.617 --> 00:01:00.850
A: He is a very strong fighter. He had the chance to win as well. I'm glad that I won.

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:34.374
Q: There was a lowblow.

00:01:34.374 --> 00:01:46.714

Q: Who do you want to fight next?

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:27.765
A: I want to have a fight like Masato. Until 3 years ago, I was doing my best as an amateur. Then I came to Japan and learned K-1 at Taiseijuku. I really appreciate my teachers at Taiseijuku. I will try harder to make the Japanese fans happy.
