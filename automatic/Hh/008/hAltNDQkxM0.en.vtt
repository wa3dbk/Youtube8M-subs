00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:02.500
 Oh 

00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:25.810
 hello everybody knows that 

00:00:24.670 --> 00:00:27.220
 so they place today I 

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:29.440
 found in a new video for 

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:30.670
 film a second tutorial when you 

00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:32.260
 could have guessed it in the 

00:00:30.670 --> 00:00:34.210
 beginning of the video is in the title 

00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:36.550
 this is going to be a tutorial to create some 

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:37.690
 fake blood for petshops why 

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:39.940
 for petshop simply because 

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:41.200
 that I do not see too much if it can be 

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:42.340
 useful to something else but hey if you 

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:44.530
 see other utilities there is no 

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:45.820
 problem so why did I decide to 

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:47.680
 make this video simply because 

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:48.989
 that halloween is fast approaching and 

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:51.700
 a lot of people are going to want to do 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:52.360
 scary horror videos with 

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:54.010
 blood etc 

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:56.769
 but everyone does not know how to make 

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:57.670
 sense tainted the petshops actually I'm 

00:00:56.769 --> 00:00:59.019
 remember last year she a lot 

00:00:57.670 --> 00:01:01.150
 of people on facebook who are 

00:00:59.019 --> 00:01:02.680
 complained because they had tried to 

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:05.650
 experience on their petshop and that 

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:07.570
 their petshop is set forever so 

00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:10.180
 here is today I will introduce you 

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:12.340
 a method that does not stain the pet shop 

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:14.920
 here I hope it will serve you 

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:16.690
 so first of all for this experiment 

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:18.220
 it must of course a pet shop 

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:19.570
 I learned a pet shop which I 

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:21.880
 not too much so that's a pitch is 

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:23.200
 obliged to double because we never know 

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:25.390
 what can happen in the experiments 

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:28.000
 you will also need a little water 

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:29.410
 really not a big thing a container that 

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.810
 can also be aluminum foil 

00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:34.450
 so me it's down an ice cover 

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:35.950
 here's rummy under let's never be too much 

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:37.050
 greedy you will also need some 

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:39.940
 food coloring 

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:42.190
 so I found my leclerc I 

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:43.660
 probably believe cholera patients 

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:45.220
 suddenly laurent food pardon it's 

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:48.040
 find everywhere you will also need a 

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:49.210
 brush we want any 

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:50.980
 personal I think everyone has a 

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:53.830
 perso at home if you are enough 

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:54.550
 flemmards and all you can take 

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:55.960
 a pipette 

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:57.610
 me that's what I 'm going to do all this 

00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:59.620
 that here and you will also have 

00:01:57.610 --> 00:02:01.080
 need a cocoa texture 

00:01:59.620 --> 00:02:04.230
 so that may be due 

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:05.450
 cocoa powder now makes me 

00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:08.520
 serve as icing sugar 

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:09.960
 so here we go we'll start all of 

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:12.180
 suite so first of all you go 

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:13.680
 take the pipette or if he did not 

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:16.170
 had you ps just take the glass of water 

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:17.700
 and you will put water in 

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:22.470
 your container in your paper 

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:24.120
 of aluminum to ajka km 

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:26.130
 there is no need for a big fat 

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:27.510
 big amount then always with the 

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:30.150
 pipe is if you have a pipette 

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:31.950
 or else bah by hand was going you 

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:34.860
 pour a few drops of dye 

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:39.890
 food in the water you just 

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:42.209
 pay in the risk of aligning 

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:43.920
 so we could conclude that this is 

00:02:42.209 --> 00:02:46.020
 the problem is that in fact the 

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:48.360
 texture is very very liquid it's for 

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:52.020
 we're going to add some icing sugar 

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:53.370
 here to make the texture not pasty 

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:54.540
 but much less liquid if you 

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:56.640
 Take icing sugar pays attention 

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:59.520
 that there are no lumps in fact I 

00:02:56.640 --> 00:03:01.140
 crashed it just quickly and so you 

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:04.350
 come on master 

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:05.760
 you put to the four think jean 

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:07.560
 doctor who because I took a little 

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:09.480
 too much icing sugar so with the brush 

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:11.640
 you will come a little mixed so 

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:14.489
 I too bring back what went on 

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:17.010
 the side and then you will be able 

00:03:14.489 --> 00:03:20.989
 take their petshop and apply to it 

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:20.989
 the fake are where you want 

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:28.319
 there you see them still a little liquid 

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:31.260
 you do not hesitate to put a little bit 

00:03:28.319 --> 00:03:39.390
 more and icing sugar that will help us 

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:40.890
 so that's normally not it 

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:41.970
 not stain you can wash with water 

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:44.069
 simply clear 

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:45.480
 and it will go well listen to the 

00:03:44.069 --> 00:03:47.069
 tutorial is over anyway I hope 

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:48.780
 that he will have and more than a year more 

00:03:47.069 --> 00:03:49.980
 of a so here you do the big thing 

00:03:48.780 --> 00:04:02.690
 kisses and see you soon for a next 

00:03:49.980 --> 00:04:02.690
 video maybe minty it was 

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:06.020
 in nine lots
