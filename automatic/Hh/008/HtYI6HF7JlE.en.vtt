we<00:00:12.990> all<00:00:13.110> know<00:00:13.290> that<00:00:13.320> polar<00:00:13.740> bears<00:00:14.040> live

00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:14.820 
we all know that polar bears live

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:16.940 
we all know that polar bears live
throughout<00:00:15.209> the<00:00:15.419> North<00:00:15.660> Pole<00:00:15.929> area<00:00:16.410> where

00:00:16.940 --> 00:00:16.950 
throughout the North Pole area where

00:00:16.950 --> 00:00:18.740 
throughout the North Pole area where
it's<00:00:17.070> covered<00:00:17.340> by<00:00:17.490> sea<00:00:17.789> ice<00:00:17.970> for<00:00:18.240> extended

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:18.750 
it's covered by sea ice for extended

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:21.500 
it's covered by sea ice for extended
periods<00:00:19.170> but<00:00:19.920> they<00:00:20.460> don't<00:00:20.670> live<00:00:20.910> everywhere

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:21.510 
periods but they don't live everywhere

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:23.570 
periods but they don't live everywhere
equally<00:00:22.050> and<00:00:22.289> there<00:00:22.470> are<00:00:22.560> differences<00:00:23.039> in<00:00:23.279> the

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:23.580 
equally and there are differences in the

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:25.820 
equally and there are differences in the
geographic<00:00:24.210> regions<00:00:24.630> now<00:00:25.080> scientists<00:00:25.529> have

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:25.830 
geographic regions now scientists have

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:28.519 
geographic regions now scientists have
defined<00:00:26.029> 19<00:00:27.109> subpopulations<00:00:28.109> of<00:00:28.259> polar<00:00:28.439> bears

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:28.529 
defined 19 subpopulations of polar bears

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:32.600 
defined 19 subpopulations of polar bears
worldwide<00:00:29.250> but<00:00:30.150> 19<00:00:30.990> is<00:00:31.199> almost<00:00:31.710> too<00:00:32.099> many<00:00:32.310> to

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:32.610 
worldwide but 19 is almost too many to

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:33.950 
worldwide but 19 is almost too many to
manage<00:00:33.060> when<00:00:33.240> we're<00:00:33.390> thinking<00:00:33.719> about<00:00:33.840> a

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:33.960 
manage when we're thinking about a

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:36.290 
manage when we're thinking about a
global<00:00:34.260> problem<00:00:34.710> like<00:00:35.100> global<00:00:35.700> warming<00:00:36.059> and

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:36.300 
global problem like global warming and

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:39.950 
global problem like global warming and
so<00:00:36.960> in<00:00:37.079> 2007<00:00:37.920> I<00:00:38.309> developed<00:00:39.180> the<00:00:39.270> idea<00:00:39.629> that

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:39.960 
so in 2007 I developed the idea that

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:41.840 
so in 2007 I developed the idea that
some<00:00:40.620> of<00:00:40.739> these<00:00:40.860> populations<00:00:41.190> are<00:00:41.820> more

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:41.850 
some of these populations are more

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:43.819 
some of these populations are more
similar<00:00:42.600> than<00:00:42.780> they<00:00:42.840> are<00:00:42.960> different<00:00:43.140> and<00:00:43.770> I

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829 
similar than they are different and I

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:46.540 
similar than they are different and I
grouped<00:00:44.160> them<00:00:44.340> into<00:00:44.370> four<00:00:45.180> different<00:00:45.600> major

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:46.550 
grouped them into four different major

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:49.310 
grouped them into four different major
ecoregions<00:00:47.550> so<00:00:48.030> there's<00:00:48.270> the<00:00:48.480> seasonal<00:00:49.110> ice

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320 
ecoregions so there's the seasonal ice

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:50.959 
ecoregions so there's the seasonal ice
ecoregion<00:00:50.039> and<00:00:50.190> that's<00:00:50.340> the<00:00:50.550> one<00:00:50.699> that<00:00:50.820> we're

00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:50.969 
ecoregion and that's the one that we're

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:53.090 
ecoregion and that's the one that we're
standing<00:00:51.360> in<00:00:51.510> here<00:00:51.690> on<00:00:51.840> Hudson<00:00:52.199> Bay<00:00:52.350> and<00:00:52.620> it

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
standing in here on Hudson Bay and it

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:55.490 
standing in here on Hudson Bay and it
includes<00:00:53.460> Davis<00:00:53.910> Strait<00:00:54.239> and<00:00:54.570> Fox<00:00:54.960> space<00:00:55.230> and

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
includes Davis Strait and Fox space and

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:57.979 
includes Davis Strait and Fox space and
the<00:00:55.800> areas<00:00:56.219> where<00:00:56.430> the<00:00:56.579> ice<00:00:56.760> is<00:00:56.789> only<00:00:57.300> annual

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989 
the areas where the ice is only annual

00:00:57.989 --> 00:00:59.990 
the areas where the ice is only annual
ice<00:00:58.170> so<00:00:58.440> it<00:00:58.559> melts<00:00:58.920> entirely<00:00:59.280> every<00:00:59.730> summer

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
ice so it melts entirely every summer

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.509 
ice so it melts entirely every summer
the<00:01:00.570> ice<00:01:00.600> melts<00:01:01.260> forcing<00:01:01.949> the<00:01:02.070> polar<00:01:02.280> bears

00:01:02.509 --> 00:01:02.519 
the ice melts forcing the polar bears

00:01:02.519 --> 00:01:05.210 
the ice melts forcing the polar bears
onto<00:01:02.879> shore<00:01:03.149> but<00:01:03.660> north<00:01:03.989> of<00:01:04.260> here<00:01:04.620> in<00:01:04.739> the

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
onto shore but north of here in the

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:07.040 
onto shore but north of here in the
Canadian<00:01:05.520> archipelago<00:01:06.060> there's<00:01:06.690> what<00:01:06.900> I<00:01:06.930> call

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:07.050 
Canadian archipelago there's what I call

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:10.040 
Canadian archipelago there's what I call
the<00:01:07.410> archipelago<00:01:08.190> ecoregion<00:01:08.940> and<00:01:09.120> that's<00:01:09.600> the

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:10.050 
the archipelago ecoregion and that's the

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:12.140 
the archipelago ecoregion and that's the
channels<00:01:10.830> between<00:01:11.070> the<00:01:11.430> high<00:01:11.640> Canadian

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
channels between the high Canadian

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:14.360 
channels between the high Canadian
Arctic<00:01:12.420> islands<00:01:13.020> and<00:01:13.140> adjacent<00:01:13.920> Greenland

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:14.370 
Arctic islands and adjacent Greenland

00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:16.880 
Arctic islands and adjacent Greenland
and<00:01:14.520> those<00:01:14.610> channels<00:01:14.970> are<00:01:15.300> choked<00:01:15.810> by<00:01:16.410> sea<00:01:16.710> ice

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
and those channels are choked by sea ice

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:18.800 
and those channels are choked by sea ice
year-round<00:01:17.280> and<00:01:17.820> so<00:01:17.910> the<00:01:18.030> polar<00:01:18.270> bears<00:01:18.510> there

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
year-round and so the polar bears there

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:20.600 
year-round and so the polar bears there
have<00:01:19.080> access<00:01:19.500> to<00:01:19.620> ice<00:01:19.770> all<00:01:20.070> the<00:01:20.100> time<00:01:20.400> they

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610 
have access to ice all the time they

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:22.220 
have access to ice all the time they
don't<00:01:20.790> have<00:01:20.970> to<00:01:21.150> come<00:01:21.330> ashore<00:01:21.450> they<00:01:21.900> spend

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:22.230 
don't have to come ashore they spend

00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:24.260 
don't have to come ashore they spend
their<00:01:22.380> life<00:01:22.560> out<00:01:22.800> in<00:01:22.830> the<00:01:22.980> sea<00:01:23.220> ice<00:01:23.430> well<00:01:24.030> much

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
their life out in the sea ice well much

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:25.940 
their life out in the sea ice well much
of<00:01:24.300> the<00:01:24.540> Arctic<00:01:24.930> is<00:01:25.080> what<00:01:25.290> we<00:01:25.380> call<00:01:25.590> the<00:01:25.740> polar

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
of the Arctic is what we call the polar

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:28.160 
of the Arctic is what we call the polar
Basin<00:01:26.550> this<00:01:26.700> is<00:01:26.910> the<00:01:27.060> area<00:01:27.390> that<00:01:27.450> centers<00:01:28.020> on

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
Basin this is the area that centers on

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:30.500 
Basin this is the area that centers on
the<00:01:28.260> North<00:01:28.500> Pole<00:01:28.590> and<00:01:29.070> is<00:01:29.760> ringed<00:01:30.120> by<00:01:30.450> the

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:30.510 
the North Pole and is ringed by the

00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:33.290 
the North Pole and is ringed by the
continents<00:01:31.350> so<00:01:31.830> it's<00:01:32.040> that<00:01:32.280> sort<00:01:32.640> of<00:01:32.790> giant

00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:33.300 
continents so it's that sort of giant

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:35.690 
continents so it's that sort of giant
mass<00:01:33.570> of<00:01:33.840> ocean<00:01:34.200> and<00:01:34.380> ice<00:01:34.530> that<00:01:34.890> we<00:01:35.340> call<00:01:35.550> the

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
mass of ocean and ice that we call the

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:38.660 
mass of ocean and ice that we call the
Arctic<00:01:36.060> Ocean<00:01:36.420> the<00:01:36.630> polar<00:01:37.620> Basin<00:01:38.100> I<00:01:38.190> divided

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
Arctic Ocean the polar Basin I divided

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:41.270 
Arctic Ocean the polar Basin I divided
into<00:01:38.910> two<00:01:39.150> more<00:01:39.420> eco<00:01:39.840> regions<00:01:40.290> one<00:01:40.920> is<00:01:40.950> the

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:41.280 
into two more eco regions one is the

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:43.820 
into two more eco regions one is the
divergent<00:01:42.060> ice<00:01:42.210> eco<00:01:42.660> region<00:01:43.050> and<00:01:43.260> that<00:01:43.380> starts

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:43.830 
divergent ice eco region and that starts

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:46.880 
divergent ice eco region and that starts
in<00:01:44.010> Alaska<00:01:44.850> North<00:01:45.180> Western<00:01:45.600> Canada<00:01:46.110> and<00:01:46.290> rings

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:46.890 
in Alaska North Western Canada and rings

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:50.030 
in Alaska North Western Canada and rings
all<00:01:47.250> the<00:01:47.280> way<00:01:47.550> around<00:01:47.970> to<00:01:48.600> the<00:01:49.380> north<00:01:49.830> of

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:54.320 
Russia and around to spall Bart and
that's<00:01:52.440> an<00:01:52.650> area<00:01:52.830> where<00:01:53.250> sea<00:01:53.700> ice<00:01:53.850> forms

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:54.330 
that's an area where sea ice forms

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:56.840 
that's an area where sea ice forms
actively<00:01:55.230> throughout<00:01:55.680> the<00:01:55.830> winter<00:01:56.160> but<00:01:56.640> as

actively throughout the winter but as

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:58.610 
actively throughout the winter but as
it's<00:01:57.090> forming<00:01:57.510> it's<00:01:57.660> continually<00:01:58.410> being

00:01:58.610 --> 00:01:58.620 
it's forming it's continually being

Basin out through Fram Strait and

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:09.169 
Basin out through Fram Strait and
actually<00:02:07.050> leaving<00:02:07.290> the<00:02:07.530> Arctic<00:02:07.920> entirely<00:02:08.340> but

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:09.179 
actually leaving the Arctic entirely but

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:11.990 
actually leaving the Arctic entirely but
a<00:02:09.239> lot<00:02:09.539> of<00:02:09.660> it<00:02:09.780> piles<00:02:10.229> up<00:02:10.649> on<00:02:10.920> the<00:02:11.460> north<00:02:11.700> coast

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:12.000 
a lot of it piles up on the north coast

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:13.350 
a lot of it piles up on the north coast
of<00:02:12.180> Greenland<00:02:12.690> and<00:02:12.840> the<00:02:12.930> north

part of the Canadian Arctic Islands and
where<00:02:15.790> it<00:02:15.940> piles<00:02:16.270> up<00:02:16.660> for<00:02:16.930> that<00:02:17.080> ice<00:02:17.290> converges

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:18.100 
where it piles up for that ice converges

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:20.250 
where it piles up for that ice converges
I<00:02:18.310> have<00:02:18.700> called<00:02:18.970> the<00:02:19.450> convergent<00:02:20.110> ice

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:20.260 
I have called the convergent ice

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:22.650 
I have called the convergent ice
ecoregion<00:02:21.040> so<00:02:21.460> in<00:02:21.610> the<00:02:21.730> polar<00:02:21.940> Basin<00:02:22.360> we<00:02:22.480> have

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:22.660 
ecoregion so in the polar Basin we have

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:25.770 
ecoregion so in the polar Basin we have
the<00:02:22.810> divergent<00:02:23.530> ice<00:02:23.650> ecoregion<00:02:24.460> the<00:02:25.330> ice<00:02:25.540> is

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:25.780 
the divergent ice ecoregion the ice is

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:28.230 
the divergent ice ecoregion the ice is
always<00:02:26.020> moving<00:02:26.560> away<00:02:26.680> from<00:02:27.220> that<00:02:27.430> and<00:02:27.700> piling

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:28.240 
always moving away from that and piling

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:31.140 
always moving away from that and piling
up<00:02:28.420> in<00:02:28.690> the<00:02:28.720> convergent<00:02:29.560> ice<00:02:29.710> ecoregion<00:02:30.550> and

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:31.150 
up in the convergent ice ecoregion and

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:33.540 
up in the convergent ice ecoregion and
then<00:02:31.420> just<00:02:32.140> to<00:02:32.350> the<00:02:32.470> south<00:02:32.740> of<00:02:32.920> that<00:02:32.980> we<00:02:33.370> have

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:33.550 
then just to the south of that we have

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:36.000 
then just to the south of that we have
the<00:02:33.670> archipelago<00:02:34.480> ecoregion<00:02:35.230> and<00:02:35.410> then<00:02:35.980> a

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:36.010 
the archipelago ecoregion and then a

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:37.950 
the archipelago ecoregion and then a
little<00:02:36.340> bit<00:02:36.520> further<00:02:36.580> south<00:02:37.180> and<00:02:37.480> east<00:02:37.720> we

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:37.960 
little bit further south and east we

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:40.530 
little bit further south and east we
have<00:02:37.990> the<00:02:38.920> seasonal<00:02:39.459> ice<00:02:39.610> ecoregion<00:02:40.330> so<00:02:40.450> we

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:40.540 
have the seasonal ice ecoregion so we

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:42.630 
have the seasonal ice ecoregion so we
have<00:02:40.660> four<00:02:41.080> major<00:02:41.440> eco<00:02:42.010> regions<00:02:42.430> that<00:02:42.580> are

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:42.640 
have four major eco regions that are

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:45.720 
have four major eco regions that are
defined<00:02:43.150> by<00:02:43.810> how<00:02:44.110> the<00:02:44.170> sea<00:02:44.560> ice<00:02:44.770> forms<00:02:45.310> and

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:45.730 
defined by how the sea ice forms and

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:47.610 
defined by how the sea ice forms and
changes<00:02:46.270> throughout<00:02:46.600> the<00:02:46.780> year<00:02:47.020> and<00:02:47.170> how

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:47.620 
changes throughout the year and how

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:50.520 
changes throughout the year and how
polar<00:02:47.920> bears<00:02:48.220> respond<00:02:48.790> to<00:02:49.060> those<00:02:49.209> changes<00:02:49.540> so

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:50.530 
polar bears respond to those changes so

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:53.250 
polar bears respond to those changes so
the<00:02:50.800> value<00:02:51.280> of<00:02:51.310> the<00:02:51.640> four<00:02:51.910> ice<00:02:52.120> ecoregions<00:02:52.930> is

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:53.260 
the value of the four ice ecoregions is

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:56.070 
the value of the four ice ecoregions is
our<00:02:53.500> ability<00:02:54.010> to<00:02:54.040> take<00:02:54.520> information<00:02:55.000> from<00:02:55.540> the

00:02:56.070 --> 00:02:56.080 
our ability to take information from the

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:58.280 
our ability to take information from the
populations<00:02:56.830> that<00:02:56.950> we<00:02:57.100> know<00:02:57.400> well<00:02:57.730> and

00:02:58.280 --> 00:02:58.290 
populations that we know well and

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:00.210 
populations that we know well and
extrapolate<00:02:59.290> it<00:02:59.410> with<00:02:59.590> a<00:02:59.620> great<00:02:59.950> deal<00:02:59.980> of

00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:00.220 
extrapolate it with a great deal of

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:02.460 
extrapolate it with a great deal of
logic<00:03:01.000> based<00:03:01.360> on<00:03:01.570> what's<00:03:01.780> happening<00:03:02.260> to<00:03:02.380> the

00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:02.470 
logic based on what's happening to the

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:04.920 
logic based on what's happening to the
habitats<00:03:03.010> to<00:03:03.670> populations<00:03:04.480> that<00:03:04.540> we<00:03:04.720> don't
