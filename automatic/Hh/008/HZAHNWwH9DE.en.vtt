let's<00:05:37.830> try<00:05:38.280> again<00:05:40.280> right<00:05:41.280> over<00:05:41.460> here<00:05:42.260> since

00:05:43.250 --> 00:05:43.260 
let's try again right over here since

00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:49.790 
let's try again right over here since
that's<00:05:43.560> a<00:05:43.770> creeper<00:05:44.400> is<00:05:44.600> dead<00:05:45.710> nah<00:05:48.410> how<00:05:49.410> are<00:05:49.620> you

00:05:49.790 --> 00:05:49.800 
that's a creeper is dead nah how are you

00:05:49.800 --> 00:06:03.779 
that's a creeper is dead nah how are you
possibly<00:05:50.510> supposed<00:05:51.510> to<00:05:51.750> get<00:05:51.930> through

00:06:03.779 --> 00:06:03.789 

00:06:03.789 --> 00:06:06.759 

maybe<00:06:04.789> maybe<00:06:05.629> a<00:06:05.779> bigger<00:06:06.199> data<00:06:06.349> to<00:06:06.619> actually

00:06:06.759 --> 00:06:06.769 
maybe maybe a bigger data to actually

00:06:06.769 --> 00:06:16.919 
maybe maybe a bigger data to actually
use<00:06:07.219> my<00:06:07.399> sand

00:06:16.919 --> 00:06:16.929 

00:06:16.929 --> 00:06:19.989 

I'm<00:06:17.929> feeling<00:06:18.289> that<00:06:18.409> there's<00:06:18.559> like<00:06:18.999> Spencer's

00:06:19.989 --> 00:06:19.999 
I'm feeling that there's like Spencer's

00:06:19.999 --> 00:06:22.589 
I'm feeling that there's like Spencer's
or<00:06:20.209> so<00:06:20.449> because<00:06:20.899> I<00:06:21.080> saw<00:06:21.259> an<00:06:21.379> Endermen<00:06:21.679> falling

00:06:22.589 --> 00:06:22.599 
or so because I saw an Endermen falling

00:06:22.599 --> 00:06:25.989 
or so because I saw an Endermen falling
out<00:06:23.599> of<00:06:23.659> the<00:06:23.929> sky<00:06:24.369> so<00:06:25.369> I<00:06:25.399> have<00:06:25.639> the<00:06:25.789> feeling

00:06:25.989 --> 00:06:25.999 
out of the sky so I have the feeling

00:06:25.999 --> 00:06:49.450 
out of the sky so I have the feeling
that<00:06:26.179> there's<00:06:26.449> dispensers<00:06:30.520> treat<00:06:31.520> treat

00:06:49.450 --> 00:06:49.460 

00:06:49.460 --> 00:06:54.140 

dang<00:06:50.460> it<00:06:50.699> i<00:06:50.940> just<00:06:52.520> now<00:06:53.520> would<00:06:53.759> be<00:06:53.790> a<00:06:53.910> good<00:06:54.090> place
