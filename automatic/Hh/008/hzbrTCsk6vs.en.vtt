 yellow / text the moya for us in 

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:07.020
 minecraft in the main screen 

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:08.580
 has built in and how you like this whole 

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:09.809
 could adapt easily and completely 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:14.240
 without mods you will experience this in this 

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:14.240
 tutorial of only 10 7 after the intro 

00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:25.360
 hello my love and cordial 

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:27.580
 welcome here for another title 

00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:29.860
 from 2007 today it is still about the 

00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:32.290
 splash text or he these yellow little ones 

00:00:29.860 --> 00:00:33.460
 funny news the mojang here in 

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:34.840
 the home screen of minecraft 

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:36.910
 we can have inserted these 

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:38.100
 quite simply change and with only a few 

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:39.880
 mouse clicks and that completely without 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:41.620
 modifications and that's why we start 

00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:43.270
 also right now and that is what we are pushing 

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:45.040
 for that windows button and he and get 

00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:46.510
 then in the window exporting here 

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:49.030
 we give percent 

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:50.470
 and have we done that click we 

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:52.630
 Enter and go to the point 

00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:54.129
 minecraft folder and now innovations 

00:00:52.630 --> 00:00:56.199
 Now you are looking for this list 

00:00:54.129 --> 00:00:57.430
 Here is a version for you that 

00:00:56.199 --> 00:00:58.809
 want to do the list 

00:00:57.430 --> 00:00:59.920
 of course, look different depending on 

00:00:58.809 --> 00:01:01.690
 which version you already have 

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:03.250
 I would say we downloaded 

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:05.080
 Just do that for the 1 7 wants 

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:07.510
 whether the fine profile in this case 

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:09.370
 and then we have different ones here 

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:11.260
 However, files needed one 

00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:12.430
 further program with 2 1 filing 

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:15.130
 programs we can do that for example 

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:17.050
 free program 7 zip or winrar in 

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:18.640
 use the test phase and then you do 

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:20.860
 just right click will open and at 

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:22.330
 me pass me in the case with winrar 

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:24.040
 and now we have it all here 

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:25.810
 opened and the file can be from 

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:27.880
 Edit us and here we find 

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:29.620
 already a bad bad tenant in the folder 

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:31.510
 which only causes problems and therefore 

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:33.190
 be deleted from us as soon as possible 

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:34.750
 should and I do that directly synonymous times 

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:36.400
 otherwise it will not work 

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:39.850
 Now we are going into assets 

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:43.330
 minecraft text and text we find 

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:45.940
 here are three text files eg special xd xd 

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:47.140
 as well as credit points we are interested 

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:49.600
 but only the special 

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:51.370
 xd think that and you just 

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:53.260
 we open this with a double click 

00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:55.780
 the editor and now we just press 

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:58.570
 we can still control these for us 

00:01:55.780 --> 00:02:00.730
 all 3 100 messages on the number you 

00:01:58.570 --> 00:02:03.100
 view or read but we click 

00:02:00.730 --> 00:02:05.560
 Just remove it and you can now here 

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:09.069
 as we would like our own message 

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:11.340
 adaptation eg 2007 or describe 

00:02:09.069 --> 00:02:14.260
 including hey hello 

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:16.180
 and already we have these adapted to her 

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:18.430
 You can expand it as you like 

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:19.870
 always so on and so on and now 

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:20.980
 you have to remember the files still 

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:22.420
 save 

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:23.980
 Did you do that one more thing? 

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:25.930
 Small message that you have the archive 

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:26.470
 would like to renew and that would like you in 

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:28.030
 the case 

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:29.800
 and now we close the whole thing 

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:31.300
 easy and start at minecraft 

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:33.730
 see if it works 

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:35.620
 we have started minecraft 

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:37.150
 now necessarily click on nhl-profi and 

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:39.370
 select the profile for that we have it 

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:41.590
 with me it was 1.745 

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:44.080
 and then we click easily 

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:46.390
 on play and now we hope that 

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:48.310
 the whole thing was taken over very easily 

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:49.270
 and there we see hey there we are 

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:51.520
 the message we have 

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:53.890
 fixed exclamation point exactly that 

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:55.960
 is in the splash xt if we are now 

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:57.340
 go a world and then again 

00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:58.750
 to leave the world then we have 

00:02:57.340 --> 00:03:00.400
 still sharks but we start that 

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:04.330
 whole just new because we have 

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:06.610
 still set 2007 as splash tags 

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:08.350
 and you also see this is displayed 

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:10.180
 sometimes there is the problem that here 

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:11.950
 such a mark that drawn as the way 

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:13.390
 unfortunately I do not know if you are 

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:14.590
 the ideas or suggestions then have 

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:15.370
 Just write that in the 

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:17.440
 Comments 

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:19.180
 a really cool feature 

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:20.320
 I, however, withhold me 

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:22.000
 I am now here again 

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:23.290
 in the splash is file and in the 

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.910
 background you see already I have me 

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:26.650
 the color table opened up for us 

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:28.330
 have the possibility the whole also 

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:30.970
 We want to write in color, for example 

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:32.800
 message for my 1007 just in 

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:34.750
 make a blue appear then packs 

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:36.640
 before that in the paragraph sign this 

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:38.709
 you can find on your keyboard on the 

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:40.780
 second occupancy of the three and now have 

00:03:38.709 --> 00:03:42.910
 we ยง 1 and already should the whole 

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:44.620
 same blue and if displayed 

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:47.350
 We would like to be able to do that , for example 

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:49.120
 again with paragraph that's the case 

00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:50.530
 the same appears in green 

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:52.180
 let and also that should actually 

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:54.520
 So start working and minecraft 

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:56.050
 same again and may I present 

00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:57.730
 Here we see already in this glaring 

00:03:56.050 --> 00:03:59.950
 green what we wanted, we now have the 

00:03:57.730 --> 00:04:01.480
 presented here and so easy 

00:03:59.950 --> 00:04:02.770
 we also write fabi if you are 

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:04.750
 you also want the possibility 

00:04:02.770 --> 00:04:05.410
 several color properties to each other 

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:06.910
 to hang 

00:04:05.410 --> 00:04:08.350
 then you just separate the word 

00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:09.910
 I also have that with each other 

00:04:08.350 --> 00:04:11.320
 however in other videos as well 

00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:13.239
 already shown you can just do it 

00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:14.680
 look into the sewer pipes but otherwise 

00:04:13.239 --> 00:04:16.090
 I hope you enjoyed it and 

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:17.350
 Above all , you have managed to continue 

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:19.810
 the splash lyrics now definitely 

00:04:17.350 --> 00:04:22.480
 quite easily edit under your 

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:23.830
 wonderful news house that 

00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:25.000
 was but left of this video 

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:27.100
 on the right you can still find one 

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:29.140
 tutorial and how do you minecraft 

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:32.050
 enchantment table could translate as well 

00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:33.760
 very practical, however, can be 

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:34.750
 no conclusions about the enchantment 

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:36.370
 shut down 

00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:38.050
 im like to look over there or you 

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:40.750
