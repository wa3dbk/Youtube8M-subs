00:00:03.589 --> 00:00:07.560
 this time a tour that we take to 

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:10.170
 national level where we are visiting 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:14.730
 some schools dictating trainings 

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:17.430
 or clubs at the departmental level 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:19.289
 national and is also an American already 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:21.660
 that the previous weekend we were 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:24.689
 in Quito Ecuador - judging and training 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:26.670
 the cheerleader now divides into two already 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:30.300
 that we are legally constituted as 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:31.969
 sport where we hope and aspire to 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:34.380
 collaboration of the centers 

00:00:31.969 --> 00:00:37.290
 departmental and government in 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:39.540
 As support for this discipline because 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:41.460
 before they said that for not being a sport 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:43.500
 we did not have the support but now what 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:46.079
 we achieved and we are demonstrating that it is a 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:48.360
 social phenomenon that grow day by day in 

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:50.550
 everyone and if that's a change 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:53.280
 interesting since there was a stigma of 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:55.829
 that this sport was only for women and 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:57.690
 is the real story is this the cheerleading 

00:00:55.829 --> 00:01:00.270
 was created by men in the 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:02.250
 university in minnesota 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:04.170
 by a person named Tony Campbell 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:05.730
 that got up in a game and started to 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:07.890
 encourage the public and from there began the 

00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:09.570
 bars but women started in the 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:10.950
 Cheerleading after the Second War 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:13.350
 world where all men are 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:16.560
 they went and the women took over 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:18.180
 this sport and now with everything that 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:21.090
 has happened and all the changes between the 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:23.220
 gymnastics the rhythm and now it 's a level 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:24.540
 totally different where the 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:27.960
 strength of man and beauty of the 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:29.940
 woman is a sport that lives here very 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:32.070
 well you feel what happens is that 

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:34.619
 they still manage it as it is handled 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:37.020
 before it is more magazine than competitive 

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:38.850
 but now with the new ones 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:40.649
 trainings that we are giving in 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:42.090
 As for regulation , they are already 

00:01:40.649 --> 00:01:44.430
 focusing more on what we should do 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:46.200
 so here is an excellent job and 

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:49.110
 we have to show it to the rest of the world 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:51.420
 the road can not make an opportunity 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:53.750
 very good is a way to come and 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:56.230
 contribute our knowledge 

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:59.300
 people is something that makes us happy 

00:01:56.230 --> 00:02:02.260
 first of all attitude attitude 

00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:02.260
 discipline 

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:08.729
 of all and many values in 

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:11.460
 responsibility respect work in 

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:15.900
 team that practices on the chip that is 

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:18.850
 a nice and cool way to wear a 

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:21.580
 Healthy healthy life 

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:23.920
 it's a sport we love in our passion and 

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:26.730
 we dedicate practically all our 

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:29.350
 Training and doing time 

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:30.820
 skills training and dictating 

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:32.770
 clinics the trainings what 

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:35.230
 we do is a general diagnosis of 

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:37.330
 all of all athletes starting 

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:38.980
 of that we begin to look what valences 

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:41.230
 we must we must improve 

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:42.910
 correct and so we start making some 

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:46.180
 acrobatic classes in the classes of 

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:48.190
 do some jumps the dance classes 

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:50.530
 of gymnastics now we try to cover 

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:52.690
 everything a little according to what 

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:56.110
 need the athletes already very 

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:58.480
 some people thought it was still a 

00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:59.950
 something artistic and cultural now that 

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:01.950
 about a year ago we went 

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:03.640
 declared sports because we were like 

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:05.860
 recognized as a level sport 

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:07.330
 national and international then and 

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:09.610
 people are becoming more aware that 

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:10.990
 is a sport that is very complete and that 

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:13.390

00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:15.250
 world is a very complete sport very 

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:17.410
 nice and do not worry should not be 

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:19.540

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:20.710
 they must be neither have the super flexibility 

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:22.120
 everything is learned as we go 

00:03:20.710 --> 00:03:24.519
