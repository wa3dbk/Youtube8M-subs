00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:11.139
 This I grew points in what and today I 

00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:14.289
 tell you exactly how 

00:00:11.139 --> 00:00:15.039
 stress nervous tension worsen your 

00:00:14.289 --> 00:00:17.500
 vision 

00:00:15.039 --> 00:00:20.320
 cause the progression of myopia and 

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:23.230
 other eye diseases word stress itself 

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:25.600
 in English this pressure is pressure load 

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:28.150
 stress pressure and this word is very 

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:30.580
 well reflects what happens in 

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:32.460
 your eyes with nervous tension when 

00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:35.500
 nervous tension eyes tense 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:38.350
 rather tense one way or another 

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:41.170
 even all the muscles of the eyes it is noticeable even 

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:44.019
 externally for example under stress i'm like under 

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:46.300
 any pain the pupil expands only from 

00:00:44.019 --> 00:00:48.730
 it may get worse 

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:51.550
 especially short-sighted because without them 

00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:54.219
 stress has to squint and by the way u 

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:56.920
 myopic pupils are always wider than that 

00:00:54.219 --> 00:00:58.839
 people with normal refraction expands 

00:00:56.920 --> 00:01:01.659
 not only the pupil voltage changes 

00:00:58.839 --> 00:01:04.299
 other eye muscles such as ciliary 

00:01:01.659 --> 00:01:06.400
 muscles when the ciliary muscle is tensed 

00:01:04.299 --> 00:01:09.250
 which directly affects 

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:12.310
 the accommodation of the lens becomes more 

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:15.130
 the focal length is convex 

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:17.980
 the image moves away from the retina a 

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:20.140
 appears on the retina more blurred 

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:22.780
 blurry image visible 

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:25.420
 getting worse are straining and others 

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:28.330
 muscle groups for example when tense 

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:30.220
 upper and lower obliques the eye 

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:32.500
 lengthens in the front rear direction 

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:34.090
 because it keeps him from behind 

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:37.030
 optic nerve clear image 

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:39.100
 located inside the eye and on the retina 

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:40.090
 vague blurry remains 

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:42.850
 picture 

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:44.920
 if strained muscles of the eye 

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:47.500
 four straight muscles that are normal 

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:50.920
 turn it left right up down 

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:54.010
 the eye is flattened it is pressed by these 

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:56.290
 muscles of the posterior wall of the orbit focal 

00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:59.110
 the distance moves back behind the retina 

00:01:56.290 --> 00:02:01.720
 where it is nothing to see and on the retina 

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:04.300
 again more blurry 

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:06.550
 not clear image is strained and 

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:09.369
 other muscle groups and for example muscles 

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:12.010
 vessels but this is a completely separate topic 

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:15.150
 and so with their stress the eye muscles 

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:17.129
 tense up see worse 

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:19.470
 because they change focal 

00:02:17.129 --> 00:02:21.629
 distance and the eye itself is sometimes very 

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:24.269
 severely deformed especially when 

00:02:21.629 --> 00:02:26.310
 straining eye muscles not so beautiful 

00:02:24.269 --> 00:02:28.439
 as i showed on these pictures a 

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:30.840
 tense one or another muscle group 

00:02:28.439 --> 00:02:33.090
 then the eye is deformed unevenly and 

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:35.670
 let's say so let's say this or that 

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:38.220
 hand then develops astigmatism about 

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:40.319
 the one that is most stressful 

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:42.239
 for our eyes I will tell you in 

00:02:40.319 --> 00:02:45.420
 next time and now you can 

00:02:42.239 --> 00:02:47.940
 get a free vision tuning book 

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:50.209
 which describes my methodology which 

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:54.109
 can help you improve your vision 

00:02:50.209 --> 00:02:54.109
 almost any problem
