00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:26.210 
here we got the motor so this is the

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:30.789 
here we got the motor so this is the
Taiwanese<00:01:27.210> made<00:01:27.740> BMW<00:01:28.740> turned<00:01:29.189> husky<00:01:30.060> motor

injection<00:01:35.100> seems<00:01:35.700> to<00:01:35.850> do<00:01:35.969> good<00:01:36.299> it's<00:01:36.600> not<00:01:37.469> a

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
injection seems to do good it's not a

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:40.940 
injection seems to do good it's not a
real<00:01:38.429> powerhouse<00:01:39.119> kind<00:01:39.749> of<00:01:39.869> motor<00:01:40.049> it<00:01:40.530> does

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
real powerhouse kind of motor it does

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:43.489 
real powerhouse kind of motor it does
have<00:01:41.249> some<00:01:41.460> good<00:01:41.490> torque<00:01:41.999> but<00:01:42.390> it<00:01:43.140> doesn't

00:01:43.489 --> 00:01:43.499 
have some good torque but it doesn't

00:01:43.499 --> 00:01:46.609 
have some good torque but it doesn't
really<00:01:43.890> care<00:01:44.340> to<00:01:44.490> rev<00:01:44.700> very<00:01:44.999> much<00:01:45.240> is<00:01:45.619> to

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:46.619 
really care to rev very much is to

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:49.010 
really care to rev very much is to
shortcomings<00:01:47.219> are<00:01:47.429> that<00:01:48.179> it<00:01:48.329> does<00:01:48.359> vibrate

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
shortcomings are that it does vibrate

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:51.230 
shortcomings are that it does vibrate
and<00:01:49.200> it's<00:01:49.590> got<00:01:49.799> a<00:01:49.829> really<00:01:50.189> close<00:01:50.789> ratio

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240 
and it's got a really close ratio

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:54.169 
and it's got a really close ratio
transmission<00:01:51.659> in<00:01:52.139> there<00:01:52.319> so<00:01:52.710> as<00:01:52.950> we<00:01:53.789> put<00:01:54.030> on

00:01:54.169 --> 00:01:54.179 
transmission in there so as we put on

00:01:54.179 --> 00:01:56.059 
transmission in there so as we put on
more<00:01:54.420> miles<00:01:54.689> the<00:01:55.020> motor<00:01:55.289> definitely<00:01:55.859> gets

00:01:56.059 --> 00:01:56.069 
more miles the motor definitely gets

00:01:56.069 --> 00:02:00.289 
more miles the motor definitely gets
smoother<00:01:56.819> and<00:01:56.999> more<00:01:57.659> powerful<00:01:58.969> but<00:01:59.969> II<00:02:00.030> meant

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:00.299 
smoother and more powerful but II meant

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:02.029 
smoother and more powerful but II meant
that<00:02:00.509> it's<00:02:00.719> it's<00:02:01.200> it's<00:02:01.530> nothing<00:02:01.920> really

00:02:02.029 --> 00:02:02.039 
that it's it's it's nothing really

00:02:02.039 --> 00:02:04.340 
that it's it's it's nothing really
groundbreaking<00:02:02.520> there<00:02:02.999> real<00:02:03.810> nice<00:02:03.990> side

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:04.350 
groundbreaking there real nice side

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:08.180 
groundbreaking there real nice side

the construction style on the cue and

00:03:44.329 --> 00:03:46.970 
the construction style on the cue and
it's<00:03:45.329> frankly<00:03:46.230> it's<00:03:46.379> quite<00:03:46.560> a<00:03:46.590> bit<00:03:46.769> less

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:46.980

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:48.709 
it's frankly it's quite a bit less
sophisticated<00:03:47.310> than<00:03:47.819> it<00:03:48.000> used<00:03:48.150> to<00:03:48.239> be<00:03:48.450> and

00:03:48.709 --> 00:03:48.719 
sophisticated than it used to be and

00:03:48.719 --> 00:03:51.920 
sophisticated than it used to be and

cover<00:04:02.700> hanging<00:04:03.090> out<00:04:03.209> over<00:04:03.239> here<00:04:03.569> this<00:04:04.079> thing

00:04:04.459 --> 00:04:04.469 
cover hanging out over here this thing

00:04:04.469 --> 00:04:06.649 
cover hanging out over here this thing
does<00:04:04.859> stick<00:04:05.430> out<00:04:05.640> a<00:04:05.670> bit<00:04:06.000> you<00:04:06.090> can<00:04:06.120> see<00:04:06.450> how

00:04:06.649 --> 00:04:06.659 
does stick out a bit you can see how

00:04:06.659 --> 00:04:08.860 
does stick out a bit you can see how
hard<00:04:06.930> my<00:04:07.170> boots<00:04:07.469> been<00:04:07.739> wearing<00:04:08.129> against<00:04:08.579> it

everybody's<00:06:04.310> building<00:06:04.520> a<00:06:04.640> handguard<00:06:05.030> shorter

00:06:05.530 --> 00:06:05.540 
everybody's building a handguard shorter

00:06:05.540 --> 00:06:08.080 
everybody's building a handguard shorter
these<00:06:05.660> days<00:06:05.990> and<00:06:06.340> so<00:06:07.340> they<00:06:07.490> don't<00:06:07.730> reach<00:06:08.060> the

00:06:08.080 --> 00:06:08.090 
these days and so they don't reach the

00:06:08.090 --> 00:06:10.000 
these days and so they don't reach the
end<00:06:08.480> of<00:06:08.630> the<00:06:08.690> bars<00:06:08.930> and<00:06:09.320> they're<00:06:09.440> in<00:06:09.590> a<00:06:09.650> fixed

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:10.010 
end of the bars and they're in a fixed

00:06:10.010 --> 00:06:12.010 
end of the bars and they're in a fixed
positions<00:06:10.580> it's<00:06:10.820> just<00:06:11.060> like<00:06:11.210> the<00:06:11.330> KTM<00:06:11.750> ones

00:06:12.010 --> 00:06:12.020 
positions it's just like the KTM ones

00:06:12.020 --> 00:06:14.950 
positions it's just like the KTM ones
but<00:06:12.950> they're<00:06:13.340> really<00:06:13.550> too<00:06:13.970> short<00:06:14.390> for<00:06:14.480> me<00:06:14.810> to

00:06:14.950 --> 00:06:14.960 
but they're really too short for me to

00:06:14.960 --> 00:06:17.590 
but they're really too short for me to
be<00:06:15.080> practical<00:06:15.740> for<00:06:15.790> really<00:06:16.790> serious<00:06:17.300> off-road

00:06:17.590 --> 00:06:17.600 
be practical for really serious off-road
