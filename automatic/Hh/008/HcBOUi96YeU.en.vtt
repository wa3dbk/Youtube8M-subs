00:00:03.310 --> 00:00:07.970
 We will probably in the future 

00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:10.010
 systems automatically return that gas 

00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:12.380
 take or operate the brake when the one 

00:00:10.010 --> 00:00:13.849
 the car is too close to the other 

00:00:12.380 --> 00:00:15.980
 those systems themselves have been going for years 

00:00:13.849 --> 00:00:17.480
 tested but also a bit older 

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:18.589
 system to steer the case in the right direction 

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:19.970
 lead 

00:00:18.589 --> 00:00:21.409
 you lay rails and later a train 

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:22.640
 drive over and 

00:00:21.409 --> 00:00:25.609
 everyone has to drive such a train 

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:27.399
 can little farther they sometimes 

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:29.630
 well you think not everyone can do it 

00:00:27.399 --> 00:00:32.239
 you will have to follow a course yet 

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:35.030
 and their eggs it certainly not what is there 

00:00:32.239 --> 00:00:36.740
 then so difficult and what would be difficult 

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:38.690
 to be is your way fame and 

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:40.730
 first one will know the material 

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:42.770
 you must know on an exam you must 

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:46.460
 can tell where certain danger 

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:48.560
 points are true so consider those 

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:50.690
 you have to be able to create many problems 

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:53.390
 can tell with numbers 

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:54.770
 how long do you do this i do this now 25 

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:56.420
 year 

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:58.370
 and all the while alone on the goat and all 

00:00:56.420 --> 00:01:00.590
 that time only the plates yes what 

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:02.180
 makes you so pale in traffic because there 

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:04.640
 we are few times when it is you 

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:06.770
 traffic cross of course yes that is 

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:08.420
 indeed it is minimal but yes you 

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:09.319
 makes a lot of near-accidents 

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:11.539
 me 

00:01:09.319 --> 00:01:12.979
 people who think they are still easy 

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:14.899
 before that time can also go 

00:01:12.979 --> 00:01:16.850
 the trees close so between the trees 

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:18.979
 drive on because you can see that too 

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:21.020
 happen that you can see it coming 

00:01:18.979 --> 00:01:23.960
 that people start to travel by train 

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:25.490
 on a parallel road for example 

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:28.069
 And where you know that one has gone 

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:29.810
 comes quickly and quickly 

00:01:28.069 --> 00:01:32.030
 go what should i imagine where the 

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:34.700
 braking distance of a train its bucket of a 

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:37.299
 train is running at full speed 

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:37.299
 the 800 meters 

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:41.240
 can you look as far ahead as 

00:01:39.049 --> 00:01:43.939
 on some points the driver does 

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:45.619
 yes i once have a car that is quiet 

00:01:43.939 --> 00:01:46.969
 stood up and got on 

00:01:45.619 --> 00:01:49.700
 and I was able to do that on time 

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:51.469
 sometimes stop unhappy with it 

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:52.550
 users not a nickname to succeed either 

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:54.950
 unfortunate 

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:56.210
 with fatal outcome what happens then 

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:57.890
 also discovered this way 

00:01:56.210 --> 00:02:00.290
 yes then it is still a movie through you 

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:01.640
 away from why why did I have to 

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:02.900
 to happen 

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:06.110
 it is it is always only one 

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:09.530
 snapshot and that yes the elysis 

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:10.520
 can have huge consequences what is your 

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:12.220
 for example happen 

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:15.400
 well i have so 

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:17.830
 so the self never been and yes that was possible 

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:21.160
 I don't change anything and you come 

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:23.140
 collide with 130 and it was memory 

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:25.150
 it is very short the story short 

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:27.610
 story what you see something of that 

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:29.410
 happen to you the moment you arrive 

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:31.940
 it you expand the doubt becomes light 

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:33.590
 hair or what splitter 

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:36.470
 that is always a shock reaction 

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:37.970
 of course what happens 

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:39.920
 but you can do nothing to it 

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:41.600
 change it happens 

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:43.340
 So you can not do anything about it yourself 

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:47.150
 you do little you can whistle you can 

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:48.560
 start braking and that is usually too late 

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:50.300
 we have had an accident than cut 

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:51.470
 I do not know how long silent 

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:53.720
 then you have to passed on again 

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:55.580
 moment then you go home in the evening 

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:57.740
 someone who cares about you 

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:59.750
 well as a fatal accident or one 

00:02:57.740 --> 00:03:02.990
 near accident then you will be taken care of 

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:04.550
 by your group leader and most of the time it is you 

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:07.670
 own group if you are far from you 

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:09.920
 location is that another and that 

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:11.960
 will try to turn on your stories 

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:13.070
 should be the first to receive attention 

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:15.230
 actual 

00:03:13.070 --> 00:03:18.020
 yes you need attention then again 

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:20.030
 time alone you can again 

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:22.700
 then you will have to be able to withstand the weather 

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:24.220
 what is your job so that it is 

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:27.880
 rock hard eh 

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:30.100
 it is hard without 

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:33.270
 so of course not so wide you don't have any 

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:33.270
 absolutely not
