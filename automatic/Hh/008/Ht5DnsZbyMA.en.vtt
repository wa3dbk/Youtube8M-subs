00:00:09.050 --> 00:00:13.130
 hello friends I hope you are very 

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:14.750
 well I want to thank you for all 

00:00:13.130 --> 00:00:16.369
 the good comments that they leave me in 

00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:18.590
 all the videos in this series for 

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:20.360
 learn to play guitar I can see that 

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:22.640
 they are really helping them so that 

00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:24.050
 encouraged to move forward and I know that with 

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:26.029
 the practice will become great 

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:28.130
 guitarists and well this is the 

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:29.840
 seventh video of this series if you have not 

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:32.060
 come the previous six here in my 

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:33.410
 I'll leave them for you so that any 

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:35.120
 video that you want to check or if you want 

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:37.910
 check all simply because dale click 

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:39.829
 and they will send you the videos on this occasion 

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:41.780
 let's learn about tabs 

00:00:39.829 --> 00:00:44.269
 now that are the hard boards and for 

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:45.530
 what hard tables are good for us 

00:00:44.269 --> 00:00:48.590
 a method that guitarists 

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:52.010
 we use to communicate the music of 

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:53.809
 written form music is a language and 

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:55.640
 like all the language as well as 

00:00:53.809 --> 00:00:57.589
 you can communicate orally or with 

00:00:55.640 --> 00:01:01.280
 sounds because you can also communicate 

00:00:57.589 --> 00:01:03.230
 written mind so for example if I 

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:06.230
 I want to teach you a written song 

00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:08.360
 I can do it through a 

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:11.330
 table or if I want to learn a 

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:13.910
 equal song through a tabla tura 

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:15.260
 I can learn a song so 

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:15.890
 We can both conclude that it is very 

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:19.310
 important 

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:21.440
 Every guitarist learns to write and 

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:23.870
 aller tablatures and the truth that this is 

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:24.979
 something very simple look here we can see 

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:28.150
 the tabla tura 

00:01:24.979 --> 00:01:30.310
 here we have this diagram 

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:34.210
 and the lines that we see 

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:37.270
 horizontally those lines represent 

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:40.420
 the strings of the guitar for example 

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:42.870
 that would be the first string beginning 

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:42.870
 with this one 

00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:46.700
 second string 

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:50.640
 third rope 

00:01:51.409 --> 00:01:54.970
 fourth rope 

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:57.990
 i 

00:01:54.970 --> 00:01:57.990
 fifth string 

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:01.280
 and sixth string 

00:02:03.409 --> 00:02:08.830
 and the numbers 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:10.220
 represent the fret where we have to 

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:12.410
 touch 

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:15.730
 and they leave from left to right as well as 

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:18.920
 we read Spanish for example 

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:22.450
 so if we already know that the 

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:25.130
 lines represent the strings and 

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:29.180
 numbers that we see in the lines the 

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:32.140
 frets then we can understand this very 

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:34.460
 easily for example let's say that in the 

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:38.230
 sixth string 

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:41.750
 we have a number three and a number five 

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:46.130
 this means that we are going to play on 

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:48.110
 that string on fret 3 and on 5 like that 

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:50.530
 of simple 

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:53.340
 3 

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:53.340
 and 5 

00:02:54.900 --> 00:03:00.120
 and practically those are the tables 

00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:03.319
 The line represents the lines 

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:05.579
 horizontal the strings and the antics 

00:03:03.319 --> 00:03:07.860
 they simply represent the fret of one 

00:03:05.579 --> 00:03:10.530
 have to touch here we have another 

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:13.920
 example about the third string we have 

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:15.329
 a 2 and a 4 means that on the 

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:18.390
 third string we are going to play in the 

00:03:15.329 --> 00:03:21.600
 fret 2 and on the number 4 fret so 

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:24.530
 simple look 2 

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:24.530
 and 4 

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:30.410
 another example on the first string 

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:32.769
 we have a zero and a number two zero 

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:36.590
 means that the string is played to the air 

00:03:32.769 --> 00:03:38.740
 then it would be like that zero and then we 

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:41.280
 says our number two 

00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:41.280
 d 

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:46.950
 you see how simple it is now let's 

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:49.379
 implement this and I'm going to 

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:51.330
 teach the little bit of a song that 

00:03:49.379 --> 00:03:53.069
 you imagine I know you are the 

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:56.629
 introduction or a bit of the 

00:03:53.069 --> 00:03:56.629
 introduction of the pink panther 'look 

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:08.810
 and 

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:15.570
 you see now I can teach you a 

00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:17.640
 song and you can understand it to 

00:04:15.570 --> 00:04:19.799
 through tablatures look let's see 

00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:21.930
 how we would learn it then in the 

00:04:19.799 --> 00:04:24.810
 table we can see that on the rope 

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:27.900
 number 6 is indicating that there is 

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:29.550
 play twice on the air 

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:32.600
 then he tells us to touch on the 

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:32.600
 fret 1 and in 2 

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:36.870
 already saw it would look similar 

00:04:39.969 --> 00:04:45.399
 now those diagonal lines that look like that 

00:04:42.809 --> 00:04:47.199
 represent or indicate the times that 

00:04:45.399 --> 00:04:49.209
 will repeat for example if this is 

00:04:47.199 --> 00:04:52.959
 repeat once I would simply put 

00:04:49.209 --> 00:04:54.519
 the two horizontal diagonal lines if what 

00:04:52.959 --> 00:04:56.709
 he wants to repeat twice because he puts those 

00:04:54.519 --> 00:04:58.899
 indicated lines or you want to indicate that 

00:04:56.709 --> 00:05:01.059
 is going to repeat three times that same 

00:04:58.899 --> 00:05:03.939
 sentence so as not to write it again 

00:05:01.059 --> 00:05:06.759
 you simply put three lines indicating 

00:05:03.939 --> 00:05:08.960
 that this is going to be played three times 

00:05:06.759 --> 00:05:10.569
 would like thousand 

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:14.789
 to 

00:05:10.569 --> 00:05:14.789
 is once the second time 

00:05:15.270 --> 00:05:18.380
 it would come the third time 

00:05:18.470 --> 00:05:24.320
 you saw and then we have a change 

00:05:21.380 --> 00:05:25.940
 for example what follows in the fifth 

00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:28.110
 rope is telling us that we have in 

00:05:25.940 --> 00:05:31.070
 the fret 1 

00:05:28.110 --> 00:05:31.070
 Leonel 2 

00:05:32.550 --> 00:05:38.870
 so it was like that 

00:05:35.480 --> 00:05:42.009
 and then up on the sixth string it 

00:05:38.870 --> 00:05:45.539
 they touch the same 1 and 2 

00:05:42.009 --> 00:05:45.539
 then this would be similar 

00:05:47.610 --> 00:05:54.550
 and now the next is in the fifth 

00:05:51.250 --> 00:05:57.800
 rope is telling us to play on 

00:05:54.550 --> 00:06:00.819
 new on fret 1 and then on 2 

00:05:57.800 --> 00:06:00.819
 we would stay like this 

00:06:03.580 --> 00:06:09.070
 and then almost to finish is done 

00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:09.070
 the next 

00:06:11.260 --> 00:06:16.870
 then this is done by touching the 

00:06:13.690 --> 00:06:20.710
 fourth string second fret and then the 

00:06:16.870 --> 00:06:23.980
 first then we climb a rope or 

00:06:20.710 --> 00:06:26.670
 in the fifth and we played the same second 

00:06:23.980 --> 00:06:26.670
 and first 

00:06:26.720 --> 00:06:35.980
 and we go down again to the fourth string and 

00:06:31.010 --> 00:06:35.980
 we play second and first it would be like that 

00:06:36.020 --> 00:06:38.710
 ah 

00:06:39.370 --> 00:06:42.370
 have 

00:06:43.249 --> 00:06:46.879
 see how simple this is going to give everything 

00:06:45.409 --> 00:06:49.899
 a quick review of this song and 

00:06:46.879 --> 00:06:49.899
 it would be like this finally 

00:06:56.380 --> 00:06:58.770
 ah 

00:07:00.280 --> 00:07:03.280
 Y 

00:07:03.930 --> 00:07:07.650
 Now this thing that I just taught you is 

00:07:05.759 --> 00:07:09.360
 as the basics of hard boards and 

00:07:07.650 --> 00:07:11.550
 that there are other symbols that also 

00:07:09.360 --> 00:07:14.580
 they are used to represent different 

00:07:11.550 --> 00:07:16.110
 techniques but do not worry about that 

00:07:14.580 --> 00:07:17.789
 we're going to learn little from that 

00:07:16.110 --> 00:07:19.979
 we are in a process where 

00:07:17.789 --> 00:07:20.850
 we start from scratch and little by little 

00:07:19.979 --> 00:07:23.310
 let's go forward 

00:07:20.850 --> 00:07:25.020
 ok so do not worry now that if 

00:07:23.310 --> 00:07:26.789
 they want to have as an idea of ​​what 

00:07:25.020 --> 00:07:28.830
 I tell them that it was hard for me to leave them a 

00:07:26.789 --> 00:07:31.050
 video that I made some time ago where he spoke 

00:07:28.830 --> 00:07:32.639
 about that do not forget to give like 

00:07:31.050 --> 00:07:34.350
 this video is one of the best ways 

00:07:32.639 --> 00:07:35.940
 where you can thank me in the same way 

00:07:34.350 --> 00:07:38.160
 comments tell me what you thought 

00:07:35.940 --> 00:07:40.229
 this video that is appearing to you 

00:07:38.160 --> 00:07:42.030
 series in general and equal if they have 

00:07:40.229 --> 00:07:43.289
 questions if you have questions leave them there 

00:07:42.030 --> 00:07:45.750
 in the comments and I will do everything 

00:07:43.289 --> 00:07:47.370
 possible to answer them now that I was 

00:07:45.750 --> 00:07:49.020
 they want to thank me even more and 

00:07:47.370 --> 00:07:50.430
 want to say you know that aaron thank you 

00:07:49.020 --> 00:07:52.650
 for the videos they really are 

00:07:50.430 --> 00:07:54.900
 helping then share this 

00:07:52.650 --> 00:07:56.940
 video and all the videos in the series with 

00:07:54.900 --> 00:07:58.979
 all your friends believe me that more 

00:07:56.940 --> 00:08:00.330
 How grateful and with great pleasure 

00:07:58.979 --> 00:08:02.639
 I will continue making these videos for 

00:08:00.330 --> 00:08:04.530
 you here I leave you my networks 

00:08:02.639 --> 00:08:06.810
 social if interested just in 

00:08:04.530 --> 00:08:08.610
 they want to check and well, I say goodbye 

00:08:06.810 --> 00:08:10.620
 do not forget to practice do not forget 

00:08:08.610 --> 00:08:13.760
 dedicate time that instrument 

00:08:10.620 --> 00:08:13.760
 in the next video
