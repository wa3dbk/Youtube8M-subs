00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:04.480
It's the first time for
Nga Manu Waiata

00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:08.520
to compete at Te Matatini 2013.

00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:12.240
Raiha Johns got the scoop
on their bracket

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:15.920
at their fundraising event
in South Yarra.

00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:26.080
This is the fundraising event
for Nga Manu Waiata.

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:31.080
They're raising money to perform
at Te Matatini 2013.

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:47.400
Even though the group
is from Melbourne,

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:51.440
they're not the renowned group,
Poipiripi.

00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:04.440
They are competing in Pool C.

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:09.680
They say their style
is explained in their name.

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:19.400
Their tutor has a warning
for all the other Matatini groups.

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:21.200
Be careful of our poi.

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:23.800
It's pretty amazing!

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:27.880
Kapa haka strengthens
the connection to home

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:31.120
for these Maori who live far away.

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:38.160
Their biggest warning is this.

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:55.560
Nga Manu Waiata will perform
on the 23rd of February.

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:04.920
