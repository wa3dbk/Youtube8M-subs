00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:24.240 
there my kids and I are not the best
gardeners<00:02:22.569> so<00:02:22.989> we<00:02:23.200> help<00:02:23.470> grow<00:02:23.680> things<00:02:23.980> in<00:02:24.160> our

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:24.250 
gardeners so we help grow things in our

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:26.400 
gardeners so we help grow things in our
own<00:02:24.430> yard<00:02:24.730> but<00:02:25.629> I<00:02:25.660> think<00:02:25.900> it's<00:02:25.989> important<00:02:26.379> for

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:26.410 
own yard but I think it's important for

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:28.020 
own yard but I think it's important for
them<00:02:26.560> to<00:02:26.620> know<00:02:26.770> where<00:02:27.160> food<00:02:27.400> comes<00:02:27.430> from<00:02:27.940> and

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:28.030 
them to know where food comes from and

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:30.210 
them to know where food comes from and
what<00:02:28.270> it<00:02:28.360> looks<00:02:28.599> like<00:02:28.810> before<00:02:29.260> it's<00:02:29.379> processed

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:30.220 
what it looks like before it's processed

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:31.979 
what it looks like before it's processed
so<00:02:30.760> when<00:02:30.910> we<00:02:31.000> go<00:02:31.090> to<00:02:31.120> the<00:02:31.270> farmers<00:02:31.599> market<00:02:31.629> and

00:02:31.989 --> 00:02:33.720
