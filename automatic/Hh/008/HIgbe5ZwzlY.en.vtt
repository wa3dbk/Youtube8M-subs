00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:56.460
 of skills spots like the swat spots 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:57.780
 there was something for everyone if the skate 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:59.489
 I want to build a team then I build something with 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:01.140
 pws learned the brain with frost on 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:03.660
 best you write yes in the comments 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:05.159
 What should I build for god then 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:06.479
 if you have preference if you 

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:08.790
 really scanner since just write 

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:10.470
 want to see in the comments of yens 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:11.909
 so i have all the players at foot 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:13.470
 already inserted because it should not be 

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:16.530
 be long video i want you 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:18.270
 just an overton of creative scott 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:20.970
 Imagine in the first video and you see 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:22.830
 her in a 4 3 3 to explain myself 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:24.840
 I thought that the 433 would be very op 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:28.110
 will be in riga and that is not it 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:29.540
 because the flanks are right 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:31.710
 a flank information 

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:32.880
 I mean in fifa is very important 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:34.380
 to have wings to escape 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:36.180
 can and have a great deal shot 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:37.979
 that will be important to the 415 it has to 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:41.670
 not so many flanks be there and 

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:44.009
 you also do not have to walk the good foot anymore 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:46.200
 So you have half of it on your side 

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:47.820
 fifa 14 not so good because he does not 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:50.700
 can flank or the maria and here 

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:52.979
 Do you have this year right after 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:54.390
 can escape properly schott has the 

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:54.780
 can really make a lot of goals 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:57.720
 becomes 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:59.940
 the Upper and user adrian a ramos 

00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:01.500
 striker who will be ready and was 

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:02.909
 mirjam if it ever ne flank in 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:04.530
 bring and he is of course one 

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:07.110
 Obersberg player, he is very clear 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:09.209
 then we see chorin on paper 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:11.340
 a very offensive position because of 

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:13.410
 saint georg reitz has and very good 

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:15.180
 Physicists will have 85 in addition 

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:16.950
 he gets the frosta skills will be so 

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:17.310
 a very good playmaker for you 

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:19.980
 People 

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:22.530
 then I still have meters on the right 

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:25.020
 position in my opinion a very 

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:27.660
 important player in fifa 15 because he 

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:29.400
 Six musicians have good defensive works 

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:31.260
 will have like the hai and pretty much 

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:33.030
 fast it is a real defensive 

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:34.650
 tomorrow on the other side to winners 

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:36.930
 a player who mirrors you 

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:38.459
 therefore, it will help already with medea 

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:40.500
 and choir so a bit more defensive 

00:02:38.459 --> 00:02:42.120
 you still have bena the one too 

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:43.950
 But defending a little bit has more 

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:45.450
 for the passes and for the long shot 

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:46.739
 maybe responsible and the 

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:48.930
 Defense is very, very, very much 

00:02:46.739 --> 00:02:51.989
 will overboard congo or just like usual 

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:53.910
 what has a lot of pace good defensive 

00:02:51.989 --> 00:02:55.769
 works probably you still have 

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:58.170
 coentrao on the other side of the yes 

00:02:55.769 --> 00:02:59.760
 vw has been responsible for the offensive 

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:01.470
 he is not so fast then you need 

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:02.820
 fast defenseman and in the 

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:04.500
 Home defense has de miranda and 

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:06.209
 that are pretty fast and fit 

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:07.769
 have a good deal to defend and that 

00:03:06.209 --> 00:03:09.690
 You will really need speed 

00:03:07.769 --> 00:03:11.100
 and defending precious is not 

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:13.470
 the more important all hopefully in 

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:15.570
 fifa 1500 caesar I am with myself completely 

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:17.730
 it is certainly true that he is 

00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:19.950
 be very balanced with his too 

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:22.110
 will be a goalkeeper and what 

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:23.970
 really good at this corps today it is 

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:25.829
 a budget sport for you there is no 

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:27.600
 player who will be over circle 

00:03:25.829 --> 00:03:29.370
 Obermann has gotten worse and it 

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:31.829
 on the wing changed the costs 

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:32.340
 maximum 5000 in the beginning I would times 

00:03:31.829 --> 00:03:34.560
 estimate 

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:36.600
 miranda is the highest rated but the 

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:38.489
 will also be through the good others 

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:40.320
 defender in the bbva relative 

00:03:38.489 --> 00:03:42.570
 this team could be cheap 

00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:44.370
 so if you are 15 to 20 km the 

00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:45.930
 first week decides loosely 

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:48.069
 build a starter team if you really are 

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:49.569
 want to have a creative team 

00:03:48.069 --> 00:03:51.430
 so people then i hope it has you 

00:03:49.569 --> 00:03:52.569
 like I said if you forget 

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:53.109
 not to subscribe that's really that 

00:03:52.569 --> 00:03:54.939
 leading 

00:03:53.109 --> 00:03:57.040
 then stay tuned here and you can 

00:03:54.939 --> 00:03:59.200
 really good short for your ultimate 

00:03:57.040 --> 00:04:00.459
 watch the team and maybe the video 

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:01.719
 I would be very happy too 

00:04:00.459 --> 00:04:03.879
 to write unforgettable comments 

00:04:01.719 --> 00:04:06.219
 which you want to see next 

00:04:03.879 --> 00:04:07.659
 that firstly pc videos i hope so 

00:04:06.219 --> 00:04:11.370
