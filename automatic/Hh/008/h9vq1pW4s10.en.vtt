00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:04.200 
lot of occasions but i would still quite

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:05.780 
lot of occasions but i would still quite
quite<00:02:04.409> a<00:02:04.439> few<00:02:04.649> chances<00:02:04.890> in<00:02:05.219> the<00:02:05.340> first<00:02:05.490> half

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:50.340 
was way too late and to be fair my

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:52.280 
was way too late and to be fair my
opponent<00:03:50.790> was<00:03:50.850> quite<00:03:51.090> good<00:03:51.120> and<00:03:51.540> his<00:03:51.900> key<00:03:52.110> but

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:52.290 
opponent was quite good and his key but

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:54.320 
opponent was quite good and his key but
you<00:03:52.440> saved<00:03:52.739> a<00:03:52.890> lot<00:03:53.010> of<00:03:53.070> stuff<00:03:53.340> it<00:03:53.550> was<00:03:53.700> a<00:03:53.730> very

00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:54.330 
you saved a lot of stuff it was a very

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:56.810 
you saved a lot of stuff it was a very
even<00:03:54.840> game<00:03:55.019> as<00:03:55.170> well<00:03:55.290> so<00:03:55.530> i<00:03:55.560> do<00:03:55.680> think<00:03:55.890> it

00:03:56.810 --> 00:03:56.820 
even game as well so i do think it

00:03:56.820 --> 00:03:58.759 
even game as well so i do think it
deserved<00:03:57.300> to<00:03:57.480> be<00:03:57.510> a<00:03:57.630> drawer<00:03:57.930> but<00:03:58.140> of<00:03:58.290> course<00:03:58.530> it

00:03:58.759 --> 00:03:58.769 
deserved to be a drawer but of course it

00:03:58.769 --> 00:04:00.650 
deserved to be a drawer but of course it
was<00:03:58.890> very<00:03:59.310> disappointing<00:03:59.489> not<00:04:00.150> getting<00:04:00.570> the

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:00.660 
was very disappointing not getting the

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:02.270 
was very disappointing not getting the
win<00:04:00.810> because<00:04:01.019> i<00:04:01.200> really<00:04:01.709> wanted<00:04:01.739> to<00:04:02.070> promote

00:04:02.270 --> 00:04:02.280 
win because i really wanted to promote

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:04.759 
win because i really wanted to promote
instead<00:04:02.820> of<00:04:02.940> staying<00:04:03.269> in<00:04:03.570> division<00:04:04.080> fee<00:04:04.290> for

00:04:04.759 --> 00:04:04.769 
instead of staying in division fee for

00:04:04.769 --> 00:04:08.150 
instead of staying in division fee for
one<00:04:05.370> more<00:04:05.580> one<00:04:06.330> more<00:04:06.360> season<00:04:06.750> which<00:04:07.110> yeah<00:04:07.860> I

to list up a bunch of players on the

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:40.310 
to list up a bunch of players on the
transfer<00:04:38.430> list<00:04:38.670> because<00:04:39.030> I<00:04:39.270> wanted<00:04:40.110> to<00:04:40.170> at

00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:40.320 
transfer list because I wanted to at

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:41.750 
transfer list because I wanted to at
least<00:04:40.440> make<00:04:40.650> some<00:04:40.800> temporary<00:04:41.160> changes<00:04:41.700> I

00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:41.760 
least make some temporary changes I

00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:44.000 
least make some temporary changes I
wasn't<00:04:42.180> too<00:04:42.360> sure<00:04:42.390> how<00:04:43.200> much<00:04:43.380> the<00:04:43.560> place<00:04:43.710> at

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:44.010 
wasn't too sure how much the place at

00:04:44.010 --> 00:04:46.040 
wasn't too sure how much the place at
least<00:04:44.040> up<00:04:44.340> would<00:04:44.520> go<00:04:44.790> on<00:04:44.970> to<00:04:45.150> self<00:04:45.480> all<00:04:45.690> because

00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:46.050 
least up would go on to self all because

00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:47.630 
least up would go on to self all because
of<00:04:46.080> the<00:04:46.350> market<00:04:46.710> crash<00:04:46.950> and<00:04:46.980> all<00:04:47.250> that<00:04:47.430> kind<00:04:47.610> of

00:04:47.630 --> 00:04:47.640 
of the market crash and all that kind of

00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:49.700 
of the market crash and all that kind of
stuff<00:04:47.700> so<00:04:48.030> the<00:04:48.600> two<00:04:48.810> squads<00:04:49.020> I'm<00:04:49.320> building

00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:49.710 
stuff so the two squads I'm building

00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:51.560 
stuff so the two squads I'm building
here<00:04:49.860> towards<00:04:50.220> then<00:04:50.370> is<00:04:50.640> temporary<00:04:51.240> squats

00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:51.570 
here towards then is temporary squats

00:04:51.570 --> 00:04:53.240 
here towards then is temporary squats
and<00:04:51.720> they<00:04:52.140> will<00:04:52.260> most<00:04:52.470> likely<00:04:52.710> change<00:04:53.010> and

00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:53.250 
and they will most likely change and

00:04:53.250 --> 00:04:55.070 
and they will most likely change and
either<00:04:53.340> next<00:04:53.820> episode<00:04:54.240> of<00:04:54.390> the<00:04:54.480> episode<00:04:54.660> after

00:04:55.070 --> 00:04:55.080 
either next episode of the episode after

00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:57.110 
either next episode of the episode after
that<00:04:55.410> I'll<00:04:55.680> probably<00:04:56.130> built<00:04:56.520> the<00:04:56.730> temporary

00:04:57.110 --> 00:04:57.120 
that I'll probably built the temporary

00:04:57.120 --> 00:05:00.500 
that I'll probably built the temporary
squad<00:04:57.360> mmm<00:04:57.930> excuse<00:04:58.350> me<00:04:58.500> and<00:04:58.680> then<00:04:59.550> play<00:05:00.270> with

00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:00.510 
squad mmm excuse me and then play with

00:05:00.510 --> 00:05:02.060 
squad mmm excuse me and then play with
them<00:05:00.660> for<00:05:00.840> a<00:05:00.870> few<00:05:00.990> games<00:05:01.200> and<00:05:01.410> figure<00:05:01.800> out<00:05:01.830> what

00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:02.070 
them for a few games and figure out what

00:05:02.070 --> 00:05:05.000 
them for a few games and figure out what
needs<00:05:02.340> changing<00:05:02.850> so<00:05:03.180> yeah<00:05:03.540> it's<00:05:04.320> to<00:05:04.560> temporary

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:05.010 
needs changing so yeah it's to temporary

00:05:05.010 --> 00:05:06.950 
needs changing so yeah it's to temporary
sides<00:05:05.220> and<00:05:05.580> we<00:05:05.820> get<00:05:05.940> a<00:05:06.000> bunch<00:05:06.210> of<00:05:06.360> Colombian

00:05:06.950 --> 00:05:06.960 
sides and we get a bunch of Colombian

00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:08.990 
sides and we get a bunch of Colombian
players<00:05:07.230> mixed<00:05:07.650> up<00:05:07.740> with<00:05:07.980> our<00:05:08.100> Syria<00:05:08.820> a

out<00:05:20.880> a<00:05:21.090> few<00:05:21.660> different<00:05:21.780> things<00:05:22.020> and<00:05:22.410> maybe

00:05:22.790 --> 00:05:22.800 
out a few different things and maybe

00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:24.260 
out a few different things and maybe
will<00:05:23.040> change<00:05:23.370> them<00:05:23.550> up<00:05:23.640> a<00:05:23.760> little<00:05:23.790> bit<00:05:24.120> more
