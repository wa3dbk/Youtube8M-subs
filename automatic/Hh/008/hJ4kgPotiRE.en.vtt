00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:33.110
 power and automatic transmission of 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:35.640
 seven dual clutch speeds 

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:37.790
 establishing new standards of design and 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:37.790
 technology 

00:00:38.989 --> 00:00:43.500
 aimed at audacious young audiences 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:45.270
 and dynamic class A has a design 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:47.670
 quite expressive with a front 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:50.010
 elongated with arrow-shaped lines 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:52.649
 radiator grille with striking lines and 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:54.660
 headlights with bi xenon lamps with lights 

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:57.719
 diurnal circulation integrated in the 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:59.520
 urban version structured back 

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:01.379
 horizontally has a drawing that 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:03.809
 emphasizes the width exalting the 

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:05.700
 athletic ability among their 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:08.040
 highlights is the rear flashlight with 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:09.240
 high performance led lights in the 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:11.550
 urban 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:13.500
 on the sides the lines follow boldly 

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:14.340
 suggesting movement even with the car 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:16.560
 stopped 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:17.790
 full of personality the ceiling line 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:19.650
 Remember a coupe 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:21.660
 rear view mirrors have aerodynamic design 

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:24.210
 and has direction indicator lights 

00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:25.950
 integrated 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:27.990
 Another high point are the alloy wheels 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:30.240
 lightweight design with 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:33.960
 differ in style versions with 16 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:36.030
 inches and one with 17 inches 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:37.830
 the whole design of the exterior of the 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:39.900
 A class not only contemplated beauty 

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:42.360
 but also its aerodynamic efficiency 

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:44.550
 which contributes to the economy in the 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:46.700
 shooting and noise reduction at high 

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:46.700
 velocity 

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:56.410
 the quality of the interior of class a was 

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:57.550
 conceived with a passionate attention 

00:01:56.410 --> 00:02:00.280
 for details 

00:01:57.550 --> 00:02:02.440
 packages and urban style offer the 

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:04.570
 different possibilities of 

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:08.369
 customization is on the 

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:10.950
 instruments frames among other items 

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:13.780
 the lighting and visibility package 

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:15.700
 increases the sense of added value 

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:17.950
 medium of an extensive set of lights 

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:21.400
 internal walls with special emphasis on 

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:23.680
 of the doors lit by being a car 

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:25.660
 with a strong sports appeal the design 

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:27.880
 makes the driver feel 

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:29.530
 inside a real cockpit. 

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:31.720
 banks of class a are unique in 

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:32.590
 segment and provide excellent 

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:34.930
 ergonomics 

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:37.120
 add to this the multifunctional steering wheel 

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:39.400
 with three spokes and 12 function keys 

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:42.430
 instrument panel with four 

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:44.440
 display and 5.8 inch display 

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:47.380
 of high quality that brings together 

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:49.900
 functions such as the 2.0 audio system with 

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:52.510
 CD player and telephone keypad with 

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:54.370
 bluetooth interface and usb and 

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:56.650
 auxiliary the rear seats are 

00:02:54.370 --> 00:03:00.330
 equally sporty in appearance and 

00:02:56.650 --> 00:03:00.330
 can carry up to three passengers 

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:18.640
 one of the portraits of the new dynamism of 

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:19.720
 mercedes fez is the engine design and 

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:22.030
 exchange rate class 

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:24.459
 they were mounted transversely and 

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:26.650
 are new in every detail 

00:03:24.459 --> 00:03:29.010
 the gasoline engine with direct injection and 

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:32.110
 turbocharged four-cylinder engine and 

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:37.319
 1.270 brings together balance and economy with 

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:37.319
 156 horsepower and high torque 

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:49.720
 the eco start stop function and say that 

00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:51.430
 increases efficiency and economy 

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:54.069
 turning off the car whenever it was 

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:55.959
 immobilized and then working again 

00:03:54.069 --> 00:03:58.410
 that the driver stops pressing the 

00:03:55.959 --> 00:03:58.410
 brake pedal 

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:07.769
 engine efficiency is optimized by the 

00:04:04.319 --> 00:04:10.739
 automatic transmission 7g dct with double 

00:04:07.769 --> 00:04:12.870
 clutch with only 86 pounds the exchange 

00:04:10.739 --> 00:04:15.090
 has seven speeds distributed in 

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:16.919
 two transmissions each with their own 

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:19.019
 own clutch with this configuration 

00:04:16.919 --> 00:04:21.840
 gear changes are almost 

00:04:19.019 --> 00:04:23.910
 without loss of tensile strength to 

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:26.130
 use of seven speeds 

00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:28.620
 allows a closer scaling of 

00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:30.810
 making the exchanges smoother and 

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:32.729
 keeping the engine always in the ideal range 

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:34.800
 of torque which is best for 

00:04:32.729 --> 00:04:36.720
 dynamic performance and consumption 

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:39.300
 driver can also opt for the 

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:41.669
 manual shift using shift paddles 

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:43.740
 another particularity of the class 

00:04:41.669 --> 00:04:44.910
 absence of control lever 

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:47.010
 exchange on console 

00:04:44.910 --> 00:04:49.380
 which provides more free space in the 

00:04:47.010 --> 00:04:51.150
 control of the transmission is done 

00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:53.669
 by a small selector lever in the 

00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:56.430
 steering column the exchange offers three 

00:04:53.669 --> 00:04:59.000
 economic and sport driving modes 

00:04:56.430 --> 00:04:59.000
 manual 

00:04:59.930 --> 00:05:04.759
 for mercedes benz security is not a 

00:05:02.449 --> 00:05:07.070
 price specification the specifications of 

00:05:04.759 --> 00:05:09.470
 new class series and include seven air 

00:05:07.070 --> 00:05:11.870
 bags and among other technologies 

00:05:09.470 --> 00:05:14.780
 attention assist systems that detect 

00:05:11.870 --> 00:05:16.970
 driver fatigue and abs brakes that 

00:05:14.780 --> 00:05:19.190
 help the driver in situations of high 

00:05:16.970 --> 00:05:20.539
 and offer more than ten functions 

00:05:19.190 --> 00:05:22.160
 differentiated 

00:05:20.539 --> 00:05:23.780
 the new class coming to market 

00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:25.910
 Brazil in April to establish 

00:05:23.780 --> 00:05:28.729
 new standards with totally 

00:05:25.910 --> 00:05:31.570
 innovative and full of 

00:05:28.729 --> 00:05:31.570
 technological innovations
