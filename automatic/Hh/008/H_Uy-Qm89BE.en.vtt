00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:10.639
 Huge hello to all girls for a long time not 

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:13.049
 it was vlohov therefore decided to do and 

00:00:10.639 --> 00:00:15.780
 today I want to record a video of my own 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:19.880
 such lifelong lifelines 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:21.900
 that is what i love to use and here 

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:24.539
 I painted now I have to finish 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:27.630
 it's like all my mess 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:29.730
 going on there is no creative 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:32.610
 riots called it simple 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:35.239
 bedlam in general computer usually also with 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:38.129
 I take a watch 

00:00:35.239 --> 00:00:41.070
 Bloggers now here on this here's another 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:43.920
 card now look tiffany mike 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:46.350
 get around the background de and was going to be painted 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:49.020
 such make up was made thicker 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:51.390
 arrows and lipstick inflicted 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:53.399
 neutral color I really liked 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:55.170
 it's even more neutral 

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:57.960
 I'll show you some red and pink 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:01:00.809
 you what it looks like before by Engle and 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:02.280
 I put a dark red I do not think that 

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:03.899
 it will look so good for 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:06.210
 Of course, put a very thin layer 

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:07.979
 this red but still i'm nice 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:08.400
 surprised that he looks that way on 

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:12.030
 lips 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:14.100
 nice not yet tried to make more 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:15.810
 thick layer if we talk about the first 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:18.479
 the impression is a little dry 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:21.450
 lips so i still have here 

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:23.850
 so interesting to show here 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:25.590
 this new mascara from L'Oreal sau couture 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:28.290
 I really liked her mascara 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:31.110
 Silicone brush is quite interesting 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:33.390
 and what I liked was incredibly nice 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:35.460
 it smells great and that's when you put 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:37.530
 on the cilia then you slap this 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:39.479
 the smell constantly reaches the nose 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:40.950
 have it constantly feel very 

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:42.810
 I liked what you can do as 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:46.200
 natural effect and more 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:48.299
 dramatic but this one doesn't attach 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:50.640
 volume and it is longer for lengthening works 

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:52.710
 and separation and also this is the first mascara 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:54.540
 me in a collection which is filmed as 

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:56.219
 stockings that is, it is not smeared in 

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:59.430
 such a black spot where are you trying 

00:01:56.219 --> 00:02:01.500
 wash off the mascara and wash it off like 

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:04.430
 stockings with eyelashes really me too 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:09.869
 Liked in this series su couture new 

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:12.230
 liner show what it looks like liner 

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:14.599
 a brush comprising a brush 

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:17.629
 many villi and thanks to this 

00:02:14.599 --> 00:02:20.060
 constantly the product reaches the tip 

00:02:17.629 --> 00:02:21.440
 This brush, that is, I do not dry up 

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:24.260
 herself a big lover fail 

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:26.330
 felt-tip pens but with wind tips 

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:26.659
 for example, there was always a problem here 

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:29.299
 also 

00:02:26.659 --> 00:02:31.519
 same from loreal felt tip 

00:02:29.299 --> 00:02:33.680
 constantly dries the tip 

00:02:31.519 --> 00:02:36.560
 when you do even on the first eye 

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:38.900
 the arrow I usually still bring the arrow 

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:42.349
 in view of the arrow over the shadows it means 

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:44.870
 dries up somehow polluted and on 

00:02:42.349 --> 00:02:46.970
 the second eye is already there I do not really need 

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:48.410
 don't dance dance around this liner 

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:50.540
 so that you can apply 

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:53.329
 but this one is just super easy for you 

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:55.609
 I advise girls note though 

00:02:53.329 --> 00:02:57.620
 would just shake the store I'm sure 

00:02:55.609 --> 00:02:59.660
 you will like it altogether since 

00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:01.250
 we have it all with you I took apart 

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:02.060
 already managed again and clean and 

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:05.690
 sort out 

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:07.700
 give mom sister and mom Tess the green 

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:09.950
 the work that I just had in 

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:11.870
 multiple copies or something that I don’t 

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:13.700
 It was generally suitable for a long time already 

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:15.379
 shoot an updated video about your 

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:16.669
 cosmetics storage collections so 

00:03:15.379 --> 00:03:20.299
 if you're interested be sure to support 

00:03:16.669 --> 00:03:22.489
 my idea of this finger up so but for now 

00:03:20.299 --> 00:03:24.440
 I'll tell you quickly what I like there 

00:03:22.489 --> 00:03:27.349
 I disassembled in the second box I still have 

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:30.410
 stored eyelashes overhead the third box 

00:03:27.349 --> 00:03:33.769
 all that I have left of jewelry 

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:36.169
 also gave my sister and mother something that was no longer 

00:03:33.769 --> 00:03:37.819
 I used everything in this box 

00:03:36.169 --> 00:03:40.130
 what's left of the motifs cosmetics 

00:03:37.819 --> 00:03:43.160
 remember I had a huge parcel 

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:43.910
 somehow disappointed to be honest in this 

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:47.810
 cosmetics 

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:51.829
 I kept this cream powder for myself 

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:56.389
 foundation and she is pretty for pretty 

00:03:51.829 --> 00:03:58.099
 very dry skin but I thought once 

00:03:56.389 --> 00:03:59.329
 used maybe then it will be cool 

00:03:58.099 --> 00:04:02.060
 I have a different opinion 

00:03:59.329 --> 00:04:04.459
 once again give her a chance left this powder 

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:07.220
 huge right there she is like transparent 

00:04:04.459 --> 00:04:09.799
 light but somehow I don’t know anything 

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:12.260
 Does not matte in general makeup especially 

00:04:09.799 --> 00:04:14.030
 does not fix the only thing that I more 

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:17.479
 less liked this shade here i am 

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:20.209
 shifted to this palette and now in this one 

00:04:17.479 --> 00:04:21.979
 motifs cosmetic palettes are pretty good 

00:04:20.209 --> 00:04:24.180
 shadows and nothing like that right you know 

00:04:21.979 --> 00:04:27.570
 shaft and worth everyone buying 

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:29.940
 but well pigmented slack 

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:32.190
 showered and in that sense 

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:34.949
 I also liked 

00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:36.750
 pigments from all series of motifs cosmetic 

00:04:34.949 --> 00:04:37.530
 I liked this one 

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:41.150
 series 

00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:43.199
 and a tidy series like this though 

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:45.240
 square costs her the most 

00:04:43.199 --> 00:04:47.850
 square I did not like the texture 

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:49.949
 they are almost all with incomprehensible 

00:04:47.850 --> 00:04:51.449
 overflow and in this box I have stored 

00:04:49.949 --> 00:04:53.100
 extra brushes 

00:04:51.449 --> 00:04:55.020
 if you notice something on my table 

00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:57.930
 worth the most necessary amount 

00:04:55.020 --> 00:05:00.030
 brushes and why I began to do so 

00:04:57.930 --> 00:05:02.340
 because the more I insert there 

00:05:00.030 --> 00:05:03.210
 the more I pack the more I 

00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:05.940
 I use 

00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:08.250
 That is, I use different brushes and better 

00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:10.289
 let me be here in stock when 

00:05:08.250 --> 00:05:12.509
 there will be some brush will fail 

00:05:10.289 --> 00:05:15.330
 take from here well and plus these brushes I 

00:05:12.509 --> 00:05:18.840
 for example could I paint people and 

00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:21.180
 my last box is just such a box 

00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:23.490
 for scrap materials mainly for 

00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:26.340
 cosmetic bags become if we talk about the shelf 

00:05:23.490 --> 00:05:29.010
 Remember I asked you and advise 

00:05:26.340 --> 00:05:31.080
 what can I buy here how to decorate 

00:05:29.010 --> 00:05:34.020
 for now I’ve just put it on here 

00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:37.349
 the order is differently laid out some 

00:05:34.020 --> 00:05:39.780
 things and did not buy anything 

00:05:37.349 --> 00:05:42.240
 because we will make repairs in this 

00:05:39.780 --> 00:05:43.979
 the room will repaint the walls now 

00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:44.580
 not so cold them just me 

00:05:43.979 --> 00:05:48.030
 the order 

00:05:44.580 --> 00:05:49.699
 so let's say on the bed picked up a dress 

00:05:48.030 --> 00:05:52.349
 on one 

00:05:49.699 --> 00:05:55.889
 upcoming events about this too you 

00:05:52.349 --> 00:05:59.310
 learn will shoot vlog and so far so 

00:05:55.889 --> 00:06:01.199
 everything is in disarray by the way clothes and also 

00:05:59.310 --> 00:06:03.570
 already sorted out dispose of what 

00:06:01.199 --> 00:06:06.780
 don't need to hand out things that i don't 

00:06:03.570 --> 00:06:09.389
 suitable and now you need to remove the sweaters 

00:06:06.780 --> 00:06:09.870
 I already hope that we will have too soon 

00:06:09.389 --> 00:06:12.060
 summer 

00:06:09.870 --> 00:06:14.880
 although it is cold now honestly with us 

00:06:12.060 --> 00:06:17.190
 somewhere 8 degrees yesterday was also already 

00:06:14.880 --> 00:06:20.280
 cooler but still less 

00:06:17.190 --> 00:06:22.110
 spring raids look like weekend i 

00:06:20.280 --> 00:06:25.259
 bathed four times on the weekend with us 

00:06:22.110 --> 00:06:27.900
 the breeze was just fabulous waiting 

00:06:25.259 --> 00:06:30.030
 I hope that at least again 

00:06:27.900 --> 00:06:31.530
 the forecast promises 6 will be warm but 

00:06:30.030 --> 00:06:34.409
 girls will say goodbye to you 

00:06:31.530 --> 00:06:36.120
 by the way, if you're interested, then we won't wake up 

00:06:34.409 --> 00:06:38.550
 who already showed you 

00:06:36.120 --> 00:06:41.880
 in a video about their clothes purchases 

00:06:38.550 --> 00:06:45.000
 ordered it with romwe adore it and here 

00:06:41.880 --> 00:06:47.190
 these are my shorts last year 

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:49.229
 I bought food in the dawn and now shoot 

00:06:47.190 --> 00:06:53.060
 videos about their masters 

00:06:49.229 --> 00:06:53.060
 I have my purchases bye
