00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.720
 one of the primary waves to valparaíso feels comfortable minor b boom 

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:04.670
 sonic 

00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:08.800
 windows and buildings shake some of the primary waves come out 

00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:10.289
 fired into the atmosphere 

00:00:10.289 --> 00:00:13.289
 emitting a spooky roar 

00:00:17.269 --> 00:00:20.769
 the secondary probe that carries most of the energy of the 

00:00:20.769 --> 00:00:21.429
 earthquake 

00:00:21.429 --> 00:00:25.140
 some surface waves go to the ground from one side to another double roads of 

00:00:25.139 --> 00:00:28.139
 train and tear up structures not prepared for earthquakes 

00:00:31.039 --> 00:00:34.039
 the foundations of buildings is destabilized 

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:44.640
 the unstable areas of the cliffs that surround Valparaíso are collapsing 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:47.640
 taking with them the vulnerable buildings 

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:53.390
 down in the port the sediments amplify the seismic energy and 

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:56.390
 prolong the shaking 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:01.190
 the liquefaction breaks the main water gas pipes and the tracks 

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:04.190
 Communication 

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:10.060
 some of the areas of the coast are submerged up to two meters 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:15.100
 poorly designed structures collapse and the flood grows 

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:17.230
 wantonly 

00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:20.230
 broken gas pipes can cause fires 

00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:24.579
 while the city will already be paralyzed and vulnerable 

00:01:24.579 --> 00:01:27.579
 a much bigger danger is about to appear 

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:33.250
 One side of the wave rushes towards the coast of Chile 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:37.470
 it takes only 10 minutes to get to the sea 

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:42.230
 the city has been demolished with an ocean water wall of 12 meters 

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:45.230
 height that breaks as it makes its way through the city 

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:53.770
 thousands more people can lose their lives 

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:56.430
 the city is devastated 

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:59.840
 but the deadly reach of the gigantic earthquake extends far beyond 

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:00.510
 From Chile
