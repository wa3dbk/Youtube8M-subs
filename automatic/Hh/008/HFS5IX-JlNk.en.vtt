00:00:12.499 --> 00:00:12.509 
guys you're going to start off by

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:14.299 
guys you're going to start off by
sectioning<00:00:12.719> a<00:00:13.290> triangle<00:00:13.799> section<00:00:14.099> from<00:00:14.219> your

00:00:14.299 --> 00:00:14.309 
sectioning a triangle section from your

sectioning a triangle section from your
hair<00:00:14.549> and<00:00:14.790> splitting<00:00:15.089> it<00:00:15.210> into<00:00:15.330> two<00:00:15.450> and<00:00:15.839> then

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:16.410 
hair and splitting it into two and then

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:17.510 
hair and splitting it into two and then
you're<00:00:16.529> going<00:00:16.680> to<00:00:16.770> wrote<00:00:16.949> braid<00:00:17.190> with<00:00:17.369> it

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:17.520 
you're going to wrote braid with it

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:18.680 
you're going to wrote braid with it
basically<00:00:17.789> what<00:00:18.150> you're<00:00:18.270> going<00:00:18.359> to<00:00:18.449> do<00:00:18.570> is

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:18.690 
basically what you're going to do is

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:21.050 
basically what you're going to do is
twist<00:00:18.960> the<00:00:19.289> two<00:00:20.070> sections<00:00:20.430> towards<00:00:20.820> your<00:00:20.910> face

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:21.060 
twist the two sections towards your face

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:22.550 
twist the two sections towards your face
and<00:00:21.300> then<00:00:21.449> wrap<00:00:21.600> them<00:00:21.779> away<00:00:22.080> from<00:00:22.260> your<00:00:22.380> face

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:22.560 
and then wrap them away from your face

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:24.890 
and then wrap them away from your face
and<00:00:22.800> the<00:00:23.609> easiest<00:00:23.880> way<00:00:24.029> to<00:00:24.060> do<00:00:24.240> this<00:00:24.269> is<00:00:24.480> twist

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:24.900 
and the easiest way to do this is twist

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:26.630 
and the easiest way to do this is twist
all<00:00:25.109> the<00:00:25.170> way<00:00:25.380> down<00:00:25.619> the<00:00:25.800> hair<00:00:25.980> and<00:00:26.130> then<00:00:26.400> wrap

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:26.640 
all the way down the hair and then wrap

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:29.269 
all the way down the hair and then wrap
it<00:00:26.880> but<00:00:27.480> I<00:00:27.720> think<00:00:28.080> was<00:00:28.380> actually<00:00:28.529> the<00:00:28.830> best

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:29.279 
it but I think was actually the best

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:31.310 
it but I think was actually the best
thing<00:00:29.400> for<00:00:29.519> me<00:00:29.939> is<00:00:30.150> actually<00:00:30.539> to<00:00:30.660> twist<00:00:30.929> as<00:00:31.109> I

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:31.320 
thing for me is actually to twist as I

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:33.590 
thing for me is actually to twist as I
go<00:00:31.500> and<00:00:31.650> wrap<00:00:31.800> it<00:00:31.920> as<00:00:32.070> I<00:00:32.219> go<00:00:32.329> but<00:00:33.329> that<00:00:33.420> might<00:00:33.570> be

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:33.600 
go and wrap it as I go but that might be

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:34.910 
go and wrap it as I go but that might be
a<00:00:33.690> little<00:00:33.930> bit<00:00:34.020> tricky<00:00:34.320> so<00:00:34.500> this<00:00:34.649> is<00:00:34.770> your

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:34.920 
a little bit tricky so this is your

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:36.380 
a little bit tricky so this is your
first<00:00:35.100> time<00:00:35.280> doing<00:00:35.340> a<00:00:35.579> rope<00:00:35.730> braid<00:00:35.910> just<00:00:36.149> twist

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:36.390 
first time doing a rope braid just twist

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:38.450 
first time doing a rope braid just twist
all<00:00:36.600> the<00:00:36.660> way<00:00:36.930> down<00:00:37.140> your<00:00:37.260> hair<00:00:37.320> and<00:00:37.710> wrap<00:00:38.340> it
