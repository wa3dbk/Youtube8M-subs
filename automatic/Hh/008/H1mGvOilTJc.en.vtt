00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:09.090
 great 2015 

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:11.160
 meanwhile there will be fewer events as a background 

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:13.019
 of the pay per view which will be brock lesnar 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:15.330
 47 ronin if I take advantage of it anyway 

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:17.670
 tell you that there is now double of 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:19.560
 network in Italy is therefore available 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:20.039
 if maybe there's someone watching ip 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:22.740
 per view 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:25.890
 I don't know in streaming or stuff so oh well 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:26.460
 from 10 euros a month do it or less than 10 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:28.410
 euros per month 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:29.670
 b from having so much stuff to 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:31.500
 layout 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:33.899
 I've already used it even more 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:35.969
 I tell you that you have all the pay 

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:37.410
 for view of the available history 

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:39.510
 of something that can also be improved from 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:42.570
 visitable yes dabliu all rijkaard 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:46.200
 of the episodes of roda to 1990 and something 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:49.410
 dvd the specials the pre show extras 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:51.829
 and kick off and extreme edition really 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:54.750
 a cool 10 euros a month 

00:00:51.829 --> 00:00:56.850
 very good and obviously every 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:58.710
 month also the ppv included so if 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:00.899
 maybe I want to buy on sky how many 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:03.690
 at 15 euros with david harvey network e 

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:05.640
 you have all the stuff plus gamers a 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:07.560
 10 euros so even five golds less 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:09.750
 however let's start quickly 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:12.060
 from kick off that art ruud against king 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:13.650
 barrett here I did not understand well maybe who 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:16.159
 wins wins the title of king of the 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:19.500
 rings try to dear right for 

00:01:16.159 --> 00:01:21.060
 fill all the little woods 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:23.310
 preparation of the match does not care 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:25.740
 nothing I already king barrett since there is 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:26.220
 Stuff is up for grabs but really who if 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:27.689
 cares 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:30.090
 let's now move on to the first post of 

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:32.240
 show real chapters top team e 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:34.350
 on the brenta in players against my gods 

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:35.189
 players who have won their own titles 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:37.320
 against new day 

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:39.119
 I tiferò for the new day because daisies 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:41.640
 great even if in the end I think 

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:44.310
 I will win thirty years in division players 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:47.850
 really very low level detecting 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:50.340
 towards the end two of the pocts challenge each other 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:52.320
 in real we are hopefully they have 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:54.869
 something in mind for son slam for the 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:57.630
 many category now we pass Rome 

00:01:54.869 --> 00:02:00.119
 drain clash play wyatt well this is 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:01.860
 the white was built very well 

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:04.170
 always comes back to break like every time 

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:06.479
 we were at some extra motivation 

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:07.659
 it is not simple to consider this 

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:09.970
 but if I had to pull 

00:02:07.659 --> 00:02:11.260
 roman reines absolutely this 

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:14.319
 I think it should be true 

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:16.450
 universe of roman reigns the per card no 

00:02:14.319 --> 00:02:17.440
 name and snow up until when he knows here I want more 

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:18.790
 that good 

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:20.349
 ah yes it is true then I forgot you 

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:22.030
 let me know your predictions 

00:02:20.349 --> 00:02:23.530
 the other time there was one that still 

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:25.720
 I guess everyone really doesn't know 

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:28.239
 sometimes how does someone has 

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:30.430
 morelli garden encounter sheamus code 

00:02:28.239 --> 00:02:31.269
 sheamus dai can't lose mister money 

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:32.980
 in the bank 

00:02:31.269 --> 00:02:35.260
 indeed it is not true that he cannot lose 

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:37.989
 it then depends on how they build it if how 

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:40.629
 bastard who loses then takes revenge as 

00:02:37.989 --> 00:02:43.510
 a pretty solid randy version 

00:02:40.629 --> 00:02:45.370
 orton instead boh okay is getting old 

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:47.950
 obviously they are not doing it 

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:50.019
 do some john dinner throw i 

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:51.640
 young and stuff so they are treating a 

00:02:50.019 --> 00:02:54.069
 a little differently and we talked 

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:55.030
 john's dinner and still talk about don dinner 

00:02:54.069 --> 00:02:57.220
 because we have his match against 

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:58.299
 canine and this time for the title of 

00:02:57.220 --> 00:03:00.790
 United States 

00:02:58.299 --> 00:03:03.459
 this must be a nice evening 

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:05.709
 dai must be the new living room 

00:03:03.459 --> 00:03:08.140
 sample everyone at home then there are also 

00:03:05.709 --> 00:03:10.959
 the Russian unknowns weighed above all 

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:12.849
 chimney months must win must prove 

00:03:10.959 --> 00:03:15.250
 again that can win clean 

00:03:12.849 --> 00:03:18.519
 we are once you bring the title home and 

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:22.510
 by I will shamelessly for kevin 

00:03:18.519 --> 00:03:25.870
 owen must win with a capital d and then 

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:27.880
 let's pass inherently set ronis defends the 

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:30.970
 his title dhabi lobby against brock 

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:32.919
 lesnar when blog is back said enough 

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:34.840
 Excavation announcements I will present in the menu 

00:03:32.919 --> 00:03:37.359
 that all his henchmen that in 

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:38.440
 adds sécurité etc. etc. not 

00:03:37.359 --> 00:03:41.230
 help him 

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:43.840
 here is rock lazard trumpeted everyone 

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:45.970
 week to week to injured la 

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:46.569
 cryolite kindness practically killed 

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:50.139
 game 

00:03:46.569 --> 00:03:54.209
 so we have seth rogen only against the 

00:03:50.139 --> 00:03:57.400
 cleaner beast no to disqualify 

00:03:54.209 --> 00:03:59.530
 or something else happens 

00:03:57.400 --> 00:04:02.079
 there are quite reliable sources that 

00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:03.849
 they say a certain thing I won't spoil you 

00:04:02.079 --> 00:04:06.819
 and quiet because maybe it isn't either 

00:04:03.849 --> 00:04:09.780
 true, however, these sources say one thing 

00:04:06.819 --> 00:04:11.889
 then who knows who knows how to do something 

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:14.050
 fichissima I do not want to say anything 

00:04:11.889 --> 00:04:15.790
 because I will not shoot you do not want 

00:04:14.050 --> 00:04:18.070
 nothing especially I don't want it 

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:20.170
 ruin me even though I know it by now 

00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:22.330
 this is not spoiler it is nothing because 

00:04:20.170 --> 00:04:24.760
 still has not been broadcast it is not known if 

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:27.640
 then the sources will really happen 

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:29.680
 they are quite reliable if I don't 

00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:31.330
 so spoiler news apart where you say mine 

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:33.610
 prediction I would say that if it finds linz in 

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:35.530
 somehow it remains champion though 

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:38.050
 on paper it is very difficult though 

00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:40.540
 remains champion at the end to get out of 

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:42.700
 shop run with title he will be gufata 

00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:44.620
 sensational and therefore these were mine 

00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:46.720
 predictions for macs debating ground not 

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:48.790
 they are many matches but all world champions 

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:50.560
 he will be a transition baby 

00:04:48.790 --> 00:04:52.480
 probably precisely because summerslam 

00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:54.220
 to the next and from the wait for us 

00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:56.620
 probably a great summerslam 

00:04:54.220 --> 00:04:59.200
 let me know these predictive posts 

00:04:56.620 --> 00:05:01.030
 let's see on another the guesses and do me 

00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:02.710
 also know what you think of my and 

00:05:01.030 --> 00:05:04.480
 if video you liked to slow down 

00:05:02.710 --> 00:05:08.850
 written to my channel and comment later 

00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:08.850
 been used all bye to all
