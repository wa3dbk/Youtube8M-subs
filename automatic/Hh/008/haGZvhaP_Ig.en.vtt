ok<00:02:37.650> the<00:02:37.890> next<00:02:37.920> one's<00:02:38.310> that<00:02:38.370> we're<00:02:38.550> gonna<00:02:38.640> be

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:38.820 
ok the next one's that we're gonna be

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:42.830 
ok the next one's that we're gonna be
dealing<00:02:38.970> with<00:02:39.150> E<00:02:40.519> minor<00:02:41.519> 7<00:02:41.880> F<00:02:42.000> sharp<00:02:42.300> minor<00:02:42.420> 7

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:42.840 
dealing with E minor 7 F sharp minor 7

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:45.320 
dealing with E minor 7 F sharp minor 7
and<00:02:42.900> the<00:02:42.989> G<00:02:43.140> major<00:02:43.380> 7<00:02:43.590> very<00:02:44.430> similar<00:02:44.910> idea<00:02:45.269> I

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:45.330 
and the G major 7 very similar idea I

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:47.210 
and the G major 7 very similar idea I
guess<00:02:45.630> that<00:02:45.840> a<00:02:45.930> minor<00:02:46.170> 7<00:02:46.530> looks<00:02:46.680> exactly<00:02:46.980> the

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:47.220 
guess that a minor 7 looks exactly the

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:48.890 
guess that a minor 7 looks exactly the
same<00:02:47.310> as<00:02:47.519> what<00:02:47.790> we<00:02:47.910> had<00:02:48.030> for<00:02:48.209> the<00:02:48.269> B<00:02:48.390> minor<00:02:48.660> 7

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:48.900 
same as what we had for the B minor 7

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:52.520 
same as what we had for the B minor 7
but<00:02:49.470> from<00:02:49.680> the<00:02:49.800> 5th<00:02:50.010> string<00:02:51.320> 7/10<00:02:52.320> on<00:02:52.440> the

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:52.530 
but from the 5th string 7/10 on the

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:54.470 
but from the 5th string 7/10 on the
fifth<00:02:52.769> 9<00:02:53.310> of<00:02:53.489> the<00:02:53.580> fourth<00:02:53.820> and<00:02:54.030> seven<00:02:54.360> for

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:54.480 
fifth 9 of the fourth and seven for

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:57.680 
fifth 9 of the fourth and seven for
third<00:02:55.790> ok<00:02:56.790> then<00:02:57.030> I'm<00:02:57.120> just<00:02:57.269> looking<00:02:57.540> at<00:02:57.630> a

00:02:57.680 --> 00:02:57.690 
third ok then I'm just looking at a

00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:01.130 
third ok then I'm just looking at a
straight<00:02:57.989> F<00:02:58.200> sharp<00:02:58.470> minor<00:02:58.590> 7<00:02:59.750> so<00:03:00.750> I'm<00:03:00.870> playing

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:01.140 
straight F sharp minor 7 so I'm playing

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:03.920 
straight F sharp minor 7 so I'm playing
9<00:03:01.680> of<00:03:01.890> the<00:03:02.040> fifth<00:03:02.400> and<00:03:02.700> then<00:03:03.090> 7-eleven<00:03:03.750> on<00:03:03.840> the

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:03.930 
9 of the fifth and then 7-eleven on the

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:06.380 
9 of the fifth and then 7-eleven on the
4th<00:03:04.200> and<00:03:04.500> then<00:03:04.950> what<00:03:05.730> have<00:03:05.820> I<00:03:05.910> got<00:03:06.090> here

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:06.390 
4th and then what have I got here

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:10.100 
4th and then what have I got here
9<00:03:07.110> of<00:03:07.140> the<00:03:07.560> 3rd<00:03:08.570> ok<00:03:09.570> then<00:03:09.720> we're<00:03:09.840> gonna<00:03:09.930> work

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:10.110 
9 of the 3rd ok then we're gonna work

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:12.289 
9 of the 3rd ok then we're gonna work
through<00:03:10.290> a<00:03:10.380> G<00:03:10.620> major<00:03:10.830> 7<00:03:11.130> very<00:03:11.519> similar<00:03:12.060> to<00:03:12.150> what

00:03:12.289 --> 00:03:12.299 
through a G major 7 very similar to what

00:03:12.299 --> 00:03:14.030 
through a G major 7 very similar to what
we<00:03:12.390> saw<00:03:12.570> on<00:03:12.600> the<00:03:12.840> day<00:03:13.049> we<00:03:13.620> just<00:03:13.650> have<00:03:13.920> to

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:14.040 
we saw on the day we just have to

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:15.560 
we saw on the day we just have to
shuffle<00:03:14.280> on<00:03:14.549> the<00:03:14.640> B<00:03:14.790> string<00:03:14.850> so<00:03:15.360> I'm<00:03:15.420> gonna

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:02.340 
from the a7 chord a 7 arpeggio is going

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:04.250 
from the a7 chord a 7 arpeggio is going
to<00:04:02.400> start<00:04:02.670> from<00:04:03.000> 7<00:04:03.420> of<00:04:03.510> the<00:04:03.599> 4th<00:04:03.810> string<00:04:03.959> I'm

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:04.260 
to start from 7 of the 4th string I'm

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:07.100 
to start from 7 of the 4th string I'm
going<00:04:04.290> to<00:04:04.440> play<00:04:04.560> 7<00:04:05.010> 11<00:04:05.459> and<00:04:05.610> then<00:04:06.360> 9<00:04:06.569> of<00:04:06.750> the<00:04:06.840> 3rd

those with the B minor
so<00:04:15.330> what<00:04:15.420> I'm<00:04:15.510> doing<00:04:15.540> here<00:04:15.750> is<00:04:15.900> I'm<00:04:16.049> playing

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:16.320 
so what I'm doing here is I'm playing

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:19.070 
so what I'm doing here is I'm playing
nine<00:04:16.950> of<00:04:17.130> the<00:04:17.250> 4th<00:04:17.489> 7-eleven<00:04:18.419> on<00:04:18.479> the<00:04:18.630> 3rd<00:04:18.810> and

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:26.880 
C sharp minor 7 flat 5 very similar to

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:28.400 
C sharp minor 7 flat 5 very similar to
what<00:04:26.970> we<00:04:27.120> had<00:04:27.330> just<00:04:27.630> with<00:04:27.990> some<00:04:28.169> slightly

what we had just with some slightly

00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:29.180 
what we had just with some slightly
different<00:04:28.560> notes

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:29.190 
different notes

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:31.430 
different notes
I<00:04:29.280> guess<00:04:29.580> I'm<00:04:29.940> playing<00:04:30.270> 11<00:04:30.599> of<00:04:30.690> the<00:04:30.810> 4th<00:04:31.050> string

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:31.440 
I guess I'm playing 11 of the 4th string

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:35.450 
I guess I'm playing 11 of the 4th string
9<00:04:32.430> of<00:04:32.640> the<00:04:32.760> third<00:04:32.970> and<00:04:33.240> then<00:04:33.300> a<00:04:33.450> of<00:04:33.479> the<00:04:33.720> 2nd<00:04:34.460> row

let's take it from the top and then

00:04:54.640 --> 00:05:06.680 
let's take it from the top and then
we'll<00:04:54.760> add<00:04:54.880> the<00:04:54.910> last<00:04:55.180> little<00:04:55.420> chalk<00:04:55.660> to<00:04:55.870> it
