Memorial<00:00:37.559> Day<00:00:37.680> coupons<00:00:38.329> so<00:00:39.329> I<00:00:39.719> thought<00:00:40.590> that

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:40.739 
Memorial Day coupons so I thought that

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:42.020 
Memorial Day coupons so I thought that
was<00:00:40.860> a<00:00:40.890> pretty<00:00:41.100> good<00:00:41.250> deal<00:00:41.399> for<00:00:41.460> that<00:00:41.670> book

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:42.030 
was a pretty good deal for that book

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:45.650 
was a pretty good deal for that book
it's<00:00:42.420> a<00:00:42.450> nice<00:00:42.629> book<00:00:43.010> so<00:00:44.010> anyway<00:00:44.450> here's<00:00:45.450> the

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660 
it's a nice book so anyway here's the

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:48.260 
it's a nice book so anyway here's the
first<00:00:45.809> page<00:00:46.140> and<00:00:46.770> I<00:00:47.129> did<00:00:47.340> most<00:00:47.579> of<00:00:47.700> the<00:00:47.789> mats<00:00:48.000> in

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:48.270 
first page and I did most of the mats in

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:50.660 
first page and I did most of the mats in
4x6<00:00:48.989> just<00:00:49.469> because<00:00:49.739> that's<00:00:49.980> what<00:00:50.190> most<00:00:50.340> people

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670 
4x6 just because that's what most people

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:53.270 
4x6 just because that's what most people
get<00:00:50.789> their<00:00:50.969> pictures<00:00:51.360> printed<00:00:51.809> off<00:00:52.050> at<00:00:52.320> so<00:00:53.129> she

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
get their pictures printed off at so she

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:55.700 
get their pictures printed off at so she
can<00:00:53.579> just<00:00:53.760> stick<00:00:54.059> the<00:00:54.239> pictures<00:00:54.600> in<00:00:54.809> here<00:00:55.050> and

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
can just stick the pictures in here and

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:58.400 
can just stick the pictures in here and
most<00:00:56.640> of<00:00:56.820> actually<00:00:57.600> all<00:00:57.719> of<00:00:57.750> them<00:00:57.960> are<00:00:58.109> double

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:58.410 
most of actually all of them are double

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:01.670 
most of actually all of them are double
matted<00:00:58.739> so<00:00:59.600> but<00:01:00.600> this<00:01:00.690> is<00:01:00.870> the<00:01:01.020> first<00:01:01.260> page<00:01:01.469> it

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 
matted so but this is the first page it

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:06.469
