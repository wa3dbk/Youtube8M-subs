the<00:00:23.910> rocks<00:00:24.119> on<00:00:24.330> the<00:00:24.420> switch<00:00:24.660> and<00:00:24.900> he<00:00:25.350> does

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:25.529 
the rocks on the switch and he does

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:27.830 
the rocks on the switch and he does
switch<00:00:25.800> into<00:00:26.039> suicune<00:00:26.519> goes<00:00:27.269> for<00:00:27.480> the<00:00:27.570> skull

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:27.840 
switch into suicune goes for the skull

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:29.359 
switch into suicune goes for the skull
but<00:00:27.869> I'm<00:00:28.170> not<00:00:28.289> really<00:00:28.439> bothered<00:00:28.740> because<00:00:29.130> I

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:29.369 
but I'm not really bothered because I

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:31.279 
but I'm not really bothered because I
can<00:00:29.519> go<00:00:29.670> for<00:00:29.939> the<00:00:30.150> toxic<00:00:30.660> and<00:00:30.779> I<00:00:30.840> need<00:00:31.109> the

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:31.289 
can go for the toxic and I need the

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:33.920 
can go for the toxic and I need the
toxic<00:00:31.800> on<00:00:31.949> him<00:00:32.099> and<00:00:32.250> if<00:00:32.850> he's<00:00:33.030> a<00:00:33.059> rest<00:00:33.450> talking

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:33.930 
toxic on him and if he's a rest talking

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:36.650 
toxic on him and if he's a rest talking
said<00:00:34.170> then<00:00:34.469> my<00:00:35.399> shame<00:00:35.610> is<00:00:35.640> just<00:00:36.090> basically

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:36.660 
said then my shame is just basically

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:38.840 
said then my shame is just basically
safe<00:00:37.020> so<00:00:37.950> I'm<00:00:38.129> going<00:00:38.160> to<00:00:38.340> switch<00:00:38.550> into<00:00:38.670> my

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:38.850 
safe so I'm going to switch into my

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:40.720 
safe so I'm going to switch into my
shame<00:00:39.120> and<00:00:39.300> now<00:00:39.360> as<00:00:39.510> he<00:00:39.660> decides<00:00:39.989> to<00:00:40.110> call<00:00:40.379> mine

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:40.730 
shame and now as he decides to call mine

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:43.729 
shame and now as he decides to call mine
now<00:00:41.730> I'm<00:00:42.420> actually<00:00:42.629> thinking<00:00:43.020> he<00:00:43.350> might<00:00:43.530> have

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:43.739 
now I'm actually thinking he might have

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:45.740 
now I'm actually thinking he might have
the<00:00:43.890> rest<00:00:44.160> but<00:00:44.520> if<00:00:44.670> he<00:00:44.820> does<00:00:45.030> have<00:00:45.210> the<00:00:45.360> rest<00:00:45.570> i

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750 
the rest but if he does have the rest i

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:48.229 
the rest but if he does have the rest i
still<00:00:45.989> have<00:00:46.170> the<00:00:46.200> seed<00:00:46.890> flare<00:00:47.129> which<00:00:48.030> has<00:00:48.210> a

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239 
still have the seed flare which has a

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:51.139 
still have the seed flare which has a
high<00:00:48.480> chance<00:00:48.809> of<00:00:49.579> lowering<00:00:50.579> the<00:00:50.850> special

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149 
high chance of lowering the special

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:53.119 
high chance of lowering the special
defense<00:00:51.449> by<00:00:51.629> two<00:00:51.690> so<00:00:52.170> I'm<00:00:52.350> gonna<00:00:52.530> go<00:00:52.739> for<00:00:53.039> it

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.129 
defense by two so I'm gonna go for it

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:54.889 
defense by two so I'm gonna go for it
hidden<00:00:53.370> power<00:00:53.610> ice<00:00:53.850> predicting<00:00:54.510> the<00:00:54.629> switch

00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:54.899 
hidden power ice predicting the switch

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:57.439 
hidden power ice predicting the switch
into<00:00:55.289> altaria<00:00:55.920> but<00:00:56.579> he<00:00:56.699> decides<00:00:57.000> to<00:00:57.149> stay<00:00:57.329> in

00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:57.449 
into altaria but he decides to stay in

00:00:57.449 --> 00:00:59.389 
into altaria but he decides to stay in

does go for the combined with the toxic
racking<00:01:09.119> up<00:01:09.210> now<00:01:09.900> I'm<00:01:10.080> gonna<00:01:10.260> get<00:01:10.409> a<00:01:10.439> critical

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
racking up now I'm gonna get a critical

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:14.270 
racking up now I'm gonna get a critical
hit<00:01:11.040> on<00:01:11.220> the<00:01:11.600> sea<00:01:12.600> floor<00:01:12.780> and<00:01:13.080> he<00:01:13.680> was<00:01:13.860> going

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
hit on the sea floor and he was going

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:17.120 
hit on the sea floor and he was going
for<00:01:14.310> the<00:01:14.580> rest<00:01:14.850> but<00:01:15.720> in<00:01:15.900> the<00:01:16.080> end<00:01:16.110> sleep<00:01:16.860> talk

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
for the rest but in the end sleep talk

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:21.580 
for the rest but in the end sleep talk
is<00:01:17.310> always<00:01:17.640> pretty<00:01:18.650> unreliable<00:01:19.650> and<00:01:20.310> I<00:01:20.880> mean

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:21.590 
is always pretty unreliable and I mean

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:25.330 
is always pretty unreliable and I mean
kind<00:01:22.590> of<00:01:22.680> hoping<00:01:22.979> for<00:01:23.340> schools<00:01:24.330> were

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:25.340 
kind of hoping for schools were

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:27.890 
kind of hoping for schools were
Carmine's<00:01:26.340> from<00:01:26.610> the<00:01:26.759> rest<00:01:27.090> talk<00:01:27.270> I<00:01:27.420> mean<00:01:27.630> then

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900 
Carmine's from the rest talk I mean then

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:29.240 
Carmine's from the rest talk I mean then
then<00:01:28.259> again<00:01:28.350> I<00:01:28.500> could<00:01:28.590> have<00:01:28.799> gotten<00:01:28.979> some

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
then again I could have gotten some

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:31.249 
then again I could have gotten some

00:04:00.719 --> 00:04:00.729 
that I can kill him next turn and I get

00:04:00.729 --> 00:04:02.460 
that I can kill him next turn and I get
the<00:04:00.819> parallax<00:04:01.299> which<00:04:01.629> was<00:04:01.989> irrelevant

00:04:02.460 --> 00:04:02.470 
the parallax which was irrelevant

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:04.619 
the parallax which was irrelevant
because<00:04:03.000> next<00:04:04.000> door<00:04:04.120> I'm<00:04:04.239> just<00:04:04.449> going<00:04:04.599> to

00:04:04.619 --> 00:04:04.629

finish him off of the with a thunderbolt
ice<00:04:07.750> beam<00:04:07.959> does<00:04:08.139> a<00:04:08.169> lot<00:04:08.560> but<00:04:08.889> I<00:04:08.949> believe<00:04:09.430> this

00:04:09.689 --> 00:04:09.699 
ice beam does a lot but I believe this

00:04:09.699 --> 00:04:13.199 
ice beam does a lot but I believe this
is<00:04:09.909> his<00:04:10.829> probably<00:04:11.829> this<00:04:12.340> is<00:04:12.400> his<00:04:12.699> second<00:04:13.120> to

00:04:13.199 --> 00:04:13.209 
is his probably this is his second to

00:04:13.209 --> 00:04:15.929 
is his probably this is his second to
lost<00:04:13.449> I'm<00:04:13.750> not<00:04:13.989> sure<00:04:14.049> though<00:04:14.470> but<00:04:14.709> um<00:04:14.859> I<00:04:15.099> think

00:04:15.929 --> 00:04:15.939 
lost I'm not sure though but um I think

00:04:15.939 --> 00:04:19.349 
lost I'm not sure though but um I think
so<00:04:16.329> so<00:04:16.889> yeah<00:04:17.889> he<00:04:18.070> wasn't<00:04:18.159> dance<00:04:18.489> Altaria<00:04:19.209> now
