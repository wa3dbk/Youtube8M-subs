00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:19.790 
one anymore
I<00:00:17.130> think<00:00:17.520> it's<00:00:17.640> called<00:00:17.789> taupe<00:00:18.060> now<00:00:18.449> but<00:00:18.810> that's

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:19.800 
I think it's called taupe now but that's

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:21.980 
I think it's called taupe now but that's
blonde<00:00:20.520> and<00:00:21.000> then<00:00:21.150> I<00:00:21.210> just<00:00:21.359> use<00:00:21.480> it<00:00:21.630> with<00:00:21.750> a

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:21.990 
blonde and then I just use it with a

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:26.029 
blonde and then I just use it with a
angled<00:00:22.830> brush<00:00:23.279> like<00:00:23.310> this<00:00:23.789> one<00:00:24.650> thing<00:00:25.650> I<00:00:25.800> will

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:26.039 
angled brush like this one thing I will

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:29.630 
angled brush like this one thing I will
say<00:00:26.070> is<00:00:26.609> that<00:00:27.000> it<00:00:27.240> does<00:00:27.510> dry<00:00:27.840> out<00:00:27.980> sometimes<00:00:28.980> so

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:29.640 
say is that it does dry out sometimes so

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:31.790 
say is that it does dry out sometimes so
I<00:00:29.670> just<00:00:30.330> turn<00:00:30.510> to<00:00:30.630> swirl<00:00:30.840> my<00:00:30.960> brush<00:00:31.170> around<00:00:31.380> and

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:31.800 
I just turn to swirl my brush around and

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:33.889 
I just turn to swirl my brush around and
then<00:00:31.949> I<00:00:32.160> just<00:00:32.460> roll<00:00:32.700> it<00:00:32.850> off<00:00:33.059> onto<00:00:33.420> the<00:00:33.690> cap

00:00:33.889 --> 00:00:33.899 
then I just roll it off onto the cap

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:36.110 
then I just roll it off onto the cap
just<00:00:34.860> to<00:00:35.010> make<00:00:35.130> sure<00:00:35.280> that<00:00:35.520> there<00:00:35.700> isn't<00:00:35.850> a

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:36.120 
just to make sure that there isn't a

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:37.970 
just to make sure that there isn't a
huge<00:00:36.540> amount<00:00:36.660> of<00:00:36.870> excess<00:00:37.230> that's<00:00:37.290> going<00:00:37.800> onto

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:37.980 
huge amount of excess that's going onto

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:42.170

you're not as adventurous and don't want
to<00:00:54.690> try<00:00:54.809> the<00:00:54.870> dip<00:00:55.350> brow<00:00:55.530> pomade<00:00:55.559> you<00:00:56.280> can

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
to try the dip brow pomade you can

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:58.430 
to try the dip brow pomade you can
always<00:00:56.550> try<00:00:56.820> the<00:00:56.850> brows<00:00:57.149> which<00:00:57.600> I<00:00:57.750> actually

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
always try the brows which I actually

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:05.539 
always try the brows which I actually
also<00:00:59.070> really<00:00:59.609> enjoy<00:01:03.650> so<00:01:04.650> as<00:01:04.799> you<00:01:04.949> can<00:01:05.040> see<00:01:05.280> my

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549 
also really enjoy so as you can see my

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:07.789 
also really enjoy so as you can see my
brows<00:01:05.909> are<00:01:06.090> very<00:01:06.330> sparse<00:01:06.780> at<00:01:06.960> the<00:01:07.080> front<00:01:07.470> and

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
brows are very sparse at the front and

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:09.469 
brows are very sparse at the front and
then<00:01:08.159> they<00:01:08.340> get<00:01:08.700> a<00:01:08.760> little<00:01:08.820> bit<00:01:09.090> thicker<00:01:09.119> at

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
then they get a little bit thicker at

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:13.100 
then they get a little bit thicker at
the<00:01:09.570> tail<00:01:09.780> end<00:01:10.580> and<00:01:11.580> first<00:01:12.060> I<00:01:12.270> like<00:01:12.450> to<00:01:12.689> start

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
the tail end and first I like to start

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:19.539 
the tail end and first I like to start
out<00:01:13.380> by<00:01:13.580> lining<00:01:14.580> underneath<00:01:14.850> my<00:01:15.240> brow<00:01:15.450> I

00:01:19.539 --> 00:01:19.549 

00:01:19.549 --> 00:01:24.260 

create<00:01:20.549> a<00:01:20.580> straight<00:01:21.030> line<00:01:21.299> underneath<00:01:23.270> and

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
create a straight line underneath and

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:26.240 
create a straight line underneath and
then<00:01:24.689> I<00:01:24.780> go<00:01:24.930> all<00:01:25.200> the<00:01:25.229> way<00:01:25.409> under<00:01:25.650> and<00:01:25.979> follow

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
then I go all the way under and follow

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:31.760 
then I go all the way under and follow
along

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:33.950 

and<00:01:32.220> then<00:01:32.490> I<00:01:32.579> create<00:01:32.880> the<00:01:33.030> tail<00:01:33.240> at<00:01:33.450> the<00:01:33.479> end<00:01:33.600> so

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960 
and then I create the tail at the end so

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:36.770 
and then I create the tail at the end so
I've<00:01:34.259> done<00:01:34.500> this<00:01:35.040> fall<00:01:35.460> line<00:01:36.000> and<00:01:36.299> connait<00:01:36.600> and

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
I've done this fall line and connait and

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:40.280 
I've done this fall line and connait and
created<00:01:37.290> the<00:01:37.409> tail<00:01:37.619> on<00:01:37.829> the<00:01:37.860> end<00:01:38.189> of<00:01:38.430> this<00:01:39.290> then

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:40.290 
created the tail on the end of this then

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:44.179 
created the tail on the end of this then
I<00:01:40.380> go<00:01:40.500> back<00:01:40.530> in<00:01:40.920> and<00:01:41.909> I<00:01:42.840> take<00:01:43.110> a<00:01:43.380> line<00:01:43.799> on<00:01:44.070> the

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:44.189 
I go back in and I take a line on the

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:50.420 
I go back in and I take a line on the
top

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:50.430 

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:53.370 

then<00:01:51.430> I<00:01:51.549> stopped<00:01:52.000> right<00:01:52.390> before<00:01:52.719> it<00:01:52.840> gets<00:01:53.049> to

00:01:53.370 --> 00:01:53.380 
then I stopped right before it gets to

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:58.529 
then I stopped right before it gets to
my<00:01:53.619> arch<00:01:53.860> and<00:01:54.399> I<00:01:54.969> turn<00:01:55.240> my<00:01:55.420> brush<00:01:55.630> sideways<00:01:57.539> and

00:01:58.529 --> 00:01:58.539 
my arch and I turn my brush sideways and

00:01:58.539 --> 00:02:09.499 
my arch and I turn my brush sideways and
I<00:02:00.030> slowly<00:02:01.030> create<00:02:01.780> my<00:02:02.020> arch

00:02:09.499 --> 00:02:09.509 

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:12.290 

so<00:02:10.110> what<00:02:10.259> I've<00:02:10.349> done<00:02:10.560> is<00:02:10.860> I<00:02:10.890> started<00:02:11.730> here<00:02:12.120> and

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:12.300 
so what I've done is I started here and

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:15.949 
so what I've done is I started here and
I<00:02:12.540> went<00:02:12.690> straight<00:02:12.900> I<00:02:13.470> stopped<00:02:14.459> here<00:02:14.879> turn<00:02:15.720> my

00:02:15.949 --> 00:02:15.959 
I went straight I stopped here turn my

00:02:15.959 --> 00:02:18.080 
I went straight I stopped here turn my
brush<00:02:16.230> like<00:02:16.470> this<00:02:16.709> and<00:02:17.010> then<00:02:17.400> I<00:02:17.430> created<00:02:17.879> my

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:18.090 
brush like this and then I created my

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:25.430 
brush like this and then I created my
arch<00:02:18.330> slowly<00:02:19.260> by<00:02:19.590> going<00:02:19.860> like<00:02:20.069> this<00:02:24.290> see<00:02:25.290> the

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:25.440 
arch slowly by going like this see the

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:31.190 
arch slowly by going like this see the
difference

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:31.200 

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:34.140 

here<00:02:32.200> there's<00:02:32.500> an<00:02:32.650> arch<00:02:32.890> which<00:02:33.730> I<00:02:33.850> have<00:02:34.030> to

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:34.150 
here there's an arch which I have to

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:35.850 
here there's an arch which I have to
make<00:02:34.300> because<00:02:34.390> I<00:02:34.570> don't<00:02:34.720> have<00:02:34.810> one<00:02:35.050> and<00:02:35.290> here

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:35.860 
make because I don't have one and here

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:38.910 
make because I don't have one and here
this<00:02:36.070> is<00:02:36.340> just<00:02:36.520> my<00:02:36.700> normal<00:02:36.760> brow<00:02:37.620> so<00:02:38.620> once<00:02:38.800> that

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:38.920

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:54.010 
flicking in motions to mimic hair you

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:55.800 
flicking in motions to mimic hair you
don't<00:02:54.190> want<00:02:54.370> to<00:02:54.430> just<00:02:54.640> take<00:02:54.820> your<00:02:55.030> brush<00:02:55.450> and

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:55.810 
don't want to just take your brush and

don't want to just take your brush and
draw<00:02:56.110> a<00:02:56.410> thick<00:02:56.800> line<00:02:56.830> and<00:02:57.400> just<00:02:57.820> start<00:02:58.060> filling

00:02:58.290 --> 00:02:58.300 
draw a thick line and just start filling

00:02:58.300 --> 00:02:59.700 
draw a thick line and just start filling
it<00:02:58.510> in<00:02:58.660> like<00:02:58.810> this<00:02:58.930> because<00:02:59.290> then<00:02:59.470> it<00:02:59.560> looks

00:02:59.700 --> 00:02:59.710 
it in like this because then it looks

00:02:59.710 --> 00:03:02.430 
it in like this because then it looks
very<00:02:59.890> boxy<00:03:00.550> and<00:03:00.790> unnatural<00:03:01.510> you<00:03:01.960> want<00:03:02.170> to<00:03:02.260> try

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:02.440 
very boxy and unnatural you want to try

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:05.010 
very boxy and unnatural you want to try
to<00:03:02.500> mimic<00:03:02.970> hairs<00:03:03.970> and<00:03:04.210> it's<00:03:04.360> very<00:03:04.540> easy<00:03:04.720> to<00:03:04.900> do

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:05.020 
to mimic hairs and it's very easy to do

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:08.460 
to mimic hairs and it's very easy to do
this<00:03:05.140> just<00:03:05.320> by<00:03:05.440> flicking<00:03:05.860> like<00:03:06.160> this<00:03:07.470> then

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:08.470 
this just by flicking like this then

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:10.050 
this just by flicking like this then
when<00:03:08.620> you<00:03:08.709> come<00:03:08.890> to<00:03:09.010> the<00:03:09.130> tail<00:03:09.310> don't<00:03:09.610> flick

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:10.060 
when you come to the tail don't flick

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:12.540 
when you come to the tail don't flick
because<00:03:10.420> it<00:03:10.540> will<00:03:10.630> make<00:03:11.080> your<00:03:11.140> tail<00:03:11.440> fatter<00:03:11.860> so

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:12.550 
because it will make your tail fatter so

because it will make your tail fatter so
I<00:03:12.580> just<00:03:12.850> like<00:03:13.000> to<00:03:13.120> stop<00:03:13.390> almost<00:03:13.690> at<00:03:13.930> the<00:03:14.050> tail

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:14.230 
I just like to stop almost at the tail

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:19.240 
and just nicely graze it once all of

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:21.750 
and just nicely graze it once all of
that<00:03:19.420> is<00:03:19.690> done<00:03:20.200> and<00:03:20.410> that<00:03:20.560> part<00:03:20.860> is<00:03:20.980> all<00:03:21.190> filled

00:03:42.990 --> 00:03:43.000 
but I prefer not to do a very boxy shape

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.270 
but I prefer not to do a very boxy shape
I<00:03:43.480> like<00:03:43.989> having<00:03:44.380> a<00:03:44.500> little<00:03:44.650> bit<00:03:44.830> of<00:03:44.920> a<00:03:45.010> fade<00:03:45.250> on

00:03:45.270 --> 00:03:45.280 
I like having a little bit of a fade on

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:47.970 
I like having a little bit of a fade on
the<00:03:45.550> front<00:03:45.790> and<00:03:46.000> then<00:03:46.150> the<00:03:46.330> arch<00:03:46.540> I<00:03:46.870> do<00:03:47.410> like<00:03:47.800> a

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:47.980 
the front and then the arch I do like a

00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:49.440 
the front and then the arch I do like a
squared<00:03:48.370> off<00:03:48.580> look<00:03:48.850> so<00:03:49.000> if<00:03:49.090> you<00:03:49.120> don't<00:03:49.330> like

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:49.450 
squared off look so if you don't like

00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:50.910 
squared off look so if you don't like
that<00:03:49.570> that's<00:03:49.720> fine<00:03:50.050> you<00:03:50.350> don't<00:03:50.410> have<00:03:50.560> to<00:03:50.739> mimic

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:50.920 
that that's fine you don't have to mimic

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:53.520 
that that's fine you don't have to mimic
this<00:03:51.160> video<00:03:51.780> but<00:03:52.780> to<00:03:52.930> create<00:03:53.110> this<00:03:53.320> square<00:03:53.500> I

00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:53.530 
this video but to create this square I

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:55.080 
this video but to create this square I
do<00:03:53.739> small<00:03:54.430> flicks

00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:55.090 
do small flicks

00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:57.270 
do small flicks
I<00:03:55.150> don't<00:03:55.450> box<00:03:56.230> it<00:03:56.440> in<00:03:56.620> and<00:03:56.769> then<00:03:56.860> fill<00:03:57.100> it<00:03:57.220> in

00:03:57.270 --> 00:03:57.280 
I don't box it in and then fill it in

00:03:57.280 --> 00:03:59.850 
I don't box it in and then fill it in
because<00:03:57.580> I<00:03:57.670> it<00:03:58.060> tends<00:03:58.330> to<00:03:58.450> look<00:03:58.720> very<00:03:58.930> squared

00:03:59.850 --> 00:03:59.860 
because I it tends to look very squared

00:03:59.860 --> 00:04:01.650 
because I it tends to look very squared
and<00:04:00.160> box<00:04:00.459> if<00:04:00.730> you<00:04:00.850> do<00:04:01.000> that<00:04:01.150> if<00:04:01.330> you<00:04:01.480> just

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:01.660 
and box if you do that if you just

00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:04.440 
and box if you do that if you just
lightly<00:04:02.019> flick<00:04:02.560> it<00:04:03.400> will<00:04:03.550> create<00:04:03.790> a<00:04:03.850> natural

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:04.450 
lightly flick it will create a natural

00:04:04.450 --> 00:04:06.270 
lightly flick it will create a natural
square<00:04:04.780> that's<00:04:04.959> very<00:04:05.200> flattering<00:04:05.739> in<00:04:06.040> my

00:04:06.270 --> 00:04:06.280 
square that's very flattering in my

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:10.110 
square that's very flattering in my
opinion<00:04:07.650> also<00:04:08.650> just<00:04:09.010> be<00:04:09.130> careful<00:04:09.489> that<00:04:10.000> you're

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:10.120 
opinion also just be careful that you're

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:13.320 
opinion also just be careful that you're
not<00:04:10.269> going<00:04:10.480> too<00:04:10.810> far<00:04:11.140> over<00:04:11.410> or<00:04:11.830> it<00:04:12.610> can<00:04:13.030> end<00:04:13.060> up

00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:13.330 
not going too far over or it can end up

00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:15.330 
not going too far over or it can end up
looking<00:04:13.959> a<00:04:14.050> little<00:04:14.170> bit<00:04:14.410> too<00:04:14.590> close<00:04:14.920> also

00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:15.340 
looking a little bit too close also

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:17.610 
looking a little bit too close also
smooth<00:04:15.940> though<00:04:16.090> with<00:04:16.510> plucking<00:04:17.350> you<00:04:17.470> don't

00:04:17.610 --> 00:04:17.620 
smooth though with plucking you don't

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:20.759 
smooth though with plucking you don't
want<00:04:17.769> to<00:04:17.830> go<00:04:17.950> too<00:04:18.010> far<00:04:18.669> as<00:04:19.000> well<00:04:19.560> the<00:04:20.560> normal

00:04:20.759 --> 00:04:20.769 
want to go too far as well the normal

00:04:20.769 --> 00:04:22.770 
want to go too far as well the normal
recommendation<00:04:21.489> is<00:04:21.640> that<00:04:21.669> it<00:04:21.940> just<00:04:22.180> almost

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:22.780 
recommendation is that it just almost

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:24.780 
recommendation is that it just almost
the<00:04:23.050> same<00:04:23.320> as<00:04:23.620> the<00:04:23.740> bridge<00:04:23.919> of<00:04:24.070> your<00:04:24.100> nose<00:04:24.220> if

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:24.790 
the same as the bridge of your nose if

00:04:24.790 --> 00:04:26.610 
the same as the bridge of your nose if
you<00:04:24.910> do<00:04:25.180> have<00:04:25.390> a<00:04:25.419> little<00:04:25.600> bit<00:04:25.720> of<00:04:25.870> wider<00:04:26.200> bridge

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:26.620 
you do have a little bit of wider bridge

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:28.500 
you do have a little bit of wider bridge
then<00:04:27.250> maybe<00:04:27.460> don't<00:04:27.700> mimic<00:04:27.910> because<00:04:28.360> your

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:28.510 
then maybe don't mimic because your

00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:30.690 
then maybe don't mimic because your
eyebrows<00:04:28.810> will<00:04:29.050> be<00:04:29.229> too<00:04:29.410> far<00:04:29.620> apart<00:04:29.770> and<00:04:30.190> if

00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:30.700 
eyebrows will be too far apart and if

00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:33.210 
eyebrows will be too far apart and if
your<00:04:30.850> bridge<00:04:31.060> is<00:04:31.300> small<00:04:31.570> just<00:04:32.260> go<00:04:32.830> with<00:04:33.010> what

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:33.220 
your bridge is small just go with what

00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:35.219
