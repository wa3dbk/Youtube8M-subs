00:00:54.919 --> 00:00:54.929 
so the first thing Heather's going to do

00:00:54.929 --> 00:00:56.479 
so the first thing Heather's going to do
is<00:00:55.170> she's<00:00:55.350> basically<00:00:55.589> going<00:00:56.039> to<00:00:56.100> sort<00:00:56.280> of<00:00:56.309> put

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
is she's basically going to sort of put

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:59.299 
is she's basically going to sort of put
her<00:00:56.609> belly<00:00:56.879> up<00:00:57.210> to<00:00:57.269> the<00:00:57.690> ball<00:00:57.899> good<00:00:58.649> and<00:00:58.949> she's

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
her belly up to the ball good and she's

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:01.759 
her belly up to the ball good and she's
gonna<00:00:59.429> lean<00:00:59.819> forward<00:01:00.359> onto<00:01:00.600> the<00:01:00.899> ball<00:01:01.109> and<00:01:01.710> I
