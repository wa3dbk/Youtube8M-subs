absolute chaos and the containers help

00:03:32.609 --> 00:03:35.000 
absolute chaos and the containers help
keep<00:03:33.030> things<00:03:33.239> grouped<00:03:33.810> together<00:03:34.019> and<00:03:34.590> in

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:35.010 
keep things grouped together and in

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:37.099 
keep things grouped together and in
place<00:03:35.370> so<00:03:36.150> they're<00:03:36.299> not<00:03:36.449> just<00:03:36.599> falling<00:03:37.019> all

00:03:37.099 --> 00:03:37.109 
place so they're not just falling all

00:03:37.109 --> 00:03:40.929 
place so they're not just falling all
over<00:03:37.139> the<00:03:37.470> place<00:03:38.000> so<00:03:39.000> these<00:03:39.780> containers<00:03:40.199> are

00:03:40.929 --> 00:03:40.939 
over the place so these containers are

00:03:40.939 --> 00:03:44.899 
over the place so these containers are
there<00:03:41.939> from<00:03:42.359> target<00:03:43.370> like<00:03:44.370> I<00:03:44.549> just<00:03:44.609> thought

00:03:44.899 --> 00:03:44.909 
there from target like I just thought

00:03:44.909 --> 00:03:46.759
