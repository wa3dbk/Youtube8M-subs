00:00:08.569 --> 00:00:13.500
 last part we discussed strategy we talked about colors 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:16.029
 we have treated the parts of a card 

00:00:16.029 --> 00:00:20.730
 Now we will show you the various types of cards that exist in megic starting 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:22.970
 from the most common card of all 

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:24.589
 the third 

00:00:24.589 --> 00:00:28.320
 the reason why the earth is really common 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:33.289
 and that you will have to use the lands to play all the other cards it has 

00:00:33.289 --> 00:00:34.489
 you can play 

00:00:34.489 --> 00:00:37.220
 one track per shift 

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:38.769
 the game longer 

00:00:38.769 --> 00:00:42.599
 the more spells you will be able to play the more numerous and effective 

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:44.280
 now 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:48.699
 let's see some of the spells you can play in the game first of all 

00:00:48.699 --> 00:00:51.650
 oleeeee shows us a sorcery 

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:52.840
 sorcery 

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:55.020
 take only once 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:56.240
 you will play it 

00:00:56.240 --> 00:01:00.839
 you will get a useful benefit on your turn and then end up in your graveyard 

00:01:00.839 --> 00:01:02.890
 chelated discard pile 

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:06.980
 even more interesting than a sorcery is the snapshot 

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:11.060
 the snapshot resembles witchcraft 

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:12.490
 you pay the cost 

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:15.910
 do what the card says and then the scart 

00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:20.950
 in the very special act of an instant and then play it in 

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:22.450
 any time 

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:24.490
 then play it in your turn 

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:27.540
 or even play it in the turn of the salary hill 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:32.470
 when you play it you play it not as flexible but anyway 

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:35.470
 spells are always interesting 

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:40.280
 spell is a kind of witchcraft or even instantaneous 

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:43.280
 but the effect of the spell is permanent 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:48.730
 unlike sorceries and he instantaneous who go to the cemetery do not 

00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:50.400
 as soon as they are solved 

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:52.720
 spells remain in play 

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:56.540
 and continue to give you their effect until the collapse decides to 

00:01:56.540 --> 00:01:58.210
 destroy them 

00:01:58.210 --> 00:01:59.900
 something still left 

00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:01.900
 artifact cards 

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:07.650
 artifacts in me geeks represent the legendary and wonderful objects in yours 

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:08.599
 possession 

00:02:08.599 --> 00:02:10.849
 I stay in the game when you play them 

00:02:10.849 --> 00:02:14.400
 and they have some interesting aspects just like spells 

00:02:15.669 --> 00:02:18.209
 unlike spells 

00:02:18.209 --> 00:02:21.599
 you can see that they are in colors 

00:02:21.599 --> 00:02:24.619
 the cards we show you now are blue 

00:02:24.619 --> 00:02:27.879
 while each artifact has no color 

00:02:28.399 --> 00:02:33.309
 this means that the artifact can be inserted into any kind of mad 

00:02:33.309 --> 00:02:33.830
 olbia 

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:35.649
 you can put it in your blue deck 

00:02:35.649 --> 00:02:39.099
 you can put it in your black deck or any other March 

00:02:39.749 --> 00:02:42.749
 the last card we will talk about today is the creature 

00:02:43.379 --> 00:02:47.499
 creatures are among the game's main cards 

00:02:47.499 --> 00:02:50.279
 square footage will go to form your armies 

00:02:50.279 --> 00:02:54.089
 and it will be thanks to them that you will win most of your parts 

00:02:55.959 --> 00:03:00.660
 you can easily locate a creature card because it is the only type of card 

00:03:01.169 --> 00:03:04.619
 which has two numbers in the lower right corner 

00:03:04.619 --> 00:03:07.159
 these two numbers are strength 

00:03:07.159 --> 00:03:09.039
 and the constitution 

00:03:09.039 --> 00:03:11.839
 now that we have the necessary ingredients 

00:03:11.839 --> 00:03:15.429
 let karol eoline show us some magic 

00:03:16.149 --> 00:03:18.869
 let's imagine we are in the middle of a game 

00:03:18.869 --> 00:03:20.779
 with seven frames in play 

00:03:20.779 --> 00:03:24.029
 we played a land every turn until now 

00:03:24.029 --> 00:03:28.109
 so we have the chance to make a lot of different moves 

00:03:28.939 --> 00:03:32.389
 now we'll show you the cards that olive trees are holding 

00:03:33.049 --> 00:03:34.269
 usually 

00:03:34.269 --> 00:03:36.329
 you won't put your hand like that 

00:03:36.329 --> 00:03:39.449
 otherwise your opponent will be able to see it 

00:03:39.449 --> 00:03:41.449
 it's a wrong strategy 

00:03:41.449 --> 00:03:44.159
 but today it's good we are here to learn 

00:03:44.159 --> 00:03:47.369
 then we begin to put something into play 

00:03:47.369 --> 00:03:49.570
 the way to put the cards in play 

00:03:49.570 --> 00:03:51.560
 and that of drawing power 

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:52.629
 than in megic 

00:03:52.629 --> 00:03:54.019
 it's called ma 

00:03:54.019 --> 00:03:56.469
 the power keeps it from the land 

00:03:56.469 --> 00:04:00.339
 ebay thanks to this power that you can play all the other cards 

00:04:01.589 --> 00:04:05.159
 as we show if we are using the power of these lands 

00:04:06.019 --> 00:04:07.959
 you will have to plug them 

00:04:07.959 --> 00:04:09.969
 to plug something 

00:04:09.969 --> 00:04:13.279
 you have to rotate it 90 degrees 

00:04:13.279 --> 00:04:19.159
 when you rotate something of 90 kb it means you used that card for 

00:04:19.159 --> 00:04:20.129
 culture 

00:04:20.129 --> 00:04:23.129
 and you can't use it until your next turn 

00:04:23.659 --> 00:04:26.659
 now let's see what olive trees will play in termoli 

00:04:27.199 --> 00:04:28.889
 what do you think of genius 

00:04:28.889 --> 00:04:30.760
 really a powerful creature 

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:33.969
 let's take a look at it in the upper right corner 

00:04:33.969 --> 00:04:35.680
 you can see its cost 

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:36.780
 a 4 

00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:39.199
 and then two single mambro 

00:04:39.199 --> 00:04:45.400
 this means because to play that creature you need 2 blue e4 mana 

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:47.080
 mana of any color 

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:50.080
 so o - for us if it remains intact 

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:52.849
 we understand semana 

00:04:52.849 --> 00:04:55.529
 and put the genius or shock 

00:04:55.529 --> 00:04:59.279
 your opponent 'now shivered was definitely fearful 

00:05:00.099 --> 00:05:03.120
 there is still a third so we have several choices 

00:05:04.909 --> 00:05:09.610
 we played a great creature so we can play another left-handed 

00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:11.770
 or pass the turn 

00:05:11.770 --> 00:05:15.370
 we have not finished yet we have this olivia section tapped 

00:05:16.069 --> 00:05:19.330
 and let's play a conjuring trick 

00:05:19.330 --> 00:05:22.249
 conjuring is a sorcery 

00:05:22.249 --> 00:05:25.539
 after playing this sorcery your discarded 

00:05:26.210 --> 00:05:30.789
 we will get his little useful effect and then we will put it in the graveyard 

00:05:30.789 --> 00:05:32.930
 waste stack 

00:05:32.930 --> 00:05:36.249
 and don't worry about plugging all your boobs 

00:05:36.770 --> 00:05:41.559
 because at the beginning of each round all the cards in play are stopped 

00:05:41.559 --> 00:05:45.520
 so you will have the opportunity to use all these cards you have again 

00:05:45.519 --> 00:05:47.870
 tapped the first round 

00:05:47.870 --> 00:05:51.530
 we learned the basics to start a game 

00:05:51.530 --> 00:05:56.110
 so let's start in the next part we'll try something different e 

00:05:56.110 --> 00:05:59.110
 we'll launch some magic 

00:06:02.789 --> 00:06:03.789
 flight
