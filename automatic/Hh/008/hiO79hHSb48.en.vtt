 the premises illegally 

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:04.360
 looking to life 

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:09.820
 it is not the will of the people to prostrate you and 

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:11.290
 When there is no legal document there is no 

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:13.840
 support for the actions that are 

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:16.000
 carrying forward that the expansion of 

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:17.350
 the one on this section of the highway has 

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.260
 what to do with two very important things 

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:22.150
 one the transport of goods the 

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:24.490
 possibility that the trailers of 

00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:26.470
 double semi-trailer with exceeded weight 

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:28.210
 that is very important to them because 

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:30.910
 he has to be trafficking with many 

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:33.729
 many objects of change in this area 

00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:36.250
 but also in addition to diego everything 

00:01:33.729 --> 00:01:39.009
 returns in terms of toll collection not 

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:40.720
 but also for the urbanization 

00:01:39.009 --> 00:01:42.520
 by the phenomenon of urbanization that 

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:43.840
 they are to wild dynamics of 

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:46.500
 urbanization that I am implementing 

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:46.500
 here in the state of morelos 

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:54.880
 after suspending the works for a 

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:56.830
 day Tuesday starting at 10 

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:59.380
 tomorrow the machinery started to work 

00:01:56.830 --> 00:02:01.510
 which caused tension among settlers 

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:05.190
 and the elements of the secretariat of 

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:05.190
 public safety of the state 

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:15.330
 the machine is working and has to 

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:17.069
 continue to develop the development of 

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:19.560
 what they have planned here and that 

00:02:17.069 --> 00:02:23.840
 it's all you should not confront them 

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:26.819
 they should also keep their area of 

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:30.150
 no need to withdraw your staff 

00:02:26.819 --> 00:02:32.430
 we are not we are not drug addicts nor are we 

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:36.890
 delinquents so that they are taking care of us 

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:36.890
 We are defending our land 

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:41.319
 the members of the front blocked 

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:45.000
 intermittently the road and 

00:02:41.319 --> 00:02:45.000
 they took the town hall of tepoztlan 

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:02.040
 has achieved 

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:13.870
 meanwhile the Government Secretariat 

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:16.030
 of the state clarified that they will continue advancing 

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:18.100
 on the stretch of this highway because it 's 

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:20.560
 a communication path that requires 

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:24.270
 morelos and it is also intended that 

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:24.270
 this becomes a safe way 

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:39.550
 from postulate morelos with images of 

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:42.099
 miguel angel to his a paola olivares 

00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:43.989
 The communal news effect is what 

00:03:42.099 --> 00:03:46.870
 missing for opening for this project 

00:03:43.989 --> 00:03:49.630
 then it is precisely the resistance 

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:51.489
 in this camp is the up there 

00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:53.440
 they could get there and even there they go 

00:03:51.489 --> 00:03:57.480
 have to stop because by then 

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:57.480
 they would already be committing this violations
