00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.520
 so we lost a big bruno man 

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:10.230
 metsu it's true that I could not manage to 

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:12.840
 find the words for to explain this 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:15.150
 happened but I think I have 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:18.180
 he is a very good Muslim and I 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:18.810
 also understand that as soon as the beautiful say 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:21.900
 Something 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:24.850
 the person who can put himself 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:27.760
 who will be there so there is only one thing 

00:00:24.850 --> 00:00:30.370
 that I can say is that ferriÃ¨re 

00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:32.230
 when I saw what happened all 

00:00:30.370 --> 00:00:34.990
 course of his internship I was 

00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:36.070
 very proud and I believe that today we 

00:00:34.990 --> 00:00:38.350
 lost a great gentleman 

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:40.690

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:44.739
 advise we lost a brother 

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:46.570
 and above all we lost names that we 

00:00:44.739 --> 00:00:49.030
 shown that showed us the way to the 

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:51.270
 success and especially that we did 

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:53.260
 vibrate and saint bruno 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:56.260
 it's true we were very good 

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:57.340
 players but it's not about having 

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:59.560
 only very good players for 

00:00:57.340 --> 00:01:02.290
 form a football team and bruno 

00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:04.839
 we will have taught ourselves to be the 

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:07.300
 men taught us the winners 

00:01:04.839 --> 00:01:09.610
 respect our country and our country it is 

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:11.979
 what to start with victories and in 

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:15.220
 pleasing in all our strength 

00:01:11.979 --> 00:01:17.830
 so all I can say to bruno of 

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:21.550

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:23.740

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:27.580
 sick 

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:29.920
 we knew they were doomed 

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:31.390
 during this period is what you 

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:32.590
 you are talking and what are you 

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:34.030
 you are told what were the 

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:36.040
 confidences the last constancy of 

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:38.770
 bruno with you but of course it's from 

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:40.330
 talk to each other every time we have 

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:40.720
 knew he was a little bad he was 

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:42.820
 sick 

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:44.920
 we were always on the phone I 

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:46.540
 went to see him in dubai 

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:47.860
 it was all the time the phone is 

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:50.080
 spoke all the time I was taking in front 

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:51.780
 all the time even though I could if there was 

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:55.119
 at a given moment he could not speak 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:58.210
 I talked to his wife about his whole family 

00:01:55.119 --> 00:02:01.060
 and I believe that today all that 

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:03.130
 can we do the generation 2002 where 

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:04.150

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:07.049
