that<00:05:42.470> I<00:05:43.010> don't<00:05:43.550> think<00:05:43.730> he's<00:05:43.880> worth<00:05:44.090> 18k<00:05:44.990> or

00:05:45.160 --> 00:05:45.170

00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:49.250 
disappointed me so I wouldn't bother if

00:05:49.250 --> 00:05:53.470

I<00:05:49.370> was<00:05:49.520> you<00:05:50.620> okay<00:05:51.620> so<00:05:51.680> that's<00:05:52.130> that<00:05:52.490> and<00:05:52.790> just

I was you okay so that's that and just

00:05:53.480 --> 00:05:55.120 
I was you okay so that's that and just
quickly<00:05:53.600> before<00:05:53.900> I<00:05:54.080> go<00:05:54.260> let<00:05:54.290> me<00:05:54.560> know<00:05:54.680> what<00:05:55.010> you

00:05:55.120 --> 00:05:55.130 
quickly before I go let me know what you

00:05:55.130 --> 00:05:56.770

think<00:05:55.280> of<00:05:55.430> you<00:05:55.550> know<00:05:55.670> seeing<00:05:56.090> the<00:05:56.210> goals<00:05:56.450> first

00:05:56.770 --> 00:05:56.780 
think of you know seeing the goals first

00:05:56.780 --> 00:05:59.710 
think of you know seeing the goals first
and<00:05:57.200> instead<00:05:58.070> of<00:05:58.190> me<00:05:58.340> and<00:05:58.640> introducing<00:05:59.600> each

00:05:59.710 --> 00:05:59.720 
and instead of me and introducing each

00:05:59.720 --> 00:06:02.800 
and instead of me and introducing each
player<00:06:00.080> individually<00:06:00.970> I<00:06:01.970> just<00:06:02.510> think<00:06:02.660> it's

00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:02.810 
player individually I just think it's

00:06:02.810 --> 00:06:05.260 
player individually I just think it's
better<00:06:02.990> seeing<00:06:03.860> the<00:06:03.980> girls<00:06:04.220> first<00:06:04.580> it's<00:06:05.090> more

00:06:05.260 --> 00:06:05.270 
better seeing the girls first it's more

00:06:05.270 --> 00:06:08.770 
better seeing the girls first it's more
entertaining<00:06:05.510> and<00:06:06.110> then<00:06:07.210> at<00:06:08.210> the<00:06:08.420> end<00:06:08.450> I'll

00:06:08.770 --> 00:06:08.780 
entertaining and then at the end I'll

00:06:08.780 --> 00:06:11.020 
entertaining and then at the end I'll
just<00:06:08.990> give<00:06:09.200> a<00:06:09.230> summary<00:06:09.920> of<00:06:10.070> the<00:06:10.280> squad<00:06:10.700> and

00:06:11.020 --> 00:06:11.030 
just give a summary of the squad and

00:06:11.030 --> 00:06:12.790 
just give a summary of the squad and
which<00:06:11.510> players<00:06:11.810> are<00:06:12.050> liked<00:06:12.260> I<00:06:12.440> think<00:06:12.650> that's

00:06:12.790 --> 00:06:12.800 
which players are liked I think that's

00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:14.440 
which players are liked I think that's
much<00:06:12.980> better<00:06:13.190> so<00:06:13.490> let<00:06:14.000> me<00:06:14.090> know<00:06:14.210> what<00:06:14.360> you
