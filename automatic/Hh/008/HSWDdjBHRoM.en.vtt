I'm<00:00:02.159> going<00:00:02.310> to<00:00:02.370> start<00:00:02.610> rebounding<00:00:03.179> this<00:00:03.330> out

00:00:03.530 --> 00:00:03.540 
I'm going to start rebounding this out

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:06.110 
I'm going to start rebounding this out
now<00:00:03.780> in<00:00:03.990> traditional<00:00:04.590> grip<00:00:04.890> and<00:00:05.700> first<00:00:05.940> I'm

going to explain that a little bit the

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:12.430 
going to explain that a little bit the
traditional<00:00:09.660> grip<00:00:09.930> is<00:00:10.430> probably<00:00:11.430> the<00:00:11.580> older

00:00:12.430 --> 00:00:12.440 
traditional grip is probably the older

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:15.049 
traditional grip is probably the older
old-school<00:00:13.440> version<00:00:13.920> it's<00:00:14.459> what<00:00:14.699> you'd<00:00:14.850> see

00:00:15.049 --> 00:00:15.059 
old-school version it's what you'd see

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:18.290 
old-school version it's what you'd see
buddy<00:00:15.299> playing<00:00:15.949> I've<00:00:16.949> used<00:00:17.340> it<00:00:17.550> most<00:00:17.940> of<00:00:18.150> my

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:18.300 
buddy playing I've used it most of my

buddy playing I've used it most of my
career<00:00:19.370> my<00:00:20.370> father<00:00:20.640> taught<00:00:21.000> it<00:00:21.150> to<00:00:21.180> me<00:00:23.690> what's

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:24.690 
career my father taught it to me what's

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050 
gonna sit between the two bones that's

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:43.790 
gonna sit between the two bones that's
your<00:00:40.290> fulcrum<00:00:40.800> compared<00:00:41.340> to<00:00:41.780> this<00:00:42.780> side<00:00:43.050> now

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:43.800 
your fulcrum compared to this side now

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:45.740 
your fulcrum compared to this side now
we<00:00:43.860> have<00:00:44.130> this<00:00:44.310> side<00:00:44.520> so<00:00:44.790> we've<00:00:45.360> got<00:00:45.480> a<00:00:45.510> little

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750 
we have this side so we've got a little

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:47.600 
we have this side so we've got a little
wiggle<00:00:45.899> waggle<00:00:46.350> on<00:00:46.440> the<00:00:46.530> right<00:00:46.710> hand<00:00:47.010> a<00:00:47.220> little

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
wiggle waggle on the right hand a little

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:51.290 
wiggle waggle on the right hand a little
wiggle<00:00:48.000> waggle<00:00:48.450> here<00:00:49.850> so<00:00:50.850> I'm<00:00:51.000> gonna<00:00:51.090> I'm

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 
wiggle waggle here so I'm gonna I'm

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:52.520 
wiggle waggle here so I'm gonna I'm
gonna<00:00:51.360> explain<00:00:51.660> the<00:00:51.780> left<00:00:51.989> hand<00:00:52.200> a<00:00:52.260> little<00:00:52.290> bit

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
gonna explain the left hand a little bit

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:54.440 
gonna explain the left hand a little bit
then<00:00:52.739> I'll<00:00:52.860> just<00:00:53.489> briefly<00:00:53.730> talk<00:00:54.059> about<00:00:54.120> the

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:54.450 
then I'll just briefly talk about the

00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:55.729 
then I'll just briefly talk about the
right<00:00:54.630> hand<00:00:54.809> because<00:00:55.079> it's<00:00:55.230> just<00:00:55.350> a<00:00:55.440> slight

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739 
right hand because it's just a slight

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:58.250 
right hand because it's just a slight
adjustment<00:00:56.329> first<00:00:57.329> we<00:00:57.510> have<00:00:57.630> to<00:00:57.780> we<00:00:58.020> have<00:00:58.050> to

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
adjustment first we have to we have to

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:01.130 
adjustment first we have to we have to
find<00:00:58.290> the<00:00:58.680> fulcrum<00:00:59.100> of<00:00:59.969> the<00:01:00.149> stick<00:01:00.480> where<00:01:01.050> it

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
find the fulcrum of the stick where it

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:04.850 
find the fulcrum of the stick where it
bounces<00:01:01.290> the<00:01:01.739> most<00:01:02.120> and<00:01:03.500> that's<00:01:04.500> pretty

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
bounces the most and that's pretty

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:06.739 
bounces the most and that's pretty
simple<00:01:05.159> what<00:01:05.819> you're<00:01:05.969> gonna<00:01:06.060> do<00:01:06.299> is<00:01:06.479> you're

00:01:06.739 --> 00:01:06.749 
simple what you're gonna do is you're

00:01:06.749 --> 00:01:10.459 
simple what you're gonna do is you're
going<00:01:06.929> to<00:01:07.049> try<00:01:07.319> to<00:01:07.999> hold<00:01:08.999> the<00:01:09.179> stick<00:01:09.450> about<00:01:09.810> 3/4

00:01:10.459 --> 00:01:10.469 
going to try to hold the stick about 3/4

00:01:10.469 --> 00:01:13.370 
going to try to hold the stick about 3/4
of<00:01:10.499> the<00:01:10.679> way<00:01:10.829> down<00:01:11.100> and<00:01:12.079> you're<00:01:13.079> going<00:01:13.200> to<00:01:13.229> see

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
of the way down and you're going to see

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:14.959 
of the way down and you're going to see
how<00:01:13.469> much<00:01:13.619> bounce<00:01:13.950> you<00:01:14.429> get<00:01:14.639> out<00:01:14.819> of<00:01:14.850> that

00:01:14.959 --> 00:01:14.969 
how much bounce you get out of that

00:01:14.969 --> 00:01:16.879 
how much bounce you get out of that
stick<00:01:15.299> you'll<00:01:15.780> notice<00:01:16.109> if<00:01:16.259> you<00:01:16.350> hold<00:01:16.560> it<00:01:16.679> back

00:01:16.879 --> 00:01:16.889 
stick you'll notice if you hold it back

00:01:16.889 --> 00:01:20.179 
stick you'll notice if you hold it back
too<00:01:17.279> far<00:01:18.289> it's<00:01:19.289> not<00:01:19.439> going<00:01:19.619> to<00:01:19.679> balance<00:01:19.859> much

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:20.189 
too far it's not going to balance much

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:22.399 
too far it's not going to balance much
and<00:01:20.459> by<00:01:20.670> the<00:01:20.729> way<00:01:20.939> when<00:01:21.659> you<00:01:21.840> go<00:01:21.990> through<00:01:22.229> the

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409 
and by the way when you go through the

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:24.980 
and by the way when you go through the
book<00:01:22.909> traditional<00:01:23.909> non<00:01:24.299> bounce<00:01:24.630> you're<00:01:24.869> going

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990 
book traditional non bounce you're going

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:26.539 
book traditional non bounce you're going
to<00:01:25.079> hold<00:01:25.200> it<00:01:25.289> back<00:01:25.499> further<00:01:25.920> just<00:01:26.279> like<00:01:26.429> you

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:26.549 
to hold it back further just like you

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:29.929 
to hold it back further just like you
did<00:01:26.759> with<00:01:27.389> with<00:01:27.749> the<00:01:27.959> match<00:01:28.740> grip<00:01:29.100> so<00:01:29.789> you'll

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:29.939 
did with with the match grip so you'll

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:31.690 
did with with the match grip so you'll
have<00:01:30.119> more<00:01:30.420> weight<00:01:30.689> at<00:01:30.929> the<00:01:30.990> end<00:01:31.170> of<00:01:31.259> the<00:01:31.349> stick

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:31.700 
have more weight at the end of the stick

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:34.609 
have more weight at the end of the stick
but<00:01:32.700> now<00:01:32.969> we're<00:01:33.149> balancing<00:01:33.659> so<00:01:33.959> we're<00:01:34.529> gonna

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:34.619 
but now we're balancing so we're gonna

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:37.190 
but now we're balancing so we're gonna
take<00:01:34.920> the<00:01:35.069> actual<00:01:35.369> fulcrum<00:01:35.909> point<00:01:35.939> the<00:01:36.749> bouncy

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
take the actual fulcrum point the bouncy

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:41.169 
take the actual fulcrum point the bouncy
part<00:01:37.729> and<00:01:38.729> let<00:01:39.630> the<00:01:39.749> stick<00:01:40.020> do<00:01:40.170> all<00:01:40.349> the<00:01:40.499> work

00:01:41.169 --> 00:01:41.179 
part and let the stick do all the work

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:44.599 
part and let the stick do all the work
okay<00:01:42.179> so<00:01:42.389> you're<00:01:43.349> gonna<00:01:43.439> find<00:01:44.159> that<00:01:44.399> if<00:01:44.520> you

00:01:44.599 --> 00:01:44.609 
okay so you're gonna find that if you

00:01:44.609 --> 00:01:48.760 
okay so you're gonna find that if you
hold<00:01:44.759> it<00:01:44.909> too<00:01:45.060> far<00:01:45.359> up<00:01:46.459> it's<00:01:47.459> not<00:01:47.579> gonna<00:01:47.700> bounce

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:48.770 
hold it too far up it's not gonna bounce

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:51.169 
hold it too far up it's not gonna bounce
so<00:01:49.770> you're<00:01:49.889> gonna<00:01:49.979> find<00:01:50.219> that<00:01:50.369> magical<00:01:50.849> spot

00:01:51.169 --> 00:01:51.179 
so you're gonna find that magical spot

00:01:51.179 --> 00:01:53.239 
so you're gonna find that magical spot
also<00:01:51.840> with<00:01:52.109> the<00:01:52.499> traditional<00:01:52.919> grip<00:01:53.069> you'll

00:01:53.239 --> 00:01:53.249 
also with the traditional grip you'll

00:01:53.249 --> 00:01:56.120 
also with the traditional grip you'll
notice<00:01:53.579> that<00:01:53.789> I'm<00:01:53.939> I'm<00:01:54.450> really<00:01:55.200> holding<00:01:55.859> that

notice that I'm I'm really holding that

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:59.629 
notice that I'm I'm really holding that
hand<00:01:57.060> kind<00:01:58.049> of<00:01:58.079> below<00:01:58.499> the<00:01:58.859> level<00:01:59.130> of<00:01:59.219> the<00:01:59.340> drum

00:01:59.629 --> 00:01:59.639 
hand kind of below the level of the drum

00:01:59.639 --> 00:02:04.999 
hand kind of below the level of the drum
or<00:02:00.239> the<00:02:00.329> drum<00:02:00.599> pad<00:02:00.889> as<00:02:03.560> compared<00:02:04.560> to<00:02:04.619> the<00:02:04.829> right

00:02:04.999 --> 00:02:05.009 
or the drum pad as compared to the right

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:07.969 
or the drum pad as compared to the right
hand<00:02:05.340> you're<00:02:06.179> kind<00:02:06.689> of<00:02:06.810> over<00:02:07.319> that<00:02:07.709> situation

the rim
that's<00:02:29.820> your<00:02:30.030> optimal<00:02:30.480> bounce<00:02:30.900> so<00:02:31.500> you<00:02:31.560> can

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:31.710

now<00:04:11.160> when<00:04:11.310> I<00:04:11.370> bounce<00:04:12.709> my<00:04:13.709> whole<00:04:13.920> wrist<00:04:14.250> is

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:14.550 
now when I bounce my whole wrist is

00:04:14.550 --> 00:04:17.870 
now when I bounce my whole wrist is
moving<00:04:14.880> with<00:04:15.000> that<00:04:15.030> brat<00:04:15.330> bounce<00:04:15.660> I'm<00:04:16.880> not

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:17.880 
moving with that brat bounce I'm not

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:20.960 
moving with that brat bounce I'm not
doing<00:04:18.150> this<00:04:19.520> which<00:04:20.520> would<00:04:20.640> be<00:04:20.760> very

00:04:20.960 --> 00:04:20.970 
doing this which would be very

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:23.840 
doing this which would be very
convenient<00:04:21.419> but<00:04:21.870> when<00:04:22.770> these<00:04:22.919> fingers<00:04:23.490> come

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:23.850 
convenient but when these fingers come

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:26.990 
convenient but when these fingers come
out<00:04:24.060> they<00:04:24.990> will<00:04:25.200> not<00:04:25.380> allow<00:04:25.710> the<00:04:25.770> whole<00:04:26.250> forum

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:27.000 
out they will not allow the whole forum

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:27.470 
out they will not allow the whole forum
that<00:04:27.180> has

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:27.480 
that has

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:30.560 
that has
turn<00:04:27.750> to<00:04:28.620> operate<00:04:29.100> because<00:04:29.790> they<00:04:30.210> won't<00:04:30.330> have

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:30.570 
turn to operate because they won't have

00:04:30.570 --> 00:04:34.220 
turn to operate because they won't have
to<00:04:31.250> the<00:04:32.250> this<00:04:32.490> arm<00:04:32.760> won't<00:04:32.880> have<00:04:33.090> to<00:04:33.210> operate<00:04:33.630> so

00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:34.230 
to the this arm won't have to operate so

00:04:34.230 --> 00:04:36.680 
to the this arm won't have to operate so
keeping<00:04:34.800> those<00:04:34.950> over<00:04:35.370> makes<00:04:36.330> the<00:04:36.540> whole

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:36.690 
keeping those over makes the whole

00:04:36.690 --> 00:04:42.770 
keeping those over makes the whole
forearm<00:04:39.410> turn<00:04:40.910> later<00:04:41.910> you<00:04:42.240> can<00:04:42.390> get<00:04:42.630> your

00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:42.780 
forearm turn later you can get your

00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:48.860 
forearm turn later you can get your
fingers<00:04:46.400> adjust<00:04:47.400> it<00:04:47.550> in<00:04:47.730> meanwhile<00:04:48.720> your

00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:48.870 
fingers adjust it in meanwhile your

00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:55.040 
fingers adjust it in meanwhile your
thumb<00:04:51.680> is<00:04:52.680> also<00:04:53.130> managing<00:04:54.120> the<00:04:54.210> stick<00:04:54.540> but

00:04:55.040 --> 00:04:55.050 
thumb is also managing the stick but

00:04:55.050 --> 00:04:57.140 
thumb is also managing the stick but
more<00:04:55.260> importantly<00:04:55.710> now<00:04:55.920> you<00:04:56.580> want<00:04:56.760> to<00:04:56.820> get<00:04:56.940> the

00:04:57.140 --> 00:04:57.150 
more importantly now you want to get the

00:04:57.150 --> 00:05:00.200 
more importantly now you want to get the
whole<00:04:57.330> wrist<00:04:57.720> to<00:04:57.990> turn<00:04:58.230> and<00:04:58.530> bounce<00:04:59.060> with<00:05:00.060> the

00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:00.210 
whole wrist to turn and bounce with the

00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:03.170 
whole wrist to turn and bounce with the
energy<00:05:00.570> of<00:05:00.600> the<00:05:00.720> stick<00:05:01.220> the<00:05:02.220> whole<00:05:02.400> idea<00:05:02.820> here

00:05:03.170 --> 00:05:03.180 
energy of the stick the whole idea here

00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:05.810 
energy of the stick the whole idea here
is<00:05:03.360> to<00:05:03.720> get<00:05:04.080> this<00:05:04.320> stick<00:05:04.650> to<00:05:04.680> bounce<00:05:05.040> out<00:05:05.490> of

00:05:05.810 --> 00:05:05.820 
is to get this stick to bounce out of

00:05:05.820 --> 00:05:09.340 
is to get this stick to bounce out of
the<00:05:05.910> drum<00:05:06.260> straight<00:05:07.260> out<00:05:07.410> of<00:05:07.500> the<00:05:07.590> drum

00:05:09.340 --> 00:05:09.350 
the drum straight out of the drum

00:05:09.350 --> 00:05:15.890 
the drum straight out of the drum
drawing<00:05:10.350> the<00:05:10.530> sound<00:05:10.800> out<00:05:11.040> of<00:05:11.070> the<00:05:11.250> drum<00:05:14.900> so

00:05:15.890 --> 00:05:15.900 
drawing the sound out of the drum so

00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:17.660 
drawing the sound out of the drum so
that<00:05:16.080> full<00:05:16.290> stroke<00:05:16.620> needs<00:05:16.890> to<00:05:17.070> be<00:05:17.190> matched<00:05:17.370> up

00:05:17.660 --> 00:05:17.670 
that full stroke needs to be matched up

00:05:17.670 --> 00:05:22.550 
that full stroke needs to be matched up
to<00:05:18.890> the<00:05:19.890> right<00:05:20.100> hand<00:05:20.400> you<00:05:21.230> don't<00:05:22.230> want<00:05:22.380> to<00:05:22.440> have

00:05:22.550 --> 00:05:22.560 
to the right hand you don't want to have

00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:24.620 
to the right hand you don't want to have
one<00:05:22.800> hand<00:05:22.980> down<00:05:23.250> here<00:05:23.640> one<00:05:23.850> hand<00:05:24.090> up<00:05:24.240> there<00:05:24.480> or

00:05:24.620 --> 00:05:24.630 
one hand down here one hand up there or

00:05:24.630 --> 00:05:27.230 
one hand down here one hand up there or
vice<00:05:24.660> versa<00:05:25.140> so<00:05:25.980> that<00:05:26.190> you<00:05:26.460> have<00:05:26.610> to<00:05:26.730> make<00:05:27.210> sure

00:05:27.230 --> 00:05:27.240 
vice versa so that you have to make sure

00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:29.600 
vice versa so that you have to make sure
that's<00:05:27.630> an<00:05:27.900> order<00:05:28.230> now<00:05:28.800> let's<00:05:28.980> talk<00:05:29.160> about<00:05:29.310> the

00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:29.610 
that's an order now let's talk about the

00:05:29.610 --> 00:05:32.000 
that's an order now let's talk about the
the<00:05:29.910> right<00:05:30.120> hand<00:05:30.390> bouncing<00:05:30.930> a<00:05:30.960> little<00:05:31.140> bit<00:05:31.290> the

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:32.010 
the right hand bouncing a little bit the

00:05:32.010 --> 00:05:33.530 
the right hand bouncing a little bit the
only<00:05:32.220> thing<00:05:32.370> that's<00:05:32.490> really<00:05:32.700> changing<00:05:33.240> here

00:05:33.530 --> 00:05:33.540 
only thing that's really changing here

00:05:33.540 --> 00:05:35.810 
only thing that's really changing here
is<00:05:33.690> that<00:05:34.290> we're<00:05:34.650> taking<00:05:34.800> the<00:05:35.130> pinky<00:05:35.490> that<00:05:35.520> was

00:05:35.810 --> 00:05:35.820 
is that we're taking the pinky that was

00:05:35.820 --> 00:05:39.140 
is that we're taking the pinky that was
holding<00:05:36.030> the<00:05:36.150> stick<00:05:36.480> on<00:05:36.920> the<00:05:37.920> the<00:05:38.670> hand<00:05:38.940> and

00:05:39.140 --> 00:05:39.150 
holding the stick on the the hand and

00:05:39.150 --> 00:05:42.260 
holding the stick on the the hand and
we're<00:05:39.690> just<00:05:39.870> letting<00:05:40.230> it<00:05:40.410> come<00:05:40.980> out<00:05:41.270> you're

00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:42.270 
we're just letting it come out you're

00:05:42.270 --> 00:05:44.740 
we're just letting it come out you're
not<00:05:42.420> going<00:05:42.660> to<00:05:42.780> let<00:05:42.900> it<00:05:43.050> draw<00:05:43.620> out<00:05:43.830> like<00:05:44.070> this

00:05:44.740 --> 00:05:44.750 
not going to let it draw out like this

00:05:44.750 --> 00:05:47.750 
not going to let it draw out like this
you're<00:05:45.750> going<00:05:45.930> to<00:05:46.050> just<00:05:46.290> keep<00:05:47.130> it<00:05:47.280> as<00:05:47.400> a<00:05:47.430> guard

00:05:47.750 --> 00:05:47.760 
you're going to just keep it as a guard

00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:49.370 
you're going to just keep it as a guard
and<00:05:48.000> these<00:05:48.090> fingers<00:05:48.510> will<00:05:48.690> definitely<00:05:49.200> help

00:05:49.370 --> 00:05:49.380 
and these fingers will definitely help

00:05:49.380 --> 00:05:53.210 
and these fingers will definitely help
you<00:05:49.620> as<00:05:49.860> you<00:05:50.520> develop<00:05:51.320> all<00:05:52.320> the<00:05:52.620> fingers<00:05:52.950> help

00:05:53.210 --> 00:05:53.220 
you as you develop all the fingers help

00:05:53.220 --> 00:05:54.980 
you as you develop all the fingers help
but<00:05:54.030> it's<00:05:54.150> the<00:05:54.330> risk<00:05:54.630> that<00:05:54.810> we're

00:05:54.980 --> 00:05:54.990 
but it's the risk that we're

00:05:54.990 --> 00:05:59.300 
but it's the risk that we're
concentrating<00:05:55.380> on<00:05:55.860> so<00:05:56.670> that<00:05:57.300> right<00:05:57.990> hand<00:05:58.320> now

00:05:59.300 --> 00:05:59.310 
concentrating on so that right hand now

00:05:59.310 --> 00:06:03.020 
concentrating on so that right hand now
is<00:05:59.610> a<00:05:59.640> very<00:06:00.060> light<00:06:00.900> grip<00:06:01.560> if<00:06:02.460> I<00:06:02.610> was<00:06:02.730> to<00:06:02.820> pull

00:06:03.020 --> 00:06:03.030 
is a very light grip if I was to pull

00:06:03.030 --> 00:06:05.900 
is a very light grip if I was to pull
that<00:06:03.180> in<00:06:03.390> my<00:06:03.480> hand<00:06:03.780> it's<00:06:04.080> just<00:06:04.350> very<00:06:04.910> hardly

00:06:05.900 --> 00:06:05.910 
that in my hand it's just very hardly

00:06:05.910 --> 00:06:08.270 
that in my hand it's just very hardly
tacky<00:06:06.300> at<00:06:06.570> all<00:06:06.750> it<00:06:07.230> has<00:06:07.350> to<00:06:07.380> be<00:06:07.560> a<00:06:07.590> very<00:06:07.770> slight

00:06:08.270 --> 00:06:08.280 
tacky at all it has to be a very slight

00:06:08.280 --> 00:06:10.310 
tacky at all it has to be a very slight
holding<00:06:09.240> or<00:06:09.330> else<00:06:09.450> you<00:06:09.540> drop<00:06:09.780> the<00:06:09.930> stick<00:06:10.140> out

00:06:10.310 --> 00:06:10.320 
holding or else you drop the stick out

00:06:10.320 --> 00:06:12.980 
holding or else you drop the stick out
of<00:06:10.350> your<00:06:10.590> hand<00:06:11.210> so<00:06:12.210> that<00:06:12.240> too<00:06:12.660> you<00:06:12.810> need<00:06:12.930> to

00:06:12.980 --> 00:06:12.990 
of your hand so that too you need to

00:06:12.990 --> 00:06:15.970 
of your hand so that too you need to
find<00:06:13.370> the<00:06:14.370> balance<00:06:14.520> point<00:06:14.790> of<00:06:15.210> that<00:06:15.330> stick

00:06:15.970 --> 00:06:15.980 
find the balance point of that stick

00:06:15.980 --> 00:06:21.140 
find the balance point of that stick
it's<00:06:16.980> actually<00:06:17.460> the<00:06:17.580> same<00:06:18.200> point<00:06:19.200> as<00:06:19.410> the<00:06:20.150> left

00:06:21.140 --> 00:06:21.150 
it's actually the same point as the left

00:06:21.150 --> 00:06:25.220 
it's actually the same point as the left
hand<00:06:21.500> so<00:06:22.500> it's<00:06:22.650> pretty<00:06:22.890> easy<00:06:23.040> to<00:06:23.280> catch<00:06:24.230> all

00:06:25.220 --> 00:06:25.230 
hand so it's pretty easy to catch all

00:06:25.230 --> 00:06:27.530 
hand so it's pretty easy to catch all
right<00:06:25.410> so
