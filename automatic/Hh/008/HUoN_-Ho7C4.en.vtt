okay<00:01:58.420> so<00:01:58.480> Phil<00:01:58.990> mixed<00:01:59.320> up<00:01:59.500> so<00:01:59.890> I'm<00:01:59.950> just<00:02:00.070> going

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:00.310 
okay so Phil mixed up so I'm just going

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:02.730 
okay so Phil mixed up so I'm just going
to<00:02:00.370> pour<00:02:01.360> it<00:02:01.450> out<00:02:01.540> on<00:02:01.780> my<00:02:01.930> pan<00:02:02.200> on<00:02:02.560> the

00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:02.740 
to pour it out on my pan on the

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:05.670 
to pour it out on my pan on the
parchment<00:02:02.950> paper<00:02:03.400> you<00:02:04.050> know<00:02:05.050> this<00:02:05.260> comes<00:02:05.530> out

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:05.680 
parchment paper you know this comes out

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:08.370 
parchment paper you know this comes out
thicker<00:02:06.150> different<00:02:07.150> times<00:02:07.390> that<00:02:07.930> I<00:02:07.960> make<00:02:08.200> it

00:02:08.370 --> 00:02:08.380 
thicker different times that I make it

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:11.390 
thicker different times that I make it
because<00:02:08.740> probably<00:02:09.310> I<00:02:09.340> don't<00:02:09.610> measure<00:02:10.000> exact

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:11.400 
because probably I don't measure exact

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:14.940 
because probably I don't measure exact
so<00:02:12.400> if<00:02:12.460> it's<00:02:12.610> thicker<00:02:13.000> and<00:02:13.420> you<00:02:13.900> can't<00:02:14.500> spread

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:14.950 
so if it's thicker and you can't spread

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:16.110 
so if it's thicker and you can't spread
it<00:02:15.190> as<00:02:15.430> easily

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:16.120

what<00:02:16.600> I<00:02:16.630> do<00:02:16.750> is<00:02:16.960> I<00:02:17.080> take<00:02:17.230> a<00:02:17.290> piece<00:02:17.560> of<00:02:18.690> saran

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:19.690 
what I do is I take a piece of saran

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:21.630 
what I do is I take a piece of saran
wrap<00:02:19.930> spray<00:02:20.560> it<00:02:20.620> with<00:02:20.740> nonstick<00:02:20.800> spray<00:02:21.310> and

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:23.110 
just put it on top of there and just

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:27.020 
just put it on top of there and just
spread<00:02:23.530> it<00:02:23.560> all<00:02:23.860> around<00:02:24.010> with<00:02:24.610> my<00:02:24.760> hands<00:02:25.290> but

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:27.030

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:32.140 
was able to spread it pretty easy so

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:40.199 
was able to spread it pretty easy so
there<00:02:32.440> it<00:02:32.560> is<00:02:32.680> all<00:02:33.310> spread<00:02:33.760> out<00:02:38.459> and<00:02:39.459> I<00:02:39.970> baked
