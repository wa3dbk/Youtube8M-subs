like the coho 29 that were tested

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:41.910 
pieces of kit put a lot of money in the

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:43.850 
pieces of kit put a lot of money in the
idea<00:00:42.210> of<00:00:42.300> this<00:00:42.420> is<00:00:42.840> to<00:00:43.050> give<00:00:43.200> you<00:00:43.290> the<00:00:43.590> windy

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:43.860 
idea of this is to give you the windy

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:46.940

DNA<00:00:44.310> but<00:00:44.850> at<00:00:44.970> a<00:00:45.000> much<00:00:45.270> lower<00:00:45.660> price<00:00:45.960> point<00:00:46.500> so

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950 
DNA but at a much lower price point so

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:48.290 
DNA but at a much lower price point so
what's<00:00:47.370> the<00:00:47.520> difference<00:00:47.850> well<00:00:48.060> a<00:00:48.090> big

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300 
what's the difference well a big

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:49.430 
what's the difference well a big
difference<00:00:48.630> with<00:00:48.750> this<00:00:48.840> of<00:00:49.020> course<00:00:49.050> for<00:00:49.410> a

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
difference with this of course for a

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:51.470 
difference with this of course for a
start<00:00:49.710> is<00:00:50.040> it's<00:00:50.280> outboard<00:00:50.790> engine<00:00:51.120> powered

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
start is it's outboard engine powered

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:53.389 
start is it's outboard engine powered
rather<00:00:52.200> than<00:00:52.470> the<00:00:52.590> imports<00:00:52.980> that<00:00:53.070> you<00:00:53.190> always

00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:53.399 
rather than the imports that you always

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:55.069 
rather than the imports that you always
get<00:00:53.610> on<00:00:53.730> a<00:00:53.790> windy<00:00:54.059> feel<00:00:54.480> the<00:00:54.600> big<00:00:54.750> difference

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079 
get on a windy feel the big difference

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:56.990 
get on a windy feel the big difference
of<00:00:55.200> course<00:00:55.260> is<00:00:55.710> further<00:00:56.280> forward<00:00:56.610> well<00:00:56.790> we've

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000 
of course is further forward well we've

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.240 
of course is further forward well we've
got<00:00:57.300> a<00:00:57.510> completely<00:00:58.290> open<00:00:58.530> bar<00:00:59.070> either

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
got a completely open bar either

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:00.889 
got a completely open bar either
standard<00:00:59.730> boat<00:00:59.940> rather<00:01:00.300> than<00:01:00.600> the<00:01:00.690> carry

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899 
standard boat rather than the carry

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:04.100 
standard boat rather than the carry
cabin<00:01:01.260> cabins<00:01:02.070> that<00:01:02.340> you<00:01:02.700> get<00:01:02.880> on<00:01:03.000> a<00:01:03.030> windy<00:01:03.420> the

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
cabin cabins that you get on a windy the

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:05.810 
cabin cabins that you get on a windy the
other<00:01:04.229> thing<00:01:04.409> is<00:01:04.559> that<00:01:04.739> the<00:01:04.830> hull<00:01:05.010> on<00:01:05.129> this<00:01:05.339> is

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
other thing is that the hull on this is

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:08.570 
other thing is that the hull on this is
a<00:01:06.270> cat<00:01:06.690> sea<00:01:06.990> rather<00:01:07.380> than<00:01:07.560> the<00:01:07.650> cat<00:01:07.860> B<00:01:08.100> so<00:01:08.400> it's

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
a cat sea rather than the cat B so it's

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:10.969 
a cat sea rather than the cat B so it's
a<00:01:08.700> really<00:01:08.940> capable<00:01:09.750> coastal<00:01:10.440> boat<00:01:10.620> rather

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979 
a really capable coastal boat rather

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:12.950 
a really capable coastal boat rather
than<00:01:11.220> actually<00:01:11.610> offshore<00:01:12.180> machine<00:01:12.479> but<00:01:12.840> what

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 
than actually offshore machine but what

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:14.870 
than actually offshore machine but what
this<00:01:13.080> does<00:01:13.140> is<00:01:14.010> it<00:01:14.159> provides<00:01:14.430> a<00:01:14.670> fantastic

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880
