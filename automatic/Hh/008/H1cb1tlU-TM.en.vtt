what I can tell you is the magic link

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:37.700 
what I can tell you is the magic link
system<00:00:34.200> and<00:00:34.590> these<00:00:34.710> cons<00:00:34.980> is<00:00:35.309> pretty<00:00:36.710> pretty

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710 
system and these cons is pretty pretty

system and these cons is pretty pretty
trick<00:00:38.100> how<00:00:38.670> it<00:00:38.850> works<00:00:39.410> it's<00:00:40.410> progressive<00:00:41.129> you

00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:41.309 
trick how it works it's progressive you

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:44.209 
trick how it works it's progressive you
get<00:00:41.430> two<00:00:41.640> inches<00:00:41.820> of<00:00:42.090> travel<00:00:42.800> during<00:00:43.800> most<00:00:44.070> of
