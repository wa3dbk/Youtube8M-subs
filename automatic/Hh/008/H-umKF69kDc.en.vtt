00:04:58.260 --> 00:04:58.270 
time seeing him and attempting him and

00:04:58.270 --> 00:05:01.689 
time seeing him and attempting him and
he<00:04:59.270> posed<00:04:59.900> relatively<00:05:00.500> no<00:05:00.710> problems<00:05:01.130> so<00:05:01.310> I

00:05:01.689 --> 00:05:01.699 
he posed relatively no problems so I

00:05:01.699 --> 00:05:03.400
