00:00:08.050 --> 00:00:11.690
 we're here at the gigabyte booth at 

00:00:10.340 --> 00:00:13.130
 computex 2014 

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:14.780
 Let's show you two new ones. 

00:00:13.130 --> 00:00:16.460
 cooling systems that the company 

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:18.380
 is launching here at the event 

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:20.689
 we have my right here or until 

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:22.999
 force and there on the left we have the i 

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:25.869
 forum here liquid refrigeration and other 

00:00:22.999 --> 00:00:25.869
 revelation area 

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:38.390
 another force is a customized design of the 

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:40.400
 gigabyte for liquid cooling 

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:42.740
 of three plates simultaneously 

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:45.110
 so the cabinet is not part of the 

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:47.840
 package what is the force actor is this 

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:50.330
 great radiator here with several fans and 

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:51.800
 you see who has the pipes bringing 

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:54.140
 liquid to jump into the cabinet. 

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:57.170
 has fit that format 

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:58.520
 default cd drives and all of it here 

00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:01.010
 go here inside 

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:03.560
 to cool three working plates 

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:06.859
 simultaneously we have here three gtx 

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:08.749
 480 ti operating together and 

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:10.939
 gigabyte kuryaki liquidity system 

00:01:08.749 --> 00:01:12.070
 Can you control it here in the panel? 

00:01:10.939 --> 00:01:14.119
 front 

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:16.460
 individually the operation of each 

00:01:14.119 --> 00:01:18.229
 so I can make changes here 

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:21.109
 operating temperature 

00:01:18.229 --> 00:01:23.450
 I will stay here and I can do even 

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:25.969
 individually then you can change 

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:28.460
 in order to change the speed 

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:31.100
 of the fans to the flow of the 

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:32.689
 here by the system to accelerate the 

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:35.479
 to slow down 

00:01:32.689 --> 00:01:36.170
 so it's a solution for enthusiast 

00:01:35.479 --> 00:01:38.270
 same 

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:40.429
 The cool thing is that by being rich in sometimes 

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:41.990
 It happens that you have many 

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:43.850
 video in hand although it should stay 

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:45.819
 practically touching the 

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:48.829
 that this solution here of the gigabyte 

00:01:45.819 --> 00:01:53.060
 managed to give even an uncertain space 

00:01:48.829 --> 00:01:55.789
 between the boards receive these 3 781 

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:57.799
 relatively comfortable here is 

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:59.119
 Of course we are talking about a 

00:01:57.799 --> 00:02:01.960
 totally geared towards 

00:01:59.119 --> 00:02:03.850
 enthusiasts and high cost 

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:06.970
 one is sold separate like the cure 

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:09.280
 you get the three 780 boards you have 

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:11.650
 gigabyte and the system as everything together 

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:13.030
 and how to serve here in box for is 

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:15.970
 simple you can put the radiator 

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:17.410
 up here for this whole area and the e 

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:18.310
 fits that should work very 

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:19.930
 cabinet 

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:22.989
 so it's a solution that you can 

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:25.720
 use on multiple computers but you 

00:02:22.989 --> 00:02:28.060
 You need to buy it all together and it's obvious 

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:32.260
 that she will come out face then radiator 

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:34.900
 but these 3 781 then as priceless 

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:38.080
 still defined but there is the expectation that 

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:41.560
 able below 3 thousand dollars 

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:43.570
 can be very well 2999 2909 dollars more 

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:46.420
 it's a solution that's still over today 

00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:48.070
 plus the prototype level is not sure if 

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:50.440
 will reach the market promises few 

00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:51.790
 parts will arrive but this is a job of the 

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:54.040
 gigabyte to launch a product 

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:59.440
 differentiated like the cure for three 

00:02:54.040 --> 00:03:01.030
 cards at the same time leaving the 

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:01.720
 liquid cooling for cooling 

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:03.519
 air 

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:06.040
 we have a strong group it's a project 

00:03:03.519 --> 00:03:08.170
 differentiated from the gigabyte to the 

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:10.299
 video in this case here we have apt 

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:12.880
 she turns and promises to go from 

00:03:10.299 --> 00:03:14.350
 600 banks a board of or be a board 

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:16.840
 high performance 

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:18.820
 for the moment this system is only 

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:20.620
 to the team but who knows in the future we have 

00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:25.150
 other high performance cards such as 

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:26.829
 this project is differentiated with this 

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:28.930
 technology that the gigabyte promexico 

00:03:26.829 --> 00:03:31.480
 other heat dissipation will 

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:34.450
 increase by up to 45% and the temperature can 

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:35.230
 be reduced by 35% on the 

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:37.000
 reference 

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:39.040
 remembering that the country already has a project 

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:40.510
 of differentiated nvidia then we are 

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:41.680
 talking about an evolution about something that 

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:44.019
 already works very well 

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:46.269
 the cost of what I heard here speak of 

00:03:44.019 --> 00:03:48.910
 executives is about the afternoon in the original 

00:03:46.269 --> 00:03:51.010
 is costing $ 950 

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:54.600
 the one that should arrive for thousand and 99 

00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:54.600
 dollars to the market
