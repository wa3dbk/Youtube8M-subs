00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:42.420 
start guitar and wherever I played

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:44.000 
start guitar and wherever I played
people<00:03:42.750> were<00:03:42.870> curious<00:03:43.110> about<00:03:43.379> the<00:03:43.560> instrument

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:44.010 
people were curious about the instrument

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:45.170 
people were curious about the instrument
and<00:03:44.069> they<00:03:44.160> wanted<00:03:44.370> to<00:03:44.430> hear<00:03:44.579> me<00:03:44.700> play<00:03:44.730> more<00:03:45.090> and

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:45.180 
and they wanted to hear me play more and

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:47.390 
and they wanted to hear me play more and
more<00:03:45.360> of<00:03:45.450> the<00:03:45.510> bass<00:03:45.720> strings<00:03:45.959> so<00:03:46.829> eventually<00:03:47.220> I

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:47.400 
more of the bass strings so eventually I

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:49.100 
more of the bass strings so eventually I
started<00:03:47.579> incorporating<00:03:47.940> the<00:03:48.360> bass<00:03:48.540> into<00:03:48.959> it

00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:49.110 
started incorporating the bass into it

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:53.820 
started incorporating the bass into it
and<00:03:49.410> so<00:03:49.980> I've<00:03:50.129> been<00:03:50.190> playing<00:03:50.370> it<00:03:50.579> since<00:03:50.720> 1972

00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:53.830 

00:03:53.830 --> 00:03:56.470 

there's<00:03:54.830> something<00:03:55.190> about<00:03:55.280> just<00:03:56.270> this

00:03:56.470 --> 00:03:56.480 
there's something about just this

00:03:56.480 --> 00:03:57.760 
there's something about just this
instrument<00:03:57.020> that's<00:03:57.200> different<00:03:57.590> than<00:03:57.740> a

00:03:57.760 --> 00:03:57.770 
instrument that's different than a

00:03:57.770 --> 00:03:59.020 
instrument that's different than a
regular<00:03:57.860> guitar<00:03:58.490> it's<00:03:58.670> like<00:03:58.760> another

00:03:59.020 --> 00:03:59.030 
regular guitar it's like another

00:03:59.030 --> 00:04:00.880 
regular guitar it's like another
instrument<00:03:59.390> all<00:03:59.600> together<00:03:59.750> I<00:04:00.230> liked<00:04:00.680> the<00:04:00.800> way

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:00.890 
instrument all together I liked the way

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:03.550 
instrument all together I liked the way
it<00:04:00.920> looked<00:04:01.040> it<00:04:01.370> was<00:04:01.460> intriguing<00:04:01.850> and<00:04:02.300> the<00:04:03.140> the

00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:03.560 
it looked it was intriguing and the the

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:08.020 
it looked it was intriguing and the the
long<00:04:03.830> pedal<00:04:04.280> bass<00:04:04.580> notes<00:04:05.980> you<00:04:06.980> know<00:04:07.100> the<00:04:07.430> whole

00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:08.030 
long pedal bass notes you know the whole

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:12.240 
long pedal bass notes you know the whole
mystique<00:04:08.450> about<00:04:08.630> it<00:04:08.930> so<00:04:09.740> for<00:04:10.070> me<00:04:10.240> you<00:04:11.240> know

00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:12.250 
mystique about it so for me you know

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:14.470 
mystique about it so for me you know
essentially<00:04:13.250> just<00:04:13.430> think<00:04:13.940> that<00:04:14.060> it's<00:04:14.240> one<00:04:14.450> of

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:14.480 
essentially just think that it's one of

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:15.610 
essentially just think that it's one of
the<00:04:14.600> most<00:04:14.810> unique<00:04:15.140> and<00:04:15.350> interesting

00:04:15.610 --> 00:04:15.620 
the most unique and interesting

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:19.090 
the most unique and interesting
instruments<00:04:16.340> on<00:04:16.459> its<00:04:16.580> own<00:04:16.840> but<00:04:17.840> then<00:04:18.049> I<00:04:18.350> think

00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:19.100 
instruments on its own but then I think

00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:20.560 
instruments on its own but then I think
there's<00:04:19.250> a<00:04:19.340> lot<00:04:19.489> more<00:04:19.640> to<00:04:19.790> be<00:04:19.880> done<00:04:20.120> with<00:04:20.330> it

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:20.570 
there's a lot more to be done with it

00:04:20.570 --> 00:04:21.970 
there's a lot more to be done with it
I<00:04:20.600> don't<00:04:20.870> think<00:04:21.080> there's<00:04:21.200> been<00:04:21.260> enough<00:04:21.709> done

00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:21.980 
I don't think there's been enough done

00:04:21.980 --> 00:04:24.130 
I don't think there's been enough done
harp<00:04:22.430> guitar<00:04:22.760> and<00:04:23.480> so<00:04:23.600> I<00:04:23.660> saw<00:04:23.870> an<00:04:24.020> opportunity

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:24.140 
harp guitar and so I saw an opportunity

00:04:24.140 --> 00:04:30.439 
harp guitar and so I saw an opportunity
to<00:04:24.890> sort<00:04:25.100> of<00:04:25.220> find<00:04:25.910> something<00:04:26.240> new

00:04:30.439 --> 00:04:30.449 

00:04:30.449 --> 00:04:33.649 

I<00:04:30.539> started<00:04:31.499> harp<00:04:31.710> guitar<00:04:32.009> about<00:04:32.819> I<00:04:33.180> guess<00:04:33.479> it

00:04:33.649 --> 00:04:33.659 
I started harp guitar about I guess it

00:04:33.659 --> 00:04:35.239 
I started harp guitar about I guess it
would<00:04:33.749> be<00:04:33.779> maybe<00:04:34.439> six<00:04:34.710> and<00:04:34.860> a<00:04:34.889> half<00:04:34.919> years<00:04:35.189> ago

00:04:35.239 --> 00:04:35.249 
would be maybe six and a half years ago

00:04:35.249 --> 00:04:36.559 
would be maybe six and a half years ago
since<00:04:35.580> I<00:04:35.639> came<00:04:35.699> to<00:04:35.909> the<00:04:36.029> first<00:04:36.180> hartford
