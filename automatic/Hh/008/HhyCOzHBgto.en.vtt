 Description 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:01.680
 just grievances coach point nl and the case 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:03.059
 cords hoarsely used you get 5% 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:04.710
 discount on those coins 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:07.290
 which come in the match with a 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:08.820
 3 a goal from memphis depay 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:10.530
 i dirk my regular park very important 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:12.570
 and I also asked an old person if 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:14.580
 I keep the carbon from the pan 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:15.659
 I only do that around this time 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:17.880
 will that really be one 

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:18.810
 yes i don't know a bit odd number 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:20.790
 encrypted does out of nine 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:22.590
 matches and the 20 goals so that 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:25.110
 is quite decent, by the way , I can 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:27.150
 really ill fate with'm tapping 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:29.549
 I note his two sources of error reedy 

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:30.420
 don't leave abandoned shocked 5 with Kevin 

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:32.009
 mirallas 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:33.990
 ultimately the score will be determined here 

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:35.700
 showing the 6 in after i got my play 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:37.770
 posted and send it and I resulted 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:39.450
 that once in a six and a guide 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:40.740
 pits for my opponent but 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:42.390
 call like me you don't hear complaining because 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:43.890
 I just finished faster 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:45.570
 the match and I know so come in 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:47.009
 in the form of the law which are attributed 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:48.840
 cacti pretty good we are here 

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:50.850
 always undefeated and that means we 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:52.590
 good at going for the division and 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:54.600
 now feel ashamed in our before the game 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:57.299
 and these before the match come up against 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:58.710
 a player with something very good team 

00:01:57.299 --> 00:02:00.180
 on now I will not see any 

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:01.950
 he has very bad chemistry and 

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:03.570
 are pagoda players and for the right 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:05.310
 a little bronze and then I like it 

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:06.600
 because as may before delivery said in 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:08.580
 I only come to the previous bread 

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:10.379
 against sick teams and now plague stalls 

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:12.480
 against people's value means that I 

00:02:10.379 --> 00:02:12.930
 brand cheap number of memphis can 

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:14.879
 story 

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:16.290
 ok and that comes the points he plays 

00:02:14.879 --> 00:02:17.129
 she's crazy and you know what 's going on 

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:18.989
 to happen 

00:02:17.129 --> 00:02:20.640
 a striking shot no bottle because I have 

00:02:18.989 --> 00:02:22.319
 previously said that figure in addition to which they 

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:24.569
 very good free of not so good 

00:02:22.319 --> 00:02:26.430
 with other players of course because are 

00:02:24.569 --> 00:02:27.870
 face initially high is like a junk shot 

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:29.790
 are also fantastic just like those of 

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:31.620
 leroy fer with this devastating swipe 

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:33.420
 could not fight that would score but 

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:35.040
 eventually the sees made jantje 

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:37.049
 though the game best of all access to 

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:38.760
 the end of the first half not charger 

00:02:37.049 --> 00:02:40.739
 lee stand here in a very crucial place 

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:42.480
 possession of the ball and then I can make the four zero 

00:02:40.739 --> 00:02:44.280
 starts shooting and that is a 90 minutes 

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:45.959
 So that also means the final agreement 

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:48.329
 is for my side and we want that 

00:02:45.959 --> 00:02:49.889
 this competition with 400 again a great one 

00:02:48.329 --> 00:02:51.629
 result is of course a stone 

00:02:49.889 --> 00:02:53.159
 safescan maybe 10 so you can still there 

00:02:51.629 --> 00:02:53.700
 don't really say they seem busy 

00:02:53.159 --> 00:02:55.260
 to be 

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:57.090
 of course on megaball that I already have 

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:58.409
 won so many times in a row and so 

00:02:57.090 --> 00:02:59.879
 can celebrate that with the new one 

00:02:58.409 --> 00:03:01.709
 purchase I had a new sample pack 

00:02:59.879 --> 00:03:03.359
 needed for as with other central bikes 

00:03:01.709 --> 00:03:05.310
 or rich specs and so I had to have one 

00:03:03.359 --> 00:03:07.319
 evil a new belgian defender 

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:08.760
 looked like the simon i'm going for the 

00:03:07.319 --> 00:03:10.439
 gods but I actually wanted to go first 

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:12.060
 Have a silver to put it up a bit 

00:03:10.439 --> 00:03:13.650
 to build so that the app will be great 

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:15.450
 they do not immediately go on a device 

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:16.709
 from bronze to large because that is anyway 

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:18.239
 something else I missed in my 

00:03:16.709 --> 00:03:20.400
 Previous you want and that's actually me 

00:03:18.239 --> 00:03:22.290
 immediately went cold and I still have 

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:24.209
 apps are the intermediate step of which is bronze 

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:25.769
 to silver and then from silver to large 

00:03:24.209 --> 00:03:27.239
 I like that in itself until on 

00:03:25.769 --> 00:03:29.159
 stop it really because the on 

00:03:27.239 --> 00:03:30.239
 housing concept the more by way of 

00:03:29.159 --> 00:03:31.379
 that's just my opinion i don't know 

00:03:30.239 --> 00:03:32.699
 maybe at one then disagree 

00:03:31.379 --> 00:03:34.829
 but has not already happened 

00:03:32.699 --> 00:03:36.659
 just like this goal of the pie a bit 

00:03:34.829 --> 00:03:37.949
 like a financial my god in it 

00:03:36.659 --> 00:03:39.659
 and on the thing it is two norske 

00:03:37.949 --> 00:03:41.370
 skog which will probably be back with 

00:03:39.659 --> 00:03:42.659
 the good attack when is also costs 

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:44.699
 nothing very good team but I have to 

00:03:42.659 --> 00:03:46.169
 say that this player is very good 

00:03:44.699 --> 00:03:48.180
 that is just a very good difference most of the time 

00:03:46.169 --> 00:03:50.280
 its the team nothing about how the how good 

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:51.659
 or bad the opponent is because it 

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:53.250
 bag to the previous bread your then came 

00:03:51.659 --> 00:03:54.629
 I am already against teams so is a teams and 

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:55.319
 then it actually almost always won 

00:03:54.629 --> 00:03:56.970
 against 

00:03:55.319 --> 00:03:58.500
 way you very often have that bad 

00:03:56.970 --> 00:04:00.629
 teams usually quite good ones 

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:02.159
 play kind of put alone 

00:04:00.629 --> 00:04:03.930
 so I come across as desirable 

00:04:02.159 --> 00:04:04.470
 complete the pie here 

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:05.939
 get it 

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:07.709
 it really would be a wonderful benefit 

00:04:05.939 --> 00:04:09.540
 I score it myself and gut is the in four 

00:04:07.709 --> 00:04:11.639
 where will the spain ball bring that back 

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:13.139
 this for pass header and that is coming 

00:04:11.639 --> 00:04:14.939
 the two four but I'll be good at it again 

00:04:13.139 --> 00:04:16.620
 the food to throw in a crucial spot 

00:04:14.939 --> 00:04:18.810
 take over the ball and there I have 

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:19.979
 just open shooting opportunity with mirallas and 

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:21.750
 that of course also makes a heaven or 

00:04:19.979 --> 00:04:23.639
 because as god said more everything is real 

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:24.990
 only a few so he will release the tension 

00:04:23.639 --> 00:04:25.770
 or to bring them back again because 

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:28.229
 here he comes with one 

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:29.400
 very nice swipe on the 3 5 and not 

00:04:28.229 --> 00:04:31.410
 much later he comes with a number 

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:33.120
 to x not paying attention i know 

00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:34.169
 not to do my tactics but was 

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:36.210
 was playing to make someone not look good 

00:04:34.169 --> 00:04:38.520
 man dykes and then comfort cupboard is also 

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:40.199
 again very good finish 

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:41.759
 eventually it will challenges them to beaches 

00:04:40.199 --> 00:04:43.050
 four five victory so we have again 

00:04:41.759 --> 00:04:44.879
 all matches in this episode 

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:46.620
 so I won the end of episode 

00:04:44.879 --> 00:04:48.300
 so buy it you liked 

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:49.919
 do n't find it no longer late art 

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:51.150
 because it is huge to him 

00:04:49.919 --> 00:04:52.949
 You can also follow me wittelings too 

00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:54.389
 embarrassed it is from hoaxes 

00:04:52.949 --> 00:04:55.919
 he i can subscribe if you have it 

00:04:54.389 --> 00:04:58.610
 done and the video is up 

00:04:55.919 --> 00:04:58.610
 later on
