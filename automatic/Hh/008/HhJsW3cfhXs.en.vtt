and<00:02:09.780> lightly<00:02:10.780> just<00:02:11.230> like<00:02:11.680> styling<00:02:12.670> it<00:02:12.930> into

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:13.930 
and lightly just like styling it into

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:18.180 
and lightly just like styling it into
the<00:02:15.870> so<00:02:16.870> this<00:02:17.110> isn't<00:02:17.379> the<00:02:17.440> brush<00:02:17.620> I<00:02:17.739> use<00:02:17.890> like

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:18.190

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:25.000 
that with the the paint and then I just

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:30.930 
that with the the paint and then I just
pull<00:02:25.900> it<00:02:26.400> else<00:02:27.400> well<00:02:27.670> the<00:02:28.420> whole<00:02:28.569> area<00:02:29.940> and

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:30.940 
pull it else well the whole area and

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:33.030 
pull it else well the whole area and
then<00:02:31.360> what<00:02:31.480> I<00:02:31.510> do<00:02:31.599> after<00:02:32.049> that<00:02:32.080> is<00:02:32.530> I'll<00:02:32.860> cut

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:33.040 
then what I do after that is I'll cut

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:34.380 
then what I do after that is I'll cut

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:06.190 
dry and then cut it to shape and then

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:09.930 
dry and then cut it to shape and then
just<00:03:06.400> put<00:03:07.120> it<00:03:07.150> on<00:03:07.269> the<00:03:07.390> morrow<00:03:07.859> so<00:03:08.859> let<00:03:09.700> me<00:03:09.790> know
