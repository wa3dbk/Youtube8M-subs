the hockey was it was just hockey there
wasn't<00:02:11.240> really<00:02:11.480> any<00:02:11.600> tactics<00:02:12.140> and<00:02:12.320> stuff<00:02:13.100> like

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:13.250

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:15.400 
wasn't really any tactics and stuff like
that<00:02:13.460> but<00:02:13.670> just<00:02:13.970> speaking<00:02:14.630> the<00:02:14.750> language<00:02:15.200> and

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:15.410 
that but just speaking the language and

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:17.470 
that but just speaking the language and
knowing<00:02:15.650> the<00:02:15.740> culture<00:02:15.950> a<00:02:16.160> little<00:02:16.460> bit<00:02:16.610> and<00:02:16.790> you

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:17.480 
knowing the culture a little bit and you

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:20.020 
knowing the culture a little bit and you
know<00:02:17.600> it's<00:02:17.750> it's<00:02:18.140> not<00:02:18.350> as<00:02:18.530> big<00:02:18.740> as<00:02:18.860> a<00:02:18.890> shock<00:02:19.220> to

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:20.030 
know it's it's not as big as a shock to

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:22.210 
know it's it's not as big as a shock to
me<00:02:20.180> and<00:02:20.390> probably<00:02:20.750> Willie<00:02:21.140> and<00:02:21.650> two<00:02:22.040> other

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:22.220 
me and probably Willie and two other

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:23.950 
me and probably Willie and two other
kids<00:02:22.400> that<00:02:22.670> haven't<00:02:23.240> been<00:02:23.300> to<00:02:23.540> the<00:02:23.600> America
