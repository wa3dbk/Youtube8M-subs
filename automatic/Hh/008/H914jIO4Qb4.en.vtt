00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:02.300 
think the choreography was that
challenging<00:02:00.750> it<00:02:00.899> had<00:02:01.079> a<00:02:01.110> lot<00:02:01.380> of<00:02:01.409> energy<00:02:01.860> and

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:02.310 
challenging it had a lot of energy and

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:05.929 
challenging it had a lot of energy and
it<00:02:02.399> was<00:02:02.490> fun<00:02:02.960> but<00:02:03.960> were<00:02:04.770> finale<00:02:05.310> it<00:02:05.610> should

00:02:05.929 --> 00:02:05.939 
it was fun but were finale it should

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:10.120 
it was fun but were finale it should
kind<00:02:06.299> of<00:02:06.360> like<00:02:06.600> be<00:02:07.200> amazing<00:02:07.860> the<00:02:08.340> song<00:02:08.580> whip<00:02:08.819> it

00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:10.130 
kind of like be amazing the song whip it

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:11.530 
kind of like be amazing the song whip it
then<00:02:10.280> reminds<00:02:10.760> me<00:02:10.910> of<00:02:11.030> the<00:02:11.120> swiffer

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:11.540 
then reminds me of the swiffer

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:15.580 
then reminds me of the swiffer
commercial<00:02:12.170> so<00:02:12.610> maybe<00:02:13.660> that's<00:02:14.660> why<00:02:14.930> I<00:02:14.960> was<00:02:15.260> not

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:15.590 
commercial so maybe that's why I was not

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:18.190 
commercial so maybe that's why I was not
