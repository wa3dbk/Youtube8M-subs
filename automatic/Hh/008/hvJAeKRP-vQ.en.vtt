can't tell the difference between this

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:24.910 
can't tell the difference between this
and<00:03:22.730> one<00:03:22.970> of<00:03:23.060> our<00:03:23.150> rounded<00:03:23.510> ones<00:03:23.690> if<00:03:24.680> I<00:03:24.769> had<00:03:24.890> a

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:24.920 
and one of our rounded ones if I had a

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:26.520 
and one of our rounded ones if I had a
wave<00:03:25.160> actually<00:03:25.430> technically<00:03:26.120> and

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:26.530 
wave actually technically and

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:29.340 
wave actually technically and
scientifically<00:03:27.530> testing<00:03:28.130> it<00:03:28.220> I<00:03:28.310> would<00:03:28.550> but

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:29.350 
scientifically testing it I would but

00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:31.300 
scientifically testing it I would but
they<00:03:30.350> will<00:03:30.500> come<00:03:30.650> up<00:03:30.680> with<00:03:30.800> something<00:03:31.069> later

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:31.310 
they will come up with something later

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:34.330 
they will come up with something later
but<00:03:31.550> as<00:03:32.390> it<00:03:32.600> is<00:03:32.720> I<00:03:32.960> think<00:03:33.140> it's<00:03:33.380> a<00:03:33.440> myth<00:03:33.680> as<00:03:33.890> for

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:34.340 
but as it is I think it's a myth as for

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:37.540 
but as it is I think it's a myth as for
as<00:03:34.550> a<00:03:34.790> small<00:03:35.569> trailer<00:03:36.430> compromising<00:03:37.430> by

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:37.550 
as a small trailer compromising by

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:40.979 
as a small trailer compromising by
having<00:03:37.790> a<00:03:37.849> flat<00:03:38.030> front<00:03:38.410> but<00:03:39.410> we'll<00:03:39.890> see<00:03:40.099> and

00:03:40.979 --> 00:03:40.989 
having a flat front but we'll see and

00:03:40.989 --> 00:03:43.449 
having a flat front but we'll see and
