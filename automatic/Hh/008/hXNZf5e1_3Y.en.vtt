00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:23.490
 technological advances could make 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:27.000
 that life on planet earth had 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:29.699
 his days numbered since according to 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.500
 some experts some research 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:34.350
 scientific studies will have negative effects 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:36.700
 that could destroy the 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:39.190
 universe completely 

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:41.350
 scientific experiments improve 

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:44.650
 our society and help us to know 

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:47.440
 better the world we live in but 

00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:51.130
 some of them could put us in 

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:53.370
 danger and even take down the 

00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:53.370
 humanity 

00:00:54.130 --> 00:00:59.770
 in this video I'm going to introduce you 5 

00:00:57.340 --> 00:01:03.810
 scientific experiments that could 

00:00:59.770 --> 00:01:03.810
 endanger our existence 

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:09.570
 and the recreation of the big bag 

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:17.540
 the big band that gave birth to the universe 

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:19.900
 it's still one of the biggest 

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:22.600
 mysteries for the scientific world 

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:25.240
 the large hadron collider the 

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:27.460
 26 circular particle accelerator 

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:30.100
 kilometers long located on the 

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:32.890
 Franco-Swiss border could unveil 

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:36.000
 some of these unknowns but also 

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:36.000
 could destroy us 

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:58.570
 this collider was launched 

00:01:55.120 --> 00:02:00.730
 in September 2008 and reproduces a 

00:01:58.570 --> 00:02:03.730
 million explosions like milan 

00:02:00.730 --> 00:02:06.280
 per second but its main problem 

00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:08.320
 is that nobody knows exactly which 

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:11.740
 may be the consequences of these 

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:15.160
 experiments it is said that if this 

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:18.070
 collider comes to fail would cause 

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:22.500
 an explosion that would kill the 

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:22.500
 planet earth completely 

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:34.430
 the effect according to quantum 

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:36.620
 the antigravity or dark energy is one 

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:39.650
 of the topics that most interest awakens 

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:42.920
 among scientists but its simple 

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:46.790
 observation could be very dangerous 

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:49.190
 according to scientist Lawrence Krauss the 

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:52.250
 study of this energy can cause 

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:55.400
 its destruction what is known as the 

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:57.500
 quantum xenon effect 

00:02:55.400 --> 00:03:00.260
 according to the teacher when observing 

00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:03.400
 particles are you changing or rather 

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:06.260
 they change the level at which it decomposes 

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:08.540
 cravos believes that the fateful result of 

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:11.450
 these investigations will not take long 

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:13.849
 to arrive taking into account that a 

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:15.680
 the end of the 90s when the 

00:03:13.849 --> 00:03:18.380
 scientists discovered the energy 

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:22.300
 dark a series of 

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:22.300
 supernova explosions 

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:30.170
 the strange stuff 

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:33.170
 strange matter is a substance 

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:35.450
 hypothetical composed of four the 

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:38.930
 particles that build our 

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:42.200
 actually there are two hypotheses about this 

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:44.630
 matter the first one states that this 

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:47.990
 disappears immediately after being 

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:50.600
 general, the second suggests that 

00:03:47.990 --> 00:03:52.910
 stabilizes and starts to turn into the 

00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:56.180
 same strange matter all the atoms 

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:59.210
 they find on their way all over 

00:03:56.180 --> 00:04:02.650
 it the results of its appearance in 

00:03:59.210 --> 00:04:05.650
 the earth could be totally 

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:05.650
 disastrous 

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:10.730
 fortunately for us the matter 

00:04:08.569 --> 00:04:13.040
 strange can only arise as a result 

00:04:10.730 --> 00:04:16.010
 of high-energy collisions in the 

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:18.680
 elementary particles so that they do not 

00:04:16.010 --> 00:04:22.280
 there is danger except for the great 

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:25.010
 hadron collider when building the 

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:28.040
 particle accelerator scientists 

00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:30.680
 they hoped to discover that they are generated at 

00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:33.410
 collide the atoms in a huge tunnel 

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:37.660
 underground and strange matter figure 

00:04:33.410 --> 00:04:37.660
 on the list of possible discoveries 

00:04:42.169 --> 00:04:46.539
 travel through time 

00:04:48.510 --> 00:04:53.200
 to the many possible ways to put 

00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:55.540
 end to the universe with the help of the great 

00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:59.020
 hadron collider could 

00:04:55.540 --> 00:05:01.419
 add travel through time 

00:04:59.020 --> 00:05:03.520
 One of the suggestions is that 

00:05:01.419 --> 00:05:05.650
 continuous high-energy conditions of 

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:08.830
 the elementary particles in the 

00:05:05.650 --> 00:05:11.560
 collider could open a hole in 

00:05:08.830 --> 00:05:13.690
 the fabric of the universe and that the 

00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:15.940
 future generations could use it 

00:05:13.690 --> 00:05:18.280
 to travel through time with 

00:05:15.940 --> 00:05:21.150
 all the consequences and risks that 

00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:21.150
 this would entail 

00:05:23.169 --> 00:05:29.190
 a master technology 

00:05:26.370 --> 00:05:31.800
 modern nanotechnologies have as 

00:05:29.190 --> 00:05:34.449
 goal to produce devices more and more 

00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:37.629
 small and more complex 

00:05:34.449 --> 00:05:40.090
 the increasingly advanced nanotechnology 

00:05:37.629 --> 00:05:43.150
 allows you to create robots the size of a 

00:05:40.090 --> 00:05:45.819
 molecule what would imply huge 

00:05:43.150 --> 00:05:48.129
 improvements in the field of health this 

00:05:45.819 --> 00:05:50.889
 technology could allow for example 

00:05:48.129 --> 00:05:52.749
 that millions of microscopic machines 

00:05:50.889 --> 00:05:55.809
 travel through the blood vessels 

00:05:52.749 --> 00:05:59.249
 of sick people to attack by 

00:05:55.809 --> 00:06:03.120
 example a malignant tumor or a virus but 

00:05:59.249 --> 00:06:05.740
 fantasies aside there is a real problem 

00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:08.349
 how to mass produce these tiny 

00:06:05.740 --> 00:06:11.169
 appliances the solution would go through 

00:06:08.349 --> 00:06:14.220
 teach themselves to occur 

00:06:11.169 --> 00:06:17.310
 from materials from their environment 

00:06:14.220 --> 00:06:19.410
 the problem is that they could become 

00:06:17.310 --> 00:06:21.960
 authentic exterminators of all 

00:06:19.410 --> 00:06:24.300
 cellular organisms reaching to finish 

00:06:21.960 --> 00:06:26.709
 in a single night with all life 

00:06:24.300 --> 00:06:29.389
 organic 

00:06:26.709 --> 00:06:31.639
 Eric Trex read one of the parents 

00:06:29.389 --> 00:06:33.849
 founders of the nanotechnology concept 

00:06:31.639 --> 00:06:35.779
 has presented several theories 

00:06:33.849 --> 00:06:39.349
 chilling about the day of the trial 

00:06:35.779 --> 00:06:41.199
 end for example a known scenario 

00:06:39.349 --> 00:06:43.879
 like the gray plague problem 

00:06:41.199 --> 00:06:46.399
 suggests that the robots to the car 

00:06:43.879 --> 00:06:48.860
 reproduce would consume all the 

00:06:46.399 --> 00:06:51.679
 material available on the planet together 

00:06:48.860 --> 00:06:54.199
 with the earth itself the result of 

00:06:51.679 --> 00:06:57.289
 this process would be that a gray mass 

00:06:54.199 --> 00:07:00.380
 formed of nano robots would end up floating 

00:06:57.289 --> 00:07:03.290
 drifting in space 

00:07:00.380 --> 00:07:05.870
 meanwhile the scientists inform 

00:07:03.290 --> 00:07:09.110
 that they are working on a robot monkey 

00:07:05.870 --> 00:07:12.080
 reproduce a kind of queen bee ' 

00:07:09.110 --> 00:07:14.690
 of the monkeys robots capable of producing 

00:07:12.080 --> 00:07:19.270
 billions of tiny machines 

00:07:14.690 --> 00:07:19.270
 and able to control them 

00:07:19.639 --> 00:07:23.930
 ah 

00:07:21.700 --> 00:07:26.540
 this has been the five experiments 

00:07:23.930 --> 00:07:29.500
 scientists that could put an end to 

00:07:26.540 --> 00:07:29.500
 our existence
