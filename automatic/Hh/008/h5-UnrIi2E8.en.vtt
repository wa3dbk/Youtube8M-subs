00:00:09.019 --> 00:00:14.119
 now we have another advice very 

00:00:11.179 --> 00:00:17.660
 important to keep moving forward in the 

00:00:14.119 --> 00:00:19.669
 path of a healthy life and it is to 

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:22.360
 through the portions like us 

00:00:19.669 --> 00:00:25.610
 we can have a better quality of life 

00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:27.980
 First, I'll show you how 

00:00:25.610 --> 00:00:31.629
 the hand wherever you walk you can 

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:35.780
 know how much you're eating first 

00:00:31.629 --> 00:00:38.449
 we see our index finger our finger 

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:41.270
 thumb will help us to know 

00:00:38.449 --> 00:00:44.270
 how much is a portion for example 

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:47.480
 our index finger in the final part 

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:51.890
 of the knuckle this means a 

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:55.420
 teaspoon and this thumb is going to 

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:59.720
 say a spoonful for example 

00:00:55.420 --> 00:01:03.159
 teaspoon would be butter mayonnaise and 

00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:06.469
 also oil for a spoonful 

00:01:03.159 --> 00:01:09.350
 let's take for example the water cac 

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:12.170
 tina the peanut butter and we see that 

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:16.539
 only in the last part of the minute 

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:16.539
 This is going to be a portion 

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:22.820
 something very important also if we 

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:26.570
 we close our hand this gives us more or 

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:30.380
 less so that you can know more about 

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:33.230
 same portion that would be from a cup here 

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:37.250
 we have the small fruits that can 

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:40.220
 measure yourself with a cup we see here the 

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:43.760
 blackberries raspberries strawberries the 

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:47.240
 we put in a cup the same thing would be for 

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:50.480
 the big fruits that are the papaya the 

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:54.190
 watermelon and the melon here we have also 

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:59.000
 a cup that would be our fist closed 

00:01:54.190 --> 00:02:03.320
 if we are going to talk about medium fruits a 

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:07.240
 portion would be an apple a pear a 

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:10.420
 peach or a banana 

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:15.370
 if we are going to talk about vegetables no longer 

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:19.090
 is a cup are going to be two cups that 

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:21.760
 we have here this time we put 

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:25.100
 spinach but it can also be lettuce 

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:27.860
 carrot or combined broccoli 

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:31.100
 I also want to show you how much is the 

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:34.490
 portion to consume protein if 

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:38.180
 we see with the hand thus extended all 

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:40.640
 this part gives us 90 grams 90 grams 

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:44.120
 it would be with this part that is what 

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:47.960
 we here about a half cup 

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:52.480
 cooked beans or a third cup if 

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:55.000
 It is raw as we have them here 

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:58.150
 in the case of soy products also 

00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:01.370
 are 90 grams and we already said what 

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:04.840
 fits in the palm of your hand 

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:07.849
 we also have for example here 

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:10.870
 oil seeds that give us a lot 

00:03:07.849 --> 00:03:15.019
 energy many vitamins of complex b 

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:17.750
 zinc iron calcium and magnesium but 

00:03:15.019 --> 00:03:21.140
 we must take care of the portions that 

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:24.349
 we consume if we with our hand 

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:28.629
 we closed the fist a little only in the 

00:03:24.349 --> 00:03:31.459
 Deep part I'm going to get 30 grams 

00:03:28.629 --> 00:03:36.109
 only 30 grams that's why some 

00:03:31.459 --> 00:03:38.329
 people say 8 10 or 12 pieces of 

00:03:36.109 --> 00:03:41.180
 some of these products but I do not know 

00:03:38.329 --> 00:03:43.790
 worry only that you support your hand 

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:46.579
 what fits in the bottom only 

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:47.810
 that's what I should consume in a 

00:03:46.579 --> 00:03:52.250
 day 

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:54.560
 we have here the group of cereals and 

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:57.860
 the oatmeal that is very common to consume 

00:03:54.560 --> 00:04:01.730
 let's go to the serving is a cup but 

00:03:57.860 --> 00:04:03.310
 when it is dry it would be a third of 

00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:07.720
 Cup 

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:09.040
 more or less than 2 to 3 tablespoons like 

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:11.709
 is 

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:15.609
 if we talk about bread here it's very easy 

00:04:11.709 --> 00:04:18.519
 because it's just a slice I hope 

00:04:15.609 --> 00:04:20.769
 that we have learned more about the 

00:04:18.519 --> 00:04:24.370
 portions and that we can soon 

00:04:20.769 --> 00:04:27.400
 include in our diet our plan 

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:30.330
 diet to be able to have a diet 

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:30.330
 more balanced
