war machine and ultra killing pretty
awesome<00:01:46.560> and<00:01:47.010> then<00:01:47.160> when<00:01:47.310> building<00:01:47.550> LEGO<00:01:47.850> sets

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:48.120 
awesome and then when building LEGO sets

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:50.570 
awesome and then when building LEGO sets
I<00:01:48.330> like<00:01:48.570> to<00:01:48.810> to<00:01:49.230> make<00:01:49.320> it<00:01:49.440> easier<00:01:49.740> I<00:01:49.950> like<00:01:50.430> to

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:50.580 
I like to to make it easier I like to

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:52.910 
I like to to make it easier I like to
separate<00:01:50.970> the<00:01:51.030> pieces<00:01:51.600> and<00:01:51.900> colors<00:01:52.230> that

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920 
separate the pieces and colors that

00:01:52.920 --> 00:03:01.870 
separate the pieces and colors that
makes<00:01:53.160> it<00:01:53.280> a<00:01:53.340> lot<00:01:53.550> a<00:01:53.910> lot<00:01:54.630> easier

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:01.880 

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:03.860 

so<00:03:02.880> this<00:03:03.000> part<00:03:03.270> could<00:03:03.450> be<00:03:03.510> a<00:03:03.630> little<00:03:03.780> tricky

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:03.870 
so this part could be a little tricky

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:05.660 
so this part could be a little tricky
you<00:03:04.440> built<00:03:04.800> this<00:03:04.980> and<00:03:05.310> then<00:03:05.430> you<00:03:05.490> have<00:03:05.580> to

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:05.670 
you built this and then you have to

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:08.840 
you built this and then you have to
click<00:03:05.930> these<00:03:06.930> two<00:03:07.290> pieces<00:03:07.560> into<00:03:08.220> the<00:03:08.700> two

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:08.850 
click these two pieces into the two

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:40.490 
click these two pieces into the two
yellow<00:03:09.060> pieces<00:03:09.390> in<00:03:09.630> there<00:03:09.890> there<00:03:10.890> you<00:03:10.950> go<00:03:39.500> so

00:03:40.490 --> 00:03:40.500 
yellow pieces in there there you go so

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:41.840 
yellow pieces in there there you go so
once<00:03:40.739> you've<00:03:40.920> assembled<00:03:41.250> these<00:03:41.550> little

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:41.850 
once you've assembled these little
