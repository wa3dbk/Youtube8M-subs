00:00:01.989 --> 00:00:05.050 

today's<00:00:02.989> question<00:00:03.469> has<00:00:03.800> to<00:00:03.980> do<00:00:04.130> with<00:00:04.310> when<00:00:04.939> you

00:00:05.050 --> 00:00:05.060 
today's question has to do with when you

00:00:05.060 --> 00:00:07.360 
today's question has to do with when you
vibrate<00:00:05.300> the<00:00:05.839> movement<00:00:06.319> it<00:00:06.410> makes<00:00:06.680> and<00:00:06.950> how<00:00:07.220> it

00:00:07.360 --> 00:00:07.370 
vibrate the movement it makes and how it

00:00:07.370 --> 00:00:09.640 
vibrate the movement it makes and how it
affects<00:00:07.670> your<00:00:07.790> plane<00:00:08.090> the<00:00:08.960> violin<00:00:09.350> moving

00:00:09.640 --> 00:00:09.650 
affects your plane the violin moving

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:11.230 
affects your plane the violin moving
back<00:00:09.799> and<00:00:09.949> forth<00:00:10.190> let's<00:00:10.580> hear<00:00:10.760> the<00:00:10.879> question

00:00:11.230 --> 00:00:11.240 
back and forth let's hear the question

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:13.359 
back and forth let's hear the question
and<00:00:11.360> then<00:00:11.420> we'll<00:00:11.510> talk<00:00:11.690> about<00:00:11.869> that<00:00:12.139> I<00:00:12.379> hear

00:00:13.359 --> 00:00:13.369 
and then we'll talk about that I hear

00:00:13.369 --> 00:00:16.180 
and then we'll talk about that I hear
how<00:00:13.610> are<00:00:13.760> you<00:00:13.940> I<00:00:14.840> didn't<00:00:15.469> want<00:00:15.590> to<00:00:15.680> ask<00:00:15.889> a

00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:16.190 
how are you I didn't want to ask a

00:00:16.190 --> 00:00:20.460 
how are you I didn't want to ask a
question<00:00:16.369> about<00:00:16.699> vibrato<00:00:17.510> and<00:00:18.550> Adam<00:00:19.550> the<00:00:19.670> bow

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:20.470 
question about vibrato and Adam the bow

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:23.800 
question about vibrato and Adam the bow
the<00:00:21.470> problem<00:00:21.860> is<00:00:22.010> that<00:00:22.250> every<00:00:23.150> time<00:00:23.300> I<00:00:23.360> want<00:00:23.720> to

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:23.810 
the problem is that every time I want to

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:28.210 
the problem is that every time I want to
vibrate<00:00:24.230> on<00:00:24.590> a<00:00:25.039> particular<00:00:25.789> note<00:00:26.920> my<00:00:27.920> sound

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:28.220 
vibrate on a particular note my sound

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:30.520 
vibrate on a particular note my sound
gets<00:00:28.460> affected<00:00:29.000> a<00:00:29.060> little<00:00:29.360> bit<00:00:29.539> maybe<00:00:30.350> it's

00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:30.530 
gets affected a little bit maybe it's

00:00:30.530 --> 00:00:33.810 
gets affected a little bit maybe it's
because<00:00:31.390> when<00:00:32.390> on<00:00:32.539> lawns<00:00:32.780> in<00:00:33.050> the<00:00:33.140> vibrato

00:00:33.810 --> 00:00:33.820 
because when on lawns in the vibrato

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:38.700 
because when on lawns in the vibrato
maybe<00:00:34.820> I<00:00:35.150> pull<00:00:35.710> too<00:00:36.710> hard<00:00:36.739> on<00:00:37.610> the<00:00:37.700> violin<00:00:38.120> and

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:38.710 
maybe I pull too hard on the violin and

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:41.170 
maybe I pull too hard on the violin and
that<00:00:39.710> causes<00:00:40.070> the<00:00:40.190> boat<00:00:40.399> to<00:00:40.550> balance<00:00:40.970> a<00:00:41.060> little

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:41.180 
that causes the boat to balance a little

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:45.520 
that causes the boat to balance a little
bit<00:00:42.520> or<00:00:43.520> maybe<00:00:43.910> my<00:00:44.420> hand<00:00:44.720> is<00:00:44.840> not<00:00:44.989> going<00:00:45.050> really

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:45.530 
bit or maybe my hand is not going really

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:47.560 
bit or maybe my hand is not going really
straight<00:00:45.860> while<00:00:46.100> concentrating<00:00:46.730> I'm<00:00:47.239> doing

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:47.570 
straight while concentrating I'm doing

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:50.940 
straight while concentrating I'm doing
this<00:00:47.720> motion<00:00:48.020> it's<00:00:49.090> it<00:00:50.090> gets<00:00:50.239> really<00:00:50.510> really

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:50.950 
this motion it's it gets really really

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:53.080 
this motion it's it gets really really
difficult<00:00:51.950> to<00:00:52.010> coordinate<00:00:52.280> books<00:00:52.670> bump

00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:53.090 
difficult to coordinate books bump

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:56.020 
difficult to coordinate books bump
things<00:00:53.329> at<00:00:53.480> the<00:00:53.600> same<00:00:53.809> time<00:00:54.050> so<00:00:54.350> I<00:00:55.309> want<00:00:55.730> to<00:00:55.760> ask

00:00:56.020 --> 00:00:56.030 
things at the same time so I want to ask

00:00:56.030 --> 00:00:58.900 
things at the same time so I want to ask
you<00:00:56.390> if<00:00:57.320> you<00:00:57.500> have<00:00:57.649> any<00:00:57.829> recommendations<00:00:58.700> on

00:00:58.900 --> 00:00:58.910 
you if you have any recommendations on

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:01.630 
you if you have any recommendations on
how<00:00:58.940> can<00:00:59.239> I<00:00:59.510> work<00:00:59.750> on<00:00:59.960> this<00:01:00.140> matter<00:01:00.829> so<00:01:01.280> I<00:01:01.309> can

00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:01.640 
how can I work on this matter so I can

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:04.719 
how can I work on this matter so I can
get<00:01:01.790> a<00:01:01.820> clean<00:01:02.210> sound<00:01:02.680> vibrating<00:01:03.680> thank<00:01:04.519> you

00:01:04.719 --> 00:01:04.729 
get a clean sound vibrating thank you

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:07.179 
get a clean sound vibrating thank you
thank<00:01:05.689> you<00:01:05.749> one<00:01:06.079> I'm<00:01:06.350> doing<00:01:06.920> great

00:01:07.179 --> 00:01:07.189 
thank you one I'm doing great

thank you one I'm doing great
not<00:01:07.939> only<00:01:08.119> is<00:01:08.329> that<00:01:08.359> a<00:01:08.479> good<00:01:08.659> question<00:01:09.079> but

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:09.200 
not only is that a good question but

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:10.929 
not only is that a good question but
it's<00:01:09.319> the<00:01:09.380> same<00:01:09.649> question<00:01:10.009> that<00:01:10.340> I<00:01:10.429> had<00:01:10.639> for<00:01:10.670> my

00:01:10.929 --> 00:01:10.939 
it's the same question that I had for my

00:01:10.939 --> 00:01:13.599 
it's the same question that I had for my
teacher<00:01:11.209> when<00:01:11.929> I<00:01:11.990> was<00:01:12.200> a<00:01:12.229> kid<00:01:12.499> his<00:01:13.159> answer<00:01:13.579> to

00:01:13.599 --> 00:01:13.609 
teacher when I was a kid his answer to

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:15.699 
teacher when I was a kid his answer to
me<00:01:13.850> was<00:01:13.880> you<00:01:14.539> don't<00:01:14.869> need<00:01:15.109> to<00:01:15.319> worry<00:01:15.560> about

00:01:15.699 --> 00:01:15.709 
me was you don't need to worry about

00:01:15.709 --> 00:01:18.129 
me was you don't need to worry about
that<00:01:16.100> that<00:01:16.999> didn't<00:01:17.299> make<00:01:17.359> much<00:01:17.539> sense<00:01:17.779> to<00:01:17.929> me

00:01:18.129 --> 00:01:18.139 
that that didn't make much sense to me

00:01:18.139 --> 00:01:19.840 
that that didn't make much sense to me
back<00:01:18.350> then<00:01:18.619> and<00:01:18.829> it<00:01:19.219> probably<00:01:19.459> doesn't<00:01:19.609> make

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:19.850 
back then and it probably doesn't make

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:21.519 
back then and it probably doesn't make
much<00:01:20.060> sense<00:01:20.209> to<00:01:20.329> you<00:01:20.539> either<00:01:20.749> but<00:01:21.380> if<00:01:21.469> you

00:01:21.519 --> 00:01:21.529 
much sense to you either but if you

00:01:21.529 --> 00:01:24.190 
much sense to you either but if you
think<00:01:21.770> about<00:01:21.889> it<00:01:22.219> I<00:01:22.479> think<00:01:23.479> what<00:01:23.840> he<00:01:23.929> meant<00:01:24.139> to

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:24.200 
think about it I think what he meant to

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:26.319 
think about it I think what he meant to
say<00:01:24.259> was<00:01:24.409> go<00:01:24.920> with<00:01:25.069> the<00:01:25.159> flow<00:01:25.399> when<00:01:26.270> you

00:01:26.319 --> 00:01:26.329 
say was go with the flow when you

00:01:26.329 --> 00:01:29.830 
say was go with the flow when you
vibrate<00:01:26.659> you're<00:01:27.439> making<00:01:27.950> a<00:01:28.159> movement<00:01:28.520> yes<00:01:29.179> but

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:29.840 
vibrate you're making a movement yes but

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:31.179 
vibrate you're making a movement yes but
you're<00:01:29.990> also<00:01:30.109> changing<00:01:30.709> the<00:01:30.829> pitch<00:01:31.039> you're

00:01:31.179 --> 00:01:31.189 
you're also changing the pitch you're

00:01:31.189 --> 00:01:32.769 
you're also changing the pitch you're
going<00:01:31.369> up<00:01:31.549> and<00:01:31.729> down<00:01:31.819> with<00:01:31.999> a<00:01:32.060> pitch<00:01:32.270> you<00:01:32.749> have

00:01:32.769 --> 00:01:32.779 
going up and down with a pitch you have

00:01:32.779 --> 00:01:34.839 
going up and down with a pitch you have
a<00:01:32.899> choice<00:01:33.200> you<00:01:33.529> can<00:01:33.709> clench<00:01:34.159> on<00:01:34.340> the<00:01:34.429> violin<00:01:34.759> a

00:01:34.839 --> 00:01:34.849 
a choice you can clench on the violin a

00:01:34.849 --> 00:01:37.059 
a choice you can clench on the violin a
little<00:01:35.090> bit<00:01:35.209> to<00:01:35.389> keep<00:01:35.539> your<00:01:35.740> steady<00:01:36.740> or<00:01:36.979> you

00:01:37.059 --> 00:01:37.069 
little bit to keep your steady or you

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:39.210 
little bit to keep your steady or you
can<00:01:37.189> let<00:01:37.279> the<00:01:37.369> body<00:01:37.549> go

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:39.220 
can let the body go

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:41.370 
can let the body go
if<00:01:39.579> you<00:01:39.759> let<00:01:39.909> the<00:01:40.000> violin<00:01:40.299> go<00:01:40.479> yeah<00:01:41.110> there'll

00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:41.380 
if you let the violin go yeah there'll

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:42.749 
if you let the violin go yeah there'll
be<00:01:41.409> a<00:01:41.530> movement<00:01:41.799> that<00:01:42.040> you<00:01:42.250> can<00:01:42.399> actually<00:01:42.520> hear

00:01:42.749 --> 00:01:42.759 
be a movement that you can actually hear

00:01:42.759 --> 00:01:44.310 
be a movement that you can actually hear
in<00:01:42.880> a<00:01:42.939> boat<00:01:43.119> but<00:01:43.659> that<00:01:43.780> movement<00:01:44.020> will<00:01:44.290> be

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:44.320 
in a boat but that movement will be

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:46.620 
in a boat but that movement will be
rhythmical<00:01:45.009> together<00:01:45.790> with<00:01:46.090> the<00:01:46.210> same<00:01:46.420> rhythm

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:46.630 
rhythmical together with the same rhythm

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:49.050 
rhythmical together with the same rhythm
that<00:01:46.930> comes<00:01:47.140> from<00:01:47.619> vibrating<00:01:48.159> in<00:01:48.729> other<00:01:48.909> words

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:49.060 
that comes from vibrating in other words

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:50.940 
that comes from vibrating in other words
the<00:01:49.180> pulse<00:01:49.420> is<00:01:49.659> the<00:01:49.750> same<00:01:49.990> the<00:01:50.409> speed<00:01:50.710> is<00:01:50.830> the

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:50.950 
the pulse is the same the speed is the

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:54.569 
the pulse is the same the speed is the
same<00:01:52.380> doesn't<00:01:53.380> matter<00:01:53.590> that<00:01:53.920> you<00:01:54.189> can<00:01:54.340> hear

00:01:54.569 --> 00:01:54.579 
same doesn't matter that you can hear

following the waves of your vibrato now

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:01.139 
following the waves of your vibrato now
all<00:01:59.740> of<00:02:00.039> this<00:02:00.130> is<00:02:00.310> relative<00:02:00.759> you<00:02:00.789> can<00:02:01.030> vibrate

00:02:01.139 --> 00:02:01.149 
all of this is relative you can vibrate

00:02:01.149 --> 00:02:05.120 
all of this is relative you can vibrate
just<00:02:01.600> a<00:02:01.689> little<00:02:01.960> bit<00:02:03.149> you<00:02:04.149> can<00:02:04.299> vibrate<00:02:04.450> more

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:05.130 
just a little bit you can vibrate more

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:08.339 
just a little bit you can vibrate more
and<00:02:06.360> the<00:02:07.360> more<00:02:07.539> you<00:02:07.600> vibrate<00:02:08.019> the<00:02:08.170> more

00:02:08.339 --> 00:02:08.349 
and the more you vibrate the more

00:02:08.349 --> 00:02:10.550 
and the more you vibrate the more
movement<00:02:08.530> they'll<00:02:08.739> be<00:02:08.920> which<00:02:09.250> means<00:02:09.489> the<00:02:10.090> more

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:10.560 
movement they'll be which means the more

flexibility in your hand okay that's

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:27.240 
flexibility in your hand okay that's
something<00:02:25.090> you<00:02:25.209> can<00:02:25.390> work<00:02:25.540> on<00:02:25.890> your<00:02:26.890> vibrato

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:27.250 
something you can work on your vibrato

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:28.410 
something you can work on your vibrato
by<00:02:27.459> the<00:02:27.519> way<00:02:27.640> it<00:02:27.700> looks<00:02:27.850> really<00:02:28.150> good<00:02:28.269> the

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:28.420 
by the way it looks really good the

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:30.449 
by the way it looks really good the
motion<00:02:28.900> in<00:02:29.049> your<00:02:29.140> hand<00:02:29.500> the<00:02:29.769> rocking<00:02:30.190> back<00:02:30.430> and

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:32.490 
forth
looks<00:02:31.239> very<00:02:31.330> steady<00:02:31.840> and<00:02:32.019> I<00:02:32.110> didn't<00:02:32.319> see<00:02:32.410> your

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:32.500 
looks very steady and I didn't see your

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:34.110 
looks very steady and I didn't see your
violin<00:02:32.860> move<00:02:33.010> very<00:02:33.190> much<00:02:33.340> either<00:02:33.519> which<00:02:33.970> is

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:34.120 
violin move very much either which is

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:35.820 
violin move very much either which is
great<00:02:34.390> there<00:02:34.930> are<00:02:34.989> two<00:02:35.200> kinds<00:02:35.560> of<00:02:35.650> move

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:35.830 
great there are two kinds of move

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:37.920 
great there are two kinds of move
ministers<00:02:36.310> one<00:02:36.910> is<00:02:37.090> negative<00:02:37.480> it's<00:02:37.690> this

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:37.930 
ministers one is negative it's this

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:39.570 
ministers one is negative it's this
movement<00:02:38.170> up<00:02:38.410> and<00:02:38.650> down<00:02:38.739> reason<00:02:39.459> this

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:39.580 
movement up and down reason this

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:41.640 
movement up and down reason this
negative<00:02:40.030> is<00:02:40.120> because<00:02:40.239> bow<00:02:40.870> becomes<00:02:41.170> heavy<00:02:41.470> as

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:41.650 
negative is because bow becomes heavy as

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:43.319 
negative is because bow becomes heavy as
you<00:02:41.769> go<00:02:41.890> down<00:02:42.069> and<00:02:42.310> it<00:02:42.730> becomes<00:02:42.970> light<00:02:43.150> as<00:02:43.269> you

00:02:43.319 --> 00:02:43.329 
you go down and it becomes light as you

00:02:43.329 --> 00:02:46.460 
you go down and it becomes light as you
go<00:02:43.480> up<00:02:43.510> gravity<00:02:44.500> is<00:02:44.590> working<00:02:44.769> against<00:02:45.310> you<00:02:45.459> so

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:46.470 
go up gravity is working against you so

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:50.280 
go up gravity is working against you so
if<00:02:47.470> you<00:02:47.709> can<00:02:48.120> counteract<00:02:49.120> jumping<00:02:50.049> up<00:02:50.170> and

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:50.290 
if you can counteract jumping up and

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:52.349 
if you can counteract jumping up and
down<00:02:50.380> you<00:02:51.220> can<00:02:51.340> even<00:02:51.459> practice<00:02:51.700> if<00:02:52.060> you<00:02:52.150> like

00:02:52.349 --> 00:02:52.359 
down you can even practice if you like

00:02:52.359 --> 00:02:55.440 
down you can even practice if you like
then<00:02:52.959> you<00:02:53.230> can<00:02:53.380> accomplish<00:02:53.799> just<00:02:54.220> about<00:02:54.519> you

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:55.450 
then you can accomplish just about you

00:03:09.479 --> 00:03:09.489 
finger flexibility than wrist

00:03:09.489 --> 00:03:11.880 
finger flexibility than wrist
flexibility<00:03:10.209> because<00:03:10.359> the<00:03:10.989> the<00:03:11.410> wrist<00:03:11.650> is

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:11.890 
flexibility because the the wrist is

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:14.729 
flexibility because the the wrist is
kind<00:03:12.160> of<00:03:12.340> out<00:03:12.519> of<00:03:12.579> control<00:03:12.880> if<00:03:13.480> you<00:03:13.870> as<00:03:14.470> you
