00:00:32.269 --> 00:00:37.370

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:56.170
 from teacher mercedes lopez who together 

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:58.900
 these beautiful kids will give us 

00:00:56.170 --> 00:01:00.430
 a lesson in how they face the 

00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:02.680
 life of course in his kind of 

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:05.550
 activities of daily life so 

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:05.550
 accompany 

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:17.810
 in the dining room we work everything that is 

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:19.729
 the kitchen utensils like sitting 

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:21.979
 correctly how to use the 

00:01:19.729 --> 00:01:23.990
 covered because then check the area 

00:01:21.979 --> 00:01:26.719
 of the good spare right now we are in 

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:30.470
 the kitchen area where Miguel goes to 

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:32.780
 teach us how to light a stove 

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:35.649
 knows exactly the recommendations to 

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:38.780
 start he has to take out the match 

00:01:35.649 --> 00:01:40.520
 close the little bag because he knows that 

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:43.159
 can turn on everything at any time 

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:44.750
 the rest then with the index and thumb 

00:01:43.159 --> 00:01:47.320
 grab the match and with the little finger 

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:50.550
 locate where the burner is 

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:50.550
 but it has 

00:01:51.730 --> 00:01:56.470
 you have to remember that the flavor touches you 

00:01:54.610 --> 00:02:00.540
 of lemon but notice that it is like 

00:01:56.470 --> 00:02:00.540
 Same job as jelly pineapple 

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:05.170
 the motivation to fend for himself 

00:02:03.549 --> 00:02:07.479
 it means that the little ones demonstrate 

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:09.640
 enthusiasm and dedication in their studies 

00:02:07.479 --> 00:02:12.430
 students receive writing classes 

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:14.530
 braille and computing exercise between 

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:17.140
 others and the little ones to meet 

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:19.660
 through touch and others of sound 

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:21.730
 figures of life a great example of 

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:24.040
 struggle that despite its limitations by 

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:25.989
 very serious that there are no barriers 

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:27.940
 so that they meet their goals under the 

00:02:25.989 --> 00:02:31.209
 inspiration from those who teach them 

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:34.180
