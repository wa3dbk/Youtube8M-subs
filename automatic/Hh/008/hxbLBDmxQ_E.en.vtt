00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.899
 very good throughout a series of 

00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:06.210
 videos I will teach you when raising worms 

00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:07.890
 silk at home this activity is very 

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:09.780
 good to carry it out with children 

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:12.179
 because they learn values about respect 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:14.700
 to nature to be responsible and 

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:16.830
 careful also during a short 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:18.470
 season is a daily experience in 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:22.300
 the one they learn to use words like 

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:24.009
 metamorphosis larva chrysalis and mulberry 

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:26.259
 to start this new hobby are 

00:00:24.009 --> 00:00:29.220
 necessary very few things we will give you 

00:00:26.259 --> 00:00:32.050
 to procure a box or container 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:34.000
 preferably cardboard with a lid and 

00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:36.790
 we will make some holes for you 

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:39.010
 have ventilation we should have a 

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:41.530
 Moreda plant nearby or live near 

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:42.879
 some and obviously get eggs in my 

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:46.059
 case I have to thank you 

00:00:42.879 --> 00:00:48.160
 javier or roast in info garden which I 

00:00:46.059 --> 00:00:50.170
 has provided these eggs 

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:53.110
 we have to keep in mind that these 

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:56.200
 tiny little worms will measure adults 

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:57.820
 about 7 centimeters more or less color by 

00:00:56.200 --> 00:01:00.400
 therefore we will have to look for a box 

00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:02.530
 adequate to the number of worms I have 

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:05.050
 four folios like these so I'll have 

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:08.250
 about three or four boxes and the 

00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:08.250
 Sorting is according to the variety 

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:14.530
 in the video I 'm going to show you the eggs 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:16.540
 the dow and is dedicated to eggs and how 

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:19.990
 distinguish those that are worth each not each 

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:23.380
 Egg measures approximately between 11 and 13 

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:26.700
 millimeter is flattened oval and color 

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:26.700
 indicates its status 

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:33.200
 it is very easy to see the state in which 

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:35.140
 find for example if it is dark as 

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:37.450
 the case of these 

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:39.820
 that the larva are still quite dark 

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:41.979
 is still developing or lethargy if 

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:45.230
 it changes to a clearer green like 

00:01:41.979 --> 00:01:47.660
 we can see in this case from here 

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:50.210
 means that hatching is imminent 

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:52.560
 in a matter of days a larva will come out 

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:57.090
 little girl 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:59.250
 and if it is yellow or white that also 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:59.700
 we have in this tray perfect for 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:02.729
 see them 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:04.649
 it may be unusable or that 

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:06.500
 the worm has already left or it was not 

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:08.929
 fertilized 

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:10.970
 normal is that by the end of March or 

00:02:08.929 --> 00:02:13.580
 media depends on where you live with the 

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:15.500
 heat these eggs come alive every 

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:18.530
 egg is transformed into a black worm 

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:20.660
 very small kid with 16 legs that 

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:22.580
 immediately begins to eat born with a 

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:25.040
 voracious instinct what makes that in few 

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:27.050
 days acquire bigger size so 

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:29.180
 monitor the color of your eggs and in 

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:30.380
 how much do you see changes have prepared 

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:32.900
 Mulberry 

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:34.610
 in the next episode we will talk about the 

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:37.040
 food and basic care 

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:39.920
 I hope you find it useful to continue 

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:42.160
 this miniseries and see you in the next 

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:42.160
 video 

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:47.330
 do not
