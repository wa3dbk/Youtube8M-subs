orange<00:00:59.559> smoke<00:01:00.180> the<00:01:01.180> way<00:01:01.299> we<00:01:01.420> set<00:01:01.600> it<00:01:01.750> up<00:01:01.900> is

00:01:02.189 --> 00:01:02.199

well first of all you have to look at

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:05.399 
well first of all you have to look at
the<00:01:04.479> instructions<00:01:04.960> because<00:01:05.080> they're<00:01:05.290> all

00:01:05.399 --> 00:01:05.409 
the instructions because they're all

00:01:05.409 --> 00:01:07.080 
the instructions because they're all
slightly<00:01:05.680> different<00:01:05.860> I'll<00:01:06.700> talk<00:01:06.940> you<00:01:06.970> through

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:07.090 
slightly different I'll talk you through

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:09.690 
slightly different I'll talk you through
this<00:01:07.390> particular<00:01:07.600> one<00:01:08.080> is<00:01:08.860> we<00:01:09.189> take<00:01:09.400> the<00:01:09.490> top

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:09.700 
this particular one is we take the top

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:12.450 
this particular one is we take the top
off<00:01:09.850> then<00:01:10.780> we've<00:01:10.930> got<00:01:11.170> a<00:01:11.500> ring<00:01:11.799> pull<00:01:12.040> at<00:01:12.159> top

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:12.460 
off then we've got a ring pull at top

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:15.960 
off then we've got a ring pull at top
you<00:01:13.060> pull<00:01:13.330> that<00:01:13.510> off<00:01:13.570> the<00:01:13.869> top<00:01:14.140> and<00:01:14.820> then<00:01:15.820> this

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:15.970 
you pull that off the top and then this

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:18.690 
you pull that off the top and then this
particular<00:01:16.330> one<00:01:16.690> is<00:01:16.870> over<00:01:17.080> to<00:01:17.590> boyens<00:01:17.950> one<00:01:18.190> so

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:18.700 
particular one is over to boyens one so

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:20.460 
particular one is over to boyens one so
we<00:01:18.820> were<00:01:18.940> throwing<00:01:19.240> into<00:01:19.720> the<00:01:19.750> water

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:20.470 
we were throwing into the water

00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:22.500 
we were throwing into the water
downwind<00:01:20.980> and<00:01:21.250> that<00:01:21.820> would<00:01:21.910> make<00:01:22.060> a<00:01:22.120> cloud<00:01:22.480> of

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:22.510 
downwind and that would make a cloud of

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:24.900 
downwind and that would make a cloud of
orange<00:01:22.930> smoke<00:01:23.260> for<00:01:23.590> about<00:01:23.620> three<00:01:24.430> minutes<00:01:24.610> or

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:24.910 
orange smoke for about three minutes or

00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:27.450 
orange smoke for about three minutes or
so<00:01:25.060> this<00:01:25.900> is<00:01:26.110> a<00:01:26.140> this<00:01:26.830> would<00:01:27.010> be<00:01:27.100> good<00:01:27.280> to<00:01:27.430> use

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:27.460 
so this is a this would be good to use

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:30.300 
so this is a this would be good to use
in<00:01:28.240> in<00:01:28.600> daytime<00:01:29.170> when<00:01:29.620> you're<00:01:29.770> in<00:01:29.860> sight<00:01:30.130> of

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:30.310 
in in daytime when you're in sight of

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:35.400 
in in daytime when you're in sight of
rescue<00:01:33.120> the<00:01:34.120> next<00:01:34.510> type<00:01:34.720> of<00:01:34.750> where<00:01:35.050> we've<00:01:35.230> got

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:35.410 
rescue the next type of where we've got

00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:38.940 
rescue the next type of where we've got
is<00:01:35.650> a<00:01:36.070> is<00:01:36.880> a<00:01:36.940> red<00:01:37.240> hand<00:01:37.510> health<00:01:37.780> ler<00:01:38.080> and<00:01:38.560> what

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:38.950 
is a is a red hand health ler and what

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:40.980 
is a is a red hand health ler and what
this<00:01:39.100> does<00:01:39.310> once<00:01:39.580> it's<00:01:39.760> ignited<00:01:39.850> it<00:01:40.540> makes<00:01:40.780> her

00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:40.990 
this does once it's ignited it makes her

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:45.360 
this does once it's ignited it makes her
like<00:01:41.260> a<00:01:41.290> roman<00:01:41.770> candle<00:01:42.720> sort<00:01:43.720> of<00:01:43.900> Fleur

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:45.370 
like a roman candle sort of Fleur

00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:47.130 
like a roman candle sort of Fleur
again<00:01:45.850> you<00:01:46.210> would<00:01:46.330> read<00:01:46.510> the<00:01:46.630> instructions

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:47.140 
again you would read the instructions

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:49.500 
again you would read the instructions
before<00:01:47.290> before<00:01:48.010> you<00:01:48.100> set<00:01:48.340> off<00:01:48.370> but<00:01:48.880> for<00:01:49.420> this

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:49.510 
before before you set off but for this

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:51.660 
before before you set off but for this
particular<00:01:49.690> one<00:01:50.050> you<00:01:50.140> pull<00:01:50.530> the<00:01:50.680> top<00:01:50.860> off<00:01:51.070> and

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:51.670 
particular one you pull the top off and

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:53.340 
particular one you pull the top off and
again<00:01:51.940> there's<00:01:52.150> a<00:01:52.210> ring<00:01:52.420> Pole<00:01:52.690> you'd<00:01:53.050> pull

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:53.350 
again there's a ring Pole you'd pull

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:55.320 
again there's a ring Pole you'd pull
that<00:01:53.560> and<00:01:53.920> then<00:01:54.610> what<00:01:54.760> you<00:01:54.850> need<00:01:54.940> to<00:01:55.060> do<00:01:55.180> is

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:55.330 
that and then what you need to do is

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:59.100 
that and then what you need to do is
hold<00:01:55.570> it<00:01:55.750> arm's<00:01:56.170> length<00:01:57.360> out<00:01:58.360> over<00:01:58.840> the<00:01:58.930> water

00:01:59.100 --> 00:01:59.110 
hold it arm's length out over the water

to follow it's a case of pulling the
bottom<00:02:59.109> and<00:02:59.470> then<00:03:00.069> there's<00:03:00.280> a<00:03:00.310> white<00:03:00.459> fob<00:03:00.819> you

bottom and then there's a white fob you

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:03.690 
bottom and then there's a white fob you
pull<00:03:01.599> that<00:03:01.750> down<00:03:01.810> and<00:03:02.349> then<00:03:03.189> to<00:03:03.459> actually

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:03.700 
pull that down and then to actually

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:05.369 
pull that down and then to actually
launch<00:03:04.090> it<00:03:04.329> you<00:03:04.480> have<00:03:04.599> to<00:03:04.720> push<00:03:04.930> this<00:03:05.109> wait<00:03:05.349> for

00:03:05.369 --> 00:03:05.379 
launch it you have to push this wait for

00:03:05.379 --> 00:03:08.940 
launch it you have to push this wait for
backup<00:03:06.659> you<00:03:07.659> got<00:03:07.840> two<00:03:07.959> nodes<00:03:08.230> it<00:03:08.650> actually

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:08.950 
backup you got two nodes it actually

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:10.830 
backup you got two nodes it actually
says<00:03:09.189> which<00:03:09.370> way<00:03:09.549> the<00:03:09.700> top<00:03:09.939> is<00:03:10.150> so<00:03:10.329> make<00:03:10.689> sure

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:10.840 
says which way the top is so make sure

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:12.379 
says which way the top is so make sure
you<00:03:10.930> get<00:03:11.049> that<00:03:11.200> the<00:03:11.349> weight<00:03:11.500> right<00:03:11.739> way<00:03:11.889> around

00:03:12.379 --> 00:03:12.389 
you get that the weight right way around

00:03:12.389 --> 00:03:16.080 
you get that the weight right way around
and<00:03:13.389> we<00:03:13.750> need<00:03:13.930> to<00:03:14.230> point<00:03:14.859> it<00:03:15.189> slightly

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:16.090 
and we need to point it slightly

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:19.559 
and we need to point it slightly
downwind<00:03:17.129> both<00:03:18.129> ends<00:03:18.519> away<00:03:18.760> from<00:03:19.030> you<00:03:19.209> don't

00:03:19.559 --> 00:03:19.569 
downwind both ends away from you don't

00:03:19.569 --> 00:03:21.000 
downwind both ends away from you don't
be<00:03:19.689> tensed<00:03:19.959> this<00:03:20.049> issue<00:03:20.319> to<00:03:20.530> it<00:03:20.590> like<00:03:20.829> that

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:21.010 
be tensed this issue to it like that

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:22.409 
be tensed this issue to it like that
because<00:03:21.250> they<00:03:21.609> have<00:03:21.730> been<00:03:21.909> known<00:03:22.090> to<00:03:22.120> backfire

00:03:22.409 --> 00:03:22.419 
because they have been known to backfire

00:03:22.419 --> 00:03:24.990 
because they have been known to backfire
sometimes<00:03:23.290> so<00:03:23.950> I'll<00:03:24.040> point<00:03:24.189> them<00:03:24.340> both<00:03:24.579> away

00:03:24.990 --> 00:03:25.000 
sometimes so I'll point them both away

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:26.909 
sometimes so I'll point them both away
and<00:03:25.569> make<00:03:25.810> sure<00:03:26.019> they're<00:03:26.260> gonna<00:03:26.379> hit<00:03:26.620> not

00:03:26.909 --> 00:03:26.919 
and make sure they're gonna hit not

00:03:26.919 --> 00:03:28.710 
and make sure they're gonna hit not
nothing<00:03:27.310> it<00:03:27.400> in<00:03:27.489> your<00:03:27.639> rigging<00:03:27.819> so<00:03:28.389> you<00:03:28.449> get

00:03:28.710 --> 00:03:28.720 
nothing it in your rigging so you get

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:30.180 
nothing it in your rigging so you get
right<00:03:28.900> on<00:03:29.079> the<00:03:29.139> back<00:03:29.290> corner<00:03:29.650> of<00:03:29.709> the<00:03:29.799> bolt<00:03:29.979> may

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:30.190 
right on the back corner of the bolt may

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:34.530 
right on the back corner of the bolt may
be<00:03:30.250> slightly<00:03:30.819> downwind<00:03:31.329> and<00:03:31.569> shoot<00:03:32.349> it<00:03:33.389> if<00:03:34.389> you

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:34.540 
be slightly downwind and shoot it if you

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:36.689 
be slightly downwind and shoot it if you
shoot<00:03:34.720> one<00:03:34.870> of<00:03:34.930> these<00:03:35.139> the<00:03:35.500> third<00:03:35.829> box<00:03:36.459> there

00:03:36.689 --> 00:03:36.699 
shoot one of these the third box there

00:03:36.699 --> 00:03:38.699 
shoot one of these the third box there
you<00:03:36.819> should<00:03:36.879> shoot<00:03:37.209> one<00:03:37.479> a<00:03:37.870> minute<00:03:38.229> later

00:03:38.699 --> 00:03:38.709 
you should shoot one a minute later

00:03:38.709 --> 00:03:41.309 
you should shoot one a minute later
just<00:03:39.519> so<00:03:39.729> it<00:03:40.030> kind<00:03:40.239> of<00:03:40.299> confirms<00:03:40.690> if<00:03:41.019> someone

00:03:41.309 --> 00:03:41.319 
just so it kind of confirms if someone

00:03:41.319 --> 00:03:43.140 
just so it kind of confirms if someone
kind<00:03:41.530> of<00:03:41.590> half<00:03:41.769> sees<00:03:42.129> it<00:03:42.400> just<00:03:42.609> as<00:03:42.699> it's<00:03:42.849> fallen

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:43.150 
kind of half sees it just as it's fallen

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:45.089 
kind of half sees it just as it's fallen
into<00:03:43.269> the<00:03:43.419> water<00:03:43.569> will<00:03:44.290> see<00:03:44.440> a<00:03:44.470> little<00:03:44.680> one<00:03:44.949> a

00:03:45.089 --> 00:03:45.099 
into the water will see a little one a

00:03:45.099 --> 00:03:47.069 
into the water will see a little one a
minute<00:03:45.370> later<00:03:45.579> and<00:03:46.000> that<00:03:46.479> should<00:03:46.659> confirm

00:03:47.069 --> 00:03:47.079 
minute later and that should confirm

just to identify which which boat you
are

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:19.570 
are

00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:24.210 
are
and<00:04:19.810> also<00:04:20.289> that<00:04:20.560> helps<00:04:20.979> with<00:04:22.830> it<00:04:23.830> helps

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:24.220 
and also that helps with it helps

00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:26.520 
and also that helps with it helps
identify<00:04:25.210> the<00:04:25.270> bolt<00:04:25.570> and<00:04:25.840> also<00:04:26.199> the<00:04:26.380> wind

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:26.530 
identify the bolt and also the wind

00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:30.610

direction<00:04:26.680> for<00:04:27.280> the<00:04:27.340> helicopter<00:04:27.909> to<00:04:27.940> approach

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:30.620 

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:33.469

the chart table seats so they're quite

00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:48.350 
the chart table seats so they're quite
easy<00:04:44.970> to<00:04:45.419> get<00:04:45.570> to<00:04:45.810> from<00:04:45.840> the<00:04:46.320> cockpit<00:04:46.830> and<00:04:47.400> also
