00:00:39.139 --> 00:00:39.149 
these techniques you might want to look

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:41.240 
these techniques you might want to look
at<00:00:39.270> some<00:00:39.450> of<00:00:39.480> our<00:00:39.660> earlier<00:00:40.110> tutorials<00:00:40.740> on<00:00:40.980> beer

portrait now as you can see I have

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:49.520 
portrait now as you can see I have
addressed<00:00:47.610> some<00:00:47.880> of<00:00:47.970> the<00:00:48.090> small<00:00:48.570> blemishes<00:00:49.290> on

addressed some of the small blemishes on
her<00:00:49.620> face<00:00:49.890> and<00:00:50.310> this<00:00:50.640> was<00:00:50.790> just<00:00:51.000> to<00:00:51.120> speed<00:00:51.360> up

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390 
her face and this was just to speed up

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:53.390 
her face and this was just to speed up
the<00:00:51.600> demo<00:00:51.960> but<00:00:52.350> this<00:00:52.530> is<00:00:52.680> a<00:00:52.710> very<00:00:52.980> important

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:53.400 
the demo but this is a very important

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:55.670 
the demo but this is a very important
step<00:00:53.579> because<00:00:53.940> when<00:00:54.600> you<00:00:54.720> are<00:00:54.750> doing<00:00:55.140> skin

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 
step because when you are doing skin

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:57.530 
step because when you are doing skin
softening<00:00:56.190> if<00:00:57.030> you<00:00:57.120> don't<00:00:57.300> have<00:00:57.420> the

00:00:57.530 --> 00:00:57.540 
softening if you don't have the

00:00:57.540 --> 00:00:59.180 
softening if you don't have the
blemishes<00:00:58.079> removed<00:00:58.470> they<00:00:58.920> may<00:00:59.130> be

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190 
blemishes removed they may be

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:00.800 
blemishes removed they may be
exaggerated<00:01:00.060> with<00:01:00.149> the<00:01:00.300> steps<00:01:00.540> that<00:01:00.690> we're

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:00.810 
exaggerated with the steps that we're

00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:02.690 
exaggerated with the steps that we're
going<00:01:00.930> to<00:01:01.079> be<00:01:01.170> doing<00:01:01.290> next<00:01:01.560> okay<00:01:02.430> let's<00:01:02.610> get

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:02.700 
going to be doing next okay let's get

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:04.609 
going to be doing next okay let's get
started<00:01:03.090> the<00:01:03.840> first<00:01:03.870> thing<00:01:04.140> that<00:01:04.290> we<00:01:04.379> need<00:01:04.500> to

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619 
started the first thing that we need to

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:06.649 
started the first thing that we need to
do<00:01:04.769> is<00:01:05.040> grab<00:01:05.309> our<00:01:05.460> background<00:01:05.939> and<00:01:06.060> drag<00:01:06.540> it

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659 
do is grab our background and drag it

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:09.050 
do is grab our background and drag it
down<00:01:06.689> to<00:01:06.810> our<00:01:07.049> new<00:01:07.530> layer<00:01:07.770> icon<00:01:08.070> and<00:01:08.490> as<00:01:08.939> you

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060 
down to our new layer icon and as you

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:10.670 
down to our new layer icon and as you
can<00:01:09.180> see<00:01:09.329> that<00:01:09.450> quickly<00:01:09.630> makes<00:01:09.960> a<00:01:10.079> copy<00:01:10.290> of<00:01:10.530> our

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 
can see that quickly makes a copy of our

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:12.950 
can see that quickly makes a copy of our
background<00:01:11.100> layer<00:01:11.420> the<00:01:12.420> next<00:01:12.659> thing<00:01:12.749> that<00:01:12.780> we

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 
background layer the next thing that we

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:15.679 
background layer the next thing that we
need<00:01:13.109> to<00:01:13.139> do<00:01:13.350> is<00:01:13.590> go<00:01:13.710> up<00:01:13.740> to<00:01:13.979> filter<00:01:14.270> blur<00:01:15.270> and

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689 
need to do is go up to filter blur and

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:18.610 
need to do is go up to filter blur and
then<00:01:16.200> surface<00:01:16.710> blur

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:18.620 
then surface blur

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:19.570 
then surface blur
there<00:01:18.890> are<00:01:18.950> a<00:01:18.980> couple<00:01:19.010> different<00:01:19.310> options

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:19.580 
there are a couple different options

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:22.000 
there are a couple different options
including<00:01:20.300> radius<00:01:20.690> and<00:01:20.900> threshold<00:01:21.020> you<00:01:21.980> can

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:22.010 
including radius and threshold you can

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:23.620 
including radius and threshold you can
play<00:01:22.280> with<00:01:22.460> these<00:01:22.640> but<00:01:23.150> you<00:01:23.240> just<00:01:23.390> want<00:01:23.570> to

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:23.630 
play with these but you just want to

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:25.330 
play with these but you just want to
make<00:01:23.720> sure<00:01:23.900> that<00:01:24.050> the<00:01:24.200> skin<00:01:24.440> looks<00:01:24.650> smooth<00:01:24.920> but

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:25.340 
make sure that the skin looks smooth but

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:27.280 
make sure that the skin looks smooth but
you<00:01:25.430> still<00:01:25.640> have<00:01:25.790> detail<00:01:26.270> I'm<00:01:27.080> going<00:01:27.230> to

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:27.290 
you still have detail I'm going to

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:36.510 
you still have detail I'm going to
select<00:01:27.440> okay

00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:36.520 

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:38.800 

okay<00:01:37.520> I'm<00:01:37.610> just<00:01:37.670> gonna<00:01:37.850> zoom<00:01:38.300> out<00:01:38.450> at<00:01:38.600> full

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:38.810 
okay I'm just gonna zoom out at full

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:40.750 
okay I'm just gonna zoom out at full
frame<00:01:39.140> and<00:01:39.770> as<00:01:39.890> you<00:01:40.010> can<00:01:40.130> see<00:01:40.190> the<00:01:40.520> surface

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:40.760 
frame and as you can see the surface

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:42.820 
frame and as you can see the surface
blur<00:01:41.150> has<00:01:41.270> been<00:01:41.480> applied<00:01:41.840> to<00:01:41.870> the<00:01:42.290> entire

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:42.830 
blur has been applied to the entire

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:45.160 
blur has been applied to the entire
photo<00:01:43.360> however<00:01:44.360> we<00:01:44.540> really<00:01:44.720> just<00:01:44.900> want<00:01:45.110> the

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:45.170 
photo however we really just want the

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:47.260 
photo however we really just want the
surface<00:01:45.830> blur<00:01:46.160> to<00:01:46.340> be<00:01:46.430> applied<00:01:46.700> to<00:01:46.880> the<00:01:47.000> skin

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:47.270 
surface blur to be applied to the skin

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:49.200 
surface blur to be applied to the skin
so<00:01:47.930> I'm<00:01:48.050> gonna<00:01:48.200> create<00:01:48.500> a<00:01:48.560> mask<00:01:48.830> which<00:01:49.130> will

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:49.210 
so I'm gonna create a mask which will

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:52.000 
so I'm gonna create a mask which will
conceal<00:01:50.210> the<00:01:50.480> surface<00:01:50.990> blur<00:01:51.230> and<00:01:51.440> then<00:01:51.860> we'll

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:52.010 
conceal the surface blur and then we'll

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:54.160 
conceal the surface blur and then we'll
use<00:01:52.340> a<00:01:52.370> paintbrush<00:01:52.790> just<00:01:53.060> to<00:01:53.330> reveal<00:01:53.720> that<00:01:53.960> in

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:54.170 
use a paintbrush just to reveal that in

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:56.110 
use a paintbrush just to reveal that in
the<00:01:54.350> skin<00:01:54.590> areas<00:01:54.890> so<00:01:55.670> the<00:01:55.790> first<00:01:55.970> thing<00:01:56.090> that

00:01:56.110 --> 00:01:56.120 
the skin areas so the first thing that

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:57.790 
the skin areas so the first thing that
we<00:01:56.300> need<00:01:56.420> to<00:01:56.540> do<00:01:56.690> is<00:01:56.810> go<00:01:56.960> down<00:01:57.080> to<00:01:57.140> our<00:01:57.290> masks

00:01:57.790 --> 00:01:57.800 
we need to do is go down to our masks

00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:00.340 
we need to do is go down to our masks
and<00:01:57.980> I'm<00:01:58.220> gonna<00:01:58.370> hold<00:01:58.670> option<00:01:58.970> or<00:01:59.540> Alt<00:02:00.080> on<00:02:00.230> a<00:02:00.290> PC

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:00.350 
and I'm gonna hold option or Alt on a PC

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:02.830 
and I'm gonna hold option or Alt on a PC
while<00:02:01.220> clicking<00:02:01.460> the<00:02:01.670> mask<00:02:01.880> and<00:02:02.480> as<00:02:02.600> you<00:02:02.690> can

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:02.840 
while clicking the mask and as you can

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:04.660 
while clicking the mask and as you can
see<00:02:03.020> that<00:02:03.200> fills<00:02:03.470> the<00:02:03.860> mask<00:02:04.040> in<00:02:04.280> with<00:02:04.430> black

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:04.670 
see that fills the mask in with black

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:07.690 
see that fills the mask in with black
which<00:02:05.210> is<00:02:05.390> going<00:02:05.600> to<00:02:05.840> conceal<00:02:06.560> the<00:02:06.890> surface

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:07.700 
which is going to conceal the surface

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:10.480 
which is going to conceal the surface
blur<00:02:07.940> that<00:02:08.119> we<00:02:08.240> did<00:02:08.480> apply<00:02:08.690> to<00:02:09.110> that<00:02:09.230> layer<00:02:09.490> the

00:02:10.480 --> 00:02:10.490 
blur that we did apply to that layer the

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:12.400 
blur that we did apply to that layer the
next<00:02:10.670> step<00:02:10.940> is<00:02:11.090> to<00:02:11.240> go<00:02:11.390> up<00:02:11.570> and<00:02:11.840> grab<00:02:11.930> our<00:02:12.170> brush

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:12.410 
next step is to go up and grab our brush

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:14.080 
next step is to go up and grab our brush
and<00:02:12.710> then<00:02:13.310> make<00:02:13.460> sure<00:02:13.610> that<00:02:13.730> we<00:02:13.850> have<00:02:13.970> the

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:14.090 
and then make sure that we have the

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:16.090 
and then make sure that we have the
white<00:02:14.240> brush<00:02:14.510> selected<00:02:15.050> and<00:02:15.230> now<00:02:15.770> we're<00:02:15.920> going

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:16.100 
white brush selected and now we're going

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:17.860 
white brush selected and now we're going
to<00:02:16.220> go<00:02:16.430> into<00:02:16.730> the<00:02:16.850> photo<00:02:17.120> and<00:02:17.450> we're<00:02:17.630> going<00:02:17.810> to

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:17.870 
to go into the photo and we're going to

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:20.800 
to go into the photo and we're going to
paint<00:02:18.140> back<00:02:18.410> some<00:02:18.920> of<00:02:19.010> that<00:02:19.100> surface<00:02:19.400> blur<00:02:19.810> now

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:20.810 
paint back some of that surface blur now

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:23.140 
paint back some of that surface blur now
I'm<00:02:20.930> just<00:02:21.080> going<00:02:21.290> to<00:02:21.350> go<00:02:22.280> in<00:02:22.430> and<00:02:22.640> just<00:02:22.790> sort<00:02:23.060> of

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:31.820 
we're going to conceal some of the

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:33.880 
we're going to conceal some of the
surface<00:02:32.480> blur<00:02:32.750> which<00:02:33.200> is<00:02:33.380> going<00:02:33.590> to<00:02:33.680> bring

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:33.890 
surface blur which is going to bring

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:36.640 
surface blur which is going to bring
back<00:02:34.070> some<00:02:34.370> of<00:02:34.400> that<00:02:34.490> detail<00:02:35.440> so<00:02:36.440> I'm<00:02:36.500> just

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:36.650 
back some of that detail so I'm just

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:37.720 
back some of that detail so I'm just
going<00:02:36.770> to<00:02:36.800> make<00:02:36.950> my<00:02:37.100> brush<00:02:37.370> a<00:02:37.400> little<00:02:37.610> bit

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:37.730 
going to make my brush a little bit

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:41.080 
going to make my brush a little bit
smaller

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:41.090 

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:42.699 

and<00:02:41.180> I'm<00:02:41.750> just<00:02:41.900> going<00:02:42.080> to<00:02:42.170> make<00:02:42.319> sure<00:02:42.379> that<00:02:42.530> I

00:02:42.699 --> 00:02:42.709 
and I'm just going to make sure that I

00:02:42.709 --> 00:02:44.830 
and I'm just going to make sure that I
have<00:02:42.890> black<00:02:43.190> selected<00:02:43.790> and<00:02:44.450> I'm<00:02:44.540> going<00:02:44.569> to<00:02:44.720> go

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:44.840 
have black selected and I'm going to go

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:48.670 
have black selected and I'm going to go
into<00:02:45.080> these<00:02:45.200> areas<00:02:45.830> like<00:02:46.340> the<00:02:46.489> eyes<00:02:46.730> and<00:02:47.680> the

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:48.680 
into these areas like the eyes and the

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:52.119 
into these areas like the eyes and the
mouth<00:02:48.860> and<00:02:49.310> the<00:02:50.050> eyebrows<00:02:51.050> and<00:02:51.530> I'm<00:02:51.950> just

00:02:52.119 --> 00:02:52.129 
mouth and the eyebrows and I'm just

00:02:52.129 --> 00:02:54.190 
mouth and the eyebrows and I'm just
going<00:02:52.370> to<00:02:52.430> conceal<00:02:53.239> these<00:02:53.450> areas<00:02:53.840> which<00:02:54.050> is

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:54.200 
going to conceal these areas which is

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:58.270 
going to conceal these areas which is
just<00:02:54.440> going<00:02:54.620> to<00:02:54.800> hide<00:02:55.670> the<00:02:55.879> surface<00:02:56.300> blur

00:02:58.270 --> 00:02:58.280 
just going to hide the surface blur

00:02:58.280 --> 00:02:59.320 
just going to hide the surface blur
and<00:02:58.370> I<00:02:58.430> think<00:02:58.640> that<00:02:58.730> looks<00:02:58.880> pretty<00:02:59.060> good<00:02:59.180> right

00:02:59.320 --> 00:02:59.330 
and I think that looks pretty good right

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:02.260 
and I think that looks pretty good right
there<00:02:59.890> the<00:03:00.890> next<00:03:01.160> step<00:03:01.340> is<00:03:01.550> to<00:03:01.790> make<00:03:02.210> a

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:02.270 
there the next step is to make a

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:04.330 
there the next step is to make a
duplicate<00:03:02.810> of<00:03:02.870> this<00:03:03.140> layer<00:03:03.200> so<00:03:04.100> I'm<00:03:04.160> just

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:04.340 
duplicate of this layer so I'm just

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:07.060 
duplicate of this layer so I'm just
going<00:03:04.520> to<00:03:04.580> drag<00:03:05.510> and<00:03:05.690> drop<00:03:05.750> the<00:03:06.350> layer<00:03:06.500> down<00:03:06.860> to

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:07.070 
going to drag and drop the layer down to

00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:10.570 
going to drag and drop the layer down to
my<00:03:07.190> new<00:03:07.370> layer<00:03:07.580> icon

00:03:10.570 --> 00:03:10.580 

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:12.310 

now<00:03:10.910> we<00:03:10.970> need<00:03:11.150> to<00:03:11.270> take<00:03:11.420> our<00:03:11.570> first<00:03:11.750> layer<00:03:12.050> and

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:12.320 
now we need to take our first layer and

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:14.470 
now we need to take our first layer and
we're<00:03:12.740> going<00:03:12.950> to<00:03:12.980> do<00:03:13.250> a<00:03:13.280> blending<00:03:13.730> mode<00:03:13.910> change

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:14.480 
we're going to do a blending mode change

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:16.720 
we're going to do a blending mode change
but<00:03:15.080> first<00:03:15.200> I'm<00:03:15.380> going<00:03:15.530> to<00:03:15.590> change<00:03:15.860> the<00:03:16.310> name

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:16.730 
but first I'm going to change the name

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:18.790 
but first I'm going to change the name
of<00:03:16.760> the<00:03:16.940> file<00:03:17.150> to<00:03:17.180> lighten<00:03:17.840> just<00:03:18.560> so<00:03:18.650> I<00:03:18.680> know

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:18.800 
of the file to lighten just so I know

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:22.300 
of the file to lighten just so I know
which<00:03:19.130> layer<00:03:19.760> is<00:03:19.790> which<00:03:20.200> so<00:03:21.200> to<00:03:21.770> this<00:03:21.920> layer

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:22.310 
which layer is which so to this layer

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:25.350 
which layer is which so to this layer
we're<00:03:22.580> going<00:03:22.610> to<00:03:22.910> apply<00:03:23.330> a<00:03:23.720> blending<00:03:24.260> mode<00:03:24.560> of

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:25.360 
we're going to apply a blending mode of

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:29.020 
we're going to apply a blending mode of
lighten<00:03:26.620> the<00:03:27.620> next<00:03:27.890> one<00:03:28.070> I'm<00:03:28.310> going<00:03:28.670> to<00:03:28.790> label

00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:29.030 
lighten the next one I'm going to label

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:30.990 
lighten the next one I'm going to label
darken

00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:31.000 
darken

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.510 
darken
and<00:03:31.090> we're<00:03:31.750> going<00:03:31.900> to<00:03:31.990> apply<00:03:32.230> a<00:03:32.740> darkened

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:33.520 
and we're going to apply a darkened

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:36.240 
and we're going to apply a darkened
blend<00:03:33.760> mode<00:03:33.970> to<00:03:34.210> this<00:03:34.360> layer

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:36.250 
blend mode to this layer

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:37.980 
blend mode to this layer
now<00:03:36.460> we're<00:03:36.610> going<00:03:36.820> to<00:03:36.910> hide<00:03:37.420> the<00:03:37.600> darkened

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:37.990 
now we're going to hide the darkened

00:03:37.990 --> 00:03:40.110 
now we're going to hide the darkened
layer<00:03:38.140> and<00:03:38.470> make<00:03:39.250> sure<00:03:39.430> that<00:03:39.580> we<00:03:39.700> have<00:03:39.910> our

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:40.120 
layer and make sure that we have our

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:47.800 
bring up our levels and I'm just going

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:49.650 
bring up our levels and I'm just going
to<00:03:47.860> zoom<00:03:48.070> in<00:03:48.190> a<00:03:48.280> little<00:03:48.370> tighter<00:03:48.790> and<00:03:49.090> as<00:03:49.540> you

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:49.660 
to zoom in a little tighter and as you

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:51.210 
to zoom in a little tighter and as you
can<00:03:49.810> see<00:03:49.960> we<00:03:50.080> do<00:03:50.230> have<00:03:50.260> some<00:03:50.560> of<00:03:50.650> these<00:03:50.710> white

00:03:51.210 --> 00:03:51.220 
can see we do have some of these white

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:54.230 
can see we do have some of these white
little<00:03:51.520> lines<00:03:51.760> I'm<00:03:52.480> going<00:03:52.810> to<00:03:52.990> bring<00:03:53.710> the

00:03:54.230 --> 00:03:54.240 
little lines I'm going to bring the

00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:57.360 
little lines I'm going to bring the
mid-tone<00:03:55.240> slider<00:03:55.270> to<00:03:56.020> the<00:03:56.050> left<00:03:56.190> just<00:03:57.190> to

00:03:57.360 --> 00:03:57.370 
mid-tone slider to the left just to

00:03:57.370 --> 00:03:59.970 
mid-tone slider to the left just to
lighten<00:03:57.730> some<00:03:57.910> of<00:03:58.030> those<00:03:58.120> light<00:03:58.600> lines<00:03:58.930> and<00:03:59.320> I

00:03:59.970 --> 00:03:59.980 
lighten some of those light lines and I

00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:01.850 
lighten some of those light lines and I
think<00:04:00.160> that<00:04:00.280> looks<00:04:00.430> good<00:04:00.580> right<00:04:00.790> about<00:04:00.970> there

00:04:01.850 --> 00:04:01.860 
think that looks good right about there

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:04.410 
think that looks good right about there
now<00:04:02.860> I'm<00:04:02.980> going<00:04:03.220> to<00:04:03.310> hide<00:04:03.610> it<00:04:03.820> our<00:04:03.940> light<00:04:04.240> and

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:04.420 
now I'm going to hide it our light and

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:07.140

00:04:21.960 --> 00:04:21.970 
of those small little lines here but by

00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:23.430 
of those small little lines here but by

before and after as you can see we've

00:05:08.199 --> 00:05:09.990 
before and after as you can see we've
really<00:05:08.560> smooth<00:05:08.889> out<00:05:09.039> the<00:05:09.189> skin<00:05:09.310> but<00:05:09.639> we<00:05:09.729> still

00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:10.000 
really smooth out the skin but we still

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:12.899 
really smooth out the skin but we still
retain<00:05:10.150> some<00:05:10.659> of<00:05:10.689> the<00:05:10.840> texture<00:05:11.520> again<00:05:12.520> before

retain some of the texture again before

00:05:12.909 --> 00:05:17.100 
retain some of the texture again before
and<00:05:13.770> after<00:05:14.770> I<00:05:15.240> think<00:05:16.240> that<00:05:16.330> looks<00:05:16.479> nice<00:05:16.689> so<00:05:16.900> the
