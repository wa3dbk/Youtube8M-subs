00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:58.180
 countries 

00:00:55.870 --> 00:01:01.360
 here goes to the bar and they are not the same 

00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:03.129
 we also create this group if this group 

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:05.650
 which is called the club that should not be 

00:01:03.129 --> 00:01:07.920
 named I do not know if they remember something in 

00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:07.920
 that 

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:13.380
 Let's do it once every two months 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:15.479
 this same where we are going to choose a book 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:16.950
 we are going to do it to you and in the end 

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:19.050
 of these two months we are going to do this 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:21.630
 same this leaving on youtube and comment 

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:26.270
 I'm going to talk about him and his family if 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:29.100
 in the case and this this month that is going to be 

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:32.340
 until we're April 13 now it's going 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:34.020
 to be until June 1 because I am 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:35.520
 want some of you and me too 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:37.830
 personally that I buy the books 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:42.360
 by bolt opponent and bought the books 

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:44.610
 for some question that is outside of 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:47.520
 my country chile and die in bringing it and 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:48.750
 shipping etcetera then this one now 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:50.580
 more than in at least book depository 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:53.009
 that's where I want the book to be 

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:56.610
 it takes like a month to get me in 

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:58.950
 get there then I need the extra time 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:00.630
 besides the time apart to be able 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:02.310
 read the book then that's why we decided 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:04.259
 do it in two months if I find and that 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:06.450
 It's great because also in the last year 

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:08.160
 I'm like a thing collapses and I'm not going to 

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:11.580
 have that much pressure that difference 

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:15.570
 would have been every month then yes yes 

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:17.340
 and I'm talking about scorpions or 

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:19.410
 scorpion and portman races 

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:21.120
 christina so she is the same author of 

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:24.030
 the trembling trilogy that has not been 

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:26.310
 read but is also the author of the 

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:29.010
 series of the prophecy of the body of a 

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:32.100
 because it was becoming a 

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:35.040
 favorite misery because the blog of the 

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:37.980
 all characters from that book is great 

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:39.840
 I love I love that book both 

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:41.310
 are not residing but I have a 

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:43.950
 first in case you want to see list of 

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:45.630
 motel if they do not have a job but if 

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:47.670
 in the career of the carpio she says that 

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:49.080
 this is a favorite book and I want 

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:51.990
 know why this favorite book because 

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:54.000
 from reis I love it so to say it is 

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:55.860
 better than that I do not know in truth that I'm 

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.600
 excited and also in gourmets has 

00:02:55.860 --> 00:03:00.090
 his brothers ratings so I 

00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:02.010
 I want to read this video, we are going to 

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:04.350
 do on twitter if they have any 

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:05.700
 question or something to comment about 

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:07.500
 book they have to use the hashtag is 

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:09.650
 any airs like they do not come for sale 

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:11.750
 no part and for the note 

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:13.459
 where they do not ask their questions or we 

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:15.680
 they say they want to tell us about 

00:03:13.459 --> 00:03:17.599
 this book and so on is going to take 

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:19.310
 as I told them on June 1 and that 

00:03:17.599 --> 00:03:22.370
 one day Sunday and if they are in style 

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:24.319
 it's going to be in the afternoon like in 378 still 

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:26.269
 we are not one hundred percent alone and 

00:03:24.319 --> 00:03:29.450
 I'll probably make a video later 

00:03:26.269 --> 00:03:33.560
 with updates telling them or doing some 

00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:35.569
 change and explaining them more explaining them 

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:37.579
 better and also reminding them of this 

00:03:35.569 --> 00:03:39.230
 what are we doing and will it be in the 

00:03:37.579 --> 00:03:41.450
 nail channel as I told them to leave 

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:43.970
 all his works because they are Octobers 

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:46.430
 great and I feel in everything to be 

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:48.799
 part of this her everything to participate goes 

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:51.290
 to be super cool and with a book that 

00:03:48.799 --> 00:03:52.879
 is in English and also in Spanish 

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:55.220
 because we read books in English 

00:03:52.879 --> 00:03:56.420
 and it was more or less difficult to find a 

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:57.680
 book that is in English and at the same 

00:03:56.420 --> 00:03:59.540
 time in Spanish that none of 

00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:01.040
 we have left so it is the same if 

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:04.400
 you have as some recommendation 

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:07.340
 of not knowing for the next ones the 

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:10.830
 next things that we do videos 

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:13.780
 hangouts as closure and I think those 

00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:15.790
 anything I tell them and they will know or if 

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:18.400
 would like to with an additional question 

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:20.530
 I do not know I forgot to mention 

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:22.570
 that you are nothing else to see 

00:04:20.530 --> 00:04:25.210
 can you also write to me 

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:26.500
 twitter or guilty for I do not know my 

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:28.620
 social networks that work that I think that 

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:32.880
 are those 

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:34.550
 yes that would be all where today the video and 

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:36.830
 yes 

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:38.270
 I want to read it and I want you to know 

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:41.270
 unan is the perfect excuse to 

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:44.570
 buy the book buy read it zeal 

00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:46.100
 and participate and see you in the next 

00:04:44.570 --> 00:04:49.090
 video that I'm going to record like five 

00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:49.090
 minutes years
