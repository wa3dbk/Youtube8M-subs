 recycling granutech team owns a synergistic business model 

00:00:06.890 --> 00:00:10.730
 developed to meet the recovery objectives of each 

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:12.369
 communities 

00:00:12.369 --> 00:00:16.119
 more than 13 million metric tons of residual materials are 

00:00:16.119 --> 00:00:17.890
 currently generated in Quebec 

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:20.890
 and alone by four different sectors 

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:24.800
 more than 6 million 500 thousand metric tons of residual materials 

00:00:25.339 --> 00:00:26.480
 are still sent 

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:28.529
 to elimination 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:31.529
 the selective collection of recyclable materials sector 

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:36.000
 recovers annually just over 500 thousand metric tons of material 

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:42.080
 existing sorting centers alchemy the recyclable materials to the 

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:45.130
 companies that recycle its products 

00:00:45.130 --> 00:00:49.790
 recycling granutech he is interested in recyclable materials rejected by the 

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:50.890
 coupled price

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:56.410
 commercial and institutional industrial sector 

00:00:56.410 --> 00:01:00.120
 for acronym he passed he says generates a large amount of waste 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:03.309
 this sector has almost no solution 

00:01:03.309 --> 00:01:05.640
 to increase recovery 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:09.380
 the residual materials in this area are largely when we saw 

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:11.860
 only to landfills 

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:15.509
 the construction or renovation demolition sector 

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:18.380
 having for the commune it is clear of 

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:21.460
 greatly interested companies 

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:25.060
 the material potential swallower peenaert jt they were related 

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:29.590
 recycling granutech is also not interested in the sector of 

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:31.630
 ecocentres 

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:36.479
 several tic energy swallower residual materials are found in these 

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:38.350
 centers 

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:42.900
 dry granutech recycling is a solution for communities in order to 

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:48.030
 help them achieve their recovery goals by diverting the maximum 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:51.030
 of residual materials from landfill 

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:55.810
 the planting of new sorting and packing centers allows the 

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:57.740
 job creation in the regions 

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:01.080
 and allows the reduction of greenhouse gases he put 

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:04.080
 during transportation and landfill activities 

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:10.000
 the new sorting and packaging center enables the processing of 

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.319
 residual materials from the hcr de 

00:02:13.889 --> 00:02:14.920
 construction 

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:17.589
 renovation and demolition 

00:02:17.589 --> 00:02:19.349
 and ecocentres 

00:02:19.349 --> 00:02:21.699
 of the jc ilike sector 

00:02:21.699 --> 00:02:25.409
 institutional and commercial and to distribute to it 

00:02:25.409 --> 00:02:29.930
 a small amount of residual materials rejected 17 hours from the 

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:31.299
 selective collection 

00:02:31.299 --> 00:02:33.279
 as well as private entrants 

00:02:33.279 --> 00:02:36.279
 possessing a high value it emerges 

00:02:37.239 --> 00:02:40.819
 the first phase of the waste reception process 

00:02:41.639 --> 00:02:44.499
 is to make a price of materials 

00:02:44.499 --> 00:02:46.599
 once sorting is done 

00:02:46.599 --> 00:02:50.709
 certain subjects will find their respective paths towards the different 

00:02:50.709 --> 00:02:51.370
 channels 

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:54.209
 recovery 

00:02:54.209 --> 00:02:58.430
 collection of domestic waste but not a sector targeted by recycling 

00:02:58.430 --> 00:02:59.559
 Granutech 

00:02:59.559 --> 00:03:04.039
 however, there is some potential for materials to be found there 

00:03:04.039 --> 00:03:08.989
 for composting a wise pressing phase will have to be done in order to 

00:03:08.989 --> 00:03:11.049
 to lower the humidity level 

00:03:11.049 --> 00:03:14.709
 the contrast will then be sent to the packaging center 

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:17.499
 and energy production 

00:03:17.499 --> 00:03:20.810
 once the parisi dual materials are sent to their subsidiary 

00:03:20.809 --> 00:03:22.279
 respective 

00:03:22.279 --> 00:03:26.839
 the remaining materials in the conditioning center its potential for the 

00:03:26.839 --> 00:03:30.059

00:03:33.979 --> 00:03:36.200
 has the solution 

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:39.409
 in order to give them a value not throw 

00:03:39.409 --> 00:03:43.129

00:03:43.129 --> 00:03:45.349
 recycling h 

00:03:45.349 --> 00:03:51.209
 our vision is to recycle 100% of the total weight of residual matter 

00:03:51.209 --> 00:03:54.209
 entering our packing centers 

00:03:54.739 --> 00:03:56.939
 once the conditioning is done 

00:03:56.939 --> 00:04:00.400
 there will be three categories of materials at the exit of the process 

00:04:01.429 --> 00:04:06.469
 the metals will be removed for recycling and sent to its subsidiary 

00:04:06.469 --> 00:04:08.719
 respectively

00:04:21.139 --> 00:04:23.270
 energy value materials 

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:26.300
 will be mixed with very high energy value materials 

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:28.180
 conditioned 

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:31.930

00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:34.930
 revenue the value of atypical assets 

00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:40.919
 the energy recovery of matter residues it they allow 

00:04:40.919 --> 00:04:46.039
 a substitution for fossil fuels and promotes an economy of 

00:04:46.039 --> 00:04:49.160
 costs for the benefit of our energy producers 

00:04:50.909 --> 00:04:54.989
 the use of energy-based recipes gives them a 

00:04:54.989 --> 00:04:59.009
 very important production cost reduction to stay 

00:04:59.009 --> 00:04:59.939
 competitive 

00:04:59.939 --> 00:05:02.939
 and preserve the jobs already in place 

00:05:03.999 --> 00:05:08.679
 komsic there I was afraid tech is a producer of recipes worth inergy

00:05:31.059 --> 00:05:35.810
 the company offers a technology of fluidized boilers 

00:05:35.810 --> 00:05:39.889
 to valorize the residual materials having no other 

00:05:39.889 --> 00:05:42.159
 value-added solution 

00:05:42.159 --> 00:05:45.850
 this technology makes it possible to consume residual matter 

00:05:45.850 --> 00:05:49.010
 for the purpose of producing electric thermal energy 

00:05:49.610 --> 00:05:54.219
 the vision of qualitative recycling will be to develop processes 

00:05:54.219 --> 00:05:56.330
 alternative processing 

00:05:56.330 --> 00:05:58.669
