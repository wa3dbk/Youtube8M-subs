00:00:01.210 --> 00:00:03.810
 the mania 

00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:15.340
 the current one is here we have gross commenting 

00:00:12.550 --> 00:00:17.380
 a video library both and good background 

00:00:15.340 --> 00:00:20.439
 I'm having a game in slums with the 

00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:22.810
 mp 7 with quick muffler and charger 

00:00:20.439 --> 00:00:24.400
 look laser a bestiality more than 40 

00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:26.349
 low I had it for the save and decided 

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:28.900
 put it because I'm going to bring you all the 

00:00:26.349 --> 00:00:30.369
 black ops 3 information I do not know if what 

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:33.070
 I will do in a single video or in two 

00:00:30.369 --> 00:00:34.450
 but surely I'll do it in two because 

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:36.579
 As time goes by it's coming out 

00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:38.290
 more information so no more 

00:00:36.579 --> 00:00:39.790
 procrastination let's start with all the 

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:42.780
 information I have about the black ops 

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:45.730
 3 first tell you that you will leave not with 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:47.590
 2.065 if I remember correctly it can be a 

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:49.270
 last and surely it can be done 

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:51.070
 spawn trap makes me focus it 

00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:53.380
 very much on the channel and I think that you 

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:55.540
 is going to molar very much and good now we are going 

00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:57.780
 to go with a little one that will molar 

00:00:55.540 --> 00:01:00.480
 also what are the rats 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:02.760
 there are a lot of new streaks I believe and 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:05.159
 they can be pretty spectacular just 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:07.049
 tell you that it can reassure you because 

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:09.540
 they look a lot like blackout 2 

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:10.799
 like many things that I am going to tell you 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:13.409
 what is the wow 

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:15.570
 the hp x that is the stroller that all 

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:17.790
 we know but more modern then we have 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:19.500
 the new response fish the sentinel 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:21.030
 the help package now comes a 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:23.790
 streak with a different name that is 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:26.940
 cluster missile that is the typical hairston 

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:28.770
 then we went through the attack to the gm that 

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:30.990
 launches three missiles that I would compare 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:32.490
 with the lightning attack then the machine 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:34.289
 of death that we all know the 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:36.270
 destruction aitor I do not know what it is now 

00:01:34.289 --> 00:01:38.700
 same but it looks like a streak 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:41.159
 powerful then we went through the break that 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:43.830
 would be an escort drone then we have 

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:46.380
 the cl unit that would be a robot that 

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:49.170
 protects that I then mine with a 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:51.479
 agr from the with 2 then we have the 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:53.970
 wanted to kiss just tell you that it will not be 

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:56.159
 so as extremely state as I was in 

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:58.470
 the black or 2 but good at least what 

00:01:56.159 --> 00:01:59.970
 we have no we would not continue with the penalty 

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:02.310
 and now we would enter with the most 

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:04.110
 stable of the game that would be rams that 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:06.450
 It would be me I think it relates 

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:08.670
 with a swarm because of an aircraft 

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:10.800
 Take out skewer balls and look for the 

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:12.660
 enemies so I would relate it a 

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:15.780
 poquillo and then also the flies 

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:18.630
 ardent that it would be a mini swarm that 

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:20.790
 we request and burn the enemies those 

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:22.980
 two would relate a little bit to the 

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:25.440
 swarm and then we went through with the tank 

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:27.990
 spider that would be a terrestrial thing 

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:29.970
 we could say and finally the streak 

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:32.910
 more tempted than it would be on the mothership 

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:35.190
 that we would control it three people if 

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:37.020
 we would like to suppose and well yes yes 

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:39.570
 let's move on with another little one that would be 

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:40.950
 the beta is going to come out in september is that 

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:42.270
 a height is entering me nothing more than 

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:43.530
 read the outline that I have done in 

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:46.110
 September in the beginning of September 

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:48.290
 the beta will come out that would be like more or 

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:51.570
 less the game would end and finally 

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:54.480
 would leave in November is already at stake to 

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:56.520
 sell the beta I think you can try 

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:58.970
 if the reservations and such I have is that I have 

00:02:56.520 --> 00:03:01.530
 a scoundrel then black ops 3 

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:03.750
 surely almost a time for a hundred just 

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:05.459
 leave for the annexation you have to have 

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:07.380
 hopes to be taken out for the o 

00:03:05.459 --> 00:03:09.720
 ok but good I would say that it's just going to 

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:10.630
 leave for nobody then you would not look for 

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:12.520
 as anwar 

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:15.280
 could not be done once they like it 

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:17.200
 that's good that's a point in favor it 

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:19.420
 would look like cough blank and now 

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:21.430
 let's go through for a very topic 

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:23.830
 important that it's something different and that 

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:25.840
 can fly a lot more about soldiers 

00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:29.770
 and you will say that you are telling me marzipan 

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:32.620
 the soldiers is one thing that you believe 

00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:34.930
 your class and then you take a soldier and 

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:37.150
 each soldier will have one skill and one 

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:39.430
 gun tell you that this will be very 

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:42.430
 balanced and can only be used once 

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:44.710
 in the whole game with the l1 plus the r1 

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:47.350
 only once and it will be very balanced not 

00:03:44.710 --> 00:03:49.510
 will be invited not too lazy and good 

00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:51.310
 the soldier see there are nine types but I 

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:54.490
 I can only say 5 

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:56.890
 well no 4 what would be the ruin that causes 

00:03:54.490 --> 00:03:59.050
 a sling against the ground from 

00:03:56.890 --> 00:04:00.970
 some clubs and has more speed that 

00:03:59.050 --> 00:04:03.130
 then we would be their ability to 

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:05.470
 it will be that it is a girl and her special weapon 

00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:08.140
 is a gun called animator that 

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:09.700
 kills a single shot even if it's a cross 

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:11.830
 more than that it's spectacular 

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:13.660
 at the tip of the map and has a 

00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:16.090
 multiplier what does that mean if 

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:16.840
 take a flag and take worth 200 points 

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:19.239
 well 

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:21.040
 at 400 points that will be achieved before 

00:04:19.239 --> 00:04:23.680
 the gusts that can be something very very 

00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:25.060
 well then we went through the try 

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:26.620
 she is also a girl that her weapon 

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:29.979
 special as you will have seen in the 

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:33.130
 trailer is a bow and its ability is that 

00:04:29.979 --> 00:04:34.720
 on the minimap you will have to see the 

00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:37.449
 enemies when you get a little closer 

00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:39.280
 then we went through the reaper which is a 

00:04:37.449 --> 00:04:40.900
 robot that your special weapon will be a mega 

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:43.870
 weapon turret that you will also have 

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:46.210
 seen in the trailer and its ability is to 

00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:48.070
 teleports tell you that she though 

00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:50.200
 as I have said anything not enough che 

00:04:48.070 --> 00:04:52.660
 is 2 was all balanced or I hope so 

00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:54.580
 and finally let's move on with the 

00:04:52.660 --> 00:04:56.820
 movements that the first movement that 

00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:59.680
 we have seen is the world run and that is 

00:04:56.820 --> 00:05:01.000
 run around the walls but during a 

00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:02.590
 second you are not going to have a game 

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:05.860
 running there by the walls then 

00:05:02.590 --> 00:05:07.540
 we go with the jump with momentum it will not be 

00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:09.250
 like nothing warfare there will be double jump 

00:05:07.540 --> 00:05:11.560
 thank goodness they have removed it will be a jump 

00:05:09.250 --> 00:05:12.690
 bigger to climb higher cycles 

00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:16.449
 without having to climb the stairs 

00:05:12.690 --> 00:05:18.880
 then we could dive and shoot the 

00:05:16.449 --> 00:05:21.010
 time and you can also slide while 

00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:22.990
 while you shoot that's a good thing 

00:05:21.010 --> 00:05:23.440
 and one kids the last thing I want 

00:05:22.990 --> 00:05:25.750
 tell 

00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:28.510
 that is going to see cinema mode returns mode 

00:05:25.750 --> 00:05:30.700
 cinema almost 100% that's very good that's 

00:05:28.510 --> 00:05:33.670
 what you say, my mother, you have to buy 

00:05:30.700 --> 00:05:35.770
 you have to buy movie 4 and give it 

00:05:33.670 --> 00:05:37.120
 cane to black ops 3 and drinkable here 

00:05:35.770 --> 00:05:39.250
 I'm saying goodbye I hope that I have 

00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:41.590
 liked this comment tell you that 

00:05:39.250 --> 00:05:43.540
 I have many more information but 

00:05:41.590 --> 00:05:45.400
 that I'll take it out in a video soon 

00:05:43.540 --> 00:05:47.350
 when I have more and good, I hope that 

00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:48.820
 I have made a greater comment and nothing 

00:05:47.350 --> 00:05:50.230
 guys I hope you leave a piece in 

00:05:48.820 --> 00:05:52.510
 like you share this video with 

00:05:50.230 --> 00:05:54.340
 your colleagues and nothing fighters here 

00:05:52.510 --> 00:05:58.260
 I bid farewell light favorites and see you 

00:05:54.340 --> 00:05:58.260
 in the next act with wrestlers 

00:06:02.210 --> 00:06:06.940
 Web 

00:06:04.070 --> 00:06:06.940
 well
