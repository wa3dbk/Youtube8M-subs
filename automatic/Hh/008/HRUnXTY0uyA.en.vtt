 Hello friends with you garbage 74 

00:00:03.419 --> 00:00:12.990
 Today I have a tanchik in my review 

00:00:07.790 --> 00:00:15.059
 T-80 tank hefty bitch so I do not 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:17.430
 I know who made it and without knowing the author 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:18.859
 knowing nothing about this tank just me 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:23.310
 now 

00:00:18.859 --> 00:00:26.400
 man one gave here so to speak 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:29.269
 review that is, he already did a review on 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:33.829
 he is now shared with me 

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:35.900
 thank him so much for this let's 

00:00:33.829 --> 00:00:39.650
 a little bit and 

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:41.720
 I will add a sound like this 

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:43.450
 can be said for this model that is 

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:45.310
 this is a tank 

00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:48.870
 rollers 

00:00:45.310 --> 00:00:50.320
 that is, the tracks are spinning accordingly 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:52.540
 no animation 

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:55.300
 the only problem now is 

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:58.090

00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:59.829

00:00:58.090 --> 00:01:01.390
 did as you can see on their 

00:00:59.829 --> 00:01:03.399
 screens 

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:04.290
 puzzles all spin on animation to 

00:01:03.399 --> 00:01:06.510

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:11.220
 yet absent 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:14.050
 But in principle, the model is of course gorgeous 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:19.180

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:21.780

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:21.780

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:34.510
