vital signs such as temperature and ECGs
and<00:01:10.380> on<00:01:11.070> the<00:01:11.190> patient<00:01:11.550> monitor<00:01:11.880> we<00:01:12.000> can<00:01:12.030> see

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
and on the patient monitor we can see

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:14.690 
and on the patient monitor we can see
the<00:01:12.810> values<00:01:13.229> that<00:01:13.350> we<00:01:13.470> simulate<00:01:13.920> and<00:01:14.550> these

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
the values that we simulate and these

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:15.800 
the values that we simulate and these
are<00:01:14.850> all<00:01:14.940> the<00:01:15.060> values<00:01:15.420> that<00:01:15.509> you<00:01:15.660> would

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
are all the values that you would

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:17.420 
are all the values that you would
normally<00:01:16.200> take<00:01:16.380> from<00:01:16.590> a<00:01:16.680> patient<00:01:17.100> in<00:01:17.250> critical

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:17.430 
normally take from a patient in critical

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:19.730 
normally take from a patient in critical
care<00:01:17.910> we<00:01:18.690> can<00:01:18.840> now<00:01:18.960> simulate<00:01:19.259> them<00:01:19.560> with<00:01:19.710> a

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
care we can now simulate them with a

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:21.800 
care we can now simulate them with a
single<00:01:20.070> device<00:01:20.369> and<00:01:20.670> it<00:01:21.030> will<00:01:21.149> guarantee<00:01:21.330> or

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
single device and it will guarantee or

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:24.260 
single device and it will guarantee or
check<00:01:22.050> the<00:01:22.170> performance<00:01:22.680> of<00:01:22.830> the<00:01:23.340> medical

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
check the performance of the medical

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:26.540 
check the performance of the medical
device<00:01:24.590> so<00:01:25.590> it<00:01:25.740> sounds<00:01:26.009> like<00:01:26.070> this<00:01:26.340> will<00:01:26.520> make

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:26.550 
device so it sounds like this will make

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:28.639 
device so it sounds like this will make
life<00:01:26.940> for<00:01:27.360> medical<00:01:27.630> care<00:01:27.750> stuff<00:01:28.020> much<00:01:28.259> easier

00:01:28.639 --> 00:01:28.649 
life for medical care stuff much easier

00:01:28.649 --> 00:01:30.820 
life for medical care stuff much easier
yes<00:01:29.310> considering<00:01:29.790> they<00:01:30.030> have<00:01:30.060> to<00:01:30.270> carry<00:01:30.539> a

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:30.830 
yes considering they have to carry a

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:33.169 
yes considering they have to carry a
seven<00:01:31.830> eight<00:01:32.009> nine<00:01:32.190> different<00:01:32.670> bits<00:01:32.819> of<00:01:32.940> test

00:01:33.169 --> 00:01:33.179 
seven eight nine different bits of test

00:01:33.179 --> 00:01:35.840 
seven eight nine different bits of test
kit<00:01:33.420> when<00:01:33.929> they<00:01:34.020> go<00:01:34.140> on<00:01:34.259> site<00:01:34.729> reducing<00:01:35.729> the

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 
kit when they go on site reducing the

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:37.249 
kit when they go on site reducing the
number<00:01:36.090> of<00:01:36.179> test<00:01:36.420> kit<00:01:36.600> they<00:01:36.720> can<00:01:36.869> carry<00:01:37.110> around

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
number of test kit they can carry around

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:39.320 
number of test kit they can carry around
will<00:01:37.860> make<00:01:38.009> them<00:01:38.190> more<00:01:38.310> effective<00:01:38.580> and<00:01:39.030> it

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:39.330 
will make them more effective and it

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:40.969 
will make them more effective and it
makes<00:01:39.509> their<00:01:39.660> life<00:01:39.780> a<00:01:39.990> lot<00:01:40.110> easier<00:01:40.530> here<00:01:40.770> so<00:01:40.950> I

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:40.979 
makes their life a lot easier here so I

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:57.800 
makes their life a lot easier here so I
agree<00:01:41.280> with<00:01:41.310> you

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:01:59.869 

you
