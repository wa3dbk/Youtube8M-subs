00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:23.350 
have this problem with this particular

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:25.530 
have this problem with this particular
formula<00:03:23.709> it<00:03:24.280> really<00:03:24.579> holds<00:03:24.790> true<00:03:25.120> the<00:03:25.360> shape

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:25.540 
formula it really holds true the shape

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:27.600 
formula it really holds true the shape
of<00:03:25.690> my<00:03:25.720> lips<00:03:26.019> without<00:03:26.230> any<00:03:26.650> sort<00:03:26.829> of<00:03:26.920> liner<00:03:27.190> or

00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:31.750 
powder or whatever and so for me that's

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:33.750 
powder or whatever and so for me that's
a<00:03:31.930> huge<00:03:32.140> plus<00:03:32.320> the<00:03:32.620> glossiness<00:03:33.040> which<00:03:33.459> is<00:03:33.610> very

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:33.760 
a huge plus the glossiness which is very

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:34.860 
a huge plus the glossiness which is very
flattering<00:03:34.090> the<00:03:34.390> fact<00:03:34.570> that<00:03:34.600> it's<00:03:34.780> quite

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:34.870 
flattering the fact that it's quite

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:37.440 
flattering the fact that it's quite
opaque<00:03:35.410> and<00:03:35.799> has<00:03:36.100> amazing<00:03:36.670> coverage<00:03:37.030> and<00:03:37.329> then

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:37.450 
opaque and has amazing coverage and then

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:39.449 
opaque and has amazing coverage and then
I<00:03:37.480> think<00:03:37.870> the<00:03:37.930> shades<00:03:38.230> are<00:03:38.500> just<00:03:38.739> so<00:03:38.920> soft<00:03:39.250> and

00:03:39.449 --> 00:03:39.459 
I think the shades are just so soft and

00:03:39.459 --> 00:03:43.970 
I think the shades are just so soft and
pretty<00:03:39.579> so<00:03:40.540> pink<00:03:41.290> chocolate<00:03:41.560> to<00:03:41.860> me<00:03:42.040> is<00:03:42.840> an

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:43.980 
pretty so pink chocolate to me is an

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:46.740 
pretty so pink chocolate to me is an
a-plus-plus<00:03:45.209> either<00:03:46.209> like<00:03:46.390> it<00:03:46.540> or<00:03:46.570> you<00:03:46.660> don't

00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:46.750 
a-plus-plus either like it or you don't

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:50.479 
a-plus-plus either like it or you don't
but<00:03:47.049> I<00:03:47.079> think<00:03:47.350> for<00:03:47.620> my<00:03:47.829> skin<00:03:48.160> tone<00:03:48.370> and<00:03:48.760> and

00:03:50.479 --> 00:03:50.489 
but I think for my skin tone and and

00:03:50.489 --> 00:03:53.310 
but I think for my skin tone and and
looks<00:03:51.489> it's<00:03:51.760> just<00:03:52.090> an<00:03:52.299> amazing<00:03:52.600> shade<00:03:52.989> I'm<00:03:53.109> so

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:53.320 
looks it's just an amazing shade I'm so

00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:55.590 
looks it's just an amazing shade I'm so
so<00:03:53.799> so<00:03:54.010> glad<00:03:54.190> I<00:03:54.250> got<00:03:54.459> it<00:03:54.519> I'm<00:03:55.239> going<00:03:55.390> to<00:03:55.450> turn

00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:55.600 
so so glad I got it I'm going to turn

buff okay now i have in the buff so i

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:05.460 
buff okay now i have in the buff so i
could<00:04:04.359> tend<00:04:04.540> to<00:04:04.630> be<00:04:04.720> pretty<00:04:04.900> harsh<00:04:05.230> on<00:04:05.410> my

00:04:05.460 --> 00:04:05.470 
could tend to be pretty harsh on my

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:07.319 
could tend to be pretty harsh on my
definitions<00:04:06.010> on<00:04:06.190> wearability<00:04:06.670> of<00:04:06.880> lipsticks

00:04:07.319 --> 00:04:07.329 
definitions on wearability of lipsticks

00:04:07.329 --> 00:04:10.080 
definitions on wearability of lipsticks
with<00:04:07.570> a<00:04:08.320> color<00:04:08.829> that's<00:04:08.890> darker<00:04:09.430> like<00:04:09.820> the<00:04:09.970> one

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:10.090 
with a color that's darker like the one

00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:11.940 
with a color that's darker like the one
I<00:04:10.120> had<00:04:10.269> on<00:04:10.390> 1st<00:04:10.570> pink<00:04:10.930> chocolate<00:04:11.140> there<00:04:11.769> is

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:11.950 
I had on 1st pink chocolate there is

00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:13.440 
I had on 1st pink chocolate there is
some<00:04:12.250> staining<00:04:12.519> just<00:04:12.850> a<00:04:12.940> little<00:04:13.150> bit<00:04:13.269> so<00:04:13.420> I

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:13.450 
some staining just a little bit so I

00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:15.090 
some staining just a little bit so I
think<00:04:13.600> it<00:04:13.810> tends<00:04:14.049> to<00:04:14.200> look<00:04:14.470> like<00:04:14.650> it's<00:04:14.829> wearing

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:15.100 
think it tends to look like it's wearing

00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:17.279 
think it tends to look like it's wearing
better<00:04:15.640> then<00:04:16.359> maybe<00:04:16.570> it<00:04:16.720> is<00:04:16.840> because<00:04:16.989> you<00:04:17.169> got

00:04:17.279 --> 00:04:17.289 
better then maybe it is because you got

00:04:17.289 --> 00:04:18.569 
better then maybe it is because you got
that<00:04:17.380> stain<00:04:17.650> on<00:04:17.799> your<00:04:17.829> lips<00:04:18.100> you<00:04:18.250> look<00:04:18.430> like

00:04:18.569 --> 00:04:18.579 
that stain on your lips you look like

00:04:18.579 --> 00:04:19.800 
that stain on your lips you look like
you<00:04:18.669> have<00:04:18.760> more<00:04:18.850> lipstick<00:04:19.180> on<00:04:19.329> than<00:04:19.479> you<00:04:19.600> do

00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:19.810 
you have more lipstick on than you do

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:21.599 
you have more lipstick on than you do
with<00:04:20.590> a<00:04:20.620> color<00:04:20.859> like<00:04:21.010> this<00:04:21.070> there<00:04:21.459> is<00:04:21.579> no

00:04:21.599 --> 00:04:21.609 
with a color like this there is no

00:04:21.609 --> 00:04:23.909 
with a color like this there is no
staining<00:04:22.030> so<00:04:22.450> this<00:04:22.900> right<00:04:23.080> here<00:04:23.140> is<00:04:23.380> described

00:04:23.909 --> 00:04:23.919

00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:39.060 
inside or on me but I think this color
