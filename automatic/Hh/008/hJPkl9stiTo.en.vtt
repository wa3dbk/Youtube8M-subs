little<00:04:49.570> game<00:04:49.720> has<00:04:49.930> been<00:04:50.050> out<00:04:50.230> for<00:04:50.440> three<00:04:50.470> weeks

00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:50.910 
little game has been out for three weeks

00:04:50.910 --> 00:04:55.290 
little game has been out for three weeks
and<00:04:51.910> it's<00:04:52.570> just<00:04:52.780> a<00:04:52.870> great<00:04:53.260> example<00:04:53.620> of<00:04:53.980> how<00:04:54.300> we

00:04:55.290 --> 00:04:55.300 
and it's just a great example of how we

00:04:55.300 --> 00:04:58.440 
and it's just a great example of how we
are<00:04:55.540> effectively<00:04:55.810> extending<00:04:56.740> the<00:04:57.450> platforms

00:04:58.440 --> 00:04:58.450 
are effectively extending the platforms

00:04:58.450 --> 00:05:00.860 
are effectively extending the platforms
that<00:04:58.540> game<00:04:58.960> developers<00:04:59.560> can<00:04:59.830> reach<00:05:00.280> gamers

00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:00.870 
that game developers can reach gamers

00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:02.970 
that game developers can reach gamers
which<00:05:01.870> obviously<00:05:02.020> has<00:05:02.290> done<00:05:02.590> through

00:05:02.970 --> 00:05:02.980 
which obviously has done through

00:05:02.980 --> 00:05:05.010 
which obviously has done through
iterations<00:05:03.550> from<00:05:04.030> packaged<00:05:04.420> goods<00:05:04.660> to

00:05:05.010 --> 00:05:05.020 
iterations from packaged goods to

00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:07.770 
iterations from packaged goods to
browser-based<00:05:05.700> to<00:05:06.700> the<00:05:07.000> social<00:05:07.360> network

00:05:07.770 --> 00:05:07.780 
browser-based to the social network

00:05:07.780 --> 00:05:09.210 
browser-based to the social network
based<00:05:08.050> and<00:05:08.410> now<00:05:08.530> we're<00:05:08.710> doing<00:05:08.950> it<00:05:09.040> effectively

00:05:09.210 --> 00:05:09.220 
based and now we're doing it effectively

00:05:09.220 --> 00:05:12.600 
based and now we're doing it effectively
in<00:05:09.550> the<00:05:09.670> chrome<00:05:09.910> of<00:05:10.090> the<00:05:10.180> browser<00:05:10.420> and<00:05:11.610> we're

00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:12.610 
in the chrome of the browser and we're

00:05:12.610 --> 00:05:15.930 
in the chrome of the browser and we're
quite<00:05:12.880> excited<00:05:13.830> it<00:05:14.830> works<00:05:15.130> on<00:05:15.340> Firefox

00:05:15.930 --> 00:05:15.940 
quite excited it works on Firefox

00:05:15.940 --> 00:05:20.100 
quite excited it works on Firefox
Internet<00:05:16.510> Explorer<00:05:17.110> and<00:05:17.500> Safari<00:05:18.990> it's<00:05:19.990> in

00:05:20.100 --> 00:05:20.110 
Internet Explorer and Safari it's in

00:05:20.110 --> 00:05:25.500 
Internet Explorer and Safari it's in
development<00:05:20.640> the<00:05:21.640> the<00:05:22.000> and<00:05:22.630> we<00:05:23.560> will<00:05:24.510> be

00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:25.510 
development the the and we will be

00:05:25.510 --> 00:05:27.590 
development the the and we will be
announcing<00:05:25.720> that<00:05:26.020> before<00:05:26.530> too<00:05:26.650> long<00:05:26.920> and

00:05:27.590 --> 00:05:27.600 
announcing that before too long and

00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:29.940 
announcing that before too long and
we're<00:05:28.600> then<00:05:28.750> looking<00:05:29.050> to<00:05:29.230> extend<00:05:29.470> the

00:05:29.940 --> 00:05:29.950 
we're then looking to extend the

00:05:29.950 --> 00:05:32.720 
we're then looking to extend the
technology<00:05:30.670> so<00:05:30.880> that<00:05:30.910> it'll<00:05:31.180> work<00:05:31.420> across

00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:32.730 
technology so that it'll work across

00:05:32.730 --> 00:05:35.310 
technology so that it'll work across
additional<00:05:33.730> platforms<00:05:34.060> and<00:05:34.570> devices<00:05:34.600> on<00:05:35.230> the

00:05:35.310 --> 00:05:35.320 
additional platforms and devices on the

00:05:35.320 --> 00:05:37.080 
additional platforms and devices on the
mobile<00:05:35.500> and<00:05:35.950> set-top<00:05:36.130> box<00:05:36.520> base<00:05:36.760> in<00:05:36.970> the

00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:37.090 
mobile and set-top box base in the

00:05:37.090 --> 00:05:42.939 
mobile and set-top box base in the
future<00:05:38.280> yes<00:05:39.280> it<00:05:39.460> does<00:05:39.610> if<00:05:39.880> the

00:05:42.939 --> 00:05:42.949 

00:05:42.949 --> 00:05:45.559 

publisher<00:05:43.949> designs<00:05:44.429> it<00:05:44.639> in<00:05:44.759> that<00:05:44.939> way<00:05:44.969> as<00:05:45.389> it

00:05:45.559 --> 00:05:45.569 
publisher designs it in that way as it

00:05:45.569 --> 00:05:47.779 
publisher designs it in that way as it
can<00:05:45.779> yeah<00:05:46.169> it's<00:05:46.559> basically<00:05:46.889> on<00:05:47.069> in<00:05:47.489> the<00:05:47.579> cash

00:05:47.779 --> 00:05:47.789 
can yeah it's basically on in the cash

00:05:47.789 --> 00:05:50.119 
can yeah it's basically on in the cash
but<00:05:48.509> if<00:05:48.599> it's<00:05:48.749> if<00:05:48.989> it's<00:05:49.139> live<00:05:49.469> data<00:05:49.799> and<00:05:50.009> it's

00:05:50.119 --> 00:05:50.129 
but if it's if it's live data and it's

00:05:50.129 --> 00:05:51.859 
but if it's if it's live data and it's
drawing<00:05:50.279> from<00:05:50.549> a<00:05:50.669> server<00:05:50.909> then<00:05:51.209> it<00:05:51.509> won't<00:05:51.689> work

00:05:51.859 --> 00:05:51.869 
drawing from a server then it won't work

00:05:51.869 --> 00:05:54.079 
drawing from a server then it won't work
because<00:05:52.110> obviously<00:05:52.319> pulling<00:05:52.919> in<00:05:53.069> the<00:05:53.909> live

00:05:54.079 --> 00:05:54.089 
because obviously pulling in the live

00:05:54.089 --> 00:05:58.189 
because obviously pulling in the live
data<00:05:54.329> so<00:05:54.749> you<00:05:54.959> know<00:05:55.319> for<00:05:55.499> example<00:05:55.589> the<00:05:57.199> indoors

00:05:58.189 --> 00:05:58.199 
data so you know for example the indoors

00:05:58.199 --> 00:06:00.189 
data so you know for example the indoors
example<00:05:58.799> that<00:05:58.889> I<00:05:59.009> was<00:05:59.189> showing<00:05:59.339> you<00:05:59.549> before

00:06:00.189 --> 00:06:00.199 
example that I was showing you before

00:06:00.199 --> 00:06:04.069 
example that I was showing you before
this<00:06:01.199> this<00:06:01.529> coins<00:06:01.829> here<00:06:02.639> would<00:06:03.569> just<00:06:03.959> say

00:06:04.069 --> 00:06:04.079 
this this coins here would just say

00:06:04.079 --> 00:06:05.600 
this this coins here would just say
coins<00:06:04.409> it<00:06:04.679> wouldn't<00:06:04.919> say<00:06:05.099> that<00:06:05.339> you've<00:06:05.429> got

00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:05.610 
coins it wouldn't say that you've got

00:06:05.610 --> 00:06:07.249 
coins it wouldn't say that you've got
three<00:06:05.849> thousand<00:06:06.269> coins<00:06:06.449> if<00:06:06.779> you<00:06:06.929> couldn't

00:06:07.249 --> 00:06:07.259 
three thousand coins if you couldn't

00:06:07.259 --> 00:06:16.369 
three thousand coins if you couldn't
pull<00:06:07.409> it<00:06:07.439> from<00:06:07.709> the<00:06:07.769> server<00:06:13.189> thank<00:06:14.189> you
