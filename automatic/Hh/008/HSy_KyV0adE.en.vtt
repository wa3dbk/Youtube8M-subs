00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:08.990 
seen this before one key step makes sure
you<00:02:07.200> cover<00:02:07.590> it<00:02:07.860> with<00:02:07.890> just<00:02:08.310> a<00:02:08.459> little<00:02:08.610> bit<00:02:08.759> of

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:09.000 
you cover it with just a little bit of

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.080 
you cover it with just a little bit of
saran<00:02:09.390> wrap<00:02:09.690> this<00:02:10.319> is<00:02:10.500> gonna<00:02:10.679> basically<00:02:11.280> suck

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:12.090 
saran wrap this is gonna basically suck

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:14.030 
saran wrap this is gonna basically suck
in<00:02:12.360> the<00:02:12.600> whole<00:02:12.780> heating<00:02:13.230> process<00:02:13.769> to<00:02:13.890> make

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:14.040 
in the whole heating process to make

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:16.190 
in the whole heating process to make
sure<00:02:14.250> it's<00:02:14.430> contained<00:02:14.970> in<00:02:15.269> your<00:02:15.450> mug<00:02:15.660> we're
