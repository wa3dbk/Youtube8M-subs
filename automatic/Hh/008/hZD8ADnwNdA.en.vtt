00:00:08.409 --> 00:00:10.299
 hello you can new business 

00:00:10.299 --> 00:00:13.299
 created for startups i.v winter came 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:16.609
 and now the actual topic was the question 

00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:18.189
 battery charging 

00:00:18.189 --> 00:00:21.050
 if u can ride on different 

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:23.480
 the battery doesn't even notice it 

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:26.289
 then with the arrival of winter you can just go 

00:00:26.289 --> 00:00:28.669
 later not to be pedestrians 

00:00:28.669 --> 00:00:30.879
 in the early hours when the work plan but 

00:00:30.879 --> 00:00:33.350
 planned to be open exactly his 

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:34.730
 by car 

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:36.510
 egor you usually have to 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:38.699
 charge the battery fully and follow 

00:00:38.699 --> 00:00:40.850
 for the degree of charge 

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:43.340
 for this you need to buy the simplest 

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:45.330
 device 

00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:47.970
 digital multimeter 

00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:50.970
 it allows up to a hundredth 

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:53.910
 next march 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:55.590
 project voltage on-board network 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:57.630
 the car 

00:00:57.630 --> 00:00:59.039
 you have to 

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:01.600
 real cars because you need 

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:04.019
 know the tension just so we finally 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:05.820
 onboard network 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:07.090
 she will have to 

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:09.200
 wait a little bit for that election 

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:11.280
 stay in suspense which remains 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:13.100
 after charging generator 

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:15.729
 slept to a normal level all these 

00:01:15.729 --> 00:01:17.720
 soldiers after stopping the car 

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:19.439
 you can replace the voltage on 

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:20.310
 switch 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:22.390
 and about already imagine what 

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:25.080
 degree of charge it possesses 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:27.490
 let's look in order to memorable 

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:27.970
 prizes 

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:31.060
 no need to remove the battery from 

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:31.750
 cars 

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:33.160
 just worth checking out 

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:34.710
 so that all electrical appliances were 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:35.350
 off 

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:37.630
 the ignition turned off to allow consumers 

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:40.320
 which will make adjustments 8 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:41.670
 in meter work 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:44.200
 old in measurements to twenty wolf 

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:45.740
 direct current 

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:48.740
 and measure 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:53.610
 right on the car 

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:57.060
 28 will mean the degree of Togliatti 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:58.500
 about 7 percent 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:00.870
 more detailed dependency table 

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:03.490
 voltage shouts of battery charging 

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:06.330
 You can find on the site auto 3.2 mp in section 

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:07.630
 car charging 

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:10.389
 battery worth noting that measure 

00:02:10.389 --> 00:02:12.769
 necessary at a temperature of 20 

00:02:12.769 --> 00:02:13.579
 degrees 

00:02:13.579 --> 00:02:15.099
 and if you 

00:02:15.099 --> 00:02:17.489
 believe when the temperature drops 

00:02:17.489 --> 00:02:18.329
 introduce 

00:02:18.329 --> 00:02:20.519
 collection factor 

00:02:20.519 --> 00:02:22.679
 this switch follows institutions 

00:02:22.679 --> 00:02:25.129
 because even the manufacturers themselves in the world 

00:02:25.129 --> 00:02:26.110
 commandant's office 

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:27.640
 and exploit 

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:30.640
 no batteries fully charged 

00:02:31.219 --> 00:02:32.799
 order to be exploited 

00:02:32.799 --> 00:02:35.889
 Square Komrat you reduce and its resource 

00:02:36.669 --> 00:02:38.899
 There are many ways to charge 

00:02:38.899 --> 00:02:40.439
 car batteries 

00:02:40.439 --> 00:02:42.459
 most of them are described on our 

00:02:42.459 --> 00:02:43.259
 the site 

00:02:43.259 --> 00:02:45.189
 you can familiarize yourself with them 

00:02:45.189 --> 00:02:48.079
 prefer the page but I'm for 

00:02:48.079 --> 00:02:50.429
 your convenience talked about how 

00:02:50.429 --> 00:02:52.710
 change houses most simply ecologist 

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:54.559
 charge from your competitors 

00:02:54.559 --> 00:02:55.469
 without going into technical 

00:02:55.469 --> 00:02:57.259
 the details 

00:02:57.259 --> 00:03:00.259
 her task with the subtleties of charging 

00:03:01.479 --> 00:03:03.779
 i use one rule which 

00:03:03.779 --> 00:03:06.669
 called robert hours rules 

00:03:06.669 --> 00:03:09.049
 which years you may so know on the site 

00:03:09.049 --> 00:03:10.829
 it says that 

00:03:10.829 --> 00:03:13.159
 you have to charge the battery so much 

00:03:13.159 --> 00:03:15.080
 how much he needs 

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:17.569
 Opera hours yes full charge 

00:03:17.569 --> 00:03:20.149
 if in the case of the battery is now 

00:03:20.149 --> 00:03:23.149
 ten km hour 

00:03:24.259 --> 00:03:26.210
 Gulyaeva worth charging 

00:03:26.210 --> 00:03:29.059
 only 6 1 10 hours 

00:03:29.059 --> 00:03:30.869
 without going into details on the very 

00:03:30.869 --> 00:03:31.399
 business 

00:03:31.399 --> 00:03:34.509
 given the losses are small and fall 

00:03:34.509 --> 00:03:35.149
 strength 

00:03:35.149 --> 00:03:36.959
 how to charge 

00:03:36.959 --> 00:03:39.959
 charging takes about 12 hours 

00:03:40.619 --> 00:03:43.879
 with a current of approximately 5 6 and inflation 

00:03:43.879 --> 00:03:45.519
 at this time it is necessary to follow 

00:03:45.519 --> 00:03:47.799
 temperature avoid eternal 

00:03:47.799 --> 00:03:50.159
 boil let's all the subtleties you can 

00:03:50.159 --> 00:03:52.259
 read on site 

00:03:52.259 --> 00:03:54.649
 Our measurements showed that 

00:03:54.649 --> 00:03:57.179
 the degree of infection of this plant is 70 

00:03:57.179 --> 00:03:58.979
 percent which corresponds 

00:03:58.979 --> 00:04:02.699
 about the disadvantage of 15 a perth hour that is 

00:04:02.699 --> 00:04:04.689
 to restore full August and 

00:04:04.689 --> 00:04:05.959
 follow seamlessly 

00:04:05.959 --> 00:04:07.579
 operating cars 

00:04:07.579 --> 00:04:10.150
 battery winter we need 

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:12.790
 add to it 15 km an hour judging by this 

00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:13.739
 to the rule 

00:04:13.739 --> 00:04:14.479
 what will fit 

00:04:14.479 --> 00:04:18.049
 charging from windows 5a pierre three hours i 

00:04:18.049 --> 00:04:19.389
 I use a powerful charger 

00:04:19.389 --> 00:04:20.459
 can use 

00:04:20.459 --> 00:04:23.979
 any others but keep in mind that power 

00:04:23.979 --> 00:04:26.050
 current showing charger 

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:29.050
 may differ from the present due to 

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:30.819
 use chargers in 

00:04:30.819 --> 00:04:32.029
 cheap measuring 

00:04:32.029 --> 00:04:33.680
 appliances 

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:36.189
 but the data 

00:04:36.189 --> 00:04:38.069
 This charger has 

00:04:38.069 --> 00:04:39.069
 sufficient 

00:04:39.069 --> 00:04:40.569
 exact copy of the meter 

00:04:40.569 --> 00:04:42.699
 and besides that swimsuit meters on

00:04:54.499 --> 00:04:57.610
 connect their communicator 

00:04:57.610 --> 00:04:59.620
 It should be noted that the battery is not 

00:04:59.620 --> 00:05:01.400
 need to remove from the car 

00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:03.680
 because they can break at a construction site 

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:06.020
 what is the rate of the control unit 

00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:08.749

 car body 

00:05:33.439 --> 00:05:35.949
 usually connected to minus if you 

00:05:35.949 --> 00:05:37.209
 will connect back 

00:05:37.209 --> 00:05:39.029
 sequences you can schedule 

00:05:39.029 --> 00:05:41.649
 open it will be pretty unpleasant 

00:05:41.649 --> 00:05:42.999
 for you have the opportunity for

 further focus in volume 2 

00:05:57.009 --> 00:06:00.169
 add gradually

00:06:19.930 --> 00:06:22.389
 and depending on this are needed 

00:06:22.389 --> 00:06:24.560
 charging speed he can either add 

00:06:24.560 --> 00:06:27.909
 either wait 

00:06:27.909 --> 00:06:30.229
 if you leave in the familiar

 volt meter while charging you can 

00:06:32.719 --> 00:06:34.009
 see how

 in the end 

00:07:06.760 --> 00:07:10.119
 you stop at the 16th stage 

00:07:10.119 --> 00:07:11.869
 and charging your communicator will
