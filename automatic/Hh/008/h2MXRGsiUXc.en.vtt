hard<00:00:24.420> like<00:00:24.720> a<00:00:24.900> piece<00:00:25.230> of<00:00:25.350> metal<00:00:25.560> and<00:00:26.390> then<00:00:27.390> you

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:27.510 
hard like a piece of metal and then you

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:30.769 
hard like a piece of metal and then you
make<00:00:27.630> it<00:00:27.750> like<00:00:27.840> a<00:00:27.869> noose<00:00:28.230> around<00:00:29.240> the<00:00:30.240> material

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:30.779 
make it like a noose around the material

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:34.819 
make it like a noose around the material
as<00:00:31.349> you<00:00:31.470> can<00:00:31.679> see<00:00:33.079> basically<00:00:34.079> tightens<00:00:34.530> up<00:00:34.649> on

get<00:01:04.830> up<00:01:04.949> in<00:01:05.070> this<00:01:05.190> thing<00:01:05.430> here<00:01:39.320> that's<00:01:40.320> how<00:01:40.590> you

00:01:40.639 --> 00:01:40.649 
get up in this thing here that's how you

00:01:40.649 --> 00:01:45.490 
get up in this thing here that's how you
do<00:01:40.860> that<00:01:42.440> gives<00:01:43.440> you<00:01:43.530> a<00:01:43.560> full<00:01:43.770> range<00:01:43.800> of<00:01:44.130> motion

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:45.500 
do that gives you a full range of motion

00:01:45.500 --> 00:02:01.150 
do that gives you a full range of motion
your<00:01:46.500> side

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:01.160 

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:05.600 

hopefully<00:02:02.160> you<00:02:02.250> can<00:02:02.340> see<00:02:02.550> that<00:02:02.700> well<00:02:04.610> there's

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:05.610 
hopefully you can see that well there's

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:07.450 
hopefully you can see that well there's
a<00:02:05.670> reason<00:02:06.030> you<00:02:06.120> don't<00:02:06.240> see<00:02:06.540> many<00:02:07.170> of<00:02:07.260> these

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:07.460 
a reason you don't see many of these

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:10.880 
a reason you don't see many of these
it's<00:02:08.460> not<00:02:08.640> a<00:02:08.670> good<00:02:08.880> idea<00:02:08.970> because<00:02:09.709> it<00:02:10.709> looks

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:10.890 
it's not a good idea because it looks

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:13.520 
it's not a good idea because it looks
comfortable<00:02:11.480> and<00:02:12.480> it<00:02:12.690> is<00:02:12.720> comfortable<00:02:13.050> for

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530 
comfortable and it is comfortable for

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:15.140 
comfortable and it is comfortable for
about<00:02:13.860> the<00:02:13.950> first<00:02:14.190> minute<00:02:14.730> or<00:02:14.790> two<00:02:14.850> that

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:15.150 
about the first minute or two that

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:18.860 
about the first minute or two that
you're<00:02:15.240> in<00:02:15.390> there<00:02:16.280> but<00:02:17.510> you<00:02:18.510> lay<00:02:18.690> in<00:02:18.750> there

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:18.870 
you're in there but you lay in there

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:20.990 
you're in there but you lay in there
about<00:02:19.050> ten<00:02:19.200> minutes<00:02:19.490> and<00:02:20.490> it<00:02:20.610> just<00:02:20.790> starts

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:21.000 
about ten minutes and it just starts

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.780 
about ten minutes and it just starts
hurting<00:02:21.270> and<00:02:21.770> it<00:02:22.770> really<00:02:22.950> just<00:02:23.190> pulls<00:02:23.580> at<00:02:23.760> your

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:23.790 
hurting and it really just pulls at your

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:28.100 
hurting and it really just pulls at your
sides<00:02:25.760> I'm<00:02:26.760> gonna<00:02:27.570> try<00:02:27.720> and<00:02:27.780> get<00:02:27.870> in<00:02:27.930> there

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:28.110 
sides I'm gonna try and get in there

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:30.530 
sides I'm gonna try and get in there
with<00:02:28.230> a<00:02:28.320> hammock<00:02:28.590> with<00:02:28.620> you<00:02:29.239> camera<00:02:30.239> in<00:02:30.450> my

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:30.540 
with a hammock with you camera in my

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:32.479 
with a hammock with you camera in my
hand<00:02:30.720> but<00:02:30.959> it<00:02:31.380> really<00:02:31.530> just<00:02:31.620> starts<00:02:32.220> hurting

00:02:32.479 --> 00:02:32.489 
hand but it really just starts hurting

00:02:32.489 --> 00:02:34.010 
hand but it really just starts hurting
after<00:02:32.700> a<00:02:32.760> while<00:02:32.910> and<00:02:33.120> it's<00:02:33.239> really<00:02:33.600> really<00:02:33.930> not

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:34.020 
after a while and it's really really not

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:35.680 
after a while and it's really really not
a<00:02:34.080> good<00:02:34.260> idea<00:02:34.410> you<00:02:34.770> you<00:02:34.950> think<00:02:35.220> it<00:02:35.340> would<00:02:35.520> be

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:35.690 
a good idea you you think it would be

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:38.150 
a good idea you you think it would be
you<00:02:36.690> get<00:02:36.810> full<00:02:37.020> coverage<00:02:37.230> on<00:02:37.500> your<00:02:37.560> body<00:02:37.830> but

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:38.160 
you get full coverage on your body but

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:43.040 
you get full coverage on your body but
it's<00:02:39.120> not<00:02:40.190> good<00:02:41.190> concept<00:02:41.700> you<00:02:42.660> probably<00:02:42.900> just

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:43.050 
it's not good concept you probably just

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:50.360 
it's not good concept you probably just
find<00:02:43.260> a<00:02:43.350> branch<00:02:43.640> and<00:02:48.650> throw<00:02:49.650> your<00:02:49.800> line<00:02:50.010> over

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:50.370 
find a branch and throw your line over

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:51.440 
find a branch and throw your line over
you<00:02:50.550> know<00:02:50.640> you<00:02:50.700> have<00:02:50.970> to<00:02:51.060> worry<00:02:51.180> about<00:02:51.209> two

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:51.450 
you know you have to worry about two

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:54.440 
you know you have to worry about two
trees<00:02:51.690> but<00:02:52.250> it's<00:02:53.250> not<00:02:53.400> to<00:02:53.489> get<00:02:53.610> out<00:02:53.730> of<00:02:53.820> you<00:02:53.880> not

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:54.450 
trees but it's not to get out of you not

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:55.600 
trees but it's not to get out of you not
a<00:02:54.480> good<00:02:54.690> idea

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:55.610
