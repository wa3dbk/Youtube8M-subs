for my work it is very positive and very
important<00:05:35.690> I<00:05:35.840> think<00:05:35.870> to<00:05:36.230> use<00:05:36.530> this<00:05:36.890> system

00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:37.450 
important I think to use this system

00:05:37.450 --> 00:05:42.280 
important I think to use this system
because<00:05:38.450> I<00:05:39.050> used<00:05:39.710> only<00:05:40.450> also<00:05:41.450> the<00:05:41.810> system

00:05:42.280 --> 00:05:42.290 
because I used only also the system

00:05:42.290 --> 00:05:45.640 
because I used only also the system
because<00:05:42.590> I<00:05:42.860> am<00:05:42.980> with<00:05:43.370> migraine<00:05:44.120> and<00:05:44.660> I<00:05:45.320> also

00:05:45.640 --> 00:05:45.650 
because I am with migraine and I also

00:05:45.650 --> 00:05:49.300 
because I am with migraine and I also
used<00:05:46.040> the<00:05:46.580> system<00:05:46.760> SOUTHCOM<00:05:47.540> on<00:05:47.990> your<00:05:48.260> own<00:05:48.350> yes

many so many periods we connect it with
the<00:06:04.910> care<00:06:05.420> day<00:06:05.830> is<00:06:06.830> it<00:06:07.010> better<00:06:07.160> to<00:06:07.280> find<00:06:07.640> a<00:06:07.970> way

00:06:08.170 --> 00:06:08.180 
the care day is it better to find a way

00:06:08.180 --> 00:06:11.680 
the care day is it better to find a way
like<00:06:08.360> this<00:06:08.600> with<00:06:09.410> no<00:06:09.710> merican<00:06:10.430> and<00:06:11.090> then<00:06:11.360> all

00:06:11.680 --> 00:06:11.690 
like this with no merican and then all

00:06:11.690 --> 00:06:14.850 
like this with no merican and then all
those<00:06:11.930> pills<00:06:12.410> and<00:06:12.710> so<00:06:12.860> on<00:06:13.040> oh<00:06:13.280> yes<00:06:13.850> this<00:06:14.510> is

00:06:14.850 --> 00:06:14.860 
those pills and so on oh yes this is

00:06:14.860 --> 00:06:18.970 
those pills and so on oh yes this is
this<00:06:15.860> is<00:06:16.040> a<00:06:16.390> important<00:06:17.390> to<00:06:18.020> use<00:06:18.230> this<00:06:18.710> system

00:06:18.970 --> 00:06:18.980 
this is a important to use this system
