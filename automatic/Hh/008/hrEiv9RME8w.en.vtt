00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:32.759 
of knit one before well what I

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:35.140 
of knit one before well what I
discovered<00:01:33.360> is<00:01:33.780> is<00:01:33.990> that<00:01:34.229> while<00:01:34.500> I<00:01:34.530> was

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:35.150 
discovered is is that while I was

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:37.870 
discovered is is that while I was
knitting<00:01:36.150> this<00:01:36.360> I<00:01:36.689> was<00:01:36.900> doing<00:01:37.170> something<00:01:37.470> that

00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:37.880 
knitting this I was doing something that

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:40.670 
knitting this I was doing something that
Elizabeth<00:01:38.880> Zimmerman<00:01:39.420> talked<00:01:39.689> about<00:01:39.960> in<00:01:40.229> i

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.680 
Elizabeth Zimmerman talked about in i

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:46.639 
Elizabeth Zimmerman talked about in i
believe<00:01:41.520> it<00:01:41.970> was<00:01:42.920> knitting<00:01:43.920> around<00:01:45.649> and

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:46.649 
believe it was knitting around and

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:48.530 
believe it was knitting around and
that's<00:01:46.950> when<00:01:47.310> you're<00:01:47.579> doing<00:01:47.820> a<00:01:47.909> two<00:01:48.299> by<00:01:48.509> two

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:48.540 
that's when you're doing a two by two

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:51.200 
that's when you're doing a two by two
rib<00:01:48.750> or<00:01:49.110> a<00:01:49.170> ribosome<00:01:49.560> court<00:01:50.100> time<00:01:50.369> and<00:01:50.640> you're

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.210 
rib or a ribosome court time and you're

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:55.010 
rib or a ribosome court time and you're
changing<00:01:51.899> colors<00:01:52.350> that<00:01:53.009> instead<00:01:53.520> of<00:01:54.020> doing

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020 
changing colors that instead of doing

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:58.580 
changing colors that instead of doing
the<00:01:55.229> new<00:01:55.439> color<00:01:55.770> in<00:01:56.219> the<00:01:56.909> rib<00:01:57.420> pattern<00:01:57.960> that

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:58.590 
the new color in the rib pattern that

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:00.319 
the new color in the rib pattern that
you<00:01:58.799> actually<00:01:59.009> just<00:01:59.310> knit<00:01:59.850> all<00:02:00.090> the<00:02:00.240> way

00:02:00.319 --> 00:02:00.329 
you actually just knit all the way

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:02.780 
you actually just knit all the way
around<00:02:00.450> and<00:02:01.140> then<00:02:01.170> that<00:02:01.770> way<00:02:01.979> you<00:02:02.009> prevent

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:02.790 
around and then that way you prevent

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:04.999 
around and then that way you prevent
yourself<00:02:03.000> from<00:02:03.240> getting<00:02:03.390> those<00:02:03.810> little<00:02:04.259> color

00:02:04.999 --> 00:02:05.009 
yourself from getting those little color

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:09.320 
yourself from getting those little color
blips<00:02:05.790> or<00:02:06.689> purl<00:02:07.049> bumps<00:02:07.819> which<00:02:08.819> could<00:02:09.060> actually

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:09.330 
blips or purl bumps which could actually

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:11.960 
blips or purl bumps which could actually
look<00:02:09.840> a<00:02:09.899> little<00:02:10.110> odd<00:02:10.319> well

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:11.970 
look a little odd well

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:14.840 
look a little odd well
I<00:02:12.380> happen<00:02:13.380> and<00:02:13.770> I<00:02:13.860> you<00:02:13.920> did<00:02:14.190> this<00:02:14.370> for<00:02:14.580> this<00:02:14.670> and

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:14.850 
I happen and I you did this for this and

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:16.910 
I happen and I you did this for this and
it<00:02:14.910> works<00:02:15.060> very<00:02:15.150> well<00:02:15.390> it<00:02:15.870> doesn't<00:02:16.170> cause<00:02:16.470> the

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:16.920 
it works very well it doesn't cause the

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:20.150 
it works very well it doesn't cause the
stretch<00:02:17.450> to<00:02:18.450> it<00:02:18.480> be<00:02:18.930> interfered<00:02:19.380> with<00:02:19.380> well

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:20.160 
stretch to it be interfered with well

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:23.320 
stretch to it be interfered with well
and<00:02:20.430> I<00:02:20.640> did<00:02:20.880> this<00:02:21.120> and<00:02:21.510> this<00:02:22.470> is<00:02:22.680> the<00:02:22.830> inside

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:23.330 
and I did this and this is the inside

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:26.540 
and I did this and this is the inside
and<00:02:24.330> I<00:02:24.390> think<00:02:24.930> the<00:02:25.020> inside<00:02:25.680> of<00:02:25.710> this<00:02:25.980> is<00:02:26.190> really

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:26.550 
and I think the inside of this is really

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:29.060 
and I think the inside of this is really
really<00:02:26.850> pretty<00:02:27.050> with<00:02:28.050> the<00:02:28.200> actual<00:02:28.620> the<00:02:28.800> purl

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:29.070 
really pretty with the actual the purl

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:31.760 
really pretty with the actual the purl
bump<00:02:29.370> on<00:02:29.550> the<00:02:29.610> outside<00:02:30.180> so<00:02:31.020> the<00:02:31.230> next<00:02:31.410> one<00:02:31.530> that

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:31.770 
bump on the outside so the next one that

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:34.100 
bump on the outside so the next one that
I<00:02:31.800> knit<00:02:32.130> I'm<00:02:32.850> probably<00:02:33.210> i'm<00:02:33.600> going<00:02:33.810> to<00:02:33.870> do<00:02:33.990> this

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:34.110 
I knit I'm probably i'm going to do this

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:37.070 
I knit I'm probably i'm going to do this
on<00:02:34.290> purpose<00:02:34.880> on<00:02:35.880> the<00:02:36.090> outside<00:02:36.540> I<00:02:36.600> can't<00:02:36.900> do

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:37.080 
on purpose on the outside I can't do

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:38.720 
on purpose on the outside I can't do
this<00:02:37.110> on<00:02:37.440> the<00:02:37.530> inside<00:02:37.650> because<00:02:37.950> lucky<00:02:38.580> you

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:38.730 
this on the inside because lucky you

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:40.550 
this on the inside because lucky you
know<00:02:38.820> we've<00:02:38.970> got<00:02:39.150> the<00:02:39.300> little<00:02:39.450> you<00:02:40.170> can<00:02:40.350> see

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:40.560 
know we've got the little you can see

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:44.300 
know we've got the little you can see
that<00:02:40.590> little<00:02:41.130> itty-bitty<00:02:42.380> pieces<00:02:43.380> of<00:02:43.740> running

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:44.310 
that little itty-bitty pieces of running

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:46.940 
that little itty-bitty pieces of running
in<00:02:44.459> so<00:02:45.120> I<00:02:45.360> think<00:02:45.480> it<00:02:45.900> will<00:02:46.080> just<00:02:46.320> be<00:02:46.410> darling

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:46.950 
in so I think it will just be darling

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:50.900 
in so I think it will just be darling
that<00:02:47.640> way<00:02:48.410> and<00:02:49.410> again<00:02:49.709> this<00:02:49.890> was<00:02:50.130> knit<00:02:50.370> using

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:50.910 
that way and again this was knit using

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:54.500 
that way and again this was knit using
Rowan<00:02:51.330> calmer<00:02:52.020> which<00:02:52.770> is<00:02:53.040> cotton<00:02:53.730> and<00:02:54.000> acrylic

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:55.890 
which I think will be very appropriate
