00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:07.930
 4 hi high wrc 5 

00:00:04.250 --> 00:00:07.930
 Yes. 

00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:17.340
 U 

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:25.040
 Hello, I would like to coach the Samsung Thunders basketball team 

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:31.330
 Samsung sports basketball less This lecture is frontal layup 

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:31.330
 Yes, let's look at what I'm going to do when I get back from retirement. 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:39.480
 This is a game where players sometimes play games. 

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:42.840
 It has been a driving issue in the House Tower mothamyeo to us face to face 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:49.440
 There's a very vague case going into it. 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:51.900
 Because it would really put the defense raised in other states or out 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:56.730
 Would you use it with backs? 

00:00:51.900 --> 00:01:01.260
 This is a great many, if I hesitated a great addition sagging stores in floating status 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:05.010
 So basically, you do not get locked up in the front 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:09.630
 Nearest to the lean towards the store 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:13.049
 Then to put the ball patchouli same party but will become a primary 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:14.250
 I would turn my own a little less tall plants Can I know the basic government 

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:17.520
 Show me 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:21.450
 The same is true of the left and right sides . 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:24.829
 The wieda so not a bank shot, but it fit the baekbo safe 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:24.829
 Relax'll put it 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:44.340
 This behavior is a layer palttae time earlier that enter at a 45 degree 

00:01:38.789 --> 00:01:49.020
 Pussy willow enter only when such behavior more precisely than me going to match 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:52.740
 It's like if my brother can board 100 is roughly rectangular in line 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:55.319
 The properties that you can get fit to play, but let's put it seized Yan 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:59.459
 If you do not get into it, you make a trait. 

00:01:55.319 --> 00:02:02.030
 This has to take full advantage of the jump and then the touch is great 

00:01:59.459 --> 00:02:02.030
 I mean it 's important. 

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:13.270
 Oh, of course 

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:18.430
 In the case of using the backboard also get you there in the border 

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:22.240
 Thing get stable when the defense tell beuroken this somehow slow motion 

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:22.780
 In such a case, you have to throw 100 puzzles 

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:26.980
 There is 

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:28.819
 Such behavior is tossed in advance if you put a case to be brought to the Party 's two q5 

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:30.390
 I will. 

00:02:28.819 --> 00:02:32.390
 Ah 

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:32.390
 U 

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:47.330
 But in order to have accurate shooting, but sooner front and twenty-five days 

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:48.680
 Confucius, who sets it earlier than 100, 

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:53.090
 I will be in position. 

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:56.840
 Neundeyo now going to be a reverse smell of the activity in doing what you're Andy 

00:02:53.090 --> 00:03:00.530
 - many of the players, Andy rich language caress the microphone two months or curve Life 

00:02:56.840 --> 00:03:06.670
 If the introduction of a defense is very much out of the statue in resuscitation 

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:06.670
 But the seventh grade on this car is that the weak point is that you have to be here. 

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:14.560
 In situations without jump, you can take as many as you like at any time 

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:16.510
 But the score is low because it increases the chances of being blocked by the opponent. 

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:18.980
 Look 

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:23.050
 There are two things. 

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:25.350
 If you go in and shoot with your left hand 

00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:25.350
 then 

00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:32.319
 If you can write with your right hand 

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:36.069
 But in fact this is not so important because now you are confident 

00:03:32.319 --> 00:03:38.439
 Because it is important to remember the accuracy when you shoot with your hand, 

00:03:36.069 --> 00:03:43.560
 I never thought it was so important 

00:03:38.439 --> 00:03:43.560
 But I have a timing to tell you from now on . 

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:51.370
 The jump does not mean that only two mana reverse layup because 

00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:57.200
 If you take away only salim 

00:03:51.370 --> 00:04:02.120
 This is also the case when you are in a defensive position and you can move in reverse . 

00:03:57.200 --> 00:04:06.620
 Of course, if you jump from a state of perfect joy, 

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:11.060
 Maybe there's something I wish I either very weak, small key concern sseopeul 

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:14.090
 If you collapse, you can not do enough for even 

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:20.180
 But that 's the timing I told you before. 

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:21.470
 In front of the yard in front of the operation to throw throws , as long as you go across 

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:26.030
 The number was 

00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:31.630
 If you can not afford to pre-opened as opposed to too principled 

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:31.630
 But if you use motion, you have a chance to reverse 

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:51.430
 Do not think too hard on the other side 

00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:55.450
 This is also zest to make it the most important thing that we have a lot of self-discipline 

00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:59.110
 If something once or twice a year is something many players or you have a multi-multi-It 

00:04:55.450 --> 00:05:00.970
 What geolro no one thought much self-discipline and unconditional as to be ridiculous 

00:04:59.110 --> 00:05:04.980
 Take-weapon 

00:05:00.970 --> 00:05:04.980
 I think you need to do a lot of 7 years.
