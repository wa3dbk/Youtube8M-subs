00:00:31.540 --> 00:00:31.550 
they're very similar to blackheads but

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:33.309 
they're very similar to blackheads but
the<00:00:31.670> difference<00:00:32.029> is<00:00:32.210> that<00:00:32.479> instead<00:00:32.780> of<00:00:32.960> the

00:00:33.309 --> 00:00:33.319 
the difference is that instead of the

00:00:33.319 --> 00:00:36.119 
the difference is that instead of the
poor<00:00:34.069> being<00:00:34.249> completely<00:00:34.729> blocked<00:00:34.999> by<00:00:35.149> oil

poor being completely blocked by oil

00:00:36.129 --> 00:00:38.829 
poor being completely blocked by oil
there<00:00:37.129> is<00:00:37.159> there<00:00:37.909> it's<00:00:38.179> not<00:00:38.420> completely

00:00:38.829 --> 00:00:38.839 
there is there it's not completely

00:00:38.839 --> 00:00:41.079 
there is there it's not completely
blocked<00:00:39.109> instead<00:00:39.920> there<00:00:40.219> is<00:00:40.249> a<00:00:40.399> little<00:00:40.789> bit<00:00:40.940> of

00:00:41.079 --> 00:00:41.089 
blocked instead there is a little bit of

00:00:41.089 --> 00:00:43.629 
blocked instead there is a little bit of
bacteria<00:00:41.569> within<00:00:41.749> that<00:00:42.050> that<00:00:42.620> pore<00:00:42.979> and<00:00:43.280> it's

00:00:43.629 --> 00:00:43.639 
bacteria within that that pore and it's

00:00:43.639 --> 00:00:46.149 
bacteria within that that pore and it's
causing<00:00:44.030> a<00:00:44.059> small<00:00:44.479> amount<00:00:44.780> of<00:00:44.960> pasta<00:00:45.170> form<00:00:45.589> not

causing a small amount of pasta form not

00:00:46.159 --> 00:00:48.340 
causing a small amount of pasta form not
enough<00:00:46.429> to<00:00:46.549> cause<00:00:46.729> an<00:00:46.940> infection<00:00:47.510> and<00:00:47.629> you

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:48.350 
enough to cause an infection and you

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:50.799 
enough to cause an infection and you
know<00:00:48.440> redness<00:00:49.039> and<00:00:49.190> information<00:00:49.699> ie<00:00:50.269> a<00:00:50.420> proper

00:00:50.799 --> 00:00:50.809 
know redness and information ie a proper

00:00:50.809 --> 00:00:52.959 
know redness and information ie a proper
spot<00:00:51.079> but<00:00:51.709> enough<00:00:51.979> to<00:00:52.159> be<00:00:52.249> able<00:00:52.339> to<00:00:52.489> see<00:00:52.729> a

00:00:52.959 --> 00:00:52.969 
spot but enough to be able to see a

00:00:52.969 --> 00:00:55.299 
spot but enough to be able to see a
little<00:00:53.359> bit<00:00:53.600> of<00:00:53.780> pass<00:00:54.559> at<00:00:54.739> the<00:00:54.799> surface<00:00:55.129> which

00:00:55.299 --> 00:00:55.309 
little bit of pass at the surface which

00:00:55.309 --> 00:00:57.299 
little bit of pass at the surface which
is<00:00:55.459> the<00:00:55.819> white<00:00:56.030> lid<00:00:56.269> of<00:00:56.389> the<00:00:56.510> head<00:00:56.719> if<00:00:56.870> you<00:00:56.989> like

00:00:57.299 --> 00:00:57.309 
is the white lid of the head if you like

00:00:57.309 --> 00:01:00.789 
is the white lid of the head if you like
so<00:00:58.309> the<00:00:58.729> main<00:00:58.909> thing<00:00:59.179> is<00:00:59.329> to<00:00:59.359> produce<00:00:59.899> the<00:01:00.350> oil

00:01:00.789 --> 00:01:00.799 
so the main thing is to produce the oil

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:03.459 
so the main thing is to produce the oil
production<00:01:01.159> and<00:01:01.639> reduce<00:01:02.030> the<00:01:02.600> blocked<00:01:03.109> pores

00:01:03.459 --> 00:01:03.469 
production and reduce the blocked pores

00:01:03.469 --> 00:01:07.390 
production and reduce the blocked pores
so<00:01:04.309> you<00:01:04.850> need<00:01:05.030> to<00:01:05.180> wash<00:01:05.930> regularly<00:01:06.650> if<00:01:07.070> you<00:01:07.220> can

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:07.400 
so you need to wash regularly if you can

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:10.720 
so you need to wash regularly if you can
use<00:01:07.720> exfoliating<00:01:08.720> wash<00:01:09.200> every<00:01:10.160> day<00:01:10.190> that's

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:10.730 
use exfoliating wash every day that's

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:11.590 
use exfoliating wash every day that's

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:14.110 
perfect

but<00:02:26.690> I<00:02:26.780> don't<00:02:27.020> recommend<00:02:27.350> because<00:02:27.860> they

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:27.980 
but I don't recommend because they

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:30.729 
but I don't recommend because they
should<00:02:28.190> go<00:02:28.370> by<00:02:28.730> themselves<00:02:29.390> then<00:02:30.170> please<00:02:30.440> do

00:02:30.729 --> 00:02:30.739 
should go by themselves then please do

00:02:30.739 --> 00:02:33.190 
should go by themselves then please do
it<00:02:30.890> after<00:02:31.250> a<00:02:31.519> hot<00:02:31.940> bath<00:02:32.150> or<00:02:32.390> shower<00:02:32.420> and<00:02:32.930> use

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:33.200 
it after a hot bath or shower and use

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:34.870 
it after a hot bath or shower and use
clean<00:02:33.500> hands<00:02:33.950> and<00:02:34.070> the<00:02:34.130> short<00:02:34.340> fingernails

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:34.880 
clean hands and the short fingernails

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:38.380 
clean hands and the short fingernails
and<00:02:35.239> just<00:02:36.200> do<00:02:36.890> it<00:02:37.010> very<00:02:37.160> very<00:02:37.400> carefully<00:02:37.880> but

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:38.390 
and just do it very very carefully but

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:39.970 
and just do it very very carefully but
you<00:02:38.480> might<00:02:38.690> risk<00:02:39.019> getting<00:02:39.440> making<00:02:39.890> the

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:39.980 
you might risk getting making the

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:42.759 
you might risk getting making the
whiteheads<00:02:40.459> worse<00:02:41.230> so<00:02:42.230> I<00:02:42.260> hope<00:02:42.440> this<00:02:42.560> has<00:02:42.739> been

00:02:42.759 --> 00:02:42.769 
whiteheads worse so I hope this has been
