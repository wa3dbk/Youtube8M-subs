00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:13.610 
I used to set them last night was just
water<00:04:10.110> and<00:04:11.360> the<00:04:12.360> Kimmy<00:04:12.750> to<00:04:12.930> believe<00:04:13.110> in<00:04:13.200> recipe

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:13.620 
water and the Kimmy to believe in recipe

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:15.590 
water and the Kimmy to believe in recipe

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:15.600 
so it's really soft it's really

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:18.830 
so it's really soft it's really
moisturized<00:04:16.200> I<00:04:16.620> really<00:04:17.400> really<00:04:17.580> like<00:04:17.730> it<00:04:17.840> for

00:04:18.830 --> 00:04:18.840 
moisturized I really really like it for

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:20.180 
moisturized I really really like it for
me<00:04:18.959> this<00:04:19.170> is<00:04:19.230> as<00:04:19.470> good<00:04:19.500> as<00:04:19.770> I<00:04:19.830> can<00:04:19.890> get<00:04:20.100> like

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:20.190 
me this is as good as I can get like

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:21.949 
me this is as good as I can get like
with<00:04:20.370> a<00:04:20.400> twist<00:04:20.760> out<00:04:20.910> because<00:04:21.090> my<00:04:21.150> hair<00:04:21.690> is<00:04:21.720> kind

00:04:21.949 --> 00:04:21.959 
with a twist out because my hair is kind

00:04:21.959 --> 00:04:24.950 
with a twist out because my hair is kind
of<00:04:22.049> fine<00:04:22.260> and<00:04:22.730> I<00:04:23.730> just<00:04:24.360> have<00:04:24.630> a<00:04:24.660> lot<00:04:24.720> of

00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:24.960 
of fine and I just have a lot of

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:27.080 
of fine and I just have a lot of
evidence<00:04:25.200> normally<00:04:26.190> don't<00:04:26.460> give<00:04:26.670> me<00:04:26.820> a<00:04:26.850> lot<00:04:27.000> of

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:27.090 
evidence normally don't give me a lot of

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:30.110 
evidence normally don't give me a lot of
volume<00:04:27.270> they<00:04:27.480> just<00:04:27.630> kind<00:04:27.750> of<00:04:27.810> lie<00:04:28.250> I'm<00:04:29.250> so<00:04:29.910> if<00:04:30.030> I

00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:30.120 
volume they just kind of lie I'm so if I

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:33.740 
volume they just kind of lie I'm so if I
want<00:04:30.360> more<00:04:31.290> volume<00:04:31.530> than<00:04:32.010> I<00:04:32.490> do<00:04:32.640> flat<00:04:33.390> twists

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:33.750 
want more volume than I do flat twists

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:35.150 
want more volume than I do flat twists
and<00:04:34.380> it<00:04:34.410> seems<00:04:34.620> like<00:04:34.680> they're<00:04:34.860> getting<00:04:34.950> better

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:35.160 
and it seems like they're getting better

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:43.180 
and it seems like they're getting better
so<00:04:35.520> once<00:04:36.090> again<00:04:36.210> this<00:04:36.900> is<00:04:36.960> how<00:04:37.140> it<00:04:37.290> looks

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:43.190 

00:04:43.190 --> 00:04:48.530
