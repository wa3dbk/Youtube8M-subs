00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
them don't dwell so much on the boat

00:00:57.690 --> 00:00:59.510 
them don't dwell so much on the boat
docks<00:00:57.960> themselves<00:00:58.590> is<00:00:58.739> where<00:00:59.010> they<00:00:59.250> ship

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520 
docks themselves is where they ship

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:01.130 
docks themselves is where they ship
where<00:00:59.730> the<00:00:59.760> fish<00:01:00.090> should<00:01:00.329> be<00:01:00.390> without<00:01:00.719> them

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
where the fish should be without them

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:03.080 
where the fish should be without them
and<00:01:01.320> then<00:01:01.770> because<00:01:02.160> there's<00:01:02.460> a<00:01:02.520> docks<00:01:02.789> there

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.090 
and then because there's a docks there

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:05.240 
and then because there's a docks there
it's<00:01:03.510> going<00:01:03.690> to<00:01:03.780> attract<00:01:04.110> even<00:01:04.320> more<00:01:04.470> fish<00:01:04.949> and

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
it's going to attract even more fish and

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:07.340 
it's going to attract even more fish and
it's<00:01:05.610> going<00:01:05.820> to<00:01:05.939> concentrate<00:01:06.360> them<00:01:06.750> in<00:01:06.869> places

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
it's going to concentrate them in places

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:09.320 
it's going to concentrate them in places
it's<00:01:07.830> gonna<00:01:08.070> make<00:01:08.250> it<00:01:08.369> easier<00:01:08.700> for<00:01:08.760> you<00:01:09.090> to

of their nose but as it gets a little
colder<00:01:14.040> now<00:01:14.220> and<00:01:14.400> that<00:01:14.520> water<00:01:14.700> temperature

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:14.939 
colder now and that water temperature

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:20.210 
colder now and that water temperature
drops<00:01:15.450> down<00:01:15.810> then<00:01:16.530> I'll<00:01:16.710> go<00:01:17.030> to<00:01:18.030> a<00:01:18.770> brown<00:01:19.770> jig

get<00:01:50.369> some<00:01:51.149> of<00:01:51.210> those<00:01:51.270> fish<00:01:51.479> to<00:01:51.600> get<00:01:51.720> out<00:01:51.869> in<00:01:51.960> 25

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:52.320 
get some of those fish to get out in 25

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:54.440 
get some of those fish to get out in 25
foot<00:01:52.560> of<00:01:52.649> water<00:01:52.860> so<00:01:53.220> you<00:01:53.430> don't<00:01:54.000> want<00:01:54.119> to<00:01:54.180> limit

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:54.450 
foot of water so you don't want to limit

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:56.149 
foot of water so you don't want to limit
yourself<00:01:54.570> on<00:01:55.049> this<00:01:55.170> lake<00:01:55.500> and<00:01:55.740> some<00:01:55.920> lakes

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:56.159 
yourself on this lake and some lakes

00:01:56.159 --> 00:01:57.889 
yourself on this lake and some lakes
they'll<00:01:56.430> get<00:01:56.610> even<00:01:56.880> deeper<00:01:57.210> than<00:01:57.240> that<00:01:57.360> so

00:01:57.889 --> 00:01:57.899 
they'll get even deeper than that so

00:01:57.899 --> 00:01:59.959 
they'll get even deeper than that so
just<00:01:58.560> because<00:01:58.710> a<00:01:58.860> boat<00:01:59.159> dock<00:01:59.369> sitting<00:01:59.759> over

00:01:59.959 --> 00:01:59.969 
just because a boat dock sitting over

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:01.429 
just because a boat dock sitting over
deep<00:02:00.149> water<00:02:00.420> doesn't<00:02:00.719> mean<00:02:00.899> it<00:02:01.049> won't<00:02:01.140> catch

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:01.439 
deep water doesn't mean it won't catch

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:04.609 
deep water doesn't mean it won't catch
fish<00:02:01.770> and<00:02:02.100> we've<00:02:02.939> got<00:02:03.119> some<00:02:03.509> boat<00:02:04.350> docks

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:04.619 
fish and we've got some boat docks

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:07.370 
fish and we've got some boat docks
that'll<00:02:04.920> actually<00:02:05.040> sit<00:02:05.520> over<00:02:05.790> 45<00:02:06.719> 50<00:02:07.140> foot<00:02:07.350> of

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:07.380 
that'll actually sit over 45 50 foot of

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:09.979 
that'll actually sit over 45 50 foot of
water<00:02:07.649> and<00:02:08.580> they<00:02:08.879> may<00:02:09.060> not<00:02:09.209> be<00:02:09.270> on<00:02:09.509> the<00:02:09.539> bottom

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:09.989 
water and they may not be on the bottom

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:11.720 
water and they may not be on the bottom
under<00:02:10.229> those<00:02:10.379> docks<00:02:10.770> and<00:02:11.039> what<00:02:11.160> they'll<00:02:11.310> do<00:02:11.489> so

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:11.730 
under those docks and what they'll do so

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:13.790 
under those docks and what they'll do so
suspend<00:02:12.239> right<00:02:12.450> underneath<00:02:12.720> the<00:02:12.930> styrofoam

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:13.800 
suspend right underneath the styrofoam

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:17.750 
suspend right underneath the styrofoam
and<00:02:13.980> then<00:02:14.250> you<00:02:14.400> can<00:02:14.490> take<00:02:14.610> a<00:02:14.670> little<00:02:15.320> 1.5<00:02:16.320> a<00:02:16.830> 2.5

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:17.760 
and then you can take a little 1.5 a 2.5

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:20.180 
and then you can take a little 1.5 a 2.5
and<00:02:18.030> just<00:02:18.210> run<00:02:18.420> along<00:02:18.510> the<00:02:18.840> sides<00:02:19.110> and<00:02:19.560> catch<00:02:20.070> a

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:20.190 
and just run along the sides and catch a

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:22.430 
and just run along the sides and catch a
lot<00:02:20.340> of<00:02:20.370> fish<00:02:20.610> doing<00:02:20.910> that<00:02:21.210> or<00:02:21.480> swim<00:02:21.960> a<00:02:21.990> jig<00:02:22.320> if

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:22.440 
lot of fish doing that or swim a jig if

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:24.740 
lot of fish doing that or swim a jig if
you<00:02:22.590> want<00:02:22.770> to<00:02:22.860> swim<00:02:23.610> a<00:02:23.640> jig<00:02:24.000> that<00:02:24.390> can<00:02:24.570> be<00:02:24.660> an

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:24.750 
you want to swim a jig that can be an

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:27.470 
you want to swim a jig that can be an
effective<00:02:25.020> technique
