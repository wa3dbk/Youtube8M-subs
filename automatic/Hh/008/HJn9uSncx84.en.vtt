00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:16.040
 or to all of you who are such I am alves 

00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:19.820
 phillips in a new video this time from 

00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:23.510
 a tutorial on how to install skins in 

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:26.860
 our gta san andreas a long time ago 

00:00:23.510 --> 00:00:26.860
 I did time 

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:34.300
 a couple of videos on an analysis of 

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:36.940
 skins 

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:38.559
 of this game and it turns out that one then 

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:41.290
 there were many people who had certain 

00:00:38.559 --> 00:00:43.390
 installation problems and other good 

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:47.620
 because today I'm going to teach it to the simple 

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:50.810
 which is just installing these skins 

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:53.070
 good first 

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:56.370
 d 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:59.460
 from the time I climbed the skins 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:02.090
 ok you already have the links and well there I 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:03.930
 I have the skis on 

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:08.190
 of superheroes 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:10.800
 good, well, we just take it 

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:14.220
 example the script ok 

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:16.710
 we take and its interior will not be where 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:19.070
 let's have our gta san game 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:19.070
 andreas 

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:24.810
 and here 

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:28.990
 and we put where our clergy folder 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:31.210
 the clergy tells you the official page 

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:34.680
 you download the latest version you can 

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:37.450
 that are not the same then I have 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:39.100
 first adapt and others what 

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:41.680
 that they must pay if you already have or promised 

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:45.759
 in case it's nothing you copy it and already 

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:48.009
 is here and yes it is ok and we are going to copy the 

00:01:45.759 --> 00:01:50.420
 cornerback and now we're going to 

00:01:48.009 --> 00:01:53.060
 check it 

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:56.680
 clear what I have the heroes 

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:58.610
 already writes and another that is a mix of a 

00:01:56.680 --> 00:02:00.049
 continent 

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:02.210
 well then let's go to our game san 

00:02:00.049 --> 00:02:06.960
 andreas 

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:10.350
 here we see that we have is that img is that 

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:14.160
 it is simply that which is the only thing 

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:16.489
 that modifies we get our big 

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:16.489
 car 

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:23.620
 and let's go to it 

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:27.300
 and now as well as what buttons do you have to 

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:27.300
 give him to do it 

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:31.720
 and they are loaded 

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:33.220
 you see that you die of it is a 

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:37.319
 something simpler but good shooter 

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:41.180
 I said I would do it and well, here it is 

00:02:37.319 --> 00:02:41.180
 all those people who could not do it 

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:48.610
 all right 

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:51.060
 in a second you get the sound 

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:51.060
 but 

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:09.530
 and good now we have our character 

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:11.300
 on the screen is very simple because 

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:14.930
 many things explain the comments and 

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:20.120
 they do not understand it well here we have nico 

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:21.830
 you can not take it the key is that 

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:24.560
 is the one that is right next to the one 

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:26.930
 press tap and will not leave this box 

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:29.990
 icons that are those of the controls 

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:33.170
 games cut the button cook is to change 

00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:35.630
 a weapon and we move a hair from below and 

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:37.280
 the mouse roulette you see how you see 

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:40.790
 we have here the box for the selection 

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:43.340
 of skins and even clothes and other 

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:44.540
 well then you see what I put and that's worth not 

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:46.280
 you listen to him because it is that I have it 

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:48.110
 put for the command we keep saying 

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:52.100
 with the keyboard but good I have it for 

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:56.000
 keyboard we press the space bar and 

00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:57.980
 You see all these times to come 

00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:00.830
 cash to select each of them 

00:03:57.980 --> 00:04:03.470
 we give again space bar and 

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:06.470
 is already here and we are going down with the arrow 

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:09.320
 and one another and another and so we go 

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:12.110
 selecting each one of the skins like this 

00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:14.720
 of simple and that simple when 

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:18.079
 let's have one let's choose one so 

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:20.320
 is cool to look like this the ryder sack the 

00:04:18.079 --> 00:04:20.320
 baby 

00:04:22.139 --> 00:04:29.940
 for example this one or here 

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:33.420
 light and high and black we give to 

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:36.200
 enter already between again it is already this way of 

00:04:33.420 --> 00:04:39.960
 simple we have our skin 

00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:42.530
 placed and pretty cool good 

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:49.660
 I hope this video helped you 

00:04:42.530 --> 00:04:52.590
 that really something has already been helpful 

00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:55.410
 to all those who 

00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:57.780
 that you can not use skins and good 

00:04:55.410 --> 00:05:00.360
 we must 

00:04:57.780 --> 00:05:01.590
 in the next video you do not know how to do it 

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:03.150
 because it took me a long time to do it with 

00:05:01.590 --> 00:05:05.910
 certain problems that I had 

00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:10.139
 so he regretted the delay to everyone to 

00:05:05.910 --> 00:05:15.110
