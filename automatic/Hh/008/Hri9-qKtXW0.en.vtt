00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:08.570 

okay<00:00:06.120> so<00:00:06.180> that<00:00:06.479> gives<00:00:06.720> you<00:00:06.839> one<00:00:07.170> idea<00:00:07.580> using

00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:08.580 
okay so that gives you one idea using

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:11.930 
okay so that gives you one idea using
this<00:00:09.030> shape<00:00:09.360> here<00:00:09.809> of<00:00:09.990> your<00:00:10.559> G<00:00:10.860> chord<00:00:10.940> and

00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:11.940 
this shape here of your G chord and

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:13.400 
this shape here of your G chord and
obviously<00:00:12.420> you<00:00:12.539> saw<00:00:12.779> that<00:00:12.959> we<00:00:13.049> could<00:00:13.230> move

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:13.410 
obviously you saw that we could move

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:15.439 
obviously you saw that we could move
that<00:00:13.680> to<00:00:13.889> match<00:00:14.129> the<00:00:14.609> chords<00:00:14.969> as<00:00:15.090> they<00:00:15.240> move

00:00:15.439 --> 00:00:15.449 
that to match the chords as they move

00:00:15.449 --> 00:00:17.150 
that to match the chords as they move
through<00:00:15.660> the<00:00:15.779> progression<00:00:16.260> all<00:00:16.590> three<00:00:16.980> of<00:00:17.070> the

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:17.160 
through the progression all three of the

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:19.790 
through the progression all three of the
cause<00:00:17.369> the<00:00:17.580> major<00:00:17.850> chords<00:00:18.420> and<00:00:18.630> they<00:00:19.500> have<00:00:19.650> the

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:19.800 
cause the major chords and they have the

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:21.499 
cause the major chords and they have the
major<00:00:19.980> third<00:00:20.369> in<00:00:20.579> that<00:00:20.759> we're<00:00:20.880> using<00:00:21.119> in<00:00:21.390> this

00:00:21.499 --> 00:00:21.509 
major third in that we're using in this

00:00:21.509 --> 00:00:23.749 
major third in that we're using in this
lick<00:00:21.779> -<00:00:22.019> right<00:00:22.980> that's<00:00:23.189> great<00:00:23.429> information

00:00:23.749 --> 00:00:23.759 
lick - right that's great information

00:00:23.759 --> 00:00:26.419 
lick - right that's great information
here<00:00:24.269> let's<00:00:25.079> give<00:00:25.289> you<00:00:25.380> another<00:00:25.409> idea<00:00:26.159> moving

00:00:26.419 --> 00:00:26.429 
here let's give you another idea moving

00:00:26.429 --> 00:00:28.729 
here let's give you another idea moving
up<00:00:26.759> the<00:00:26.909> fretboard<00:00:27.179> alright<00:00:28.079> so<00:00:28.349> now<00:00:28.529> we're

00:00:28.729 --> 00:00:28.739 
up the fretboard alright so now we're

00:00:28.739 --> 00:00:31.189 
up the fretboard alright so now we're
going<00:00:28.769> to<00:00:28.949> be<00:00:29.099> working<00:00:29.359> at<00:00:30.359> the<00:00:30.599> eighth<00:00:30.810> fret

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:31.199 
going to be working at the eighth fret

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:34.090 
going to be working at the eighth fret
and<00:00:31.560> I'm<00:00:32.040> referencing<00:00:32.460> the<00:00:32.880> a<00:00:32.910> threat<00:00:33.540> because

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:34.100 
and I'm referencing the a threat because

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:36.670 
and I'm referencing the a threat because
I'm<00:00:35.100> referencing<00:00:35.460> the<00:00:35.850> eighth<00:00:35.970> fret<00:00:36.239> because

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:36.680 
I'm referencing the eighth fret because

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:39.860 
I'm referencing the eighth fret because
here's<00:00:37.680> my<00:00:37.920> G<00:00:38.280> at<00:00:38.550> the<00:00:38.820> eighth<00:00:38.940> fret<00:00:39.300> let's

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:39.870 
here's my G at the eighth fret let's

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:41.180 
here's my G at the eighth fret let's
look<00:00:40.080> at<00:00:40.200> the<00:00:40.290> chord<00:00:40.530> shape<00:00:40.830> that<00:00:41.040> I'm

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:41.190 
look at the chord shape that I'm

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:44.480 
look at the chord shape that I'm
deriving<00:00:42.120> my<00:00:42.600> ideas<00:00:43.080> from<00:00:43.320> and<00:00:43.710> it's<00:00:44.160> a<00:00:44.280> D

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:44.490 
deriving my ideas from and it's a D

00:00:44.490 --> 00:00:48.410 
deriving my ideas from and it's a D
shape<00:00:45.140> here<00:00:46.140> and<00:00:46.380> there's<00:00:47.040> you<00:00:47.190> D<00:00:47.460> and<00:00:48.180> then<00:00:48.300> if

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
shape here and there's you D and then if

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:52.370 
shape here and there's you D and then if
you<00:00:48.540> move<00:00:48.750> that<00:00:48.780> that<00:00:49.440> becomes<00:00:49.740> e<00:00:49.920> f<00:00:50.550> g<00:00:51.380> alright

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:52.380 
you move that that becomes e f g alright

00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:53.950 
you move that that becomes e f g alright
so<00:00:52.650> there's<00:00:52.830> my<00:00:53.040> g<00:00:53.280> chord

00:00:53.950 --> 00:00:53.960 
so there's my g chord

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:56.540 
so there's my g chord
now<00:00:54.960> what<00:00:55.110> I'm<00:00:55.230> gonna<00:00:55.350> do<00:00:55.650> so<00:00:56.280> I'm<00:00:56.340> going<00:00:56.460> to

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770 
show you a great lick that's derived

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:01.580 
show you a great lick that's derived
from<00:00:58.980> the<00:00:59.250> G<00:00:59.520> Major<00:00:59.790> scale<00:01:00.140> let<00:01:01.140> me<00:01:01.230> just<00:01:01.410> play

00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:41.240 
there's my G route lower than my

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:42.870 
there's my G route lower than my
reference<00:01:41.810> note<00:01:42.110> that<00:01:42.290> I<00:01:42.350> showed<00:01:42.620> you<00:01:42.650> here

some of you guys I know a lot of guys
have<00:01:46.310> learnt<00:01:47.500> modal<00:01:48.500> shapes<00:01:49.490> and<00:01:50.180> patterns

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:50.510 
have learnt modal shapes and patterns

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:52.720 
have learnt modal shapes and patterns

and a lot of you guys probably refer to

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:56.770 
and a lot of you guys probably refer to
that<00:01:52.940> shape<00:01:53.360> as<00:01:53.600> a<00:01:53.660> Phrygian<00:01:54.110> shape<00:01:55.720> it's<00:01:56.720> not

00:01:56.770 --> 00:01:56.780 
that shape as a Phrygian shape it's not

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:58.630 
that shape as a Phrygian shape it's not
really<00:01:57.200> the<00:01:57.320> correct<00:01:57.560> way<00:01:57.770> of<00:01:57.800> terminology

00:01:58.630 --> 00:01:58.640 
really the correct way of terminology

00:01:58.640 --> 00:01:59.110 
really the correct way of terminology
with<00:01:58.820> it

00:01:59.110 --> 00:01:59.120 
with it

00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:03.010 
with it
it's<00:01:59.240> a<00:01:59.450> G<00:01:59.660> major<00:01:59.900> scale<00:02:01.360> but<00:02:02.360> anyway<00:02:02.690> we<00:02:02.900> won't

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:03.020 
it's a G major scale but anyway we won't

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:05.050 
it's a G major scale but anyway we won't
get<00:02:03.260> into<00:02:03.410> that<00:02:03.590> but<00:02:03.950> you<00:02:04.310> you<00:02:04.610> may<00:02:04.790> reference

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:05.060 
get into that but you you may reference

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:07.390 
get into that but you you may reference
that<00:02:05.450> shape<00:02:05.870> in<00:02:06.200> that<00:02:06.260> manner<00:02:06.830> if<00:02:07.040> you<00:02:07.190> do

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:07.400 
that shape in that manner if you do

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:08.620 
that shape in that manner if you do
that's<00:02:07.640> what<00:02:07.760> I'm<00:02:07.970> talking<00:02:08.390> about

00:02:08.620 --> 00:02:08.630 
that's what I'm talking about

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:11.080 
that's what I'm talking about
okay<00:02:09.080> so<00:02:09.560> we're<00:02:09.680> driving<00:02:10.070> the<00:02:10.190> lick<00:02:10.429> from<00:02:10.790> that

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:11.090 
okay so we're driving the lick from that

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:13.120 
okay so we're driving the lick from that
now<00:02:11.750> let<00:02:11.930> me<00:02:11.990> show<00:02:12.230> you<00:02:12.290> the<00:02:12.560> lick<00:02:12.770> and<00:02:13.100> then

now let me show you the lick and then

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:14.650 
now let me show you the lick and then
I'll<00:02:13.370> go<00:02:13.550> through<00:02:13.580> it<00:02:13.970> with<00:02:14.030> you<00:02:14.330> so<00:02:14.600> you

the lick and you can come back here and
you<00:02:26.840> can<00:02:26.990> actually<00:02:27.140> go<00:02:27.410> lower<00:02:27.710> in<00:02:27.920> the<00:02:28.070> scale

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:28.310 
you can actually go lower in the scale

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:33.740

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:46.190 
our opening example I mixed up all of

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:47.710 
our opening example I mixed up all of
the<00:03:46.280> double<00:03:46.580> stops<00:03:46.849> and<00:03:47.030> you<00:03:47.090> heard<00:03:47.270> that<00:03:47.420> lick

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:50.420 
in there in seven times that's going to

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:52.150 
in there in seven times that's going to
work<00:03:50.599> beautifully<00:03:50.989> over<00:03:51.590> our<00:03:51.860> G<00:03:52.130> chord

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:52.160 
work beautifully over our G chord

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:54.430

obviously<00:03:53.060> we've<00:03:53.390> shown<00:03:53.660> you<00:03:53.690> the<00:03:53.840> tones<00:03:54.230> of

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:54.440 
obviously we've shown you the tones of

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:56.380 
obviously we've shown you the tones of
the<00:03:54.560> G<00:03:54.830> and<00:03:55.040> if<00:03:55.640> you<00:03:55.730> actually<00:03:55.880> play

the G and if you actually play

00:03:56.390 --> 00:03:59.500 
the G and if you actually play
inversions<00:03:57.290> of<00:03:57.470> a<00:03:57.560> G<00:03:57.800> you<00:03:58.670> can<00:03:58.700> see<00:03:59.180> them<00:03:59.390> on

00:03:59.500 --> 00:03:59.510 
inversions of a G you can see them on

00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:01.030 
inversions of a G you can see them on
the<00:03:59.630> fret<00:03:59.840> board<00:03:59.870> here<00:04:00.260> and<00:04:00.349> some<00:04:00.620> of<00:04:00.709> you<00:04:00.860> may

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:09.940 
know this arpeggio inversion shape I'm
just<00:04:04.040> going<00:04:04.160> to<00:04:04.220> show<00:04:04.430> you<00:04:04.489> that<00:04:08.769> so<00:04:09.769> you<00:04:09.830> would

have G G with the B base G back with the
G<00:04:15.830> base<00:04:16.100> and<00:04:16.940> then<00:04:17.359> G<00:04:17.660> with<00:04:17.840> the<00:04:17.900> D<00:04:18.049> base<00:04:18.290> so<00:04:18.620> you

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:18.950 
G base and then G with the D base so you

00:04:18.950 --> 00:04:20.379 
G base and then G with the D base so you
can<00:04:19.130> almost<00:04:19.250> look<00:04:19.609> at<00:04:19.760> it<00:04:19.850> as<00:04:19.970> being<00:04:20.000> nor

00:04:20.379 --> 00:04:20.389 
can almost look at it as being nor

00:04:20.389 --> 00:04:24.159 
can almost look at it as being nor
arpeggio<00:04:20.989> two<00:04:21.109> for<00:04:21.709> that<00:04:21.829> chord<00:04:22.250> okay<00:04:23.169> anyway
