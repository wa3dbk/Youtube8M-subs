00:00:07.099 --> 00:00:12.330
 so welcome back and wanted to completely 

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:14.099
 in short, two small topics that I like 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:16.350
 wants to cut and that is the first one 

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:18.029
 it's about strength training and that 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:19.439
 weight what you used when training 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:21.000
 I noticed a bit of that 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:23.939
 Last time in the studio where I train 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:26.490
 that many, especially at beginners 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:29.400
 At least that's what I think 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:32.009
 that the beginners are that easy 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:33.750
 such a little ego problem or one 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:36.750
 little ego with services in the 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:40.739
 power room bring what is called okay me 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:42.600
 I am somehow encouraged now 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:44.160
 a little more weight to press yes and 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:46.079
 I can not benchmark with ten then 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:47.640
 kilo per side or five kilos 

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:49.980
 silver even less because I do not 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:51.989
 have the strength and then there will 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:53.489
 somehow pressed and hungry help 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:54.930
 also the friends with and whatever 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:58.969
 and then you will shit yourself 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:01:01.079
 especially those who think 

00:00:58.969 --> 00:01:03.510
 bodybuilding areas it was the 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:04.769
 tell me it's about beautiful body 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:07.950
 to have as he approx 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:09.780
 The weight does not matter much 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:11.250
 will you become one way or the other with time? 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:13.229
 if you do not say I want to go in now 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:15.720
 then go this powerlifting area 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:17.909
 the weight is only the means to the purpose 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:20.820
 and the muscles that appeal to her 

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:22.409
 if they wanted to grow they had to grow like that 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:24.330
 be trained or already 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:26.520
 get that they are growing and already 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:28.860
 does not mean as much power as possible 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:30.420
 but as much weight as possible then in 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:31.829
 the corresponding repetition area 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:34.560
 where we work and where you are 

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:38.100
 you should work clean yourself 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:41.119
 work and muscle as good as it 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:43.470
 goes to the maximum range of motion 

00:01:41.119 --> 00:01:44.700
 train yes that means so if I 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:46.890
 a weight had what she did not clean 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:48.869
 have to deal with half a part 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:51.149
 I can not do repetition then 

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:51.860
 optimally irritate the muscle or optimally 

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:54.960
 work out 

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:57.299
 therefore the weight is the means to 

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:58.500
 purpose and also as a small set 

00:01:57.299 --> 00:02:00.000
 yes remember 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:02.490
 it's not about how much weight 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.740
 pushes it comes to look as 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:06.210
 as if your plane pushes me so yes 

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:09.030
 little bit of a small sentence force the 

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:10.440
 weights come with time so makes 

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:11.700
 there will be no worries 

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:13.620
 someday 

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:15.810
 raise or bend or press or 

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:17.730
 whatever over 100 animals or what 

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:19.650
 you always want to have her look there 

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:22.440
 nobody was interested in none 

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:24.480
 really except maybe the people the 

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:25.890
 to profile yourself a bit 

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:27.930
 because maybe she's worse than you 

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:30.569
 look and then look easy 

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:31.769
 time flaunt wallace flash 10 kilos 

00:02:30.569 --> 00:02:32.730
 press more on the bench and maybe 

00:02:31.769 --> 00:02:35.849
 the double 

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:37.680
 but it is also sometimes the thinking 

00:02:35.849 --> 00:02:39.569
 yes yes there is a risk of injury 

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:42.180
 always there and you know is if you look 

00:02:39.569 --> 00:02:44.250
 hurt yes because you have to set synonymous 

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:46.200
 if it's only five days or a week 

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:49.200
 annoying there must be but a bit 

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:51.120
 back and just corrosive when going for 

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:52.680
 things that are nonsensical unimportant e 

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:53.940
 are not any little ones too 

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:56.310
 works also small injuries or 

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:59.160
 even a big injury or with 

00:02:56.310 --> 00:03:00.450
 the time is causing major injuries because 

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:03.180
 some injuries come first 

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:04.410
 after years and indeed already clear to me 

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:07.650
 many of you do not think so far because 

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:09.239
 they say after ten years but believe 

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:11.459
 me when it is time then it is 

00:03:09.239 --> 00:03:13.319
 the big awesome okay it was the one 

00:03:11.459 --> 00:03:15.780
 The other thing is not 

00:03:13.319 --> 00:03:17.250
 bit the subject supplements and yes 

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:18.540
 actually noticed i have that one 

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:21.620
 bit avoided so far in the 

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:24.540
 videos then great to respond 

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:27.269
 or to tell what I use like me 

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:29.010
 That's because I'm not 

00:03:27.269 --> 00:03:30.630
 used supplements or or because of me 

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:33.930
 an opponent of it is completely the opposite 

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:37.290
 So I use some of it I give 

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:40.079
 also every month to the 100 euro from each 

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:41.310
 after what i need of course for 

00:03:40.079 --> 00:03:42.200
 satellite I have been doing it since 

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:45.030
 years 

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:46.290
 I am also of their effect of 

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:48.840
 The things I use too 

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:50.670
 Surely convinced also here and 

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:52.620
 I admit to being a bit of a placebo 

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:54.930
 or just to my head, but 

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:56.519
 effect but as I said bothers me 

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:58.410
 My thing is also for me 

00:03:56.519 --> 00:03:59.730
 me and I'm not interested 

00:03:58.410 --> 00:04:01.170
 what the others say or how it is 

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:01.489
 have another hand and so on and so on 

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:05.010
 on 

00:04:01.489 --> 00:04:06.359
 The problem is that's why I have it 

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:09.209
 times bit like a lie on the edge 

00:04:06.359 --> 00:04:11.519
 At the moment I know most of them 

00:04:09.209 --> 00:04:14.069
 you guys are watching the videos and 

00:04:11.519 --> 00:04:15.620
 I made the mistake at the beginning 

00:04:14.069 --> 00:04:18.060
 when I started to exercise 

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:21.060
 waste more time with me too 

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:23.550
 superior ok which powder must have 

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:25.169
 I'll get it now because it's not anymore 

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:26.520
 goes on because probably no muscles 

00:04:25.169 --> 00:04:27.960
 adult or whatever to 

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:29.490
 to train more successfully 

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:31.229
 and that has become a big mistake yes 

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:33.990
 So that means at the beginning yes 

00:04:31.229 --> 00:04:36.150
 nonsensical money a lot of money for things off 

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:37.620
 or put the focus on things the 

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:39.060
 actually no role plays 

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:40.500
 we are wise where the problem is not 

00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:43.169
 really is it's not the 

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:46.289
 recommend missing whey protein ears 

00:04:43.169 --> 00:04:49.409
 to bcaa amino acids or creative that 

00:04:46.289 --> 00:04:51.270
 you do not need any muscles now yes needs 

00:04:49.409 --> 00:04:52.650
 otherwise polemik somewhere else if you 

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:54.360
 to deal with the other things 

00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:56.280
 as for example with the diet 

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:57.810
 then just bring this supplements in 

00:04:56.280 --> 00:04:59.849
 nothing but wasting money then can 

00:04:57.810 --> 00:05:02.129
 The money also throw the same 

00:04:59.849 --> 00:05:05.539
 or sent me just and then 

00:05:02.129 --> 00:05:08.430
 I have more of that 

00:05:05.539 --> 00:05:10.020
 So as I said I have it 

00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:11.699
 i use the stuff i can too 

00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:12.590
 to say something good was bad 

00:05:11.699 --> 00:05:14.490
 and so on 

00:05:12.590 --> 00:05:16.740
 but I hold myself a bit too 

00:05:14.490 --> 00:05:18.990
 back what that concerns because as I said 

00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:21.060
 you have to understand that nutrition that 

00:05:18.990 --> 00:05:23.129
 most important is yes and supplements are 

00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:24.840
 nice and good but they are only for 

00:05:23.129 --> 00:05:25.949
 Optimization there and I can not do something 

00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:31.529
 optimize 

00:05:25.949 --> 00:05:32.580
 if i agree otherwise that's okay 

00:05:31.529 --> 00:05:34.800
 It was a bit to my opinion 

00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:39.949
 that was on this topic and I think so 

00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:39.949
 that was it until the next one
