00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:49.310 
flowers onto the headband not the actual

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:51.340 
flowers onto the headband not the actual
styrofoam<00:00:50.000> so<00:00:50.300> there<00:00:50.570> you<00:00:50.690> have<00:00:50.720> your<00:00:50.840> flower

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:55.180 
styrofoam so there you have your flower

what<00:02:19.370> works<00:02:19.610> best<00:02:19.970> and<00:02:20.180> just<00:02:20.810> go<00:02:20.930> ahead<00:02:21.020> and

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:21.140 
what works best and just go ahead and

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:23.800 
what works best and just go ahead and
hold<00:02:21.620> it<00:02:21.980> and<00:02:22.220> then<00:02:22.310> you're<00:02:23.060> going<00:02:23.180> to<00:02:23.240> go<00:02:23.569> on

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:23.810 
hold it and then you're going to go on

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:25.840 
hold it and then you're going to go on
the<00:02:23.960> styrofoam<00:02:24.560> put<00:02:24.980> some<00:02:25.190> hot<00:02:25.370> glue<00:02:25.520> on<00:02:25.819> it

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:25.850 
the styrofoam put some hot glue on it

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:27.940 
the styrofoam put some hot glue on it
and<00:02:26.210> get<00:02:26.660> your<00:02:26.870> little<00:02:26.990> leaves<00:02:27.350> two<00:02:27.710> at<00:02:27.830> a<00:02:27.860> time

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:27.950 
and get your little leaves two at a time

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:30.640 
and get your little leaves two at a time
and<00:02:28.460> put<00:02:29.240> them<00:02:29.420> down<00:02:29.660> and<00:02:30.050> then<00:02:30.500> make<00:02:30.620> sure

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:30.650 
and put them down and then make sure

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:32.590 
and put them down and then make sure
you're<00:02:30.950> tapping<00:02:31.340> tapping<00:02:31.550> tapping<00:02:31.910> so<00:02:32.450> they

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:32.600 
you're tapping tapping tapping so they

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:37.120 
you're tapping tapping tapping so they
could<00:02:32.840> stay<00:02:33.290> on<00:02:33.319> there<00:02:35.620> so<00:02:36.620> just<00:02:36.860> make<00:02:37.100> sure

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:37.130 
could stay on there so just make sure

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:38.830 
could stay on there so just make sure
that<00:02:37.310> you<00:02:37.670> leave<00:02:37.910> the<00:02:38.150> top<00:02:38.330> of<00:02:38.510> the<00:02:38.660> leaf

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:38.840 
that you leave the top of the leaf

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:41.140 
that you leave the top of the leaf
unglued<00:02:39.530> that<00:02:39.980> way<00:02:40.130> when<00:02:40.310> you<00:02:40.430> act<00:02:40.670> the<00:02:40.910> other

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:41.150 
unglued that way when you act the other

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:43.900 
unglued that way when you act the other
one<00:02:41.510> you<00:02:42.410> know<00:02:42.560> the<00:02:42.860> bottom<00:02:43.160> will<00:02:43.340> be<00:02:43.460> covered

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:43.910 
one you know the bottom will be covered

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:44.860 
one you know the bottom will be covered
and

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:44.870 
and

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:47.680 
and
nice<00:02:45.379> and<00:02:45.739> uniform<00:02:45.920> and<00:02:46.519> also<00:02:47.269> it<00:02:47.420> gives<00:02:47.540> it

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:47.690 
nice and uniform and also it gives it

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:50.350 
nice and uniform and also it gives it
some<00:02:47.930> like<00:02:48.110> texture<00:02:48.769> to<00:02:48.980> the<00:02:49.370> project<00:02:49.970> because

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:50.360 
some like texture to the project because

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:52.390 
some like texture to the project because
you<00:02:50.540> know<00:02:50.629> it's<00:02:50.900> not<00:02:51.110> all<00:02:51.319> glued<00:02:52.040> in<00:02:52.190> one

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:52.400 
you know it's not all glued in one

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:54.089 
you know it's not all glued in one
straight<00:02:52.730> line<00:02:52.760> they're<00:02:53.180> kind<00:02:53.360> of<00:02:53.450> like<00:02:53.599> flowy

00:02:54.089 --> 00:02:54.099 
straight line they're kind of like flowy

00:02:54.099 --> 00:02:56.410 
straight line they're kind of like flowy
actually<00:02:55.099> messed<00:02:55.310> up<00:02:55.549> so<00:02:55.700> I'm<00:02:55.760> pulling<00:02:56.090> it<00:02:56.180> up

00:02:56.410 --> 00:02:56.420 
actually messed up so I'm pulling it up

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:58.839 
actually messed up so I'm pulling it up
before<00:02:56.690> the<00:02:56.989> glue<00:02:57.230> dry<00:02:57.560> so<00:02:57.920> the<00:02:58.099> top<00:02:58.549> of<00:02:58.730> the

00:02:58.839 --> 00:02:58.849 
before the glue dry so the top of the

00:02:58.849 --> 00:03:00.670 
before the glue dry so the top of the
leaf<00:02:59.030> could<00:02:59.299> cover<00:02:59.510> the<00:02:59.690> bottom<00:02:59.870> of<00:03:00.110> that<00:03:00.379> one

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:00.680 
leaf could cover the bottom of that one

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:04.030 
leaf could cover the bottom of that one
and<00:03:01.010> then<00:03:01.970> once<00:03:02.239> that<00:03:02.390> is<00:03:02.900> nice<00:03:03.230> and<00:03:03.470> in<00:03:03.620> place

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:04.040 
and then once that is nice and in place

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:08.110 
and then once that is nice and in place
I<00:03:05.709> so<00:03:06.709> once<00:03:06.920> that<00:03:07.010> one<00:03:07.250> is<00:03:07.370> in<00:03:07.549> place<00:03:07.700> I<00:03:07.849> start

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:08.120 
I so once that one is in place I start

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:09.759 
I so once that one is in place I start
to<00:03:08.269> add<00:03:08.420> it<00:03:08.599> on<00:03:08.720> the<00:03:08.870> other<00:03:09.110> side<00:03:09.440> because<00:03:09.590> I

00:03:09.759 --> 00:03:09.769 
to add it on the other side because I

00:03:09.769 --> 00:03:11.199 
to add it on the other side because I
want<00:03:09.950> to<00:03:10.010> meet<00:03:10.220> in<00:03:10.400> the<00:03:10.549> middle<00:03:10.670> I<00:03:10.819> just<00:03:11.030> don't

00:03:11.199 --> 00:03:11.209 
want to meet in the middle I just don't

00:03:11.209 --> 00:03:13.420 
want to meet in the middle I just don't
want<00:03:11.329> to<00:03:11.390> go<00:03:11.510> in<00:03:11.629> all<00:03:11.840> the<00:03:11.870> one<00:03:12.200> way<00:03:12.409> so<00:03:13.099> same

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:13.430 
want to go in all the one way so same

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:16.330 
want to go in all the one way so same
thing<00:03:13.459> I<00:03:13.879> make<00:03:13.940> sure<00:03:14.329> the<00:03:14.510> top<00:03:14.720> isn't<00:03:15.340> glued

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:16.340 
thing I make sure the top isn't glued

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:18.550 
thing I make sure the top isn't glued
and<00:03:16.760> then<00:03:16.910> I<00:03:17.030> add<00:03:17.239> my<00:03:17.269> other<00:03:17.569> leave<00:03:18.200> also

00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:18.560 
and then I add my other leave also

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:20.289 
and then I add my other leave also
making<00:03:18.829> sure<00:03:19.099> that<00:03:19.280> one's<00:03:19.489> not<00:03:19.700> glued<00:03:20.060> and

making sure that one's not glued and
then<00:03:20.870> I<00:03:21.079> cover<00:03:21.650> the<00:03:21.859> bottom<00:03:22.040> up<00:03:22.430> and<00:03:22.730> it<00:03:23.420> looks

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:23.540 
then I cover the bottom up and it looks

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:27.430 
then I cover the bottom up and it looks
nice<00:03:24.109> and<00:03:24.859> so<00:03:25.579> tappy<00:03:26.000> tappy<00:03:26.209> tappy<00:03:26.450> and<00:03:26.870> now<00:03:27.410> I

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:31.400 
with the last two that go in the center

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:34.390 
with the last two that go in the center
is<00:03:31.430> you<00:03:31.879> want<00:03:32.060> to<00:03:32.150> have<00:03:32.359> one<00:03:32.680> facing<00:03:33.680> down<00:03:34.040> and

the other one you want to have it facing
up<00:03:37.489> that<00:03:38.150> way<00:03:38.359> all<00:03:39.230> the<00:03:39.530> styrofoam<00:03:39.950> will<00:03:40.040> get

00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:40.310 
up that way all the styrofoam will get

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:42.970 
up that way all the styrofoam will get
covered<00:03:40.790> and<00:03:41.030> you<00:03:41.480> won't<00:03:41.629> have<00:03:41.810> it<00:03:42.109> like<00:03:42.440> weird

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:42.980 
covered and you won't have it like weird

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:44.410 
covered and you won't have it like weird
looking<00:03:43.310> gaps<00:03:43.549> and<00:03:43.790> it<00:03:43.849> actually<00:03:44.000> looks

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:44.420 
looking gaps and it actually looks

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:47.410 
looking gaps and it actually looks

00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:47.420 
really nice so now we just have the back

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:50.049 
really nice so now we just have the back
side<00:03:47.629> and<00:03:47.659> we're<00:03:47.900> done
