00:00:01.190 --> 00:00:06.000
 I am mario persona and these are the 

00:00:03.959 --> 00:00:09.450
 answers that hate that they asked me 

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:11.400
 about the Bible you asked if I did not 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:13.920
 Would it be possible for you to live alone? 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:15.690
 learning only the Bible is the idea of 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:18.240
 that we just need the bible of 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:20.820
 nothing and nobody to be modified in 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:22.340
 faith can only be spiritual but it is not 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:24.600
 correct is not a biblical idea 

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:27.449
 evidently the word of God to 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:29.699
 useful for teaching to 

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:31.230
 to correct to instruct justice 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:33.600
 but was it so that God 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:36.090
 determined that we needed only 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:38.489
 from the word of God nothing more 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:40.770
 well we pay attention at all times 

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:42.420
 text where I just took this part 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:44.789
 that the word of God is profitable 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:46.920
 to teach to help guide to 

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:49.260
 to correct for this is injustice 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:52.500
 if we take the context all of us 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:55.590
 we will have something more safety and motorcycle 1417 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:58.710
 But you remain in what you learn. 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:01:02.160
 he said he was acquainted knowing 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:04.229
 who has learned it and that since 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:06.930
 two girls know if the sacred 

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:08.909
 scriptures that can do what they know 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:09.960
 for salvation by the faith which is in Christ 

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:11.970
 Jesus 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:13.950
 all the outlaw inspired writing 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:16.439
 and useful for teaching to 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:18.450
 to correct for this is injustice to 

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:21.630
 May the man of God be perfect and 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:24.540
 perfectly set up for every work 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:26.939
 that timóteo had learned the 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:29.820
 sacred scriptures since childhood. 

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:32.220
 mother eunice and her grandmother league two 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:34.829
 women who have fulfilled their role 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:37.170
 teach the word or write in the 

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:38.460
 Old Testament testament at that time to 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:41.189
 little timothy 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:42.780
 therefore god used people to teach 

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:45.689
 the scriptures to timóteo 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:48.869
 we went acts 8 and we will find a 

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:51.180
 man reading isaiah in his carriage him 

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:53.070
 has he got the old testament that he 

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:54.000
 had he isaiah he is reading 

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:56.610
 isaiah 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:58.500
 but we see that filipe guiado by 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:02.240
 holy spirit is to get you to find 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:04.700
 that traveler and ask them 

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:06.140
 I understood what I was reading in 1830 

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:08.330
 understands this the killers 

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:09.830
 he said how could he understand if 

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:11.930
 someone does not teach me 

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:13.040
 that man had the scriptures he 

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:14.300
 had the scriptures 

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:16.430
 You could talk like this but I had 

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:18.050
 written then had everything but it depends 

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:20.959
 of someone to teach 

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:23.780
 Felipe is the evangelist who does this and the 

00:02:20.959 --> 00:02:25.400
 man converts to christ in acts 11 

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:27.650
 we find others preaching the 

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:29.420
 gospel of antioch and seeing the 

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:30.200
 results in the conversion of many 

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:32.150
 people 

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:34.970
 those who convert become then 

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:37.400
 helped by barnabé that encourages them to 

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:39.200
 remain in the Lord and then send 

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:39.860
 see paulo to help in teaching the 

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:41.959
 word 

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:45.019
 all this is in harmony with what 

00:02:41.959 --> 00:02:47.959
 teach and Ephesians 4 verses 8 to 14 

00:02:45.019 --> 00:02:50.810
 so it says rose to the high evocative 

00:02:47.959 --> 00:02:53.330
 captivity and weldon salt the men and he 

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:55.519
 even christ from some to posts and others 

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:57.769
 prophets and others for evangelist c 

00:02:55.519 --> 00:02:59.690
 others to pastors who, besides 

00:02:57.769 --> 00:03:01.700
 the perfecting of the saints for the 

00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:04.430
 the work of the ministry for the 

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:06.980
 body of Christ until we all come to 

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:10.010
 unity of faith and the knowledge of the child 

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:12.590
 of God to the perfect man and the 

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:14.630
 full height of christ 

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:17.959
 God's wish was not that people 

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:20.380
 had only access to his word but 

00:03:17.959 --> 00:03:23.840
 he arranged for people to be 

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:25.880
 empowered with gifts after the prophets 

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:28.280
 evangelist pastors or 

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:31.340
 doctors to preach and teach this 

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:33.049
 same word to other people so that 

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:34.819
 there was the identification of the body of 

00:03:33.049 --> 00:03:37.459
 Christ therefore you can not 

00:03:34.819 --> 00:03:39.980
 simply dismiss those who 

00:03:37.459 --> 00:03:43.190
 Christ did not regard them as superfluous and 

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:45.410
 to speak like that does not have the bible enough 

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:47.630
 no you can not do this so 

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:49.579
 Do you need the word of God anymore? 

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:52.160
 in the way God has established all 

00:03:49.579 --> 00:03:53.060
 things and you will also need the 

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:55.660
 gifts 

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:57.799
 maybe that same word understand it 

00:03:55.660 --> 00:04:00.049
 understanding if you are on an island 

00:03:57.799 --> 00:04:01.850
 deserted with only a Bible in the hands 

00:04:00.049 --> 00:04:03.739
 holy spirit will do what it takes to 

00:04:01.850 --> 00:04:06.260
 you know what he wants you to 

00:04:03.739 --> 00:04:08.150
 know but under normal conditions this is 

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:10.819
 What is the word employed? 

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:12.439
 signed by men with their own 

00:04:10.819 --> 00:04:14.450
 Jesus to do it 

00:04:12.439 --> 00:04:16.579
 today we have no more apostles and 

00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:19.070
 prophets as they existed at the beginning of 

00:04:16.579 --> 00:04:21.380
 church to bequeath to us in the foundations 

00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:23.690
 and doctrines but we already have the volume 

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:26.020
 the revelation of God and the gifts 

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:28.850
 evangelist master pastor or doctor 

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:31.220
 continue through which those who are 

00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:34.570
 make your word that is already there today 

00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:38.120
 writing reach our mind and heart 

00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:40.639
 says their source for the organized is 

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:41.810
 listening live or in recordings of the 

00:04:40.639 --> 00:04:43.490
 first enrolled 

00:04:41.810 --> 00:04:46.400
 obviously the standard by which 

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:48.800
 to judge all things remains the 

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:51.050
 Word of God scriptures and you 

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:52.940
 should therefore judge everything the 

00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:55.840
 people teach and even what I say here 

00:04:52.940 --> 00:04:58.160
 so you will not be fooled by after 

00:04:55.840 --> 00:05:00.169
 fraudsters or heretics in search of 

00:04:58.160 --> 00:05:02.750
 disciples but do not fall into the error of 

00:05:00.169 --> 00:05:06.259
 think you do not need people who 

00:05:02.750 --> 00:05:08.270
 he take the gospel teaching case 

00:05:06.259 --> 00:05:10.580
 not be converted who teach the 

00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:12.470
 doctrine of bets already in case 

00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:14.120
 converted because you think that already 

00:05:12.470 --> 00:05:16.580
 I already have the bible all I 

00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:19.639
 I need to think that you can dispense 

00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:21.860
 the gifts that Christ gave to the church in 

00:05:19.639 --> 00:05:23.720
 keeping the Bible alone can only 

00:05:21.860 --> 00:05:28.220
 very spiritual attitude on your part but 

00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:30.199
 biblically wrong egocentric no 

00:05:28.220 --> 00:05:31.849
 of us is self sufficient in things of 

00:05:30.199 --> 00:05:34.340
 God we need each other to 

00:05:31.849 --> 00:05:37.580
 learn the first with this 12 of 20 and 

00:05:34.340 --> 00:05:40.220
 21 to 31 says that so color as there is 

00:05:37.580 --> 00:05:42.530
 many members plus one body and one eye 

00:05:40.220 --> 00:05:44.990
 can not say the hand has no need 

00:05:42.530 --> 00:05:47.960
 not even head to toes do not have 

00:05:44.990 --> 00:05:50.900
 need for voice, but you the scope of 

00:05:47.960 --> 00:05:53.840
 Christ and its members in particular and 

00:05:50.900 --> 00:05:56.150
 we gave god in the church first 

00:05:53.840 --> 00:05:58.580
 second place prophets in 

00:05:56.150 --> 00:06:01.370
 third place doctors after miracles 

00:05:58.580 --> 00:06:03.979
 then a gift of healing only with governments 

00:06:01.370 --> 00:06:06.020
 variety cinemas by chance are all 

00:06:03.979 --> 00:06:07.639
 the posts are all prophets are all 

00:06:06.020 --> 00:06:10.220
 doctors are all operators 

00:06:07.639 --> 00:06:12.720
 miracles have all the gift of healing speak 

00:06:10.220 --> 00:06:15.340
 all different languages interpret tone 

00:06:12.720 --> 00:06:17.379
 therefore look with zeal for the best 

00:06:15.340 --> 00:06:18.210
 I'm going to show a path of the most 

00:06:17.379 --> 00:06:20.710
 great 

00:06:18.210 --> 00:06:24.819
 see that in addition to gifts posted on 

00:06:20.710 --> 00:06:28.150
 Ephesians there are others or manifestations 

00:06:24.819 --> 00:06:30.729
 of a more practical nature for 

00:06:28.150 --> 00:06:32.830
 the issues of day-to-day and before 

00:06:30.729 --> 00:06:34.719
 you ask how to look with the errors 

00:06:32.830 --> 00:06:37.090
 better understand that paulo is not 

00:06:34.719 --> 00:06:38.770
 writing individuals but extending 

00:06:37.090 --> 00:06:41.259
 an unconfirmed church assembly in the 

00:06:38.770 --> 00:06:42.460
 search for the best 12 for 

00:06:41.259 --> 00:06:44.229
 receive the 

00:06:42.460 --> 00:06:46.780
 ah I want this gift I want it I want 

00:06:44.229 --> 00:06:49.389
 that's not it but the assembly 

00:06:46.780 --> 00:06:52.449
 identify your means good best 

00:06:49.389 --> 00:06:54.969
 to collectively enjoy the 

00:06:52.449 --> 00:06:57.460
 good ones and my gifts are those 

00:06:54.969 --> 00:07:00.009
 that they get all the assembly and are 

00:06:57.460 --> 00:07:02.440
 exercised in love and not to vanity 

00:07:00.009 --> 00:07:04.659
 self-salvation see that he continued 

00:07:02.440 --> 00:07:07.659
 the subject in chapter 14 principle 

00:07:04.659 --> 00:07:09.969
 london corinthians follow love and 

00:07:07.659 --> 00:07:11.949
 to look for spiritual gifts or 

00:07:09.969 --> 00:07:14.259
 spiritual manifestations but 

00:07:11.949 --> 00:07:15.550
 mainly of prophesying teacher and 

00:07:14.259 --> 00:07:18.159
 here the coastal sense 

00:07:15.550 --> 00:07:21.430
 would be the word or be transmitting be 

00:07:18.159 --> 00:07:23.590
 Word spokesman because talking to 

00:07:21.430 --> 00:07:25.900
 Unknown language does not speak to men 

00:07:23.590 --> 00:07:27.969
 if not God because no one understands 

00:07:25.900 --> 00:07:31.830
 and spirit speaks mysteries 

00:07:27.969 --> 00:07:35.440
 maso who prophesies to speak men to 

00:07:31.830 --> 00:07:37.330
 edification of the 

00:07:35.440 --> 00:07:40.719
 who speaks the unfamiliar language effective in 

00:07:37.330 --> 00:07:43.449
 himself but what he prophesies he 

00:07:40.719 --> 00:07:46.719
 church there you 've already seen 

00:07:43.449 --> 00:07:51.360
 I can already see what gifts I have 

00:07:46.719 --> 00:07:51.360
 I bet I considered better gifts
