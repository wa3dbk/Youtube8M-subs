review for you today on a protein

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:16.220 
review for you today on a protein
product<00:00:14.160> made<00:00:14.340> by<00:00:14.370> BSN<00:00:15.090> this<00:00:15.840> is<00:00:16.020> called

00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:16.230 
product made by BSN this is called

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:19.099 
product made by BSN this is called
syntha-6<00:00:16.910> isolate<00:00:17.910> now<00:00:18.480> for<00:00:18.690> some<00:00:18.810> of<00:00:18.869> you<00:00:18.960> out

00:00:19.099 --> 00:00:19.109 
syntha-6 isolate now for some of you out

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:20.750 
syntha-6 isolate now for some of you out
there<00:00:19.140> that<00:00:19.560> are<00:00:19.770> familiar<00:00:20.010> with<00:00:20.520> the<00:00:20.730> old

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:20.760 
there that are familiar with the old

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:23.599 
there that are familiar with the old
syntha-6<00:00:21.449> this<00:00:22.050> is<00:00:22.199> a<00:00:22.230> little<00:00:22.859> bit<00:00:23.039> different

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:23.609 
syntha-6 this is a little bit different

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:26.029 
syntha-6 this is a little bit different
whereas<00:00:24.419> the<00:00:24.539> old<00:00:24.720> sent<00:00:25.019> to<00:00:25.169> six<00:00:25.439> got<00:00:25.740> its<00:00:25.890> name

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:26.039 
whereas the old sent to six got its name

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:27.710 
whereas the old sent to six got its name
from<00:00:26.099> having<00:00:26.550> six<00:00:26.939> different<00:00:27.150> types<00:00:27.509> of

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:27.720 
from having six different types of

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:28.609 
from having six different types of
protein<00:00:28.169> in<00:00:28.320> it

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:28.619 
protein in it

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:31.370 
protein in it
this<00:00:29.130> syntha-6<00:00:29.640> isolate<00:00:30.390> really<00:00:30.810> only<00:00:31.140> has

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:31.380 
this syntha-6 isolate really only has

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:34.220 
this syntha-6 isolate really only has
two<00:00:31.859> its<00:00:32.220> whey<00:00:32.730> protein<00:00:33.239> isolate<00:00:33.750> and<00:00:33.900> milk

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:34.230 
two its whey protein isolate and milk

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:35.420 
two its whey protein isolate and milk
protein<00:00:34.739> isolate

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:35.430 
protein isolate

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:37.729 
protein isolate
now<00:00:35.910> the<00:00:35.970> whey<00:00:36.180> protein<00:00:36.630> isolate<00:00:37.230> contains

00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:37.739 
now the whey protein isolate contains

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:40.790 
now the whey protein isolate contains
zero<00:00:38.640> lactose<00:00:39.270> it's<00:00:39.809> also<00:00:39.989> been<00:00:40.260> filtered<00:00:40.680> to

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800 
zero lactose it's also been filtered to

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:42.650 
zero lactose it's also been filtered to
remove<00:00:40.829> the<00:00:41.190> fats<00:00:41.430> from<00:00:41.670> it<00:00:41.910> and<00:00:42.059> it's<00:00:42.180> 90

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:42.660 
remove the fats from it and it's 90

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:44.810 
remove the fats from it and it's 90
percent<00:00:42.690> protein<00:00:43.350> by<00:00:43.770> weight<00:00:43.800> it's<00:00:44.520> one<00:00:44.730> of

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:44.820 
percent protein by weight it's one of

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:47.000 
percent protein by weight it's one of
the<00:00:44.879> best<00:00:45.239> types<00:00:45.539> of<00:00:45.750> whey<00:00:45.930> protein<00:00:45.960> out<00:00:46.680> there

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
the best types of whey protein out there

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:49.040 
the best types of whey protein out there
and<00:00:47.250> then<00:00:47.730> the<00:00:47.850> milk<00:00:48.059> protein<00:00:48.269> isolate<00:00:48.960> is

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.050 
and then the milk protein isolate is

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:51.889 
and then the milk protein isolate is
about<00:00:49.260> 80%<00:00:49.559> casing<00:00:50.460> as<00:00:50.699> well<00:00:51.030> as<00:00:51.329> 20<00:00:51.690> percent

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:51.899 
about 80% casing as well as 20 percent

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:53.299 
about 80% casing as well as 20 percent
whey<00:00:52.379> protein<00:00:52.859> so<00:00:52.949> there's<00:00:53.070> gonna<00:00:53.160> be<00:00:53.250> a

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
whey protein so there's gonna be a

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:56.509 
whey protein so there's gonna be a
little<00:00:53.730> bit<00:00:53.850> of<00:00:53.940> lactose<00:00:54.420> in<00:00:54.660> it<00:00:55.039> probably<00:00:56.039> not

00:00:56.509 --> 00:00:56.519 
little bit of lactose in it probably not

00:00:56.519 --> 00:00:58.459 
little bit of lactose in it probably not
enough<00:00:56.940> to<00:00:57.179> upset<00:00:57.539> anybody<00:00:57.750> stomach<00:00:58.260> unless

00:00:58.459 --> 00:00:58.469 
enough to upset anybody stomach unless

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:00.979 
enough to upset anybody stomach unless
you're<00:00:58.649> severely<00:00:59.010> sensitive<00:00:59.550> to<00:00:59.640> lactose<00:01:00.059> now

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989 
you're severely sensitive to lactose now

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:02.990 
you're severely sensitive to lactose now
they've<00:01:01.140> also<00:01:01.350> added<00:01:01.800> a<00:01:01.890> poly<00:01:02.160> dextrose<00:01:02.699> fiber

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
they've also added a poly dextrose fiber

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:04.430 
they've also added a poly dextrose fiber
in<00:01:03.239> here<00:01:03.420> which<00:01:03.600> is<00:01:03.780> going<00:01:03.870> to<00:01:03.929> make<00:01:04.140> it<00:01:04.260> a<00:01:04.320> lot

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:04.440 
in here which is going to make it a lot

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:06.170 
in here which is going to make it a lot
more<00:01:04.589> filling<00:01:05.100> it's<00:01:05.580> gonna<00:01:05.670> give<00:01:05.850> it<00:01:05.940> a<00:01:06.000> lot

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
more filling it's gonna give it a lot

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:07.520 
more filling it's gonna give it a lot
better<00:01:06.360> texture<00:01:06.930> more<00:01:07.080> of<00:01:07.200> that<00:01:07.350> like

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
better texture more of that like

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:10.539 
better texture more of that like
milkshake<00:01:08.190> texture<00:01:08.850> as<00:01:09.750> far<00:01:10.050> as<00:01:10.230> the<00:01:10.440> the

00:01:10.539 --> 00:01:10.549 
milkshake texture as far as the the

00:01:10.549 --> 00:01:12.260 
milkshake texture as far as the the
calories<00:01:11.549> going<00:01:11.790> in

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
calories going in

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:16.609 
calories going in
it's<00:01:12.420> only<00:01:12.509> a<00:01:13.549> 142<00:01:14.549> grams<00:01:14.850> of<00:01:15.240> fat<00:01:15.500> compared<00:01:16.500> to

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
it's only a 142 grams of fat compared to

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:19.190 
it's only a 142 grams of fat compared to
6<00:01:16.950> grams<00:01:17.220> in<00:01:17.490> the<00:01:17.579> original<00:01:18.060> sent<00:01:18.360> to<00:01:18.479> 6<00:01:18.720> so

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
6 grams in the original sent to 6 so

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:20.810 
6 grams in the original sent to 6 so
it's<00:01:19.290> gonna<00:01:19.380> be<00:01:19.470> a<00:01:19.530> lot<00:01:19.710> better<00:01:19.920> for<00:01:20.280> like<00:01:20.430> say

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
it's gonna be a lot better for like say

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:23.630 
it's gonna be a lot better for like say
a<00:01:20.850> post-workout<00:01:21.810> protein<00:01:22.009> or<00:01:23.009> a<00:01:23.040> first<00:01:23.430> thing

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
a post-workout protein or a first thing

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:25.069 
a post-workout protein or a first thing
in<00:01:23.759> the<00:01:23.820> morning<00:01:24.149> protein<00:01:24.479> not<00:01:24.570> so<00:01:24.869> much

00:01:25.069 --> 00:01:25.079 
in the morning protein not so much

00:01:25.079 --> 00:01:27.050 
in the morning protein not so much
throughout<00:01:25.799> the<00:01:25.920> day<00:01:26.220> protein<00:01:26.520> like<00:01:26.939> the

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
throughout the day protein like the

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:29.450 
throughout the day protein like the
original<00:01:27.540> sent<00:01:27.750> to<00:01:27.869> 6<00:01:28.140> and<00:01:28.409> then<00:01:28.829> there's<00:01:29.009> 25

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
original sent to 6 and then there's 25

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:31.999 
original sent to 6 and then there's 25
grams<00:01:29.729> of<00:01:29.939> protein<00:01:30.000> each<00:01:30.600> serving<00:01:31.110> only<00:01:31.530> 7

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:32.009 
grams of protein each serving only 7

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:34.010 
grams of protein each serving only 7
grams<00:01:32.250> of<00:01:32.460> carbs<00:01:32.820> 2<00:01:33.119> which<00:01:33.390> are<00:01:33.570> again<00:01:33.990> that

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
grams of carbs 2 which are again that

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:36.620 
grams of carbs 2 which are again that
fiber<00:01:34.500> it's<00:01:35.130> gonna<00:01:35.220> again<00:01:35.700> hold<00:01:36.149> you<00:01:36.299> over<00:01:36.600> a

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
fiber it's gonna again hold you over a

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:38.179 
fiber it's gonna again hold you over a
little<00:01:36.869> bit<00:01:37.079> longer<00:01:37.469> and<00:01:37.710> just<00:01:37.890> give<00:01:38.040> it<00:01:38.070> a

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:38.189 
little bit longer and just give it a

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:40.310 
little bit longer and just give it a
little<00:01:38.310> bit<00:01:38.490> better<00:01:38.610> texture<00:01:39.329> so<00:01:39.899> all<00:01:40.079> in<00:01:40.229> all

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320 
little bit better texture so all in all

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:43.069 
little bit better texture so all in all
it's<00:01:40.619> a<00:01:40.799> great<00:01:41.280> protein<00:01:42.030> especially<00:01:42.360> when<00:01:42.990> you

00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:43.079 
it's a great protein especially when you

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:45.620 
it's a great protein especially when you
compare<00:01:43.469> it<00:01:43.500> to<00:01:43.649> the<00:01:43.740> old<00:01:43.770> syntha-6<00:01:44.520> which<00:01:45.450> is

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
compare it to the old syntha-6 which is

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:48.289 
compare it to the old syntha-6 which is
more<00:01:45.869> of<00:01:46.049> a<00:01:46.369> throughout<00:01:47.369> the<00:01:47.610> day<00:01:47.850> meal

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:48.299 
more of a throughout the day meal

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:50.420 
more of a throughout the day meal
