you can see here depending on the amount
of<00:02:42.390> residue<00:02:42.840> on<00:02:42.870> the<00:02:43.290> hair<00:02:43.470> system<00:02:43.950> you<00:02:44.310> will

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:44.430 
of residue on the hair system you will

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:47.420 
of residue on the hair system you will
need<00:02:44.640> to<00:02:44.790> slide<00:02:45.060> more<00:02:45.390> or<00:02:45.660> less<00:02:46.430> basically

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:47.430 
need to slide more or less basically

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:48.830 
need to slide more or less basically
what<00:02:47.790> you'll<00:02:47.940> want<00:02:48.120> to<00:02:48.180> do<00:02:48.360> is<00:02:48.540> pick<00:02:48.810> a

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:50.820 
starting point on the hair system I'm

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:55.310 
starting point on the hair system I'm
gonna<00:02:51.269> start<00:02:51.600> right<00:02:51.810> here<00:02:53.750> you'll<00:02:54.750> press<00:02:55.140> it

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:55.320 
gonna start right here you'll press it

00:03:00.949 --> 00:03:00.959 
firm pressure and you want to slide the

00:03:00.959 --> 00:03:04.310 
firm pressure and you want to slide the
base<00:03:01.170> down<00:03:01.709> the<00:03:01.920> mirror<00:03:02.160> like<00:03:02.489> this<00:03:03.170> you<00:03:04.170> want

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:04.320 
base down the mirror like this you want

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:06.620 
base down the mirror like this you want
to<00:03:04.410> make<00:03:04.590> sure<00:03:04.620> that<00:03:05.040> you're<00:03:05.220> rotating<00:03:05.880> each

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:06.630 
to make sure that you're rotating each

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:10.759 
to make sure that you're rotating each
time<00:03:07.110> that<00:03:07.380> you<00:03:07.500> do<00:03:07.709> this<00:03:07.890> and<00:03:09.650> continue<00:03:10.650> to

00:03:10.759 --> 00:03:10.769 
time that you do this and continue to

00:03:10.769 --> 00:03:12.920 
time that you do this and continue to
slide<00:03:11.070> it<00:03:11.220> down<00:03:11.250> the<00:03:12.120> reason<00:03:12.480> that<00:03:12.570> you<00:03:12.690> want

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:12.930 
slide it down the reason that you want

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:15.890 
slide it down the reason that you want
to<00:03:13.050> rotate<00:03:13.230> the<00:03:13.650> base<00:03:13.830> is<00:03:14.269> because<00:03:15.269> you<00:03:15.660> don't

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:15.900 
to rotate the base is because you don't

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:18.259 
to rotate the base is because you don't
want<00:03:16.110> to<00:03:16.230> slide<00:03:16.620> the<00:03:16.920> same<00:03:17.160> area<00:03:17.610> and<00:03:18.000> you<00:03:18.090> also

00:03:18.259 --> 00:03:18.269 
want to slide the same area and you also

00:03:18.269 --> 00:03:22.699 
want to slide the same area and you also
want<00:03:18.690> to<00:03:18.750> move<00:03:19.910> from<00:03:21.320> away<00:03:22.320> from<00:03:22.350> this

00:03:22.699 --> 00:03:22.709 
want to move from away from this

00:03:22.709 --> 00:03:25.670 
want to move from away from this
adhesive<00:03:23.100> because<00:03:24.030> if<00:03:24.180> you<00:03:24.299> actually<00:03:24.650> do<00:03:25.650> that

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:25.680 
adhesive because if you actually do that

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:28.430 
adhesive because if you actually do that
it's<00:03:26.250> gonna<00:03:26.430> push<00:03:26.760> the<00:03:26.970> adhesive<00:03:27.450> back<00:03:27.930> into

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:28.440 
it's gonna push the adhesive back into

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:29.990 
it's gonna push the adhesive back into
the<00:03:28.560> hair<00:03:28.739> system<00:03:29.190> so<00:03:29.549> I'm<00:03:29.670> just<00:03:29.880> gonna

00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:30.000 
the hair system so I'm just gonna

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.380 
the hair system so I'm just gonna
continue<00:03:30.410> to<00:03:31.410> rotate<00:03:31.680> and<00:03:32.190> slide<00:03:32.489> the<00:03:32.940> system

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:33.390 
continue to rotate and slide the system

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:36.620 
continue to rotate and slide the system
and<00:03:33.690> as<00:03:34.230> you<00:03:34.410> can<00:03:34.620> see<00:03:34.890> the<00:03:35.549> residue<00:03:36.209> is

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:36.630 
and as you can see the residue is

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:38.840 
and as you can see the residue is
transferring<00:03:37.410> from<00:03:37.620> the<00:03:37.709> base<00:03:38.010> onto<00:03:38.610> the

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:38.850 
transferring from the base onto the

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:42.410 
transferring from the base onto the
mirror<00:03:39.890> here's<00:03:40.890> a<00:03:40.980> tip<00:03:41.280> even<00:03:42.209> though<00:03:42.360> you

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:42.420 
mirror here's a tip even though you

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:44.509 
mirror here's a tip even though you
might<00:03:42.750> not<00:03:42.810> be<00:03:43.110> able<00:03:43.350> to<00:03:43.440> see<00:03:43.680> any<00:03:43.860> adhesive

00:03:44.509 --> 00:03:44.519 
might not be able to see any adhesive

00:03:44.519 --> 00:03:47.060 
might not be able to see any adhesive
you<00:03:44.940> might<00:03:45.150> be<00:03:45.269> able<00:03:45.390> to<00:03:45.510> feel<00:03:45.780> some<00:03:46.110> feel

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:47.070 
you might be able to feel some feel

00:03:47.070 --> 00:03:48.979 
you might be able to feel some feel
around<00:03:47.340> the<00:03:47.459> edge<00:03:47.670> of<00:03:47.910> the<00:03:48.030> base<00:03:48.239> like<00:03:48.660> this

00:03:48.979 --> 00:03:48.989 
around the edge of the base like this

00:03:48.989 --> 00:03:51.490 
around the edge of the base like this
and<00:03:49.320> see<00:03:49.590> if<00:03:49.680> you<00:03:49.829> feel<00:03:50.010> anything<00:03:50.610> sticky<00:03:51.000> if

00:03:51.490 --> 00:03:51.500 
and see if you feel anything sticky if

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:55.340 
and see if you feel anything sticky if
you<00:03:52.500> do<00:03:52.680> continue<00:03:53.400> sliding<00:03:53.670> if<00:03:54.120> you<00:03:54.900> can't<00:03:55.170> get

00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:55.350 
you do continue sliding if you can't get

00:03:55.350 --> 00:03:57.319 
you do continue sliding if you can't get
all<00:03:55.530> of<00:03:55.680> the<00:03:55.829> tackiness<00:03:56.220> off<00:03:56.579> don't<00:03:57.060> worry

00:03:57.319 --> 00:03:57.329 
all of the tackiness off don't worry

00:03:57.329 --> 00:03:59.180 
all of the tackiness off don't worry
we're<00:03:57.840> going<00:03:57.989> to<00:03:58.110> follow<00:03:58.350> this<00:03:58.680> up<00:03:58.739> with<00:03:58.980> a

00:03:59.180 --> 00:03:59.190 
we're going to follow this up with a

00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:01.340 
we're going to follow this up with a
light<00:03:59.489> coat<00:03:59.760> of<00:03:59.790> solvent<00:04:00.360> to<00:04:00.570> remove<00:04:00.600> any<00:04:01.019> last

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:01.350 
light coat of solvent to remove any last

00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:04.250 
light coat of solvent to remove any last
traces<00:04:01.739> of<00:04:02.070> residue<00:04:02.570> so<00:04:03.570> you'll<00:04:03.750> just<00:04:03.810> want<00:04:04.079> to

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:04.260 
traces of residue so you'll just want to

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:06.410 
traces of residue so you'll just want to
continue<00:04:04.560> sliding<00:04:05.160> like<00:04:05.340> this<00:04:05.640> until<00:04:06.239> you've

00:04:06.410 --> 00:04:06.420 
continue sliding like this until you've

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:09.880 
continue sliding like this until you've
removed<00:04:06.750> all<00:04:07.019> of<00:04:07.079> the<00:04:07.350> adhesive

00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:09.890 
removed all of the adhesive

00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:12.550 
removed all of the adhesive
the<00:04:10.550> mirror<00:04:10.790> side<00:04:11.090> already<00:04:11.600> removed<00:04:12.050> most<00:04:12.350> of

00:04:12.550 --> 00:04:12.560 
the mirror side already removed most of

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:14.710 
the mirror side already removed most of
the<00:04:12.710> adhesive<00:04:13.010> from<00:04:13.370> the<00:04:13.580> base<00:04:13.760> but<00:04:14.540> there's

00:04:14.710 --> 00:04:14.720 
the adhesive from the base but there's

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:16.900 
the adhesive from the base but there's
always<00:04:15.140> trace<00:04:15.500> amounts<00:04:16.040> that<00:04:16.190> you<00:04:16.340> can't<00:04:16.609> see

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:16.910 
always trace amounts that you can't see

00:04:16.910 --> 00:04:19.780 
always trace amounts that you can't see
or<00:04:17.060> feel<00:04:17.090> as<00:04:17.570> a<00:04:18.290> precaution<00:04:19.070> we<00:04:19.280> recommend

00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:19.790 
or feel as a precaution we recommend

00:04:19.790 --> 00:04:21.670 
or feel as a precaution we recommend
that<00:04:20.030> you<00:04:20.180> follow<00:04:20.390> up<00:04:20.720> with<00:04:20.959> a<00:04:20.989> very<00:04:21.380> light

00:04:21.670 --> 00:04:21.680 
that you follow up with a very light

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:24.220 
that you follow up with a very light
spray<00:04:22.190> of<00:04:22.430> solvent<00:04:22.910> in<00:04:23.270> this<00:04:23.570> case<00:04:23.870> I'm<00:04:24.170> using

00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:24.230 
spray of solvent in this case I'm using

00:04:24.230 --> 00:04:27.670 
spray of solvent in this case I'm using
the<00:04:24.710> c22<00:04:25.370> solvent<00:04:26.030> and<00:04:26.240> I'm<00:04:26.720> only<00:04:26.930> using<00:04:27.290> a

00:04:27.670 --> 00:04:27.680 
the c22 solvent and I'm only using a

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:31.000 
the c22 solvent and I'm only using a
very<00:04:28.160> little<00:04:28.850> bit<00:04:29.380> we've<00:04:30.380> already<00:04:30.590> cleaned

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:31.010 
very little bit we've already cleaned

00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:33.070 
very little bit we've already cleaned
off<00:04:31.220> most<00:04:31.550> of<00:04:31.730> the<00:04:31.880> adhesives<00:04:32.420> so<00:04:32.690> this<00:04:32.900> is

00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:33.080 
off most of the adhesives so this is

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:35.800 
off most of the adhesives so this is
just<00:04:33.260> used<00:04:33.650> to<00:04:34.010> remove<00:04:34.280> any<00:04:34.580> stubborn<00:04:35.090> residue

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:35.810 
just used to remove any stubborn residue

00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:38.950 
just used to remove any stubborn residue
so<00:04:36.500> you<00:04:36.890> don't<00:04:37.070> need<00:04:37.190> a<00:04:37.250> lot<00:04:37.520> at<00:04:37.760> this<00:04:38.570> point

00:04:38.950 --> 00:04:38.960 
so you don't need a lot at this point

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:40.810 
so you don't need a lot at this point
you'll<00:04:39.320> want<00:04:39.380> to<00:04:39.590> let<00:04:39.740> the<00:04:39.890> solvent<00:04:40.340> sit<00:04:40.640> at

00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:40.820 
you'll want to let the solvent sit at

00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:43.540 
you'll want to let the solvent sit at
least<00:04:41.150> 15<00:04:41.660> minutes<00:04:42.050> but<00:04:42.740> since<00:04:43.040> there's<00:04:43.310> such

00:04:43.540 --> 00:04:43.550 
least 15 minutes but since there's such

00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:45.700 
least 15 minutes but since there's such
a<00:04:43.580> little<00:04:43.880> bit<00:04:44.120> it<00:04:44.390> won't<00:04:44.750> hurt<00:04:44.990> to<00:04:45.080> let<00:04:45.380> it<00:04:45.500> sit

00:04:45.700 --> 00:04:45.710 
a little bit it won't hurt to let it sit

00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:47.740 
a little bit it won't hurt to let it sit
like<00:04:45.890> this<00:04:45.919> overnight<00:04:46.610> and<00:04:46.940> that's<00:04:47.180> it<00:04:47.510> after

00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:49.880 
you've waited at least 15 minutes you

00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:51.310 
you've waited at least 15 minutes you
