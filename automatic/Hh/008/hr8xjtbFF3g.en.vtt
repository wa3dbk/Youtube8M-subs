00:00:15.549 --> 00:00:18.279
 with the study with 

00:00:18.279 --> 00:00:20.220
 China is acquiring more 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:23.220
 we'll see 

00:00:24.179 --> 00:00:25.970
 and here we are 

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:29.240
 martial with the valley that I do if he wants to see anyone this fills me with illusion 

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:32.279
 as a little boy he was about 300 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:33.960
 in magic it's still 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:35.100
 the farmhouse 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:38.649
 budding desirable that the ones that make us the most now are going to happen 

00:00:38.649 --> 00:00:41.130
 I could not logically miss 

00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:43.570
 and there was a card game 

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:45.040
 and I will try 

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:47.400
 on this occasion demonstrate 

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:51.740
 the order of the universe as we know the universe is formed by some laws 

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:53.880
 inexorable 

00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:58.160
 mathematically possible there on 1 the 2003 the 4 and the 5 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:00.140
 it is logical not 

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:02.070
 but I wanted to invest 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:03.180
 in that order 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:04.650
 what would happen 

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:06.860
 now in the league upside down 4 

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:11.810
 you would be a judge 5 4 3 2 and that is how we are going to do the same 

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:16.969
 and we are going to try to show that mathematics can fail 

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:21.240
 it's as 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:24.850
 4 by5 first comes fabrics min 

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:27.130
 after the meeting the 2 yes 

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:28.560
 after two 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:31.560
 logically in it the 3 

00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:33.980
 and after 4 

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:35.200
 the 7 5 

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:37.630
 but we were going to invest in that order 

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:39.350
 only do so 

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:42.350
 instead of five there should be 

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:46.360
 after the 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:48.780
 then 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:51.410
 it would be 3 

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:53.750
 let's go after 4% 

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:55.870
 and finally the 

00:01:55.870 --> 00:01:57.840
 the 5 arrechea orlov 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:00.840
 miguel garcia who said it was like that 

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:04.600
 Three weeks after taxes from 11 12 h 

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:07.600
 Yes now 

00:02:20.159 --> 00:02:23.279
 the head of the state executive 

00:02:23.279 --> 00:02:26.279
 most people 

00:02:26.949 --> 00:02:29.719
 in sight with these three wonderful phrases 

00:02:29.719 --> 00:02:33.700
 French are showing up these phones all at a given moment 

00:02:33.699 --> 00:02:35.739
 can stretch this event 

00:02:35.739 --> 00:02:40.349
 presentations effectively has the face and in Cancun with the idea of â€‹â€‹power 

00:02:41.009 --> 00:02:43.919
 after making presentations of the games 

00:02:43.919 --> 00:02:46.919
 and from the magic of karadima jiabao the redundancy 

00:02:47.769 --> 00:02:49.439
 karzai that peÃ±alosa 

00:02:49.439 --> 00:02:51.899
 then we will continue here to may 

00:02:51.899 --> 00:02:55.939
 and this program is despite Spain and we have many surprises so let's go 

00:02:55.939 --> 00:02:58.149
 to the work 

00:02:58.149 --> 00:03:01.149
 for her 

00:03:23.549 --> 00:03:24.319
