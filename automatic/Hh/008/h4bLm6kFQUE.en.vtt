Americans<00:01:21.720> have<00:01:22.500> it<00:01:22.740> so<00:01:23.159> it<00:01:23.820> can<00:01:24.210> rid<00:01:24.509> itself

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930 
Americans have it so it can rid itself

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:28.039 
Americans have it so it can rid itself
in<00:01:25.619> about<00:01:25.770> one<00:01:26.340> to<00:01:26.430> two<00:01:26.580> years<00:01:27.000> obviously<00:01:27.810> the

in about one to two years obviously the

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:29.960 
in about one to two years obviously the

younger that you are our immune systems

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:32.990 
younger that you are our immune systems
are<00:01:30.090> healthier<00:01:30.570> so<00:01:31.170> it<00:01:31.320> can<00:01:31.439> be<00:01:31.560> dormant<00:01:32.009> even

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000 
are healthier so it can be dormant even

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.120 
are healthier so it can be dormant even
if<00:01:33.119> it<00:01:33.240> didn't<00:01:33.689> if<00:01:33.780> your<00:01:33.960> body<00:01:34.170> let's<00:01:34.530> just<00:01:34.799> say

if it didn't if your body let's just say

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:36.890 
if it didn't if your body let's just say

did not read itself it can be dormant in
your<00:01:37.049> body<00:01:37.259> up<00:01:37.560> to<00:01:37.710> 20<00:01:38.189> to<00:01:38.400> 30<00:01:38.820> years<00:01:39.329> so<00:01:40.170> this

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
your body up to 20 to 30 years so this

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:42.920 
your body up to 20 to 30 years so this
isn't<00:01:40.740> something<00:01:41.009> that<00:01:41.520> if<00:01:41.700> you<00:01:41.850> do<00:01:42.150> get<00:01:42.360> HPV

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:46.100 
isn't something that if you do get HPV
that<00:01:43.860> you<00:01:43.979> could<00:01:44.189> say<00:01:44.399> oh<00:01:44.610> hey<00:01:45.119> I<00:01:45.420> can<00:01:45.780> track<00:01:46.079> it

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.110 
that you could say oh hey I can track it

00:03:42.259 --> 00:03:42.269 
obviously are where to look at HPV

00:03:42.269 --> 00:03:44.479 
obviously are where to look at HPV
positive<00:03:42.480> in<00:03:43.019> the<00:03:43.380> oral<00:03:43.650> cavity<00:03:43.680> is<00:03:44.130> going<00:03:44.400> to

00:03:44.479 --> 00:03:44.489 
positive in the oral cavity is going to

00:03:44.489 --> 00:03:46.569 
positive in the oral cavity is going to
be<00:03:44.609> more<00:03:44.819> towards<00:03:45.209> the<00:03:45.389> back<00:03:45.750> of<00:03:46.049> your<00:03:46.290> throat

alcohol UV you know family history it

00:03:52.079 --> 00:03:53.690 
alcohol UV you know family history it
might<00:03:52.200> be<00:03:52.350> towards<00:03:52.680> the<00:03:52.739> front<00:03:53.190> of<00:03:53.340> your<00:03:53.579> mouth

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:55.290 
so when you're doing the oral cancer

00:03:55.290 --> 00:03:57.470 
so when you're doing the oral cancer
screening<00:03:55.519> and<00:03:56.519> I<00:03:56.549> encourage<00:03:56.880> saying<00:03:57.209> that

00:03:57.470 --> 00:03:57.480 
screening and I encourage saying that

00:03:57.480 --> 00:03:59.750 
screening and I encourage saying that
make<00:03:58.019> sure<00:03:58.319> that<00:03:58.349> you<00:03:58.500> extend<00:03:59.099> the<00:03:59.340> tongue<00:03:59.549> out

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:02.730 
and that you have them say ah so we can

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:04.640 
and that you have them say ah so we can
see<00:04:03.000> anything<00:04:03.389> going<00:04:03.569> on<00:04:03.750> the<00:04:03.930> soft<00:04:04.170> palate

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:04.650 
see anything going on the soft palate

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:06.740 
see anything going on the soft palate
and<00:04:04.739> as<00:04:05.220> it<00:04:05.370> starts<00:04:05.670> to<00:04:05.819> go<00:04:05.910> down<00:04:05.940> the<00:04:06.269> throat

00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:06.750 
and as it starts to go down the throat

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:08.750 
and as it starts to go down the throat
that's<00:04:07.170> where<00:04:07.410> HPV<00:04:07.859> is<00:04:07.950> gonna<00:04:08.099> be<00:04:08.160> found<00:04:08.340> not

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:08.760 
that's where HPV is gonna be found not

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:11.210 
that's where HPV is gonna be found not
on<00:04:08.819> a<00:04:08.940> positive<00:04:09.420> side<00:04:09.630> though<00:04:09.980> HPV<00:04:10.980> positive

00:04:11.210 --> 00:04:11.220 
on a positive side though HPV positive

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:14.960 
on a positive side though HPV positive
patients<00:04:12.030> once<00:04:12.419> we<00:04:12.660> find<00:04:13.079> that<00:04:13.380> cancer<00:04:14.130> the

00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:14.970 
patients once we find that cancer the

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:16.580 
patients once we find that cancer the
good<00:04:15.269> news<00:04:15.480> is<00:04:15.660> they<00:04:15.840> respond<00:04:16.260> better<00:04:16.470> to

00:04:16.580 --> 00:04:16.590 
good news is they respond better to

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:19.099 
good news is they respond better to
treatment<00:04:17.160> that's<00:04:18.000> the<00:04:18.539> thing<00:04:18.690> that<00:04:18.720> I<00:04:18.900> think

00:04:19.099 --> 00:04:19.109 
treatment that's the thing that I think

00:04:19.109 --> 00:04:20.990 
treatment that's the thing that I think
people<00:04:19.229> really<00:04:19.560> need<00:04:19.769> to<00:04:19.799> hear<00:04:20.160> because<00:04:20.760> once

00:04:20.990 --> 00:04:21.000 
people really need to hear because once

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:23.060 
people really need to hear because once
you<00:04:21.120> find<00:04:21.450> it<00:04:21.599> and<00:04:21.870> it's<00:04:22.200> not<00:04:22.409> HPV<00:04:22.950> related

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:23.070 
you find it and it's not HPV related

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:25.670 
you find it and it's not HPV related
those<00:04:23.640> statistics<00:04:24.300> it's<00:04:24.630> not<00:04:24.930> good<00:04:25.140> Kevin<00:04:25.440> you

00:04:25.670 --> 00:04:25.680 
those statistics it's not good Kevin you

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:27.150 
those statistics it's not good Kevin you
have<00:04:25.860> maybe

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:27.160 
have maybe

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:30.690 
have maybe
five<00:04:27.340> year<00:04:28.080> 57<00:04:29.080> chance<00:04:29.350> of<00:04:29.560> survival<00:04:30.100> I<00:04:30.340> don't

00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:30.700 
five year 57 chance of survival I don't

00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:32.250 
five year 57 chance of survival I don't
like<00:04:30.850> those<00:04:31.030> statistics<00:04:31.630> I<00:04:31.840> don't<00:04:32.110> know<00:04:32.170> about

00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:32.260 
like those statistics I don't know about

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:35.400 
like those statistics I don't know about
you<00:04:33.090> know<00:04:34.090> and<00:04:34.300> it's<00:04:34.390> dental<00:04:34.630> professionals<00:04:35.260> I

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:35.410 
you know and it's dental professionals I

00:04:35.410 --> 00:04:37.200 
you know and it's dental professionals I
mean<00:04:35.560> no<00:04:35.770> one<00:04:35.950> should<00:04:36.160> like<00:04:36.340> to<00:04:36.520> statistics

00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:37.210 
mean no one should like to statistics

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:38.970 
mean no one should like to statistics
and<00:04:37.330> hopefully<00:04:37.690> that's<00:04:37.900> even<00:04:38.440> more<00:04:38.470> of<00:04:38.890> a

00:04:38.970 --> 00:04:38.980 
and hopefully that's even more of a

00:04:38.980 --> 00:04:40.440 
and hopefully that's even more of a
reason<00:04:39.160> to<00:04:39.370> start<00:04:39.670> that<00:04:39.820> oral<00:04:40.060> cancer

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:40.450 
reason to start that oral cancer

00:04:40.450 --> 00:04:42.690 
reason to start that oral cancer
screening<00:04:40.480> process<00:04:41.440> and<00:04:41.710> the<00:04:41.830> education<00:04:42.460> even

00:04:42.690 --> 00:04:42.700 
screening process and the education even

00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:44.340 
screening process and the education even
though<00:04:42.790> it<00:04:42.910> may<00:04:43.000> be<00:04:43.030> uncomfortable<00:04:43.750> it's

00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:44.350 
though it may be uncomfortable it's

00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:46.530 
though it may be uncomfortable it's
still<00:04:44.680> a<00:04:44.710> sample<00:04:45.580> just<00:04:45.940> hearing<00:04:46.240> that<00:04:46.330> right

00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:46.540 
still a sample just hearing that right

00:04:46.540 --> 00:04:47.940 
still a sample just hearing that right
there's<00:04:46.780> a<00:04:46.840> great<00:04:47.050> reason<00:04:47.530> to<00:04:47.560> get<00:04:47.680> off<00:04:47.800> the

00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:47.950 
there's a great reason to get off the

there's a great reason to get off the
bench<00:04:48.130> and<00:04:48.310> start<00:04:48.550> doing<00:04:48.790> this<00:04:49.350> right<00:04:50.350> it
