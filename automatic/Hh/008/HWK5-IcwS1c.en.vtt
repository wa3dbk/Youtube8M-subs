your gang corner perhaps another example
will<00:02:50.040> help<00:02:53.030> this<00:02:54.030> whole<00:02:54.269> white<00:02:54.510> stuff<00:02:54.870> up<00:02:55.019> the

00:02:55.189 --> 00:02:55.199 
will help this whole white stuff up the

00:02:55.199 --> 00:03:04.640 
will help this whole white stuff up the
ramps<00:03:01.730> this<00:03:02.730> one<00:03:02.969> is<00:03:03.269> the<00:03:03.689> swinging<00:03:04.319> are

straight where you look upwards over the

00:03:08.549 --> 00:03:13.309 
straight where you look upwards over the
mouse<00:03:08.760> and<00:03:10.969> you<00:03:11.969> should<00:03:12.510> move<00:03:12.959> like<00:03:13.290> a

00:03:13.309 --> 00:03:13.319 
mouse and you should move like a

00:03:13.319 --> 00:03:16.879 
mouse and you should move like a
pendulum<00:03:13.889> that's<00:03:14.849> how<00:03:15.060> it<00:03:15.090> works<00:03:15.590> I'll<00:03:16.590> show

00:03:16.879 --> 00:03:16.889 
pendulum that's how it works I'll show

start<00:03:42.720> which<00:03:43.109> I'm<00:03:43.319> not<00:03:43.530> very<00:03:43.739> good<00:03:43.889> i<00:03:44.159> think

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:44.430 
start which I'm not very good i think

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:49.610 
start which I'm not very good i think
this<00:03:44.909> is<00:03:45.030> how<00:03:45.209> it<00:03:45.359> goes<00:03:45.569> I<00:03:48.199> think<00:03:49.199> I'll<00:03:49.319> stuff

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:49.620 
this is how it goes I think I'll stuff

00:03:49.620 --> 00:04:04.100 
this is how it goes I think I'll stuff
that<00:03:49.650> one<00:03:50.069> are<00:03:50.250> back<00:03:50.459> so<00:03:50.639> I'll<00:03:50.759> do<00:03:50.970> it<00:03:51.090> again

00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:04.110 

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:06.600 

you<00:04:05.110> can<00:04:05.290> tell<00:04:05.500> them<00:04:05.650> a<00:04:05.709> lot<00:04:05.860> of<00:04:05.980> creeps<00:04:06.220> player

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:06.610 
you can tell them a lot of creeps player

00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:12.900 
you can tell them a lot of creeps player
so<00:04:06.970> yeah<00:04:07.920> they<00:04:08.920> swing<00:04:09.550> it<00:04:09.810> sideways<00:04:10.810> like<00:04:11.760> in<00:04:12.760> a

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:12.910 
so yeah they swing it sideways like in a

00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:15.360 
so yeah they swing it sideways like in a
very<00:04:13.420> horizontal<00:04:13.870> position<00:04:14.709> and<00:04:14.980> they<00:04:15.100> can

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:15.370 
very horizontal position and they can

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:17.550 
very horizontal position and they can
gain<00:04:15.550> some<00:04:15.610> speed<00:04:16.030> I'll<00:04:17.019> show<00:04:17.350> you<00:04:17.410> something

00:04:17.550 --> 00:04:17.560 
gain some speed I'll show you something

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:21.390 
gain some speed I'll show you something
that<00:04:18.630> the<00:04:19.630> method<00:04:20.049> the<00:04:20.470> ways<00:04:20.650> how<00:04:20.919> you<00:04:20.950> do<00:04:21.250> it

00:04:21.390 --> 00:04:21.400 
that the method the ways how you do it

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:23.909 
that the method the ways how you do it
I'll<00:04:21.549> start<00:04:22.030> off<00:04:22.120> with<00:04:22.419> my<00:04:22.690> circle<00:04:23.230> strafe<00:04:23.530> the

00:04:23.909 --> 00:04:23.919 
I'll start off with my circle strafe the

00:04:23.919 --> 00:04:28.170 
I'll start off with my circle strafe the
way<00:04:24.880> how<00:04:25.120> you<00:04:25.180> do<00:04:25.600> the<00:04:25.900> circle<00:04:26.290> strife<00:04:26.590> is<00:04:27.180> you

00:04:28.170 --> 00:04:28.180 
way how you do the circle strife is you

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:31.470 
way how you do the circle strife is you
perform<00:04:28.810> a<00:04:29.410> mouse<00:04:30.340> movement<00:04:31.060> in<00:04:31.150> the<00:04:31.240> full

00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:31.480 
perform a mouse movement in the full

00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:34.110 
perform a mouse movement in the full
circle<00:04:31.990> and<00:04:32.140> then<00:04:32.590> go<00:04:32.800> horizontal<00:04:33.730> left<00:04:33.910> and

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:34.120 
circle and then go horizontal left and

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:38.850 
circle and then go horizontal left and
right<00:04:34.270> on<00:04:35.340> your<00:04:36.340> mouse<00:04:36.490> and<00:04:37.380> then<00:04:38.380> you<00:04:38.590> should

00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:38.860 
right on your mouse and then you should

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:59.879 
right on your mouse and then you should
pick<00:04:39.040> up<00:04:39.100> some<00:04:39.250> speed<00:04:39.610> like<00:04:39.940> this<00:04:58.320> and<00:04:59.320> compare

00:04:59.879 --> 00:04:59.889 
pick up some speed like this and compare

00:04:59.889 --> 00:05:19.790 
pick up some speed like this and compare
it<00:04:59.919> with<00:05:00.120> just<00:05:01.120> the<00:05:01.360> Regal<00:05:01.720> startup

00:05:19.790 --> 00:05:19.800 

00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:22.320 

now<00:05:20.800> do<00:05:20.860> you<00:05:21.100> see<00:05:21.280> the<00:05:21.430> difference<00:05:21.460> between

00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:22.330 
now do you see the difference between

00:05:22.330 --> 00:05:25.170 
now do you see the difference between
the<00:05:22.450> two<00:05:22.660> stroke<00:05:23.050> the<00:05:23.740> two<00:05:24.010> methods<00:05:24.580> that<00:05:25.000> I've

00:05:25.170 --> 00:05:25.180 
the two stroke the two methods that I've

00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:31.909 
the two stroke the two methods that I've
shown<00:05:25.510> you<00:05:25.540> and<00:05:26.020> I'll<00:05:27.010> do<00:05:27.280> the<00:05:27.310> swing<00:05:27.910> arc

00:05:31.909 --> 00:05:31.919 

00:05:31.919 --> 00:05:35.220 

where<00:05:32.919> you<00:05:33.100> look<00:05:33.220> upwards<00:05:33.910> and<00:05:34.060> go<00:05:34.480> sideways

00:05:35.220 --> 00:05:35.230 
where you look upwards and go sideways

00:05:35.230 --> 00:05:39.690 
where you look upwards and go sideways
and<00:05:36.190> it<00:05:36.550> feels<00:05:36.910> like<00:05:37.120> you're<00:05:37.830> being<00:05:38.830> hit<00:05:39.400> quite

00:05:39.690 --> 00:05:39.700 
and it feels like you're being hit quite

00:05:39.700 --> 00:05:43.850 
and it feels like you're being hit quite
ball<00:05:40.120> swinging<00:05:41.050> both<00:05:41.350> ways<00:05:41.410> like<00:05:41.860> a<00:05:41.919> pendulum

00:05:43.850 --> 00:05:43.860 
ball swinging both ways like a pendulum

00:05:43.860 --> 00:05:46.770 
ball swinging both ways like a pendulum
look<00:05:44.860> at<00:05:45.010> that<00:05:45.160> spin<00:05:45.550> I<00:05:45.580> just<00:05:45.970> got<00:05:46.180> in<00:05:46.389> a<00:05:46.480> short

00:05:46.770 --> 00:05:46.780 
look at that spin I just got in a short

00:05:46.780 --> 00:05:56.520 
look at that spin I just got in a short
period<00:05:46.840> of<00:05:47.320> time<00:05:54.479> I'll<00:05:55.479> shell<00:05:55.930> to<00:05:56.169> you<00:05:56.290> again

00:05:56.520 --> 00:05:56.530 
period of time I'll shell to you again

00:05:56.530 --> 00:05:59.129 
period of time I'll shell to you again
the<00:05:57.280> way<00:05:57.490> how<00:05:57.760> you<00:05:57.820> do<00:05:58.180> it<00:05:58.330> is<00:05:58.479> that<00:05:58.660> you're

00:05:59.129 --> 00:05:59.139 
the way how you do it is that you're

00:05:59.139 --> 00:06:02.700 
the way how you do it is that you're
gonna<00:05:59.440> move<00:05:59.650> your<00:05:59.889> mouse<00:06:00.450> upwards<00:06:01.450> on<00:06:01.720> a<00:06:01.780> 45

00:06:02.700 --> 00:06:02.710 
gonna move your mouse upwards on a 45

00:06:02.710 --> 00:06:07.890 
gonna move your mouse upwards on a 45
degree<00:06:02.889> angle<00:06:03.270> and<00:06:04.290> then<00:06:05.290> you<00:06:05.470> swing<00:06:05.950> it<00:06:06.900> you

00:06:07.890 --> 00:06:07.900 
degree angle and then you swing it you

00:06:07.900 --> 00:06:10.770 
degree angle and then you swing it you
swing<00:06:08.290> it<00:06:08.320> like<00:06:08.440> on<00:06:08.950> a<00:06:08.979> curve<00:06:09.510> like<00:06:10.510> if<00:06:10.690> you

00:06:10.770 --> 00:06:10.780 
swing it like on a curve like if you

00:06:10.780 --> 00:06:13.140 
swing it like on a curve like if you
wander<00:06:11.020> left<00:06:11.410> curve<00:06:11.680> here<00:06:11.889> making<00:06:12.639> you<00:06:12.820> shape

00:06:13.140 --> 00:06:13.150 
wander left curve here making you shape

00:06:13.150 --> 00:06:16.950 
wander left curve here making you shape
in<00:06:13.389> in<00:06:13.840> the<00:06:14.050> opposite<00:06:14.470> way<00:06:14.530> and<00:06:15.030> then<00:06:16.030> swing<00:06:16.840> it

00:06:16.950 --> 00:06:16.960 
in in the opposite way and then swing it

00:06:16.960 --> 00:06:18.750 
in in the opposite way and then swing it
right<00:06:17.169> you<00:06:17.380> do<00:06:17.590> the<00:06:17.889> same<00:06:18.040> thing<00:06:18.100> the<00:06:18.400> opposite

00:06:18.750 --> 00:06:18.760 
right you do the same thing the opposite

00:06:18.760 --> 00:06:33.540 
right you do the same thing the opposite
way<00:06:20.460> I'll<00:06:21.460> I'll<00:06:22.300> show<00:06:22.660> it<00:06:22.750> to<00:06:22.810> you<00:06:22.960> again

00:06:33.540 --> 00:06:33.550 

00:06:33.550 --> 00:06:36.270 

there<00:06:34.150> are<00:06:34.210> also<00:06:34.390> others<00:06:34.990> are<00:06:35.800> different

00:06:36.270 --> 00:06:36.280 
there are also others are different

00:06:36.280 --> 00:06:39.300 
there are also others are different
stroke<00:06:36.550> techniques<00:06:37.030> up<00:06:37.530> that<00:06:38.530> I<00:06:38.560> know<00:06:38.740> but<00:06:39.280> I

00:06:39.300 --> 00:06:39.310 
stroke techniques up that I know but I

00:06:39.310 --> 00:06:41.940 
stroke techniques up that I know but I
haven't<00:06:39.640> learned<00:06:40.120> very<00:06:41.020> well<00:06:41.170> but<00:06:41.470> this<00:06:41.650> is<00:06:41.800> my

00:06:41.940 --> 00:06:41.950 
haven't learned very well but this is my

00:06:41.950 --> 00:06:48.690 
haven't learned very well but this is my
favorite<00:06:42.190> one<00:06:45.780> the<00:06:46.780> circle<00:06:47.230> straight<00:06:47.530> it's<00:06:48.490> so

00:06:48.690 --> 00:06:48.700 
favorite one the circle straight it's so

00:06:48.700 --> 00:06:54.060 
favorite one the circle straight it's so
simple<00:06:48.940> to<00:06:49.090> do<00:06:49.330> for<00:06:49.690> me<00:06:49.810> that's<00:06:52.440> sometimes<00:06:53.440> I

00:06:54.060 --> 00:06:54.070 
simple to do for me that's sometimes I

00:06:54.070 --> 00:06:58.680 
simple to do for me that's sometimes I
do<00:06:54.190> it<00:06:54.490> more<00:06:54.730> than<00:06:54.760> once<00:06:55.000> on<00:06:57.360> real<00:06:58.360> tight

00:06:58.680 --> 00:06:58.690 
do it more than once on real tight

00:06:58.690 --> 00:07:03.300 
do it more than once on real tight
corners<00:06:59.350> like<00:07:00.010> this<00:07:01.260> that<00:07:02.260> was<00:07:02.440> a<00:07:02.470> lousy<00:07:03.010> of

00:07:03.300 --> 00:07:03.310 
corners like this that was a lousy of

00:07:03.310 --> 00:07:29.670 
corners like this that was a lousy of
circle<00:07:03.730> hot<00:07:03.880> on<00:07:26.910> the<00:07:27.910> Vantage's<00:07:28.750> of<00:07:28.990> having<00:07:29.560> a

00:07:29.670 --> 00:07:29.680 
circle hot on the Vantage's of having a

00:07:29.680 --> 00:07:32.130 
circle hot on the Vantage's of having a
priest<00:07:29.980> drive<00:07:30.340> a<00:07:30.610> quite<00:07:30.940> obvious<00:07:31.480> is<00:07:31.750> that

00:07:32.130 --> 00:07:32.140 
priest drive a quite obvious is that

00:07:32.140 --> 00:07:39.320 
priest drive a quite obvious is that
you'll<00:07:33.040> gain<00:07:33.280> speed<00:07:33.910> a<00:07:34.120> lot<00:07:34.360> a<00:07:35.820> lot<00:07:36.820> sooner<00:07:38.100> and

00:07:39.320 --> 00:07:39.330 
you'll gain speed a lot a lot sooner and

00:07:39.330 --> 00:07:42.510 
you'll gain speed a lot a lot sooner and
you're<00:07:40.330> able<00:07:40.480> to<00:07:40.900> perform<00:07:41.350> jump<00:07:41.860> difficult

00:07:42.510 --> 00:07:42.520 
you're able to perform jump difficult

00:07:42.520 --> 00:07:45.230 
you're able to perform jump difficult
jumps<00:07:42.850> on<00:07:43.000> the<00:07:43.120> small<00:07:43.450> male<00:07:43.690> space<00:07:44.110> so<00:07:44.650> yeah

00:07:45.230 --> 00:07:45.240 
jumps on the small male space so yeah

00:07:45.240 --> 00:07:52.140
