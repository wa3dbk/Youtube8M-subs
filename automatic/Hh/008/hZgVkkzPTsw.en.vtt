00:00:07.390 --> 00:00:11.200
 the panasonic 3d camcorder allows to work on any terrain by 

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:12.839
 complicated that is 

00:00:12.839 --> 00:00:16.570
 in movies 2d there are very few interesting subjects like a beautiful 

00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:18.060
 landscape 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:21.060
 the same can be said of a three-dimensional space 

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:26.260
 The scope of the approach of the Panasonic 3D video camera is one meter 

00:00:26.259 --> 00:00:28.550
 to infinity 

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:32.759
 but the best 3d effect will get the interval between 1 and 8 meters 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:35.759
 due to the small axial distance between the two lenses 

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:42.020
 therefore when quilmes three-dimensional landscapes should be a bit 

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:45.770
 creative if you want your images to have depth and you do not settle for 

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:48.770
 a flat image that looks like two days 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:56.210
 after experimenting with different close-ups and alignments as per 

00:00:56.210 --> 00:00:59.210
 example a bush in the foreground and some trees on average 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:06.270
 the objects located in different planes like the rocks in this example 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:09.480
 help to get a very good 3d effect 

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:12.860
 keep in mind that solid objects in the foreground should be 

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:16.330
 a minimum distance of one point five meters to avoid interference in 

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:19.120
 The framing 

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:22.900
 Another attractive 3D effect is to combine a shot of a landscape with an effect of 

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:24.340
 relief 

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:27.340
 so the maximum depth of the camera is used 

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:30.550
 check that the raised object noticed that the top or sides 

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:32.770
 of the frame 

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:36.650
 Hold the camera as firm as possible using a tripod to prevent 

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:39.650
 images that give example the focused blues 

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:44.380
 Also keep in mind that the horizon should be clear 

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:47.880
 since our natural perception the horizontal lines are always 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:49.670
 leveled 

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:53.100
 with a little practice you will see how you constantly improve your skills 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:53.930
 3d
