00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:19.519 
point of what's inside this box I do
know<00:00:17.369> a<00:00:17.670> little<00:00:18.390> bit<00:00:18.510> about<00:00:18.660> its<00:00:18.840> origin<00:00:19.350> and

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:19.529 
know a little bit about its origin and

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:21.710 
know a little bit about its origin and
that<00:00:19.590> is<00:00:20.580> that<00:00:20.699> it<00:00:20.789> comes<00:00:21.000> from<00:00:21.150> a<00:00:21.359> company

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:21.720 
that is that it comes from a company

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:25.009 
that is that it comes from a company
called<00:00:21.750> DIY<00:00:22.320> PC<00:00:23.039> and<00:00:23.460> that<00:00:24.449> this<00:00:24.539> is<00:00:24.720> a<00:00:24.750> sample

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:25.019 
called DIY PC and that this is a sample

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:28.040 
called DIY PC and that this is a sample
product<00:00:25.590> so<00:00:25.970> once<00:00:26.970> we<00:00:27.240> do<00:00:27.359> determine<00:00:27.510> what<00:00:27.930> it

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:28.050 
product so once we do determine what it

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:30.349 
product so once we do determine what it
is<00:00:28.080> and<00:00:28.439> probably<00:00:28.590> put<00:00:28.949> this<00:00:29.099> video<00:00:29.970> on<00:00:30.210> the

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:30.359 
is and probably put this video on the

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:32.510 
is and probably put this video on the
product<00:00:30.720> page<00:00:30.929> you<00:00:31.529> will<00:00:31.650> not<00:00:31.800> necessarily<00:00:31.949> be

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:32.520 
product page you will not necessarily be

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:35.810 
product page you will not necessarily be
getting<00:00:32.820> this<00:00:33.719> exact<00:00:34.700> packaging<00:00:35.700> you'll

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:35.820 
getting this exact packaging you'll

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:37.639 
getting this exact packaging you'll
probably<00:00:36.030> get<00:00:36.300> the<00:00:36.510> get<00:00:37.079> something<00:00:37.440> a<00:00:37.469> little

00:00:37.639 --> 00:00:37.649 
probably get the get something a little

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:39.830 
probably get the get something a little
bit<00:00:37.739> more<00:00:37.890> along<00:00:38.040> the<00:00:38.190> retail<00:00:38.520> looking<00:00:39.480> side

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:39.840 
bit more along the retail looking side

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:44.150 
bit more along the retail looking side
but<00:00:40.739> uh<00:00:41.719> apart<00:00:42.719> from<00:00:42.840> that<00:00:43.020> I'm<00:00:43.680> really<00:00:43.890> not

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
but uh apart from that I'm really not

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:45.920 
but uh apart from that I'm really not
sure<00:00:44.390> what's<00:00:45.390> in<00:00:45.539> here

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:45.930 
sure what's in here

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:49.610 
sure what's in here
although<00:00:46.320> oh<00:00:47.480> well<00:00:48.480> looks<00:00:48.840> just<00:00:49.140> let's<00:00:49.500> just

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620 
although oh well looks just let's just

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:54.049 
although oh well looks just let's just
proceed<00:00:50.039> this<00:00:50.910> is<00:00:51.149> a<00:00:51.300> flat<00:00:51.780> packed<00:00:52.820> looks<00:00:53.820> like

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
proceed this is a flat packed looks like

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:58.069 
proceed this is a flat packed looks like
acrylic<00:00:54.600> panels<00:00:55.550> we<00:00:56.550> have<00:00:56.699> some<00:00:57.030> metal<00:00:57.570> posts

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079 
acrylic panels we have some metal posts

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:01.639 
acrylic panels we have some metal posts
here<00:00:58.350> that<00:00:58.640> will<00:00:59.640> act<00:00:59.850> as<00:01:00.620> separators<00:01:01.620> and

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:01.649 
here that will act as separators and

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:03.439 
here that will act as separators and
more<00:01:02.190> packaging<00:01:02.670> here<00:01:02.789> along<00:01:02.969> the<00:01:03.090> other<00:01:03.180> side

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:03.449 
more packaging here along the other side

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:06.710 
more packaging here along the other side
so<00:01:03.719> this<00:01:04.650> is<00:01:04.860> pretty<00:01:05.070> much<00:01:05.159> it<00:01:05.309> right<00:01:05.760> here<00:01:06.510> and

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
so this is pretty much it right here and

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:08.240 
so this is pretty much it right here and
let<00:01:07.020> me<00:01:07.049> get<00:01:07.200> this<00:01:07.350> out<00:01:07.500> of<00:01:07.619> the<00:01:07.680> styrofoam<00:01:08.220> and

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
let me get this out of the styrofoam and

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:10.760 
let me get this out of the styrofoam and
I<00:01:08.610> can<00:01:09.000> better<00:01:09.330> determine<00:01:09.659> what<00:01:09.990> it<00:01:10.080> is<00:01:10.140> and

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
I can better determine what it is and

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:13.460 
I can better determine what it is and
now<00:01:10.979> the<00:01:11.040> mystery<00:01:11.700> is<00:01:12.000> slowly<00:01:12.360> being<00:01:12.869> solved

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 
now the mystery is slowly being solved

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:15.109 
now the mystery is slowly being solved
here's<00:01:13.830> a<00:01:13.920> little<00:01:14.159> bit<00:01:14.250> of<00:01:14.369> documentation

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:15.119 
here's a little bit of documentation

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:16.370 
here's a little bit of documentation
that<00:01:15.150> they<00:01:15.360> have<00:01:15.450> included<00:01:15.810> for<00:01:15.869> me<00:01:16.110> again

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380 
that they have included for me again

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:18.380 
that they have included for me again
this<00:01:16.500> is<00:01:16.650> a<00:01:16.680> sample<00:01:17.189> so<00:01:17.490> this<00:01:17.880> might<00:01:18.210> not<00:01:18.240> be

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
this is a sample so this might not be

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:20.149 
this is a sample so this might not be
the<00:01:18.509> actual<00:01:19.020> users<00:01:19.409> may<00:01:19.530> know<00:01:19.650> this<00:01:19.770> is<00:01:19.830> just<00:01:20.070> a

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
the actual users may know this is just a

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:21.740 
the actual users may know this is just a
printout<00:01:20.430> they<00:01:20.640> provided<00:01:21.150> but<00:01:21.299> this<00:01:21.450> is<00:01:21.630> the

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
printout they provided but this is the

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:25.130 
printout they provided but this is the
alpha<00:01:22.170> D<00:01:22.740> b6<00:01:23.250> it<00:01:24.030> is<00:01:24.210> a<00:01:24.299> test<00:01:24.600> bed<00:01:24.900> so

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
alpha D b6 it is a test bed so

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:28.070 
alpha D b6 it is a test bed so
essentially<00:01:25.740> it<00:01:25.860> is<00:01:25.979> a<00:01:26.009> computer<00:01:26.970> case<00:01:27.509> but

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080 
essentially it is a computer case but

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:29.660 
essentially it is a computer case but
not<00:01:28.229> the<00:01:28.470> whole<00:01:28.560> case<00:01:28.829> mostly<00:01:29.189> just<00:01:29.400> the<00:01:29.490> test

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
not the whole case mostly just the test

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:33.770 
not the whole case mostly just the test
bed<00:01:30.049> the<00:01:31.049> Alpha<00:01:31.320> DV<00:01:31.560> 6<00:01:31.799> by<00:01:31.979> DIY<00:01:32.430> PC<00:01:32.970> I<00:01:33.150> will<00:01:33.689> go

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780 
bed the Alpha DV 6 by DIY PC I will go

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:35.240 
bed the Alpha DV 6 by DIY PC I will go
over<00:01:33.960> the<00:01:34.170> parts<00:01:34.439> that<00:01:34.530> are<00:01:34.680> included<00:01:34.799> here

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
over the parts that are included here

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:38.480 
over the parts that are included here
you<00:01:35.790> get<00:01:35.909> an<00:01:36.180> acrylic<00:01:36.689> main<00:01:37.320> motherboard<00:01:37.829> tray

function as your power and reset buttons

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:46.100 
function as your power and reset buttons
and<00:02:42.330> then<00:02:42.870> you<00:02:42.930> also<00:02:43.080> get<00:02:43.470> some<00:02:44.190> USB<00:02:44.610> 2.0<00:02:45.270> ports

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:46.110 
and then you also get some USB 2.0 ports

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:47.570 
and then you also get some USB 2.0 ports
here<00:02:46.320> as<00:02:46.470> well<00:02:46.680> as<00:02:46.770> audio<00:02:47.010> ports<00:02:47.310> so<00:02:47.430> you<00:02:47.459> can

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:47.580 
here as well as audio ports so you can

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:49.910 
here as well as audio ports so you can
plug<00:02:47.850> that<00:02:48.000> into<00:02:48.060> your<00:02:48.390> motherboard<00:02:48.810> to<00:02:49.560> test

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:49.920 
plug that into your motherboard to test

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:52.340 
plug that into your motherboard to test
your<00:02:50.100> audio<00:02:50.130> and<00:02:50.610> USB<00:02:50.730> functions<00:02:51.420> I'm<00:02:51.959> going

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:52.350 
your audio and USB functions I'm going

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:53.690 
your audio and USB functions I'm going
to<00:02:52.470> take<00:02:52.620> you<00:02:52.770> guys<00:02:52.890> through<00:02:52.950> the

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:53.700 
to take you guys through the

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:55.670 
to take you guys through the
step-by-step<00:02:54.090> process<00:02:54.330> of<00:02:54.870> assembling<00:02:55.470> this

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:55.680 
step-by-step process of assembling this

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:57.590 
step-by-step process of assembling this
so<00:02:56.250> here<00:02:56.430> is<00:02:56.520> step<00:02:56.760> one<00:02:57.000> in<00:02:57.030> the<00:02:57.239> assembly

00:02:57.590 --> 00:02:57.600 
so here is step one in the assembly

00:02:57.600 --> 00:02:59.420 
so here is step one in the assembly
process<00:02:57.780> and<00:02:58.110> that<00:02:58.380> is<00:02:58.500> to<00:02:58.620> take<00:02:58.830> these<00:02:59.040> side

00:02:59.420 --> 00:02:59.430 
process and that is to take these side

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:01.580 
process and that is to take these side
acrylic<00:02:59.880> panels<00:03:00.239> for<00:03:00.600> your<00:03:00.840> optical<00:03:01.320> drives

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:01.590 
acrylic panels for your optical drives

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:03.440 
acrylic panels for your optical drives
and<00:03:01.890> hard<00:03:02.010> drives<00:03:02.310> mount<00:03:02.880> them<00:03:03.030> to<00:03:03.150> the<00:03:03.239> drives

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:03.450 
and hard drives mount them to the drives

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:04.850 
and hard drives mount them to the drives
themselves<00:03:03.660> so<00:03:04.080> as<00:03:04.170> you<00:03:04.290> can<00:03:04.440> see<00:03:04.590> I've<00:03:04.739> done

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:04.860 
themselves so as you can see I've done

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:06.949 
themselves so as you can see I've done
that<00:03:05.040> here<00:03:05.370> with<00:03:05.550> our<00:03:05.700> optical<00:03:06.120> drive<00:03:06.300> the

00:03:06.949 --> 00:03:06.959 
that here with our optical drive the

00:03:06.959 --> 00:03:08.900 
that here with our optical drive the
hard<00:03:07.320> drive<00:03:07.530> works<00:03:07.920> in<00:03:08.190> just<00:03:08.520> the<00:03:08.670> same<00:03:08.850> way

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:08.910 
hard drive works in just the same way

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:12.800 
hard drive works in just the same way
you<00:03:09.770> mount<00:03:10.770> the<00:03:11.220> side<00:03:12.060> panel<00:03:12.420> to<00:03:12.510> the<00:03:12.540> Drive

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:12.810 
you mount the side panel to the Drive

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:14.780 
you mount the side panel to the Drive
like<00:03:13.050> so<00:03:13.290> that<00:03:13.530> provides<00:03:13.860> support<00:03:14.250> and

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:14.790 
like so that provides support and

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:19.009 
like so that provides support and
rigidity<00:03:15.500> to<00:03:16.500> the<00:03:16.530> side<00:03:16.770> panels<00:03:17.750> there<00:03:18.750> are<00:03:18.989> a

00:03:19.009 --> 00:03:19.019 
rigidity to the side panels there are a

00:03:19.019 --> 00:03:20.930 
rigidity to the side panels there are a
few<00:03:19.410> next<00:03:19.650> steps<00:03:19.950> here<00:03:20.190> with<00:03:20.400> relation<00:03:20.910> to

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:20.940 
few next steps here with relation to

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:23.150 
few next steps here with relation to
your<00:03:21.269> base<00:03:21.510> plate<00:03:21.720> you<00:03:22.620> actually<00:03:22.860> have<00:03:22.950> a<00:03:22.980> few

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:23.160 
your base plate you actually have a few

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:26.449 
your base plate you actually have a few
options<00:03:23.280> here<00:03:23.580> these<00:03:24.209> serve<00:03:25.170> as<00:03:25.530> the<00:03:25.860> feets<00:03:26.130> to

00:03:26.449 --> 00:03:26.459 
options here these serve as the feets to

00:03:26.459 --> 00:03:28.460 
options here these serve as the feets to
keep<00:03:26.700> the<00:03:26.970> board<00:03:27.239> supported<00:03:27.720> you<00:03:27.810> just<00:03:28.019> insert

00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:28.470 
keep the board supported you just insert

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:29.570 
keep the board supported you just insert
them<00:03:28.680> like<00:03:28.830> that<00:03:29.040> and<00:03:29.160> they<00:03:29.220> have<00:03:29.250> a<00:03:29.370> couple

00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:29.580 
them like that and they have a couple

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:32.000 
them like that and they have a couple
screw<00:03:30.360> holes<00:03:30.540> which<00:03:31.080> are<00:03:31.320> on<00:03:31.530> either<00:03:31.650> side<00:03:31.980> so

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:32.010 
screw holes which are on either side so

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:33.590 
screw holes which are on either side so
whichever<00:03:32.549> way<00:03:32.700> you<00:03:32.760> orient<00:03:33.120> them<00:03:33.299> they<00:03:33.450> will

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:33.600 
whichever way you orient them they will

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:35.960 
whichever way you orient them they will
work<00:03:33.750> you<00:03:34.470> can<00:03:34.590> use<00:03:34.739> three<00:03:35.070> of<00:03:35.190> these<00:03:35.310> at<00:03:35.730> these

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:35.970 
work you can use three of these at these

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:38.600 
work you can use three of these at these
three<00:03:36.239> corners<00:03:36.630> and<00:03:36.840> then<00:03:37.110> use<00:03:37.350> your<00:03:37.610> actual

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:38.610 
three corners and then use your actual

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:40.789 
three corners and then use your actual
optical<00:03:39.480> drives<00:03:39.720> and<00:03:39.900> hard<00:03:40.080> drives<00:03:40.290> for<00:03:40.680> the

00:03:40.789 --> 00:03:40.799 
optical drives and hard drives for the
