away when you hear it you can hear the

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:54.439 
away when you hear it you can hear the
distinction<00:00:52.800> it's<00:00:53.190> it's<00:00:53.489> not<00:00:53.760> like<00:00:54.030> a<00:00:54.059> normal

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449

distinction it's it's not like a normal
siren<00:00:55.260> and<00:00:55.440> then<00:00:55.559> so<00:00:55.739> it<00:00:55.860> catches<00:00:56.280> your

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
siren and then so it catches your

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:58.580 
siren and then so it catches your
attention<00:00:56.600> most<00:00:57.600> vehicles<00:00:58.109> these<00:00:58.230> days<00:00:58.440> are

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:58.590 
attention most vehicles these days are

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:00.590 
attention most vehicles these days are
so<00:00:58.800> soundproof<00:00:59.340> making<00:00:59.940> it<00:01:00.030> hard<00:01:00.300> to<00:01:00.420> hear

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
so soundproof making it hard to hear

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:02.810 
so soundproof making it hard to hear
outside<00:01:00.780> noise<00:01:01.260> and<00:01:01.620> that's<00:01:02.129> a<00:01:02.340> problem<00:01:02.579> for

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
outside noise and that's a problem for

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:05.390 
outside noise and that's a problem for
emergency<00:01:03.570> crews<00:01:03.840> it<00:01:04.530> seems<00:01:04.799> to<00:01:05.070> me<00:01:05.189> that

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400 
emergency crews it seems to me that

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:08.000 
emergency crews it seems to me that
