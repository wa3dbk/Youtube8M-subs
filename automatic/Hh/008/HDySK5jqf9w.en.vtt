working<00:03:09.359> from<00:03:09.840> this<00:03:10.079> high<00:03:10.290> ground<00:03:10.319> ability

00:03:11.059 --> 00:03:11.069 
working from this high ground ability

00:03:11.069 --> 00:03:13.569 
working from this high ground ability
and<00:03:11.280> that<00:03:11.849> was<00:03:12.000> just<00:03:12.150> a<00:03:12.239> brilliant<00:03:12.629> play<00:03:13.260> by

00:03:13.569 --> 00:03:13.579 
and that was just a brilliant play by

00:03:13.579 --> 00:03:16.220 
and that was just a brilliant play by
the<00:03:14.579> Protoss<00:03:15.030> player<00:03:15.269> i<00:03:15.329> think<00:03:15.720> it's<00:03:15.870> saying

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:16.230 
the Protoss player i think it's saying

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:19.580 
the Protoss player i think it's saying
Keanu<00:03:16.620> era<00:03:16.889> I<00:03:17.220> hope<00:03:18.000> it<00:03:18.120> is<00:03:18.239> and<00:03:18.510> yeah<00:03:19.319> that<00:03:19.500> was

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:19.590 
Keanu era I hope it is and yeah that was

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:22.309 
Keanu era I hope it is and yeah that was
just<00:03:19.739> really<00:03:20.040> really<00:03:20.459> strong<00:03:21.060> play<00:03:21.480> but<00:03:22.139> back

00:03:22.309 --> 00:03:22.319 
just really really strong play but back

00:03:22.319 --> 00:03:24.740 
just really really strong play but back
over<00:03:22.620> earlier<00:03:23.609> in<00:03:23.790> the<00:03:23.940> game<00:03:23.970> I<00:03:24.239> believe

00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:24.750 
over earlier in the game I believe

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:26.330 
over earlier in the game I believe
though<00:03:24.900> the<00:03:25.319> Terran<00:03:25.620> did<00:03:25.709> a<00:03:25.769> great<00:03:26.040> job<00:03:26.069> with

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:26.340 
though the Terran did a great job with

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:29.659 
though the Terran did a great job with
that<00:03:26.609> early<00:03:27.209> drop<00:03:27.900> into<00:03:28.260> the<00:03:28.290> base<00:03:28.560> using<00:03:29.430> his

00:03:29.659 --> 00:03:29.669 
that early drop into the base using his

00:03:29.669 --> 00:03:31.610 
that early drop into the base using his
