think it looks pretty good with it it's

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:12.530 
think it looks pretty good with it it's
a<00:02:08.789> good<00:02:08.970> contrast<00:02:09.479> there's<00:02:10.410> the<00:02:10.800> camera

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:12.540 
a good contrast there's the camera

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:15.350 
a good contrast there's the camera
and<00:02:12.659> it<00:02:13.230> does<00:02:13.409> protect<00:02:13.650> it<00:02:14.040> this<00:02:14.610> certain<00:02:15.239> one

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:15.360 
and it does protect it this certain one

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:17.780 
and it does protect it this certain one
who<00:02:15.450> is<00:02:15.510> shining<00:02:16.049> here<00:02:16.079> in<00:02:16.319> mat<00:02:16.650> here<00:02:16.950> it's<00:02:17.700> a

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:17.790 
who is shining here in mat here it's a

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:22.130 
who is shining here in mat here it's a
hard<00:02:18.030> case<00:02:18.299> and<00:02:19.040> it<00:02:20.040> works<00:02:20.480> pretty<00:02:21.480> well<00:02:21.629> I'm

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:22.140 
hard case and it works pretty well I'm

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:24.800 
hard case and it works pretty well I'm
satisfied<00:02:22.799> with<00:02:23.159> the<00:02:23.250> other<00:02:23.370> one<00:02:23.579> so<00:02:24.420> i<00:02:24.450> think

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:24.810 
satisfied with the other one so i think

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:26.390 
satisfied with the other one so i think
it's<00:02:25.049> going<00:02:25.230> to<00:02:25.319> do<00:02:25.409> well<00:02:25.590> in<00:02:25.739> when<00:02:26.069> you<00:02:26.159> put<00:02:26.310> it

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:26.400 
it's going to do well in when you put it

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:29.690 
it's going to do well in when you put it
down<00:02:26.430> it<00:02:26.730> does<00:02:26.879> not<00:02:27.030> allow<00:02:27.780> the<00:02:28.579> screen<00:02:29.579> to

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:29.700 
down it does not allow the screen to

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:32.960 
down it does not allow the screen to
touch<00:02:29.909> so<00:02:30.530> that's<00:02:31.530> good<00:02:31.859> and<00:02:32.159> it<00:02:32.609> gives<00:02:32.730> access
