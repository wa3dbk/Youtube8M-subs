 here in a new video on my channel and 

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:10.559
 well I wanted to explain a little bit because 

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:12.929
 I have already advanced on the subject of 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:15.529
 world classifications I have taken 

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:18.150
 proportions add new classes to me 

00:00:15.529 --> 00:00:19.710
 superclass am and power class that has given 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:21.899
 a lot of nail it true many agents 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:23.729
 I was saying they were super good at 

00:00:21.899 --> 00:00:25.380
 my classes that are taking very 

00:00:23.729 --> 00:00:27.809
 good games are taking out even 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:29.460
 nuclear and one the truth I'm glad 

00:00:27.809 --> 00:00:31.439
 very much that you help and 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:35.460
 failing new classes as they go 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:37.320
 getting updates and good and 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:39.899
 taking soul guides and finally this 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:42.350
 Monday we will continue with the face as h 

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:44.519
 already weapons drought and it 's a series that 

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:46.109
 it was with the one that I started the channel and it was the 

00:00:44.519 --> 00:00:48.660
 that gave me many reproductions when 

00:00:46.109 --> 00:00:51.390
 I had a few subscribers and good 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:53.159
 as the title says here I'm going to teach 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:55.440
 practically a little bit of everything else 

00:00:53.159 --> 00:00:56.730
 time as a video update 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:58.800
 previous of my credit statistics 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:02.339
 development and I'm going to put it as a 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:04.050
 video for unsubscribed users 

00:01:02.339 --> 00:01:07.079
 so I'll probably put in the title 

00:01:04.050 --> 00:01:07.880
 14 of the world because if it is that 14 

00:01:07.079 --> 00:01:10.700
 already here 

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:13.659
 check that it is loaded and I'm in 

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:16.970
 first page as you see prosperin 

00:01:13.659 --> 00:01:19.850
 greeting to utter is that such first 

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:21.979
 I'm talking to him lately and 

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:23.440
 Well I've counted a couple of little things that 

00:01:21.979 --> 00:01:25.750
 I have seen today 

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:27.270
 name end girlfriend I'm just going to 

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:30.840
 put 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:32.909
 I'm going to do well like that for those who 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:35.880
 are the users that are possible 

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:39.060
 hackers the proper inia said one in his 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:40.829
 day and it is proven that he is 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:44.250
 it's not that it's hackers and that it's just 

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:47.270
 he spends hours and hours with his colleague 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:49.340
 catching justi point or busti point 

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:51.649
 in hot spot last team with their 

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:53.679
 colleagues going in and out going in and 

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:53.679
 coming out 

00:01:54.430 --> 00:02:00.820
 here another 

00:01:56.600 --> 00:02:02.530
 here another one to ebay that print good 

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:04.990
 I spoke with Prosperi he said yes 

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:08.200
 that his account but he told me that the 

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:10.690
 has not for fucking those of us who are more 

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:13.310
 below but because it says it looks in 

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:15.590
 danger that they can 

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:20.390
 hack your account your main account is 

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:23.000
 and he says he looks dangerous because of that 

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:24.489
 The account of stars doubled 

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:27.260
 it seems that they have allowed it 

00:02:24.489 --> 00:02:29.569
 within what fits and is in the room or 

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:31.910
 be that if some day to prosperi I died 

00:02:29.569 --> 00:02:34.280
 will be after maquis with it that will rise 

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:36.709
 to point and all that so of all 

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:40.120
 task ways third although I would know 

00:02:36.709 --> 00:02:44.120
 that right now the best in public 

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:47.140
 here another user also supposed 

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:49.720
 hacker other 

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:54.480
 other 

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:56.780
 and another so it would be 13 

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:59.170
 12 

00:02:56.780 --> 00:03:01.330
 of 11 10 

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:02.830
 9 and 8 as you are seeing I would be the 

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:04.720
 put 8 so he would enter between what 

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:07.630
 First of all, in what way do you 

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:09.970
 those people and well I have nothing more to say 

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:11.380
 we already see start teaching in my good 

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:18.940
 deals that I forget well I do 

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:21.970
 rapidite 182 158 500 08 232 thousand casualties 

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:23.800
 122 unstoppable 11 chains of casualties in the 

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:26.370
 necessary proportions departÃ­an and 

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:30.480
 keep the cable lately 

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:32.730
 This teaches us the 31 Clares 

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:36.269
 I'm taking nuclear in japan in acts 

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:37.500
 or near the lows 11 a works like 

00:03:36.269 --> 00:03:39.560
 I'm already looking to take advantage of the time in 

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:43.250
 ataun 

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:46.010
 a little inferior tactics in 

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:50.239
 demolition are used a lot so how about 

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:52.040
 you took the first page that you're 

00:03:50.239 --> 00:03:53.840
 seeing that I teach it fast because as 

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:55.640
 that's the same thing he just used 

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:57.019
 guagua contraespionaje and obesa for 

00:03:55.640 --> 00:04:00.560
 get more tips out the classification 

00:03:57.019 --> 00:04:02.330
 global and here power class and this one already 

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:04.290
 was this one was already latin 

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:06.030
 random for 

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:07.530
 this class so with the advantages for 

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:09.719
 super good but I have it for not 

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:12.090
 I know what to put it on corp jon the boy does not 

00:04:09.719 --> 00:04:14.700
 the scale one of those three to put it 

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:17.070
 and clicking here I saw mmc but it's 

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:18.840
 changed because I put hard line 

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:20.880
 because they updated the patch and now 

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:22.320
 they have come down now the streak is out more 

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:24.570
 easily with hard line even more 

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:26.729
 easy so very cool hard line 

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:28.410
 I recommend this class to get a streak 

00:04:26.729 --> 00:04:31.650
 in hunger plan is the one of these companies 

00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:33.479
 for no mcm zetas the mythical much 

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:36.960
 people have told me that it is amazing and 

00:04:33.479 --> 00:04:39.800
 above all, it's incredible 

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:43.199
 here added the pinch although I put 

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:44.850
 also how is uruguay going 

00:04:43.199 --> 00:04:46.199
 It's good, it was a little better 

00:04:44.850 --> 00:04:48.810
 true but it 's great distances is 

00:04:46.199 --> 00:04:50.490
 amazing here it puts mp7 but it puts 

00:04:48.810 --> 00:04:52.229
 shotgun because I was already pulling 

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:55.410
 nuclear with the goal and already feel the 

00:04:52.229 --> 00:04:57.270
 removed from the medium was very good about 

00:04:55.410 --> 00:05:00.030
 all innate on the short map the 

00:04:57.270 --> 00:05:01.259
 warm tepid warm tbc stoppers pointed at 

00:05:00.030 --> 00:05:03.300
 medium and the built-in wants to take me out 

00:05:01.259 --> 00:05:05.280
 a plate with the m8 since not yet not 

00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:07.710
 he has done it so I want to 

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:10.020
 Doing the same skirt did not do it 

00:05:07.710 --> 00:05:11.280
 not done the warren class playing 

00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:13.530
 in production I say it in 

00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:15.990
 demolition a game like a pig 

00:05:13.530 --> 00:05:20.370
 no problem at least I admit the 

00:05:15.990 --> 00:05:22.740
 things not like a garden I do not know that I 

00:05:20.370 --> 00:05:23.580
 the other I say it I play demolition 

00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:26.789
 like a pig 

00:05:23.580 --> 00:05:29.940
 in natanz and did not let them leave the 

00:05:26.789 --> 00:05:32.070
 answer and point is worth 

00:05:29.940 --> 00:05:34.020
 there is no problem in it although much 

00:05:32.070 --> 00:05:35.580
 feel like you're a good pig if I'm a 

00:05:34.020 --> 00:05:39.600
 pig is already played medicine and 

00:05:35.580 --> 00:05:42.090
 pencil sharpener and I get gusts and others 

00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:44.550
 in gameplay not play well worth it 

00:05:42.090 --> 00:05:46.230
 be clear and good as you are seeing 

00:05:44.550 --> 00:05:48.840
 here this has been all trailer for 

00:05:46.230 --> 00:05:52.610
