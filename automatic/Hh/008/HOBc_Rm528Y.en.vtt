performed better on tests because the

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:54.700 
performed better on tests because the
dye<00:02:53.690> that<00:02:53.720> when<00:02:54.170> they<00:02:54.290> knew<00:02:54.320> they<00:02:54.650> were

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:00.230 
more careful they were more they were

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:01.780 
more careful they were more they were
thinking<00:03:00.650> more<00:03:00.830> critically<00:03:01.100> than<00:03:01.640> they

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:01.790 
thinking more critically than they

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:02.710 
thinking more critically than they
normally<00:03:02.090> would

00:03:02.710 --> 00:03:02.720 
normally would

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:05.110 
normally would
so<00:03:03.080> again<00:03:03.350> dressed<00:03:04.160> like<00:03:04.310> a<00:03:04.340> gentleman<00:03:04.640> you'll
