this weekend so they come with the track

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:23.009 
this weekend so they come with the track
which<00:00:21.699> is<00:00:21.730> super<00:00:22.210> simple<00:00:22.390> to<00:00:22.720> put<00:00:22.900> together

00:00:23.009 --> 00:00:23.019 
which is super simple to put together

00:00:23.019 --> 00:00:26.249 
which is super simple to put together
have<00:00:23.800> you<00:00:23.830> ever<00:00:24.099> put<00:00:24.369> her<00:00:24.759> train<00:00:25.390> track<00:00:25.660> kids

00:00:26.249 --> 00:00:26.259 
have you ever put her train track kids

00:00:26.259 --> 00:00:28.560 
have you ever put her train track kids
for<00:00:26.859> something<00:00:27.189> like<00:00:27.369> that<00:00:27.550> um<00:00:28.089> it's<00:00:28.539> very

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:28.570 
for something like that um it's very

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:31.620 
for something like that um it's very
simple<00:00:29.289> so<00:00:29.830> they<00:00:29.980> just<00:00:30.220> lock<00:00:30.640> in<00:00:30.939> together<00:00:31.179> and

00:00:31.620 --> 00:00:31.630 
simple so they just lock in together and

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:34.200 
simple so they just lock in together and
then<00:00:32.140> here<00:00:32.410> for<00:00:32.650> the<00:00:32.740> base<00:00:32.950> to<00:00:33.640> balance<00:00:34.030> on

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:34.210 
then here for the base to balance on

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:34.860 
then here for the base to balance on
your<00:00:34.239> table

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:34.870 
your table

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:36.600 
your table
are<00:00:35.170> these<00:00:35.289> little<00:00:35.530> legs<00:00:35.829> and<00:00:36.280> there's<00:00:36.520> a

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:36.610 
are these little legs and there's a

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:39.180 
are these little legs and there's a
little<00:00:36.820> flat<00:00:37.300> part<00:00:37.570> the<00:00:38.079> edge<00:00:38.200> you<00:00:38.829> want<00:00:38.950> that

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:39.190 
little flat part the edge you want that

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:41.760 
little flat part the edge you want that
to<00:00:39.370> be<00:00:39.460> out<00:00:39.760> towards<00:00:40.570> your<00:00:40.719> fingers<00:00:41.230> cuz

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:41.770 
to be out towards your fingers cuz

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:43.870 
that'll help it to balance more so

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:45.959 
that'll help it to balance more so
there's<00:00:44.140> three<00:00:44.440> sets<00:00:44.770> of<00:00:44.890> those<00:00:45.100> that<00:00:45.850> you
