00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:11.549
 we do not all know to dismantle the 

00:00:08.969 --> 00:00:14.820
 crankshaft you have to remove the trimmings 

00:00:11.549 --> 00:00:18.539
 of bench but before removing them is 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:19.800
 advisable to mark them with great eta 21 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:22.919
 for which we are stuck to the 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:25.740
 distribution 2 for the next 3 and so 

00:00:22.919 --> 00:00:28.199
 successively it would also be necessary 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:30.960
 mark with an arrow miranda the 

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:33.949
 distribution in case it was not 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:33.949
 already marked by the manufacturer 

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:40.330
 to verify the axial play of the 

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:42.100
 crankshaft we will use a watch 

00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:45.610
 Comparator supported on a surface 

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:49.150
 flat and with his palpate resting on the 

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:51.520
 Inertia flywheel is advisable to do 

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:54.210
 lever instead of hitting with a 

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:58.320
 hammer analyze for example 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:01:00.840
 so we will leverage and with the 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:04.470
 variation that the comparator clock gives us 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:07.790
 then we will verify the axial game that 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:07.790
 has the crankshaft 

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:15.790
 to measure the home regretted that the 

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:20.229
 bench supports we place a crankshaft 

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:22.330
 on two supports on a frame with the 

00:01:20.229 --> 00:01:23.840
 help of a comparator watch we will go 

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:25.490
 measuring 

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:26.620
 the information that has the support of 

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:29.760
 bedplate 

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:29.760
 we are turning 

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:41.800
 as you see 

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:45.480
 it's not worn out because the needle 

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:45.480
 remains motionless at zero 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:55.080
 to check the finger bread is court 

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:58.440
 of operations practically the same as 

00:01:55.080 --> 00:02:01.290
 to measure the new health food that 

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:04.860
 in this case we will perform the measurement 

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:07.770
 with the support of central bench before 

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:12.140
 video so we can check if the 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:12.140
 crankshaft has tambourine
