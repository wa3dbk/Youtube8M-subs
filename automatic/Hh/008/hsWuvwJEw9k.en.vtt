got the tiles and then you've got a

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:35.260 
got the tiles and then you've got a
point<00:00:32.130> right<00:00:33.090> here<00:00:33.500> if<00:00:34.500> you<00:00:34.559> can<00:00:34.710> see<00:00:34.739> my<00:00:35.010> mouse

point right here if you can see my mouse

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:38.709 
point right here if you can see my mouse
between<00:00:36.270> these<00:00:36.450> tile<00:00:36.719> borders<00:00:37.170> that<00:00:37.980> doesn't

00:00:38.709 --> 00:00:38.719 
between these tile borders that doesn't

00:00:38.719 --> 00:00:41.240 
between these tile borders that doesn't
that's<00:00:39.719> the<00:00:39.989> actual<00:00:40.590> point<00:00:40.890> that<00:00:41.100> you're

digging will be a cart I've got hey I'm

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:00.470 
digging will be a cart I've got hey I'm
dragging<00:00:57.809> behind<00:00:57.930> me<00:00:58.260> a<00:00:58.289> large<00:00:58.770> cart<00:00:59.239> can<00:01:00.239> hold

dragging behind me a large cart can hold
up<00:01:00.719> to<00:01:00.750> 100<00:01:01.140> dirt<00:01:01.320> I<00:01:01.500> believe<00:01:01.940> so<00:01:02.940> anyway

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719 
up to 100 dirt I believe so anyway

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:06.080 
up to 100 dirt I believe so anyway
you've<00:01:04.470> got<00:01:04.650> four<00:01:04.890> tiles<00:01:05.129> in<00:01:05.489> there<00:01:05.640> all<00:01:05.790> flat

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
you've got four tiles in there all flat

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:10.880 
you've got four tiles in there all flat
as<00:01:06.270> you<00:01:06.299> can<00:01:06.570> see<00:01:06.780> by<00:01:07.049> the<00:01:07.490> mouse<00:01:08.490> over<00:01:09.200> on<00:01:10.200> the

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
as you can see by the mouse over on the

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:13.070 
as you can see by the mouse over on the
tiles<00:01:11.130> themselves<00:01:11.820> the<00:01:12.119> borders<00:01:12.450> you<00:01:12.510> flat<00:01:12.780> so

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080 
tiles themselves the borders you flat so

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:16.609 
tiles themselves the borders you flat so
let's<00:01:13.350> start<00:01:14.159> now<00:01:14.630> think<00:01:15.630> of<00:01:15.750> it<00:01:15.810> as<00:01:15.930> a<00:01:15.990> piece

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
let's start now think of it as a piece

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:20.810 
let's start now think of it as a piece
of<00:01:16.650> graph<00:01:17.009> paper<00:01:17.720> every<00:01:18.720> place<00:01:19.100> where<00:01:20.100> lines

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
of graph paper every place where lines

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:23.300 
of graph paper every place where lines
intersect<00:01:21.479> is<00:01:21.720> a<00:01:21.780> point<00:01:22.170> that<00:01:22.409> point<00:01:23.070> can

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
intersect is a point that point can

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:26.899 
intersect is a point that point can
raise<00:01:23.670> or<00:01:24.270> be<00:01:24.659> lowered<00:01:25.080> and<00:01:25.640> that's<00:01:26.640> just<00:01:26.850> a

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:26.909 
raise or be lowered and that's just a

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:30.469 
raise or be lowered and that's just a
simple<00:01:27.240> dig<00:01:27.509> so<00:01:28.189> you<00:01:29.189> just<00:01:29.220> walk<00:01:30.119> to<00:01:30.360> the

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 
simple dig so you just walk to the

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:33.560 
simple dig so you just walk to the
corner<00:01:30.890> or<00:01:31.890> the<00:01:31.920> point<00:01:32.310> somewhere<00:01:33.299> in<00:01:33.450> this

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570 
corner or the point somewhere in this

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:37.490 
corner or the point somewhere in this
area<00:01:33.810> if<00:01:34.229> you<00:01:34.530> think<00:01:34.890> about<00:01:35.240> this<00:01:36.240> tile<00:01:36.750> being

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:37.500 
area if you think about this tile being

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:40.819 
area if you think about this tile being
divided<00:01:38.070> into<00:01:38.520> fours<00:01:38.820> if<00:01:39.210> you<00:01:39.810> if<00:01:40.110> I<00:01:40.290> stand<00:01:40.590> on

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:40.829 
divided into fours if you if I stand on

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:43.940 
divided into fours if you if I stand on
this<00:01:41.340> corner<00:01:42.060> right<00:01:42.329> here<00:01:42.390> I'm<00:01:43.049> lowering<00:01:43.649> this

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950 
this corner right here I'm lowering this

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:45.859 
this corner right here I'm lowering this
point<00:01:44.280> but<00:01:44.729> if<00:01:44.820> I<00:01:44.939> were<00:01:45.060> to<00:01:45.149> walk<00:01:45.240> over<00:01:45.570> here

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:45.869 
point but if I were to walk over here

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:48.289 
point but if I were to walk over here
and<00:01:46.049> stand<00:01:46.259> in<00:01:46.590> anywhere<00:01:47.430> in<00:01:47.549> this<00:01:47.729> corner<00:01:48.119> I'm

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:48.299 
and stand in anywhere in this corner I'm

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:51.679 
and stand in anywhere in this corner I'm
dropping<00:01:49.229> that<00:01:49.860> point<00:01:50.280> over<00:01:50.430> there<00:01:50.549> but<00:01:51.450> for

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:51.689 
dropping that point over there but for

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:53.539

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:32.250 
see the slope and the slope is going

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:35.690 
see the slope and the slope is going
down<00:02:32.730> one<00:02:33.540> dirt<00:02:33.870> every<00:02:34.860> time<00:02:35.040> just<00:02:35.430> think<00:02:35.610> of

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:35.700 
down one dirt every time just think of

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:38.030 
down one dirt every time just think of
that's<00:02:35.850> like<00:02:36.090> one<00:02:36.330> point<00:02:36.690> on<00:02:36.900> the<00:02:37.020> x-axis<00:02:37.500> as

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:38.040 
that's like one point on the x-axis as

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:42.680 
that's like one point on the x-axis as
we're<00:02:38.280> going<00:02:38.460> up<00:02:38.700> and<00:02:39.270> down<00:02:39.360> and<00:02:41.510> we've<00:02:42.510> got

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:42.690 
we're going up and down and we've got

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:45.650 
we're going up and down and we've got
four<00:02:42.990> dirt<00:02:43.460> go<00:02:44.460> ahead<00:02:44.700> and<00:02:44.850> go<00:02:44.970> one<00:02:45.150> more<00:02:45.330> so<00:02:45.540> or

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:45.660 
four dirt go ahead and go one more so or

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:52.540 
four dirt go ahead and go one more so or
five<00:02:45.930> and<00:02:48.710> it<00:02:49.710> won't<00:02:50.040> look<00:02:50.190> like<00:02:50.250> a<00:02:50.430> whole<00:02:50.670> lot

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:52.550 
five and it won't look like a whole lot

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:56.920 
five and it won't look like a whole lot
but<00:02:53.550> that's<00:02:53.850> why<00:02:54.410> bring<00:02:55.410> up<00:02:55.500> the<00:02:55.620> inventory

I started so now if this is flat we can

00:05:19.430 --> 00:05:21.240 
I started so now if this is flat we can
keep<00:05:19.580> going<00:05:19.640> so<00:05:20.300> I'll<00:05:20.360> take<00:05:20.540> these<00:05:20.660> other<00:05:20.870> five

keep going so I'll take these other five
drop<00:05:22.250> them<00:05:22.460> find<00:05:22.790> the<00:05:22.910> corner<00:05:23.240> which<00:05:23.479> I'm

00:05:23.650 --> 00:05:23.660 
drop them find the corner which I'm

00:05:23.660 --> 00:05:28.150 
drop them find the corner which I'm
standing<00:05:23.960> in<00:05:24.820> drop<00:05:25.820> it<00:05:26.470> back<00:05:27.470> up<00:05:27.740> a<00:05:27.860> little<00:05:27.979> bit

00:05:28.150 --> 00:05:28.160 
standing in drop it back up a little bit

00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:30.640 
standing in drop it back up a little bit
so<00:05:28.310> you<00:05:28.370> can<00:05:28.430> see<00:05:28.840> wait<00:05:29.840> to<00:05:29.990> the<00:05:30.110> cart<00:05:30.320> it's<00:05:30.500> all

00:05:30.640 --> 00:05:30.650 
so you can see wait to the cart it's all

00:05:30.650 --> 00:05:35.200 
so you can see wait to the cart it's all
the<00:05:30.740> way<00:05:30.830> and<00:05:32.740> now<00:05:33.740> you<00:05:33.800> see<00:05:34.220> this<00:05:34.850> they're

00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:35.210 
the way and now you see this they're

00:05:35.210 --> 00:05:37.120 
the way and now you see this they're
sloped<00:05:35.479> up<00:05:35.720> a<00:05:35.840> little<00:05:36.050> bit<00:05:36.200> so<00:05:36.830> each

00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:37.130 
sloped up a little bit so each

00:05:37.130 --> 00:05:39.400 
sloped up a little bit so each
individual<00:05:37.970> point<00:05:38.270> on<00:05:38.479> the<00:05:38.720> graph<00:05:38.870> can<00:05:39.380> be

00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:39.410 
individual point on the graph can be

00:05:39.410 --> 00:05:42.280 
individual point on the graph can be
raised<00:05:39.740> and<00:05:40.040> lowered<00:05:40.479> its<00:05:41.479> it's<00:05:41.930> a

00:05:42.280 --> 00:05:42.290 
raised and lowered its it's a

00:05:42.290 --> 00:05:44.800 
raised and lowered its it's a
complicated<00:05:42.950> concept<00:05:43.310> at<00:05:43.940> first<00:05:44.390> but<00:05:44.630> once

00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:44.810 
complicated concept at first but once

00:05:44.810 --> 00:05:47.110 
complicated concept at first but once
you<00:05:44.960> get<00:05:45.050> the<00:05:45.140> hang<00:05:45.169> of<00:05:45.470> it<00:05:45.590> it's<00:05:46.340> a<00:05:46.520> it's

00:05:47.110 --> 00:05:47.120 
you get the hang of it it's a it's

00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:49.270 
you get the hang of it it's a it's
pretty<00:05:47.479> simple<00:05:47.750> actually<00:05:47.990> and<00:05:48.470> then<00:05:48.770> just<00:05:49.100> to

00:05:49.270 --> 00:05:49.280 
pretty simple actually and then just to

00:05:49.280 --> 00:05:51.490 
pretty simple actually and then just to
make<00:05:49.430> it<00:05:49.460> nicer<00:05:50.000> and<00:05:50.180> prettier<00:05:50.419> and<00:05:50.780> one<00:05:51.320> more

00:05:51.490 --> 00:05:51.500 
make it nicer and prettier and one more

00:05:51.500 --> 00:05:53.560 
make it nicer and prettier and one more
little<00:05:51.710> tip<00:05:51.950> while<00:05:52.520> it's<00:05:52.760> dirt<00:05:53.030> it<00:05:53.300> has<00:05:53.540> a

00:05:53.560 --> 00:05:53.570 
little tip while it's dirt it has a

00:05:53.570 --> 00:05:56.020 
little tip while it's dirt it has a
chance<00:05:53.900> to<00:05:54.110> grow<00:05:54.229> back<00:05:54.500> as<00:05:54.710> grass<00:05:55.040> like<00:05:55.700> this

00:05:56.020 --> 00:05:56.030 
chance to grow back as grass like this

00:05:56.030 --> 00:05:58.210 
chance to grow back as grass like this
much<00:05:56.720> quicker<00:05:56.990> now<00:05:57.350> the<00:05:57.410> guy<00:05:57.710> who<00:05:57.770> was<00:05:58.040> over

00:05:58.210 --> 00:05:58.220 
much quicker now the guy who was over

00:05:58.220 --> 00:06:00.040 
much quicker now the guy who was over
here<00:05:58.370> this<00:05:58.490> is<00:05:58.610> an<00:05:58.700> unneeded<00:05:58.970> piece<00:05:59.360> ever<00:05:59.900> buy

00:06:00.040 --> 00:06:00.050 
here this is an unneeded piece ever buy

00:06:00.050 --> 00:06:03.700 
here this is an unneeded piece ever buy
my<00:06:00.260> land<00:06:00.820> he<00:06:01.820> dug<00:06:02.030> this<00:06:02.240> down<00:06:02.479> and<00:06:02.810> this<00:06:03.200> patch

00:06:03.700 --> 00:06:03.710 
my land he dug this down and this patch

00:06:03.710 --> 00:06:07.870 
my land he dug this down and this patch
has<00:06:03.950> already<00:06:04.130> grown<00:06:04.340> back<00:06:04.640> his<00:06:04.850> grass<00:06:05.120> so<00:06:06.880> this

00:06:07.870 --> 00:06:07.880 
has already grown back his grass so this

00:06:07.880 --> 00:06:10.360 
has already grown back his grass so this
will<00:06:08.410> has<00:06:09.410> a<00:06:09.440> potential<00:06:09.919> to<00:06:09.950> come<00:06:10.100> back<00:06:10.220> his

00:06:10.360 --> 00:06:10.370 
will has a potential to come back his

00:06:10.370 --> 00:06:11.920 
will has a potential to come back his
grass<00:06:10.580> much<00:06:10.820> quicker<00:06:11.030> but<00:06:11.300> if<00:06:11.479> you<00:06:11.600> do<00:06:11.720> a<00:06:11.750> right

started the video and now it's a nice
packed<00:06:23.100> piece<00:06:23.370> of<00:06:23.520> land<00:06:23.730> that<00:06:23.940> you<00:06:24.060> can<00:06:24.210> build

00:06:24.500 --> 00:06:24.510 
packed piece of land that you can build

00:06:24.510 --> 00:06:27.740 
packed piece of land that you can build
like<00:06:24.690> a<00:06:24.720> little<00:06:24.960> temporary<00:06:25.200> Road<00:06:26.570> we'll<00:06:27.570> get

00:06:27.740 --> 00:06:27.750 
like a little temporary Road we'll get

00:06:27.750 --> 00:06:29.180 
like a little temporary Road we'll get
into<00:06:27.930> laying<00:06:28.380> bricks<00:06:28.650> and<00:06:28.800> everything<00:06:29.070> you

00:06:29.180 --> 00:06:29.190

make road out of this pack dirt and and
all<00:06:31.410> that<00:06:31.440> so<00:06:31.980> that's<00:06:32.970> just<00:06:33.060> real<00:06:33.390> quickly<00:06:33.720> the

00:06:34.340 --> 00:06:34.350 
all that so that's just real quickly the
