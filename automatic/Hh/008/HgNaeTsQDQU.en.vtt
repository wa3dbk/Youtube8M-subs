even just eat them on their own and also

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.150 
even just eat them on their own and also
if<00:02:24.090> it<00:02:24.210> starts<00:02:24.480> to<00:02:24.570> get<00:02:24.690> close<00:02:24.960> to<00:02:25.170> the<00:02:25.320> use<00:02:25.860> by

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:26.160 
if it starts to get close to the use by

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:28.460 
if it starts to get close to the use by
date<00:02:26.190> and<00:02:26.760> I<00:02:26.940> still<00:02:27.300> have<00:02:27.450> quite<00:02:28.020> a<00:02:28.080> bit<00:02:28.290> left

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:28.470 
date and I still have quite a bit left

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:30.260

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:30.270 
i'll just put it in a freezer bag and

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:31.940 
i'll just put it in a freezer bag and
store<00:02:30.510> it<00:02:30.660> in<00:02:30.690> the<00:02:30.810> freezer<00:02:31.020> and<00:02:31.350> then

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:31.950 
store it in the freezer and then

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:33.770 
store it in the freezer and then
obviously<00:02:32.550> you<00:02:32.970> can<00:02:33.090> still<00:02:33.300> use<00:02:33.330> it<00:02:33.600> that<00:02:33.750> way

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:33.780

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:09.090 
I also got this organic ground beef this

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:14.330 
I also got this organic ground beef this
is<00:03:10.310> 31.3<00:03:11.310> for<00:03:11.820> pound<00:03:12.590> packages<00:03:13.590> and<00:03:13.920> i<00:03:14.190> will

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:14.340 
is 31.3 for pound packages and i will

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:17.990 
is 31.3 for pound packages and i will
probably<00:03:14.580> split<00:03:15.209> these<00:03:15.450> into<00:03:15.510> two<00:03:16.520> bags<00:03:17.520> each

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:18.000 
probably split these into two bags each

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.600 
probably split these into two bags each
before<00:03:18.330> I<00:03:18.510> freeze<00:03:18.840> them<00:03:19.110> just<00:03:19.380> because<00:03:19.610> we

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:20.610 
before I freeze them just because we

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:23.150 
before I freeze them just because we
don't<00:03:20.760> need<00:03:20.970> a<00:03:21.000> whole<00:03:21.410> you<00:03:22.410> know<00:03:22.530> more<00:03:22.890> than<00:03:23.070> a

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:23.160 
don't need a whole you know more than a

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:25.880 
don't need a whole you know more than a
pound<00:03:23.340> for<00:03:23.790> a<00:03:23.850> single<00:03:24.360> meal<00:03:24.600> so<00:03:25.080> I'll<00:03:25.680> probably

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:25.890 
pound for a single meal so I'll probably

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:27.260 
pound for a single meal so I'll probably
separate<00:03:26.310> them<00:03:26.489> out<00:03:26.580> and<00:03:26.760> just<00:03:26.880> make<00:03:27.090> it<00:03:27.120> a

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:27.270 
separate them out and just make it a

00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:28.910 
separate them out and just make it a
little<00:03:27.390> more<00:03:27.510> convenient<00:03:28.020> for<00:03:28.200> when<00:03:28.470> we<00:03:28.620> do

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:28.920 
little more convenient for when we do

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:30.350 
little more convenient for when we do
need<00:03:29.190> to<00:03:29.220> take<00:03:29.430> them<00:03:29.580> out<00:03:29.670> of<00:03:29.700> the<00:03:29.820> freezer<00:03:29.880> I

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:30.360 
need to take them out of the freezer I

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:32.960 
need to take them out of the freezer I
also<00:03:30.630> got<00:03:30.900> this<00:03:30.930> bag<00:03:31.350> of<00:03:31.650> romaine<00:03:32.280> hearts<00:03:32.520> just

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:32.970 
also got this bag of romaine hearts just

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:35.540 
also got this bag of romaine hearts just

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:35.550 
because I think there are 2 99 at costco

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:37.729 
because I think there are 2 99 at costco
and<00:03:35.760> I<00:03:36.030> always<00:03:36.360> get<00:03:36.750> my<00:03:36.930> romaine<00:03:37.290> from<00:03:37.560> there

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:17.320 
sure what kind they are but like the

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:18.780 
sure what kind they are but like the
green<00:04:17.530> ones<00:04:17.739> are<00:04:17.890> more<00:04:18.070> tart<00:04:18.370> and<00:04:18.550> the<00:04:18.640> red

00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:18.790 
green ones are more tart and the red

00:04:18.790 --> 00:04:20.130 
green ones are more tart and the red
ones<00:04:18.970> are<00:04:19.060> more<00:04:19.239> sweet<00:04:19.570> which<00:04:19.810> you<00:04:19.989> would

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:20.140 
ones are more sweet which you would

00:04:20.140 --> 00:04:22.320 
ones are more sweet which you would
expect<00:04:20.170> but<00:04:20.890> it's<00:04:21.370> really<00:04:21.670> nice<00:04:21.880> to<00:04:21.940> have<00:04:22.150> them

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:22.330 
expect but it's really nice to have them

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:23.760 
expect but it's really nice to have them
in<00:04:22.420> the<00:04:22.540> same<00:04:22.720> bag<00:04:22.960> because<00:04:23.170> you<00:04:23.320> kind<00:04:23.530> of<00:04:23.590> get

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:23.770 
in the same bag because you kind of get

00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:27.540 
in the same bag because you kind of get
a<00:04:23.950> good<00:04:24.280> mixture<00:04:24.970> of<00:04:25.300> flavors<00:04:25.930> and<00:04:26.410> I<00:04:27.310> think

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:27.550 
a good mixture of flavors and I think

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:29.910 
a good mixture of flavors and I think
these<00:04:27.670> are<00:04:27.730> like<00:04:28.060> 699<00:04:28.900> or<00:04:29.260> something<00:04:29.590> it<00:04:29.740> seems

00:04:29.910 --> 00:04:29.920 
these are like 699 or something it seems

00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:32.280 
these are like 699 or something it seems
like<00:04:30.220> a<00:04:30.250> pretty<00:04:30.790> ridiculous<00:04:31.450> price<00:04:31.750> for<00:04:32.020> a<00:04:32.050> bag

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:32.290 
like a pretty ridiculous price for a bag

00:04:32.290 --> 00:04:35.460 
like a pretty ridiculous price for a bag
of<00:04:32.320> like<00:04:33.270> you<00:04:34.270> know<00:04:34.300> like<00:04:34.420> a<00:04:34.540> snack<00:04:34.990> bag<00:04:35.260> but
