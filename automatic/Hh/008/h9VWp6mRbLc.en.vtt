 then also a cover of the limited 

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:39.239
 edition then let's see why we start 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:41.129
 from the collector's edition they show themselves 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:44.129
 all the contents the box is 

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:46.890
 quite simple with the vigil logo 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:49.110
 thq games and death naturally in 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:51.780
 cover here you can already see the 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:56.910
 death mask does not do enough 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:59.850
 beautiful an interesting collector's at 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:05.939
 inside we have the game 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:09.570
 naturally see consume has read i 

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:12.060
 downloadable codes nothing special 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:15.060
 in this case doing the pre order that 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:15.570
 the steel cover was also available 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:17.640
 box 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:20.850
 as you can also see very much 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:25.880
 pretty really well made too 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:29.340
 inside with the writing in relief 

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:34.079
 in the canine mind then we have the album 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:35.880
 of darksiders ii chronicle artwork that 

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:41.180
 obviously collects a bit of artwork 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:44.310
 of the game as usual the various enemies 

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:45.880
 that we're going to face and of course 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:50.450
 death 

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:53.900
 in the first parts also the allies 

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:57.820
 the horse despar and so on 

00:01:53.900 --> 00:02:01.270
 the interesting part that surely there 

00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:06.850
 because it knows more than anything is the mask 

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:06.850
 the mask of death here it is 

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:12.350
 the material is quite light and 

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:15.590
 hard plastic with this bone effect but 

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:18.140
 naturally and plastic is made 

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:22.310
 quite well I have to say a lot 

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:25.250
 nice here we have the stand in 

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:26.650
 plastic has obviously made in 

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:30.310
 you never know china 

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:33.800
 darksiders ii here we go to thread 

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:35.810
 this deal is up to commit on 

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:37.790
 stand the mask not whining because there 

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:39.470
 I say that you can't do it by putting it on 

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:41.780
 practically more to remove it while 

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:45.860
 Meanwhile, what I would still holding a 

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:49.630
 moment in the box for this unboxing 

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:53.950
 I would say that we see everything with the review 

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:53.950
 gamescollection.it and hello to all
