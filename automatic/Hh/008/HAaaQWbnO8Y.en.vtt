00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
 it is one of the most of you 

00:00:01.290 --> 00:00:04.529
 desired video topics I get 

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.600
 Every week many mails in which 

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:08.790
 mirko stands what do you think about it 

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:10.530
 our school system my opinion 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:12.599
 I like to tell you this now 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:14.730
 video for a really short one 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:22.980
 biasing the record recently but as short 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:24.359
 I was never intro before I was the same 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:25.680
 My opinion says I want a thing 

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:27.539
 really get rid of me very much 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:28.859
 important in this topic is no matter what 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:30.869
 I say here now and no matter how much 

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:33.090
 I complain that everything is complaining 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:35.160
 extremely high level in germany 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:37.170
 or generally in europe are absolute 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:39.030
 spoiled what the school system in 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:40.500
 Africa for example in Kenya where one 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:41.600
 friend of mine can live there 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:43.590
 students only up to a certain 

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:45.360
 class level for free the school 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:45.899
 visit and from then it costs right 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:47.820
 lot of money 

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:48.989
 Poor people can not put their children in 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:50.160
 send the school and the children 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:52.260
 therefore have to be very young 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:53.640
 years the kids want to work 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:55.170
 absolutely go to school that 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:57.000
 he does not care about her school system 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:58.949
 want to learn what you want in yourself 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.480
 They want to absorb what they want 

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:02.399
 learn to do a good job later 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:02.850
 and that just is not possible in many 

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:04.409
 countries 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:06.750
 I know always says so easy but 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:07.950
 we have to be really happy about that 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:09.450
 What we have 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:11.310
 which does not mean that you can not do it 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:12.510
 may criticize anyway and would like 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:14.780
 I'm doing German here now 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:16.799
 school system makes us really stupid 

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:18.509
 question mark no that makes it natural 

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:20.549
 It would not be too bad if she were 

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:23.460
 But the school system at least makes us 

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:25.290
 in places to be professional 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:26.939
 they just write down what they do 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:28.380
 said and then in the 

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:29.909
 Write a note and a good note 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:31.530
 get when you guest one to one 

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:33.180
 what the teacher teaches them 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:34.500
 said or what is in the book is 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:36.170
 Of course, always so and there are fans 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:38.369
 that may be good, too 

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:40.049
 basically, I think is ours 

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:42.329
 school system too much 

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:45.149
 geared to a specific plan 

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:47.220
 to be able to learn specific topics 

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:49.049
 stand on this plan and these topics 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:51.000
 then so that the teacher on 

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:52.439
 end is satisfied what much instead 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.299
 is made too rare is on the 

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:57.000
 gift of a student watching 

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:59.280
 example I was in front to back in 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.960
 the school bad in math I was g9 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:03.659
 So students until the 13th 

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:05.850
 have to have class mat in the class 

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:08.009
 and always goes through as the main subject 

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:09.479
 I already knew that from the seventh 

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:10.550
 eighth grade actually already knew in 

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:12.220
 the sixth grade 

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:13.970
 that's not for me in general 

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:15.830
 natural sciences physics chemistry 

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:16.910
 that was not my thing, instead 

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:19.220
 I was much more interested 

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:20.690
 history politics also German I found 

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:22.940
 very exciting subjects in which one much 

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:25.340
 in which one philosophizes in 

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:27.260
 where you understand connections 

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:28.160
 logical thinking is not quite the same 

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:30.080
 she was more concerned about that 

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:31.460
 Humanities tell me 

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:32.600
 you something I'll the eleventh grade 

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:34.970
 almost stayed seated 

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:37.220
 my cut was somewhere at 2.0 

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:39.170
 but I have almost a five in math 

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:40.520
 get and almost a 5 and french 

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:41.630
 At the end I forgave the wall too 

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:43.190
 one made four and that's why 

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:45.020
 did not sit down though all 

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:46.610
 other subjects was good and that can 

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:48.800
 actually be or just because you're in 

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:51.320
 certain areas not good 

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:52.670
 is it complete failure of the system I 

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:54.560
 find the school of the future must be so 

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:56.390
 look that you look what a 

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:58.580
 talent has a student and this 

00:02:56.390 --> 00:03:00.080
 Giftedness is then specially promoted 

00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:01.700
 I know many people for example 

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:03.920
 artistically extremely gifted 

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:05.990
 otherwise they are not really good 

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:08.030
 in math in the languages ​​maybe too 

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:11.090
 not in course absolutely great 

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:13.250
 why should these students get worse 

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:14.930
 Maybe as other students 

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:16.520
 in art are bad but in there for 

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:17.959
 math release just because of any 

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:19.340
 Clever people have said you have to 

00:03:17.959 --> 00:03:22.010
 in addition to math but a curve discussion 

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:24.140
 and if you can paint 3d moderately 

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:25.940
 that's not so important that's why 

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:27.920
 so why are there these rigid plans 

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:30.200
 why is there this curriculum at the 

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:32.209
 I have to orient myself 

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:34.640
 School should look like this in the future 

00:03:32.209 --> 00:03:37.459
 that first five years 

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:39.530
 the basic things are learning together 

00:03:37.459 --> 00:03:41.660
 not split and after these five 

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:43.280
 years is then looked at which 

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:45.200
 Application has a student and then there 

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:46.970
 it only two different types of school 

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:49.820
 There is a kind of school in the end 

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:52.100
 qualifies a university to 

00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:53.720
 attend a study and a school 

00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:55.280
 the conclusion enables one 

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:56.600
 Of course, training can also be done 

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:59.270
 always jumping back and forth when 

00:03:56.600 --> 00:04:01.880
 that must be the case in the end and 

00:03:59.270 --> 00:04:03.410
 There are gifts on both types of school 

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:05.630
 Branches are available in every vintage level 

00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:06.950
 a class that is artistic 

00:04:05.630 --> 00:04:09.650
 Naturally, one of the most important things is to be oriented 

00:04:06.950 --> 00:04:11.269
 music there is a 1 2 is 

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:12.450
 scientifically oriented the 

00:04:11.269 --> 00:04:14.220
 linguistically oriented and 

00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:16.380
 of the circle scientifically oriented 

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:18.450
 and depending on which has ability to 

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:20.459
 is one then in this class teacher 

00:04:18.450 --> 00:04:23.100
 also an important topic i find 

00:04:20.459 --> 00:04:24.900
 Teacher is an extremely important job and 

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:26.400
 everyone has my respect as a teacher 

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:27.870
 many of my friends are working 

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:29.400
 Teachers and they keep telling me 

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:31.350
 from their problems but also from theirs 

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:33.120
 success experiences and I would not be 

00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:34.500
 become a journalist then I would be today 

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:36.000
 in fact, I probably teach 

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:36.870
 am teacher is really quite a whole 

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:38.150
 great job 

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:40.410
 but I find in the teacher training 

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:43.770
 should pay even more attention in the future 

00:04:40.410 --> 00:04:45.120
 that teachers become more moderators 

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:47.070
 your students will become their own 

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:48.690
 Thinking makes many teachers do it 

00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:50.910
 that definitely straight into the fan 

00:04:48.690 --> 00:04:52.860
 Politics or religion, but you can 

00:04:50.910 --> 00:04:54.840
 You can also reinforce in math 

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:57.240
 you can also question things in 

00:04:54.840 --> 00:05:00.240
 discuss sports with specific things 

00:04:57.240 --> 00:05:02.340
 it's just too much work 

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:03.630
 what teachers work through their alumni 

00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:04.919
 have to and you have to and you can 

00:05:03.630 --> 00:05:06.750
 need you can both the to the of 

00:05:04.919 --> 00:05:08.430
 above is given so if you times 

00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:09.780
 make a bit leaner and teacher 

00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:11.760
 more space is available with the pupils 

00:05:09.780 --> 00:05:13.560
 talk then discuss developed 

00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:15.479
 And I really believe something 

00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:15.990
 good and, as I said, respect for everyone 

00:05:15.479 --> 00:05:17.370
 teachers 

00:05:15.990 --> 00:05:18.990
 because teachers do not just have theirs 

00:05:17.370 --> 00:05:20.789
 but to beat students 

00:05:18.990 --> 00:05:22.169
 even with their parents and I know 

00:05:20.789 --> 00:05:24.419
 it is sometimes a lot more 

00:05:22.169 --> 00:05:25.800
 fiercer school is something so important 

00:05:24.419 --> 00:05:27.419
 Here is the foundation stone for 

00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:29.160
 his future life and if you're after 

00:05:27.419 --> 00:05:31.080
 six or seven school year already like that 

00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:32.760
 it's frustrating because you say it 

00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:34.740
 can stop of course and I can not 

00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:36.510
 but I can speak very well 

00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:38.310
 Sport then you come in Germany 

00:05:36.510 --> 00:05:39.450
 not so far you do it then 

00:05:38.310 --> 00:05:41.010
 maybe some degree if 

00:05:39.450 --> 00:05:43.110
 you do not go straight to school 

00:05:41.010 --> 00:05:44.700
 breaks off and that determines the complete 

00:05:43.110 --> 00:05:46.289
 future life but that does not have to 

00:05:44.700 --> 00:05:48.450
 you can be here attaches and can 

00:05:46.289 --> 00:05:49.889
 say that you're good at sports 

00:05:48.450 --> 00:05:52.260
 Do a lot more sport now 

00:05:49.889 --> 00:05:53.940
 math well the basic mass and 

00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:55.410
 the rest also spoke fundamentally 

00:05:53.940 --> 00:05:57.360
 but we focus on that 

00:05:55.410 --> 00:05:59.099
 you can and I really think that 

00:05:57.360 --> 00:06:00.930
 important and that would also ensure 

00:05:59.099 --> 00:06:01.979
 that it is much less frustrations 

00:06:00.930 --> 00:06:03.750
 I read recently 

00:06:01.979 --> 00:06:06.120
 about five percent of all adolescents 

00:06:03.750 --> 00:06:07.620
 in Germany are depressed under 

00:06:06.120 --> 00:06:09.030
 because they are under great pressure 

00:06:07.620 --> 00:06:10.200
 suffering that can not be easy 

00:06:09.030 --> 00:06:12.450
 or that is really terrible 

00:06:10.200 --> 00:06:14.639
 that 's why i find the school of 

00:06:12.450 --> 00:06:16.270
 the future really has to be gifted 

00:06:14.639 --> 00:06:18.160
 she has to orient 

00:06:16.270 --> 00:06:20.680
 be with each other and she should too 

00:06:18.160 --> 00:06:23.230
 not in this old system that 

00:06:20.680 --> 00:06:24.790
 tripartite school system work 

00:06:23.230 --> 00:06:27.010
 but should be an open system 

00:06:24.790 --> 00:06:29.290
 you can change and with talent 

00:06:27.010 --> 00:06:32.320
 Branches in the different vintage levels 

00:06:29.290 --> 00:06:34.330
 that's the way i think that should 

00:06:32.320 --> 00:06:36.010
 Definitely doing something I think 

00:06:34.330 --> 00:06:37.630
 It will not be that way because you know 

00:06:36.010 --> 00:06:39.190
 School is a country thing in this state 

00:06:37.630 --> 00:06:40.300
 do as it pleases and get up there 

00:06:39.190 --> 00:06:41.590
 all times are agreed 

00:06:40.300 --> 00:06:42.760
 probably twenty thirty years and over 

00:06:41.590 --> 00:06:44.860
 then all other countries have us 

00:06:42.760 --> 00:06:46.750
 overtaken all right we let ourselves 

00:06:44.860 --> 00:06:48.730
 Surprise what would surprise me 

00:06:46.750 --> 00:06:50.200
 your opinion she just writes 

00:06:48.730 --> 00:06:51.910
 like to comment in the comments tells me how 

00:06:50.200 --> 00:06:53.560
 should the school be with your future 

00:06:51.910 --> 00:06:55.540
 Opinion on the look I find very 

00:06:53.560 --> 00:06:57.430
 The school system makes us stupid 

00:06:55.540 --> 00:06:58.900
 what is your opinion about it writes like 

00:06:57.430 --> 00:07:00.310
 down there and finally I still have 

00:06:58.900 --> 00:07:01.270
 a very important thing I do as 

00:07:00.310 --> 00:07:02.800
 wrong addressed 

00:07:01.270 --> 00:07:05.290
 There are really great teachers in there 

00:07:02.800 --> 00:07:06.820
 Germany and teachers are gaining a lot 

00:07:05.290 --> 00:07:09.220
 rarely recognition and praise for this 

00:07:06.820 --> 00:07:10.600
 important work they do besides 

00:07:09.220 --> 00:07:12.490
 a thing namely the German 

00:07:10.600 --> 00:07:15.280
 Teacher price there will always be special 

00:07:12.490 --> 00:07:17.170
 creative very outstanding teaching 

00:07:15.280 --> 00:07:18.070
 excellent and you can have yours there 

00:07:17.170 --> 00:07:19.660
 teacher's suggestion 

00:07:18.070 --> 00:07:21.910
 he says the mister or the wife 

00:07:19.660 --> 00:07:22.990
 they are really good as well 

00:07:21.910 --> 00:07:24.430
 Beat them before the German 

00:07:22.990 --> 00:07:26.590
 teacher price the link to it you will find 

00:07:24.430 --> 00:07:28.420
 down in the infobox and then gets 

00:07:26.590 --> 00:07:30.550
 your teachers may be your teacher 

00:07:28.420 --> 00:07:31.930
 Price the whole thing is so in the fall 

00:07:30.550 --> 00:07:34.330
 then the award ceremony we can 

00:07:31.930 --> 00:07:35.500
 until July, the teachers also submit 

00:07:34.330 --> 00:07:36.490
 Here I do not get any money for that 

00:07:35.500 --> 00:07:38.500
 I say that I am the German 

00:07:36.490 --> 00:07:40.360
 teacher price simply important more info 

00:07:38.500 --> 00:07:41.620
 as I said below in the infobox that is 

00:07:40.360 --> 00:07:42.970
 video has become longer again than 

00:07:41.620 --> 00:07:44.560
 i wanted that comes one at 

00:07:42.970 --> 00:07:47.830
 Do not teach in the bag he goes 

00:07:44.560 --> 00:07:51.390
 just 45 minutes and my videos 

00:07:47.830 --> 00:07:51.390
 fortunately not 45 minutes
