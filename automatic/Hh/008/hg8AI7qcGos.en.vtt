00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:15.389 
we'll try to bring those temperatures

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:16.730 
we'll try to bring those temperatures
back<00:00:15.540> up<00:00:15.599> but<00:00:15.870> these<00:00:15.960> low<00:00:16.139> temperatures<00:00:16.560> are

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:16.740 
back up but these low temperatures are

forecaster of course I would recommend
becoming<00:00:54.840> a<00:00:55.230> meteorologist<00:00:55.980> so<00:00:56.070> you<00:00:56.190> have<00:00:56.340> a

you can be on TV and forecasting the

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:03.229 
you can be on TV and forecasting the
weather<00:01:01.770> you<00:01:02.640> can<00:01:02.789> be<00:01:02.879> called<00:01:03.120> a

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 
weather you can be called a

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:04.910 
weather you can be called a
meteorologist<00:01:03.899> but<00:01:03.989> some<00:01:04.320> folks<00:01:04.470> don't<00:01:04.799> have

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
meteorologist but some folks don't have

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:07.190 
meteorologist but some folks don't have
degrees<00:01:05.519> in<00:01:05.630> meteorology<00:01:06.630> and<00:01:06.810> so<00:01:06.990> if<00:01:07.080> you

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
degrees in meteorology and so if you

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:08.990 
degrees in meteorology and so if you
want<00:01:07.439> to<00:01:07.530> do<00:01:07.979> it<00:01:08.100> the<00:01:08.189> right<00:01:08.310> way<00:01:08.549> and<00:01:08.580> get<00:01:08.909> the

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
want to do it the right way and get the

want to do it the right way and get the
degree<00:01:09.240> get<00:01:09.450> the<00:01:09.540> understanding<00:01:10.020> of<00:01:10.080> the

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
degree get the understanding of the

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:11.450 
degree get the understanding of the
atmosphere<00:01:10.500> so<00:01:10.650> you<00:01:10.680> can<00:01:10.830> branch<00:01:11.070> off<00:01:11.220> into

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
atmosphere so you can branch off into

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:12.440 
atmosphere so you can branch off into
other<00:01:11.549> things<00:01:11.880> as<00:01:12.030> well

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450

Wyoming if he wants a winter weather

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:40.429 
Wyoming if he wants a winter weather
that's<00:01:39.150> a<00:01:39.240> great<00:01:39.420> place<00:01:39.630> to<00:01:39.750> go<00:01:39.869> if<00:01:40.049> you<00:01:40.140> wanted

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:40.439 
that's a great place to go if you wanted

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:42.319 
that's a great place to go if you wanted
to<00:01:40.500> study<00:01:40.710> weather<00:01:41.070> and<00:01:41.369> get<00:01:41.759> a<00:01:41.820> focus<00:01:42.299> because

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:42.329 
to study weather and get a focus because

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:44.120 
to study weather and get a focus because
typically<00:01:42.899> you'll<00:01:43.110> focus<00:01:43.470> on<00:01:43.590> the<00:01:43.680> weather<00:01:43.890> in

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
typically you'll focus on the weather in

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:46.219 
typically you'll focus on the weather in
that<00:01:44.340> region<00:01:44.549> if<00:01:44.850> you<00:01:44.939> go<00:01:45.090> here<00:01:45.479> in<00:01:45.600> Central

the<00:01:52.470> Florida<00:01:52.890> University<00:01:53.070> is<00:01:53.430> a<00:01:53.549> very<00:01:53.790> good

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090 
the Florida University is a very good

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:56.149 
the Florida University is a very good
and<00:01:54.570> especially<00:01:55.259> good<00:01:55.409> at<00:01:55.470> Tropical

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:56.159 
and especially good at Tropical

00:01:56.159 --> 00:01:57.950 
and especially good at Tropical
Meteorology<00:01:56.579> I<00:01:56.850> took<00:01:57.090> a<00:01:57.180> minor<00:01:57.390> in<00:01:57.540> Tropical

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:57.960 
Meteorology I took a minor in Tropical

00:01:57.960 --> 00:01:59.480 
Meteorology I took a minor in Tropical
Meteorology<00:01:58.200> as<00:01:58.560> well<00:01:58.770> here<00:01:59.009> the<00:01:59.130> Northeast

00:01:59.480 --> 00:01:59.490 
Meteorology as well here the Northeast

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:01.280 
Meteorology as well here the Northeast
and<00:01:59.640> then<00:01:59.729> up<00:02:00.030> and<00:02:00.240> doing<00:02:00.390> this<00:02:00.600> all<00:02:00.840> kinds<00:02:01.200> of

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:01.290 
and then up and doing this all kinds of

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:04.010 
and then up and doing this all kinds of
universities<00:02:01.500> here<00:02:02.250> to<00:02:02.969> offer<00:02:03.210> degrees<00:02:03.990> in

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:04.020 
universities here to offer degrees in

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:05.600 
universities here to offer degrees in
meteorology<00:02:04.770> so<00:02:04.829> that's<00:02:05.040> the<00:02:05.219> way<00:02:05.310> that<00:02:05.460> you

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:05.610 
meteorology so that's the way that you

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:07.100 
meteorology so that's the way that you
want<00:02:05.790> to<00:02:05.850> do<00:02:05.969> that<00:02:06.180> and<00:02:06.420> one<00:02:06.750> of<00:02:06.869> the<00:02:06.930> things

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:07.110 
want to do that and one of the things

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:08.749 
want to do that and one of the things
that<00:02:07.290> you'll<00:02:07.439> learn<00:02:07.469> in<00:02:07.860> there<00:02:08.069> is<00:02:08.250> you'll

00:02:08.749 --> 00:02:08.759 
that you'll learn in there is you'll

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:11.240 
that you'll learn in there is you'll
learn<00:02:08.910> about<00:02:09.090> what<00:02:09.300> we<00:02:09.360> call<00:02:09.539> a<00:02:09.720> skew<00:02:10.259> tea<00:02:10.530> skew

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:11.250 
learn about what we call a skew tea skew

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:12.600 
learn about what we call a skew tea skew
teas<00:02:11.430> we're<00:02:11.640> taking<00:02:11.940> the<00:02:12.030> atmosphere

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:12.610 
teas we're taking the atmosphere

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:14.460 
teas we're taking the atmosphere
gonna<00:02:12.730> skill<00:02:13.300> the<00:02:13.570> temperature<00:02:14.050> that<00:02:14.260> means

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:14.470 
gonna skill the temperature that means

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:15.930 
gonna skill the temperature that means
the<00:02:14.680> temperature<00:02:14.740> line<00:02:15.220> is<00:02:15.340> skewed<00:02:15.670> over<00:02:15.850> to

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:15.940 
the temperature line is skewed over to

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:17.340 
the temperature line is skewed over to
the<00:02:16.030> side<00:02:16.210> here<00:02:16.240> and<00:02:16.720> this<00:02:16.930> is<00:02:17.080> when<00:02:17.290> the

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:17.350 
the side here and this is when the

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:18.480 
the side here and this is when the
hot-air<00:02:17.650> balloon<00:02:17.890> goes<00:02:18.100> up<00:02:18.130> the<00:02:18.370> weather

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:18.490 
hot-air balloon goes up the weather

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:20.070 
hot-air balloon goes up the weather
balloon<00:02:18.730> this<00:02:19.300> is<00:02:19.480> the<00:02:19.570> track<00:02:19.810> of<00:02:19.960> the

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:20.080 
balloon this is the track of the

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:21.480 
balloon this is the track of the
temperature<00:02:20.440> and<00:02:20.530> I'm<00:02:20.590> showing<00:02:21.040> this<00:02:21.160> because

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:21.490 
temperature and I'm showing this because

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:23.280 
temperature and I'm showing this because
typically<00:02:21.910> you'll<00:02:22.360> see<00:02:22.540> this<00:02:22.660> line<00:02:22.930> go<00:02:23.140> up

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:23.290 
typically you'll see this line go up

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:25.770 
typically you'll see this line go up
this<00:02:23.560> way<00:02:23.830> but<00:02:23.890> it<00:02:24.130> is<00:02:24.220> so<00:02:24.520> warm<00:02:24.850> aloft<00:02:25.210> this
