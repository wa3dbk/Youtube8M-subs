00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:41.680 
was really cool as you can see down
there<00:01:40.700> we<00:01:40.849> also<00:01:41.000> have<00:01:41.240> something<00:01:41.420> where<00:01:41.630> it

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:41.690 
there we also have something where it

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:43.359 
there we also have something where it
says<00:01:41.840> images<00:01:42.259> and<00:01:42.410> that<00:01:42.830> is<00:01:42.950> a<00:01:42.979> little<00:01:43.220> bit

00:01:43.359 --> 00:01:43.369 
says images and that is a little bit

00:01:43.369 --> 00:01:45.249 
says images and that is a little bit
harder<00:01:43.819> to<00:01:43.970> read<00:01:44.240> but<00:01:44.750> I<00:01:44.780> could<00:01:44.990> we<00:01:45.080> can<00:01:45.170> go

00:01:45.249 --> 00:01:45.259 
harder to read but I could we can go

00:01:45.259 --> 00:01:47.080 
harder to read but I could we can go
ahead<00:01:45.380> and<00:01:45.560> take<00:01:45.979> a<00:01:46.039> look<00:01:46.250> at<00:01:46.399> this<00:01:46.520> next<00:01:46.759> image

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:47.090 
ahead and take a look at this next image

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:49.150 
ahead and take a look at this next image
and<00:01:47.869> we<00:01:47.929> can<00:01:48.080> really<00:01:48.200> dive<00:01:48.500> into<00:01:48.530> here<00:01:48.979> and

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:49.160 
and we can really dive into here and

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:50.440 
and we can really dive into here and
actually<00:01:49.310> these<00:01:49.819> are<00:01:49.880> going<00:01:50.149> to<00:01:50.209> be<00:01:50.270> the

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:50.450 
actually these are going to be the

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:52.540 
actually these are going to be the
achievements<00:01:51.050> to<00:01:51.619> what<00:01:51.950> you<00:01:52.039> guys<00:01:52.190> will<00:01:52.399> get

00:01:55.029 --> 00:01:55.039 
after completing the heist and doing it

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:57.400 
after completing the heist and doing it
properly<00:01:55.250> so<00:01:55.550> taking<00:01:56.420> a<00:01:56.509> quick<00:01:56.750> gander<00:01:57.229> at<00:01:57.380> it

00:01:57.400 --> 00:01:57.410 
properly so taking a quick gander at it

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:59.080 
properly so taking a quick gander at it
with<00:01:57.770> it<00:01:57.979> says<00:01:58.190> here<00:01:58.369> on<00:01:58.489> the<00:01:58.580> very<00:01:58.759> first<00:01:59.000> one

00:02:03.249 --> 00:02:03.259 
setup iced complete highest prep mission

00:02:03.259 --> 00:02:04.930 
setup iced complete highest prep mission
obviously<00:02:04.009> once<00:02:04.190> you<00:02:04.280> finish<00:02:04.520> that<00:02:04.550> that

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:04.940 
obviously once you finish that that

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:06.800 
obviously once you finish that that
would<00:02:05.060> be<00:02:05.090> that<00:02:05.360> achievement

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:06.810 
would be that achievement

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:07.910 
would be that achievement
completely<00:02:07.200> high<00:02:07.350> spin<00:02:07.590> alley<00:02:07.710> without

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:09.750 
anyone dying that'd be really good and

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:11.210 
anyone dying that'd be really good and
