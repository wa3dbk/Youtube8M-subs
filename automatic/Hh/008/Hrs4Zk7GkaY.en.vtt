00:00:01.350 --> 00:00:12.610
 look for me if you want it look better and 

00:00:06.549 --> 00:00:16.900
 we go more you will know by the presence that 

00:00:12.610 --> 00:00:23.980
 I want to say goodbye to you as your whims 

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:30.359
 they have fed me up with me I am not and everything 

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:34.770
 that so loved today in my whole soul 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:34.770
 because I want 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:50.190
 without inhabiting 

00:00:41.329 --> 00:00:59.239
 what a day because I want them to be frank 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:59.239
 and loyal and without hiding our 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:06.350
 ok in this song we're going to use the 

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:09.020
 strum number 7 thumb down 

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:12.799
 index up 

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:15.670
 three fingers down with snap e 

00:01:12.799 --> 00:01:15.670
 index up 

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:26.390
 these four movements that normally 

00:01:18.799 --> 00:01:30.220
 we would touch them in this way we are going to 

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:30.220
 perform them but with this rhythm 

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:41.840
 good and you have to realize the 

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:45.100
 difference that exists at the normal rate of 

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:45.100
 radio number 7 is this 

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:49.820
 and the rhythm for this song is 

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:12.740
 good and you have to clarify it also has the 

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:14.260
 chord of the largest that is normally 

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:16.810
 he does so 

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:18.740
 I got used to putting it in that 

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:20.870
 shape 

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:24.830
 I hope you do not take confusions you 

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:26.660
 you can touch it in the traditional way or 

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:30.260
 maybe you can also try to do in 

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:32.830
 the court of the major in that way 

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:32.830
 do not 

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:37.710
 good and also in the accord of D minor 

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:45.060
 I make a variation that I put what I put 

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:48.800
 with these fingers and I make the variation a 

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:48.800
 variation that falls very well in this case 

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:53.530
 it's not like I'm changing chords 

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:55.630
 I'm just doing a little 

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:57.870
 variation about it I agreed to re 

00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:57.870
 less 

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:06.070
 ok this song is on page 41 of 

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:06.070
 the 100 best memories
