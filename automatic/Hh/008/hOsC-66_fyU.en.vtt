00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570 
we we grab move finder items here and we

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:37.730 
we we grab move finder items here and we
just<00:01:33.840> move<00:01:34.409> to<00:01:34.650> the<00:01:34.680> right<00:01:34.950> and<00:01:35.250> we<00:01:35.939> choose<00:01:36.740> the

let's<00:01:50.759> say<00:01:50.970> you<00:01:51.030> like<00:01:51.180> screen<00:01:52.579> shots<00:01:54.470> say<00:01:56.750> I

00:01:59.139 --> 00:01:59.149 
let's say you like screen shots say I

00:01:59.149 --> 00:02:01.459 
let's say you like screen shots say I
because<00:02:00.149> I<00:02:00.270> already<00:02:00.360> have<00:02:00.750> one<00:02:01.049> so<00:02:01.259> I'm<00:02:01.350> gonna

00:02:01.459 --> 00:02:01.469 
because I already have one so I'm gonna

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:07.160 
because I already have one so I'm gonna
just<00:02:01.799> replace<00:02:02.280> it<00:02:02.549> you<00:02:03.360> go<00:02:05.390> so<00:02:06.390> let's<00:02:06.659> do<00:02:06.930> a

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:07.170 
just replace it you go so let's do a

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:08.229 
just replace it you go so let's do a
test

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:08.239 
test

00:02:08.239 --> 00:02:13.330 
test
so<00:02:09.239> we<00:02:09.420> gonna<00:02:09.629> give<00:02:09.959> a<00:02:10.430> command<00:02:11.430> shift

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:13.340 
so we gonna give a command shift

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:17.170 
so we gonna give a command shift
took<00:02:14.340> my<00:02:14.580> screenshot<00:02:15.110> just<00:02:16.110> wait<00:02:16.319> for<00:02:16.560> sack

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:17.180 
took my screenshot just wait for sack

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:27.350 
took my screenshot just wait for sack
and<00:02:18.890> turn<00:02:19.890> here<00:02:20.489> you<00:02:20.700> go<00:02:24.530> my<00:02:25.530> new<00:02:26.360> screenshot

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:27.360 
and turn here you go my new screenshot

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:31.309 
and turn here you go my new screenshot
folder<00:02:28.010> so<00:02:29.010> I<00:02:29.250> think<00:02:29.730> this<00:02:30.120> is<00:02:30.300> helpful<00:02:30.660> there

00:02:31.309 --> 00:02:31.319 
folder so I think this is helpful there

00:02:31.319 --> 00:02:33.710 
folder so I think this is helpful there
are<00:02:31.530> other<00:02:31.739> ways<00:02:32.010> to<00:02:32.069> do<00:02:32.519> with<00:02:32.940> terminal<00:02:33.540> or

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:33.720 
are other ways to do with terminal or

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:35.990 
are other ways to do with terminal or
some<00:02:34.050> software<00:02:34.680> but<00:02:34.860> I<00:02:34.890> think<00:02:35.220> this<00:02:35.519> is<00:02:35.760> pretty

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:36.000 
some software but I think this is pretty

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.050 
some software but I think this is pretty
easy<00:02:36.200> with<00:02:37.200> use<00:02:37.590> the<00:02:37.830> Automator<00:02:38.280> I<00:02:38.519> hope<00:02:38.849> you

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:39.060 
easy with use the Automator I hope you

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:41.599 
easy with use the Automator I hope you
enjoy
