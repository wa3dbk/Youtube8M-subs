00:04:57.680 --> 00:04:57.690 
just a little bit because we don't want

00:04:57.690 --> 00:05:01.760 
just a little bit because we don't want
this<00:04:57.900> to<00:04:58.199> look<00:04:58.490> too<00:04:59.490> defined<00:04:59.940> or<00:05:00.770> perfect

00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:01.770 
this to look too defined or perfect

00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:03.830

because<00:05:02.580> obviously<00:05:03.090> we<00:05:03.389> want<00:05:03.570> it<00:05:03.660> to<00:05:03.750> look

00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:03.840 
because obviously we want it to look

00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:06.170 
because obviously we want it to look
more<00:05:04.020> natural<00:05:04.080> which<00:05:04.500> is<00:05:04.650> the<00:05:04.770> point<00:05:05.009> so<00:05:05.849> we're

00:05:06.170 --> 00:05:06.180 
more natural which is the point so we're

00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:07.610 
more natural which is the point so we're
just<00:05:06.210> gonna<00:05:06.449> go<00:05:06.690> ahead<00:05:06.780> and<00:05:06.900> smudge<00:05:07.320> that<00:05:07.349> out
