 I met have a good laugh when 

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:26.279
 I asked them if my lunch 

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:30.250
 would do their business 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:31.810
 no actually footballers spend 

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:35.020
 twice as many calories as the 

00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:37.239
 average already and as a result he in 

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:45.550
 consuming a lot more quantity

 financial support from his parents for 

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:56.470
 eat well 

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:59.019
 a chance because he claims to engulf 

00:00:56.470 --> 00:01:01.989
 at least 150 dollars a week 

00:00:59.019 --> 00:01:05.830
 whose meat in half it is too low 

00:01:01.989 --> 00:01:08.920
 often looks like meat with wild or 

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:10.420
 quinoa does that the three together but 

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:11.410
 genetec vegetables obviously could 

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:22.000
 look for all my vitamins 

00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:24.909
 even breakfast lunch i will tell you 4h 

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:26.320
 favor four hours with white 

00:01:24.909 --> 00:01:30.789
 of egg even in surplus than the threat 

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:32.560
 be a boss alex robert student in 

00:01:30.789 --> 00:01:34.660
 kinesiology is a little bit more 

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:36.429
 aware that the majority 

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:39.220
 the important thing is the choice of food 

00:01:36.429 --> 00:01:40.060
 he never consumes any more id before 

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:42.640
 lunch time 

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:44.229
 question of maximizing one's energy in the end 

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:45.310
 by day and according to its 

00:01:44.229 --> 00:01:46.930
 training 

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:49.210
 the opposite of his teammate 

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:51.430
 vincent cleroux gaudreault but me i 

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:51.970
 eat carbohydrates really all along 

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:54.189
 of the day 

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:56.229
 the receiver of passes of 6 feet and 210 

00:01:54.189 --> 00:01:57.700
 books must run the fastest 

00:01:56.229 --> 00:02:00.520
 possible to stand out 

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:02.380
 he therefore favors the absorption of 

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:04.780
 carbs at all times a whole fuel 

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:07.539
 that I spend I have the bottom the 

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:09.160
 recover with the carbs redo my 

00:02:07.539 --> 00:02:11.050
 fuel reserve 

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:13.900
 so I'm sure I eat a lot 

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:16.920
 a lot the general diet for 

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:19.660
 football ball players will look like 

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:21.069
 dietician nutritionist geneviÃ¨ve to 

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:22.690
 countdown agrees that he is 

00:02:21.069 --> 00:02:24.640
 normal that the menus of the players varies 

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:27.549
 somewhat depending on their position 

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:29.290
 and their role is for example a 

00:02:27.549 --> 00:02:31.959
 line player requiring more 

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:34.209
 force to engulf in principle more 

00:02:31.959 --> 00:02:36.250
 protein but she puts a flat mama 

00:02:34.209 --> 00:02:38.470
 often the mistake that athletes go 

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:40.540
 finally those who will put too much 

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:42.670
 protein that will also bring 

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:44.560
 lipids a diet too rich in 

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:45.489
 fat or fat in the athlete is going 

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:47.170
 create fatigue 

00:02:45.489 --> 00:02:49.150
 she also recalls and advises 

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:50.799
 athletes always prioritized the 

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:53.260
 Rehydration after a match or 

00:02:50.799 --> 00:02:55.450
 training and then carried a 

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:57.010
 great attention to recovery 

00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:59.590
 it's important to promote 

00:02:57.010 --> 00:03:01.810
 muscle recovery so in the 30 

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:04.150
 minutes after the end of the competition 

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:06.519
 or training he has to 

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:08.500
 resume carbs and in the six 

00:03:06.519 --> 00:03:10.920
 hours later he must resume 

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:10.920
 protein 

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:16.210
 and ultimate to ten the athletes the key 

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:17.800
 it is to offer once a week 

00:03:16.210 --> 00:03:19.930
 a reward they call 

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:21.550
 commonly in their intimate universe 

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:26.730
 million it's true that I did for 

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:26.730
 the pizza put it behind us 

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:32.370
 here which allows all of canada to
