it sets really quickly and in a way it's

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:53.760 
it sets really quickly and in a way it's
kind<00:01:52.180> of<00:01:52.360> a<00:01:52.480> good<00:01:52.630> thing<00:01:52.900> because<00:01:53.260> you<00:01:53.740> know

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:58.950 
it's gonna last all day but if you're
looking<00:01:56.409> for<00:01:56.620> something<00:01:56.860> to<00:01:57.310> smudge<00:01:57.960> this

00:01:58.950 --> 00:01:58.960

looking for something to smudge this
really<00:01:59.650> sets<00:02:00.280> too<00:02:00.610> quickly<00:02:00.850> for<00:02:01.390> smudging<00:02:01.840> at

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:02.050

really sets too quickly for smudging at
least<00:02:02.260> for<00:02:02.500> me<00:02:02.620> I<00:02:03.180> definitely<00:02:04.180> wasn't<00:02:04.420> fast

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:04.750 
least for me I definitely wasn't fast

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:07.649

enough<00:02:04.900> to<00:02:05.620> smudge<00:02:05.890> this<00:02:06.130> it's<00:02:06.430> really<00:02:06.820> it

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:07.659 
enough to smudge this it's really it

00:02:07.659 --> 00:02:10.259

00:02:31.699 --> 00:02:31.709 
a gel eyeliner open it up it comes to

00:02:31.709 --> 00:02:33.440 
a gel eyeliner open it up it comes to
take<00:02:32.160> the<00:02:32.190> cap<00:02:32.490> off<00:02:32.640> and<00:02:32.850> then<00:02:32.970> has<00:02:33.150> another

take the cap off and then has another
cap<00:02:33.780> which<00:02:34.560> is<00:02:34.770> great<00:02:35.070> and<00:02:35.370> I'll<00:02:35.520> tell<00:02:35.730> you<00:02:35.850> why

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:39.060 
and if you own fluid lines or gel

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:41.720 
and if you own fluid lines or gel
eyeliners<00:02:39.600> definitely<00:02:40.560> max<00:02:40.860> fluid<00:02:41.250> lines<00:02:41.459> if

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:41.730 
eyeliners definitely max fluid lines if

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:44.059 
eyeliners definitely max fluid lines if
you<00:02:41.910> leave<00:02:42.150> them<00:02:42.330> open<00:02:42.540> and<00:02:43.050> expose<00:02:43.739> it<00:02:43.920> to<00:02:43.950> air

00:02:44.059 --> 00:02:44.069 
you leave them open and expose it to air

00:02:44.069 --> 00:02:48.140 
you leave them open and expose it to air
it'll<00:02:45.060> start<00:02:45.390> to<00:02:45.450> dry<00:02:45.780> out<00:02:45.810> so<00:02:46.800> for<00:02:47.790> me<00:02:48.000> at

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:48.150 
it'll start to dry out so for me at

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:51.110 
it'll start to dry out so for me at
least<00:02:48.360> it<00:02:48.480> takes<00:02:48.720> a<00:02:49.020> while<00:02:49.560> to<00:02:50.010> line<00:02:50.760> my<00:02:50.940> eyes

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:51.120 
least it takes a while to line my eyes

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:54.410 
least it takes a while to line my eyes
and<00:02:51.600> I<00:02:52.440> can<00:02:52.470> leave<00:02:52.920> it<00:02:53.070> open<00:02:53.160> for<00:02:53.550> a<00:02:53.610> while<00:02:53.790> so

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:54.420 
and I can leave it open for a while so

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:56.300 
and I can leave it open for a while so
this<00:02:54.720> way<00:02:54.930> I<00:02:54.959> don't<00:02:55.380> have<00:02:55.500> to<00:02:55.650> keep<00:02:55.800> screwing

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:56.310 
this way I don't have to keep screwing

this way I don't have to keep screwing

00:03:19.069 --> 00:03:19.079 
compared to black track fluid line this

00:03:19.079 --> 00:03:24.860 
compared to black track fluid line this
is<00:03:19.140> the<00:03:19.350> Mac<00:03:20.340> gel<00:03:20.730> eyeliner<00:03:22.459> this<00:03:23.459> the<00:03:24.390> fluid

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:27.810 
line is a little bit more fluid so it's

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:31.430 
line is a little bit more fluid so it's
creamier<00:03:28.530> it's<00:03:29.130> less<00:03:29.549> it's<00:03:29.940> less<00:03:30.440> resistant

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:31.440 
creamier it's less it's less resistant

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:35.030

pencil aqua eyes let me cover this up so
yeah<00:04:31.430> this<00:04:32.360> is<00:04:32.720> a<00:04:33.590> little<00:04:34.250> bit<00:04:34.430> less<00:04:35.150> I<00:04:36.039> don't

00:04:37.029 --> 00:04:37.039 
yeah this is a little bit less I don't

00:04:37.039 --> 00:04:38.379 
yeah this is a little bit less I don't
even<00:04:37.130> know<00:04:37.370> how<00:04:37.550> to<00:04:37.580> explain<00:04:37.699> to<00:04:38.060> this<00:04:38.150> guys

00:04:38.379 --> 00:04:38.389 
even know how to explain to this guys

00:04:38.389 --> 00:04:40.960 
even know how to explain to this guys
like<00:04:38.960> I<00:04:39.139> told<00:04:39.440> you<00:04:39.620> don't<00:04:39.800> do<00:04:39.949> reviews<00:04:40.280> but

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:40.970 
like I told you don't do reviews but

00:04:40.970 --> 00:04:44.170 
like I told you don't do reviews but
what<00:04:41.780> I'm<00:04:41.900> saying<00:04:42.169> is<00:04:42.349> that<00:04:42.530> the<00:04:42.860> liner<00:04:43.729> holds

00:04:44.170 --> 00:04:44.180 
what I'm saying is that the liner holds

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:46.330 
what I'm saying is that the liner holds
up<00:04:44.270> better<00:04:44.389> to<00:04:44.660> the<00:04:44.780> brush<00:04:45.080> and<00:04:45.349> you<00:04:45.500> get<00:04:45.770> what

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:46.340 
up better to the brush and you get what

00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:48.279 
up better to the brush and you get what
you<00:04:46.490> need<00:04:46.699> on<00:04:46.940> the<00:04:46.970> you<00:04:47.449> know<00:04:47.570> end<00:04:47.840> of<00:04:48.110> the

00:04:48.279 --> 00:04:48.289 
you need on the you know end of the

00:04:48.289 --> 00:04:50.050 
you need on the you know end of the
brush<00:04:48.500> without<00:04:48.919> getting<00:04:49.250> lumps<00:04:49.610> all<00:04:49.729> over<00:04:49.759> it

00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:50.060 
brush without getting lumps all over it

00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:53.230 
brush without getting lumps all over it
and<00:04:50.240> without<00:04:50.810> having<00:04:51.620> to<00:04:52.160> wipe<00:04:52.580> the<00:04:52.820> sides<00:04:53.000> of

00:04:53.230 --> 00:04:53.240 
and without having to wipe the sides of

00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:55.839 
and without having to wipe the sides of
the<00:04:53.360> brush<00:04:53.570> all<00:04:53.840> the<00:04:53.870> time<00:04:54.229> of<00:04:55.160> course<00:04:55.520> if<00:04:55.699> you

00:04:55.839 --> 00:04:55.849 
the brush all the time of course if you

00:04:55.849 --> 00:04:58.540 
the brush all the time of course if you
like<00:04:56.110> vary<00:04:57.110> your<00:04:57.320> brush<00:04:57.650> in<00:04:57.860> there<00:04:58.070> it<00:04:58.310> might

00:04:58.540 --> 00:04:58.550 
like vary your brush in there it might

00:04:58.550 --> 00:05:00.610 
like vary your brush in there it might
happen<00:04:58.789> but<00:04:59.150> it's<00:04:59.389> a<00:04:59.599> lot<00:04:59.810> more<00:05:00.020> resistant<00:05:00.590> to

00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:00.620 
happen but it's a lot more resistant to

00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:03.939 
happen but it's a lot more resistant to
that<00:05:00.860> so<00:05:01.699> in<00:05:01.970> that<00:05:02.000> way<00:05:02.419> I've<00:05:02.810> like<00:05:03.349> this<00:05:03.650> more

00:05:03.939 --> 00:05:03.949 
that so in that way I've like this more

00:05:03.949 --> 00:05:06.189 
that so in that way I've like this more
than<00:05:04.130> the<00:05:04.190> fluid<00:05:04.580> line<00:05:04.759> but<00:05:05.599> on<00:05:05.750> the<00:05:05.900> same<00:05:06.139> note

00:05:06.189 --> 00:05:06.199 
than the fluid line but on the same note

00:05:06.199 --> 00:05:08.770 
than the fluid line but on the same note
if<00:05:06.710> you<00:05:06.949> have<00:05:06.979> a<00:05:07.250> fluid<00:05:07.639> line<00:05:07.940> I<00:05:08.210> would<00:05:08.570> not

00:05:08.770 --> 00:05:08.780 
if you have a fluid line I would not

00:05:08.780 --> 00:05:10.839 
if you have a fluid line I would not
throw<00:05:09.110> up<00:05:09.169> my<00:05:09.320> fluid<00:05:09.680> line<00:05:09.860> to<00:05:10.099> buy<00:05:10.280> this<00:05:10.340> it's

00:05:10.839 --> 00:05:10.849 
throw up my fluid line to buy this it's

00:05:10.849 --> 00:05:13.300 
throw up my fluid line to buy this it's
basically<00:05:11.360> the<00:05:11.539> same<00:05:11.750> thing<00:05:12.050> you<00:05:12.710> can<00:05:12.740> do<00:05:13.160> the

00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:13.310 
basically the same thing you can do the

00:05:13.310 --> 00:05:15.189 
basically the same thing you can do the
same<00:05:13.550> thing<00:05:13.880> with<00:05:14.030> a<00:05:14.060> fluid<00:05:14.330> line<00:05:14.539> you<00:05:14.720> can<00:05:14.930> put

00:05:15.189 --> 00:05:15.199 
same thing with a fluid line you can put

00:05:15.199 --> 00:05:17.950 
same thing with a fluid line you can put
black<00:05:15.650> track<00:05:15.979> all<00:05:16.250> over<00:05:16.699> your<00:05:16.820> eye<00:05:16.849> and<00:05:17.270> have<00:05:17.930> a

00:05:17.950 --> 00:05:17.960 
black track all over your eye and have a

00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:21.460 
black track all over your eye and have a
lot<00:05:18.229> of<00:05:18.259> proof<00:05:18.650> cream<00:05:19.580> eye<00:05:19.759> shadow<00:05:19.900> so<00:05:20.900> you

00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:21.470 
lot of proof cream eye shadow so you

00:05:21.470 --> 00:05:25.089 
lot of proof cream eye shadow so you
know<00:05:21.590> it's<00:05:22.280> just<00:05:22.639> a<00:05:23.139> little<00:05:24.139> bit<00:05:24.409> different<00:05:24.830> in

00:05:25.089 --> 00:05:25.099 
know it's just a little bit different in

00:05:25.099 --> 00:05:27.939 
know it's just a little bit different in
terms<00:05:25.400> of<00:05:25.639> consistency<00:05:26.090> how<00:05:26.870> thick<00:05:27.530> it<00:05:27.680> is<00:05:27.770> I

00:05:27.939 --> 00:05:27.949 
terms of consistency how thick it is I

00:05:27.949 --> 00:05:30.580 
terms of consistency how thick it is I
guess<00:05:28.190> so<00:05:28.940> the<00:05:29.270> fluid<00:05:29.599> line<00:05:29.840> is<00:05:30.110> a<00:05:30.139> lot<00:05:30.349> more

00:05:30.580 --> 00:05:30.590 
guess so the fluid line is a lot more

00:05:30.590 --> 00:05:33.939 
guess so the fluid line is a lot more
fluid<00:05:31.009> like<00:05:31.550> the<00:05:31.729> name<00:05:31.940> says<00:05:32.180> so<00:05:32.479> it's<00:05:32.800> it's<00:05:33.800> a

00:05:33.939 --> 00:05:33.949 
fluid like the name says so it's it's a

00:05:33.949 --> 00:05:36.969 
fluid like the name says so it's it's a
lot<00:05:34.130> easier<00:05:34.460> to<00:05:34.780> put<00:05:35.780> it<00:05:35.900> across<00:05:36.050> your<00:05:36.530> eye<00:05:36.560> but

00:05:36.969 --> 00:05:36.979 
lot easier to put it across your eye but

00:05:36.979 --> 00:05:38.740 
lot easier to put it across your eye but
you<00:05:37.039> have<00:05:37.190> to<00:05:37.310> clean<00:05:37.490> it<00:05:37.520> off<00:05:37.729> more<00:05:37.940> but<00:05:38.479> that's

00:05:38.740 --> 00:05:38.750 
you have to clean it off more but that's

00:05:38.750 --> 00:05:41.499 
you have to clean it off more but that's
not<00:05:38.990> to<00:05:39.199> say<00:05:39.229> that<00:05:39.409> the<00:05:40.070> aqua<00:05:40.610> black<00:05:40.849> is<00:05:41.180> not

00:05:41.499 --> 00:05:41.509 
not to say that the aqua black is not

00:05:41.509 --> 00:05:43.149 
not to say that the aqua black is not
fluid<00:05:41.900> enough<00:05:42.139> where<00:05:42.380> you<00:05:42.470> have<00:05:42.620> to<00:05:42.770> chunk<00:05:43.039> it

00:05:43.149 --> 00:05:43.159 
fluid enough where you have to chunk it

00:05:43.159 --> 00:05:46.810 
fluid enough where you have to chunk it
still<00:05:43.490> fluid<00:05:43.880> but<00:05:45.099> relative<00:05:46.099> to<00:05:46.520> the<00:05:46.610> other

00:05:46.810 --> 00:05:46.820 
still fluid but relative to the other

00:05:46.820 --> 00:05:49.420 
still fluid but relative to the other
which<00:05:47.479> is<00:05:47.509> important<00:05:48.139> word<00:05:48.349> there<00:05:48.430> relative

00:05:49.420 --> 00:05:49.430 
which is important word there relative

00:05:49.430 --> 00:05:55.360 
which is important word there relative
to<00:05:50.210> the<00:05:50.360> other<00:05:51.009> it's<00:05:52.009> not<00:05:52.310> as<00:05:52.580> fluid<00:05:53.259> so<00:05:54.370> yeah

00:05:55.360 --> 00:05:55.370 
to the other it's not as fluid so yeah

00:05:55.370 --> 00:05:57.270 
to the other it's not as fluid so yeah
that's<00:05:55.729> what<00:05:55.849> I<00:05:55.880> have<00:05:55.970> to<00:05:56.120> say<00:05:56.360> they're<00:05:56.750> both

00:05:57.270 --> 00:05:57.280 
that's what I have to say they're both

00:05:57.280 --> 00:06:01.629 
that's what I have to say they're both
waterproof<00:05:59.650> water-resistant<00:06:00.650> whatever<00:06:00.919> this

00:06:01.629 --> 00:06:01.639 
waterproof water-resistant whatever this

00:06:01.639 --> 00:06:04.810 
waterproof water-resistant whatever this
says<00:06:01.880> waterproof<00:06:02.560> this<00:06:03.560> I<00:06:03.919> don't<00:06:04.099> know<00:06:04.219> what

00:06:04.810 --> 00:06:04.820 
says waterproof this I don't know what

00:06:04.820 --> 00:06:06.550 
says waterproof this I don't know what
the<00:06:04.969> terminology<00:06:05.419> they<00:06:06.050> use<00:06:06.080> for<00:06:06.469> this

00:06:06.550 --> 00:06:06.560 
the terminology they use for this

00:06:06.560 --> 00:06:08.980 
the terminology they use for this
waterproof<00:06:07.130> or<00:06:07.250> water-resistant<00:06:07.969> but<00:06:08.150> I'm

00:06:08.980 --> 00:06:08.990 
waterproof or water-resistant but I'm

00:06:08.990 --> 00:06:10.689 
waterproof or water-resistant but I'm
not<00:06:09.199> gonna<00:06:09.380> go<00:06:09.590> swimming<00:06:09.979> in<00:06:10.099> this<00:06:10.250> you<00:06:10.610> know

00:06:10.689 --> 00:06:10.699 
not gonna go swimming in this you know

00:06:10.699 --> 00:06:14.589 
not gonna go swimming in this you know
what<00:06:10.820> I<00:06:10.880> mean<00:06:11.380> so<00:06:12.610> yeah<00:06:13.610> I<00:06:13.639> think<00:06:13.789> that's<00:06:14.270> all

00:06:14.589 --> 00:06:14.599 
what I mean so yeah I think that's all
