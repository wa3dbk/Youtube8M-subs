00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:24.270 
that the our research suggests very

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:26.059 
that the our research suggests very
strongly<00:02:24.720> that<00:02:24.870> the<00:02:25.379> Super<00:02:25.620> Bowl<00:02:25.650> works

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:28.860 
really well for automakers and that

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:30.440 
really well for automakers and that
there<00:02:29.040> has<00:02:29.129> a<00:02:29.160> very<00:02:29.430> big<00:02:29.610> impact<00:02:29.790> for<00:02:30.090> what<00:02:30.300> we

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:30.450 
there has a very big impact for what we

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:31.940 
there has a very big impact for what we
see<00:02:30.629> them<00:02:30.810> get<00:02:30.989> into<00:02:31.230> the<00:02:31.349> ad<00:02:31.470> game<00:02:31.500> in<00:02:31.860> a<00:02:31.920> big

see them get into the ad game in a big
way<00:02:32.310> in<00:02:32.340> 2011<00:02:33.120> I<00:02:33.300> I<00:02:33.750> think<00:02:34.200> so<00:02:34.410> because<00:02:34.650> I<00:02:34.830> think

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:35.010 
way in 2011 I I think so because I think

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:37.070 
way in 2011 I I think so because I think
that<00:02:35.310> all<00:02:35.940> that<00:02:36.150> all<00:02:36.300> the<00:02:36.420> signs<00:02:36.720> are<00:02:37.019> that

00:02:48.699 --> 00:02:48.709 
are they spending their dollars instead

00:02:48.709 --> 00:02:51.500 
are they spending their dollars instead
well<00:02:49.709> there<00:02:49.920> are<00:02:50.040> lots<00:02:50.310> of<00:02:50.640> other<00:02:50.790> other<00:02:51.269> ways

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:51.510 
well there are lots of other other ways

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:53.390 
well there are lots of other other ways
of<00:02:51.720> spending<00:02:51.959> spending<00:02:52.500> money<00:02:52.830> lots<00:02:53.099> of<00:02:53.220> other

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:53.400 
of spending spending money lots of other

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:55.339 
of spending spending money lots of other
TV<00:02:53.819> spots<00:02:54.300> lots<00:02:54.569> of<00:02:54.720> other<00:02:54.840> parts<00:02:55.200> of<00:02:55.290> the

00:02:55.339 --> 00:02:55.349 
TV spots lots of other parts of the

00:02:55.349 --> 00:02:58.160 
TV spots lots of other parts of the
media<00:02:55.709> mix<00:02:55.950> that<00:02:56.129> you<00:02:56.280> can<00:02:56.459> use<00:02:57.019> but<00:02:58.019> I<00:02:58.050> think

00:02:58.160 --> 00:02:58.170 
media mix that you can use but I think

00:02:58.170 --> 00:02:59.570 
media mix that you can use but I think
that<00:02:58.379> you<00:02:58.680> know<00:02:58.800> obviously<00:02:58.950> there<00:02:59.310> are<00:02:59.340> only<00:02:59.430> a

00:02:59.570 --> 00:02:59.580 
that you know obviously there are only a

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:02.089 
that you know obviously there are only a
finite<00:02:59.849> number<00:03:00.060> of<00:03:00.390> spots<00:03:00.750> you<00:03:01.019> can<00:03:01.050> get<00:03:01.349> in

00:03:02.089 --> 00:03:02.099 
finite number of spots you can get in

00:03:02.099 --> 00:03:05.300 
finite number of spots you can get in
and<00:03:02.459> around<00:03:02.700> the<00:03:03.480> Super<00:03:04.019> Bowl<00:03:04.190> but<00:03:05.190> I<00:03:05.220> think

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:05.310 
and around the Super Bowl but I think

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:07.369 
and around the Super Bowl but I think
the<00:03:05.489> truth<00:03:05.879> is<00:03:06.030> it's<00:03:06.480> a<00:03:06.569> very<00:03:06.750> high<00:03:06.989> entry

00:03:07.369 --> 00:03:07.379 
the truth is it's a very high entry

00:03:07.379 --> 00:03:08.990 
the truth is it's a very high entry
price<00:03:07.590> and<00:03:08.069> you've<00:03:08.580> got<00:03:08.670> to<00:03:08.760> be<00:03:08.849> pretty

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:09.000 
price and you've got to be pretty

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:10.580 
price and you've got to be pretty
confident<00:03:09.569> that<00:03:09.629> you've<00:03:10.110> got<00:03:10.230> a<00:03:10.260> big<00:03:10.470> enough

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:10.590 
confident that you've got a big enough

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:12.290 
confident that you've got a big enough
budget<00:03:10.709> to<00:03:11.040> take<00:03:11.280> that<00:03:11.489> and<00:03:11.700> also<00:03:11.849> you<00:03:12.030> can

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:12.300 
budget to take that and also you can

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:13.790 
budget to take that and also you can
build<00:03:12.569> on<00:03:12.780> that<00:03:12.810> throughout<00:03:13.200> the<00:03:13.379> rest<00:03:13.530> of<00:03:13.620> the

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:13.800 
build on that throughout the rest of the

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:15.080 
build on that throughout the rest of the
year<00:03:13.890> and<00:03:14.220> I<00:03:14.280> guess<00:03:14.430> we're<00:03:14.610> now<00:03:14.700> seeing<00:03:14.909> as

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:15.090 
year and I guess we're now seeing as
