00:00:03.440 --> 00:00:06.270
 hello everyone I find you 

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:07.799
 this week to show how I 

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:09.090
 realized my skin at phone but 

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:12.450
 Also when I change the style 

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:13.590
 ci with only one hull for the 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:15.150
 first wolf I currently have on 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:16.410
 my phone you will need to 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:17.010
 dried flowers and a hull 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:18.449
 transparent 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:19.590
 after picking my flowers I have them 

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:21.060
 laid flat in a book for a 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:22.020
 week and they are now dry 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:23.670
 and ready to use 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:24.900
 I take my phone is a little 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:27.050
 random mans I arrange the flowers 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:27.050
 above 

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:32.300
 no need for glue just put 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:32.300
 the coast over it and that's it 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:38.820
 for the 2nd design I take a feather 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:40.199
 and my hull same principle that with the 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:42.090
 flowers I place my pen on my 

00:00:40.199 --> 00:00:44.269
 phone and I put my share of 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:44.269
 sid 

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:49.730
 for this cock if I want to tell you 

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:52.730
 the classic I print design I 

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:54.230
 trace the contours and I cut 

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:55.489
 do not forget to cut the cutter 

00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:57.350
 replacing the microphone and the device 

00:00:55.489 --> 00:00:59.030
 photo for example and I start again with 

00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:03.500
 the rest of my designs I just have to 

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:04.580
 place them under the shell and that's it for 

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:05.720
 the last design I use 

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:07.760
 glitter is still my hull 

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:08.930
 seamless flexible game but payet for 

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:13.490
 do like a rain of glitter 

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:14.630
 I put my phone and here you are 

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:15.830
 can also drop a few 

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:19.759
 glitter here and there for some 

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:20.899
 something more discreet or even there the 

00:01:19.759 --> 00:01:23.770
 francos he had to be no finer 

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:23.770
 but for a look that throws 

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:29.390
 I now go to the cover you 

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:30.920
 will need two printed fabrics 

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:32.690
 for the design of this one I you 

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:35.090
 invite to watch my previous video or 

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:36.530
 day - how to make and use of 

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:38.360
 solid color fabric for the interior 

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:41.510
 I take a first white fabric 

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:43.250
 I apply my printed fabric on it 

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:45.620
 take my second printed and 

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:46.640
 I place it face to face I finish in 

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:48.590
 putting the last layer of fabric 

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:49.180
 white I'm going to come sew at the level of 

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:51.500
 dashed 

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:52.700
 I do that the sewing machine but you 

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:54.440
 can do this very well by hand 

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:56.330
 now I 'm going to make a hem in 

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:56.780
 folding a first time and then a 

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:58.790
 second 

00:01:56.780 --> 00:02:00.790
 I pass to pass on for the 

00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:04.960
 maintain and I just have to sew 

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:04.960
 once done I have to do the other side 

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:09.679
 I just have to return my cover 

00:02:06.979 --> 00:02:11.240
 on the place and that's it I hope these 

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:12.290
 debates will have you more I make you from 

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:15.250
 big kisses and I tell you to the 

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:15.250
