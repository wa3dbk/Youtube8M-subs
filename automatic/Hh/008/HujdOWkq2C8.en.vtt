we are going to press a again to find
out<00:01:28.770> who<00:01:28.950> the<00:01:29.130> other<00:01:29.250> two<00:01:29.460> players<00:01:29.759> were<00:01:30.060> and

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360 
out who the other two players were and

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:34.760 
out who the other two players were and
they<00:01:31.200> were<00:01:31.970> messy<00:01:32.970> and<00:01:33.240> hazards<00:01:34.079> so<00:01:34.290> we

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770 
they were messy and hazards so we

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:36.410 
they were messy and hazards so we
probably<00:01:35.040> got<00:01:35.430> the<00:01:35.549> best<00:01:35.579> out<00:01:35.909> of<00:01:35.970> three<00:01:36.240> then

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
probably got the best out of three then

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:37.850 
probably got the best out of three then
messy<00:01:36.750> probably<00:01:37.079> would<00:01:37.229> have<00:01:37.290> been<00:01:37.470> better<00:01:37.680> to

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
messy probably would have been better to

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:39.950 
messy probably would have been better to
put<00:01:38.040> in<00:01:38.130> a<00:01:38.189> team<00:01:38.400> but<00:01:39.030> i<00:01:39.090> do<00:01:39.210> have<00:01:39.479> mess<00:01:39.720> in<00:01:39.930> my

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
put in a team but i do have mess in my

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:42.109 
put in a team but i do have mess in my
club<00:01:40.380> so<00:01:40.680> i<00:01:40.710> might<00:01:41.070> put<00:01:41.310> him<00:01:41.400> in<00:01:41.520> their<00:01:41.670> team<00:01:41.880> at

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:42.119 
club so i might put him in their team at

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:44.840 
club so i might put him in their team at
the<00:01:42.240> end<00:01:42.360> anyway<00:01:42.720> so<00:01:43.229> messing<00:01:43.590> has<00:01:43.799> on<00:01:44.009> not<00:01:44.640> too

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:44.850 
the end anyway so messing has on not too

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:46.550

renown are up top but let's just quickly
have<00:02:43.450> a<00:02:43.480> look<00:02:43.540> who<00:02:44.170> the<00:02:44.200> other<00:02:44.500> two<00:02:44.709> players

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:44.980 
have a look who the other two players

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:46.949 
have a look who the other two players
would<00:02:45.160> have<00:02:45.280> been<00:02:45.459> less<00:02:46.450> of<00:02:46.690> a<00:02:46.720> look

00:02:46.949 --> 00:02:46.959
