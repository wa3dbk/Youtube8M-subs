00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:02.159 
this is pretty much widespread approval

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:03.350 
this is pretty much widespread approval
of<00:02:02.280> this<00:02:02.399> type<00:02:02.640> of<00:02:02.670> thing<00:02:02.969> and<00:02:03.090> we've<00:02:03.210> been

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:03.360 
of this type of thing and we've been

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:04.910 
of this type of thing and we've been
critical<00:02:03.750> of<00:02:03.810> everybody<00:02:04.320> who's<00:02:04.469> in<00:02:04.590> favor<00:02:04.710> of

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:06.360 
it we've got to have a more serious

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:08.029 
it we've got to have a more serious
discussion<00:02:06.990> of<00:02:07.079> this<00:02:07.170> this<00:02:07.350> has<00:02:07.590> to<00:02:07.770> become<00:02:07.890> a

00:02:08.029 --> 00:02:08.039 
discussion of this this has to become a

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:10.160 
discussion of this this has to become a
bigger<00:02:08.280> deal<00:02:08.520> the<00:02:09.030> u.s.<00:02:09.360> is<00:02:09.539> using<00:02:09.899> tactics

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:10.170 
bigger deal the u.s. is using tactics

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:11.260 
bigger deal the u.s. is using tactics
apparently

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:11.270 
apparently

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:13.660 
apparently
which<00:02:12.050> by<00:02:12.230> their<00:02:12.440> own<00:02:12.590> standards<00:02:13.220> are

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:13.670 
which by their own standards are

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:16.270 
which by their own standards are
terrorist<00:02:14.540> tactics<00:02:14.990> I<00:02:15.170> know<00:02:15.710> last<00:02:16.070> time<00:02:16.220> we

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:16.280 
terrorist tactics I know last time we

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:18.880 
terrorist tactics I know last time we
talked<00:02:16.640> about<00:02:16.790> drones<00:02:17.270> I<00:02:17.600> i<00:02:17.960> kinda<00:02:18.410> defended

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:18.890 
talked about drones I i kinda defended

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:20.920 
talked about drones I i kinda defended
drone<00:02:19.340> strikes<00:02:19.730> in<00:02:19.880> the<00:02:20.030> use<00:02:20.180> of<00:02:20.210> drones<00:02:20.630> but

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:20.930 
drone strikes in the use of drones but

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:23.170 
drone strikes in the use of drones but
this<00:02:21.110> this<00:02:21.770> is<00:02:21.830> pretty<00:02:22.130> bad<00:02:22.370> i<00:02:22.400> mean<00:02:22.760> the<00:02:22.850> idea

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:23.180 
this this is pretty bad i mean the idea

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:25.810 
this this is pretty bad i mean the idea
is<00:02:23.510> is<00:02:24.170> to<00:02:24.230> get<00:02:24.530> your<00:02:24.620> target<00:02:25.070> with<00:02:25.490> the<00:02:25.580> first

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:25.820 
is is to get your target with the first

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:28.960 
is is to get your target with the first
hit<00:02:26.120> and<00:02:26.390> uh<00:02:26.740> if<00:02:27.740> this<00:02:28.100> is<00:02:28.190> what's<00:02:28.370> happening<00:02:28.460> i

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:28.970 
hit and uh if this is what's happening i

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:31.090 
hit and uh if this is what's happening i
am<00:02:29.510> certainly<00:02:30.080> not<00:02:30.260> proud<00:02:30.440> of<00:02:30.500> that<00:02:30.620> right<00:02:30.980> in

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:31.100 
am certainly not proud of that right in

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:33.310 
am certainly not proud of that right in
other<00:02:31.250> words<00:02:31.490> we<00:02:31.850> whether<00:02:32.660> or<00:02:32.870> not<00:02:33.020> you<00:02:33.200> agree

other words we whether or not you agree

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:35.470 
other words we whether or not you agree
with<00:02:33.590> drone<00:02:33.830> strikes<00:02:34.220> note<00:02:34.490> on<00:02:34.670> the<00:02:34.910> argument

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:35.480 
with drone strikes note on the argument

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:38.050 
with drone strikes note on the argument
can<00:02:35.720> be<00:02:35.780> made<00:02:35.990> that<00:02:36.260> by<00:02:36.830> using<00:02:37.100> drone<00:02:37.610> strikes

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:38.060 
can be made that by using drone strikes

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:40.930 
can be made that by using drone strikes
instead<00:02:38.870> of<00:02:38.900> other<00:02:39.350> methods<00:02:39.920> assuming<00:02:40.910> you

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:40.940 
instead of other methods assuming you

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:43.690 
instead of other methods assuming you
will<00:02:41.180> carry<00:02:41.540> out<00:02:41.780> those<00:02:42.310> operations<00:02:43.310> less

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:43.700 
will carry out those operations less

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:45.910 
will carry out those operations less
civilians<00:02:44.240> will<00:02:44.390> die<00:02:44.570> that<00:02:45.140> argument<00:02:45.410> can<00:02:45.860> be

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:45.920 
civilians will die that argument can be

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:48.010 
civilians will die that argument can be
made<00:02:46.070> that's<00:02:46.670> a<00:02:46.790> separate<00:02:47.150> argument<00:02:47.360> from

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:48.020 
made that's a separate argument from

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:49.900 
made that's a separate argument from
whether<00:02:48.260> this<00:02:48.440> is<00:02:48.500> okay<00:02:48.950> or<00:02:48.980> not<00:02:49.160> and<00:02:49.610> it's

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:49.910 
whether this is okay or not and it's

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:51.730 
whether this is okay or not and it's
totally<00:02:50.150> that<00:02:50.900> argument<00:02:51.350> goes<00:02:51.470> out<00:02:51.620> the

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:51.740 
totally that argument goes out the

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:53.650 
totally that argument goes out the
window<00:02:51.770> doesn't<00:02:52.310> it<00:02:52.550> when<00:02:52.940> you<00:02:53.060> start<00:02:53.330> using<00:02:53.450> a

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:53.660 
window doesn't it when you start using a

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:55.420 
window doesn't it when you start using a
double<00:02:53.930> tap<00:02:54.110> method<00:02:54.500> meant<00:02:54.920> to<00:02:55.070> kill<00:02:55.280> people

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:55.430 
double tap method meant to kill people

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:58.120 
double tap method meant to kill people
that<00:02:55.700> are<00:02:55.820> then<00:02:55.940> in<00:02:56.030> the<00:02:56.120> area<00:02:56.500> right<00:02:57.500> on<00:02:57.740> me<00:02:58.100> I

00:02:58.120 --> 00:02:58.130 
that are then in the area right on me I

00:02:58.130 --> 00:02:59.650 
that are then in the area right on me I
mean<00:02:58.370> it's<00:02:58.490> possible<00:02:58.700> that<00:02:59.060> we're<00:02:59.240> comparing

00:02:59.650 --> 00:02:59.660 
mean it's possible that we're comparing

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:01.720 
mean it's possible that we're comparing
two<00:03:00.140> illegal<00:03:00.440> things<00:03:00.860> and<00:03:01.130> saying<00:03:01.280> which<00:03:01.520> one

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:01.730 
two illegal things and saying which one

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:04.360 
two illegal things and saying which one
is<00:03:01.910> less<00:03:02.180> bad<00:03:02.540> exactly<00:03:03.260> that's<00:03:03.800> exactly<00:03:03.920> what

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:04.370 
is less bad exactly that's exactly what

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:06.370 
is less bad exactly that's exactly what
we're<00:03:04.490> doing<00:03:04.760> yeah<00:03:05.150> so<00:03:05.810> I<00:03:05.840> don't<00:03:06.080> know<00:03:06.140> it

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:06.380 
we're doing yeah so I don't know it

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:08.230 
we're doing yeah so I don't know it
seems<00:03:06.650> to<00:03:06.830> me<00:03:06.920> like<00:03:06.950> this<00:03:07.280> is<00:03:07.490> the<00:03:07.700> one<00:03:08.030> issue

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:08.240 
seems to me like this is the one issue

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:11.230 
seems to me like this is the one issue
where<00:03:08.690> there<00:03:09.470> is<00:03:09.650> bipartisan<00:03:10.280> support<00:03:10.550> for<00:03:10.820> in

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:11.240 
where there is bipartisan support for in

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:12.760 
where there is bipartisan support for in
the<00:03:11.360> US<00:03:11.660> and<00:03:11.930> we<00:03:12.080> need<00:03:12.230> and<00:03:12.470> it's<00:03:12.560> gonna<00:03:12.710> be

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:12.770 
the US and we need and it's gonna be

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:14.350 
the US and we need and it's gonna be
that<00:03:12.980> much<00:03:13.130> more<00:03:13.190> difficult<00:03:13.490> because<00:03:13.910> of<00:03:14.180> that

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:14.360 
that much more difficult because of that

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:16.090 
that much more difficult because of that
actually<00:03:14.840> investigated<00:03:15.500> properly<00:03:15.620> no

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:16.100 
actually investigated properly no

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:17.470 
actually investigated properly no
question<00:03:16.430> about<00:03:16.520> it<00:03:16.640> this<00:03:16.820> has<00:03:16.970> got<00:03:17.209> to<00:03:17.240> be<00:03:17.390> a

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:17.480 
question about it this has got to be a

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:18.820 
question about it this has got to be a
bigger<00:03:17.690> deal<00:03:17.900> again<00:03:18.170> you're<00:03:18.320> not<00:03:18.440> seeing<00:03:18.740> very
