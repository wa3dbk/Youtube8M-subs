00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:09.910
 hello but now we will start a new series named 

00:00:09.910 --> 00:00:11.319
 fishing techniques 

00:00:11.319 --> 00:00:14.489
 we start with one of the most popular techniques among fishermen 

00:00:14.489 --> 00:00:18.019
 professionals of the disaster we speak no more or less inclined to 

00:00:18.019 --> 00:00:20.800
 risking to find one of the most effective techniques and 

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:23.489
 productive club 

00:00:23.489 --> 00:00:27.369
 m will differentiate or the use of the technique explains this end of 

00:00:27.369 --> 00:00:30.369
 season the main one for fishing and debt will pass after the break 

00:00:31.159 --> 00:00:32.700
 I think he has bad luck 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:35.880
 the first run we will see the period preceding the slope of the 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:37.840
 black-bass laperrière 

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:41.460
 this period september approximately february 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:46.110
 to April it depends on the temperature of the drinking water we know that the season 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:50.310
 the rearing line only starts at 21 degrees Celsius 

00:00:50.310 --> 00:00:53.760
 therefore the entire season when the temperature is lower in case of 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:58.430
 crisis it is considered the previous period the 63 32 passes 

00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:02.230
 is not active he is in the process of lowering the temperature he is very 

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:04.040
 reluctant to hearken 

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:08.220
 we will use their very small and with a little action as the activity 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:11.220
 minimal basin we will use the air like this 

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:13.270
 victory 

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:16.270
 notice peace as a person why 

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:19.520
 down to earth two areas 

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:22.930
 simply I sign up 

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:25.680
 he's a completely straight player 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:27.500
 we can not lose 

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:30.500
 primo he is there 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:33.030
 that the vafc to take without problem 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:34.810
 kirkland 

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:38.430
 remember and in two or three years the fish are electrified and the 

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:39.780
 young people when the mobile 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:41.530
 Sunday 

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:44.600
 reportage we speak 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:49.040
 we have to rely on the causes of that name they are currently issuing asking for 

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:49.630
 possible 

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:52.630
 if I tried to open territory 

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:56.780
 today it is not the only one to meet this period we have a lot 

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:59.010
 other 

00:01:59.010 --> 00:02:01.720
 paris seems long because our friends who loses the ball 

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:05.980
 aleo solar that will make him talk about their long-term adventure is as well as 

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:09.449
 datsyuk two cases all too mr 

00:02:09.449 --> 00:02:11.639
 there are a lot of scenes inside 

00:02:11.639 --> 00:02:14.459
 it is ideal for this season of the metropolis 

00:02:14.459 --> 00:02:18.520
 as the smuggler is reluctant to eat when he takes the mayor conjures up the sky 

00:02:18.519 --> 00:02:21.209
 he will be interested and not let go 

00:02:21.209 --> 00:02:25.109
 really beautiful ball length and who believe that just running this 

00:02:25.109 --> 00:02:28.069
 who was a little afraid 

00:02:28.069 --> 00:02:31.910
 people3 bet we differentiated and the little beach for the post 

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:35.120
 Denmark has weakened a lot because it did what we absolutely want 

00:02:35.969 --> 00:02:39.700
 there have been these little ones he resumes his good he has not eaten since a few 

00:02:39.699 --> 00:02:43.329
 country weeks after his arrival that's when we should use 

00:02:43.329 --> 00:02:47.339
 when very mobilized for example this fine of 4 kb season will work 

00:02:47.339 --> 00:02:51.499
 wonderfully the spokesperson during this period that we will use the links 

00:02:51.499 --> 00:02:55.370
 having more mobility than we insisted before selling salamanders 

00:02:55.369 --> 00:02:57.779
 and greens that have the wind in their sails as soon as they have a lot of 

00:02:57.779 --> 00:03:00.399
 movements of the culture like small fish 

00:03:00.399 --> 00:03:02.789
 the massage at saint-laurent-du-pont isère 

00:03:02.789 --> 00:03:06.359
 there is an incredible action it's a bridge 102 inch to smic all 

00:03:06.359 --> 00:03:08.019
 hackers 

00:03:08.019 --> 00:03:11.200
 when using this technique we usually do not use small walls 

00:03:13.289 --> 00:03:16.979
 and at that time after the pump have used in very mobile aligning this 

00:03:16.979 --> 00:03:19.979
 which is a bit harsh 

00:03:20.519 --> 00:03:23.980
 this technique was invented by the Americans for the employee in the 

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:27.750
 area where there is a lot of fishing pressure it is reported that blacks 

00:03:27.749 --> 00:03:30.870
 in marseille in the general classification vonn has no memory but I do not 

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:34.329
 do not share this opinion just try fishing for black bass 

00:03:34.329 --> 00:03:38.479
 those who spend their time fishing for this species know it perfectly well. 

00:03:38.479 --> 00:03:41.500
 proof the black-bass but maurice about theirs but when it is 

00:03:41.499 --> 00:03:45.299
 hurts that is why when fishing it memorizes theirs and 

00:03:45.299 --> 00:03:46.080
 after his match 

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:49.130
 that's why americans invented it happened 

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:52.690
 to what we have all the places where there is a fishing pressure of the tower 

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:55.690
 where there are a lot of competitions before 5 pm with crystal clear waters in 

00:03:55.690 --> 00:03:58.860
 before probably this one is a technique to fish is good because 

00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:00.680
 that everyone sees no one believes
