Android<00:03:06.910> stock<00:03:07.390> got<00:03:07.900> no<00:03:08.110> Android<00:03:08.890> Beam<00:03:09.069> it's

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:09.280 
Android stock got no Android Beam it's

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:12.240 
Android stock got no Android Beam it's
only<00:03:09.670> apps<00:03:10.120> and<00:03:10.840> stuff<00:03:11.530> like<00:03:11.769> that<00:03:11.829> it's<00:03:12.160> an

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:12.250 
only apps and stuff like that it's an

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:14.280 
only apps and stuff like that it's an
actual<00:03:12.519> whole<00:03:12.730> videos<00:03:13.180> through<00:03:13.569> NFC<00:03:14.110> so

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:14.290 
actual whole videos through NFC so

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:15.420 
actual whole videos through NFC so
that's<00:03:14.470> the<00:03:14.620> difference<00:03:14.799> if<00:03:15.130> you've<00:03:15.250> not

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:15.430 
that's the difference if you've not

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:18.120 
that's the difference if you've not
known<00:03:15.760> but<00:03:16.599> there<00:03:16.900> it<00:03:16.989> is<00:03:17.079> really<00:03:17.829> quickly

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:18.130 
known but there it is really quickly

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:20.910 
known but there it is really quickly
while<00:03:18.250> we<00:03:18.340> turn<00:03:18.519> it<00:03:18.610> on<00:03:18.730> a<00:03:19.110> third<00:03:20.110> we'd<00:03:20.319> compare

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:20.920 
while we turn it on a third we'd compare

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:22.860 
while we turn it on a third we'd compare
with<00:03:21.610> another<00:03:21.880> recently<00:03:22.299> announced<00:03:22.660> phone

the motorola atrix HD as you can see the
size<00:03:26.200> is<00:03:26.440> quite<00:03:26.769> similar<00:03:27.130> although<00:03:28.060> the

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:28.180 
size is quite similar although the

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:32.129 
size is quite similar although the
motorola<00:03:28.660> atrix<00:03:28.799> only<00:03:29.799> has<00:03:29.950> a<00:03:30.780> 4.5<00:03:31.780> inch

and then obviously when you look at the

00:03:38.709 --> 00:03:42.330 
and then obviously when you look at the
size<00:03:39.540> pretty<00:03:40.620> even<00:03:41.620> except<00:03:41.889> for<00:03:41.980> the<00:03:42.040> huge

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:42.340 
size pretty even except for the huge

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:45.090 
size pretty even except for the huge
hump<00:03:42.670> that<00:03:42.970> Motorola's<00:03:43.450> kind<00:03:43.690> of<00:03:44.069> you<00:03:45.069> know

hump that Motorola's kind of you know

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:48.240 
hump that Motorola's kind of you know
done<00:03:45.790> in<00:03:45.970> the<00:03:46.030> past<00:03:46.650> but<00:03:47.650> love<00:03:47.889> you<00:03:48.010> like<00:03:48.160> to

00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:48.250 
done in the past but love you like to

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:49.830 
done in the past but love you like to
see<00:03:48.340> the<00:03:48.459> boot<00:03:48.639> see<00:03:48.880> how<00:03:48.940> long<00:03:49.120> it<00:03:49.239> takes<00:03:49.480> on

00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:49.840 
see the boot see how long it takes on

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:51.390 
see the boot see how long it takes on
the<00:03:49.989> first<00:03:50.260> initial<00:03:50.620> boot<00:03:50.739> so<00:03:50.950> we'll<00:03:51.130> let<00:03:51.340> that

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:51.400 
the first initial boot so we'll let that

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:55.319 
the first initial boot so we'll let that
finish<00:03:51.940> and<00:03:52.329> there<00:03:53.139> it<00:03:53.290> is<00:03:53.850> so<00:03:54.850> there<00:03:55.150> it<00:03:55.299> is

00:03:55.319 --> 00:03:55.329 
finish and there it is so there it is

00:03:55.329 --> 00:03:58.170 
finish and there it is so there it is
couple<00:03:55.900> of<00:03:55.959> white<00:03:56.170> phones<00:03:56.530> here<00:03:57.130> that<00:03:57.819> Kevlar

00:03:58.170 --> 00:03:58.180 
couple of white phones here that Kevlar

00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:00.690 
couple of white phones here that Kevlar
coating<00:03:58.239> on<00:03:58.660> the<00:03:58.750> back<00:03:59.250> so<00:04:00.250> you<00:04:00.430> can<00:04:00.519> see

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:00.700 
coating on the back so you can see

00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:02.849 
coating on the back so you can see
they're<00:04:00.850> pretty<00:04:01.120> similar<00:04:01.329> in<00:04:01.660> size<00:04:01.989> but

00:04:02.849 --> 00:04:02.859 
they're pretty similar in size but
