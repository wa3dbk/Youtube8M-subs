00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:42.580
 friendship 

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:44.870
 is before that they should share the 

00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:46.400
 friends keys 

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:48.860
 Y 

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:51.360
 give them to your friend who has also 

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:53.900
 a 3ds console 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:56.840
 and after that 

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:59.630
 they must pass the pokemon league and 

00:00:56.840 --> 00:01:00.710
 unblock the city for you that going 

00:00:59.630 --> 00:01:04.559
 to the city train station 

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:07.229
 Luminaire city ​​luminaire 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:09.119
 you can disappear the cypress teacher and 

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:12.360
 he gives them the entrance and there they unlock 

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:15.570
 enzymatic then you will find the the 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:18.180
 safari friendship 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:20.930
 of safari friendships and of batik good in 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:20.930
 consisting of 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:26.860
 you must have friends added 

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:31.050
 in this city 

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:31.050
 with the nintendo console sorry 

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:37.430
 what you should do good is 

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:40.190
 talk to the manager of paris and 

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:42.430
 good to disappear your friends and as 

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:42.430
 they will see 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:48.140
 from here in this case it seems two 

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:51.240
 pokemon instead of three that's easy 

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:55.770
 means you have not completed the league 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:02:00.259
 Pokémon and the box will just be filled 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:02:00.259
 when the text is and will be on 3rd 

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:06.200
 and the more added friends you have 

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:08.720
 better, this method is that simple 

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:12.350
 all you need is pokemon because 

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:16.160
 fly and have passed the league and the 

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:21.680
 decay beat but how did I get good 

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:26.090
 the possibility is 1 in 200 because 

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:32.239
 how did you say 10 200 mons ship 

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:37.730
 what is equivalent to 0 0 05 percent of 

00:02:32.239 --> 00:02:41.300
 odds but it's not a string 

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:43.400
 like the radar ship because they can 

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:45.530
 flee the battle or fight to do what 

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:47.810
 who want with the pokemon there 

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:50.120
 you can simply join and that does not 

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:51.920
 missing the char while for the pokemon 

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:55.160
 Well, but you need a lot of patience 

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:59.360
 until the wild pokemon that you wanted 

00:02:55.160 --> 00:03:03.319
 or it appears in several colors good and this 

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:05.420
 has been everything and any query you can 

00:03:03.319 --> 00:03:09.580
 comment on the video or anything 

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:09.580
