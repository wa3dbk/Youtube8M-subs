00:00:11.129 --> 00:00:22.660
 Mr. Noko 

00:00:13.269 --> 00:00:30.460
 I really want to know that he is reading a newspaper on the train and is more concerned about the next newspaper

 Residents who have wit's end one evening was talked about to wanted to know of Mr. No-Gee 

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:55.469

 One morning Mr. Nosy was taking a walk on the boulevard 

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:27.210
 I heard a whistle from a house 

00:01:20.799 --> 00:01:27.210

 The flower has a red bowl attached to it 

00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:47.480
 The next morning I went out for a walk with a flower to heal 

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:52.360
 Beneath it has been heard laughter from the other side of the Tokihei 

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:52.360

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:10.550
 The next morning I went out for a walk to the forest with a flower wrapped in a collapse 

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:16.950
 At that time I heard the sound of cutting wood from behind 

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:22.140
 He wanted to look into the other side of the day but gave up 

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:28.780
 Because also because we thought it might be or get burned 

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:33.270
 The farmer who was hiding was relieved to see him passing by as it was 

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:33.270
 Ok he's alright 

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:41.660
