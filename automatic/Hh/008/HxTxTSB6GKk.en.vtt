00:00:02.149 --> 00:00:02.159 
all right today we have an unboxing of

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:04.390 
all right today we have an unboxing of
my<00:00:02.610> new<00:00:02.820> graphics<00:00:03.240> card<00:00:03.300> which<00:00:03.870> is<00:00:03.899> the

00:00:04.390 --> 00:00:04.400 
my new graphics card which is the

00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:09.200 
my new graphics card which is the

dual XHTML high-speed I'm not sure when

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:12.799 
dual XHTML high-speed I'm not sure when
I'm<00:00:11.550> supposed<00:00:11.700> to<00:00:11.849> stop<00:00:12.059> reading<00:00:12.450> all<00:00:12.660> the

00:00:12.799 --> 00:00:12.809 
I'm supposed to stop reading all the

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:15.560 
I'm supposed to stop reading all the
stuff<00:00:12.990> on<00:00:13.110> the<00:00:13.170> box<00:00:13.349> but<00:00:14.269> for<00:00:15.269> those<00:00:15.389> of<00:00:15.480> you

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:15.570 
stuff on the box but for those of you

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:17.269 
stuff on the box but for those of you
who<00:00:15.630> don't<00:00:15.750> know<00:00:15.960> this<00:00:16.139> is<00:00:16.199> the<00:00:16.320> boost<00:00:16.740> Edition

00:00:17.269 --> 00:00:17.279 
who don't know this is the boost Edition

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:20.000 
who don't know this is the boost Edition
which<00:00:18.000> means<00:00:18.270> they<00:00:18.510> take<00:00:18.720> the<00:00:18.869> stock<00:00:19.680> clock

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:20.010 
which means they take the stock clock

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:21.620 
which means they take the stock clock
speeds<00:00:20.340> and<00:00:20.640> they<00:00:20.730> Jack<00:00:21.060> them<00:00:21.210> up<00:00:21.330> just<00:00:21.510> a

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:21.630 
speeds and they Jack them up just a

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:22.550 
speeds and they Jack them up just a
little<00:00:21.869> bit<00:00:21.990> to<00:00:22.080> give<00:00:22.199> you<00:00:22.260> a<00:00:22.289> little<00:00:22.470> more

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:22.560 
little bit to give you a little more

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:24.019 
little bit to give you a little more
performance<00:00:22.859> I'm<00:00:23.160> probably<00:00:23.310> gonna<00:00:23.519> overclock

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:24.029 
performance I'm probably gonna overclock

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:25.759 
performance I'm probably gonna overclock
it<00:00:24.060> farther<00:00:24.420> anyway<00:00:24.960> but<00:00:25.230> this<00:00:25.380> was<00:00:25.529> a<00:00:25.560> great

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:25.769 
it farther anyway but this was a great

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:29.240 
it farther anyway but this was a great
price<00:00:26.010> so<00:00:26.390> couldn't<00:00:27.390> refuse<00:00:27.830> so<00:00:28.830> yeah<00:00:29.010> this<00:00:29.189> is

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:29.250 
price so couldn't refuse so yeah this is

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:33.560 
price so couldn't refuse so yeah this is
a<00:00:29.369> 79<00:00:30.150> 53<00:00:30.929> gigabytes<00:00:31.349> of<00:00:31.560> ddr3<00:00:32.090> and<00:00:33.090> it<00:00:33.300> is<00:00:33.390> made

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:33.570 
a 79 53 gigabytes of ddr3 and it is made

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:36.380 
a 79 53 gigabytes of ddr3 and it is made
by<00:00:33.600> sapphire<00:00:34.320> so<00:00:35.070> on<00:00:35.430> the<00:00:35.579> box<00:00:35.760> we<00:00:36.149> have<00:00:36.180> the

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:36.390 
by sapphire so on the box we have the

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:38.780 
by sapphire so on the box we have the
standard<00:00:37.350> graphics<00:00:37.770> card<00:00:38.010> half-naked<00:00:38.489> woman

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:38.790

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:40.520 
standard graphics card half-naked woman
wearing<00:00:39.239> an<00:00:39.660> outfit<00:00:39.960> that<00:00:40.110> looks<00:00:40.290> like<00:00:40.379> it

wearing an outfit that looks like it

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:41.750 
wearing an outfit that looks like it
should<00:00:40.559> be<00:00:40.680> from<00:00:40.890> a<00:00:40.950> video<00:00:41.160> game<00:00:41.219> despite<00:00:41.640> the

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:41.760 
should be from a video game despite the

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:44.240 
should be from a video game despite the
fact<00:00:41.969> they're<00:00:42.149> never<00:00:42.329> from<00:00:42.780> the<00:00:43.680> actual<00:00:44.010> video

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:44.250 
fact they're never from the actual video

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:46.400 
fact they're never from the actual video
games<00:00:44.520> which<00:00:44.789> is<00:00:44.910> kind<00:00:45.210> of<00:00:45.239> dumb<00:00:45.510> well<00:00:46.320> it's

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410 
games which is kind of dumb well it's

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:47.990 
games which is kind of dumb well it's
really<00:00:46.530> dumb<00:00:46.770> but<00:00:46.800> it's<00:00:47.340> especially<00:00:47.700> dumb

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
really dumb but it's especially dumb

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:49.549 
really dumb but it's especially dumb
considering<00:00:48.510> this<00:00:48.660> graphics<00:00:49.050> card<00:00:49.079> came<00:00:49.410> with

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559 
considering this graphics card came with

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:51.110 
considering this graphics card came with
a<00:00:49.590> couple<00:00:49.770> free<00:00:50.100> games<00:00:50.340> so<00:00:50.550> I<00:00:50.579> really<00:00:50.820> just<00:00:51.000> put

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 
a couple free games so I really just put

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:54.680 
a couple free games so I really just put
some<00:00:51.270> of<00:00:51.390> those<00:00:51.510> in<00:00:51.719> the<00:00:51.809> box<00:00:52.070> anyway<00:00:53.539> then<00:00:54.539> we

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
some of those in the box anyway then we

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:58.250 
some of those in the box anyway then we
have<00:00:54.870> on<00:00:55.020> the<00:00:55.110> back<00:00:55.289> we<00:00:55.739> just<00:00:55.770> have<00:00:57.260> random

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
have on the back we just have random

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 
and ATI have one on their graphics card

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:07.240 
and ATI have one on their graphics card
since<00:01:04.559> 2002<00:01:05.400> and<00:01:05.430> all<00:01:06.299> that<00:01:06.600> stuff<00:01:06.869> you<00:01:07.170> know

since 2002 and all that stuff you know
one<00:01:08.250> thing<00:01:08.340> I<00:01:08.400> have<00:01:08.490> to<00:01:08.549> say<00:01:08.580> is<00:01:08.760> this<00:01:08.850> box<00:01:09.119> is

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450 
one thing I have to say is this box is

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:11.120 
one thing I have to say is this box is
huge

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
huge

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:12.679 
huge
I<00:01:11.189> hope<00:01:11.610> the<00:01:11.700> graphics<00:01:12.030> card<00:01:12.210> isn't<00:01:12.360> anywhere

00:01:12.679 --> 00:01:12.689 
I hope the graphics card isn't anywhere

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:16.399 
I hope the graphics card isn't anywhere
close<00:01:12.990> to<00:01:13.350> this<00:01:13.619> big<00:01:13.860> because<00:01:14.130> my<00:01:14.880> case<00:01:15.570> would

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
close to this big because my case would

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:18.530 
close to this big because my case would
not<00:01:16.560> hold<00:01:16.740> something<00:01:17.130> this<00:01:17.250> size<00:01:17.430> I<00:01:17.790> have<00:01:18.420> an

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 
not hold something this size I have an

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:22.789 
not hold something this size I have an
antique<00:01:18.869> 900<00:01:19.439> but<00:01:20.570> let's<00:01:21.570> see<00:01:21.840> what's<00:01:22.560> in<00:01:22.710> the

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:22.799 
antique 900 but let's see what's in the

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:27.340 
antique 900 but let's see what's in the
box

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:27.350 

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:30.370 

well<00:01:28.350> I'll<00:01:28.890> just<00:01:29.100> set<00:01:29.250> the<00:01:29.310> Box<00:01:29.490> to<00:01:29.670> the<00:01:29.729> side

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:30.380 
well I'll just set the Box to the side

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:34.010 
well I'll just set the Box to the side
this<00:01:31.380> is<00:01:31.440> pretty<00:01:32.659> actually<00:01:33.659> pretty<00:01:33.840> boring

looking<00:01:34.380> for<00:01:34.560> a<00:01:34.590> graphics<00:01:34.979> card<00:01:35.510> but<00:01:36.680> oh<00:01:38.210> I

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210 
looking for a graphics card but oh I

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:42.109 
looking for a graphics card but oh I
have<00:01:39.390> it<00:01:39.510> upside<00:01:39.630> down<00:01:40.550> this<00:01:41.550> really<00:01:41.880> is<00:01:42.000> the

00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:01.120 
in that box let's shut it and take a

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:10.349 
in that box let's shut it and take a
look<00:04:01.359> at<00:04:01.540> the<00:04:01.659> actual<00:04:02.340> graphics<00:04:03.340> card<00:04:09.359> alright

00:04:10.349 --> 00:04:10.359 
look at the actual graphics card alright

00:04:10.359 --> 00:04:13.559 
look at the actual graphics card alright

the boost Edition so I do get all of the
you<00:05:14.169> know<00:05:14.259> the<00:05:14.440> performance<00:05:14.860> increases<00:05:15.400> and

00:05:15.899 --> 00:05:15.909 
you know the performance increases and

00:05:15.909 --> 00:05:18.210 
you know the performance increases and
everything<00:05:16.330> like<00:05:16.479> that<00:05:16.509> so<00:05:16.740> this<00:05:17.740> is<00:05:17.919> actually

00:05:18.210 --> 00:05:18.220 
everything like that so this is actually

00:05:18.220 --> 00:05:21.230 
everything like that so this is actually
a<00:05:18.280> very<00:05:18.460> attractive<00:05:19.090> looking<00:05:19.210> design<00:05:19.800> and

00:05:21.230 --> 00:05:21.240 
a very attractive looking design and

00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:24.210 
a very attractive looking design and
finally<00:05:22.240> my<00:05:23.080> graphics<00:05:23.500> card<00:05:23.560> manufacturers

00:05:24.210 --> 00:05:24.220 
finally my graphics card manufacturers

00:05:24.220 --> 00:05:26.100 
finally my graphics card manufacturers
are<00:05:24.370> finally<00:05:24.759> starting<00:05:24.820> to<00:05:25.150> print<00:05:25.539> the<00:05:25.870> things

00:05:26.100 --> 00:05:26.110 
are finally starting to print the things

00:05:26.110 --> 00:05:28.230 
are finally starting to print the things
right<00:05:26.470> side<00:05:26.710> up<00:05:26.919> or<00:05:27.039> actually<00:05:27.699> upside<00:05:27.970> down

00:05:28.230 --> 00:05:28.240 
right side up or actually upside down

00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:29.279 
right side up or actually upside down
when<00:05:28.419> you're<00:05:28.539> looking<00:05:28.659> at<00:05:28.810> the<00:05:28.870> cards<00:05:29.169> when

00:05:29.279 --> 00:05:29.289 
when you're looking at the cards when

00:05:29.289 --> 00:05:30.629 
when you're looking at the cards when
you<00:05:29.349> put<00:05:29.500> them<00:05:29.590> in<00:05:29.650> a<00:05:29.710> case<00:05:29.919> the<00:05:30.130> right-side<00:05:30.490> up

00:05:30.629 --> 00:05:30.639 
you put them in a case the right-side up

00:05:30.639 --> 00:05:31.770 
you put them in a case the right-side up
because<00:05:30.820> it<00:05:30.970> wasn't<00:05:31.210> like<00:05:31.300> that<00:05:31.330> for<00:05:31.509> years

00:05:31.770 --> 00:05:31.780 
because it wasn't like that for years

00:05:31.780 --> 00:05:36.260 
because it wasn't like that for years
and<00:05:32.020> I<00:05:32.080> understand<00:05:32.500> why<00:05:32.680> this<00:05:33.400> PCB<00:05:34.000> is<00:05:34.180> huge

00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:36.270 
and I understand why this PCB is huge

00:05:36.270 --> 00:05:38.640 
and I understand why this PCB is huge
yeah<00:05:37.270> very<00:05:37.570> good-looking<00:05:37.750> design<00:05:38.199> you<00:05:38.500> can

00:05:38.640 --> 00:05:38.650 
yeah very good-looking design you can

00:05:38.650 --> 00:05:41.520 
yeah very good-looking design you can
see<00:05:38.860> the<00:05:39.130> the<00:05:40.060> heatsink<00:05:40.599> through<00:05:40.930> it<00:05:41.080> and<00:05:41.349> the

00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:41.530 
see the the heatsink through it and the

00:05:41.530 --> 00:05:43.649 
see the the heatsink through it and the
fans<00:05:41.740> on<00:05:41.949> top<00:05:42.220> on<00:05:42.580> you<00:05:42.789> got<00:05:42.909> your<00:05:43.030> copper<00:05:43.419> pipes

00:05:43.649 --> 00:05:43.659 
fans on top on you got your copper pipes

00:05:43.659 --> 00:05:46.469 
fans on top on you got your copper pipes
underneath<00:05:45.090> it's<00:05:46.090> very<00:05:46.270> good-looking

00:05:46.469 --> 00:05:46.479 
underneath it's very good-looking

00:05:46.479 --> 00:05:48.570 
underneath it's very good-looking
although<00:05:46.930> I'm<00:05:47.050> curious<00:05:47.560> to<00:05:47.740> see<00:05:47.770> how<00:05:47.919> sturdily

00:05:48.570 --> 00:05:48.580 
although I'm curious to see how sturdily

00:05:48.580 --> 00:05:49.530 
although I'm curious to see how sturdily
it<00:05:48.789> sits<00:05:49.029> in<00:05:49.150> my<00:05:49.270> case

00:05:49.530 --> 00:05:49.540 
it sits in my case

00:05:49.540 --> 00:05:52.410 
it sits in my case
considering<00:05:50.290> you<00:05:50.890> know<00:05:50.950> your<00:05:51.160> your<00:05:51.490> tension

00:05:52.410 --> 00:05:52.420 
considering you know your your tension

00:05:52.420 --> 00:05:54.690 
considering you know your your tension
points<00:05:52.690> back<00:05:52.870> here<00:05:53.200> and<00:05:53.440> you<00:05:53.560> don't<00:05:53.740> it<00:05:54.550> used

00:05:54.690 --> 00:05:54.700 
points back here and you don't it used

00:05:54.700 --> 00:05:57.330 
points back here and you don't it used
to<00:05:54.790> be<00:05:54.880> a<00:05:54.910> card<00:05:55.210> was<00:05:55.360> only<00:05:55.570> this<00:05:55.720> wide<00:05:55.930> and<00:05:56.410> you

00:05:57.330 --> 00:05:57.340 
to be a card was only this wide and you
