00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:20.140 
which sounds good enough for 1080p to me

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:22.140 
which sounds good enough for 1080p to me
yeah<00:02:20.290> that<00:02:20.410> sounds<00:02:20.800> good<00:02:20.980> the<00:02:21.820> resolution

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:22.150 
yeah that sounds good the resolution

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:23.940 
yeah that sounds good the resolution
isn't<00:02:22.300> as<00:02:22.540> high<00:02:22.720> as<00:02:22.990> like<00:02:23.140> an<00:02:23.260> imac<00:02:23.560> display

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:23.950 
isn't as high as like an imac display

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:27.330 
isn't as high as like an imac display
which<00:02:24.190> has<00:02:24.370> a<00:02:24.400> 2560<00:02:25.360> by<00:02:25.480> 1440<00:02:25.980> even<00:02:26.980> the<00:02:27.040> iPad

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:27.340 
which has a 2560 by 1440 even the iPad

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:28.590 
which has a 2560 by 1440 even the iPad
is<00:02:27.430> a<00:02:27.459> higher<00:02:27.640> resolution<00:02:27.850> than<00:02:28.209> this<00:02:28.360> but

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:28.600 
is a higher resolution than this but

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:30.030 
is a higher resolution than this but
it's<00:02:28.810> not<00:02:28.930> really<00:02:29.170> a<00:02:29.200> problem<00:02:29.440> because<00:02:29.860> the

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:30.040 
it's not really a problem because the

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:31.710 
it's not really a problem because the
media<00:02:30.310> are<00:02:30.370> you<00:02:30.430> gonna<00:02:30.550> watch<00:02:30.700> on<00:02:30.910> this<00:02:31.060> that's

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:31.720 
media are you gonna watch on this that's

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:34.530 
media are you gonna watch on this that's
native<00:02:32.080> 1080<00:02:32.500> resolution<00:02:32.590> so<00:02:33.430> I<00:02:33.700> think<00:02:34.300> this

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:34.540 
native 1080 resolution so I think this

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:36.120 
native 1080 resolution so I think this
displays<00:02:34.870> better<00:02:35.140> for<00:02:35.350> video<00:02:35.530> than<00:02:35.709> an<00:02:35.830> iMac

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:36.130 
displays better for video than an iMac

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:38.340 
displays better for video than an iMac
because<00:02:36.520> most<00:02:36.760> videos<00:02:37.150> these<00:02:37.300> days<00:02:37.360> are<00:02:37.780> 1080p

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:38.350 
because most videos these days are 1080p

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:40.860 
because most videos these days are 1080p
which<00:02:38.530> is<00:02:38.680> native<00:02:39.100> so<00:02:39.670> look<00:02:39.880> at<00:02:40.000> this<00:02:40.120> GI<00:02:40.420> Joe

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:40.870 
which is native so look at this GI Joe

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:43.490 
which is native so look at this GI Joe
trailer<00:02:41.380> right<00:02:41.620> it<00:02:42.459> is<00:02:42.640> very<00:02:42.730> exciting

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:43.500 
trailer right it is very exciting

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:45.930 
trailer right it is very exciting
hopefully<00:02:44.500> better<00:02:44.709> than<00:02:44.830> the<00:02:45.160> last<00:02:45.370> one<00:02:45.550> which

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:45.940 
hopefully better than the last one which

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:47.310 
hopefully better than the last one which
made<00:02:46.180> me<00:02:46.360> realize<00:02:46.510> the<00:02:46.870> ArcLight

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:47.320 
made me realize the ArcLight

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:48.810 
made me realize the ArcLight
which<00:02:47.620> is<00:02:47.739> a<00:02:47.769> theater<00:02:48.100> in<00:02:48.190> Los<00:02:48.310> Angeles<00:02:48.519> has<00:02:48.790> a

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:48.820 
which is a theater in Los Angeles has a

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:55.770 
which is a theater in Los Angeles has a

00:02:57.420 --> 00:02:57.430 
colors were good not that great they're

00:02:57.430 --> 00:02:59.550 
colors were good not that great they're
little<00:02:57.640> washed<00:02:57.820> out<00:02:58.410> saturation<00:02:59.410> was<00:02:59.530> a

00:02:59.550 --> 00:02:59.560 
little washed out saturation was a

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:01.440 
little washed out saturation was a
little<00:02:59.769> disappointing<00:03:00.250> but<00:03:00.340> overall<00:03:00.580> it's<00:03:01.390> a

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:01.450 
little disappointing but overall it's a

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:03.060 
little disappointing but overall it's a
nice<00:03:01.630> display<00:03:01.900> for<00:03:02.200> looking<00:03:02.440> at<00:03:02.530> video<00:03:02.739> all
