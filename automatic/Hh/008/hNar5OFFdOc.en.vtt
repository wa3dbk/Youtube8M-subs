engine cover on right now I'm gonna try

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:17.500 
engine cover on right now I'm gonna try
to<00:00:13.410> do<00:00:13.650> some<00:00:13.889> temperature<00:00:14.490> readings<00:00:15.360> on<00:00:15.599> it

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:17.510 
to do some temperature readings on it

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:19.269 
to do some temperature readings on it
it's<00:00:17.630> really<00:00:18.080> hard<00:00:18.439> to<00:00:18.560> see<00:00:18.710> the<00:00:18.800> spacer<00:00:19.250> in

driving let's go ahead and shoot it now
till<00:00:40.309> we<00:00:40.339> get<00:00:43.000> sam<00:00:44.000> exact<00:00:44.360> place<00:00:46.210> this<00:00:47.210> is

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:47.360 
till we get sam exact place this is

till we get sam exact place this is
after<00:00:47.750> test<00:00:48.079> driving<00:00:48.320> the<00:00:48.470> car<00:00:48.739> and<00:00:49.129> beaten<00:00:49.699> on

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:49.850 
after test driving the car and beaten on

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:53.830 
after test driving the car and beaten on
it<00:00:50.090> pretty<00:00:50.719> good<00:00:50.899> amount<00:00:51.110> looking<00:00:52.010> at<00:00:52.190> a<00:00:52.840> 106

00:00:53.830 --> 00:00:53.840 
it pretty good amount looking at a 106

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:57.939 
it pretty good amount looking at a 106
degrees<00:00:53.960> surface<00:00:54.649> temp<00:00:54.890> so<00:00:55.609> we're<00:00:55.760> down<00:00:56.949> 35

00:00:57.939 --> 00:00:57.949 
degrees surface temp so we're down 35

00:00:57.949 --> 00:01:03.220 
degrees surface temp so we're down 35
degrees<00:00:58.660> so<00:00:59.980> let's<00:01:01.449> let's<00:01:02.449> shoot<00:01:02.719> the<00:01:02.870> top<00:01:03.079> of

00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:03.230 
degrees so let's let's shoot the top of

00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:07.420 
degrees so let's let's shoot the top of
the<00:01:03.289> heads<00:01:03.530> here

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:07.430 

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:12.070 

you<00:01:07.490> see<00:01:08.000> that<00:01:08.440> that's<00:01:10.720> one<00:01:11.720> hundred<00:01:11.990> and

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:12.080 
you see that that's one hundred and

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:14.650 
you see that that's one hundred and
thirty<00:01:12.410> nine<00:01:12.500> hundred<00:01:12.980> forty<00:01:13.280> degrees<00:01:13.660> that

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:14.660 
thirty nine hundred forty degrees that

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:17.950 
thirty nine hundred forty degrees that
matches<00:01:15.080> exactly<00:01:15.170> what<00:01:15.920> the<00:01:16.960> manifold

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:17.960 
matches exactly what the manifold

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:29.360 

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:32.180 

I'm<00:01:30.360> now<00:01:30.720> she<00:01:30.780> can<00:01:31.230> just<00:01:31.410> atop<00:01:31.740> the<00:01:31.920> intake

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:32.190 
I'm now she can just atop the intake

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:34.840 
I'm now she can just atop the intake
manifold<00:01:32.730> air<00:01:32.910> maybe<00:01:33.630> you<00:01:33.750> can<00:01:33.870> see<00:01:34.020> the<00:01:34.170> laser

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:34.850 
manifold air maybe you can see the laser

right<00:01:35.850> underneath<00:01:36.090> the<00:01:36.270> plenum<00:01:37.340> 100<00:01:38.480> 706<00:01:39.480> we

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 
right underneath the plenum 100 706 we

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:44.900 
right underneath the plenum 100 706 we
shoot<00:01:40.080> it<00:01:40.170> back<00:01:40.290> down<00:01:40.500> again<00:01:43.370> so<00:01:44.370> there<00:01:44.580> is<00:01:44.670> no

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:44.910 
shoot it back down again so there is no

00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:48.350 
shoot it back down again so there is no
doubt<00:01:45.120> that<00:01:45.590> the<00:01:46.730> spaceship<00:01:47.730> does<00:01:47.970> what<00:01:48.270> it

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:48.360 
doubt that the spaceship does what it

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:51.080 
doubt that the spaceship does what it
claims<00:01:48.510> to<00:01:48.870> do<00:01:49.050> as<00:01:49.920> far<00:01:50.160> as<00:01:50.190> heals<00:01:50.580> heat

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090 
claims to do as far as heals heat

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:54.830 
claims to do as far as heals heat
shielding<00:01:51.770> it's<00:01:52.770> a<00:01:53.390> big<00:01:54.390> difference<00:01:54.720> in

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:54.840 
shielding it's a big difference in

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:56.800 
shielding it's a big difference in
temperature<00:01:55.260> right<00:01:55.440> there

00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:56.810 
temperature right there

00:01:56.810 --> 00:02:00.590 
temperature right there
we'll<00:01:57.810> shoot<00:01:58.710> the<00:01:58.860> throttle<00:01:59.280> body<00:01:59.600> that's

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:00.600 
we'll shoot the throttle body that's

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:02.090 
we'll shoot the throttle body that's
probably<00:02:00.960> gonna<00:02:01.080> read<00:02:01.290> a<00:02:01.320> lot<00:02:01.530> lower<00:02:01.740> let's

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:02.100 
probably gonna read a lot lower let's

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:07.340 
probably gonna read a lot lower let's
see<00:02:02.340> yeah<00:02:05.210> so<00:02:06.210> that's<00:02:06.390> before<00:02:06.630> the<00:02:07.170> air

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:07.350 
see yeah so that's before the air

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:08.960 
see yeah so that's before the air
reaches<00:02:07.830> the<00:02:07.950> intake<00:02:08.220> manifold<00:02:08.730> and<00:02:08.850> the

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:08.970 
reaches the intake manifold and the

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:11.930 
reaches the intake manifold and the
runners<00:02:09.300> 9<00:02:09.869> degrees<00:02:10.370> they'll<00:02:11.370> move<00:02:11.640> it<00:02:11.790> up

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:11.940 
runners 9 degrees they'll move it up

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:18.790 
runners 9 degrees they'll move it up
into<00:02:12.420> the<00:02:12.930> runner<00:02:13.140> area<00:02:15.830> underneath

into the runner area underneath

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:20.380 
into the runner area underneath
and<00:02:19.250> then<00:02:19.370> we'll<00:02:19.520> just<00:02:19.670> move<00:02:19.820> on<00:02:20.030> we'll<00:02:20.270> keep

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:20.390 
and then we'll just move on we'll keep

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:22.990 
and then we'll just move on we'll keep
it<00:02:20.570> keep<00:02:20.870> the<00:02:21.020> shot<00:02:21.230> live<00:02:21.580> right<00:02:22.580> onto<00:02:22.880> the
