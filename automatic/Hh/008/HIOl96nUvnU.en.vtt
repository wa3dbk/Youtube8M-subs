think it I would probably consider

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:35.000 
think it I would probably consider
myself<00:00:33.090> to<00:00:33.450> be<00:00:33.600> an<00:00:33.809> ambivert<00:00:34.290> you<00:00:34.739> don't<00:00:34.920> know

00:00:37.549 --> 00:00:37.559 
what an ambivert is is that I have the

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:39.979 
what an ambivert is is that I have the

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
be holding patients there so what

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:20.510 
be holding patients there so what
happened<00:01:18.509> was<00:01:18.840> I<00:01:19.350> walked<00:01:19.740> in<00:01:19.920> there<00:01:20.100> and<00:01:20.130> I

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
happened was I walked in there and I

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:22.399

immediately had seven new admissions
which<00:01:23.189> is<00:01:23.520> pretty<00:01:23.970> challenging<00:01:24.299> because<00:01:24.810> you

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960 
which is pretty challenging because you

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:26.600 
which is pretty challenging because you
have<00:01:25.229> to<00:01:25.409> review<00:01:25.680> all<00:01:25.740> of<00:01:26.070> the<00:01:26.159> orders<00:01:26.549> you

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080 
have to give all of their medications

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:30.289 
have to give all of their medications
and<00:01:28.500> they're<00:01:29.340> all<00:01:29.520> you<00:01:29.880> have<00:01:30.000> to<00:01:30.090> do<00:01:30.180> the

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
and they're all you have to do the

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:31.940 
and they're all you have to do the
admission<00:01:30.659> history<00:01:30.960> and<00:01:31.200> assessment<00:01:31.740> so<00:01:31.829> it's

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
admission history and assessment so it's

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:34.550 
admission history and assessment so it's
a<00:01:32.130> lot<00:01:32.490> of<00:01:32.759> work<00:01:32.970> in<00:01:33.329> addition<00:01:34.079> to<00:01:34.409> that

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
a lot of work in addition to that

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:36.230 
a lot of work in addition to that
without<00:01:34.740> one<00:01:35.070> secretary<00:01:35.369> who<00:01:35.880> was<00:01:35.909> going<00:01:36.180> to

and

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:11.480 
and

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:11.490 
think that you know that's that's a good

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:15.400 
think that you know that's that's a good
trait<00:02:11.760> to<00:02:11.910> have<00:02:11.959> but<00:02:12.959> I<00:02:13.380> have<00:02:14.010> to<00:02:14.280> say<00:02:14.580> the

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:15.410 
trait to have but I have to say the

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:19.790 
trait to have but I have to say the
secretary<00:02:16.410> or<00:02:16.850> summitry<00:02:17.850> technician<00:02:18.360> she<00:02:19.260> is

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:19.800 
secretary or summitry technician she is

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:23.480 
secretary or summitry technician she is
more<00:02:20.640> outspoken<00:02:21.230> she<00:02:22.230> is<00:02:22.620> very<00:02:22.980> extroverted

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:23.490 
more outspoken she is very extroverted

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:26.540 
more outspoken she is very extroverted
and<00:02:24.260> she<00:02:25.260> called<00:02:25.650> the<00:02:25.950> nursing<00:02:26.400> supervisor

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:26.550 
and she called the nursing supervisor

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:29.690 
and she called the nursing supervisor
and<00:02:27.239> was<00:02:27.390> like<00:02:27.540> we<00:02:27.750> are<00:02:27.780> not<00:02:28.230> having<00:02:28.530> that<00:02:28.709> we

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:29.700 
and was like we are not having that we

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:32.809 
and was like we are not having that we
need<00:02:29.970> a<00:02:30.270> nursing<00:02:31.200> assistant<00:02:31.260> right<00:02:32.100> now<00:02:32.280> and

00:02:32.809 --> 00:02:32.819 
need a nursing assistant right now and

00:02:32.819 --> 00:02:34.550 
need a nursing assistant right now and
within<00:02:33.540> 10<00:02:33.810> minutes<00:02:34.050> we<00:02:34.170> had<00:02:34.290> a<00:02:34.319> nursing

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:34.560 
within 10 minutes we had a nursing

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:38.300 
within 10 minutes we had a nursing
assistant<00:02:35.569> so<00:02:36.569> I<00:02:37.020> think<00:02:37.620> that's<00:02:37.950> a<00:02:38.040> really

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:38.310 
assistant so I think that's a really

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:39.860 
assistant so I think that's a really
good<00:02:38.400> example<00:02:38.550> on<00:02:39.270> how<00:02:39.450> different

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:39.870 
good example on how different

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:42.199 
good example on how different
personalities<00:02:40.560> can<00:02:40.770> work<00:02:41.010> together<00:02:41.220> to<00:02:42.030> make

00:02:42.199 --> 00:02:42.209 
personalities can work together to make

00:02:42.209 --> 00:02:43.699 
personalities can work together to make
sure<00:02:42.239> that<00:02:42.690> we<00:02:42.840> are<00:02:42.930> safe<00:02:43.320> and<00:02:43.590> effective

00:02:43.699 --> 00:02:43.709 
sure that we are safe and effective

00:02:43.709 --> 00:02:46.759 
sure that we are safe and effective
caregivers<00:02:44.580> because<00:02:45.510> it<00:02:45.930> wasn't<00:02:46.350> in<00:02:46.560> my

00:02:46.759 --> 00:02:46.769 
caregivers because it wasn't in my

00:02:46.769 --> 00:02:49.190 
caregivers because it wasn't in my
natural<00:02:47.370> name<00:02:48.120> or<00:02:48.300> it<00:02:48.510> wasn't<00:02:48.780> in<00:02:48.840> my<00:02:48.930> nature

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:51.810 
to actually advocate for that but it was

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:52.940 
to actually advocate for that but it was
something<00:02:52.080> that<00:02:52.110> really<00:02:52.230> needed<00:02:52.739> to<00:02:52.769> be<00:02:52.920> done

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:52.950 
something that really needed to be done

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:55.430
