00:00:06.830 --> 00:00:12.830
 did you hear the ancient witch of the blades yes 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:16.699
 it's a teacher's favorite story 

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:19.580
 so you know about the lost masters 

00:00:16.699 --> 00:00:25.820
 it was they who started this battle 

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:25.820
 I hear for the first time, but what are you 

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:18.500
 the light prevails there 

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:21.350
 the future is destined to have said that 

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:24.560
 i can't change it and maybe light 

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:30.940
 will return the light much more than he sees 

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:30.940
 eyes and maybe you will be surprised and hopefully
