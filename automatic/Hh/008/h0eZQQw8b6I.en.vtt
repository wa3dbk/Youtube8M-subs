00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:58.670 
this video's Twitter the other day they
did<00:01:57.060> say<00:01:57.270> it<00:01:57.450> was<00:01:57.509> ready<00:01:57.780> for<00:01:58.020> testing<00:01:58.469> and

00:01:58.670 --> 00:01:58.680 
did say it was ready for testing and

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:00.950 
did say it was ready for testing and
they'll<00:01:59.250> be<00:01:59.369> sending<00:01:59.640> it<00:01:59.909> off<00:02:00.060> very<00:02:00.360> very<00:02:00.479> soon

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:00.960 
they'll be sending it off very very soon

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:03.230 
they'll be sending it off very very soon
so<00:02:01.200> I<00:02:01.469> think<00:02:01.590> if<00:02:01.890> it<00:02:01.979> all<00:02:02.130> just<00:02:02.340> go<00:02:02.490> successful

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:03.240 
so I think if it all just go successful

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:04.789 
so I think if it all just go successful
and<00:02:03.420> it's<00:02:03.780> a<00:02:03.899> thumbs<00:02:04.140> up<00:02:04.350> then<00:02:04.619> they<00:02:04.740> could

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:04.799 
and it's a thumbs up then they could

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:06.800 
and it's a thumbs up then they could
release<00:02:05.250> this<00:02:05.430> before<00:02:05.820> Christmas<00:02:06.329> time<00:02:06.570> I

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:06.810 
release this before Christmas time I

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:08.570 
release this before Christmas time I
also<00:02:07.259> feel<00:02:07.619> the<00:02:07.799> reason<00:02:08.190> why<00:02:08.310> they<00:02:08.490> are

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:08.580 
also feel the reason why they are

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:11.390 
also feel the reason why they are
delaying<00:02:08.940> xbox<00:02:09.630> one<00:02:09.869> and<00:02:10.020> playstation<00:02:10.590> 4

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:11.400 
delaying xbox one and playstation 4

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:13.460 
delaying xbox one and playstation 4
minecraft<00:02:12.000> is<00:02:12.210> because<00:02:12.900> they<00:02:13.019> want<00:02:13.230> to<00:02:13.319> wait

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:13.470 
minecraft is because they want to wait

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:15.440 
minecraft is because they want to wait
till<00:02:13.709> more<00:02:13.920> people<00:02:14.280> have<00:02:14.430> the<00:02:14.550> console<00:02:15.030> this

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:15.450 
till more people have the console this

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:17.000 
till more people have the console this
means<00:02:15.720> that<00:02:15.780> when<00:02:15.989> they<00:02:16.110> do<00:02:16.170> release<00:02:16.590> the<00:02:16.800> game

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:17.010 
means that when they do release the game

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:18.590 
means that when they do release the game
it's<00:02:17.280> more<00:02:17.519> successful

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:18.600
