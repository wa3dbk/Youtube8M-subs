00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
cold and I'm going to be adding my

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:20.719 
cold and I'm going to be adding my
dreams<00:01:18.119> I<00:01:18.450> don't<00:01:18.840> have<00:01:19.170> this<00:01:19.500> Bolivia's<00:01:20.310> on<00:01:20.580> if

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
dreams I don't have this Bolivia's on if

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:22.609 
dreams I don't have this Bolivia's on if
that's<00:01:20.970> conceded<00:01:21.450> the<00:01:21.540> Olivia's<00:01:21.990> organic

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:22.619 
that's conceded the Olivia's organic

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:25.609 
that's conceded the Olivia's organic
it's<00:01:22.799> spring<00:01:23.790> mix<00:01:24.000> and<00:01:24.750> spinach<00:01:25.229> already

it's spring mix and spinach already
mixed<00:01:25.920> together<00:01:26.040> so<00:01:26.610> I<00:01:26.850> thought<00:01:27.270> that<00:01:27.450> would

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570 
mixed together so I thought that would

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:30.080 
mixed together so I thought that would
be<00:01:27.630> more<00:01:27.930> efficient<00:01:28.439> for<00:01:28.470> me<00:01:28.740> so<00:01:29.400> I<00:01:29.790> purchased

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
be more efficient for me so I purchased

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:36.260 
be more efficient for me so I purchased
this<00:01:30.390> from<00:01:30.509> Whole<00:01:30.750> Foods<00:01:30.780> so<00:01:34.939> I'm<00:01:35.939> just<00:01:36.119> gonna

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270 
this from Whole Foods so I'm just gonna

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:38.359 
this from Whole Foods so I'm just gonna
use<00:01:36.600> three<00:01:36.869> handfuls<00:01:37.200> of<00:01:37.590> this<00:01:37.799> and<00:01:38.100> this<00:01:38.189> is

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:38.369 
use three handfuls of this and this is

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:40.550 
use three handfuls of this and this is
what<00:01:38.520> I'm<00:01:38.640> calling<00:01:38.790> a<00:01:38.970> handful<00:01:39.500> yesterday<00:01:40.500> I

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560 
what I'm calling a handful yesterday I

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:42.020 
what I'm calling a handful yesterday I
was<00:01:40.680> a<00:01:40.770> little<00:01:41.070> heavy-handed<00:01:41.340> with<00:01:41.850> my

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030 
was a little heavy-handed with my

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:45.620 
was a little heavy-handed with my
handful<00:01:42.570> and<00:01:42.869> these<00:01:43.799> were<00:01:43.979> very<00:01:44.009> thick<00:01:44.820> and<00:01:45.570> I

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
handful and these were very thick and I

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:47.270 
handful and these were very thick and I
think<00:01:45.840> it<00:01:45.960> was<00:01:46.079> because<00:01:46.229> I<00:01:46.409> use<00:01:46.649> a<00:01:46.680> lot<00:01:47.009> too

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:47.280 
think it was because I use a lot too

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:49.789 
think it was because I use a lot too
many<00:01:47.460> grains<00:01:47.700> so<00:01:48.509> this<00:01:48.869> is<00:01:49.020> a<00:01:49.049> handful<00:01:49.500> for<00:01:49.560> me

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:49.799 
many grains so this is a handful for me

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:56.940 
many grains so this is a handful for me
