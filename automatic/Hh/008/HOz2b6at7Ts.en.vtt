00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 
make sure that they're not frozen at all

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:52.789 
make sure that they're not frozen at all
because<00:01:50.579> it<00:01:50.939> could<00:01:51.090> hurt<00:01:51.299> the<00:01:51.540> fish<00:01:51.810> if<00:01:52.170> they

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:09.680 
of barely squeeze them and the peas will
pop<00:02:07.409> out<00:02:07.590> and<00:02:07.860> then<00:02:07.979> you'd<00:02:08.129> want<00:02:08.399> to<00:02:08.520> throw<00:02:09.390> the

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:09.690 
pop out and then you'd want to throw the

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:11.270 
pop out and then you'd want to throw the
skins<00:02:10.140> away<00:02:10.470> because

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:11.280 
skins away because

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:13.670 
skins away because
skins<00:02:11.520> are<00:02:11.700> a<00:02:11.730> little<00:02:11.880> bit<00:02:12.030> too<00:02:12.209> tough<00:02:12.810> now

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680 
skins are a little bit too tough now

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:18.140 
skins are a little bit too tough now
what<00:02:13.860> this<00:02:14.069> what<00:02:14.819> the<00:02:14.940> peas<00:02:15.180> do<00:02:15.600> is<00:02:17.150> your

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:18.150 
what this what the peas do is your

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:21.770 
what this what the peas do is your
goldfish<00:02:19.220> specially<00:02:20.220> fantails<00:02:20.790> have<00:02:21.510> the

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:21.780 
goldfish specially fantails have the

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:27.309 
goldfish specially fantails have the
unfortunate<00:02:23.750> design<00:02:24.750> of<00:02:25.110> being<00:02:25.980> completely

00:02:27.309 --> 00:02:27.319 
unfortunate design of being completely

00:02:27.319 --> 00:02:31.760 
unfortunate design of being completely
uh<00:02:28.319> inbred<00:02:29.280> and<00:02:29.550> so<00:02:30.360> their<00:02:30.690> guts<00:02:31.230> are<00:02:31.560> just

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:31.770 
uh inbred and so their guts are just

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:33.590 
uh inbred and so their guts are just
kind<00:02:32.010> of<00:02:32.190> all<00:02:32.400> shoved<00:02:33.030> up<00:02:33.209> in<00:02:33.390> there<00:02:33.569> all

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:33.600 
kind of all shoved up in there all

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:36.380 
kind of all shoved up in there all
tangled<00:02:34.260> and<00:02:34.500> so<00:02:35.010> it's<00:02:35.190> really<00:02:35.370> easy<00:02:35.520> for<00:02:36.209> them

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:36.390 
tangled and so it's really easy for them

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:41.479 
tangled and so it's really easy for them
to<00:02:37.069> get<00:02:38.069> air<00:02:38.400> trapped<00:02:39.239> in<00:02:39.569> their<00:02:40.489> intestines

00:02:41.479 --> 00:02:41.489 
to get air trapped in their intestines

00:02:41.489 --> 00:02:44.000 
to get air trapped in their intestines
and<00:02:41.850> they<00:02:42.330> can't<00:02:42.569> get<00:02:42.750> it<00:02:42.840> out<00:02:42.959> they<00:02:43.260> get<00:02:43.410> they

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:44.010 
and they can't get it out they get they

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:45.880 
and they can't get it out they get they
kind<00:02:44.190> of<00:02:44.250> get<00:02:44.370> constipated<00:02:44.970> hold<00:02:45.450> on<00:02:45.600> a<00:02:45.630> sec

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:45.890 
kind of get constipated hold on a sec

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:48.320 
kind of get constipated hold on a sec
anyway<00:02:46.890> sorry<00:02:47.100> about<00:02:47.400> that<00:02:47.430> my<00:02:47.760> dog<00:02:47.940> was<00:02:48.150> going

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:48.330 
anyway sorry about that my dog was going

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:51.560 
anyway sorry about that my dog was going
nuts<00:02:48.600> okay<00:02:49.470> so<00:02:49.769> anyway<00:02:50.190> as<00:02:50.310> I<00:02:50.430> was<00:02:50.459> saying<00:02:50.820> they

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:51.570 
nuts okay so anyway as I was saying they

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:54.440 
nuts okay so anyway as I was saying they
can<00:02:51.930> get<00:02:52.110> constipated<00:02:52.890> and<00:02:53.250> so<00:02:53.940> what<00:02:54.090> the<00:02:54.209> peas

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:54.450 
can get constipated and so what the peas

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:58.640 
can get constipated and so what the peas
do<00:02:54.690> is<00:02:54.840> they<00:02:54.989> act<00:02:55.170> as<00:02:55.470> like<00:02:55.709> a<00:02:57.200> roughage<00:02:58.200> to

00:02:58.640 --> 00:02:58.650 
do is they act as like a roughage to

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:02.330 
do is they act as like a roughage to
clean<00:02:59.130> them<00:02:59.250> out<00:02:59.370> and<00:03:00.470> that'll<00:03:01.470> let<00:03:01.950> them<00:03:02.100> pass

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:02.340 
clean them out and that'll let them pass

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:06.590 
clean them out and that'll let them pass
their<00:03:03.680> feces<00:03:04.680> and<00:03:05.069> then<00:03:05.130> also<00:03:05.430> pass<00:03:05.880> any<00:03:06.269> air

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:06.600 
their feces and then also pass any air

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:09.740 
their feces and then also pass any air
that's<00:03:06.900> trapped<00:03:06.989> in<00:03:07.380> there<00:03:07.530> too<00:03:07.739> so<00:03:08.750> they

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:09.750 
that's trapped in there too so they

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:11.059 
that's trapped in there too so they
won't<00:03:09.870> have<00:03:09.989> the<00:03:10.170> swim<00:03:10.350> bladder<00:03:10.620> problem

00:03:11.059 --> 00:03:11.069 
won't have the swim bladder problem

00:03:11.069 --> 00:03:13.220 
won't have the swim bladder problem
anymore<00:03:11.370> they<00:03:11.519> won't<00:03:11.610> be<00:03:11.760> stuck<00:03:12.030> at<00:03:12.840> the<00:03:13.050> top

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:13.230 
anymore they won't be stuck at the top

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:18.050

00:03:48.319 --> 00:03:48.329 
really have a chance to get a blockage

really have a chance to get a blockage
and<00:03:48.630> you<00:03:48.959> should<00:03:50.900> have<00:03:51.900> some<00:03:52.200> pretty<00:03:52.410> healthy

00:03:52.789 --> 00:03:52.799 
and you should have some pretty healthy

00:03:52.799 --> 00:04:09.830 
and you should have some pretty healthy
fish<00:03:52.980> because<00:03:53.430> they<00:03:54.200> love<00:03:55.200> their<00:03:55.470> greens

00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:09.840 

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:14.480 

my<00:04:10.840> dog<00:04:11.080> is<00:04:11.110> still<00:04:11.500> freaking<00:04:11.950> out<00:04:12.810> so<00:04:13.810> anyway

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:14.490 
my dog is still freaking out so anyway

00:04:14.490 --> 00:04:17.130 
my dog is still freaking out so anyway
that's<00:04:15.490> just<00:04:15.670> a<00:04:15.910> little<00:04:16.120> quick<00:04:16.300> something<00:04:16.810> if

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:17.140 
that's just a little quick something if

00:04:17.140 --> 00:04:20.700 
that's just a little quick something if
all<00:04:17.500> those<00:04:17.770> things<00:04:17.830> don't<00:04:18.370> work<00:04:19.290> you<00:04:20.290> should

00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:20.710 
all those things don't work you should

00:04:20.710 --> 00:04:23.340 
all those things don't work you should
probably<00:04:21.070> maybe<00:04:21.820> look<00:04:22.240> into<00:04:22.570> some<00:04:22.810> medicine

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:23.350 
probably maybe look into some medicine

00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:26.280 
probably maybe look into some medicine
getting<00:04:24.160> the<00:04:24.520> sick<00:04:25.180> fish<00:04:25.450> into<00:04:25.840> a<00:04:25.870> tank

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:26.290 
getting the sick fish into a tank

00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:27.750 
getting the sick fish into a tank
because<00:04:26.710> it<00:04:26.860> might<00:04:27.010> be<00:04:27.130> something<00:04:27.460> a<00:04:27.550> little

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:27.760 
because it might be something a little

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:31.220 
because it might be something a little
bit<00:04:27.880> more<00:04:27.910> than<00:04:28.240> just<00:04:28.420> air<00:04:28.690> is<00:04:28.960> stuck<00:04:29.910> but

00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:31.230 
bit more than just air is stuck but

00:04:31.230 --> 00:04:36.750 
bit more than just air is stuck but
usually<00:04:32.230> this<00:04:32.410> does<00:04:32.650> the<00:04:32.830> trick<00:04:32.860> and<00:04:35.760> they

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:36.760 
usually this does the trick and they

00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:37.350 
usually this does the trick and they
love<00:04:37.030> it

00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:37.360 
love it

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:40.920 
love it
the<00:04:37.480> little<00:04:37.900> treats<00:04:38.200> for<00:04:38.320> the<00:04:38.530> babies
