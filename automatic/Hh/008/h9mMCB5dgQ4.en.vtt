00:07:13.830 --> 00:07:16.730 
process I'm actually not going to go
through<00:07:14.070> the<00:07:14.250> entire<00:07:14.340> process<00:07:14.930> for<00:07:15.930> the<00:07:16.500> sake

00:07:16.730 --> 00:07:16.740 
through the entire process for the sake

00:07:16.740 --> 00:07:18.950 
through the entire process for the sake
of<00:07:16.770> time<00:07:17.220> in<00:07:17.490> this<00:07:17.670> video<00:07:18.030> if<00:07:18.330> you<00:07:18.750> guys

00:07:18.950 --> 00:07:18.960 
of time in this video if you guys

00:07:18.960 --> 00:07:21.410 
of time in this video if you guys
actually<00:07:19.290> get<00:07:19.650> an<00:07:19.770> air<00:07:20.100> towards<00:07:20.610> the<00:07:20.700> very<00:07:21.240> end

00:07:21.410 --> 00:07:21.420 
actually get an air towards the very end

00:07:21.420 --> 00:07:23.390 
actually get an air towards the very end
of<00:07:21.780> your<00:07:21.930> restore<00:07:22.560> and<00:07:22.680> it<00:07:22.770> looked<00:07:23.070> like<00:07:23.130> it

00:07:23.390 --> 00:07:23.400 
of your restore and it looked like it

00:07:23.400 --> 00:07:25.460 
of your restore and it looked like it
was<00:07:23.520> almost<00:07:24.030> about<00:07:24.240> to<00:07:24.360> complete<00:07:24.900> but<00:07:25.140> then<00:07:25.350> it

00:07:25.460 --> 00:07:25.470 
was almost about to complete but then it

00:07:25.470 --> 00:07:27.590 
was almost about to complete but then it
gives<00:07:25.590> you<00:07:25.770> an<00:07:25.890> error<00:07:26.130> message<00:07:26.400> and<00:07:26.820> it<00:07:27.300> just

00:07:27.590 --> 00:07:27.600 
gives you an error message and it just

00:07:27.600 --> 00:07:30.140 
gives you an error message and it just
puts<00:07:27.840> your<00:07:28.050> iPhone<00:07:28.470> iPad<00:07:28.860> or<00:07:28.920> iPod<00:07:29.070> Touch<00:07:29.640> into

00:07:30.140 --> 00:07:30.150

puts your iPhone iPad or iPod Touch into
recovery<00:07:30.780> mode<00:07:30.870> and<00:07:31.260> basically<00:07:31.950> you<00:07:32.130> can't

00:07:32.390 --> 00:07:32.400 
recovery mode and basically you can't

00:07:32.400 --> 00:07:33.650

get<00:07:32.580> it<00:07:32.610> out<00:07:32.760> of<00:07:32.820> recovery<00:07:33.180> mode<00:07:33.450> and<00:07:33.570> it's

00:07:33.650 --> 00:07:33.660 
get it out of recovery mode and it's

00:07:33.660 --> 00:07:35.960
