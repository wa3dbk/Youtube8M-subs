magnum 10kt it's new for 2011 and it

00:00:15.039 --> 00:00:17.269 
magnum 10kt it's new for 2011 and it
really<00:00:15.279> is<00:00:15.490> a<00:00:15.520> next-generation<00:00:15.969> switch<00:00:16.900> and

00:00:17.269 --> 00:00:17.279 
really is a next-generation switch and

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:19.290 
really is a next-generation switch and
the<00:00:18.279> biggest<00:00:18.460> reason<00:00:18.789> it's<00:00:19.180> a

00:00:19.290 --> 00:00:19.300 
the biggest reason it's a

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:21.720 
the biggest reason it's a
next-generation<00:00:19.810> switch<00:00:20.439> is<00:00:20.710> the<00:00:21.490> dual

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:21.730 
next-generation switch is the dual

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:24.330 
next-generation switch is the dual
hot-swappable<00:00:22.420> power<00:00:22.840> supplies<00:00:23.350> which

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:24.340 
hot-swappable power supplies which

00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:26.820 
hot-swappable power supplies which

the switch life is good suddenly a power

00:00:50.409 --> 00:00:52.860 
the switch life is good suddenly a power
supply<00:00:50.679> goes<00:00:51.069> bad<00:00:51.339> so<00:00:52.059> as<00:00:52.149> we<00:00:52.299> rotate<00:00:52.539> around

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:52.870 
supply goes bad so as we rotate around

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:55.649 
supply goes bad so as we rotate around
to<00:00:53.199> the<00:00:53.289> back<00:00:53.499> I<00:00:53.829> will<00:00:54.760> simulate<00:00:55.179> a<00:00:55.420> power

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:55.659 
to the back I will simulate a power

00:00:55.659 --> 00:01:00.899 
to the back I will simulate a power
failure<00:00:56.969> the<00:00:57.969> power<00:00:58.209> supply<00:00:58.449> comes<00:00:58.899> out<00:00:59.639> so<00:01:00.639> we

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:00.909 
failure the power supply comes out so we

00:01:00.909 --> 00:01:02.729 
failure the power supply comes out so we
go<00:01:01.059> to<00:01:01.120> the<00:01:01.329> power<00:01:01.539> supply<00:01:01.780> screen<00:01:02.319> on<00:01:02.559> the

00:01:02.729 --> 00:01:02.739 
go to the power supply screen on the

00:01:02.739 --> 00:01:06.080 
go to the power supply screen on the
management<00:01:03.100> interface<00:01:03.699> and<00:01:04.350> it's<00:01:05.350> gone<00:01:05.590> red

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
management interface and it's gone red

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:09.600 
management interface and it's gone red
so<00:01:07.090> you<00:01:07.150> see<00:01:07.600> it's<00:01:07.750> gone<00:01:07.960> red<00:01:08.260> and<00:01:08.560> what<00:01:09.280> to<00:01:09.430> do

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:09.610 
so you see it's gone red and what to do

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:12.000 
so you see it's gone red and what to do
well<00:01:10.000> we<00:01:10.270> can<00:01:10.420> still<00:01:10.630> get<00:01:10.750> information<00:01:11.440> for

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:12.010 
well we can still get information for

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:13.740 
well we can still get information for
example<00:01:12.430> we<00:01:12.520> can<00:01:12.670> see<00:01:12.730> that<00:01:13.120> it's<00:01:13.270> gone<00:01:13.420> red

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:13.750 
example we can see that it's gone red

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:16.500 
example we can see that it's gone red
one<00:01:14.170> of<00:01:14.290> the<00:01:14.380> two<00:01:14.530> power<00:01:14.740> supplies<00:01:15.060> but<00:01:16.060> the

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:16.510 
one of the two power supplies but the

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:17.910 
one of the two power supplies but the
switch<00:01:16.780> can<00:01:16.990> still<00:01:17.260> provide<00:01:17.560> all<00:01:17.800> the

00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:17.920 
switch can still provide all the

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:19.500 
switch can still provide all the
information<00:01:18.040> and<00:01:18.580> do<00:01:18.760> everything<00:01:19.000> you<00:01:19.480> want

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:19.510 
information and do everything you want

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:22.290 
information and do everything you want
it<00:01:19.870> to<00:01:19.900> do<00:01:20.190> but<00:01:21.190> you<00:01:21.400> don't<00:01:21.610> have<00:01:21.670> the<00:01:21.790> comfort

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:22.300 
it to do but you don't have the comfort

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:25.110 
it to do but you don't have the comfort
of<00:01:22.450> having<00:01:22.780> a<00:01:23.110> redundant<00:01:23.710> power<00:01:23.920> supply<00:01:24.370> so<00:01:25.000> we

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:25.120 
of having a redundant power supply so we

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:27.480 
of having a redundant power supply so we
put<00:01:25.360> back<00:01:25.510> in<00:01:25.720> a<00:01:25.750> good<00:01:25.990> power<00:01:26.230> supply<00:01:26.680> to<00:01:26.920> give

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:27.490 
put back in a good power supply to give

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:31.260 
put back in a good power supply to give
you<00:01:27.580> the<00:01:27.760> redundancy<00:01:28.470> plug<00:01:29.470> it<00:01:29.590> in<00:01:29.740> and<00:01:30.240> take<00:01:31.240> a

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:31.270 
you the redundancy plug it in and take a

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:35.040 
you the redundancy plug it in and take a
look<00:01:31.450> now<00:01:32.970> you<00:01:33.970> have<00:01:34.270> the<00:01:34.390> redundancy<00:01:35.020> that

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:35.050 
look now you have the redundancy that

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:37.200 
look now you have the redundancy that
you<00:01:35.500> have<00:01:36.190> come<00:01:36.460> to<00:01:36.490> know<00:01:36.610> in<00:01:36.850> love<00:01:37.030> with

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:45.150 
mission critical environments so if you
look<00:01:43.030> at<00:01:43.210> it<00:01:43.420> both<00:01:43.840> of<00:01:44.170> the<00:01:44.410> power<00:01:44.710> supplies

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:45.160 
look at it both of the power supplies

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:47.640 
look at it both of the power supplies
they're<00:01:45.910> up<00:01:46.120> and<00:01:46.270> running<00:01:46.330> in<00:01:46.750> your<00:01:47.140> up<00:01:47.440> with

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:47.650 
they're up and running in your up with

00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:50.490 
they're up and running in your up with
redundancy<00:01:48.159> there<00:01:48.970> has<00:01:49.180> been<00:01:49.420> no<00:01:49.810> network

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:50.500 
redundancy there has been no network

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:52.980 
redundancy there has been no network
downtime<00:01:51.030> well<00:01:52.030> one<00:01:52.240> of<00:01:52.360> the<00:01:52.420> power<00:01:52.600> supplies

00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:52.990 
downtime well one of the power supplies

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:56.370 
downtime well one of the power supplies
was<00:01:53.200> down<00:01:53.440> and<00:01:53.790> none<00:01:54.790> while<00:01:55.659> the<00:01:55.780> replacement

00:01:56.370 --> 00:01:56.380 
was down and none while the replacement

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:58.980 
was down and none while the replacement
power<00:01:56.530> supply<00:01:56.770> was<00:01:57.100> inserted<00:01:57.730> so<00:01:58.600> the<00:01:58.750> power

00:01:58.980 --> 00:01:58.990 
power supply was inserted so the power

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:01.200 
power supply was inserted so the power
supply<00:01:59.350> has<00:01:59.830> been<00:01:59.890> replaced<00:02:00.550> in<00:02:00.820> a<00:02:00.909> matter<00:02:01.120> of

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:01.210 
supply has been replaced in a matter of

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:03.870 
supply has been replaced in a matter of
seconds<00:02:01.840> and<00:02:02.140> we're<00:02:02.710> back<00:02:02.950> up<00:02:03.190> with<00:02:03.370> redundant

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:03.880 
seconds and we're back up with redundant

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:07.080 
seconds and we're back up with redundant
power<00:02:04.000> supplies<00:02:04.500> so<00:02:05.500> if<00:02:05.860> you<00:02:06.220> look<00:02:06.490> at<00:02:06.820> the

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:07.090 
power supplies so if you look at the

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:10.680 
power supplies so if you look at the
monitor<00:02:07.570> you<00:02:08.560> will<00:02:08.679> notice<00:02:08.950> that<00:02:09.819> you've<00:02:10.479> got

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:10.690 
monitor you will notice that you've got

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:14.339 
monitor you will notice that you've got
two<00:02:10.959> good<00:02:11.290> arms<00:02:11.560> screens<00:02:12.250> and<00:02:12.930> there<00:02:13.930> has<00:02:14.109> been

00:02:14.339 --> 00:02:14.349 
two good arms screens and there has been
