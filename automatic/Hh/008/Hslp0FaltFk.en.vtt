00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:12.290 
some of the world's best players in our
town<00:03:08.940> there's<00:03:09.420> people<00:03:09.930> like<00:03:10.220> share<00:03:11.220> of<00:03:11.400> my

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:12.300 
town there's people like share of my

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:15.290 
town there's people like share of my
clackamas<00:03:12.900> knew<00:03:13.500> I<00:03:13.800> don't<00:03:14.520> just<00:03:14.760> have<00:03:15.000> them<00:03:15.180> in

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:15.300 
clackamas knew I don't just have them in

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:17.270 
clackamas knew I don't just have them in
any<00:03:15.450> tournament<00:03:15.720> and<00:03:16.170> so<00:03:16.410> I<00:03:16.680> think<00:03:17.070> that

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:17.280 
any tournament and so I think that

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:19.910 
any tournament and so I think that
really<00:03:17.520> makes<00:03:18.270> the<00:03:18.450> stern<00:03:18.630> special<00:03:19.170> and<00:03:19.350> the

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:19.920 
really makes the stern special and the

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:20.870 
really makes the stern special and the
fact<00:03:20.130> that<00:03:20.220> they're<00:03:20.460> playing<00:03:20.820> very

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:20.880 
fact that they're playing very

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:24.200 
fact that they're playing very
interesting<00:03:21.420> games<00:03:21.660> against<00:03:22.760> top<00:03:23.760> Canadian

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:24.210 
interesting games against top Canadian

00:03:24.210 --> 00:03:26.330 
interesting games against top Canadian
players<00:03:24.480> as<00:03:24.690> well<00:03:24.720> as<00:03:24.990> somatic<00:03:25.590> grandmasters

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:26.340 
players as well as somatic grandmasters

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:30.560 
players as well as somatic grandmasters
brings<00:03:27.230> good<00:03:28.230> crowds<00:03:28.590> and<00:03:29.010> I<00:03:29.940> think<00:03:30.420> people

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:30.570 
brings good crowds and I think people

00:03:30.570 --> 00:03:33.230 
brings good crowds and I think people
are<00:03:30.810> enjoying<00:03:31.080> it<00:03:31.320> a<00:03:31.410> lot<00:03:31.700> in<00:03:32.700> general<00:03:33.090> though

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:33.240 
are enjoying it a lot in general though

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:35.810 
are enjoying it a lot in general though
a<00:03:33.600> very<00:03:34.020> good<00:03:34.200> tournament<00:03:34.620> and<00:03:35.160> I<00:03:35.580> will

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:35.820 
a very good tournament and I will

00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:39.650 
a very good tournament and I will
definitely<00:03:36.030> be<00:03:36.870> going<00:03:37.050> to<00:03:37.320> the<00:03:37.410> next
