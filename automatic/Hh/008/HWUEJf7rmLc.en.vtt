Deluxe's the claw can actually lock into
place<00:00:27.310> you<00:00:28.240> push<00:00:28.420> it<00:00:28.570> all<00:00:28.720> the<00:00:28.929> way<00:00:29.019> down<00:00:29.050> and

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:29.470 
place you push it all the way down and

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:32.010 
place you push it all the way down and
you'll<00:00:29.560> feel<00:00:29.740> this<00:00:29.920> click<00:00:30.460> and<00:00:30.869> then<00:00:31.869> it'll

00:00:32.010 --> 00:00:32.020 
you'll feel this click and then it'll

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:34.310 
you'll feel this click and then it'll
just<00:00:32.140> stay<00:00:32.619> and<00:00:33.129> then<00:00:33.460> you<00:00:33.579> just<00:00:33.820> kind<00:00:34.120> of

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:34.320 
just stay and then you just kind of

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:38.850 
just stay and then you just kind of
force<00:00:35.320> it<00:00:35.530> back<00:00:36.690> so<00:00:37.690> yeah<00:00:38.410> you<00:00:38.469> got<00:00:38.739> this

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:38.860 
force it back so yeah you got this

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:41.610 
force it back so yeah you got this
little<00:00:39.100> claw<00:00:39.340> thing<00:00:39.640> going<00:00:40.000> I<00:00:40.239> don't<00:00:40.960> like<00:00:41.410> the

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:41.620 
little claw thing going I don't like the

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:44.069 
little claw thing going I don't like the
claw<00:00:41.890> I<00:00:42.190> think<00:00:42.520> it's<00:00:42.640> kind<00:00:42.850> of<00:00:42.910> dumb<00:00:43.180> it<00:00:43.809> worked

00:00:44.069 --> 00:00:44.079 
claw I think it's kind of dumb it worked

00:00:44.079 --> 00:00:47.549 
claw I think it's kind of dumb it worked
so<00:00:44.590> much<00:00:44.800> better<00:00:45.070> on<00:00:45.160> crankcase<00:00:46.020> but<00:00:47.020> that's

00:00:47.549 --> 00:00:47.559 
so much better on crankcase but that's

00:00:47.559 --> 00:00:49.470 
so much better on crankcase but that's
just<00:00:47.739> my<00:00:47.920> opinion<00:00:47.949> so<00:00:48.820> we'll<00:00:49.030> put<00:00:49.180> that<00:00:49.210> off<00:00:49.449> to

00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:49.480 
just my opinion so we'll put that off to

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:50.819 
just my opinion so we'll put that off to
the<00:00:49.690> side<00:00:49.870> and<00:00:50.020> take<00:00:50.170> a<00:00:50.199> look<00:00:50.440> at<00:00:50.500> the<00:00:50.590> figure

00:00:50.819 --> 00:00:50.829 
the side and take a look at the figure

00:00:50.829 --> 00:00:54.299 
the side and take a look at the figure
itself<00:00:51.510> the<00:00:52.510> figure<00:00:52.750> itself<00:00:52.899> is<00:00:53.260> the<00:00:53.710> typical

00:00:54.299 --> 00:00:54.309 
itself the figure itself is the typical

00:00:54.309 --> 00:00:57.660 
itself the figure itself is the typical
Ford<00:00:54.670> Mustang<00:00:55.180> police<00:00:55.629> car<00:00:55.930> it<00:00:56.170> still<00:00:56.920> has<00:00:57.160> to

00:00:57.660 --> 00:00:57.670 
Ford Mustang police car it still has to

00:00:57.670 --> 00:01:00.599 
Ford Mustang police car it still has to
punish<00:00:57.879> and<00:00:58.149> enslave<00:00:58.510> on<00:00:58.719> the<00:00:58.809> back<00:00:58.989> sides<00:00:59.890> and

00:01:00.599 --> 00:01:00.609 
punish and enslave on the back sides and

00:01:00.609 --> 00:01:01.889 
punish and enslave on the back sides and
it's<00:01:00.760> modelled<00:01:01.120> and<00:01:01.239> all<00:01:01.329> black<00:01:01.570> with<00:01:01.870> a

00:01:01.889 --> 00:01:01.899 
it's modelled and all black with a

00:01:01.899 --> 00:01:03.450 
it's modelled and all black with a
little<00:01:02.050> bit<00:01:02.289> of<00:01:02.350> white<00:01:02.530> now<00:01:03.190> what's

00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:03.460 
little bit of white now what's

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:05.250 
little bit of white now what's
interesting<00:01:03.609> is<00:01:04.180> the<00:01:04.390> transformation<00:01:04.870> the

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:05.260 
interesting is the transformation the

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:08.880 
interesting is the transformation the
transformation<00:01:05.310> is<00:01:07.320> definitely<00:01:08.320> different<00:01:08.620> I

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:08.890 
transformation is definitely different I

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:10.800 
transformation is definitely different I
mean<00:01:09.040> this<00:01:09.160> is<00:01:09.340> definitely<00:01:09.760> a<00:01:09.940> change<00:01:10.330> from

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:10.810 
mean this is definitely a change from

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:13.440 
mean this is definitely a change from
what<00:01:11.680> we've<00:01:11.860> seen<00:01:12.070> before<00:01:12.280> we're<00:01:13.150> going<00:01:13.330> to

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:13.450 
what we've seen before we're going to

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:15.300 
what we've seen before we're going to
start<00:01:13.660> off<00:01:13.780> by<00:01:13.810> coming<00:01:14.200> in<00:01:14.380> on<00:01:14.530> the<00:01:14.620> sides<00:01:14.890> and

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:15.310 
start off by coming in on the sides and

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:17.610 
start off by coming in on the sides and
popping<00:01:16.000> the<00:01:16.090> doors<00:01:16.330> off<00:01:16.690> now<00:01:16.930> that<00:01:17.140> isn't

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:17.620 
popping the doors off now that isn't

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:19.350 
popping the doors off now that isn't
different<00:01:18.280> not<00:01:18.520> going<00:01:18.670> to<00:01:18.730> lie<00:01:18.880> there<00:01:19.090> and

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:19.360 
different not going to lie there and

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:24.330 
different not going to lie there and
we'll<00:01:20.080> just<00:01:20.260> fold<00:01:20.530> up<00:01:20.740> the<00:01:22.290> the<00:01:23.340> windshields

00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:35.920 
next we'll come back to the bit rear

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:37.560 
next we'll come back to the bit rear
bumper<00:01:36.280> and<00:01:36.310> just<00:01:36.670> fold<00:01:36.910> that<00:01:37.090> completely

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:37.570 
bumper and just fold that completely

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:39.120 
bumper and just fold that completely
upward<00:01:38.110> and<00:01:38.350> then<00:01:38.530> we'll<00:01:38.620> take<00:01:38.770> the<00:01:38.950> whole

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:39.130 
upward and then we'll take the whole

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:41.640 
upward and then we'll take the whole
back<00:01:39.640> window<00:01:40.270> part<00:01:40.630> along<00:01:41.080> with<00:01:41.140> the<00:01:41.260> bumper

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:41.650 
back window part along with the bumper

00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:43.800 
back window part along with the bumper
and<00:01:42.370> unpack<00:01:42.910> it<00:01:42.940> from<00:01:43.270> the<00:01:43.390> top<00:01:43.600> of<00:01:43.750> the

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:43.810 
and unpack it from the top of the

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:46.530 
and unpack it from the top of the
vehicle<00:01:44.170> and<00:01:44.290> fold<00:01:44.650> it<00:01:44.800> down<00:01:44.830> and<00:01:45.550> this<00:01:46.240> will

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:46.540 
vehicle and fold it down and this will

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:49.290 
vehicle and fold it down and this will
pull<00:01:46.780> out<00:01:47.080> what<00:01:47.380> will<00:01:47.530> be<00:01:47.680> the<00:01:47.950> robot<00:01:48.280> legs<00:01:48.640> and

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:49.300 
pull out what will be the robot legs and

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:50.550 
pull out what will be the robot legs and
we'll<00:01:49.420> go<00:01:49.540> ahead<00:01:49.630> and<00:01:49.840> fence<00:01:50.020> with<00:01:50.170> that<00:01:50.320> now

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:50.560 
we'll go ahead and fence with that now

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:53.550 
we'll go ahead and fence with that now
so<00:01:51.490> the<00:01:52.390> robot<00:01:52.750> legs<00:01:52.960> are<00:01:53.170> a<00:01:53.200> little<00:01:53.380> bit

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:53.560 
so the robot legs are a little bit

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:54.810 
so the robot legs are a little bit
interesting<00:01:54.070> this<00:01:54.190> time<00:01:54.430> we're<00:01:54.670> going<00:01:54.760> to

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:54.820 
interesting this time we're going to

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:57.150 
interesting this time we're going to
take<00:01:55.240> this<00:01:55.390> whole<00:01:55.660> section<00:01:56.230> that<00:01:56.260> folded<00:01:57.010> down

00:01:57.150 --> 00:01:57.160 
take this whole section that folded down

00:01:57.160 --> 00:02:00.750 
take this whole section that folded down
and<00:01:57.220> flip<00:01:57.730> it<00:01:57.790> around<00:01:58.170> 180<00:01:59.170> degrees<00:01:59.500> and<00:02:00.250> then

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:00.760 
and flip it around 180 degrees and then

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:02.610 
and flip it around 180 degrees and then
plug<00:02:01.120> it<00:02:01.240> back<00:02:01.270> up<00:02:01.630> into<00:02:01.870> the<00:02:02.080> center<00:02:02.350> of<00:02:02.380> the

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:02.620 
plug it back up into the center of the

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:05.120 
plug it back up into the center of the
figure<00:02:02.800> then<00:02:03.730> we'll<00:02:03.880> fold<00:02:04.090> the<00:02:04.270> feet<00:02:04.450> down

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:05.130 
figure then we'll fold the feet down

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:07.830 
figure then we'll fold the feet down
pull<00:02:06.130> out<00:02:06.370> the<00:02:06.550> legs<00:02:06.760> now<00:02:07.000> the<00:02:07.060> legs<00:02:07.360> don't

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:07.840 
pull out the legs now the legs don't

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:13.920 
pull out the legs now the legs don't
really<00:02:10.200> sit<00:02:11.200> at<00:02:11.440> 90<00:02:12.370> degrees<00:02:12.760> there<00:02:13.240> the

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:13.930 
really sit at 90 degrees there the

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:16.920 
really sit at 90 degrees there the
on<00:02:14.609> swivel<00:02:15.609> joints<00:02:16.030> which<00:02:16.299> are<00:02:16.420> then<00:02:16.569> attached

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:16.930 
on swivel joints which are then attached

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:18.809 
on swivel joints which are then attached
to<00:02:17.109> bowl<00:02:17.409> joints<00:02:17.890> in<00:02:18.040> the<00:02:18.129> top<00:02:18.340> of<00:02:18.519> the<00:02:18.579> legs

00:02:18.809 --> 00:02:18.819 
to bowl joints in the top of the legs

00:02:18.819 --> 00:02:22.500 
to bowl joints in the top of the legs
I'll<00:02:19.750> talk<00:02:20.620> about<00:02:20.650> that<00:02:21.159> in<00:02:21.340> a<00:02:21.400> bit<00:02:21.430> as<00:02:21.849> it

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:22.510 
I'll talk about that in a bit as it

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:26.640 
I'll talk about that in a bit as it
causes<00:02:23.170> a<00:02:23.439> few<00:02:24.189> minor<00:02:24.819> issues<00:02:25.599> oh<00:02:25.870> and<00:02:26.560> the

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:26.650 
causes a few minor issues oh and the

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:28.649 
causes a few minor issues oh and the
feet<00:02:27.099> have<00:02:27.310> a<00:02:27.340> tendency<00:02:27.819> to<00:02:27.909> pop<00:02:28.090> off<00:02:28.359> if<00:02:28.569> you

00:02:28.649 --> 00:02:28.659 
feet have a tendency to pop off if you

00:02:28.659 --> 00:02:29.970 
feet have a tendency to pop off if you
push<00:02:28.870> them<00:02:28.959> too<00:02:29.140> far<00:02:29.319> but<00:02:29.409> they<00:02:29.530> go<00:02:29.620> right<00:02:29.769> back

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:29.980 
push them too far but they go right back

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:33.720 
push them too far but they go right back
in<00:02:30.159> so<00:02:31.060> for<00:02:31.420> the<00:02:31.480> top<00:02:31.719> of<00:02:31.930> the<00:02:32.019> figure<00:02:32.730> we're

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:33.730 
in so for the top of the figure we're

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:37.619 
in so for the top of the figure we're
going<00:02:33.939> to<00:02:34.030> actually<00:02:34.540> just<00:02:35.519> kind<00:02:36.519> of<00:02:36.579> snap<00:02:37.389> the

00:02:37.619 --> 00:02:37.629 
going to actually just kind of snap the

00:02:37.629 --> 00:02:40.440 
going to actually just kind of snap the
hood<00:02:37.810> down<00:02:38.370> one<00:02:39.370> thing<00:02:39.400> cool<00:02:39.819> about<00:02:40.060> the<00:02:40.239> hood

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:40.450 
hood down one thing cool about the hood

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:42.240 
hood down one thing cool about the hood
is<00:02:40.959> if<00:02:41.200> you<00:02:41.290> take<00:02:41.469> the<00:02:41.620> very<00:02:41.769> front<00:02:42.129> of<00:02:42.189> the

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:42.250 
is if you take the very front of the

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:44.819 
is if you take the very front of the
hood<00:02:42.310> you<00:02:43.269> can<00:02:43.329> just<00:02:43.569> rotate<00:02:44.019> it<00:02:44.049> around<00:02:44.260> and

00:02:44.819 --> 00:02:44.829 
hood you can just rotate it around and

00:02:44.829 --> 00:02:47.670 
hood you can just rotate it around and
it<00:02:44.889> will<00:02:44.950> form<00:02:45.280> snarly<00:02:45.909> face<00:02:46.120> hood<00:02:46.530> if<00:02:47.530> you

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:47.680 
it will form snarly face hood if you

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:50.899 
it will form snarly face hood if you
rotate<00:02:48.099> that<00:02:48.310> down<00:02:48.760> that<00:02:49.239> will<00:02:49.450> actually<00:02:49.750> peg

00:02:50.899 --> 00:02:50.909 
rotate that down that will actually peg

00:02:50.909 --> 00:02:53.640 
rotate that down that will actually peg
actually<00:02:51.909> what<00:02:52.419> we<00:02:52.510> do<00:02:52.659> is<00:02:52.870> we<00:02:53.079> fold<00:02:53.349> it<00:02:53.470> all

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:53.650 
actually what we do is we fold it all

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:55.559 
actually what we do is we fold it all
the<00:02:53.680> way<00:02:53.769> back<00:02:54.040> and<00:02:54.340> then<00:02:54.669> we<00:02:54.939> fold<00:02:55.209> it<00:02:55.359> down

00:02:55.559 --> 00:02:55.569 
the way back and then we fold it down

00:02:55.569 --> 00:02:57.780 
the way back and then we fold it down
and<00:02:55.900> the<00:02:56.470> bottom<00:02:56.859> of<00:02:56.980> the<00:02:57.069> front<00:02:57.400> of<00:02:57.489> the<00:02:57.549> hood

00:02:57.780 --> 00:02:57.790 
and the bottom of the front of the hood

00:02:57.790 --> 00:02:59.789 
and the bottom of the front of the hood
or<00:02:58.389> the<00:02:58.540> front<00:02:58.750> of<00:02:58.810> the<00:02:58.900> car<00:02:59.109> will<00:02:59.319> peg<00:02:59.530> into

00:02:59.789 --> 00:02:59.799 
or the front of the car will peg into

00:02:59.799 --> 00:03:03.720 
or the front of the car will peg into
this<00:02:59.919> peg<00:03:00.250> point<00:03:00.700> peg<00:03:00.969> here<00:03:02.159> after<00:03:03.159> we<00:03:03.280> get

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:03.730 
this peg point peg here after we get

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:05.459 
this peg point peg here after we get
everything<00:03:04.209> like<00:03:04.419> up<00:03:04.629> and<00:03:04.840> I<00:03:05.109> completely

arms<00:03:10.419> lined<00:03:10.719> up<00:03:12.540> the<00:03:13.540> rear<00:03:13.840> the<00:03:14.680> windshields

00:03:15.539 --> 00:03:15.549 
arms lined up the rear the windshields

00:03:15.549 --> 00:03:17.339 
arms lined up the rear the windshields
and<00:03:15.760> the<00:03:15.969> windshields<00:03:16.659> the<00:03:16.750> windows<00:03:17.049> out<00:03:17.230> of

supposed to pop off but mine does pops
kind<00:03:27.129> of<00:03:27.190> out<00:03:27.340> and<00:03:27.729> then<00:03:28.329> you<00:03:28.419> can<00:03:28.629> pose<00:03:29.590> this

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:30.250 
kind of out and then you can pose this

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:36.780 
kind of out and then you can pose this
part<00:03:30.609> of<00:03:30.879> the<00:03:32.099> of<00:03:33.099> the<00:03:34.859> wheels<00:03:35.859> at<00:03:36.280> any<00:03:36.549> way<00:03:36.729> you

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:36.790 
part of the of the wheels at any way you

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:39.059 
part of the of the wheels at any way you
want<00:03:37.150> you<00:03:38.139> just<00:03:38.169> get<00:03:38.439> them<00:03:38.560> out<00:03:38.739> of<00:03:38.829> the<00:03:38.919> way<00:03:39.010> so

00:03:39.059 --> 00:03:39.069 
want you just get them out of the way so

00:03:39.069 --> 00:03:44.550 
want you just get them out of the way so
you<00:03:39.280> get<00:03:39.579> some<00:03:39.760> pose<00:03:39.939> ability<00:03:41.489> so<00:03:43.349> there<00:03:44.349> we

00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:44.560 
you get some pose ability so there we

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:46.140 
you get some pose ability so there we
have<00:03:44.769> his<00:03:45.129> robot<00:03:45.669> mode

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:46.150 
have his robot mode

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:48.479 
have his robot mode
and<00:03:46.239> he<00:03:46.540> can<00:03:46.659> actually<00:03:46.989> hold<00:03:47.139> his<00:03:47.290> gun<00:03:47.489> his

00:03:48.479 --> 00:03:48.489 
and he can actually hold his gun his

00:03:48.489 --> 00:03:51.509 
and he can actually hold his gun his
hands<00:03:49.389> are<00:03:49.720> modelled<00:03:50.590> steps<00:03:51.009> that<00:03:51.220> he<00:03:51.340> can't

00:03:51.509 --> 00:03:51.519 
hands are modelled steps that he can't

00:03:51.519 --> 00:03:54.659 
hands are modelled steps that he can't
hold<00:03:51.639> his<00:03:51.849> gun<00:03:52.000> but<00:03:52.239> the<00:03:52.359> gun<00:03:52.540> is<00:03:52.720> a<00:03:53.519> little<00:03:54.519> bit

00:03:54.659 --> 00:03:54.669 
hold his gun but the gun is a little bit

00:03:54.669 --> 00:03:56.610 
hold his gun but the gun is a little bit
out<00:03:54.790> of<00:03:54.819> proportion<00:03:55.449> and<00:03:55.569> for<00:03:55.959> dogs<00:03:56.319> class

00:03:56.610 --> 00:03:56.620 
out of proportion and for dogs class

00:03:56.620 --> 00:03:58.379 
out of proportion and for dogs class
figure<00:03:56.949> this<00:03:57.099> guy<00:03:57.189> is<00:03:57.310> really<00:03:57.759> small<00:03:58.090> I<00:03:58.239> mean

00:03:58.379 --> 00:03:58.389 
figure this guy is really small I mean

00:03:58.389 --> 00:04:00.059 
figure this guy is really small I mean
he's<00:03:58.509> smaller<00:03:58.810> than<00:03:58.959> Laserbeak<00:03:59.620> is<00:03:59.799> long

00:04:00.059 --> 00:04:00.069 
he's smaller than Laserbeak is long

00:04:00.069 --> 00:04:02.999 
he's smaller than Laserbeak is long
simply<00:04:01.000> because<00:04:01.299> his<00:04:01.509> legs<00:04:01.810> are<00:04:02.079> stuck<00:04:02.769> like

00:04:02.999 --> 00:04:03.009 
simply because his legs are stuck like

00:04:03.009 --> 00:04:05.159 
simply because his legs are stuck like
this<00:04:03.069> they<00:04:04.000> are<00:04:04.030> stuck<00:04:04.540> in<00:04:04.780> this<00:04:04.900> bend

00:04:05.159 --> 00:04:05.169 
this they are stuck in this bend

00:04:05.169 --> 00:04:06.960 
this they are stuck in this bend
position<00:04:05.349> partially<00:04:06.189> because<00:04:06.519> of<00:04:06.699> the<00:04:06.790> rear

00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:06.970 
position partially because of the rear

00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:09.059 
position partially because of the rear
windshield<00:04:07.329> which<00:04:07.689> is<00:04:07.840> this<00:04:08.560> piece<00:04:08.829> right

00:04:09.059 --> 00:04:09.069 
windshield which is this piece right

00:04:09.069 --> 00:04:11.640

can't<00:04:12.040> end<00:04:12.310> any<00:04:13.299> farther<00:04:13.720> than<00:04:13.930> that<00:04:14.049> so<00:04:14.349> you

00:04:14.429 --> 00:04:14.439 
can't end any farther than that so you

00:04:14.439 --> 00:04:17.399 
can't end any farther than that so you

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:33.370 
light driving I thought there was but

00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:36.660 
light driving I thought there was but
there<00:04:33.520> is<00:04:33.610> not<00:04:34.830> now<00:04:35.830> what<00:04:36.190> I<00:04:36.220> was<00:04:36.370> talking

00:04:36.670 --> 00:04:39.120 
there is not now what I was talking
about<00:04:36.730> with<00:04:36.970> the<00:04:37.060> hips<00:04:37.330> is<00:04:37.770> it's<00:04:38.770> a<00:04:38.920> little

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:39.130 
about with the hips is it's a little

00:04:39.130 --> 00:04:41.330 
about with the hips is it's a little
weird<00:04:39.340> you've<00:04:39.520> got<00:04:39.700> this<00:04:39.910> minimal

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:41.340 
weird you've got this minimal

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:43.920 
weird you've got this minimal
possibility<00:04:42.340> in<00:04:42.430> the<00:04:42.550> hips<00:04:42.790> and<00:04:43.120> then<00:04:43.750> these

00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:43.930 
possibility in the hips and then these

00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:46.380 
possibility in the hips and then these
swing<00:04:44.470> swivel<00:04:45.190> or<00:04:45.370> swing<00:04:45.700> joints<00:04:46.060> here

00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:46.390 
swing swivel or swing joints here

00:04:46.390 --> 00:04:48.210 
swing swivel or swing joints here
connected<00:04:46.960> to<00:04:46.990> ball<00:04:47.260> joints<00:04:47.680> connected<00:04:48.130> to

00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:48.220 
connected to ball joints connected to

00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:51.930 
connected to ball joints connected to
swivel<00:04:48.490> joints<00:04:49.030> and<00:04:49.200> then<00:04:50.200> his<00:04:50.500> legs<00:04:50.800> are<00:04:51.070> kind

00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:51.940 
swivel joints and then his legs are kind

00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:55.940 
swivel joints and then his legs are kind
of<00:04:52.120> stuck<00:04:52.600> like<00:04:52.810> that<00:04:53.020> but<00:04:53.200> his<00:04:53.290> arms<00:04:53.680> are<00:04:54.520> on<00:04:55.060> a

00:04:55.940 --> 00:04:55.950 
of stuck like that but his arms are on a

00:04:55.950 --> 00:04:59.400 
of stuck like that but his arms are on a
swirl<00:04:56.950> joint<00:04:57.250> there<00:04:57.520> ball<00:04:58.210> joint<00:04:58.540> and<00:04:58.870> then

00:04:59.400 --> 00:04:59.410 
swirl joint there ball joint and then

00:04:59.410 --> 00:05:01.950 
swirl joint there ball joint and then
there's<00:04:59.560> a<00:04:59.620> hinge<00:04:59.950> joint<00:05:00.040> there<00:05:00.960> connecting

00:05:01.950 --> 00:05:01.960 
there's a hinge joint there connecting

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:04.620 
there's a hinge joint there connecting
to<00:05:02.680> a<00:05:02.710> ball<00:05:02.980> joint<00:05:03.190> that<00:05:03.520> really<00:05:04.120> can't<00:05:04.390> move

00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:04.630 
to a ball joint that really can't move

00:05:04.630 --> 00:05:06.600 
to a ball joint that really can't move
anything<00:05:05.170> other<00:05:05.320> than<00:05:05.500> in-and-out<00:05:05.800> and<00:05:06.100> then

00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:06.610 
anything other than in-and-out and then

00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:08.340 
anything other than in-and-out and then
his<00:05:06.730> wrists<00:05:07.060> move<00:05:07.270> and<00:05:07.510> his<00:05:07.600> hands<00:05:07.870> can<00:05:08.140> close

00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:08.350 
his wrists move and his hands can close

00:05:08.350 --> 00:05:11.520 
his wrists move and his hands can close
so<00:05:09.270> honestly<00:05:10.270> I<00:05:10.420> think<00:05:10.540> there<00:05:11.020> had<00:05:11.170> been<00:05:11.320> other

00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:11.530 
so honestly I think there had been other

00:05:11.530 --> 00:05:14.610 
so honestly I think there had been other
better<00:05:12.130> barricades<00:05:13.000> but<00:05:13.180> this<00:05:13.480> one's<00:05:13.720> I<00:05:13.960> think

00:05:14.610 --> 00:05:14.620 
better barricades but this one's I think

00:05:14.620 --> 00:05:17.040 
better barricades but this one's I think
more<00:05:14.800> opposable<00:05:15.400> than<00:05:15.670> the<00:05:15.760> others<00:05:16.050> except

00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:17.050 
more opposable than the others except

00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:18.510 
more opposable than the others except
for<00:05:17.170> the<00:05:17.230> Human<00:05:17.500> Alliance<00:05:17.590> barricade<00:05:18.340> which

00:05:18.510 --> 00:05:18.520 
for the Human Alliance barricade which

00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:21.270 
for the Human Alliance barricade which
was<00:05:18.700> by<00:05:18.820> far<00:05:19.060> my<00:05:19.390> favorite<00:05:19.960> this<00:05:20.530> one<00:05:20.590> isn't

00:05:21.270 --> 00:05:21.280 
was by far my favorite this one isn't

00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:21.990 
was by far my favorite this one isn't
bad

00:05:21.990 --> 00:05:22.000 
bad

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:24.300 
bad
I<00:05:22.080> wouldn't<00:05:23.080> put<00:05:23.260> him<00:05:23.380> at<00:05:23.440> the<00:05:23.530> top<00:05:23.770> of<00:05:23.950> your<00:05:23.980> to

I wouldn't put him at the top of your to

00:05:24.310 --> 00:05:26.310 
I wouldn't put him at the top of your to
purchase<00:05:24.850> this<00:05:25.030> but<00:05:25.300> he's<00:05:25.480> not<00:05:25.630> bad<00:05:25.960> at<00:05:26.140> all

00:05:26.310 --> 00:05:26.320 
purchase this but he's not bad at all

00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:28.920 
purchase this but he's not bad at all
he's<00:05:26.650> definitely<00:05:27.250> worth<00:05:27.430> looking<00:05:28.000> at<00:05:28.120> I<00:05:28.390> love

00:05:28.920 --> 00:05:28.930 
he's definitely worth looking at I love

00:05:28.930 --> 00:05:30.120 
he's definitely worth looking at I love
the<00:05:29.050> fact<00:05:29.260> that<00:05:29.350> you<00:05:29.470> could<00:05:29.620> store<00:05:29.920> his

00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:30.130 
the fact that you could store his

00:05:30.130 --> 00:05:32.190 
the fact that you could store his
mech-tech<00:05:30.340> weapon<00:05:30.910> in<00:05:31.120> robot<00:05:31.570> mode<00:05:31.600> just<00:05:32.080> on

00:05:32.190 --> 00:05:32.200 
mech-tech weapon in robot mode just on

00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:33.750 
mech-tech weapon in robot mode just on
his<00:05:32.320> pack<00:05:32.560> it<00:05:32.740> does<00:05:32.980> make<00:05:33.370> him<00:05:33.490> a<00:05:33.550> little

00:05:33.750 --> 00:05:33.760 
his pack it does make him a little

00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:36.870 
his pack it does make him a little
top-heavy<00:05:33.970> but<00:05:35.040> one<00:05:36.040> thing<00:05:36.190> I<00:05:36.280> noticed<00:05:36.640> is

00:05:36.870 --> 00:05:36.880 
top-heavy but one thing I noticed is

00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:39.450 
top-heavy but one thing I noticed is
that<00:05:36.940> the<00:05:37.270> legs<00:05:37.540> collapse<00:05:38.080> right<00:05:38.980> back<00:05:39.190> onto

00:05:39.450 --> 00:05:39.460 
that the legs collapse right back onto

00:05:39.460 --> 00:05:41.850 
that the legs collapse right back onto
the<00:05:39.670> back<00:05:39.820> hood<00:05:40.510> of<00:05:40.810> the<00:05:40.960> vehicle<00:05:40.990> mode<00:05:41.500> so

00:05:41.850 --> 00:05:41.860 
the back hood of the vehicle mode so

00:05:41.860 --> 00:05:46.110 
the back hood of the vehicle mode so
he's<00:05:42.550> pretty<00:05:42.910> stable<00:05:43.510> which<00:05:44.230> is<00:05:44.380> good<00:05:44.640> if<00:05:45.640> he

00:05:46.110 --> 00:05:46.120 
he's pretty stable which is good if he

00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:47.940 
he's pretty stable which is good if he
even<00:05:46.690> though<00:05:46.780> he<00:05:46.870> lacked<00:05:47.140> severely<00:05:47.650> relaxed

00:05:47.940 --> 00:05:47.950 
even though he lacked severely relaxed

00:05:47.950 --> 00:05:50.700 
even though he lacked severely relaxed
pose<00:05:48.190> ability<00:05:48.640> would<00:05:49.510> I<00:05:49.570> pick<00:05:49.780> him<00:05:49.900> up<00:05:50.050> not<00:05:50.560> as

00:05:50.700 --> 00:05:50.710 
pose ability would I pick him up not as

00:05:50.710 --> 00:05:52.710 
pose ability would I pick him up not as
my<00:05:50.860> first<00:05:51.100> choice<00:05:51.220> but<00:05:51.730> he's<00:05:52.030> definitely<00:05:52.600> not

00:05:52.710 --> 00:05:52.720 
my first choice but he's definitely not

00:05:52.720 --> 00:05:54.060 
my first choice but he's definitely not
a<00:05:52.780> bad<00:05:52.990> figure<00:05:53.260> and<00:05:53.500> he's<00:05:53.590> definitely

00:05:54.060 --> 00:05:54.070 
a bad figure and he's definitely
