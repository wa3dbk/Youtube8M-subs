00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:03.159
 [music] 

00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:14.790
 [music] 

00:00:11.929 --> 00:00:18.750
 Hello everyone guys, the last parcel is 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:20.970
 today here soon parcel is not 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:23.039
 know on monday there will be something or 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:25.080
 No, then we will have a new year 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:28.939
 videos do not know honestly want to relax 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:31.890
 just not even fit the computer 

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:34.680
 as you identified by the name of us in 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:37.350
 video will be goupro from China but I am such 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:37.920
 call gopro because it's an action 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:41.430
 camera 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:44.340
 for 41 dollars let's watch it reached 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:47.640
 she to us I do not even remember the back 30 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:49.950
 sort of told you what you ordered 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:51.270
 very long been interested to see 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:53.699
 on this unit 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:56.550
 of course and test it to the full 

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:59.239
 the program we will dive somewhere 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:02.760
 basin of water a day and that's 

00:00:59.239 --> 00:01:09.119
 let's see how it shoots how it sounds 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:13.430
 writes so because these cameras I you 

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:16.170
 I will say this, but they take it very well 

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:18.119
 just selling there going wild therefore 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:20.340
 I understand the camera for example 

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:23.549
 a man who rides a bicycle 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:25.979
 yes he takes such a camera 

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:27.780
 currently it comes to a bike takes off like 

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:29.970
 he rides though the quality do not know 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:34.560
 let's see immediately we see that there is no brand 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:36.600
 the box is very bad here with us 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:39.000
 there must be such a kit that a goal about 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:41.220
 resting just just at the maximum 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.229
 picking it was trying with such 

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:48.530
 bundling charging 

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:48.530
 Immediately with our intelligence this pleases 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:56.580
 so even a sucker there is a 30 car 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:02:00.149
 you can also pick up in principle Th 

00:01:56.580 --> 00:02:02.280
 and pick up in the test can go like 

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:04.860
 DVR want recharging there 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:05.690
 no automotive in principle here 

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:11.690
 mount 

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:18.140
 not really so yes too not turning 

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:23.790
 here is the most common mount it is so 

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:30.090
 farther we have the camera itself like this 

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:34.160
 looks like in boxing here by stapling so 

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:36.360
 boxing opens 1 2 

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:39.680
 trees, sticks guys have been there for a long time 

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:42.780
 Goupro for myself bought for $ 40 

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:45.630
 Case I'll tell you this well, serious 

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:51.110
 will I miss it or not I will of course 

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:54.540
 first check sport camera see yes 

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:58.350
 so here we basically where 

00:02:54.540 --> 00:03:03.140
 built-in battery then we have 

00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:06.570
 here the card is inserted that principle 

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:08.459
 everything turns on and off and probably 

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:11.120
 sensory besides think so now we are to 

00:03:08.459 --> 00:03:14.579
 she will come to her 

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:15.480
 because we have a kit like this 

00:03:14.579 --> 00:03:17.700
 kit 

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:24.060
 I honestly do not know why these are all 

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:27.090
 kits so now let's see something 

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:32.760
 here is spinning around and by the way guys here 

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:34.890
 he probably and or not here you and the steering wheel 

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:39.329
 By the way the set if you probably ride 

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:43.500
 it is very big then she is probably driving 

00:03:39.329 --> 00:03:45.480
 attached here hanged here still here 

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:49.139
 so shorter mounts just mass 

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:50.819
 listen so it doesn't turn around 

00:03:49.139 --> 00:03:53.650
 or turns do not know need 

00:03:50.819 --> 00:03:56.709
 to understand but there is a mount 

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:59.010
 it pleases because you mount 

00:03:56.709 --> 00:04:01.840
 know what to buy separately 

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:03.939
 if for example on gopro they buy 

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:05.829
 very expensive but were there at all 

00:04:03.939 --> 00:04:09.250
 crazy money for non pros 

00:04:05.829 --> 00:04:11.349
 To get here car charger and 

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:13.569
 micro yusbi principle is therefore possible 

00:04:11.349 --> 00:04:13.989
 with love registrar but complete it 

00:04:13.569 --> 00:04:15.849
 there is 

00:04:13.989 --> 00:04:18.340
 so you can use as 

00:04:15.849 --> 00:04:22.600
 DVR further with us here 

00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:26.470
 here's the thing there is this here we have it 

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:29.380
 probably the public is glued 

00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:32.889
 Scotch bundle no and so full 

00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:34.720
 double-sided tape glued ali 

00:04:32.889 --> 00:04:38.110
 wait no-no-no-no-no 

00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:43.990
 this is nobody we have a strap which 

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:48.340
 one can imagine that the pick up on the head 

00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:50.320
 Now this strap so he goes to the strap 

00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:53.500
 this strap clings to this 

00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:57.009
 mount and you can head on 

00:04:53.500 --> 00:05:00.400
 hang on go shoot at school all 

00:04:57.009 --> 00:05:04.240
 or university is so cool with us 

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:09.280
 another mount shorter mount 

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:11.610
 just head really here and so more 

00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:16.389
 some mount here you see put 

00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:21.010
 click just screwed and all such 

00:05:16.389 --> 00:05:25.960
 protective case and micro usb cable all 

00:05:21.010 --> 00:05:31.960
 principle, there is nothing so how would it 

00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:37.810
 now take off to the children and business even 

00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:40.919
 clicked and I already turned on 

00:05:37.810 --> 00:05:44.580
 included see picture 

00:05:40.919 --> 00:05:48.720
 overlap switches sazhdi to 640 

00:05:44.580 --> 00:05:52.000
 battery charge permission shows 

00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:59.460
 we can touch the screen like this 

00:05:52.000 --> 00:06:03.669
 bring so close but the cool thing 

00:05:59.460 --> 00:06:06.639
 Of course you need to test it to 

00:06:03.669 --> 00:06:09.300
 see the picture because bye bye 

00:06:06.639 --> 00:06:09.300
 it's not about anything 

00:06:10.289 --> 00:06:20.110
