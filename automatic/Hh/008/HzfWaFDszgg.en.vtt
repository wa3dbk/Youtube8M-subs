 have attached 

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:32.820
 specifically a bottle book because 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:34.950
 when we pour the nitrogen we will flip going 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:37.170
 upside down right because u 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:39.090
 five-liter bottle is a very weak cork 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:40.710

 Looks like nothing got this we her 

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:46.230
 we stick together so that there is a very 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:47.309
 it's important for us to understand that some are weak 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:50.160
 weak on the front 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:52.760
