00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:57.180
 that a Youtube people bring you another 

00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:58.680
 new video and good as you can see I've 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:01.140
 bought another figure from toy story 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:03.810
 this time he shows them face of dad 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:06.170
 the new version of play in see by the 

00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:06.170
 back side 

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:11.360
 As you can see, I have a new one 

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:13.960
 image and some legs is already a little more 

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:16.670
 slim a little smaller this trail 

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:20.690
 different parts as we remember 

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:22.250
 in 1999 and well then let's review what 

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:24.610
 what is the packaging as you can see here 

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:26.380
 it only tells us the name 

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:28.030
 on the one hand only behind the brand of 

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:30.160
 play school from the back 

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:31.960
 we found some specifications that 

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:34.420
 bring new holes bring new 

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:36.670
 pieces and this tells us that it already brings 

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:38.470
 who told them that they are already legs and 

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:40.660
 also on the other hand it shows us all 

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:43.030
 the pieces that we can find inside 

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:45.400
 of what is the packaging and for the part 

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:48.729
 from the front, nothing more than the name 

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:51.330
 no good let's do the unboxing and he 

00:01:48.729 --> 00:01:51.330
 is back 

00:01:55.870 --> 00:02:02.830
 as you can see it is only the casing 

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:05.740
 of cardboard a small cardboard for the part 

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:10.110
 from behind with a landscape 

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:10.110
 a small plastic from a distance came out 

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:15.230
 and well , here we have it 

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:21.099
 this as I comment you is the new 

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:24.400
 version of place 

00:02:21.099 --> 00:02:27.250
 there are three different faces of dad and the 

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:31.350
 lady who now has an expensive son 

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:33.690
 of dad and what is the lord every stage 

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:36.210
 three different pieces we are going to separate 

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:39.710
 one by one so they can see everything 

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:39.710
 bring what is the Lord each stage 

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:47.460
 it's a very different version of the 

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:49.920
 earlier as you can see these are the 

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:52.230
 legs already brings legs previously 

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:55.560
 it was only the shoes he brings in 

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:58.020
 this base this oval so I could 

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:59.970
 sit or stand this flake of 

00:02:58.020 --> 00:03:02.040
 mediatrade more holes on this side 

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:03.870
 on this side and in the back 

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:06.240
 had these holes now and the 

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:12.230
 brings as always brings the back 

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:12.230
 this what are your glasses 

00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:21.390
 maybe glasses and it also brings us what 

00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:23.970
 it is a language to make different 

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:25.440
 gestures with what is this to look at has already 

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:28.140
 also changed the design of the part 

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:31.400
 from behind before this part could not be 

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:33.750
 remove now you can remove this 

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:36.390
 as you can see there is everything 

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:40.040
 it's a dad's face and we 're going to 

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:40.040
 arm in fast camera 

00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:12.340
 equally as you can see we have already 

00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:15.430
 we are going to make a comparison 

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:17.470
 with what is the tweet in laughter and what 

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:20.050
 it's street the toy story 3 so you can see 

00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:22.380
 the average size of these figures and 

00:04:20.050 --> 00:04:22.380
 right now 

00:04:22.389 --> 00:04:26.729
 and good in as you can see the size 

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:28.510
 it's almost the same as what this twitch is 

00:04:26.729 --> 00:04:31.300
 this 

00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:33.550
 a little bigger change is already very 

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:34.120
 different to what is the figure of this 

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:35.350
 version 

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:37.720
 this new version to what was the 

00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:40.360
 previous is very different it is no longer 

00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:42.280
 but you can not recover what 

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:44.200
 what you had before and good people I hope 

00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:46.690
