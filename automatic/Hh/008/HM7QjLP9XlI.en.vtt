00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:05.700
 how long I intend to stay in there 

00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:09.360
 habo savino tesoro 

00:00:10.009 --> 00:00:13.459
 the oil works alone 

00:00:13.459 --> 00:00:16.459
 I only have 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:18.949
 kawar 10 

00:00:18.949 --> 00:00:21.949
 we cannot stay here forever 

00:00:28.359 --> 00:00:31.279
 informed on the highway 

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:34.520
 song engineer chief of the riviera weather the right tenderness 

00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:38.660
 how do you know me 

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:41.320
 he talked about you for mine 

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:44.020
 go on to save me 

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:47.020
 here I'm sorry but first there is another thing I have to do 

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:48.970
 note well 

00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:51.970
 come on, just don't be one of them 

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:55.580
 you have been hurt 

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:57.010
 I'm in place 

00:00:57.010 --> 00:01:00.590
 I just took a twisted ankle while trying to escape 

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:03.590
 lost everything here there is nothing to worry about 

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:07.040
 no questions to ask you 

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:10.040
 I need information on metal piero 

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:13.230
 - Street 

00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:16.570
 what is the real purpose of metal d 

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:18.270
 is a system of mobile myths 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:21.640
 it was designed for nuclear missiles only for purpose 

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:24.220
 defensive of course 

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:25.890
 I know very well that the messenger 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:28.950
 it is nothing more than a death machine equipped with nuclear missiles 

00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:31.620
 nuclear missiles 

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:33.230
 what are you talking about 

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:36.700
 the terrorist groups are going to use the weather around to launch one 

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:37.640
 atomic bomb 

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:39.970
 you can make me believe you didn't know 

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:43.620
 I want to assemble a warhead dismantled in the missile manner of the people 

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:44.890
 procurement 

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:46.110
 mistaken 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:49.540
 therefore at the beginning the purpose of this exercise to test the 

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:51.790
 Wednesday's nuclear launch capability 

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:53.460
 using a fake state 

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:57.130
 who terrorists are just continuans of construction work is not true 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:01.140
 I heard it directly from your boss in Greece 

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:05.270
 a nuclear missile on 3x 

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:08.270
 then you didn't really know 

00:02:09.019 --> 00:02:13.010
 the superpad armament a separate department is the president inter any 

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:16.509
 take care of the final assembly on the main unit 

00:02:16.509 --> 00:02:19.229
 president 

00:02:19.229 --> 00:02:20.829
 just him 

00:02:20.829 --> 00:02:24.439
 they never told me exactly what weapons you have now only that 

00:02:24.439 --> 00:02:26.400
 he mounted a vulcan machine gun 

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:29.400
 laser and a rail cannon 

00:02:35.509 --> 00:02:37.979
 You said I wasn't cut 

00:02:37.979 --> 00:02:41.360
 the use of magnets to shoot bullets at very delicate speed 

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:44.740
 the technology was originally designed for the clothes project 

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:46.279
 before being discharged 

00:02:46.279 --> 00:02:47.629
 we have succeeded 

00:02:47.629 --> 00:02:50.529
 miniaturize the weapon 

00:02:50.529 --> 00:02:53.529
 dorian's you that coming from the xbox world 

00:02:55.209 --> 00:02:59.360
 the main function of the sea the launch of nuclear missiles you are sure of 

00:02:59.359 --> 00:03:00.939
 don't forget anything 

00:03:00.939 --> 00:03:04.099
 hotel metal Ã  a form on the back where they can be voted 

00:03:04.099 --> 00:03:07.129
 climate you're telling me that from the beginning it was thought missiles 

00:03:07.129 --> 00:03:10.129
 nuclear 

00:03:14.279 --> 00:03:18.419
 yes, but that's not all if the weather and black could read it nuclear missiles 

00:03:18.419 --> 00:03:21.959
 standards would not have needed to conduct this test to get cats 

00:03:29.649 --> 00:03:31.680
 return in Milan 

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:35.440
 that joined us in the development of heart metal wolves were 

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:38.720
 designing a new type of nuclear weapon using devices 

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:42.640
 experimental for laser fusion hey supercomputer of the nds 

00:03:43.679 --> 00:03:47.139
 in short, they have created a new nuclear weapon in an experiment center 

00:03:47.139 --> 00:03:49.449
 vr simulation right 

00:03:49.449 --> 00:03:53.469
 but you cannot use the simulation data you need the data relative to a 

00:03:53.469 --> 00:03:56.269
 true launch 

00:03:56.269 --> 00:04:00.810
 these are a part of the supercomputer reconnect cooking anything in 

00:04:00.809 --> 00:04:03.849
 virtual environments all in the field of glory 

00:04:03.849 --> 00:04:06.849
 then this situation helped put things big 

00:04:09.319 --> 00:04:13.319
 what our president did is the one you were star on your neck 

00:04:13.319 --> 00:04:16.319
 clause 

00:04:18.509 --> 00:04:21.509
 hahaha no no no no 

00:04:30.559 --> 00:04:32.360
 plate cut out 

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:35.379
 that my grandfather was part of the manhattan project 

00:04:36.129 --> 00:04:39.539
 as an offering for his sin 

00:04:39.539 --> 00:04:42.539
 for the rest of his life 

00:04:43.189 --> 00:04:46.069
 my father 

00:04:46.069 --> 00:04:49.129
 penned on 6 August 1945 

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:53.759
 per day of the bomb on hiroshima 

00:04:53.759 --> 00:04:56.759
 after all god is the sense of humor 

00:04:59.349 --> 00:05:03.000
 three generations tn risce we have to bring x 

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:06.570
 recipe in our DNA the curse of nuclear weapons 

00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:15.780
 You know I was under the illusion of being able to use science to help humanity 

00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:19.760
 but in the end the only one who made the figure of the stupid is me 

00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:23.600
 sorry the absence to help humanity only works in movies 

00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:27.520
 there is 

00:05:28.349 --> 00:05:31.349
 I should put the rules are things the so-called 

00:05:40.719 --> 00:05:43.219
 irs in the scooter maintenance phase 

00:05:43.219 --> 00:05:44.319
 and where it would be 

00:05:44.319 --> 00:05:47.279
 they have communication operators but far from here 

00:05:47.279 --> 00:05:51.800
 the detonation code turning system is also in the room 

00:05:51.799 --> 00:05:52.930
 damask controls 

00:05:52.930 --> 00:05:54.650
 make it better to hurry up 

00:05:54.650 --> 00:05:57.370
 if they are planning the launch from the beginning then the program 

00:05:57.370 --> 00:05:59.740
 ballistic probably already been terminated 

00:05:59.740 --> 00:06:02.960
 some hours that do not contact me I believe that they have no longer available and I think 

00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:04.509
 that we are ready to launch 

00:06:04.509 --> 00:06:08.249
 buell to the card to lock the decoration codes we will contact 

00:06:08.249 --> 00:06:09.409
 with air 

00:06:09.409 --> 00:06:12.409
 we will be able to stop the launch we will have to destroy remixes 

00:06:19.469 --> 00:06:21.479
 the monster the way 

00:06:21.479 --> 00:06:22.740
 it's your leg 

00:06:22.740 --> 00:06:25.449
 you will do nothing but slow down 

00:06:25.449 --> 00:06:28.550
 you will need me if you need to destroy the ex 

00:06:28.550 --> 00:06:29.460
 unspoken 

00:06:29.460 --> 00:06:32.539
 only for cakes 

00:06:32.539 --> 00:06:36.060
 best creator ex my right October 1 destroy it 

00:06:40.210 --> 00:06:41.990
 find a way to escape 

00:06:41.990 --> 00:06:45.819
 once the thing is free to contact a mechanical operator 

00:06:45.819 --> 00:06:48.819
 I wander around an island 

00:06:49.649 --> 00:06:52.309
 sweet 

00:06:52.309 --> 00:06:54.550
 hide and keep in touch with me 

00:06:54.550 --> 00:06:57.550
 you know this place is not true of course 

00:06:58.129 --> 00:06:59.830
 Venetian courts 

00:06:59.830 --> 00:07:02.919
 but this year 

00:07:02.919 --> 00:07:05.889
 it is the same camouflage technology 

00:07:05.889 --> 00:07:08.389
 the fox town intended never to use it 

00:07:08.389 --> 00:07:10.020
 with this I will be sure 

00:07:10.020 --> 00:07:12.599
 sprained ankle and all the rest 

00:07:12.599 --> 00:07:14.240
 I prefer that you deserve liver
