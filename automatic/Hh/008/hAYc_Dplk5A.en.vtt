 I mean, if you go to school, you're wearing your shoes. 

00:00:56.350 --> 00:01:06.880
 I went to school and went to school. 

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:12.190
 The sheep, but the way of education can actually be left in our reality. 

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:16.780
 Tell the kids all the time, as no one can love animals and nature and then 

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:21.940
 Such a system that is going a bit thin and contains liked me right then that I 

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:25.000
 I hope for getting both sides to the elements and do not know why I can do this, Ile-shaped 

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:29.410

 I know the culprit even write that I die so I yigyean 

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:47.290
 I think the kids who want to study here need to have studied in advance . 

00:01:43.869 --> 00:01:51.460
 I will also tell you from another perspective, according to the generation. 

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:57.640
 You're talking about the most just think this part when the chamber despite abroad 

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:58.540
 I'm too busy at the end of the second half of the year. 

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:04.300
 I'm here 

00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:08.380
 It was a little bit harder to write in front of you, just open it or in a foreign language . 

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:14.110
 It's important to watch American dramas and movies that will really release kids in high school. 

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:16.630
 The student is a salman field, but that's not it . Our campus is probably 

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:19.959
 Uh, college graduation, late college party. 

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:23.950
 Then foreign drama college I'm often 

00:02:19.959 --> 00:02:28.150
 Success in foreign countries or self-care 

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:33.190
 In high school it must take place here, even upside of content 

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:36.760
 I need to report it incredibly tight . 4 Good. 

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:39.519
 We need to ask, but you can cut it. 

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:42.820
 Oh, it's more of a high school student . 

00:02:39.519 --> 00:02:46.060
 It's thin and you have to pick one of them. 

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:49.910
 I think you have a cheer in the overseas side. 

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:55.880
 I'll have a lot of secretary enrollment once. 

00:02:49.910 --> 00:03:02.450
 If you look at the four cases, 

00:02:55.880 --> 00:03:07.610
 Yes , there are four of those who treat me better. 

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:11.030
 There are children who are well-suited to do well in Korea, 

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:15.680
 Better yet, better still 5 

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:20.030
 4 It is important to note that the environment in which the house is located in the country itself 

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:25.040
 We have to attack from the very poor and deunyo morning till night is a gala that environment 

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:29.360
 The second problem is the school atmosphere. School violence and bullying these days. 

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:34.010
 Things as a social problem parents our child victim or perhaps 

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:38.540
 Maybe if worry is the perpetrator scared of any learning environment system to study abroad 

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:42.950
 There are a lot of people who think about it . 

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:43.940
 I think it is necessary to improve the environment because it is an education environment for three reasons. 

00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:45.970
 Oh yes. 

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:45.970
