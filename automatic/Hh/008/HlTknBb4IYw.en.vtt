00:01:48.039 --> 00:01:48.049 
which is vital and works against air

00:01:48.049 --> 00:01:49.880 
which is vital and works against air
enemies<00:01:49.049> and<00:01:49.320> then<00:01:49.409> you<00:01:49.530> have<00:01:49.710> your

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
enemies and then you have your

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:52.069 
enemies and then you have your
machine-gun<00:01:50.700> turrets<00:01:51.119> which<00:01:51.329> you<00:01:51.600> can<00:01:51.780> build

00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:52.079 
machine-gun turrets which you can build

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:54.740 
machine-gun turrets which you can build
over<00:01:52.439> here<00:01:52.920> and<00:01:53.100> I<00:01:53.729> have<00:01:53.909> 20<00:01:54.270> left<00:01:54.299> so<00:01:54.689> I'm

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750 
over here and I have 20 left so I'm

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:57.950 
over here and I have 20 left so I'm
going<00:01:54.780> to<00:01:54.899> put<00:01:55.110> another<00:01:55.560> one<00:01:56.299> over<00:01:57.299> here<00:01:57.329> tap

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:57.960 
going to put another one over here tap

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:00.560 
going to put another one over here tap
on<00:01:58.170> it<00:01:58.290> and<00:01:58.409> drag<00:01:58.649> it<00:01:58.799> over<00:01:58.890> here<00:01:59.210> maybe<00:02:00.210> I<00:02:00.329> can

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:00.570 
on it and drag it over here maybe I can

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:03.530 
on it and drag it over here maybe I can
put<00:02:00.750> it<00:02:00.869> there<00:02:01.140> and<00:02:01.950> squeeze<00:02:02.369> it<00:02:02.700> so<00:02:03.210> you<00:02:03.270> have

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:03.540 
put it there and squeeze it so you have

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:05.240 
put it there and squeeze it so you have
to<00:02:03.570> be<00:02:03.960> you<00:02:04.200> know<00:02:04.320> you<00:02:04.560> got<00:02:04.680> to<00:02:04.799> kind<00:02:04.920> of<00:02:05.040> work

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:05.250 
to be you know you got to kind of work

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:07.160 
to be you know you got to kind of work
to<00:02:05.490> where<00:02:05.640> you<00:02:05.790> can<00:02:05.939> put<00:02:06.149> them<00:02:06.329> once<00:02:06.990> you're

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:07.170 
to where you can put them once you're

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:08.930 
to where you can put them once you're
done<00:02:07.469> there's<00:02:07.829> a<00:02:07.890> little<00:02:08.250> button<00:02:08.580> here<00:02:08.849> that's

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:08.940 
done there's a little button here that's

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:12.190 
done there's a little button here that's
blinking<00:02:09.569> tap<00:02:10.170> on<00:02:10.410> that<00:02:10.679> the<00:02:11.340> past

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:12.200 
blinking tap on that the past

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:14.500 
blinking tap on that the past
the<00:02:12.319> enemy's<00:02:12.709> is<00:02:12.890> going<00:02:13.069> to<00:02:13.130> go<00:02:13.220> away<00:02:13.520> and<00:02:14.240> now

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:14.510 
the enemy's is going to go away and now

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:17.410 
the enemy's is going to go away and now
the<00:02:15.230> action<00:02:15.680> starts<00:02:16.220> and<00:02:16.459> hopefully<00:02:16.940> the

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:17.420 
the action starts and hopefully the

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:19.030 
the action starts and hopefully the
defenses<00:02:17.930> you<00:02:17.959> set<00:02:18.319> up<00:02:18.470> are<00:02:18.620> going<00:02:18.709> to<00:02:18.800> work

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:19.040 
defenses you set up are going to work

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:21.370 
defenses you set up are going to work
now<00:02:19.550> in<00:02:19.670> the<00:02:19.760> bottom<00:02:20.120> right<00:02:20.390> there's<00:02:21.020> a<00:02:21.080> pause

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:21.380 
now in the bottom right there's a pause

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:23.559 
now in the bottom right there's a pause
button<00:02:21.800> where<00:02:22.340> I<00:02:22.370> could<00:02:22.610> pause<00:02:22.849> the<00:02:23.150> action

00:02:23.559 --> 00:02:23.569 
button where I could pause the action

00:02:23.569 --> 00:02:25.780 
button where I could pause the action
and<00:02:23.690> I<00:02:23.750> can<00:02:23.900> also<00:02:24.020> speed<00:02:24.650> it<00:02:24.800> up<00:02:24.950> and<00:02:25.430> when<00:02:25.640> it's

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:25.790 
and I can also speed it up and when it's

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:28.030 
and I can also speed it up and when it's
lit<00:02:26.000> up<00:02:26.180> or<00:02:26.420> when<00:02:26.630> it's<00:02:26.780> beige<00:02:27.050> that<00:02:27.800> means

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:28.040 
lit up or when it's beige that means

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:31.600 
lit up or when it's beige that means
it's<00:02:28.160> going<00:02:28.310> to<00:02:28.400> be<00:02:28.520> faster<00:02:30.489> obviously<00:02:31.489> you

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:31.610 
it's going to be faster obviously you

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:33.699 
it's going to be faster obviously you
get<00:02:31.730> points<00:02:32.180> for<00:02:32.209> killing<00:02:33.020> the<00:02:33.260> enemies

00:02:33.699 --> 00:02:33.709 
get points for killing the enemies

00:02:33.709 --> 00:02:36.699 
get points for killing the enemies
and/or<00:02:34.370> cash<00:02:34.700> rather<00:02:35.120> and<00:02:35.690> it<00:02:35.840> racks<00:02:36.230> up<00:02:36.530> in

00:02:36.699 --> 00:02:36.709 
and/or cash rather and it racks up in

00:02:36.709 --> 00:02:38.170 
and/or cash rather and it racks up in
the<00:02:36.770> upper<00:02:37.130> left<00:02:37.160> there<00:02:37.550> you<00:02:37.610> can<00:02:37.880> see<00:02:38.030> your

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:38.180 
the upper left there you can see your

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:40.270 
the upper left there you can see your
health<00:02:38.420> next<00:02:38.870> to<00:02:38.989> that<00:02:39.170> and<00:02:39.470> then<00:02:39.920> the<00:02:40.040> waves

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:40.280 
health next to that and then the waves

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:42.309 
health next to that and then the waves
are<00:02:40.550> in<00:02:40.700> the<00:02:40.790> top<00:02:41.060> center<00:02:41.720> and<00:02:41.900> this<00:02:41.959> is<00:02:42.019> only

00:02:42.309 --> 00:02:42.319 
are in the top center and this is only

00:02:42.319 --> 00:02:46.540 
are in the top center and this is only
one<00:02:42.739> of<00:02:43.190> 25<00:02:44.060> now<00:02:44.989> there's<00:02:45.200> one<00:02:45.260> turret<00:02:46.220> I<00:02:46.400> did

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:46.550 
one of 25 now there's one turret I did

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:49.300 
one of 25 now there's one turret I did
not<00:02:46.700> use<00:02:47.030> yet<00:02:47.390> which<00:02:47.900> is<00:02:47.930> a<00:02:48.110> freeze<00:02:48.530> tort<00:02:48.920> or<00:02:49.160> at

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:49.310 
not use yet which is a freeze tort or at

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:51.610 
not use yet which is a freeze tort or at
least<00:02:49.459> that<00:02:49.580> I<00:02:49.640> have<00:02:49.940> at<00:02:50.090> my<00:02:50.120> disposal<00:02:50.590> now<00:02:51.590> I

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:51.620 
least that I have at my disposal now I

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:53.559 
least that I have at my disposal now I
can<00:02:51.980> use<00:02:52.010> that<00:02:52.400> and<00:02:52.610> this<00:02:52.760> is<00:02:52.940> a<00:02:52.970> very<00:02:53.299> nice

00:02:53.559 --> 00:02:53.569 
can use that and this is a very nice

00:02:53.569 --> 00:02:56.440 
can use that and this is a very nice
turret<00:02:54.380> because<00:02:54.560> it<00:02:55.040> actually<00:02:55.640> slows<00:02:56.000> down

00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:56.450 
turret because it actually slows down

00:02:56.450 --> 00:02:58.990 
turret because it actually slows down
the<00:02:56.660> enemies<00:02:57.170> while<00:02:57.739> your<00:02:57.890> other<00:02:58.130> weapons<00:02:58.700> can

00:02:58.990 --> 00:02:59.000 
the enemies while your other weapons can

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.570 
the enemies while your other weapons can
take<00:02:59.660> them<00:02:59.840> out<00:02:59.959> and<00:03:00.260> you<00:03:00.680> know<00:03:00.769> load<00:03:01.280> them<00:03:01.459> up

00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:01.580 
take them out and you know load them up

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:03.640 
take them out and you know load them up
or<00:03:01.850> shoot<00:03:02.239> them<00:03:02.330> up<00:03:02.569> more<00:03:03.019> while<00:03:03.470> they're

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:03.650 
or shoot them up more while they're

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:06.039 
or shoot them up more while they're
slowed<00:03:03.980> down<00:03:04.280> again<00:03:05.150> we<00:03:05.299> can<00:03:05.450> tap<00:03:05.660> on<00:03:05.900> the

00:03:06.039 --> 00:03:06.049 
slowed down again we can tap on the

00:03:06.049 --> 00:03:09.039 
slowed down again we can tap on the
increase<00:03:06.920> or<00:03:07.239> increase<00:03:08.239> the<00:03:08.450> rate<00:03:08.720> of<00:03:08.750> the

00:03:09.039 --> 00:03:09.049 
increase or increase the rate of the

00:03:09.049 --> 00:03:11.770 
increase or increase the rate of the
enemy<00:03:09.410> coming<00:03:09.850> sometimes<00:03:10.850> it's<00:03:11.150> bad<00:03:11.420> because

00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:11.780 
enemy coming sometimes it's bad because

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:14.410 
enemy coming sometimes it's bad because
you<00:03:12.530> can<00:03:12.709> have<00:03:12.830> vehicle<00:03:13.400> blow<00:03:13.670> by<00:03:13.970> you<00:03:14.030> and<00:03:14.330> if

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:14.420 
you can have vehicle blow by you and if

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:16.660 
you can have vehicle blow by you and if
you<00:03:14.540> don't<00:03:14.720> have<00:03:14.900> the<00:03:15.049> right<00:03:15.230> defenses<00:03:15.950> well

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:16.670 
you don't have the right defenses well

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:18.280 
you don't have the right defenses well
then<00:03:17.209> they're<00:03:17.390> gonna<00:03:17.510> go<00:03:17.750> and<00:03:17.870> take<00:03:18.049> your

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:18.290 
then they're gonna go and take your

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:20.170 
then they're gonna go and take your
health<00:03:18.530> away<00:03:18.890> and<00:03:19.220> you're<00:03:19.700> probably<00:03:19.940> not

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:20.180 
health away and you're probably not

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:22.420 
health away and you're probably not
going<00:03:20.359> to<00:03:20.420> do<00:03:20.600> so<00:03:20.900> well<00:03:21.109> now<00:03:21.709> obviously<00:03:21.950> we're

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:22.430 
going to do so well now obviously we're

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:25.210 
going to do so well now obviously we're
not<00:03:22.519> gonna<00:03:22.640> play<00:03:22.820> all<00:03:23.120> 25<00:03:23.900> waves<00:03:24.440> but<00:03:24.980> there's

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:33.130 
rocket turret here
you<00:03:30.950> can<00:03:31.070> see<00:03:31.220> I<00:03:31.250> can<00:03:31.519> sell<00:03:31.910> it<00:03:31.940> I<00:03:32.299> can<00:03:32.870> upgrade

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:33.140 
you can see I can sell it I can upgrade

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:35.470 
you can see I can sell it I can upgrade
it<00:03:33.410> for<00:03:33.530> 50<00:03:34.130> currently<00:03:34.670> but<00:03:34.850> I<00:03:34.880> don't<00:03:35.060> have<00:03:35.209> the

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:35.480 
it for 50 currently but I don't have the

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:37.449 
it for 50 currently but I don't have the
money<00:03:35.690> yet<00:03:35.959> and<00:03:36.230> you<00:03:36.829> can<00:03:37.010> see<00:03:37.190> there<00:03:37.370> are

00:03:37.449 --> 00:03:37.459 
money yet and you can see there are

00:03:37.459 --> 00:03:39.550 
money yet and you can see there are
three<00:03:37.760> different<00:03:38.000> attack<00:03:38.510> options<00:03:38.900> for<00:03:39.470> the

00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:39.560 
three different attack options for the

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:42.699 
three different attack options for the
turret<00:03:39.920> attack<00:03:40.730> mirrors<00:03:41.239> attack<00:03:41.870> strongest

00:03:42.699 --> 00:03:42.709 
turret attack mirrors attack strongest

00:03:42.709 --> 00:03:45.160 
turret attack mirrors attack strongest
attack<00:03:43.220> weakest<00:03:43.850> so<00:03:44.510> you<00:03:44.600> can<00:03:44.780> actually

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:45.170 
attack weakest so you can actually

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:48.640 
attack weakest so you can actually
customize<00:03:45.440> each<00:03:46.130> turrets<00:03:46.820> attack<00:03:47.630> defense<00:03:48.350> so

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:48.650 
customize each turrets attack defense so

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:51.310 
customize each turrets attack defense so
if<00:03:48.950> I<00:03:49.250> want<00:03:49.549> the<00:03:49.760> rocket<00:03:50.209> to<00:03:50.570> attack<00:03:51.140> the

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:51.320 
if I want the rocket to attack the

00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:52.720 
if I want the rocket to attack the
strongest<00:03:51.620> which<00:03:52.010> is<00:03:52.160> typically<00:03:52.519> the

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:52.730 
strongest which is typically the

00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:55.059 
strongest which is typically the
vehicles<00:03:53.239> I<00:03:53.450> can<00:03:53.989> tap<00:03:54.230> it<00:03:54.440> on<00:03:54.560> there<00:03:54.829> and
