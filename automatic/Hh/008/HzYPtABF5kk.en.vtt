00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:09.020
 the weekend has come without football and 

00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:10.879
 Anxiety account begins to play 

00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:13.330
 from now on what is the straight 

00:00:10.879 --> 00:00:17.480
 end or the beginning at least 

00:00:13.330 --> 00:00:19.939
 yes I think it's good we spent a week 

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:21.920
 with hard training preparing the 

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:24.529
 physical because now you do not play end of 

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:26.750
 week and now the weather a lot is not 

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:28.189
 helping but also training 

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:30.079
 thinking about the match that is very 

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:32.720
 important for us 

00:00:30.079 --> 00:00:34.730
 white as you can know that that 

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:37.190
 they rehearsed today what tactical scheme yes 

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:39.180
 they kept the 4-2-3-1 or passed a 

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:41.810
 4-4-2 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:45.350
 we are delivering 

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:46.850
 many many physicists because good the 

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:49.790
 courts does not allow us for the subject of the 

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:53.120
 weather but good with running or 

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:55.900
 we go knowing and working in the way 

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:55.900
 in which we go horns 

00:00:58.240 --> 00:01:02.870
 where expectations pass with 

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:04.760
 this game with quilmes taking in 

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:05.540
 account that is of visitor and that in that 

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:06.830
 condition 

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:09.080
 Central has been getting the best 

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:10.790
 results in the tournament much better than 

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:12.740
 the local Ivan with certain 

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:15.970
 quiet when it's time to leave the 

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:18.460
 giant but like all parties 

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:21.530
 we know that it is a very important match 

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:24.020
 for our goal and good the 

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:27.200
 true that it's going to be a tough match that 

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:28.940
 sound like a good match so 

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:30.619
 we will try to do our best to 

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:32.090
 bring us the three points you have in 

00:01:30.619 --> 00:01:33.590
 account that they are winning 

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:35.119
 in the last three games they played 

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:36.740
 two wine producers for the glass or van 

00:01:35.119 --> 00:01:38.110
 to play is the same as against any 

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:40.690
 another up 

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:43.210
 if you keep in mind because they are going to come 

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:46.030
 well it makes you have more confidence and good 

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:48.430
 we also think that we think about the 

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:50.740
 party that we have at home we are going 

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:52.540
 to be a hard court is going to be a 

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:54.820
 difficult match but good we will try 

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:56.710
 do your best as from the other 

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:58.690
 Once the little one was pondered 

00:01:56.710 --> 00:02:00.729
 quilmes was to think that you can 

00:01:58.690 --> 00:02:02.920
 favor it rice the central one that 

00:02:00.729 --> 00:02:06.220
 propose or that the previous one seems to be going 

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:08.470
 propose yes yes obviously that was born 

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:10.960
 of hands other because good 

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:13.090
 they know how to play we are going to go 

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:15.040
 as we always do in all 

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:17.980
 courts tries to make our game yes 

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:20.440
 good was a result that good that 

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:21.760
 we get the impression is that the table does not 

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:23.410
 lie that those above are the 

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:26.380
 protagonists of the championship 

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:29.140
 what this central achieved also where 

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:31.030
 where you feel that you are where you weigh the 

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:33.670
 difference when the 

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:37.510
 margin of error is shrinking and 

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:42.970
 obviously here is very little that the 

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:45.700
 final straight we do not have a possible and 

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:49.450
 good that they have started match very 

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:51.640
 important how good you have to try to 

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:53.530
 do it very well franco everything indicates that 

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:54.970
 the thin chelito is not going to play I'm going to 

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:56.500
 baxe imagining where you can touch 

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:59.320
 play because you have changed position 

00:02:56.500 --> 00:03:01.600
 during the tournament you go thinking about it you go 

00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:05.510
 imagining something 

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:07.879
 that's not it and technician will say 

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:09.769
 I'm training with all the 

00:03:07.879 --> 00:03:14.110
 comrades and good where I play 

00:03:09.769 --> 00:03:14.110
 If I have to try to do my best
