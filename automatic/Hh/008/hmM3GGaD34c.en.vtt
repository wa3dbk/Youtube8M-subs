change<00:00:42.960> I<00:00:43.140> reckon<00:00:43.590> there<00:00:44.460> cuz<00:00:44.910> he's<00:00:45.210> predicted

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:45.690 
change I reckon there cuz he's predicted

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:47.270

to<00:00:45.780> have<00:00:45.930> high<00:00:46.110> dribbling<00:00:46.590> and<00:00:46.770> he<00:00:46.920> does<00:00:47.129> do<00:00:47.250> a

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680 
lot of skill in games so I reckon the

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:51.380 
lot of skill in games so I reckon the
next<00:00:49.980> year<00:00:50.129> is<00:00:50.190> gonna<00:00:50.309> have<00:00:50.579> a<00:00:50.789> five<00:00:51.090> stars

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:08.060 
you've seen videos of them you will

understand why he's very selfish because

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:10.250 
understand why he's very selfish because
he<00:01:08.220> can<00:01:08.369> see<00:01:08.640> his<00:01:09.299> teammates<00:01:09.810> getting<00:01:10.020> quite

he can see his teammates getting quite
annoyed<00:01:10.560> with<00:01:10.740> him<00:01:10.830> and<00:01:10.950> frustrated<00:01:11.510> when

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
annoyed with him and frustrated when

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:15.200 
annoyed with him and frustrated when
because<00:01:13.189> from<00:01:14.189> the<00:01:14.310> videos<00:01:14.549> I've<00:01:14.700> seen<00:01:14.729> there

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
because from the videos I've seen there

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:16.940 
because from the videos I've seen there
would<00:01:15.299> be<00:01:15.330> numerous<00:01:15.810> times<00:01:16.350> where<00:01:16.680> he<00:01:16.770> could

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
would be numerous times where he could

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:18.440 
would be numerous times where he could
have<00:01:17.040> just<00:01:17.189> chips<00:01:17.490> it<00:01:17.610> across<00:01:17.820> the<00:01:18.000> box<00:01:18.210> and

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
have just chips it across the box and

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:21.010 
have just chips it across the box and
the<00:01:19.110> his<00:01:19.470> teammate<00:01:20.340> would<00:01:20.430> have<00:01:20.549> scored<00:01:20.850> but

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:21.020 
the his teammate would have scored but

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:23.600 
the his teammate would have scored but
he's<00:01:22.020> gone<00:01:22.200> for<00:01:22.380> himself<00:01:22.740> and<00:01:22.979> it<00:01:23.400> hasn't

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 
he's gone for himself and it hasn't

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:25.249 
he's gone for himself and it hasn't
really<00:01:23.880> worked<00:01:24.030> out<00:01:24.479> because<00:01:24.720> the<00:01:24.930> keepers

00:01:25.249 --> 00:01:25.259 
really worked out because the keepers

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:28.070 
really worked out because the keepers
just<00:01:25.290> deflected<00:01:25.890> it<00:01:26.009> so<00:01:26.759> he's<00:01:27.540> a<00:01:27.570> one<00:01:27.840> glove

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080 
just deflected it so he's a one glove

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:30.140 
just deflected it so he's a one glove
player<00:01:28.320> so<00:01:28.979> that's<00:01:29.220> likely<00:01:29.670> to<00:01:29.790> mean<00:01:29.909> that<00:01:30.060> if

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.150 
player so that's likely to mean that if

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:32.179 
player so that's likely to mean that if
he<00:01:30.299> does<00:01:30.509> move<00:01:30.720> and<00:01:30.990> I<00:01:31.110> doubt<00:01:31.439> he'll<00:01:31.650> move<00:01:31.860> for

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:32.189 
he does move and I doubt he'll move for

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:34.520 
he does move and I doubt he'll move for
a<00:01:32.220> couple<00:01:32.430> years<00:01:32.930> he'll<00:01:33.930> only<00:01:34.110> go<00:01:34.350> to<00:01:34.409> about

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530 
a couple years he'll only go to about

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:36.319 
a couple years he'll only go to about
one<00:01:34.829> or<00:01:34.950> two<00:01:34.979> clubs<00:01:35.460> which<00:01:35.610> I<00:01:35.759> like<00:01:35.909> to<00:01:36.060> see<00:01:36.240> him

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:36.329 
one or two clubs which I like to see him

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:39.740 
one or two clubs which I like to see him
players<00:01:36.740> so<00:01:37.740> at<00:01:38.040> the<00:01:38.189> moment<00:01:38.340> he<00:01:38.610> costs<00:01:39.150> around

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750 
players so at the moment he costs around

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:41.840 
players so at the moment he costs around
about<00:01:40.140> eight<00:01:40.380> hundred<00:01:40.590> twenty-five<00:01:41.310> thousand

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
about eight hundred twenty-five thousand

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:45.139 
about eight hundred twenty-five thousand
and<00:01:42.060> I'm<00:01:42.299> actually<00:01:42.780> really<00:01:43.110> surprised<00:01:43.799> at<00:01:44.149> the

00:01:45.139 --> 00:01:45.149 
and I'm actually really surprised at the

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:46.850 
and I'm actually really surprised at the
bigger<00:01:45.390> clubs<00:01:45.780> like<00:01:46.020> money<00:01:46.290> night<00:01:46.500> and<00:01:46.680> one

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:46.860 
bigger clubs like money night and one

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:49.399 
bigger clubs like money night and one
City<00:01:47.100> haven't<00:01:48.000> picked<00:01:48.570> him<00:01:48.780> up<00:01:48.869> already

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:49.409 
City haven't picked him up already

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:52.429 
City haven't picked him up already
there<00:01:50.220> was<00:01:50.310> a<00:01:50.340> rumors<00:01:50.790> saying<00:01:51.060> that<00:01:51.200> Man<00:01:52.200> City

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:52.439 
there was a rumors saying that Man City

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:55.160 
there was a rumors saying that Man City
did<00:01:52.799> put<00:01:53.430> in<00:01:53.520> an<00:01:53.640> offer<00:01:53.759> for<00:01:53.939> him<00:01:54.299> and<00:01:54.509> in<00:01:54.899> the

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:55.170 
did put in an offer for him and in the

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:57.080 
did put in an offer for him and in the
summer<00:01:55.500> transfer<00:01:55.799> window<00:01:55.950> but<00:01:56.430> I<00:01:56.579> believe<00:01:56.969> he

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:57.090 
summer transfer window but I believe he

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:00.649 
summer transfer window but I believe he
rejected<00:01:57.659> it<00:01:58.310> so<00:01:59.310> in<00:01:59.729> the<00:02:00.030> next<00:02:00.299> couple<00:02:00.509> years

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:00.659 
rejected it so in the next couple years

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:02.179 
rejected it so in the next couple years
I<00:02:00.869> reckon<00:02:01.259> that<00:02:01.380> his<00:02:01.469> price<00:02:01.740> will<00:02:01.979> just

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:02.189 
I reckon that his price will just

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:05.389 
I reckon that his price will just
skyrocket<00:02:03.030> and<00:02:03.149> go<00:02:03.270> just<00:02:03.509> absolutely<00:02:04.399> crazy

00:02:05.389 --> 00:02:05.399 
skyrocket and go just absolutely crazy

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:08.230 
skyrocket and go just absolutely crazy
high<00:02:05.850> like<00:02:06.119> I<00:02:06.299> reckon<00:02:06.689> next<00:02:06.960> year

00:02:08.230 --> 00:02:08.240 
high like I reckon next year

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:09.520 
high like I reckon next year
depending<00:02:08.570> on<00:02:08.660> how<00:02:08.780> the<00:02:08.840> season<00:02:09.230> goes<00:02:09.380> is

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:09.530 
depending on how the season goes is

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:11.380 
depending on how the season goes is
gonna<00:02:09.740> be<00:02:09.860> worth<00:02:10.010> a<00:02:10.160> couple<00:02:10.190> mil<00:02:10.640> I'd<00:02:10.850> probably

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:11.390 
gonna be worth a couple mil I'd probably

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:13.950 
gonna be worth a couple mil I'd probably
say<00:02:11.990> he'll<00:02:12.770> be<00:02:12.860> worth<00:02:13.010> about<00:02:13.190> five<00:02:13.550> million

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:13.960 
say he'll be worth about five million

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:17.050 
say he'll be worth about five million
next<00:02:14.960> year<00:02:15.170> I'd<00:02:15.590> say<00:02:15.620> be<00:02:16.010> ill<00:02:16.250> double<00:02:16.580> so<00:02:17.000> be

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:17.060 
next year I'd say be ill double so be

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:20.080 
next year I'd say be ill double so be
worth<00:02:17.240> about<00:02:17.450> ten<00:02:17.750> million<00:02:18.190> so<00:02:19.190> Butthead<00:02:19.880> I

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:20.090 
worth about ten million so Butthead I

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:22.210 
worth about ten million so Butthead I
got<00:02:20.420> the<00:02:20.630> potential<00:02:21.140> rating<00:02:21.680> on<00:02:21.800> foot<00:02:22.040> head

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:22.220 
got the potential rating on foot head

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:25.540 
got the potential rating on foot head
but<00:02:22.490> I<00:02:22.820> did<00:02:23.330> all<00:02:23.480> the<00:02:23.750> stats<00:02:24.380> myself<00:02:24.980> I<00:02:25.250> watched

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:25.550 
but I did all the stats myself I watched

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:28.510 
but I did all the stats myself I watched
a<00:02:25.700> couple<00:02:25.730> videos<00:02:26.030> and<00:02:26.800> watched<00:02:27.800> how<00:02:28.040> he<00:02:28.100> plays

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:28.520 
a couple videos and watched how he plays

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:31.510 
a couple videos and watched how he plays
and<00:02:29.050> he's<00:02:30.050> quite<00:02:30.290> fast<00:02:30.620> so<00:02:30.740> I<00:02:30.830> do<00:02:30.920> reckon<00:02:31.460> he

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:31.520 
and he's quite fast so I do reckon he

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:33.940 
and he's quite fast so I do reckon he
does<00:02:31.700> deserve<00:02:31.880> the<00:02:32.180> 90<00:02:32.510> pace<00:02:32.720> and<00:02:32.960> the<00:02:33.650> nightly

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:33.950 
does deserve the 90 pace and the nightly

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:35.590 
does deserve the 90 pace and the nightly
trouble<00:02:34.280> cuz<00:02:34.460> he<00:02:34.580> is<00:02:34.640> he<00:02:34.880> is<00:02:35.000> a<00:02:35.030> dribbler<00:02:35.480> and

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:35.600 
trouble cuz he is he is a dribbler and

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:37.270 
trouble cuz he is he is a dribbler and
he's<00:02:35.690> very<00:02:35.840> good<00:02:36.080> at<00:02:36.170> it<00:02:36.350> so<00:02:36.620> he<00:02:36.770> just<00:02:36.800> deserved

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:37.280 
he's very good at it so he just deserved

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:38.340 
he's very good at it so he just deserved
a<00:02:37.370> 90<00:02:37.700> dribble

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:38.350 
a 90 dribble

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:42.130 
a 90 dribble

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:46.760 
his potential card it's likely to change

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:48.430 
his potential card it's likely to change
in<00:02:46.940> the<00:02:47.030> future<00:02:47.180> kids<00:02:47.600> it's<00:02:47.870> just<00:02:48.020> a

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:48.440 
in the future kids it's just a

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:51.940 
in the future kids it's just a
prediction<00:02:49.220> so<00:02:50.030> he<00:02:50.120> may<00:02:50.270> be<00:02:50.300> like<00:02:50.630> 89<00:02:51.230> rated<00:02:51.680> or

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:51.950 
prediction so he may be like 89 rated or

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:54.640 
prediction so he may be like 89 rated or
91<00:02:52.610> rated<00:02:53.060> but<00:02:53.630> it's<00:02:53.810> gonna<00:02:54.020> be<00:02:54.200> around<00:02:54.440> that

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:54.650 
91 rated but it's gonna be around that

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:57.370 
91 rated but it's gonna be around that
area<00:02:54.920> and<00:02:55.100> the<00:02:55.340> stats<00:02:55.670> are<00:02:55.880> gonna<00:02:56.000> be<00:02:56.240> a<00:02:56.480> little

00:02:57.370 --> 00:02:57.380 
area and the stats are gonna be a little

00:02:57.380 --> 00:02:59.260 
area and the stats are gonna be a little
bit<00:02:57.650> they're<00:02:58.010> a<00:02:58.040> little<00:02:58.370> bit<00:02:58.580> loose<00:02:58.880> to<00:02:58.910> what

00:02:59.260 --> 00:02:59.270 
bit they're a little bit loose to what

00:02:59.270 --> 00:03:01.270 
bit they're a little bit loose to what
it<00:02:59.330> might<00:02:59.480> actually<00:02:59.720> be<00:03:00.170> so<00:03:00.830> in<00:03:00.920> a<00:03:00.980> couple

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:01.280 
it might actually be so in a couple

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:02.770 
it might actually be so in a couple
years<00:03:01.310> time<00:03:01.670> to<00:03:01.880> go<00:03:02.060> back<00:03:02.240> to<00:03:02.300> this<00:03:02.450> video<00:03:02.630> and
