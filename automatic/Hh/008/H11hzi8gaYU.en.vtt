touch any other boxes now women's brains

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:09.840 
touch any other boxes now women's brains
are<00:01:08.270> very<00:01:08.479> very<00:01:08.780> different<00:01:09.020> for<00:01:09.350> men's<00:01:09.530> race

are very very different for men's race
women's<00:01:10.850> brains<00:01:11.090> are<00:01:11.360> made<00:01:11.570> up<00:01:11.690> of<00:01:11.780> a<00:01:11.930> big<00:01:12.170> ball

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:12.590 
women's brains are made up of a big ball

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:18.790 
women's brains are made up of a big ball
of<00:01:12.619> wire<00:01:13.840> and<00:01:15.640> everything<00:01:16.640> is<00:01:17.240> connected<00:01:17.810> to

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:18.800 
of wire and everything is connected to

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:22.300 
of wire and everything is connected to
everything

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:22.310 

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:31.850 

there's<00:01:23.310> a<00:01:23.369> car<00:01:23.579> the<00:01:23.820> cars<00:01:24.030> gonna<00:01:24.210> do<00:01:24.420> your<00:01:24.570> job

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:35.030 

and<00:01:32.850> it's<00:01:33.030> all<00:01:33.240> driven<00:01:33.600> by<00:01:33.750> energy<00:01:34.440> that<00:01:34.920> we

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.040 
and it's all driven by energy that we

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:40.060 
and it's all driven by energy that we
call<00:01:35.250> emotion

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:40.070 

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:43.790 

it's<00:01:41.070> one<00:01:41.520> of<00:01:41.670> the<00:01:41.850> reasons<00:01:42.420> my<00:01:42.600> women<00:01:43.170> tends

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:43.800 
it's one of the reasons my women tends

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:50.780 
it's one of the reasons my women tends
to<00:01:44.100> remember<00:01:48.020> because<00:01:49.020> if<00:01:49.950> you<00:01:50.160> take<00:01:50.430> an<00:01:50.640> event

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:50.790 
to remember because if you take an event

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:53.840 
to remember because if you take an event
and<00:01:51.450> you<00:01:52.110> connect<00:01:52.530> it<00:01:52.680> to<00:01:52.710> an<00:01:53.010> emotion<00:01:53.520> it

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:53.850 
and you connect it to an emotion it

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:55.610 
and you connect it to an emotion it
burns<00:01:54.330> in<00:01:54.720> your<00:01:54.870> memory<00:01:55.200> and<00:01:55.410> you<00:01:55.590> can

00:01:55.610 --> 00:01:55.620 
burns in your memory and you can

00:01:55.620 --> 00:01:57.770 
burns in your memory and you can
remember<00:01:56.040> forever<00:01:56.280> the<00:01:57.090> same<00:01:57.300> thing<00:01:57.479> happens

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:57.780

remember forever the same thing happens
for<00:01:57.990> men<00:01:58.140> it<00:01:58.350> just<00:01:58.560> doesn't<00:01:58.800> happen<00:01:58.890> very

00:01:59.060 --> 00:01:59.070 
for men it just doesn't happen very

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:01.340
