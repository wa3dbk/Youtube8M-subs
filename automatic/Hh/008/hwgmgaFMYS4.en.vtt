00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:26.660 
machine or my machine I made these thick

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:28.360 
machine or my machine I made these thick
chocolate<00:01:26.840> for<00:01:27.290> my<00:01:27.380> machine<00:01:27.560> because<00:01:28.160> I

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:28.370 
chocolate for my machine because I

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:30.940 
chocolate for my machine because I
couldn't<00:01:28.760> find<00:01:29.000> any<00:01:29.240> like<00:01:29.630> skinny<00:01:30.140> objects<00:01:30.770> to

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:30.950 
couldn't find any like skinny objects to

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:34.960 
couldn't find any like skinny objects to
fit<00:01:31.130> in<00:01:31.250> between<00:01:31.370> each<00:01:32.740> coil<00:01:33.740> now<00:01:34.340> all<00:01:34.670> three

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:34.970 
fit in between each coil now all three

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:39.010 
fit in between each coil now all three
places<00:01:35.210> are<00:01:35.600> filled<00:01:35.780> up<00:01:37.390> so<00:01:38.390> you<00:01:38.480> know<00:01:38.660> it's<00:01:38.870> on

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:39.020 
places are filled up so you know it's on

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:41.650 
places are filled up so you know it's on
because<00:01:39.320> there's<00:01:40.160> a<00:01:40.280> red<00:01:40.700> light<00:01:40.940> inside<00:01:41.360> when

00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:41.660 
because there's a red light inside when

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:44.020 
because there's a red light inside when
I<00:01:41.690> turn<00:01:41.990> it<00:01:42.140> on<00:01:42.290> and<00:01:42.800> you<00:01:43.490> might<00:01:43.670> think<00:01:43.910> the

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:44.030 
I turn it on and you might think the

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:47.260 
I turn it on and you might think the
button<00:01:44.420> is<00:01:44.540> backwards<00:01:45.170> and<00:01:45.440> it<00:01:46.250> is<00:01:46.550> because<00:01:47.030> I

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:47.270 
button is backwards and it is because I

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:49.510 
button is backwards and it is because I
couldn't<00:01:47.690> like<00:01:47.870> put<00:01:48.680> it<00:01:48.770> forward<00:01:49.130> because<00:01:49.250> if

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:49.520 
couldn't like put it forward because if

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:51.219 
couldn't like put it forward because if
I<00:01:49.610> put<00:01:49.820> it<00:01:49.910> forward<00:01:50.240> the<00:01:50.510> water<00:01:50.750> will<00:01:50.990> go<00:01:51.170> to

00:01:51.219 --> 00:01:51.229 
I put it forward the water will go to

00:01:51.229 --> 00:01:53.770 
I put it forward the water will go to
the<00:01:51.530> right<00:01:51.710> instead<00:01:51.979> of<00:01:52.220> the<00:01:52.280> left<00:01:52.400> and<00:01:52.880> I

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:53.780 
the right instead of the left and I

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:55.300 
the right instead of the left and I
needed<00:01:53.990> the<00:01:54.170> wire<00:01:54.320> to<00:01:54.470> go<00:01:54.590> to<00:01:54.650> the<00:01:54.860> left<00:01:55.040> so<00:01:55.250> I

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:55.310 
needed the wire to go to the left so I

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:57.880 
needed the wire to go to the left so I
could<00:01:55.490> connect<00:01:55.820> it<00:01:55.970> to<00:01:56.180> this<00:01:57.050> thing<00:01:57.380> couldn't

00:01:57.880 --> 00:01:57.890 
could connect it to this thing couldn't

00:01:57.890 --> 00:01:59.320 
could connect it to this thing couldn't
make<00:01:58.010> this<00:01:58.130> vending<00:01:58.580> machine<00:01:58.850> work<00:01:59.090> with

00:01:59.320 --> 00:01:59.330 
make this vending machine work with

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:01.510 
make this vending machine work with
money<00:01:59.600> so<00:01:59.960> I<00:02:00.260> made<00:02:00.650> it<00:02:00.770> work<00:02:01.010> with<00:02:01.250> white

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:01.520 
money so I made it work with white

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:04.780 
money so I made it work with white
instead<00:02:02.080> so<00:02:03.080> you<00:02:03.170> have<00:02:03.350> to<00:02:03.530> flash<00:02:04.040> a<00:02:04.250> light<00:02:04.520> in

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:04.790 
instead so you have to flash a light in

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:07.359 
instead so you have to flash a light in
the<00:02:04.940> hole<00:02:05.150> to<00:02:05.360> work<00:02:05.540> instead<00:02:06.080> of<00:02:06.229> paying<00:02:07.130> money

00:02:07.359 --> 00:02:07.369 
the hole to work instead of paying money

00:02:07.369 --> 00:02:11.110 
the hole to work instead of paying money
I<00:02:07.750> thought<00:02:08.750> of<00:02:09.020> a<00:02:09.350> whole<00:02:09.770> bunch<00:02:09.920> of<00:02:10.130> ways<00:02:10.340> that

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:11.120 
I thought of a whole bunch of ways that

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:13.690 
I thought of a whole bunch of ways that
I<00:02:11.180> could<00:02:11.270> work<00:02:11.480> with<00:02:11.650> money<00:02:12.650> but<00:02:13.070> it<00:02:13.370> just

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:13.700 
I could work with money but it just

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:15.790 
I could work with money but it just
wasn't<00:02:13.910> working<00:02:14.330> out<00:02:14.540> and<00:02:14.900> it<00:02:15.350> was<00:02:15.470> just<00:02:15.650> way

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:15.800 
wasn't working out and it was just way

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:17.710 
wasn't working out and it was just way
too<00:02:15.830> complicated<00:02:16.160> and<00:02:17.090> though<00:02:17.239> there's<00:02:17.510> light

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:17.720 
too complicated and though there's light

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:21.880 
too complicated and though there's light
inside<00:02:18.140> it<00:02:18.440> doesn't<00:02:19.400> work<00:02:20.709> you<00:02:21.709> have<00:02:21.739> to

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:21.890 
inside it doesn't work you have to

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:24.970 
inside it doesn't work you have to
actually<00:02:22.190> shine<00:02:22.880> a<00:02:23.120> light<00:02:23.630> at<00:02:23.900> it<00:02:24.140> then<00:02:24.650> your

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:24.980 
actually shine a light at it then your

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:32.770 
actually shine a light at it then your
machine<00:02:25.130> will<00:02:25.670> work<00:02:30.280> and<00:02:31.360> I<00:02:32.360> fell<00:02:32.750> down

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:32.780 
machine will work and I fell down

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:39.030 
machine will work and I fell down
through<00:02:33.380> here<00:02:33.610> and<00:02:35.860> if<00:02:36.860> you<00:02:37.100> remove<00:02:37.580> the<00:02:37.820> light

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:39.040 
through here and if you remove the light

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:44.410 
through here and if you remove the light
again<00:02:40.040> it<00:02:40.310> will<00:02:40.580> not<00:02:40.640> work<00:02:42.910> as<00:02:43.910> you<00:02:44.060> can<00:02:44.180> see<00:02:44.330> it

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:44.420 
again it will not work as you can see it

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:47.020 
again it will not work as you can see it
doesn't<00:02:44.540> work<00:02:44.690> without<00:02:45.019> light<00:02:45.760> back<00:02:46.760> with

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:47.030 
doesn't work without light back with

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:53.410 
doesn't work without light back with
light<00:02:47.950> it<00:02:48.950> works<00:02:50.800> and<00:02:51.850> they<00:02:52.850> get<00:02:53.030> stuck

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:53.420 
light it works and they get stuck

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:56.890 
light it works and they get stuck
because<00:02:53.660> um<00:02:54.730> this<00:02:55.730> plastic<00:02:56.450> part<00:02:56.600> keeps

00:02:56.890 --> 00:02:56.900 
because um this plastic part keeps

00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:58.030 
because um this plastic part keeps
getting<00:02:57.230> in<00:02:57.320> the<00:02:57.350> way<00:02:57.440> when<00:02:57.709> it's<00:02:57.860> falling

00:02:58.030 --> 00:02:58.040 
getting in the way when it's falling

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:05.280 
getting in the way when it's falling
down

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:05.290 

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:08.770 

and<00:03:06.909> I'm<00:03:07.909> just<00:03:08.060> not<00:03:08.180> good<00:03:08.480> at<00:03:08.510> decorating

00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:08.780 
and I'm just not good at decorating

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:10.630 
and I'm just not good at decorating
that's<00:03:09.349> what<00:03:09.470> it<00:03:09.560> looks<00:03:09.680> kind<00:03:09.980> of<00:03:10.040> like<00:03:10.280> a<00:03:10.310> mess

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:10.640 
that's what it looks kind of like a mess

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:13.000 
that's what it looks kind of like a mess
so<00:03:11.090> this<00:03:11.120> is<00:03:11.480> basically<00:03:11.900> it<00:03:12.170> and<00:03:12.349> I'll<00:03:12.650> go<00:03:12.830> into

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:13.010 
so this is basically it and I'll go into

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:18.240 
so this is basically it and I'll go into
the<00:03:13.310> tutorial<00:03:13.730> now

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:18.250 

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:25.290 

this<00:03:18.850> is<00:03:19.090> build<00:03:19.360> it<00:03:23.640> and<00:03:24.640> the<00:03:24.760> back<00:03:24.940> has<00:03:25.120> like<00:03:25.270> a

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:25.300 
this is build it and the back has like a

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:26.490 
this is build it and the back has like a
magnet<00:03:25.630> so<00:03:25.750> you<00:03:25.870> could<00:03:25.990> close<00:03:26.110> it<00:03:26.230> back<00:03:26.320> easily

00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:26.500 
magnet so you could close it back easily

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:27.390 
magnet so you could close it back easily
and<00:03:26.890> okay

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:27.400 
and okay

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:29.660 
and okay
and<00:03:27.880> if<00:03:28.060> I<00:03:28.120> open<00:03:28.300> it<00:03:28.510> it<00:03:28.660> comes<00:03:28.870> with<00:03:29.080> a<00:03:29.260> paper

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:29.670 
and if I open it it comes with a paper

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:31.830 
and if I open it it comes with a paper
and<00:03:30.670> it<00:03:30.790> just<00:03:30.940> talked<00:03:31.120> about<00:03:31.180> how<00:03:31.540> to<00:03:31.600> put

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:31.840 
and it just talked about how to put

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:35.790 
and it just talked about how to put
together<00:03:32.020> and<00:03:32.530> and<00:03:34.020> let<00:03:35.020> it<00:03:35.170> comes<00:03:35.440> with<00:03:35.560> a<00:03:35.650> key

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:35.800 
together and and let it comes with a key

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:37.920 
together and and let it comes with a key
and<00:03:36.070> I<00:03:36.700> think<00:03:36.970> you<00:03:37.060> could<00:03:37.240> build<00:03:37.360> entrance

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:37.930 
and I think you could build entrance

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:39.110 
and I think you could build entrance
okay

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:39.120 
okay

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:42.870 
okay

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:16.570 
havoc and with this when I turn it as

00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:18.900

see<00:04:20.890> if<00:04:20.980> I<00:04:21.070> want<00:04:21.250> to<00:04:21.310> put<00:04:21.430> a<00:04:21.549> buzzer<00:04:21.850> in<00:04:22.000> then<00:04:22.360> I

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:22.480 
see if I want to put a buzzer in then I

00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:28.650 
see if I want to put a buzzer in then I
put<00:04:22.750> this<00:04:22.900> buzzer<00:04:23.200> in<00:04:27.090> but<00:04:28.090> when<00:04:28.270> I<00:04:28.300> turn<00:04:28.510> it<00:04:28.540> in

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:28.660 
put this buzzer in but when I turn it in

00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:32.280 
put this buzzer in but when I turn it in
you<00:04:28.750> can<00:04:29.020> see<00:04:29.140> that<00:04:29.290> mixed<00:04:29.590> noise<00:04:29.770> I<00:04:31.260> put<00:04:32.260> a

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:32.290 
you can see that mixed noise I put a

00:04:32.290 --> 00:04:35.760 
you can see that mixed noise I put a
button<00:04:32.590> and<00:04:32.980> a<00:04:33.160> light<00:04:33.340> and<00:04:33.870> then<00:04:34.870> light<00:04:35.410> turns

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:35.770 
button and a light and then light turns

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:40.250 
button and a light and then light turns
on

00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:40.260 

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:43.760 

you'll<00:04:40.800> be<00:04:40.890> needing<00:04:41.100> a<00:04:41.370> battery<00:04:41.760> power<00:04:42.770> flight

00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:43.770 
you'll be needing a battery power flight

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:47.900 
you'll be needing a battery power flight
sensor<00:04:44.280> wire<00:04:45.210> to<00:04:45.570> separate<00:04:46.250> all<00:04:47.250> the<00:04:47.460> pieces

00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:47.910 
sensor wire to separate all the pieces

00:04:47.910 --> 00:04:50.020 
sensor wire to separate all the pieces
but<00:04:48.330> you<00:04:48.390> guys<00:04:48.720> don't<00:04:48.990> have<00:04:49.050> to<00:04:49.290> use<00:04:49.410> a<00:04:49.440> wire<00:04:49.710> a

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:50.030 
but you guys don't have to use a wire a

00:04:50.030 --> 00:04:54.680 
but you guys don't have to use a wire a
button<00:04:51.030> another<00:04:51.960> wire<00:04:52.200> and<00:04:52.560> a<00:04:52.590> motor<00:04:53.480> you<00:04:54.480> want

00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:54.690 
button another wire and a motor you want

00:04:54.690 --> 00:04:56.720 
button another wire and a motor you want
to<00:04:54.810> set<00:04:55.020> your<00:04:55.170> light<00:04:55.380> sensor<00:04:55.770> to<00:04:55.800> dark<00:04:56.370> mode

00:04:56.720 --> 00:04:56.730 
to set your light sensor to dark mode

00:04:56.730 --> 00:04:58.850 
to set your light sensor to dark mode
because<00:04:57.660> we<00:04:57.900> chose<00:04:58.050> a<00:04:58.140> light<00:04:58.320> mode<00:04:58.560> then

00:04:58.850 --> 00:04:58.860 
because we chose a light mode then

00:04:58.860 --> 00:05:01.400 
because we chose a light mode then
you're<00:04:59.220> going<00:04:59.400> to<00:04:59.520> need<00:04:59.670> some<00:04:59.910> Sun<00:05:00.240> power<00:05:00.420> so

00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:01.410 
you're going to need some Sun power so

00:05:01.410 --> 00:05:05.960 
you're going to need some Sun power so
switch<00:05:02.070> the<00:05:02.700> light<00:05:03.090> to<00:05:03.450> dark<00:05:04.580> how<00:05:05.580> it<00:05:05.790> will

00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:05.970 
switch the light to dark how it will

00:05:05.970 --> 00:05:09.440 
switch the light to dark how it will
work<00:05:06.240> is<00:05:06.510> when<00:05:07.410> you<00:05:07.500> press<00:05:07.650> the<00:05:07.830> button<00:05:08.450> the

00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:09.450 
work is when you press the button the

00:05:09.450 --> 00:05:11.390 
work is when you press the button the
motor<00:05:09.660> will<00:05:09.930> spit<00:05:10.170> but<00:05:10.560> when<00:05:10.710> it's<00:05:10.860> dark<00:05:11.130> and

00:05:11.390 --> 00:05:11.400 
motor will spit but when it's dark and

00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:13.040 
motor will spit but when it's dark and
I'm<00:05:11.610> just<00:05:11.820> covering<00:05:12.150> the<00:05:12.300> sensor<00:05:12.660> so<00:05:12.840> it's

00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:13.050 
I'm just covering the sensor so it's

00:05:13.050 --> 00:05:15.830 
I'm just covering the sensor so it's
dark<00:05:13.640> when<00:05:14.640> you<00:05:14.730> press<00:05:14.880> the<00:05:15.030> button<00:05:15.390> and<00:05:15.570> won't

00:05:15.830 --> 00:05:15.840 
dark when you press the button and won't

00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:20.090 
dark when you press the button and won't
work<00:05:16.280> again<00:05:17.280> when<00:05:17.490> it's<00:05:17.640> dark<00:05:18.470> it<00:05:19.470> won't<00:05:19.650> work

00:05:20.090 --> 00:05:20.100 
work again when it's dark it won't work

00:05:20.100 --> 00:05:25.370 
work again when it's dark it won't work
when<00:05:20.850> you<00:05:20.940> lift<00:05:21.150> your<00:05:21.180> finger<00:05:22.100> you'll<00:05:23.100> spin<00:05:24.380> so

00:05:25.370 --> 00:05:25.380 
when you lift your finger you'll spin so

00:05:25.380 --> 00:05:28.250 
when you lift your finger you'll spin so
now<00:05:25.560> you<00:05:25.740> just<00:05:25.770> want<00:05:26.100> to<00:05:26.160> get<00:05:26.310> a<00:05:26.490> box<00:05:26.850> and<00:05:27.260> split

00:05:28.250 --> 00:05:28.260 
now you just want to get a box and split

00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:31.700 
now you just want to get a box and split
it<00:05:28.350> into<00:05:28.700> about<00:05:29.700> 1/3<00:05:30.270> now<00:05:30.900> with<00:05:31.260> what<00:05:31.560> I<00:05:31.590> just

00:05:31.700 --> 00:05:31.710 
it into about 1/3 now with what I just

00:05:31.710 --> 00:05:33.740 
it into about 1/3 now with what I just
showed<00:05:32.130> you<00:05:32.160> it<00:05:32.700> looks<00:05:33.000> kind<00:05:33.180> of<00:05:33.210> complicated

00:05:33.740 --> 00:05:33.750 
showed you it looks kind of complicated

00:05:33.750 --> 00:05:35.240 
showed you it looks kind of complicated
but<00:05:33.900> all<00:05:33.990> you<00:05:34.080> do<00:05:34.260> is<00:05:34.440> take<00:05:34.740> the<00:05:34.890> first<00:05:35.070> two

00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:35.250 
but all you do is take the first two

00:05:35.250 --> 00:05:37.460 
but all you do is take the first two
modules<00:05:35.670> which<00:05:35.910> is<00:05:36.090> the<00:05:36.270> power<00:05:36.510> and<00:05:36.810> the<00:05:37.320> light

00:05:37.460 --> 00:05:37.470 
modules which is the power and the light

00:05:37.470 --> 00:05:42.170 
modules which is the power and the light
sensor<00:05:38.510> then<00:05:39.510> you<00:05:40.140> turn<00:05:40.320> it<00:05:40.350> around<00:05:40.620> and<00:05:41.180> poke

00:05:42.170 --> 00:05:42.180 
sensor then you turn it around and poke

00:05:42.180 --> 00:05:44.440 
sensor then you turn it around and poke
a<00:05:42.210> hole<00:05:42.360> where<00:05:42.810> you<00:05:42.870> could<00:05:43.050> put<00:05:43.200> your<00:05:43.410> wire<00:05:43.680> in

00:05:44.440 --> 00:05:44.450 
a hole where you could put your wire in

00:05:44.450 --> 00:05:46.490 
a hole where you could put your wire in
and<00:05:45.450> then<00:05:45.570> that's<00:05:45.690> where<00:05:45.930> your<00:05:46.020> button<00:05:46.350> will

00:05:46.490 --> 00:05:46.500 
and then that's where your button will

00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:48.260 
and then that's where your button will
be<00:05:46.620> and<00:05:46.800> you<00:05:46.860> could<00:05:47.010> tape<00:05:47.220> it<00:05:47.340> on<00:05:47.490> and<00:05:47.760> then

00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:48.270 
be and you could tape it on and then

00:05:48.270 --> 00:05:51.650 
be and you could tape it on and then
like<00:05:48.540> cover<00:05:48.870> the<00:05:49.440> whole<00:05:50.340> module<00:05:51.180> so<00:05:51.420> you<00:05:51.510> can

00:05:51.650 --> 00:05:51.660 
like cover the whole module so you can

00:05:51.660 --> 00:05:53.720 
like cover the whole module so you can
only<00:05:51.750> see<00:05:51.930> the<00:05:52.050> button<00:05:52.380> and<00:05:52.620> then<00:05:53.430> poke

00:05:53.720 --> 00:05:53.730 
only see the button and then poke

00:05:53.730 --> 00:05:55.010 
only see the button and then poke
another<00:05:53.880> hole<00:05:54.240> where<00:05:54.450> you<00:05:54.510> could<00:05:54.690> put<00:05:54.870> the

00:05:55.010 --> 00:05:55.020 
another hole where you could put the

00:05:55.020 --> 00:06:00.830 
another hole where you could put the
wire<00:05:57.980> where<00:05:58.980> the<00:05:59.760> motor<00:06:00.000> will<00:06:00.270> be<00:06:00.300> sitting

00:06:00.830 --> 00:06:00.840 
wire where the motor will be sitting

00:06:00.840 --> 00:06:04.430 
wire where the motor will be sitting
right<00:06:00.870> here<00:06:02.420> you<00:06:03.420> don't<00:06:03.540> have<00:06:03.660> to<00:06:04.050> do<00:06:04.170> exactly

00:06:04.430 --> 00:06:04.440 
right here you don't have to do exactly

00:06:04.440 --> 00:06:07.130 
right here you don't have to do exactly
like<00:06:04.650> I<00:06:04.980> did<00:06:05.190> I<00:06:05.400> could<00:06:05.610> poke<00:06:05.910> a<00:06:05.940> hole<00:06:06.030> like<00:06:06.540> here

00:06:07.130 --> 00:06:07.140 
like I did I could poke a hole like here

00:06:07.140 --> 00:06:10.270 
like I did I could poke a hole like here
anywhere<00:06:07.650> so<00:06:08.010> the<00:06:09.000> button<00:06:09.360> could<00:06:09.600> be<00:06:09.720> higher

00:06:10.270 --> 00:06:10.280 
anywhere so the button could be higher

00:06:10.280 --> 00:06:13.690 
anywhere so the button could be higher
now<00:06:11.280> you<00:06:11.340> want<00:06:11.550> to<00:06:11.610> poke<00:06:11.790> a<00:06:11.820> hole<00:06:11.940> so<00:06:12.870> that<00:06:13.260> um

00:06:13.690 --> 00:06:13.700 
now you want to poke a hole so that um

00:06:13.700 --> 00:06:15.920 
now you want to poke a hole so that um
light<00:06:14.700> will<00:06:14.910> get<00:06:15.120> through<00:06:15.420> to<00:06:15.630> your<00:06:15.750> light

00:06:15.920 --> 00:06:15.930 
light will get through to your light

00:06:15.930 --> 00:06:18.110 
light will get through to your light
sensor<00:06:16.440> and<00:06:16.680> you're<00:06:17.610> going<00:06:17.790> to<00:06:17.850> have<00:06:17.970> to

00:06:18.110 --> 00:06:18.120 
sensor and you're going to have to

00:06:18.120 --> 00:06:21.440 
sensor and you're going to have to
adjust<00:06:18.420> the<00:06:18.630> sensitivity<00:06:18.960> of<00:06:19.670> the<00:06:20.670> darkness

00:06:21.440 --> 00:06:21.450 
adjust the sensitivity of the darkness

00:06:21.450 --> 00:06:24.920 
adjust the sensitivity of the darkness
because<00:06:22.200> if<00:06:22.560> it's<00:06:23.280> too<00:06:23.580> sensitive<00:06:23.820> then<00:06:24.480> it

00:06:24.920 --> 00:06:24.930 
because if it's too sensitive then it

00:06:24.930 --> 00:06:27.020 
because if it's too sensitive then it
won't<00:06:25.170> work<00:06:25.320> out<00:06:25.620> and<00:06:25.890> if<00:06:26.430> it's<00:06:26.580> not<00:06:26.760> too

00:06:27.020 --> 00:06:27.030 
won't work out and if it's not too

00:06:27.030 --> 00:06:29.090 
won't work out and if it's not too
sensitive<00:06:27.360> and<00:06:27.840> it<00:06:28.290> still<00:06:28.560> won't<00:06:28.680> work<00:06:28.800> out

00:06:29.090 --> 00:06:29.100 
sensitive and it still won't work out

00:06:29.100 --> 00:06:31.160 
sensitive and it still won't work out
you<00:06:29.640> need<00:06:29.790> to<00:06:29.820> just<00:06:30.120> kind<00:06:30.390> of<00:06:30.480> test<00:06:30.750> it<00:06:30.900> around

00:06:31.160 --> 00:06:31.170 
you need to just kind of test it around

00:06:31.170 --> 00:06:33.080 
you need to just kind of test it around
to<00:06:31.500> see<00:06:31.710> what<00:06:31.920> will<00:06:32.070> be<00:06:32.100> the<00:06:32.430> perfect<00:06:32.850> amount

00:06:33.080 --> 00:06:33.090 
to see what will be the perfect amount

00:06:33.090 --> 00:06:36.200 
to see what will be the perfect amount
of<00:06:33.680> sensitivity<00:06:34.680> to<00:06:34.950> work<00:06:35.280> your<00:06:35.640> machine<00:06:36.030> I

00:06:36.200 --> 00:06:36.210 
of sensitivity to work your machine I

00:06:36.210 --> 00:06:38.570 
of sensitivity to work your machine I
need<00:06:36.600> to<00:06:36.750> do<00:06:36.900> to<00:06:37.290> adjust<00:06:37.620> your<00:06:37.710> sensitivity<00:06:38.400> is

00:06:38.570 --> 00:06:38.580 
need to do to adjust your sensitivity is

00:06:38.580 --> 00:06:42.020 
need to do to adjust your sensitivity is
switch<00:06:39.570> that<00:06:39.840> screw<00:06:40.290> right<00:06:40.470> there<00:06:40.770> the<00:06:41.640> screw

00:06:42.020 --> 00:06:42.030 
switch that screw right there the screw

00:06:42.030 --> 00:06:43.670 
switch that screw right there the screw
there's<00:06:42.660> a<00:06:42.750> label<00:06:42.960> right<00:06:43.290> there<00:06:43.440> same

00:06:43.670 --> 00:06:43.680 
there's a label right there same

00:06:43.680 --> 00:06:45.740 
there's a label right there same
sensitivity<00:06:44.040> if<00:06:44.760> you<00:06:44.910> can<00:06:45.060> see<00:06:45.270> the

00:06:45.740 --> 00:06:45.750 
sensitivity if you can see the

00:06:45.750 --> 00:06:47.600 
sensitivity if you can see the
sensitivity<00:06:46.080> and<00:06:46.620> then<00:06:46.770> there's<00:06:46.950> a<00:06:47.010> screw<00:06:47.280> all

00:06:47.600 --> 00:06:47.610 
sensitivity and then there's a screw all

00:06:47.610 --> 00:06:50.480 
sensitivity and then there's a screw all
I<00:06:47.670> do<00:06:47.850> is<00:06:48.120> twist<00:06:48.390> it<00:06:48.690> and<00:06:48.920> keep<00:06:49.920> on<00:06:50.010> testing<00:06:50.400> it

00:06:50.480 --> 00:06:50.490 
I do is twist it and keep on testing it

00:06:50.490 --> 00:06:53.900 
I do is twist it and keep on testing it
out<00:06:50.720> you<00:06:51.720> can<00:06:51.960> also<00:06:52.140> put<00:06:52.530> a<00:06:52.650> bar<00:06:53.070> graph

00:06:53.900 --> 00:06:53.910 
out you can also put a bar graph

00:06:53.910 --> 00:06:58.850 
out you can also put a bar graph
right<00:06:54.390> on<00:06:54.570> top<00:06:54.840> of<00:06:55.080> the<00:06:55.500> pink<00:06:56.340> thing<00:06:56.610> and<00:06:57.860> that

00:06:58.850 --> 00:06:58.860 
right on top of the pink thing and that

00:06:58.860 --> 00:07:00.320 
right on top of the pink thing and that
will<00:06:59.070> show<00:06:59.100> you<00:06:59.310> how<00:06:59.550> sensitive<00:06:59.970> it<00:07:00.240> is

00:07:00.320 --> 00:07:00.330 
will show you how sensitive it is

00:07:00.330 --> 00:07:02.750 
will show you how sensitive it is
because<00:07:00.810> then<00:07:01.380> you<00:07:01.680> light<00:07:02.010> up<00:07:02.040> according<00:07:02.700> to

00:07:02.750 --> 00:07:02.760 
because then you light up according to

00:07:02.760 --> 00:07:04.340 
because then you light up according to
how<00:07:02.820> sensitive<00:07:03.210> is<00:07:03.510> if<00:07:03.810> it's<00:07:04.110> really

00:07:04.340 --> 00:07:04.350 
how sensitive is if it's really

00:07:04.350 --> 00:07:06.470 
how sensitive is if it's really
sensitive<00:07:04.710> then<00:07:05.100> all<00:07:05.340> five<00:07:05.910> of<00:07:05.940> these<00:07:06.240> will

00:07:06.470 --> 00:07:06.480 
sensitive then all five of these will

00:07:06.480 --> 00:07:08.300 
sensitive then all five of these will
light<00:07:06.630> up<00:07:06.780> if<00:07:07.020> it's<00:07:07.290> not<00:07:07.500> then<00:07:07.740> only<00:07:07.950> one<00:07:08.130> will

00:07:08.300 --> 00:07:08.310 
light up if it's not then only one will

00:07:08.310 --> 00:07:10.910 
light up if it's not then only one will
light<00:07:08.460> up<00:07:08.610> or<00:07:08.850> none<00:07:09.260> then<00:07:10.260> you<00:07:10.380> want<00:07:10.560> to<00:07:10.620> get<00:07:10.740> a

00:07:10.910 --> 00:07:10.920 
light up or none then you want to get a

00:07:10.920 --> 00:07:13.880 
light up or none then you want to get a
coil<00:07:11.280> and<00:07:11.760> you<00:07:12.540> could<00:07:12.870> get<00:07:13.080> this<00:07:13.290> off<00:07:13.560> of<00:07:13.770> a

00:07:13.880 --> 00:07:13.890 
coil and you could get this off of a

00:07:13.890 --> 00:07:16.760 
coil and you could get this off of a
notebook<00:07:14.210> and<00:07:15.210> find<00:07:15.870> a<00:07:15.960> way<00:07:16.110> to<00:07:16.170> attach<00:07:16.560> it<00:07:16.740> to

00:07:16.760 --> 00:07:16.770
