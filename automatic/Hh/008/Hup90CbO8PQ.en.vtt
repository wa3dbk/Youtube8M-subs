that the price point and what they are

00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:59.630 
that the price point and what they are
asking<00:00:57.600> for<00:00:57.840> him<00:00:58.199> it's<00:00:58.320> still<00:00:58.620> not<00:00:58.890> that<00:00:59.280> right

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
asking for him it's still not that right

time<00:00:59.910> to<00:01:00.149> buy<00:01:00.270> so<00:01:01.140> I've<00:01:01.500> decided<00:01:01.680> to<00:01:01.980> get<00:01:02.129> a

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190 
time to buy so I've decided to get a

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:04.850 
time to buy so I've decided to get a
point<00:01:02.430> in<00:01:02.520> shoot<00:01:03.199> specifically<00:01:04.199> the<00:01:04.530> reason

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:27.810 
want to try out is in low-light
situations<00:04:25.840> they've<00:04:26.620> got<00:04:26.770> a<00:04:26.800> it's<00:04:27.610> called

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:27.820 
situations they've got a it's called

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:31.270 
night portrait or night something which

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:33.810 
night portrait or night something which
basically<00:04:31.990> means<00:04:32.320> when<00:04:32.560> you<00:04:32.620> take<00:04:32.800> a<00:04:32.830> photo<00:04:33.190> it

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:33.820 
basically means when you take a photo it

00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:35.490 
basically means when you take a photo it
takes<00:04:34.030> multiple<00:04:34.210> photos<00:04:34.720> at<00:04:34.990> different<00:04:35.320> ISO

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:35.500 
takes multiple photos at different ISO

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:38.719 
takes multiple photos at different ISO
levels<00:04:35.949> and<00:04:36.940> then<00:04:37.389> it<00:04:37.509> combines<00:04:37.690> it<00:04:38.229> together

00:04:38.719 --> 00:04:38.729 
levels and then it combines it together

00:04:38.729 --> 00:04:41.879 
levels and then it combines it together
so<00:04:39.729> you're<00:04:39.940> going<00:04:40.090> to<00:04:40.120> get<00:04:40.330> one<00:04:40.660> well<00:04:41.320> well-lit
