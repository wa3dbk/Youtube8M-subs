take<00:03:10.480> a<00:03:10.510> look<00:03:10.690> over<00:03:11.020> here<00:03:11.290> this<00:03:11.530> little

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:11.950 
take a look over here this little

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:14.729 
take a look over here this little
disclosure<00:03:12.400> down<00:03:12.910> triangle<00:03:13.540> here<00:03:13.810> there's

00:03:14.729 --> 00:03:14.739 
disclosure down triangle here there's

00:03:14.739 --> 00:03:16.229 
disclosure down triangle here there's
two<00:03:14.950> options<00:03:15.400> in<00:03:15.550> here<00:03:15.640> I<00:03:15.730> want<00:03:15.880> to<00:03:15.970> point<00:03:16.090> out

00:03:16.229 --> 00:03:16.239 
two options in here I want to point out

00:03:16.239 --> 00:03:19.050 
two options in here I want to point out
flatten<00:03:16.840> and<00:03:17.110> flatten<00:03:17.890> and<00:03:17.980> merge<00:03:18.280> flatten

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:19.060 
flatten and flatten and merge flatten

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:23.790 
flatten and flatten and merge flatten
will<00:03:19.810> add<00:03:20.080> in<00:03:20.470> the<00:03:20.709> fades<00:03:21.180> but<00:03:22.180> not<00:03:22.560> merge<00:03:23.560> the

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:23.800 
will add in the fades but not merge the

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:26.670 
will add in the fades but not merge the
two<00:03:23.950> together<00:03:24.070> let<00:03:24.610> me<00:03:24.760> undo<00:03:25.090> that<00:03:25.120> and<00:03:25.680> then

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:26.680 
two together let me undo that and then

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:29.610 
two together let me undo that and then
flatten<00:03:27.550> and<00:03:27.790> merge<00:03:28.090> we'll<00:03:28.450> add<00:03:28.660> the<00:03:28.900> fades<00:03:29.200> as

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:29.620 
flatten and merge we'll add the fades as

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:32.729 
flatten and merge we'll add the fades as
well<00:03:30.310> as<00:03:30.489> merge<00:03:31.239> the<00:03:31.540> two<00:03:31.750> regions<00:03:32.320> together

00:03:32.729 --> 00:03:32.739 
well as merge the two regions together

00:03:32.739 --> 00:03:35.729 
well as merge the two regions together
so<00:03:33.040> now<00:03:33.160> I<00:03:33.190> have<00:03:33.280> a<00:03:33.370> complete<00:03:33.790> take<00:03:34.230> and<00:03:35.230> here's

00:03:35.729 --> 00:03:35.739 
so now I have a complete take and here's

00:03:35.739 --> 00:04:05.010 
so now I have a complete take and here's
what<00:03:35.950> the<00:03:36.130> entire<00:03:36.550> take<00:03:36.850> sounds<00:03:37.209> like

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:05.020 

00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:09.690 

I<00:04:07.290> should<00:04:08.290> mention<00:04:08.440> that<00:04:08.770> you<00:04:08.950> can<00:04:09.310> do<00:04:09.550> this

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:09.700 
I should mention that you can do this

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:12.090 
I should mention that you can do this
with<00:04:09.910> more<00:04:10.150> than<00:04:10.300> just<00:04:10.540> two<00:04:10.780> takes

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:12.100 
with more than just two takes

00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:13.860 
with more than just two takes
I've<00:04:12.370> in<00:04:12.700> many<00:04:12.970> cases<00:04:13.390> I<00:04:13.540> have<00:04:13.660> especially

00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:13.870 
I've in many cases I have especially

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:18.300

composite take of all of the takes

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:26.550 
composite take of all of the takes

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:26.560 
depending on the tuning and the timing

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:28.740
