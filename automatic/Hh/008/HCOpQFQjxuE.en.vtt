around<00:01:04.619> this<00:01:04.949> vehicle<00:01:05.430> you'll<00:01:05.610> notice<00:01:05.939> that

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:06.200 
around this vehicle you'll notice that

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:08.600 
around this vehicle you'll notice that
the<00:01:07.200> individual<00:01:07.650> put<00:01:07.830> this<00:01:07.920> together<00:01:08.130> didn't

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
the individual put this together didn't

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:11.390 
the individual put this together didn't
know<00:01:08.700> how<00:01:08.850> to<00:01:08.909> hook<00:01:09.090> the<00:01:09.240> rear<00:01:09.420> AC<00:01:09.570> up<00:01:09.900> so<00:01:10.400> they

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
know how to hook the rear AC up so they

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:14.330 
know how to hook the rear AC up so they
tied<00:01:12.299> in<00:01:12.479> a<00:01:12.600> rubber<00:01:13.380> hose<00:01:13.590> on<00:01:13.890> the<00:01:13.950> high<00:01:14.100> side

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
tied in a rubber hose on the high side

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:17.200 
tied in a rubber hose on the high side
line<00:01:14.610> with<00:01:14.790> some<00:01:14.909> hose<00:01:15.090> clamps<00:01:15.509> and<00:01:15.630> a<00:01:15.689> bolt

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:17.210 
line with some hose clamps and a bolt

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:19.190 
line with some hose clamps and a bolt
obviously<00:01:18.210> that's<00:01:18.390> not<00:01:18.540> acceptable

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
obviously that's not acceptable

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.289 
obviously that's not acceptable
so<00:01:19.409> naturally<00:01:20.340> the<00:01:20.460> suction<00:01:20.850> line<00:01:21.000> was<00:01:21.180> not

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:21.299 
so naturally the suction line was not

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:25.820 
so naturally the suction line was not
hooked<00:01:21.540> up<00:01:21.689> either<00:01:22.670> that's<00:01:24.290> that<00:01:25.290> kind<00:01:25.560> of

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830 
hooked up either that's that kind of

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:29.539 
hooked up either that's that kind of
workmanship<00:01:26.700> is<00:01:26.880> just<00:01:26.909> unexcusable<00:01:28.460> when<00:01:29.460> we

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:29.549 
workmanship is just unexcusable when we

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:30.830 
workmanship is just unexcusable when we
take<00:01:29.700> a<00:01:29.729> look<00:01:29.939> at<00:01:30.060> the<00:01:30.150> front<00:01:30.420> end<00:01:30.600> of<00:01:30.720> the

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 
take a look at the front end of the

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:33.080 
take a look at the front end of the

vehicle it has no rated no radiator
shroud<00:01:33.329> no<00:01:33.810> fan<00:01:34.170> the<00:01:35.040> reason<00:01:35.400> for<00:01:35.520> that<00:01:35.579> is

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820 
shroud no fan the reason for that is

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:36.980 
shroud no fan the reason for that is
because<00:01:35.970> actually<00:01:36.450> they<00:01:36.689> have<00:01:36.810> the<00:01:36.869> wrong

that<00:02:00.860> the<00:02:01.860> boost<00:02:02.100> pipe<00:02:02.340> was<00:02:02.640> was<00:02:03.509> jammed<00:02:03.930> up

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:04.140 
that the boost pipe was was jammed up

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:06.109 
that the boost pipe was was jammed up
against<00:02:04.680> itself<00:02:04.950> so<00:02:05.219> it<00:02:05.280> was<00:02:05.399> actually<00:02:05.549> kinked

00:02:06.109 --> 00:02:06.119 
against itself so it was actually kinked

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:06.700 
against itself so it was actually kinked
and<00:02:06.180> restrict

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:06.710 
and restrict

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:09.700 
and restrict
portion<00:02:07.430> the<00:02:07.520> airflow<00:02:08.320> butter<00:02:09.320> problem<00:02:09.649> we

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:09.710 
portion the airflow butter problem we

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:13.420 
portion the airflow butter problem we
found<00:02:09.950> is<00:02:10.190> as<00:02:10.540> that<00:02:11.540> we<00:02:12.500> go<00:02:12.680> walking<00:02:13.010> around

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:13.430 
found is as that we go walking around

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:15.490 
found is as that we go walking around
this<00:02:13.610> is<00:02:13.820> the<00:02:13.910> fact<00:02:14.150> that<00:02:14.270> well<00:02:14.570> the<00:02:15.050> radiator

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:15.500 
this is the fact that well the radiator

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:17.440 
this is the fact that well the radiator
is<00:02:15.650> too<00:02:15.890> tall<00:02:16.160> in<00:02:16.400> this<00:02:16.520> application<00:02:17.240> so

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:17.450 
is too tall in this application so

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:19.210 
is too tall in this application so
you'll<00:02:17.840> notice<00:02:18.020> it's<00:02:18.290> actually<00:02:18.440> sitting<00:02:19.070> on

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:19.220 
you'll notice it's actually sitting on

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:21.520 
you'll notice it's actually sitting on
the<00:02:19.730> right<00:02:19.880> front<00:02:20.240> and<00:02:20.690> left<00:02:20.990> front<00:02:21.230> brake

the right front and left front brake

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:24.760 
the right front and left front brake
lines<00:02:22.030> the<00:02:23.030> the<00:02:24.020> brake<00:02:24.230> lines<00:02:24.500> will

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:24.770 
lines the the brake lines will

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:27.760 
lines the the brake lines will
eventually<00:02:25.490> get<00:02:26.330> worn<00:02:26.690> to<00:02:27.320> the<00:02:27.350> point<00:02:27.650> where

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:27.770 
eventually get worn to the point where

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:32.350 
eventually get worn to the point where
they<00:02:27.890> are<00:02:28.390> pierced<00:02:29.390> and<00:02:29.540> will<00:02:30.080> leak<00:02:30.260> a<00:02:31.360> huge

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:32.360 
they are pierced and will leak a huge

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:34.690 
they are pierced and will leak a huge
safety<00:02:32.630> hazard<00:02:33.340> another<00:02:34.340> thing<00:02:34.520> that<00:02:34.640> we

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:34.700 
safety hazard another thing that we

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:36.960 
safety hazard another thing that we
found<00:02:34.730> looking<00:02:35.390> around<00:02:35.510> this<00:02:35.750> vehicle<00:02:36.230> was

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:36.970 
found looking around this vehicle was

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:38.949 
found looking around this vehicle was
was<00:02:37.970> in<00:02:38.090> the<00:02:38.120> fuse<00:02:38.450> box

00:02:38.949 --> 00:02:38.959 
was in the fuse box

00:02:38.959 --> 00:02:42.130 
was in the fuse box
again<00:02:39.800> this<00:02:39.950> is<00:02:40.100> an<00:02:40.220> o1<00:02:40.340> o2<00:02:40.610> fuse<00:02:41.000> box<00:02:41.209> so<00:02:41.300> it's

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:42.140 
again this is an o1 o2 fuse box so it's

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:44.979 
again this is an o1 o2 fuse box so it's
it's<00:02:42.830> not<00:02:43.100> compatible<00:02:43.580> to<00:02:44.060> this<00:02:44.180> engine<00:02:44.630> what

00:02:44.979 --> 00:02:44.989 
it's not compatible to this engine what

00:02:44.989 --> 00:02:46.449 
it's not compatible to this engine what
we're<00:02:45.110> finding<00:02:45.320> when<00:02:45.620> we<00:02:45.709> go<00:02:45.830> through<00:02:46.100> here<00:02:46.340> is
