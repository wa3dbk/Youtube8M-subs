00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:07.190
 thank you very much here we are going then to 

00:00:03.379 --> 00:00:09.259
 see what happened in this in this match in 

00:00:07.190 --> 00:00:11.539
 the complement stage here in the league 

00:00:09.259 --> 00:00:13.849
 who was rehearsing a first foray with 

00:00:11.539 --> 00:00:16.400
 the Miguel Valle that good job of 

00:00:13.849 --> 00:00:19.369
 Miguel would come the corner kick and the 

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:22.100
 there are two men to win 

00:00:19.369 --> 00:00:24.590
 they pressed on the mark 

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:27.380
 midfielder steve sidwell to put 

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:29.900
 the 1 for 0 the impressive jump here 

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:33.739
 with the brand including two players 

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:35.840
 of the percent league those who 

00:00:33.739 --> 00:00:38.240
 they charged 

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:40.130
 I did not understand why Porfirio was not 

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:42.380
 even present in this action here 

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:44.030
 is then 1 by 0 we have this 

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:44.810
 another angle the corner kick that 

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:48.820
 make 

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:52.120
 bryan ruiz good header nothing can be 

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:54.820
 alfonso quesada after this huge 

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:56.980
 shared pass 

00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:59.230
 de garcÃ­a that in which affected 

00:00:56.980 --> 00:01:03.010
 get to the reception party in a 

00:00:59.230 --> 00:01:05.080
 extraordinary way to carry and combine 

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:07.740
 still with greater than throw out of 

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:11.410
 game as observed in this repetition 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:14.950
 for right hook from left and 

00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:17.890
 one side so that the international 

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:20.590
 stekelenburg stay on the road in 

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:22.270
 this very good play by allen guevara 

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:25.240
 that put one by one on the scoreboard 

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:27.430
 the fans were thrilled with this one 

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:30.399
 with this reaction of the league he had 

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:33.640
 your best moments with this action of 

00:01:30.399 --> 00:01:36.729
 this play but the speed of the ball 

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:38.900
 in this in this positioning leaves 

00:01:36.729 --> 00:01:41.060
 margin for what 

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:44.870
 the arbitrator considers that it is the lack of 

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:47.030
 an eagle valley in which they make the 

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:50.320
 good action very important in many 

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:50.320
 stretches of the bryant game 

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:58.540
 criminal says don ricardo 

00:01:54.280 --> 00:02:02.650
 since the execution would come to resign 

00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:06.570
 berbatov something like maybe present maybe 

00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:09.560
 is a bit hard a player 

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:13.920
 and put the 2 for a view controls 

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:16.370
 next shows as annoying the 

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:16.370
 player 

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:23.640
 and it's my turn to say how much was gained slowly 

00:02:20.349 --> 00:02:26.150
 the goalkeeper alfonso quesada 

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:30.930
 little steps 1 2 3 

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:34.500
 and put the two for one sold this action 

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:36.629
 which they will advance and anticipate diaz 

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:38.939
 palma y el bryan ruiz is the one that makes 

00:02:36.629 --> 00:02:41.370
 all the action all the maneuver and hits 

00:02:38.939 --> 00:02:44.069
 very hard nothing to do either for the 

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:48.400
 guardamente national and was three by 

00:02:44.069 --> 00:02:51.370
 one this happened there at minute 87 

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:55.329
 there was not much to keep him in this 

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:58.409
 position as elias loses before the 

00:02:55.329 --> 00:03:02.560
 bryant pressure 

00:02:58.409 --> 00:03:04.959
 I do not think about it and it says around here with all the 

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:07.180
 force that I can hit that ball 

00:03:04.959 --> 00:03:09.440
 by the way that stripe and then two 

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:13.750
 assists one goal 

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:13.750
 that in the game by national
