00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:39.460 
even with the game gear emulation
problems<00:02:36.880> it's<00:02:37.880> boring<00:02:38.569> you<00:02:38.780> can't<00:02:39.110> really

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:39.470 
problems it's boring you can't really

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:42.100 
problems it's boring you can't really

drift<00:02:47.989> to<00:02:48.260> another<00:02:49.420> crappy<00:02:50.420> game<00:02:50.690> on<00:02:50.870> this

00:02:51.009 --> 00:02:51.019 
drift to another crappy game on this

00:02:51.019 --> 00:02:53.199 
drift to another crappy game on this
collection<00:02:51.580> basically<00:02:52.580> you<00:02:52.730> have<00:02:52.940> to<00:02:53.060> turn

00:02:53.199 --> 00:02:53.209 
collection basically you have to turn

00:02:53.209 --> 00:02:57.580 
collection basically you have to turn
like<00:02:54.110> a<00:02:54.319> minute<00:02:54.830> a<00:02:54.950> minute<00:02:55.430> before<00:02:55.790> each<00:02:56.590> turn

00:02:57.580 --> 00:02:57.590 
like a minute a minute before each turn

00:02:57.590 --> 00:03:00.370 
like a minute a minute before each turn
and<00:02:57.950> there's<00:02:58.130> a<00:02:58.190> lot<00:02:58.610> of<00:02:58.670> them<00:02:58.940> so<00:02:59.780> basically

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:00.380 
and there's a lot of them so basically

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:01.740 
and there's a lot of them so basically
you're<00:03:00.530> going<00:03:00.680> to<00:03:00.769> be<00:03:00.860> spending<00:03:01.010> half<00:03:01.459> your

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:07.310 
to stay on the track let alone stay in

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:11.920 
to stay on the track let alone stay in
weed<00:03:08.769> it's<00:03:09.769> actually<00:03:10.580> worse<00:03:11.180> than<00:03:11.209> sonic<00:03:11.750> are

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:11.930 
weed it's actually worse than sonic are

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:14.440 
weed it's actually worse than sonic are
but<00:03:12.500> I'll<00:03:12.620> get<00:03:12.950> to<00:03:12.980> that<00:03:13.160> when<00:03:13.549> it<00:03:13.760> comes<00:03:13.970> up<00:03:14.239> on

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:14.450 
but I'll get to that when it comes up on

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:18.039 
but I'll get to that when it comes up on
the<00:03:14.510> review<00:03:15.700> next<00:03:16.700> is<00:03:17.090> the<00:03:17.330> the<00:03:17.630> game<00:03:17.840> gear

00:03:18.039 --> 00:03:18.049 
the review next is the the game gear

00:03:18.049 --> 00:03:20.080 
the review next is the the game gear
version<00:03:18.349> of<00:03:18.440> Sonic<00:03:18.650> Spinball<00:03:18.950> which<00:03:19.400> actually

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:20.090 
version of Sonic Spinball which actually

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:23.710 
version of Sonic Spinball which actually
I<00:03:20.330> think<00:03:20.450> is<00:03:20.810> also<00:03:21.200> gotten<00:03:21.799> a<00:03:22.130> bad<00:03:22.459> rap<00:03:22.849> I<00:03:23.150> don't

00:03:23.710 --> 00:03:23.720 
I think is also gotten a bad rap I don't

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:27.610 
I think is also gotten a bad rap I don't
know<00:03:23.810> I<00:03:24.280> liked<00:03:25.280> it<00:03:25.459> it's<00:03:25.819> a<00:03:26.360> little<00:03:27.080> bit<00:03:27.200> harder

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:27.620 
know I liked it it's a little bit harder

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:30.490 
know I liked it it's a little bit harder
to<00:03:27.650> control<00:03:27.890> than<00:03:28.280> the<00:03:28.430> Genesis<00:03:28.819> version<00:03:29.500> but

00:03:30.490 --> 00:03:30.500 
to control than the Genesis version but

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:32.949 
to control than the Genesis version but
that's<00:03:30.799> due<00:03:31.340> to<00:03:31.579> being<00:03:31.970> a<00:03:32.090> Game<00:03:32.329> Gear<00:03:32.570> game<00:03:32.780> i

00:03:32.949 --> 00:03:32.959 
that's due to being a Game Gear game i

00:03:32.959 --> 00:03:37.150 
that's due to being a Game Gear game i
guess<00:03:33.100> it's<00:03:34.100> shorter<00:03:34.730> it's<00:03:35.709> not<00:03:36.709> as<00:03:36.890> pretty

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:37.160 
guess it's shorter it's not as pretty

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:39.580 
guess it's shorter it's not as pretty
but<00:03:37.310> hey<00:03:38.150> it's<00:03:38.420> a<00:03:38.540> game<00:03:38.720> gear<00:03:38.959> game<00:03:39.170> what<00:03:39.410> the

00:03:57.400 --> 00:03:57.410 
in my entire life and I've played the

00:03:57.410 --> 00:04:03.550 
in my entire life and I've played the
original<00:03:57.500> Gran<00:03:57.980> Turismo<00:03:58.220> Oh<00:03:59.440> Lord<00:04:02.230> you<00:04:03.230> cannot

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:06.440 
but sometimes it doesn't matter because

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:08.140 
but sometimes it doesn't matter because
you<00:04:06.829> don't<00:04:07.010> even<00:04:07.130> have<00:04:07.310> to<00:04:07.400> stay<00:04:07.639> on<00:04:07.760> the<00:04:07.850> track
