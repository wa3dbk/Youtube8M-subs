00:00:03.980 --> 00:00:11.640
 I bring you a video about what it is 

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:15.540
 this a new way that helps you have 

00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:17.860
 many things like explosions and it's going to be 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:19.780
 this 

00:00:17.860 --> 00:00:23.680
 different types of spoilers that is the 

00:00:19.780 --> 00:00:26.770
 first and the others also help you 

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:29.130
 to do it at night or during the day 

00:00:26.770 --> 00:00:31.380
 survivor or creative 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:32.940
 nothing more good then what we have to 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:36.149
 tell us to go to the bar of 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:40.210
 configurations and we have to give it in 

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:43.690
 admin script that I already have in 

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:45.100
 import from local storage and 

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:47.140
 they look for the folder in which they have 

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:48.670
 you will go out into improving by the 

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:50.920
 they depend on the browser to download it 

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:53.409
 it appears to me as if I did not have 

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:59.699
 no good folder the mod is called 

00:00:53.409 --> 00:00:59.699
 tool point js and they give in 

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:05.409
 and then again 

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:08.109
 the insects 

00:01:05.409 --> 00:01:11.649
 they click on it and they are going to click and 

00:01:08.109 --> 00:01:13.420
 is going to activate is already activated good 

00:01:11.649 --> 00:01:17.079
 then what would be we have to go to 

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:20.399
 minecraft and well we 're going to a 

00:01:17.079 --> 00:01:20.399
 new world in creative 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:25.400
 since they were aquino selena vertex and 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:29.680
 tulle which is the mode 

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:29.680
 but no 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:35.759
 with the charge he had a bit for me 

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:39.869
 screen recorder but good at 15 

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:40.619
 tool berankis the creative survivor the 

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:42.590
 night 

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:45.189
 We will see Berlin 

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:45.189
 or night 

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:56.990
 well we leave that for then I think 

00:01:54.560 --> 00:02:01.540
 it's just a small mistake that happens 

00:01:56.990 --> 00:02:01.540
 to see here is to expose 

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:10.340
 chicken here comes what you can 

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:10.340
 to put for example let's put a 

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:18.870
 let's put but 

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.870
 in this position 

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:22.980
 and we see beyond the fact 

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:27.430
 he has to be a substitute for him 

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:35.010
 well I know it can be opposite but I put 

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:37.939
 we hope to turn on another 

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:37.939
 in you is pauner 

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:42.400
 we are going to expose a chewing gum 

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:45.920
 just as they were 

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:53.810
 and a chicken duck came as I would say in this one 

00:02:54.360 --> 00:03:00.180
 as a direct gameplay and then after 

00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:01.870
 of that we can be increased a half 

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:04.629
 weather 

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:06.730
 it's like the mode that becomes just that 

00:03:04.629 --> 00:03:10.890
 here it's harder to put it because of 

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:10.890
 that you have to put the idea of 

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:14.220
 and the object that you are going to put 

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:19.120
 and after that it would continue 

00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:24.670
 of explosions 

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:26.680
 we will see exploit them 

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:32.000
 let's what to say here 

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:38.830
 of explosion let's put the two 

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:38.830
 and they must use good cars exploited him 

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:44.910
 also after that what we can 

00:03:42.459 --> 00:03:44.910
 do more 

00:03:45.490 --> 00:03:52.190
 we can transport 

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:52.190
 see let's see 

00:03:56.210 --> 00:04:02.590
 let's add the 63 we're going to change 

00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:02.590
 the ascending interest 

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:06.610
 we will see it soon 

00:04:06.950 --> 00:04:11.860
 all that must have export like that 

00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:11.860
 having it I understand 

00:04:13.490 --> 00:04:18.220
 to become a studio manager 

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:30.140
 let's change him in his position 

00:04:26.730 --> 00:04:30.140
 as you will see and we are in survivor 

00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:37.610
 let's change at night we can 

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:37.610
 still that my nights why 

00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:49.690
 we can upload another video about 

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:52.180
 corrected mode and that's why it would be all in 

00:04:49.690 --> 00:04:54.070
 serious that the mod will help you a lot good 

00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:56.830
