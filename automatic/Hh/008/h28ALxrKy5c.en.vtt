00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:50.549 
and i show you like it's so if I did do

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:52.130 
and i show you like it's so if I did do
something<00:01:50.939> it<00:01:51.240> will<00:01:51.299> probably<00:01:51.509> be<00:01:51.659> more<00:01:51.899> just

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
something it will probably be more just

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:54.770 
something it will probably be more just
for<00:01:52.259> storage<00:01:52.710> not<00:01:53.640> really<00:01:54.000> even<00:01:54.240> convenient

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780 
for storage not really even convenient

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:58.219 
for storage not really even convenient
storage<00:01:55.049> I<00:01:56.270> carry<00:01:57.270> my<00:01:57.509> makeup<00:01:57.869> that<00:01:58.020> I'm<00:01:58.140> going

00:01:58.219 --> 00:01:58.229

00:02:02.389 --> 00:02:02.399 
bathroom and back so it's really not

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:03.950 
bathroom and back so it's really not
that<00:02:02.460> convenient<00:02:02.850> that's<00:02:03.149> just<00:02:03.360> how<00:02:03.630> I<00:02:03.659> do<00:02:03.810> the

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:03.960 
that convenient that's just how I do the

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:06.200 
that convenient that's just how I do the
test<00:02:04.140> just<00:02:04.259> how<00:02:04.320> I<00:02:04.380> like<00:02:04.439> it<00:02:04.880> that's<00:02:05.880> just<00:02:06.060> what

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:06.210 
test just how I like it that's just what

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:08.869 
test just how I like it that's just what
I<00:02:06.240> do<00:02:06.329> and<00:02:06.719> yeah<00:02:07.680> so<00:02:07.890> if<00:02:08.099> you<00:02:08.220> just<00:02:08.399> want<00:02:08.550> to<00:02:08.640> see

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:11.910 
how how it's stored like how its

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:14.180 
how how it's stored like how its
organized<00:02:12.480> I<00:02:12.900> could<00:02:13.410> do<00:02:13.500> that

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:14.190 
organized I could do that

00:05:38.659 --> 00:05:38.669 
for some reason so that is my look I
