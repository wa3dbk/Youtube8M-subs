00:00:09.770 --> 00:00:13.730
 unboxing a pair of headphones in the 

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:16.580
 specific rock that the former of the military 

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:19.910

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:21.530
 celtic si of stereo before starting vi 

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:23.960
 I warn you that in this video I will use the 

00:00:21.530 --> 00:00:26.330
 microphone of the rocks that xd military 

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:27.740
 that is the headphones we are boxing though 

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:30.529
 to make you feel the quality of 

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:32.090
 Microphone well then let's see what the 

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:33.560
 makes it so special 

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:35.239
 first of all they have a sound performance of 

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:37.910
 high quality thanks to the speakers from 

00:00:35.239 --> 00:00:39.110
 50 mm have a microphone that 

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:40.370
 allows to eliminate the buzz of 

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:43.040
 background and that can also be 

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:45.440
 removed has optimal comfort 

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:47.420
 thanks to the ultra light design but to the 

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:48.100
 at the same time they are robust and durable in the 

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:50.329
 time 

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:52.010
 You can also control the audio 

00:00:50.329 --> 00:00:53.480
 by means of the remote control, laying on the 

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:55.730
 headphone cable that allows us to 

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:57.200
 turn the microphone on and off 

00:00:55.730 --> 00:01:00.020
 in addition to bringing increase decrease 

00:00:57.200 --> 00:01:01.730
 the audio then we move to the short side 

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:03.289
 of the box on which we find the same 

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:05.030
 features seen before 

00:01:03.289 --> 00:01:07.580
 simply with the images in 

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:09.409
 then we pass to the side 

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:11.420
 back where we find again the 

00:01:09.409 --> 00:01:12.020
 same explanations in English and in various 

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:14.990
 other languages 

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:16.340
 unfortunately, among these there is no Italian 

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:19.130
 let's move on to real boxing e 

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:20.750
 just remove the stick on the part 

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:22.340
 higher 

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:24.460
 we open her trying not to do too many 

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:24.460
 damage 

00:01:29.329 --> 00:01:32.329
 perfect 

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:41.700
 we take out from china packs with the 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:43.530
 attached booklet 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:44.870
 as you can see this is the booklet of 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:49.140
 rocket with the installation guide 

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:52.760
 which we can now put aside but 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:52.760
 we are then at the real headphones 

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:59.210
 we begin to open them we detach everything 

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:09.190
 as you can see they are quite big but 

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:10.840
 they are however very comfortable thanks to 

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:13.510
 more side and upper pillows 

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:14.920
 with which one finds oneself very well 

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:16.300
 moreover the headphones can be 

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:18.970
 regulated according to the economies of 

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:20.709
 then our head goes to the microphone 

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:24.569
 which can be removed that may be 

00:02:20.709 --> 00:02:24.569
 rotated 360 degrees 

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:34.790
 as we have already said his 

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:36.800
 remote controls and integrated with the cable 

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:39.230
 allows you to adjust the audio and manage 

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:40.880
 the microphone we finally have the two 

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:43.010
 jacks that will be attached to our PC 

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:45.860
 the one for the audio is the one for the 

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:48.500
 microphone the cable is long enough me 

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:50.269
 apparently at 2.5 meters then allows him to 

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:52.160
 move without being easy from 

00:02:50.269 --> 00:02:53.780
 good headphones guys 

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:55.940
 this was the headphone unboxing 

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:57.680
 roccat that vx of military 

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:59.150
 I must say that when you try them you notice 

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:01.370
 which are really headphones 

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:03.140
 higher enough to say that listening to them 

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:04.700
 an old video you notice a lot 

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:07.100
 the background noise that with other 

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:08.630
 headphones were also not heard there 

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:09.950
