00:00:15.219 --> 00:00:18.710
 hello to all that it is a pleasure to find you for them this debriefing 

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:24.189
 in order to return to the occasion of course the grand prix of belgium and then 

00:00:24.189 --> 00:00:25.880
 always with - 

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:27.609
 my sides the analysts 

00:00:27.609 --> 00:00:31.499
 he does not hear the hope the player could think it on the radio the armband with 

00:00:31.499 --> 00:00:34.539
 a leap to paris where he is necessarily more good and not in a hotel in 

00:00:34.539 --> 00:00:37.750
 brussels in the past between the beauty of our peoples so a big 

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:41.709
 price 1 who saw the victory of 2008 samy barely sell 

00:00:41.709 --> 00:00:42.980
 mark wahlberg 

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:46.220
 we will almost say without addressing the championship will come after a day 

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.600
 eu 

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:49.620
 already on this grand prize is the boss it was a few minutes 

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:54.110
 yes it is clear that there we can not say otherwise to the extent that I put 

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:57.550
 from the first meters and especially after going to see rodern apparently 

00:00:57.550 --> 00:01:00.229
 he had a small mechanical problem that's what he explained after 

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:03.789
 something important enough that will disrupt in the turn of 

00:01:03.789 --> 00:01:05.960
 training by the way he understood that he had a concern 

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:08.789
 and he said he was eager to settle something is good for them 

00:01:08.789 --> 00:01:11.239
 I'm not going to say he was surprised by the start but hey he lost everything 

00:01:11.239 --> 00:01:14.559
 he was 6th like a nice first corner and that's where we see all the 

00:01:14.559 --> 00:01:16.450
 talent and mastery of weber 

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:18.560
 we come from it as this question state 

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:21.830
 Well, yes, he is the strongman of Parliament despite tire changes 

00:01:21.829 --> 00:01:26.689
 despite the neutralizations celtic accepted he leaves the little mattress that 

00:01:26.689 --> 00:01:29.229
 okay it was not obvious a theme that was rare yesterday a few laps 

00:01:29.229 --> 00:01:30.840
 the finish but limits the damage 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:34.250
 % and congratulations to him thomas this is the tired of the tour best friend thomas it's 

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:35.030
 really from the first round 

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:38.590
 this is the mutant of methods as we like them in contrast to such 

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:41.350
 order not to cash in the reception our friend allende comes out a 

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:42.350
 number one 

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:46.500
 for 100 th which is said is told us the question on our site 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:48.990
 partner in order to not pull as on which of course 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:53.480
 you knew you can drink direct milk dm great prices 

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:56.440
 it's under pressure 

00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:58.350
 how they live at his age 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:01.470
 I will add it is not due also to the fact you say 

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:02.780
 since the beginning of the conflict 

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:07.080
 she is a co-author and has braided enough laurel wreaths 

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:10.080
 from the metal scene to the little German wonder still like 

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:13.450
 she did not call me patrick tambay to tap him a little bit on the 

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:16.800
 head when it's teese debut to say no more it starts with 

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:20.420
 One would end it with drunkenness in the end there ctr who took the feet 

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:24.340
 in the emc carpet shows that there he struggles to resist the pressure 

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:28.060
 especially ran to him so go signed the apo the details only go away the 

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:30.239
 fourth time so on the second line 

00:02:30.239 --> 00:02:33.079
 on the contrary, it was necessary to do exactly what did and where repentants 

00:02:33.079 --> 00:02:33.980
 find 6th 

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:37.840
 do not make any mistake in a great price the price where anything could happen and 

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:39.599
 italy did it back then already 

00:02:39.599 --> 00:02:43.230
 the first of the mistakes we're going to the city 16th tower of memory when actually 

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:46.969
 it is fighting so with that with the stick that is who is right in front 

00:02:46.969 --> 00:02:47.560
 him 

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:49.280
 unfortunately we understood 

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:52.720
 he gets very fast so the last turns a floor but this 

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:53.169
 rare 

00:02:53.169 --> 00:02:56.749
 it arrives on bottone it starts raining at that place so the 

00:02:56.749 --> 00:03:00.569
 boxes obviously have these stables his position fresnes inside 

00:03:00.569 --> 00:03:03.950
 viettel comes back on him very very strong and the image is that it must to the last 

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:07.019
 moment that it is time that deviated to continue to brake and the 

00:03:07.019 --> 00:03:10.629
 city ​​a rather rare way in formulating from the outside so the stop 

00:03:10.629 --> 00:03:12.990
 of balls that cairns them and comes crashing down from autumn 

00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:16.459
 on the left flank crushing the radiator it's over for autumn 

00:03:16.459 --> 00:03:18.900
 and here we can say that he had a good result the earth 

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:21.189
 she second third or will accept 

00:03:21.189 --> 00:03:23.390
 and d'estelle change his muzzle 

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:26.150
 so then there is what we did not know claudio I do not know who 

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:30.149
 he is again penalized meal 325 pit stop for metal 

00:03:30.149 --> 00:03:34.739
 who finished 15th for that I think it will not fix without his mentality 

00:03:34.739 --> 00:03:36.489
 from there it's true he did 

00:03:36.489 --> 00:03:39.519
 all the nonsense why I say it with a more polluted aspect of the world 

00:03:39.519 --> 00:03:43.749
 we have a great price and my faith even if the side of the ball we will talk about 

00:03:43.749 --> 00:03:47.599
 champion of the tarn we want nothing decided but where and glass clear he has 

00:03:47.599 --> 00:03:50.579
 spoke always about luc ferry 

00:03:50.579 --> 00:03:54.969
 judged on fanatic f1 even if the sanctions were they not 

00:03:54.969 --> 00:03:57.299
 too severe 

00:03:57.299 --> 00:04:00.609
 there too we can always question those how do with arbitration 

00:04:00.609 --> 00:04:02.299
 should it not be necessary 

00:04:02.299 --> 00:04:05.559
 well no because already a good there the maneuvering good it's part of the 

00:04:05.559 --> 00:04:08.859
 run to volunteer sepang at all and this money makes a huge a huge 

00:04:08.859 --> 00:04:10.860
 a horizon that deprives bottone and puts it 

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:13.339
 out of the box in any case for the moment so past 

00:04:13.339 --> 00:04:16.819
 after what happened compared to other countries of memory we did not 

00:04:16.819 --> 00:04:20.180
 seen the detail the yes it's true that a friction good that it's been five years 

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:23.430
 let's say i will have paid the head addition for all of his 

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:26.860
 behavior a little aggressive here in my opinion we're going for now 

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:29.830
 you make the total think about doing that to go through the stands and we 

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:30.629
 speak more here 

00:04:30.629 --> 00:04:33.770
 only one add that it's not the first time it's going through 

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:36.759
 stands digitized by the first time human acura can estimate that we have 

00:04:36.759 --> 00:04:39.860
 still a little guarded by the police who always aim to get out 

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:43.069
 his little bit I do not believe me I I honestly do not believe I believe that 

00:04:43.069 --> 00:04:44.099
 it is rough 

00:04:44.099 --> 00:04:46.820
 it is clear but it is not not worthy of a bad spirit 

00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:49.880
 % you see what I mean here the difference to the notables and especially 

00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:51.310
 compared to his peers 

00:04:51.310 --> 00:04:54.960
 I live by not going to hear not criticize hard said bored a little 

00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:55.680
 limit 

00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:57.039
 so it's not limited 

00:04:57.039 --> 00:04:57.910
 simply ii 

00:04:57.910 --> 00:05:00.890
 he gives everything he has had even a little bit beyond that sometimes it does not happen 

00:05:00.890 --> 00:05:01.259
 not 

00:05:01.259 --> 00:05:03.909
 and when he wants he goes beyond what's called the terminals a word he had 

00:05:03.909 --> 00:05:05.400
 brutally than those that were so 

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:07.920
 who sat at the head of racing action this time 

00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:10.930
 oh my faith which I do not believe they are persecuted or particularly 

00:05:10.930 --> 00:05:14.060
 monitored I think he does I mean a lot of bullshit and so they 

00:05:14.060 --> 00:05:17.270
 pay the new addition for us the problem is where the ircam have 

00:05:17.270 --> 00:05:21.110
 rated the bankers at the bar she was in the middle of the handmade 

00:05:21.110 --> 00:05:24.460
 according to bp told afp by phone so we will stay a little 

00:05:24.460 --> 00:05:25.259
 not sure yet 

00:05:25.259 --> 00:05:28.409
 about this problem and that a question of books 74 

00:05:28.409 --> 00:05:30.199
 that's what evenings 

00:05:30.199 --> 00:05:33.199
 car security was it all well founded 

00:05:33.199 --> 00:05:35.789
 it is true that I too asked myself a little the question then 

00:05:35.789 --> 00:05:38.569
 evacuated immediately those of the ferrari obviously from 

00:05:38.569 --> 00:05:41.639
 the balloon through life are revulsed past hot elsewhere to 

00:05:41.639 --> 00:05:43.580
 to fade the really stuck cat 

00:05:43.580 --> 00:05:46.560
 for that it was better I think that it was necessary to leave this ferrari which 

00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:49.449
 will wait for the commissioners it is for when even when we leave the celtic 

00:05:49.449 --> 00:05:52.740
 arrow always reminds us that we protect the commissioners first and by 

00:05:52.740 --> 00:05:55.129
 pilots children in a reduced way the pilots but 

00:05:55.129 --> 00:05:57.700
 especially the commissioners must still see who come on the track 

00:05:57.700 --> 00:06:00.600
 in the middle of machines that can tumble 300 km to fill the 

00:06:00.600 --> 00:06:04.240
 quarters with average visibility so that we evacuate after for the history of the 

00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:06.520
 debris we can discuss but 

00:06:06.520 --> 00:06:10.210
 I say that now the practice of cesti because in formula 

00:06:10.210 --> 00:06:13.560
 it has imposed itself naturally as in the United States we do not pose the 

00:06:13.560 --> 00:06:14.590
 question in the usa 

00:06:14.590 --> 00:06:16.280
 so I'm not going to be careful 

00:06:16.280 --> 00:06:19.430
 we restart the race leaving sebti because to regroup everyone 

00:06:19.430 --> 00:06:21.449
 but let's say that there was a resourceful 

00:06:21.449 --> 00:06:24.330
 to evacuate the summer in the middle of the track with a commissioner niagne 

00:06:24.330 --> 00:06:27.110
 what would your tone be there once is the race direction does not protect 

00:06:27.110 --> 00:06:27.990
 committed these stories 

00:06:27.990 --> 00:06:31.150
 unfortunately the commissioner hurt he himself got it worse in the 

00:06:31.150 --> 00:06:34.669
 passed me so I do not question his good is that it is necessary 

00:06:34.669 --> 00:06:38.060
 also know that the race director at edward act very quickly so he 

00:06:38.060 --> 00:06:41.419
 a few seconds to decide the situation my faith we choose 

00:06:41.419 --> 00:06:44.960
 the security option it does not shock me and then all the better if it restarts the 

00:06:44.960 --> 00:06:45.789
 race and that 

00:06:45.789 --> 00:06:48.580
 sahani iran annie is a little bit bros 

00:06:48.580 --> 00:06:49.669
 what his complaint 

00:06:49.669 --> 00:06:52.900
 annie let some forms of pc strategy and like every time 

00:06:52.900 --> 00:06:55.080
 it was when cooking miller and brandon that it is true it is 

00:06:55.080 --> 00:06:56.259
 would have liked to see 

00:06:56.259 --> 00:06:57.680
 who stayed 

00:06:57.680 --> 00:07:00.449
 yes who was waiting and who was not waiting for someone who came into the stands 

00:07:00.449 --> 00:07:03.380
 who did not miss a good it's true that a fact that the car safety 

00:07:03.380 --> 00:07:06.419
 kind of atmosphere we find a small quiz calculations behind 

00:07:06.419 --> 00:07:08.010
 the ad left during that time group 

00:07:08.010 --> 00:07:11.229
 good it's a little bit that in five questions 

00:07:11.229 --> 00:07:13.480
 lüthi reber that we could take place 

00:07:13.480 --> 00:07:16.550
 they will try long and hard they had to wait before turning 

00:07:16.550 --> 00:07:20.760
 a plane pilot in the united states that pau in total is ended up balancing 

00:07:20.760 --> 00:07:23.789
 hope that over more season do not have to reason about a grand prize 

00:07:23.789 --> 00:07:27.729
 on a season a couple advantaged a couple penalize a shot it's nothing 

00:07:27.729 --> 00:07:30.599
 well here it is clear that strategy to are upset but 

00:07:30.599 --> 00:07:32.830
 teams must now integrated 

00:07:32.830 --> 00:07:36.300
 the presence in these small print moment in a formula race 

00:07:36.300 --> 00:07:37.830
 let alone not pass 

00:07:37.830 --> 00:07:41.249
 a fortiori when the weather conditions are also his ham and so on 

00:07:41.249 --> 00:07:44.949
 me and I I play not me not shocking just ate it again 

00:07:44.949 --> 00:07:47.900
 we play the security card in relation to the commissioners 

00:07:47.900 --> 00:07:49.340
 and the drivers of course it seems normal
