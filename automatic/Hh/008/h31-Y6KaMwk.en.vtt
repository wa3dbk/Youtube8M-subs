00:03:57.700 --> 00:03:57.710 
system um and it's it's new you know

00:03:57.710 --> 00:03:59.230 
system um and it's it's new you know
that's<00:03:57.920> what<00:03:58.130> I<00:03:58.190> have<00:03:58.340> to<00:03:58.370> say<00:03:58.550> about<00:03:58.640> I<00:03:58.760> have

00:03:59.230 --> 00:03:59.240 
that's what I have to say about I have

00:03:59.240 --> 00:04:02.920

no<00:03:59.450> problem<00:03:59.660> with<00:03:59.840> Metro<00:04:00.260> UI<00:04:00.470> um<00:04:01.130> I<00:04:02.000> think<00:04:02.840> that

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:02.930 
no problem with Metro UI um I think that

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:06.310 
no problem with Metro UI um I think that
they<00:04:03.050> should<00:04:03.080> just<00:04:03.380> have<00:04:03.500> an<00:04:03.650> option<00:04:03.890> to<00:04:04.400> uh<00:04:05.320> to

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:06.320 
they should just have an option to uh to

00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:08.050 
they should just have an option to uh to
disable<00:04:06.770> it<00:04:06.860> I<00:04:07.010> don't<00:04:07.190> see<00:04:07.400> what's<00:04:07.700> so<00:04:07.790> hard

00:04:08.050 --> 00:04:08.060 
disable it I don't see what's so hard

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:09.310 
disable it I don't see what's so hard
about<00:04:08.120> that<00:04:08.270> just<00:04:08.570> have<00:04:08.750> a<00:04:08.780> little<00:04:08.990> toggle

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:09.320 
about that just have a little toggle
