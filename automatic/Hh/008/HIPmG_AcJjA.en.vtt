match the paint with the death of powder

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:18.820 
match the paint with the death of powder
and<00:02:15.019> also<00:02:16.019> how<00:02:16.530> this<00:02:17.459> rain<00:02:17.700> is<00:02:17.849> going<00:02:18.090> to<00:02:18.269> blend

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:18.830 
and also how this rain is going to blend

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:24.729 
and also how this rain is going to blend
well<00:02:19.830> with<00:02:20.099> the<00:02:20.940> applied<00:02:21.269> data<00:02:21.590> and<00:02:22.590> it's<00:02:23.040> a

00:02:24.729 --> 00:02:24.739 
well with the applied data and it's a

00:02:24.739 --> 00:02:27.080 
well with the applied data and it's a
lot<00:02:25.739> of<00:02:25.769> things<00:02:26.010> will<00:02:26.280> go<00:02:26.459> wrong<00:02:26.700> at<00:02:26.940> this

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:27.090 
lot of things will go wrong at this

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:30.140 
lot of things will go wrong at this
stage<00:02:27.390> so<00:02:27.840> it's<00:02:28.230> it's<00:02:28.610> quite<00:02:29.610> important<00:02:30.120> to

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:30.150 
stage so it's it's quite important to

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:33.140 
stage so it's it's quite important to
too<00:02:30.810> much<00:02:31.049> the<00:02:31.260> Colorado<00:02:31.709> as<00:02:32.069> actively<00:02:32.670> as<00:02:32.849> you

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:33.150 
too much the Colorado as actively as you

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:45.540 
too much the Colorado as actively as you
can<00:02:33.420> before<00:02:34.069> start<00:02:35.069> painting<00:02:35.540> the<00:02:36.540> figures

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:45.550 

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:49.780 

similarly<00:02:46.550> I<00:02:47.510> applied<00:02:48.470> there<00:02:48.770> the<00:02:49.430> darker

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:49.790 
similarly I applied there the darker

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:53.650 
similarly I applied there the darker
colors<00:02:50.210> in<00:02:50.480> this<00:02:50.660> instance<00:02:51.530> the<00:02:52.400> black<00:02:52.640> one<00:02:52.820> so

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:53.660 
colors in this instance the black one so

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:56.830 
colors in this instance the black one so
at<00:02:54.170> the<00:02:54.320> box<00:02:54.530> of<00:02:54.740> shoes<00:02:55.310> back<00:02:55.760> to<00:02:55.970> the<00:02:56.510> back<00:02:56.690> of

at the box of shoes back to the back of

00:02:56.840 --> 00:03:04.590 
at the box of shoes back to the back of
the<00:02:57.970> socks<00:02:59.290> the<00:03:00.290> shorts<00:03:00.850> all<00:03:01.850> the<00:03:02.090> other<00:03:02.240> areas

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:04.600 
the socks the shorts all the other areas

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:07.000 
the socks the shorts all the other areas
they<00:03:05.600> have<00:03:05.690> to<00:03:05.810> be<00:03:05.959> a<00:03:06.260> little<00:03:06.709> bit<00:03:06.800> careful

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:07.010 
they have to be a little bit careful

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:11.470 
they have to be a little bit careful
here<00:03:07.280> because<00:03:09.400> you<00:03:10.400> know<00:03:10.520> black<00:03:10.850> is<00:03:10.880> not<00:03:11.180> very

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:11.480 
here because you know black is not very

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:13.930 
here because you know black is not very
easily<00:03:11.660> removable<00:03:12.500> if<00:03:12.890> you<00:03:13.010> do<00:03:13.160> it<00:03:13.250> mistake

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:13.940 
easily removable if you do it mistake

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:17.440 
easily removable if you do it mistake
so<00:03:14.150> it's<00:03:15.080> it's<00:03:15.800> good<00:03:16.100> if<00:03:16.220> you<00:03:16.430> have<00:03:16.730> a<00:03:16.760> couple

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:17.450 
so it's it's good if you have a couple

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:20.770 
so it's it's good if you have a couple
of<00:03:17.510> good<00:03:17.690> quality<00:03:18.200> brushes<00:03:19.180> three<00:03:20.180> zero<00:03:20.540> four
