since installing the new engine so this

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:41.930 
since installing the new engine so this
is<00:00:39.120> the<00:00:39.210> very<00:00:39.390> first<00:00:39.629> run<00:00:40.550> you<00:00:41.550> can<00:00:41.670> see<00:00:41.820> the

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:41.940 
is the very first run you can see the

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:46.180 
is the very first run you can see the
car<00:00:42.120> moving<00:00:42.420> when<00:00:42.660> I<00:00:42.690> do<00:00:43.230> the<00:00:43.379> throttle<00:00:44.930> and

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:46.190 
car moving when I do the throttle and

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:49.880 
car moving when I do the throttle and
see<00:00:47.190> if<00:00:47.250> we<00:00:47.340> got<00:00:47.460> steering<00:00:48.000> here<00:00:48.649> we<00:00:49.649> can<00:00:49.770> get

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
see if we got steering here we can get

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:54.200 
see if we got steering here we can get
them<00:00:49.980> both<00:00:50.100> in<00:00:50.280> the<00:00:50.370> shot

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:56.760 

so<00:00:55.210> we<00:00:55.300> got<00:00:55.420> throttle<00:00:55.720> and<00:00:55.810> rudder<00:00:56.020> going<00:00:56.620> to

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:56.770 
so we got throttle and rudder going to

00:00:56.770 --> 00:00:58.770 
so we got throttle and rudder going to
channel<00:00:56.980> so<00:00:57.280> that's<00:00:57.400> fine<00:00:57.700> let's<00:00:58.600> give<00:00:58.750> it

00:00:58.770 --> 00:00:58.780 
channel so that's fine let's give it

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:08.700 
channel so that's fine let's give it
some<00:00:58.870> throttle<00:00:59.110> trim<00:01:00.360> and<00:01:01.360> let's<00:01:01.810> prime<00:01:02.200> it

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:08.710 

00:01:08.710 --> 00:02:25.180 

I<00:01:10.890> don't<00:01:11.890> have<00:01:12.010> to<00:01:12.130> use

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:25.190 

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:28.370
