00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:25.530 
a lot of little nits but if I sanded it
and<00:03:23.860> use<00:03:24.310> steel<00:03:24.580> wool<00:03:24.820> it<00:03:25.000> would<00:03:25.120> really<00:03:25.300> bring

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:25.540 
and use steel wool it would really bring

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:27.120 
and use steel wool it would really bring
up<00:03:25.780> the<00:03:25.900> sheen<00:03:26.140> it<00:03:26.260> would<00:03:26.350> become<00:03:26.560> quite<00:03:26.800> shiny

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:27.130 
up the sheen it would become quite shiny

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:29.400 
up the sheen it would become quite shiny
sometimes<00:03:27.730> that's<00:03:28.000> desirable<00:03:28.390> I<00:03:28.840> want<00:03:29.350> to

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:29.410 
sometimes that's desirable I want to

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:30.900 
sometimes that's desirable I want to
keep<00:03:29.590> the<00:03:29.740> same<00:03:29.950> sheen<00:03:30.250> I<00:03:30.280> want<00:03:30.520> to<00:03:30.580> get<00:03:30.700> rid<00:03:30.850> of

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:30.910 
keep the same sheen I want to get rid of

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:33.270 
keep the same sheen I want to get rid of
the<00:03:31.030> Nets<00:03:31.470> I've<00:03:32.470> got<00:03:32.710> a<00:03:32.740> single<00:03:33.040> edge<00:03:33.250> razor

00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:33.280 
the Nets I've got a single edge razor

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:36.180 
the Nets I've got a single edge razor
blade<00:03:33.910> here<00:03:34.240> in<00:03:34.450> a<00:03:34.540> holder<00:03:34.960> and<00:03:35.770> I'm<00:03:35.950> going<00:03:36.160> to

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:36.190 
blade here in a holder and I'm going to

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:40.170 
blade here in a holder and I'm going to
take<00:03:36.430> this<00:03:36.610> blade<00:03:36.940> and<00:03:37.180> very<00:03:37.540> carefully<00:03:39.180> run

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:40.180 
take this blade and very carefully run

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:42.330 
take this blade and very carefully run
along<00:03:40.450> the<00:03:40.600> top<00:03:40.840> here<00:03:40.870> and<00:03:41.320> I'm<00:03:42.130> actually

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:42.340 
along the top here and I'm actually

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:47.130 
along the top here and I'm actually
cutting<00:03:42.760> off<00:03:43.500> all<00:03:44.500> the<00:03:44.770> little<00:03:44.890> dust<00:03:45.450> and<00:03:46.450> then

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:47.140 
cutting off all the little dust and then

00:03:47.140 --> 00:04:14.500 
cutting off all the little dust and then
this<00:03:49.320> feels<00:03:50.320> real<00:03:50.530> smooth

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:14.510 

00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:18.260 

so<00:04:15.510> here<00:04:15.750> we<00:04:15.840> go<00:04:16.020> this<00:04:16.230> really<00:04:16.410> nice<00:04:17.270> cherry

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:18.270 
so here we go this really nice cherry

00:04:18.270 --> 00:04:19.940 
so here we go this really nice cherry
drop<00:04:18.600> leaf<00:04:18.810> table<00:04:19.080> it's<00:04:19.380> probably<00:04:19.680> from<00:04:19.830> the

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:19.950 
drop leaf table it's probably from the

00:04:19.950 --> 00:04:23.630 
drop leaf table it's probably from the
first<00:04:20.160> half<00:04:20.459> of<00:04:20.670> the<00:04:20.850> the<00:04:21.660> 19th<00:04:22.170> century<00:04:22.640> by

first half of the the 19th century by

00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:26.210 
first half of the the 19th century by
the<00:04:23.670> way<00:04:23.910> the<00:04:24.090> boards<00:04:24.540> the<00:04:24.960> top<00:04:25.200> and<00:04:25.500> each<00:04:26.040> of

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:26.220 
the way the boards the top and each of

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:27.890 
the way the boards the top and each of
the<00:04:26.310> leaves<00:04:26.550> are<00:04:26.820> made<00:04:26.970> out<00:04:27.120> of<00:04:27.150> single<00:04:27.450> pieces

00:04:27.890 --> 00:04:27.900 
the leaves are made out of single pieces

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:30.230 
the leaves are made out of single pieces
of<00:04:28.020> cherry<00:04:28.320> and<00:04:28.620> all<00:04:29.400> they<00:04:29.520> do<00:04:29.640> is<00:04:29.760> refinish

00:04:30.230 --> 00:04:30.240 
of cherry and all they do is refinish

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:34.130 
of cherry and all they do is refinish
the<00:04:30.390> top<00:04:30.630> and<00:04:31.140> my<00:04:31.290> goal<00:04:31.500> was<00:04:31.530> to<00:04:32.840> sand<00:04:33.840> it<00:04:34.020> as

00:04:34.130 --> 00:04:34.140 
the top and my goal was to sand it as

00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:36.640 
the top and my goal was to sand it as
little<00:04:34.350> as<00:04:34.440> possible<00:04:34.560> get<00:04:35.460> the<00:04:35.580> rings<00:04:35.820> out<00:04:36.060> and

00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:36.650 
little as possible get the rings out and

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:40.040 
little as possible get the rings out and
give<00:04:37.650> it<00:04:37.740> a<00:04:37.770> nice<00:04:37.920> tung<00:04:38.190> oil<00:04:38.310> finish<00:04:38.490> I<00:04:39.050> think

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:40.050 
give it a nice tung oil finish I think

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:55.940 
give it a nice tung oil finish I think
it<00:04:40.110> looks<00:04:40.260> pretty<00:04:40.470> good

00:04:55.940 --> 00:04:55.950 

00:04:55.950 --> 00:04:58.010
