00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
like we've been talking about the whole

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:58.400 
like we've been talking about the whole
game<00:00:55.699> it's<00:00:56.699> just<00:00:57.030> gearboxes<00:00:57.899> clever<00:00:58.140> way<00:00:58.379> of

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:58.410 
game it's just gearboxes clever way of

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:02.840 
game it's just gearboxes clever way of
using<00:00:58.739> things<00:00:59.730> already<00:01:00.059> in<00:01:00.210> the<00:01:00.329> game<00:01:01.760> put<00:01:02.760> the

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
using things already in the game put the

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:04.250 
using things already in the game put the
green<00:01:03.030> highlight<00:01:03.449> on<00:01:03.660> it<00:01:03.809> and<00:01:03.960> make<00:01:03.989> it<00:01:04.110> a

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260 
green highlight on it and make it a

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:11.350 
green highlight on it and make it a
mission<00:01:04.589> so<00:01:05.210> that's<00:01:06.210> what<00:01:06.390> this<00:01:06.510> is<00:01:10.159> getting

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:11.360 
mission so that's what this is getting

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:13.580 
mission so that's what this is getting
solo<00:01:12.360> deeper<00:01:12.630> surely<00:01:12.900> getting<00:01:13.049> closer<00:01:13.290> to<00:01:13.439> the

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
solo deeper surely getting closer to the

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:15.620 
solo deeper surely getting closer to the
end<00:01:13.710> of<00:01:13.890> the<00:01:13.950> game<00:01:14.180> that's<00:01:15.180> where<00:01:15.390> the<00:01:15.450> game<00:01:15.570> is
