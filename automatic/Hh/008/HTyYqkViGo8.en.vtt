00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:09.400
 and 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:13.650
 and this was the game that was played in the 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:16.800
 Coliseum of the San Antonio neighborhood in Tunja 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:18.210
 between sunpass and condors by live la 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:20.310
 first entry arrived at 2 minutes 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:23.250
 and it was through julián sanchez 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:24.599
 who received the pass from André Sierra 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:26.400
 Of course this also got it from 

00:00:24.599 --> 00:00:28.800
 jefferson zetina seconds later 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:32.309
 individual play and jefferson zetina 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:35.460
 place in this way the 0 by 2 were going 

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:38.670
 quickly up to the capital and 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:41.280
 a sports sanpas go dead was 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:43.080
 Andrew entered asleep they saw 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:45.750
 it was placed steven april alejandro 

00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:48.780
 vargas and finally on the bar and the 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:50.570
 king hill places 0 for 3 at 10 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:53.690
 minutes 

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:56.150
 I finish very well being under the 

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:57.770
 portico and alejandro sua joined once 

00:00:56.150 --> 00:01:00.559
 more with jefferson zetina that you can 

00:00:57.770 --> 00:01:02.629
 doublet and placed the zero by four of 

00:01:00.559 --> 00:01:05.119
 half distance first time zero by 

00:01:02.629 --> 00:01:08.420
 four and in the second half we will see 

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:11.119
 five more times the team reacted 

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:13.460
 local and with jairo velandia placed the 

00:01:11.119 --> 00:01:15.920
 first so much of your team the one by 

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:19.040
 four after that ball play 

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:21.979
 stop the number 15 defined and then it was 

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:23.960
 the own goal by camilo sanchez who wanted 

00:01:21.979 --> 00:01:26.000
 enable césar matheus but sánchez was 

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:28.340
 who put it later Julian 

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:31.130
 martínez placed a bit more were in 

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:32.750
 kickback three against one including 

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:34.490
 the goalkeeper would be three against two and of 

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:36.289
 Thus came the three four 

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:37.970
 they thought a draw but in this 

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:40.039
 counterattack 

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:42.050
 Julian Sanchez placed the 3 by 5 and 

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:45.560
 was already sealing the victory that was 

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:47.630
 about minute 38 but seconds more 

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:50.960
 Later Julian Martinez would have one more 

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:53.119
 to place the four by five choruses 

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:55.909
 of the second penal point and in this way 

00:01:53.119 --> 00:01:59.320
 I was going to finish the engagement so easy 

00:01:55.909 --> 00:01:59.320
 of 45 with 3 

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:14.099
 but so unfortunately we are not 

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:16.530
 making the goals we are not 

00:02:14.099 --> 00:02:19.230
 specifying and I do not know what is happening to us 

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:20.879
 a very bad streak is not touched to lift 

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:23.700
 head to continue adding the first the 

00:02:20.879 --> 00:02:25.549
 first three points yes I think it was a 

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:27.900
 very important victory something suffered 

00:02:25.549 --> 00:02:29.879
 we thought that we had taken it forward 

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:31.409
 in the first time but then they 

00:02:29.879 --> 00:02:33.120
 they did a great job in the second and 

00:02:31.409 --> 00:02:34.920
 counteract everything we had done 

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:37.400
 and I think that if we got the 

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:37.400
 goals against
