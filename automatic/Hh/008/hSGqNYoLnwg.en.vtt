hybrid picking let's see jump big

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:51.980 
hybrid picking let's see jump big
intervals<00:00:48.930> and<00:00:49.260> it's<00:00:49.770> commonly<00:00:50.250> used<00:00:50.640> by<00:00:51.360> Pat

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:51.990 
intervals and it's commonly used by Pat

00:00:51.990 --> 00:00:56.030 
intervals and it's commonly used by Pat
Metheny<00:00:52.220> he<00:00:53.220> does<00:00:53.460> this<00:00:53.780> in<00:00:54.780> his<00:00:55.080> solo<00:00:55.710> Inga

basically<00:01:11.400> this<00:01:11.700> lick<00:01:12.000> takes<00:01:12.360> the<00:01:12.660> g<00:01:12.810> string

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 
basically this lick takes the g string

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:15.020 
basically this lick takes the g string
and<00:01:13.170> the<00:01:13.380> E<00:01:13.530> string<00:01:13.830> and<00:01:13.979> they<00:01:14.220> work<00:01:14.400> together

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
and the E string and they work together

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:17.960 
and the E string and they work together
to<00:01:15.570> make<00:01:15.900> this<00:01:16.080> intervallic<00:01:16.650> jump<00:01:17.070> you<00:01:17.729> do<00:01:17.940> a

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970 
to make this intervallic jump you do a

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:22.100 
to make this intervallic jump you do a
pull<00:01:18.600> off<00:01:18.810> then<00:01:19.640> pick<00:01:20.640> and<00:01:20.910> then<00:01:21.450> use<00:01:21.869> your

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
pull off then pick and then use your

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:25.430 
pull off then pick and then use your
middle<00:01:22.290> finger<00:01:22.830> to<00:01:23.210> hybrid<00:01:24.210> pluck<00:01:24.660> the<00:01:25.259> high<00:01:25.410> E

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:25.440 
middle finger to hybrid pluck the high E

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:28.310 
middle finger to hybrid pluck the high E
string<00:01:25.590> so<00:01:25.920> you<00:01:26.160> pick<00:01:26.490> on<00:01:26.640> the<00:01:26.700> g<00:01:27.000> string<00:01:27.320> then

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
string so you pick on the g string then

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:31.730 
string so you pick on the g string then
pull<00:01:28.710> off<00:01:28.920> then<00:01:29.840> pick<00:01:30.840> again<00:01:31.170> on<00:01:31.350> the<00:01:31.530> fifth

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
pull off then pick again on the fifth

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:36.710 
pull off then pick again on the fifth
fret<00:01:31.979> so<00:01:34.220> and<00:01:35.220> then<00:01:35.910> you<00:01:36.090> use<00:01:36.300> your<00:01:36.330> middle

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:39.590 
down so here it is notated and I'll play
it<00:03:20.350> slowly<00:03:20.500> while<00:03:21.220> you<00:03:21.460> look<00:03:22.270> at<00:03:22.390> the<00:03:22.480> notation

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:39.600 

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:42.510 

so<00:03:40.600> one<00:03:40.930> way<00:03:41.050> you<00:03:41.080> can<00:03:41.320> mix<00:03:41.500> this<00:03:41.680> up<00:03:41.740> and<00:03:42.100> put

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:42.520 
so one way you can mix this up and put

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:43.650 
so one way you can mix this up and put
it<00:03:42.580> in<00:03:42.610> your<00:03:42.730> own<00:03:42.850> playing<00:03:43.090> is<00:03:43.270> by<00:03:43.420> using

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:43.660 
it in your own playing is by using

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:45.420 
it in your own playing is by using
different<00:03:43.930> string<00:03:44.380> sets<00:03:44.650> so<00:03:44.860> let's<00:03:45.070> have<00:03:45.370> the

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:45.430 
different string sets so let's have the

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:52.250 
different string sets so let's have the
D<00:03:45.730> string<00:03:46.030> going<00:03:46.720> up<00:03:47.170> to<00:03:47.530> high<00:03:47.710> E<00:03:47.770> this<00:03:48.130> time

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:52.260 

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:53.940 

let's<00:03:53.260> try<00:03:53.440> that<00:03:53.590> again

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:53.950 
let's try that again

00:03:53.950 --> 00:04:04.760 
let's try that again
but<00:03:54.310> less

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:04.770 

00:04:04.770 --> 00:04:08.660 

and<00:04:05.550> you<00:04:05.940> don't<00:04:06.090> have<00:04:06.240> to<00:04:06.480> just<00:04:06.780> go<00:04:07.080> up<00:04:07.260> 2/3<00:04:08.250> or

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:08.670 
and you don't have to just go up 2/3 or

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:10.940 
and you don't have to just go up 2/3 or
6<00:04:09.030> like<00:04:09.480> we've<00:04:09.660> been<00:04:09.900> doing<00:04:10.170> you<00:04:10.320> can<00:04:10.530> go<00:04:10.650> up<00:04:10.770> to

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:10.950 
6 like we've been doing you can go up to

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:12.530 
6 like we've been doing you can go up to
any<00:04:11.100> intervals<00:04:11.610> so<00:04:11.820> in<00:04:11.940> this<00:04:12.030> case<00:04:12.240> I'm<00:04:12.390> gonna

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:12.540 
any intervals so in this case I'm gonna

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:16.990 
any intervals so in this case I'm gonna
go<00:04:12.630> G<00:04:13.200> f-sharp<00:04:13.470> G<00:04:13.980> up<00:04:14.250> to<00:04:14.910> a<00:04:14.940> which<00:04:15.450> is<00:04:15.600> 1/9

00:04:16.990 --> 00:04:17.000 
go G f-sharp G up to a which is 1/9

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:26.870 
go G f-sharp G up to a which is 1/9
so<00:04:18.000> here's<00:04:18.300> nice<00:04:25.040> so<00:04:26.040> the<00:04:26.310> way<00:04:26.430> to<00:04:26.460> get<00:04:26.730> this

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:26.880 
so here's nice so the way to get this

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:29.240 
so here's nice so the way to get this
into<00:04:27.150> your<00:04:27.300> playing<00:04:27.570> is<00:04:27.870> to<00:04:28.590> learn<00:04:28.800> it<00:04:28.980> in<00:04:29.100> all

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:29.250 
into your playing is to learn it in all

00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:32.900 
into your playing is to learn it in all
keys<00:04:29.640> and<00:04:30.500> do<00:04:31.500> it<00:04:31.590> in<00:04:31.680> different<00:04:32.070> tempos<00:04:32.490> do<00:04:32.820> it

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:32.910 
keys and do it in different tempos do it

00:04:32.910 --> 00:04:35.960 
keys and do it in different tempos do it
as<00:04:33.000> triplets<00:04:33.510> do<00:04:33.690> it<00:04:33.810> as<00:04:33.900> 16<00:04:34.440> for<00:04:35.430> example<00:04:35.820> if

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:35.970 
as triplets do it as 16 for example if

00:04:35.970 --> 00:04:38.060 
as triplets do it as 16 for example if
this<00:04:36.120> was<00:04:36.300> triplets<00:04:36.930> it<00:04:37.110> would<00:04:37.200> be<00:04:37.290> that<00:04:37.800> I<00:04:37.830> de

00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:38.070 
this was triplets it would be that I de

00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:43.130 
this was triplets it would be that I de
da<00:04:38.220> de<00:04:38.280> de<00:04:38.490> da<00:04:38.640> de<00:04:38.700> de<00:04:38.940> da<00:04:39.090> de<00:04:39.150> de<00:04:40.850> or<00:04:41.870> if<00:04:42.870> it<00:04:43.020> was

00:04:43.130 --> 00:04:43.140 
da de de da de de da de de or if it was

00:04:43.140 --> 00:04:49.850 
da de de da de de da de de or if it was
16<00:04:43.590> to<00:04:43.740> be<00:04:43.890> da<00:04:44.250> da<00:04:44.520> da<00:04:44.820> da<00:04:45.120> da<00:04:45.390> da<00:04:45.660> da<00:04:45.960> da<00:04:46.230> da

00:04:49.850 --> 00:04:49.860 

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:52.730 

and<00:04:50.450> you<00:04:51.450> don't<00:04:51.600> have<00:04:51.720> to<00:04:51.870> accent<00:04:52.320> it<00:04:52.440> that<00:04:52.590> way

00:04:52.730 --> 00:04:52.740 
and you don't have to accent it that way

00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:54.560 
and you don't have to accent it that way
but<00:04:52.800> I<00:04:52.950> was<00:04:53.040> just<00:04:53.190> trying<00:04:53.460> to<00:04:53.520> show<00:04:53.820> you<00:04:53.850> how

00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:54.570 
but I was just trying to show you how

00:04:54.570 --> 00:04:56.060 
but I was just trying to show you how
the<00:04:54.630> different<00:04:55.110> feels<00:04:55.350> would<00:04:55.530> work<00:04:55.710> really

00:04:56.060 --> 00:04:56.070 
the different feels would work really

00:04:56.070 --> 00:04:58.700 
the different feels would work really
try<00:04:56.580> to<00:04:56.610> explore<00:04:57.300> it<00:04:57.450> in<00:04:57.600> a<00:04:57.720> way<00:04:57.900> beyond<00:04:58.290> just

00:04:58.700 --> 00:04:58.710 
try to explore it in a way beyond just

00:04:58.710 --> 00:05:01.100 
try to explore it in a way beyond just
learning<00:04:58.980> the<00:04:59.430> two<00:05:00.060> examples<00:05:00.660> that<00:05:00.900> I've

00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:01.110 
learning the two examples that I've

00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:02.690 
learning the two examples that I've
notated<00:05:01.680> for<00:05:01.920> you

00:05:02.690 --> 00:05:02.700 
notated for you

00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:06.140 
notated for you
they<00:05:03.630> are<00:05:04.140> licks<00:05:04.530> until<00:05:05.160> they<00:05:05.370> become<00:05:05.730> part<00:05:06.060> of

00:05:06.140 --> 00:05:06.150 
they are licks until they become part of

00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:07.370 
they are licks until they become part of
your<00:05:06.300> vocabulary<00:05:06.450> then<00:05:07.140> they're<00:05:07.350> just

00:05:07.370 --> 00:05:07.380 
your vocabulary then they're just

00:05:07.380 --> 00:05:09.800 
your vocabulary then they're just
musical<00:05:08.070> ideas<00:05:08.580> that<00:05:08.880> you<00:05:08.970> can<00:05:09.120> reference<00:05:09.360> at

00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:09.810 
musical ideas that you can reference at

00:05:09.810 --> 00:05:12.680 
musical ideas that you can reference at
any<00:05:09.930> point<00:05:10.320> that<00:05:10.530> are<00:05:10.650> in<00:05:10.770> your<00:05:10.950> head<00:05:11.190> and<00:05:11.690> can
