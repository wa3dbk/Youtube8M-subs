00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:39.950 
effectively each stage of this video
will<00:01:38.399> build<00:01:38.670> the<00:01:38.850> skills<00:01:39.210> that<00:01:39.390> will<00:01:39.690> enable

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
will build the skills that will enable

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:43.630 
will build the skills that will enable
you<00:01:40.380> to<00:01:40.409> make<00:01:40.830> the<00:01:41.009> final<00:01:41.429> project<00:01:42.000> the<00:01:42.479> stool

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:43.640 
you to make the final project the stool

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:46.760 
you to make the final project the stool
and<00:01:44.640> this<00:01:45.390> will<00:01:45.600> all<00:01:45.899> be<00:01:45.929> achieved<00:01:46.530> with

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770 
and this will all be achieved with

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:51.229 
and this will all be achieved with
accuracy<00:01:47.369> sharpness<00:01:48.360> and<00:01:48.600> technique
