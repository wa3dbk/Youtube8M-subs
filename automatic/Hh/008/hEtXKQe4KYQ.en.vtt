00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:33.630 
use this video for this I've actually

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:35.780 
use this video for this I've actually
put<00:00:33.870> in<00:00:33.989> this<00:00:34.050> code<00:00:34.290> so<00:00:34.559> many<00:00:34.739> times<00:00:35.010> it<00:00:35.579> says

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:35.790 
put in this code so many times it says

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:41.869 
put in this code so many times it says
iPod<00:00:37.430> disabled<00:00:38.430> connect<00:00:39.090> iTunes<00:00:40.879> so

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879 
iPod disabled connect iTunes so

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:46.729 
iPod disabled connect iTunes so
basically<00:00:42.420> I<00:00:42.540> put<00:00:42.809> this<00:00:42.960> code<00:00:43.559> in<00:00:43.590> a<00:00:43.920> lot<00:00:44.570> and<00:00:45.739> I

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:46.739 
basically I put this code in a lot and I

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:49.220 
basically I put this code in a lot and I
can't<00:00:47.039> use<00:00:47.280> it<00:00:47.489> because<00:00:47.789> there's<00:00:48.719> a<00:00:48.809> passcode

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 
can't use it because there's a passcode

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:54.139 
can't use it because there's a passcode
on<00:00:49.289> it<00:00:49.590> so<00:00:51.110> what<00:00:52.110> I'm<00:00:52.289> going<00:00:52.410> to<00:00:52.469> do<00:00:52.820> this<00:00:53.820> is<00:00:53.969> at

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149 
on it so what I'm going to do this is at

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:59.450 
on it so what I'm going to do this is at
8<00:00:54.780> gigabyte<00:00:56.300> iPod<00:00:57.300> Touch<00:00:57.510> 3rd<00:00:57.780> generation<00:00:58.460> of

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:00.920 
8 gigabyte iPod Touch 3rd generation of
the<00:00:59.579> looks<00:00:59.760> of<00:00:59.910> it<00:01:00.059> as<00:01:00.270> a<00:01:00.300> really<00:01:00.719> fast

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:00.930 
the looks of it as a really fast

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:02.540 
the looks of it as a really fast
processor<00:01:01.530> it's<00:01:01.649> fairly<00:01:01.829> fast<00:01:02.070> with<00:01:02.219> mine<00:01:02.520> I

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
processor it's fairly fast with mine I

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:04.490 
processor it's fairly fast with mine I
can't<00:01:02.910> really<00:01:03.030> tell<00:01:03.210> because<00:01:03.510> mine<00:01:03.870> looks<00:01:04.350> the

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
can't really tell because mine looks the

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:06.920 
can't really tell because mine looks the
same<00:01:04.710> but<00:01:05.700> we'll<00:01:05.909> find<00:01:06.150> out<00:01:06.390> when<00:01:06.570> I<00:01:06.630> plug<00:01:06.810> it
