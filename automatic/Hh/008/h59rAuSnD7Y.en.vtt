00:00:03.250 --> 00:00:06.250
 this is how the story of complex numbers begins 

00:00:14.409 --> 00:00:18.289
 although today we are very familiar with the concept of number this was elaborated 

00:00:18.289 --> 00:00:21.050
 very slowly through the times 

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:25.779
 even in recent times tribes that maintained very primitive norms of life 

00:00:25.779 --> 00:00:28.839
 they had numerical concepts far behind 

00:00:28.839 --> 00:00:33.019
 for example there are cases in which there was no name for larger quantities 

00:00:33.019 --> 00:00:34.159
 what 3 

00:00:34.159 --> 00:00:38.459
 in others for slightly larger numbers similar terms were used 

00:00:38.459 --> 00:00:40.160
 many or countless 

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:43.940
 if we go back to the time of the four great civilizations of the world 

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:46.180
 ancient western 

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:47.610
 Babylon egypt 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:51.530
 Greece and Rome we will see what will live together and Greeks developed elevated 

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:53.510
 math knowledge 

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:57.960
 it is known that its numbering system was 60 basis of difference from the current 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:00.130
 which is base 10 that is 

00:01:00.130 --> 00:01:04.300
 they divided the unit into 60 parts in a similar way to how we divided an hour 

00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:05.770
 in 60 minutes 

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:10.070
 the Sumerians also used this numbering system and performed 

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:12.450
 complicated arithmetic calculations 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:16.480
 although the Egyptians did not make such significant contributions as the 

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:20.630
 Greeks to the development of numbers has found an interesting document 

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:25.000
 which shows that they already handled some simple fractions 

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.890
 this document is called the ring papyrus 

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:32.590
 it was written under the reign of the king ken in real potosí towards the thousand 600 before 

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:33.680
 of Christ 

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:36.800
 and apparently it's a transcription of an older writing 

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:40.830
 that would go back to the reign of amenhotep tied to menem is third 

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:45.640
 12 dynasty 1850 1800 before Jesus Christ 

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:50.580
 in this papyrus there are some rules to perform addition and subtraction of 

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:52.470
 fractions 

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:56.510
 when an exact distribution had to be made, they did not show 

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:57.790
 calculation problems 

00:01:57.790 --> 00:02:03.010
 however if you had to divide 42 loaves between 10 people the operation would 

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:03.980
 complicated 

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:08.330
 in these cases the Babylonians used the decimal number four commands 

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:12.470
 while the Egyptians with a more primitive numbering system 

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:16.670
 they needed the fractions to express these divisions not exact 

00:02:17.469 --> 00:02:22.510
 they knew the fractions of numerator one and denominator 2 3 4 and so on 

00:02:22.509 --> 00:02:25.999
 in addition to the fractions two third and three fourth 

00:02:25.999 --> 00:02:29.849
 in the rim papyrus a very heavy calculation method is proposed that 

00:02:29.849 --> 00:02:32.049
 allows to divide two between 19 

00:02:32.049 --> 00:02:36.060
 the Chinese also knew the fractions and knew they would reduce common 

00:02:36.059 --> 00:02:37.009
 denominator 

00:02:37.009 --> 00:02:40.009
 they called the numerator son and mother the denominator 

00:02:43.559 --> 00:02:47.229
 among all the peoples of antiquity it was the Greeks who 

00:02:47.229 --> 00:02:50.979
 made the most valuable contributions to the development of the concept of 

00:02:50.979 --> 00:02:51.739
 number 

00:02:51.739 --> 00:02:54.890
 the Pythagorean school five centuries before Christ 

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:58.490
 discovered that only with natural numbers and fractions can they 

00:02:58.490 --> 00:03:01.009
 take all possible measures 

00:03:01.009 --> 00:03:05.499
 they believed that chaos entered their ordered world and called such a reason logos 

00:03:05.499 --> 00:03:06.589
 or irrational 

00:03:06.589 --> 00:03:10.069
 In India the origins of our numbering system were captured 

00:03:10.729 --> 00:03:15.379
 the principle of position relative value of the figures the nine figures and the 0 

00:03:15.379 --> 00:03:18.709
 appear in the works of the Indian mathematician gupta range 

00:03:18.709 --> 00:03:23.179
 during this time the Indian mathematicians also accepted the solutions 

00:03:23.179 --> 00:03:27.199
 negative of the equations while admitting as roots the numbers 

00:03:27.199 --> 00:03:30.659
 of other numbers that could not be expressed by rational numbers 

00:03:31.679 --> 00:03:35.609
 was the merchant leonardo pisano who after having learned that the 

00:03:35.609 --> 00:03:39.149
 art of the Arabs on their commercial trips through Algeria Sicily and 

00:03:39.149 --> 00:03:43.589
 East gathered all the knowledge of arithmetic and algebra of his time 

00:03:43.589 --> 00:03:46.419
 in a work called liberated yes thousand 202 

00:03:46.419 --> 00:03:49.139
 who spread the Indian numbering in Europe 

00:03:49.139 --> 00:03:53.749
 until then in Europe the negative numbers had been avoided but in 

00:03:53.749 --> 00:03:58.309
 the 13th century the Italian mathematician fibonacci in a problem concerning the 

00:03:58.309 --> 00:04:02.159
 money that has no positive solution observed its need 

00:04:02.159 --> 00:04:06.589
 during the 14th century the negative numbers were called numeréri al 

00:04:06.589 --> 00:04:07.399
 southeast 

00:04:07.399 --> 00:04:11.929
 it should have waited until the 15th century for the French jacket will express by 

00:04:11.929 --> 00:04:17.479
 first time a negative number isolated in the equation 4 x equal -2 during the 

00:04:17.479 --> 00:04:18.680
 16th century 

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:22.440
 the use of the horizontal bar was popularized to separate the terms of 

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:25.779
 a fraction nomenclature of Arabic origin 

00:04:25.779 --> 00:04:29.460
 oo although some problems were solved others arose 

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:35.300
 when trying to solve second degree equations like x 2 2x +5 equaled 

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:38.879
 and others of greater degree began to find expressions 

00:04:38.879 --> 00:04:42.749
 like the square root of -16 that they did not know how to interpret 

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:48.610
 Cardano was during this same century who proposed a new type of numbers 

00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:53.020
 that he called fictitious as a solution to the square roots of numbers 

00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:54.229
 negative 

00:04:54.229 --> 00:04:58.249
 the problem of irrational numbers was not completely resolved until the 

00:04:58.249 --> 00:05:02.839
 17th century when fermat French mathematician who can be considered the 

00:05:02.839 --> 00:05:06.650
 father of modern number theory proved that expressions like root 

00:05:06.650 --> 00:05:09.830
 square three were not rational numbers 

00:05:09.830 --> 00:05:13.639
 only the problem of negative roots remained to be solved 

00:05:13.639 --> 00:05:19.539
 and this happened in 1777 when I hear he gave the square root of -1 the name 

00:05:19.539 --> 00:05:21.080
 of today imaginary 

00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:26.230
 in 1799 of aussa out to solve the problem by demonstrating that the solutions 

00:05:26.229 --> 00:05:30.800
 of any algebraic equation whatever its degree belonged to a 

00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:34.300
 set of numbers that he called complexes that he considered 

00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:38.110
 composed of an ordinary fireman today we call it real number plus a 

00:05:38.110 --> 00:05:42.219
 multiple of the square root of -1 lahmad imaginary unit 

00:05:42.219 --> 00:05:46.610
 as has been proven to arrive at concepts that today seem simple 

00:05:46.610 --> 00:05:51.379
 and logicians have had to spend many centuries and many cultures each of the 

00:05:51.379 --> 00:05:54.569
 which has made its contributions to the knowledge of the numbers
