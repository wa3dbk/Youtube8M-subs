00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:33.000 
sure you could play all these games but

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.470 
sure you could play all these games but
it<00:00:33.930> clearly<00:00:34.500> it<00:00:35.010> looks<00:00:35.850> like<00:00:35.969> advanced

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:36.480 
it clearly it looks like advanced

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:41.270 
it clearly it looks like advanced
warfare<00:00:37.170> is<00:00:38.600> not<00:00:39.600> only<00:00:39.809> staying<00:00:40.500> in<00:00:40.860> the<00:00:41.010> realm

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280 
warfare is not only staying in the realm

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:47.959 
warfare is not only staying in the realm
of<00:00:41.460> a<00:00:42.090> good<00:00:43.020> first<00:00:43.320> person<00:00:43.770> shooter<00:00:45.379> but<00:00:46.640> it<00:00:47.640> is

00:00:47.959 --> 00:00:47.969 
of a good first person shooter but it is

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:50.600 
of a good first person shooter but it is
capitalized<00:00:48.719> on<00:00:49.170> a<00:00:49.590> lot<00:00:50.010> of<00:00:50.039> things<00:00:50.340> that

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610 
capitalized on a lot of things that

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:55.670 
capitalized on a lot of things that
other<00:00:51.329> games<00:00:51.960> seem<00:00:52.680> to<00:00:53.039> always<00:00:53.960> not<00:00:54.960> capture

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 
other games seem to always not capture

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:58.490 
other games seem to always not capture
and<00:00:55.890> that<00:00:56.640> is<00:00:56.820> essence<00:00:57.300> of<00:00:57.480> great<00:00:57.809> other<00:00:58.079> games

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
and that is essence of great other games

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:02.180 
and that is essence of great other games
and<00:00:58.910> simplifying<00:01:00.530> simplifying<00:01:01.530> them<00:01:01.949> in

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190 
and simplifying simplifying them in

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:04.549 
and simplifying simplifying them in
their<00:01:02.609> game<00:01:02.879> and<00:01:03.180> I<00:01:03.750> think<00:01:03.960> that's<00:01:04.110> what<00:01:04.350> makes

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
their game and I think that's what makes

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:07.609 
their game and I think that's what makes
that<00:01:05.549> get<00:01:05.850> their<00:01:06.150> green<00:01:06.390> their<00:01:06.780> games<00:01:07.080> great<00:01:07.409> I

00:02:21.869 --> 00:02:21.879 
a great game and has a lot of

00:02:21.879 --> 00:02:24.449 
a great game and has a lot of
intricacies<00:02:22.540> about<00:02:23.109> it<00:02:23.319> and<00:02:23.560> that<00:02:23.920> MMO

00:02:24.459 --> 00:02:26.819 
intricacies about it and that MMO
feeling<00:02:24.939> to<00:02:25.120> it<00:02:25.329> and<00:02:25.680> developing<00:02:26.680> your

00:02:26.819 --> 00:02:26.829 
feeling to it and developing your

00:02:26.829 --> 00:02:29.520 
feeling to it and developing your
character<00:02:27.340> and<00:02:27.370> facial<00:02:28.060> expressions<00:02:28.290> and<00:02:29.290> do

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:29.530 
character and facial expressions and do

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:31.319 
character and facial expressions and do
your<00:02:29.709> own<00:02:29.739> hair<00:02:30.129> styles<00:02:30.639> and<00:02:30.849> all<00:02:30.939> that<00:02:31.150> stuff

some people that know what they're doing

00:03:19.449 --> 00:03:21.990 
some people that know what they're doing
because<00:03:20.319> that<00:03:20.680> shit<00:03:20.859> just<00:03:20.919> looks<00:03:21.370> crazy<00:03:21.790> good

00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:22.000 
because that shit just looks crazy good

and<00:03:22.859> you<00:03:23.859> know<00:03:24.040> so<00:03:25.949> my<00:03:26.949> opinion<00:03:27.220> is<00:03:27.609> that<00:03:28.620> I

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:29.620 
and you know so my opinion is that I

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:31.619 
and you know so my opinion is that I
think<00:03:30.430> right<00:03:30.729> now<00:03:30.939> we're<00:03:31.209> in<00:03:31.239> a<00:03:31.419> situation

00:03:31.619 --> 00:03:31.629 
think right now we're in a situation

00:03:31.629 --> 00:03:34.949 
think right now we're in a situation
where<00:03:32.439> there's<00:03:32.680> a<00:03:32.769> lot<00:03:32.979> of<00:03:33.009> great<00:03:33.400> games<00:03:33.959> for

00:03:34.949 --> 00:03:34.959 
where there's a lot of great games for

00:03:34.959 --> 00:03:37.559 
where there's a lot of great games for
graphics<00:03:35.949> but<00:03:36.669> I<00:03:37.000> don't<00:03:37.150> think<00:03:37.299> there's<00:03:37.479> a<00:03:37.509> lot

00:03:37.559 --> 00:03:37.569 
graphics but I don't think there's a lot

00:03:37.569 --> 00:03:40.409 
graphics but I don't think there's a lot
of<00:03:37.629> great<00:03:37.930> games<00:03:38.229> for<00:03:38.620> pick<00:03:39.430> up<00:03:39.579> and<00:03:39.759> play<00:03:40.000> for

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:21.449 
know what are you going to decide to do
I<00:04:17.829> mean<00:04:18.699> you<00:04:18.849> if<00:04:19.030> you<00:04:19.650> invest<00:04:20.650> in<00:04:20.889> one<00:04:21.159> game<00:04:21.430> you

00:04:21.449 --> 00:04:21.459 
I mean you if you invest in one game you

00:04:21.459 --> 00:04:24.300 
I mean you if you invest in one game you
cannot<00:04:21.969> invest<00:04:22.360> in<00:04:22.539> the<00:04:22.659> author<00:04:22.870> and<00:04:23.260> I<00:04:24.070> think

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:24.310 
cannot invest in the author and I think

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:26.010

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:26.020 
they do that on purpose but at the same

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:27.110 
they do that on purpose but at the same
time<00:04:26.260> you're<00:04:26.440> killing

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:27.120
