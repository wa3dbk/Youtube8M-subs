months at any rate they probably will be
in<00:03:30.080> the<00:03:30.200> future<00:03:30.379> but<00:03:31.280> I<00:03:31.340> think<00:03:31.580> perhaps<00:03:31.700> more

00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:32.060 
in the future but I think perhaps more

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:33.910 
in the future but I think perhaps more
interesting<00:03:32.659> than<00:03:32.810> that<00:03:32.870> is<00:03:33.290> the<00:03:33.500> possibility

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:33.920 
interesting than that is the possibility

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:36.610 
interesting than that is the possibility
that<00:03:34.250> as<00:03:34.670> you<00:03:35.000> get<00:03:35.269> used<00:03:35.420> to<00:03:35.629> the<00:03:35.750> format<00:03:36.140> you

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:36.620 
that as you get used to the format you

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:38.619 
that as you get used to the format you
might<00:03:36.799> be<00:03:36.950> able<00:03:37.040> to<00:03:37.280> contribute<00:03:38.150> some<00:03:38.510> of

00:03:38.619 --> 00:03:38.629 
might be able to contribute some of

00:03:38.629 --> 00:03:40.690 
might be able to contribute some of
these<00:03:38.720> cases<00:03:39.200> get<00:03:39.620> your<00:03:39.769> name<00:03:39.980> on<00:03:40.010> them<00:03:40.340> and

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:40.700 
these cases get your name on them and

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:43.000 
these cases get your name on them and
you'll<00:03:41.180> see<00:03:41.329> that<00:03:41.420> the<00:03:41.540> format<00:03:41.959> is<00:03:42.200> there's<00:03:42.950> a

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:43.010 
you'll see that the format is there's a

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:45.069 
you'll see that the format is there's a
stem<00:03:43.700> with<00:03:44.120> some<00:03:44.299> information<00:03:44.780> about<00:03:44.810> the

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:48.590 
patient and a week or so later perhaps

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:50.380 
patient and a week or so later perhaps
after<00:03:48.799> some<00:03:49.160> discussion<00:03:49.340> behind<00:03:50.000> the<00:03:50.150> scenes

on the discussion forums will post the

00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:55.390 
on the discussion forums will post the
answer<00:03:53.060> and<00:03:53.269> then<00:03:53.720> you<00:03:54.470> can<00:03:54.680> see<00:03:54.980> what<00:03:55.220> the

00:03:55.390 --> 00:03:55.400 
answer and then you can see what the

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:56.890 
answer and then you can see what the
experts<00:03:55.879> thought<00:03:56.120> or<00:03:56.390> what<00:03:56.480> you<00:03:56.690> thought
