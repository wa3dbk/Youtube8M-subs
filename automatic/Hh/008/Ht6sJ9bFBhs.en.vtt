00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
thing that is very different is that

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:04.939 
thing that is very different is that
skill<00:01:03.239> based<00:01:03.420> matchmaking<00:01:03.629> is<00:01:04.229> gonna<00:01:04.619> be<00:01:04.769> on

for<00:01:05.519> those<00:01:05.670> of<00:01:05.820> you<00:01:05.909> that<00:01:06.030> are<00:01:06.150> not<00:01:06.299> aware

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
for those of you that are not aware

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:09.410 
for those of you that are not aware
trials<00:01:07.110> of<00:01:07.200> Osiris<00:01:07.619> has<00:01:07.860> no<00:01:08.340> skill<00:01:09.180> based

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
trials of Osiris has no skill based

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:12.620 
trials of Osiris has no skill based
matchmaking<00:01:09.860> what<00:01:10.860> so<00:01:11.340> ever<00:01:11.549> which<00:01:12.240> may<00:01:12.570> seem

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
matchmaking what so ever which may seem

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:14.810 
matchmaking what so ever which may seem
a<00:01:13.049> little<00:01:13.260> weird<00:01:13.380> to<00:01:13.740> people<00:01:13.979> but<00:01:14.549> the<00:01:14.670> reason

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
a little weird to people but the reason

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:16.310 
a little weird to people but the reason
they<00:01:15.030> did<00:01:15.180> that<00:01:15.210> is<00:01:15.509> because<00:01:15.659> they<00:01:15.930> wanted<00:01:16.229> the

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
they did that is because they wanted the

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:18.350 
they did that is because they wanted the
trials<00:01:16.680> of<00:01:16.740> Osiris<00:01:17.159> experience<00:01:17.820> to<00:01:18.030> just<00:01:18.240> be

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
trials of Osiris experience to just be

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:20.270 
trials of Osiris experience to just be
the<00:01:18.540> least<00:01:18.810> laggy<00:01:19.229> possible<00:01:19.860> and<00:01:20.040> I<00:01:20.070> think

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
the least laggy possible and I think

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:22.160 
the least laggy possible and I think
they<00:01:20.369> definitely<00:01:20.490> succeeded<00:01:21.180> I've<00:01:21.780> only

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
they definitely succeeded I've only

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:24.140 
they definitely succeeded I've only
experienced<00:01:22.920> lag<00:01:23.250> when<00:01:23.490> I<00:01:23.520> play<00:01:23.790> really

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150 
experienced lag when I play really

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:25.969 
experienced lag when I play really
really<00:01:24.509> really<00:01:24.659> late<00:01:24.990> and<00:01:25.259> they're<00:01:25.560> obviously

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
really really late and they're obviously

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:28.429 
really really late and they're obviously
finding<00:01:26.280> it<00:01:26.640> very<00:01:26.700> difficult<00:01:26.939> to<00:01:27.659> match<00:01:28.170> me<00:01:28.380> up

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:28.439 
finding it very difficult to match me up

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:30.380 
finding it very difficult to match me up
against<00:01:28.710> people<00:01:28.979> that<00:01:29.040> are<00:01:29.220> close<00:01:29.520> to<00:01:29.549> me<00:01:30.119> so

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.390 
against people that are close to me so

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:32.480 
against people that are close to me so
that's<00:01:30.960> why<00:01:31.200> skill<00:01:31.680> based<00:01:31.829> matchmaking<00:01:32.009> is

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490 
that's why skill based matchmaking is

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:35.990 
that's why skill based matchmaking is
not<00:01:32.700> in<00:01:32.850> Charles<00:01:33.119> of<00:01:33.180> a<00:01:33.240> Cyrus<00:01:33.840> river<00:01:34.829> this<00:01:35.220> but

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
not in Charles of a Cyrus river this but

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.060 
not in Charles of a Cyrus river this but
in<00:01:36.119> elimination<00:01:36.750> it's<00:01:37.020> gonna<00:01:37.290> be<00:01:37.530> there<00:01:37.829> so

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:38.070 
in elimination it's gonna be there so

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:39.289 
in elimination it's gonna be there so
you're<00:01:38.159> gonna<00:01:38.280> be<00:01:38.460> put<00:01:38.640> against<00:01:38.970> people<00:01:39.270> that

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:39.299 
you're gonna be put against people that

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:42.020 
you're gonna be put against people that
have<00:01:39.720> a<00:01:39.990> similar<00:01:40.259> or<00:01:40.740> at<00:01:41.130> least<00:01:41.340> somewhat

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030 
have a similar or at least somewhat

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:44.780 
have a similar or at least somewhat
close<00:01:42.390> skill<00:01:42.840> set<00:01:43.110> to<00:01:43.290> yourself<00:01:44.070> another

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:44.790 
close skill set to yourself another

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:45.770 
close skill set to yourself another
thing<00:01:45.030> that<00:01:45.060> is<00:01:45.270> different<00:01:45.299> is<00:01:45.720> that

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
thing that is different is that

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:48.080 
thing that is different is that
matchmaking<00:01:46.259> is<00:01:46.890> enabled<00:01:47.310> for<00:01:47.369> elimination

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090 
matchmaking is enabled for elimination

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:49.550 
matchmaking is enabled for elimination
so<00:01:48.360> this<00:01:48.540> is<00:01:48.659> gonna<00:01:48.780> be<00:01:48.990> really<00:01:49.110> good<00:01:49.409> for

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:49.560 
so this is gonna be really good for

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:51.530 
so this is gonna be really good for
people<00:01:49.740> who<00:01:50.189> haven't<00:01:50.790> been<00:01:51.030> able<00:01:51.270> to

people who haven't been able to

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:53.929 
people who haven't been able to
experience<00:01:52.049> trowel<00:01:52.860> Cyrus<00:01:53.250> because<00:01:53.820> they

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:53.939 
experience trowel Cyrus because they

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:55.609 
experience trowel Cyrus because they
cannot<00:01:54.270> find<00:01:54.600> a<00:01:54.780> group<00:01:55.049> if<00:01:55.229> you<00:01:55.350> want<00:01:55.530> to

cannot find a group if you want to

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:57.530 
cannot find a group if you want to
experience<00:01:55.950> the<00:01:56.280> elimination<00:01:56.939> game<00:01:57.119> type<00:01:57.360> you

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:57.540 
experience the elimination game type you

00:01:57.540 --> 00:01:59.749 
experience the elimination game type you
can<00:01:57.689> hop<00:01:57.899> in<00:01:58.110> and<00:01:58.380> you'll<00:01:58.799> be<00:01:58.950> randomly<00:01:59.399> put

to find a team to play with when Charles
Osiris<00:02:24.610> actually<00:02:25.120> comes<00:02:25.390> around<00:02:25.750> now<00:02:26.110> the

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:26.170 
Osiris actually comes around now the

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:28.440 
Osiris actually comes around now the
most<00:02:26.820> interesting<00:02:27.820> thing<00:02:28.030> to<00:02:28.060> me<00:02:28.300> about

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:28.450 
most interesting thing to me about

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:30.420 
most interesting thing to me about
having<00:02:28.930> elimination<00:02:29.650> as<00:02:29.800> a<00:02:29.830> game<00:02:30.190> type

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:30.430 
having elimination as a game type

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:33.240 
having elimination as a game type
separate<00:02:31.180> from<00:02:31.630> trials<00:02:31.960> of<00:02:32.050> Osiris<00:02:32.500> is<00:02:32.710> that

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:33.250 
separate from trials of Osiris is that

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:36.030 
separate from trials of Osiris is that
map<00:02:33.550> rotation<00:02:34.240> is<00:02:34.480> going<00:02:34.990> to<00:02:35.170> be<00:02:35.320> on<00:02:35.560> so<00:02:35.830> as<00:02:35.920> you

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:36.040 
map rotation is going to be on so as you

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:38.130 
map rotation is going to be on so as you
guys<00:02:36.130> know<00:02:36.190> trials<00:02:36.970> of<00:02:37.030> Osiris<00:02:37.420> it's<00:02:37.630> one<00:02:37.900> map

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:38.140 
guys know trials of Osiris it's one map

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:40.500 
guys know trials of Osiris it's one map
per<00:02:38.500> week<00:02:38.740> you<00:02:38.980> don't<00:02:39.190> get<00:02:39.430> random<00:02:39.970> maps<00:02:40.180> every

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:40.510 
per week you don't get random maps every

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:42.750 
per week you don't get random maps every
time<00:02:40.690> you<00:02:40.810> go<00:02:40.960> in<00:02:41.170> but<00:02:41.740> in<00:02:41.830> elimination<00:02:42.460> you're

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:42.760 
time you go in but in elimination you're

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:45.540 
time you go in but in elimination you're
actually<00:02:42.940> going<00:02:43.390> to<00:02:43.600> be<00:02:43.680> experiencing<00:02:44.680> every

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:45.550 
actually going to be experiencing every

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:47.730 
actually going to be experiencing every
single<00:02:46.030> map<00:02:46.330> now<00:02:46.600> my<00:02:46.780> assumption<00:02:47.410> is<00:02:47.650> that

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:47.740 
single map now my assumption is that

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:49.770 
single map now my assumption is that
they're<00:02:48.280> not<00:02:48.460> going<00:02:48.670> to<00:02:48.730> be<00:02:48.850> putting<00:02:49.090> a<00:02:49.300> map<00:02:49.540> in

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:49.780 
they're not going to be putting a map in

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:51.900 
they're not going to be putting a map in
the<00:02:49.840> Elimination<00:02:50.620> playlist<00:02:51.070> that<00:02:51.250> isn't

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:51.910 
the Elimination playlist that isn't

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:54.750 
the Elimination playlist that isn't
gonna<00:02:52.060> also<00:02:52.360> be<00:02:52.600> a<00:02:52.780> child<00:02:53.200> of<00:02:53.410> Osiris<00:02:53.950> map<00:02:54.250> so

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:54.760 
gonna also be a child of Osiris map so

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:56.730 
gonna also be a child of Osiris map so
this<00:02:54.910> is<00:02:54.940> gonna<00:02:55.150> be<00:02:55.330> letting<00:02:55.600> us<00:02:55.720> know<00:02:55.750> what

00:02:56.730 --> 00:02:56.740 
this is gonna be letting us know what

00:02:56.740 --> 00:02:58.500 
this is gonna be letting us know what
maps<00:02:57.040> were<00:02:57.250> gonna<00:02:57.430> actually<00:02:57.610> be<00:02:57.940> able<00:02:58.150> to<00:02:58.270> play

00:02:58.500 --> 00:02:58.510 
maps were gonna actually be able to play

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:01.500 
maps were gonna actually be able to play
in<00:02:58.930> elimination<00:02:59.350> in<00:03:00.220> Charles<00:03:00.760> Osiris<00:03:01.240> so

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:01.510 
in elimination in Charles Osiris so

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:03.720 
in elimination in Charles Osiris so
that's<00:03:01.870> really<00:03:02.140> interesting<00:03:02.410> to<00:03:02.950> me<00:03:03.070> I<00:03:03.250> get<00:03:03.610> to

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:03.730 
that's really interesting to me I get to

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:05.160 
that's really interesting to me I get to
see<00:03:03.850> which<00:03:04.000> maps<00:03:04.330> I'm<00:03:04.540> gonna<00:03:04.750> be<00:03:04.870> looking

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:05.170 
see which maps I'm gonna be looking

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:06.690 
see which maps I'm gonna be looking
forward<00:03:05.500> to<00:03:05.620> the<00:03:05.770> ones<00:03:05.980> that<00:03:06.130> I'm<00:03:06.220> not<00:03:06.460> so

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:06.700 
forward to the ones that I'm not so

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:08.490 
forward to the ones that I'm not so
looking<00:03:07.060> forward<00:03:07.270> to<00:03:07.450> you<00:03:08.020> get<00:03:08.170> to<00:03:08.290> create

00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:08.500 
looking forward to you get to create

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:10.500 
looking forward to you get to create
strategies<00:03:08.950> for<00:03:09.580> each<00:03:09.700> of<00:03:09.850> the<00:03:09.940> maps<00:03:10.180> so<00:03:10.360> when

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:10.510 
strategies for each of the maps so when

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:12.090 
strategies for each of the maps so when
it<00:03:10.600> finally<00:03:10.810> comes<00:03:11.020> around<00:03:11.530> you<00:03:11.710> know<00:03:11.860> how<00:03:12.040> to

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:12.100 
it finally comes around you know how to

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:14.970 
it finally comes around you know how to
play<00:03:12.430> it<00:03:12.760> there's<00:03:13.270> just<00:03:13.540> so<00:03:13.990> many<00:03:14.170> benefits<00:03:14.500> to

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:14.980 
play it there's just so many benefits to

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:17.460 
play it there's just so many benefits to
having<00:03:15.220> the<00:03:15.670> map<00:03:15.910> rotation<00:03:16.750> and<00:03:16.990> I<00:03:17.290> just

00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:17.470 
having the map rotation and I just
