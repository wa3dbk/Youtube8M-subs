gun we're gonna spray it with a little
bit<00:01:09.060> of<00:01:09.090> silicon<00:01:09.510> right<00:01:09.659> okay<00:01:09.930> and<00:01:10.260> we<00:01:10.890> can

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010 
bit of silicon right okay and we can

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:12.890 
bit of silicon right okay and we can
slide<00:01:11.250> the<00:01:11.400> band<00:01:11.549> straight<00:01:11.970> through<00:01:12.299> ah

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:14.909 
and then a little bit more silicone on

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:17.030 
and then a little bit more silicone on
that<00:01:15.360> slide<00:01:15.659> there<00:01:15.689> and<00:01:16.350> make<00:01:16.530> it<00:01:16.680> slip<00:01:16.890> right

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
that slide there and make it slip right

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:19.010 
that slide there and make it slip right
through<00:01:17.100> makes<00:01:17.610> it<00:01:17.729> slip<00:01:17.880> right<00:01:18.060> through<00:01:18.119> okay

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
through makes it slip right through okay

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:22.280 
through makes it slip right through okay
so<00:01:19.380> that's<00:01:19.530> the<00:01:19.650> easy<00:01:19.799> one<00:01:20.040> okay<00:01:20.840> now<00:01:21.840> what's

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:22.290 
so that's the easy one okay now what's

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:24.140 
so that's the easy one okay now what's
what<00:01:22.619> about<00:01:22.799> this<00:01:22.950> is<00:01:23.159> not<00:01:23.430> you<00:01:23.640> tie<00:01:23.790> this<00:01:23.850> to
