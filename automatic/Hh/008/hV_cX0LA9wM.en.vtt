00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:20.310 
today we're going to hand prop the

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:22.040 
today we're going to hand prop the
Luscombe<00:00:20.760> which<00:00:21.029> we<00:00:21.180> have<00:00:21.330> to<00:00:21.480> do<00:00:21.600> every<00:00:21.840> time

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:22.050 
Luscombe which we have to do every time

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:24.200 
Luscombe which we have to do every time
we<00:00:22.260> apply<00:00:22.890> the<00:00:22.949> Luscombe<00:00:23.460> hand<00:00:23.670> profit

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:24.210 
we apply the Luscombe hand profit

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:28.339 
we apply the Luscombe hand profit
it's<00:00:25.170> a<00:00:25.289> continental<00:00:25.830> a<00:00:25.949> 65<00:00:26.720> 1946<00:00:27.720> Luscombe<00:00:28.140> a

00:00:28.339 --> 00:00:28.349 
it's a continental a 65 1946 Luscombe a

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:30.830 
it's a continental a 65 1946 Luscombe a
day<00:00:28.590> that's<00:00:29.150> interestingly<00:00:30.150> enough

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:30.840 
day that's interestingly enough

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:33.760 
day that's interestingly enough
apparently<00:00:31.260> fitted<00:00:31.800> with<00:00:31.980> an<00:00:32.099> 8c<00:00:32.550> fuselage

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:33.770 
apparently fitted with an 8c fuselage

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:36.350 
apparently fitted with an 8c fuselage
but<00:00:34.770> it's<00:00:35.040> registered<00:00:35.969> as<00:00:36.090> an<00:00:36.210> 8<00:00:36.329> a

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:36.360 
but it's registered as an 8 a

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:40.610 
but it's registered as an 8 a
certificated<00:00:37.140> as<00:00:37.410> an<00:00:37.590> 8<00:00:37.710> a<00:00:37.860> and<00:00:39.500> so<00:00:40.500> we're

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
certificated as an 8 a and so we're

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:42.170 
certificated as an 8 a and so we're
going<00:00:40.710> to<00:00:40.770> hand<00:00:41.040> prop<00:00:41.309> it<00:00:41.489> also<00:00:41.640> has<00:00:41.940> the

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:42.180 
going to hand prop it also has the

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:44.779 
going to hand prop it also has the
factory<00:00:42.840> observer<00:00:43.260> windows<00:00:43.770> the<00:00:44.219> plexiglass

00:00:44.779 --> 00:00:44.789 
factory observer windows the plexiglass

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:46.810 
factory observer windows the plexiglass
windows<00:00:45.210> very<00:00:45.480> that's<00:00:45.899> very<00:00:45.989> nice<00:00:46.320> for

00:00:46.810 --> 00:00:46.820 
windows very that's very nice for

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:50.510 
windows very that's very nice for
visibility<00:00:47.820> and<00:00:48.780> the<00:00:49.530> plane<00:00:49.770> right<00:00:50.010> now<00:00:50.039> is

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:50.520 
visibility and the plane right now is

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:53.450 
visibility and the plane right now is
tied<00:00:51.239> down<00:00:51.449> secured<00:00:52.140> in<00:00:52.320> the<00:00:52.770> back<00:00:52.949> it's<00:00:53.280> got

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460 
tied down secured in the back it's got

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:55.580 
tied down secured in the back it's got
chalks<00:00:53.789> under<00:00:54.059> the<00:00:54.149> wheels<00:00:54.360> ok<00:00:55.289> so<00:00:55.350> we

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
chalks under the wheels ok so we

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:59.810 
chalks under the wheels ok so we
verified<00:00:55.860> full<00:00:56.850> rich<00:00:57.120> carb<00:00:57.629> Heat's<00:00:57.899> off<00:00:58.820> mags

verified full rich carb Heat's off mags
are<00:01:00.120> off<00:01:01.579> gonna<00:01:02.579> give<00:01:02.760> it<00:01:02.879> three<00:01:03.270> shots<00:01:03.930> of<00:01:04.260> gas

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
are off gonna give it three shots of gas

the throttle lock on it just to provide

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:20.510 
the throttle lock on it just to provide
a<00:01:18.810> little<00:01:19.020> more<00:01:19.110> incentive<00:01:19.590> for<00:01:19.860> it<00:01:20.100> not<00:01:20.250> to

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
a little more incentive for it not to

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:25.219 
a little more incentive for it not to
move<00:01:20.670> in<00:01:21.080> and<00:01:22.080> then<00:01:22.470> I'm<00:01:22.619> going<00:01:22.860> to<00:01:24.110> you<00:01:25.110> know

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
move in and then I'm going to you know

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:28.310 
move in and then I'm going to you know
crack<00:01:25.590> it<00:01:25.740> a<00:01:25.799> little<00:01:25.979> bit<00:01:26.900> tighten<00:01:27.900> it<00:01:28.080> up<00:01:28.170> a

now<00:01:40.200> is<00:01:40.229> we're<00:01:40.590> gonna<00:01:40.710> pull<00:01:41.280> it<00:01:41.430> through<00:01:41.759> four

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
now is we're gonna pull it through four

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:44.030 
now is we're gonna pull it through four
blades<00:01:42.540> to<00:01:42.869> charge<00:01:43.110> the<00:01:43.320> cylinders<00:01:43.799> that's

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:44.040 
blades to charge the cylinders that's

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:45.710 
blades to charge the cylinders that's
two<00:01:44.220> complete<00:01:44.579> revolutions<00:01:44.729> so<00:01:45.450> four

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:45.720 
two complete revolutions so four

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:46.999 
two complete revolutions so four
cylinder<00:01:46.020> engine<00:01:46.290> that<00:01:46.320> will<00:01:46.500> give<00:01:46.649> us<00:01:46.799> a

00:01:46.999 --> 00:01:47.009 
cylinder engine that will give us a

00:01:47.009 --> 00:02:04.260 
cylinder engine that will give us a
charge<00:01:47.939> in<00:01:48.149> every<00:01:48.390> cylinder

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:04.270 

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:07.809 

anytime<00:02:05.270> we're<00:02:05.569> ready<00:02:05.750> for<00:02:05.840> it<00:02:06.109> to<00:02:06.259> start<00:02:06.819> go

00:02:07.809 --> 00:02:07.819 
anytime we're ready for it to start go

00:02:07.819 --> 00:02:15.479 
anytime we're ready for it to start go
inside<00:02:08.179> let's<00:02:08.360> turn<00:02:08.599> the<00:02:08.690> magnet<00:02:09.019> on<00:02:12.849> contact

00:02:15.479 --> 00:02:15.489 
inside let's turn the magnet on contact

00:02:15.489 --> 00:02:18.970 
inside let's turn the magnet on contact
turn<00:02:16.489> to<00:02:16.610> Meg's<00:02:16.819> hobby<00:02:17.150> verify<00:02:17.720> throttle<00:02:18.410> I'm

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:18.980 
turn to Meg's hobby verify throttle I'm

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:24.100 
turn to Meg's hobby verify throttle I'm
gonna<00:02:19.160> turn<00:02:19.340> the<00:02:19.549> fuel<00:02:19.790> off<00:02:22.660> turn<00:02:23.660> the<00:02:23.840> fuel

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:24.110 
gonna turn the fuel off turn the fuel

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:25.930 
gonna turn the fuel off turn the fuel
off<00:02:24.379> just<00:02:24.709> in<00:02:24.890> case<00:02:25.040> it<00:02:25.220> does<00:02:25.430> get<00:02:25.640> away<00:02:25.760> from

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:25.940 
off just in case it does get away from

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:45.400 
off just in case it does get away from
me<00:02:41.680> pink<00:02:42.680> very<00:02:43.099> easy
