and that's within the first two minutes
and<00:02:08.220> I<00:02:09.090> look<00:02:09.390> at<00:02:09.509> that<00:02:09.750> the<00:02:10.619> score<00:02:10.920> and<00:02:11.099> I

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:11.190 
and I look at that the score and I

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:11.980 
and I look at that the score and I
decided

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:11.990 
decided

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:14.500 
decided
pretty<00:02:12.290> fast<00:02:12.500> nuke<00:02:12.770> so<00:02:13.010> I<00:02:13.220> decided<00:02:14.090> to<00:02:14.150> call<00:02:14.330> it

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:14.510 
pretty fast nuke so I decided to call it

in two-minute nooope to end a day and I

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:19.840 
in two-minute nooope to end a day and I
do<00:02:17.480> this<00:02:17.780> to<00:02:18.050> be<00:02:18.170> a<00:02:18.200> little<00:02:18.410> dramatic<00:02:18.670> jump<00:02:19.670> in

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:19.850 
do this to be a little dramatic jump in

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:22.030 
do this to be a little dramatic jump in
the<00:02:19.940> air<00:02:20.060> and<00:02:20.270> a<00:02:20.450> slow<00:02:20.810> motion<00:02:21.260> you<00:02:21.890> know<00:02:22.010> i

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:22.040
