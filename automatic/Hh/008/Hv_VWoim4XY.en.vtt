00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:00.499 
get more nutrition from if you can find
the<00:01:58.710> raw<00:01:58.860> tahini<00:01:59.280> I'm<00:02:00.030> going<00:02:00.180> to<00:02:00.240> save<00:02:00.360> the

cilantro so after I do my fierce puree
that's<00:02:04.020> it<00:02:04.290> we're<00:02:04.439> just<00:02:04.469> going<00:02:04.649> to<00:02:04.710> puree<00:02:05.009> it

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:05.040 
that's it we're just going to puree it

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:09.660 
that's it we're just going to puree it
up

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:09.670 

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:13.710 

now<00:02:10.240> hemp<00:02:10.509> seeds<00:02:10.960> are<00:02:11.140> super<00:02:12.130> high<00:02:12.430> in<00:02:12.970> the

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:13.720 
now hemp seeds are super high in the

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:16.410 
now hemp seeds are super high in the
full<00:02:13.990> spectrum<00:02:14.350> of<00:02:14.770> amino<00:02:15.160> acids<00:02:15.580> so<00:02:15.910> they're

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:16.420 
full spectrum of amino acids so they're

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:21.840 
full spectrum of amino acids so they're
really<00:02:16.690> helping<00:02:17.140> serve<00:02:17.530> you<00:02:17.800> I<00:02:19.230> mean<00:02:20.230> I<00:02:20.440> I<00:02:21.130> eat

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:21.850 
really helping serve you I mean I I eat

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:23.760 
really helping serve you I mean I I eat
mostly<00:02:22.180> vegetarian<00:02:22.360> and<00:02:23.050> where<00:02:23.200> I<00:02:23.230> people<00:02:23.709> are

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:23.770 
mostly vegetarian and where I people are

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:24.840 
mostly vegetarian and where I people are
I<00:02:23.800> was<00:02:23.890> like<00:02:23.980> where<00:02:24.130> to<00:02:24.280> get<00:02:24.400> your<00:02:24.490> protein

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:24.850 
I was like where to get your protein

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:25.830 
I was like where to get your protein
where<00:02:25.060> you<00:02:25.120> get<00:02:25.240> your<00:02:25.270> protein

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:25.840 
where you get your protein

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:27.480 
where you get your protein
well<00:02:26.140> greens<00:02:26.500> have<00:02:26.770> a<00:02:26.830> lot<00:02:26.980> of<00:02:27.010> protein<00:02:27.370> this

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:27.490 
well greens have a lot of protein this

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:30.540 
well greens have a lot of protein this
has<00:02:27.670> protein<00:02:28.230> but<00:02:29.230> also<00:02:29.320> our<00:02:29.740> seeds<00:02:30.100> and<00:02:30.459> our

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:30.550 
has protein but also our seeds and our

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:32.910 
has protein but also our seeds and our
nuts<00:02:30.990> have<00:02:31.990> an<00:02:32.110> incredible<00:02:32.530> amount<00:02:32.740> of

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:32.920 
nuts have an incredible amount of

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:36.000 
nuts have an incredible amount of
protein<00:02:33.760> so<00:02:34.120> it's<00:02:34.840> false<00:02:35.200> to<00:02:35.470> believe<00:02:35.709> that<00:02:35.890> we

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:36.010 
protein so it's false to believe that we

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:40.070 
protein so it's false to believe that we
need<00:02:36.280> to<00:02:36.340> eat<00:02:36.760> animal<00:02:37.540> foods<00:02:37.690> we<00:02:37.989> really<00:02:38.200> don't

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:40.080 
need to eat animal foods we really don't

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:42.630 
need to eat animal foods we really don't
we're<00:02:41.080> just<00:02:41.200> gonna<00:02:41.290> put<00:02:41.530> that<00:02:41.709> cilantro<00:02:42.130> in

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:42.640 
we're just gonna put that cilantro in

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:48.000 
we're just gonna put that cilantro in
puree<00:02:43.239> it<00:02:43.390> up<00:02:43.510> for<00:02:43.690> just<00:02:43.840> a<00:02:43.930> moment<00:02:44.080> I<00:02:47.010> can

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:48.010 
puree it up for just a moment I can

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:51.630 
puree it up for just a moment I can
smell<00:02:48.370> that<00:02:48.430> it<00:02:48.850> smells<00:02:49.120> so<00:02:49.480> good<00:02:50.220> so<00:02:51.220> fresh

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:51.640 
smell that it smells so good so fresh

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:54.630 
smell that it smells so good so fresh
and<00:02:52.269> cilantro<00:02:53.070> it's<00:02:54.070> a<00:02:54.190> heavy<00:02:54.370> metal

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:54.640 
and cilantro it's a heavy metal

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:57.120 
and cilantro it's a heavy metal
detoxifier<00:02:55.209> so<00:02:55.420> it<00:02:55.480> actually<00:02:55.750> helps<00:02:55.959> pull<00:02:56.320> the

00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:57.130 
detoxifier so it actually helps pull the

00:02:57.130 --> 00:02:58.979 
detoxifier so it actually helps pull the
aluminum<00:02:57.670> it's<00:02:57.910> like<00:02:58.000> we<00:02:58.120> get<00:02:58.209> aluminum<00:02:58.480> in

00:02:58.979 --> 00:02:58.989 
aluminum it's like we get aluminum in

00:02:58.989 --> 00:03:02.340 
aluminum it's like we get aluminum in
our<00:02:59.110> bodies<00:02:59.500> from<00:02:59.769> pots<00:03:00.489> and<00:03:00.700> pans<00:03:00.940> from<00:03:01.480> you

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:02.350 
our bodies from pots and pans from you

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:04.650 
our bodies from pots and pans from you
know<00:03:02.440> flatware<00:03:03.040> from<00:03:03.400> serving<00:03:03.790> utensils<00:03:04.330> and

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:04.660 
know flatware from serving utensils and

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:07.410 
know flatware from serving utensils and
so<00:03:04.870> eating<00:03:05.230> cilantro<00:03:05.980> actually<00:03:06.430> binds<00:03:06.790> with

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:07.420 
so eating cilantro actually binds with

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:08.790 
so eating cilantro actually binds with
those<00:03:07.630> metals<00:03:08.080> and<00:03:08.260> pulls<00:03:08.440> them<00:03:08.560> out<00:03:08.620> of<00:03:08.739> your

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:08.800 
those metals and pulls them out of your

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:11.040 
those metals and pulls them out of your
body<00:03:09.360> so<00:03:10.360> it's<00:03:10.480> a<00:03:10.510> really<00:03:10.690> good<00:03:10.780> thing<00:03:10.840> to<00:03:10.930> know

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:11.050 
body so it's a really good thing to know

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:14.580 
body so it's a really good thing to know
so<00:03:11.950> we've<00:03:12.610> just<00:03:12.720> cut<00:03:13.720> up<00:03:13.870> some<00:03:14.140> beautiful

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:50.700 
these are sprouted germinated seeds so
