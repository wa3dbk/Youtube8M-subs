00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:31.000 
what the science was and that's really

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.960 
what the science was and that's really
important<00:03:31.660> to<00:03:31.780> me<00:03:31.890> science<00:03:32.890> is<00:03:33.160> the<00:03:33.490> base<00:03:33.670> of

00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:33.970

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:39.910 
the second part that I have to look the

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:42.360 
the second part that I have to look the
at<00:03:40.090> though<00:03:40.390> is<00:03:40.420> the<00:03:40.780> practicality<00:03:41.290> is<00:03:42.010> this<00:03:42.250> a

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:42.370 
at though is the practicality is this a

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:44.340 
at though is the practicality is this a
practical<00:03:42.880> item<00:03:43.420> that<00:03:43.660> patients<00:03:44.050> are<00:03:44.170> gonna

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:44.350 
practical item that patients are gonna

00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:46.860 
practical item that patients are gonna
really<00:03:44.650> go<00:03:44.950> home<00:03:45.130> and<00:03:45.400> do<00:03:45.610> and<00:03:46.000> because<00:03:46.660> of<00:03:46.690> the

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:46.870 
really go home and do and because of the

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:49.410 
really go home and do and because of the
flavor<00:03:47.200> the<00:03:47.680> consistency<00:03:48.430> the<00:03:48.459> ease<00:03:48.880> of<00:03:48.910> use

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:49.420 
flavor the consistency the ease of use

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:52.650 
flavor the consistency the ease of use
the<00:03:50.380> the<00:03:50.880> the<00:03:51.880> results<00:03:52.330> that<00:03:52.450> they're<00:03:52.540> gonna

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:52.660 
the the the results that they're gonna

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:54.690 
the the the results that they're gonna
see<00:03:52.900> in<00:03:53.020> the<00:03:53.140> end<00:03:53.320> they're<00:03:53.950> gonna<00:03:54.070> do<00:03:54.310> it<00:03:54.490> and

00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:54.700 
see in the end they're gonna do it and

00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:57.780 
see in the end they're gonna do it and
they<00:03:55.270> are<00:03:55.480> doing<00:03:55.870> it<00:03:56.050> and<00:03:56.170> that<00:03:56.590> is<00:03:56.890> really

00:03:57.780 --> 00:03:57.790 
they are doing it and that is really

00:03:57.790 --> 00:04:00.840 
they are doing it and that is really
rewarding<00:03:57.970> for<00:03:58.420> me<00:03:58.900> the<00:03:59.620> last<00:03:59.860> thing<00:04:00.220> is<00:04:00.580> the
