oops on Facebook is what we'll call this

00:03:57.740 --> 00:04:00.100 
oops on Facebook is what we'll call this
one<00:03:57.800> okay<00:03:58.490> but<00:03:58.790> as<00:03:58.910> I<00:03:59.030> said<00:03:59.090> for<00:03:59.420> our<00:03:59.450> iframes

00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:00.110 
one okay but as I said for our iframes

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:01.960 
one okay but as I said for our iframes
it<00:04:00.380> doesn't<00:04:00.650> make<00:04:00.770> any<00:04:00.950> difference<00:04:01.130> that<00:04:01.790> bit

00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:01.970 
it doesn't make any difference that bit

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:03.130 
it doesn't make any difference that bit
so<00:04:02.090> you<00:04:02.180> could<00:04:02.330> essentially<00:04:02.660> just<00:04:02.870> leave<00:04:03.020> it

00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:03.140 
so you could essentially just leave it

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:05.860 
so you could essentially just leave it
blank<00:04:03.260> and<00:04:04.030> then<00:04:05.030> just<00:04:05.240> click<00:04:05.450> install

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:05.870 
blank and then just click install

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:11.590 
blank and then just click install
WordPress<00:04:07.810> okay<00:04:08.840> and<00:04:09.220> that's<00:04:10.220> it<00:04:10.600> you've
