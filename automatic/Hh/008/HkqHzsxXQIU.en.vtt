 will be the one that says what goes on in your mind 

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:08.330
 he wants not to say it 

00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:11.890
 of hope 

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:11.890
 They were orders whatever 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:26.729
 I do not fight because I'm not, he did not throw 

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:29.080
 destroyed my effort what he put in my 

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:31.350
 hands to create 

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:31.350
 now 

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:14.640
 unawareness being that is created when 

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:14.640
 maximum your life is worth more 

00:02:15.239 --> 00:02:19.890
 in your hands nothing more 

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:26.630
 when you feel a return 

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:30.070
 support for the war 

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:30.070
 at all pretoria 

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:05.360
 life project 

00:03:02.819 --> 00:03:08.770
 when I go to war 

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:08.770
 with a difficulty 

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:13.830
 do not lose who is 

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:18.340
 Do you want more 

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:21.629
 cristian does not want more 

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:21.629
 mean they do not add 

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:34.870
 granny 

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:38.830
 dead this good here my granny and 

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:42.040
 you will eat all the food they will cover it 

00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:44.200
 an idea to make new music for the 

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:45.880
 children from the rock and roll of 

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:47.890
 rock fusion and music 

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:50.490
 Ecuadorian because we want to merge the 

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:50.490
 Arts 

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:54.040
 to children of our country 

00:03:56.990 --> 00:04:00.370
 i 

00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:02.230
 good morning and a month called with him to 

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:04.420
 peralta I want to send a greeting to my 

00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:07.060
 grandparents to my parents and my sister 

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:09.879
 general the music that you listen to 

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:12.370
 children is music made 50 70 ago or 

00:04:09.879 --> 00:04:15.040
 100 years ago but the children already have 

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:17.380
 other ways of seeing the world have another 

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:19.000
 way of perceiving the things that we 

00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:20.949
 surrounds even with the internet the 

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:23.139
 television and so on then the idea 

00:04:20.949 --> 00:04:24.820
 main thing was to do that to tell the 

00:04:23.139 --> 00:04:27.190
 children who also have other options 

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:30.009
 of music to children I love the 

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:31.509
 music they love the puppets have 

00:04:30.009 --> 00:04:34.840
 our message that is super clear 

00:04:31.509 --> 00:04:36.639
 then the idea comes naturally to them 

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:39.340
 to all the devices from the same 

00:04:36.639 --> 00:04:42.040
 live rock and education 

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:43.610
 invited especially to xylophone that 

00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:50.090
 its over there 

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:53.419
 is a little while the bathroom went for me 

00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:55.819

00:04:53.419 --> 00:04:58.219

00:04:55.819 --> 00:05:01.000
