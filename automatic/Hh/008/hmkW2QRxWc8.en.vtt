00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:07.879
 nv De Scheepvaart manages no fewer than 173 bridges. 

00:00:07.879 --> 00:00:12.769
 Thanks to regular and thorough checks, the necessary maintenance work can be done in time 

00:00:12.769 --> 00:00:13.769
 to happen. 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:16.820
 In addition, nv De Scheepvaart is responsible for raising the bridges. 

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:20.550
 This is necessary to realize a larger capacity on the channels. 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:26.050
 Inland shipping plays an important role in the development of Flanders as a logistics 

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:27.130
 pivot of Europe. 

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:31.529
 Paula Palmans, spokesperson nv De Scheepvaart: "The Albert Canal has 62 bridges in total. 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:36.969
 To build it further, into a waterway with European interest, all bridges must be one 

00:00:36.969 --> 00:00:40.039
 have a clearance clearance of 9.10 m. 

00:00:40.039 --> 00:00:43.280
 Then ships can sail with four layers of containers. 

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:48.600
 At this moment only 3 layers of containers can pass through, so that is a profit 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:50.129
 of 25%. " 

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:54.329
 In the province of Limburg there are 33 bridges over the Albert Canal. 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:01:00.219
 Only 9 bridges are high enough at the moment, 11 bridges are relatively simple 

00:01:00.219 --> 00:01:04.860
 adapted and 13 bridges have to be completely rebuilt. " 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:11.050
 By 2020 at the latest, all bridges over the Albert Canal must have the required clearance 

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:12.050
 to have. 

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:15.760
 The cost of the works is estimated at 130 million euros. 

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:18.730
 A cost that pays for itself in the short term. 

00:01:18.730 --> 00:01:24.630
 Paula Palmans: "In addition, De Scheepvaart naturally also continues to invest in the smaller channels. 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:34.310
 For example, in Bree on the Zuid-Willemsvaart, new bridges are being built in Beek and Tongerlo. Met 

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:40.120
 these works nv De Scheepvaart builds bridges to the future. 

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:45.600
 For Flanders and Limburg, this means a major economic and ecological one 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:46.600
 added value."
