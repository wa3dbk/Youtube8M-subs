one before the surgery I couldn't walk
very<00:00:22.050> fast<00:00:22.619> I<00:00:22.920> walked<00:00:23.160> the<00:00:23.539> dogs<00:00:24.539> I<00:00:24.750> have<00:00:24.990> the

have to stop every 15-20 seconds to
catch<00:00:34.320> my<00:00:34.530> breath<00:00:35.300> actually<00:00:36.300> this<00:00:36.420> is<00:00:36.570> not

00:00:36.709 --> 00:00:36.719 
catch my breath actually this is not

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:38.660 
catch my breath actually this is not
right<00:00:36.899> I<00:00:36.960> gotta<00:00:37.290> have<00:00:37.469> this<00:00:37.590> correct<00:00:37.920> the

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:38.670 
right I gotta have this correct the

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:40.880 
right I gotta have this correct the
diagnosis<00:00:39.300> is<00:00:39.510> called<00:00:40.020> a<00:00:40.200> or<00:00:40.410> deck<00:00:40.559> valve

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890 
diagnosis is called a or deck valve

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:43.700 
diagnosis is called a or deck valve
stenosis<00:00:41.660> so<00:00:42.660> when<00:00:42.840> a<00:00:42.870> normal<00:00:43.230> person<00:00:43.559> when<00:00:43.680> a

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:43.710 
stenosis so when a normal person when a

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:46.100 
stenosis so when a normal person when a
heart<00:00:43.890> squeezes<00:00:44.370> the<00:00:45.090> valve<00:00:45.329> starts<00:00:45.750> closed

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.110 
heart squeezes the valve starts closed

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:49.790 
heart squeezes the valve starts closed
and<00:00:46.620> it<00:00:46.739> opens<00:00:47.129> wide<00:00:47.450> through<00:00:48.450> time<00:00:48.840> those

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
and it opens wide through time those

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:53.479 
and it opens wide through time those
valves<00:00:50.629> scar<00:00:51.629> down<00:00:51.870> they<00:00:52.469> start<00:00:52.800> to<00:00:52.949> fail<00:00:53.190> and

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:53.489 
valves scar down they start to fail and

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:55.819 
valves scar down they start to fail and
so<00:00:54.180> when<00:00:54.360> the<00:00:54.449> heart<00:00:54.629> squeezes<00:00:55.050> instead<00:00:55.800> of

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
so when the heart squeezes instead of

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:57.650 
so when the heart squeezes instead of
the<00:00:55.980> valve<00:00:56.190> to<00:00:56.370> start<00:00:56.610> and<00:00:56.730> close<00:00:57.000> and<00:00:57.329> opening

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
the valve to start and close and opening

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:00.680 
the valve to start and close and opening
wide<00:00:57.899> it<00:00:58.620> starts<00:00:58.980> closed<00:00:59.309> and<00:00:59.670> opens<00:01:00.239> just<00:01:00.480> a

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690 
wide it starts closed and opens just a

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:02.990 
wide it starts closed and opens just a
little<00:01:00.930> bit<00:01:01.050> that<00:01:02.010> makes<00:01:02.190> it<00:01:02.250> really<00:01:02.460> hard<00:01:02.579> for

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
little bit that makes it really hard for

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:04.609 
little bit that makes it really hard for
the<00:01:03.270> heart<00:01:03.480> to<00:01:03.629> squeeze<00:01:03.870> blood<00:01:04.110> through<00:01:04.409> it<00:01:04.500> to

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619 
the heart to squeeze blood through it to

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:07.580 
the heart to squeeze blood through it to
the<00:01:04.710> body<00:01:04.949> and<00:01:05.420> pressure<00:01:06.420> backs<00:01:06.900> up<00:01:07.200> into<00:01:07.350> the

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
the body and pressure backs up into the

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:09.200 
the body and pressure backs up into the
lungs<00:01:07.799> and<00:01:08.040> people<00:01:08.369> typically<00:01:08.729> present

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
lungs and people typically present

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:11.000

they<00:01:14.220> couldn't<00:01:14.549> do<00:01:14.640> open<00:01:15.150> heart<00:01:15.299> because<00:01:15.750> I

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
they couldn't do open heart because I

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:18.679 
they couldn't do open heart because I
had<00:01:16.350> open-heart<00:01:16.560> surgery<00:01:17.460> back<00:01:18.330> and<00:01:18.540> hold

injection<00:01:25.590> Tavarez<00:01:26.430> it's<00:01:26.790> a<00:01:26.880> new<00:01:27.060> procedure

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
injection Tavarez it's a new procedure

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:30.039 
injection Tavarez it's a new procedure
it's<00:01:27.900> been<00:01:28.170> designed<00:01:28.320> for<00:01:28.740> patients<00:01:29.430> who<00:01:29.460> are

00:01:30.039 --> 00:01:30.049 
it's been designed for patients who are

00:01:30.049 --> 00:01:32.660 
it's been designed for patients who are
too<00:01:31.049> sick<00:01:31.409> to<00:01:31.619> go<00:01:31.829> through<00:01:32.009> a<00:01:32.100> traditional

open<00:01:33.180> heart<00:01:33.479> valve<00:01:33.960> replacement<00:01:34.220> so<00:01:35.220> what's

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:35.400 
open heart valve replacement so what's

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:37.039 
open heart valve replacement so what's
been<00:01:35.549> developed<00:01:35.880> is<00:01:35.970> another<00:01:36.240> way<00:01:36.450> to<00:01:36.479> give

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:37.049 
been developed is another way to give

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:39.230 
been developed is another way to give
them<00:01:37.320> a<00:01:37.439> new<00:01:37.619> valve<00:01:37.950> and<00:01:38.310> what<00:01:38.880> is<00:01:39.000> actually

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 
them a new valve and what is actually

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:41.510 
them a new valve and what is actually
performed<00:01:39.960> is<00:01:40.110> that<00:01:40.290> a<00:01:40.439> valve<00:01:40.979> is<00:01:41.220> placed

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
performed is that a valve is placed

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:44.060 
performed is that a valve is placed
inside<00:01:41.790> a<00:01:42.000> stent<00:01:42.479> which<00:01:42.869> is<00:01:43.079> a<00:01:43.110> coiled<00:01:43.770> metal

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.070 
inside a stent which is a coiled metal

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:46.789 
inside a stent which is a coiled metal
tube<00:01:44.310> and<00:01:44.640> that<00:01:45.329> stent<00:01:45.659> is<00:01:45.810> advanced<00:01:46.380> from<00:01:46.649> the

tube and that stent is advanced from the

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:48.859 
tube and that stent is advanced from the
leg<00:01:46.979> artery<00:01:47.399> all<00:01:47.880> the<00:01:48.240> way<00:01:48.390> up<00:01:48.420> backwards

through the aorta to the heart and it's
put<00:01:52.200> inside<00:01:52.619> the<00:01:52.920> old<00:01:53.100> valve<00:01:53.810> by<00:01:54.810> deploying
