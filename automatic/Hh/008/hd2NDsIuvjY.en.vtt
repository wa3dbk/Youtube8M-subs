00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.100 
you know we're off to a good start

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:24.350 
you know we're off to a good start
a<00:01:20.280> lot<00:01:20.550> of<00:01:20.670> new<00:01:20.790> faces<00:01:21.030> to<00:01:21.690> work<00:01:22.200> in<00:01:23.360> with

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
a lot of new faces to work in with

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:27.050 
a lot of new faces to work in with
coaches<00:01:25.020> and<00:01:25.140> players<00:01:25.610> but<00:01:26.610> something<00:01:27.000> you

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
coaches and players but something you

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:31.580 
coaches and players but something you
should<00:01:27.180> be<00:01:27.270> excited<00:01:27.720> about<00:01:27.840> I<00:01:30.020> think<00:01:31.020> we<00:01:31.380> got<00:01:31.560> a

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:31.590 
should be excited about I think we got a

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:33.320 
should be excited about I think we got a
lot<00:01:31.920> of<00:01:31.979> returning<00:01:32.400> players<00:01:32.550> we've<00:01:33.060> got<00:01:33.210> some

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:33.330 
lot of returning players we've got some

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:34.940 
lot of returning players we've got some
good<00:01:33.510> young<00:01:33.750> players<00:01:34.050> in<00:01:34.290> here<00:01:34.440> to<00:01:34.530> push<00:01:34.740> them

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
good young players in here to push them

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:36.770 
good young players in here to push them
and<00:01:35.070> I<00:01:35.160> think<00:01:35.430> it's<00:01:35.610> it's<00:01:36.270> going<00:01:36.420> to<00:01:36.479> be<00:01:36.540> really

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
and I think it's it's going to be really

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:37.940 
and I think it's it's going to be really
good<00:01:36.930> for<00:01:37.140> us<00:01:37.260> that<00:01:37.290> when<00:01:37.590> able<00:01:37.770> to<00:01:37.830> have

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
good for us that when able to have

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:40.580 
good for us that when able to have
competition<00:01:38.460> at<00:01:38.729> all<00:01:38.820> positions<00:01:39.450> and<00:01:39.690> I<00:01:39.869> think

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
competition at all positions and I think

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:41.960 
competition at all positions and I think
all<00:01:40.770> the<00:01:40.890> guys<00:01:41.040> that<00:01:41.070> would<00:01:41.430> be<00:01:41.550> ready<00:01:41.790> or

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:41.970 
all the guys that would be ready or

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:42.950 
all the guys that would be ready or
they're<00:01:42.090> going<00:01:42.180> to<00:01:42.270> sit<00:01:42.509> in<00:01:42.570> watching<00:01:42.900> these

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960 
they're going to sit in watching these

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:46.070 
they're going to sit in watching these
young<00:01:43.170> guys<00:01:43.320> plow<00:01:43.650> and<00:01:44.640> then<00:01:45.000> we<00:01:45.780> talked<00:01:46.020> about

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:46.080 
young guys plow and then we talked about

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:48.050 
young guys plow and then we talked about
earlier<00:01:46.500> but<00:01:46.710> first<00:01:47.190> few<00:01:47.400> days<00:01:47.580> just<00:01:47.610> in

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060 
earlier but first few days just in

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:52.850 
earlier but first few days just in
shorts<00:01:48.509> and<00:01:48.630> helmets<00:01:51.259> yeah<00:01:52.259> I<00:01:52.440> never<00:01:52.680> like

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:52.860 
shorts and helmets yeah I never like

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:55.040 
shorts and helmets yeah I never like
this<00:01:53.070> as<00:01:53.220> a<00:01:53.250> player<00:01:53.520> you<00:01:53.700> got<00:01:54.119> it<00:01:54.240> together<00:01:54.360> the

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:55.050 
this as a player you got it together the

00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:56.719 
this as a player you got it together the
first<00:01:55.290> three<00:01:55.500> days<00:01:55.680> are<00:01:55.950> difficult<00:01:56.460> to<00:01:56.580> hold

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:56.729 
first three days are difficult to hold

00:01:56.729 --> 00:01:58.219 
first three days are difficult to hold
your<00:01:57.000> attention<00:01:57.090> the<00:01:57.630> entire<00:01:57.930> practice

00:01:58.219 --> 00:01:58.229 
your attention the entire practice

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:00.380 
your attention the entire practice
especially<00:01:58.650> in<00:01:59.040> your<00:01:59.130> alignment<00:01:59.700> but<00:02:00.270> it's

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:00.390 
especially in your alignment but it's

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:02.000 
especially in your alignment but it's
very<00:02:00.570> important<00:02:01.170> to<00:02:01.260> the<00:02:01.380> time<00:02:01.590> they<00:02:01.770> need<00:02:01.920> to

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:02.010 
very important to the time they need to

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:04.550 
very important to the time they need to
get<00:02:02.130> the<00:02:02.390> footwork<00:02:03.390> down<00:02:03.630> their<00:02:03.990> assignments

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:04.560 
get the footwork down their assignments

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:05.960 
get the footwork down their assignments
down<00:02:04.770> really<00:02:05.130> know<00:02:05.310> what<00:02:05.460> you're<00:02:05.640> doing<00:02:05.670> and

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:05.970 
down really know what you're doing and

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:07.550 
down really know what you're doing and
get<00:02:06.120> on<00:02:06.210> the<00:02:06.270> same<00:02:06.480> page<00:02:06.540> but<00:02:07.110> you<00:02:07.140> almost<00:02:07.380> have

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:07.560 
get on the same page but you almost have

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:09.169 
get on the same page but you almost have
to<00:02:07.650> start<00:02:07.920> over<00:02:08.070> when<00:02:08.340> you<00:02:08.399> put<00:02:08.580> the<00:02:08.700> pads<00:02:08.940> on

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:09.179 
to start over when you put the pads on

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:11.449 
to start over when you put the pads on
so<00:02:09.450> these<00:02:09.840> are<00:02:10.050> the<00:02:10.200> aids<00:02:10.320> for<00:02:10.860> assignments

00:02:11.449 --> 00:02:11.459 
so these are the aids for assignments

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:16.760 
so these are the aids for assignments
the<00:02:11.550> techniques<00:02:11.970> very<00:02:12.209> cool

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:16.770 

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:23.270 

obviously<00:02:20.070> it<00:02:21.070> really<00:02:21.280> is<00:02:21.430> and<00:02:21.700> then<00:02:21.820> I<00:02:22.000> I

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:23.280 
obviously it really is and then I I

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:25.410 
obviously it really is and then I I
evaluate<00:02:24.280> a<00:02:24.310> little<00:02:24.520> bit<00:02:24.640> every<00:02:24.880> day<00:02:24.910> but<00:02:25.120> I

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:25.420 
evaluate a little bit every day but I

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:37.230 
evaluate a little bit every day but I
never<00:02:25.480> make<00:02:25.810> my<00:02:25.930> mind<00:02:26.140> up<00:02:26.230> to<00:02:26.410> prepare

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:37.240 

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:39.300 

you
