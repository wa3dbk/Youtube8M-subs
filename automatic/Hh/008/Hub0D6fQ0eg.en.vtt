open a window like this and if you look
in<00:02:25.450> it<00:02:25.540> you<00:02:25.750> can<00:02:25.780> have<00:02:25.930> bundles<00:02:26.470> these<00:02:27.250> bundles

00:02:27.539 --> 00:02:27.549 
in it you can have bundles these bundles

00:02:27.549 --> 00:02:31.020 
in it you can have bundles these bundles
and<00:02:27.970> these<00:02:29.189> packages<00:02:30.189> these<00:02:30.489> are<00:02:30.610> the<00:02:30.670> package

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:31.030 
and these packages these are the package

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:33.420 
and these packages these are the package
the<00:02:31.180> actual<00:02:31.480> apps<00:02:31.689> and<00:02:32.019> if<00:02:32.860> you<00:02:32.980> notice<00:02:33.099> these

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:33.430 
the actual apps and if you notice these

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:35.880 
the actual apps and if you notice these
packages<00:02:34.030> literally<00:02:34.750> have<00:02:34.959> the<00:02:35.349> icons<00:02:35.709> in

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:35.890 
packages literally have the icons in

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:38.100 
packages literally have the icons in
them<00:02:36.010> and<00:02:36.159> that's<00:02:36.879> how<00:02:37.030> theming<00:02:37.690> basically

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:38.110 
them and that's how theming basically

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:40.410 
them and that's how theming basically
works<00:02:38.640> so<00:02:39.640> now<00:02:39.849> we're<00:02:39.970> going<00:02:40.090> to<00:02:40.150> do<00:02:40.239> is<00:02:40.390> going

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:40.420 
works so now we're going to do is going

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:42.089 
works so now we're going to do is going
