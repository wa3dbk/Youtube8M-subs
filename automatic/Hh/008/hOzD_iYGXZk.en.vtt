00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.120
 these are the main ones 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:56.190
 questions that many patients 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:57.809
 ask over the years 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:59.699
 But let's get down to what matters. 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:01.440
 answer your questions 

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:04.290
 Here comes the question but the rock tone of mine 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:06.420
 doctor my nutritionist told me 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:08.460
 that eggs increase cholesterol and that 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:10.590
 This is going to hurt me and it can cause me 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:12.840
 heart disease of the future 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:16.020
 you accompanying my blog or my 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:18.330
 videocasts already read the article heard the 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:19.830
 on saturated fat and already 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:21.810
 understood that there is no relationship between 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:23.250
 increased cholesterol and diseases 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:25.259
 cardiac 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:26.549
 in the case of the egg makes a point of highlighting 

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:28.920
 again 

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:31.380
 there is no relation to the increase in 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:34.079
 consumption of eggs and increases cholesterol 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:36.030
 in the blood and even if there was not 

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:38.340
 would pose no risk 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:41.610
 This is myth, this is a lie. 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:43.470
 the good science or 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:45.570
 high-level studies. 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:47.070
 scientific evidence shows us 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:49.259
 just the opposite 

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:52.649
 eggs are functional foods or 

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:55.140
 they are critical to your health and 

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:57.540

 that exists in nature after all 

00:02:15.069 --> 00:02:18.069
 A chick is born a living being. 

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:20.260
 complete is really 

00:02:18.069 --> 00:02:22.870

 diabetics often even being 

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:42.190
 withdrawn 

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:44.410
 it is also worth noting that fat 

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:45.700
 present on the eggs is not fattening and 

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:48.700

 in vitamins here is the vitamin folate 

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:09.670
 b12 and others 

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:11.739

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:15.069

 looks tip 5 eggs are also rich in 

00:03:15.069 --> 00:03:20.109
 Protein eating two eggs could 

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:23.859
 increase by about 30% of the 

00:03:20.109 --> 00:03:26.220

00:03:23.859 --> 00:03:29.019
 high biological value protein 

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:32.799
