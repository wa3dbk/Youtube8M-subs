00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:55.950 
of it off because you still have that

the oil is not soaked all the way
through<00:01:57.719> there<00:01:57.899> so<00:01:58.469> that's<00:01:58.920> why<00:01:59.189> I'm<00:01:59.490> just

00:01:59.510 --> 00:01:59.520 
through there so that's why I'm just

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:02.840 
through there so that's why I'm just
kind<00:01:59.909> of<00:01:59.969> working<00:02:00.899> it<00:02:01.049> underneath<00:02:01.860> it<00:02:02.250> okay

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:02.850 
kind of working it underneath it okay

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:05.690 
kind of working it underneath it okay
now<00:02:03.299> you<00:02:03.360> might<00:02:03.810> wonder<00:02:03.990> why<00:02:04.500> does<00:02:05.250> the<00:02:05.490> oil

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:05.700 
now you might wonder why does the oil

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:06.859 
now you might wonder why does the oil
when<00:02:06.149> I<00:02:06.180> put<00:02:06.450> my

00:02:06.859 --> 00:02:06.869

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:08.749 
when I put my
and<00:02:06.960> oil<00:02:07.140> why<00:02:07.590> did<00:02:07.829> the<00:02:07.920> jamberries<00:02:08.369> not<00:02:08.550> come

and oil why did the jamberries not come
up<00:02:08.910> well<00:02:09.599> that's<00:02:09.959> because<00:02:10.379> you're<00:02:11.280> not
