00:00:00.179 --> 00:00:03.660
 how about movie friends gamers 

00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:05.459
 welcome another video from your world 

00:00:03.660 --> 00:00:07.289
 class truck plan the campaign of the 

00:00:05.459 --> 00:00:09.000
 goblins and good as you can see let's 

00:00:07.289 --> 00:00:10.950
 to see is to make this man of tip that 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.410
 well, it was not also like 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:14.970
 you can see already the bonuses are 100,000 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:17.820
 of gold and 6,000 of elixir asia and 

00:00:14.970 --> 00:00:19.410
 things start to get well nation and 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:21.240
 what friends lack afterwards to put still 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:22.560
 nicer to repair with the encryption 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:24.360
 of the video I put the troops that I 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:26.070
 I use and that good in general and you 

00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:28.920
 I'm asking you this one already 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:30.390
 troops level 3 or higher as what 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:31.920
 let's see here it's good to use some 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:33.600
 how many of value and if worth mothers 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:35.730
 including if they are activated 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:38.100
 the bombs you can here now if I 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:41.940
 came out here there are also some 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:43.230
 trapdoors with these around here and if I'm 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:45.620
 here you can have the level that 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:47.870
 you want double tribe do not hurry up 

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:49.699
 then we are going to launch a giant for 

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:52.040
 to distract the magician's tower and then 

00:00:49.699 --> 00:00:55.160
 we launched some 1520 archers so that 

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:57.170
 culminating in the magician's career we are going to 

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:59.149
 make more or less the knots with the 

00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:02.239
 bikers and that and we'll be ridding 

00:00:59.149 --> 00:01:04.369
 around 10 to 15 so you have to 

00:01:02.239 --> 00:01:06.470
 be careful because if not then well 

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:10.550
 can destroy the mortar because 

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:12.470
 released the 155 of 77 makes that I'm in 

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:14.320
 the magician's tower we do exactly the 

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:16.580
 same strategy from the top 

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:19.759
 I'm distracted in mortars by 

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:22.190
 the giant then we launched our the 

00:01:19.759 --> 00:01:23.539
 archers we go to all the few more 

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:27.530
 against us we have to each 

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:28.910
 around 25 to destroy the stake 

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:30.500
 that that vitola that worries me the most 

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:32.240
 is so that we can release the 

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:34.340
 balloon and good as the balloon ends 

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:36.200
 with everything else once that's done 

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:38.509
 already balloon for the band and you know how 

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:40.520
 goes this logo because it goes fast ending with 

00:01:38.509 --> 00:01:41.990
 thank you very much for your comments 

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:43.729

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:45.110
