00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.000 
into your return grill and then we have

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:43.790 
into your return grill and then we have

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:55.520 
that you get all this extra surface area
we<00:00:53.970> pleat<00:00:54.240> the<00:00:54.390> filter<00:00:54.780> so<00:00:55.110> that<00:00:55.230> you<00:00:55.350> have<00:00:55.500> a

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
we pleat the filter so that you have a

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:57.440 
we pleat the filter so that you have a
lower<00:00:55.860> airflow<00:00:56.400> restriction<00:00:56.760> through<00:00:57.120> a<00:00:57.150> bit

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850 
of all the excess surface area if you

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:03.590 
of all the excess surface area if you
can<00:00:59.970> get<00:01:00.090> up<00:01:00.180> to<00:01:00.210> number<00:01:00.510> 13<00:01:01.079> efficiency<00:01:02.600> we're

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
can get up to number 13 efficiency we're

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:05.660 
can get up to number 13 efficiency we're
exchanging<00:01:04.140> a<00:01:04.320> one<00:01:04.619> inch<00:01:04.799> flat<00:01:04.949> panel<00:01:05.369> filter

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 
exchanging a one inch flat panel filter

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:07.940 
exchanging a one inch flat panel filter
with<00:01:05.939> the<00:01:06.030> return<00:01:06.390> air<00:01:06.630> grill<00:01:06.900> filter<00:01:07.320> it's

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950 
with the return air grill filter it's

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:14.520 
with the return air grill filter it's
quite<00:01:08.220> simple

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:14.530 

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:16.990 

they<00:01:15.530> got<00:01:15.710> your<00:01:15.829> one<00:01:15.979> inch<00:01:16.130> flat<00:01:16.250> panel<00:01:16.670> filter

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:17.000 
they got your one inch flat panel filter

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:22.929 
they got your one inch flat panel filter
so<00:01:17.719> this<00:01:17.899> thing<00:01:18.109> what<00:01:21.039> use<00:01:22.039> the<00:01:22.219> depth<00:01:22.460> behind

00:01:22.929 --> 00:01:22.939 
so this thing what use the depth behind

00:01:22.939 --> 00:01:27.849 
so this thing what use the depth behind
the<00:01:23.390> grill<00:01:23.710> to<00:01:24.710> extend<00:01:25.009> the<00:01:25.100> filter<00:01:26.679> make<00:01:27.679> sure

00:01:27.849 --> 00:01:27.859 
the grill to extend the filter make sure

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:31.240 
the grill to extend the filter make sure
