00:00:00.439 --> 00:00:09.240
 continue to knit a new row as you can see 

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:10.230
 bella thread here we have it 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:12.809
 ended up 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:14.089
 so we start from this place if 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:18.750
 you are not. 

00:00:14.089 --> 00:00:20.970
 ended at the end our ranks then 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:25.350
 start in the opposite direction knit 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:27.480
 a series of differences in this is no so 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:30.650
 recall the next row after the salad 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:30.650
 we are going white 

00:00:32.899 --> 00:00:38.360
 make our first loop 

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:47.690
 here and knit the same columns without nakida 

00:00:44.239 --> 00:00:47.690
 behind both walls 

00:00:53.920 --> 00:01:06.659
 we knit so up to our little flower up 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:06.659
 the beginnings of our leaves here we tied up and 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:19.659
 now look don our beginning 

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:24.280
 first leaf and now we are our leaf 

00:01:19.659 --> 00:01:28.770
 turn down like that with your finger and behind it 

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:39.840
 knit 2 air loops 1 2 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:43.030
 knit further we get the hook for 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:47.110
 in the loop next have a look we have 

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:49.899
 the loop in which we have knitted 

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:52.119
 leaves lay down another leaf 

00:01:49.899 --> 00:01:52.750
 see on the loop and now we kopchuk 

00:01:52.119 --> 00:01:58.359
 we get 

00:01:52.750 --> 00:02:03.460
 our next loop and knit 

00:01:58.359 --> 00:02:10.720
 single crochet behind both walls and also 

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:15.850
 dopevyazyvaem to the next flower still 

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:21.900
 time I will explain why we do 2 air 

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:26.350
 loops for our flower because we 

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:29.079
 when we knit miss exactly two 

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:32.290
 Loops 2 columns to skip look 

00:02:29.079 --> 00:02:34.930
 some but posts 1 1 loop we 

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:38.459
 miss this is the loop in which us 

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:46.460
 connected leaves and stalk here it is a loop 

00:02:38.459 --> 00:02:51.620
 so I hope so here our loop 

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:53.810
 and skip the loop in front of this loop of 

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:57.020
 which we begin to grow 

00:02:53.810 --> 00:03:00.880
 here is the first leaf to win and we are one 

00:02:57.020 --> 00:03:05.720
 loop and skip the loop in which 

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:06.830
 rule on our leaves that is, we are now 

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:12.890
 tied up 

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:14.900
 we essentially have one more and one more 

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:17.870
 a loop because you can knit but we do not 

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:20.120
 provyazyvayem same skip this one 

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:23.660
 the loop is therefore following 2 

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:31.730
 loops knit 2 air loops instead 

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:37.870
 and we knit the next loop 

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:37.870
 Our posts are no crochets 

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:47.200
 everything is logical we skip 2 loops and 

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:47.200
 instead we knit 2 air loops 

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:56.730
 again here it is more visible show here we are 

00:03:54.010 --> 00:04:00.400
 Now tied our posts without nakida 

00:03:56.730 --> 00:04:05.950
 here we have another loop in which 

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:09.760
 You can knit 1 column here from this 

00:04:05.950 --> 00:04:12.220
 loops we grow our leaf to 1 weighs 

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:14.500
 start us with this loop and here 

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:17.829
 the loop on the right is also not provyazyvaem 

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:20.769
 here is one loop we do not knit the second 

00:04:17.829 --> 00:04:23.890
 the loop we do not provyazhivat to look in which 

00:04:20.769 --> 00:04:31.450
 we have our leaves stalks and knit immediately 

00:04:23.890 --> 00:04:34.500
 here in this loop the next one two two 

00:04:31.450 --> 00:04:41.860
 air loops and knit 

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:44.400
 next loop here look at us 

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:44.400
 it turns out 

00:04:49.630 --> 00:04:56.500
 if something is not clear you must 

00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:59.970
 ask in the comments under the video i 

00:04:56.500 --> 00:04:59.970
 I will explain to you 

00:05:04.810 --> 00:05:15.010
 Yes, the helmet of our little flower again 

00:05:07.690 --> 00:05:17.669
 knit two air loops and dovevyazyvaya 

00:05:15.010 --> 00:05:17.669
 our tee. 

00:05:20.340 --> 00:05:27.250
 flies. 

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:29.130
 a row here we finished our row doing one 

00:05:27.250 --> 00:05:35.650
 air loop for lifting 

00:05:29.130 --> 00:05:42.990
 unfold our pattern and knit in 

00:05:35.650 --> 00:05:46.900
 reverse order new row 

00:05:42.990 --> 00:05:49.120
 the wrong side of our pattern 

00:05:46.900 --> 00:05:53.500
 have a look here I finished the conversation 

00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:56.200
 our air loops here through 

00:05:53.500 --> 00:06:02.500
 air loops we knit 2 

00:05:56.200 --> 00:06:04.900
 nakida column and continue to continue 

00:06:02.500 --> 00:06:12.490
 knit with the principle is also nothing complicated 

00:06:04.900 --> 00:06:16.870
 we just knit through our 

00:06:12.490 --> 00:06:18.910
 air loops 2 single crochet 2 

00:06:16.870 --> 00:06:23.350
 air loops 2 single crochet 

00:06:18.910 --> 00:06:25.830
 everything is also logical and everything is just 

00:06:23.350 --> 00:06:35.289
 again I put air loops 

00:06:25.830 --> 00:06:37.750
 knit 1 2 threads and knit further to 

00:06:35.289 --> 00:06:43.090
 the end will not show how to knit with 

00:06:37.750 --> 00:06:46.630
 Basically, here we have a look. 

00:06:43.090 --> 00:06:49.450
 knit now 11 knit knit 

00:06:46.630 --> 00:06:52.900
 second row of white strings of such rows but 

00:06:49.450 --> 00:06:53.440
 must be 5 i'm on my own now 

00:06:52.900 --> 00:06:56.289
 knit 

00:06:53.440 --> 00:07:01.320
 you also knit and meet when we 

00:06:56.289 --> 00:07:01.320
 we trust with you 5 rows of white threads
