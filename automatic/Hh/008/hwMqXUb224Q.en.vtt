00:00:28.030 --> 00:00:33.140
 this work is a pleasure really 

00:00:31.190 --> 00:00:36.110
 I find in one of the best places 

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:38.840
 that I visited today I find in santa 

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:41.150
 olalla in this house absolutely of 

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:42.980
 wood today we are going to talk to the 

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:45.020
 architect will be seeing that we will 

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:48.070
 tell more details of this spectacular 

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:48.070
 let's see her 

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:58.079
 ah 

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:12.010
 Julian, how were you and how are you? 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:14.740
 quite really marveled by this 

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:16.330
 absolutely good house this 

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:18.160
 it's a house as you say it's totally from 

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:21.250
 wood is made of wood 

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:23.170
 recycled and with wood from own 

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:24.640
 of forests customer own the 

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:27.250
 Reform that wood is product is pure 

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:30.130
 pilot and we 're going through the side 

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:32.610
 let's say that this is the social environment 

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:36.000
 you do not have a dining room 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:40.479
 the kitchen almost a double height one month 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:44.450
 upwards the kitchen environment 

00:01:40.479 --> 00:01:46.909
 It is a small but open kitchen 

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:49.969
 let's say it's home is a kitchen &amp; it's 

00:01:46.909 --> 00:01:51.350
 a cliche net with a black granite all 

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:53.600
 what are you seeing here the greatest 

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:55.340
 recycled one comes back and here we have a 

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:57.079
 Attic, what was used was the 

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:59.030
 space also to give you another area 

00:01:57.079 --> 00:02:01.130
 so he wasted no time in the house of 

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:05.530
 the height for let's say to win a 

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:05.530
 space more to the room we do not go let's go 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:14.220
 this step was won let's say we have a 

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:15.720
 quite large height was seized it 

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:17.610
 put the mezzanine on fire like a 

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:20.580
 expansion of the room and now this 

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:23.070
 small small room also as if the 

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:26.330
 the wide roof does not remind us 

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:26.330
 the old houses but gigas 

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:40.380
 I think the floor was the same 

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:42.870
 house itself but it tells me it's this halo 

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:44.910
 the floor 100 new a pastelÃ³n that 

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:47.130
 commanded to make these stones are the 

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:49.260
 same stones of this close with the 

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:51.480
 granite from the hill had to cut the 

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:54.030
 Vogel hill to create this terrace for 

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:55.920
 than to generate those heights even in 

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:58.230
 the room you have two terraces a terrace 

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:59.970
 there is the right side 

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:01.890
 let's say it is that it communicates the part of 

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:04.110
 the grill we do not have a little stove anymore 

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:05.880
 there later and we also have a 

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:07.140
 another terrace that is served we arrived for 

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:10.410
 take home there is one in the mornings because 

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:13.910
 is the sun the mornings let's say this 

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:13.910
 part is in enough shadow 

00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:26.800
 well, we keep going a bit 

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:26.800
 house is not in sight 

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:33.410
 that's how you'll see it 's finished this is 

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:37.450
 a match in black 'other than the one 

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:37.450
 we have outside that now would happen to 

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:48.140
 a splendid height wood for all 

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:49.100
 sides the floor rooms if you realize 

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:58.940
 we are above the 

00:03:49.100 --> 00:04:01.010
 parking lot and we have the bathroom to the 

00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:04.400
 left side we do not have the damage with a 

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:06.200
 bathroom let's say almost integrated the part the 

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:09.950
 bedroom we continue with the theme of the 

00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:17.109
 wood finish if we change God 

00:04:09.950 --> 00:04:21.099
 to contact the wood a bit with him 

00:04:17.109 --> 00:04:23.289
 if this is the lavatory board 

00:04:21.099 --> 00:04:24.610
 let's say in wood is also equal to 

00:04:23.289 --> 00:04:26.830
 same pine wood but in another color 

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:28.300
 something important very well that we have not 

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:32.139
 talked a lot about the subject of lighting 

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:34.360
 that everywhere is present 

00:04:32.139 --> 00:04:36.490
 that's right, that's indirect lighting 

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:38.620
 that is facing the ceiling is 

00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:40.180
 illuminates the beams and there the light bounces 

00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:42.219
 towards another important detail are the 

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:44.080
 chairs perhaps because it takes the subject to 

00:04:42.219 --> 00:04:45.849
 put the glass like this is a coasters 

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:47.409
 necessary if you have sat on the 

00:04:45.849 --> 00:04:49.210
 terrace is always game with a 

00:04:47.409 --> 00:04:51.759
 swallow with a glass of water is a 

00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:53.590
 sight we almost reached 200 degrees that 

00:04:51.759 --> 00:04:56.560
 almost east of the valley of santa eulalia 

00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:58.360
 you have a view to the left facing 

00:04:56.560 --> 00:04:59.740
 the right hand we have a cataract that 

00:04:58.360 --> 00:05:01.629
 It was also made especially for the 

00:04:59.740 --> 00:05:03.400
 home we know that the sound of 

00:05:01.629 --> 00:05:06.460
 water is always blonde and if in the 

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:09.310
 night in the day you are listening to the 

00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:11.729
 water street we are on top of 

00:05:09.310 --> 00:05:11.729
 parking lot 

00:05:12.310 --> 00:05:16.060
 this is the parking lot was made 

00:05:13.689 --> 00:05:17.770
 let's say to put them the floats that 

00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:19.509
 It has the owner but it has some cars 

00:05:17.770 --> 00:05:20.950
 old collections that will put it 

00:05:19.509 --> 00:05:24.100
 there running puzzle 

00:05:20.950 --> 00:05:25.900
 a pleasure an honor to be in this house of 

00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:28.380
 spectacular way with this view 

00:05:25.900 --> 00:05:31.360
 sensational 

00:05:28.380 --> 00:05:34.060
 really sensational if you want 

00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:36.850
 call grandfather the phones appear 

00:05:34.060 --> 00:05:39.180
 on the screen we continue with more life and 

00:05:36.850 --> 00:05:42.180
 home while I enjoy this house 

00:05:39.180 --> 00:05:42.180
 formidable 

00:05:44.569 --> 00:05:47.080
