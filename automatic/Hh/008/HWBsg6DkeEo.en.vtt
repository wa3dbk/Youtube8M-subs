00:00:03.820 --> 00:00:08.590
 hello today i will show you a new recipe 

00:00:06.759 --> 00:00:10.780
 this is apple pie 

00:00:08.590 --> 00:00:13.959
 but the most interesting feature of this 

00:00:10.780 --> 00:00:15.519
 pie is that based on this dough 

00:00:13.959 --> 00:00:18.369
 you can make a cake 

00:00:15.519 --> 00:00:20.590
 absolutely any filling even a little bit 

00:00:18.369 --> 00:00:23.949
 you reduce the amount of sugar in the dough 

00:00:20.590 --> 00:00:27.490
 pie can be made with any 

00:00:23.949 --> 00:00:30.310
 fish cottage cheese filling with vegetables or 

00:00:27.490 --> 00:00:32.980
 any other that you like and so for 

00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:35.489
 of this pie you will need 3 glasses 

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:38.440
 flour 1 egg 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:41.770
 apples I think somewhere around a kilogram 

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:45.129
 apples need half a glass of kefir floor 

00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:47.920
 cups of sugar and most importantly, too, HIV 

00:00:45.129 --> 00:00:52.140
 baking powder cinnamon clove and also 

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:52.140
 my taste is a pack of butter 200 grams 

00:00:56.200 --> 00:01:05.230
 for a start I propose to do apples and 

00:00:58.380 --> 00:01:08.160
 so we clean the apples from them chips 

00:01:05.230 --> 00:01:08.160
 in the usual way 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:27.640
 core all tasteless parts 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:28.990
 I do like this when I like apples 

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:33.550
 large cubes 

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:37.320
 I prepared so many apples by the way 

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:40.630
 you can add raisins to taste and 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:43.300
 find out cherry varnish anything you want 

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:45.790
 I like to do the preparation test I 

00:01:43.300 --> 00:02:00.280
 measured out 3 cups of flour and now I will 

00:01:45.790 --> 00:02:03.580
 sift it I sifted flour now 

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:07.569
 flour need to add butter but 

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:11.830
 butter can be ground with flour 

00:02:07.569 --> 00:02:14.970
 or combine harvester hands can 

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:18.100
 do this if you have a nozzle knife 

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:21.670
 if you have no can war butter can 

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:25.540
 just cut into cubes or you can 

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:28.330
 chill in the freezer and then rub on 

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:32.069
 grater then it will be much easier for you 

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:32.069
 grind flour much faster 

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:42.390
 I rubbed 

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:45.690
 200 grams of chilled butter 

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:48.300
 I got a whole hill of oil 

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:51.000
 flakes now need to quickly connect 

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:53.660
 chilled butter with flour and grind 

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.660
 his hands 

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:12.760
 I rubbed the flour with butter turned out 

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:15.930
 Here is a mug of flour to flour, I think 

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:19.810
 one egg is half a glass of sugar and 

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:21.790
 15 grams of baking powder as well from you I 

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:29.489
 add a pinch 

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:29.489
 carnations I her in front of about the assignment and here 

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:51.310
 ready now neatly with a spoon 

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:51.310
 mix and add half a cup of kefir 

00:03:56.900 --> 00:04:06.829
 begin to knead continue 

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:10.939
 I knead my hands with you 

00:04:06.829 --> 00:04:14.750
 soft dough I now divide it into 

00:04:10.939 --> 00:04:18.049
 unequal parts one big part of me 

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:23.330
 go to the bottom of the form a small part 

00:04:18.049 --> 00:04:25.539
 will go to the top as the cap will be so 

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:28.539
 Now 

00:04:25.539 --> 00:04:30.530
 table flour 

00:04:28.539 --> 00:04:38.720
 we take the most part 

00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:41.150
 and roll it such a circle because 

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:44.060
 I will use this round 

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:46.639
 form keep in mind that the cake will be 

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:51.949
 tall therefore the shape should be 

00:04:46.639 --> 00:04:54.970
 deep or take a larger one 

00:04:51.949 --> 00:04:57.500
 rolling pin and start rolling dough 

00:04:54.970 --> 00:05:02.650
 shape grease creamy or 

00:04:57.500 --> 00:05:02.650
 spread the dough with vegetable oil 

00:05:08.370 --> 00:05:18.770
 the dough is already very soft butter heated 

00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:18.770
 we will spread apples here 

00:05:27.110 --> 00:05:51.720
 do a small side now need 

00:05:51.060 --> 00:05:56.310
 to sprinkle 

00:05:51.720 --> 00:06:02.090
 sugar apples do to taste I think that 

00:05:56.310 --> 00:06:02.090
 4 tablespoons of sugar is enough for me 

00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:08.150
 i also add cinnamon to apples 

00:06:09.740 --> 00:06:26.670

00:07:01.760 --> 00:07:06.250
 also in time should also be observed 

00:07:03.650 --> 00:07:09.160

00:07:06.250 --> 00:07:12.790
