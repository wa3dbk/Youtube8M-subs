00:00:01.250 --> 00:00:04.700
 mathematics thematic axis in numbers and 

00:00:03.860 --> 00:00:06.620
 proportionality 

00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:09.160
 We'll see how to break down a number into 

00:00:06.620 --> 00:00:11.110
 powers of 10 

00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:13.719
 The first thing we must remember is that 

00:00:11.110 --> 00:00:15.850
 is a power of 10 a power of 10 

00:00:13.719 --> 00:00:18.040
 is a number of the form 10 raised an 

00:00:15.850 --> 00:00:20.830
 which corresponds to the number 10 multiple and 

00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:25.000
 I do it myself n times by definition 

00:00:20.830 --> 00:00:28.320
 10 raised to 0 is worth 1 10 to 1 is equal 

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:32.830
 to 10 10 raised to 12 10 by 10 or 100 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:35.710
 10 raised to 13 10 x 10 x 10 be thousand 10 

00:00:32.830 --> 00:00:38.430
 raised 4 is 10,000 19 25 is 100,000 

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:38.430
 etc 

00:00:39.130 --> 00:00:43.000
 now to decompose a number into 

00:00:40.990 --> 00:00:45.160
 power of 10 then means 

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:47.350
 write it as a sum of powers of 

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:48.930
 10 for this we must first 

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:51.400
 decompose it in the following way 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:53.380
 we must separate it as a sum the 

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:55.300
 tens of thousands plus the 1000 units 

00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:56.360
 plus the hundreds plus the tens plus the 

00:00:55.300 --> 00:01:01.160
 units 

00:00:56.360 --> 00:01:06.230
 for example 13,456 equals 10,000 

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:09.140
 plus 3 thousand 450 plus 6 is the first step 

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:10.940
 to decompose into powers 

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:13.159
 once we have done that 

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:14.990
 decomposition we have to write each 

00:01:13.159 --> 00:01:16.930
 one of those numbers multiples of one 

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:19.330
 power of 10 

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:24.460
 for example 10,000 is one per 10,000 

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:30.320
 the 3000 is 3 per thousand 400 64 percent 

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:31.940
 55 by 10 and 66 by 1 

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:33.740
 once done this second 

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:35.750
 decomposition then we have to 

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:39.020
 write each multiple of 10 as 

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:40.880
 powers of days then one by 

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:42.980
 10,000 let's write the 10,000 as 

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:46.560
 10 high 4 

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:50.880
 three times a thousand is 3 times 10 raised to 3 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:54.630
 4% is 4 times 10 raised to 2 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:57.360
 5 times 10 5 times 10 and 6 times 16 times a day is 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:59.220
 raised to 0 there the number is already 

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:00.700
 decomposed as a sum of powers 

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:02.619
 from 10 

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:09.929
 let's make an example of xcom let's put the 

00:02:02.619 --> 00:02:13.120
 2300 12 thousand 301 equals 2300 

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:16.860
 + 1 

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:19.680
 that is to say that is two per thousand 

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:23.180
 + 3% 

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:23.180
 more one by one 

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:30.750
 we write as a power of 10 2 for the 

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:35.819
 thousands 10 was raised to 3 + 3 by the 100 

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:39.260
 is 10 raised to 2 plus 1 to 1 is 10 

00:02:35.819 --> 00:02:39.260
 raised to 0 

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:44.380
 there are three compound the number as 

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:44.380
 power of 10
