00:00:08.489 --> 00:00:13.849
 do not want to be a fruitful native species from the south of Brazil 

00:00:13.849 --> 00:00:19.169
 height of this tree can reach 12 meters but only two years 

00:00:19.169 --> 00:00:22.169
 small ones can already produce good fruit 

00:00:26.839 --> 00:00:30.699
 the best known of bpms has a red coloration 

00:00:30.699 --> 00:00:34.070
 however there are others arises more insecure 

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:37.070
 one like this 

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:42.370
 a scandal the cultivation of the plant is still little explored in the region compared 

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:44.170
 to other cultivars 

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:50.240
 to encourage the production of methane in the temperate climate embrapa 

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:53.240
 developing research with some species 

00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:57.570
 initially a 100% conservation 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:00:58.580
 from the left 

00:00:58.580 --> 00:01:05.060
 but doing collection in various locations of different tiger plants. 

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:07.490
 charity ceac brings different 

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:12.210
 she is selecting then the best prar types to be later 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:14.320
 incorporated into the system of 

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:15.180
 protection 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:16.350
 in the region 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:20.229
 is the parallel to this are also being known tabÃ¡rez not only of 

00:01:20.229 --> 00:01:23.140
 characterization or must to the type of 

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:27.370
 give fruit and coloring film saving coloring 

00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:29.180
 it's fruit size 

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:33.190
 the chaos of being so characteristic was logic cider 

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:34.260
 name is 

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:35.410
 and also 

00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:38.300
 is being done in partnership with 

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:42.340
 other institutions in the case the federal university of pellets and when 

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:44.780
 they afternoon federal river great south 

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:48.990
 work towards the Haitian faithful with use of the use of these fruits 

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:52.980
 as well as human nutraceutical 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:55.570
 the idea 

00:01:55.570 --> 00:02:01.320
 is to evaluate the fruit utilization as well as the market viability with the 

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:06.040
 purpose of awakening the interest of the rural producer in cultivating the 

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:10.659
 I think this market has to have a 

00:02:10.659 --> 00:02:13.689
 the knowledge of how to use it not only 

00:02:13.689 --> 00:02:18.180
 is future renan promise because it is the rather perishable fruit but also 

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:20.209
 for processing in the case 

00:02:20.209 --> 00:02:23.650
 the environment is what we are trying to do to see those that are more 

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:26.650
 that you can 

00:02:29.119 --> 00:02:32.589
 so now we already have some selections we are already aware of 

00:02:32.589 --> 00:02:36.539
 louis 105 a little over ten selections 

00:02:37.199 --> 00:02:40.889
 and then some of those that stood out will start to be 

00:02:40.889 --> 00:02:41.889
 propagated 

00:02:41.889 --> 00:02:43.620
 the section was also discharged 

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:46.939
 which are uniform plants 

00:02:46.939 --> 00:02:50.159
 from there it can be made available to interested producers 

00:02:52.349 --> 00:02:55.939
 do not feel pitanguy pain considered rather short 

00:02:55.939 --> 00:03:00.929
 are about 30 days from the beginning of flowering to maturity of the fruit 

00:03:03.829 --> 00:03:08.969
 with embrapa has been working with two different woven varieties 

00:03:10.879 --> 00:03:14.599
 but one was collected in the four newspapers in the wild states 

00:03:14.599 --> 00:03:16.269
 and this wing has the command 

00:03:16.269 --> 00:03:19.609
 maturation season that followed in November, October and November 

00:03:20.249 --> 00:03:23.249
 but this one we have here that was collected like this 

00:03:23.829 --> 00:03:28.849
 parts of residences and private schools and that has existed for more than 40 years 

00:03:28.849 --> 00:03:31.049
 knew the origin 

00:03:31.049 --> 00:03:34.290
 these have two periods of fruit production or one 

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:37.190
 it would be great and November the net is a trick 

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:40.129
 then the new flowering begins from 

00:03:40.129 --> 00:03:43.819
 February begins to mature again and again until the arrival of the cold 

00:03:45.489 --> 00:03:46.500
 supported in the match 

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:50.109
 ownership - care of production is very simple 

00:03:50.109 --> 00:03:53.739
 bush well cared for there are no major problems with pests and diseases 

00:03:55.329 --> 00:03:58.729
 basically until the present we have not had any 

00:03:58.729 --> 00:04:03.329
 problem said that most important insect maybe even because 

00:04:03.329 --> 00:04:07.689
 does not exist is a very high population does not exist in commercial orchards 

00:04:07.689 --> 00:04:11.139
 with her then disease inoculum and said treki 

00:04:12.019 --> 00:04:15.639
 What you can actually notice is the incidence of fruit fly that attacks 

00:04:15.639 --> 00:04:18.150
 practically all the fruits of the region 

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:21.190
 but the interesting thing is that usually the store is expanded 

00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:22.570
 in front of the canoes 31 

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:24.559
 practically no problem 

00:04:24.559 --> 00:04:27.129
 from the point of view of dove teaching 

00:04:27.129 --> 00:04:32.080
 Some other problems have been noted, such as iron, more sporadic today. 

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:33.259
 plantation 

00:04:33.259 --> 00:04:37.590
 tarik also insects that attack with the revelry in the new plants causing 

00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:41.470
 so gutters in the focus on the leaves in the saws are things out of 

00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:42.550
 are 

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:47.330
 controlled without fear only with a withdrawal of cancer in mine are Joseph in the 

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:50.099
 attacked or care would be wise 

00:04:50.099 --> 00:04:53.349
 basically the cleaning of land fertilization 

00:04:53.349 --> 00:04:54.659
 ef 

00:04:54.659 --> 00:04:59.050
 the part was connected when you have a prolonged drought as it was this year 

00:04:59.969 --> 00:05:01.629
 I've been picked 

00:05:01.629 --> 00:05:03.409
 good fruits here 

00:05:03.409 --> 00:05:05.650
 yes we have will be related 

00:05:05.650 --> 00:05:08.340
 beyond the size and clear quality 

00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:11.379
 variability from one to another not only 

00:05:11.379 --> 00:05:13.610
 9 on the rope 

00:05:13.610 --> 00:05:17.330
 of fruit as well as attenuates ducati plant growth 

00:05:17.330 --> 00:05:20.330
 manaus am has insisted that 

00:05:22.159 --> 00:05:23.950
 larger than very large 

00:05:23.950 --> 00:05:28.160
 are 4 grams there are 5 grams fourth to 8 grams 

00:05:28.879 --> 00:05:30.110
 it's the post-harvest 

00:05:30.110 --> 00:05:34.770
 in some schools what is produced of saw life the most productive brands 

00:05:34.770 --> 00:05:37.770
 has been around 20 kilos per plant 

00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:43.129
 when adult of the pitanguinha can extract several products 

00:05:43.129 --> 00:05:46.560
 including how some news are already being tried 

00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:50.430
 is the aptn beyond worship 

00:05:50.430 --> 00:05:54.560
 consume nature it can be used for pulp mills 

00:05:54.560 --> 00:05:55.369
 savings 

00:05:55.369 --> 00:06:01.289
 can be used for both juice and milk 

00:06:01.289 --> 00:06:02.749
 local experiences 

00:06:02.749 --> 00:06:06.949
 nope I already did the box was made with Nikkei the city that was made and I smelled 

00:06:06.949 --> 00:06:09.949
 here as very good 

00:06:13.339 --> 00:06:16.089
 a small industry has also become a 

00:06:16.089 --> 00:06:20.259
 in a spell serum experience that was very well accepted, says me 

00:06:20.259 --> 00:06:21.809
 I ask you what causes 

00:06:21.809 --> 00:06:24.839
 because I tasted characteristic and and differently 

00:06:25.550 --> 00:06:28.550
 because we normally eat 

00:06:32.580 --> 00:06:36.080
 but on board differentiated the production 

00:06:36.080 --> 00:06:40.389
 and postponement of the market are sound principles for the culture of 

00:06:40.389 --> 00:06:45.280
 pitanga continue to grow in the region attracting more and more investors 

00:06:45.280 --> 00:06:48.360
 making it more popular 

00:06:48.360 --> 00:06:51.360
 juno of this native fruit of the south 

00:07:07.249 --> 00:07:11.289
 Product vuk
