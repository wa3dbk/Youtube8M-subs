options let me give you a couple of

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:12.740 
options let me give you a couple of
things<00:00:09.510> to<00:00:09.630> keep<00:00:09.750> in<00:00:09.929> mind<00:00:11.389> let's<00:00:12.389> start<00:00:12.630> with

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:12.750 
things to keep in mind let's start with

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:15.079 
things to keep in mind let's start with
the<00:00:12.840> definition<00:00:13.349> of<00:00:13.410> sharpening<00:00:13.920> now<00:00:14.910> there

00:00:15.079 --> 00:00:15.089 
the definition of sharpening now there

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:17.930 
the definition of sharpening now there
is<00:00:15.299> no<00:00:15.690> end<00:00:15.990> to<00:00:16.289> the<00:00:16.500> amount<00:00:16.680> of<00:00:16.859> ink<00:00:17.100> or<00:00:17.430> pixels

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:17.940 
is no end to the amount of ink or pixels

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:19.779 
is no end to the amount of ink or pixels
that<00:00:18.090> have<00:00:18.330> been<00:00:18.480> written<00:00:18.720> to<00:00:18.840> describe

00:00:19.779 --> 00:00:19.789 
that have been written to describe

00:00:19.789 --> 00:00:22.580 
that have been written to describe
sharpening<00:00:20.789> what<00:00:21.240> it<00:00:21.359> is<00:00:21.539> how<00:00:21.900> it<00:00:21.930> works<00:00:22.350> the

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:22.590 
sharpening what it is how it works the

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:25.580 
sharpening what it is how it works the
methods<00:00:23.220> all<00:00:23.400> that<00:00:23.580> stuff<00:00:24.170> but<00:00:25.170> let's<00:00:25.410> just

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:25.590 
methods all that stuff but let's just

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:29.570 
methods all that stuff but let's just
define<00:00:25.800> it<00:00:26.250> this<00:00:26.910> way<00:00:27.949> sharpening<00:00:28.949> is<00:00:29.160> taking

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:29.580 
define it this way sharpening is taking

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:31.939 
define it this way sharpening is taking
two<00:00:29.849> sides<00:00:30.179> of<00:00:30.510> a<00:00:30.630> knife<00:00:30.840> edge<00:00:31.080> and<00:00:31.410> bringing

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:31.949 
two sides of a knife edge and bringing

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:35.990 
two sides of a knife edge and bringing
them<00:00:32.099> together<00:00:33.739> that's<00:00:34.739> it<00:00:34.980> and<00:00:35.550> when<00:00:35.880> they

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:36.000 
them together that's it and when they

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.780 
them together that's it and when they
come<00:00:36.180> together<00:00:36.360> like<00:00:36.690> that<00:00:36.860> they<00:00:37.860> can<00:00:38.160> cut

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:38.790 
come together like that they can cut

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:40.610 
come together like that they can cut
stuff<00:00:39.090> they're<00:00:39.360> sharp<00:00:39.660> and<00:00:39.899> it<00:00:40.320> doesn't

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
stuff they're sharp and it doesn't

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:43.100 
stuff they're sharp and it doesn't
matter<00:00:40.770> for<00:00:41.520> our<00:00:41.579> definition<00:00:42.329> how<00:00:42.540> these<00:00:42.750> two

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:43.110 
matter for our definition how these two

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:46.160 
matter for our definition how these two
edges<00:00:43.350> come<00:00:43.770> together<00:00:44.719> the<00:00:45.719> only<00:00:45.899> thing<00:00:46.050> that

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
edges come together the only thing that

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:47.779 
edges come together the only thing that
matters<00:00:46.410> is<00:00:46.620> that<00:00:46.649> when<00:00:47.010> those<00:00:47.190> two<00:00:47.460> edges

00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:47.789 
matters is that when those two edges

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:48.410 
matters is that when those two edges
come<00:00:48.000> together

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
come together

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:51.380 
come together
that's<00:00:49.200> what<00:00:49.559> sharp<00:00:49.829> is<00:00:50.120> now<00:00:51.120> there<00:00:51.300> are<00:00:51.360> a

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390 
that's what sharp is now there are a

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:53.450 
that's what sharp is now there are a
million<00:00:51.660> other<00:00:51.930> factors<00:00:52.649> that<00:00:52.680> determine<00:00:53.370> the

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460 
million other factors that determine the

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:55.490 
million other factors that determine the
efficiency<00:00:53.850> of<00:00:54.030> the<00:00:54.149> process<00:00:54.719> the<00:00:54.960> usefulness

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
efficiency of the process the usefulness

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:57.410 
efficiency of the process the usefulness
of<00:00:55.620> the<00:00:55.770> edge<00:00:55.920> whether<00:00:56.309> or<00:00:56.489> not<00:00:56.579> you<00:00:56.760> you've

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
of the edge whether or not you you've

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:59.240 
of the edge whether or not you you've
actually<00:00:57.629> damaged<00:00:58.260> the<00:00:58.379> edge<00:00:58.500> of<00:00:58.739> as<00:00:59.010> you've

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
actually damaged the edge of as you've

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:02.720 
actually damaged the edge of as you've
got<00:00:59.430> there<00:00:59.730> but<00:01:00.719> when<00:01:01.649> those<00:01:01.920> two<00:01:02.190> edges<00:01:02.520> come

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 
got there but when those two edges come

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:07.700 
got there but when those two edges come
together<00:01:02.899> like<00:01:03.899> that<00:01:03.960> it's<00:01:04.949> sharp<00:01:05.250> and<00:01:06.710> what

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
together like that it's sharp and what

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:10.840 
together like that it's sharp and what
is<00:01:07.799> sharp<00:01:08.070> enough<00:01:08.340> I<00:01:08.869> see<00:01:09.869> people<00:01:10.200> on<00:01:10.320> line

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:10.850 
is sharp enough I see people on line

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:15.560 
is sharp enough I see people on line
Whittle<00:01:11.850> hair<00:01:12.180> and<00:01:13.970> I've<00:01:14.970> never<00:01:15.330> actually

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
Whittle hair and I've never actually

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:18.190 
Whittle hair and I've never actually
myself<00:01:16.259> had<00:01:16.470> the<00:01:16.590> occasion<00:01:17.100> to<00:01:17.130> whittle<00:01:17.460> hair

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:18.200 
myself had the occasion to whittle hair

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:22.670 
myself had the occasion to whittle hair
usually<00:01:19.200> I<00:01:19.229> choose<00:01:19.560> a<00:01:19.590> stick<00:01:20.070> but<00:01:21.560> seriously

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680 
usually I choose a stick but seriously

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:24.770 
usually I choose a stick but seriously
sharp<00:01:23.100> enough<00:01:23.400> means<00:01:23.700> that<00:01:24.030> it's<00:01:24.180> efficient

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780 
sharp enough means that it's efficient

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:28.130 
sharp enough means that it's efficient
it<00:01:25.710> it<00:01:26.369> efficiently<00:01:26.909> cuts<00:01:27.240> what<00:01:27.570> you<00:01:27.720> need<00:01:27.990> it

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
it it efficiently cuts what you need it

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:31.700 
it it efficiently cuts what you need it
to<00:01:28.170> cut<00:01:28.500> so<00:01:29.430> if<00:01:29.700> you<00:01:29.820> strip<00:01:30.090> wire<00:01:30.390> you<00:01:31.350> need<00:01:31.500> one

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
to cut so if you strip wire you need one

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:33.890 
to cut so if you strip wire you need one
level<00:01:31.920> of<00:01:32.100> sharpness<00:01:32.520> and<00:01:32.759> it<00:01:32.880> and<00:01:33.090> that<00:01:33.119> level

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:33.900 
level of sharpness and it and that level

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:35.450 
level of sharpness and it and that level
of<00:01:33.960> sharpness<00:01:34.229> would<00:01:34.530> not<00:01:34.710> please<00:01:35.189> somebody

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 
of sharpness would not please somebody

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:37.969 
of sharpness would not please somebody
who<00:01:35.700> wants<00:01:35.939> to<00:01:36.090> say<00:01:36.320> shave<00:01:37.320> with<00:01:37.650> the<00:01:37.680> blade

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:37.979 
who wants to say shave with the blade

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:41.359 
who wants to say shave with the blade
now<00:01:38.549> how<00:01:38.670> does<00:01:38.729> that<00:01:38.909> matter<00:01:39.530> well<00:01:40.530> if<00:01:40.829> your

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:41.369 
now how does that matter well if your

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:43.639 
now how does that matter well if your
main<00:01:41.549> concern<00:01:42.000> is<00:01:42.210> having<00:01:42.509> a<00:01:42.810> knife<00:01:42.990> that<00:01:43.590> is

00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:43.649 
main concern is having a knife that is

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:45.950 
main concern is having a knife that is
sharp<00:01:44.100> then<00:01:44.579> your<00:01:44.759> options<00:01:45.240> for<00:01:45.479> a<00:01:45.509> sharpening

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960 
sharp then your options for a sharpening

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:48.800 
sharp then your options for a sharpening
system<00:01:46.170> are<00:01:46.560> wide<00:01:46.829> open<00:01:47.030> all<00:01:48.030> you<00:01:48.360> need<00:01:48.540> to<00:01:48.630> do

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:48.810 
system are wide open all you need to do

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:51.200 
system are wide open all you need to do
is<00:01:49.020> get<00:01:49.530> these<00:01:49.680> two<00:01:50.009> edges<00:01:50.520> to<00:01:50.759> come<00:01:50.970> together

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.210 
is get these two edges to come together

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:54.289 
is get these two edges to come together
that's<00:01:51.840> it<00:01:52.020> and<00:01:52.340> if<00:01:53.340> you're<00:01:53.490> able<00:01:53.670> to<00:01:53.820> hold<00:01:54.119> an

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:54.299 
that's it and if you're able to hold an

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:56.510 
that's it and if you're able to hold an
edge<00:01:54.450> and<00:01:54.840> you<00:01:55.350> have<00:01:55.500> the<00:01:55.680> patience<00:01:56.250> to<00:01:56.310> learn

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520 
edge and you have the patience to learn

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:57.950 
edge and you have the patience to learn
a<00:01:56.579> new<00:01:56.790> skill<00:01:56.939> then<00:01:57.240> you<00:01:57.270> can<00:01:57.540> sharpen<00:01:57.810> your

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:57.960 
a new skill then you can sharpen your

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:00.800 
a new skill then you can sharpen your
knives<00:01:58.229> with<00:01:58.590> any<00:01:58.829> abrasive<00:01:59.430> stone<00:01:59.810> diamond

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:00.810 
knives with any abrasive stone diamond

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:02.660 
knives with any abrasive stone diamond
ceramic<00:02:01.409> whatever<00:02:01.770> it<00:02:01.920> is<00:02:02.040> that<00:02:02.340> will<00:02:02.460> take

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:02.670 
ceramic whatever it is that will take
