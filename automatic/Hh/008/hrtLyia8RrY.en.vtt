00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
right times that are profitable over the

00:00:57.149 --> 00:00:59.360 
right times that are profitable over the
long<00:00:57.329> run<00:00:57.590> so<00:00:58.590> you'll<00:00:58.739> see<00:00:58.890> really<00:00:59.039> bad

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370 
long run so you'll see really bad

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:01.160

exploiting or bluffing or trying to make

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:04.789 
exploiting or bluffing or trying to make
steals<00:01:03.149> that'll<00:01:03.420> never<00:01:03.570> work<00:01:03.690> the<00:01:04.500> difference

00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:04.799 
steals that'll never work the difference

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:06.230 
steals that'll never work the difference
between<00:01:04.949> bad<00:01:05.220> players<00:01:05.519> and<00:01:05.670> great<00:01:05.760> players<00:01:06.090> is

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240 
between bad players and great players is

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:07.399 
between bad players and great players is
great<00:01:06.450> players<00:01:06.689> do<00:01:06.900> it<00:01:07.020> it<00:01:07.140> may<00:01:07.229> not<00:01:07.260> work

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
great players do it it may not work

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:09.410 
great players do it it may not work
right<00:01:07.770> then<00:01:08.070> and<00:01:08.220> there<00:01:08.280> but<00:01:08.670> over<00:01:09.180> the<00:01:09.270> long

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
right then and there but over the long

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:10.760 
right then and there but over the long
run<00:01:09.600> they<00:01:09.750> know<00:01:09.900> that<00:01:10.080> that<00:01:10.229> play<00:01:10.439> that<00:01:10.650> they

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
run they know that that play that they

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:13.190 
run they know that that play that they
make<00:01:11.010> will<00:01:11.189> work<00:01:11.430> so<00:01:12.180> the<00:01:12.510> example<00:01:12.930> is<00:01:13.020> like

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
make will work so the example is like

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:15.770 
make will work so the example is like
you<00:01:13.439> know<00:01:13.560> the<00:01:14.189> good<00:01:14.340> if<00:01:14.729> I<00:01:15.210> sit<00:01:15.420> down<00:01:15.509> with<00:01:15.570> one

the<00:01:33.000> table<00:01:33.299> that<00:01:33.390> maybe<00:01:33.810> the<00:01:33.990> player<00:01:34.200> you<00:01:34.740> know

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860 
the table that maybe the player you know

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:36.590 
the table that maybe the player you know
maybe<00:01:35.220> the<00:01:35.400> player<00:01:35.610> in<00:01:35.729> the<00:01:35.820> one<00:01:36.000> seat<00:01:36.270> is<00:01:36.420> the

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
maybe the player in the one seat is the

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:38.030 
maybe the player in the one seat is the
kind<00:01:36.810> of<00:01:36.900> player<00:01:37.079> who<00:01:37.259> likes<00:01:37.409> to<00:01:37.590> see<00:01:37.740> every

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
kind of player who likes to see every

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:40.310 
kind of player who likes to see every
single<00:01:38.220> flop<00:01:38.640> and<00:01:38.909> if<00:01:39.030> they<00:01:39.180> hit<00:01:39.420> they<00:01:39.990> stay<00:01:40.259> in

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320 
single flop and if they hit they stay in

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:42.530 
single flop and if they hit they stay in
and<00:01:40.619> if<00:01:40.710> they<00:01:40.860> don't<00:01:41.070> they<00:01:41.369> leave<00:01:41.610> so<00:01:42.299> this<00:01:42.420> is

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:42.540 
and if they don't they leave so this is

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:43.520 
and if they don't they leave so this is
the<00:01:42.630> kind<00:01:42.780> of<00:01:42.840> player<00:01:43.020> that<00:01:43.049> I'm<00:01:43.259> constantly

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530 
the kind of player that I'm constantly

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:46.190 
the kind of player that I'm constantly
in<00:01:43.829> pots<00:01:44.549> with<00:01:44.759> trying<00:01:45.060> to<00:01:45.149> you<00:01:45.329> know<00:01:45.450> I<00:01:45.750> can

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
in pots with trying to you know I can

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:47.719 
in pots with trying to you know I can
take<00:01:46.290> the<00:01:46.409> pot<00:01:46.590> down<00:01:46.770> like<00:01:46.979> 80%<00:01:47.220> of<00:01:47.490> the<00:01:47.579> time

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:47.729 
take the pot down like 80% of the time

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:50.090 
take the pot down like 80% of the time
and<00:01:48.060> if<00:01:48.420> they<00:01:48.750> don't<00:01:49.020> if<00:01:49.409> they<00:01:49.470> know<00:01:49.979> they

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100 
and if they don't if they know they

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:51.230 
and if they don't if they know they
stick<00:01:50.369> around<00:01:50.399> they<00:01:50.729> probably<00:01:51.119> have

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240 
stick around they probably have

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:52.670 
stick around they probably have
something<00:01:51.479> and<00:01:51.720> simple<00:01:51.990> things<00:01:52.200> like<00:01:52.409> that

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:52.680 
something and simple things like that

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:54.800 
something and simple things like that
that<00:01:53.130> you're<00:01:53.280> looking<00:01:53.640> for<00:01:53.850> or<00:01:54.360> things<00:01:54.630> where

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810 
that you're looking for or things where

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:56.660 
that you're looking for or things where
it's<00:01:54.960> like<00:01:55.110> you<00:01:55.200> know<00:01:55.259> it's<00:01:55.860> a<00:01:55.920> limp<00:01:56.130> call<00:01:56.399> call

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 
it's like you know it's a limp call call

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:58.429 
it's like you know it's a limp call call
call<00:01:56.700> and<00:01:57.149> you<00:01:57.240> know<00:01:57.270> that<00:01:57.540> raising<00:01:57.780> there<00:01:58.170> is

00:01:58.429 --> 00:01:58.439 
call and you know that raising there is

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:00.380 
call and you know that raising there is
going<00:01:58.770> to<00:01:58.829> take<00:01:59.070> down<00:01:59.250> is<00:01:59.549> getting<00:02:00.030> everybody

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:00.390 
going to take down is getting everybody

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:01.910 
going to take down is getting everybody
to<00:02:00.509> fold<00:02:00.750> like<00:02:00.990> 90<00:02:01.320> percent<00:02:01.409> of<00:02:01.649> the<00:02:01.740> time

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:01.920 
to fold like 90 percent of the time

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:03.560 
to fold like 90 percent of the time
because<00:02:02.100> the<00:02:02.310> players<00:02:02.549> just<00:02:02.790> limp<00:02:03.030> so<00:02:03.180> often

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:03.570 
because the players just limp so often

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:05.240 
because the players just limp so often
they<00:02:03.930> limb<00:02:04.110> foam<00:02:04.320> so<00:02:04.590> off<00:02:04.770> and<00:02:04.799> you<00:02:05.009> know<00:02:05.100> that

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:05.250 
they limb foam so off and you know that

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:06.679 
they limb foam so off and you know that
play<00:02:05.460> to<00:02:05.520> be<00:02:05.640> profitable<00:02:06.090> so<00:02:06.210> you<00:02:06.299> take<00:02:06.479> that

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:06.689 
play to be profitable so you take that

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:09.380 
play to be profitable so you take that
perspective<00:02:06.960> or<00:02:07.860> you<00:02:07.890> raise<00:02:08.610> that<00:02:09.149> that's

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:09.390 
perspective or you raise that that's

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:10.520 
perspective or you raise that that's
what<00:02:09.509> you<00:02:09.569> got<00:02:09.720> to<00:02:09.840> do<00:02:09.929> you<00:02:10.110> got<00:02:10.140> to<00:02:10.259> really

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:10.530 
what you got to do you got to really

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:12.290 
what you got to do you got to really
exploit<00:02:11.310> like<00:02:11.550> poker<00:02:11.790> is<00:02:11.940> all<00:02:12.090> about

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:12.300 
exploit like poker is all about

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:13.620 
exploit like poker is all about
exploitation<00:02:12.629> for<00:02:13.170> the

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:13.630 
exploitation for the

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:16.020 
exploitation for the
means<00:02:13.840> people<00:02:14.200> try<00:02:14.500> to<00:02:14.530> good<00:02:15.040> great<00:02:15.700> players

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:16.030 
means people try to good great players

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:17.520 
means people try to good great players
are<00:02:16.270> going<00:02:16.480> to<00:02:16.600> exploit<00:02:17.080> when<00:02:17.290> they<00:02:17.380> know

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:17.530 
are going to exploit when they know

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:19.230 
are going to exploit when they know
that's<00:02:17.740> profitable<00:02:18.250> over<00:02:18.640> the<00:02:18.730> long<00:02:19.000> run

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:19.240 
that's profitable over the long run

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:21.600 
that's profitable over the long run
we're<00:02:19.900> good<00:02:20.230> players<00:02:20.560> are<00:02:20.860> going<00:02:20.980> to<00:02:21.040> not

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:21.610 
we're good players are going to not

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:23.400 
we're good players are going to not
really<00:02:21.880> exploit<00:02:22.240> that<00:02:22.420> much<00:02:22.630> and<00:02:22.840> shitty

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:23.410 
really exploit that much and shitty

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:24.810 
really exploit that much and shitty
players<00:02:23.740> are<00:02:23.950> going<00:02:24.040> to<00:02:24.100> exploit<00:02:24.490> in<00:02:24.730> the

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:24.820 
players are going to exploit in the

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:25.500 
players are going to exploit in the
wrong<00:02:24.970> spot

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:25.510 
wrong spot

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:26.850 
wrong spot
so<00:02:25.600> they're<00:02:25.720> not<00:02:25.840> being<00:02:25.900> exploiting<00:02:26.710> they

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:26.860 
so they're not being exploiting they

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:28.320 
so they're not being exploiting they
were<00:02:26.920> usually<00:02:27.100> exploited<00:02:27.760> they're<00:02:27.880> not<00:02:28.120> being

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:28.330 
were usually exploited they're not being

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:29.790 
were usually exploited they're not being
then<00:02:28.660> I<00:02:28.720> exploiting<00:02:29.110> anyone<00:02:29.410> they're<00:02:29.560> usually

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:29.800 
then I exploiting anyone they're usually

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:31.680 
then I exploiting anyone they're usually
being<00:02:29.980> exploited<00:02:30.280> themselves<00:02:30.910> it's<00:02:31.480> very

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:31.690 
being exploited themselves it's very

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:33.330 
being exploited themselves it's very
very<00:02:31.960> interesting<00:02:32.470> how<00:02:32.590> you<00:02:32.920> know<00:02:33.040> the

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:33.340 
very interesting how you know the

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:34.770 
very interesting how you know the
different<00:02:33.730> dynamic<00:02:34.180> between<00:02:34.330> that<00:02:34.630> and

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:34.780 
different dynamic between that and

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:36.930 
different dynamic between that and
usually<00:02:34.960> you<00:02:35.230> see<00:02:35.410> growth<00:02:35.620> so<00:02:35.830> usually<00:02:36.160> what

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:36.940 
usually you see growth so usually what

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:38.190 
usually you see growth so usually what
usually<00:02:37.090> happens<00:02:37.540> players<00:02:37.780> come<00:02:37.990> in<00:02:38.110> they

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:38.200 
usually happens players come in they

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:39.450 
usually happens players come in they
have<00:02:38.230> no<00:02:38.410> idea<00:02:38.590> what<00:02:38.680> the<00:02:38.770> hell<00:02:38.950> they're<00:02:39.130> doing

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:39.460 
have no idea what the hell they're doing

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:40.980 
have no idea what the hell they're doing
right<00:02:39.640> so<00:02:39.700> they're<00:02:40.060> they're<00:02:40.510> you<00:02:40.870> know

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:40.990 
right so they're they're you know

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:42.810 
right so they're they're you know

raising they're bluffing it's tall

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:45.180 
raising they're bluffing it's tall
terrible<00:02:43.390> and<00:02:44.350> then<00:02:44.590> they<00:02:44.710> get<00:02:44.830> to<00:02:44.980> good

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:45.190 
terrible and then they get to good

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:47.460 
terrible and then they get to good

delicate<00:02:58.290> gradual<00:02:59.290> balance<00:02:59.650> and<00:02:59.770> a<00:02:59.830> good

00:02:59.970 --> 00:02:59.980 
delicate gradual balance and a good

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:01.800 
delicate gradual balance and a good
gradual<00:03:00.670> process<00:03:01.090> and<00:03:01.120> the<00:03:01.270> good<00:03:01.420> thing<00:03:01.570> to<00:03:01.600> do

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:01.810 
gradual process and the good thing to do

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:03.540 
gradual process and the good thing to do
is<00:03:01.960> really<00:03:02.470> think<00:03:02.560> about<00:03:02.770> where<00:03:03.130> you<00:03:03.280> are

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:03.550 
is really think about where you are

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:06.060 
is really think about where you are
along<00:03:03.880> this<00:03:04.150> scale<00:03:04.360> like<00:03:04.990> you<00:03:05.230> know<00:03:05.380> are<00:03:05.620> you

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:06.070 
along this scale like you know are you

00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:07.830 
along this scale like you know are you
the<00:03:06.100> kind<00:03:06.310> of<00:03:06.460> player<00:03:06.670> who's<00:03:06.970> is<00:03:07.270> saying<00:03:07.600> you

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:07.840 
the kind of player who's is saying you

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:09.480 
the kind of player who's is saying you
know<00:03:07.900> I<00:03:07.960> think<00:03:08.050> this<00:03:08.290> play<00:03:08.530> is<00:03:08.710> exploitable

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:09.490 
know I think this play is exploitable

00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:11.520 
know I think this play is exploitable
over<00:03:09.700> the<00:03:09.790> long<00:03:09.970> run<00:03:10.180> you<00:03:10.780> know<00:03:10.900> I'm<00:03:11.170> gonna<00:03:11.350> go

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:11.530 
over the long run you know I'm gonna go

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:13.170 
over the long run you know I'm gonna go
all-in<00:03:11.740> in<00:03:12.010> this<00:03:12.130> spot<00:03:12.400> because<00:03:12.580> I<00:03:12.760> think<00:03:13.030> that

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:13.180 
all-in in this spot because I think that

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:15.030 
all-in in this spot because I think that
my<00:03:13.300> opponent<00:03:13.750> folds<00:03:14.080> 70<00:03:14.440> or<00:03:14.530> 80<00:03:14.680> percent<00:03:15.010> of

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:15.040 
my opponent folds 70 or 80 percent of

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:16.680 
my opponent folds 70 or 80 percent of
the<00:03:15.130> time<00:03:15.340> and<00:03:15.550> if<00:03:15.610> they<00:03:15.730> have<00:03:15.910> aces<00:03:16.330> here<00:03:16.510> so

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:16.690 
the time and if they have aces here so

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:18.030 
the time and if they have aces here so
be<00:03:16.930> it<00:03:17.050> but<00:03:17.140> most<00:03:17.380> of<00:03:17.500> the<00:03:17.560> time<00:03:17.740> they<00:03:17.890> don't

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:18.040 
be it but most of the time they don't

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:20.250 
be it but most of the time they don't
most<00:03:18.400> the<00:03:18.490> time<00:03:18.670> I<00:03:18.700> pick<00:03:19.060> up<00:03:19.180> this<00:03:19.360> pot<00:03:19.570> and<00:03:19.840> I

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:20.260 
most the time I pick up this pot and I

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:22.290 
most the time I pick up this pot and I
know<00:03:20.320> this<00:03:20.590> play<00:03:20.800> is<00:03:20.860> plus<00:03:21.310> TV<00:03:21.520> and<00:03:21.880> blah<00:03:22.270> blah

00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:29.500 
like raised raised in a river raised all

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:31.620 
like raised raised in a river raised all
and<00:03:29.710> I<00:03:29.770> hope<00:03:29.920> you<00:03:30.040> folds<00:03:30.370> in<00:03:30.850> there<00:03:31.120> bad<00:03:31.360> player

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:31.630 
and I hope you folds in there bad player

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:34.770 
and I hope you folds in there bad player
probably<00:03:32.110> all<00:03:33.010> right<00:03:33.130> so<00:03:33.460> it<00:03:33.670> usually<00:03:34.270> for<00:03:34.690> the

00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:34.780 
probably all right so it usually for the

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:37.110 
probably all right so it usually for the
most<00:03:34.990> part<00:03:35.350> people<00:03:35.590> gravitate<00:03:36.280> you<00:03:36.610> don't<00:03:36.910> see

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:37.120 
most part people gravitate you don't see

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:38.130 
most part people gravitate you don't see
that<00:03:37.240> many<00:03:37.420> great<00:03:37.750> players

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:38.140 
that many great players

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:41.070 
that many great players
most<00:03:38.920> players<00:03:39.220> gravitate<00:03:40.060> between<00:03:40.450> good<00:03:40.810> and

00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:41.080 
most players gravitate between good and

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:42.990 
most players gravitate between good and
bad<00:03:41.370> they're<00:03:42.370> in<00:03:42.459> the<00:03:42.550> middle<00:03:42.790> right<00:03:42.940> there

00:03:42.990 --> 00:03:43.000 
bad they're in the middle right there

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.180 
bad they're in the middle right there
and<00:03:43.390> bringing<00:03:43.870> them<00:03:44.080> to<00:03:44.230> good<00:03:44.470> is<00:03:44.650> pretty<00:03:44.920> easy

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:45.190 
and bringing them to good is pretty easy

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:46.860 
and bringing them to good is pretty easy
but<00:03:45.490> bringing<00:03:45.700> them<00:03:45.820> to<00:03:46.000> great<00:03:46.330> takes<00:03:46.660> a<00:03:46.750> lot

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:46.870 
but bringing them to great takes a lot

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:49.260 
but bringing them to great takes a lot
more<00:03:46.900> time<00:03:47.320> so<00:03:48.100> that's<00:03:48.520> why<00:03:48.670> you'll<00:03:48.850> see<00:03:48.910> a<00:03:49.060> lot

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:49.270 
more time so that's why you'll see a lot

00:03:49.270 --> 00:03:51.270 
more time so that's why you'll see a lot
more<00:03:49.300> and<00:03:49.720> really<00:03:50.290> great<00:03:50.530> boils<00:03:51.070> down<00:03:51.100> to

00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:51.280 
more and really great boils down to

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:54.360 
more and really great boils down to
being<00:03:51.730> more<00:03:52.120> exploitive<00:03:52.750> on<00:03:52.930> post<00:03:53.410> post<00:03:54.160> flop

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:54.370 
being more exploitive on post post flop

00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:55.890 
being more exploitive on post post flop
everybody's<00:03:54.910> pretty<00:03:55.060> decent<00:03:55.600> preflop

00:03:55.890 --> 00:03:55.900 
everybody's pretty decent preflop

00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:57.600 
everybody's pretty decent preflop
everybody's<00:03:56.290> going<00:03:56.440> to<00:03:56.530> flop<00:03:56.770> most<00:03:57.400> of<00:03:57.550> the

00:03:57.600 --> 00:03:57.610 
everybody's going to flop most of the

00:03:57.610 --> 00:03:59.430 
everybody's going to flop most of the
money<00:03:57.820> is<00:03:57.910> made<00:03:58.180> in<00:03:58.330> my<00:03:58.510> game<00:03:58.810> from<00:03:59.050> taking

00:03:59.430 --> 00:03:59.440 
money is made in my game from taking

00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:00.810 
money is made in my game from taking
players<00:03:59.650> to<00:03:59.830> the<00:03:59.920> Turner<00:04:00.160> river<00:04:00.490> and<00:04:00.730> then

players to the Turner river and then

00:04:00.820 --> 00:04:02.610 
players to the Turner river and then
exploiting<00:04:01.330> them<00:04:01.450> that's<00:04:02.080> where<00:04:02.230> most<00:04:02.410> of

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:02.620 
exploiting them that's where most of

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:06.480 
exploiting them that's where most of
your<00:04:02.709> money<00:04:02.860> is<00:04:03.010> going<00:04:03.100> to<00:04:03.190> come<00:04:03.220> from<00:04:05.220> yeah<00:04:06.220> so

and then post flop experience comes from

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:11.430 
and then post flop experience comes from

from a lot of experience that's one of

00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:14.280 
from a lot of experience that's one of
the<00:04:13.060> things<00:04:13.180> you<00:04:13.300> see<00:04:13.480> in<00:04:13.510> players<00:04:14.170> you've

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:14.290

and thinking about the game for a long
long<00:04:17.350> long<00:04:17.470> time<00:04:17.739> will<00:04:18.310> have<00:04:18.489> a<00:04:18.700> lot<00:04:19.000> better

long long time will have a lot better

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:21.690 
long long time will have a lot better
post<00:04:20.170> flop<00:04:20.320> skills<00:04:20.650> which<00:04:21.220> is<00:04:21.250> very<00:04:21.549> very
