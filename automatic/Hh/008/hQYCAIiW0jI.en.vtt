things that probably will never figure
it<00:01:30.390> out<00:01:30.600> because<00:01:31.229> it<00:01:31.470> is<00:01:31.710> like<00:01:32.150> the<00:01:33.150> thous

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:33.560 
it out because it is like the thous

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:35.450 
it out because it is like the thous
light-years<00:01:34.560> away<00:01:34.740> i<00:01:34.890> don't<00:01:35.100> know<00:01:35.280> how<00:01:35.400> many

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030 
or something like that is it's like lots

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:43.700 
or something like that is it's like lots
of<00:01:42.240> light-years<00:01:42.540> away<00:01:42.960> which<00:01:43.110> I<00:01:43.470> don't<00:01:43.530> know

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:43.710 
of light-years away which I don't know

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:45.260 
of light-years away which I don't know
how<00:01:44.189> many<00:01:44.399> but<00:01:44.490> it<00:01:44.790> doesn't<00:01:45.030> really<00:01:45.090> matter

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:45.270 
how many but it doesn't really matter

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:48.859 
how many but it doesn't really matter
the<00:01:45.540> thing<00:01:45.720> is<00:01:45.899> is<00:01:46.049> that<00:01:47.600> actually<00:01:48.600> that's<00:01:48.780> not

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:48.869 
the thing is is that actually that's not

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:50.870 
the thing is is that actually that's not
true<00:01:48.990> sorry<00:01:49.380> the<00:01:49.560> closest<00:01:49.979> 1i<00:01:50.159> they<00:01:50.520> believe

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880 
true sorry the closest 1i they believe

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:52.940 
true sorry the closest 1i they believe
is<00:01:51.119> in<00:01:51.299> our<00:01:51.540> galaxy<00:01:51.869> at<00:01:52.229> the<00:01:52.320> center<00:01:52.619> it's<00:01:52.770> why

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950 
is in our galaxy at the center it's why

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:56.240 
is in our galaxy at the center it's why
we're<00:01:53.220> spinning<00:01:53.579> around<00:01:53.850> our<00:01:54.210> galaxy<00:01:54.689> so<00:01:55.250> one

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:56.250 
we're spinning around our galaxy so one

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:58.179 
we're spinning around our galaxy so one
of<00:01:56.280> the<00:01:56.430> things<00:01:56.490> I<00:01:56.820> wanted<00:01:57.450> to<00:01:57.540> say<00:01:57.630> is<00:01:58.049> uh

00:01:58.179 --> 00:01:58.189 
of the things I wanted to say is uh

00:01:58.189 --> 00:02:00.530 
of the things I wanted to say is uh
there's<00:01:59.189> this<00:01:59.430> thing<00:01:59.670> called<00:01:59.700> the<00:02:00.030> event

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:00.540 
there's this thing called the event

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:03.109 
there's this thing called the event
horizon<00:02:00.780> which<00:02:01.710> just<00:02:02.009> sounds<00:02:02.219> sweet<00:02:02.790> if<00:02:03.000> you

00:02:03.109 --> 00:02:03.119 
horizon which just sounds sweet if you

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:04.940 
horizon which just sounds sweet if you
just<00:02:03.149> think<00:02:03.420> about<00:02:03.630> the<00:02:03.869> name<00:02:04.049> what<00:02:04.259> it<00:02:04.380> the

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:04.950 
just think about the name what it the

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:08.630 
just think about the name what it the
event<00:02:05.159> horizon<00:02:05.280> is<00:02:05.700> is<00:02:05.909> where<00:02:06.180> the<00:02:06.810> point<00:02:07.640> near

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:08.640 
event horizon is is where the point near

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:10.520 
event horizon is is where the point near
the<00:02:08.759> black<00:02:09.060> hole<00:02:09.090> where<00:02:09.720> once<00:02:09.989> you<00:02:10.140> get<00:02:10.319> in

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:10.530 
the black hole where once you get in

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:12.900 
the black hole where once you get in
that<00:02:10.560> radius<00:02:11.250> you<00:02:12.150> cannot<00:02:12.420> escape

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:12.910 
that radius you cannot escape

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:15.810 
that radius you cannot escape
going<00:02:13.360> as<00:02:13.600> fat<00:02:14.020> or<00:02:14.260> what<00:02:15.100> even<00:02:15.370> light<00:02:15.550> cannot

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:15.820 
going as fat or what even light cannot

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:17.460 
going as fat or what even light cannot
escape<00:02:16.000> sorry<00:02:16.540> that<00:02:16.720> was<00:02:16.810> kind<00:02:16.990> of<00:02:17.020> badly

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:17.470 
escape sorry that was kind of badly

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:19.920 
escape sorry that was kind of badly
worded<00:02:17.800> but<00:02:18.210> even<00:02:19.210> that<00:02:19.330> was<00:02:19.510> poorly<00:02:19.780> worded

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:19.930 
worded but even that was poorly worded

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:22.710 
worded but even that was poorly worded
jeez<00:02:20.440> oh<00:02:20.860> my<00:02:21.040> god<00:02:21.190> but<00:02:21.520> so<00:02:22.090> that's<00:02:22.240> a<00:02:22.360> point<00:02:22.600> to

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:22.720 
jeez oh my god but so that's a point to

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:24.810 
jeez oh my god but so that's a point to
where<00:02:22.840> light<00:02:23.110> cannot<00:02:23.350> escape<00:02:23.410> from<00:02:24.100> from<00:02:24.730> the

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:24.820 
where light cannot escape from from the

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:27.720 
where light cannot escape from from the
gravitational<00:02:25.540> pull<00:02:25.570> of<00:02:25.780> the<00:02:26.350> black<00:02:27.190> holes<00:02:27.430> oh

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:27.730 
gravitational pull of the black holes oh

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:29.910 
gravitational pull of the black holes oh
and<00:02:28.030> I<00:02:28.180> sounds<00:02:28.480> like<00:02:28.600> such<00:02:28.810> a<00:02:28.840> nerd<00:02:29.080> oh<00:02:29.320> my<00:02:29.680> god

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:29.920 
and I sounds like such a nerd oh my god

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:33.690 
and I sounds like such a nerd oh my god
whatever<00:02:30.310> but<00:02:31.110> so<00:02:32.110> that's<00:02:32.560> where<00:02:32.740> light<00:02:33.520> can't

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:33.700 
whatever but so that's where light can't

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:36.150 
whatever but so that's where light can't
escape<00:02:33.820> and<00:02:34.300> just<00:02:34.510> the<00:02:34.660> word<00:02:34.870> event<00:02:35.470> horizon

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:36.160 
escape and just the word event horizon

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:39.060 
escape and just the word event horizon
just<00:02:36.370> sounds<00:02:36.610> like<00:02:36.670> it's<00:02:37.420> like<00:02:37.570> power<00:02:37.900> I<00:02:38.380> don't

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:39.070 
just sounds like it's like power I don't

00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:41.490 
just sounds like it's like power I don't
know<00:02:39.130> I<00:02:39.160> think<00:02:39.400> I<00:02:40.030> rising<00:02:40.690> just<00:02:40.930> cool<00:02:41.140> word<00:02:41.290> and

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:41.500 
know I think I rising just cool word and

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:44.940 
know I think I rising just cool word and
then<00:02:41.620> like<00:02:42.070> event<00:02:42.460> horizon<00:02:43.000> oh<00:02:43.120> my<00:02:43.240> god<00:02:43.950> but

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:44.950 
then like event horizon oh my god but

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:47.100 
then like event horizon oh my god but
the<00:02:45.670> thing<00:02:45.700> is<00:02:45.880> it's<00:02:46.210> about<00:02:46.360> black<00:02:46.600> holes<00:02:46.810> is

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:47.110 
the thing is it's about black holes is

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:50.040 
the thing is it's about black holes is
that<00:02:47.320> they<00:02:47.500> don't<00:02:48.190> actually<00:02:48.430> suck<00:02:49.300> stuff<00:02:49.840> in

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:50.050 
that they don't actually suck stuff in

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:52.800 
that they don't actually suck stuff in
they<00:02:50.230> do<00:02:50.290> more<00:02:50.590> than<00:02:50.740> that<00:02:51.450> one<00:02:52.450> of<00:02:52.540> the<00:02:52.600> things

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:52.810 
they do more than that one of the things

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:55.050 
they do more than that one of the things
they<00:02:52.960> do<00:02:53.020> is<00:02:53.380> once<00:02:53.740> they<00:02:53.950> get<00:02:54.190> enough<00:02:54.670> matter

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:55.060 
they do is once they get enough matter

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:59.070 
they do is once they get enough matter
inside<00:02:55.570> of<00:02:55.780> them<00:02:55.900> they<00:02:56.580> they<00:02:57.580> eject<00:02:58.090> like<00:02:58.780> all

00:02:59.070 --> 00:02:59.080 
inside of them they they eject like all

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:01.470 
inside of them they they eject like all
the<00:02:59.740> matter<00:02:59.980> back<00:03:00.250> out<00:03:00.460> so<00:03:00.760> it's<00:03:01.060> like<00:03:01.240> kind<00:03:01.270> of

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:01.480 
the matter back out so it's like kind of

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:03.030 
the matter back out so it's like kind of
like<00:03:01.600> it's<00:03:01.870> like<00:03:02.020> burping<00:03:02.410> I<00:03:02.560> guess<00:03:02.740> you<00:03:02.920> could

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:03.040 
like it's like burping I guess you could

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:04.920 
like it's like burping I guess you could
say<00:03:03.190> it's<00:03:03.310> like<00:03:03.520> oh<00:03:03.670> I<00:03:03.730> ate<00:03:04.210> too<00:03:04.360> much<00:03:04.510> blood

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:04.930 
say it's like oh I ate too much blood

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:06.960 
say it's like oh I ate too much blood
here<00:03:05.650> you<00:03:05.830> go<00:03:05.950> or<00:03:06.100> maybe<00:03:06.280> like<00:03:06.490> throwing<00:03:06.730> up<00:03:06.820> I

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:06.970 
here you go or maybe like throwing up I

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:09.000 
here you go or maybe like throwing up I
don't<00:03:07.000> know<00:03:07.180> oh<00:03:07.560> but<00:03:08.560> it's<00:03:08.710> pretty<00:03:08.830> much<00:03:08.950> the

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:09.010 
don't know oh but it's pretty much the

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:11.130 
don't know oh but it's pretty much the
same<00:03:09.250> thing<00:03:09.310> so<00:03:09.820> I'm<00:03:10.450> pretty<00:03:10.570> much<00:03:10.690> just<00:03:10.810> like

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:11.140 
same thing so I'm pretty much just like

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:14.250 
same thing so I'm pretty much just like
explodes<00:03:11.800> matter<00:03:12.130> back<00:03:12.790> out<00:03:13.000> so<00:03:13.330> I<00:03:13.570> don't<00:03:14.200> know

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:14.260 
explodes matter back out so I don't know

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:17.520 
explodes matter back out so I don't know
just<00:03:14.440> kind<00:03:14.650> of<00:03:14.710> some<00:03:14.890> cool<00:03:15.100> facts<00:03:15.460> about<00:03:16.530> about

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:17.530 
just kind of some cool facts about about

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:20.610 
just kind of some cool facts about about
space<00:03:18.010> and<00:03:18.040> how<00:03:18.640> how<00:03:19.000> distant<00:03:19.870> it<00:03:20.080> really<00:03:20.440> is

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:20.620 
space and how how distant it really is

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:23.730 
space and how how distant it really is
and<00:03:21.030> another<00:03:22.030> thing<00:03:22.120> is<00:03:22.480> is<00:03:22.750> the<00:03:22.990> spacecraft

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:23.740 
and another thing is is the spacecraft

00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:25.290 
and another thing is is the spacecraft
voyager<00:03:24.459> i<00:03:24.490> believe<00:03:24.820> it's<00:03:24.940> called<00:03:25.060> there's

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:25.300 
voyager i believe it's called there's

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:27.690 
voyager i believe it's called there's
two<00:03:25.540> of<00:03:25.570> them<00:03:25.690> they<00:03:26.050> actually<00:03:26.590> launched<00:03:27.580> them

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:27.700 
two of them they actually launched them

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:29.340 
two of them they actually launched them
back<00:03:27.820> in<00:03:28.000> like<00:03:28.120> the<00:03:28.270> 70s<00:03:28.720> and<00:03:28.870> they're<00:03:29.050> just

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:29.350 
back in like the 70s and they're just
