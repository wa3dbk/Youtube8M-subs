00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:13.550
 when I first heard it unexpectedly 

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:15.530

00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:16.049
 Small to find a CJ in the grove area

00:04:17.610 --> 00:04:22.230
 we are not told his name 

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:25.140

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:34.110
 map 

00:04:29.910 --> 00:04:34.710
 I searched for a very long time and found no kill 

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:36.890
 came out 

00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:40.320
 however, a dramatic situation occurred 

00:04:36.890 --> 00:04:42.660
 chase maybe even for your 

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:45.420

00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:47.940
 did with aunt denis hot coffee 

00:04:45.420 --> 00:04:49.050
 then just watch how it was me 

00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:52.050
 couldn't kill him and 

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:54.930
 hand did not rise until he escaped 

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:57.030

00:04:57.030 --> 00:05:03.300
