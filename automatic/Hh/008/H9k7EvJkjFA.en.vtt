00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
craft here i go to craft and it says

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:24.380 
craft here i go to craft and it says
required<00:01:21.869> parts<00:01:22.439> and<00:01:22.650> these<00:01:23.369> parts<00:01:23.850> look<00:01:24.090> this

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
required parts and these parts look this

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:26.450 
required parts and these parts look this
is<00:01:24.509> so<00:01:24.750> difficult<00:01:25.080> to<00:01:25.530> find<00:01:25.799> like<00:01:26.220> i<00:01:26.250> haven't

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 
is so difficult to find like i haven't

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:28.359 
is so difficult to find like i haven't
got<00:01:26.640> a<00:01:26.670> clue<00:01:26.970> where<00:01:27.299> any<00:01:27.450> of<00:01:27.540> these<00:01:27.659> parts<00:01:28.080> are

00:01:28.359 --> 00:01:28.369 
got a clue where any of these parts are

00:01:28.369 --> 00:01:30.980 
got a clue where any of these parts are
you<00:01:29.369> sort<00:01:29.610> pick<00:01:29.820> them<00:01:29.970> up<00:01:30.000> randomly<00:01:30.600> but

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
you sort pick them up randomly but

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:32.600 
you sort pick them up randomly but
getting<00:01:31.439> enough<00:01:31.650> for<00:01:31.860> these<00:01:31.950> is<00:01:32.130> ridiculous

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
getting enough for these is ridiculous

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:34.160 
getting enough for these is ridiculous
so<00:01:32.759> you<00:01:32.820> generally<00:01:33.390> bind<00:01:33.659> them<00:01:33.810> with<00:01:33.960> gear

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.170 
so you generally bind them with gear

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:36.440 
so you generally bind them with gear
points<00:01:34.729> dew<00:01:35.729> points<00:01:36.060> are<00:01:36.119> unlocked

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
points dew points are unlocked

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:38.870 
points dew points are unlocked
throughout<00:01:37.140> the<00:01:37.530> throughout<00:01:38.189> playing<00:01:38.610> so

throughout the throughout playing so

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:40.940 
throughout the throughout playing so
it's<00:01:39.180> not<00:01:39.420> you<00:01:39.600> don't<00:01:39.990> pay<00:01:40.259> for<00:01:40.290> them<00:01:40.650> as<00:01:40.770> such

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
it's not you don't pay for them as such

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:42.469 
it's not you don't pay for them as such
it's<00:01:41.189> easy<00:01:41.369> enough<00:01:41.490> to<00:01:41.610> get<00:01:41.850> loads<00:01:42.210> of<00:01:42.360> them

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:42.479 
it's easy enough to get loads of them

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:44.120 
it's easy enough to get loads of them
I've<00:01:42.630> got<00:01:42.780> three<00:01:43.259> and<00:01:43.380> a<00:01:43.409> half<00:01:43.470> hundred

this is a this is a pretty powerful
weapon<00:01:52.560> and<00:01:52.770> what<00:01:53.310> I'm<00:01:53.520> going<00:01:53.549> to<00:01:53.880> because<00:01:54.479> I'm

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:54.600 
weapon and what I'm going to because I'm

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:56.120 
weapon and what I'm going to because I'm
going<00:01:54.689> to<00:01:54.750> be<00:01:54.810> using<00:01:54.960> it<00:01:55.200> on<00:01:55.259> my<00:01:55.409> fuse<00:01:55.770> what<00:01:56.040> I'm

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:56.130 
going to be using it on my fuse what I'm

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:58.010 
going to be using it on my fuse what I'm
going<00:01:56.280> to<00:01:56.340> be<00:01:56.430> aiming<00:01:56.880> for<00:01:57.119> is<00:01:57.270> a<00:01:57.299> tack<00:01:57.659> speed

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020 
going to be aiming for is a tack speed

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:01.789 
going to be aiming for is a tack speed
and<00:01:58.229> crit<00:01:58.850> so<00:02:00.020> there<00:02:01.020> are<00:02:01.170> different<00:02:01.409> ways<00:02:01.740> to

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:01.799 
and crit so there are different ways to

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:04.789 
and crit so there are different ways to
build<00:02:02.159> different<00:02:02.430> characters<00:02:03.060> and<00:02:03.420> I<00:02:04.020> don't

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:04.799 
build different characters and I don't

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:08.150 
build different characters and I don't
like<00:02:05.159> being<00:02:05.759> in<00:02:05.969> the<00:02:06.000> melee<00:02:06.390> with<00:02:06.860> few<00:02:07.860> so<00:02:08.129> I

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:08.160 
like being in the melee with few so I

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:11.300 
like being in the melee with few so I
don't<00:02:08.520> think<00:02:09.060> block<00:02:09.599> is

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:11.310 
don't think block is

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:13.440 
don't think block is
ultimately<00:02:12.310> that<00:02:12.400> necessary<00:02:12.970> I<00:02:13.090> need<00:02:13.270> to<00:02:13.360> be

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:13.450 
ultimately that necessary I need to be

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:15.180 
ultimately that necessary I need to be
getting<00:02:13.480> in<00:02:13.810> lots<00:02:14.020> of<00:02:14.170> damage<00:02:14.379> quickly<00:02:14.800> and

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:15.190 
getting in lots of damage quickly and

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:18.059 
getting in lots of damage quickly and
then<00:02:15.340> evading<00:02:16.060> so<00:02:16.390> stamina<00:02:17.050> attack<00:02:17.590> speed<00:02:17.739> and

00:02:18.059 --> 00:02:18.069 
then evading so stamina attack speed and

00:02:18.069 --> 00:02:22.020 
then evading so stamina attack speed and
create<00:02:18.340> very<00:02:18.640> very<00:02:19.030> good<00:02:19.360> for<00:02:19.660> me<00:02:19.830> as<00:02:20.830> a<00:02:21.489> sort

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:22.030 
create very very good for me as a sort

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:24.390 
create very very good for me as a sort
of<00:02:22.090> attributes<00:02:22.720> so<00:02:22.989> what<00:02:23.739> we'll<00:02:23.890> do<00:02:24.069> is<00:02:24.099> I'm

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:24.400 
of attributes so what we'll do is I'm

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:27.990 
of attributes so what we'll do is I'm
going<00:02:24.550> to<00:02:24.610> craft<00:02:25.000> this<00:02:25.360> now<00:02:26.370> 244,000<00:02:27.370> points

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:28.000 
going to craft this now 244,000 points

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.979 
going to craft this now 244,000 points
going<00:02:28.650> craft<00:02:30.150> wait<00:02:31.150> for<00:02:31.360> the<00:02:31.450> server<00:02:31.720> and

00:02:31.979 --> 00:02:31.989 
going craft wait for the server and

00:02:31.989 --> 00:02:34.350 
going craft wait for the server and
there<00:02:32.410> it<00:02:32.560> is<00:02:32.680> look<00:02:32.890> at<00:02:33.069> what<00:02:33.280> motors<00:02:33.790> tycoon

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:34.360 
there it is look at what motors tycoon

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:37.199 
there it is look at what motors tycoon
drew<00:02:34.690> that<00:02:35.110> is<00:02:35.260> badass<00:02:35.620> but<00:02:36.190> it<00:02:36.430> says<00:02:36.819> ordinary

00:02:37.199 --> 00:02:37.209 
drew that is badass but it says ordinary

00:02:37.209 --> 00:02:39.180 
drew that is badass but it says ordinary
at<00:02:37.299> the<00:02:37.360> moment<00:02:37.690> because<00:02:37.989> it's<00:02:38.260> on<00:02:38.349> level<00:02:38.769> zero

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:39.190 
at the moment because it's on level zero

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:41.369 
at the moment because it's on level zero
so<00:02:39.849> I've<00:02:40.060> got<00:02:40.330> to<00:02:40.360> a<00:02:40.510> play<00:02:40.840> with<00:02:40.870> that<00:02:41.170> and
