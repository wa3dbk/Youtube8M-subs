00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
 and very good friends of youtube like 

00:00:01.290 --> 00:00:04.529
 are the greetings renee james and good 

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.640
 here with a new guide with the guide 

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:10.309
 varus let's start with 

00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:12.980
 with the skills of passive peace and 

00:00:10.309 --> 00:00:15.920
 bibs is that when they killed a champion 

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:17.750
 enemy we are going to gain 40% speed 

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:19.730
 of attack for six seconds or at 

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:23.990
 kill an enemy subject we will win 

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:25.100
 20% for three seconds okay we go with 

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:27.590
 the cv 

00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:29.600
 go several throws an arrow that how much 

00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:31.670
 more time we have punished 

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:34.850
 the longer we have it tight 

00:00:31.670 --> 00:00:37.540
 the CV further range will go further and 

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:37.540
 more harm is going to have 

00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:43.290
 the w the basic attacks is to say the 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:44.990
 double has a passive I do not know spanish 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:47.790
 we can tighten it for always active 

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:49.650
 the basic attacks of varus inflict 

00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:51.960
 additional magic damage and apply 

00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:53.770
 infection and later we will see 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:55.390
 what does each one do 

00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:57.790
 the one of varus throws a storm of 

00:00:55.390 --> 00:01:00.970
 arrows inflicts physical and secular damage on 

00:00:57.790 --> 00:01:02.170
 the soil this profane soil is to say 

00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:04.920
 the soil that is the soil that is 

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:07.650
 marked on the map 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:09.630
 reduces the speed of movements to the 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:12.570
 mobility of the enemy champion and reduces 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:13.710
 its healing or regeneration that is 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:15.780
 that if the change wants to regenerate 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:17.659
 attacking us will not be able to because 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:20.840
 is the soil desecrated 

00:01:17.659 --> 00:01:24.740
 and the last of several has ranges like 

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:25.909
 can see here and throws like a few if 

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:28.670
 outside some fabrics so they are giving 

00:01:25.909 --> 00:01:30.590
 turns immobilizes a champion to 

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:32.600
 first that gives you if there are champions at 

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:35.700
 side of him will mobilize them after 

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:37.380
 that are happening one by one 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:40.259
 well now let's see what about 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:43.659
 skil good we go with the one we already have 

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:46.240
 tight here comes the time 

00:01:43.659 --> 00:01:49.270
 and we throw it the longer the 

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:51.789
 we have tighter more range and more damage 

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:55.210
 is going to be let's go back with one more 

00:01:51.789 --> 00:01:57.939
 well it reaches the range we hope a little bit 

00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:59.140
 we can move while you read and 

00:01:57.939 --> 00:02:00.340
 while we have to tighten some 

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:01.689
 we can move quietly going to 

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:03.670
 reduce our movement speed 

00:02:01.689 --> 00:02:05.700
 obviously but we will be able to move a 

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:05.700
 coma 

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:13.400
 in the punish we can move 

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:15.439
 and let's say 

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:17.780
 well let's see what the w w 

00:02:15.439 --> 00:02:22.310
 affects our basic attacks is 

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:24.049
 say 1 2 and 3 those birds that you can 

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:26.239
 be that to those circuits that w 

00:02:24.049 --> 00:02:28.329
 they spin around as we explode that 

00:02:26.239 --> 00:02:31.710
 passive with the q of several for example 

00:02:28.329 --> 00:02:33.770
 we throw an auto attack 2 

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:35.890
 3 

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:38.650
 and we throw the voice 

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:43.900
 and the damage is enhanced and they explode because 

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:48.019
 they exploit that passive of the good w we go 

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:51.860
 let's see her let's see her 

00:02:48.019 --> 00:02:55.180
 is this range that you are seeing here 

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:55.180
 appear in the center 

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:59.920
 within the range that we can throw it without 

00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:03.040
 observe or will be getting closer to the 

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:05.110
 objective and they will drill the ground by 

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:07.060
 example like that and ana just takes to appear 

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:10.980
 up with an ignacio and that's going to 

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:10.980
 prevent regenerating life or healing 

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:15.440
 well now let's see let's see the 

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:17.470
 last and good let's see what is it 

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:20.720
 which is the last 

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:22.340
 the last in this range can see 

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:24.140
 we will afford the areas that in the same 

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:26.690
 rank that is here 

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:29.120
 we go a little bit further 

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:30.500
 and at this time blue is not going to 

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:32.980
 being able to move is immobilized by the 

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:35.890
 period of time that comes up 

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:38.980
 with 2 seconds if there were chance allies 

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:40.750
 of blue next to it would remain 

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:43.360
 immobilized at the end of time in 

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:46.239
 that is immobilized in blue that is 

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:48.730
 is the time it is ends 

00:03:46.239 --> 00:03:50.200
 immobilized in blue and it happens to a 

00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:52.060
 Allied champion in case they are 

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:55.410
 come out obviously you can get away and from 

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:58.020
 that way the last one would be canceled 

00:03:55.410 --> 00:04:00.540
 well let's see the objects the 

00:03:58.020 --> 00:04:03.240
 objects with which we started the 

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:05.400
 initial objects are worshiping a 

00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:07.710
 pats of dhoran a position and the team 

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:09.600
 that is yellow what he says is 

00:04:07.710 --> 00:04:11.400
 yellow the red at the beginning is not removed 

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:13.680
 because we can help sleep with the 

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:15.450
 play if it 's more in late game we can 

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:17.760
 we can get to take out the red for 

00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:19.829
 eliminate play of the dragon baron 

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:21.810
 etc 

00:04:19.829 --> 00:04:24.320
 he wants us to pray that we can 

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:26.770
 take 

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:29.410
 we can take it out 

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:30.620
 a bloodthirsty as I also achieved 

00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:32.720
 Appear 

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:34.040
 a bloodthirsty boots to see close is 

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:35.660
 those that give us attack speed 

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:37.940
 one of the uip the last basics 

00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:41.169
 because they are called in Spanish is blue blue 

00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:44.050
 and there is a narco 

00:04:41.169 --> 00:04:46.749
 and fervor that is in English that are both 

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:49.689
 crossed swords yellow after that 

00:04:46.749 --> 00:04:51.909
 let's take out we can take out the dagger 

00:04:49.689 --> 00:04:54.810
 static as you see here or the phantom dancer 

00:04:51.909 --> 00:04:57.300
 or what is the spectral dancer 

00:04:54.810 --> 00:05:00.240
 and the wii obviously completes the mouths 

00:04:57.300 --> 00:05:03.180
 on screen they are watching 

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:06.330
 that would be bloodthirsty fandom dancer 

00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:08.789
 spectral the whisper is blue boots 

00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:10.440
 berserker guardian at infinity 

00:05:08.789 --> 00:05:13.310
 that would be pretty much the complete build 

00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:16.480
 can vary one or another item 

00:05:13.310 --> 00:05:19.070
 let's see in what order we do not upload the 

00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:21.200
 skills the skills of several like 

00:05:19.070 --> 00:05:23.480
 also never on screen will it be to 

00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:25.580
 level 1 a point at qa level 2 1 

00:05:23.480 --> 00:05:29.150
 online point and level 3 a point in the 

00:05:25.580 --> 00:05:31.160
 w since we prioritize the q after the e and 

00:05:29.150 --> 00:05:36.310
 Finally the w and the war is a 

00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:36.310
 corresponding to levels 6 11 and 16 

00:05:37.210 --> 00:05:42.340
 well let's see what else trias not 

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:44.710
 we use with several also to sing 

00:05:42.340 --> 00:05:47.530
 and the classic September 21 can for use 

00:05:44.710 --> 00:05:50.080
 the video and you can see them like that they put them together 

00:05:47.530 --> 00:05:52.820
 so you in your your accounts the runes 

00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:55.970
 the desire can be two 

00:05:52.820 --> 00:05:58.190
 some can be with fifths of ade 

00:05:55.970 --> 00:06:00.920
 with fifths of life robbery we are going to 

00:05:58.190 --> 00:06:02.540
 repeat so we put them on the screen with 

00:06:00.920 --> 00:06:04.810
 fifths of d are these are the 

00:06:02.540 --> 00:06:06.880
 appearing on the screen 

00:06:04.810 --> 00:06:08.950
 and the theft of life are these 

00:06:06.880 --> 00:06:11.950
 they are here I have only one me in this case 

00:06:08.950 --> 00:06:13.300
 well I have a single life steal 

00:06:11.950 --> 00:06:15.639
 because you can put all three of them 

00:06:13.300 --> 00:06:19.530
 life robbery and the brands of 

00:06:15.639 --> 00:06:19.530
 of attac is more of physical damage 

00:06:19.660 --> 00:06:24.430
 good and I hope we can get it out 

00:06:21.430 --> 00:06:26.710
 several are neighborhoods and flash or flash and 

00:06:24.430 --> 00:06:28.360
 depending on which neighborhoods where used in 

00:06:26.710 --> 00:06:30.460
 of good efe 

00:06:28.360 --> 00:06:31.960
 and they are the face slab count joints of 

00:06:30.460 --> 00:06:35.099
 Carrie is removed neighborhood and flash 

00:06:31.960 --> 00:06:35.099
 nothing else 

00:06:35.230 --> 00:06:40.810
