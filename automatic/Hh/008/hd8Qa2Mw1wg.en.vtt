00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:14.750 
no maybe not let me just pull that back
a<00:03:12.960> bit<00:03:13.110> so<00:03:13.500> you<00:03:13.590> got<00:03:13.740> this<00:03:13.890> little<00:03:14.070> tab<00:03:14.430> right

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:14.760 
a bit so you got this little tab right

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:17.360 
a bit so you got this little tab right
here<00:03:14.790> that<00:03:15.300> you<00:03:15.930> got<00:03:16.080> to<00:03:16.230> pull<00:03:16.800> out<00:03:16.830> with<00:03:17.160> your

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:17.370 
here that you got to pull out with your

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:21.590 
here that you got to pull out with your
thumb<00:03:18.320> of<00:03:19.320> course<00:03:19.850> and<00:03:20.850> then<00:03:21.210> that<00:03:21.360> will<00:03:21.570> allow

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:21.600 
thumb of course and then that will allow

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:27.670 
thumb of course and then that will allow
you<00:03:21.840> to<00:03:22.100> lift<00:03:23.100> up<00:03:23.310> the<00:03:23.460> rest<00:03:23.640> of<00:03:23.820> it<00:03:23.940> here

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:27.680 

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:30.100 

alternately<00:03:28.680> I<00:03:28.770> guess<00:03:29.070> you<00:03:29.250> could<00:03:29.460> open<00:03:29.820> it

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:30.110 
alternately I guess you could open it

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:33.380 
alternately I guess you could open it
using<00:03:31.110> this<00:03:31.440> as<00:03:31.710> well<00:03:31.980> over<00:03:32.340> here<00:03:32.790> so<00:03:33.180> there's

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:33.390 
using this as well over here so there's

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:34.580 
using this as well over here so there's
another<00:03:33.630> you<00:03:34.020> know<00:03:34.110> thing<00:03:34.290> where<00:03:34.440> you<00:03:34.500> can

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:34.590 
another you know thing where you can

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:35.720 
another you know thing where you can
pull<00:03:34.710> off<00:03:34.800> and<00:03:34.920> you<00:03:35.010> got<00:03:35.070> no<00:03:35.220> tape<00:03:35.430> to<00:03:35.580> mess

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:35.730 
pull off and you got no tape to mess

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:38.780 
pull off and you got no tape to mess
with<00:03:35.910> but<00:03:36.620> you<00:03:37.620> know<00:03:37.740> you're<00:03:38.190> kind<00:03:38.400> of<00:03:38.460> messing

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:40.230 
with like the whole box in general where

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:41.450 
with like the whole box in general where
is<00:03:40.260> this<00:03:40.500> I<00:03:40.650> can<00:03:40.800> probably<00:03:40.950> just<00:03:41.250> slide

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:41.460 
is this I can probably just slide

00:03:41.460 --> 00:03:44.600 
is this I can probably just slide
everything<00:03:41.730> out<00:03:42.030> so<00:03:42.709> let's<00:03:43.709> test<00:03:44.400> that<00:03:44.520> out

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:44.610 
everything out so let's test that out

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:49.600 
everything out so let's test that out
real<00:03:44.970> quick<00:03:45.180> here

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:49.610 

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:52.640 

stop<00:03:50.610> doing<00:03:50.879> this<00:03:50.970> one-handed<00:03:51.360> but<00:03:51.720> you<00:03:52.560> know

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:52.650 
stop doing this one-handed but you know

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:58.280 
stop doing this one-handed but you know
how<00:03:52.739> it<00:03:52.860> is<00:03:54.379> okay<00:03:55.519> got<00:03:56.519> it<00:03:56.549> out<00:03:56.790> enough<00:03:57.120> that<00:03:57.780> I

00:03:58.280 --> 00:03:58.290 
how it is okay got it out enough that I

00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:05.569 
how it is okay got it out enough that I
think<00:03:58.349> we<00:03:59.190> can<00:03:59.340> go<00:03:59.459> ahead<00:03:59.580> and<00:04:03.560> I<00:04:04.560> guess<00:04:05.400> I'll

00:04:05.569 --> 00:04:05.579 
think we can go ahead and I guess I'll

00:04:05.579 --> 00:04:07.490 
think we can go ahead and I guess I'll
just<00:04:05.700> pause<00:04:06.090> it<00:04:06.390> so<00:04:06.659> I<00:04:06.750> can<00:04:06.900> pull<00:04:07.049> it<00:04:07.200> out<00:04:07.260> of

everything like that

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:47.120 
everything like that
look<00:04:44.490> at<00:04:44.610> that<00:04:44.789> made<00:04:45.120> in<00:04:45.300> China<00:04:46.010> imagine<00:04:47.010> that

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:47.130 
look at that made in China imagine that

00:04:47.130 --> 00:04:50.810 
look at that made in China imagine that
everything<00:04:47.400> is<00:04:49.070> so<00:04:50.070> you've<00:04:50.190> got<00:04:50.340> this<00:04:50.490> plastic

00:04:50.810 --> 00:04:50.820 
everything is so you've got this plastic

00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:52.900 
everything is so you've got this plastic
thing<00:04:51.180> here<00:04:51.660> which<00:04:51.870> covers<00:04:52.229> up<00:04:52.350> a<00:04:52.470> skateboard

thing here which covers up a skateboard

00:04:52.910 --> 00:04:59.560 
thing here which covers up a skateboard

batteries you don't get any real quality
ones<00:05:07.950> but<00:05:08.810> I'm<00:05:09.810> sure<00:05:09.990> they're<00:05:10.080> probably<00:05:10.200> lasts

00:05:10.490 --> 00:05:10.500 
ones but I'm sure they're probably lasts

00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:12.650 
ones but I'm sure they're probably lasts
at<00:05:10.620> least<00:05:10.650> a<00:05:10.830> couple<00:05:10.979> of<00:05:11.160> hours<00:05:11.460> so<00:05:12.300> put<00:05:12.510> those

00:05:12.650 --> 00:05:12.660 
at least a couple of hours so put those

00:05:12.660 --> 00:05:19.070 
at least a couple of hours so put those
there<00:05:13.370> and<00:05:14.370> we<00:05:14.669> also<00:05:14.940> got<00:05:17.660> these<00:05:18.660> they<00:05:18.840> really

00:05:19.070 --> 00:05:19.080 
there and we also got these they really

00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:20.540 
there and we also got these they really
got<00:05:19.229> this<00:05:19.349> thing<00:05:19.560> in<00:05:19.650> here<00:05:19.770> this<00:05:19.949> well<00:05:20.160> package

00:05:20.540 --> 00:05:20.550 
got this thing in here this well package

00:05:20.550 --> 00:05:24.020 
got this thing in here this well package
though<00:05:21.080> this<00:05:22.080> is<00:05:22.320> just<00:05:22.620> kind<00:05:22.800> of<00:05:22.860> like<00:05:22.979> a<00:05:23.030> USB

00:05:24.020 --> 00:05:24.030 
though this is just kind of like a USB

00:05:24.030 --> 00:05:27.040 
though this is just kind of like a USB
adapter<00:05:24.300> with<00:05:24.930> the<00:05:24.960> infrared<00:05:25.530> sensor<00:05:26.070> or

00:05:27.040 --> 00:05:27.050 
adapter with the infrared sensor or

00:05:27.050 --> 00:05:30.140 
adapter with the infrared sensor or
something<00:05:28.050> of<00:05:28.139> that<00:05:28.169> nature<00:05:28.320> I<00:05:28.710> guess<00:05:28.800> to<00:05:29.370> you

00:05:30.140 --> 00:05:30.150 
something of that nature I guess to you

00:05:30.150 --> 00:05:31.520 
something of that nature I guess to you
know<00:05:30.270> a<00:05:30.300> lot<00:05:30.330> of<00:05:30.449> kids<00:05:30.960> the<00:05:31.139> skateboard

00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:31.530 
know a lot of kids the skateboard

00:05:31.530 --> 00:05:32.689 
know a lot of kids the skateboard
communicate<00:05:31.949> I<00:05:31.979> don't<00:05:32.160> know<00:05:32.220> why<00:05:32.370> they<00:05:32.520> can't

00:05:32.689 --> 00:05:32.699 
communicate I don't know why they can't

00:05:32.699 --> 00:05:35.240 
communicate I don't know why they can't
just<00:05:32.880> use<00:05:33.000> bluetooth<00:05:33.449> at<00:05:34.410> least<00:05:34.620> for<00:05:34.919> the<00:05:34.979> ps3

00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:35.250 
just use bluetooth at least for the ps3

00:05:35.250 --> 00:05:37.969 
just use bluetooth at least for the ps3
because<00:05:35.789> the<00:05:35.910> ps3<00:05:36.330> is<00:05:36.389> Bluetooth<00:05:36.720> capable

00:05:37.969 --> 00:05:37.979 
because the ps3 is Bluetooth capable

00:05:37.979 --> 00:05:41.659 
because the ps3 is Bluetooth capable
maybe<00:05:38.460> the<00:05:39.680> somebody<00:05:40.680> doesn't<00:05:41.160> share<00:05:41.490> that

00:05:41.659 --> 00:05:41.669 
maybe the somebody doesn't share that

00:05:41.669 --> 00:05:42.710 
maybe the somebody doesn't share that
with<00:05:41.760> other<00:05:41.910> companies<00:05:42.150> or<00:05:42.419> something<00:05:42.630> like

00:05:42.710 --> 00:05:42.720 
with other companies or something like

00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:46.159 
with other companies or something like
Microsoft<00:05:42.870> ID<00:05:43.560> a--<00:05:44.599> and<00:05:45.599> it<00:05:45.720> looks<00:05:45.900> like<00:05:46.050> we

00:05:46.159 --> 00:05:46.169 
Microsoft ID a-- and it looks like we

00:05:46.169 --> 00:05:49.969

sure<00:05:50.190> what<00:05:50.550> these<00:05:50.760> are<00:05:50.820> for<00:05:51.300> I'm<00:05:52.229> assuming

00:05:52.580 --> 00:05:52.590 
sure what these are for I'm assuming
