aluminum all the way around and I wanted
to<00:01:13.020> note<00:01:13.380> real<00:01:13.710> quick<00:01:13.979> before<00:01:14.190> I<00:01:14.729> end<00:01:15.299> this

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
to note real quick before I end this

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:19.039 
to note real quick before I end this
video<00:01:15.570> that<00:01:15.960> the<00:01:15.990> mouth<00:01:16.350> is<00:01:17.630> cast<00:01:18.630> as<00:01:18.870> one

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:19.049 
video that the mouth is cast as one

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:21.530 
video that the mouth is cast as one
piece<00:01:19.350> with<00:01:19.590> the<00:01:19.710> face<00:01:19.950> and<00:01:20.250> if<00:01:21.030> you<00:01:21.120> wanted<00:01:21.480> to

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540 
piece with the face and if you wanted to

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:23.440 
piece with the face and if you wanted to
articulate<00:01:22.170> the<00:01:22.320> mouth<00:01:22.470> you<00:01:22.650> actually<00:01:22.980> could

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:23.450 
articulate the mouth you actually could

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:27.410 
articulate the mouth you actually could
you'd<00:01:24.450> have<00:01:24.570> to<00:01:24.720> split<00:01:25.280> this<00:01:26.280> mouth<00:01:26.580> around

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420 
you'd have to split this mouth around

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:30.260 
you'd have to split this mouth around
the<00:01:27.630> teeth<00:01:27.840> line<00:01:28.140> and<00:01:28.500> then<00:01:28.680> engineer<00:01:29.250> a<00:01:29.550> clamp

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
the teeth line and then engineer a clamp

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:32.530 
the teeth line and then engineer a clamp
a<00:01:30.540> spring-loaded<00:01:31.260> clamp<00:01:31.710> that<00:01:31.860> would<00:01:32.100> attach

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:32.540 
a spring-loaded clamp that would attach

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:34.640 
a spring-loaded clamp that would attach
that<00:01:33.540> you<00:01:33.630> could<00:01:33.750> operate<00:01:33.990> with<00:01:34.320> your<00:01:34.530> own

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:34.650 
that you could operate with your own

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:36.980 
that you could operate with your own
mouth<00:01:34.860> to<00:01:35.370> open<00:01:35.400> a<00:01:35.670> closed<00:01:35.850> so<00:01:36.510> this<00:01:36.840> is

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
mouth to open a closed so this is

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:41.150 
mouth to open a closed so this is
actually<00:01:37.380> very<00:01:37.650> posable<00:01:39.590> if<00:01:40.590> you<00:01:40.830> had<00:01:40.980> some

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:41.160 
actually very posable if you had some

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:43.010 
actually very posable if you had some
ingenuity<00:01:41.490> and<00:01:41.820> here's<00:01:42.420> the<00:01:42.600> Nemesis

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
ingenuity and here's the Nemesis

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:45.980 
ingenuity and here's the Nemesis
shoulder<00:01:43.410> again<00:01:43.920> it's<00:01:44.730> it's<00:01:45.390> a<00:01:45.570> silicone

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:45.990 
shoulder again it's it's a silicone

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:49.610 
shoulder again it's it's a silicone

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
foam strong enough to maintain its shape

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:54.650 
foam strong enough to maintain its shape
