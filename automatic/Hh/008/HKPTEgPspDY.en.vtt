00:00:00.580 --> 00:00:07.089
 today in how it is done we are going to perform 

00:00:03.690 --> 00:00:09.849
 whipped cream let's see how to learn to 

00:00:07.089 --> 00:00:11.320
 do it in an easy simple way what 

00:00:09.849 --> 00:00:13.599
 first we need is an accessory of 

00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:16.240
 stainless steel the cream has to be 

00:00:13.599 --> 00:00:17.980
 very cold liquid cream and sugar we're going 

00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:19.359
 to do with an electric mixer 

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:21.820
 rods but you can also do 

00:00:19.359 --> 00:00:24.789
 hand, the first thing we do is pour the 

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:27.300
 very cold cream I keep saying it's the 

00:00:24.789 --> 00:00:30.620
 primordial so that it comes out well mounted 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:33.470
 it's the special trick 

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:37.010
 in a stainless steel bowl so that 

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:38.630
 keep that cold from the fridge in the 

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:41.420
 plastic heats up more or in a 

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:45.600
 glass container 

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:47.930
 we spill the cream and if we go 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:51.690
 to do by hand is the same procedure 

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:53.960
 but if we have accessory with blender 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:57.180
 Electric is faster and more comfortable 

00:00:53.960 --> 00:01:02.940
 we started to beat with a very speed 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:05.580
 go down to 1 2 or 3 if it is numbered 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:07.619
 and we do not add the sugar of moments 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:10.920
 until we have a plate beating 

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:12.840
 and see that it is becoming denser 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:15.030
 heal and add a little bit to the 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:17.340
 sugar but not all 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:19.860
 in this case as they are 100 grams we have 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:22.229
 added half about now and 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:25.500
 we keep beating non-stop until it 

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:27.259
 go denser and leave 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:30.930
 we are noticing that it is taking texture 

00:01:27.259 --> 00:01:35.190
 Once the body gets the cream 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:38.310
 start to take body we will add the 

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:42.020
 remaining sugar but we will also 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:45.950
 slowly 

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:48.259
 and we will continue beating little by little and so 

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:51.159
 we will see that our cream is mounted without 

00:01:48.259 --> 00:01:54.979
 problem to see how it is taking body 

00:01:51.159 --> 00:01:56.659
 it is hardening and we will have a cream 

00:01:54.979 --> 00:01:58.219
 great for desserts I'm going to 

00:01:56.659 --> 00:01:59.960
 use here we stop but if it's for 

00:01:58.219 --> 00:02:01.700
 fillings you can add a little bit of 

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:04.119
 gelatin to make powder so that it 

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:06.740
 make harder there you have the whipped cream 

00:02:04.119 --> 00:02:08.599
 the ingredients and I hope that I have 

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:11.709
 liked this tutorial and you write to 

00:02:08.599 --> 00:02:11.709
