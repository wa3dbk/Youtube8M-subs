these I think they still make them I've

00:05:25.930 --> 00:05:30.810 
these I think they still make them I've
had<00:05:26.560> these<00:05:27.750> for<00:05:28.750> again<00:05:29.200> three<00:05:29.470> years<00:05:29.710> and<00:05:30.070> they

really<00:06:00.789> remember<00:06:01.000> where<00:06:01.330> i<00:06:01.389> go<00:06:01.539> from<00:06:01.840> but

00:06:02.670 --> 00:06:02.680 
really remember where i go from but

00:06:02.680 --> 00:06:05.129 
really remember where i go from but
either<00:06:02.919> just<00:06:03.190> a<00:06:03.630> simple<00:06:04.630> leather<00:06:04.810> that<00:06:05.080> I

00:06:05.129 --> 00:06:05.139 
either just a simple leather that I

00:06:05.139 --> 00:06:06.960 
either just a simple leather that I
needed<00:06:05.650> to<00:06:05.740> wear<00:06:05.919> other<00:06:06.100> pants<00:06:06.400> for<00:06:06.639> the<00:06:06.669> drag

00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:06.970 
needed to wear other pants for the drag

00:06:06.970 --> 00:06:11.029 
needed to wear other pants for the drag
strip<00:06:07.410> so<00:06:08.410> that's<00:06:09.010> why<00:06:09.220> I<00:06:09.250> got<00:06:09.520> those

00:06:11.029 --> 00:06:11.039 
strip so that's why I got those

00:06:11.039 --> 00:06:14.369 
strip so that's why I got those
and<00:06:12.039> they're<00:06:12.879> I<00:06:13.120> mean<00:06:13.539> they're<00:06:13.689> comfortable

00:06:14.369 --> 00:06:14.379 
and they're I mean they're comfortable

00:06:14.379 --> 00:06:17.939 
and they're I mean they're comfortable
and<00:06:14.650> I<00:06:15.639> think<00:06:15.879> they<00:06:16.030> would<00:06:16.210> hold<00:06:16.780> up<00:06:17.020> fairly

00:06:17.939 --> 00:06:17.949 
and I think they would hold up fairly

00:06:17.949 --> 00:06:20.999 
and I think they would hold up fairly
well<00:06:18.189> I<00:06:18.610> went<00:06:19.150> down<00:06:19.319> it's<00:06:20.319> not<00:06:20.500> like<00:06:20.680> it's<00:06:20.860> high

00:06:20.999 --> 00:06:21.009 
well I went down it's not like it's high

00:06:21.009 --> 00:06:23.159 
well I went down it's not like it's high
quality<00:06:21.039> leathers<00:06:21.669> my<00:06:21.849> jacket<00:06:22.300> but<00:06:22.479> it<00:06:23.050> would

00:06:23.159 --> 00:06:23.169 
quality leathers my jacket but it would

00:06:23.169 --> 00:06:28.260 
quality leathers my jacket but it would
work<00:06:26.490> and<00:06:27.490> then<00:06:27.610> for<00:06:27.729> those<00:06:27.849> of<00:06:28.030> you<00:06:28.120> that

00:06:28.260 --> 00:06:28.270 
work and then for those of you that

00:06:28.270 --> 00:06:29.909 
work and then for those of you that
don't<00:06:28.449> know<00:06:28.569> this<00:06:28.900> is<00:06:29.050> the<00:06:29.169> camera<00:06:29.500> that<00:06:29.530> i<00:06:29.680> use

don't know this is the camera that i use
for<00:06:30.219> my<00:06:30.490> motovlogs<00:06:31.139> lets<00:06:32.139> it<00:06:32.259> drift<00:06:32.560> HD<00:06:33.000> 170<00:06:34.000> I

00:06:34.969 --> 00:06:34.979 
for my motovlogs lets it drift HD 170 I

00:06:34.979 --> 00:06:39.450 
for my motovlogs lets it drift HD 170 I
have<00:06:35.979> the<00:06:36.189> big<00:06:36.370> battery<00:06:36.729> pack<00:06:36.969> in<00:06:37.270> it<00:06:37.419> and<00:06:38.460> the

00:06:39.450 --> 00:06:39.460 
have the big battery pack in it and the

00:06:39.460 --> 00:06:42.390 
have the big battery pack in it and the
lens<00:06:40.060> rotates<00:06:40.599> 170<00:06:41.560> degrees<00:06:41.830> that's<00:06:42.129> why<00:06:42.280> they

00:06:42.390 --> 00:06:42.400 
lens rotates 170 degrees that's why they

00:06:42.400 --> 00:06:54.310 
lens rotates 170 degrees that's why they
call<00:06:42.610> it<00:06:42.639> the<00:06:42.789> 170<00:06:43.949> so<00:06:45.719> as<00:06:47.639> actually<00:06:48.639> guess

00:06:54.310 --> 00:06:54.320 

00:06:54.320 --> 00:06:57.340 

it<00:06:54.890> has<00:06:55.070> a<00:06:55.100> view<00:06:55.370> screen<00:06:55.730> as<00:06:55.940> most<00:06:56.510> drift

00:06:57.340 --> 00:06:57.350 
it has a view screen as most drift

00:06:57.350 --> 00:07:04.900 
it has a view screen as most drift
cameras<00:06:58.250> do<00:07:01.990> it's<00:07:02.990> easy<00:07:03.230> to<00:07:03.410> operate<00:07:03.500> I<00:07:04.190> like
