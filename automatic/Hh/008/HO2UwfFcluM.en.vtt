hands we then place the letters in an
upright<00:00:27.000> position<00:00:27.030> and<00:00:27.900> by<00:00:28.500> using<00:00:28.860> time-lapse

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:29.160 
upright position and by using time-lapse

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:32.810 
upright position and by using time-lapse
photography<00:00:29.720> got<00:00:30.720> this<00:00:30.869> result<00:00:31.129> just<00:00:32.129> focus

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:32.820 
photography got this result just focus

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:41.630 
photography got this result just focus
on<00:00:33.030> the<00:00:33.210> middle<00:00:33.510> of<00:00:33.719> the<00:00:34.079> lettuce

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:41.640 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:46.760 

you

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:46.770 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:48.990 

we<00:00:47.770> then<00:00:47.950> took<00:00:48.100> a<00:00:48.250> head<00:00:48.399> of<00:00:48.520> iceberg<00:00:48.730> lettuce

00:00:48.990 --> 00:00:49.000 
we then took a head of iceberg lettuce

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.960 
we then took a head of iceberg lettuce
and<00:00:49.600> chopped<00:00:50.350> up<00:00:50.559> most<00:00:50.860> of<00:00:51.040> it<00:00:51.160> and<00:00:51.340> placed<00:00:51.820> it

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:51.970 
and chopped up most of it and placed it

00:00:51.970 --> 00:01:04.100 
and chopped up most of it and placed it
in<00:00:52.059> to<00:00:52.329> sow<00:00:52.600> the<00:00:52.660> dishes

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:06.110 

we<00:01:04.680> then<00:01:04.860> rinsed<00:01:05.220> the<00:01:05.340> salad<00:01:05.670> bowl<00:01:05.790> on<00:01:06.000> the

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:06.120 
we then rinsed the salad bowl on the

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:08.330 
we then rinsed the salad bowl on the
left<00:01:06.390> and<00:01:06.720> O's<00:01:06.900> needed<00:01:07.260> water<00:01:07.440> from<00:01:07.890> the<00:01:07.980> eco

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 
left and O's needed water from the eco

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:10.670 
left and O's needed water from the eco
safe<00:01:08.550> system<00:01:08.940> ozone<00:01:09.330> machine<00:01:09.690> for<00:01:09.900> about<00:01:10.050> 20

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 
safe system ozone machine for about 20

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:18.410 
safe system ozone machine for about 20
seconds<00:01:16.130> we<00:01:17.130> then<00:01:17.310> place<00:01:17.490> them<00:01:17.790> side<00:01:18.150> by<00:01:18.180> side

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
seconds we then place them side by side

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:21.500 
seconds we then place them side by side
and<00:01:19.400> again<00:01:20.400> by<00:01:20.730> using<00:01:21.150> time-lapse

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:21.510 
and again by using time-lapse

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:31.170 
and again by using time-lapse
photography<00:01:22.400> got<00:01:23.400> this<00:01:23.580> result

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:31.180 

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:39.700 

let's<00:01:32.180> look<00:01:32.600> at<00:01:32.720> that<00:01:32.900> again

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:39.710 

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:42.260 

it's<00:01:40.710> pretty<00:01:41.100> obvious<00:01:41.580> that<00:01:41.610> the<00:01:41.880> salad<00:01:42.210> on

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
it's pretty obvious that the salad on

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:44.150 
it's pretty obvious that the salad on
the<00:01:42.420> left<00:01:42.630> looks<00:01:42.900> much<00:01:43.200> better<00:01:43.590> and<00:01:43.920> is

00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:44.160 
the left looks much better and is

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:46.130 
the left looks much better and is
germ-free<00:01:44.570> because<00:01:45.570> it<00:01:45.690> was<00:01:45.810> rinsed<00:01:45.990> and

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140 
germ-free because it was rinsed and

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:47.990 
germ-free because it was rinsed and
ozonated<00:01:46.590> water<00:01:46.710> it<00:01:47.160> is<00:01:47.280> still<00:01:47.520> totally

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:48.000 
ozonated water it is still totally

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:49.880 
ozonated water it is still totally
organic<00:01:48.300> and<00:01:48.660> tastes<00:01:48.990> better<00:01:49.170> because<00:01:49.560> it<00:01:49.710> has

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
organic and tastes better because it has

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:57.760 
organic and tastes better because it has
no<00:01:50.160> chlorine

00:01:57.760 --> 00:01:57.770 

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:01.670 

we<00:01:58.770> then<00:01:58.950> to<00:01:59.100> expand<00:01:59.400> it<00:01:59.580> and<00:02:00.110> wash<00:02:01.110> it<00:02:01.140> in<00:02:01.470> a

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:01.680 
we then to expand it and wash it in a

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:11.660 
we then to expand it and wash it in a
zone<00:02:01.890> water<00:02:02.160> for<00:02:02.580> 10<00:02:02.820> seconds<00:02:09.560> and<00:02:10.670> with

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:11.670 
zone water for 10 seconds and with

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:22.990 
zone water for 10 seconds and with
time-lapse<00:02:12.300> photography<00:02:12.860> got<00:02:13.860> this<00:02:14.040> result

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:23.000 

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:29.570 

let's<00:02:24.000> look<00:02:24.420> at<00:02:24.540> that<00:02:24.660> again<00:02:27.950> this<00:02:28.950> is<00:02:29.160> before

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:29.580 
let's look at that again this is before

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:35.910 
let's look at that again this is before
and<00:02:30.450> this<00:02:31.140> is<00:02:31.200> after
