thinner than the sort of quality of the
beginners<00:01:22.860> hand<00:01:23.070> but<00:01:23.220> we<00:01:23.310> looked<00:01:23.460> at<00:01:23.580> earlier

00:01:24.429 --> 00:01:24.439 
beginners hand but we looked at earlier

00:01:24.439 --> 00:01:26.780

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
introduction so I think their

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:30.020

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990 
sort of need neither overview of what

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:36.010

take these sorts of books into the

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:26.029 
take these sorts of books into the
toilet<00:04:24.000> and<00:04:24.180> get<00:04:25.169> stuck<00:04:25.229> in<00:04:25.530> there<00:04:25.650> for<00:04:25.830> hours

00:04:26.029 --> 00:04:26.039 
toilet and get stuck in there for hours

00:04:26.039 --> 00:04:27.330 
toilet and get stuck in there for hours
and<00:04:26.099> we're<00:04:26.219> like<00:04:26.340> come<00:04:26.460> on

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:27.340 
and we're like come on

00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:29.730 
and we're like come on
we<00:04:27.400> need<00:04:27.790> to<00:04:27.880> go<00:04:28.030> but<00:04:28.419> he's<00:04:28.570> there<00:04:28.810> on<00:04:29.199> the<00:04:29.590> loo

00:04:29.730 --> 00:04:29.740 
we need to go but he's there on the loo

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:31.350 
we need to go but he's there on the loo
reading<00:04:30.190> his<00:04:30.310> book<00:04:30.520> so<00:04:30.639> I<00:04:30.669> think<00:04:30.970> he'll

00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:31.360 
reading his book so I think he'll

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:33.000

probably<00:04:31.449> quite<00:04:31.750> enjoy<00:04:32.110> it<00:04:32.260> and<00:04:32.410> does<00:04:32.980> a

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:33.010 
probably quite enjoy it and does a

00:04:33.010 --> 00:04:35.280 
probably quite enjoy it and does a
