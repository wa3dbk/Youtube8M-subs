00:00:01.550 --> 00:00:10.050
 and we are here directly from the 

00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:15.059
 stadium of Corinthians Arena on the 2nd of 

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:18.420
 June 2013 turning right which is the last 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:20.820
 The visit we had was on the 31st 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:23.730
 December 2012 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:24.390
 It's just me and mine today. 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:27.660
 cousin nÃ© 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:29.939
 josemar and and my father's visit in 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:31.410
 first time he comes here in the arena 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:35.219
 corinthians 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:37.950
 rain is a cool rain ride 

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:39.690
 has a little messed up but who likes 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:42.200
 music with this thing can not 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:42.200
 to abandon 

00:00:44.300 --> 00:01:15.360
 I see with great joy our future 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:01:21.540
 home and that you think I know everyone, right? 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:25.490
 but is you think the difference fell here 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:29.720
 on December 31 a year ago pro 

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:32.040
 practically six months of change and 

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:36.090
 Finding the difference here has changed a lot 

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:38.729
 thing did not have this side was not even 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:43.110
 my grandstand coverage is already 

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:44.640
 almost ready already gives to and fro the 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:54.390
 stadium even with us you see that there is no 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:57.630
 We do not even want to 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:58.680
 Talk because there's huge joy here. 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:00.659
 O 

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:05.479
 nor that one is in the house of tereza that a 

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:05.479
 game which will be wonderful here 

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:12.880
 so I have to say that I liked the 

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:22.000
 visit despite the rain has disturbed 

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:23.440
 a little bit but the desire to end your 

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.700
 work 

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:28.450
 Too bad we can not go in there. 

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:32.010
 in some countries but right here place 

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:32.010
 was on the new visit 

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:46.240
 My father is here with us are there 

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:50.620
 with happiness and health tac set with 

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:51.370
 You're a pleasure, so here it is, the house. 

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:55.150
 from corinthians 

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:57.640
 the house that nobody thought of 

00:02:55.150 --> 00:03:00.850
 corinthians reach that moment so 

00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:05.050
 that many of them do not 

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:08.470
 I believed but one day I thought I was going to 

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:10.690
 find no's there for everyone to see the 

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:16.690
 I will not speak to Corinthians Stadium. 

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:19.260
 Are you ready to learn how to play for a long time? 

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:22.860

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:22.860
