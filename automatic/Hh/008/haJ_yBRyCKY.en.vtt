00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
in English in Japan is still undecided

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:49.690 
in English in Japan is still undecided
but<00:00:47.219> it<00:00:47.370> seems<00:00:47.789> to<00:00:47.940> be<00:00:48.300> held<00:00:48.750> for<00:00:49.110> now<00:00:49.289> as

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:49.700 
but it seems to be held for now as

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:53.389 
but it seems to be held for now as
Hyrule<00:00:50.700> warriors<00:00:50.730> which<00:00:51.539> is<00:00:51.870> bouquet<00:00:52.829> I<00:00:53.129> mean

I<00:00:53.489> think<00:00:53.600> Zelda<00:00:54.600> warriors<00:00:55.079> is<00:00:55.350> a<00:00:55.410> little<00:00:55.829> more

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
I think Zelda warriors is a little more

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:58.310 
I think Zelda warriors is a little more
fitting<00:00:56.460> personally<00:00:57.120> especially<00:00:58.109> because

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
fitting personally especially because

00:00:58.320 --> 00:00:59.660 
fitting personally especially because
some<00:00:58.500> people<00:00:58.770> might<00:00:58.949> not<00:00:59.190> make<00:00:59.399> that

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
some people might not make that

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:02.389 
some people might not make that
connection<00:01:00.000> between<00:01:00.449> high<00:01:00.840> roll<00:01:01.109> I<00:01:01.399> really

wouldn't<00:01:02.670> know<00:01:02.760> why<00:01:03.059> but<00:01:03.570> I'm<00:01:03.780> not<00:01:03.930> zelda<00:01:04.170> fan

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500
