could start to win some games so yeah

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:51.050 
could start to win some games so yeah
then<00:02:50.070> of<00:02:50.160> course<00:02:50.310> you<00:02:50.400> got<00:02:50.520> to<00:02:50.610> throw<00:02:50.730> in<00:02:50.850> Brian

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:51.060 
then of course you got to throw in Brian

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:54.199 
then of course you got to throw in Brian
Johnson<00:02:52.010> he's<00:02:53.010> really<00:02:53.550> doesn't<00:02:53.880> compare<00:02:54.180> to

00:02:54.199 --> 00:02:54.209 
Johnson he's really doesn't compare to

00:02:54.209 --> 00:02:55.910 
Johnson he's really doesn't compare to
those<00:02:54.390> two<00:02:54.720> but<00:02:54.930> he's<00:02:55.110> one<00:02:55.350> of<00:02:55.440> the<00:02:55.530> best<00:02:55.680> slot

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:55.920 
those two but he's one of the best slot

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:57.770 
those two but he's one of the best slot
receivers<00:02:56.400> in<00:02:56.520> the<00:02:56.610> game<00:02:56.820> though<00:02:57.600> I'm<00:02:57.720> sure

00:02:57.770 --> 00:02:57.780 
receivers in the game though I'm sure

00:02:57.780 --> 00:02:59.240 
receivers in the game though I'm sure
they're<00:02:58.080> regretting<00:02:58.500> that<00:02:58.590> draft<00:02:58.890> pick<00:02:59.100> right

00:02:59.240 --> 00:02:59.250 
they're regretting that draft pick right

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:03.979 
they're regretting that draft pick right
about<00:02:59.430> now<00:02:59.640> but<00:03:01.100> all<00:03:02.100> right<00:03:02.420> who<00:03:03.420> is<00:03:03.750> better

00:03:03.979 --> 00:03:03.989 
about now but all right who is better

00:03:03.989 --> 00:03:06.590 
about now but all right who is better
Anquan<00:03:04.890> Boldin<00:03:04.920> or<00:03:05.340> larry<00:03:05.520> fitzgerald<00:03:06.150> it's<00:03:06.330> a

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:06.600 
Anquan Boldin or larry fitzgerald it's a

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:13.400 
Anquan Boldin or larry fitzgerald it's a
never<00:03:07.440> ending<00:03:07.560> debate<00:03:08.160> really<00:03:11.660> well<00:03:12.660> when<00:03:13.170> one

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:13.410 
never ending debate really well when one

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:16.520 
never ending debate really well when one
on<00:03:13.590> one<00:03:13.800> hand<00:03:14.070> yeah<00:03:14.250> Bolden<00:03:14.760> and<00:03:15.020> he<00:03:16.020> overcomes

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:16.530 
on one hand yeah Bolden and he overcomes

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:21.380 
on one hand yeah Bolden and he overcomes
his<00:03:17.540> fairly<00:03:18.540> slow<00:03:18.870> speed<00:03:19.820> because<00:03:20.820> he<00:03:21.180> can

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:21.390 
his fairly slow speed because he can

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:23.690 
his fairly slow speed because he can
break<00:03:21.600> tackles<00:03:21.660> he's<00:03:22.530> one<00:03:22.769> of<00:03:22.890> those<00:03:22.950> rare

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:23.700 
break tackles he's one of those rare

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:25.880 
break tackles he's one of those rare
wide<00:03:24.269> receivers<00:03:24.900> out<00:03:25.019> there<00:03:25.290> that<00:03:25.470> knows<00:03:25.680> how

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:25.890 
wide receivers out there that knows how

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:30.229 
wide receivers out there that knows how
to<00:03:25.950> break<00:03:26.190> tackles<00:03:26.459> uh<00:03:28.820> when<00:03:29.820> I<00:03:29.850> think<00:03:30.150> about

00:03:30.229 --> 00:03:30.239 
to break tackles uh when I think about

00:03:30.239 --> 00:03:32.000 
to break tackles uh when I think about
receivers<00:03:31.080> that<00:03:31.230> are<00:03:31.320> known<00:03:31.470> for<00:03:31.650> being<00:03:31.769> able

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:32.010 
receivers that are known for being able

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:34.190 
receivers that are known for being able
to<00:03:32.070> break<00:03:32.250> tackles<00:03:32.459> I<00:03:33.060> think<00:03:33.360> Michael<00:03:33.840> Irvin

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:34.200 
to break tackles I think Michael Irvin

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:37.550 
to break tackles I think Michael Irvin
Terrell<00:03:35.070> Owens<00:03:35.220> and<00:03:35.760> anquan<00:03:36.360> boldin<00:03:36.560> there

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:37.560 
Terrell Owens and anquan boldin there

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:39.650 
Terrell Owens and anquan boldin there
might<00:03:37.739> be<00:03:37.769> others<00:03:38.130> but<00:03:38.160> those<00:03:38.850> are<00:03:39.180> the<00:03:39.510> those

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:39.660 
might be others but those are the those

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:42.050 
might be others but those are the those
are<00:03:39.840> the<00:03:40.019> three<00:03:40.470> that<00:03:41.280> come<00:03:41.459> readily<00:03:41.760> to<00:03:41.940> mind

00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:42.060 
are the three that come readily to mind

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:44.690 
are the three that come readily to mind
that<00:03:42.570> shows<00:03:42.780> you<00:03:42.840> how<00:03:42.930> special<00:03:43.260> a<00:03:43.829> tackle

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:44.700 
that shows you how special a tackle

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:46.729 
that shows you how special a tackle
breaking<00:03:45.000> wide<00:03:45.180> receiver<00:03:45.660> is<00:03:45.840> and<00:03:46.230> boldin<00:03:46.680> is

00:03:46.729 --> 00:03:46.739 
breaking wide receiver is and boldin is

00:03:46.739 --> 00:03:48.590 
breaking wide receiver is and boldin is
one<00:03:46.860> of<00:03:46.950> those<00:03:47.070> guys<00:03:47.250> who<00:03:47.310> can<00:03:47.640> just<00:03:47.880> plow

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:48.600 
one of those guys who can just plow

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:51.050 
one of those guys who can just plow
through<00:03:48.630> people<00:03:49.320> throw<00:03:50.130> him<00:03:50.340> off<00:03:50.519> him<00:03:50.760> you

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:51.060 
through people throw him off him you

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:54.530 
through people throw him off him you
know<00:03:51.480> he's<00:03:51.690> built<00:03:52.110> that<00:03:52.440> way<00:03:52.910> so<00:03:53.910> he'll<00:03:54.120> catch

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:54.540 
know he's built that way so he'll catch

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:56.300 
know he's built that way so he'll catch
a<00:03:54.660> lot<00:03:54.750> of<00:03:54.810> short<00:03:55.110> passes<00:03:55.620> then<00:03:55.920> just<00:03:56.190> get

00:03:56.300 --> 00:03:56.310 
a lot of short passes then just get

00:03:56.310 --> 00:03:57.590 
a lot of short passes then just get
yards<00:03:56.640> after<00:03:56.790> the<00:03:56.910> catch<00:03:57.000> back<00:03:57.390> breaking

00:03:57.590 --> 00:03:57.600 
yards after the catch back breaking

00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:00.860 
yards after the catch back breaking
tackles<00:03:58.070> he's<00:03:59.070> the<00:03:59.430> second<00:03:59.940> best<00:03:59.970> yard<00:04:00.690> after

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:00.870 
tackles he's the second best yard after

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:04.160 
tackles he's the second best yard after
the<00:04:01.790> yard<00:04:02.790> after<00:04:02.970> the<00:04:03.180> catch<00:04:03.329> receiver<00:04:03.810> after

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:04.170 
the yard after the catch receiver after

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:07.759 
the yard after the catch receiver after
tio<00:04:04.380> probably<00:04:05.130> in<00:04:05.250> the<00:04:05.340> league<00:04:06.410> so<00:04:07.410> he<00:04:07.440> has<00:04:07.739> a

00:04:07.759 --> 00:04:07.769 
tio probably in the league so he has a

00:04:07.769 --> 00:04:12.020 
tio probably in the league so he has a
rare<00:04:08.130> skill<00:04:08.760> set<00:04:09.090> so<00:04:10.610> that's<00:04:11.610> definitely<00:04:11.820> a

00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:12.030 
rare skill set so that's definitely a

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:14.390 
rare skill set so that's definitely a
plus<00:04:12.209> in<00:04:12.420> his<00:04:12.540> direction<00:04:12.890> Fitzgerald<00:04:13.890> is

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:14.400 
plus in his direction Fitzgerald is

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:17.900 
plus in his direction Fitzgerald is
harder<00:04:14.820> to<00:04:14.850> define<00:04:15.739> he<00:04:16.739> doesn't<00:04:17.250> have<00:04:17.400> amazing

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:17.910 
harder to define he doesn't have amazing

00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:19.490 
harder to define he doesn't have amazing

a<00:04:36.540> possession<00:04:36.930> receiver<00:04:37.140> or<00:04:37.890> a<00:04:38.030> speed

a possession receiver or a speed

00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:41.570 
a possession receiver or a speed
receiver<00:04:39.450> or<00:04:39.900> a<00:04:40.040> yard<00:04:41.040> after<00:04:41.160> the<00:04:41.400> catch

receiver<00:04:42.000> nothing<00:04:42.330> like<00:04:42.480> that<00:04:43.430> really<00:04:44.430> I

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:44.610 
receiver nothing like that really I

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:46.520 
receiver nothing like that really I
think<00:04:44.850> he<00:04:44.940> compares<00:04:45.300> to<00:04:45.540> Jerry<00:04:45.870> Rice<00:04:46.140> in<00:04:46.410> the

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:46.530 
think he compares to Jerry Rice in the

00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:49.250 
think he compares to Jerry Rice in the
sense<00:04:46.740> that<00:04:46.830> Jerry<00:04:47.790> Rice<00:04:48.060> didn't<00:04:48.390> really<00:04:48.690> fit

00:04:49.250 --> 00:04:49.260 
sense that Jerry Rice didn't really fit

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:51.020 
sense that Jerry Rice didn't really fit
into<00:04:49.440> any<00:04:49.680> of<00:04:49.800> those<00:04:49.950> categories<00:04:50.010> because<00:04:50.730> he

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:51.030 
into any of those categories because he

00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:52.550 
into any of those categories because he
was<00:04:51.180> a<00:04:51.210> great<00:04:51.510> all-around<00:04:51.720> receiver<00:04:52.440> who

00:04:52.550 --> 00:04:52.560 
was a great all-around receiver who

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:54.680 
was a great all-around receiver who
could<00:04:52.710> go<00:04:52.890> pretty<00:04:53.700> much<00:04:53.850> anywhere<00:04:53.970> you<00:04:54.420> wanted

00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:54.690 
could go pretty much anywhere you wanted

00:04:54.690 --> 00:04:56.780 
could go pretty much anywhere you wanted
him<00:04:54.840> to<00:04:54.990> and<00:04:55.200> do<00:04:55.260> whatever<00:04:55.440> you<00:04:56.130> wanted<00:04:56.400> him<00:04:56.580> to

00:04:56.780 --> 00:04:56.790 
him to and do whatever you wanted him to

00:04:56.790 --> 00:05:00.800 
him to and do whatever you wanted him to
do<00:04:56.910> in<00:04:57.090> terms<00:04:57.240> of<00:04:57.450> catching<00:04:57.870> the<00:04:57.960> ball<00:04:58.110> so<00:04:59.810> Fitz

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:00.810 
do in terms of catching the ball so Fitz

00:05:00.810 --> 00:05:02.420 
do in terms of catching the ball so Fitz
doesn't<00:05:01.260> really<00:05:01.410> fit<00:05:01.650> into<00:05:01.740> a<00:05:01.800> category<00:05:02.160> he's

00:05:02.420 --> 00:05:02.430 
doesn't really fit into a category he's

00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:06.050 
doesn't really fit into a category he's
just<00:05:02.610> a<00:05:02.700> great<00:05:02.820> all-around<00:05:03.090> player<00:05:04.160> so<00:05:05.160> that

00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:06.060 
just a great all-around player so that

00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:10.550 
just a great all-around player so that
said<00:05:06.450> who<00:05:07.410> would<00:05:07.500> I<00:05:07.590> rather<00:05:07.740> have<00:05:09.230> well<00:05:10.230> I'll

00:05:10.550 --> 00:05:10.560 
said who would I rather have well I'll

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:13.100 
said who would I rather have well I'll
divide<00:05:11.430> that<00:05:11.550> up<00:05:11.610> into<00:05:11.820> two<00:05:12.000> questions<00:05:12.420> oldin

00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:13.110 
divide that up into two questions oldin

00:05:13.110 --> 00:05:15.350 
divide that up into two questions oldin
is<00:05:13.230> the<00:05:13.350> better<00:05:13.500> player<00:05:13.800> I<00:05:14.040> think<00:05:14.790> Bolden<00:05:15.120> is

00:05:15.350 --> 00:05:15.360 
is the better player I think Bolden is

00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:18.100 
is the better player I think Bolden is
the<00:05:15.540> better<00:05:15.720> player<00:05:15.990> because<00:05:16.500> he<00:05:16.770> brings<00:05:17.250> the

00:05:18.100 --> 00:05:18.110 
the better player because he brings the

00:05:18.110 --> 00:05:21.500 
the better player because he brings the
yard<00:05:19.110> after<00:05:19.260> the<00:05:19.440> catch<00:05:19.620> ability<00:05:20.100> that<00:05:21.090> is<00:05:21.270> so

00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:21.510 
yard after the catch ability that is so

00:05:21.510 --> 00:05:23.030 
yard after the catch ability that is so
rare<00:05:21.780> in<00:05:21.930> this<00:05:22.050> league<00:05:22.290> at<00:05:22.440> the<00:05:22.530> wide<00:05:22.680> receiver

00:05:23.030 --> 00:05:23.040 
rare in this league at the wide receiver

00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:27.020 
rare in this league at the wide receiver
position<00:05:23.390> like<00:05:24.390> I<00:05:24.510> said<00:05:25.760> receivers<00:05:26.760> in<00:05:26.910> this

00:05:27.020 --> 00:05:27.030 
position like I said receivers in this

00:05:27.030 --> 00:05:27.890

league<00:05:27.240> who<00:05:27.390> are<00:05:27.480> known<00:05:27.630> for<00:05:27.780> breaking

00:05:27.890 --> 00:05:27.900 
league who are known for breaking

00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:33.260

tackles tio and anquan boldin so you

00:05:33.270 --> 00:05:35.330

00:05:35.330 --> 00:05:35.340
