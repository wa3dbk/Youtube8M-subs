00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:48.380 
from the law because it's obviously only

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:52.340 
from the law because it's obviously only
restricts<00:01:49.380> us<00:01:49.530> here<00:01:50.189> so<00:01:50.850> in<00:01:51.720> this<00:01:51.869> video<00:01:52.049> it's

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350 
restricts us here so in this video it's

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:54.859 
restricts us here so in this video it's
very<00:01:52.439> similar<00:01:52.860> process<00:01:53.360> than<00:01:54.360> the<00:01:54.390> previous
