00:00:00.649 --> 00:00:05.010
 Hello Guest Welcome to a new lesson ever at the 2009 Tour Account 

00:00:05.010 --> 00:00:09.190
 I will show today about not voting dance so there are two again 

00:00:09.190 --> 00:00:13.749
 Versions a pure we realize that the simplest and all that 

00:00:13.749 --> 00:00:17.499
 Living in the city will show your guitar without quiet spots 

00:00:19.029 --> 00:00:22.480
 let's get to the basics it happened Stevens 

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:25.480
 Guitarist mentioned above written I voted him 

00:00:26.319 --> 00:00:30.619
 Orders results page which determine the report is too deep 

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:34.390
 then she would be counterclockwise Müller 

00:00:35.490 --> 00:00:37.170
 "It's the reconciliatory end 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:41.070
 finally i missed up or digital for a heavy nut 

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:43.790
 if I want to be a page 

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:47.660
 then of course the other side should not bring in and therefore gives 

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:50.660
 with his left hand 

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:53.540
 Sonnenberg II side 

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:58.290
 because the animal species face the subsequent thumb break the titles 

00:00:58.290 --> 00:01:00.740
 this day so I have a child 

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:03.740
 he puts the page down 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:09.150
 I have in addition with the right hand the deep strings from immature in addition 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:12.630
 even with the other fingers of the right hand the pages really grasp that 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:14.680
 this death 

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:17.520
 That is why the other side 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:20.520
 what he sees exactly as it goes many 

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:25.470
 that enough about it in handball hold the front pages so this 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:27.940
 do not play anymore 

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:30.190
 should have a single page 

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:31.520
 one hears 

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:34.520
 around 

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:40.060
 to Nissan with civilization 

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:43.500
 I suggest you do it all 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:47.550
 we look Hausdülmener something happens it would be us right now 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:51.840
 three lights on a-ligist and below 

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:57.230
 but the display still a two years is a slightly older model of coconut 

00:01:57.230 --> 00:02:00.300
 is suitable with guitars 

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:03.300
 now in this case you know where reading tours 

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:05.640
 too high 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:09.539
 it always lights up too high with this lamp it shines too low 

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:12.099
 we have to watch that we are the readers now 

00:02:12.099 --> 00:02:17.079
 pointing to the green light to show that in the middle is something 

00:02:17.079 --> 00:02:20.079
 try it then 

00:02:28.119 --> 00:02:31.119
 if the old one is too high then we have to 

00:02:37.499 --> 00:02:40.499
 This massively caught 

00:02:47.209 --> 00:02:49.849
 In addition, the display shows 

00:02:49.849 --> 00:02:51.429
 right upper corner 

00:02:51.429 --> 00:02:53.109
 as the page is called 

00:02:53.109 --> 00:02:56.829
 in our case Denise Seidel and the number of page 6 

00:03:02.999 --> 00:03:05.319
 in seven years 

00:03:05.319 --> 00:03:08.709
 M spring a-side 

00:03:08.709 --> 00:03:10.819
 Unisys prevail over these grievances 

00:03:10.819 --> 00:03:15.449
 and said nothing to the councilors Cantz this spring, the question was how 

00:03:15.449 --> 00:03:17.019
 he does not work at all 

00:03:17.019 --> 00:03:22.139
 the name the Nissan Jimmy van Buuren 6 different Schönegg people 

00:03:22.139 --> 00:03:24.309
 Marcel Wildhaber fill pages 

00:03:24.309 --> 00:03:26.779
 I war the Michalik 

00:03:26.779 --> 00:03:31.029
 s in a clockwise direction it should be set higher 

00:03:31.029 --> 00:03:33.549
 Mar 

00:03:33.549 --> 00:03:36.549
 Elton 

00:03:38.689 --> 00:03:39.790
 SID 

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:42.790
 next comes the page on it looks good ten 

00:03:44.309 --> 00:03:48.879
 they also have to be too deep because with less against his sense 

00:03:50.799 --> 00:03:53.799
 and then read these pages 

00:03:54.659 --> 00:03:56.300
 and the green light is on 

00:03:56.300 --> 00:03:59.300
 then the next house comes to Donges 

00:03:59.979 --> 00:04:01.429
 that is too high 

00:04:01.429 --> 00:04:05.599
 and we have to turn clockwise again to see you claim now 

00:04:06.509 --> 00:04:09.509
 Sound now 

00:04:13.909 --> 00:04:16.499
 the police are too deep 

00:04:16.499 --> 00:04:18.849
 I think again the deep strings 

00:04:18.849 --> 00:04:21.690
 so she does not swing up 

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:24.690
 Dr 

00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:35.620
 and that's not all 

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:37.520
 Oppenheimer was correct 

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:40.900
 Whatever it takes in the end to rehearse and strengthen the danger 

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:43.900
 really need a proper mood 

00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:53.229
 that's pretty good 

00:04:53.229 --> 00:04:56.110
 I say goodbye for today and Saxon a next lesson
