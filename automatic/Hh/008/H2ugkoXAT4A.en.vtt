hello I've just been doing some footage
of<00:00:03.179> the<00:00:03.300> super<00:00:03.629> moon<00:00:03.780> now<00:00:04.440> I<00:00:04.470> don't<00:00:04.620> know<00:00:04.859> why

00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:05.220 
of the super moon now I don't know why

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:07.519 
of the super moon now I don't know why
it's<00:00:05.520> called<00:00:05.819> the<00:00:06.000> super<00:00:06.150> moon<00:00:06.480> I<00:00:06.810> don't<00:00:07.410> know

00:00:07.519 --> 00:00:07.529 
it's called the super moon I don't know

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:09.560 
it's called the super moon I don't know
there<00:00:07.770> is<00:00:07.980> actually<00:00:08.490> a<00:00:08.519> super<00:00:08.970> moon<00:00:09.090> it's<00:00:09.389> a

00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:09.570 
there is actually a super moon it's a

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:11.780 
there is actually a super moon it's a
it's<00:00:10.110> just<00:00:10.200> a<00:00:10.410> bit<00:00:10.530> bigger<00:00:10.889> than<00:00:11.070> normal<00:00:11.250> in

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:11.790 
it's just a bit bigger than normal in

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:13.999 
it's just a bit bigger than normal in
terms<00:00:12.150> of<00:00:12.300> how<00:00:12.450> we<00:00:12.480> see<00:00:12.870> it<00:00:12.900> I<00:00:13.139> think<00:00:13.469> and<00:00:13.710> it's

00:00:13.999 --> 00:00:14.009 
terms of how we see it I think and it's

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:16.970 
terms of how we see it I think and it's
a<00:00:14.160> bit<00:00:14.280> glowy<00:00:14.730> and<00:00:15.059> brighter<00:00:15.509> and<00:00:15.980> that's

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:16.980 
a bit glowy and brighter and that's

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:19.099 
a bit glowy and brighter and that's
about<00:00:17.130> it<00:00:17.220> it<00:00:17.850> took<00:00:18.090> ages<00:00:18.300> and<00:00:18.600> ages<00:00:18.630> and<00:00:18.930> ages

00:00:19.099 --> 00:00:19.109 
about it it took ages and ages and ages

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:21.050 
about it it took ages and ages and ages
to<00:00:19.560> get<00:00:19.710> anything<00:00:19.980> out<00:00:20.220> of<00:00:20.250> it<00:00:20.430> because<00:00:20.609> I<00:00:20.910> had

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:21.060 
to get anything out of it because I had

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:22.640 
to get anything out of it because I had
to<00:00:21.180> adjust<00:00:21.480> the<00:00:21.630> brightness<00:00:21.810> until<00:00:22.410> I<00:00:22.439> could

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:22.650 
to adjust the brightness until I could

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:24.349 
to adjust the brightness until I could
actually<00:00:22.769> see<00:00:23.070> the<00:00:23.250> moon<00:00:23.430> because<00:00:23.970> otherwise

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:24.359 
actually see the moon because otherwise

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:26.870 
actually see the moon because otherwise
it<00:00:24.630> was<00:00:24.689> just<00:00:24.869> great<00:00:25.080> big<00:00:25.380> sparkly<00:00:26.070> blob<00:00:26.490> in

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:26.880 
it was just great big sparkly blob in

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:28.910 
it was just great big sparkly blob in
the<00:00:27.269> middle<00:00:27.449> of<00:00:27.480> the<00:00:27.570> sky<00:00:27.840> but<00:00:28.470> now<00:00:28.650> I've<00:00:28.769> got

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:28.920 
the middle of the sky but now I've got

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:32.299 
the middle of the sky but now I've got
it<00:00:29.070> and<00:00:29.250> so<00:00:30.119> I'm<00:00:30.390> going<00:00:30.599> to<00:00:30.630> show<00:00:30.810> it<00:00:30.929> to<00:00:30.960> you<00:00:31.309> I

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:32.309 
it and so I'm going to show it to you I

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:35.690 
it and so I'm going to show it to you I
may<00:00:32.700> as<00:00:32.759> well<00:00:32.850> okay<00:00:33.719> then<00:00:33.770> that<00:00:34.770> is<00:00:35.040> the<00:00:35.309> super

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:35.700 
may as well okay then that is the super

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:37.819 
may as well okay then that is the super
moon<00:00:35.850> apparently<00:00:36.690> it's<00:00:37.110> taken<00:00:37.530> me<00:00:37.620> all

00:00:37.819 --> 00:00:37.829 
moon apparently it's taken me all

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:41.889 
moon apparently it's taken me all
evening<00:00:38.280> to<00:00:38.790> actually<00:00:40.190> get<00:00:41.190> it<00:00:41.340> properly

00:00:41.889 --> 00:00:41.899 
evening to actually get it properly

00:00:41.899 --> 00:00:47.240 
evening to actually get it properly
because<00:00:44.000> it's<00:00:45.000> so<00:00:45.360> bright<00:00:45.750> to<00:00:46.559> really

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.250 
because it's so bright to really

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:50.090 
because it's so bright to really
difficult<00:00:47.670> to<00:00:47.760> focus<00:00:47.969> on<00:00:48.329> it<00:00:48.710> and<00:00:49.710> the<00:00:49.770> way<00:00:49.920> but

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
difficult to focus on it and the way but

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:51.439 
difficult to focus on it and the way but
it<00:00:50.190> now<00:00:50.340> it<00:00:50.460> looks<00:00:50.610> like<00:00:50.820> it's<00:00:51.000> got<00:00:51.090> some<00:00:51.270> sort

00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:51.449 
it now it looks like it's got some sort

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:54.650 
it now it looks like it's got some sort
of<00:00:51.649> blue<00:00:52.649> tinge<00:00:53.100> around<00:00:53.550> it<00:00:53.789> that<00:00:54.300> could<00:00:54.480> just

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:54.660 
of blue tinge around it that could just

00:00:54.660 --> 00:01:01.470 
of blue tinge around it that could just
be<00:00:54.829> my<00:00:55.829> eyes<00:00:56.100> in<00:00:56.430> this<00:00:56.610> gloom

00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:01.480 

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:04.360 

it's<00:01:01.870> quite<00:01:02.079> far<00:01:02.410> away

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:04.370 
it's quite far away

00:01:04.370 --> 00:01:09.850 
it's quite far away
Oh<00:01:04.430> close<00:01:05.090> I<00:01:05.420> go<00:01:06.370> first<00:01:07.370> move<00:01:08.620> look<00:01:09.620> at<00:01:09.740> the

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:09.860 
Oh close I go first move look at the

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:16.140 
Oh close I go first move look at the
moon<00:01:10.210> that's<00:01:11.210> the<00:01:11.390> moon<00:01:12.550> wow<00:01:14.800> that's

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:16.150 
moon that's the moon wow that's

00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:26.010 
moon that's the moon wow that's
impressive<00:01:17.560> moon<00:01:20.050> very<00:01:21.050> bright<00:01:21.470> in<00:01:21.770> the<00:01:21.890> sky

00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:26.020 

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:28.780 

on<00:01:27.020> a<00:01:27.050> tripod<00:01:27.440> but<00:01:27.860> it's<00:01:28.040> so<00:01:28.220> bright<00:01:28.550> it's

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:28.790 
on a tripod but it's so bright it's

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:34.740 
on a tripod but it's so bright it's
quite<00:01:29.000> difficult<00:01:29.210> to

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:34.750 

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:39.570 

so<00:01:35.230> this<00:01:35.380> is<00:01:35.410> the<00:01:35.590> supermoon<00:01:38.580> Harrison

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:39.580 
so this is the supermoon Harrison

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:47.940 
so this is the supermoon Harrison
perfect<00:01:40.180> i'll<00:01:41.080> let<00:01:41.290> you<00:01:41.440> decide<00:01:45.330> who<00:01:46.590> it's<00:01:47.590> the

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:47.950 
perfect i'll let you decide who it's the

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:53.609 
perfect i'll let you decide who it's the
moon<00:01:48.450> the<00:01:49.450> moon's<00:01:49.660> always<00:01:50.140> super<00:01:52.229> so<00:01:53.229> that's

00:01:53.609 --> 00:01:53.619 
moon the moon's always super so that's

00:01:53.619 --> 00:01:58.410 
moon the moon's always super so that's
apparently<00:01:54.160> a<00:01:54.220> super<00:01:54.880> moon<00:01:55.030> it's<00:01:56.160> super<00:01:57.420> isn't

00:01:58.410 --> 00:01:58.420 
apparently a super moon it's super isn't

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:22.449 
apparently a super moon it's super isn't
it<00:01:58.510> yay<00:01:59.760> alright<00:02:00.760> then<00:02:00.970> bye<00:02:01.270> bye

00:02:22.449 --> 00:02:22.459 

00:02:22.459 --> 00:02:27.140 

not<00:02:23.459> exactly<00:02:23.790> a<00:02:24.030> quiet<00:02:24.359> night<00:02:24.719> tonight
