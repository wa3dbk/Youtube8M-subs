00:00:22.190 --> 00:00:26.840
 when napoleon total war came out 

00:00:25.010 --> 00:00:29.780
 it is clear that we got 

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:33.290
 great game but something is not for me 

00:00:29.780 --> 00:00:37.430
 probably only one company was enough 

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:40.130
 and now June 22, 2010 

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:41.000
 the light came out an official addition under 

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:43.879
 by name 

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:47.200
 ppn insula campain which was 

00:00:43.879 --> 00:00:50.059
 devoted to the Napoleon Iberian campaign 

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:53.450
 although literally call 

00:00:50.059 --> 00:00:56.030
 company war on napoleon in spain 

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:59.059
 it was impossible it was war 

00:00:56.030 --> 00:01:02.390
 lingering difficult and ending 

00:00:59.059 --> 00:01:05.810
 the defeat of France and Bonaparte himself in it 

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:07.700
 did not participate then the french army 

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:10.580
 occupied most of the Pyrenean 

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:13.490
 Peninsula and led the battle with 

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:14.620
 partisans and British troops on 

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:17.659
 south of spain 

00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:20.120
 the players took the supplement enough 

00:01:17.659 --> 00:01:23.299
 negative and even called him 

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:26.510
 addon to addon hinting that 

00:01:23.299 --> 00:01:30.500
 napoleon total war is not quite full 

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:33.020
 game acquiring in general a small dlc 

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:37.190
 gamers received a map of the Pyrenean 

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:39.350
 peninsulas divided into 32 regions 28 

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:42.200
 new units and several 

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:44.840
 additional agents you can play 

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:47.360
 It was like for the French aggressors and 

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:49.990
 for the Anglo-Saxons restoring 

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:52.940
 the peninsula monarchist system 

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:54.860
 Spain is also represented as 

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:57.350
 game faction 

00:01:54.860 --> 00:02:00.380
 Of interest is playing for the British 

00:01:57.350 --> 00:02:02.330
 or the Spaniards primarily because they 

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:05.180
 more difficult position 

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:08.690
 than the French who control 

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:11.270
 initially almost the entire card on this 

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:14.660
 Spaniards have only two free cards 

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:18.430
 rebellious provinces and uk and 

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:21.050
 Moreover, only one is globally 

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:24.980
 it is clear that to fight for those who are weaker 

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:28.010
 usual more interesting early rip off 

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:30.970
 in peninsula campain call but no way 

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:33.590
 it was impossible to have quite a lot 

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:35.870
 supplement cost was 10 

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:38.840
 dollars to give that kind of money for 

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:41.959
 little addon players still not too 

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:45.590
 NATO fans and fans sought 

00:02:41.959 --> 00:02:47.980
 will do anything for the newcomer all the more 

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:52.520
