switch over to our windows server 2012
machine<00:00:30.029> and<00:00:30.240> we'll<00:00:30.779> go<00:00:30.960> to<00:00:31.019> the<00:00:31.199> hyper-v

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:31.830 
machine and we'll go to the hyper-v

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:35.240 
machine and we'll go to the hyper-v
management<00:00:32.279> console<00:00:32.910> and<00:00:33.590> connect<00:00:34.590> to<00:00:34.980> a

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:35.250 
management console and connect to a

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:37.729 
management console and connect to a
domain<00:00:35.820> controller<00:00:36.380> so<00:00:37.380> we've<00:00:37.590> got<00:00:37.680> the

00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:37.739 
domain controller so we've got the

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:39.110 
domain controller so we've got the
hyper-v<00:00:38.010> management<00:00:38.340> console<00:00:38.790> here<00:00:38.969> and<00:00:39.059> we

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120 
hyper-v management console here and we

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:41.990 
hyper-v management console here and we
can<00:00:39.270> see<00:00:39.450> we<00:00:39.600> have<00:00:39.629> a<00:00:39.809> machine<00:00:40.649> called<00:00:40.829> qad<00:00:41.460> co1

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.000 
can see we have a machine called qad co1

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.049 
can see we have a machine called qad co1
as<00:00:42.210> a<00:00:42.870> domain<00:00:43.230> controller<00:00:43.290> and<00:00:44.010> we<00:00:44.879> will

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:45.059 
as a domain controller and we will

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:46.910 
as a domain controller and we will
actually<00:00:45.180> take<00:00:45.690> a<00:00:45.750> snapshot<00:00:46.140> of<00:00:46.379> that<00:00:46.620> machine

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
actually take a snapshot of that machine

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:48.590 
actually take a snapshot of that machine
before<00:00:47.100> we<00:00:47.370> start<00:00:47.640> so<00:00:47.940> you<00:00:47.969> can<00:00:48.120> see<00:00:48.420> that

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
before we start so you can see that

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:51.290 
before we start so you can see that
we're<00:00:48.719> generating<00:00:49.440> a<00:00:49.860> snapshot<00:00:50.129> as<00:00:50.700> you<00:00:51.180> would

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 
we're generating a snapshot as you would

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:54.459 
we're generating a snapshot as you would
expect<00:00:51.469> with<00:00:52.469> any<00:00:52.680> virtualization<00:00:53.309> platform

00:00:54.459 --> 00:00:54.469 
expect with any virtualization platform

00:00:54.469 --> 00:00:57.170 
expect with any virtualization platform
having<00:00:55.469> completed<00:00:55.800> that<00:00:56.100> what<00:00:56.789> will<00:00:56.940> now<00:00:57.120> do

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 
having completed that what will now do

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:59.389 
having completed that what will now do
is<00:00:57.629> will<00:00:57.809> now<00:00:57.930> connect<00:00:58.410> to<00:00:58.770> Active<00:00:59.280> Directory

00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399 
is will now connect to Active Directory

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:01.819 
is will now connect to Active Directory
users<00:01:00.030> and<00:01:00.149> computers<00:01:00.270> and<00:01:00.870> we<00:01:01.530> will<00:01:01.649> make<00:01:01.800> a

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829 
users and computers and we will make a

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:04.549 
users and computers and we will make a
change<00:01:02.280> to<00:01:02.550> active<00:01:03.359> directory<00:01:03.510> so<00:01:04.409> in<00:01:04.500> this

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
change to active directory so in this

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:06.109 
change to active directory so in this
case<00:01:04.739> we'll<00:01:04.949> just<00:01:05.100> go<00:01:05.220> in<00:01:05.430> and<00:01:05.670> we'll<00:01:05.820> go<00:01:05.939> and

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
case we'll just go in and we'll go and

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:08.929 
case we'll just go in and we'll go and
create<00:01:06.270> a<00:01:06.360> user<00:01:06.659> so<00:01:07.650> nice<00:01:08.100> and<00:01:08.250> simple<00:01:08.460> we'll

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939 
create a user so nice and simple we'll

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:12.230 
create a user so nice and simple we'll
just<00:01:09.119> call<00:01:09.299> this<00:01:09.330> user<00:01:09.689> snapshot<00:01:10.320> user<00:01:11.240> now

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
just call this user snapshot user now

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:14.810 
just call this user snapshot user now
the<00:01:12.299> problem<00:01:12.630> you<00:01:12.900> often<00:01:13.200> run<00:01:13.229> into<00:01:13.640> if<00:01:14.640> you

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
the problem you often run into if you

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:16.429 
the problem you often run into if you
snapshot<00:01:15.240> domain<00:01:15.540> controllers<00:01:16.049> and<00:01:16.200> then

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439 
snapshot domain controllers and then

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:20.030 
snapshot domain controllers and then
roll<00:01:16.799> back<00:01:16.830> a<00:01:17.070> domain<00:01:18.030> controller<00:01:18.830> you<00:01:19.830> can

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:20.040 
roll back a domain controller you can

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:21.859 
roll back a domain controller you can
start<00:01:20.220> to<00:01:20.310> get<00:01:20.490> active<00:01:20.850> directory<00:01:21.000> diversions

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:21.869 
start to get active directory diversions

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:23.719 
start to get active directory diversions
because<00:01:22.259> the<00:01:22.500> system's<00:01:23.280> won't<00:01:23.460> start

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729 
because the system's won't start

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:25.490 
because the system's won't start
replicating<00:01:24.180> changes<00:01:24.900> between<00:01:25.170> themselves

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
replicating changes between themselves

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:28.160 
replicating changes between themselves
because<00:01:26.460> of<00:01:26.490> reusing<00:01:27.119> SIDS<00:01:27.509> and<00:01:27.810> various

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
because of reusing SIDS and various

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:33.230 
because of reusing SIDS and various
other<00:01:29.180> problems<00:01:30.200> so<00:01:31.670> we'll<00:01:32.670> just<00:01:32.700> confirm

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
other problems so we'll just confirm

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:34.940 
other problems so we'll just confirm
that<00:01:33.600> that<00:01:33.720> new<00:01:33.960> user<00:01:34.200> object<00:01:34.680> has<00:01:34.799> been

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
that that new user object has been

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:36.499 
that that new user object has been
replicated<00:01:35.159> across<00:01:35.670> to<00:01:36.000> the<00:01:36.119> other<00:01:36.150> domain

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:36.509 
replicated across to the other domain

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:38.060 
replicated across to the other domain
controller<00:01:36.869> that<00:01:37.200> we've<00:01:37.350> got<00:01:37.530> in<00:01:37.680> the<00:01:37.770> network

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:38.070 
controller that we've got in the network

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:40.580 
controller that we've got in the network
and<00:01:38.939> we<00:01:39.060> can<00:01:39.210> see<00:01:39.390> the<00:01:39.540> snapshot<00:01:39.960> user<00:01:40.200> account

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
and we can see the snapshot user account

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:44.990 
and we can see the snapshot user account
exists<00:01:42.020> so<00:01:43.020> having<00:01:43.890> completed<00:01:44.310> that<00:01:44.610> what<00:01:44.909> we

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000 
exists so having completed that what we

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.179 
exists so having completed that what we
could<00:01:45.149> now<00:01:45.299> do<00:01:45.360> is<00:01:46.140> we<00:01:46.380> can<00:01:46.530> now<00:01:46.680> actually<00:01:46.890> go

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:47.189 
could now do is we can now actually go

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:50.149 
could now do is we can now actually go
and<00:01:47.720> apply<00:01:48.720> the<00:01:48.869> snapshot<00:01:49.560> so<00:01:49.799> obviously<00:01:50.009> the

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:50.159 
and apply the snapshot so obviously the

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:54.319 
and apply the snapshot so obviously the
snapshot<00:01:50.640> I<00:01:50.670> took<00:01:50.759> just<00:01:51.270> now<00:01:51.450> was<00:01:51.990> before<00:01:53.329> the

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:54.329 
snapshot I took just now was before the

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:56.090 
snapshot I took just now was before the
user<00:01:54.600> account<00:01:54.960> was<00:01:55.170> created<00:01:55.350> so<00:01:55.829> I'm<00:01:55.890> going<00:01:56.070> to

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100 
user account was created so I'm going to

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:57.740 
user account was created so I'm going to
roll<00:01:56.310> the<00:01:56.490> domain<00:01:56.759> controller<00:01:57.119> back<00:01:57.420> to<00:01:57.659> an

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:57.750 
roll the domain controller back to an

00:01:57.750 --> 00:01:59.990 
roll the domain controller back to an
earlier<00:01:57.990> point<00:01:58.200> in<00:01:58.409> time<00:01:58.649> before<00:01:59.280> that<00:01:59.549> change

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.000 
earlier point in time before that change

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.389 
earlier point in time before that change
occurred<00:02:00.360> so<00:02:01.229> I'm<00:02:01.290> going<00:02:01.469> to<00:02:01.560> apply<00:02:01.770> the<00:02:01.860> early

00:02:02.389 --> 00:02:02.399 
occurred so I'm going to apply the early

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:06.170 
occurred so I'm going to apply the early
snapshot<00:02:02.880> and<00:02:04.549> that<00:02:05.549> will<00:02:05.670> now<00:02:05.790> apply<00:02:06.060> the

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:06.180 
snapshot and that will now apply the

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:08.900 
snapshot and that will now apply the
snapshot<00:02:06.840> now<00:02:07.170> what<00:02:07.380> actually<00:02:07.710> happens<00:02:08.160> is

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:08.910 
snapshot now what actually happens is

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:11.300 
snapshot now what actually happens is
once<00:02:09.270> the<00:02:09.420> snapshot<00:02:09.810> gets<00:02:09.989> applied<00:02:10.310> the

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:11.310 
once the snapshot gets applied the

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:13.940 
once the snapshot gets applied the
hypervisor<00:02:12.060> has<00:02:12.720> been<00:02:12.959> told<00:02:13.230> as<00:02:13.500> part<00:02:13.739> of

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:13.950 
hypervisor has been told as part of

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:15.650 
hypervisor has been told as part of
the<00:02:14.129> sort<00:02:14.400> of<00:02:14.489> process<00:02:14.970> Microsoft<00:02:15.540> has

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:15.660 
the sort of process Microsoft has

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:17.470 
the sort of process Microsoft has
developed<00:02:16.080> to<00:02:16.650> generate<00:02:17.010> a<00:02:17.040> new

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:17.480 
developed to generate a new

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:19.610 
developed to generate a new
identification<00:02:18.480> number<00:02:19.140> this<00:02:19.230> number<00:02:19.410> is

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:19.620 
identification number this number is

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:22.339 
identification number this number is
known<00:02:19.769> as<00:02:19.890> the<00:02:20.010> vm<00:02:20.340> generation<00:02:21.000> ID<00:02:21.209> so<00:02:22.050> this<00:02:22.200> is

00:02:22.339 --> 00:02:22.349 
known as the vm generation ID so this is

00:02:22.349 --> 00:02:24.860 
known as the vm generation ID so this is
a<00:02:22.379> number<00:02:22.620> that<00:02:22.800> the<00:02:23.280> hypervisor<00:02:23.790> presents<00:02:24.480> to

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:24.870 
a number that the hypervisor presents to

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:27.530 
a number that the hypervisor presents to
the<00:02:25.830> virtual<00:02:26.310> machine<00:02:26.430> Active<00:02:27.390> Directory

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:27.540 
the virtual machine Active Directory

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:29.210 
the virtual machine Active Directory
then<00:02:27.989> store<00:02:28.319> that<00:02:28.560> number<00:02:28.860> against<00:02:29.160> the

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:29.220 
then store that number against the

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:31.729 
then store that number against the
computer<00:02:29.430> object<00:02:30.200> inside<00:02:31.200> the<00:02:31.410> Active

00:02:31.729 --> 00:02:31.739 
computer object inside the Active

00:02:31.739 --> 00:02:33.920 
computer object inside the Active
Directory<00:02:31.890> database<00:02:32.480> because<00:02:33.480> that<00:02:33.630> number

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:33.930 
Directory database because that number

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:36.110 
Directory database because that number
has<00:02:34.050> been<00:02:34.080> changed<00:02:34.410> now<00:02:35.130> the<00:02:35.819> domain

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:36.120 
has been changed now the domain

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:37.790 
has been changed now the domain
controller<00:02:36.510> detects<00:02:36.989> that<00:02:37.260> so<00:02:37.470> if<00:02:37.560> we<00:02:37.680> now

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:37.800 
controller detects that so if we now

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:39.110 
controller detects that so if we now
look<00:02:37.830> in<00:02:38.099> the<00:02:38.190> event<00:02:38.220> messages<00:02:38.940> being

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:39.120 
look in the event messages being

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:41.449 
look in the event messages being
generated<00:02:39.599> you<00:02:40.319> can<00:02:40.500> now<00:02:40.680> see<00:02:40.739> that<00:02:40.980> it<00:02:41.220> states

00:02:41.449 --> 00:02:41.459 
generated you can now see that it states

00:02:41.459 --> 00:02:44.000 
generated you can now see that it states
that<00:02:41.610> the<00:02:41.849> generation<00:02:42.750> ID<00:02:42.930> change<00:02:43.830> has<00:02:43.980> been

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:44.010 
that the generation ID change has been

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:46.430 
that the generation ID change has been
detected<00:02:44.459> and<00:02:44.910> it<00:02:45.360> now<00:02:45.510> basically<00:02:45.930> goes<00:02:46.170> into

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:46.440 
detected and it now basically goes into

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:49.220 
detected and it now basically goes into
a<00:02:46.470> recovery<00:02:46.890> mode<00:02:47.370> so<00:02:48.269> as<00:02:48.360> part<00:02:48.569> of<00:02:48.660> going<00:02:48.870> into

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:49.230 
a recovery mode so as part of going into

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:50.870 
a recovery mode so as part of going into
a<00:02:49.260> recovery<00:02:49.590> mode<00:02:50.010> what<00:02:50.250> that<00:02:50.400> effectively

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:50.880 
a recovery mode what that effectively

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:54.710 
a recovery mode what that effectively
means<00:02:51.209> is<00:02:51.510> the<00:02:52.500> system<00:02:52.950> will<00:02:53.099> throw<00:02:53.370> away<00:02:53.730> the

00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:54.720 
means is the system will throw away the

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:57.710 
means is the system will throw away the
rid<00:02:55.230> pull<00:02:55.500> it<00:02:56.250> will<00:02:56.459> set<00:02:56.700> the<00:02:56.819> invocation<00:02:57.360> ID

00:02:57.710 --> 00:02:57.720 
rid pull it will set the invocation ID

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:00.229 
rid pull it will set the invocation ID
flag<00:02:58.230> and<00:02:58.530> it<00:02:58.920> will<00:02:59.040> cause<00:02:59.340> replication<00:03:00.120> to

00:03:00.229 --> 00:03:00.239 
flag and it will cause replication to

00:03:00.239 --> 00:03:02.150 
flag and it will cause replication to
occur<00:03:00.540> and<00:03:00.840> as<00:03:00.959> you<00:03:01.079> can<00:03:01.260> see<00:03:01.290> the<00:03:01.650> snapshot

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:02.160 
occur and as you can see the snapshot

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:04.520 
occur and as you can see the snapshot
user<00:03:02.430> account<00:03:02.880> has<00:03:03.480> been<00:03:03.690> replicated<00:03:03.989> across

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:04.530 
user account has been replicated across

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:07.190 
user account has been replicated across
back<00:03:05.010> to<00:03:05.040> this<00:03:05.280> domain<00:03:05.610> controller<00:03:06.200> safely

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:07.200 
back to this domain controller safely

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:10.280 
back to this domain controller safely
and<00:03:07.380> successfully<00:03:08.510> so<00:03:09.510> that<00:03:09.660> completes<00:03:10.110> the

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:10.290 
and successfully so that completes the

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:12.620 
and successfully so that completes the
demonstration<00:03:11.160> of<00:03:11.310> showing<00:03:11.819> snapshotting<00:03:12.390> of

2012<00:03:15.290> it<00:03:16.290> is<00:03:16.440> important<00:03:16.920> to<00:03:16.980> remember<00:03:17.010> that

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:17.310 
2012 it is important to remember that

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:18.800 
2012 it is important to remember that
any<00:03:17.519> hypervisor<00:03:18.120> you're<00:03:18.299> going<00:03:18.480> to<00:03:18.569> do<00:03:18.690> this

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:18.810 
any hypervisor you're going to do this

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:21.080 
any hypervisor you're going to do this
on<00:03:18.959> has<00:03:19.290> to<00:03:19.470> support<00:03:19.829> the<00:03:19.980> vm<00:03:20.250> generation<00:03:20.910> ID

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:21.090 
on has to support the vm generation ID

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:23.780 
on has to support the vm generation ID
so<00:03:21.450> today<00:03:21.780> thats<00:03:22.290> hype<00:03:22.560> of<00:03:22.739> hyper-v<00:03:23.459> running

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:23.790 
so today thats hype of hyper-v running

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:26.830 
so today thats hype of hyper-v running
on<00:03:23.880> Windows<00:03:24.209> Server<00:03:24.389> 2012<00:03:24.600> and<00:03:25.260> that's<00:03:25.859> VMware

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:26.840

00:03:29.599 --> 00:03:29.609 
5.1 and I'm sure other hypervisors

00:03:29.609 --> 00:03:32.479 
5.1 and I'm sure other hypervisors
including<00:03:30.030> such<00:03:30.239> exempt<00:03:30.829> will<00:03:31.829> have<00:03:32.280> this
