00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:05.460
 it is time again and I greet 

00:00:02.639 --> 00:00:07.140
 for the second questionnaire here at 

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:09.030
 blog the banner to your companions 

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:10.889
 I ask you questions of course 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:16.560
 always wants to answer for 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:18.390
 piece chosen the signed fun much of the 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:21.199
 Dominik asked me can you? 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:23.609
 imagine working as tt 

00:00:21.199 --> 00:00:25.350
 for all those who do not know what it is 

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:27.930
 atheist railroad worker in work service 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:29.820
 Specialist driver and transport 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:31.320
 So easy loco driver as well as in 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:33.239
 freight transport as well as in passenger transport 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:34.800
 I can imagine that in it 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:36.030
 Working is a difficult question I ask 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:37.440
 of course have some experience already 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:39.540
 made and allowed to collect 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:42.030
 However, I think that definitely 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:44.910
 it's not for me, I'm more like that 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:47.100
 yes i need bigger overview than 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:48.300
 only a view from the locomotive driver 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:49.710
 Cabin I say 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:52.440
 i am quite interesting the call 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:54.480
 but I think that would not be for me 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:56.699
 the tobi asked me what is 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:59.340
 actually a central office and what 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:02.329
 makes a transport central one 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:05.100
 headquarters is the place where several 

00:01:02.329 --> 00:01:08.159
 interlockings or 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:10.380
 several stations united in one place 

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:11.820
 and are controlled from there to 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:13.799
 example in europe sitting in the 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:17.150
 headquarters beside hannover itself 

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:20.280
 also hamburg lÃ¼beck kiel bremen 

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:22.170
 fallersleben hildesheim everyone is sitting 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:24.180
 so in a boat and still have 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:26.909
 numerous surrounding smaller train stations 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:28.780
 with on their monitors that from the 

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:32.890
 be controlled 

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:37.180
 a transport central is eg if db 

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:41.979
 Fernverkehr says ten is fat 

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:44.680
 equal to 1 844 and on track 4 is 1 589 

00:01:41.979 --> 00:01:46.240
 then you can say for example 

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:48.100
 should still take connection because just 

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:49.570
 there are so many traveling in there are still 

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:51.310
 crime like in the other direction 

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:53.350
 besides, they can say that as well 

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:56.140
 we have to put a dare out of it 

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:57.340
 must expose the rear zugteil there 

00:01:56.140 --> 00:01:59.140
 then a new one comes from another 

00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:00.640
 be merged 

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:02.080
 All this makes the transport central 

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:03.100
 that has every cover 

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:05.170
 Transport company if I am right 

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:08.679
 remember db regio db long-distance traffic 

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:10.570
 metronome rx and many more 

00:02:08.679 --> 00:02:12.180
 this next to then for each 

00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:15.130
 forgot to operate responsibly 

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:17.709
 the davis i hope i speak here 

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:21.130
 Have you asked me out? 

00:02:17.709 --> 00:02:22.450
 free I know about a real iloxx 

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:24.760
 it always comes as if I'll make you 

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:26.200
 not at all free you have to say 

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:28.630
 that, of course, everything I do for that 

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:30.190
 block and make youtube in mine 

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:31.980
 leisure therefore happens at the time 

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:35.440
 where I do that I also have free 

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:36.970
 However, there are days where I am 

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:39.820
 really does not do anything for it 

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:42.519
 there are rarely but or for example at least 

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:44.200
 Half a day, this part is there 

00:02:42.519 --> 00:02:48.090
 and otherwise I just have normal 

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:50.049
 a 38 hour week mostly more though 

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:51.790
 38 hours a week at the train in 

00:02:50.049 --> 00:02:52.930
 shift service and everything else I do 

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:55.480
 make that finally free time 

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:57.549
 I do it like having block to youtube 

00:02:55.480 --> 00:03:00.609
 that is him but that is ultimately 

00:02:57.549 --> 00:03:02.260
 my free time the web tv star have 

00:03:00.609 --> 00:03:04.060
 asked me on youtube what was that one 

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:06.060
 actually as a club leader many 

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:08.620
 mean that it only press buttons 

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:11.489
 I get this question very often 

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:14.200
 and I have to say that 

00:03:11.489 --> 00:03:16.359
 many companies realized that I 

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:18.040
 People can not imagine anything at all 

00:03:16.359 --> 00:03:19.670
 who know that, yes, everything is clear 

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:21.470
 there is one to be before 

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:23.090
 he yells or left few levers to 

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:26.120
 or sitting on your computer now 

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:28.760
 the technology makes a lot and he pushes 

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:30.440
 In the end, it was a simple task and that 

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:31.459
 whole is done there you can 

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:34.310
 do not involve a lot of money 

00:03:31.459 --> 00:03:35.660
 no, that's not as good as me 

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:38.569
 do not deserve any boys now I deserve 

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:39.530
 also not several thousand euros but im 

00:03:38.569 --> 00:03:41.000
 internet you can do that exactly 

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:42.410
 read how many finest loses 

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:46.390
 It always depends on the type of interlocking 

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:48.860
 from the station from how much train operation is there 

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:50.060
 and who thinks that only buttons 

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:52.400
 Press now he recommended I times 

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:54.170
 Just come by both in 

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:55.430
 the company headquarters hannover as well 

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:56.930
 on some small stand once 

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:58.819
 to knock you can see how 

00:03:56.930 --> 00:04:01.130
 that runs there and then you can like 

00:03:58.819 --> 00:04:02.269
 also claim that the whole only buttons 

00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:04.340
 expresses me is if so really 

00:04:02.269 --> 00:04:05.450
 would be like I said just once 

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:06.920
 Just drop by 

00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:09.019
 also read more or just 

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:10.850
 I already watch videos 

00:04:09.019 --> 00:04:12.620
 did by explaining that is 

00:04:10.850 --> 00:04:14.720
 definitely not just pushing buttons 

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:17.229
 The last question comes from Lukas and he 

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:19.489
 asked me did you have a girlfriend 

00:04:17.229 --> 00:04:21.260
 Also a very frequently asked question 

00:04:19.489 --> 00:04:24.110
 initially on youtube when I started 

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:24.680
 many have me as a homosexual 

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:26.930
 seen 

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:29.510
 that is not so I am quite normal 

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:31.580
 heterosexual and I have a girlfriend 

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:33.410
 and maybe we'll get her in that 

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:34.960
 one or the other video or blog if 

00:04:33.410 --> 00:04:36.680
 soon one will come and see 

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:38.840
 underworld is determined too 

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:40.370
 learn to recognize something is today 

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:43.669
 with the second edition of the 

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:45.020
 questioner from the blogging banner replied 

00:04:43.669 --> 00:04:46.430
 questioned to me sorry that i 

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:47.990
 I could not answer all the questions 

00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:50.180
 try in the comment function 

00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:52.220
 under the videos or in facebook and 

00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:53.690
 just do not twitter back to you 

00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:54.919

 Write me under this video 

00:04:56.870 --> 00:05:00.700

00:04:58.870 --> 00:05:02.020

00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:03.430

00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:06.240
