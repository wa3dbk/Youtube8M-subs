 Hello dear friends today on 

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:18.770
 my channel is another interesting build 

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:22.849
 composition as you probably already read 

00:00:18.770 --> 00:00:24.590
 the name of the video I will collect the composition 

00:00:22.849 --> 00:00:26.689
 fathers and children 

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:30.529
 that is, I will include 

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:33.430
 those players whose fathers were some 

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:36.470
 good footballers known and even 

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:39.170
 also have legend cards and even 

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:40.820
 some of them and this composition 

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:43.309
 Here on the idea of ​​such a composition of me 

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:45.559
 pushed two people whom you 

00:00:43.309 --> 00:00:47.799
 now see your screens in front of you 

00:00:45.559 --> 00:00:50.479
 this is brendan rogers head coach 

00:00:47.799 --> 00:00:53.299
 football club liverpool and his son 

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:56.150
 Anton Rodgers who serves there 

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:58.159
 lower divisions of england his card 

00:00:56.150 --> 00:01:01.100
 see in front of you and let's quietly 

00:00:58.159 --> 00:01:03.680
 We will proceed to the basic composition but 

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:07.100
 before proceeding with this mainly 

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:09.170
 the composition of the guys want to give you 

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:11.299
 a reference to your own movie whatever 

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:13.880
 a little not popiarit himself who else 

00:01:11.299 --> 00:01:16.190
 I did not watch the movie where I ride fifa 14 

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:19.040
 be sure to check my references 

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:21.080
 add prim here now you 

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:23.660
 you can go to it and we start 

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:25.880
 Galki 1 our team becomes Casper 

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:27.770
 Schmeichel and son of the famous artero Petrush 

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:30.410
 Michel and I think you all know very well 

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:33.010
 about this football family casper hype 

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:36.920
 or follow in the footsteps of his father also his father 

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:39.830
 has a legend card verses 15 and i 

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:42.290
 I think we can move further to the left in 

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:45.710
 protection, I decided to put Denis cheryshev 

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:48.770
 his father Dmitry Chirkov also spoke at 

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:49.400
 league is whiter for sporting is he huana but 

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:52.190
 denis 

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:54.650
 Naturally already surpassed father 

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:56.090
 he speaks just fine especially 

00:01:54.650 --> 00:01:58.790
 now in rent 

00:01:56.090 --> 00:02:01.100
 led real to the right in the crow will play 

00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:03.830
 nominal opornik but in fact 

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:06.560
 just universal player bailey bling 

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:07.540
 and he is the son of danny damn yes 

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:10.479
 which at this 

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:11.820
 cop takes the post of assistant chief 

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:13.840
 Ajax trainer 

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:16.270
 remind you that the head coach 

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:19.450
 is franc de boer and good gangs 

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:22.240
 there is going and far blind father up 

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:24.310
 or damn yes one of those who develop 

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:26.260
 Dutch youth due to lack of 

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:29.230
 players in central defense I decided here 

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:31.450
 put sergio busquets son known 

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:34.780
 goalkeeper barcelona kar forest busquets and 

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:37.090
 so little information and father and son 

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:38.950
 beat the Champions League as part of 

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:39.370
 the same club barcelona little 

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:42.220
 to whom 

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:42.850
 probably it was possible but if it can 

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:45.910
 be only 

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:48.700
 checks and family maldini our central 

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:51.160
 Alex Breus becomes a defender 

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:54.760
 center back from hull city and he 

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:57.010
 is the son of a famous trainer steve 

00:02:54.760 --> 00:03:02.140
 Bruce here he is on your screens 

00:02:57.010 --> 00:03:04.660
 just like his son coached hull 

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:06.550
 city and at this moment his son was playing 

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:08.620
 the club I talked a little bit but I 

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:10.810
 I think you understand what I'm talking about now he 

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:13.030
 as far as I know without work 

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:15.970
 he coached many famous 

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:17.950
 English clubs and as a player 

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:19.989
 even played for Manchester United 

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:22.420
 next players in our lineup 

00:03:19.989 --> 00:03:25.150
 are becoming brothers Raphael and 

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:27.489
 alcantara and thiago alcantara their father 

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:29.250
 which you see now in front of you on 

00:03:27.489 --> 00:03:32.049
 their screens and ointments it 

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:36.160
 brazilian soccer player who is 

00:03:32.049 --> 00:03:38.530
 for a moment world champion 1994 

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:42.370
 which was gone 

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:43.120
 his sons are now playing in different 

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:45.130
 clubs 

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:49.360
 have unfortunately a different nationality 

00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:52.540
 at the same time , the most nonsense of this game is 

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:54.640
 as a fifa, I believe that there are no brothers 

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:57.400
 no link between them 

00:03:54.640 --> 00:04:00.250
 the red line and i think that this 

00:03:57.400 --> 00:04:03.489
 minor refinement flaw that 

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:06.010
 it is necessary well, as if to remove the game and at least 

00:04:03.489 --> 00:04:08.950
 on the yellow line give these guys the right 

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:11.830
 there is ines the son of the famous 

00:04:08.950 --> 00:04:14.470
 midfielder paul young who by the way 

00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:16.799
 speaking played both for manchester united and for 

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:19.590
 liverpool and now is 

00:04:16.799 --> 00:04:22.560
 us blackpool coach and thomas played 

00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:27.000
 assimilate into the team I think you are now 

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:29.599
 see him in blackpool shirt and he in our 

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:30.840
 the lineup will play on the left and so 

00:04:29.599 --> 00:04:34.259
 fernandez 

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:37.020
 son of the most famous midfielder Zinedine 

00:04:34.259 --> 00:04:38.490
 zidan and i think his father needs neither 

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:42.120
 in what representations 

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:44.550
 but none the less and the pupil of real and 

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:48.090
 he plays naturally worse than his 

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:50.460
 father but he is still young and in the making 

00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:53.639
 Of course he is good and not so much and I 

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:55.889
 I hope he can reveal us 

00:04:53.639 --> 00:04:59.099
 potential at least a small fraction of 

00:04:55.889 --> 00:05:02.039
 As his father was playing well and healthy 

00:04:59.099 --> 00:05:05.789
 our attacker becomes Bradley Wright 

00:05:02.039 --> 00:05:06.810
 philips and also on replacing his brother shawn 

00:05:05.789 --> 00:05:11.300
 wright philips 

00:05:06.810 --> 00:05:14.639
 their father I am on Wright famous footballer 

00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:16.830
 arsenal i think london fans 

00:05:14.639 --> 00:05:20.150
 Club understanding this I say if you 

00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:22.770
 certainly followed the history of this club and 

00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:25.469
 bradley wright philips is native 

00:05:22.770 --> 00:05:28.050
 I am the son of Wright, but Sean is 

00:05:25.469 --> 00:05:31.169
 adopted son but nonetheless how would I 

00:05:28.050 --> 00:05:33.090
 included their composition well still frank 

00:05:31.169 --> 00:05:35.819
 Lampard I decided to add to the bench 

00:05:33.090 --> 00:05:37.830
 spare his father frank lampard senior 

00:05:35.819 --> 00:05:41.219
 also played football but naturally 

00:05:37.830 --> 00:05:44.219
 his son outperformed much better 

00:05:41.219 --> 00:05:46.110
 personal and team achievements let 

00:05:44.219 --> 00:05:47.520
 will be well on our bench also 

00:05:46.110 --> 00:05:50.909
 Here is the composition I could include 

00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:52.680
 if besides for example there was an ixbox family 

00:05:50.909 --> 00:05:54.180
 or you can even say the whole 

00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:57.479
 Maldini generation 

00:05:54.180 --> 00:06:00.930
 this is eldest chezare his son paolo 

00:05:57.479 --> 00:06:03.449
 Maldini non-replaceable captain of Milan and 

00:06:00.930 --> 00:06:05.819
 he also has several 

00:06:03.449 --> 00:06:08.279
 sons who also play defense 

00:06:05.819 --> 00:06:09.020
 Milan there youths here also could 

00:06:08.279 --> 00:06:12.449
 get there 

00:06:09.020 --> 00:06:14.819
 laudrup and his son playing in my opinion somewhere 

00:06:12.449 --> 00:06:17.789
 along in the Norwegian whether in the Danish league 

00:06:14.819 --> 00:06:20.610
 and other famous football players for example 

00:06:17.789 --> 00:06:23.189
 alex oksleyd-chamberlain his father also 

00:06:20.610 --> 00:06:25.919
 well and many others also you can 

00:06:23.189 --> 00:06:28.979
 write in the comments some more 

00:06:25.919 --> 00:06:30.840

00:06:28.979 --> 00:06:32.849
 sure to be revered will not be interesting 

00:06:30.840 --> 00:06:35.159
 maybe I forgot someone but basically 

00:06:32.849 --> 00:06:39.000
 everything looks like this our composition 

00:06:35.159 --> 00:06:40.860
 I still remembered Habi Alonso, if not 

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:44.490
 wrong his father also played 

00:06:40.860 --> 00:06:46.680
 professional football and play this one 

00:06:44.490 --> 00:06:49.050
 teams I will not match the record as you 

00:06:46.680 --> 00:06:51.689
 you understand she is dismantled and completely up 

00:06:49.050 --> 00:06:54.629
 some football player are not positioned 

00:06:51.689 --> 00:06:57.120
 teamwork no missing goals 

00:06:54.629 --> 00:06:59.759
