now<00:01:47.899> I<00:01:47.930> switch<00:01:48.259> to<00:01:48.500> a<00:01:48.530> 4000<00:01:49.280> grit<00:01:49.399> water<00:01:49.640> stone

00:01:49.959 --> 00:01:49.969 
now I switch to a 4000 grit water stone

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:51.249 
now I switch to a 4000 grit water stone
and<00:01:50.210> I'll<00:01:50.270> just<00:01:50.420> go<00:01:50.570> ahead<00:01:50.630> and<00:01:50.840> repeat<00:01:51.110> the

00:01:51.249 --> 00:01:51.259 
and I'll just go ahead and repeat the

00:01:51.259 --> 00:02:14.410 
and I'll just go ahead and repeat the
process<00:02:12.519> now<00:02:13.519> what<00:02:13.700> I<00:02:13.730> need<00:02:13.849> to<00:02:14.060> do<00:02:14.180> is<00:02:14.330> go

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:14.420 
process now what I need to do is go

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:15.820 
process now what I need to do is go
ahead<00:02:14.569> and<00:02:14.690> knock<00:02:14.810> off<00:02:14.989> any<00:02:15.200> bird<00:02:15.500> that<00:02:15.530> was

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:15.830 
ahead and knock off any bird that was

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:17.619 
ahead and knock off any bird that was
created<00:02:16.370> in<00:02:16.489> the<00:02:16.610> process<00:02:16.819> of<00:02:17.239> flattening

00:02:17.619 --> 00:02:17.629 
created in the process of flattening

00:02:17.629 --> 00:02:19.990 
created in the process of flattening
this<00:02:17.840> edge<00:02:18.080> and<00:02:18.349> I'll<00:02:18.769> do<00:02:18.920> that<00:02:19.069> on<00:02:19.220> my<00:02:19.340> 4000

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:20.000 
this edge and I'll do that on my 4000

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:37.569 
this edge and I'll do that on my 4000
grit<00:02:20.120> water<00:02:20.360> stone<00:02:36.010> the<00:02:37.010> next<00:02:37.250> part<00:02:37.459> of<00:02:37.489> the

00:02:37.569 --> 00:02:37.579 
grit water stone the next part of the

00:02:37.579 --> 00:02:39.850 
grit water stone the next part of the
process<00:02:38.120> involves<00:02:38.660> using<00:02:38.900> a<00:02:39.110> burnisher<00:02:39.620> and

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:39.860 
process involves using a burnisher and

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:41.740 
process involves using a burnisher and
what<00:02:40.370> we'll<00:02:40.519> do<00:02:40.670> is<00:02:40.880> we'll<00:02:41.030> push<00:02:41.360> the<00:02:41.569> metal

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:41.750 
what we'll do is we'll push the metal

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:44.080 
what we'll do is we'll push the metal
out<00:02:42.049> towards<00:02:42.860> the<00:02:43.010> edge<00:02:43.190> of<00:02:43.430> the<00:02:43.489> card<00:02:43.760> scraper

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:44.090 
out towards the edge of the card scraper

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:46.240 
out towards the edge of the card scraper
and<00:02:44.420> then<00:02:44.989> we'll<00:02:45.140> take<00:02:45.349> that<00:02:45.530> metal<00:02:45.890> and<00:02:46.130> we'll

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:46.250 
and then we'll take that metal and we'll

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:49.059 
and then we'll take that metal and we'll
fold<00:02:46.549> it<00:02:46.760> over<00:02:46.910> to<00:02:47.420> form<00:02:47.660> the<00:02:47.810> hook<00:02:47.989> I<00:02:48.290> went

00:02:49.059 --> 00:02:49.069 
fold it over to form the hook I went

00:02:49.069 --> 00:02:50.740 
fold it over to form the hook I went
ahead<00:02:49.160> and<00:02:49.310> sprayed<00:02:49.610> my<00:02:49.880> burnisher<00:02:50.329> with<00:02:50.510> just

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:50.750 
ahead and sprayed my burnisher with just

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:53.410 
ahead and sprayed my burnisher with just
a<00:02:50.810> little<00:02:51.049> bit<00:02:51.139> of<00:02:51.230> wd-40<00:02:51.799> and<00:02:52.040> that<00:02:52.400> helps<00:02:53.060> the

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:53.420 
a little bit of wd-40 and that helps the

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:56.170 
a little bit of wd-40 and that helps the

00:04:56.239 --> 00:04:56.249 
other and becoming dull what I did was I

00:04:56.249 --> 00:04:58.489 
other and becoming dull what I did was I
took<00:04:56.310> a<00:04:56.460> block<00:04:56.759> of<00:04:56.939> wood<00:04:56.969> and<00:04:57.360> ran<00:04:57.870> some<00:04:58.139> table

00:04:58.489 --> 00:04:58.499 
took a block of wood and ran some table

00:04:58.499 --> 00:05:00.230 
took a block of wood and ran some table
saw<00:04:58.680> curves<00:04:58.979> down<00:04:59.340> the<00:04:59.520> length<00:04:59.729> of<00:04:59.879> the<00:04:59.969> board

00:05:00.230 --> 00:05:00.240 
saw curves down the length of the board

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:02.809 
saw curves down the length of the board
and<00:05:00.539> what<00:05:01.379> this<00:05:01.529> allows<00:05:01.800> me<00:05:01.830> to<00:05:02.069> do<00:05:02.370> is<00:05:02.400> to

00:05:02.809 --> 00:05:02.819 
and what this allows me to do is to

00:05:02.819 --> 00:05:06.290 
and what this allows me to do is to
store<00:05:03.180> my<00:05:03.509> car<00:05:04.020> scrapers<00:05:04.759> so<00:05:05.759> that<00:05:05.939> they<00:05:06.060> don't

00:05:06.290 --> 00:05:06.300 
store my car scrapers so that they don't

00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:09.649 
store my car scrapers so that they don't

00:05:09.649 --> 00:05:09.659 
knock into each other well that's all

00:05:09.659 --> 00:05:09.980 
knock into each other well that's all
I've<00:05:09.750> got

00:05:09.980 --> 00:05:09.990 
I've got

00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:11.300 
I've got
