00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:30.470 
is the 95 wide plant is probably our

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:32.860 
is the 95 wide plant is probably our
most<00:00:30.500> popular<00:00:31.160> board<00:00:31.369> that<00:00:31.580> we<00:00:31.700> that<00:00:32.599> we<00:00:32.750> have

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:32.870 
most popular board that we that we have

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:35.410 
most popular board that we that we have
in<00:00:33.050> the<00:00:33.140> starboard<00:00:33.559> lineup<00:00:33.980> and<00:00:34.160> the<00:00:35.000> reason

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:35.420 
in the starboard lineup and the reason

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:38.020 
in the starboard lineup and the reason
is<00:00:35.600> it's<00:00:35.900> you<00:00:36.320> know<00:00:36.410> it's<00:00:36.559> 9<00:00:36.770> 5<00:00:37.040> so<00:00:37.309> it's<00:00:37.430> easy

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:38.030 
is it's you know it's 9 5 so it's easy

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:40.689 
is it's you know it's 9 5 so it's easy
to<00:00:38.210> turn<00:00:38.570> good<00:00:38.809> for<00:00:39.050> surfing<00:00:39.470> but<00:00:40.129> at<00:00:40.280> 32

00:00:40.689 --> 00:00:40.699 
to turn good for surfing but at 32

00:00:40.699 --> 00:00:43.930 
to turn good for surfing but at 32
inches<00:00:40.940> wide<00:00:41.210> it's<00:00:41.710> quite<00:00:42.710> stable<00:00:43.070> so<00:00:43.699> it's

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:43.940 
inches wide it's quite stable so it's

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:47.410 
inches wide it's quite stable so it's
good<00:00:44.150> for<00:00:44.590> bigger<00:00:45.590> guys<00:00:45.890> or<00:00:46.220> also<00:00:46.790> on<00:00:47.090> people

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:47.420

good for bigger guys or also on people
that<00:00:47.629> need<00:00:48.019> a<00:00:48.050> little<00:00:48.140> bit<00:00:48.290> more<00:00:48.500> stability

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:48.860 
that need a little bit more stability

despite being 32 inches wide it's still

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:04.899 
despite being 32 inches wide it's still
surfs<00:01:01.489> really<00:01:01.610> well<00:01:02.589> so<00:01:03.589> that<00:01:03.699> makes<00:01:04.699> it<00:01:04.820> a

00:01:04.899 --> 00:01:04.909 
surfs really well so that makes it a

00:01:04.909 --> 00:01:06.940 
surfs really well so that makes it a
really<00:01:05.030> nice<00:01:05.239> all-around<00:01:05.810> kind<00:01:06.290> of<00:01:06.409> board<00:01:06.650> for

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:06.950 
really nice all-around kind of board for

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:09.280

deck pad with a nice tail kick you know

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:29.860 
deck pad with a nice tail kick you know
the<00:01:27.530> shape<00:01:28.070> is<00:01:28.310> refined<00:01:28.820> you<00:01:29.450> know<00:01:29.540> they've

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:29.870 
the shape is refined you know they've

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:31.810 
the shape is refined you know they've
been<00:01:29.900> doing<00:01:30.320> wide<00:01:30.650> points<00:01:31.040> for<00:01:31.220> several<00:01:31.610> years

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:31.820 
been doing wide points for several years

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:34.390 
been doing wide points for several years
but<00:01:32.000> this<00:01:32.180> is<00:01:32.300> a<00:01:32.330> fairly<00:01:32.990> new<00:01:33.170> model<00:01:33.770> the<00:01:33.950> 9/5

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:34.400 
but this is a fairly new model the 9/5

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:37.920 
but this is a fairly new model the 9/5
started<00:01:34.910> they<00:01:35.270> brought<00:01:35.480> it<00:01:35.570> out<00:01:35.660> in<00:01:35.690> 2012<00:01:36.620> and

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:37.930 
started they brought it out in 2012 and

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:40.810 
started they brought it out in 2012 and
yeah<00:01:38.930> so<00:01:39.290> this<00:01:39.800> one<00:01:39.950> is<00:01:40.070> the<00:01:40.100> AST<00:01:40.640> wood

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:40.820 
yeah so this one is the AST wood

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:42.810 
yeah so this one is the AST wood
construction<00:01:41.480> comes<00:01:42.050> with<00:01:42.230> the<00:01:42.350> red<00:01:42.560> rails

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:42.820 
construction comes with the red rails

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:46.870 
construction comes with the red rails
the<00:01:43.820> bottom<00:01:44.240> has<00:01:44.980> that<00:01:45.980> sound<00:01:46.400> its<00:01:46.580> feet

00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:46.880 
the bottom has that sound its feet

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:51.880 
the bottom has that sound its feet
finish<00:01:47.360> and<00:01:49.180> you<00:01:50.180> know<00:01:50.270> got<00:01:50.510> it<00:01:50.630> has<00:01:50.780> five<00:01:51.140> five

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:51.890

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:53.770 
finish and you know got it has five five
fin<00:01:52.130> boxes<00:01:52.550> so<00:01:52.700> you<00:01:52.730> can<00:01:52.940> set<00:01:53.150> it<00:01:53.240> up<00:01:53.270> as<00:01:53.450> a<00:01:53.630> two

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:53.780 
fin boxes so you can set it up as a two

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:55.690 
fin boxes so you can set it up as a two
plus<00:01:53.960> one<00:01:54.020> which<00:01:54.470> is<00:01:54.650> how<00:01:54.770> it<00:01:54.890> comes<00:01:55.130> with<00:01:55.520> the

fins included starboard hex L fins or
you<00:01:59.510> can<00:01:59.630> also<00:01:59.780> write<00:02:00.020> as<00:02:00.140> a<00:02:00.230> quad<00:02:00.530> which<00:02:00.800> makes

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:01.040 
you can also write as a quad which makes

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:03.730 
you can also write as a quad which makes
it<00:02:01.190> more<00:02:01.340> loose<00:02:01.550> and<00:02:02.200> let's<00:02:03.200> take<00:02:03.380> a<00:02:03.409> look<00:02:03.620> at

00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:03.740 
it more loose and let's take a look at

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:04.870 
it more loose and let's take a look at
some<00:02:03.920> of<00:02:04.010> the<00:02:04.070> other<00:02:04.190> constructions<00:02:04.820> that

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:04.880 
some of the other constructions that

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:07.719 
some of the other constructions that
they<00:02:05.120> have<00:02:05.240> available<00:02:05.920> okay<00:02:06.920> so<00:02:06.979> this<00:02:07.460> one<00:02:07.700> is

00:02:07.719 --> 00:02:07.729 
they have available okay so this one is

00:02:07.729 --> 00:02:11.770 
they have available okay so this one is
the<00:02:07.909> AC<00:02:08.569> Kandy<00:02:09.229> construction<00:02:09.830> for<00:02:10.220> 2013<00:02:11.150> the

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:11.780 
the AC Kandy construction for 2013 the

this year so everyone's really stoked on
these<00:05:55.990> boards<00:05:56.230> and<00:05:56.760> so<00:05:57.760> you<00:05:57.850> know<00:05:58.060> by<00:05:58.210> keeping

00:05:58.590 --> 00:05:58.600 
these boards and so you know by keeping

00:05:58.600 --> 00:06:01.890 
these boards and so you know by keeping
the<00:05:58.780> weight<00:05:58.960> lower<00:05:59.340> the<00:06:00.340> board's<00:06:00.760> it<00:06:01.420> makes

00:06:01.890 --> 00:06:01.900 
the weight lower the board's it makes

00:06:01.900 --> 00:06:03.360 
the weight lower the board's it makes
the<00:06:02.200> board<00:06:02.440> feel<00:06:02.620> a<00:06:02.650> little<00:06:02.740> bit<00:06:02.860> smaller<00:06:03.220> you

00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:03.370 
the board feel a little bit smaller you

00:06:03.370 --> 00:06:05.130 
the board feel a little bit smaller you
got<00:06:03.640> less<00:06:04.030> board<00:06:04.300> to<00:06:04.420> swing<00:06:04.690> around<00:06:04.810> when

00:06:05.130 --> 00:06:05.140 
got less board to swing around when

00:06:05.140 --> 00:06:06.630 
got less board to swing around when
you're<00:06:05.260> turning<00:06:05.500> the<00:06:06.010> swing<00:06:06.280> weight<00:06:06.460> is

00:06:06.630 --> 00:06:06.640 
you're turning the swing weight is

00:06:06.640 --> 00:06:09.300 
you're turning the swing weight is
smaller<00:06:07.090> the<00:06:07.990> acceleration<00:06:08.650> is<00:06:08.770> faster<00:06:09.190> is

00:06:09.300 --> 00:06:09.310 
smaller the acceleration is faster is

00:06:09.310 --> 00:06:11.430 
smaller the acceleration is faster is
easier<00:06:09.580> to<00:06:09.730> catch<00:06:09.910> waves<00:06:10.180> with<00:06:10.420> it<00:06:10.570> I<00:06:10.750> would

00:06:11.430 --> 00:06:11.440 
easier to catch waves with it I would

00:06:11.440 --> 00:06:13.200 
easier to catch waves with it I would
say<00:06:11.620> the<00:06:11.770> only<00:06:11.980> downside<00:06:12.430> when<00:06:12.940> you<00:06:13.060> have<00:06:13.150> a

00:06:13.200 --> 00:06:13.210 
say the only downside when you have a

00:06:13.210 --> 00:06:14.970 
say the only downside when you have a
really<00:06:13.480> light<00:06:13.630> board<00:06:13.930> is<00:06:14.050> if<00:06:14.500> you<00:06:14.710> have<00:06:14.830> really

00:06:14.970 --> 00:06:14.980 
really light board is if you have really

00:06:14.980 --> 00:06:16.560 
really light board is if you have really
strong<00:06:15.130> offshore<00:06:15.610> winds<00:06:16.000> it<00:06:16.180> makes<00:06:16.390> a<00:06:16.480> little

00:06:16.560 --> 00:06:16.570 
strong offshore winds it makes a little

00:06:16.570 --> 00:06:18.090 
strong offshore winds it makes a little
bit<00:06:16.660> harder<00:06:17.020> to<00:06:17.050> make<00:06:17.350> the<00:06:17.470> drop<00:06:17.710> into<00:06:17.980> the

00:06:18.090 --> 00:06:18.100 
bit harder to make the drop into the

00:06:18.100 --> 00:06:19.590 
bit harder to make the drop into the
wave<00:06:18.280> where<00:06:18.910> sometimes<00:06:19.150> a<00:06:19.360> little<00:06:19.510> bit

00:06:19.590 --> 00:06:19.600 
wave where sometimes a little bit

00:06:19.600 --> 00:06:20.880 
wave where sometimes a little bit
heavier<00:06:19.870> board<00:06:20.169> can<00:06:20.350> give<00:06:20.500> you<00:06:20.590> a<00:06:20.620> little<00:06:20.740> bit

00:06:20.880 --> 00:06:20.890 
heavier board can give you a little bit

00:06:20.890 --> 00:06:23.100 
heavier board can give you a little bit
more<00:06:21.040> momentum<00:06:21.220> and<00:06:21.790> also<00:06:22.630> going<00:06:22.870> through

00:06:23.100 --> 00:06:23.110 
more momentum and also going through

00:06:23.110 --> 00:06:25.230 
more momentum and also going through
chop<00:06:23.410> on<00:06:23.680> a<00:06:23.740> windy<00:06:24.130> day<00:06:24.160> sometimes<00:06:24.910> the<00:06:25.060> light

00:06:25.230 --> 00:06:25.240 
chop on a windy day sometimes the light

00:06:25.240 --> 00:06:27.480 
chop on a windy day sometimes the light
board<00:06:25.540> is<00:06:25.690> not<00:06:25.870> an<00:06:26.110> advantage<00:06:26.470> but<00:06:26.800> most<00:06:27.370> of

00:06:27.480 --> 00:06:27.490 
board is not an advantage but most of

00:06:27.490 --> 00:06:29.550 
board is not an advantage but most of
the<00:06:27.580> time<00:06:27.790> lighter<00:06:28.419> is<00:06:28.660> better<00:06:28.900> obviously<00:06:29.140> and

00:06:29.550 --> 00:06:29.560 
the time lighter is better obviously and

00:06:29.560 --> 00:06:30.810 
the time lighter is better obviously and
then<00:06:29.740> if<00:06:29.860> you're<00:06:30.010> carrying<00:06:30.370> it<00:06:30.430> to<00:06:30.580> and<00:06:30.730> from

00:06:30.810 --> 00:06:30.820 
then if you're carrying it to and from

00:06:30.820 --> 00:06:33.030 
then if you're carrying it to and from
your<00:06:30.970> car<00:06:31.240> loading<00:06:32.050> it<00:06:32.200> unloading<00:06:32.650> it<00:06:32.740> a<00:06:32.770> lot

00:06:33.030 --> 00:06:33.040 
your car loading it unloading it a lot

00:06:33.040 --> 00:06:34.740 
your car loading it unloading it a lot
of<00:06:33.160> women<00:06:33.430> like<00:06:33.610> the<00:06:33.820> brush<00:06:34.210> carbon<00:06:34.600> too

00:06:34.740 --> 00:06:34.750 
of women like the brush carbon too

00:06:34.750 --> 00:06:37.020 
of women like the brush carbon too
because<00:06:35.080> it's<00:06:35.290> just<00:06:36.070> makes<00:06:36.310> life<00:06:36.820> a<00:06:36.940> little

00:06:37.020 --> 00:06:37.030 
because it's just makes life a little

00:06:37.030 --> 00:06:41.190 
because it's just makes life a little
bit<00:06:37.180> easier<00:06:37.240> and<00:06:37.810> this<00:06:38.770> one<00:06:39.010> a<00:06:39.340> blue<00:06:39.880> planet<00:06:40.330> we

00:06:41.190 --> 00:06:41.200 
bit easier and this one a blue planet we

00:06:41.200 --> 00:06:45.120 
bit easier and this one a blue planet we
have<00:06:41.230> it<00:06:41.500> on<00:06:41.620> sale<00:06:41.860> for<00:06:43.050> $23.99<00:06:44.050> all<00:06:44.830> right
