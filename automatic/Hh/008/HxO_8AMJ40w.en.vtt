set yourself apart

00:07:38.160 --> 00:07:40.580 
set yourself apart
I<00:07:38.340> think<00:07:38.820> George<00:07:39.090> likes<00:07:39.360> well-fitted<00:07:40.260> clothes

00:07:40.580 --> 00:07:40.590 
I think George likes well-fitted clothes

00:07:40.590 --> 00:07:43.310 
I think George likes well-fitted clothes
so<00:07:41.460> George<00:07:41.850> might<00:07:42.150> not<00:07:42.390> want<00:07:42.750> to<00:07:42.840> think<00:07:43.170> that

00:07:43.310 --> 00:07:43.320 
so George might not want to think that
