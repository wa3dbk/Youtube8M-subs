sup everybody this is Newark for ninja

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:07.550 
sup everybody this is Newark for ninja
and<00:00:06.060> today<00:00:06.480> I'm<00:00:06.720> gonna<00:00:06.839> show<00:00:07.049> you<00:00:07.140> guys<00:00:07.290> how<00:00:07.529> to

00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:07.560 
and today I'm gonna show you guys how to

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:11.180 
and today I'm gonna show you guys how to
make<00:00:07.770> a<00:00:08.250> very<00:00:08.970> compact<00:00:09.389> design<00:00:09.660> of<00:00:10.170> a<00:00:10.290> three<00:00:10.830> by

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:11.190 
make a very compact design of a three by

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:15.650 
make a very compact design of a three by
two<00:00:11.719> piston<00:00:12.719> door<00:00:12.960> also<00:00:13.679> I<00:00:14.160> will<00:00:14.639> show<00:00:14.940> you<00:00:15.000> how

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:15.660 
two piston door also I will show you how

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:19.599 
two piston door also I will show you how
you<00:00:15.719> can<00:00:15.929> alter<00:00:16.320> it<00:00:16.500> just<00:00:16.890> a<00:00:17.039> bit<00:00:17.630> to<00:00:18.630> make<00:00:18.779> it<00:00:18.840> a

00:00:19.599 --> 00:00:19.609 
you can alter it just a bit to make it a

00:00:19.609 --> 00:00:23.660 
you can alter it just a bit to make it a
2<00:00:20.609> by<00:00:20.760> 2<00:00:20.789> piston<00:00:21.240> door<00:00:21.420> and<00:00:21.660> you<00:00:21.750> seal<00:00:21.990> it<00:00:22.670> so

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:23.670 
2 by 2 piston door and you seal it so

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:27.920 
2 by 2 piston door and you seal it so
you<00:00:23.730> can<00:00:23.850> get<00:00:23.939> all<00:00:24.060> your<00:00:24.180> diamonds<00:00:26.330> so<00:00:27.330> it's<00:00:27.869> a

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:27.930 
you can get all your diamonds so it's a

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:32.240 
you can get all your diamonds so it's a
very<00:00:28.109> simple<00:00:28.410> design<00:00:29.179> I<00:00:30.710> know<00:00:31.710> a<00:00:31.830> lot<00:00:32.009> of<00:00:32.040> you

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:32.250 
very simple design I know a lot of you

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:34.190 
very simple design I know a lot of you
guys<00:00:32.369> probably<00:00:32.430> know<00:00:32.940> how<00:00:33.149> to<00:00:33.180> do<00:00:33.420> this<00:00:33.630> but

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:34.200 
guys probably know how to do this but

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:37.160 
guys probably know how to do this but
probably<00:00:34.739> a<00:00:34.770> much<00:00:35.430> more<00:00:35.730> not<00:00:36.719> as<00:00:36.899> nice<00:00:37.140> looking

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:37.170 
probably a much more not as nice looking

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:39.860 
probably a much more not as nice looking
way<00:00:37.620> you<00:00:37.680> do<00:00:38.010> have<00:00:38.219> to<00:00:38.370> indent<00:00:38.790> the<00:00:39.090> door<00:00:39.570> like

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:39.870 
way you do have to indent the door like

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:42.500 
way you do have to indent the door like
one<00:00:40.200> block<00:00:40.410> in<00:00:40.710> or<00:00:41.550> else<00:00:41.730> you<00:00:42.120> will<00:00:42.210> see<00:00:42.390> the

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.510 
one block in or else you will see the

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:47.959 
one block in or else you will see the
redstone<00:00:43.129> so<00:00:44.129> yeah<00:00:45.050> it's<00:00:46.050> a<00:00:46.140> very<00:00:46.350> nice<00:00:46.969> piston

00:00:47.959 --> 00:00:47.969 
redstone so yeah it's a very nice piston

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:49.610 
redstone so yeah it's a very nice piston
door<00:00:48.120> I<00:00:48.210> may<00:00:48.390> use<00:00:48.629> it<00:00:48.780> in<00:00:48.899> my<00:00:49.020> survival<00:00:49.289> world

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620 
door I may use it in my survival world

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:51.889 
door I may use it in my survival world
so<00:00:50.370> let's<00:00:50.520> just<00:00:50.670> go<00:00:50.820> away<00:00:50.940> a<00:00:51.059> little<00:00:51.390> bit<00:00:51.539> here

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:51.899 
so let's just go away a little bit here

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:56.180 
so let's just go away a little bit here
and<00:00:53.989> I'll<00:00:54.989> make<00:00:55.320> you<00:00:55.410> guys<00:00:55.559> this<00:00:55.890> from<00:00:56.100> scratch

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
and I'll make you guys this from scratch

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:58.760 
and I'll make you guys this from scratch
so<00:00:56.610> what<00:00:56.760> you're<00:00:56.879> gonna<00:00:56.969> need<00:00:57.270> is<00:00:57.329> a<00:00:57.870> piece<00:00:58.620> of

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770 
so what you're gonna need is a piece of

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:02.810 
so what you're gonna need is a piece of
redstone<00:00:58.949> a<00:00:59.690> redstone<00:01:00.690> torch<00:01:00.960> a<00:01:01.820> sticky

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
redstone a redstone torch a sticky

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:06.800 
redstone a redstone torch a sticky
piston<00:01:03.239> a<00:01:04.040> pressure<00:01:05.040> plate<00:01:05.280> any<00:01:05.700> of<00:01:06.360> your

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
piston a pressure plate any of your

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:09.980 
piston a pressure plate any of your
choice<00:01:07.020> and<00:01:07.380> -<00:01:08.340> or<00:01:08.970> one<00:01:09.240> or<00:01:09.510> a<00:01:09.540> couple<00:01:09.689> blocks

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
choice and - or one or a couple blocks

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:12.230 
choice and - or one or a couple blocks
building<00:01:10.710> blocks<00:01:10.920> that<00:01:11.100> you<00:01:11.159> choose<00:01:11.400> I'm<00:01:12.030> just

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
building blocks that you choose I'm just

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:16.160 
building blocks that you choose I'm just
gonna<00:01:12.330> be<00:01:12.540> using<00:01:13.700> sandstone<00:01:14.700> for<00:01:14.880> this<00:01:15.170> so

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
gonna be using sandstone for this so

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:17.390 
gonna be using sandstone for this so
it's<00:01:16.320> easier<00:01:16.530> for<00:01:16.619> you<00:01:16.740> see<00:01:16.860> the<00:01:16.979> redstone

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400 
it's easier for you see the redstone

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:19.399 
it's easier for you see the redstone
those<00:01:18.210> are<00:01:18.330> yeah<00:01:18.420> those<00:01:18.630> are<00:01:18.780> statues<00:01:19.170> of<00:01:19.229> me

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 
those are yeah those are statues of me

gonna want to do is lay down our our

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:35.420 
gonna want to do is lay down our our
door<00:01:31.740> so<00:01:32.579> I'm<00:01:32.909> just<00:01:33.119> gonna<00:01:33.210> make<00:01:33.479> a<00:01:34.280> two<00:01:35.280> by

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430 
door so I'm just gonna make a two by

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:38.270 
door so I'm just gonna make a two by
three<00:01:35.460> one<00:01:35.880> for<00:01:36.090> you<00:01:36.150> guys<00:01:36.210> just<00:01:37.100> because<00:01:38.100> I

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280 
three one for you guys just because I

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:41.240 
three one for you guys just because I
think<00:01:38.430> most<00:01:38.700> of<00:01:38.880> you<00:01:38.939> want<00:01:39.090> to<00:01:39.150> do<00:01:39.270> that<00:01:39.860> so<00:01:40.860> a

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 
think most of you want to do that so a

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:43.550 
think most of you want to do that so a
lot<00:01:41.549> of<00:01:41.640> people<00:01:42.020> think<00:01:43.020> it's<00:01:43.110> a<00:01:43.140> lot<00:01:43.229> easier

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560 
lot of people think it's a lot easier

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:45.139 
lot of people think it's a lot easier
than<00:01:43.710> it<00:01:43.860> actually<00:01:43.890> is<00:01:44.250> doing<00:01:44.670> this<00:01:44.850> because

00:01:45.139 --> 00:01:45.149 
than it actually is doing this because

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:47.090 
than it actually is doing this because
they<00:01:45.479> forget<00:01:45.869> that<00:01:46.590> when<00:01:46.799> you're<00:01:46.920> walking

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100 
they forget that when you're walking

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:50.870 
they forget that when you're walking
through<00:01:47.280> a<00:01:47.430> piston<00:01:47.790> door<00:01:48.000> it's<00:01:48.750> not<00:01:49.460> power<00:01:50.460> the

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880 
through a piston door it's not power the

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:52.609 
through a piston door it's not power the
Pistons<00:01:51.240> aren't<00:01:51.509> powered<00:01:51.960> when<00:01:52.170> you<00:01:52.290> start

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:52.619 
Pistons aren't powered when you start

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:54.830 
Pistons aren't powered when you start
walking<00:01:53.009> through<00:01:53.159> the<00:01:53.220> door<00:01:53.549> the<00:01:54.240> pistons<00:01:54.630> are

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:54.840 
walking through the door the pistons are

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:56.899 
walking through the door the pistons are
powered<00:01:55.680> and<00:01:55.890> they're<00:01:56.040> not<00:01:56.189> powered<00:01:56.759> when

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:56.909 
powered and they're not powered when

00:01:56.909 --> 00:01:58.490 
powered and they're not powered when
you're<00:01:57.030> walking<00:01:57.180> through<00:01:57.509> the<00:01:57.600> door<00:01:57.810> you

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:58.500 
you're walking through the door you

00:01:58.500 --> 00:01:59.719 
you're walking through the door you
probably<00:01:58.680> didn't<00:01:59.009> understand<00:01:59.340> what<00:01:59.460> he<00:01:59.520> just

00:01:59.719 --> 00:01:59.729 
probably didn't understand what he just

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:01.910 
probably didn't understand what he just
said<00:01:59.909> what<00:02:00.540> I'm<00:02:00.659> saying<00:02:00.960> is<00:02:01.200> you<00:02:01.680> have<00:02:01.710> to

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:01.920 
said what I'm saying is you have to

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:04.850 
said what I'm saying is you have to
invert<00:02:02.189> the<00:02:02.430> single<00:02:02.790> because<00:02:03.170> if<00:02:04.170> you<00:02:04.380> come<00:02:04.649> by

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:04.860 
invert the single because if you come by

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:06.560 
invert the single because if you come by
and<00:02:05.130> the<00:02:05.280> Pistons<00:02:05.610> turn<00:02:05.880> on<00:02:06.060> and<00:02:06.270> the<00:02:06.329> blocks

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:06.570 
and the Pistons turn on and the blocks

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:08.389 
and the Pistons turn on and the blocks
are<00:02:06.750> pushed<00:02:06.960> together<00:02:07.170> the<00:02:07.920> blocks<00:02:08.190> are

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:08.399 
are pushed together the blocks are

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:09.919 
are pushed together the blocks are
always<00:02:08.670> pushed<00:02:09.000> together<00:02:09.209> and<00:02:09.599> when<00:02:09.690> you<00:02:09.780> come

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:09.929 
always pushed together and when you come

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:11.809 
always pushed together and when you come
by<00:02:10.050> they<00:02:10.259> open<00:02:10.649> that<00:02:11.129> means<00:02:11.310> the<00:02:11.370> Pistons<00:02:11.700> have

00:02:11.809 --> 00:02:11.819 
by they open that means the Pistons have

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:12.550 
by they open that means the Pistons have
to<00:02:11.910> turn

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:12.560 
to turn

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:14.809 
to turn
so<00:02:13.560> what<00:02:13.739> we're<00:02:13.920> gonna<00:02:14.040> do<00:02:14.310> is<00:02:14.549> we're<00:02:14.730> gonna

00:02:14.809 --> 00:02:14.819 
so what we're gonna do is we're gonna

00:02:14.819 --> 00:02:19.490 
so what we're gonna do is we're gonna
place<00:02:15.810> three<00:02:16.230> pistons<00:02:16.680> like<00:02:16.890> this<00:02:18.349> so<00:02:19.349> this<00:02:19.439> is

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:19.500 
place three pistons like this so this is

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:21.229 
place three pistons like this so this is
not<00:02:19.620> very<00:02:19.980> resource-intensive<00:02:20.549> if<00:02:21.000> you<00:02:21.060> want

00:02:21.229 --> 00:02:21.239 
not very resource-intensive if you want

00:02:21.239 --> 00:02:24.110 
not very resource-intensive if you want
to<00:02:21.299> do<00:02:21.420> this<00:02:21.569> in<00:02:21.840> a<00:02:21.870> survival<00:02:22.439> and<00:02:22.890> then<00:02:23.819> put<00:02:24.090> a

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:24.120 
to do this in a survival and then put a

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:27.369 
to do this in a survival and then put a
block<00:02:24.560> behind<00:02:25.560> the<00:02:25.890> middle<00:02:26.129> piston<00:02:26.579> a

00:02:27.369 --> 00:02:27.379 
block behind the middle piston a

00:02:27.379 --> 00:02:30.500 
block behind the middle piston a
redstone<00:02:28.379> torch<00:02:28.500> I<00:02:28.859> underneath<00:02:29.280> that<00:02:29.549> this

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:30.510 
redstone torch I underneath that this

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:32.179 
redstone torch I underneath that this
redstone<00:02:30.840> torch<00:02:31.170> will<00:02:31.319> power<00:02:31.530> of<00:02:31.769> this<00:02:31.859> block

00:02:32.179 --> 00:02:32.189 
redstone torch will power of this block

00:02:32.189 --> 00:02:34.640 
redstone torch will power of this block
which<00:02:32.430> will<00:02:32.609> power<00:02:32.879> this<00:02:33.180> piston<00:02:33.659> and<00:02:33.870> then

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:34.650 
which will power this piston and then

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:36.050 
which will power this piston and then
this<00:02:34.859> is<00:02:35.040> all<00:02:35.189> you<00:02:35.280> have<00:02:35.400> to<00:02:35.489> do<00:02:35.609> if<00:02:35.730> you<00:02:35.849> wanted

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:36.060 
this is all you have to do if you wanted

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:39.110 
this is all you have to do if you wanted
to<00:02:36.150> do<00:02:36.269> a<00:02:36.299> 2x1<00:02:37.079> door<00:02:37.530> like<00:02:37.829> this<00:02:38.069> if<00:02:38.700> you<00:02:38.969> just

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:39.120 
to do a 2x1 door like this if you just

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:40.750 
to do a 2x1 door like this if you just
want<00:02:39.329> to<00:02:39.359> add<00:02:39.480> the<00:02:39.629> third<00:02:39.810> block<00:02:40.019> higher<00:02:40.290> just

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:40.760 
want to add the third block higher just

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:44.199 
want to add the third block higher just
put<00:02:41.760> a<00:02:41.790> piece<00:02:42.000> of<00:02:42.030> redstone<00:02:42.269> on<00:02:42.569> top<00:02:42.599> and<00:02:43.049> voila

00:02:44.199 --> 00:02:44.209 
put a piece of redstone on top and voila

00:02:44.209 --> 00:02:46.970 
put a piece of redstone on top and voila
so<00:02:45.209> now<00:02:45.359> those<00:02:45.629> are<00:02:45.810> attached<00:02:46.109> so<00:02:46.799> what<00:02:46.889> we

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:46.980 
so now those are attached so what we

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:48.530 
so now those are attached so what we
want<00:02:47.189> to<00:02:47.280> do<00:02:47.400> is<00:02:47.609> make<00:02:47.819> it<00:02:47.849> so<00:02:48.000> when<00:02:48.299> we<00:02:48.329> put

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:48.540 
want to do is make it so when we put

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:51.770 
want to do is make it so when we put
pressure<00:02:48.689> plates<00:02:49.109> here<00:02:50.180> this<00:02:51.180> will<00:02:51.359> open<00:02:51.659> up

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:51.780 
pressure plates here this will open up

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:53.599 
pressure plates here this will open up
and<00:02:51.900> we'll<00:02:51.989> be<00:02:52.079> able<00:02:52.260> to<00:02:52.349> pass<00:02:52.530> through<00:02:52.709> the

00:02:53.599 --> 00:02:53.609 
and we'll be able to pass through the

00:02:53.609 --> 00:02:55.009 
and we'll be able to pass through the
way<00:02:53.730> we're<00:02:53.879> gonna<00:02:53.939> do<00:02:54.180> that<00:02:54.329> is<00:02:54.540> first<00:02:54.780> we're

00:02:55.009 --> 00:02:55.019 
way we're gonna do that is first we're

00:02:55.019 --> 00:02:57.830 
way we're gonna do that is first we're
gonna<00:02:55.109> need<00:02:55.230> to<00:02:55.349> invert<00:02:55.680> the<00:02:55.889> signal<00:02:56.840> by

00:02:57.830 --> 00:02:57.840 
gonna need to invert the signal by

00:02:57.840 --> 00:02:59.869 
gonna need to invert the signal by
sticking<00:02:58.169> a<00:02:58.379> redstone<00:02:58.799> torch<00:02:59.099> underneath

00:02:59.869 --> 00:02:59.879 
sticking a redstone torch underneath

00:02:59.879 --> 00:03:02.780 
sticking a redstone torch underneath
that<00:03:00.150> so<00:03:00.870> that<00:03:00.989> will<00:03:01.109> invert<00:03:01.530> that<00:03:01.790> redstone

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:02.790 
that so that will invert that redstone

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:05.179 
that so that will invert that redstone
torch<00:03:03.439> so<00:03:04.439> we're<00:03:04.560> gonna<00:03:04.650> want<00:03:04.799> to<00:03:04.889> dig<00:03:05.159> a

00:03:05.179 --> 00:03:05.189 
torch so we're gonna want to dig a

00:03:05.189 --> 00:03:09.920 
torch so we're gonna want to dig a
little<00:03:05.430> deeper<00:03:05.879> here<00:03:05.909> I<00:03:08.419> so<00:03:09.419> now<00:03:09.569> we're<00:03:09.780> gonna

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:09.930 
little deeper here I so now we're gonna

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:12.440 
little deeper here I so now we're gonna
want<00:03:10.290> to<00:03:10.379> put<00:03:10.590> a<00:03:10.620> redstone<00:03:10.980> torch<00:03:11.129> there<00:03:11.700> and

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:12.450 
want to put a redstone torch there and

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:15.259 
want to put a redstone torch there and
put<00:03:12.659> redstone<00:03:12.900> here<00:03:13.819> so<00:03:14.819> just<00:03:14.849> do<00:03:15.120> exactly

00:03:15.259 --> 00:03:15.269 
put redstone here so just do exactly

00:03:15.269 --> 00:03:16.879 
put redstone here so just do exactly
that<00:03:15.689> you<00:03:15.989> might<00:03:16.109> not<00:03:16.229> understand<00:03:16.590> why<00:03:16.709> we're

00:03:16.879 --> 00:03:16.889 
that you might not understand why we're

00:03:16.889 --> 00:03:19.520 
that you might not understand why we're
doing<00:03:16.919> this<00:03:17.220> but<00:03:17.569> follow<00:03:18.569> these<00:03:18.870> simple<00:03:19.349> steps

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:19.530 
doing this but follow these simple steps

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:21.619 
doing this but follow these simple steps
correctly<00:03:20.010> we'll<00:03:20.909> be<00:03:21.030> fine

00:03:21.619 --> 00:03:21.629 
correctly we'll be fine

00:03:21.629 --> 00:03:23.750 
correctly we'll be fine
we're<00:03:22.019> gonna<00:03:22.139> do<00:03:22.290> the<00:03:22.409> same<00:03:22.620> exact<00:03:23.250> thing<00:03:23.400> on

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:23.760 
we're gonna do the same exact thing on

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:26.629 
we're gonna do the same exact thing on
this<00:03:23.909> side<00:03:24.479> so<00:03:25.109> right<00:03:25.349> under<00:03:25.650> that<00:03:25.799> torch<00:03:26.430> we

00:03:26.629 --> 00:03:26.639 
this side so right under that torch we

00:03:26.639 --> 00:03:28.250 
this side so right under that torch we
want<00:03:26.849> to<00:03:26.940> invert<00:03:27.239> that<00:03:27.540> with<00:03:27.720> another<00:03:27.930> torch

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:28.260 
want to invert that with another torch

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:33.229 
want to invert that with another torch
and<00:03:29.569> then<00:03:30.569> we're<00:03:30.900> gonna<00:03:31.019> want<00:03:31.379> to<00:03:32.090> put<00:03:33.090> a

00:03:33.229 --> 00:03:33.239 
and then we're gonna want to put a

00:03:33.239 --> 00:03:35.960 
and then we're gonna want to put a
redstone<00:03:33.659> torch<00:03:33.780> there<00:03:34.319> and<00:03:34.849> connect<00:03:35.849> them

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:35.970 
redstone torch there and connect them

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:40.009 
redstone torch there and connect them
with<00:03:36.090> redstone<00:03:37.069> all<00:03:38.069> right<00:03:38.459> or<00:03:39.000> that<00:03:39.150> whoops

00:03:40.009 --> 00:03:40.019 
with redstone all right or that whoops

00:03:40.019 --> 00:03:41.360 
with redstone all right or that whoops
scratch<00:03:40.439> out<00:03:40.620> that's<00:03:40.859> not<00:03:40.949> we're<00:03:41.129> supposed<00:03:41.340> to

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:41.370 
scratch out that's not we're supposed to

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:44.149 
scratch out that's not we're supposed to
do<00:03:41.699> make<00:03:42.090> sure<00:03:42.239> that's<00:03:42.419> lowered<00:03:42.989> and<00:03:43.259> then<00:03:43.889> put

00:03:44.149 --> 00:03:44.159 
do make sure that's lowered and then put

00:03:44.159 --> 00:03:48.330 
do make sure that's lowered and then put
the<00:03:44.400> stuff

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:48.340 

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:52.570 

all<00:03:49.340> right<00:03:49.870> so<00:03:50.870> that<00:03:51.230> is<00:03:51.470> pretty<00:03:51.769> much<00:03:51.890> the

00:03:52.570 --> 00:03:52.580 
all right so that is pretty much the

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:55.600 
all right so that is pretty much the
only<00:03:52.610> kind<00:03:53.540> of<00:03:53.720> complicated<00:03:54.349> part<00:03:54.590> now<00:03:55.310> all

00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:55.610 
only kind of complicated part now all

00:03:55.610 --> 00:03:58.330 
only kind of complicated part now all
you<00:03:55.819> have<00:03:56.000> to<00:03:56.180> do<00:03:56.390> is<00:03:56.799> connect<00:03:57.799> the<00:03:57.860> redstone

00:03:58.330 --> 00:03:58.340 
you have to do is connect the redstone

00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:02.020 
you have to do is connect the redstone
to<00:03:58.489> where<00:03:58.610> you<00:03:58.730> want<00:03:58.940> it<00:03:59.150> so<00:04:00.760> what<00:04:01.760> I'm<00:04:01.879> gonna

00:04:02.020 --> 00:04:02.030 
to where you want it so what I'm gonna

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:05.319 
to where you want it so what I'm gonna
do<00:04:02.299> is<00:04:02.540> I'm<00:04:03.110> just<00:04:03.170> gonna<00:04:03.379> connect<00:04:03.860> these<00:04:04.329> like

00:04:05.319 --> 00:04:05.329 
do is I'm just gonna connect these like

00:04:05.329 --> 00:04:11.250 
do is I'm just gonna connect these like
so<00:04:05.659> and<00:04:07.030> then<00:04:08.030> we<00:04:08.150> can<00:04:08.299> just<00:04:08.510> put<00:04:08.720> uh<00:04:09.250> get<00:04:10.250> grass

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:11.260 
so and then we can just put uh get grass

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:13.750 
so and then we can just put uh get grass
we<00:04:12.260> don't<00:04:12.409> actually<00:04:12.799> yeah<00:04:12.920> I<00:04:13.129> was<00:04:13.310> gonna<00:04:13.489> make

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:13.760 
we don't actually yeah I was gonna make

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:15.160 
we don't actually yeah I was gonna make
it<00:04:13.909> out<00:04:14.030> of<00:04:14.060> that<00:04:14.239> sense<00:04:14.540> um<00:04:14.750> but<00:04:14.959> doesn't

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:15.170 
it out of that sense um but doesn't

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:17.590 
it out of that sense um but doesn't
matter<00:04:15.260> anymore<00:04:16.000> so<00:04:17.000> then<00:04:17.150> you<00:04:17.299> can<00:04:17.449> just

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:17.600 
matter anymore so then you can just

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:20.289 
matter anymore so then you can just
cover<00:04:17.989> that<00:04:18.199> up<00:04:18.609> put<00:04:19.609> your<00:04:19.760> pressure<00:04:19.970> plate

00:04:20.289 --> 00:04:20.299 
cover that up put your pressure plate

00:04:20.299 --> 00:04:26.529 
cover that up put your pressure plate
down<00:04:20.510> and<00:04:22.479> it<00:04:23.479> opens<00:04:23.810> for<00:04:24.139> you<00:04:24.289> and<00:04:25.330> then<00:04:26.330> the

00:04:26.529 --> 00:04:26.539 
down and it opens for you and then the

00:04:26.539 --> 00:04:28.330 
down and it opens for you and then the
other<00:04:26.660> side<00:04:26.960> to<00:04:27.320> make<00:04:27.470> it<00:04:27.590> work<00:04:27.770> is<00:04:27.979> very

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:28.340 
other side to make it work is very

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:31.680 
other side to make it work is very
simple<00:04:28.880> and<00:04:29.000> easy<00:04:29.180> all<00:04:29.510> you<00:04:29.539> need<00:04:29.900> to<00:04:30.020> do<00:04:30.169> is

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:31.690 
simple and easy all you need to do is

00:04:31.690 --> 00:04:34.270 
simple and easy all you need to do is
connect<00:04:32.690> that<00:04:32.990> to<00:04:33.050> the<00:04:33.289> other<00:04:33.530> side<00:04:33.740> so<00:04:34.039> those

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:34.280 
connect that to the other side so those

00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:37.870 
connect that to the other side so those
just<00:04:34.310> hop<00:04:34.639> down<00:04:34.669> here<00:04:35.030> so<00:04:35.150> it's<00:04:35.270> easier<00:04:36.880> so

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:37.880 
just hop down here so it's easier so

00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:39.189 
just hop down here so it's easier so
we're<00:04:38.240> gonna<00:04:38.360> make<00:04:38.600> it<00:04:38.690> go<00:04:38.810> all<00:04:38.990> the<00:04:39.110> way<00:04:39.139> over

00:04:39.189 --> 00:04:39.199 
we're gonna make it go all the way over

00:04:39.199 --> 00:04:44.020 
we're gonna make it go all the way over
there<00:04:39.669> just<00:04:40.669> connect<00:04:41.090> all<00:04:41.240> this<00:04:42.729> fill<00:04:43.729> it<00:04:43.850> back

00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:44.030 
there just connect all this fill it back

00:04:44.030 --> 00:04:47.830 
there just connect all this fill it back
up<00:04:44.830> and<00:04:45.830> now<00:04:46.010> we'll<00:04:46.160> put<00:04:46.370> our<00:04:46.510> pressure<00:04:47.510> plates

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:47.840 
up and now we'll put our pressure plates

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:52.779 
up and now we'll put our pressure plates
back<00:04:48.080> down<00:04:49.990> put<00:04:50.990> it<00:04:51.050> on<00:04:51.139> this<00:04:51.260> side<00:04:51.470> also<00:04:51.789> and

00:04:52.779 --> 00:04:52.789 
back down put it on this side also and

00:04:52.789 --> 00:04:57.159 
back down put it on this side also and
then<00:04:53.300> you<00:04:53.330> can<00:04:53.539> just<00:04:53.690> walk<00:04:53.870> right<00:04:54.110> through<00:04:56.169> the

00:04:57.159 --> 00:04:57.169 
then you can just walk right through the

00:04:57.169 --> 00:04:58.450 
then you can just walk right through the
reason<00:04:57.500> why<00:04:57.620> we're<00:04:57.800> not<00:04:57.830> putting<00:04:58.220> them<00:04:58.430> right

00:04:58.450 --> 00:04:58.460 
reason why we're not putting them right

00:04:58.460 --> 00:05:00.640 
reason why we're not putting them right
up<00:04:58.880> against<00:04:59.300> it<00:04:59.450> we<00:04:59.599> could<00:04:59.870> if<00:04:59.990> we<00:05:00.020> wanted<00:05:00.320> to

00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:00.650 
up against it we could if we wanted to

00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:02.860 
up against it we could if we wanted to
and<00:05:00.830> it<00:05:00.919> would<00:05:01.010> still<00:05:01.250> work<00:05:01.490> it<00:05:02.389> just<00:05:02.570> takes<00:05:02.750> a

00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:02.870 
and it would still work it just takes a

00:05:02.870 --> 00:05:05.830 
and it would still work it just takes a
second<00:05:03.229> for<00:05:03.349> it<00:05:03.380> to<00:05:03.530> work<00:05:03.650> so<00:05:04.240> you<00:05:05.240> get<00:05:05.510> push<00:05:05.690> up

00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:05.840 
second for it to work so you get push up

00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:08.219 
second for it to work so you get push up
against<00:05:06.110> it

00:05:08.219 --> 00:05:08.229 
against it

00:05:08.229 --> 00:05:10.900 
against it
you<00:05:09.229> can<00:05:09.350> fiddle<00:05:09.500> around<00:05:09.650> this<00:05:10.039> design<00:05:10.400> it's

00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:10.910 
you can fiddle around this design it's

00:05:10.910 --> 00:05:12.640 
you can fiddle around this design it's
not<00:05:11.330> my<00:05:11.479> own<00:05:11.600> design<00:05:11.900> I<00:05:11.930> forgot<00:05:12.500> where<00:05:12.620> I

00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:12.650 
not my own design I forgot where I

00:05:12.650 --> 00:05:14.170 
not my own design I forgot where I
learned<00:05:12.889> it<00:05:12.979> from<00:05:13.009> but<00:05:13.430> somebody<00:05:13.970> else

00:05:14.170 --> 00:05:14.180 
learned it from but somebody else

00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:16.930 
learned it from but somebody else
definitely<00:05:14.750> that<00:05:14.840> it's<00:05:15.080> very<00:05:15.410> simple<00:05:15.940> hope
