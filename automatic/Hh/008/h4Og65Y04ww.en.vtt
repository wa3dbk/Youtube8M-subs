00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:06.330
 hello guys with you as always I 

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:12.120
 lion x and today we are starting a new one 

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:13.830
 subject called the review self-made 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:17.310
 little people that is 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:19.560
 these little men I will do it myself 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:22.699
 have them be either in my coloring 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:25.410
 either in there in the configuration is very such 

00:00:22.699 --> 00:00:29.970
 special and very cool so they 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:33.680
 turned out well let's get down first 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:35.329
 man this is a zombie cop 

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:40.500
 mutated 

00:00:35.329 --> 00:00:45.059
 of course the back is made by me 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:46.320
 of course there is no such thing that 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:52.020
 was there. 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:54.840
 back hands day as you see yes 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:58.920
 that is, his head is uneven that to me 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:01:01.410
 love and here's a little eye 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:05.820
 there is an eye there is an ordinary freak ordinary 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:11.510
 eyebrow usually have such an eye that type 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:11.510
 knocked out the most to blood 

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:21.509
 let's make a turn again and 

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:25.490
 proceed with the other figures Well 

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:28.070
 let's watch the following and here we are 

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:33.420
 next figure 

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:38.090
 here is such another policeman 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:44.750
 but already mutated a little bit differently 

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:48.060
 he is as you see already stronger that 

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:54.500
 means that it will be very hard 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:02:01.500
 kill because he has as we can see 

00:01:54.500 --> 00:02:03.030
 armor armor is quite comfortable and good 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:07.259
 so that 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:11.090
 there will be no constrained movements and so 

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:13.100
 let's say this is such a very dangerous enemy 

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:16.020
 on 

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:18.180
 how do we see the place of his hand 

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:24.090
 grows on growth 

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:26.730
 the sword that is so that he can spike 

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:27.920
 accelerate and just cut you on 

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:34.440
 small pieces 

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:36.440
 let's do the opposite and get down to 

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:39.959
 next figure 

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:45.840
 the following figure is also done by me me 

00:02:39.959 --> 00:02:48.350
 she likes it most because it is 

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:55.590
 like a survivor 

00:02:48.350 --> 00:03:00.180
 with a machine gun behind such a briefcase then 

00:02:55.590 --> 00:03:04.620
 eat he can eat water 

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:07.860
 so on all that is useful to him from above 

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:13.680
 on the head as we can see fiery 

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:18.120
 skull in hand and not machine gun machine gun on 

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:22.049
 then we take a closer look, we can still 

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:25.920
 watch what our hero has 

00:03:22.049 --> 00:03:32.030
 gauze bandage but it may not 

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:36.480
 wear a gas mask i'm sorry 

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:38.549
 hesitated at all can not wear 

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:42.890
 gas mask because he has gauze 

00:03:38.549 --> 00:03:45.450
 bandage it will be easier to carry the smell 

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:50.549
 decomposing meat and that is 

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:52.769
 corpses of zombies and so on Well 

00:03:50.549 --> 00:03:56.400
 let's start the review 

00:03:52.769 --> 00:04:00.350
 him in machine gun in general guys i 

00:03:56.400 --> 00:04:06.660
 prepared to make such a stand 

00:04:00.350 --> 00:04:13.070
 let's take a closer look at it like this 

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:13.070
 looks like our survivor 's machine gun with you 

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:18.850
 i.e 

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:24.310
 he accordingly has 

00:04:18.850 --> 00:04:28.480
 butt definitely not butt stand then 

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:34.150
 have it calmly can take any for 

00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:37.630
 he is comfortable even uncomfortable position which 

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:42.340
 get caught and shoot quietly from 

00:04:37.630 --> 00:04:47.770
 Zombies accordingly have a butt there 

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:55.120
 for convenience of transfer, now the handle is well 

00:04:47.770 --> 00:05:00.900
 here it is here as we saw before that 

00:04:55.120 --> 00:05:06.330
 that he is very comfortable holding his 

00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:09.850
 machine gun because at the expense of these pens 

00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:12.280
 I made a bigger chair because 

00:05:09.850 --> 00:05:15.910
 without a trunk without it, he looked 

00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:18.040
 much worse actually know guys 

00:05:15.910 --> 00:05:21.669
 a moment dark but now there is now 

00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:24.540
 turn on the light is not clear why we have 

00:05:21.669 --> 00:05:32.860
 just in St. Petersburg the weather is overcast 

00:05:24.540 --> 00:05:38.100
 better not better how will not all the same 

00:05:32.860 --> 00:05:38.100
 better learn on well here is such a machine gun and 

00:05:38.310 --> 00:05:47.169
 let's proceed to the next figure but 

00:05:42.820 --> 00:05:50.200
 our next hero looks like this 

00:05:47.169 --> 00:05:56.790
 I think many people have already guessed what 

00:05:50.200 --> 00:06:00.910
 I 'm sorry so let's say the breed 

00:05:56.790 --> 00:06:05.800
 I completed the terminator 

00:06:00.910 --> 00:06:09.270
 on terminator man but not 

00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:13.390
 I knew how to make such a body before 

00:06:09.270 --> 00:06:17.350
 I had to cut two bodies in front of myself 

00:06:13.390 --> 00:06:20.229
 very tin how long ago and yourself 

00:06:17.350 --> 00:06:23.010
 look at what result man 

00:06:20.229 --> 00:06:25.510
 made almost just perfect 

00:06:23.010 --> 00:06:26.820
 the only minus of this little man is 

00:06:25.510 --> 00:06:29.650
 this one 

00:06:26.820 --> 00:06:33.020
 yes that is 

00:06:29.650 --> 00:06:36.560
 it's a little uneven but i think you tell me 

00:06:33.020 --> 00:06:39.789
 sorry because all the same as winlock 

00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:43.550
 the figure is wonderful and in my opinion 

00:06:39.789 --> 00:06:48.050
 but post comments that he 

00:06:43.550 --> 00:06:53.169
 I liked that he did not like what 

00:06:48.050 --> 00:06:56.620
 you still want yes today I will release 

00:06:53.169 --> 00:07:00.770
 I will sell the review on the house 

00:06:56.620 --> 00:07:04.150
 Well, in general, it's all guys, thank you all for 

00:07:00.770 --> 00:07:04.150
 view all bye
