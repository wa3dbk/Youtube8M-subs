00:00:06.309 --> 00:00:06.319 
it's now time to scribe presumably out

00:00:06.319 --> 00:00:08.170 
it's now time to scribe presumably out
to<00:00:06.740> the<00:00:06.890> side<00:00:07.550> of<00:00:07.640> the<00:00:07.700> wall

00:00:08.170 --> 00:00:08.180 
to the side of the wall

00:00:08.180 --> 00:00:12.129 
to the side of the wall
yes<00:00:08.780> well<00:00:09.220> the<00:00:10.220> easiest<00:00:10.849> way<00:00:11.059> to<00:00:11.090> do<00:00:11.450> it<00:00:11.599> on<00:00:11.809> an

00:00:12.129 --> 00:00:12.139 
yes well the easiest way to do it on an

00:00:12.139 --> 00:00:14.680 
yes well the easiest way to do it on an
attached<00:00:12.559> to<00:00:12.799> board<00:00:13.070> like<00:00:13.370> this<00:00:13.400> of<00:00:13.849> a<00:00:14.330> dark

00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:14.690 
attached to board like this of a dark

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:18.100 
attached to board like this of a dark
color<00:00:15.080> is<00:00:15.679> to<00:00:15.919> put<00:00:16.100> some<00:00:16.340> masking<00:00:16.910> tape<00:00:17.110> where

00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:18.110 
color is to put some masking tape where

00:00:18.110 --> 00:00:21.220 
color is to put some masking tape where
you<00:00:18.350> expecting<00:00:19.160> the<00:00:19.250> screw<00:00:19.520> out<00:00:19.550> to<00:00:19.850> be<00:00:20.230> so

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:21.230 
you expecting the screw out to be so

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:23.230 
you expecting the screw out to be so
when<00:00:21.470> you<00:00:21.650> put<00:00:21.860> the<00:00:21.950> masking<00:00:22.340> tape<00:00:22.550> on<00:00:22.730> the<00:00:22.820> end

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:23.240 
when you put the masking tape on the end

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:26.440 
when you put the masking tape on the end
of<00:00:23.360> the<00:00:23.450> board<00:00:24.040> what<00:00:25.040> I<00:00:25.070> do<00:00:25.310> is<00:00:25.760> cut<00:00:26.090> a<00:00:26.120> length

00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:26.450 
of the board what I do is cut a length

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:29.470 
of the board what I do is cut a length
of<00:00:26.600> timber<00:00:27.110> with<00:00:27.380> Potok<00:00:28.010> that<00:00:28.760> gives<00:00:29.090> me<00:00:29.300> a

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:29.480 
of timber with Potok that gives me a

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:33.540 
of timber with Potok that gives me a
specific<00:00:30.200> point<00:00:30.590> on<00:00:30.950> the<00:00:31.520> wall<00:00:32.079> which

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:33.550 
specific point on the wall which

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:37.840 
specific point on the wall which
absolutely<00:00:34.550> lines<00:00:34.910> up<00:00:35.180> with<00:00:36.249> the<00:00:37.249> line<00:00:37.460> they

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:37.850 
absolutely lines up with the line they

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:40.869 
absolutely lines up with the line they
will<00:00:38.089> draw<00:00:38.390> on<00:00:39.019> to<00:00:39.440> the<00:00:39.499> timber<00:00:39.980> now<00:00:40.820> the

00:00:40.869 --> 00:00:40.879 
will draw on to the timber now the

00:00:40.879 --> 00:00:43.419 
will draw on to the timber now the
reason<00:00:41.420> I<00:00:41.480> put<00:00:41.510> a<00:00:41.719> point<00:00:42.050> is<00:00:42.320> if<00:00:42.589> he<00:00:42.980> used<00:00:43.219> it

00:00:43.419 --> 00:00:43.429 
reason I put a point is if he used it

00:00:43.429 --> 00:00:44.829 
reason I put a point is if he used it
that<00:00:43.579> way<00:00:43.850> that<00:00:44.089> would<00:00:44.359> give<00:00:44.510> me<00:00:44.659> the

00:00:44.829 --> 00:00:44.839 
that way that would give me the

00:00:44.839 --> 00:00:47.590 
that way that would give me the
multitude<00:00:45.469> of<00:00:45.800> readings<00:00:46.670> where<00:00:47.300> is<00:00:47.390> it<00:00:47.510> you

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:47.600 
multitude of readings where is it you

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:49.720 
multitude of readings where is it you
put<00:00:47.780> a<00:00:47.809> point<00:00:48.109> on<00:00:48.350> it<00:00:48.409> to<00:00:48.649> lighten<00:00:48.890> up<00:00:49.100> it<00:00:49.429> gives

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:49.730 
put a point on it to lighten up it gives

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:54.610 
put a point on it to lighten up it gives
you<00:00:49.850> a<00:00:49.879> specific<00:00:50.629> point<00:00:51.129> so<00:00:52.129> if<00:00:52.489> we<00:00:52.670> mark<00:00:53.620> the

00:00:54.610 --> 00:00:54.620 
you a specific point so if we mark the

00:00:54.620 --> 00:01:12.960 
you a specific point so if we mark the
board<00:00:57.460> across

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:12.970 

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:16.660 

okay<00:01:13.970> like<00:01:14.240> so<00:01:14.570> down<00:01:15.530> who<00:01:15.710> can<00:01:15.890> cut<00:01:16.070> it<00:01:16.250> with<00:01:16.490> a

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:16.670 
okay like so down who can cut it with a

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:19.929 
okay like so down who can cut it with a
jigsaw<00:01:17.180> fantastic<00:01:18.170> and<00:01:18.770> I<00:01:19.280> noticed<00:01:19.759> that

00:01:19.929 --> 00:01:19.939 
jigsaw fantastic and I noticed that

00:01:19.939 --> 00:01:22.179 
jigsaw fantastic and I noticed that
you've<00:01:20.030> got<00:01:20.180> a<00:01:20.210> little<00:01:20.509> groove<00:01:21.170> notched<00:01:21.830> into

00:01:22.179 --> 00:01:22.189 
you've got a little groove notched into

00:01:22.189 --> 00:01:26.289 
you've got a little groove notched into
the<00:01:22.280> back<00:01:22.490> of<00:01:22.670> that<00:01:23.740> scribing<00:01:24.770> yes<00:01:25.430> what<00:01:26.000> what

00:01:26.289 --> 00:01:26.299 
the back of that scribing yes what what

00:01:26.299 --> 00:01:27.999 
the back of that scribing yes what what
it's<00:01:26.450> hard<00:01:26.630> to<00:01:26.720> do<00:01:26.930> is<00:01:27.200> put<00:01:27.409> a<00:01:27.439> little<00:01:27.799> groove

00:01:27.999 --> 00:01:28.009 
it's hard to do is put a little groove

00:01:28.009 --> 00:01:31.149 
it's hard to do is put a little groove
in<00:01:28.250> the<00:01:28.369> back<00:01:28.549> to<00:01:28.939> locate<00:01:29.420> my<00:01:30.020> pencil<00:01:30.619> it<00:01:30.830> just

00:01:31.149 --> 00:01:31.159 
in the back to locate my pencil it just

00:01:31.159 --> 00:01:34.990 
in the back to locate my pencil it just
makes<00:01:31.430> the<00:01:31.820> 8<00:01:32.450> nice<00:01:33.259> need<00:01:33.649> for<00:01:34.340> the<00:01:34.429> pencil<00:01:34.909> to

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:35.000 
makes the 8 nice need for the pencil to

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.480 
makes the 8 nice need for the pencil to
just<00:01:35.210> stay<00:01:35.420> in<00:01:35.450> exactly<00:01:35.990> the<00:01:36.140> same<00:01:36.170> place<00:01:36.950> so

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:37.490 
just stay in exactly the same place so

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:39.990 
just stay in exactly the same place so
now<00:01:37.640> we're<00:01:37.820> going<00:01:37.939> to<00:01:38.000> use<00:01:38.149> a<00:01:38.179> jigsaw<00:01:38.869> to<00:01:39.590> cut

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:40.000 
now we're going to use a jigsaw to cut

00:01:40.000 --> 00:02:22.560 
now we're going to use a jigsaw to cut
along<00:01:41.000> this<00:01:41.299> scribed<00:01:41.720> edge

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:22.570 

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:24.790 

rightly<00:02:23.570> I<00:02:23.690> noticed<00:02:24.050> there<00:02:24.260> you<00:02:24.440> were<00:02:24.500> using

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:24.800 
rightly I noticed there you were using

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:27.400 
rightly I noticed there you were using
the<00:02:24.860> jigsaw<00:02:25.250> upside<00:02:26.240> down<00:02:26.600> why<00:02:26.990> would<00:02:27.200> you<00:02:27.260> do

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:27.410 
the jigsaw upside down why would you do

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:27.910 
the jigsaw upside down why would you do
that

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:27.920 
that

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:30.430 
that
the<00:02:28.340> reason<00:02:28.640> I<00:02:28.730> use<00:02:28.910> the<00:02:29.030> jigsaw<00:02:29.510> upside<00:02:30.110> down

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:30.440 
the reason I use the jigsaw upside down

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:32.740 
the reason I use the jigsaw upside down
is<00:02:30.740> because<00:02:31.640> this<00:02:31.820> is<00:02:31.970> a<00:02:32.000> face<00:02:32.300> and<00:02:32.630> it's

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:32.750 
is because this is a face and it's

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:35.800 
is because this is a face and it's
texted<00:02:33.380> and<00:02:33.590> it's<00:02:33.860> the<00:02:34.040> completed<00:02:34.580> board<00:02:34.850> if<00:02:35.600> I

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:35.810 
texted and it's the completed board if I

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:38.080 
texted and it's the completed board if I
use<00:02:36.050> the<00:02:36.290> jigsaw<00:02:36.740> this<00:02:37.010> way<00:02:37.280> it<00:02:37.550> could<00:02:37.910> have<00:02:38.060> a

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:38.090 
use the jigsaw this way it could have a

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:41.230 
use the jigsaw this way it could have a
possibility<00:02:38.600> to<00:02:38.840> spell<00:02:39.380> stored<00:02:39.920> up<00:02:40.250> which<00:02:40.910> you

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:41.240 
possibility to spell stored up which you

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:45.400 
possibility to spell stored up which you
don't<00:02:41.480> want<00:02:41.570> so<00:02:42.440> what<00:02:42.770> I<00:02:42.800> you<00:02:43.730> do<00:02:44.240> is<00:02:44.510> use<00:02:45.170> the

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:45.410 
don't want so what I you do is use the

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:48.490 
don't want so what I you do is use the
jigsaw<00:02:45.890> upside<00:02:46.640> down<00:02:46.970> so<00:02:47.360> if<00:02:47.630> there's<00:02:47.870> a<00:02:48.020> spell

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:48.500 
jigsaw upside down so if there's a spell

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:51.850 
jigsaw upside down so if there's a spell
T's<00:02:48.770> on<00:02:48.980> the<00:02:49.310> board<00:02:49.960> they<00:02:50.960> are<00:02:51.140> to<00:02:51.320> the<00:02:51.410> bottom

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:51.860 
T's on the board they are to the bottom

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:54.700 
T's on the board they are to the bottom
of<00:02:52.040> the<00:02:52.520> board<00:02:52.730> and<00:02:53.120> won't<00:02:53.420> be<00:02:53.510> seen<00:02:53.780> so<00:02:54.470> we've

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:54.710 
of the board and won't be seen so we've

00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:58.390 
of the board and won't be seen so we've
now<00:02:54.970> refitted<00:02:55.970> the<00:02:56.000> first<00:02:56.870> board<00:02:57.230> and<00:02:57.500> we've

00:02:58.390 --> 00:02:58.400 
now refitted the first board and we've

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:00.700 
now refitted the first board and we've
taken<00:02:59.030> the<00:02:59.270> masking<00:02:59.780> tape<00:02:59.810> off<00:03:00.140> the<00:03:00.560> end

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:00.710 
taken the masking tape off the end

00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:02.860 
taken the masking tape off the end
that's<00:03:01.070> been<00:03:01.250> scribed<00:03:01.700> yeah<00:03:02.300> and<00:03:02.600> we're<00:03:02.720> all

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:02.870 
that's been scribed yeah and we're all
