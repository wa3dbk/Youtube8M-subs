about<00:01:30.570> seven<00:01:31.350> eight<00:01:31.500> people<00:01:31.890> in<00:01:31.979> the<00:01:32.009> show<00:01:32.250> or

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
about seven eight people in the show or

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:34.910 
about seven eight people in the show or
whatever<00:01:32.640> and<00:01:33.170> over<00:01:34.170> here<00:01:34.380> we<00:01:34.530> have<00:01:34.560> kind<00:01:34.890> of

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920 
whatever and over here we have kind of

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:37.910 
whatever and over here we have kind of
cross<00:01:35.189> between<00:01:35.430> a<00:01:35.790> rate<00:01:36.210> dirt<00:01:36.630> from<00:01:37.409> stargate

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
cross between a rate dirt from stargate

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:40.310 
cross between a rate dirt from stargate
atlantis<00:01:37.950> and<00:01:38.640> a<00:01:39.210> colonial<00:01:39.689> Viper<00:01:39.960> from

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320 
atlantis and a colonial Viper from

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:41.899 
atlantis and a colonial Viper from
Battlestar<00:01:40.710> Galactica<00:01:41.189> I<00:01:41.310> think<00:01:41.520> personally

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:41.909 
Battlestar Galactica I think personally

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:44.300 
Battlestar Galactica I think personally
looks<00:01:42.240> more<00:01:42.450> like<00:01:42.600> a<00:01:42.630> colonial<00:01:43.200> Viper<00:01:43.470> but

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310 
looks more like a colonial Viper but

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:45.469 
looks more like a colonial Viper but
