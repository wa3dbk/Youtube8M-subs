fairies and trolls but this was pretty

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:13.190 
fairies and trolls but this was pretty
cool<00:04:11.670> because<00:04:11.880> they're<00:04:12.239> all<00:04:12.450> gathered<00:04:12.870> in<00:04:12.989> one

place it's like this hidden refuge where

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:20.150 
place it's like this hidden refuge where
it's<00:04:17.010> a<00:04:17.220> haven<00:04:17.609> for<00:04:18.510> these<00:04:19.100> for<00:04:20.100> these

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:20.160 
it's a haven for these for these

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:22.969 
it's a haven for these for these
creatures<00:04:20.580> and<00:04:21.000> they<00:04:21.840> have<00:04:22.019> a<00:04:22.049> caretaker<00:04:22.710> and

00:04:22.969 --> 00:04:22.979 
creatures and they have a caretaker and

00:04:22.979 --> 00:04:24.860 
creatures and they have a caretaker and
there<00:04:23.130> are<00:04:23.250> ancient<00:04:23.460> rules<00:04:23.970> that<00:04:24.419> find<00:04:24.690> them

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:24.870 
there are ancient rules that find them

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:25.360 
there are ancient rules that find them
into<00:04:25.050> play

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:25.370 
into play

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:26.350 
into play
so<00:04:25.760> I<00:04:25.820> thought<00:04:25.970> that<00:04:26.120> was<00:04:26.210> a<00:04:26.270> really

00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:26.360 
so I thought that was a really

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:29.379 
so I thought that was a really
interesting<00:04:26.630> twist<00:04:27.470> on<00:04:27.620> a<00:04:28.070> kind<00:04:28.790> of<00:04:28.910> common

00:04:29.379 --> 00:04:29.389 
interesting twist on a kind of common

00:04:29.389 --> 00:04:31.570 
interesting twist on a kind of common
plotline<00:04:29.900> that<00:04:30.110> authors<00:04:30.440> use<00:04:30.680> a<00:04:30.710> lot<00:04:30.979> that's

00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:31.580 
plotline that authors use a lot that's

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:34.150 
plotline that authors use a lot that's
what<00:04:31.760> I<00:04:31.790> liked<00:04:32.090> about<00:04:32.180> this<00:04:32.419> book<00:04:32.740> am<00:04:33.740> I<00:04:33.979> really

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:34.160 
what I liked about this book am I really

believe in resolving you know one one

00:05:38.120 --> 00:05:44.230 
believe in resolving you know one one
thing<00:05:38.330> at<00:05:38.419> a<00:05:38.479> time<00:05:38.680> so<00:05:39.680> a<00:05:40.070> couple<00:05:40.970> um<00:05:43.240> there

00:05:44.230 --> 00:05:44.240 
thing at a time so a couple um there

00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:46.120 
thing at a time so a couple um there
were<00:05:44.720> definitely<00:05:45.110> a<00:05:45.200> couple<00:05:45.560> of<00:05:45.620> loose<00:05:45.830> ends

00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:46.130 
were definitely a couple of loose ends

00:05:46.130 --> 00:05:48.310 
were definitely a couple of loose ends
at<00:05:46.639> the<00:05:47.120> end<00:05:47.210> of<00:05:47.389> this<00:05:47.479> book<00:05:47.690> but<00:05:47.870> the<00:05:47.930> main

00:05:48.310 --> 00:05:48.320 
at the end of this book but the main

00:05:48.320 --> 00:05:50.879 
at the end of this book but the main
plot<00:05:49.250> and<00:05:49.520> the<00:05:49.550> main<00:05:49.849> problem<00:05:50.450> was<00:05:50.630> resolved

00:05:50.879 --> 00:05:50.889 
plot and the main problem was resolved

00:05:50.889 --> 00:05:54.460 
plot and the main problem was resolved
so<00:05:51.889> I<00:05:52.310> was<00:05:52.910> satisfied<00:05:53.180> with<00:05:53.510> the<00:05:53.750> ending<00:05:54.080> but<00:05:54.410> i

00:05:54.460 --> 00:05:54.470 
so I was satisfied with the ending but i

00:05:54.470 --> 00:05:56.680 
so I was satisfied with the ending but i
do<00:05:54.590> want<00:05:55.070> more<00:05:55.310> so<00:05:55.820> that<00:05:55.849> was<00:05:56.090> definitely<00:05:56.360> a

00:05:56.680 --> 00:05:56.690 
do want more so that was definitely a

00:05:56.690 --> 00:06:01.060 
do want more so that was definitely a
pro<00:05:56.990> cons<00:05:58.599> it<00:05:59.599> was<00:05:59.840> maybe<00:06:00.139> a<00:06:00.289> little<00:06:00.530> bit<00:06:00.770> slow

00:06:01.060 --> 00:06:01.070 
pro cons it was maybe a little bit slow

00:06:01.070 --> 00:06:02.680 
pro cons it was maybe a little bit slow
in<00:06:01.099> the<00:06:01.280> beginning<00:06:01.430> I<00:06:01.820> don't<00:06:01.880> think<00:06:02.060> the<00:06:02.240> real

00:06:02.680 --> 00:06:02.690 
in the beginning I don't think the real

00:06:02.690 --> 00:06:05.469 
in the beginning I don't think the real
real<00:06:03.139> action<00:06:04.039> picked<00:06:04.639> up<00:06:04.820> until<00:06:05.000> the<00:06:05.270> middle

00:06:05.469 --> 00:06:05.479 
real action picked up until the middle

00:06:05.479 --> 00:06:08.920 
real action picked up until the middle
but<00:06:06.169> when<00:06:06.380> I<00:06:06.410> say<00:06:06.680> slow<00:06:07.099> I<00:06:07.849> still<00:06:08.630> really

00:06:08.920 --> 00:06:08.930 
but when I say slow I still really

00:06:08.930 --> 00:06:13.120 
but when I say slow I still really
wanted<00:06:09.260> to<00:06:09.380> read<00:06:09.560> it<00:06:09.710> so<00:06:10.810> and<00:06:11.810> i<00:06:12.260> thought<00:06:12.440> the

00:06:13.120 --> 00:06:13.130 
wanted to read it so and i thought the

00:06:13.130 --> 00:06:15.159 
wanted to read it so and i thought the
beginning<00:06:13.430> was<00:06:13.550> very<00:06:13.580> interesting<00:06:14.389> as<00:06:14.570> you

00:06:18.700 --> 00:06:18.710 
creatures that stayed there before maybe

00:06:18.710 --> 00:06:23.439 
creatures that stayed there before maybe
you<00:06:18.919> actually<00:06:19.099> met<00:06:19.520> the<00:06:19.550> characters<00:06:20.120> so<00:06:22.449> that
