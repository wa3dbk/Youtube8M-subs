top-level<00:00:52.750> parts<00:00:53.380> this<00:00:53.650> isn't<00:00:54.040> exact<00:00:54.610> yet<00:00:54.970> but

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:55.180 
top-level parts this isn't exact yet but

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:57.240 
top-level parts this isn't exact yet but
it's<00:00:55.330> fairly<00:00:55.600> close<00:00:55.930> so<00:00:56.500> we<00:00:56.650> at<00:00:56.860> least<00:00:56.890> wanted

00:00:57.240 --> 00:00:57.250 
it's fairly close so we at least wanted

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:02.770 
right now this chainstay length is right

00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:06.300 
right now this chainstay length is right
at<00:01:02.950> 435<00:01:03.730> so<00:01:04.449> a<00:01:04.479> nice<00:01:04.780> nice<00:01:05.229> tight<00:01:05.560> rear<00:01:05.799> end<00:01:06.009> so

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:16.090 
tube with these these shapes that we

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:17.999 
tube with these these shapes that we
have<00:01:16.270> is<00:01:16.509> pretty<00:01:16.899> much<00:01:17.109> a<00:01:17.170> diamond<00:01:17.619> shape<00:01:17.829> both

00:01:17.999 --> 00:01:18.009 
have is pretty much a diamond shape both

00:01:18.009 --> 00:01:21.359 
have is pretty much a diamond shape both
down<00:01:18.249> to<00:01:18.460> the<00:01:18.640> top<00:01:18.850> tube<00:01:19.179> and<00:01:20.109> then<00:01:20.409> the<00:01:20.799> Fox

00:01:21.359 --> 00:01:21.369 
down to the top tube and then the Fox

00:01:21.369 --> 00:01:23.520 
down to the top tube and then the Fox
fork<00:01:21.759> that<00:01:22.090> that's<00:01:22.630> one<00:01:22.899> of<00:01:22.990> our<00:01:23.079> favorite

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:23.530 
fork that that's one of our favorite

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:26.609 
fork that that's one of our favorite
favorite<00:01:23.799> forks<00:01:24.130> and<00:01:24.280> then<00:01:24.460> the<00:01:25.439> rapid<00:01:26.439> rob

00:01:26.609 --> 00:01:26.619 
favorite forks and then the rapid rob

00:01:26.619 --> 00:01:28.499 
favorite forks and then the rapid rob
tire<00:01:26.950> so<00:01:27.369> these<00:01:27.579> are<00:01:27.789> these<00:01:28.119> are<00:01:28.149> some<00:01:28.299> items

00:01:28.499 --> 00:01:28.509 
tire so these are these are some items

00:01:28.509 --> 00:01:30.510 
tire so these are these are some items
that<00:01:28.719> will<00:01:28.960> stay<00:01:29.259> on<00:01:29.439> the<00:01:29.560> bike<00:01:29.710> and<00:01:29.950> I<00:01:30.100> believe

00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:30.520 
that will stay on the bike and I believe

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:32.279 
that will stay on the bike and I believe
it<00:01:30.700> will<00:01:30.819> stay<00:01:31.060> with<00:01:31.179> a<00:01:31.240> Richie<00:01:31.569> cockpit<00:01:32.170> and

00:01:32.279 --> 00:01:32.289 
it will stay with a Richie cockpit and

00:01:32.289 --> 00:01:34.379 
it will stay with a Richie cockpit and
the<00:01:32.380> WTB<00:01:32.979> saddle<00:01:33.399> there<00:01:33.729> may<00:01:33.850> be<00:01:33.880> some<00:01:34.179> minor

00:01:34.379 --> 00:01:34.389 
the WTB saddle there may be some minor

00:01:34.389 --> 00:01:36.029 
the WTB saddle there may be some minor
changes<00:01:34.869> on<00:01:35.049> on<00:01:35.409> some<00:01:35.679> of<00:01:35.740> the<00:01:35.799> drivetrain

00:01:36.029 --> 00:01:36.039 
changes on on some of the drivetrain

00:01:36.039 --> 00:01:39.590 
changes on on some of the drivetrain
items<00:01:36.729> but<00:01:36.850> overall<00:01:37.149> this<00:01:37.869> bike<00:01:38.130> will<00:01:39.130> be

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:39.600 
items but overall this bike will be

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:41.910 
items but overall this bike will be
really<00:01:40.600> fun<00:01:40.630> for<00:01:40.869> us<00:01:41.109> to<00:01:41.229> have<00:01:41.380> this<00:01:41.619> this
