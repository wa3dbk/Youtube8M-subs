for release beginning from line three

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:24.320 
for release beginning from line three
until<00:00:21.750> the<00:00:21.900> end<00:00:22.020> of<00:00:22.080> the<00:00:22.230> page<00:00:22.470> I<00:00:23.090> will<00:00:24.090> go<00:00:24.240> over

until the end of the page I will go over

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:27.259 
until the end of the page I will go over
the<00:00:24.750> note<00:00:24.900> names<00:00:25.109> with<00:00:25.289> you<00:00:25.560> and<00:00:26.119> keep<00:00:27.119> in<00:00:27.240> mind

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:27.269 
the note names with you and keep in mind

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:29.839 
the note names with you and keep in mind
that<00:00:27.689> we<00:00:28.289> do<00:00:28.529> move<00:00:28.769> up<00:00:28.980> into<00:00:29.220> the<00:00:29.460> treble<00:00:29.820> clef

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:29.849 
that we do move up into the treble clef

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:32.299 
that we do move up into the treble clef
region<00:00:30.570> the<00:00:30.900> left<00:00:31.140> hand<00:00:31.349> actually<00:00:31.590> crosses

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:32.309 
region the left hand actually crosses

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:34.700 
region the left hand actually crosses
over<00:00:32.610> the<00:00:32.640> right<00:00:32.790> hand<00:00:33.239> so<00:00:34.050> we<00:00:34.230> will<00:00:34.410> have<00:00:34.559> to

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:34.710 
over the right hand so we will have to

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:37.520 
over the right hand so we will have to
slow<00:00:35.160> down<00:00:35.370> a<00:00:35.430> bit<00:00:35.610> to<00:00:36.270> move<00:00:36.630> the<00:00:36.870> camera<00:00:37.320> so

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:37.530 
slow down a bit to move the camera so

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:38.600 
slow down a bit to move the camera so
you<00:00:37.559> can<00:00:37.680> see<00:00:38.040> the<00:00:38.219> notes

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:38.610 
you can see the notes

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:40.880 
you can see the notes
so<00:00:39.210> let's<00:00:39.480> bear<00:00:39.750> through<00:00:40.020> this<00:00:40.140> together<00:00:40.379> and

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890 
so let's bear through this together and

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:42.650 
so let's bear through this together and
I<00:00:41.280> will<00:00:41.340> give<00:00:41.670> you<00:00:41.850> the<00:00:42.030> steps<00:00:42.270> you<00:00:42.420> need<00:00:42.450> to

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:42.660 
I will give you the steps you need to

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:45.920 
I will give you the steps you need to
learn<00:00:43.379> the<00:00:43.590> left<00:00:43.800> hand<00:00:44.040> correctly<00:00:44.930> for

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:45.930 
learn the left hand correctly for

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:49.810 
learn the left hand correctly for
