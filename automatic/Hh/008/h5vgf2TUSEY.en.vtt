 Attention flap recording runs hello and 

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:10.620
 Welcome to the series and 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:14.820
 Now there is the lottery draw 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:17.310

 with my little luck that went on gaming 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:25.260
 insight and the draw to do it 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:27.060
 we are here today on my channel 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:28.349
 We 've been running this for a whole week 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:29.640
 let's say it delivers or set 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:31.109
 thursday is already one 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:34.230
 a bit late when uploading 

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:36.540
 better late for punctual than first 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:38.600
 push on the next day so first 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:41.610
 a few facts have watched the video 

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:44.879

 in total there were 554 this had 

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:47.610
 compete so still has to practice here with 

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:51.360
 webcam 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:53.219

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:55.079
 Thanks again over that 

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:56.579
 network feedback and so you can with 

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:58.170
 then you know if that's the people 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:01.980
 like it or not 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:02.910
 a total of 1476 comments 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:05.670
 submitted 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:08.720
 that means we will now of these 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:11.790
 comments to a winner who then 

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:14.909
 following and this assassin's creed 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:16.710
 3 collector's edition figures blame for 

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:18.750
 on the desk and in addition or there 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:21.390
 On top of that, there's again 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:25.290
 Assassin's creed 3 in the xbox 360 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:26.820
 version for one of you out there 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:29.670
 that would like to have 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:31.170
 so how do we determine if you are me 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:32.100
 should follow on 'youtube' the 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:33.869
 certainly already seen 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:37.829
 we use a random number generator here 

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:39.600
 and now choose one of these pages 

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:43.590
 so with her downstairs sometimes that can be 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:46.710
 see at 1476 comments are just 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:48.149
 Exactly 148 page wind comments on 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:50.220
 every youtube page is 10 comments 

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:53.130
 and those on the first are helped then 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:55.140
 accordingly only six so and me 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:57.740
 Now generate a number and that is 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:02:00.630
 the quasi the winning side 

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:02.520
 that's the page 106 that was clear 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:04.820
 the page 25 could be normal now 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:06.830
 namely, do not leaf through it 

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:09.070
 we have to do something like this 

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:11.900
 unfortunately now have to go to page 106 

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:13.700
 before clicking 

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:15.950
 yes there is no possibility no 

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:18.190
 option to give one here though 

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:20.720
 that always with the patch number 

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:22.430
 is displayed and so on normally 

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:23.930
 that does not work sometimes 

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:26.000
 youtube played a bit to 

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:28.760
 then you have to show more 

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:32.990
 that's 11 next, too 

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:35.300
 page 27 30 that could of course say 

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:36.410
 regrets that long the sirius goes 

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:38.959
 we do not think so 

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:40.940
 chosen but rather so numerous 

00:02:38.959 --> 00:02:44.450
 been through what we do here then 

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:46.040
 I think that's a good motivation 

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:47.330
 I could say one now 

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:48.980
 then again and again 

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:55.430
 gambling maybe at the time 

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:57.080
 or with me if you are up 

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:59.900
 landed this video then you have 

00:02:57.080 --> 00:03:02.060
 probably also the de / news at gaming 

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:03.530
 time already seen where I am not so today 

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:05.090
 I had many themes in general 

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:10.640
 chosen as a big topic 

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:12.200
 crysis 3 crysis 3 clever engaged and 

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:14.049
 this is still the topic of the big issue 

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:16.070
 black Ops 2 

00:03:14.049 --> 00:03:17.570
 then there are also different 

00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:18.470
 News about our super 

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:20.450
 little things 

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:22.459
 then I thought so because I am so 

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:24.110
 Talked a lot about black ops 2 

00:03:22.459 --> 00:03:26.450
 or a lot with crysis 3 

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:28.370
 if it would be interesting so daily 

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:29.690
 add news special times and you 

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:32.090
 really complete only one 

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:34.640
 anyway you triple a title as well 

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:37.640
 many hotels and triple play called 

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:39.680
 to be the absolute top player of the 

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:43.060
 respective poplar social of hessen 

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:45.680
 street is for example triple a title 

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:46.970
 he if that would be interesting for you though 

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:48.500
 from time to time such a special shipment 

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:50.390
 that makes you really just about one 

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:52.700
 individual title many things 

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:54.200
 packed together and also quiet in the title 

00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:55.910
 who already smells where yes that in the 

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:57.380
 afterwards again discusses human who 

00:03:55.910 --> 00:03:58.660
 Did you like it we will like it 

00:03:57.380 --> 00:04:03.470

00:03:58.660 --> 00:04:04.100
 now on the winning side 160 

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:06.530
 and 6 

00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:08.269
 You can see that the winning side 

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:10.020
 this zone is 6 and now we are 

00:04:08.269 --> 00:04:11.760
 here on the 100th 

00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:13.650
