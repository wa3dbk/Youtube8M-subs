00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:10.969
 it is important to create a good interface 

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:13.340
 for a game because the interface must 

00:00:10.969 --> 00:00:14.830
 be at the height of the video game is 

00:00:13.340 --> 00:00:17.450
 say must convey a certain 

00:00:14.830 --> 00:00:19.540
 continuity of what is aesthetics and 

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:23.149
 the story that is telling in general 

00:00:19.540 --> 00:00:25.640
 the game and the setting in the majority 

00:00:23.149 --> 00:00:27.230
 of today's games because the 

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:30.430
 we use so that for configuration 

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:33.739
 of weapons skills characters 

00:00:30.430 --> 00:00:35.390
 inventory usage and for example 

00:00:33.739 --> 00:00:37.790
 Typical hacks to show information 

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:39.140
 up the game system so 

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:41.690
 we both spend a lot of time with them 

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:43.190
 interacting with them what do you want 

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:45.800
 say then that the use of these 

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:47.750
 interfaces let's say it has to be very 

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:50.330
 intuitive and transmit a good 

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:52.490
 experience so that the score 

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:54.530
 let's say general of the whole game is not 

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:55.960
 see harmed by the use of an evil 

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:57.790
 Interface 

00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:59.950
 when designing an interface there is 

00:00:57.790 --> 00:01:02.020
 that follow the same guidelines we have 

00:00:59.950 --> 00:01:04.269
 always focused interactivity 

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:06.340
 when you use that ability, that is, you have to 

00:01:04.269 --> 00:01:08.710
 try to do it the most intuitive 

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:10.540
 possible to make the user think what 

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:12.070
 less possible do not have to memorize the 

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:14.500
 steps when it comes to reaching a site to 

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:15.880
 another and also another one of the steps 

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:17.950
 important is also to take into account 

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:19.180
 the device to which you are going to focus 

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:21.790
 ie today we have 

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:24.479
 touch screens devices 

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:26.409
 peripherals for motion capture 

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:28.720
 depends on the device you go to 

00:01:26.409 --> 00:01:31.210
 focused we will have to work sizes 

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:33.220
 readability of elements to try 

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:35.380
 convey this user experience 

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:37.960
 the best possible when it comes to programming 

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:39.490
 the videogame interfaces what 

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:42.670
 which is mainly used is that the 

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:44.649
 report this rendering engine what 

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:47.200
 What helps us is to be able to 

00:01:44.649 --> 00:01:48.550
 abstract almost completely the design the 

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:51.369
 development and treatment of 

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:54.800
 assets of the interfaces using flash 

00:01:51.369 --> 00:01:57.650
 already has script 2.0 or three points 

00:01:54.800 --> 00:02:00.590
 in this way let's say that the team 

00:01:57.650 --> 00:02:02.930
 development can work in a 

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:05.150
 independent working the whole subject of 

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:06.680
 functionalities internally and then 

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:09.290
 integrate it into the game once 

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:11.540
 inside the game we can put it inside 

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:14.090
 of using a texture by applying a 

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:16.730
 polygon and use interfaces as per 

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:19.160
 example the game of space 3 in which 

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:20.600
 we have interactive menus in 3d of 

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:22.730
 agreement or put it directly by 

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:25.190
 over without using the motor 

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:26.390
 trent from the game itself today 

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:29.780
 many of the games we have 

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:33.560
 currently use different supports 

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:35.810
 and support devices like many 

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:38.960
 Sometimes it happens even tablets and mobiles to 

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:41.360
 the time to be able to expand the context of 

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:43.460
 the game experience an example of 

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:46.390
 this could be for example skyrim that 

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:48.620
 yes we can use the game 

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:50.960
 interacting with the map being able to put 

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:53.780
 small notes about him in our 

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:56.750
 ipad and so we do not have to leave the 

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:58.190
 game and focus not only are we going to 

00:02:56.750 --> 00:03:00.380
 We can use the two devices to 

00:02:58.190 --> 00:03:02.870
 the time another one of these examples could be 

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:04.880
 maybe gta 5 with the application that 

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:06.680
 has of live fruit that what we can 

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:08.810
 do that is can you study the cars 

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:11.180
 that we have gotten our game and 

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:13.640
 even train the pet that 

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:16.430
 our heading appears directly and 

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:18.920
 then all this progress we see it we see 

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:20.630
 the results in our game of 

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:21.890
 this way what we do is that expand 

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:25.370
 the experience is to say we have 

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:27.080
 different tactile devices 

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:29.300
 capture of movement what is done is 

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:31.340
 not just focus on the pad but 

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:33.500
 different different peripherals 

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:37.390
 devices and expand especially in the 

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:37.390
 context of use of the game in general
