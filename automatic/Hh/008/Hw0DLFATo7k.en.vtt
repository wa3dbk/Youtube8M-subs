beyond burberry it's welcoming in and
sort<00:01:28.460> of<00:01:28.870> easy<00:01:29.870> so<00:01:30.710> it's<00:01:30.890> nice

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:00.510 

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:03.950 

played<00:02:01.510> a<00:02:01.540> lot<00:02:01.780> of<00:02:01.810> really<00:02:02.080> hot<00:02:02.230> places<00:02:02.500> now<00:02:02.800> I

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:03.960 
played a lot of really hot places now I

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:06.570 
played a lot of really hot places now I
think<00:02:04.960> it<00:02:05.200> actually<00:02:05.350> is<00:02:05.650> a<00:02:05.680> benefit<00:02:06.220> you<00:02:06.460> know

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:06.580 
think it actually is a benefit you know

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:08.310 
think it actually is a benefit you know
just<00:02:06.850> if<00:02:07.090> you<00:02:07.180> just<00:02:07.210> allow<00:02:07.480> the<00:02:07.600> heat<00:02:07.900> to<00:02:07.960> take

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:08.320 
just if you just allow the heat to take

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:09.900 
just if you just allow the heat to take
over<00:02:08.679> and<00:02:08.830> allow<00:02:09.130> it<00:02:09.280> to<00:02:09.310> do<00:02:09.520> what<00:02:09.670> it<00:02:09.759> does

00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:09.910 
over and allow it to do what it does

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:12.270 
over and allow it to do what it does
which<00:02:10.149> is<00:02:10.179> like<00:02:10.509> loosen<00:02:10.929> things<00:02:11.080> up<00:02:11.350> you<00:02:12.250> know

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:12.280 
which is like loosen things up you know

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:15.390 
which is like loosen things up you know
and<00:02:12.640> let<00:02:12.820> it<00:02:12.850> and<00:02:13.450> almost<00:02:14.080> sort<00:02:14.530> of<00:02:14.650> once<00:02:15.280> it

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:15.400 
and let it and almost sort of once it

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:17.160 
and let it and almost sort of once it
starts<00:02:15.670> to<00:02:15.820> match<00:02:15.970> your<00:02:16.240> body<00:02:16.450> heat<00:02:16.780> it's<00:02:17.020> like
