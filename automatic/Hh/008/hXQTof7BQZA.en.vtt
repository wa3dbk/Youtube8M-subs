finger<00:03:56.710> spine<00:03:57.190> play<00:03:57.400> technology<00:03:57.640> yeah<00:03:58.360> which

00:03:58.590 --> 00:03:58.600 
finger spine play technology yeah which

00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:00.240 
finger spine play technology yeah which
i<00:03:58.720> think<00:03:58.780> is<00:03:59.020> a<00:03:59.050> great<00:03:59.200> addition<00:03:59.530> you<00:04:00.070> can

00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:00.250 
i think is a great addition you can

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:01.980 
i think is a great addition you can
remove<00:04:00.490> it<00:04:00.700> if<00:04:00.790> you<00:04:00.940> want<00:04:01.120> total<00:04:01.330> freedom<00:04:01.630> put

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:01.990 
remove it if you want total freedom put

00:04:01.990 --> 00:04:03.570 
remove it if you want total freedom put
in<00:04:02.080> one<00:04:02.200> finger<00:04:02.410> two<00:04:02.800> fingers<00:04:02.830> whatever<00:04:03.280> got

00:04:03.570 --> 00:04:03.580 
in one finger two fingers whatever got

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:04.949 
in one finger two fingers whatever got
some<00:04:03.700> injuries<00:04:04.030> before<00:04:04.150> so<00:04:04.510> I<00:04:04.540> think<00:04:04.630> that's<00:04:04.900> a

00:04:04.949 --> 00:04:04.959 
some injuries before so I think that's a

00:04:04.959 --> 00:04:07.800 
some injuries before so I think that's a
really<00:04:05.260> great<00:04:05.410> addition<00:04:05.820> I<00:04:06.820> love<00:04:07.540> the<00:04:07.630> fact
