00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
hero3 the audio quality is not so good

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:54.080 
hero3 the audio quality is not so good
so<00:00:50.539> what<00:00:51.539> you<00:00:51.660> have<00:00:51.809> to<00:00:51.930> do<00:00:52.170> is<00:00:52.969> use<00:00:53.969> an

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.090 
so what you have to do is use an

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:55.880 
so what you have to do is use an
external<00:00:54.360> mic<00:00:54.690> to<00:00:55.110> get<00:00:55.260> really<00:00:55.500> good<00:00:55.620> audio

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
external mic to get really good audio

00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:00.979 
external mic to get really good audio
quality<00:00:56.510> which<00:00:57.510> is<00:00:57.690> fine<00:00:59.449> but<00:01:00.449> on<00:01:00.750> the<00:01:00.870> other

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989 
quality which is fine but on the other

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:04.340 
quality which is fine but on the other
hand<00:01:01.760> you<00:01:02.760> might<00:01:02.940> also<00:01:03.120> have<00:01:03.809> noticed<00:01:04.229> that

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 
hand you might also have noticed that

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:05.870 
hand you might also have noticed that
the<00:01:04.680> battery<00:01:05.040> life<00:01:05.250> on<00:01:05.369> these<00:01:05.519> things<00:01:05.700> aren't

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
the battery life on these things aren't

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:07.750 
the battery life on these things aren't
so<00:01:06.060> great<00:01:06.240> either

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:07.760 
so great either

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:12.440 
so great either
so<00:01:08.760> for<00:01:09.119> audio<00:01:09.450> I<00:01:09.950> got<00:01:10.950> a<00:01:10.979> rode<00:01:11.420> videomic<00:01:12.420> pro

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
so for audio I got a rode videomic pro

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:16.899 
so for audio I got a rode videomic pro
that<00:01:13.320> I<00:01:13.380> plan<00:01:13.590> to<00:01:13.619> use<00:01:14.270> I've<00:01:15.270> got<00:01:15.600> one<00:01:16.290> of<00:01:16.380> these

00:01:16.899 --> 00:01:16.909 
that I plan to use I've got one of these

00:01:16.909 --> 00:01:22.340 
that I plan to use I've got one of these
USB<00:01:17.909> adapters<00:01:20.180> now<00:01:21.180> plug<00:01:21.540> in<00:01:21.570> to<00:01:21.930> the<00:01:22.049> side

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
USB adapters now plug in to the side

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:27.280 
USB adapters now plug in to the side
plug<00:01:23.040> into<00:01:23.250> the<00:01:23.400> USB<00:01:23.430> port<00:01:23.790> and<00:01:24.890> then<00:01:25.890> plugs<00:01:26.220> in

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:27.290 
plug into the USB port and then plugs in

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:30.760 
plug into the USB port and then plugs in
to<00:01:28.290> the<00:01:28.409> three<00:01:28.740> to<00:01:28.890> five<00:01:29.040> millimeter<00:01:29.490> jack

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:30.770 
to the three to five millimeter jack

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:32.660 
to the three to five millimeter jack
so<00:01:31.770> I<00:01:31.799> can<00:01:31.979> use<00:01:32.130> a<00:01:32.159> really<00:01:32.430> high-quality

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670 
so I can use a really high-quality

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:36.319 
so I can use a really high-quality
shotgun<00:01:33.450> mic<00:01:34.549> one<00:01:35.549> of<00:01:35.670> my<00:01:35.729> out<00:01:35.820> recording

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:36.329 
shotgun mic one of my out recording

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:39.600 
stuff I get good 4k video and good high

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:43.219 
stuff I get good 4k video and good high
quality<00:01:40.020> audio<00:01:41.420> the<00:01:42.420> problem<00:01:42.750> with<00:01:42.840> this<00:01:42.960> is

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:43.229 
quality audio the problem with this is

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:45.969 
quality audio the problem with this is
that<00:01:43.920> the<00:01:44.369> battery<00:01:44.610> life<00:01:44.939> being<00:01:45.180> not<00:01:45.420> so<00:01:45.630> great

00:01:45.969 --> 00:01:45.979 
that the battery life being not so great

00:01:45.979 --> 00:01:48.319 
that the battery life being not so great
when<00:01:46.979> you've<00:01:47.100> got<00:01:47.310> this<00:01:47.460> thing<00:01:47.700> plugged<00:01:48.090> into

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:48.329 
when you've got this thing plugged into

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:52.010 
when you've got this thing plugged into
the<00:01:48.479> USB<00:01:48.509> port<00:01:49.430> you<00:01:50.430> can't<00:01:50.759> use<00:01:51.420> an<00:01:51.540> external

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020 
the USB port you can't use an external

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:55.190 
the USB port you can't use an external
battery<00:01:52.140> pack<00:01:52.820> which<00:01:53.820> I<00:01:53.939> use<00:01:54.240> often<00:01:54.600> with

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200 
battery pack which I use often with

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:59.740 
battery pack which I use often with
something<00:01:55.500> like<00:01:55.649> this

00:01:59.740 --> 00:01:59.750 

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:06.499 

the<00:02:00.750> USB<00:02:01.200> plug<00:02:01.320> I<00:02:02.929> can<00:02:03.929> plug<00:02:04.229> it<00:02:04.350> in<00:02:05.000> to<00:02:06.000> the<00:02:06.090> USB

00:02:06.499 --> 00:02:06.509 
the USB plug I can plug it in to the USB

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:17.000 
the USB plug I can plug it in to the USB
pack<00:02:09.140> and<00:02:12.319> plug<00:02:13.319> that<00:02:13.349> in<00:02:13.800> to<00:02:13.830> charge<00:02:16.010> the

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:17.010 
pack and plug that in to charge the

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:20.930 
pack and plug that in to charge the
GoPro<00:02:18.920> but<00:02:19.920> as<00:02:20.040> you<00:02:20.129> can<00:02:20.280> tell<00:02:20.459> the<00:02:20.580> problem

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:20.940 
GoPro but as you can tell the problem

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:22.720 
GoPro but as you can tell the problem
here<00:02:21.150> is<00:02:21.239> that<00:02:21.450> there's<00:02:21.660> only<00:02:21.720> one<00:02:21.989> USB<00:02:22.140> port

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:22.730 
here is that there's only one USB port

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:25.130 
here is that there's only one USB port
you<00:02:23.730> can<00:02:23.849> only<00:02:24.000> use<00:02:24.239> the<00:02:24.360> microphone<00:02:24.810> or<00:02:25.019> the

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:25.140 
you can only use the microphone or the

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:29.390 
you can only use the microphone or the
USB<00:02:25.349> battery<00:02:25.709> not<00:02:26.549> both<00:02:27.470> so<00:02:28.470> the<00:02:28.890> solution

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:29.400 
USB battery not both so the solution

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:35.120 
USB battery not both so the solution
that<00:02:29.430> I<00:02:29.580> have<00:02:29.760> for<00:02:29.940> this<00:02:31.370> is<00:02:33.950> one<00:02:34.950> of<00:02:35.010> these

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:35.130 
that I have for this is one of these

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:38.930 
that I have for this is one of these
battery<00:02:35.549> backpacks<00:02:36.090> GoPro<00:02:36.780> makes<00:02:36.989> one<00:02:37.940> this

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:38.940 
battery backpacks GoPro makes one this

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:42.670 
battery backpacks GoPro makes one this
one<00:02:39.150> that<00:02:39.299> I<00:02:39.329> have<00:02:39.420> is<00:02:39.660> made<00:02:39.840> by<00:02:39.959> wasabi<00:02:40.410> power

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:42.680 
one that I have is made by wasabi power

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:44.930 
one that I have is made by wasabi power
they<00:02:43.680> look<00:02:43.890> pretty<00:02:44.160> much<00:02:44.250> exactly<00:02:44.640> the<00:02:44.849> same

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:44.940 
they look pretty much exactly the same

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:48.830 
they look pretty much exactly the same
this<00:02:45.510> one<00:02:45.750> adds<00:02:46.079> another<00:02:47.060> 1260<00:02:48.060> milliamp

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:48.840 
this one adds another 1260 milliamp

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:51.979 
this one adds another 1260 milliamp
hours<00:02:49.549> so<00:02:50.549> all<00:02:50.700> you<00:02:50.819> do<00:02:50.940> is<00:02:51.150> you<00:02:51.269> strap<00:02:51.720> it<00:02:51.750> on

00:02:51.979 --> 00:02:51.989 
hours so all you do is you strap it on

00:02:51.989 --> 00:02:54.460 
hours so all you do is you strap it on
like<00:02:52.230> you<00:02:52.260> would<00:02:52.620> any<00:02:52.980> other<00:02:53.250> backpack

00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:54.470 
like you would any other backpack

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:57.229 
like you would any other backpack
there's<00:02:55.470> a<00:02:55.560> hook<00:02:55.860> on<00:02:55.920> the<00:02:56.310> side<00:02:56.340> hook<00:02:57.000> it<00:02:57.120> on

there's a hook on the side hook it on

00:02:57.239 --> 00:02:59.210 
there's a hook on the side hook it on
this<00:02:57.420> works<00:02:57.690> for<00:02:57.870> the<00:02:57.989> for<00:02:58.319> both<00:02:58.500> the<00:02:58.680> Hero<00:02:58.980> 3

00:02:59.210 --> 00:02:59.220 
this works for the for both the Hero 3

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:06.349 
this works for the for both the Hero 3
and<00:02:59.519> the<00:02:59.670> hero<00:02:59.910> 4<00:03:03.139> now<00:03:04.139> you've<00:03:04.350> got<00:03:05.090> more<00:03:06.090> power

00:03:06.349 --> 00:03:06.359 
and the hero 4 now you've got more power

00:03:06.359 --> 00:03:08.840 
and the hero 4 now you've got more power
to<00:03:07.049> go<00:03:07.170> for<00:03:07.350> longer<00:03:07.620> so<00:03:08.130> if<00:03:08.250> you<00:03:08.370> didn't<00:03:08.609> want

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:08.850 
to go for longer so if you didn't want

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:11.240 
to go for longer so if you didn't want
to<00:03:08.940> be<00:03:09.780> tied<00:03:10.019> down<00:03:10.200> to<00:03:10.260> a<00:03:10.470> big<00:03:10.709> battery<00:03:10.980> you

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:11.250 
to be tied down to a big battery you

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:12.319 
to be tied down to a big battery you
don't<00:03:11.400> have<00:03:11.549> to<00:03:11.700> be<00:03:11.790> you<00:03:11.940> just<00:03:12.000> plug<00:03:12.299> your

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:31.760 

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:34.309 

of<00:03:32.760> course<00:03:33.030> this<00:03:33.150> is<00:03:33.329> kind<00:03:33.540> of<00:03:33.659> awkward<00:03:34.290> to

00:03:34.309 --> 00:03:34.319 
of course this is kind of awkward to

00:03:34.319 --> 00:03:37.759 
of course this is kind of awkward to
hold<00:03:34.620> and<00:03:35.150> the<00:03:36.150> ability<00:03:36.900> that<00:03:36.930> it<00:03:37.170> takes<00:03:37.409> away

00:03:37.759 --> 00:03:37.769 
hold and the ability that it takes away

00:03:37.769 --> 00:03:40.849 
hold and the ability that it takes away
now<00:03:38.040> with<00:03:38.099> this<00:03:38.370> battery<00:03:38.790> BacPac<00:03:39.389> is<00:03:39.829> that<00:03:40.829> I

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:49.449 
can use my LCD BacPac so the only other
alternative<00:03:45.510> is<00:03:46.469> to<00:03:46.709> use<00:03:46.739> the<00:03:47.099> GoPro<00:03:47.579> app
