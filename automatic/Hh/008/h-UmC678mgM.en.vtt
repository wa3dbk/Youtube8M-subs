00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.950
 hi everyone how are you today I'm going to 

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:08.460
 prepare baskets with chicken and vegetables 

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:10.950
 for this first of all we have two 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:13.650
 chicken breasts and first we're going to 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:16.640
 we are going to cook it to cook the 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:20.270
 breast in a pot with boiling water 

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:23.210
 I add some peppercorns 

00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:25.689
 black 

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:25.689
 Salt 

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:33.940
 and two breasts 

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:36.400
 when the water comes back to boil I'm going to 

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:40.230
 lower the fire and I will cook these 

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:40.230
 breasts for 30 minutes 

00:00:40.579 --> 00:00:47.800
 once the breasts are cooled the 

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:47.800
 cut into cubes 

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:56.390
 here are two breasts 

00:00:52.220 --> 00:01:00.040
 to this he added two tomatoes 

00:00:56.390 --> 00:01:00.040
 also cut in cubes 

00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:11.770
 I add vegetables I have red morrÃ³n 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:14.370
 I also have asparagus and mushrooms 

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:20.850
 if you do not have asparagus for example 

00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:20.850
 can be peas or corn we add 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:28.340
 I'm also vegetable 

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:28.340
 and I mix 

00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:35.020
 I'm not going to add salt because the breast 

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:36.760
 chicken already has salt and I will use 

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:38.690
 also mozzarella cheese that is pretty 

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:41.090
 salty 

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:43.610
 that's going to be our this one is going to be 

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:46.120
 our filling 

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:51.350
 to bake the baskets I'm going to use 

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:53.860
 this mold here added oil and I'll go 

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:53.860
 oil 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:57.500
 so that we do not get stuck 

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:09.120
 this mold is already quite use has 

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:16.230
 and this notice that as silicone does not 

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:21.740
 it washes with nothing good that we need 

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:21.740
 now I use these tapas for empanadas 

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:28.209
 they come like this I do not know in other countries if you 

00:02:26.379 --> 00:02:31.019
 they sell if they can not use for example 

00:02:28.209 --> 00:02:31.019
 puff pastry 

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:36.189
 here the argentinas are sold 

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:42.080
 stage is called for empanadas good 

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:42.080
 let's take 1 

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:48.410
 and what I 'm going to do is form 

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:54.730
 the basket 

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:54.730
 we do that 

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:08.980
 and we put it in the mold 

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:13.530
 if we do it without mold 

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:13.530
 they may not keep their shape after 

00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:19.310
 now we place the filling in each mold 

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:46.769
 and over we put mozzarella cheese 

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:56.940
 the only condiment I use is oregano 

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:56.940
 dry 

00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:05.170
 and the oven I have preheated to 180 

00:04:02.210 --> 00:04:05.170
 degrees 

00:04:06.850 --> 00:04:11.670
 and the time about half an hour 

00:04:12.569 --> 00:04:18.959
 we can also make triangles 

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:21.590
 we took the dough we placed it was injured in 

00:04:18.959 --> 00:04:21.590
 center 

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:27.410
 mozzarella cheese 

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:37.400
 and we started to close 

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:37.400
 on the one hand 

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:45.710
 here 

00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:55.949
 and so triangles are formed 

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:05.729
 we beat an egg and with this egg 

00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:09.229
 we use 

00:05:05.729 --> 00:05:09.229
 our triangles 

00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:18.810
 and it's optional we can sprinkle with 

00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:22.370
 Sesame seeds 

00:05:18.810 --> 00:05:22.370
 if you like sesame seeds 

00:05:24.390 --> 00:05:30.560
 and we also take them to the oven to 180 

00:05:26.790 --> 00:05:30.560
 degrees until brown 

00:05:34.630 --> 00:05:40.030
 this is the final result I hope that 

00:05:37.870 --> 00:05:40.950
 they liked this recipe and see you in 

00:05:40.030 --> 00:05:43.950
 the next video 

00:05:40.950 --> 00:05:43.950
 bye
