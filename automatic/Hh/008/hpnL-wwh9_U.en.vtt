00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:36.540 
with synthetic fibers here is to put

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:38.389 
with synthetic fibers here is to put
hairspray<00:00:36.750> in<00:00:37.140> it<00:00:37.290> don't<00:00:37.980> put<00:00:38.129> anything

00:00:38.389 --> 00:00:38.399 
hairspray in it don't put anything

hairspray in it don't put anything
unnecessary<00:00:39.390> in<00:00:40.110> your<00:00:40.320> hair<00:00:40.440> gel<00:00:40.649> to<00:00:40.800> gel<00:00:40.829> in

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:41.190 
unnecessary in your hair gel to gel in

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:44.270 
unnecessary in your hair gel to gel in
it<00:00:41.340> it<00:00:42.000> is<00:00:42.270> synthetic<00:00:42.770> so<00:00:43.770> it's<00:00:43.920> not<00:00:44.040> going<00:00:44.219> to

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 
it it is synthetic so it's not going to

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:46.760 
it it is synthetic so it's not going to
act<00:00:44.430> like<00:00:44.550> human<00:00:45.329> hair<00:00:45.480> when<00:00:45.840> you<00:00:45.930> put<00:00:46.110> gel<00:00:46.440> or

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:46.770 
act like human hair when you put gel or

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:50.540 
act like human hair when you put gel or
hairspray<00:00:47.039> in<00:00:47.550> it<00:00:47.700> I<00:00:47.989> find<00:00:48.989> that<00:00:49.309> the<00:00:50.309> first

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
hairspray in it I find that the first

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:52.760 
hairspray in it I find that the first
time<00:00:50.730> I<00:00:50.760> had<00:00:51.059> a<00:00:51.090> synthetic<00:00:51.870> weave<00:00:52.140> in<00:00:52.320> my<00:00:52.440> hair

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770 
time I had a synthetic weave in my hair

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:54.500 
time I had a synthetic weave in my hair
I<00:00:52.890> made<00:00:53.370> the<00:00:53.489> mistake<00:00:53.850> of<00:00:54.000> putting<00:00:54.059> hairspray

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
I made the mistake of putting hairspray

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:57.380 
I made the mistake of putting hairspray
in<00:00:54.960> it<00:00:55.050> and<00:00:55.289> it<00:00:55.890> started<00:00:56.250> to<00:00:56.309> catch<00:00:56.610> in<00:00:57.090> the

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
in it and it started to catch in the

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:00.319 
in it and it started to catch in the
back<00:00:57.570> and<00:00:57.840> this<00:00:57.989> was<00:00:58.230> with<00:00:58.469> a<00:00:58.680> good<00:00:59.000> good<00:01:00.000> blend

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
it is not virgin hair the upkeep with

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:18.320 
it is not virgin hair the upkeep with
this<00:01:15.270> is<00:01:15.930> it<00:01:16.890> it's<00:01:17.580> a<00:01:17.820> little<00:01:18.060> bit<00:01:18.150> more

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
this is it it's a little bit more

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:20.090 
this is it it's a little bit more
challenging<00:01:18.900> than<00:01:19.080> we<00:01:19.229> would<00:01:19.500> with<00:01:19.650> human

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.100 
challenging than we would with human

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:22.730 
challenging than we would with human
hair<00:01:20.310> or<00:01:20.549> a<00:01:20.970> virgin<00:01:21.509> are<00:01:21.659> running<00:01:22.049> hairs<00:01:22.259> why

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
hair or a virgin are running hairs why

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:27.109 
hair or a virgin are running hairs why
because<00:01:23.310> it<00:01:23.520> is<00:01:23.670> cheaper<00:01:24.210> hair<00:01:25.130> the<00:01:26.130> 16<00:01:26.580> inches

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:27.119 
because it is cheaper hair the 16 inches

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:32.649 
because it is cheaper hair the 16 inches
was<00:01:28.159> $17.99<00:01:29.189> the<00:01:29.939> 18<00:01:30.450> inches<00:01:30.960> was<00:01:31.590> I<00:01:32.070> believe

00:01:32.649 --> 00:01:32.659 
was $17.99 the 18 inches was I believe

00:01:32.659 --> 00:01:36.590 
was $17.99 the 18 inches was I believe
$21.99<00:01:33.659> and<00:01:34.340> when<00:01:35.340> you're<00:01:35.520> at<00:01:35.670> a<00:01:35.880> synthetic

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
$21.99 and when you're at a synthetic

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:39.219 
$21.99 and when you're at a synthetic
fiber<00:01:36.780> it<00:01:37.049> starts<00:01:37.710> to<00:01:37.920> lose<00:01:38.100> Western<00:01:38.790> I

00:01:39.219 --> 00:01:39.229 
fiber it starts to lose Western I

00:01:39.229 --> 00:01:42.050 
fiber it starts to lose Western I
suggest<00:01:40.229> that<00:01:40.320> you<00:01:40.470> put<00:01:40.710> a<00:01:40.979> lemony<00:01:41.400> spray<00:01:41.820> in

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.060 
suggest that you put a lemony spray in

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:46.580 
suggest that you put a lemony spray in
it<00:01:42.210> I<00:01:43.520> don't<00:01:44.520> know<00:01:44.729> how<00:01:44.850> to<00:01:44.909> say<00:01:45.149> the<00:01:45.299> name<00:01:45.590> it
