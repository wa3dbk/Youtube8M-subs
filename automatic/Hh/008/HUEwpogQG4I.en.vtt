design so what I want you to do is go on

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:41.100 
design so what I want you to do is go on
each<00:01:39.110> of<00:01:39.259> these<00:01:39.380> sides<00:01:39.649> and<00:01:40.070> go

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:41.110 
each of these sides and go

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:44.380 
each of these sides and go
let<00:01:42.110> me<00:01:42.200> count<00:01:42.380> one<00:01:42.649> two<00:01:42.890> three<00:01:43.039> four<00:01:43.759> five<00:01:44.060> six

guys to do now what we're going to start

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:45.100 
guys to do now what we're going to start
it<00:02:42.980> on<00:02:43.040> all<00:02:43.280> the<00:02:43.430> spawn<00:02:43.700> pads<00:02:44.000> themselves<00:02:44.239> so

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:45.110 
it on all the spawn pads themselves so

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:46.570 
it on all the spawn pads themselves so
what<00:02:45.260> I<00:02:45.319> want<00:02:45.470> you<00:02:45.620> to<00:02:45.709> do<00:02:45.830> is<00:02:45.950> expand<00:02:46.400> this

00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:46.580 
what I want you to do is expand this

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:53.949 
what I want you to do is expand this
whole<00:02:46.760> entire<00:02:47.030> thing<00:02:47.120> one<00:02:47.720> block<00:02:48.020> higher<00:02:52.959> let

00:02:53.949 --> 00:02:53.959 
whole entire thing one block higher let

00:02:53.959 --> 00:03:05.250 
whole entire thing one block higher let
me<00:02:54.050> make<00:02:54.200> ya<00:02:54.440> one<00:02:54.680> block<00:02:54.890> higher

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:05.260 

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:09.149 

[Music]

00:03:09.149 --> 00:03:09.159 
[Music]

00:03:09.159 --> 00:03:16.180 
[Music]
almost<00:03:10.159> there

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:16.190 

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:20.110 

BAM<00:03:17.620> so<00:03:18.620> this<00:03:18.920> will<00:03:19.099> allow<00:03:19.190> that<00:03:19.340> mops<00:03:19.700> do<00:03:20.000> is

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:20.120 
BAM so this will allow that mops do is

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:21.520 
BAM so this will allow that mops do is
to<00:03:20.269> fall<00:03:20.450> in<00:03:20.660> and<00:03:20.840> then<00:03:20.959> they<00:03:21.080> can't<00:03:21.290> get<00:03:21.410> out

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:21.530 
to fall in and then they can't get out

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:22.690 
to fall in and then they can't get out
because<00:03:21.709> there's<00:03:22.010> one<00:03:22.190> more<00:03:22.310> black<00:03:22.519> eye<00:03:22.670> or

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:22.700 
because there's one more black eye or

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:24.699 
because there's one more black eye or
they<00:03:22.940> could<00:03:23.060> fall<00:03:23.299> in<00:03:23.510> and<00:03:23.840> then<00:03:24.349> just<00:03:24.379> you

00:03:24.699 --> 00:03:24.709 
they could fall in and then just you

00:03:24.709 --> 00:03:27.069 
they could fall in and then just you
know<00:03:24.860> get<00:03:25.099> back<00:03:25.129> up<00:03:25.510> right<00:03:26.510> now<00:03:26.690> we<00:03:26.750> want<00:03:27.019> to

00:03:27.069 --> 00:03:27.079 
know get back up right now we want to

00:03:27.079 --> 00:03:29.050 
know get back up right now we want to
start<00:03:27.290> on<00:03:27.409> the<00:03:27.500> mob<00:03:27.680> spawning<00:03:28.280> pads<00:03:28.579> himself

00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:29.060 
start on the mob spawning pads himself

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:31.630 
start on the mob spawning pads himself
so<00:03:29.360> you<00:03:30.290> want<00:03:30.440> to<00:03:30.500> take<00:03:30.680> this<00:03:30.860> and<00:03:31.160> you<00:03:31.340> want<00:03:31.549> to

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:31.640 
so you want to take this and you want to

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:34.080 
so you want to take this and you want to
go<00:03:32.599> all<00:03:32.810> the<00:03:32.840> way<00:03:32.959> around<00:03:33.140> with<00:03:33.470> the<00:03:33.560> boundary

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:34.090 
go all the way around with the boundary

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:42.910 
go all the way around with the boundary
like<00:03:35.090> this<00:03:35.440> on<00:03:36.440> each<00:03:36.739> side<00:03:38.440> as<00:03:39.440> so<00:03:41.349> and<00:03:42.349> this

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:42.920 
like this on each side as so and this

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:44.589 
like this on each side as so and this
will<00:03:43.069> basically<00:03:43.160> bare<00:03:43.640> outline<00:03:44.090> boundaries

00:03:44.589 --> 00:03:44.599 
will basically bare outline boundaries

00:03:44.599 --> 00:03:46.509 
will basically bare outline boundaries
but<00:03:44.810> we<00:03:44.900> will<00:03:45.049> need<00:03:45.260> to<00:03:45.410> build<00:03:45.680> a<00:03:45.859> wall<00:03:46.129> on<00:03:46.160> this

00:03:46.509 --> 00:03:46.519

00:06:21.880 --> 00:06:21.890 
here and go about three blocks down I

00:06:21.890 --> 00:06:23.440 
here and go about three blocks down I
mean<00:06:22.160> you<00:06:22.370> can<00:06:22.550> do<00:06:22.760> it<00:06:22.790> all<00:06:23.000> the<00:06:23.120> way<00:06:23.210> down<00:06:23.360> if

00:06:23.440 --> 00:06:23.450 
mean you can do it all the way down if

00:06:23.450 --> 00:06:24.820 
mean you can do it all the way down if
you<00:06:23.540> want<00:06:23.780> to<00:06:23.810> but<00:06:24.020> I<00:06:24.080> prefer<00:06:24.380> only<00:06:24.590> three

you want to but I prefer only three

00:06:24.830 --> 00:06:26.350 
you want to but I prefer only three
blocks<00:06:25.040> so<00:06:25.310> spiders<00:06:25.760> don't<00:06:25.970> get<00:06:26.120> stuck

00:06:26.350 --> 00:06:26.360 
blocks so spiders don't get stuck

00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:28.240 
blocks so spiders don't get stuck
because<00:06:26.840> sometimes<00:06:27.350> spiders<00:06:27.710> look<00:06:27.830> at<00:06:27.980> stuck

00:06:28.240 --> 00:06:28.250 
because sometimes spiders look at stuck

00:06:28.250 --> 00:06:30.310 
because sometimes spiders look at stuck
if<00:06:28.400> you<00:06:28.490> do<00:06:28.610> it<00:06:28.700> all<00:06:28.790> the<00:06:28.820> way<00:06:28.970> down<00:06:29.050> so<00:06:30.050> as<00:06:30.170> you
