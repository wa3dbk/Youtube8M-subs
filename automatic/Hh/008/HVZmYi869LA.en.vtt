rather<00:00:25.650> quite<00:00:25.949> nice<00:00:27.439> so<00:00:28.439> the<00:00:28.740> first<00:00:28.949> thing<00:00:29.070> to

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:29.099 
rather quite nice so the first thing to

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:42.479 
case but I'm saying well that it does

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:43.940 
case but I'm saying well that it does
still<00:01:42.689> work<00:01:42.869> as<00:01:43.110> and<00:01:43.259> broken<00:01:43.590> it<00:01:43.680> or<00:01:43.799> anything

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950 
still work as and broken it or anything

still work as and broken it or anything
like<00:01:44.040> that<00:01:44.600> next<00:01:45.600> bit<00:01:45.810> is<00:01:45.840> just<00:01:46.140> your<00:01:46.229> top<00:01:46.380> bit

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590 
like that next bit is just your top bit

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:49.760 
like that next bit is just your top bit

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770 
and that just slides really easily and

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:51.950

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780 
thing to notice quickly in the screen is

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:56.359 
thing to notice quickly in the screen is
of<00:01:55.049> course<00:01:55.259> it<00:01:55.530> does<00:01:55.770> look<00:01:55.950> a<00:01:55.979> little<00:01:56.159> bit

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:56.369 
of course it does look a little bit

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:57.770 
of course it does look a little bit
bigger<00:01:56.490> you<00:01:56.700> get<00:01:56.820> this<00:01:56.939> extra<00:01:57.270> sort<00:01:57.509> of<00:01:57.540> bezel

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:57.780 
bigger you get this extra sort of bezel

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:01.819 
bigger you get this extra sort of bezel
at<00:01:58.079> the<00:01:58.200> bottom<00:01:58.759> now<00:01:59.759> these<00:01:59.909> two<00:02:00.119> grills<00:02:00.829> turn

00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:01.829 
at the bottom now these two grills turn

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:03.590 
at the bottom now these two grills turn
the<00:02:01.979> speaker<00:02:02.369> into<00:02:02.640> a<00:02:02.700> front<00:02:02.939> facing<00:02:03.240> speaker

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:03.600 
the speaker into a front facing speaker

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:05.209 
the speaker into a front facing speaker
obviously<00:02:03.719> pretty<00:02:04.439> much<00:02:04.680> only<00:02:04.950> going<00:02:05.070> to<00:02:05.130> come

00:02:05.209 --> 00:02:05.219 
obviously pretty much only going to come

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:06.469 
obviously pretty much only going to come
out<00:02:05.310> of<00:02:05.369> there<00:02:05.640> because<00:02:05.790> that's<00:02:06.030> the<00:02:06.240> only<00:02:06.299> one

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:06.479 
out of there because that's the only one

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:08.990 
out of there because that's the only one
actually<00:02:06.750> as<00:02:07.020> a<00:02:07.079> speaker<00:02:07.320> on<00:02:07.439> the<00:02:07.500> Nexus<00:02:07.829> 5<00:02:08.000> but

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:09.000 
actually as a speaker on the Nexus 5 but

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:10.100 
actually as a speaker on the Nexus 5 but
that<00:02:09.030> works<00:02:09.270> really<00:02:09.479> well<00:02:09.569> having<00:02:09.929> had<00:02:10.020> any

cutout which stops any issues with
camera<00:02:45.250> flash<00:02:45.489> and<00:02:46.390> again<00:02:46.989> I<00:02:47.019> have<00:02:47.230> had<00:02:47.380> any

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:47.620 
camera flash and again I have had any

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:49.140 
camera flash and again I have had any
issues<00:02:47.860> at<00:02:47.980> all<00:02:48.160> with<00:02:48.220> a<00:02:48.400> camera<00:02:48.730> while<00:02:48.880> using

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:49.150 
issues at all with a camera while using

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:50.400 
issues at all with a camera while using
this<00:02:49.209> case<00:02:49.480> so<00:02:49.780> obviously<00:02:50.050> this<00:02:50.110> makes<00:02:50.260> the

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:50.410 
this case so obviously this makes the

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:52.770 
this case so obviously this makes the
phone<00:02:50.620> quite<00:02:51.010> a<00:02:51.040> lot<00:02:51.280> thicker<00:02:51.549> this<00:02:51.819> way<00:02:52.000> you

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:52.780 
phone quite a lot thicker this way you

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:54.090 
phone quite a lot thicker this way you
see<00:02:52.959> where<00:02:53.110> that<00:02:53.260> lip<00:02:53.530> is<00:02:53.680> there<00:02:53.890> that's

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:54.100 
see where that lip is there that's

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:56.759 
see where that lip is there that's
roughly<00:02:54.670> where<00:02:54.819> the<00:02:54.940> Nexus<00:02:55.269> 5<00:02:55.480> is<00:02:55.510> normally<00:02:56.380> so

00:02:56.759 --> 00:02:56.769 
roughly where the Nexus 5 is normally so

00:02:56.769 --> 00:02:58.320 
roughly where the Nexus 5 is normally so
you've<00:02:56.890> got<00:02:57.010> all<00:02:57.190> extra<00:02:57.610> added<00:02:57.850> bulk<00:02:58.030> it<00:02:58.269> is

00:02:58.320 --> 00:02:58.330 
you've got all extra added bulk it is

00:02:58.330 --> 00:02:59.910 
you've got all extra added bulk it is
beveled<00:02:58.810> quite<00:02:59.019> nicely<00:02:59.230> so<00:02:59.440> it<00:02:59.620> doesn't<00:02:59.799> feel

00:02:59.910 --> 00:02:59.920

too<00:02:59.980> bad<00:03:00.340> in<00:03:00.459> the<00:03:00.519> hand<00:03:00.730> it<00:03:00.940> feels<00:03:01.450> kind<00:03:01.690> of

00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:01.720 
too bad in the hand it feels kind of

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:03.690 
too bad in the hand it feels kind of
like<00:03:01.870> an<00:03:01.989> old<00:03:02.140> HTC<00:03:02.590> device<00:03:02.920> from<00:03:03.160> like<00:03:03.340> three

years ago something with a keyboard does
sort<00:03:05.350> of<00:03:05.410> feel<00:03:05.620> so<00:03:06.250> to<00:03:06.310> be<00:03:06.640> honest<00:03:06.880> it's<00:03:07.030> not<00:03:07.180> a

00:03:07.199 --> 00:03:07.209 
sort of feel so to be honest it's not a

00:03:07.209 --> 00:03:09.090 
sort of feel so to be honest it's not a
massive<00:03:07.840> problem<00:03:08.380> it's<00:03:08.500> a<00:03:08.560> lot<00:03:08.709> better<00:03:08.830> than<00:03:09.040> a

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:09.100 
massive problem it's a lot better than a

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:10.800 
massive problem it's a lot better than a
lot<00:03:09.280> of<00:03:09.370> them<00:03:09.610> batch<00:03:09.850> cases<00:03:10.299> I've<00:03:10.420> used<00:03:10.630> where

lot of them batch cases I've used where

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:12.330 
lot of them batch cases I've used where
the<00:03:10.930> battery<00:03:11.290> sort<00:03:11.500> of<00:03:11.560> extends<00:03:12.010> a<00:03:12.069> huge

the battery sort of extends a huge
amount<00:03:12.670> but<00:03:12.850> only<00:03:12.970> in<00:03:13.090> one<00:03:13.269> place<00:03:13.480> and<00:03:13.810> it's

amount but only in one place and it's

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:15.900 
amount but only in one place and it's
all<00:03:13.989> weird<00:03:14.350> and<00:03:14.590> this<00:03:15.160> just<00:03:15.430> feels<00:03:15.580> really

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:15.910 
all weird and this just feels really

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:17.309 
all weird and this just feels really
nice<00:03:16.120> in<00:03:16.269> the<00:03:16.360> hand<00:03:16.390> compared<00:03:16.959> to<00:03:17.049> a<00:03:17.110> lot<00:03:17.230> of

00:03:17.309 --> 00:03:17.319 
nice in the hand compared to a lot of

00:03:17.319 --> 00:03:19.530 
nice in the hand compared to a lot of
other<00:03:17.410> cases<00:03:17.650> but<00:03:18.370> saying<00:03:18.730> that<00:03:18.940> if<00:03:19.120> you<00:03:19.269> love

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:19.540 
other cases but saying that if you love

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:21.300 
other cases but saying that if you love
the<00:03:19.600> naked<00:03:20.170> nexus<00:03:20.500> feel<00:03:20.709> you<00:03:20.950> are<00:03:21.100> going<00:03:21.250> to

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:21.310 
the naked nexus feel you are going to

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:23.250 
the naked nexus feel you are going to
get<00:03:21.370> really<00:03:21.700> irritated<00:03:21.820> using<00:03:22.420> this<00:03:22.510> you<00:03:23.140> have

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:23.260 
get really irritated using this you have

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:24.990 
get really irritated using this you have
got<00:03:23.440> an<00:03:23.530> ever<00:03:23.680> so<00:03:23.890> slight<00:03:23.920> lip<00:03:24.459> on<00:03:24.640> the<00:03:24.730> front

00:03:24.990 --> 00:03:25.000 
got an ever so slight lip on the front

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:26.430 
got an ever so slight lip on the front
so<00:03:25.239> if<00:03:25.329> you<00:03:25.420> drop<00:03:25.600> down<00:03:25.810> there<00:03:26.019> you've<00:03:26.230> got

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:26.440 
so if you drop down there you've got

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:28.110 
so if you drop down there you've got
some<00:03:26.709> sort<00:03:26.859> of<00:03:26.950> lay<00:03:27.130> on<00:03:27.220> the<00:03:27.310> table<00:03:27.459> design<00:03:27.640> so

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:28.120 
some sort of lay on the table design so

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:30.060 
some sort of lay on the table design so
you<00:03:28.209> are<00:03:28.329> going<00:03:28.420> to<00:03:28.510> scratch<00:03:28.720> the<00:03:28.840> screen<00:03:29.070> but

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:30.070 
you are going to scratch the screen but

00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:31.530 
you are going to scratch the screen but
saying<00:03:30.220> that<00:03:30.400> is<00:03:30.549> fairly<00:03:30.850> minimal<00:03:31.060> and<00:03:31.450> I

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:31.540 
saying that is fairly minimal and I

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:32.520 
saying that is fairly minimal and I
don't<00:03:31.600> think<00:03:31.810> it's<00:03:32.019> designed<00:03:32.320> to<00:03:32.440> actually

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:32.530 
don't think it's designed to actually

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:34.319 
don't think it's designed to actually
give<00:03:32.739> a<00:03:32.799> huge<00:03:33.010> amount<00:03:33.190> protection<00:03:33.640> and<00:03:34.000> when

00:03:34.319 --> 00:03:34.329 
give a huge amount protection and when

00:03:34.329 --> 00:03:36.360 
give a huge amount protection and when
placed<00:03:34.630> facedown<00:03:34.870> if<00:03:35.380> you<00:03:35.769> drop<00:03:36.040> your<00:03:36.070> phone

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:36.370 
placed facedown if you drop your phone

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:38.250 
placed facedown if you drop your phone
when<00:03:36.579> using<00:03:36.760> this<00:03:37.030> I've<00:03:37.690> dropped<00:03:37.870> it<00:03:37.989> a<00:03:38.079> couple

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:38.260 
when using this I've dropped it a couple

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:41.069 
when using this I've dropped it a couple
of<00:03:38.350> times<00:03:38.650> and<00:03:39.120> it<00:03:40.120> does<00:03:40.299> seem<00:03:40.600> to<00:03:40.630> give<00:03:40.870> pretty

00:03:41.069 --> 00:03:41.079 
of times and it does seem to give pretty

00:03:41.079 --> 00:03:42.810 
of times and it does seem to give pretty
good<00:03:41.170> protection<00:03:41.410> it's<00:03:42.160> not<00:03:42.340> quite<00:03:42.579> going<00:03:42.730> to

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:42.820 
good protection it's not quite going to

00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:44.340 
good protection it's not quite going to
get<00:03:42.940> to<00:03:43.060> the<00:03:43.150> same<00:03:43.329> level<00:03:43.600> as<00:03:43.690> say<00:03:43.840> an<00:03:43.900> otterbox

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:44.350 
get to the same level as say an otterbox

00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:45.420 
get to the same level as say an otterbox
or<00:03:44.560> something<00:03:44.799> like<00:03:44.859> that<00:03:44.920> but<00:03:45.310> i<00:03:45.340> think

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:45.430 
or something like that but i think

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:47.789 
or something like that but i think
considering<00:03:46.420> this<00:03:46.630> case<00:03:46.840> is<00:03:46.989> fifty<00:03:47.350> quid<00:03:47.560> if

00:03:47.789 --> 00:03:47.799 
considering this case is fifty quid if

00:03:47.799 --> 00:03:49.440 
considering this case is fifty quid if
you're<00:03:47.920> in<00:03:48.010> the<00:03:48.100> UK<00:03:48.250> from<00:03:48.640> amazon<00:03:49.030> you're

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:49.450 
you're in the UK from amazon you're

00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:50.819 
you're in the UK from amazon you're
shelling<00:03:49.690> out<00:03:49.840> a<00:03:49.870> lot<00:03:50.140> on<00:03:50.170> the<00:03:50.350> case<00:03:50.560> and<00:03:50.769> you

00:03:50.819 --> 00:03:50.829 
shelling out a lot on the case and you

00:03:50.829 --> 00:03:52.319 
shelling out a lot on the case and you
expect<00:03:51.190> it<00:03:51.250> to<00:03:51.310> do<00:03:51.489> more<00:03:51.700> than<00:03:51.850> just<00:03:51.910> charge

00:03:52.319 --> 00:03:52.329 
expect it to do more than just charge

00:03:52.329 --> 00:03:53.550 
expect it to do more than just charge
your<00:03:52.480> phone<00:03:52.660> I<00:03:52.840> think<00:03:53.079> this<00:03:53.230> will<00:03:53.350> protect

00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:53.560 
your phone I think this will protect

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:56.099 
your phone I think this will protect
your<00:03:53.739> phone<00:03:53.980> pretty<00:03:54.760> well<00:03:55.000> from<00:03:55.239> any<00:03:55.780> drops

00:03:56.099 --> 00:03:56.109 
your phone pretty well from any drops

00:03:56.109 --> 00:03:57.630 
your phone pretty well from any drops

00:05:45.210 --> 00:05:45.220 
myself using this just because it is

00:05:45.220 --> 00:05:46.650 
myself using this just because it is
nice<00:05:45.400> to<00:05:45.430> have<00:05:45.640> something<00:05:45.940> on<00:05:46.030> the<00:05:46.180> phone<00:05:46.450> and
