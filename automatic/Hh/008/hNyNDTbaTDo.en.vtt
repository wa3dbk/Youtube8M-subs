consumption<00:00:28.769> looking<00:00:29.519> oh<00:00:29.609> so<00:00:29.640> much<00:00:30.710> so<00:00:31.710> we're

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:31.859 
consumption looking oh so much so we're

looking<00:00:32.070> at<00:00:32.160> this<00:00:32.570> baffle<00:00:33.570> problem<00:00:34.050> somehow

00:00:34.330 --> 00:00:34.340 
looking at this baffle problem somehow

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:37.639 
looking at this baffle problem somehow
the<00:00:35.340> issue<00:00:35.550> look<00:00:36.180> on<00:00:36.510> the<00:00:36.809> motors<00:00:37.200> with<00:00:37.469> the

00:00:37.639 --> 00:00:37.649 
the issue look on the motors with the

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:42.369 
the issue look on the motors with the
multi<00:00:38.250> cylinder<00:00:38.579> displacement<00:00:39.950> the

00:00:42.369 --> 00:00:42.379 
multi cylinder displacement the

00:00:42.379 --> 00:00:45.670 
multi cylinder displacement the
discharge<00:00:43.379> for<00:00:43.649> the<00:00:43.739> oil<00:00:43.950> for<00:00:44.399> lifters<00:00:45.239> is

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:45.680 
discharge for the oil for lifters is

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:47.720 
discharge for the oil for lifters is
right<00:00:46.680> about<00:00:46.890> in<00:00:46.980> this<00:00:47.070> area<00:00:47.219> in<00:00:47.399> the<00:00:47.489> solder

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.730 
right about in this area in the solder

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:50.590 
right about in this area in the solder
head<00:00:47.879> and<00:00:48.090> then<00:00:48.660> the<00:00:48.750> PCB<00:00:49.200> sucks<00:00:49.559> it<00:00:49.739> up<00:00:49.860> and

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:50.600 
head and then the PCB sucks it up and

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:52.549 
head and then the PCB sucks it up and
burns<00:00:51.600> it

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559 
burns it

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:55.549 
burns it
despite<00:00:53.190> is<00:00:53.340> located<00:00:54.149> locating<00:00:54.600> it<00:00:54.719> look<00:00:55.440> at

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559 
despite is located locating it look at

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:59.479 
despite is located locating it look at
that<00:00:56.300> fixes<00:00:57.300> New<00:00:57.480> York<00:00:58.100> so<00:00:59.100> if<00:00:59.160> you<00:00:59.250> want<00:00:59.370> to<00:00:59.430> be

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
that fixes New York so if you want to be

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:01.189 
that fixes New York so if you want to be
super<00:00:59.730> cheap<00:00:59.940> you<00:01:00.090> could<00:01:00.180> jb<00:01:00.449> weld<00:01:00.719> that<00:01:00.989> right

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199 
super cheap you could jb weld that right

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:03.349 
super cheap you could jb weld that right
there<00:01:01.469> and<00:01:02.190> then<00:01:02.489> I<00:01:02.520> drill<00:01:02.850> a<00:01:02.969> hole<00:01:03.090> somewhere

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359 
there and then I drill a hole somewhere

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:19.360 
there and then I drill a hole somewhere
else<00:01:03.629> now<00:01:04.170> you<00:01:04.199> might<00:01:04.470> be<00:01:04.500> able<00:01:04.650> to

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:19.370 

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:22.970 

where's<00:01:20.370> it<00:01:20.670> oh<00:01:21.290> I<00:01:22.290> think<00:01:22.350> it's<00:01:22.650> because<00:01:22.890> it

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:22.980 
where's it oh I think it's because it

00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:26.260 
where's it oh I think it's because it
actually<00:01:23.100> then<00:01:23.880> discharges<00:01:24.450> the<00:01:24.920> pushrod<00:01:25.920> oh

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:26.270 
actually then discharges the pushrod oh

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:31.940 
actually then discharges the pushrod oh
that<00:01:27.270> would<00:01:27.360> make<00:01:27.480> sense<00:01:27.660> yeah<00:01:29.420> yeah<00:01:30.950> very

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
that would make sense yeah yeah very

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:36.890 
that would make sense yeah yeah very
nice<00:01:34.520> and<00:01:35.520> you<00:01:35.730> can<00:01:35.850> just<00:01:36.000> leave<00:01:36.180> the<00:01:36.360> coils

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:36.900 
nice and you can just leave the coils

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:39.530 
nice and you can just leave the coils
and<00:01:37.200> the<00:01:37.650> spark<00:01:38.010> plug<00:01:38.250> wires<00:01:38.640> connected<00:01:39.330> just

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:39.540 
and the spark plug wires connected just

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:42.590 
and the spark plug wires connected just
disconnect<00:01:40.230> the<00:01:40.350> one<00:01:41.030> electrical<00:01:42.030> connector

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600 
disconnect the one electrical connector

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:44.360 
disconnect the one electrical connector
up<00:01:42.990> here<00:01:43.380> there's<00:01:43.590> electrical<00:01:44.010> connector

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:44.370 
up here there's electrical connector

00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:47.030 
up here there's electrical connector
that<00:01:44.520> connects<00:01:44.790> all<00:01:45.000> the<00:01:45.510> coils<00:01:45.770> together<00:01:46.770> so

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.040 
that connects all the coils together so

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:48.890 
that connects all the coils together so
just<00:01:47.070> disconnect<00:01:47.880> that<00:01:47.940> and<00:01:48.300> take<00:01:48.450> off<00:01:48.630> your

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:48.900 
just disconnect that and take off your

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:51.140 
just disconnect that and take off your
maybe<00:01:49.220> four<00:01:50.220> or<00:01:50.250> five<00:01:50.369> bolts

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:51.150 
maybe four or five bolts

00:01:51.150 --> 00:02:23.780 
maybe four or five bolts
how<00:01:51.450> many<00:01:51.570> holds<00:01:51.810> that<00:01:51.900> in<00:01:52.080> place<00:01:52.369> for<00:01:53.369> four

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:23.790 

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:26.250 

this<00:02:24.790> is<00:02:24.970> the<00:02:25.180> left<00:02:25.540> valve<00:02:25.840> cover

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:26.260 
this is the left valve cover

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:38.500 
this is the left valve cover
darvocet<00:02:28.890> right<00:02:29.890> now<00:02:30.099> is<00:02:30.459> fine

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:38.510 

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:43.929 

by<00:02:39.909> ten<00:02:40.909> millimeter<00:02:41.299> bolts<00:02:41.569> looks<00:02:41.840> like<00:02:42.939> for

00:02:43.929 --> 00:02:43.939 
by ten millimeter bolts looks like for

00:02:43.939 --> 00:02:53.319 
by ten millimeter bolts looks like for
the<00:02:44.349> quail<00:02:45.349> bracket<00:02:46.040> assembly<00:02:49.510> I<00:02:52.269> have<00:02:53.269> to

00:02:53.319 --> 00:02:53.329 
the quail bracket assembly I have to

00:02:53.329 --> 00:02:55.240 
the quail bracket assembly I have to
start<00:02:53.569> dimensionally<00:02:54.049> that<00:02:54.319> light<00:02:54.620> shining

00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:55.250 
start dimensionally that light shining

00:02:55.250 --> 00:03:00.460 
start dimensionally that light shining
down<00:02:55.280> there<00:02:55.610> feel<00:02:55.790> great<00:02:58.900> yeah<00:02:59.930> no<00:03:00.079> iPhones

00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:00.470 
down there feel great yeah no iPhones

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:01.780 
down there feel great yeah no iPhones
