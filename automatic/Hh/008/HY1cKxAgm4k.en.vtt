going to be doing today is this fully

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:17.270 
going to be doing today is this fully
automatic<00:00:14.730> sugarcane<00:00:15.269> farm<00:00:15.570> so<00:00:16.500> as<00:00:16.800> you<00:00:17.130> can

00:00:17.270 --> 00:00:17.280 
automatic sugarcane farm so as you can

automatic sugarcane farm so as you can
see<00:00:17.600> the<00:00:18.600> sugarcane<00:00:18.960> will<00:00:19.320> grow<00:00:19.680> like<00:00:20.550> so<00:00:21.420> once

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:22.170 
see the sugarcane will grow like so once

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:24.800 
see the sugarcane will grow like so once
the<00:00:22.350> sugar<00:00:22.500> cane<00:00:22.800> grows<00:00:23.100> it<00:00:24.090> pushes<00:00:24.449> it<00:00:24.630> into

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:24.810 
the sugar cane grows it pushes it into

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:26.750 
the sugar cane grows it pushes it into
the<00:00:24.990> water<00:00:25.230> which<00:00:25.590> collect<00:00:26.250> it<00:00:26.430> and<00:00:26.609> the

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:26.760 
the water which collect it and the

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:29.510 
the water which collect it and the
hoppers<00:00:27.150> and<00:00:27.869> it<00:00:28.199> goes<00:00:28.410> in<00:00:28.590> the<00:00:28.619> Chester<00:00:29.160> fully

00:00:29.510 --> 00:00:29.520 
hoppers and it goes in the Chester fully

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:31.099 
hoppers and it goes in the Chester fully
automatic<00:00:30.090> means<00:00:30.390> you'll<00:00:30.810> have<00:00:30.930> to<00:00:31.050> do

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:31.109 
automatic means you'll have to do

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:33.500 
automatic means you'll have to do
anything<00:00:31.470> it'll<00:00:31.890> just<00:00:32.099> run<00:00:32.669> itself<00:00:33.089> so<00:00:33.300> once

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:33.510 
anything it'll just run itself so once

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:36.349 
anything it'll just run itself so once
it<00:00:33.629> grows<00:00:33.809> pushes<00:00:34.469> it<00:00:34.620> hoppers<00:00:35.550> and<00:00:35.909> the

00:00:36.349 --> 00:00:36.359 
it grows pushes it hoppers and the

00:00:36.359 --> 00:00:38.809 
it grows pushes it hoppers and the
chests<00:00:36.749> so<00:00:37.440> over<00:00:37.800> time<00:00:38.010> you'll<00:00:38.370> get<00:00:38.550> a<00:00:38.609> bunch

00:00:38.809 --> 00:00:38.819 
chests so over time you'll get a bunch

00:00:38.819 --> 00:00:42.110 
chests so over time you'll get a bunch
of<00:00:38.999> sugarcane<00:00:40.159> here<00:00:41.159> is<00:00:41.399> a<00:00:41.429> redstone<00:00:41.819> right

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:42.120

your normal Pistons not need sticky

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:51.350 
your normal Pistons not need sticky
pistons<00:01:48.570> for<00:01:48.780> this<00:01:48.930> build<00:01:49.670> and<00:01:50.670> then<00:01:50.850> you<00:01:51.030> just

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:51.360 
pistons for this build and then you just

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:55.040 
pistons for this build and then you just
put<00:01:51.630> two<00:01:51.900> blocks<00:01:52.170> up<00:01:52.470> there<00:01:52.970> and<00:01:53.970> two<00:01:54.810> blocks

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:55.050 
put two blocks up there and two blocks

00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:57.520 
put two blocks up there and two blocks
up<00:01:55.409> there<00:01:55.680> so<00:01:55.920> it<00:01:55.980> should<00:01:56.159> look<00:01:56.190> like<00:01:56.400> this

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:01.290 
then next you can add a roof this is

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:04.310 
then next you can add a roof this is
optional<00:02:01.890> but<00:02:02.000> it<00:02:03.000> looks<00:02:03.360> a<00:02:03.630> lot<00:02:03.930> better

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:04.320 
optional but it looks a lot better

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:07.070 
optional but it looks a lot better
with<00:02:04.680> this<00:02:04.920> roof<00:02:05.390> then<00:02:06.390> you're<00:02:06.570> going<00:02:06.750> to<00:02:06.810> want

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:07.080 
with this roof then you're going to want

00:02:12.789 --> 00:02:12.799 
see this block take that block out add a

00:02:12.799 --> 00:02:14.059 
see this block take that block out add a
piston

00:02:14.059 --> 00:02:14.069 
piston

00:02:14.069 --> 00:02:17.839 
piston
with<00:02:14.249> sand<00:02:14.790> on<00:02:14.939> top<00:02:15.409> the<00:02:16.409> furnace<00:02:16.859> and<00:02:17.040> 23

00:02:17.839 --> 00:02:17.849 
with sand on top the furnace and 23

00:02:17.849 --> 00:02:19.550 
with sand on top the furnace and 23
items<00:02:17.999> on<00:02:18.299> the<00:02:18.359> top<00:02:18.540> it<00:02:18.719> could<00:02:18.810> be<00:02:18.900> any<00:02:19.079> items

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:19.560 
items on the top it could be any items

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:21.800 
items on the top it could be any items
so<00:02:20.519> then<00:02:20.730> you're<00:02:21.120> going<00:02:21.269> to<00:02:21.359> want<00:02:21.569> to<00:02:21.629> come

your redstone all the way through just
like<00:02:52.199> this<00:02:52.530> so<00:02:53.489> now<00:02:53.699> you<00:02:54.480> should<00:02:54.510> be<00:02:54.989> done<00:02:55.169> but

00:02:55.849 --> 00:02:55.859 
like this so now you should be done but

00:02:55.859 --> 00:02:59.059 
like this so now you should be done but
all<00:02:56.040> you<00:02:56.189> have<00:02:56.340> to<00:02:56.459> do<00:02:56.579> is<00:02:57.560> just<00:02:58.560> add<00:02:58.739> these

00:02:59.059 --> 00:02:59.069 
all you have to do is just add these

00:02:59.069 --> 00:03:03.470 
all you have to do is just add these
glass<00:02:59.400> panes<00:02:59.819> or<00:03:00.260> it<00:03:01.260> could<00:03:01.469> be<00:03:01.859> iron<00:03:02.730> bars<00:03:03.000> but

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:03.480 
glass panes or it could be iron bars but

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:07.280 
glass panes or it could be iron bars but
I<00:03:03.510> think<00:03:03.930> glass<00:03:04.319> panes<00:03:04.650> looks<00:03:05.579> better<00:03:06.230> now<00:03:07.230> you

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:07.290 
I think glass panes looks better now you

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:12.819 
I think glass panes looks better now you
could<00:03:07.500> add<00:03:07.739> this<00:03:08.040> part<00:03:08.370> and<00:03:09.319> you<00:03:10.319> are<00:03:10.349> done<00:03:11.239> so

00:03:12.819 --> 00:03:12.829 
could add this part and you are done so

00:03:12.829 --> 00:03:16.640 
could add this part and you are done so
this<00:03:13.909> should<00:03:14.909> automatically<00:03:15.480> grow<00:03:15.750> and<00:03:16.019> it

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:16.650 
this should automatically grow and it

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:19.249 
this should automatically grow and it
should<00:03:16.859> come<00:03:17.129> in<00:03:17.340> your<00:03:17.549> tress<00:03:17.840> so<00:03:18.840> thank<00:03:19.109> you
