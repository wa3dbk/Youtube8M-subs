00:00:02.920 --> 00:00:08.760
 Hello everyone. Here is Lew's new video, which is the third in the new series. 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:16.600
 Called "Is this terrible?" series. Today I am happy to introduce you to a $40 Android tablet. 

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:23.360
 I need to calm down. I mentioned in the "Three Discounted Electronics" video that the tablet is about $35. 

00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:30.360
 The following bunch of comments asked me for further evaluation. So I added it to Amazon's shopping cart and bought it back. 

00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:36.720
 I made this video and told you what the $40 Android tablet is. 

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:45.380
 The outer packaging of the cardboard box is not very luxurious. . . There is a manual inside, 噢

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:53.400
 This can be fun. “Thank you for purchasing iRulu. Please enjoy your new tablet. You have made a wise decision. 

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:56.520
 Use an iRulu product. *laugh* 

00:00:58.180 --> 00:00:58.980
 Ok! 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:08.100
 This is the tablet. The package looks good. The bubble cloth and another set protect the tablet. The one I bought is orange. 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:09.180
 Woohoohoo! 

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:17.280
 It looks very good for my taste. Through quality control, I feel okay, QC1. TF card? 

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:26.000
 What is the TF card? It should be a microSD card. There is some glue here, maybe someone has torn the sticker off. 

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:33.120
 Ok, the charging interface is DC 5V. Micro USB, microphone, rear camera, speaker, 

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:36.760
 The serial number sticker is affixed to the appropriate place, volume control button. 

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:39.720
 The feeling of pressing down is good. 

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:44.160
 Front camera, power button, headphone jack. iRulu 

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:51.460
 Inside the box, there is a charging cable. Not necessarily, but I really hope this is a micro USB interface. Although I don't know 

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:58.700
 Maybe you can charge it with a micro USB. Maybe this is both interfaces. Ok, no more. It cost another 40 dollars. 

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:03.020
 It seems that I can't open the machine now. Is there a protective film on the screen? 

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:10.860
 The picture feels a bit strange. Please use the AC adapter supplied with the charger. Strange charging method. Ok, so 

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:18.960
 Just cut it off, I plugged in the charging cable and picked up a USB charger there. But I don't know now. 

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:26.180
 Does this have a screen protector attached, or I should tear it off. However, there is no label on it. 

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:31.300
 So, we should charge for 10 hours for the first time. "caveat... 

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:39.340
 When you use the device for the first time, fully charge the battery. Charge it for 7 hours later. 

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:44.900
 Otherwise, you will have trouble and the battery life will be reduced." 

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:48.260
 "You don't want to get in trouble" (laugh) 

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:51.660
 You may have trouble! 

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:06.160
 Ok, this tablet has been charged for a while, I think I can go to boot. At least I hope so 

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:12.640
 *Piano music for tablets* 

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:20.740
 Damn... this is very sensational. Wow, I barely saw the contents of the screen. what? God, this picture 

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:24.080
 *laugh* 

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:28.220
 Well, there should be a higher brightness to choose from. Already the highest brightness? 

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:37.200
 The screen is so reflective! You guess it is also not clear, this brightness, I can barely see the icon 

00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:45.480
 do you know? I am dizzy! I feel that I should be able to do better. Well, this reaction is faster than I expected. 

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:53.660
 I want to play the video here. Strange aspect ratio. Full screen does not completely fill the screen 

00:03:53.660 --> 00:04:01.020
 There are black edges on both sides. This is the resolution of 1020 x 600. Wow... I feel that I am now a war slag. 

00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:07.440
 This seems strange, I thought it would be a little better. 

00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:14.800
 Ok, this tablet has a 300,000 pixel front camera. Let's see how it works. Whoohohoo. 

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:19.520
 Comes with diving effects. Let us see 

00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:28.360
 Oh yeah. Now, look at how the rear camera is. Various problems have appeared in the system. 

00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:39.240
 Unexpected. Just watched a very cheap Android phone. This tablet made me feel incredible slag. 

00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:43.840
 You can see the reflection of my finger on the screen. This screen is too bad 

00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:52.880
 Work is like a toy. I don't know why, there are two different places in the tray. 

00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:57.740
 Sound mode. It does not have stereo speakers. This is very strange. I guess 

00:04:57.740 --> 00:05:02.560
 "Ma Fengbo is interested in knowing the price, and people encounter their own voices." 

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:07.240
 "Get started," I should not sign up for an account. I don't understand why you want to buy this stuff. 

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:11.500
 I don't know who needs this broken thing. I expected - I have a nightmare at night because this screen 

00:05:12.540 --> 00:05:13.720
 Is this very bad? 

00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:19.540
 This is very bad, it's very junk, this is too spicy chicken (laugh) 

00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:25.560
 Visual inspection should be like this, there should be no other things to say. Now I am going to prepare the material for the next episode. 

00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:29.900
 Looking forward to the next issue, "Is this very bad?". But this tablet is really spicy chicken, don't touch it. 

00:05:29.900 --> 00:05:32.160
 Is there a micro SD card expansion slot (laugh) [The TF card is marked on the body] 

00:05:33.920 --> 00:05:39.220
 Ok, that's it. This is what I can say about it. Thank you very much for watching. If you like this new 

00:05:39.220 --> 00:05:43.540
 Series "Is this very bad?, please be sure to leave your comment below, see you next time. 

00:05:43.540 --> 00:05:45.240
 Next episode, next time 

00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:47.240
 Whoohoohoo
