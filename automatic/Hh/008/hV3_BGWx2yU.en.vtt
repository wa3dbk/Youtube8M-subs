you need not only movement you know

00:02:43.269 --> 00:02:47.009 
you need not only movement you know
resistance<00:02:43.840> training<00:02:44.110> is<00:02:45.540> object<00:02:46.540> it's<00:02:46.810> not

00:02:47.009 --> 00:02:47.019 
resistance training is object it's not

lifting<00:02:47.860> the<00:02:47.980> weight<00:02:48.180> object<00:02:49.180> is<00:02:50.250> contraction

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:51.250 
lifting the weight object is contraction

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:54.710 
lifting the weight object is contraction
your<00:02:51.549> muscle<00:02:52.000> with<00:02:52.840> weight<00:02:53.290> use<00:02:54.220> your<00:02:54.459> weight

00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:54.720 
your muscle with weight use your weight

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:59.400 
your muscle with weight use your weight
to<00:02:55.720> contract<00:02:56.349> more<00:02:56.920> that<00:02:57.810> reaches<00:02:58.810> training

00:02:59.400 --> 00:02:59.410 
to contract more that reaches training

00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:01.229 
to contract more that reaches training
object<00:03:00.220> okay

00:03:01.229 --> 00:03:01.239 
object okay

00:03:01.239 --> 00:03:03.720 
object okay
not<00:03:01.690> only<00:03:01.870> movement<00:03:02.379> before<00:03:02.799> you<00:03:03.190> need<00:03:03.370> to<00:03:03.430> do

not only movement before you need to do

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:07.860 
not only movement before you need to do
you<00:03:04.269> know<00:03:04.390> drawing<00:03:04.780> see<00:03:05.650> not<00:03:06.250> only<00:03:06.549> moving<00:03:07.360> you

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:07.870 
you know drawing see not only moving you

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:13.380 
you know drawing see not only moving you
need<00:03:08.019> to<00:03:08.110> do<00:03:09.180> contraction<00:03:10.180> and<00:03:10.890> done<00:03:12.180> okay<00:03:13.180> so

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:13.390 
need to do contraction and done okay so
