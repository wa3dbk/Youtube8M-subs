00:04:43.409 --> 00:04:48.300
 air in nature 

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:52.250

00:05:29.389 --> 00:05:34.470
 Sherlock can now play on ipad 

00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:36.900

00:05:40.199 --> 00:05:45.780
 30 minutes to play before we pick up 

00:05:43.620 --> 00:05:50.699

 I moved here more conveniently at the airport 

00:06:07.909 --> 00:06:12.479
 found a new way how to play dota and 

00:06:10.379 --> 00:06:14.669
 that's why you can't play here 

00:06:12.479 --> 00:06:23.879
