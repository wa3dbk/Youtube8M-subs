the idea or the concept is that cameras

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:25.429 
the idea or the concept is that cameras
or<00:00:23.609> sensors<00:00:23.910> within<00:00:24.119> the<00:00:24.330> car<00:00:24.539> can<00:00:25.080> observe

car whispering YouTube actually

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:30.340 
car whispering YouTube actually
break<00:03:28.910> infinite<00:03:29.420> you<00:03:29.510> should<00:03:29.750> actually<00:03:29.960> go

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:30.350 
break infinite you should actually go

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:33.160 
break infinite you should actually go
ahead<00:03:30.410> and<00:03:30.980> turn<00:03:31.610> back<00:03:31.850> so<00:03:32.210> so<00:03:32.840> that's<00:03:33.050> the

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:33.170 
ahead and turn back so so that's the

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:35.050 
ahead and turn back so so that's the
idea<00:03:33.500> so<00:03:34.310> let<00:03:34.430> me<00:03:34.460> here<00:03:34.670> we<00:03:34.760> talk<00:03:34.940> about

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:35.060 
idea so let me here we talk about

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:37.530 
idea so let me here we talk about
convenience<00:03:35.510> aspect<00:03:36.170> of<00:03:36.560> recognizing<00:03:37.310> the

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:37.540 
convenience aspect of recognizing the

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:41.000 
convenience aspect of recognizing the
other<00:03:38.540> side

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:41.010 

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:44.239 

also<00:03:41.790> make<00:03:41.939> sure
