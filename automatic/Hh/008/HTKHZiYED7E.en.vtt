all<00:05:09.270> these<00:05:09.389> things<00:05:10.199> do<00:05:11.160> something<00:05:11.849> I<00:05:12.060> think<00:05:12.960> I

00:05:13.070 --> 00:05:13.080 
all these things do something I think I

00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:16.640 
all these things do something I think I
have<00:05:13.259> a<00:05:13.289> fraction<00:05:13.979> of<00:05:14.069> a<00:05:14.190> life<00:05:14.400> and<00:05:15.259> not<00:05:16.259> even

00:05:16.640 --> 00:05:16.650 
have a fraction of a life and not even

00:05:16.650 --> 00:05:20.360 
have a fraction of a life and not even
quite<00:05:16.979> sure

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:20.370 

00:05:20.370 --> 00:05:23.180 

I<00:05:20.430> suppose<00:05:21.330> that<00:05:21.360> is<00:05:21.570> what<00:05:21.840> is<00:05:22.229> up<00:05:22.440> for<00:05:22.470> us<00:05:22.949> to

00:05:23.180 --> 00:05:23.190 
I suppose that is what is up for us to

00:05:23.190 --> 00:05:27.320 
I suppose that is what is up for us to
find<00:05:23.340> out<00:05:24.860> take<00:05:25.860> that<00:05:26.130> that<00:05:26.550> in<00:05:26.790> which<00:05:27.000> I

00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:27.330 
find out take that that in which I

00:05:27.330 --> 00:05:32.830 
find out take that that in which I
cannot<00:05:27.900> see<00:05:28.229> or<00:05:28.979> speak<00:05:29.430> or<00:05:29.729> hear<00:05:30.979> the<00:05:31.979> evil

00:05:32.830 --> 00:05:32.840 
cannot see or speak or hear the evil

00:05:32.840 --> 00:05:36.280 
cannot see or speak or hear the evil
these<00:05:33.840> things<00:05:34.020> never<00:05:34.229> shot<00:05:34.590> daggers<00:05:35.220> before

00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:36.290 
these things never shot daggers before

00:05:36.290 --> 00:05:39.520 
these things never shot daggers before
I'm<00:05:37.290> not<00:05:37.440> sure<00:05:37.530> what<00:05:37.770> the<00:05:37.860> thing<00:05:38.040> at<00:05:38.130> that

00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:39.530 
I'm not sure what the thing at that

00:05:39.530 --> 00:05:42.500 
I'm not sure what the thing at that
probably<00:05:40.530> not<00:05:40.680> too<00:05:41.040> terribly<00:05:41.669> important<00:05:42.270> to

00:05:42.500 --> 00:05:42.510 
probably not too terribly important to

00:05:42.510 --> 00:05:50.719 
probably not too terribly important to
consider

00:05:50.719 --> 00:05:50.729 

00:05:50.729 --> 00:05:52.790

that<00:06:33.950> so<00:06:35.410> so<00:06:36.410> I'm<00:06:37.190> guessing<00:06:37.490> that<00:06:37.850> if<00:06:37.970> I<00:06:38.120> get

00:06:38.290 --> 00:06:38.300 
that so so I'm guessing that if I get

00:06:38.300 --> 00:06:40.240 
that so so I'm guessing that if I get
you<00:06:38.330> those<00:06:38.660> edges<00:06:39.170> at<00:06:39.410> the<00:06:39.590> screen<00:06:39.920> I<00:06:39.950> will

00:06:40.240 --> 00:06:40.250 
you those edges at the screen I will

00:06:40.250 --> 00:06:43.420 
you those edges at the screen I will
explode<00:06:40.850> and<00:06:41.300> the<00:06:42.020> echoes<00:06:42.440> of<00:06:42.470> my<00:06:42.860> blood<00:06:43.190> will

00:06:43.420 --> 00:06:43.430 
explode and the echoes of my blood will

00:06:43.430 --> 00:06:46.630 
explode and the echoes of my blood will
fly<00:06:43.700> over<00:06:43.730> all<00:06:44.240> the<00:06:44.390> place<00:06:44.920> you<00:06:45.920> used<00:06:45.950> spell

00:06:46.630 --> 00:06:46.640

Japanese

00:06:57.260 --> 00:06:57.270 

00:06:57.270 --> 00:06:59.570 

so<00:06:57.870> I'm<00:06:57.990> just<00:06:58.200> going<00:06:58.410> to<00:06:58.590> assume<00:06:58.710> it's<00:06:59.160> like<00:06:59.370> a

00:06:59.570 --> 00:06:59.580 
so I'm just going to assume it's like a

00:06:59.580 --> 00:07:06.879 
so I'm just going to assume it's like a
cosine<00:07:00.180> equals<00:07:00.420> of<00:07:00.990> the<00:07:01.170> petrol
