00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.020
 hello another day today I bring you a video of 

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:05.940
 good makeup rather of the basics 

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:07.560
 of the make-up and is that it fell on the 

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:09.510
 realize that many times I tell you in 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:11.550
 my videos that I usually outline 

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:12.840
 illuminate the face but until now 

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:15.089
 had made any video where 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:17.039
 taught to do step by step so that 

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:19.500
 Today I'm going to teach you how to do it 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:21.029
 a play of light and shadow to outline 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:23.189
 we give definition to our face 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:24.689
 we can even fine tune our 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:26.789
 factions even make our 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:29.310
 Navid looks smaller in the case of 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:30.720
 that we do not like it like this and when illuminating 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:32.279
 What we do is highlight those 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:34.410
 areas that we want to highlight for example 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:36.719
 the cheekbones, even the lips 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:38.489
 of course not only follow that routine 

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:40.530
 every day the truth is that my day to 

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:42.239
 day only use a routine 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:43.829
 faster makeup because I have only 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:45.420
 be in a hurry I think I have a video 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:46.890
 where he explained my daily routine of 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:49.020
 makeup you use a makeup 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:50.460
 natural and fresh I'll leave it here in 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:52.399
 the information box finally because 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:55.680
 if you want to see everything this routine 

00:00:52.399 --> 00:00:57.090
 outline and mark enough to illuminate me 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:58.890
 I like to do it when I do a makeup 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:01.289
 more elaborate or when I'm going to go out 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:03.480
 there I encourage myself more because I like to do it 

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:06.439
 if you want to see as a contour 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:06.439
 light up my face 

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:16.340
 The first thing we are going to do is apply 

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:17.810
 the foundation of makeup as we have of 

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:19.610
 habit 

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:21.590
 I want to ask for forgiveness, we populate 

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:23.049
 I have a little bit of a cold so 

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:25.100
 I will try to talk as little as possible 

00:01:23.049 --> 00:01:27.229
 today I'm going to apply the makeup base 

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:29.539
 with our skunk brush so that it is 

00:01:27.229 --> 00:01:31.250
 a well-diffused effect for 

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:33.470
 contouring the face we can do it from 

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:36.350
 many different ways for example 

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:39.200
 using this pencil or with the 

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:40.939
 suntan powders that are matt or 

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:42.500
 even also a makeup that is 

00:01:40.939 --> 00:01:44.689
 darker than the tone of our skin 

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:46.820
 regardless of the method you choose 

00:01:44.689 --> 00:01:49.250
 make sure you do not have any glitters 

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:51.470
 mate let's start forming lines in 

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:53.240
 those areas that we want to define by 

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:56.119
 example on the forehead and lower more to the 

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:57.709
 temple and also below the cheekbones if 

00:01:56.119 --> 00:01:59.840
 we do not really know where that is 

00:01:57.709 --> 00:02:01.939
 line we just have to put tea face 

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:04.459
 and in the line that forms below the 

00:02:01.939 --> 00:02:07.330
 Ayers cheekbones and we're going to mark a line 

00:02:04.459 --> 00:02:07.330
 also in the jaw 

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:24.670
 let's also delineate the sides of the 

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:26.920
 nose we start from the eyebrow 

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:28.299
 running around the nasal septum this 

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:30.780
 It will make our nose look more 

00:02:28.299 --> 00:02:30.780
 narrow 

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:42.310
 well let's remember to outline 

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:45.190
 let's outline to darken the forehead 

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:47.110
 down the sides going down to the temple 

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:49.440
 sides of the nose below the cheekbones 

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:51.450
 and the jaw 

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:54.060
 and now we can start to blur 

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:57.000
 very well we can use a brush or 

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:58.590
 a sponge we have to blur very 

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.720
 well then what we do not want them to have 

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:03.080
 very marked lines only that the 

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:03.080
 shadow 

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:08.320
 to blur the nose we take a 

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:11.040
 brush that is smaller so we 

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:11.040
 it will be easier 

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:27.430
 of course if you do not have a brush like that 

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:27.430
 You can also use your fingers 

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:32.400
 and now let's light up let's go 

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:34.290
 apply it under the eyes doing the 

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:36.300
 famous triangle so known for kim 

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:38.220
 kardashian to illuminate let's go to 

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:39.990
 use a concealer or highlighter that 

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:42.450
 be a little clearer than our tone 

00:03:39.990 --> 00:03:43.980
 of skin we are basically going to apply the 

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:46.820
 illuminator in those areas that 

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:46.820
 we want to highlight 

00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:53.019
 well let's remember 

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:55.690
 the forehead under the eyes the center 

00:03:53.019 --> 00:03:57.920
 of the nose and mouth and finally the 

00:03:55.690 --> 00:04:00.349
 chin 

00:03:57.920 --> 00:04:03.440
 and again we are going to blur everything very 

00:04:00.349 --> 00:04:05.569
 well we want to eliminate those areas but 

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:08.260
 we do not want the famous map effect that does not 

00:04:05.569 --> 00:04:08.260
 it is very bad 

00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:36.910
 and now we can seal everything with 

00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:39.340
 translucent powders or powders with color 

00:04:36.910 --> 00:04:41.050
 you choose this step is very necessary if 

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:42.610
 You have oily skin like me 

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:44.820
 you will avoid shines during 

00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:44.820
 the day 

00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:50.620
 and how a winter is usually so 

00:04:49.090 --> 00:04:52.480
 white I'm going to apply a little bit of 

00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:54.430
 bronzer basically a little bit 

00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:57.540
 over where we have outlined just 

00:04:54.430 --> 00:04:57.540
 a little to give color 

00:04:58.900 --> 00:05:03.430
 and now it's time for blush rouge 

00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:05.410
 let's apply on the cheekbones and 

00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:07.680
 blurring a little bit of circles towards 

00:05:05.410 --> 00:05:07.680
 above 

00:05:12.390 --> 00:05:16.290
 when I have applied all this I like 

00:05:14.700 --> 00:05:19.220
 blur everything to make sure that 

00:05:16.290 --> 00:05:19.220
 there are no lines 

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:23.070
 and if you want an extra lighting 

00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:24.780
 you can apply the droplets of those 

00:05:23.070 --> 00:05:26.770
 liquid illuminators that are very 

00:05:24.780 --> 00:05:29.740
 all right 

00:05:26.770 --> 00:05:32.639
 and we apply on top of the cheekbones and 

00:05:29.740 --> 00:05:32.639
 in the arch of the mouth 

00:05:35.550 --> 00:05:38.610
 Well, guys, you're doing everything 

00:05:37.170 --> 00:05:40.440
 for today's video I hope you have 

00:05:38.610 --> 00:05:42.600

00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:44.340
 next video and if you liked this

 all right
