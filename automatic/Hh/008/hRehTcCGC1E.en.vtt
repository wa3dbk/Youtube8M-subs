00:00:01.509 --> 00:00:04.810
 old man 

00:00:04.810 --> 00:00:08.710
 hi welcome to everyone in this video today dedicated a 

00:00:08.710 --> 00:00:10.280
 tablet a bit special 

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:11.809
 the most mobile burgundy 

00:00:11.809 --> 00:00:15.079
 so I said the word tablets but do not ignite it's not a 

00:00:15.079 --> 00:00:18.140
 tablet as we tend to understand right now 

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:22.029
 we already recognize the packaging that it is by an object necessarily super expensive 

00:00:22.029 --> 00:00:25.079
 but it's past the comfort class packaging for the party 

00:00:25.079 --> 00:00:25.859
 in any case 

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:28.599
 the resource and there they are not taken the lead 

00:00:28.599 --> 00:00:30.089
 so it's a very little product 

00:00:30.089 --> 00:00:32.269
 between 30 and 40 dollars in the usa 

00:00:32.269 --> 00:00:35.180
 and who came from europe because of the success he had there 

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:37.720
 in short during that time you still wonder what it is 

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:41.910
 the opposite perhaps he fell on a magic slate on which 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:43.930
 you spend hours drawing 

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:47.290
 so that's a bit like that except that here we have a touch screen 

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:51.540
 exceeded who will keep the notes you will take or the drawings you 

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:52.520
 will 

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:56.590
 indefinitely and this meaning use energy the only time the device 

00:00:56.590 --> 00:00:59.270
 will consume this moment of erasure 

00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:01.220
 thanks to the trio 

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:05.059
 so basically it's a mix between the concept of magical sagebrush and 

00:01:05.059 --> 00:01:05.790
 plastic 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:08.890
 it is also an explanation for the success of the product 

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:12.960
 which may seem very simplistic but has sold ten times more than expected 

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:16.410
 because people think that's what the other way is to avoid 

00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:18.950
 waste of the small 

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:22.310
 although not at all - paul biya products but they still did 

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:23.610
 a small kit 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:24.990
 to protect the screen 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:27.410
 if you carry 

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:30.100
 we write on it thanks to a small stylus 

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:34.560
 for which there is also a little click in which you will be able to 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:37.560
 the high school 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:41.340
 we are witnessing the psy-tips loving and we will be able that the facts 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:44.670
 behind him a stronger one if allow him to place her against a 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:45.900
 fridge 

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:48.470
 or on any other metallic surface 

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:51.659
 and so 1 to 4 each not deposited behind on wallpaper 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:56.430
 so here is the presentation of this product 

00:01:56.430 --> 00:02:00.670
 minimalist but practical and cheap what makes that seduce a lot 

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:01.390
 of me 

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:03.050
 for the good functioning today at sea
