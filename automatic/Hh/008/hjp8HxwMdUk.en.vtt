00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:08.140
 meet again 

00:00:08.140 --> 00:00:10.300
 We are very happy that you can stick to this stage. 

00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:11.130
 Congratulations 

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:14.180
 You will be at the University of Illinois 

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:15.680
 Have a once-in-a-lifetime experience 

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:17.300
 In the previous episode we provided 

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:19.830
 Some basic information about the school 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:22.040
 Including campus schedule 

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:25.790
 And the guidance that academic advisors can provide you during your studies. 

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:27.480
 Now we have to look 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:31.930
 How can I become a successful student at the University of Illinois? 

00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:36.000
 The class structure and the scoring method are different. 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.290
 Every class is different 

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:40.500
 Some courses are taught by professors 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:44.990
 Some are taught by a teaching assistant, while others are taught by a professor or a teaching assistant. 

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:48.010
 The instructor will provide a basic explanation 

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:49.400
 Tell you how to prepare for this class 

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:51.800
 And they will give you a detailed syllabus 

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:55.400
 Including the assignments specified in class and the date of assignment 

00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:57.940
 Please refer to the syllabus to confirm that your learning status is within expectations. 

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:00.230
 Remember that no one will 

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:02.730
 Staring at you reading or doing homework 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:04.170
 Everything will be entirely up to you 

00:01:09.483 --> 00:01:11.900
 Oh 

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:12.880
 Hi 

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:14.760
 Course grades are usually 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:18.340
 According to your homework, the assignments submitted by the attendance 

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:22.270
 And the scores of other courses are comprehensively calculated. 

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:24.690
 Some course materials contain syllabus 

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:29.010
 May provide jobs on the web and submit online 

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:31.260
 The final total score is based on 

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:32.380
 Calculated throughout the semester's coursework 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:39.420
 You need to actively participate in class activities 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:43.400
 Such as attending class discussions and asking questions 

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:46.789
 Remember that it doesn't matter if you make a mistake or disagree with the professor's opinion. 

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:50.250
 Just keep in touch with professor assistants and consultants 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:53.509
 And be good at using their office hours 

00:01:53.509 --> 00:01:55.390
 And other opportunities 

00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:56.740
 For extra help 

00:01:56.740 --> 00:01:58.729
 Remember when you have problems 

00:01:58.729 --> 00:02:00.930
 And feel that you can't do better when 

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:02.759
 Be sure to discuss with these people 

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:03.259
 All right 

00:02:03.259 --> 00:02:03.979
 Goodbye 

00:02:03.979 --> 00:02:04.830
 worship 

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:06.600
 Attending all courses 

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:09.590
 And make good use of time to learn after class 

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:11.720
 Excellent students every hour of class 

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:13.820
 It should take two to three hours 

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:15.650
 To prepare and do homework 

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:19.890
 So a 15-hour class schedule also means spending at least 45 hours a week studying. 

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:27.480
 You should have noticed now 

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:29.410
 University of Illinois Academic System 

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:32.170
 There may be something different from your national university. 

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:34.620
 Some differences may not be obvious 

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:36.650
 But it can be very troublesome for students. 

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:38.680
 Such as when a student violates 

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:41.020
 Academic integrity guidelines 

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:45.110
 The foundation of academic integrity is honest trust 

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:48.090
 Fair respect and responsibility 

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:50.150
 The basic core of academic integrity 

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:54.270
 It’s the homework you do that must be done by you. 

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:56.940
 Some common violations of academic integrity 

00:02:56.940 --> 00:03:02.230
 Contains cheating forgery plagiarism 

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:04.040
 Or assist others in activities that violate academic integrity 

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:07.790
 Student Code lists violations of academic integrity guidelines 

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:09.130
 And punishment standards 

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:11.510
 The punishment is quite serious 

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:15.410
 May cause the assignment to be deducted or fail 

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:19.200
 Or it is not possible to pass this class or even stay in school. 

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:22.780
 Finally, it may even be ordered to drop out of school. 

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:25.020
 You must abide by the regulations here. 

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:28.230
 Even if these rules are different from your past impressions 

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:30.030
 You can read the student code 

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:31.920
 To learn more about academic integrity 

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:34.430
 Please take advantage of additional campus resources 

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:37.800
 Such as writing counseling group rhetoric and related materials online. 

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:39.750
 For further guidance 

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:43.600
 Admission to university is not limited to academic preparation 

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:48.050
 Every freshman will think about whether he will adapt and whether he will meet new people. 

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:49.730
 How should I prepare for employment? 

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:52.360
 Will I meet like-minded friends? 

00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:54.950
 How can I be friends with American students? 

00:03:54.950 --> 00:03:58.400
 How to adapt to the new regulations and environment? 

00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:01.400
 Participate in extracurricular activities 

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:04.370
 Can help you find the answers to these questions 

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:06.960
 What does it mean to participate in extracurricular activities? 

00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:09.310
 Generally speaking, extracurricular activities refer to 

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:11.400
 Activities outside the classroom 

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:14.730
 But these activities can enrich your learning experience at the University of Illinois. 

00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:18.570
 For example, participating in other groups in the community 

00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:21.399
 Volunteer on campus or volunteer in the community 

00:04:21.399 --> 00:04:23.829
 Participate in leadership training courses 

00:04:23.829 --> 00:04:25.760
 Or participate in sports clubs 

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:28.720
 You can also participate in other extracurricular activities. 

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:32.310
 Some don’t need to actually join the community, such as watching a concert. 

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:36.060
 Participate in weekend activities or activities arranged by the school 

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:37.930
 Participate in these extracurricular activities 

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:39.590
 Can benefit you a lot 

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:41.450
 You will meet other people to expand your social circle. 

00:04:41.450 --> 00:04:46.100
 Helping your future employment and career development 

00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:48.000
 Only by your academic achievements and achievements 

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:50.300
 You will not find a job 

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:52.180
 American employers want to hire those 

00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:55.370
 Ability to demonstrate their all-round development by participating in a variety of extracurricular activities 

00:04:55.370 --> 00:04:56.600
 Participate in extracurricular activities 

00:04:56.600 --> 00:04:59.030
 Can help you develop important skills 

00:04:59.030 --> 00:05:01.390
 These skills are highly valued by employers in any industry. 

00:05:01.390 --> 00:05:04.090
 Leadership 

00:05:04.090 --> 00:05:07.880
 Communication skills - including writing and speaking - and teamwork 

00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:10.730
 Organizational and analytical skills 

00:05:10.730 --> 00:05:13.700
 Participating in these activities can make you progress and have fun 

00:05:13.700 --> 00:05:16.100
 But it’s important to distinguish between primary and secondary 

00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:18.000
 Many students because 

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:19.720
 Excessive participation in activities leads to excessive stress 

00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:23.000
 Try to balance between important activities and academics 

00:05:23.060 --> 00:05:25.240
 Just about it 

00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:28.040
 And review it quickly before you leave. 

00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:31.460
 The structure of the academic system at the University of Illinois 

00:05:31.460 --> 00:05:33.325
 And the requirements for you 

00:05:33.325 --> 00:05:35.740
 May be very different from what you are familiar with in your country. 

00:05:35.740 --> 00:05:37.800
 You are already an adult 

00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:39.650
 We hope that you can study in the process 

00:05:39.650 --> 00:05:41.370
 Responsible for their own 

00:05:41.370 --> 00:05:43.790
 Including familiarity with the following provisions 

00:05:43.790 --> 00:05:46.700
 Such as academic integrity plagiarism 

00:05:46.700 --> 00:05:48.040
 Student code 

00:05:48.040 --> 00:05:50.020
 Use extracurricular time effectively 

00:05:50.020 --> 00:05:51.890
 Development interests and skills development 

00:05:51.890 --> 00:05:53.540
 is very important 

00:05:53.540 --> 00:05:55.790
 a fully developed student 

00:05:55.790 --> 00:05:59.990
 Easier access to potential internship opportunities is also more attractive to future employers 

00:05:59.990 --> 00:06:01.409
 We can tell you about these 

00:06:01.409 --> 00:06:04.630
 Remember if you need 

00:06:04.630 --> 00:06:05.880
 All videos can be viewed repeatedly 

00:06:05.880 --> 00:06:08.690
 Not only that, but you also have a lot of resources to use. 

00:06:08.690 --> 00:06:11.160
 If you have a problem 

00:06:11.160 --> 00:06:13.210
 It's easy to get help 

00:06:13.210 --> 00:06:15.500
 Congratulations on joining the big family at the University of Illinois. 

00:06:15.500 --> 00:06:19.000
 We believe that you can get here soon
