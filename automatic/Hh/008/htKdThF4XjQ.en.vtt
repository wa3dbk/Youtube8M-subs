00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:19.370 
all-natural products but that's what
this<00:02:17.760> whole<00:02:17.820> channel<00:02:18.420> is<00:02:18.570> all<00:02:18.750> about<00:02:18.810> is<00:02:19.260> using

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:19.380 
this whole channel is all about is using

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:22.690 
this whole channel is all about is using
all-natural<00:02:20.180> products<00:02:21.180> from<00:02:21.360> the<00:02:21.510> earth<00:02:21.620> so

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:27.180 
basically I got just a scarf silk scarf

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:30.080 
basically I got just a scarf silk scarf
and<00:02:27.480> all<00:02:28.230> all<00:02:28.680> you<00:02:29.100> have<00:02:29.340> to<00:02:29.490> use<00:02:29.670> something

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:30.090 
and all all you have to use something

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:36.350 
and all all you have to use something
thin<00:02:30.650> before<00:02:31.650> I<00:02:31.680> used<00:02:32.370> a<00:02:33.950> stocking<00:02:35.030> and<00:02:36.030> you

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:36.360 
thin before I used a stocking and you

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:38.000 
thin before I used a stocking and you
just<00:02:36.540> cut<00:02:36.780> a<00:02:36.810> little<00:02:37.050> piece<00:02:37.140> of<00:02:37.290> your<00:02:37.530> stocking

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:38.010 
just cut a little piece of your stocking

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:39.830 
just cut a little piece of your stocking
or<00:02:38.130> you<00:02:38.190> can<00:02:38.340> use<00:02:38.370> just<00:02:38.670> the<00:02:38.790> toe<00:02:39.090> area<00:02:39.330> and

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:39.840 
or you can use just the toe area and

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:41.870 
or you can use just the toe area and
that<00:02:39.930> works<00:02:40.200> really<00:02:40.500> good<00:02:41.070> I<00:02:41.340> don't<00:02:41.790> really

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:41.880 
that works really good I don't really

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:43.460 
that works really good I don't really
have<00:02:42.030> any<00:02:42.180> more<00:02:42.360> stockings<00:02:42.750> right<00:02:42.930> now<00:02:43.080> so<00:02:43.350> I'm

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:43.470 
have any more stockings right now so I'm

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:44.780 
have any more stockings right now so I'm
going<00:02:43.620> to<00:02:43.650> use<00:02:43.860> this<00:02:44.040> silk<00:02:44.340> scarf<00:02:44.610> and

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:44.790 
going to use this silk scarf and

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:47.270 
going to use this silk scarf and
hopefully<00:02:45.210> it<00:02:45.570> will<00:02:45.720> work<00:02:45.780> out<00:02:46.110> well<00:02:46.350> so<00:02:46.830> I'm

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:47.280 
hopefully it will work out well so I'm

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:49.010 
hopefully it will work out well so I'm
going<00:02:47.460> to<00:02:47.490> put<00:02:47.580> the<00:02:47.940> camera<00:02:48.570> down<00:02:48.600> just<00:02:48.960> a

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:49.020 
going to put the camera down just a

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:51.050 
going to put the camera down just a
little<00:02:49.170> bit<00:02:49.290> so<00:02:49.530> you<00:02:49.650> can<00:02:49.710> see<00:02:49.860> a<00:02:50.370> little<00:02:50.880> bit

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:51.060 
little bit so you can see a little bit

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:54.080 
little bit so you can see a little bit
of<00:02:51.120> what<00:02:51.330> I'm<00:02:51.450> doing<00:02:51.840> here<00:02:52.520> so<00:02:53.520> I've<00:02:53.760> got<00:02:53.940> the

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:54.090 
of what I'm doing here so I've got the

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:56.510 
of what I'm doing here so I've got the
scarf<00:02:54.450> and<00:02:54.780> I'm<00:02:55.350> putting<00:02:55.740> it<00:02:55.830> over<00:02:56.010> just<00:02:56.400> a

00:02:56.510 --> 00:02:56.520 
scarf and I'm putting it over just a

00:02:56.520 --> 00:03:00.530 
scarf and I'm putting it over just a
clear<00:02:56.790> bowl<00:02:57.030> here<00:02:57.540> and<00:02:58.610> I'm<00:02:59.610> kind<00:02:59.970> of<00:03:00.060> making<00:03:00.270> a

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:00.540 
clear bowl here and I'm kind of making a

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:04.070 
clear bowl here and I'm kind of making a
little<00:03:00.660> bit<00:03:00.900> of<00:03:00.990> a<00:03:01.080> dip<00:03:01.350> in<00:03:01.590> the<00:03:01.650> bowl<00:03:02.959> and<00:03:03.959> then

00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:04.080 
little bit of a dip in the bowl and then

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:06.800 
little bit of a dip in the bowl and then
i<00:03:04.140> have<00:03:04.470> the<00:03:04.680> flax<00:03:05.010> seed<00:03:05.430> here<00:03:05.820> and<00:03:06.030> i've

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:06.810 
i have the flax seed here and i've

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:10.340 
i have the flax seed here and i've
actually<00:03:08.209> soak<00:03:09.209> them<00:03:09.480> in<00:03:09.570> water<00:03:09.810> and<00:03:10.110> i<00:03:10.200> use

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:10.350 
actually soak them in water and i use

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:11.600 
actually soak them in water and i use
distilled<00:03:10.770> one<00:03:11.040> and<00:03:11.220> this<00:03:11.280> is<00:03:11.459> the

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:11.610 
distilled one and this is the

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:15.110 
distilled one and this is the
consistency<00:03:12.150> of<00:03:12.330> the<00:03:12.510> flax<00:03:13.340> seed<00:03:14.340> when<00:03:14.970> you

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:15.120 
consistency of the flax seed when you

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:18.020 
consistency of the flax seed when you
use<00:03:15.240> of<00:03:15.390> water<00:03:15.750> and<00:03:16.140> I<00:03:17.130> use<00:03:17.400> quite<00:03:17.610> a<00:03:17.700> bit<00:03:17.820> of

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:18.030 
use of water and I use quite a bit of

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:20.390 
use of water and I use quite a bit of
water<00:03:18.239> so<00:03:18.480> it's<00:03:18.660> much<00:03:18.900> more<00:03:18.930> liquidy<00:03:19.739> than<00:03:20.310> I

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:20.400 
water so it's much more liquidy than I

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:22.880 
water so it's much more liquidy than I
would<00:03:20.610> have<00:03:20.640> wanted<00:03:21.000> so<00:03:21.600> I<00:03:21.630> would<00:03:22.110> say<00:03:22.140> the

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:22.890 
would have wanted so I would say the

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:28.370 
would have wanted so I would say the
ratio<00:03:23.370> for<00:03:24.330> flax<00:03:25.050> is<00:03:25.790> probably<00:03:26.790> two<00:03:27.150> to<00:03:27.390> one<00:03:27.630> so

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:28.380 
ratio for flax is probably two to one so

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:30.770 
ratio for flax is probably two to one so
if<00:03:28.560> you<00:03:28.709> use<00:03:28.860> 1<00:03:29.100> cup<00:03:29.130> of<00:03:29.370> flax<00:03:29.760> seeds<00:03:30.060> I<00:03:30.450> would

00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:30.780 
if you use 1 cup of flax seeds I would

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:32.960 
if you use 1 cup of flax seeds I would
use<00:03:30.959> to<00:03:31.290> maybe<00:03:31.769> even<00:03:32.010> two<00:03:32.220> and<00:03:32.370> a<00:03:32.400> half<00:03:32.550> cups<00:03:32.580> of

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:32.970 
use to maybe even two and a half cups of

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:35.180 
use to maybe even two and a half cups of
water<00:03:33.180> I<00:03:33.269> think<00:03:33.570> I<00:03:33.660> used<00:03:33.930> much<00:03:34.590> more<00:03:34.620> than<00:03:35.070> that

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:35.190 
water I think I used much more than that

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:38.120 
water I think I used much more than that
but<00:03:35.880> that's<00:03:36.090> okay<00:03:36.390> so<00:03:37.170> here's<00:03:37.410> a<00:03:37.470> consistency

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:38.130 
but that's okay so here's a consistency

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:41.000 
but that's okay so here's a consistency
here<00:03:38.400> and<00:03:38.900> I'm<00:03:39.900> going<00:03:40.110> to<00:03:40.140> just<00:03:40.350> pour<00:03:40.709> I

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:41.010 
here and I'm going to just pour I

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:43.040 
here and I'm going to just pour I
probably<00:03:41.550> would<00:03:41.880> spoon<00:03:42.209> this<00:03:42.450> out<00:03:42.630> going<00:03:42.900> to

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:43.050 
probably would spoon this out going to

00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:45.110 
probably would spoon this out going to
go<00:03:43.200> ahead<00:03:43.290> and<00:03:43.410> pour<00:03:43.739> a<00:03:43.769> little<00:03:43.980> bit<00:03:44.160> into<00:03:45.000> the

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:45.120 
go ahead and pour a little bit into the

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:50.900 
go ahead and pour a little bit into the
bowl<00:03:45.330> here<00:03:47.480> just<00:03:48.480> for<00:03:48.660> lack<00:03:49.530> of<00:03:49.560> time<00:03:49.910> all

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:50.910 
bowl here just for lack of time all

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:54.290 
bowl here just for lack of time all
right<00:03:51.120> I<00:03:52.160> had<00:03:53.160> little<00:03:53.370> rinse<00:03:53.550> bowl<00:03:53.820> here<00:03:54.060> but

00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:54.300 
right I had little rinse bowl here but

00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:57.940 
right I had little rinse bowl here but
anyway<00:03:54.570> so<00:03:54.959> and<00:03:55.260> then<00:03:55.920> I'm<00:03:56.220> going<00:03:56.400> to<00:03:56.519> take<00:03:56.730> the

00:03:57.940 --> 00:03:57.950 
anyway so and then I'm going to take the

00:03:57.950 --> 00:04:01.250 
anyway so and then I'm going to take the
silk<00:03:58.950> scarf<00:03:59.430> that<00:03:59.820> I<00:04:00.090> put<00:04:00.330> into<00:04:00.480> the<00:04:00.690> bowl<00:04:00.870> and

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:01.260 
silk scarf that I put into the bowl and

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:04.430 
silk scarf that I put into the bowl and
I'm<00:04:01.350> going<00:04:01.560> to<00:04:01.590> wrap<00:04:01.860> it<00:04:01.890> up<00:04:02.070> here<00:04:03.290> and<00:04:04.290> I'm

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:04.440 
I'm going to wrap it up here and I'm

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:07.180 
I'm going to wrap it up here and I'm
just<00:04:04.620> going<00:04:04.769> to<00:04:04.890> squeeze<00:04:05.190> out<00:04:05.489> the<00:04:06.180> gel

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:07.190 
just going to squeeze out the gel

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:10.310 
just going to squeeze out the gel
through<00:04:08.190> the<00:04:09.120> silk<00:04:09.420> scarf<00:04:09.720> and<00:04:09.959> as<00:04:10.049> you<00:04:10.170> can

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:10.320 
through the silk scarf and as you can

00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:12.890 
through the silk scarf and as you can
see<00:04:10.350> it<00:04:10.769> can<00:04:11.100> be<00:04:11.430> a<00:04:11.670> little<00:04:12.120> bit<00:04:12.330> of<00:04:12.420> a<00:04:12.480> tedious

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:12.900 
see it can be a little bit of a tedious

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:15.650 
see it can be a little bit of a tedious
process<00:04:13.280> and<00:04:14.280> you<00:04:14.430> can<00:04:14.610> smooth<00:04:15.000> your<00:04:15.239> fingers

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:15.660 
process and you can smooth your fingers

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:18.469 
process and you can smooth your fingers
over<00:04:16.019> the<00:04:16.049> gel<00:04:16.410> the<00:04:17.310> flax<00:04:17.609> seeds<00:04:17.880> to<00:04:18.120> get<00:04:18.269> more

00:04:18.469 --> 00:04:18.479 
over the gel the flax seeds to get more

00:04:18.479 --> 00:04:22.920 
over the gel the flax seeds to get more
of<00:04:18.660> the<00:04:18.780> gel<00:04:19.019> there<00:04:19.320> and<00:04:20.070> then<00:04:20.940> that

00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:22.930 
of the gel there and then that

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:24.510 
of the gel there and then that
gets<00:04:23.110> it<00:04:23.259> out<00:04:23.380> so<00:04:23.590> I<00:04:23.740> would<00:04:23.919> squeeze<00:04:24.250> this

00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:24.520 
gets it out so I would squeeze this

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:27.960 
gets it out so I would squeeze this
maybe<00:04:24.880> like<00:04:25.530> five<00:04:26.530> or<00:04:26.710> six<00:04:26.889> times<00:04:27.039> let's<00:04:27.729> say

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:27.970 
maybe like five or six times let's say

00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:29.999 
maybe like five or six times let's say
just<00:04:28.180> to<00:04:28.539> get<00:04:28.720> as<00:04:28.900> much<00:04:29.110> of<00:04:29.169> the<00:04:29.410> gel<00:04:29.680> the<00:04:29.830> more

00:04:29.999 --> 00:04:30.009 
just to get as much of the gel the more

00:04:30.009 --> 00:04:32.760 
just to get as much of the gel the more
you<00:04:30.130> squeeze<00:04:30.280> the<00:04:30.789> more<00:04:31.060> jelly<00:04:31.539> you<00:04:32.259> actually

00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:32.770 
you squeeze the more jelly you actually

00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:34.969 
you squeeze the more jelly you actually
get<00:04:33.009> as<00:04:33.520> you<00:04:33.639> can<00:04:33.789> see<00:04:34.000> they're<00:04:34.240> like<00:04:34.660> jelly

00:04:34.969 --> 00:04:34.979 
get as you can see they're like jelly

00:04:34.979 --> 00:04:40.080 
get as you can see they're like jelly
it's<00:04:35.979> kind<00:04:36.190> of<00:04:36.250> a<00:04:36.370> funky<00:04:36.789> look<00:04:37.030> but<00:04:39.090> that's

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:40.090 
it's kind of a funky look but that's

00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:44.460 
it's kind of a funky look but that's
what<00:04:40.210> you<00:04:40.330> get<00:04:40.740> okay<00:04:41.740> and<00:04:42.310> this<00:04:42.970> is<00:04:43.270> the<00:04:44.169> jelly

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:44.470 
what you get okay and this is the jelly

00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:49.409 
what you get okay and this is the jelly
so<00:04:45.070> you<00:04:45.160> can<00:04:45.280> see<00:04:45.870> so<00:04:47.400> that's<00:04:48.400> the<00:04:48.639> jelly<00:04:48.880> now

00:04:49.409 --> 00:04:49.419 
so you can see so that's the jelly now

00:04:49.419 --> 00:04:51.629 
so you can see so that's the jelly now
normally<00:04:49.870> it<00:04:50.380> would<00:04:50.530> be<00:04:50.650> thicker<00:04:50.949> and<00:04:51.220> it<00:04:51.520> will

00:04:51.629 --> 00:04:51.639 
normally it would be thicker and it will

00:04:51.639 --> 00:04:54.600 
normally it would be thicker and it will
get<00:04:51.759> thicker<00:04:52.030> as<00:04:52.380> you<00:04:53.380> squeeze<00:04:54.070> more<00:04:54.340> of<00:04:54.490> it

00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:54.610 
get thicker as you squeeze more of it

00:04:54.610 --> 00:04:57.290 
get thicker as you squeeze more of it
out<00:04:54.759> you<00:04:55.210> get<00:04:55.360> the<00:04:55.479> really<00:04:55.660> thick<00:04:56.020> stuff<00:04:56.320> and

00:04:57.290 --> 00:04:57.300 
out you get the really thick stuff and

00:04:57.300 --> 00:05:01.100 
out you get the really thick stuff and
this<00:04:58.300> is<00:04:58.539> going<00:04:58.720> to<00:04:58.810> make<00:04:58.990> quite<00:04:59.380> a<00:04:59.440> bit<00:04:59.860> of<00:05:00.460> gel

00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:01.110 
this is going to make quite a bit of gel

00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:04.620 
this is going to make quite a bit of gel
as<00:05:02.110> you<00:05:02.320> can<00:05:02.470> see<00:05:02.710> they're<00:05:02.949> all<00:05:03.789> right<00:05:03.970> now

00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:04.630 
as you can see they're all right now

00:05:04.630 --> 00:05:08.909 
as you can see they're all right now
this<00:05:05.199> is<00:05:05.380> ready<00:05:05.590> to<00:05:05.740> go<00:05:05.880> basically<00:05:07.710> so<00:05:08.710> that's

00:05:08.909 --> 00:05:08.919 
this is ready to go basically so that's

00:05:08.919 --> 00:05:11.730 
this is ready to go basically so that's
what<00:05:09.280> you<00:05:09.370> have<00:05:09.520> left<00:05:09.699> you<00:05:09.880> can<00:05:10.030> save<00:05:10.300> this<00:05:10.740> in

00:05:11.730 --> 00:05:11.740 
what you have left you can save this in

00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:13.650 
what you have left you can save this in
a<00:05:11.860> container<00:05:12.280> in<00:05:12.550> a<00:05:13.030> couple<00:05:13.360> of<00:05:13.389> days<00:05:13.509> later

00:05:13.650 --> 00:05:13.660 
a container in a couple of days later

00:05:13.660 --> 00:05:16.080 
a container in a couple of days later
you<00:05:14.229> can<00:05:14.470> soak<00:05:14.919> it<00:05:15.130> a<00:05:15.160> little<00:05:15.370> bit<00:05:15.550> more<00:05:15.849> and

00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:16.090 
you can soak it a little bit more and

00:05:16.090 --> 00:05:18.839 
you can soak it a little bit more and
you<00:05:16.180> get<00:05:16.360> more<00:05:16.539> gel<00:05:16.810> out<00:05:16.990> of<00:05:17.110> it<00:05:17.669> but<00:05:18.669> that's

00:05:18.839 --> 00:05:18.849 
you get more gel out of it but that's

00:05:18.849 --> 00:05:21.180 
you get more gel out of it but that's
quite<00:05:19.539> a<00:05:19.570> bit<00:05:19.810> actually<00:05:20.020> just<00:05:20.680> for<00:05:20.860> one<00:05:21.009> little

00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:21.190 
quite a bit actually just for one little

00:05:21.190 --> 00:05:22.560 
quite a bit actually just for one little
squeeze<00:05:21.610> and<00:05:21.639> I<00:05:21.880> think<00:05:22.150> that<00:05:22.300> that<00:05:22.449> was

00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:22.570 
squeeze and I think that that was

00:05:22.570 --> 00:05:25.740 
squeeze and I think that that was
probably<00:05:22.870> maybe<00:05:23.320> one<00:05:24.099> handful<00:05:24.759> of<00:05:25.090> flax<00:05:25.449> seeds

00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:25.750 
probably maybe one handful of flax seeds

00:05:25.750 --> 00:05:28.260 
probably maybe one handful of flax seeds
with<00:05:26.139> water<00:05:26.440> and<00:05:26.710> then<00:05:26.770> I<00:05:27.520> got<00:05:27.699> the<00:05:27.820> gel<00:05:28.030> and

00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:28.270 
with water and then I got the gel and

00:05:28.270 --> 00:05:30.029 
with water and then I got the gel and
you<00:05:28.479> just<00:05:28.630> take<00:05:28.840> you<00:05:28.990> can<00:05:29.139> take<00:05:29.320> the<00:05:29.500> gel<00:05:29.770> and

00:05:30.029 --> 00:05:30.039 
you just take you can take the gel and

00:05:30.039 --> 00:05:31.800 
you just take you can take the gel and
just<00:05:30.430> put<00:05:30.639> it<00:05:30.669> in<00:05:30.789> your<00:05:30.909> hands<00:05:31.180> just<00:05:31.449> as<00:05:31.659> you

00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:31.810 
just put it in your hands just as you

00:05:31.810 --> 00:05:34.830 
just put it in your hands just as you
would<00:05:32.370> regular<00:05:33.370> gel<00:05:33.639> and<00:05:33.880> you<00:05:34.120> just<00:05:34.330> rub<00:05:34.570> it<00:05:34.690> in

00:05:34.830 --> 00:05:34.840 
would regular gel and you just rub it in

00:05:34.840 --> 00:05:36.540 
would regular gel and you just rub it in
your<00:05:34.930> hair<00:05:35.169> I<00:05:35.349> do<00:05:35.440> it<00:05:35.740> in<00:05:35.800> the<00:05:35.860> morning<00:05:36.039> what<00:05:36.520> I

00:06:02.610 --> 00:06:02.620 
really nice so when it dries it doesn't

00:06:02.620 --> 00:06:05.399 
really nice so when it dries it doesn't
dry<00:06:02.949> hard<00:06:03.430> it<00:06:03.849> dries<00:06:04.210> a<00:06:04.240> little<00:06:04.389> just<00:06:05.289> a<00:06:05.380> little

00:06:05.399 --> 00:06:05.409 
dry hard it dries a little just a little

00:06:05.409 --> 00:06:09.990 
dry hard it dries a little just a little
bit<00:06:07.110> of<00:06:08.110> a<00:06:08.229> hold<00:06:08.560> kind<00:06:09.099> of<00:06:09.190> like<00:06:09.340> if<00:06:09.490> you'd<00:06:09.669> put

00:06:09.990 --> 00:06:10.000 
bit of a hold kind of like if you'd put

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:12.510 
bit of a hold kind of like if you'd put
a<00:06:10.270> light<00:06:10.930> bit<00:06:11.320> of<00:06:11.349> hairspray<00:06:11.680> in<00:06:12.099> your<00:06:12.220> hair

00:06:12.510 --> 00:06:12.520 
a light bit of hairspray in your hair

00:06:12.520 --> 00:06:14.520 
a light bit of hairspray in your hair
and<00:06:12.669> then<00:06:13.240> if<00:06:13.360> you<00:06:13.449> just<00:06:13.630> rub<00:06:13.840> through<00:06:14.169> it<00:06:14.320> it's

00:06:14.520 --> 00:06:14.530 
and then if you just rub through it it's

00:06:14.530 --> 00:06:16.980 
and then if you just rub through it it's
gone<00:06:14.800> and<00:06:15.099> there's<00:06:15.310> no<00:06:15.580> flakiness<00:06:16.120> whatsoever

00:06:19.860 --> 00:06:19.870 
which i think is just fantastic so this

00:06:19.870 --> 00:06:23.370 
which i think is just fantastic so this
is<00:06:19.900> a<00:06:20.110> perfect<00:06:20.650> product<00:06:21.220> okay<00:06:22.169> store<00:06:23.169> it<00:06:23.289> in

00:06:23.370 --> 00:06:23.380 
is a perfect product okay store it in

00:06:23.380 --> 00:06:26.040 
is a perfect product okay store it in
the<00:06:23.409> refrigerator<00:06:23.580> so<00:06:24.580> what<00:06:24.759> I<00:06:24.789> do<00:06:24.909> after<00:06:25.810> that

00:06:26.040 --> 00:06:26.050 
the refrigerator so what I do after that

00:06:26.050 --> 00:06:33.839 
the refrigerator so what I do after that
is<00:06:27.180> I<00:06:28.180> get<00:06:28.810> a<00:06:28.840> jar<00:06:31.620> that<00:06:32.620> I've<00:06:32.889> reused<00:06:33.430> from

00:06:33.839 --> 00:06:33.849 
is I get a jar that I've reused from

00:06:33.849 --> 00:06:35.830 
is I get a jar that I've reused from
this<00:06:34.210> a<00:06:34.240> recycle<00:06:34.779> draw<00:06:34.960> from

00:06:35.830 --> 00:06:35.840 
this a recycle draw from

00:06:35.840 --> 00:06:41.680 
this a recycle draw from
basically<00:06:36.830> and<00:06:37.190> then<00:06:37.220> I<00:06:37.730> just<00:06:37.880> pour<00:06:39.130> the<00:06:40.690> black

00:06:41.680 --> 00:06:41.690 
basically and then I just pour the black

00:06:41.690 --> 00:06:44.080 
basically and then I just pour the black
gel<00:06:42.050> and<00:06:42.260> you<00:06:42.680> get<00:06:42.860> a<00:06:42.889> few<00:06:43.070> flax<00:06:43.370> seeds<00:06:43.639> no<00:06:43.910> big

00:06:44.080 --> 00:06:44.090 
gel and you get a few flax seeds no big

00:06:44.090 --> 00:06:46.629 
gel and you get a few flax seeds no big
deal<00:06:44.270> in<00:06:44.600> there<00:06:44.870> and<00:06:45.350> then<00:06:45.860> I<00:06:45.889> just<00:06:46.010> store<00:06:46.460> that

00:06:46.629 --> 00:06:46.639 
deal in there and then I just store that

00:06:46.639 --> 00:06:49.560 
deal in there and then I just store that
I<00:06:47.449> think<00:06:47.840> it<00:06:47.930> would<00:06:48.050> keep<00:06:48.290> for<00:06:48.680> about<00:06:48.919> maybe

00:06:49.560 --> 00:06:49.570 
I think it would keep for about maybe

00:06:49.570 --> 00:06:53.379 
I think it would keep for about maybe
you<00:06:50.570> know<00:06:50.600> a<00:06:50.930> week<00:06:51.669> and<00:06:52.669> then<00:06:52.729> you<00:06:53.180> probably

00:06:53.379 --> 00:06:53.389 
you know a week and then you probably

00:06:53.389 --> 00:06:55.780 
you know a week and then you probably
want<00:06:53.600> to<00:06:53.630> go<00:06:53.750> ahead<00:06:53.870> and<00:06:54.080> make<00:06:54.229> more<00:06:54.520> flax<00:06:55.520> gel

00:06:55.780 --> 00:06:55.790

00:06:55.790 --> 00:06:57.640 
want to go ahead and make more flax gel
is<00:06:56.030> probably<00:06:56.419> a<00:06:56.510> dollar<00:06:56.810> twenty<00:06:57.020> seven<00:06:57.560> a

00:06:57.640 --> 00:06:57.650 
is probably a dollar twenty seven a

00:06:57.650 --> 00:07:00.790 
is probably a dollar twenty seven a
pound<00:06:57.919> hello<00:06:58.750> much<00:06:59.750> cheaper<00:06:59.780> than<00:07:00.260> buying<00:07:00.560> a

00:07:00.790 --> 00:07:00.800 
pound hello much cheaper than buying a

00:07:00.800 --> 00:07:03.250
