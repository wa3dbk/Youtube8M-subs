00:00:40.959 --> 00:00:40.969 

00:00:40.969 --> 00:00:44.240 

pneumatic<00:00:41.969> drills<00:00:42.329> are<00:00:42.899> a<00:00:42.930> powerful<00:00:43.590> that<00:00:44.100> are

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:44.250 
pneumatic drills are a powerful that are

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:46.130 
pneumatic drills are a powerful that are
used<00:00:44.520> a<00:00:44.940> lot<00:00:44.969> in<00:00:45.180> the<00:00:45.329> construction<00:00:45.870> industry

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140 
used a lot in the construction industry

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:49.220 
used a lot in the construction industry
the<00:00:46.829> often<00:00:47.250> they<00:00:47.399> use<00:00:47.610> to<00:00:48.059> break<00:00:48.300> up<00:00:48.570> pavements

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 
the often they use to break up pavements

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:52.430 
the often they use to break up pavements
or<00:00:49.379> concrete<00:00:49.980> they're<00:00:50.579> very<00:00:50.789> noisy<00:00:51.690> if<00:00:52.170> you

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
or concrete they're very noisy if you

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:56.090 
or concrete they're very noisy if you
use<00:00:52.829> them<00:00:53.670> for<00:00:54.360> too<00:00:54.570> long<00:00:54.870> then<00:00:55.559> you<00:00:55.829> get<00:00:56.070> a

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
use them for too long then you get a

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:58.430 
use them for too long then you get a
condition<00:00:56.879> called<00:00:57.120> white<00:00:57.390> knuckle<00:00:57.930> I<00:00:58.170> don't

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
condition called white knuckle I don't

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:04.090 
condition called white knuckle I don't
know<00:00:58.559> why<00:00:58.739> I<00:00:58.770> know<00:00:59.039> that<00:00:59.370> but<00:01:00.059> I<00:01:00.329> do<00:01:00.649> and

00:01:04.090 --> 00:01:04.100 

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:06.679 

hesitation<00:01:05.100> it's<00:01:05.400> pneumatic<00:01:05.790> drills<00:01:06.330> there's

00:01:06.679 --> 00:01:06.689 
hesitation it's pneumatic drills there's

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:10.609 
hesitation it's pneumatic drills there's
not<00:01:06.869> a<00:01:06.900> bad<00:01:08.510> pneumatic<00:01:09.510> drills<00:01:09.810> I<00:01:10.080> don't<00:01:10.350> think

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619 
not a bad pneumatic drills I don't think

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:13.490 
not a bad pneumatic drills I don't think
having<00:01:10.860> things<00:01:11.340> to<00:01:11.549> do<00:01:11.760> in<00:01:12.000> new<00:01:12.180> Monier<00:01:12.960> but

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159 
to get in the way of a pneumatic drill

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:36.420 
to get in the way of a pneumatic drill
because<00:01:32.640> you<00:01:33.150> would<00:01:33.780> die

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:36.430
