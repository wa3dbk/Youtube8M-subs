00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.870
 multiply 13 and by 25 and when 

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:08.519
 we multiply complex numbers there 

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:10.710
 remember that basically it's how 

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:12.420
 multiply real numbers just that 

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:15.089
 now we have this special number that 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:16.770
 you call the imaginary unit then 

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:18.359
 to perform this operation because 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:21.390
 we can use either the property 

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:23.730
 distributive that is my favorite method or 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:26.099
 well we can use the foil method that 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:27.900
 well also gives the same answer but 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:30.269
 like you have to learn more things and 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:32.489
 it's a little more mechanical than any 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:34.230
 way then let's do it so much with the 

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:36.450
 distributive property as with foil 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:37.829
 to see what we have left is good 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:39.570
 then using the property 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:42.660
 distributive what we are going to do is 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:45.930
 distribute this 13 and on these 2 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:49.140
 humans then we would be 1 minus 3 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:51.270
 and not less 3 and multiplied by this 2 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:59.560
 by 2 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:01:00.760
 13 and 13 and x this 5 and by 5 and simply 

00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:02.680
 I'm using the property 

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:05.740
 distributive that says that if we have to 

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:11.350
 by bmc to others then this is 

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:13.000
 equal to bird more to c here aa is a 

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:15.760
 number here also only that it is between 

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:18.340
 parentheses is one minus three and now 

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:19.600
 we can distribute this over this one and 

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:21.640
 this one about this one 

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:24.040
 for now we distribute on the right 

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:27.160
 then what would we have left? 

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:30.100
 in color orange 2 x 1 we are left 

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:36.190
 all new 2 x minus 3 and we have left 

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:41.170
 minus 6 and 2 by 13 6 and then more and here 

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:42.220
 would be 5 and 15 and look here I'm here 

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:44.619
 you have to take a little care 

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:48.430
 let me do this operation apart we 

00:01:44.619 --> 00:01:51.520
 there are minus three and minus three and 

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:54.430
 five and this would give us then to see 

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:56.370
 minus three times five equals minus 15 

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:59.010
 minus 15 but 

00:01:56.370 --> 00:02:01.800
 and for iu is equal to square here 

00:01:59.010 --> 00:02:04.110
 I put square however and square 

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:07.560
 by definition it is equal to minus 1 so 

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:09.930
 that we would have minus 1 x minus 15 and this 

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:12.570
 from here is equal to 15 in this way 

00:02:09.930 --> 00:02:16.860
 multiplying these two minus 3 and by 5 

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:18.810
 and we have more 15 left good because 

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:21.420
 we have the real parts and the parts 

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:23.190
 imaginary we have to put together the bones 

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:25.350
 joining the real ones with the real ones and the 

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:27.840
 imaginary with the imaginary ones then 

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:30.590
 you have to put this 2 together with this 15 and 

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:34.080
 then this minus 6 and with this plus 5 and 

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:39.210
 have the 2 with the 15 that we have left 

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:41.310
 2 + 15 equals 17 search 17 in 

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:43.890
 real part and then for the part 

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:45.960
 imaginary is minus six and plus five and 

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:48.720
 if we have minus six of something and you 

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:51.000
 we add five we have minus one of that 

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:53.850
 something or be five we subtract six 

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:56.340
 we have less one left and here the something is 

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:58.880
 the imaginary unit and then we 

00:02:56.340 --> 00:03:00.970
 it would be less 

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:04.010
 ok then here we have the answer 

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:05.960
 using the distributive property 

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:08.600
 let me solve the problem again 

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:09.740
 but now using the for method today 

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:11.500
 efe 

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:13.540
 i 

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:15.610
 it's good if he's also going to give us the 

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:17.440
 answer and it's also going to be correct and 

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:19.240
 It has the advantage of being a little more 

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:21.100
 fast but it's also a bit 

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:23.620
 algorithmic in the sense that you 

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:25.150
 you have to agree with things and you can 

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:26.410
 that basically do not understand what you're 

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:28.300
 doing that why I like more the 

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:30.190
 distributive property but of all 

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:31.959
 ways we're going to do it is a method that 

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:34.480
 It guarantees that we do all the 

00:03:31.959 --> 00:03:37.180
 products we need and how it's done 

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:40.860
 Well, here goes efe 

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:44.050
 here goes stop putting the places today 

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:46.270
 so then the idea is that f comes from 

00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:49.600
 first in English multiply the first 

00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:52.900
 two terms is 1 times 2 then it would be 1 

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:58.200
 for 2 then on and the outsiders go 

00:03:52.900 --> 00:04:01.750
 the cars 1 for 5 and it would be 1 for 5 and 

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:04.120
 then go the and the inner or those of 

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:07.060
 in what would be this 3 and with this 2 

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:10.570
 they are the ones inside 2 x minus 3 and 

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:12.850
 so I put 2 for minus 3 and 

00:04:10.570 --> 00:04:14.890
 finally 3 

00:04:12.850 --> 00:04:17.650
 this little bit but good and 

00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:21.520
 l finally go past the 

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:25.750
 last and minus three and by five and then 

00:04:21.520 --> 00:04:29.740
 I'm going to put it minus three minus - minus 

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:31.620
 three and five and it was a bit 

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:34.150
 small but I hope it is understood 

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:37.210
 Then we will make the products to 

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:40.030
 see that we have one left for 12 21 for 12 2 

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:44.590
 I'm going to put it with another color 2 then 

00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:46.780
 would be 1 for five and more 5 and two for 

00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:49.990
 minus three and that would be minus six and 

00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:51.340
 finally minus three and five and that 

00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:55.150
 we had already done it up here, right 

00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:58.030
 we are left with 15 is plus 15 and nothing else 

00:04:55.150 --> 00:05:00.370
 we add reals with real and imaginary 

00:04:58.030 --> 00:05:04.000
 with imaginary this 2 and this 15 are 

00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:05.050
 real this 5 and this minus 6 if they are 

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:08.980
 imaginary 

00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:13.420
 then we have 2 517 left partly in 

00:05:08.980 --> 00:05:16.790
 real part plus 56 is minus 1 then what 

00:05:13.420 --> 00:05:19.250
 we can put better as less 

00:05:16.790 --> 00:05:22.330
 and again it 's the same answer true 

00:05:19.250 --> 00:05:22.330
 17 less
