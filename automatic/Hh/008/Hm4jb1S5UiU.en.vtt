come<00:00:27.779> together<00:00:27.930> and<00:00:28.320> meet<00:00:28.560> so<00:00:29.160> it<00:00:29.220> makes<00:00:29.400> for<00:00:29.490> a

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:29.580 
come together and meet so it makes for a

come together and meet so it makes for a
very<00:00:29.789> dynamic<00:00:30.029> and<00:00:30.570> at<00:00:30.660> times<00:00:30.900> very<00:00:31.230> hostile

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:31.740 
very dynamic and at times very hostile

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:33.350 
very dynamic and at times very hostile
environment<00:00:31.980> you<00:00:32.700> know<00:00:32.820> you<00:00:32.910> could<00:00:33.180> be

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:33.360 
environment you know you could be

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:35.209 
environment you know you could be
punching<00:00:33.780> out<00:00:33.899> through<00:00:34.200> some<00:00:34.500> pretty<00:00:34.829> extreme

00:00:35.209 --> 00:00:35.219 
punching out through some pretty extreme

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:37.220 
punching out through some pretty extreme
measures<00:00:35.700> so<00:00:35.969> definitely<00:00:36.780> looking<00:00:37.020> for

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:37.230 
measures so definitely looking for

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:38.479 
measures so definitely looking for
something<00:00:37.530> that's<00:00:37.680> gonna<00:00:37.770> be<00:00:37.980> able<00:00:38.070> to<00:00:38.219> part

00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:38.489 
something that's gonna be able to part

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:40.490 
something that's gonna be able to part
water<00:00:38.700> and<00:00:39.270> be<00:00:39.420> able<00:00:39.629> to<00:00:39.719> charge<00:00:40.020> through<00:00:40.350> the

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:40.500 
water and be able to charge through the

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:42.560 
water and be able to charge through the
wave<00:00:40.680> without<00:00:41.160> it<00:00:41.550> being<00:00:41.879> able<00:00:42.059> to<00:00:42.180> catch<00:00:42.390> the

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570 
wave without it being able to catch the

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:44.869 
wave without it being able to catch the
boat<00:00:42.780> and<00:00:43.050> really<00:00:43.590> turn<00:00:43.800> it<00:00:43.950> too<00:00:44.100> much<00:00:44.309> the

00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:44.879 
boat and really turn it too much the

boat is very stable I like the first and

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:51.260 
boat is very stable I like the first and
second<00:00:49.800> stability<00:00:50.340> in<00:00:50.460> it<00:00:50.610> and<00:00:50.820> I<00:00:50.969> have<00:00:51.149> to
