00:00:13.810 --> 00:00:19.720
 hello everyone how about i went out hd rank 

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:20.800
 comment on another fifa video and then the day 

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:23.650
 today I bring you all the innovations 

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:26.830
 that will leave for then so longed for game 

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:29.350
 that is' â€‹â€‹fifa 2016 more than anything 

00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:31.660
 changes are in career mode since in 

00:00:29.350 --> 00:00:33.970
 career mode is what plays the most 

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:36.160
 people apart from ultime team and well here 

00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:39.160
 how are you going to see then the new things that 

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:40.990
 they left are the tournaments well this is going to 

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:42.880
 have the opportunity to reject or 

00:00:40.990 --> 00:00:44.800
 accept tournaments types as is 

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:46.480
 also there on the screen are 11 

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:49.480
 million the reward of 10 million 

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:51.520
 depending on how it was the truth that 

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:54.250
 obviously the difficulty will go up 

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:57.520
 depending on how expensive the price is 

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:59.860
 and also because fifa got the 

00:00:57.520 --> 00:01:01.600
 licenses of the bundesliga and now yes it goes 

00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:03.850
 to be like the premier league that has 

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:07.119
 the entire license as well as 

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:09.580
 commentators and the stadiums really like 

00:01:07.119 --> 00:01:12.070
 here you are going to see also here they are says to 

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:14.080
 the players to follow and it will come out as 

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:16.119
 all the statistics of the players 

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:19.030
 at what moment do they love and then to me 

00:01:16.119 --> 00:01:21.220
 does this very very well why 

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:23.770
 black a little more realism at 

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:26.020
 just as the best they added is 

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:28.299
 train players in career mode 

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:31.000
 It has been very cool as if you have a 

00:01:28.299 --> 00:01:33.369
 problem that you complain that this one 

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:37.000
 never got me up because now is your way 

00:01:33.369 --> 00:01:40.119
 so that you can raise your own hands 

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:43.690
 the average of that player or the global 

00:01:40.119 --> 00:01:45.790
 how is 79-80 that you see it the more up 

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:47.350
 more millions will be worth this player 

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:49.570
 depending on how long climb 

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:52.450
 obviously some are going to battle for 

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:55.630
 raise others will go up short but 

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:57.009
 this will vary so another thing is that you 

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:59.080
 you can choose to deliver them 

00:01:57.009 --> 00:02:01.090
 personally or simulate 

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:02.920
 workouts so do not worry 

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:04.990
 If you do not want to train 

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:08.289
 personally the bag in batches does not 

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:09.489
 it simulates and so work alone but 

00:02:08.289 --> 00:02:12.430
 Of course it's going to be a little more 

00:02:09.489 --> 00:02:15.700
 defective and it will not be so successful 

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:17.890
 as you want them to have because they do not 

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:19.830
 you are going to simulate and that means that 

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:22.360
 depending on how the player gives 

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:25.180
 personally how is it going to be here 

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:28.030
 many types of workouts 

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:30.670
 and compare speed for defense to 

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:33.489
 mark your man there are many many 

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:35.469
 workouts are around 30 if not 

00:02:33.489 --> 00:02:37.659
 I'm wrong and then it's made to me 

00:02:35.469 --> 00:02:39.640
 excellent in the hand true this of 

00:02:37.659 --> 00:02:42.219
 to be able to enter your players since 

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:45.099
 some stagnate and do not rise in average 

00:02:42.219 --> 00:02:47.109
 just like how do I tell you are going to 

00:02:45.099 --> 00:02:49.750
 to be able to make infinite changes in 

00:02:47.109 --> 00:02:51.879
 friendly tournaments now if 

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:54.340
 you're going to be worth 10 million that you do not 

00:02:51.879 --> 00:02:56.799
 I want an extra 10 million and then 

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:58.959
 this formed boys hopefully readers of 

00:02:56.799 --> 00:03:00.129
 video make like subscribe without favorites 

00:02:58.959 --> 00:03:02.459
 and until next time 

00:03:00.129 --> 00:03:02.459
 goodbye 

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:08.560
 do not 

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:16.140
 and me 

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:16.140
 as in this case 

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:19.710
 it's late 

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:27.670
 they are thousands
