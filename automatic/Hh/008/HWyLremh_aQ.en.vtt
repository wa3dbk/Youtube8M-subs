00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:14.690 
and I just brought all of it without

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:26.950 
and I just brought all of it without
much<00:00:15.170> of<00:00:15.320> a<00:00:15.379> plan<00:00:24.400> we<00:00:25.400> actually<00:00:25.849> took<00:00:26.179> metal

00:00:26.950 --> 00:00:26.960 
much of a plan we actually took metal

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:28.900 
much of a plan we actually took metal
letters<00:00:27.259> and<00:00:27.589> we<00:00:27.710> press<00:00:28.070> them<00:00:28.310> into<00:00:28.490> the<00:00:28.669> glass

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:28.910 
letters and we press them into the glass

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:31.900 
letters and we press them into the glass
and<00:00:29.179> so<00:00:29.390> each<00:00:29.599> form<00:00:30.259> in<00:00:30.589> this<00:00:31.279> series<00:00:31.699> actually

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:31.910 
and so each form in this series actually

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:33.730 
and so each form in this series actually
are<00:00:32.240> different<00:00:32.630> shapes<00:00:32.900> but<00:00:33.200> they<00:00:33.320> all<00:00:33.470> kind

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:33.740 
are different shapes but they all kind

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:35.320 
are different shapes but they all kind
of<00:00:33.800> start<00:00:34.040> with<00:00:34.100> the<00:00:34.310> same<00:00:34.520> bubble<00:00:34.910> but<00:00:35.090> some

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:35.330 
of start with the same bubble but some

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:37.390 
of start with the same bubble but some
have<00:00:35.540> a<00:00:35.570> taller<00:00:35.900> spout<00:00:36.410> and<00:00:36.800> some<00:00:37.040> are<00:00:37.190> comes

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:37.400 
have a taller spout and some are comes

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:39.730 
have a taller spout and some are comes
short<00:00:37.670> and<00:00:37.820> squat<00:00:38.120> like<00:00:38.300> this<00:00:38.590> we<00:00:39.590> were<00:00:39.680> able

00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:39.740 
short and squat like this we were able

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:42.520 
short and squat like this we were able
to<00:00:40.010> spell<00:00:40.400> out<00:00:40.580> and<00:00:40.790> stuff<00:00:41.180> so<00:00:42.020> we<00:00:42.140> need<00:00:42.290> to<00:00:42.380> do

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:42.530 
to spell out and stuff so we need to do

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:44.140 
to spell out and stuff so we need to do
something<00:00:42.860> where<00:00:43.190> we<00:00:43.340> can<00:00:43.490> put<00:00:43.700> the<00:00:43.730> letters

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:44.150 
something where we can put the letters

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:47.050 
something where we can put the letters
in<00:00:44.180> it's<00:00:45.080> more<00:00:45.440> playful<00:00:45.830> than<00:00:46.070> what<00:00:46.790> I<00:00:46.820> ever

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:47.060 
in it's more playful than what I ever

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:49.480 
in it's more playful than what I ever
get<00:00:47.300> to<00:00:47.360> do<00:00:47.600> at<00:00:47.750> work<00:00:47.900> you're<00:00:48.440> confined<00:00:49.160> by

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:49.490 
get to do at work you're confined by

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:52.210 
get to do at work you're confined by
paper<00:00:49.970> by<00:00:50.390> presses<00:00:50.930> by<00:00:51.170> what<00:00:51.380> the<00:00:51.530> media<00:00:51.680> can

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:52.220 
paper by presses by what the media can

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:55.240 
paper by presses by what the media can
do<00:00:52.430> and<00:00:52.790> so<00:00:53.420> this<00:00:53.600> was<00:00:53.780> a<00:00:53.810> chance<00:00:54.170> to<00:00:54.830> be<00:00:54.980> a<00:00:55.010> lot

00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:55.250 
do and so this was a chance to be a lot

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:57.160 
do and so this was a chance to be a lot
more<00:00:55.430> organic<00:00:55.850> in<00:00:56.210> a<00:00:56.330> way<00:00:56.480> and<00:00:56.720> you<00:00:56.840> know<00:00:56.960> how

00:00:57.160 --> 00:00:57.170 
more organic in a way and you know how

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:58.330 
more organic in a way and you know how
it<00:00:57.260> would<00:00:57.380> interact<00:00:57.650> with<00:00:57.890> different

00:00:58.330 --> 00:00:58.340 
it would interact with different

00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:01.630 
it would interact with different
materials<00:00:58.910> like<00:00:59.150> wood<00:00:59.450> metal<00:00:59.950> if<00:01:00.950> I<00:01:01.100> had<00:01:01.370> found

00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:01.640 
materials like wood metal if I had found

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:03.790 
materials like wood metal if I had found
these<00:01:01.910> letter<00:01:02.330> forms<00:01:02.900> that<00:01:03.020> are<00:01:03.140> really<00:01:03.440> thin

00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:03.800 
these letter forms that are really thin

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:05.980 
these letter forms that are really thin
wood<00:01:04.100> or<00:01:04.369> in<00:01:04.549> there<00:01:04.759> they<00:01:05.239> blew<00:01:05.449> these<00:01:05.630> test

00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:05.990 
wood or in there they blew these test

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:08.350 
wood or in there they blew these test
tubes<00:01:06.260> and<00:01:06.440> then<00:01:06.620> we<00:01:06.820> poured<00:01:07.820> all<00:01:07.970> the<00:01:08.000> letters

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:08.360 
tubes and then we poured all the letters

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:11.110 
tubes and then we poured all the letters
in<00:01:08.630> to<00:01:09.050> them<00:01:09.230> and<00:01:09.530> they<00:01:09.680> started<00:01:10.370> to<00:01:10.490> burn<00:01:10.730> and

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:11.120 
in to them and they started to burn and

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:13.240 
in to them and they started to burn and
come<00:01:11.360> Boston<00:01:11.930> we<00:01:12.290> kind<00:01:12.470> of<00:01:12.560> let<00:01:12.710> them<00:01:12.830> burn<00:01:12.980> for

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:13.250 
come Boston we kind of let them burn for

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:14.620 
come Boston we kind of let them burn for
a<00:01:13.280> while<00:01:13.460> and<00:01:13.610> poured<00:01:13.850> them<00:01:13.970> out<00:01:14.120> so<00:01:14.330> we<00:01:14.360> ended

00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:14.630 
a while and poured them out so we ended

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:16.510 
a while and poured them out so we ended
up<00:01:14.750> with<00:01:14.960> all<00:01:15.110> of<00:01:15.140> these<00:01:15.350> kind<00:01:15.890> of<00:01:15.980> charred

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:16.520 
up with all of these kind of charred

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:18.370 
up with all of these kind of charred
letters<00:01:17.090> which<00:01:17.390> are<00:01:17.570> really<00:01:17.750> beautiful

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:18.380 
letters which are really beautiful

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:20.770 
letters which are really beautiful
I<00:01:18.560> imagine<00:01:19.430> having<00:01:19.730> a<00:01:19.820> series<00:01:20.210> of<00:01:20.240> vessels

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:20.780 
I imagine having a series of vessels

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:22.690 
I imagine having a series of vessels
with<00:01:20.960> these<00:01:21.110> different<00:01:21.560> stages<00:01:22.250> of<00:01:22.400> burnt

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:22.700 
with these different stages of burnt

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:24.490 
with these different stages of burnt
letters<00:01:23.360> in<00:01:23.600> them<00:01:23.780> so<00:01:23.960> it<00:01:24.020> was<00:01:24.110> almost<00:01:24.290> like

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:24.500 
letters in them so it was almost like

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:26.760 
letters in them so it was almost like
thinking<00:01:25.130> of<00:01:25.220> an<00:01:25.340> art<00:01:25.520> piece<00:01:25.760> in<00:01:25.970> a<00:01:26.030> way

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:26.770 
thinking of an art piece in a way

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:29.639 
thinking of an art piece in a way
a<00:01:26.859> little<00:01:27.609> pair<00:01:27.939> of<00:01:28.210> two<00:01:28.600> one<00:01:29.140> orange<00:01:29.530> one

00:01:29.639 --> 00:01:29.649 
a little pair of two one orange one

00:01:29.649 --> 00:01:34.980 
a little pair of two one orange one

00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:34.990 
clear yeah what about that one right on

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:37.200 
clear yeah what about that one right on
the<00:01:35.200> bottom<00:01:35.590> like<00:01:35.799> the<00:01:35.979> color<00:01:36.189> of<00:01:36.399> your<00:01:36.610> fire

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:37.210 
the bottom like the color of your fire

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:39.809 
the bottom like the color of your fire
when<00:01:37.630> you<00:01:37.719> open<00:01:38.049> the<00:01:38.140> door<00:01:38.350> it<00:01:38.679> was<00:01:39.460> a<00:01:39.520> little

00:01:39.809 --> 00:01:39.819 
when you open the door it was a little

00:01:39.819 --> 00:01:42.630 
when you open the door it was a little
bit<00:01:40.000> wary<00:01:40.299> of<00:01:40.450> color<00:01:40.990> so<00:01:41.409> I'm<00:01:41.920> curious<00:01:42.280> about

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:42.640 
bit wary of color so I'm curious about

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:48.590 
bit wary of color so I'm curious about
how<00:01:42.909> that<00:01:42.969> might<00:01:43.179> work

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:52.369
