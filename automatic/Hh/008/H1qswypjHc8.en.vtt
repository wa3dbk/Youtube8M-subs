equation that perhaps L is don't pass at

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:20.420 
equation that perhaps L is don't pass at
the<00:00:15.990> moment<00:00:18.259> well<00:00:19.259> all<00:00:19.650> bits<00:00:19.980> and<00:00:20.130> pieces<00:00:20.400> that

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:20.430 
the moment well all bits and pieces that

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:22.130 
the moment well all bits and pieces that
they<00:00:20.759> have<00:00:20.970> you<00:00:21.150> know<00:00:21.180> is<00:00:21.509> there's<00:00:21.960> no

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:22.140 
they have you know is there's no

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:23.630 
they have you know is there's no
something<00:00:22.590> that<00:00:22.740> they<00:00:22.890> don't<00:00:23.039> how<00:00:23.310> that

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:23.640 
something that they don't how that

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:26.690 
something that they don't how that
affected<00:00:24.270> acquire<00:00:25.169> of<00:00:25.529> what<00:00:25.950> are<00:00:26.070> two<00:00:26.220> bits<00:00:26.520> I

00:00:26.690 --> 00:00:26.700 
affected acquire of what are two bits I

00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:29.749 
affected acquire of what are two bits I
think<00:00:27.270> we<00:00:27.390> need<00:00:27.540> to<00:00:27.719> still<00:00:28.469> put<00:00:29.340> into<00:00:29.669> the

00:00:29.749 --> 00:00:29.759 
think we need to still put into the

00:00:29.759 --> 00:00:33.080 
think we need to still put into the
scored<00:00:30.410> but<00:00:31.410> it's<00:00:31.890> another<00:00:32.219> and<00:00:32.820> a<00:00:32.940> lot

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:33.090 
scored but it's another and a lot

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:35.569 
scored but it's another and a lot
personal<00:00:34.079> rollerball<00:00:34.500> d<00:00:34.649> and<00:00:34.890> a<00:00:34.980> little<00:00:35.460> bit

00:00:35.569 --> 00:00:35.579 
personal rollerball d and a little bit

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:38.240 
personal rollerball d and a little bit
more<00:00:35.790> experience<00:00:36.180> and<00:00:36.559> I<00:00:37.559> think<00:00:37.800> it'll<00:00:38.010> be<00:00:38.129> a

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:38.250 
more experience and I think it'll be a

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:40.369 
more experience and I think it'll be a
good<00:00:38.640> addition<00:00:38.879> much<00:00:39.660> an<00:00:39.809> experience<00:00:40.260> but

00:00:40.369 --> 00:00:40.379 
good addition much an experience but

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:41.959 
good addition much an experience but
he's<00:00:40.530> still<00:00:40.739> relatively<00:00:41.249> young<00:00:41.429> isn't<00:00:41.879> he

00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:41.969 
he's still relatively young isn't he

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:45.259 
he's still relatively young isn't he
still<00:00:42.149> 23<00:00:42.539> years<00:00:42.989> old<00:00:43.140> so<00:00:43.469> to<00:00:44.249> film<00:00:44.489> it<00:00:44.640> will

00:00:45.259 --> 00:00:45.269 
still 23 years old so to film it will

00:00:45.269 --> 00:00:46.970 
still 23 years old so to film it will
cease<00:00:45.449> honor<00:00:45.660> to<00:00:45.899> your<00:00:46.019> contract<00:00:46.559> in<00:00:46.769> this

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:50.579 
longevity their continuity yeah also we

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:53.720

all<00:00:50.730> saw<00:00:50.940> it<00:00:50.969> we<00:00:51.710> I<00:00:52.710> think<00:00:53.010> it<00:00:53.370> is<00:00:53.399> an

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
all saw it we I think it is an

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:55.399 
all saw it we I think it is an
indication<00:00:54.179> of<00:00:54.449> the<00:00:54.659> level<00:00:54.989> of<00:00:55.050> player<00:00:55.289> that

00:00:55.399 --> 00:00:55.409 
indication of the level of player that

00:00:55.409 --> 00:00:59.209 
indication of the level of player that
we<00:00:55.739> would<00:00:55.920> have<00:00:55.949> had<00:00:56.129> no<00:00:56.159> chance<00:00:56.550> or<00:00:56.819> get<00:00:58.219> any

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219 
we would have had no chance or get any

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:01.790 
we would have had no chance or get any
time<00:00:59.460> in<00:00:59.819> the<00:00:59.940> last<00:00:59.969> year<00:01:00.390> any<00:01:01.170> table<00:01:01.620> in<00:01:01.710> the

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:01.800 
time in the last year any table in the

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:05.420 
time in the last year any table in the
last<00:01:01.979> month<00:01:02.420> until<00:01:03.420> the<00:01:03.629> last<00:01:03.809> seven<00:01:04.739> TDs<00:01:05.129> and

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430

we<00:01:21.149> do<00:01:21.299> with<00:01:22.100> thoughtfully<00:01:23.100> everybody<00:01:23.520> who

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
we do with thoughtfully everybody who

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:25.700 
we do with thoughtfully everybody who
comes<00:01:23.850> up<00:01:24.090> we<00:01:24.270> have<00:01:24.360> to<00:01:24.539> think<00:01:25.079> display<00:01:25.500> what

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710 
comes up we have to think display what

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:27.459 
comes up we have to think display what
we've<00:01:25.860> got<00:01:26.130> here<00:01:26.159> for<00:01:26.549> people<00:01:26.820> who<00:01:26.909> don't<00:01:27.090> know

00:01:27.459 --> 00:01:27.469 
we've got here for people who don't know

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:29.990 
we've got here for people who don't know
and<00:01:28.469> he<00:01:28.619> was<00:01:28.799> terribly<00:01:29.159> impressed<00:01:29.700> you<00:01:29.880> know

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
and he was terribly impressed you know

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.139 
and he was terribly impressed you know
and<00:01:30.149> i<00:01:30.600> think<00:01:31.219> in<00:01:32.219> vitamin<00:01:32.729> made<00:01:32.909> a<00:01:32.939> big

00:01:33.139 --> 00:01:33.149 
and i think in vitamin made a big

00:01:33.149 --> 00:01:35.690 
and i think in vitamin made a big
impression<00:01:33.479> on<00:01:33.750> and<00:01:34.020> made<00:01:34.950> it<00:01:35.100> easier<00:01:35.460> because

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
impression on and made it easier because

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:39.980 
impression on and made it easier because
no<00:01:36.299> they<00:01:36.360> are<00:01:36.600> very<00:01:37.399> close<00:01:38.399> down<00:01:38.609> south<00:01:38.969> but<00:01:39.750> i

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:39.990 
no they are very close down south but i

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:42.289 
no they are very close down south but i
think<00:01:40.590> this<00:01:40.710> is<00:01:40.920> the<00:01:41.280> base<00:01:41.490> colligative<00:01:41.969> come

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:42.299 
think this is the base colligative come

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:44.240 
think this is the base colligative come
to<00:01:42.479> if<00:01:42.630> I<00:01:42.810> his<00:01:42.960> own<00:01:43.079> progress<00:01:43.439> at<00:01:43.770> the<00:01:43.829> minute<00:01:44.039> I

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250 
to if I his own progress at the minute I

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:46.910 
to if I his own progress at the minute I
saw<00:01:44.640> see<00:01:45.090> another<00:01:45.270> plant<00:01:45.630> coming<00:01:45.990> up<00:01:46.079> from<00:01:46.380> on

internationals but because of your

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:54.410 
internationals but because of your
