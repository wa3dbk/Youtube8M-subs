00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:40.439 
it's fairly common one so I mean it's

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:45.469 
it's fairly common one so I mean it's
not<00:01:40.560> not<00:01:40.890> really<00:01:41.070> that<00:01:41.189> difficult<00:01:42.079> and<00:01:44.479> moving

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:45.479 
not not really that difficult and moving

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:47.780 
not not really that difficult and moving
over<00:01:45.600> this<00:01:46.049> way<00:01:46.290> you<00:01:47.130> have<00:01:47.250> the<00:01:47.369> dipstick<00:01:47.670> for

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:47.790 
over this way you have the dipstick for

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:50.120 
over this way you have the dipstick for
the<00:01:47.970> oil<00:01:48.149> which<00:01:48.390> is<00:01:48.540> thank<00:01:48.840> God<00:01:48.990> made<00:01:49.710> of<00:01:49.829> metal

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
the oil which is thank God made of metal

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:51.679 
the oil which is thank God made of metal
I<00:01:50.250> can't<00:01:50.460> stand<00:01:50.729> me<00:01:50.850> get<00:01:51.030> in<00:01:51.119> a<00:01:51.210> new<00:01:51.329> car<00:01:51.570> and

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:51.689 
I can't stand me get in a new car and

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:53.480 
I can't stand me get in a new car and
they<00:01:51.780> made<00:01:51.930> of<00:01:52.079> plastic<00:01:52.619> I<00:01:52.710> know<00:01:52.770> it's<00:01:53.159> a<00:01:53.250> small

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:53.490 
they made of plastic I know it's a small

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:55.850 
they made of plastic I know it's a small
niggly<00:01:53.970> thing<00:01:54.180> but<00:01:54.450> still<00:01:54.689> I<00:01:54.750> mean<00:01:54.869> really<00:01:55.710> it

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860 
niggly thing but still I mean really it

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:57.050 
niggly thing but still I mean really it
goes<00:01:56.009> in<00:01:56.189> the<00:01:56.310> engine<00:01:56.579> it<00:01:56.640> should<00:01:56.790> be<00:01:56.880> made<00:01:57.030> out

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.060 
goes in the engine it should be made out

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:59.469 
goes in the engine it should be made out
of<00:01:57.180> metal<00:01:57.680> of<00:01:58.680> course<00:01:58.829> you<00:01:59.009> have<00:01:59.130> your<00:01:59.159> oil

00:01:59.469 --> 00:01:59.479 
of metal of course you have your oil

00:01:59.479 --> 00:02:01.609 
of metal of course you have your oil
this<00:02:00.479> is<00:02:00.630> where<00:02:00.780> you<00:02:00.899> would<00:02:00.990> add<00:02:01.170> oil<00:02:01.380> of

00:02:01.609 --> 00:02:01.619 
this is where you would add oil of

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:02.959 
this is where you would add oil of
course<00:02:01.829> you<00:02:01.979> don't<00:02:02.130> check<00:02:02.340> the<00:02:02.430> oil<00:02:02.579> from<00:02:02.759> here

00:02:02.959 --> 00:02:02.969 
course you don't check the oil from here

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:04.429 
course you don't check the oil from here
you<00:02:03.060> can<00:02:03.210> check<00:02:03.390> your<00:02:03.479> blow-by<00:02:03.869> from<00:02:04.140> up<00:02:04.290> here

00:02:04.429 --> 00:02:04.439 
you can check your blow-by from up here

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:06.800 
you can check your blow-by from up here
but<00:02:04.619> too<00:02:04.770> much<00:02:05.490> you<00:02:05.909> just<00:02:05.939> look<00:02:06.270> over<00:02:06.420> here<00:02:06.689> and

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:06.810 
but too much you just look over here and

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:08.449 
but too much you just look over here and
check<00:02:06.990> your<00:02:07.079> oil<00:02:07.140> because<00:02:07.590> it's<00:02:07.770> not<00:02:08.250> going<00:02:08.369> to

00:02:08.449 --> 00:02:08.459 
check your oil because it's not going to

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:10.680 
check your oil because it's not going to
do<00:02:08.610> much<00:02:08.910> good

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:10.690 
do much good

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:12.820 
do much good
this<00:02:11.690> is<00:02:11.840> kind<00:02:12.020> of<00:02:12.050> a<00:02:12.140> different<00:02:12.440> one<00:02:12.560> that<00:02:12.740> I'm

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:12.830 
this is kind of a different one that I'm

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:14.860 
this is kind of a different one that I'm
used<00:02:13.040> to<00:02:13.130> it<00:02:13.310> kind<00:02:13.520> of<00:02:13.580> goes<00:02:14.210> halfway<00:02:14.480> and

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:14.870 
used to it kind of goes halfway and

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:17.680 
used to it kind of goes halfway and
clicks<00:02:15.800> down<00:02:16.130> I<00:02:16.430> mean<00:02:16.940> so<00:02:17.090> the<00:02:17.210> Honda<00:02:17.510> ones

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:17.690 
clicks down I mean so the Honda ones

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:19.060 
clicks down I mean so the Honda ones
where<00:02:17.930> you<00:02:17.990> just<00:02:18.020> keep<00:02:18.530> turning<00:02:18.680> and<00:02:18.980> turning

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:19.070 
where you just keep turning and turning

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:22.840 
where you just keep turning and turning
and<00:02:19.370> turning<00:02:19.810> but<00:02:20.810> in<00:02:20.960> any<00:02:21.140> case<00:02:21.640> over<00:02:22.640> here

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:22.850 
and turning but in any case over here

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:24.340 
and turning but in any case over here
you<00:02:23.000> have<00:02:23.180> your<00:02:23.210> reservoir<00:02:23.660> for<00:02:23.930> the<00:02:23.960> radiator

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:24.350 
you have your reservoir for the radiator

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:27.160 
you have your reservoir for the radiator
that's<00:02:25.010> all<00:02:25.220> good<00:02:25.460> stuff<00:02:25.900> remember<00:02:26.900> don't

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:27.170 
that's all good stuff remember don't

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:29.080 
that's all good stuff remember don't
open<00:02:27.290> it<00:02:27.530> when<00:02:27.650> it's<00:02:27.770> hot<00:02:27.890> ok<00:02:28.220> that<00:02:28.790> would<00:02:28.880> not

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:29.090 
open it when it's hot ok that would not

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:34.120 
open it when it's hot ok that would not
be<00:02:29.210> good<00:02:30.130> and<00:02:31.130> this<00:02:31.880> is<00:02:31.940> a<00:02:33.130> weird

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:34.130 
be good and this is a weird

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:35.500 
be good and this is a weird
configuration<00:02:34.460> because<00:02:35.180> I'm<00:02:35.270> used<00:02:35.450> to

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:35.510 
configuration because I'm used to

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:37.660 
configuration because I'm used to
everything<00:02:35.930> over<00:02:36.140> here<00:02:36.230> being<00:02:37.040> on<00:02:37.160> this<00:02:37.430> side

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:37.670 
everything over here being on this side

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:39.550 
everything over here being on this side
basically<00:02:38.600> I'm<00:02:38.690> used<00:02:38.870> to<00:02:38.900> the<00:02:39.020> exhaust<00:02:39.290> being

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:39.560 
basically I'm used to the exhaust being

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:41.950 
basically I'm used to the exhaust being
at<00:02:39.650> the<00:02:39.740> front<00:02:39.920> and<00:02:40.190> the<00:02:40.790> intake<00:02:41.480> being<00:02:41.750> at<00:02:41.870> the

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:41.960 
at the front and the intake being at the

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:44.260 
at the front and the intake being at the
back<00:02:42.140> but<00:02:42.860> it's<00:02:43.580> not<00:02:43.790> really<00:02:43.970> that<00:02:44.120> much

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:44.270 
back but it's not really that much

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:45.630 
back but it's not really that much
different

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:45.640 
different

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:48.940 
different
you<00:02:46.640> have<00:02:46.760> your<00:02:46.880> alternator<00:02:47.330> up<00:02:47.510> top<00:02:47.810> and<00:02:48.770> that

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:48.950 
you have your alternator up top and that

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:49.480 
you have your alternator up top and that
was<00:02:49.070> hot

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:49.490 
was hot

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:51.100 
was hot
of<00:02:49.910> course<00:02:50.150> there<00:02:50.300> is<00:02:50.390> no<00:02:50.540> power<00:02:50.720> steering

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:51.110 
of course there is no power steering

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:52.390 
of course there is no power steering
pump<00:02:51.320> in<00:02:51.440> this<00:02:51.530> vehicle<00:02:51.770> because<00:02:52.130> it<00:02:52.250> does

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:52.400 
pump in this vehicle because it does

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:54.490 
pump in this vehicle because it does
have<00:02:52.580> electric<00:02:52.970> power<00:02:53.090> steering<00:02:53.440> down<00:02:54.440> there

00:02:54.490 --> 00:02:54.500 
have electric power steering down there

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:56.940 
have electric power steering down there

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:52.880 
it really will not like the camera is

going to focus anyways just a note that
these<00:03:55.700> cars<00:03:55.970> do<00:03:56.269> not<00:03:56.480> have<00:03:56.780> timing<00:03:57.320> chains<00:03:57.590> ok

00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:01.340 
these do have timing belts it's 150,000

these do have timing belts it's 150,000
miles<00:04:01.489> interval<00:04:02.330> though<00:04:02.480> so<00:04:02.720> it's<00:04:02.870> not<00:04:03.019> like

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:03.170 
miles interval though so it's not like

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:04.720 
miles interval though so it's not like
you're<00:04:03.500> going<00:04:03.799> to<00:04:03.890> have<00:04:04.010> to<00:04:04.130> worry<00:04:04.340> about<00:04:04.430> it

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:04.730 
you're going to have to worry about it

00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:06.400 
you're going to have to worry about it
that<00:04:04.850> often<00:04:05.000> it's<00:04:05.299> not<00:04:05.360> a<00:04:05.480> 60,000<00:04:06.290> mile

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:06.410

that often it's not a 60,000 mile
interval<00:04:06.799> one<00:04:07.220> of<00:04:07.280> my<00:04:07.340> friends<00:04:07.580> head<00:04:07.700> in<00:04:07.790> a

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:07.850 
interval one of my friends head in a

00:04:07.850 --> 00:04:09.310 
interval one of my friends head in a
veil<00:04:08.030> and<00:04:08.660> had<00:04:08.780> to<00:04:08.870> change<00:04:08.989> it<00:04:09.140> to<00:04:09.200> something

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:09.320 
veil and had to change it to something

00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:10.870 
veil and had to change it to something
billed<00:04:09.590> at<00:04:09.680> 60,000<00:04:10.310> miles<00:04:10.459> I<00:04:10.580> thought<00:04:10.760> that

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:10.880 
billed at 60,000 miles I thought that

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:14.530 
billed at 60,000 miles I thought that
was<00:04:11.030> shitty<00:04:11.440> but<00:04:12.440> again<00:04:13.220> belt<00:04:13.670> driven<00:04:14.060> not

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:14.540 
was shitty but again belt driven not

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:16.330 
was shitty but again belt driven not
chain<00:04:14.959> driven<00:04:15.200> so<00:04:15.500> you<00:04:15.560> do<00:04:15.830> have<00:04:15.860> to<00:04:16.070> change

00:04:16.330 --> 00:04:16.340 
chain driven so you do have to change

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:17.759 
chain driven so you do have to change
this<00:04:16.609> guy

00:04:17.759 --> 00:04:17.769 
this guy

00:04:17.769 --> 00:04:19.650 
this guy
and<00:04:18.250> of<00:04:18.459> course<00:04:18.669> off<00:04:18.880> the<00:04:19.000> top<00:04:19.150> of<00:04:19.180> the<00:04:19.359> engines

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:19.660 
and of course off the top of the engines

00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:22.230 
and of course off the top of the engines
you<00:04:19.780> have<00:04:19.959> your<00:04:20.139> spark<00:04:20.889> plugs<00:04:21.130> or<00:04:21.880> the<00:04:22.030> wires

00:04:22.230 --> 00:04:22.240 
you have your spark plugs or the wires

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:25.920 
you have your spark plugs or the wires
at<00:04:22.569> least<00:04:23.490> just<00:04:24.490> standard<00:04:24.819> stuff<00:04:24.880> nothing<00:04:25.690> too

00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:25.930 
at least just standard stuff nothing too

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:28.170 
at least just standard stuff nothing too
exciting<00:04:26.340> and<00:04:27.340> actually<00:04:28.030> they're<00:04:28.150> pretty

00:04:28.170 --> 00:04:28.180 
exciting and actually they're pretty

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:30.029 
exciting and actually they're pretty
accessible<00:04:28.870> I<00:04:29.110> don't<00:04:29.319> know<00:04:29.410> if<00:04:29.500> you<00:04:29.590> can<00:04:29.740> see

00:04:30.029 --> 00:04:30.039 
accessible I don't know if you can see

00:04:30.039 --> 00:04:32.070 
accessible I don't know if you can see
that<00:04:30.280> probably<00:04:31.060> not<00:04:31.419> because<00:04:31.569> this<00:04:31.750> camera

00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:32.080 
that probably not because this camera

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:34.110 
that probably not because this camera
isn't<00:04:32.199> great<00:04:32.440> but<00:04:33.130> the<00:04:33.550> spark<00:04:33.789> plug<00:04:33.970> is

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:34.120 
isn't great but the spark plug is

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:35.640 
isn't great but the spark plug is
literally<00:04:34.389> I<00:04:34.539> can<00:04:34.810> touch<00:04:34.960> it<00:04:34.990> with<00:04:35.139> my<00:04:35.319> finger

00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:35.650 
literally I can touch it with my finger

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:38.100 
literally I can touch it with my finger
so<00:04:35.849> it's<00:04:36.849> not<00:04:37.150> like<00:04:37.330> with<00:04:37.449> my<00:04:37.599> Civic<00:04:37.930> where<00:04:38.080> I

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:38.110 
so it's not like with my Civic where I

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:40.050 
so it's not like with my Civic where I
used<00:04:38.319> to<00:04:38.410> have<00:04:38.560> to<00:04:38.710> have<00:04:38.889> like<00:04:39.130> an<00:04:39.280> extension

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:40.060 
used to have to have like an extension

00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:43.379 
used to have to have like an extension
of<00:04:40.240> foot<00:04:40.630> long<00:04:40.930> to<00:04:41.440> get<00:04:41.669> the<00:04:42.669> spark<00:04:42.940> plugs<00:04:43.210> out

00:04:43.379 --> 00:04:43.389 
of foot long to get the spark plugs out

00:04:43.389 --> 00:04:45.210 
of foot long to get the spark plugs out
it<00:04:43.569> was<00:04:44.039> ridiculous

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:45.220 
it was ridiculous

00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:46.710 
it was ridiculous
making<00:04:45.490> sure<00:04:45.520> this<00:04:45.849> thing's<00:04:46.150> tight<00:04:46.360> in<00:04:46.509> here

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:46.720 
making sure this thing's tight in here

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:51.059 
making sure this thing's tight in here
it<00:04:47.560> is<00:04:48.599> I'll<00:04:49.599> do<00:04:49.840> those<00:04:50.229> things<00:04:50.590> of<00:04:50.770> course<00:04:50.889> you

00:04:51.059 --> 00:04:51.069 
it is I'll do those things of course you

00:04:51.069 --> 00:04:52.370 
it is I'll do those things of course you
have<00:04:51.190> your<00:04:51.220> positive<00:04:51.699> crankcase<00:04:51.970> ventilation

00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:52.380 
have your positive crankcase ventilation

00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:55.499 
have your positive crankcase ventilation
feeding<00:04:53.380> back<00:04:53.500> into<00:04:53.710> the<00:04:53.919> air<00:04:54.039> intake<00:04:54.509> let's

00:04:55.499 --> 00:04:55.509 
feeding back into the air intake let's

00:04:55.509 --> 00:04:58.050 
feeding back into the air intake let's
go<00:04:55.630> ahead<00:04:55.720> and<00:04:55.900> take<00:04:55.990> a<00:04:56.020> look<00:04:56.259> back<00:04:56.440> here<00:04:57.060> back

00:04:58.050 --> 00:04:58.060 
go ahead and take a look back here back

00:04:58.060 --> 00:05:00.149 
go ahead and take a look back here back
here<00:04:58.389> of<00:04:58.780> course<00:04:59.020> this<00:04:59.169> big<00:04:59.319> ol<00:04:59.530> silver<00:04:59.949> thing

00:05:00.149 --> 00:05:00.159 
here of course this big ol silver thing

00:05:00.159 --> 00:05:03.420 
here of course this big ol silver thing
and<00:05:00.490> your<00:05:00.659> view<00:05:01.659> is<00:05:01.960> the<00:05:02.349> exhaust<00:05:02.830> manifold

00:05:03.420 --> 00:05:03.430 
and your view is the exhaust manifold

00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:05.610 
and your view is the exhaust manifold
that<00:05:04.000> runs<00:05:04.240> down<00:05:04.449> to<00:05:04.509> the<00:05:04.780> muffler<00:05:05.050> which<00:05:05.319> is

00:05:05.610 --> 00:05:05.620 
that runs down to the muffler which is

00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:08.460 
that runs down to the muffler which is
back<00:05:06.580> there<00:05:07.060> and<00:05:07.659> this<00:05:07.810> white<00:05:08.050> thing<00:05:08.080> that's

00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:08.470 
back there and this white thing that's

00:05:08.470 --> 00:05:10.350 
back there and this white thing that's
in<00:05:08.590> the<00:05:08.680> way<00:05:08.800> is<00:05:08.860> an<00:05:09.039> oxygen<00:05:09.430> sensor<00:05:09.940> there's

00:05:10.350 --> 00:05:10.360 
in the way is an oxygen sensor there's

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:12.149 
in the way is an oxygen sensor there's
also<00:05:10.509> another<00:05:10.690> oxygen<00:05:11.409> sensor<00:05:11.740> right<00:05:11.919> there

00:05:12.149 --> 00:05:12.159 
also another oxygen sensor right there

00:05:12.159 --> 00:05:14.100 
also another oxygen sensor right there
with<00:05:12.400> the<00:05:12.490> orange<00:05:12.729> cord<00:05:13.210> attached<00:05:13.479> to<00:05:13.780> it<00:05:13.930> I

00:05:14.100 --> 00:05:14.110 
with the orange cord attached to it I

00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:15.689 
with the orange cord attached to it I
don't<00:05:14.800> know<00:05:14.889> if<00:05:14.949> there's<00:05:15.099> any<00:05:15.220> more<00:05:15.430> than<00:05:15.580> that

00:05:15.689 --> 00:05:15.699 
don't know if there's any more than that

00:05:15.699 --> 00:05:17.700 
don't know if there's any more than that
there<00:05:15.849> might<00:05:16.030> be<00:05:16.060> this<00:05:16.900> little<00:05:17.139> silver<00:05:17.380> bar

00:05:17.700 --> 00:05:17.710 
there might be this little silver bar

00:05:17.710 --> 00:05:20.339 
there might be this little silver bar
running<00:05:18.099> here<00:05:18.370> that<00:05:19.240> is<00:05:19.509> the<00:05:19.720> part<00:05:19.960> of<00:05:20.139> the

00:05:20.339 --> 00:05:20.349 
running here that is the part of the

00:05:20.349 --> 00:05:22.080 
running here that is the part of the
steering<00:05:20.710> system<00:05:20.979> that<00:05:21.400> is<00:05:21.550> actually<00:05:21.880> at<00:05:22.000> the

00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:22.090 
steering system that is actually at the

00:05:22.090 --> 00:05:25.680 
steering system that is actually at the
half<00:05:22.270> shaft<00:05:22.599> or<00:05:23.039> CV<00:05:24.039> shaft<00:05:24.520> or<00:05:24.880> axle<00:05:25.210> shaft<00:05:25.449> or

half shaft or CV shaft or axle shaft or
whatever<00:05:25.960> the<00:05:26.110> hell<00:05:26.229> you<00:05:26.349> want<00:05:26.530> to<00:05:26.560> call<00:05:26.740> it

00:05:26.909 --> 00:05:26.919 
whatever the hell you want to call it

00:05:26.919 --> 00:05:28.860 
whatever the hell you want to call it
connects<00:05:27.759> to<00:05:27.849> the<00:05:28.000> wheel<00:05:28.180> and<00:05:28.509> that's<00:05:28.599> how<00:05:28.810> you

00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:28.870 
connects to the wheel and that's how you

00:05:28.870 --> 00:05:31.290 
connects to the wheel and that's how you
steer<00:05:29.169> your<00:05:29.199> vehicle<00:05:29.710> you<00:05:30.130> can<00:05:30.280> see<00:05:30.310> it<00:05:30.610> going

00:05:31.290 --> 00:05:31.300 
steer your vehicle you can see it going

00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:33.089 
steer your vehicle you can see it going
to<00:05:31.509> the<00:05:31.599> other<00:05:31.719> side<00:05:31.990> over<00:05:32.199> here<00:05:32.229> and<00:05:32.830> you<00:05:32.949> can

00:05:33.089 --> 00:05:33.099 
to the other side over here and you can

00:05:33.099 --> 00:05:35.159 
to the other side over here and you can
see<00:05:33.310> it<00:05:33.430> going<00:05:34.150> to<00:05:34.300> this<00:05:34.630> side<00:05:34.870> over<00:05:35.050> here

00:05:35.159 --> 00:05:35.169 
see it going to this side over here

00:05:35.169 --> 00:05:40.469 
see it going to this side over here
where<00:05:36.130> the<00:05:36.219> boots<00:05:36.430> are<00:05:39.150> just<00:05:40.150> kind<00:05:40.330> of<00:05:40.360> an

00:05:40.469 --> 00:05:40.479 
where the boots are just kind of an

00:05:40.479 --> 00:05:41.700 
where the boots are just kind of an
interesting<00:05:40.750> thing<00:05:41.110> you<00:05:41.289> can<00:05:41.440> see<00:05:41.590> the

00:05:41.700 --> 00:05:41.710 
interesting thing you can see the

00:05:41.710 --> 00:05:42.990 
interesting thing you can see the
steering<00:05:41.949> system<00:05:42.219> I<00:05:42.490> don't<00:05:42.639> know<00:05:42.729> if<00:05:42.789> you<00:05:42.849> can

00:05:42.990 --> 00:05:43.000 
steering system I don't know if you can

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:45.089 
steering system I don't know if you can
see<00:05:43.180> this<00:05:43.330> well<00:05:43.539> right<00:05:43.750> there<00:05:43.960> that's<00:05:44.770> coming

00:05:45.089 --> 00:05:45.099 
see this well right there that's coming

00:05:45.099 --> 00:05:47.459 
see this well right there that's coming
from<00:05:45.639> the<00:05:45.820> column<00:05:46.240> and<00:05:46.599> going<00:05:46.990> straight<00:05:47.259> down

00:05:47.459 --> 00:05:47.469 
from the column and going straight down

00:05:47.469 --> 00:05:48.990 
from the column and going straight down
there<00:05:47.710> I<00:05:47.740> guess<00:05:47.979> that's<00:05:48.159> where<00:05:48.580> the<00:05:48.669> electric

00:05:48.990 --> 00:05:49.000 
there I guess that's where the electric

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:50.600 
there I guess that's where the electric
power<00:05:49.180> steering<00:05:49.419> is<00:05:49.690> housed

00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:50.610 
power steering is housed

00:05:50.610 --> 00:05:52.680 
power steering is housed
other<00:05:51.610> than<00:05:51.819> that<00:05:51.909> you<00:05:52.210> have<00:05:52.360> your<00:05:52.479> manual

00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:52.690 
other than that you have your manual

00:05:52.690 --> 00:05:54.600 
other than that you have your manual
transmission<00:05:53.440> with<00:05:53.620> bar<00:05:53.889> code<00:05:54.130> on<00:05:54.340> it<00:05:54.370> right

00:05:54.600 --> 00:05:54.610 
transmission with bar code on it right

00:05:54.610 --> 00:05:56.339 
transmission with bar code on it right
there<00:05:54.639> that<00:05:55.569> really<00:05:55.780> tells<00:05:55.990> you<00:05:56.139> anything

00:05:56.339 --> 00:05:56.349 
there that really tells you anything

00:05:56.349 --> 00:05:59.370 
there that really tells you anything
that<00:05:56.849> actually<00:05:57.849> is<00:05:57.940> the<00:05:57.969> IB<00:05:58.419> v<00:05:58.690> transmission

00:05:59.370 --> 00:05:59.380 
that actually is the IB v transmission

00:05:59.380 --> 00:06:01.129 
that actually is the IB v transmission
or<00:05:59.530> version<00:05:59.919> of<00:06:00.009> it<00:06:00.130> that's<00:06:00.280> been<00:06:00.400> used<00:06:00.759> since

00:06:01.129 --> 00:06:01.139 
or version of it that's been used since

00:06:01.139 --> 00:06:03.480 
or version of it that's been used since
1976<00:06:02.139> but<00:06:02.349> of<00:06:02.469> course<00:06:02.650> heavily<00:06:03.099> revised

00:06:03.480 --> 00:06:03.490 
1976 but of course heavily revised

00:06:03.490 --> 00:06:05.399 
1976 but of course heavily revised
personally<00:06:04.300> wouldn't<00:06:04.479> use<00:06:04.599> the<00:06:04.780> same<00:06:04.960> thing

00:06:05.399 --> 00:06:05.409 
personally wouldn't use the same thing

00:06:05.409 --> 00:06:07.200 
personally wouldn't use the same thing
all<00:06:05.800> these<00:06:06.130> years<00:06:06.400> and<00:06:06.580> of<00:06:06.669> course<00:06:06.849> this<00:06:07.030> is

00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:07.210 
all these years and of course this is

00:06:07.210 --> 00:06:10.589 
all these years and of course this is
the<00:06:07.240> Ford<00:06:07.719> I<00:06:07.870> think<00:06:08.710> it's<00:06:08.830> Sigma<00:06:09.250> or<00:06:10.030> was<00:06:10.360> the

00:06:10.589 --> 00:06:10.599 
the Ford I think it's Sigma or was the

00:06:10.599 --> 00:06:12.749 
the Ford I think it's Sigma or was the
Ford<00:06:10.840> Sigma<00:06:11.229> I<00:06:11.440> believe<00:06:12.250> and<00:06:12.490> now<00:06:12.610> it's

00:06:12.749 --> 00:06:12.759 
Ford Sigma I believe and now it's

00:06:12.759 --> 00:06:16.320 
Ford Sigma I believe and now it's
duratec<00:06:13.240> of<00:06:13.389> course<00:06:13.630> ti-vct<00:06:14.050> whatever<00:06:15.330> you

00:06:16.320 --> 00:06:16.330 
duratec of course ti-vct whatever you

00:06:16.330 --> 00:06:18.390 
duratec of course ti-vct whatever you
can<00:06:16.539> see<00:06:16.719> your<00:06:16.900> motor<00:06:17.289> craft<00:06:17.620> oil<00:06:17.979> filter

00:06:18.390 --> 00:06:18.400 
can see your motor craft oil filter

00:06:18.400 --> 00:06:21.120 
can see your motor craft oil filter
sticking<00:06:19.270> out<00:06:19.389> the<00:06:19.509> front<00:06:19.810> which<00:06:20.770> I<00:06:20.919> think

00:06:21.120 --> 00:06:21.130 
sticking out the front which I think

00:06:21.130 --> 00:06:22.439 
sticking out the front which I think
that's<00:06:21.250> a<00:06:21.310> great<00:06:21.460> spot<00:06:21.819> because<00:06:21.849> if<00:06:22.240> you<00:06:22.360> get

00:06:22.439 --> 00:06:22.449 
that's a great spot because if you get

00:06:22.449 --> 00:06:25.020 
that's a great spot because if you get
up<00:06:22.599> underneath<00:06:22.840> the<00:06:23.110> car<00:06:23.729> like<00:06:24.729> you're<00:06:24.880> going

00:06:25.020 --> 00:06:25.030 
up underneath the car like you're going

00:06:25.030 --> 00:06:26.779 
up underneath the car like you're going
to<00:06:25.090> go<00:06:25.180> change<00:06:25.449> of<00:06:25.569> the<00:06:25.630> oil

00:06:26.779 --> 00:06:26.789 
to go change of the oil

00:06:26.789 --> 00:06:33.260 
to go change of the oil
your<00:06:27.389> oil<00:06:27.419> filter<00:06:27.779> is<00:06:30.050> right<00:06:31.050> there<00:06:32.039> so<00:06:33.029> she's

00:06:33.260 --> 00:06:33.270 
your oil filter is right there so she's

00:06:33.270 --> 00:06:37.339 
your oil filter is right there so she's
easy<00:06:33.479> to<00:06:33.599> get<00:06:33.839> to<00:06:35.270> and<00:06:36.270> just<00:06:36.779> kind<00:06:36.960> of<00:06:37.050> a<00:06:37.139> look

00:06:37.339 --> 00:06:37.349 
easy to get to and just kind of a look

00:06:37.349 --> 00:06:41.899 
easy to get to and just kind of a look
underneath<00:06:37.620> here<00:06:39.499> how<00:06:40.499> exciting<00:06:41.159> and<00:06:41.759> it

00:06:41.899 --> 00:06:41.909 
underneath here how exciting and it

00:06:41.909 --> 00:06:43.579 
underneath here how exciting and it
looks<00:06:42.059> like<00:06:42.150> it<00:06:42.449> so<00:06:42.599> your<00:06:42.749> oil<00:06:42.990> pan<00:06:43.349> right

00:06:43.579 --> 00:06:43.589 
looks like it so your oil pan right

00:06:43.589 --> 00:06:48.049 
looks like it so your oil pan right
there<00:06:45.949> it's<00:06:46.949> so<00:06:47.129> different<00:06:47.370> under<00:06:47.699> here<00:06:47.879> from

00:06:48.049 --> 00:06:48.059 
there it's so different under here from

00:06:48.059 --> 00:06:50.989 
there it's so different under here from
Hondas<00:06:48.449> and<00:06:48.919> of<00:06:49.919> course<00:06:50.099> back<00:06:50.520> there<00:06:50.729> is<00:06:50.879> your

00:06:50.989 --> 00:06:50.999 
Hondas and of course back there is your

00:06:50.999 --> 00:06:52.429 
Hondas and of course back there is your
rear<00:06:51.180> main<00:06:51.360> seal<00:06:51.389> with<00:06:51.719> the<00:06:51.809> transmission<00:06:52.229> and

00:06:52.429 --> 00:06:52.439 
rear main seal with the transmission and

00:06:52.439 --> 00:06:58.159 
rear main seal with the transmission and
engine<00:06:52.559> come<00:06:52.889> together<00:06:53.039> oh<00:06:57.020> that<00:06:58.020> was

00:06:58.159 --> 00:06:58.169 
engine come together oh that was

00:06:58.169 --> 00:07:00.950 
engine come together oh that was
interesting<00:06:58.620> well<00:06:59.279> other<00:06:59.580> than<00:06:59.819> that<00:07:00.029> I<00:07:00.300> think

00:07:00.950 --> 00:07:00.960 
interesting well other than that I think

00:07:00.960 --> 00:07:02.510 
interesting well other than that I think
this<00:07:01.169> has<00:07:01.259> been<00:07:01.289> a<00:07:01.439> bit<00:07:01.710> of<00:07:01.830> a<00:07:01.889> better<00:07:02.069> video<00:07:02.370> if

00:07:02.510 --> 00:07:02.520 
this has been a bit of a better video if
