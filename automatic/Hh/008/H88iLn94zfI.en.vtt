00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:12.420 
quickly take a look at the case ology

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:14.180 
quickly take a look at the case ology
cases<00:00:12.840> here<00:00:13.049> for<00:00:13.200> the<00:00:13.259> galaxy<00:00:13.590> s6<00:00:13.950> and<00:00:14.130> galaxy

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:14.190 
cases here for the galaxy s6 and galaxy

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:16.670 
cases here for the galaxy s6 and galaxy
s6<00:00:14.940> edge<00:00:15.210> these<00:00:15.509> are<00:00:15.630> not<00:00:15.780> the<00:00:15.900> only<00:00:15.929> designs

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:16.680 
s6 edge these are not the only designs

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:18.859 
s6 edge these are not the only designs
that<00:00:17.430> case<00:00:17.640> ology<00:00:18.060> has<00:00:18.240> these<00:00:18.510> are<00:00:18.630> just<00:00:18.750> the

00:00:18.859 --> 00:00:18.869 
that case ology has these are just the

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:20.900 
that case ology has these are just the
designs<00:00:19.289> that<00:00:19.470> they<00:00:19.619> sent<00:00:19.890> to<00:00:20.550> me<00:00:20.670> so<00:00:20.789> we'll

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:20.910 
designs that they sent to me so we'll

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:22.849 
designs that they sent to me so we'll
get<00:00:20.970> started<00:00:21.150> with<00:00:21.390> the<00:00:21.449> s6<00:00:21.960> edge<00:00:22.170> cases<00:00:22.619> we'll

00:00:22.849 --> 00:00:22.859 
get started with the s6 edge cases we'll

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:23.900 
get started with the s6 edge cases we'll
go<00:00:22.920> ahead<00:00:22.980> and<00:00:23.130> take<00:00:23.220> these<00:00:23.400> out<00:00:23.550> of<00:00:23.670> the<00:00:23.730> box

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:23.910 
go ahead and take these out of the box

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:25.550 
go ahead and take these out of the box
now<00:00:24.720> it<00:00:24.779> looks<00:00:24.840> like<00:00:25.019> these<00:00:25.140> are<00:00:25.289> all<00:00:25.380> pretty

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:25.560 
now it looks like these are all pretty

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:27.439 
now it looks like these are all pretty
much<00:00:25.680> the<00:00:25.800> same<00:00:25.949> form<00:00:26.490> factor<00:00:26.550> a<00:00:26.820> TPU<00:00:27.180> case

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:27.449 
much the same form factor a TPU case

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:31.519 
much the same form factor a TPU case
with<00:00:27.630> a<00:00:27.689> hard<00:00:27.869> shell<00:00:28.170> and<00:00:30.170> they<00:00:31.170> just<00:00:31.349> have

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:31.529 
with a hard shell and they just have

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:34.220 
with a hard shell and they just have
kind<00:00:31.740> of<00:00:31.890> different<00:00:32.340> designs<00:00:32.940> okay<00:00:33.870> so<00:00:34.050> you

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:34.230 
kind of different designs okay so you

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:37.790 
kind of different designs okay so you
can<00:00:34.350> see<00:00:34.500> the<00:00:34.649> TPU<00:00:35.510> case<00:00:36.510> with<00:00:37.320> a<00:00:37.350> hard<00:00:37.590> shell

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:37.800 
can see the TPU case with a hard shell

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:39.950 
can see the TPU case with a hard shell
on<00:00:37.950> the<00:00:38.010> outside<00:00:38.070> here<00:00:38.640> this<00:00:38.850> one<00:00:39.000> is<00:00:39.149> a<00:00:39.329> navy

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900 
nice camera hole there on the back so

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:08.060 
nice camera hole there on the back so
what<00:01:07.020> kind<00:01:07.170> of<00:01:07.200> set<00:01:07.380> that<00:01:07.500> to<00:01:07.619> the<00:01:07.680> side<00:01:07.770> I'll

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
what kind of set that to the side I'll

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:09.230 
what kind of set that to the side I'll
go<00:01:08.189> ahead<00:01:08.250> and<00:01:08.340> open<00:01:08.490> up<00:01:08.729> the<00:01:08.790> rest<00:01:09.030> of<00:01:09.150> these

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240 
go ahead and open up the rest of these

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:11.390 
go ahead and open up the rest of these
cases<00:01:09.510> the<00:01:10.049> design<00:01:10.320> is<00:01:10.500> basically<00:01:10.979> the<00:01:11.130> same

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
cases the design is basically the same

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:14.469 
cases the design is basically the same
for<00:01:12.299> all<00:01:12.510> of<00:01:12.689> the<00:01:12.780> cases<00:01:12.960> that<00:01:13.170> I<00:01:13.619> was<00:01:13.830> sent

00:01:14.469 --> 00:01:14.479 
for all of the cases that I was sent

00:01:14.479 --> 00:01:17.600 
for all of the cases that I was sent
pretty<00:01:15.479> much<00:01:15.630> just<00:01:15.810> had<00:01:15.990> that<00:01:16.140> TPU<00:01:16.740> with<00:01:17.580> a

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
pretty much just had that TPU with a

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:20.120 
pretty much just had that TPU with a
hard<00:01:17.820> plastic<00:01:18.060> shell<00:01:18.619> now<00:01:19.619> these<00:01:19.740> are<00:01:19.920> very

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
hard plastic shell now these are very

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:22.219 
hard plastic shell now these are very
lightweight<00:01:20.820> cases<00:01:21.630> so<00:01:21.810> i<00:01:21.869> wouldn't<00:01:22.170> expect

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:22.229 
lightweight cases so i wouldn't expect

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:24.350 
lightweight cases so i wouldn't expect
just<00:01:22.710> a<00:01:22.799> ton<00:01:23.040> of<00:01:23.070> impact<00:01:23.580> resistance<00:01:24.210> with

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
just a ton of impact resistance with

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:25.940 
just a ton of impact resistance with
these<00:01:24.509> cases<00:01:24.900> these<00:01:25.049> are<00:01:25.200> more<00:01:25.380> for<00:01:25.590> style

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
these cases these are more for style

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:28.399 
these cases these are more for style
just<00:01:26.909> to<00:01:27.000> give<00:01:27.150> your<00:01:27.270> phone<00:01:27.450> a<00:01:27.659> nice<00:01:27.900> look<00:01:28.259> and

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:28.409 
just to give your phone a nice look and

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:30.410 
just to give your phone a nice look and
then<00:01:28.530> it's<00:01:28.650> also<00:01:28.860> going<00:01:29.070> to<00:01:29.130> help<00:01:29.220> to<00:01:29.520> reduce

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
then it's also going to help to reduce

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:34.010

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:57.450 
the galaxy s6 case okay and then the

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:01.340 
the galaxy s6 case okay and then the
final<00:01:57.659> case<00:01:58.520> is<00:01:59.520> a<00:02:00.210> little<00:02:00.630> different<00:02:00.990> from

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:01.350 
final case is a little different from

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:04.069 
final case is a little different from
the<00:02:01.560> rest<00:02:01.740> it's<00:02:02.040> still<00:02:02.250> a<00:02:02.280> TPU<00:02:02.759> case<00:02:03.119> on<00:02:03.960> the

the rest it's still a TPU case on the

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:06.020 
the rest it's still a TPU case on the
inside<00:02:04.409> but<00:02:04.560> it<00:02:04.680> has<00:02:04.829> like<00:02:05.009> this<00:02:05.159> leather<00:02:05.670> faux

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:06.030

leather<00:02:06.299> feel<00:02:06.659> on<00:02:06.930> the<00:02:07.020> outside<00:02:07.520> which<00:02:08.520> is

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:08.670 
leather feel on the outside which is

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:10.219 
leather feel on the outside which is
really<00:02:08.849> nice<00:02:09.030> I<00:02:09.270> kind<00:02:09.450> of<00:02:09.479> like<00:02:09.629> that<00:02:09.660> quite<00:02:10.200> a

really nice I kind of like that quite a

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:12.710 
really nice I kind of like that quite a
bit<00:02:10.349> and<00:02:10.649> then<00:02:11.160> you<00:02:11.280> have<00:02:11.489> of<00:02:12.300> course<00:02:12.510> the

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:12.720 
bit and then you have of course the

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:13.640 
bit and then you have of course the
harder<00:02:13.080> fly

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:13.650 
harder fly

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:17.720

stick<00:02:13.920> around<00:02:14.069> the<00:02:14.400> edges<00:02:16.189> to<00:02:17.189> give<00:02:17.340> it<00:02:17.489> just<00:02:17.640> a

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:17.730 
stick around the edges to give it just a

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:19.670 
stick around the edges to give it just a
little<00:02:17.939> more<00:02:18.060> rigidity<00:02:18.510> and<00:02:18.750> durability<00:02:19.319> so

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:19.680 
little more rigidity and durability so

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:21.500 
little more rigidity and durability so
go<00:02:19.769> ahead<00:02:19.860> and<00:02:20.099> insert<00:02:20.519> the<00:02:20.819> phone<00:02:21.060> into<00:02:21.390> these

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:21.510 
go ahead and insert the phone into these

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:22.940 
go ahead and insert the phone into these
cases<00:02:21.930> and<00:02:22.049> see<00:02:22.230> what<00:02:22.349> they<00:02:22.439> look<00:02:22.470> like<00:02:22.620> we'll

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:22.950

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:27.979 
cases and see what they look like we'll
get<00:02:23.069> started<00:02:23.280> with<00:02:23.549> the<00:02:23.670> s6<00:02:24.269> edge<00:02:26.810> so<00:02:27.810> you<00:02:27.870> guys

00:02:27.979 --> 00:02:27.989 
get started with the s6 edge so you guys

00:02:27.989 --> 00:02:34.789 
get started with the s6 edge so you guys
can<00:02:28.170> see<00:02:28.379> what<00:02:28.530> that<00:02:28.650> looks<00:02:28.709> like<00:02:33.530> it's<00:02:34.530> nice
