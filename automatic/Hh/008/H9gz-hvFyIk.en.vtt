00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:03.600
 what do you think guys who can boast about touching 6 million 

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:07.240
 of individuals everywhere the big TV channels are camping women presenting 

00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:08.580
 internet tea obviously 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:13.100
 messi scored another the metro metro the subway it's thanks to the 

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:13.860
 sale of tickets 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:17.650
 but know that it exceeded even more expensive entry ticket 

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:23.140
 well, because the advertising brings to the ratp a whopping 70 million 

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:24.589
 euros is not it 

00:00:24.589 --> 00:00:27.919
 but the subway call has changed since the time of the 

00:00:27.919 --> 00:00:30.060
 good bondues and in the tunnels 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:33.220
 so today are interactive electronic panels 

00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:36.180
 saw the events only the undressing station 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:39.410
 route de rabat the Paris metro with the largest number of stations 

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:44.360
 anderson became a huge business very lucrative and franÃ§ois salque to 12 

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:48.270
 years take behind the scenes of this underground machine did we learn 

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:08.180
 m this country's rainwater 

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:19.280
 a few meters underground there is an advertising medium to make it the 

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:20.530
 Paris subway 

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:23.780
 to be a paradise for advertisers who share more than fifty thousand 

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:26.440
 times more beautiful from there the staircase title 

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:29.780
 at the big-tube metro passing of course by the fifa fear 3 

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:33.470
 this format was also invented in the metro and then taken over by 

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:34.890
 all outdoor displays 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:38.180
 like what in terms of pub the subway has always had an advanced train 

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:41.720
 since the creation of the metro in 1900 

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:43.930
 very quickly spaces 

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:45.680
 after this passage 

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:48.680
 we had in a process preventive detention 

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:52.700
 there were a lot of places today in green Morocco to that at 

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:55.460
 otherwise have pitches 

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:58.680
 valuing for us maintain more attractive 

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:01.360
 and then advertising has become an art and a profession 

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:04.660
 if the metrobus control and who took control of the network in the 50s 

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:08.410
 it responds to advertisers' requests and offers walking routes 

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:09.279
 specific 

00:02:09.279 --> 00:02:12.279
 to reach only a part of the 6 million daily passengers 

00:02:12.859 --> 00:02:16.539
 we have noticed tv moral reasons that can reach young targets 

00:02:16.539 --> 00:02:19.409
 more prestigious targets 

00:02:19.409 --> 00:02:22.699
 network for its 200 advertising spaces scattered throughout the 

00:02:22.699 --> 00:02:25.099
 most popular resorts in the capital 

00:02:25.099 --> 00:02:28.180
 and if you want to give yourself an entire station like nespresso to 

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:32.109
 caumartin is possible but as monopoly all addresses are not 

00:02:32.109 --> 00:02:33.369
 at the same price 

00:02:33.369 --> 00:02:36.810
 the addresses account we are not going to the scene happened 

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:40.329
 amelie mauresmo confrontation as before when martin will send for women 

00:02:41.379 --> 00:02:44.670
 she is on the axes that are also very much in demand 

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:47.999
 in the long run China counts if csp + 5 

00:02:47.999 --> 00:02:51.000
 difficult to cross not less than one hundred thousand euros 

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.000
 to display his coffee for 15 minutes 

00:02:55.249 --> 00:02:58.809
 and to get off the beaten track of classic advertising advertisers 

00:02:58.809 --> 00:03:00.829
 can also create the event in the subway 

00:03:00.829 --> 00:03:04.419
 after 30 years of preparing dickey artists to the big five 

00:03:04.419 --> 00:03:08.189
 Parisian resorts by replacing the country erasm seats because she was 

00:03:08.189 --> 00:03:09.859
 on discount 

00:03:09.859 --> 00:03:12.859
 cost of the operation 200 million 

00:03:15.169 --> 00:03:19.209
 since 1998 the event is really developing 

00:03:19.209 --> 00:03:22.819
 this goes from the small operation led to the stick to promote come 

00:03:22.819 --> 00:03:23.569
 in music 

00:03:23.569 --> 00:03:26.649
 to the big device with the development of ghost stations 

00:03:28.149 --> 00:03:31.759
 originally installed in March 2010 qashqai cars in a station 

00:03:31.759 --> 00:03:33.299
 closed to the public 

00:03:33.299 --> 00:03:36.359
 and that's how the ratp in pocket over 500 million 

00:03:37.389 --> 00:03:40.409
 the inventor of the basin some advertisers have adopted another technique 

00:03:40.909 --> 00:03:42.589
 much less expensive 

00:03:42.589 --> 00:03:44.399
 some German actors 

00:03:44.399 --> 00:03:49.969
 we understand perfectly the game which is to propose campaigns whose 

00:03:49.969 --> 00:03:53.559
 they know very well that they will not be accepted so that they can then scream 

00:03:53.559 --> 00:03:56.769
 to censorship and make a media buzz around that 

00:03:56.769 --> 00:03:57.869
 good be 

00:03:57.869 --> 00:04:02.029
 we live with but yes in the subway we can not touch the Vatican of the 

00:04:02.029 --> 00:04:03.319
 religion in general 

00:04:03.319 --> 00:04:05.409
 make the woman a simple commodity 

00:04:05.409 --> 00:04:09.799
 or even turned farmers on the issue of GMOs but why so much 

00:04:09.799 --> 00:04:12.279
 of restrictions we see it every person 

00:04:12.279 --> 00:04:13.350
 because m 

00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:17.380
 the metro is taken by everyone by children of 4 years as by 

00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:18.749
 the elderly 

00:04:18.749 --> 00:04:23.099
 even by Catholics as the way of Muslims by people of the left 

00:04:23.099 --> 00:04:26.879
 as by right people by farmers when they come to paris 

00:04:29.509 --> 00:04:31.379
 environmental advocates 

00:04:31.379 --> 00:04:33.840
 a principle that sometimes leads to excessive zeal 

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:37.629
 the missive the character of sir bureau was clearly denatured 

00:04:37.629 --> 00:04:40.629
 same as July 25 the ridiculous precaution 

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:44.520
 another controversy the establishment of 400 digital panels that allow 

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:47.520
 to adapt the advertisement according to the times of the day 

00:04:48.039 --> 00:04:51.419
 metobus wanted to integrate sensors to analyze their audience 

00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:55.430
 initially the sensor that would have if we want to install license from 

00:04:55.430 --> 00:04:56.469
 accounting 

00:04:56.469 --> 00:04:59.559
 the number of passes and the time spent in front of 

00:05:00.569 --> 00:05:04.680
 and this tool of the future a little earlier was badly received 

00:05:04.679 --> 00:05:06.849
 very big controversy with anti ads 

00:05:06.849 --> 00:05:07.880
 essentially 

00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:10.880
 for those who have thought about 6 kg laying of 

00:05:11.979 --> 00:05:15.419
 it was her day for her with the video cameras of works of art 

00:05:15.419 --> 00:05:18.680
 and yes the entities often go for habit of going down in the subway 

00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:20.599
 to raise their anger 

00:05:20.599 --> 00:05:23.839
 forty digital panels were degraded I returned to mali 

00:05:23.839 --> 00:05:26.839
 today the sensor project that is on stand-by 

00:05:27.699 --> 00:05:30.879
 midday relations between players are also the main problem at 

00:05:30.879 --> 00:05:34.090
 manage for metro bus because the bill amounts each year to several 

00:05:34.090 --> 00:05:35.479
 hundreds of thousands of euros 

00:05:35.479 --> 00:05:38.479
 that's why the defense of the poorest has become a major issue 

00:05:39.159 --> 00:05:41.400
 investors were sensitive than others 

00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:44.309
 the station will be there 

00:05:44.309 --> 00:05:46.759
 the convoy 

00:05:46.759 --> 00:05:49.180
 it's really a big day for me dear 

00:05:49.180 --> 00:05:53.330
 to talk about it on a daily basis it's also the culture that took place 

00:05:53.330 --> 00:05:54.689
 protect posters 

00:05:54.689 --> 00:05:56.460
 is this not 

00:05:56.460 --> 00:05:58.539
 but of pub culture 

00:05:58.539 --> 00:05:59.610
 party is worn 

00:05:59.610 --> 00:06:00.449
 in this tournament 

00:06:00.449 --> 00:06:02.759
 what happened 

00:06:02.759 --> 00:06:04.530
 Francois Hollande 

00:06:04.530 --> 00:06:08.070
 he will have to show what you talk about our society and apparently 

00:06:08.070 --> 00:06:11.970
 for now chose the best of the temple guards the socialist party has 

00:06:11.970 --> 00:06:13.169
 did the right thing 

00:06:13.169 --> 00:06:15.080
 al seni 

00:06:15.080 --> 00:06:16.250
 what its output 

00:06:16.250 --> 00:06:19.920
 this decision is unfair because it's done
