and if you're a beginner and you figure
out<00:02:11.680> what<00:02:12.160> is<00:02:12.310> better<00:02:12.520> and<00:02:12.930> some<00:02:13.930> songs

00:02:15.199 --> 00:02:15.209 
out what is better and some songs

00:02:15.209 --> 00:02:18.030 
out what is better and some songs
actually<00:02:16.209> sounds<00:02:17.200> better<00:02:17.230> with<00:02:17.650> the<00:02:17.800> pit

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:18.040 
actually sounds better with the pit

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:19.890 
actually sounds better with the pit
because<00:02:18.360> sometimes<00:02:19.360> when<00:02:19.510> you're<00:02:19.690> playing

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:19.900

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:43.290 

might<00:02:40.690> be<00:02:40.840> easier<00:02:41.440> to<00:02:41.500> play<00:02:41.800> on<00:02:42.130> play<00:02:43.120> with

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:43.300
