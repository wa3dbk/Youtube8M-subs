00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:44.430 
the co which is about acura form I think

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:48.890 
the co which is about acura form I think
2k<00:02:44.790> gave<00:02:45.150> really<00:02:45.780> good<00:02:46.170> stats<00:02:46.880> because<00:02:47.880> I<00:02:48.330> mean

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:48.900 
2k gave really good stats because I mean

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:51.260 
2k gave really good stats because I mean
he's<00:02:49.110> not<00:02:49.290> overpowering<00:02:49.860> like<00:02:50.730> overpowering

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:51.270 
he's not overpowering like overpowering

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:54.620 
he's not overpowering like overpowering
good<00:02:52.050> but<00:02:52.890> he<00:02:53.070> just<00:02:53.190> like<00:02:53.670> nine<00:02:54.030> an<00:02:54.180> overall

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:54.630 
good but he just like nine an overall

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:57.020 
good but he just like nine an overall
like<00:02:54.810> barely<00:02:55.110> 99<00:02:55.620> I<00:02:55.860> believe<00:02:56.370> lebron<00:02:56.550> stats

00:02:57.020 --> 00:02:57.030 
like barely 99 I believe lebron stats

00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:59.210 
like barely 99 I believe lebron stats
are<00:02:57.210> better<00:02:57.480> than<00:02:57.720> Michael<00:02:58.080> Jordan's<00:02:58.470> bull

00:02:59.210 --> 00:02:59.220 
are better than Michael Jordan's bull

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:01.310 
are better than Michael Jordan's bull
fight<00:02:59.400> or<00:02:59.610> 99<00:02:59.970> which<00:03:00.270> I<00:03:00.390> feel<00:03:00.570> is<00:03:00.630> unfair<00:03:01.170> for

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:01.320

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:02.690 
fight or 99 which I feel is unfair for
Michael<00:03:01.650> because<00:03:01.860> Michael<00:03:01.890> is<00:03:02.340> the<00:03:02.490> greatest

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:02.700
