00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.529
 hello my name is his nikitin and in 

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:07.710
 I want to touch on this very important video. 

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:10.410
 topic is very relevant this topic creation 

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:14.250
 materials look here at these projects 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:16.830
 to visualize what you see here on 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:19.439
 every object in these all interiors 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:22.260
 there is naturally material with her 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:25.289
 properties with textures with reflections with 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:27.750
 some kind of blurred relief 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:29.160
 or clear tickets and so on for 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:31.439
 this need to apply a lot 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:34.530
 parameters to create these materials 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:38.010
 these are different values ​​and different textures 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:40.070
 and inside the texture its properties too 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:43.440
 the result should get a good result 

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:45.570
 Now imagine what would happen if 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:47.670
 instead of quality materials here in 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:51.149
 these several projects are represented 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:53.760
 Canada on the screen what if all 

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:55.670
 these materials have been configured wrong 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:58.440
 good and were just average quality 

00:00:55.670 --> 00:01:01.050
 medium quality textures and regular 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:04.769
 as if made no problems in an ambulance 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:06.689
 arm and so on for 10 years working with 3d 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:09.030
 I've seen a lot of graphics 

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:11.460
 projects and naturally early career 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:14.310
 sanctions solved a bunch of mistakes and believe me 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:16.619
 my experience without well-developed 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:18.659
 materials and textures any absolutely 

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:21.360
 project whatever it is good with 

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:23.460
 in terms of design and architecture any 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:25.450
 a project without good materials becomes 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:27.850
 very boring and not 

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:30.219
 teres on visualization with such 

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:33.759
 mediocre materials will not save already 

00:01:30.219 --> 00:01:36.310
 almost nothing light is not good 

00:01:33.759 --> 00:01:38.770
 the models are even more so there are parameters 

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:40.929
 render or angles and here is the exit to 

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:43.270
 actually one work on each 

00:01:40.929 --> 00:01:46.479
 an object to watch what material should 

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:47.890
 get brothers for the sample because 

00:01:46.479 --> 00:01:50.259
 real world from photography and 

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:52.270
 customize realistic materials for 

00:01:50.259 --> 00:01:53.069
 each of these objects in your 

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:56.289
 the interior 

00:01:53.069 --> 00:01:57.849
 this is such a big job 

00:01:56.289 --> 00:02:00.849
 especially at the training stage 

00:01:57.849 --> 00:02:03.039
 but it's worth it well for example here for 

00:02:00.849 --> 00:02:04.709
 creating a truly realistic 

00:02:03.039 --> 00:02:07.149
 wood material 

00:02:04.709 --> 00:02:10.599
 it is not enough just to impose a seamless 

00:02:07.149 --> 00:02:12.730
 tree map into syllables taste to mean us 

00:02:10.599 --> 00:02:15.940
 reflection on blur low 

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:17.380
 reflection of glare and adjust the bank then 

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:18.670
 have to get really 

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:20.769
 nice cool wood stuff 

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:22.870
 realistic often required 

00:02:20.769 --> 00:02:26.459
 use of additional cards is 

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:29.110
 reflection maps for inclusion gloss 

00:02:26.459 --> 00:02:31.299
 additional cards of faith goes to 

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:33.720
 get a blackout there in the corners or 

00:02:31.299 --> 00:02:37.200
 Conversely do pull 

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:37.860
 outer corners and if this material diego 

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:40.260
 for example 

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:42.270
 worn out here like this example then 

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:43.290
 do not do simple stuff 

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:45.990
 intel faith 

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:47.940
 how often here is used here already 

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:50.060
 will need to use door material 

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:52.950
 blend is quite a complicated material 

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:56.220
 layered through it you can add 

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:58.110
 this scratches chipped dust layer for example 

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:59.700
 put on the surface yes there so he 

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:00.510
 only lay on top of a 

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:02.940
 other parts 

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:05.370
 it was not on vertical surfaces 

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:08.640
 add paint stains and so on so 

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:10.650
 that new many different effects or 

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:12.990
 here's an example with glass seemingly glass 

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:15.420
 simple material tuned transparency 

00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:17.940
 put the color of the defs without any texture 

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:19.260
 and in general ready but also here 

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:21.480
 not quite so simple 

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:24.180
 each glass has its own small 

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:26.340
 shade well even if you god that tries 

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:28.440
 If you do not see the shade then the elder 

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:31.260
 look at the glass by weight of glass 

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:32.459
 then it will be slightly greenish or 

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:35.520
 bluish tint 

00:03:32.459 --> 00:03:37.760
 who always noticed again this 

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:39.300
 add realism to the example if you have on 

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:41.880
 little table magazine 

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:44.100
 lying on top of the glass it would be nice 

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:45.780
 make it properly good stuff 

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:48.900
 to add this shade 

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:50.670
 would look realistic here 

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:54.330
 necessary when setting up the material 

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:57.000
 set the diffuse light as it should 

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:59.489
 to be at the very person of the sample site 

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:02.670
 bit that is, take a photo and see 

00:03:59.489 --> 00:04:04.549
 where is the darkest color here 

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:07.500
 take this color as diffuse 

00:04:04.549 --> 00:04:09.239
 then adjusts the transparency that is 

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:10.560
 if your glass is completely clean and 

00:04:09.239 --> 00:04:13.410
 accordingly put more 

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:16.350
 transparency if the glass you have not quite 

00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:17.959
 perfectly transparent then paste it 

00:04:16.350 --> 00:04:21.269
 slightly smaller value 

00:04:17.959 --> 00:04:23.580
 also besides the transparency of the glass can 

00:04:21.269 --> 00:04:26.760
 have color for example glassware 

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:27.410
 there are bottles of mugs which they often 

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:29.720
 painted 

00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:32.810
 some kind of tint on camera greenish 

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:35.660
 glass bottles until used you can 

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:36.320
 this is also a parameter but here is the color 

00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:38.690
 hyphen 

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:40.990
 accordingly, this will affect little 

00:04:38.690 --> 00:04:43.550
 and correct to customize this color 

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:44.060
 glass transparent objects any in 

00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:47.090
 principle 

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:48.740
 through color and through the jib foresail multiplayer 

00:04:47.090 --> 00:04:49.510
 i.e. these are two parameters which 

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:53.230
 responsible for 

00:04:49.510 --> 00:04:56.120
 let's say the color of transparent objects 

00:04:53.230 --> 00:04:58.310
 in addition to these, which I took apart 

00:04:56.120 --> 00:05:00.380
 examples there is still a huge 

00:04:58.310 --> 00:05:03.350
 the number of subtleties setting material 

00:05:00.380 --> 00:05:05.540
 but everything here is if you can 

00:05:03.350 --> 00:05:08.090
 study materials begin to create 

00:05:05.540 --> 00:05:09.530
 more detailed elaborated 

00:05:08.090 --> 00:05:12.140
 material for your projects 

00:05:09.530 --> 00:05:14.890
 then the level of your work immediately fly up 

00:05:12.140 --> 00:05:17.600
 to the new mark you can 

00:05:14.890 --> 00:05:20.120
 surprise your fellow customers with new 

00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:21.950
 level of quality new level of realism 

00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:25.280
 and naturally make money on it 

00:05:21.950 --> 00:05:27.680
 more money because you will already 

00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:29.800
 more competitive among all 

00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:32.150
 who can not work with the material 

00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:34.610
 Now I am preparing a series of video lessons 

00:05:32.150 --> 00:05:37.400
 dedicated to creating materials from 

00:05:34.610 --> 00:05:39.650
 simple, most trivial parameters when 

00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:42.620
 you take open 320 almost never 

00:05:39.650 --> 00:05:44.570
 the first time and to the most difficult I will share 

00:05:42.620 --> 00:05:47.180
 all this stuff 

00:05:44.570 --> 00:05:49.160
 working share with you but for this 

00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:51.470
 please write in the comments to 

00:05:49.160 --> 00:05:53.960
 this page what purpose do you want 

00:05:51.470 --> 00:05:56.150
 achieve by studying materials 

00:05:53.960 --> 00:05:58.400
 you why you need it and secondly 

00:05:56.150 --> 00:06:00.350
 what difficulties do you have settings 

00:05:58.400 --> 00:06:02.060
 There are some issues now 

00:06:00.350 --> 00:06:04.330
 arise that you may have no 

00:06:02.060 --> 00:06:07.180
 is obtained or would like to 

00:06:04.330 --> 00:06:09.189
 stupid deeper study i will try you 

00:06:07.180 --> 00:06:11.409
 help solve these all difficulties and 

00:06:09.189 --> 00:06:13.930
 answer all these questions in the following 

00:06:11.409 --> 00:06:17.199
 video write your comments right 

00:06:13.930 --> 00:06:19.659
 down below this video in the comments I 

00:06:17.199 --> 00:06:22.270
 write you the next video and you also 

00:06:19.659 --> 00:06:25.020
 get with you was ivan nikitin thanks 

00:06:22.270 --> 00:06:25.020
 for your attention for now
