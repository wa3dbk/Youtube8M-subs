00:00:38.149 --> 00:00:41.149
 logics 

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:42.710
 let's start with a game for two players in 

00:00:41.149 --> 00:00:44.870
 The first field of the game should be 

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:45.530
 organized in such a way that players 

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:47.390
 were 

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:50.590
 before the battlefield opposite each other 

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:52.340
 to the right of each player are his 

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:54.800
 unused bakugan 

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:55.820
 and the cards to your left every player will 

00:00:54.800 --> 00:01:00.289
 fold their 

00:00:55.820 --> 00:01:01.160
 used bakugan and cards this is a ball 

00:01:00.289 --> 00:01:03.739
 bakugan 

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:04.100
 it opens when it hits the card 

00:01:03.739 --> 00:01:07.190
 the gate 

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:11.000
 inside bakugan its index g is specified 

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:13.700
 strength to start playing each player 

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:16.190
 need to have three bakugan 3 gate cards 

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:18.770

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:19.400
 gold and three cards of abilities one 

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:21.650

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:23.810
 one red and one green all 

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:26.240
 unused cards lie to the right of 

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:28.280
 you logo up so the opponent doesn't 

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:30.380
 saw them the player who first 

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:32.450
 will collect three goal cards to his left 

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:35.520
 wins the game 

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:38.040
 the worldâ€™s gate cards are harder 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:40.440
 the weight of the rest of the cards in color they are 

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:42.540
 silver copper and gold are those 

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:43.530
 cards that you put on the battlefield 

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:47.030
 gate cards 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:50.010
 activates bakugan ability cards 

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:52.050
 ability cards are easier than gate cards 

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:54.420
 they are blue and red or 

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:57.869
 You can change the course with these green cards. 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:02:00.210
 games use them wisely check 

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:02.400
 readiness in battle you have three 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:04.950
 bakugan 3 gate cards and three cards 

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:07.170

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:11.880
 ready to start the game you are ready to do 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:13.170
 first turn of the game at the beginning of the game 

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:15.209
 each player puts 

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:17.340
 one of your cards varrota logo 

00:02:15.209 --> 00:02:19.709
 up into the center of the battlefield farther away 

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:21.570
 closer to their opponent players must 

00:02:19.709 --> 00:02:23.700
 be from the installed world cards 

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:25.769
 at a distance equal to the length of at least 

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:27.810
 two cards to make a throw 

00:02:25.769 --> 00:02:29.880
 the younger player always goes first 

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:32.040
 then players take turns 

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:34.470
 the first player chooses one of his 

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:35.130
 bakugan and throws it at the set 

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:37.890
 gate cards 

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:39.090
 if bakugan misses and misses 

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:41.850
 on the gate cards then the player 

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:44.610
 folds it to your left now your 

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:47.040
 your bakugan goes to the gate card 

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:49.170
 Reveals and remains standing on it 

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:51.299
 now it's your turn to go to your opponent 

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:53.610
 his bakugan falls on the same card 

00:02:51.299 --> 00:02:55.920
 the gate and the battle begins 

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:58.200
 now each player takes his bakugan 

00:02:55.920 --> 00:03:01.560
 and looks at the indicated inside figure 

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:02.880
 g force on his bakugan indicated ri 120g i 

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:05.130
 on your 300g 

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:06.959
 further turn the map of the gate on which 

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:09.030
 opened up bakugan and look at 

00:03:06.959 --> 00:03:11.280
 list of numbers entered in multicolored 

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:13.769
 toys on her left these circles 

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:16.049
 correspond to the sign bakugan numbers 

00:03:13.769 --> 00:03:18.150
 show the amount of bonus signs 

00:03:16.049 --> 00:03:20.010
 of this gate card add a bonus which 

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:24.060
 fits your bakugan 

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:26.130
 so 140 + 300 is equal to 440 j now 

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:29.280
 add the corresponding bonus to 

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:33.209
 jessie li bakugan your opponent 320 

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:35.670
 + 80 equals 400g and in other words you 

00:03:33.209 --> 00:03:37.910
 match red bakugan elements share 

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:40.490
 times with red bonus fire element 

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:42.650
 and brown bakugan soter elements 

00:03:40.490 --> 00:03:46.040
 the brown bonus of the elements of earth is yours 

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:48.260
 the total jess strength is 440 j and y 

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:50.510
 your opponent is only 400g 

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:52.760
 This means that you are taking this card. 

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:55.400
 the gate and your bakugan and put them 

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:57.080
 to your left, remember that whoever is first 

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:58.880
 for owns three gate cards 

00:03:57.080 --> 00:04:01.010
 your opponent wins 

00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:03.320
 puts his loser bakugan to 

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:10.910
 its used bakugan to the left of 

00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:11.900
 yourself first battle for you now again 

00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:14.390
 your turn 

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:16.459
 make a move you throw bakugan trying 

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:18.320
 get on the rest of the map 

00:04:16.459 --> 00:04:20.810
 the gate then throws bakugan your rival 

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:23.690
 now bakugan is again on the same 

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:25.520
 the gate map is another battle on 

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:27.650
 this time there is an inscription on the gate map 

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:31.010
 which changes the course of the battle of each of the two 

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:32.450
 bakugan has the same power 330 jay now 

00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:34.460
 let's look at the gate map 

00:04:32.450 --> 00:04:35.240
 it turns out that you add a bonus in 

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:37.640
 90g 

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:40.010
 and get 420 jay your opponent 

00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:42.050
 adds 140 to his jessie and 

00:04:40.010 --> 00:04:44.360
 gets 470 g 

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:46.490
 but wait it 's not all down on 

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:48.320
 This gate map has some text in 

00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:50.750
 it says that bakugan with less 

00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:52.550
 total g force wins this battle 

00:04:50.750 --> 00:04:54.980
 if a gate is written the map 

00:04:52.550 --> 00:04:56.780
 some rule she takes over the common 

00:04:54.980 --> 00:04:58.610
 rules of the game and so you again 

00:04:56.780 --> 00:05:00.650
 win because you have less 

00:04:58.610 --> 00:05:02.720
 total g force you take your 

00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:04.970
 bakugan and gate card and put them with 

00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:06.980
 used cards and bakugan to the left of 

00:05:04.970 --> 00:05:08.870
 yourself your opponent takes your 

00:05:06.980 --> 00:05:11.240
 bakugan and puts them to his 

00:05:08.870 --> 00:05:11.510
 used cards and bakugan to the left of 

00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:13.490
 myself 

00:05:11.510 --> 00:05:15.560
 but the game is not over you need 

00:05:13.490 --> 00:05:17.419
 get another gate card to 

00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:18.470
 win the game because now the field is not 

00:05:17.419 --> 00:05:20.080
 world cards left 

00:05:18.470 --> 00:05:22.490
 each player takes one more 

00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:24.830
 unused gate card and puts on 

00:05:22.490 --> 00:05:26.690
 battlefield logo up further away from 

00:05:24.830 --> 00:05:28.820
 closer to your opponent 

00:05:26.690 --> 00:05:30.710
 players take turns as before 

00:05:28.820 --> 00:05:33.830
 this went your opponent now your move 

00:05:30.710 --> 00:05:36.100
 look you both again hit one 

00:05:33.830 --> 00:05:38.620
 gate map battle time 

00:05:36.100 --> 00:05:40.150
 the player takes his bakugan and watches him 

00:05:38.620 --> 00:05:41.440
 same strength then you check 

00:05:40.150 --> 00:05:43.630
 corresponding bonus 

00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:47.440
 indicated on the gate map and so have your 

00:05:43.630 --> 00:05:51.550
 opponent 550 plus 50 equals 600 g 

00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:53.260
 and you have 400 + 170 equals 570 g 

00:05:51.550 --> 00:05:55.090
 if there is no gate on the map 

00:05:53.260 --> 00:05:55.720
 additional instructions that could 

00:05:55.090 --> 00:05:57.610
 would help you 

00:05:55.720 --> 00:06:00.220
 still there is one way to save 

00:05:57.610 --> 00:06:02.560
 locations use one of your cards 

00:06:00.220 --> 00:06:04.360
 abilities correctly this is another 

00:06:02.560 --> 00:06:06.310
 weapons in your arsenal let's 

00:06:04.360 --> 00:06:08.410
 look at your unused cards 

00:06:06.310 --> 00:06:10.870
 abilities to decide which one 

00:06:08.410 --> 00:06:13.300
 apply this card gives your bakugan 

00:06:10.870 --> 00:06:15.340
 gain j strength it says her 

00:06:13.300 --> 00:06:16.420
 can be used during the battle and what 

00:06:15.340 --> 00:06:18.730
 your bakugan 

00:06:16.420 --> 00:06:19.630
 increases its g force according to 

00:06:18.730 --> 00:06:21.790
 his element 

00:06:19.630 --> 00:06:23.080
 in this case, you get the gain g 

00:06:21.790 --> 00:06:25.630
 force in 80g 

00:06:23.080 --> 00:06:28.240
 and get five hundred and seventy plus 80 

00:06:25.630 --> 00:06:30.580
 650 j now you fold the gate map 

00:06:28.240 --> 00:06:32.500
 and an abilities card to your left next 

00:06:30.580 --> 00:06:34.540
 with two gate cards that you 

00:06:32.500 --> 00:06:35.290
 captured remember earlier winning three 

00:06:34.540 --> 00:06:37.570
 gate cards 

00:06:35.290 --> 00:06:40.150
 you win the game you win and 

00:06:37.570 --> 00:06:42.310
 last after the game do not forget to return 

00:06:40.150 --> 00:06:44.950
 all cards and all bakugan back to their 

00:06:42.310 --> 00:06:47.020
 initial owner frequent questions 

00:06:44.950 --> 00:06:49.240
 now let's answer some 

00:06:47.020 --> 00:06:51.100
 questions that may arise in the game 

00:06:49.240 --> 00:06:53.860
 what if you hit with your two 

00:06:51.100 --> 00:06:56.290
 bakuganami on your gate card as 

00:06:53.860 --> 00:06:58.300
 you can't leave both your bakugan 

00:06:56.290 --> 00:07:00.220
 on one gate card you need to decide 

00:06:58.300 --> 00:07:02.250
 which of them leave a 

00:07:00.220 --> 00:07:05.440
 move to another gate card 

00:07:02.250 --> 00:07:07.570
 what if you have 2 bakugan on your one 

00:07:05.440 --> 00:07:10.000
 the gate map and the field are no more 

00:07:07.570 --> 00:07:12.070
 cards if you have 2 bakugan on your one 

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:13.470
 the gate map and the field are no more 

00:07:12.070 --> 00:07:16.979
 world cards you automatically 

00:07:13.470 --> 00:07:19.599
 win this gate map and battle 

00:07:16.979 --> 00:07:22.479
 take your bakugan and gate card and 

00:07:19.599 --> 00:07:24.340
 put them to your left what if after 

00:07:22.479 --> 00:07:26.830
 add all the bonuses you have 

00:07:24.340 --> 00:07:28.990
 still equal and g force with opponent 

00:07:26.830 --> 00:07:31.240
 everything is very easy to win the one who 

00:07:28.990 --> 00:07:34.300
 first got my bakugan card 

00:07:31.240 --> 00:07:35.770
 world before this battle what if you 

00:07:34.300 --> 00:07:38.680
 no more left unused 

00:07:35.770 --> 00:07:40.539
 bakugan to your right in this case 

00:07:38.680 --> 00:07:42.969
 just shift and all their 

00:07:40.539 --> 00:07:43.680
 used bakugan back to the right of 

00:07:42.969 --> 00:07:46.270
 myself 

00:07:43.680 --> 00:07:46.990
 folding bakugan can also be 

00:07:46.270 --> 00:07:49.449
 entertainment 

00:07:46.990 --> 00:07:51.370
 this is like folding the ambassador parts
