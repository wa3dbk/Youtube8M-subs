the<00:02:47.069> out<00:02:47.190> point<00:02:47.489> i<00:02:47.670> think<00:02:47.700> was<00:02:48.390> just<00:02:48.930> that<00:02:49.489> in

00:02:50.479 --> 00:02:50.489 
the out point i think was just that in

00:02:50.489 --> 00:02:52.550 
the out point i think was just that in
terms<00:02:50.940> of<00:02:51.150> how<00:02:51.300> the<00:02:51.360> diced<00:02:51.630> mechanics<00:02:52.110> works<00:02:52.380> i

terms of how the diced mechanics works i
explained<00:02:52.980> how<00:02:53.280> things<00:02:53.700> were<00:02:53.850> scaled<00:02:54.209> you

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:54.510 
explained how things were scaled you

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:56.180 
explained how things were scaled you
know<00:02:54.569> measured<00:02:54.840> on<00:02:54.959> a<00:02:54.989> die<00:02:55.260> type<00:02:55.560> scale<00:02:55.950> and

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:56.190 
know measured on a die type scale and

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:58.190 
know measured on a die type scale and
that<00:02:56.580> you<00:02:56.700> had<00:02:56.850> the<00:02:56.940> wild<00:02:57.239> die<00:02:57.390> but<00:02:57.900> one<00:02:58.019> of<00:02:58.110> the

00:02:58.190 --> 00:02:58.200 
that you had the wild die but one of the

00:02:58.200 --> 00:02:59.860 
that you had the wild die but one of the
things<00:02:58.260> that<00:02:58.470> didn't<00:02:58.739> get<00:02:58.860> to<00:02:58.980> mention<00:02:59.100> and

00:02:59.860 --> 00:02:59.870 
things that didn't get to mention and

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:02.300 
things that didn't get to mention and
one<00:03:00.870> of<00:03:00.959> the<00:03:01.019> other<00:03:01.050> cool<00:03:01.440> elements<00:03:01.890> of<00:03:01.980> savage

one of the other cool elements of savage

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:05.509 
one of the other cool elements of savage
worlds<00:03:02.640> is<00:03:02.790> that<00:03:03.180> it<00:03:03.450> also<00:03:04.260> incorporates<00:03:05.070> an

00:03:05.509 --> 00:03:05.519 
worlds is that it also incorporates an

00:03:05.519 --> 00:03:08.000 
worlds is that it also incorporates an
element<00:03:05.910> called<00:03:05.970> a<00:03:06.329> singh<00:03:06.810> which<00:03:07.500> is<00:03:07.709> also

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:08.010 
element called a singh which is also

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:10.009 
element called a singh which is also
sometimes<00:03:08.250> known<00:03:08.459> as<00:03:08.610> exploding<00:03:09.360> dice<00:03:09.600> in

00:03:10.009 --> 00:03:10.019 
sometimes known as exploding dice in

00:03:10.019 --> 00:03:13.130 
sometimes known as exploding dice in
some<00:03:10.950> other<00:03:11.100> systems<00:03:11.640> and<00:03:12.390> what<00:03:12.750> that<00:03:12.959> all

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:13.140 
some other systems and what that all

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:14.990 
some other systems and what that all
that<00:03:13.320> means<00:03:13.680> is<00:03:13.920> that<00:03:13.980> whenever<00:03:14.340> you<00:03:14.640> roll<00:03:14.850> the

00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:15.000 
that means is that whenever you roll the

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.979 
that means is that whenever you roll the
maximum<00:03:15.660> number<00:03:15.690> on<00:03:16.200> a<00:03:16.230> die<00:03:17.090> you<00:03:18.090> get<00:03:18.360> to<00:03:18.600> keep

00:03:18.979 --> 00:03:18.989 
maximum number on a die you get to keep

00:03:18.989 --> 00:03:21.170 
maximum number on a die you get to keep
the<00:03:19.500> the<00:03:19.980> result<00:03:20.370> that<00:03:20.549> you<00:03:20.579> rolled<00:03:20.910> and<00:03:21.120> you

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:21.180 
the the result that you rolled and you

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:23.420 
the the result that you rolled and you
get<00:03:21.329> to<00:03:21.450> roll<00:03:21.630> that<00:03:21.780> died<00:03:21.989> again<00:03:22.380> and<00:03:22.709> you<00:03:23.220> add

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:23.430 
get to roll that died again and you add

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:25.190 
get to roll that died again and you add
the<00:03:23.700> result<00:03:24.030> of<00:03:24.180> the<00:03:24.269> new<00:03:24.480> role<00:03:24.720> to<00:03:25.170> the

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:25.200 
the result of the new role to the

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:27.590 
the result of the new role to the
original<00:03:25.709> total<00:03:26.100> so<00:03:26.910> this<00:03:27.060> creates<00:03:27.390> a<00:03:27.450> really

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:27.600 
original total so this creates a really

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:33.680 
original total so this creates a really
cool<00:03:29.239> feature<00:03:30.239> where<00:03:30.450> by<00:03:31.310> you<00:03:32.310> if<00:03:32.820> you<00:03:33.000> roll<00:03:33.269> an

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:33.690 
cool feature where by you if you roll an

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:35.870 
cool feature where by you if you roll an
eight<00:03:34.140> sided<00:03:34.440> die<00:03:34.650> for<00:03:34.859> example<00:03:35.190> you<00:03:35.340> roll<00:03:35.579> and

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:35.880 
eight sided die for example you roll and

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:38.449 
eight sided die for example you roll and
eight<00:03:36.120> you<00:03:36.989> get<00:03:37.200> to<00:03:37.380> roll<00:03:37.709> the<00:03:37.859> eight-sided<00:03:38.190> I

00:03:38.449 --> 00:03:38.459 
eight you get to roll the eight-sided I

00:03:38.459 --> 00:03:40.789 
eight you get to roll the eight-sided I
again<00:03:38.790> and<00:03:39.060> if<00:03:39.209> you<00:03:39.359> roll<00:03:39.540> for<00:03:39.900> suddenly<00:03:40.560> your

00:03:40.789 --> 00:03:40.799 
again and if you roll for suddenly your

00:03:40.799 --> 00:03:43.460 
again and if you roll for suddenly your
your<00:03:41.190> skill<00:03:41.820> total<00:03:42.299> or<00:03:42.420> your<00:03:42.570> attribute<00:03:43.079> total

00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:43.470 
your skill total or your attribute total

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:46.039 
your skill total or your attribute total
is<00:03:43.650> a<00:03:44.070> 12<00:03:44.519> which<00:03:45.000> means<00:03:45.239> that<00:03:45.329> you<00:03:45.450> can<00:03:45.540> roll

00:03:46.039 --> 00:03:46.049 
is a 12 which means that you can roll

00:03:46.049 --> 00:03:47.810 
is a 12 which means that you can roll
numbers<00:03:46.410> that<00:03:46.590> are<00:03:46.709> higher<00:03:47.010> than<00:03:47.040> the<00:03:47.579> type<00:03:47.790> of

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:47.820 
numbers that are higher than the type of

00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:50.599 
numbers that are higher than the type of
die<00:03:48.120> that<00:03:48.329> you're<00:03:48.510> using<00:03:48.980> so<00:03:49.980> this<00:03:50.160> this<00:03:50.459> is

00:03:50.599 --> 00:03:50.609 
die that you're using so this this is

00:03:50.609 --> 00:03:54.410 
die that you're using so this this is
really<00:03:51.290> opens<00:03:52.290> up<00:03:52.530> the<00:03:53.280> possibility<00:03:53.910> that<00:03:53.940> any

00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:54.420 
really opens up the possibility that any

really opens up the possibility that any
