00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:06.410
 Luciana's mother-in-law, to shake the 

00:00:03.959 --> 00:00:09.750
 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen. 

00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:11.400
 deputies first place they greet 

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:13.139
 the presence of 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:17.600
 that you find here in our 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:21.330
 plenary and again and again 

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:24.840
 that has already been done by the 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:27.750
 personal and courageous the importance of 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:28.800
 vote on the 30-hour draft 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:33.210
 nursing 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:34.890
 We are included in the month of the woman. 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:37.230
 and of course we have many 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:41.579
 nursing professionals are men 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:43.829
 but the vast majority are women and I 

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:46.320
 I do not see the homage bigger than we 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:50.070
 we could do to these women 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:53.370
 workers who are experiencing the 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:57.570
 public health in our country suffering from 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:01:00.059
 in hospitals with the dilemma of lack of 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:03.329
 structure to provide a more 

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:07.740
 qualified patients working 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:11.520
 often dawn days without rest 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:14.270
 a little rest and they deserve 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:18.450
 so not only our recognition 

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:21.630
 but also legislation to ensure that 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:25.680
 a more compatible working day 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:28.619
 with the enormous physical and 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:31.920
 of these professionals . 

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:36.509
 nursing the 30 hours are much more 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:39.780
 deserved are a necessity for 

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:42.899
 maintenance of the health of those 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:45.780
 nursing professionals as well as 

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:49.920
 for better patient care 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:53.280
 that we know we have in the 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:56.479
 nursing a large part of your 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:59.070
 daily care since physicians 

00:01:56.479 --> 00:02:02.890
 attending and caring for patients with 

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:05.580
 a much lower frequency than the 11 

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:07.140
 - nurses and also the auxiliaries 

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:10.420
 of course they are there 

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:13.240
 daily doing this work and 

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:16.510
 developing and caring for patients 

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:19.120
 so I would like to stress again 

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:21.640
 Mr President, we already had the 

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:23.950
 agreement of the college of leaders 

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:27.640
 for the project to be included in the 

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:30.280
 but we also need the agreement 

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:34.239
 to be effectively voted on 

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:37.600
 the staff bench is supporting this 

00:02:34.239 --> 00:02:40.390
 this struggle and we want the 

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:42.910
 set of those who have already accepted the 

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:45.280
 ing on the project agenda is also 

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:48.280
 that we 

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:51.400
 we can effectively vote is this 

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:54.220
 project which is already awaiting 

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:55.540
 voting a long time ago and already 

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:58.050
 since the year 2000 

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:58.050
 thank you
