00:00:08.230 --> 00:00:14.259
 whatsapp youtube today we are going to talk about 

00:00:11.619 --> 00:00:17.439
 details of pros and cons of being in 

00:00:14.259 --> 00:00:19.300
 low cups this related to one of 

00:00:17.439 --> 00:00:22.509
 my past videos that I put here to 

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:25.060
 one side about the trophies and in 

00:00:22.509 --> 00:00:27.820
 The general video has to do with 

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:29.890
 resources so I put a history 

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:32.860
 of attack that I recorded when I was 

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:36.059
 between silver 2 and 3 where I want you to see 

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:39.010
 who all or most of them have 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:41.079
 200,000 gold or elixir 

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:43.239
 one or the other was because they never fail 

00:00:41.079 --> 00:00:45.489
 or one or the other with less because he was 

00:00:43.239 --> 00:00:48.120
 very accessible to steal but in general 

00:00:45.489 --> 00:00:50.260
 all are high figures and the most 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:53.859
 important that these resources are 

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:56.019
 they collected in an hour if I want 

00:00:53.859 --> 00:00:59.050
 mention that he had two barracks of 

00:00:56.019 --> 00:01:01.179
 four accelerated with gems but this is not 

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:03.280
 it means that it is cheating or having 

00:01:01.179 --> 00:01:05.770
 to be buying because with the 

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:08.170
 saplings stones and boxes that collect 

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:11.020
 will be enough to use them 

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:13.180
 wisely complete and always have 

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:15.280
 available for 

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:17.110
 I also leave my video where 

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:20.730
 I speak of ig more so they know 

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:24.120
 take advantage of them in the best way 

00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:27.000
 and now an even more important aspect 

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:30.300
 that my attack log is my record 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:32.490
 of defense I want you to pay attention to 

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:34.980
 the amounts that they stole and see us 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:37.950
 as with the town hall outside more 

00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:41.090
 low cups it was very difficult that they could 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:41.090
 steal many resources 

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:46.060
 some abusive others who are people 

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:49.690
 of high levels in low glasses also 

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:53.970
 that if they broke me but most 

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:53.970
 you can see I did not steal almost anything 

00:01:54.170 --> 00:02:01.180
 and even more important, see that this 

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:03.340
 history covers 15 great tips 

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:05.380
 with this and the figures shown 

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:07.470
 previously I want to do some 

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:10.690
 equations and mathematical calculations 

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:15.100
 singles where you see how in an hour 

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:18.340
 of attack I took 2,220,000 gold 

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:23.590
 approximately and as in 15 days lost 

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:27.550
 only 848,000 now in one hour 

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:30.630
 I got 2,220,000 in half an hour would be a 

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:33.790
 little more than a million and if I lost 

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:35.920
 848,000 in 15 days means that in 

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:39.370
 less than half an hour recover what was lost 

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:42.220
 in almost two weeks 

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:45.310
 and now let's say I invest one hour for 

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:47.379
 day for these 15 days that the truth is going 

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:50.620
 one hour is not much and we close the 

00:02:47.379 --> 00:02:52.989
 amount in two million in fifteen days 

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:55.750
 I will have the amount of 30 million 

00:02:52.989 --> 00:02:57.080
 of gold or of elixir depends what is 

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:59.000
 searching 

00:02:57.080 --> 00:03:01.310
 and with this amount of resources 

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:03.500
 surely you can satisfy 

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:06.250
 needs that your village has during 

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:06.250
 This weather 

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:11.360
 This is where I want to answer these 

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:13.640
 people who gave me their criticism 

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:16.189
 positive and negative in my video of 

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:18.560
 trophies where they said that according to them is 

00:03:16.189 --> 00:03:21.769
 better to be in leagues a little higher 

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:23.659
 like gold 1 and crystal without city councils 

00:03:21.769 --> 00:03:27.109
 are prepared in stores in less than 

00:03:23.659 --> 00:03:29.329
 9 and good if you have some points to 

00:03:27.109 --> 00:03:32.150
 please like for example that some 

00:03:29.329 --> 00:03:34.129
 villages bigger than yours with 

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:36.560
 you only have to be collectors and mines 

00:03:34.129 --> 00:03:38.080
 can get to win rather glasses 

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:41.650
 low 

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:44.110
 but where if they split us the mother is 

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:46.540
 in defense because even though 

00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:48.940
 have the best basic layout a 

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:51.670
 City Hall outside and with your castilla 

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:53.890
 clan always defending with the troops 

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:55.990
 attack you can not defend yourself 

00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:58.840
 also as you would like if you are in 

00:03:55.990 --> 00:04:01.150
 high chunks and consequently we are going 

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:04.530
 to steal many more resources than those who 

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:06.870
 you could be stealing in low glasses 

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:09.150
 even here he added a video a little more 

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:11.040
 recent from my village where I am 

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:13.319
 living in glasses but because I just 

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:15.990
 go up town hall 9 do not pay attention 

00:04:13.319 --> 00:04:18.180
 to how it is accommodated since it is not 

00:04:15.990 --> 00:04:21.000
 all good this is only so that 

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:23.010
 see the record and here I want you to see 

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:25.290
 as there is much difference of the 

00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:28.470
 resources that have robbed me while being in 

00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:30.210
 cups near gold 1 and if on record 

00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:32.480
 attack I also have very amounts 

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:35.130
 high but making a small board 

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:37.919
 cost-benefit you will see that you will see the great 

00:04:35.130 --> 00:04:39.810
 advantage that it is better to keep 

00:04:37.919 --> 00:04:41.910
 centers a few low to be 

00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:44.400
 completely prepared with defenses 

00:04:41.910 --> 00:04:47.030
 troops and town hall good to climb 

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:47.030
 Shopping 

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:53.550
 note big big big note 

00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:55.860
 great with this I 'm not saying that my 

00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:58.530
 word is law and I say completely what 

00:04:55.860 --> 00:05:00.600
 best in the world as it depends on 

00:04:58.530 --> 00:05:02.789
 example if you really are a person 

00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:05.729
 who spends all day you declare 

00:05:02.789 --> 00:05:07.770
 attack attacks without disconnecting can 

00:05:05.729 --> 00:05:10.410
 that with the city council not so high in 

00:05:07.770 --> 00:05:12.990
 high glasses since it is greater benefit 

00:05:10.410 --> 00:05:15.509
 since you're trying a lot more than 

00:05:12.990 --> 00:05:18.750
 that you can lose with this I want to give 

00:05:15.509 --> 00:05:21.900
 understand that this video is only 

00:05:18.750 --> 00:05:23.550
 so they can see how to implement 1 to 3 

00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:26.580
 you can get a lot of 

00:05:23.550 --> 00:05:28.320
 resources without risking so much 

00:05:26.580 --> 00:05:31.650
 will force you to be in the game all day 

00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:34.380
 and more than anything the secret of these robberies 

00:05:31.650 --> 00:05:36.930
 is that there are many abandoned villages or 

00:05:34.380 --> 00:05:39.780
 semi-abandoned people who do not know 

00:05:36.930 --> 00:05:43.099
 connect both in the silver range and 

00:05:39.780 --> 00:05:45.810
 your collectors and mines are at the top 

00:05:43.099 --> 00:05:48.229
 allowing this that we can steal 

00:05:45.810 --> 00:05:50.789
 good amounts of light 

00:05:48.229 --> 00:05:52.650
 again my word is not sacred nor 

00:05:50.789 --> 00:05:55.380
 I am dictating that as well as the norm 

00:05:52.650 --> 00:05:57.990
 how they should play class or class and 

00:05:55.380 --> 00:06:00.509
 how it should form this is only 

00:05:57.990 --> 00:06:02.789
 a very personal opinion so that 

00:06:00.509 --> 00:06:04.979
 you can see in a video some 

00:06:02.789 --> 00:06:07.190
 examples of where you can collect 

00:06:04.979 --> 00:06:09.350
 resources 

00:06:07.190 --> 00:06:11.450
 and well, I hope you have served them 

00:06:09.350 --> 00:06:13.760
 and then remember if you liked to give it a 

00:06:11.450 --> 00:06:16.160
 like share it with your friends too 

00:06:13.760 --> 00:06:18.430
 subscribe I would appreciate it enough 

00:06:16.160 --> 00:06:20.780
 and see you later with another video 

00:06:18.430 --> 00:06:23.650
 again thank you very much and have 

00:06:20.780 --> 00:06:23.650
 a very nice day
