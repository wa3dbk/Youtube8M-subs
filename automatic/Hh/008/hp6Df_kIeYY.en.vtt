Catz<00:00:15.719> and<00:00:16.109> it's<00:00:16.560> supposedly<00:00:16.920> supposed<00:00:17.340> to<00:00:17.430> be

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:17.520 
Catz and it's supposedly supposed to be

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:20.330 
Catz and it's supposedly supposed to be
the<00:00:17.640> Android<00:00:18.090> solution<00:00:18.779> for<00:00:19.470> a<00:00:19.500> video<00:00:19.920> gaming

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:20.340 
the Android solution for a video gaming

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:23.050 
the Android solution for a video gaming
console<00:00:20.789> so<00:00:21.359> I<00:00:21.390> think<00:00:21.689> this<00:00:22.230> thing<00:00:22.500> is

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:23.060 
console so I think this thing is

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:27.259 
console so I think this thing is
basically<00:00:24.060> stupid<00:00:24.960> and<00:00:25.170> irrelevant<00:00:26.099> okay<00:00:26.609> why

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:27.269 
basically stupid and irrelevant okay why

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:31.250 
basically stupid and irrelevant okay why
would<00:00:27.539> you<00:00:27.720> need<00:00:27.990> a<00:00:28.609> android<00:00:29.609> console<00:00:30.449> for

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:31.260 
would you need a android console for

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:34.100 
would you need a android console for
your<00:00:31.410> TV<00:00:31.769> so<00:00:32.070> this<00:00:32.940> is<00:00:32.969> marketed<00:00:33.630> at<00:00:33.840> two

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:34.110 
your TV so this is marketed at two

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:36.470 
your TV so this is marketed at two
hundred<00:00:34.260> and<00:00:34.469> fifty<00:00:34.620> dollars<00:00:35.190> which<00:00:36.030> is<00:00:36.239> quite

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:36.480 
hundred and fifty dollars which is quite

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:38.869 
hundred and fifty dollars which is quite
pricey<00:00:36.809> for<00:00:36.989> considering<00:00:37.739> what<00:00:37.860> it<00:00:37.950> does<00:00:38.100> so

00:00:38.869 --> 00:00:38.879 
pricey for considering what it does so

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:40.580 
pricey for considering what it does so
let<00:00:39.000> me<00:00:39.090> explain<00:00:39.210> so<00:00:39.690> it<00:00:39.809> has<00:00:39.840> the<00:00:40.170> nvidia

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:40.590 
let me explain so it has the nvidia

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:43.310 
let me explain so it has the nvidia
tegra<00:00:40.890> taker<00:00:41.700> for<00:00:41.790> chipset<00:00:42.420> so<00:00:42.629> it<00:00:42.750> is<00:00:42.870> has<00:00:43.140> the

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:43.320 
tegra taker for chipset so it is has the

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:45.459 
tegra taker for chipset so it is has the
same<00:00:43.500> exact<00:00:43.829> chipset<00:00:44.340> as<00:00:44.550> the<00:00:44.820> Nvidia<00:00:45.210> shield

00:00:45.459 --> 00:00:45.469 
same exact chipset as the Nvidia shield

00:00:45.469 --> 00:00:48.020 
same exact chipset as the Nvidia shield
so<00:00:46.469> it'll<00:00:46.800> still<00:00:47.070> have<00:00:47.190> that<00:00:47.309> graphics<00:00:47.820> power

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
so it'll still have that graphics power

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:51.680 
so it'll still have that graphics power
that<00:00:48.510> the<00:00:48.690> Nvidia<00:00:49.050> shield<00:00:49.110> has<00:00:49.680> it<00:00:50.270> has<00:00:51.270> two

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
that the Nvidia shield has it has two

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:53.180 
that the Nvidia shield has it has two
gigs<00:00:51.870> of<00:00:52.079> RAM<00:00:52.320> which<00:00:52.530> isn't<00:00:52.860> really<00:00:52.890> that<00:00:53.129> big

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
gigs of RAM which isn't really that big

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:55.610 
gigs of RAM which isn't really that big
of<00:00:53.340> a<00:00:53.430> deal<00:00:53.610> and<00:00:53.910> it<00:00:54.510> comes<00:00:54.719> with<00:00:54.809> a<00:00:55.170> mobile

00:01:59.959 --> 00:01:59.969 
because it's actually mobile this thing

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:03.260

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:15.180 
with android games I don't see the point

irrelevant I don't even see the point of

less<00:02:55.200> powerful<00:02:55.980> than<00:02:56.220> this<00:02:56.489> because<00:02:56.790> this

00:02:56.990 --> 00:02:57.000 
less powerful than this because this
