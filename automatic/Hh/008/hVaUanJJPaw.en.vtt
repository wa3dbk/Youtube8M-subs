00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:45.690 
I think that the public's being a little

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:48.500 
I think that the public's being a little
hard<00:02:45.870> on<00:02:45.990> them<00:02:46.160> and<00:02:47.160> you<00:02:48.030> know<00:02:48.180> how<00:02:48.300> were<00:02:48.420> they

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:48.510 
hard on them and you know how were they

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:49.820 
hard on them and you know how were they
to<00:02:48.540> know<00:02:48.690> they<00:02:49.050> would<00:02:49.200> have<00:02:49.290> never<00:02:49.440> done<00:02:49.650> this

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:49.830 
to know they would have never done this

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:51.050 
to know they would have never done this
if<00:02:50.070> they<00:02:50.340> knew<00:02:50.460> something<00:02:50.730> like<00:02:50.790> this<00:02:50.850> was

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:51.060 
if they knew something like this was

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:53.480 
if they knew something like this was
going<00:02:51.210> to<00:02:51.270> happen<00:02:51.660> so<00:02:51.930> my<00:02:52.830> heart<00:02:53.040> goes<00:02:53.160> out<00:02:53.280> to

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:53.490 
going to happen so my heart goes out to
