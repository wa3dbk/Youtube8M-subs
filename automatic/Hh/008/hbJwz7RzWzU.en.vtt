00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:09.230
 O 

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:33.950
 relapsed 76 percent chance of 

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:36.830
 target and reckless 50% chance of 

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:39.170
 failure and this is not a 

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:40.790
 acceptable to reach training 

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:43.180
 even the best players of the moment 

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:46.550
 they make mistakes and they risk a lot 

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:50.180
 after all are only human but 

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:53.510
 If it were not for you, I will present the future. 

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:56.360
 our krones taken from 

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:59.000
 perfect decision guaranteed results 

00:00:56.360 --> 00:01:03.620
 this is what the people who is football 

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:06.500
 change is always landmarks for example the 

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:09.170
 but it will now overthrow the 

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:11.270
 now they have button I think the flowers 

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:13.790
 got into the head so far the PV is 

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:15.950
 replaced at the meeting which had 

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:18.470
 to vote in the field of times have changed 

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:20.930
 I do not know if this is soccer 

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:23.330
 last time we will see cristiano ronaldo 

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:27.040
 The question now is whether this will be 

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:27.040
 phenomenal football time 

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:44.430
 Now, in basketball, that's not what counts. 

00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:46.470
 ready done before, we must also 

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:48.840
 football is an unpredictable business 

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:50.040
 I praised Sandro because I had what 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:51.630
 do as happened with the 

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:53.940
 selected means that they 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:56.850
 they are doing and where they are now who 

00:01:53.940 --> 00:02:02.150
 yesterday at 19 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:02.150
 I'm empty adilson I was going 

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:12.200
 the manager knows this 

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:18.240
 um guess the same in the week 

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:20.900
 past realizing that you do not 

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:20.900
 permanent 

00:02:23.609 --> 00:02:32.709
 al wide mock rt thaÃ­s Lauton 

00:02:28.629 --> 00:02:34.390
 leaves that happened because everything 

00:02:32.709 --> 00:02:39.269
 world than to prove that they are 

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:39.269
 wrong to save football 

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:45.129
 I liked what you did in this place. 

00:02:42.609 --> 00:02:47.650
 the game that we the hand is dying 

00:02:45.129 --> 00:02:51.189
 clones are breaking up with him 

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:52.900
 we should say he 's sorry 

00:02:51.189 --> 00:02:54.250
 Let's just post these we want 

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:56.019
 to end the plans but they are 

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:57.730
 invincible latam agrees 

00:02:56.019 --> 00:03:00.639
 no one believes that they can be 

00:02:57.730 --> 00:03:01.510
 defeated but you can do 

00:03:00.639 --> 00:03:04.359
 soap opera 

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:06.400
 I meant all of you together. 

00:03:04.359 --> 00:03:09.519
 remember what makes you 

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:12.400
 you better not be afraid to risk 

00:03:09.519 --> 00:03:14.620
 You play like it's a game. 

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:19.019
 play like a nail you play 

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:23.200
 risk everything to win everything 

00:03:19.019 --> 00:03:26.560
 there is no greater risk than playing without 

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:28.150
 risk is official 

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:30.760
 was a pit challenge for the 

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:33.430
 chocolate listens ipi that will leave the 

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:35.830
 soccer forever the question I do not 

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:37.810
 mayonnaise 

00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:39.970
 this is the stage of most of the planet 

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:42.250
 the whole world is watching who 

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:44.550
 score first we won on Monday 

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:44.550
 chance 

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:50.770
 leave with it 

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:58.220
 ae 

00:04:07.769 --> 00:04:15.930
 do not risk bigger throw bottles for 

00:04:13.749 --> 00:04:15.930
 on here 

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:29.520
 ae 

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:35.889
 the voting of the day 

00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:53.810
 it is not so easy to remember rock 

00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:06.930
 Besides that
