which is here and I've taken one-inch
PVC<00:00:22.020> and<00:00:22.380> I<00:00:22.439> made<00:00:22.590> this<00:00:22.740> giant<00:00:23.220> expansion<00:00:24.150> on

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:24.300 
PVC and I made this giant expansion on

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:30.290 
PVC and I made this giant expansion on
it<00:00:24.480> and<00:00:24.960> we<00:00:25.890> took<00:00:26.580> the<00:00:27.510> stock<00:00:28.640> air<00:00:29.640> you<00:00:30.179> know

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.680 
milliamp hour batteries and yes it's a

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:48.500 
milliamp hour batteries and yes it's a
lot<00:00:47.070> of<00:00:47.129> fun<00:00:47.399> to<00:00:47.460> make<00:00:47.579> this<00:00:47.760> and<00:00:48.030> it's<00:00:48.300> a<00:00:48.360> lot

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
lot of fun to make this and it's a lot

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:50.630 
lot of fun to make this and it's a lot
of<00:00:48.539> fun<00:00:48.750> to<00:00:48.840> shoot<00:00:48.989> it<00:00:49.170> so<00:00:49.379> how<00:00:49.680> it<00:00:50.190> works<00:00:50.219> is

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 
of fun to shoot it so how it works is

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:51.529 
of fun to shoot it so how it works is
you<00:00:50.700> connect<00:00:51.120> everything<00:00:51.329> together

00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539 
you connect everything together

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:53.990 
you connect everything together
everything<00:00:52.469> is<00:00:52.530> in<00:00:52.680> Syria<00:00:53.039> so<00:00:53.309> it's<00:00:53.640> right<00:00:53.789> off

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 
everything is in Syria so it's right off

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.990 
everything is in Syria so it's right off
of<00:00:54.170> nineteen<00:00:55.170> point<00:00:55.410> two<00:00:55.620> volts<00:00:55.789> you<00:00:56.789> press

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000 
of nineteen point two volts you press

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:05.140 
of nineteen point two volts you press
the<00:00:57.149> button<00:00:57.480> on<00:00:57.719> the<00:00:58.199> front<00:00:58.230> here

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:05.150 

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:07.820 

that's<00:01:06.150> not<00:01:06.300> 40<00:01:06.570> psi<00:01:06.960> and<00:01:07.230> then<00:01:07.320> he<00:01:07.380> just<00:01:07.590> fired

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
that's not 40 psi and then he just fired

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:12.170 
that's not 40 psi and then he just fired
by<00:01:08.220> playing<00:01:08.640> the<00:01:08.760> trigger<00:01:10.580> yeah<00:01:11.580> and<00:01:11.970> that's

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 
by playing the trigger yeah and that's

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:15.380 
by playing the trigger yeah and that's
what<00:01:12.420> the<00:01:12.600> stock<00:01:13.910> opening<00:01:14.910> on<00:01:15.060> the<00:01:15.150> front<00:01:15.360> of

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
what the stock opening on the front of

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:17.450 
what the stock opening on the front of
this<00:01:15.510> so<00:01:15.750> really<00:01:16.200> small<00:01:16.500> I<00:01:16.530> can<00:01:16.800> open<00:01:17.130> it<00:01:17.250> but

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460 
this so really small I can open it but

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:20.360 
this so really small I can open it but
you<00:01:17.700> know<00:01:17.820> whatever<00:01:18.290> we<00:01:19.290> took<00:01:19.710> all<00:01:19.890> this<00:01:20.070> and

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:20.370 
you know whatever we took all this and

00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:23.240 
you know whatever we took all this and
we<00:01:20.640> put<00:01:20.880> it<00:01:20.970> onto<00:01:21.120> a<00:01:21.300> launch<00:01:21.660> long<00:01:22.320> shot<00:01:22.830> front

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
we put it onto a launch long shot front

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:27.080 
we put it onto a launch long shot front
gun<00:01:23.780> thing<00:01:24.780> using<00:01:25.260> wire<00:01:26.220> hanger<00:01:26.580> to<00:01:26.760> connect

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
gun thing using wire hanger to connect

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:30.080 
gun thing using wire hanger to connect
the<00:01:27.240> trigger<00:01:27.660> to<00:01:27.960> the<00:01:28.190> roll<00:01:29.190> pin<00:01:29.490> Pole

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
the trigger to the roll pin Pole

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:33.470 
the trigger to the roll pin Pole
so<00:01:30.630> yeah<00:01:31.560> that's<00:01:32.340> that's<00:01:33.000> what<00:01:33.240> we've<00:01:33.390> done

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:33.480 
so yeah that's that's what we've done

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:36.530 
so yeah that's that's what we've done
here<00:01:33.720> so<00:01:34.020> we<00:01:34.770> have<00:01:35.460> its<00:01:35.640> barrel<00:01:36.000> which<00:01:36.150> uses

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:36.540 
here so we have its barrel which uses

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:39.350 
here so we have its barrel which uses
stock<00:01:37.140> darts<00:01:37.500> because<00:01:38.160> it's<00:01:38.340> half-inch<00:01:39.090> PVC

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360 
stock darts because it's half-inch PVC

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:41.750 
stock darts because it's half-inch PVC
and<00:01:39.720> Nazi<00:01:40.020> PVC<00:01:40.410> and<00:01:40.650> I<00:01:41.010> guess<00:01:41.160> well<00:01:41.340> fire<00:01:41.729> it

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:41.760 
and Nazi PVC and I guess well fire it

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:44.750 
and Nazi PVC and I guess well fire it
out<00:01:41.910> the<00:01:42.090> wall<00:01:42.270> for<00:01:42.570> you<00:01:42.630> to<00:01:43.220> show<00:01:44.220> are<00:01:44.400> there's

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:44.760

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:46.190 
out the wall for you to show are there's
a<00:01:44.850> target<00:01:45.180> there<00:01:45.360> will<00:01:45.510> fire<00:01:45.690> at<00:01:45.840> the<00:01:45.900> target

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
a target there will fire at the target

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:48.320 
a target there will fire at the target
to<00:01:46.290> show<00:01:46.620> you<00:01:46.680> how<00:01:46.950> effective<00:01:47.670> it<00:01:47.760> is<00:01:47.820> so<00:01:48.060> let's

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:48.330 
to show you how effective it is so let's

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:49.790 
to show you how effective it is so let's
set<00:01:48.479> up<00:01:48.510> the<00:01:48.660> camera<00:01:48.930> and<00:01:49.140> see<00:01:49.410> what<00:01:49.560> happens

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:49.800 
set up the camera and see what happens

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:51.620 
set up the camera and see what happens
let's<00:01:49.920> do<00:01:50.070> that<00:01:50.250> excellent<00:01:50.820> all<00:01:51.300> right<00:01:51.420> so<00:01:51.570> we

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:51.630 
let's do that excellent all right so we

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:52.880 
let's do that excellent all right so we
have<00:01:51.690> a<00:01:51.780> variety<00:01:52.110> of<00:01:52.290> darts<00:01:52.620> we<00:01:52.740> have<00:01:52.860> a

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:52.890 
have a variety of darts we have a

have a variety of darts we have a
Buzzbee<00:01:53.670> tagger

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:54.870 
Buzzbee tagger

00:01:54.870 --> 00:01:57.410 
Buzzbee tagger
and<00:01:55.340> three<00:01:56.340> two<00:01:56.700> whistlers<00:01:57.120> because<00:01:57.330> they

00:01:59.450 --> 00:01:59.460 
look like crap and so we're just gonna

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:02.060 
look like crap and so we're just gonna
fire<00:01:59.760> these<00:01:59.910> off<00:02:00.120> at<00:02:00.330> this<00:02:00.900> magical<00:02:01.620> target

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:02.070 
fire these off at this magical target

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:04.950 
right here right here and we'll see what

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:06.890 
right here right here and we'll see what
it<00:02:04.979> does<00:02:05.160> to<00:02:05.369> the<00:02:05.460> cardboard<00:02:05.729> so<00:02:06.180> let's<00:02:06.450> do
