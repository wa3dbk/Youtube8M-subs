overseer<00:02:35.780> is<00:02:35.960> 2<00:02:36.230> for<00:02:36.470> 11<00:02:36.650> you<00:02:37.370> tap<00:02:37.580> it<00:02:37.730> and<00:02:37.760> you

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:37.880 
overseer is 2 for 11 you tap it and you

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:39.070 
overseer is 2 for 11 you tap it and you
put<00:02:37.910> a<00:02:38.030> plus<00:02:38.240> on<00:02:38.360> both<00:02:38.450> some<00:02:38.600> counter<00:02:38.840> on<00:02:38.930> each

00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:39.080 
put a plus on both some counter on each

artifact<00:02:39.620> you<00:02:39.740> control<00:02:40.330> artifact<00:02:41.330> creature

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:41.660 
artifact you control artifact creature

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:45.160 
artifact you control artifact creature
so<00:02:42.080> this<00:02:42.860> makes<00:02:43.640> my<00:02:43.940> ornithopters<00:02:44.480> become<00:02:44.750> 45

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:45.170 
so this makes my ornithopters become 45

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:47.440 
so this makes my ornithopters become 45
flyers<00:02:45.500> unlike<00:02:46.310> the<00:02:46.580> sixth<00:02:46.910> earn<00:02:47.150> because<00:02:47.390> I

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:47.450 
flyers unlike the sixth earn because I

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:48.910 
flyers unlike the sixth earn because I
can<00:02:47.600> hold<00:02:47.780> out<00:02:47.930> for<00:02:48.110> that<00:02:48.200> long<00:02:48.410> with<00:02:48.590> a<00:02:48.650> lot<00:02:48.800> of

you know blockers phyrexian walker

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:52.740 
you know blockers phyrexian walker
things<00:02:51.380> like<00:02:51.530> that<00:02:51.680> these<00:02:52.100> are<00:02:52.280> really<00:02:52.460> good
