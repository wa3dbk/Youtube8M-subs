00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:15.400
 a special video today video for 15 

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:18.520
 thousand subscribers today are here with a 

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:23.350
 equally special guest with gtf 

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:26.410
 beautiful bronx girl then many boys 

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:28.450
 of you they will think but who is he 

00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:30.970
 maybe you never heard 

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:32.729
 probably gtf you have already heard 

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:36.880
 talk because he's a clown anyway 

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:40.090
 quite famous on youtube but I'm here 

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:42.610
 precisely with the bronx for let's say 

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:45.520
 talk to you briefly about what 

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:48.509
 let's say it was my start with it 

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:54.070
 started let's say compete 2 up 

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:56.200
 ecological in general I will explain to you I have 

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:59.190
 played a milestone for 

00:01:56.200 --> 00:02:04.450
 understand international Italian yes 

00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:06.990
 knows if it turns out he knew when he was a boy 

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:09.489
 I know how I played on ps3 then 

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:11.049
 we say many provinces but it is not but 

00:02:09.489 --> 00:02:13.780
 undergoes 3 3 it is easy to make the gameplay 

00:02:11.049 --> 00:02:17.440
 kiss xbox 360 and see if it can 

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:20.080
 I can also do them myself, too 

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:26.290
 the other I was one who said this is a 

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:28.090
 nababbo f60 can't tell me what 

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:31.180
 we also say we tell you about skiing 

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:34.540
 bem first man is this of which you 

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:35.650
 I want to talk but let's say that when 

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:38.530
 xbox messes 

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:41.470
 I wanted to be playing the comrades in 

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:44.680
 it passes to the more or less in March and flourishes 

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:47.470
 he meets precisely he bronx who does not 

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:49.420
 called gdf bianconera we are part 

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:52.959
 out of anger 

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:54.790
 I honestly don't know how we know it 

00:02:52.959 --> 00:02:58.120
 we are known is a meeting 

00:02:54.790 --> 00:03:01.360
 quite mysterious the supposition is 

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:03.430
 that I practically entered a group 

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:06.060
 in a part of a friend of mine and there was 

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:08.700
 also wise so at random just yes 

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:11.530
 let's say he started to explain to me 

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:12.910
 sun the foundations of competivi 

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:17.019
 little boy I knew nothing at all playing 

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:19.480
 five years public there is also you ad 

00:03:17.019 --> 00:03:21.400
 example because you are seeing me 

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:24.250
 now you are video and you play 

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:25.569
 however you publish before that 

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:27.370
 the videos on youtube arrived 

00:03:25.569 --> 00:03:29.920
 that is to say the competitive you what 

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:32.500
 you knew you didn't know anything and me too 

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:34.360
 I knew nothing of the desert and said but 

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:37.209
 then guys for you that you are seeing 

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:40.920
 the video you need to know your 

00:03:37.209 --> 00:03:40.920
 idol savin trash 

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:48.670
 I immediately saw something in him that 

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:52.090
 he could do fine while I talked to him 

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:54.519
 of the various competitive options that 

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:59.829
 he had in short, of course, everything 

00:03:54.519 --> 00:04:01.390
 the rest the first few times it takes him 

00:03:59.829 --> 00:04:02.440
 in short with me anyway that we go to 

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:05.920
 to play 

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:08.500
 in competitive mode I saw only one 

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:10.720
 what in him that he could shoot and 

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:15.630
 that's enough because he knows he still shoots a lot 

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:19.019
 very well however with regards to the 

00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:22.079
 the mentality is in short 

00:04:19.019 --> 00:04:24.210
 he was lacking as a competitive player 

00:04:22.079 --> 00:04:27.900
 totally I must say that with the passage of the 

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:30.060
 time then is much improved and it is 

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:33.210
 also arrived at agra levels 

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:36.900
 quite high I would say even high 

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:40.440
 is considered the time in which he played 

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:42.599
 to certain certain competitions he came to 

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:44.819
 levels to the let's say that I started 

00:04:42.599 --> 00:04:46.849
 however, beginning to play with him I 

00:04:44.819 --> 00:04:50.490
 I made my first shy and certain with 

00:04:46.849 --> 00:04:52.500
 in fact, he and I are quite well there 

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:53.699
 that is, if I wanted you, it was the 

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:56.099
 first time he still plays saw 

00:04:53.699 --> 00:04:59.250
 sure because he played player if 

00:04:56.099 --> 00:05:01.440
 I was were if they were three years two 

00:04:59.250 --> 00:05:04.810
 years and a half that I was competitive 

00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:07.180
 in Chad first veteran and then recruit e 

00:05:04.810 --> 00:05:10.600
 and then with him along with Marco 

00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:12.820
 we started playing a little old e 

00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:16.210
 I look together so it was an environment 

00:05:12.820 --> 00:05:18.970
 then new for both says is 

00:05:16.210 --> 00:05:23.230
 this was a bit let's say the story 

00:05:18.970 --> 00:05:25.450
 however, I repeat he was the one who did it 

00:05:23.230 --> 00:05:29.220
 he said let's say he opened it 

00:05:25.450 --> 00:05:31.990
 the doors to the competitive and therefore I want 

00:05:29.220 --> 00:05:34.389
 thank him very much because without 

00:05:31.990 --> 00:05:36.700
 he most likely wouldn't be here 

00:05:34.389 --> 00:05:38.229
 maybe even with 15 thousand subscribers because 

00:05:36.700 --> 00:05:40.350
 many members, however , made them for me 

00:05:38.229 --> 00:05:44.290
 thanks to the competitive and I think that 

00:05:40.350 --> 00:05:46.330
 I will also continue here on ghosts in Genoa 

00:05:44.290 --> 00:05:48.970
 so then to all of you who are 

00:05:46.330 --> 00:05:51.040
 seeing this video as he said it 

00:05:48.970 --> 00:05:51.850
 he and since it is thanks to me that now he 

00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:53.860

 obviously he explained to me too 

00:06:05.770 --> 00:06:12.419
 and here I am also very good at insulting 

00:06:08.050 --> 00:06:12.419

00:06:12.960 --> 00:06:19.630
