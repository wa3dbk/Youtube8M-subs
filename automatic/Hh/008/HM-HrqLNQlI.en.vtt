00:00:03.169 --> 00:00:03.179 
hi I'm Rick Tobey and I'm going to show

00:00:03.179 --> 00:00:05.300 
hi I'm Rick Tobey and I'm going to show
you<00:00:03.210> how<00:00:03.629> to<00:00:03.689> tune<00:00:04.020> your<00:00:04.049> guitar<00:00:04.200> have<00:00:04.950> stepped

00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:05.310 
you how to tune your guitar have stepped

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:07.849 
you how to tune your guitar have stepped
down<00:00:05.660> now<00:00:06.660> this<00:00:06.839> is<00:00:07.020> how<00:00:07.140> it<00:00:07.290> sounds<00:00:07.500> with

00:00:07.849 --> 00:00:07.859 
down now this is how it sounds with

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:12.980 
down now this is how it sounds with
standard<00:00:08.309> tuning<00:00:10.849> but<00:00:11.849> you<00:00:12.030> may<00:00:12.179> find<00:00:12.480> that

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:12.990 
standard tuning but you may find that

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:16.730 
standard tuning but you may find that
you<00:00:14.269> want<00:00:15.269> to<00:00:15.450> put<00:00:15.599> some<00:00:15.780> heavier<00:00:16.109> strings<00:00:16.529> on

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:16.740 
you want to put some heavier strings on

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:20.779 
you want to put some heavier strings on
your<00:00:16.770> guitar<00:00:16.949> and<00:00:19.010> the<00:00:20.010> heavier<00:00:20.400> strings

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:20.789 
your guitar and the heavier strings

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:25.820 
your guitar and the heavier strings
makes<00:00:21.119> it<00:00:21.330> hard<00:00:21.570> to<00:00:21.660> play<00:00:23.180> so<00:00:24.180> you<00:00:24.600> might<00:00:25.199> tune

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:25.830 
makes it hard to play so you might tune

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:29.390 
makes it hard to play so you might tune
your<00:00:26.039> guitar<00:00:26.070> down<00:00:26.730> a<00:00:26.760> half<00:00:27.119> step<00:00:27.330> and<00:00:28.400> that

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:29.400 
your guitar down a half step and that

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:31.370 
your guitar down a half step and that
way<00:00:29.580> the<00:00:29.789> strings<00:00:30.599> will<00:00:30.840> be<00:00:30.869> a<00:00:30.990> little<00:00:31.260> bit

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:31.380 
way the strings will be a little bit

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:35.630 
way the strings will be a little bit
looser<00:00:32.570> and<00:00:33.680> that<00:00:34.680> would<00:00:34.829> make<00:00:35.010> it<00:00:35.160> easier<00:00:35.489> to

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640 
looser and that would make it easier to

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:38.600 
looser and that would make it easier to
play<00:00:35.760> in<00:00:36.270> fact<00:00:36.660> that's<00:00:37.469> what<00:00:37.800> Stevie<00:00:38.430> Ray

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:38.610 
play in fact that's what Stevie Ray

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:42.440 
play in fact that's what Stevie Ray
Vaughan<00:00:38.940> did<00:00:39.860> he<00:00:40.860> used<00:00:41.129> a<00:00:41.309> very<00:00:41.340> heavy<00:00:42.059> gauged

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:42.450 
Vaughan did he used a very heavy gauged

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:48.139 
Vaughan did he used a very heavy gauged
string<00:00:44.960> but<00:00:45.960> then<00:00:46.140> rather<00:00:46.379> than<00:00:46.850> have<00:00:47.850> his

00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:48.149 
string but then rather than have his

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:53.720 
string but then rather than have his
guitar<00:00:48.329> tuned<00:00:49.100> to<00:00:50.100> standard<00:00:50.879> he<00:00:51.629> tuning<00:00:52.730> he

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
guitar tuned to standard he tuning he

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:57.799 
guitar tuned to standard he tuning he
tuned<00:00:54.030> his<00:00:54.270> guitar<00:00:55.399> down<00:00:56.399> to<00:00:56.820> an<00:00:57.149> e-flat

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
tuned his guitar down to an e-flat

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:01.880 
tuned his guitar down to an e-flat
tuning<00:00:59.660> and<00:01:00.660> that<00:01:00.809> enabled<00:01:01.320> him<00:01:01.469> to<00:01:01.680> get<00:01:01.829> a

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
tuning and that enabled him to get a

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:08.630 
tuning and that enabled him to get a
really<00:01:02.510> big<00:01:03.510> full<00:01:04.670> fat<00:01:05.670> sound<00:01:07.400> because<00:01:08.400> he<00:01:08.549> was

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
really big full fat sound because he was

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:12.560 
really big full fat sound because he was
using<00:01:08.820> a<00:01:09.000> much<00:01:09.180> heavier<00:01:09.540> string<00:01:11.270> but<00:01:12.270> it<00:01:12.420> was

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
using a much heavier string but it was

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:17.120 
using a much heavier string but it was
still<00:01:12.930> fairly<00:01:13.380> easy<00:01:13.799> to<00:01:14.040> play<00:01:15.799> because<00:01:16.799> the

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
still fairly easy to play because the

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:19.490 
still fairly easy to play because the
strings<00:01:17.460> were<00:01:18.299> a<00:01:18.330> little<00:01:18.600> bit<00:01:18.720> looser<00:01:19.200> on<00:01:19.229> the

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500 
strings were a little bit looser on the

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:24.660 
strings were a little bit looser on the
neck<00:01:19.710> so<00:01:20.780> now<00:01:21.920> you<00:01:22.920> can<00:01:23.100> hear

00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:24.670 
neck so now you can hear

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:28.930 
neck so now you can hear
the<00:01:25.670> guitar<00:01:26.060> is<00:01:26.390> tuned<00:01:26.780> a<00:01:27.580> little<00:01:28.580> bit<00:01:28.700> lower

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:28.940 
the guitar is tuned a little bit lower

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:31.600 
the guitar is tuned a little bit lower
than<00:01:29.060> it<00:01:29.330> was<00:01:29.360> and<00:01:30.170> so<00:01:30.650> basically<00:01:31.070> what<00:01:31.280> you<00:01:31.460> do

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:31.610 
than it was and so basically what you do

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:33.490 
than it was and so basically what you do
is<00:01:31.790> you<00:01:31.910> have<00:01:32.090> if<00:01:32.510> you<00:01:32.630> have<00:01:32.660> an<00:01:32.930> electronic

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:33.500 
is you have if you have an electronic

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:37.120 
is you have if you have an electronic
tuner<00:01:33.680> which<00:01:34.520> is<00:01:34.640> what<00:01:34.790> I<00:01:34.820> like<00:01:35.150> to<00:01:35.420> use<00:01:36.130> you

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:37.130 
tuner which is what I like to use you

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:39.250 
tuner which is what I like to use you
would<00:01:37.310> just<00:01:37.580> tune<00:01:37.820> to<00:01:38.000> e<00:01:38.030> down<00:01:38.570> to<00:01:38.750> an<00:01:38.870> E<00:01:39.050> flat

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:39.260 
would just tune to e down to an E flat

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:42.550 
would just tune to e down to an E flat
the<00:01:40.190> a<00:01:40.220> string<00:01:40.820> would<00:01:41.270> be<00:01:41.330> tuned<00:01:41.720> down<00:01:41.960> to<00:01:42.260> an<00:01:42.380> a

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:42.560 
the a string would be tuned down to an a

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:48.370 
the a string would be tuned down to an a
flat<00:01:43.480> D<00:01:44.480> string<00:01:44.900> to<00:01:45.140> a<00:01:45.170> D<00:01:45.440> flat<00:01:46.210> the<00:01:47.210> g<00:01:47.960> string

00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:48.380 
flat D string to a D flat the g string

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:53.380 
flat D string to a D flat the g string
to<00:01:48.410> a<00:01:48.680> G<00:01:49.010> flat<00:01:50.440> the<00:01:51.440> B<00:01:51.620> string<00:01:52.070> to<00:01:52.430> a<00:01:52.550> B<00:01:52.820> flat<00:01:52.970> n

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:53.390 
to a G flat the B string to a B flat n

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:56.530 
to a G flat the B string to a B flat n
EE<00:01:53.600> the<00:01:54.290> high<00:01:54.470> E<00:01:54.500> string<00:01:54.850> would<00:01:55.850> be<00:01:55.910> tuned<00:01:56.270> to

00:01:56.530 --> 00:01:56.540 
EE the high E string would be tuned to

00:01:56.540 --> 00:02:01.450 
EE the high E string would be tuned to
an<00:01:56.780> E<00:01:56.930> flat<00:01:57.110> and<00:01:57.970> that's<00:01:58.970> how<00:01:59.240> you<00:02:00.280> tune<00:02:01.280> your

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:01.460 
an E flat and that's how you tune your

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:05.020 
an E flat and that's how you tune your
guitar<00:02:01.490> a<00:02:02.090> half<00:02:02.420> step<00:02:02.750> down
