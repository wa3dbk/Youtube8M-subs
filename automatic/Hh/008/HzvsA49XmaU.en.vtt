and<00:00:21.960> today<00:00:22.260> we're<00:00:22.529> building<00:00:22.740> a<00:00:23.130> new<00:00:23.400> pc<00:00:24.320> main

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:25.320 
and today we're building a new pc main

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:26.870 
and today we're building a new pc main
reason<00:00:25.590> for<00:00:25.619> this<00:00:25.740> is<00:00:25.980> our<00:00:26.160> editing<00:00:26.519> system

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:26.880 
reason for this is our editing system

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:28.849 
reason for this is our editing system
counted<00:00:27.510> out<00:00:27.630> a<00:00:27.660> while<00:00:28.140> ago<00:00:28.170> so<00:00:28.590> if<00:00:28.740> you're

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:28.859 
counted out a while ago so if you're

me at all it means i didn't it up
and<00:00:33.719> it's<00:00:34.500> working<00:00:34.890> so<00:00:35.820> let's<00:00:35.969> go<00:00:36.059> through<00:00:36.239> the

00:00:36.319 --> 00:00:36.329 
and it's working so let's go through the

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:39.380 
and it's working so let's go through the

screws<00:00:56.550> you<00:00:56.760> have<00:00:56.879> to<00:00:57.000> wonder<00:00:57.140> which<00:00:58.140> I've

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:58.410 
screws you have to wonder which I've

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:02.959 
screws you have to wonder which I've
already<00:00:58.649> taken<00:00:58.859> care<00:00:59.010> of<00:01:01.520> the<00:01:02.520> inside<00:01:02.789> of<00:01:02.820> your

already taken care of the inside of your

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:05.030 
already taken care of the inside of your
system<00:01:03.270> is<00:01:03.329> pretty<00:01:03.480> basic<00:01:03.769> make<00:01:04.769> sure<00:01:04.799> you

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040 
system is pretty basic make sure you

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:06.950 
system is pretty basic make sure you
take<00:01:05.189> everything<00:01:05.640> out<00:01:05.790> beforehand<00:01:06.659> as<00:01:06.840> we

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
take everything out beforehand as we

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:09.050 
take everything out beforehand as we
already<00:01:07.110> have<00:01:07.470> and<00:01:07.770> do<00:01:08.310> read<00:01:08.520> the<00:01:08.640> manuals

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060 
already have and do read the manuals

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:10.760 
already have and do read the manuals
I've<00:01:09.510> taken<00:01:09.840> advantage<00:01:10.200> to<00:01:10.290> do<00:01:10.409> this<00:01:10.530> so<00:01:10.740> I

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
I've taken advantage to do this so I

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:12.170 
I've taken advantage to do this so I
know<00:01:10.979> where<00:01:11.340> things<00:01:11.490> go<00:01:11.700> to<00:01:11.760> speed<00:01:12.030> up<00:01:12.119> the

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 
know where things go to speed up the

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:16.310 
know where things go to speed up the

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:27.880 
to mount this one upside down because we

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:29.070 
to mount this one upside down because we

we've gone with 16 gig because of

we've gone with 16 gig because of
obvious<00:05:51.090> reasons<00:05:51.480> well<00:05:51.900> I<00:05:52.110> like<00:05:52.350> to<00:05:52.470> imagine

00:06:00.140 --> 00:06:00.150 

00:06:00.150 --> 00:06:04.020 

now<00:06:01.150> we're<00:06:02.140> running<00:06:02.290> an<00:06:02.620> SSD<00:06:03.580> of<00:06:03.700> the<00:06:03.790> primary

00:06:04.020 --> 00:06:04.030 
now we're running an SSD of the primary

00:06:04.030 --> 00:06:06.420 
now we're running an SSD of the primary
drive<00:06:04.300> on<00:06:04.450> this<00:06:04.860> because<00:06:05.860> honestly<00:06:06.220> they're

00:06:06.420 --> 00:06:06.430 
drive on this because honestly they're

00:06:06.430 --> 00:06:07.980 
drive on this because honestly they're
cheap<00:06:06.670> enough<00:06:06.790> nowadays<00:06:07.150> everyone<00:06:07.840> should<00:06:07.930> be

00:06:07.980 --> 00:06:07.990 
cheap enough nowadays everyone should be

00:06:07.990 --> 00:06:10.860 
cheap enough nowadays everyone should be
running<00:06:08.200> SSDs<00:06:08.740> if<00:06:08.890> they<00:06:08.980> can<00:06:09.270> they're<00:06:10.270> so<00:06:10.570> fast

00:06:10.860 --> 00:06:10.870 
running SSDs if they can they're so fast

00:06:10.870 --> 00:06:18.780 
running SSDs if they can they're so fast
it's<00:06:11.190> seriously<00:06:12.190> amazing<00:06:17.400> if<00:06:18.400> you<00:06:18.550> have<00:06:18.670> any

00:06:18.780 --> 00:06:18.790 
it's seriously amazing if you have any

00:06:18.790 --> 00:06:20.910 
it's seriously amazing if you have any
doubts<00:06:19.090> about<00:06:19.240> how<00:06:19.480> fast<00:06:19.810> an<00:06:20.020> SSD<00:06:20.530> can<00:06:20.740> be

00:06:20.910 --> 00:06:20.920 
doubts about how fast an SSD can be

00:06:20.920 --> 00:06:23.040 
doubts about how fast an SSD can be
consider<00:06:21.730> how<00:06:21.880> fast<00:06:22.150> your<00:06:22.360> smartphone<00:06:22.810> groups

00:06:23.040 --> 00:06:23.050 
consider how fast your smartphone groups

00:06:23.050 --> 00:06:25.350 
consider how fast your smartphone groups
of<00:06:23.260> now<00:06:24.130> imagine<00:06:24.370> your<00:06:24.670> computer<00:06:25.060> could<00:06:25.180> do<00:06:25.270> it

00:06:25.350 --> 00:06:25.360 
of now imagine your computer could do it

00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:33.060 
of now imagine your computer could do it
that<00:06:25.390> quickly<00:06:29.940> and<00:06:31.560> unless<00:06:32.560> you're<00:06:32.860> running

00:06:33.060 --> 00:06:33.070
