 everything is pushed to the limit 

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:30.789
 due mainly to those who practice physical exercises

 tiredness 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:24.940

 in the head and injured area 

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:29.860
 and even depression 

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:34.590
 the search for the perfect body and in the case of the athletes by indices every time 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:36.580

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:09.159
 we are ten years old 

00:02:09.159 --> 00:02:10.219
 for the increase 

00:02:10.219 --> 00:02:13.219

00:02:30.699 --> 00:02:32.979
 eliza's body rings 

00:02:32.979 --> 00:02:36.359
 but a point has arrived that does not give more than nothing else is smart 

00:02:36.359 --> 00:02:38.339
 a physical therapy treatment 

00:02:38.339 --> 00:02:40.340
 for the more experienced 

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:42.989
 like the Olympic champion maurren maggi 

00:02:42.989 --> 00:02:45.119
