buying<00:01:04.909> the<00:01:05.909> Republic<00:01:06.420> things<00:01:06.810> because<00:01:07.560> they

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
buying the Republic things because they

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:10.490 
buying the Republic things because they
are<00:01:07.890> quite<00:01:08.159> crashing<00:01:08.640> at<00:01:08.729> the<00:01:08.850> moment<00:01:09.299> so<00:01:09.500> now

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500 
are quite crashing at the moment so now

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:12.440 
are quite crashing at the moment so now
the<00:01:10.560> reason<00:01:11.010> we're<00:01:11.250> actually<00:01:11.369> bringing<00:01:11.939> the

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
the reason we're actually bringing the

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:14.870 
the reason we're actually bringing the
Venice<00:01:12.840> cloak<00:01:13.080> and<00:01:13.350> the<00:01:13.770> zemerik<00:01:14.430> arrow<00:01:14.580> is

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
Venice cloak and the zemerik arrow is

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:20.570 
Venice cloak and the zemerik arrow is
because<00:01:15.659> if<00:01:16.619> we're<00:01:17.310> not<00:01:17.460> wearing<00:01:17.900> a<00:01:19.100> god<00:01:20.100> item

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
because if we're not wearing a god item

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:22.820 
because if we're not wearing a god item
the<00:01:21.450> monsters<00:01:21.810> of<00:01:21.840> that<00:01:22.110> god<00:01:22.350> will<00:01:22.500> attack<00:01:22.799> us
