00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:14.470

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:16.299
 child legs at extreme autofreak was 

00:00:14.470 --> 00:00:17.920
 but was also always very happy 

00:00:16.299 --> 00:00:18.550

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:19.900
 drawn 

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:21.700
 yes there was actually the wish of 

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:24.750
 autodesigners because you can be creative 

00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:24.750
 and you have to do with cars 

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:32.720
 I am 

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:34.670
 in a very motorsport enthusiastic 

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:37.430
 grown up family so i love 

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:41.060
 cars and that's my childhood so 

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:42.730
 I know racing driver and I've already 

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:45.440
 always watching cars 

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:45.950
 that too is this textile design too 

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:47.780
 to have 

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:49.430
 that then bring in the car too 

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:50.540
 can that drive me on and on 

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:51.410
 of course, the people with those 

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:53.000
 I work 

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:55.850
 So just this thing that I have one 

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:57.380
 car a goal that is fun is 

00:00:55.850 --> 00:01:01.370
 really good that makes me much more 

00:00:57.380 --> 00:01:02.809
 to make fun as an apparel that is 

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:05.300
 his car stays transient for so long 

00:01:02.809 --> 00:01:07.990
 You can see that on the street for so long 

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:07.990
 class 

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:15.460
 I was once a school and that 

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:17.080
 I would have asked my teacher as well 

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:19.570
 that of profession when you drive cars 

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:21.130
 draws and I always have like that 

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:22.810
 answer from him get that yes 

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:23.980
 real engineer so you have to 

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:26.410
 I had mechanical engineering studies 

00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:27.970
 thinks yes and my dad is on one 

00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:30.490
 ceiling only optically draw that can too 

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:32.050
 not having me then as a child 

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:33.790
 once I broke through 

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:35.170
 had painted cars with at night 

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:36.990
 watercolor until one day 

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:39.130
 has found out that actually 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:41.640
 automobile design gives and you can do it 

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:41.640
 to study 

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:50.830
 we always had the development process 

00:01:48.729 --> 00:01:53.500
 two great role models that was once the 

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:55.540
 first wolf the lonely wolf because of 

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:57.729
 just the icon is the original and the 

00:01:55.540 --> 00:01:59.410
 Four golf in the timeless and the him 

00:01:57.729 --> 00:02:02.729
 even after years, they open me completely 

00:01:59.410 --> 00:02:02.729
 small car 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:08.190
 you just have to get the gulf war 

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:10.050
 but you can not do anything right now 

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:12.470
 Do what the conservative is the golf 

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:14.280
 the time I have to adapt just now 

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:15.569
 You can not just do that now 

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:16.950
 do next golf and that's how it is 

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:21.060
 and so on but the gold has something 

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:23.580
 can and there is the idea born golf 

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:25.500
 to do that is very dynamic to stop 

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:28.110
 the customer in connection with the 

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:30.650
 reduced weight consumption advantages 

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:30.650
 to procure 

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:35.530
 the word has moved forward 

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:38.050
 This is what this name is 

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:39.910
 the premium measure between raab 

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:42.760
 center and animals become larger 

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:45.310
 So show more tin animals hood 

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:46.240
 zentaris this whole cabin visually 

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:49.380
 Further backwards 

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:51.630
 hiked behind 

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:55.800
 the cd should be right on the 

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:57.390
 rear wheel just emphasizes this body 

00:02:55.800 --> 00:03:00.030
 lead and is of course the typical 

00:02:57.390 --> 00:03:01.650
 golf element at golf 7 

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:03.600
 we have a driver again 

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:05.700
 Orientation so you will sit in it all 

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:07.530
 functions as well as arranged 

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:10.650
 Shutdown is much higher now 

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:12.450
 much sportier than previously so moved 

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:13.830
 between the steering wheel and must switch 

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:15.690
 shorter 

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:17.730
 Of course, for the sportiness of the 

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:20.460
 extra the design of the golf may also 

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:24.680
 do not wear that is not allowed 

00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:24.680
 look old after 34 years old 

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:30.990
 when a person first has a golf 

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:33.300
 then he should definitely rise 

00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:35.040
 first see this quality impression 

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:36.570
 and look around you beautiful 

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:38.580
 Decors one sees the perfect 

00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:41.340
 just process this 

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:43.320
 high quality and it is always that 

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:45.000
 precision that is in the foreground 

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:48.540
 and that has been the goal and that is 

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:52.560
 Even so, the first impression is 

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:55.620
 that the car has climbed a cup 

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:59.010
 the car has become a cup more valuable 

00:03:55.620 --> 00:04:02.629
 is the car really 

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:02.629
 the golf class redefined 

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:09.909
 Yesterday on 11/05/2009 I remember 

00:04:08.409 --> 00:04:11.739
 pretty much the date then the 

00:04:09.909 --> 00:04:13.540
 call from my boss who philippines we 

00:04:11.739 --> 00:04:14.290
 have just selected your design 

00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:15.879
 found 

00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:17.940
 that was really the fulfillment of the 

00:04:15.879 --> 00:04:17.940
 , dream
