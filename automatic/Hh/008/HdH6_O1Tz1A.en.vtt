00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:10.620
 yes there we have the little one again 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:12.510
 problem 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:14.790
 I just hope nobody asks me 

00:00:12.510 --> 00:00:16.230
 what kind of engine that is now 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:20.640
 somehow I do not know it is now 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:23.070
 a v 2 x 2 1 nv 4 is in any case 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:25.380
 This monster is equipped with two LEDs 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:28.130
 jokes evolution engines in a row 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:28.130
 are installed 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:38.200
 It feels like a thing about ten 

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:40.720
 meter long but the wheelbase is 

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:42.640
 just over 2 feet and in real life 

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:45.370
 the part always really has to mist 

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:48.310
 only two meters seventy length of this part 

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:51.070
 where I like to partake is a monster 

00:00:48.310 --> 00:00:54.520
 built in twelve years by the cologne 

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:57.309
 designer christoph mattes the thing 160 

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:59.950
 He and ps have been with him for twelve years 

00:00:57.309 --> 00:01:01.780
 worked but because everything really well 

00:00:59.950 --> 00:01:04.150
 everything except for the exhaust and the 

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:06.280
 spring elements is self-built if you 

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:08.770
 times from the side of the transmission looks 

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:11.590
 The drive is also a left-hand drive 

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:14.110
 or on the right this on gewÃ¼rm 

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:15.610
 is also such a homemade construction so there is 

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:17.710
 really almost nothing he does not do himself 

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:18.460
 has done in the very long time of 

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:20.619
 12 years 

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:23.820
 funnily, that almost drives us 

00:01:20.619 --> 00:01:23.820
 normal motors 

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:31.920
 Well, no matter the short time I 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:34.410
 spent in Cologne with the white thing 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:36.090
 Best of all right back in 

00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:38.580
 where it is now the last seven 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:42.650
 years of bars has namely in the office 

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:42.650
 of the cologne designer
