00:05:46.090 --> 00:05:46.100 
when you saw him and cuz I think

00:05:46.100 --> 00:05:49.590 
when you saw him and cuz I think
actually<00:05:46.490> that<00:05:46.700> was<00:05:46.970> the<00:05:47.000> best<00:05:47.270> part<00:05:47.600> and<00:05:48.560> I

00:05:49.590 --> 00:05:49.600 
actually that was the best part and I

00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:52.180 
actually that was the best part and I
know<00:05:50.600> it's<00:05:50.930> really<00:05:51.260> hard<00:05:51.530> I<00:05:51.650> think<00:05:51.710> the<00:05:51.920> first

00:05:52.180 --> 00:05:52.190 
know it's really hard I think the first

00:05:52.190 --> 00:05:55.630 
know it's really hard I think the first
one<00:05:52.310> was<00:05:52.430> more<00:05:53.620> focusing<00:05:54.620> in<00:05:54.680> on<00:05:54.770> him<00:05:55.130> we<00:05:55.400> saw

00:05:55.630 --> 00:05:55.640 
one was more focusing in on him we saw

00:05:55.640 --> 00:05:57.250 
one was more focusing in on him we saw
him<00:05:55.880> more<00:05:56.120> in<00:05:56.240> the<00:05:56.330> video<00:05:56.660> and<00:05:56.840> we<00:05:56.870> saw<00:05:57.080> him

00:05:57.250 --> 00:05:57.260 
him more in the video and we saw him

00:05:57.260 --> 00:06:00.700 
him more in the video and we saw him
sing<00:05:57.560> more<00:05:57.770> and<00:05:59.140> but<00:06:00.140> I<00:06:00.170> think<00:06:00.380> my<00:06:00.470> favorite

00:06:00.700 --> 00:06:00.710 
sing more and but I think my favorite

00:06:00.710 --> 00:06:03.010 
sing more and but I think my favorite
about<00:06:01.070> all<00:06:01.220> these<00:06:01.370> three<00:06:01.790> I<00:06:02.030> think<00:06:02.630> that's

00:06:03.010 --> 00:06:03.020 
about all these three I think that's

00:06:03.020 --> 00:06:07.360 
about all these three I think that's
this<00:06:03.380> I<00:06:05.350> think<00:06:06.350> that's<00:06:06.620> the<00:06:06.680> second<00:06:07.040> one<00:06:07.160> and

00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:07.370 
this I think that's the second one and

00:06:07.370 --> 00:06:09.640 
this I think that's the second one and
then<00:06:07.850> it<00:06:08.000> comes<00:06:08.180> the<00:06:08.240> first<00:06:08.570> one<00:06:08.810> I<00:06:08.960> think<00:06:09.050> the

00:06:09.640 --> 00:06:09.650 
then it comes the first one I think the

00:06:09.650 --> 00:06:11.560 
then it comes the first one I think the
third<00:06:09.950> one<00:06:10.160> comes<00:06:10.580> on<00:06:10.730> the<00:06:10.820> third<00:06:11.030> place<00:06:11.330> as

00:06:11.560 --> 00:06:11.570 
third one comes on the third place as

00:06:11.570 --> 00:06:13.900 
third one comes on the third place as
