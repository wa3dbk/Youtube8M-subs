00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:06.580
 Today is a cell 

00:00:03.100 --> 00:00:11.500
 It's undressing, I'm a little hot 

00:00:06.580 --> 00:00:17.170
 The Well arrows nx f 04 gun It is a ne Mobile conference is in such 

00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:20.690
 Now we Tamaa color to Molitor is the value ordering look understood from behind Well I always white 

00:00:17.170 --> 00:00:24.500
 Well , because I'm choosing 

00:00:20.690 --> 00:00:28.820
 I think people would be well commonplace though you might think is obvious say 

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:34.370
 Well that's aside f 04 here 

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:37.789
 Here is the world's first with an infrared camera attached Iris authentication 

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:40.650
 In has become a smart phone that can Well unlocked 

00:00:37.789 --> 00:00:44.640
 Well it's called Ice Passport 

00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:49.140
 Now, with this iris authentication enabled 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:53.790
 I'm using a red lamp here over winter, I guess that's an iris certification 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:55.780
 I'm a little It is a this in It is an infrared lamp used in 

00:00:53.790 --> 00:01:01.059
 Asshima' was 

00:00:55.780 --> 00:01:03.180
 Pasokodo course is back and iris Please wait a moment it is the iris authentication in the authentication, etc. 

00:01:01.059 --> 00:01:03.180
 Ne 

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:15.600
 It is a now iris recognition it six times vehicles 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:16.890
 Actually I can set the eye to be transferred with iris authentication default, but my own eyes 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:20.340
 What degree intends It is the 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:22.680
 It 's also a little bit to see , so now Iris authentication 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:26.700
 Don't look at your own eyes 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:32.120
 Well you can kind of set you Yes is set so that it does not appear or rather not see 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:38.840
 Honda is not that, because I actually use this infrared camera 

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:42.590
 As a fault It is outside when it is a place that is hit by sunshine. 

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:47.060
 It says that it does not go well, so there is such a drawback 

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:48.940
 There's no fact to eliminate it 

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:52.930
 Something like a band 

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:54.220
 People and Do too little seen of the blog that I thought or not that different from the way and resting on my blog 

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:57.520
 I feel like 

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:59.280
 It is smart watch 3 android wear to Sony's booth 

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:01.409
 Actually this is now 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:07.049
 With this f 0 g 

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:08.640
 This f 04 g is a smart lock android 

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:12.550
 So you from 5.0 

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:14.740
 It is function well, but constant condition 

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:17.980
 I do not know 

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:23.860
 Unlock security certificate 

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:26.170
 Well there is a function that can be omitted, so it is too smart Otti too 

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:29.290
 It is lock when it is connected 

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:31.360
 It has a set of canceled You're by emitted 

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:34.900
 You know a little bit now 

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:36.240
 Now in fact that bluetooth This cut has Tsu will not be a little better 4 of 

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:41.100
 I guess 

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:46.130
 It has been disconnected now from now on bluetooth turned on 

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:49.790
 You know actually unlock authentication is 

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:55.750
 I would like to go to see if it is bypassed 

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:55.750
 I heard the screen in the lock again I need to be iris authentication 

00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:59.330
 Yes 

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:06.720
 Because anything was canceled by the game, it enters 

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:08.700
 I Burujin turns on because it is off 

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:09.890
 It became Omoto 

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:11.630
 so 

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:13.400
 here 

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:16.540
 Yes 

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:21.459
 That was connected properly 

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:24.810
 It seems like it's secular and it's no longer in the table. 

00:03:21.459 --> 00:03:24.810
 Let's say yes 

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:35.269
 It's a little different right now, the lamp doesn't shine here and beyond the screen 

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:37.660
 I will skype 

00:03:35.269 --> 00:03:40.560
 High rock 

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:44.959
 Hey, just below it will be can only be released easily 

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:45.840
 Is that we can set up well to say that 

00:03:44.959 --> 00:03:47.420
 so 

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:49.740
 Good 

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:50.900
 Well it is, in turn 

00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:54.740
 Also 

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:55.610
 Please try to disconnect in connection audit 

00:03:54.740 --> 00:03:58.480
 Yes 

00:03:55.610 --> 00:03:58.480
 I made a decision 

00:03:59.020 --> 00:04:07.590
 Here's an example of an application that detects that disconnection . 

00:04:04.570 --> 00:04:07.590
 But please take a moment 

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:17.060
 Please wait for a while then lock 

00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:22.310
 Apparently it is and a little once again not by this I'm kinda array with you 

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:26.900
 It is I seemed not return to I unlock method is the original do 

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:27.590
 In is not it such Toka Well 1-minute increments even if eating rose You waited a while 

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:33.950
 Yes 

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:38.760
 Also restored Well in this doing Yes and iris authentication English that lamp is shining 

00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:44.010
 Is back on how to unlock 

00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:47.940
 Something quite when Well go out You know is if 

00:04:44.010 --> 00:04:51.990
 If Iris authentication doesn't work , something like a bluetooth device 

00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:54.400
 In the same way that you get attached to that android wear and get that android wear 

00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:57.409
 Than may be without 

00:04:54.400 --> 00:05:00.889
 Well, for example, yes. 

00:04:57.409 --> 00:05:04.309
 What should I do? 

00:05:00.889 --> 00:05:09.379
 Well I want to pair with some bluetooth device 

00:05:04.309 --> 00:05:12.840
 Well if you add it to that trusted device in state 

00:05:09.379 --> 00:05:18.090
 It is unlocked so you can bypass it 

00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:22.990
 Please try it by all means and it's a little losing, but write it on your blog after this 

00:05:18.090 --> 00:05:29.200
 Temporarily in a state that also led if I'd 

00:05:22.990 --> 00:05:31.630
 Because if you want to revive a way of unlocking that was set originally marked with a key mark of here near 

00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:34.810
 That 

00:05:31.630 --> 00:05:39.550
 That's right when you push it 

00:05:34.810 --> 00:05:42.699
 It has become the wind that will return to restore the high authentication method 

00:05:39.550 --> 00:05:45.180
 Yes, for reference 

00:05:42.699 --> 00:05:45.180
 It was not
