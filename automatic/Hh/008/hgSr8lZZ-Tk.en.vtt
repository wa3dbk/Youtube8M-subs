to<00:01:22.020> install<00:01:22.470> the<00:01:22.680> top<00:01:22.950> piece<00:01:23.310> I<00:01:23.670> actually<00:01:24.299> like

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659 
to install the top piece I actually like

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:27.289 
to install the top piece I actually like
to<00:01:24.869> open<00:01:25.439> it<00:01:25.530> up<00:01:25.680> a<00:01:25.830> little<00:01:25.950> bit<00:01:26.189> if<00:01:26.820> you<00:01:26.939> open

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:27.299 
to open it up a little bit if you open

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:29.870 
to open it up a little bit if you open
it<00:01:27.390> up<00:01:27.600> then<00:01:28.380> you<00:01:28.560> can<00:01:28.710> get<00:01:28.920> these<00:01:29.159> latches

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
it up then you can get these latches

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:32.090 
it up then you can get these latches
around<00:01:30.450> the<00:01:30.570> top<00:01:30.840> a<00:01:30.869> little<00:01:30.990> bit<00:01:31.290> better<00:01:31.439> so

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 
around the top a little bit better so

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:34.039 
around the top a little bit better so
what<00:01:32.430> I've<00:01:32.520> had<00:01:32.729> the<00:01:32.820> best<00:01:33.060> luck<00:01:33.180> with<00:01:33.360> so<00:01:33.750> far

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:34.049 
what I've had the best luck with so far

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:37.280 
what I've had the best luck with so far
is<00:01:34.490> actually<00:01:35.509> putting<00:01:36.509> it<00:01:36.689> on<00:01:36.840> the<00:01:37.049> inside

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:37.290 
is actually putting it on the inside

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:39.530 
is actually putting it on the inside
towards<00:01:37.979> the<00:01:38.070> keyboard<00:01:38.520> first<00:01:38.939> and<00:01:39.270> let's

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:39.540 
towards the keyboard first and let's

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:41.090 
towards the keyboard first and let's
listening<00:01:39.930> to<00:01:40.020> that<00:01:40.200> click<00:01:40.500> right<00:01:40.740> in<00:01:40.920> and

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.100 
listening to that click right in and

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:44.240 
listening to that click right in and
then<00:01:41.850> making<00:01:42.360> sure<00:01:42.780> it<00:01:42.990> goes<00:01:43.170> over<00:01:43.680> and<00:01:43.950> clicks

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250 
then making sure it goes over and clicks

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:46.190 
then making sure it goes over and clicks
on<00:01:44.430> to<00:01:44.610> that<00:01:44.729> top<00:01:45.030> side<00:01:45.360> so<00:01:45.810> you<00:01:45.840> can<00:01:45.899> see<00:01:46.049> it's

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
on to that top side so you can see it's

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:47.420
