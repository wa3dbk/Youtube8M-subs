00:02:00.399 --> 00:02:03.359 
events I've been here con fatale and a
small<00:02:00.640> EO<00:02:00.790> that<00:02:01.060> eases<00:02:01.689> a<00:02:01.840> so<00:02:02.740> unless<00:02:02.979> I<00:02:03.189> guess

00:02:03.359 --> 00:02:03.369 
small EO that eases a so unless I guess

00:02:03.369 --> 00:02:05.219 
small EO that eases a so unless I guess
I<00:02:03.549> mean<00:02:03.759> I<00:02:03.850> could<00:02:04.030> definitely<00:02:04.450> get<00:02:04.899> enough

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:05.229 
I mean I could definitely get enough

00:02:05.229 --> 00:02:07.230 
I mean I could definitely get enough
it's<00:02:05.500> in<00:02:05.770> the<00:02:06.100> mathematical<00:02:06.759> realm<00:02:06.970> of

00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:07.240 
it's in the mathematical realm of

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:09.300 
it's in the mathematical realm of
possibilities<00:02:07.810> but<00:02:07.960> I<00:02:08.380> don't<00:02:09.009> know<00:02:09.100> if<00:02:09.190> I'm

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:09.310 
possibilities but I don't know if I'm

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:11.040 
possibilities but I don't know if I'm
going<00:02:09.459> on<00:02:09.580> this<00:02:09.640> folio<00:02:10.030> and<00:02:10.060> I<00:02:10.509> think<00:02:10.869> that's

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:11.050 
going on this folio and I think that's

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:17.330 
going on this folio and I think that's
more<00:02:11.260> of<00:02:11.319> a<00:02:11.440> possibility<00:02:11.590> wrong<00:02:12.160> yeah<00:02:15.840> yeah

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:17.340 
more of a possibility wrong yeah yeah

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:20.130 
more of a possibility wrong yeah yeah
next<00:02:18.340> what's<00:02:18.910> up<00:02:19.060> I<00:02:19.269> got<00:02:19.390> a<00:02:19.510> server<00:02:19.750> gets<00:02:19.900> it
