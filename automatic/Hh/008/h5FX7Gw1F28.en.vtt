the winger ends up picking it up in

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:07.819 
the winger ends up picking it up in
anyways<00:02:05.460> and<00:02:06.110> that's<00:02:07.110> he's<00:02:07.259> skating<00:02:07.560> down<00:02:07.710> the

00:02:07.819 --> 00:02:07.829

anyways and that's he's skating down the
wing<00:02:07.979> it<00:02:08.429> me<00:02:08.640> it's<00:02:08.759> pretty<00:02:08.940> obvious<00:02:09.239> that's

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:09.390 
wing it me it's pretty obvious that's

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:10.850 
wing it me it's pretty obvious that's
his<00:02:09.509> only<00:02:09.690> passing<00:02:10.200> option<00:02:10.500> right<00:02:10.619> there's

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:10.860 
his only passing option right there's

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:12.890 
his only passing option right there's
that<00:02:11.250> pass<00:02:11.430> across<00:02:11.700> the<00:02:11.790> middle<00:02:12.150> mean<00:02:12.480> that's

that pass across the middle mean that's

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:13.290 
that pass across the middle mean that's
pretty

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:13.300 
pretty

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:15.150 
pretty
thing<00:02:13.540> too<00:02:13.720> is<00:02:13.960> reading<00:02:14.500> the<00:02:14.620> play<00:02:14.800> you'd

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:15.160 
thing too is reading the play you'd

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:16.320 
thing too is reading the play you'd
always<00:02:15.280> be<00:02:15.430> thinking<00:02:15.640> when<00:02:15.910> your<00:02:16.030> defense

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:16.330 
always be thinking when your defense

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:18.300 
always be thinking when your defense
what<00:02:16.630> would<00:02:16.750> I<00:02:16.780> do<00:02:16.930> if<00:02:17.140> I<00:02:17.410> had<00:02:17.770> the<00:02:17.920> puck<00:02:18.070> right

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:18.310 
what would I do if I had the puck right

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:21.330 
what would I do if I had the puck right
now<00:02:18.460> and<00:02:18.790> obviously<00:02:19.390> we<00:02:20.290> would<00:02:20.500> probably<00:02:21.250> try

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:21.340 
now and obviously we would probably try

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:22.530 
now and obviously we would probably try
to<00:02:21.400> get<00:02:21.580> the<00:02:21.670> puck<00:02:21.790> to<00:02:21.910> the<00:02:21.940> guy<00:02:22.090> in<00:02:22.210> the<00:02:22.300> slots

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:22.540 
to get the puck to the guy in the slots

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:24.210 
to get the puck to the guy in the slots
we<00:02:23.050> all<00:02:23.230> do<00:02:23.590> a<00:02:23.620> pretty<00:02:23.830> good<00:02:23.920> job<00:02:24.040> of

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:24.220 
we all do a pretty good job of

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:25.770 
we all do a pretty good job of
recognizing<00:02:24.430> that<00:02:24.940> jumping<00:02:25.330> in<00:02:25.450> the<00:02:25.510> middle

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:25.780 
recognizing that jumping in the middle

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:27.810 
recognizing that jumping in the middle
and<00:02:25.990> just<00:02:26.020> by<00:02:26.500> standing<00:02:27.040> in<00:02:27.310> the<00:02:27.370> passing<00:02:27.700> and

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:27.820 
and just by standing in the passing and

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:29.880 
and just by standing in the passing and
holding<00:02:28.060> down<00:02:28.180> left<00:02:28.480> trigger<00:02:28.660> I<00:02:29.020> intercept

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:29.890 
holding down left trigger I intercept

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:31.880 
holding down left trigger I intercept
the<00:02:29.950> pass<00:02:30.160> and<00:02:30.190> least<00:02:30.790> an<00:02:30.940> easy<00:02:31.120> break<00:02:31.390> out<00:02:31.600> and

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:31.890 
the pass and least an easy break out and

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:33.840 
the pass and least an easy break out and
really<00:02:32.890> what<00:02:33.100> he<00:02:33.220> probably<00:02:33.460> should<00:02:33.730> have<00:02:33.790> done

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:33.850 
really what he probably should have done

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:34.920 
really what he probably should have done
when<00:02:34.060> he<00:02:34.120> was<00:02:34.240> down<00:02:34.330> here<00:02:34.510> is<00:02:34.630> probably<00:02:34.840> just

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:34.930 
when he was down here is probably just

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:36.780 
when he was down here is probably just
put<00:02:35.110> along<00:02:35.320> the<00:02:35.470> boards<00:02:35.830> and<00:02:36.040> back<00:02:36.460> to<00:02:36.580> the<00:02:36.670> d
