00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:08.140 
hello guys this is power gamer 500 and

00:00:08.140 --> 00:00:09.750 
hello guys this is power gamer 500 and
today<00:00:08.440> I'm<00:00:08.559> going<00:00:08.710> to<00:00:08.800> show<00:00:09.010> you<00:00:09.040> how<00:00:09.340> to<00:00:09.400> make

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:09.760 
today I'm going to show you how to make

00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:13.440 
today I'm going to show you how to make
a<00:00:10.000> very<00:00:10.630> good<00:00:11.070> piston<00:00:12.070> trap<00:00:12.400> sticky<00:00:13.090> piston

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:13.450 
a very good piston trap sticky piston

00:00:13.450 --> 00:00:16.080 
a very good piston trap sticky piston
trap<00:00:13.690> that<00:00:14.440> will<00:00:14.650> kill<00:00:15.280> all<00:00:15.490> your<00:00:15.670> friends<00:00:15.700> if

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:16.090 
trap that will kill all your friends if

00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:18.810 
trap that will kill all your friends if
they<00:00:16.209> try<00:00:16.480> and<00:00:16.600> go<00:00:16.779> through<00:00:17.020> this<00:00:17.430> so<00:00:18.430> just<00:00:18.760> a

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:18.820 
they try and go through this so just a

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:20.519 
they try and go through this so just a
normal<00:00:19.119> hallway<00:00:19.480> and<00:00:19.660> you're<00:00:19.750> walking<00:00:19.960> and

00:00:20.519 --> 00:00:20.529 
normal hallway and you're walking and

00:00:20.529 --> 00:00:27.859 
normal hallway and you're walking and
you<00:00:21.460> fall<00:00:21.669> into<00:00:21.880> lava<00:00:22.180> and<00:00:22.509> you<00:00:23.439> get<00:00:23.590> trapped

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:27.869 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:31.970 

so<00:00:28.869> it's<00:00:29.230> very<00:00:29.349> easy<00:00:29.680> just<00:00:30.070> to<00:00:30.189> put<00:00:30.430> the<00:00:30.520> pit

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:31.980 
so it's very easy just to put the pit

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:33.930 
so it's very easy just to put the pit
whatever<00:00:32.980> they're<00:00:33.160> called<00:00:33.340> pressure<00:00:33.610> plates

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:33.940 
whatever they're called pressure plates

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:36.540 
whatever they're called pressure plates
right<00:00:34.210> by<00:00:34.630> the<00:00:34.690> stairs<00:00:35.079> and<00:00:35.410> step<00:00:36.010> on<00:00:36.160> them<00:00:36.340> and

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:36.550 
right by the stairs and step on them and

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:39.119 
right by the stairs and step on them and
there's<00:00:36.699> lava<00:00:37.260> materials<00:00:38.260> we'll<00:00:38.500> need<00:00:38.530> you'll

00:00:39.119 --> 00:00:39.129 
there's lava materials we'll need you'll

00:00:39.129 --> 00:00:42.560 
there's lava materials we'll need you'll
need<00:00:39.399> it<00:00:39.820> our<00:00:40.030> sticky<00:00:40.539> pistons<00:00:41.019> redstone

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570 
need it our sticky pistons redstone

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:45.810 
need it our sticky pistons redstone
torches<00:00:43.570> redstone<00:00:44.429> pressure<00:00:45.429> plates

redstone repeaters bucket of lava and a

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:52.110 
redstone repeaters bucket of lava and a
building<00:00:50.559> material<00:00:50.679> I<00:00:51.129> prefer<00:00:51.519> a<00:00:51.760> smooth

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:52.120 
building material I prefer a smooth

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:54.540 
building material I prefer a smooth
stone<00:00:52.420> because<00:00:52.899> it<00:00:52.929> hides<00:00:53.469> the<00:00:53.620> pressure

00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:54.550 
stone because it hides the pressure

00:00:54.550 --> 00:00:57.299 
stone because it hides the pressure
plates<00:00:55.179> better<00:00:55.480> and<00:00:55.780> stairs<00:00:56.739> if<00:00:57.070> you<00:00:57.190> would

00:00:57.299 --> 00:00:57.309 
plates better and stairs if you would

00:00:57.309 --> 00:01:00.360 
plates better and stairs if you would
like<00:00:57.489> to<00:00:57.730> hide<00:00:58.120> them<00:00:58.300> even<00:00:58.629> better<00:00:58.839> so<00:00:59.829> first

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:00.370 
like to hide them even better so first

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:05.850 
like to hide them even better so first
off<00:01:00.609> you<00:01:01.409> want<00:01:02.409> to<00:01:02.559> make<00:01:02.679> a<00:01:03.989> pitch<00:01:04.989> with<00:01:05.710> the

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:05.860 
off you want to make a pitch with the

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:08.970 
off you want to make a pitch with the
dimensions<00:01:06.280> like<00:01:06.430> this<00:01:06.900> got<00:01:07.900> one<00:01:08.140> two<00:01:08.500> three

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:08.980 
dimensions like this got one two three

00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:13.170 
dimensions like this got one two three
four<00:01:09.400> five<00:01:09.780> four<00:01:10.780> five<00:01:10.810> six<00:01:11.530> seven<00:01:11.890> eight<00:01:12.220> nine

ten<00:01:13.740> ten<00:01:14.740> by<00:01:15.010> three<00:01:15.280> and<00:01:15.700> one<00:01:16.330> one<00:01:16.570> the<00:01:16.840> end<00:01:16.990> and

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
ten ten by three and one one the end and

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:20.760 
ten ten by three and one one the end and
one<00:01:18.610> deep<00:01:18.850> obviously<00:01:19.480> so<00:01:20.140> you<00:01:20.170> put<00:01:20.650> the

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:20.770 
one deep obviously so you put the

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:25.860 
one deep obviously so you put the
pistons<00:01:21.160> right<00:01:21.400> here<00:01:21.760> and<00:01:24.690> behind<00:01:25.690> the

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:25.870 
pistons right here and behind the

00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:31.010 
pistons right here and behind the
pistons<00:01:26.290> you'll<00:01:26.710> put<00:01:27.070> redstone<00:01:27.910> repeaters

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:37.140 

just<00:01:32.020> like<00:01:32.260> this<00:01:33.840> next<00:01:34.840> you<00:01:35.500> put<00:01:36.150> redstone

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:37.150 
just like this next you put redstone

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:45.750 
just like this next you put redstone
like<00:01:37.630> that<00:01:37.870> and<00:01:40.380> like<00:01:41.380> this<00:01:41.440> and<00:01:43.920> you<00:01:44.920> go<00:01:45.580> down

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:45.760 
like that and like this and you go down

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:51.510 
like that and like this and you go down
here<00:01:46.120> and<00:01:46.290> put<00:01:48.510> torches<00:01:49.510> like<00:01:49.900> this<00:01:50.470> and<00:01:50.980> for

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:51.520 
here and put torches like this and for

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:53.610 
here and put torches like this and for
the<00:01:51.580> dimensions<00:01:52.060> of<00:01:52.210> this<00:01:52.450> you<00:01:52.960> dig<00:01:53.290> three

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:53.620 
the dimensions of this you dig three

00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:57.360 
the dimensions of this you dig three
down<00:01:53.830> and<00:01:54.160> two<00:01:55.410> right<00:01:56.410> little<00:01:56.770> two<00:01:57.010> behind

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:57.370 
down and two right little two behind

00:01:57.370 --> 00:01:59.100 
down and two right little two behind
where<00:01:57.880> the<00:01:57.970> pressure<00:01:58.180> plate<00:01:58.480> will<00:01:58.510> be<00:01:58.840> and

00:01:59.100 --> 00:01:59.110 
where the pressure plate will be and

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:01.950 
where the pressure plate will be and
it's<00:01:59.800> three<00:02:00.160> by<00:02:00.310> three<00:02:00.640> square<00:02:00.670> and<00:02:01.450> one<00:02:01.750> right

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:01.960 
it's three by three square and one right

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:05.430 
it's three by three square and one right
here<00:02:02.260> and<00:02:02.440> go<00:02:03.040> three<00:02:03.340> over<00:02:03.700> two<00:02:04.600> over<00:02:04.630> my<00:02:05.260> bad

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:05.440 
here and go three over two over my bad

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:06.930 
here and go three over two over my bad
and<00:02:05.680> then<00:02:06.070> make<00:02:06.250> it<00:02:06.280> three<00:02:06.550> by<00:02:06.670> three<00:02:06.910> square

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:06.940 
and then make it three by three square

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:09.930 
and then make it three by three square
with<00:02:07.450> the<00:02:07.630> torch<00:02:08.610> okay

00:02:09.930 --> 00:02:09.940 
with the torch okay

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:12.729 
with the torch okay
so<00:02:10.509> next<00:02:11.019> you<00:02:11.470> will

00:02:12.729 --> 00:02:12.739 
so next you will

00:02:12.739 --> 00:02:15.369 
so next you will
put<00:02:13.310> redstone<00:02:13.670> right<00:02:14.150> here<00:02:14.599> here<00:02:14.900> here<00:02:15.260> and

00:02:15.369 --> 00:02:15.379 
put redstone right here here here and

00:02:15.379 --> 00:02:21.330 
put redstone right here here here and
then<00:02:16.069> make<00:02:16.909> a<00:02:16.939> trail<00:02:17.709> all<00:02:18.709> the<00:02:18.769> way<00:02:19.390> back<00:02:20.390> here

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:21.340 
then make a trail all the way back here

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:24.009 
then make a trail all the way back here
connecting<00:02:22.340> to<00:02:22.640> that<00:02:22.760> torch<00:02:23.150> and<00:02:23.450> it<00:02:23.659> will<00:02:23.810> not

00:02:24.009 --> 00:02:24.019 
connecting to that torch and it will not

00:02:24.019 --> 00:02:26.259 
connecting to that torch and it will not
work<00:02:24.230> if<00:02:24.439> you<00:02:24.560> do<00:02:24.709> that<00:02:24.969> because<00:02:25.969> it<00:02:26.090> needs

00:02:26.259 --> 00:02:26.269 
work if you do that because it needs

00:02:26.269 --> 00:02:29.530 
work if you do that because it needs
connect<00:02:26.689> to<00:02:26.840> that<00:02:27.010> torch<00:02:28.010> so<00:02:28.519> make<00:02:29.209> it<00:02:29.359> like

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:29.540 
connect to that torch so make it like

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:34.800 
connect to that torch so make it like
that<00:02:29.840> and<00:02:31.269> also<00:02:32.269> put<00:02:32.659> redstone<00:02:33.079> right<00:02:33.739> there

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:34.810 
that and also put redstone right there

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:41.910 
that and also put redstone right there
so<00:02:35.810> and<00:02:36.170> then<00:02:37.040> you<00:02:37.519> put<00:02:37.790> your<00:02:38.799> that<00:02:39.799> your

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:41.920 
so and then you put your that your

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:45.250 
so and then you put your that your
pressure<00:02:42.920> plates<00:02:43.250> right<00:02:43.430> there<00:02:43.670> and<00:02:44.109> it<00:02:45.109> will

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:45.260 
pressure plates right there and it will

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:52.920 
pressure plates right there and it will
close<00:02:45.730> but<00:02:46.730> then<00:02:47.109> you<00:02:48.519> also<00:02:49.519> need<00:02:49.879> to<00:02:50.379> put<00:02:51.379> your

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:52.930 
close but then you also need to put your

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:56.319 
close but then you also need to put your
smooth<00:02:53.930> stone<00:02:54.200> right<00:02:54.409> there<00:02:54.620> and<00:02:55.090> your<00:02:56.090> lava

00:02:56.319 --> 00:02:56.329

they won't know that something's up and
you<00:03:16.189> want<00:03:16.370> to<00:03:16.549> destroy<00:03:17.269> these<00:03:17.510> so<00:03:18.139> it<00:03:18.409> looks

you want to destroy these so it looks

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:21.490 
you want to destroy these so it looks

00:03:21.490 --> 00:03:21.500 
better and they won't know there's

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:23.920

to put stairs right here because it

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:30.640 
to put stairs right here because it
hides<00:03:26.540> the<00:03:26.720> pressure<00:03:27.620> plates<00:03:27.979> so<00:03:28.970> it's<00:03:29.439> no<00:03:30.439> one

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:30.650 
hides the pressure plates so it's no one

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:38.560 
hides the pressure plates so it's no one
can<00:03:30.979> find<00:03:31.189> it
