00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
so today we're going to set up a pattern

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:14.840 
so today we're going to set up a pattern
so<00:01:12.810> we're<00:01:13.020> going<00:01:13.140> to<00:01:13.229> tap<00:01:13.439> pattern<00:01:13.920> and<00:01:14.130> when

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
so we're going to tap pattern and when

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:16.249 
so we're going to tap pattern and when
you<00:01:14.939> do<00:01:15.090> that<00:01:15.299> it's<00:01:15.600> actually<00:01:15.930> going<00:01:16.049> to<00:01:16.140> give

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259 
you do that it's actually going to give

next and they will show you an example

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:29.420 
next and they will show you an example
pattern<00:01:27.270> and<00:01:27.450> show<00:01:27.960> you<00:01:28.020> exactly<00:01:28.170> how<00:01:28.770> the

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430 
pattern and show you exactly how the

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:31.670 
pattern and show you exactly how the
pattern<00:01:29.700> system<00:01:30.270> works<00:01:30.509> so<00:01:31.380> when<00:01:31.530> you're

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680 
pattern system works so when you're

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:33.230 
pattern system works so when you're
ready<00:01:31.860> to<00:01:32.009> draw<00:01:32.220> your<00:01:32.310> own<00:01:32.400> pattern<00:01:32.850> you<00:01:33.119> want

ready to draw your own pattern you want

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:35.060 
ready to draw your own pattern you want
to<00:01:33.360> tap<00:01:33.540> next<00:01:33.990> and<00:01:34.110> we're<00:01:34.619> going<00:01:34.740> to<00:01:34.770> draw<00:01:35.009> a

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070 
to tap next and we're going to draw a

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:37.100 
to tap next and we're going to draw a
pattern<00:01:35.340> here<00:01:35.729> and<00:01:35.880> you're<00:01:36.540> going<00:01:36.689> to<00:01:36.750> have<00:01:36.960> to

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.110 
pattern here and you're going to have to

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:40.039 
pattern here and you're going to have to
connect<00:01:37.439> at<00:01:37.590> least<00:01:37.770> four<00:01:38.310> dots<00:01:38.759> so<00:01:39.630> we've

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:40.049 
connect at least four dots so we've

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:42.440
