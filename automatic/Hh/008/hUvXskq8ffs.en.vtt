based<00:04:44.330> on<00:04:44.570> that<00:04:45.080> that<00:04:45.800> area<00:04:46.640> of<00:04:46.940> field<00:04:47.240> so<00:04:48.100> you

00:04:49.090 --> 00:04:49.100 
based on that that area of field so you

00:04:49.100 --> 00:04:51.760 
based on that that area of field so you
can<00:04:49.310> be<00:04:49.430> sure<00:04:49.700> to<00:04:50.060> expect<00:04:50.660> Gears<00:04:50.960> of<00:04:51.020> War<00:04:51.140> 1

00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:51.770

00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:46.410 
really good feel about it they will

00:05:46.410 --> 00:05:48.620 
really good feel about it they will
probably<00:05:46.650> try<00:05:47.040> to<00:05:47.100> change<00:05:47.520> and<00:05:47.820> get<00:05:48.000> back<00:05:48.300> to
