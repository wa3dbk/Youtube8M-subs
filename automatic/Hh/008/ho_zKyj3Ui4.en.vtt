00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:28.160
 open the box 

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:28.160
 we also have the phone that we see 

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:40.920
 then we have a warranty card 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:45.390

 usb micro usb for the attack and start up 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:01:00.629

00:00:56.780 --> 00:01:04.920
 micro usb we said this is it 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:08.369

 has a height of 124 mm one 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:35.729
 thickness of 11,000 2 mm so I have a 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:40.560
 a little bit too often but not that much 

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:43.409

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:48.770
 not even heavy we have pin androgens 

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:53.780

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:56.359
 ram memory is 512 megabytes 

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:59.090

 internal is 4 gb expandable through 

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:04.700
 microsd 

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:07.239
 the internal battery and 1730 for milian 

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:13.040
 then we all have wifi bluetooth 

00:02:07.239 --> 00:02:15.810
 and usb to casey dpa and umts edge e 

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:20.260
 whatever else 

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:27.000
 the screen is 4 inch tft 800 

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:33.580
 pixel e per e 480 and then presents one 

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:35.940
 camera let's say front that is this 

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:39.670
 here along with the rookie pavilion from 

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:44.530
 headset with the keys back the key 

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:46.780
 home is the let's say button for options 

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:52.120
 while later we have one 

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:54.370
 camera with led flash that has a 

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:56.980
 precisely 5 megapixel resolution e 

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:59.230
 we also have the speaker we go to 

00:02:56.980 --> 00:03:01.570
 see then the upper side we have 

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:04.180
 present the power button and the 

00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:06.810
 jack of three and a half on the right side 

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:10.420
 we have the barbell for the volume 

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:15.720
 below we have nothing but it 

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:18.400
 unlock to go and open the phone 

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:21.370
 where inside we have precisely microsd 

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:26.530
 yes but in normal format and battery from 

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:32.130
 1730 milian peril as mentioned above and on 

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:42.510
 left hand side we have the 

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:47.110
 I would say that the USB input is good for that 

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:51.070
 this is unboxing and all of course 

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:55.830
 I would say that we leave the faculty of 

00:03:51.070 --> 00:03:59.860
 try the phone these days e 

00:03:55.830 --> 00:04:02.410
 we say that hoping that the item goes 

00:03:59.860 --> 00:04:05.320
 better in the coming days we can do 

00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:08.130
 an interesting video test for all 

00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:13.980
