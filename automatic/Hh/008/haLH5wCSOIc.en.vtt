00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
when I first heard about this I was like

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:06.679 
when I first heard about this I was like
what<00:01:03.120> kind<00:01:03.390> of<00:01:03.480> a<00:01:03.660> sick<00:01:04.110> twisted<00:01:05.070> person<00:01:05.689> would

00:01:06.679 --> 00:01:06.689 
what kind of a sick twisted person would

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:08.750 
what kind of a sick twisted person would
invent<00:01:07.080> something<00:01:07.320> like<00:01:07.530> this<00:01:07.920> it's<00:01:08.520> like

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:08.760 
invent something like this it's like

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:11.030 
invent something like this it's like
something<00:01:09.150> out<00:01:09.299> of<00:01:09.360> you<00:01:09.840> know<00:01:09.960> John<00:01:10.380> Holdren

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
something out of you know John Holdren

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:14.179 
something out of you know John Holdren
or<00:01:11.340> is<00:01:11.490> he<00:01:11.700> killing<00:01:11.970> manuals<00:01:12.540> wet<00:01:12.960> dream<00:01:13.500> it's

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189 
or is he killing manuals wet dream it's

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:16.820 
or is he killing manuals wet dream it's
like<00:01:14.490> Silence<00:01:15.090> of<00:01:15.270> the<00:01:15.330> Lambs<00:01:15.509> meets<00:01:16.350> Star

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
like Silence of the Lambs meets Star

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:19.820 
like Silence of the Lambs meets Star
Trek<00:01:17.250> so<00:01:18.180> far<00:01:18.479> I<00:01:18.720> think<00:01:18.840> it's<00:01:19.020> just<00:01:19.290> a<00:01:19.409> model

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830 
Trek so far I think it's just a model

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:21.980 
Trek so far I think it's just a model
but<00:01:20.009> this<00:01:20.130> is<00:01:20.250> how<00:01:20.369> it<00:01:20.549> would<00:01:20.700> work<00:01:20.810> they<00:01:21.810> would

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
but this is how it would work they would

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:24.590 
but this is how it would work they would
put<00:01:22.229> 24<00:01:22.890> people<00:01:23.159> on<00:01:23.520> this<00:01:23.729> roller<00:01:24.060> coaster

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
put 24 people on this roller coaster

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:27.230 
put 24 people on this roller coaster
which<00:01:24.840> would<00:01:24.990> go<00:01:25.200> up<00:01:25.470> then<00:01:26.430> down<00:01:26.460> and<00:01:27.119> then

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
which would go up then down and then

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:29.270 
which would go up then down and then
through<00:01:27.479> these<00:01:27.630> spirals<00:01:28.320> which<00:01:28.920> is<00:01:29.100> where

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:29.280 
through these spirals which is where

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:31.999 
through these spirals which is where
your<00:01:29.430> brain<00:01:29.729> gets<00:01:30.030> deprived<00:01:30.450> of<00:01:30.630> oxygen<00:01:31.009> so

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:32.009 
your brain gets deprived of oxygen so

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:34.910 
your brain gets deprived of oxygen so
you<00:01:32.070> go<00:01:32.400> from<00:01:32.670> looking<00:01:33.030> like<00:01:33.090> this<00:01:33.890> to<00:01:34.890> this

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920 
you go from looking like this to this

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:41.179 
you go from looking like this to this
half<00:01:35.670> brain-dead<00:01:36.210> to<00:01:37.049> this<00:01:38.479> fully<00:01:39.500> dead<00:01:40.500> like

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:41.189 
half brain-dead to this fully dead like

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:43.700 
half brain-dead to this fully dead like
I<00:01:41.310> said<00:01:41.579> it's<00:01:42.119> basically<00:01:42.540> a<00:01:42.659> depopulation<00:01:43.470> a

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:43.710 
I said it's basically a depopulation a

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:45.350 
I said it's basically a depopulation a
sweat<00:01:43.979> dream<00:01:44.250> but<00:01:44.670> it's<00:01:44.820> not<00:01:44.970> actually<00:01:45.329> very

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:45.360 
sweat dream but it's not actually very

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:47.810 
sweat dream but it's not actually very
practical<00:01:45.780> do<00:01:46.290> you<00:01:46.380> have<00:01:46.500> to<00:01:46.649> load<00:01:46.890> 24<00:01:47.610> people

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:47.820 
practical do you have to load 24 people

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:50.210 
practical do you have to load 24 people
up<00:01:48.149> on<00:01:48.329> this<00:01:48.509> roller<00:01:48.780> coaster<00:01:48.869> a<00:01:49.470> lot<00:01:50.100> of

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:50.220 
up on this roller coaster a lot of

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:51.649 
up on this roller coaster a lot of
people<00:01:50.460> probably<00:01:50.670> wouldn't<00:01:51.030> want<00:01:51.329> to<00:01:51.420> die

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:51.659 
people probably wouldn't want to die

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:54.740 
people probably wouldn't want to die
that<00:01:51.990> way<00:01:52.200> I<00:01:52.530> have<00:01:52.710> a<00:01:52.740> feeling<00:01:53.420> how<00:01:54.420> do<00:01:54.479> you<00:01:54.600> get

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750 
that way I have a feeling how do you get

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:56.209 
that way I have a feeling how do you get
people<00:01:54.869> to<00:01:55.079> get<00:01:55.200> on<00:01:55.320> a<00:01:55.350> roller<00:01:55.590> coaster<00:01:55.710> like

6oh can you imagine like taking all
these<00:02:15.120> old<00:02:16.099> Alzheimer's<00:02:17.099> and<00:02:17.370> cancer

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:17.780 
these old Alzheimer's and cancer

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:20.690 
these old Alzheimer's and cancer
patients<00:02:18.780> and<00:02:18.989> and<00:02:19.489> getting<00:02:20.489> him<00:02:20.580> on<00:02:20.670> a

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:20.700 
patients and and getting him on a

patients and and getting him on a
rollercoaster<00:02:21.090> I<00:02:21.510> mean<00:02:21.659> that<00:02:21.950> in<00:02:22.950> and<00:02:23.129> of

00:02:23.149 --> 00:02:23.159 
rollercoaster I mean that in and of

00:02:23.159 --> 00:02:25.339 
rollercoaster I mean that in and of
itself<00:02:23.280> might<00:02:23.940> prove<00:02:24.269> to<00:02:24.450> be<00:02:24.480> difficult<00:02:25.230> from

00:02:25.339 --> 00:02:25.349 
itself might prove to be difficult from

00:02:25.349 --> 00:02:27.979 
itself might prove to be difficult from
a<00:02:25.470> logistics<00:02:26.099> point<00:02:26.370> of<00:02:26.489> view<00:02:26.700> I<00:02:26.989> seriously

00:02:27.979 --> 00:02:27.989 
a logistics point of view I seriously

00:02:27.989 --> 00:02:29.479 
a logistics point of view I seriously
don't<00:02:28.230> think<00:02:28.349> that<00:02:28.739> there's<00:02:28.950> gonna<00:02:29.099> be<00:02:29.190> a<00:02:29.280> very

00:02:29.479 --> 00:02:29.489 
don't think that there's gonna be a very

00:02:29.489 --> 00:02:31.640 
don't think that there's gonna be a very
high<00:02:29.640> demand<00:02:30.000> for<00:02:30.269> this<00:02:30.390> I<00:02:30.659> mean<00:02:31.290> this<00:02:31.500> is

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:31.650 
high demand for this I mean this is

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:33.530 
high demand for this I mean this is
really<00:02:32.010> you<00:02:32.280> know<00:02:32.310> like<00:02:32.610> some<00:02:32.879> kind<00:02:33.120> of<00:02:33.209> horror

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:33.540 
really you know like some kind of horror

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:35.899 
really you know like some kind of horror
machine<00:02:34.200> but<00:02:34.799> I<00:02:34.829> was<00:02:35.010> curious<00:02:35.280> about<00:02:35.489> the<00:02:35.700> guy

00:02:35.899 --> 00:02:35.909 
machine but I was curious about the guy

00:02:35.909 --> 00:02:39.289 
machine but I was curious about the guy
you<00:02:36.540> Leona's<00:02:37.170> or<00:02:37.349> Bono's<00:02:38.280> and<00:02:38.549> so<00:02:38.940> i<00:02:38.970> went<00:02:39.180> to

artistic<00:06:11.070> statement<00:06:11.850> and<00:06:12.090> I<00:06:12.240> don't<00:06:12.330> really

00:06:12.680 --> 00:06:12.690 
artistic statement and I don't really
