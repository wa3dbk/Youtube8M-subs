00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:14.549
 well prepared this match because we have 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:16.560
 won this match before playing but 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:48.929
 now clear but we called them 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:50.460
 things on ie the bad guys but I think 

00:00:48.929 --> 00:00:51.570
 that the first match we were not 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:53.879
 in it we did not show the real face 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:55.469
 in addition with a field that is a bit 

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:58.079
 difficult to flap we could not 

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:59.550
 practice football now com 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:00.690
 Thursday on the on the second half time we 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:02.249
 had the real face of the deal is 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:03.269
 true face of yesteryear who played in league 

00:01:02.249 --> 00:01:04.730
 champions who won at 

00:01:03.269 --> 00:01:06.720
 champions that comes so far 

00:01:04.730 --> 00:01:09.150
 and then we did the right thing 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:11.310
 we were led to score we managed to come back 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:14.010
 unfortunately he equalized us then 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:16.260
 it ended in penalty we won 

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:17.370
 so that's fine for us 

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:19.740
 by at least one victory we have 

00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:21.750
 saved the honor to represent the 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:23.010
 algeria set and that's all 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:24.000
 a country so I think that's a 

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:27.000
 good thing what we managed to do 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:33.030
 what we have to tromelin well concentrated 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:51.600

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:55.310
