know here we're keeping the lot of the
carpentry<00:01:29.280> marks<00:01:29.780> it's<00:01:30.780> very<00:01:31.050> low<00:01:31.170> pressure

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.500 
carpentry marks it's very low pressure

carpentry marks it's very low pressure
blasting<00:01:33.259> you<00:01:34.259> can<00:01:34.440> see<00:01:34.649> here<00:01:34.890> the<00:01:36.410> Carpenters

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:37.410 
blasting you can see here the Carpenters

00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:44.020 
blasting you can see here the Carpenters
marks<00:01:37.770> very<00:01:38.039> sharp<00:01:38.399> and<00:01:38.910> clear<00:01:39.179> marks

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:44.030 

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:46.450 

blasting<00:01:45.030> is<00:01:45.119> not<00:01:45.270> damaging<00:01:45.659> those<00:01:45.840> at<00:01:46.050> all

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:46.460 
blasting is not damaging those at all

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:51.169 
blasting is not damaging those at all
and<00:01:47.460> I<00:01:47.580> was<00:01:47.700> set<00:01:47.880> of<00:01:48.000> them<00:01:48.179> here<00:01:49.819> to<00:01:50.819> see<00:01:51.000> them

00:01:51.169 --> 00:01:51.179 
and I was set of them here to see them

00:01:51.179 --> 00:01:55.639 
and I was set of them here to see them
marks<00:01:53.060> and<00:01:54.060> the

00:01:55.639 --> 00:01:55.649 
marks and the

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:58.530 
marks and the
adjoining<00:01:56.429> months

adjoining months

00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:04.140 
adjoining months
and<00:01:59.230> those<00:01:59.470> are<00:02:01.890> clear<00:02:02.890> evidence<00:02:03.340> of<00:02:03.550> the<00:02:03.910> fact

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:04.150 
and those are clear evidence of the fact

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:05.790 
and those are clear evidence of the fact
that<00:02:04.210> the<00:02:04.450> the<00:02:04.840> blasting<00:02:05.320> actually<00:02:05.620> looks

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:05.800 
that the the blasting actually looks

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:08.130 
that the the blasting actually looks
after<00:02:05.950> a<00:02:06.130> timber<00:02:06.460> very<00:02:06.640> nicely<00:02:06.820> you<00:02:07.660> will<00:02:07.900> get

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:08.140 
after a timber very nicely you will get

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:11.250 
after a timber very nicely you will get
a<00:02:08.410> certain<00:02:09.250> amount<00:02:09.580> of<00:02:09.899> edging<00:02:10.899> into<00:02:11.080> the

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:11.260 
a certain amount of edging into the

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:15.570 
a certain amount of edging into the
timber<00:02:12.720> if<00:02:13.720> fortenberry<00:02:14.260> soft<00:02:14.530> but<00:02:15.340> again

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:15.580 
timber if fortenberry soft but again

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:19.940 
timber if fortenberry soft but again
here<00:02:16.980> this<00:02:17.980> is<00:02:18.190> very<00:02:18.370> clearly<00:02:19.360> with<00:02:19.660> this

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:19.950 
here this is very clearly with this

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:35.100 
here this is very clearly with this
little<00:02:20.950> or<00:02:21.070> no<00:02:21.220> etching<00:02:21.670> in<00:02:22.000> timber<00:02:33.930> these<00:02:34.930> are

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:35.110 
little or no etching in timber these are

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:42.200 
little or no etching in timber these are
all<00:02:35.170> being<00:02:35.410> blasted<00:02:35.680> off<00:02:39.720> quite<00:02:40.720> clean<00:02:41.080> flat

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:42.210 
all being blasted off quite clean flat

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:44.400 
all being blasted off quite clean flat
the<00:02:43.210> only<00:02:43.390> time<00:02:43.600> when<00:02:43.780> you<00:02:43.870> really<00:02:44.140> get<00:02:44.260> any

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:44.410 
the only time when you really get any

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:48.390 
the only time when you really get any
etching<00:02:44.830> in<00:02:44.980> them<00:02:45.130> is<00:02:45.660> if<00:02:46.660> the<00:02:47.620> timber<00:02:48.070> itself

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:48.400 
etching in them is if the timber itself

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:51.570 
etching in them is if the timber itself
is<00:02:48.550> very<00:02:48.760> soft<00:02:49.000> and<00:02:49.560> this<00:02:50.560> is<00:02:50.740> quite<00:02:51.010> old<00:02:51.190> soft

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:51.580 
is very soft and this is quite old soft

00:02:51.580 --> 00:03:03.020 
is very soft and this is quite old soft
timber<00:02:52.000> again<00:02:52.420> you<00:02:52.540> can<00:02:52.660> see<00:02:52.900> the<00:02:53.080> saw<00:02:53.620> marks

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:03.030 

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:05.430 

so<00:03:04.030> it<00:03:04.150> just<00:03:04.300> gives<00:03:04.420> you<00:03:04.570> a<00:03:04.630> feel<00:03:04.900> for<00:03:04.930> the<00:03:05.260> fact

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:05.440 
so it just gives you a feel for the fact

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:08.210 
so it just gives you a feel for the fact
that<00:03:05.530> the<00:03:05.820> the<00:03:06.820> actual<00:03:07.090> blasting<00:03:07.570> process

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:08.220 
that the the actual blasting process

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:11.880 
that the the actual blasting process
does<00:03:09.220> not<00:03:09.640> damage<00:03:09.910> the<00:03:10.209> timber<00:03:10.739> anything<00:03:11.739> that

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:11.890 
does not damage the timber anything that

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:14.610 
does not damage the timber anything that
damages<00:03:12.280> the<00:03:12.340> timber<00:03:12.790> is<00:03:13.170> operators<00:03:14.170> turning

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:14.620 
damages the timber is operators turning

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:17.550 
damages the timber is operators turning
the<00:03:14.680> pressure<00:03:14.890> up<00:03:15.130> too<00:03:15.310> high<00:03:15.660> and<00:03:16.660> we're<00:03:17.320> very

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:17.560 
the pressure up too high and we're very

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:20.130 
the pressure up too high and we're very
very<00:03:17.860> careful<00:03:18.220> not<00:03:18.730> to<00:03:18.790> do<00:03:19.090> that<00:03:19.269> we<00:03:19.810> keep<00:03:19.989> the

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:20.140 
very careful not to do that we keep the

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:22.940 
very careful not to do that we keep the
pressure<00:03:20.350> down<00:03:20.560> as<00:03:20.739> low<00:03:21.010> as<00:03:21.040> we<00:03:21.190> possibly<00:03:21.640> can

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:22.950 
pressure down as low as we possibly can

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:31.179 
pressure down as low as we possibly can
this<00:03:23.950> is<00:03:24.160> a<00:03:24.330> breslav<00:03:25.330> beam<00:03:27.060> over<00:03:28.060> the

00:03:31.179 --> 00:03:31.189 

00:03:31.189 --> 00:03:33.979 

again<00:03:32.189> there's<00:03:32.430> not<00:03:32.549> really<00:03:32.819> very<00:03:33.150> many

00:03:33.979 --> 00:03:33.989 
again there's not really very many

00:03:33.989 --> 00:03:36.140 
again there's not really very many
significant<00:03:34.920> marks<00:03:35.280> in<00:03:35.400> the<00:03:35.519> present<00:03:36.000> beam

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:36.150 
significant marks in the present beam

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:37.309 
significant marks in the present beam
but<00:03:36.390> at<00:03:36.480> least<00:03:36.569> it<00:03:36.750> gives<00:03:36.840> you<00:03:36.989> a<00:03:37.049> feel<00:03:37.290> for

00:03:37.309 --> 00:03:37.319 
but at least it gives you a feel for

00:03:37.319 --> 00:03:42.020 
but at least it gives you a feel for
what<00:03:38.180> can<00:03:39.180> be<00:03:39.209> done<00:03:39.480> we're<00:03:40.140> blasting<00:03:40.519> if<00:03:41.519> you

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:42.030 
what can be done we're blasting if you

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:42.890 
what can be done we're blasting if you
do<00:03:42.150> it<00:03:42.269> carefully

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:42.900 
do it carefully

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:45.140 
do it carefully
again<00:03:43.260> more<00:03:43.500> more<00:03:44.280> marks<00:03:44.610> in<00:03:44.790> the<00:03:44.849> timber

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:45.150 
again more more marks in the timber

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:55.509 
again more more marks in the timber
there<00:03:46.069> so<00:03:47.750> here<00:03:48.750> we<00:03:48.870> go<00:03:49.019> a<00:03:49.049> few<00:03:50.930> big<00:03:51.930> old<00:03:52.109> nails

00:03:55.509 --> 00:03:55.519 

00:03:55.519 --> 00:04:08.899 

still<00:03:56.519> left<00:03:56.700> in<00:04:07.489> just<00:04:08.489> gives<00:04:08.639> you<00:04:08.730> a<00:04:08.790> little

00:04:08.899 --> 00:04:08.909 
still left in just gives you a little

00:04:08.909 --> 00:04:11.750 
still left in just gives you a little
bit<00:04:09.060> of<00:04:09.150> a<00:04:09.239> feel<00:04:09.450> for<00:04:09.750> what<00:04:10.379> can<00:04:10.650> be<00:04:10.799> done<00:04:10.950> with

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:11.760 
bit of a feel for what can be done with

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:15.949 
bit of a feel for what can be done with
careful<00:04:12.209> blasting<00:04:13.519> and<00:04:14.519> this<00:04:14.790> is<00:04:14.970> a<00:04:15.150> kit<00:04:15.930> that

00:04:15.949 --> 00:04:15.959 
careful blasting and this is a kit that

00:04:15.959 --> 00:04:28.100 
careful blasting and this is a kit that
we<00:04:16.229> use<00:04:19.340> and<00:04:22.729> we<00:04:23.729> just<00:04:24.389> have<00:04:24.570> a<00:04:24.599> quick<00:04:24.840> look<00:04:27.110> we

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:28.110 
we use and we just have a quick look we

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:34.490 
we use and we just have a quick look we
have<00:04:32.479> operating<00:04:33.479> pressure<00:04:33.780> here<00:04:34.139> we

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:34.500 
have operating pressure here we

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:38.240 
have operating pressure here we
constantly<00:04:35.280> work<00:04:36.120> the<00:04:36.449> pressure<00:04:37.050> valves<00:04:37.500> and

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:38.250 
constantly work the pressure valves and

00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:42.100 
constantly work the pressure valves and
we<00:04:38.940> have<00:04:39.120> feed<00:04:39.389> valves<00:04:39.930> which<00:04:40.250> allow<00:04:41.250> us<00:04:41.280> to

00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:42.110 
we have feed valves which allow us to

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:45.290 
we have feed valves which allow us to
control<00:04:43.110> the<00:04:43.260> flow<00:04:43.680> and<00:04:44.070> the<00:04:44.460> pressure<00:04:44.669> of<00:04:45.060> the

00:04:45.290 --> 00:04:45.300 
control the flow and the pressure of the

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:50.240 
control the flow and the pressure of the
air<00:04:45.740> supply<00:04:47.570> so<00:04:48.570> we<00:04:48.780> no<00:04:49.349> time<00:04:49.620> do<00:04:49.830> we<00:04:49.919> damage

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:50.250 
air supply so we no time do we damage

00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:55.779 
air supply so we no time do we damage
the<00:04:50.370> timber<00:04:50.669> and<00:04:52.159> these<00:04:53.159> are<00:04:53.370> beams<00:04:54.060> which<00:04:54.419> are

00:04:55.779 --> 00:04:55.789 
the timber and these are beams which are

00:04:55.789 --> 00:04:59.879 
the timber and these are beams which are
very<00:04:56.789> bad<00:04:57.120> leading<00:04:57.479> away<00:04:57.690> by

timbre if you look up here you can see

00:05:08.469 --> 00:05:13.619 
timbre if you look up here you can see
how<00:05:08.650> the<00:05:09.580> timber<00:05:09.909> is<00:05:11.939> almost<00:05:12.939> untouched<00:05:13.419> by

00:05:13.619 --> 00:05:13.629 
how the timber is almost untouched by

00:05:13.629 --> 00:05:19.890 
how the timber is almost untouched by
the<00:05:13.689> blast<00:05:15.030> it's<00:05:16.530> quite<00:05:17.530> first<00:05:18.750> where<00:05:19.750> there

00:05:19.890 --> 00:05:19.900 
the blast it's quite first where there

00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:23.610 
the blast it's quite first where there
have<00:05:20.020> been<00:05:20.310> beetle<00:05:21.330> attacking<00:05:22.330> it<00:05:22.530> so<00:05:23.530> you

00:05:23.610 --> 00:05:23.620 
have been beetle attacking it so you

00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:34.170 
have been beetle attacking it so you
have<00:05:23.740> to<00:05:23.770> be<00:05:23.919> a<00:05:23.949> little<00:05:24.159> bit<00:05:24.250> careful<00:05:32.909> our<00:05:33.909> own

00:05:34.170 --> 00:05:34.180 
have to be a little bit careful our own
