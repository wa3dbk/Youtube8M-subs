that's how I do it and then if you're a

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:27.440 
that's how I do it and then if you're a
herbalist<00:03:25.770> use<00:03:26.190> lifeblood<00:03:26.640> of<00:03:26.760> course<00:03:27.090> and

herbalist use lifeblood of course and
then<00:03:28.200> whenever<00:03:28.560> the<00:03:29.010> target<00:03:29.700> is<00:03:29.850> underneath

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:30.680 
then whenever the target is underneath

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:34.610 
then whenever the target is underneath
