00:00:09.559 --> 00:00:13.410
 let's try the suzuki swift sport 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:15.950
 the sporty version of the utility car 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:15.950
 Japanese 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:34.290
 he was driving the swift sport there 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:36.800
 really enjoy yourself 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:40.170
 not so much because of the thrust of the engine 

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:42.720
 1600 from 136 horses which is not the most 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:43.800
 as angry as for the flat trim and 

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:46.530
 saggy 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:48.269
 the steering is precise enough and for i 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:51.510
 brakes that stop it in spaces 

00:00:48.269 --> 00:00:53.550
 quite reduced but it is the change that there 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:56.220
 has captured for accuracy and 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:58.199
 pleasantness with which it digests any 

00:00:56.220 --> 00:01:00.659
 chin up from climbing more 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:01.230
 violent at constant changes in the middle of the 

00:01:00.659 --> 00:01:03.770
 traffic 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:05.940
 the small lever from the short stroke 

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:08.280
 helps to increase the pleasure of 

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:10.560
 guide between hairpin bends as well as between 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:12.990
 tight curves where the tires complicate 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:15.509
 from the excellent grip it squirts away of a 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:17.700
 the sound is also very fast then there 

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:19.830
 puts his always well in mind 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:21.420
 inside gives the feeling of 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:23.750
 go stronger than you are 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:23.750
 doing 

00:01:25.659 --> 00:01:30.999
 and also in the interior wraparound seat 

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:33.929
 the sports steering wheel and pedals for one 

00:01:30.999 --> 00:01:33.929
 much brighter driving 

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:45.110
 here you see the difference between a suite 

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:46.340
 sport we are trying and the 

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:48.020
 normal version 

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:50.119
 ours looks much more 

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:53.740
 gritty from alloy wheels from 

00:01:50.119 --> 00:01:56.630
 more aggressive mask from the spoiler 

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:59.090
 rear to the front lights with lo 

00:01:56.630 --> 00:02:01.720
 black background and then see the grid 

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:01.720
 sporty 

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:10.410
 same i try to hear you and later 

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:12.450
 and we come to the consumption chapter that it is 

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:14.250
 all in all taking a normal ride 

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:16.770
 does not stray far from that of 

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:20.100
 less written version with the 1200 of 94 

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:21.660
 and finally the price 17,900 euros 

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:23.700
 certainly not very few but 

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:26.440
 however aligned with the competition is 

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:29.280
 a very pleasant car to happen 

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:29.280
 sweeps
