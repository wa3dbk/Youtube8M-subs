00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:31.340 
he's got a 70 free shot so you kind of
would<00:01:29.790> expect<00:01:30.150> it<00:01:30.299> to<00:01:30.390> be<00:01:30.479> a<00:01:30.509> tad<00:01:30.810> better<00:01:30.990> but

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
would expect it to be a tad better but

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:33.080 
would expect it to be a tad better but
just<00:01:31.530> suddenly<00:01:31.920> to<00:01:32.159> finishing<00:01:32.460> I<00:01:32.670> didn't

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.090 
just suddenly to finishing I didn't

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:34.520 
just suddenly to finishing I didn't
really<00:01:33.210> actually<00:01:33.479> find<00:01:34.020> that<00:01:34.170> much<00:01:34.320> of<00:01:34.439> an

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530 
really actually find that much of an

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:35.929 
really actually find that much of an
issue<00:01:34.710> with<00:01:35.070> it<00:01:35.220> a<00:01:35.250> lot<00:01:35.430> the<00:01:35.579> time<00:01:35.759> when<00:01:35.850> I<00:01:35.909> was

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:35.939 
issue with it a lot the time when I was

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:37.520 
issue with it a lot the time when I was
thrown<00:01:36.210> go<00:01:36.390> of<00:01:36.450> him<00:01:36.600> he'd<00:01:37.020> still<00:01:37.290> end<00:01:37.439> up

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.530 
thrown go of him he'd still end up

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:38.899 
thrown go of him he'd still end up
putting<00:01:37.740> in<00:01:37.890> the<00:01:37.979> back<00:01:38.159> of<00:01:38.310> the<00:01:38.369> net<00:01:38.490> I<00:01:38.520> mean<00:01:38.640> I

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:38.909 
putting in the back of the net I mean I

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:41.330 
putting in the back of the net I mean I
his<00:01:39.479> conversion<00:01:39.930> rate<00:01:40.259> for<00:01:40.439> me<00:01:40.560> seemed<00:01:41.070> to<00:01:41.100> be

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 
his conversion rate for me seemed to be

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:44.960 
his conversion rate for me seemed to be
about<00:01:41.520> the<00:01:41.700> same<00:01:41.909> as<00:01:42.259> Aguero<00:01:43.259> Diego<00:01:43.920> Costa<00:01:44.369> sit

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:44.970 
about the same as Aguero Diego Costa sit

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:46.249 
about the same as Aguero Diego Costa sit
like<00:01:45.119> players<00:01:45.420> with<00:01:45.600> really<00:01:45.899> really<00:01:46.110> good

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:46.259 
like players with really really good

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:48.080 
like players with really really good
finishing<00:01:46.619> that<00:01:46.740> I've<00:01:46.860> used<00:01:46.890> so<00:01:47.369> other<00:01:47.939> than

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090 
finishing that I've used so other than

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:50.749 
finishing that I've used so other than
that<00:01:48.149> strength<00:01:49.079> at<00:01:49.290> 66<00:01:50.100> is<00:01:50.220> a<00:01:50.250> little<00:01:50.610> bit

00:01:50.749 --> 00:01:50.759 
that strength at 66 is a little bit

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:52.819 
that strength at 66 is a little bit
disappointing<00:01:51.329> I<00:01:51.450> mean<00:01:51.600> being<00:01:51.780> 5<00:01:52.049> for<00:01:52.229> 10<00:01:52.409> the

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:52.829 
disappointing I mean being 5 for 10 the

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:54.889 
disappointing I mean being 5 for 10 the
the<00:01:53.310> strength<00:01:53.880> can<00:01:54.180> be<00:01:54.210> a<00:01:54.390> little<00:01:54.570> bit<00:01:54.750> of<00:01:54.840> an

00:01:54.889 --> 00:01:54.899 
the strength can be a little bit of an

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:56.420 
the strength can be a little bit of an
issue<00:01:55.020> but<00:01:55.409> as<00:01:55.619> you'll<00:01:55.770> see<00:01:55.950> on<00:01:55.979> that<00:01:56.189> clip

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:56.430 
issue but as you'll see on that clip

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:58.160 
issue but as you'll see on that clip
there<00:01:56.610> he<00:01:57.000> out<00:01:57.149> strength<00:01:57.420> to<00:01:57.570> play<00:01:57.750> with<00:01:57.960> no

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170 
there he out strength to play with no

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:00.499 
there he out strength to play with no
issue<00:01:58.890> at<00:01:59.100> all<00:01:59.280> the<00:01:59.820> agility<00:02:00.030> is<00:02:00.270> really

00:02:00.499 --> 00:02:00.509 
issue at all the agility is really

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:02.990 
issue at all the agility is really
useful<00:02:00.630> as<00:02:00.960> well<00:02:01.110> makes<00:02:01.860> him<00:02:02.040> very<00:02:02.520> very<00:02:02.729> good

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:03.000 
useful as well makes him very very good

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.209 
useful as well makes him very very good
at<00:02:03.210> doing<00:02:03.960> sort<00:02:04.140> of<00:02:04.229> stuff<00:02:04.469> like<00:02:04.680> this<00:02:04.920> where

00:02:05.209 --> 00:02:05.219 
at doing sort of stuff like this where

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:06.530 
at doing sort of stuff like this where
he's<00:02:05.369> like<00:02:05.460> just<00:02:05.640> bouncing<00:02:06.090> around<00:02:06.119> all<00:02:06.450> over

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:06.540 
he's like just bouncing around all over

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:08.449 
he's like just bouncing around all over
the<00:02:06.810> place<00:02:06.899> and<00:02:07.320> just<00:02:07.710> getting<00:02:07.890> himself<00:02:08.009> onto

00:02:08.449 --> 00:02:08.459 
the place and just getting himself onto

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:10.550 
the place and just getting himself onto
the<00:02:08.610> end<00:02:08.849> of<00:02:09.119> the<00:02:09.420> of<00:02:09.750> the<00:02:09.869> chances<00:02:10.289> he<00:02:10.319> is

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:10.560 
the end of the of the chances he is

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:13.280 
the end of the of the chances he is
making<00:02:10.800> so<00:02:11.220> on<00:02:11.489> top<00:02:11.790> of<00:02:11.849> that<00:02:12.060> it<00:02:12.930> has<00:02:13.080> high

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:13.290 
making so on top of that it has high

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:14.040 
making so on top of that it has high
attacking<00:02:13.770> work

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:16.720 
and a low defensive workrate so he is

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:18.600 
and a low defensive workrate so he is
always<00:02:17.080> involved<00:02:17.920> in<00:02:18.010> your<00:02:18.130> attacks<00:02:18.430> which

stats<00:02:56.170> that<00:02:56.320> are<00:02:56.380> perfect<00:02:56.800> for<00:02:56.860> that<00:02:57.040> to<00:02:57.550> be

00:02:57.720 --> 00:02:57.730 
stats that are perfect for that to be

00:02:57.730 --> 00:03:00.810 
stats that are perfect for that to be
built<00:02:57.970> around<00:02:58.120> it<00:02:58.450> so<00:02:58.690> he<00:02:59.650> won't<00:02:59.920> be<00:03:00.130> too<00:03:00.670> much

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:00.820 
built around it so he won't be too much

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:02.460
