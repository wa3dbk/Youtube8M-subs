00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:49.070 
anyone walking or driving by with the

00:00:49.070 --> 00:01:07.050

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:07.060 

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:12.660 

I<00:01:10.439> think<00:01:11.439> one<00:01:11.649> of<00:01:11.680> the<00:01:11.799> industries<00:01:12.369> that<00:01:12.520> we

00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:12.670 
I think one of the industries that we

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:15.330 
I think one of the industries that we
work<00:01:12.880> the<00:01:13.060> best<00:01:13.329> with<00:01:13.659> is<00:01:14.020> the<00:01:14.500> tax<00:01:14.770> industry

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:15.340 
work the best with is the tax industry

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:18.179 
work the best with is the tax industry
and<00:01:15.549> that's<00:01:16.060> because<00:01:16.539> tax<00:01:16.840> services<00:01:17.439> are<00:01:17.710> one

00:01:18.179 --> 00:01:18.189 
and that's because tax services are one

00:01:18.189 --> 00:01:20.310 
and that's because tax services are one
of<00:01:18.280> those<00:01:18.399> things<00:01:18.670> that<00:01:18.820> you<00:01:18.970> only<00:01:19.270> need<00:01:19.630> three

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:20.320 
of those things that you only need three

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:22.679 
of those things that you only need three
months<00:01:20.619> a<00:01:20.680> year<00:01:20.710> so<00:01:21.520> between<00:01:21.880> January<00:01:22.539> and

00:01:22.679 --> 00:01:22.689 
months a year so between January and

00:01:22.689 --> 00:01:25.109
