down that way he figures that out and
instead<00:02:55.410> of<00:02:55.800> going<00:02:56.100> for<00:02:56.400> a<00:02:56.430> playoff<00:02:56.850> which<00:02:57.150> has

00:02:57.259 --> 00:02:57.269 
instead of going for a playoff which has

00:02:57.269 --> 00:02:58.940 
instead of going for a playoff which has
a<00:02:57.300> chance<00:02:57.600> to<00:02:57.750> miss<00:02:57.989> or<00:02:58.260> going<00:02:58.800> for

00:02:58.940 --> 00:02:58.950

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:00.540 
sucker-punch which he can easily avoid

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:02.960

by<00:03:00.750> going<00:03:00.959> for<00:03:01.110> quick<00:03:01.260> attack<00:03:01.500> or<00:03:01.680> even<00:03:01.709> the<00:03:02.340> SD

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:02.970
