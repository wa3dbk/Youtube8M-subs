00:00:18.089 --> 00:00:18.099 
also see the angles the speed of the

00:00:18.099 --> 00:00:19.800 
also see the angles the speed of the
attack<00:00:18.430> okay<00:00:18.880> so<00:00:19.330> what<00:00:19.480> we're<00:00:19.570> going<00:00:19.660> to<00:00:19.720> be

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:19.810 
attack okay so what we're going to be

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:26.700 
attack okay so what we're going to be
doing<00:00:19.990> is<00:00:20.320> to<00:00:20.529> start<00:00:20.830> a<00:00:23.640> parry<00:00:25.260> knife<00:00:26.260> drill

00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:26.710 
doing is to start a parry knife drill

okay<00:00:26.980> so<00:00:27.520> moose<00:00:27.760> his<00:00:28.240> job<00:00:28.689> is<00:00:29.230> to<00:00:29.500> try<00:00:29.830> to<00:00:29.859> go

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:02.970 

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:07.950 

right<00:01:03.970> now<00:01:04.510> you<00:01:04.540> see<00:01:04.839> how<00:01:06.719> environments<00:01:07.719> play

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:07.960 
right now you see how environments play

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:12.359 
right now you see how environments play
a<00:01:07.990> factor<00:01:09.090> here's<00:01:10.090> something<00:01:10.570> that<00:01:11.369> only

00:01:12.359 --> 00:01:12.369 
a factor here's something that only

00:01:12.369 --> 00:01:13.889 
a factor here's something that only
through<00:01:12.729> live<00:01:12.939> training<00:01:13.450> you<00:01:13.539> could<00:01:13.659> figure

00:01:13.889 --> 00:01:13.899 
through live training you could figure

00:01:13.899 --> 00:01:18.179 
through live training you could figure
out<00:01:14.789> animals<00:01:15.789> trip<00:01:16.060> behind<00:01:16.329> this<00:01:16.979> as<00:01:17.979> soon<00:01:18.130> as

00:01:18.179 --> 00:01:18.189 
out animals trip behind this as soon as

00:01:18.189 --> 00:01:20.490 
out animals trip behind this as soon as
I<00:01:18.250> touched<00:01:18.520> it<00:01:18.640> I<00:01:18.759> realized<00:01:19.119> I<00:01:19.420> had<00:01:19.869> to<00:01:20.170> move<00:01:20.289> up

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:20.500 
I touched it I realized I had to move up

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:23.890 
I touched it I realized I had to move up
to<00:01:20.649> the<00:01:20.740> side<00:01:21.479> I'd<00:01:22.479> seen

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:23.900 
to the side I'd seen

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:27.840 
to the side I'd seen
your<00:01:24.530> environment<00:01:25.190> is<00:01:25.670> a<00:01:25.730> big<00:01:26.150> factor

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:27.850 
your environment is a big factor

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:31.000 
your environment is a big factor
slipping<00:01:28.850> falling<00:01:29.420> tripping<00:01:30.290> over<00:01:30.350> things<00:01:30.680> I

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:31.010 
slipping falling tripping over things I

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:32.620 
slipping falling tripping over things I
remember<00:01:31.760> one<00:01:31.910> of<00:01:31.940> the<00:01:32.060> club's<00:01:32.270> I<00:01:32.420> worked

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:39.710 
too far there's a fire hydrant man I've

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:42.940 
too far there's a fire hydrant man I've
seen<00:01:39.890> people<00:01:40.190> slipped<00:01:40.490> and<00:01:40.760> fall<00:01:41.320> we<00:01:42.320> you<00:01:42.860> know

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:47.840 
new them on them your environment is a

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:51.130 
new them on them your environment is a
huge<00:01:48.310> factor<00:01:49.330> right<00:01:50.330> this<00:01:50.540> is<00:01:50.660> why<00:01:50.780> it's<00:01:50.990> good

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:51.140 
huge factor right this is why it's good

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:53.020 
huge factor right this is why it's good
for<00:01:51.170> you<00:01:51.380> to<00:01:51.470> train<00:01:51.770> as<00:01:52.400> much<00:01:52.670> as<00:01:52.820> possible

00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:56.510 
outside something like this I went here

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:59.080 
outside something like this I went here
I<00:01:56.570> knew<00:01:56.900> that<00:01:57.250> if<00:01:58.250> he<00:01:58.310> would<00:01:58.550> have<00:01:58.670> charged<00:01:58.970> me

00:01:59.080 --> 00:01:59.090 
I knew that if he would have charged me

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:00.730 
I knew that if he would have charged me
and<00:01:59.240> maybe<00:01:59.360> I<00:01:59.450> would<00:01:59.600> a<00:01:59.630> trip<00:01:59.930> it<00:02:00.410> just<00:02:00.590> went

00:02:00.730 --> 00:02:00.740 
and maybe I would a trip it just went

and maybe I would a trip it just went
from<00:02:00.800> standing<00:02:01.430> two<00:02:01.970> on<00:02:02.090> the<00:02:02.210> ground<00:02:02.330> with<00:02:02.540> a

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:02.570 
from standing two on the ground with a

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:05.350 
from standing two on the ground with a
larger<00:02:02.960> attacker<00:02:03.260> okay<00:02:03.950> what<00:02:04.790> I<00:02:04.820> was<00:02:05.000> doing

think<00:02:15.380> what<00:02:15.920> arm<00:02:16.190> is<00:02:16.340> leading<00:02:16.700> if<00:02:16.850> there<00:02:17.000> was

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:17.090 
think what arm is leading if there was

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:18.640 
think what arm is leading if there was
the<00:02:17.180> other<00:02:17.300> arm<00:02:17.480> leading<00:02:17.810> no<00:02:18.170> grab<00:02:18.410> the<00:02:18.500> knife

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:18.650 
the other arm leading no grab the knife
