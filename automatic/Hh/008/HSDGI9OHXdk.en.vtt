 [Music] 

00:00:03.460 --> 00:00:09.230
 hi friends today we are going to learn to play 

00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:12.050
 'impossible mission' in an arrangement 

00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:13.370
 special for guitar in this video you 

00:00:12.050 --> 00:00:15.230
 I'm going to teach the guitar that's going 

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:18.710
 making the base and the one that makes the sun or 

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:20.960
 you like the idea to learn it, we are going to 

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:31.999
 it's the first guitar that we're going to 

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:34.640
 learn where it sounds like that for 

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:39.710
 touch it let's start giving twice 

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:41.660
 in fifth string to the air after 

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:46.860
 we will press in fret three of the fifth 

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:51.230
 rope and fourth string to the air 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:51.230
 and we already have the first part look 

00:00:53.360 --> 00:01:00.600
 now we give again twice in kit 

00:00:56.490 --> 00:01:04.770
 accord to the air and we go to sixth string 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:06.810
 where we press in fret three and you go 

00:01:04.770 --> 00:01:09.540
 t4 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:12.740
 and we already have the whole phrase, look how 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:12.740
 it sounds slowly 

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:29.830
 [Music] 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:32.230
 this is happening again and again 

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:33.760
 throughout the song what you have 

00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:35.620
 what to do is practice it until you 

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:37.820
 come out fluid and take a little bit of 

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:40.820
 speed yes 

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:40.820
 ah 

00:01:45.909 --> 00:01:49.940
 then there is another guitar that goes over 

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:53.630
 of this and do so 

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:55.940
 [Music] 

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:59.070
 l 

00:01:55.940 --> 00:02:00.930
 and well this guitar may seem 

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:03.420
 it's a bit more complicated but it's not 

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:06.090
 so much to touch we are going to place them 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:09.390
 as if it were a minor chord worth 

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:13.800
 with index on fret 1 of the second 

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:16.770
 string and ring fret 2 of the third and 

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:19.890
 the middle finger of glory in 

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:22.500
 fret 2 of the fourth and we will appreciate 

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:24.130
 backward look second third and 

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:27.480
 quarter 

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:27.480
 we have the first sentence 

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:32.490
 now we simply change the position 

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:34.710
 of the fingers we put the index in the 

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:38.070
 fret one of the fourth string and the finger 

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:39.480
 heart in fret 1 of the second and 

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:41.840
 we do the same again 

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:45.640
 [Music] 

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:45.640
 now we raise the index finger 

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:52.400
 and we come to fifth string fret three and 

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:56.950
 fourth air 

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:56.950
 to see, we have it 

00:02:57.610 --> 00:03:02.569
 i 

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:06.390
 all right 

00:03:02.569 --> 00:03:09.629
 easy not then it sounds again so so 

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:12.260
 so so slowly and does the same sentence 

00:03:09.629 --> 00:03:12.260
 But so 

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:18.690
 and 

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:22.020
 and good to touch it we put the index 

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:26.430
 in fret 1 of the second string the 

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:29.700
 heart in fret 2 of the third and the 

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:30.980
 little finger in fret 3 of the first and 

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:32.630
 now we have look 

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:34.520
 [Music] 

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:38.590
 now we just change the little finger 

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:38.590
 by the ring in fret 2 of the first 

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:46.040
 We put in a nut by clicking on 

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:48.819
 fret 1 with finger 1 

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:50.650
 [Music] 

00:03:48.819 --> 00:03:55.030
 and we finish like this from the 

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:58.590
 second and the first to the air 

00:03:55.030 --> 00:04:01.129
 [Music] 

00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:01.129
 and 

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:07.070
 well nothing you already have perfectly 

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:09.140
 two guitars now what are we going to do 

00:04:07.070 --> 00:04:10.670
 is that we're going to play the together you're going to 

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:13.400
 realize that the guitar is going is going to 

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:15.140
 all the time and then the other one makes a 

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:17.150
 he just lets the guitar play 

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:18.750
 base and do it again in solo 

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:42.600
 two 

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:42.600
 [Music] 

00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:54.569

00:04:56.290 --> 00:05:05.889
