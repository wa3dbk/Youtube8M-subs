00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:28.260

fan<00:00:28.560> of<00:00:28.590> the<00:00:28.920> Pokemon<00:00:29.460> movies<00:00:29.820> I<00:00:29.910> think

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:29.939 
fan of the Pokemon movies I think

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:31.970 
fan of the Pokemon movies I think
because<00:00:30.599> I've<00:00:30.720> only<00:00:30.779> seen<00:00:31.140> a<00:00:31.230> couple<00:00:31.260> anyway

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:31.980 
because I've only seen a couple anyway

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:37.060 
because I've only seen a couple anyway
but<00:00:32.880> it's<00:00:33.870> great<00:00:34.110> for<00:00:34.260> keepsakes<00:00:34.770> really<00:00:35.160> I

00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:37.070 
but it's great for keepsakes really I

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:39.560 
but it's great for keepsakes really I
believe<00:00:38.070> so<00:00:38.280> far<00:00:38.489> I<00:00:38.520> think<00:00:38.730> recently<00:00:38.940> just<00:00:39.390> the

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.570 
believe so far I think recently just the

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:45.700 
believe so far I think recently just the
new<00:00:39.870> movie<00:00:42.050> was<00:00:43.730> dirty<00:00:44.730> now<00:00:44.910> the<00:00:44.969> sky<00:00:45.270> warrior

00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:45.710 
new movie was dirty now the sky warrior

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:48.590 
new movie was dirty now the sky warrior
but<00:00:46.710> so<00:00:47.280> far<00:00:47.460> what<00:00:47.610> the<00:00:47.730> first<00:00:47.940> and<00:00:48.210> I'm<00:00:48.329> just

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
but so far what the first and I'm just

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:50.510 
but so far what the first and I'm just
actually<00:00:48.809> just<00:00:49.050> today<00:00:49.530> I<00:00:49.559> ordered<00:00:49.860> Pokemon

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:50.520 
actually just today I ordered Pokemon

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:53.180 
actually just today I ordered Pokemon
and<00:00:50.760> Sam<00:00:50.969> got<00:00:51.120> that<00:00:51.300> just<00:00:51.449> yet<00:00:51.690> but<00:00:52.190> you'll

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
and Sam got that just yet but you'll

00:00:53.190 --> 00:01:00.439 
and Sam got that just yet but you'll
remember<00:00:53.510> the<00:00:54.680> first<00:00:57.050> movie<00:00:59.300> followed<00:01:00.300> by

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:00.449 
remember the first movie followed by

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:06.500 
remember the first movie followed by
sequel<00:01:00.989> you<00:01:01.350> to<00:01:01.590> returns<00:01:04.010> then<00:01:05.010> Pokemon<00:01:05.549> mm<00:01:06.180> no
