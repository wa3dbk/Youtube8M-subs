00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.230
 we know that each one of those berman if each one plays the style that he has and 

00:00:03.230 --> 00:00:06.500
 removed do it well if throughout the year a style 

00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:09.629
 for one more than now the game us novel style jaen 

00:00:09.629 --> 00:00:12.969
 we know perfectly well that it is a team because they want you to base your game on that 

00:00:12.969 --> 00:00:15.729
 in these judges I who do it well knows very well 

00:00:15.729 --> 00:00:18.710
 and that is also thanks to defensive work you have options in attack 

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:21.089
 because he plays very fast up and they have people 

00:00:21.089 --> 00:00:24.199
 rival people who surprised you because Juan antúñez 

00:00:24.199 --> 00:00:27.939
 I believe that we percent have done very well he is very 

00:00:27.939 --> 00:00:29.890
 happy and very attentive to 

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:32.000
 to that defense because we knew 

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.480
 keyes in any play they threw the back to us and the previous pianos diego is 

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:37.080
 very focused on that 

00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:40.020
 As the game goes by, we have been seeing more game domain more 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:42.510
 fluency plus having a ball with more precision we have been arriving more 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:45.510
 up we have failed to make clear goal chances 

00:00:46.330 --> 00:00:49.350
 but well I think that zero-zero leaves the tie completely open 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:52.460
 we have our options very clear in him 

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:54.780
 next Sunday in jaén 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:59.059
 intimate gnc and I think and I hope he leaves the party in the jaén 

00:00:59.059 --> 00:01:02.550
 put to pull higher have more more people 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:06.330
 maybe you will not be up or more will have more your offensive options and that 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:09.060
 because we are going to demand two things from him 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:12.140
 defend just as well as today even better 

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:14.579
 i percent up then this network 

00:01:14.579 --> 00:01:17.609
 is with spaces in the bars give more space because they are going to throw more 

00:01:17.609 --> 00:01:20.530
 up if she knowing how we should win another year 

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:22.520
 on equipment that are tactically 

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:24.750
 modern art defensively 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:28.070
 and look for things with 

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:31.480
 muddy before that endurance of are uprights 

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:36.090
 and good to say expected a difficult team that we understand did not do much 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:36.740
 plus 

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:40.659
 but good melzer but we have not seen that dispersion of what was to be done 

00:01:40.659 --> 00:01:45.600
 for laptop in a bulletin form to the sun and that is a sanam house 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:47.250
 hundred and therefore shabak 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:51.380
 and if it's a shame we tell how you see the only two areas that are no 

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:55.240
 transfer of transplants and well I think the trend is positive 

00:01:56.050 --> 00:01:57.440
 egíbar has tried 

00:01:57.440 --> 00:02:02.180
 the finger the way but we're a lot James ivory and you have to think about 

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:06.830
 in Iran and has raised it is good to stay in between jaén beech over 

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:09.800
 mark goal I think they score a golden goal of the law or anything like that puts us 

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:10.339
 my 

00:02:10.339 --> 00:02:14.269
 - apart is a good team defensively are very ordered that 

00:02:14.269 --> 00:02:17.599
 that are there experienced people from a country is complicated complicated what 

00:02:17.599 --> 00:02:19.219
 they helped at this point 

00:02:19.219 --> 00:02:20.870
 any misunderstanding of 

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:22.959
 the agreement involves the going and another of 

00:02:22.959 --> 00:02:26.379
 we have enough potential to could jaén and 

00:02:26.379 --> 00:02:28.279
 called ten 

00:02:28.279 --> 00:02:30.299
 hansen llull walsh and move it 

00:02:30.299 --> 00:02:31.859
 past booty 

00:02:31.859 --> 00:02:34.929
 noise at the end you can keep the fortune markedly bonanza 

00:02:36.579 --> 00:02:40.199
 loreto nauta also do not join the have not gotten in the goal to zero també 

00:02:40.199 --> 00:02:41.379

 all or because there is an atc citizenship of fashion chains 

00:02:44.779 --> 00:02:49.359
 thanks the real one can get the brand ford a gaza if they mark we have two 

00:02:49.359 --> 00:02:50.149
 options the 

00:02:50.149 --> 00:02:53.370
 I left the kongoli palm behind the cranberry and go 

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:56.310
