00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:18.600
 is an event that accompanied this afternoon 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:20.160
 but this video that will be short and by 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:22.650
 I just want to address one of the 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:25.140
 topics so on the favorite topic that 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:27.689
 as you may already know is the disclosure 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:31.050
 of the new trailer for the witcher 3 with a 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:32.969
 piece of gameplay with 11 however that the 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:35.969
 owner of a trailer had the right to 

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:38.309
 show this trailer of your 23 had me 

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:40.320
 I like it fucking good 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:41.969
 Maybe I'll just let him go to the 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:43.530
 you take a look just to give a 

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:45.660
 look and the link will be on the 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:47.610
 discretion for you if you want 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:49.920
 obvious to take a look like that without 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:51.600
 my voice over beauty is 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:53.850
 first that she would like to ask 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:56.789
 I'm sorry it was to bring a video of 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:58.230
 Today's hickebottom but this subject in 

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:00.750
 twitter three really caught my attention 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:02.280
 so I preferred to bring him than the 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:03.570
 word today so it really is for what 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:05.880
 you understand beauty 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:08.939
 So people, I went and you're going to be there. 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:11.700
 watching the excerpts of the gameplay excerpts 

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:13.590
 of humor is seeing the training of 23 and I 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:16.259
 I have to tell the guys that I putz 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:17.009
 Mega mega happy to have seen something 

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:18.689
 like this 

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:20.460
 I would first like to talk about 

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:22.560
 graphics the graphics guys like you 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:25.290
 you can see that they are magnificent. 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:28.229
 beautiful I thought it was fantastic 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:30.450
 and I do not know if the graph so by 

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:32.909
 least for me the graph of 22 is thus the 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:35.400
 graph of the current generation and I do not 

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:37.799
 I know if the graph of 23 is not going to be the 

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:39.180
 next best graphic chart 

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:40.049
 generation because both it will be well in the 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:41.549
 her start 

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:43.920
 we do not have enough information 

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:46.890
 for that the game will only be in the year 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:48.540
 that comes and also the game is a version 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:50.759
 a little bit at the end the graphics then 

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:53.220
 we are not sure what to eat here 

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:54.689
 the final version of the game still has 

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:56.880
 a lot to see a lot for 

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:59.939
 explore but for now this is the part 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:01.469
 game graph about the history of the game 

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:03.869
 I think it's best not to comment on 

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:04.500
 what the game is going to say can not talk a 

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:05.969
 a little yes 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:08.280
 the game will talk about it on 

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:12.270
 is a type of hunting that as training and 

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:13.230
 mentions in which the spectral beings is the 

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:15.769
 elf 

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:18.000
 they run across the land is capturing 

00:02:15.769 --> 00:02:20.909
 children or other types of beings 

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:23.700
 humans then the game will deal with 

00:02:20.909 --> 00:02:25.290
 This is about the relation that the boy 

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:26.849
 have with this event 

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:28.590
 if you played both previous games 

00:02:26.849 --> 00:02:30.420
 you should finally know the relationship 

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:32.129
 With this event I recommend that you 

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:35.099
 you've seen the other two games beauty 

00:02:32.129 --> 00:02:36.660
 It's the trailer I think is very good I found 

00:02:35.099 --> 00:02:38.580
 very interesting showing all the 

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:41.069
 share the gameplay from the nothingness of 

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:43.799
 playground water I found so far 

00:02:41.069 --> 00:02:45.780
 mermaid in one expected us 

00:02:43.799 --> 00:02:46.620
 had a nice way in the middle of the 

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:48.510
 gameplay 

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:51.060
 but I found it very interesting to hear who 

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:52.290
 finding interesting is what I can 

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:53.849
 speak 

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:56.040
 the combat mode which is what I most 

00:02:53.849 --> 00:02:57.480
 I wanted to see I think it's phenomenal. 

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:59.849
 while it seems that kind of combat 

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:02.760
 dynamic is that you understand me 

00:02:59.849 --> 00:03:04.470
 and you can not be sure yet how 

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:06.959
 It's going to be the fight but for what? 

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:09.090
 demonstrated there is a good fight 

00:03:06.959 --> 00:03:12.269
 dynamic the movement of the characters 

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:14.549
 It's really cool, it's the graphics. 

00:03:12.269 --> 00:03:16.140
 as I said also the legal environment 

00:03:14.549 --> 00:03:18.630
 today it seems fantastic that the environment 

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:20.730
 I live that skull she showed 

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:23.430
 that city that showed the routine well 

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:25.440
 horse I found it all very sup 

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:27.599
 same everything very cool everything very beautiful 

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:31.319
 everything I 've been I think fluid is the 

00:03:27.599 --> 00:03:32.669
 word that would describe the witcher 31 

00:03:31.319 --> 00:03:34.349
 moment everything is going round 

00:03:32.669 --> 00:03:37.230
 quietly knows 

00:03:34.349 --> 00:03:39.510
 it seems that it is an event is 

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:41.579
 seeing there does not seem like a game that 

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:43.549
 all locked in while these are 

00:03:41.579 --> 00:03:46.440
 my impressions about the end of 23 

00:03:43.549 --> 00:03:48.989
 if you want to analyze it a little bit 

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:51.480
 more calm and I can tell you 

00:03:48.989 --> 00:03:52.560
