00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
have to step in but most the time we

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:30.020 
have to step in but most the time we
don't

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030

but she wound up rescue him and going to
an<00:03:06.900> alternate<00:03:07.230> spot<00:03:07.470> which<00:03:07.620> we<00:03:07.769> saw<00:03:07.950> that

00:03:08.119 --> 00:03:08.129 
an alternate spot which we saw that

00:03:08.129 --> 00:03:10.250 
an alternate spot which we saw that
alternate<00:03:08.519> spot<00:03:08.760> so<00:03:09.359> but<00:03:09.659> while<00:03:09.810> we<00:03:09.959> were<00:03:10.049> here

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:10.260 
alternate spot so but while we were here

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:11.750 
alternate spot so but while we were here
I<00:03:10.290> thought<00:03:10.470> what<00:03:10.709> the<00:03:10.739> heck<00:03:10.950> let's<00:03:11.400> put<00:03:11.640> this

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:11.760

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:14.690 
I thought what the heck let's put this
box<00:03:12.000> up<00:03:12.590> there<00:03:13.590> hasn't<00:03:13.739> been<00:03:13.829> a<00:03:13.920> box<00:03:14.220> yet<00:03:14.549> that

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:14.700 
box up there hasn't been a box yet that

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:15.979 
box up there hasn't been a box yet that
I<00:03:14.730> haven't<00:03:14.909> stuck<00:03:15.239> up<00:03:15.420> that<00:03:15.629> a<00:03:15.659> squirrel

00:03:15.979 --> 00:03:15.989 
I haven't stuck up that a squirrel

00:03:15.989 --> 00:03:19.339 
I haven't stuck up that a squirrel
hasn't<00:03:16.910> got<00:03:17.910> into<00:03:18.299> I<00:03:18.329> mean<00:03:18.569> I<00:03:18.599> put<00:03:18.840> boxes<00:03:19.230> up

00:03:19.339 --> 00:03:19.349 
hasn't got into I mean I put boxes up

00:03:19.349 --> 00:03:20.839 
hasn't got into I mean I put boxes up
for<00:03:19.530> birds<00:03:19.919> have<00:03:20.130> a<00:03:20.160> smaller<00:03:20.489> hole<00:03:20.700> the

00:03:20.839 --> 00:03:20.849 
for birds have a smaller hole the

00:03:20.849 --> 00:03:22.190 
for birds have a smaller hole the
squirrels<00:03:21.120> will<00:03:21.269> chew<00:03:21.419> the<00:03:21.540> whole<00:03:21.690> lot<00:03:21.840> bigger

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:22.200 
squirrels will chew the whole lot bigger

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:23.990 
squirrels will chew the whole lot bigger
so<00:03:22.709> they<00:03:22.829> can<00:03:22.980> fit<00:03:23.160> in<00:03:23.250> there<00:03:23.430> so<00:03:23.790> I<00:03:23.819> thought

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:24.000 
so they can fit in there so I thought

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.120 
so they can fit in there so I thought
you<00:03:24.269> know<00:03:24.299> what<00:03:24.510> while<00:03:24.690> we're<00:03:24.840> here<00:03:25.109> we<00:03:25.919> didn't

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:27.470 
you know what while we're here we didn't
use<00:03:26.220> it<00:03:26.340> for<00:03:26.459> the<00:03:26.549> rescue<00:03:26.880> but<00:03:27.090> let's<00:03:27.239> put<00:03:27.389> it

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:27.480 
use it for the rescue but let's put it

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:29.360 
use it for the rescue but let's put it
up<00:03:27.540> and<00:03:27.870> let's<00:03:28.470> give<00:03:28.620> her<00:03:28.680> an<00:03:28.769> alternate<00:03:29.129> spot

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:29.370 
up and let's give her an alternate spot

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:31.940 
up and let's give her an alternate spot
this<00:03:29.579> is<00:03:29.730> a<00:03:29.760> bomb-proof<00:03:30.060> box<00:03:30.810> so<00:03:31.169> maybe<00:03:31.739> next

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:31.950 
this is a bomb-proof box so maybe next
