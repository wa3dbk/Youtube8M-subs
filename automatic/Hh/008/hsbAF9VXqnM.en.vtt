00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.350
 hello and welcome to this 

00:00:01.650 --> 00:00:06.810
 motto real today I show you the mod 

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:10.069
 craft aid eschborners and what he all 

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:10.069
 can have fun 

00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:20.040
 so as you can already see this adds murder 

00:00:17.370 --> 00:00:23.160
 a whole lot of spawning added 

00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:26.070
 that's all about whether it's in minecraft 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:28.670
 really only exists and that is 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:30.960
 basic recipe always so one arranges for it 

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:33.930
 paving stones mossy paving stones 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:35.400
 then for the railway and where 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:37.500
 the glass pane is coming 

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:39.059
 corresponding item leads system 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:41.190
 in accordance with the mob 

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:43.290
 Of course, the whole thing could be murder 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:45.750
 manufacturer's page on planet minecraft dot 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:48.210
 com read link of course in the 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:49.949
 description so i just show you 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:52.050
 very briefly the few monsters the 

00:00:49.949 --> 00:00:53.760
 were added or that 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:55.710
 porn I do not mean monster 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:57.659
 monster stoner so here for example that 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:59.550
 swine stoner is actually clear 

00:00:57.659 --> 00:01:02.190
 Of course, there are quite a few 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:04.260
 take pontida logically or for example 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:07.200
 We now also have the skeleton bonner 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:10.020
 For this we switch to night 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:11.870
 to and here you can see the whole 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:14.220
 of course works the same way 

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:16.380
 then we can do the whole thing for example 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:19.640
 also try on the creepers 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:22.049
 formally still creepers borner like that 

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:23.789
 works of course and for that did 

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:26.789
 is of course intended for those on 

00:01:23.789 --> 00:01:28.469
 do not want to kill your own card 

00:01:26.789 --> 00:01:31.079
 because they just do not like it 

00:01:28.469 --> 00:01:32.490
 then of course this mod is perfect 

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:35.009
 maybe a little bit of resources 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:37.500
 annoying but otherwise works there 

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:39.390
 as well of course in the creative 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:40.920
 inventory that means you could get here 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:42.929
 now the whole spawn 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:44.820
 differ depending on whether one 

00:01:42.929 --> 00:01:47.130
 Of course also romania is used 

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:50.130
 of course, each itself is left 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:52.770
 for example, the iron golems 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:54.539
 Of course, ponor works that way too 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:57.240
 you could decide 

00:01:54.539 --> 00:01:58.170
 so here is the constant okay that is 

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:00.299
 now pretty cool 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:03.960
 Well, we already know the fishermen 

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:05.700
 or here for example for the 

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:07.979
 For example, give it one 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:10.500
 glass bottle that you could use the power 

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:12.390
 So the spot and for example completely for 

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:14.040
 Finally we take the witwer for it 

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:16.850
 Let's fuck off for a while 

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:19.370
 far back like that 

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:23.180
 Of course, that is what happened 

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:25.310
 equal to that already, of course, very great 

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:28.670
 he already cleared us the times 

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:31.190
 whole world on well he should do that 

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:32.900
 I hope now no second I switch 

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:35.300
 Let's have a look at the monster again 

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:37.340
 of course it is a bit 

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:39.200
 packed the theater comes out but that 

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:40.520
 is just the way because you can not stop yet 

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:43.190
 because I do not think so now 

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:44.420
 bad but okay so that's it 

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:45.650
 actually mostly already 

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:47.150
 again I show you now completely 

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:50.570
 short the bat tree 

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:54.500
 you would need it for example if 

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:58.010
 I think that's not in there nee 

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:58.400
 that is not wait but there it is 

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:00.560
 gate 

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:02.360
 you would need stone for that so easy 

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:05.330
 sit down a stone and then you could 

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:08.350
 such little bats so bats 

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:10.400
 of course forces or bats porno 

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:12.230
 but that works now i think 

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:13.760
 not I would have no idea 

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:15.110
 just try it myself I think 

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:17.810
 the murder as I said just cool 

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:19.550
 earn is not like pulling the 

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:20.870
 It's just a perfect solution 

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:23.540
 someone sees it works naturally 

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:25.040
 Also as I said all crafting recipes 

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:27.050
 Of course, you can find it with the mother 

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:28.880
 Exhibitor page link in the description 

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:30.650
 that 's it for the most part 

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:33.460
 actually again from the board review 

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:35.780
 See you now at the installation 

00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:37.880
 so the inventory so at the 

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:41.060
 installation one needs for it minecraft 

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:43.370
 forge and the powerful sport itself 

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:44.840
 First, press the windows button 

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:47.120
 and he will come here like this 

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:49.400
 executive dialogue there one enters 

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:51.770
 percent from tata percent and then presses 

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:54.320
 ok then you go to the point 

00:03:51.770 --> 00:03:57.080
 minecraft folder in the folder and 

00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:59.330
 opens the minecraft point in there 

00:03:57.080 --> 00:04:02.750
 is now a meta calls him 

00:03:59.330 --> 00:04:04.790
 you delete that first out and 

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:07.280
 then you go on to open the fort and 

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:09.620
 takes all files with the metal 

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:12.380
 called for the progress party inside 

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:14.240
 is all over it in the minecraft that 

00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:15.740
 course takes a little bit because 

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:17.870
 the murder itself is relatively large 

00:04:15.740 --> 00:04:20.570
 We will then press research as soon as possible 

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:22.340
 works ok and then that is 

00:04:20.570 --> 00:04:24.560
 whole packed inside then you can the 

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:27.530
 minecraft point already close as well 

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:29.810
 like force.com, you pick up again 

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:30.360
 the bees folder from the front to the 

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:32.879
 window 

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:35.069
 and then goes into the mods folder of 

00:04:32.879 --> 00:04:37.020
 minecraft and then copy it completely 

00:04:35.069 --> 00:04:39.360
 simply not the craft aid bonner 

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:41.669
 just unpack it in there and then 

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:43.229
 should it all work already yes 

00:04:41.669 --> 00:04:44.879
 if there are any problems 

00:04:43.229 --> 00:04:46.949
 then she writes in the comments 

00:04:44.879 --> 00:04:48.840
 I can hopefully help you further 

00:04:46.949 --> 00:04:50.099
 if you liked it gives it 

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:52.110
 a thumbs up 

00:04:50.099 --> 00:04:53.550
 and if we have not done so yet 

00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:54.780
 Of course, I would also like one 

00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:56.789
 very happy 

00:04:54.780 --> 00:04:58.469
 As I said all download links are in 

00:04:56.789 --> 00:04:59.879
 the video description as well as to 

00:04:58.469 --> 00:05:02.490
 the crafting recipes 

00:04:59.879 --> 00:05:05.060
 I'll say it until then stay tuned 

00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:05.060
 and ciao
