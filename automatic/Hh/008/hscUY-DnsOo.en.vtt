 I am not rude and want to know him then which 

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:14.219
 It's your doubt that we 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:17.880
 question why do you know why 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:23.310
 people are fancy at the carnival because it is 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:24.300
 beautiful and is to fill the fights if it falls in the 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:27.449
 ditch 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:34.829
 She did it and Denzel fell for it. 

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:39.360
 I think it's a cool fantasy for me. 

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:43.110
 the last beautiful space you are very 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:46.590
 Funny cool that won 26 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:48.239
 antennas you suck and renato wedge 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:50.730
 are detecting the presence of the 

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:53.489
 enemy is what the carnival is that 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:58.469
 We can have fun and have fun. 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:01:02.190
 alalaÃ´oooo playing we have already played with 

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:05.070
 horse is not who I came to find here 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:06.990

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:09.299
 well where will you get much better 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:12.510
 that's it, I came here because they made me 

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:13.979
 a curious question b saw is because 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:18.060
 during the carnival people are 

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:20.850
 fantasies in halo of this brings us to a 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:23.040
 time very old dream of far 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:25.020
 so you know it was meter feet 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:28.170
 Cabral who discovered brazil by the way 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:30.600
 two months after the carnival looks only from 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:32.729
 beauty was the blic he did that the 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:35.579
 our Portuguese brothers brought 

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:37.710
 Brazil a tradition a joke in 

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:40.590
 that some got dirty 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:42.810
 this type of fault exists until now 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:45.810
 there in Italy many centuries ago 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:49.079
 the famous masked balls came 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:51.869
 it was they who popularized the harlequin 

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:53.010
 He picked up the columbine that has many 

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:56.610
 even marches 

00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:58.650
 talking about him at these parties everybody 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:01.320
 very promptly stated it lows where 

00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:03.090
 Ink spilled on the other and then on to nobody. 

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:05.610
 knows who had planted everything then 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:07.320
 world went fantasized for complicated 

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:09.810
 today people fantasize more 

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:12.330
 different that everyone wants to appear 

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:14.460
 and did you know that fantasies are 

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:17.550
 in the school parade of 

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:19.500
 samba is because it is through them that 

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:22.080
 You'll understand what the school is about. 

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:24.630
 telling them who will tell the story 

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:28.050
 of the plot understood the plot is counted 

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:30.660
 through class every day for this 

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:34.620
