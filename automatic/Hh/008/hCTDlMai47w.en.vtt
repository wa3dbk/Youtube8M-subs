about three hours before I woke up at

00:01:00.219 --> 00:01:03.599 
about three hours before I woke up at
about<00:01:00.550> seven<00:01:01.179> or<00:01:01.269> six<00:01:01.600> a<00:01:02.019> club<00:01:02.379> and<00:01:02.679> I<00:01:03.219> Chinese

all<00:01:08.490> I<00:01:09.490> think<00:01:10.360> it's<00:01:10.509> because<00:01:10.690> i<00:01:11.020> had<00:01:11.170> a

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:11.200 
all I think it's because i had a

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:14.130 
all I think it's because i had a
keylogger<00:01:11.710> on<00:01:12.039> my<00:01:12.280> school<00:01:12.580> that<00:01:12.850> cup<00:01:13.140> and

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:14.140 
keylogger on my school that cup and

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:15.780 
keylogger on my school that cup and
yesterday

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:15.790 
yesterday

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:18.750 
yesterday
first<00:01:16.540> day<00:01:16.780> that<00:01:16.990> is<00:01:17.260> and<00:01:17.560> I<00:01:17.920> locked<00:01:18.430> on<00:01:18.580> my

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:18.760 
first day that is and I locked on my

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:22.740 
first day that is and I locked on my
Warcraft<00:01:19.480> account<00:01:19.720> in<00:01:20.110> school<00:01:21.540> basically<00:01:22.540> I

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:22.750 
Warcraft account in school basically I

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:25.820 
Warcraft account in school basically I
think<00:01:23.170> it's<00:01:23.290> where<00:01:24.070> the<00:01:24.670> key<00:01:24.850> log<00:01:25.030> came<00:01:25.450> from

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830 
think it's where the key log came from

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:31.320 
think it's where the key log came from
catching<00:01:26.830> like<00:01:29.070> my<00:01:30.070> password<00:01:30.610> and<00:01:30.820> sending<00:01:31.180> it

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:31.330 
catching like my password and sending it

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:34.890 
catching like my password and sending it
