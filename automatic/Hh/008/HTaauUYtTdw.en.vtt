so yeah I'm playing a bit of ground work
you're<00:00:53.520> doing<00:00:53.550> for<00:00:53.850> a<00:00:54.210> nuclear<00:00:54.600> in<00:00:54.809> this<00:00:54.930> game

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110 
you're doing for a nuclear in this game

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:56.930 
you're doing for a nuclear in this game
I<00:00:55.140> was<00:00:55.350> I<00:00:55.500> had<00:00:55.680> an<00:00:55.800> awful<00:00:56.160> start<00:00:56.399> again<00:00:56.910> with

this is the second half of the
domination<00:01:03.870> I'm<00:01:04.110> not<00:01:04.260> a<00:01:04.290> big<00:01:04.470> fan<00:01:04.500> of

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619 
domination I'm not a big fan of

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:06.980 
domination I'm not a big fan of
domination<00:01:05.159> as<00:01:05.580> you<00:01:05.760> guys<00:01:05.880> know<00:01:05.939> but<00:01:06.630> using

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
domination as you guys know but using

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:09.740 
domination as you guys know but using
these<00:01:07.350> killstreaks<00:01:07.950> obviously<00:01:08.490> friendly<00:01:09.210> UAV

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750 
these killstreaks obviously friendly UAV

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:11.719 
these killstreaks obviously friendly UAV
cal<00:01:10.049> acuity<00:01:10.260> and<00:01:10.710> the<00:01:11.040> saturn<00:01:11.369> look<00:01:11.520> at<00:01:11.640> all

cal acuity and the saturn look at all

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:13.100 
cal acuity and the saturn look at all
the<00:01:11.820> points<00:01:12.150> you<00:01:12.270> get<00:01:12.420> if<00:01:12.630> you<00:01:12.750> want<00:01:12.900> to<00:01:12.960> level

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
the points you get if you want to level

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:14.750 
the points you get if you want to level
up<00:01:13.290> this<00:01:13.409> is<00:01:13.560> why<00:01:13.680> I'm<00:01:13.799> kind<00:01:14.100> of<00:01:14.189> doing<00:01:14.310> it<00:01:14.520> cuz

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760 
up this is why I'm kind of doing it cuz

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:16.670 
up this is why I'm kind of doing it cuz
I<00:01:14.820> want<00:01:15.030> to<00:01:15.090> level<00:01:15.240> up<00:01:15.450> and<00:01:15.659> get<00:01:16.350> to<00:01:16.470> max

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
I want to level up and get to max

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:19.160 
I want to level up and get to max
prestige<00:01:17.100> as<00:01:17.340> soon<00:01:17.549> as<00:01:17.640> I<00:01:17.700> can<00:01:17.880> really<00:01:18.180> so<00:01:19.080> the

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
prestige as soon as I can really so the

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:20.060 
prestige as soon as I can really so the
best<00:01:19.290> way<00:01:19.409> to<00:01:19.470> do<00:01:19.619> that<00:01:19.650> is<00:01:19.740> obviously

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.070 
best way to do that is obviously

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:22.100 
best way to do that is obviously
playground<00:01:20.520> walk<00:01:20.729> and<00:01:21.299> if<00:01:21.509> you<00:01:21.659> get<00:01:21.780> all<00:01:21.930> these

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
playground walk and if you get all these

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:23.899 
playground walk and if you get all these
points<00:01:22.470> for<00:01:22.590> using<00:01:22.710> these<00:01:23.009> kill<00:01:23.310> streaks<00:01:23.640> and

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909 
points for using these kill streaks and

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:25.940 
points for using these kill streaks and
once<00:01:24.150> you<00:01:24.240> get<00:01:24.360> the<00:01:24.450> vsat<00:01:24.900> you<00:01:25.380> are<00:01:25.530> well<00:01:25.770> away

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
once you get the vsat you are well away

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:27.289 
once you get the vsat you are well away
so<00:01:26.009> once<00:01:26.340> I<00:01:26.460> get<00:01:26.610> the<00:01:26.700> first<00:01:26.850> piece<00:01:27.060> out<00:01:27.240> in

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:27.299 
so once I get the first piece out in

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:29.660 
so once I get the first piece out in
this<00:01:27.360> game<00:01:27.619> it's<00:01:28.619> pretty<00:01:28.829> much<00:01:28.979> game<00:01:29.189> over<00:01:29.220> and

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
this game it's pretty much game over and

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:32.450 
this game it's pretty much game over and
you<00:01:30.210> will<00:01:30.329> see<00:01:30.540> it<00:01:30.780> just<00:01:30.990> it's<00:01:31.350> visa<00:01:32.070> after<00:01:32.340> v

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
you will see it just it's visa after v

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:34.010 
you will see it just it's visa after v
sack<00:01:32.759> so<00:01:32.970> I<00:01:33.000> think<00:01:33.270> end<00:01:33.390> up<00:01:33.479> getting<00:01:33.689> three<00:01:33.869> be

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
sack so I think end up getting three be

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:36.020 
sack so I think end up getting three be
sets<00:01:34.229> before<00:01:34.380> I<00:01:34.530> get<00:01:34.710> the<00:01:35.130> nuclear<00:01:35.520> medal<00:01:35.790> so

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
sets before I get the nuclear medal so

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:37.370 
sets before I get the nuclear medal so
it's<00:01:36.329> a<00:01:36.360> pretty<00:01:36.479> good<00:01:36.689> game<00:01:36.869> I<00:01:36.930> hopefully<00:01:37.290> you

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
it's a pretty good game I hopefully you

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:39.289 
it's a pretty good game I hopefully you

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:24.860 
wouldn't count properly I won't just sit

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:25.900 
wouldn't count properly I won't just sit
in<00:02:24.950> the<00:02:25.010> corner<00:02:25.340> and<00:02:25.370> wait<00:02:25.519> for<00:02:25.670> someone<00:02:25.819> to

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:25.910

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:29.800 
come and but I'd be a bit more cautious
and<00:02:28.370> then<00:02:28.459> you'd<00:02:28.610> end<00:02:28.760> up<00:02:28.819> dying<00:02:29.060> maybe<00:02:29.390> one<00:02:29.660> or

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:29.810 
and then you'd end up dying maybe one or

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:31.479 
and then you'd end up dying maybe one or
two<00:02:29.840> often<00:02:30.319> that's<00:02:30.829> what's<00:02:31.069> there<00:02:31.310> not<00:02:31.430> that

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:35.289 
was the annoying bit for me and getting
that<00:02:33.500> close<00:02:33.709> and<00:02:33.950> then<00:02:34.040> changing<00:02:34.849> my<00:02:35.120> game

00:02:35.289 --> 00:02:35.299 
that close and then changing my game

00:02:35.299 --> 00:02:37.300 
that close and then changing my game
style<00:02:35.599> and<00:02:35.810> ruining<00:02:36.230> it<00:02:36.349> basically<00:02:36.680> so<00:02:36.950> I'd

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:37.310
