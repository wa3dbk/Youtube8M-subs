00:00:21.110 --> 00:00:27.500
 the headless ghost noises in the 

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:30.980
 hallways mysterious inscriptions in 

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:33.440
 walls screams and flying objects 

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:36.650
 these are just a few things that 

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:39.280
 happened in the bole return to the most 

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:42.470
 of England and one of the most 

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:47.360
 Damn the world say that despite 

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:49.670
 of having been built only in 1862 the 

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:52.309
 where the ball and the actor were 

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:55.250
 built had a much more 

00:00:52.309 --> 00:00:58.370
 dating back to the 12th century 

00:00:55.250 --> 00:01:00.650
 legend has it that at that time a monk 

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:03.140
 desperately in love with a 

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:06.070
 novice who lived there but the relationship 

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:09.500
 between them was extremely prohibited 

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:12.830
 but even so they planned to stay 

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:15.710
 together and decided to flee from the place 

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:19.399
 Luck was not by his side and the monk 

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:22.369
 ended up being caught just like his beloved 

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:26.630
 for this reason he was beheaded and she 

00:01:22.369 --> 00:01:29.510
 live until the year 1930, the 

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:31.640
 apparitions were few but after that the 

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:34.400
 thing started getting ugly on the spot 

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:37.369
 when the Rev. laionel foster and his 

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:39.680
 woman lived there they reported having 

00:01:37.369 --> 00:01:40.460
 heard noises in every corner of the 

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:42.710
 House 

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:45.200
 doors that closed and did not open 

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:47.150
 glasses that broke without reason 

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:50.420
 sighting of a man without a head 

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:52.189
 walking around the house and a woman without an arm 

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:55.490
 wandering the corridors 

00:01:52.189 --> 00:01:58.220
 however the scariest was yet to come. 

00:01:55.490 --> 00:02:00.920
 for a time the wife of laionel 

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:03.860
 began to suffer attacks from objects that 

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:06.830
 flew towards him in addition to being 

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:09.440
 almost suffocated by her own mattress 

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:10.399
 around the same time they began to appear 

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:13.580
 on the wall 

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:15.980
 many messages and prayers that many 

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:18.620
 they say they are from the walled 

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:21.019
 past in the same decade a hunter of 

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:23.660
 ghosts went to the place with 

00:02:21.019 --> 00:02:25.850
 motion and 

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:27.980
 many other weapons 

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:30.970
 to normal operations were 

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:33.430
 with the bells ringing only 

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:36.040
 nor objects moving around the house and 

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:38.500
 even some photos were taken 

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:40.930
 however the strangest story was the 

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:44.260
 of a ghost who told his own 

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:47.380
 life through writings on the wall melry 

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:50.080
 neri as he called himself the ghost 

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:52.690
 said that it was a cold that had 

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:56.070
 left the religious life to marry 

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:59.020
 with a rich man even a man who killed 

00:02:56.070 --> 00:03:01.870
 strangled and buried in the basement in the house 

00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:04.930
 without even a prayer is some 

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:07.780
 of messages found on walls 

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:10.060
 there were two predictions one said that the 

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:12.580
 house would catch fire and another that the 

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:15.040
 mary larry skeleton would be found 

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:17.830
 shortly after that appears 

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:20.470
 the house was burned and while they were digging 

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:24.550
 a place to repair the skeleton of 

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:27.270
 a woman was found in 1944 the house 

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:30.220
 was finally destroyed but its legends and 

00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:32.290
 events are still remembered because 

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:35.200
 certainly something very strange 

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:38.550
 happened there and since its remote past 

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:41.440
 the place seemed to be cursed 

00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:42.519
