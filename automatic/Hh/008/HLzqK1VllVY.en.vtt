played on the next-gen system I

00:00:18.279 --> 00:00:20.759 
played on the next-gen system I
currently<00:00:18.669> have<00:00:18.880> the<00:00:18.939> xbox<00:00:19.210> one<00:00:19.630> hopefully<00:00:20.560> in

00:00:20.759 --> 00:00:20.769 
currently have the xbox one hopefully in

00:00:20.769 --> 00:00:22.499 
currently have the xbox one hopefully in
the<00:00:20.919> in<00:00:21.069> the<00:00:21.099> future<00:00:21.609> near<00:00:21.880> future<00:00:22.089> I<00:00:22.239> can<00:00:22.269> get

00:00:22.499 --> 00:00:22.509 
the in the future near future I can get

00:00:22.509 --> 00:00:26.159 
the in the future near future I can get
the<00:00:22.630> PlayStation<00:00:23.289> as<00:00:23.470> well<00:00:24.220> and<00:00:24.749> then<00:00:25.749> have

00:00:26.159 --> 00:00:26.169 
the PlayStation as well and then have

00:00:26.169 --> 00:00:27.329 
the PlayStation as well and then have
both<00:00:26.319> systems<00:00:26.679> so<00:00:26.769> I<00:00:26.829> could<00:00:26.949> play<00:00:27.130> all<00:00:27.310> of

00:00:27.329 --> 00:00:27.339 
both systems so I could play all of

00:00:27.339 --> 00:00:29.130 
both systems so I could play all of
y'all<00:00:27.669> that's<00:00:28.269> the<00:00:28.479> advantage<00:00:28.689> of<00:00:28.929> all<00:00:29.109> that

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:29.140 
y'all that's the advantage of all that

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:31.710 
y'all that's the advantage of all that
so<00:00:29.529> we'll<00:00:30.159> see<00:00:30.369> how<00:00:30.399> all<00:00:30.729> that<00:00:30.880> work<00:00:31.089> works<00:00:31.479> out

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:31.720 
so we'll see how all that work works out

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:34.110 
so we'll see how all that work works out
i'm<00:00:32.410> definitely<00:00:32.470> a<00:00:32.890> lot<00:00:33.370> smaller<00:00:33.820> of<00:00:34.060> a

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:34.120 
i'm definitely a lot smaller of a

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:35.760 
i'm definitely a lot smaller of a
channel<00:00:34.360> so<00:00:34.600> i<00:00:34.630> don't<00:00:34.810> have<00:00:34.870> as<00:00:35.230> many<00:00:35.350> people

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:35.770 
channel so i don't have as many people
