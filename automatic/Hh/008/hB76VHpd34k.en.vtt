as she said it just was going to be too

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:50.179 
as she said it just was going to be too
much<00:01:47.070> to<00:01:47.220> overcome<00:01:47.280> but<00:01:47.850> they<00:01:48.540> I<00:01:49.130> asked<00:01:50.130> them

every<00:01:50.430> which<00:01:50.579> way<00:01:50.610> about<00:01:51.000> why<00:01:51.479> these<00:01:52.380> runs<00:01:52.680> end

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:53.070 
every which way about why these runs end

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:54.859 
every which way about why these runs end
up<00:01:53.159> being<00:01:53.369> necessary<00:01:53.820> or<00:01:54.000> kind<00:01:54.600> of<00:01:54.630> what<00:01:54.780> they

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:12.270 
opponent I'm hoping I'm hoping this gets
Iowa<00:03:09.549> State<00:03:09.730> to<00:03:09.849> omaha<00:03:10.239> and<00:03:10.530> its<00:03:11.530> really<00:03:11.890> tough

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:12.280 
Iowa State to omaha and its really tough

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:14.339 
Iowa State to omaha and its really tough
to<00:03:12.390> when<00:03:13.390> you<00:03:13.480> look<00:03:13.629> at<00:03:13.750> seating<00:03:14.049> i<00:03:14.140> think

00:03:14.339 --> 00:03:14.349 
to when you look at seating i think

00:03:14.349 --> 00:03:15.690 
to when you look at seating i think
they're<00:03:14.470> still<00:03:14.650> going<00:03:14.890> to<00:03:15.010> be<00:03:15.099> a<00:03:15.129> three<00:03:15.459> seed

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:15.700 
they're still going to be a three seed

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:18.539 
they're still going to be a three seed
but<00:03:16.150> i'm<00:03:16.239> hoping<00:03:16.450> somehow<00:03:17.160> someway<00:03:18.160> there's<00:03:18.489> a

00:03:18.539 --> 00:03:18.549 
but i'm hoping somehow someway there's a

00:03:18.549 --> 00:03:20.190 
but i'm hoping somehow someway there's a
lot<00:03:18.849> of<00:03:18.880> people<00:03:19.239> here<00:03:19.450> in<00:03:19.540> Kansas<00:03:19.870> City<00:03:19.900> that

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:20.200 
lot of people here in Kansas City that

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:22.080 
lot of people here in Kansas City that
feel<00:03:20.349> Iowa<00:03:20.680> State<00:03:20.859> will<00:03:21.010> end<00:03:21.160> up<00:03:21.280> in<00:03:21.400> Omaha<00:03:21.819> so

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:22.090 
feel Iowa State will end up in Omaha so

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:24.240 
feel Iowa State will end up in Omaha so
hopefully<00:03:23.049> that's<00:03:23.230> the<00:03:23.290> case<00:03:23.349> yeah<00:03:23.889> and<00:03:24.160> I

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:24.250 
hopefully that's the case yeah and I

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:25.920 
hopefully that's the case yeah and I
mean<00:03:24.280> this<00:03:24.639> was<00:03:24.790> one<00:03:25.269> of<00:03:25.299> the<00:03:25.450> scenario<00:03:25.870> that

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:25.930 
mean this was one of the scenario that

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:28.020 
mean this was one of the scenario that
Jolin<00:03:26.470> already<00:03:26.709> mentioned<00:03:27.069> as<00:03:27.190> a<00:03:27.220> possible

00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:28.030 
Jolin already mentioned as a possible

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:30.270 
Jolin already mentioned as a possible
route<00:03:28.209> to<00:03:28.419> a<00:03:28.450> two<00:03:28.660> seat<00:03:28.930> as<00:03:29.109> tough<00:03:29.590> as<00:03:29.739> that<00:03:29.769> you

00:03:30.270 --> 00:03:30.280 
route to a two seat as tough as that you

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:32.490 
route to a two seat as tough as that you
know<00:03:30.400> top<00:03:30.609> eight<00:03:30.819> is<00:03:31.000> to<00:03:31.150> crack<00:03:31.419> I<00:03:31.690> think<00:03:32.410> the

00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:32.500 
know top eight is to crack I think the

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:34.259 
know top eight is to crack I think the
value<00:03:32.769> regular<00:03:33.129> season<00:03:33.459> championship<00:03:33.849> sat<00:03:34.090> on

00:03:34.259 --> 00:03:34.269 
value regular season championship sat on

00:03:34.269 --> 00:03:36.930 
value regular season championship sat on
Kansas<00:03:35.109> got<00:03:35.290> that<00:03:35.560> they<00:03:35.919> played<00:03:36.190> you<00:03:36.910> know
