00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:31.990
 we have to pay attention are that 

00:00:29.199 --> 00:00:34.900

00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:36.910
 hip is on top of my knee other 

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:39.160
 another important thing is that the arms 

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:41.710
 do not be too far from me 

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:44.770
 that are the width of my shoulders and 

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:46.220
 my legs will be at the height of my 

00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:48.500
 hips 

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:52.510
 the head has to look slightly 

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:55.239
 between 2 1 and 2 quarters ahead of me 

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:57.010
 in this position I'm going to do the 

00:00:55.239 --> 00:00:59.469

00:00:59.469 --> 00:01:06.780
 old I'll let the tipa fall 

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:06.780
 towards the mat and releasing the air 

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:14.610
 I take the navel to the ceiling 

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:24.940
 you can also do the exercise 

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:27.820

 a horse opposition 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:37.740
 and when I let go of the air I'm going to use 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:41.130
