00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:05.279
 Hello and welcome to one 

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:08.189
 new series from me and this series hot 

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:09.450
 illogical things in minecraft so 

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:13.139
 minecraft is a game like all of us 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:15.360
 know and it's just true to reality 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:16.049
 but you can be so realistic 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:17.820
 do not do that 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:19.619
 and that's why a few blatant 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:22.199
 things that are in real life at all 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:23.730
 could not give so so has hab 

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:26.580
 I have a pretty blatant 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:28.949
 set up so now this is what you hear 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:32.040
 let's say that all these stones are here 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:34.140
 is a whole inventory yes that's okay 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:37.380
 Although a bit illogical if you do that 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:39.120
 walk around with the inventory once 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:42.450
 It can be so but it still gets you excited 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:45.450
 a bit illogical so about one 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:47.100
 square meter rise what about that yes 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:47.809
 who is that about is about one 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:51.239
 meter 

00:00:47.809 --> 00:00:53.070
 as in real life about three tons 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:55.620
 and a rather a square with the 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:01:02.730
 square to a cubic meter earth 1.5 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:01:04.769
 tonnes of cubic count 2304 blocks can 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:11.729
 you have in your whole inventory so 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:15.020
 three tons times 2304 is 6912 tons 

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:18.990
 So a human in minecraft can 

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:21.390
 for example 6 almost 7000 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:22.220
 carry tons with you and then 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:27.150
 still running 

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:29.430
 I think that's pretty blatant and so 

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:33.000
 this is all a human being can do 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:34.409
 make it so rum so carry around a 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.329
 real human could i was such a blog 

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:38.490
 because he already weighs three tons 

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:42.240
 I know I know it sounds a bit 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:43.500
 you mean but that's really true 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:45.899
 if you have such a small brick 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:47.040
 also interviewed a bit so 

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:50.850
 Now we come to the next thing 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:55.740
 this list is just all staples 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:57.630
 that's 3405 and 56 if you can 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:59.070
 take two to three tons are lisa 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:00.719
 crate 10 tons 

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:05.280
 and that can be even easier 

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:07.590
 Carry out wooden boxes 1 and this one 

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:10.769
 all these blocks fit that way 

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:11.580
 a little box so that if I have 

00:02:10.769 --> 00:02:13.200
 right and logical 

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:15.090
 but there are a few more as well right now 

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:17.370
 logical things so as said so the 

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:20.220
 not so illogical thing is not 

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:22.080
 so completely illogical but well you can 

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:23.819
 So they look at these six 

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:26.910
 stone makes you a single stone 

00:02:23.819 --> 00:02:29.870
 then and the clock becomes a small table 

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:34.470
 From these four wooden boards you can 

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:36.330
 make a wooden board my block or 

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:44.310
 here or here it is still a bit 

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:46.709
 otherwise from 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 from nine 

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:49.250
 You can block a single block 

00:02:46.709 --> 00:02:50.880
 make it impossible 

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:54.599
 but maybe not 

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:55.260
 but this is height so that 

00:02:54.599 --> 00:02:58.860
 next thing 

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:59.879
 this is matt stone matt stone you have 

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:02.310
 infinitely 

00:02:59.879 --> 00:03:03.690
 so you can infinitely these lamps 

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:05.010
 let shine can be infinite 

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:09.750
 move these slopes 

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:12.900
 that would be normal impossible because one 

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:14.700
 needs energy so need someone 

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:17.819
 energy is on the light energy or 

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:20.930
 if that is any heat energy around 

00:03:17.819 --> 00:03:23.970
 or kinetic energy to do that 

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:27.090
 maybe maybe you understand that 

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:28.650
 not now but you can get in 

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:29.660
 real life not infinite energy 

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:32.790
 to have 

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:35.670
 So it's a bit in physics 

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:37.230
 pure but yes that's the third 

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:39.900
 most impossible thing so that now 

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:41.400
 three causes in minecraft maybe 

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:45.209
 you liked that 

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:46.950
 I thought that was pretty cool, yes I can 

00:03:45.209 --> 00:03:49.829
 Definitely a few more besides 

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:51.780
 these three now here so i could 

00:03:49.829 --> 00:03:53.160
 Follow it from a few more 

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:55.380
 bring her if you like her 

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:57.870
 So did many thanks for I look 

00:03:55.380 --> 00:03:59.180
 Maybe I'll do my turn 

00:03:57.870 --> 00:04:02.180
 and show and a few more 

00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:02.180
 People
