unless<00:02:03.390> fully<00:02:04.390> adjustable<00:02:05.789> obviously<00:02:06.789> power

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:07.060 
unless fully adjustable obviously power

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:16.070 
unless fully adjustable obviously power
on<00:02:07.960> and<00:02:08.289> off<00:02:12.450> the<00:02:13.450> system<00:02:13.840> itself<00:02:14.230> is<00:02:14.910> it's

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:16.080 
on and off the system itself is it's

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:20.300 
on and off the system itself is it's
basically<00:02:17.080> is<00:02:17.709> sixty<00:02:18.400> watts

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:20.310 
basically is sixty watts

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:23.460 
basically is sixty watts
like<00:02:21.310> that's<00:02:21.550> basically<00:02:21.970> what<00:02:22.569> what<00:02:23.290> the

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:23.470 
like that's basically what what the

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:28.410 
like that's basically what what the
manufacturer<00:02:24.099> says<00:02:24.400> it<00:02:24.640> is<00:02:24.790> and<00:02:25.380> it<00:02:26.380> Peaks<00:02:27.420> 120
