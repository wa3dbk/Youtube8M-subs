a full walkthrough of everything here so

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:48.440 
a full walkthrough of everything here so
this<00:00:46.469> is<00:00:46.620> what<00:00:46.770> the<00:00:46.920> reader<00:00:47.100> looks<00:00:47.700> like<00:00:47.969> by

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:48.450 
this is what the reader looks like by

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:52.729 
this is what the reader looks like by
default<00:00:48.510> it<00:00:49.170> has<00:00:49.469> a<00:00:49.739> leather<00:00:50.370> outside<00:00:51.739> suede

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:52.739 
default it has a leather outside suede

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:55.400 
default it has a leather outside suede
insert<00:00:53.190> for<00:00:53.460> the<00:00:53.489> case<00:00:54.079> here's<00:00:55.079> the<00:00:55.230> reader

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:55.410 
insert for the case here's the reader

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:58.580 
insert for the case here's the reader
itself<00:00:55.770> and<00:00:56.100> it<00:00:56.789> is<00:00:56.969> flush<00:00:57.660> with<00:00:57.930> the<00:00:58.379> back

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:58.590 
itself and it is flush with the back

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:01.849 
itself and it is flush with the back
like<00:00:59.489> so<00:00:59.730> because<00:00:59.969> this<00:01:00.300> is<00:01:00.480> a<00:01:00.510> built<00:01:00.809> in<00:01:00.989> case

00:01:01.849 --> 00:01:01.859 
like so because this is a built in case

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:05.570 
like so because this is a built in case
and<00:01:02.160> the<00:01:02.699> backing<00:01:02.940> is<00:01:03.510> all<00:01:03.840> one<00:01:04.199> piece<00:01:04.580> we're

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
and the backing is all one piece we're

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:07.550 
and the backing is all one piece we're
gonna<00:01:05.640> take<00:01:05.939> this<00:01:06.060> off<00:01:06.299> we've<00:01:07.140> left<00:01:07.350> it<00:01:07.500> a

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 
gonna take this off we've left it a

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:09.200 
gonna take this off we've left it a
little<00:01:07.710> bit<00:01:07.830> off<00:01:07.950> here<00:01:08.189> so<00:01:08.220> to<00:01:08.520> cut<00:01:08.880> down<00:01:09.000> on

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
little bit off here so to cut down on

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:13.580 
little bit off here so to cut down on
time<00:01:11.030> it<00:01:12.030> connects<00:01:12.390> with<00:01:12.540> many<00:01:13.110> different

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
time it connects with many different

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:15.230 
time it connects with many different
little<00:01:13.799> tabs<00:01:14.159> here<00:01:14.460> so<00:01:14.670> make<00:01:14.850> sure<00:01:15.000> you're

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
little tabs here so make sure you're

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:17.109 
little tabs here so make sure you're
very<00:01:15.270> careful<00:01:15.509> not<00:01:16.080> to<00:01:16.140> break<00:01:16.439> any<00:01:16.650> of<00:01:16.740> them

00:01:17.109 --> 00:01:17.119 
very careful not to break any of them

00:01:17.119 --> 00:01:19.550 
very careful not to break any of them
replacement<00:01:18.119> cases<00:01:18.420> can<00:01:18.600> be<00:01:18.780> expensive<00:01:19.170> you

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
replacement cases can be expensive you

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:21.859 
replacement cases can be expensive you
see<00:01:20.280> that<00:01:20.460> the<00:01:20.549> back<00:01:20.729> is<00:01:20.759> built<00:01:21.210> into<00:01:21.420> the<00:01:21.689> case

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:21.869 
see that the back is built into the case

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:25.270 
see that the back is built into the case
itself<00:01:22.259> here<00:01:22.920> is<00:01:23.130> the<00:01:23.310> reader<00:01:23.549> exposed<00:01:24.180> and

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:25.280 
itself here is the reader exposed and

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:27.440 
itself here is the reader exposed and
this<00:01:26.280> is<00:01:26.460> what<00:01:26.580> Michael<00:01:26.759> was<00:01:27.000> referring<00:01:27.330> to

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
this is what Michael was referring to

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:30.830 
this is what Michael was referring to
because<00:01:27.780> it's<00:01:28.770> all<00:01:29.040> kind<00:01:29.460> of<00:01:29.670> there's<00:01:30.600> like

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 
because it's all kind of there's like

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:32.929 
because it's all kind of there's like
terminals<00:01:31.350> exposed<00:01:31.799> and<00:01:32.130> holes<00:01:32.400> down<00:01:32.670> to<00:01:32.850> the

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:32.939 
terminals exposed and holes down to the

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:34.999 
terminals exposed and holes down to the
circuit<00:01:33.299> board<00:01:33.380> kind<00:01:34.380> of<00:01:34.439> a<00:01:34.530> weird<00:01:34.740> design

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
circuit board kind of a weird design

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:36.649 
circuit board kind of a weird design
you're<00:01:35.340> you're<00:01:35.579> meant<00:01:35.820> to<00:01:35.909> also<00:01:36.329> take<00:01:36.540> the

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:36.659 
you're you're meant to also take the

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:39.260 
you're you're meant to also take the
back<00:01:36.810> up<00:01:37.049> because<00:01:37.350> it<00:01:37.500> gains<00:01:37.799> access<00:01:38.130> to<00:01:38.400> the

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270 
back up because it gains access to the

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:42.350 
back up because it gains access to the
micro<00:01:39.689> SD<00:01:40.200> card<00:01:40.470> slot<00:01:40.759> very<00:01:41.759> weird<00:01:42.030> design

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360 
micro SD card slot very weird design

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:45.649 
micro SD card slot very weird design
yeah<00:01:42.869> but<00:01:43.110> I<00:01:43.140> mean<00:01:43.320> from<00:01:43.979> experience<00:01:44.759> on<00:01:45.000> using

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:45.659 
yeah but I mean from experience on using

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:48.200 
yeah but I mean from experience on using
this<00:01:45.780> during<00:01:46.079> the<00:01:46.290> past<00:01:46.530> week<00:01:46.890> it<00:01:47.759> gets<00:01:47.970> really

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:48.210 
this during the past week it gets really

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:50.990 
this during the past week it gets really
uncomfortable<00:01:48.990> if<00:01:49.170> you<00:01:49.320> want<00:01:49.560> to<00:01:49.799> use<00:01:50.759> the

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.000 
uncomfortable if you want to use the

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:52.819 
uncomfortable if you want to use the
reader<00:01:51.240> without<00:01:51.720> the<00:01:51.899> case<00:01:52.140> because<00:01:52.619> you<00:01:52.740> have

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:52.829 
reader without the case because you have

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:54.800 
reader without the case because you have
these<00:01:52.950> little<00:01:53.220> things<00:01:53.340> like<00:01:53.759> jabbing<00:01:54.420> at<00:01:54.600> you

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810 
these little things like jabbing at you

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:57.590 
these little things like jabbing at you
all<00:01:55.229> the<00:01:55.380> time<00:01:55.619> and<00:01:55.860> for<00:01:55.950> me<00:01:56.610> I'm<00:01:56.759> not<00:01:57.119> a<00:01:57.329> huge

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:57.600 
all the time and for me I'm not a huge

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:00.050 
all the time and for me I'm not a huge
fan<00:01:57.840> of<00:01:57.869> cases<00:01:58.380> myself<00:01:58.890> I<00:01:59.130> kind<00:01:59.549> of<00:01:59.579> like<00:01:59.850> the

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:00.060 
fan of cases myself I kind of like the

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:02.690 
fan of cases myself I kind of like the
e-readers<00:02:00.570> and<00:02:00.960> I<00:02:01.409> like<00:02:01.649> the<00:02:01.799> slim<00:02:02.130> profiles

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:02.700 
e-readers and I like the slim profiles

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:04.130 
e-readers and I like the slim profiles
like<00:02:02.969> being<00:02:03.180> able<00:02:03.270> to<00:02:03.390> just<00:02:03.570> put<00:02:03.719> in<00:02:03.869> my<00:02:03.960> back

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:04.140 
like being able to just put in my back

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:06.649 
like being able to just put in my back
pocket<00:02:04.680> right<00:02:04.920> this<00:02:05.280> I<00:02:05.490> kind<00:02:05.850> of<00:02:05.939> felt<00:02:06.210> like<00:02:06.270> it

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:06.659 
pocket right this I kind of felt like it

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:10.339 
pocket right this I kind of felt like it
added<00:02:07.409> a<00:02:07.439> little<00:02:08.069> bit<00:02:08.310> more<00:02:08.640> like<00:02:09.179> girth<00:02:09.569> so<00:02:10.140> it

00:02:10.339 --> 00:02:10.349 
added a little bit more like girth so it

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:13.460 
added a little bit more like girth so it
was<00:02:10.470> harder<00:02:10.860> to<00:02:10.890> fit<00:02:11.190> in<00:02:11.340> my<00:02:11.459> back<00:02:11.670> pocket<00:02:12.270> and

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:13.470 
was harder to fit in my back pocket and

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:14.870 
was harder to fit in my back pocket and
a little<00:02:13.710> bit<00:02:13.800> inconvenient<00:02:14.250> too<00:02:14.550> because<00:02:14.760> if

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:14.880 
a little bit inconvenient too because if

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:17.420 
a little bit inconvenient too because if
you<00:02:14.970> want<00:02:15.150> to<00:02:15.240> use<00:02:15.390> it<00:02:15.540> with<00:02:15.720> the<00:02:15.750> case<00:02:16.430> you

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:17.430 
you want to use it with the case you

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:19.490 
you want to use it with the case you
have<00:02:17.610> this<00:02:17.850> case<00:02:18.690> that's<00:02:18.990> always<00:02:19.200> kind<00:02:19.440> of

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:19.500 
have this case that's always kind of

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:21.380 
have this case that's always kind of
moving<00:02:19.830> around<00:02:19.920> because<00:02:20.490> it's<00:02:20.670> very<00:02:21.000> thin

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:21.390 
moving around because it's very thin

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:23.810 
moving around because it's very thin
connector<00:02:22.170> here<00:02:22.410> and<00:02:22.590> you<00:02:23.340> always<00:02:23.460> have<00:02:23.670> to

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:23.820 
connector here and you always have to

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:25.760 
connector here and you always have to
kind<00:02:23.970> of<00:02:24.150> hide<00:02:24.570> it<00:02:24.780> or<00:02:24.870> tuck<00:02:25.080> it<00:02:25.200> away<00:02:25.290> and<00:02:25.650> you

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:25.770 
kind of hide it or tuck it away and you

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:28.040 
kind of hide it or tuck it away and you
end<00:02:25.890> up<00:02:26.010> it's<00:02:27.000> just<00:02:27.240> it's<00:02:27.450> not<00:02:27.600> very<00:02:27.810> pleasant

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:28.050 
end up it's just it's not very pleasant

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:29.960 
end up it's just it's not very pleasant
to<00:02:28.260> hold<00:02:28.470> so<00:02:28.830> yeah<00:02:29.010> when<00:02:29.400> you<00:02:29.490> take<00:02:29.670> the<00:02:29.790> case

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:29.970 
to hold so yeah when you take the case

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:31.700 
to hold so yeah when you take the case
off<00:02:30.150> Oh<00:02:30.450> a<00:02:30.480> little<00:02:30.780> problem<00:02:31.080> solve<00:02:31.290> well<00:02:31.530> not

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:31.710 
off Oh a little problem solve well not

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:33.170 
off Oh a little problem solve well not
really<00:02:31.920> cuz<00:02:32.190> now<00:02:32.340> everything's<00:02:32.760> exposed

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:33.180 
really cuz now everything's exposed

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:35.630 
really cuz now everything's exposed
these<00:02:33.720> two<00:02:33.930> terminals<00:02:34.200> here<00:02:34.650> are<00:02:35.130> positive

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:35.640 
these two terminals here are positive

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:38.840 
these two terminals here are positive
and<00:02:35.760> negative<00:02:35.820> to<00:02:36.240> power<00:02:36.510> the<00:02:36.900> case<00:02:37.550> like<00:02:38.550> so

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:38.850 
and negative to power the case like so

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:40.610 
and negative to power the case like so
where<00:02:39.450> these<00:02:39.570> little<00:02:39.810> pins<00:02:40.020> are<00:02:40.230> so<00:02:40.440> make<00:02:40.590> sure

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:40.620 
where these little pins are so make sure

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:42.170 
where these little pins are so make sure
nothing<00:02:41.250> kind<00:02:41.490> of<00:02:41.610> gets<00:02:41.760> in<00:02:41.850> the<00:02:41.880> way<00:02:42.000> of<00:02:42.030> that

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:42.180 
nothing kind of gets in the way of that

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:44.360 
nothing kind of gets in the way of that
installation<00:02:43.140> is<00:02:43.230> very<00:02:43.260> simple<00:02:43.470> of<00:02:43.920> this<00:02:44.100> case

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:44.370 
installation is very simple of this case

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:49.460 
installation is very simple of this case
you<00:02:45.300> just<00:02:45.540> snap<00:02:45.750> it<00:02:45.930> on<00:02:46.130> like<00:02:47.130> so<00:02:48.410> yeah<00:02:49.410> you

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:49.470 
you just snap it on like so yeah you

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:51.610 
you just snap it on like so yeah you
just<00:02:49.709> press<00:02:49.920> firmly<00:02:50.250> down<00:02:50.430> there's<00:02:50.940> really<00:02:51.120> no

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:51.620 
just press firmly down there's really no

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:53.660 
just press firmly down there's really no
technical<00:02:52.620> science<00:02:53.100> and<00:02:53.280> nobody<00:02:53.520> could

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:53.670 
technical science and nobody could

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:55.580 
technical science and nobody could
pretty<00:02:53.880> well<00:02:53.940> do<00:02:54.209> this<00:02:54.390> once<00:02:55.050> again<00:02:55.200> make<00:02:55.560> sure

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:55.590 
pretty well do this once again make sure

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:58.370 
pretty well do this once again make sure
it's<00:02:55.830> in<00:02:56.400> line<00:02:57.300> because<00:02:57.540> if<00:02:57.810> you<00:02:57.930> push<00:02:58.140> down

00:02:58.370 --> 00:02:58.380 
it's in line because if you push down

00:02:58.380 --> 00:02:59.810 
it's in line because if you push down
when<00:02:58.650> you're<00:02:58.770> not<00:02:58.920> when<00:02:59.130> it's<00:02:59.280> not<00:02:59.459> lined<00:02:59.670> up

00:02:59.810 --> 00:02:59.820 
when you're not when it's not lined up

00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:02.150 
when you're not when it's not lined up
you<00:03:00.000> might<00:03:00.180> snap<00:03:00.480> the<00:03:00.660> tabs<00:03:00.900> now<00:03:01.680> your<00:03:01.890> device

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:02.160 
you might snap the tabs now your device

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:05.330 
you might snap the tabs now your device
is<00:03:02.340> heavier<00:03:02.700> significantly<00:03:03.630> and<00:03:03.930> thicker<00:03:04.709> you

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:05.340 
is heavier significantly and thicker you

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:07.730 
is heavier significantly and thicker you
can<00:03:05.370> see<00:03:05.700> here<00:03:06.030> it's<00:03:06.420> bulged<00:03:06.840> open<00:03:07.200> because<00:03:07.380> of

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:07.740 
can see here it's bulged open because of

00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:10.220 
can see here it's bulged open because of
the<00:03:07.920> integrated<00:03:08.730> light<00:03:09.000> the<00:03:09.600> outside<00:03:09.990> of<00:03:10.140> the

how<00:03:27.420> you<00:03:27.480> reveal<00:03:28.230> this<00:03:28.410> is<00:03:28.680> you<00:03:28.980> slide<00:03:29.700> it<00:03:29.880> out

00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:30.000 
how you reveal this is you slide it out

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.570 
how you reveal this is you slide it out
this<00:03:30.810> is<00:03:30.840> a<00:03:31.019> flex<00:03:31.410> cable<00:03:31.860> so<00:03:32.070> you<00:03:32.100> don't<00:03:32.400> want

00:03:32.570 --> 00:03:32.580 
this is a flex cable so you don't want

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:34.670 
this is a flex cable so you don't want
to<00:03:32.670> bend<00:03:32.880> that<00:03:33.120> because<00:03:33.540> it's<00:03:33.810> meant<00:03:34.170> to<00:03:34.260> flex

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:34.680 
to bend that because it's meant to flex

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:38.870 
to bend that because it's meant to flex
to<00:03:34.950> the<00:03:34.980> optimal<00:03:36.739> distance<00:03:37.739> to<00:03:38.459> shoot<00:03:38.730> the

to the optimal distance to shoot the
light<00:03:39.060> down<00:03:39.269> it's<00:03:39.570> the<00:03:39.930> lights<00:03:40.320> are<00:03:40.500> pointed

00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:40.830 
light down it's the lights are pointed

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:42.770 
light down it's the lights are pointed
at<00:03:40.950> an<00:03:41.100> angle<00:03:41.430> there's<00:03:41.850> two<00:03:42.030> LEDs<00:03:42.450> in<00:03:42.600> there

00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:42.780 
at an angle there's two LEDs in there

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:45.020 
at an angle there's two LEDs in there
and<00:03:42.959> when<00:03:43.410> you<00:03:43.530> unsleep<00:03:44.070> the<00:03:44.250> device<00:03:44.519> like<00:03:44.730> so

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:45.030 
and when you unsleep the device like so

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:47.420 
and when you unsleep the device like so
the<00:03:45.630> light<00:03:45.810> starts<00:03:46.170> shining<00:03:46.380> now<00:03:47.160> we've

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:47.430 
the light starts shining now we've

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:48.890 
the light starts shining now we've
tested<00:03:47.640> this<00:03:47.910> in<00:03:48.090> a<00:03:48.150> darkroom<00:03:48.450> and<00:03:48.720> we're

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:48.900 
tested this in a darkroom and we're

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:51.710 
tested this in a darkroom and we're
going<00:03:49.080> to<00:03:49.110> do<00:03:49.320> that<00:03:49.940> right<00:03:50.940> after<00:03:51.120> we<00:03:51.330> optimize

00:03:51.710 --> 00:03:51.720 
going to do that right after we optimize

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:54.080 
going to do that right after we optimize
the<00:03:51.750> camera<00:03:52.200> for<00:03:52.380> this<00:03:52.470> because<00:03:52.890> the<00:03:53.190> light<00:03:53.850> is

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:54.090 
the camera for this because the light is

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:57.620 
the camera for this because the light is
actually<00:03:54.810> pretty<00:03:55.290> dim<00:03:55.680> and<00:03:56.010> it's<00:03:56.310> it<00:03:57.120> doesn't

00:03:57.620 --> 00:03:57.630 
actually pretty dim and it's it doesn't

00:03:57.630 --> 00:03:59.270 
actually pretty dim and it's it doesn't
really<00:03:57.720> cover<00:03:57.989> the<00:03:58.080> whole<00:03:58.290> screen<00:03:58.650> so<00:03:58.950> we're

00:03:59.270 --> 00:03:59.280 
really cover the whole screen so we're

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:01.520 
really cover the whole screen so we're
gonna<00:03:59.370> do<00:03:59.549> a<00:03:59.580> nighttime<00:03:59.850> test<00:04:00.330> right<00:04:00.660> now<00:04:00.810> so

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:01.530 
gonna do a nighttime test right now so

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:03.140 
gonna do a nighttime test right now so
we<00:04:01.709> have<00:04:01.860> the<00:04:01.980> light<00:04:02.160> on<00:04:02.190> there<00:04:02.850> aren't<00:04:03.030> really

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:03.150 
we have the light on there aren't really

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:05.240 
we have the light on there aren't really
any<00:04:03.269> controls<00:04:03.930> for<00:04:04.230> the<00:04:04.380> intensity<00:04:04.980> of<00:04:05.130> the

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:05.250 
any controls for the intensity of the

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:10.060 
any controls for the intensity of the
light<00:04:05.430> if<00:04:06.290> you<00:04:07.290> put<00:04:07.709> it<00:04:07.830> away<00:04:08.420> you<00:04:09.420> see<00:04:09.630> that

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:10.070 
light if you put it away you see that

00:04:10.070 --> 00:04:12.650 
light if you put it away you see that
you<00:04:11.070> can't<00:04:11.280> really<00:04:11.430> see<00:04:11.670> anything<00:04:12.060> we<00:04:12.510> have<00:04:12.630> a

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:12.660 
you can't really see anything we have a

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:14.930 
you can't really see anything we have a
little<00:04:12.870> bit<00:04:12.989> of<00:04:13.080> ambient<00:04:13.470> light<00:04:13.530> and<00:04:13.940> the

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:14.940 
little bit of ambient light and the

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:17.060 
little bit of ambient light and the
reason<00:04:15.269> why<00:04:15.420> is<00:04:15.480> cuz<00:04:16.080> when<00:04:16.709> you<00:04:16.799> turn<00:04:16.950> the

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:17.070 
reason why is cuz when you turn the

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:17.449 
reason why is cuz when you turn the
light<00:04:17.250> on

00:04:17.449 --> 00:04:17.459 
light on

00:04:17.459 --> 00:04:20.659 
light on
you<00:04:18.150> still<00:04:18.419> can't<00:04:18.690> really<00:04:18.840> see<00:04:19.109> anything<00:04:20.400> you

00:04:20.659 --> 00:04:20.669 
you still can't really see anything you

00:04:20.669 --> 00:04:23.659 
you still can't really see anything you
get<00:04:20.850> super<00:04:21.570> harsh<00:04:21.750> intensity<00:04:22.320> up<00:04:22.440> here<00:04:22.680> but<00:04:23.550> as

00:04:23.659 --> 00:04:23.669 
get super harsh intensity up here but as

00:04:23.669 --> 00:04:25.330 
get super harsh intensity up here but as
you<00:04:23.789> come<00:04:24.000> all<00:04:24.210> the<00:04:24.300> way<00:04:24.330> down<00:04:24.390> here

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:25.340 
you come all the way down here

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:28.510 
you come all the way down here
it's<00:04:25.700> really<00:04:26.300> not<00:04:26.960> that<00:04:27.410> great<00:04:27.800> it's<00:04:28.130> a<00:04:28.280> little

00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:28.520 
it's really not that great it's a little

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:30.610 
it's really not that great it's a little
bit<00:04:28.639> more<00:04:28.790> readable<00:04:29.030> by<00:04:29.750> the<00:04:29.810> naked<00:04:30.050> eye<00:04:30.320> but

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:30.620 
bit more readable by the naked eye but

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:33.370 
bit more readable by the naked eye but
honestly<00:04:31.130> it's<00:04:31.880> not<00:04:32.270> it's<00:04:32.810> not<00:04:33.020> it's<00:04:33.260> not

00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:33.380 
honestly it's not it's not it's not

00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:35.140 
honestly it's not it's not it's not
doing<00:04:33.590> a<00:04:33.680> good<00:04:33.770> enough<00:04:33.860> job<00:04:34.010> yeah<00:04:34.639> and<00:04:34.880> this

00:04:35.140 --> 00:04:35.150 
doing a good enough job yeah and this

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:37.960 
doing a good enough job yeah and this
you<00:04:35.630> it's<00:04:35.990> not<00:04:36.260> malleable<00:04:37.010> no<00:04:37.250> so<00:04:37.490> you<00:04:37.550> can't

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:37.970 
you it's not malleable no so you can't

00:04:37.970 --> 00:04:40.540 
you it's not malleable no so you can't
like<00:04:38.240> okay<00:04:38.900> I<00:04:38.930> find<00:04:39.470> that<00:04:39.740> like<00:04:39.980> this<00:04:40.220> is<00:04:40.400> the

00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:40.550 
like okay I find that like this is the

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:43.120 
like okay I find that like this is the
most<00:04:40.730> ideal<00:04:40.940> but<00:04:41.660> it<00:04:42.110> just<00:04:42.290> flips<00:04:42.620> back<00:04:42.889> good

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:43.130 
most ideal but it just flips back good

00:04:43.130 --> 00:04:44.530 
most ideal but it just flips back good
idea<00:04:43.400> I<00:04:43.460> would<00:04:43.580> have<00:04:43.700> liked<00:04:43.850> to<00:04:43.880> see<00:04:44.150> some<00:04:44.389> sort

00:04:44.530 --> 00:04:44.540 
idea I would have liked to see some sort

00:04:44.540 --> 00:04:46.810 
idea I would have liked to see some sort
of<00:04:44.660> flexible<00:04:45.260> wire<00:04:45.530> build<00:04:46.100> inside<00:04:46.610> this

00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:46.820 
of flexible wire build inside this

00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:49.600 
of flexible wire build inside this
rather<00:04:47.090> than<00:04:47.360> yes<00:04:47.810> or<00:04:48.650> it<00:04:48.800> come<00:04:49.070> out<00:04:49.250> even<00:04:49.580> more

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:49.610 
rather than yes or it come out even more

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:52.480 
rather than yes or it come out even more
so<00:04:50.270> you<00:04:50.389> can<00:04:50.540> have<00:04:50.690> it<00:04:50.720> like<00:04:50.990> up<00:04:51.230> and<00:04:51.620> like<00:04:52.190> face

00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:52.490 
so you can have it like up and like face

00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:55.300 
so you can have it like up and like face
down<00:04:52.850> yeah<00:04:53.510> this<00:04:53.810> is<00:04:54.020> sort<00:04:54.260> of<00:04:54.410> like<00:04:54.590> the<00:04:55.010> top

00:04:55.300 --> 00:04:55.310 
down yeah this is sort of like the top

00:04:55.310 --> 00:04:57.430 
down yeah this is sort of like the top
half<00:04:55.610> is<00:04:55.790> illuminated<00:04:56.480> but<00:04:56.630> I<00:04:56.690> mean<00:04:56.870> the<00:04:57.200> video

00:04:57.430 --> 00:04:57.440 
half is illuminated but I mean the video

00:04:57.440 --> 00:04:58.960 
half is illuminated but I mean the video
speaks<00:04:57.830> for<00:04:57.919> itself

00:04:58.960 --> 00:04:58.970 
speaks for itself

00:04:58.970 --> 00:05:01.060 
speaks for itself
I<00:04:59.000> bought<00:04:59.330> up<00:04:59.450> to<00:04:59.570> here<00:04:59.900> is<00:05:00.080> good<00:05:00.380> anything

00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:01.070 
I bought up to here is good anything

00:05:01.070 --> 00:05:02.860 
I bought up to here is good anything
kind<00:05:01.280> of<00:05:01.370> down<00:05:01.640> here<00:05:01.970> starts<00:05:02.419> getting<00:05:02.750> a

00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:02.870 
kind of down here starts getting a

00:05:02.870 --> 00:05:04.780 
kind of down here starts getting a
little<00:05:03.080> bit<00:05:03.350> darker<00:05:03.890> that's<00:05:04.190> not<00:05:04.460> very<00:05:04.640> good

00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:04.790 
little bit darker that's not very good

00:05:04.790 --> 00:05:06.370 
little bit darker that's not very good
now<00:05:05.210> let's<00:05:05.450> see<00:05:05.630> what<00:05:05.840> happens<00:05:06.200> when<00:05:06.320> we

00:05:06.370 --> 00:05:06.380 
now let's see what happens when we

00:05:06.380 --> 00:05:10.390
