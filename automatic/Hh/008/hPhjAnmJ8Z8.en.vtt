00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.780
 there are conditions to build the ct 

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:05.640
 happen if you do not have to 

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:08.250
 plan to teach this for example 

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:09.870
 Do you want to go to the concerts that make a show? 

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:13.320
 In Europe, do you want to take a trip? 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:15.690
 a car ahead is near 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:17.220
 to steal up the path to the contact 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:19.380
 with a lot of people, imagine saving is not 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:20.789
 sacrifice all present to accomplish 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:21.449
 in a single objective in two or three 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:23.609
 years 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:26.519
 You have to use the cuca to have 

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:28.470
 creativity to make very 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:29.250
 smarter simpler 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:31.199
 consumption 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:32.790
 you can a show looking for ways and 

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:35.040
 I could have the free ticket you can 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:37.469
 celebrate grandson and grandson valentines day 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:39.960
 creating something is done by you 

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:42.210
 knew or created a situation a 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:44.160
 romantic moment to free to ask the 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:47.160
 save a photo or things that 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:49.710
 replace money is not to do 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:51.239
 of you the mukirana but rather to leave 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:53.309
 very clear, you're playing the project. 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:55.860
 to realize a dream that is important 

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:58.949
 It's giving a lot of people this will serve 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:01:00.390
 sacrifice yes make sacrifice all 

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:02.129
 sacrifice worth running has a 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:05.010
 great dream to be achieved 

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:06.390
 now if you just make your 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:08.960
 life a life of sacrifices 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:11.880
 we impoverish your routine by sacrificing 

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:14.150
 I was about to lose my social life 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:15.920
 and jeopardize their youth 

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:17.750
 is thinking that you are a partner to have a 

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:20.180
 car to make a single trip is 

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:22.370
 making the celebration a rare moment 

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:24.200
 in your truth 

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:27.140
 be creative to have a better life 

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:29.450
 happy act simple take home food 

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:31.070
 take a ride before the bus picks up a 

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:31.760
 little more time to go where you 

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:34.820
 would you like 

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:37.160
 is with the argument with the excuse that 600 

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:39.170
 - Nice you're building a dream. 

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:40.610
 which will become reality in six 

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:42.860
 months one year two years 

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:44.990
 It does not matter if you do. 

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:47.060
 probably more complicated dreams 

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:49.190
 with nani having a family and having a house 

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:51.710
 to make a great trip in the future 

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:53.720
 It will become easier for me to try 

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:56.660
 convince people trying to convince 

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:59.210
 that saving or saving can be a 

00:01:56.660 --> 00:02:01.490
 kind of not suffering suffering 

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:03.140
 we have to create ways to consume 

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:05.330
 smart way smart way 

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:07.300
 while we are pursuing the goal 

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:09.619
 for the moment you know what you want 

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:11.209
 Scored planning can be a 

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:14.060
 paper sheet imagine you will 

00:02:11.209 --> 00:02:16.010
 dive into this planning study 

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:17.930
 your trip your car 

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:18.950
 To party, you want to participate with 

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:21.019
 the friends 

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:23.209
 The more you get involved with this 

00:02:21.019 --> 00:02:25.640
 project but you search uses internet 

00:02:23.209 --> 00:02:28.100
 talk with friends on the radio is 

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:29.930
 the more you will know this goal and 

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:31.370
 probably cheaper it goes 

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:33.560
 happen it will become more 

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:34.670
 positive because we stayed in a 

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:36.380
 travel from abroad 

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:38.150
 researching this subject I discovered 

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:40.280
 that costs half the price but 

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:43.100
 even less depending on the time that you 

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:44.870
 fly you in advance for this passage 

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:45.620
 only figure out ways to stay in 

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:47.540
 outdoor 

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:49.070
 dividing housing this Sunday into a 

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:50.720
 mattress on the floor for is so much more 

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:53.240
 cheap and prime days 

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:56.260
 or out there is to do a magnificent walk 

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:58.900
 is planning not only realized a 

00:02:56.260 --> 00:03:01.580
 album that was drawn in the future of 

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:03.500
 trust that this principle drawing 

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:06.410
 You actually did a small number. 

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:08.000
 dive into studying the subject so that you 

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:09.500
 find smarter ways than 

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:11.720
 reach this goal 

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:14.540
 This is how in my youth in my 

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:16.460
 adolescence me and java with friends and 

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:19.490
 gift to girlfriend I bought my 

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:20.900
 first car and there was're now on the 

00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:22.940
 I decided to buy his own house to 

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:25.040
 have children and that set up a 

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:27.350
 I will always follow the same reasoning is the 

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:29.780
 life is not to make savings I live the 

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:32.000
 more creative gift i make 

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:33.709
 sacrifices to try to celebrate the 

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:35.570
 result and sacrifice in Brazil does not 

00:03:33.709 --> 00:03:37.070
 too long my life is a celebration 

00:03:35.570 --> 00:03:39.650
 behind the other 

00:03:37.070 --> 00:03:43.610
 This is very motivating. It feeds us. 

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:46.160
 the most alert people available 

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:48.110
 health while infecting 

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:50.060
 in the work routine this has done 

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:52.490
 grow in my career and I hope 

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:54.920
 you young to make many choices 

00:03:52.490 --> 00:03:56.480
 in the next few years it is also 

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:58.760
 perception of small daily expenses 

00:03:56.480 --> 00:04:00.110
 they are important for you to be well 

00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:02.420
 a person less worried the person 

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:05.000
 more motivated and happier to take 

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:06.709
 this contagious energy the work 

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:08.209
 course will do that will be the main 

00:04:06.709 --> 00:04:09.769
 fuel for you is a person 

00:04:08.209 --> 00:04:12.290
 recognized and grow in the career 

00:04:09.769 --> 00:04:13.920
 winning in the chair means having more 

00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:15.690
 money and more money 

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:19.760
 make more choices and perform more 

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:19.760
 dreams this is to have a clean life
