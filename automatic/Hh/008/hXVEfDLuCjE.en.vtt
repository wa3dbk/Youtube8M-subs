beads<00:02:42.670> not<00:02:42.970> leaking<00:02:43.590> so<00:02:44.590> what<00:02:44.680> I'm<00:02:44.770> thinking

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:45.100 
beads not leaking so what I'm thinking

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:47.550 
beads not leaking so what I'm thinking
happened<00:02:45.490> was<00:02:45.670> this<00:02:46.450> little<00:02:46.600> valve<00:02:46.900> stem<00:02:47.260> I

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:47.560 
happened was this little valve stem I

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:49.970 
happened was this little valve stem I
hate<00:02:48.100> these<00:02:48.280> kind<00:02:48.580> of<00:02:48.910> valve<00:02:49.660> stem<00:02:49.840> caps

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:49.980 
hate these kind of valve stem caps

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:53.400 
hate these kind of valve stem caps
because<00:02:51.300> they're<00:02:52.300> the<00:02:52.330> ones<00:02:52.600> where<00:02:52.780> you<00:02:52.810> in

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:53.410 
because they're the ones where you in

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:56.460 
because they're the ones where you in
theory<00:02:53.970> can<00:02:54.970> add<00:02:55.180> air<00:02:55.390> to<00:02:55.420> them<00:02:55.750> without

00:02:56.460 --> 00:02:56.470 
theory can add air to them without

00:02:56.470 --> 00:02:59.160 
theory can add air to them without
having<00:02:56.920> a<00:02:57.220> longer<00:02:57.520> valve<00:02:57.700> stem<00:02:58.000> you<00:02:58.390> got<00:02:58.540> you

00:02:59.160 --> 00:02:59.170 
having a longer valve stem you got you

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:02.310 
having a longer valve stem you got you
know<00:02:59.200> big<00:02:59.560> hubcaps<00:03:00.480> but<00:03:01.480> in<00:03:01.660> my<00:03:01.690> opinion<00:03:01.960> these

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:02.320 
know big hubcaps but in my opinion these

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:04.110 
know big hubcaps but in my opinion these
are<00:03:02.500> garbage<00:03:02.950> you<00:03:03.430> know<00:03:03.580> they'll<00:03:03.760> stick

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:04.120 
are garbage you know they'll stick

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:07.350 
are garbage you know they'll stick
sometimes<00:03:04.600> they<00:03:04.780> get<00:03:04.900> cruddud<00:03:05.590> and<00:03:06.360> their

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:07.360 
sometimes they get cruddud and their

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:12.720
