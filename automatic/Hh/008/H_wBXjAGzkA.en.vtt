00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:08.040
 Hi, I'm Daiana Slender and today 

00:00:06.149 --> 00:00:10.710
 let's do a hairstyle called 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:13.920
 sweet rolls for this we are going to use 

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:16.349
 first the hair completely smooth I would 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:18.689
 I would recommend that you use the products of 

00:00:16.349 --> 00:00:21.720
 that purple age that are smooth 

00:00:18.689 --> 00:00:23.220
 perfect so when they go to 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:25.859
 start working 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:28.470
 the hairstyle is going to be easier and not 

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:31.169
 will go out frizz this kind of thing then 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:36.150
 they do not see the hairstyle very well 

00:00:31.169 --> 00:00:38.040
 then we start by dividing the hair 

00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:40.620
 the front can do it with 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:44.240
 the hand with a comb or something that 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:44.240
 be provided 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:51.080
 this part 

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:54.190
 we divide it 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:04.760
 as I have to pool then we take 

00:01:00.990 --> 00:01:04.760
 a little more hair 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:20.360
 let's go to the side 

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:37.830
 now we take the other part 

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:39.930
 Y 

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:42.950
 we divide this we can also 

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:42.950
 do with the hand 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:49.890
 to make the main bow the one that goes to 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:52.430
 be the basis of all the hair of all 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:52.430
 the hairstyle 

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:58.550
 we make a roll 

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:14.760
 it does not matter that it is not perfect because 

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:17.240
 You can give your fashion touch to 

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:17.240
 hairstyle 

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:21.300
 after we take it 

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:28.000
 we see a little hand to hold it 

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:36.549
 or we can also do it with hooks 

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:38.909
 to give more strength to the bow that is the 

00:02:36.549 --> 00:02:38.909
 base 

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:48.170
 now 

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:49.780
 to hold that hair that is coming 

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:54.450
 a lot of face 

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:54.450
 now with the part at the bottom 

00:02:55.490 --> 00:03:00.070
 and we started making churrascos 

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:04.140
 It is the one that goes 

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:17.970
 as well 

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:17.970
 The top 

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:28.100
 and it wraps you 

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:28.100
 m 

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:32.750
 and with hooks we hold 

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:40.670
 also today 

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:45.410
 with 

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:48.830
 the perfect smooth espai we did this 

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:51.100
 to 15 centimeters to lower a bit the 

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:51.100
 frizz 

00:03:55.850 --> 00:04:03.390
 and now the front 

00:03:59.020 --> 00:04:03.390
 we comb it we give it shape 

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:10.560
 I search 

00:04:10.710 --> 00:04:13.400
 from many 

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:22.449
 we make the churrasco to finish 

00:04:17.829 --> 00:04:25.030
 and so you will get a hairstyle 

00:04:22.449 --> 00:04:28.259
 elegant to wear with a dress 

00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:31.650
 cocktail night a hairstyle that is 

00:04:28.259 --> 00:04:36.569
 elaborated perfectly so that they look 

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:36.569
