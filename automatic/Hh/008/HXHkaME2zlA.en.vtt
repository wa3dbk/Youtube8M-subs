one and the quickest you can have is
0.03<00:02:03.719> so<00:02:04.719> that<00:02:05.380> would<00:02:05.530> be<00:02:05.710> like<00:02:06.540> that<00:02:07.540> and

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:08.850 
0.03 so that would be like that and

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:16.040 
0.03 so that would be like that and
that's<00:02:09.850> like<00:02:10.380> really<00:02:11.380> really<00:02:11.620> quick

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:16.050 

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:19.370 

so<00:02:16.680> you<00:02:17.520> type<00:02:17.820> in<00:02:17.970> whatever<00:02:18.420> you<00:02:18.690> wanted<00:02:19.080> and

you'd be it would be whatever that
wasn't<00:02:21.540> series<00:02:21.930> or<00:02:22.250> three<00:02:23.390> this<00:02:24.390> that's<00:02:24.840> zero

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:25.350 
wasn't series or three this that's zero

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:28.190 
wasn't series or three this that's zero
there's<00:02:25.590> right<00:02:26.030> it's<00:02:27.030> you<00:02:27.510> know<00:02:27.600> it's<00:02:27.900> very

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:28.200 
there's right it's you know it's very

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:31.160 
there's right it's you know it's very
very<00:02:28.350> short<00:02:28.710> that<00:02:29.480> would<00:02:30.480> be<00:02:30.600> only<00:02:30.780> four<00:02:30.990> quick

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:31.170 
very short that would be only four quick

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:33.800 
very short that would be only four quick
movements<00:02:31.740> in<00:02:32.160> animation<00:02:32.910> if<00:02:33.300> you<00:02:33.390> add<00:02:33.570> music

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:33.810 
movements in animation if you add music

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:35.960 
movements in animation if you add music
that<00:02:34.260> would<00:02:34.410> be<00:02:34.560> add<00:02:34.890> music<00:02:35.400> at<00:02:35.670> the<00:02:35.730> current

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:35.970 
that would be add music at the current

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:37.430 
that would be add music at the current
point<00:02:36.120> that<00:02:36.480> would<00:02:36.600> just<00:02:36.780> be<00:02:36.870> wherever<00:02:37.080> that

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:37.440 
point that would just be wherever that

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:40.700 
point that would just be wherever that
big<00:02:37.620> line<00:02:37.830> is<00:02:38.070> if<00:02:38.700> you<00:02:38.850> just<00:02:39.000> add<00:02:39.150> music<00:02:39.710> that

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:40.710 
big line is if you just add music that

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:43.010 
big line is if you just add music that
would<00:02:40.800> be<00:02:40.950> at<00:02:41.040> the<00:02:41.160> very<00:02:41.310> start<00:02:41.850> of<00:02:41.940> it<00:02:42.120> that'll

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:43.020 
would be at the very start of it that'll

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:45.770 
would be at the very start of it that'll
go<00:02:43.110> automatically<00:02:43.560> to<00:02:43.650> the<00:02:43.800> start<00:02:44.040> so<00:02:44.510> yeah

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:45.780 
go automatically to the start so yeah

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:48.200 
go automatically to the start so yeah
you<00:02:46.410> can't<00:02:46.680> fast<00:02:47.100> forward<00:02:47.520> in<00:02:47.670> this<00:02:47.850> and<00:02:48.150> you

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:48.210 
you can't fast forward in this and you

00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:49.730 
you can't fast forward in this and you
can't<00:02:48.390> overlap<00:02:48.810> music<00:02:49.230> like<00:02:49.350> you<00:02:49.470> couldn't

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:49.740 
can't overlap music like you couldn't

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:51.770 
can't overlap music like you couldn't
Windows<00:02:50.160> Movie<00:02:50.340> Maker<00:02:50.460> so<00:02:50.850> you'd<00:02:51.330> probably<00:02:51.450> be

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:51.780 
Windows Movie Maker so you'd probably be

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:54.410 
Windows Movie Maker so you'd probably be
better<00:02:51.900> downloading<00:02:52.530> that<00:02:52.650> too<00:02:53.180> this<00:02:54.180> is

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:54.420 
better downloading that too this is

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:56.300 
better downloading that too this is
effects<00:02:55.170> going<00:02:55.650> into<00:02:55.890> light

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:56.310 
effects going into light

00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:59.420 
effects going into light
what<00:02:56.640> changes<00:02:57.090> into<00:02:58.130> so<00:02:59.130> that<00:02:59.250> will<00:02:59.370> probably

00:02:59.420 --> 00:02:59.430 
what changes into so that will probably

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:01.130 
what changes into so that will probably
be<00:02:59.700> better<00:02:59.850> for<00:02:59.970> things<00:03:00.270> like<00:03:00.360> this<00:03:00.600> so<00:03:00.840> you<00:03:00.930> go

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:01.140 
be better for things like this so you go

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:03.700 
be better for things like this so you go
like<00:03:01.350> that

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:03.710 

00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:06.920 

then<00:03:05.150> yeah<00:03:06.150> I'm<00:03:06.270> gonna<00:03:06.390> get<00:03:06.540> way<00:03:06.630> bit<00:03:06.780> longer

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:06.930 
then yeah I'm gonna get way bit longer

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:15.080 
then yeah I'm gonna get way bit longer
so<00:03:07.140> you<00:03:07.230> can<00:03:07.320> see<00:03:07.470> what<00:03:07.590> happens<00:03:12.020> with<00:03:13.880> ya<00:03:14.880> so

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:15.090 
so you can see what happens with ya so

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:17.450 
so you can see what happens with ya so
that<00:03:15.240> like<00:03:15.420> feeds<00:03:15.720> into<00:03:15.930> additionally<00:03:16.530> you

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:17.460 
that like feeds into additionally you

00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:19.940 
that like feeds into additionally you
have<00:03:17.580> many<00:03:18.480> things<00:03:18.750> new<00:03:19.380> effects<00:03:19.680> for<00:03:19.800> like

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:19.950 
have many things new effects for like

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:22.940 
have many things new effects for like
the<00:03:20.070> picture<00:03:20.630> so<00:03:21.630> yeah<00:03:21.870> they<00:03:22.140> have<00:03:22.320> various

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:22.950 
the picture so yeah they have various

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:25.850 
the picture so yeah they have various
ones<00:03:23.190> there<00:03:23.570> give<00:03:24.570> some<00:03:24.780> new<00:03:24.930> ones<00:03:25.110> mostly

ones there give some new ones mostly

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:30.890 
ones there give some new ones mostly
it's<00:03:26.010> the<00:03:26.040> same<00:03:26.280> as<00:03:26.430> menders<00:03:26.790> moviemaker<00:03:29.900> so

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:30.900 
it's the same as menders moviemaker so

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:35.740 
it's the same as menders moviemaker so

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:51.690 
you how to run it like fades in and put
a<00:03:49.060> defect<00:03:49.420> on<00:03:49.540> this<00:03:50.130> here's<00:03:51.130> brightness<00:03:51.550> as

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:51.700 
a defect on this here's brightness as

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:53.520 
a defect on this here's brightness as
well<00:03:51.849> brightness<00:03:52.330> those<00:03:52.750> various<00:03:53.230> different

00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:53.530 
well brightness those various different

just do that so that's how it plays if I

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:04.410 
just do that so that's how it plays if I
did<00:04:02.650> lose<00:04:02.860> brightness<00:04:03.280> and<00:04:03.640> that's<00:04:04.239> how<00:04:04.360> you

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:04.420

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:15.690 
animation if you need more questions
just<00:04:12.430> ask<00:04:12.580> see<00:04:13.569> ya
