00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:41.520
 I was with my girlfriend, I'll go 

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:43.799

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:47.340
 This is how we shine here. 

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:50.310

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:52.799
 does brown really mean why it will be 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:54.060
 of this illuminati triangle and why 

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:57.060

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:16.440

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:23.310

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:25.440
