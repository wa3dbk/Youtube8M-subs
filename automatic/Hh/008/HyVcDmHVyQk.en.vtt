Forrest Forrest Forrest okay shouldn't
be<00:00:41.730> too<00:00:41.760> hard<00:00:43.970> and<00:00:44.970> i<00:00:45.090> like<00:00:45.240> that<00:00:45.330> i<00:00:45.420> drew<00:00:45.570> an

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660 
be too hard and i like that i drew an

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:49.670 
be too hard and i like that i drew an
island<00:00:45.990> it's<00:00:46.140> one<00:00:46.320> land<00:00:46.620> closer<00:00:47.010> to<00:00:47.310> not<00:00:48.680> to

island it's one land closer to not to

00:00:49.680 --> 00:01:04.610 
island it's one land closer to not to
flipping<00:00:50.310> basically<00:00:53.540> no<00:00:54.540> reveals<00:01:03.290> so<00:01:04.290> he<00:01:04.440> has

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:04.620 
flipping basically no reveals so he has

00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:12.710 
flipping basically no reveals so he has
forest<00:01:05.550> forest<00:01:05.910> oring<00:01:11.540> pretty<00:01:12.540> sure<00:01:12.630> it's

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
forest forest oring pretty sure it's

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:21.740 
forest forest oring pretty sure it's
ponder<00:01:13.020> here<00:01:19.850> so<00:01:20.850> we're<00:01:21.240> going<00:01:21.300> to<00:01:21.420> put<00:01:21.479> vapor

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750
