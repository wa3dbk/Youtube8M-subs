 Green Ninja! Green Ninja! Teach your child to stay clean! 

00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:08.800
 Green Ninja! Green Ninja! Need to build a benevolent team! 

00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:11.500
 Green Ninja! Green Ninja! Cycling, recycling and reuse! 

00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:15.800
 Green Ninja! Green Ninja! Until we do it, it will never stop! 

00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:18.179
 Green Ninja!

 In this episode of the Green Ninja Show, Mina from India, Pim Warham said: 

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
 I am really worried, we made so much garbage. 

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.840
 Sometimes, I feel very scared 

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:31.500
 Mina, your concern about waste is to have no garbage. 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:35.500
 Mina, your concern about waste generation is that there is no garbage [whispering] 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:37.980
 But don’t feel scared 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:41.559
 Here is a perfect example of who has overcome the fear 

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:47.260
 Of course, I used to throw things. I mean, everyone is the same. 

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:53.000
 So I don't know why it happened to me. 

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:59.500
 At first, I thought it was just my imagination. 

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:03.500
 I always feel that I am being tracked. 

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:08.000
 No matter where I go, I can't get rid of this feeling. 

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.670
 When I woke up to sleep, 

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:16.000
 It is like a part of my past lurking in the dark 

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:22.000
 Then one day, the secret is getting bigger and bigger to hide. 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:26.000
 I tried to ignore it, but it just got worse. 

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:31.500
 The things I throw away are following me everywhere! 

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:39.000
 Try to control yourself, sir 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.689
 You are not the only one who throws things. 

00:01:43.689 --> 00:01:50.219
 The earth is like an island with limited space. The more you consume, the more space you will be wasted 

00:01:50.219 --> 00:01:55.740
 We can never get rid of the rubbish! However, there are some that we can do. 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:02:02.000
 The more we can reduce, reuse and recycle, the more we can reduce waste. 

00:02:05.869 --> 00:02:08.500
 The less garbage we produce, the less we don’t have to worry 

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:11.000
 Garbage will always follow us 

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:19.720
 Since that day, I paid attention when I lost my garbage. 

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:26.000
 I know that I will never completely get rid of these rubbish following me, but I believe that the garbage that follows me must be less. 

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:29.000
 Do you understand this? 

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:34.500
 We should not... "reject" waste that has the potential to be recycled and reused. 

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:37.310
 These puns kill me, partner. 

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:45.000
