00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:14.480
 always places that missed 

00:00:12.260 --> 00:00:16.700
 I always felt I was sold poorly 

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:18.980
 within a certain niche of 

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:20.570
 entertainment and fill this 

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:22.310
 need just opening my own 

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:26.420
 place then have to look with the ages 

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:28.070
 in new leaf in the city full of folds 

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:29.960
 So in the flat city you can 

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:32.960
 capture at the first glance of a 

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:35.180
 About this time, we started to discuss or see 

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:36.830
 this emergence of the love of land for 

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:38.600
 that the pride of being Paulista 

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:41.300
 When I left the house, I got nothing. 

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:43.670
 connected and that's okay. 

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:45.800
 way that was how I found a 

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:47.390
 place and because I'm a lover of 

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:48.409
 I've always been raised here is an issue 

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:50.510
 territorial 

00:00:48.409 --> 00:00:52.159
 I went to discover these little gems 

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:56.050
 these little little treasures 

00:00:52.159 --> 00:00:56.050
 hidden inside the city 

00:01:00.219 --> 00:01:05.059
 is the aesthetic that we have found for 

00:01:03.289 --> 00:01:07.040
 the yacht was a fassbinder movie 

00:01:05.059 --> 00:01:09.560
 called who the hell tells the story 

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:11.479
 of a card in a bathroom and ended up 

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:13.280
 in love and all this story 

00:01:11.479 --> 00:01:15.170
 happens inside a ship the people 

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:17.570
 created a place that for all sides 

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:19.670
 where you look so you had not 

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:23.800
 a thematic space plus an ambience 

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:23.800
 What are the bars? 

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:46.420
 the initial proposal when the bar April 

00:01:44.259 --> 00:01:48.729
 it was precisely this that transformed what 

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:50.860
 it was an old one to take over the slaughterhouse with 

00:01:48.729 --> 00:01:52.420
 pieces with clews with all that the 

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:55.299
 people had found sandwich in the 

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:57.819
 the back of the property in a bar 

00:01:55.299 --> 00:02:00.520
 rock rescue the past and look at the 

00:01:57.819 --> 00:02:03.000
 past without nostalgia and dimensionality in 

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:03.000
 gift 

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:22.780
 the hall where we meet 

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:25.930
 was originally a 

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:28.870
 gentlemen and the name there is a bit of 

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:31.140
 a parody of a joke with this club 

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:31.140
 gentlemen 

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:40.190
 there I used as a reference one of those 

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:42.230
 optical groups and wore in the 19th 

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:45.140
 maintains a whole track in 3d using 

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:46.940
 8 bit graphics to create this impression 

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:48.800
 that you have a clue where you have 

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:51.290
 an infinite tip depth 

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:53.720
 obviously the anti-smoking law was our 

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:56.300
 balcony Veron super competitive actor 

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:58.340
 because nobody in sÃ£o paulo has a 

00:02:56.300 --> 00:03:01.610
 varied as ours, which makes it 

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:03.710
 that the club experience is less than 

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:05.570
 club than the most 

00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:07.730
 underground music oriented 

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:09.620
 and become one more club in the 

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:18.980
 reality of today's networks 

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:20.510
 that your exchange is the agent 

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:21.860
 called a plastic artist called 

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:23.630
 kleber matheus who also has a 

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:26.150
 very strong work over neon and the 

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:28.010
 he created his work harmonized with 

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:41.690
 the neons something if we made a big 

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:43.160
 neon gallery and this ambience in the 

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:45.200
 the end of the day was what made the 

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:47.120
 people had a prize in 2010 for a 

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:49.460
 design magazine about known to the 

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:51.520
 pp as one of the coolest places in 

00:03:49.460 --> 00:03:51.520
 world 

00:03:57.830 --> 00:04:06.170
 the antipathy jewel of that in icon 

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:08.000
 classic diamond place is called already 

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:10.460
 because his architecture is a 

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:12.080
 architecture of the 1940s by bisar 

00:04:10.460 --> 00:04:14.570
 it was built as if it were a 

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:16.310
 we even got this diamond 

00:04:14.570 --> 00:04:18.799
 diamond element was exploding by 

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:21.380
 places and resizing your 

00:04:18.799 --> 00:04:23.060
 I use the old one then joel that the 

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:26.000
 original it served as a pole 

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:27.140
 of SÃ£o Paulo's cinephiles. 

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:37.010
 people decided to do the same thing 

00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:38.450
 adding people who like music and 

00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:40.070
 now, for example, what comes next is the 

00:04:38.450 --> 00:04:42.470
 club already this season has hired more 

00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:46.190
 mature and I miss a place one 

00:04:42.470 --> 00:04:48.139
 little more friendly as I can 

00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:55.520
 play and order 

00:04:48.139 --> 00:04:58.669
 I ate a good chef and they all are 

00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:59.599
 of particular ways love poem is 

00:04:58.669 --> 00:05:01.969
 Sao Paulo 

00:04:59.599 --> 00:05:04.610
 if you are a paulistano the city of 

00:05:01.969 --> 00:05:07.819
 cable center would not vote for you 

00:05:04.610 --> 00:05:11.060
 multiplies and is with artificial costumes 

00:05:07.819 --> 00:05:12.949
 km is a manifestation of people and I am not 

00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:14.930
 only me but everyone not only are 

00:05:12.949 --> 00:05:17.090
 people who work what a city is 

00:05:14.930 --> 00:05:19.580
 where he lived with curious before 

00:05:17.090 --> 00:05:21.800
 Nothing in this city, the minute, the whole time. 

00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:23.689
 the city holds a thread and while the 

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:27.510
 people have a space to do things 

00:05:23.689 --> 00:05:29.490
 cool always true 

00:05:27.510 --> 00:05:31.680
 contact the city and she will find 

00:05:29.490 --> 00:05:33.770
 faithful to me every day is very 

00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:33.770
 defeat
