00:01:58.360 --> 00:01:58.370 
they might just actually choose to make

fighting for their abortion rights

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:09.999 
fighting for their abortion rights
people<00:02:08.450> do<00:02:08.689> want<00:02:08.899> to<00:02:08.929> make<00:02:09.079> their<00:02:09.439> cases<00:02:09.890> in

00:02:09.999 --> 00:02:10.009 
people do want to make their cases in

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:12.190 
people do want to make their cases in
different<00:02:10.340> ways<00:02:10.489> but<00:02:11.299> is<00:02:11.569> it<00:02:11.840> really

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:12.200 
different ways but is it really

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:13.630 
different ways but is it really
something<00:02:12.530> that<00:02:12.590> should<00:02:12.650> be<00:02:12.920> against<00:02:13.370> the

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:13.640 
something that should be against the

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:15.340 
something that should be against the
I<00:02:13.700> don't<00:02:14.030> personally<00:02:14.510> think<00:02:14.840> that<00:02:14.960> a<00:02:15.110> company

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:15.350 
I don't personally think that a company

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:18.340 
I don't personally think that a company
should<00:02:15.860> have<00:02:15.890> to<00:02:16.430> be<00:02:16.550> forced<00:02:17.120> to<00:02:17.270> express<00:02:18.050> some

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:18.350 
should have to be forced to express some

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:20.949 
should have to be forced to express some
views<00:02:18.800> that<00:02:19.130> they<00:02:19.340> really<00:02:20.209> genuinely<00:02:20.390> oppose

00:02:20.949 --> 00:02:20.959 
views that they really genuinely oppose

00:02:20.959 --> 00:02:22.780 
views that they really genuinely oppose
I<00:02:21.260> agree<00:02:21.620> it's<00:02:21.800> it's<00:02:22.040> so<00:02:22.280> interesting<00:02:22.580> because

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:22.790 
I agree it's it's so interesting because

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:24.190 
I agree it's it's so interesting because
it<00:02:23.000> does<00:02:23.150> set<00:02:23.360> up<00:02:23.480> a<00:02:23.600> dangerous<00:02:23.990> precedent

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:24.200 
it does set up a dangerous precedent

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:25.780 
it does set up a dangerous precedent
potentially<00:02:24.920> down<00:02:25.040> the<00:02:25.220> line<00:02:25.400> for<00:02:25.670> other

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:25.790 
potentially down the line for other

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:28.240 
potentially down the line for other
companies<00:02:26.030> to<00:02:26.300> be<00:02:26.390> compelled<00:02:26.990> to<00:02:27.740> engage<00:02:27.890> in<00:02:28.190> a

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:28.250 
companies to be compelled to engage in a

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:29.559 
companies to be compelled to engage in a
certain<00:02:28.490> form<00:02:28.730> of<00:02:28.819> expression<00:02:29.330> that<00:02:29.420> they

00:02:29.559 --> 00:02:29.569 
certain form of expression that they

00:02:29.569 --> 00:02:32.199 
certain form of expression that they
themselves<00:02:29.750> don't<00:02:30.140> want<00:02:30.440> to<00:02:30.740> engage<00:02:31.010> in<00:02:31.220> but

00:02:32.199 --> 00:02:32.209 
themselves don't want to engage in but

00:02:32.209 --> 00:02:33.760 
themselves don't want to engage in but
anybody<00:02:32.480> looking<00:02:32.959> at<00:02:33.080> this<00:02:33.170> case<00:02:33.410> would<00:02:33.620> say

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:33.770 
anybody looking at this case would say

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:35.380 
anybody looking at this case would say
just<00:02:34.070> bake<00:02:34.280> them<00:02:34.310> the<00:02:34.610> cake<00:02:34.790> you<00:02:35.120> know<00:02:35.240> what<00:02:35.330> I

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:35.390 
just bake them the cake you know what I

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:36.970 
just bake them the cake you know what I
mean<00:02:35.510> like<00:02:35.630> it's<00:02:35.810> not<00:02:35.930> a<00:02:35.990> big<00:02:36.230> deal

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:36.980 
mean like it's not a big deal

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:39.640 
mean like it's not a big deal
print<00:02:37.459> the<00:02:37.550> thing<00:02:37.730> but<00:02:37.910> it<00:02:38.840> does<00:02:39.110> get<00:02:39.530> into

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:39.650 
print the thing but it does get into

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:41.260 
print the thing but it does get into
murky<00:02:39.980> territory<00:02:40.430> when<00:02:40.640> you<00:02:40.760> say<00:02:40.970> well<00:02:41.239> I

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:41.270 
murky territory when you say well I

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:43.570 
murky territory when you say well I
agree<00:02:41.570> with<00:02:42.230> the<00:02:42.530> customers<00:02:43.220> and<00:02:43.250> what<00:02:43.430> they

00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:43.580 
agree with the customers and what they

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:45.340 
agree with the customers and what they
want<00:02:43.760> to<00:02:43.850> put<00:02:43.940> on<00:02:44.000> the<00:02:44.180> cake<00:02:44.360> potentially<00:02:44.900> but

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:45.350 
want to put on the cake potentially but

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:47.800 
want to put on the cake potentially but
I<00:02:45.410> don't<00:02:45.770> necessarily<00:02:46.100> agree<00:02:46.670> that<00:02:47.000> vendors

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:47.810 
I don't necessarily agree that vendors

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:49.300 
I don't necessarily agree that vendors
should<00:02:48.170> be<00:02:48.350> forced<00:02:48.680> to<00:02:48.739> do<00:02:48.890> something<00:02:49.070> that

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:49.310 
should be forced to do something that

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:50.830 
should be forced to do something that
they<00:02:49.430> don't<00:02:49.459> which<00:02:49.940> might<00:02:50.180> be<00:02:50.330> the<00:02:50.570> bigger

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:50.840 
they don't which might be the bigger

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:52.420 
they don't which might be the bigger
fight<00:02:51.170> that<00:02:51.440> is<00:02:51.590> happening<00:02:51.920> here<00:02:51.980> and<00:02:52.190> clearly

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:52.430 
fight that is happening here and clearly

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:54.400 
fight that is happening here and clearly
that's<00:02:52.670> what<00:02:52.850> this<00:02:53.510> activist<00:02:53.900> lawyer<00:02:54.110> is

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:54.410 
that's what this activist lawyer is

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:56.110 
that's what this activist lawyer is
pushing<00:02:54.560> for<00:02:54.890> and<00:02:55.370> when<00:02:55.550> you<00:02:55.640> then<00:02:55.790> think<00:02:56.000> of

00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:56.120 
pushing for and when you then think of

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:58.090 
pushing for and when you then think of
cases<00:02:56.480> like<00:02:56.600> Charlie<00:02:56.989> Hebdo<00:02:57.140> and<00:02:57.380> the

00:02:58.090 --> 00:02:58.100 
cases like Charlie Hebdo and the

00:02:58.100 --> 00:02:59.680 
cases like Charlie Hebdo and the

cases where religion can be involved and
