you're<00:02:21.360> going<00:02:21.480> to<00:02:21.540> twist<00:02:21.810> the<00:02:22.129> tiny<00:02:23.129> end<00:02:23.430> cap

00:02:23.809 --> 00:02:23.819 
you're going to twist the tiny end cap

00:02:23.819 --> 00:02:26.509 
you're going to twist the tiny end cap
off<00:02:24.090> here<00:02:24.510> and<00:02:25.379> I'll<00:02:25.530> show<00:02:25.769> you<00:02:25.830> as<00:02:26.190> it<00:02:26.340> comes

now<00:02:33.299> I'm<00:02:33.360> not<00:02:33.480> sure<00:02:33.689> if<00:02:33.959> it<00:02:34.079> is<00:02:34.110> supposed<00:02:34.439> to

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:34.560 
now I'm not sure if it is supposed to

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:37.970 
now I'm not sure if it is supposed to
stay<00:02:34.799> fixed<00:02:35.730> in<00:02:35.879> this<00:02:36.120> little<00:02:36.420> notch<00:02:36.599> you<00:02:36.989> can

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:37.980 
stay fixed in this little notch you can

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:39.380 
stay fixed in this little notch you can
see<00:02:38.250> there<00:02:38.459> or<00:02:38.640> not<00:02:38.819> but<00:02:39.060> it<00:02:39.120> doesn't<00:02:39.299> really

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:39.390 
see there or not but it doesn't really

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:40.399 
see there or not but it doesn't really
make<00:02:39.510> a<00:02:39.569> difference<00:02:39.719> actually<00:02:40.049> find<00:02:40.349> it

00:02:40.399 --> 00:02:40.409 
make a difference actually find it

00:02:40.409 --> 00:02:42.800 
make a difference actually find it
easier<00:02:40.709> to<00:02:40.859> use<00:02:40.890> when<00:02:41.189> it's<00:02:41.310> outside<00:02:41.760> of<00:02:42.060> the

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:42.810 
easier to use when it's outside of the

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:44.660 
easier to use when it's outside of the
notch<00:02:42.959> not<00:02:43.290> connected<00:02:43.739> to<00:02:43.769> this<00:02:43.980> end<00:02:44.189> cap<00:02:44.400> but

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:44.670 
notch not connected to this end cap but

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:47.979 
notch not connected to this end cap but
as<00:02:45.329> your<00:02:45.510> striker<00:02:45.840> and<00:02:46.260> your<00:02:46.799> end<00:02:46.950> cap<00:02:47.159> and

00:02:47.979 --> 00:02:47.989 
as your striker and your end cap and

00:02:47.989 --> 00:02:51.530 
as your striker and your end cap and
then<00:02:48.989> you're<00:02:49.349> going<00:02:49.500> to<00:02:49.560> twist<00:02:50.129> this<00:02:50.540> section

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:51.540 
then you're going to twist this section

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:57.020 
then you're going to twist this section
here<00:02:53.480> so<00:02:54.480> here<00:02:55.319> is<00:02:55.470> your<00:02:55.709> pen<00:02:56.220> down<00:02:56.730> on<00:02:56.879> this

00:03:49.719 --> 00:03:49.729 
take a listen so that obviously

00:03:49.729 --> 00:03:53.420 
take a listen so that obviously
functions<00:03:50.930> and<00:03:51.930> then<00:03:52.680> we've<00:03:52.859> got<00:03:52.979> the<00:03:53.159> Ferro

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:53.430 
functions and then we've got the Ferro

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:56.300 
functions and then we've got the Ferro
rod<00:03:53.549> down<00:03:54.000> here<00:03:54.299> and<00:03:54.479> you<00:03:55.079> can<00:03:55.229> see<00:03:55.500> that<00:03:56.220> I

00:03:56.310 --> 00:03:58.640 
rod down here and you can see that I
have<00:03:56.459> scraped<00:03:56.849> off<00:03:57.139> some<00:03:58.139> of<00:03:58.169> the<00:03:58.379> black

00:03:58.640 --> 00:03:58.650 
have scraped off some of the black

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:00.979 
have scraped off some of the black
coating<00:03:59.310> and<00:03:59.459> that<00:03:59.519> actually<00:04:00.150> just<00:04:00.720> makes<00:04:00.900> it

00:04:00.979 --> 00:04:00.989 
coating and that actually just makes it

00:04:00.989 --> 00:04:04.129 
coating and that actually just makes it
easier<00:04:01.319> to<00:04:01.500> to<00:04:02.489> get<00:04:02.639> your<00:04:02.729> spark<00:04:03.090> and<00:04:03.840> I'll<00:04:04.019> get

00:04:04.129 --> 00:04:04.139 
easier to to get your spark and I'll get

00:04:04.139 --> 00:04:06.589 
easier to to get your spark and I'll get
the<00:04:04.260> striker<00:04:04.560> right<00:04:04.829> here<00:04:05.159> I<00:04:05.340> want<00:04:06.299> to<00:04:06.479> move

00:04:06.589 --> 00:04:06.599 
the striker right here I want to move

00:04:06.599 --> 00:04:07.699 
the striker right here I want to move
those<00:04:06.720> items<00:04:07.019> out<00:04:07.109> of<00:04:07.169> the<00:04:07.260> way<00:04:07.349> so<00:04:07.409> you<00:04:07.620> could

00:04:07.699 --> 00:04:07.709 
those items out of the way so you could

00:04:07.709 --> 00:04:09.439 
those items out of the way so you could
see<00:04:07.919> more<00:04:08.069> clearly<00:04:08.310> with<00:04:08.639> this<00:04:08.760> black

00:04:09.439 --> 00:04:09.449 
see more clearly with this black

00:04:09.449 --> 00:04:11.420 
see more clearly with this black
background<00:04:09.690> and<00:04:10.169> we'll<00:04:10.680> do<00:04:10.829> a<00:04:10.859> couple<00:04:11.040> strikes

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:11.430 
background and we'll do a couple strikes

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:16.849 
background and we'll do a couple strikes
here<00:04:14.720> so<00:04:15.720> you<00:04:15.840> can<00:04:16.049> see<00:04:16.169> it<00:04:16.260> obviously<00:04:16.500> works<00:04:16.709> I

00:04:16.849 --> 00:04:16.859 
here so you can see it obviously works I

00:04:16.859 --> 00:04:18.529 
here so you can see it obviously works I
found<00:04:17.070> the<00:04:17.130> best<00:04:17.250> way<00:04:17.400> to<00:04:17.430> do<00:04:17.609> it<00:04:17.760> is<00:04:17.880> two

00:04:18.529 --> 00:04:18.539 
found the best way to do it is two

00:04:18.539 --> 00:04:20.060 
found the best way to do it is two
fingers<00:04:18.750> like<00:04:19.019> this<00:04:19.169> and<00:04:19.380> then<00:04:19.590> your<00:04:19.739> thumb

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:20.070 
fingers like this and then your thumb

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:22.640 
fingers like this and then your thumb
and<00:04:20.310> then<00:04:20.669> run<00:04:21.510> it<00:04:21.599> across<00:04:21.690> your<00:04:22.079> Ferro<00:04:22.320> rod<00:04:22.409> or

00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:22.650 
and then run it across your Ferro rod or

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:24.140 
and then run it across your Ferro rod or
pull<00:04:22.860> you're<00:04:23.010> fair<00:04:23.190> run<00:04:23.400> back<00:04:23.610> depend<00:04:23.940> on<00:04:24.000> how

00:04:24.140 --> 00:04:24.150 
pull you're fair run back depend on how

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:27.110

00:05:07.159 --> 00:05:07.169 
go camping this weekend and so I'll

00:05:07.169 --> 00:05:09.260 
go camping this weekend and so I'll
bring<00:05:07.349> this<00:05:07.499> as<00:05:07.680> my<00:05:07.800> Ferro<00:05:08.159> rod<00:05:08.279> you<00:05:09.240> know

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:09.270 
bring this as my Ferro rod you know

00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:10.969 
bring this as my Ferro rod you know
using<00:05:09.659> a<00:05:09.719> lighter<00:05:09.930> a<00:05:10.050> bigger<00:05:10.379> fair<00:05:10.740> rod

00:05:10.969 --> 00:05:10.979 
using a lighter a bigger fair rod

00:05:10.979 --> 00:05:12.820 
using a lighter a bigger fair rod
something<00:05:11.339> like<00:05:11.430> that<00:05:11.580> it's<00:05:11.729> much<00:05:11.849> easier<00:05:12.300> to

00:05:12.820 --> 00:05:12.830 
something like that it's much easier to

00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:15.379 
something like that it's much easier to
employ<00:05:13.830> but<00:05:14.399> this<00:05:14.639> I<00:05:14.819> think<00:05:14.849> is<00:05:15.059> so<00:05:15.180> cool

00:05:15.379 --> 00:05:15.389 
employ but this I think is so cool

00:05:15.389 --> 00:05:16.699 
employ but this I think is so cool
because<00:05:15.599> you<00:05:15.839> can<00:05:15.869> carry<00:05:16.139> this<00:05:16.259> around<00:05:16.409> all

00:05:16.699 --> 00:05:16.709 
because you can carry this around all

00:05:16.709 --> 00:05:18.199 
because you can carry this around all
the<00:05:16.860> time<00:05:16.889> you<00:05:17.189> can<00:05:17.339> have<00:05:17.459> it<00:05:17.580> in<00:05:17.669> your<00:05:17.819> pocket

00:05:18.199 --> 00:05:18.209 
the time you can have it in your pocket

00:05:18.209 --> 00:05:19.909 
the time you can have it in your pocket
and<00:05:18.240> your<00:05:18.539> pack<00:05:18.749> whatever<00:05:18.990> it<00:05:19.229> is<00:05:19.319> you<00:05:19.830> know

00:05:19.909 --> 00:05:19.919 
and your pack whatever it is you know

00:05:19.919 --> 00:05:22.070 
and your pack whatever it is you know
just<00:05:20.099> going<00:05:20.279> around<00:05:20.430> day<00:05:20.999> to<00:05:21.059> day<00:05:21.270> in<00:05:21.509> life<00:05:21.749> and

00:05:22.070 --> 00:05:22.080 
just going around day to day in life and

00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:23.659 
just going around day to day in life and
then<00:05:22.469> if<00:05:22.589> something<00:05:22.770> came<00:05:23.039> up<00:05:23.069> when<00:05:23.339> you<00:05:23.430> found

00:05:23.659 --> 00:05:23.669 
then if something came up when you found

00:05:23.669 --> 00:05:25.070 
then if something came up when you found
yourself<00:05:23.819> in<00:05:24.149> a<00:05:24.180> situation<00:05:24.389> you're<00:05:24.779> like<00:05:24.899> man
