00:00:01.650 --> 00:00:04.550
 me 

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:13.960
 b 4 

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:18.730
 It was 

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:22.590
 Yeah yeah yeah 

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:30.000
 Hmm 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:31.950
 The car world is about to enter the heyday of the hybrid prop 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:36.510
 That's right yeah 

00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:41.190
 Are you in here to open Toyota I am propose you everyone is a hybrid 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:41.580
 It is true that it is striking the hybrid second in Japan 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:47.340
 Also 

00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:48.000
 We are steadily increasing the number of car models again This third generation released in September 2013 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:51.940
 fit 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:55.600
 This even if there are orders of more than 60,000 units in one month since its release 

00:00:51.940 --> 00:01:00.910
 In addition, 70% of them are the first ever popular hybrids 

00:00:55.600 --> 00:01:04.780
 Now the atmosphere of the fit but I'm fit for this third stage everyone well your Zonchi 

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:08.140
 I like what has become sharper on it but it is still 

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:11.870
 Then a line of deep auri running noodles 

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:13.700
 It is expressing a sharp view of the whole body 

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:18.619
 To Aqua against 

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:21.619
 Not really go against the flow of the air and everyone is as well understood was this to see 

00:01:18.619 --> 00:01:27.259
 It features the aerodynamic lines, such as 

00:01:21.619 --> 00:01:32.509
 It's soft and it's a soft mood After all Toyota that seeks a good sense of balance in everything around 

00:01:27.259 --> 00:01:33.720
 And then I would like to pursue crisp running after all Honda's somehow different atmosphere 

00:01:32.509 --> 00:01:38.610
 It may have come out 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:41.940
 Yes, this is the new fit hybrid hybrid room 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:46.040
 This is a 1.5 liter 4-cylinder engine 

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:50.330
 There is a transmission and a motor in the place which can not be seen under this 

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:52.100
 This engine is Me keep power because it is 110hp Atkinson cycle 

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:57.920
 There is also a view 

00:01:52.100 --> 00:02:02.420
 Then the motor is 29.5 hp and the disguise is 7-speed dcp clutch 

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:04.940
 Recently a European sport type with 2 sets of clutches called transmission 

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:06.030
 It is something that has begun to enter 

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:09.390
 Fit hybrid 

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:12.770
 I think it's a bit tedious to say that it is only for 3 

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:18.050
 Yes this is the aqua magazine 

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:22.820
 If you look at this video, I think there are many who think that it looked like somewhere 

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:25.970
 That's right, it's mostly something inherited from the second Prius 

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:30.350
 However, this 1.5 liter 4-cylinder engine 

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:32.760
 Fine the variously improved the place has become as much as it can be said that the nascent type performance 

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:36.480
 The output is 74 horsepower displacement 

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:38.790
 That amount very margin but speed is limited Gu' and power power to 

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:43.980
 It features a lot of sense of rotation 

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:49.470
 And the motor is much stronger than the 611hp reverse fit and this 

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:52.780
 System power comes out in combination engine and motor after high school 100 horsepower 

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:58.270
 If there is a fit, it is 137 hp 

00:02:52.780 --> 00:03:01.130
 After all the difference in thinking of that side whether it emphasizes the run emphasis or the omnidirectional balance sense 

00:02:58.270 --> 00:03:06.440
 Yeah in you may have a little appears 

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:07.350
 As a result, I think everyone is paying attention to fuel consumption naturally because it is a hybrid 

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:13.170
 What 

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:19.140
 For example, this aqua is considered 35.4 false in jc 08 mode 

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:22.430
 On the other hand, the new Fit Hybrid is a slightly higher class l package 

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:25.870
 But this is 33.6 k 

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:30.140
 In just lighter basic model 

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:33.439
 It has launched a tremendous number of 36.4 kg 

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:39.130
 Yes This is the driver's seat of the new fit hybrid 

00:03:33.439 --> 00:03:45.100
 Although the whole composition is common to all fit though, the feature is 

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:45.790
 The area around the meter is much simpler and simpler than any of the various book hybrids so far 

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:50.740
 I am 

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:56.800
 It is a feature that can be seen at a glance all and then this air conditioner and so on 

00:03:50.740 --> 00:03:58.390
 The navigation audio related panel is completely free 

00:03:56.800 --> 00:03:59.120
 This is an optional internavi 

00:03:58.390 --> 00:04:04.610
 Though it is a set 

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:08.010
 But I think that most people who want to buy this fit will probably choose 

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:09.290
 If then Futore Another is this child 

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:13.700
 This is to 

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:17.090
 In fact, after 7-speed dual clutch transmission this 

00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:18.670
 Share underwater various strike average vehicle speed 

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:22.930
 Or the average fuel consumption 

00:04:18.670 --> 00:04:26.610
 Tachometer comes out in part of them 

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:31.740
 I 'm a little light and easy to use instead 

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:32.310
 I think the sense of acceleration is comparable to the normal 2510 c class in terms of bodily sensation 

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:36.840
 I will 

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:39.020
 I think that it is a finish that I can be convinced that it is not going to be good for a fast-fit fit billboard 

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:39.020
 I will
