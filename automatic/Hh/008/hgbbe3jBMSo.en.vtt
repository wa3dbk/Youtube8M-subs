should be taking advantage of it with

00:00:56.789 --> 00:00:59.479 
should be taking advantage of it with
everything<00:00:57.120> I<00:00:57.360> can<00:00:57.600> so<00:00:57.930> that's<00:00:58.649> why<00:00:58.890> I<00:00:58.920> got<00:00:59.250> it

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
everything I can so that's why I got it

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:03.229 
everything I can so that's why I got it
um<00:00:59.690> obviously<00:01:00.690> this<00:01:01.140> is<00:01:01.320> only<00:01:01.469> 199<00:01:02.370> bucks<00:01:02.670> so

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 
um obviously this is only 199 bucks so

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:05.329 
um obviously this is only 199 bucks so
that<00:01:03.270> doesn't<00:01:03.780> add<00:01:03.989> up<00:01:04.260> to<00:01:04.320> what<00:01:04.979> I<00:01:05.010> would<00:01:05.250> have
