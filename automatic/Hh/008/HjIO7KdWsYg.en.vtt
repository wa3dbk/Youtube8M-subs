00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:29.089 
show you what it's like so when you buy
these<00:00:26.760> gear<00:00:27.390> displays<00:00:27.810> they<00:00:28.170> come<00:00:28.380> with<00:00:28.590> two

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:29.099 
these gear displays they come with two

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:32.030 
these gear displays they come with two
sensors<00:00:29.550> and<00:00:29.820> you<00:00:29.849> get<00:00:30.630> a<00:00:30.660> magnet<00:00:31.080> I've<00:00:31.320> hooked

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:32.040 
sensors and you get a magnet I've hooked

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:34.900 
sensors and you get a magnet I've hooked
the<00:00:32.219> Magnavox<00:00:32.640> I've<00:00:33.239> made<00:00:33.420> this<00:00:33.540> bit<00:00:33.750> of<00:00:33.870> them

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:34.910 
the Magnavox I've made this bit of them

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:38.209 
the Magnavox I've made this bit of them
still<00:00:35.910> here<00:00:36.180> like<00:00:36.450> a<00:00:36.480> bent<00:00:37.050> it<00:00:37.200> and<00:00:37.380> shaped<00:00:37.980> it

00:00:38.209 --> 00:00:38.219 
still here like a bent it and shaped it

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:42.229 
still here like a bent it and shaped it
so<00:00:38.579> it<00:00:38.640> would<00:00:39.980> sit<00:00:40.980> what<00:00:41.460> I<00:00:41.489> needed<00:00:41.820> to<00:00:42.030> do

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:42.239 
so it would sit what I needed to do

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:44.779 
so it would sit what I needed to do
which<00:00:43.200> is<00:00:43.350> off<00:00:43.559> get<00:00:43.890> up<00:00:44.010> to<00:00:44.160> the<00:00:44.280> gear<00:00:44.520> shift

00:00:44.779 --> 00:00:44.789 
which is off get up to the gear shift

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:50.240 
which is off get up to the gear shift
lever<00:00:44.850> and<00:00:45.710> when<00:00:46.710> you<00:00:48.530> move<00:00:49.530> the<00:00:49.710> gear<00:00:49.890> shifter

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 
lever and when you move the gear shifter

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:55.369 
lever and when you move the gear shifter
so<00:00:50.550> does<00:00:51.420> that<00:00:52.340> magnet<00:00:53.340> on<00:00:53.820> the<00:00:53.969> plate<00:00:54.379> now

00:00:55.369 --> 00:00:55.379 
so does that magnet on the plate now

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:57.920 
so does that magnet on the plate now
you've<00:00:55.559> got<00:00:55.739> the<00:00:55.860> center<00:00:56.039> plate<00:00:56.399> here<00:00:56.820> which<00:00:57.809> I

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930 
you've got the center plate here which I

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:01.790 
you've got the center plate here which I
made<00:00:58.170> also<00:00:58.620> I've<00:00:59.579> screwed<00:01:00.030> my<00:01:00.469> sensors<00:01:01.469> on<00:01:01.649> to

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:01.800 
made also I've screwed my sensors on to

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:07.010 
made also I've screwed my sensors on to
it<00:01:03.530> which<00:01:04.530> they<00:01:04.920> all<00:01:05.189> connect<00:01:05.610> up<00:01:05.790> to<00:01:05.820> the<00:01:06.330> main

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
it which they all connect up to the main

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:12.649 
it which they all connect up to the main
part<00:01:07.320> the<00:01:08.189> display<00:01:08.990> and<00:01:10.610> also<00:01:11.610> under<00:01:12.119> here<00:01:12.510> is

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:12.659 
part the display and also under here is

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:17.210 
part the display and also under here is
your<00:01:13.260> neutral<00:01:14.210> sensor<00:01:15.320> you<00:01:16.320> also<00:01:16.680> hook<00:01:16.920> up<00:01:17.070> the

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
your neutral sensor you also hook up the

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:18.760 
your neutral sensor you also hook up the
neutral<00:01:17.610> wire<00:01:17.820> to<00:01:18.210> that

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:18.770 
neutral wire to that

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:22.690 
neutral wire to that
so<00:01:20.210> all<00:01:21.210> bikes<00:01:21.479> will<00:01:21.630> be<00:01:21.720> different<00:01:22.049> I<00:01:22.110> suppose

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:22.700 
so all bikes will be different I suppose

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:26.570 
so all bikes will be different I suppose
but<00:01:23.700> this<00:01:23.909> is<00:01:24.060> a<00:01:24.090> sea<00:01:24.330> bean<00:01:24.570> 400<00:01:25.229> and<00:01:25.580> that's

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580 
but this is a sea bean 400 and that's

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:30.249 
but this is a sea bean 400 and that's
just<00:01:26.850> how<00:01:27.000> I've<00:01:27.150> done<00:01:27.330> it<00:01:28.100> anyway

00:01:30.249 --> 00:01:30.259 
just how I've done it anyway

00:01:30.259 --> 00:01:33.590 
just how I've done it anyway
I'll<00:01:31.259> show<00:01:31.500> you<00:01:31.560> how<00:01:31.680> it<00:01:31.770> works<00:01:32.130> I've<00:01:32.970> run<00:01:33.390> the

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600 
I'll show you how it works I've run the

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:36.850 
I'll show you how it works I've run the
wires<00:01:34.259> for<00:01:34.680> the<00:01:34.740> sensors<00:01:35.189> up<00:01:35.460> around<00:01:35.790> here<00:01:36.360> and

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:36.860 
wires for the sensors up around here and

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:40.910 
wires for the sensors up around here and
through<00:01:37.860> there<00:01:38.250> and<00:01:39.110> hook<00:01:40.110> them<00:01:40.259> all<00:01:40.439> up<00:01:40.650> to

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
through there and hook them all up to

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:44.719 
through there and hook them all up to
the<00:01:41.070> head<00:01:42.060> unit<00:01:42.329> which<00:01:42.780> is<00:01:43.020> up<00:01:43.799> here<00:01:43.860> I've

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:44.729 
the head unit which is up here I've

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:47.690 
the head unit which is up here I've
mounted<00:01:44.970> that<00:01:45.360> just<00:01:45.720> there<00:01:45.960> so<00:01:46.770> Patera

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 
mounted that just there so Patera

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:53.380 
mounted that just there so Patera
there<00:01:48.270> you<00:01:48.390> go<00:01:48.920> and<00:01:49.920> see<00:01:50.159> that<00:01:51.140> first

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:53.390 
there you go and see that first

00:01:53.390 --> 00:02:01.070 
there you go and see that first
second<00:01:54.390> and<00:01:55.580> four<00:01:57.380> fifth<00:01:58.520> six<00:01:59.720> down<00:02:00.720> the<00:02:00.900> gears

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:01.080 
second and four fifth six down the gears

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:08.270 
second and four fifth six down the gears
fifth<00:02:02.480> fourth<00:02:03.480> third<00:02:05.060> second<00:02:06.060> first<00:02:07.280> right

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:08.280 
fifth fourth third second first right

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:10.790 
fifth fourth third second first right
and<00:02:08.580> it's<00:02:09.570> got<00:02:09.810> a<00:02:09.840> neutral<00:02:10.290> sensor<00:02:10.649> as<00:02:10.770> well

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:10.800 
and it's got a neutral sensor as well

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:13.250 
and it's got a neutral sensor as well
you<00:02:11.100> hook<00:02:11.250> up<00:02:11.400> to<00:02:11.640> the<00:02:11.760> neutral<00:02:12.120> switch<00:02:12.390> and

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:13.260 
you hook up to the neutral switch and

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:14.540 
you hook up to the neutral switch and
when<00:02:13.410> it<00:02:13.500> gets<00:02:13.590> the<00:02:13.770> neutral<00:02:14.130> perspective

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:14.550 
when it gets the neutral perspective

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:21.770 
when it gets the neutral perspective
zero<00:02:15.320> heck<00:02:16.320> with<00:02:16.470> that<00:02:18.020> anyway<00:02:20.240> si<00:02:21.240> I've<00:02:21.510> wired

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:21.780 
zero heck with that anyway si I've wired

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:24.950 
zero heck with that anyway si I've wired
it<00:02:22.050> into<00:02:22.440> the<00:02:22.970> headlight<00:02:23.970> circuit<00:02:24.570> so<00:02:24.810> when

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:24.960 
it into the headlight circuit so when

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:28.060 
it into the headlight circuit so when
the<00:02:25.080> head<00:02:25.200> light<00:02:25.410> comes<00:02:25.740> on<00:02:25.980> so<00:02:26.880> does<00:02:27.120> the

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:28.070 
the head light comes on so does the

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:32.570 
the head light comes on so does the
digital<00:02:29.070> display<00:02:29.520> for<00:02:29.940> the<00:02:30.030> gears<00:02:30.950> yeah<00:02:31.950> so<00:02:32.310> I

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:32.580 
digital display for the gears yeah so I

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:35.660 
digital display for the gears yeah so I
made<00:02:33.150> up<00:02:33.180> this<00:02:33.480> little<00:02:33.540> part<00:02:33.990> here<00:02:34.520> about<00:02:35.520> two

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:35.670 
made up this little part here about two

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:40.730 
made up this little part here about two
swirls<00:02:37.640> when<00:02:38.640> you<00:02:38.790> change<00:02:39.090> the<00:02:39.270> gears<00:02:39.560> on<00:02:40.560> to

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:40.740 
swirls when you change the gears on to

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:46.670 
swirls when you change the gears on to
the<00:02:40.860> senses<00:02:43.280> anyhow<00:02:44.280> that's<00:02:44.640> the<00:02:45.590> rigged<00:02:46.590> up

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:46.680 
the senses anyhow that's the rigged up

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:49.340 
the senses anyhow that's the rigged up
little<00:02:46.980> done<00:02:47.220> I<00:02:47.400> like<00:02:47.880> gadgets<00:02:48.120> so<00:02:48.720> you<00:02:49.260> know

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:49.350 
little done I like gadgets so you know

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:54.010 
little done I like gadgets so you know
probably<00:02:49.650> add<00:02:49.980> more<00:02:50.280> gadgets<00:02:50.910> to<00:02:51.060> this<00:02:51.210> bike

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:54.020 

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:56.570 

anyway<00:02:55.020> that's<00:02:55.290> pretty<00:02:55.740> much<00:02:56.100> the<00:02:56.280> finished

00:02:56.570 --> 00:02:56.580 
anyway that's pretty much the finished
