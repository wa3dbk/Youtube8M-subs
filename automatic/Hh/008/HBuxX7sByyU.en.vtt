00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:07.340 
to think about well what is it doing is
it<00:02:05.369> is<00:02:05.580> it<00:02:06.149> picking<00:02:06.330> up<00:02:06.570> nicely<00:02:06.810> as<00:02:07.229> the

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:09.450 
transition good because it really just

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:11.120 
transition good because it really just
did<00:02:09.750> its<00:02:09.929> job<00:02:09.989> and<00:02:10.229> I<00:02:10.440> didn't<00:02:10.679> think<00:02:10.800> too<00:02:11.009> much

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:11.130

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:40.820 

fuel<00:02:39.270> injection<00:02:39.660> is<00:02:39.780> a<00:02:39.810> huge<00:02:40.140> difference<00:02:40.440> in<00:02:40.770> a

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:40.830 
fuel injection is a huge difference in a

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:43.670 
fuel injection is a huge difference in a
huge<00:02:41.070> improvement<00:02:42.200> straightaway<00:02:43.200> that's<00:02:43.530> the

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:43.680 
huge improvement straightaway that's the

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:45.020 
huge improvement straightaway that's the
first<00:02:43.890> thing<00:02:43.950> I<00:02:44.070> noticed<00:02:44.340> was<00:02:44.520> I<00:02:44.760> can<00:02:44.910> just

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:45.030 
first thing I noticed was I can just

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:47.240 
first thing I noticed was I can just
push<00:02:45.360> the<00:02:45.510> button<00:02:45.540> start<00:02:46.230> the<00:02:46.350> bike<00:02:46.500> right

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:50.100 
away the fuel injection is nice i like

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:52.820 
away the fuel injection is nice i like
the<00:02:50.480> throttle<00:02:51.480> response<00:02:51.570> is<00:02:52.020> it<00:02:52.140> feels<00:02:52.620> a<00:02:52.710> lot

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:52.830 
the throttle response is it feels a lot

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:54.590 
the throttle response is it feels a lot
smoother<00:02:53.190> than<00:02:53.310> i<00:02:53.820> recall<00:02:54.240> from<00:02:54.450> the<00:02:54.510> previous

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:54.600 
smoother than i recall from the previous

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:57.560 
smoother than i recall from the previous
one<00:02:55.170> it's<00:02:56.130> also<00:02:56.310> nice<00:02:56.640> not<00:02:56.940> to<00:02:57.090> have<00:02:57.120> a<00:02:57.240> choke

00:02:57.560 --> 00:02:57.570 
one it's also nice not to have a choke

00:02:57.570 --> 00:02:59.090 
one it's also nice not to have a choke
you<00:02:57.840> know<00:02:57.930> just<00:02:58.110> fire<00:02:58.350> it<00:02:58.380> up<00:02:58.590> in<00:02:58.740> the<00:02:58.800> morning

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:00.950 
and walk away and fires right up

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:03.500 
and walk away and fires right up
dramatic<00:03:01.950> new<00:03:02.100> styling<00:03:02.550> the<00:03:02.700> ninja<00:03:02.970> 300

dramatic new styling the ninja 300

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:05.750 
dramatic new styling the ninja 300
solidifies<00:03:04.140> its<00:03:04.410> place<00:03:04.680> in<00:03:04.920> the<00:03:04.980> ninja<00:03:05.370> family

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:05.760 
solidifies its place in the ninja family

the<00:03:06.000> new<00:03:06.120> ninja<00:03:06.480> 300<00:03:07.050> is<00:03:07.200> definitely<00:03:07.940> has<00:03:08.940> more

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:09.270 
the new ninja 300 is definitely has more

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:11.750 
the new ninja 300 is definitely has more
aggressive<00:03:09.750> styling<00:03:09.990> that<00:03:10.320> I<00:03:10.350> think<00:03:10.680> fits<00:03:11.370> the

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:11.760 
aggressive styling that I think fits the

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:13.490 
aggressive styling that I think fits the
the<00:03:12.180> new<00:03:12.300> character<00:03:12.750> the<00:03:12.870> bike<00:03:13.050> which<00:03:13.230> is<00:03:13.380> just

00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:13.500 
the new character the bike which is just

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:14.840 
the new character the bike which is just
more<00:03:13.950> performance<00:03:14.489> all<00:03:14.610> the<00:03:14.670> way<00:03:14.760> around

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:14.850 
more performance all the way around

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:17.390 
more performance all the way around
probably<00:03:15.630> the<00:03:15.780> most<00:03:16.080> obvious<00:03:17.010> thing<00:03:17.160> is<00:03:17.280> when

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:17.400 
probably the most obvious thing is when

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:19.100 
probably the most obvious thing is when
you<00:03:17.459> first<00:03:17.700> walked<00:03:17.940> out<00:03:18.120> here<00:03:18.330> and<00:03:18.480> you<00:03:18.600> see

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:19.110 
you first walked out here and you see

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:22.760 
you first walked out here and you see

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:22.770 
the bike it no longer kind of a cute and

00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:25.310 
the bike it no longer kind of a cute and
cuddly<00:03:22.980> 250<00:03:23.850> it's<00:03:24.030> it's<00:03:24.330> got<00:03:24.570> the<00:03:24.750> very<00:03:24.989> sharp

cuddly 250 it's it's got the very sharp
angles<00:03:26.250> and<00:03:26.459> design<00:03:26.760> and<00:03:27.090> it<00:03:27.450> looks<00:03:27.630> like<00:03:27.870> a

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:27.900 
angles and design and it looks like a

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:30.170 
angles and design and it looks like a
grown-up<00:03:28.530> sport<00:03:28.920> bike<00:03:29.070> just<00:03:29.340> downscaled<00:03:30.120> a

bigger<00:03:32.400> and<00:03:32.670> it<00:03:32.790> just<00:03:33.030> has<00:03:33.300> more<00:03:33.720> of<00:03:33.840> a<00:03:33.930> feel<00:03:34.290> of

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:34.320 
bigger and it just has more of a feel of

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:37.490 
bigger and it just has more of a feel of
a<00:03:34.650> bigger<00:03:34.860> bike<00:03:35.160> and<00:03:35.780> again<00:03:36.780> the<00:03:36.959> performance
