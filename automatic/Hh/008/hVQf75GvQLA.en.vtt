let's go this way
there<00:04:29.910> you<00:04:30.060> go<00:04:30.270> that's<00:04:31.080> more<00:04:31.320> like<00:04:31.500> it

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:31.770 
there you go that's more like it

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:35.510 
there you go that's more like it
he<00:04:32.550> shoots<00:04:32.850> up<00:04:33.830> and<00:04:34.830> he<00:04:34.950> doesn't<00:04:35.100> know<00:04:35.370> he

00:04:35.510 --> 00:04:35.520 
he shoots up and he doesn't know he

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:37.880 
he shoots up and he doesn't know he
could<00:04:35.640> like<00:04:35.820> lean<00:04:36.390> over<00:04:36.570> and<00:04:36.930> this<00:04:37.620> shoots

00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:37.890 
could like lean over and this shoots

00:04:37.890 --> 00:04:41.659 
could like lean over and this shoots
from<00:04:38.010> behind<00:04:38.490> him<00:04:39.890> all<00:04:40.890> right<00:04:41.100> so<00:04:41.400> let's<00:04:41.550> take

00:04:41.659 --> 00:04:41.669 
from behind him all right so let's take

00:04:41.669 --> 00:04:47.180 
from behind him all right so let's take
that<00:04:41.760> out<00:04:41.820> in<00:04:42.210> a<00:04:42.540> little<00:04:43.340> gun<00:04:45.979> little<00:04:46.979> boot

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:47.190 
that out in a little gun little boot

00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:47.780 
that out in a little gun little boot
right<00:04:47.370> there

00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:47.790 
right there

00:04:47.790 --> 00:04:50.450 
right there
I<00:04:47.820> guess<00:04:48.090> this<00:04:48.300> came<00:04:48.720> to<00:04:48.930> took<00:04:49.110> it<00:04:49.229> off<00:04:49.320> of<00:04:49.590> his

00:04:50.450 --> 00:04:50.460 
I guess this came to took it off of his

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:53.300 
I guess this came to took it off of his
the<00:04:50.610> left<00:04:50.820> foot<00:04:51.500> like<00:04:52.500> this<00:04:52.530> shoes<00:04:52.979> man

00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:53.310 
the left foot like this shoes man

00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:55.040 
the left foot like this shoes man
thought<00:04:53.610> tore<00:04:53.910> up<00:04:54.120> he's<00:04:54.479> a<00:04:54.510> newt

00:04:55.040 --> 00:04:55.050 
thought tore up he's a newt

00:04:55.050 --> 00:04:58.360 
thought tore up he's a newt
he's<00:04:55.320> a<00:04:55.350> new<00:04:55.620> some<00:04:56.310> new<00:04:56.340> kicks

00:04:58.360 --> 00:04:58.370 
he's a new some new kicks

00:04:58.370 --> 00:05:01.219 
he's a new some new kicks
and<00:04:59.370> I<00:04:59.550> guess<00:04:59.759> he<00:04:59.969> can<00:05:00.090> hold<00:05:00.419> it<00:05:00.629> right<00:05:01.169> here

00:05:01.219 --> 00:05:01.229 
and I guess he can hold it right here

00:05:01.229 --> 00:05:05.800 
and I guess he can hold it right here
and<00:05:02.419> that<00:05:03.419> could<00:05:03.569> go<00:05:03.719> right<00:05:04.169> in<00:05:04.499> there

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:05.810 
and that could go right in there

00:05:05.810 --> 00:05:09.619 
and that could go right in there
this<00:05:06.810> trigger<00:05:07.169> finger<00:05:07.590> make<00:05:07.800> sure<00:05:07.979> I<00:05:08.360> do<00:05:09.360> this

00:05:09.619 --> 00:05:09.629 
this trigger finger make sure I do this

00:05:09.629 --> 00:05:13.149 
this trigger finger make sure I do this
correctly<00:05:09.870> don't<00:05:10.499> break<00:05:10.770> the<00:05:10.949> finger<00:05:12.110> yeah

00:05:13.149 --> 00:05:13.159 
correctly don't break the finger yeah

00:05:13.159 --> 00:05:18.830 
correctly don't break the finger yeah
there<00:05:14.159> we<00:05:14.310> go<00:05:15.590> all<00:05:16.590> right<00:05:16.650> and<00:05:17.279> I<00:05:17.629> guess<00:05:18.629> his

00:05:18.830 --> 00:05:18.840 
there we go all right and I guess his

00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:22.459 
there we go all right and I guess his
head<00:05:20.180> can't<00:05:21.180> pop<00:05:21.419> right<00:05:21.629> off<00:05:21.689> just<00:05:22.110> like<00:05:22.409> that

00:05:22.459 --> 00:05:22.469 
head can't pop right off just like that

00:05:22.469 --> 00:05:27.350 
head can't pop right off just like that
