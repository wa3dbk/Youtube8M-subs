00:00:01.100 --> 00:00:05.460
 Hello and welcome 

00:00:03.449 --> 00:00:09.200
 dear gaming friends my name sirius 

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:12.660
 and that she is 1 alluded to by dirt 3 

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:14.040
 a great feeling as soon as you go for the dirt 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:16.049
 the first one is waiting 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:17.970
 championship series on you or you 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:18.990
 starts the multiplayer mode and lets 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:23.490
 really crack it 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:25.890
 what do you mean what I mean, I mean that 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:28.289
 play in the steam summer sale for five euros 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:30.150
 bought there is currently on today 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:32.520
 Days for this cheap course but 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:35.160
 otherwise it is not too expensive 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:38.100
 Title more you really nice in the 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:39.870
 graphics settings can pop up 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:43.440
 It is already two years old 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:45.870
 and appeared in may 2011 there are 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:48.390
 different distances scenarios and 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:50.789
 race to test in dirt 3 and is 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:55.289
 of course a racing game that is too 

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:56.730
 First time rally friends addressed there 

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:57.000
 is a series that gave it a bit 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:59.160
 longer 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.289
 the special thing about dirt 3 is it 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:03.600
 actually that we are here this squad 

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:06.530
 I still have to bring it with me 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:08.549
 will not show in the video today 

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:10.979
 I have the game today today 

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:12.780
 I'm so pretentious for a two hour 

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:14.430
 drove a few races that is here 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:15.780
 the benchmark with the highest 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:17.610
 attitudes and then I have myself 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:19.200
 stop here multiplayer have 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:21.840
 I did not play but about a player 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:24.140
 you do not have to start a career but 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:27.000
 can just times such single races and 

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:28.920
 time trial just start now 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.509
 a little bit of a feeling for 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:31.860
 to get the game i got you this 

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:34.170
 whole a little bit cut together 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:36.090
 Just click on his 56 minutes video 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:37.829
 take a look at the game 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:39.060
 I offer that if that 

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:42.090
 maybe interested and who else 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:43.920
 after a cheap racing game from the 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:46.890
 home codemasters here for example 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:49.259
 currently have published with 2 searches 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:50.009
 he might find that just right there 

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:51.509
 right one 

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:54.270
 I think that's really good 

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:56.430
 has very nice scenarios with easy 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:58.290
 this year with these forests because you 

00:01:56.430 --> 00:02:00.899
 just different than the usual 

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:03.790
 Run away from these times 

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:06.229
 Standard racing tracks plays 

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:07.549
 maybe it's a bit unusual 

00:02:06.229 --> 00:02:10.580
 if you have never played something like this 

00:02:07.549 --> 00:02:13.580
 that you rally in these rows 

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:14.930
 stop completely alone against the 

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:17.900
 time that means you could do this here 

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:20.239
 quite nice to see that the cars always like that 

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:21.620
 with 10 20 seconds distance start the 

00:02:20.239 --> 00:02:22.310
 means when we are very very fast 

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:24.850
 on the way 

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:27.709
 which of course I was or not 

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:29.510
 then maybe we can get a full one 

00:02:27.709 --> 00:02:31.700
 seek man but it is not now so 

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:34.310
 that for example with this standard 

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:35.660
 rally rode ten people at the same time 

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:37.580
 go for it, we at with driver 

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:42.069
 It laments us all the time 

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:42.069
 where the next bend leads 

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:53.420
 what a little bit at the beginning 

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:55.280
 confusing is that the type decision 

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:56.900
 Lammert can do that afterwards as well 

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:58.940
 a little bit on the route 

00:02:56.900 --> 00:03:01.730
 really help and in real life 

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:03.110
 that is exactly the case that there is an announcer 

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:04.610
 next sitting, I do not know how the 

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:05.780
 in technical jargon if you call that 

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:07.730
 you know that you like the 

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:09.620
 video description post and maybe 

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:11.720
 It allows you to do that 

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:14.090
 once again such an overtaking maneuver 

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:16.489
 I can start playing the whole or 

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:18.099
 I generally play all the racing games very much 

00:03:16.489 --> 00:03:20.540
 very much from the cockpit perspective 

00:03:18.099 --> 00:03:24.819
 then belong to the five percent of 

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:27.110
 exotics that allegedly make so 

00:03:24.819 --> 00:03:29.870
 Grid 2 was still there so codemasters 

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:31.040
 the cockpit perspective have denied 

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:33.680
 because they said easy now 

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:35.840
 human only five percent of the racing game 

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:37.489
 players play so beautiful 

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:40.069
 Of course, that's also what you see here 

00:03:37.489 --> 00:03:41.629
 there are the well-known flashbacks the 

00:03:40.069 --> 00:03:44.690
 again with several chambers steps 

00:03:41.629 --> 00:03:46.760
 Therefore come cut and that will 

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:47.900
 really awesome out there can 

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:48.950
 Of course you just have a look 

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:51.980
 a little bit more of the game 

00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:54.139
 look at this mega monster jump 

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:56.420
 and that you have to worry about that 

00:03:54.139 --> 00:03:58.310
 one currently flies off the track in the 

00:03:56.420 --> 00:03:59.269
 the rest can really be the game 

00:03:58.310 --> 00:04:02.060
 be difficult, but there are 

00:03:59.269 --> 00:04:06.260
 fortunately also beginner modes the 

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:09.680
 you at all steering brake driving distances 

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:10.340
 track what do i help under the arms 

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:13.040
 to grab 

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:15.049
 So either the game can stop 

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:17.769
 be relatively easy and also 

00:04:15.049 --> 00:04:21.099
 get started and that's clear 

00:04:17.769 --> 00:04:24.320
 get started preparing fun 

00:04:21.099 --> 00:04:26.660
 Nonetheless, that's just as good 

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:30.440
 game for the absolute professionals because if 

00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:31.669
 you turn off all these aids 

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:33.650
 So you could just about this 

00:04:31.669 --> 00:04:35.479
 control beginner normal profi and such 

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:38.030
 continue and so on so standard settings 

00:04:35.479 --> 00:04:39.440
 then it gets very hakelig there 

00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:42.380
 you can already see how I am here with the 

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:45.020
 dare fighting ok now it is on sand in 

00:04:42.380 --> 00:04:46.880
 Kenya and alternating asphalt but so 

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:48.860
 if you help most of them 

00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:50.780
 turns off you do or I have 

00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:52.960
 Me, at least, I'm really upset 

00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:55.460
 believe there racing can look forward to 

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:59.210
 really happy about it and one 

00:04:55.460 --> 00:05:00.410
 Hard nut crack dust without end gave 

00:04:59.210 --> 00:05:01.580
 then eat it here and I have 

00:05:00.410 --> 00:05:02.330
 I think I'll let you a few 

00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:04.699
 pictures with profit 

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:08.780
 because it just looks totally awesome 

00:05:04.699 --> 00:05:10.039
 this one went cana mode one from ken 

00:05:08.780 --> 00:05:10.759
 Block actually knows that I have 

00:05:10.039 --> 00:05:13.520
 ever presented 

00:05:10.759 --> 00:05:14.690
 in the xbox 360 version so before two 

00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:16.460
 years if you are interested 

00:05:14.690 --> 00:05:18.889
 should i maybe do that to you 

00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:20.840
 just in a video of 

00:05:18.889 --> 00:05:22.039
 lincoln if you are not 

00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:23.840
 have played career 

00:05:22.039 --> 00:05:27.500
 not all cars start yet 

00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:30.410
 disposal but here the bmw one could 

00:05:27.500 --> 00:05:31.520
 already neatly occur well and 

00:05:30.410 --> 00:05:33.020
 I thought for a first 

00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:34.940
 Insight should that maybe 

00:05:33.020 --> 00:05:36.800
 It's a bit of a joke 

00:05:34.940 --> 00:05:39.349
 see game and as I said for 

00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:40.520
 today the thing for 499 is the last 

00:05:39.349 --> 00:05:43.490
 day about which I think me six euro 

00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:47.360
 49 if I'm not mistaken, that is 

00:05:43.490 --> 00:05:49.310
 pc version in qi shop so for 15 

00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:51.590
 perhaps to have 20 € otherwise 

00:05:49.310 --> 00:05:53.690
 So the thing is relatively cheap there 1 

00:05:51.590 --> 00:05:55.849
 5 out of there he does not get a doner dish 

00:05:53.690 --> 00:06:01.130
 for and you have a lot of fun with 

00:05:55.849 --> 00:06:03.380
 a proper race game yes and 

00:06:01.130 --> 00:06:04.820
 while the bmw over the asphalt 

00:06:03.380 --> 00:06:06.470
 Thunderous, I say goodbye 

00:06:04.820 --> 00:06:08.270
 again from my today's recommendation 

00:06:06.470 --> 00:06:08.870
 video I say is right, thanks for 

00:06:08.270 --> 00:06:13.240
 watch 

00:06:08.870 --> 00:06:13.240
 until next time and skin in
