stuck to what we were supposed to be

00:05:18.730 --> 00:05:20.640 
stuck to what we were supposed to be
doing<00:05:18.940> we<00:05:19.150> could<00:05:19.540> go<00:05:19.690> on<00:05:19.720> and<00:05:19.990> win<00:05:20.050> the<00:05:20.290> game<00:05:20.380> we

00:05:20.650 --> 00:05:23.310 
doing we could go on and win the game we
were<00:05:20.740> confident<00:05:21.100> that<00:05:21.310> we<00:05:21.669> could<00:05:21.790> do<00:05:21.940> that<00:05:22.320> but

00:05:23.310 --> 00:05:23.320 
were confident that we could do that but

00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:25.140 
were confident that we could do that but
it's<00:05:23.470> very<00:05:23.710> very<00:05:23.890> tough<00:05:24.130> to<00:05:24.700> expect<00:05:25.060> the

00:05:25.140 --> 00:05:25.150 
it's very very tough to expect the

00:05:25.150 --> 00:05:27.210 
it's very very tough to expect the
players<00:05:25.419> to<00:05:25.840> just<00:05:26.080> be<00:05:26.290> so<00:05:26.500> resilient<00:05:26.860> where

00:05:27.210 --> 00:05:27.220 
players to just be so resilient where

00:05:27.220 --> 00:05:29.280 
players to just be so resilient where
they<00:05:27.340> just<00:05:27.550> shake<00:05:27.730> off<00:05:28.000> things<00:05:28.270> like<00:05:28.480> that<00:05:28.630> but

00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:29.290 
they just shake off things like that but

00:05:29.290 --> 00:05:31.110 
they just shake off things like that but
they're<00:05:29.500> they're<00:05:29.650> expected<00:05:30.130> to<00:05:30.160> do<00:05:30.340> they're

00:05:31.110 --> 00:05:31.120 
they're they're expected to do they're

00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:33.540 
they're they're expected to do they're
expected<00:05:31.540> to<00:05:31.570> do<00:05:31.720> that<00:05:31.870> but<00:05:32.290> it's<00:05:32.440> tough<00:05:32.740> so

00:05:33.540 --> 00:05:33.550 
expected to do that but it's tough so

00:05:33.550 --> 00:05:36.270 
expected to do that but it's tough so
