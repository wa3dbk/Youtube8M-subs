next we will attach the pivot section

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:09.960 
next we will attach the pivot section
making<00:01:08.470> sure<00:01:08.800> that<00:01:08.980> the<00:01:09.130> Halfmoon<00:01:09.370> brake

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:09.970 
making sure that the Halfmoon brake

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:12.690 
making sure that the Halfmoon brake
plate<00:01:10.270> aligns<00:01:10.960> with<00:01:11.230> and<00:01:11.500> slides<00:01:12.040> into<00:01:12.310> the

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:15.190 
brake mechanism the pivot section is

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:16.920 
brake mechanism the pivot section is
designed<00:01:15.370> so<00:01:15.820> that<00:01:15.850> the<00:01:16.060> brake<00:01:16.270> plate<00:01:16.510> can<00:01:16.780> be

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:16.930 
designed so that the brake plate can be

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:19.170 
designed so that the brake plate can be
moved<00:01:17.170> forward<00:01:17.530> so<00:01:18.220> that<00:01:18.370> the<00:01:18.460> pivot<00:01:18.610> point<00:01:18.970> is

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:19.180 
moved forward so that the pivot point is

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:21.390 
moved forward so that the pivot point is
more<00:01:19.450> forward<00:01:19.750> this<00:01:20.650> will<00:01:20.830> reduce<00:01:21.010> the<00:01:21.220> amount

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:21.400 
more forward this will reduce the amount

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:23.609 
more forward this will reduce the amount
of<00:01:21.700> counterweight<00:01:22.180> required<00:01:22.600> and<00:01:22.869> is<00:01:23.380> also

00:01:23.609 --> 00:01:23.619 
of counterweight required and is also

00:01:23.619 --> 00:01:25.469 
of counterweight required and is also
the<00:01:23.800> method<00:01:24.220> for<00:01:24.369> using<00:01:24.580> the<00:01:24.850> crane<00:01:25.119> in<00:01:25.330> its

00:01:25.469 --> 00:01:25.479 
the method for using the crane in its

00:01:25.479 --> 00:01:28.290 
the method for using the crane in its
most<00:01:25.660> compact<00:01:26.170> mode<00:01:26.760> next<00:01:27.760> in<00:01:27.880> the<00:01:27.970> assembly
