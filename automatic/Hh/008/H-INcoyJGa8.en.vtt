00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
because M it could well and truly be

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:00.619 
because M it could well and truly be
actually<00:00:58.770> wrong<00:00:58.980> so<00:00:59.309> apart<00:01:00.030> from<00:01:00.120> that<00:01:00.239> let's

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:00.629 
actually wrong so apart from that let's

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:02.930 
actually wrong so apart from that let's
just<00:01:00.809> get<00:01:01.020> right<00:01:01.079> to<00:01:01.289> the<00:01:01.500> trailer<00:01:01.980> and<00:01:02.190> break

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.940 
just get right to the trailer and break

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:05.390 
just get right to the trailer and break
it<00:01:03.120> down<00:01:03.270> so<00:01:03.890> unfortunately<00:01:04.890> I<00:01:04.949> can<00:01:05.159> actually

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400 
it down so unfortunately I can actually

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:07.340 
it down so unfortunately I can actually
put<00:01:05.760> the<00:01:05.820> trailer<00:01:06.119> and<00:01:06.420> the<00:01:06.510> background<00:01:06.750> and

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
put the trailer and the background and

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:09.380 
put the trailer and the background and
the<00:01:07.409> reason<00:01:07.950> for<00:01:08.010> that<00:01:08.130> is<00:01:08.250> because<00:01:08.369> it's<00:01:08.820> IGN

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
the reason for that is because it's IGN

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:11.780 
the reason for that is because it's IGN
got<00:01:10.229> a<00:01:10.260> watermark<00:01:10.770> on<00:01:11.040> and<00:01:11.280> stuff<00:01:11.580> like<00:01:11.729> that

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
got a watermark on and stuff like that

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:14.149 
got a watermark on and stuff like that
and<00:01:12.000> I<00:01:12.240> just<00:01:12.659> I'm<00:01:12.900> not<00:01:12.930> allowed<00:01:13.290> to<00:01:13.530> use<00:01:13.560> it<00:01:13.979> I
