00:00:04.760 --> 00:00:04.770 
hey everyone just a quick little update

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:07.190 
hey everyone just a quick little update
I<00:00:05.279> wanted<00:00:05.730> to<00:00:05.819> show<00:00:06.029> two<00:00:06.569> things<00:00:06.600> and

00:00:07.190 --> 00:00:07.200 
I wanted to show two things and

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:10.070 
I wanted to show two things and
basically<00:00:07.589> it<00:00:07.649> helps<00:00:07.740> going<00:00:08.160> on<00:00:08.309> so<00:00:08.849> a<00:00:09.179> lot<00:00:09.960> of

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:10.080 
basically it helps going on so a lot of

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:12.770 
basically it helps going on so a lot of
you<00:00:10.230> saw<00:00:10.559> in<00:00:10.769> my<00:00:10.920> previous<00:00:10.950> video<00:00:11.759> be<00:00:11.940> my<00:00:12.480> older

00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:12.780 
you saw in my previous video be my older

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:14.990 
you saw in my previous video be my older
one<00:00:12.929> before<00:00:13.290> this<00:00:13.440> you<00:00:14.130> probably<00:00:14.549> saw<00:00:14.790> this

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:15.000 
one before this you probably saw this

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.500 
one before this you probably saw this
and<00:00:15.360> it's<00:00:16.320> not<00:00:16.529> completely<00:00:17.070> finished<00:00:17.330> as<00:00:18.330> far

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:18.510 
and it's not completely finished as far

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:20.630 
and it's not completely finished as far
as<00:00:18.600> planning<00:00:18.900> goes<00:00:19.320> but<00:00:20.100> you<00:00:20.189> can<00:00:20.340> see<00:00:20.490> I've

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:20.640 
as planning goes but you can see I've

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:22.490 
as planning goes but you can see I've
started<00:00:20.789> the<00:00:21.090> base<00:00:21.300> here<00:00:21.779> I'm<00:00:21.990> not<00:00:22.170> sure<00:00:22.380> if

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:22.500 
started the base here I'm not sure if

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:24.349 
started the base here I'm not sure if
you've<00:00:22.619> seen<00:00:22.920> my<00:00:23.310> older<00:00:23.609> videos<00:00:23.970> with<00:00:24.210> this

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:24.359 
you've seen my older videos with this

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:26.779 
you've seen my older videos with this

paper mini dual action hidden blade on
this<00:00:27.300> older<00:00:27.720> model<00:00:28.080> I<00:00:28.529> just<00:00:29.130> stacked<00:00:29.369> up<00:00:29.580> these

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:29.760 
this older model I just stacked up these

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:32.299 
this older model I just stacked up these
walls<00:00:30.000> normally<00:00:30.689> on<00:00:30.929> here<00:00:31.650> it's<00:00:31.920> so<00:00:32.160> much

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:32.309 
walls normally on here it's so much

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:35.990 
walls normally on here it's so much
longer<00:00:32.669> and<00:00:33.559> more<00:00:34.559> thin<00:00:35.010> than<00:00:35.430> the<00:00:35.460> original

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:36.000 
longer and more thin than the original

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.350 
longer and more thin than the original
wall<00:00:36.210> on<00:00:36.540> my<00:00:36.570> older<00:00:37.230> one<00:00:37.469> I<00:00:37.739> might<00:00:38.700> have<00:00:39.059> to<00:00:39.210> do

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.360 
wall on my older one I might have to do

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:41.060 
wall on my older one I might have to do
something<00:00:39.870> like<00:00:40.050> this<00:00:40.350> having<00:00:40.890> little

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.070 
something like this having little

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:43.610 
something like this having little
45-degree<00:00:42.000> angle<00:00:42.360> pieces<00:00:42.840> but<00:00:43.079> actually

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620 
45-degree angle pieces but actually

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:46.940 
45-degree angle pieces but actually
inside<00:00:44.160> of<00:00:44.399> it<00:00:44.520> itself<00:00:45.120> or<00:00:45.480> put<00:00:46.260> some<00:00:46.500> pins

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950 
inside of it itself or put some pins

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:49.400 
inside of it itself or put some pins
going<00:00:47.340> down<00:00:47.670> the<00:00:47.879> entire<00:00:48.149> thing<00:00:48.570> just<00:00:49.079> for

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
going down the entire thing just for

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:52.100 
going down the entire thing just for
added<00:00:50.000> stabilization<00:00:51.000> and<00:00:51.210> I<00:00:51.719> will<00:00:51.960> be

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.110 
added stabilization and I will be

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:54.380 
added stabilization and I will be
putting<00:00:52.320> updates<00:00:52.829> on<00:00:53.039> this<00:00:53.250> here<00:00:54.090> and<00:00:54.210> there<00:00:54.360> I

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390 
putting updates on this here and there I

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:56.540 
putting updates on this here and there I
am<00:00:54.660> working<00:00:54.930> on<00:00:55.140> the<00:00:55.260> tutorials<00:00:55.770> also<00:00:56.010> at<00:00:56.370> the

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
am working on the tutorials also at the

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:58.729 
am working on the tutorials also at the
same<00:00:56.730> time<00:00:56.789> it's<00:00:57.660> a<00:00:57.750> lot<00:00:57.899> easier<00:00:58.109> to<00:00:58.379> do<00:00:58.710> it

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
same time it's a lot easier to do it

00:00:58.739 --> 00:00:59.360 
same time it's a lot easier to do it
that<00:00:58.980> way

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370 
that way

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:04.039 
that way
as<00:00:59.430> for<00:00:59.940> the<00:01:00.109> m1911<00:01:01.109> I<00:01:01.320> worked<00:01:02.039> on<00:01:02.390> the<00:01:03.390> recoil

00:01:04.039 --> 00:01:04.049 
as for the m1911 I worked on the recoil

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:05.929 
as for the m1911 I worked on the recoil
spring<00:01:04.260> plug<00:01:04.470> I<00:01:05.159> guess<00:01:05.460> that's<00:01:05.670> what<00:01:05.820> it's

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:05.939 
spring plug I guess that's what it's

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:09.190 
spring plug I guess that's what it's
called<00:01:06.090> in<00:01:06.450> the<00:01:06.689> blueprint<00:01:07.229> here<00:01:08.130> it<00:01:08.280> is<00:01:08.400> it's

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:09.200 
called in the blueprint here it is it's

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:13.370 
called in the blueprint here it is it's
gotten<00:01:10.200> pretty<00:01:10.439> far<00:01:10.500> I<00:01:11.689> am<00:01:12.689> working<00:01:13.140> on<00:01:13.320> a

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
gotten pretty far I am working on a

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:15.710 
gotten pretty far I am working on a
cylinder<00:01:13.860> that<00:01:13.890> goes<00:01:14.159> over<00:01:14.610> this<00:01:14.760> it<00:01:15.180> needs<00:01:15.540> to

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
cylinder that goes over this it needs to

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:19.580 
cylinder that goes over this it needs to
be<00:01:15.900> this<00:01:16.590> entire<00:01:17.070> lower<00:01:17.939> length<00:01:18.840> from<00:01:19.200> here<00:01:19.439> to

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
be this entire lower length from here to

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:22.039 
be this entire lower length from here to
here<00:01:19.979> because<00:01:20.280> this<00:01:20.580> is<00:01:20.759> where<00:01:20.970> the<00:01:21.150> recoil

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049 
here because this is where the recoil

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:25.340 
here because this is where the recoil
spring<00:01:22.229> plug<00:01:22.680> goes<00:01:23.640> and<00:01:24.060> the<00:01:24.509> bushing<00:01:24.930> has<00:01:25.200> to

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
spring plug goes and the bushing has to

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:27.560 
spring plug goes and the bushing has to
lock<00:01:25.500> over<00:01:25.830> it<00:01:26.130> I've<00:01:26.640> actually<00:01:27.150> started

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570 
lock over it I've actually started

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:29.240 
lock over it I've actually started
working<00:01:27.900> on<00:01:28.110> the<00:01:28.259> barrel<00:01:28.590> this<00:01:28.829> is<00:01:28.950> actually

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
working on the barrel this is actually

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:30.999 
working on the barrel this is actually
the<00:01:29.369> inner<00:01:29.549> dimension<00:01:30.150> for<00:01:30.450> the<00:01:30.600> barrel

00:01:30.999 --> 00:01:31.009 
the inner dimension for the barrel

00:01:31.009 --> 00:01:35.569 
the inner dimension for the barrel
because<00:01:33.140> it<00:01:34.140> needs<00:01:34.439> to<00:01:34.560> wrap<00:01:34.740> around<00:01:34.770> it<00:01:35.369> and

00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:35.579 
because it needs to wrap around it and

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:37.730 
because it needs to wrap around it and
I'm<00:01:35.970> not<00:01:36.119> gonna<00:01:36.270> do<00:01:36.479> rifling<00:01:37.020> because<00:01:37.500> that's

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740 
I'm not gonna do rifling because that's

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:40.429 
I'm not gonna do rifling because that's
a<00:01:37.890> little<00:01:38.070> complicated<00:01:38.759> to<00:01:39.060> do<00:01:39.210> this<00:01:40.020> entire

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:40.439 
a little complicated to do this entire

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:43.460 
a little complicated to do this entire
gun<00:01:40.829> is<00:01:41.130> paper<00:01:41.670> so<00:01:42.180> I<00:01:42.420> don't<00:01:42.840> really<00:01:42.960> find<00:01:43.229> it

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:43.470 
gun is paper so I don't really find it

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:46.460 
gun is paper so I don't really find it
necessary<00:01:44.189> and<00:01:44.399> these<00:01:45.149> cylinders<00:01:45.509> I<00:01:45.960> made

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:46.470 
necessary and these cylinders I made

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:48.050 
necessary and these cylinders I made
that<00:01:46.829> I<00:01:46.890> mentioned<00:01:47.430> in<00:01:47.520> my<00:01:47.549> last<00:01:47.640> video

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060 
that I mentioned in my last video

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:50.149 
that I mentioned in my last video
they're<00:01:48.720> going<00:01:49.079> to<00:01:49.200> have<00:01:49.350> to<00:01:49.500> have<00:01:49.649> some<00:01:49.979> sort

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:50.159 
they're going to have to have some sort

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:52.880 
they're going to have to have some sort
of<00:01:50.280> little<00:01:50.460> cut<00:01:51.180> here<00:01:51.540> where<00:01:51.810> the<00:01:51.990> barrel<00:01:52.680> is

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:52.890 
of little cut here where the barrel is

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:55.190 
of little cut here where the barrel is
able<00:01:53.520> to<00:01:53.640> slide<00:01:53.880> through<00:01:54.180> the<00:01:54.270> front<00:01:54.600> and<00:01:54.899> if

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200 
able to slide through the front and if

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:57.319 
able to slide through the front and if
you've<00:01:55.320> seen<00:01:55.530> the<00:01:55.619> 1911<00:01:55.979> slide<00:01:56.460> I'm<00:01:56.790> sure<00:01:57.210> you

00:01:57.319 --> 00:01:57.329 
you've seen the 1911 slide I'm sure you

00:01:57.329 --> 00:01:58.550 
you've seen the 1911 slide I'm sure you
know<00:01:57.509> what<00:01:57.750> I'm<00:01:57.840> talking<00:01:58.170> about

00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:58.560 
know what I'm talking about

00:02:02.209 --> 00:02:02.219 
have a little bit longer to work on

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:04.219 
have a little bit longer to work on
these<00:02:02.340> things<00:02:02.399> a<00:02:02.880> little<00:02:03.000> bit<00:02:03.180> more<00:02:03.360> time<00:02:03.659> so

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:04.229 
these things a little bit more time so

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:06.590 
these things a little bit more time so

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:06.600 
hopefully I'll be able to possibly get

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:08.419 
hopefully I'll be able to possibly get
some<00:02:06.630> more<00:02:06.899> updates<00:02:07.110> going<00:02:07.680> on<00:02:07.799> my<00:02:08.009> friends<00:02:08.340> is

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:08.429 
some more updates going on my friends is

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:10.249 
some more updates going on my friends is
actually<00:02:08.789> building<00:02:09.149> one<00:02:09.270> of<00:02:09.300> these<00:02:09.509> too<00:02:09.840> but

00:02:10.249 --> 00:02:10.259 
actually building one of these too but

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:12.050 
actually building one of these too but
he's<00:02:10.410> doing<00:02:10.739> it<00:02:10.860> more<00:02:11.069> of<00:02:11.190> a<00:02:11.280> way<00:02:11.489> that

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:12.060 
he's doing it more of a way that

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:15.080 
he's doing it more of a way that
it's<00:02:12.510> not<00:02:12.750> supposed<00:02:13.230> to<00:02:13.350> function<00:02:13.980> and<00:02:14.220> yet

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:15.090 
it's not supposed to function and yet

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:17.059 
it's not supposed to function and yet
while<00:02:15.330> this<00:02:15.540> isn't<00:02:15.720> supposed<00:02:16.080> to<00:02:16.200> fire<00:02:16.440> real

00:02:17.059 --> 00:02:17.069 
while this isn't supposed to fire real

00:02:17.069 --> 00:02:19.100 
while this isn't supposed to fire real
rounds<00:02:17.610> or<00:02:17.700> anything<00:02:17.850> you<00:02:18.480> know<00:02:18.600> as<00:02:18.750> much<00:02:18.870> as<00:02:18.930> I

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:19.110 
rounds or anything you know as much as I

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:21.890 
rounds or anything you know as much as I
want<00:02:19.290> a<00:02:19.350> gun<00:02:19.530> to<00:02:19.740> blow<00:02:19.980> up<00:02:20.190> in<00:02:20.340> my<00:02:20.370> hand<00:02:20.819> and<00:02:21.120> you

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:21.900 
want a gun to blow up in my hand and you

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:23.180 
want a gun to blow up in my hand and you
know<00:02:21.959> I'm<00:02:22.200> not<00:02:22.230> a<00:02:22.380> big<00:02:22.590> fan<00:02:22.740> of<00:02:22.800> third-degree

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:23.190 
know I'm not a big fan of third-degree

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:25.640 
know I'm not a big fan of third-degree
burns<00:02:23.610> but<00:02:24.480> I'll<00:02:24.660> put<00:02:24.810> a<00:02:24.870> link<00:02:25.080> to<00:02:25.170> his<00:02:25.620> channel

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:25.650 
burns but I'll put a link to his channel

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:27.800 
burns but I'll put a link to his channel
in<00:02:26.190> the<00:02:26.220> description<00:02:26.670> he's<00:02:27.569> actually

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:27.810 
in the description he's actually

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:30.320 
in the description he's actually
building<00:02:28.319> everything<00:02:28.560> out<00:02:28.860> of<00:02:28.890> card<00:02:29.400> stock<00:02:29.459> so

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:30.330 
building everything out of card stock so

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:32.870 
building everything out of card stock so
it<00:02:30.540> will<00:02:30.690> be<00:02:30.870> it<00:02:31.620> will<00:02:31.680> layer<00:02:32.010> up<00:02:32.280> faster

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:32.880 
it will be it will layer up faster

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:34.570 
it will be it will layer up faster
because<00:02:33.300> this<00:02:33.690> is<00:02:33.840> pretty<00:02:34.080> time-consuming

00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:34.580 
because this is pretty time-consuming

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:37.520 
because this is pretty time-consuming
especially<00:02:35.580> since<00:02:36.209> he's<00:02:36.420> stacking<00:02:36.810> it<00:02:37.140> all<00:02:37.290> up

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:37.530 
especially since he's stacking it all up

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:39.800 
especially since he's stacking it all up
this<00:02:37.739> direction<00:02:38.040> which<00:02:38.610> probably<00:02:39.120> means<00:02:39.540> he's

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:39.810 
this direction which probably means he's

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:41.390 
this direction which probably means he's
just<00:02:40.050> going<00:02:40.260> to<00:02:40.350> be<00:02:40.440> rounding<00:02:40.950> everything

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:41.400 
just going to be rounding everything

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:43.550 
just going to be rounding everything
later<00:02:41.790> but<00:02:42.450> I'm<00:02:42.540> not<00:02:42.690> entirely<00:02:42.989> sure<00:02:43.380> you're

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:45.690 
gonna have to ask him yourself so thanks
