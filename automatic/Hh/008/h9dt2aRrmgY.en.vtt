to<00:03:19.019> get<00:03:19.109> to<00:03:19.199> this<00:03:19.290> story<00:03:19.560> today<00:03:19.680> I<00:03:19.799> was<00:03:20.160> quite

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:20.340 
to get to this story today I was quite

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:22.430 
to get to this story today I was quite
taken<00:03:20.489> with<00:03:20.669> it<00:03:20.879> it<00:03:21.359> is<00:03:21.540> of<00:03:21.750> course<00:03:21.780> space

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:22.440 
taken with it it is of course space

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:24.860 
taken with it it is of course space
whale<00:03:22.919> watching<00:03:23.250> using<00:03:24.209> digital<00:03:24.449> globes

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:24.870 
whale watching using digital globes

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:26.900 
whale watching using digital globes
world<00:03:25.379> view<00:03:25.620> to<00:03:25.799> platform<00:03:26.310> scientists<00:03:26.849> are

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:26.910 
world view to platform scientists are

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:28.970 
world view to platform scientists are
able<00:03:26.940> to<00:03:27.359> actually<00:03:27.540> track<00:03:28.079> well<00:03:28.470> movements

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:28.980 
able to actually track well movements

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:31.399 
able to actually track well movements
from<00:03:29.400> space<00:03:29.849> it's<00:03:30.389> not<00:03:30.720> just<00:03:31.139> that<00:03:31.230> they're

00:03:31.399 --> 00:03:31.409 
from space it's not just that they're

00:03:31.409 --> 00:03:32.599 
from space it's not just that they're
tracking<00:03:31.769> them<00:03:32.069> is<00:03:32.159> that<00:03:32.280> they<00:03:32.430> have<00:03:32.519> an

00:03:32.599 --> 00:03:32.609 
tracking them is that they have an

00:03:32.609 --> 00:03:34.449 
tracking them is that they have an
algorithm<00:03:32.940> which<00:03:33.329> can<00:03:33.540> automatically

00:03:34.449 --> 00:03:34.459 
algorithm which can automatically

00:03:34.459 --> 00:03:36.949 
algorithm which can automatically
identify<00:03:35.459> the<00:03:35.519> whales<00:03:35.940> so<00:03:36.659> that

00:03:36.949 --> 00:03:36.959 
identify the whales so that

00:03:36.959 --> 00:03:38.860 
identify the whales so that
oceanographers<00:03:37.859> don't<00:03:38.099> have<00:03:38.250> to<00:03:38.400> pour<00:03:38.730> over

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:38.870 
oceanographers don't have to pour over

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:41.569 
oceanographers don't have to pour over
these<00:03:39.870> satellite<00:03:40.409> images<00:03:40.859> and<00:03:40.889> try<00:03:41.220> to<00:03:41.280> say<00:03:41.459> is

00:03:41.569 --> 00:03:41.579 
these satellite images and try to say is

00:03:41.579 --> 00:03:43.670 
these satellite images and try to say is
that<00:03:41.609> a<00:03:41.760> whale<00:03:41.970> or<00:03:42.000> is<00:03:42.299> it<00:03:42.419> a<00:03:42.449> wave<00:03:42.659> yeah<00:03:43.349> it's<00:03:43.590> a

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:43.680 
that a whale or is it a wave yeah it's a

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:45.920 
that a whale or is it a wave yeah it's a
great<00:03:43.859> technology<00:03:44.669> it's<00:03:45.150> got<00:03:45.329> I<00:03:45.479> mean<00:03:45.510> in<00:03:45.750> just

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:45.930 
great technology it's got I mean in just

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:47.420 
great technology it's got I mean in just
the<00:03:46.049> ability<00:03:46.169> to<00:03:46.470> do<00:03:46.620> and<00:03:46.799> track<00:03:47.040> these<00:03:47.190> things

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:47.430 
the ability to do and track these things

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:48.500 
the ability to do and track these things
from<00:03:47.579> space<00:03:47.819> and<00:03:47.849> to<00:03:48.090> develop<00:03:48.239> this

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:48.510 
from space and to develop this

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:50.000 
from space and to develop this
technology<00:03:48.569> the<00:03:49.349> thing<00:03:49.530> that<00:03:49.650> you<00:03:49.739> pointed

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:50.010 
technology the thing that you pointed

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:50.930 
technology the thing that you pointed
out<00:03:50.129> that<00:03:50.280> in<00:03:50.400> one<00:03:50.519> of<00:03:50.549> these<00:03:50.669> stories

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:50.940 
out that in one of these stories

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:52.129 
out that in one of these stories
actually<00:03:51.090> said<00:03:51.389> that<00:03:51.419> many<00:03:51.690> scientists<00:03:52.049> have

00:03:52.129 --> 00:03:52.139 
actually said that many scientists have

00:03:52.139 --> 00:03:53.780 
actually said that many scientists have
actually<00:03:52.199> lost<00:03:52.500> their<00:03:52.799> lives<00:03:52.979> trying<00:03:53.340> to

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:53.790 
actually lost their lives trying to

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:55.550 
actually lost their lives trying to
track<00:03:54.090> well<00:03:54.299> movements<00:03:54.810> from<00:03:54.989> small<00:03:55.260> planes

00:03:55.550 --> 00:03:55.560 
track well movements from small planes

00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:57.259 
track well movements from small planes
and<00:03:55.769> so<00:03:55.859> forth<00:03:56.129> so<00:03:56.579> this<00:03:56.760> solves<00:03:57.120> that<00:03:57.209> problem

00:03:57.259 --> 00:03:57.269 
and so forth so this solves that problem

00:03:57.269 --> 00:03:59.509 
and so forth so this solves that problem
which<00:03:57.780> is<00:03:57.810> kind<00:03:58.409> of<00:03:58.500> an<00:03:58.590> important<00:03:58.919> one<00:03:59.040> no<00:03:59.370> I'm

00:03:59.509 --> 00:03:59.519 
which is kind of an important one no I'm

00:03:59.519 --> 00:04:01.039 
which is kind of an important one no I'm
just<00:03:59.760> wondering<00:03:59.970> when<00:04:00.299> William<00:04:00.599> Shatner<00:04:00.989> and

00:04:01.039 --> 00:04:01.049 
just wondering when William Shatner and

00:04:01.049 --> 00:04:02.390 
just wondering when William Shatner and
Leonard<00:04:01.319> Nimoy<00:04:01.560> or<00:04:01.739> going<00:04:01.949> to<00:04:02.010> weigh<00:04:02.129> in<00:04:02.310> on

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:02.400 
Leonard Nimoy or going to weigh in on

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:03.830 
Leonard Nimoy or going to weigh in on
this<00:04:02.579> this<00:04:02.849> is<00:04:02.970> a<00:04:03.000> really<00:04:03.209> good<00:04:03.329> point<00:04:03.479> is<00:04:03.720> this

00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:03.840 
this this is a really good point is this

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:06.170 
this this is a really good point is this

trying to find find whales to talk to
Vijay<00:04:10.560> I<00:04:10.590> believe<00:04:10.919> no<00:04:11.250> that<00:04:11.849> was<00:04:12.000> Star<00:04:12.180> Trek<00:04:12.329> oh

00:04:12.589 --> 00:04:12.599

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:29.850 
first year is a long ramping up period
and<00:04:28.480> we've<00:04:28.600> only<00:04:28.690> just<00:04:28.870> started<00:04:29.230> the<00:04:29.650> first

coming<00:04:32.590> in<00:04:32.680> March<00:04:32.890> but<00:04:33.280> beyond<00:04:33.700> that<00:04:33.850> we're

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:34.510 
coming in March but beyond that we're

gonna have to wait for some
announcements<00:04:35.800> at<00:04:35.890> e3<00:04:36.040> in<00:04:36.460> June<00:04:36.760> and<00:04:37.210> we're

announcements at e3 in June and we're

00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:38.790 
announcements at e3 in June and we're
probably<00:04:37.930> only<00:04:38.140> going<00:04:38.320> to<00:04:38.410> see<00:04:38.530> the<00:04:38.650> real

00:04:38.790 --> 00:04:38.800 
probably only going to see the real

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:40.620 
probably only going to see the real
flourishing<00:04:39.760> of<00:04:39.910> games<00:04:40.120> for<00:04:40.360> the<00:04:40.450> platform

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:40.630 
flourishing of games for the platform

flourishing of games for the platform
this<00:04:41.260> holiday<00:04:41.680> season<00:04:41.710> yeah<00:04:42.520> that<00:04:42.820> was<00:04:42.940> the

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:42.970 
this holiday season yeah that was the

00:04:42.970 --> 00:04:44.610 
this holiday season yeah that was the
thing<00:04:43.120> the<00:04:43.270> hardware<00:04:43.630> was<00:04:43.990> they<00:04:44.170> just<00:04:44.200> barely
