first<00:00:16.470> to<00:00:16.619> thinking<00:00:17.070> about<00:00:17.220> the<00:00:17.430> car<00:00:17.640> I<00:00:17.670> need

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:18.000 
first to thinking about the car I need

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.830 
first to thinking about the car I need
to<00:00:18.119> try<00:00:18.509> the<00:00:18.570> bike<00:00:18.840> so<00:00:19.230> I<00:00:19.680> go<00:00:19.920> in<00:00:20.670> Spain<00:00:21.180> at<00:00:21.360> coma

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:02.580 
learning and after we see what is

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:06.350 
learning and after we see what is
possible<00:02:02.790> to<00:02:03.180> do<00:02:03.710> it's<00:02:04.710> amazing<00:02:05.520> race<00:02:05.939> i<00:02:05.970> was

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:06.360 
possible to do it's amazing race i was

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:08.509 
possible to do it's amazing race i was
looking<00:02:06.810> that<00:02:06.990> about<00:02:07.320> when<00:02:07.590> i<00:02:07.619> was<00:02:07.860> younger<00:02:08.129> i

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:08.519 
looking that about when i was younger i

00:02:08.519 --> 00:02:13.009 
looking that about when i was younger i
also<00:02:09.950> it's<00:02:10.950> the<00:02:11.489> most<00:02:11.730> dangerous<00:02:12.360> race<00:02:12.659> on<00:02:12.900> the

00:02:13.009 --> 00:02:13.019 
also it's the most dangerous race on the

00:02:13.019 --> 00:02:16.660 
also it's the most dangerous race on the
world<00:02:13.200> I<00:02:13.560> see<00:02:13.860> a<00:02:13.890> lot<00:02:14.010> of<00:02:14.689> rider

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:16.670 
world I see a lot of rider

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:20.290 
world I see a lot of rider
play<00:02:17.450> with<00:02:17.630> the<00:02:17.720> life<00:02:17.900> there<00:02:18.140> so<00:02:18.349> I<00:02:19.120> mean<00:02:20.120> it's

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:20.300 
play with the life there so I mean it's

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:24.160 
play with the life there so I mean it's
not<00:02:21.489> easy<00:02:22.489> to<00:02:22.849> learn<00:02:23.000> quick<00:02:23.360> and<00:02:23.630> to<00:02:23.810> go<00:02:23.930> fast

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:24.170 
not easy to learn quick and to go fast

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:26.080 
not easy to learn quick and to go fast
at<00:02:24.410> the<00:02:24.440> moment<00:02:24.800> I<00:02:24.920> want<00:02:25.069> to<00:02:25.280> stay<00:02:25.459> focused<00:02:25.700> in

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:26.090 
at the moment I want to stay focused in

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:30.580 
at the moment I want to stay focused in
my<00:02:26.300> learning<00:02:27.260> and<00:02:27.500> in<00:02:28.340> navigation<00:02:29.440> you<00:02:30.440> know<00:02:30.560> I

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:30.590 
my learning and in navigation you know I

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:35.820 
my learning and in navigation you know I
think<00:02:30.860> also<00:02:31.220> that<00:02:31.390> kind<00:02:32.390> of<00:02:32.650> things<00:02:33.650> you<00:02:34.300> learn

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:35.830 
think also that kind of things you learn

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:38.500 
think also that kind of things you learn
it's<00:02:36.830> not<00:02:36.980> easy<00:02:37.280> to<00:02:37.640> learn<00:02:37.790> i<00:02:37.850> mean<00:02:38.180> the

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:38.510 
it's not easy to learn i mean the

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:40.570 
it's not easy to learn i mean the
experience<00:02:39.050> of<00:02:39.200> potential<00:02:39.860> was<00:02:40.040> amazing<00:02:40.459> on

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:40.580 
experience of potential was amazing on

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:43.870 
experience of potential was amazing on
the<00:02:40.700> past<00:02:40.910> and<00:02:41.209> also<00:02:41.900> the<00:02:42.050> for<00:02:42.980> mark<00:02:43.220> mark<00:02:43.700> have

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:43.880 
the past and also the for mark mark have

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:47.350 
the past and also the for mark mark have
smart<00:02:44.420> head<00:02:44.690> and<00:02:44.989> a<00:02:45.290> lot<00:02:45.500> of<00:02:45.530> experience<00:02:46.130> so<00:02:47.060> we

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:47.360 
smart head and a lot of experience so we

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:51.250 
smart head and a lot of experience so we
need<00:02:47.510> to<00:02:47.630> learn<00:02:47.750> that<00:02:47.989> more<00:02:48.470> to<00:02:48.709> go<00:02:48.830> fast<00:02:49.930> the<00:02:50.930> i

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:51.260 
need to learn that more to go fast the i

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:52.840 
need to learn that more to go fast the i
think<00:02:51.530> the<00:02:51.620> most<00:02:51.830> difficult<00:02:52.010> things<00:02:52.489> for<00:02:52.580> me

not sleeping on the bike will be

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:08.140 
not sleeping on the bike will be
difficult<00:03:05.590> and<00:03:06.590> after<00:03:07.130> the<00:03:07.549> long<00:03:07.700> race<00:03:07.940> you

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:08.150 
difficult and after the long race you

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:10.690 
difficult and after the long race you
know<00:03:08.269> it's<00:03:08.420> two<00:03:08.660> weeks<00:03:08.780> race<00:03:09.310> with<00:03:10.310> a<00:03:10.340> lot<00:03:10.670> of
