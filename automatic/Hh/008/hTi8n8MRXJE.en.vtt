hello<00:00:00.420> I've<00:00:00.930> stuck<00:00:01.350> a<00:00:01.380> solid<00:00:02.010> state<00:00:02.190> drive<00:00:02.490> now

00:00:02.780 --> 00:00:02.790 
hello I've stuck a solid state drive now

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:13.810 
hello I've stuck a solid state drive now
I'm<00:00:02.939> IPS<00:00:03.449> free<00:00:04.130> stuck<00:00:05.130> in<00:00:05.250> a<00:00:05.629> 240<00:00:06.629> gig<00:00:06.870> but<00:00:09.530> and

00:00:13.810 --> 00:00:13.820 

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:19.609 

I've<00:00:14.820> noticed<00:00:15.179> big<00:00:15.529> reduction<00:00:16.529> in<00:00:16.710> heat<00:00:18.619> on

00:00:19.609 --> 00:00:19.619 
I've noticed big reduction in heat on

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:23.150 
I've noticed big reduction in heat on
the<00:00:19.770> power<00:00:19.980> supply<00:00:20.189> run<00:00:21.000> a<00:00:21.029> lot<00:00:21.330> cooler<00:00:21.630> and<00:00:22.160> so

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:23.160 
the power supply run a lot cooler and so

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:25.310 
the power supply run a lot cooler and so
I<00:00:23.189> was<00:00:23.279> the<00:00:23.430> other<00:00:23.580> console<00:00:24.210> so<00:00:24.630> there's<00:00:25.170> no

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:25.320 
I was the other console so there's no

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:27.859 
I was the other console so there's no
longer<00:00:25.680> he<00:00:26.369> getting<00:00:26.789> passed<00:00:27.060> on<00:00:27.359> from<00:00:27.630> the

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:27.869 
longer he getting passed on from the

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:30.470 
longer he getting passed on from the
hard<00:00:28.170> drive<00:00:28.400> to<00:00:29.400> the<00:00:29.670> power<00:00:29.880> supply<00:00:30.060> it's<00:00:30.330> the

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:30.480 
hard drive to the power supply it's the

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:32.540 
hard drive to the power supply it's the
rest<00:00:30.660> of<00:00:30.779> the<00:00:30.840> thing<00:00:30.990> says<00:00:31.230> create<00:00:31.859> some<00:00:32.219> a

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:32.550 
rest of the thing says create some a

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:38.810 
rest of the thing says create some a
huge<00:00:35.360> yeah<00:00:36.800> it's<00:00:37.800> passed<00:00:38.040> on<00:00:38.250> heat<00:00:38.550> and<00:00:38.760> then

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:38.820 
huge yeah it's passed on heat and then

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:42.350 
huge yeah it's passed on heat and then
causing<00:00:39.540> a<00:00:39.989> large<00:00:40.379> amount<00:00:40.739> heat<00:00:40.980> to<00:00:41.579> then<00:00:42.120> it

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:42.360 
causing a large amount heat to then it

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:46.360 
causing a large amount heat to then it
come<00:00:42.660> out<00:00:42.750> on<00:00:42.809> the<00:00:43.260> console<00:00:44.059> so<00:00:45.059> let's<00:00:45.450> now

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:46.370 
come out on the console so let's now

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:48.650 
come out on the console so let's now
people<00:00:47.370> say<00:00:47.489> that<00:00:47.670> there<00:00:48.059> they<00:00:48.300> don't<00:00:48.480> make<00:00:48.600> a

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660 
people say that there they don't make a

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:52.240 
people say that there they don't make a
big<00:00:49.050> difference<00:00:49.350> but<00:00:50.449> reduction<00:00:51.449> in<00:00:51.600> heat<00:00:51.840> of

00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:52.250 
big difference but reduction in heat of

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:55.600 
big difference but reduction in heat of
about<00:00:53.250> twenty<00:00:53.640> percent<00:00:53.670> is<00:00:54.210> not<00:00:54.360> bad

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:55.610 
about twenty percent is not bad

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:58.880 
about twenty percent is not bad
considering<00:00:56.750> so<00:00:57.750> the<00:00:57.989> console<00:00:58.379> is<00:00:58.469> no<00:00:58.620> longer

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
considering so the console is no longer

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:01.580 
considering so the console is no longer
blowing<00:00:59.670> really<00:01:00.480> hot<00:01:00.719> air<00:01:00.899> it's<00:01:01.199> just<00:01:01.410> blowing

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590 
blowing really hot air it's just blowing

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:05.329 
blowing really hot air it's just blowing
I<00:01:03.110> would<00:01:04.110> say<00:01:04.229> warm<00:01:04.500> air<00:01:04.739> but<00:01:05.159> it<00:01:05.250> obviously

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
I would say warm air but it obviously

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:07.780 
I would say warm air but it obviously
it's<00:01:05.700> not<00:01:05.729> going<00:01:05.939> to<00:01:06.030> be<00:01:06.119> as<00:01:06.390> good<00:01:06.720> as<00:01:06.869> the

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:07.790 
it's not going to be as good as the

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:12.850 
it's not going to be as good as the
later<00:01:08.790> PS<00:01:09.270> freeze<00:01:10.159> because<00:01:11.159> they<00:01:11.280> had<00:01:11.640> a

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:12.860 
later PS freeze because they had a

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:21.590 
later PS freeze because they had a
smaller<00:01:14.630> CPU<00:01:15.770> so<00:01:16.770> and<00:01:18.140> to<00:01:19.140> be<00:01:19.229> honest<00:01:20.600> I'm

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600 
smaller CPU so and to be honest I'm

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:24.469 
smaller CPU so and to be honest I'm
sticking<00:01:21.990> with<00:01:22.049> the<00:01:22.229> 60<00:01:22.560> gig<00:01:22.770> kids<00:01:23.090> well<00:01:24.090> it's

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
sticking with the 60 gig kids well it's

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:28.039 
sticking with the 60 gig kids well it's
now<00:01:24.630> 240<00:01:25.560> X<00:01:25.830> for<00:01:26.189> the<00:01:26.790> actual<00:01:27.119> original<00:01:27.600> launch

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:28.049 
now 240 X for the actual original launch

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:32.539 
now 240 X for the actual original launch
model<00:01:30.320> so<00:01:31.320> because<00:01:31.590> I<00:01:31.650> like<00:01:31.890> the<00:01:31.920> shiny<00:01:32.280> finish

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549 
model so because I like the shiny finish

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:34.310 
model so because I like the shiny finish
in<00:01:32.820> the<00:01:32.850> chrome<00:01:33.119> finish<00:01:33.479> as<00:01:33.630> well<00:01:33.689> as<00:01:33.960> the

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320 
in the chrome finish as well as the

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:36.560 
in the chrome finish as well as the
ricard<00:01:35.189> reader<00:01:35.430> as<00:01:35.820> I<00:01:35.939> did<00:01:36.150> in<00:01:36.270> my<00:01:36.299> previous

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
ricard reader as I did in my previous

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:43.639 
ricard reader as I did in my previous
video<00:01:37.340> and<00:01:38.340> the<00:01:38.460> four<00:01:38.670> USB<00:01:38.939> ports<00:01:42.170> yeah<00:01:43.170> and

00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:43.649 
video and the four USB ports yeah and

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:47.480 
video and the four USB ports yeah and
the<00:01:44.399> newer<00:01:44.640> models<00:01:45.060> they<00:01:45.450> took<00:01:46.040> more<00:01:47.040> parts

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:47.490 
the newer models they took more parts

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:48.950 
the newer models they took more parts
out<00:01:47.640> of<00:01:47.670> it<00:01:47.909> that<00:01:47.939> they<00:01:48.210> actually<00:01:48.299> added<00:01:48.600> they

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:48.960 
out of it that they actually added they

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:52.609 
out of it that they actually added they
didn't<00:01:49.200> add<00:01:49.320> anything<00:01:49.619> to<00:01:49.860> it<00:01:50.630> the<00:01:51.630> wires<00:01:51.930> is

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:52.619 
didn't add anything to it the wires is

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:58.520 
didn't add anything to it the wires is
not<00:01:52.979> an<00:01:53.880> egg<00:01:54.600> on<00:01:54.899> the<00:01:56.450> latest<00:01:57.450> model<00:01:57.960> they

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:58.530 
not an egg on the latest model they

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:01.069 
not an egg on the latest model they
still<00:01:58.860> stuck<00:01:59.100> with<00:01:59.280> the<00:01:59.369> G<00:01:59.579> and<00:01:59.820> I<00:02:00.780> don't<00:02:00.960> know

00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:01.079 
still stuck with the G and I don't know

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:03.050 
still stuck with the G and I don't know
why<00:02:01.229> they<00:02:01.380> did<00:02:01.590> that<00:02:01.619> Sony<00:02:02.070> because<00:02:02.670> I<00:02:02.909> would

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:03.060 
why they did that Sony because I would

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:04.700 
why they did that Sony because I would
have<00:02:03.149> fought<00:02:03.299> like<00:02:03.450> which<00:02:03.689> found<00:02:04.049> a<00:02:04.290> way<00:02:04.560> of

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:04.710 
have fought like which found a way of

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:07.310 
have fought like which found a way of
improving<00:02:04.860> the<00:02:05.729> performance<00:02:05.850> of<00:02:06.420> the<00:02:06.780> console

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:07.320 
improving the performance of the console

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:11.640 
improving the performance of the console
okay<00:02:07.759> people<00:02:08.759> don't<00:02:08.879> have

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:11.650 

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:14.500 

Oh<00:02:12.910> majority<00:02:13.910> of<00:02:13.940> people<00:02:14.180> have<00:02:14.300> eight

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:14.510 
Oh majority of people have eight

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:18.340 
Oh majority of people have eight
megabytes<00:02:16.030> download<00:02:17.030> speed<00:02:17.390> but<00:02:17.750> I<00:02:17.780> mean<00:02:18.110> I've

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:18.350 
megabytes download speed but I mean I've

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:22.690 
megabytes download speed but I mean I've
got<00:02:18.620> 100-plus<00:02:19.900> and<00:02:21.190> fish<00:02:22.190> four<00:02:22.430> megabytes

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:22.700 
got 100-plus and fish four megabytes

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:24.850 
got 100-plus and fish four megabytes
kind<00:02:23.300> of<00:02:23.360> lets<00:02:23.510> it<00:02:23.630> down<00:02:23.750> but<00:02:24.050> even<00:02:24.620> if<00:02:24.740> you

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:24.860 
kind of lets it down but even if you

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:29.220 
kind of lets it down but even if you
haven't<00:02:25.160> got<00:02:25.310> that<00:02:25.550> kind<00:02:25.820> of<00:02:26.120> firm<00:02:26.630> in<00:02:27.080> a<00:02:27.140> nap

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:29.230 
haven't got that kind of firm in a nap

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:33.010 
haven't got that kind of firm in a nap
well<00:02:30.230> I'm<00:02:30.410> gonna<00:02:31.420> wire<00:02:32.420> it<00:02:32.450> but<00:02:32.900> unfortunately

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:33.020 
well I'm gonna wire it but unfortunately

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:36.460 
well I'm gonna wire it but unfortunately
because<00:02:33.740> I'm<00:02:33.830> like<00:02:33.980> on<00:02:34.160> the<00:02:34.250> third<00:02:34.490> floor<00:02:35.470> it's

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:36.470 
because I'm like on the third floor it's

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:38.200 
because I'm like on the third floor it's
obviously<00:02:37.040> going<00:02:37.190> to<00:02:37.280> take<00:02:37.370> a<00:02:37.400> time<00:02:37.760> to<00:02:38.060> get

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:38.210 
obviously going to take a time to get

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:40.180 
obviously going to take a time to get
cable<00:02:38.660> running<00:02:39.410> up<00:02:39.590> because<00:02:39.860> I<00:02:39.890> gotta<00:02:40.040> run

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:40.190 
cable running up because I gotta run
