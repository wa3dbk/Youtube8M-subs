called Elio motors and as I matured I

00:01:13.289 --> 00:01:14.449 
called Elio motors and as I matured I
realized<00:01:13.619> that<00:01:13.679> is<00:01:13.859> about<00:01:13.979> as<00:01:14.039> likely<00:01:14.249> as

00:01:14.449 --> 00:01:14.459 
realized that is about as likely as

00:01:14.459 --> 00:01:19.010
