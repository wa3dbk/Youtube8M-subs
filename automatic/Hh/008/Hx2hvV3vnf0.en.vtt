are trying to be cute adapted and for

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:11.330 
are trying to be cute adapted and for
you<00:03:09.300> other<00:03:09.510> paleo<00:03:09.959> types<00:03:10.290> and<00:03:10.590> go<00:03:10.739> for<00:03:11.070> it

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:11.340 
you other paleo types and go for it

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:14.090 
you other paleo types and go for it
because<00:03:11.790> the<00:03:12.480> point<00:03:12.810> is<00:03:12.870> these<00:03:13.140> plot<00:03:13.830> these

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:14.100 
because the point is these plot these

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:16.509 
because the point is these plot these
these<00:03:14.580> are<00:03:14.760> this<00:03:14.970> is<00:03:15.030> like<00:03:15.180> the<00:03:15.450> golden

00:03:16.509 --> 00:03:16.519 
these are this is like the golden

Fountain<00:03:17.519> of<00:03:17.700> Youth<00:03:17.790> is<00:03:18.360> what<00:03:18.690> I'm<00:03:18.780> saying

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:19.290 
Fountain of Youth is what I'm saying

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:22.130 
Fountain of Youth is what I'm saying
so<00:03:19.620> what<00:03:20.430> I'll<00:03:20.580> probably<00:03:20.760> do<00:03:21.180> is<00:03:21.209> go<00:03:21.780> stick

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:22.140 
so what I'll probably do is go stick

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:24.560 
so what I'll probably do is go stick

00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:32.630 
the lot of you guys are iron deficient
this<00:04:30.540> is<00:04:30.660> a<00:04:30.690> really<00:04:30.990> great<00:04:31.200> source<00:04:31.710> of<00:04:31.980> iron<00:04:32.310> or

00:04:32.630 --> 00:04:32.640 
this is a really great source of iron or

00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:35.930 
this is a really great source of iron or
magnesium<00:04:33.360> and<00:04:34.310> you<00:04:35.310> would<00:04:35.430> make<00:04:35.610> enough<00:04:35.910> to

00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:35.940 
magnesium and you would make enough to

00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:38.690 
magnesium and you would make enough to
probably<00:04:36.570> last<00:04:36.780> you<00:04:37.140> about<00:04:37.380> five<00:04:38.250> six<00:04:38.460> days

00:04:38.690 --> 00:04:38.700 
probably last you about five six days

00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:41.630 
probably last you about five six days
and<00:04:39.060> then<00:04:39.120> I<00:04:39.240> would<00:04:39.390> make<00:04:39.570> it<00:04:39.720> again<00:04:40.040> so<00:04:41.040> again

00:04:41.630 --> 00:04:41.640 
and then I would make it again so again

00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:45.110 
and then I would make it again so again
you<00:04:41.910> could<00:04:42.090> put<00:04:42.150> in<00:04:43.160> you<00:04:44.160> can<00:04:44.400> put<00:04:44.580> meat<00:04:44.850> in
