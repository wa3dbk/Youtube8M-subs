00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
step and it requires a little bit of

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:26.510 
step and it requires a little bit of
clarifying<00:01:25.290> if<00:01:25.770> you're<00:01:25.950> connected<00:01:26.340> to<00:01:26.369> the

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
clarifying if you're connected to the

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:28.789 
clarifying if you're connected to the
Internet<00:01:27.000> through<00:01:27.180> a<00:01:27.540> router<00:01:28.140> like<00:01:28.560> you<00:01:28.710> so

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:28.799 
Internet through a router like you so

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:30.499 
Internet through a router like you so
you<00:01:28.890> have<00:01:29.009> your<00:01:29.130> modem<00:01:29.400> that<00:01:29.729> hooks<00:01:30.299> up<00:01:30.479> to

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:30.509 
you have your modem that hooks up to

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:32.030 
you have your modem that hooks up to
either<00:01:30.689> a<00:01:30.810> cable<00:01:31.200> line<00:01:31.380> or<00:01:31.590> your<00:01:31.680> phone<00:01:31.860> line

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
either a cable line or your phone line

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:33.499 
either a cable line or your phone line
then<00:01:32.250> you<00:01:32.369> have<00:01:32.490> a<00:01:32.549> router<00:01:32.909> because<00:01:33.329> you<00:01:33.420> have

00:01:33.499 --> 00:01:33.509 
then you have a router because you have

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:34.609 
then you have a router because you have
multiple<00:01:33.869> things<00:01:33.990> connected<00:01:34.500> you<00:01:34.590> know

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:34.619 
multiple things connected you know

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:37.069 
multiple things connected you know
Wireless<00:01:35.040> etc<00:01:35.579> those<00:01:36.299> have<00:01:36.540> a<00:01:36.570> built-in

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:37.079 
Wireless etc those have a built-in

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:39.920 
Wireless etc those have a built-in
hardware<00:01:37.920> firewall<00:01:38.700> so<00:01:39.420> you<00:01:39.479> don't<00:01:39.720> need

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:39.930 
hardware firewall so you don't need

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:41.270 
hardware firewall so you don't need
Windows<00:01:40.350> Firewall<00:01:40.590> it's<00:01:41.009> most<00:01:41.189> likely

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:41.280 
Windows Firewall it's most likely

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:42.440 
Windows Firewall it's most likely
running<00:01:41.820> especially<00:01:41.939> if<00:01:42.240> you're<00:01:42.329> running

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:42.450 
running especially if you're running

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:44.899 
running especially if you're running
Windows<00:01:42.810> 7<00:01:42.990> and<00:01:43.320> if<00:01:43.950> you<00:01:44.040> don't<00:01:44.220> believe<00:01:44.369> me

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:44.909 
Windows 7 and if you don't believe me

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:47.149 
Windows 7 and if you don't believe me
then<00:01:45.360> just<00:01:45.750> Google<00:01:46.140> for<00:01:46.170> yourself<00:01:46.710> do<00:01:47.100> I

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 
then just Google for yourself do I

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:50.210 
then just Google for yourself do I
really<00:01:47.250> need<00:01:47.670> Windows<00:01:48.240> Firewall<00:01:49.040> there<00:01:50.040> we<00:01:50.130> go

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:50.220 
really need Windows Firewall there we go

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:51.830 
really need Windows Firewall there we go
and<00:01:50.460> I'll<00:01:50.970> read<00:01:51.119> some<00:01:51.299> of<00:01:51.390> these<00:01:51.479> and<00:01:51.750> you'll

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:51.840 
and I'll read some of these and you'll

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:53.810 
and I'll read some of these and you'll
see<00:01:52.049> that<00:01:52.259> you<00:01:52.409> really<00:01:52.710> don't<00:01:52.950> and<00:01:53.640> that's

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:53.820 
see that you really don't and that's

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:55.130 
see that you really don't and that's
most<00:01:54.090> likely<00:01:54.270> blocking<00:01:54.720> your<00:01:54.840> friend<00:01:55.020> from

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:55.140 
most likely blocking your friend from

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:57.859 
most likely blocking your friend from
accessing<00:01:55.770> your<00:01:56.219> server<00:01:56.700> and<00:01:57.000> you<00:01:57.659> could<00:01:57.780> but

00:01:57.859 --> 00:01:57.869 
accessing your server and you could but

00:01:57.869 --> 00:01:59.719 
accessing your server and you could but
I<00:01:57.899> also<00:01:58.049> have<00:01:58.229> them<00:01:58.380> disable<00:01:58.829> it<00:01:58.950> but<00:01:59.490> you<00:01:59.640> know

00:01:59.719 --> 00:01:59.729 
I also have them disable it but you know

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:00.980 
I also have them disable it but you know
you<00:01:59.790> need<00:02:00.030> to<00:02:00.119> be<00:02:00.180> careful<00:02:00.509> and<00:02:00.750> if<00:02:00.899> you're

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:00.990 
you need to be careful and if you're

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:02.510 
you need to be careful and if you're
using<00:02:01.140> a<00:02:01.229> lot<00:02:01.320> of<00:02:01.350> peer-to-peer<00:02:01.740> file<00:02:02.490> sharing

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:02.520 
using a lot of peer-to-peer file sharing

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:05.539 
using a lot of peer-to-peer file sharing
downloading<00:02:03.509> junk<00:02:03.810> programs<00:02:04.320> you<00:02:04.890> know<00:02:05.040> yeah

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:05.549 
downloading junk programs you know yeah

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:06.709 
downloading junk programs you know yeah
you're<00:02:05.700> gonna<00:02:05.820> need<00:02:05.909> an<00:02:06.060> anti-virus<00:02:06.360> for<00:02:06.600> that

00:02:06.709 --> 00:02:06.719 
you're gonna need an anti-virus for that

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:08.270 
you're gonna need an anti-virus for that
but<00:02:07.020> the<00:02:07.110> firewall<00:02:07.469> isn't<00:02:07.649> really<00:02:07.799> necessary

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:08.280 
but the firewall isn't really necessary

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:11.180 
but the firewall isn't really necessary
so<00:02:08.759> I<00:02:08.789> would<00:02:09.030> turn<00:02:09.179> that<00:02:09.390> off<00:02:09.979> so<00:02:10.979> if<00:02:11.099> you

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:11.190 
so I would turn that off so if you

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:12.979 
so I would turn that off so if you
disable<00:02:11.640> Windows<00:02:12.060> Firewall<00:02:12.270> you<00:02:12.750> need<00:02:12.900> to

00:02:12.979 --> 00:02:12.989 
disable Windows Firewall you need to

00:02:12.989 --> 00:02:14.150 
disable Windows Firewall you need to
have<00:02:13.080> your<00:02:13.200> friend<00:02:13.440> trying<00:02:13.620> to<00:02:13.680> connect

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:14.160 
have your friend trying to connect

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:16.280 
have your friend trying to connect
with<00:02:14.340> that<00:02:14.460> same<00:02:14.670> IP<00:02:14.940> you<00:02:15.240> gave<00:02:15.420> them<00:02:15.750> earlier

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:16.290 
with that same IP you gave them earlier

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:17.660 
with that same IP you gave them earlier
there's<00:02:16.710> a<00:02:16.770> really<00:02:17.100> good<00:02:17.220> chance<00:02:17.400> that<00:02:17.520> they

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:17.670 
there's a really good chance that they

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:19.820 
there's a really good chance that they
can<00:02:17.850> connect<00:02:18.210> now<00:02:18.420> with<00:02:19.200> the<00:02:19.320> exception<00:02:19.800> that

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:19.830 
can connect now with the exception that

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:21.590 
can connect now with the exception that
if<00:02:20.220> you're<00:02:20.400> having<00:02:20.610> people<00:02:21.000> try<00:02:21.210> to<00:02:21.240> connect

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:21.600 
if you're having people try to connect

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:24.320 
if you're having people try to connect
you<00:02:21.690> haven't<00:02:22.020> bought<00:02:22.260> minecraft<00:02:23.000> to<00:02:24.000> change

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:24.330 
you haven't bought minecraft to change

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:26.510 
you haven't bought minecraft to change
that<00:02:24.720> so<00:02:24.930> that<00:02:24.960> they<00:02:25.260> can<00:02:25.590> connect<00:02:26.010> you're

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:26.520 
that so that they can connect you're

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:28.370 
that so that they can connect you're
going<00:02:26.790> to<00:02:26.970> want<00:02:27.450> to<00:02:27.630> watch<00:02:27.840> this<00:02:28.020> video<00:02:28.200> right

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:28.380 
going to want to watch this video right

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:30.800 
going to want to watch this video right
here<00:02:29.010> it's<00:02:29.250> really<00:02:29.640> simple<00:02:29.970> how<00:02:30.180> to<00:02:30.240> fix<00:02:30.510> that

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:30.810 
here it's really simple how to fix that

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:33.320 
here it's really simple how to fix that
how<00:02:31.680> to<00:02:31.740> let<00:02:32.100> people<00:02:32.490> who<00:02:32.580> are<00:02:32.700> not<00:02:32.880> premium

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:33.330 
how to let people who are not premium

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:34.730 
how to let people who are not premium
connected<00:02:34.140> to<00:02:34.230> your<00:02:34.380> server

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:34.740 
connected to your server

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:36.680 
connected to your server
again<00:02:35.040> make<00:02:35.820> sure<00:02:35.850> that<00:02:36.240> you<00:02:36.360> trust<00:02:36.600> these

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:36.690 
again make sure that you trust these

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:38.240 
again make sure that you trust these
people<00:02:36.780> they<00:02:37.290> connect<00:02:37.590> to<00:02:37.710> your<00:02:37.800> server<00:02:37.920> that

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:38.250 
people they connect to your server that

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:40.520 
people they connect to your server that
are<00:02:38.370> you<00:02:38.700> know<00:02:38.790> not<00:02:38.940> premium<00:02:39.300> now<00:02:40.230> if<00:02:40.380> they

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:40.530 
are you know not premium now if they

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:42.470 
are you know not premium now if they
still<00:02:40.800> can't<00:02:41.070> connect<00:02:41.370> to<00:02:41.430> your<00:02:41.640> server<00:02:41.880> after

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:42.480 
still can't connect to your server after

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:44.030 
still can't connect to your server after
that<00:02:42.690> you're<00:02:42.900> going<00:02:43.020> to<00:02:43.050> want<00:02:43.260> to<00:02:43.380> try<00:02:43.980> to

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:44.040 
that you're going to want to try to

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:46.400 
that you're going to want to try to
forward<00:02:44.850> the<00:02:45.060> port's<00:02:45.390> this<00:02:45.720> is<00:02:45.840> a<00:02:45.870> little<00:02:46.260> more

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:46.410 
forward the port's this is a little more

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:48.320 
forward the port's this is a little more
complicated<00:02:46.740> but<00:02:47.280> it's<00:02:47.670> a<00:02:48.120> permanent

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:48.330 
complicated but it's a permanent

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:51.020 
complicated but it's a permanent
solution<00:02:48.630> we'll<00:02:49.530> fix<00:02:49.860> it<00:02:50.040> for<00:02:50.400> you<00:02:50.550> so<00:02:50.790> grab<00:02:51.000> a

solution we'll fix it for you so grab a
pen<00:02:51.330> and<00:02:51.360> paper<00:02:51.630> and<00:02:51.930> your<00:02:52.740> iPod<00:02:53.040> or<00:02:53.130> something

tunnel through the internet just like
hamachi<00:05:40.500> and<00:05:40.860> then<00:05:41.250> you<00:05:41.310> give<00:05:41.430> them<00:05:41.520> that<00:05:41.550> IP

00:05:41.750 --> 00:05:41.760
