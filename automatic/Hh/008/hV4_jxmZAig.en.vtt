environment<00:05:30.970> bacteria<00:05:32.850> reproduces<00:05:33.850> an

00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:34.210 
environment bacteria reproduces an

00:05:34.210 --> 00:05:36.210 
environment bacteria reproduces an
exponential<00:05:34.960> rate<00:05:35.110> it's<00:05:35.350> two<00:05:35.650> to<00:05:35.890> the<00:05:36.039> power

00:05:36.210 --> 00:05:36.220 
exponential rate it's two to the power

00:05:36.220 --> 00:05:39.090 
exponential rate it's two to the power
of<00:05:36.460> n<00:05:36.729> oh<00:05:36.970> but<00:05:37.479> is<00:05:37.720> the<00:05:38.050> issue<00:05:38.229> in<00:05:38.410> a<00:05:38.470> humid<00:05:38.800> area

00:05:39.090 --> 00:05:39.100 
of n oh but is the issue in a humid area

00:05:39.100 --> 00:05:40.830 
of n oh but is the issue in a humid area
like<00:05:39.430> she's<00:05:39.640> in<00:05:39.760> Florida<00:05:39.880> or<00:05:40.240> some<00:05:40.390> shit

like she's in Florida or some shit

00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:43.710 
like she's in Florida or some shit
because<00:05:41.110> humidity<00:05:41.770> fucking<00:05:42.220> breeds<00:05:42.910> bacteria

00:05:43.710 --> 00:05:43.720 
because humidity fucking breeds bacteria

00:05:43.720 --> 00:05:45.990 
because humidity fucking breeds bacteria
like<00:05:43.900> a<00:05:43.930> lot<00:05:44.200> of<00:05:44.229> bullshit<00:05:44.770> if<00:05:45.190> the<00:05:45.550> stuff<00:05:45.820> is

00:05:45.990 --> 00:05:46.000 
like a lot of bullshit if the stuff is

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:48.180 
like a lot of bullshit if the stuff is
flowing<00:05:46.570> like<00:05:46.600> blood<00:05:47.110> or<00:05:47.260> something<00:05:47.530> it<00:05:48.039> needs

00:05:48.180 --> 00:05:48.190 
flowing like blood or something it needs

00:05:48.190 --> 00:05:50.490

00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:52.570 
then that bacteria that 2 to the N

00:05:52.570 --> 00:06:01.529
