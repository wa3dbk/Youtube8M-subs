00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:10.280
Hello I teach a very simple and 
practical way to make tomato sauce.

00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:16.880
To begin, put a pan with enough water 
to cover the tomatoes to a boil.

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:22.760
As the water boils, wash the tomatoes.

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:28.720
Now that the water has boiled, put 6 tomatoes,

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:33.960
careful not to burn your hand

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:37.800
and left until the skin split.

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:42.960
Now that the skin of the tomato cracked,

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:45.840
I'll put in a blender.

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:50.880
it takes about 1 minute with boiling water.

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:05.640
The first time, put a little water to help beat.

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:25.760
Pass through a sieve

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:29.680
and leave some for the next tomatoes.

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:50.200
After processing, place in a saucepan 
over high heat until boiling.

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:53.800
Taking care not to overflow.

00:01:55.040 --> 00:02:00.760
Lower the heat, put the lid half open and cook.

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:05.040
Remember not to put any seasoning nor salt.

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:08.880
This is the point that the sauce has to be

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:11.160
to consume or freeze.

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:15.560
