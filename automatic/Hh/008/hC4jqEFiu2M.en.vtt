00:00:02.470 --> 00:00:06.399
 this time we are going to focus on 

00:00:04.510 --> 00:00:08.769
 the smallest ones in the house to 

00:00:06.399 --> 00:00:11.410
 entertain them and have fun let's 

00:00:08.769 --> 00:00:14.140
 make plasticine the materials that 

00:00:11.410 --> 00:00:17.050
 we are going to need are flour 

00:00:14.140 --> 00:00:19.810
 a cup three quarters of a cup of water 

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:22.840
 half a cup of salt a spoonful of 

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:24.470
 cooking or drinking oil that you 

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:26.150
 you prefer 

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:29.410
 in a container where you can mix 

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:29.410
 everything and a spoon 

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:39.129
 this time the little one in this house 

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:42.730
 well in fact the most of the little ones what 

00:00:39.129 --> 00:00:44.559
 bigger is going to help me do this 

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:46.660
 mix she loves to do this 

00:00:44.559 --> 00:00:49.000
 I hope that the little ones in your 

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:52.089
 house also like let's mix 

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:55.300
 first what are the dry materials 

00:00:52.089 --> 00:00:58.920
 we will put the flour and salt in 

00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:58.920
 the container and we will mix it well 

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:06.190
 after we have made this mixture 

00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:09.210
 let's add the cup pardon the 

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:09.210
 teaspoon of oil 

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:16.990
 and three quarters of a cup of water 

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:20.470
 and we will continue mixing this until forming 

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:22.180
 If you paste is too watery you 

00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:23.550
 you can add a little more flour 

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:26.720
 so you have a better consistency 

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:28.620
 It must be like a cookie 

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:30.720
 firm 

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:33.060
 I made four rolls after 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:34.980
 I finished helping my girl to knead 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:38.250
 all because obviously she could not 

00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:40.740
 doing it all alone I made four rolls and 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:43.290
 I put them in separate disposable dishes 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:45.200
 I made a little hole in the center and there 

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:49.200
 It was where I put a little paint 

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:52.320
 acrylic of the basic colors I used 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:54.120
 the red the blue the yellow and the green 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:55.920
 let's add the color as 

00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:58.320
 necessary 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:01.860
 I show it to you quickly so you can 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:03.509
 see everything and finally this is how they are 

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:06.390
 the colors really is something very 

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:08.489
 simple to make very practical you can 

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:10.530
 do at home with your little ones before 

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:12.480
 to add paint even what 

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:15.300
 you could microwave a minute 

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:16.680
 nothing happens not cooked all leave 

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:19.080
 cool for a while and then go back to 

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:21.209
 Mix the dough once more or if not 

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:24.900
 you can go through it by a pan 

00:02:21.209 --> 00:02:27.750
 hot and give and go around and 

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:30.090
 keep kneading what is the mass of the 

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:32.519
 putty this so that for you 

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:34.200
 last longer you can add 

00:02:32.519 --> 00:02:35.790
 also a teaspoon of vinegar for 

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:37.890
 prevent it from being spoiled or having 

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:41.340
 a bad smell 

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:44.250
 and finally we keep it in some 

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:47.260
 closed container that has a lid or if 

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:51.879
 not what we can do 

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:53.620
 is to add forgiveness or if not what 

00:02:51.879 --> 00:02:55.630
 we can do is save the sachets of 

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:57.400
 plastic 

00:02:55.630 --> 00:03:00.670
 so that children can play with it 

00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:01.780

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:03.820
