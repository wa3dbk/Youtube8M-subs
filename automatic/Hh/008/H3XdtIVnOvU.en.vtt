00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
little bit deeper than that I think a

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:56.360 
little bit deeper than that I think a
lot<00:00:54.629> of<00:00:54.660> these<00:00:54.899> things<00:00:54.960> about<00:00:55.469> people<00:00:56.250> getting

just<00:01:29.100> like<00:01:29.250> I<00:01:29.520> think<00:01:30.270> so<00:01:30.840> much<00:01:31.079> of<00:01:31.110> everything

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:31.409 
just like I think so much of everything

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:34.460 
just like I think so much of everything
is<00:01:31.890> just<00:01:32.040> following<00:01:32.579> the<00:01:32.610> crowd<00:01:33.060> mostly<00:01:33.869> and

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
is just following the crowd mostly and

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:36.560 
is just following the crowd mostly and
you<00:01:34.710> know<00:01:34.860> kind<00:01:35.159> of<00:01:35.250> it's<00:01:36.000> kind<00:01:36.119> of<00:01:36.210> like<00:01:36.390> you

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
you know kind of it's kind of like you

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:40.039 
you know kind of it's kind of like you
do<00:01:36.780> what's<00:01:36.990> expected<00:01:37.140> of<00:01:37.710> you<00:01:37.950> in<00:01:38.130> a<00:01:38.640> way<00:01:39.049> yeah

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:40.049 
do what's expected of you in a way yeah

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:41.929 
do what's expected of you in a way yeah
I<00:01:40.290> guess<00:01:40.590> so<00:01:40.770> I<00:01:40.799> mean<00:01:41.070> I<00:01:41.220> think<00:01:41.250> it's<00:01:41.430> like<00:01:41.670> I

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:41.939 
I guess so I mean I think it's like I

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:43.940 
I guess so I mean I think it's like I
think<00:01:42.689> it's<00:01:42.810> like<00:01:42.899> a<00:01:42.990> chain<00:01:43.200> reaction<00:01:43.350> type<00:01:43.799> of

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950 
think it's like a chain reaction type of

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:46.280 
think it's like a chain reaction type of
thing<00:01:44.100> like<00:01:44.340> when<00:01:45.119> if<00:01:45.570> someone<00:01:45.930> would<00:01:46.049> like<00:01:46.170> to

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290 
thing like when if someone would like to

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:48.080 
thing like when if someone would like to
see<00:01:46.439> that<00:01:46.560> like<00:01:46.799> someone<00:01:47.549> got<00:01:47.579> in<00:01:47.820> trouble<00:01:47.939> for

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090 
see that like someone got in trouble for

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:49.999 
see that like someone got in trouble for
doing<00:01:48.270> this<00:01:48.509> and<00:01:48.570> then<00:01:48.869> like<00:01:49.049> why<00:01:49.290> why<00:01:49.740> can't<00:01:49.950> I

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:50.009 
doing this and then like why why can't I

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:51.200 
doing this and then like why why can't I
get<00:01:50.070> them<00:01:50.340> in<00:01:50.460> trouble<00:01:50.549> for<00:01:50.820> if<00:01:50.880> they<00:01:51.000> tried

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.210 
get them in trouble for if they tried

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:52.340 
get them in trouble for if they tried
doing<00:01:51.360> this<00:01:51.450> to<00:01:51.600> me<00:01:51.720> if<00:01:51.810> they<00:01:51.930> try<00:01:52.079> Paul<00:01:52.259> on

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350 
doing this to me if they try Paul on

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:55.010 
doing this to me if they try Paul on
that<00:01:52.549> and<00:01:53.549> I<00:01:53.790> think<00:01:54.149> that's<00:01:54.299> a<00:01:54.450> way<00:01:54.600> with<00:01:54.869> like

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020 
that and I think that's a way with like

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:56.389 
that and I think that's a way with like
a<00:01:55.049> lot<00:01:55.320> of<00:01:55.470> things<00:01:55.649> not<00:01:55.860> only<00:01:55.890> look<00:01:56.369> like

00:01:56.389 --> 00:01:56.399 
a lot of things not only look like

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:58.249 
a lot of things not only look like
there's<00:01:56.759> some<00:01:57.000> areas<00:01:57.390> I've<00:01:57.540> seen<00:01:57.840> like<00:01:58.110> they

00:01:58.249 --> 00:01:58.259 
there's some areas I've seen like they

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:00.139 
there's some areas I've seen like they
like<00:01:58.500> do<00:01:58.649> full<00:01:58.890> body<00:01:59.189> searches<00:01:59.759> which<00:01:59.909> means

00:02:00.139 --> 00:02:00.149 
like do full body searches which means

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:01.670 
like do full body searches which means

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:06.600 
there and I mean sometimes there's a

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:08.479 
there and I mean sometimes there's a
need<00:02:06.810> for<00:02:07.049> that<00:02:07.170> favourite<00:02:08.009> sure<00:02:08.160> that<00:02:08.310> made
