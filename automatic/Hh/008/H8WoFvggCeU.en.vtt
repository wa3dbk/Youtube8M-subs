00:03:46.210 --> 00:03:46.220 
neat feature that this has is that

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:48.190 
neat feature that this has is that
you're<00:03:46.400> actually<00:03:46.790> able<00:03:46.970> to<00:03:47.150> go<00:03:47.660> into<00:03:48.020> your

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:48.200 
you're actually able to go into your

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:50.830 
you're actually able to go into your
zones<00:03:48.590> and<00:03:49.190> let's<00:03:49.940> say<00:03:50.090> you<00:03:50.150> want<00:03:50.390> to<00:03:50.420> bypass

00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:50.840 
zones and let's say you want to bypass

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:53.410 
zones and let's say you want to bypass
something<00:03:51.850> we'll<00:03:52.850> say<00:03:53.030> we're<00:03:53.240> going<00:03:53.360> to

00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:53.420 
something we'll say we're going to

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:55.180 
something we'll say we're going to
bypass<00:03:53.600> the<00:03:53.990> motion<00:03:54.380> detector<00:03:54.830> so<00:03:55.040> we'll

00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:55.190 
bypass the motion detector so we'll

00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:57.100 
bypass the motion detector so we'll
bypass<00:03:55.370> the<00:03:55.820> motion<00:03:56.180> detector<00:03:56.630> will<00:03:57.020> of

00:03:57.100 --> 00:03:57.110 
bypass the motion detector will of

00:03:57.110 --> 00:04:03.400 
bypass the motion detector will of
course<00:03:57.290> type<00:03:57.590> in<00:03:57.770> our<00:03:57.920> code<00:03:58.930> submit<00:04:02.410> it's

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:03.410 
course type in our code submit it's

00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:05.350 
course type in our code submit it's
going<00:04:03.560> to<00:04:03.620> bypass<00:04:03.980> that<00:04:04.040> for<00:04:04.550> us<00:04:04.700> we're<00:04:05.180> done

00:04:05.350 --> 00:04:05.360 
going to bypass that for us we're done

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:09.550 
going to bypass that for us we're done
bypassing<00:04:06.110> and<00:04:06.320> then<00:04:07.900> let's<00:04:08.900> say<00:04:09.080> we<00:04:09.110> arm<00:04:09.410> away

00:04:09.550 --> 00:04:09.560 
bypassing and then let's say we arm away

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:16.509 
bypassing and then let's say we arm away
since<00:04:10.310> that<00:04:10.490> would<00:04:10.640> bypass<00:04:10.790> the<00:04:11.240> motion

00:04:16.509 --> 00:04:16.519 

00:04:16.519 --> 00:04:27.920 

armed<00:04:17.519> away<00:04:25.580> like<00:04:26.580> that<00:04:26.610> which<00:04:27.540> means<00:04:27.750> that

00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:27.930 
armed away like that which means that

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:38.890 
armed away like that which means that
that's<00:04:28.470> what<00:04:28.770> it<00:04:35.960> it<00:04:36.960> does<00:04:37.260> great<00:04:37.950> you<00:04:38.250> are

00:04:38.890 --> 00:04:38.900 
that's what it it does great you are

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:43.430 
that's what it it does great you are
good<00:04:39.900> at<00:04:40.020> this<00:04:40.139> on<00:04:41.360> once<00:04:42.360> you<00:04:42.540> disarm<00:04:43.020> so<00:04:43.260> once

00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:43.440 
good at this on once you disarm so once

00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:45.560 
good at this on once you disarm so once
you<00:04:43.530> go<00:04:43.680> through<00:04:43.710> a<00:04:44.130> full<00:04:44.520> cycle<00:04:44.550> of<00:04:45.060> arming

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:45.570 
you go through a full cycle of arming

00:04:45.570 --> 00:04:48.140 
you go through a full cycle of arming
and<00:04:45.690> disarming<00:04:46.080> on<00:04:46.530> your<00:04:46.740> phone<00:04:46.950> the<00:04:47.669> bypass

00:04:48.140 --> 00:04:48.150 
and disarming on your phone the bypass

00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:50.330 
and disarming on your phone the bypass
will<00:04:48.570> have<00:04:48.750> gone<00:04:48.930> away<00:04:49.230> so<00:04:49.290> the<00:04:49.620> bypass<00:04:50.010> only

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:50.340 
will have gone away so the bypass only

00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:52.850 
will have gone away so the bypass only
works<00:04:50.520> for<00:04:50.730> one<00:04:50.970> arm<00:04:51.270> cycle<00:04:51.780> if<00:04:51.960> you<00:04:52.140> bypass<00:04:52.350> in

00:04:52.850 --> 00:04:52.860 
works for one arm cycle if you bypass in

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:54.980 
works for one arm cycle if you bypass in
an<00:04:52.980> arm<00:04:53.190> your<00:04:53.370> system<00:04:53.550> once<00:04:54.330> you<00:04:54.419> disarm<00:04:54.870> it

00:04:54.980 --> 00:04:54.990 
an arm your system once you disarm it

00:04:54.990 --> 00:04:57.470 
an arm your system once you disarm it
then<00:04:55.169> the<00:04:55.290> bypass<00:04:55.650> clears<00:04:56.040> out<00:04:56.250> so<00:04:56.669> the<00:04:57.240> next

00:04:57.470 --> 00:04:57.480 
then the bypass clears out so the next

00:04:57.480 --> 00:04:59.030 
then the bypass clears out so the next
time<00:04:57.690> that<00:04:57.840> you<00:04:57.900> arm<00:04:58.050> your<00:04:58.200> system<00:04:58.350> it<00:04:58.830> won't

00:04:59.030 --> 00:04:59.040 
time that you arm your system it won't

00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:01.010 
time that you arm your system it won't
have<00:04:59.160> anything<00:04:59.400> by<00:04:59.669> pest<00:04:59.970> just<00:05:00.600> kind<00:05:00.810> of<00:05:00.840> keep

00:05:01.010 --> 00:05:01.020 
have anything by pest just kind of keep

00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:02.390 
have anything by pest just kind of keep
that<00:05:01.169> in<00:05:01.230> mind<00:05:01.530> whenever<00:05:01.710> you're<00:05:01.919> working

00:05:02.390 --> 00:05:02.400 
that in mind whenever you're working

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:03.710 
that in mind whenever you're working
with<00:05:02.550> bypassing<00:05:03.180> and<00:05:03.270> things<00:05:03.480> like<00:05:03.660> that

00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:03.720 
with bypassing and things like that

00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:06.080 
with bypassing and things like that
because<00:05:04.050> you<00:05:04.440> can<00:05:04.470> upon<00:05:05.070> accident<00:05:05.280> arm<00:05:05.790> things

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:06.090 
because you can upon accident arm things

00:05:06.090 --> 00:05:07.880 
because you can upon accident arm things
that<00:05:06.300> you<00:05:06.419> don't<00:05:06.630> want<00:05:06.810> armed<00:05:07.080> if<00:05:07.320> you<00:05:07.710> don't

00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:07.890 
that you don't want armed if you don't

00:05:07.890 --> 00:05:10.190 
that you don't want armed if you don't
realize<00:05:08.070> that<00:05:08.280> it<00:05:08.850> will<00:05:09.060> buy<00:05:09.240> only<00:05:09.479> bypass<00:05:09.930> for

00:05:10.190 --> 00:05:10.200 
realize that it will buy only bypass for

00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:12.440 
realize that it will buy only bypass for
one<00:05:10.380> orange<00:05:10.680> cycle<00:05:11.100> thanks<00:05:12.000> for<00:05:12.150> watching

00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:12.450 
one orange cycle thanks for watching

00:05:12.450 --> 00:05:15.650 
one orange cycle thanks for watching
guys<00:05:12.570> hope<00:05:12.990> y'all<00:05:13.200> have<00:05:13.320> a<00:05:13.350> great<00:05:13.500> day
