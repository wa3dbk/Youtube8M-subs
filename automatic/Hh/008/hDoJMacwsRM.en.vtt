00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.570
 hello people welcome to 

00:00:01.410 --> 00:00:05.730
 this new edition from veggie day my 

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:08.309
 car together my absolutely favorite 

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:10.170
 Indian classic dish and that is 

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:11.490
 the alu kobe that is a cauliflower 

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:14.460
 potatoes curry 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:16.770
 that's different with carabas 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:19.380
 spice blend he spice as with one 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:21.420
 normal cafÃ© is mega rica is available in 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:23.279
 India in a thousand different variations 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:24.570
 every family of your own recipe i 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:26.010
 I always put that if I did not 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:27.810
 what else to take 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:30.660
 on the map because I always knew that 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:31.980
 every time different and every time mega and 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:38.670
 I'll show you how the money goes now 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:40.710
 is it for this classic of 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:43.290
 indian cuisine alu gobi needs her 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:45.870
 following ingredients 400 grams firm-cooking 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:48.989
 potatoes 500 grams of cauliflower three 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:52.260
 tomatoes onions about a thumb 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:54.270
 big piece ginger so about 5 cm then 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:56.579
 four tablespoons of vegetable g or 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:58.829
 coconut oil I have recently been herbal 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:00.600
 asia ordered market gm I had to 

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:02.579
 my hall also shown that I can 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:03.989
 So I recommend it because Japan is fat 

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:06.450
 is in there and I would actually 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:08.369
 rather refrain from it because the salary 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:09.750
 rainforest for cutting down does not stop 

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:12.000
 exactly where it comes from 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:14.250
 then you need salt- grounded salt 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.080
 cumin garam masala that is one 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:18.869
 spice mix is available in every asia 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:20.880
 Market or stop at the indoor then needs 

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:23.100
 I like the curry powder the most 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:25.439
 madras with curry also from the asia market 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:27.810
 and not some supermarket curry 

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:30.869
 then something sugar or you can 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:32.640
 naturally agave thick juice or coconut 

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:34.200
 blossom sugar or so I believe 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:35.880
 That gives the whole thing once again 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:37.979
 delicious note maybe or palms 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:39.509
 sugar so it's a bit of a master 

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:41.700
 or so you can certainly still 

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:44.009
 time to experiment because turmeric 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:45.930
 coconut milk and water and then it works 

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:48.060
 already go by simply by the 

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:49.560
 cauliflower florets separated individual 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:52.110
 and the whole in bite-sized pieces 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:54.509
 slices the potatoes and peels 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:56.700
 also the tomatoes in medium size 

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:59.130
 So pieces cut both and me 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:00.360
 was very finely cut and 

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:02.009
 then you start that way 

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:03.960
 you guys take the biggest flag you 

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:06.030
 because you really need space for 

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:08.700
 this court will become one 

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:10.080
 huge portion and in it two tablespoons 

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:11.820
 from your fed 

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:16.950
 maybe it's really more like coconut oil 

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:19.620
 as take and heat that up in and 

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:22.020
 then put the cauliflower in it 

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:23.570
 so roast it for about five minutes 

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:26.010
 the stop really so beautiful rust 

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:28.140
 develop and then the whole thing too 

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:30.180
 directly add salt then after that all the 

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:33.510
 put side and in the pan again 

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:35.220
 Heat two tablespoons of fat in it 

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:37.350
 the potatoes for five minutes 

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:39.290
 roast and also salt a little 

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:41.460
 and then add the onion 

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:43.950
 of course, watch out that the whole thing is not 

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:45.990
 burns on and about five minutes further 

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:48.420
 would then have the ginger and the spices 

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:51.180
 mix in and add the tomatoes 

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:52.890
 and cook for another two minutes 

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:56.100
 always a bit walls 

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:58.080
 do not give too much heat to it and if 

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:59.700
 then everything is nicely done he gives 

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:01.980
 then there's the water and the coconut milk 

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:03.209
 to and leaves the whole thing with it and 

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:04.020
 could then also the cauliflower again 

00:03:03.209 --> 00:03:06.180
 Add 

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:08.280
 Incidentally , I'm looking for recently from dr georg 

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:10.830
 Try the coconut milk and it 

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:12.780
 really better in the long run 

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:14.550
 video see it normal from dr georg 

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:15.870
 I have to be there by the ton 

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:17.430
 order again 

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:19.350
 if not in which load is 

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:21.420
 who else to buy except online 

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:24.090
 and that is I think it's like so 

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:25.830
 one fit so rich and so 

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:28.350
 that only coconut milk I really have 

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:29.550
 you have never seen an absolute hit 

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:30.870
 be sure to try if we have the 

00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:33.180
 you do not know you yet you can too 

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:35.670
 not yet , but you leave that alone 

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:38.610
 whole then just stop with a lid 

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:41.790
 30 minutes at medium heat even 

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:43.739
 and maybe five minutes before maybe 

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:45.269
 take off the lid so that the whole one 

00:03:43.739 --> 00:03:47.850
 a bit more one reduces depending on 

00:03:45.269 --> 00:03:49.920
 how much sauce you have and would like to have 

00:03:47.850 --> 00:03:52.440
 and then taste everything with 

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:54.239
 salt and sugar and then very much 

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:56.070
 many together with rice or with dad 

00:03:54.239 --> 00:03:57.989
 damms or even with a little bit 

00:03:56.070 --> 00:04:00.840
 chili garnished or should be around the whole 

00:03:57.989 --> 00:04:02.220
 give it a juicy note again 

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:04.860
 depending on the stop how much sharper 

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:06.330
 Curry powder already has it all 

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:08.670
 keep here is more or less 

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:10.230
 Schily tolerated and I, we hope 

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:12.690
 Also from this recipe is really 

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:14.820
 an absolute classic of omega yummy 

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:16.830
 yes that was already the recipe as 

00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:18.000
 That said my absolute favorite 

00:04:16.830 --> 00:04:21.359
 out in 

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:23.370
 and I always like doing that 

00:04:21.359 --> 00:04:24.900
 really an absolute classic too 

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:28.080
 There are 1000 different spellings 

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:30.210
 In any case, argovia as a term or 

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:31.970
 as title for this kind of recipes that 

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:34.830
 is just just flowers Polcari 

00:04:31.970 --> 00:04:36.090
 or cauliflower a pot of something in the 

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:38.330
 direction does not necessarily talk then 

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:41.760
 fluent English actually not at all 

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:43.080
 but well as I said is my absolute 

00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:44.400
 favorite dish and i hope im 

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:46.740

 I'm glad about that though 

00:04:53.669 --> 00:04:57.360

00:04:55.290 --> 00:04:59.340

00:04:57.360 --> 00:05:01.320

00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:05.610
