some<00:00:08.910> of<00:00:08.940> these<00:00:09.059> guys<00:00:09.269> are<00:00:09.570> shooting<00:00:09.690> these

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:09.870 
some of these guys are shooting these

some of these guys are shooting these
over<00:00:10.110> leases<00:00:10.469> it's<00:00:10.650> 10<00:00:10.830> 12<00:00:11.130> years<00:00:11.190> old<00:00:11.580> and

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:11.790 
over leases it's 10 12 years old and

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:13.580 
over leases it's 10 12 years old and
just<00:00:11.969> about<00:00:12.120> to<00:00:12.240> fall<00:00:12.420> apart<00:00:12.570> and<00:00:12.990> I<00:00:13.110> think

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:13.590 
just about to fall apart and I think

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:15.230 
just about to fall apart and I think
people<00:00:13.740> underestimate<00:00:14.099> how<00:00:14.580> important<00:00:15.089> it<00:00:15.179> is

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:15.240 
people underestimate how important it is

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:17.000 
people underestimate how important it is
to<00:00:15.480> have<00:00:15.509> a<00:00:15.690> good<00:00:15.990> release<00:00:16.320> and<00:00:16.619> it<00:00:16.680> comes<00:00:16.890> to

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:17.010 
to have a good release and it comes to

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:18.859 
to have a good release and it comes to
your<00:00:17.100> shooting<00:00:17.460> and<00:00:17.640> how<00:00:18.180> your<00:00:18.359> accuracy<00:00:18.720> is

00:00:18.859 --> 00:00:18.869 
your shooting and how your accuracy is

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:20.330 
your shooting and how your accuracy is
going<00:00:18.990> to<00:00:19.050> be<00:00:19.230> in<00:00:19.410> your<00:00:19.470> consistency<00:00:20.039> you<00:00:20.189> know

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:20.340 
going to be in your consistency you know

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:21.890 
going to be in your consistency you know
we<00:00:20.460> shoot<00:00:20.640> Scott<00:00:20.970> releases<00:00:21.510> and<00:00:21.630> there's<00:00:21.750> an

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:21.900 
we shoot Scott releases and there's an

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:23.450 
we shoot Scott releases and there's an
obvious<00:00:22.020> reason<00:00:22.529> for<00:00:22.680> that<00:00:22.800> they've<00:00:23.310> been

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:23.460 
obvious reason for that they've been

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:25.340 
obvious reason for that they've been
around<00:00:23.699> forever<00:00:23.970> there<00:00:24.420> a<00:00:24.449> guaranteed<00:00:25.080> deal

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:25.350 
around forever there a guaranteed deal

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:26.689 
around forever there a guaranteed deal
man<00:00:25.650> I<00:00:25.680> mean<00:00:25.920> these<00:00:26.010> things<00:00:26.070> are<00:00:26.430> one<00:00:26.580> hundred

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:26.699 
man I mean these things are one hundred

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:29.179 
man I mean these things are one hundred
percent<00:00:27.500> american-made<00:00:28.500> I've<00:00:28.740> got<00:00:28.859> a<00:00:28.890> can't

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:29.189 
percent american-made I've got a can't

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:30.800 
percent american-made I've got a can't
beat<00:00:29.400> it<00:00:29.429> guarantee<00:00:30.029> which<00:00:30.240> means<00:00:30.449> if<00:00:30.630> it's

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:30.810 
beat it guarantee which means if it's

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:33.049 
beat it guarantee which means if it's
something<00:00:31.410> breaks<00:00:31.830> or<00:00:32.130> something<00:00:32.700> happens

00:00:33.049 --> 00:00:33.059 
something breaks or something happens

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:35.720 
something breaks or something happens
they'll<00:00:33.270> either<00:00:33.390> replace<00:00:33.809> it<00:00:34.050> or<00:00:34.170> fix<00:00:35.010> it<00:00:35.250> no

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:35.730 
they'll either replace it or fix it no

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:37.190 
they'll either replace it or fix it no
questions<00:00:36.149> asked<00:00:36.510> and<00:00:36.570> get<00:00:36.719> it<00:00:36.809> back<00:00:36.989> to<00:00:37.020> you

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:37.200 
questions asked and get it back to you

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:45.270 
different styles of connectors they got

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:47.600 
different styles of connectors they got
a<00:00:45.300> nylon<00:00:45.750> strap<00:00:46.140> that<00:00:47.070> will<00:00:47.219> basically<00:00:47.370> allow

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
a nylon strap that will basically allow

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:49.490 
a nylon strap that will basically allow
that<00:00:47.789> release<00:00:48.180> to<00:00:48.360> just<00:00:48.539> kind<00:00:48.690> of<00:00:48.750> fall<00:00:49.200> down

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500 
that release to just kind of fall down

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:51.619 
that release to just kind of fall down
on<00:00:49.530> your<00:00:49.890> arm<00:00:50.100> as<00:00:50.250> you're<00:00:50.399> climbing<00:00:50.670> or<00:00:51.030> doing

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360 
and they've got a solid one which is

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:59.150 
and they've got a solid one which is
basically<00:00:57.719> a<00:00:57.840> hard<00:00:58.109> shaft<00:00:58.469> that<00:00:58.739> runs<00:00:58.859> all<00:00:59.129> the

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160

way<00:00:59.280> from<00:00:59.399> the<00:00:59.640> end<00:00:59.969> or<00:01:00.090> release<00:01:00.329> all<00:01:00.570> the<00:01:00.719> way

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
way from the end or release all the way

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:03.170 
way from the end or release all the way
back<00:01:00.989> to<00:01:01.199> the<00:01:01.430> connector<00:01:02.430> to<00:01:02.579> the<00:01:02.609> strap<00:01:02.940> and

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
back to the connector to the strap and

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:04.910 
back to the connector to the strap and
they've<00:01:03.690> got<00:01:03.719> a<00:01:03.840> hybrid<00:01:04.350> that<00:01:04.439> is<00:01:04.559> a<00:01:04.589> little

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
they've got a hybrid that is a little

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:06.530 
they've got a hybrid that is a little
bit<00:01:05.010> of<00:01:05.040> both<00:01:05.250> you<00:01:05.549> know<00:01:05.670> which<00:01:05.790> is<00:01:05.970> obviously

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
bit of both you know which is obviously

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:08.870 
bit of both you know which is obviously
that<00:01:06.659> kind<00:01:06.960> of<00:01:06.990> explains<00:01:07.229> itself<00:01:07.680> so<00:01:07.920> the

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
that kind of explains itself so the

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:09.800 
that kind of explains itself so the
other<00:01:09.000> thing<00:01:09.090> there's<00:01:09.450> several<00:01:09.689> different

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
other thing there's several different

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:11.630 
other thing there's several different
types<00:01:10.170> of<00:01:10.350> class<00:01:10.590> you<00:01:10.830> can<00:01:10.950> get<00:01:11.189> you<00:01:11.369> get<00:01:11.520> the

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
types of class you can get you get the

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:13.640 
types of class you can get you get the
double<00:01:11.939> class<00:01:12.150> the<00:01:12.450> single<00:01:12.810> class<00:01:13.049> or<00:01:13.380> the<00:01:13.470> one

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650 
double class the single class or the one

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:14.990 
double class the single class or the one
that's<00:01:13.799> got<00:01:13.920> just<00:01:14.130> a<00:01:14.220> hook<00:01:14.400> like<00:01:14.430> the<00:01:14.760> saber

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 
that's got just a hook like the saber

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.690 
that's got just a hook like the saber
hook<00:01:15.650> there<00:01:16.650> again<00:01:16.950> a<00:01:16.979> lot<00:01:17.189> of<00:01:17.340> these<00:01:17.400> are<00:01:17.580> just

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
hook there again a lot of these are just

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:19.219 
hook there again a lot of these are just
preference<00:01:18.030> there's<00:01:18.780> a<00:01:18.869> little<00:01:19.110> bit<00:01:19.200> of

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:19.229 
preference there's a little bit of

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:20.780 
preference there's a little bit of
