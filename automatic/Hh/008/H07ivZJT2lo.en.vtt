00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:55.730 
camera I can lock it in so that it's not

00:00:55.730 --> 00:00:57.970 
camera I can lock it in so that it's not
going<00:00:55.970> to<00:00:56.060> move<00:00:56.210> or<00:00:56.450> fall<00:00:56.750> off<00:00:56.960> if<00:00:57.140> I<00:00:57.290> move<00:00:57.710> the

00:00:57.970 --> 00:00:57.980 
going to move or fall off if I move the

going to move or fall off if I move the
camera<00:00:58.550> around<00:00:59.380> also<00:01:00.380> is<00:01:00.800> our<00:01:01.010> little<00:01:01.250> remote

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:02.180 
camera around also is our little remote

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:05.020 
camera around also is our little remote
control<00:01:02.540> which<00:01:03.079> will<00:01:03.290> send<00:01:03.560> a<00:01:03.620> signal<00:01:03.770> to<00:01:04.159> the

00:01:05.020 --> 00:01:05.030 
control which will send a signal to the

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:07.359 
control which will send a signal to the
receiver<00:01:05.089> up<00:01:05.479> here<00:01:05.659> to<00:01:06.290> release<00:01:06.890> the<00:01:07.159> shutter

00:01:07.359 --> 00:01:07.369 
receiver up here to release the shutter

00:01:07.369 --> 00:01:08.920 
receiver up here to release the shutter
but<00:01:07.729> that<00:01:07.880> one<00:01:08.000> happened<00:01:08.270> until<00:01:08.450> I<00:01:08.509> plugged<00:01:08.810> in

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:08.930 
but that one happened until I plugged in

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:10.240 
but that one happened until I plugged in
this<00:01:09.079> cable<00:01:09.259> so<00:01:09.590> I'm<00:01:09.680> going<00:01:09.799> to<00:01:09.890> do<00:01:09.950> that<00:01:10.100> now

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:10.250 
this cable so I'm going to do that now

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:15.609 
this cable so I'm going to do that now
so<00:01:11.889> a<00:01:12.889> little<00:01:13.249> 3.5<00:01:13.609> mm<00:01:14.179> jack<00:01:14.359> goes<00:01:15.229> in<00:01:15.380> the<00:01:15.439> side

00:01:15.609 --> 00:01:15.619 
so a little 3.5 mm jack goes in the side

00:01:15.619 --> 00:01:19.029 
so a little 3.5 mm jack goes in the side
of<00:01:15.770> the<00:01:15.859> receiver<00:01:16.249> and<00:01:16.340> then<00:01:17.090> for<00:01:18.020> this<00:01:18.829> model

00:01:19.029 --> 00:01:19.039 
of the receiver and then for this model

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:23.260 
of the receiver and then for this model
camera<00:01:19.539> this<00:01:20.539> plug<00:01:20.810> plugs<00:01:21.139> into<00:01:21.380> the<00:01:21.679> GPS<00:01:22.270> port

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:23.270 
camera this plug plugs into the GPS port

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:25.359 
camera this plug plugs into the GPS port
in<00:01:23.719> the<00:01:24.350> side<00:01:24.560> here<00:01:24.740> so<00:01:24.799> I'm<00:01:25.069> just<00:01:25.100> going<00:01:25.310> to

00:01:25.359 --> 00:01:25.369 
in the side here so I'm just going to

00:01:25.369 --> 00:01:27.669 
in the side here so I'm just going to
push<00:01:25.729> that<00:01:25.759> in<00:01:26.060> you<00:01:26.719> need<00:01:26.869> to<00:01:26.899> push<00:01:27.469> it<00:01:27.590> in

00:01:27.669 --> 00:01:27.679 
push that in you need to push it in

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:31.629 
push that in you need to push it in
quite<00:01:27.950> firmly<00:01:29.020> make<00:01:30.020> sure<00:01:30.200> it's<00:01:30.319> in<00:01:30.439> and<00:01:31.340> then

quite firmly make sure it's in and then

00:01:31.639 --> 00:01:33.249 
quite firmly make sure it's in and then
I'm<00:01:31.729> just<00:01:31.789> going<00:01:32.030> to<00:01:32.060> turn<00:01:32.270> on<00:01:32.329> the<00:01:32.630> receiver

00:01:33.249 --> 00:01:33.259 
I'm just going to turn on the receiver

00:01:33.259 --> 00:01:38.080 
I'm just going to turn on the receiver
and<00:01:34.299> the<00:01:35.299> little<00:01:35.539> red<00:01:35.689> light<00:01:35.899> on<00:01:35.929> the<00:01:36.139> top<00:01:37.090> is

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:38.090 
and the little red light on the top is

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:40.080 
and the little red light on the top is
now<00:01:38.270> beeping<00:01:38.899> to<00:01:39.020> say<00:01:39.139> that<00:01:39.289> it's<00:01:39.409> receiving

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:40.090 
now beeping to say that it's receiving

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:42.669 
now beeping to say that it's receiving
so<00:01:41.090> that's<00:01:41.779> pretty<00:01:42.049> much<00:01:42.139> it<00:01:42.259> when<00:01:42.499> it<00:01:42.590> comes

00:01:42.669 --> 00:01:42.679 
so that's pretty much it when it comes

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:45.239 
so that's pretty much it when it comes
to<00:01:42.889> setting<00:01:43.159> it<00:01:43.249> up<00:01:43.369> and<00:01:43.609> now<00:01:44.299> we<00:01:44.569> can<00:01:44.779> start

00:01:45.239 --> 00:01:45.249 
to setting it up and now we can start

00:01:45.249 --> 00:01:47.830 
to setting it up and now we can start
taking<00:01:46.249> some<00:01:46.549> shots<00:01:46.700> so<00:01:47.060> I'll<00:01:47.630> just<00:01:47.749> quickly
