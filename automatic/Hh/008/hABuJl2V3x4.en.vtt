00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:32.400 
bit more tricky because it requires you

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:34.760 
bit more tricky because it requires you
changing<00:01:32.939> the<00:01:33.509> system<00:01:33.900> file<00:01:34.140> on<00:01:34.350> your<00:01:34.530> phone

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770 
changing the system file on your phone

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:36.920 
changing the system file on your phone
now<00:01:35.579> there's<00:01:35.820> two<00:01:35.970> possible<00:01:36.390> occasions<00:01:36.810> where

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930 
now there's two possible occasions where

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:38.600 
now there's two possible occasions where
it<00:01:37.020> can<00:01:37.140> be<00:01:37.259> a<00:01:37.290> and<00:01:37.619> because<00:01:37.799> of<00:01:38.040> that<00:01:38.189> there's

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610 
it can be a and because of that there's

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:40.069 
it can be a and because of that there's
two<00:01:38.850> different<00:01:39.000> files<00:01:39.479> that<00:01:39.630> you'll<00:01:39.810> need<00:01:39.960> to

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:40.079 
two different files that you'll need to

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:41.719 
two different files that you'll need to
download<00:01:40.229> in<00:01:40.560> order<00:01:40.740> to<00:01:40.860> make<00:01:41.040> sure<00:01:41.280> that<00:01:41.520> the

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:41.729 
download in order to make sure that the

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:44.300 
download in order to make sure that the
boot<00:01:41.909> animation<00:01:42.450> changes<00:01:42.930> so<00:01:43.799> because<00:01:44.159> of

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310 
boot animation changes so because of

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:46.399 
boot animation changes so because of
that<00:01:44.340> there<00:01:45.149> is<00:01:45.479> going<00:01:45.630> to<00:01:45.689> be<00:01:45.750> two<00:01:45.990> links<00:01:46.320> in

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:46.409 
that there is going to be two links in

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:48.530 
that there is going to be two links in
the<00:01:46.680> full<00:01:46.920> tutorial<00:01:47.189> in<00:01:47.729> the<00:01:47.850> description<00:01:47.880> so

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:48.540 
the full tutorial in the description so

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:50.270 
the full tutorial in the description so
be<00:01:48.570> sure<00:01:48.689> to<00:01:48.840> check<00:01:49.140> those<00:01:49.320> out<00:01:49.530> and<00:01:49.710> download

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280 
be sure to check those out and download

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:53.120 
be sure to check those out and download

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130 
them both so there's gonna be an HTC One

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:55.429 
them both so there's gonna be an HTC One
boot<00:01:53.369> and<00:01:53.579> then<00:01:54.180> put<00:01:54.479> animation<00:01:55.049> guides<00:01:55.259> if

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:55.439 
boot and then put animation guides if

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:56.990 
boot and then put animation guides if
it's<00:01:55.619> wrong<00:01:55.829> so<00:01:56.040> go<00:01:56.189> ahead<00:01:56.280> and<00:01:56.490> download<00:01:56.610> both
