00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:28.770
 to play good hockey 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:59.840
 and now we are going to ride on 

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:59.840
 the craziest Russian attraction 

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:12.830
 for 8 keygen for me never 

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:15.530
 there was a choice between boxing or 

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:18.800
 hockey i remember myself childhood i 

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:20.690
 engaged in both sports boxing 

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:23.360
 yes he was useful for thirteen years 

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:26.120
 fourteen when much carried away by this 

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:28.070
 the sport often trained I remember 

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:31.070
 myself from 3 years old when I first became 

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:33.410
 skates from then okay this is part of my 

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:37.130
 life and boxing and as much as 

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:39.500
 hobbies as for my partners 

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:42.260
 link then their level of skill is just 

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:44.330
 it is certain that the charter that maxims possess 

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:47.990
 incredible sense of hockey 

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:50.209
 they are gorgeous they give up slaughter everything 

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:52.220
 I need to do this only to open in 

00:02:50.209 --> 00:02:55.250
 time to give the transfer to create them 

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:57.170
 moments go to the gate and score goals 

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:59.540
 together with them celebrate with them 

00:02:57.170 --> 00:03:00.490
 so I am very excited and 

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:05.570
 anticipation 

00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:07.420
 big game with such masters i'm not 

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:10.580
 I think that there will be big problems with 

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:11.780
 I have already played in large venues 

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:14.750
 on such and 

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:17.239
 touch i imagine what style what 

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:18.769
 the manner I have to play of course will appear 

00:03:17.239 --> 00:03:21.290
 more free thinking time 

00:03:18.769 --> 00:03:23.480
 more space but with such 

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:25.700
 partners like my link, I think 

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:28.880
 we will enjoy the game and 

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:31.630
 I'm adapting quickly and will be fine 

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:31.630
 to interact 

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:48.400

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:53.080
 professional when he did not change 

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:54.730
 I always brought good luck 

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:56.440
 that the tractor manual allowed me 

00:03:54.730 --> 00:03:57.940
 choose the same number that was 

00:03:56.440 --> 00:04:03.430
 me over the past ten years 

00:03:57.940 --> 00:04:05.620

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:09.040
