sound PC wired headset now if you're
wondering<00:00:10.620> about<00:00:11.099> the<00:00:11.400> audio<00:00:11.790> I'm<00:00:12.059> actually

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:12.240 
wondering about the audio I'm actually

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:14.690 
wondering about the audio I'm actually
using<00:00:12.570> the<00:00:12.780> microphone<00:00:13.259> that<00:00:13.950> comes<00:00:14.340> with<00:00:14.580> the

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:14.700 
using the microphone that comes with the

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:16.550 
using the microphone that comes with the
headset<00:00:15.120> and<00:00:15.299> I<00:00:15.690> think<00:00:15.900> it<00:00:15.990> sounds<00:00:16.289> absolutely

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:16.560 
headset and I think it sounds absolutely

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:19.070 
headset and I think it sounds absolutely
fantastic<00:00:16.890> for<00:00:17.699> what<00:00:17.820> this<00:00:17.940> is<00:00:18.119> guys<00:00:18.510> anyway

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:19.080 
fantastic for what this is guys anyway

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:21.320 
fantastic for what this is guys anyway
guys<00:00:19.230> let's<00:00:19.590> get<00:00:19.800> into<00:00:19.980> the<00:00:20.220> review<00:00:20.580> so<00:00:21.000> these

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:21.330 
guys let's get into the review so these

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:24.050 
guys let's get into the review so these
are<00:00:21.660> the<00:00:21.689> wired<00:00:22.320> version<00:00:23.010> I<00:00:23.160> do<00:00:23.430> believe<00:00:23.730> there

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:24.060 
are the wired version I do believe there

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:25.939 
are the wired version I do believe there
is<00:00:24.180> a<00:00:24.210> wireless<00:00:24.570> Bluetooth<00:00:25.140> option<00:00:25.320> as<00:00:25.890> well

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:25.949 
is a wireless Bluetooth option as well

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:29.419 
is a wireless Bluetooth option as well
so<00:00:26.760> in<00:00:27.029> this<00:00:27.210> headset<00:00:27.689> we<00:00:27.869> can<00:00:28.050> experience<00:00:28.470> 7.1

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:29.429 
so in this headset we can experience 7.1

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:31.939 
so in this headset we can experience 7.1
surround<00:00:29.880> sound<00:00:30.359> it<00:00:31.230> uses<00:00:31.439> something<00:00:31.769> called

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:31.949 
surround sound it uses something called

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:35.030 
surround sound it uses something called
3d<00:00:32.610> positional<00:00:33.450> accuracy<00:00:33.899> and<00:00:34.380> the

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:35.040 
3d positional accuracy and the

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:38.000 
3d positional accuracy and the
simulation<00:00:35.760> of<00:00:35.790> seven<00:00:36.510> speakers<00:00:36.870> and<00:00:37.260> a

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:38.010 
simulation of seven speakers and a

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:40.910 
simulation of seven speakers and a
subwoofer<00:00:38.149> so<00:00:39.149> that<00:00:39.540> all<00:00:39.780> sounds<00:00:40.200> pretty<00:00:40.230> cool

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920 
subwoofer so that all sounds pretty cool

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:43.580 
subwoofer so that all sounds pretty cool

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
product has a really nice design in my

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:56.270 
product has a really nice design in my
opinion<00:00:53.969> the<00:00:54.360> really<00:00:55.020> chunky<00:00:55.289> and<00:00:55.590> the<00:00:55.949> build

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
opinion the really chunky and the build

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:58.549 
opinion the really chunky and the build
quality<00:00:56.489> is<00:00:56.789> really<00:00:57.059> good<00:00:57.510> even<00:00:58.350> though<00:00:58.440> it's

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
quality is really good even though it's

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:00.229 
quality is really good even though it's
kind<00:00:58.680> of<00:00:58.829> made<00:00:59.010> from<00:00:59.219> this<00:00:59.340> rubbery<00:00:59.879> plastic

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
kind of made from this rubbery plastic

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:02.869 
kind of made from this rubbery plastic
it<00:01:01.079> works<00:01:01.350> very<00:01:01.649> well<00:01:01.770> I<00:01:02.219> happen<00:01:02.489> to<00:01:02.670> really

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879 
it works very well I happen to really

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:05.660 
it works very well I happen to really
like<00:01:03.210> the<00:01:03.480> Nemesis<00:01:04.110> branding<00:01:04.680> as<00:01:04.799> well<00:01:05.010> but<00:01:05.640> I

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 
like the Nemesis branding as well but I

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:08.120 
like the Nemesis branding as well but I
noticed<00:01:06.060> on<00:01:06.240> one<00:01:06.659> of<00:01:06.900> the<00:01:07.080> ear<00:01:07.320> cups<00:01:07.650> I<00:01:07.890> think

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
noticed on one of the ear cups I think

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:10.340 
noticed on one of the ear cups I think
it's<00:01:08.250> the<00:01:08.400> right<00:01:08.580> one<00:01:08.850> but<00:01:09.330> it's<00:01:09.540> just<00:01:09.900> not<00:01:09.960> as

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
it's the right one but it's just not as

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:12.890 
it's the right one but it's just not as
bright<00:01:10.650> as<00:01:10.890> the<00:01:11.340> left<00:01:11.700> earcup<00:01:12.090> the<00:01:12.630> soft

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
bright as the left earcup the soft

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:14.840 
bright as the left earcup the soft
padding<00:01:13.380> really<00:01:13.860> does<00:01:14.070> make<00:01:14.340> a<00:01:14.400> difference

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
padding really does make a difference

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:17.240 
padding really does make a difference
you're<00:01:15.600> actually<00:01:15.780> very<00:01:16.290> comfortable<00:01:16.590> to<00:01:17.040> wear

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
you're actually very comfortable to wear

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:19.850 
you're actually very comfortable to wear
even<00:01:17.939> on<00:01:18.060> my<00:01:18.270> fat<00:01:18.630> head<00:01:18.840> the<00:01:19.229> padding<00:01:19.619> on<00:01:19.799> the

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
even on my fat head the padding on the

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:22.969 
even on my fat head the padding on the
earcups<00:01:20.520> isn't<00:01:21.150> the<00:01:21.270> softest<00:01:21.780> guys<00:01:21.990> but<00:01:22.439> it

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
earcups isn't the softest guys but it

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:24.170 
earcups isn't the softest guys but it
doesn't<00:01:23.310> really<00:01:23.369> make<00:01:23.580> a<00:01:23.640> difference<00:01:23.909> because

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
doesn't really make a difference because

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:26.300 
doesn't really make a difference because
they're<00:01:24.540> still<00:01:24.780> comfortable<00:01:25.380> around<00:01:26.040> my<00:01:26.280> ears

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
they're still comfortable around my ears

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:28.789 
they're still comfortable around my ears
and<00:01:26.820> even<00:01:27.150> after<00:01:27.659> having<00:01:27.780> this<00:01:28.080> headset<00:01:28.590> on

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:28.799 
and even after having this headset on

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:31.550 
and even after having this headset on
for<00:01:29.130> a<00:01:29.159> few<00:01:29.579> hours<00:01:29.790> it<00:01:30.750> still<00:01:31.079> wasn't<00:01:31.259> that

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
for a few hours it still wasn't that

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:33.620 
for a few hours it still wasn't that
uncomfortable<00:01:32.100> guys<00:01:32.520> obviously<00:01:33.450> you're

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
uncomfortable guys obviously you're

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:34.880 
uncomfortable guys obviously you're
still<00:01:33.869> aware<00:01:34.079> that<00:01:34.320> you've<00:01:34.439> got<00:01:34.590> a<00:01:34.619> massive

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890 
still aware that you've got a massive

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:37.219 
still aware that you've got a massive
headset<00:01:35.430> on<00:01:35.579> but<00:01:35.909> it<00:01:36.509> wasn't<00:01:36.869> really<00:01:36.930> that

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229 
headset on but it wasn't really that

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:40.190 
headset on but it wasn't really that
uncomfortable<00:01:37.860> at<00:01:38.280> all<00:01:38.579> so<00:01:39.060> moving<00:01:39.720> on<00:01:39.900> to<00:01:40.170> the

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 
uncomfortable at all so moving on to the

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:42.620 
uncomfortable at all so moving on to the
microphone<00:01:40.710> guys<00:01:40.979> you've<00:01:41.759> been<00:01:41.790> listening<00:01:42.150> to

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:45.299 
it up until this point anyway I think it

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:47.990 
it up until this point anyway I think it
sounds<00:01:45.479> absolutely<00:01:46.079> fantastic<00:01:46.530> and<00:01:47.460> it's

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250 
absolutely great having that freedom and

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:52.310 
absolutely great having that freedom and
of<00:01:50.460> course<00:01:50.670> it's<00:01:50.909> really<00:01:51.299> handy<00:01:51.479> being<00:01:51.899> able

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:52.320 
of course it's really handy being able
