00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:09.990 
this is the Vexilar pro pack FL 22 HD

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:12.709 
this is the Vexilar pro pack FL 22 HD
the<00:00:10.740> term<00:00:10.980> pro<00:00:11.280> pack<00:00:11.550> describes<00:00:12.090> the<00:00:12.420> case

00:00:12.709 --> 00:00:12.719 
the term pro pack describes the case

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:15.110 
the term pro pack describes the case
that<00:00:12.960> the<00:00:13.110> FL<00:00:13.380> 22<00:00:13.889> is<00:00:14.040> mounted<00:00:14.429> into<00:00:14.549> so<00:00:15.089> let's

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:15.120 
that the FL 22 is mounted into so let's

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:17.090 
that the FL 22 is mounted into so let's
talk<00:00:15.450> about<00:00:15.509> what<00:00:15.900> makes<00:00:16.139> the<00:00:16.350> pro<00:00:16.590> pack<00:00:16.830> case

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:17.100 
talk about what makes the pro pack case

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:19.970 
talk about what makes the pro pack case
so<00:00:17.340> very<00:00:17.550> special<00:00:18.029> it<00:00:18.690> starts<00:00:19.170> off<00:00:19.350> with<00:00:19.619> the

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030 
22 now the FL 22 is a very special unit

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:41.090 
22 now the FL 22 is a very special unit
it's<00:01:39.270> the<00:01:39.329> only<00:01:39.600> type<00:01:40.079> of<00:01:40.259> sonar<00:01:40.470> system<00:01:40.950> like

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.100 
it's the only type of sonar system like

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:43.819 
it's the only type of sonar system like
it<00:01:41.250> in<00:01:41.430> the<00:01:41.610> world<00:01:42.000> because<00:01:42.899> it<00:01:43.110> is<00:01:43.259> not<00:01:43.530> only<00:01:43.680> a

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:43.829 
it in the world because it is not only a

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:45.800 
it in the world because it is not only a
flat<00:01:44.189> screen<00:01:44.549> display<00:01:44.939> which<00:01:45.180> is<00:01:45.360> very<00:01:45.570> cool

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810 
flat screen display which is very cool

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:46.940 
flat screen display which is very cool
and<00:01:45.869> all<00:01:46.110> that<00:01:46.290> kind<00:01:46.470> of<00:01:46.560> stuff

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:46.950 
and all that kind of stuff

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:50.270 
and all that kind of stuff
but<00:01:47.340> it<00:01:47.430> has<00:01:47.670> only<00:01:48.060> it<00:01:49.049> has<00:01:49.290> it<00:01:49.590> has<00:01:49.649> the<00:01:50.040> range

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280 
but it has only it has it has the range

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:52.850 
but it has only it has it has the range
of<00:01:50.490> only<00:01:50.759> 60<00:01:51.360> feet<00:01:51.600> so<00:01:52.200> if<00:01:52.320> you're<00:01:52.439> looking<00:01:52.530> for

the<00:02:26.790> FL<00:02:27.150> 22<00:02:27.690> HD<00:02:28.170> does<00:02:28.470> for<00:02:29.099> target<00:02:29.550> ID<00:02:29.849> and<00:02:30.300> it's

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:30.870 
the FL 22 HD does for target ID and it's

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:32.780 
the FL 22 HD does for target ID and it's
really<00:02:31.140> truly<00:02:31.410> amazing<00:02:31.620> but<00:02:32.400> it<00:02:32.610> has

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:32.790 
really truly amazing but it has

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:34.850 
really truly amazing but it has
limitations<00:02:33.300> because<00:02:33.810> it<00:02:33.959> only<00:02:34.050> has<00:02:34.380> ranges

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:34.860 
limitations because it only has ranges

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:37.190 
limitations because it only has ranges
down<00:02:35.010> to<00:02:35.280> 60<00:02:35.910> feet<00:02:36.090> to<00:02:36.269> give<00:02:36.420> you<00:02:36.510> the<00:02:36.660> shallow

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:37.200 
down to 60 feet to give you the shallow

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:39.589 
down to 60 feet to give you the shallow
range<00:02:37.680> but<00:02:38.069> increased<00:02:38.730> resolution<00:02:39.480> and

00:02:39.589 --> 00:02:39.599 
range but increased resolution and

00:02:39.599 --> 00:02:42.410 
range but increased resolution and
that's<00:02:39.720> a<00:02:39.810> very<00:02:39.959> big<00:02:40.200> thing<00:02:40.440> the<00:02:41.160> 22<00:02:41.880> has<00:02:42.120> many

two zooms owns a six foot and a 12 foot

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:49.970 
two zooms owns a six foot and a 12 foot
what<00:02:48.120> do<00:02:48.180> they<00:02:48.299> do<00:02:48.360> quite<00:02:49.170> simply<00:02:49.560> they<00:02:49.709> allow

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:49.980 
what do they do quite simply they allow

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:52.250 
what do they do quite simply they allow
you<00:02:50.040> to<00:02:50.250> zoom<00:02:50.280> in<00:02:50.940> on<00:02:51.120> just<00:02:51.150> the<00:02:51.540> bottom<00:02:51.959> six

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:52.260 
you to zoom in on just the bottom six

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:54.229 
you to zoom in on just the bottom six
foot<00:02:52.500> of<00:02:52.590> the<00:02:52.650> water<00:02:52.860> column<00:02:53.250> so<00:02:53.459> say<00:02:54.060> you're

00:02:54.229 --> 00:02:54.239 
foot of the water column so say you're

00:02:54.239 --> 00:02:56.180 
foot of the water column so say you're
fishing<00:02:54.600> in<00:02:54.660> sixty<00:02:55.110> foot<00:02:55.260> of<00:02:55.410> water<00:02:55.590> if<00:02:55.890> you

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:56.190 
fishing in sixty foot of water if you

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:58.640 
fishing in sixty foot of water if you
switch<00:02:56.549> to<00:02:56.580> the<00:02:56.790> six<00:02:57.150> foot<00:02:57.360> auto<00:02:57.660> zoom<00:02:58.110> mode<00:02:58.349> it

00:02:58.640 --> 00:02:58.650 
switch to the six foot auto zoom mode it

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:01.550 
switch to the six foot auto zoom mode it
zooms<00:02:59.310> it<00:02:59.489> on<00:02:59.580> the<00:02:59.670> bottom<00:03:00.000> six<00:03:00.330> foot<00:03:00.599> just<00:03:01.440> as

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:01.560 
zooms it on the bottom six foot just as

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:03.380 
zooms it on the bottom six foot just as
if<00:03:01.739> you<00:03:01.890> were<00:03:02.010> fishing<00:03:02.310> in<00:03:02.580> six<00:03:02.910> foot<00:03:03.090> of<00:03:03.209> water

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:03.390 
if you were fishing in six foot of water

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:06.110 
if you were fishing in six foot of water
so<00:03:03.900> the<00:03:04.049> resolution<00:03:04.410> in<00:03:04.860> 64<00:03:05.459> to<00:03:05.549> water<00:03:05.790> has

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:06.120 
so the resolution in 64 to water has

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:09.199 
so the resolution in 64 to water has
never<00:03:06.630> ever<00:03:06.930> been<00:03:07.290> better<00:03:07.650> so<00:03:08.400> you<00:03:08.849> can<00:03:09.000> do<00:03:09.090> it

00:03:09.199 --> 00:03:09.209 
never ever been better so you can do it

00:03:09.209 --> 00:03:11.780 
never ever been better so you can do it
in<00:03:09.299> a<00:03:09.420> six<00:03:09.630> foot<00:03:09.870> or<00:03:10.080> the<00:03:10.860> 12<00:03:11.130> foot<00:03:11.310> zoom<00:03:11.519> zones

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:11.790 
in a six foot or the 12 foot zoom zones

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:13.789 
in a six foot or the 12 foot zoom zones
you<00:03:11.910> have<00:03:12.030> two<00:03:12.209> of<00:03:12.360> them<00:03:12.450> it<00:03:12.959> has<00:03:13.110> a<00:03:13.140> low<00:03:13.530> power

00:03:13.789 --> 00:03:13.799 
you have two of them it has a low power

00:03:13.799 --> 00:03:15.979 
you have two of them it has a low power
mode<00:03:14.130> for<00:03:14.430> shallow<00:03:14.670> water<00:03:14.819> applications<00:03:15.750> it
