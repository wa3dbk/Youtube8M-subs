00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:10.889
 because it's my people coming closer 

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:12.990
 once the New Year and among all 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:14.910
 those stupid superstitions of that time 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:17.070
 Lentil of the year could not miss the 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:19.680
 luck is a supper we will prepare a 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:21.180
 Today's special lentil recipe does not 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:22.920
 because she gives money or nothing 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:23.939
 You just want something hot, I 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:25.560
 I think it should be done in 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:28.980
 other meals during the year and not only 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:30.599
 in the new one or I think beans won 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:32.730
 people because it 's the best 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:33.840
 in the oldest is to give money yes 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:35.730
 lines for who produces and for whom 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:37.950
 sells because if there was no such legend 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:40.230
 of the lentil money forwards 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:42.780
 bravery to do at home and people 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:44.850
 in my business profit is who produces and 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:47.030
 who to sell before this time of year you 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:50.010
 will have money for them 

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:51.840
 this recipe carry in two steps 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:54.000
 I will do from the lie and my 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:56.879
 brother will be part of the pumpkin part 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:01:00.480
 of the lentil we are going to use salame ap with 

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:02.460
 garlic onion and of course plus aunt without a 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:05.280
 lentil you can not do school 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:07.400
 and last but not least salt 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:07.400
 August 

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:14.830
 now he's going to put the bacon in there 

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:16.390
 of the pan but rather put fat 

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:21.060
 none because the bacon will drop 

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:21.060
 own fat for him if he stays alone 

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:32.890
 now we will put the onion and the 

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:32.890
 garlic 

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:42.340
 now that everything is over, it will put 

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:42.340
 the salami 

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:51.640
 now we add water 

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:57.880
 soon after we had something 

00:01:55.900 --> 00:02:01.170
 very important and then said that you 

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:01.170
 have to wash the lentils 

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:08.239
 if you want to give a special taste with 

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:12.650
 your lentil you can put one 

00:02:08.239 --> 00:02:14.330
 only laurel leaf to the euro we put 

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:16.459
 a little salt and let it cook 

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:19.780
 feel more or less about 40 

00:02:16.459 --> 00:02:19.780
 minutes on high heat 

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:25.909
 while andrÃ© finishing of kitchen 

00:02:23.689 --> 00:02:27.829
 ancient, I'm going to prepare our 

00:02:25.909 --> 00:02:30.170
 work that will serve as recipients of 

00:02:27.829 --> 00:02:32.360
 serving it fits cooler in our supper 

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:33.890
 is to decorate the work we are going to use a 

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:35.510
 technique that has been shown here in 

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:38.920

00:02:39.319 --> 00:02:43.849
 good to do we 'll still need the 

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:46.099
 grandmother to a lot of paper some 

00:02:43.849 --> 00:02:47.689
 suffering and of course a knife 

00:02:46.099 --> 00:02:49.250
 the first thing you will do then I 

00:02:47.689 --> 00:02:52.329
 I'll use a pot to score. 

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:52.329
 top of the ball 

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:59.569
 and now it's already marked and I'm going 

00:02:56.420 --> 00:03:01.310
 put here the legal paper mold 

00:02:59.569 --> 00:03:03.200
 if you do not want to take the trouble to do the 

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:05.299
 mold at home you can access why 

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:07.310

00:03:05.299 --> 00:03:09.700
 video our facebook and go with it 

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:09.700

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:43.959
 the movie is ready here pumpkin I sweated 

00:03:41.739 --> 00:03:46.180
 cutting peeling it but I think 

00:03:43.959 --> 00:03:48.370
 It was more or less how a return here is the 

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:50.500
 first time that I listen to a 

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:52.090
 work had more experience and watermelon is 

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:56.500
 the most difficult work 

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:58.269
 I think it's cool and now just get in 

00:03:56.500 --> 00:04:00.840
 ti ti is ready to put here was 

00:03:58.269 --> 00:04:00.840
 easy prey 

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:09.379
 This one was our recipe. 

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:11.689

 Of course we're not doing here. 

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:17.479
 because it gives luck something of the sort 

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:19.070
 if you want you can even pick up and sell 

00:04:17.479 --> 00:04:20.209
 this dish so expect to make money 

00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:23.240
 brand new 

00:04:20.209 --> 00:04:25.850
 agile and 7 and the good on the ball you need 

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:27.740
 wash it then it 's exactly the whole 

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:29.840
 the service you have to carve and she 

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:31.970
 is to do politics because they are not washing 

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:35.690
 panela at least in that rafael 

00:04:31.970 --> 00:04:38.990
 again a bossy way 

00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:42.639

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:42.639
 big hug and see you 

00:04:44.139 --> 00:04:49.000

00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:49.000
 assumption 

00:05:01.340 --> 00:05:07.820
 now that everything has already affected you, 

00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:11.380
