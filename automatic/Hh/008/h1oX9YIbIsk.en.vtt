around 50 Friday the thickness values

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:18.710 
around 50 Friday the thickness values
drop<00:02:17.310> even<00:02:17.490> more<00:02:17.670> a<00:02:17.880> good<00:02:18.150> chance<00:02:18.420> we<00:02:18.569> won't

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:18.720 
drop even more a good chance we won't

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:20.870

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:20.880 
get out of the 40s and look at the snow

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:22.880 
get out of the 40s and look at the snow

over<00:02:23.099> Tennessee<00:02:23.489> and<00:02:23.610> Kentucky<00:02:23.760> and<00:02:24.750> some<00:02:25.020> of

over Tennessee and Kentucky and some of

those can easily creeped in here Friday

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.140 
those can easily creeped in here Friday
night<00:02:27.770> so<00:02:28.770> that's<00:02:28.950> when<00:02:29.220> the<00:02:29.370> chance<00:02:29.700> of<00:02:29.910> snow

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:30.150 
night so that's when the chance of snow

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:34.220 
night so that's when the chance of snow
showers<00:02:30.180> will<00:02:30.660> begin<00:02:31.580> and<00:02:32.959> there<00:02:33.959> might<00:02:34.080> be<00:02:34.110> a

big upper trough is rotating through
here<00:02:46.080> and<00:02:46.260> we've<00:02:46.800> seen<00:02:47.069> you<00:02:47.310> know<00:02:47.430> each<00:02:47.550> run

here and we've seen you know each run

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:49.160 
here and we've seen you know each run
looks<00:02:48.000> a<00:02:48.090> little<00:02:48.239> different<00:02:48.450> this<00:02:48.750> one<00:02:48.959> is<00:02:49.050> not

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:49.170 
looks a little different this one is not

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:51.350 
looks a little different this one is not
quite<00:02:49.530> as<00:02:49.590> cold<00:02:50.040> aloft<00:02:50.459> as<00:02:50.640> others<00:02:50.910> but<00:02:50.940> still

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:51.360 
quite as cold aloft as others but still

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:53.840 
quite as cold aloft as others but still
that<00:02:51.569> is<00:02:51.690> very<00:02:52.680> cold<00:02:52.950> air<00:02:53.160> aloft<00:02:53.250> and<00:02:53.670> down

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:53.850 
that is very cold air aloft and down

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:55.610 
that is very cold air aloft and down

squeeze<00:02:55.920> out<00:02:56.160> snow<00:02:56.459> showers<00:02:56.910> and<00:02:57.390> there<00:02:57.630> could

00:02:57.800 --> 00:02:57.810 
squeeze out snow showers and there could

00:02:57.810 --> 00:02:59.479 
squeeze out snow showers and there could
be<00:02:57.840> some<00:02:58.170> snow<00:02:58.410> flurries<00:02:58.680> down<00:02:59.069> into<00:02:59.280> South

00:02:59.479 --> 00:02:59.489 
be some snow flurries down into South

these convective snow showers it will be

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:07.160 
these convective snow showers it will be
similar<00:03:05.220> to<00:03:05.370> februari<00:03:05.970> 16th<00:03:06.600> if<00:03:06.780> you<00:03:06.870> recall

to<00:03:23.120> prattville<00:03:24.120> to<00:03:24.920> opelika<00:03:25.920> and<00:03:27.380> so<00:03:28.380> we'll

00:03:28.819 --> 00:03:28.829 
to prattville to opelika and so we'll

00:03:28.829 --> 00:03:30.500 
to prattville to opelika and so we'll
keep<00:03:29.070> an<00:03:29.190> eye<00:03:29.310> on<00:03:29.340> things<00:03:29.489> so<00:03:30.060> we'll<00:03:30.209> kind<00:03:30.450> of

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:30.510 
keep an eye on things so we'll kind of

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:32.449 
keep an eye on things so we'll kind of
say<00:03:30.690> maybe<00:03:30.900> a<00:03:30.989> dusting<00:03:31.260> in<00:03:31.590> spots<00:03:31.920> maybe<00:03:32.310> a
