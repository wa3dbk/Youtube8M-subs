double from the last 40 bytes we had an

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:14.219 
double from the last 40 bytes we had an
accompanying<00:01:13.390> these<00:01:13.570> tablets<00:01:14.049> they're

00:01:14.219 --> 00:01:14.229 
accompanying these tablets they're

00:01:14.229 --> 00:01:16.020 
accompanying these tablets they're
supposed<00:01:14.530> to<00:01:14.590> be<00:01:14.710> a<00:01:14.740> new<00:01:15.100> smart<00:01:15.579> cover

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:16.030 
supposed to be a new smart cover

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:18.209 
supposed to be a new smart cover
keyboard<00:01:16.749> thing<00:01:17.020> that's<00:01:17.710> supposed<00:01:17.799> to<00:01:18.009> have

00:01:18.209 --> 00:01:18.219 
keyboard thing that's supposed to have

00:01:18.219 --> 00:01:20.190 
keyboard thing that's supposed to have
backlight<00:01:18.759> and<00:01:18.789> better<00:01:19.210> sensor<00:01:19.749> so<00:01:19.960> it's<00:01:20.079> more

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:20.200 
backlight and better sensor so it's more

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:22.380 
backlight and better sensor so it's more
accurate<00:01:20.469> and<00:01:20.920> whatnot<00:01:21.249> so<00:01:21.609> I<00:01:21.880> guess<00:01:22.090> that's<00:01:22.299> a

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:22.390 
accurate and whatnot so I guess that's a

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:23.880 
accurate and whatnot so I guess that's a
good<00:01:22.420> thing<00:01:22.749> but<00:01:23.020> anyway<00:01:23.289> if<00:01:23.439> you<00:01:23.530> want<00:01:23.710> to<00:01:23.770> get

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:23.890 
good thing but anyway if you want to get

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:25.859 
good thing but anyway if you want to get
these<00:01:24.069> surface<00:01:24.520> 2<00:01:24.789> of<00:01:24.969> these<00:01:25.119> surface<00:01:25.479> pro<00:01:25.810> 2
