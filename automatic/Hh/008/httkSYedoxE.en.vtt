00:01:10.029 --> 00:01:10.039 
this kind of impedance control here

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:13.510 
this kind of impedance control here
marked<00:01:10.759> up<00:01:10.880> with<00:01:11.060> 50<00:01:11.600> to<00:01:12.200> 50<00:01:12.560> and<00:01:12.710> 500<00:01:12.950> and<00:01:13.429> what

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:13.520 
marked up with 50 to 50 and 500 and what

marked up with 50 to 50 and 500 and what
that<00:01:13.700> gives<00:01:13.969> you<00:01:14.119> is<00:01:14.149> three<00:01:14.689> different<00:01:15.789> very

00:01:16.779 --> 00:01:16.789 
that gives you is three different very

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:19.809 
that gives you is three different very
tone<00:01:17.060> presets<00:01:17.719> so<00:01:17.960> at<00:01:18.439> 50<00:01:18.950> we're<00:01:19.520> going<00:01:19.670> to<00:01:19.729> be

00:01:19.809 --> 00:01:19.819 
tone presets so at 50 we're going to be

00:01:19.819 --> 00:01:21.550 
tone presets so at 50 we're going to be
hearing<00:01:20.119> kind<00:01:20.509> of<00:01:20.600> like<00:01:20.749> quite<00:01:20.959> low<00:01:21.229> impedance

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:21.560 
hearing kind of like quite low impedance

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:23.649 
hearing kind of like quite low impedance
so<00:01:21.950> you're<00:01:22.100> going<00:01:22.219> to<00:01:22.249> get<00:01:22.429> lots<00:01:23.359> of<00:01:23.479> that<00:01:23.630> kind

00:01:23.649 --> 00:01:23.659 
so you're going to get lots of that kind

00:01:23.659 --> 00:01:27.309 
so you're going to get lots of that kind
of<00:01:23.959> hollow<00:01:24.229> woody<00:01:24.619> sound<00:01:25.270> at<00:01:26.270> 250<00:01:26.840> it<00:01:27.049> sounds

00:01:27.309 --> 00:01:27.319 
of hollow woody sound at 250 it sounds

00:01:27.319 --> 00:01:29.020 
of hollow woody sound at 250 it sounds
like<00:01:27.409> a<00:01:27.469> P<00:01:27.679> bass<00:01:27.889> which<00:01:28.159> is<00:01:28.310> great<00:01:28.639> makes<00:01:28.909> it

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:29.030
