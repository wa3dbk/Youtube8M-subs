00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.840
 so for the accompaniment in the 

00:00:01.380 --> 00:00:05.850
 quick part there are two ways to do 

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:07.379
 you play with a bass player 

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:09.929
 and at that moment you just have to 

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:13.550
 to make the agreements a kind of covers 

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:13.550
 not you will see all 

00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:27.869
 if you are alone you do the 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:38.239
 lowers followed by the agreement be audois to 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:38.239
 pick it's up to you 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:47.560
 for the central theme here there is 

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:50.710
 a lot of difficulties I chose a 

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:52.240
 fingering on a rope that use the 

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:54.489
 fourth finger the way of a 

00:00:52.240 --> 00:01:01.330
 violinist since this piece and has been 

00:00:54.489 --> 00:01:02.530
 composed initially for the violin so 

00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:05.460
 the part that will ask you the most 

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:05.460
 job is this one here 

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:21.340
 you 

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:21.340
 that's good luck 

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:26.210
 so in the first part the part 

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:28.310
 slow as in others elsewhere 

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:32.000
 we can quite add 

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:34.400
 ornamentations to improve the phrasing 

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:40.790
 or make it more personal for example 

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:42.970
 in the score there is written we can 

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:42.970
 to play 

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:53.840
 a little further on the score but 

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:57.030
 m 

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:58.890
 here you can embroidered your way the 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:02.660
 way of gypsy musicians every 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:02.660
 passages that is of interest to you
