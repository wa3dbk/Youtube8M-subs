00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:18.680 
this griddle before so I'm trying to
figure<00:02:17.310> out<00:02:17.519> the<00:02:17.640> best<00:02:17.850> way<00:02:18.120> to<00:02:18.180> lay<00:02:18.420> it<00:02:18.480> on

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:18.690 
figure out the best way to lay it on

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:22.370 
figure out the best way to lay it on
there<00:02:18.930> I<00:02:19.079> guess<00:02:19.799> I'll<00:02:20.010> just<00:02:20.930> go<00:02:21.930> ahead<00:02:22.170> and

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:22.380 
there I guess I'll just go ahead and

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:26.170 
there I guess I'll just go ahead and
just<00:02:22.500> lay<00:02:22.769> it<00:02:22.970> on<00:02:23.970> there<00:02:24.209> just<00:02:24.390> like<00:02:24.510> that

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:26.180 
just lay it on there just like that

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:28.800 
just lay it on there just like that
and

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:28.810 
and

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:31.199 
and
I<00:02:28.920> don't<00:02:29.920> know<00:02:30.040> probably<00:02:30.490> take<00:02:30.640> about<00:02:30.760> five

00:02:31.199 --> 00:02:31.209 
I don't know probably take about five

00:02:31.209 --> 00:02:35.130 
I don't know probably take about five
minutes<00:02:31.569> to<00:02:31.780> cook<00:02:32.020> on<00:02:32.230> that<00:02:32.410> side<00:02:32.740> and<00:02:33.010> so<00:02:34.140> then

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:35.140 
minutes to cook on that side and so then

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:40.860 
minutes to cook on that side and so then
we'll<00:02:35.620> come<00:02:36.010> back<00:02:36.280> and<00:02:37.020> flip<00:02:38.020> it<00:02:39.690> okay<00:02:40.690> it's

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:40.870 
we'll come back and flip it okay it's

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:43.140 
we'll come back and flip it okay it's
been<00:02:41.020> about<00:02:41.050> five<00:02:41.500> minutes<00:02:41.890> on<00:02:42.190> that<00:02:42.430> side<00:02:42.760> the

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:43.150 
been about five minutes on that side the

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:46.380 
been about five minutes on that side the
house<00:02:43.300> is<00:02:43.569> smoking<00:02:44.110> up<00:02:44.230> pretty<00:02:44.440> bad<00:02:44.709> here<00:02:45.390> see

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:46.390 
house is smoking up pretty bad here see

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:48.870 
house is smoking up pretty bad here see
if<00:02:46.450> I<00:02:46.569> can<00:02:46.750> flip<00:02:47.020> these<00:02:47.230> without<00:02:47.530> them<00:02:47.880> coming

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:48.880 
if I can flip these without them coming

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:54.949 
if I can flip these without them coming
apart<00:02:49.180> on<00:02:49.390> me

00:02:54.949 --> 00:02:54.959 

00:02:54.959 --> 00:03:14.380 

it's<00:02:55.859> pretty<00:02:56.099> good

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:14.390 

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:16.450 

these<00:03:14.930> are<00:03:15.080> looking<00:03:15.440> good<00:03:15.710> now<00:03:16.250> I'm<00:03:16.340> gonna

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:16.460 
these are looking good now I'm gonna

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:17.830 
these are looking good now I'm gonna
season<00:03:16.730> these<00:03:17.000> a<00:03:17.060> little<00:03:17.390> more<00:03:17.570> of<00:03:17.660> a<00:03:17.750> little

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:17.840 
season these a little more of a little

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:20.050 
season these a little more of a little
bit<00:03:18.080> of<00:03:18.110> dill<00:03:18.440> weed<00:03:18.650> the<00:03:19.280> reason<00:03:19.550> I<00:03:19.610> didn't<00:03:19.880> put

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:20.060 
bit of dill weed the reason I didn't put

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:23.350 
bit of dill weed the reason I didn't put
that<00:03:20.090> on<00:03:20.240> first<00:03:20.750> is<00:03:21.110> because<00:03:21.850> if<00:03:22.850> it<00:03:22.970> gets<00:03:23.090> too

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:23.360 
that on first is because if it gets too

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:26.260 
that on first is because if it gets too
hot<00:03:23.570> it<00:03:23.750> kind<00:03:23.900> of<00:03:23.930> burns<00:03:24.260> so<00:03:24.950> let's<00:03:25.940> put<00:03:26.120> it<00:03:26.210> on

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:26.270 
hot it kind of burns so let's put it on

00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:32.890 
hot it kind of burns so let's put it on
now<00:03:28.330> all<00:03:29.330> right<00:03:29.540> a<00:03:29.570> little<00:03:29.690> bad<00:03:29.960> and<00:03:31.870> make<00:03:32.870> a

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:32.900 
now all right a little bad and make a

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:35.920 
now all right a little bad and make a
puts<00:03:33.200> a<00:03:33.380> little<00:03:33.500> bit<00:03:33.590> of<00:03:33.680> pepper<00:03:33.890> to<00:03:34.570> move<00:03:35.570> kind

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:35.930 
puts a little bit of pepper to move kind

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:39.310

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:39.320 
of what I put pepper on to tell them no

00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:43.060 
of what I put pepper on to tell them no
pepper<00:03:39.590> on<00:03:39.830> one<00:03:40.070> for<00:03:40.280> my<00:03:40.370> wife<00:03:41.770> okay<00:03:42.770> it's<00:03:42.920> been

shove<00:03:44.930> that<00:03:45.170> up<00:03:45.320> right<00:03:45.560> there<00:03:45.620> I<00:03:45.800> think

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:45.890 
shove that up right there I think

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:48.550

00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:48.560 
they're probably done cast-iron holds

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:50.410 
they're probably done cast-iron holds
they<00:03:48.680> eat<00:03:48.860> anyway<00:03:49.250> now<00:03:49.850> we'll<00:03:50.000> get<00:03:50.120> them<00:03:50.300> off

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:50.420 
they eat anyway now we'll get them off

00:03:50.420 --> 00:04:04.990 
they eat anyway now we'll get them off
of<00:03:50.450> there<00:03:50.630> and<00:03:50.930> see<00:03:51.170> how<00:03:51.230> it<00:03:51.380> look

00:04:04.990 --> 00:04:05.000 

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.210 

well<00:04:05.870> looks<00:04:06.200> like<00:04:06.440> this<00:04:06.680> turned<00:04:06.980> out<00:04:07.160> pretty

00:04:07.210 --> 00:04:07.220 
well looks like this turned out pretty

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:09.760
