00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:17.100
 today and especially for the ps vita 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:18.300
 normal since the sony conference was 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:19.439
 held this morning even in attack 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:22.050
 directly by the announced of a new 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:24.420
 version of the portable console the future 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:25.560
 Vita will be 15% lighter and 20% more 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:27.510
 fine than the current version 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:29.490
 it also offers an autonomy of 6 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:31.410
 hours against five before and 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:32.489
 will recharge via a micro usb port a 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:33.930
 more practical solution 

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:36.239
 abandoning a charging system 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:37.770
 previously specific to the console endowed 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:39.120
 an internal memory of a gigabyte 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:41.250
 console will also be able to count on 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:42.899
 memory cards up to 64 giga whose 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:44.820
 price is expected to decrease by 40% 

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:46.379
 sony must think we're still in them 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:48.780
 90s since the name of the console 

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:50.100
 will be the vita 2000 in there she will be 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:51.600
 available in several colors and will be 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:52.050
 sold around 150 euros to 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:53.520
 Japan 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:55.079
 this price decrease can be explained by 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:56.850
 part by going back on 

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:59.430
 the screen that gives up the oled solution 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:01.350
 and go back to the good old lcd and finally this 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:01.710
 model would not seem to be compatible 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:03.989
 3g 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:05.640
 it's next October 10th 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:07.560
 model will land in miyazaki country 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:08.760
 will take a little patience to 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:10.799
 get an accurate idea of ​​the quality 

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:12.479
 chosen screen we finally know that this 

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:13.830
 version will arrive with 90 days 

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:15.600
 subscription to playstation plus 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:17.070
 we take the opportunity to pull 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:19.380
 our hat to totoro dads 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:22.290
 princess mononoke and or even cherokee 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:23.490
 takes a well-deserved retirement sony did 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:24.780
 decidedly not done things by half 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:27.360
 closing his lecture today 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:29.460
 on the no of the system ps vita tv it's 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:30.540
 a real double combo breaker that 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:32.909
 could really hurt consoles 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:34.890
 bridle and make bobo at the station that's 

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:36.210
 still a shame but ps vita tv 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:37.409
 what is it is a case that 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:39.030
 will give you access to 

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:40.770
 video on demand but also 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:43.020
 playstation network or allowing to 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:45.240
 play the same psp games vita on your 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:47.310
 sony TV adds that a function 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:49.140
 remote play it will be possible for ps4 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:50.520
 in clear it would be possible to play on 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:51.630
 another TV than the one where is good at 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:53.009
 the ps4 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:54.869
 if we add to all that old games 

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:56.670
 playstation tel catalog could do 

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:58.200
 a cardboard especially that the advertised price 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:59.130
 seems very reasonable around 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:01.380
 75 euros 

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:03.540
 last point the device according to him 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:04.950
 with a memory card of 8 gigabytes if 

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:07.200
 this presentation has sold you a dream 

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:09.119
 I hope you know that the ps vita telly 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:11.110
 is expected for November 14 in Japan 

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:12.670
 for us it will probably be 

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:14.200
 more patient on the other hand the 

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:16.690
 Japanese will only touch the ps4 account 

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:18.910
 February 2014 so leave them this little 

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:20.140
 pleasure in compensation and the conference 

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:22.000
 sony it was also the opportunity for 

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:23.590
 some of the favorite editors of the 

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.240
 brand to announce upcoming titles 

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:26.710
 for ps4 and ps vita 

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:28.510
 and when we tell you that the laptop 

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:30.190
 was really the queen of the ball so we 

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:31.930
 is very serious for the ps4 while 

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:33.640
 first capcom unveiled gameplay of 

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:35.740
 deep down which in universe looks 

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:37.150
 medieval fantasy actually takes place 

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:39.459
 in a version of new york that would have 

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:41.080
 rather badly shot in 2000 94 

00:02:39.459 --> 00:02:42.580
 the studio explained that the game 

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:45.010
 will have meetings and dungeons 

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:46.510
 randomly generated a coop mode in 

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:48.790
 line can bring together up to 4 players 

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:51.280
 reckless on his side the famous studio 

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:53.530
 sega announced yesterday kusar restoration 

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:55.300

 families this new iteration of 

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:57.670
 the ishin saga will take place in Japan 

00:02:57.010 --> 00:02:59.440
 of the edo era 

00:02:57.670 --> 00:03:00.880
 unfortunately the title risks to 

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:02.950
 stay in japanese but it's a 

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:04.540
 deal to follow on ps vita finally this 

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:06.430
 are whimsical arnova and soul 

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:08.560

 for march 2014 in japan the least that 

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:17.500
 it can be said that this 

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:18.760
 sony conference was really very 

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:20.350
 rich and maybe it is not yet 

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:21.940
 finished since the tokyo game show 

00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:24.580
 approached that gameplay videos 

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:25.600
 could land without warning and the 

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:27.040

 around February 22, 2014 

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:43.989
 probably a new way for sony 

00:03:42.489 --> 00:03:45.880
 to be forgiven for this outing 

00:03:43.989 --> 00:03:47.290
