00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.710
 Hello everyone and today we will be with you 

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.859
 try to play green-eyed taxi 

00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:10.980
 boyarsky 

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:11.780
 but it wo n't be quite green eyed 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:16.080
 Taxi 

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:19.430
 so how are we going to type it something like this 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:22.529
 how would his ramstein play 

00:00:19.430 --> 00:00:28.320
 Well, let's see what of this 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:30.810
 we will turn out here I will include a blow nick from 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:33.380
 we have no taxi kick so 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:35.850
 put what is here more or less 

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:38.719
 suitable and so simple 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:38.719
 poprikalyvaemsya 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:59.120
 but 

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:04.450
 h 

00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:57.820
 but 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:00.890
 but 

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:22.620
 Well, that's about what we did 

00:02:16.459 --> 00:02:29.400
 Well, who liked I can teach so well 

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:32.510
 we play this crap like this 

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:36.870
 in the original we have it sung here and 

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:40.980
 Remained only remove tired first 

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:46.070
 the line here and stayed played like this 

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:46.070
 here we clamp a fifth 

00:02:46.489 --> 00:02:53.300
 a5 

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:58.489
 then f5 

00:02:53.300 --> 00:03:01.489
 same 5 and 

00:02:58.489 --> 00:03:01.489
 e5 

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:10.560
 and got here that's well, then it is difficult to 

00:03:07.739 --> 00:03:16.019
 explain here and when we are deaf when not 

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:19.310
 we turn off the edge here and stay 

00:03:16.019 --> 00:03:19.310
 so it will sound 

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:41.410
 just take off fatigue eos 5d 5 and 5 

00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:56.250
 and now you know how to two lines 

00:04:03.710 --> 00:04:05.740
 but 

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:22.980
 and this evening treats my soul 

00:04:19.730 --> 00:04:31.890
 It plays just like the first ones 

00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:39.590
 two lines chorus as played when we 

00:04:31.890 --> 00:04:41.660
 finished the verse there I have a soul soul 

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:46.310
 treats 

00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:46.310
 here we still sound 

00:05:15.370 --> 00:05:18.330
 they 

00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:20.360
 but 

00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:20.360
 but 

00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:22.910
 on 

00:05:29.310 --> 00:05:39.960
 and once again after the couplet we taught more 

00:05:34.830 --> 00:05:46.770
 chord e 5 and on the cord e5 we start 

00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:49.520
 Peter and then go to court again 

00:05:46.770 --> 00:05:49.520
 it turns out 

00:06:33.420 --> 00:06:38.850
 that's basically all good luck to everyone yet
