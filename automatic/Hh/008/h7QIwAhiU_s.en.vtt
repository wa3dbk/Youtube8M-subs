like one coat of this would be good like
a<00:02:16.780> really<00:02:17.080> thin<00:02:17.410> coat<00:02:17.680> I<00:02:17.890> don't<00:02:18.069> think<00:02:18.310> that

00:02:18.509 --> 00:02:18.519 
a really thin coat I don't think that

00:02:18.519 --> 00:02:20.309 
a really thin coat I don't think that
the<00:02:18.790> brush<00:02:19.030> picks<00:02:19.330> up<00:02:19.510> that<00:02:19.720> much<00:02:19.900> product

00:02:20.309 --> 00:02:20.319 
the brush picks up that much product

00:02:20.319 --> 00:02:23.339 
the brush picks up that much product
that's<00:02:21.310> why<00:02:21.640> you<00:02:21.700> don't<00:02:22.120> really<00:02:22.330> get<00:02:22.629> a<00:02:22.900> lot<00:02:23.140> of

00:02:23.339 --> 00:02:23.349 
that's why you don't really get a lot of

00:02:23.349 --> 00:02:26.759 
that's why you don't really get a lot of
volume<00:02:23.620> or<00:02:24.069> anything<00:02:24.310> like<00:02:24.580> that<00:02:24.989> but<00:02:25.989> yeah<00:02:26.379> so

00:02:26.759 --> 00:02:26.769 
volume or anything like that but yeah so

00:02:26.769 --> 00:02:28.830 
volume or anything like that but yeah so
that's<00:02:27.069> about<00:02:27.220> it<00:02:27.340> for<00:02:27.519> me<00:02:27.910> if<00:02:28.090> you<00:02:28.209> guys<00:02:28.360> want

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:28.840 
that's about it for me if you guys want

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:31.080 
that's about it for me if you guys want
to<00:02:28.930> try<00:02:29.200> it<00:02:29.260> I<00:02:29.590> definitely<00:02:29.980> say<00:02:30.459> give<00:02:30.790> it<00:02:30.819> a<00:02:30.940> go

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:31.090 
to try it I definitely say give it a go

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:32.460 
to try it I definitely say give it a go
it's<00:02:31.360> really<00:02:31.599> really<00:02:31.780> good<00:02:31.959> at<00:02:32.049> lengthening

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:32.470 
it's really really good at lengthening

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:34.050 
it's really really good at lengthening
so<00:02:32.620> if<00:02:32.709> you<00:02:32.829> have<00:02:32.950> short<00:02:33.190> lashes<00:02:33.400> this<00:02:33.849> might

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:34.060 
so if you have short lashes this might

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:37.440 
so if you have short lashes this might
work<00:02:34.180> for<00:02:34.239> you<00:02:34.660> or<00:02:34.959> maybe<00:02:35.590> the<00:02:36.450> waterproof

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:37.450 
work for you or maybe the waterproof

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:40.890 
work for you or maybe the waterproof
version<00:02:37.660> is<00:02:38.049> better<00:02:38.370> but<00:02:39.370> so<00:02:40.150> that's<00:02:40.540> about<00:02:40.780> it

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:40.900 
version is better but so that's about it

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:43.979 
version is better but so that's about it
