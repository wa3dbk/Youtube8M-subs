00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:13.030 
getting rid of them isn't going to be

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:14.340 
getting rid of them isn't going to be
that<00:03:13.060> easy<00:03:13.210> and<00:03:13.630> that's<00:03:13.750> what<00:03:13.930> I<00:03:13.960> got<00:03:14.200> that's

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:14.350 
that easy and that's what I got that's

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:15.570 
that easy and that's what I got that's
the<00:03:14.470> story<00:03:14.770> they're<00:03:14.920> trying<00:03:15.100> to<00:03:15.190> tell<00:03:15.340> and

the story they're trying to tell and

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:17.310 
the story they're trying to tell and
they're<00:03:16.000> doing<00:03:16.150> a<00:03:16.300> damn<00:03:16.450> good<00:03:16.480> job<00:03:16.690> telling<00:03:17.050> it

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:17.320 
they're doing a damn good job telling it

00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:19.860 
they're doing a damn good job telling it
and<00:03:17.850> I'm<00:03:18.850> looking<00:03:19.240> forward<00:03:19.480> to<00:03:19.600> the<00:03:19.690> match

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:19.870

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:27.640 
see Brock win because I don't think Punk

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:29.970

needs<00:03:27.940> to<00:03:28.150> win<00:03:28.330> that<00:03:28.540> bad<00:03:28.900> but<00:03:29.440> then<00:03:29.680> again<00:03:29.709> I

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:29.980 
needs to win that bad but then again I

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:31.740 
needs to win that bad but then again I
think<00:03:30.250> he<00:03:30.340> will<00:03:30.520> end<00:03:30.700> up<00:03:30.820> winning<00:03:31.000> because<00:03:31.209> for

think he will end up winning because for
me<00:03:31.930> I'm<00:03:32.140> looking<00:03:32.290> further<00:03:33.010> into<00:03:33.190> the<00:03:33.520> future

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:33.640

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:35.280 
me I'm looking further into the future
i'm<00:03:33.910> looking<00:03:34.209> at<00:03:34.300> towards<00:03:34.660> WrestleMania

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:35.290 
i'm looking at towards WrestleMania

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:36.270 
i'm looking at towards WrestleMania
what's<00:03:35.500> brought<00:03:35.709> going<00:03:35.950> to<00:03:36.040> do<00:03:36.160> at

00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:36.280 
what's brought going to do at

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:39.690 
what's brought going to do at
WrestleMania<00:03:36.880> if<00:03:37.780> he<00:03:37.959> loses<00:03:38.200> to<00:03:38.440> Punk<00:03:38.709> sure<00:03:39.520> he

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:39.700 
WrestleMania if he loses to Punk sure he

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:41.280 
WrestleMania if he loses to Punk sure he
just<00:03:39.880> came<00:03:40.060> off<00:03:40.209> a<00:03:40.240> win<00:03:40.480> against<00:03:40.750> Triple<00:03:41.020> H<00:03:41.110> but

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:41.290 
just came off a win against Triple H but

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:43.980 
just came off a win against Triple H but
I<00:03:41.350> think<00:03:41.560> another<00:03:41.800> huge<00:03:42.610> wind<00:03:42.880> kind<00:03:43.240> of<00:03:43.360> give

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:43.990 
I think another huge wind kind of give

00:03:43.990 --> 00:03:45.720 
I think another huge wind kind of give
them<00:03:44.140> that<00:03:44.320> momentum<00:03:44.890> to<00:03:45.040> possibly<00:03:45.490> have<00:03:45.700> a

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:45.730 
them that momentum to possibly have a

00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:48.690 
them that momentum to possibly have a
WWE<00:03:46.360> Championship<00:03:46.810> match<00:03:47.340> and<00:03:48.340> that's<00:03:48.520> what<00:03:48.670> I

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:48.700 
WWE Championship match and that's what I

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:49.800 
WWE Championship match and that's what I
