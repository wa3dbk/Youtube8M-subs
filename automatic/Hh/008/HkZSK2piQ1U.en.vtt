00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:23.430
 and this is the little car we are 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:24.960
 trying to take apart for pieces 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:26.580
 necessary to adjust the pedal of the 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:28.140
 bike those hours all those hours 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:34.350

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:45.890
 iron with hemp and we can't 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:45.890
 to break a narrow car 

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:49.230

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:52.440
 half is almost six and we are 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:53.969
 parties and not 20 minutes by bike in 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:55.739
 all this because we are cda 

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:57.449
 I also got the brilliant idea of 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:01:01.109
 tell this individual a few nights 

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:03.300

 because I don't fit the bike but the 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:11.850
 however we go up the big 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:14.040
 all this we observe what is going on 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:15.869
 going on dinners where practically 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:18.960
 we have to get out a microscopic piece 

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:21.330
 human I think a squirrel with a 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:24.180
 pool fall corano de luca that we there 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:27.840

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:29.280
 meanwhile for equal opportunities 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:31.200
