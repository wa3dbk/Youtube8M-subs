really<00:02:36.760> annoying<00:02:37.060> because<00:02:37.269> that<00:02:37.480> plagued<00:02:37.810> me

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:37.930 
really annoying because that plagued me

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:41.370 
really annoying because that plagued me
for<00:02:37.959> couple<00:02:38.680> hours<00:02:38.769> anyway<00:02:39.959> so<00:02:40.959> the<00:02:41.260> only

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:41.380 
for couple hours anyway so the only

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:44.339 
for couple hours anyway so the only
control<00:02:41.680> right<00:02:41.829> now<00:02:41.859> is<00:02:42.220> the<00:02:42.579> gyro<00:02:43.260> so<00:02:44.260> you

00:02:44.339 --> 00:02:44.349 
control right now is the gyro so you

00:02:44.349 --> 00:02:45.659 
control right now is the gyro so you
have<00:02:44.470> to<00:02:44.560> tilt<00:02:44.769> the<00:02:44.829> phone<00:02:45.069> to<00:02:45.280> move<00:02:45.430> the<00:02:45.519> dude

00:02:45.659 --> 00:02:45.669 
have to tilt the phone to move the dude

00:02:45.669 --> 00:02:47.520 
have to tilt the phone to move the dude
around<00:02:45.880> if<00:02:46.630> you<00:02:46.720> only<00:02:46.810> tilted<00:02:47.139> a<00:02:47.200> little<00:02:47.230> bit

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:47.530 
around if you only tilted a little bit

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:49.440 
around if you only tilted a little bit
hill<00:02:47.739> he<00:02:48.250> should<00:02:48.430> walk<00:02:48.639> then<00:02:48.910> if<00:02:49.000> you<00:02:49.090> tilt<00:02:49.299> it

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:49.450 
hill he should walk then if you tilt it

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:53.370 
hill he should walk then if you tilt it
more<00:02:49.720> it<00:02:49.959> shouldn't<00:02:50.260> run<00:02:50.609> but<00:02:51.609> it's<00:02:52.359> not<00:02:52.599> it's

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:53.380 
more it shouldn't run but it's not it's

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:55.949 
more it shouldn't run but it's not it's
not<00:02:53.590> perfect<00:02:54.069> right<00:02:54.250> now<00:02:54.569> some<00:02:55.569> more<00:02:55.720> tweaking

00:02:55.949 --> 00:02:55.959 
not perfect right now some more tweaking

00:02:55.959 --> 00:02:56.870 
not perfect right now some more tweaking
to<00:02:56.139> be<00:02:56.260> done

00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:56.880 
to be done

00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:58.670 
to be done
I'm<00:02:57.510> going<00:02:57.660> to<00:02:57.720> also<00:02:57.900> make<00:02:58.140> the<00:02:58.230> option<00:02:58.500> for

00:02:58.670 --> 00:02:58.680 
I'm going to also make the option for

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:00.580 
I'm going to also make the option for
the<00:02:58.770> d-pad<00:02:59.130> on<00:02:59.220> the<00:02:59.310> screen<00:02:59.610> which<00:03:00.240> I'm<00:03:00.390> not<00:03:00.480> a

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:00.590 
the d-pad on the screen which I'm not a

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:03.470 
the d-pad on the screen which I'm not a
not<00:03:01.590> very<00:03:01.620> fond<00:03:02.010> of<00:03:02.130> it<00:03:02.250> because<00:03:02.490> it<00:03:02.670> can<00:03:03.330> see

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:03.480 
not very fond of it because it can see

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:05.510 
not very fond of it because it can see
from<00:03:03.570> my<00:03:03.660> thumb<00:03:04.230> just<00:03:04.830> gonna<00:03:05.010> take<00:03:05.190> up<00:03:05.280> a<00:03:05.370> lot

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:05.520 
from my thumb just gonna take up a lot

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:09.050 
from my thumb just gonna take up a lot
of<00:03:05.580> space<00:03:05.910> on<00:03:06.240> the<00:03:06.990> screen<00:03:07.320> and<00:03:07.700> I<00:03:08.700> don't<00:03:08.910> like

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:09.060 
of space on the screen and I don't like

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:11.360 
of space on the screen and I don't like
that<00:03:09.270> but<00:03:09.660> this<00:03:10.410> is<00:03:10.560> also<00:03:10.830> really<00:03:10.980> hard<00:03:11.250> to

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:11.370 
that but this is also really hard to

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:12.800 
that but this is also really hard to
control<00:03:11.610> especially<00:03:12.090> when<00:03:12.420> you're<00:03:12.540> trying<00:03:12.660> to

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:12.810 
control especially when you're trying to

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:14.950 
control especially when you're trying to
shoot<00:03:13.080> things<00:03:13.290> while<00:03:13.800> you're<00:03:14.040> moving<00:03:14.190> around

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:14.960 
shoot things while you're moving around

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:19.130 
shoot things while you're moving around
it's<00:03:15.960> very<00:03:16.350> it's<00:03:17.340> very<00:03:17.400> confusing<00:03:17.760> so<00:03:18.420> I'm

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:19.140 
it's very it's very confusing so I'm

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:20.420 
it's very it's very confusing so I'm
probably<00:03:19.290> have<00:03:19.590> to<00:03:19.650> tweak<00:03:19.860> the<00:03:19.950> difficulty<00:03:20.400> of

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:20.430 
probably have to tweak the difficulty of

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:22.040 
probably have to tweak the difficulty of
the<00:03:20.580> game<00:03:20.610> a<00:03:20.760> bit<00:03:21.000> because<00:03:21.210> it<00:03:21.450> was<00:03:21.540> it<00:03:21.900> was<00:03:22.020> a

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:22.050 
the game a bit because it was it was a

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:23.270 
the game a bit because it was it was a
hard<00:03:22.290> were<00:03:22.470> a<00:03:22.500> lot<00:03:22.650> of<00:03:22.680> people<00:03:22.740> on<00:03:22.980> the<00:03:23.040> Windows

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:23.280 
hard were a lot of people on the Windows

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:25.970 
hard were a lot of people on the Windows
version<00:03:23.310> so<00:03:23.880> I<00:03:24.090> think<00:03:25.020> this<00:03:25.230> will<00:03:25.380> be<00:03:25.440> a<00:03:25.680> lot

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:25.980 
version so I think this will be a lot

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:29.750 
version so I think this will be a lot
harder<00:03:26.300> because<00:03:27.300> this<00:03:27.600> is<00:03:27.750> not<00:03:28.070> in<00:03:29.070> my<00:03:29.250> opinion

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:29.760 
harder because this is not in my opinion

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:32.390 
harder because this is not in my opinion
not<00:03:30.060> the<00:03:30.240> best<00:03:30.420> way<00:03:30.570> to<00:03:30.630> control<00:03:30.840> the<00:03:31.050> game<00:03:31.400> so

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:32.400 
not the best way to control the game so

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:34.700 
not the best way to control the game so
we'll<00:03:32.640> see<00:03:32.760> how<00:03:32.880> the<00:03:32.940> d-pad<00:03:33.300> works<00:03:33.540> out<00:03:33.720> we'll

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:34.710 
we'll see how the d-pad works out we'll

00:03:34.710 --> 00:03:37.460 
we'll see how the d-pad works out we'll
from<00:03:34.860> there<00:03:35.360> so<00:03:36.360> without<00:03:36.780> any<00:03:36.840> sound<00:03:37.230> without

00:03:37.460 --> 00:03:37.470 
from there so without any sound without

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:42.080 
from there so without any sound without
any<00:03:37.620> zombies<00:03:38.570> only<00:03:39.570> again<00:03:40.160> 37<00:03:41.160> 38<00:03:41.340> frames<00:03:41.940> a

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:42.090 
any zombies only again 37 38 frames a

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:46.220 
any zombies only again 37 38 frames a
second<00:03:42.480> there<00:03:42.710> then<00:03:43.710> that<00:03:44.340> isn't<00:03:45.120> great<00:03:45.420> it

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:46.230 
second there then that isn't great it

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:48.350 
second there then that isn't great it
could<00:03:46.470> be<00:03:46.620> better<00:03:46.800> I<00:03:47.130> think<00:03:47.580> it<00:03:48.090> should<00:03:48.300> be

00:03:48.350 --> 00:03:48.360 
could be better I think it should be

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:51.860 
could be better I think it should be
better<00:03:50.090> right<00:03:51.090> now<00:03:51.210> I<00:03:51.240> can't<00:03:51.510> change<00:03:51.750> my

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:51.870 
better right now I can't change my

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:53.090 
better right now I can't change my
weapons<00:03:52.320> either<00:03:52.440> because<00:03:52.800> there's<00:03:52.980> no

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:53.100 
weapons either because there's no

00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:55.190 
weapons either because there's no
there's<00:03:53.970> no<00:03:54.000> buttons<00:03:54.420> up<00:03:54.510> there<00:03:54.690> all<00:03:54.900> I<00:03:54.960> can<00:03:55.110> do

00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:55.200 
there's no buttons up there all I can do

00:03:55.200 --> 00:04:01.820 
there's no buttons up there all I can do
is<00:03:55.230> shoot<00:03:55.530> things<00:03:59.660> that's<00:04:00.660> about<00:04:00.900> it<00:04:00.930> but<00:04:01.740> it

00:04:01.820 --> 00:04:01.830 
is shoot things that's about it but it

00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:05.870 
is shoot things that's about it but it
runs<00:04:02.010> I<00:04:02.430> can't<00:04:02.760> believe<00:04:02.880> it<00:04:03.180> runs<00:04:03.420> after<00:04:04.880> some

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:05.880 
runs I can't believe it runs after some

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:07.940 
runs I can't believe it runs after some
of<00:04:05.910> the<00:04:06.060> most<00:04:06.210> stressful<00:04:06.600> coding<00:04:07.560> sessions

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:07.950 
of the most stressful coding sessions

00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:10.700 
of the most stressful coding sessions
that<00:04:08.430> I've<00:04:08.640> ever<00:04:08.820> had<00:04:09.030> in<00:04:09.240> my<00:04:09.270> life<00:04:09.560> getting<00:04:10.560> a

that I've ever had in my life getting a

lego set up the libraries compiled a

00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:17.150 
lego set up the libraries compiled a
daring<00:04:13.380> link<00:04:13.740> that<00:04:14.010> I<00:04:14.040> needed<00:04:14.310> to<00:04:15.890> we<00:04:16.890> still

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:17.160 
daring link that I needed to we still

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:18.710 
daring link that I needed to we still
got<00:04:17.280> some<00:04:17.430> blending<00:04:17.820> issues<00:04:18.120> there<00:04:18.359> that<00:04:18.390> are

00:04:18.710 --> 00:04:18.720 
got some blending issues there that are

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:21.380 
got some blending issues there that are

00:04:21.390 --> 00:04:24.560 
different from OpenGL to Windows version
soon<00:04:21.710> tweet<00:04:22.710> that

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:24.570 
soon tweet that

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:27.530 
soon tweet that
but<00:04:24.900> a<00:04:25.200> lot<00:04:25.470> of<00:04:25.530> optimization<00:04:26.280> to<00:04:26.580> be<00:04:26.670> done<00:04:26.880> if

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:27.540 
but a lot of optimization to be done if

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:30.710 
but a lot of optimization to be done if
you<00:04:27.690> shoot<00:04:27.960> things<00:04:28.940> the<00:04:29.940> shooting<00:04:30.300> routine<00:04:30.600> is

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:30.720 
you shoot things the shooting routine is

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:32.540 
you shoot things the shooting routine is
actually<00:04:31.050> really<00:04:31.260> really<00:04:31.440> slow<00:04:31.830> and<00:04:32.070> makes

00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:32.550 
actually really really slow and makes

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:34.970 
actually really really slow and makes
the<00:04:32.730> whole<00:04:32.850> thing<00:04:32.910> grind<00:04:33.420> to<00:04:33.600> a<00:04:33.630> halt<00:04:33.980> not

00:04:34.970 --> 00:04:34.980 
the whole thing grind to a halt not

00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:36.740 
the whole thing grind to a halt not
doing<00:04:35.490> too<00:04:35.640> bad<00:04:35.850> right<00:04:36.030> now<00:04:36.150> there's<00:04:36.480> not<00:04:36.570> much

00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:36.750 
doing too bad right now there's not much

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:40.010 
doing too bad right now there's not much
on<00:04:36.870> the<00:04:36.960> screen<00:04:37.260> but<00:04:38.570> when<00:04:39.570> you're<00:04:39.690> shooting<00:04:39.840> a

00:04:40.010 --> 00:04:40.020 
on the screen but when you're shooting a

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:42.470 
on the screen but when you're shooting a
couple<00:04:40.320> zombies<00:04:40.680> it<00:04:41.040> really<00:04:41.370> slows<00:04:41.610> down<00:04:41.850> so<00:04:42.240> I

00:04:42.470 --> 00:04:42.480 
couple zombies it really slows down so I

00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:45.230 
couple zombies it really slows down so I
have<00:04:42.750> to<00:04:42.870> basically<00:04:43.230> rewrite<00:04:43.920> that<00:04:44.240> giant

00:04:45.230 --> 00:04:45.240 
have to basically rewrite that giant

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:48.050 
have to basically rewrite that giant
chunk<00:04:45.600> of<00:04:45.720> code<00:04:45.960> so<00:04:46.560> not<00:04:47.550> looking<00:04:47.610> forward<00:04:47.760> to

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:48.060 
chunk of code so not looking forward to

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:52.330 
chunk of code so not looking forward to
that<00:04:48.380> but<00:04:49.380> it's<00:04:50.130> got<00:04:50.280> to<00:04:50.370> be<00:04:50.430> done<00:04:51.050> anyway

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:52.340 
that but it's got to be done anyway

00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:58.310 
that but it's got to be done anyway
considering<00:04:55.700> about<00:04:56.700> four<00:04:57.090> days<00:04:57.270> ago<00:04:57.660> I<00:04:57.930> didn't

00:04:58.310 --> 00:04:58.320 
considering about four days ago I didn't

00:04:58.320 --> 00:05:00.860 
considering about four days ago I didn't
even<00:04:58.410> have<00:04:58.710> xcode<00:04:59.520> working<00:05:00.060> on<00:05:00.180> my<00:05:00.330> Macintosh

00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:00.870 
even have xcode working on my Macintosh

00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:05.800 
even have xcode working on my Macintosh
yet<00:05:01.170> I<00:05:01.200> think<00:05:01.560> this<00:05:01.680> is<00:05:01.740> pretty<00:05:02.250> good<00:05:02.490> progress

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:05.810 

00:05:05.810 --> 00:05:10.190 

all<00:05:06.810> right<00:05:07.020> big<00:05:07.680> Nick<00:05:07.890> out
