 to build new ones of the eu and I have to 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:54.480
 Do not just make a drink 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:56.970
 but you have to think properly 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:58.020
 must do in all areas must be good 

00:00:56.970 --> 00:00:59.970

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:07.729
 history with education actually 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:07.729
 and that's perfect 

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:54.500
 Hello

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:24.930
 really all rules and all the old ones 

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:27.510
 encrusted layers broken up like 

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:29.340
 brings fresh wind in and debates 

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:31.490
 a lot more demanded congratulation 

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:31.490
 to 

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:37.550
 something new at this drink competition 

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:40.180
 that the jury does not leave my passion 

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:42.560
 sitting in front of it can be with the 

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:44.150
 Participants can communicate in question 

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:47.410
 But also the participant can do 

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:47.410
 So to his trip 

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:24.480
 as a tip, so make sure and continue 

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:25.380
 refine this concept further and 

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:29.900
 prosecute 

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:29.900
 I think that is very promising
