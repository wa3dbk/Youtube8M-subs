prosthesis down on that the blank of
foam<00:00:23.779> and<00:00:24.189> I'm<00:00:25.189> going<00:00:25.340> to<00:00:25.400> trace<00:00:25.700> out<00:00:25.970> or

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:26.510 
foam and I'm going to trace out or

00:00:26.510 --> 00:00:28.300 
foam and I'm going to trace out or
measure<00:00:26.689> out<00:00:26.960> like<00:00:27.140> where<00:00:27.350> the<00:00:27.500> socket<00:00:27.949> ends

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:28.310 
measure out like where the socket ends

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:30.460 
measure out like where the socket ends
and<00:00:28.490> the<00:00:29.090> top<00:00:29.300> of<00:00:29.480> the<00:00:29.539> foot<00:00:29.840> and<00:00:30.080> I'll<00:00:30.230> go<00:00:30.350> over

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:30.470 
and the top of the foot and I'll go over

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:32.799 
and the top of the foot and I'll go over
on<00:00:30.680> a<00:00:30.769> band<00:00:31.010> saw<00:00:31.160> and<00:00:31.340> cut<00:00:31.640> off<00:00:31.880> the<00:00:32.059> excess<00:00:32.510> and

00:00:32.799 --> 00:00:32.809 
on a band saw and cut off the excess and

00:00:32.809 --> 00:00:34.900 
on a band saw and cut off the excess and
then<00:00:33.739> I'm<00:00:33.890> going<00:00:34.040> to<00:00:34.100> have<00:00:34.309> to<00:00:34.460> hollow<00:00:34.730> out

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:34.910 
then I'm going to have to hollow out

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:39.040 
then I'm going to have to hollow out
this<00:00:35.390> foam<00:00:35.949> to<00:00:36.949> fit<00:00:37.300> for<00:00:38.300> the<00:00:38.390> socket<00:00:38.750> to<00:00:38.840> fit

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:39.050 
this foam to fit for the socket to fit

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:40.660 
this foam to fit for the socket to fit
down<00:00:39.170> into<00:00:39.440> and<00:00:39.769> then<00:00:39.860> it<00:00:39.949> all<00:00:40.190> slide<00:00:40.460> together

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:40.670 
down into and then it all slide together

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:43.329 
down into and then it all slide together
and<00:00:41.150> we'll<00:00:41.269> bolt<00:00:41.839> it<00:00:41.989> up<00:00:42.140> and<00:00:42.379> it<00:00:42.979> will<00:00:43.070> go<00:00:43.190> over

00:00:43.329 --> 00:00:43.339 
and we'll bolt it up and it will go over

00:00:43.339 --> 00:00:45.039 
and we'll bolt it up and it will go over
on<00:00:43.489> the<00:00:43.549> machine<00:00:43.850> and<00:00:44.000> sand<00:00:44.239> it<00:00:44.360> down<00:00:44.390> grind<00:00:44.930> it

00:00:45.039 --> 00:00:45.049 
on the machine and sand it down grind it

00:00:45.049 --> 00:02:04.890 
on the machine and sand it down grind it
all<00:00:45.140> down

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:04.900
