00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:09.160
 ah 

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:39.059
 this song is from sharp environments 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:41.550
 minor can also be seen as my 

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:44.309
 minor flat never puts they put first 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:45.989
 back they touch as if it were a minor 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:47.820
 first we go with a point then what 

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:50.720
 that makes the second guitar really 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:50.720
 the first sentence series 

00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:56.730
 up there just to do that 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:58.350
 we touch this position would be first 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:02.570
 rope on the 11th fret second string 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:02.570
 of the twelfth we played six times 

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:07.770
 and then we put the little finger in the first 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:12.130
 rope 14 fret we also play the two 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:13.750
 first strings we remove we play 

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:18.600
 we do not touch it the second one in the 

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:23.950
 museum fret first string 11 then 14 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:26.409
 11 14 11 14 and 11 

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:29.520
 the phrase sounds like this again 

00:01:26.409 --> 00:01:29.520
 and point 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:35.360
 up there the next thing would be this 

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:41.250
 Y 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:43.250
 up there to do this whole phrase 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:46.250
 we're going to do this I remembered 

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:46.250
 Sun 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:53.869
 then we do an arpeggio we play the 

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:56.880
 first string on the ninth fret 

00:01:53.869 --> 00:01:59.880
 second rope 11 third rope 11 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:02.280
 then we go back to the second string and 

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:04.440
 we finish on the first string 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:06.060
 then we play the first two strings 

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:10.700
 the first in the ninth the second in the 

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:10.700
 once we play we play six times 

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:15.230
 and then we put the middle in the third 

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:17.870
 rope 11 fret we play the third and the 

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:19.600
 second string we go back to the first and 

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:22.830
 the second 

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:22.830
 and then we go up again 

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:36.970
 to do this we were 

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:39.129
 finished the previous sentence in this 

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:40.870
 position now let's put the finger 

00:02:39.129 --> 00:02:44.050
 cancel on the first eleventh string 

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:46.569
 fret and let's put the index finger 

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:48.879
 also on the first tenth string 

00:02:46.569 --> 00:02:51.030
 fret we make a pull with the finger 

00:02:48.879 --> 00:02:51.030
 cancel 

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:55.890
 she 

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:58.020
 then we went up to this position it would be 

00:02:55.890 --> 00:03:00.300
 second rope concentrate third 

00:02:58.020 --> 00:03:02.580
 rope 10 

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:04.200
 we remove the ring we make sense 

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:07.110
 index on the second ninth string 

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:09.570
 fret we play outsourcing with the rope 

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:11.630
 then we perform the second frets 

00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:15.600
 string seventh fret connected 

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:17.250
 and we finish here third string in the 

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:20.630
 eighth fret fourth which in the eighth 

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:20.630
 he is also back 

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:26.040
 then the plucking is going to repeat 

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:32.290
 Y 

00:03:39.319 --> 00:03:42.129
 we do this 

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:51.240
 to do we play the first string 

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:54.020
 on the sixth fret 

00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:54.020
 then seventh 

00:03:54.910 --> 00:03:58.500
 seventh 

00:03:56.630 --> 00:04:00.850
 sex fret 

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:03.230
 we return to the second with the novel 

00:04:00.850 --> 00:04:05.940
 again 

00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:08.330
 fret 

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:10.390
 seventh 

00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:12.930
 and it was activated 

00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:12.930
 phrase sounds yes 

00:04:20.510 --> 00:04:23.860
 the next sentence would be this 

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:32.830
 to do this 

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:36.870
 in others 

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:36.870
 14 then is fret 

00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:47.520
 9th second string 11 

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:50.460
 then we play again the second with the 

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:53.480
 entailed fret first string 11 and 

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:53.480
 we make a draft to 10 

00:04:53.630 --> 00:04:59.480
 we went back to the second string 11 fret 

00:04:55.700 --> 00:05:02.230
 ninth seventh and we finish in the third 

00:04:59.480 --> 00:05:02.230
 eighth rope back 

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:08.660
 Y 

00:05:09.540 --> 00:05:15.210
 and good what the second guitar does 

00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:17.569
 simple chords we did not know if flat if 

00:05:15.210 --> 00:05:19.009
 is that we see it from d 

00:05:17.569 --> 00:05:24.439
 if we see it from the capo 

00:05:19.009 --> 00:05:29.599
 we would go with the largest of the 

00:05:24.439 --> 00:05:32.740
 seven when it would be the minor d chord 

00:05:29.599 --> 00:05:32.740
 is going to be this 

00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:38.000
 as a simple always final 

00:05:40.460 --> 00:05:46.310
 to do that we play the fifth string 

00:05:43.290 --> 00:05:46.310
 on the sixth fret 

00:05:47.539 --> 00:05:55.510
 then fourth string seventh after noticing 

00:05:52.840 --> 00:05:58.180
 then third string seventh fret and 

00:05:55.510 --> 00:06:00.720
 eighth are like this 

00:05:58.180 --> 00:06:00.720
 i 

00:06:01.289 --> 00:06:05.960
 If you want or can do up here or 

00:06:02.969 --> 00:06:05.960
 It can also be done here 

00:06:07.150 --> 00:06:11.260
 and they want to do it here it would be the fourth 

00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:13.930
 open good rope but this one is 

00:06:11.260 --> 00:06:17.170
 tight with open lid then second 

00:06:13.930 --> 00:06:21.040
 Fret the zero then third string 

00:06:17.170 --> 00:06:24.430
 first fret according to a trace then 

00:06:21.040 --> 00:06:27.000
 second string second back and just 

00:06:24.430 --> 00:06:27.000
 In the third 

00:06:31.910 --> 00:06:35.290
 good this tutorial thank you
