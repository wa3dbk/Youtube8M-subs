00:02:09.199 --> 00:02:09.209 
possibility that providing a coffin

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:10.910 
possibility that providing a coffin
Pacquiao<00:02:09.599> really<00:02:10.259> could<00:02:10.410> fight<00:02:10.619> each<00:02:10.770> other

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:10.920

obviously I mean I say obviously
I'm<00:02:14.129> assuming<00:02:15.120> that<00:02:15.900> should<00:02:16.200> a<00:02:16.230> fight<00:02:16.530> between

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:16.890

00:02:22.009 --> 00:02:22.019 
obviously be in Pacquiao's corner and

00:02:22.019 --> 00:02:23.690 
obviously be in Pacquiao's corner and
someone<00:02:22.319> else<00:02:22.470> would<00:02:22.709> go<00:02:22.860> in<00:02:23.010> providing<00:02:23.549> the

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:23.700
