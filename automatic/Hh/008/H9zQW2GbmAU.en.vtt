00:00:28.620 --> 00:00:28.630 
create images of high contrast to in

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:32.220 
create images of high contrast to in

high contrast effect known as

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:37.110 
high contrast effect known as
chiaroscuro<00:00:35.410> can<00:00:36.070> be<00:00:36.190> easily<00:00:36.370> achieved<00:00:36.880> using

chiaroscuro can be easily achieved using

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:41.130 
chiaroscuro can be easily achieved using
a<00:00:37.360> sign<00:00:37.600> lit<00:00:37.809> single<00:00:38.200> light<00:00:38.350> source<00:00:40.140> let's

lowkey high contrast photo as you can

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:34.460 
lowkey high contrast photo as you can
see<00:01:32.490> the<00:01:33.300> rim<00:01:33.450> light<00:01:33.690> coming<00:01:34.020> from<00:01:34.050> the<00:01:34.260> side

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
see the rim light coming from the side

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:37.550 
see the rim light coming from the side
is<00:01:34.680> too<00:01:34.950> harsh<00:01:35.220> and<00:01:35.780> the<00:01:36.780> angle<00:01:37.110> of<00:01:37.170> lighting

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
is too harsh and the angle of lighting

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:40.040 
is too harsh and the angle of lighting
is<00:01:37.710> not<00:01:37.950> all<00:01:38.130> right<00:01:38.270> it<00:01:39.270> makes<00:01:39.480> the<00:01:39.630> subjects

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:40.050 
is not all right it makes the subjects

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:43.100 
is not all right it makes the subjects
face<00:01:40.200> look<00:01:40.500> weird<00:01:41.060> lowkey<00:01:42.060> and<00:01:42.480> high<00:01:42.630> contrast

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110 
face look weird lowkey and high contrast

face look weird lowkey and high contrast
lighting<00:01:43.320> style<00:01:43.680> is<00:01:44.160> typical<00:01:44.790> in<00:01:44.940> Hollywood

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:45.360 
lighting style is typical in Hollywood

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:48.109 
lighting style is typical in Hollywood
movies<00:01:45.720> especially<00:01:46.410> with<00:01:47.310> horror<00:01:47.550> films<00:01:47.940> and

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:48.119 
movies especially with horror films and

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:50.900 
movies especially with horror films and
detective<00:01:48.810> stories<00:01:49.200> in<00:01:49.560> the<00:01:49.710> older<00:01:49.920> days<00:01:49.950> it

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:50.910 
detective stories in the older days it

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:54.020 
detective stories in the older days it
works<00:01:51.210> well<00:01:51.479> to<00:01:51.750> create<00:01:52.020> dramatic<00:01:52.200> images<00:01:53.030> but

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
works well to create dramatic images but

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:56.180 
works well to create dramatic images but
it<00:01:54.360> requires<00:01:54.840> the<00:01:55.050> subjects<00:01:55.470> to<00:01:55.860> hold<00:01:56.040> the

00:01:56.180 --> 00:01:56.190 
it requires the subjects to hold the

00:01:56.190 --> 00:01:58.660 
it requires the subjects to hold the
position<00:01:56.640> well<00:01:56.850> for<00:01:57.390> desirable<00:01:57.930> effects

00:01:58.660 --> 00:01:58.670 
position well for desirable effects

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:03.109 
position well for desirable effects
otherwise<00:01:59.670> it<00:02:00.030> ends<00:02:00.720> up<00:02:00.869> like<00:02:01.050> this<00:02:02.119> that's

00:02:03.109 --> 00:02:03.119 
otherwise it ends up like this that's

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:05.390 
otherwise it ends up like this that's
why<00:02:03.270> you<00:02:03.780> always<00:02:03.810> find<00:02:04.290> nicely<00:02:04.800> lit<00:02:04.950> actors

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:05.400 
why you always find nicely lit actors

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:07.609 
why you always find nicely lit actors
and<00:02:05.580> actresses<00:02:05.970> stand<00:02:06.750> still<00:02:06.960> in<00:02:07.200> a<00:02:07.320> position

00:02:07.609 --> 00:02:07.619 
and actresses stand still in a position

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:10.100 
and actresses stand still in a position
and<00:02:08.340> recite<00:02:08.760> the<00:02:08.940> dialogue<00:02:09.330> all<00:02:09.690> the<00:02:09.959> way

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:10.110 
and recite the dialogue all the way

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:12.890 
and recite the dialogue all the way
through<00:02:10.440> a<00:02:10.470> sin<00:02:11.209> because<00:02:12.209> if<00:02:12.420> they<00:02:12.570> would<00:02:12.750> move

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:12.900 
through a sin because if they would move

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:15.260 
through a sin because if they would move
a<00:02:13.080> bit<00:02:13.260> it<00:02:13.770> ruins<00:02:14.220> the<00:02:14.370> endless<00:02:14.700> effort<00:02:14.880> to

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:15.270 
a bit it ruins the endless effort to

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:18.620 
a bit it ruins the endless effort to
light<00:02:15.420> them<00:02:15.600> up<00:02:15.720> so<00:02:15.930> precisely<00:02:16.380> if<00:02:17.269> we<00:02:18.269> insist

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:18.630 
light them up so precisely if we insist

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:20.840 
light them up so precisely if we insist
like<00:02:18.959> I'm<00:02:19.110> subjects<00:02:19.530> this<00:02:19.680> wedding<00:02:19.980> they<00:02:20.670> will

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:20.850 
like I'm subjects this wedding they will

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:23.030 
like I'm subjects this wedding they will
end<00:02:21.000> up<00:02:21.090> as<00:02:21.300> a<00:02:21.330> robot<00:02:21.780> and<00:02:22.350> we<00:02:22.500> can't<00:02:22.769> capture

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:23.040 
end up as a robot and we can't capture

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:27.020 
end up as a robot and we can't capture
the<00:02:23.280> gesture<00:02:23.730> in<00:02:23.910> the<00:02:24.030> most<00:02:24.239> creative<00:02:24.720> way<00:02:26.030> so

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:27.030 
the gesture in the most creative way so

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:29.210 
the gesture in the most creative way so
we<00:02:27.239> try<00:02:27.450> another<00:02:27.660> way<00:02:28.019> to<00:02:28.470> light<00:02:28.650> up<00:02:28.830> the<00:02:28.980> scene

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:29.220 
we try another way to light up the scene

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:31.340 
we try another way to light up the scene
which<00:02:29.970> is<00:02:30.150> to<00:02:30.330> balance<00:02:30.540> the<00:02:30.750> light<00:02:30.930> of<00:02:31.110> a

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:31.350 
which is to balance the light of a

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:34.699 
which is to balance the light of a
reflector<00:02:31.830> far<00:02:32.160> away<00:02:32.750> however<00:02:33.750> this<00:02:34.320> is<00:02:34.470> way

00:02:34.699 --> 00:02:34.709 
reflector far away however this is way

00:02:34.709 --> 00:02:37.780 
reflector far away however this is way
too<00:02:34.739> dark<00:02:35.160> and<00:02:35.370> the<00:02:36.060> tone<00:02:36.269> too<00:02:36.570> warm<00:02:36.870> as<00:02:37.050> well

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:37.790 
too dark and the tone too warm as well

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:40.430 
too dark and the tone too warm as well
then<00:02:38.790> we<00:02:39.000> open<00:02:39.239> up<00:02:39.300> the<00:02:39.360> lens<00:02:39.630> by<00:02:39.870> half<00:02:40.110> a<00:02:40.140> stop

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:40.440 
then we open up the lens by half a stop

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:42.199 
then we open up the lens by half a stop
which<00:02:41.040> makes<00:02:41.310> the<00:02:41.459> tone<00:02:41.640> look<00:02:41.970> more

00:02:42.199 --> 00:02:42.209 
which makes the tone look more

00:02:42.209 --> 00:02:44.020 
which makes the tone look more
acceptable

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:44.030 
acceptable
