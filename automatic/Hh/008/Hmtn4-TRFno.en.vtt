00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:21.500 
he likes the belly and that's why I
bring<00:03:19.500> the<00:03:19.650> superset<00:03:20.220> cuz<00:03:20.459> you<00:03:20.640> just<00:03:20.670> hit<00:03:21.209> so

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:21.510 
bring the superset cuz you just hit so

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:23.630 
bring the superset cuz you just hit so
much<00:03:21.690> harder<00:03:22.200> it's<00:03:22.739> almost<00:03:22.980> like<00:03:23.220> using<00:03:23.430> a

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:23.640 
much harder it's almost like using a

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:26.270 
much harder it's almost like using a
black<00:03:23.879> mask<00:03:24.239> you<00:03:24.599> and<00:03:24.959> you<00:03:25.079> once<00:03:25.680> you<00:03:25.799> use<00:03:26.129> the

00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:26.280 
black mask you and you once you use the

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:31.430 
black mask you and you once you use the
bracelet<00:03:26.819> of<00:03:28.400> course<00:03:29.599> yeah<00:03:30.599> there's<00:03:30.870> an<00:03:31.049> altar

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:31.440 
bracelet of course yeah there's an altar

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:33.410 
bracelet of course yeah there's an altar
but<00:03:32.040> I<00:03:32.280> think<00:03:32.549> it's<00:03:32.700> still<00:03:32.849> good<00:03:33.060> to<00:03:33.150> bring<00:03:33.329> a

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:33.420 
but I think it's still good to bring a

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:38.930 
but I think it's still good to bring a
prayer<00:03:33.690> potion<00:03:36.560> also<00:03:37.560> another<00:03:38.400> little<00:03:38.700> trick

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:38.940 
prayer potion also another little trick

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:43.550 
prayer potion also another little trick
if<00:03:39.209> I<00:03:39.420> even<00:03:40.049> take<00:03:40.230> any<00:03:40.410> game<00:03:40.709> I<00:03:40.739> do<00:03:41.040> 38<00:03:41.810> I<00:03:42.810> even

00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:43.560 
if I even take any game I do 38 I even

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:55.000 
if I even take any game I do 38 I even
take<00:03:43.709> any<00:03:43.890> damage<00:03:50.209> see<00:03:51.209> if<00:03:51.269> I<00:03:51.390> click<00:03:51.450> this<00:03:51.750> kale

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:55.010 

00:03:55.010 --> 00:03:59.380 

you<00:03:56.010> can<00:03:56.250> eat<00:03:56.640> while<00:03:57.000> you're<00:03:57.209> attacking<00:03:57.629> I

00:03:59.380 --> 00:03:59.390 
you can eat while you're attacking I

00:03:59.390 --> 00:04:10.860
