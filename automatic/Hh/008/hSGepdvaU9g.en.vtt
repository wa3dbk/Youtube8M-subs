00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:19.510
 Hello dear viewers with you 

00:00:17.170 --> 00:00:22.180
 where is moss-1 and today I will tell you about 

00:00:19.510 --> 00:00:24.640
 probably we will twist each of you 

00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:27.790
 sailed deep and saw 

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:28.829
 strange creature it was a squid octopus 

00:00:27.790 --> 00:00:33.340
 or octopus 

00:00:28.829 --> 00:00:35.170
 call it what you want is an octopus 

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:36.640
 friendly could that was added in 

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:39.910
 game update beta 

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:42.280
 1.2 octopus lives in big bugs 

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:45.370
 depth often in groups of several themselves 

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:47.740
 from 2 to 5 they are executed on any 

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:50.200
 difficulty level and does not attack the player when 

00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:52.390
 any circumstances like others 

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:55.120
 friendly can only 

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:56.670
 practical benefits of spruts getting 

00:00:55.120 --> 00:01:01.030
 ink bags 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:03.160
 after update 1.4.4 

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:05.680
 here they can exist out of the water and 

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:06.720
 will suffocate being thrown on 

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:09.329
 Coast 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:13.360
 behavior of the octopus swim aimlessly 

00:01:09.329 --> 00:01:15.640
 trying to hang around the bottom of the reservoir 

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:18.970
 which they turned out to be if the depth 

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:20.710
 reservoir in which it turned out labor one 

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:24.159
 block who are some parts of it 

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:26.440
 moba will be above the water if the sport 

00:01:24.159 --> 00:01:27.580
 will face the shore thats 

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:29.440
 make noise 

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:32.229
 similar to what is produced 

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:34.870
 ground mobs colliding with blocks 

00:01:32.229 --> 00:01:38.530
 when the octopus moves under water 

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:40.600
 also what then his player attacks him 

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:43.740
 tentacle closes and opens 

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:47.080
 very quickly and his teeth are visible let's say 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:48.150
 spruts will not attack the player even 

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:52.180
 if he is here 

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:56.049
 if the player starts to attack his health 

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:59.320
 has 5 hearts spawn water 

00:01:56.049 --> 00:02:02.920
 everywhere in the water in the oceans vazir small 

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:05.369
 pond and friend only ink bag 

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:08.590
 from 0 to 3 

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:10.509
 spawn of the octopus to be performed water on any 

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:14.319
 depth may appear like blocks 

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:16.390
 sources such are his channels octopus 

00:02:14.319 --> 00:02:20.020
 can theoretically appear in the pool 

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:22.209
 size 1 on 1 again for one block 

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:23.860
 although the probability of this is extremely small 

00:02:22.209 --> 00:02:26.080
 lighting level not 

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:28.410
 no value prerequisite 

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:30.970
 is the presence of a transparent block 

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:32.110
 directly selected for 

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:35.440
 full of water 

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:38.770
 such when another block is air glass 

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:40.870
 ice or other octopus will not 

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:44.590
 appear in a pool 1 block deep 

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:46.870
 closed on top of the stone a little text 

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:49.900
 also spawning which you need to ponder 

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:51.760
 let's say the reason for the known complexity 

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:55.150
 and sprout breeding is low 

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:59.530
 spawn raid aquatic inhabitants it is three 

00:02:55.150 --> 00:03:01.989
 times lower than in land animals and 14 

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:04.000
 times less monsters maximum 

00:03:01.989 --> 00:03:07.570
 the number of spruts at which the game 

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:10.630
 will eat from spawning them another six 

00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:14.200
 by six percent on each player this 

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:17.260
 means that a single player will appear after 

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:21.060
 the appearance of 6 spruts can span completely 

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:23.110
 stop before they die or d spawn 

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:26.200
 however, the map may appear 

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:29.200
 effective up to 6 octopus per one chang 

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:30.790
 if each is randomly selected for 

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:35.410
 spawn spot comes across to sell 

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:37.989
 suitable block the rest are valid those 

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:40.060
 same rules as for other groups 

00:03:37.989 --> 00:03:42.600
 can usb areas she is 

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:45.160
 square plot 17 for 17 chunks 

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:48.130
 around the player 

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:53.200
 excluding blocks at a distance of 2 to 24 

00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:57.040
 meters from the player now let's 

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:59.769
 consider the secrets and facts spruts have 

00:03:57.040 --> 00:04:02.590
 8 tentacles with just impossible to catch on 

00:03:59.769 --> 00:04:06.850
 fishing rod and pull it out this way 

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:09.400
 water connection from error sprints to 1.4.4 

00:04:06.850 --> 00:04:12.580
 could float me water and even air 

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:15.700
 atrocities with this version of the sport and die 

00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:18.549
 in not water choking before sprut not 

00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:21.430
 could and float only dive 

00:04:18.549 --> 00:04:22.510
 after upgrade beta 1.3 can float 

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:25.419
 in three dimensions 

00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:28.450
 when receiving damage sprut it with octopus 

00:04:25.419 --> 00:04:32.530
 can raise or drop by one 

00:04:28.450 --> 00:04:36.129
 third or 1 / block height dying 

00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:39.249
 doesn't fall on its side 

00:04:36.129 --> 00:04:41.830
 continues to swim for about a second then 

00:04:39.249 --> 00:04:44.639
 sometimes the pond disappears and may appear 

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:47.529
 the air 

00:04:44.639 --> 00:04:49.959
 quiet drifting in a boat or just 

00:04:47.529 --> 00:04:52.719
 being closer you can hear 

00:04:49.959 --> 00:04:54.869
 the rustles of the octopus concerning despite 

00:04:52.719 --> 00:04:58.300
 the presence of a large tooth 

00:04:54.869 --> 00:05:01.830
 toothy to get does not attack the player 

00:04:58.300 --> 00:05:03.999
 can sometimes appear in the underground lake 

00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:07.509
 floating on the surface of the water 

00:05:03.999 --> 00:05:09.149
 pose a danger to the boat that is 

00:05:07.509 --> 00:05:12.069
 like the shore 

00:05:09.149 --> 00:05:13.779
 pond and flying mice are the only ones 

00:05:12.069 --> 00:05:17.879
 friendly mobs are not capable of 

00:05:13.779 --> 00:05:21.629
 breeding up to 1.6 rods in the morning 

00:05:17.879 --> 00:05:27.279
 began to choke and take damage 

00:05:21.629 --> 00:05:29.559
 swim floating on the surface of the water and on 

00:05:27.279 --> 00:05:32.019
 that's all thanks for watching you 

00:05:29.559 --> 00:05:35.759
 dima uhadi put please like me 

00:05:32.019 --> 00:05:35.759
