00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:46.580 
as you can see they're much fuzzier I we

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:49.120 
as you can see they're much fuzzier I we
did<00:02:46.910> they<00:02:47.360> didn't<00:02:47.690> have<00:02:47.960> any<00:02:48.290> of<00:02:48.680> the<00:02:48.920> long

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:49.130 
did they didn't have any of the long

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:54.490 
did they didn't have any of the long
forever<00:02:49.880> so<00:02:50.840> we<00:02:50.960> want<00:02:51.230> with<00:02:51.410> that<00:02:51.440> and<00:02:53.170> then<00:02:54.170> if

00:02:54.490 --> 00:02:54.500 
forever so we want with that and then if

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:56.380 
forever so we want with that and then if
you're<00:02:54.680> too<00:02:54.860> lazy<00:02:55.100> to<00:02:55.490> make<00:02:55.610> the<00:02:55.820> music<00:02:55.880> fails

00:02:56.380 --> 00:02:56.390 
you're too lazy to make the music fails

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:59.260 
you're too lazy to make the music fails
you<00:02:56.840> can<00:02:56.870> just<00:02:57.320> obviously<00:02:57.830> get<00:02:58.340> a<00:02:58.580> real<00:02:58.970> tail

00:02:59.260 --> 00:02:59.270 
you can just obviously get a real tail

00:02:59.270 --> 00:03:02.440 
you can just obviously get a real tail
like<00:03:00.170> I<00:03:00.350> have<00:03:00.590> two<00:03:00.800> little<00:03:00.830> tips<00:03:01.280> I<00:03:01.489> have<00:03:02.150> this

00:04:22.629 --> 00:04:22.639 
then put extra safety so that it doesn't

00:04:22.639 --> 00:04:25.990 
then put extra safety so that it doesn't
come<00:04:22.850> off<00:04:22.970> what<00:04:23.300> I<00:04:23.419> did<00:04:23.750> is<00:04:24.020> I<00:04:24.979> folded<00:04:25.940> the

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:26.000 
come off what I did is I folded the

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.740 
come off what I did is I folded the
fabric<00:04:26.270> over<00:04:26.750> like<00:04:26.930> that<00:04:27.169> and<00:04:27.440> glued<00:04:27.889> smaller

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:28.750 
fabric over like that and glued smaller

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:31.210 
fabric over like that and glued smaller
but<00:04:29.750> it's<00:04:29.990> still<00:04:30.289> all<00:04:30.440> these<00:04:30.620> three<00:04:30.800> jingles

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:31.220 
but it's still all these three jingles

00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:39.129 
but it's still all these three jingles
and<00:04:32.440> then<00:04:33.440> you'll<00:04:34.100> take<00:04:35.350> the<00:04:36.350> hooks<00:04:37.150> and<00:04:38.150> glue

00:04:39.129 --> 00:04:39.139 
and then you'll take the hooks and glue

00:04:39.139 --> 00:04:47.290 
and then you'll take the hooks and glue
them<00:04:39.520> one<00:04:40.520> on<00:04:40.820> each<00:04:41.330> side<00:04:41.800> and<00:04:43.870> then<00:04:45.789> voila<00:04:46.789> you

00:04:47.290 --> 00:04:47.300 
them one on each side and then voila you

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:51.939 
them one on each side and then voila you
have<00:04:47.330> it<00:04:49.300> but<00:04:50.300> by<00:04:50.900> the<00:04:50.960> way<00:04:51.199> be<00:04:51.680> careful

00:04:51.939 --> 00:04:51.949 
have it but by the way be careful

00:04:51.949 --> 00:04:55.240 
have it but by the way be careful
