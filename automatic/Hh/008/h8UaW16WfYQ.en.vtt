00:00:00.079 --> 00:00:06.589
 hello hello friends 

00:00:03.140 --> 00:00:15.660
 present you my new work 

00:00:06.589 --> 00:00:18.060
 here's a knife start with need i need 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:21.560
 recently began to make linoleum 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:25.949
 I really liked this stuff 

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:29.039
 it is here as sheath for need 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:32.669
 let's say well here's the only thing 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:37.260
 Here's the details of the elements of this 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:39.960
 mount made of leather mount itself 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:42.629
 made of black leather because 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:44.899
 will have to get dirty there and she is ceramic 

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:51.559
 everything is not visible aesthetic pure 

00:00:44.899 --> 00:00:56.430
 mount as you see on the belt and here 

00:00:51.559 --> 00:01:01.109
 well expired for the hole to drain the moisture 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:05.549
 there on the pedals here are very simple 

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:10.619
 lungs owe them said such and 

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:15.780
 cumbersome need so now she 

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:21.420
 it means the knife itself is made of such 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:26.810
 file I will go to the island just yet 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:30.000
 Soviet times, well understood form itself 

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:32.540
 already pouring such thoughts yes and to 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:35.549
 make a double-edged knife 

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:39.509
 Naturally there was a file 

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:42.350
 worked out practically nothing to do 

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:44.659
 it was impossible to work well, I had to 

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:48.299
 understandably 

00:01:44.659 --> 00:01:52.680
 to get the teeth all right 

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:55.110
 It turned out that way 

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:57.210
 knows should be given visible and even 

00:01:55.110 --> 00:02:02.380
 left price since Soviet times 

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:07.840
 30 kopecks here 

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:15.069
 Well what can you tell him the size of the whole 

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:19.569
 knife 26 centimeters wedge length 14 s 

00:02:15.069 --> 00:02:23.650
 a half centimeters a grip 

00:02:19.569 --> 00:02:27.760
 eleven and a half centimeters this 

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:31.390
 I will say coldness world at once because 

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:36.360
 naturally not proud and did not 

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:39.040
 just do it so that it is not cold and 

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:41.560
 shank when only comes on one 

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:43.830
 third hand grip way up 

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:46.239
 wooden birch 

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:48.819
 Well, of course not had to 

00:02:46.239 --> 00:02:53.640
 work to make it look like this 

00:02:48.819 --> 00:02:57.849
 cute with such a pattern it's all here 

00:02:53.640 --> 00:03:00.790
 So pommel purely from practical goals 

00:02:57.849 --> 00:03:04.750
 well maybe even aesthetically pleasing 

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:05.970
 cute looks that is not enough to 

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:11.079
 whether there fell 

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:14.230
 threw something wrong and did not disclose 

00:03:11.079 --> 00:03:18.609
 the grip here is the screw just he 

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:25.600
 turns on you have a knife can not be removed 

00:03:18.609 --> 00:03:28.680
 toss has its balance also with 

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:28.680
 Now wait a minute 

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:39.840
 have so little bluing 

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:43.090
 it is correct to say blacker in a coca cola 

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:47.520
 that is, to blackening them 

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:50.410
 I used it because I heard it 

00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:55.420
 opinion that here they are knives yes 

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:59.380
 take tactical out and sort of 

00:03:55.420 --> 00:04:02.290
 for domestic purposes has not here 

00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:04.690
 but what is interesting by the way did not say 

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:08.320
 the thickness here is the widest 

00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:13.300
 in the middle of a thick spot yes somewhere 4 

00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:15.940
 about four millimeters, here I am 

00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:17.470
 tried to use well, of course 

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:22.419
 first on products 

00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:24.010
 Well, let's say Apple does not cut 

00:04:22.419 --> 00:04:28.300
 that is, it starts to cut later 

00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:30.880
 splits bread too need to cut on 

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:33.880
 a blackboard so that there is such a dump of such 

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:36.370
 pieces that is normal if cut so 

00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:38.430
 this is not very convenient because 

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:41.380
 but still, the thickness is greater 

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:45.430
 here is a strict piece of wood just 

00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:49.930
 well can cut off how to cut it that 

00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:53.130
 there how much I just tried too 

00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:56.320
 was excellent sharpening keeps fine and 

00:04:53.130 --> 00:04:59.680
 plus of course a double-edged knife in that 

00:04:56.320 --> 00:05:02.550
 that even if the cutting edge was dull 

00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:05.440
 on the one hand you can flip and 

00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:08.039
 finish what the other side needs 

00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:14.650
 then he can treat 

00:05:08.039 --> 00:05:16.770
 Well, what else can you say is not cut 

00:05:14.650 --> 00:05:18.970
 chicken really do not know how to bones 

00:05:16.770 --> 00:05:21.669
 I think that I should because I become 

00:05:18.970 --> 00:05:24.880
 actually a good understand why 

00:05:21.669 --> 00:05:28.570
 did plush become good it was a pity 

00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:31.260
 so let the waste file can 

00:05:28.570 --> 00:05:36.710
 throw here cut 

00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:40.380
 meat and ice cream and fish also have no more 

00:05:36.710 --> 00:05:43.530
 copes well too, like meat 

00:05:40.380 --> 00:05:55.280
 not quite true you start ice cream and 

00:05:43.530 --> 00:05:55.280
 walk away but still like this well what else 

00:05:55.610 --> 00:06:03.180
 naturally he is still more 

00:05:59.480 --> 00:06:06.690
 I agree a tactical and yes felling 

00:06:03.180 --> 00:06:10.280
 chop wood chips but took the other cheek 

00:06:06.690 --> 00:06:13.620
 short pericol windows put it so here 

00:06:10.280 --> 00:06:17.970
 crushed because I understand well here 

00:06:13.620 --> 00:06:22.950
 much not only here but have to cook 

00:06:17.970 --> 00:06:25.830
 but only by what we strike 

00:06:22.950 --> 00:06:29.100
 gradually he is killed we are essentially all 

00:06:25.830 --> 00:06:36.200
 still there is such a moment that the crud 

00:06:29.100 --> 00:06:38.610
 cut down the desire here well of course knives 

00:06:36.200 --> 00:06:40.950
 humble on the one hand they are more 

00:06:38.610 --> 00:06:42.660
 whether and when preferred 

00:06:40.950 --> 00:06:47.880
 the same craft 

00:06:42.660 --> 00:06:53.400
 Well, if necessary, use it 

00:06:47.880 --> 00:06:56.820
 he of course well, well, although I repeat 

00:06:53.400 --> 00:07:02.130
 more certainly more tactically here 

00:06:56.820 --> 00:07:05.810
 I got such a knife thanks 

00:07:02.130 --> 00:07:05.810
 for your attention for now
