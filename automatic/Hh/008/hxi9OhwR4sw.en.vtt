giant men and you know stuff whatever
I'm<00:01:06.960> tired<00:01:07.200> let<00:01:08.100> me<00:01:08.189> alone<00:01:08.340> anyway<00:01:09.180> so<00:01:09.840> our

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:10.970 
I'm tired let me alone anyway so our

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:15.530 
I'm tired let me alone anyway so our
space<00:01:11.970> hmm<00:01:12.750> pretty<00:01:13.260> easy<00:01:13.520> so<00:01:14.520> these<00:01:15.180> double

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540 
space hmm pretty easy so these double

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:17.420 
space hmm pretty easy so these double
giant<00:01:15.720> bombs<00:01:15.840> locations<00:01:16.470> don't<00:01:17.040> really<00:01:17.250> work

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:17.430 
giant bombs locations don't really work

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:20.539 
giant bombs locations don't really work
everything<00:01:18.210> passed<00:01:18.600> around<00:01:18.780> it<00:01:19.189> these<00:01:20.189> double

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 
everything passed around it these double

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:22.359 
everything passed around it these double
giant<00:01:20.729> bombs<00:01:20.850> locations<00:01:21.509> don't<00:01:21.750> really<00:01:21.930> work

00:01:22.359 --> 00:01:22.369 
giant bombs locations don't really work

00:01:22.369 --> 00:01:25.340 
giant bombs locations don't really work
everything<00:01:23.369> pass<00:01:23.729> around<00:01:24.030> it<00:01:24.210> okay<00:01:24.930> so

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
everything pass around it okay so

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:27.800 
everything pass around it okay so
there's<00:01:25.650> no<00:01:25.770> real<00:01:26.040> path<00:01:26.790> across<00:01:27.119> that<00:01:27.420> way<00:01:27.570> and

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
there's no real path across that way and

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:29.990 
there's no real path across that way and
the<00:01:28.710> pass<00:01:28.950> across<00:01:29.130> that<00:01:29.369> was<00:01:29.520> never<00:01:29.790> passed

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
the pass across that was never passed

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.149 
the pass across that was never passed
across<00:01:30.210> that<00:01:30.450> way<00:01:30.600> or<00:01:30.810> that<00:01:30.840> way<00:01:31.020> so<00:01:31.650> it<00:01:31.950> pretty

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159 
across that way or that way so it pretty

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:37.819 
across that way or that way so it pretty
much<00:01:32.220> negates<00:01:33.470> these<00:01:34.909> four<00:01:35.909> positions<00:01:36.829> ends

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:37.829 
much negates these four positions ends

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:40.940 
much negates these four positions ends
up<00:01:37.950> being<00:01:38.729> most<00:01:39.659> likely<00:01:40.020> double<00:01:40.590> jump<00:01:40.799> off

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
up being most likely double jump off

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:43.760 
up being most likely double jump off
those<00:01:41.189> two<00:01:41.369> locations<00:01:42.380> that<00:01:43.380> could<00:01:43.590> actually

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
those two locations that could actually

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:45.740 
those two locations that could actually
be<00:01:43.979> some<00:01:44.310> of<00:01:44.369> them<00:01:44.460> not<00:01:44.640> so<00:01:44.700> sure<00:01:44.939> I<00:01:45.149> know<00:01:45.420> those

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750 
be some of them not so sure I know those

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:49.010 
be some of them not so sure I know those
two<00:01:46.079> there<00:01:46.290> but<00:01:46.619> yeah<00:01:47.240> if<00:01:48.240> there's<00:01:48.659> two<00:01:48.810> there

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
two there but yeah if there's two there

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:50.600 
two there but yeah if there's two there
it's<00:01:49.170> a<00:01:49.200> really<00:01:49.350> bad<00:01:49.530> position<00:01:49.710> due<00:01:50.130> to<00:01:50.399> the

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:50.610 
it's a really bad position due to the

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:53.060 
it's a really bad position due to the
archer<00:01:50.880> Queen<00:01:51.060> if<00:01:51.210> there's<00:01:51.270> two<00:01:51.869> there<00:01:52.110> two

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:53.070 
archer Queen if there's two there two

archer Queen if there's two there two
layers<00:01:53.280> really<00:01:53.549> bad<00:01:53.700> position<00:01:53.820> due<00:01:54.210> to<00:01:54.329> the

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420 
layers really bad position due to the

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:57.260 
layers really bad position due to the
arch<00:01:54.540> cream<00:01:55.430> let's<00:01:56.430> say<00:01:56.610> I'm<00:01:56.759> pretty<00:01:57.090> tired
