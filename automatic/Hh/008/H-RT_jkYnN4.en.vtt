ahead and removed the battery and the
hard<00:00:23.730> drive<00:00:24.000> just<00:00:24.269> so<00:00:25.140> nothing<00:00:25.410> gets<00:00:25.560> powered

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:25.890 
hard drive just so nothing gets powered

behind the screen here there's a little
bit<00:00:33.899> of<00:00:33.989> a<00:00:34.110> cable<00:00:34.380> that's<00:00:34.649> taped<00:00:34.950> up<00:00:35.130> here

00:00:35.299 --> 00:00:35.309 
bit of a cable that's taped up here

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:38.290 
bit of a cable that's taped up here
probably<00:00:35.700> where<00:00:36.059> a<00:00:36.090> webcam<00:00:36.660> would<00:00:36.870> have<00:00:36.960> gone

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:38.300 
probably where a webcam would have gone

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:40.520 
probably where a webcam would have gone
let<00:00:39.300> me<00:00:39.360> go<00:00:39.510> ahead<00:00:39.690> and<00:00:39.780> remove<00:00:39.870> these<00:00:40.230> screws

00:00:47.959 --> 00:00:47.969 
hold the screen onto the backing up the

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:02.090 
laptop all the way here I'm gonna kind
of<00:01:00.899> keep<00:01:01.079> those<00:01:01.260> together<00:01:01.440> and<00:01:01.800> cancer<00:01:02.070> a

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100 
of keep those together and cancer a

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:04.280 
of keep those together and cancer a
little<00:01:02.280> bit<00:01:02.399> of<00:01:02.489> a<00:01:02.550> different<00:01:02.879> size<00:01:03.120> okay<00:01:04.080> now

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290 
little bit of a different size okay now

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:06.020 
little bit of a different size okay now
what<00:01:04.470> you<00:01:04.500> have<00:01:04.680> here<00:01:04.860> is<00:01:05.250> you<00:01:05.400> have<00:01:05.610> the<00:01:05.790> the

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
what you have here is you have the the

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:08.960 
what you have here is you have the the
backing<00:01:06.540> is<00:01:06.630> basically<00:01:07.110> all<00:01:07.290> off<00:01:07.700> you<00:01:08.700> do

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
backing is basically all off you do

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:11.000 
backing is basically all off you do
still<00:01:09.270> have<00:01:09.420> some<00:01:09.450> cables<00:01:09.960> attached<00:01:10.320> that<00:01:10.890> are

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010 
still have some cables attached that are

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:11.960 
still have some cables attached that are
all<00:01:11.159> going<00:01:11.340> to<00:01:11.400> be<00:01:11.460> connected<00:01:11.820> underneath

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
all going to be connected underneath

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:15.830 
all going to be connected underneath
here<00:01:12.920> probably<00:01:13.920> the<00:01:14.220> easiest<00:01:14.760> thing<00:01:14.970> to<00:01:15.119> do<00:01:15.630> is

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
here probably the easiest thing to do is

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:17.649 
here probably the easiest thing to do is
going<00:01:15.960> to<00:01:16.049> be<00:01:16.200> to<00:01:16.439> just<00:01:16.650> go<00:01:16.770> ahead<00:01:16.920> and<00:01:17.250> remove

00:01:17.649 --> 00:01:17.659 
going to be to just go ahead and remove

00:01:17.659 --> 00:01:22.539 
going to be to just go ahead and remove
these<00:01:18.659> side<00:01:18.990> corners<00:01:19.439> here<00:01:20.930> go<00:01:21.930> ahead<00:01:22.080> and

00:01:22.539 --> 00:01:22.549 
these side corners here go ahead and

00:01:22.549 --> 00:01:25.039 
these side corners here go ahead and
looks<00:01:23.549> like<00:01:23.700> there's<00:01:23.850> about<00:01:24.030> three<00:01:24.540> screws<00:01:25.020> on

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:25.049 
looks like there's about three screws on

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:47.780 
looks like there's about three screws on
this<00:01:25.380> side<00:01:28.909> go<00:01:29.909> ahead<00:01:29.939> and<00:01:30.180> get<00:01:30.360> these<00:01:30.540> out

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:47.790 

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:49.760 

and<00:01:48.270> by<00:01:48.390> the<00:01:48.450> way<00:01:48.540> this<00:01:48.720> is<00:01:48.900> already<00:01:49.230> a<00:01:49.260> broken

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770 
and by the way this is already a broken

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:52.340 
and by the way this is already a broken
screen<00:01:50.070> so<00:01:50.580> I'm<00:01:51.570> not<00:01:51.660> really<00:01:51.870> being<00:01:52.080> too

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350 
screen so I'm not really being too

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:55.010 
screen so I'm not really being too
cautious<00:01:52.710> with<00:01:53.160> it<00:01:53.370> of<00:01:54.210> course<00:01:54.420> if<00:01:54.570> it's<00:01:54.690> not

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020 
cautious with it of course if it's not

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:56.900 
cautious with it of course if it's not
damaged<00:01:55.830> or<00:01:56.070> it's<00:01:56.220> not<00:01:56.430> something<00:01:56.790> it's

00:01:56.900 --> 00:01:56.910 
damaged or it's not something it's

00:01:56.910 --> 00:01:57.710 
damaged or it's not something it's
something<00:01:57.180> that<00:01:57.270> you're<00:01:57.390> going<00:01:57.480> to<00:01:57.540> want<00:01:57.690> to

00:01:57.710 --> 00:01:57.720 
something that you're going to want to

00:01:57.720 --> 00:01:59.000 
something that you're going to want to
put<00:01:57.900> back<00:01:58.050> in<00:01:58.200> now<00:01:58.320> you're<00:01:58.530> gonna<00:01:58.650> want<00:01:58.860> to<00:01:58.890> be

00:01:59.000 --> 00:01:59.010 
put back in now you're gonna want to be

00:01:59.010 --> 00:02:00.320 
put back in now you're gonna want to be
a<00:01:59.040> little<00:01:59.250> bit<00:01:59.400> easier<00:01:59.430> than<00:01:59.760> what<00:01:59.940> I<00:02:00.030> am<00:02:00.180> with

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:00.330 
a little bit easier than what I am with

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:05.140 
a little bit easier than what I am with
this<00:02:01.190> go<00:02:02.190> ahead<00:02:02.340> and<00:02:02.460> turn<00:02:02.850> this<00:02:03.030> around<00:02:03.090> here

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:05.150 
this go ahead and turn this around here

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:08.420 
this go ahead and turn this around here
see<00:02:06.150> it's<00:02:06.390> about<00:02:06.570> three<00:02:07.050> screws<00:02:07.620> right<00:02:08.010> here

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:08.430 
see it's about three screws right here

00:02:08.430 --> 00:02:12.530 
see it's about three screws right here
on<00:02:09.030> the<00:02:09.240> corner<00:02:09.480> you<00:02:10.470> have<00:02:11.150> one<00:02:12.150> here<00:02:12.360> at<00:02:12.450> the

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:12.540 
on the corner you have one here at the

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:15.080 
on the corner you have one here at the
top<00:02:13.010> one<00:02:14.010> down<00:02:14.190> here<00:02:14.490> and<00:02:14.610> one<00:02:14.730> down<00:02:14.910> at<00:02:15.030> the

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:15.090 
top one down here and one down at the

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:16.520 
top one down here and one down at the
bottom<00:02:15.450> as<00:02:15.570> well<00:02:15.750> it's<00:02:15.960> identical<00:02:16.410> on<00:02:16.470> the

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:16.530 
bottom as well it's identical on the

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:18.920 
bottom as well it's identical on the
other<00:02:16.680> side<00:02:16.970> what<00:02:17.970> that<00:02:18.120> is<00:02:18.240> is<00:02:18.390> it<00:02:18.540> holds<00:02:18.810> this

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:18.930 
other side what that is is it holds this

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:22.520 
other side what that is is it holds this
frame<00:02:19.380> to<00:02:19.710> keep<00:02:20.490> the<00:02:20.610> laptop<00:02:20.820> supported<00:02:21.600> from

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:22.530 
frame to keep the laptop supported from

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:25.370 
frame to keep the laptop supported from
this<00:02:22.680> hinge<00:02:22.950> down<00:02:23.220> here<00:02:23.520> so<00:02:23.990> just<00:02:24.990> get<00:02:25.200> that

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:25.380 
this hinge down here so just get that
