00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:04.379
 hello friends today I 'm going to teach you 

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:08.700
 make a crepe paper flower as is 

00:00:04.379 --> 00:00:11.340
 well let's see how it is done 

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:13.590
 The materials that we are going to use are 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:16.139
 four rectangles of crepe paper 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:19.410
 color of the petal that wish a 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:21.660
 color box of the pistil paper 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:24.900
 green color 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:27.779
 a very thin wand preferably if 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:31.430
 they have the skewer they can use and 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:34.390
 if not then a twig that is thin 

00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:36.460
 glue and scissors 

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:40.829
 with the rectangles that will be ours 

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:40.829
 petals let's accommodate the 

00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:51.040
 this way we doubled in half 

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:53.500
 and then we will take our 

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:57.880
 scissors and what we're going to do is cut 

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:59.810
 in the form of a triangle from the center to the 

00:00:57.880 --> 00:01:02.060
 corner 

00:00:59.810 --> 00:01:05.050
 we flipped 

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:05.050
 and we cut 

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:12.990
 well in this way in such a way that 

00:01:10.479 --> 00:01:12.990
 when we talk 

00:01:13.159 --> 00:01:19.840
 we already have some diamonds 

00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:24.220
 to shape the petal we take a 

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:27.640
 rhombus and what we are going to do is fold or 

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:31.440
 roll on the side 

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:31.440
 longer in this way 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:37.110
 all right 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:40.450
 and then to tie what 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:42.340
 let's do is go for a spin 

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:45.250
 and we opened 

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:48.420
 in this way we will do the same 

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:52.780
 procedure with the other three diamonds 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:55.080
 we do the last scrubbing or wrinkling 

00:01:52.780 --> 00:02:00.590
 thus 

00:01:55.080 --> 00:02:00.590
 and to moor, we give it a spin 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:07.439
 Well, we're finished because they are our 

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:11.460
 four petals with the rectangle 

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:13.620
 yellow let's cut in half 

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:17.150
 and one half what we are going to do is 

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:17.150
 make a little ball 

00:02:18.069 --> 00:02:24.160
 well in this way 

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:27.400
 we put it in the middle of the other half and 

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:30.480
 we take our stick putting him a 

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:30.480
 little glue 

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:39.410
 we arrange the ball over the pole and 

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:42.370
 we roll the other half 

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:42.370
 by the stick 

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:47.600
 we put a little glue 

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:57.750
 well and we assure it very well 

00:02:54.910 --> 00:03:00.720
 let's wait for it to dry 

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:03.480
 once dry the next step is 

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:05.750
 add the petals by putting a little 

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:08.460
 glue under the ball 

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:10.590
 we take a petal and what we are going to do 

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:14.910
 is to drill 

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:18.020
 with the stick very carefully 

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:18.020
 we upload it 

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:26.790
 and we arrange it 

00:03:24.069 --> 00:03:26.790
 carefully 

00:03:31.569 --> 00:03:36.480
 well in this way 

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:39.739
 and so 

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:43.700
 we will be putting the other petals 

00:03:39.739 --> 00:03:43.700
 we put another bit of glue 

00:03:43.819 --> 00:03:52.770
 and we take another petal drilling it 

00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:52.770
 and taking it to the top 

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:59.810
 well and once put all the petals 

00:03:56.390 --> 00:04:02.500
 will remain this way 

00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:05.300
 finally we take our crepe paper 

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:09.050
 what we are going to do is cut a strip 

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:11.410
 about 2 centimeters of 

00:04:09.050 --> 00:04:11.410
 width 

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:20.549
 well and so we already have this strip 

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:22.320
 let's make glue to the base of our 

00:04:20.549 --> 00:04:25.820
 flower 

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:25.820
 we stick the tip 

00:04:28.729 --> 00:04:35.680
 and we started to roll down the strip 

00:04:32.689 --> 00:04:35.680
 thus 

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:41.520
 when we get to the middle we put it 

00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:45.050
 another bit of glue and we continue 

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:45.050
 rolling to the end 

00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:50.839
 well when we get to the end 

00:04:48.529 --> 00:04:52.610
 what we are going to do is put glue 

00:04:50.839 --> 00:04:55.629
 to the stick 

00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:55.629
 and we roll up 

00:04:56.849 --> 00:05:06.900
 in this way we put glue 

00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:06.900
 and we cut our strip to finish 

00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:16.330
 in this way well and finally we have 

00:05:10.850 --> 00:05:17.979
 finished our crepe paper flower 

00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:20.470
