so<00:04:08.680> these<00:04:08.950> strokes<00:04:09.370> will<00:04:09.790> be<00:04:09.910> darkened<00:04:10.420> by<00:04:10.570> the

wrist to achieve these narrowing brush
strokes<00:04:16.720> I'll<00:04:18.000> switch<00:04:19.000> colors<00:04:19.030> and<00:04:19.750> continue

on the Owls chest then add a bit of

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:33.600 
on the Owls chest then add a bit of
shadow<00:04:24.130> around<00:04:24.760> the<00:04:24.940> edges<00:04:31.919> I'll<00:04:32.919> duplicate

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:33.610 
shadow around the edges I'll duplicate

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:36.450 
shadow around the edges I'll duplicate
our<00:04:33.669> ink<00:04:34.120> layer<00:04:34.390> and<00:04:34.800> change<00:04:35.800> its<00:04:36.070> blend<00:04:36.340> mode

00:04:36.450 --> 00:04:36.460

I<00:04:38.160> like<00:04:39.160> this<00:04:39.310> darkness<00:04:39.700> better<00:04:40.060> but<00:04:40.960> just<00:04:41.290> for

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:41.530 
I like this darkness better but just for

00:04:41.530 --> 00:04:45.240 
I like this darkness better but just for
the<00:04:41.620> owl<00:04:41.800> to<00:04:42.280> make<00:04:42.460> it<00:04:42.610> stand<00:04:42.880> out<00:04:43.830> I'll<00:04:44.830> switch

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:45.250 
the owl to make it stand out I'll switch

00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:47.460 
the owl to make it stand out I'll switch
to<00:04:45.280> the<00:04:45.520> eraser<00:04:45.940> and<00:04:46.360> get<00:04:46.660> rid<00:04:46.870> of<00:04:46.900> everything

00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:47.470 
to the eraser and get rid of everything

00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:53.050 
to the eraser and get rid of everything
but<00:04:47.830> the<00:04:47.890> owl<00:04:48.190> on<00:04:48.520> this<00:04:48.820> layer

00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:53.060 

00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:56.450 

one<00:04:54.060> more<00:04:54.330> layer<00:04:54.590> will<00:04:55.590> add<00:04:55.770> a<00:04:55.830> little<00:04:56.160> white

00:04:56.450 --> 00:04:56.460 
one more layer will add a little white

00:04:56.460 --> 00:05:01.520 
one more layer will add a little white
to<00:04:56.490> the<00:04:56.849> eyes<00:04:59.150> with<00:05:00.150> that<00:05:00.389> bit<00:05:00.660> of<00:05:00.690> highlight<00:05:01.289> I

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:01.530 
to the eyes with that bit of highlight I

00:05:01.530 --> 00:05:04.460 
to the eyes with that bit of highlight I
think<00:05:02.039> we're<00:05:02.190> done<00:05:02.370> I<00:05:02.780> hope<00:05:03.780> this<00:05:03.960> video<00:05:04.139> was

00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:04.470 
think we're done I hope this video was

00:05:04.470 --> 00:05:08.599 
think we're done I hope this video was
helpful<00:05:04.759> thanks<00:05:05.759> so<00:05:05.910> much<00:05:05.940> for<00:05:06.419> watching
