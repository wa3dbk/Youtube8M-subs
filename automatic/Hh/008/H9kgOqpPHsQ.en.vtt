don't know not a flying toy but and then
on<00:00:51.449> the<00:00:51.510> bottom<00:00:51.600> need<00:00:51.899> a<00:00:51.930> little<00:00:52.110> in<00:00:52.559> shows<00:00:52.890> all

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
on the bottom need a little in shows all

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:54.860 
on the bottom need a little in shows all
of<00:00:53.129> them<00:00:53.430> and<00:00:53.670> then<00:00:54.120> it<00:00:54.210> shows<00:00:54.449> you<00:00:54.480> how<00:00:54.840> the

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870 
of them and then it shows you how the

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:56.959 
of them and then it shows you how the
transformation<00:00:55.469> works<00:00:55.890> so<00:00:56.219> yeah<00:00:56.430> pretty

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
transformation works so yeah pretty

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:58.700 
transformation works so yeah pretty
typical<00:00:57.239> stuff<00:00:57.629> I<00:00:57.809> do<00:00:57.870> like<00:00:58.199> the<00:00:58.320> packaging

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
typical stuff I do like the packaging

00:00:58.710 --> 00:00:59.750 
typical stuff I do like the packaging
for<00:00:58.859> those<00:00:59.010> I<00:00:59.129> think<00:00:59.160> it's<00:00:59.370> kind<00:00:59.550> of<00:00:59.579> neat<00:00:59.730> to

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
for those I think it's kind of neat to

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:01.990 
for those I think it's kind of neat to
give<00:01:00.000> them<00:01:00.180> a<00:01:00.359> little<00:01:00.690> bit<00:01:00.899> of<00:01:01.050> a<00:01:01.140> premium<00:01:01.500> vibe

00:01:01.990 --> 00:01:02.000 
give them a little bit of a premium vibe

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.009 
give them a little bit of a premium vibe
obviously<00:01:03.000> what<00:01:03.239> comes<00:01:03.449> with<00:01:03.570> it<00:01:03.629> is<00:01:03.870> this

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
obviously what comes with it is this

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:05.960 
obviously what comes with it is this
figure<00:01:04.229> here<00:01:04.650> which<00:01:04.890> is<00:01:05.189> the<00:01:05.309> base<00:01:05.460> and<00:01:05.820> then

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
figure here which is the base and then

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:08.570 
figure here which is the base and then
you<00:01:06.060> get<00:01:06.240> to<00:01:06.390> the<00:01:06.570> Kurumi<00:01:07.350> arms<00:01:07.619> here<00:01:07.950> and<00:01:08.100> then

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
you get to the Kurumi arms here and then

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:10.789 
you get to the Kurumi arms here and then
his<00:01:08.790> knuckles<00:01:09.360> which<00:01:10.020> are<00:01:10.170> his<00:01:10.320> main<00:01:10.530> feature

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799 
his knuckles which are his main feature

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:12.770 
his knuckles which are his main feature
weapon<00:01:11.640> and<00:01:11.850> you<00:01:11.909> can<00:01:12.060> put<00:01:12.210> them<00:01:12.360> on<00:01:12.450> any<00:01:12.689> other

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
weapon and you can put them on any other

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:14.300 
weapon and you can put them on any other
rider<00:01:13.049> which<00:01:13.290> is<00:01:13.409> cool<00:01:13.650> I<00:01:13.860> think<00:01:14.040> which<00:01:14.280> makes

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310 
rider which is cool I think which makes

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:15.890 
rider which is cool I think which makes
sense<00:01:14.640> cuz<00:01:14.909> like<00:01:15.060> you<00:01:15.240> want<00:01:15.420> me<00:01:15.509> to<00:01:15.570> be<00:01:15.630> able<00:01:15.689> to

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:15.900 
sense cuz like you want me to be able to

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:17.899 
sense cuz like you want me to be able to
use<00:01:16.049> it<00:01:16.200> but<00:01:16.380> it's<00:01:16.530> cool<00:01:16.710> to<00:01:17.009> even<00:01:17.670> have<00:01:17.759> like

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909 
use it but it's cool to even have like

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:19.910 
use it but it's cool to even have like
another<00:01:18.180> further<00:01:18.780> level<00:01:19.229> of<00:01:19.320> playability

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
another further level of playability

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:21.560 
another further level of playability
you<00:01:19.979> could<00:01:20.130> put<00:01:20.310> like<00:01:20.460> I<00:01:20.700> don't<00:01:21.150> know<00:01:21.210> melon

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
you could put like I don't know melon

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:23.240 
you could put like I don't know melon
arms<00:01:21.840> on<00:01:21.990> Bravo<00:01:22.409> and<00:01:22.560> then<00:01:22.650> give<00:01:22.860> him<00:01:22.950> the

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
arms on Bravo and then give him the

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:25.880 
arms on Bravo and then give him the
knuckle<00:01:23.820> fist<00:01:24.119> if<00:01:24.270> you<00:01:24.360> wanted<00:01:24.570> to<00:01:24.720> but<00:01:25.619> anyway

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
knuckle fist if you wanted to but anyway

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:27.350 
knuckle fist if you wanted to but anyway
the<00:01:26.340> base<00:01:26.490> figure<00:01:26.759> itself<00:01:26.939> pretty<00:01:27.210> typical

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360 
the base figure itself pretty typical

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:28.819 
the base figure itself pretty typical
fare<00:01:27.750> as<00:01:27.900> you<00:01:27.990> can<00:01:28.110> see<00:01:28.229> on<00:01:28.380> its<00:01:28.530> own<00:01:28.650> he's

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:28.829 
fare as you can see on its own he's

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:30.770 
fare as you can see on its own he's
pretty<00:01:29.189> basic<00:01:29.909> there's<00:01:30.329> really<00:01:30.420> not<00:01:30.600> a<00:01:30.659> whole

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 
pretty basic there's really not a whole

little<00:02:04.020> ball<00:02:04.140> joint<00:02:04.350> on<00:02:04.409> this<00:02:04.560> foot<00:02:04.770> I<00:02:05.689> always

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:06.689 
little ball joint on this foot I always

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:07.819 
little ball joint on this foot I always
say<00:02:06.840> that<00:02:07.020> in<00:02:07.079> these<00:02:07.200> reviews<00:02:07.530> but<00:02:07.770> the

00:02:07.819 --> 00:02:07.829 
say that in these reviews but the

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:09.680 
say that in these reviews but the
articulation<00:02:08.759> for<00:02:08.910> these<00:02:09.060> figures<00:02:09.330> is<00:02:09.450> pretty

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:09.690 
articulation for these figures is pretty

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:11.750 
articulation for these figures is pretty
much<00:02:09.840> somewhere<00:02:10.140> between<00:02:10.319> a<00:02:10.440> figure<00:02:10.739> and<00:02:11.039> a

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:11.760 
much somewhere between a figure and a

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:12.740 
much somewhere between a figure and a
five-inch<00:02:12.330> power

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:12.750 
five-inch power

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:14.510 
five-inch power
figure<00:02:13.050> so<00:02:13.590> yeah<00:02:13.740> that's<00:02:13.980> pretty<00:02:14.040> much<00:02:14.250> it's

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:14.520 
figure so yeah that's pretty much it's

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:16.730 
figure so yeah that's pretty much it's
pretty<00:02:14.730> much<00:02:15.000> the<00:02:15.150> standard<00:02:15.440> mold<00:02:16.440> you<00:02:16.590> got

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:16.740 
pretty much the standard mold you got

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:18.350 
pretty much the standard mold you got
going<00:02:17.040> there<00:02:17.220> to<00:02:17.610> put<00:02:17.790> it<00:02:17.880> on<00:02:18.030> it's<00:02:18.270> really

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:18.360 
going there to put it on it's really

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:20.150 
going there to put it on it's really
easy<00:02:18.630> it<00:02:19.140> also<00:02:19.290> comes<00:02:19.590> with<00:02:19.680> a<00:02:19.800> little<00:02:19.920> helmet

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:20.160 
easy it also comes with a little helmet

easy it also comes with a little helmet
which<00:02:20.370> I've<00:02:20.490> already<00:02:20.580> snapped<00:02:20.880> in<00:02:21.060> there

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:21.210 
which I've already snapped in there

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:22.550 
which I've already snapped in there
hopefully<00:02:21.540> it<00:02:21.630> stays<00:02:21.810> on<00:02:22.020> sometimes<00:02:22.470> they

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:22.560 
hopefully it stays on sometimes they

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:24.530 
hopefully it stays on sometimes they
don't<00:02:22.650> stay<00:02:22.890> on<00:02:23.070> you<00:02:23.640> just<00:02:23.820> slide<00:02:24.000> it<00:02:24.120> over<00:02:24.240> top

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:46.920 
that back and then you have the base

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:48.920 
that back and then you have the base
Armour<00:02:47.310> there<00:02:47.550> and<00:02:47.850> then<00:02:48.270> for<00:02:48.420> his<00:02:48.510> hands<00:02:48.750> it's

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:48.930

really<00:02:49.140> simple<00:02:49.380> to<00:02:49.560> just<00:02:49.770> open<00:02:50.040> them<00:02:50.160> up<00:02:50.280> and

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:50.700 
really simple to just open them up and

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:53.300 
really simple to just open them up and
there's<00:02:51.060> these<00:02:51.180> little<00:02:51.600> like<00:02:52.110> latches<00:02:53.040> here

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:53.310 
there's these little like latches here

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:55.140 
just open his hands up and you kind of

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:56.990 
just open his hands up and you kind of
just<00:02:55.650> kind<00:02:55.800> of<00:02:55.890> squeeze<00:02:56.190> it<00:02:56.250> down<00:02:56.580> so<00:02:56.880> you<00:02:56.910> can

00:02:56.990 --> 00:02:57.000 
just kind of squeeze it down so you can

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.330 
just kind of squeeze it down so you can
help<00:02:57.300> hold<00:02:57.540> it<00:02:57.720> you<00:02:58.200> have<00:02:58.620> to<00:02:58.739> fiddle<00:02:59.040> with<00:02:59.250> it

00:02:59.330 --> 00:02:59.340 
help hold it you have to fiddle with it

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:00.350 
help hold it you have to fiddle with it
a<00:02:59.430> little<00:02:59.550> bit<00:02:59.670> to<00:02:59.850> get<00:02:59.970> him<00:03:00.060> to<00:03:00.120> hold<00:03:00.270> it

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:00.360 
a little bit to get him to hold it

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:01.970 
a little bit to get him to hold it
really<00:03:00.540> well<00:03:00.660> more<00:03:01.230> often<00:03:01.470> now<00:03:01.620> they<00:03:01.830> end<00:03:01.920> up

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:01.980 
really well more often now they end up

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:03.920 
really well more often now they end up
shaky<00:03:02.280> like<00:03:02.430> that<00:03:02.610> for<00:03:02.820> me<00:03:02.940> because<00:03:03.720> I'm<00:03:03.810> an

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:03.930 
shaky like that for me because I'm an

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:05.870 
shaky like that for me because I'm an
idiot<00:03:04.050> but<00:03:04.560> yeah<00:03:05.340> that's<00:03:05.459> how<00:03:05.610> they<00:03:05.730> go<00:03:05.850> on

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:05.880 
idiot but yeah that's how they go on

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:09.110 
idiot but yeah that's how they go on
pretty<00:03:06.180> easy<00:03:06.450> if<00:03:07.170> you<00:03:07.350> pay<00:03:07.980> or<00:03:08.550> spend<00:03:08.970> more

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:09.120 
pretty easy if you pay or spend more

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:10.640 
pretty easy if you pay or spend more
than<00:03:09.270> like<00:03:09.480> three<00:03:09.660> seconds<00:03:10.200> trying<00:03:10.440> to<00:03:10.500> put

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:10.650 
than like three seconds trying to put

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:12.470 
than like three seconds trying to put
them<00:03:10.739> on<00:03:10.860> you<00:03:11.040> can<00:03:11.190> get<00:03:11.310> him<00:03:11.430> to<00:03:11.459> hold<00:03:12.239> it

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:12.480 
them on you can get him to hold it

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:13.940 
them on you can get him to hold it
pretty<00:03:12.750> well<00:03:12.930> where<00:03:13.410> I've<00:03:13.470> had<00:03:13.650> him<00:03:13.770> pretty

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:13.950 
pretty well where I've had him pretty

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:18.800 
pretty well where I've had him pretty
stable<00:03:14.280> there<00:03:15.920> we<00:03:16.920> go<00:03:17.100> and<00:03:17.940> there<00:03:18.330> we<00:03:18.510> have

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:18.810 
stable there we go and there we have

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:22.520 
stable there we go and there we have
knuckle<00:03:19.590> booster<00:03:20.430> knuckle<00:03:21.180> van<00:03:21.360> it's<00:03:21.959> really

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:22.530 
knuckle booster knuckle van it's really

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:24.080 
knuckle booster knuckle van it's really
know<00:03:23.040> I<00:03:23.070> said<00:03:23.370> that<00:03:23.400> but<00:03:23.640> yeah<00:03:23.760> I<00:03:23.790> think<00:03:23.880> it

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:24.090 
know I said that but yeah I think it

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:25.520 
know I said that but yeah I think it
looks<00:03:24.209> pretty<00:03:24.299> good<00:03:24.450> with<00:03:24.600> armor<00:03:24.959> I<00:03:24.989> really<00:03:25.410> do

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:25.530 
looks pretty good with armor I really do

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:27.530 
looks pretty good with armor I really do
dig<00:03:25.739> knuckles<00:03:26.640> design<00:03:26.970> and<00:03:27.180> I<00:03:27.209> really<00:03:27.420> like

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:27.540 
dig knuckles design and I really like

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:28.880 
dig knuckles design and I really like
Zack<00:03:27.780> as<00:03:27.930> a<00:03:27.989> character<00:03:28.350> so<00:03:28.440> it's<00:03:28.560> really<00:03:28.769> nice

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:28.890 
Zack as a character so it's really nice

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:30.800 
Zack as a character so it's really nice
to<00:03:28.920> have<00:03:29.100> him<00:03:29.280> so<00:03:30.180> I<00:03:30.209> think<00:03:30.420> he<00:03:30.510> looks<00:03:30.660> pretty

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:30.810 
to have him so I think he looks pretty

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:32.900 
to have him so I think he looks pretty
solid<00:03:31.140> I'm<00:03:31.560> sure<00:03:32.160> the<00:03:32.280> figure<00:03:32.610> will<00:03:32.790> look

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:32.910 
solid I'm sure the figure will look

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:35.780 
solid I'm sure the figure will look
better<00:03:33.120> especially<00:03:33.840> since<00:03:34.220> his<00:03:35.220> gloves<00:03:35.549> just

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:35.790 
better especially since his gloves just

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:37.340 
better especially since his gloves just
fall<00:03:36.030> off<00:03:36.209> and<00:03:36.390> the<00:03:36.450> figures<00:03:36.720> will<00:03:37.019> stay<00:03:37.200> on

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:37.350 
fall off and the figures will stay on

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:40.340 
fall off and the figures will stay on
but<00:03:38.340> since<00:03:38.610> the<00:03:38.910> gun<00:03:39.150> figures<00:03:39.630> have<00:03:40.049> been<00:03:40.200> so

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:40.350 
but since the gun figures have been so

00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:43.729 
but since the gun figures have been so
excellent<00:03:40.880> but<00:03:41.880> I<00:03:42.120> have<00:03:42.750> said<00:03:42.959> it<00:03:43.079> before<00:03:43.200> but

00:03:43.729 --> 00:03:43.739 
excellent but I have said it before but

00:03:43.739 --> 00:03:46.009 
excellent but I have said it before but
the<00:03:43.829> main<00:03:44.150> thing<00:03:45.150> of<00:03:45.299> this<00:03:45.450> line<00:03:45.690> is<00:03:45.870> the

00:03:46.009 --> 00:03:46.019 
the main thing of this line is the

00:03:46.019 --> 00:03:47.449 
the main thing of this line is the
playability<00:03:46.470> which<00:03:46.799> you<00:03:46.920> just<00:03:47.100> don't<00:03:47.310> get

00:03:47.449 --> 00:03:47.459 
playability which you just don't get

00:03:47.459 --> 00:03:49.819 
playability which you just don't get
with<00:03:47.640> the<00:03:47.730> figure<00:03:48.060> it's<00:03:48.209> the<00:03:48.660> ability<00:03:48.989> to<00:03:49.019> do

00:03:49.819 --> 00:03:49.829 
with the figure it's the ability to do

00:03:49.829 --> 00:03:51.350 
with the figure it's the ability to do
arm<00:03:50.040> changes<00:03:50.459> that<00:03:50.610> were<00:03:50.670> in<00:03:50.820> the<00:03:50.970> show<00:03:51.180> or

00:03:51.350 --> 00:03:51.360 
arm changes that were in the show or

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:53.330 
arm changes that were in the show or
weren't<00:03:51.630> in<00:03:51.720> the<00:03:51.810> show<00:03:52.019> which<00:03:52.620> is<00:03:52.769> really<00:03:53.310> a

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:53.340 
weren't in the show which is really a

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:55.640 
weren't in the show which is really a
lot<00:03:53.549> of<00:03:53.670> fun<00:03:53.880> and<00:03:54.090> even<00:03:54.660> without<00:03:55.049> that<00:03:55.290> I<00:03:55.320> still

00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:55.650 
lot of fun and even without that I still

00:03:55.650 --> 00:03:56.780 
lot of fun and even without that I still
think<00:03:55.829> they're<00:03:55.950> pretty<00:03:56.100> decent<00:03:56.549> looking

00:03:56.780 --> 00:03:56.790 
think they're pretty decent looking

00:03:56.790 --> 00:03:58.940 
think they're pretty decent looking
figures<00:03:57.209> I<00:03:57.329> mean<00:03:57.450> they're<00:03:57.600> hardly<00:03:57.959> terrible

00:03:58.940 --> 00:03:58.950 
figures I mean they're hardly terrible

00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:02.630 
figures I mean they're hardly terrible
or<00:03:59.070> anything<00:03:59.280> like<00:03:59.670> that<00:04:00.920> the<00:04:01.920> only<00:04:02.250> real

00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:02.640 
or anything like that the only real

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:04.610 
or anything like that the only real
difference<00:04:03.299> in<00:04:03.600> the<00:04:03.660> articulation<00:04:04.260> comes<00:04:04.470> in

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:04.620 
difference in the articulation comes in

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:05.870 
difference in the articulation comes in
the<00:04:04.680> fact<00:04:04.890> that<00:04:04.980> his<00:04:05.160> shoulders<00:04:05.430> are<00:04:05.730> quite

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:05.880 
the fact that his shoulders are quite

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:07.610 
the fact that his shoulders are quite
big<00:04:06.120> and<00:04:06.600> you<00:04:06.690> have<00:04:06.780> to<00:04:06.870> do<00:04:06.989> some<00:04:07.170> maneuvering

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:07.620 
big and you have to do some maneuvering

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:09.620 
big and you have to do some maneuvering
around<00:04:07.680> it<00:04:08.040> it<00:04:08.190> does<00:04:08.430> hinder<00:04:09.120> his<00:04:09.299> shoulder

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:09.630 
around it it does hinder his shoulder

00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:10.970 
around it it does hinder his shoulder
articulation<00:04:10.200> of<00:04:10.290> bed<00:04:10.470> now<00:04:10.620> that<00:04:10.769> he<00:04:10.829> has

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:10.980 
articulation of bed now that he has

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:12.890 
articulation of bed now that he has
those<00:04:11.220> on<00:04:11.400> and<00:04:11.670> then<00:04:12.060> he's<00:04:12.180> got<00:04:12.329> his<00:04:12.360> fingers

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:12.900 
those on and then he's got his fingers

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:14.630 
those on and then he's got his fingers
fingers<00:04:13.230> his<00:04:13.440> fist<00:04:13.680> to<00:04:13.769> work<00:04:13.950> with<00:04:14.100> as<00:04:14.250> well<00:04:14.280> so

00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:14.640 
fingers his fist to work with as well so

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:17.240 
fingers his fist to work with as well so
he<00:04:14.730> is<00:04:14.820> a<00:04:14.850> bit<00:04:15.150> more<00:04:15.299> hindered<00:04:15.989> now<00:04:16.200> but<00:04:16.560> beyond

00:04:17.240 --> 00:04:17.250 
he is a bit more hindered now but beyond

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:18.620 
he is a bit more hindered now but beyond
that<00:04:17.370> I<00:04:17.790> think<00:04:18.150> he's<00:04:18.239> pretty<00:04:18.390> good<00:04:18.600> looking

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:18.630 
that I think he's pretty good looking

00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:21.140 
that I think he's pretty good looking
and<00:04:19.049> it's<00:04:19.859> another<00:04:20.070> good<00:04:20.310> arm<00:04:20.549> change<00:04:20.849> figure

00:04:21.140 --> 00:04:21.150 
and it's another good arm change figure

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:22.490 
and it's another good arm change figure
gives<00:04:21.419> you<00:04:21.510> a<00:04:21.539> lot<00:04:21.660> of<00:04:21.690> our<00:04:21.810> combinations<00:04:22.320> he's

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:22.500 
gives you a lot of our combinations he's

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:23.839 
gives you a lot of our combinations he's
me<00:04:22.590> falling<00:04:22.890> I<00:04:22.979> thought<00:04:23.220> he's<00:04:23.340> falling<00:04:23.640> for<00:04:23.669> a

00:04:23.839 --> 00:04:23.849 
me falling I thought he's falling for a

00:04:23.849 --> 00:04:25.070 
me falling I thought he's falling for a
second

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:25.080 
second

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:28.770 
second
but<00:04:26.080> yeah<00:04:26.230> I<00:04:26.590> really<00:04:27.070> do<00:04:27.460> dig<00:04:27.640> the<00:04:27.760> figure<00:04:28.060> so

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:28.780 
but yeah I really do dig the figure so

00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:30.150 
but yeah I really do dig the figure so
if<00:04:29.020> you're<00:04:29.200> you've<00:04:29.560> been<00:04:29.680> collecting<00:04:30.010> arm

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:30.160 
if you're you've been collecting arm

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:31.410 
if you're you've been collecting arm
change<00:04:30.430> figures<00:04:30.790> I<00:04:30.970> can<00:04:31.300> definitely

00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:31.420 
change figures I can definitely

00:04:31.420 --> 00:04:32.970 
change figures I can definitely
recommend<00:04:31.690> em<00:04:32.110> he's<00:04:32.260> gonna<00:04:32.350> add<00:04:32.560> another<00:04:32.650> one

00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:32.980 
recommend em he's gonna add another one

00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:34.500 
recommend em he's gonna add another one
to<00:04:33.010> your<00:04:33.220> collection<00:04:33.370> what<00:04:34.120> I<00:04:34.150> like<00:04:34.390> in

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:34.510

00:04:34.510 --> 00:04:35.850 
to your collection what I like in
particular<00:04:34.600> about<00:04:35.020> this<00:04:35.170> one<00:04:35.350> as<00:04:35.440> I<00:04:35.560> said<00:04:35.590> at

00:04:35.850 --> 00:04:35.860 
particular about this one as I said at

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:37.800 
particular about this one as I said at
the<00:04:35.890> beginning<00:04:36.070> is<00:04:36.460> that<00:04:36.490> he's<00:04:36.700> got<00:04:36.850> the<00:04:37.150> fist

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:37.810 
the beginning is that he's got the fist

00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:39.240 
the beginning is that he's got the fist
weapons<00:04:38.170> that<00:04:38.320> you<00:04:38.380> can<00:04:38.530> also<00:04:38.710> switch<00:04:39.040> out

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:39.250 
weapons that you can also switch out

00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:41.730 
weapons that you can also switch out
with<00:04:39.400> other<00:04:39.550> figures<00:04:40.050> without<00:04:41.050> using<00:04:41.560> the

00:04:41.730 --> 00:04:41.740 
with other figures without using the

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:43.830 
with other figures without using the
armor<00:04:42.160> so<00:04:42.370> you<00:04:42.490> can<00:04:42.910> sort<00:04:43.270> of<00:04:43.300> do<00:04:43.420> more<00:04:43.570> mixing

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:43.840 
armor so you can sort of do more mixing

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:45.780 
armor so you can sort of do more mixing
and<00:04:43.990> matching<00:04:44.110> and<00:04:44.620> obviously<00:04:45.070> do<00:04:45.490> stuff<00:04:45.700> like

00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:45.790 
and matching and obviously do stuff like

00:04:45.790 --> 00:04:47.940 
and matching and obviously do stuff like
give<00:04:46.030> it<00:04:46.120> to<00:04:46.210> kiwami<00:04:46.510> but<00:04:46.930> yeah<00:04:47.560> that's<00:04:47.770> pretty

00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:47.950 
give it to kiwami but yeah that's pretty

00:04:47.950 --> 00:04:49.110 
give it to kiwami but yeah that's pretty
much<00:04:48.070> it<00:04:48.370> I'm<00:04:48.490> not<00:04:48.580> gonna<00:04:48.760> show<00:04:48.910> any<00:04:49.060> other

00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:49.120 
much it I'm not gonna show any other

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:50.880 
much it I'm not gonna show any other
combinations<00:04:49.780> at<00:04:49.960> this<00:04:50.080> moment<00:04:50.230> I<00:04:50.410> still<00:04:50.470> plan

00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:50.890 
combinations at this moment I still plan

00:04:50.890 --> 00:04:53.490 
combinations at this moment I still plan
on<00:04:50.920> doing<00:04:51.400> that<00:04:51.570> hopefully<00:04:52.570> if<00:04:53.110> I<00:04:53.200> have<00:04:53.320> time

00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:53.500 
on doing that hopefully if I have time

00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:56.070 
on doing that hopefully if I have time
that<00:04:53.530> giant<00:04:54.100> video<00:04:54.220> that<00:04:54.610> shows<00:04:54.820> like<00:04:55.000> all<00:04:55.840> or

00:04:56.070 --> 00:04:56.080 
that giant video that shows like all or

00:04:56.080 --> 00:04:57.570 
that giant video that shows like all or
most<00:04:56.290> of<00:04:56.470> the<00:04:56.530> combinations<00:04:57.070> once<00:04:57.250> all<00:04:57.430> the

00:04:57.570 --> 00:04:57.580 
most of the combinations once all the

00:04:57.580 --> 00:04:59.280 
most of the combinations once all the
arm<00:04:57.700> change<00:04:57.940> figures<00:04:58.270> are<00:04:58.390> out<00:04:58.510> I<00:04:58.810> think

00:04:59.280 --> 00:04:59.290 
arm change figures are out I think

00:04:59.290 --> 00:05:03.620 
arm change figures are out I think
there's<00:04:59.560> only<00:04:59.650> like<00:05:00.220> one<00:05:00.580> more<00:05:00.850> I<00:05:00.880> think<00:05:02.430> the

00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:03.630 
there's only like one more I think the

00:05:03.630 --> 00:05:08.100 
there's only like one more I think the
was<00:05:04.630> amici's<00:05:06.120> Yoyogi<00:05:07.120> bear<00:05:07.300> arms<00:05:07.660> and<00:05:07.930> then

00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:08.110 
was amici's Yoyogi bear arms and then

00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:10.560 
was amici's Yoyogi bear arms and then
there's<00:05:08.530> gonna<00:05:08.680> be<00:05:08.860> a<00:05:08.890> drive<00:05:09.640> or<00:05:10.000> a<00:05:10.030> game<00:05:10.240> drive

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:10.570 
there's gonna be a drive or a game drive

00:05:10.570 --> 00:05:12.930 
there's gonna be a drive or a game drive
arms<00:05:10.900> and<00:05:10.990> then<00:05:11.080> I<00:05:11.140> think<00:05:11.350> that's<00:05:11.500> it<00:05:11.940> but

00:05:12.930 --> 00:05:12.940 
arms and then I think that's it but

00:05:12.940 --> 00:05:14.160 
arms and then I think that's it but
anyway<00:05:13.180> that's<00:05:13.300> about<00:05:13.450> it<00:05:13.660> for<00:05:13.780> this<00:05:13.900> review

00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:14.170 
anyway that's about it for this review

anyway that's about it for this review
