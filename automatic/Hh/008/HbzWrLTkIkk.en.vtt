hooked around the torch this allows the

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:39.950 
hooked around the torch this allows the
torch<00:01:33.299> to<00:01:33.600> fall<00:01:34.460> straight<00:01:35.460> down<00:01:38.690> which<00:01:39.690> keeps

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
torch to fall straight down which keeps

one of the great things about torch boy
obviously<00:03:04.480> you<00:03:04.569> can<00:03:04.720> play<00:03:04.900> them<00:03:05.140> this<00:03:05.260> point

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:05.560 
obviously you can play them this point

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:09.949 
obviously you can play them this point
and<00:03:06.270> then<00:03:07.270> you<00:03:08.050> can<00:03:08.200> play<00:03:08.410> with<00:03:08.500> them<00:03:08.650> as

00:03:09.949 --> 00:03:09.959 
and then you can play with them as

00:03:09.959 --> 00:03:13.199 
and then you can play with them as
torches<00:03:10.959> but<00:03:11.890> it's<00:03:12.040> getting<00:03:12.220> them<00:03:12.550> from<00:03:13.000> the

00:03:13.199 --> 00:03:13.209 
torches but it's getting them from the

00:03:13.209 --> 00:03:15.150 
torches but it's getting them from the
swinging<00:03:13.599> part<00:03:13.840> to<00:03:14.110> the<00:03:14.319> actual<00:03:14.560> torch<00:03:14.890> part

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:15.160 
swinging part to the actual torch part

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:17.670 
swinging part to the actual torch part
which<00:03:15.310> is<00:03:15.459> a<00:03:15.489> lot<00:03:15.940> of<00:03:16.180> fun<00:03:16.360> my<00:03:17.200> favorite<00:03:17.560> part

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:17.680 
which is a lot of fun my favorite part

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:21.449 
which is a lot of fun my favorite part
of<00:03:17.950> them<00:03:18.730> in<00:03:18.880> fact<00:03:19.230> so<00:03:20.230> catches<00:03:20.860> how<00:03:21.100> do<00:03:21.160> we<00:03:21.310> go

00:03:21.449 --> 00:03:21.459 
of them in fact so catches how do we go

00:03:21.459 --> 00:03:22.979 
of them in fact so catches how do we go
from<00:03:21.640> here<00:03:21.730> to<00:03:22.000> getting<00:03:22.390> them<00:03:22.510> in<00:03:22.660> your<00:03:22.750> hands

00:03:22.979 --> 00:03:22.989 
from here to getting them in your hands

00:03:22.989 --> 00:03:27.900 
from here to getting them in your hands
well<00:03:23.200> the<00:03:23.380> most<00:03:23.560> simple<00:03:23.980> way<00:03:24.100> is<00:03:24.340> this<00:03:26.280> if<00:03:27.280> we

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:27.910 
well the most simple way is this if we

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:31.350 
well the most simple way is this if we
simply<00:03:28.390> pull<00:03:29.080> our<00:03:29.380> hands<00:03:29.830> back<00:03:30.550> in<00:03:30.790> towards<00:03:30.819> us

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:31.360 
simply pull our hands back in towards us

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:35.690 
simply pull our hands back in towards us
upwards<00:03:33.510> it'll<00:03:34.510> cause<00:03:34.720> the<00:03:35.080> torch<00:03:35.350> point

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:35.700 
upwards it'll cause the torch point

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:38.550 
upwards it'll cause the torch point
handle<00:03:36.700> to<00:03:37.569> just<00:03:37.750> want<00:03:37.930> to<00:03:38.019> fall<00:03:38.200> into<00:03:38.380> your

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:30.970 
straight back and what this will make

00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:34.860 
straight back and what this will make
the<00:04:31.150> torch<00:04:31.419> point<00:04:31.750> do<00:04:31.990> is<00:04:32.700> it<00:04:33.700> will<00:04:33.910> fold<00:04:34.270> in<00:04:34.600> on

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:34.870 
the torch point do is it will fold in on

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:37.050 
the torch point do is it will fold in on
itself<00:04:34.930> so<00:04:35.890> that<00:04:35.919> the<00:04:36.160> top<00:04:36.430> of<00:04:36.610> the<00:04:36.729> handle

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:37.060 
itself so that the top of the handle

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:39.540 
itself so that the top of the handle
face<00:04:37.270> is<00:04:37.510> the<00:04:37.600> sky<00:04:37.900> and<00:04:38.260> you'll<00:04:38.950> catch<00:04:39.190> it<00:04:39.220> like
