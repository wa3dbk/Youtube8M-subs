00:00:04.579 --> 00:00:04.589 
alright guys we are back with my updated

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:07.160 
alright guys we are back with my updated
sorting<00:00:05.160> machine<00:00:05.549> so<00:00:06.029> this<00:00:06.150> thing<00:00:06.420> is<00:00:06.569> updated

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:07.170 
sorting machine so this thing is updated

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:09.470 
sorting machine so this thing is updated
to<00:00:07.500> 1.5<00:00:08.309> which<00:00:08.700> means<00:00:08.940> that<00:00:09.090> it<00:00:09.179> should<00:00:09.210> be

00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:09.480 
to 1.5 which means that it should be

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:11.690 
to 1.5 which means that it should be
working<00:00:09.660> screen<00:00:10.380> drop<00:00:10.590> which<00:00:11.309> means<00:00:11.490> that<00:00:11.639> it

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:11.700 
working screen drop which means that it

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:13.640 
working screen drop which means that it
should<00:00:11.730> be<00:00:11.910> working<00:00:12.090> in<00:00:12.420> any<00:00:12.900> version<00:00:13.440> after

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:13.650 
should be working in any version after

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:16.099 
should be working in any version after
this<00:00:13.980> unless<00:00:14.309> any<00:00:14.549> major<00:00:14.820> changes<00:00:15.540> are<00:00:15.809> made

00:00:16.099 --> 00:00:16.109 
this unless any major changes are made

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:18.590 
this unless any major changes are made
to<00:00:16.289> the<00:00:16.320> game<00:00:16.560> and<00:00:17.070> so<00:00:17.910> let's<00:00:18.060> just<00:00:18.270> take<00:00:18.420> a

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:18.600 
to the game and so let's just take a

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:20.240 
to the game and so let's just take a
look<00:00:18.810> at<00:00:18.990> it<00:00:19.109> I've<00:00:19.230> actually<00:00:19.410> had<00:00:19.830> this<00:00:19.949> built

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:20.250 
look at it I've actually had this built

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:22.070 
look at it I've actually had this built
for<00:00:20.490> quite<00:00:20.730> a<00:00:20.760> while<00:00:21.000> I<00:00:21.029> have<00:00:21.330> had<00:00:21.480> a<00:00:21.510> chance<00:00:21.779> to

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:22.080 
for quite a while I have had a chance to

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:23.960 
for quite a while I have had a chance to
sit<00:00:22.289> down<00:00:22.320> and<00:00:22.500> record<00:00:23.100> it<00:00:23.220> but<00:00:23.519> you<00:00:23.880> know

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:23.970 
sit down and record it but you know

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:24.590 
sit down and record it but you know
whatever

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:24.600 
whatever

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:27.080 
whatever
so<00:00:25.590> as<00:00:25.710> you<00:00:25.800> can<00:00:25.949> see<00:00:26.130> here<00:00:26.490> we're<00:00:26.910> actually

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:27.090 
so as you can see here we're actually

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:29.990 
so as you can see here we're actually
using<00:00:27.630> solid<00:00:28.560> state<00:00:28.590> logic<00:00:29.099> now<00:00:29.490> that<00:00:29.820> means

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:30.000 
using solid state logic now that means

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.680 
using solid state logic now that means
no<00:00:30.390> more<00:00:30.630> minecarts<00:00:31.289> or<00:00:31.529> Pistons<00:00:32.450> which<00:00:33.450> makes

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:33.690 
no more minecarts or Pistons which makes

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:36.410 
no more minecarts or Pistons which makes
this<00:00:33.930> thing<00:00:34.260> very<00:00:34.710> reliable<00:00:35.520> and<00:00:35.730> very<00:00:36.000> fast

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:36.420 
this thing very reliable and very fast

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:38.869 
this thing very reliable and very fast
and<00:00:36.870> so<00:00:37.500> anyway<00:00:37.770> let's<00:00:38.010> take<00:00:38.219> a<00:00:38.250> look<00:00:38.489> at<00:00:38.579> it<00:00:38.730> we

00:00:38.869 --> 00:00:38.879 
and so anyway let's take a look at it we

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:41.000 
and so anyway let's take a look at it we
actually<00:00:39.000> have<00:00:39.329> six<00:00:39.629> blocks<00:00:39.989> wide<00:00:40.260> by<00:00:40.710> six

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.010 
actually have six blocks wide by six

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:44.119 
actually have six blocks wide by six
blocks<00:00:41.309> tall<00:00:41.700> by<00:00:42.510> a<00:00:42.540> one<00:00:43.050> block<00:00:43.379> right<00:00:43.860> here

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:44.129 
blocks tall by a one block right here

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:47.119 
blocks tall by a one block right here
one<00:00:44.309> block<00:00:44.579> per<00:00:44.610> chest<00:00:45.260> which<00:00:46.260> is<00:00:46.289> very<00:00:46.739> small

00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:47.129 
one block per chest which is very small

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:49.279 
one block per chest which is very small
I<00:00:47.160> don't<00:00:47.370> know<00:00:47.550> if<00:00:47.640> it's<00:00:47.760> the<00:00:47.850> smallest<00:00:48.210> but<00:00:49.140> it

00:00:49.279 --> 00:00:49.289 
I don't know if it's the smallest but it

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:52.010 
I don't know if it's the smallest but it
is<00:00:49.440> very<00:00:50.070> small<00:00:50.340> and<00:00:50.760> anyway<00:00:51.449> let's<00:00:51.660> just<00:00:51.809> take

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:52.020 
is very small and anyway let's just take

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:54.229 
is very small and anyway let's just take
a<00:00:52.050> look<00:00:52.289> at<00:00:52.469> it<00:00:52.620> so<00:00:52.829> all<00:00:53.160> the<00:00:53.370> chests<00:00:53.760> are<00:00:53.910> empty

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239 
a look at it so all the chests are empty

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:58.400 
a look at it so all the chests are empty
right<00:00:54.420> now<00:00:54.449> okay<00:00:55.379> and<00:00:55.789> just<00:00:56.789> go<00:00:56.969> up<00:00:57.000> here<00:00:57.410> throw

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:58.410 
right now okay and just go up here throw

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:01.700 
right now okay and just go up here throw
your<00:00:58.559> items<00:00:58.890> in<00:00:59.039> the<00:00:59.219> top<00:00:59.430> water<00:00:59.699> scream<00:01:00.710> so

your items in the top water scream so

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:03.349 
your items in the top water scream so
we'll<00:01:01.829> just<00:01:01.949> throw<00:01:02.070> a<00:01:02.160> few<00:01:02.219> of<00:01:02.579> everything<00:01:03.120> in

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359 
we'll just throw a few of everything in

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:06.649 
we'll just throw a few of everything in
like<00:01:03.809> that<00:01:04.939> just<00:01:05.939> whatever<00:01:06.119> you<00:01:06.360> want<00:01:06.510> to<00:01:06.570> be

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659 
like that just whatever you want to be

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:09.520 
like that just whatever you want to be
sorted<00:01:07.200> and<00:01:07.409> that<00:01:07.830> should<00:01:08.130> go<00:01:08.280> through<00:01:08.310> and

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:09.530 
sorted and that should go through and

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:13.960 
sorted and that should go through and
there<00:01:10.530> we<00:01:10.619> go<00:01:10.740> we<00:01:11.580> have<00:01:11.610> it<00:01:11.820> all<00:01:12.030> sorted<00:01:12.630> and

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:13.970 
there we go we have it all sorted and

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:17.050 
there we go we have it all sorted and
those<00:01:14.970> other<00:01:15.600> stars<00:01:16.020> when<00:01:16.229> it's<00:01:16.320> somewhere

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:17.060 
those other stars when it's somewhere

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:21.100 
those other stars when it's somewhere
mmm<00:01:18.060> that's<00:01:18.330> strange

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:21.110 

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:24.200 

okay<00:01:22.110> yeah<00:01:22.290> so<00:01:22.590> there<00:01:23.130> is<00:01:23.340> a<00:01:23.369> very<00:01:23.909> slight

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210 
okay yeah so there is a very slight

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:26.330 
okay yeah so there is a very slight
problem<00:01:24.750> with<00:01:24.780> this<00:01:25.080> and<00:01:25.350> that's<00:01:26.070> just

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
problem with this and that's just

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:28.070 
problem with this and that's just
because<00:01:26.460> I<00:01:26.700> threw<00:01:26.939> them<00:01:27.060> in<00:01:27.180> here<00:01:27.299> manually<00:01:27.689> if

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080 
because I threw them in here manually if

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:30.289 
because I threw them in here manually if
the<00:01:28.619> items<00:01:28.950> aren't<00:01:29.130> thrown<00:01:29.460> in<00:01:29.610> like<00:01:29.790> sort<00:01:30.180> of

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
the items aren't thrown in like sort of

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:32.060 
the items aren't thrown in like sort of
in<00:01:30.390> the<00:01:30.479> middle<00:01:30.720> of<00:01:30.810> the<00:01:30.960> screen<00:01:31.140> they<00:01:31.470> do<00:01:31.860> have

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
in the middle of the screen they do have

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:34.190 
in the middle of the screen they do have
a<00:01:32.130> chance<00:01:32.430> to<00:01:32.610> kind<00:01:32.759> of<00:01:32.909> like<00:01:33.509> glitch<00:01:33.840> into

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200 
a chance to kind of like glitch into

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:36.080 
a chance to kind of like glitch into
this<00:01:34.320> block<00:01:34.650> and<00:01:34.920> then<00:01:35.369> they<00:01:35.490> sort<00:01:35.700> of<00:01:35.790> float

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
this block and then they sort of float

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:38.600 
this block and then they sort of float
along<00:01:36.299> the<00:01:36.659> rim<00:01:36.900> down<00:01:37.799> to<00:01:38.070> the<00:01:38.159> in<00:01:38.280> here<00:01:38.520> and

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610 
along the rim down to the in here and

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:40.219 
along the rim down to the in here and
they<00:01:38.670> don't<00:01:38.850> end<00:01:39.060> up<00:01:39.210> going<00:01:39.450> through<00:01:39.479> that's

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
they don't end up going through that's

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:41.899 
they don't end up going through that's
really<00:01:40.439> not<00:01:40.590> a<00:01:40.619> huge<00:01:40.829> problem<00:01:41.310> if<00:01:41.460> you<00:01:41.640> use<00:01:41.880> a

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:41.909 
really not a huge problem if you use a

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:43.490 
really not a huge problem if you use a
dispenser<00:01:42.570> or<00:01:42.600> something<00:01:43.020> like<00:01:43.140> that<00:01:43.350> to

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500 
dispenser or something like that to

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:45.620 
dispenser or something like that to
shoot<00:01:43.619> the<00:01:43.770> items<00:01:44.070> in<00:01:44.280> then<00:01:45.180> that<00:01:45.210> shouldn't

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
shoot the items in then that shouldn't

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:47.480 
shoot the items in then that shouldn't
happen<00:01:45.899> and<00:01:46.680> that's<00:01:46.799> actually<00:01:47.130> the<00:01:47.280> first

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:47.490 
happen and that's actually the first

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:48.679 
happen and that's actually the first
time<00:01:47.729> I've<00:01:47.820> seen<00:01:47.939> that<00:01:48.000> happened<00:01:48.420> right<00:01:48.540> here

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:48.689 
time I've seen that happened right here

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:50.780 
time I've seen that happened right here
so<00:01:49.079> anyway<00:01:50.040> that<00:01:50.220> shouldn't<00:01:50.460> be<00:01:50.549> a<00:01:50.579> huge

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:50.790 
so anyway that shouldn't be a huge

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:54.100 
so anyway that shouldn't be a huge
problem<00:01:51.060> pretty<00:01:51.390> easy<00:01:51.600> to<00:01:51.780> fix<00:01:52.020> right<00:01:52.380> there

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:54.110 
problem pretty easy to fix right there

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:56.569 
problem pretty easy to fix right there
now<00:01:55.110> as<00:01:55.439> you<00:01:55.590> can<00:01:55.710> see<00:01:55.770> everything<00:01:56.159> else<00:01:56.340> did

00:01:56.569 --> 00:01:56.579 
now as you can see everything else did

00:01:56.579 --> 00:01:59.929 
now as you can see everything else did
sort<00:01:56.880> properly<00:01:57.630> which<00:01:58.140> is<00:01:58.290> very<00:01:58.500> good<00:01:58.680> and<00:01:59.520> so

00:01:59.929 --> 00:01:59.939 
sort properly which is very good and so

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:01.700 
sort properly which is very good and so
yeah<00:02:00.119> let's<00:02:00.329> just<00:02:00.509> show<00:02:00.869> how<00:02:01.110> to<00:02:01.170> build<00:02:01.530> this

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:01.710 
yeah let's just show how to build this

and grab a few of the blocks I'm gonna

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:08.719 
and grab a few of the blocks I'm gonna
need<00:02:03.659> here<00:02:04.110> see<00:02:04.860> I'll<00:02:04.950> need<00:02:05.420> you<00:02:06.420> and<00:02:06.750> you<00:02:07.729> you

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:21.570 
lay out some chests here it's not the

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:24.260 
lay out some chests here it's not the
right<00:02:21.720> height<00:02:22.020> yeah<00:02:22.740> that<00:02:22.980> looks<00:02:23.100> right<00:02:23.280> so

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:24.270

right height yeah that looks right so
lay<00:02:24.450> out<00:02:24.570> some<00:02:24.720> chests<00:02:25.230> we're<00:02:26.010> gonna

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:26.130 
lay out some chests we're gonna

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:28.670 
lay out some chests we're gonna
alternate<00:02:26.640> regular<00:02:27.090> chests<00:02:27.510> and<00:02:27.690> trap<00:02:28.140> chests

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:28.680 
alternate regular chests and trap chests

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:32.510 
alternate regular chests and trap chests
so<00:02:28.920> that<00:02:29.040> we<00:02:29.100> can<00:02:29.220> get<00:02:29.340> them<00:02:29.430> side-by-side<00:02:31.520> and

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:32.520 
so that we can get them side-by-side and

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:34.520 
so that we can get them side-by-side and
you<00:02:32.580> know<00:02:33.360> let's<00:02:33.540> just<00:02:33.600> make<00:02:33.870> it<00:02:33.990> two<00:02:34.170> because

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:34.530 
you know let's just make it two because

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:35.570 
you know let's just make it two because
that's<00:02:34.680> all<00:02:34.770> we<00:02:34.890> really<00:02:34.920> need<00:02:35.190> to<00:02:35.220> show<00:02:35.430> this

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:35.580 
that's all we really need to show this

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:38.800 
that's all we really need to show this
off<00:02:35.790> I<00:02:36.380> know<00:02:37.380> it<00:02:37.500> did<00:02:37.590> not<00:02:37.710> grab<00:02:37.980> a<00:02:38.160> hopper

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:38.810 
off I know it did not grab a hopper

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:41.060 
off I know it did not grab a hopper
there<00:02:39.810> you<00:02:39.930> go<00:02:39.990> so<00:02:40.200> the<00:02:40.320> hoppers<00:02:40.620> right<00:02:40.800> here

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:41.070 
there you go so the hoppers right here

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:42.650 
there you go so the hoppers right here
are<00:02:41.250> gonna<00:02:41.310> be<00:02:41.430> pointing<00:02:41.790> into<00:02:42.090> the<00:02:42.150> chests

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:42.660 
are gonna be pointing into the chests

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:46.460 
are gonna be pointing into the chests
and<00:02:44.240> then<00:02:45.240> we'll<00:02:45.360> put<00:02:45.510> some<00:02:45.540> blocks<00:02:46.140> behind

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:46.470 
and then we'll put some blocks behind

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:50.540 
and then we'll put some blocks behind
those<00:02:48.350> comparators<00:02:49.350> we'll<00:02:49.590> go<00:02:49.740> here<00:02:50.070> now

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:50.550 
those comparators we'll go here now

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:52.450 
those comparators we'll go here now
here's<00:02:50.760> the<00:02:50.880> tricky<00:02:51.240> part<00:02:51.270> you<00:02:51.780> need<00:02:51.900> to<00:02:52.050> have

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:52.460 
here's the tricky part you need to have

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:56.240 
here's the tricky part you need to have
these<00:02:53.480> hoppers<00:02:54.480> pointed<00:02:55.110> away<00:02:55.320> from<00:02:55.650> the

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:56.250 
these hoppers pointed away from the

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:58.160 
these hoppers pointed away from the
hoppers<00:02:56.670> below<00:02:57.030> so<00:02:57.570> you<00:02:57.660> can't<00:02:57.870> have<00:02:57.990> them

00:02:58.160 --> 00:02:58.170 
hoppers below so you can't have them

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:01.700 
hoppers below so you can't have them
pointing<00:02:58.530> it<00:02:58.680> directly<00:02:59.360> excuse<00:03:00.360> me<00:03:00.710> directly

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:01.710 
pointing it directly excuse me directly

00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:04.100 
pointing it directly excuse me directly
at<00:03:01.890> the<00:03:02.160> hopper<00:03:02.490> below<00:03:02.730> if<00:03:02.940> you<00:03:03.060> do<00:03:03.180> that<00:03:03.420> it

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:04.110 
at the hopper below if you do that it

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:06.980 
at the hopper below if you do that it
won't<00:03:04.260> work<00:03:04.380> because<00:03:04.830> if<00:03:05.600> basically<00:03:06.600> the<00:03:06.720> idea

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:06.990 
won't work because if basically the idea

00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:08.510 
won't work because if basically the idea
here<00:03:07.230> is<00:03:07.260> that<00:03:07.380> this<00:03:07.710> hopper<00:03:08.100> isn't<00:03:08.340> going<00:03:08.460> to

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:08.520 
here is that this hopper isn't going to

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:09.950 
here is that this hopper isn't going to
be<00:03:08.610> powered<00:03:09.000> it's<00:03:09.270> going<00:03:09.420> to<00:03:09.480> prevent<00:03:09.720> the

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:09.960 
be powered it's going to prevent the

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:12.320 
be powered it's going to prevent the
hopper<00:03:10.230> above<00:03:10.500> from<00:03:10.830> putting<00:03:11.010> items<00:03:11.220> in<00:03:11.580> but

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:12.330 
hopper above from putting items in but

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:14.180 
hopper above from putting items in but
if<00:03:12.420> the<00:03:12.510> hopper<00:03:12.810> above<00:03:13.200> is<00:03:13.320> pointing<00:03:13.740> actually

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:14.190 
if the hopper above is pointing actually

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:15.770 
if the hopper above is pointing actually
at<00:03:14.340> the<00:03:14.520> hopper<00:03:14.820> it<00:03:15.000> will<00:03:15.150> put<00:03:15.330> items<00:03:15.630> in

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:15.780 
at the hopper it will put items in

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:17.630 
at the hopper it will put items in
regardless<00:03:16.260> of<00:03:16.440> the<00:03:16.650> state<00:03:17.100> of<00:03:17.130> this<00:03:17.340> hopper

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:17.640 
regardless of the state of this hopper

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:20.000 
regardless of the state of this hopper
and<00:03:17.790> that<00:03:18.690> will<00:03:18.810> mess<00:03:18.959> all<00:03:19.200> the<00:03:19.410> sorting<00:03:19.740> up<00:03:19.860> so

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:20.010 
and that will mess all the sorting up so

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:21.710 
and that will mess all the sorting up so
you<00:03:20.100> need<00:03:20.220> to<00:03:20.340> have<00:03:20.490> the<00:03:20.880> hoppers<00:03:21.330> above<00:03:21.570> a

00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:21.720 
you need to have the hoppers above a

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:23.540 
you need to have the hoppers above a
pointed<00:03:22.080> away<00:03:22.230> from<00:03:22.380> the<00:03:22.709> below<00:03:22.950> hoppers<00:03:23.280> just

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:23.550 
pointed away from the below hoppers just

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:25.370 
pointed away from the below hoppers just
whatever<00:03:23.760> direction<00:03:24.300> whatever<00:03:25.050> you<00:03:25.260> would

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:25.380 
whatever direction whatever you would

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:27.350 
whatever direction whatever you would
like<00:03:25.530> to<00:03:25.680> do<00:03:25.800> alright<00:03:26.610> so<00:03:26.790> then<00:03:26.940> we<00:03:27.090> need<00:03:27.209> to

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:27.360 
like to do alright so then we need to

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:29.150 
like to do alright so then we need to
focus<00:03:27.600> on<00:03:27.870> the<00:03:27.959> wiring<00:03:28.290> here<00:03:28.470> and<00:03:28.709> we<00:03:28.890> actually

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:29.160 
focus on the wiring here and we actually

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:30.800 
focus on the wiring here and we actually
have<00:03:29.280> to<00:03:29.340> do<00:03:29.430> some<00:03:29.610> pretty<00:03:29.700> crazy<00:03:29.910> wiring<00:03:30.570> so

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:30.810 
have to do some pretty crazy wiring so

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:32.330 
have to do some pretty crazy wiring so
that<00:03:30.959> we<00:03:31.050> have<00:03:31.260> these<00:03:31.440> staggered<00:03:31.980> from<00:03:32.160> each

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:32.340 
that we have these staggered from each

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:32.690 
that we have these staggered from each
other

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:32.700 
other

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:35.660 
other
so<00:03:33.270> I'm<00:03:33.420> gonna<00:03:33.510> do<00:03:33.720> here<00:03:34.140> is<00:03:34.459> see<00:03:35.459> we're<00:03:35.610> gonna

so I'm gonna do here is see we're gonna

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:36.650 
so I'm gonna do here is see we're gonna
go<00:03:35.850> out<00:03:36.090> like<00:03:36.330> this

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:36.660 
go out like this

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:38.690 
go out like this
and<00:03:36.959> put<00:03:37.560> redstone<00:03:37.709> on<00:03:37.980> top<00:03:38.190> you<00:03:38.370> need<00:03:38.459> to<00:03:38.580> have

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:38.700 
and put redstone on top you need to have

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:40.730 
and put redstone on top you need to have
the<00:03:38.970> two<00:03:39.150> lines<00:03:39.360> are<00:03:39.510> redstone<00:03:39.840> there<00:03:39.870> because

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:40.740 
the two lines are redstone there because

00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:42.530 
the two lines are redstone there because
we're<00:03:40.920> using<00:03:41.070> the<00:03:41.340> power<00:03:41.640> levels<00:03:42.120> of<00:03:42.330> the

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:42.540 
we're using the power levels of the

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:44.570 
we're using the power levels of the
comparator<00:03:43.050> then<00:03:43.230> we're<00:03:43.920> gonna<00:03:44.010> put<00:03:44.220> a<00:03:44.250> torch

00:03:44.570 --> 00:03:44.580 
comparator then we're gonna put a torch

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:47.030 
comparator then we're gonna put a torch
and<00:03:44.850> go<00:03:45.510> two<00:03:45.570> blocks<00:03:45.989> down<00:03:46.140> and<00:03:46.560> put<00:03:46.920> some

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:47.040 
and go two blocks down and put some

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:49.820 
and go two blocks down and put some
redstone<00:03:47.220> dust<00:03:47.580> on<00:03:47.880> that<00:03:48.180> and<00:03:48.540> then<00:03:49.470> two<00:03:49.650> more

00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:49.830 
redstone dust on that and then two more

00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:52.490 
redstone dust on that and then two more
blocks<00:03:50.220> and<00:03:50.840> you're<00:03:51.840> just<00:03:51.959> gonna<00:03:52.050> put<00:03:52.170> two

00:03:52.490 --> 00:03:52.500 
blocks and you're just gonna put two

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:55.670 
blocks and you're just gonna put two
repeaters<00:03:53.450> these<00:03:54.450> will<00:03:54.600> power<00:03:54.840> into<00:03:55.470> this

00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:55.680 
repeaters these will power into this

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:58.340 
repeaters these will power into this
block<00:03:56.010> here<00:03:56.550> and<00:03:56.670> that<00:03:57.540> block<00:03:57.750> is<00:03:57.930> touching

00:03:58.340 --> 00:03:58.350 
block here and that block is touching

00:03:58.350 --> 00:04:00.320 
block here and that block is touching
this<00:03:58.739> hopper<00:03:59.340> and<00:03:59.550> so<00:03:59.790> it<00:03:59.850> will<00:03:59.940> power<00:04:00.090> the

00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:00.330 
this hopper and so it will power the

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:05.120 
this hopper and so it will power the
hopper<00:04:01.790> okay<00:04:02.790> now<00:04:03.239> for<00:04:03.300> the<00:04:03.720> second<00:04:04.709> layer

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:05.130 
hopper okay now for the second layer

00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:08.000 
hopper okay now for the second layer
here<00:04:05.430> we're<00:04:06.330> going<00:04:06.480> to<00:04:06.540> do<00:04:06.720> block<00:04:07.530> like<00:04:07.709> that

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:08.010 
here we're going to do block like that

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:10.340 
here we're going to do block like that
and<00:04:08.310> actually<00:04:09.180> I<00:04:09.239> forgot<00:04:09.480> one<00:04:09.870> thing<00:04:09.900> here

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:10.350 
and actually I forgot one thing here

00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:12.800 
and actually I forgot one thing here
this<00:04:11.040> block<00:04:11.340> right<00:04:11.400> here<00:04:11.670> and<00:04:12.030> I'll<00:04:12.600> show<00:04:12.750> you

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:12.810 
this block right here and I'll show you

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:13.340 
this block right here and I'll show you
why

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:13.350 
why

00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:15.110 
why
okay<00:04:13.830> so<00:04:13.890> we're<00:04:14.070> gonna<00:04:14.190> be<00:04:14.340> putting<00:04:14.610> this

00:04:15.110 --> 00:04:15.120 
okay so we're gonna be putting this

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:17.659 
okay so we're gonna be putting this
hopper<00:04:15.450> is<00:04:15.540> gonna<00:04:15.690> be<00:04:16.010> excuse<00:04:17.010> me<00:04:17.190> the

00:04:17.659 --> 00:04:17.669 
hopper is gonna be excuse me the

00:04:17.669 --> 00:04:19.070 
hopper is gonna be excuse me the
comparators<00:04:18.270> going<00:04:18.510> to<00:04:18.570> be<00:04:18.660> powering<00:04:18.959> this

00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:19.080 
comparators going to be powering this

00:04:19.080 --> 00:04:20.420 
comparators going to be powering this
block<00:04:19.410> which<00:04:19.739> is<00:04:19.859> going<00:04:20.010> to<00:04:20.070> power<00:04:20.250> this

00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:20.430 
block which is going to power this

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:22.640 
block which is going to power this
redstone<00:04:20.660> now<00:04:21.660> this<00:04:21.810> redstone<00:04:22.109> right<00:04:22.289> here<00:04:22.470> as

00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:22.650 
redstone now this redstone right here as

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:25.460 
redstone now this redstone right here as
it<00:04:22.770> is<00:04:22.800> is<00:04:23.130> going<00:04:23.280> to<00:04:23.400> power<00:04:23.610> this<00:04:24.169> iron<00:04:25.169> block

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:25.470 
it is is going to power this iron block

00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:27.290 
it is is going to power this iron block
so<00:04:26.280> we<00:04:26.310> need<00:04:26.520> to<00:04:26.610> destroy<00:04:27.000> that

00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:27.300 
so we need to destroy that

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:29.510 
so we need to destroy that
and<00:04:27.509> put<00:04:27.990> a<00:04:28.020> half<00:04:28.379> slab<00:04:28.710> upside<00:04:29.220> down<00:04:29.370> half

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:29.520 
and put a half slab upside down half

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:32.180 
and put a half slab upside down half
slab<00:04:29.789> like<00:04:29.970> that<00:04:30.360> and<00:04:30.840> put<00:04:31.710> the<00:04:31.800> comparator

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:32.190 
slab like that and put the comparator

00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:33.619 
slab like that and put the comparator
right<00:04:32.310> on<00:04:32.460> there<00:04:32.580> the<00:04:32.759> comparator<00:04:33.240> will<00:04:33.419> still

00:04:33.619 --> 00:04:33.629 
right on there the comparator will still

00:04:33.629 --> 00:04:35.570 
right on there the comparator will still
function<00:04:33.780> exactly<00:04:34.440> the<00:04:34.560> same<00:04:34.770> but<00:04:35.220> now<00:04:35.370> this

00:04:35.570 --> 00:04:35.580 
function exactly the same but now this

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:37.520 
function exactly the same but now this
redstone<00:04:35.879> won't<00:04:36.180> power<00:04:36.389> that<00:04:36.659> block<00:04:37.020> which

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:37.530 
redstone won't power that block which

00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:39.230 
redstone won't power that block which
would<00:04:37.710> in<00:04:37.800> turn<00:04:37.949> power<00:04:38.220> the<00:04:38.400> hopper<00:04:38.699> so<00:04:38.879> you

00:04:39.230 --> 00:04:39.240 
would in turn power the hopper so you

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:40.730 
would in turn power the hopper so you
need<00:04:39.389> to<00:04:39.479> remember<00:04:39.629> to<00:04:39.810> do<00:04:40.020> that<00:04:40.199> use<00:04:40.500> a<00:04:40.530> half

00:04:40.730 --> 00:04:40.740 
need to remember to do that use a half

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:42.409 
need to remember to do that use a half
slab<00:04:40.979> or<00:04:41.310> glowstone<00:04:41.819> or<00:04:42.000> something<00:04:42.300> right

00:04:42.409 --> 00:04:42.419 
slab or glowstone or something right

00:04:42.419 --> 00:04:42.999 
slab or glowstone or something right
there

00:04:42.999 --> 00:04:43.009 
there

00:04:43.009 --> 00:04:44.960 
there
okay<00:04:44.009> now<00:04:44.129> we're<00:04:44.220> gonna<00:04:44.280> bring<00:04:44.520> this<00:04:44.729> wire

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:44.970 
okay now we're gonna bring this wire

00:04:44.970 --> 00:04:46.850 
okay now we're gonna bring this wire
down<00:04:45.389> and<00:04:45.750> again<00:04:46.050> we<00:04:46.199> need<00:04:46.259> to<00:04:46.349> have<00:04:46.500> the<00:04:46.650> two

00:04:46.850 --> 00:04:46.860 
down and again we need to have the two

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:50.420 
down and again we need to have the two
wire<00:04:47.099> links<00:04:47.520> so<00:04:48.180> that<00:04:48.330> we<00:04:48.389> can<00:04:48.539> use<00:04:48.690> the<00:04:49.430> power

00:04:50.420 --> 00:04:50.430 
wire links so that we can use the power

00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:52.700 
wire links so that we can use the power
level<00:04:50.819> of<00:04:50.940> the<00:04:51.060> comparator<00:04:51.599> then<00:04:52.110> under<00:04:52.500> here

00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:52.710 
level of the comparator then under here

00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:54.980 
level of the comparator then under here
we're<00:04:52.800> gonna<00:04:52.889> have<00:04:52.949> a<00:04:53.039> block<00:04:53.340> this<00:04:53.990> repeater

00:04:54.980 --> 00:04:54.990 
we're gonna have a block this repeater

00:04:54.990 --> 00:04:56.659 
we're gonna have a block this repeater
is<00:04:55.289> gonna<00:04:55.530> take<00:04:55.710> power<00:04:55.889> from<00:04:56.069> the<00:04:56.190> block<00:04:56.430> that

00:04:56.659 --> 00:04:56.669 
is gonna take power from the block that

00:04:56.669 --> 00:04:59.059 
is gonna take power from the block that
this<00:04:56.819> redstone<00:04:57.120> is<00:04:57.330> on<00:04:57.569> that<00:04:58.379> will<00:04:58.560> power<00:04:58.710> into

00:04:59.059 --> 00:04:59.069 
this redstone is on that will power into

00:04:59.069 --> 00:05:01.969 
this redstone is on that will power into
another<00:04:59.370> block<00:05:00.169> like<00:05:01.169> so<00:05:01.440> and<00:05:01.740> then<00:05:01.860> we'll

00:05:01.969 --> 00:05:01.979 
another block like so and then we'll

00:05:01.979 --> 00:05:03.950 
another block like so and then we'll
have<00:05:02.069> a<00:05:02.099> torch<00:05:02.430> on<00:05:02.699> that<00:05:03.060> block<00:05:03.360> it's<00:05:03.569> powering

00:05:03.950 --> 00:05:03.960 
have a torch on that block it's powering

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:06.740 
have a torch on that block it's powering
and<00:05:04.259> a<00:05:04.979> block<00:05:05.250> above<00:05:05.580> the<00:05:05.759> torch<00:05:06.000> the<00:05:06.479> torch

00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:06.750 
and a block above the torch the torch

00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:08.240 
and a block above the torch the torch
will<00:05:06.870> power<00:05:07.080> the<00:05:07.319> block<00:05:07.590> which<00:05:07.949> will<00:05:08.069> power

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:08.250 
will power the block which will power

00:05:08.250 --> 00:05:10.520 
will power the block which will power
the<00:05:08.580> hopper<00:05:08.940> so<00:05:09.090> now<00:05:09.870> if<00:05:09.990> I<00:05:10.050> just<00:05:10.199> throw<00:05:10.380> a<00:05:10.409> few

00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:10.530 
the hopper so now if I just throw a few

00:05:10.530 --> 00:05:12.320 
the hopper so now if I just throw a few
items<00:05:10.830> in<00:05:11.099> here<00:05:11.190> they<00:05:11.370> should<00:05:11.550> not<00:05:11.669> go<00:05:11.909> through

00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:12.330 
items in here they should not go through

00:05:12.330 --> 00:05:17.120 
items in here they should not go through
just<00:05:12.930> do<00:05:13.169> a<00:05:13.349> couple<00:05:14.039> of<00:05:14.099> comparators<00:05:14.669> and<00:05:16.130> didi

00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:17.130 
just do a couple of comparators and didi

00:05:17.130 --> 00:05:18.680 
just do a couple of comparators and didi
so<00:05:17.430> you<00:05:17.490> see<00:05:17.699> it<00:05:17.819> does<00:05:17.940> not<00:05:18.150> go<00:05:18.300> through<00:05:18.330> all

00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:18.690 
so you see it does not go through all

00:05:18.690 --> 00:05:20.510 
so you see it does not go through all

00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:23.250 
to set the sorting up so we can actually

00:05:23.250 --> 00:05:25.820 
to set the sorting up so we can actually
do<00:05:23.580> here<00:05:23.819> is<00:05:24.000> actually<00:05:24.569> me<00:05:24.870> grab<00:05:25.110> a<00:05:25.349> little<00:05:25.680> bit

00:05:25.830 --> 00:05:30.619 
do here is actually me grab a little bit
of<00:05:26.960> cobblestone<00:05:29.000> okay<00:05:30.000> so<00:05:30.090> for<00:05:30.300> the<00:05:30.360> items

00:05:30.619 --> 00:05:30.629 
of cobblestone okay so for the items

00:05:30.629 --> 00:05:31.640 
of cobblestone okay so for the items
you're<00:05:30.719> gonna<00:05:30.870> sort<00:05:31.139> let's<00:05:31.289> say<00:05:31.409> we're<00:05:31.560> gonna

00:05:34.770 --> 00:05:36.050 
sort TNT and gold so I'll put tin key in
here<00:05:34.949> now<00:05:35.159> you<00:05:35.250> actually<00:05:35.430> only<00:05:35.699> have<00:05:35.849> to<00:05:35.940> put

00:05:36.050 --> 00:05:36.060 
here now you actually only have to put

00:05:36.060 --> 00:05:38.839 
here now you actually only have to put
one<00:05:36.300> bit<00:05:36.750> of<00:05:36.870> TNT<00:05:37.259> in<00:05:37.409> and<00:05:37.620> you<00:05:38.400> can<00:05:38.550> fill<00:05:38.759> the

00:05:38.839 --> 00:05:38.849 
one bit of TNT in and you can fill the

00:05:38.849 --> 00:05:40.640 
one bit of TNT in and you can fill the
rest<00:05:39.000> up<00:05:39.180> with<00:05:39.240> cobble<00:05:39.870> or<00:05:40.050> another<00:05:40.349> block

00:05:40.640 --> 00:05:40.650 
rest up with cobble or another block

00:05:40.650 --> 00:05:42.110 
rest up with cobble or another block
that<00:05:40.949> you're<00:05:41.069> like<00:05:41.370> a<00:05:41.400> junk<00:05:41.699> block<00:05:41.940> that

00:05:42.110 --> 00:05:42.120 
that you're like a junk block that

00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:43.399 
that you're like a junk block that
you're<00:05:42.210> not<00:05:42.330> going<00:05:42.449> to<00:05:42.539> be<00:05:42.599> using<00:05:42.900> in<00:05:42.990> this<00:05:43.169> and

00:05:43.399 --> 00:05:43.409 
you're not going to be using in this and

00:05:43.409 --> 00:05:46.010 
you're not going to be using in this and
you<00:05:44.069> need<00:05:44.190> to<00:05:44.279> put<00:05:44.490> fill<00:05:45.419> it<00:05:45.539> up<00:05:45.630> and<00:05:45.779> then<00:05:45.840> have

00:05:46.010 --> 00:05:46.020 
you need to put fill it up and then have

00:05:46.020 --> 00:05:48.559 
you need to put fill it up and then have
18<00:05:46.500> so<00:05:46.770> this<00:05:46.889> will<00:05:47.039> have<00:05:47.159> a<00:05:47.190> total<00:05:47.520> of<00:05:47.610> 22<00:05:47.969> items

00:05:48.559 --> 00:05:48.569 
18 so this will have a total of 22 items

00:05:48.569 --> 00:05:50.779 
18 so this will have a total of 22 items
in<00:05:48.690> it<00:05:48.810> whenever<00:05:49.080> a<00:05:49.319> twenty<00:05:49.979> third<00:05:50.310> item<00:05:50.550> is

00:05:50.779 --> 00:05:50.789 
in it whenever a twenty third item is

00:05:50.789 --> 00:05:54.320 
in it whenever a twenty third item is
put<00:05:50.969> in<00:05:51.319> it'll<00:05:52.319> activate<00:05:52.620> the<00:05:53.490> comparator

00:05:54.320 --> 00:05:54.330 
put in it'll activate the comparator

00:05:54.330 --> 00:05:56.240 
put in it'll activate the comparator
till<00:05:54.479> the<00:05:54.539> power<00:05:54.719> level<00:05:55.050> to<00:05:55.229> that<00:05:55.949> will<00:05:56.069> power

00:05:56.240 --> 00:05:56.250 
till the power level to that will power

00:05:56.250 --> 00:05:58.040 
till the power level to that will power
down<00:05:56.400> to<00:05:56.520> this<00:05:56.759> redstone<00:05:57.060> which<00:05:57.719> will<00:05:57.900> power

00:05:58.040 --> 00:05:58.050 
down to this redstone which will power

00:05:58.050 --> 00:06:00.589 
down to this redstone which will power
into<00:05:58.590> the<00:05:58.830> repeater<00:05:59.240> deactivate<00:06:00.240> the<00:06:00.360> torch

00:06:00.589 --> 00:06:00.599 
into the repeater deactivate the torch

00:06:00.599 --> 00:06:02.779 
into the repeater deactivate the torch
and<00:06:00.810> allow<00:06:01.319> this<00:06:01.590> to<00:06:01.650> receive<00:06:02.069> an<00:06:02.190> item<00:06:02.490> and

00:06:02.779 --> 00:06:02.789 
and allow this to receive an item and

00:06:02.789 --> 00:06:04.610 
and allow this to receive an item and
put<00:06:03.000> it<00:06:03.090> in<00:06:03.180> the<00:06:03.240> chest<00:06:03.509> and<00:06:03.840> these<00:06:04.500> will

00:06:04.610 --> 00:06:04.620 
put it in the chest and these will

00:06:04.620 --> 00:06:06.080 
put it in the chest and these will
actually<00:06:04.860> need<00:06:04.979> to<00:06:05.099> one<00:06:05.279> item<00:06:05.580> in<00:06:05.699> them<00:06:05.849> -

00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:06.090 
actually need to one item in them -

00:06:06.090 --> 00:06:07.730 
actually need to one item in them -
that's<00:06:06.779> just<00:06:06.900> the<00:06:07.050> way<00:06:07.139> that<00:06:07.289> it'll<00:06:07.469> stay<00:06:07.680> so

00:06:07.730 --> 00:06:07.740 
that's just the way that it'll stay so

00:06:07.740 --> 00:06:10.279 
that's just the way that it'll stay so
now<00:06:08.099> if<00:06:08.250> I<00:06:08.310> put<00:06:08.340> more<00:06:09.330> in<00:06:09.449> will<00:06:09.599> see<00:06:09.750> it<00:06:09.840> work<00:06:10.020> it

00:06:10.279 --> 00:06:10.289 
now if I put more in will see it work it

00:06:10.289 --> 00:06:14.059 
now if I put more in will see it work it
activates<00:06:10.830> deactivates<00:06:11.669> and<00:06:12.440> our<00:06:13.440> TNT<00:06:13.860> is<00:06:13.949> in

00:06:14.059 --> 00:06:14.069 
activates deactivates and our TNT is in

00:06:14.069 --> 00:06:16.820 
activates deactivates and our TNT is in
there<00:06:14.279> and<00:06:14.490> it<00:06:15.300> always<00:06:15.449> takes<00:06:15.840> the<00:06:16.349> item<00:06:16.650> from

00:06:16.820 --> 00:06:16.830 
there and it always takes the item from

00:06:16.830 --> 00:06:18.740 
there and it always takes the item from
the<00:06:17.039> leftmost<00:06:17.699> slot<00:06:18.180> so<00:06:18.449> you<00:06:18.509> can<00:06:18.659> have

00:06:18.740 --> 00:06:18.750 
the leftmost slot so you can have

00:06:18.750 --> 00:06:20.809 
the leftmost slot so you can have
whatever<00:06:19.139> items<00:06:19.469> in<00:06:19.710> here<00:06:20.039> to<00:06:20.279> fill<00:06:20.490> that<00:06:20.639> up

00:06:20.809 --> 00:06:20.819 
whatever items in here to fill that up

00:06:20.819 --> 00:06:22.010 
whatever items in here to fill that up
just<00:06:21.150> so<00:06:21.240> we<00:06:21.330> don't<00:06:21.360> have<00:06:21.539> to<00:06:21.630> fill<00:06:21.750> the<00:06:21.870> whole

00:06:22.010 --> 00:06:22.020 
just so we don't have to fill the whole

00:06:22.020 --> 00:06:23.540 
just so we don't have to fill the whole
thing<00:06:22.050> up<00:06:22.259> with<00:06:22.860> whatever<00:06:23.039> item<00:06:23.430> we're

00:06:23.540 --> 00:06:23.550 
thing up with whatever item we're

00:06:23.550 --> 00:06:25.600 
thing up with whatever item we're
sorting<00:06:23.880> so<00:06:24.509> we'll<00:06:24.630> do<00:06:24.719> the<00:06:24.810> same<00:06:24.960> thing<00:06:25.199> here

00:06:25.600 --> 00:06:25.610 
sorting so we'll do the same thing here

00:06:25.610 --> 00:06:30.499 
sorting so we'll do the same thing here
do<00:06:26.610> that<00:06:26.819> and<00:06:27.060> then<00:06:27.210> put<00:06:27.389> in<00:06:27.569> 18<00:06:28.319> and<00:06:29.330> put<00:06:30.330> a

00:06:30.499 --> 00:06:30.509 
do that and then put in 18 and put a

00:06:30.509 --> 00:06:32.600 
do that and then put in 18 and put a
piece<00:06:30.810> of<00:06:30.840> gold<00:06:31.080> in<00:06:31.259> and<00:06:31.469> then<00:06:32.219> of<00:06:32.310> course<00:06:32.490> we

00:06:32.600 --> 00:06:32.610 
piece of gold in and then of course we

00:06:32.610 --> 00:06:35.059 
piece of gold in and then of course we
drop<00:06:32.819> a<00:06:33.000> few<00:06:33.150> more<00:06:33.300> pieces<00:06:33.449> of<00:06:33.599> gold<00:06:33.949> it<00:06:34.949> will

00:06:35.059 --> 00:06:35.069 
drop a few more pieces of gold it will

00:06:35.069 --> 00:06:38.510 
drop a few more pieces of gold it will
activate<00:06:35.430> and<00:06:35.839> it'll<00:06:36.839> sort<00:06:37.050> it<00:06:37.250> and<00:06:38.250> then<00:06:38.339> the

00:06:38.510 --> 00:06:38.520 
activate and it'll sort it and then the

00:06:38.520 --> 00:06:41.270 
activate and it'll sort it and then the
water<00:06:38.550> stream<00:06:39.000> is<00:06:40.009> pretty<00:06:41.009> straight

00:06:41.270 --> 00:06:41.280 
water stream is pretty straight

00:06:41.280 --> 00:06:44.500 
water stream is pretty straight
forward<00:06:41.550> we<00:06:41.790> just<00:06:41.820> need<00:06:42.120> to<00:06:42.210> have<00:06:42.360> a<00:06:42.770> little

00:06:44.500 --> 00:06:44.510 
forward we just need to have a little

00:06:44.510 --> 00:06:58.520 
forward we just need to have a little
barrier<00:06:45.510> around<00:06:45.960> it<00:06:46.190> get<00:06:49.880> like<00:06:50.880> so<00:06:55.460> and<00:06:57.530> then

00:06:58.520 --> 00:06:58.530 
barrier around it get like so and then

00:06:58.530 --> 00:07:01.300 
barrier around it get like so and then
of<00:06:58.560> course<00:06:58.680> just<00:06:58.889> put<00:06:59.250> a<00:06:59.370> bucket<00:06:59.669> of<00:06:59.760> water<00:07:00.030> on

00:07:01.300 --> 00:07:01.310 
of course just put a bucket of water on

00:07:01.310 --> 00:07:04.730 
of course just put a bucket of water on
one<00:07:02.310> of<00:07:02.370> these<00:07:02.490> now<00:07:02.850> this<00:07:03.060> bit<00:07:03.240> here<00:07:03.740> this

00:07:04.730 --> 00:07:04.740 
one of these now this bit here this

00:07:04.740 --> 00:07:07.970 
one of these now this bit here this
these<00:07:05.310> two<00:07:05.580> chests<00:07:06.120> here<00:07:06.360> are<00:07:06.570> tileable<00:07:07.169> so

00:07:07.970 --> 00:07:07.980 
these two chests here are tileable so

00:07:07.980 --> 00:07:09.980 
these two chests here are tileable so
you<00:07:08.040> can<00:07:08.220> just<00:07:08.370> take<00:07:08.550> this<00:07:08.820> and<00:07:09.060> keep<00:07:09.840> building

00:07:09.980 --> 00:07:09.990 
you can just take this and keep building

00:07:09.990 --> 00:07:11.390 
you can just take this and keep building
it<00:07:10.230> over<00:07:10.530> and<00:07:10.650> over<00:07:10.740> again<00:07:10.919> and<00:07:11.160> that's<00:07:11.250> what

00:07:11.390 --> 00:07:11.400 
it over and over again and that's what

00:07:11.400 --> 00:07:14.060 
it over and over again and that's what
I've<00:07:11.520> done<00:07:11.550> over<00:07:11.700> here<00:07:11.910> as<00:07:12.180> you<00:07:12.270> can<00:07:12.419> see<00:07:13.070> with

00:07:14.060 --> 00:07:14.070 
I've done over here as you can see with

00:07:14.070 --> 00:07:16.940 
I've done over here as you can see with
the<00:07:14.250> wiring<00:07:14.460> and<00:07:14.700> all<00:07:14.820> that<00:07:15.000> and<00:07:15.650> that's<00:07:16.650> the

00:07:16.940 --> 00:07:16.950 
the wiring and all that and that's the

00:07:16.950 --> 00:07:18.350 
the wiring and all that and that's the
way<00:07:17.040> you<00:07:17.100> stagger<00:07:17.400> the<00:07:17.669> wiring<00:07:17.970> so<00:07:18.150> that<00:07:18.270> they

00:07:18.350 --> 00:07:18.360 
way you stagger the wiring so that they

00:07:18.360 --> 00:07:20.150 
way you stagger the wiring so that they
don't<00:07:18.570> interfere<00:07:18.810> with<00:07:19.050> each<00:07:19.230> other<00:07:19.410> but<00:07:20.010> yeah

00:07:20.150 --> 00:07:20.160 
don't interfere with each other but yeah

00:07:20.160 --> 00:07:22.130 
don't interfere with each other but yeah
this<00:07:20.280> bit<00:07:20.490> here<00:07:20.790> is<00:07:20.970> tileable<00:07:21.720> so<00:07:21.960> you<00:07:22.020> can

00:07:22.130 --> 00:07:22.140 
this bit here is tileable so you can

00:07:22.140 --> 00:07:23.600 
this bit here is tileable so you can
stack<00:07:22.350> this<00:07:22.500> as<00:07:22.650> many<00:07:22.890> times<00:07:23.130> as<00:07:23.340> you<00:07:23.520> would

00:07:23.600 --> 00:07:23.610 
stack this as many times as you would

00:07:23.610 --> 00:07:26.780 
stack this as many times as you would
like<00:07:23.760> to<00:07:24.030> and<00:07:24.770> yeah<00:07:25.770> as<00:07:25.950> for<00:07:26.160> the<00:07:26.250> water<00:07:26.400> stream

00:07:26.780 --> 00:07:26.790 
like to and yeah as for the water stream

00:07:26.790 --> 00:07:29.060 
like to and yeah as for the water stream
there<00:07:27.000> if<00:07:27.780> you<00:07:27.990> I<00:07:28.169> notice<00:07:28.650> that<00:07:28.710> if<00:07:28.830> you<00:07:28.919> use

00:07:29.060 --> 00:07:29.070 
there if you I notice that if you use

00:07:29.070 --> 00:07:31.460 
there if you I notice that if you use
glass<00:07:29.430> blocks<00:07:29.820> or<00:07:30.120> another<00:07:30.390> non<00:07:30.750> solid<00:07:31.230> block

00:07:31.460 --> 00:07:31.470 
glass blocks or another non solid block

00:07:31.470 --> 00:07:33.440 
glass blocks or another non solid block
to<00:07:31.800> surround<00:07:32.100> the<00:07:32.190> water<00:07:32.400> stream<00:07:32.729> then<00:07:33.270> it's

00:07:33.440 --> 00:07:33.450 
to surround the water stream then it's

00:07:33.450 --> 00:07:35.150 
to surround the water stream then it's
much<00:07:33.630> more<00:07:33.840> likely<00:07:34.080> for<00:07:34.410> the<00:07:34.470> items<00:07:34.740> to<00:07:34.919> glitch

00:07:35.150 --> 00:07:35.160 
much more likely for the items to glitch

00:07:35.160 --> 00:07:36.560 
much more likely for the items to glitch
into<00:07:35.430> the<00:07:35.550> block<00:07:35.790> as<00:07:35.970> I<00:07:36.090> was<00:07:36.210> talking<00:07:36.510> about

00:07:36.560 --> 00:07:36.570 
into the block as I was talking about

00:07:36.570 --> 00:07:39.080 
into the block as I was talking about
and<00:07:36.870> gets<00:07:37.080> stuck<00:07:37.320> on<00:07:37.530> the<00:07:37.710> rim<00:07:37.890> of<00:07:37.919> the<00:07:38.250> of<00:07:38.700> the

00:07:39.080 --> 00:07:39.090 
and gets stuck on the rim of the of the

00:07:39.090 --> 00:07:41.180 
and gets stuck on the rim of the of the
hopper<00:07:39.510> and<00:07:39.780> so<00:07:40.410> one<00:07:40.560> thing<00:07:40.590> you<00:07:40.770> can<00:07:40.919> do<00:07:41.040> is

00:07:41.180 --> 00:07:41.190 
hopper and so one thing you can do is

00:07:41.190 --> 00:07:43.490 
hopper and so one thing you can do is
just<00:07:41.430> use<00:07:41.700> like<00:07:42.360> I<00:07:42.479> said<00:07:42.690> a<00:07:42.720> dispenser<00:07:43.260> or<00:07:43.290> a

00:07:43.490 --> 00:07:43.500 
just use like I said a dispenser or a

00:07:43.500 --> 00:07:44.990 
just use like I said a dispenser or a
dropper<00:07:43.919> or<00:07:43.950> something<00:07:44.310> to<00:07:44.430> shoot<00:07:44.610> the<00:07:44.729> items

00:07:44.990 --> 00:07:45.000 
dropper or something to shoot the items

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:46.969 
dropper or something to shoot the items
in<00:07:45.150> and<00:07:45.360> that<00:07:45.840> should<00:07:46.020> get<00:07:46.169> them<00:07:46.350> basically<00:07:46.860> in

00:07:46.969 --> 00:07:46.979 
in and that should get them basically in

00:07:46.979 --> 00:07:48.950 
in and that should get them basically in
the<00:07:47.070> middle<00:07:47.100> of<00:07:47.460> the<00:07:47.580> stream<00:07:47.910> and<00:07:48.120> that<00:07:48.690> should

00:07:48.950 --> 00:07:48.960 
the middle of the stream and that should

00:07:48.960 --> 00:07:50.270 
the middle of the stream and that should
not<00:07:49.080> be<00:07:49.229> a<00:07:49.260> problem<00:07:49.680> that<00:07:49.710> was<00:07:49.890> actually<00:07:50.190> the

00:07:50.270 --> 00:07:50.280 
not be a problem that was actually the

00:07:50.280 --> 00:07:53.120 
not be a problem that was actually the
first<00:07:50.460> time<00:07:50.760> in<00:07:51.690> the<00:07:51.840> recent<00:07:52.290> updates<00:07:52.950> that

00:07:53.120 --> 00:07:53.130 
first time in the recent updates that

00:07:53.130 --> 00:07:55.370 
first time in the recent updates that
I've<00:07:53.250> noticed<00:07:53.669> that<00:07:53.940> happening<00:07:54.270> but<00:07:55.229> yeah

00:07:55.370 --> 00:07:55.380 
I've noticed that happening but yeah

00:07:55.380 --> 00:07:56.990 
I've noticed that happening but yeah
anyway<00:07:55.650> I<00:07:55.680> think<00:07:55.770> that<00:07:56.100> is<00:07:56.310> going<00:07:56.550> to<00:07:56.640> be<00:07:56.700> about

00:07:56.990 --> 00:07:57.000 
anyway I think that is going to be about

00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:58.460 
anyway I think that is going to be about
it<00:07:57.300> hopefully<00:07:57.510> I<00:07:57.720> didn't<00:07:58.020> bore<00:07:58.169> you<00:07:58.200> too<00:07:58.440> much
