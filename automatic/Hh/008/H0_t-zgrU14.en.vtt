00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:16.250 
know it's hard because over what we're

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:18.190 
know it's hard because over what we're
looking<00:00:16.490> for<00:00:16.520> with<00:00:16.790> one<00:00:16.970> of<00:00:17.090> these<00:00:17.240> full<00:00:17.869> front

make them jump out of the page at you

00:00:41.199 --> 00:00:43.780 
make them jump out of the page at you
but<00:00:42.199> mostly<00:00:42.589> it<00:00:42.739> comes<00:00:42.979> down<00:00:43.159> to<00:00:43.339> having<00:00:43.460> each

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:43.790 
but mostly it comes down to having each

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:45.670 
but mostly it comes down to having each
subject<00:00:44.150> and<00:00:44.540> workers<00:00:44.900> and<00:00:45.170> that's<00:00:45.470> what
