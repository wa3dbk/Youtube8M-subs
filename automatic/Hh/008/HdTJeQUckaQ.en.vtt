00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:10.380
 Hello everyone, what are you waiting for? 

00:00:09.180 --> 00:00:12.240
 that is very well today I love you 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:14.760
 share my first makeup video 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:17.010
 Christmas and is to learn these colors 

00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:18.869
 I wanted to eat the green gold colors and 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:20.310
 wine color because apart from the red of the 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:22.980
 zone you are very like an expert 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:24.840
 season and I'm fascinated especially 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:26.790
 was inspired because it was the ball of 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:28.140
 Christmas that I had them also have 

00:00:26.790 --> 00:00:30.119
 my previous life I do not know if they have seen it 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:31.860
 but to deposit I have it in the 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:35.340
 video information tape and it was of 

00:00:31.860 --> 00:00:37.440
 the ornaments are like gold and greenish cakes 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:39.480
 and it also came as a little more no no 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:41.730
 I know I loved this combination and so 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:44.339
 nothing I hope you like the world almost 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:47.129
 a little bit although we have lost in the 

00:00:44.339 --> 00:00:48.719
 others it's like subtly smoothly 

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:50.699
 because maybe with the lips like that 

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:52.920
 a little more striking a little bit more 

00:00:50.699 --> 00:00:54.870
 beads and wine color and then nothing I hope 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:57.260
 they like and what they have left to see 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:57.260
 we passed 

00:00:57.370 --> 00:01:02.450
 a look with a touch of super color 

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:04.760
 fast simple but classic of the 

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:06.470
 Christmas first let's start 

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:08.300
 applying a pre-base throughout the 

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:10.130
 eyelid to the bone of the eyebrows for 

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:12.530
 match the area and that the shadows 

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:14.240
 last a little more often we are going to 

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:16.280
 be applying a shadow in cream 

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:18.950
 color or on the entire mobile eyelid but 

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:20.720
 without passing the basin I will be 

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:22.940
 applying with a brush but you 

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:24.440
 they can also do it with their fingers and 

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:26.860
 this will make the shadows a 

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:29.830
 little bit more shine so more vibrant 

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:32.510
 also in the lower part of the shoulder 

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:34.790
 now I'm going to take a shadow over 

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:38.060
 cream color and I'll be applying 

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:39.740
 in the bone of the eyebrow to the basin and 

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:42.020
 I'm doing this because I want to 

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:45.259
 concentrate all attention on the eyelid 

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:47.030
 mobile around our eyes now 

00:01:45.259 --> 00:01:49.250
 we are going to be taking a shadow 

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:51.229
 vanilla fairy shining and we're going to 

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:52.610
 be applying just above the 

00:01:51.229 --> 00:01:55.580
 shadow in cream that we have applied 

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:59.360
 previously we will be applying 

00:01:55.580 --> 00:02:01.970
 tap and drag gently 

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:04.730
 they watched as the shadows startled 

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:06.940
 little bit more the same thing we will be 

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:09.890
 doing in the lower part of the eye 

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:11.750
 now we are going to be taking a tone 

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:14.330
 medium green and we will be 

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:16.400
 applying just in the basin and the 

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:17.690
 we will be blurring with the shadow 

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:20.750
 vanilla color that we apply 

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:23.900
 before and we're going to blur it 

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:26.150
 until I almost do not see this I do 

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:29.840
 to give a touch of green but 

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:32.430
 without being so strong we soften enough 

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:35.069
 those shadows in the crease 

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:37.140
 now with a cream eyeliner color 

00:02:35.069 --> 00:02:39.719
 black we're going to be delineating the part 

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:41.909
 top of the eyes and for this I'm going to 

00:02:39.719 --> 00:02:44.459
 be doing a little tail towards 

00:02:41.909 --> 00:02:46.799
 the outside and I will bring the eyeliner 

00:02:44.459 --> 00:02:48.750
 up to half of the voters going on 

00:02:46.799 --> 00:02:51.829
 a little bit of the half but without getting 

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:51.829
 completely to the lacrimal 

00:02:55.069 --> 00:02:59.480
 we do the same outlined in the part 

00:02:57.799 --> 00:03:01.830
 under the eyes without taking it to the 

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:03.960
 completely tear 

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:06.190
 this will notice the effect of an eye a 

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:08.710
 little bit more open 

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:10.840
 now we take a satiny shadow on 

00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:13.540
 color came and we will be applying 

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:16.950
 from the lacrimal joining the xiv with the 

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:16.950
 outlined that we did previously 

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:23.580
 and this will give us like that extra of 

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:23.580
 color to makeup 

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:29.400
 now we are going to be taking the same 

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:31.800
 shadow instead of that we have applied in 

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:34.200
 the fold and we will be applying 

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:36.330
 in the lower part of the eye from the 

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:38.940
 tearing them together and with the delineation 

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:40.620
 that we did earlier and this will give you 

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:43.170
 to the makeup I summoned this touch 

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:44.880
 funny color we line the line 

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:47.820
 of water in black to do it a little 

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:49.860
 more striking the same shadow vanilla 

00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:53.280
 Shiny in the lacrimal to give more 

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:55.440
 induced in the makeup to finish 

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:58.310
 the eyes the mask how many layers do you want 

00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:58.310
 up and down 

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:04.450
 ok now we go for the contour and so 

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:07.840
 we outline the face and also like 

00:04:04.450 --> 00:04:10.150
 we give ourselves a little more color 

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:11.980
 now we are going to be applying the blush 

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:14.290
 in coral pink and we will be 

00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:16.389
 applying like this with a double fiber brush 

00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:18.820
 in order to control a little more the 

00:04:16.389 --> 00:04:20.560
 quantity and we will be applying 

00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:24.370
 from the middle of the cheek towards 

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:26.290
 outside so as not to overload them so much 

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:27.820
 and as you know I like the 

00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:30.310
 luminosity we will be applying 

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:32.860
 illuminator at the highest point of the 

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:36.010
 cheeks on the forehead on the chin and on 

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:37.840
 the bridge of the nose and to finish the 

00:04:36.010 --> 00:04:39.910
 makeup we are going to be applying a 

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:42.490
 matte lipstick intense red wine for a 

00:04:39.910 --> 00:04:44.800
 more party look 

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:46.810
 I do not know if they had noticed but to me 

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:50.759
 like honey on the lips first with 

00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:50.759
 the same lip and then the fillings 

00:04:51.420 --> 00:04:57.530
 and to finish the 2 completely the 

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:57.530
 Christmas hat and lists 

00:04:58.020 --> 00:05:01.289
 when girls weave the finished ones but 

00:04:59.910 --> 00:05:02.759
 that you liked it, I hope you have 

00:05:01.289 --> 00:05:04.440
 enjoyed and I also hope that there 

00:05:02.759 --> 00:05:07.080
 I was left with some idea I do not know for some 

00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:08.789
 party they're going to go or something like that and then 

00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:10.590
 nothing to me I really love that 

00:05:08.789 --> 00:05:12.360
 I love this look especially the 

00:05:10.590 --> 00:05:14.250
 lips I'm in love with this color 

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:16.289
 flashy hobby because I do not know me 

00:05:14.250 --> 00:05:18.300
 I love it and well I hope it is also 

00:05:16.289 --> 00:05:20.370
 Have a nice Christmas party

 grateful for everything exactly 

00:05:52.370 --> 00:05:55.540

 Y
