to the case this is an incipio feather
case<00:02:49.590> very<00:02:50.489> slim<00:02:50.790> that<00:02:50.970> doesn't<00:02:51.390> really<00:02:51.930> cover

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:52.290 
case very slim that doesn't really cover

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:55.520 
case very slim that doesn't really cover
the<00:02:52.620> whole<00:02:52.860> device<00:02:53.900> it's<00:02:54.900> only<00:02:55.019> meant<00:02:55.290> like<00:02:55.440> I

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:55.530 
the whole device it's only meant like I

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:59.020 
the whole device it's only meant like I
said<00:02:55.739> for<00:02:55.950> aesthetics<00:02:56.370> and<00:02:56.549> small<00:02:57.390> accidents

00:02:59.020 --> 00:02:59.030 
said for aesthetics and small accidents

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:02.030 
said for aesthetics and small accidents
here<00:03:00.030> you<00:03:00.150> have<00:03:00.299> the<00:03:00.569> cutout<00:03:00.989> for<00:03:01.680> the<00:03:01.739> power

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:02.040 
here you have the cutout for the power

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:04.880 
here you have the cutout for the power
button<00:03:02.959> this<00:03:03.959> isn't<00:03:04.200> seem<00:03:04.379> to<00:03:04.500> be<00:03:04.590> a<00:03:04.620> power

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:04.890 
button this isn't seem to be a power

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:07.039 
button this isn't seem to be a power
button<00:03:05.040> for<00:03:05.160> the<00:03:05.310> 3-pin<00:03:05.790> dock<00:03:06.090> connector<00:03:06.660> but

00:03:07.039 --> 00:03:07.049 
button for the 3-pin dock connector but

00:03:07.049 --> 00:03:09.530 
button for the 3-pin dock connector but
so<00:03:07.410> far<00:03:07.650> nothing<00:03:08.340> really<00:03:08.670> takes<00:03:08.880> advantage<00:03:09.450> of

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:09.540 
so far nothing really takes advantage of

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:14.780 
so far nothing really takes advantage of
it<00:03:09.690> so<00:03:09.959> it<00:03:10.260> might<00:03:10.500> not<00:03:11.310> even<00:03:11.370> matter<00:03:13.579> here<00:03:14.579> you

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:14.790 
it so it might not even matter here you

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:18.110 
it so it might not even matter here you
have<00:03:14.910> access<00:03:15.359> to<00:03:15.389> the<00:03:15.569> volume<00:03:15.829> control<00:03:17.120> that

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:18.120 
have access to the volume control that

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:20.569 
have access to the volume control that
is<00:03:18.480> where<00:03:19.230> the<00:03:19.380> speaker<00:03:19.680> would<00:03:19.769> be<00:03:19.980> some<00:03:20.340> sip

00:03:20.569 --> 00:03:20.579 
is where the speaker would be some sip

00:03:20.579 --> 00:03:23.710 
is where the speaker would be some sip

00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:40.710 
galaxy nexus okay
also<00:03:39.190> seems<00:03:39.370> to<00:03:39.460> have<00:03:39.580> some<00:03:39.850> soft<00:03:40.150> backing<00:03:40.600> on

also seems to have some soft backing on
the<00:03:40.810> back<00:03:41.020> so<00:03:41.950> it<00:03:41.980> doesn't<00:03:42.310> scratch<00:03:42.400> up<00:03:42.730> your

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:42.760

phone which is always good so it's

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:47.160 
phone which is always good so it's
pretty<00:03:45.340> simple<00:03:45.520> to<00:03:45.670> get<00:03:45.790> the<00:03:45.910> case<00:03:46.120> on<00:03:46.390> the

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:47.170 
pretty simple to get the case on the

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:49.800 
pretty simple to get the case on the
very<00:03:47.320> slim<00:03:47.560> device<00:03:47.890> it<00:03:48.760> feels<00:03:49.180> really<00:03:49.510> good<00:03:49.750> in

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:49.810 
very slim device it feels really good in

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:53.190 
very slim device it feels really good in
the<00:03:50.020> hand<00:03:50.260> with<00:03:50.770> the<00:03:50.920> case<00:03:51.720> it<00:03:52.720> doesn't<00:03:53.020> cover

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:53.200 
the hand with the case it doesn't cover

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:58.850 
the hand with the case it doesn't cover
the<00:03:53.290> top<00:03:53.910> or<00:03:54.910> the<00:03:55.150> bottom<00:03:55.590> ok<00:03:56.760> it's<00:03:57.760> a

00:03:58.850 --> 00:03:58.860 
the top or the bottom ok it's a

00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:02.270 
the top or the bottom ok it's a
basically<00:03:59.860> met<00:04:00.280> if<00:04:00.490> you<00:04:00.640> drop<00:04:00.850> it<00:04:01.000> on<00:04:01.090> its<00:04:01.240> back

00:04:02.270 --> 00:04:02.280 
basically met if you drop it on its back

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:06.630 
basically met if you drop it on its back
drop<00:04:03.280> on<00:04:03.460> its<00:04:03.670> corners<00:04:04.150> sides<00:04:05.280> you<00:04:06.280> know<00:04:06.400> would

00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:06.640 
drop on its corners sides you know would

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:10.440 
drop on its corners sides you know would
be<00:04:06.760> fine<00:04:07.030> but<00:04:07.270> if<00:04:08.020> you<00:04:08.140> drop<00:04:08.410> it<00:04:08.670> say<00:04:09.670> that<00:04:09.940> down

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:10.450 
be fine but if you drop it say that down

00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:13.020 
be fine but if you drop it say that down
this<00:04:10.720> way<00:04:10.780> or<00:04:11.260> this<00:04:11.680> way<00:04:11.790> probably<00:04:12.790> get<00:04:13.000> a

00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:13.030 
this way or this way probably get a

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:15.660 
this way or this way probably get a
little<00:04:13.390> messed<00:04:13.570> up<00:04:13.780> and<00:04:14.250> it<00:04:15.250> doesn't<00:04:15.400> have<00:04:15.610> the

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:15.670 
little messed up and it doesn't have the

00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:18.870 
little messed up and it doesn't have the
lip<00:04:16.000> in<00:04:16.180> the<00:04:16.270> front<00:04:17.040> see<00:04:18.040> doesn't<00:04:18.310> have<00:04:18.550> a<00:04:18.580> lip

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:18.880 
lip in the front see doesn't have a lip

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:21.510 
lip in the front see doesn't have a lip
so<00:04:19.570> you<00:04:19.630> put<00:04:20.050> a<00:04:20.080> face<00:04:20.320> down<00:04:20.590> there's<00:04:21.400> a

00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:21.520 
so you put a face down there's a

00:04:21.520 --> 00:04:23.490 
so you put a face down there's a
possibility<00:04:21.970> of<00:04:22.450> the<00:04:22.660> getting<00:04:22.930> scratch<00:04:23.230> and

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:23.500 
possibility of the getting scratch and

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:26.160 
possibility of the getting scratch and
it<00:04:23.620> drops<00:04:23.830> that<00:04:24.040> way<00:04:24.360> most<00:04:25.360> likely<00:04:25.600> the<00:04:25.840> screen

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:26.170 
it drops that way most likely the screen

00:04:26.170 --> 00:04:32.550 
it drops that way most likely the screen
could<00:04:26.500> crack<00:04:27.090> or<00:04:28.090> scratch<00:04:29.580> okay<00:04:30.750> so<00:04:31.750> like<00:04:32.470> I

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:32.560 
could crack or scratch okay so like I

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:34.670 
could crack or scratch okay so like I
said<00:04:32.620> it<00:04:32.890> feels<00:04:33.040> really<00:04:33.250> good<00:04:33.370> in<00:04:33.520> the<00:04:33.670> hand

00:04:34.670 --> 00:04:34.680 
said it feels really good in the hand

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:38.910 
said it feels really good in the hand
you<00:04:35.680> say<00:04:35.980> it's<00:04:36.340> tampered<00:04:37.090> right<00:04:37.450> here<00:04:37.780> so<00:04:38.410> when
