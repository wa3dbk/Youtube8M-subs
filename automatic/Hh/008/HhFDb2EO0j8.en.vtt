00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 
it up so that you're not triggering

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:00.800

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:09.360 
some of the ebay triggers getting a

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:11.630 
some of the ebay triggers getting a
solid<00:02:09.569> fit<00:02:10.020> when<00:02:10.770> I<00:02:10.800> put<00:02:10.979> it<00:02:11.039> in<00:02:11.069> and<00:02:11.250> lock<00:02:11.430> it

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:11.640 
solid fit when I put it in and lock it

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:13.580 
solid fit when I put it in and lock it
there's<00:02:12.420> not<00:02:12.569> a<00:02:12.630> lot<00:02:12.780> of<00:02:12.810> movement<00:02:13.200> there<00:02:13.380> it's

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:13.590 
there's not a lot of movement there it's

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:14.960 
there's not a lot of movement there it's
a<00:02:13.650> lot<00:02:13.800> tighter<00:02:14.010> than<00:02:14.280> most<00:02:14.520> of<00:02:14.730> them<00:02:14.819> have

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:14.970 
a lot tighter than most of them have

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:17.480 
a lot tighter than most of them have
been<00:02:15.209> the<00:02:16.170> weak<00:02:16.350> point<00:02:16.650> that<00:02:16.830> I<00:02:16.890> can<00:02:17.069> find<00:02:17.310> on

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:17.490 
been the weak point that I can find on

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:19.850 
been the weak point that I can find on
these<00:02:17.640> so<00:02:17.880> far<00:02:18.180> as<00:02:18.330> the<00:02:18.930> bottom<00:02:19.260> mount<00:02:19.440> here<00:02:19.680> is

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:19.860 
these so far as the bottom mount here is

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:22.820 
these so far as the bottom mount here is
all<00:02:20.130> plastic<00:02:20.600> there<00:02:21.600> is<00:02:21.780> a<00:02:21.810> threaded<00:02:22.440> quarter

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:22.830 
all plastic there is a threaded quarter

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:25.220 
all plastic there is a threaded quarter
twenty<00:02:23.280> metal<00:02:23.730> insert<00:02:24.270> that<00:02:24.510> goes<00:02:24.569> in<00:02:24.930> so<00:02:25.140> you

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:25.230 
twenty metal insert that goes in so you

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:27.020 
twenty metal insert that goes in so you
could<00:02:25.350> screw<00:02:25.620> this<00:02:25.770> directly<00:02:26.130> to<00:02:26.340> a<00:02:26.370> stand<00:02:26.790> and

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:27.030 
could screw this directly to a stand and

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:29.050 
could screw this directly to a stand and
not<00:02:27.239> have<00:02:27.510> a<00:02:27.750> cold<00:02:28.110> shoe<00:02:28.290> attachment<00:02:28.830> to<00:02:28.980> it

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:29.060 
not have a cold shoe attachment to it

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:31.520 
not have a cold shoe attachment to it
but<00:02:30.060> i<00:02:30.090> think<00:02:30.390> this<00:02:30.450> plastic<00:02:30.900> over<00:02:31.110> time<00:02:31.319> is

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:31.530 
but i think this plastic over time is

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:34.809 
but i think this plastic over time is
going<00:02:31.680> to<00:02:31.739> probably<00:02:32.489> be<00:02:32.640> the<00:02:32.850> weakest<00:02:33.239> link

00:02:34.809 --> 00:02:34.819 
going to probably be the weakest link

00:02:34.819 --> 00:02:36.530 
going to probably be the weakest link
now<00:02:35.819> if<00:02:35.940> you're<00:02:36.090> worried<00:02:36.300> about<00:02:36.420> how

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:36.540 
now if you're worried about how

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:38.900 
now if you're worried about how
difficult<00:02:37.050> these<00:02:37.140> may<00:02:37.380> be<00:02:37.410> to<00:02:37.620> use<00:02:37.910> rest

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:38.910 
difficult these may be to use rest

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:40.550 
difficult these may be to use rest
assured<00:02:39.239> they're<00:02:39.510> really<00:02:39.780> easy<00:02:39.810> you'll<00:02:40.380> see

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:40.560 
assured they're really easy you'll see

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:41.870 
assured they're really easy you'll see
on<00:02:40.650> the<00:02:40.769> top<00:02:40.890> there<00:02:41.190> there's<00:02:41.430> an<00:02:41.580> on/off

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:41.880 
on the top there there's an on/off

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:44.270 
on the top there there's an on/off
switch<00:02:42.019> so<00:02:43.019> i<00:02:43.050> going<00:02:43.320> to<00:02:43.410> flip<00:02:43.739> out<00:02:43.920> to<00:02:44.040> the<00:02:44.160> on

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:44.280
