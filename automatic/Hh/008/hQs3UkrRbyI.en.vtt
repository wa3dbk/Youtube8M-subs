00:00:04.749 --> 00:00:09.020
 hello welcome to the first channel 

00:00:07.009 --> 00:00:12.620
 ivonne for this recipe I will use 

00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:14.570
 from 5 to 8 eggs a clove of garlic a 

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:15.170
 bay leaf this is optional if not the 

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:19.190
 they have 

00:00:15.170 --> 00:00:22.070
 it does not matter 4 pieces of prickly pear is 12 

00:00:19.190 --> 00:00:24.470
 guajillo chiles oil to fry salt and 

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:26.080
 consume chicken powder as first 

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:29.090
 step we are going to cook the guajillo chiles 

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:30.770
 I have here the water heating up so 

00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:32.390
 I will add them and I will leave them at 

00:00:30.770 --> 00:00:34.430
 fire until they change color 

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:37.270
 On the other hand we put a casserole 

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:40.820
 fire we add a little oil 

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:42.200
 we beat the eggs just a little salt and 

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:45.440
 once the oil is hot 

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:47.719
 we add half we let it cook 

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:50.630
 well then we remove in a container 

00:00:47.719 --> 00:00:52.579
 and we keep after we add the rest 

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:54.649
 of the game and we do the same 

00:00:52.579 --> 00:00:56.750
 procedure once we have 

00:00:54.649 --> 00:00:59.030
 finished cooking the egg if it is 

00:00:56.750 --> 00:01:01.129
 necessary add a little oil and 

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:02.899
 we add nopales if you do not 

00:01:01.129 --> 00:01:05.230
 they like to do this step they can catch 

00:01:02.899 --> 00:01:09.390
 nopales apart 

00:01:05.230 --> 00:01:12.390
 with water onion and a little salt 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:14.400
 as we see a little and we cover what we are going to 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:16.229
 leave to the fire there are about 5 minutes 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:17.869
 approximately moving him from time to time 

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:20.580
 when so that they are not going to burn 

00:01:17.869 --> 00:01:22.350
 meanwhile the guajillo chiles already 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:23.880
 they're ready I'm going to grind them in the glass 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:27.390
 of the blender together with a tooth of 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:30.060
 garlic and about a half cup of 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:32.430
 water with which they were cooked we come back and 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:34.290
 we keep good here the 5 

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:37.290
 minutes as you can see the nopales already 

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:39.750
 they're almost ready now we're just going to 

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:42.210
 leave without a lid so that all 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:46.350
 the humidity since it has reduced the 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:48.479
 humidity we put the guajillo chile and 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:50.820
 I'm adding about a cup 

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:52.590
 and a half of water that's a matter of 

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:54.159
 tastes the approximate more or less is a 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:57.159
 Cup 

00:01:54.159 --> 00:01:58.749
 Season with powdered chicken broth 

00:01:57.159 --> 00:02:02.530
 I am adding a teaspoon and 

00:01:58.749 --> 00:02:04.569
 medium and just a little bit of good salt 

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:07.119
 here the 8 minutes have passed and what 

00:02:04.569 --> 00:02:09.310
 I wanted to show you is the consistency of 

00:02:07.119 --> 00:02:11.230
 the sauce because many of you are 

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:13.060
 they ask that when you prepare and the 

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:15.040
 nopales that if the sauce remains let's 

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:17.890
 informally there is no slug 

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:20.260
 consistency for me is perfect and 

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:22.660
 well at this time you can 

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:24.940
 add the bay leaf needle that is for 

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:26.860
 Give it a little flavor but it's optional 

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:28.110
 so I'm not going to this time 

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:31.320
 add 

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:32.850
 let's add the egg the egg is 

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:35.130
 It is recommended that you leave it at the end 

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:37.830
 because it absorbs moisture then its 

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:40.950
 chile will be dry so we move 

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:43.320
 we leave about 5 minutes more and it's ready 

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:44.880
 and well, that's how simple we made it 

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:46.980
 our nopales with egg in chile 

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:49.230
 guajillo can accompany it with some 

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:53.150
 refried beans and I hope you have them 

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:53.150
 liked and see you in the next video
