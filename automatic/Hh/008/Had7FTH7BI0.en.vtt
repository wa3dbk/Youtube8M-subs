being<00:01:06.630> a<00:01:06.780> killstreak<00:01:07.140> where<00:01:07.560> if<00:01:07.740> you<00:01:07.920> you<00:01:08.460> get

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
being a killstreak where if you you get

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:10.010 
being a killstreak where if you you get
to<00:01:08.760> a<00:01:08.790> certain<00:01:08.850> amount<00:01:09.150> of<00:01:09.299> kills<00:01:09.479> you<00:01:09.689> can<00:01:09.840> put

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020 
to a certain amount of kills you can put

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:12.230 
to a certain amount of kills you can put
this<00:01:10.140> x-ray<00:01:10.619> vision<00:01:11.010> scope<00:01:11.369> on<00:01:11.580> your<00:01:11.729> gun<00:01:12.000> and

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
this x-ray vision scope on your gun and

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:14.630 
this x-ray vision scope on your gun and
you<00:01:12.840> can<00:01:12.990> see<00:01:13.229> straight<00:01:13.530> through<00:01:13.619> walls<00:01:14.010> and<00:01:14.369> I

you can see straight through walls and I

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:16.969 
you can see straight through walls and I
guess<00:01:14.850> it<00:01:15.030> would<00:01:15.180> show<00:01:15.509> the<00:01:15.780> enemy<00:01:16.110> infrared

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:16.979
