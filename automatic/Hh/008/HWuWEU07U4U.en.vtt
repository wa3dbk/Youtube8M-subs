you don't have to cut it it the plastic
around<00:01:01.500> it<00:01:01.800> just<00:01:02.039> dissolves<00:01:02.190> so<00:01:02.850> just<00:01:03.840> to<00:01:04.350> get

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
around it just dissolves so just to get

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:07.340 
around it just dissolves so just to get
in<00:01:04.589> there<00:01:04.830> and<00:01:05.159> watch<00:01:06.150> it<00:01:06.180> dissolve<00:01:06.510> looks

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350

think<00:01:12.210> it's<00:01:12.420> the<00:01:12.540> colour<00:01:12.750> intensifier<00:01:13.290> that

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
think it's the colour intensifier that

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:15.499 
think it's the colour intensifier that
smells<00:01:13.830> worse<00:01:14.130> well<00:01:14.790> the<00:01:14.939> whole<00:01:15.060> thing<00:01:15.240> smells

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:15.509 
smells worse well the whole thing smells

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:18.170 
smells worse well the whole thing smells
terrible<00:01:15.979> I<00:01:16.979> did<00:01:17.460> turn<00:01:17.670> down<00:01:17.820> the<00:01:17.939> heat<00:01:17.970> to

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
terrible I did turn down the heat to

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:20.450 
terrible I did turn down the heat to
like<00:01:18.540> medium<00:01:19.140> heat<00:01:19.439> but<00:01:19.740> at<00:01:19.830> this<00:01:20.009> point<00:01:20.250> you

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 
like medium heat but at this point you

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:22.010 
like medium heat but at this point you
could<00:01:20.549> actually<00:01:20.729> take<00:01:21.030> it<00:01:21.180> off<00:01:21.360> the<00:01:21.570> heat<00:01:21.780> and

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
could actually take it off the heat and

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:24.469 
could actually take it off the heat and
put<00:01:22.439> it<00:01:22.560> in<00:01:22.650> the<00:01:22.710> bucket<00:01:22.860> and<00:01:23.189> go<00:01:23.369> outside<00:01:23.490> so

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
put it in the bucket and go outside so

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:29.030 
put it in the bucket and go outside so
you<00:01:24.570> don't<00:01:24.750> die<00:01:25.110> of<00:01:25.189> fumes<00:01:26.270> but<00:01:27.270> I<00:01:27.799> guess<00:01:28.799> I<00:01:28.920> was

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 
you don't die of fumes but I guess I was

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:34.440 
you don't die of fumes but I guess I was
brave<00:01:29.280> that<00:01:29.549> day
