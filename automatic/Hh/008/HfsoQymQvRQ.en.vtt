the<00:01:16.329> cross<00:01:16.659> mode<00:01:16.990> radiator<00:01:17.469> mod<00:01:18.240> which<00:01:19.240> is

00:01:19.499 --> 00:01:19.509 
the cross mode radiator mod which is

the cross mode radiator mod which is
done<00:01:19.780> this<00:01:19.990> way<00:01:20.430> make<00:01:21.430> an<00:01:21.579> incision<00:01:21.969> on<00:01:22.210> the

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:22.270 
done this way make an incision on the

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:25.069 
done this way make an incision on the
radiator<00:01:22.750> here<00:01:23.170> and<00:01:23.320> you<00:01:23.979> insert<00:01:24.369> a<00:01:24.549> plate

00:01:25.069 --> 00:01:25.079 
radiator here and you insert a plate

00:01:25.079 --> 00:01:30.270 
radiator here and you insert a plate
okay<00:01:26.079> on<00:01:26.350> this<00:01:26.500> side<00:01:26.740> of<00:01:26.770> the<00:01:26.950> radiator<00:01:27.960> and<00:01:29.280> on

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:30.280 
okay on this side of the radiator and on

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:32.880 
okay on this side of the radiator and on
this<00:01:30.520> other<00:01:30.759> side<00:01:30.909> as<00:01:31.420> well<00:01:31.719> you<00:01:32.409> enter<00:01:32.770> the

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:32.890 
this other side as well you enter the

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:34.499 
this other side as well you enter the
plate<00:01:33.130> in<00:01:33.310> there<00:01:33.460> have<00:01:33.670> it<00:01:33.789> welded<00:01:34.119> back<00:01:34.270> up

00:01:34.499 --> 00:01:34.509 
plate in there have it welded back up

00:01:34.509 --> 00:01:36.779 
plate in there have it welded back up
like<00:01:35.049> that<00:01:35.229> it<00:01:35.380> forces<00:01:35.890> the<00:01:36.009> water<00:01:36.219> to<00:01:36.579> flow

00:01:36.779 --> 00:01:36.789 
like that it forces the water to flow

00:01:36.789 --> 00:01:39.440 
like that it forces the water to flow
through<00:01:36.820> the<00:01:37.270> radiator<00:01:37.659> once<00:01:38.229> or<00:01:38.530> twice

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
through the radiator once or twice

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:43.410 
through the radiator once or twice
before<00:01:40.450> it<00:01:40.719> enters<00:01:41.049> the<00:01:41.259> the<00:01:42.070> engine<00:01:42.460> this

00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:43.420 
before it enters the the engine this

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:46.169 
before it enters the the engine this
works<00:01:43.780> I<00:01:44.140> mean<00:01:44.740> the<00:01:44.950> fan<00:01:45.219> barely<00:01:45.729> comes<00:01:45.969> down

00:01:46.169 --> 00:01:46.179 
works I mean the fan barely comes down

00:01:46.179 --> 00:01:49.130 
works I mean the fan barely comes down
on<00:01:46.329> this<00:01:46.450> thing<00:01:46.719> it<00:01:46.929> keeps<00:01:47.200> it<00:01:47.350> very<00:01:47.380> cool<00:01:47.999> but

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.140 
on this thing it keeps it very cool but

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:52.050 
on this thing it keeps it very cool but
that's<00:01:50.140> not<00:01:50.469> the<00:01:50.590> option<00:01:51.039> up<00:01:51.219> for<00:01:51.490> the<00:01:51.609> mods

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:52.060 
that's not the option up for the mods
