through channels which previously did
not<00:04:00.770> exist<00:04:01.400> so<00:04:01.670> let's<00:04:02.600> go<00:04:02.750> back<00:04:02.959> to<00:04:03.140> the<00:04:03.290> word

00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:03.620 
not exist so let's go back to the word

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:08.310 
not exist so let's go back to the word
damage<00:04:04.160> the<00:04:04.700> problem<00:04:05.150> is<00:04:05.390> that<00:04:06.290> we<00:04:07.280> see<00:04:07.580> people

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:08.320 
damage the problem is that we see people

00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:15.100 
damage the problem is that we see people
getting<00:04:09.320> better<00:04:09.740> in<00:04:10.010> spite<00:04:10.760> of<00:04:11.620> damage<00:04:13.810> now<00:04:14.810> I

00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:15.110 
getting better in spite of damage now I

00:04:15.110 --> 00:04:19.150 
getting better in spite of damage now I
believe<00:04:15.920> that<00:04:15.950> damage<00:04:16.640> can<00:04:17.120> exists<00:04:18.160> I've

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:19.160 
believe that damage can exists I've

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:21.039 
believe that damage can exists I've

00:04:49.090 --> 00:04:49.100 
this with the brain that has turned to

00:04:49.100 --> 00:04:52.659 
this with the brain that has turned to
mush<00:04:50.290> because<00:04:51.290> the<00:04:51.470> brain<00:04:51.680> is<00:04:51.890> no<00:04:52.040> longer<00:04:52.280> fed

mostly dies and there's all kinds and
gradations<00:05:04.669> of<00:05:05.380> damage<00:05:06.380> there<00:05:06.650> are<00:05:06.740> people

00:05:07.090 --> 00:05:07.100 
gradations of damage there are people

00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:10.990 
gradations of damage there are people
who<00:05:07.250> walk<00:05:07.550> around<00:05:08.620> virtually<00:05:09.620> with<00:05:10.550> nothing

00:05:10.990 --> 00:05:11.000 
who walk around virtually with nothing

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:13.750 
who walk around virtually with nothing
inside<00:05:11.330> their<00:05:11.600> skulls<00:05:11.930> and<00:05:12.340> that's<00:05:13.340> apart

00:05:13.750 --> 00:05:13.760 
inside their skulls and that's apart

00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:20.560 
inside their skulls and that's apart
from<00:05:13.850> politicians<00:05:16.419> so<00:05:18.880> you<00:05:19.880> know<00:05:20.000> how<00:05:20.360> do<00:05:20.419> we

00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:20.570 
from politicians so you know how do we

00:05:20.570 --> 00:05:23.650 
from politicians so you know how do we
explain<00:05:21.460> what<00:05:22.460> happens<00:05:22.970> when<00:05:23.180> people<00:05:23.210> are

00:05:23.650 --> 00:05:23.660 
explain what happens when people are

00:05:23.660 --> 00:05:27.940 
explain what happens when people are
walking<00:05:24.110> around<00:05:24.520> with<00:05:25.520> out<00:05:26.030> a<00:05:26.090> hemisphere<00:05:26.990> the

00:05:27.940 --> 00:05:27.950 
walking around with out a hemisphere the

00:05:27.950 --> 00:05:29.710 
walking around with out a hemisphere the
brain<00:05:28.160> has<00:05:28.370> been<00:05:28.550> half<00:05:28.970> the<00:05:29.150> brain<00:05:29.360> has<00:05:29.540> been

00:05:29.710 --> 00:05:29.720 
brain has been half the brain has been

00:05:29.720 --> 00:05:32.670 
brain has been half the brain has been
taken<00:05:30.140> out<00:05:30.260> how<00:05:31.130> do<00:05:31.190> we<00:05:31.370> explain<00:05:31.700> when<00:05:32.030> people

00:05:32.670 --> 00:05:32.680 
taken out how do we explain when people

00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:37.770 
taken out how do we explain when people
are<00:05:33.680> alive<00:05:34.160> and<00:05:34.729> and<00:05:35.270> are<00:05:36.160> functioning<00:05:37.160> with

00:05:37.770 --> 00:05:37.780 
are alive and and are functioning with

00:05:37.780 --> 00:05:42.690 
are alive and and are functioning with
brain<00:05:38.020> that's<00:05:38.590> the<00:05:38.830> size<00:05:39.070> of<00:05:39.310> P<00:05:40.980> these<00:05:41.980> things

00:05:42.690 --> 00:05:42.700 
brain that's the size of P these things

00:05:42.700 --> 00:05:46.170 
brain that's the size of P these things
happen<00:05:43.270> and<00:05:43.420> there<00:05:43.870> are<00:05:44.050> no<00:05:44.680> explanations<00:05:45.180> and

00:05:46.170 --> 00:05:46.180 
happen and there are no explanations and

00:05:46.180 --> 00:05:48.480 
happen and there are no explanations and
there<00:05:46.990> are<00:05:47.080> no<00:05:47.230> explanations<00:05:47.500> for<00:05:48.070> people<00:05:48.370> who

00:05:48.480 --> 00:05:48.490 
there are no explanations for people who

00:05:48.490 --> 00:05:51.780 
there are no explanations for people who
have<00:05:48.760> quote-unquote<00:05:49.510> damage<00:05:50.110> and<00:05:50.580> get<00:05:51.580> better

00:05:51.780 --> 00:05:51.790 
have quote-unquote damage and get better

00:05:51.790 --> 00:05:56.790 
have quote-unquote damage and get better
so<00:05:52.470> what<00:05:53.470> what<00:05:54.400> is<00:05:54.780> going<00:05:55.780> on<00:05:56.169> here<00:05:56.440> and<00:05:56.530> I<00:05:56.590> can

00:06:06.090 --> 00:06:06.100 
it is completely unknown and more

00:06:06.100 --> 00:06:09.120 
it is completely unknown and more
substantiated<00:06:06.669> as<00:06:07.210> time<00:06:07.990> goes<00:06:08.440> on<00:06:08.650> but<00:06:08.950> it's

00:06:09.120 --> 00:06:09.130
