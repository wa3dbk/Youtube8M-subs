factory<00:00:30.090> together<00:00:30.240> it's<00:00:30.660> a<00:00:30.740> two<00:00:31.740> big<00:00:31.949> factors

00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:32.189

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:07.140 
2 3 4 5 6 they would save each

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:08.389 
2 3 4 5 6 they would save each
individual<00:02:07.649> one<00:02:07.799> and<00:02:07.829> put<00:02:08.069> them<00:02:08.190> all<00:02:08.250> together

individual one and put them all together

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:10.910 
individual one and put them all together
now<00:02:09.390> you<00:02:09.450> can<00:02:09.690> do<00:02:09.810> that<00:02:09.989> you<00:02:10.440> get<00:02:10.590> the<00:02:10.709> same

now you can do that you get the same
results<00:02:11.310> in<00:02:11.400> the<00:02:11.489> end<00:02:11.610> but<00:02:12.060> that's<00:02:12.209> really

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:13.030 
results in the end but that's really
