00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:07.560
 very good riffraff that we are with call 

00:00:03.340 --> 00:00:07.560
 of duty truck string 

00:00:08.070 --> 00:00:14.010
 skins and good was against 

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:23.630
 put in five parts but good very 

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:27.279
 easy to download 

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:27.279
 now not 

00:00:31.059 --> 00:00:37.200
 It would be very easy for you to leave the five 

00:00:33.769 --> 00:00:42.050
 parts where the description of the video 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:42.050
 well once downloaded part 1 

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:59.920
 Download 200 parts inside the folder 

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:08.090
 well once we have them 

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:11.780
 we would have 25 easier to give the 

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:15.020
 first the first part will be here yes 

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:17.320
 and he would stay this afternoon 

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:19.670
 ok then we would go to the second 

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:23.060
 we would be here 

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:26.509
 and he would tell us he wants to replace something like that 

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:29.860
 but if you put all if not all 

00:01:26.509 --> 00:01:29.860
 all very easy vouchers 

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:38.200
 we have to tell him he was in 

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:41.530
 Spanish yes to all 

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:45.000
 and so on with this with this 

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:50.780
 with this and with this until what 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:50.780
 we have although the folders and link 

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:59.240
 and very particularly what would we do 

00:01:54.680 --> 00:02:01.510
 after the monitor we would take our 

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:01.510
 provision 

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:07.690
 to see a moment if not 

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:15.390
 well let's say ok we have 

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:17.130
 unzipped to all parties we 

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:19.050
 this folder is left 

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:23.100
 we would already be ours 

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:26.610
 device or mobile tablet what supports 

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:29.190
 that salgado we are going to be at the 

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:30.720
 internal memory or external person and 

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:33.000
 this would be the internal one that they look 

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:35.990
 we may or may not go to the internal in 

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.990
 some puts dedicate 

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:42.320
 once we are here it favors 

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:44.210
 many folders as you see good good 

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:47.600
 android 

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:49.700

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:51.830
 you will have this but the one of the 

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:54.770
 two if not right click anyway 

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:56.360
 if you do not have this new folder or bb 

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:58.740
 folder and create a folder that 

00:02:56.360 --> 00:03:00.840
 call vb and one last and more history 

00:02:58.740 --> 00:03:03.120

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:04.550
 good and the folder that we had 

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:09.290

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:11.780
 we passed it would stay here here is 

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:14.510

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:16.129
 just one of two or you put the 

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:18.500
 sins there 

00:03:16.129 --> 00:03:20.180

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:23.239
 directly 

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:24.739
 and I passed it here where you can copy to 

00:03:23.239 --> 00:03:27.519
 storage root no folder 

00:03:24.739 --> 00:03:27.519

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:31.090
 well once you have it there then 

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:33.940
 simply and disconnect in your 

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:36.380

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:39.050
 have as 

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:41.330
 as I say a file manager 

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:43.340
