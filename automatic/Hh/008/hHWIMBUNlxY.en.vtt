00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.100
 created from the south temperatures above 30 degrees -andalucía Extremadura 

00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:08.679
 in the north the clouds have been spreading and it has started to rain 

00:00:08.679 --> 00:00:11.509
 we see in these images as effectively as he has gone 

00:00:11.509 --> 00:00:16.099
 During the day, the cloud profit has been expanding for good 

00:00:16.099 --> 00:00:19.390
 part of that northern half as I commented 

00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:23.869
 new situation shows us an anticyclone located in the Atlantic and 

00:00:23.869 --> 00:00:27.770
 not too far a center of the peninsular northwest but we see each other 

00:00:27.770 --> 00:00:29.350
 same next 

00:00:29.350 --> 00:00:33.880
 southeast of our geography there is a low pressure center of 

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:39.000
 that between that storm and that anticyclone there remarkable price differences this 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.280
 It is a determining factor for the wind to come and that tomorrow 

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:47.360
 many regions as a man with a certain intensity contributing jica mind 

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:51.770
 make it unpleasant in addition to this circumstance the wind will have to have 

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:55.180
 present that the skies will be very cloudy or covered in the whole slope 

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:59.170
 Cantabrian where there will be rains also there will be points of Navarre 

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:00.580
 Aragón La Rioja 

00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:03.350
 catalonia valencia murcia and baleares 

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:07.390
 and some from eight Basques may be of stormy origin, especially in areas 

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:08.200
 mountainous 

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:10.289
 I can also offer you appreciate 

00:01:10.289 --> 00:01:14.090
 It is likely that whoever gets to snow at high points within the mountain range 

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:17.499
 Cantabrian especially next morning as the day progresses 

00:01:17.499 --> 00:01:21.340
 the clouds will also spread through many other regions of the peninsula 

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:25.109
 but alternating with clear and surely without arriving to produce precipitations 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:30.230
 skies somewhat cloudy in the Canary Islands especially in the north and almost clear in the 

00:01:30.229 --> 00:01:31.780
 south of this archipelago 

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:35.409
 the temperature with this situation tend to fall practically in 

00:01:35.409 --> 00:01:36.620
 all regions 

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:40.840
 so that it is likely that tomorrow will not exceed 25 degrees or 

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:44.510
 even in those southern regions that have been coming lately 

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:48.910
 extremely hot environment and also percent the descent in the north will be 

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:52.980
 much more accused we talked to them about the possibility of snow even and how 

00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:56.790
 you can see then it is likely that in some high regions the maximum 

00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:00.170
 get to be only between 0 and 5 degrees 

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:05.229
 also the varied the panorama in other European capitals maximum of 9 to 10 

00:02:05.229 --> 00:02:08.960
 degrees may have some of the most western like london brussels and 

00:02:08.959 --> 00:02:13.410
 paris with rains and while in lisbon and roma it will logically be 

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:15.779
 its environment much closer to ours 

00:02:15.779 --> 00:02:19.449
 and as for the sea, when the winds increase, there is also a tendency to 

00:02:19.449 --> 00:02:23.939
 worsening areas of thick sea can see in great sun vizcaya to finisterre san 

00:02:23.939 --> 00:02:24.729
 vicente 

00:02:24.729 --> 00:02:26.890
 the part with the talde azores 

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:30.550
 and even in the Canary Islands in the other maritime zones but also 

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:34.000
 will comment the force of the wind will surely be swell with quintero 

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.580
 force value is only managed in short it seems that the 

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:41.540
 worsening is going to occur as we have been announcing especially in the 

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:46.340
 north and in the east where now I intermittent ways and descent from 

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:47.750
 Good afternoon temperatures
