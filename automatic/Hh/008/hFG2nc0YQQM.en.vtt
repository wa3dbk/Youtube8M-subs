 habitual download 32 minutes does not last 

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:39.870

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:58.770
 public I say 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:02.129
 from the download folder a folder 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:04.409

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:06.210
 windows 7 downloads and they will appear 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:09.440

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:18.260
 they wait for 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:25.270
 extract is going to create a folder 

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:28.500
 how you are creating a folder is 

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:31.980
 portable so the game is 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:31.980
 especially portable 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:37.950

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:41.520
 this folder 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:45.370
 Nothing is going on in this folder 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:50.460

00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:50.460

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:53.840

00:01:57.719 --> 00:02:00.049

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:13.760
 m
