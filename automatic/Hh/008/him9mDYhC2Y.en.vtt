00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:28.820 

00:00:28.820 --> 00:01:02.650 

and<00:00:28.970> here<00:00:29.480> is<00:00:29.749> the<00:00:30.050> Jupiter<00:00:30.230> fuzz

00:01:02.650 --> 00:01:02.660 

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:05.420 

so<00:01:03.660> what<00:01:04.320> we<00:01:04.440> have<00:01:04.650> here<00:01:04.680> is<00:01:04.950> an<00:01:05.070> incredibly

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430 
so what we have here is an incredibly

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:08.180 
so what we have here is an incredibly
versatile<00:01:06.270> fuzz<00:01:06.600> from<00:01:06.810> walrus<00:01:07.260> features

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:08.190 
versatile fuzz from walrus features

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:11.300 
versatile fuzz from walrus features
three<00:01:08.490> controls<00:01:08.940> level<00:01:09.540> fuzz<00:01:10.170> and<00:01:10.560> tone<00:01:11.040> and

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
three controls level fuzz and tone and

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:13.220 
three controls level fuzz and tone and
then<00:01:11.610> we<00:01:11.760> have<00:01:11.970> two<00:01:12.270> switches<00:01:12.570> the<00:01:12.900> one<00:01:13.050> on<00:01:13.140> the

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:13.230 
then we have two switches the one on the

00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:16.070 
then we have two switches the one on the
right<00:01:13.410> is<00:01:13.620> a<00:01:13.650> bass<00:01:14.010> switch<00:01:14.370> it<00:01:15.270> allows<00:01:15.540> more<00:01:15.840> of

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 
right is a bass switch it allows more of

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:18.050 
right is a bass switch it allows more of
your<00:01:16.380> guitars<00:01:16.830> low-end<00:01:17.370> to<00:01:17.460> be<00:01:17.580> retained

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
your guitars low-end to be retained

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:19.820 
your guitars low-end to be retained
going<00:01:18.480> through<00:01:18.660> the<00:01:18.780> pedal<00:01:19.020> and<00:01:19.170> then<00:01:19.590> on<00:01:19.740> the

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830 
going through the pedal and then on the

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:22.550 
going through the pedal and then on the
Left<00:01:20.070> we<00:01:20.280> have<00:01:20.310> a<00:01:20.460> mode<00:01:20.820> switch<00:01:21.210> with<00:01:21.570> switches

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
Left we have a mode switch with switches

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:24.770 
Left we have a mode switch with switches
between<00:01:22.940> different<00:01:23.940> clipping<00:01:24.210> options<00:01:24.570> and

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780 
between different clipping options and

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:26.300 
between different clipping options and
so<00:01:25.260> I'm<00:01:25.350> gonna<00:01:25.470> try<00:01:25.770> and<00:01:25.860> go<00:01:25.950> through<00:01:26.130> that<00:01:26.250> a

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
so I'm gonna try and go through that a

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:28.400 
so I'm gonna try and go through that a
little<00:01:26.610> bit<00:01:26.730> now<00:01:26.880> with<00:01:26.940> you<00:01:27.360> so<00:01:27.870> here<00:01:28.110> is<00:01:28.230> the

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:28.410 
little bit now with you so here is the

00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:34.220 
little bit now with you so here is the
clean<00:01:28.620> tone<00:01:28.830> again<00:01:31.190> here<00:01:32.190> is<00:01:32.430> the<00:01:33.230> current

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:34.230 
clean tone again here is the current

00:01:34.230 --> 00:02:28.699 
clean tone again here is the current
switch<00:01:34.800> position

00:02:28.699 --> 00:02:28.709 

00:02:28.709 --> 00:02:31.890 

so<00:02:29.709> there<00:02:30.099> you<00:02:30.220> have<00:02:30.250> a<00:02:30.430> few<00:02:30.819> different<00:02:30.970> switch

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:31.900 
so there you have a few different switch

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:34.559 
so there you have a few different switch
clipping<00:02:32.890> switch<00:02:33.280> options<00:02:33.700> the<00:02:34.300> middle

00:02:34.559 --> 00:02:34.569 
clipping switch options the middle

00:02:34.569 --> 00:02:36.630 
clipping switch options the middle
position<00:02:34.900> is<00:02:35.050> a<00:02:35.080> little<00:02:35.230> bit<00:02:35.470> louder<00:02:35.680> and

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:36.640 
position is a little bit louder and

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:38.880 
position is a little bit louder and
sometimes<00:02:37.420> when<00:02:37.810> you<00:02:37.959> switch<00:02:38.290> to<00:02:38.319> one<00:02:38.739> of<00:02:38.830> the

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:38.890 
sometimes when you switch to one of the

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:40.080 
sometimes when you switch to one of the
other<00:02:39.010> clipping<00:02:39.340> options<00:02:39.640> there<00:02:39.790> it<00:02:39.940> might

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:40.090 
other clipping options there it might

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:41.220 
other clipping options there it might
cut<00:02:40.330> a<00:02:40.360> little<00:02:40.510> bit<00:02:40.599> of<00:02:40.750> the<00:02:40.810> volume<00:02:41.080> so<00:02:41.200> you

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:41.230 
cut a little bit of the volume so you

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:42.809 
cut a little bit of the volume so you
can<00:02:41.290> compensate<00:02:41.620> with<00:02:41.980> that<00:02:42.160> with<00:02:42.400> the<00:02:42.520> level

00:02:42.809 --> 00:02:42.819 
can compensate with that with the level

00:02:42.819 --> 00:02:45.300 
can compensate with that with the level
we<00:02:43.510> won't<00:02:43.690> go<00:02:43.810> through<00:02:43.959> that<00:02:44.050> now<00:02:44.290> that's<00:02:44.980> kind

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:45.310 
we won't go through that now that's kind

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:47.760 
we won't go through that now that's kind
of<00:02:45.400> self-explanatory<00:02:45.870> and<00:02:46.870> so<00:02:47.440> now<00:02:47.560> let's

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:47.770 
of self-explanatory and so now let's

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:50.610 
of self-explanatory and so now let's
look<00:02:47.920> at<00:02:48.069> the<00:02:48.250> base<00:02:49.110> switch<00:02:50.110> on<00:02:50.350> the<00:02:50.500> right

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:50.620 
look at the base switch on the right

00:02:50.620 --> 00:03:12.010 
look at the base switch on the right
hand<00:02:50.830> side<00:02:51.069> there<00:02:51.310> of<00:02:51.489> the<00:02:51.670> tone<00:02:51.880> knob

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:12.020 

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:14.840 

so<00:03:13.020> that<00:03:13.200> is<00:03:13.500> where<00:03:14.190> the<00:03:14.310> switch<00:03:14.490> is<00:03:14.670> now

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:14.850 
so that is where the switch is now

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:17.180 
so that is where the switch is now
currently<00:03:15.420> and<00:03:15.660> that<00:03:15.810> allows<00:03:16.080> more<00:03:16.350> low-end

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:17.190 
currently and that allows more low-end

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:19.220 
currently and that allows more low-end
to<00:03:17.340> come<00:03:17.520> through<00:03:17.760> when<00:03:18.030> we<00:03:18.120> switch<00:03:18.360> it<00:03:18.630> you

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:19.230 
to come through when we switch it you

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:53.979 
to come through when we switch it you
can<00:03:19.380> hear

00:03:53.979 --> 00:03:53.989 

00:03:53.989 --> 00:03:56.990 

so<00:03:54.989> now<00:03:55.860> let's<00:03:56.099> look<00:03:56.160> at<00:03:56.280> the<00:03:56.400> tone<00:03:56.580> knob<00:03:56.790> very

00:03:56.990 --> 00:03:57.000 
so now let's look at the tone knob very

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:00.050 
so now let's look at the tone knob very
quickly<00:03:57.239> I<00:03:57.510> will<00:03:58.019> add<00:03:58.950> the<00:03:59.280> low<00:03:59.430> end<00:03:59.640> back<00:03:59.819> in

00:04:00.050 --> 00:04:00.060 
quickly I will add the low end back in

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:12.430 
quickly I will add the low end back in
and<00:04:00.420> let<00:04:01.349> you<00:04:01.470> just<00:04:01.650> listen

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:12.440 

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:50.040 

let's<00:04:13.190> go<00:04:13.400> to<00:04:13.520> 12<00:04:13.670> o'clock<00:04:14.060> on<00:04:14.240> the<00:04:14.300> tone<00:04:14.600> up

00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:50.050 

00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:52.529 

so<00:04:50.889> there<00:04:51.250> you<00:04:51.280> can<00:04:51.550> hear<00:04:51.759> some<00:04:52.000> differences

00:04:52.529 --> 00:04:52.539 
so there you can hear some differences

00:04:52.539 --> 00:04:54.450 
so there you can hear some differences
in<00:04:52.780> the<00:04:53.080> tone<00:04:53.680> options<00:04:54.190> that<00:04:54.310> are<00:04:54.430> available

00:04:54.450 --> 00:04:54.460 
in the tone options that are available

00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:56.520 
in the tone options that are available
with<00:04:54.849> this<00:04:54.970> pedal<00:04:55.150> now<00:04:55.720> let's<00:04:55.960> just<00:04:56.139> look<00:04:56.289> at

00:04:56.520 --> 00:04:56.530 
with this pedal now let's just look at

00:04:56.530 --> 00:05:00.570 
with this pedal now let's just look at
the<00:04:56.680> fuzz<00:04:56.860> knob<00:04:57.129> and<00:04:58.470> we'll<00:04:59.470> turn<00:05:00.099> it<00:05:00.250> to<00:05:00.340> 12

00:05:00.570 --> 00:05:00.580 
the fuzz knob and we'll turn it to 12

00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:03.899 
the fuzz knob and we'll turn it to 12
o'clock<00:05:00.849> and<00:05:01.330> then<00:05:01.720> we<00:05:01.870> will<00:05:02.020> try<00:05:02.400> the<00:05:03.400> expense

00:05:03.899 --> 00:05:03.909 
o'clock and then we will try the expense

00:05:03.909 --> 00:06:12.490 
o'clock and then we will try the expense
of<00:05:04.210> this<00:05:04.360> fuzz<00:05:04.659> fuzz<00:05:05.050> knob<00:05:05.319> so<00:05:05.530> here<00:05:05.680> we<00:05:05.740> go
