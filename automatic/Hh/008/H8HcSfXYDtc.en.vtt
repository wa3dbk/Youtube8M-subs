00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.069
 Hello everyone in this video I will talk to you 

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.140
 of the books I read for the month of 

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:09.030
 April broken areas not seen 

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:11.700
 further with all the cars of 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:14.340
 pagan yoshimoto that I made myself though 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:17.640
 if any of you interested can 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:20.400
 directly find hd videos cases 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:24.150
 I am in collaboration with not only 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:27.090
 japan then sat you find them here 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:29.970
 always in my channel the theme 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:33.180
 banana yoshimoto I read the world of 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:36.540
 giorgio's banana yoshimoto amitrano one 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:38.760
 of the principal among the doctors of the works 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:42.450
 of absences as well as professor 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:45.690
 at the eastern university of naples 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:47.789
 and in this book we collect the 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:50.670
 interviews he did with banana 

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:53.309
 yoshimoto and a second part there is a 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:57.329
 wise I especially liked the 

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:59.399
 first interview I must be honest then 

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:01.590
 sometimes there are images of 

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:04.949
 nara the aces moso an artist who 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:07.580
 collaborates with banana yoshimoto e 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:11.760
 disappointment the covers of his works 

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:14.159
 and in fact I recommend this book 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:16.020
 to banana yoshimoto lovers to those 

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:19.110
 who wanted to know more in detail 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:22.020
 some personal taste of the writer 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:27.330
 some good gem for the 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:31.710
 super web edition enthusiasts 

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:35.430
 here is that anyway feltrinelli 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:38.040
 then I said to myself of the now of south of the 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:41.340
 border to the west of the murakami sun 

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:44.390
 haruki then I could of this book 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:47.240
 talk about it indefinitely but I won't 

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:49.799
 because it really would be one thing 

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:51.990
 hallucinating in my opinion so I do not want 

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:56.820
 spoil you nothing because I think it is 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:59.369
 a gem to be enjoyed just like 

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:03.060
 autumn spheres reminds of norwegian wood 

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:07.340
 however in much more mature tones as far as 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:10.470
 it concerns me just tells briefly 

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:12.630
 the childhood of hajime who is a boy 

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:15.930
 who will meet name de gaulle 

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:20.330
 I never remember a little girl shiva moto 

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:22.980
 he has problems with his leg, in fact he limps 

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:26.790
 they will become very good friends also because e 

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:30.180
 two are both unique sons and children 

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:32.910
 late 1950s Japan and let's say one 

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:38.570
 very electorate so let's say that 

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:42.600
 in their solitude and alienation 

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:45.930
 let's say they meet and one will be born 

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:47.940
 beautiful deep friendship ie there 

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:51.540
 they are fantastic images when 

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:54.960
 he goes to her house and listens to i 

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:57.960
 that is, father's vinyls are 

00:02:54.960 --> 00:03:00.270
 beautiful images this time and 

00:02:57.960 --> 00:03:03.570
 advice to music lovers 

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:07.880
 because there are many references to songs 

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:12.120
 jazz really nice then anyway 

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:15.510
 tells the story of this hajime 

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:18.930
 this little boy who will then become quiet 

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:21.390
 much adult will talk about his 

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:23.820
 teenage experiences both for how long 

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:26.910
 it's about the girls that life in 

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:29.940
 general really is very very nice and 

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:32.450
 where, unfortunately, you will lose from 

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:36.060
 view to these two friends because the 

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:38.700
 girl will be transferred food if 

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:41.370
 I'm not wrong though, rica won't want to ask 

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:44.600
 who will meet again after so many 

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:48.230
 years when they already have families 

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:51.440
 various complications and the two yes 

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:53.720
 they will find themselves really beautiful not me 

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:56.090
 I want to strip of anything 

00:03:53.720 --> 00:04:00.739
 read it for my advice if 

00:03:56.090 --> 00:04:05.420
 you are a lover of well-written stories 

00:04:00.739 --> 00:04:10.340
 really murakami music 

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:13.459
 poetic and delicate and also very intimate 

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:16.100
 and introspective in my opinion let me know 

00:04:13.459 --> 00:04:18.979
 if you have read it what do you think why? 

00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:21.260
 I am very curious finally I read a 

00:04:18.979 --> 00:04:23.680
 kinsella book because at least one 

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:26.720
 once a month you have to read kinsella 

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:29.780
 that is, and memories of me 

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:32.690
 this book is briefly told the 

00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:37.250
 lexie adventures of a young woman who a 

00:04:32.690 --> 00:04:40.430
 book start at age 25 working in one 

00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:43.760
 studio is a secretary but in short it is a 

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:45.590
 unlucky never a good one 

00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:49.220
 there is a boyfriend who does not understand her 

00:04:45.590 --> 00:04:52.039
 in short, it is really bad and then 

00:04:49.220 --> 00:04:56.060
 uncertain precisely she will wake up later 

00:04:52.039 --> 00:04:58.729
 three years in a hospital bed for 

00:04:56.060 --> 00:05:01.550
 caused an accident and lost his memory 

00:04:58.729 --> 00:05:03.979
 but it's not like he did the accidents 

00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:04.340
 when he was 25 he did it at 28 

00:05:03.979 --> 00:05:07.039
 years 

00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:09.710
 but when to be awake those three 

00:05:07.039 --> 00:05:12.349
 years are completely black out her 

00:05:09.710 --> 00:05:16.940
 no longer remembers anything and will have to 

00:05:12.349 --> 00:05:18.620
 rediscover so many things, not his own 

00:05:16.940 --> 00:05:23.419
 husband because in the meantime it was 

00:05:18.620 --> 00:05:27.860
 married changed tastes and friendships is 

00:05:23.419 --> 00:05:31.400
 became the boss the boss of his 

00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:33.380
 there really is situations 

00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:35.750
 completely different from three years ago 

00:05:33.380 --> 00:05:38.300
 and therefore we will have to see what it is 

00:05:35.750 --> 00:05:41.419
 success in the meantime and if the will return 

00:05:38.300 --> 00:05:43.310
 memory and what will happen a book a 

00:05:41.419 --> 00:05:46.550
 very very funny always in 

00:05:43.310 --> 00:05:50.599
 the kinsella perfect style the Roman comi 

00:05:46.550 --> 00:05:51.710
 especially thoughtful, especially the 

00:05:50.599 --> 00:05:54.550
 the final 

00:05:51.710 --> 00:05:57.320
 let me know on the pt bed then 

00:05:54.550 --> 00:05:59.810

00:05:57.320 --> 00:06:02.330
 bed that was about a dozen 

00:05:59.810 --> 00:06:05.060
 small freely read a lot 

00:06:02.330 --> 00:06:08.840
 quickly in half a day 

00:06:05.060 --> 00:06:11.060
 I finished if he had the questions with him 

00:06:08.840 --> 00:06:13.640
