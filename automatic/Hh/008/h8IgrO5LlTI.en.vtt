00:00:14.089 --> 00:00:14.099 
about the ins warm-ups tool that we we

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:18.200 
about the ins warm-ups tool that we we
have<00:00:14.309> made<00:00:14.549> here<00:00:15.030> in<00:00:15.210> whole<00:00:16.970> obviously<00:00:17.970> it's<00:00:18.090> a

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:18.210 
have made here in whole obviously it's a

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:26.950 
have made here in whole obviously it's a
reproduction<00:00:18.900> but<00:00:22.160> here<00:00:23.160> it<00:00:23.310> is<00:00:23.490> now<00:00:24.949> right<00:00:25.949> um

00:00:26.950 --> 00:00:26.960 
reproduction but here it is now right um

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:29.089 
reproduction but here it is now right um
yeah<00:00:27.960> the<00:00:28.080> reason<00:00:28.199> why<00:00:28.439> we<00:00:28.619> have<00:00:28.769> the<00:00:28.890> made

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:29.099 
yeah the reason why we have the made

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:32.990 
yeah the reason why we have the made
here<00:00:29.400> is<00:00:29.640> it<00:00:30.570> just<00:00:31.019> allows<00:00:31.320> us<00:00:31.349> to<00:00:31.949> to<00:00:32.820> have<00:00:32.969> a

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:33.000 
here is it just allows us to to have a

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.569 
here is it just allows us to to have a
lot<00:00:33.180> more<00:00:33.210> control<00:00:33.540> with<00:00:34.200> the<00:00:34.500> with<00:00:35.399> the

00:00:35.569 --> 00:00:35.579 
lot more control with the with the

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:39.819 
lot more control with the with the
manufacturing<00:00:36.239> of<00:00:36.420> them<00:00:37.370> I've<00:00:38.370> tried<00:00:38.670> to<00:00:38.820> find

00:00:39.819 --> 00:00:39.829 
manufacturing of them I've tried to find

00:00:39.829 --> 00:00:42.260 
manufacturing of them I've tried to find
reproductions<00:00:40.829> on<00:00:41.219> my<00:00:41.399> troubles<00:00:41.790> in<00:00:41.940> in

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270 
reproductions on my troubles in in

I've never really found anything that
comes<00:00:48.120> close<00:00:48.300> to<00:00:48.930> the<00:00:49.079> to<00:00:50.039> the<00:00:50.190> to<00:00:50.700> the

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820 
comes close to the to the to the

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:56.360 
comes close to the to the to the
original<00:00:53.510> right<00:00:54.510> okay<00:00:54.899> so<00:00:54.960> just<00:00:55.559> miss<00:00:56.100> it<00:00:56.129> this

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370 
original right okay so just miss it this

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:59.930 
original right okay so just miss it this
is<00:00:56.550> clusters<00:00:57.000> the<00:00:57.469> the<00:00:58.469> a<00:00:58.770> as<00:00:59.250> opposed<00:00:59.640> to<00:00:59.760> the

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
is clusters the the a as opposed to the

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:05.210 
is clusters the the a as opposed to the
B<00:01:00.090> in<00:01:00.239> the<00:01:00.390> city<00:01:02.539> it<00:01:03.539> is<00:01:03.690> solid<00:01:04.110> walnut<00:01:04.379> so<00:01:05.100> it's

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
B in the city it is solid walnut so it's

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:09.530 
B in the city it is solid walnut so it's
actually<00:01:05.369> it's<00:01:05.939> very<00:01:06.030> heavy<00:01:07.280> and<00:01:08.299> it's<00:01:09.299> made

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
actually it's very heavy and it's made

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:15.109 
actually it's very heavy and it's made
up<00:01:09.780> of<00:01:11.270> thinking<00:01:12.270> about<00:01:12.330> 27<00:01:13.110> or<00:01:13.200> 28<00:01:14.119> individual

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:15.119 
up of thinking about 27 or 28 individual

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:17.810 
up of thinking about 27 or 28 individual
pieces<00:01:15.830> there's<00:01:16.830> like<00:01:16.950> three<00:01:17.189> sections<00:01:17.700> to

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
pieces there's like three sections to

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:23.090 
pieces there's like three sections to
each<00:01:18.380> turned<00:01:19.380> by<00:01:19.950> the<00:01:19.979> the<00:01:20.580> woodturner<00:01:21.979> but<00:01:22.979> it

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
each turned by the the woodturner but it

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:26.090 
each turned by the the woodturner but it
is<00:01:23.250> really<00:01:23.850> is<00:01:24.060> a<00:01:24.090> stunning<00:01:24.659> piece<00:01:24.689> and<00:01:25.530> as<00:01:25.979> I

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
is really is a stunning piece and as I

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:27.800 
is really is a stunning piece and as I
say<00:01:26.250> we<00:01:26.430> have<00:01:26.580> because<00:01:27.150> we<00:01:27.299> have<00:01:27.330> them<00:01:27.570> made

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
say we have because we have them made

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:33.319 
say we have because we have them made
here<00:01:29.780> it<00:01:31.430> you<00:01:32.430> know<00:01:32.549> it's<00:01:32.880> always<00:01:33.030> going<00:01:33.240> to<00:01:33.270> be

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:33.329 
here it you know it's always going to be

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:37.010 
here it you know it's always going to be
fairly<00:01:33.600> for<00:01:34.140> a<00:01:34.170> fairly<00:01:34.590> expensive<00:01:34.890> piece<00:01:36.020> you

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020 
fairly for a fairly expensive piece you

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:38.810 
fairly for a fairly expensive piece you
know<00:01:37.110> walnut<00:01:37.619> whose<00:01:37.890> a<00:01:38.009> is<00:01:38.220> a<00:01:38.280> very<00:01:38.490> expensive

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820 
know walnut whose a is a very expensive

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:41.149 
know walnut whose a is a very expensive
hardwood<00:01:39.659> and<00:01:39.930> obviously<00:01:40.619> you've<00:01:40.740> got<00:01:40.770> to<00:01:40.920> pay

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
hardwood and obviously you've got to pay

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:44.389 
hardwood and obviously you've got to pay
for<00:01:41.490> the<00:01:41.610> the<00:01:42.030> wood<00:01:42.210> as<00:01:42.780> well<00:01:43.040> the<00:01:44.040> reason<00:01:44.310> why

00:01:44.389 --> 00:01:44.399 
for the the wood as well the reason why

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:46.160 
for the the wood as well the reason why
I<00:01:44.759> think<00:01:44.880> the<00:01:45.149> main<00:01:45.329> reasons<00:01:45.689> why<00:01:45.810> I'm<00:01:45.899> doing

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170 
I think the main reasons why I'm doing

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:49.010 
I think the main reasons why I'm doing
this<00:01:46.229> video<00:01:46.439> is<00:01:46.829> because<00:01:47.750> certain<00:01:48.750> things

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
this video is because certain things

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:52.639 
this video is because certain things
translate<00:01:49.590> better<00:01:50.659> on<00:01:51.659> the<00:01:51.930> internet<00:01:52.350> than

00:01:52.639 --> 00:01:52.649 
translate better on the internet than

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:56.270 
translate better on the internet than
other<00:01:53.340> pieces<00:01:54.020> and<00:01:55.020> what<00:01:55.229> tend<00:01:55.530> to<00:01:55.680> find<00:01:55.920> is

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:56.280 
other pieces and what tend to find is

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:00.440 
other pieces and what tend to find is
we're<00:01:57.000> not<00:01:57.090> selling<00:01:57.479> many<00:01:57.659> of<00:01:57.840> these<00:01:58.579> and<00:01:59.579> the
