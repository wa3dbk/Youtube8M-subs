00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:36.980 
not a little strategy that I've been

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:39.310 
not a little strategy that I've been
using<00:03:37.220> watching<00:03:37.820> a<00:03:37.880> few<00:03:38.060> other<00:03:38.180> guys<00:03:38.420> so<00:03:39.050> any

using watching a few other guys so any

00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:40.570 
using watching a few other guys so any
what<00:03:39.470> we're<00:03:39.590> gonna<00:03:39.680> go<00:03:39.830> ahead<00:03:39.890> and<00:03:40.040> moved<00:03:40.340> onto

00:03:40.570 --> 00:03:40.580 
what we're gonna go ahead and moved onto

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:43.690 
what we're gonna go ahead and moved onto
some<00:03:40.940> assistance<00:03:41.450> work<00:03:41.690> I<00:03:41.959> went<00:03:42.590> and<00:03:42.890> did<00:03:43.130> I

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:43.700 
some assistance work I went and did I

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:47.080 
some assistance work I went and did I
think<00:03:43.970> five<00:03:44.270> sets<00:03:44.930> of<00:03:45.640> well<00:03:46.640> I<00:03:46.670> think<00:03:46.790> it<00:03:46.970> was

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:47.090 
think five sets of well I think it was

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:48.729 
think five sets of well I think it was
four<00:03:47.330> sets<00:03:47.600> of<00:03:47.720> pull<00:03:47.930> up<00:03:48.110> so<00:03:48.260> I<00:03:48.290> pretty<00:03:48.650> much

00:03:48.729 --> 00:03:48.739 
four sets of pull up so I pretty much

00:03:48.739 --> 00:03:53.080 
four sets of pull up so I pretty much
alternated<00:03:49.520> my<00:03:49.670> grip<00:03:49.970> I<00:03:50.270> did<00:03:50.840> two<00:03:51.370> sets<00:03:52.370> of<00:03:52.700> ten

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:53.090 
alternated my grip I did two sets of ten

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:56.199 
alternated my grip I did two sets of ten
reps<00:03:53.980> with<00:03:54.980> the<00:03:55.010> neutral<00:03:55.550> grip<00:03:55.760> and<00:03:56.000> then<00:03:56.090> I

00:03:56.199 --> 00:03:56.209 
reps with the neutral grip and then I

00:03:56.209 --> 00:03:58.270 
reps with the neutral grip and then I
went<00:03:56.390> ahead<00:03:56.510> and<00:03:56.780> did<00:03:56.900> the<00:03:57.140> regular<00:03:57.350> chin-up

00:03:58.270 --> 00:03:58.280 
went ahead and did the regular chin-up

00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:01.380 
went ahead and did the regular chin-up
underhand<00:03:58.970> grip<00:03:59.090> for<00:03:59.930> ten<00:04:00.200> reps<00:04:00.530> for<00:04:00.770> two<00:04:00.800> sets

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:01.390 
underhand grip for ten reps for two sets

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:03.370 
underhand grip for ten reps for two sets
so<00:04:02.390> pretty<00:04:02.630> much<00:04:02.780> just<00:04:02.840> getting<00:04:03.230> a<00:04:03.260> little

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:03.380 
so pretty much just getting a little

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:05.260 
so pretty much just getting a little
hypertrophy<00:04:04.160> in<00:04:04.340> that's<00:04:04.580> the<00:04:04.670> whole<00:04:04.850> point<00:04:05.120> of

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:05.270 
hypertrophy in that's the whole point of

00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:06.820 
hypertrophy in that's the whole point of
doing<00:04:05.420> assistance<00:04:06.110> work<00:04:06.320> you<00:04:06.470> want<00:04:06.650> to<00:04:06.739> go

doing assistance work you want to go

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:08.470 
doing assistance work you want to go
ahead<00:04:06.890> and<00:04:07.070> build<00:04:07.400> some<00:04:07.700> muscle<00:04:08.150> along<00:04:08.420> with

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:08.480 
ahead and build some muscle along with

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:09.000

the

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:09.010

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:13.150 
the very beginning so then I went here

to<00:04:13.180> move<00:04:13.450> them<00:04:13.660> to<00:04:13.870> someone<00:04:14.260> armed<00:04:14.920> dumbbell

about five sets of this on each arm Wow
I<00:04:23.800> believe<00:04:24.160> I<00:04:24.370> think<00:04:24.580> I<00:04:24.639> did<00:04:24.850> like<00:04:25.120> what<00:04:25.389> ten

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:25.720

it's<00:04:25.930> worth<00:04:26.080> of<00:04:26.169> reps<00:04:26.470> like<00:04:26.680> he<00:04:26.830> said<00:04:27.160> I<00:04:27.460> think

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:27.880 
it's worth of reps like he said I think

00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:29.610 
it's worth of reps like he said I think
I<00:04:27.940> might<00:04:27.970> have<00:04:28.240> just<00:04:28.419> stuck<00:04:28.630> at<00:04:28.780> ten<00:04:29.050> reps<00:04:29.350> so

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:29.620 
I might have just stuck at ten reps so

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:33.000 
I might have just stuck at ten reps so

crazy<00:05:48.729> so<00:05:49.539> I<00:05:49.600> got<00:05:49.780> my<00:05:49.900> dip<00:05:50.139> belt<00:05:50.410> and<00:05:50.590> I<00:05:50.620> got

00:05:50.760 --> 00:05:50.770 
crazy so I got my dip belt and I got

00:05:50.770 --> 00:05:53.940 
crazy so I got my dip belt and I got
that<00:05:50.950> 45<00:05:51.400> pound<00:05:51.700> place<00:05:52.060> so<00:05:52.470> guess<00:05:53.470> what's<00:05:53.710> up<00:05:53.860> I

00:05:53.940 --> 00:05:53.950 
that 45 pound place so guess what's up I

00:05:53.950 --> 00:05:56.190 
that 45 pound place so guess what's up I
did<00:05:54.099> about<00:05:54.340> I<00:05:54.639> think<00:05:54.970> 15<00:05:55.479> reps<00:05:55.780> for<00:05:56.080> these

00:05:56.190 --> 00:05:56.200 
did about I think 15 reps for these

00:05:56.200 --> 00:05:58.680 
did about I think 15 reps for these
first<00:05:56.500> two<00:05:56.680> sets<00:05:57.130> then<00:05:57.789> I<00:05:57.820> when<00:05:58.090> I'm<00:05:58.389> put<00:05:58.570> on

00:05:58.680 --> 00:05:58.690 
first two sets then I when I'm put on

00:05:58.690 --> 00:06:01.320 
first two sets then I when I'm put on
another<00:05:59.020> 45<00:05:59.680> pound<00:06:00.010> plate<00:06:00.400> to<00:06:00.880> go<00:06:01.030> with<00:06:01.210> the

00:06:01.320 --> 00:06:01.330 
another 45 pound plate to go with the

00:06:01.330 --> 00:06:03.690 
another 45 pound plate to go with the
other<00:06:01.570> one<00:06:01.870> so<00:06:02.110> y'all<00:06:02.680> know<00:06:02.860> we<00:06:02.979> imagine<00:06:03.550> over

00:06:03.690 --> 00:06:03.700 
other one so y'all know we imagine over

00:06:03.700 --> 00:06:05.700 
other one so y'all know we imagine over
here<00:06:04.030> we're<00:06:04.750> not<00:06:04.870> really<00:06:05.080> matching<00:06:05.349> because

00:06:05.700 --> 00:06:05.710 
here we're not really matching because

00:06:05.710 --> 00:06:07.150 
here we're not really matching because
one<00:06:05.919> is<00:06:06.070> gray

00:06:07.150 --> 00:06:07.160 
one is gray

00:06:07.160 --> 00:06:11.230 
one is gray
so<00:06:08.110> nevermind<00:06:09.110> so<00:06:09.380> anyway<00:06:09.680> I<00:06:10.130> waited<00:06:10.820> it<00:06:10.970> about

00:06:11.230 --> 00:06:11.240 
so nevermind so anyway I waited it about

00:06:11.240 --> 00:06:14.830 
so nevermind so anyway I waited it about
I<00:06:11.780> think<00:06:11.930> 12<00:06:12.410> reps<00:06:12.830> for<00:06:13.400> two<00:06:13.430> sets<00:06:13.630> with<00:06:14.630> this

00:06:14.830 --> 00:06:14.840 
I think 12 reps for two sets with this

00:06:14.840 --> 00:06:17.020 
I think 12 reps for two sets with this
amount<00:06:15.110> of<00:06:15.290> waste<00:06:15.530> so<00:06:15.830> this<00:06:16.310> is<00:06:16.460> a<00:06:16.490> real<00:06:16.700> handy

00:06:17.020 --> 00:06:17.030 
amount of waste so this is a real handy

00:06:17.030 --> 00:06:18.100 
amount of waste so this is a real handy
