00:00:01.350 --> 00:00:05.980
 I 'm going to show a defect now a 

00:00:03.850 --> 00:00:07.870
 defect in a coil ora 

00:00:05.980 --> 00:00:10.840
 function does not work, it is giving a 

00:00:07.870 --> 00:00:12.490
 defect getting the bile looks like 

00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:14.710
 You 're there a hundred and a few. 

00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:17.230
 kilometers per hour and 129 more or less 

00:00:14.710 --> 00:00:20.019
 a case to fail day does not ensure the 

00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:21.970
 loose and give that defect you go 

00:00:20.019 --> 00:00:24.310
 there may be pressure fuel pump 

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:27.579
 low but in this case it has been changed to 

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:30.429
 pump but not solved coil hour has 

00:00:27.579 --> 00:00:32.970
 Spark has not I had a test here 

00:00:30.429 --> 00:00:37.240
 here when he failed I took the 

00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:39.130
 the first cylinder cable had not 

00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:42.850
 Sparkle hold a little makes her want 

00:00:39.130 --> 00:00:46.150
 the return then a coil defect 

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:48.220
 time works time does not work is one 

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:50.470
 well scoundrel defect that happens the 

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:55.570
 scanner moves to it moves to who does not 

00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:58.720
 I think the coil defect is the first 

00:00:55.570 --> 00:01:02.550
 cylinder must have an album 4 it too 

00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:02.550
 It's talking about working together. 

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:09.340
 static it works without distributor 

00:01:06.369 --> 00:01:12.009
 she here knows the time to send 

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:14.770
 for each new fault and for 

00:01:12.009 --> 00:01:17.499
 you car most of the time in the 

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:19.659
 cold part he has not ment failure 

00:01:17.499 --> 00:01:22.090
 after he heats it presents 

00:01:19.659 --> 00:01:24.280
 this billing defect and step on the 

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:29.020
 accelerator goes weak and citigroup it 

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:33.670
 accelerate and unplug and sometimes even 

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:35.740
 walk again he fails again obina 

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:39.159
 sometimes and I could not take the test and 

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:42.850
 take care not to take a shock 

00:01:39.159 --> 00:01:45.939
 that the high voltage on the coil sends you 

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:48.819
 may be putting a new coil 

00:01:45.939 --> 00:01:53.880
 make a test to decide whether slew of 

00:01:48.819 --> 00:01:56.109
 effect are inscribed in the videos 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:58.299
 who is usually enrolled I

 I respond more easily because 

00:01:58.299 --> 00:02:00.490
 the inscribed that lennon and prestige the
