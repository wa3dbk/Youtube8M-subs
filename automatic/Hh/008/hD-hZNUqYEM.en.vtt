 on the dough you can so that they are evenly 

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:07.300
 everywhere got 

00:03:09.819 --> 00:03:19.590

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:28.329
 nothing is wrong in the flour we bathe 

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:31.780

00:04:32.039 --> 00:04:38.580
 completely melt it altogether 

00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:43.449
 sugar turns sweet 

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:45.400
 by the way we have prepared sugar cake 

00:04:43.449 --> 00:04:51.090
 sweetness gives flour 

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:55.900
 as if volume of oil is shiny 

00:04:51.090 --> 00:04:57.930

00:04:55.900 --> 00:05:02.530
 oil and while we 

00:04:57.930 --> 00:05:05.729
 cools we check prepared or at us 

00:05:02.530 --> 00:05:05.729
 pie and get it 

00:05:08.090 --> 00:05:16.630

00:05:09.710 --> 00:05:19.729

00:05:16.630 --> 00:05:21.669
 some of the berries we still burst but 

00:05:19.729 --> 00:05:24.910
 nothing wrong 

00:05:21.669 --> 00:05:28.430
 we get with the help of the steamer 

00:05:24.910 --> 00:05:29.260
 so while we do not use fully 

00:05:28.430 --> 00:05:48.410
 got cold 

00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:51.169
 I put on top of the cupcake and so I covered 

00:05:48.410 --> 00:05:52.550
 chocolate-coated cupcake and us 

00:05:51.169 --> 00:05:56.720

00:05:52.550 --> 00:05:59.180
 I will decorate with berries and currants that is 

00:05:56.720 --> 00:06:09.260
 Basically you can steal for anyone on 

00:05:59.180 --> 00:06:11.539
