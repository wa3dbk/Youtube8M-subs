 This aspect I hope that you 

00:00:52.399 --> 00:00:58.159
 help us to understand it, I 

00:00:54.500 --> 00:01:00.409
 I will try to tell us where we are and what we are 

00:00:58.159 --> 00:01:02.210
 do here we see batman here and 

00:01:00.409 --> 00:01:03.619
 nightwing they united to 

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:07.729
 hunt down the penguin 

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:09.890
 they found the hiding places with weapons that 

00:01:07.729 --> 00:01:11.950
 intended for penguins for other people 

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:15.290
 in gotham city 

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:17.930
 are you trying to track down the villain 

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:20.180
 in the role of batman we will get inside and already 

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:25.759
 from there we start the fight shoulder to shoulder 

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:28.040
 kung classic batman appearance 

00:01:25.759 --> 00:01:33.440
 right through the glass on the roof and we immediately 

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:34.040
 plunge into battle tell in context 

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:38.330
 dual play 

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:40.549
 what's going on here both of you are fighting 

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:42.560
 simultaneously artificial intelligence 

00:01:40.549 --> 00:01:45.110
 manages partner and at any time 

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:46.729
 can switch to niteving there 

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:49.130
 ability to do dual combo with 

00:01:46.729 --> 00:01:49.580
 batman you see opponents what you need 

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:52.460
 to fill up 

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:54.710
 switch to naytvinga if super 

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:59.299
 combo in charge is normal then you can immediately 

00:01:54.710 --> 00:02:01.490
 use this against enemy super dual 

00:01:59.299 --> 00:02:03.790
 combo is an epic moment when two 

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:05.049
 heroes come together to knock out 

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:07.970
 the criminal 

00:02:05.049 --> 00:02:10.099
 if your super combo charge is replenished with 

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:13.370
 the last blow you can immediately 

00:02:10.099 --> 00:02:15.409
 knock out an opponent what about others 

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:17.989
 elements of the combat system we can 

00:02:15.409 --> 00:02:22.159
 understand the weapons of the earth double final 

00:02:17.989 --> 00:02:24.189
 blow but dual play as it is built on 

00:02:22.159 --> 00:02:27.290
 all these systems 

00:02:24.189 --> 00:02:29.810
 but it is as if the whole is no 

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:34.219
 separate systems everything lies on freeflow 

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:36.529
 combat system are you in the studio rocksteady with 

00:02:34.219 --> 00:02:37.099
 first day and boevka what started sarcoma 

00:02:36.529 --> 00:02:38.660
 asaylum 

00:02:37.099 --> 00:02:42.500
 it came from your 

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:44.930
 heads well yes probably it is possible and so 

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:47.780
 say but of course the result comes 

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:49.370
 from team work we worked with 

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:51.650
 afton and with the rest 

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:55.670
 in order to develop a combat concept 

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:57.410
 systems what is it to realize that you 

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:58.160
 one of the key people in the process 

00:02:57.410 --> 00:03:00.650
 create 

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:05.210
 at this moment such an expandable combat 

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:08.840
 system is incredible when you think why 

00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:11.150
 it all started and what we achieved yes it 

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:13.730
 really cool remember the very beginning 

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:16.640
 sarki lama when they were only 

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:18.440
 sketches and so on but now it's 

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:20.660
 of course the merit of the whole team but 

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:25.420
 Naturally, the success of past games 

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:25.420
 allowed us to once again improve the game 

00:03:28.210 --> 00:03:34.330
 batman and nightwing commits the absolute 

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:36.920
 sweep the building battle just epic 

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:39.230
 number of opponents what is there 

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:41.480
 reflected in the statistics we obviously 

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:42.520
 increased the number since the room is already 

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:45.200
 two heroes 

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:47.300
 Tim I think dual play will be one 

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:49.370
 of those writes that people will be crazy 

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:51.860
 happy when they start playing batman knight 

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:54.140
 arkhema you did a wonderful job 

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:55.640
 but I know that you have a lot of work and 

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:58.370
 now you will not return 

00:03:55.640 --> 00:04:00.610
 thanks for taking the time i'm on a 

00:03:58.370 --> 00:04:00.610
 gun 

00:04:02.460 --> 00:04:07.590
 hello guys i'm some kind of random and you 

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:09.540
 you know what I create video for the game so 

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:11.820
 what subscribe to valentine ebanu channel 

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:15.900
 how else it seems that the scarecrow made 

00:04:11.820 --> 00:04:20.220
 people leave gotham than you filled 

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:22.500
 the city to have something to do 

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:25.110
 Gotham is full of action we have developed 

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:27.240
 special uprising system when different 

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:29.730
 Criminals robbed a half-empty city 

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:32.370
 batman can intervene anytime 

00:04:29.730 --> 00:04:35.070
 in addition we have military troops that 

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:38.340
 obey the knight arkham therefore they 

00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:40.170
 will join the course of the game will be the Titanic 

00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:43.260
 other types of transport 

00:04:40.170 --> 00:04:45.240
 as well as aerial drones are also workers 

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:48.210
 ambulance who need 

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:51.900
 salvation in the end the puzzler and his 

00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:54.090
 threats we all know that the joker died but 

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:56.400
 in the comic of the pre-history royal night we 

00:04:54.090 --> 00:04:58.800
 see it left a mark on batman 

00:04:56.400 --> 00:05:01.320
 are there similar elements of the plot 

00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:03.450
 i play the death of the joker at the end of arkham 

00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:05.730
 City strongly influenced Batman as much 

00:05:03.450 --> 00:05:07.920
 and the whole town house which is a joker 

00:05:05.730 --> 00:05:10.170
 instilled no longer exist as 

00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:13.050
 allowed the scarecrow to combine the forces of all 

00:05:10.170 --> 00:05:16.410
 supervillains and this is bad news for 

00:05:13.050 --> 00:05:18.900
 dark knight besides batmobile what else 

00:05:16.410 --> 00:05:21.230
 was the funniest and most difficult in the process 

00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:23.490
 development 

00:05:21.230 --> 00:05:24.000
 totally about building gotham city in 

00:05:23.490 --> 00:05:26.550
 details 

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:29.220
 probably this is the biggest creative and 

00:05:26.550 --> 00:05:31.250
 technical challenge for the studio to see then 

00:05:29.220 --> 00:05:34.560
 how we built gotham comes to life 

00:05:31.250 --> 00:05:36.660
 wonderful out of satisfying but 

00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:38.970
 I personally think that the function is dual play 

00:05:36.660 --> 00:05:43.680
 excellent team with catwoman 

00:05:38.970 --> 00:05:45.180
 bring down the enemies there is nothing better we know 

00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:47.280
 that the riddle is back in business 

00:05:45.180 --> 00:05:49.020
 we all want to see his trophies again 

00:05:47.280 --> 00:05:51.720
 how is it going 

00:05:49.020 --> 00:05:53.340
 if something sparkles in green and 

00:05:51.720 --> 00:05:55.370
 looks like ? 

00:05:53.340 --> 00:05:58.110
 then I guarantee it will be difficult 

00:05:55.370 --> 00:05:59.790
 the riddle is back and he challenges 

00:05:58.110 --> 00:06:01.890
 batman search never before 

00:05:59.790 --> 00:06:04.050
 inside the team we developed in 

00:06:01.890 --> 00:06:06.690
 the most difficult puzzles that could only 

00:06:04.050 --> 00:06:09.120
 come up but you are not going to fight alone 

00:06:06.690 --> 00:06:11.460
 Mysterious informers also returned 

00:06:09.120 --> 00:06:12.480
 but this time will not be so easy to knock out 

00:06:11.460 --> 00:06:15.129
 from them answers 

00:06:12.480 --> 00:06:17.559
 if you have any questions for us 

00:06:15.129 --> 00:06:20.289
 send the rock scene and we will answer them 

00:06:17.559 --> 00:06:24.089
 that's all for episode 7 archim insiders and 

00:06:20.289 --> 00:06:24.089
 don't forget be batman
