00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.659
 Hi there, this video on keddr.com 

00:00:01.829 --> 00:00:05.730
 we today we look at the capture card 

00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:07.890
 avermedia extreme computer 

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:09.090
 walk in appearance on the top 

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:11.610
 parts work light indicator 

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:13.019
 devices on the end there are only three connectors 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:15.960
 analog input for connection 

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:18.630
 playstation 3 hd may exit only 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:20.640
 yusbi 30 on it also gives in and food 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:21.720
 the main body is glossy and 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:23.369
 enough brand 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:25.410
 the lower part of the rubber to 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:27.359
 prevent slipping kit 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:29.820
 only analog input cord and 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:31.800
 beaten 30 most recently we did a review 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:33.600
 on avermedia live gamer portable 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:35.309
 so unlike him, this thing 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:36.239
 can record 60 frames per second 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:38.010
 full hd 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:39.570
 the truth is no longer autonomous to write on 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:42.149
 memory card and there is no possibility 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:43.800
 pass-through connection if for laptop 

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:45.210
 This is not a problem with a stationary 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:47.640
 computer difficulties may arise 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:49.710
 kind of rarely where of enough 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:51.390
 ports that connect both the monitor and the card 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:52.890
 capture simultaneously and sorts you 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:55.199
 need a driver and all for a long time 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:56.879
 familiar recipe roll utility if you want 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:58.859
 so much drive ponts that you can 

00:00:56.879 --> 00:00:59.399
 download plugins for sony vegas and a 

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:01.260
 premier 

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:03.090
 and in the latter you can run hard 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:04.559
 wear acceleration which involves 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:06.479
 architecture and nvidia cuda 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:08.400
 This thing is responsible for the transfer of complex 

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:10.470
 calculations central to graphic 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:12.510
 processor and it's not all streaming or 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:14.850
 You can write in the comments through any 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:16.560
 which supports directshow for example 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:18.600
 wheels and player besides avermedia 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:20.369
 the only company that sony gave 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:22.500
 the right to streaming 

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:24.150
 playstation 4 can be without any dancing with 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:25.890
 The tambourine also did not go away 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:27.900
 support for a variety of streaming 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:29.820
 of services the coolest is a capture card 

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:31.680
 This is what you can connect a DSLR and 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:33.450
 stream directly to youtube for example 

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:35.009
 all you need is an adapter 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:36.329
 hdmi we do not have dima 

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:38.280
 earlier there was not enough speed 

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:40.290
 data transfer is now the same connection 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:42.420
 coming through usb 30 don't forget that 

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:43.890
 to work correctly when recording at 60 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:45.899
 frames per second you will need 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:47.850
 Shustrik ssd-disk if live gamer 

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:49.799
 portable was designed specifically for 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:50.930
 gamer the extreme computer creates 

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:52.920
 more serious impression 

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:53.399
 professional video equipment 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:55.560
 production 

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:59.600
 Well, the cost has not changed much 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:59.600
 it's all the same plus minus 180 dollars
