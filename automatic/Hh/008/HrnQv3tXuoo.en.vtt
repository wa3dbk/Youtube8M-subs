00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:34.880 
is on the opposite of red on the color
wheel<00:00:33.989> if<00:00:34.230> you<00:00:34.290> guys<00:00:34.380> look<00:00:34.559> at<00:00:34.649> the<00:00:34.710> color

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:37.020 
wheel it's on the opposite side so if we

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:39.530 
wheel it's on the opposite side so if we

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:39.540 
have red skin and we use green to cancel

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:41.420 
have red skin and we use green to cancel
it<00:00:39.629> out<00:00:39.780> our<00:00:40.350> skin<00:00:40.680> will<00:00:40.800> be<00:00:40.890> almost<00:00:41.010> like<00:00:41.280> more

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:41.430 
it out our skin will be almost like more

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:43.369 
it out our skin will be almost like more
grayish<00:00:41.969> so<00:00:42.420> that<00:00:42.660> way<00:00:42.780> when<00:00:42.960> we<00:00:43.079> put<00:00:43.110> a

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379 
grayish so that way when we put a

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:47.360 
grayish so that way when we put a
foundation<00:00:43.620> on<00:00:44.219> it<00:00:44.879> will<00:00:45.090> stay<00:00:45.770> pretty<00:00:46.770> much<00:00:47.070> a

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.370 
foundation on it will stay pretty much a

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:49.340 
foundation on it will stay pretty much a
normal<00:00:48.030> foundation<00:00:48.239> color<00:00:48.840> instead<00:00:49.230> of

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
normal foundation color instead of

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:50.840 
normal foundation color instead of
seeing<00:00:49.620> all<00:00:49.710> these<00:00:49.829> colors<00:00:50.219> popping<00:00:50.460> through

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
seeing all these colors popping through

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:53.240 
seeing all these colors popping through
so<00:00:51.840> then<00:00:51.989> the<00:00:52.110> next<00:00:52.350> question<00:00:52.469> is<00:00:52.860> what's<00:00:53.160> the

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
so then the next question is what's the

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:54.229 
so then the next question is what's the
difference<00:00:53.340> between<00:00:53.579> concealing<00:00:54.120> and

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239 
difference between concealing and

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:56.600 
difference between concealing and
priming<00:00:54.600> for<00:00:54.719> me<00:00:55.440> I<00:00:55.710> really<00:00:56.219> don't<00:00:56.250> need<00:00:56.579> a

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610 
priming for me I really don't need a

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:59.029 
priming for me I really don't need a
green<00:00:57.030> primer<00:00:57.360> my<00:00:57.629> skin<00:00:57.989> is<00:00:58.140> not<00:00:58.379> super<00:00:58.890> super

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 
green primer my skin is not super super

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:01.369 
green primer my skin is not super super
red<00:00:59.399> right<00:00:59.609> now<00:00:59.640> I<00:01:00.180> have<00:01:00.510> a<00:01:00.539> couple<00:01:00.809> blemishes

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
here and in that case it's much better

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:05.780 
here and in that case it's much better
to<00:01:03.570> use<00:01:03.750> a<00:01:03.899> green<00:01:04.260> concealer<00:01:04.610> reason<00:01:05.610> why<00:01:05.729> is

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:05.790 
to use a green concealer reason why is

guys<00:01:19.680> have<00:01:20.280> a<00:01:20.310> sunburn<00:01:20.700> that's<00:01:21.630> when<00:01:21.930> you<00:01:22.049> need

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:22.290 
guys have a sunburn that's when you need

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:24.859 
guys have a sunburn that's when you need
a<00:01:22.350> green<00:01:22.740> primer<00:01:23.299> because<00:01:24.299> I<00:01:24.450> think<00:01:24.540> about<00:01:24.750> it

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
a green primer because I think about it

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:26.859 
a green primer because I think about it
primer<00:01:25.110> goes<00:01:25.350> over<00:01:25.530> the<00:01:25.619> entire<00:01:25.979> face

00:01:26.859 --> 00:01:26.869 
primer goes over the entire face

00:01:26.869 --> 00:01:28.910 
primer goes over the entire face
concealer<00:01:27.869> only<00:01:28.170> goes<00:01:28.320> on<00:01:28.500> these<00:01:28.680> little

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
concealer only goes on these little

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:31.010 
concealer only goes on these little
spots<00:01:29.280> so<00:01:30.240> those<00:01:30.390> are<00:01:30.540> the<00:01:30.600> two<00:01:30.810> main

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
spots so those are the two main

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:32.660 
spots so those are the two main
differences<00:01:31.320> but<00:01:31.650> the<00:01:31.799> basic<00:01:32.189> idea<00:01:32.460> is<00:01:32.520> to

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670 
differences but the basic idea is to

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:35.690 
differences but the basic idea is to
take<00:01:33.090> away<00:01:33.570> all<00:01:33.869> of<00:01:34.049> this<00:01:34.170> redness<00:01:34.680> next<00:01:35.490> what

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
take away all of this redness next what

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:37.399

do keep in mind the thickness of the
primer<00:01:44.460> this<00:01:45.060> primer<00:01:45.360> is<00:01:45.479> very<00:01:45.720> very<00:01:45.960> thin

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
primer this primer is very very thin

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:48.289 
primer this primer is very very thin
because<00:01:46.470> my<00:01:46.950> skin<00:01:47.220> is<00:01:47.280> not<00:01:47.520> super<00:01:47.820> super<00:01:47.970> red

because my skin is not super super red
now<00:01:48.840> I<00:01:49.110> believe<00:01:49.829> it's<00:01:50.100> by<00:01:50.310> like<00:01:50.850> philosophy<00:01:51.540> or

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:51.659 
now I believe it's by like philosophy or

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:54.980 
now I believe it's by like philosophy or
so<00:01:51.780> I<00:01:52.049> don't<00:01:52.350> know<00:01:52.409> who<00:01:52.530> it<00:01:52.649> is<00:01:52.799> by<00:01:53.070> um<00:01:53.899> might<00:01:54.899> be

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990 
so I don't know who it is by um might be

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:57.709

00:01:57.709 --> 00:01:57.719 
Lera Geller there's one but I think it's

00:01:57.719 --> 00:01:59.539 
Lera Geller there's one but I think it's
my<00:01:57.840> philosophy<00:01:57.990> but<00:01:58.469> it's<00:01:58.590> like<00:01:58.680> super<00:01:59.189> super

00:01:59.539 --> 00:01:59.549 
my philosophy but it's like super super

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:02.690

you need to go use this is probably

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:11.089 
you need to go use this is probably
better<00:02:09.750> just<00:02:10.050> because<00:02:10.259> it's<00:02:10.410> lighter<00:02:10.709> for

00:02:11.089 --> 00:02:11.099
