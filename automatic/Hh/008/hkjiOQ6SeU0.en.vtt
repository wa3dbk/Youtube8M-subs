00:00:05.550 --> 00:00:09.960
 these years i'm trying to do not know if i'm 21 years old jekyll island and concern 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:15.420
 between the universities of tunis hamdi hassan provence franco-german language 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:20.340
 I'm afraid in two words at the time of the announced in France so now I 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:23.360
 I arrived in germany so at the beginning we have complementarities with 

00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:25.200
 all French students 

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:28.940
 so it's pretty funny atmosphere to find in situations a little huh 

00:00:28.940 --> 00:00:32.439
 it was a bit crazy sometimes and art 

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:35.940
 and so we learned and not in the university system 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:39.030
 we hope we were really lost so we were in theaters and at 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:42.300
 the test asked us how was going to be spent all that and there were 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:45.870
 very shy beginnings very quickly we were very quickly integrated and it 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:49.150
 it was really nice ya as the races that was well 

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:52.810
 severe that German students they spent letters to that 

00:00:52.810 --> 00:00:55.850
 it was nice and what was good is also ea 

00:00:57.330 --> 00:01:01.130
 died in Aleppo for example because even if it's not at all like that 

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:04.440
 in France we have qualities for the year of its cakes and at the 

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:08.740
 teacher asks everyone to express themselves and to accra the wildlife ask 

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:10.869
 to catch up with staff 

00:01:10.869 --> 00:01:14.729
 before describing to describe a big folder on clear steam about the 

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:18.969
 course topic so that's really good and a possible in all 

00:01:18.969 --> 00:01:22.750
 projects to another the proposed film screenings we always had a 

00:01:22.749 --> 00:01:26.109
 english that coincides with afp what we like to do job talk 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:31.430
 there I participated in g translate I was in the same direction m there I 

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:35.310
 translated for a Franco-German festival of finuchem company to sign 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:36.060
 cast 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:40.000
 so this is a positive point and also insisted on Franco-German he has 

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.950
 simply to German student life who is a very nice very 

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:44.360
 international 

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:48.480
 for ruin for example in emmaÃ¼s we take bicycles every day to 

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:50.330
 comfortable but m 

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:53.850
 but musically by all together to make excursions in the south of the 

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:54.909
 France from Germany 

00:01:54.909 --> 00:01:56.350
