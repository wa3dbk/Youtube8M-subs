00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
just because hot and cold and make a

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:46.040 
just because hot and cold and make a

the<00:00:50.329> pattern<00:00:51.329> is<00:00:51.539> the<00:00:51.899> zebra<00:00:52.640> should<00:00:53.640> be<00:00:53.730> too

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910 
the pattern is the zebra should be too

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:55.130 
the pattern is the zebra should be too
hard<00:00:54.090> to<00:00:54.149> fine<00:00:54.360> there<00:00:54.539> we<00:00:54.600> go<00:00:54.690> haven't<00:00:54.989> used

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
hard to fine there we go haven't used

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:56.750 
hard to fine there we go haven't used
this<00:00:55.230> in<00:00:55.379> a<00:00:55.440> very<00:00:55.469> long<00:00:55.890> time<00:00:56.039> up<00:00:56.430> since<00:00:56.610> about

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
this in a very long time up since about

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:59.920 
this in a very long time up since about
episode<00:00:57.149> 7<00:00:57.539> the<00:00:58.260> color<00:00:58.500> was<00:00:58.829> orange<00:00:59.399> and<00:00:59.550> blue

00:00:59.920 --> 00:00:59.930 
episode 7 the color was orange and blue

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:02.660 
episode 7 the color was orange and blue
so<00:01:00.930> as<00:01:01.320> much<00:01:01.530> as<00:01:01.559> I<00:01:01.710> like<00:01:01.949> this<00:01:02.100> mask<00:01:02.340> I

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
so as much as I like this mask I

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:06.170 
so as much as I like this mask I
genuinely<00:01:03.239> could<00:01:03.809> not<00:01:04.080> think<00:01:05.010> of<00:01:05.250> a<00:01:05.729> name<00:01:06.119> for

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
genuinely could not think of a name for

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:11.060 
genuinely could not think of a name for
it<00:01:07.670> so<00:01:08.670> instead<00:01:09.380> we're<00:01:10.380> gonna<00:01:10.470> do<00:01:10.619> first<00:01:10.920> of

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
it so instead we're gonna do first of

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:14.090 
it so instead we're gonna do first of
all<00:01:11.189> a<00:01:11.400> new<00:01:11.850> material<00:01:12.420> the<00:01:12.720> cash<00:01:13.170> money<00:01:13.500> I've

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
all a new material the cash money I've

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:15.590 
all a new material the cash money I've
really<00:01:14.340> been<00:01:14.430> thinking<00:01:14.490> about<00:01:14.850> how<00:01:15.060> to<00:01:15.119> get<00:01:15.420> a

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
really been thinking about how to get a

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:17.390 
really been thinking about how to get a
you<00:01:15.930> set<00:01:16.200> of<00:01:16.320> that<00:01:16.439> as<00:01:16.560> well<00:01:16.740> such<00:01:17.100> a<00:01:17.159> cool

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400 
you set of that as well such a cool

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:21.980 
you set of that as well such a cool
looking<00:01:17.640> pan<00:01:18.680> and<00:01:19.680> then<00:01:19.799> finally<00:01:20.750> solid<00:01:21.750> red

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
looking pan and then finally solid red

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:24.140 
looking pan and then finally solid red
for<00:01:22.380> the<00:01:22.409> color<00:01:22.950> other<00:01:23.189> than<00:01:23.369> that<00:01:23.670> everything

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150 
for the color other than that everything

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:27.590 
for the color other than that everything
is<00:01:24.299> kept<00:01:24.570> the<00:01:24.689> exact<00:01:25.110> same<00:01:25.500> and<00:01:26.240> obviously<00:01:27.240> is

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
is kept the exact same and obviously is

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:29.929 
is kept the exact same and obviously is
bleeding<00:01:28.020> cash<00:01:28.259> so<00:01:28.680> it<00:01:29.250> almost<00:01:29.430> looks<00:01:29.759> like

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:29.939 
bleeding cash so it almost looks like

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:33.340 
bleeding cash so it almost looks like
this<00:01:30.210> guy<00:01:30.829> has<00:01:31.829> been<00:01:31.979> injured<00:01:32.369> but<00:01:32.610> underneath

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:33.350 
this guy has been injured but underneath

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:36.740 
this guy has been injured but underneath
it's<00:01:34.350> just<00:01:34.560> sort<00:01:34.740> of<00:01:34.770> dollar<00:01:35.009> bills<00:01:35.130> I<00:01:35.790> I<00:01:36.210> like

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750 
it's just sort of dollar bills I I like

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:39.230 
it's just sort of dollar bills I I like
the<00:01:36.900> idea<00:01:37.020> of<00:01:37.290> this<00:01:37.439> mask<00:01:37.740> I<00:01:38.460> might<00:01:39.000> try<00:01:39.180> and

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 
the idea of this mask I might try and

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:40.670 
the idea of this mask I might try and
think<00:01:39.329> of<00:01:39.420> a<00:01:39.570> slightly<00:01:39.900> better<00:01:40.110> name<00:01:40.409> for<00:01:40.439> the

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.680 
think of a slightly better name for the

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:45.410 
think of a slightly better name for the
actual<00:01:40.950> title<00:01:41.250> of<00:01:41.430> it<00:01:43.460> but<00:01:44.460> yeah<00:01:44.579> the<00:01:44.729> yolk<00:01:44.939> the

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420 
actual title of it but yeah the yolk the

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:46.999 
actual title of it but yeah the yolk the
cash<00:01:45.720> pattern<00:01:46.170> is<00:01:46.259> really<00:01:46.560> good<00:01:46.740> as<00:01:46.860> you
