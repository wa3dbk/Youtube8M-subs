00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:03.810 
about how to improve your hair growth

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:06.140 
about how to improve your hair growth
what's<00:00:04.799> most<00:00:05.009> important<00:00:05.549> with<00:00:05.700> hair<00:00:05.910> growth

00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:06.150 
what's most important with hair growth

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:07.430 
what's most important with hair growth
is<00:00:06.299> you<00:00:06.390> have<00:00:06.509> to<00:00:06.660> remember<00:00:06.839> the<00:00:07.080> health<00:00:07.259> of

00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:07.440 
is you have to remember the health of

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:09.860 
is you have to remember the health of
the<00:00:07.500> follicle<00:00:07.740> so<00:00:08.610> the<00:00:08.970> follicle<00:00:09.420> is<00:00:09.540> the<00:00:09.630> bulb

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:09.870 
the follicle so the follicle is the bulb

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:11.089 
the follicle so the follicle is the bulb
where<00:00:10.110> the<00:00:10.170> hair<00:00:10.320> actually<00:00:10.440> grows<00:00:10.650> out<00:00:11.070> of

00:00:11.089 --> 00:00:11.099 
where the hair actually grows out of

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:13.759 
where the hair actually grows out of
think<00:00:11.490> of<00:00:11.670> like<00:00:12.240> a<00:00:12.269> daffodil<00:00:12.809> and<00:00:12.990> if<00:00:13.620> that

00:00:13.759 --> 00:00:13.769 
think of like a daffodil and if that

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:15.860 
think of like a daffodil and if that
daffodil<00:00:14.370> isn't<00:00:14.639> fed<00:00:14.910> then<00:00:15.389> it's<00:00:15.570> not<00:00:15.690> going

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:15.870 
daffodil isn't fed then it's not going

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:18.500 
daffodil isn't fed then it's not going
to<00:00:15.929> bloom<00:00:16.109> so<00:00:16.830> once<00:00:17.279> you<00:00:17.609> feed<00:00:17.850> that<00:00:18.000> follicle

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:18.510 
to bloom so once you feed that follicle

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:20.870 
to bloom so once you feed that follicle
really<00:00:18.750> well<00:00:18.960> then<00:00:19.439> you<00:00:19.920> can<00:00:20.160> get<00:00:20.369> a<00:00:20.580> lot<00:00:20.760> of

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:20.880 
really well then you can get a lot of

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:22.720 
really well then you can get a lot of
hair<00:00:21.090> even<00:00:21.330> just<00:00:21.689> out<00:00:21.840> of<00:00:21.869> one<00:00:22.080> follicle

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:22.730 
hair even just out of one follicle

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:25.250 
hair even just out of one follicle
follicles<00:00:23.730> go<00:00:23.939> through<00:00:24.269> a<00:00:24.300> life<00:00:24.779> and<00:00:25.019> death

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:25.260 
follicles go through a life and death

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:28.460 
follicles go through a life and death
process<00:00:25.920> once<00:00:26.670> the<00:00:26.849> hair<00:00:27.029> grows<00:00:27.330> it<00:00:27.689> stays<00:00:28.260> in

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:28.470 
process once the hair grows it stays in

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:30.380 
process once the hair grows it stays in
that<00:00:28.590> growing<00:00:28.980> phase<00:00:29.250> for<00:00:29.580> about<00:00:29.789> six<00:00:30.150> months

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:30.390 
that growing phase for about six months

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:33.229 
that growing phase for about six months
to<00:00:30.689> a<00:00:30.720> year<00:00:30.810> and<00:00:31.199> then<00:00:32.009> once<00:00:32.850> it<00:00:33.059> goes<00:00:33.180> through

00:00:33.229 --> 00:00:33.239 
to a year and then once it goes through

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:35.420 
to a year and then once it goes through
a<00:00:33.450> stasis<00:00:33.930> phase<00:00:34.170> it<00:00:34.440> can<00:00:34.590> stay<00:00:34.800> in<00:00:34.829> that<00:00:35.100> phase

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:35.430 
a stasis phase it can stay in that phase

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:40.580 
a stasis phase it can stay in that phase
up<00:00:35.760> to<00:00:36.120> I<00:00:37.070> think<00:00:38.120> five<00:00:39.120> six<00:00:39.450> years<00:00:39.780> and<00:00:40.079> then

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:40.590 
up to I think five six years and then

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:42.139 
up to I think five six years and then
after<00:00:40.829> that<00:00:40.950> is<00:00:41.100> the<00:00:41.129> dying<00:00:41.489> phase<00:00:41.820> where<00:00:42.059> it

00:00:42.139 --> 00:00:42.149 
after that is the dying phase where it

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:43.850 
after that is the dying phase where it
actually<00:00:42.420> falls<00:00:42.660> out<00:00:42.930> and<00:00:43.140> that's<00:00:43.559> where<00:00:43.770> you

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:43.860 
actually falls out and that's where you

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:45.709 
actually falls out and that's where you
see<00:00:44.070> hair<00:00:44.340> all<00:00:44.489> over<00:00:44.520> the<00:00:44.789> floor<00:00:44.820> hair<00:00:45.480> on<00:00:45.600> your

00:00:45.709 --> 00:00:45.719

see hair all over the floor hair on your
clothes<00:00:46.020> that's<00:00:46.649> when<00:00:46.829> your<00:00:46.920> hair<00:00:47.070> falls<00:00:47.100> out

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:47.460 
clothes that's when your hair falls out

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:49.340 
clothes that's when your hair falls out
it's<00:00:47.730> normal<00:00:48.329> to<00:00:48.450> lose<00:00:48.600> about<00:00:48.840> a<00:00:48.960> hundred

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
it's normal to lose about a hundred

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:51.529 
it's normal to lose about a hundred
hairs<00:00:49.530> per<00:00:49.800> day<00:00:50.039> and<00:00:50.309> I<00:00:50.910> wouldn't<00:00:51.210> get<00:00:51.360> too
