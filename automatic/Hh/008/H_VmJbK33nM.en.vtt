00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
standing up so basically you have like

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:05.719 
standing up so basically you have like
zero<00:01:03.899> lag<00:01:04.170> between<00:01:04.439> crouching<00:01:05.040> and<00:01:05.189> not

zero lag between crouching and not
jumping<00:01:06.180> and<00:01:07.040> basically<00:01:08.040> because<00:01:08.340> of<00:01:08.490> that

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
jumping and basically because of that

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:09.770 
jumping and basically because of that

00:02:19.309 --> 00:02:19.319 
permanent who knows but but the point is

00:02:19.319 --> 00:02:25.309 
permanent who knows but but the point is

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:29.040 
to not get base reef but the point is

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:31.280

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:37.200 
pressing Crouch every like five seconds

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:38.449 
pressing Crouch every like five seconds
we<00:02:37.319> don't<00:02:37.470> know<00:02:37.560> that<00:02:37.590> is<00:02:37.830> considered<00:02:38.220> crowd

00:02:38.459 --> 00:02:42.650 
we don't know that is considered crowd
spam<00:02:39.560> likely<00:02:40.560> speaking<00:02:40.950> will<00:02:41.459> the<00:02:42.060> probably

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:42.660 
spam likely speaking will the probably

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:44.750

targeting<00:02:42.870> those<00:02:43.260> that<00:02:43.530> you<00:02:44.099> know<00:02:44.220> constantly

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:44.760 
targeting those that you know constantly

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:46.280 
targeting those that you know constantly
I'm<00:02:44.970> not<00:02:45.120> just<00:02:45.300> saying<00:02:45.420> like<00:02:45.630> really<00:02:46.200> really

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:46.290 
I'm not just saying like really really

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:49.280 
I'm not just saying like really really
fast<00:02:46.620> but<00:02:46.800> even<00:02:47.100> like<00:02:47.690> every<00:02:48.690> one<00:02:48.870> second<00:02:49.200> or

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:49.290 
fast but even like every one second or

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:51.289 
fast but even like every one second or
so<00:02:49.440> it<00:02:49.800> might<00:02:50.040> consider<00:02:50.400> that<00:02:50.640> as<00:02:50.850> crowd<00:02:51.060> spam

00:02:51.289 --> 00:02:51.299 
so it might consider that as crowd spam

00:02:51.299 --> 00:02:55.039 
so it might consider that as crowd spam
too<00:02:51.480> we'll<00:02:51.870> never<00:02:52.049> know<00:02:53.690> so<00:02:54.690> yeah<00:02:54.840> that's

00:02:55.039 --> 00:02:55.049 
too we'll never know so yeah that's

00:02:55.049 --> 00:02:59.360 
too we'll never know so yeah that's
pretty<00:02:55.170> much<00:02:55.440> it<00:02:55.650> for<00:02:55.950> this<00:02:56.269> I<00:02:57.380> find<00:02:58.380> this<00:02:58.560> is

00:02:59.360 --> 00:02:59.370 
pretty much it for this I find this is

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:01.280 
pretty much it for this I find this is
its<00:02:59.819> kind<00:03:00.120> of<00:03:00.269> avoiding<00:03:00.780> the<00:03:00.870> issue<00:03:00.989> they

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:01.290 
its kind of avoiding the issue they

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:06.170 
its kind of avoiding the issue they
should<00:03:04.190> they<00:03:05.190> are<00:03:05.370> avoiding<00:03:05.790> the<00:03:05.880> issue<00:03:06.000> on

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:06.180 
should they are avoiding the issue on

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:07.550 
should they are avoiding the issue on
this<00:03:06.420> they<00:03:06.630> should<00:03:06.810> have<00:03:06.900> just<00:03:07.110> added<00:03:07.319> an

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:07.560 
this they should have just added an

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:09.289 
this they should have just added an
animation<00:03:07.950> to<00:03:08.250> crouching<00:03:08.670> but<00:03:08.850> apparently

00:03:09.289 --> 00:03:09.299 
animation to crouching but apparently

00:03:09.299 --> 00:03:14.930 
animation to crouching but apparently
they<00:03:09.390> decided<00:03:09.780> not<00:03:09.900> to<00:03:09.989> do<00:03:10.080> that<00:03:13.459> so<00:03:14.459> yeah<00:03:14.640> so

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:14.940
