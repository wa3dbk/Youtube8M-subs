00:00:10.939 --> 00:00:12.419
 that of all 

00:00:12.419 --> 00:00:15.980
 this is the survey and the man is found for a small tutorial 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:20.110
 when we know that it's oral b father with cinema she said 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:22.109
 so first of all 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:24.390
 we are not exile 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:27.599
 so for Libyans the cover beforehand 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:30.599
 you know why the un 

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:33.560
 as for the cinematheque b 

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:36.340
 already we will do the adjustment of income 

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:39.350
 so here 

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:40.920
 the exit 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:42.390
 he deserves it 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:44.530
 nicolas hulot would be out by the oms 

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:45.680
 presets 

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:47.179
 a screen petition 

00:00:47.179 --> 00:00:50.340
 mika 141 900 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:53.650
 after when this system surprise them I find it just below 

00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:56.540
 this the beginnings of the tiff format 

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:59.280
 and psp so what is known and you put 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:00.430
 bmj 

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:04.089
 that's it for the path I put it in my site 

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:09.050
 dance i want to hold 

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:11.460
 at the end of the course 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:14.460
 when it will be known the pt giant led 

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:17.660
 and this since hindsight 

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:20.810
 so instead of just one modification of the law 

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:21.840
 after 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:23.039
 we can be modest 

00:01:23.039 --> 00:01:26.039
 so here is the text that appears 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:30.560
 cfoot was what you want emotional pop this crowd 

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:34.700
 in police 

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:36.950
 this country this country available 

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:39.950
 it proves that we still have 

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:43.100
 thinking kummer 

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:46.100
 after you can spot in the text 

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:48.000
 so now help 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.130
 you are going to need to have fun 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:51.100
 transit 

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:53.190
 it is available everywhere on the net 

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:55.460
 but that's not too hard 

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:58.460
 so first to open a form 

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:01.460
 the pot to the roses 

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:04.640
 a pyramid 

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:06.340
 never there 

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:08.729
 now in the plugin 

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:10.129
 cruzy 

00:02:10.129 --> 00:02:12.099
 but I'm happy for him 

00:02:12.099 --> 00:02:15.029
 so j where it is from the start it takes 

00:02:15.029 --> 00:02:16.569
 los angeles 7 

00:02:16.569 --> 00:02:18.499
 it's a cape this piece 

00:02:18.499 --> 00:02:20.389
 yes shame 

00:02:20.389 --> 00:02:21.809
 ap 

00:02:21.809 --> 00:02:24.670
 now love you can see that writings 

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:26.859
 according to him the subscript 

00:02:26.859 --> 00:02:30.429
 so jobs more like that you see your this part 

00:02:32.209 --> 00:02:34.279
 so now 

00:02:34.279 --> 00:02:36.679
 so now haired color 

00:02:36.679 --> 00:02:39.379
 woerth the first color 

00:02:39.379 --> 00:02:40.969
 he cuts 

00:02:40.969 --> 00:02:43.849
 a knee the hare by oddo 

00:02:43.849 --> 00:02:45.599
 in the program 

00:02:45.599 --> 00:02:47.599
 on the way so the color the red 

00:02:47.599 --> 00:02:49.709
 I put our section 

00:02:49.709 --> 00:02:51.919
 to have 

00:02:51.919 --> 00:02:54.879
 the texture I put the sole 

00:02:54.879 --> 00:02:57.449
 here 

00:02:57.449 --> 00:02:59.469
 we are going more and more 

00:02:59.469 --> 00:03:02.819
 and I leave specularity cochet the touching 

00:03:02.819 --> 00:03:05.339
 a child I am better too 

00:03:05.339 --> 00:03:08.509
 just cause i'm a friend 

00:03:08.509 --> 00:03:10.009
 so now 

00:03:10.009 --> 00:03:11.719
 we can separate 

00:03:11.719 --> 00:03:14.049
 the parts 

00:03:14.049 --> 00:03:17.539
 the first part 

00:03:17.539 --> 00:03:20.099
 he does not even 

00:03:20.099 --> 00:03:23.099
 all the winding crafts 

00:03:28.289 --> 00:03:31.289
 here 

00:03:32.559 --> 00:03:35.559
 I just want a little clue we're happy because 

00:03:36.629 --> 00:03:38.399
 time as a pro 

00:03:38.399 --> 00:03:41.399
 menchov actions of the td 

00:03:41.399 --> 00:03:43.969
 on it I find it right now 

00:03:43.969 --> 00:03:46.849
 after I do some more detailed stuff 

00:03:46.849 --> 00:03:50.429
 or then you put them a little bit, you'll scatter a lead around others 

00:03:50.429 --> 00:03:53.429
 no 

00:03:56.519 --> 00:03:58.939
 here 

00:03:58.939 --> 00:04:02.019
 so the red line besides what it gives the power 

00:04:03.989 --> 00:04:05.609
 we already knew 

00:04:05.609 --> 00:04:07.459
 thus I'll go 

00:04:07.459 --> 00:04:10.679
 the Tahitian lather colors 

00:04:10.679 --> 00:04:13.449
 yet young colors ground 

00:04:13.449 --> 00:04:16.449
 a rapist 

00:04:17.069 --> 00:04:19.579
 we did not rape her 

00:04:19.579 --> 00:04:22.059
 I have a lot of speculative 

00:04:22.059 --> 00:04:24.139
 ginette a glow too 

00:04:24.139 --> 00:04:25.529
 as reflection 

00:04:25.529 --> 00:04:28.749
 three weeks always meeting 

00:04:28.749 --> 00:04:30.710
 see 

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:33.620
 here 

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:36.749
 cycling 

00:04:36.749 --> 00:04:39.389
 to the third so that gives that for now 

00:04:39.389 --> 00:04:42.690
 so now for screaming the text color 

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:45.669
 more difficult 

00:04:45.669 --> 00:04:46.840
 here 

00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:49.120
 unilever keeps its record 

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:51.499
 so we take the color 

00:04:51.499 --> 00:04:54.749
 wanted to put a little yellow 1 622 

00:04:54.749 --> 00:04:57.749
 I appreciate 

00:04:58.779 --> 00:05:00.939
 so here I am not re-elected 

00:05:00.939 --> 00:05:03.669
 obstruction 

00:05:03.669 --> 00:05:06.969
 12% this time 

00:05:06.969 --> 00:05:10.139
 28 

00:05:10.139 --> 00:05:13.439
 judge a crazy at the forum have tested the Chinese who toasted all 

00:05:13.439 --> 00:05:15.770
 own and we see what it gives 

00:05:15.770 --> 00:05:18.409
 so me I 58 

00:05:18.409 --> 00:05:21.409
 I leave what they were and I go the wall we sell all alone 

00:05:22.479 --> 00:05:24.370
 one of them 

00:05:24.370 --> 00:05:27.370
 1 50% 

00:05:28.219 --> 00:05:29.830
 you take the material 

00:05:29.830 --> 00:05:32.189
 a series of indexes until the new text 

00:05:32.189 --> 00:05:33.789
 for China alone 

00:05:33.789 --> 00:05:36.039
 you can comment gina by college 

00:05:36.039 --> 00:05:39.039
 that's how the embedded matter 

00:05:40.069 --> 00:05:43.419
 so now to see what it gives 

00:05:43.419 --> 00:05:44.830
 So here is 

00:05:44.830 --> 00:05:46.029
 like that 

00:05:46.029 --> 00:05:47.360
 these stec 

00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:50.800
 so it's really a basic rate to create without the desktop wallpaper 

00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:54.240
 to create a wallpaper without parents we study 

00:05:54.240 --> 00:05:57.240
 so here is my aunt to take it off you click here 

00:06:00.520 --> 00:06:01.689
 so far 

00:06:01.689 --> 00:06:03.319
 for the times 

00:06:03.319 --> 00:06:06.619
 I wish 

00:06:06.619 --> 00:06:10.259
 when we love when it's over and it's one of those posters 

00:06:10.259 --> 00:06:12.569
 66 'the net 

00:06:12.569 --> 00:06:15.569
 so I have my mind this group is not giving itself 

00:06:16.689 --> 00:06:17.969
 so I find that 

00:06:17.969 --> 00:06:19.510
 therefore to define 

00:06:19.510 --> 00:06:22.460
 as pakistan 

00:06:22.460 --> 00:06:23.930
 and that's what it gives 

00:06:23.930 --> 00:06:26.279
 your current english 

00:06:26.279 --> 00:06:29.650
 the essarts for the big centers in a few minutes 

00:06:29.650 --> 00:06:33.009
 so here I also wanted to maxime 50 subscribers 

00:06:33.009 --> 00:06:37.050
 and I held I also wanted to panetiÃ¨re speeds he estimates so 

00:06:37.050 --> 00:06:37.979
 that they want 

00:06:37.979 --> 00:06:41.360
 so tight will you subscribe to his channel bbc box 

00:06:41.360 --> 00:06:42.330
 so I had 

00:06:42.330 --> 00:06:44.040
 it's a nice track to the next
