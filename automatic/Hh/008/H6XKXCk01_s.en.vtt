number is huge and the reason why

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:07.650 
percent is nobody knows how to really

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:10.190 
percent is nobody knows how to really
count<00:01:07.920> these<00:01:08.250> numbers<00:01:08.939> nobody's<00:01:09.330> reporting

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
count these numbers nobody's reporting

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:12.649 
count these numbers nobody's reporting
it<00:01:10.380> the<00:01:11.340> only<00:01:11.490> way<00:01:11.729> they<00:01:11.909> can<00:01:12.060> do<00:01:12.210> it<00:01:12.330> is<00:01:12.420> based

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:12.659 
it the only way they can do it is based

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:15.679 
it the only way they can do it is based
on<00:01:12.930> the<00:01:13.200> drugs<00:01:13.590> that<00:01:13.740> are<00:01:13.890> being<00:01:13.979> sold<00:01:14.460> and<00:01:14.909> so

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689 
on the drugs that are being sold and so

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:17.420 
on the drugs that are being sold and so
that<00:01:15.900> gives<00:01:16.170> all<00:01:16.650> kinds<00:01:17.040> of<00:01:17.100> spurious

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:17.430 
that gives all kinds of spurious

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:20.120 
that gives all kinds of spurious
information<00:01:18.360> so<00:01:18.900> I<00:01:18.930> suspect<00:01:19.619> the<00:01:19.710> numbers<00:01:20.009> are

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
information so I suspect the numbers are

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:21.859 
information so I suspect the numbers are
much<00:01:20.220> higher<00:01:20.520> because<00:01:21.360> there<00:01:21.509> are<00:01:21.570> people<00:01:21.689> who

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:21.869 
much higher because there are people who

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:24.620 
much higher because there are people who
are<00:01:22.049> choosing<00:01:22.229> not<00:01:22.439> to<00:01:22.860> treat<00:01:23.630> with

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
are choosing not to treat with

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:27.200 
are choosing not to treat with
medication<00:01:25.290> or<00:01:25.560> they're<00:01:26.520> not<00:01:26.670> being<00:01:26.850> reported

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210 
medication or they're not being reported

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:30.140 
medication or they're not being reported
in<00:01:27.570> the<00:01:27.659> same<00:01:27.840> way<00:01:28.110> I'm<00:01:29.009> finding<00:01:29.670> the<00:01:29.790> numbers

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.150 
in the same way I'm finding the numbers

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:32.929 
in the same way I'm finding the numbers
in<00:01:30.450> my<00:01:30.720> general<00:01:31.170> pediatric<00:01:31.740> practice<00:01:32.189> to<00:01:32.759> be

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:32.939 
in my general pediatric practice to be

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:35.179 
in my general pediatric practice to be
ridiculously<00:01:33.869> high<00:01:34.140> if<00:01:34.619> that<00:01:34.920> was<00:01:35.070> an

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:35.189 
ridiculously high if that was an

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:36.950 
ridiculously high if that was an
infectious<00:01:35.700> disease<00:01:35.729> it<00:01:36.659> would<00:01:36.810> be

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
infectious disease it would be

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:39.789 
infectious disease it would be
considered<00:01:37.380> an<00:01:37.500> epidemic<00:01:37.650> in<00:01:38.250> our<00:01:38.340> society

00:01:39.789 --> 00:01:39.799 
considered an epidemic in our society

considered an epidemic in our society
when<00:01:40.799> you<00:01:40.890> see<00:01:41.070> the<00:01:41.430> rise<00:01:41.700> like<00:01:42.270> we're<00:01:42.540> seeing

when you see the rise like we're seeing

in chronic disorders the cause is not a

in chronic disorders the cause is not a

ten<00:02:09.599> years<00:02:09.739> was<00:02:10.739> that<00:02:11.069> in<00:02:11.550> the<00:02:12.030> gut<00:02:12.300> there<00:02:13.020> are

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:13.140 
ten years was that in the gut there are

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:15.619 
ten years was that in the gut there are
serotonin<00:02:13.800> receptors<00:02:14.400> and<00:02:15.150> dopamine

00:02:15.619 --> 00:02:15.629 
serotonin receptors and dopamine

00:02:15.629 --> 00:02:18.260 
serotonin receptors and dopamine
receptors<00:02:16.349> these<00:02:17.129> are<00:02:17.280> chemicals<00:02:17.730> that<00:02:17.849> have

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:18.270 
receptors these are chemicals that have

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:22.130 
receptors these are chemicals that have
happened<00:02:18.989> to<00:02:19.050> exist<00:02:19.379> in<00:02:19.620> the<00:02:20.129> brain<00:02:20.780> and<00:02:21.780> we

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:22.140 
happened to exist in the brain and we

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:25.580 
happened to exist in the brain and we
realize<00:02:22.530> now<00:02:22.860> that<00:02:23.069> the<00:02:23.220> gut<00:02:23.489> is<00:02:23.910> a<00:02:24.000> brain<00:02:24.590> and

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:25.590 
realize now that the gut is a brain and

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:28.190 
realize now that the gut is a brain and
is<00:02:26.010> connected<00:02:26.310> directly<00:02:26.670> to<00:02:27.000> the<00:02:27.209> brain<00:02:27.450> so

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:28.200 
is connected directly to the brain so

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:30.110 
is connected directly to the brain so
much<00:02:28.230> so<00:02:28.680> that<00:02:28.980> they<00:02:29.190> now<00:02:29.370> have<00:02:29.640> a<00:02:29.670> field

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:30.120 
much so that they now have a field

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:32.589 
much so that they now have a field
that's<00:02:30.480> come<00:02:30.750> up<00:02:30.780> called<00:02:31.290> neuro

00:02:32.589 --> 00:02:32.599 
that's come up called neuro

00:02:32.599 --> 00:02:34.509 
that's come up called neuro
gastroenterology<00:02:33.599> which<00:02:33.810> is<00:02:33.989> a<00:02:34.019> field

00:02:34.509 --> 00:02:34.519 
gastroenterology which is a field

00:02:34.519 --> 00:02:36.979 
gastroenterology which is a field
literally<00:02:35.519> of<00:02:35.819> linking<00:02:36.330> the<00:02:36.360> brain<00:02:36.780> in<00:02:36.959> the

00:02:36.979 --> 00:02:36.989 
literally of linking the brain in the

00:02:36.989 --> 00:02:39.559 
literally of linking the brain in the
gut<00:02:37.290> so<00:02:37.620> when<00:02:38.040> you<00:02:38.129> ask<00:02:38.340> me<00:02:38.519> the<00:02:38.610> question<00:02:39.060> what

00:02:39.559 --> 00:02:39.569 
gut so when you ask me the question what

00:02:39.569 --> 00:02:42.480 
gut so when you ask me the question what
does<00:02:39.660> food<00:02:39.959> have<00:02:39.989> to<00:02:40.440> do<00:02:40.650> or<00:02:41.160> how<00:02:41.280> important<00:02:41.940> is

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:42.490 
does food have to do or how important is

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:44.610 
does food have to do or how important is

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:11.050 
seen in autism and I wouldn't believe

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:14.130 
seen in autism and I wouldn't believe
them<00:03:11.200> unless<00:03:11.500> I<00:03:11.680> saw<00:03:11.920> myself<00:03:12.390> were<00:03:13.390> related<00:03:14.020> to

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:14.140 
them unless I saw myself were related to

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:16.260 
them unless I saw myself were related to
just<00:03:14.380> simply<00:03:14.740> changing<00:03:15.190> diet<00:03:15.430> we<00:03:15.760> do<00:03:15.940> all

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:16.270 
just simply changing diet we do all

00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:18.630 
just simply changing diet we do all
kinds<00:03:16.300> of<00:03:16.690> fancy<00:03:17.140> stuff<00:03:17.200> with<00:03:18.010> kids<00:03:18.310> with

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:18.640 
kinds of fancy stuff with kids with

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:20.430 
kinds of fancy stuff with kids with
autism<00:03:18.670> and<00:03:19.420> I<00:03:19.570> must<00:03:19.840> say<00:03:20.020> the<00:03:20.200> thing<00:03:20.410> that

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:20.440 
autism and I must say the thing that

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:23.250 
autism and I must say the thing that
makes<00:03:20.980> the<00:03:21.250> most<00:03:21.460> difference<00:03:21.760> is<00:03:22.540> altering

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:23.260 
makes the most difference is altering

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:26.790 
makes the most difference is altering
the<00:03:23.920> food<00:03:24.130> that<00:03:24.340> they<00:03:24.490> eat<00:03:24.520> so<00:03:25.450> the<00:03:25.960> question

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:26.800 
the food that they eat so the question

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:30.060 
the food that they eat so the question
is<00:03:27.160> how<00:03:27.460> long<00:03:27.700> can<00:03:28.030> you<00:03:28.180> go<00:03:28.590> letting<00:03:29.590> the<00:03:29.830> kid

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:30.070 
is how long can you go letting the kid

00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:31.710 
is how long can you go letting the kid
go<00:03:30.280> on<00:03:30.430> strike<00:03:30.820> because<00:03:31.090> he<00:03:31.210> has<00:03:31.360> an<00:03:31.480> in<00:03:31.600> his

00:03:31.710 --> 00:03:31.720 
go on strike because he has an in his

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:34.560 
go on strike because he has an in his
chicken<00:03:32.080> nuggets<00:03:32.730> how<00:03:33.730> long<00:03:33.910> can<00:03:34.150> you<00:03:34.210> as<00:03:34.540> a

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:34.570 
chicken nuggets how long can you as a

00:03:34.570 --> 00:03:37.410 
chicken nuggets how long can you as a
parent<00:03:34.930> go<00:03:35.290> waiting<00:03:36.130> because<00:03:36.820> they<00:03:37.090> will<00:03:37.300> not

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:37.420 
parent go waiting because they will not

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:39.330 
parent go waiting because they will not
start<00:03:37.780> themselves<00:03:38.440> eventually<00:03:38.860> they'll<00:03:39.310> come

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:39.340 
start themselves eventually they'll come

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:39.990 
start themselves eventually they'll come
around

00:03:39.990 --> 00:03:40.000 
around

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.330 
around
it's<00:03:40.510> they<00:03:40.870> wear<00:03:41.110> you<00:03:41.350> down<00:03:41.590> because<00:03:41.890> you<00:03:42.100> feel

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:42.340 
it's they wear you down because you feel

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:44.910 
it's they wear you down because you feel
guilty<00:03:42.610> and<00:03:43.330> that's<00:03:43.840> the<00:03:44.080> problem<00:03:44.320> here<00:03:44.740> it's

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:44.920 
guilty and that's the problem here it's

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:46.590 
guilty and that's the problem here it's
not<00:03:45.070> about<00:03:45.280> the<00:03:45.430> kid<00:03:45.610> it's<00:03:45.940> about<00:03:46.090> the<00:03:46.240> parents

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:46.600 
not about the kid it's about the parents

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:49.380 
not about the kid it's about the parents
that's<00:03:47.530> not<00:03:47.740> just<00:03:48.010> what<00:03:48.310> you<00:03:48.490> need<00:03:48.730> it's<00:03:49.060> how

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:49.390 
that's not just what you need it's how

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:52.470 
that's not just what you need it's how
you<00:03:49.450> meet<00:03:49.780> and<00:03:49.990> where<00:03:50.980> you<00:03:51.220> eat<00:03:51.400> and<00:03:51.670> when<00:03:52.450> you

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:52.480 
you meet and where you eat and when you

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:54.990 
you meet and where you eat and when you
eat<00:03:52.810> it<00:03:53.560> was<00:03:53.680> a<00:03:53.710> study<00:03:54.250> that<00:03:54.310> just<00:03:54.460> came<00:03:54.820> out

00:03:54.990 --> 00:03:55.000 
eat it was a study that just came out

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:59.040 
eat it was a study that just came out
that<00:03:55.800> showed<00:03:56.800> that<00:03:57.030> having<00:03:58.030> kids<00:03:58.420> come<00:03:59.020> to

00:03:59.040 --> 00:03:59.050 
that showed that having kids come to

00:03:59.050 --> 00:04:03.200 
that showed that having kids come to
school<00:04:00.480> do<00:04:01.480> some<00:04:01.690> walking<00:04:01.900> exercises<00:04:02.890> and

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:03.210 
school do some walking exercises and

00:04:03.210 --> 00:04:08.040 
school do some walking exercises and
then<00:04:04.210> all<00:04:04.600> have<00:04:05.110> breakfast<00:04:05.680> and<00:04:05.980> then<00:04:06.990> go<00:04:07.990> to

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:08.050 
then all have breakfast and then go to

00:04:08.050 --> 00:04:11.540 
then all have breakfast and then go to
some<00:04:08.230> classes<00:04:09.120> and<00:04:10.120> then<00:04:10.300> have<00:04:10.600> recess<00:04:11.110> and

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:11.550 
some classes and then have recess and

00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:16.900 
some classes and then have recess and
then<00:04:12.550> have<00:04:12.850> lunch<00:04:13.200> raised<00:04:14.200> IQs

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:16.910 
then have lunch raised IQs

00:04:16.910 --> 00:04:19.509 
then have lunch raised IQs
I<00:04:17.200> think<00:04:18.200> one<00:04:18.350> of<00:04:18.380> the<00:04:18.530> greatest<00:04:18.800> ways<00:04:19.100> to<00:04:19.340> get

00:04:19.509 --> 00:04:19.519 
I think one of the greatest ways to get

00:04:19.519 --> 00:04:22.450 
I think one of the greatest ways to get
kids<00:04:19.700> to<00:04:19.850> eat<00:04:19.940> is<00:04:20.269> to<00:04:20.420> get<00:04:20.600> them<00:04:20.840> to<00:04:21.170> help<00:04:21.830> in

00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:22.460 
kids to eat is to get them to help in

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:25.510 
kids to eat is to get them to help in
the<00:04:22.610> process<00:04:23.060> of<00:04:23.180> cooking<00:04:23.860> there<00:04:24.860> or<00:04:25.040> growing

00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:25.520 
the process of cooking there or growing

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:27.280 
the process of cooking there or growing
the<00:04:25.640> food<00:04:25.820> so<00:04:26.540> there's<00:04:26.720> not<00:04:26.900> just<00:04:26.960> being

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:27.290 
the food so there's not just being

00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:29.520 
the food so there's not just being
shoved<00:04:27.650> at<00:04:27.890> them<00:04:28.130> like<00:04:28.340> they're<00:04:28.550> Lab<00:04:28.820> Rats<00:04:29.060> and

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:29.530 
shoved at them like they're Lab Rats and

00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:32.560 
shoved at them like they're Lab Rats and
then<00:04:30.530> you<00:04:30.920> may<00:04:31.070> see<00:04:31.400> them<00:04:31.670> eating<00:04:32.030> much

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:32.570 
then you may see them eating much

00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:35.800 
then you may see them eating much
healthier<00:04:33.100> having<00:04:34.100> kids<00:04:34.400> share<00:04:35.300> what<00:04:35.660> they're

00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:37.490 
eating with each other in a way of

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:40.780 
eating with each other in a way of
understanding<00:04:38.110> of<00:04:39.110> choices<00:04:39.680> might<00:04:40.400> be<00:04:40.550> good

00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:40.790 
understanding of choices might be good

00:04:40.790 --> 00:04:45.250 
understanding of choices might be good
and<00:04:41.060> maybe<00:04:41.750> eating<00:04:42.320> with<00:04:42.590> teachers<00:04:43.930> not<00:04:44.930> in

00:05:05.470 --> 00:05:05.480 
becomes difficult you know the question

00:05:05.480 --> 00:05:08.530 
becomes difficult you know the question
of<00:05:05.630> why<00:05:06.410> is<00:05:06.440> organic<00:05:07.160> food<00:05:07.370> better<00:05:08.090> for

shipped thousands and thousands of miles

00:05:14.650 --> 00:05:17.310 
shipped thousands and thousands of miles
we<00:05:15.650> know<00:05:15.920> that<00:05:16.220> there<00:05:16.430> is<00:05:16.550> a<00:05:16.580> beneficial

00:05:17.310 --> 00:05:17.320 
we know that there is a beneficial

00:05:17.320 --> 00:05:22.300 
we know that there is a beneficial
aspect<00:05:19.090> nutritionally<00:05:20.090> to<00:05:20.270> these<00:05:20.450> foods<00:05:21.410> it's

00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:22.310 
aspect nutritionally to these foods it's

00:05:22.310 --> 00:05:25.900 
aspect nutritionally to these foods it's
also<00:05:22.610> taste<00:05:23.600> better<00:05:23.920> so<00:05:24.920> the<00:05:25.070> quality<00:05:25.460> of<00:05:25.790> the

food children are like parakeets in the

00:05:28.880 --> 00:05:31.420 
food children are like parakeets in the
mind<00:05:29.150> to<00:05:29.570> me<00:05:29.720> and<00:05:29.960> so<00:05:30.410> they<00:05:30.590> pick<00:05:30.920> this<00:05:31.160> stuff

00:05:31.420 --> 00:05:31.430 
mind to me and so they pick this stuff

00:05:31.430 --> 00:05:34.060 
mind to me and so they pick this stuff
up<00:05:31.640> much<00:05:32.030> earlier<00:05:32.510> than<00:05:32.540> we<00:05:32.870> do<00:05:33.110> if<00:05:33.590> we<00:05:33.919> can
