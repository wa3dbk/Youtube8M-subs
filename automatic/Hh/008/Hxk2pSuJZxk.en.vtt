hey<00:00:02.190> I'm<00:00:02.639> gonna<00:00:03.030> geek<00:00:03.300> out<00:00:03.449> on<00:00:03.510> CUDA<00:00:04.259> and

00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:04.410 
hey I'm gonna geek out on CUDA and

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:09.440 
hey I'm gonna geek out on CUDA and
OpenCL<00:00:05.960> now<00:00:07.460> let's<00:00:08.460> be<00:00:08.790> clear<00:00:09.030> I'm<00:00:09.179> just<00:00:09.360> gonna

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:09.450 
OpenCL now let's be clear I'm just gonna

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:12.680 
OpenCL now let's be clear I'm just gonna
focus<00:00:09.719> on<00:00:10.019> the<00:00:10.309> graphics<00:00:11.309> cards<00:00:11.700> hardware

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:12.690 
focus on the graphics cards hardware

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:15.410 
focus on the graphics cards hardware
acceleration<00:00:13.230> of<00:00:14.219> programs<00:00:14.730> with<00:00:14.969> graphics

I<00:00:16.049> know<00:00:16.680> OpenCL<00:00:17.220> can<00:00:17.400> be<00:00:17.490> used<00:00:17.640> on<00:00:17.789> a<00:00:17.820> lot<00:00:18.000> of

00:00:18.019 --> 00:00:18.029 
I know OpenCL can be used on a lot of

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:20.750 
I know OpenCL can be used on a lot of
different<00:00:18.150> platforms<00:00:18.869> so<00:00:19.640> we're<00:00:20.640> gonna

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:20.760 
different platforms so we're gonna

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:23.810 
different platforms so we're gonna
ignore<00:00:21.029> all<00:00:21.270> the<00:00:21.390> other<00:00:21.420> ones<00:00:21.750> and<00:00:22.670> and<00:00:23.670> I<00:00:23.760> know

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:23.820 
ignore all the other ones and and I know

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:26.599 
ignore all the other ones and and I know
that<00:00:24.029> OpenCL<00:00:24.570> will<00:00:24.869> work<00:00:25.080> on<00:00:25.260> NVIDIA<00:00:25.560> but<00:00:26.519> if

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:26.609 
that OpenCL will work on NVIDIA but if

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:29.990 
that OpenCL will work on NVIDIA but if
you<00:00:26.670> do<00:00:26.789> a<00:00:26.820> Google<00:00:27.210> search<00:00:27.240> on<00:00:27.720> just<00:00:28.789> how<00:00:29.789> well

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:30.000 
you do a Google search on just how well

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.359 
you do a Google search on just how well
OpenCL<00:00:30.570> works<00:00:30.840> on<00:00:31.050> the<00:00:31.170> AMD<00:00:31.560> cards<00:00:31.949> versus

00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:32.369 
OpenCL works on the AMD cards versus

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:34.910 
OpenCL works on the AMD cards versus
Nvidia<00:00:32.850> it<00:00:33.719> works<00:00:33.960> so<00:00:34.140> much<00:00:34.290> better<00:00:34.559> on<00:00:34.649> the

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:34.920 
Nvidia it works so much better on the

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:38.630 
Nvidia it works so much better on the
AMD<00:00:35.070> that<00:00:35.870> I<00:00:36.870> think<00:00:37.110> you'd<00:00:37.230> be<00:00:37.350> silly<00:00:37.590> to<00:00:38.489> buy

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640 
AMD that I think you'd be silly to buy

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:43.369 
AMD that I think you'd be silly to buy
an<00:00:38.790> nvidia<00:00:39.210> card<00:00:39.540> to<00:00:39.690> do<00:00:39.809> OpenCL<00:00:42.079> so<00:00:43.079> it's

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379 
an nvidia card to do OpenCL so it's

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:47.150 
an nvidia card to do OpenCL so it's
gonna<00:00:43.500> be<00:00:43.649> cuda<00:00:44.040> on<00:00:44.250> nvidia<00:00:44.910> versus<00:00:45.829> open<00:00:46.829> CL

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160 
gonna be cuda on nvidia versus open CL

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:54.080 
gonna be cuda on nvidia versus open CL
on<00:00:47.370> AMD<00:00:48.230> now<00:00:52.280> AMD<00:00:53.280> they<00:00:53.640> haven't<00:00:53.879> really

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.090 
on AMD now AMD they haven't really

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:55.819 
on AMD now AMD they haven't really
invested<00:00:54.570> on<00:00:54.899> the<00:00:55.110> software<00:00:55.379> side<00:00:55.620> of<00:00:55.680> things

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
invested on the software side of things

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:58.869 
invested on the software side of things
as<00:00:56.219> much<00:00:56.430> into<00:00:56.699> open<00:00:56.969> CL<00:00:57.329> as<00:00:57.570> Nvidia<00:00:58.559> is

00:00:58.869 --> 00:00:58.879 
as much into open CL as Nvidia is

00:00:58.879 --> 00:01:02.750 
as much into open CL as Nvidia is
invested<00:00:59.879> in<00:01:00.000> CUDA<00:01:00.570> and<00:01:00.739> so<00:01:01.739> based<00:01:02.609> on<00:01:02.699> what

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
invested in CUDA and so based on what

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:05.210 
invested in CUDA and so based on what
I've<00:01:02.940> read<00:01:03.120> CUDA<00:01:03.510> is<00:01:03.600> more<00:01:03.809> mature<00:01:04.229> unless

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
I've read CUDA is more mature unless

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:06.320 
I've read CUDA is more mature unless
sure<00:01:05.369> exactly<00:01:05.580> what<00:01:05.850> that<00:01:05.939> means<00:01:06.119> I<00:01:06.270> don't

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
sure exactly what that means I don't

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:08.800 
sure exactly what that means I don't
really<00:01:06.659> I<00:01:07.020> haven't<00:01:07.830> done<00:01:07.920> this<00:01:08.070> stuff<00:01:08.310> myself

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:08.810 
really I haven't done this stuff myself

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:12.410 
really I haven't done this stuff myself
just<00:01:09.810> read<00:01:10.229> about<00:01:10.350> it<00:01:10.530> but<00:01:10.799> it<00:01:11.729> makes<00:01:12.150> it<00:01:12.299> sound

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
just read about it but it makes it sound

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:14.690 
just read about it but it makes it sound
like<00:01:12.540> it's<00:01:12.869> easier<00:01:13.439> to<00:01:13.560> do<00:01:13.710> on<00:01:13.740> CUDA<00:01:14.310> at<00:01:14.520> the

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
like it's easier to do on CUDA at the

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:18.080 
like it's easier to do on CUDA at the
moment<00:01:15.090> and<00:01:15.930> seems<00:01:16.200> like<00:01:16.380> a<00:01:16.409> lot<00:01:16.619> of<00:01:16.650> the<00:01:17.090> lot

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
moment and seems like a lot of the lot

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:21.289 
moment and seems like a lot of the lot
of<00:01:18.150> scientists<00:01:18.630> seem<00:01:18.810> to<00:01:18.990> be<00:01:20.000> when<00:01:21.000> they<00:01:21.090> want

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:21.299 
of scientists seem to be when they want

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:27.109 
of scientists seem to be when they want
to<00:01:21.390> do<00:01:21.509> like<00:01:23.090> fluid<00:01:24.090> dynamics<00:01:25.049> and<00:01:26.030> you<00:01:27.030> know

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:27.119 
to do like fluid dynamics and you know

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:27.920 
to do like fluid dynamics and you know
when<00:01:27.270> they<00:01:27.360> want<00:01:27.450> to<00:01:27.570> do<00:01:27.630> scientific

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
when they want to do scientific

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:30.890 
when they want to do scientific
calculations<00:01:28.799> and<00:01:29.130> they<00:01:29.250> want<00:01:29.460> to<00:01:29.900> speed

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:30.900 
calculations and they want to speed

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:32.660 
calculations and they want to speed
things<00:01:30.930> up<00:01:31.439> with<00:01:31.619> a<00:01:31.650> graphics<00:01:32.070> card<00:01:32.159> they<00:01:32.490> seem

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670 
things up with a graphics card they seem

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:35.950 
things up with a graphics card they seem
to<00:01:32.790> be<00:01:32.939> going<00:01:33.150> to<00:01:33.390> the<00:01:33.509> CUDA<00:01:33.869> on<00:01:34.049> Nvidia<00:01:34.680> cards

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:35.960 
to be going to the CUDA on Nvidia cards

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:40.850 
to be going to the CUDA on Nvidia cards
over<00:01:36.960> the<00:01:37.110> OpenCL<00:01:37.680> where's<00:01:38.460> OpenCL<00:01:39.030> AMD<00:01:39.860> seems

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860 
over the OpenCL where's OpenCL AMD seems

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:43.060 
over the OpenCL where's OpenCL AMD seems
to<00:01:41.009> be<00:01:41.130> just<00:01:41.340> kind<00:01:41.520> of<00:01:41.549> leaving<00:01:41.820> it<00:01:42.090> to

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:43.070 
to be just kind of leaving it to

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:46.550 
to be just kind of leaving it to
developers<00:01:44.070> to<00:01:44.549> do<00:01:44.759> the<00:01:44.939> legwork<00:01:45.119> of<00:01:45.630> software

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560 
developers to do the legwork of software

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:51.560 
developers to do the legwork of software
development<00:01:47.990> now<00:01:48.990> in<00:01:49.229> the<00:01:49.380> end<00:01:49.530> Nvidia<00:01:50.570> yeah

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:51.570 
development now in the end Nvidia yeah

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:53.600 
development now in the end Nvidia yeah
they<00:01:51.780> are<00:01:52.170> spending<00:01:52.439> money<00:01:52.740> on<00:01:52.890> developing

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:53.610 
they are spending money on developing

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:56.380 
they are spending money on developing
CUDA<00:01:54.060> and<00:01:54.479> making<00:01:55.020> it<00:01:55.140> more<00:01:55.290> mature<00:01:55.860> but

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:56.390 
CUDA and making it more mature but

00:01:56.390 --> 00:01:59.090 
CUDA and making it more mature but
they're<00:01:57.390> also<00:01:57.570> you<00:01:58.380> know<00:01:58.469> coming<00:01:58.710> out<00:01:58.920> with

00:01:59.090 --> 00:01:59.100 
they're also you know coming out with

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:01.429 
they're also you know coming out with
cards<00:01:59.430> like<00:01:59.579> Titan<00:02:00.540> the<00:02:00.780> custom<00:02:01.140> Posen

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:01.439 
cards like Titan the custom Posen

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:04.550 
cards like Titan the custom Posen
dollars<00:02:01.770> or<00:02:02.009> or<00:02:02.369> Titan<00:02:02.670> Z<00:02:02.939> that's<00:02:03.659> effectively

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:04.560 
dollars or or Titan Z that's effectively

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:07.670 
dollars or or Titan Z that's effectively
two<00:02:04.770> titans<00:02:05.189> on<00:02:05.430> one<00:02:05.640> card<00:02:05.969> but<00:02:06.060> 3,000<00:02:07.020> which

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:07.680 
two titans on one card but 3,000 which

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:12.170 
two titans on one card but 3,000 which
is<00:02:07.829> a<00:02:07.860> lot<00:02:09.800> but<00:02:10.800> maybe<00:02:11.250> that's<00:02:11.580> worth<00:02:11.760> it<00:02:11.970> for

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:12.180 
is a lot but maybe that's worth it for

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:14.240 
is a lot but maybe that's worth it for
someone

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:14.250 
someone

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:16.290 
someone
you<00:02:15.250> know<00:02:15.340> if<00:02:15.400> you<00:02:15.490> have<00:02:15.610> a<00:02:15.640> huge<00:02:15.910> scientific

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:16.300 
you know if you have a huge scientific

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:20.310 
you know if you have a huge scientific
budget<00:02:16.870> or<00:02:18.360> you're<00:02:19.360> used<00:02:19.540> to<00:02:19.690> spending<00:02:20.050> a<00:02:20.140> lot

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:20.320 
budget or you're used to spending a lot

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:23.420 
budget or you're used to spending a lot
of<00:02:20.350> money<00:02:20.730> renting<00:02:21.730> time<00:02:21.970> on<00:02:22.150> a<00:02:22.180> supercomputer

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:23.430 
of money renting time on a supercomputer

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:27.360 
of money renting time on a supercomputer
maybe<00:02:24.430> 3000<00:02:25.090> isn't<00:02:25.300> that<00:02:25.420> much<00:02:26.040> but<00:02:27.040> I<00:02:27.190> think

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:27.370 
maybe 3000 isn't that much but I think

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:29.060 
maybe 3000 isn't that much but I think
it's<00:02:27.460> a<00:02:27.550> lot<00:02:27.700> of<00:02:27.790> money<00:02:27.940> for<00:02:28.180> graphics<00:02:28.540> card

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:29.070 
it's a lot of money for graphics card

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:32.250 
it's a lot of money for graphics card
especially<00:02:30.070> where<00:02:30.300> in<00:02:31.300> the<00:02:31.420> future<00:02:31.780> it's<00:02:31.930> not

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:32.260 
especially where in the future it's not

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:37.760 
especially where in the future it's not
gonna<00:02:33.330> it's<00:02:34.330> gonna<00:02:34.420> be<00:02:34.600> updated<00:02:35.020> so<00:02:35.170> quickly

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:37.770 

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:41.280 

now<00:02:39.390> but<00:02:40.390> one<00:02:40.750> thing<00:02:40.930> that's<00:02:41.110> interesting

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:41.290 
now but one thing that's interesting

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:44.310 
now but one thing that's interesting
though<00:02:41.830> with<00:02:42.010> all<00:02:42.190> of<00:02:42.310> this<00:02:42.520> is<00:02:43.390> yep<00:02:43.690> Andy<00:02:44.170> of

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:44.320 
though with all of this is yep Andy of

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:47.940 
though with all of this is yep Andy of
course<00:02:44.620> has<00:02:44.800> it's<00:02:45.010> ap<00:02:45.370> use<00:02:45.810> and<00:02:46.810> maybe<00:02:47.680> I<00:02:47.770> just

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:47.950 
course has it's ap use and maybe I just

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:50.610 
course has it's ap use and maybe I just
stop<00:02:48.160> and<00:02:48.250> explain<00:02:48.340> cuz<00:02:49.050> you<00:02:50.050> know<00:02:50.170> one<00:02:50.440> of<00:02:50.470> the

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:50.620 
stop and explain cuz you know one of the

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:52.170 
stop and explain cuz you know one of the
problems<00:02:50.770> with<00:02:51.490> doing<00:02:51.520> hardware

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:52.180 
problems with doing hardware

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:54.330 
problems with doing hardware
acceleration<00:02:52.750> is<00:02:53.620> you<00:02:53.740> have<00:02:53.830> to<00:02:53.950> take<00:02:54.100> the

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:54.340 
acceleration is you have to take the

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:57.780 
acceleration is you have to take the
memory<00:02:54.670> from<00:02:55.480> the<00:02:55.630> CPU<00:02:56.050> memory<00:02:56.610> transfer<00:02:57.610> it

00:02:57.780 --> 00:02:57.790 
memory from the CPU memory transfer it

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:00.930 
memory from the CPU memory transfer it
to<00:02:58.200> GPU<00:02:59.200> memory<00:02:59.380> do<00:03:00.040> whatever<00:03:00.220> calculations

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:00.940 
to GPU memory do whatever calculations

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:02.400 
to GPU memory do whatever calculations
you're<00:03:01.120> going<00:03:01.240> to<00:03:01.300> do<00:03:01.450> and<00:03:01.720> then<00:03:01.810> transfer<00:03:02.260> the

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:02.410 
you're going to do and then transfer the

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:05.570 
you're going to do and then transfer the
results<00:03:02.530> back<00:03:03.150> and<00:03:04.150> that<00:03:04.270> transferred<00:03:04.720> time

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:05.580 
results back and that transferred time

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:10.050 
results back and that transferred time
can<00:03:06.780> can<00:03:07.780> reduce<00:03:08.620> the<00:03:08.860> overall<00:03:09.160> efficiency<00:03:09.520> of

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:10.060 
can can reduce the overall efficiency of

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:12.110 
can can reduce the overall efficiency of
a<00:03:10.210> whole<00:03:10.630> process

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:12.120 
a whole process

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:16.320 
a whole process
now<00:03:13.260> hopefully<00:03:14.260> you<00:03:14.670> your<00:03:15.670> calculation<00:03:16.210> is

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:16.330 
now hopefully you your calculation is

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:19.050 
now hopefully you your calculation is
large<00:03:16.570> enough<00:03:16.900> that<00:03:17.250> it's<00:03:18.250> worth<00:03:18.459> it<00:03:18.670> to<00:03:18.820> send

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:19.060 
large enough that it's worth it to send

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:23.370 
large enough that it's worth it to send
it<00:03:19.209> to<00:03:19.840> GPU<00:03:20.770> which<00:03:21.370> is<00:03:21.580> you<00:03:22.300> know<00:03:22.390> care<00:03:22.690> capable

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:23.380 
it to GPU which is you know care capable

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:27.240 
it to GPU which is you know care capable
of<00:03:23.500> a<00:03:23.530> lot<00:03:23.680> more<00:03:23.800> parallel<00:03:24.400> processing<00:03:25.090> I<00:03:26.250> mean

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:27.250 
of a lot more parallel processing I mean

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:29.400 
of a lot more parallel processing I mean
he'll<00:03:27.370> the<00:03:27.520> Titan<00:03:27.850> has<00:03:28.030> how<00:03:28.600> many<00:03:28.660> thousands

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:29.410 
he'll the Titan has how many thousands

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:32.670 
he'll the Titan has how many thousands
of<00:03:29.500> CUDA<00:03:29.739> cores<00:03:29.950> I<00:03:30.340> mean<00:03:30.959> maybe<00:03:31.959> it's<00:03:32.050> 3000

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:32.680 
of CUDA cores I mean maybe it's 3000

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:36.780 
of CUDA cores I mean maybe it's 3000
CUDA<00:03:32.890> cores<00:03:33.040> something<00:03:33.430> like<00:03:33.580> that<00:03:35.790> whereas

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:36.790 
CUDA cores something like that whereas

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:41.729 
CUDA cores something like that whereas
you<00:03:37.420> know<00:03:37.480> a<00:03:37.540> CPU<00:03:38.050> is<00:03:38.230> just<00:03:38.470> a<00:03:38.560> few<00:03:38.739> cores<00:03:40.739> lot

00:03:41.729 --> 00:03:41.739 
you know a CPU is just a few cores lot

00:03:41.739 --> 00:03:46.740 
you know a CPU is just a few cores lot
more<00:03:41.920> latency<00:03:42.850> but<00:03:44.070> in<00:03:45.070> any<00:03:45.670> cases<00:03:46.300> if<00:03:46.600> you're

00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:46.750 
more latency but in any cases if you're

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:48.870 
more latency but in any cases if you're
doing<00:03:46.870> a<00:03:46.989> lot<00:03:47.110> of<00:03:47.140> parallel<00:03:48.100> processing<00:03:48.280> it's

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:48.880 
doing a lot of parallel processing it's

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:50.460 
doing a lot of parallel processing it's
worth<00:03:49.030> it<00:03:49.239> to<00:03:49.360> send<00:03:49.570> it<00:03:49.690> to<00:03:49.720> a<00:03:49.810> graphics<00:03:50.230> card

00:03:50.460 --> 00:03:50.470 
worth it to send it to a graphics card

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:52.890 
worth it to send it to a graphics card
do<00:03:50.890> it<00:03:51.040> there<00:03:51.280> but<00:03:52.060> there's<00:03:52.330> the<00:03:52.480> transfer

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:52.900 
do it there but there's the transfer

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:55.199 
do it there but there's the transfer
time<00:03:53.590> it<00:03:53.860> takes<00:03:54.040> to<00:03:54.160> transfer<00:03:54.550> the<00:03:54.670> data<00:03:54.790> there

00:03:55.199 --> 00:03:55.209 
time it takes to transfer the data there

00:03:55.209 --> 00:03:57.600 
time it takes to transfer the data there
and<00:03:55.390> then<00:03:55.510> transfer<00:03:55.870> it<00:03:55.989> back<00:03:56.459> but<00:03:57.459> that's

00:03:57.600 --> 00:03:57.610 
and then transfer it back but that's

00:03:57.610 --> 00:04:00.390 
and then transfer it back but that's
where<00:03:57.760> ap<00:03:58.180> use<00:03:58.300> come<00:03:58.660> in<00:03:58.840> like<00:03:59.590> indeed<00:04:00.190> they've

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:00.400 
where ap use come in like indeed they've

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:02.699 
where ap use come in like indeed they've
got<00:04:00.550> their<00:04:00.670> APU<00:04:01.060> where<00:04:01.390> if<00:04:01.480> both<00:04:01.810> the<00:04:01.959> CPU<00:04:02.140> and

00:04:02.699 --> 00:04:02.709 
got their APU where if both the CPU and

00:04:02.709 --> 00:04:05.970 
got their APU where if both the CPU and
the<00:04:02.769> graphics<00:04:03.670> card<00:04:03.970> all<00:04:04.239> on<00:04:04.480> one<00:04:04.660> chip<00:04:05.050> and<00:04:05.320> it

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:05.980 
the graphics card all on one chip and it

00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:10.259 
the graphics card all on one chip and it
uses<00:04:06.160> the<00:04:06.430> same<00:04:06.670> pool<00:04:07.150> of<00:04:07.180> memory<00:04:08.910> so<00:04:09.910> you

00:04:10.259 --> 00:04:10.269 
uses the same pool of memory so you

00:04:10.269 --> 00:04:13.560 
uses the same pool of memory so you
don't<00:04:10.510> have<00:04:10.630> to<00:04:10.780> transfer<00:04:11.019> the<00:04:11.470> data<00:04:12.420> from<00:04:13.420> one

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:13.570 
don't have to transfer the data from one

00:04:13.570 --> 00:04:16.020 
don't have to transfer the data from one
pool<00:04:13.780> of<00:04:13.900> memory<00:04:14.080> to<00:04:14.410> another<00:04:14.709> it<00:04:15.310> just<00:04:15.760> has<00:04:15.910> to

00:04:16.020 --> 00:04:16.030 
pool of memory to another it just has to

00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:17.000 
pool of memory to another it just has to
know<00:04:16.090> where<00:04:16.419> to<00:04:16.450> look

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:17.010 
know where to look

00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:21.320 
know where to look
yeah<00:04:18.010> where<00:04:18.400> to<00:04:18.519> point<00:04:18.700> it<00:04:19.090> and<00:04:19.690> so<00:04:20.230> uh

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:21.330 
yeah where to point it and so uh

00:04:21.330 --> 00:04:23.640 
yeah where to point it and so uh
the<00:04:22.330> only<00:04:22.570> problem<00:04:22.900> is<00:04:22.990> so<00:04:23.170> at<00:04:23.320> the<00:04:23.470> moment

00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:23.650 
the only problem is so at the moment

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:25.920 
the only problem is so at the moment
those<00:04:24.070> ap<00:04:24.460> use<00:04:24.550> they're<00:04:25.030> not<00:04:25.180> they're<00:04:25.900> not

00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:25.930 
those ap use they're not they're not

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:28.760 
those ap use they're not they're not
that<00:04:26.230> powerful

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:28.770 

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:31.740

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:31.750 
like I mean an AMD APU is nothing

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:34.500

to<00:04:37.900> transfer<00:04:38.230> memory<00:04:38.770> matters<00:04:39.550> so<00:04:40.330> I<00:04:40.360> think

00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:40.480 
to transfer memory matters so I think

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:42.990 
to transfer memory matters so I think
that<00:04:40.840> could<00:04:41.110> be<00:04:41.560> a<00:04:41.980> game-changer<00:04:42.250> in<00:04:42.880> the

00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:43.000 
that could be a game-changer in the

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:47.280 
that could be a game-changer in the
future<00:04:43.390> if<00:04:45.030> if<00:04:46.030> AMD<00:04:46.480> were<00:04:46.750> to<00:04:46.870> come<00:04:47.020> out<00:04:47.110> with<00:04:47.260> a

00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:47.290 
future if if AMD were to come out with a

00:04:47.290 --> 00:04:49.200 
future if if AMD were to come out with a
really<00:04:47.560> powerful<00:04:47.800> apu<00:04:48.520> with<00:04:48.850> a<00:04:48.880> really

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:49.210 
really powerful apu with a really

00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:53.010 
really powerful apu with a really
powerful<00:04:49.360> graphics<00:04:50.130> card<00:04:51.130> on<00:04:51.310> die<00:04:51.790> and<00:04:52.720> in

00:04:53.010 --> 00:04:53.020 
powerful graphics card on die and in

00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:56.370 
powerful graphics card on die and in
with<00:04:53.560> the<00:04:53.830> ddr4<00:04:54.640> the<00:04:55.510> memory<00:04:55.840> speeds<00:04:56.170> are

00:04:56.370 --> 00:04:56.380 
with the ddr4 the memory speeds are

00:04:56.380 --> 00:04:59.520 
with the ddr4 the memory speeds are
gonna<00:04:56.500> go<00:04:56.740> up<00:04:57.900> I'm<00:04:58.900> not<00:04:59.080> sure<00:04:59.200> if<00:04:59.290> they<00:04:59.410> can

00:04:59.520 --> 00:04:59.530 
gonna go up I'm not sure if they can

00:04:59.530 --> 00:05:01.470 
gonna go up I'm not sure if they can
keep<00:04:59.650> the<00:04:59.800> latency<00:05:00.280> up<00:05:00.430> as<00:05:00.640> well<00:05:00.850> they<00:05:01.330> might

00:05:01.470 --> 00:05:01.480 
keep the latency up as well they might

00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:03.330 
keep the latency up as well they might
have<00:05:01.540> to<00:05:01.720> sacrifice<00:05:01.900> one<00:05:02.470> for<00:05:02.500> the<00:05:02.740> other<00:05:02.830> but

00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:03.340 
have to sacrifice one for the other but

00:05:03.340 --> 00:05:06.540 
have to sacrifice one for the other but
you<00:05:03.750> know<00:05:04.750> you've<00:05:04.870> got<00:05:05.050> really<00:05:05.950> high<00:05:06.130> fast

00:05:06.540 --> 00:05:06.550 
you know you've got really high fast

00:05:06.550 --> 00:05:12.480 
you know you've got really high fast
ddr4<00:05:07.450> Ram<00:05:07.780> and<00:05:08.290> all<00:05:09.330> an<00:05:10.330> APU<00:05:10.960> with<00:05:11.380> again<00:05:11.860> CPU

00:05:12.480 --> 00:05:12.490 
ddr4 Ram and all an APU with again CPU

00:05:12.490 --> 00:05:16.590 
ddr4 Ram and all an APU with again CPU
GPU<00:05:12.790> on<00:05:13.150> the<00:05:13.240> same<00:05:13.480> die<00:05:15.090> that<00:05:16.090> could<00:05:16.240> be<00:05:16.330> really

00:05:16.590 --> 00:05:16.600 
GPU on the same die that could be really

00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:22.560 
GPU on the same die that could be really
good<00:05:16.750> with<00:05:17.230> OpenCL<00:05:20.130> now<00:05:21.130> Nvidia<00:05:21.610> they<00:05:22.330> kind<00:05:22.540> of

00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:22.570 
good with OpenCL now Nvidia they kind of

00:05:22.570 --> 00:05:25.620 
good with OpenCL now Nvidia they kind of
 with<00:05:23.050> their<00:05:23.169> marketing<00:05:23.620> cuz<00:05:24.630> they

00:05:25.620 --> 00:05:25.630 
 with their marketing cuz they

00:05:25.630 --> 00:05:27.470 
 with their marketing cuz they
make<00:05:26.020> it<00:05:26.110> sound<00:05:26.290> like<00:05:26.530> they're<00:05:26.770> gonna<00:05:26.890> somehow

00:05:27.470 --> 00:05:27.480 
make it sound like they're gonna somehow

00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:31.080 
make it sound like they're gonna somehow
do<00:05:28.480> the<00:05:28.660> equivalent<00:05:29.260> of<00:05:29.380> that<00:05:29.590> and<00:05:30.040> they<00:05:30.820> sort

00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:31.090 
do the equivalent of that and they sort

00:05:31.090 --> 00:05:32.610 
do the equivalent of that and they sort
of<00:05:31.210> are<00:05:31.419> but<00:05:31.720> they're<00:05:32.020> really<00:05:32.169> just<00:05:32.410> gonna

00:05:32.610 --> 00:05:32.620 
of are but they're really just gonna

00:05:32.620 --> 00:05:36.719 
of are but they're really just gonna
speed<00:05:33.010> up<00:05:33.040> the<00:05:33.550> transfer<00:05:34.230> from<00:05:35.250> from<00:05:36.250> the<00:05:36.370> CPU

00:05:36.719 --> 00:05:36.729 
speed up the transfer from from the CPU

00:05:36.729 --> 00:05:40.580 
speed up the transfer from from the CPU
memory<00:05:36.910> to<00:05:37.390> GPU<00:05:37.810> memory<00:05:38.050> I<00:05:38.790> think<00:05:39.790> they<00:05:40.060> call<00:05:40.240> a

00:05:40.580 --> 00:05:40.590 
memory to GPU memory I think they call a

00:05:40.590 --> 00:05:43.560 
memory to GPU memory I think they call a
unified<00:05:41.590> memory<00:05:41.940> interface<00:05:42.940> or<00:05:43.180> I<00:05:43.330> don't<00:05:43.390> know

00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:43.570 
unified memory interface or I don't know

00:05:43.570 --> 00:05:44.909 
unified memory interface or I don't know
they<00:05:43.750> got<00:05:43.870> some<00:05:44.380> name<00:05:44.530> for<00:05:44.770> it<00:05:44.830> but

00:05:44.909 --> 00:05:44.919 
they got some name for it but

00:05:44.919 --> 00:05:46.560 
they got some name for it but
it's<00:05:45.100> not<00:05:45.220> it's<00:05:45.640> not<00:05:45.700> really<00:05:45.940> unified<00:05:46.330> memory

00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:46.570 
it's not it's not really unified memory

00:05:46.570 --> 00:05:49.400 
it's not it's not really unified memory
it's<00:05:46.900> just<00:05:47.340> again<00:05:48.340> an<00:05:48.460> increase<00:05:48.640> in<00:05:49.030> the<00:05:49.150> speed

00:05:49.400 --> 00:05:49.410 
it's just again an increase in the speed

00:05:49.410 --> 00:05:53.550 
it's just again an increase in the speed
memory<00:05:50.410> transfer<00:05:50.890> speed<00:05:52.140> problem<00:05:53.140> I<00:05:53.410> don't

00:05:53.550 --> 00:05:53.560 
memory transfer speed problem I don't

00:05:53.560 --> 00:05:54.719 
memory transfer speed problem I don't
know<00:05:53.710> if<00:05:53.770> that's<00:05:53.919> the<00:05:54.040> official<00:05:54.100> word<00:05:54.460> but<00:05:54.640> the

00:05:54.719 --> 00:05:54.729 
know if that's the official word but the

00:05:54.729 --> 00:05:56.520 
know if that's the official word but the
point<00:05:54.910> is<00:05:55.030> just<00:05:55.060> the<00:05:55.390> speed<00:05:55.840> that<00:05:56.290> they<00:05:56.410> can

00:05:56.520 --> 00:05:56.530 
point is just the speed that they can

00:05:56.530 --> 00:05:59.520 
point is just the speed that they can
transfer<00:05:56.919> data<00:05:57.180> from<00:05:58.180> CPU<00:05:58.540> memory<00:05:58.720> to<00:05:59.169> GPU

00:05:59.520 --> 00:05:59.530 
transfer data from CPU memory to GPU

00:05:59.530 --> 00:06:09.120 
transfer data from CPU memory to GPU
memory<00:06:04.080> and<00:06:05.080> hey<00:06:05.470> maybe<00:06:06.840> PCI<00:06:07.840> 4<00:06:08.620> will<00:06:08.979> come

00:06:09.120 --> 00:06:09.130 
memory and hey maybe PCI 4 will come

00:06:09.130 --> 00:06:11.490 
memory and hey maybe PCI 4 will come
along<00:06:09.370> and<00:06:09.430> it'll<00:06:09.790> change<00:06:10.780> everything<00:06:11.020> there

00:06:11.490 --> 00:06:11.500 
along and it'll change everything there

00:06:11.500 --> 00:06:14.130 
along and it'll change everything there
and<00:06:11.800> that<00:06:12.729> won't<00:06:12.880> be<00:06:13.150> as<00:06:13.270> much<00:06:13.450> of<00:06:13.510> an<00:06:13.690> issue<00:06:13.810> if

00:06:14.130 --> 00:06:14.140 
and that won't be as much of an issue if

00:06:14.140 --> 00:06:16.920 
and that won't be as much of an issue if
they<00:06:14.290> can<00:06:14.440> really<00:06:14.680> increase<00:06:15.930> bandwidth

00:06:16.920 --> 00:06:16.930 
they can really increase bandwidth

00:06:16.930 --> 00:06:20.130 
they can really increase bandwidth
between<00:06:17.440> the<00:06:18.540> motherboard<00:06:19.540> and<00:06:19.660> the<00:06:19.750> graphics

00:06:20.130 --> 00:06:20.140 
between the motherboard and the graphics

00:06:20.140 --> 00:06:27.220 
between the motherboard and the graphics
card

00:06:27.220 --> 00:06:27.230 

00:06:27.230 --> 00:06:29.690 

yeah

00:06:29.690 --> 00:06:29.700 
yeah

00:06:29.700 --> 00:06:32.390 
yeah
so<00:06:30.270> I<00:06:30.510> think<00:06:30.810> it's<00:06:30.930> all<00:06:31.080> pretty<00:06:31.290> cool<00:06:31.560> though

00:06:32.390 --> 00:06:32.400 
so I think it's all pretty cool though

00:06:32.400 --> 00:06:38.600 
so I think it's all pretty cool though
pretty<00:06:32.940> interesting<00:06:36.200> B<00:06:37.200> I'm<00:06:38.070> guessing<00:06:38.460> it's

00:06:38.600 --> 00:06:38.610 
pretty interesting B I'm guessing it's

00:06:38.610 --> 00:06:43.550 
pretty interesting B I'm guessing it's
fairly<00:06:38.850> difficult<00:06:39.090> to<00:06:39.420> program<00:06:39.750> for<00:06:41.270> but<00:06:42.560> well

00:06:43.550 --> 00:06:43.560 
fairly difficult to program for but well

00:06:43.560 --> 00:06:45.020 
fairly difficult to program for but well
be<00:06:43.830> interesting<00:06:44.250> to<00:06:44.340> see<00:06:44.430> what<00:06:44.610> happens<00:06:44.880> the

00:06:45.020 --> 00:06:45.030 
be interesting to see what happens the

00:06:45.030 --> 00:06:49.250 
be interesting to see what happens the
next<00:06:45.180> couple<00:06:45.570> of<00:06:45.630> years<00:06:46.340> and<00:06:48.050> it's<00:06:49.050> probably

00:06:49.250 --> 00:06:49.260 
next couple of years and it's probably

00:06:49.260 --> 00:06:51.110 
next couple of years and it's probably
just<00:06:49.500> gonna<00:06:49.710> become<00:06:49.860> even<00:06:50.280> more<00:06:50.310> popular<00:06:50.970> with

00:06:51.110 --> 00:06:51.120 
just gonna become even more popular with

00:06:51.120 --> 00:06:54.560 
just gonna become even more popular with
time<00:06:51.420> because<00:06:52.460> GPU<00:06:53.460> prices<00:06:53.940> of<00:06:54.060> course<00:06:54.300> go

00:06:54.560 --> 00:06:54.570 
time because GPU prices of course go

00:06:54.570 --> 00:06:56.570 
time because GPU prices of course go
down<00:06:54.780> and<00:06:55.200> something<00:06:55.560> new<00:06:55.800> that's<00:06:56.190> even<00:06:56.550> more

00:06:56.570 --> 00:06:56.580 
down and something new that's even more

00:06:56.580 --> 00:07:00.380 
down and something new that's even more
powerful<00:06:56.730> comes<00:06:57.390> along<00:06:57.750> so<00:06:58.710> it<00:06:58.830> becomes<00:06:59.390> more

00:07:00.380 --> 00:07:00.390 
powerful comes along so it becomes more

00:07:00.390 --> 00:07:02.090 
powerful comes along so it becomes more
and<00:07:00.510> more<00:07:00.600> cost<00:07:00.930> effective<00:07:01.440> for<00:07:01.680> people<00:07:01.800> to

00:07:02.090 --> 00:07:02.100 
and more cost effective for people to

00:07:02.100 --> 00:07:05.650 
and more cost effective for people to
just<00:07:02.460> buy<00:07:02.790> a<00:07:02.820> graphics<00:07:03.300> card<00:07:03.390> I<00:07:04.310> mean<00:07:05.310> today's

00:07:05.650 --> 00:07:05.660 
just buy a graphics card I mean today's

00:07:05.660 --> 00:07:09.140 
just buy a graphics card I mean today's
you<00:07:06.660> know<00:07:06.750> $800<00:07:07.350> graphics<00:07:07.770> card<00:07:08.010> will<00:07:08.190> be<00:07:08.310> $400

00:07:09.140 --> 00:07:09.150 
you know $800 graphics card will be $400

00:07:09.150 --> 00:07:11.780 
you know $800 graphics card will be $400
in<00:07:09.360> a<00:07:09.420> couple<00:07:09.720> of<00:07:09.780> years<00:07:09.960> or<00:07:10.320> so<00:07:10.550> or<00:07:11.550> even

00:07:11.780 --> 00:07:11.790 
in a couple of years or so or even

00:07:11.790 --> 00:07:15.500 
in a couple of years or so or even
through<00:07:12.030> two<00:07:12.360> or<00:07:12.510> three<00:07:12.750> hundred<00:07:13.280> and<00:07:14.280> so<00:07:14.850> yeah

00:07:15.500 --> 00:07:15.510 
through two or three hundred and so yeah

00:07:15.510 --> 00:07:17.290 
through two or three hundred and so yeah
I<00:07:15.540> mean<00:07:15.840> you<00:07:15.900> can<00:07:16.020> buy<00:07:16.140> it<00:07:16.200> off<00:07:16.410> the<00:07:16.440> shelf<00:07:16.800> and

00:07:17.290 --> 00:07:17.300 
I mean you can buy it off the shelf and

00:07:17.300 --> 00:07:20.420 
I mean you can buy it off the shelf and
if<00:07:18.300> you<00:07:18.480> know<00:07:18.600> how<00:07:18.720> to<00:07:18.750> do<00:07:18.960> it<00:07:19.140> use<00:07:19.980> hard<00:07:20.310> brow

00:07:20.420 --> 00:07:20.430 
if you know how to do it use hard brow

00:07:20.430 --> 00:07:22.520 
if you know how to do it use hard brow
acceleration<00:07:21.300> and<00:07:21.690> I<00:07:21.960> mean<00:07:22.080> there's<00:07:22.260> a<00:07:22.290> lot<00:07:22.440> of

00:07:22.520 --> 00:07:22.530 
acceleration and I mean there's a lot of

00:07:22.530 --> 00:07:26.720 
acceleration and I mean there's a lot of
programs<00:07:22.680> like<00:07:24.680> Nick<00:07:25.680> Adobe<00:07:26.100> is<00:07:26.220> sweet

00:07:26.720 --> 00:07:26.730 
programs like Nick Adobe is sweet

00:07:26.730 --> 00:07:29.150 
programs like Nick Adobe is sweet
a<00:07:26.790> lot<00:07:27.060> of<00:07:27.090> their<00:07:27.300> programs<00:07:27.750> use<00:07:28.710> hard<00:07:29.010> well

00:07:29.150 --> 00:07:29.160 
a lot of their programs use hard well

00:07:29.160 --> 00:07:34.280 
a lot of their programs use hard well
hardware<00:07:29.880> acceleration<00:07:30.770> and<00:07:31.770> I<00:07:32.250> think<00:07:33.290> it's

00:07:34.280 --> 00:07:34.290 
hardware acceleration and I think it's

00:07:34.290 --> 00:07:35.750 
hardware acceleration and I think it's
just<00:07:34.440> gonna<00:07:34.560> become<00:07:34.680> more<00:07:34.980> common<00:07:35.490> and

00:07:35.750 --> 00:07:35.760 
just gonna become more common and

00:07:35.760 --> 00:07:40.100 
just gonna become more common and
interesting<00:07:37.790> okay<00:07:38.790> that's<00:07:39.150> all<00:07:39.330> I<00:07:39.360> got<00:07:39.720> thanks

00:07:40.100 --> 00:07:40.110 
interesting okay that's all I got thanks

00:07:40.110 --> 00:07:43.430 
interesting okay that's all I got thanks
