00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:06.580
 It is a start from the Japanese song series 

00:00:02.980 --> 00:00:09.580
 Yes that series 

00:00:06.580 --> 00:00:15.730
 Nobody bronchial Ya for the period Board members also 

00:00:09.580 --> 00:00:22.060
 Really So what the period who died the way a sense of is contributed to only the eyes only member 

00:00:15.730 --> 00:00:26.600
 It's not that way then I think so too much and I want to work 

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:32.960
 Asano Ayano Music Noyusha is pleased and willing to do it by fear 

00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:35.530
 I think that you and the other after reason you were it is that or not is the most nuclear appropriate 

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:39.829
 He wants to 

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:43.719
 4 20 years with it already working 

00:00:39.829 --> 00:00:43.719
 I 'm trying to catch a plan configuration 

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:51.790
 There are many episodes but yes 

00:00:50.019 --> 00:00:55.350
 But it is 

00:00:51.790 --> 00:01:00.750
 It was a lot of deep stuff, just that 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:01:04.710
 The teacher who thinks in the first concert will come and do the commentary 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:05.330
 Such a story like that is also true 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:10.310
 U 

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:14.760
 I wonder if it would be good if some form became public when I was far away 

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:22.860
 It might be a bit impossible, but that sound is all left 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:25.510
 Oh yes I was a teacher Yes yes I really have that story 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:28.940
 I like the values of that concert 

00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:30.710
 People who are looking forward to it are also very good 

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:33.890
 I was there 

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:36.840
 Well, of course everyone works hard 

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:40.960
 I wonder what that is 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:43.300
 Yes you know 

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:49.120
 How are you? 

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:52.210
 3 already there are a lot of things we do not know 

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:56.770
 The other also any other composer side of another large festival seat 

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:57.720
 What also of Rassharu know that teacher together Is all in real time in the episode 

00:01:56.770 --> 00:02:02.820
 When 

00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:11.710
 It sounds like it will be natural when you give it to me 

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:15.270
 It really works really well I remember the tree 

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:15.270
 It seems that it will not come soon 

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:24.630
 I do not hear what's already so much 

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:24.630
 Yes It is now Yet Yes fast left and right are likely to 

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:36.590
 It was dirt that was about 4 or 5 people in Esaka 

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:42.069
 At that time in and more people work with Kano that the absorption layer celebrity that work of that mountain there are many Well 

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:42.069
 Such Ya I do not do or do third class per person 

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:50.270
 There are also people who will actually sing in the future 

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:52.819
 Usually the first eight children 

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:54.340

 It is that the Al Maha cod teacher was raised been discontinued 

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:23.850

00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:09.540
 The game is over even outside 

00:05:06.310 --> 00:05:09.540

 There is still a lot of myself too soon 

00:05:53.080 --> 00:06:02.420
 It says it and the snow of another field 

00:05:56.500 --> 00:06:07.540
 It is another kind of what either way from the time I met I still first of you I'm not that 

00:06:02.420 --> 00:06:07.540

 There are many more things that the teacher was talking about at the concert 

00:06:40.199 --> 00:06:43.200
 a 

00:06:41.070 --> 00:06:47.130
 Somehow it 

00:06:43.200 --> 00:06:50.160

00:06:47.130 --> 00:06:52.090
 That that recording says all things 

00:06:50.160 --> 00:06:55.600
