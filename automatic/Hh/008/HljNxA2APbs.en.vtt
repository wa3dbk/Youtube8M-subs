00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:08.990
 good in today I bring you 

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:12.889
 a super application that I know what 

00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:16.990
 for more memory that comes internal now 

00:00:12.889 --> 00:00:16.990
 you always fall short 

00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:25.020
 for example to the fifa in gta san andreas 

00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:25.020
 those games never detect you 

00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:32.369
 the memory did not have good space this 

00:00:29.110 --> 00:00:36.540
 application is called director and bing 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:38.340
 highlights what you do note here 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:41.670
 I have the fifa 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:45.420
 what it does is that the archives of the 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:50.039
 folder that appears above figure 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:52.610
 how are they in the address below if 

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:54.770
 well it is not understood but good 

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:58.120
 they have to be root yes or yes if not 

00:00:54.770 --> 00:01:02.360
 they knew the mister can not do it 

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:04.610
 let's say at at you entry 

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:07.910
 and here they will find the address where 

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:09.940
 is the game that does not fit into the 

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:13.180
 internal memory because it has no space 

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:13.180
 for here 

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:23.880
 stora managers is the core 1 android 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:26.970
 or drink in this case and the fixed forward 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:29.580
 select and here address where you have 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:32.520
 to figure that the default address 

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:34.020
 where it is worth playing 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:36.649
 here 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:36.649
 I will be 

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:42.530
 here what to say and look 

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:44.960
 that many owes yes to pass 

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:47.100
 let's not put that the prosecutor 14 look 

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:49.110
 what will appear 

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:52.520
 will appear to connect a speed of 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:52.520
 download there is no space 

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:57.400
 the we drew 

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:04.659
 I hate this when it is guided by gravel 

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:08.310
 we add it 

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:14.950
 you have to give the green diskette so that 

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:17.860
 I recognized it 

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:21.480
 and see now what 

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:21.480
 already appears the fifa
