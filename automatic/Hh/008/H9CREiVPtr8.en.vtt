00:00:00.333 --> 00:00:01.666
- WE DIVIDED THE CAST
INTO TEAMS,

00:00:01.666 --> 00:00:03.700
THE WHITE HOUSE VERSUS
OLIVIA POPE AND ASSOCIATES.

00:00:03.700 --> 00:00:05.600
WE'VE ASKED EVERYONE
BEFORE THE SHOW

00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:07.333
TO TELL US A SECRET
ABOUT THEMSELVES

00:00:07.333 --> 00:00:08.666
THEIR CASTMATES
WOULD NOT KNOW,

00:00:08.666 --> 00:00:10.200
'CAUSE THEY KNOW EACH OTHER
SO WELL.

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:11.800
ONE PERSON FROM EACH TEAM
WILL COME UP.

00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:13.033
I WILL READ THE SECRET,

00:00:13.033 --> 00:00:15.333

00:00:17.033 --> 00:00:19.366
IF THEY GET IT WRONG,
THE OTHER TEAM CAN STEAL.

00:00:19.366 --> 00:00:22.733
WE ONLY HAVE NINE CAST MEMBERS.
WE NEED ONE MORE ON THIS SIDE.

00:00:22.733 --> 00:00:24.600
SO WHERE
IS CARLY APPLEGATE?

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:26.733
- WAIT, WAIT, WAIT, WAIT, WAIT,
WAIT, WAIT, WAIT, WAIT.

00:00:26.733 --> 00:00:27.733
I'M SORRY.
YOU KNOW WHAT?

00:00:27.733 --> 00:00:28.833
I'M A LITTLE UNCOMFORTABLE.

00:00:28.833 --> 00:00:30.300
BUT I'M NOT GOOD
AT KEEPING SECRETS,

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:32.566
SO I WANT TO--I WANT TO CONFESS
MY SECRET RIGHT AWAY.

00:00:32.566 --> 00:00:34.900
EXCUSE ME.

00:00:57.766 --> 00:00:59.300
[cheers and applause]

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:01.766
HOW'D YOU DO THAT?

00:01:01.766 --> 00:01:03.633
OH, MY GOD.

SO WE WANTED TO OFFER YOU

00:01:10.233 --> 00:01:11.666
WITH ANOTHER CAST MEMBER.

00:01:11.666 --> 00:01:12.833
- I WAS SO SHOCKED.

00:01:12.833 --> 00:01:14.300
I WAS LIKE,
"WHY DID YOU STOP TEXTING ME?"

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:15.600
WE HAD BEEN TEXTING ALL DAY,

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:17.100
AND THEN ALL OF A SUDDEN,
IT STOPPED.

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:19.433
- MYSTERIOUSLY STOPPED.

00:01:19.433 --> 00:01:20.833

00:01:20.833 --> 00:01:22.733
[cheers and applause]

00:01:22.733 --> 00:01:25.066
ALL RIGHT.
THAT'S HILARIOUS.

00:01:25.066 --> 00:01:26.766
SO THERE'S PROBABLY
NO CARLY APPLEGATE.

00:01:26.766 --> 00:01:28.800
THAT WAS A FAKE NAME
OR SOMETHING.

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:30.266

00:01:56.566 --> 00:01:59.033
SCARED THAT
I'M GONNA BE ARRESTED."

00:01:59.033 --> 00:02:00.533
[buzzer dinging]

00:02:00.533 --> 00:02:02.900

- [shouting indistinctly]

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:17.300
- I DON'T THINK THAT.

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:19.866

DO NOT GIVE HIM ANOTHER CHANCE.

00:02:19.866 --> 00:02:21.733

THAT PORTIA'S HERE.

00:02:21.733 --> 00:02:24.433

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:50.100

00:05:10.333 --> 00:05:12.066
- HOW IS IT YOU NEVER TOLD US
THAT STORY?

00:05:12.066 --> 00:05:15.100
- IT'S MULTIPLE TRAFFIC OFFENSES
THAT I WAS ARRESTED--

00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:16.966
ONE--IN ONE PRECINCT.

00:05:16.966 --> 00:05:18.533
THEY THEN TOOK ME
TO ANOTHER PRECINCT,

00:05:18.533 --> 00:05:19.900
WHERE THEY ARRESTED ME,

00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:21.833
AND THE THIRD PRECINCT
DIDN'T WANT TO COME GET ME,

00:05:21.833 --> 00:05:23.266
SO THAT SECOND PRECINCT
ARRESTED ME

00:05:23.266 --> 00:05:24.266
FOR THE THIRD PRECINCT.

00:05:24.266 --> 00:05:25.466
