00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:07.950
 The way we know it's made for 

00:00:03.529 --> 00:00:10.410
 we generate drawings accurately but 

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:12.840
 if you want to generate some design 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:15.410
 free hand is also possible 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:18.510
 there is a command called the sketch 

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:21.150
 I swear that way 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:23.189
 and then this sketch works from 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:26.400
 The next way you have a 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:28.289
 configuration on the called implement that 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:30.929
 increment the following when you click 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:33.960
 the beginning of the movement movement that the 

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:37.530
 you will measure it gives me when this 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:39.600
 measure here that is the increment it does 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:41.760
 it fixes a line 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:44.309
 so the bigger you put it 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:46.469
 here more time you move so that 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:49.800
 he does a fixed wipe 

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:52.770
 My name is Temporary while I go 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:54.629
 apply incrementally and I will not 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:58.170
 typing, I will click on the screen that 

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:59.309
 distance when from here I 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:03.270
 I'm watching on the screen. 

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:05.040
 he is going to generate a line what I 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:07.229
 I wanted to say this is the cliche is so 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:09.330
 handled for the time being provisional 

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:09.960
 line from that distance it fixes 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:13.380
 line 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:15.420
 He's making the line for me to imagine. 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:18.540
 my drawing has to be done in 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:22.049
 stepladder is happening because I 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:23.400
 I'm running f8 on or off f8 

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:25.409
 he can make the lines too 

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:26.460
 inclined sister wants to be much more 

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:30.570
 free 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:33.180
 so the sketch is used for this 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:36.570
 the skit is not convenient to use 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:40.079
 command the garden option when you 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:41.579
 want to finish the command you click and give 

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:43.470
 wrong interpretation 

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:45.329
 if you do not want to close if you want 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:47.610
 continue you can start to do bad 

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:51.030
 per line click to start over 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:53.009
 here to do another click again 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:55.470
 continue here when you should understand 

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:58.200
 to it common saw the last detail 

00:01:55.470 --> 00:02:02.070
 when you click one on your day 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:04.079
 object are only several lines for 

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:07.350
 transform to make it there 

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:08.789
 When do you want to draw behave? 

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:11.099
 like a pulley, right? 

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:13.180
 so that you have instead of several 

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:17.980
 lines and has several controversies 

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:21.489
 has a variable called sk pole in having 

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:25.120
 to put value 1 is quiet 

00:02:21.489 --> 00:02:27.099
 in your eyes qat again and the value 

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:29.829
 of that variable has equal to 1 

00:02:27.099 --> 00:02:32.920
 You're going to draw something here in 

00:02:29.829 --> 00:02:34.810
 have and it will all be a single 

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:39.659
 police when you click because the 

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:39.659
 value of the sk pole variable is equal
