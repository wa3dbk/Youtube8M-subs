00:00:09.709 --> 00:00:09.719 
surround sound and how do you place your

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:11.209 
surround sound and how do you place your
speakers<00:00:10.170> to<00:00:10.380> get<00:00:10.530> the<00:00:10.650> most<00:00:10.830> out<00:00:11.070> of<00:00:11.099> your

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:14.790 
surround sound so we got three different

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:16.700 
surround sound so we got three different
kinds<00:00:15.150> of<00:00:15.420> surround<00:00:15.719> sound<00:00:16.020> in<00:00:16.230> general<00:00:16.560> that

kinds of surround sound in general that

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:21.590 
kinds of surround sound in general that
we're<00:00:16.830> talking<00:00:16.980> about<00:00:17.220> here<00:00:17.779> 5.1<00:00:19.160> 6.1<00:00:20.160> and<00:00:20.600> 7.1

sets of speakers that are placed around
the<00:00:28.170> room<00:00:28.260> and<00:00:28.619> you<00:00:29.029> have<00:00:30.029> the<00:00:30.300> dot<00:00:30.539> one<00:00:30.869> which

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:31.199 
the room and you have the dot one which

location<00:01:48.360> it<00:01:48.720> gets<00:01:49.439> to<00:01:49.560> be<00:01:49.680> what<00:01:49.890> works<00:01:50.130> with

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280 
location it gets to be what works with

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:54.620 
location it gets to be what works with
your<00:01:50.460> decor<00:01:51.590> the<00:01:52.590> 6.1<00:01:53.100> would<00:01:53.970> take<00:01:54.180> those<00:01:54.420> two

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:54.630 
your decor the 6.1 would take those two

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:58.100 
your decor the 6.1 would take those two
sides<00:01:54.899> and<00:01:55.140> add<00:01:55.259> one<00:01:55.560> in<00:01:55.680> the<00:01:55.770> center<00:01:56.450> and<00:01:57.450> then

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.110 
sides and add one in the center and then

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:01.370 
sides and add one in the center and then
the<00:01:58.259> 7.1<00:01:58.799> would<00:01:59.790> say<00:02:00.090> you<00:02:00.689> have<00:02:00.810> both<00:02:00.990> the<00:02:01.170> side

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:01.380 
the 7.1 would say you have both the side

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:04.760 
the 7.1 would say you have both the side
and<00:02:01.710> the<00:02:01.860> rear<00:02:02.040> on<00:02:02.369> either<00:02:02.939> side<00:02:03.299> with<00:02:04.049> nothing

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:04.770 
and the rear on either side with nothing

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:07.459 
and the rear on either side with nothing
in<00:02:04.890> the<00:02:04.950> center<00:02:05.280> in<00:02:05.460> the<00:02:05.490> back<00:02:06.320> here's<00:02:07.320> the

00:02:07.459 --> 00:02:07.469 
in the center in the back here's the

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:09.800 
in the center in the back here's the
catch<00:02:07.649> though<00:02:07.970> even<00:02:08.970> though<00:02:09.060> you<00:02:09.119> look<00:02:09.390> at<00:02:09.629> all

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:09.810 
catch though even though you look at all

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:10.820 
catch though even though you look at all
these<00:02:09.929> things<00:02:09.989> that<00:02:10.319> you<00:02:10.379> know<00:02:10.470> you<00:02:10.530> say<00:02:10.619> like

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:10.830 
these things that you know you say like

these things that you know you say like
well<00:02:11.009> obviously<00:02:11.459> I<00:02:11.760> have<00:02:11.970> to<00:02:12.060> have<00:02:12.209> 7.1<00:02:12.870> in

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:13.180 
well obviously I have to have 7.1 in

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:15.959 
well obviously I have to have 7.1 in
2007<00:02:13.989> there<00:02:14.200> are<00:02:14.290> virtually<00:02:14.530> no<00:02:14.980> signals<00:02:15.849> that

00:02:15.959 --> 00:02:15.969 
2007 there are virtually no signals that

00:02:15.969 --> 00:02:18.449 
2007 there are virtually no signals that
are<00:02:16.120> coming<00:02:16.420> from<00:02:16.599> any<00:02:16.780> DVDs<00:02:17.290> or<00:02:17.650> TVs<00:02:18.129> that<00:02:18.400> are

are coming from any DVDs or TVs that are
coming<00:02:18.849> out<00:02:18.969> in<00:02:19.349> 7.1<00:02:20.430> almost<00:02:21.430> everything<00:02:22.090> is

00:02:22.369 --> 00:02:22.379 
coming out in 7.1 almost everything is

00:02:22.379 --> 00:02:26.039 
coming out in 7.1 almost everything is
5.1<00:02:23.379> you<00:02:23.890> just<00:02:24.129> do<00:02:24.609> not<00:02:24.640> find<00:02:25.060> that<00:02:25.239> it<00:02:25.450> really

00:02:26.039 --> 00:02:26.049 
5.1 you just do not find that it really

00:02:26.049 --> 00:02:27.539 
5.1 you just do not find that it really
is<00:02:26.230> not<00:02:26.260> it's<00:02:26.739> it's<00:02:26.950> a<00:02:27.040> subtle<00:02:27.430> difference

00:02:27.539 --> 00:02:27.549 
is not it's it's a subtle difference

00:02:27.549 --> 00:02:29.009 
is not it's it's a subtle difference
between<00:02:28.090> whether<00:02:28.269> the<00:02:28.390> sound<00:02:28.599> is<00:02:28.719> coming<00:02:28.870> from

00:02:29.009 --> 00:02:29.019 
between whether the sound is coming from

00:02:29.019 --> 00:02:32.160 
between whether the sound is coming from
from<00:02:29.760> right<00:02:30.760> behind<00:02:30.969> you<00:02:31.329> or<00:02:31.569> a<00:02:31.599> little<00:02:31.840> little

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:32.170 
from right behind you or a little little

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:34.259 
from right behind you or a little little
behind<00:02:32.530> you<00:02:32.769> so<00:02:33.430> there's<00:02:33.579> really<00:02:33.790> not<00:02:34.000> that

00:02:34.259 --> 00:02:34.269 
behind you so there's really not that

00:02:34.269 --> 00:02:35.699 
behind you so there's really not that
much<00:02:34.450> but<00:02:34.629> ever<00:02:34.810> now<00:02:34.959> what<00:02:35.200> we<00:02:35.319> see<00:02:35.530> that

00:02:35.699 --> 00:02:35.709 
much but ever now what we see that

00:02:35.709 --> 00:02:37.770 
much but ever now what we see that
happen<00:02:35.980> in<00:02:36.040> the<00:02:36.129> future<00:02:36.250> I<00:02:36.659> don't<00:02:37.659> know<00:02:37.750> I

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:37.780 
happen in the future I don't know I

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:41.129 
happen in the future I don't know I
don't<00:02:38.109> have<00:02:38.260> a<00:02:38.290> crystal<00:02:38.530> ball<00:02:38.829> but<00:02:39.810> all<00:02:40.810> I<00:02:40.870> can

00:02:41.129 --> 00:02:41.139 
don't have a crystal ball but all I can

00:02:41.139 --> 00:02:44.220 
don't have a crystal ball but all I can
tell<00:02:41.260> you<00:02:41.409> is<00:02:41.530> that<00:02:41.560> right<00:02:41.799> now<00:02:42.540> you<00:02:43.540> can<00:02:43.810> you

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:44.230 
tell you is that right now you can you

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:46.110 
tell you is that right now you can you
can<00:02:44.379> get<00:02:44.530> away<00:02:44.650> with<00:02:44.980> having<00:02:45.069> 5.1<00:02:45.790> and<00:02:45.970> not

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:46.120 
can get away with having 5.1 and not

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:48.119 
can get away with having 5.1 and not
worry<00:02:46.389> about<00:02:46.480> spending<00:02:47.200> the<00:02:47.319> money<00:02:47.590> on<00:02:47.680> the

00:02:48.119 --> 00:02:48.129 
worry about spending the money on the

00:02:48.129 --> 00:02:50.879 
worry about spending the money on the
two<00:02:48.310> more<00:02:48.489> speakers<00:02:48.790> if<00:02:49.540> you<00:02:49.750> have<00:02:49.959> your<00:02:50.379> if

00:02:50.879 --> 00:02:50.889 
two more speakers if you have your if

00:02:50.889 --> 00:02:53.879 
two more speakers if you have your if
you<00:02:51.099> have<00:02:51.129> a<00:02:51.540> open<00:02:52.540> open<00:02:53.260> environment<00:02:53.799> where

00:02:53.879 --> 00:02:53.889 
you have a open open environment where

00:02:53.889 --> 00:02:55.530 
you have a open open environment where
you<00:02:54.010> can<00:02:54.220> put<00:02:54.579> wires<00:02:54.819> behind<00:02:55.060> the<00:02:55.329> walls

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:55.540 
you can put wires behind the walls

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:58.229 
you can put wires behind the walls
probably<00:02:56.439> worthwhile<00:02:56.769> to<00:02:57.250> wire<00:02:57.459> up<00:02:57.730> the<00:02:57.849> seven

00:02:58.229 --> 00:02:58.239 
probably worthwhile to wire up the seven

00:02:58.239 --> 00:03:00.449 
probably worthwhile to wire up the seven
speakers<00:02:58.959> but<00:02:59.230> maybe<00:02:59.409> not<00:02:59.620> purchase<00:03:00.099> them<00:03:00.250> yet

00:03:00.449 --> 00:03:00.459 
speakers but maybe not purchase them yet

00:03:00.459 --> 00:03:02.429 
speakers but maybe not purchase them yet
have<00:03:01.389> the<00:03:01.540> wires<00:03:01.750> in<00:03:01.930> the<00:03:02.019> wall<00:03:02.169> so<00:03:02.409> that

00:03:02.429 --> 00:03:02.439 
have the wires in the wall so that

00:03:02.439 --> 00:03:03.990 
have the wires in the wall so that
you'll<00:03:02.650> be<00:03:02.739> hooked<00:03:02.919> them<00:03:03.069> up<00:03:03.189> be<00:03:03.639> able<00:03:03.790> to<00:03:03.879> hook

00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:04.000 
you'll be hooked them up be able to hook

them up someday when that 7.1 signals
