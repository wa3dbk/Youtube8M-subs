00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:38.520 
military which is quite possible I'm

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:41.229 
military which is quite possible I'm
convinced<00:00:39.000> that<00:00:39.390> craft<00:00:39.719> was<00:00:40.020> almost

00:00:41.229 --> 00:00:41.239 
convinced that craft was almost

00:00:41.239 --> 00:00:43.880 
convinced that craft was almost
certainly<00:00:42.239> shocked<00:00:42.899> down<00:00:43.200> and<00:00:43.500> it<00:00:43.620> was<00:00:43.739> in

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890 
certainly shocked down and it was in

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:46.700 
certainly shocked down and it was in
perfect<00:00:44.129> condition<00:00:44.399> there<00:00:45.390> were<00:00:45.570> at<00:00:46.230> least<00:00:46.260> a

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
perfect condition there were at least a

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:49.610 
perfect condition there were at least a
dozen<00:00:46.940> small<00:00:47.940> bodies<00:00:48.420> inside<00:00:48.870> but<00:00:49.140> they<00:00:49.350> had

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620 
dozen small bodies inside but they had

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:52.340 
dozen small bodies inside but they had
been<00:00:49.890> or<00:00:50.850> appeared<00:00:51.539> to<00:00:51.600> have<00:00:51.809> been<00:00:51.989> burnt

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350 
been or appeared to have been burnt

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:54.439 
been or appeared to have been burnt
there<00:00:52.680> was<00:00:52.770> no<00:00:52.920> fire<00:00:53.219> involved<00:00:53.850> but<00:00:54.030> because

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449 
there was no fire involved but because

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:56.779 
there was no fire involved but because
apparently<00:00:55.230> the<00:00:55.500> atmosphere<00:00:56.010> just<00:00:56.219> simply

00:00:56.779 --> 00:00:56.789 
apparently the atmosphere just simply

00:00:56.789 --> 00:00:58.670 
apparently the atmosphere just simply
wasn't<00:00:56.969> right<00:00:57.270> for<00:00:57.300> them<00:00:57.629> and<00:00:57.660> this<00:00:58.350> has<00:00:58.469> been

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
wasn't right for them and this has been

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:00.770 
wasn't right for them and this has been
confirmed<00:00:59.100> by<00:00:59.250> a<00:00:59.370> number<00:00:59.579> of<00:00:59.730> sources<00:01:00.000> it's

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
confirmed by a number of sources it's

he's hopefully are going to produce a
book<00:01:22.439> just<00:01:22.920> on<00:01:23.159> the<00:01:23.280> a<00:01:23.310> staircase<00:01:23.729> and<00:01:24.240> we<00:01:24.420> we

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
book just on the a staircase and we we

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:26.690 
book just on the a staircase and we we
should<00:01:25.200> look<00:01:25.380> forward<00:01:25.619> to<00:01:25.770> that<00:01:25.920> it's

people would have extracted the

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:39.140 
people would have extracted the
technology<00:01:36.360> from<00:01:36.659> the<00:01:36.689> Aztec<00:01:37.320> craft<00:01:38.150> Philip

together<00:01:48.090> with<00:01:48.299> general<00:01:48.630> Trudeau<00:01:49.049> because<00:01:49.770> if

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
together with general Trudeau because if

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:51.679 
together with general Trudeau because if
I<00:01:50.070> was<00:01:50.220> in<00:01:50.340> his<00:01:50.460> shoes<00:01:50.640> I<00:01:50.850> would<00:01:51.000> say<00:01:51.180> well<00:01:51.420> I

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:51.689 
I was in his shoes I would say well I

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:53.510 
I was in his shoes I would say well I
don't<00:01:51.930> want<00:01:52.200> the<00:01:52.259> crashed<00:01:52.530> one<00:01:52.770> I<00:01:53.040> want<00:01:53.430> the

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.520 
don't want the crashed one I want the

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:55.730 
don't want the crashed one I want the
whole<00:01:53.670> one<00:01:53.939> so<00:01:54.780> do<00:01:55.140> you<00:01:55.229> think<00:01:55.380> he<00:01:55.500> would<00:01:55.649> have

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:55.740 
whole one so do you think he would have

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:58.520 
whole one so do you think he would have

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:00.380 
had his hands on the Aztec UFO well
maybe<00:01:58.969> everything's<00:01:59.969> on<00:02:00.090> a<00:02:00.119> need-to-know

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:00.390 
maybe everything's on a need-to-know

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:04.010 
maybe everything's on a need-to-know
basis<00:02:01.110> you<00:02:01.320> know<00:02:01.439> maybe<00:02:02.420> Trudeau<00:02:03.420> and<00:02:03.750> course

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:04.020 
basis you know maybe Trudeau and course
