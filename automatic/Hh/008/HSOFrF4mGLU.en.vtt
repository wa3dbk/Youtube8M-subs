00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:27.739 
do usually has really good reactions I
think<00:03:26.609> that<00:03:26.730> it<00:03:26.879> might<00:03:26.969> just<00:03:27.150> be<00:03:27.299> a<00:03:27.329> bit<00:03:27.659> of

00:03:27.739 --> 00:03:27.749 
think that it might just be a bit of

00:03:27.749 --> 00:03:29.599 
think that it might just be a bit of
unfamiliarity<00:03:28.200> with<00:03:28.530> the<00:03:28.650> character<00:03:29.159> I<00:03:29.340> mean

00:03:29.599 --> 00:03:29.609 
unfamiliarity with the character I mean

00:03:29.609 --> 00:03:31.580 
unfamiliarity with the character I mean
I<00:03:29.700> think<00:03:29.730> for<00:03:30.719> ago<00:03:30.959> just<00:03:31.170> picked<00:03:31.319> them<00:03:31.409> right

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:31.590 
I think for ago just picked them right

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:35.869 
I think for ago just picked them right
that<00:03:31.829> time<00:03:32.930> host<00:03:33.930> scoop<00:03:34.530> poop<00:03:34.920> ET<00:03:35.189> du<00:03:35.370> dog<00:03:35.609> that

00:03:35.869 --> 00:03:35.879 
that time host scoop poop ET du dog that

00:03:35.879 --> 00:03:38.390 
that time host scoop poop ET du dog that
was<00:03:35.969> good<00:03:36.239> why<00:03:36.540> grab<00:03:37.019> that<00:03:37.290> yeah<00:03:37.950> you<00:03:38.010> could<00:03:38.310> do

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:38.400 
was good why grab that yeah you could do

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:40.039 
was good why grab that yeah you could do
that<00:03:38.430> yeah<00:03:38.969> it<00:03:39.359> wasn't<00:03:39.510> off<00:03:39.689> the<00:03:39.780> ground<00:03:39.989> yet

00:03:40.039 --> 00:03:40.049 
that yeah it wasn't off the ground yet

00:03:40.049 --> 00:03:45.319 
that yeah it wasn't off the ground yet
oh<00:03:40.409> my<00:03:40.980> that's<00:03:41.609> pretty<00:03:42.239> interesting<00:03:42.510> I<00:03:44.329> guess

00:03:45.319 --> 00:03:45.329 
oh my that's pretty interesting I guess

00:03:45.329 --> 00:03:47.509 
oh my that's pretty interesting I guess
it<00:03:45.450> doesn't<00:03:45.599> have<00:03:45.780> invincibility<00:03:46.319> after<00:03:46.799> so

00:03:47.509 --> 00:03:47.519 
it doesn't have invincibility after so

00:03:47.519 --> 00:03:49.459 
it doesn't have invincibility after so
it<00:03:47.909> doesn't<00:03:48.180> that<00:03:48.269> there's<00:03:48.569> no<00:03:48.810> frames<00:03:49.169> where

00:03:49.459 --> 00:03:49.469 
it doesn't that there's no frames where

00:03:49.469 --> 00:03:50.569 
it doesn't that there's no frames where
it's<00:03:49.590> grounded<00:03:50.040> and<00:03:50.189> doesn't<00:03:50.489> have

00:03:50.569 --> 00:03:50.579 
it's grounded and doesn't have

00:03:50.579 --> 00:03:52.099 
it's grounded and doesn't have
invincibility<00:03:51.060> apparently<00:03:51.689> that's<00:03:51.870> the<00:03:51.959> case

00:03:52.099 --> 00:03:52.109 
invincibility apparently that's the case

00:03:52.109 --> 00:03:59.809 
invincibility apparently that's the case
yeah<00:03:52.469> interesting<00:03:56.060> nice<00:03:58.129> but<00:03:59.129> it<00:03:59.340> just<00:03:59.639> comes

00:03:59.809 --> 00:03:59.819 
yeah interesting nice but it just comes

00:03:59.819 --> 00:04:01.879 
yeah interesting nice but it just comes
in<00:04:00.090> a<00:04:00.120> little<00:04:00.269> bit<00:04:00.449> too<00:04:00.569> recklessly<00:04:01.079> he's<00:04:01.739> got
