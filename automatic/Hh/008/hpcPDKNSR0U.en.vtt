00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.629
 there are good all boys and girls 

00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:04.380
 we are in monster hunter 3 last and of 

00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:06.660
 wii 

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:09.120
 I have a game in which we will all go 

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:13.679
 with the equipment of artillerymen of 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:16.790
 Equinox too and we'll take from Arc to 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:16.790
 great kevin bow 

00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:21.550
 good one of the best game for not 

00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:24.390
 say the best of the game since it has 

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:24.390
 all the states 

00:00:24.430 --> 00:00:31.030
 and not only that, but his drool 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:33.270
 will limit the game only by touching xxx 

00:00:31.030 --> 00:00:35.940
 without any charge 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:38.280
 in my humble opinion 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:41.100
 the equipment is fine if you use it 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:45.420
 correctly let's say it's a 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:48.269
 equipment to put states not 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:51.000
 to attack to attack if you believe yes 

00:00:48.269 --> 00:00:52.620
 yes because more than anything in this game it 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:56.940
 It limits people when they take this box 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:01:01.430
 this equipment is to play xxxx shoots 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:01.430
 without charging or even states 

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:06.580
 if you use well states it is going very 

00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:09.100
 well as support but 

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:12.290
 in this game I already tell you that it will be limited 

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:14.800
 to shoot and as soon as possible 

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:18.440
 the damage of the waters is quite large 

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:19.860
 shoots 5 at the same time and does not require 

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:22.410
 much more 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:24.630
 but to do this there are other 

00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:27.630
 better equipment such as helios or 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:30.450
 the one of normal cross asia or the cross of 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:32.490
 marmolejo also that is very good if 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:35.060
 do you want to play xxx then or doing with 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:35.060
 that transition 

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:43.000
 instructor has an attack 

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:43.000
 the best would be theirs without a doubt 

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:49.700
 should be chosen xx 

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:51.770
 and this is to put states for that 

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:53.920
 It leads to a harder state gets an 

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:56.580
 been more 2 

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:58.310
 now I'm listening correctly 

00:01:56.580 --> 00:02:00.470
 paralyzing 

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:03.730
 in the drool 

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:03.730
 also the poisons 

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:09.780
 and as you see I said they were just powers 

00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:11.880
 in 6 

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:14.110
 is that in this game most undo 

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:16.940
 this team 

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:20.710
 for its ease 

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:20.710
 that you only have to touch a button 

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:24.840
 a button to eat 

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:41.590
 I agree that Drool 

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:43.460
 perform 

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:46.250
 is that there is no other 

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:50.069
 you have to touch a button not even if 

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:52.260
 you want you can look the other way 

00:02:50.069 --> 00:02:56.569
 as long as you have the bug in front and 

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:56.569
 hit the X until he dies 

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:05.140
 Now I go without coating because 

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:05.140
 it really does not need heat 

00:03:07.210 --> 00:03:11.320
 we already have the second most scored here 

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:13.360
 to live all here lasts the first are from 

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:15.080
 range that by the way are not of rank 

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:17.120
 normal 

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:21.170
 range costs that you already know that the 

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:24.760
 life that takes place a lot when you're 

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:24.760
 and individuals on screen 

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:30.610
 we change to poison while it is 

00:03:29.210 --> 00:03:33.090
 paralyzed I'm going to poison him 

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:33.090
 today 

00:03:33.990 --> 00:03:36.680
 are you going to do 

00:03:56.240 --> 00:03:59.530
 look, we're going to take you out 

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:04.110
 until you eliminate many 

00:04:06.850 --> 00:04:11.230
 This is the fastest way to kill 

00:04:09.130 --> 00:04:13.180
 this bug would not be like we are 

00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:15.790
 doing us 

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:18.910
 with crossbows the crossbows are much 

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:20.709
 stronger also with states is more 

00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:23.570
 as a sense that you have by your side 

00:04:20.709 --> 00:04:25.180
 let it be your surplus 

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:28.000
 we are going 

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:30.699
 being the entity otherwise the 

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:32.970
 attacker are made super super games 

00:04:30.699 --> 00:04:32.970
 plus 

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:39.440
 or the next the region 

00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:42.640
 go gold robot 

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:42.640
 he is poisoned 

00:04:51.470 --> 00:04:55.870
 so that it is a little quiet 

00:04:56.620 --> 00:05:01.600
 and giving him with álava is very spectacular 

00:04:59.650 --> 00:05:04.470
 the truth that the short one a lot especially 

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:07.170
 when it explodes but 

00:05:04.470 --> 00:05:10.940
 the games is limited that's just to a 

00:05:07.170 --> 00:05:13.040
 button what gives me a lot 

00:05:10.940 --> 00:05:14.750
 because it's that you do not even have 

00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:17.570
 use it correctly 

00:05:14.750 --> 00:05:21.410
 zarco is like this I want I do not bring 

00:05:17.570 --> 00:05:23.660
 paralyzing neither poison nor sing and 

00:05:21.410 --> 00:05:25.940
 no energy any type of arrow and 

00:05:23.660 --> 00:05:30.040
 I go with lining alone and it's the 

00:05:25.940 --> 00:05:32.840
 button does not even load the shots 

00:05:30.040 --> 00:05:34.870
 and the games are limited to that 

00:05:32.840 --> 00:05:36.640
 after acs 

00:05:34.870 --> 00:05:38.470
 what I already tell you is not the team 

00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:39.720
 adequate to do it the proper 

00:05:38.470 --> 00:05:42.360
 to do 

00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:46.990
 xx still says it's josep's 

00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:50.310
 for those who use this form 

00:05:46.990 --> 00:05:50.310
 and then you also have 

00:05:50.780 --> 00:05:55.689
 you have the guide and lage marmóleo that 

00:05:53.900 --> 00:05:58.509
 it also serves us 

00:05:55.689 --> 00:06:00.749
 of alternatives if you do not want to do the 

00:05:58.509 --> 00:06:00.749
 God 

00:06:00.889 --> 00:06:05.520
 Well, I hope you liked it 

00:06:03.350 --> 00:06:06.180
 I hope not to offend anyone not me 

00:06:05.520 --> 00:06:09.419
 opinion 

00:06:06.180 --> 00:06:10.650
 the bow is fine what happens that what 

00:06:09.419 --> 00:06:12.569
 that I do not see correctly is the 

00:06:10.650 --> 00:06:16.229
 use of 

00:06:12.569 --> 00:06:19.679
 do not change bullets do not use states with 

00:06:16.229 --> 00:06:23.999
 a team of states and just give it 

00:06:19.679 --> 00:06:25.409
 a button is not in my opinion good that 

00:06:23.999 --> 00:06:27.180
 there are people who will bother you there is another 

00:06:25.409 --> 00:06:29.220
 do not 

00:06:27.180 --> 00:06:32.110
 it's not how you play we have let ten and 

00:06:29.220 --> 00:06:35.080
 of course it is playing to show hunter 

00:06:32.110 --> 00:06:37.060
 and just give a button and shoot 

00:06:35.080 --> 00:06:38.770
 until you said without pointing because 

00:06:37.060 --> 00:06:43.870
 this weapon you do not even have to aim 

00:06:38.770 --> 00:06:47.260
 there are 55 shots across the width of drool 

00:06:43.870 --> 00:06:49.180
 can not be called or go hunting good 

00:06:47.260 --> 00:06:50.880
 Anyway that's failure to catch 

00:06:49.180 --> 00:06:53.410
 do not fail the people who take advantage of it 

00:06:50.880 --> 00:06:55.830
 I hope you like the video until later 

00:06:53.410 --> 00:06:55.830
 of um
