00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.969
 these will have to come here right away 

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:16.850
 the eye on the ship is not a nation not so everyone 

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:20.710
 like water do not like hand which 

00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:23.759
 created for games top 

00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:28.570
 there are good opportunities to work and 

00:00:23.759 --> 00:00:31.500
 therefore become today 

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:36.120
 question what is it 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:36.120
 I need these from me 

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:43.840
 magnificent 9 players on special 

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:46.200
 league last match on the testimony 

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:49.540
 some mean are and no 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:52.840
 problems with equal in general if to speak in 

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:56.170
 principle everything is normal here 

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:59.650
 we had a good opportunity 1 for not 

00:00:56.170 --> 00:01:01.769
 can stop then we and people time but 

00:00:59.650 --> 00:01:04.170
 who is engaged and 

00:01:01.769 --> 00:01:07.540
 the second 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:12.130
 this measure strands which will be necessary 

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:13.470
 I will do it and I think the guys will rest 

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:16.650
 championships and 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:19.280
 prepare well for a face with a mustache 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:24.260
 hares sedge serious injury not so 

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:28.370
 pure heroin how to wait she has 

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:31.370
 the problem so they are very particular about 

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:31.370
 queen 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:36.150
 played 

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:40.820
 now shower 

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:40.820
 doubt or borodin figure 

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:50.400
 find here there are the names of many such 

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:53.550
 young guys who repent 

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:55.680
 and now we are not yet ready to play 

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:59.070
 olympic team but these are candidates 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:02:01.590
 which may already sound 35 between 

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:03.720
 so I decide on this collection as 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:06.330
 could ask the main tasks of course it 

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:08.369
 preparation for the olympic games can also 

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:10.679
 time there is such an opportunity already 

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:12.690
 cook the guys of the world championship that is 

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:13.770
 great candidates who basically 

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:15.830
 should already 

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:15.830
 and 

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:20.780
 noticed there are born settings then 

00:02:18.409 --> 00:02:23.690
 appears hi-tech who neither go at once 

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:26.569
 us good things this is a good setting 

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:29.540
 We talked to you here with the guys 

00:02:26.569 --> 00:02:32.720
 said what tasks we set I think 

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:35.620
 what is the understanding of the owners because 

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:35.620
 happens and 

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:43.640
 year have the opportunity to get a team 

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:44.980
 play well did not work now we have 

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:48.780
 perspective 

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:53.500
 by faith being a movie 

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:56.340
 so everything is fine working such 

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:58.110
 some hit did not hit 

00:02:56.340 --> 00:03:00.540
 thought before the Olympiad exchanged 

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:05.360
 several matches with Latvia as it is not 

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:05.360
 afraid that this time to play 

00:03:06.019 --> 00:03:14.099
 it's not canceled because dude you 

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:16.830
 so we are not allowed to all simple 

00:03:14.099 --> 00:03:19.360
 participated in this game so we are one 

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:24.430

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:26.830
