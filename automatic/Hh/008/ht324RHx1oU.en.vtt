DIY and I went into my local Dollar Tree
store<00:00:11.700> I<00:00:11.940> actually<00:00:12.179> found<00:00:12.540> it<00:00:12.750> cute<00:00:13.099> it's<00:00:14.099> a

00:00:14.209 --> 00:00:14.219 
store I actually found it cute it's a

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:16.279 
store I actually found it cute it's a
glass<00:00:14.429> plate<00:00:14.790> a<00:00:15.089> candlestick<00:00:15.660> holder<00:00:16.109> and

00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:16.289 
glass plate a candlestick holder and

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:17.540 
glass plate a candlestick holder and
it's<00:00:16.440> matching<00:00:16.650> saucer

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:17.550 
it's matching saucer

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:19.400 
it's matching saucer
and<00:00:18.180> I<00:00:18.270> figured<00:00:18.600> if<00:00:18.690> I<00:00:18.840> put<00:00:19.140> the<00:00:19.260> three

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:19.410 
and I figured if I put the three

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:21.950 
and I figured if I put the three
together<00:00:19.560> I<00:00:19.949> could<00:00:20.520> come<00:00:20.939> up<00:00:21.119> with<00:00:21.359> something

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:21.960 
together I could come up with something

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:24.740 
together I could come up with something
to<00:00:22.680> hold<00:00:23.039> all<00:00:23.369> my<00:00:23.580> bracelets<00:00:23.789> in<00:00:24.150> because<00:00:24.449> as

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:24.750 
to hold all my bracelets in because as

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:29.529 
to hold all my bracelets in because as
of<00:00:24.930> right<00:00:24.990> now<00:00:26.449> they<00:00:27.449> are<00:00:27.480> actually<00:00:27.890> stored<00:00:28.890> in

00:00:29.529 --> 00:00:29.539 
of right now they are actually stored in

00:00:29.539 --> 00:00:33.260 
of right now they are actually stored in
this<00:00:30.539> glass<00:00:30.960> jar<00:00:31.309> the<00:00:32.309> good<00:00:32.640> thing<00:00:32.820> about<00:00:32.910> this

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:33.270 
this glass jar the good thing about this

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:35.840 
this glass jar the good thing about this
is<00:00:33.570> that<00:00:33.630> the<00:00:34.110> jar<00:00:34.320> is<00:00:34.440> clear<00:00:34.950> so<00:00:35.219> I<00:00:35.250> can<00:00:35.340> see

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:35.850 
is that the jar is clear so I can see

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:38.389 
is that the jar is clear so I can see
exactly<00:00:36.300> what's<00:00:36.750> inside<00:00:36.960> of<00:00:37.200> it<00:00:37.410> however<00:00:38.070> the

00:00:38.389 --> 00:00:38.399 
exactly what's inside of it however the

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:40.880 
exactly what's inside of it however the
bad<00:00:38.579> thing<00:00:38.820> about<00:00:38.940> it<00:00:39.090> is<00:00:39.420> that<00:00:39.870> since<00:00:40.590> it<00:00:40.770> is<00:00:40.829> a

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890 
bad thing about it is that since it is a

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:44.389 
bad thing about it is that since it is a
jar<00:00:41.219> it's<00:00:41.489> really<00:00:41.879> hard<00:00:42.180> to<00:00:42.629> get<00:00:43.440> access<00:00:44.100> to

00:00:44.389 --> 00:00:44.399 
jar it's really hard to get access to

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:49.010 
jar it's really hard to get access to
the<00:00:44.910> brain<00:00:45.090> sits<00:00:45.420> down<00:00:45.690> at<00:00:45.930> the<00:00:45.960> bottom<00:00:46.260> so<00:00:48.020> the

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.020 
the brain sits down at the bottom so the

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:51.290 
the brain sits down at the bottom so the
ones<00:00:49.230> I<00:00:49.410> normally<00:00:49.920> wear<00:00:50.070> are<00:00:50.399> the<00:00:50.940> ones<00:00:51.180> that

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 
ones I normally wear are the ones that

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:53.240 
ones I normally wear are the ones that
are<00:00:51.480> easily<00:00:51.899> attainable<00:00:52.230> or<00:00:52.680> the<00:00:52.980> ones<00:00:53.160> that

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
are easily attainable or the ones that

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:55.220 
are easily attainable or the ones that
are<00:00:53.340> at<00:00:53.820> the<00:00:54.000> very<00:00:54.030> top<00:00:54.329> of<00:00:54.660> the<00:00:54.719> jar<00:00:54.930> and<00:00:55.110> the

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230 
are at the very top of the jar and the

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:56.630 
are at the very top of the jar and the
ones<00:00:55.379> at<00:00:55.530> the<00:00:55.559> bottom<00:00:55.649> aren't<00:00:56.070> doing<00:00:56.280> any<00:00:56.399> love

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
ones at the bottom aren't doing any love

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:58.849 
ones at the bottom aren't doing any love
