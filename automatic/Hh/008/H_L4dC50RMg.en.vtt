00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.700
 Here is such a miracle thing we look 

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:14.490
 sellers denoted as steam 

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:17.960
 gun loud name in general for 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:17.960
 normal funnel 

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:23.609
 brewed 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:24.740
 a quick stainless steel would be one 

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:29.160
 thinner 

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:32.300
 above another thicker below rolling in 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:36.480
 such a spade with holes 

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:38.850
 sellers assure this thing is put in 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:39.980
 Furnaces well, let's say Russians pour le 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:48.030
 president 

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:51.120
 the tube goes deep into the stone and it means 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:55.020
 I pour water here 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:59.010
 heated stones to the depths and you're out 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:01:03.449
 you get my soft fine steam 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:09.659
 That's all as if in words it sounds very 

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:18.350
 not bad swiftly especially when you consider 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:18.350
 that costs as much as 7 thousand here 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:26.520
 In fact, I personally think that all this 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:31.590
 the design warms up to such 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:34.770
 temperatures that through all these 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:37.770
 thin tubes most of the water 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:40.799
 evaporate straight from the top of the funnel all 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:44.640
 the rest will go down the tube and you 

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:48.179
 get the so-called protivohod water 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:52.049
 so hot it goes up and 

00:01:48.179 --> 00:01:54.509
 Here in fact I think that a little stress 

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:55.709
 wigs with stones if at all anything 

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:58.470
 everything evaporates 

00:01:55.709 --> 00:01:59.990
 the pieces of iron will evaporate ie your stones 

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:02.580
 the stove 

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:07.470
 it is generally not clear why it is easier to water 

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:10.890
 Immediately stove than fall asleep stone 

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:12.540
 someone in childhood cheney boiled and water 

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:15.680
 it ended there probably remember 

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:19.500
 I am glad you are running the alternate hot and 

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:22.590
 you put it under the tap here literally 

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:26.060
 the first three seconds the water flows and in 

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:31.620
 teapot doesn't stay here i think 

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:35.340
 the design also warms up to red 

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:39.569
 stoves and water in principle yes stones 

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:42.859
 it will not be reaching in general 

00:02:39.569 --> 00:02:42.859
 and all
