00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:14.160 
long time ago I got this game a long

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:15.770 
long time ago I got this game a long
time<00:00:14.219> ago<00:00:14.730> and<00:00:15.000> it's<00:00:15.179> been<00:00:15.269> sitting<00:00:15.389> around

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:15.780 
time ago and it's been sitting around

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:17.510 
time ago and it's been sitting around
forever<00:00:16.320> because<00:00:16.859> I<00:00:16.890> haven't<00:00:17.100> been<00:00:17.190> able<00:00:17.310> to

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:17.520 
forever because I haven't been able to

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:19.040 
forever because I haven't been able to
figure<00:00:17.670> out<00:00:17.850> what<00:00:18.119> was<00:00:18.300> wrong<00:00:18.330> with<00:00:18.810> it

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:19.050 
figure out what was wrong with it

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:21.560 
figure out what was wrong with it
anytime<00:00:19.740> I'd<00:00:20.070> play<00:00:20.279> any<00:00:20.460> my<00:00:20.580> other<00:00:20.760> STV<00:00:21.300> games

anytime I'd play any my other STV games

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:23.720 
anytime I'd play any my other STV games
they<00:00:21.840> would<00:00:21.960> always<00:00:22.170> play<00:00:22.830> mean<00:00:23.490> with<00:00:23.699> no

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:25.830 
problem in some cases you might get an

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:27.830 
problem in some cases you might get an

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:27.840 
error here and there this is error on

error here and there this is error on
cassette<00:00:28.320> which<00:00:28.949> means<00:00:29.189> that<00:00:29.519> the<00:00:29.760> carts

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:30.060 
cassette which means that the carts

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:31.700 
cassette which means that the carts
probably<00:00:30.449> not<00:00:30.599> clean<00:00:30.960> so<00:00:30.990> you<00:00:31.260> clean<00:00:31.529> it<00:00:31.650> up

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:31.710 
probably not clean so you clean it up

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:34.160 
probably not clean so you clean it up
you<00:00:31.890> put<00:00:32.040> it<00:00:32.130> back<00:00:32.250> in<00:00:32.489> and<00:00:32.850> it<00:00:33.329> works<00:00:33.540> fine<00:00:33.899> I

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:34.170 
you put it back in and it works fine I

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:36.590 
you put it back in and it works fine I
did<00:00:34.559> have<00:00:34.710> one<00:00:35.010> STV<00:00:35.610> board<00:00:35.880> where<00:00:36.120> this<00:00:36.329> deck

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:36.600 
did have one STV board where this deck

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:38.770 
did have one STV board where this deck
over<00:00:36.930> in<00:00:36.989> the<00:00:37.079> corner<00:00:37.410> this<00:00:37.649> chip<00:00:37.920> on<00:00:38.100> top<00:00:38.129> was

00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:38.780 
over in the corner this chip on top was

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:42.170 
over in the corner this chip on top was
actually<00:00:39.780> missing<00:00:40.290> a<00:00:41.219> couple<00:00:41.579> of<00:00:41.790> the<00:00:41.879> legs

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:42.180 
actually missing a couple of the legs

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:44.420 
actually missing a couple of the legs
because<00:00:42.809> over<00:00:43.290> time<00:00:43.500> these<00:00:43.710> boards<00:00:44.040> tend<00:00:44.340> to

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
because over time these boards tend to

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:46.729 
because over time these boards tend to
flex<00:00:44.730> and<00:00:45.030> this<00:00:45.629> corner<00:00:45.930> chip<00:00:46.170> over<00:00:46.500> here

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:46.739 
flex and this corner chip over here

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:48.440 
flex and this corner chip over here
seems<00:00:47.100> to<00:00:47.160> be<00:00:47.309> the<00:00:47.430> worst<00:00:47.610> one<00:00:47.940> what<00:00:48.210> it<00:00:48.300> does

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:48.450 
seems to be the worst one what it does

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:50.330 
seems to be the worst one what it does
is<00:00:48.600> it<00:00:48.719> lifts<00:00:49.020> off<00:00:49.170> the<00:00:49.350> board<00:00:49.590> but<00:00:49.829> I<00:00:50.100> was<00:00:50.219> able

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340 
is it lifts off the board but I was able

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:51.920 
is it lifts off the board but I was able
to<00:00:50.460> fix<00:00:50.730> that<00:00:50.850> on<00:00:51.030> one<00:00:51.180> of<00:00:51.210> my<00:00:51.360> other<00:00:51.510> boards

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930 
to fix that on one of my other boards

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:54.560 
to fix that on one of my other boards
and<00:00:52.170> I<00:00:52.860> got<00:00:53.070> it<00:00:53.190> to<00:00:53.309> work<00:00:53.340> in<00:00:53.969> other<00:00:54.149> cases<00:00:54.390> you

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:54.570 
and I got it to work in other cases you

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:58.459 
and I got it to work in other cases you
might<00:00:54.840> have<00:00:55.110> the<00:00:56.210> the<00:00:57.210> BIOS<00:00:57.539> itself<00:00:58.020> might

00:00:58.459 --> 00:00:58.469 
might have the the BIOS itself might

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:01.490 
might have the the BIOS itself might
come<00:00:58.710> up<00:00:58.859> with<00:00:59.129> wrong<00:00:59.789> BIOS<00:01:00.300> and<00:01:00.660> you<00:01:01.199> have<00:01:01.350> to

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
come up with wrong BIOS and you have to

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:02.840 
come up with wrong BIOS and you have to
change<00:01:01.710> around<00:01:01.859> the<00:01:01.980> BIOS<00:01:02.309> in<00:01:02.489> order<00:01:02.640> to<00:01:02.730> get

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
change around the BIOS in order to get

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:04.579 
change around the BIOS in order to get
the<00:01:02.940> games<00:01:03.120> to<00:01:03.300> work<00:01:03.420> but<00:01:03.750> I<00:01:03.960> tried<00:01:04.409> many

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
the games to work but I tried many

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:06.500 
the games to work but I tried many
different<00:01:04.769> things<00:01:05.070> with<00:01:05.309> this<00:01:05.489> funky<00:01:06.360> head

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:06.510 
different things with this funky head

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:08.539 
different things with this funky head
boxers<00:01:07.020> and<00:01:07.200> was<00:01:07.350> not<00:01:07.530> able<00:01:07.770> to<00:01:07.920> get<00:01:08.100> anywhere

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549 
boxers and was not able to get anywhere

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:10.250 
boxers and was not able to get anywhere
on<00:01:08.760> it<00:01:08.939> and<00:01:09.210> today<00:01:09.570> I<00:01:09.689> thought<00:01:09.960> I'd<00:01:10.110> mess

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260 
on it and today I thought I'd mess

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:12.679 
on it and today I thought I'd mess
around<00:01:10.409> with<00:01:10.619> it<00:01:10.680> just<00:01:10.830> a<00:01:11.100> little<00:01:11.220> bit<00:01:11.460> and<00:01:11.880> as

00:01:12.679 --> 00:01:12.689 
around with it just a little bit and as

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:14.620 
around with it just a little bit and as
an<00:01:12.930> example<00:01:13.260> to<00:01:13.590> show<00:01:13.740> you<00:01:13.770> what<00:01:14.070> it<00:01:14.189> would<00:01:14.310> do

00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:14.630 
an example to show you what it would do

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:18.109 
an example to show you what it would do
let's<00:01:15.630> turn<00:01:15.869> this<00:01:15.960> thing<00:01:16.020> on<00:01:16.290> here<00:01:17.090> when<00:01:18.090> I

you know maybe it's just you know some
battery<00:01:40.710> issue<00:01:40.920> or<00:01:41.189> something<00:01:41.400> like<00:01:41.640> that<00:01:41.850> but

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720 
battery issue or something like that but

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:45.289 
battery issue or something like that but
this<00:01:43.530> is<00:01:43.590> not<00:01:44.040> a<00:01:44.070> it<00:01:44.579> was<00:01:44.790> not<00:01:44.970> a<00:01:45.000> battery

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:45.299 
this is not a it was not a battery

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:47.330 
this is not a it was not a battery
related<00:01:45.930> issue<00:01:46.079> is<00:01:46.320> actually<00:01:46.680> much<00:01:46.860> much<00:01:47.070> more

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340 
related issue is actually much much more

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:49.340 
related issue is actually much much more

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:02.160 
installation whatever so I went into the

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:06.060 
installation whatever so I went into the
the<00:02:03.160> BIOS<00:02:03.520> here<00:02:03.880> and<00:02:04.080> I<00:02:05.080> went<00:02:05.350> down<00:02:05.530> to<00:02:05.560> the

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:44.860 
out of here and now you'll see funky had

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:47.430 
out of here and now you'll see funky had
boxes<00:02:45.280> appears<00:02:45.760> now<00:02:46.450> when<00:02:46.750> you<00:02:46.840> go<00:02:46.960> into<00:02:47.080> funky

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:47.440 
boxes appears now when you go into funky

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:50.010 
boxes appears now when you go into funky
head<00:02:47.560> boxers<00:02:48.010> to<00:02:48.250> check<00:02:48.460> the<00:02:48.610> game<00:02:48.820> and<00:02:49.150> you

head boxers to check the game and you

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:51.330 
head boxers to check the game and you
want<00:02:50.140> to<00:02:50.200> check<00:02:50.320> the<00:02:50.500> game<00:02:50.650> assignments

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:51.340 
want to check the game assignments

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:53.640 
want to check the game assignments
you'll<00:02:51.970> notice<00:02:52.360> that<00:02:52.570> it<00:02:52.720> says<00:02:52.870> communication

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:53.650 
you'll notice that it says communication

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:57.810 
you'll notice that it says communication
it<00:02:53.950> has<00:02:53.980> off<00:02:54.910> it<00:02:55.570> also<00:02:55.750> has<00:02:56.080> ID<00:02:56.620> with<00:02:57.190> master

00:02:57.810 --> 00:02:57.820 
it has off it also has ID with master

00:02:57.820 --> 00:03:01.350 
it has off it also has ID with master
and<00:02:58.030> slave<00:02:58.720> so<00:02:59.650> this<00:03:00.190> is<00:03:00.370> game<00:03:01.120> that's

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:01.360 
and slave so this is game that's

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:04.110 
and slave so this is game that's
designed<00:03:01.720> for<00:03:02.110> multiple<00:03:03.010> systems<00:03:03.700> to<00:03:04.030> be

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:04.120 
designed for multiple systems to be

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:06.180 
designed for multiple systems to be
hooked<00:03:04.330> up<00:03:04.540> and<00:03:04.870> if<00:03:05.470> it<00:03:05.739> doesn't<00:03:06.040> have

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:06.190 
hooked up and if it doesn't have

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:07.920 
hooked up and if it doesn't have
multiple<00:03:06.610> systems<00:03:06.970> hooked<00:03:07.209> up<00:03:07.390> and<00:03:07.630> it's<00:03:07.690> not

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:07.930 
multiple systems hooked up and it's not

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:11.670 
multiple systems hooked up and it's not
on<00:03:08.110> one<00:03:08.440> cab<00:03:08.739> only<00:03:09.330> it<00:03:10.330> won't<00:03:10.510> fire<00:03:10.720> up<00:03:10.959> so

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:11.680 
on one cab only it won't fire up so

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:14.610 
on one cab only it won't fire up so
something<00:03:12.340> really<00:03:12.730> really<00:03:12.970> simple<00:03:13.360> but<00:03:13.959> it

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:14.620 
something really really simple but it

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:16.199 
something really really simple but it
was<00:03:14.800> something<00:03:15.010> that<00:03:15.040> you<00:03:15.730> know<00:03:15.820> it<00:03:15.910> took<00:03:16.030> me<00:03:16.090> a

00:03:16.199 --> 00:03:16.209 
was something that you know it took me a

00:03:16.209 --> 00:03:18.570 
was something that you know it took me a
while<00:03:16.420> to<00:03:16.480> get<00:03:16.870> you<00:03:17.830> know<00:03:17.920> right<00:03:18.160> because<00:03:18.459> it

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:18.580 
while to get you know right because it

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:19.890 
while to get you know right because it
doesn't<00:03:18.820> tell<00:03:18.970> you<00:03:19.090> exactly<00:03:19.120> what's<00:03:19.660> wrong

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:19.900 
doesn't tell you exactly what's wrong

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:21.630 
doesn't tell you exactly what's wrong
with<00:03:20.110> it<00:03:20.290> it<00:03:20.709> just<00:03:20.980> says<00:03:21.130> you<00:03:21.160> know<00:03:21.370> go<00:03:21.489> into

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:21.640 
with it it just says you know go into

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:23.280 
with it it just says you know go into
system<00:03:21.940> assignments<00:03:22.480> and<00:03:22.660> you're<00:03:22.989> thinking

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:23.290 
system assignments and you're thinking

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:26.130 
system assignments and you're thinking
all<00:03:23.380> right<00:03:23.590> okay<00:03:24.160> well<00:03:24.580> one<00:03:24.940> yeah<00:03:25.480> I<00:03:25.540> guess<00:03:25.840> one

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:26.140 
all right okay well one yeah I guess one

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:29.009 
all right okay well one yeah I guess one
player<00:03:26.530> cabinet<00:03:27.250> type<00:03:27.459> yeah<00:03:27.910> that's<00:03:28.510> kind<00:03:28.959> of

00:03:29.009 --> 00:03:29.019 
player cabinet type yeah that's kind of

00:03:29.019 --> 00:03:32.850 
player cabinet type yeah that's kind of
weird<00:03:29.200> but<00:03:29.880> that<00:03:30.880> does<00:03:31.420> the<00:03:31.600> trick<00:03:31.870> so<00:03:32.350> get<00:03:32.739> out

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:32.860 
weird but that does the trick so get out

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:35.460 
weird but that does the trick so get out
of<00:03:32.890> here<00:03:33.160> and<00:03:33.510> go<00:03:34.510> down<00:03:34.660> to<00:03:34.690> the<00:03:34.930> exit<00:03:35.290> and

00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:35.470 
of here and go down to the exit and

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:38.130 
of here and go down to the exit and
you'll<00:03:36.370> notice<00:03:36.550> up<00:03:36.760> here<00:03:36.790> it<00:03:37.180> says<00:03:37.209> funky<00:03:38.019> head

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:38.140 
you'll notice up here it says funky head

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:40.050 
you'll notice up here it says funky head
boxes<00:03:38.560> and<00:03:38.739> it<00:03:38.830> says<00:03:38.980> it's<00:03:39.190> produced<00:03:39.519> by<00:03:39.610> Sega

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:40.060 
boxes and it says it's produced by Sega

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:43.410 
boxes and it says it's produced by Sega
and<00:03:40.600> it'll<00:03:41.019> fire<00:03:41.200> right<00:03:41.440> up<00:03:41.470> so<00:03:42.420> something

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:43.420 
and it'll fire right up so something

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:45.780 
and it'll fire right up so something
that's<00:03:43.450> simple<00:03:44.080> it<00:03:45.040> took<00:03:45.280> me<00:03:45.430> a<00:03:45.459> little<00:03:45.640> while

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:45.790 
that's simple it took me a little while

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:47.790 
that's simple it took me a little while
to<00:03:45.910> figure<00:03:46.209> out<00:03:46.480> I<00:03:46.720> gave<00:03:47.110> up<00:03:47.410> on<00:03:47.530> it<00:03:47.709> a<00:03:47.769> couple

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:47.800 
to figure out I gave up on it a couple

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:48.900 
to figure out I gave up on it a couple
of<00:03:48.070> times<00:03:48.280> you<00:03:48.400> know<00:03:48.489> when<00:03:48.580> I<00:03:48.670> was<00:03:48.790> messing

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:48.910 
of times you know when I was messing

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:50.040 
of times you know when I was messing
around<00:03:49.120> with<00:03:49.300> it<00:03:49.360> thought<00:03:49.630> it<00:03:49.720> was<00:03:49.810> something

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:50.050 
around with it thought it was something

00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:51.810 
around with it thought it was something
that<00:03:50.080> was<00:03:50.350> a<00:03:50.380> little<00:03:50.769> bit<00:03:50.890> more<00:03:51.100> tricky<00:03:51.430> than

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:51.820 
that was a little bit more tricky than

00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:55.890 
that was a little bit more tricky than
what<00:03:52.030> it<00:03:52.120> actually<00:03:52.150> was<00:03:53.250> but<00:03:54.660> really<00:03:55.660> really

00:03:55.890 --> 00:03:55.900 
what it actually was but really really

00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:59.400 
what it actually was but really really
simple<00:03:56.260> thing<00:03:56.470> and<00:03:57.840> that<00:03:58.840> got<00:03:58.989> this<00:03:59.110> thing<00:03:59.320> to

00:03:59.400 --> 00:03:59.410 
simple thing and that got this thing to

00:03:59.410 --> 00:04:02.910 
simple thing and that got this thing to
work<00:03:59.590> so<00:04:00.420> hopefully<00:04:01.420> here<00:04:01.720> no<00:04:02.560> no<00:04:02.709> maybe

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:02.920 
work so hopefully here no no maybe

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:05.100 
work so hopefully here no no maybe

some<00:04:05.830> gameplay<00:04:06.280> here<00:04:06.550> on<00:04:06.670> funky<00:04:07.060> head<00:04:07.180> boxers

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:07.600 
some gameplay here on funky head boxers

00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:09.270 
some gameplay here on funky head boxers
if<00:04:07.780> everything<00:04:08.140> works<00:04:08.350> out<00:04:08.500> all<00:04:08.680> right

if everything works out all right
I'll<00:04:09.490> give<00:04:09.610> it<00:04:09.640> a<00:04:09.730> test<00:04:09.940> through<00:04:10.150> and<00:04:10.270> make

00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:10.390 
I'll give it a test through and make

00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:12.000 
I'll give it a test through and make

if anybody's having a trouble with their
siga<00:04:16.660> STV<00:04:17.290> board<00:04:17.590> I<00:04:17.859> mean<00:04:18.010> it<00:04:18.160> could<00:04:18.280> be<00:04:18.310> a

00:04:18.420 --> 00:04:18.430 
siga STV board I mean it could be a

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:20.099 
siga STV board I mean it could be a
number<00:04:19.150> of<00:04:19.269> different<00:04:19.570> things<00:04:19.720> on<00:04:19.959> these

00:04:20.099 --> 00:04:20.109 
number of different things on these

00:04:20.109 --> 00:04:21.539 
number of different things on these
things<00:04:20.350> like<00:04:20.500> I<00:04:20.590> said<00:04:20.799> it<00:04:20.890> could<00:04:21.040> be<00:04:21.130> the<00:04:21.250> BIOS

00:04:21.539 --> 00:04:21.549 
things like I said it could be the BIOS

00:04:21.549 --> 00:04:23.910 
things like I said it could be the BIOS
is<00:04:21.760> not<00:04:21.940> correct<00:04:22.330> for<00:04:22.570> the<00:04:23.020> certain<00:04:23.650> cart

00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:23.920 
is not correct for the certain cart

00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:25.710 
is not correct for the certain cart
that's<00:04:24.100> in<00:04:24.310> there<00:04:24.490> it<00:04:25.030> could<00:04:25.210> be<00:04:25.270> this<00:04:25.510> chip

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:25.720 
that's in there it could be this chip

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:28.350 
that's in there it could be this chip
over<00:04:25.900> in<00:04:26.050> the<00:04:26.110> corner<00:04:26.440> lifted<00:04:27.220> off<00:04:27.370> of<00:04:27.400> its

00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:28.360 
over in the corner lifted off of its

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:31.920 
over in the corner lifted off of its
posts<00:04:28.800> it<00:04:29.800> could<00:04:30.100> be<00:04:30.280> you<00:04:30.970> know<00:04:31.000> one<00:04:31.750> of<00:04:31.780> these

00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:31.930 
posts it could be you know one of these

00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:34.650 
posts it could be you know one of these
jumpers<00:04:32.350> this<00:04:32.680> jumper<00:04:33.580> could<00:04:33.760> be<00:04:33.910> off<00:04:34.210> in<00:04:34.570> the

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:34.660 
jumpers this jumper could be off in the

00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:36.720 
jumpers this jumper could be off in the
wrong<00:04:34.810> spot<00:04:35.230> it<00:04:35.770> could<00:04:36.280> be<00:04:36.370> a<00:04:36.400> number<00:04:36.610> of

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:36.730 
wrong spot it could be a number of

00:04:36.730 --> 00:04:38.100 
wrong spot it could be a number of
different<00:04:36.820> things<00:04:37.240> but<00:04:37.420> in<00:04:37.510> this<00:04:37.600> case<00:04:37.810> here

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:38.110 
different things but in this case here

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:41.070 
different things but in this case here
was<00:04:38.290> just<00:04:38.500> something<00:04:38.740> simple<00:04:39.130> so<00:04:39.460> I<00:04:40.080> also

00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:41.080 
was just something simple so I also

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:43.430 
was just something simple so I also
replace<00:04:41.380> that<00:04:41.500> super<00:04:41.800> capacitor<00:04:42.310> that<00:04:42.460> was

00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:43.440 
replace that super capacitor that was

00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:46.170 
replace that super capacitor that was
kind<00:04:44.440> of<00:04:44.500> really<00:04:44.890> rotten<00:04:45.340> so<00:04:45.730> that's<00:04:45.970> got<00:04:46.150> a

00:04:46.170 --> 00:04:46.180 
kind of really rotten so that's got a

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:48.060 
kind of really rotten so that's got a
new<00:04:46.330> one<00:04:46.450> in<00:04:46.570> there<00:04:46.720> it's<00:04:47.290> all<00:04:47.470> ready<00:04:47.740> to<00:04:47.830> go

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:48.070 
new one in there it's all ready to go

00:04:48.070 --> 00:04:50.970 
new one in there it's all ready to go
but<00:04:48.700> I'll<00:04:49.660> hopefully<00:04:50.290> be<00:04:50.470> able<00:04:50.650> to<00:04:50.770> put<00:04:50.950> up

00:04:50.970 --> 00:04:50.980 
but I'll hopefully be able to put up

00:04:50.980 --> 00:04:52.560 
but I'll hopefully be able to put up
some<00:04:51.220> video<00:04:51.490> on<00:04:51.550> this<00:04:51.910> thing<00:04:52.120> here<00:04:52.390> tomorrow
