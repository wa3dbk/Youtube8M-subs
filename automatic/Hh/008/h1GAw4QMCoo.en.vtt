 problems the planes don't fly like that 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:51.690
 waddling aboard 

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:53.670
 most likely the liner refused one of 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:55.770
 elevators carcass periodically 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:57.930
 falls on the left wing but adding

 on the engine thrust pilot time after time 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:01.829

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:03.750
 everyone understands the earth is taking shape 

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:10.110
 abnormal situation if not to say 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:13.260
 more catastrophic Tu-154b 2 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:16.409

 Chkalovsk airfield near Moscow on 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:31.170
 some data on April 29th the crew under 

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:33.030
 the command of yuri rodionova was supposed to 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:33.540
 overtake aircraft samara repair 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:35.220
 factory 

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:37.799
 but the flight lasted just over ten minutes 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:39.750
 at the lowest possible height having understood that 

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:41.810
 the liner does not actually manage the crew 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:43.640
 decides to plant it 

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:47.829
 you have you greatly complicates rising 

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:47.829
 the wind and the carcass chattering in three planes 

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:52.640
 the pilot enters the first lap though with 

00:01:51.049 --> 00:01:54.560
 parties it seems that the plane is just 

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:56.450
 falls climbed hiding behind the trees 

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:58.820
 in a minute the liner reappears in 

00:01:56.450 --> 00:02:01.159
 the sky the pilots missed the take-off 

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:02.630
 landing strip and starting a new approach 

00:02:01.159 --> 00:02:05.960
 which ends up 

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:07.789
 well on the video is not visible moment 

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:09.170
 landing but the fact that she was tough 

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:10.849
 can be judged by the photos taken 

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:12.890
 hundreds of meters from the landing site 

00:02:10.849 --> 00:02:14.870
 touching the asphalt from under the highway 

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:17.180
 carcass smoke pulls several times 

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:20.200
 bounces around and already slowing down calmly 

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:20.200
 rolling out from behind the forest
