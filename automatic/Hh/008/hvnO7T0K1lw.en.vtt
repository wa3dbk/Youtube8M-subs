just got thrown on the run first time I

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:06.710 
just got thrown on the run first time I
ran<00:00:04.680> it<00:00:04.859> a<00:00:04.920> long<00:00:05.100> time<00:00:05.370> feel<00:00:05.970> sad<00:00:06.210> to<00:00:06.359> say<00:00:06.509> that

00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:06.720 
ran it a long time feel sad to say that

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:08.810 
ran it a long time feel sad to say that
but<00:00:06.930> it's<00:00:07.589> the<00:00:07.770> truth<00:00:07.980> that<00:00:08.010> I<00:00:08.280> haven't<00:00:08.550> really

00:00:08.810 --> 00:00:08.820 
but it's the truth that I haven't really

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:10.520 
but it's the truth that I haven't really
been<00:00:08.849> doing<00:00:09.090> cardio<00:00:09.540> as<00:00:09.660> much<00:00:09.809> as<00:00:09.929> I<00:00:10.050> should

00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:10.530 
been doing cardio as much as I should

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:12.680 
been doing cardio as much as I should
I<00:00:10.559> am<00:00:11.099> bulky<00:00:11.490> now<00:00:11.670> and<00:00:11.849> I<00:00:11.910> just<00:00:11.940> realized<00:00:12.269> that

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:12.690 
I am bulky now and I just realized that

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:14.180 
I am bulky now and I just realized that
this<00:00:12.840> is<00:00:12.990> the<00:00:13.080> first<00:00:13.259> time<00:00:13.559> I'm<00:00:13.889> doing<00:00:13.920> a

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:14.190 
this is the first time I'm doing a

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:16.820 
this is the first time I'm doing a
bulking<00:00:14.580> update<00:00:15.030> fit<00:00:15.210> at<00:00:15.360> all<00:00:15.450> so<00:00:15.809> I<00:00:16.170> thought<00:00:16.800> I

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:16.830 
bulking update fit at all so I thought I

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:19.760 
bulking update fit at all so I thought I
was<00:00:17.100> due<00:00:17.279> for<00:00:17.520> one<00:00:17.699> and<00:00:18.000> so<00:00:18.630> as<00:00:19.260> you<00:00:19.470> can<00:00:19.529> see

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:19.770 
was due for one and so as you can see

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:23.000 
was due for one and so as you can see
just<00:00:20.039> real<00:00:20.279> quickly<00:00:21.109> the<00:00:22.109> ABS<00:00:22.320> are<00:00:22.590> pretty

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:23.010 
just real quickly the ABS are pretty

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:24.830 
just real quickly the ABS are pretty
much<00:00:23.130> non-existent<00:00:23.400> got<00:00:24.150> a<00:00:24.180> little<00:00:24.449> fat<00:00:24.630> going

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:24.840 
much non-existent got a little fat going

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:27.589 
much non-existent got a little fat going
there<00:00:25.140> now<00:00:25.350> but<00:00:25.619> yeah<00:00:26.609> and<00:00:26.880> that's<00:00:27.090> basically

00:00:27.589 --> 00:00:27.599 
there now but yeah and that's basically

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:30.109 
there now but yeah and that's basically
you<00:00:28.320> gotta<00:00:28.680> expect<00:00:29.039> that<00:00:29.250> during<00:00:29.550> a<00:00:29.640> bulk<00:00:29.849> if

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:30.119 
you gotta expect that during a bulk if

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:31.820 
you gotta expect that during a bulk if
you're<00:00:30.359> gonna<00:00:30.449> build<00:00:30.720> any<00:00:30.929> muscle<00:00:31.289> at<00:00:31.380> all<00:00:31.529> I

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:31.830 
you're gonna build any muscle at all I

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:34.549 
you're gonna build any muscle at all I
mean<00:00:32.040> you<00:00:32.790> can't<00:00:33.120> really<00:00:33.540> find<00:00:33.840> that<00:00:33.989> exact

00:00:34.549 --> 00:00:34.559 
mean you can't really find that exact

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:36.440 
mean you can't really find that exact
window<00:00:34.800> of<00:00:35.040> only<00:00:35.309> muscle<00:00:35.550> building<00:00:36.000> and<00:00:36.239> no

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:36.450 
window of only muscle building and no

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:38.209 
window of only muscle building and no
fat<00:00:36.719> game<00:00:36.960> it's<00:00:37.200> really<00:00:37.260> tough<00:00:37.770> thing<00:00:37.980> to<00:00:38.010> do

00:00:38.209 --> 00:00:38.219 
fat game it's really tough thing to do

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:39.560 
fat game it's really tough thing to do
if<00:00:38.399> you're<00:00:38.520> able<00:00:38.640> to<00:00:38.850> figure<00:00:39.030> it<00:00:39.210> out<00:00:39.270> for<00:00:39.329> your

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.570 
if you're able to figure it out for your

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:42.709 
if you're able to figure it out for your
body<00:00:39.809> thing<00:00:40.200> kudos<00:00:41.010> to<00:00:41.160> you<00:00:41.280> but<00:00:41.579> for<00:00:42.239> me<00:00:42.329> when

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:42.719 
body thing kudos to you but for me when

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:44.450 
body thing kudos to you but for me when
I<00:00:42.780> bothe<00:00:43.020> him<00:00:43.230> I<00:00:43.410> know<00:00:43.469> that<00:00:43.920> I'm<00:00:44.100> gonna<00:00:44.190> put<00:00:44.430> on

I bothe him I know that I'm gonna put on

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:46.790 
I bothe him I know that I'm gonna put on
a<00:00:44.550> little<00:00:44.850> fat<00:00:45.030> but<00:00:45.329> I'm<00:00:46.020> trying<00:00:46.320> to<00:00:46.350> remain

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
a little fat but I'm trying to remain

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:49.040 
a little fat but I'm trying to remain
somewhat<00:00:47.670> lean<00:00:47.940> I'm<00:00:48.180> happy<00:00:48.539> that<00:00:48.570> you<00:00:48.899> know<00:00:48.930> I

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.050 
somewhat lean I'm happy that you know I

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:51.020 
somewhat lean I'm happy that you know I
can<00:00:49.289> somewhat<00:00:49.829> see<00:00:49.860> my<00:00:50.190> app<00:00:50.340> still<00:00:50.670> I'm<00:00:51.000> not

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030 
can somewhat see my app still I'm not

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:53.660 
can somewhat see my app still I'm not
just<00:00:51.480> like<00:00:51.660> sporting<00:00:52.649> 2k<00:00:52.920> or<00:00:53.129> anything<00:00:53.430> like

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
just like sporting 2k or anything like

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:57.200 
just like sporting 2k or anything like
that<00:00:53.699> but<00:00:54.440> ultimately<00:00:55.440> I<00:00:56.219> mean<00:00:56.699> it's<00:00:56.969> kind<00:00:57.180> of

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
that but ultimately I mean it's kind of

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:58.490 
that but ultimately I mean it's kind of
hard<00:00:57.420> to<00:00:57.449> tell

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
hard to tell

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:00.889 
hard to tell
size-wise<00:00:59.129> at<00:00:59.789> this<00:00:59.969> point<00:01:00.239> I<00:01:00.359> mean<00:01:00.510> really

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899 
size-wise at this point I mean really

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:02.680 
size-wise at this point I mean really
it's<00:01:01.020> been<00:01:01.140> about<00:01:01.410> like<00:01:01.469> a<00:01:01.649> month<00:01:01.920> or<00:01:02.129> two<00:01:02.309> and

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:02.690 
it's been about like a month or two and

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:05.090 
it's been about like a month or two and
according<00:01:03.690> to<00:01:03.809> the<00:01:03.930> scale<00:01:04.170> yeah<00:01:04.619> I<00:01:04.650> put<00:01:05.010> on

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
according to the scale yeah I put on

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:08.240 
according to the scale yeah I put on
muscle<00:01:05.309> and<00:01:05.760> I<00:01:06.330> definitely<00:01:07.110> feel<00:01:07.350> overall

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
muscle and I definitely feel overall

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:10.510 
muscle and I definitely feel overall
fuller<00:01:08.700> than<00:01:09.210> I<00:01:09.390> was<00:01:09.600> when<00:01:09.720> I<00:01:09.780> was<00:01:09.960> on<00:01:10.049> a<00:01:10.080> cut

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:10.520 
fuller than I was when I was on a cut

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:14.090 
fuller than I was when I was on a cut
but<00:01:12.080> ultimately<00:01:13.080> I'm<00:01:13.619> happy<00:01:13.890> with<00:01:13.979> my

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
but ultimately I'm happy with my

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:15.590 
but ultimately I'm happy with my
progress<00:01:14.340> but<00:01:14.670> I'm<00:01:14.760> more<00:01:15.000> than<00:01:15.360> seeing

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
progress but I'm more than seeing

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:18.350 
progress but I'm more than seeing
strength<00:01:16.170> gains<00:01:16.580> compared<00:01:17.580> to<00:01:17.790> actual

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
strength gains compared to actual

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:20.450 
strength gains compared to actual
noticing<00:01:19.049> of<00:01:19.170> like<00:01:19.350> any<00:01:19.560> like<00:01:19.860> size<00:01:20.130> or

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 
noticing of like any like size or

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:21.109 
noticing of like any like size or
anything<00:01:20.640> like<00:01:20.850> that

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 
anything like that

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:23.530 
anything like that
my<00:01:21.689> arms<00:01:22.020> are<00:01:22.170> I<00:01:22.200> think<00:01:22.439> pretty<00:01:22.619> much<00:01:22.920> the<00:01:23.070> same

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:23.540 
my arms are I think pretty much the same

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:25.999 
my arms are I think pretty much the same
I'm<00:01:24.540> really<00:01:24.990> focusing<00:01:25.320> I'm<00:01:25.470> trying<00:01:25.710> to<00:01:25.770> get<00:01:25.890> my

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:26.009 
I'm really focusing I'm trying to get my

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:27.499 
I'm really focusing I'm trying to get my
chest<00:01:26.280> bigger<00:01:26.549> especially<00:01:26.820> the<00:01:27.240> upper

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:27.509 
chest bigger especially the upper

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:30.109 
chest bigger especially the upper
portions<00:01:27.930> of<00:01:28.250> little<00:01:29.250> boob<00:01:29.610> action<00:01:29.790> right

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:30.119 
portions of little boob action right

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:35.390 
portions of little boob action right
there<00:01:30.150> and<00:01:30.540> as<00:01:30.990> far<00:01:31.140> as<00:01:31.200> my<00:01:31.350> legs<00:01:31.799> go<00:01:31.979> I<00:01:34.400> think

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:35.400 
there and as far as my legs go I think

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:37.700 
there and as far as my legs go I think
they're<00:01:35.759> pretty<00:01:35.970> much<00:01:36.210> looking<00:01:36.869> similar<00:01:37.380> to

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710 
they're pretty much looking similar to

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:39.859 
they're pretty much looking similar to
what<00:01:37.860> they<00:01:38.009> were<00:01:38.240> still<00:01:39.240> can<00:01:39.420> see<00:01:39.570> some

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:39.869 
what they were still can see some

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:42.590 
what they were still can see some
definition<00:01:40.560> but<00:01:41.180> really<00:01:42.180> trying<00:01:42.420> to<00:01:42.479> like

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600 
definition but really trying to like
