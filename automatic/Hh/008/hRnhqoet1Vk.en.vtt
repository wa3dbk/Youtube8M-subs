00:00:09.640 --> 00:00:09.650 

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:22.630 

I'm<00:00:10.650> shaking<00:00:10.890> this<00:00:11.100> board<00:00:11.370> 4<00:00:11.520> 80<00:00:11.640> irons<00:00:12.090> and

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:22.640 

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:27.920 

and<00:00:24.500> this<00:00:25.500> is<00:00:25.740> our<00:00:26.390> you<00:00:27.390> know<00:00:27.510> highest

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:27.930 
and this is our you know highest

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:33.590 
and this is our you know highest
performance<00:00:28.680> short<00:00:29.400> board<00:00:31.489> that<00:00:32.489> we<00:00:32.970> make<00:00:33.180> two

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:33.600

big<00:00:33.900> single<00:00:34.379> concave<00:00:34.910> from<00:00:35.910> from<00:00:36.449> the<00:00:36.540> center

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:36.870 
big single concave from from the center

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:41.240 
big single concave from from the center
of<00:00:36.900> the<00:00:37.020> wars<00:00:37.350> all<00:00:38.220> the<00:00:38.670> way<00:00:38.790> off<00:00:39.030> the<00:00:39.239> tail<00:00:40.250> and

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:41.250 
of the wars all the way off the tail and

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:45.320 
of the wars all the way off the tail and
it's<00:00:41.460> actually<00:00:41.699> a<00:00:42.300> pretty<00:00:42.629> basic<00:00:42.839> board<00:00:44.330> with

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:45.330 
it's actually a pretty basic board with

00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:47.960 
it's actually a pretty basic board with
a<00:00:45.629> little<00:00:45.839> bit<00:00:45.960> of<00:00:46.019> flip<00:00:46.320> in<00:00:46.470> the<00:00:46.500> tail<00:00:46.970> the

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:47.970 
a little bit of flip in the tail the

00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:51.259 
a little bit of flip in the tail the
single<00:00:48.360> concave<00:00:48.570> really<00:00:49.199> fast<00:00:50.059> Finn<00:00:51.059> just

00:00:51.259 --> 00:00:51.269 
single concave really fast Finn just

00:00:51.269 --> 00:00:53.329 
single concave really fast Finn just
pushed<00:00:51.510> up<00:00:51.720> flipping<00:00:52.260> the<00:00:52.350> tail<00:00:52.589> and<00:00:52.800> good

00:00:53.329 --> 00:00:53.339 
pushed up flipping the tail and good

00:00:53.339 --> 00:00:56.570 
pushed up flipping the tail and good
moves<00:00:53.970> loose<00:00:54.540> off<00:00:54.780> the<00:00:54.809> top<00:00:55.280> with<00:00:56.280> lots<00:00:56.460> of

00:00:56.570 --> 00:00:56.580 
moves loose off the top with lots of

00:00:56.580 --> 00:00:59.030 
moves loose off the top with lots of
drive<00:00:56.820> and<00:00:56.850> lots<00:00:57.210> of<00:00:57.330> speed<00:00:57.600> so<00:00:58.530> I'll<00:00:58.860> go<00:00:59.010> ahead

00:00:59.030 --> 00:00:59.040 
drive and lots of speed so I'll go ahead

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:06.160 
drive and lots of speed so I'll go ahead
and<00:00:59.309> try<00:01:00.239> to<00:01:00.360> start<00:01:00.600> shaping<00:01:00.989> a<00:01:01.080> concave<00:01:01.559> in<00:01:01.769> co

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:06.170 

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:09.830 

from<00:01:07.170> the<00:01:07.740> entry<00:01:08.190> of<00:01:08.220> the<00:01:08.369> board<00:01:08.700> out<00:01:09.330> the<00:01:09.600> tail

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
from the entry of the board out the tail

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:14.750 
from the entry of the board out the tail
I<00:01:12.350> said<00:01:13.350> that<00:01:13.500> that<00:01:13.860> makes<00:01:14.070> is<00:01:14.190> really<00:01:14.460> fast

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760 
I said that that makes is really fast

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:18.080 
I said that that makes is really fast
here<00:01:15.860> sometimes<00:01:16.860> its<00:01:17.040> angles<00:01:17.430> and<00:01:17.730> you<00:01:17.820> really

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
here sometimes its angles and you really

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:21.950 
here sometimes its angles and you really
sticky<00:01:18.450> or<00:01:19.050> stiff<00:01:19.790> and<00:01:20.790> this<00:01:21.390> blip<00:01:21.690> in<00:01:21.870> the

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960 
sticky or stiff and this blip in the

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:24.530 
sticky or stiff and this blip in the
tail<00:01:22.200> helps<00:01:22.500> that<00:01:22.830> and<00:01:23.550> also<00:01:23.910> you'll<00:01:24.270> see

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
tail helps that and also you'll see

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:27.200 
tail helps that and also you'll see
after<00:01:24.810> I<00:01:24.840> do<00:01:24.990> this<00:01:25.290> side<00:01:25.560> at<00:01:25.740> the<00:01:25.830> bottom<00:01:26.310> the

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210 
after I do this side at the bottom the

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:30.140 
after I do this side at the bottom the
later<00:01:27.420> the<00:01:27.540> rail<00:01:27.840> is<00:01:28.230> rolled<00:01:28.530> back<00:01:28.890> this<00:01:29.730> tough

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.150 
later the rail is rolled back this tough

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:31.560 
later the rail is rolled back this tough
and<00:01:30.510> round

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:31.570 
and round

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:33.810 
and round
they'll<00:01:31.750> have<00:01:32.740> everything<00:01:33.190> to<00:01:33.280> do<00:01:33.460> with<00:01:33.700> the

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:33.820 
they'll have everything to do with the

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:36.420 
they'll have everything to do with the
board<00:01:34.060> to<00:01:34.240> these<00:01:34.390> terms<00:01:34.830> and<00:01:35.830> how<00:01:36.100> the<00:01:36.159> work

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:36.430 
board to these terms and how the work

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:46.410 
board to these terms and how the work
goes<00:01:36.460> up<00:01:36.909> on<00:01:37.090> rail<00:01:37.360> from<00:01:37.960> rail<00:01:38.170> to<00:01:38.440> rail<00:01:45.420> and

00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:46.420 
goes up on rail from rail to rail and

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:50.790 
goes up on rail from rail to rail and
you<00:01:46.570> can<00:01:46.750> measure<00:01:46.930> your<00:01:48.060> concave<00:01:49.060> i<00:01:49.650> put<00:01:50.650> in<00:01:50.740> a

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:50.800 
you can measure your concave i put in a

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:53.580 
you can measure your concave i put in a
straight<00:01:51.100> edge<00:01:51.280> across<00:01:51.550> it<00:01:52.020> and<00:01:53.020> you<00:01:53.200> can<00:01:53.380> see

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:53.590 
straight edge across it and you can see

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:56.340 
straight edge across it and you can see
you've<00:01:53.800> got<00:01:53.830> concave<00:01:54.520> starting<00:01:55.360> right<00:01:55.540> at<00:01:55.810> the

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:56.350 
you've got concave starting right at the

00:01:56.350 --> 00:01:59.700 
you've got concave starting right at the
entry<00:01:56.860> of<00:01:56.890> the<00:01:57.130> board<00:01:58.229> getting<00:01:59.229> pretty<00:01:59.470> deep

00:01:59.700 --> 00:01:59.710 
entry of the board getting pretty deep

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:02.420 
entry of the board getting pretty deep
almost<00:02:00.490> a<00:02:00.610> quarter<00:02:00.820> inch<00:02:01.150> in<00:02:01.420> the<00:02:01.509> center

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:02.430 
almost a quarter inch in the center

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:05.719 
almost a quarter inch in the center
about<00:02:03.430> a<00:02:03.460> quarter<00:02:03.729> inch<00:02:03.880> between<00:02:04.210> the<00:02:04.479> fins

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:05.729 
about a quarter inch between the fins

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:07.920 
about a quarter inch between the fins
single<00:02:06.729> all<00:02:06.880> the<00:02:07.000> way<00:02:07.119> and<00:02:07.450> it<00:02:07.630> gets<00:02:07.750> pretty

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:07.930 
single all the way and it gets pretty

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:09.949 
single all the way and it gets pretty
flat<00:02:08.350> it<00:02:08.679> just<00:02:08.830> kind<00:02:09.009> of<00:02:09.039> flips<00:02:09.310> off<00:02:09.520> the<00:02:09.729> tail

00:02:09.949 --> 00:02:09.959

of meat out of the deck of the board

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:42.990 
of meat out of the deck of the board
gives<00:02:40.540> the<00:02:40.690> board<00:02:40.900> is<00:02:41.110> flex<00:02:41.640> you<00:02:42.640> don't<00:02:42.850> have

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:43.000 
gives the board is flex you don't have

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:47.520 
gives the board is flex you don't have
so<00:02:43.150> much<00:02:43.269> shown<00:02:43.600> across<00:02:44.110> the<00:02:44.410> deck<00:02:46.049> and<00:02:47.049> then

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:47.530 
so much shown across the deck and then

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:49.380 
so much shown across the deck and then
using<00:02:48.220> a<00:02:48.370> real<00:02:48.549> template<00:02:49.000> I<00:02:49.060> know<00:02:49.120> what

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:49.390 
using a real template I know what

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:52.289 
using a real template I know what
