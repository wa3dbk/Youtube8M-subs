00:00:32.209 --> 00:00:32.219 
waxer goes it was a three-step process

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:34.100 
waxer goes it was a three-step process
and<00:00:32.969> here's<00:00:33.180> step<00:00:33.390> number<00:00:33.540> three<00:00:33.870> no<00:00:34.079> I

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:34.110 
and here's step number three no I

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:36.200 
and here's step number three no I
haven't<00:00:34.590> used<00:00:34.800> it<00:00:34.950> yet<00:00:34.980> will<00:00:35.489> I<00:00:35.520> use<00:00:35.940> it

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:36.210

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:40.340 
haven't used it yet will I use it
probably<00:00:36.989> now<00:00:37.559> I<00:00:37.980> will<00:00:38.280> use<00:00:38.309> it<00:00:38.910> because<00:00:39.350> it's

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350 
probably now I will use it because it's

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:43.549 
probably now I will use it because it's
all<00:00:40.890> natural<00:00:41.520> and<00:00:42.270> it's<00:00:42.390> really<00:00:42.870> land<00:00:43.170> with

00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:43.559 
all natural and it's really land with

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:46.340 
all natural and it's really land with
the<00:00:43.860> hair<00:00:44.100> clay<00:00:44.489> and<00:00:44.820> a<00:00:44.879> lot<00:00:45.030> of<00:00:45.059> herbs<00:00:45.450> so<00:00:46.320> I

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350 
the hair clay and a lot of herbs so I

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:50.119 
the hair clay and a lot of herbs so I
will<00:00:46.860> probably<00:00:47.039> use<00:00:47.309> this<00:00:48.649> and<00:00:49.649> one<00:00:49.890> of<00:00:49.920> those

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129 
will probably use this and one of those

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:51.590 
will probably use this and one of those
times<00:00:50.460> where<00:00:50.730> I<00:00:50.760> really<00:00:51.059> want<00:00:51.270> to<00:00:51.329> kind<00:00:51.480> of

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600 
times where I really want to kind of

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:53.779 
times where I really want to kind of
just<00:00:51.870> baby<00:00:52.440> my<00:00:52.680> scalp<00:00:53.100> and<00:00:53.370> just<00:00:53.550> kind<00:00:53.730> of

00:00:53.779 --> 00:00:53.789 
just baby my scalp and just kind of

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:56.060 
just baby my scalp and just kind of

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
cleanse it and you know kind of make it

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:58.490 
cleanse it and you know kind of make it
feel<00:00:56.280> good<00:00:56.690> that's<00:00:57.690> when<00:00:57.930> I'll<00:00:58.020> probably<00:00:58.260> use

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
feel good that's when I'll probably use

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:00.650 
feel good that's when I'll probably use
this<00:00:58.859> because<00:00:59.640> you<00:00:59.760> mix<00:00:59.969> this<00:01:00.180> with<00:01:00.420> rose

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
this because you mix this with rose

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:03.349 
this because you mix this with rose
water<00:01:01.430> and<00:01:02.430> it<00:01:02.609> was<00:01:02.670> okay

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359 
water and it was okay

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:05.030 
water and it was okay

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040 
did it straight my hair no and I don't

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:06.560 
did it straight my hair no and I don't
think<00:01:05.250> that<00:01:05.460> it's<00:01:05.670> meant<00:01:05.909> to<00:01:06.000> straighten<00:01:06.510> your

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
think that it's meant to straighten your

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:08.630 
think that it's meant to straighten your
hair<00:01:06.630> as<00:01:06.990> a<00:01:07.380> relaxer<00:01:08.040> would<00:01:08.220> straighten<00:01:08.549> your

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
hair as a relaxer would straighten your

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:10.670 
hair as a relaxer would straighten your
hair<00:01:08.700> but<00:01:09.570> I<00:01:09.600> have<00:01:09.900> heard<00:01:10.200> from<00:01:10.380> some

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680

youtubers<00:01:11.250> that<00:01:11.310> have<00:01:11.850> you<00:01:12.150> that<00:01:12.450> that<00:01:12.630> when

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
youtubers that have you that that when

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:16.370 
youtubers that have you that that when
they<00:01:12.960> didn't<00:01:13.380> then<00:01:13.590> try<00:01:14.070> to<00:01:14.900> flat<00:01:15.900> iron<00:01:15.930> their

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380 
they didn't then try to flat iron their

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:18.859 
they didn't then try to flat iron their
hair<00:01:16.619> it<00:01:16.799> came<00:01:16.979> out<00:01:17.130> beautifully<00:01:17.670> so<00:01:17.970> maybe

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869 
hair it came out beautifully so maybe

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:21.080 
hair it came out beautifully so maybe
this<00:01:19.229> is<00:01:19.439> a<00:01:19.470> product<00:01:19.920> that<00:01:19.979> someone<00:01:20.400> who<00:01:20.850> has

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090

longer natural hair who wants to kind of
Flatiron<00:01:25.979> it<00:01:26.189> maybe<00:01:26.700> that's<00:01:26.970> a<00:01:27.090> product<00:01:27.390> that

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:27.479 
Flatiron it maybe that's a product that

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:30.080 
Flatiron it maybe that's a product that
would<00:01:27.689> actually<00:01:28.110> work<00:01:28.140> for<00:01:28.619> them<00:01:28.909> but<00:01:29.909> that's

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
would actually work for them but that's

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:32.179 
would actually work for them but that's
not<00:01:30.360> what<00:01:30.570> I<00:01:30.600> was<00:01:30.780> trying<00:01:30.930> to<00:01:31.140> accomplish<00:01:31.350> my

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:32.189 
not what I was trying to accomplish my

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:37.460 
not what I was trying to accomplish my
initial<00:01:35.360> reason<00:01:36.360> for<00:01:36.600> trying<00:01:36.840> that<00:01:37.049> product

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:37.470 
initial reason for trying that product

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:41.030 
initial reason for trying that product
is<00:01:37.560> because<00:01:37.710> I<00:01:38.189> am<00:01:39.150> was<00:01:39.900> very<00:01:40.409> tender<00:01:40.740> headed

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:41.040 
is because I am was very tender headed

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:43.550 
is because I am was very tender headed
and<00:01:41.400> I<00:01:41.759> was<00:01:41.939> so<00:01:42.180> afraid<00:01:42.329> that<00:01:42.780> my<00:01:42.899> natural<00:01:43.079> coil

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560 
and I was so afraid that my natural coil

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:45.530 
and I was so afraid that my natural coil
would<00:01:44.399> actually<00:01:44.670> begin<00:01:44.909> to<00:01:44.939> cause<00:01:45.149> me<00:01:45.329> pain

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:45.540 
would actually begin to cause me pain

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:47.510 
would actually begin to cause me pain
and<00:01:45.930> if<00:01:46.229> it<00:01:46.380> had<00:01:46.530> ever<00:01:46.680> comes<00:01:46.950> that<00:01:47.070> point<00:01:47.280> that

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
and if it had ever comes that point that

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:49.069 
and if it had ever comes that point that
I<00:01:47.610> probably<00:01:47.820> would<00:01:48.149> have<00:01:48.180> never<00:01:48.329> gone<00:01:48.600> natural

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:49.079 
I probably would have never gone natural

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:51.590 
I probably would have never gone natural
however<00:01:49.770> what<00:01:50.189> I<00:01:50.220> realized<00:01:50.729> is<00:01:50.939> the<00:01:51.060> secret

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600 
however what I realized is the secret

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:54.289 
however what I realized is the secret
for<00:01:51.799> not<00:01:52.799> being<00:01:53.130> tender-headed<00:01:53.579> was<00:01:53.909> to<00:01:54.090> make

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:54.299 
for not being tender-headed was to make

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:57.620 
for not being tender-headed was to make
sure<00:01:54.329> that<00:01:55.020> your<00:01:55.740> hair<00:01:56.009> was<00:01:56.460> moisturized<00:01:57.329> and

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:57.630 
sure that your hair was moisturized and

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:00.859 
sure that your hair was moisturized and
had<00:01:58.049> enough<00:01:58.860> moisture<00:01:59.070> in<00:01:59.340> it<00:01:59.520> so<00:02:00.390> that<00:02:00.630> it

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:00.869 
had enough moisture in it so that it

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:02.389 
had enough moisture in it so that it
