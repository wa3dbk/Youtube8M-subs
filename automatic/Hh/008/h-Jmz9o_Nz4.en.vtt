00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:08.500
 The Great Magellanic Cloud (LMC), is a small companion of our Milky Way. 

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:13.300
 It can be seen with the naked eye as a faint, gray spot in the Dorado constellation. 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:20.500
 It is a favorite hunting place for astronomers and has been studied by many telescopes. 

00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:24.000
 Its most spectacular feature is the Tarantula mist, 

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:28.000
 a glowing area of ​​glowing gas and energetic star formation. 

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:31.500
 Hubble was able to take a picture zoomed in on this mist, 

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:35.300
 which reveals the dynamics of this area in our universe for the first time in such detail. 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.500
 Hubblecast Episode 44: Hubble spies on the Tarantula mist. 

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:07.000
 Presented by Dr. J. (aka Dr. Joe Liske) 

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.000
 This part of the Tarantula mist is one of the most dynamic, 

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:16.000
 and show the area around the SuperNova remnant NGC 2060. 

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:23.000
 These wispy shoots of gas and dust are the only visible remains of a star that has exploded. 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.000
 After blowing out these smoky remains 

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:36.300
 the core of the star that formed NGC 2060 collapsed into a pulsar (a type of neutron star). 

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:46.500
 The Tarantula nebula glows so brightly, because the atoms in its hydrogen gas are illuminated by bright, 

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:49.500
 newly born stars that have recently been formed. 

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:55.500
 These baby stars shine with powerful ultra-violet radiation, which ionizes the gas 

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:58.500
 and make it red and green. 

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:04.300
 The light is so intense that - although a 170,000 light years away 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:06.500
 and outside the galaxy - 

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:09.500
 the Tarantula mist on a dark night 

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:12.700
 visible without observers on Earth. 

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:20.000
 But the largest and brightest stars in the Tarantula are actually just outside of Hubble's view. 

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:28.000
 This wider but less detailed image of the Tarantula mist 

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:34.000
 was taken with the MPG / ESO 2.2-meter telescope, at the La Silla observatory, in Chile. 

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:37.500
 It shows us the source that causes a lot of Tarantula's light: 

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:41.000
 the RMC 136 super-star cluster. 

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:51.200
 So, it was not so long ago that astronomers were still debating or 

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:57.500
 this intensive light came from a compact star cluster, or perhaps from an as yet unknown type of superstar. 

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:03.000
 It is only in the last 20 years that we have been able to demonstrate that it is actually a star cluster 

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:07.700
 - although it houses some of the most massive stars ever observed! 

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:14.500
 The Tarantula mist also houses SuperNova 1987a. 

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:18.500
 Of all supernovas that we have observed since the invention of the telescope 

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:23.000
 this is the only one so close to ourselves. 

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:36.500
 As we zoom out, we see the magnitude of the Tarantula nebula clearly contrasting with the galaxy that it houses. 

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:40.500
 It is the largest starry room we know in this region of the universe 

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:44.000
 and one of the most attractive places in the night sky. 

00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:03.000
 Hubblecast is produced by ESA / Hubble, in the European Southern Observatory in Germany. 

00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:07.600
 The Hubble mission is an international collaboration project between NASA and the European Space Agency.

 Now that you know more about Hubble (in space), you can also get up to date with the latest news about the telescopes (on Earth): 

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:33.100
 The 'ESOcast' brings the most interesting to the attention of the European Southern Observatory with its powerful telescopes, which is perched high on the Chilean Andes Mountains; 

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:38.300
 in the southern hemisphere where the best locations are for astronomical observations.
