with two dumbbells be shoulder width
apart<00:03:34.580> little<00:03:35.120> bit<00:03:35.240> of<00:03:35.450> paint<00:03:35.660> we're<00:03:36.290> going<00:03:36.410> to

00:03:36.490 --> 00:03:36.500 
apart little bit of paint we're going to

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:38.740 
apart little bit of paint we're going to
bring<00:03:36.650> our<00:03:36.800> elbows<00:03:37.130> into<00:03:37.370> our<00:03:37.580> side<00:03:37.880> and<00:03:38.450> up

00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:38.750 
bring our elbows into our side and up

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:40.900 
bring our elbows into our side and up
those<00:03:38.900> are<00:03:39.110> a<00:03:39.170> 90<00:03:39.680> degree<00:03:40.010> so<00:03:40.640> where<00:03:40.790> the

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:40.910 
those are a 90 degree so where the

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:42.880 
those are a 90 degree so where the
people<00:03:41.180> I<00:03:41.510> knew<00:03:41.900> creating<00:03:42.320> holes<00:03:42.470> all<00:03:42.740> around

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:42.890 
people I knew creating holes all around

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:45.230 
throughout this entire group first thing

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:46.990 
throughout this entire group first thing
we<00:03:45.350> do<00:03:45.560> is<00:03:45.740> you're<00:03:45.860> going<00:03:46.100> to<00:03:46.160> raise<00:03:46.430> your
