00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:18.560
 once he was adored and he hated 

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:21.410
 inspired horror and respect 

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:23.220
 no light tank could compare to 

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:26.609
 by him 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:30.470
 once gray got to him from those 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:30.470
 no one has seen him 

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:37.320
 hello everyone with you snake and today I 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:39.830
 tell you about the best lt world 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:43.080
 tanks d 52 

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:46.610
 someone first finds out about him and experienced 

00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:49.620
 tankers just remember the old days 

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:52.980
 In the past there were many interesting 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:58.470
 cars but not all have survived to our days 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:01:01.110
 and one of them, our firefly b-52 was 

00:00:58.470 --> 00:01:04.949
 light tanks of the fifth level branches of the USSR 

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:06.270
 he possessed a good 50 7 millimeters 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:11.509
 tool 64 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:13.430
 from the soviet st 5 level t-34 and was 

00:01:11.509 --> 00:01:16.259
 data lt 

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:19.470
 the fastest of all tanks at that time 

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:22.410
 his maximum speed was 72 kilometers per hour 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:26.420
 at that time it was the maximum 

00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:28.950
 speed also he possessed magnificent 

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:32.910
 dynamics and small size 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:36.330
 and therefore a good disguise and he 

00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:38.760
 It was with him at good angles and this 

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:42.150
 understandably meant that he was 

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:46.140
 a lot of ricochets due to everything 

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:49.770
 this he was almost perfect 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:53.760
 little you it here and you can see on 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:56.460
 screen then the strength of the floor is 560 of this 

00:01:53.760 --> 00:02:00.370
 enough to get here tank two or even 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:04.180
 three shots from any of 3 gt 

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:07.510
 the mass was very small but it is not 

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:11.110
 it was his cons yes with the introduction of physics 

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:14.470
 it is very much beginning to bring but it 

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:16.360
 not very bad sometimes with the help of such 

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:18.570
 drifts could be performed on it 

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:21.820
 really circus stunts 

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:24.310
 The review was not the best but with 

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:27.340
 enlightened optics him sweat see 

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:30.150
 their enemies as well for those who do not know 

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:33.310
 earlier from u were thick fifth level 

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:37.830
 that is why it was considered to be complete and 

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:37.830
 cost 700 25,000 earrings 

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:53.190
 now I'll show you the development of the tree 

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:55.590
 this tank 

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:58.080
 he was now speaking on the fifth 

00:02:55.590 --> 00:03:01.530
 level and as you see not so but 

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:03.870
 and the great origins of the tanchik was not even 

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:07.050
 make a bad one even a little slow 

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:10.590
 but in the top and he was awesome 

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:11.550
 this is the most true you tank on which I 

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:15.000
 just played 

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:17.970
 none of the same tank released the same 

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:19.709
 awesome like this and probably never 

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:24.180
 released because well really and 

00:03:19.709 --> 00:03:28.560
 this tank was a unique pity of course 

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:32.069
 that he is no more but still nothing 

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:35.420
 forever as they say and stole it because 

00:03:32.069 --> 00:03:36.540
 what I think was strong 

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:39.180
 balanced 

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:43.920
 but as the official reason was 

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:45.720
 that there simply is not historical 

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:50.069
 that in fact there was not very 

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:54.500
 fast and accompanied the infantry and did not drive 

00:03:50.069 --> 00:03:54.500
 at 72 kilometers per hour nowhere 

00:03:56.640 --> 00:04:12.990
 and in the corner 

00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:13.320
 a lot of telling this 52 because he 

00:04:12.990 --> 00:04:16.310
 was 

00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:21.419
 awesome but now let's talk a 

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:25.140
 these are mine we are now a muffin like us 

00:04:21.419 --> 00:04:26.520
 see our player deal with everyone 

00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:30.419
 program in easy 

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:34.250
 they just who don't see it then not 

00:04:30.419 --> 00:04:37.890
 manages to kill then do not fall because 

00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:39.060
 52g very quickly and as you see it is not 

00:04:37.890 --> 00:04:42.360
 so big 

00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:45.690
 so get it is not so easy and 

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:49.050
 enemies don't always come across good ones 

00:04:45.690 --> 00:04:52.530
 allies and now our d 52 is trying 

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:55.800
 make an important important thing he's trying 

00:04:52.530 --> 00:04:57.000
 knock down the grip because of the type of sergey almost 

00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:59.070
 captured base 

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:02.400
 can he do it let's 

00:04:59.070 --> 00:05:04.080
 let's see maybe not because 

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:07.560
 very little time left but he 

00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:09.930
 knocks he manages to knock and now 

00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:14.130
 trying to somehow move to bring down 

00:05:09.930 --> 00:05:16.770
 again because we allies cannot 

00:05:14.130 --> 00:05:20.310
 no way to deal with type accuracy 

00:05:16.770 --> 00:05:22.669
 used to be not the best this recently 

00:05:20.310 --> 00:05:26.160
 u like recently in simultaneous in 

00:05:22.669 --> 00:05:27.900
 update in my 086 done accuracy 

00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:30.900
 to get more often in the center 

00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:34.259
 earlier accuracy was not very good 

00:05:30.900 --> 00:05:37.860
 3 often to the edge of the circle and here is our hero 

00:05:34.259 --> 00:05:47.789
 still sets you on fire 59 and arson 

00:05:37.860 --> 00:05:51.180
 kills him and now he goes on 

00:05:47.789 --> 00:05:53.039
 notices su-152 and circle that without problems 

00:05:51.180 --> 00:05:57.360
 it does not even have time to wake up 

00:05:53.039 --> 00:06:00.600
 art misses she shoots near and at 

00:05:57.360 --> 00:06:03.740
 we have time to disassemble the drying that our 

00:06:00.600 --> 00:06:03.740
 pie principle does 

00:06:07.009 --> 00:06:12.740
 he makes out her 

00:06:09.380 --> 00:06:12.740
 goes further 

00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:24.150
 what do you want to say 

00:06:19.830 --> 00:06:26.370
 d 52 was a wonderful car on it 

00:06:24.150 --> 00:06:29.470
 many families 

00:06:26.370 --> 00:06:33.610
 some hated him especially from or 

00:06:29.470 --> 00:06:37.180
 for not being killed as his 

00:06:33.610 --> 00:06:39.490
 previously called and moped but still it 

00:06:37.180 --> 00:06:43.930
 he was a great tanchiki he brought a lot 

00:06:39.490 --> 00:06:48.100
 fun and pleasure but in our time 

00:06:43.930 --> 00:06:50.889
 we have funny tanchiki but still 52 

00:06:48.100 --> 00:06:53.979
 I think we will never forget all who 

00:06:50.889 --> 00:06:56.889
 played it well and on this my review 

00:06:53.979 --> 00:06:58.510
 suitable ends like and
