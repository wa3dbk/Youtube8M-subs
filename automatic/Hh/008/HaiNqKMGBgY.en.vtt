00:00:13.690 --> 00:00:19.390
 here, look at me and the company go clever 

00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:21.330
 that quantum 500 is a middle class 

00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:22.950
 smartphone 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:26.510
 You can see from one side here 

00:00:22.950 --> 00:00:30.420
 the white version now company logo and 

00:00:26.510 --> 00:00:30.930
 this will be for 169 euros on the market 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:33.150
 come 

00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:35.340
 always short on the technical data the 

00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:38.550
 have a 5 inch display here 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:42.510
 a cow hd resolution so that's 960 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:45.989
 x 540 pixels closer 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:49.230
 So I recognize so much the pixel 

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:51.269
 So it does not always ade be the 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:54.180
 the price is definitely 

00:00:51.269 --> 00:00:59.430
 acceptable and as processors here 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:01:03.000
 broadcom wcm 23 550 in the arm cortex a7 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:05.309
 quad core processor with 1 2 gigahertz 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:08.340
 He still had 1 GB of RAM 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:11.220
 and four gigabytes of memory for the 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:12.000
 user and this one can of course 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:13.710
 be extended 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:17.400
 Here we take the back 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:19.110
 From there you also see that this is a dual 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:21.689
 sim smartphone is here so we can 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:22.400
 use two sim cards and here too 

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:25.160
 one more 

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:27.440
 USB card just to the memory 

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:28.700
 Expand because, for example, not violence 

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:32.410
 are used so if you play 

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:36.590
 want to install your music etc 

00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:39.320
 two cameras are here once on 

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:42.020

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:48.770
 back a 5 megapixel camera with 

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:51.220
 led light and here is as android im 

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:51.220
 moment 

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:58.370
 the version 4.2 installed 

00:01:54.830 --> 00:02:00.530
 the engine already plays here angry birds 

00:01:58.370 --> 00:02:04.119
 let's see 

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:04.119
 still one of the most popular games 

00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:11.330
 I'll give you that absolutely liquid here 

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:11.330
 it 

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:15.209
 we stand 

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:20.450
 and under the display we have the here 

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:26.140
 three android touch buttons as one time 

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:26.140
 here for the minimum and back 

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:30.910
 makes a very good impression of this 

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:34.180
 smartphone for 169 euros in any case 

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:34.990
 a taster will soon be in germany 

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:37.180
 be available 

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:39.580
 In short, the device around there we have here 

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:43.210
 his loving on the right side 

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:45.610

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:53.500
 and here on the left side the ball 

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:56.020
 however, that we have another ring here 

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:59.550

00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:59.550
 feels very good too 

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:05.879
 So that's the necessary quantum 500 here 

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:06.959
 smartphone and ask her then 

00:03:05.879 --> 00:03:08.459
