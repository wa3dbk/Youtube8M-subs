00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:20.240 
wondered if you could do it with the

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:22.779 
wondered if you could do it with the
microphone<00:00:21.240> that's<00:00:21.390> built<00:00:21.660> into<00:00:21.840> my<00:00:22.140> ps4

00:00:22.779 --> 00:00:22.789 
microphone that's built into my ps4

00:00:22.789 --> 00:00:26.000 
microphone that's built into my ps4
camera<00:00:23.789> and<00:00:23.939> if<00:00:24.600> I<00:00:25.080> could<00:00:25.320> use<00:00:25.500> a<00:00:25.529> USB

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:26.010 
camera and if I could use a USB

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:27.679 
camera and if I could use a USB
microphone<00:00:26.220> to<00:00:26.550> plug<00:00:26.730> into<00:00:26.910> the<00:00:27.060> ps4<00:00:27.300> as<00:00:27.539> well

00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:27.689 
microphone to plug into the ps4 as well

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:29.540 
microphone to plug into the ps4 as well
turns<00:00:28.349> out<00:00:28.470> you<00:00:28.560> can<00:00:28.680> do<00:00:28.769> all<00:00:29.010> three<00:00:29.369> of<00:00:29.400> those

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:29.550 
turns out you can do all three of those

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:32.030 
turns out you can do all three of those
but<00:00:30.390> it's<00:00:30.810> really<00:00:31.199> hard<00:00:31.410> to<00:00:31.560> find<00:00:31.710> out<00:00:31.830> how<00:00:31.949> to

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:32.040 
but it's really hard to find out how to

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:33.680 
but it's really hard to find out how to
do<00:00:32.279> it<00:00:32.430> I<00:00:32.460> looked<00:00:32.730> everywhere<00:00:32.880> online<00:00:33.239> but<00:00:33.660> I

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:33.690 
do it I looked everywhere online but I

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:35.299 
do it I looked everywhere online but I
finally<00:00:34.170> found<00:00:34.350> the<00:00:34.530> answer<00:00:34.559> so<00:00:35.040> I<00:00:35.070> thought

00:00:35.299 --> 00:00:35.309 
finally found the answer so I thought

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:37.549 
finally found the answer so I thought
I'd<00:00:35.399> share<00:00:35.610> it<00:00:35.670> with<00:00:35.850> everyone<00:00:36.090> in<00:00:36.390> case<00:00:37.110> they

00:00:37.549 --> 00:00:37.559 
I'd share it with everyone in case they

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:39.350 
I'd share it with everyone in case they
have<00:00:37.710> problems<00:00:38.100> doing<00:00:38.250> it<00:00:38.399> as<00:00:38.489> well<00:00:38.640> so<00:00:38.820> the
