high<00:00:30.170> game<00:00:30.410> pedal<00:00:30.770> the<00:00:30.890> heavy<00:00:31.160> if<00:00:31.940> you<00:00:32.119> will<00:00:32.300> so

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:32.720 
high game pedal the heavy if you will so

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:33.790 
high game pedal the heavy if you will so
why<00:00:32.840> don't<00:00:32.960> you<00:00:32.989> walk<00:00:33.199> us<00:00:33.230> through<00:00:33.410> that<00:00:33.559> and

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:33.800 
why don't you walk us through that and

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:35.080 
why don't you walk us through that and
then<00:00:33.920> the<00:00:34.040> other<00:00:34.190> pedal<00:00:34.430> you<00:00:34.580> guys<00:00:34.730> brought<00:00:34.940> to

00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:35.090 
then the other pedal you guys brought to

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:37.060 
then the other pedal you guys brought to
the<00:00:35.210> show<00:00:35.390> sure<00:00:36.080> yeah<00:00:36.290> so<00:00:36.470> the<00:00:36.559> heavy<00:00:36.739> is<00:00:37.040> a

00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:37.070 
the show sure yeah so the heavy is a

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:39.549 
the show sure yeah so the heavy is a
two-channel<00:00:37.940> high<00:00:38.090> gain<00:00:38.270> pedal<00:00:38.629> it's<00:00:39.320> got<00:00:39.440> two

00:00:39.549 --> 00:00:39.559 
two-channel high gain pedal it's got two

00:00:39.559 --> 00:00:42.219 
two-channel high gain pedal it's got two
channels<00:00:39.770> heavy<00:00:40.100> and<00:00:40.400> heavier<00:00:40.900> the<00:00:41.900> sampler

00:00:42.219 --> 00:00:42.229 
channels heavy and heavier the sampler

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:43.630 
channels heavy and heavier the sampler
Cody<00:00:42.440> just<00:00:42.650> played<00:00:42.830> was<00:00:43.070> on<00:00:43.370> the<00:00:43.460> heavy

00:00:43.630 --> 00:00:43.640 
Cody just played was on the heavy

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:45.729 
Cody just played was on the heavy
channel<00:00:44.059> and<00:00:44.210> the<00:00:45.080> heavier<00:00:45.350> channel<00:00:45.680> is

00:00:45.729 --> 00:00:45.739 
channel and the heavier channel is

00:00:45.739 --> 00:00:47.560 
channel and the heavier channel is
basically<00:00:46.010> just<00:00:46.100> more<00:00:46.550> gain<00:00:46.820> available<00:00:47.390> so

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:47.570 
basically just more gain available so

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:58.840 
basically just more gain available so
I'll<00:00:47.750> just<00:00:47.900> give<00:00:48.260> it<00:00:48.379> typical<00:00:49.010> Cody

00:00:58.840 --> 00:00:58.850 

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:03.380 

and<00:00:59.850> so<00:01:00.840> each<00:01:00.960> channel<00:01:01.320> has<00:01:01.940> gain<00:01:02.940> control<00:01:03.360> and

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
and so each channel has gain control and

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:06.770 
and so each channel has gain control and
output<00:01:03.870> control<00:01:04.170> and<00:01:04.440> a<00:01:04.920> selectable<00:01:05.550> mid<00:01:05.880> with

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:06.780 
output control and a selectable mid with

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:08.090 
output control and a selectable mid with
three<00:01:07.020> three<00:01:07.409> selectable<00:01:07.770> center

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
three three selectable center

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:10.250 
three three selectable center
frequencies<00:01:08.580> and<00:01:08.820> there's<00:01:09.540> also<00:01:09.750> a<00:01:09.869> weight

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260 
frequencies and there's also a weight

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:12.080 
frequencies and there's also a weight
knob<00:01:10.830> on<00:01:11.010> each<00:01:11.159> channel<00:01:11.520> and<00:01:11.729> the<00:01:11.850> weight<00:01:11.970> I

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.090 
knob on each channel and the weight I

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:12.859 
knob on each channel and the weight I
was<00:01:12.119> pretty<00:01:12.390> cool

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
was pretty cool

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:14.540 
was pretty cool
it<00:01:13.080> changes<00:01:13.500> the<00:01:13.680> character<00:01:14.100> of<00:01:14.190> the<00:01:14.280> low<00:01:14.400> end

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:14.550 
it changes the character of the low end

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:17.570 
it changes the character of the low end
so<00:01:15.290> all<00:01:16.290> the<00:01:16.380> way<00:01:16.470> to<00:01:16.530> the<00:01:16.650> left<00:01:16.800> would<00:01:17.009> be<00:01:17.040> like

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
so all the way to the left would be like

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:19.160 
so all the way to the left would be like
the<00:01:17.700> tightest<00:01:18.060> setting<00:01:18.390> and<00:01:18.570> then<00:01:18.750> as<00:01:18.900> you<00:01:19.050> go

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
the tightest setting and then as you go

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:21.050 
the tightest setting and then as you go
up<00:01:19.200> you'll<00:01:19.740> get<00:01:19.860> more<00:01:20.100> low-end<00:01:20.400> throb<00:01:20.820> and

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
up you'll get more low-end throb and

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:22.730 
up you'll get more low-end throb and
kind<00:01:21.180> of<00:01:21.240> a<00:01:21.300> bigger<00:01:21.659> sound<00:01:22.020> so<00:01:22.229> peaceful<00:01:22.710> and

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
kind of a bigger sound so peaceful and

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:29.030 
kind of a bigger sound so peaceful and
decent<00:01:23.070> want<00:01:23.250> music<00:01:23.520> no<00:01:23.670> do

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:32.240 

so<00:01:29.850> you<00:01:29.910> know<00:01:30.060> it<00:01:30.150> lets<00:01:30.330> you<00:01:30.450> kind<00:01:31.320> of<00:01:31.440> tailor

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250 
so you know it lets you kind of tailor

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:33.560 
so you know it lets you kind of tailor
based<00:01:32.700> on<00:01:32.880> you<00:01:32.970> know<00:01:33.000> what<00:01:33.090> you're<00:01:33.270> gonna<00:01:33.360> play

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570 
based on you know what you're gonna play

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:35.060 
based on you know what you're gonna play
if<00:01:33.690> you're<00:01:33.780> doing<00:01:33.990> really<00:01:34.170> tight<00:01:34.350> tight<00:01:34.830> stuff

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070 
if you're doing really tight tight stuff

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:36.590 
if you're doing really tight tight stuff
you<00:01:35.220> can<00:01:35.340> keep<00:01:35.490> it<00:01:35.640> tight<00:01:35.820> but<00:01:36.240> if<00:01:36.360> you<00:01:36.420> want

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
you can keep it tight but if you want

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:38.270 
you can keep it tight but if you want
that<00:01:36.720> big<00:01:36.930> sound<00:01:37.140> you<00:01:37.350> can<00:01:37.470> open<00:01:37.740> it<00:01:37.830> up<00:01:37.890> and<00:01:38.040> I

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280 
that big sound you can open it up and I

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:40.430 
that big sound you can open it up and I
get<00:01:38.610> lots<00:01:38.730> of<00:01:38.910> bottom<00:01:39.210> in<00:01:39.330> and<00:01:39.600> also<00:01:40.230> on<00:01:40.320> each

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:40.440 
get lots of bottom in and also on each

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:42.710 
get lots of bottom in and also on each
channel<00:01:40.740> there's<00:01:40.920> a<00:01:41.010> gate<00:01:41.390> that<00:01:42.390> you<00:01:42.480> can<00:01:42.600> have

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720 
channel there's a gate that you can have

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:45.110 
channel there's a gate that you can have
it<00:01:42.840> off<00:01:43.010> natural<00:01:44.010> or<00:01:44.160> aggressive<00:01:44.610> aggressive

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:45.120 
it off natural or aggressive aggressive

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:48.020 
it off natural or aggressive aggressive
would<00:01:45.420> be<00:01:45.540> your<00:01:45.900> standard<00:01:46.350> gate<00:01:46.820> where<00:01:47.820> you

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
would be your standard gate where you

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:49.460 
would be your standard gate where you
know<00:01:48.120> it's<00:01:48.240> gonna<00:01:48.330> cut<00:01:48.810> tight<00:01:49.020> so<00:01:49.260> if<00:01:49.350> you're

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:49.470 
know it's gonna cut tight so if you're

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:51.980 
know it's gonna cut tight so if you're
playing<00:01:49.650> tight<00:01:50.130> starts<00:01:50.910> and<00:01:51.030> stops<00:01:51.240> it<00:01:51.810> work

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990 
playing tight starts and stops it work

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:53.930 
playing tight starts and stops it work
really<00:01:52.110> well<00:01:52.350> and<00:01:52.590> the<00:01:53.190> natural<00:01:53.670> settings

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:53.940 
really well and the natural settings

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:56.840 
really well and the natural settings
pretty<00:01:54.150> cool<00:01:54.360> in<00:01:54.600> that<00:01:55.110> it<00:01:55.350> doesn't<00:01:55.610> clamp<00:01:56.610> off

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:56.850 
pretty cool in that it doesn't clamp off

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:58.250 
pretty cool in that it doesn't clamp off
the<00:01:57.000> end<00:01:57.120> of<00:01:57.180> your<00:01:57.270> notes<00:01:57.480> so<00:01:57.600> like<00:01:58.050> if<00:01:58.140> you

00:01:58.250 --> 00:01:58.260 
the end of your notes so like if you

00:01:58.260 --> 00:01:59.090 
the end of your notes so like if you
just<00:01:58.320> want<00:01:58.500> to<00:01:58.530> play<00:01:58.650> something<00:01:58.860> that'll

00:01:59.090 --> 00:01:59.100 
just want to play something that'll

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:06.680 
just want to play something that'll
decay<00:02:04.010> naturally<00:02:05.010> but<00:02:05.940> then<00:02:06.150> as<00:02:06.390> soon<00:02:06.420> as<00:02:06.630> you

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:06.690 
decay naturally but then as soon as you

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:09.260 
decay naturally but then as soon as you
stop<00:02:06.930> playing<00:02:07.200> it<00:02:07.650> will<00:02:07.770> clamp<00:02:08.010> down<00:02:08.220> and<00:02:08.580> you

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:09.270 
stop playing it will clamp down and you

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:12.230 
stop playing it will clamp down and you
know<00:02:09.390> is<00:02:09.510> that<00:02:09.690> your<00:02:09.840> signal<00:02:10.140> chain<00:02:11.090> and<00:02:12.090> then

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:12.240 
know is that your signal chain and then

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:14.120 
know is that your signal chain and then
there's<00:02:12.390> a<00:02:12.450> high<00:02:12.600> end<00:02:12.750> little<00:02:12.930> band<00:02:13.110> EQ<00:02:13.980> that's

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:14.130 
there's a high end little band EQ that's

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:17.150 
there's a high end little band EQ that's
universal<00:02:14.910> to<00:02:15.060> the<00:02:15.180> pedal<00:02:15.500> and<00:02:16.500> then<00:02:16.770> the

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:17.160 
universal to the pedal and then the

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:18.620 
universal to the pedal and then the
other<00:02:17.280> pedal<00:02:17.460> we<00:02:17.610> have<00:02:17.760> that<00:02:18.390> we're<00:02:18.480> showing

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:18.630 
other pedal we have that we're showing

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:21.170 
other pedal we have that we're showing
here<00:02:18.990> that's<00:02:19.200> also<00:02:19.590> a<00:02:19.710> prototype<00:02:20.250> is<00:02:21.120> the

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:21.180 
here that's also a prototype is the

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:24.740 
here that's also a prototype is the
nebulous<00:02:21.810> and<00:02:22.430> it<00:02:23.430> is<00:02:23.580> a<00:02:23.610> chorus<00:02:24.150> vibrato

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:24.750 
nebulous and it is a chorus vibrato

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:27.980 
nebulous and it is a chorus vibrato
flanger<00:02:25.850> all-in-one<00:02:26.850> pedal<00:02:27.180> so<00:02:27.630> basically

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:27.990 
flanger all-in-one pedal so basically

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:29.240 
flanger all-in-one pedal so basically
with<00:02:28.200> the<00:02:28.290> modes<00:02:28.500> up<00:02:28.709> here<00:02:28.860> you<00:02:28.950> can<00:02:29.100> select

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:29.250 
with the modes up here you can select

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:30.410 
with the modes up here you can select
whether<00:02:29.490> you<00:02:29.580> want<00:02:29.730> the<00:02:29.790> chorus<00:02:30.030> for<00:02:30.120> battle

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:30.420 
whether you want the chorus for battle

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:32.690 
whether you want the chorus for battle
or<00:02:30.450> flanger<00:02:30.930> and<00:02:31.080> then<00:02:31.470> each<00:02:31.590> mode<00:02:32.160> has<00:02:32.280> three

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:32.700 
or flanger and then each mode has three

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:34.940 
or flanger and then each mode has three
sub<00:02:33.000> modes<00:02:33.239> and<00:02:34.080> there's<00:02:34.410> a<00:02:34.440> little<00:02:34.530> chart<00:02:34.830> on

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:34.950 
sub modes and there's a little chart on

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:35.990 
sub modes and there's a little chart on
the<00:02:35.010> front<00:02:35.190> of<00:02:35.250> the<00:02:35.310> pedal<00:02:35.580> here<00:02:35.700> at<00:02:35.790> all<00:02:35.880> if

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:36.000 
the front of the pedal here at all if

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:37.820 
the front of the pedal here at all if
you<00:02:36.090> can<00:02:36.239> catch<00:02:36.420> it<00:02:36.450> it<00:02:37.290> kind<00:02:37.470> of<00:02:37.500> gives<00:02:37.680> you<00:02:37.739> a

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:37.830 
you can catch it it kind of gives you a

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:40.850 
you can catch it it kind of gives you a
roadmap<00:02:38.250> of<00:02:38.280> what's<00:02:38.910> available<00:02:39.030> and<00:02:39.860> I'll

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:40.860 
roadmap of what's available and I'll

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:42.320 
roadmap of what's available and I'll
give<00:02:41.010> you<00:02:41.070> a<00:02:41.130> couple<00:02:41.310> samples<00:02:41.790> so<00:02:42.090> this<00:02:42.209> is

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:42.330 
give you a couple samples so this is

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:45.199 
give you a couple samples so this is
just<00:02:42.510> kind<00:02:42.720> of<00:02:42.750> your<00:02:42.810> standard<00:02:44.209> standard

00:02:45.199 --> 00:02:45.209 
just kind of your standard standard

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:49.490 
just kind of your standard standard
chorus

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:49.500 

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:53.010 

and<00:02:50.500> there's<00:02:50.770> some<00:02:51.010> cool<00:02:51.550> stuff<00:02:51.790> like<00:02:52.020> submode

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:53.020 
and there's some cool stuff like submode

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:56.750 
and there's some cool stuff like submode
see<00:02:53.230> the<00:02:53.470> chorus<00:02:53.800> has<00:02:53.980> anna<00:02:54.220> tremolo<00:02:54.730> built<00:02:54.970> in

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:56.760 
see the chorus has anna tremolo built in

00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:59.010 
see the chorus has anna tremolo built in
its<00:02:57.760> chorus<00:02:58.150> and<00:02:58.330> shut<00:02:58.480> alone<00:02:58.630> their<00:02:58.810> sync

00:02:59.010 --> 00:02:59.020 
its chorus and shut alone their sync

00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:01.110 
its chorus and shut alone their sync
together<00:02:59.170> in<00:02:59.500> time<00:02:59.680> which<00:03:00.640> gives<00:03:00.850> it<00:03:00.940> some

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:01.120 
together in time which gives it some

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:05.940 
together in time which gives it some
really<00:03:01.330> nice<00:03:01.510> effect<00:03:03.120> and<00:03:04.120> then<00:03:04.270> the<00:03:04.950> vibrato

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:05.950 
really nice effect and then the vibrato

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:09.420 
really nice effect and then the vibrato
has<00:03:07.470> somewhat<00:03:08.470> a<00:03:08.590> would<00:03:08.740> be<00:03:08.770> like<00:03:08.950> a<00:03:08.980> unified

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:09.430 
has somewhat a would be like a unified

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:21.090 
has somewhat a would be like a unified
type<00:03:09.760> thing<00:03:18.060> and<00:03:19.060> then<00:03:19.630> B<00:03:20.470> is<00:03:20.590> like<00:03:20.770> a<00:03:20.800> standard

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:21.100 
type thing and then B is like a standard

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:24.660 
type thing and then B is like a standard
vibrato

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:24.670 

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:26.610 

and<00:03:25.060> then<00:03:25.540> cease<00:03:25.720> actually<00:03:26.050> like<00:03:26.170> a<00:03:26.260> rotary

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:26.620 
and then cease actually like a rotary

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:31.830 
and then cease actually like a rotary
simulator<00:03:28.350> and<00:03:29.459> for<00:03:30.459> the<00:03:30.520> flanger<00:03:30.880> mode<00:03:31.060> you

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:31.840 
simulator and for the flanger mode you

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:34.980 
simulator and for the flanger mode you
got<00:03:31.990> like<00:03:32.140> a<00:03:32.170> 60s<00:03:32.650> style<00:03:32.830> flanger<00:03:33.430> a<00:03:33.780> 70<00:03:34.780> style

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:34.990 
got like a 60s style flanger a 70 style

00:03:34.990 --> 00:03:36.870 
got like a 60s style flanger a 70 style
and<00:03:35.290> then<00:03:35.410> a<00:03:35.440> through<00:03:35.980> zero<00:03:36.220> flanger<00:03:36.610> as<00:03:36.700> well

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:36.880 
and then a through zero flanger as well

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:38.460 
and then a through zero flanger as well
which<00:03:37.060> is<00:03:37.209> kind<00:03:37.750> of<00:03:37.780> rare<00:03:37.959> these<00:03:38.110> days<00:03:38.170> I'll

00:03:38.460 --> 00:03:38.470 
which is kind of rare these days I'll

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:51.090 
which is kind of rare these days I'll
show<00:03:38.620> you<00:03:38.680> the<00:03:38.770> through<00:03:39.010> 0<00:03:39.310> here<00:03:49.380> this<00:03:50.380> special

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:51.100 
show you the through 0 here this special

00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:53.360 
show you the through 0 here this special
switch<00:03:51.280> kind<00:03:51.610> of<00:03:51.670> changes<00:03:52.120> with<00:03:52.630> each<00:03:52.660> setting

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:53.370 
switch kind of changes with each setting

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:56.190 
switch kind of changes with each setting
along<00:03:54.370> here<00:03:54.640> it<00:03:54.730> performs<00:03:55.690> a<00:03:55.780> different<00:03:56.050> mode

00:03:56.190 --> 00:03:56.200 
along here it performs a different mode

00:03:56.200 --> 00:03:58.800 
along here it performs a different mode
for<00:03:56.530> each<00:03:56.880> yeah<00:03:57.880> or<00:03:58.060> a<00:03:58.090> different<00:03:58.510> function

00:03:58.800 --> 00:03:58.810 
for each yeah or a different function

00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:01.380 
for each yeah or a different function
for<00:03:59.140> each<00:03:59.200> mode<00:03:59.410> I<00:03:59.440> should<00:03:59.709> say<00:04:00.120> and<00:04:01.120> it's

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:01.390 
for each mode I should say and it's

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:03.570 
for each mode I should say and it's
pretty<00:04:01.540> cool<00:04:01.720> let's<00:04:01.959> see<00:04:02.050> kind<00:04:02.590> of<00:04:02.680> tweak<00:04:02.890> even

00:04:03.570 --> 00:04:03.580 
pretty cool let's see kind of tweak even

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:05.430 
pretty cool let's see kind of tweak even
deeper<00:04:03.940> and<00:04:04.120> then<00:04:04.510> all<00:04:04.630> those<00:04:04.810> settings<00:04:05.110> are

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:05.440 
deeper and then all those settings are

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:07.979 
deeper and then all those settings are
stabled<00:04:06.010> on<00:04:06.100> presets<00:04:06.519> and<00:04:07.030> the<00:04:07.420> presets<00:04:07.810> are

00:04:07.979 --> 00:04:07.989 
stabled on presets and the presets are

00:04:07.989 --> 00:04:10.050 
stabled on presets and the presets are
available<00:04:08.410> you<00:04:09.220> can<00:04:09.370> set<00:04:09.580> it<00:04:09.670> to<00:04:09.700> have<00:04:09.850> either

00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:10.060 
available you can set it to have either

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:13.890 
available you can set it to have either
0<00:04:10.650> 1<00:04:11.650> 2<00:04:11.800> 3<00:04:11.830> all<00:04:12.130> the<00:04:12.190> way<00:04:12.220> up<00:04:12.340> to<00:04:12.459> 9<00:04:12.690> sorry<00:04:13.690> now<00:04:13.810> we
