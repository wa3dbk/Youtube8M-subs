00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:19.490 
here's what what we what we found is you
know<00:01:18.509> the<00:01:18.659> ridge<00:01:18.869> was<00:01:19.020> originally<00:01:19.380> designed

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500 
know the ridge was originally designed

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:21.800 
know the ridge was originally designed
to<00:01:19.860> like<00:01:20.009> insulate<00:01:20.490> wire<00:01:20.729> splices<00:01:21.360> so<00:01:21.659> here

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
to like insulate wire splices so here

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:23.660 
to like insulate wire splices so here
i've<00:01:21.930> got<00:01:22.049> a<00:01:22.080> real<00:01:22.290> nice<00:01:22.439> soldered<00:01:22.890> wires<00:01:23.159> wire

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
i've got a real nice soldered wires wire

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:26.990 
i've got a real nice soldered wires wire
splice<00:01:24.049> what<00:01:25.049> i<00:01:25.080> do<00:01:25.200> is<00:01:25.439> i<00:01:25.560> figure<00:01:25.890> out<00:01:26.000> you

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
splice what i do is i figure out you

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:27.980 
splice what i do is i figure out you
know<00:01:27.030> i<00:01:27.090> take<00:01:27.210> a<00:01:27.299> piece<00:01:27.420> of<00:01:27.479> tubing<00:01:27.720> that's

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990 
know i take a piece of tubing that's

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:30.710 
know i take a piece of tubing that's
roughly<00:01:28.439> twice<00:01:29.009> the<00:01:29.250> diameter<00:01:29.400> is<00:01:30.329> roughly

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720 
roughly twice the diameter is roughly

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:33.020 
roughly twice the diameter is roughly
twice<00:01:30.960> the<00:01:31.020> diameter<00:01:31.259> and<00:01:31.860> i<00:01:32.310> cut<00:01:32.520> how<00:01:32.700> long

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
twice the diameter and i cut how long

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:34.819 
twice the diameter and i cut how long
I'm<00:01:33.210> going<00:01:33.360> to<00:01:33.420> need<00:01:33.659> make<00:01:34.259> it<00:01:34.380> a<00:01:34.470> little

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:34.829 
I'm going to need make it a little

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:37.370 
I'm going to need make it a little
longer<00:01:35.130> because<00:01:35.490> remember<00:01:36.360> the<00:01:36.869> name<00:01:37.049> is<00:01:37.170> heat

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
longer because remember the name is heat

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:39.980 
longer because remember the name is heat
shrink<00:01:37.680> so<00:01:37.890> it<00:01:38.009> does<00:01:38.220> shrink<00:01:38.549> it<00:01:38.939> shrinks<00:01:39.840> both

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:39.990 
shrink so it does shrink it shrinks both

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:42.109 
shrink so it does shrink it shrinks both
in<00:01:40.140> diameter<00:01:40.439> and<00:01:40.829> length<00:01:40.860> so<00:01:41.759> we'll<00:01:41.909> get<00:01:42.000> rid

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:42.119 
in diameter and length so we'll get rid

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:43.850 
in diameter and length so we'll get rid
of<00:01:42.180> that<00:01:42.320> we're<00:01:43.320> going<00:01:43.500> to<00:01:43.560> have<00:01:43.680> with<00:01:43.829> that

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860 
of that we're going to have with that

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:46.370 
of that we're going to have with that
tool<00:01:44.220> now<00:01:44.399> so<00:01:45.149> all<00:01:45.270> we<00:01:45.509> do<00:01:45.630> is<00:01:45.780> we<00:01:45.899> slide<00:01:46.200> it

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380 
tool now so all we do is we slide it

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:50.330 
tool now so all we do is we slide it
over<00:01:46.619> the<00:01:47.159> splice<00:01:48.090> just<00:01:48.689> like<00:01:48.840> that<00:01:49.340> right

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:50.340 
over the splice just like that right

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:50.569

you've<00:03:46.410> crimped<00:03:46.739> it<00:03:46.829> on<00:03:46.980> but<00:03:47.880> you<00:03:48.060> want<00:03:48.269> to

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:48.390 
you've crimped it on but you want to

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:51.680 
you've crimped it on but you want to
protect<00:03:48.750> it<00:03:48.840> maybe<00:03:49.109> from<00:03:49.940> flexing<00:03:50.940> that's<00:03:51.329> one

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:51.690 
protect it maybe from flexing that's one

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:53.120 
protect it maybe from flexing that's one
of<00:03:51.780> the<00:03:51.870> things<00:03:52.320> that<00:03:52.470> heat<00:03:52.590> shrink<00:03:52.829> is<00:03:52.859> really

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:53.130 
of the things that heat shrink is really

00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:55.460 
of the things that heat shrink is really
good<00:03:53.280> at<00:03:53.459> is<00:03:53.700> protecting<00:03:54.660> it<00:03:54.750> from<00:03:54.810> flexing<00:03:55.290> so

00:03:55.460 --> 00:03:55.470 
good at is protecting it from flexing so

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:56.900 
good at is protecting it from flexing so
you<00:03:55.829> know<00:03:55.920> I'll<00:03:56.130> just<00:03:56.250> take<00:03:56.400> that<00:03:56.430> same<00:03:56.730> piece

00:03:56.900 --> 00:03:56.910 
you know I'll just take that same piece

00:03:56.910 --> 00:04:00.670 
you know I'll just take that same piece
of<00:03:56.940> heat<00:03:57.150> shrink<00:03:57.380> since<00:03:58.380> we're<00:03:58.530> really<00:03:58.680> not

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:00.680 
of heat shrink since we're really not

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:02.479 
of heat shrink since we're really not
color-coordinating<00:04:01.680> anything<00:04:01.980> today<00:04:02.220> get

00:04:02.479 --> 00:04:02.489 
color-coordinating anything today get

00:04:02.489 --> 00:04:07.640 
color-coordinating anything today get
rid<00:04:02.609> of<00:04:02.700> that<00:04:02.850> and<00:04:04.040> do<00:04:05.040> this<00:04:05.310> and<00:04:06.440> slide<00:04:07.440> that

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:07.650 
rid of that and do this and slide that

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:09.949 
rid of that and do this and slide that
right<00:04:07.829> through<00:04:08.329> you<00:04:09.329> know<00:04:09.420> little<00:04:09.720> tight

00:04:09.949 --> 00:04:09.959 
right through you know little tight

00:04:09.959 --> 00:04:12.170 
right through you know little tight
there<00:04:10.170> that's<00:04:10.440> okay<00:04:10.709> and<00:04:11.000> there<00:04:12.000> it<00:04:12.120> is

00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:12.180 
there that's okay and there it is

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:14.690 
there that's okay and there it is
looking<00:04:12.600> good<00:04:12.780> so<00:04:12.989> again<00:04:13.920> the<00:04:14.069> heat<00:04:14.220> gun<00:04:14.400> and

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:14.700 
looking good so again the heat gun and

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:19.699 
looking good so again the heat gun and
put<00:04:15.600> that<00:04:15.750> on<00:04:15.989> there<00:04:17.239> now<00:04:18.239> we've<00:04:18.450> used<00:04:18.479> a<00:04:19.049> heat

00:04:19.699 --> 00:04:19.709 
put that on there now we've used a heat

00:04:19.709 --> 00:04:23.810 
put that on there now we've used a heat
shrink<00:04:20.039> for<00:04:20.250> zip<00:04:20.519> zipper<00:04:21.060> pulls<00:04:22.669> some<00:04:23.669> of<00:04:23.760> the

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:23.820 
shrink for zip zipper pulls some of the

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:27.180 
shrink for zip zipper pulls some of the
guys<00:04:23.940> have<00:04:24.240> done<00:04:24.810> p-nut<00:04:25.560> lighters<00:04:25.979> with

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:27.190 
guys have done p-nut lighters with

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:30.760 
guys have done p-nut lighters with
survival<00:04:28.190> equipment<00:04:29.060> inside<00:04:29.660> here<00:04:30.620> it<00:04:30.740> is

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:30.770 
survival equipment inside here it is

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:31.510 
survival equipment inside here it is
quick<00:04:31.070> and<00:04:31.160> easy

00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:31.520 
quick and easy

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:33.940 
quick and easy
that<00:04:31.670> was<00:04:31.900> so<00:04:32.900> we've<00:04:33.140> got<00:04:33.350> some<00:04:33.650> flex

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:33.950 
that was so we've got some flex

00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:35.860 
that was so we've got some flex
protection<00:04:34.640> right<00:04:35.030> here<00:04:35.240> at<00:04:35.330> the<00:04:35.420> base<00:04:35.570> you

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:35.870 
protection right here at the base you

00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:37.690 
protection right here at the base you
know<00:04:36.470> nothing's<00:04:36.770> gonna<00:04:36.890> no<00:04:37.100> corrosion<00:04:37.610> or

00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:37.700 
know nothing's gonna no corrosion or

00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:39.010 
know nothing's gonna no corrosion or
anything<00:04:37.850> is<00:04:37.970> going<00:04:38.120> to<00:04:38.180> get<00:04:38.300> inside<00:04:38.600> there<00:04:38.900> a

00:04:39.010 --> 00:04:39.020 
anything is going to get inside there a

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:40.810 
anything is going to get inside there a
whole<00:04:39.620> lot<00:04:39.830> cleaner<00:04:40.190> and<00:04:40.430> smoother<00:04:40.790> than

00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:40.820 
whole lot cleaner and smoother than

00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:44.620 
whole lot cleaner and smoother than
taping<00:04:41.390> just<00:04:42.110> a<00:04:42.260> it's<00:04:42.530> really<00:04:42.620> a<00:04:42.860> neat<00:04:43.700> a<00:04:44.210> neat

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:44.630 
taping just a it's really a neat a neat

00:04:44.630 --> 00:04:49.000 
taping just a it's really a neat a neat
thing<00:04:44.920> so<00:04:45.920> that's<00:04:46.790> that's<00:04:47.390> two<00:04:47.960> examples<00:04:48.470> one

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:49.010 
thing so that's that's two examples one

00:04:49.010 --> 00:04:50.860 
thing so that's that's two examples one
of<00:04:49.100> the<00:04:49.160> other<00:04:49.370> examples<00:04:50.060> is<00:04:50.270> when<00:04:50.600> you<00:04:50.690> have

00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:50.870 
of the other examples is when you have

00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:52.840 
of the other examples is when you have
two<00:04:51.080> wires<00:04:51.320> that<00:04:51.620> are<00:04:51.680> running<00:04:52.010> parallel<00:04:52.250> and

00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:52.850 
two wires that are running parallel and

00:04:52.850 --> 00:04:55.720 
two wires that are running parallel and
you<00:04:53.390> want<00:04:53.780> to<00:04:53.960> turn<00:04:54.140> them<00:04:54.290> into<00:04:54.440> one<00:04:54.530> wire<00:04:55.010> you

00:04:55.720 --> 00:04:55.730 
you want to turn them into one wire you

00:04:55.730 --> 00:04:58.030 
you want to turn them into one wire you
can<00:04:55.820> do<00:04:55.940> the<00:04:56.060> exact<00:04:56.330> same<00:04:56.510> thing<00:04:56.780> again<00:04:57.710> you

00:04:58.030 --> 00:04:58.040 
can do the exact same thing again you

00:04:58.040 --> 00:04:59.440 
can do the exact same thing again you
know<00:04:58.160> I<00:04:58.190> got<00:04:58.370> this<00:04:58.460> piece<00:04:58.670> of<00:04:58.820> red<00:04:58.970> red<00:04:59.270> heat

00:04:59.440 --> 00:04:59.450 
know I got this piece of red red heat

00:04:59.450 --> 00:05:01.480 
know I got this piece of red red heat
shrink<00:04:59.720> out<00:04:59.870> I'll<00:05:00.410> take<00:05:00.650> the<00:05:00.770> two<00:05:00.890> wires<00:05:00.920> I'll

00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:01.490 
shrink out I'll take the two wires I'll

00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:04.780 
shrink out I'll take the two wires I'll
put<00:05:01.820> them<00:05:01.880> in<00:05:02.060> there<00:05:02.270> and<00:05:03.400> just<00:05:04.400> keep<00:05:04.520> drink

00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:04.790 
put them in there and just keep drink

00:05:04.790 --> 00:05:07.120 
put them in there and just keep drink
that<00:05:04.940> down<00:05:05.120> and<00:05:05.420> I<00:05:05.510> have<00:05:05.750> joined<00:05:06.110> those<00:05:06.860> two

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:07.130 
that down and I have joined those two

00:05:07.130 --> 00:05:08.410 
that down and I have joined those two
wires<00:05:07.340> so<00:05:07.610> they're<00:05:07.730> not<00:05:07.850> going<00:05:07.970> to<00:05:08.000> be<00:05:08.120> shaping

00:05:08.410 --> 00:05:08.420 
wires so they're not going to be shaping

00:05:08.420 --> 00:05:10.720 
wires so they're not going to be shaping
against<00:05:08.900> each<00:05:09.050> other<00:05:09.290> and<00:05:09.530> they<00:05:10.190> are<00:05:10.340> not

00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:10.730 
against each other and they are not

00:05:10.730 --> 00:05:15.730 
against each other and they are not
going<00:05:10.940> anywhere<00:05:11.090> either<00:05:12.310> so<00:05:14.380> there<00:05:15.380> it<00:05:15.470> is<00:05:15.560> and

00:05:15.730 --> 00:05:15.740 
going anywhere either so there it is and

00:05:15.740 --> 00:05:18.010 
going anywhere either so there it is and
see<00:05:16.070> it's<00:05:16.220> shrinking<00:05:16.700> down<00:05:16.880> we<00:05:17.510> just<00:05:17.690> rotate

00:05:18.010 --> 00:05:18.020 
see it's shrinking down we just rotate

00:05:18.020 --> 00:05:20.230 
see it's shrinking down we just rotate
it<00:05:18.140> around<00:05:18.260> keep<00:05:18.680> it<00:05:18.800> moving<00:05:19.130> you've<00:05:19.730> locked

00:05:20.230 --> 00:05:20.240 
it around keep it moving you've locked

00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:23.800 
it around keep it moving you've locked
down<00:05:20.420> on<00:05:20.660> it<00:05:20.780> too<00:05:20.930> too<00:05:21.410> long<00:05:21.950> too<00:05:22.250> hard<00:05:22.750> you<00:05:23.750> can

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:23.810 
down on it too too long too hard you can

00:05:23.810 --> 00:05:25.690 
down on it too too long too hard you can
have<00:05:23.960> some<00:05:24.140> melting<00:05:25.040> and<00:05:25.280> stuff<00:05:25.490> and<00:05:25.580> it

00:05:25.690 --> 00:05:25.700 
have some melting and stuff and it

00:05:25.700 --> 00:05:27.520 
have some melting and stuff and it
doesn't<00:05:25.940> look<00:05:26.000> real<00:05:26.210> pretty<00:05:26.240> but<00:05:27.230> there<00:05:27.380> it<00:05:27.470> is

00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:27.530 
doesn't look real pretty but there it is

00:05:27.530 --> 00:05:30.460 
doesn't look real pretty but there it is
real<00:05:27.770> pretty<00:05:28.840> little<00:05:29.840> exposure<00:05:30.200> to<00:05:30.380> heat

00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:30.470 
real pretty little exposure to heat

00:05:30.470 --> 00:05:33.730 
real pretty little exposure to heat

took a piece of heat shrink fed it
through<00:05:53.570> and<00:05:54.190> same<00:05:55.190> thing<00:05:55.460> we're<00:05:56.060> just<00:05:56.180> going

want<00:06:08.660> to<00:06:08.780> shrink<00:06:09.500> the<00:06:09.710> heat<00:06:09.919> shrink<00:06:10.660> done

00:06:11.650 --> 00:06:11.660 
want to shrink the heat shrink done

00:06:11.660 --> 00:06:15.760 
want to shrink the heat shrink done
there<00:06:12.650> it<00:06:12.740> is<00:06:12.890> and<00:06:13.720> so<00:06:14.720> that's<00:06:14.930> going<00:06:15.020> to<00:06:15.110> gonna

00:06:15.760 --> 00:06:15.770 
there it is and so that's going to gonna

00:06:15.770 --> 00:06:18.640 
there it is and so that's going to gonna
harden<00:06:16.250> in<00:06:16.400> just<00:06:16.610> a<00:06:16.700> second<00:06:17.140> and<00:06:18.140> that's<00:06:18.530> going

00:06:18.640 --> 00:06:18.650 
harden in just a second and that's going

00:06:18.650 --> 00:06:20.860 
harden in just a second and that's going
to<00:06:18.710> give<00:06:18.890> that<00:06:19.130> the<00:06:19.610> owner<00:06:19.940> -<00:06:20.090> this<00:06:20.210> jacket<00:06:20.450> a

to give that the owner - this jacket a

00:06:20.870 --> 00:06:24.190 
to give that the owner - this jacket a
more<00:06:21.710> rigid<00:06:22.160> still<00:06:22.580> a<00:06:22.610> little<00:06:22.790> soft<00:06:23.090> so<00:06:23.480> you

00:06:24.190 --> 00:06:24.200 
more rigid still a little soft so you

00:06:24.200 --> 00:06:26.290 
more rigid still a little soft so you

00:06:27.730 --> 00:06:27.740 
hard we'll make a fingerprint but we

00:06:27.740 --> 00:06:30.010 
hard we'll make a fingerprint but we
don't<00:06:27.860> want<00:06:27.980> to<00:06:28.010> do<00:06:28.130> that<00:06:28.340> so<00:06:29.270> we'll<00:06:29.419> just<00:06:29.690> let
