extended slide stop lever so the

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:29.330 
extended slide stop lever so the
upgrades<00:00:27.810> we've<00:00:27.930> already<00:00:28.080> done<00:00:28.320> on<00:00:28.439> this<00:00:28.619> are

upgrades we've already done on this are

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:31.700 
upgrades we've already done on this are
the<00:00:29.939> slice<00:00:30.300> up<00:00:30.480> lever<00:00:30.689> and<00:00:30.840> I've<00:00:31.199> put<00:00:31.529> the

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:31.710 
the slice up lever and I've put the

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:33.920

three and a half pound lone wolf

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:36.639 
three and a half pound lone wolf
connector<00:00:34.920> on<00:00:35.070> there<00:00:35.309> to<00:00:35.520> reduce<00:00:36.300> the

00:00:36.639 --> 00:00:36.649 
connector on there to reduce the

00:00:36.649 --> 00:00:38.810 
connector on there to reduce the
pressure<00:00:37.649> required<00:00:38.100> to<00:00:38.340> pull<00:00:38.640> the<00:00:38.700> trigger

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:38.820

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:42.110 
pressure required to pull the trigger
and<00:00:39.290> so<00:00:40.290> far<00:00:40.530> that's<00:00:40.739> it<00:00:41.040> I've<00:00:41.370> made<00:00:41.640> a<00:00:41.850> lot<00:00:42.000> of

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:42.120 
and so far that's it I've made a lot of

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:43.430 
and so far that's it I've made a lot of
upgrades<00:00:42.420> on<00:00:42.540> my<00:00:42.600> other<00:00:42.719> Glocks<00:00:43.020> and<00:00:43.140> got<00:00:43.290> some

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
upgrades on my other Glocks and got some

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:45.380 
upgrades on my other Glocks and got some
people<00:00:43.559> requesting<00:00:44.219> hey<00:00:44.520> what<00:00:44.760> curb<00:00:44.940> what

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
people requesting hey what curb what

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:46.910 
people requesting hey what curb what
upgrades<00:00:45.780> do<00:00:45.930> you<00:00:45.989> do<00:00:46.079> on<00:00:46.110> your<00:00:46.350> Glock<00:00:46.530> and<00:00:46.739> so

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
upgrades do you do on your Glock and so

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:49.580 
upgrades do you do on your Glock and so
I<00:00:47.129> decided<00:00:47.640> to<00:00:47.879> use<00:00:48.000> my<00:00:48.120> vanilla<00:00:48.539> Glock<00:00:48.960> 19<00:00:49.410> as

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590 
I decided to use my vanilla Glock 19 as

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:54.260 
I decided to use my vanilla Glock 19 as
a<00:00:50.430> kind<00:00:51.360> of<00:00:51.420> test<00:00:51.809> case<00:00:52.710> for<00:00:53.010> installing<00:00:54.000> some

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270 
a kind of test case for installing some

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:55.490 
a kind of test case for installing some
of<00:00:54.300> these<00:00:54.449> upgrades<00:00:54.840> and<00:00:55.020> discussing<00:00:55.440> with

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
of these upgrades and discussing with

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:56.990 
of these upgrades and discussing with
them<00:00:55.590> and<00:00:55.739> I<00:00:55.770> think<00:00:55.829> they<00:00:56.039> are<00:00:56.070> upgrades<00:00:56.489> so<00:00:56.910> if

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000 
them and I think they are upgrades so if

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:58.279 
them and I think they are upgrades so if
you<00:00:57.090> watch<00:00:57.210> my<00:00:57.360> other<00:00:57.390> videos<00:00:57.780> you<00:00:57.960> know<00:00:58.109> my

00:00:58.279 --> 00:00:58.289 
you watch my other videos you know my

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:00.500 
you watch my other videos you know my
definition<00:00:58.500> of<00:00:58.920> an<00:00:59.039> upgrade<00:00:59.489> is<00:00:59.760> something

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510 
definition of an upgrade is something

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:02.060 
definition of an upgrade is something
that<00:01:00.629> improves<00:01:01.020> the<00:01:01.289> function<00:01:01.649> of<00:01:01.770> the<00:01:01.859> gun

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
that improves the function of the gun

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:05.179 
that improves the function of the gun
for<00:01:02.699> you<00:01:03.260> everyone<00:01:04.260> uses<00:01:04.559> guns<00:01:04.680> differently

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:05.189 
for you everyone uses guns differently

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:07.160 
for you everyone uses guns differently
therefore<00:01:05.700> what<00:01:06.119> could<00:01:06.330> be<00:01:06.450> your<00:01:06.479> upgrade

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
therefore what could be your upgrade

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:10.240 
therefore what could be your upgrade
could<00:01:08.100> be<00:01:08.250> a<00:01:08.400> downgrade<00:01:09.000> for<00:01:09.270> somebody<00:01:09.570> else

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:10.250 
could be a downgrade for somebody else

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:12.469 
could be a downgrade for somebody else
so<00:01:11.250> today's<00:01:11.610> upgrade<00:01:12.090> we're<00:01:12.180> going<00:01:12.299> to<00:01:12.360> talk

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479 
so today's upgrade we're going to talk

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:16.899 
so today's upgrade we're going to talk

17 if you've got one of those with a
rail<00:01:31.979> lots<00:01:32.670> of<00:01:32.759> Glocks<00:01:32.970> have<00:01:33.090> the<00:01:33.180> rail<00:01:33.329> -<00:01:33.509> some

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:33.689 
rail lots of Glocks have the rail - some

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:36.649 
rail lots of Glocks have the rail - some
don't<00:01:33.990> my<00:01:34.200> 26<00:01:34.920> doesn't<00:01:35.280> it's<00:01:35.520> too<00:01:35.700> small<00:01:35.939> but

if you've got a rail you may want to

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:40.190 
if you've got a rail you may want to

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:35.850 
using a your gun as a nightstand gun I

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:38.510 
using a your gun as a nightstand gun I
think<00:02:36.150> a<00:02:36.239> light<00:02:36.510> is<00:02:36.720> a<00:02:37.050> must<00:02:37.470> if<00:02:38.069> you're<00:02:38.310> using

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:38.520 
think a light is a must if you're using

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:40.640 
think a light is a must if you're using
as<00:02:38.760> an<00:02:38.880> everyday<00:02:39.150> carry<00:02:39.540> gun<00:02:39.780> well<00:02:40.140> then<00:02:40.380> you

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:40.650 
as an everyday carry gun well then you

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:42.050 
as an everyday carry gun well then you
need<00:02:40.860> to<00:02:40.980> decide<00:02:41.280> whether<00:02:41.459> or<00:02:41.580> not<00:02:41.700> you<00:02:41.880> want

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:42.060 
need to decide whether or not you want

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:44.630 
need to decide whether or not you want
to<00:02:42.150> worry<00:02:42.600> about<00:02:42.750> a<00:02:43.080> holster<00:02:43.650> that<00:02:43.860> can

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:44.640 
to worry about a holster that can

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:47.150 
to worry about a holster that can
support<00:02:44.910> a<00:02:45.030> light<00:02:45.209> or<00:02:45.420> whether<00:02:46.160> it's

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:47.160 
support a light or whether it's

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:49.520 
support a light or whether it's
comfortable<00:02:47.610> for<00:02:47.730> you<00:02:47.790> I<00:02:48.000> happen<00:02:48.510> to<00:02:48.690> I've<00:02:49.410> got

00:03:00.559 --> 00:03:00.569 
could go back and do it again I'd just

00:03:00.569 --> 00:03:02.780
