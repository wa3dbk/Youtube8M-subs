to<00:00:19.380> be<00:00:19.470> here<00:00:19.710> when<00:00:20.400> we<00:00:20.550> had<00:00:20.699> our<00:00:20.730> RV<00:00:21.090> inspected

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:21.750 
to be here when we had our RV inspected

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:23.150 
to be here when we had our RV inspected
they<00:00:21.900> did<00:00:22.080> a<00:00:22.109> leak<00:00:22.320> test<00:00:22.590> on<00:00:22.800> it<00:00:22.830> and<00:00:23.070> there

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:23.160 
they did a leak test on it and there

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:25.250 
they did a leak test on it and there
were<00:00:23.279> no<00:00:23.460> leaks<00:00:23.699> around<00:00:23.910> these<00:00:24.180> windows<00:00:24.660> so<00:00:24.990> in

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:25.260 
were no leaks around these windows so in

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:26.929 
were no leaks around these windows so in
my<00:00:25.410> mind<00:00:25.680> if<00:00:25.890> it<00:00:26.010> ain't<00:00:26.160> broke<00:00:26.400> don't<00:00:26.640> fix

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:26.939 
my mind if it ain't broke don't fix

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:29.359 
my mind if it ain't broke don't fix
absolutely<00:00:27.810> in<00:00:27.930> this<00:00:28.019> particular<00:00:28.320> case<00:00:28.740> leak

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:29.369 
absolutely in this particular case leak

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:30.710 
absolutely in this particular case leak
proof<00:00:29.609> is<00:00:29.880> much<00:00:29.939> more<00:00:30.330> important<00:00:30.630> than

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:30.720 
proof is much more important than

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:33.260 
proof is much more important than
appearance<00:00:31.109> and<00:00:31.430> appearance<00:00:32.430> is<00:00:32.640> what<00:00:33.180> we're

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:33.270 
appearance and appearance is what we're

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:34.970 
appearance and appearance is what we're
gonna<00:00:33.390> fix<00:00:33.660> with<00:00:33.899> this<00:00:34.140> right<00:00:34.440> absolutely

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:34.980 
gonna fix with this right absolutely

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:36.950 
gonna fix with this right absolutely
this<00:00:35.130> is<00:00:35.250> a<00:00:35.280> this<00:00:35.550> is<00:00:35.700> a<00:00:35.730> rock<00:00:36.000> guard<00:00:36.329> provided

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:36.960 
this is a this is a rock guard provided

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:39.290 
this is a this is a rock guard provided
by<00:00:37.140> Airstream<00:00:37.829> and<00:00:38.070> basically<00:00:38.670> what<00:00:38.879> we<00:00:39.000> do<00:00:39.149> we

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:39.300 
by Airstream and basically what we do we

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:41.240 
by Airstream and basically what we do we
cover<00:00:39.809> this<00:00:40.050> whole<00:00:40.260> window<00:00:40.620> assembly<00:00:41.100> all

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:41.250 
cover this whole window assembly all

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:43.580 
cover this whole window assembly all
three<00:00:41.550> pieces<00:00:41.790> of<00:00:42.149> this<00:00:42.300> window<00:00:42.600> assembly<00:00:43.050> so

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:43.590 
three pieces of this window assembly so

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:44.959 
three pieces of this window assembly so
when<00:00:43.770> you're<00:00:43.890> towing<00:00:44.100> the<00:00:44.309> vehicle<00:00:44.670> down<00:00:44.789> the

00:00:44.959 --> 00:00:44.969 
when you're towing the vehicle down the

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:46.700 
when you're towing the vehicle down the
road<00:00:45.210> rocks<00:00:45.870> that<00:00:46.079> are<00:00:46.230> picked<00:00:46.440> up<00:00:46.590> from

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
road rocks that are picked up from

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:48.920 
road rocks that are picked up from
behind<00:00:46.920> the<00:00:47.160> tow<00:00:47.370> vehicle<00:00:47.789> won't<00:00:48.360> crack<00:00:48.690> this

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:48.930 
behind the tow vehicle won't crack this

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:50.209 
behind the tow vehicle won't crack this
particular<00:00:49.260> window<00:00:49.559> and<00:00:49.739> that's<00:00:49.860> probably

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219 
particular window and that's probably

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:51.590 
particular window and that's probably
what<00:00:50.399> happened<00:00:50.520> originally<00:00:51.090> that's<00:00:51.180> why<00:00:51.390> this

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600 
what happened originally that's why this

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:53.360 
what happened originally that's why this
window<00:00:51.870> has<00:00:52.050> been<00:00:52.230> replaced<00:00:52.590> and<00:00:52.980> I've<00:00:53.219> seen

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
window has been replaced and I've seen

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:54.590 
window has been replaced and I've seen
them<00:00:53.520> on<00:00:53.579> the<00:00:53.640> new<00:00:53.789> air<00:00:53.940> streams<00:00:54.300> they<00:00:54.449> look

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 
them on the new air streams they look

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:56.090 
them on the new air streams they look
fantastic<00:00:54.780> on<00:00:55.410> there<00:00:55.620> but<00:00:55.739> they're<00:00:55.860> also

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
fantastic on there but they're also

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:57.950 
fantastic on there but they're also
functional<00:00:56.579> that's<00:00:56.760> wonderful<00:00:57.300> so<00:00:57.719> what's

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 
functional that's wonderful so what's

00:00:57.960 --> 00:00:59.510 
functional that's wonderful so what's
the<00:00:58.079> first<00:00:58.199> step<00:00:58.350> in<00:00:58.649> putting<00:00:58.829> this<00:00:59.010> on<00:00:59.190> well<00:00:59.489> I

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520 
the first step in putting this on well I

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:00.830 
the first step in putting this on well I
think<00:00:59.670> the<00:00:59.879> easiest<00:00:59.910> way<00:01:00.210> to<00:01:00.329> go<00:01:00.480> about<00:01:00.629> this

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
think the easiest way to go about this

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:03.229 
think the easiest way to go about this
is<00:01:00.899> if<00:01:01.170> we<00:01:01.260> take<00:01:01.410> this<00:01:01.620> hinge<00:01:02.059> section<00:01:03.059> and

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 
is if we take this hinge section and

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:06.050 
is if we take this hinge section and
remove<00:01:03.930> this<00:01:04.199> pop<00:01:04.500> rivet<00:01:04.890> and<00:01:05.339> slide<00:01:05.760> the

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
remove this pop rivet and slide the

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:08.480 
remove this pop rivet and slide the
actual<00:01:06.540> rock<00:01:06.720> guard<00:01:07.080> off<00:01:07.320> of<00:01:07.530> the<00:01:07.650> hinge<00:01:07.950> then

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
actual rock guard off of the hinge then

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:11.390 
actual rock guard off of the hinge then
we<00:01:08.640> can<00:01:08.850> take<00:01:09.030> the<00:01:09.600> rail<00:01:09.840> itself<00:01:10.229> and<00:01:10.560> Center

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
we can take the rail itself and Center

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:13.340 
we can take the rail itself and Center
it<00:01:11.490> perfectly<00:01:11.939> then<00:01:12.450> we'll<00:01:12.659> slide<00:01:12.930> the<00:01:13.170> rock

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 
it perfectly then we'll slide the rock

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:14.840 
it perfectly then we'll slide the rock
guard<00:01:13.619> back<00:01:13.830> in<00:01:14.010> place<00:01:14.220> and<00:01:14.250> then<00:01:14.580> just<00:01:14.729> go

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
guard back in place and then just go

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:16.640 
guard back in place and then just go
from<00:01:15.000> there<00:01:15.210> that<00:01:15.659> makes<00:01:15.840> sense<00:01:16.110> let's<00:01:16.350> get<00:01:16.530> to

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:16.650 
from there that makes sense let's get to

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:17.950 
from there that makes sense let's get to
it<00:01:16.680> all<00:01:16.979> right

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:17.960 
it all right

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:21.320 
it all right
the<00:01:18.960> rivet<00:01:19.259> is<00:01:19.350> drilled<00:01:19.680> out<00:01:19.830> and<00:01:20.369> we<00:01:21.060> slide

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330 
the rivet is drilled out and we slide

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:25.910 
the rivet is drilled out and we slide
the<00:01:21.540> rail<00:01:21.720> out<00:01:24.229> the<00:01:25.229> easiest<00:01:25.470> thing<00:01:25.710> to<00:01:25.740> do

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920 
the rail out the easiest thing to do

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:27.710 
the rail out the easiest thing to do
Kevin<00:01:26.130> is<00:01:26.369> to<00:01:26.520> line<00:01:26.939> it<00:01:26.970> up<00:01:27.240> with<00:01:27.540> the

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720 
Kevin is to line it up with the

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:29.630 
Kevin is to line it up with the
Airstream<00:01:28.170> logo<00:01:28.500> that<00:01:28.650> you<00:01:28.710> see<00:01:28.829> here<00:01:29.430> and

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
Airstream logo that you see here and

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:31.310 
Airstream logo that you see here and
we'll<00:01:30.030> Center<00:01:30.420> it<00:01:30.540> and<00:01:30.720> then<00:01:30.930> what<00:01:31.049> we<00:01:31.140> have<00:01:31.170> to

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:31.320 
we'll Center it and then what we have to

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:33.560 
we'll Center it and then what we have to
do<00:01:31.409> is<00:01:31.500> pre-drill<00:01:32.100> this<00:01:32.310> rail<00:01:32.640> and<00:01:32.939> we'll<00:01:33.420> put

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570 
do is pre-drill this rail and we'll put

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:35.120 
do is pre-drill this rail and we'll put
