00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.589
 Hello friends, are you watching the project? 

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:06.779
 here erland and in this issue will tell you 

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:23.160
 about this here in the chamber light 

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:25.260
 so let's go screensaver for a start I 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:25.740
 I'll tell you why camera hours are needed 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:27.689
 light and 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:29.550
 Well, first of all they are needed when 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:31.740
 filming when he needs to light 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:34.050
 any object conditions low 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:35.850
 illumination whether it is night or evening and 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:36.780
 precisely due to its LEDs 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:39.480
 camera light 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:41.309
 perfect for video shooting but i 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:43.110
 I think we should start with what is common 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:45.450
 walked in set with this on chamber 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:48.090
 color let's say so make a small mini 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:54.120
 review of this camera light 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:55.800
 Friends went in the kit went like this 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:58.410
 Here is a black case in which actually 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:00.270
 is the whole set of this on chamber 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:02.760
 light well let's open it let's see 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:06.210
 what is there inside it is first 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:07.970
 queue we can see what it is in 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:11.520
 the first is the camera light itself 

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:13.650
 these are the LEDs by itself 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:16.290
 has a rather large size 15 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:19.170
 centimeters by 12 centimeters and by 6 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:22.380
 the width of such a camera light has a mass 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:24.479
 305 grams if I am not mistaken, well, I think 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:26.670
 probably on this all and actually what 

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:29.189
 just light light really not 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:32.220
 friends if you look even in the kit 

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:35.100
 also here in such a case here is the case itself 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:38.640
 actually included two such colors 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:41.100
 filter one filter is just white and 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:42.000
 another filter orange first filter 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:44.220
 white filter 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.540
 used to soften the light for 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:47.610
 to be able to reach 

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:49.799
 diffuse effect second filter 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:52.950
 orange is needed to 

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:54.659
 it was to make the colors let's say warm but 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:57.930
 Now I would like to say a little more about 

00:01:54.659 --> 00:02:00.020
 the very characteristics of this very color 

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:04.020
 illumination of such on chamber light 

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:06.119
 1050 lux color temperature from 3000 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:08.700
 Kelvin to 6000 Kelvin 

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:11.550
 for whom it is not clear 3000 Kelvin 

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:13.410
 cooler colors a6000 warmer 

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:15.750
 there is a compartment for 

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:17.310
 batteries by the way exactly to this 

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:18.420
 lantern to this model can 

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:21.660
 use not only 

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:22.920
 batteries of the usual type 2a here as well 

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:25.500
 batteries can be used 

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:26.820
 different there from sony from panasonika like 

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:29.550
 they don't need to be someone on the internet 

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:32.190
 standard, they also fit exactly to 

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:33.510
 this light is very very convenient 

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:35.790
 there is in other words you can refuse 

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:37.440
 completely off the batteries and buy one 

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:39.420
 such a big battery that will 

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:41.880
 here it is inserted exactly the same charge 

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:43.770
 and this is also more in my opinion more convenient than me 

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:45.660
 it seemed so further I instead 

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:47.370
 I will surely buy one battery 

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:49.260
 a large battery is likely even 

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:51.270
 high capacity here on the back 

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:53.700
 We can also see two buttons on the side. 

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:55.740
 this dimming and increasing 

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:56.760
 brightness and a button switch 

00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:59.280
 shutdown itself 

00:02:56.760 --> 00:03:01.200
 lantern well test button in order to 

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:03.480
 it was possible to determine the level of charge 

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:06.830
 press the power button and thereby 

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:10.500
 we light our on-camera light 

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:11.940
 so here he shines as we can 

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:15.770
 see pretty bright 

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:19.740
 sweaters really bright here with this button 

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:25.110
 minus reduce brightness try it 

00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:26.670
 make yes and true as we see brightness 

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:29.130
 decreases but still it is pretty 

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:33.260
 is in itself a bright well it 

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:36.720
 probably for no such straight night shooting 

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:39.480
 I did it again and this increase 

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:42.750
 brightness increases it well of course 

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:45.780
 we still test it in the dark among a 

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:49.230
 for now it's just that we just indulge 

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:49.950
 well and the button itself is testing here we are 

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:51.390
 pressed 

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:55.380
 It does not show what is now in 

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:57.000
 I'm charged on all three stripes 

00:03:55.380 --> 00:03:59.100
 You do not need to change the battery for a month 

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:02.220
 fully charged it is very very 

00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:04.050
 okay, turn off our lantern oh yeah 

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:05.810
 I forgot to add friends using here 

00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:08.790
 this shoe which is right on 

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:11.310
 the casing of this lantern using it 

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:14.010
 camera light can be attached by itself 

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:15.900
 the camera that basically and well is 

00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:18.000
 distinctive feature of this from whom 

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:20.250
 another lantern I do not know economic 

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:23.580
 homemade ie it is very very comfortable 

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:24.120
 but a shoe named after my camera and such 

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:25.520
 that's the way 

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:28.580
 wait a second 

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:31.310
 and that's how I fixed it 

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:33.080
 Shoe Shoe Once again I repeat the camera to 

00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:36.199
 on to the peaceful light now this part 

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:38.509
 just enters the camera and actually 

00:04:36.199 --> 00:04:44.569
 he will stand on it what time am i and 

00:04:38.509 --> 00:04:46.909
 I will make friends now and for one more 

00:04:44.569 --> 00:04:48.830
 test came out special in the staircase here 

00:04:46.909 --> 00:04:50.750
 also almost nothing is visible but 

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:53.300
 there you can see understand here specifically 

00:04:50.750 --> 00:04:56.030
 I'll try to light such a dark corner too 

00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:58.130
 my camera light and everything I have 

00:04:56.030 --> 00:05:02.449
 it turns out everything is now visible everything is bright 

00:04:58.130 --> 00:05:05.449
 well without him as you can see almost that 

00:05:02.449 --> 00:05:06.530
 seen anything so to say but that's all 

00:05:05.449 --> 00:05:12.789
 flashing lights 

00:05:06.530 --> 00:05:16.270
 and now friends i am again in complete darkness 

00:05:12.789 --> 00:05:19.039
 I will test two filters that 

00:05:16.270 --> 00:05:21.500
 attached in the kit we did not see 

00:05:19.039 --> 00:05:25.539
 so I probably will immediately put my 

00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:31.069
 camera light on the camera into the socket and 

00:05:25.539 --> 00:05:33.280
 kindle it like this but now all he can see 

00:05:31.069 --> 00:05:35.810
 blinding my eyes a little bit 

00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:38.659
 here are these two now filter i will 

00:05:35.810 --> 00:05:41.440
 test right in front of you first 

00:05:38.659 --> 00:05:47.270
 filter this is again white scattering 

00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:49.759
 try here I set my first 

00:05:47.270 --> 00:05:51.650
 filter white diffusing and in fact 

00:05:49.759 --> 00:05:56.000
 Now I had become some sort of light 

00:05:51.650 --> 00:05:59.240
 all the more so if I do not know well, and seeded to 

00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:01.310
 Well, I do not know probably from the filter for a reason 

00:05:59.240 --> 00:06:03.830
 in this set he also had to 

00:06:01.310 --> 00:06:06.740
 a few of its function here night 

00:06:03.830 --> 00:06:10.850
 try before another yellow or 

00:06:06.740 --> 00:06:14.420
 orange here friends i put 

00:06:10.850 --> 00:06:16.460
 Now the filter is already yellow as you 

00:06:14.420 --> 00:06:20.540
 push the colors have become more like that 

00:06:16.460 --> 00:06:23.330
 well, yellow warmer by themselves 

00:06:20.540 --> 00:06:25.070
 Compared to that filter like this, friends 

00:06:23.330 --> 00:06:27.380
 on this basically release coming to 

00:06:25.070 --> 00:06:29.300
 the end I do not know how it turned out 

00:06:27.380 --> 00:06:30.860
 generally informative but it seems to me 

00:06:29.300 --> 00:06:32.810
 quite informative in and of itself 

00:06:30.860 --> 00:06:34.910
 if this release was interesting to you 

00:06:32.810 --> 00:06:37.130
 then be sure to subscribe to my 

00:06:34.910 --> 00:06:38.900
 channel down here and also put 

00:06:37.130 --> 00:06:39.800
 thumb up for my new 

00:06:38.900 --> 00:06:42.370
 camera light 

00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:45.370
 as well as just for a cold thumbs up 

00:06:42.370 --> 00:06:45.370
 happy
