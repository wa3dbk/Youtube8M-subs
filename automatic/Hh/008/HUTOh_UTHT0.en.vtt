 I commented previously is not the same 

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:56.450
 Go, for example, to a South American country 

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:58.580
 and do trekking here for example in 

00:00:56.450 --> 00:01:00.830
 Spain then we will join 

00:00:58.580 --> 00:01:03.020
 with what we need there will be minimal things 

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:05.269
 that all were common as for example 

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:07.939
 the disinfectant alcohol 

00:01:05.269 --> 00:01:10.100
 and back scissors that well, that will be 

00:01:07.939 --> 00:01:11.240
 common in everything but good because every 

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:13.610
 one gets his booty and both for 

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:15.390

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:46.200
