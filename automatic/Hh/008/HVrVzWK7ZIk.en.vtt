with the catch and that's actually going
to<00:02:05.700> be<00:02:05.880> to<00:02:06.210> win<00:02:06.479> with<00:02:07.260> the<00:02:07.440> catch<00:02:07.680> and<00:02:07.920> I

00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:08.130 
to be to win with the catch and I

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:09.290 
to be to win with the catch and I
thought<00:02:08.340> for<00:02:08.520> a<00:02:08.580> minute<00:02:08.790> that<00:02:08.940> Brewer

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:09.300 
thought for a minute that Brewer

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:12.920 
thought for a minute that Brewer
overthrew<00:02:09.899> him<00:02:10.050> but<00:02:10.649> the<00:02:10.830> win<00:02:11.570> able<00:02:12.570> to<00:02:12.720> make

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:12.930 
overthrew him but the win able to make

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:14.860 
overthrew him but the win able to make

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:14.870 
that catch and run underneath the ball

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:17.660 
that catch and run underneath the ball
but<00:02:15.870> what<00:02:15.989> is<00:02:16.110> that<00:02:16.230> a<00:02:16.260> 60<00:02:16.830> yard<00:02:17.010> strike<00:02:17.310> for<00:02:17.640> a

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:17.670 
but what is that a 60 yard strike for a

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:18.320 
but what is that a 60 yard strike for a
touchdown
