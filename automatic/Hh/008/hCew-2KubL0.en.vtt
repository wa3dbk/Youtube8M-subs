right<00:07:08.130> I<00:07:08.340> mean<00:07:08.670> I<00:07:08.760> think<00:07:08.790> this<00:07:09.090> is<00:07:09.210> a<00:07:09.240> very

00:07:09.290 --> 00:07:09.300 
right I mean I think this is a very

00:07:09.300 --> 00:07:11.240 
right I mean I think this is a very
resilient<00:07:09.720> group<00:07:09.900> that<00:07:10.140> we<00:07:10.200> have<00:07:10.380> you<00:07:11.160> know

00:07:11.240 --> 00:07:11.250 
resilient group that we have you know

00:07:11.250 --> 00:07:12.680 
resilient group that we have you know
all<00:07:11.370> season<00:07:11.520> long<00:07:11.790> you<00:07:12.060> know<00:07:12.150> we've<00:07:12.480> dealt

00:07:12.680 --> 00:07:12.690 
all season long you know we've dealt

00:07:12.690 --> 00:07:14.510 
all season long you know we've dealt
with<00:07:12.750> some<00:07:12.930> difficult<00:07:13.380> circumstances<00:07:13.890> from

00:07:14.510 --> 00:07:14.520 
with some difficult circumstances from

00:07:14.520 --> 00:07:17.720 
with some difficult circumstances from
guys<00:07:14.700> getting<00:07:15.030> hurt<00:07:15.680> for<00:07:16.680> example<00:07:17.040> just<00:07:17.400> the

00:07:17.720 --> 00:07:17.730 
guys getting hurt for example just the

00:07:17.730 --> 00:07:19.280 
guys getting hurt for example just the
overtime<00:07:18.060> games<00:07:18.270> that<00:07:18.390> we've<00:07:18.480> had<00:07:18.600> I<00:07:18.810> think<00:07:19.230> we

00:07:19.280 --> 00:07:19.290 
overtime games that we've had I think we

00:07:19.290 --> 00:07:21.100 
overtime games that we've had I think we
bounced<00:07:19.530> back<00:07:19.740> really<00:07:19.800> well<00:07:20.160> from<00:07:20.280> that

00:07:21.100 --> 00:07:21.110 
bounced back really well from that

00:07:21.110 --> 00:07:22.760 
bounced back really well from that
