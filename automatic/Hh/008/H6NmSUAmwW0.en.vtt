have to remove the interior panel and

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:42.569 
have to remove the interior panel and
most<00:00:41.530> of<00:00:41.620> the<00:00:41.680> time<00:00:41.829> the<00:00:41.950> interior<00:00:42.250> panel<00:00:42.460> just

00:00:42.569 --> 00:00:42.579 
most of the time the interior panel just

00:00:42.579 --> 00:00:44.490 
most of the time the interior panel just
held<00:00:42.790> on<00:00:42.910> by<00:00:43.030> some<00:00:43.239> clips<00:00:43.540> unfortunately<00:00:44.320> this

00:00:44.490 --> 00:00:44.500 
held on by some clips unfortunately this

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:46.709 
held on by some clips unfortunately this
one<00:00:44.710> doesn't<00:00:44.860> have<00:00:45.010> a<00:00:45.130> so<00:00:45.610> fortunately<00:00:46.450> for<00:00:46.630> me

00:00:46.709 --> 00:00:46.719 
one doesn't have a so fortunately for me

00:00:46.719 --> 00:00:51.330 
one doesn't have a so fortunately for me
this<00:00:46.870> one<00:00:47.020> it<00:00:47.140> doesn't<00:00:47.380> have<00:00:47.530> any<00:00:50.160> the<00:00:51.160> two

00:00:51.330 --> 00:00:51.340 
this one it doesn't have any the two

this one it doesn't have any the two
fourteen<00:00:51.670> millimeter<00:00:51.820> bolts<00:00:52.360> are<00:00:52.480> underneath

00:00:52.889 --> 00:00:52.899 
fourteen millimeter bolts are underneath

00:00:52.899 --> 00:00:54.869 
fourteen millimeter bolts are underneath
this<00:00:53.200> filler<00:00:53.590> pipe<00:00:53.890> so<00:00:54.160> what<00:00:54.399> we<00:00:54.489> do<00:00:54.700> is<00:00:54.789> we're

00:00:54.869 --> 00:00:54.879 
this filler pipe so what we do is we're

00:00:54.879 --> 00:00:56.100 
this filler pipe so what we do is we're
going<00:00:54.969> to<00:00:55.059> remove<00:00:55.450> the<00:00:55.660> three<00:00:55.899> eight

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:56.110 
going to remove the three eight

00:00:56.110 --> 00:00:58.680 
going to remove the three eight
millimeter<00:00:56.559> and<00:00:57.219> that<00:00:57.399> that's<00:00:57.700> attached<00:00:58.480> this

00:00:58.680 --> 00:00:58.690 
millimeter and that that's attached this

00:00:58.690 --> 00:00:59.910 
millimeter and that that's attached this
Phillip<00:00:58.989> pipe<00:00:59.170> and<00:00:59.350> then<00:00:59.469> we<00:00:59.530> can<00:00:59.680> move<00:00:59.770> the

00:00:59.910 --> 00:00:59.920 
Phillip pipe and then we can move the

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:02.369 
Phillip pipe and then we can move the
Phillip<00:01:00.219> i'p<00:01:00.370> out<00:01:00.550> of<00:01:00.700> the<00:01:00.789> way<00:01:00.940> and<00:01:01.180> this<00:01:01.930> 1:10

00:01:02.369 --> 00:01:02.379 
Phillip i'p out of the way and this 1:10

00:01:02.379 --> 00:01:11.609 
Phillip i'p out of the way and this 1:10
also<00:01:09.539> with<00:01:10.539> a<00:01:10.569> filler<00:01:10.840> pipe<00:01:11.079> out<00:01:11.229> of<00:01:11.259> the<00:01:11.469> way

00:01:11.609 --> 00:01:11.619 
also with a filler pipe out of the way

00:01:11.619 --> 00:01:12.929 
also with a filler pipe out of the way
we<00:01:11.770> could<00:01:11.920> access<00:01:12.100> the<00:01:12.399> two<00:01:12.549> fourteen

00:01:12.929 --> 00:01:12.939 
we could access the two fourteen

00:01:12.939 --> 00:01:24.569 
we could access the two fourteen
millimeter<00:01:13.179> nut<00:01:13.779> on<00:01:13.959> top<00:01:13.990> of<00:01:14.289> the<00:01:14.409> shock<00:01:23.579> now

00:01:24.569 --> 00:01:24.579 
millimeter nut on top of the shock now

00:01:24.579 --> 00:01:30.269 
millimeter nut on top of the shock now
we<00:01:24.639> can<00:01:24.819> remove<00:01:24.939> the<00:01:25.179> shock<00:01:27.630> as<00:01:28.920> you<00:01:29.920> can<00:01:30.069> tell

00:01:30.269 --> 00:01:30.279 
we can remove the shock as you can tell

00:01:30.279 --> 00:01:32.940 
we can remove the shock as you can tell
with<00:01:30.429> the<00:01:30.579> two<00:01:30.789> shocks<00:01:31.060> side-by-side<00:01:31.719> the<00:01:32.020> kW

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:32.950 
with the two shocks side-by-side the kW

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:34.139 
with the two shocks side-by-side the kW
shock<00:01:33.130> is<00:01:33.219> definitely<00:01:33.579> more<00:01:33.669> much<00:01:33.969> more

00:01:34.139 --> 00:01:34.149 
shock is definitely more much more

00:01:34.149 --> 00:01:35.609 
shock is definitely more much more
compact<00:01:34.539> it<00:01:34.779> uses<00:01:35.049> a<00:01:35.109> smaller<00:01:35.409> diameter

00:01:35.609 --> 00:01:35.619 
compact it uses a smaller diameter

00:01:35.619 --> 00:01:38.129 
compact it uses a smaller diameter
spring<00:01:36.159> and<00:01:36.459> also<00:01:37.119> uses<00:01:37.509> a<00:01:37.539> helper<00:01:37.899> spring

00:01:38.129 --> 00:01:38.139 
spring and also uses a helper spring

00:01:38.139 --> 00:01:40.289 
spring and also uses a helper spring
compared<00:01:38.529> to<00:01:38.649> a<00:01:38.679> single<00:01:38.979> spring<00:01:39.789> design<00:01:39.999> of

00:01:40.289 --> 00:01:40.299 
compared to a single spring design of

00:01:40.299 --> 00:01:42.330 
compared to a single spring design of
the<00:01:40.389> factory<00:01:40.869> as<00:01:41.049> you<00:01:41.649> can<00:01:41.770> see<00:01:41.950> they're<00:01:42.130> still

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:42.340 
the factory as you can see they're still

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:44.789 
the factory as you can see they're still
external<00:01:43.090> reservoirs<00:01:43.509> on<00:01:43.689> both<00:01:43.869> of<00:01:44.049> them<00:01:44.200> but

00:01:44.789 --> 00:01:44.799 
external reservoirs on both of them but

00:01:44.799 --> 00:01:46.559 
external reservoirs on both of them but
the<00:01:44.859> kW<00:01:45.399> shock<00:01:45.609> is<00:01:45.729> actually<00:01:45.999> a<00:01:46.029> threaded<00:01:46.389> body

00:01:46.559 --> 00:01:46.569 
the kW shock is actually a threaded body

00:01:46.569 --> 00:01:48.510 
the kW shock is actually a threaded body
so<00:01:46.899> that<00:01:46.929> way<00:01:47.259> you<00:01:47.319> can<00:01:47.649> actually<00:01:47.770> raise<00:01:48.159> and

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:48.520 
so that way you can actually raise and

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:51.149 
so that way you can actually raise and
lower<00:01:48.549> the<00:01:48.849> vehicle<00:01:48.969> by<00:01:49.329> moving<00:01:49.929> the<00:01:50.200> perch<00:01:50.979> of

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:51.159 
lower the vehicle by moving the perch of

00:01:51.159 --> 00:01:54.899 
lower the vehicle by moving the perch of
the<00:01:51.279> of<00:01:51.880> the<00:01:52.090> shock<00:01:52.299> and<00:01:52.599> then<00:01:53.200> also<00:01:53.439> as<00:01:53.979> you

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:54.909 
the of the shock and then also as you

00:01:54.909 --> 00:01:57.539 
the of the shock and then also as you
can<00:01:55.060> see<00:01:55.380> the<00:01:56.380> kW<00:01:56.889> shock<00:01:57.099> comes<00:01:57.369> with<00:01:57.489> a

00:01:57.539 --> 00:01:57.549 
can see the kW shock comes with a

00:01:57.549 --> 00:01:59.129 
can see the kW shock comes with a
brand-new<00:01:57.880> pillow<00:01:58.090> ball<00:01:58.329> mount<00:01:58.539> compared<00:01:59.020> to

00:01:59.129 --> 00:01:59.139 
brand-new pillow ball mount compared to

00:01:59.139 --> 00:02:00.330 
brand-new pillow ball mount compared to
the<00:01:59.229> factory<00:01:59.529> with<00:01:59.649> this<00:01:59.799> actually<00:02:00.130> rubber

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:00.340 
the factory with this actually rubber

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:01.889 
the factory with this actually rubber
and<00:02:00.639> there's<00:02:01.149> a<00:02:01.209> lot<00:02:01.389> less<00:02:01.569> deflection

00:02:01.889 --> 00:02:01.899 
and there's a lot less deflection

00:02:01.899 --> 00:02:03.569 
and there's a lot less deflection
obviously<00:02:02.469> there's<00:02:02.679> no<00:02:02.829> deflection<00:02:03.130> with<00:02:03.489> the

00:02:03.569 --> 00:02:03.579 
obviously there's no deflection with the

00:02:03.579 --> 00:02:06.389 
obviously there's no deflection with the
kW<00:02:04.119> top<00:02:05.020> mount<00:02:05.229> versus<00:02:05.649> the<00:02:05.799> factory<00:02:06.219> cup

00:02:06.389 --> 00:02:06.399 
kW top mount versus the factory cup

00:02:06.399 --> 00:02:07.830 
kW top mount versus the factory cup
mount<00:02:06.609> would<00:02:06.939> obviously<00:02:07.299> has<00:02:07.539> a<00:02:07.569> lot<00:02:07.689> of

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:07.840 
mount would obviously has a lot of

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:11.940 
mount would obviously has a lot of
compliance<00:02:08.619> in<00:02:08.800> it

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:11.950 

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:14.380 

another<00:02:12.950> aspect<00:02:13.190> of<00:02:13.550> the<00:02:13.640> K<00:02:13.760> double<00:02:14.000> shock<00:02:14.180> I

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:14.390 
another aspect of the K double shock I

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:15.610 
another aspect of the K double shock I
see<00:02:14.690> is<00:02:14.780> the<00:02:14.900> fact<00:02:15.020> that<00:02:15.110> you<00:02:15.230> can<00:02:15.380> adjust

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:15.620 
see is the fact that you can adjust

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:18.070 
see is the fact that you can adjust
compression<00:02:16.430> and<00:02:16.580> rebound<00:02:17.120> on<00:02:17.540> the<00:02:17.630> shock<00:02:17.870> and

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:18.080 
compression and rebound on the shock and

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:20.110 
compression and rebound on the shock and
this<00:02:18.560> will<00:02:18.860> change<00:02:18.890> the<00:02:19.190> characteristics<00:02:20.000> of

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:20.120 
this will change the characteristics of

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:21.520 
this will change the characteristics of
the<00:02:20.270> shock<00:02:20.450> especially<00:02:20.870> at<00:02:20.960> the<00:02:21.080> track<00:02:21.320> work

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:21.530 
the shock especially at the track work

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:23.170 
the shock especially at the track work
you<00:02:22.010> can<00:02:22.160> actually<00:02:22.340> adjust<00:02:22.550> for<00:02:22.940> more

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:23.180 
you can actually adjust for more

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:25.120 
you can actually adjust for more
compression<00:02:23.750> or<00:02:23.840> rebound<00:02:24.080> depending<00:02:24.500> on<00:02:24.590> the

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:25.130 
compression or rebound depending on the

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:26.950 
compression or rebound depending on the
driver<00:02:25.400> preference<00:02:26.180> or<00:02:26.390> also<00:02:26.690> the

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:26.960 
driver preference or also the

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:29.020 
driver preference or also the
modifications<00:02:27.920> on<00:02:28.040> the<00:02:28.070> vehicle<00:02:28.550> for

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:29.030 
modifications on the vehicle for

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:30.670 
modifications on the vehicle for
instance<00:02:29.450> on<00:02:29.600> a<00:02:29.660> vehicle<00:02:29.990> that<00:02:30.230> has<00:02:30.350> a<00:02:30.380> wing

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:30.680 
instance on a vehicle that has a wing

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:32.980 
instance on a vehicle that has a wing
you<00:02:30.830> probably<00:02:31.160> use<00:02:31.340> less<00:02:31.580> rebound<00:02:32.570> because<00:02:32.720> of

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:32.990 
you probably use less rebound because of

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:34.300 
you probably use less rebound because of
back<00:02:33.200> that<00:02:33.230> the<00:02:33.590> wind<00:02:33.770> is<00:02:33.890> actually<00:02:33.980> going<00:02:34.220> to

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:34.310 
back that the wind is actually going to

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:37.330 
back that the wind is actually going to
keep<00:02:34.430> the<00:02:34.580> vehicle<00:02:34.940> more<00:02:35.600> firmly<00:02:35.900> planted<00:02:36.470> so

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:37.340 
keep the vehicle more firmly planted so

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:38.560 
keep the vehicle more firmly planted so
what<00:02:37.580> we're<00:02:37.700> gonna<00:02:37.790> do<00:02:38.030> now<00:02:38.210> is<00:02:38.240> we're<00:02:38.480> going

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:38.570 
what we're gonna do now is we're going

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:41.410 
what we're gonna do now is we're going
to<00:02:38.630> be<00:02:38.720> installing<00:02:39.110> the<00:02:39.470> new<00:02:40.040> kW<00:02:40.940> shock<00:02:41.150> back

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:41.420 
to be installing the new kW shock back

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:43.540 
to be installing the new kW shock back
into<00:02:41.750> the<00:02:41.840> vehicle<00:02:41.960> and<00:02:42.620> obviously<00:02:43.250> there's

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:43.550 
into the vehicle and obviously there's

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:46.360 
into the vehicle and obviously there's
just<00:02:43.940> a<00:02:44.030> reverse<00:02:44.270> order<00:02:44.540> of<00:02:44.720> the<00:02:44.870> removal<00:02:45.590> it's

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:46.370 
just a reverse order of the removal it's

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:55.960 
just a reverse order of the removal it's
gonna<00:02:46.490> slide<00:02:46.790> it<00:02:46.970> into<00:02:47.120> this<00:02:47.360> slot<00:02:48.020> and<00:02:54.970> then

00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:55.970 
gonna slide it into this slot and then

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:57.670 
gonna slide it into this slot and then
we're<00:02:56.090> gonna<00:02:56.180> put<00:02:56.420> the<00:02:56.540> two<00:02:56.870> nuts<00:02:57.230> and<00:02:57.440> bolts

00:02:57.670 --> 00:02:57.680 
we're gonna put the two nuts and bolts

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:01.300 
we're gonna put the two nuts and bolts
on<00:02:57.860> the<00:02:57.950> top<00:02:57.980> our<00:02:58.760> two<00:02:59.540> nuts<00:02:59.780> and<00:03:00.590> two<00:03:00.920> washers

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:01.310 
on the top our two nuts and two washers

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:14.440 
on the top our two nuts and two washers
on<00:03:01.520> top<00:03:05.770> the<00:03:06.770> bottom<00:03:06.920> bolt<00:03:13.180> so<00:03:14.180> we'll<00:03:14.330> be

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:14.450 
on top the bottom bolt so we'll be

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:17.080 
on top the bottom bolt so we'll be
talking<00:03:14.630> the<00:03:14.930> top<00:03:15.170> shock<00:03:16.130> bolts<00:03:16.430> to<00:03:16.580> 36

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:17.090 
talking the top shock bolts to 36

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:24.310 
talking the top shock bolts to 36
foot-pounds<00:03:22.450> where<00:03:23.450> the<00:03:23.540> shock<00:03:23.720> bolts<00:03:24.020> tight

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:24.320

now<00:03:24.620> we're<00:03:25.100> gonna<00:03:25.220> put<00:03:25.520> the<00:03:25.550> filler<00:03:25.820> neck<00:03:25.910> back

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:26.270 
now we're gonna put the filler neck back

00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:30.010 
now we're gonna put the filler neck back
into<00:03:26.540> this<00:03:26.600> place<00:03:28.420> like<00:03:29.420> the<00:03:29.630> rear<00:03:29.810> we're

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:30.020 
into this place like the rear we're

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:31.420 
into this place like the rear we're
gonna<00:03:30.110> remove<00:03:30.440> the<00:03:30.500> wheel<00:03:30.710> first<00:03:30.980> so<00:03:31.190> we<00:03:31.280> could

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:31.430 
gonna remove the wheel first so we could

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:34.950 
gonna remove the wheel first so we could
get<00:03:31.550> access<00:03:31.730> to<00:03:31.970> all<00:03:32.150> the<00:03:32.270> suspension<00:03:32.630> bolts

compared<00:03:35.960> to<00:03:36.080> the<00:03:36.170> rear<00:03:36.380> the<00:03:36.650> front<00:03:37.250> requires

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:37.640 
compared to the rear the front requires

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:39.430 
compared to the rear the front requires
a<00:03:37.730> few<00:03:38.090> more<00:03:38.360> extra<00:03:38.630> bolts<00:03:38.930> to<00:03:38.990> be<00:03:39.080> removed

00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:53.230 
now the shock you should come out there

00:04:53.230 --> 00:04:56.340 
now the shock you should come out there
you<00:04:53.380> go<00:04:54.090> here's<00:04:55.090> a<00:04:55.180> front<00:04:55.480> shock<00:04:55.690> comparison

00:04:56.340 --> 00:04:56.350 
you go here's a front shock comparison

00:04:56.350 --> 00:04:58.140 
you go here's a front shock comparison
as<00:04:56.500> you<00:04:56.890> can<00:04:57.010> see<00:04:57.190> the<00:04:57.340> main<00:04:57.490> difference<00:04:57.520> is

00:04:58.140 --> 00:04:58.150 
as you can see the main difference is

00:04:58.150 --> 00:05:00.420 
as you can see the main difference is
the<00:04:58.600> external<00:04:58.960> reservoir<00:04:59.440> that<00:04:59.590> on<00:04:59.860> the<00:05:00.250> key

00:05:00.420 --> 00:05:00.430 
the external reservoir that on the key

00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:02.040 
the external reservoir that on the key
that<00:05:00.580> we<00:05:00.669> shot<00:05:00.880> unlike<00:05:01.300> the<00:05:01.450> factory<00:05:01.840> shock

00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:02.050 
that we shot unlike the factory shock

00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:06.750 
that we shot unlike the factory shock
and<00:05:02.850> fact<00:05:03.850> that<00:05:04.270> on<00:05:04.540> the<00:05:05.110> factory<00:05:05.620> shock<00:05:06.520> you

00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:06.760 
and fact that on the factory shock you

00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:08.430 
and fact that on the factory shock you
notice<00:05:07.060> that<00:05:07.180> there's<00:05:07.390> a<00:05:07.450> nut<00:05:07.750> welded<00:05:08.260> onto

00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:08.440 
notice that there's a nut welded onto

00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:11.250 
notice that there's a nut welded onto
the<00:05:08.620> brake<00:05:08.919> line<00:05:09.130> or<00:05:09.669> the<00:05:09.760> brake<00:05:09.880> line<00:05:10.090> the<00:05:10.720> kW

00:05:11.250 --> 00:05:11.260 
the brake line or the brake line the kW

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:12.960 
the brake line or the brake line the kW
one<00:05:11.350> does<00:05:11.590> not<00:05:11.830> have<00:05:12.070> one<00:05:12.310> so<00:05:12.460> you<00:05:12.520> have<00:05:12.820> to

00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:12.970 
one does not have one so you have to

00:05:12.970 --> 00:05:15.690 
one does not have one so you have to
supply<00:05:13.240> your<00:05:13.480> own<00:05:13.510> m6<00:05:14.290> nut<00:05:14.380> that<00:05:15.220> you<00:05:15.340> can<00:05:15.490> find

00:05:15.690 --> 00:05:15.700 
supply your own m6 nut that you can find

00:05:15.700 --> 00:05:17.040

from any local hardware store or home
depot<00:05:17.560> or<00:05:17.590> lowes<00:05:17.860> so<00:05:18.190> that's<00:05:18.730> one<00:05:18.940> thing<00:05:19.060> that

00:05:19.230 --> 00:05:19.240 
depot or lowes so that's one thing that

00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:21.630 
depot or lowes so that's one thing that
does<00:05:19.570> not<00:05:19.750> come<00:05:19.930> with<00:05:20.080> it<00:05:20.230> they<00:05:20.710> do<00:05:20.770> come<00:05:21.520> with
