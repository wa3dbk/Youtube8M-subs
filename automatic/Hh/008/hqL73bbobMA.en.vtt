00:00:01.370 --> 00:00:04.120
 to me 

00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:12.110
 hi how are you today we are going to make a 

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:14.240
 little explanation of how the 

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:18.020
 server commander the remote unit for 

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:20.000
 control deposit classes 

00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:22.190
 or if voice is a brand that there is love 

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.900
 I have four units of them are 

00:00:22.190 --> 00:00:25.400
 fantastic and have an attention to 

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:27.920
 great customer of a quality 

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:30.710
 very good construction but at the time of 

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:33.380
 build this junk really have not 

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:35.920
 given the best explanations and it's not 

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:39.350
 the most intuitive machine in the world 

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:41.240
 it works it works well once you 

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:44.330
 you pass the learning curve and that 

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:45.770
 you learn to make artificial being a 

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:48.020
 prepare it to work with your 

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:50.840
 lights but really get to two points 

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:53.390
 a little bit complicated that the advantage is 

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:56.630
 that once you have it works with 

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:59.180
 up to 16 lights and with different groups 

00:00:56.630 --> 00:01:02.210
 they will destine spectacular cities so much 

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:03.920
 in studio as outdoors and you have 

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:05.869
 all controls including lights 

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:08.270
 of modeling that you can have in the panel 

00:01:05.869 --> 00:01:09.800
 back of this view directly what 

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:12.010
 only thing you have to do is 

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:14.560
 connected to the camera 

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:16.780
 it adapts to the hatzius of the camera what 

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:18.730
 You can leave to bother you less or 

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:21.850
 more to go working and you only have two 

00:01:18.730 --> 00:01:23.560
 joysticks so that to handle all 

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:26.320
 the all the ingredients of all the 

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:28.300
 Flash components we will prepare 

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:31.640
 it will be easier to explain a little bit 

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:33.979
 how it works we started already 

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:38.600
 well here you see the panel in this case the 

00:01:33.979 --> 00:01:41.360
 plane saint 640 and here you see the panel of the 

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:45.260
 0.2 which is the one that we are going to ride with him 

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:46.490
 in the camera the problem I think is that 

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:48.590
 for most of us what 

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:50.810
 we want is a solution precisely to 

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:52.940
 remote is a solution that allows us 

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:54.409
 handle them out of the box to 

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:57.170
 when flash and automatically start 

00:01:54.409 --> 00:01:59.780
 to work not functions and possible not 

00:01:57.170 --> 00:02:02.150
 they give us many many indications or 

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:03.560
 they are not very good to know how how 

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:06.410
 make these two pieces work 

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:08.630
 together in this case he will be more 

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:11.630
 simple is simply to know that 

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:14.870
 we have two menus or two joysticks the one 

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:17.300
 the left will work for us 

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:19.280
 give us the amount of flash power 

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:21.140
 and then in this case we see here that 

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:24.050
 we have channel 1 just like we have here 

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:26.090
 channel 1 and the unit is already synchronized 

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:28.700
 this is the most important step we have 

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:29.780
 bird we have the 26 40 and then what 

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:31.490
 only we have to do is go for 

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:33.860
 above 

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:36.230
 or down to give them more or less 

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:38.180
 power 

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:40.310
 once we have lowered it reflects 

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:43.330
 also directly in the racks and 

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:47.060
 we go up a little bit we go up and it reflects 

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:48.610
 in this case the menu of the xxiv of the 

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:51.440
 right happens to us through the 

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:53.510
 different configuration menus so we 

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:56.390
 come on let's go to modeling and there 

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:59.480
 we can therefore have more power in 

00:02:56.390 --> 00:03:00.739
 the modeling luther pretty much 

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:02.329
 power 

00:03:00.739 --> 00:03:06.319
 we can select what we can change 

00:03:02.329 --> 00:03:09.049
 light to light or all the lights hit 

00:03:06.319 --> 00:03:10.730
 one and then we go here and that's the 

00:03:09.049 --> 00:03:12.440
 most important part here is where 

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:13.400
 configures practically everything but what 

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:15.620
 first thing we should do is 

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:17.299
 synchronize the remote with the flash with 

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:19.700
 the unit for that we're going to open 

00:03:17.299 --> 00:03:20.750
 memory and once we're in open of 

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:22.849
 honor and we have to make sure that 

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:24.140
 we are working on channel 1 which is 

00:03:22.849 --> 00:03:25.400
 the same channel that we have here or in 

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:26.920
 any channel but that is the same 

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:29.250
 channel of light 

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:31.989
 asks us to synchronize the cybercommand 

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:34.569
 from the studio lights we tell them 

00:03:31.989 --> 00:03:36.760
 that keeps pressing opening and has already 

00:03:34.569 --> 00:03:38.470
 finished once we've done that he 

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:40.989
 it will automatically find us if 

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:43.030
 We are using of course to know if we 

00:03:40.989 --> 00:03:44.680
 will find light this light or so many 

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:46.180
 lights as we have a new study already 

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:47.800
 From there we are going to say when and 

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:50.260
 are all these are your lights and are 

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:52.330
 all in one channel or we can go to each 

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:54.190
 channel and put each light in a channel 

00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:56.710
 different to tell you that you find them 

00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:59.200
 from here we go 

00:03:56.710 --> 00:04:00.970
 we can go then 

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:03.790
 to the second most important menu that are 

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:04.360
 the settings of each unit in the mode 

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:05.830
 of modeling 

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:07.440
 we can tell him that the light is always 

00:04:05.830 --> 00:04:11.280
 full 

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:14.040
 that alÃ¡ tracking that change it or have it 

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:16.110
 off we can tell you that the unit 

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:17.820
 is up and running all the time is in 

00:04:16.110 --> 00:04:21.109
 standby we read beyond the control 

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:22.939
 we can say give an indicator to 

00:04:21.109 --> 00:04:24.889
 the recycling of light in this case to me 

00:04:22.939 --> 00:04:27.250
 I like the audio and we can tell you if 

00:04:24.889 --> 00:04:29.330
 we want to be like a slave or not 

00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:32.479
 we can also change the color mode 

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:34.310
 to make sure we have the color 

00:04:32.479 --> 00:04:36.409
 the default color is 5500 that 

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:38.449
 someone who is normal for a flash but 

00:04:36.409 --> 00:04:40.759
 we can customize that we can change it 

00:04:38.449 --> 00:04:44.000
 if we want once we have done this 

00:04:40.759 --> 00:04:45.949
 we turn to the often class and we are 

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:48.400
 ready to work new more 

00:04:45.949 --> 00:04:48.400
 power 

00:04:49.980 --> 00:04:54.910
 our function 

00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:56.410
 but the problem is not so much that it is not 

00:04:54.910 --> 00:04:58.360
 it's a fantastic piece that does not work 

00:04:56.410 --> 00:05:01.450
 a tremendous way like everything 

00:04:58.360 --> 00:05:03.820
 makes it possible really the problem is the 

00:05:01.450 --> 00:05:04.810
 lack of clarity at the time of telling you 

00:05:03.820 --> 00:05:08.290
 that the first thing to do is 

00:05:04.810 --> 00:05:10.950
 synchronize this this remote with the 

00:05:08.290 --> 00:05:10.950
 studio lights
