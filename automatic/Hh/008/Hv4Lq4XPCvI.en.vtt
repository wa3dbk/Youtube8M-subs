00:00:03.830 --> 00:00:10.349
 hello my love i want today 

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:12.599
 imagine this palette and that is 

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:14.849
 the w7 that's a pretty cheap one 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:18.529
 the very many tube smart brands 

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:21.539
 and that is called this palette costs 

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:23.699
 and there are four eyeshadows in there 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:26.009
 They kinda stick to me too 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:28.589
 a corner palette I wish to remember 

00:00:26.009 --> 00:00:31.230
 you the times so those are the colors 

00:00:28.589 --> 00:00:35.370
 It's like the hands are now recognizable 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:37.620
 just not so good but i find that 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:40.860
 the palette is well pigmented 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:43.910
 and that we have a price around four euro 50 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:46.380
 I think it's totally okay so really great 

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:48.120
 you get on amazon the link to it 

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:51.330
 you can find everything in the infobox 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:53.490
 and i can recommend you i have 

00:00:51.330 --> 00:00:56.160
 also made this way from luther with make-up 

00:00:53.490 --> 00:00:57.330
 and if you still have your turn then 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:00.720
 can you also watch me like that 

00:00:57.330 --> 00:01:03.690
 make-up and the airplay gravel 

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:06.299
 fine and if interested in what 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:10.409
 on the lips I've used there 

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:13.770
 a lipliner it too from 27 

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:15.060
 but he has no color indication 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:18.689
 I think that's a bit silly now 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:20.369
 but there are not that many 

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:21.600
 I still have a red home to the 

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:24.539
 are in any case very nice the 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:28.799
 hold up well and dare on the eyes 

00:01:24.539 --> 00:01:30.719
 I also have a b73 pencil and that 

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:32.369
 is the master brewer and then there is 

00:01:30.719 --> 00:01:34.859
 also no specific color 

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:35.939
 that's just such a dark brown me 

00:01:34.859 --> 00:01:36.659
 I thought I'd set that up for you 

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:38.850
 a little bit ahead 

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:41.009
 but I can really recommend you 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:42.090
 the palette free such colors 

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:44.549
 decorated and I think of everything 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:46.619
 This copper tone is great because of the 

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:50.150
 Otherwise one finds in the theory in whole 

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:52.730
 many palettes namely not and after 

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:55.730
 she is definitely good for the price 

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:57.790
 I'll wear my shadow base first 

00:01:55.730 --> 00:02:01.280
 on and that is ported to the mac 

00:01:57.790 --> 00:02:07.280
 color first ali and namely that way 

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:11.420
 a shallow commutes then I take 

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:14.270
 airy brush and user half 

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:16.430
 color from the eyeshadow palette and 

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:20.780
 carry that on my whole mobile 

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:24.850
 lid on then uses this color 

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:24.850
 and carry it in the fold 

00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:55.150
 then the applicator of the betfair 

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:59.670

00:02:55.150 --> 00:03:03.130

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:05.050
 movable lid on the outer edge of the room and 

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:07.120
 in the middle now even if I have that 

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:13.840
 whole first nice with a blender 

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:17.410
 find the darkest color 

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:20.710
 and made into the outer lid fold and 

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:22.930
 I connect that down here with the 

00:03:20.710 --> 00:03:32.350
 eyes outward angles there is a beautiful 

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:35.040
 Woman and then everything is beautiful again 

00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:35.040

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:57.350

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:58.790
