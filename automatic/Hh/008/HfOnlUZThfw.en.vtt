00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.330
 here are some examples of 

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:05.819
 Thu 

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:06.750
 arranged on each side of the keyboards 

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:08.820
 make you hear 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:12.480
 the 1 of the new games that have been added 

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:15.210
 in 1998 in particular the games of the facade 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:17.369
 which are very heavy hoses very 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:20.210
 high and so they produce sounds 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:20.210
 very serious 

00:00:35.740 --> 00:00:39.980
 in staging and architecture 

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:42.470
 sound we will add pipes that 

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:44.870
 are on both sides of the biggest 

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:47.530
 pipe of the facade that are smaller 

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:47.530
 therefore more acute 

00:00:55.480 --> 00:01:02.170
 we will now add games that 

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:05.820
 are inside the big buffet 

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:05.820
 organ on the first floor 

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:32.310
 and so on more game more than 

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:32.310
 sounds more treble 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:57.580
 games now very strong that are 

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:59.980
 still inside languages 

00:01:57.580 --> 00:02:00.940
 they are located a little deep down because 

00:01:59.980 --> 00:02:03.940
 as they are very present 

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:05.140
 we do not usually confused 

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:07.270
 of honor that we do not put the games 

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:10.750
 stronger before we put them behind 

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:12.610
 so that the whole equilibrates very 

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:15.420
 very well the trumpets but bugle and 

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:15.420
 the bombards 

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:33.600
 obviously we realize 

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:36.720
 the evidence of the power of these games 

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:39.180
 now there is a second keyboard that 

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:42.390
 is located on the second floor quite 

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:46.560
 in water near the vault of the departure of the 

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:49.080
 vault of the dome near the pendant of 

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:51.360
 the cupola book there they are a lot 

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:54.740
 more distant and these are games that we 

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:54.740
 call recitative games 

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:09.140
 another 

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:15.920
 and so on 

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:40.430
 now he already has barley 

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:40.430
 very strong wood 

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:47.690
 a trumpet 

00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:57.060
 and an English horn 

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:04.530
 the three together 

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:17.789
 we call the stratagem in the organ 

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:19.620
 can play his games the second 

00:04:17.789 --> 00:04:22.680
 keyboard on those of the first keyboard 

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:24.150
 just by pressing a spoon in 

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:25.880
 metal that is here 

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:27.990
 the mechanics clings 

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:29.849
 automatically behind there is nothing 

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:32.160
 of electric except the engine which is a 

00:04:29.849 --> 00:04:34.710
 blower that pulses up to 

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:36.840
 inside and all the rest it's 

00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:39.419
 mechanical as in the 19th century it did not 

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:41.610
 not changed at all everything indicates annick 

00:04:39.419 --> 00:04:45.289
 date of the time it was restored 

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:45.289
 but it has not been modified 

00:04:53.350 --> 00:04:58.009
 it remains the games of the pedal when here 

00:04:56.120 --> 00:05:01.449
 there is pedal then we play of course 

00:04:58.009 --> 00:05:10.849
 with the feet we have wooden games 

00:05:01.449 --> 00:05:13.389
 very serious ones to which I will add 

00:05:10.849 --> 00:05:13.389
 more acute games 

00:05:18.050 --> 00:05:22.750
 all 

00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:22.750
 still more serious 

00:05:30.420 --> 00:05:37.340
 and I add games to the hands 

00:05:34.110 --> 00:05:37.340
 while playing with the feet 

00:05:39.070 --> 00:05:43.140
 making it a very instrument 

00:05:40.780 --> 00:05:43.140
 full 

00:05:53.600 --> 00:05:58.380
 there is obviously a game called the 

00:05:56.130 --> 00:06:00.180
 bomb the pedal is definitely 

00:05:58.380 --> 00:06:02.490
 the strongest game of this organ 

00:06:00.180 --> 00:06:05.580
 the crimes are very big and very high 

00:06:02.490 --> 00:06:07.770
 we put them a little below for 

00:06:05.580 --> 00:06:11.250
 that they can so that they have the 

00:06:07.770 --> 00:06:12.660
 enough to climb without being 

00:06:11.250 --> 00:06:14.280
 embarrassed he's right 

00:06:12.660 --> 00:06:16.169
 we did not bend them and to win 

00:06:14.280 --> 00:06:17.940
 instead we preferred to have them a 

00:06:16.169 --> 00:06:18.900
 a little lower so he can ride in 

00:06:17.940 --> 00:06:21.979
 all freedom 

00:06:18.900 --> 00:06:21.979
 and that's what it gives 

00:06:28.050 --> 00:06:32.819
 obviously I can add all these 

00:06:30.060 --> 00:06:34.560
 games together play the games of the 

00:06:32.819 --> 00:06:37.110
 first keyboard on the bottom bracket thanks to 

00:06:34.560 --> 00:06:39.659
 this pedal and the games of the second 

00:06:37.110 --> 00:06:43.259
 keyboard on the bottom bracket also the 

00:06:39.659 --> 00:06:46.520
 keyboards together and so on and we're going 

00:06:43.259 --> 00:06:46.520
 have the strongest games 

00:07:08.580 --> 00:07:14.530
 here is an acquaintance a first 

00:07:11.710 --> 00:07:17.580
 knowledge with their remarks the de 

00:07:14.530 --> 00:07:17.580
