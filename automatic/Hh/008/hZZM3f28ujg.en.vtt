they'll<00:01:45.540> be<00:01:45.570> worth<00:01:45.840> money<00:01:46.140> but<00:01:46.740> the<00:01:46.920> way<00:01:47.009> I

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.040 
they'll be worth money but the way I

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:49.639 
they'll be worth money but the way I
look<00:01:47.369> at<00:01:47.490> it<00:01:47.520> is<00:01:47.729> you<00:01:47.970> know<00:01:48.060> the<00:01:48.240> player<00:01:48.649> that

00:01:49.639 --> 00:01:49.649 
look at it is you know the player that

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:50.840 
look at it is you know the player that
is<00:01:49.680> buying<00:01:50.159> this<00:01:50.310> is<00:01:50.490> going<00:01:50.670> to<00:01:50.729> be<00:01:50.820> a

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:50.850 
is buying this is going to be a

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:52.940 
is buying this is going to be a
disadvantage<00:01:51.240> where<00:01:51.689> the<00:01:51.840> player<00:01:52.020> that<00:01:52.350> is<00:01:52.409> or

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950 
disadvantage where the player that is or

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:54.590 
disadvantage where the player that is or
the<00:01:53.159> vendor<00:01:53.759> that<00:01:53.909> is<00:01:54.060> selling<00:01:54.329> these<00:01:54.450> is

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:54.600 
the vendor that is selling these is

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:57.109 
the vendor that is selling these is
basically<00:01:55.320> a<00:01:55.350> better<00:01:56.040> advantage<00:01:56.610> because

00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:57.119 
basically a better advantage because

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:01.249 
basically a better advantage because
they<00:01:57.659> understand<00:01:58.259> that<00:01:58.380> they<00:02:00.020> can<00:02:01.020> put

00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:01.259 
they understand that they can put

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:02.600 
they understand that they can put
thousands<00:02:01.740> and<00:02:01.890> thousands<00:02:02.310> of<00:02:02.340> these<00:02:02.490> little

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:02.610 
thousands and thousands of these little

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:04.370 
thousands and thousands of these little
like<00:02:02.790> booster<00:02:03.149> packs<00:02:03.360> together<00:02:03.689> and<00:02:03.930> charge

for<00:02:39.510> sure<00:02:39.690> going<00:02:39.930> to<00:02:40.050> be<00:02:40.140> a<00:02:40.170> big<00:02:40.380> I<00:02:40.530> then<00:02:40.860> yeah

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:41.010 
for sure going to be a big I then yeah

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:42.530 
for sure going to be a big I then yeah
your<00:02:41.190> chances<00:02:41.460> are<00:02:41.550> probably<00:02:41.640> better<00:02:41.880> buying

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:42.540 
your chances are probably better buying

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:44.120 
your chances are probably better buying
a<00:02:42.690> little<00:02:42.900> odd<00:02:43.080> the<00:02:43.530> pack<00:02:43.710> for<00:02:43.740> ten<00:02:44.010> bucks

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:44.130 
a little odd the pack for ten bucks

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:45.770 
a little odd the pack for ten bucks
rather<00:02:44.430> than<00:02:44.550> buying<00:02:44.760> a<00:02:44.970> booster<00:02:45.360> pack<00:02:45.540> and

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:45.780 
rather than buying a booster pack and

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:48.290 
rather than buying a booster pack and
trying<00:02:46.260> to<00:02:46.470> pull<00:02:46.680> one<00:02:46.710> because<00:02:47.100> obviously<00:02:47.340> the

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:48.300 
trying to pull one because obviously the

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:49.790 
trying to pull one because obviously the
chances<00:02:48.690> of<00:02:48.720> you<00:02:48.870> getting<00:02:48.990> a<00:02:49.230> seeker<00:02:49.590> is

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:49.800 
chances of you getting a seeker is

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:52.310 
chances of you getting a seeker is
basically<00:02:50.310> about<00:02:50.430> 1<00:02:50.850> in<00:02:51.090> 30<00:02:51.570> that's<00:02:51.900> about<00:02:52.110> the

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:52.320 
basically about 1 in 30 that's about the

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:54.890 
basically about 1 in 30 that's about the
ratio<00:02:52.860> and<00:02:53.070> on<00:02:53.430> top<00:02:53.580> of<00:02:53.640> that<00:02:53.790> it<00:02:54.210> could<00:02:54.540> be<00:02:54.570> any

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:54.900 
ratio and on top of that it could be any

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:56.660 
ratio and on top of that it could be any
secret<00:02:55.500> rare<00:02:55.650> so<00:02:55.920> your<00:02:56.100> chances<00:02:56.430> are<00:02:56.490> pretty

00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:56.670 
secret rare so your chances are pretty

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:58.460 
secret rare so your chances are pretty
slim<00:02:56.790> in<00:02:57.030> that<00:02:57.210> but<00:02:57.450> I<00:02:57.570> would<00:02:57.720> still<00:02:57.900> say<00:02:57.960> that

00:02:58.460 --> 00:02:58.470 
slim in that but I would still say that

00:02:58.470 --> 00:02:59.720 
slim in that but I would still say that
it's<00:02:58.590> going<00:02:58.710> to<00:02:58.800> be<00:02:58.860> much<00:02:58.980> better<00:02:59.160> in<00:02:59.460> this

00:02:59.720 --> 00:02:59.730 
it's going to be much better in this

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:02.780 
it's going to be much better in this
where<00:02:59.970> this<00:03:00.410> obviously<00:03:01.410> is<00:03:01.740> a<00:03:02.040> wayward<00:03:02.370> you

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:02.790 
where this obviously is a wayward you

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:03.710 
where this obviously is a wayward you
don't<00:03:02.940> even<00:03:03.030> know<00:03:03.210> that<00:03:03.240> there's<00:03:03.510> going<00:03:03.630> to<00:03:03.690> be

00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:03.720 
don't even know that there's going to be

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:05.150 
don't even know that there's going to be
a<00:03:03.810> big<00:03:03.990> I<00:03:04.080> I'm<00:03:04.230> not<00:03:04.350> saying<00:03:04.560> that<00:03:04.680> there<00:03:04.860> isn't

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:05.160 
a big I I'm not saying that there isn't

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:06.890 
a big I I'm not saying that there isn't
in<00:03:05.250> here<00:03:05.430> but<00:03:05.670> like<00:03:05.790> I<00:03:05.910> said<00:03:05.970> your<00:03:06.450> chances<00:03:06.810> are

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:06.900 
in here but like I said your chances are

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:09.710 
in here but like I said your chances are
much<00:03:07.550> better<00:03:08.550> off<00:03:08.700> proponent<00:03:09.390> booster<00:03:09.630> by

00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:09.720 
much better off proponent booster by

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:10.790 
much better off proponent booster by
even<00:03:10.020> though<00:03:10.080> those<00:03:10.260> chances<00:03:10.590> are<00:03:10.710> pretty

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:10.800 
even though those chances are pretty

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:12.500 
even though those chances are pretty
slim<00:03:10.920> but<00:03:11.550> I<00:03:11.580> hope<00:03:11.760> this<00:03:11.940> helps<00:03:12.150> you<00:03:12.180> guys<00:03:12.240> out

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:21.990 
and I think that singles are an

00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:23.870 
and I think that singles are an
excellent<00:03:22.320> way<00:03:22.560> to<00:03:22.710> do<00:03:23.160> so<00:03:23.340> but<00:03:23.550> always

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:23.880 
excellent way to do so but always

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:26.000 
excellent way to do so but always
