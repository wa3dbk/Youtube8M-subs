00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:49.450 
for me but we'll see that might be the

00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:51.050 
for me but we'll see that might be the
only<00:03:49.480> way<00:03:49.690> that<00:03:49.720> I<00:03:49.900> really<00:03:50.110> end<00:03:50.500> up<00:03:50.680> like

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:51.060 
only way that I really end up like

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:53.759 
only way that I really end up like
liking<00:03:52.060> this<00:03:52.420> but<00:03:52.870> again<00:03:53.110> I'm<00:03:53.320> probably<00:03:53.560> gonna

00:03:53.759 --> 00:03:53.769 
liking this but again I'm probably gonna

00:03:53.769 --> 00:03:55.650 
liking this but again I'm probably gonna
use<00:03:53.980> a<00:03:54.010> brush<00:03:54.280> with<00:03:54.550> that<00:03:54.580> but<00:03:54.940> then<00:03:55.120> no<00:03:55.390> I'm

00:03:55.650 --> 00:03:55.660 
use a brush with that but then no I'm

00:03:55.660 --> 00:03:57.060 
use a brush with that but then no I'm
gonna<00:03:55.810> put<00:03:55.959> a<00:03:55.989> couple<00:03:56.050> drops<00:03:56.260> in<00:03:56.620> then<00:03:56.830> I<00:03:56.860> might

00:03:57.060 --> 00:03:57.070 
gonna put a couple drops in then I might

00:03:57.070 --> 00:03:58.500 
gonna put a couple drops in then I might
use<00:03:57.190> my<00:03:57.400> hands<00:03:57.640> with<00:03:57.820> it<00:03:57.940> to<00:03:58.060> apply<00:03:58.239> it<00:03:58.330> to<00:03:58.450> my

00:03:58.500 --> 00:03:58.510 
use my hands with it to apply it to my

00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:03.180 
use my hands with it to apply it to my
face<00:03:58.840> but<00:03:59.739> still<00:04:01.440> basically<00:04:02.440> this<00:04:02.739> is<00:04:02.890> just<00:04:03.100> an

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:03.190 
face but still basically this is just an

00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:05.460 
face but still basically this is just an
add-in<00:04:03.400> to<00:04:03.910> me<00:04:04.060> because<00:04:04.420> I<00:04:04.570> don't<00:04:04.780> like<00:04:05.080> it<00:04:05.320> as

00:04:05.460 --> 00:04:05.470 
add-in to me because I don't like it as

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:10.020 
add-in to me because I don't like it as
a<00:04:06.400> bronzer<00:04:07.180> I<00:04:08.070> don't<00:04:09.070> know<00:04:09.130> I<00:04:09.370> just<00:04:09.400> think<00:04:09.820> that

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:28.030 
prefer the Chanel bronzer Universal

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:30.780 
prefer the Chanel bronzer Universal
hands-down<00:04:28.540> over<00:04:29.050> that<00:04:29.220> the<00:04:30.220> Chanel<00:04:30.490> bronzer

00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:32.710 
Universal is much more expensive I think

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:36.450 
Universal is much more expensive I think
it's<00:04:32.830> around<00:04:32.920> $50<00:04:33.640> but<00:04:34.270> it<00:04:34.600> is<00:04:34.840> also<00:04:35.370> does<00:04:36.370> it

00:04:36.450 --> 00:04:36.460 
it's around $50 but it is also does it

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:38.100 
it's around $50 but it is also does it
say<00:04:36.550> how<00:04:36.640> many<00:04:36.790> ounces<00:04:37.090> it's<00:04:37.570> a<00:04:37.630> full<00:04:37.840> ounce

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:38.110 
say how many ounces it's a full ounce

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:40.050 
say how many ounces it's a full ounce
and<00:04:38.440> it<00:04:38.860> takes<00:04:39.070> forever<00:04:39.250> to<00:04:39.520> get<00:04:39.670> through<00:04:39.910> one

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:40.060 
and it takes forever to get through one

00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:41.670 
and it takes forever to get through one
of<00:04:40.090> those<00:04:40.240> things<00:04:40.540> like<00:04:40.810> I<00:04:41.050> think<00:04:41.110> I've<00:04:41.500> had

00:04:41.670 --> 00:04:41.680 
of those things like I think I've had

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:45.150 
of those things like I think I've had
this<00:04:41.830> one<00:04:41.980> for<00:04:42.040> a<00:04:42.190> long<00:04:42.400> while<00:04:42.700> like<00:04:43.830> and<00:04:44.830> I<00:04:44.980> hit

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:45.160 
this one for a long while like and I hit

00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:46.770 
this one for a long while like and I hit
pan<00:04:45.400> and<00:04:45.730> I'm<00:04:45.790> down<00:04:45.910> to<00:04:46.060> the<00:04:46.120> bottom<00:04:46.390> but<00:04:46.570> like

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:46.780 
pan and I'm down to the bottom but like

00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:49.770 
pan and I'm down to the bottom but like
it<00:04:47.500> takes<00:04:47.770> a<00:04:47.890> while<00:04:48.190> to<00:04:48.220> get<00:04:48.640> through<00:04:48.850> that<00:04:49.060> so

00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:49.780 
it takes a while to get through that so

00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:52.530 
it takes a while to get through that so
I<00:04:50.430> don't<00:04:51.430> know<00:04:51.610> I<00:04:51.790> just<00:04:51.970> wanted<00:04:52.180> to<00:04:52.300> tell<00:04:52.450> you

00:05:11.730 --> 00:05:11.740 
rephrase that so let's see here until my

00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:13.890 
rephrase that so let's see here until my
breakdown<00:05:12.270> pigmentation<00:05:13.270> I<00:05:13.360> think<00:05:13.540> it's<00:05:13.630> very

00:05:13.890 --> 00:05:13.900 
breakdown pigmentation I think it's very

00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:15.810 
breakdown pigmentation I think it's very
pigmented<00:05:14.290> the<00:05:14.590> color<00:05:14.830> is<00:05:15.010> very<00:05:15.370> similar<00:05:15.670> to

00:05:15.810 --> 00:05:15.820 
pigmented the color is very similar to

00:05:15.820 --> 00:05:18.330 
pigmented the color is very similar to
the<00:05:16.030> bronze<00:05:16.300> universal<00:05:17.020> it<00:05:17.440> is<00:05:17.710> matte<00:05:17.980> there

00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:18.340 
the bronze universal it is matte there

00:05:18.340 --> 00:05:23.010 
the bronze universal it is matte there
is<00:05:18.460> no<00:05:18.640> shimmer<00:05:19.230> and<00:05:20.230> it<00:05:20.620> is<00:05:20.800> a<00:05:20.830> pretty<00:05:21.220> color

00:05:23.010 --> 00:05:23.020 
is no shimmer and it is a pretty color

00:05:23.020 --> 00:05:24.750 
is no shimmer and it is a pretty color
so<00:05:23.440> pigmentation<00:05:24.010> is<00:05:24.100> great<00:05:24.310> five<00:05:24.550> out<00:05:24.730> of

00:05:24.750 --> 00:05:24.760 
so pigmentation is great five out of

00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:26.910 
so pigmentation is great five out of
five<00:05:24.940> the<00:05:25.210> texture<00:05:26.050> is<00:05:26.140> very<00:05:26.200> nice<00:05:26.620> it<00:05:26.800> is

00:05:26.910 --> 00:05:26.920 
five the texture is very nice it is

00:05:26.920 --> 00:05:31.560 
five the texture is very nice it is
smooth<00:05:27.340> it<00:05:27.760> is<00:05:27.820> very<00:05:29.340> just<00:05:30.340> silky<00:05:30.760> feeling<00:05:31.030> but

00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:31.570 
smooth it is very just silky feeling but

00:05:31.570 --> 00:05:33.510 
smooth it is very just silky feeling but
the<00:05:31.930> problem<00:05:32.290> is<00:05:32.440> is<00:05:32.650> it<00:05:32.770> also<00:05:32.890> dries<00:05:33.340> very

00:05:33.510 --> 00:05:33.520 
the problem is is it also dries very

00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:35.880 
the problem is is it also dries very
quickly<00:05:33.730> so<00:05:34.690> the<00:05:34.930> texture<00:05:35.230> is<00:05:35.410> somewhat<00:05:35.680> hard

00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:35.890 
quickly so the texture is somewhat hard

00:05:35.890 --> 00:05:37.080 
quickly so the texture is somewhat hard
to<00:05:35.950> work<00:05:36.160> with<00:05:36.310> so<00:05:36.490> I'm<00:05:36.580> gonna<00:05:36.670> say<00:05:36.880> it's<00:05:37.030> like

00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:37.090 
to work with so I'm gonna say it's like

00:05:37.090 --> 00:05:39.720 
to work with so I'm gonna say it's like
a<00:05:37.180> three<00:05:37.510> and<00:05:37.570> a<00:05:37.660> half<00:05:37.840> out<00:05:37.990> of<00:05:38.080> five<00:05:38.730> longevity

00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:39.730 
a three and a half out of five longevity

00:05:39.730 --> 00:05:41.820 
a three and a half out of five longevity
it<00:05:39.940> did<00:05:40.150> stay<00:05:40.690> on<00:05:40.840> and<00:05:41.080> does<00:05:41.260> stay<00:05:41.440> on<00:05:41.470> all<00:05:41.800> day

00:05:41.820 --> 00:05:41.830 
it did stay on and does stay on all day

00:05:41.830 --> 00:05:43.950 
it did stay on and does stay on all day
when<00:05:42.340> you<00:05:42.460> wear<00:05:42.640> it<00:05:42.790> that's<00:05:43.030> no<00:05:43.390> problem<00:05:43.630> at

00:05:43.950 --> 00:05:43.960 
when you wear it that's no problem at

00:05:43.960 --> 00:05:47.070 
when you wear it that's no problem at
all<00:05:44.020> that<00:05:44.890> part<00:05:45.160> is<00:05:45.310> great<00:05:45.700> so<00:05:46.300> longevity<00:05:46.840> is<00:05:46.900> 5

00:05:47.070 --> 00:05:47.080 
all that part is great so longevity is 5

00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:49.830 
all that part is great so longevity is 5
out<00:05:47.260> of<00:05:47.290> 5<00:05:47.500> application<00:05:48.460> it's<00:05:48.880> a<00:05:49.000> 1<00:05:49.390> out<00:05:49.570> of<00:05:49.600> 5

00:05:49.830 --> 00:05:49.840 
out of 5 application it's a 1 out of 5

00:05:49.840 --> 00:05:52.620 
out of 5 application it's a 1 out of 5
it's<00:05:50.200> bad<00:05:50.650> it's<00:05:51.520> not<00:05:51.760> easy<00:05:51.970> with<00:05:52.120> the<00:05:52.240> fingers

00:05:52.620 --> 00:05:52.630 
it's bad it's not easy with the fingers

00:05:52.630 --> 00:05:54.000 
it's bad it's not easy with the fingers
you<00:05:52.840> can<00:05:52.990> get<00:05:53.170> it<00:05:53.260> with<00:05:53.380> the<00:05:53.470> brushes<00:05:53.800> but<00:05:53.920> it

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:54.010 
you can get it with the brushes but it

00:05:54.010 --> 00:05:56.160 
you can get it with the brushes but it
uses<00:05:54.130> a<00:05:54.280> ton<00:05:54.520> of<00:05:54.550> product<00:05:54.850> I'm<00:05:55.150> not<00:05:55.660> a<00:05:55.690> fan<00:05:56.140> of

I think $35 for a third of it you know
0.3<00:06:09.550> ounces<00:06:10.320> is<00:06:11.320> a<00:06:11.350> lot<00:06:12.690> because<00:06:13.690> you<00:06:13.840> because

of how it works how you have to apply it

00:06:16.120 --> 00:06:17.760 
of how it works how you have to apply it
I<00:06:16.360> feel<00:06:16.690> like<00:06:16.780> I'm<00:06:16.900> going<00:06:17.020> to<00:06:17.080> use<00:06:17.140> a<00:06:17.260> lot<00:06:17.530> of<00:06:17.560> it

00:06:17.760 --> 00:06:17.770

00:06:17.770 --> 00:06:20.070 
I feel like I'm going to use a lot of it
quickly<00:06:18.010> so<00:06:18.370> prices<00:06:18.910> it's<00:06:19.390> a<00:06:19.510> 3<00:06:19.720> out<00:06:19.810> of<00:06:19.840> 5

00:06:20.070 --> 00:06:20.080 
quickly so prices it's a 3 out of 5

00:06:20.080 --> 00:06:23.220 
quickly so prices it's a 3 out of 5
product<00:06:20.980> overall<00:06:21.310> nez<00:06:21.700> I<00:06:21.880> think<00:06:22.300> I<00:06:22.540> love<00:06:23.050> the

00:06:23.220 --> 00:06:23.230 
product overall nez I think I love the

00:06:23.230 --> 00:06:24.660 
product overall nez I think I love the
coloring<00:06:23.560> but<00:06:23.890> I<00:06:24.100> don't<00:06:24.340> like<00:06:24.550> the

00:06:24.660 --> 00:06:24.670 
coloring but I don't like the

00:06:24.670 --> 00:06:26.520 
coloring but I don't like the
application<00:06:25.210> so<00:06:25.480> to<00:06:25.540> me<00:06:25.780> if<00:06:25.870> I<00:06:25.990> can't<00:06:26.230> apply

00:06:26.520 --> 00:06:26.530 
application so to me if I can't apply

00:06:26.530 --> 00:06:28.950 
application so to me if I can't apply
the<00:06:27.130> color<00:06:27.370> correctly<00:06:27.850> it's<00:06:28.090> not<00:06:28.300> worth<00:06:28.510> it<00:06:28.720> to

00:06:28.950 --> 00:06:28.960 
the color correctly it's not worth it to

00:06:28.960 --> 00:06:30.990 
the color correctly it's not worth it to
me<00:06:28.990> so<00:06:29.620> I<00:06:29.650> think<00:06:29.980> product<00:06:30.400> overall<00:06:30.700> and<00:06:30.880> this

00:06:30.990 --> 00:06:31.000 
me so I think product overall and this

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:32.910 
me so I think product overall and this
for<00:06:31.150> me<00:06:31.240> is<00:06:31.390> probably<00:06:31.540> only<00:06:31.810> a<00:06:31.960> 2<00:06:32.260> out<00:06:32.740> of<00:06:32.770> 5

00:06:32.910 --> 00:06:32.920 
for me is probably only a 2 out of 5

00:06:32.920 --> 00:06:34.740 
for me is probably only a 2 out of 5
it's<00:06:33.700> just<00:06:34.060> not<00:06:34.180> something<00:06:34.390> I<00:06:34.600> would

00:06:34.740 --> 00:06:34.750 
it's just not something I would

00:06:34.750 --> 00:06:36.540 
it's just not something I would
repurchase<00:06:35.080> I'm<00:06:35.590> gonna<00:06:35.830> work<00:06:36.100> with<00:06:36.280> it<00:06:36.430> I'm

00:06:36.540 --> 00:06:36.550 
repurchase I'm gonna work with it I'm

00:06:36.550 --> 00:06:38.130
