00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.959
 now the sesi is our pilot will pass 

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:10.940
 some little secrets for you to make a 

00:00:03.959 --> 00:00:10.940
 perfect goal and no chance 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:18.090
 My goodness, this is Priscilla the tourist. 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:20.279
 with 10 years of habilitation and ability 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:22.980
 from zero to park when I go 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:26.099
 put it vague I try and then start to 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:32.300
 Your start to get nervous I give up. 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:32.300
 I do not want to suffer again afar 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:38.820
 and look at the priscilla car and sensor 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:40.740
 aft and side ppp coming 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:42.600
 I look who arrives is being 

00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:44.690
 thus failing the band in my 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:44.690
 will 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:54.699
 never came was he left 

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:56.559
 parked in the bag so easy you 

00:00:54.699 --> 00:00:58.960
 first you have to understand a principle 

00:00:56.559 --> 00:01:01.719
 I'll show you something that comes to you. 

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:04.720
 you know what position car should be in 

00:01:01.719 --> 00:01:05.920
 parallel with these and puts it well 

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:09.399
 side of the other 

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:11.920
 gently forward the rear axle is 

00:01:09.399 --> 00:01:12.880
 a fixed point on the shaft that slides the shaft 

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:14.380
 front right 

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:18.549
 so it is easier to park aft 

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:19.990
 exactly because you already point the point 

00:01:18.549 --> 00:01:22.330
 fixed to where you want it to go 

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:24.549
 when you have the headlight 

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:27.100
 parallel here with the 

00:01:24.549 --> 00:01:30.270
 car front bumper who you 

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:34.000
 have to be with your rearview 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:36.340
 seeing this car headlight from behind 

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:38.049
 This is the time for you to turn around. 

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:39.909
 steering wheel in the opposite direction 

00:01:38.049 --> 00:01:42.819
 at the time you make it to the front 

00:01:39.909 --> 00:01:44.490
 slide and you will fit the car into the 

00:01:42.819 --> 00:01:47.590
 vacancy 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:50.200
 come on the provision to the rear or 

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:52.420
 a little ahead of everyone 

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:54.129
 concerned with mirror entitle which 

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:55.209
 It was what I showed you the rear view 

00:01:54.129 --> 00:01:58.300
 left is an awesome thing 

00:01:55.209 --> 00:02:01.060
 nobody looks to burn only found a beacon 

00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:03.759
 appear but it is already there 

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:06.489
 the bumpers stay in parallel to the 

00:02:03.759 --> 00:02:09.009
 stop here is perfect 

00:02:06.489 --> 00:02:14.920
 The headlight is coming in case of 

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:17.220
 betrayal since the woman is sure to 

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:17.220
 will fit 

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:25.940
 sesa is already there and when the vacancy 

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:28.790
 she will win a mall at all a 

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:33.170
 the other side due to the radius of 

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:36.140
 turning right is how much space the car 

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:38.390
 need to be able to maneuver harry 

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:40.760
 always need a smaller space 

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:42.800
 The time you see the half 

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:45.050
 of this car here and this one parallel 

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:47.860
 over here can express all the car 

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:47.860
 It will fit a good 

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:52.140
 the rear bumper 

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:54.290
 Red car 

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:57.180
 you have to get as close as possible 

00:02:54.290 --> 00:03:00.090
 this end on the side of my car with 

00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:03.390
 O that pleasure can unfold okay 

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:05.160
 can you stay behind to defeat 

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:10.470
 doing everything now everything everything everything everything 

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:13.370
 everything is going to hit me it seems I never did 

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:13.370
 this in my life 

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:21.990
 after this little hand of the session you need 

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:24.350
 do not lose another tire a trace of 

00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:24.350
 guide
