00:00:09.349 --> 00:00:13.110
 judging these formats 4 euros ht I hope 

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:14.219
 that you are many other young people 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:16.199
 is found for the review of olive 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:18.330
 giroud version a form so the scorer 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:20.580
 French arsenal that has been boosted 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:21.840
 after his double and decisive pass 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:23.220
 this weekend you see he's in the 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:25.410
 same barclays team first league 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:27.330
 the one I did with 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:28.500
 inform sturridge review you see some 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:30.779
 statins games that are in the process of 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:31.859
 scroll in front of you now so I 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:33.360
 invite you to pause or to 

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:35.940
 put back for good the 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:37.590
 observe so olivier giroud I'm going 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:39.930
 start by talking about the negatives 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:40.860
 as usual so at the level of 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:43.110
 negative points 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:45.510
 speed speed is still 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:47.430
 quite problematic it's true that he 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:49.410
 is very slow so what is he in front 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:52.500
 the cages there is no problem it is 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:53.460
 very slow but we will say that if you 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:55.320
 get to serve him in the right 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:56.760
 position the speed will not ask too much 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:58.649
 of problems and this with times on 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:00.000
 certain phases where everything is brought to 

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:01.219
 go against the attack the giro has 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.470
 really hard to follow 

00:01:01.219 --> 00:01:05.820
 then we technically shoot down in 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:06.950
 dribbling so technically I was 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:08.580
 pretty disappointed 

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:10.020
 technically it's still weak 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:10.920
 it's still weak so already two 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:13.200
 star technical gesture 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:15.119
 a really average andrÃ© stat so that 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:17.100
 and who on that side the technical side 

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:17.880
 we must forget it's not with him 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:19.310
 that you are going to make passings of 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:22.110
 legs of the wheels in all directions 

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:23.549
 because simply he can not and 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:24.630
 the three bad-foot stars that 

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:26.430
 can be problematic 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:27.509
 he has three stars bad foot but his 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:29.430
 right foot for me to find them 

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:30.659
 really nonexistent that's really the 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:31.860
 pure left-handed ie the guy who 

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:33.600
 welcomes left foot ila that foot 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:35.790
 left and his right foot is totally 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:37.829
 useless then we go to the point 

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:39.240
 positive not so we have not bad so before 

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:41.220
 the cages he's really very very good 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:43.200
 95 in finish 

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:44.250
 the volley ups balas and the 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:46.470
 first you will see that there is a 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:48.420
 second so they like this little 

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:50.460
 kind side to tulle serves in the surface 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:52.200
 he strikes without question of 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:53.520
 the tomb straw does not control at 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:54.810
 level of ball checks that's 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:56.330
 very good the game head 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:57.830
 obviously it's a giroud 

00:01:56.330 --> 00:02:00.080
 of the head if he is really very very 

00:01:57.830 --> 00:02:01.610
 good by the way there are subscribers when 

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:02.690
 I posted the team on twitter and 

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:04.010
 facebook who told me to play the 

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:06.110
 two attackers you'll see he's very 

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:07.250
 very good bah frankly in a 4-3-3 

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:09.649
 only in peak I found they 

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:11.810
 were they were huge of agreement 

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:13.910
 pivot simply a dinguerie so 

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:15.110
 good quality of pass that the quality not 

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:16.520
 I want to clarify because he made me 

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:18.980
 really a lot of assists 

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:21.110
 it's really the ideal pivot its pivots 

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:22.640
 perfect not technical at all certainly 

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:23.180
 but at the level of the aggressiveness of the 

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:24.980
 physical 

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:26.300
 it hurts so the physics the 

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:27.710
 mii in the positives we hold 

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:30.080
 really good on his legs he 

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:32.750
 1.88 in shape that moves enormously low 

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:34.310
 he moves he moves very strongly the 

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:36.380
 defenders the defenders can not 

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:38.270
 follow him face the game so 

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:39.380
 I talked about it you have a little example 

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:40.610
 I did not score a lot of goals from the 

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:42.500
 head that and that I have not done too much 

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:44.900
 centers the set pieces 

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:46.100
 I did not put it but it shoots very well 

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:48.080
 the penalties it will go very well 

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:50.720
 penaltys I believe alas a little 81 more 

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:51.800
 of 86 years old penalties so you see in 

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:53.840
 the same match twice at the same place 

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:55.670
 twice in the skylight is good 

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:57.709
 shot and the guardian anyway plunges 

00:02:55.670 --> 00:03:00.020
 on the wrong side so it's a goal and then 

00:02:57.709 --> 00:03:01.730
 after that so finish even though as 

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:03.380
 I typed long power pot poles 

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:05.780
 hitting it will really make very very 

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:07.880
 strong then the pass quality is 

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:09.080
 really where I was surprised he does 

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:10.400
 really very nice passes very 

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:12.019
 nice deviation so yeah that's 

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:13.280
 really the perfect pivot that marks 

00:03:12.019 --> 00:03:15.709
 goals there you still have a monster 

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:16.880
 still have a low post I have not and 

00:03:15.709 --> 00:03:18.170
 I was out of luck I missed 

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:19.519
 chance in certain situations and so 

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:21.350
 this is the last clip with the girou 

00:03:19.519 --> 00:03:23.900
 so volley recovery directly 

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:25.310
 without asking any questions this is me 

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:28.070
 that I liked is the pivot side 

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:29.959
 the powerful side and he strikes in all 

00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:31.250
 the senses so bah frankly beautiful 

00:03:29.959 --> 00:03:33.050
 surprise good surprise I have a lot 

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:34.670
 liked the price I did not put in the 

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:36.920
 no more in the east - you can the 

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:39.590
 find at monza plus a little more 

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:40.760
 50000 crazy I think it goes to 60 me 

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:42.530
 credit something like that so that's 

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:44.060
 really low it's really affordable 

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:45.320
 I could have put it in the most 

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:47.239
 because of the quality of the 

00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:48.680
 player frankly it's heavy so 

00:03:47.239 --> 00:03:51.230
 in the positives I put the 

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:52.730
 jump I put this stats years to the shutter 

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:54.500
 finish in front of the cages it is 

00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:55.730
 really very very good the controls of 

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:57.080
 ball and control it really does it 

00:03:55.730 --> 00:03:58.670
 very good control in the race that 

00:03:57.080 --> 00:04:00.180
 put a big positive point 

00:03:58.670 --> 00:04:02.489
 then the physical 

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:03.989
 the ong shot repositioning head game 

00:04:02.489 --> 00:04:06.569
 he's really making really good calls he 

00:04:03.989 --> 00:04:08.519
 has average average contributions and 

00:04:06.569 --> 00:04:09.719
 what makes it is I find it 

00:04:08.519 --> 00:04:11.670
 is always well placed it is necessary 

00:04:09.719 --> 00:04:14.099
 place his pass quality which is 

00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:15.569
 really big more really a very very 

00:04:14.099 --> 00:04:18.150
 good player to play pivot 

00:04:15.569 --> 00:04:20.070
 punching power a very big 

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:22.800
 big shot and after so in the excitement 

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:24.270
 I put dribble speed two stars 

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:24.840
 three stars bad foot two stars 

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:27.180
 technical gesture 

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:29.100
 it's true that technically really 

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:30.539
 technical ease mamba and that's it 

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:32.729
 technically it's weak 

00:04:30.539 --> 00:04:34.380
 after speed it can be a problem 

00:04:32.729 --> 00:04:35.849
 in the east on the counter phases 

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:37.380
 attack but in the end if you get to 

00:04:35.849 --> 00:04:39.270
 serve well in the surface when as 

00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:40.530
 there must be no problem but 

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:42.120
 I did, however, that I held to the 

00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:44.009
 specify is so in the is more in 

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:45.539
 the teeth the balance sheet with the balance sheet so 10 

00:04:44.009 --> 00:04:47.220
 matches 10 goals 7 assists so 

00:04:45.539 --> 00:04:49.349
 a record really really very very good 

00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:52.139
 for one for a scorer serge am not 

00:04:49.349 --> 00:04:53.970
 crazy positive but here on the 10 

00:04:52.139 --> 00:04:55.620
 matches he is at the origin of 15 goals this 

00:04:53.970 --> 00:04:57.539
 who does that if in the end you are when 

00:04:55.620 --> 00:04:58.800
 even in the positive with him knowing 

00:04:57.539 --> 00:05:00.479
 that I typed a lot of times 

00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:01.590
 the posts you could see it and so 

00:05:00.479 --> 00:05:02.849
 I like he has a very good note jamie 

00:05:01.590 --> 00:05:04.020
 index is surely that's it's really 

00:05:02.849 --> 00:05:06.120
 a nice surprise of giroud I 

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:07.320
 really expected when I bought it 

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:09.090
 I was expecting nothing I was expecting 

00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:11.580
 nothing I did not do a priori neither 

00:05:09.090 --> 00:05:13.020
 nothing but I did not say yeah what 

00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:14.789
 day there I'm not going who does or this day 

00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:16.169
 there I go who v and in the end I loved 

00:05:14.789 --> 00:05:17.940
 so that's all for the review 

00:05:16.169 --> 00:05:19.560
 olive tree giroud a shape so this review 

00:05:17.940 --> 00:05:21.000
