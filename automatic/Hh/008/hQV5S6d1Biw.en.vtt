00:02:58.820 --> 00:03:02.380 
beginning because with the foot um
I<00:02:59.380> it<00:03:00.380> tore<00:03:00.800> once<00:03:01.100> and<00:03:01.400> then<00:03:01.519> it<00:03:01.850> happened

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:02.390 
I it tore once and then it happened

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:03.789 
I it tore once and then it happened
again<00:03:02.660> and<00:03:02.840> I<00:03:02.930> think<00:03:03.170> that<00:03:03.290> was<00:03:03.440> the<00:03:03.530> hardest

00:03:03.789 --> 00:03:03.799 
again and I think that was the hardest

00:03:03.799 --> 00:03:05.289 
again and I think that was the hardest
part<00:03:03.920> when<00:03:04.280> it<00:03:04.310> happened<00:03:04.700> again<00:03:04.910> I<00:03:04.970> thought

00:03:05.289 --> 00:03:05.299 
part when it happened again I thought

00:03:05.299 --> 00:03:05.770 
part when it happened again I thought
okay

00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:05.780 
okay

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:08.050 
okay
will<00:03:06.170> I<00:03:06.260> be<00:03:06.500> able<00:03:06.590> to<00:03:06.769> play<00:03:06.980> again<00:03:07.489> and<00:03:07.579> that

00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:08.060 
will I be able to play again and that

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:09.490 
will I be able to play again and that
was<00:03:08.150> a<00:03:08.180> tough<00:03:08.420> decision<00:03:08.540> do<00:03:09.110> I<00:03:09.170> get<00:03:09.380> the

00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:09.500 
was a tough decision do I get the

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:11.620 
was a tough decision do I get the
surgery<00:03:09.950> or<00:03:10.190> do<00:03:10.370> I<00:03:10.430> play<00:03:10.519> without<00:03:11.060> getting<00:03:11.480> it

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:11.630 
surgery or do I play without getting it

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:13.690 
surgery or do I play without getting it
and<00:03:11.780> suffer<00:03:12.019> for<00:03:12.170> the<00:03:12.260> rest<00:03:12.440> of<00:03:12.530> my<00:03:12.650> life<00:03:12.680> and<00:03:13.430> I

and suffer for the rest of my life and I

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:16.030 
and suffer for the rest of my life and I
decided<00:03:13.760> I<00:03:14.209> get<00:03:14.450> the<00:03:14.570> surgery<00:03:14.989> and<00:03:15.230> you<00:03:15.920> know

me because I put so much pressure on
myself<00:03:35.660> and<00:03:36.400> after<00:03:37.400> that<00:03:37.579> I<00:03:37.880> just<00:03:38.060> took<00:03:38.450> all

myself and after that I just took all

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:40.750 
myself and after that I just took all
the<00:03:38.750> pressure<00:03:38.900> off<00:03:39.079> and<00:03:39.530> I<00:03:39.829> just<00:03:40.250> decided<00:03:40.519> to

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:40.760 
the pressure off and I just decided to

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:42.970
