00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:12.059
 obviously many people say 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:14.599
 is a shy person is sad 

00:00:14.599 --> 00:00:17.599
 the hype 

00:00:20.769 --> 00:00:24.210
 many of the times we use as with masks 

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:27.109
 i and the chosen one 

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:29.640
 in this country 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:32.640
 and when you fall a deep depression 

00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:37.060
 also the inaction of a serious injury 

00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:41.340
 this one is when people take account 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:44.340
 because it can last up to ten years 

00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:48.580
 illanes 20 years and people have never realized 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:52.710
 This is how we are more in 15 attempts 

00:00:57.860 --> 00:01:00.860
 The psychiatrist said that Mexico matters 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:03.150
 and later 

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:06.150
 looks less hot 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:11.180
 it has been difficult 

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:15.350
 and this both personal relationships with smoke and with myself 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:19.370
 because precious account of many things that 

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:21.530
 that were wrong 

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:24.530
 the way I want to normalize life 

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:33.340
 in adolescence when they also act 

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:36.010
 my father 

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:39.600
 word that nobody already believes it 

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:45.930
 it's like pando 1 account from when it's very difficult 

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:53.860
 in my family life 

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:55.380
 alex a restaurant 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:58.380
 Yes because 

00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:02.950
 and bruce 

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:05.950
 until that song 

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:09.890
 in indie cinema communicate to distinguish what I had to do 

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:13.399
 although I could not go 

00:02:14.809 --> 00:02:17.809
 if it did not whistle complicated 

00:02:20.249 --> 00:02:23.719
 I have always thought that other people decide here 

00:02:23.719 --> 00:02:26.719
 He explained that if you do things 

00:02:27.289 --> 00:02:29.289
 there was no 

00:02:29.289 --> 00:02:32.289
 it does not let me 

00:02:36.029 --> 00:02:38.389
 anxiety 

00:02:38.389 --> 00:02:41.389
 the Dragons 

00:02:43.749 --> 00:02:46.749
 edition to nobody 

00:02:48.799 --> 00:02:51.799
 the cesses as 

00:02:59.819 --> 00:03:02.819
 I did not know what that instrument was 

00:03:11.669 --> 00:03:14.669
 that's why I tried but 

00:03:18.629 --> 00:03:22.309
 so far as he said in an act in the event room the last time was 

00:03:22.309 --> 00:03:25.659
 with pills 

00:03:25.659 --> 00:03:27.969
 Pepe regretted that it was not taken 

00:03:27.969 --> 00:03:31.969
 that's what we said I prefer that they have to hand even further 

00:03:34.079 --> 00:03:37.079
 that is, they 

00:03:42.099 --> 00:03:44.609
 always always do women 

00:03:44.609 --> 00:03:46.849
 so reserved to act 

00:03:46.849 --> 00:03:48.729
 to show my feelings 

00:03:48.729 --> 00:03:51.729
 without despising macarena with 

00:03:53.249 --> 00:03:56.119
 of that he also attributed ochoa 

00:03:56.119 --> 00:03:59.119
 shakira and pique was the strongest 

00:04:02.989 --> 00:04:06.119
 is very misinformed about this about this species 

00:04:06.779 --> 00:04:09.659
 about this disease 

00:04:09.659 --> 00:04:13.700
 then they have been given pills and it is a habit that will cause addiction 

00:04:14.309 --> 00:04:17.350
 in the desert between those satellites in life completely 

00:04:19.919 --> 00:04:21.379
 I am a psychologist 

00:04:21.379 --> 00:04:24.379
 the social head psychiatrist 

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:33.650
 and is that despite having orange with that line because the crisis 

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:39.610
 and the race would be like that to the malaguista in short and what they did was the 

00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:40.729
 committee 

00:04:40.729 --> 00:04:44.490
 already in that information and the common information of that country 

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:50.400
 the first times that came common 

00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:54.819
 with what came greater herd 

00:04:54.819 --> 00:04:57.819
 gerrans as the date 

00:04:58.779 --> 00:05:02.199
 then the jump to the nba but 

00:05:02.199 --> 00:05:05.199
 without making enough noise 

00:05:09.969 --> 00:05:11.809
 chiquis report 

00:05:11.809 --> 00:05:14.339
