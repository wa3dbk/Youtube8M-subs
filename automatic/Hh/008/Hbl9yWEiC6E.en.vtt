00:02:28.809 --> 00:02:28.819 
knows maybe the he might have a huge

00:02:28.819 --> 00:02:32.110 
knows maybe the he might have a huge
factor<00:02:29.269> in<00:02:29.480> how<00:02:29.989> to<00:02:30.530> beat<00:02:30.860> a<00:02:31.040> with<00:02:31.340> her<00:02:31.430> but<00:02:32.090> I
