00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:11.160
 hi internet this is games from australia 

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:13.139
 Now I was walking here on the female whether this area 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:14.130
 which is on the beach in the city 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:15.990
 Melbourne 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:18.390
 I have a video about this area and 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:21.060
 now here in this area there 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:22.769
 botanical gardens in which I have all been long 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:25.140
 I wanted to go as there was no time 

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:27.029
 now I passed by looking it open 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:30.140
 today is saturday so let's go 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:30.140
 let's see how much she loves 

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:14.220
 but 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:29.880
 but these things on the palm tree are made for 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:31.969
 so that opossums are not climbed by 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:31.969
 trees 

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:57.239
 too much water gurgles 

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:05.240
 here I came here a single person 

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:09.140
 no one is here 

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:11.540
 lest nobody is looking 

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:16.940
 something so you try to scratch 

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:21.470
 and in general there is nobody here, of course 

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:25.330
 it feels warmer than not 

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:29.180
 so stuffy as in the greenhouses in our gardens 

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:35.620
 but pretty warm apparently 

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:43.250
 but because plants still produce 

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:46.780
 its heat outside the curtains to close 

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:52.390
 when it's too sunny here in the summer and 

00:03:46.780 --> 00:04:05.290
 here look straight these watering hoses 

00:03:52.390 --> 00:04:05.290
 and here is this fountain that gurgles 

00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:48.610
 but 

00:05:13.569 --> 00:05:17.889
 such a video you in the botanical garden in 

00:05:16.059 --> 00:05:19.389
 females or as usual if she is you 

00:05:17.889 --> 00:05:20.860
 like we like and ask your 

00:05:19.389 --> 00:05:22.629
 questions in the comments under this video 

00:05:20.860 --> 00:05:23.879
 of course we subscribe to both 

00:05:22.629 --> 00:05:25.839
 Australia to keep abreast of updates 

00:05:23.879 --> 00:05:38.229
 thank you so much for watching 

00:05:25.839 --> 00:05:41.289
 dating internet without australia 

00:05:38.229 --> 00:05:45.580
 today's video 5 theme is so spontaneous 

00:05:41.289 --> 00:05:48.180
 It turned out a bit probably due to the fact 

00:05:45.580 --> 00:05:52.959
 that I have been a lot of time lately 

00:05:48.180 --> 00:05:56.319
 spent with friends who are worried 

00:05:52.959 --> 00:05:59.379
 the question is what to return home 

00:05:56.319 --> 00:06:02.649
 what is the question again immigration and 

00:05:59.379 --> 00:06:06.399
 brilliantly be surprised but here we are 

00:06:02.649 --> 00:06:08.949
 talk to people about what you are 

00:06:06.399 --> 00:06:11.949
 his nafig and about how to go back 

00:06:08.949 --> 00:06:14.979
 home quite often probably more often than 

00:06:11.949 --> 00:06:18.479
 we talk about migration when we 

00:06:14.979 --> 00:06:22.409
 we are at home and now the last time I 

00:06:18.479 --> 00:06:25.779
 talk to that father i met up with 

00:06:22.409 --> 00:06:28.629
 one girl who is here about seven years old 

00:06:25.779 --> 00:06:30.519
 which mom is about ten years old 

00:06:28.629 --> 00:06:34.059
 said that the imam was all going home 

00:06:30.519 --> 00:06:37.329
 back to go then met with a friend 

00:06:34.059 --> 00:06:44.229
 One of Moscow, he also thinks now 

00:06:37.329 --> 00:06:47.369
 back to go and here is one such idea in 

00:06:44.229 --> 00:06:50.699
 these conversations were proton when 

00:06:47.369 --> 00:06:50.699
 immigration well
