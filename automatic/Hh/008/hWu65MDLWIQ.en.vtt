this one that says fall I saw tons of

00:05:39.330 --> 00:05:41.209 
this one that says fall I saw tons of
fall<00:05:39.539> stuff<00:05:39.810> that<00:05:39.990> I<00:05:40.020> wanted<00:05:40.259> to<00:05:40.409> buy<00:05:40.529> but<00:05:40.800> I

00:05:41.209 --> 00:05:41.219 
fall stuff that I wanted to buy but I

00:05:41.219 --> 00:05:43.519 
fall stuff that I wanted to buy but I
held<00:05:41.580> myself<00:05:41.789> back<00:05:42.120> it<00:05:42.689> was<00:05:43.080> all<00:05:43.229> forty

00:05:44.899 --> 00:05:44.909 
percent off but I just thought oh I

through what I have downstairs and make

00:05:49.529 --> 00:05:50.990 
through what I have downstairs and make
sure<00:05:49.589> I'm<00:05:49.800> not<00:05:49.860> duplicating<00:05:50.520> things<00:05:50.699> first

00:05:50.990 --> 00:05:51.000

working on getting all of the seasons
for<00:05:57.060> that<00:05:57.210> so<00:05:58.050> this<00:05:58.229> was<00:05:58.469> my<00:05:58.710> hall<00:05:58.889> for<00:05:59.099> today<00:05:59.250> I

00:05:59.269 --> 00:05:59.279 
for that so this was my hall for today I

00:05:59.279 --> 00:06:00.800 
for that so this was my hall for today I
thought<00:05:59.460> I<00:05:59.520> did<00:05:59.729> pretty<00:05:59.759> good<00:06:00.060> for<00:06:00.210> sixty

00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:00.810 
thought I did pretty good for sixty

00:06:00.810 --> 00:06:02.480 
thought I did pretty good for sixty
dollars<00:06:01.199> worth<00:06:01.439> of<00:06:01.529> stuff<00:06:01.770> these<00:06:02.099> were<00:06:02.279> only<00:06:02.399> a

00:06:02.480 --> 00:06:02.490 
dollars worth of stuff these were only a

00:06:02.490 --> 00:06:04.369 
dollars worth of stuff these were only a
dollar<00:06:02.580> bunch<00:06:03.449> of<00:06:03.569> this<00:06:03.659> stuff<00:06:03.719> over<00:06:04.080> here<00:06:04.110> was

00:06:04.369 --> 00:06:04.379 
dollar bunch of this stuff over here was

00:06:04.379 --> 00:06:06.769 
dollar bunch of this stuff over here was
only<00:06:04.620> a<00:06:04.649> couple<00:06:04.889> dollars<00:06:05.089> that<00:06:06.089> i<00:06:06.120> was<00:06:06.449> looking

00:06:06.769 --> 00:06:06.779 
only a couple dollars that i was looking

00:06:06.779 --> 00:06:08.929

think it's going to cost like twenty

00:06:10.979 --> 00:06:13.490 
think it's going to cost like twenty
dollars<00:06:11.310> or<00:06:11.520> less<00:06:11.879> that's<00:06:12.120> not<00:06:12.330> bad<00:06:12.569> and<00:06:12.870> these
