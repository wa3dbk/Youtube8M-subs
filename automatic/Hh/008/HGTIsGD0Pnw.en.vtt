00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:12.250 
with those we're going to be using those

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:13.560 
with those we're going to be using those
patterns<00:01:12.580> and<00:01:12.909> all<00:01:13.000> three<00:01:13.330> of<00:01:13.360> these

patterns and all three of these

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:17.790 
patterns and all three of these
exercises<00:01:15.120> um<00:01:16.120> I<00:01:16.900> can't<00:01:17.409> think<00:01:17.500> of<00:01:17.590> anything

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:17.800 
exercises um I can't think of anything

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:21.870 
exercises um I can't think of anything
else<00:01:18.010> to<00:01:18.159> say<00:01:19.290> so<00:01:20.290> let's<00:01:20.440> just<00:01:20.620> begin<00:01:20.880> the

00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:21.880 
else to say so let's just begin the

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:25.710 
else to say so let's just begin the
first<00:01:22.500> lick<00:01:23.500> or<00:01:23.770> riff<00:01:24.130> really<00:01:24.760> uses<00:01:25.270> the<00:01:25.299> first

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:25.720 
first lick or riff really uses the first

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:29.430 
first lick or riff really uses the first
two<00:01:26.110> patterns<00:01:26.620> on<00:01:27.040> the<00:01:27.900> on<00:01:28.900> the<00:01:28.960> pattern

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:29.440 
two patterns on the on the pattern

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:31.800 
two patterns on the on the pattern
document<00:01:30.240> picture<00:01:31.240> whatever<00:01:31.540> you<00:01:31.630> want<00:01:31.750> to

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:31.810 
document picture whatever you want to

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:37.390 
document picture whatever you want to
call<00:01:31.900> it<00:01:32.550> which<00:01:33.550> would<00:01:33.730> be<00:01:33.850> this<00:01:34.030> one

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:37.400 

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:45.850 

and<00:01:38.410> this<00:01:39.410> one<00:01:43.720> now<00:01:44.720> what<00:01:45.050> we'll<00:01:45.200> be<00:01:45.320> doing<00:01:45.530> is

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:45.860 
and this one now what we'll be doing is

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:49.480 
and this one now what we'll be doing is
using<00:01:46.100> those<00:01:46.400> two<00:01:46.730> and<00:01:48.010> playing<00:01:49.010> them<00:01:49.160> twice

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:49.490 
using those two and playing them twice

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:51.430 
using those two and playing them twice
through<00:01:49.910> in<00:01:50.150> three<00:01:50.510> different<00:01:50.690> positions<00:01:51.290> on

through in three different positions on
the<00:01:51.740> neck<00:01:51.950> so<00:01:52.850> we'll<00:01:53.150> start<00:01:53.390> the<00:01:53.570> first

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:53.780 
the neck so we'll start the first

string play through twice then start the

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:20.090 
pattern one at the 10th again so it

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:42.199 
pattern one at the 10th again so it
should<00:02:20.240> sound<00:02:20.420> something<00:02:20.570> like<00:02:20.840> this

00:02:42.199 --> 00:02:42.209 

00:02:42.209 --> 00:02:46.530 

you<00:02:43.209> get<00:02:43.360> the<00:02:43.480> idea<00:02:43.540> um<00:02:45.330> practice<00:02:46.330> with<00:02:46.510> a

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:46.540 
you get the idea um practice with a

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:49.320 
you get the idea um practice with a
metronome<00:02:46.599> if<00:02:47.200> you<00:02:47.500> have<00:02:47.650> one<00:02:47.680> I<00:02:48.239> suggest<00:02:49.239> you

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:49.330 
metronome if you have one I suggest you

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:52.619 
metronome if you have one I suggest you
put<00:02:49.540> it<00:02:49.629> on<00:02:49.720> triplets<00:02:50.340> triplets<00:02:51.340> being<00:02:51.629> 123

00:02:52.619 --> 00:02:52.629 
put it on triplets triplets being 123

00:02:52.629 --> 00:02:56.309 
put it on triplets triplets being 123
123<00:02:53.140> 123<00:02:53.799> 123<00:02:54.519> 123<00:02:55.180> and<00:02:55.510> you<00:02:55.629> should<00:02:55.780> give<00:02:55.959> one

00:02:56.309 --> 00:02:56.319 
123 123 123 123 and you should give one

00:02:56.319 --> 00:02:59.640 
123 123 123 123 and you should give one
note<00:02:56.620> per<00:02:56.950> click<00:02:57.870> if<00:02:58.870> you<00:02:59.170> have<00:02:59.379> the<00:02:59.500> option

00:02:59.640 --> 00:02:59.650 
note per click if you have the option

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:03.449 
note per click if you have the option
depth<00:03:00.180> of<00:03:01.180> cut<00:03:01.420> the<00:03:02.410> gutta<00:03:02.680> and<00:03:02.920> I<00:03:03.040> just<00:03:03.190> put<00:03:03.370> it

00:03:03.449 --> 00:03:03.459 
depth of cut the gutta and I just put it

00:03:03.459 --> 00:03:06.870 
depth of cut the gutta and I just put it
yeah<00:03:03.610> you<00:03:04.209> get<00:03:04.390> the<00:03:04.510> idea<00:03:04.540> I<00:03:05.160> designed<00:03:06.160> most<00:03:06.700> of

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:06.880 
yeah you get the idea I designed most of

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:08.580 
yeah you get the idea I designed most of
these<00:03:07.030> to<00:03:07.269> be<00:03:07.390> played<00:03:07.630> in<00:03:07.660> triplets<00:03:08.200> mainly

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:08.590 
these to be played in triplets mainly

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:10.199 
these to be played in triplets mainly
because<00:03:08.739> they're<00:03:09.130> only<00:03:09.310> a<00:03:09.400> five<00:03:09.610> string<00:03:09.880> sweep

00:03:10.199 --> 00:03:10.209 
because they're only a five string sweep

00:03:10.209 --> 00:03:13.199 
because they're only a five string sweep
and<00:03:10.420> well<00:03:11.319> pretty<00:03:11.650> much<00:03:11.799> it<00:03:12.099> sounds<00:03:12.459> good<00:03:12.610> plus

00:03:13.199 --> 00:03:13.209 
and well pretty much it sounds good plus

00:03:13.209 --> 00:03:17.400 
and well pretty much it sounds good plus
it<00:03:13.450> kind<00:03:13.690> of<00:03:13.720> gives<00:03:13.840> it<00:03:13.959> that<00:03:14.049> whimsical<00:03:16.410> kind

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:17.410 
it kind of gives it that whimsical kind

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:20.759 
it kind of gives it that whimsical kind
of<00:03:17.500> a<00:03:17.680> demented<00:03:18.540> feel<00:03:19.540> to<00:03:19.810> it<00:03:19.840> I<00:03:20.170> don't<00:03:20.680> know

00:03:20.759 --> 00:03:20.769 
of a demented feel to it I don't know

00:03:20.769 --> 00:03:24.270 
of a demented feel to it I don't know
it's<00:03:21.040> very<00:03:21.310> helpful<00:03:21.610> one<00:03:22.170> and<00:03:23.170> now<00:03:23.379> there's<00:03:24.190> a

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:24.280

00:03:44.069 --> 00:03:44.079 
patterns one and four i believe which

00:03:44.079 --> 00:03:46.680 
patterns one and four i believe which
would<00:03:44.319> be<00:03:44.470> one<00:03:45.040> would<00:03:45.400> be<00:03:45.880> the<00:03:46.030> same<00:03:46.239> this<00:03:46.480> one

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:46.690 
would be one would be the same this one

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:50.860 
would be one would be the same this one
right<00:03:46.810> here

00:04:11.210 --> 00:04:11.220 
different position the first pattern

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:12.740 
different position the first pattern
we're<00:04:11.489> going<00:04:11.610> to<00:04:11.700> start<00:04:11.940> again<00:04:12.270> on<00:04:12.300> the<00:04:12.510> 10th

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:15.630 
fret and then the second pattern when we

00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:16.879 
fret and then the second pattern when we
move<00:04:15.810> to<00:04:15.900> the<00:04:15.959> second<00:04:16.230> pattern<00:04:16.470> will<00:04:16.590> start

00:04:16.879 --> 00:04:16.889 
move to the second pattern will start

00:04:16.889 --> 00:04:19.340 
move to the second pattern will start
the<00:04:17.250> first<00:04:17.489> note<00:04:17.700> in<00:04:17.880> the<00:04:18.299> ninth<00:04:18.510> fret<00:04:18.870> so<00:04:19.290> you

we're going to more or less put in a big
movement<00:05:10.039> between<00:05:10.400> the<00:05:11.229> two<00:05:12.229> positions<00:05:12.800> so

00:05:13.450 --> 00:05:13.460 
movement between the two positions so

00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:14.740 
movement between the two positions so
this<00:05:13.699> is<00:05:13.759> going<00:05:13.849> to<00:05:13.939> be<00:05:14.029> using<00:05:14.180> entire<00:05:14.539> league

00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:14.750 
this is going to be using entire league

00:05:14.750 --> 00:05:18.040 
this is going to be using entire league
pattern<00:05:15.110> 5<00:05:15.500> i<00:05:15.529> believe<00:05:16.069> i<00:05:16.840> think<00:05:17.840> it's<00:05:17.960> the

00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:18.050 
pattern 5 i believe i think it's the

00:05:18.050 --> 00:05:19.659 
pattern 5 i believe i think it's the
only<00:05:18.259> six<00:05:18.500> string<00:05:18.710> sweep<00:05:18.949> that<00:05:19.099> i<00:05:19.159> put<00:05:19.370> on<00:05:19.490> it

00:05:19.659 --> 00:05:19.669 
only six string sweep that i put on it

00:05:19.669 --> 00:05:22.179 
only six string sweep that i put on it
on<00:05:19.789> the<00:05:20.210> sweet<00:05:20.719> patterns<00:05:21.110> but<00:05:21.860> we're<00:05:22.039> going<00:05:22.129> to

00:05:22.179 --> 00:05:22.189 
on the sweet patterns but we're going to

00:05:22.189 --> 00:05:24.790 
on the sweet patterns but we're going to
be<00:05:22.340> put<00:05:22.550> playing<00:05:23.449> it<00:05:23.629> starting<00:05:24.050> in<00:05:24.259> the<00:05:24.500> 10th

00:05:24.790 --> 00:05:24.800 
be put playing it starting in the 10th

00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:27.939 
be put playing it starting in the 10th
fret<00:05:25.069> 6th<00:05:26.029> string<00:05:26.300> and<00:05:26.509> then<00:05:27.229> when<00:05:27.469> we<00:05:27.589> move<00:05:27.800> it

00:05:27.939 --> 00:05:27.949 
fret 6th string and then when we move it

00:05:27.949 --> 00:05:29.439 
fret 6th string and then when we move it
again<00:05:28.039> we're<00:05:28.400> going<00:05:28.490> to<00:05:28.580> be<00:05:28.699> putting<00:05:28.969> it<00:05:29.270> in

00:05:29.439 --> 00:05:29.449 
again we're going to be putting it in

00:05:29.449 --> 00:05:32.379 
again we're going to be putting it in
the<00:05:29.779> 14th<00:05:30.409> fret<00:05:30.680> on<00:05:30.860> the<00:05:30.949> sixth<00:05:31.520> string<00:05:31.580> so<00:05:32.360> it

00:05:32.379 --> 00:05:32.389 
the 14th fret on the sixth string so it

00:05:32.389 --> 00:05:51.010 
the 14th fret on the sixth string so it
just<00:05:32.629> it<00:05:32.779> should<00:05:33.169> sound<00:05:33.379> something<00:05:33.529> like<00:05:33.770> this
