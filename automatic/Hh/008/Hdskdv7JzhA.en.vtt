Zayn<00:02:15.010> for<00:02:15.160> the<00:02:15.220> NXT<00:02:15.490> title<00:02:15.580> was<00:02:16.210> absolutely

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:16.690 
Zayn for the NXT title was absolutely

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:18.120 
Zayn for the NXT title was absolutely
phenomenal<00:02:16.960> but<00:02:17.320> there<00:02:17.470> are<00:02:17.530> a<00:02:17.560> few<00:02:17.590> botches

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:18.130 
phenomenal but there are a few botches

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:20.100 
phenomenal but there are a few botches
there<00:02:18.250> was<00:02:18.340> some<00:02:18.640> miscommunication<00:02:18.850> and<00:02:19.600> once

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:20.110 
there was some miscommunication and once

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:22.320 
there was some miscommunication and once
again<00:02:20.230> you<00:02:20.470> know<00:02:20.590> on<00:02:20.830> occasions<00:02:21.640> you<00:02:22.210> know

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:22.330 
again you know on occasions you know

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:24.630 
again you know on occasions you know
maybe<00:02:22.510> there<00:02:22.750> should<00:02:22.870> be<00:02:22.960> a<00:02:22.990> whole<00:02:23.200> WWE<00:02:23.680> vs<00:02:24.220> NXT

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:24.640 
maybe there should be a whole WWE vs NXT

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:25.830 
maybe there should be a whole WWE vs NXT
think<00:02:24.850> maybe<00:02:25.000> they<00:02:25.300> should<00:02:25.480> build<00:02:25.660> toward

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:25.840 
think maybe they should build toward

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:27.150 
think maybe they should build toward
something<00:02:26.080> greater<00:02:26.380> maybe<00:02:26.590> something<00:02:26.980> more

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:27.160 
something greater maybe something more

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:28.740 
something greater maybe something more
