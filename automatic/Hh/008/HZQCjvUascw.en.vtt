enough<00:01:25.700> power<00:01:25.729> to<00:01:26.060> light<00:01:26.360> oliva<00:01:26.810> BTW<00:01:27.049> bulb<00:01:27.350> and

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:28.030 
enough power to light oliva BTW bulb and

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:32.280 
enough power to light oliva BTW bulb and
then<00:01:29.030> I<00:01:29.150> will<00:01:29.210> have<00:01:29.350> created<00:01:30.350> a<00:01:30.530> full-fledged

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:32.290 
then I will have created a full-fledged

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:38.320 
then I will have created a full-fledged
energy<00:01:33.290> producing<00:01:34.450> wind<00:01:35.450> mill

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:38.330 

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:42.280 

all<00:01:38.930> right<00:01:39.110> I<00:01:40.270> didn't<00:01:41.270> have<00:01:41.360> enough<00:01:41.600> Magnus<00:01:42.020> go

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:42.290 
all right I didn't have enough Magnus go

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:45.100 
all right I didn't have enough Magnus go
all<00:01:42.350> the<00:01:42.440> way<00:01:42.470> around<00:01:42.940> but<00:01:43.940> what<00:01:44.300> I<00:01:44.330> did<00:01:44.540> was<00:01:44.780> I

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:45.110 
all the way around but what I did was I

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:47.650 
all the way around but what I did was I
just<00:01:46.010> slid<00:01:46.370> the<00:01:46.520> magnet<00:01:46.910> between<00:01:47.240> these<00:01:47.450> two

00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:47.660 
just slid the magnet between these two

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:52.990 
just slid the magnet between these two
spokes<00:01:47.990> right<00:01:48.260> here<00:01:49.960> for<00:01:50.960> now<00:01:51.340> so<00:01:52.340> there's<00:01:52.520> six

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:53.000 
spokes right here for now so there's six

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:54.460 
spokes right here for now so there's six
of<00:01:53.150> them<00:01:53.210> there's<00:01:53.660> enough<00:01:53.900> room<00:01:53.930> for<00:01:54.350> three

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:54.470 
of them there's enough room for three

00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:57.430 
of them there's enough room for three
more<00:01:54.560> magnets<00:01:55.810> but<00:01:56.810> those<00:01:56.990> should<00:01:57.230> balance

00:01:57.430 --> 00:01:57.440 
more magnets but those should balance

00:01:57.440 --> 00:02:00.580 
more magnets but those should balance
out<00:01:57.800> and<00:01:58.780> give<00:01:59.780> me<00:01:59.870> a<00:01:59.900> start<00:02:00.230> point<00:02:00.410> they

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:00.590 
out and give me a start point they

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:01.780 
out and give me a start point they
didn't<00:02:00.740> have<00:02:00.890> any<00:02:01.070> more<00:02:01.250> than<00:02:01.400> round<00:02:01.580> ones

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:01.790 
didn't have any more than round ones

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:06.850 
didn't have any more than round ones
there<00:02:02.740> or<00:02:03.740> I<00:02:03.770> would<00:02:04.310> have<00:02:04.340> got<00:02:05.590> when<00:02:06.590> I<00:02:06.620> got

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:06.860 
there or I would have got when I got

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:08.590 
there or I would have got when I got
these<00:02:07.070> I'm<00:02:07.430> gonna<00:02:07.580> produce<00:02:07.760> the<00:02:08.030> table<00:02:08.390> needs

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:08.600 
these I'm gonna produce the table needs

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:10.719 
these I'm gonna produce the table needs
to<00:02:08.750> keep<00:02:08.840> them<00:02:09.020> in<00:02:09.110> place<00:02:09.399> and<00:02:10.399> what<00:02:10.520> I'm<00:02:10.610> going

00:02:10.719 --> 00:02:10.729 
to keep them in place and what I'm going

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:14.800 
to keep them in place and what I'm going
to<00:02:10.760> do<00:02:10.910> is<00:02:11.470> I'm<00:02:12.470> going<00:02:12.710> to<00:02:12.770> try<00:02:13.100> to<00:02:13.600> make<00:02:14.600> my

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:14.810 
to do is I'm going to try to make my

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:19.000 
to do is I'm going to try to make my
coil<00:02:15.170> on<00:02:16.010> this<00:02:16.520> bar<00:02:16.790> here<00:02:17.410> so<00:02:18.410> that<00:02:18.560> the<00:02:18.590> magnet

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:19.010 
coil on this bar here so that the magnet

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:23.590 
coil on this bar here so that the magnet
passes<00:02:19.490> right<00:02:19.730> by<00:02:20.260> the<00:02:21.260> coil<00:02:22.209> so<00:02:23.209> we'll<00:02:23.450> see

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:23.600 
passes right by the coil so we'll see

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:27.780 
passes right by the coil so we'll see
how<00:02:23.630> that<00:02:23.690> works<00:02:25.810> ok

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:27.790 
how that works ok

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:30.080 
how that works ok
well

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:30.090 
well

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:32.320 
well
the

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:32.330 
the

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:35.530 
the
the<00:02:32.690> maggots<00:02:33.140> didn't<00:02:33.410> work<00:02:33.590> so<00:02:34.340> well<00:02:34.370> I<00:02:34.820> took

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:35.540 
the maggots didn't work so well I took

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:38.200 
the maggots didn't work so well I took
them<00:02:35.870> in<00:02:35.990> the<00:02:36.110> house<00:02:36.260> I<00:02:36.880> tried<00:02:37.880> a<00:02:37.910> few

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:38.210 
them in the house I tried a few

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:41.470 
them in the house I tried a few
different<00:02:38.270> ideas<00:02:39.610> that<00:02:40.610> making<00:02:40.910> the<00:02:41.030> coil

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:41.480 
different ideas that making the coil

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:45.430 
different ideas that making the coil
like<00:02:41.840> this

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:45.440 

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:47.770 

this<00:02:46.100> to<00:02:46.670> see<00:02:46.850> if<00:02:46.880> I<00:02:47.030> could<00:02:47.090> get<00:02:47.270> a<00:02:47.330> tiny<00:02:47.630> little

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:47.780 
this to see if I could get a tiny little

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:52.980 
this to see if I could get a tiny little
voltage<00:02:48.370> but<00:02:49.370> I<00:02:49.640> suck<00:02:50.150> at<00:02:50.300> making<00:02:50.450> coils<00:02:51.310> so<00:02:52.310> I

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:52.990 
voltage but I suck at making coils so I

00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:56.260 
voltage but I suck at making coils so I
went<00:02:53.990> back<00:02:54.050> to<00:02:54.320> the<00:02:54.410> wig<00:02:54.560> eater<00:02:54.770> motor<00:02:55.060> this<00:02:56.060> is

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:56.270 
went back to the wig eater motor this is

00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:59.830 
went back to the wig eater motor this is
the<00:02:56.390> weedeater<00:02:56.780> motor<00:02:56.810> attempt<00:02:57.740> off<00:02:57.920> of<00:02:58.220> an<00:02:58.840> 18

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:07.500 
volt DC rechargeable wiener as you can
see<00:03:03.950> I've<00:03:04.130> got<00:03:04.310> it<00:03:04.430> hooked<00:03:04.670> to<00:03:05.440> these<00:03:06.440> leads

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:07.510 
see I've got it hooked to these leads

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:12.240 
see I've got it hooked to these leads
that<00:03:08.510> go<00:03:08.540> over<00:03:09.050> to<00:03:09.550> the<00:03:10.550> boat<00:03:10.730> mare<00:03:10.970> is<00:03:11.360> sat<00:03:11.870> on

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:12.250 
that go over to the boat mare is sat on

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:14.440 
that go over to the boat mare is sat on
can<00:03:13.250> already<00:03:13.340> see<00:03:13.610> it<00:03:13.670> but<00:03:13.790> it's<00:03:13.820> set<00:03:14.060> on<00:03:14.090> 12

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:14.450 
can already see it but it's set on 12

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:19.720 
can already see it but it's set on 12
volts<00:03:15.100> now<00:03:16.100> I'm<00:03:16.220> going<00:03:16.370> to<00:03:16.460> give<00:03:16.610> the<00:03:18.490> fan<00:03:19.490> of

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:19.730 
volts now I'm going to give the fan of

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:22.480 
volts now I'm going to give the fan of
spin<00:03:20.030> there<00:03:20.410> you<00:03:21.410> see<00:03:21.620> the<00:03:21.650> voltage<00:03:21.890> that's

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:22.490 
spin there you see the voltage that's

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:26.800 
spin there you see the voltage that's
slowly<00:03:22.700> going<00:03:23.000> back<00:03:23.180> down<00:03:23.420> at<00:03:23.660> a<00:03:23.690> stopping

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:26.810 

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:35.490 

alright<00:03:28.330> and<00:03:29.330> so<00:03:30.230> it<00:03:31.090> it<00:03:32.090> makes<00:03:32.330> voltage

00:03:35.490 --> 00:03:35.500 

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:38.430 

but<00:03:36.100> it<00:03:36.370> doesn't<00:03:36.580> time<00:03:36.970> oh<00:03:37.300> my<00:03:37.870> fingers<00:03:38.200> came

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:38.440 
but it doesn't time oh my fingers came

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:42.450 
but it doesn't time oh my fingers came
was<00:03:38.940> so<00:03:39.940> i'm<00:03:40.000> working<00:03:40.150> on<00:03:40.390> a<00:03:40.450> device<00:03:41.460> working

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:42.460 
was so i'm working on a device working

00:03:42.460 --> 00:03:45.750 
was so i'm working on a device working
on<00:03:42.670> an<00:03:42.760> idea<00:03:42.850> to<00:03:43.150> hold<00:03:43.390> this<00:03:43.600> in<00:03:43.840> place<00:03:44.760> with

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:45.760 
on an idea to hold this in place with

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:48.980 
on an idea to hold this in place with
the<00:03:45.910> least<00:03:46.120> amount<00:03:46.330> of<00:03:46.900> resistance<00:03:47.250> possible

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:48.990 
the least amount of resistance possible

00:03:48.990 --> 00:03:51.510 
the least amount of resistance possible
can<00:03:49.990> we<00:03:50.110> get<00:03:50.200> back<00:03:50.410> to<00:03:50.620> you<00:03:50.740> here<00:03:50.950> so<00:03:51.160> I<00:03:51.190> can<00:03:51.280> see

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:51.520 
can we get back to you here so I can see

00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:58.010 
can we get back to you here so I can see
what<00:03:51.670> I'm<00:03:51.760> gonna<00:03:51.880> do<00:03:53.250> okay<00:03:54.250> my<00:03:54.430> thoughts<00:03:54.730> are

00:03:58.010 --> 00:03:58.020 

00:03:58.020 --> 00:04:02.330 

basically<00:03:59.459> I've<00:04:00.459> got<00:04:00.670> this<00:04:00.880> to<00:04:01.090> where<00:04:01.270> it<00:04:01.420> just

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:02.340 
basically I've got this to where it just

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:07.860 
basically I've got this to where it just
here<00:04:03.340> come<00:04:03.520> some<00:04:03.760> win<00:04:04.080> see<00:04:06.330> Stan<00:04:07.330> got<00:04:07.600> enough

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:07.870 
here come some win see Stan got enough

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:14.729 
here come some win see Stan got enough
power<00:04:08.140> to<00:04:09.570> to<00:04:10.570> carry<00:04:10.959> it

00:04:14.729 --> 00:04:14.739 

00:04:14.739 --> 00:04:19.539 

hold<00:04:15.739> it<00:04:15.980> off<00:04:16.130> so<00:04:16.489> it<00:04:16.519> turn<00:04:17.470> way

00:04:19.539 --> 00:04:19.549 
hold it off so it turn way

00:04:19.549 --> 00:04:22.869 
hold it off so it turn way
ok<00:04:20.180> it's<00:04:20.359> it<00:04:20.599> to<00:04:20.750> where<00:04:20.930> it<00:04:21.079> rest<00:04:21.409> just<00:04:22.280> rest<00:04:22.639> on

00:04:22.869 --> 00:04:22.879 
ok it's it to where it rest just rest on

00:04:22.879 --> 00:04:28.330 
ok it's it to where it rest just rest on
the<00:04:23.030> wheel<00:04:23.470> and<00:04:26.169> as<00:04:27.169> you<00:04:27.409> can<00:04:27.560> see<00:04:27.800> you<00:04:28.039> can

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:28.340 
the wheel and as you can see you can

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:30.600 
the wheel and as you can see you can
even<00:04:28.550> spin<00:04:29.030> it<00:04:29.150> real<00:04:29.569> quick<00:04:29.840> here<00:04:30.110> and<00:04:30.259> it<00:04:30.349> was

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:30.610 
even spin it real quick here and it was

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:33.540 
even spin it real quick here and it was
little<00:04:31.610> slide<00:04:31.879> there<00:04:32.419> because<00:04:32.750> it's<00:04:32.930> just

00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:33.550 
little slide there because it's just

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:39.930 
little slide there because it's just
barely<00:04:34.550> resting<00:04:34.970> on<00:04:35.360> and<00:04:37.569> but<00:04:38.569> turning<00:04:39.259> this

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:39.940 
barely resting on and but turning this

00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:44.230 
barely resting on and but turning this
is<00:04:40.940> apparently<00:04:41.539> too<00:04:41.840> much<00:04:42.729> for<00:04:43.729> this<00:04:43.940> amount

00:04:44.230 --> 00:04:44.240 
is apparently too much for this amount

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:55.910 
is apparently too much for this amount
of<00:04:44.419> wind<00:04:44.569> surface<00:04:47.259> to<00:04:48.259> do<00:04:50.560> so

00:04:55.910 --> 00:04:55.920 

00:04:55.920 --> 00:04:59.300 

however<00:04:56.670> my<00:04:56.940> thoughts<00:04:57.300> are<00:04:58.040> what<00:04:59.040> if<00:04:59.160> i

00:04:59.300 --> 00:04:59.310 
however my thoughts are what if i

00:04:59.310 --> 00:05:03.620 
however my thoughts are what if i
increase<00:04:59.640> the<00:04:59.760> air<00:05:00.180> surface<00:05:02.390> the<00:05:03.390> blade

00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:03.630 
increase the air surface the blade

00:05:03.630 --> 00:05:09.270 
increase the air surface the blade
surface<00:05:03.960> on<00:05:04.320> these<00:05:04.470> blades<00:05:04.970> by<00:05:05.970> maybe

00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:09.280 

00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:16.100 

no<00:05:09.880> using<00:05:10.210> something

00:05:16.100 --> 00:05:16.110 

00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:22.740 

something<00:05:16.950> flat<00:05:18.320> right

00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:22.750 

00:05:22.750 --> 00:05:28.940 

and<00:05:23.050> then

00:05:28.940 --> 00:05:28.950 

00:05:28.950 --> 00:05:32.860 

maybe<00:05:29.580> using<00:05:29.880> something<00:05:30.270> flat<00:05:30.810> like<00:05:31.080> that<00:05:31.490> are

00:05:32.860 --> 00:05:32.870 
maybe using something flat like that are

00:05:32.870 --> 00:05:36.740 
maybe using something flat like that are
like<00:05:33.870> some<00:05:34.110> plastics<00:05:34.770> and<00:05:35.040> thin<00:05:35.220> plastic<00:05:35.750> and

00:05:36.740 --> 00:05:36.750 
like some plastics and thin plastic and

00:05:36.750 --> 00:05:39.640 
like some plastics and thin plastic and
then<00:05:37.410> poking<00:05:37.680> holes<00:05:37.950> through<00:05:38.340> the<00:05:38.370> plastic

00:05:39.640 --> 00:05:39.650 
then poking holes through the plastic

00:05:39.650 --> 00:05:42.110 
then poking holes through the plastic
tour<00:05:40.650> I<00:05:40.740> could<00:05:41.040> take<00:05:41.190> a<00:05:41.220> zip<00:05:41.520> tying<00:05:41.790> run

00:05:42.110 --> 00:05:42.120 
tour I could take a zip tying run

00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:44.600 
tour I could take a zip tying run
through<00:05:42.330> the<00:05:42.390> plastic<00:05:42.630> around<00:05:42.990> the<00:05:43.320> spoke<00:05:43.620> and

00:05:44.600 --> 00:05:44.610 
through the plastic around the spoke and

00:05:44.610 --> 00:05:47.690 
through the plastic around the spoke and
do<00:05:44.880> like<00:05:45.090> one<00:05:45.390> on<00:05:45.420> each<00:05:45.660> side<00:05:46.070> and<00:05:47.070> put<00:05:47.670> a

00:05:47.690 --> 00:05:47.700 
do like one on each side and put a

00:05:47.700 --> 00:05:52.090 
do like one on each side and put a
plastic<00:05:48.150> piece<00:05:48.420> there<00:05:48.720> all<00:05:49.620> the<00:05:49.920> way<00:05:49.950> around

00:05:52.090 --> 00:05:52.100 
plastic piece there all the way around

00:05:52.100 --> 00:05:56.420 
plastic piece there all the way around
to<00:05:53.100> add<00:05:53.280> some<00:05:53.730> big-time<00:05:54.630> one<00:05:54.960> surface<00:05:55.200> now<00:05:55.530> the

00:05:56.420 --> 00:05:56.430 
to add some big-time one surface now the

00:05:56.430 --> 00:05:59.000 
to add some big-time one surface now the
downside<00:05:56.610> of<00:05:56.940> that<00:05:57.090> is<00:05:57.240> I<00:05:57.800> would<00:05:58.800> have<00:05:58.890> to

00:05:59.000 --> 00:05:59.010 
downside of that is I would have to

00:05:59.010 --> 00:06:03.290 
downside of that is I would have to
reconfigure<00:05:59.310> my<00:06:00.680> my<00:06:01.680> rig<00:06:01.950> because<00:06:02.400> only<00:06:02.940> so

00:06:03.290 --> 00:06:03.300 
reconfigure my my rig because only so

00:06:03.300 --> 00:06:06.230 
reconfigure my my rig because only so
much<00:06:03.480> is<00:06:03.660> going<00:06:03.840> to<00:06:03.900> go<00:06:03.990> between<00:06:04.200> these<00:06:05.240> arms

00:06:06.230 --> 00:06:06.240 
much is going to go between these arms

00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:09.200 
much is going to go between these arms
so<00:06:06.830> although<00:06:07.830> i<00:06:07.980> already<00:06:08.430> have<00:06:08.610> discovered

00:06:09.200 --> 00:06:09.210 
so although i already have discovered

00:06:09.210 --> 00:06:12.530 
so although i already have discovered
and<00:06:10.400> determined<00:06:11.400> that<00:06:11.580> i<00:06:11.640> can<00:06:12.030> mount<00:06:12.330> this

00:06:12.530 --> 00:06:12.540 
and determined that i can mount this

00:06:12.540 --> 00:06:18.110 
and determined that i can mount this
wheel<00:06:13.460> outside<00:06:14.460> of<00:06:15.290> the<00:06:16.310> spokes<00:06:17.310> so<00:06:17.820> that<00:06:17.970> it's

00:06:18.110 --> 00:06:18.120 
wheel outside of the spokes so that it's

00:06:18.120 --> 00:06:21.410 
wheel outside of the spokes so that it's
only<00:06:18.300> on<00:06:18.540> one<00:06:18.570> for<00:06:19.490> giving<00:06:20.490> me<00:06:20.640> an<00:06:20.790> extra<00:06:21.090> side

00:06:21.410 --> 00:06:21.420 
only on one for giving me an extra side

00:06:21.420 --> 00:06:27.290 
only on one for giving me an extra side
they<00:06:21.720> can<00:06:21.900> have<00:06:22.080> any<00:06:22.290> depth<00:06:22.530> i<00:06:22.710> want<00:06:23.420> i<00:06:26.300> can

00:06:27.290 --> 00:06:27.300 
they can have any depth i want i can

00:06:27.300 --> 00:06:30.430 
they can have any depth i want i can
reconfigure<00:06:27.990> my<00:06:28.320> rig<00:06:28.590> to<00:06:28.920> be<00:06:29.130> repositioned<00:06:29.880> it

00:06:30.430 --> 00:06:30.440 
reconfigure my rig to be repositioned it

00:06:30.440 --> 00:06:34.460 
reconfigure my rig to be repositioned it
to<00:06:31.440> fit<00:06:31.650> that<00:06:31.860> type<00:06:32.100> of<00:06:32.130> mounting<00:06:32.700> as<00:06:33.060> well<00:06:33.470> but

00:06:34.460 --> 00:06:34.470 
to fit that type of mounting as well but

00:06:34.470 --> 00:06:38.090 
to fit that type of mounting as well but
the<00:06:34.620> next<00:06:34.920> step<00:06:35.160> i<00:06:35.310> guess<00:06:36.560> since<00:06:37.560> that<00:06:37.860> seems

00:06:38.090 --> 00:06:38.100 
the next step i guess since that seems

00:06:38.100 --> 00:06:41.960 
the next step i guess since that seems
to<00:06:38.310> work<00:06:38.520> good<00:06:38.790> just<00:06:39.630> needs<00:06:40.580> it<00:06:41.580> just<00:06:41.760> needs

00:06:41.960 --> 00:06:41.970 
to work good just needs it just needs

00:06:41.970 --> 00:06:44.810 
to work good just needs it just needs
more<00:06:42.060> surface<00:06:42.630> area

00:06:44.810 --> 00:06:44.820 
more surface area

00:06:44.820 --> 00:06:47.030 

the<00:06:45.360> next<00:06:45.630> step<00:06:45.810> I<00:06:45.990> guess<00:06:46.170> is<00:06:46.380> to<00:06:46.530> increase<00:06:46.770> the

00:06:47.030 --> 00:06:47.040 
the next step I guess is to increase the

00:06:47.040 --> 00:06:50.570 
the next step I guess is to increase the
blades<00:06:47.930> to<00:06:48.930> where<00:06:49.080> I<00:06:49.110> can<00:06:49.320> tour<00:06:50.040> the<00:06:50.070> wind<00:06:50.370> will

00:06:50.570 --> 00:06:50.580 
blades to where I can tour the wind will

00:06:50.580 --> 00:06:54.800 
blades to where I can tour the wind will
actually<00:06:51.290> move<00:06:52.290> this<00:06:52.560> thing
