00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
back down and see the controls are

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:26.359 
back down and see the controls are
acting<00:01:25.290> a<00:01:25.380> little<00:01:25.560> weird<00:01:25.860> here<00:01:26.070> and<00:01:26.220> there<00:01:26.340> but

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:26.369 
acting a little weird here and there but

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:28.580 
acting a little weird here and there but
this<00:01:27.150> is<00:01:27.270> how<00:01:27.330> you<00:01:27.390> type<00:01:27.689> your<00:01:27.720> ammo<00:01:27.990> type<00:01:28.290> so<00:01:28.530> I

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
this is how you type your ammo type so I

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:30.200 
this is how you type your ammo type so I
can<00:01:28.770> easily<00:01:28.890> switch<00:01:29.220> between<00:01:29.340> my<00:01:29.759> two<00:01:29.820> animal

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210 
can easily switch between my two animal

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:32.630 
can easily switch between my two animal
types<00:01:30.450> works<00:01:30.750> every<00:01:31.079> time<00:01:31.110> this<00:01:32.040> changes<00:01:32.579> my

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 
types works every time this changes my

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:34.640 
types works every time this changes my
view<00:01:32.820> shutter<00:01:33.329> it's<00:01:33.630> really<00:01:34.110> not<00:01:34.350> a<00:01:34.409> smart

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:34.650 
view shutter it's really not a smart

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:39.469 
view shutter it's really not a smart
idea<00:01:35.990> just<00:01:36.990> puts<00:01:37.200> it<00:01:37.320> back<00:01:37.470> up<00:01:38.060> periscope<00:01:39.060> view

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479 
idea just puts it back up periscope view

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:41.749 
idea just puts it back up periscope view
you<00:01:39.840> raise<00:01:40.020> a<00:01:40.049> hand<00:01:40.409> seems<00:01:41.220> to<00:01:41.310> work<00:01:41.520> pretty

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:41.759

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:50.009 
you can use it to switch views if you

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:52.460 
you can use it to switch views if you
want<00:01:50.600> see<00:01:51.600> everyone<00:01:51.899> smaller<00:01:52.140> control

00:02:57.920 --> 00:02:57.930 
decent I'd say the AI is kind of dumb I

decent I'd say the AI is kind of dumb I
mean<00:02:58.080> this<00:02:58.200> is<00:02:58.260> not<00:02:58.500> the<00:02:58.709> greatest<00:02:58.890> game<00:02:59.250> in

camera just to show you it's kind of

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:16.490 
camera just to show you it's kind of
cool<00:03:14.640> you<00:03:15.150> can<00:03:15.270> actually<00:03:15.450> play<00:03:16.020> from<00:03:16.470> your

00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:16.500 
cool you can actually play from your

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:18.199 
cool you can actually play from your
camera<00:03:16.830> so<00:03:17.070> if<00:03:17.130> your<00:03:17.250> viewport<00:03:17.700> gets<00:03:17.880> blown<00:03:18.180> up

00:03:18.199 --> 00:03:18.209 
camera so if your viewport gets blown up

00:03:18.209 --> 00:03:19.640 
camera so if your viewport gets blown up
you<00:03:18.450> actually<00:03:18.750> have<00:03:18.840> to<00:03:18.989> play<00:03:19.170> through<00:03:19.440> that

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:19.650 
you actually have to play through that

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:22.880 
you actually have to play through that
or<00:03:20.010> your<00:03:20.190> periscope<00:03:20.610> view<00:03:21.000> and<00:03:21.739> it's<00:03:22.739> pretty

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:22.890 
or your periscope view and it's pretty

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:25.910 
or your periscope view and it's pretty
difficult<00:03:23.190> so<00:03:23.670> yeah<00:03:23.850> I<00:03:24.120> actually<00:03:24.360> kind<00:03:24.780> of<00:03:24.920> the

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:25.920 
difficult so yeah I actually kind of the

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:27.740 
difficult so yeah I actually kind of the
game<00:03:26.130> so<00:03:26.400> difficult<00:03:26.820> i'm<00:03:27.000> not<00:03:27.150> a<00:03:27.180> huge<00:03:27.420> fan<00:03:27.540> of

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:27.750 
game so difficult i'm not a huge fan of

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:29.900 
game so difficult i'm not a huge fan of
it<00:03:27.989> in<00:03:28.140> some<00:03:28.200> ways<00:03:28.830> but<00:03:29.190> the<00:03:29.340> game's<00:03:29.550> very

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:29.910 
it in some ways but the game's very

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:31.610 
it in some ways but the game's very
playable<00:03:30.360> and<00:03:30.690> i<00:03:30.780> think<00:03:30.989> there's<00:03:31.140> a<00:03:31.200> kinect

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:31.620 
playable and i think there's a kinect

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:34.520 
playable and i think there's a kinect
bias<00:03:31.860> going<00:03:32.190> on<00:03:32.430> here<00:03:32.760> because<00:03:33.380> there's<00:03:34.380> some

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:34.530 
bias going on here because there's some

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:37.520 
bias going on here because there's some
guy<00:03:34.650> shooting<00:03:34.980> at<00:03:35.130> me<00:03:35.959> kill<00:03:36.959> these<00:03:37.110> guys<00:03:37.140> real

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:37.530 
guy shooting at me kill these guys real

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:40.699 
guy shooting at me kill these guys real
quick<00:03:37.560> but<00:03:38.010> you<00:03:38.400> know<00:03:39.350> this<00:03:40.350> mission<00:03:40.650> is

00:03:40.699 --> 00:03:40.709 
quick but you know this mission is

00:03:40.709 --> 00:03:41.750 
quick but you know this mission is
pretty<00:03:40.950> easy<00:03:41.160> it's<00:03:41.430> actually<00:03:41.670> the<00:03:41.730> same

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:41.760 
pretty easy it's actually the same

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:44.300 
pretty easy it's actually the same
mission<00:03:42.300> it's<00:03:42.420> in<00:03:42.540> the<00:03:42.630> demo<00:03:42.870> so<00:03:43.590> if<00:03:43.739> you<00:03:44.190> know

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:44.310 
mission it's in the demo so if you know

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:47.060 
mission it's in the demo so if you know
you<00:03:45.060> really<00:03:45.239> don't<00:03:45.420> believe<00:03:45.570> me<00:03:45.959> by<00:03:46.890> the<00:03:46.950> way<00:03:47.040> I

you really don't believe me by the way I

00:03:47.070 --> 00:03:50.590

you can see you can switch the ammo
types<00:05:58.160> very<00:05:58.520> easily<00:05:58.780> pretty<00:05:59.780> much

00:05:59.950 --> 00:05:59.960 
types very easily pretty much

00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:01.540 
types very easily pretty much
consistently<00:06:00.590> every<00:06:00.740> time<00:06:00.980> even<00:06:01.160> if<00:06:01.310> I<00:06:01.400> want

00:06:01.540 --> 00:06:01.550

00:06:01.550 --> 00:06:04.060 
consistently every time even if I want
to<00:06:01.580> use<00:06:01.700> my<00:06:01.730> other<00:06:01.940> hand<00:06:02.030> or<00:06:02.530> switching<00:06:03.530> yeah

00:06:04.060 --> 00:06:04.070 
to use my other hand or switching yeah

00:06:04.070 --> 00:06:05.770

yeah okay no there there goes for a

00:06:05.780 --> 00:06:08.170 
yeah okay no there there goes for a
second<00:06:06.110> time<00:06:06.230> but<00:06:07.100> you<00:06:07.220> know<00:06:07.340> I<00:06:07.670> usually<00:06:07.970> just

00:06:08.170 --> 00:06:08.180 
second time but you know I usually just

00:06:08.180 --> 00:06:10.780 
second time but you know I usually just
use<00:06:08.360> right<00:06:08.690> and<00:06:08.870> left<00:06:09.080> but<00:06:09.440> I<00:06:09.470> mean<00:06:09.790> doesn't

00:06:10.780 --> 00:06:10.790 
use right and left but I mean doesn't

00:06:10.790 --> 00:06:12.550 
use right and left but I mean doesn't
really<00:06:11.060> matter<00:06:11.270> does<00:06:11.420> it<00:06:11.630> you<00:06:12.140> know<00:06:12.260> I<00:06:12.290> mean

00:06:12.550 --> 00:06:12.560 
really matter does it you know I mean

00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:14.670 
really matter does it you know I mean
the<00:06:12.710> point<00:06:12.890> is<00:06:13.040> the<00:06:13.310> game<00:06:13.490> works<00:06:13.730> pretty<00:06:14.090> well

00:06:14.670 --> 00:06:14.680 
the point is the game works pretty well

00:06:14.680 --> 00:06:17.470 
the point is the game works pretty well
these<00:06:15.680> people<00:06:16.010> that<00:06:16.130> I<00:06:16.280> just<00:06:16.430> got<00:06:16.550> rock<00:06:16.820> is<00:06:17.180> it

00:06:17.470 --> 00:06:17.480 
these people that I just got rock is it

00:06:17.480 --> 00:06:18.999 
these people that I just got rock is it
standing<00:06:18.380> a<00:06:18.440> point

00:06:18.999 --> 00:06:19.009 
standing a point

00:06:19.009 --> 00:06:22.480 
standing a point
be<00:06:19.839> probably<00:06:20.839> not<00:06:20.990> a<00:06:21.050> smart<00:06:21.349> idea<00:06:21.499> but<00:06:22.069> you

00:06:22.480 --> 00:06:22.490 
be probably not a smart idea but you

00:06:22.490 --> 00:06:24.399 
be probably not a smart idea but you
know<00:06:22.639> the<00:06:23.240> point<00:06:23.629> is<00:06:23.749> that<00:06:23.779> controls<00:06:24.199> work

00:06:24.399 --> 00:06:24.409 
know the point is that controls work

00:06:24.409 --> 00:06:26.739 
know the point is that controls work
pretty<00:06:24.740> well<00:06:24.860> if<00:06:25.819> you<00:06:26.029> screw<00:06:26.270> up<00:06:26.330> it's

00:06:26.739 --> 00:06:26.749 
pretty well if you screw up it's

00:06:26.749 --> 00:06:28.749 
pretty well if you screw up it's
basically<00:06:27.289> on<00:06:27.559> you<00:06:27.800> I<00:06:27.979> think<00:06:28.219> goes<00:06:28.339> the<00:06:28.460> aai

00:06:28.749 --> 00:06:28.759 
basically on you I think goes the aai

00:06:28.759 --> 00:06:31.659 
basically on you I think goes the aai
walking<00:06:29.210> in<00:06:29.270> front<00:06:29.449> of<00:06:29.569> unshot<00:06:30.159> yeah<00:06:31.159> again

00:06:31.659 --> 00:06:31.669 
walking in front of unshot yeah again

00:06:31.669 --> 00:06:33.609 
walking in front of unshot yeah again
