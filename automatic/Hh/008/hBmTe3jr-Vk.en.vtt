00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.570
 source I'm giacomo and gives you the 

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:05.460
 welcome to this new installment of 

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:07.680
 I hate mania the column they come from 

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:09.420
 every Monday around 11 or at least there 

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:11.700
 try where we talk about how to improve 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:13.920
 the sound, the sound and the music inside 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:15.960
 of our videos and today we talk about how 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:19.130
 create or rather how to program a 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:19.130
 sila battery 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:29.070
 meanwhile I wanted to thank you because we are 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:31.769
 arrived almost a thousand inscriptions on 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:33.960
 channel so we are so many and therefore 

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:35.250
 most likely it will be released soon 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:37.440
 another contest 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:39.329
 meanwhile sonorized seen teaser is 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:41.610
 finished and finished you can no longer 

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:44.610
 participate and soon we will have the winner 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:46.739
 I think about like two weeks 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:48.660
 I anticipated you before today 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:50.850
 we'll talk about how to do it or better how 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:52.800
 program the battery this because in 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:55.500
 so many during the contest you have me 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:57.120
 asked but how do I sound one 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:59.070
 tool that does not know or that I do not have the 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:01.859
 possibility to play usually 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:03.000
 uses the rice ram raid tool 

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:05.850
 with a software that I already have 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.409
 mentioned the last episode therefore not 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:09.979
 let's get lost in small talk and go to 

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:12.630
 see how the tool works will see 

00:01:09.979 --> 00:01:14.280
 here we are in the reason interface 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:17.340
 first thing to do is I want you 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:22.500
 advise to definitely create a 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:25.380
 mixer so let's go to creates mixer 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:29.909
 so let's go create our king 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:31.380
 dram creates re dram dram computer 

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:33.530
 this tool you need 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:37.020
 basically to create bases 

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:38.880
 rhythm or batteries do not need 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:40.740
 of a minimal controller all comes 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:42.390
 controlled through the interface of 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:45.240
 rice 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:47.130
 let's connect it to the mixer in this 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:51.390
 always press the tab key 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:53.490
 you will see that you will see the link 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:56.040
 the first channel of the 

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:58.560
 mixer and then automatically here 

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:59.610
 we could check the volume of the 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:03.710
 our battery 

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:03.710
 let's see how the dram king is made 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:08.989
 as you can see it is possible to load several 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:11.690
 kit in our program 

00:02:08.989 --> 00:02:15.120
 every 

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:18.180
 let's go to open an example 

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:21.930
 will load a typical pop battery kit 

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:24.360
 kit and let's see what we have 

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:27.300
 we have the case on the first and snare drum 

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:29.670
 on the second on the third we have a 

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:31.290
 snare drum type like er core in 

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:37.350
 shop 

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:40.230
 here we have a tambourine here a tom a 

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:42.080
 another damage another and tom are put on 

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:44.580
 order then this will be the eardrum 

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:52.860
 eardrum 

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:56.459
 second tom first tom charleston for le 

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:58.620
 been opened and this should be a 

00:02:56.459 --> 00:03:01.350
 raid 

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:03.930
 obviously we can go to select 

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:06.569
 other battery parts also from others 

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:08.750
 kit to associate with one of these ten 

00:03:06.569 --> 00:03:12.750
 but let's do an experiment 

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:15.390
 so let's go and choose where it will play 

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:17.640
 the battery case is one thing 

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:20.750
 important so it will be going to 

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:23.250
 choose the rhythmic subdivision to do 

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:25.739
 reading the sequence was in this case 

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:28.709
 I set the sixteenth notes so it wants 

00:03:25.739 --> 00:03:32.880
 say that allow a box 

00:03:28.709 --> 00:03:38.910
 on the one of each quarter I will go to 

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:41.370
 place here on the first on the fifth on the 

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:47.780
 ninth and on the thirteenth 

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:50.070
 in fact if I put in play you will hear here 

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:51.780
 here 

00:03:50.070 --> 00:03:53.910
 now we are going to position the snare drum 

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:57.030
 so since we were on the track 

00:03:53.910 --> 00:04:01.220
 of the case we select the track of the 

00:03:57.030 --> 00:04:03.900
 this snare drum 

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:08.780
 maybe I'll use a soft dynamic for 

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:08.780
 the snare drum will go to pass on 3 

00:04:12.099 --> 00:04:20.690
 11 and 15 is practically going to send 

00:04:18.889 --> 00:04:27.280
 in play we will now hear that there are both 

00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:32.090
 classic rock time snare case 

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:36.979
 of the beginner this now we go 

00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:41.180
 to add a hi a hi are 

00:04:36.979 --> 00:04:43.520
 of the hi-hat is usually what 

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:45.500
 it sucks a little in the battery ghetto 

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:51.280
 then we select the track of the 

00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:54.550
 hi-hat and let's position it net 

00:04:51.280 --> 00:05:11.750
 consistently 

00:04:54.550 --> 00:05:13.490
 ok we obviously hear this is a fact 

00:05:11.750 --> 00:05:15.860
 simple harmotto but it's just to make you 

00:05:13.490 --> 00:05:18.169
 understand the mechanism once 

00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:21.169
 recorded the first pattern as you see 

00:05:18.169 --> 00:05:25.610
 here you have the possibility of warning of 

00:05:21.169 --> 00:05:28.450
 you can memorize eight different ones 

00:05:25.610 --> 00:05:31.580
 to choose the area where you want 

00:05:28.450 --> 00:05:35.030
 insert your pattern then 

00:05:31.580 --> 00:05:40.120
 placing the left locator and the 

00:05:35.030 --> 00:05:43.400
 right locator and right click 

00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:44.919
 click on pattern drac and garments 

00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:46.910
 obviously thanks to this tool 

00:05:44.919 --> 00:05:49.220
 to the use of different libraries 

00:05:46.910 --> 00:05:51.590
 he could come to create far more patterns 

00:05:49.220 --> 00:05:54.580
 complex like this here that you now 

00:05:51.590 --> 00:05:54.580
 let's hear that 

00:06:02.530 --> 00:06:07.510
 this is one of many ways to create or 

00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:09.530
 program an electronic battery 

00:06:07.510 --> 00:06:12.220
 personally that's what i find most 

00:06:09.530 --> 00:06:14.990
 simpler and more rapid because then 

00:06:12.220 --> 00:06:18.370
 this rai drama tool allows us 

00:06:14.990 --> 00:06:21.380
 to check the sound of each individual 

00:06:18.370 --> 00:06:23.600
 of every single piece of battery there 

00:06:21.380 --> 00:06:25.400
 lets you change the pitch of each 

00:06:23.600 --> 00:06:29.570
 single sound through the instrument 

00:06:25.400 --> 00:06:32.930
 beach to move queen unravel every 

00:06:29.570 --> 00:06:35.360
 single sound right to left then 

00:06:32.930 --> 00:06:38.030
 if we want to simulate the real listening of 

00:06:35.360 --> 00:06:40.570
 a battery we can place the 

00:06:38.030 --> 00:06:44.840
 snare drum more to the right than to 

00:06:40.570 --> 00:06:47.420
 the raid on the left is therefore one 

00:06:44.840 --> 00:06:49.460
 very comfortable tool to many 

00:06:47.420 --> 00:06:52.640
 other functions that you pay we will talk about again 

00:06:49.460 --> 00:06:55.220
 later on including the possibility of 

00:06:52.640 --> 00:06:57.590
 maybe connect a reverb to her 

00:06:55.220 --> 00:07:00.770
 only at the snare track or 

00:06:57.590 --> 00:07:02.600
 only at the cash desk ok here ends the 

00:07:00.770 --> 00:07:04.610
 first episode dedicated to the king dram 

00:07:02.600 --> 00:07:05.780
 probably there will be others e 

00:07:04.610 --> 00:07:08.810
 maybe we'll see how it is 

00:07:05.780 --> 00:07:11.120
 various effects apply to her 

00:07:08.810 --> 00:07:12.680
 individual pieces of the battery or over all 

00:07:11.120 --> 00:07:15.200
 the battery because slowly 

00:07:12.680 --> 00:07:18.650
 we will be able to build an entire column 

00:07:15.200 --> 00:07:20.390
 sound or even a fair piece of music 

00:07:18.650 --> 00:07:22.460
 I remind you that for all the problems with 

00:07:20.390 --> 00:07:24.680
 the audio you can contact me through 

00:07:22.460 --> 00:07:27.560
 phone book to help desk if you do n't know what 

00:07:24.680 --> 00:07:29.720
 what I talk click here and continue 

00:07:27.560 --> 00:07:31.850
 to follow the sequence transmissions 02 

00:07:29.720 --> 00:07:33.860
 well I hope the video was there 

00:07:31.850 --> 00:07:35.360
 useful I remind you that you can look for me either 

00:07:33.860 --> 00:07:37.340
 on facebook and on twitter 

00:07:35.360 --> 00:07:40.150
 I'm giacomo citro and certainly vi 

00:07:37.340 --> 00:07:40.150
 I will reply bye
