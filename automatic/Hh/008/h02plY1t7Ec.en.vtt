we're<00:03:19.220> going<00:03:19.370> to<00:03:19.610> use<00:03:20.440> what's<00:03:21.440> known<00:03:21.530> as<00:03:21.980> a

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:22.630 
we're going to use what's known as a

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:38.140 
we're going to use what's known as a
blind<00:03:23.630> rivet<00:03:33.340> hope<00:03:34.340> that<00:03:34.550> high<00:03:34.730> def<00:03:37.150> shorter

blind rivet hope that high def shorter
so<00:03:39.080> I<00:03:39.140> have<00:03:39.290> to<00:03:39.470> do<00:03:39.590> the<00:03:39.740> reef<00:03:39.920> Larry<00:03:41.050> layering

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:42.050 
so I have to do the reef Larry layering

00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:45.100 
so I have to do the reef Larry layering
difficulty<00:03:43.040> is<00:03:43.220> I<00:03:43.610> did<00:03:44.390> all<00:03:44.510> that<00:03:44.720> here<00:03:45.020> in

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:45.110 
difficulty is I did all that here in

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:47.710 
difficulty is I did all that here in
this<00:03:45.200> larry<00:03:45.560> device<00:03:46.000> but<00:03:47.000> now<00:03:47.239> it<00:03:47.510> will<00:03:47.600> have

00:03:47.710 --> 00:03:47.720 
this larry device but now it will have

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:49.540 
this larry device but now it will have
to<00:03:47.840> be<00:03:47.870> that<00:03:48.080> inside<00:03:48.770> the<00:03:48.980> plane<00:03:49.190> which<00:03:49.430> is

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:49.550 
to be that inside the plane which is

00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:56.410 
to be that inside the plane which is
like<00:03:49.730> amazing<00:03:53.500> wish<00:03:54.500> me<00:03:54.739> luck<00:03:54.850> have<00:03:55.850> no<00:03:56.120> idea

00:03:56.410 --> 00:03:56.420 
like amazing wish me luck have no idea

00:03:56.420 --> 00:04:19.350 
like amazing wish me luck have no idea
how<00:03:56.570> deep<00:03:56.780> this<00:03:56.930> goes

00:04:19.350 --> 00:04:19.360 

00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:23.550 

there's<00:04:20.360> this<00:04:20.810> was<00:04:21.019> filled<00:04:21.320> with<00:04:21.700> silicone

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:23.560 
there's this was filled with silicone

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:26.080 
there's this was filled with silicone
and<00:04:24.560> I<00:04:24.710> didn't<00:04:24.980> know<00:04:25.070> how<00:04:25.100> if<00:04:25.820> they're

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:26.090 
and I didn't know how if they're

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:27.250 
and I didn't know how if they're
actually<00:04:26.480> be<00:04:26.600> a<00:04:26.630> hole<00:04:26.810> all<00:04:27.020> the<00:04:27.050> way<00:04:27.200> through

00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:27.260 
actually be a hole all the way through

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:28.960 
actually be a hole all the way through
and<00:04:27.680> I<00:04:27.770> have<00:04:28.040> to<00:04:28.160> have<00:04:28.250> all<00:04:28.370> the<00:04:28.640> way<00:04:28.700> through

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:28.970 
and I have to have all the way through

00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:32.860 
and I have to have all the way through
otherwise<00:04:29.270> the<00:04:29.510> pop<00:04:29.810> rivet<00:04:30.110> can't<00:04:30.380> grab<00:04:31.870> but

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:32.870 
otherwise the pop rivet can't grab but

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:37.180 
otherwise the pop rivet can't grab but
it<00:04:32.960> looks<00:04:33.110> pretty<00:04:33.170> good<00:04:35.440> pitot<00:04:36.440> tube<00:04:36.800> is<00:04:36.980> the

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:37.190 
it looks pretty good pitot tube is the

it looks pretty good pitot tube is the
airspeed<00:04:37.520> indicator<00:04:39.160> sensing<00:04:40.160> device<00:04:42.520> goes

00:04:43.510 --> 00:04:43.520 
airspeed indicator sensing device goes

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:46.630 
airspeed indicator sensing device goes
underneath<00:04:43.910> the<00:04:44.150> wing<00:04:44.330> like<00:04:44.570> this<00:04:45.340> so<00:04:46.340> as<00:04:46.490> the

00:04:46.630 --> 00:04:46.640 
underneath the wing like this so as the

00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:48.190 
underneath the wing like this so as the
air<00:04:46.760> comes<00:04:47.090> in<00:04:47.300> you've<00:04:47.600> seen<00:04:47.780> you<00:04:47.870> see<00:04:48.080> them

00:04:48.190 --> 00:04:48.200 
air comes in you've seen you see them

00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:49.590 
air comes in you've seen you see them
underneath<00:04:48.440> every<00:04:48.770> wing<00:04:48.920> of<00:04:49.070> every<00:04:49.280> airplane

00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:49.600 
underneath every wing of every airplane

underneath every wing of every airplane
as<00:04:50.600> the<00:04:50.840> air<00:04:50.990> comes<00:04:51.320> in<00:04:51.560> forces<00:04:52.250> through<00:04:52.490> there

00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:52.610 
as the air comes in forces through there

00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:55.210 
as the air comes in forces through there
comes<00:04:52.880> up<00:04:53.090> through<00:04:53.270> this<00:04:53.390> tube<00:04:53.690> and<00:04:54.260> goes<00:04:54.920> into

00:04:55.210 --> 00:04:55.220 
comes up through this tube and goes into

fast you're going the other tube is
called<00:04:59.000> an<00:04:59.120> angle<00:04:59.420> of<00:04:59.450> attack<00:04:59.570> tube<00:05:00.080> and<00:05:00.820> which

00:05:01.810 --> 00:05:01.820 
called an angle of attack tube and which

00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:04.840 
called an angle of attack tube and which
is<00:05:02.090> activated<00:05:02.780> by<00:05:02.810> this<00:05:03.080> little<00:05:03.320> hole<00:05:03.440> here<00:05:03.850> so

you're if you're going too steep of an
incline<00:05:09.080> and<00:05:09.590> you<00:05:09.950> could<00:05:10.070> possibly<00:05:10.250> skull

00:05:10.810 --> 00:05:10.820 
incline and you could possibly skull

00:05:10.820 --> 00:05:15.190 
incline and you could possibly skull
Hill<00:05:11.740> it'll<00:05:12.740> set<00:05:12.980> off<00:05:13.010> a<00:05:13.130> signal<00:05:14.200> orange

inside you're playing analysts say it
too<00:05:17.930> too<00:05:18.410> much<00:05:18.440> angle<00:05:18.950> of<00:05:19.040> attack<00:05:19.180> so<00:05:20.180> when

00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:20.330 
too too much angle of attack so when

00:05:20.330 --> 00:05:23.170 
too too much angle of attack so when
you're<00:05:20.450> coming<00:05:20.690> in<00:05:20.810> for<00:05:20.990> landing<00:05:21.400> you<00:05:22.400> can<00:05:22.610> can

adjust your angle of attack just so so

00:05:25.820 --> 00:05:27.910 
adjust your angle of attack just so so
that<00:05:25.970> you<00:05:26.090> get<00:05:26.270> you<00:05:26.960> can<00:05:27.140> slow<00:05:27.350> down<00:05:27.530> enough<00:05:27.860> to

00:05:27.910 --> 00:05:27.920 
that you get you can slow down enough to

00:05:27.920 --> 00:05:30.430 
that you get you can slow down enough to
land<00:05:28.220> perfectly<00:05:28.600> if<00:05:29.600> you<00:05:29.750> didn't<00:05:30.020> have<00:05:30.140> that<00:05:30.410> I

00:05:30.430 --> 00:05:30.440 
land perfectly if you didn't have that I

00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:31.750 
land perfectly if you didn't have that I
now<00:05:30.830> I<00:05:30.860> pick<00:05:31.130> a<00:05:31.160> lot<00:05:31.280> of<00:05:31.370> people<00:05:31.550> don't<00:05:31.700> have

00:05:31.750 --> 00:05:31.760 
now I pick a lot of people don't have

00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:33.340 
now I pick a lot of people don't have
angle<00:05:32.150> of<00:05:32.210> attack<00:05:32.300> instruments<00:05:33.080> but<00:05:33.170> if<00:05:33.290> you

00:05:33.340 --> 00:05:33.350 
angle of attack instruments but if you

00:05:33.350 --> 00:05:35.080 
angle of attack instruments but if you
don't<00:05:33.500> have<00:05:33.680> it<00:05:33.830> and<00:05:34.040> then<00:05:34.669> you're<00:05:34.850> sort<00:05:35.030> of

00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:35.090 
don't have it and then you're sort of

00:05:35.090 --> 00:05:37.870 
don't have it and then you're sort of
guessing<00:05:35.330> as<00:05:35.630> to<00:05:35.660> how<00:05:35.960> how<00:05:36.919> to<00:05:36.980> win<00:05:37.490> the<00:05:37.610> flare

00:05:37.870 --> 00:05:37.880 
guessing as to how how to win the flare

00:05:37.880 --> 00:05:40.570 
guessing as to how how to win the flare
and<00:05:38.090> all<00:05:38.210> that<00:05:38.450> this<00:05:39.410> way<00:05:39.590> you<00:05:40.040> can<00:05:40.100> you<00:05:40.460> can

00:05:40.570 --> 00:05:40.580 
and all that this way you can you can

00:05:40.580 --> 00:05:42.130 
and all that this way you can you can
make<00:05:40.790> much<00:05:41.030> better<00:05:41.060> landings<00:05:41.810> because<00:05:42.050> you

00:05:42.130 --> 00:05:42.140 
make much better landings because you

00:05:42.140 --> 00:05:44.320 
make much better landings because you
know<00:05:42.260> exactly<00:05:42.290> how<00:05:42.770> much<00:05:42.890> to<00:05:43.100> flare<00:05:43.370> and<00:05:43.640> how

00:05:44.320 --> 00:05:44.330 
know exactly how much to flare and how

00:05:44.330 --> 00:05:46.750 
know exactly how much to flare and how
much<00:05:44.540> then<00:05:44.750> how<00:05:44.870> to<00:05:45.040> control<00:05:46.040> your<00:05:46.190> speed<00:05:46.520> as

00:05:46.750 --> 00:05:46.760 
much then how to control your speed as

00:05:46.760 --> 00:06:19.959 
much then how to control your speed as
your<00:05:46.910> landing

00:06:19.959 --> 00:06:19.969 

00:06:19.969 --> 00:06:24.049 

click<00:06:20.969> on<00:06:21.149> the<00:06:21.329> other<00:06:21.449> side<00:06:22.519> and<00:06:23.519> I'm<00:06:23.759> hoping

00:06:24.049 --> 00:06:24.059 
click on the other side and I'm hoping

00:06:24.059 --> 00:06:28.039 
click on the other side and I'm hoping
that<00:06:24.269> these<00:06:25.759> that<00:06:26.759> the<00:06:27.029> actual<00:06:27.389> pop<00:06:27.689> Reba's

00:06:28.039 --> 00:06:28.049 
that these that the actual pop Reba's

00:06:28.049 --> 00:06:29.779 
that these that the actual pop Reba's
aren't<00:06:28.289> so<00:06:28.469> long<00:06:28.709> that<00:06:28.919> they'll<00:06:29.129> hit<00:06:29.759> each

00:06:29.779 --> 00:06:29.789 
aren't so long that they'll hit each

00:06:29.789 --> 00:06:40.189 
aren't so long that they'll hit each
other<00:06:31.219> my<00:06:32.219> concerns<00:06:38.629> absolute<00:06:39.629> proof<00:06:39.809> it<00:06:39.989> can

other my concerns absolute proof it can
