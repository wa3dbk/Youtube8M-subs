00:00:11.510 --> 00:00:14.720 
electrolysis of copper chloride
electrolysis<00:00:12.510> is<00:00:12.990> a<00:00:13.049> process<00:00:13.709> by<00:00:13.920> which<00:00:13.949> ionic

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:14.730 
electrolysis is a process by which ionic

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:17.029 
electrolysis is a process by which ionic
substances<00:00:15.480> that<00:00:16.139> have<00:00:16.260> been<00:00:16.439> dissolved<00:00:16.920> in

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:17.039 
substances that have been dissolved in

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:20.960 
substances that have been dissolved in
water<00:00:17.250> or<00:00:18.000> melted<00:00:18.689> or<00:00:19.289> decomposed<00:00:19.970> broken

the mass of copper chloride was used

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:41.900 
the mass of copper chloride was used

half the mass of chlorine gas is

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:51.380 
half the mass of chlorine gas is
produced<00:02:49.130> so<00:02:50.130> that's<00:02:50.310> thirty<00:02:50.730> five<00:02:51.060> point
