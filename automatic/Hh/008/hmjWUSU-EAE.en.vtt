00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:03.220
 It was a short time since we talked about America 

00:00:03.220 --> 00:00:07.259
 The unmanned aircraft program The Associated Press reported 

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:10.300
 That the missiles fired by a US drone 

00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:15.170
 A caravan of cars was already going to a wedding 

00:00:15.170 --> 00:00:15.860
 party 

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:21.810
 In central Yemen, killing at least 13 people, according to Yemeni security 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:23.240
 Officials 

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:26.300
 The official said the attack took place in a city 

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:29.960
 To read Da love capital by Dow County 

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:35.170
 The bodies were left charred and burnt cars on the road now in the city is 

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:37.620
 Is a stronghold of al-Qaeda 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:41.070
 Hardcore There is real doubt about it 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:47.329
 But the question here is whether any of the militants were actually killed 

00:00:47.329 --> 00:00:52.430
 Or whether all civilians were not involved in any kind of militants 

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:55.030
 Work out any immediate details about who it was 

00:00:55.030 --> 00:01:00.219
 Killed in a raid conflicting reports about whether there were any gunmen 

00:01:00.219 --> 00:01:03.910
 On all travelers with the wedding caravan 

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:08.520
 A military official said preliminary information indicates that the drone 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:11.760
 Mistaken at the wedding of al-Qaeda 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:15.380
 Boy Kom said the tribesmen are known to the villagers 

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:20.310
 However they were among the dead and one of three security officials said that i 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:20.640
 cud 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:24.700
 They are suspected of belonging to al-Qaeda because I have been traveling 

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:29.340
 With a wedding procession this is a very very interesting Louis to 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:33.100
 The number one in the United States does not recognize the existence 

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:37.390
 It has a UAV program in Yemen but it is usually not addressed 

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:43.009
 Individual strikes if more investigation ends identify victims 

00:01:43.009 --> 00:01:44.470
 They were all civilians 

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:48.540
 This could fuel a dangerous spate of Bangor and we talked to Lewis 

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:51.560
 This could be two issues around the issue of UAVs 1 

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:55.850
 When we say rather than drones we should not do anything that is 

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:58.119
 Realistic and any they are not realistic at all 

00:01:58.119 --> 00:02:02.360
 If we do not use drones in some scenarios we will do other things 

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:05.549
 And other things that may lead to more deaths and not less 

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:09.379
 Another issue though Lewis is whether the unmanned program is disconnected from 

00:02:09.379 --> 00:02:11.069
 What alternatives will be 

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:15.459
 Is to create more enemies for the United States then is eliminated 

00:02:15.459 --> 00:02:19.620
 This seems likely to be one of those situations where the answer would be 

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:20.340
 Be Yes 

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:23.819
 Separately of course I imagined 

00:02:23.819 --> 00:02:27.930
 Many billion people get angry when something like this happens when they are 

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:28.720
 Just 

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:32.900
 Missiles are essentially missiles from the United States by blowing people up at 

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:33.690
 Their country 

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:36.900
 I'm 8 it's never clear 

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:39.940
 We will have a positive affect on relations 

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:43.290
 With other countries because that seems impossible to me 

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:47.120
 Of course there is the question of how the US will react if it strikes 

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:50.810
 They are carried out by other nations and here I think that casts 

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:54.860
 Immediate absurdity of shadow 

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:58.480
 Overall on politics but there is something else here which is if you look 

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:00.069
 In the language that was used 

00:03:00.069 --> 00:03:03.739
 A military official said the drone 

00:03:03.739 --> 00:03:06.909
 Mistaken at the wedding of al-Qaeda 

00:03:06.909 --> 00:03:12.090
 Al Qaeda con drones con not wrong anyone n 

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:15.650
 That operator who made a mistake is that 

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:19.569
 Another piece of evidence suggests that the UAV war 

00:03:19.569 --> 00:03:24.680
 The operator further removes the fact that you are a person 

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:27.709
 Controlling a drone kills people in 

00:03:27.709 --> 00:03:31.370
 Well the unmanned caravan missed that Louis 

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:35.720
 Even without the intention to show us exactly what we should be concerned about 

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:37.379
 About these with drone attacks 

00:03:37.379 --> 00:03:41.280
 It also shows us that this army 

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:44.519
 It is just something because there they are ready to lie 

00:03:44.519 --> 00:03:48.540
 The information you get in this case 

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:51.670
 It is really shady kinda there is a lot of strange language 

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:54.849
 There is ata I do not know 

00:03:54.849 --> 00:03:58.950
 General 

00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:02.700
 I do not know what you call control control comments that just do not really 

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:06.549
 Do not really give us any answers yet there's basically you remember how 

00:04:06.549 --> 00:04:08.080
 In Nelson Mandela 

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:12.439
 A memorial there was that sign language interpreter 

00:04:12.439 --> 00:04:16.570
 Which was something to communicate with the signs that he used it for 

00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:19.900
 Apparently they were loose in helping or something like that which made statements 

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:24.740
 We get about UAV attacks and the UAV program there are lyrics used but 

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:28.300
 They communicate something a lot the same way 

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:31.630
 Yes I mean what we really learned from this and we have no idea if they are 

00:04:31.630 --> 00:04:33.270
 They actually thought they were 

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:36.470
 Al Qaeda operatives here or here if the total of incidents only
