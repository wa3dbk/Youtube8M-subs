demonstrate<00:00:09.210> a<00:00:09.510> few<00:00:09.780> different<00:00:09.990> ways<00:00:10.320> of

00:00:10.669 --> 00:00:10.679 
demonstrate a few different ways of

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:13.580 
demonstrate a few different ways of
arranging<00:00:11.099> the<00:00:11.610> screens<00:00:12.000> for<00:00:12.480> the<00:00:12.509> video<00:00:13.110> here

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:13.590 
arranging the screens for the video here

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:15.379 
arranging the screens for the video here
because<00:00:14.130> a<00:00:14.160> lot<00:00:14.490> of<00:00:14.519> people<00:00:14.639> said<00:00:15.150> that<00:00:15.330> they

00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:15.389 
because a lot of people said that they

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:18.050 
because a lot of people said that they
didn't<00:00:15.960> care<00:00:16.139> for<00:00:16.170> the<00:00:16.470> raw<00:00:17.220> source<00:00:17.670> smile

am going to demonstrate how time travel
works<00:00:33.149> in<00:00:33.600> a<00:00:33.660> side<00:00:34.020> quests<00:00:34.649> how<00:00:34.770> you<00:00:34.829> have<00:00:35.040> to

how<00:00:48.120> there's<00:00:48.480> that<00:00:48.660> staircase<00:00:48.989> going<00:00:49.469> right

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:49.770 
how there's that staircase going right

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:52.369 
how there's that staircase going right
up<00:00:49.800> the<00:00:50.070> middle<00:00:50.219> there<00:00:50.520> where<00:00:51.090> it<00:00:51.449> was<00:00:51.660> you

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
up the middle there where it was you

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:55.010 
up the middle there where it was you
know<00:00:52.550> disjointed<00:00:53.550> like<00:00:53.940> that<00:00:54.180> that's<00:00:54.660> because

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020 
know disjointed like that that's because

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:56.630 
know disjointed like that that's because
when<00:00:55.289> you're<00:00:55.410> playing<00:00:55.590> on<00:00:55.739> the<00:00:55.860> original<00:00:56.280> vs

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
when you're playing on the original vs

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:58.729 
when you're playing on the original vs
it<00:00:56.969> expects<00:00:57.510> the<00:00:57.719> two<00:00:57.870> screens<00:00:58.170> there<00:00:58.500> to<00:00:58.590> be<00:00:58.710> a

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
it expects the two screens there to be a

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:01.700 
it expects the two screens there to be a
gap<00:00:59.129> in<00:00:59.430> there<00:00:59.760> which<00:01:00.120> there<00:01:00.570> is<00:01:00.719> it<00:01:00.870> now

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
gap in there which there is it now

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:03.920 
gap in there which there is it now
here's<00:01:01.890> another<00:01:02.160> method<00:01:02.670> that<00:01:02.820> was<00:01:03.690> brought

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
here's another method that was brought

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:07.039 
here's another method that was brought
to<00:01:03.960> my<00:01:04.080> attention<00:01:04.140> by<00:01:04.650> Necroscope<00:01:05.580> 86<00:01:06.360> where

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049 
to my attention by Necroscope 86 where

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:09.980 
to my attention by Necroscope 86 where
he<00:01:07.619> enlarges<00:01:08.220> the<00:01:08.580> main<00:01:08.909> screen<00:01:09.420> so<00:01:09.750> that<00:01:09.810> way

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
he enlarges the main screen so that way

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:11.929 
he enlarges the main screen so that way
it's<00:01:10.140> easier<00:01:10.500> to<00:01:10.590> see<00:01:10.830> but<00:01:11.340> then<00:01:11.460> he<00:01:11.549> puts<00:01:11.729> the

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:11.939 
it's easier to see but then he puts the

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:14.120 
it's easier to see but then he puts the
sub<00:01:12.150> screen<00:01:12.570> on<00:01:12.900> the<00:01:13.260> right<00:01:13.290> there<00:01:13.740> which<00:01:13.979> is

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
sub screen on the right there which is

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:16.039 
sub screen on the right there which is
smaller<00:01:14.400> because<00:01:14.700> I<00:01:14.850> mean<00:01:15.060> well<00:01:15.509> for<00:01:15.869> the<00:01:15.930> most

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049 
smaller because I mean well for the most

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:18.260 
smaller because I mean well for the most
part<00:01:16.170> you<00:01:16.530> don't<00:01:16.619> really<00:01:16.799> care<00:01:17.189> about<00:01:17.340> it<00:01:17.670> but

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270 
part you don't really care about it but

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:20.870 
part you don't really care about it but
I<00:01:18.509> like<00:01:18.900> having<00:01:19.380> such<00:01:19.619> the<00:01:20.070> Sun<00:01:20.310> screen<00:01:20.549> there

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
I like having such the Sun screen there

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:24.030 
I like having such the Sun screen there
so<00:01:21.420> that<00:01:21.450> way<00:01:21.780> you<00:01:21.840> can

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:24.040 
so that way you can

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:26.560 
so that way you can
you<00:01:25.040> know<00:01:25.130> see<00:01:25.490> what's<00:01:25.670> going<00:01:25.880> on<00:01:26.000> there<00:01:26.360> I'm

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:26.570 
you know see what's going on there I'm

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:29.170 
you know see what's going on there I'm
accessing<00:01:26.990> the<00:01:27.200> menu<00:01:27.620> or<00:01:27.950> safe<00:01:28.880> during<00:01:29.120> your

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:29.180 
accessing the menu or safe during your

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:32.410 
accessing the menu or safe during your
cutscene<00:01:29.690> that<00:01:29.870> uses<00:01:30.320> both<00:01:31.070> screens<00:01:31.940> here<00:01:32.270> so

00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:32.420 
cutscene that uses both screens here so

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:34.390 
cutscene that uses both screens here so
that<00:01:32.570> way<00:01:32.690> at<00:01:32.869> least<00:01:32.900> you<00:01:33.260> see<00:01:33.560> it<00:01:33.680> but<00:01:34.280> an

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:34.400 
that way at least you see it but an

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:36.340 
that way at least you see it but an
enlarged<00:01:34.760> at<00:01:34.940> the<00:01:35.060> main<00:01:35.240> screen<00:01:35.600> so<00:01:35.990> that<00:01:36.020> way

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:36.350 
enlarged at the main screen so that way

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:40.300 
enlarged at the main screen so that way
you<00:01:37.010> can<00:01:37.840> grieve<00:01:38.840> everything<00:01:39.800> didn't<00:01:40.130> see

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:40.310 
you can grieve everything didn't see

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:43.150 
you can grieve everything didn't see
everything<00:01:40.729> that's<00:01:41.119> rather<00:01:41.690> important<00:01:42.410> the

00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:43.160 
everything that's rather important the

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:45.040 
everything that's rather important the
only<00:01:43.400> problem<00:01:43.670> I<00:01:43.850> have<00:01:44.060> with<00:01:44.090> this<00:01:44.330> one<00:01:44.690> or<00:01:44.930> the

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:45.050 
only problem I have with this one or the

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:46.840 
only problem I have with this one or the
main<00:01:45.229> problem<00:01:45.590> I<00:01:45.650> have<00:01:45.770> with<00:01:45.800> it<00:01:46.009> is<00:01:46.190> that<00:01:46.460> lets

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:46.850 
main problem I have with it is that lets

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:48.580 
main problem I have with it is that lets
say<00:01:46.970> there's<00:01:47.210> a<00:01:47.270> cut<00:01:47.479> a<00:01:47.509> bitch<00:01:47.930> cutscene<00:01:48.440> with

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:48.590 
say there's a cut a bitch cutscene with

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:50.920 
say there's a cut a bitch cutscene with
that<00:01:48.740> utilizes<00:01:49.369> both<00:01:49.400> screens<00:01:50.150> one<00:01:50.540> on<00:01:50.659> top<00:01:50.900> of

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:55.280 
air you know that wouldn't really work

or wipes just you know I here's another

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:08.199 
or wipes just you know I here's another
method<00:02:06.470> that<00:02:06.500> I<00:02:06.619> think<00:02:06.920> I<00:02:07.039> do<00:02:07.100> like<00:02:07.490> also<00:02:08.000> made

00:02:08.199 --> 00:02:08.209 
method that I think I do like also made

00:02:08.209 --> 00:02:11.800 
method that I think I do like also made
by<00:02:08.479> a<00:02:08.509> green<00:02:09.350> a<00:02:09.380> link<00:02:09.679> another<00:02:10.369> guy<00:02:10.550> who<00:02:11.090> it's

by a green a link another guy who it's

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:15.250 
by a green a link another guy who it's
basically<00:02:12.290> similar<00:02:12.680> to<00:02:13.370> the<00:02:13.850> way<00:02:14.260> Necroscope

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:15.260 
basically similar to the way Necroscope

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:17.800 
basically similar to the way Necroscope
made<00:02:15.530> his<00:02:15.739> videos<00:02:16.130> except<00:02:16.880> you<00:02:17.180> have<00:02:17.390> the<00:02:17.570> two

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:17.810 
made his videos except you have the two

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:20.500 
made his videos except you have the two
screens<00:02:18.170> on<00:02:18.380> the<00:02:18.500> right<00:02:18.709> there<00:02:19.040> I<00:02:19.510> duplicate

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:20.510 
screens on the right there I duplicate

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:22.720 
screens on the right there I duplicate
the<00:02:21.050> bottom<00:02:21.650> screen<00:02:22.010> they're<00:02:22.220> the<00:02:22.400> exact<00:02:22.700> same

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:22.730 
the bottom screen they're the exact same

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:25.660 
the bottom screen they're the exact same
time<00:02:23.300> there<00:02:23.690> so<00:02:24.140> that<00:02:24.170> way<00:02:24.500> you<00:02:25.100> can<00:02:25.250> see<00:02:25.459> like

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:25.670 
time there so that way you can see like

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:27.100 
time there so that way you can see like
if<00:02:25.700> there's<00:02:25.970> a<00:02:26.030> cutscene<00:02:26.480> you<00:02:26.720> can<00:02:26.870> look<00:02:26.959> on

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:27.110 
if there's a cutscene you can look on

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:28.930 
if there's a cutscene you can look on
the<00:02:27.230> right<00:02:27.350> side<00:02:27.680> to<00:02:27.860> see<00:02:28.010> oh<00:02:28.250> so<00:02:28.670> that's<00:02:28.790> how

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:28.940 
the right side to see oh so that's how

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:31.180 
the right side to see oh so that's how
the<00:02:29.060> two<00:02:29.360> screens<00:02:30.110> work<00:02:30.380> together<00:02:30.560> like<00:02:30.920> that

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:31.190 
the two screens work together like that

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:33.640 
the two screens work together like that
or<00:02:31.579> if<00:02:32.150> you<00:02:32.299> just<00:02:32.329> want<00:02:32.690> to<00:02:32.780> see<00:02:32.930> you<00:02:33.410> know<00:02:33.500> the

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:33.650 
or if you just want to see you know the

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:35.860 
or if you just want to see you know the
main<00:02:33.739> action<00:02:34.310> you<00:02:34.670> can<00:02:34.820> just<00:02:35.030> look<00:02:35.180> at<00:02:35.450> the<00:02:35.690> big

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:35.870 
main action you can just look at the big

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:39.819 
main action you can just look at the big
screen<00:02:36.170> there<00:02:36.440> and<00:02:36.890> it<00:02:37.549> shows<00:02:38.650> you<00:02:39.650> know<00:02:39.769> you

00:02:39.819 --> 00:02:39.829 
screen there and it shows you know you

00:02:39.829 --> 00:02:42.069 
screen there and it shows you know you
can<00:02:40.070> see<00:02:40.250> everything<00:02:40.700> all<00:02:40.880> at<00:02:40.940> once<00:02:41.720> they're

00:02:42.069 --> 00:02:42.079 
can see everything all at once they're

00:02:42.079 --> 00:02:44.289 
can see everything all at once they're
like<00:02:42.290> that<00:02:42.560> the<00:02:42.980> only<00:02:43.220> drawback<00:02:43.400> that<00:02:43.760> I<00:02:43.970> see

00:02:44.289 --> 00:02:44.299 
like that the only drawback that I see

00:02:44.299 --> 00:02:46.960 
like that the only drawback that I see
to<00:02:44.420> this<00:02:44.540> method<00:02:44.959> is<00:02:45.200> that<00:02:45.230> like<00:02:46.100> right<00:02:46.310> now<00:02:46.549> as

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:46.970

00:02:48.699 --> 00:02:48.709 
you can see it kind of looks a little

00:02:48.709 --> 00:02:50.890 
you can see it kind of looks a little
weird<00:02:48.950> seeing<00:02:49.280> the<00:02:49.459> same<00:02:49.610> screen<00:02:50.030> twice<00:02:50.510> in

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:24.440 
his way to do this to stretch the video

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:26.590 
his way to do this to stretch the video
the<00:03:24.680> raw<00:03:24.859> video<00:03:25.340> a<00:03:25.430> little<00:03:25.820> bit<00:03:25.970> to<00:03:26.390> make<00:03:26.540> it

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:26.600 
the raw video a little bit to make it

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:28.240 
the raw video a little bit to make it
take<00:03:26.870> out<00:03:26.989> more<00:03:27.230> of<00:03:27.260> the<00:03:27.410> screen<00:03:27.739> and<00:03:27.769> it

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:28.250 
take out more of the screen and it

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:29.979 
take out more of the screen and it
actually<00:03:28.400> looked<00:03:28.760> all<00:03:28.940> right<00:03:29.120> to<00:03:29.180> me<00:03:29.480> but<00:03:29.720> a

00:03:29.979 --> 00:03:29.989 
actually looked all right to me but a

00:03:29.989 --> 00:03:31.990 
actually looked all right to me but a
lot<00:03:30.769> of<00:03:30.799> people<00:03:30.980> didn't<00:03:31.310> want<00:03:31.489> other<00:03:31.790> people

00:03:31.990 --> 00:03:32.000 
lot of people didn't want other people

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.750 
lot of people didn't want other people
didn't<00:03:32.690> really<00:03:32.720> care<00:03:33.050> for<00:03:33.110> it<00:03:33.349> so<00:03:33.620> a<00:03:34.099> lot<00:03:34.730> of

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:34.760 
didn't really care for it so a lot of
