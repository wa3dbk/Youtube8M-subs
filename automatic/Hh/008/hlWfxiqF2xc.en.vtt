my go-to Android phone right now and he

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:51.649 
my go-to Android phone right now and he
is<00:01:48.390> just<00:01:48.930> so<00:01:48.990> Swift<00:01:49.619> and<00:01:50.180> you<00:01:51.180> can<00:01:51.329> see<00:01:51.479> that

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:51.659 
is just so Swift and you can see that

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:53.870 
is just so Swift and you can see that
I'm<00:01:51.869> just<00:01:51.899> going<00:01:52.350> through<00:01:52.770> each<00:01:53.070> part<00:01:53.610> of<00:01:53.700> the

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:53.880 
I'm just going through each part of the

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:56.270 
I'm just going through each part of the
emotion<00:01:54.479> UI<00:01:54.659> which<00:01:55.049> is<00:01:55.380> what<00:01:55.649> Hawaii<00:01:55.979> and

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:56.280 
emotion UI which is what Hawaii and

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:59.450 
emotion UI which is what Hawaii and
honor<00:01:56.579> phones<00:01:56.969> use<00:01:57.530> which<00:01:58.530> is<00:01:58.860> quite<00:01:59.219> great

00:01:59.450 --> 00:01:59.460 
honor phones use which is quite great

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:03.380 
honor phones use which is quite great
and<00:01:59.719> one<00:02:00.719> thing<00:02:01.020> that<00:02:01.049> the<00:02:01.790> emotion<00:02:02.790> UI<00:02:02.969> lacks

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:03.390 
and one thing that the emotion UI lacks

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:06.080 
and one thing that the emotion UI lacks
is<00:02:03.780> an<00:02:04.020> app<00:02:04.200> drawer<00:02:04.469> I<00:02:04.710> don't<00:02:04.950> know<00:02:05.040> why<00:02:05.250> Hawaii

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:06.090 
is an app drawer I don't know why Hawaii

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:09.050 
is an app drawer I don't know why Hawaii
and<00:02:06.360> honor<00:02:06.659> decided<00:02:07.259> to<00:02:07.409> do<00:02:07.560> this<00:02:07.799> but<00:02:08.520> it's

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:09.060 
and honor decided to do this but it's

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:11.210 
and honor decided to do this but it's
similar<00:02:09.330> to<00:02:09.479> the<00:02:09.629> iPhone<00:02:09.780> because<00:02:10.500> I<00:02:10.530> really

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:11.220 
similar to the iPhone because I really

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:55.190 
going to be able to see a sample shot
and<00:03:53.550> it<00:03:53.940> just<00:03:54.209> came<00:03:54.390> up<00:03:54.540> quite<00:03:54.660> nice<00:03:54.840> this<00:03:55.020> is

00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:55.200 
and it just came up quite nice this is

00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:57.740 
and it just came up quite nice this is
the<00:03:55.380> back<00:03:55.650> camera<00:03:55.950> and<00:03:56.370> there<00:03:57.300> is<00:03:57.390> also<00:03:57.600> going

00:03:57.740 --> 00:03:57.750 
the back camera and there is also going

00:03:57.750 --> 00:03:59.600 
the back camera and there is also going
to<00:03:57.870> be<00:03:57.930> a<00:03:57.959> front<00:03:58.170> camera<00:03:58.380> one<00:03:58.680> right<00:03:58.920> here<00:03:59.280> and

00:03:59.600 --> 00:03:59.610 
to be a front camera one right here and

00:03:59.610 --> 00:04:01.880 
to be a front camera one right here and
like<00:04:00.360> I<00:04:00.390> said<00:04:00.630> this<00:04:00.810> was<00:04:01.050> with<00:04:01.320> lighting

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:01.890 
like I said this was with lighting

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:04.280 
like I said this was with lighting
however<00:04:02.310> so<00:04:03.090> that's<00:04:03.510> probably<00:04:03.750> why<00:04:04.110> I<00:04:04.140> look

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:04.290 
however so that's probably why I look

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:07.440 
however so that's probably why I look
better<00:04:04.530> but<00:04:05.160> it<00:04:05.310> still<00:04:05.670> looks<00:04:05.790> quite<00:04:06.090> good

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:07.450 
better but it still looks quite good

00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:09.870 
better but it still looks quite good
the<00:04:08.170> front<00:04:08.740> camera<00:04:08.860> as<00:04:09.099> I<00:04:09.130> said<00:04:09.430> was<00:04:09.640> 5

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:09.880 
the front camera as I said was 5

00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:12.150 
the front camera as I said was 5
megapixel<00:04:10.390> and<00:04:10.510> I<00:04:10.660> believe<00:04:11.110> it<00:04:11.380> does<00:04:11.770> have<00:04:12.040> an

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:12.160 
megapixel and I believe it does have an

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:15.839 
megapixel and I believe it does have an
aperture<00:04:12.400> of<00:04:13.080> 2.2<00:04:14.099> although<00:04:15.099> I<00:04:15.340> might<00:04:15.550> not<00:04:15.700> be

00:04:15.839 --> 00:04:15.849 
aperture of 2.2 although I might not be

00:04:15.849 --> 00:04:17.400 
aperture of 2.2 although I might not be
correct<00:04:16.060> on<00:04:16.329> that<00:04:16.389> one<00:04:16.600> so<00:04:16.959> you'd<00:04:17.109> need<00:04:17.260> to

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:17.410 
correct on that one so you'd need to

00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:21.080 
correct on that one so you'd need to
check<00:04:17.620> that<00:04:17.650> and<00:04:18.780> screen<00:04:19.780> actually<00:04:20.200> has<00:04:20.470> 5

check that and screen actually has 5

00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:24.150 
check that and screen actually has 5
inches<00:04:22.090> and<00:04:22.560> here<00:04:23.560> you'll<00:04:23.710> be<00:04:23.860> able<00:04:23.919> to<00:04:24.040> see<00:04:24.130> a
