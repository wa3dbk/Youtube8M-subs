 also with a table with food and this and 

00:05:44.310 --> 00:05:51.990
 this table although you have as a base the 

00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:55.230
 food so you also have one to the 

00:05:51.990 --> 00:05:59.129
 table so we can can be put if you do not 

00:05:55.230 --> 00:06:03.719

00:05:59.129 --> 00:06:06.539
 comes with some finite stairs and here 

00:06:03.719 --> 00:06:09.629
 I put him in the back and that's how 

00:06:06.539 --> 00:06:12.389
 put the doll in here the mind is 

00:06:09.629 --> 00:06:15.809
 up here here see the bed appears 

00:06:12.389 --> 00:06:19.789
 then you must leave the bed and then there is 

00:06:15.809 --> 00:06:19.789
 space for you to put your doll 

00:06:24.620 --> 00:06:30.790
 we have a mask and there it is 

00:06:30.830 --> 00:06:41.150
 and they have also given him 

00:06:36.860 --> 00:06:44.449
 and the bed is fine like that and then you can stop 

00:06:41.150 --> 00:06:47.060
 this so that it stops carlos up 

00:06:44.449 --> 00:06:49.669
 this way or you can do it for 

00:06:47.060 --> 00:06:52.629

00:06:49.669 --> 00:06:52.629
 here open it 

00:06:53.419 --> 00:07:00.830

00:06:56.580 --> 00:07:00.830
 accessories when you finish playing 

00:07:05.900 --> 00:07:10.539
