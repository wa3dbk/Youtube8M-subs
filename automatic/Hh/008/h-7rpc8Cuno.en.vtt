00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:53.040 
which is super rare because it's

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:55.670 
which is super rare because it's
actually<00:01:53.369> hard<00:01:53.610> to<00:01:53.670> do<00:01:53.880> to<00:01:54.090> limit<00:01:54.659> where<00:01:55.350> bees

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:55.680 
actually hard to do to limit where bees

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:58.609 
actually hard to do to limit where bees
will<00:01:56.040> fly<00:01:56.340> to<00:01:56.850> get<00:01:57.030> access<00:01:57.570> to<00:01:57.719> pollens<00:01:58.350> so

00:01:58.609 --> 00:01:58.619 
will fly to get access to pollens so

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:01.490 
will fly to get access to pollens so
what<00:01:59.280> tropical<00:01:59.820> traditions<00:02:00.270> is<00:02:00.420> done<00:02:00.659> is<00:02:01.140> they

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:01.500 
what tropical traditions is done is they

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:03.319 
what tropical traditions is done is they
set<00:02:01.770> up<00:02:01.860> their<00:02:02.009> beehives<00:02:02.399> and<00:02:02.640> the<00:02:02.790> super

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:03.329 
set up their beehives and the super

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:05.420 
set up their beehives and the super
remote<00:02:03.570> locations<00:02:04.290> in

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:05.430 
remote locations in

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:08.210 
remote locations in
and<00:02:05.880> they<00:02:06.060> only<00:02:06.270> have<00:02:06.480> access<00:02:06.690> to<00:02:07.220> wildflowers

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:08.220 
and they only have access to wildflowers

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:10.400 
and they only have access to wildflowers
and<00:02:08.460> so<00:02:08.610> there's<00:02:08.789> no<00:02:09.110> pesticides<00:02:10.110> or

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:10.410 
and so there's no pesticides or

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:12.380 
and so there's no pesticides or
chemicals<00:02:10.440> anywhere<00:02:11.070> so<00:02:11.340> that<00:02:11.580> means<00:02:12.120> you<00:02:12.300> get

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:12.390 
chemicals anywhere so that means you get

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:14.570 
chemicals anywhere so that means you get
a<00:02:12.450> much<00:02:12.660> healthier<00:02:13.280> product<00:02:14.280> you<00:02:14.370> don't<00:02:14.430> have

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:14.580 
a much healthier product you don't have

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:16.040 
a much healthier product you don't have
to<00:02:14.670> worry<00:02:14.820> about<00:02:14.940> putting<00:02:15.180> any<00:02:15.360> chemicals<00:02:15.900> in
