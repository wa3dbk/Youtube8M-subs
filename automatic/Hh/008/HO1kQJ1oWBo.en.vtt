00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:08.260
 wright in stop motion of god yours in 

00:00:04.240 --> 00:00:11.450
 those who kiss gear the incredible me 

00:00:08.260 --> 00:00:14.930
 I am unable, I can not 

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:18.670
 I can one day do things like that 

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:22.130
 well my answer undoubtedly yes yes 

00:00:18.670 --> 00:00:26.620
 I also have to say that not everything 

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:30.370
 that glitters is gold I also take my 

00:00:26.620 --> 00:00:33.120
 make cases like your father like all son 

00:00:30.370 --> 00:00:33.120
 of good father 

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:39.829
 what happens that 

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:42.050
 put bazucazos because it can not be 

00:00:39.829 --> 00:00:44.030
 didactic then the didactic but 

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:46.340
 there are probably many people not what 

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:48.800
 I would understand and it's always better to put 

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:52.010
 didactic examples things that people 

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:54.740
 will see what can be done 

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:58.780
 but good 

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:58.780
 bazucazos like all son of neighbor 

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:04.390
 what I want to discuss with this is 

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:04.390
 that I was also there 

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:10.100
 and if you are an ordinary person like me 

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:14.030
 is flesh and blood has its 

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:15.830
 limitations and in addition the program to be 

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:19.100
 installed from house with which we are born 

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:21.790
 all that is the let's say the genetic the 

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:21.790
 what does it say 

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:26.610
 I prefer to avoid the failure to pursue 

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:29.100
 the success 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:30.240
 because well evolutionarily 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:33.150
 talking 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:38.760
 we come from our predecessors our 

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:41.640
 ancestors of 150,000 years ago where it was 

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:43.770
 more important to survive than to have 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:45.950
 business success or success with 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:47.580
 women success itself was to survive 

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:49.740
 but things have changed a lot 

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:52.110
 is more to a society in which the 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:56.190
 survival today is 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:59.890
 practically a standard is living 

00:01:56.190 --> 00:02:01.659
 on the street begging you will not die 

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:03.110
 and you're not going to get to that point 

00:02:01.659 --> 00:02:06.740
 supposed 

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:08.830
 and yet everything that is now a 

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:11.270
 danger everything carries a risk 

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:14.300
 our subconscious analyzes it from 

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:17.690
 the point of view of the 

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:20.980
 of the possible loss of life when 

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:24.070
 this is what we can lose is the ego 

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:26.060
 we can feel hurt we can 

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:27.440
 frustrate us in some way but 

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:29.170
 our doubt will be intact 

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:32.720
 show no danger 

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:34.270
 then it's just about trying to be 

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:38.020
 a little bit 

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:41.050
 of a little bit smart to try 

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:45.310
 synthesize all these concepts about 

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:50.020
 everything to accept one as is and know that 

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:53.840
 it's where we are worth, let's not compare 

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:57.620
 with nobody but ourselves 

00:02:53.840 --> 00:03:00.019
 where are you from and where do you want to go and 

00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:03.800
 sitt in regards to this in people that you 

00:03:00.019 --> 00:03:06.940
 motivate people to help you surround yourself with 

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:09.440
 people that you get ahead but 

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:13.220
 given time 

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:16.040
 instead of frustrating or crushing you 

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:18.230
 with all the things you do wrong rewards 

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:19.940
 why do you do well because the 

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:22.820
 balance but it is difficult and at the beginning 

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:25.520
 this is how things are doing I see the 

00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:27.940
 exhibition and we only focus on 

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:29.740
 this when 

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:31.270
 we have to start making this 

00:03:29.740 --> 00:03:32.440
 grow to focus on the things we do 

00:03:31.270 --> 00:03:35.100
 well we do well that we do well 

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:38.430
 what do we do well for what 

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:40.880
 in the end it has gone badly to improve 

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:43.350
 I do this badly because I'm going to improve it 

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:47.550
 but we keep everything we do 

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:49.170
 bad because it can be endless and we 

00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:53.100
 let's frustrate let's throw in the towel 

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:56.030
 before starting and no one nobody 

00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:59.150
 you have reached somewhere 

00:03:56.030 --> 00:04:01.490
 he has done it in that way criticizing and 

00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:04.730
 noticing everything that was wrong with the 

00:04:01.490 --> 00:04:08.240
 backwards what he has done is that of what 

00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:10.220
 makes shine that gives you that 

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:13.430
 difference finding that added value 

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:15.890
 that only you have and try to polish it and 

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:19.010
 polish it from town and improve it until 

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:21.320
 that is carbon becomes a diamond 

00:04:19.010 --> 00:04:24.700
 that is not magic that is not today's 

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:28.890
 tomorrow that is a work of a life 

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:28.890
 but that 's the job
