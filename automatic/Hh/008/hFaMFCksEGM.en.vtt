all right so it looks like we got a
couple<00:00:14.950> more<00:00:15.160> hands<00:00:15.400> below<00:00:15.990> this<00:00:16.990> video

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:17.200 
couple more hands below this video

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:20.279 
couple more hands below this video
what's<00:00:17.980> hello<00:00:18.340> Soni<00:00:18.939> Ani<00:00:18.970> is<00:00:19.240> appears<00:00:20.110> to<00:00:20.199> be

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:20.289 
what's hello Soni Ani is appears to be

00:00:20.289 --> 00:00:21.359 
what's hello Soni Ani is appears to be
the<00:00:20.380> person<00:00:20.529> who<00:00:20.680> actually<00:00:20.860> sent<00:00:21.279> the

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:21.369 
the person who actually sent the

00:00:21.369 --> 00:00:26.580 
the person who actually sent the
handsome<00:00:21.810> no<00:00:22.810> cool<00:00:23.080> I<00:00:25.020> mean<00:00:26.020> this<00:00:26.140> is<00:00:26.200> just<00:00:26.349> a

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:26.590 
handsome no cool I mean this is just a

00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:28.160 
handsome no cool I mean this is just a
standard<00:00:26.829> bed<00:00:27.160> with<00:00:27.369> just<00:00:27.579> about<00:00:27.700> anything

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:28.170 
standard bed with just about anything

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:31.650 
standard bed with just about anything
absolutely<00:00:29.170> and<00:00:29.619> when<00:00:30.250> he<00:00:30.340> calls<00:00:30.580> I<00:00:31.000> guess<00:00:31.480> you

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:31.660 
absolutely and when he calls I guess you

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:34.710 
absolutely and when he calls I guess you
expect<00:00:32.110> a<00:00:33.040> sex<00:00:33.699> I<00:00:34.059> mean<00:00:34.180> you<00:00:34.269> have<00:00:34.449> to<00:00:34.570> put

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:34.720 
expect a sex I mean you have to put

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:37.140 
expect a sex I mean you have to put
slightly<00:00:35.019> less<00:00:35.140> weight<00:00:35.350> on<00:00:35.500> a<00:00:35.620> sex<00:00:35.920> I<00:00:36.190> think

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:37.150 
slightly less weight on a sex I think

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:38.280 
slightly less weight on a sex I think
this<00:00:37.269> is<00:00:37.330> actually<00:00:37.750> one<00:00:37.900> of<00:00:37.930> the<00:00:38.050> scenarios

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:38.290 
this is actually one of the scenarios

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:39.840 
this is actually one of the scenarios
where<00:00:38.769> it's<00:00:38.860> just<00:00:39.010> very<00:00:39.160> good<00:00:39.430> to<00:00:39.519> triple

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:39.850 
where it's just very good to triple

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:41.490 
where it's just very good to triple
barrel<00:00:40.030> at<00:00:40.180> the<00:00:40.269> very<00:00:40.480> wide<00:00:40.750> range<00:00:40.780> oh<00:00:41.230> I'm

00:00:41.490 --> 00:00:41.500 
barrel at the very wide range oh I'm

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:44.460 
barrel at the very wide range oh I'm
because<00:00:41.860> there's<00:00:42.100> a<00:00:42.160> lot<00:00:42.370> of<00:00:42.400> factors<00:00:43.470> for

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:44.470 
because there's a lot of factors for

00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:45.959 
because there's a lot of factors for
triple<00:00:44.829> barreling<00:00:45.190> that<00:00:45.370> are<00:00:45.460> not<00:00:45.700> that

00:00:45.959 --> 00:00:45.969 
triple barreling that are not that

00:00:45.969 --> 00:00:50.040 
triple barreling that are not that
obvious<00:00:46.120> for<00:00:46.510> example<00:00:48.149> well<00:00:49.149> maybe<00:00:49.329> it<00:00:49.539> is<00:00:49.629> do

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:50.050 
obvious for example well maybe it is do

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:51.389 
obvious for example well maybe it is do
you<00:00:50.140> think<00:00:50.320> it's<00:00:50.440> obvious<00:00:50.590> to<00:00:50.829> key<00:00:51.039> you<00:00:51.160> right

00:00:51.389 --> 00:00:51.399 
you think it's obvious to key you right

00:00:51.399 --> 00:00:53.040 
you think it's obvious to key you right
now<00:00:51.550> with<00:00:51.730> that<00:00:51.910> he<00:00:52.390> doesn't<00:00:52.600> have<00:00:52.780> a<00:00:52.870> lot<00:00:53.020> of

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:53.050 
now with that he doesn't have a lot of

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:56.939 
now with that he doesn't have a lot of
aces<00:00:53.289> in<00:00:53.469> this<00:00:53.649> range<00:00:53.920> I<00:00:55.079> be<00:00:56.079> clear<00:00:56.320> it<00:00:56.680> should

00:00:56.939 --> 00:00:56.949 
aces in this range I be clear it should

00:00:56.949 --> 00:00:59.970 
aces in this range I be clear it should
be<00:00:56.980> clear<00:00:57.250> so<00:00:57.609> in<00:00:57.789> that<00:00:57.969> case<00:00:58.239> I<00:00:58.510> guess<00:00:58.980> but

00:00:59.970 --> 00:00:59.980 
be clear so in that case I guess but

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:02.729 
be clear so in that case I guess but
symptom<00:01:00.640> so<00:01:00.879> again<00:01:01.390> one<00:01:01.809> thing<00:01:02.050> is<00:01:02.230> there's

00:01:02.729 --> 00:01:02.739 
symptom so again one thing is there's

00:01:02.739 --> 00:01:05.040 
symptom so again one thing is there's
not<00:01:02.890> a<00:01:02.949> lot<00:01:03.129> of<00:01:03.160> good<00:01:03.280> equity<00:01:03.760> yani<00:01:04.690> can<00:01:04.899> have

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:05.050 
not a lot of good equity yani can have

00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:07.139 
not a lot of good equity yani can have
here<00:01:05.229> so<00:01:05.500> that<00:01:05.740> makes<00:01:05.979> it<00:01:06.100> very<00:01:06.160> unlikely<00:01:06.670> that

00:01:07.139 --> 00:01:07.149 
here so that makes it very unlikely that

00:01:07.149 --> 00:01:08.520 
here so that makes it very unlikely that
he<00:01:07.300> would<00:01:07.420> dub<00:01:07.660> that<00:01:07.960> makes<00:01:08.140> it<00:01:08.259> less<00:01:08.500> likely

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:08.530 
he would dub that makes it less likely

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:10.380 
he would dub that makes it less likely
that<00:01:08.920> he<00:01:09.190> would<00:01:09.310> double<00:01:09.640> barrel<00:01:09.910> light<00:01:10.090> or

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:10.390 
that he would double barrel light or

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:12.120 
that he would double barrel light or
that<00:01:10.539> would<00:01:10.630> be<00:01:10.720> a<00:01:10.750> factor<00:01:11.110> to<00:01:11.320> make<00:01:11.710> you<00:01:11.860> want

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:12.130 
that would be a factor to make you want

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:13.980 
that would be a factor to make you want
to<00:01:12.220> fall<00:01:12.399> tightly<00:01:12.789> on<00:01:12.910> the<00:01:13.030> turn<00:01:13.240> I<00:01:13.509> think<00:01:13.840> I

00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:13.990 
to fall tightly on the turn I think I

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:15.540 
to fall tightly on the turn I think I
think<00:01:14.170> it<00:01:14.259> unnecessarily<00:01:14.950> many<00:01:15.250> people

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:15.550 
think it unnecessarily many people

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:17.999 
think it unnecessarily many people
signed<00:01:15.820> up<00:01:15.940> way<00:01:16.119> to<00:01:16.179> my<00:01:16.450> share<00:01:16.630> if<00:01:17.080> I<00:01:17.590> think<00:01:17.890> the

00:01:17.999 --> 00:01:18.009 
signed up way to my share if I think the

00:01:18.009 --> 00:01:20.190 
signed up way to my share if I think the
less<00:01:18.220> history<00:01:18.729> on<00:01:18.970> e<00:01:19.000> has<00:01:19.210> with<00:01:19.360> you<00:01:19.600> the<00:01:19.960> more

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:20.200 
less history on e has with you the more

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:22.830 
less history on e has with you the more
I<00:01:20.560> be<00:01:21.220> in<00:01:21.340> favor<00:01:21.549> of<00:01:21.670> triple<00:01:22.060> barrel<00:01:22.240> is<00:01:22.390> bored

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:22.840 
I be in favor of triple barrel is bored

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:25.679 
I be in favor of triple barrel is bored
because<00:01:23.369> the<00:01:24.369> more<00:01:24.610> q<00:01:24.909> thinks<00:01:25.390> this<00:01:25.630> is

00:01:25.679 --> 00:01:25.689 
because the more q thinks this is

00:01:25.689 --> 00:01:28.469 
because the more q thinks this is
obvious<00:01:26.259> the<00:01:26.770> more<00:01:27.159> he's<00:01:27.369> gonna<00:01:27.549> be<00:01:28.180> inclined

00:01:28.469 --> 00:01:28.479 
obvious the more he's gonna be inclined

00:01:28.479 --> 00:01:30.060 
obvious the more he's gonna be inclined
at<00:01:28.600> all<00:01:28.720> yeah<00:01:29.020> I<00:01:29.049> like<00:01:29.380> dope<00:01:29.560> I<00:01:29.710> think<00:01:29.950> it's

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:30.070 
at all yeah I like dope I think it's

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:32.580 
at all yeah I like dope I think it's
some<00:01:30.250> becomes<00:01:30.640> much<00:01:30.909> better<00:01:31.180> if<00:01:31.540> like<00:01:32.200> it's

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:32.590 
some becomes much better if like it's

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:34.230 
some becomes much better if like it's
even<00:01:33.009> better<00:01:33.130> i<00:01:33.250> guess<00:01:33.369> the<00:01:33.520> ideal<00:01:34.030> situation

00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:34.240 
even better i guess the ideal situation

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:36.870 
even better i guess the ideal situation
as<00:01:34.600> if<00:01:34.750> the<00:01:34.869> three<00:01:35.200> is<00:01:35.530> card<00:01:36.250> hits<00:01:36.610> more

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:36.880 
as if the three is card hits more

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:38.100 
as if the three is card hits more
because<00:01:37.210> they're<00:01:37.329> wanting<00:01:37.570> range<00:01:37.750> search<00:01:37.990> of

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:38.110 
because they're wanting range search of

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:42.420 
because they're wanting range search of
czech<00:01:38.320> hall<00:01:38.470> with<00:01:38.710> more<00:01:39.030> like<00:01:40.030> Ace<00:01:40.960> King<00:01:41.829> 7<00:01:42.280> is

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:42.430 
czech hall with more like Ace King 7 is

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:43.469 
czech hall with more like Ace King 7 is
there<00:01:42.549> a<00:01:42.579> better<00:01:42.759> because<00:01:43.090> then<00:01:43.149> all<00:01:43.210> the

00:01:43.469 --> 00:01:43.479 
there a better because then all the

00:01:43.479 --> 00:01:45.240 
there a better because then all the
seven<00:01:43.720> acts<00:01:43.960> I<00:01:44.140> get<00:01:44.290> 7x<00:01:44.590> really<00:01:44.890> calm<00:01:45.070> three

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:45.250 
seven acts I get 7x really calm three

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:48.600 
seven acts I get 7x really calm three
streets<00:01:45.520> hear<00:01:45.990> them<00:01:46.990> so<00:01:47.409> if<00:01:47.530> I<00:01:47.649> if<00:01:47.890> I<00:01:48.040> dare<00:01:48.310> that

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:48.610 
streets hear them so if I if I dare that

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:50.819 
streets hear them so if I if I dare that
being<00:01:48.820> said<00:01:48.939> if<00:01:49.119> I<00:01:49.270> well<00:01:49.899> he<00:01:50.020> bets<00:01:50.229> let's<00:01:50.710> say

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:55.980 
THX that being said if I had like five
four<00:01:54.700> here<00:01:54.880> I'd<00:01:55.030> definitely<00:01:55.390> about<00:01:55.719> the<00:01:55.840> turn

00:01:55.980 --> 00:01:55.990 
four here I'd definitely about the turn

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:59.010 
four here I'd definitely about the turn
by<00:01:56.530> 24<00:01:56.979> it<00:01:57.100> does<00:01:57.250> the<00:01:57.340> turn<00:01:57.520> but<00:01:58.210> even<00:01:58.719> if<00:01:58.810> I<00:01:58.899> had

00:01:59.010 --> 00:01:59.020 
by 24 it does the turn but even if I had

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:00.389 
by 24 it does the turn but even if I had
like<00:01:59.140> six<00:01:59.439> seven<00:01:59.740> I<00:01:59.799> made<00:01:59.979> at<00:02:00.100> the<00:02:00.219> turn

00:02:00.389 --> 00:02:00.399 
like six seven I made at the turn

00:02:00.399 --> 00:02:02.910 
like six seven I made at the turn
because<00:02:00.640> you<00:02:00.759> I<00:02:01.090> think<00:02:01.390> this<00:02:01.930> is<00:02:02.170> most<00:02:02.530> well<00:02:02.799> I

00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:02.920 
because you I think this is most well I

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:04.830 
because you I think this is most well I
think<00:02:02.979> probably<00:02:03.520> his<00:02:03.820> most<00:02:04.000> likely<00:02:04.420> hand<00:02:04.659> is

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:04.840 
think probably his most likely hand is

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:09.240 
think probably his most likely hand is
like<00:02:06.180> okay<00:02:07.180> sure<00:02:07.600> Queen<00:02:08.229> jack<00:02:08.440> is<00:02:08.649> probably<00:02:09.039> is

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:09.250 
like okay sure Queen jack is probably is

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:12.840 
like okay sure Queen jack is probably is
most<00:02:09.489> likely<00:02:09.729> had<00:02:10.410> you<00:02:11.410> have<00:02:11.590> to<00:02:11.829> always<00:02:12.190> take

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:12.850 
most likely had you have to always take

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:14.130 
most likely had you have to always take
consideration<00:02:13.360> that<00:02:13.720> there's<00:02:13.900> going<00:02:13.989> to<00:02:14.079> be

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:14.140 
consideration that there's going to be

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:15.930 
consideration that there's going to be
more<00:02:14.380> combos<00:02:14.739> of<00:02:14.890> error<00:02:15.100> than<00:02:15.340> say<00:02:15.519> like<00:02:15.730> trip

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:15.940 
more combos of error than say like trip

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:16.720 
more combos of error than say like trip
gains<00:02:16.180> there

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:16.730 
gains there

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:18.850 
gains there
maybe<00:02:17.450> maybe<00:02:17.810> I<00:02:18.290> mean<00:02:18.560> there's<00:02:18.800> more

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:18.860 
maybe maybe I mean there's more

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:20.559 
maybe maybe I mean there's more
conference<00:02:19.370> of<00:02:19.459> Queen<00:02:19.670> Jack<00:02:19.909> than<00:02:20.150> say<00:02:20.330> like

00:02:20.559 --> 00:02:20.569 
conference of Queen Jack than say like

00:02:20.569 --> 00:02:23.289 
conference of Queen Jack than say like
King<00:02:21.260> 10<00:02:21.470> yeah<00:02:21.980> I<00:02:22.159> think<00:02:22.310> everyone<00:02:22.909> would<00:02:23.060> say

00:02:23.289 --> 00:02:23.299 
King 10 yeah I think everyone would say

00:02:23.299 --> 00:02:25.360 
King 10 yeah I think everyone would say
that<00:02:23.720> this<00:02:23.870> is<00:02:24.080> a<00:02:24.110> bad<00:02:24.500> barrel<00:02:24.950> current<00:02:25.250> though

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:25.370 
that this is a bad barrel current though

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:28.110 
that this is a bad barrel current though
right<00:02:25.610> like<00:02:25.849> I<00:02:26.120> think<00:02:26.720> it's<00:02:26.989> a<00:02:27.140> deceptively

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:28.120 
right like I think it's a deceptively

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:30.699 
right like I think it's a deceptively
decent<00:02:29.120> bear<00:02:29.330> okay<00:02:29.629> but<00:02:29.959> see<00:02:30.260> that<00:02:30.440> that's

00:02:30.699 --> 00:02:30.709 
decent bear okay but see that that's

00:02:30.709 --> 00:02:32.619 
decent bear okay but see that that's
almost<00:02:31.040> that's<00:02:31.340> almost<00:02:31.610> reasoning<00:02:32.090> to<00:02:32.299> barrel

00:02:32.619 --> 00:02:32.629 
almost that's almost reasoning to barrel

00:02:32.629 --> 00:02:35.680 
almost that's almost reasoning to barrel
because<00:02:32.780> there<00:02:33.620> is<00:02:33.830> some<00:02:34.250> reasons<00:02:35.060> to<00:02:35.360> barrel

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:35.690 
because there is some reasons to barrel

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:37.750 
because there is some reasons to barrel
like<00:02:35.840> there<00:02:36.349> is<00:02:36.500> some<00:02:36.769> like<00:02:37.190> if<00:02:37.340> yes<00:02:37.549> Queen

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:37.760 
like there is some like if yes Queen

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:39.460 
like there is some like if yes Queen
xsarahx<00:02:38.150> I<00:02:38.209> would<00:02:38.480> expect<00:02:38.780> if<00:02:39.049> all<00:02:39.170> the<00:02:39.319> turn

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:39.470 
xsarahx I would expect if all the turn

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:41.350 
xsarahx I would expect if all the turn
like<00:02:39.650> every<00:02:39.890> time<00:02:40.010> do<00:02:40.190> ya<00:02:40.340> know<00:02:40.610> I'd<00:02:40.790> be<00:02:41.209> out<00:02:41.239> of

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:41.360 
like every time do ya know I'd be out of

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:44.500 
like every time do ya know I'd be out of
three<00:02:41.900> I<00:02:42.430> expect<00:02:43.430> to<00:02:43.459> unfold<00:02:43.760> a<00:02:43.879> lot<00:02:44.030> too<00:02:44.269> so

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:44.510 
three I expect to unfold a lot too so

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:47.229 
three I expect to unfold a lot too so
that<00:02:44.930> being<00:02:45.200> said<00:02:45.849> you're<00:02:46.849> just<00:02:46.879> basically

00:02:47.229 --> 00:02:47.239 
that being said you're just basically

00:02:47.239 --> 00:02:49.839 
that being said you're just basically
putting<00:02:47.750> them<00:02:47.959> on<00:02:48.110> a<00:02:48.140> king<00:02:48.530> or<00:02:49.040> those<00:02:49.400> hands

00:02:49.839 --> 00:02:49.849 
putting them on a king or those hands

00:02:49.849 --> 00:02:53.380 
putting them on a king or those hands
right<00:02:50.209> and<00:02:50.480> so<00:02:50.720> I<00:02:51.700> mean<00:02:52.700> if<00:02:52.730> you<00:02:52.849> bet<00:02:52.970> 80<00:02:53.120> on<00:02:53.299> the

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:53.390 
right and so I mean if you bet 80 on the

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:56.020 
right and so I mean if you bet 80 on the
turn<00:02:53.569> you<00:02:54.230> have<00:02:54.319> to<00:02:54.410> win<00:02:54.560> that's<00:02:55.190> 30<00:02:55.519> singles

00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:56.030 
turn you have to win that's 30 singles

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:57.970 
turn you have to win that's 30 singles
out<00:02:56.090> of<00:02:56.239> time<00:02:56.390> yeah<00:02:56.599> i<00:02:56.629> think<00:02:56.780> that<00:02:57.500> uh<00:02:57.620> my<00:02:57.769> god

00:02:57.970 --> 00:02:57.980 
out of time yeah i think that uh my god

00:02:57.980 --> 00:02:59.289 
out of time yeah i think that uh my god
the<00:02:58.129> middle<00:02:58.220> crowd<00:02:58.459> paired<00:02:58.760> like<00:02:59.000> I<00:02:59.090> can't

00:02:59.289 --> 00:02:59.299 
the middle crowd paired like I can't

00:02:59.299 --> 00:03:01.119 
the middle crowd paired like I can't
bluffin<00:02:59.569> so<00:02:59.690> that<00:02:59.840> that<00:03:00.079> being<00:03:00.319> said<00:03:00.500> when<00:03:00.769> Q

00:03:01.119 --> 00:03:01.129 
bluffin so that that being said when Q

00:03:01.129 --> 00:03:03.849 
bluffin so that that being said when Q
bets<00:03:01.430> like<00:03:02.000> I<00:03:02.299> think<00:03:02.750> this<00:03:02.870> is<00:03:02.930> good<00:03:03.170> play<00:03:03.410> if<00:03:03.620> q

00:03:03.849 --> 00:03:03.859 
bets like I think this is good play if q

00:03:03.859 --> 00:03:06.869 
bets like I think this is good play if q
Did<00:03:04.280> flood<00:03:04.670> the<00:03:04.760> flop<00:03:04.970> which<00:03:05.810> obviously<00:03:06.140> I

00:03:06.869 --> 00:03:06.879 
Did flood the flop which obviously I

00:03:06.879 --> 00:03:09.550 
Did flood the flop which obviously I
mean<00:03:07.879> some<00:03:08.420> people<00:03:08.720> some<00:03:08.989> people<00:03:09.049> do<00:03:09.410> this

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:09.560 
mean some people some people do this

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:11.500 
mean some people some people do this
like<00:03:09.769> I<00:03:09.950> mean<00:03:10.280> obviously<00:03:10.430> if<00:03:10.790> I<00:03:10.910> I<00:03:11.180> would

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:11.510 
like I mean obviously if I I would

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:13.089 
like I mean obviously if I I would
probably<00:03:11.690> rather<00:03:12.109> check<00:03:12.500> raise<00:03:12.769> on<00:03:12.980> this

00:03:13.089 --> 00:03:13.099 
probably rather check raise on this

00:03:13.099 --> 00:03:15.250 
probably rather check raise on this
board<00:03:13.370> with<00:03:13.519> total<00:03:13.879> air<00:03:14.000> if<00:03:14.359> I<00:03:14.569> had<00:03:14.780> to<00:03:14.959> wear

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:15.260 
board with total air if I had to wear

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:20.050 
board with total air if I had to wear
and<00:03:15.769> may<00:03:15.950> not<00:03:15.980> even<00:03:16.280> do<00:03:16.609> that<00:03:16.640> yeah<00:03:17.209> um<00:03:17.450> I<00:03:19.060> think

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:20.060 
and may not even do that yeah um I think

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:22.120 
and may not even do that yeah um I think
I<00:03:20.540> would<00:03:20.989> just<00:03:21.019> default<00:03:21.590> though<00:03:21.769> the<00:03:21.829> turn

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:22.130 
I would just default though the turn

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:25.780 
I would just default though the turn
with<00:03:22.370> with<00:03:22.910> most<00:03:23.540> every<00:03:23.930> hand<00:03:24.139> yeah<00:03:24.980> honestly

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:25.790 
with with most every hand yeah honestly

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:28.360 
with with most every hand yeah honestly
like<00:03:25.910> so<00:03:26.780> suspicious<00:03:27.470> do<00:03:27.859> you<00:03:27.950> think<00:03:28.220> this

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:28.370 
like so suspicious do you think this

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:32.289 
like so suspicious do you think this
looks<00:03:28.639> suspicious<00:03:29.650> yeah<00:03:30.650> which<00:03:31.549> is<00:03:31.579> just<00:03:31.910> so

00:03:32.289 --> 00:03:32.299 
looks suspicious yeah which is just so

00:03:32.299 --> 00:03:34.300 
looks suspicious yeah which is just so
that<00:03:32.900> one<00:03:33.139> thing<00:03:33.349> that<00:03:33.590> I<00:03:33.620> think<00:03:33.799> is<00:03:34.040> a<00:03:34.099> fag

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:34.310 
that one thing that I think is a fag

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:36.550 
that one thing that I think is a fag
reconsider<00:03:34.760> is<00:03:35.000> what's<00:03:35.959> the<00:03:36.079> key<00:03:36.290> who<00:03:36.380> does

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:36.560 
reconsider is what's the key who does

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:39.370 
reconsider is what's the key who does
have<00:03:36.680> a<00:03:36.739> king<00:03:37.040> okay<00:03:37.549> I<00:03:37.810> don't<00:03:38.810> think<00:03:38.900> there's<00:03:39.319> a

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:39.380 
have a king okay I don't think there's a

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:41.800 
have a king okay I don't think there's a
lot<00:03:39.590> of<00:03:39.650> reason<00:03:40.069> to<00:03:40.099> check<00:03:40.340> here<00:03:40.579> again<00:03:40.849> that's

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:41.810 
lot of reason to check here again that's

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:43.330 
lot of reason to check here again that's
because<00:03:42.230> I<00:03:42.590> think<00:03:42.889> most<00:03:43.040> people<00:03:43.310> would

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:43.340 
because I think most people would

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:46.030 
because I think most people would
autocheck<00:03:43.849> okay<00:03:44.180> but<00:03:44.900> I<00:03:44.930> think<00:03:45.349> there's<00:03:45.560> a<00:03:45.620> lot

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:46.040 
autocheck okay but I think there's a lot

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:48.220 
autocheck okay but I think there's a lot
of<00:03:46.069> reasoning<00:03:46.579> for<00:03:46.970> bedding<00:03:47.299> considering<00:03:47.930> one

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:48.230 
of reasoning for bedding considering one

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:52.270 
of reasoning for bedding considering one
like<00:03:48.639> Sonic<00:03:49.639> card<00:03:49.910> that<00:03:50.650> well<00:03:51.650> the<00:03:52.069> thing<00:03:52.250> is

00:03:52.270 --> 00:03:52.280 
like Sonic card that well the thing is

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:54.099 
like Sonic card that well the thing is
like<00:03:52.519> maybe<00:03:52.849> he's<00:03:53.090> just<00:03:53.209> like<00:03:53.419> okay<00:03:53.870> great

00:03:54.099 --> 00:03:54.109 
like maybe he's just like okay great

00:03:54.109 --> 00:03:57.789 
like maybe he's just like okay great
like<00:03:54.440> okay<00:03:55.370> he<00:03:55.609> jaan<00:03:56.480> e<00:03:56.510> has<00:03:56.690> nothing<00:03:57.079> so<00:03:57.380> often

00:03:57.789 --> 00:03:57.799 
like okay he jaan e has nothing so often

00:03:57.799 --> 00:03:59.650 
like okay he jaan e has nothing so often
here<00:03:57.980> let's<00:03:58.220> just<00:03:58.370> hope<00:03:58.549> we<00:03:58.700> lost<00:03:58.970> or

00:03:59.650 --> 00:03:59.660 
here let's just hope we lost or

00:03:59.660 --> 00:04:00.940 
here let's just hope we lost or
something<00:04:00.049> and<00:04:00.230> that's<00:04:00.410> why<00:04:00.590> you<00:04:00.650> check<00:04:00.919> a

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:00.950 
something and that's why you check a

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:03.629 
something and that's why you check a
king<00:04:01.250> reason<00:04:02.090> not<00:04:02.209> rejected<00:04:02.660> king<00:04:02.840> is<00:04:03.019> that

00:04:03.629 --> 00:04:03.639 
king reason not rejected king is that

00:04:03.639 --> 00:04:06.250 
king reason not rejected king is that
there's<00:04:04.639> almost<00:04:04.910> no<00:04:05.389> one<00:04:05.569> would<00:04:05.810> Bluff<00:04:06.079> on

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:06.260 
there's almost no one would Bluff on

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:10.059 
there's almost no one would Bluff on
this<00:04:06.470> in<00:04:06.680> this<00:04:06.829> situation<00:04:07.099> um<00:04:08.090> and<00:04:09.069> possibly

00:04:10.059 --> 00:04:10.069 
this in this situation um and possibly

00:04:10.069 --> 00:04:13.360 
this in this situation um and possibly
check<00:04:10.459> behind<00:04:10.790> semi<00:04:11.359> strong<00:04:11.660> hands<00:04:12.230> um<00:04:12.680> so

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:13.370 
check behind semi strong hands um so

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:15.640 
check behind semi strong hands um so
this<00:04:14.150> kind<00:04:14.540> of<00:04:14.599> gets<00:04:14.780> max<00:04:15.019> value<00:04:15.319> yeah<00:04:15.500> this

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:15.650 
this kind of gets max value yeah this

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:17.349 
this kind of gets max value yeah this
Johnny's<00:04:16.099> not<00:04:16.280> folding<00:04:16.669> Queen<00:04:16.849> time<00:04:17.060> he's<00:04:17.209> not

00:04:17.349 --> 00:04:17.359 
Johnny's not folding Queen time he's not

00:04:17.359 --> 00:04:18.969 
Johnny's not folding Queen time he's not
falling<00:04:17.539> cream<00:04:17.810> Jack<00:04:18.049> like<00:04:18.380> sure<00:04:18.650> it<00:04:18.859> is

00:04:18.969 --> 00:04:18.979 
falling cream Jack like sure it is

00:04:18.979 --> 00:04:20.500 
falling cream Jack like sure it is
probably<00:04:19.370> not<00:04:19.549> he's<00:04:19.729> not<00:04:19.760> folding<00:04:20.269> an<00:04:20.359> ace

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:20.510 
probably not he's not folding an ace

00:04:20.510 --> 00:04:22.450 
probably not he's not folding an ace
obviously<00:04:21.289> but<00:04:21.440> he<00:04:21.500> may<00:04:21.650> check<00:04:21.949> back<00:04:22.160> the<00:04:22.310> turn

00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:22.460 
obviously but he may check back the turn

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:24.880 
obviously but he may check back the turn
with<00:04:22.580> the<00:04:22.639> nice<00:04:22.820> i<00:04:23.000> mean<00:04:23.120> probably<00:04:23.510> won't<00:04:24.110> but

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:24.890 
with the nice i mean probably won't but

00:04:24.890 --> 00:04:27.399 
with the nice i mean probably won't but
he<00:04:24.979> could<00:04:25.280> and<00:04:25.789> we<00:04:26.450> should<00:04:26.780> probably<00:04:27.050> check

00:04:27.399 --> 00:04:27.409 
he could and we should probably check

00:04:27.409 --> 00:04:28.620 
he could and we should probably check
back<00:04:27.650> the<00:04:27.830> turn

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:28.630 
back the turn

00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:31.200 
back the turn
um<00:04:28.870> so<00:04:29.470> anyways<00:04:29.800> I<00:04:29.980> think<00:04:30.250> if<00:04:30.400> I<00:04:30.520> did<00:04:30.820> up<00:04:30.940> a<00:04:31.030> king

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:31.210 
um so anyways I think if I did up a king

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:32.790 
um so anyways I think if I did up a king
here<00:04:31.360> I<00:04:31.390> probably<00:04:31.690> leave<00:04:31.960> yeah<00:04:32.320> honestly

00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:32.800 
here I probably leave yeah honestly

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:34.830 
here I probably leave yeah honestly
unless<00:04:33.100> I<00:04:33.430> just<00:04:33.700> was<00:04:34.210> just<00:04:34.390> hoping<00:04:34.630> for

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:34.840 
unless I just was just hoping for

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:36.570 
unless I just was just hoping for
desperation<00:04:35.380> okay<00:04:35.770> yeah<00:04:36.130> I<00:04:36.160> think<00:04:36.280> I<00:04:36.430> myself

00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:36.580 
desperation okay yeah I think I myself

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:38.790 
desperation okay yeah I think I myself
sense<00:04:37.030> okay<00:04:37.510> so<00:04:37.570> this<00:04:37.840> is<00:04:38.050> basically<00:04:38.290> bad

00:04:38.790 --> 00:04:38.800 
sense okay so this is basically bad

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:43.170 
sense okay so this is basically bad
would<00:04:39.010> I<00:04:40.380> mean<00:04:41.380> I<00:04:41.590> think<00:04:41.860> it's<00:04:42.040> fine<00:04:42.310> I<00:04:42.640> would

00:04:43.170 --> 00:04:43.180 
would I mean I think it's fine I would

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:47.220 
would I mean I think it's fine I would

rather call to like so do you think if

00:04:47.230 --> 00:04:49.260 
rather call to like so do you think if

nothing this is I think what you have to
do<00:04:57.730> this<00:04:58.690> or<00:04:59.230> maybe<00:04:59.410> just<00:04:59.590> shell<00:04:59.980> it's<00:05:00.310> but

00:05:00.510 --> 00:05:00.520 
do this or maybe just shell it's but

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:02.910 
do this or maybe just shell it's but
just<00:05:00.760> just<00:05:00.940> because<00:05:01.360> um<00:05:01.840> well<00:05:02.770> you're<00:05:02.860> not

00:05:02.910 --> 00:05:02.920 
just just because um well you're not

00:05:02.920 --> 00:05:04.860 
just just because um well you're not
just<00:05:03.130> shoves<00:05:03.340> don't<00:05:03.880> think<00:05:04.060> you<00:05:04.120> should<00:05:04.150> mr.

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:04.870 
just shoves don't think you should mr.

00:05:04.870 --> 00:05:07.290 
just shoves don't think you should mr.
although<00:05:05.380> you<00:05:05.440> you<00:05:05.920> have<00:05:06.100> the<00:05:06.250> possibility<00:05:06.760> of

00:05:07.290 --> 00:05:07.300 
although you you have the possibility of

00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:09.750 
although you you have the possibility of
him<00:05:07.600> repop<00:05:08.260> English<00:05:08.620> although<00:05:09.130> that's<00:05:09.400> so<00:05:09.640> it

00:05:09.750 --> 00:05:09.760 
him repop English although that's so it

00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:11.850 
him repop English although that's so it
might<00:05:10.480> mean<00:05:10.630> oh<00:05:10.720> I<00:05:10.750> would<00:05:11.020> just<00:05:11.200> min<00:05:11.440> right<00:05:11.680> if

00:05:11.850 --> 00:05:11.860 
might mean oh I would just min right if

00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:13.350 
might mean oh I would just min right if
I<00:05:12.280> thought<00:05:12.490> it<00:05:12.580> was<00:05:12.640> loving<00:05:12.910> it<00:05:12.970> probably<00:05:13.300> just

00:05:13.350 --> 00:05:13.360 
I thought it was loving it probably just

00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:16.290 
I thought it was loving it probably just
manner<00:05:13.600> is<00:05:13.780> red<00:05:14.260> okay<00:05:14.440> I<00:05:15.070> mean<00:05:15.700> about<00:05:15.790> 180<00:05:16.180> s

00:05:16.290 --> 00:05:16.300 
manner is red okay I mean about 180 s

00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:18.180 
manner is red okay I mean about 180 s
basically<00:05:16.510> human<00:05:16.840> race<00:05:16.990> yeah<00:05:17.710> I<00:05:17.740> think<00:05:17.980> it

00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:18.190 
basically human race yeah I think it

00:05:18.190 --> 00:05:20.580 
basically human race yeah I think it
makes<00:05:18.340> sense<00:05:18.510> um<00:05:19.510> that<00:05:19.870> being<00:05:20.050> said<00:05:20.170> I<00:05:20.230> wanted

00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:20.590 
makes sense um that being said I wanted

00:05:20.590 --> 00:05:22.290 
makes sense um that being said I wanted
this<00:05:20.710> okay<00:05:21.190> probably<00:05:21.610> but<00:05:21.760> then<00:05:22.090> again<00:05:22.180> you

00:05:22.290 --> 00:05:22.300 
this okay probably but then again you

00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:24.120 
this okay probably but then again you
don't<00:05:22.450> have<00:05:22.540> one<00:05:22.720> a<00:05:22.750> lot<00:05:22.870> and<00:05:23.140> PA<00:05:23.470> we<00:05:23.920> always

00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:24.130 
don't have one a lot and PA we always

00:05:24.130 --> 00:05:27.030 
don't have one a lot and PA we always
underestimate<00:05:24.760> those<00:05:24.940> so<00:05:25.900> okay<00:05:26.620> you<00:05:26.920> know

try<00:05:51.460> to<00:05:51.520> get<00:05:51.670> the<00:05:51.730> max<00:05:51.910> value<00:05:53.340> the<00:05:54.340> FAQ<00:05:54.490> video

00:05:54.750 --> 00:05:54.760 
try to get the max value the FAQ video

00:05:54.760 --> 00:05:57.360 
try to get the max value the FAQ video
of<00:05:54.820> Italy<00:05:55.150> if<00:05:55.300> you<00:05:55.420> have<00:05:55.510> an<00:05:55.630> ace<00:05:56.190> honestly<00:05:57.190> I'd

00:05:57.360 --> 00:05:57.370 
of Italy if you have an ace honestly I'd

00:05:57.370 --> 00:05:59.670 
of Italy if you have an ace honestly I'd
probably<00:05:57.550> fold<00:05:57.900> the<00:05:58.900> fact<00:05:59.110> that<00:05:59.170> is<00:05:59.350> a<00:05:59.380> king

00:05:59.670 --> 00:05:59.680 
probably fold the fact that is a king

00:05:59.680 --> 00:06:01.440 
probably fold the fact that is a king
makes<00:05:59.950> it<00:06:00.100> less<00:06:00.280> likely<00:06:00.310> for<00:06:00.670> q2<00:06:01.060> have<00:06:01.180> a<00:06:01.210> king

00:06:01.440 --> 00:06:01.450 
makes it less likely for q2 have a king

00:06:01.450 --> 00:06:03.840 
makes it less likely for q2 have a king
and<00:06:01.660> therefore<00:06:02.280> you<00:06:03.280> know<00:06:03.340> sure<00:06:03.520> it's<00:06:03.640> called

00:06:03.840 --> 00:06:03.850 
and therefore you know sure it's called

00:06:03.850 --> 00:06:07.950 
and therefore you know sure it's called
I<00:06:04.950> agree
