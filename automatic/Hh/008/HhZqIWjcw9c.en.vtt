00:00:07.010 --> 00:00:07.020 
playing the game and I got into a bit of

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:08.900 
playing the game and I got into a bit of
a<00:00:07.109> predicament<00:00:07.319> where<00:00:07.950> I<00:00:08.010> had<00:00:08.189> to<00:00:08.400> do<00:00:08.610> a<00:00:08.639> bit<00:00:08.880> of

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:08.910 
a predicament where I had to do a bit of

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:10.490 
a predicament where I had to do a bit of
a<00:00:09.090> glitch<00:00:09.330> I<00:00:09.480> don't<00:00:09.660> really<00:00:09.840> enjoy<00:00:09.990> glitching

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:10.500 
a glitch I don't really enjoy glitching

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:12.560 
a glitch I don't really enjoy glitching
but<00:00:10.710> I<00:00:10.740> was<00:00:10.950> at<00:00:11.099> a<00:00:11.130> high<00:00:11.400> round<00:00:11.730> I<00:00:11.880> was<00:00:12.000> up<00:00:12.120> round

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:12.570 
but I was at a high round I was up round

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:15.860 
but I was at a high round I was up round
18<00:00:13.500> so<00:00:14.460> I<00:00:14.490> don't<00:00:14.730> really<00:00:14.940> want<00:00:15.120> to<00:00:15.150> die<00:00:15.360> and<00:00:15.719> I

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:15.870 
18 so I don't really want to die and I

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:17.630 
18 so I don't really want to die and I
glitched<00:00:16.199> the<00:00:16.350> game<00:00:16.560> and<00:00:16.800> then<00:00:17.010> I<00:00:17.039> figured<00:00:17.550> out

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:17.640 
glitched the game and then I figured out

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:19.910 
glitched the game and then I figured out
this<00:00:17.820> amazing<00:00:18.210> strategy<00:00:18.960> at<00:00:19.470> the<00:00:19.590> end<00:00:19.619> of<00:00:19.830> this

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:37.610 
punched goes like that and I have the
sweeper<00:00:34.670> couple<00:00:35.670> shots<00:00:35.910> it<00:00:36.540> does<00:00:36.780> that<00:00:37.050> the

00:00:38.959 --> 00:00:38.969 
best thing about the strategy is I don't

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:41.150 
best thing about the strategy is I don't
even<00:00:39.149> have<00:00:39.360> juggernaut<00:00:39.989> and<00:00:40.170> I<00:00:40.680> can<00:00:40.860> literally

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.160

close<00:01:06.270> to<00:01:06.570> the<00:01:06.689> door<00:01:06.810> they<00:01:06.960> cancel<00:01:07.320> out

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
close to the door they cancel out

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:10.820 
close to the door they cancel out
through<00:01:07.619> the<00:01:07.770> door<00:01:07.979> I<00:01:08.189> warn<00:01:08.580> you<00:01:09.500> don't<00:01:10.500> stand

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:10.830 
through the door I warn you don't stand

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:14.060 
through the door I warn you don't stand
here<00:01:10.950> like<00:01:11.430> I<00:01:11.610> did<00:01:11.960> stand<00:01:12.960> quite<00:01:13.380> relatively

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 
here like I did stand quite relatively

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:16.690 
here like I did stand quite relatively
far<00:01:14.310> back<00:01:14.549> I<00:01:14.850> normally<00:01:15.420> stand<00:01:15.659> around<00:01:15.869> here

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:16.700 
far back I normally stand around here

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:18.950 
far back I normally stand around here
anyways<00:01:17.700> as<00:01:17.909> I<00:01:18.030> was<00:01:18.060> saying<00:01:18.180> the<00:01:18.630> flaming

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 
anyways as I was saying the flaming

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:20.630 
anyways as I was saying the flaming
tomahawk<00:01:19.320> has<00:01:19.500> a<00:01:19.530> hold<00:01:19.799> on<00:01:19.950> so<00:01:20.100> I<00:01:20.159> think<00:01:20.220> for<00:01:20.520> as

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
tomahawk has a hold on so I think for as

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:22.730 
tomahawk has a hold on so I think for as
many<00:01:20.759> times<00:01:21.090> as<00:01:21.270> I<00:01:21.299> like<00:01:21.570> so<00:01:21.960> no<00:01:22.229> matter<00:01:22.470> what

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
many times as I like so no matter what

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:25.640 
many times as I like so no matter what
if<00:01:22.890> I<00:01:23.009> run<00:01:23.250> out<00:01:23.400> of<00:01:23.430> ammo

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650 
if I run out of ammo

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:27.920 
if I run out of ammo
I<00:01:25.680> can<00:01:26.189> always<00:01:26.520> gain<00:01:26.880> more<00:01:27.180> I<00:01:27.240> can<00:01:27.509> keep<00:01:27.720> from

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
I can always gain more I can keep from

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:30.200 
I can always gain more I can keep from
the<00:01:28.080> tomahawks<00:01:28.470> and<00:01:28.680> the<00:01:28.829> tomahawk<00:01:29.280> increases

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210 
the tomahawks and the tomahawk increases

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:34.370 
the tomahawks and the tomahawk increases
the<00:01:30.329> probability<00:01:30.930> of<00:01:31.140> drops<00:01:31.579> so<00:01:33.140> there<00:01:34.140> you<00:01:34.229> go

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 
the probability of drops so there you go

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:36.859 
the probability of drops so there you go
got<00:01:34.710> another<00:01:34.950> drop<00:01:35.189> right<00:01:35.430> there<00:01:35.540> so<00:01:36.540> this<00:01:36.689> is

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:36.869 
got another drop right there so this is

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:38.899 
got another drop right there so this is
the<00:01:36.990> strategy<00:01:37.470> I<00:01:37.500> want<00:01:37.860> to<00:01:37.979> show<00:01:38.159> you<00:01:38.220> guys<00:01:38.520> I'm

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:38.909 
the strategy I want to show you guys I'm

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:41.210 
the strategy I want to show you guys I'm
going<00:01:39.150> to<00:01:39.180> hate<00:01:39.450> to<00:01:39.600> have<00:01:39.689> to<00:01:39.869> end<00:01:40.049> this<00:01:40.259> if

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:41.220 
going to hate to have to end this if

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:43.609 
going to hate to have to end this if
I've<00:01:41.369> got<00:01:41.640> end<00:01:41.850> it<00:01:42.090> bang<00:01:42.630> got<00:01:42.990> double<00:01:43.320> points

00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:43.619 
I've got end it bang got double points

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:45.109 
I've got end it bang got double points
and<00:01:43.799> a<00:01:43.920> new<00:01:44.070> literally<00:01:44.670> you<00:01:44.790> guys<00:01:44.939> the
