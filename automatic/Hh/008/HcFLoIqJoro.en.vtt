buzzes Marvel icons line these are

figures<00:00:14.790> I<00:00:14.910> own<00:00:16.369> these<00:00:17.369> came<00:00:17.640> out<00:00:17.789> I<00:00:18.920> guess<00:00:19.920> it

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:20.039 
figures I own these came out I guess it

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:21.290 
figures I own these came out I guess it
would<00:00:20.130> have<00:00:20.220> been<00:00:20.310> about<00:00:20.400> three<00:00:21.029> or<00:00:21.150> four

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:21.300 
would have been about three or four

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:25.099 
would have been about three or four
years<00:00:21.539> ago<00:00:21.630> I<00:00:22.140> think<00:00:23.359> these<00:00:24.359> were<00:00:24.570> essentially

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:25.109

hole right there for the tongue and just
it<00:04:28.260> just<00:04:28.290> pigs<00:04:28.680> back<00:04:28.860> into<00:04:29.220> place<00:04:29.510> really

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:30.510 
it just pigs back into place really

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:37.910 
it just pigs back into place really
easily<00:04:35.930> of<00:04:36.930> course<00:04:37.020> now<00:04:37.320> that<00:04:37.350> I<00:04:37.530> said<00:04:37.770> it's

00:04:37.910 --> 00:04:37.920 
easily of course now that I said it's

00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:40.400 
easily of course now that I said it's
easy<00:04:38.190> it's<00:04:38.790> gonna<00:04:38.880> give<00:04:39.120> me<00:04:39.150> a<00:04:39.290> difficulty<00:04:40.290> but

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:40.410 
easy it's gonna give me a difficulty but

00:04:40.410 --> 00:04:41.960 
easy it's gonna give me a difficulty but
it's<00:04:40.650> really<00:04:40.920> not<00:04:41.040> that<00:04:41.100> hard<00:04:41.460> to<00:04:41.550> stick<00:04:41.790> back

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:41.970 
it's really not that hard to stick back

00:04:41.970 --> 00:04:45.110 
it's really not that hard to stick back
in<00:04:42.920> so<00:04:43.920> now<00:04:44.220> we<00:04:44.280> will<00:04:44.550> take<00:04:44.730> a<00:04:44.790> look<00:04:44.970> at<00:04:45.060> the

00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:45.120 
in so now we will take a look at the

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:51.620
