00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.899
 hello how am I caleb ortiz promaster 

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:06.270
 organic nights this time I want 

00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:08.880
 present you a design for living room with the 

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:11.519
 that the pro for which prepare with 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:13.799
 anticipation a nail extension 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:15.960
 natural with bright acrylic petal 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:18.720
 collection which I recommend you to be 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:20.910
 the thin application to apply the 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:25.109
 care pro to start with our 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:28.619
 design is necessary to apply protein bon 

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:32.900
 on the entire acrylic surface for 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:32.900
 Greater adherence of the color gel 

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:41.010
 previously agitated I'm going to apply two 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:43.920
 layers of care procolor white 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:46.550
 in a uniform manner from line of 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:46.550
 cuticle 

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:54.630
 I'm applying in a way 

00:00:52.630 --> 00:00:58.460
 soft 

00:00:54.630 --> 00:00:58.460
 if you do not forget to find tips 

00:00:58.970 --> 00:01:05.320
 and it takes to cure for 30 seconds 

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:08.500
 at the stop of 30 4 

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:11.300
 once cured the white 101 I'm going to 

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:16.760
 use the following colors 

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:20.990
 geli blue mall bat 0 blue peron 

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:23.680
 barry fruit and pitahaya fruit which 

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:26.710
 I will go alternating 

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:29.850
 in a soft way 

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:34.280
 with little product 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:34.280
 This way I will place 

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:42.800
 and supporting me with a master gel brush 

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:45.310
 aluminum and a house soaked in Sinai 

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:45.310
 and white 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:52.010
 you can use any other brush 

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:52.010
 that is thin 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:57.780
 and I will perform 

00:01:55.580 --> 00:02:00.750
 this blur 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:05.090
 to the direction that you like in this 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:05.090
 occasion I am applying it 

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:11.450
 in a way 

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:15.610
 diagonal 

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:15.610
 to continue with the next color 

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:23.280
 now in tip applied to the margin 

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:30.930
 enough product 

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:30.930
 and again I do the same process 

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:39.220
 I'm blurring in this case towards 

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:39.220
 up towards cuticle very slowly 

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:49.880
 to later take it to the 

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:52.580
 lamp for 30 seconds here you can 

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:55.340
 appreciate how I made the other colors 

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:57.830
 in the same way now we are going to seal 

00:02:55.340 --> 00:03:02.650
 the colors with which he created 

00:02:57.830 --> 00:03:02.650
 lacker prokom previously shaken 

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:12.769
 and we are going to apply it from the line of 

00:03:06.959 --> 00:03:12.769
 cuticle by the central part slowly 

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:19.580
 without forgetting to seal tips 

00:03:16.319 --> 00:03:23.390
 and lateral jazz 

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:25.330
 to take to cure in lamp 24 4 by 

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:27.820
 30 seconds 

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:31.090
 once the curing time has elapsed 

00:03:27.820 --> 00:03:34.270
 I will not eliminate what is the 

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:38.140
 oxygen inhibition I will continue with 

00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:40.480
 the decoration supporting me from a crystal and 

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:42.900
 in which I try to place two 

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:42.900
 droplets 

00:03:44.770 --> 00:03:51.250
 and I will support myself from the following 

00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:55.230
 glitter cosmo glitter sky cosmos and jet 

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:59.780
 cosmos with a cuticle pusher 

00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:59.780
 I'm going to take a small proportion 

00:03:59.870 --> 00:04:04.810
 of each color to make a mixture 

00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:12.870
 supporting me with a brush in this case the 

00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:15.970
 master gel aluminum to mix it 

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:17.760
 perfectly and we have a mix 

00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:22.410
 homogeneous 

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:25.280
 clean to for clean to mix the 

00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:25.280
 jet cosmos 

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:34.080
 Yes now 

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:37.560
 I'm going to take it to the nail 

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:39.490
 first the sky cosmos with a 

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:43.280
 perlite 

00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:46.700
 and I'm going to start putting it 

00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:51.440
 in turn, you can even 

00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:55.340
 play with the positions of this leader or 

00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:57.530
 even with a different color 

00:04:55.340 --> 00:05:03.250
 and this time I'm doing it 

00:04:57.530 --> 00:05:03.250
 for the colors they use as a base 

00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:08.100
 we are contouring perfectly 

00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:15.440
 and it needs to be an application 

00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:15.440
 uniform 

00:05:15.810 --> 00:05:19.550
 and very well delineated 

00:05:23.220 --> 00:05:29.150
 then the cosmos jet of it 

00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:29.150
 way 

00:05:29.920 --> 00:05:33.150
 on another side 

00:05:35.639 --> 00:05:41.490
 the me not having withdrawn the inhibition 

00:05:39.210 --> 00:05:46.939
 of oxygen will allow me greater 

00:05:41.490 --> 00:05:46.939
 mobility when making this design 

00:05:47.650 --> 00:05:55.009
 you can play with different 

00:05:49.509 --> 00:05:58.139
 positions with different strokes even 

00:05:55.009 --> 00:06:02.650
 or different figures 

00:05:58.139 --> 00:06:05.750
 go cleaning the brush perfectly 

00:06:02.650 --> 00:06:08.630
 to prevent the leader 

00:06:05.750 --> 00:06:12.190
 we stay out 

00:06:08.630 --> 00:06:12.190
 of what we want to achieve 

00:06:15.270 --> 00:06:20.120
 in this way it delineates perfectly 

00:06:24.889 --> 00:06:30.560
 to later take it to the 

00:06:26.780 --> 00:06:31.990
 24 watt lamp for only 30 

00:06:30.560 --> 00:06:34.240
 seconds 

00:06:31.990 --> 00:06:36.310
 once the curing time has elapsed 

00:06:34.240 --> 00:06:40.540
 now I am going to clean with gauze 

00:06:36.310 --> 00:06:43.070
 drenched white film and remove the 

00:06:40.540 --> 00:06:45.850
 inhibition layer 

00:06:43.070 --> 00:06:45.850
 in this way 

00:06:45.969 --> 00:06:51.279
 we clean perfectly and that 's how 

00:06:49.149 --> 00:06:53.529
 our design remains without forgetting 

00:06:51.279 --> 00:06:55.659
 consent to our client applying 

00:06:53.529 --> 00:06:58.779
 a light cap of oil for 

00:06:55.659 --> 00:07:02.349
 cuticle if you can notice me 

00:06:58.779 --> 00:07:03.669
 alternate the gliders in a way in the 

00:07:02.349 --> 00:07:07.299
 index finger 

00:07:03.669 --> 00:07:11.289
 only effect chrome strokes even 

00:07:07.299 --> 00:07:13.599
 I left a smooth nail completely for 

00:07:11.289 --> 00:07:15.909
 appreciate the blurring and that's how 

00:07:13.599 --> 00:07:18.929
 is our design I am cale athlete 

00:07:15.909 --> 00:07:18.929
 and see you in the next
