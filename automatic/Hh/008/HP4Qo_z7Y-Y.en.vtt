00:00:10.959 --> 00:00:18.320
 the beauty bus calls back to 

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:20.119
 another series of videos here in our 

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:23.000
 channel on youtube 

00:00:20.119 --> 00:00:27.970
 we are in crisis the dollar going pras 

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:29.480
 cucuias inflation as that is our 

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:32.739
 gas 

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:35.410
 efe the difficult time difficult and extensive 

00:00:32.739 --> 00:00:40.480
 nearby are thinking about it 

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:45.710
 I decided to make a new series of videos 

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:51.550
 riding the world or how to ride one with 

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:51.550
 the world with up to 1,500 reais 

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:59.680
 the idea is this series of web videos 

00:00:55.870 --> 00:01:01.300
 what's real and see what people 

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:04.350
 can buy quality that the 

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:08.320
 People can ride a pedal where 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:13.540
 cool quality the idea is to get 

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:20.229
 pen board pedals cables and fountain 

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:22.410
 all with the real technique in 

00:01:20.229 --> 00:01:22.410
 money 

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:37.470
 the idea will be to unite these two of these 

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:45.160
 two things some things 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:48.000
 first let's be selling in brazil 

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:51.340
 I'm not going to do anything because 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:54.220
 first, the crazy dowry is very 

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:54.940
 difficult to predict final value while 

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:58.690
 stay 

00:01:54.940 --> 00:02:01.000
 according to customs on the right delay for 

00:01:58.690 --> 00:02:03.220
 release and it never takes that long 

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:06.610
 to make this series of videos 

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:09.130
 So I'm going to show Brazil, too. 

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:10.660
 I'm going to the number that falls to legalize the 

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:14.380
 imported officially 

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:19.739
 it is obvious that many brands unfortunately 

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:28.540
 ends up being left out because a real 

00:02:19.739 --> 00:02:31.090
 drive brand gringa of the Brazilian value 

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:35.769
 that can work well 

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:38.320
 the lower value the idea is to capture the 

00:02:35.769 --> 00:02:39.910
 opportunities and work within this 

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:40.810
 value to see who can ride 

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:45.600
 quality 

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:49.750
 after showing it shows mounted 

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:51.880
 what sounds what kind of toll 

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:56.590
 find team units can 

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:57.950
 extract from them then this idea 

00:02:56.590 --> 00:02:59.750
 liked the idea 

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:03.170
 writes the channel to follow the 

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:05.510
 other videos leave in the comments of 

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:06.620
 toll shop to buy marks 

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:08.930
 should search 

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:11.510
 I really wanted to have the partnership 

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:13.730
 of you guys to research and find the 

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:17.180
 best options on the market 

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:19.670

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:22.459

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:24.500

00:03:22.459 --> 00:03:27.769
