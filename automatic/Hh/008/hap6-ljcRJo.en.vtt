00:00:00.359 --> 00:00:04.080
 party as an entertainment but it 

00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:06.540
 transformed into a disease a 

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:08.340
 video game is the addiction of a young 19 

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:10.349
 years that his father has the truth

 up to 10 hours and they have had to give 

00:00:12.209 --> 00:00:16.230
 sleeping pills the experts 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:17.790
 recommend paying attention to small 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:22.310
 attitudes to know if they are or not 

00:00:17.790 --> 00:00:22.310
 facing an extreme case of addiction 

00:00:23.030 --> 00:00:25.810
 two 

00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:31.870
 that all things have a limit 

00:00:29.290 --> 00:00:34.650
 Look, old man lets me know by voice and 

00:00:31.870 --> 00:00:34.650
 that excites me 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:49.610
 detachment 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:52.640
 it's a training 

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:59.660
 Rafael's family life changed and everything 

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:01.880
 for a huge addiction that his son's 

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:04.370
 19 years has a video game that 

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:06.080
 works online calculates that 

00:01:04.370 --> 00:01:08.090
 more than a year ago he began to approach the 

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:10.250
 computer there where he took more 

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:15.380
 importance but now you do not know what 

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:17.510
 do with it but I'm going to do 7 

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:19.460
 eight hours then when I check 

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:20.869
 the computer records gave me 

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:24.310
 account that the match is the day and 

00:01:20.869 --> 00:01:26.470
 finished the morning issues 

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:28.509
 and see that this interview is hidden 

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:30.460
 because he knows that his son's reaction 

00:01:28.509 --> 00:01:33.520
 will not be the best have tried to talk 

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:36.570
 without reason little by little he has been assuming that 

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:36.570
 your son is sick 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:46.409
 my son who did not eat cheese meals 

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:49.450
 cool computer hey eats not eat not 

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:51.700
 It takes a lot of coffee, it consumes a jar that 

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:53.619
 they make two events three weeks the 

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:55.270
 measures have been drastic since the 

00:01:53.619 --> 00:01:57.399
 internet cut up even 

00:01:55.270 --> 00:02:06.130
 medicines to calm your anxiety in 

00:01:57.399 --> 00:02:08.470
 the night is desperate the young man of 19 

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:10.869
 years is obsessed with world of 

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:13.269
 warcraft a video game that is massive in 

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:15.370
 line plus the players connect and 

00:02:13.269 --> 00:02:17.560
 they play at the same time one of the most 

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:19.239
 popular in its kind that has reached 11 

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:21.819
 millions of players in the world 

00:02:19.239 --> 00:02:23.890
 creating characters arming strategies and 

00:02:21.819 --> 00:02:26.049
 advancing in stages are some of the 

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:29.030
 reasons that cause young people to be 

00:02:26.049 --> 00:02:32.370
 so many hours in front of the computer 

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:35.460
 games for entertaining that you do not have 

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:37.680
 proper control of the person can 

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:39.510
 let's say you fall into the habit that you like 

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:42.390
 too much and there's falling in a bit in this 

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:44.340
 bar the edition the official site obliges 

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:46.740
 in many cases to pay to continue 

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:49.140
 advancing another of the concerns of 

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:51.110
 Rafael his son does not work but he got 

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:53.820
 open an account with a credit card 

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:56.340
 member of the family gives him money 

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:57.450
 without parental authorization there is no 

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:58.740
 no type of control in 

00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:00.570
 anyone that has to be a 

00:02:58.740 --> 00:03:06.300
 credit card live of mind 

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:08.220
 pending nothing can drop a game is 

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:10.080
 proven that video games could 

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:12.570
 develop new skills in 

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:14.580
 children the stimuli given serve and 

00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:15.930
 it is not bad that they use it the theme is the 

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:18.840
 time and control 

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:21.209
 Rafael has not been able to do anything with his son 

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:22.819
 many have given accounts leave a lot 

00:03:21.209 --> 00:03:25.040
 when your son alone 

00:03:22.819 --> 00:03:26.209
 I am that mea culpa I do not assume for 

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:28.879
 add up at least lack little communication 

00:03:26.209 --> 00:03:32.130
 not to worry about their interests what 

00:03:28.879 --> 00:03:33.930
 what do you want it to be 

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:36.120
 but I think that at least we already 

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:40.160
 we realized and hopefully serve what I 

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:40.160
 I'm telling you if you were not enough other 

00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:47.269
 being locked in the isolated piece 

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:49.129
 of the world is a syndrome that has 

00:03:47.269 --> 00:03:51.530
 15 years became a great 

00:03:49.129 --> 00:03:54.019
 problem in Japanese society not 

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:56.810
 they eat they do not sleep they are just connected to 

00:03:54.019 --> 00:03:58.580
 the network and kiko die sharp performance 

00:03:56.810 --> 00:04:00.200
 it's still a headache for 

00:03:58.580 --> 00:04:02.780
 this society more than one million 

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:04.849
 Japanese already suffer in Chile only 

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:06.560
 isolated cases but it is already a subject for 

00:04:04.849 --> 00:04:08.090
 worry if you start to see 

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:09.980
 Behavioral alterations began 

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:12.140
 perceive irritable began to perceive 

00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:13.819
 what locked him self little communicative 

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:15.440
 little affectionate I begin to realize 

00:04:13.819 --> 00:04:18.169
 that what maybe before told me already 

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:20.090
 he does not tell me I start to see that maybe 

00:04:18.169 --> 00:04:21.829
 with friends that previously shared already 

00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:24.229
 does not share so much is locked in its 

00:04:21.829 --> 00:04:27.040
 piece is symptoms that denote a boy 

00:04:24.229 --> 00:04:27.040
 that thought 

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:33.680
 Rafael tried everything he supervised the 

00:04:31.730 --> 00:04:35.960
 computer of his son and tried to cut 

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:37.730
 videogames the company that I had 

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:39.560
 of the internet he suggested installing a 

00:04:37.730 --> 00:04:42.100
 program that finally complicated the 

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:42.100
 situation 

00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:50.180
 and is aware that this addiction is 

00:04:48.410 --> 00:04:52.820
 he escaped from his hands he does not want to 

00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:54.770
 for defeated at age 19 still believes 

00:04:52.820 --> 00:04:57.070
 who can recover the essence of his 

00:04:54.770 --> 00:04:57.070
 son 

00:05:06.289 --> 00:05:15.139
 as a family because the whole family 

00:05:10.930 --> 00:05:17.539
 the second to make this go to 

00:05:15.139 --> 00:05:19.419
 provoke in him the lack of right of 

00:05:17.539 --> 00:05:21.439
 home how are you talking about an addiction 

00:05:19.419 --> 00:05:23.659
 you work from point of view 

00:05:21.439 --> 00:05:26.360
 psychiatric either with medications that 

00:05:23.659 --> 00:05:28.999
 manage anxiety and manage 

00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:31.069
 stabilized in the mood and from the point of 

00:05:28.999 --> 00:05:32.569
 therapeutic view in which you are going to 

00:05:31.069 --> 00:05:34.580
 person 

00:05:32.569 --> 00:05:36.830
 giving reality judgment and focusing your 

00:05:34.580 --> 00:05:38.869
 conduct the law of video games 

00:05:36.830 --> 00:05:40.969
 enacted two months ago does not contemplate 

00:05:38.869 --> 00:05:43.580
 digital downloads with games like 

00:05:40.969 --> 00:05:46.189
 this one does not have regulation needs help 

00:05:43.580 --> 00:05:49.300
 and making it public is the first stage 

00:05:46.189 --> 00:05:49.300
 I know what generational difference 

00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:57.460
 different 

00:05:54.550 --> 00:06:00.420
 but in some way or another 

00:05:57.460 --> 00:06:00.420
 they approach and good to understand 

00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:07.039
 we could be facing a new case 

00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:09.259
 of the so - called icc ico moore syndrome and 

00:06:07.039 --> 00:06:11.599
 an addiction that seemed distant but 

00:06:09.259 --> 00:06:13.310
 that today Raphael assumes what is important is 

00:06:11.599 --> 00:06:15.560
 who knows that his son is sick there 

00:06:13.310 --> 00:06:17.599
 to see him locked in the isolated piece 

00:06:15.560 --> 00:06:20.169
 of the world is an attitude that should 

00:06:17.599 --> 00:06:20.169
 worry
