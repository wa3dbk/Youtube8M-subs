00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:16.609
 like a hit with an interesting name asshole 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:19.340
 superman as if in daily use as well 

00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:22.410
 sporting plan called kick arrow 

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:23.789
 that is, he is almost in Thai boxing 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:26.609
 not used but quite often 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:27.650
 used in kickboxing by the rules 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:30.150
 K-1 

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:33.829
 classic boxing is also not used 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:37.110
 in general, but according to the rules and in the kick 

00:00:33.829 --> 00:00:40.500
 pretty pretty used 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:43.860
 often zambidis likes to punch him too 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:46.500
 for the euro, the indigenous fighters are used 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:49.800
 It does not use, of course, people from 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:53.010
 Europe, too, quite often punch 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:55.079
 it does not give so much the knockout knockout 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:58.379
 this blow is very hard to send 

00:00:55.079 --> 00:01:02.570
 I put the enemy was pretty and average 

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:02.570
 level what to send such a blow but 

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:09.240
 perceptible damage to the enemy can 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:11.970
 cause and you can shout it and psyche 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:12.750
 loosen your rich arsenal 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:17.070
 hitting 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:19.520
 that is to say so intimidate 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:23.130
 intimidate by the fact that you know not only 

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:24.960
 Kiki about my yes I know they write rite 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:27.570

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:34.890
 you work deal with a flashy blow in what 

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:37.920
 what is the impact of work on 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:40.460
 distances is a big distance and we 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:40.460

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:57.240
 what is the essence of the strike you are standing at a distance 

00:01:53.729 --> 00:02:00.500
 kick perform jump jumping lunge 

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:04.020

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:07.109
 the enemy standing small stands he is distracted by 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:09.899
 knee lowering hands usually want a knee 

00:02:07.109 --> 00:02:11.370
 meet with hands or meet beat 

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:14.069
 hands or repel 

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:16.739
 and the knobs are lowered accordingly and in 

00:02:14.069 --> 00:02:19.079
 this moment you punch straight that is 

00:02:16.739 --> 00:02:22.049

 purely pure as far as you have 

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:26.400
 the hand itself is developed as far as you are by weight 

00:03:24.299 --> 00:03:27.880
