00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:47.810 
referred to us full-frame let's capture
photo<00:00:46.680> with<00:00:46.829> this<00:00:46.980> setup<00:00:47.190> and<00:00:47.460> move<00:00:47.579> it<00:00:47.730> over

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820 
photo with this setup and move it over

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:49.490 
photo with this setup and move it over
to<00:00:48.120> the<00:00:48.210> right<00:00:48.390> so<00:00:48.570> we<00:00:48.600> can<00:00:48.690> take<00:00:48.960> a<00:00:48.989> look<00:00:49.200> at<00:00:49.379> it

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500 
to the right so we can take a look at it

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:50.529 
to the right so we can take a look at it
later

00:00:50.529 --> 00:00:50.539 
later

00:00:50.539 --> 00:00:54.260 
later
so<00:00:51.539> when<00:00:52.079> the<00:00:52.170> digital<00:00:52.350> era<00:00:52.680> came<00:00:52.980> about<00:00:53.270> DSLR

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270 
so when the digital era came about DSLR

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:56.299 
so when the digital era came about DSLR
manufacturers<00:00:55.020> realize<00:00:55.469> the<00:00:55.680> high<00:00:55.829> costs

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
manufacturers realize the high costs

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:57.950 
manufacturers realize the high costs
associated<00:00:56.850> with<00:00:56.940> manufacturing<00:00:57.719> large

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 
associated with manufacturing large

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:00.950 
associated with manufacturing large
sensors<00:00:58.640> therefore<00:00:59.640> they<00:01:00.239> decided<00:01:00.539> to<00:01:00.719> put

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 
sensors therefore they decided to put

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:03.139 
sensors therefore they decided to put
smaller<00:01:01.320> sensors<00:01:01.859> and<00:01:02.039> most<00:01:02.219> DSLRs<00:01:02.820> to<00:01:03.000> make

00:01:03.139 --> 00:01:03.149 
smaller sensors and most DSLRs to make

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:05.479 
smaller sensors and most DSLRs to make
them<00:01:03.329> accessible<00:01:03.600> consumers<00:01:04.409> and<00:01:04.650> they<00:01:05.339> only

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
them accessible consumers and they only

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:07.340 
them accessible consumers and they only
left<00:01:05.760> full-frame<00:01:06.210> sensors<00:01:06.689> in<00:01:06.869> very<00:01:07.080> high-end

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
left full-frame sensors in very high-end

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:10.130 
left full-frame sensors in very high-end
cameras<00:01:08.090> take<00:01:09.090> a<00:01:09.119> look<00:01:09.390> at<00:01:09.479> the<00:01:09.600> illustration

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
cameras take a look at the illustration

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:11.899 
cameras take a look at the illustration
on<00:01:10.229> the<00:01:10.290> left<00:01:10.560> and<00:01:10.799> notice<00:01:11.040> how<00:01:11.189> the<00:01:11.250> rectangle

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:13.340 
on the left and notice how the rectangle
representing<00:01:12.450> the<00:01:12.540> sensor<00:01:12.900> has<00:01:13.020> become

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 
representing the sensor has become

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:13.969 
representing the sensor has become
smaller

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979

photo and save it on the right side of
the<00:01:25.890> screen<00:01:26.450> do<00:01:27.450> you<00:01:27.540> notice<00:01:27.720> anything

00:01:28.179 --> 00:01:28.189 
the screen do you notice anything

00:01:28.189 --> 00:01:30.560 
the screen do you notice anything
because<00:01:29.189> the<00:01:29.310> sensor<00:01:29.670> size<00:01:29.850> has<00:01:30.030> been<00:01:30.180> reduced

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570 
because the sensor size has been reduced

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:32.149 
because the sensor size has been reduced
the<00:01:30.900> camera<00:01:31.229> can<00:01:31.380> only<00:01:31.470> see<00:01:31.770> a<00:01:31.799> smaller

with the aps-c camera look the same it's

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:05.389 
with the aps-c camera look the same it's
important<00:02:04.020> to<00:02:04.110> note<00:02:04.290> that<00:02:04.320> this<00:02:04.619> crop<00:02:04.950> format

00:02:05.389 --> 00:02:05.399 
important to note that this crop format

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:06.980 
important to note that this crop format
lens<00:02:05.640> would<00:02:05.880> still<00:02:06.149> have<00:02:06.270> a<00:02:06.299> focal<00:02:06.689> length<00:02:06.719> of

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:06.990 
lens would still have a focal length of

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:09.919 
lens would still have a focal length of
50<00:02:07.320> millimeters<00:02:07.829> on<00:02:08.039> aps-c<00:02:08.879> it<00:02:09.629> still

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:09.929 
50 millimeters on aps-c it still

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:11.660 
50 millimeters on aps-c it still
delivers<00:02:10.319> the<00:02:10.410> same<00:02:10.649> field<00:02:10.920> of<00:02:11.069> view<00:02:11.129> as<00:02:11.489> the

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:11.670 
delivers the same field of view as the

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:12.559 
delivers the same field of view as the
full-frame<00:02:12.030> 50

00:02:12.559 --> 00:02:12.569 
full-frame 50

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:14.259 
full-frame 50
but<00:02:12.989> it<00:02:13.109> can<00:02:13.230> be<00:02:13.349> made<00:02:13.499> smaller<00:02:13.829> and<00:02:14.099> cheaper

00:02:14.259 --> 00:02:14.269 
but it can be made smaller and cheaper

00:02:14.269 --> 00:02:17.119 
but it can be made smaller and cheaper
the<00:02:15.269> only<00:02:15.480> caveat<00:02:15.689> is<00:02:16.109> that<00:02:16.200> the<00:02:16.469> smaller<00:02:16.769> 50

00:02:17.119 --> 00:02:17.129 
the only caveat is that the smaller 50

00:02:17.129 --> 00:02:18.949 
the only caveat is that the smaller 50
millimeter<00:02:17.549> wouldn't<00:02:18.209> be<00:02:18.269> usable<00:02:18.659> on<00:02:18.749> full

00:02:18.949 --> 00:02:18.959 
millimeter wouldn't be usable on full

00:02:18.959 --> 00:02:20.270 
millimeter wouldn't be usable on full
frame<00:02:19.139> because<00:02:19.650> it<00:02:19.680> wouldn't<00:02:20.010> completely

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:20.280 
frame because it wouldn't completely

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:22.970 
frame because it wouldn't completely
cover<00:02:20.670> the<00:02:20.760> larger<00:02:21.209> sensor<00:02:21.569> so<00:02:22.530> what's<00:02:22.829> the

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:22.980 
cover the larger sensor so what's the

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:23.750 
cover the larger sensor so what's the
bottom<00:02:23.099> line

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:23.760 
bottom line

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:26.059 
bottom line
the<00:02:24.239> only<00:02:24.629> implication<00:02:25.409> of<00:02:25.499> the<00:02:25.620> crop<00:02:25.829> factor

00:02:26.059 --> 00:02:26.069 
the only implication of the crop factor

00:02:26.069 --> 00:02:28.520 
the only implication of the crop factor
is<00:02:26.430> a<00:02:26.459> reduced<00:02:26.849> field<00:02:27.120> of<00:02:27.269> view<00:02:27.420> it<00:02:28.230> does<00:02:28.409> not

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:28.530 
is a reduced field of view it does not

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:30.470 
is a reduced field of view it does not
magnify<00:02:29.189> the<00:02:29.250> image<00:02:29.519> or<00:02:29.760> give<00:02:29.879> you<00:02:29.969> more<00:02:30.180> zoom

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:30.480 
magnify the image or give you more zoom

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:32.479 
magnify the image or give you more zoom
and<00:02:30.780> it<00:02:31.170> doesn't<00:02:31.469> modify<00:02:31.739> the<00:02:31.920> behavior<00:02:32.129> of

and it doesn't modify the behavior of

00:02:32.489 --> 00:02:35.030 
and it doesn't modify the behavior of
full-frame<00:02:32.969> lenses<00:02:33.560> but<00:02:34.560> it's<00:02:34.739> a<00:02:34.829> very

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:35.040 
full-frame lenses but it's a very

using a 50 millimeter lens on aps-c this
back-and-forth<00:02:51.389> conversion<00:02:51.989> is<00:02:52.109> what<00:02:52.260> causes

00:02:52.429 --> 00:02:52.439 
back-and-forth conversion is what causes

00:02:52.439 --> 00:02:54.979 
back-and-forth conversion is what causes
all<00:02:52.709> the<00:02:52.829> confusion<00:02:53.540> therefore<00:02:54.540> the<00:02:54.840> best

00:02:54.979 --> 00:02:54.989 
all the confusion therefore the best

all the confusion therefore the best
thing<00:02:55.230> to<00:02:55.260> do<00:02:55.500> is<00:02:55.650> to<00:02:55.769> forget<00:02:56.069> all<00:02:56.280> about<00:02:56.310> the
