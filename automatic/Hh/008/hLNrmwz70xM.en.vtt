improvements in sort of the overall T
touch<00:00:35.460> expert<00:00:36.059> collection<00:00:36.510> because<00:00:36.690> it<00:00:36.719> would

00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:36.989 
touch expert collection because it would

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:38.510 
touch expert collection because it would
it<00:00:37.140> would<00:00:37.260> be<00:00:37.320> considered<00:00:37.860> as<00:00:37.950> part<00:00:38.010> of<00:00:38.250> the<00:00:38.309> T

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:38.520 
it would be considered as part of the T

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:40.940 
it would be considered as part of the T
touch<00:00:38.700> expert<00:00:39.270> line<00:00:39.450> because<00:00:40.440> it<00:00:40.559> does<00:00:40.739> have

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:40.950 
touch expert line because it does have

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:42.350 
touch expert line because it does have
that<00:00:41.100> movement<00:00:41.370> but<00:00:41.700> it<00:00:41.790> does<00:00:41.969> have<00:00:42.149> some

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:42.360 
that movement but it does have some

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:45.290 
that movement but it does have some
special<00:00:42.899> features<00:00:43.140> as<00:00:43.530> a<00:00:43.620> diving<00:00:44.460> watch<00:00:44.610> the

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300 
special features as a diving watch the

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:48.979 
special features as a diving watch the

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
biggest complaint with the T touch

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:51.590 
biggest complaint with the T touch
watches<00:00:49.680> you<00:00:50.190> know<00:00:50.309> historically<00:00:50.789> has<00:00:51.570> been

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600 
watches you know historically has been

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:53.689 
watches you know historically has been
water<00:00:52.170> resistance<00:00:52.860> a<00:00:53.070> lot<00:00:53.370> of<00:00:53.460> people

00:00:53.689 --> 00:00:53.699 
water resistance a lot of people

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:54.830 
water resistance a lot of people
complain<00:00:54.090> that<00:00:54.120> they<00:00:54.390> weren't<00:00:54.570> water

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840 
complain that they weren't water

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:56.810 
complain that they weren't water
resistant<00:00:55.440> enough<00:00:55.710> water<00:00:56.070> was<00:00:56.309> getting<00:00:56.640> in

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
resistant enough water was getting in

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:59.389 
resistant enough water was getting in
and<00:00:57.230> you<00:00:58.230> know<00:00:58.320> that<00:00:58.469> was<00:00:58.649> that<00:00:58.829> was<00:00:59.100> screwing

00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399 
and you know that was that was screwing

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:01.279 
and you know that was that was screwing
up<00:00:59.609> the<00:00:59.730> movement<00:01:00.210> and<00:01:00.390> things<00:01:00.510> like<00:01:00.780> that<00:01:01.050> and

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289 
up the movement and things like that and

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:04.969 
up the movement and things like that and
-<00:01:01.949> so<00:01:02.129> spend<00:01:02.579> a<00:01:02.789> good<00:01:03.480> number<00:01:03.840> of<00:01:03.870> years<00:01:04.229> you

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 
- so spend a good number of years you

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:06.800 
- so spend a good number of years you
know<00:01:05.010> working<00:01:05.549> on<00:01:05.700> that<00:01:05.909> making<00:01:06.180> sure<00:01:06.330> that

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
know working on that making sure that

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:09.679 
know working on that making sure that
that<00:01:07.170> changed<00:01:07.860> so<00:01:08.130> when<00:01:09.060> they<00:01:09.180> released<00:01:09.540> a

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:09.689 
that changed so when they released a

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:12.350 
that changed so when they released a
dive<00:01:09.960> watch<00:01:10.350> I<00:01:10.710> thought<00:01:11.040> to<00:01:11.220> myself<00:01:11.400> okay

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 
dive watch I thought to myself okay

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:15.320 
dive watch I thought to myself okay
um<00:01:12.860> you<00:01:13.860> know<00:01:13.979> you've<00:01:14.430> had<00:01:14.610> all<00:01:14.760> these<00:01:14.909> issues

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
um you know you've had all these issues

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:16.820 
um you know you've had all these issues
in<00:01:15.479> the<00:01:15.570> past<00:01:15.780> a<00:01:16.080> little<00:01:16.200> bit<00:01:16.439> with<00:01:16.590> water

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
in the past a little bit with water

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:18.320 
in the past a little bit with water
resistance<00:01:17.400> now<00:01:17.549> have<00:01:17.640> a<00:01:17.700> dive<00:01:17.880> watch<00:01:18.150> and

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
resistance now have a dive watch and

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:20.510 
resistance now have a dive watch and
this<00:01:18.420> one<00:01:18.570> is<00:01:18.659> water<00:01:18.869> resistant<00:01:19.500> to<00:01:19.979> 200

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
this one is water resistant to 200

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:23.899 
this one is water resistant to 200
meters<00:01:20.850> and<00:01:21.170> so<00:01:22.170> what<00:01:22.740> -<00:01:22.890> so<00:01:22.920> did<00:01:23.369> is<00:01:23.490> put<00:01:23.670> a<00:01:23.700> lot

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909 
meters and so what - so did is put a lot

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:25.820 
meters and so what - so did is put a lot
of<00:01:24.090> effort<00:01:24.600> into<00:01:24.840> the<00:01:24.960> engineering<00:01:25.409> of<00:01:25.710> the

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830 
of effort into the engineering of the

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:28.249 
of effort into the engineering of the
case<00:01:26.040> and<00:01:26.310> the<00:01:26.400> design<00:01:26.580> in<00:01:27.090> order<00:01:27.780> to<00:01:27.930> make<00:01:28.110> it

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:28.259 
case and the design in order to make it

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:30.020 
case and the design in order to make it
so<00:01:28.409> the<00:01:28.500> water<00:01:28.650> resistance<00:01:28.920> is<00:01:29.369> very<00:01:29.430> hot<00:01:29.790> at

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
so the water resistance is very hot at

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:32.450 
so the water resistance is very hot at
the<00:01:30.270> same<00:01:30.540> time<00:01:30.900> this<00:01:31.560> watch<00:01:31.890> has<00:01:32.130> some<00:01:32.280> really

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
the same time this watch has some really

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:35.390 
the same time this watch has some really
cool<00:01:32.729> features<00:01:33.210> that<00:01:33.680> make<00:01:34.680> it<00:01:34.710> so<00:01:35.070> that<00:01:35.100> when

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:35.400 
cool features that make it so that when

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:37.370 
cool features that make it so that when
you<00:01:35.549> are<00:01:35.579> in<00:01:35.790> dive<00:01:36.000> mode<00:01:36.390> some<00:01:36.930> use<00:01:37.170> that

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
you are in dive mode some use that

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:39.200 
you are in dive mode some use that
function<00:01:37.770> there<00:01:37.920> you<00:01:38.220> see<00:01:38.430> that<00:01:38.610> I<00:01:38.640> love<00:01:39.090> this

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210 
function there you see that I love this

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:39.560 
function there you see that I love this
thing

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570 
thing

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:41.590 
thing
that<00:01:39.900> when<00:01:40.049> you're<00:01:40.200> in<00:01:40.229> dive<00:01:40.530> mode<00:01:40.890> it

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:41.600 
that when you're in dive mode it

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:45.469 
that when you're in dive mode it
automatically<00:01:43.399> detects<00:01:44.399> that<00:01:44.549> and<00:01:44.970> starts<00:01:45.329> to

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:45.479 
automatically detects that and starts to

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:47.179 
automatically detects that and starts to
track<00:01:45.810> like<00:01:46.110> how<00:01:46.350> long<00:01:46.560> you're<00:01:46.829> underwater

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:47.189 
track like how long you're underwater

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:49.969 
track like how long you're underwater
how<00:01:47.939> deep<00:01:48.299> you<00:01:48.540> are<00:01:48.570> and<00:01:49.079> stuff<00:01:49.500> like<00:01:49.680> that<00:01:49.860> and

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
how deep you are and stuff like that and

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:52.789 
how deep you are and stuff like that and
then<00:01:50.070> go<00:01:50.280> to<00:01:50.340> the<00:01:50.490> log<00:01:50.700> section<00:01:51.090> here<00:01:51.600> and<00:01:51.799> I

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:52.799 
then go to the log section here and I

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:55.100 
then go to the log section here and I
haven't<00:01:53.280> done<00:01:53.430> any<00:01:53.670> dives<00:01:53.909> right<00:01:54.149> now<00:01:54.420> but

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:55.110 
haven't done any dives right now but

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:56.749 
haven't done any dives right now but
it'll<00:01:55.350> tell<00:01:55.649> you<00:01:55.860> we're<00:01:56.100> going<00:01:56.219> to<00:01:56.460> save<00:01:56.640> the

00:01:56.749 --> 00:01:56.759 
it'll tell you we're going to save the

00:01:56.759 --> 00:01:58.700 
it'll tell you we're going to save the
day<00:01:56.790> to<00:01:57.030> say<00:01:57.479> you<00:01:57.780> know<00:01:57.899> the<00:01:57.990> time<00:01:58.259> and<00:01:58.290> then

00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:58.710 
day to say you know the time and then

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:00.830 
day to say you know the time and then

chronograph and you'll you see it uses
the<00:02:06.689> LCD<00:02:07.110> screen<00:02:07.170> for<00:02:07.590> that<00:02:07.799> they<00:02:08.369> also<00:02:08.459> use

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:08.700 
the LCD screen for that they also use

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:10.520 
the LCD screen for that they also use
pins<00:02:08.910> also<00:02:09.060> backlit<00:02:09.690> by<00:02:09.840> holding<00:02:10.259> down<00:02:10.349> the

you can see that cool red yeah I love

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:19.369 
you can see that cool red yeah I love
that<00:02:16.590> that<00:02:16.860> cool<00:02:17.069> red<00:02:17.220> backlight<00:02:17.610> so<00:02:17.849> neat<00:02:18.379> the

00:02:19.369 --> 00:02:19.379 
that that cool red backlight so neat the

00:02:19.379 --> 00:02:22.190 
that that cool red backlight so neat the
stopwatch<00:02:19.650> like<00:02:20.010> you<00:02:20.129> see<00:02:20.370> the<00:02:20.970> alarm<00:02:21.390> the

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:22.200 
stopwatch like you see the alarm the

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:24.020 
stopwatch like you see the alarm the
compass<00:02:22.800> the<00:02:23.010> compass<00:02:23.099> is<00:02:23.520> always<00:02:23.760> the<00:02:23.879> best

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:24.030 
compass the compass is always the best

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:26.059 
compass the compass is always the best
one<00:02:24.180> I<00:02:24.300> love<00:02:24.840> the<00:02:24.989> compass<00:02:25.319> it's<00:02:25.500> such<00:02:25.650> a<00:02:25.680> cool

00:02:26.059 --> 00:02:26.069 
one I love the compass it's such a cool

00:02:26.069 --> 00:02:28.309 
one I love the compass it's such a cool
thing<00:02:26.099> and<00:02:26.670> so<00:02:27.209> you<00:02:27.300> see<00:02:27.450> the<00:02:27.599> hands<00:02:27.840> turn<00:02:28.110> into

00:02:28.309 --> 00:02:28.319 
thing and so you see the hands turn into

00:02:28.319 --> 00:02:30.350 
thing and so you see the hands turn into
like<00:02:28.410> the<00:02:28.560> compass<00:02:28.920> needle<00:02:28.950> and<00:02:29.489> they<00:02:29.970> see<00:02:30.209> the

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:30.360 
like the compass needle and they see the

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:33.020 
like the compass needle and they see the
degrees<00:02:31.080> there<00:02:31.470> in<00:02:31.680> the<00:02:31.800> screen<00:02:32.069> so<00:02:32.760> then<00:02:32.910> it

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:33.030 
degrees there in the screen so then it

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:34.460 
degrees there in the screen so then it
also<00:02:33.150> has<00:02:33.390> the<00:02:33.629> thermometer<00:02:34.260> another

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:34.470 
also has the thermometer another

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:36.559 
also has the thermometer another
thermometer<00:02:35.069> it's<00:02:35.190> a<00:02:35.280> 74<00:02:35.819> degrees<00:02:36.150> it<00:02:36.510> is

00:02:36.559 --> 00:02:36.569 
thermometer it's a 74 degrees it is

00:02:36.569 --> 00:02:38.420 
thermometer it's a 74 degrees it is
probably<00:02:37.080> about<00:02:37.170> 74<00:02:37.739> degrees<00:02:38.010> in<00:02:38.129> this<00:02:38.190> room

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:38.430 
probably about 74 degrees in this room

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:40.100 
probably about 74 degrees in this room
right<00:02:38.580> now<00:02:38.640> you<00:02:39.090> have<00:02:39.300> to<00:02:39.510> take<00:02:39.720> the<00:02:39.870> watch<00:02:40.080> off

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:40.110 
right now you have to take the watch off

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:42.920 
right now you have to take the watch off
your<00:02:40.739> wrist<00:02:41.010> for<00:02:41.879> the<00:02:41.910> thermometer<00:02:42.360> mode<00:02:42.780> the

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:42.930 
your wrist for the thermometer mode the

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:44.740 
your wrist for the thermometer mode the
reason<00:02:43.260> is<00:02:43.410> is<00:02:43.560> that<00:02:43.590> it's<00:02:43.830> going<00:02:44.010> to<00:02:44.099> take

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:44.750 
reason is is that it's going to take

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:47.390 
reason is is that it's going to take
temperature<00:02:45.750> from<00:02:46.410> your<00:02:46.590> body<00:02:46.830> heat<00:02:47.129> as<00:02:47.250> well

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:47.400 
temperature from your body heat as well

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:49.100 
temperature from your body heat as well
so<00:02:47.700> you<00:02:47.790> have<00:02:47.910> to<00:02:48.030> let<00:02:48.180> the<00:02:48.330> watch<00:02:48.480> get<00:02:48.780> to<00:02:48.900> room

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:49.110 
so you have to let the watch get to room

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:51.229 
so you have to let the watch get to room
temperature<00:02:49.680> or<00:02:49.950> wherever<00:02:50.280> you<00:02:50.430> are<00:02:50.459> in<00:02:51.000> order

00:02:51.229 --> 00:02:51.239 
temperature or wherever you are in order

00:02:51.239 --> 00:02:52.520 
temperature or wherever you are in order
to<00:02:51.330> take<00:02:51.450> an<00:02:51.599> accurate<00:02:51.810> readings<00:02:52.290> you<00:02:52.349> have<00:02:52.440> to

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:52.530 
to take an accurate readings you have to

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:54.440 
to take an accurate readings you have to
take<00:02:52.709> it<00:02:52.830> off<00:02:52.950> of<00:02:53.099> your<00:02:53.220> aunt<00:02:53.430> for<00:02:53.700> a<00:02:53.940> little

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:54.450 
take it off of your aunt for a little

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:56.390 
take it off of your aunt for a little
bit<00:02:54.599> and<00:02:54.780> then<00:02:55.319> you<00:02:55.650> know<00:02:55.769> it<00:02:55.890> has<00:02:56.069> all<00:02:56.250> the

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:56.400 
bit and then you know it has all the

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:58.490 
bit and then you know it has all the
other<00:02:56.519> basic<00:02:57.000> T<00:02:57.420> touch<00:02:57.599> features<00:02:58.110> what's

00:02:58.490 --> 00:02:58.500 
other basic T touch features what's

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:00.649 
other basic T touch features what's
missing<00:02:59.010> here<00:02:59.280> sort<00:02:59.879> of<00:02:59.970> you<00:03:00.390> know<00:03:00.420> as<00:03:00.629> a

00:03:00.649 --> 00:03:00.659 
missing here sort of you know as a

00:03:00.659 --> 00:03:02.479 
missing here sort of you know as a
trade-off<00:03:01.050> for<00:03:01.200> the<00:03:01.409> diving<00:03:01.620> functions<00:03:02.310> is

00:03:02.479 --> 00:03:02.489 
trade-off for the diving functions is

00:03:02.489 --> 00:03:07.640 
trade-off for the diving functions is
mostly<00:03:02.790> like<00:03:03.000> the<00:03:03.150> barometer<00:03:06.349> try<00:03:07.349> think<00:03:07.560> what

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:07.650 
mostly like the barometer try think what

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:10.130 
mostly like the barometer try think what
else<00:03:07.800> there<00:03:07.980> was<00:03:08.510> there's<00:03:09.510> the<00:03:09.629> barometer

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:10.140 
else there was there's the barometer

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:12.080 
else there was there's the barometer
there<00:03:10.560> was<00:03:10.739> maybe<00:03:11.099> a<00:03:11.190> countdown<00:03:11.580> time<00:03:11.909> or

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:12.090 
there was maybe a countdown time or

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:14.479 
there was maybe a countdown time or
something<00:03:12.330> like<00:03:12.420> that<00:03:12.680> but<00:03:13.680> I<00:03:13.860> think<00:03:13.980> you<00:03:14.310> know

00:03:14.479 --> 00:03:14.489 
something like that but I think you know

00:03:14.489 --> 00:03:17.869 
something like that but I think you know
as<00:03:14.700> a<00:03:14.760> watch<00:03:15.569> for<00:03:15.900> daily<00:03:16.290> use<00:03:16.560> it's<00:03:17.550> going<00:03:17.790> to

00:03:17.869 --> 00:03:17.879 
as a watch for daily use it's going to

00:03:17.879 --> 00:03:20.930 
as a watch for daily use it's going to
be<00:03:18.290> kind<00:03:19.290> of<00:03:19.470> limited<00:03:19.980> in<00:03:20.099> the<00:03:20.250> sense<00:03:20.430> that<00:03:20.730> you

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:20.940 
be kind of limited in the sense that you

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:23.390 
be kind of limited in the sense that you
don't<00:03:21.060> have<00:03:21.360> you<00:03:22.290> know<00:03:22.409> all<00:03:22.680> the<00:03:22.950> different

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:23.400 
don't have you know all the different

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:25.220 
don't have you know all the different
functions<00:03:24.090> available<00:03:24.360> to<00:03:24.720> you<00:03:24.840> like<00:03:25.080> the

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:25.230 
functions available to you like the

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:26.660 
functions available to you like the
Daiya<00:03:25.409> functions<00:03:25.920> you<00:03:26.010> have<00:03:26.220> to<00:03:26.370> be<00:03:26.489> under

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:26.670 
Daiya functions you have to be under

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:29.390 
Daiya functions you have to be under
water<00:03:26.870> but<00:03:27.870> the<00:03:28.140> compass<00:03:28.530> function<00:03:28.950> the<00:03:29.069> alarm

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:29.400 
water but the compass function the alarm

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:32.360 
water but the compass function the alarm
the<00:03:29.970> chronograph<00:03:30.540> you<00:03:30.930> know<00:03:31.049> the<00:03:31.170> date<00:03:31.440> all

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:32.370 
the chronograph you know the date all

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:35.479 
the chronograph you know the date all
that<00:03:32.430> stuff<00:03:32.879> is<00:03:33.030> perfectly<00:03:33.629> useful<00:03:34.290> so<00:03:34.769> even

00:03:35.479 --> 00:03:35.489 
that stuff is perfectly useful so even

00:03:35.489 --> 00:03:36.830 
that stuff is perfectly useful so even
though<00:03:35.610> I'm<00:03:35.760> someone<00:03:36.180> that<00:03:36.209> you<00:03:36.540> know<00:03:36.659> isn't

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:36.840 
though I'm someone that you know isn't

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:39.259 
though I'm someone that you know isn't
like<00:03:37.110> a<00:03:37.140> big<00:03:37.260> diver<00:03:37.620> you<00:03:37.830> know<00:03:38.099> I<00:03:38.129> should<00:03:38.580> spend

00:03:39.259 --> 00:03:39.269 
like a big diver you know I should spend

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:51.180 
watches are steel but the T touch

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:53.149 
watches are steel but the T touch
collection<00:03:51.750> there<00:03:52.200> are<00:03:52.230> steel<00:03:52.620> ones<00:03:52.860> but<00:03:53.040> they

00:03:53.149 --> 00:03:53.159 
collection there are steel ones but they

00:03:53.159 --> 00:03:55.970 
collection there are steel ones but they
tend<00:03:53.430> to<00:03:53.459> prefer<00:03:53.670> titanium<00:03:54.510> is<00:03:55.439> titanium

tend to prefer titanium is titanium

00:03:55.980 --> 00:03:58.520 
tend to prefer titanium is titanium
better<00:03:56.370> than<00:03:56.610> steel<00:03:56.909> it's<00:03:57.510> harder<00:03:58.049> it's<00:03:58.379> going

00:03:58.520 --> 00:03:58.530 
better than steel it's harder it's going

00:03:58.530 --> 00:03:59.960 
better than steel it's harder it's going
to<00:03:58.590> scratch<00:03:58.890> a<00:03:59.010> little<00:03:59.159> bit<00:03:59.310> easier<00:03:59.640> it's<00:03:59.819> not

that the hands are easy to see it's got
a<00:04:11.849> cool<00:04:12.150> looking<00:04:12.420> dial<00:04:12.689> there's<00:04:13.590> a<00:04:13.650> lot<00:04:13.860> of

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:14.010 
a cool looking dial there's a lot of

00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:15.619 
a cool looking dial there's a lot of
luminance<00:04:14.459> here<00:04:14.700> actress<00:04:15.000> so<00:04:15.120> the<00:04:15.209> hands<00:04:15.540> are

00:04:15.619 --> 00:04:15.629 
luminance here actress so the hands are

00:04:15.629 --> 00:04:17.300 
luminance here actress so the hands are
illuminated<00:04:16.109> the<00:04:16.169> hour<00:04:16.290> markers<00:04:16.709> illuminated

00:04:17.300 --> 00:04:17.310 
illuminated the hour markers illuminated

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:18.710 
illuminated the hour markers illuminated
part<00:04:17.820> of<00:04:17.940> this<00:04:18.000> bezel<00:04:18.269> here

00:04:18.710 --> 00:04:18.720 
part of this bezel here

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:20.750 
part of this bezel here
is<00:04:18.780> illuminated<00:04:19.350> the<00:04:19.680> bezel<00:04:20.040> does<00:04:20.190> not<00:04:20.370> turn

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:20.760 
is illuminated the bezel does not turn

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:23.630 
is illuminated the bezel does not turn
it's<00:04:21.630> a<00:04:21.660> little<00:04:21.959> bit<00:04:22.110> of<00:04:22.200> a<00:04:22.260> drawback<00:04:22.640> but

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:23.640 
it's a little bit of a drawback but

00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:25.550 
it's a little bit of a drawback but
having<00:04:24.330> said<00:04:24.570> that<00:04:24.630> it<00:04:25.050> does<00:04:25.260> have<00:04:25.530> a

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:25.560 
having said that it does have a

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:28.490 
having said that it does have a
dedicated<00:04:26.160> chronograph<00:04:27.090> function<00:04:27.510> so<00:04:27.780> that's

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:28.500 
dedicated chronograph function so that's

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:31.310 
dedicated chronograph function so that's
basically<00:04:28.890> the<00:04:29.010> bezels<00:04:29.430> for<00:04:29.700> so<00:04:30.120> it<00:04:30.750> does<00:04:31.080> like

00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:31.320 
basically the bezels for so it does like

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:32.750 
basically the bezels for so it does like
I<00:04:31.440> said<00:04:31.620> it<00:04:31.740> doesn't<00:04:31.920> have<00:04:32.130> a<00:04:32.190> traditional

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:32.760 
I said it doesn't have a traditional

00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:34.910 
I said it doesn't have a traditional
rotating<00:04:33.300> diver's<00:04:33.690> bezel<00:04:34.080> but<00:04:34.380> it<00:04:34.530> does<00:04:34.710> have

00:04:34.910 --> 00:04:34.920 
rotating diver's bezel but it does have

00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:36.560 
rotating diver's bezel but it does have
other<00:04:35.130> features<00:04:35.490> that<00:04:35.880> sort<00:04:36.090> of<00:04:36.120> make<00:04:36.360> up<00:04:36.540> for

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:36.570 
other features that sort of make up for

00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:38.660 
other features that sort of make up for
that<00:04:36.780> the<00:04:37.290> design<00:04:37.680> of<00:04:37.860> this<00:04:37.980> watch<00:04:38.190> was<00:04:38.400> really

00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:38.670 
that the design of this watch was really

00:04:38.670 --> 00:04:40.970 
that the design of this watch was really
really<00:04:38.850> cool<00:04:39.150> and<00:04:39.630> there's<00:04:40.470> a<00:04:40.530> lots<00:04:40.680> of<00:04:40.800> little

00:04:40.970 --> 00:04:40.980 
really cool and there's a lots of little

00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:42.440 
really cool and there's a lots of little
features<00:04:41.340> one<00:04:41.490> of<00:04:41.520> the<00:04:41.610> best<00:04:41.940> parts<00:04:42.180> I<00:04:42.240> like<00:04:42.360> if

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:42.450 
features one of the best parts I like if

00:04:42.450 --> 00:04:43.400 
features one of the best parts I like if
you<00:04:42.510> look<00:04:42.660> at<00:04:42.780> the<00:04:42.870> side<00:04:43.080> here<00:04:43.290> with<00:04:43.380> the

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:43.410 
you look at the side here with the

00:04:43.410 --> 00:04:45.170 
you look at the side here with the
pushers<00:04:43.860> that's<00:04:44.370> like<00:04:44.610> the<00:04:44.730> pushers<00:04:45.090> are

00:04:45.170 --> 00:04:45.180 
pushers that's like the pushers are

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:47.240 
pushers that's like the pushers are
actually<00:04:45.540> coated<00:04:45.780> there's<00:04:46.710> sort<00:04:46.860> of<00:04:46.920> a<00:04:47.010> rubber

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:47.250 
actually coated there's sort of a rubber

00:04:47.250 --> 00:04:48.950 
actually coated there's sort of a rubber
cap<00:04:47.580> on<00:04:47.820> them<00:04:48.030> and<00:04:48.210> that's<00:04:48.270> for<00:04:48.690> the<00:04:48.780> water

00:04:48.950 --> 00:04:48.960 
cap on them and that's for the water

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:50.630 
cap on them and that's for the water
resistance<00:04:49.590> so<00:04:49.710> you<00:04:49.740> can<00:04:49.980> use<00:04:50.160> the<00:04:50.310> pushers

00:04:50.630 --> 00:04:50.640 
resistance so you can use the pushers

00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:52.340 
resistance so you can use the pushers
underwater<00:04:51.090> and<00:04:51.360> there's<00:04:51.750> some<00:04:51.930> interesting

00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:52.350 
underwater and there's some interesting

00:04:52.350 --> 00:04:54.020 
underwater and there's some interesting
detail<00:04:52.710> right<00:04:52.890> here<00:04:52.950> these<00:04:53.550> little<00:04:53.790> holes

00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:54.030 
detail right here these little holes

00:04:54.030 --> 00:04:57.410 
detail right here these little holes
right<00:04:54.240> here<00:04:54.300> that's<00:04:55.050> where<00:04:55.380> water<00:04:55.820> enters<00:04:56.820> the

00:04:57.410 --> 00:04:57.420 
right here that's where water enters the

00:04:57.420 --> 00:04:59.210 
right here that's where water enters the
watch<00:04:57.630> for<00:04:57.930> that<00:04:57.990> pressure<00:04:58.290> system<00:04:58.860> there's

00:04:59.210 --> 00:04:59.220 
watch for that pressure system there's

00:04:59.220 --> 00:05:00.800 
watch for that pressure system there's
little<00:04:59.460> gaps<00:04:59.880> around<00:05:00.240> here<00:05:00.390> where<00:05:00.510> water<00:05:00.690> is

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:00.810 
little gaps around here where water is

00:05:00.810 --> 00:05:02.510 
little gaps around here where water is
entered<00:05:01.170> and<00:05:01.320> there's<00:05:01.650> sensors<00:05:02.010> in<00:05:02.190> there<00:05:02.340> so

00:05:02.510 --> 00:05:02.520 
entered and there's sensors in there so

00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:03.890 
entered and there's sensors in there so
that<00:05:02.550> the<00:05:02.910> watch<00:05:03.060> knows<00:05:03.330> how<00:05:03.510> deep<00:05:03.720> you're

00:05:03.890 --> 00:05:03.900 
that the watch knows how deep you're

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:06.230 
that the watch knows how deep you're
going<00:05:04.200> overall<00:05:05.070> this<00:05:05.460> is<00:05:05.520> a<00:05:05.670> really<00:05:05.760> really

00:05:06.230 --> 00:05:06.240 
going overall this is a really really

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:08.480 
going overall this is a really really
great<00:05:06.390> piece<00:05:06.780> that<00:05:07.020> came<00:05:07.230> out<00:05:07.410> last<00:05:07.920> year<00:05:08.190> this

00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:08.490 
great piece that came out last year this
