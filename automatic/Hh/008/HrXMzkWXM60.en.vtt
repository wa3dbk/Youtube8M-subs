00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200 
number one number one is the fact that

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:58.070 
number one number one is the fact that
it's<00:01:55.470> as<00:01:55.700> wide<00:01:56.700> as<00:01:57.090> a<00:01:57.119> heavy-duty<00:01:57.450> truck

it's as wide as a heavy-duty truck
it<00:01:58.319> makes<00:01:58.560> parking<00:01:58.890> it<00:01:59.130> well<00:01:59.549> somewhat

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.000 
it makes parking it well somewhat

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.419 
it makes parking it well somewhat
challenging<00:02:00.630> and<00:02:00.810> it<00:02:01.289> makes<00:02:01.500> maneuvering<00:02:02.310> it

00:02:02.419 --> 00:02:02.429 
challenging and it makes maneuvering it

00:02:02.429 --> 00:02:04.429 
challenging and it makes maneuvering it
more<00:02:02.640> importantly<00:02:03.119> off-road<00:02:03.720> even<00:02:04.140> harder

it's<00:02:04.590> just<00:02:04.860> really<00:02:05.549> big<00:02:05.849> now<00:02:06.720> in<00:02:06.959> the<00:02:07.049> year<00:02:07.170> and

00:02:07.249 --> 00:02:07.259 
it's just really big now in the year and

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:09.620 
it's just really big now in the year and
a<00:02:07.349> half<00:02:07.470> that<00:02:07.560> we've<00:02:07.709> had<00:02:07.890> the<00:02:08.039> Raptor<00:02:08.630> driven

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:11.479 
a half that we've had the Raptor driven
a<00:02:09.720> lot<00:02:09.899> think<00:02:10.170> about<00:02:10.380> the<00:02:10.470> fact<00:02:10.679> that<00:02:10.799> we<00:02:11.069> have

00:02:11.479 --> 00:02:11.489 
a lot think about the fact that we have

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:13.880 
a lot think about the fact that we have
a<00:02:11.880> fleet<00:02:12.660> of<00:02:12.690> cars<00:02:12.810> and<00:02:13.260> trucks<00:02:13.350> that<00:02:13.739> we<00:02:13.859> can

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:13.890 
a fleet of cars and trucks that we can

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:16.880 
a fleet of cars and trucks that we can
drive<00:02:14.220> and<00:02:14.489> yet<00:02:14.700> we've<00:02:15.269> put<00:02:15.480> on<00:02:15.569> over<00:02:15.989> 26,000

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:16.890 
drive and yet we've put on over 26,000

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:19.550 
drive and yet we've put on over 26,000
miles<00:02:17.069> and<00:02:17.430> in<00:02:17.819> that<00:02:18.030> time<00:02:18.329> we've<00:02:19.109> changed<00:02:19.410> the

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:19.560 
miles and in that time we've changed the

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:21.530 
miles and in that time we've changed the
oil<00:02:19.620> every<00:02:20.160> 5,000<00:02:20.880> miles<00:02:21.060> and<00:02:21.269> we've<00:02:21.359> rotated

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:21.540 
oil every 5,000 miles and we've rotated

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:24.199

change<00:02:24.540> has<00:02:24.780> been<00:02:24.930> about<00:02:25.100> $87<00:02:26.100> so<00:02:26.609> cost<00:02:26.940> of

00:02:27.229 --> 00:02:27.239 
change has been about $87 so cost of
