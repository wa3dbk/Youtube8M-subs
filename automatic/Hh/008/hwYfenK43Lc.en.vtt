00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:33.470

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:35.570
 comedy there are many looks and there are also 

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:37.670
 looks as to where my debut in the 

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:42.130
 long then I guess there's always a 

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:42.130
 certain expectation from to see how 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:51.720

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:57.120
 first time of three of the protagonists 

00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:58.559
 is the let's say it's his first movie and 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:59.970
 also in my first movie will always be 

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:02.070
 our first movie and that unites us a lot 

00:00:59.970 --> 00:01:04.559
 to work with manuel ah bueno 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:06.990
 Manuela is a character Manuel is a 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:10.770
 character and it shows not when it comes to shooting 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:12.960
 we probably sneak some that is 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:15.240
 a love is pure love they carry a smell 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:17.490
 As filming progressed, 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:19.619
 has been taking more and more love and is 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:22.590
 as it is very funny because when 

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:24.600
 when the sequence ends and you listen 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:26.580
 from combo scream wonderful 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:29.390
 wonderful is that everything went well and 

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:29.390
 that there is no other plane 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:35.009
 We cut wonderful very well very well 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:36.509
 If you have done something right, you will not 

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:38.399
 worry that you will find out because I 

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:42.320
 it's shorter than good to say cut and it's going to 

00:01:38.399 --> 00:01:42.320
 shout wonderful manuela 

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:51.630
 everything is great 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:54.329
 and it shows so much that he loves or that he has 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:58.310
 passion to what is doing that I 

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:58.310
 I think that is the key 

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:04.530
 I think I'll be lucky in the 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:06.179
 future to say that I was in the 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:09.530
