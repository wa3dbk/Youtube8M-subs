00:00:01.240 --> 00:00:07.359
 Yes that's why you act 

00:00:04.300 --> 00:00:10.290
 I would like to do a drum piano course 

00:00:07.359 --> 00:00:13.019
 First, the most basic 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:15.390
 I 'll try c 

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:18.830
 The action c 

00:00:15.390 --> 00:00:24.820
 Right hand transport 

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:24.820
 On the left, hold the root lowest throat 

00:00:28.290 --> 00:00:34.630
 me 

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:36.920
 The left hand is gorgeous or 

00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:41.829
 Or both 

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:41.829
 Even this fine c is closed 

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:50.850
 I think that some people have heard the word "expanded form" 

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:54.210
 And say what it 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:56.560
 Or or draw a bright Zhuang 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:01:01.260
 Akiraso. 

00:00:56.560 --> 00:01:04.470
 And or or riot eyes caught 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:05.430
 - This expansions Well 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:08.219
 me 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:12.850
 Just change the order 

00:01:08.219 --> 00:01:15.460
 The composition is the same, even if you play the same dish 

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:18.470
 There is no change in the action c 

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:20.440
 Let's play it. 

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:23.160
 ni 

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:23.160
 me 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:27.570
 am 

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:27.570
 Yeah yeah yeah 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:36.689
 But there is a word called action progression pattern is 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:39.050
 Change from one code to the next 

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:45.770
 It means that you are going forward 

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:47.890
 For example, let's say that the action of f is pulled from the code of c. The action of f 

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:47.890
 Is 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:50.600
 re 

00:01:53.060 --> 00:02:00.070
 This is the basic form, so the left hand holds the lowest sound fur 

00:02:00.439 --> 00:02:08.200
 To 

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:11.480
 For example, if there was a code change called f from c 

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:14.230
 If you call me how to draw 

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:14.230
 me 

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:19.210
 From here f 2 e 

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:22.000
 f 

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:31.090
 It becomes a way of playing like crap 

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:34.460
 What if you go to f, for example, first, starting with the first in the form Gado Democratic Party and the basic form of the c 

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:39.140
 Please consider that the say or suppress 

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:40.090
 I 'm going to go from here because this farad called f 

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:42.660
 Hmm 

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:42.660
 If this 

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:54.080
 Movement back harmony to Noto to become more wasteful movement a little chopped chopped 

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:54.750
 Because the flow like this is not smooth 

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:57.980
 From 

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:57.980
 Mostly when going 

00:02:58.550 --> 00:03:02.080
 Arato 

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:11.010
 I'm free, but I'm here separately 

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:11.010
 Of course not necessarily I must do this 

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:24.209
 If the sound of the dub that is covered as a bone is just as it is that law 

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:24.209
 I think it would be easy to understand if you remember it 

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:30.780
 Alliance likely 

00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:34.070
 Def is how it is Farer, so this sounds the same so this 

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:34.070
 It is said that this is left 

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:38.340
 It looks like this 

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:42.890
 eh 

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:42.890
 For example, the action of c is 

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:48.550
 If you are holding in the form of 3 Sword 

00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:49.880
 Hmm 

00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:54.370
 No 

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:54.370
 How can you play f is the code 

00:03:55.620 --> 00:04:00.140
 Yes it is for example 

00:03:57.440 --> 00:04:02.780
 This is eh 

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:05.870
 Which sound is wearing 

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:08.140
 This was as it is this finger is left as it is 

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:08.140
 f 

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:14.080
 If you can play smoothly with 9 

00:04:14.210 --> 00:04:16.840
 Finally 

00:04:17.170 --> 00:04:21.519
 If you go to the action of Sodo 3 to f 

00:04:20.350 --> 00:04:27.330
 eh 

00:04:21.519 --> 00:04:27.330
 It is important to think about this by yourself 

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:30.660
 Door, for example, Jer 

00:04:30.670 --> 00:04:36.150
 am 

00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:42.510
 It will be connected smoothly 

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:45.290
 Finally we end by subtracting code progression from a c to f 

00:04:42.510 --> 00:04:45.290
 ni 

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:51.720
 DEA 

00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:59.160
 Please try to be drawn Yes Why everyone
