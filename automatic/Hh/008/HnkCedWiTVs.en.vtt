00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:10.520
Retinol is a powerful anti-aging agent of key importance in cosmetics.

00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:15.280
It has low solubility and is easily degradable in contact with oxygen and light,

00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:21.180
and has thus been the object of continued research seeking to optimize its efficacy.

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:35.920
Since 1999, Sesderma has tried to overcome this instability through innovative formulations

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:42.800
and packaging. Ten years later, in 2009, we managed to encapsulate retinol in lipid bubbles,

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:45.800
ensuring its stability and tolerance.

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:54.560
In 2014, Sesderma patented the tri-retinol system, which would become the basis for its new cosmetic lines.

00:00:55.780 --> 00:01:00.880
Reti Age. A blast of vitamin A that repairs without irritation.

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:13.320
Reti Age combines 3 kinds of retinoids encapsulated in lipid bubbles that have numerous benefits for your skin.

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:19.180
Lipid bubbles allow for the sustained release of retinoids and thus each molecule has a more gradual rate of action.

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:24.600
Actives reach therapeutic levels for longer periods of time, improving skin tolerance.

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:33.580
Skin retinization is thus accomplished, establishing a constant retinol deposit which is activated as needed.

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:50.500
Thereafter, through induction therapy, retinoids stimulate the growth factors

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:54.260
responsible for regeneration and anti-wrinkle action.

00:01:54.600 --> 00:02:01.220
The epidermic growth factor (EGF) acts on the epidermis, stimulating skin regeneration

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:03.560
and achieving higher cutaneous density.

00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:15.380
The transforming growth factor beta (TGF-Î²) acts on the dermis.

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:22.960
Fibroblast stimulation increases collagen production levels and, consequently, gives firmness to the skin.

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:38.600
Liposomes are partly made up of fatty acids which restore the stratum corneum and the defense mechanisms of the skin,

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:45.240
improving its barrier function and reducing secondary effects such as dryness, redness and flaking.

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:55.960
Also, retinol controls hyperactivity of melanocytes, the cells in charge of pigment synthesis

00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:59.360
that color the skin, reducing the appearance of skin spots.

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:08.900
This powerful anti-aging action is combined with other active ingredients such as hyaluronic acid

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:14.340
and growth factors, which act synergistically with the 3-retinol system.

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:22.880
A balanced formula; our new milestone:

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:28.780
RETI AGE
The blast of vitamin A that repairs without irritation.
