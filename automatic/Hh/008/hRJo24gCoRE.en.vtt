00:00:00.770 --> 00:00:09.059
 some people are praying for the deceased 

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:11.000
 God has a good word for you 

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:14.009
 appeal 

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:19.500
 yes what is actually in the Bible 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:20.039
 nothing about prayers for deceased 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:22.890
 Nothing 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:26.880
 we will not put in any one 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:31.080
 the bible asked for the deceased 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:34.469
 We can now pray through 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:37.290
 our prayers for our deceased 

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:39.780
 God reach you in the sky 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:43.649
 yes, the bible says that we are 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:46.879
 can not do this because we are in 

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:48.469
 this life for jesus christ 

00:00:46.879 --> 00:00:51.870
 can decide 

00:00:48.469 --> 00:00:54.239
 and because this decision is for Jesus in 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:58.469
 this life you live in now 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:01:04.260
 must be taken is and because 

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:07.530
 there is only one single life 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:10.610
 and you can read it yourself 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:15.060
 and how it is intended for humans 

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:15.890
 once to die after that but that 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:18.210
 dish 

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:20.880
 you can still offer so much for 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:22.470
 deceased becomes his fate 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:26.400
 do not change anything 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:30.540
 in the preacher stands at the place where the tree 

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:30.930
 falls there he remains pumps from the 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:34.619
 mouse 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:38.280
 So the decision where to go after that 

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:43.590
 death is taken by herself 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:46.950
 every single one you can not put anyone in the 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:50.700
 sky offerers let alone in the 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:53.100
 sky preach as it does quite often 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:55.560
 funerals, for example, is the case 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:58.260
 You can not see anyone in the sky 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:02:01.600
 preach the here to times of life 

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:03.070
 yes a life was not lead with god 

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:05.320
 who made his decision 

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:08.500
 no i do not want my life with jesus 

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:11.370
 you can not know after that 

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:16.210
 just preach death in the sky 

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:19.960
 that is a lie a lie a dead one 

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:22.780
 is a dead man when he lives with god 

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:24.490
 has been saved yes if he is 

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:26.140
 that did not lead with god and me 

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:29.170
 wanted to get lost 

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:32.920
 it is very dangerous if so contact 

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:35.140
 with dead ones even pick that up 

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:37.690
 yes, some of them are really 

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:40.120
 dangerous and that is god too 

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:41.950
 greul if these things do that you can 

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:47.230
 Read it yourself in the fifth 

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:50.680
 book mose chapter 18 verses 11 to 12 and 

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:54.310
 it continues from verse 13 

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:58.300
 God wants you to be undivided 

00:02:54.310 --> 00:03:01.480
 you know him if you call good 

00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:05.140
 and then contact to kill 

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:08.080
 Do you make door and gate for the devil and 

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:10.989
 I'll tell you who does not bring you good ones 

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:12.400
 things through this door god 

00:03:10.989 --> 00:03:16.299
 however, already 

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:21.090
 God did not give you any good 

00:03:16.299 --> 00:03:24.340
