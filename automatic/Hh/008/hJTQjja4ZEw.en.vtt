00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:13.910
 there was once a lady leg that put 

00:00:11.090 --> 00:00:16.460
 many eggs however the egg 

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:18.830
 different continued without opening until 

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:21.110
 finally broke the duck 

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:23.539
 newborn had much more head 

00:00:21.110 --> 00:00:25.310
 big and his feathers were completely 

00:00:23.539 --> 00:00:27.800
 white 

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:30.500
 the ducklings went out to walk next to 

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:32.299
 the lady leg followed by the clumsy 

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:35.240
 Ugly duckling

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:39.830
 when they reached the shore they started 

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:42.470
 emit screams of joy when you see the water 

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:44.840
 for the first time the ugly duckling 'seeing 

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:47.840
 his brothers so happy decided 

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:50.960
 invite them but their sound was different 

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:53.830
 all the ducklings looked at each other 

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:56.330
 and the ugly duckling recoiled fearful 

00:00:53.830 --> 00:00:59.690
 sitting in the middle of the forest watched him move away 

00:00:56.330 --> 00:01:02.359
 his family swimming by the river 

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:04.489
 the night had come to the forest and the 

00:01:02.359 --> 00:01:07.580
 ugly duckling 'was still waiting for his 

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:10.159
 family started to rain and the duckling was 

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:13.270
 burst into tears because he knew that never again 

00:01:10.159 --> 00:01:15.880
 I would see your brothers again 

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:17.799
 the next morning the ugly duckling ' 

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:20.950
 He left in search of a family that 

00:01:17.799 --> 00:01:23.560
 it was like he toured many places 

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:26.679
 until you reach the most beautiful landscape that 

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:29.439
 I had never seen in the lagoon I swam in 

00:01:26.679 --> 00:01:31.689
 some majestic birds and the ducklings that 

00:01:29.439 --> 00:01:33.869
 they were following the lady swan they were just like 

00:01:31.689 --> 00:01:33.869
 the 

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:38.800
 without thinking twice the ugly duckling will 

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:41.860
 got in the pond swimming up 

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:43.860
 reach them and that's how the duckling 

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:47.550
 ugly 'found his true family 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:47.550
 living happily ever after 

00:01:49.880 --> 00:02:13.759
