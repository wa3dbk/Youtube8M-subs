00:00:01.420 --> 00:00:05.860
 hello to everyone I'm winder and in 

00:00:03.819 --> 00:00:08.049
 this video about devil 3 I'm going to 

00:00:05.860 --> 00:00:10.780
 show the additions of the edition of 

00:00:08.049 --> 00:00:12.040
 collector for all those who do not 

00:00:10.780 --> 00:00:14.110
 you have the collector's edition and 

00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:16.660
 you are curious about what are the 

00:00:14.110 --> 00:00:18.610
 extras that is assumed within the game to have 

00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:20.270
 the collector's edition then I'll 

00:00:18.610 --> 00:00:22.940
 let's show 

00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:24.620
 of course apart from the extra content 

00:00:22.940 --> 00:00:27.860
 that comes in the box as an art book 

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:30.530
 the soundtrack also etc. 

00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:33.200
 collector 's edition involves some 

00:00:30.530 --> 00:00:36.320
 new avatars for starcraft 2 also 

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:38.629
 supposes a mascot for world of 

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:41.239
 warcraft and here we will see what it is that 

00:00:38.629 --> 00:00:43.420
 are the extras that he brings for his own 

00:00:41.239 --> 00:00:47.260
 Devil game 3 

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:49.120
 the extras are these three objects worth 

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:50.409
 these objects are two dyes 

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:53.079
 called bottled cloud which is a 

00:00:50.409 --> 00:00:55.809
 white dye and bottled smoke 

00:00:53.079 --> 00:00:57.429
 which is a black color red these two 

00:00:55.809 --> 00:00:59.140
 dyes the main characteristic that 

00:00:57.429 --> 00:01:00.789
 they have is apart from that every time 

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:03.510
 create a new character this character 

00:01:00.789 --> 00:01:06.689
 comes with them already in the inventory 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:09.600
 they are infinite dyes that is their main 

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:12.000
 characteristic normally if we 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:13.560
 we buy a dye a seller 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:17.190
 For example, this seller bought it 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:19.320
 the spring tint 

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:21.660
 Well, if we have an object with 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:24.690
 the spring dye for example let's 

00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:26.790
 dye the helmet you see has been dyed 

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:28.080
 green and the dye disappears well 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:29.430
 The main characteristic of 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:31.230
 dyes the collector's edition is 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:33.920
 that are infinite worth is a dye of 

00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:35.509
 white color and one black color 

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:37.970
 and I think the two have an equivalent 

00:01:35.509 --> 00:01:39.680
 in the game that is not dyes 

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:42.860
 exclusive from the point of view of 

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:44.509
 color but the white dye the dye 

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:45.770
 white you can find it also in 

00:01:44.509 --> 00:01:46.960
 sellers just like the dye 

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:48.670
 black 

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:51.300
 I do not know exactly black if you are 

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:53.430
 fixing a kind of gray 

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:56.790
 for example let's see here I think that 

00:01:53.430 --> 00:02:00.240
 this seller has the white dye 

00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:04.070
 winter dye ok let's dye it with the 

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:04.070
 winter red the helmet 

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:08.429
 and now let's have it with the cloud 

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:10.170
 bottled up 

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:12.180
 if it is slightly different it is not the 

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:13.829
 same in this case but well I think that 

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:17.150
 are available anyway by 

00:02:13.829 --> 00:02:18.799
 there and this is the 

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:21.260
 the main characteristic of these 

00:02:18.799 --> 00:02:23.329
 teeth that are infinite then good 

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:26.860
 Well, if you really like your character 

00:02:23.329 --> 00:02:26.860
 go completely blank completely 

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:32.040
 in black because these 200 are infinite and 

00:02:30.209 --> 00:02:33.629
 they come with each character when when 

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:36.030
 you create them you can keep the stash 

00:02:33.629 --> 00:02:38.610
 you want and the second added are the 

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:40.500
 angelic rooms these rooms as they are 

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:43.400
 some rooms that has an effect similar to 

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:43.400
 those of the angels 

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:49.859
 OK and they are an activated object 

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:51.209
 disabled 

00:02:49.859 --> 00:02:53.879
 it's worth we have it in the 

00:02:51.209 --> 00:02:56.760
 inventory and when we activate it then the 

00:02:53.879 --> 00:02:58.829
 object is still in the inventory and we 

00:02:56.760 --> 00:03:00.480
 we have the wings are not removed right to 

00:02:58.829 --> 00:03:02.069
 time are simply removed when 

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:04.319
 us see deactivate the 

00:03:02.069 --> 00:03:06.870
 object to show the object and it 

00:03:04.319 --> 00:03:10.319
 deactivate good this is this yes it is 

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:13.580
 a more apparent visual detail than 

00:03:10.319 --> 00:03:16.280
 the teeth and maybe a 

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:17.150
 and a clearer identity stamp for 

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:20.440
 the people who have edition of 

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:22.630
 collector can be a curiosity 

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:25.000
 of course they are added that not 

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:25.870
 they pose no advantage in front of people 

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:28.180
 that does not have the edition of 

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:31.630
 collectors are merely added 

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:33.610
 aesthetic and that's all as last 

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:36.670
 added we can say that the edition 

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:38.860
 collector having it here is a 

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:41.110
 feat of strength that is good taste and 

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:45.700
 is provided with strength add a stealth 

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:48.040
 more to configure your banner 

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:50.140
 so these are basically all the 

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:53.140
 additions that the edition of 

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:55.150
 collector properly ingame apart 

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:56.830
 of what I can bring in starcraft in 

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:59.110
 world of warcraft or own content 

00:03:56.830 --> 00:04:01.030
 from that of the collector's edition 

00:03:59.110 --> 00:04:03.640
 this is this is what you will find if 

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:05.080
 you have the collector's edition so 

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:06.790

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:10.360

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:13.180
