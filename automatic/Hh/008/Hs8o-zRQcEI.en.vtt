00:00:26.289 --> 00:00:30.970
 hello youtube people welcome to a 

00:00:28.779 --> 00:00:33.219
 new tutorial of this your project channel 

00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:35.410
 techno this time I will present you a 

00:00:33.219 --> 00:00:37.269
 way to create a usb boot cable auto 

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:39.519
 bootable or also called pendrive 

00:00:37.269 --> 00:00:41.980
 without downloading any program we will use 

00:00:39.519 --> 00:00:43.899
 the ms 2 or also called symbol of 

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:45.879
 system that will serve us to record 

00:00:43.899 --> 00:00:47.409
 any iso image or disk image 

00:00:45.879 --> 00:00:49.780
 to install any system 

00:00:47.409 --> 00:00:54.129
 our computer operating either 

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:56.680
 windows 8 7 xp or linux and so on 

00:00:54.129 --> 00:00:58.720
 let's start the first thing we have to 

00:00:56.680 --> 00:01:00.610
 to do is to have the iso or image file 

00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:02.739
 disk previously downloaded and 

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:04.839
 mount it in a virtual drive using 

00:01:02.739 --> 00:01:06.580
 daemon tools if they do not have it download 

00:01:04.839 --> 00:01:08.680
 what and install what there is a version 

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:12.750
 free on the internet we will do what 

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:12.750
 next we enter the tools damon 

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:20.600
 we click on this icon to create a 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.600
 virtual unit 

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.470
 Right click and ride 

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:32.790
 we select the iso file and open 

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:40.090
 and we will already have mounted in a unit 

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:43.530
 virtual our operating system for 

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:43.530
 verify it we will go to team 

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:50.180
 and as you see here, the unit appears 

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:51.860
 mounted virtual that is as if 

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:54.950
 we would have inserted a disk of 

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:58.039
 installation of windows 

00:01:54.950 --> 00:02:02.590
 the next step will be to open the ms 2 us 

00:01:58.039 --> 00:02:02.590
 we go to the start menu we type cmd 

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:09.330
 we type the following disparate code 

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:09.330
 we give enter 

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:21.340
 we will write the command list disc 

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:26.350
 will show us the discs of 

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:27.040
 storage connected to the 

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:28.960
 computer 

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:30.760
 obviously we will choose the one of minor 

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:33.160
 capacity that is going to be our memory 

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:35.440
 usb before we have to be clear about the 

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:37.210
 capacity of our usb memory since 

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:39.460
 if we choose the hard drive by mistake 

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:41.350
 we can erase the operating system from 

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:43.900
 our computer in my case my 

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:47.140
 USB memory is 4 gigs then 

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:48.610
 choose disk 1 before doing this 

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:50.650
 they have to take into account that the 

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:54.870
 memory will be formatted so it 

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:54.870
 will erase all the files it contains 

00:02:55.550 --> 00:03:00.569
 we will write the following select and if the 

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:02.959
 number of your disk in my case is 1 and 

00:03:00.569 --> 00:03:02.959
 enter 

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:09.340
 then we type clear 

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:17.760
 now we write partition creates 

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:17.760
 primary 

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:30.020
 then we press select partition 1 

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:40.530
 activate 

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:48.530
 the next command is equal tfsi form 

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:48.530
 fat32 

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:05.260
 we type like this 

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:14.420
 we will appear this window we close it and 

00:04:11.099 --> 00:04:14.420
 now we write exit 

00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:19.480
 Now we will do the following in our 

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:22.350
 ms-dos window write the 

00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:22.350
 next code 

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:30.000
 scott and space immediately the letter of the 

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:31.770
 virtual drive where the 

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:35.090
 operating system that we want to record 

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:35.090
 we will go to team 

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:42.640
 and as you see in my case it marks the letter j 

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:44.950
 this may vary and you can 

00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:48.540
 leave another letter just make sure it's 

00:04:44.950 --> 00:04:48.540
 that of the mounted virtual unit 

00:04:49.169 --> 00:04:54.569
 we return to ms 2 we write the letter of 

00:04:52.469 --> 00:04:57.340
 unit 

00:04:54.569 --> 00:05:00.500
 two points 

00:04:57.340 --> 00:05:03.110
 reverse diagonal 

00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:05.550
 asterisk 

00:05:03.110 --> 00:05:08.050
 point 

00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:10.630
 get rich 

00:05:08.050 --> 00:05:13.260
 space 

00:05:10.630 --> 00:05:15.600
 diagonal 

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:18.560
 s 

00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:18.560
 diagonal 

00:05:20.449 --> 00:05:25.470
 diagonal 

00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:28.120
 efe 

00:05:25.470 --> 00:05:30.420
 diagonal 

00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:33.380
 h 

00:05:30.420 --> 00:05:33.380
 space 

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:38.680
 now we will write the letter of the unit 

00:05:36.580 --> 00:05:41.170
 of storage in which we will record or 

00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:43.660
 be the usb which in my case is the letter f 

00:05:41.170 --> 00:05:46.180
 as I had already told you this letter can 

00:05:43.660 --> 00:05:48.280
 vary with you then we type the 

00:05:46.180 --> 00:05:51.400
 letter of our usb and 

00:05:48.280 --> 00:05:52.990
 reverse diagonal and we give enter already only 

00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:54.970
 we will have to wait for it to be recorded 

00:05:52.990 --> 00:05:56.920
 our system image to be able to 

00:05:54.970 --> 00:05:58.690
 install on the computer you want 

00:05:56.920 --> 00:06:01.000
 this may take several minutes 

00:05:58.690 --> 00:06:03.070
 depending on the size of our image 

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:06.930
 iso cut the video to be able to 

00:06:03.070 --> 00:06:06.930
 show how it is finished 

00:06:09.540 --> 00:06:14.220
 once finished it will appear x 

00:06:11.790 --> 00:06:17.060
 files copied as appropriate such 

00:06:14.220 --> 00:06:19.430
 as shown here 

00:06:17.060 --> 00:06:21.530
 and once this is done we can use 

00:06:19.430 --> 00:06:24.420
 our usb to install the system 

00:06:21.530 --> 00:06:26.970
 operative that we recorded 

00:06:24.420 --> 00:06:28.620
 I use this method all the time because 

00:06:26.970 --> 00:06:30.390
 I have used several programs that I have 

00:06:28.620 --> 00:06:32.250
 downloaded from the internet but they give me 

00:06:30.390 --> 00:06:34.290
 unexpected errors so to do it 

00:06:32.250 --> 00:06:36.660
 in this way I believe in the personal is what 

00:06:34.290 --> 00:06:39.000
 more effective 

00:06:36.660 --> 00:06:42.210
 I hope and it will be of great help to you and your 

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:45.570
 please do not forget to click on I like 

00:06:42.210 --> 00:06:48.530
