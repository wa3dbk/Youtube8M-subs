00:00:06.590 --> 00:00:11.130
 it's a shaky one 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:13.700
 matter a dowel hole in one 

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:15.870
 thin and narrow bar to drill 

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:18.109
 either the holes are not in the 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:18.109
 center 

00:00:18.780 --> 00:00:24.880
 or the dowel sits crooked and around 

00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:26.940
 Bars can help dowels at all 

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:30.100
 not be used 

00:00:26.940 --> 00:00:32.050
 best forget to drill the dowel 

00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:34.240
 because if you have a vrees table in the 

00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:36.670
 You can have a workshop with a few 

00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:39.700
 Simple fixtures and a vrees 

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:43.590
 table to almost every wooden strip 

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:43.590
 Milling round trunnions 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:58.590
 the first device to edit 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:01.710
 angular cross sections consists of a 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:04.559
 thin stop plate on a double 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:08.100
 from mdf and a box with 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:10.410
 different leadership than routers 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:14.550
 best use one as possible 

00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:16.110
 big spiral notch cutter by his 

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:18.619
 the drawing will be cut 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:21.060
 lap times milled particularly clean 

00:01:18.619 --> 00:01:24.110
 but also normal groove cutters 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:24.110
 work fine 

00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:39.330
 in the next step you attach the 

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:41.340
 Two lever device so force 

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:43.920
 Bake the stop that the desired 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:46.880
 Guide hole approximately in the middle of the cutter 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:46.880
 is aligned 

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:04.900
 you can use the desired thong strength 

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:07.570
 simply set in which they the 

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:08.470
 stop velvet device on the food 

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:10.990
 move the table 

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:13.210
 The router then projects more or more 

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:18.360
 less into the guide holes 

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:21.340
 the more thinner and thinner it becomes 

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:24.150
 then turn on the router and 

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:26.830
 put the wooden strip into the leadless 

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:29.890
 while pushing the bar, press 

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:34.630
 at the same time slowly down 

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:35.470
 make the cutter slower and more even 

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:37.870
 downward 

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:40.900
 with continuous rotation of the bar in the 

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:43.030
 Clockwise results in an absolutely clean 

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:45.720
 and perfect center pressed and 

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:45.720
 facts 

00:02:57.990 --> 00:03:03.940
 even extremely thin round sagging of 

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:06.150
 just under 3 mm diameter are with this 

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:09.340
 Device a child game 

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:11.740
 only requirement the bar must 

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:15.540
 absolutely free of play in the lead hole 

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:15.540
 sit and do not wobble 

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:29.030
 you can almost get that way 

00:03:26.329 --> 00:03:29.900
 every square cross section a delicate one 

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:32.299
 compete 

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:35.090
 as long as you play the bar and free 

00:03:32.299 --> 00:03:37.870
 without wobbling in the guide holes 

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:37.870
 can turn 

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:27.400
 never bars and bars very well 

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:28.840
 a device is needed 

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:30.760
 stepless to the desired 

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:34.120
 diameter can be adjusted 

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:36.400
 it consists of a base plate one 

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:38.500
 thin stop plate one on top 

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:41.710
 Duplication and a movable one 

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:43.840
 Print board this device 

00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:45.850
 First attach only to the 

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:48.750
 left side of the milling cutters with shock 

00:04:45.850 --> 00:04:48.750
 a lever force 

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:56.780
 then put the dog in the died 

00:04:54.620 --> 00:04:59.630
 device and push the print 

00:04:56.780 --> 00:05:02.000
 board firmly against the conclusion of the 

00:04:59.630 --> 00:05:05.560
 Wing nut tighten firmly and the right 

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:05.560
 attach lever 

00:05:09.340 --> 00:05:13.580
 then switch the machine 

00:05:11.479 --> 00:05:15.530
 and stuck around the died 

00:05:13.580 --> 00:05:19.520
 simultaneous rotation in clockwise direction 

00:05:15.530 --> 00:05:21.770
 in the device when the dog died 

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:24.199
 on the lines stop plate hangs up 

00:05:21.770 --> 00:05:26.810
 rotate it several times clockwise 

00:05:24.199 --> 00:05:31.090
 and pull back with a 

00:05:26.810 --> 00:05:31.090
 Turning out of the device 

00:05:31.870 --> 00:05:37.600
 if you have round bars with similar size 

00:05:34.870 --> 00:05:39.880
 want to connect diameter sees one 

00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:42.670
 high kill shaped parapet essential 

00:05:39.880 --> 00:05:44.710
 more beautiful to screw yourself 

00:05:42.670 --> 00:05:47.530
 just two angles from multiplex 

00:05:44.710 --> 00:05:49.750
 along which the thicker left to 

00:05:47.530 --> 00:05:53.020
 pressure remains at 45 degrees 

00:05:49.750 --> 00:05:55.600
 then they are put off 

00:05:53.020 --> 00:05:58.300
 put hotel cutter in the machine and put 

00:05:55.600 --> 00:05:59.640
 the cutter height until shortly before the around 10 

00:05:58.300 --> 00:06:02.200
 1 

00:05:59.640 --> 00:06:04.630
 push the two stop bake 

00:06:02.200 --> 00:06:08.550
 close together and fasten first 

00:06:04.630 --> 00:06:08.550
 the right angle at the stop 

00:06:33.180 --> 00:06:38.130
 then set the second angle 

00:06:35.639 --> 00:06:42.620
 against the stop and pinch the round 

00:06:38.130 --> 00:06:42.620
 died firmly between the two angles 1 

00:06:54.759 --> 00:06:59.150
 then turn on the machines 

00:06:57.199 --> 00:07:01.310
 and stick the dog died with 

00:06:59.150 --> 00:07:04.430
 a rotation between the angles 

00:07:01.310 --> 00:07:07.370
 if he puts you stop tampris 

00:07:04.430 --> 00:07:10.490
 turn it clockwise until 

00:07:07.370 --> 00:07:12.409
 two times around the own axis from the 

00:07:10.490 --> 00:07:15.080
 sharp - edged parapet becomes so in the 

00:07:12.409 --> 00:07:17.680
 turn a visually appealing 

00:07:15.080 --> 00:07:17.680
 hollow throat
