be a bit of a pattern car crash we keep

00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:29.450 
be a bit of a pattern car crash we keep
it<00:05:27.300> quite<00:05:27.570> simple<00:05:27.600> so<00:05:28.260> I<00:05:28.320> got<00:05:28.470> these<00:05:28.710> next<00:05:29.280> ones

00:05:29.450 --> 00:05:29.460 
it quite simple so I got these next ones

00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:30.980 
it quite simple so I got these next ones
that<00:05:29.580> you're<00:05:29.730> also<00:05:29.970> in<00:05:30.360> the<00:05:30.420> sale<00:05:30.690> and<00:05:30.870> they

00:05:30.980 --> 00:05:30.990 
that you're also in the sale and they

00:05:30.990 --> 00:05:33.980 
that you're also in the sale and they
were<00:05:31.130> 13<00:05:32.130> is<00:05:32.430> super<00:05:33.090> super<00:05:33.210> bargain<00:05:33.750> they're

00:05:33.980 --> 00:05:33.990 
were 13 is super super bargain they're

00:05:33.990 --> 00:05:35.420 
were 13 is super super bargain they're
exactly<00:05:34.440> the<00:05:34.560> same<00:05:34.770> in<00:05:34.890> the<00:05:34.950> way<00:05:35.010> to<00:05:35.070> be<00:05:35.220> made

00:05:35.420 --> 00:05:35.430 
exactly the same in the way to be made

00:05:35.430 --> 00:05:36.830 
exactly the same in the way to be made
but<00:05:35.580> I<00:05:35.640> think<00:05:36.000> these<00:05:36.120> would<00:05:36.240> look<00:05:36.480> more<00:05:36.660> like

00:05:36.830 --> 00:05:36.840 
but I think these would look more like

00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:39.530 
but I think these would look more like
joggers<00:05:37.110> and<00:05:37.560> they<00:05:37.710> are<00:05:37.860> Laurel<00:05:38.640> which<00:05:38.940> is<00:05:39.270> not

00:05:39.530 --> 00:05:39.540 
joggers and they are Laurel which is not

00:05:39.540 --> 00:05:41.480 
joggers and they are Laurel which is not
for<00:05:39.840> the<00:05:39.900> faint-hearted<00:05:40.110> guys<00:05:40.740> I<00:05:41.040> absolutely

00:05:41.480 --> 00:05:41.490 
for the faint-hearted guys I absolutely

00:05:41.490 --> 00:05:43.250 
for the faint-hearted guys I absolutely
know<00:05:41.730> that<00:05:41.940> but<00:05:42.120> because<00:05:42.330> they<00:05:42.690> are<00:05:42.750> floral<00:05:43.200> I

00:05:43.250 --> 00:05:43.260 
know that but because they are floral I

00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:45.200 
know that but because they are floral I
think<00:05:43.500> I<00:05:43.560> slightly<00:05:43.830> smarter<00:05:44.070> so<00:05:44.760> you<00:05:44.820> can<00:05:44.970> team

00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:45.210 
think I slightly smarter so you can team

00:05:45.210 --> 00:05:47.570 
think I slightly smarter so you can team
