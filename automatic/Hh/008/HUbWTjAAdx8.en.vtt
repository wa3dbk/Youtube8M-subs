00:00:44.559 --> 00:00:50.139 

barrington<00:00:45.559> Griffin<00:00:48.340> so<00:00:49.340> my<00:00:49.579> mind<00:00:49.910> was<00:00:50.120> a

00:00:50.139 --> 00:00:50.149 
barrington Griffin so my mind was a

00:00:50.149 --> 00:00:53.700 
barrington Griffin so my mind was a
really<00:00:50.480> listen<00:00:50.840> themed<00:00:51.140> as<00:00:51.379> kind<00:00:51.590> of<00:00:51.649> flowing

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:53.710

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:00.370 

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:05.079 

intense<00:01:02.559> i<00:01:03.559> guess<00:01:03.769> not<00:01:04.550> very<00:01:04.790> descriptive

00:01:05.079 --> 00:01:05.089 
intense i guess not very descriptive

00:01:05.089 --> 00:01:06.780 
intense i guess not very descriptive
time<00:01:05.540> because<00:01:05.720> he<00:01:05.780> doesn't<00:01:05.960> do<00:01:06.140> a<00:01:06.170> lot<00:01:06.229> of<00:01:06.380> my

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:06.790 
time because he doesn't do a lot of my

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:09.880 
time because he doesn't do a lot of my
knowledge<00:01:07.790> living<00:01:08.360> nothing<00:01:08.690> but<00:01:09.200> actually

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:09.890 
knowledge living nothing but actually

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:12.160 
knowledge living nothing but actually
that<00:01:09.979> was<00:01:10.220> fine<00:01:10.399> so<00:01:10.940> the<00:01:11.360> original<00:01:11.720> idea<00:01:12.080> for

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:12.170 
that was fine so the original idea for

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:16.150 
that was fine so the original idea for
my<00:01:12.409> bindings<00:01:12.920> a<00:01:13.040> lot<00:01:13.190> to<00:01:13.340> d<00:01:14.140> i'm<00:01:15.140> not<00:01:15.590> sure<00:01:15.649> i

00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:16.160 
my bindings a lot to d i'm not sure i

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:23.380 
my bindings a lot to d i'm not sure i
think<00:01:16.399> there<00:01:16.880> was<00:01:16.970> any<00:01:17.090> digging<00:01:17.390> in<00:01:17.660> it<00:01:22.390> well

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:23.390 
think there was any digging in it well
