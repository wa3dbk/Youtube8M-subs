 there are very good of all welcome a 

00:00:13.090 --> 00:00:16.119
 more time to my channel today I am here with a 

00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:18.189
 debate of the week as you see in the 

00:00:16.119 --> 00:00:19.509
 title that has seemed white 2 and 

00:00:18.189 --> 00:00:20.860
 well this debate of the week is going to be 

00:00:19.509 --> 00:00:22.360
 so that you have yours 

00:00:20.860 --> 00:00:23.770
 opinions about what has 

00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:25.480
 seemed the game since you took it 

00:00:23.770 --> 00:00:27.189
 playing or if you do not have it since you 

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:28.660
 you have watching on youtube that is to say that 

00:00:27.189 --> 00:00:31.599
 you give opinions from your experience 

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:33.160
 and do not judge if you do not know how it is already 

00:00:31.599 --> 00:00:35.019
 who is sure that it is not the same to see him 

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:36.850
 to play it but good first thing 

00:00:35.019 --> 00:00:38.470
 I'm going to do is give my opinion 

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:40.150
 good things and the bad things that I have 

00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:41.890
 seen more of the first thing why we 

00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:43.269
 let's cheat and later to see the 

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:45.460
 video you leave yours 

00:00:43.269 --> 00:00:47.440
 opinions but above all respect those of 

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:48.850
 others please and good before 

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:50.350
 nothing forgive me for the voice because 

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:52.600
 I guess you do not have to I still follow 

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:54.460
 I've been constipated for a few days 

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:56.650
 but obviously I can not do anything 

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:59.979
 this is one thing that everyone is 

00:00:56.650 --> 00:01:01.510
 it's just coming and I'm telling you these days 

00:00:59.979 --> 00:01:04.059
 the videos that I upload I will continue constipated 

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:07.240
 but, well, obviously this will be 

00:01:04.059 --> 00:01:09.580
 it ends up being worth the redundancy and 

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:11.560
 well let's go to what I thought 

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:13.720
 I white two, well, the truth is 

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:15.939
 that when he saw the first trailer of this 

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:16.540
 game I absolutely did not like anything the 

00:01:15.939 --> 00:01:18.820
 trailer of 

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:20.530
 multiplayer campaign when I saw the 

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:22.510
 tanks with legs and other things the 

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:24.550
 truth is that I did not like the game 

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:26.710
 absolutely nothing left me very much that 

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:28.180
 wish they gave him very little expectations 

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:31.300
 which is a failure that we commit so many 

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:33.430
 and criticize a thing before seeing it but 

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:34.840
 as I tell you I did not like it absolutely 

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:37.120
 nothing I thought I was not going to buy it 

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:39.130
 then later they removed the trailers from 

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:41.740
 multiplayer that there the thing changed 

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:44.140
 I honestly started to like the 

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:45.850
 playability and so on but obviously still 

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:49.060
 I had not tried it the game did not have it 

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:52.180
 since this 3 or 4 months ago by 

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:54.550
 so to say it and the truth with the trailer 

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:56.770
 multiplayer I got the urge to 

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:58.900
 play the game but I still do not 

00:01:56.770 --> 00:02:02.020
 filled totally like any other 

00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:04.150
 call of duty but I tell kids to 

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:06.759
 the week of playing this game I 

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:08.950
 has impressed enough I love the 

00:02:06.759 --> 00:02:10.959
 gameplay I think they have mixed a 

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:12.310
 little bit of all the call of duty I 

00:02:10.959 --> 00:02:14.470
 I think he has the best of everyone 

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:17.800
 honestly the gameplay I already tell you 

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:20.110
 I love weapons, I love them, not bone 

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:21.970
 I know what to use for example me when 

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:23.230
 we played war 3 I knew it was going to end 

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:25.720
 using 

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:27.670
 7 the app 90 on CR and any other 

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:29.110
 sitting because honestly it is with what 

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:31.330
 we are not the best 

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:33.340
 fact of being quoted but I already tell you in 

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:34.750
 this game is an infinity of weapons 

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:36.400
 I do not know which one to put in each game 

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:37.989
 because it is that I feel good with each 

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:40.420
 one of them then there is the theme 

00:02:37.989 --> 00:02:42.480
 silencer that bothers me a 

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:44.530
 little more since I like to go 

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:46.720
 silent so to speak it is obviously 

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:48.459
 for what it serves I like that people 

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:50.200
 do not see me on the minimap when he shot 

00:02:48.459 --> 00:02:51.970
 and the truth is that in this game the 

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:54.040
 silenced the damage has gone down a lot 

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:56.319
 leaves a lot to be desired but good 

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:57.879
 I think it's more balanced because in 

00:02:56.319 --> 00:02:59.110
 other games the muffler was 

00:02:57.879 --> 00:03:00.519
 tight 

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:02.140
 then maps maps have 

00:03:00.519 --> 00:03:05.290
 delighted here you are seeing I am 

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:07.480
 playing raid the mansion as well 

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:08.859
 say it so that I love it already 

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:11.319
 you will see the final result of the game 

00:03:08.859 --> 00:03:13.390
 it's amazing but I already tell you the maps 

00:03:11.319 --> 00:03:15.459
 absolutely everyone I like 

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:17.290
 I guess I'll change my mind with the 

00:03:15.459 --> 00:03:19.569
 the passage of time with the passage of 

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:20.950
 campers that I already tell you for sure 

00:03:19.569 --> 00:03:23.349
 find the sites to change 

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:25.030
 perfect about the gusts not yet 

00:03:23.349 --> 00:03:26.620
 I have no stipulated any fixed 

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:28.510
 so that you understand it better now as 

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:29.910
 you see I'm playing with the ub lightning and 

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:31.560
 uve sad orbital that is like 

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:33.570
 but I'm telling you, I usually change them 

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:35.130
 constantly and good this is my 

00:03:33.570 --> 00:03:36.840
 pretty positive game view the 

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:38.220
 only flaw that I see is the connection 

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:40.020
 but I guess they will change it with the 

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:42.120
 some patch since the game has just 

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:43.710
 leave and nothing that's all leave your 

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:44.940
 opinions in the comments I hope that 

00:03:43.710 --> 00:03:49.250
 you liked it and see you next 

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:49.250
 video a greeting and see you later chao 

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:56.900
 of extension and what if x women
