00:00:01.730 --> 00:00:05.590
 Hi everyone of the world rubber market 

00:00:05.590 --> 00:00:08.301
 This theme is 

00:00:08.301 --> 00:00:12.680
 Unpack the shoulders that will be here 

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:17.929
 I would like to introduce an easy way to do a rally 

00:00:17.929 --> 00:00:20.130
 I think many people say 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:23.349
 For those who are good at table tennis or coaches 

00:00:23.349 --> 00:00:25.999
 Relax your shoulders more relaxed 

00:00:25.999 --> 00:00:27.700
 Those who are told that it is better to hit the ball 

00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:30.800
 I think so many I actually do such a consultation 

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:35.190
 The power of the shoulder may be received 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:37.820
 I did not swing well I did not hit smoothly 

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:40.180
 People who are said that 

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:51.809
 It seems that there are many 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:56.149
 This time you can play with the power of that shoulder 

00:00:56.149 --> 00:00:59.780
 I would like to introduce an easy way to do rallying 

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:04.140
 In this place where I would like to lose power 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:07.380
 I will try to narrow down and talk 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:11.780
 As this is only one really easy point 

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:14.070
 I think I will be aware of it soon 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:17.790
 That's the point but like drawing a circular motion 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:21.300
 Please try to hit and take fore as an example 

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:27.040
 It is such feeling It is such feeling if it is back 

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:29.850
 This is the reason why 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:32.900
 Most of the people who do not lose their shoulder strength 

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:39.780
 There are so many people doing very linear movements 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:42.700
 This is true too 

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:46.390
 Shake and draw to move in a straight line 

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:50.320
 It's about stopping and pulling the force once again and shaking it 

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:53.280
 Because it is repeated, the power of the shoulder is very 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:56.220
 It's easy to get in. People who are doing it that way 

00:01:56.220 --> 00:01:58.460
 The power is always on 

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:02.320
 Because I put a lot of power on shaking and pulling 

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:06.600
 The power of the shoulder is easy to enter so that it rotates 

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:10.840
 If you hit it, stop once and pull it down 

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:13.799
 There is no need to 

00:02:13.799 --> 00:02:15.340
 I can swing 

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:19.769
 This is the same as the back, so this rotational movement 

00:02:19.769 --> 00:02:24.519
 Just be aware of this circular movement 

00:02:24.519 --> 00:02:27.120
 I wonder if I can easily remove my power right now 

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:31.260
 I think this is really 

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:33.569
 Usually with the first fore or back strike 

00:02:33.569 --> 00:02:37.519
 It's something you can do right away 

00:02:37.519 --> 00:02:42.030
 If I'm worried because I have too much shoulder power now 

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:45.490
 The strength of the shoulders of the teammates and teaching people 

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:48.180
 If you are troubled that you can not go out 

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:51.950
 I think that you should practice immediately by all means 

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:55.470
 In fact, fore strike and back strike 

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:57.560
 Please try to see
