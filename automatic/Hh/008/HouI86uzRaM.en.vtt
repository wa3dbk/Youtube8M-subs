00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:04.740
 hello everyone and welcome to fun test 

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:06.420
 for a new test this time it is not 

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:09.059
 not a phone but it's a headset 

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:10.769
 beats by dr dre mixer so the copy 

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:12.420
 course that comes from china 

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:13.740
 orders and by the site of the ages gates 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:16.680
 so here is one case what I have 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:18.420
 ordered by tl gates and kim was delivered 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:20.670
 by bms so that changes a little bit of the dr 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:23.730
 the usual one the level of deadlines 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:24.990
 it was as fast as if dr chen 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:27.630
 it is only after these chronopost that 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:28.650
 takes over once msa to 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:31.019
 send the package to France 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:32.430
 So here on one side there is a little bit 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:33.390
 more chance of getting caught at the 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:35.940
 customs of what I have seen 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:37.770
 since the helmet these facts remained a 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:39.149
 little bit of customs it was opened but 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:40.079
 it was sent to me so I guess 

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:42.120
 it's because he was so good 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:44.670
 in the end they did not know if 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:45.809
 it was a real or after game info if not 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:47.430
 I 'm not going to explain anything else or 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:49.350
 it was christmas before the time 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:50.850
 I know this but it is certain 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:52.920
 that it happened to me so here is after 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:55.890
 customs inspection so that's it 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:57.780
 so the box as we can see is 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:00.210
 exactly like the real there is really 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:01.699
 all the details that's why I 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:04.350
 think they have not necessarily been able to see 

00:01:01.699 --> 00:01:05.939
 with a small magnetic closure for 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:07.710
 access to other languages 

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:11.130
 by default we have the French language and 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:12.600
 English here so like on the real 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:14.220
 box I think that there we will not be able 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:16.650
 really make the difference everything is 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:18.290
 we will not dwell on it 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:22.080
 it is not the most interesting 

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:23.729
 here we have the box that is with a 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:25.380
 logo big what is difficult to distinguish 

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:27.720
 according to the light veil you see that a 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:29.369
 local piss on that's when we 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:33.720
 the loving craft and it's the same as on 

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:36.509
 the real one here is there we dr dre machin 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:37.159
 or with us we found two in the 

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:39.240
 manual 

00:01:37.159 --> 00:01:40.170
 I do not have open because you know 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:43.229
 not much so emmanuel 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:46.350
 little chiffonnette stickers here 

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:48.060
 like on the paper normal game of beats 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:49.909
 and here we find what interests us 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:53.100
 so the helmet in his little box 

00:01:49.909 --> 00:01:54.990
 pretty classy that's the same as the 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:57.149
 beats there is no noticeable difference 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:02:01.570
 on the box is exactly the same as 

00:01:57.149 --> 00:02:04.610
 the truths so we go to the box 

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:07.220
 of transport so here we see the 

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:09.470
 helmet that goes well folded in we go 

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:11.030
 a cable like this with a small microphone 

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:12.770
 that's not bad for phones 

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:14.510
 all that and even that makes it possible to 

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:16.340
 manage the remote control handles the play it 

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:19.190
 put my load so that's really 

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:22.730
 not bad this one you're the truck beats 

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:26.120
 this is logotÃ© beats with marc and beats a 

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:27.470
 everywhere it is exactly at 

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:29.030
 cable level it's exactly the 

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:30.260
 same as the original that was also 

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:31.670
 a bola that provides with that me 

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:32.300
 I use more since I do a little bit of 

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:33.769
 jogging 

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:36.560
 so it's nice enough to be able to 

00:02:33.769 --> 00:02:37.610
 put on his turntable and not too much blah 

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:40.310
 we have a small spring that allows 

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:42.140
 to avoid that the cap tears off Canton 

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:43.010
 when we move a little too much or we have 

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:44.840
 tendency to shoot 

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:47.930
 it avoids doing damage it's not 

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:50.720
 badly there so we have a jack output 3 5 is 

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:52.010
 also normal jack that can be said who 

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:52.310
 is directly connected we can not 

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:55.580
 remove 

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:56.660
 finally care to cut so here and that 

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:58.370
 it's pretty good when you want to 

00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:59.510
 connect to a turntable or so 

00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:02.300
 This is a helmet was still designed 

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:05.180
 earlier for the dj so here it is 

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:07.070
 not bad the cash when himself so the 

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:10.670
 more interesting in her in this 

00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:13.640
 story so here foldable like the 

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:15.500
 true we unfold like those we feel 

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:16.850
 although they on the screen it's at the level of 

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:19.700
 the quality is really impressive 

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:22.940
 I had the truth in my hands 

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:24.489
 many times and honestly it's worth 

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:27.170
 a high level of quality 

00:03:24.489 --> 00:03:30.680
 so here we see the monster logo just 

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:32.510
 here the mention beats mixr this is my 

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:34.820
 piece these plastics a plastic cto 

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:35.900
 like the finish of the normal beats there 

00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:37.280
 we may have a little bit of aluminum 

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:39.680
 there the branches are made of aluminum 

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:41.450
 just right here on the real ones 

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:43.970
 headphones are plastic with logo b 

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:46.130
 on one side it lifts straight up 

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:48.049
 this one there is a little bit crooked it's 

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:50.780
 a lack of finish no it's not 

00:03:48.049 --> 00:03:53.329
 huge but there is still so to 

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:56.269
 pick up here are the pads are good 

00:03:53.329 --> 00:03:57.680
 facts and the headphones move well like 

00:03:56.269 --> 00:03:58.519
 true that stands of course the ear 

00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:02.329
 it's nice enough 

00:03:58.519 --> 00:04:03.890
 so here we have the mention monster 

00:04:02.329 --> 00:04:06.480
 as you can see if it's necessary that 

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:08.069
 I just do it here 

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:11.220
 and on the other side we find the 

00:04:08.069 --> 00:04:14.280
 mention beats by dr dre that's how 

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:16.790
 right and left on the headphones here 

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:18.510
 so the headphones can plug in 

00:04:16.790 --> 00:04:20.820
 independently on one or the other 

00:04:18.510 --> 00:04:22.560
 the jack cable it changes absolutely nothing 

00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:24.810
 the blood comes out of the two earphones at each 

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:26.190
 time there is no difference but 

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:29.729
 it's really just how you 

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:32.130
 prefer that the cable passes here is the 

00:04:29.729 --> 00:04:34.830
 the hoop I forgot to say yes that the 

00:04:32.130 --> 00:04:36.750
 the material is very nice it's soft 

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:39.270
 touch and on the head it does not hurt 

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:40.680
 it's really well done that it's 

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:43.620
 exactly the same material as on the 

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:44.639
 true clearly it's pretty diffuse I 

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:46.889
 do not think we can really find 

00:04:44.639 --> 00:04:48.000
 big differences in sound 

00:04:46.889 --> 00:04:49.500
 I will put you a little music 

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:50.729
 story to realize but it's going 

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:52.440
 be hard enough a helmet it's worth 

00:04:50.729 --> 00:04:54.539
 better to leave there is that when talking and 

00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:56.010
 that listened to it like that through a 

00:04:54.539 --> 00:05:01.229
 camera it's not going to tell you big 

00:04:56.010 --> 00:05:06.900
 thing finally short here we are so the 

00:05:01.229 --> 00:05:09.479
 volume is all right so this is a 

00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:11.490
 headphones and there is a very very good are 

00:05:09.479 --> 00:05:13.139
 really comparable to the original for 

00:05:11.490 --> 00:05:15.320
 to have had it on the ears listen 

00:05:13.139 --> 00:05:18.330
 for quite a long time 

00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:19.860
 the problem I had was that 

00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:22.430
 compared to the head it's a little 

00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:25.349
 tight it is very well insulated 

00:05:22.430 --> 00:05:27.120
 the headphones are nice but she 

00:05:25.349 --> 00:05:29.160
 so after several hours of 

00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:30.240
 listen we are left to do anyway 

00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:31.919
 a little sore ear because they 

00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:32.820
 are compressed by the fact that 

00:05:31.919 --> 00:05:34.620
 headphones come to rest on 

00:05:32.820 --> 00:05:36.510
 the ear actually faces the problem 

00:05:34.620 --> 00:05:38.700
 would also be with the real thing nothing changes 

00:05:36.510 --> 00:05:40.500
 at all but that's good it's enough to 

00:05:38.700 --> 00:05:43.169
 after a while it becomes unpleasant 

00:05:40.500 --> 00:05:46.590
 even if it remains largely tolerable 

00:05:43.169 --> 00:05:47.460
 so that's the sound is really at the 

00:05:46.590 --> 00:05:49.229
 height of the original 

00:05:47.460 --> 00:05:51.120
 in some cases what cost me 65 

00:05:49.229 --> 00:05:51.720
 euros and for that price I did not 

00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:54.150
 not having 

00:05:51.720 --> 00:05:57.479
 far from it is really very very good 

00:05:54.150 --> 00:06:00.180
 and I think that find something 

00:05:57.479 --> 00:06:02.400
 those of this quality in France 

00:06:00.180 --> 00:06:03.539
 at 65 euros it's more to know what 

00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:04.650
 it's really more to know for the 

00:06:03.539 --> 00:06:06.479
 quality that comes out it's really the 

00:06:04.650 --> 00:06:07.440
 quality of the original and low are 

00:06:06.479 --> 00:06:10.500
 just awesome 

00:06:07.440 --> 00:06:11.970
 if in addition you have a pc or because 

00:06:10.500 --> 00:06:13.770
 I had a pc with audio beats 

00:06:11.970 --> 00:06:15.419
 if in addition you have a pc with this 

00:06:13.770 --> 00:06:17.130
 system or even a phone I know that 

00:06:15.419 --> 00:06:19.949
 htc was doing this kind of phone 

00:06:17.130 --> 00:06:21.150
 it's something pretty 

00:06:19.949 --> 00:06:22.860
 impressive is found with 

00:06:21.150 --> 00:06:24.810
 low but huge what really huge 

00:06:22.860 --> 00:06:26.820
 so on all dance music and 

00:06:24.810 --> 00:06:28.050
 Well, we like music 

00:06:26.820 --> 00:06:30.120
 classic we appreciate much less 

00:06:28.050 --> 00:06:31.770
 but hey, we do not buy 1 4 like that 

00:06:30.120 --> 00:06:32.509
 General to listen to music 

00:06:31.770 --> 00:06:35.130
 classical 

00:06:32.509 --> 00:06:37.229
 I do not think it would be 

00:06:35.130 --> 00:06:37.889
 not my choice personally for this 

00:06:37.229 --> 00:06:39.870
 type of music 

00:06:37.889 --> 00:06:40.949
 but especially what is current music 

00:06:39.870 --> 00:06:44.130
 it's true that it's still 

00:06:40.949 --> 00:06:45.449
 something pretty cool enough so here I 

00:06:44.130 --> 00:06:46.500
 you will put the link of course in 

00:06:45.449 --> 00:06:49.139
 the descriptions if you want 

00:06:46.500 --> 00:06:50.430
 buy it I will receive another 

00:06:49.139 --> 00:06:52.530
 of another color so I'm going 

00:06:50.430 --> 00:06:53.910
 receive the neon blue normally 

00:06:52.530 --> 00:06:57.000
 tomorrow so hopefully so I'll you 

00:06:53.910 --> 00:06:59.699
 will present in the video not in the 

00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:02.099
 stride but a little bit later 

00:06:59.699 --> 00:07:04.470
 that one cost me 65 euros and the other 

00:07:02.099 --> 00:07:05.940
 cost me 50.5 euros which we will see if 

00:07:04.470 --> 00:07:09.570
 is really a big difference 

00:07:05.940 --> 00:07:12.979
 between this one and the other one here and
