00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:09.460
 If I do not bring you a new review of a 

00:00:03.760 --> 00:00:14.440
 minecraft mode clearly and good at 

00:00:09.460 --> 00:00:16.120
 this case is hydrate mode and it puts 

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:19.380
 in blog although I 've done it with pistons 

00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:23.769
 and it does not look good to see a very long name 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:31.570
 and we're going to see that this includes a download 

00:00:23.769 --> 00:00:35.079
 little let's see a character but not 

00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:40.270
 it works is supposed to have changed but 

00:00:35.079 --> 00:00:43.030
 on the wiki because it gives me 

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:45.430
 because the image does not come out is damaged 

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:48.460
 I come back like this we are not going to take this 

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:51.190
 suppose it was like that with crystal wheat and 

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:54.520
 a bucket of water is not the hydrate block 

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:57.670
 but it's not like that anymore I do not know how it is but it's 

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:59.920
 say that this amount is for 1.5 point 1 

00:00:57.670 --> 00:01:03.129
 then and the mountains this version 

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:05.430
 change are compatible with the 1.5 and 

00:01:03.129 --> 00:01:09.190
 it works with way in this what it does 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:11.619
 because this block is simulated by the ground 

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:14.440
 the only water that we can go through 

00:01:11.619 --> 00:01:16.790
 over him and well we see here the 

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:20.710
 crops 

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:23.690
 and as you can see, all this is done with 

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:26.770
 with blocks of these because you see leads 

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:26.770
 like water or anything 

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:34.720
 and good we are going to so that you see what 

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:37.090
 take this 

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:38.890
 because it did not get wet I'm going to give everything very 

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:39.630
 here on the corner and he will not put it 

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:42.900
 comrade 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:42.900
 Let's go there 

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:36.740
 well I do not have here the three minutes in 

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:38.840
 wetting 14 blocks these two I do not know why 

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:41.030
 they do not work but you see that 

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:43.370
 water works just as well 

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:48.120
 It works with sugar cane because you see 

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:53.500
 that we can put them with results 

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:57.380
 well we are here 

00:02:53.500 --> 00:03:00.069
 if this is not because there was no water 

00:02:57.380 --> 00:03:04.250
 would let us not let us put it but 

00:03:00.069 --> 00:03:07.850
 how is this block does work 

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:11.960
 and good also works with you and with 

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:16.600
 all because good is wet the earth and 

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:16.600
 well this mode has nothing else 

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:25.340
 and I hope you liked it and nothing 

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:29.500
 serious beautiful subscribe music with me 

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:29.500
