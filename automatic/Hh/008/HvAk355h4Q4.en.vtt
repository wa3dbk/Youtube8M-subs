need to carefully do it because you can
tear<00:02:19.930> it<00:02:19.959> and<00:02:20.290> then<00:02:20.500> there<00:02:20.740> goes<00:02:20.770> your<00:02:20.950> spring

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:21.430 
tear it and then there goes your spring

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:25.190 
tear it and then there goes your spring

roll and there you have it so here are

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:17.870 
roll and there you have it so here are
the<00:03:15.630> two<00:03:15.780> run<00:03:15.960> I<00:03:16.260> just<00:03:17.010> rolled<00:03:17.160> it<00:03:17.280> up<00:03:17.400> and<00:03:17.580> then

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:17.880 
the two run I just rolled it up and then

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:19.310 
the two run I just rolled it up and then
now<00:03:18.060> we're<00:03:18.210> going<00:03:18.360> to<00:03:18.450> fry<00:03:18.660> it<00:03:18.690> make<00:03:18.930> sure<00:03:18.960> your

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:19.320 
now we're going to fry it make sure your

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:32.730 
now we're going to fry it make sure your
oil<00:03:19.350> is<00:03:19.890> hot<00:03:20.160> enough<00:03:22.010> perfect

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:32.740 

00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:36.030 

so<00:03:33.610> I'm<00:03:33.940> just<00:03:34.240> putting<00:03:34.960> the<00:03:35.260> Turin<00:03:35.590> in<00:03:35.800> here

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:36.040 
so I'm just putting the Turin in here

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:37.560 
so I'm just putting the Turin in here
and<00:03:36.190> this<00:03:36.340> is<00:03:36.460> perfect<00:03:36.880> you<00:03:37.000> want<00:03:37.090> the<00:03:37.270> oil<00:03:37.300> to

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:37.570 
and this is perfect you want the oil to

00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:40.250 
and this is perfect you want the oil to
bubble<00:03:37.960> like<00:03:38.110> that<00:03:38.320> and<00:03:38.560> when<00:03:38.890> it<00:03:39.010> does<00:03:39.310> it's

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:40.260 
bubble like that and when it does it's

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:42.960 
bubble like that and when it does it's
probably<00:03:41.260> take<00:03:41.710> two<00:03:42.010> minutes<00:03:42.220> to<00:03:42.550> cook<00:03:42.730> on<00:03:42.940> one

00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:42.970 
probably take two minutes to cook on one

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:45.420 
probably take two minutes to cook on one
side<00:03:43.120> and<00:03:43.690> then<00:03:44.410> two<00:03:44.800> minutes<00:03:45.070> on<00:03:45.160> the<00:03:45.250> other

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:45.430 
side and then two minutes on the other

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:48.060 
side and then two minutes on the other
side<00:03:45.760> but<00:03:46.060> what<00:03:46.360> I<00:03:46.420> like<00:03:46.660> to<00:03:46.810> do<00:03:47.020> is<00:03:47.350> I<00:03:47.860> like<00:03:48.010> to

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:48.070 
side but what I like to do is I like to

00:03:48.070 --> 00:03:49.010 
side but what I like to do is I like to
check

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:49.020 
check
