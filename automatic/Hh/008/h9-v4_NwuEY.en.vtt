take one section um maybe that normally
lays<00:02:06.940> this<00:02:07.090> way<00:02:07.300> and<00:02:07.570> then<00:02:07.720> you<00:02:07.870> at<00:02:08.140> night

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:08.700 
lays this way and then you at night

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:12.980 
lays this way and then you at night
basically<00:02:09.720> pin<00:02:10.720> it<00:02:10.869> over<00:02:11.260> the<00:02:11.590> opposite<00:02:12.160> way

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:12.990 
basically pin it over the opposite way

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:15.930 
basically pin it over the opposite way
pin<00:02:13.990> it<00:02:14.200> and<00:02:14.350> in<00:02:14.830> the<00:02:14.890> morning<00:02:15.100> when<00:02:15.460> you<00:02:15.610> undo

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:15.940 
pin it and in the morning when you undo

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:18.990 
pin it and in the morning when you undo
the<00:02:16.090> pin<00:02:16.360> you'll<00:02:17.110> have<00:02:17.380> more<00:02:18.130> volume<00:02:18.640> and

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:19.000 
the pin you'll have more volume and

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:23.130 
the pin you'll have more volume and
stuff<00:02:19.300> like<00:02:19.450> that<00:02:19.510> so<00:02:20.940> that<00:02:21.940> is<00:02:22.180> what<00:02:23.110> I

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:23.140 
stuff like that so that is what I

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:24.930 
stuff like that so that is what I
learned<00:02:23.590> with<00:02:23.830> these<00:02:23.980> mini<00:02:24.280> twists<00:02:24.700> i'm<00:02:24.820> going

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:24.940 
learned with these mini twists i'm going

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:26.940 
learned with these mini twists i'm going
to<00:02:25.000> keep<00:02:25.180> these<00:02:25.360> things<00:02:25.390> in<00:02:25.690> mind<00:02:25.750> when<00:02:26.710> i<00:02:26.770> put

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:26.950 
to keep these things in mind when i put

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:30.240 
to keep these things in mind when i put
them<00:02:27.100> back<00:02:27.250> in<00:02:27.490> soon<00:02:28.030> i<00:02:28.360> am<00:02:29.230> getting<00:02:29.740> ready<00:02:29.980> to

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:30.250 
them back in soon i am getting ready to

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:31.770 
them back in soon i am getting ready to
remove<00:02:30.580> them<00:02:30.820> using<00:02:31.180> the<00:02:31.270> pretty<00:02:31.540> dimples

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:31.780 
remove them using the pretty dimples

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:34.800 
remove them using the pretty dimples
method<00:02:32.350> i<00:02:32.470> think<00:02:32.770> i<00:02:32.890> showed<00:02:33.190> that<00:02:33.490> in<00:02:33.760> a<00:02:34.510> past

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:34.810 
method i think i showed that in a past

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:39.050 
method i think i showed that in a past
video<00:02:35.050> i<00:02:35.290> don't<00:02:35.800> know<00:02:35.860> may<00:02:36.130> do<00:02:36.190> do<00:02:36.820> it<00:02:36.940> again<00:02:37.830> um

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:39.060 
video i don't know may do do it again um

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:41.220 
video i don't know may do do it again um
so<00:02:40.060> you<00:02:40.120> can<00:02:40.360> see<00:02:40.570> how<00:02:40.600> to<00:02:40.810> do<00:02:40.990> it<00:02:41.110> but

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:41.230 
so you can see how to do it but

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:42.750 
so you can see how to do it but
essentially<00:02:41.709> you<00:02:41.890> just<00:02:42.130> take<00:02:42.340> some

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:42.760 
essentially you just take some

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:45.300 
essentially you just take some
conditioner<00:02:43.300> I<00:02:43.650> want<00:02:44.650> to<00:02:44.680> use<00:02:44.800> my<00:02:44.830> Aussie

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:45.310 
conditioner I want to use my Aussie

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:50.490 
conditioner I want to use my Aussie
moist<00:02:45.580> and<00:02:46.680> okay<00:02:47.680> I<00:02:47.920> can't<00:02:48.490> find<00:02:48.640> it<00:02:48.790> um<00:02:49.500> you

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:50.500 
moist and okay I can't find it um you

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:52.740 
moist and okay I can't find it um you
take<00:02:50.740> the<00:02:50.980> conditioner<00:02:51.550> and<00:02:51.730> your<00:02:52.239> denman

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:52.750 
take the conditioner and your denman

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:54.660 
take the conditioner and your denman
brush<00:02:52.780> and<00:02:53.290> then<00:02:53.320> you<00:02:53.560> just<00:02:53.830> basically<00:02:54.040> work

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:54.670 
brush and then you just basically work

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:57.390 
brush and then you just basically work
them<00:02:55.030> out<00:02:55.209> and<00:02:55.750> i'll<00:02:56.380> probably<00:02:56.620> take<00:02:57.040> me<00:02:57.220> about

00:02:57.390 --> 00:02:57.400 
them out and i'll probably take me about

00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:00.120 
them out and i'll probably take me about
20<00:02:57.760> minutes<00:02:57.790> to<00:02:58.120> do<00:02:58.300> that<00:02:58.510> and<00:02:58.840> then<00:02:59.200> i<00:02:59.739> will

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:00.130 
20 minutes to do that and then i will

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:07.250 
20 minutes to do that and then i will
wash<00:03:00.690> in<00:03:02.459> detangle<00:03:04.080> think<00:03:05.080> condition<00:03:05.709> I<00:03:06.090> guess

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:07.260 
wash in detangle think condition I guess

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:11.550 
wash in detangle think condition I guess
all<00:03:08.260> of<00:03:08.320> that<00:03:08.650> happy<00:03:08.980> stuff<00:03:09.750> and<00:03:10.750> then<00:03:11.050> go<00:03:11.380> from
