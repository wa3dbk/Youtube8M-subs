the<00:03:45.870> table<00:03:46.020> at<00:03:46.260> once<00:03:46.440> but<00:03:46.680> it's<00:03:46.860> probably<00:03:47.160> only

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:47.400 
the table at once but it's probably only

the table at once but it's probably only
thousands<00:03:48.060> during<00:03:49.050> multi-ball<00:03:49.620> there's

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:49.890 
thousands during multi-ball there's

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:51.650 
thousands during multi-ball there's
usually<00:03:50.010> a<00:03:50.280> ramp<00:03:50.580> or<00:03:50.760> Target<00:03:51.180> to<00:03:51.270> hit<00:03:51.420> for<00:03:51.630> a

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:51.660 
usually a ramp or Target to hit for a

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:53.810 
usually a ramp or Target to hit for a
jackpot<00:03:51.930> but<00:03:52.680> it's<00:03:52.830> all<00:03:52.950> I<00:03:52.980> can<00:03:53.100> do<00:03:53.340> to<00:03:53.489> just

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:53.820 
jackpot but it's all I can do to just

00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:55.940 
jackpot but it's all I can do to just
keep<00:03:54.030> the<00:03:54.150> balls<00:03:54.360> in<00:03:54.540> play<00:03:54.570> never<00:03:55.260> mind<00:03:55.620> aim<00:03:55.800> at

keep the balls in play never mind aim at
something<00:03:56.239> but<00:03:57.239> that's<00:03:57.420> what's<00:03:57.630> great<00:03:57.840> about

00:03:57.979 --> 00:03:57.989 
something but that's what's great about
