00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:55.869 

look<00:00:53.670> at<00:00:53.789> the<00:00:53.910> movement<00:00:54.420> of<00:00:54.570> these<00:00:54.809> hammers

look at the movement of these hammers

00:00:55.879 --> 00:01:01.759 
look at the movement of these hammers
the<00:00:56.879> center<00:00:57.359> one<00:00:57.570> is<00:00:57.989> moving<00:00:58.320> to<00:00:58.800> the<00:00:58.829> left<00:01:00.769> so

00:01:01.759 --> 00:01:01.769 
the center one is moving to the left so

00:01:01.769 --> 00:01:12.320 
the center one is moving to the left so
we<00:01:02.280> chalk<00:01:02.640> the<00:01:03.059> left<00:01:03.329> side<00:01:03.690> of<00:01:04.379> its<00:01:04.710> flange

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:23.660 

we<00:01:13.170> remove<00:01:13.590> the<00:01:13.800> hammer

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:27.469

00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:53.140 

you

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:53.150 

00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:55.650 

if<00:01:53.630> the<00:01:53.840> hammer<00:01:54.110> is<00:01:54.380> still<00:01:54.650> moving<00:01:55.070> sideways

00:01:55.650 --> 00:01:55.660 
if the hammer is still moving sideways

00:01:55.660 --> 00:02:06.950 
if the hammer is still moving sideways
add<00:01:56.660> another<00:01:57.200> paper

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:06.960 

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:09.400 

when<00:02:07.560> the<00:02:07.710> hammer<00:02:07.980> is<00:02:08.280> moving<00:02:08.670> correctly

00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:09.410 
when the hammer is moving correctly

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:19.800 
when the hammer is moving correctly
space<00:02:10.410> it<00:02:10.649> nicely<00:02:11.100> between<00:02:11.310> its<00:02:11.700> neighbors

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:19.810 

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:23.970 

now<00:02:20.260> check<00:02:20.680> the<00:02:21.100> whippin<00:02:21.430> alignment<00:02:22.709> we<00:02:23.709> want

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:23.980 
now check the whippin alignment we want

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:26.880 
now check the whippin alignment we want
the<00:02:24.340> knuckle<00:02:24.790> to<00:02:25.569> be<00:02:25.720> centered<00:02:26.319> on<00:02:26.530> the

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:26.890 
the knuckle to be centered on the

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:30.449 
the knuckle to be centered on the
repetition<00:02:27.490> lever<00:02:27.990> not<00:02:28.990> off<00:02:29.620> to<00:02:30.130> the<00:02:30.250> side

00:02:30.449 --> 00:02:30.459 
repetition lever not off to the side

00:02:30.459 --> 00:02:35.220 
repetition lever not off to the side
like<00:02:30.760> this

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:35.230 

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:39.820 

we<00:02:36.230> also<00:02:36.500> want<00:02:37.010> the<00:02:37.550> wippen<00:02:38.060> heel<00:02:38.750> to<00:02:39.379> be<00:02:39.530> sent

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:39.830 
we also want the wippen heel to be sent

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:45.000 
we also want the wippen heel to be sent
around<00:02:39.950> the<00:02:40.250> capstan

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:45.010 

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:51.120 

be<00:02:45.069> centered<00:02:45.549> on<00:02:45.819> the<00:02:46.060> let<00:02:46.239> off<00:02:46.390> button

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:51.130 

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:53.760 

this<00:02:51.880> may<00:02:52.120> take<00:02:52.390> some<00:02:52.600> compromise<00:02:53.170> but<00:02:53.650> we

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:53.770 
this may take some compromise but we

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:56.190 
this may take some compromise but we
want<00:02:54.010> to<00:02:54.160> space<00:02:54.460> the<00:02:54.730> weapon<00:02:55.060> as<00:02:55.300> well<00:02:55.720> as<00:02:56.020> the

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:56.200 
want to space the weapon as well as the

00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:59.520 
want to space the weapon as well as the
situation<00:02:56.440> allows<00:02:58.080> loosening<00:02:59.080> the<00:02:59.230> flange

00:02:59.520 --> 00:02:59.530 
situation allows loosening the flange

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:07.910 
situation allows loosening the flange
screw<00:03:02.040> and<00:03:03.040> moving<00:03:03.550> the<00:03:03.700> wippen<00:03:04.260> may<00:03:05.260> help

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:07.920 

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:11.280 

often<00:03:08.920> you'll<00:03:09.550> also<00:03:09.760> need<00:03:10.090> to<00:03:10.300> use<00:03:10.330> a<00:03:10.840> bit<00:03:11.170> of

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:11.290 
often you'll also need to use a bit of

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:15.240 
often you'll also need to use a bit of
traveling<00:03:11.770> paper<00:03:13.140> travel<00:03:14.140> and<00:03:14.380> space<00:03:14.830> the

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:15.250 
traveling paper travel and space the

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:18.680 
traveling paper travel and space the
center<00:03:15.730> hammers<00:03:16.180> and<00:03:16.710> align<00:03:17.710> their<00:03:18.070> weapons

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:18.690 
center hammers and align their weapons

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:22.020 
center hammers and align their weapons
then<00:03:19.690> bring<00:03:20.110> the<00:03:20.320> jig<00:03:20.560> to<00:03:20.770> the<00:03:20.890> instructor<00:03:21.580> for

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:22.030 
then bring the jig to the instructor for

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:24.420 
then bring the jig to the instructor for
checking
