00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:47.270 
don't know about you guys but what's
gonna<00:03:45.209> be<00:03:45.360> behind<00:03:45.540> my<00:03:46.230> PlayStation<00:03:46.769> 4<00:03:46.920> camera

00:03:47.270 --> 00:03:47.280 
gonna be behind my PlayStation 4 camera

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:50.690 
gonna be behind my PlayStation 4 camera
is<00:03:47.430> going<00:03:47.580> to<00:03:47.640> be<00:03:47.820> the<00:03:48.330> screen<00:03:48.750> of<00:03:48.989> my<00:03:49.050> TV<00:03:49.530> so<00:03:50.340> I

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:50.700 
is going to be the screen of my TV so I

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:53.210 
is going to be the screen of my TV so I
don't<00:03:50.940> know<00:03:51.060> why<00:03:51.269> that's<00:03:51.510> really<00:03:51.750> there<00:03:52.709> maybe

00:03:53.210 --> 00:03:53.220 
don't know why that's really there maybe

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:55.940 
don't know why that's really there maybe
for<00:03:53.519> some<00:03:53.790> other<00:03:53.940> cases<00:03:54.239> I<00:03:54.840> don't<00:03:54.930> know<00:03:55.200> but

00:03:55.940 --> 00:03:55.950 
for some other cases I don't know but

00:03:55.950 --> 00:03:57.890 
for some other cases I don't know but
for<00:03:56.190> me<00:03:56.340> that's<00:03:56.580> not<00:03:56.700> gonna<00:03:57.090> really<00:03:57.330> be<00:03:57.570> useful

00:03:57.890 --> 00:03:57.900 
for me that's not gonna really be useful

00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:00.650 
for me that's not gonna really be useful
to<00:03:58.350> have<00:03:58.500> that<00:03:58.769> but<00:03:59.280> anyways<00:03:59.610> combine<00:04:00.390> this

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:00.660 
to have that but anyways combine this

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:02.420 
to have that but anyways combine this
with<00:04:00.720> the<00:04:00.930> face<00:04:01.230> recognition<00:04:01.440> and<00:04:02.100> scanning

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:02.430 
with the face recognition and scanning

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:04.460 
with the face recognition and scanning
technology<00:04:03.209> and<00:04:03.420> it's<00:04:03.540> pretty<00:04:03.810> clear<00:04:04.050> that<00:04:04.080> we

00:04:04.460 --> 00:04:04.470 
technology and it's pretty clear that we

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:06.740 
technology and it's pretty clear that we
might<00:04:04.920> even<00:04:05.280> begin<00:04:05.550> to<00:04:05.580> see<00:04:05.910> game<00:04:06.209> development

00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:06.750 
might even begin to see game development

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:09.050 
might even begin to see game development
trends<00:04:06.959> emerge<00:04:07.709> which<00:04:07.980> will<00:04:08.400> allow<00:04:08.820> players

00:04:09.050 --> 00:04:09.060 
trends emerge which will allow players

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:11.060 
trends emerge which will allow players
to<00:04:09.269> effectively<00:04:10.019> scan<00:04:10.320> their<00:04:10.500> faces<00:04:10.890> and

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:11.070 
to effectively scan their faces and

00:04:11.070 --> 00:04:13.520 
to effectively scan their faces and
stick<00:04:11.400> them<00:04:11.580> directly<00:04:12.120> onto<00:04:12.540> the<00:04:12.959> bodies<00:04:13.290> of

00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:13.530 
stick them directly onto the bodies of

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:15.259 
stick them directly onto the bodies of
certain<00:04:13.890> characters<00:04:14.400> which<00:04:14.910> is<00:04:15.060> pure

00:04:15.259 --> 00:04:15.269 
certain characters which is pure

00:04:15.269 --> 00:04:17.509 
certain characters which is pure
speculation<00:04:15.570> of<00:04:16.049> course<00:04:16.080> but<00:04:16.380> it's<00:04:17.280> still

00:04:17.509 --> 00:04:17.519 
speculation of course but it's still

00:04:17.519 --> 00:04:20.449 
speculation of course but it's still
reasonable<00:04:18.090> anyways<00:04:19.070> additionally<00:04:20.070> the<00:04:20.310> new
