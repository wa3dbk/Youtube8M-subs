Agrotech<00:00:04.319> and<00:00:04.710> today<00:00:04.920> I'm<00:00:05.279> going<00:00:05.400> to<00:00:05.490> talk

00:00:05.630 --> 00:00:05.640 
Agrotech and today I'm going to talk

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:07.519 
Agrotech and today I'm going to talk
very<00:00:05.790> quickly<00:00:06.000> about<00:00:06.210> phosphorus<00:00:06.960> and

00:00:07.519 --> 00:00:07.529 
very quickly about phosphorus and

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:12.860 
very quickly about phosphorus and
phosphate<00:00:08.189> in<00:00:08.460> your<00:00:08.670> system<00:00:11.389> so<00:00:12.389> phosphorus

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:12.870 
phosphate in your system so phosphorus

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:16.340 
phosphate in your system so phosphorus
is<00:00:13.049> the<00:00:13.230> P<00:00:13.469> in<00:00:13.740> our<00:00:14.360> NPK<00:00:15.360> rating<00:00:15.839> do<00:00:16.139> you<00:00:16.199> guys

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:16.350 
is the P in our NPK rating do you guys

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:18.439 
is the P in our NPK rating do you guys
remember<00:00:16.650> that<00:00:17.010> we've<00:00:17.880> already<00:00:18.029> talked<00:00:18.330> about

00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:18.449 
remember that we've already talked about

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:21.140 
remember that we've already talked about
nitrogen<00:00:19.140> in<00:00:19.320> detail<00:00:19.770> next<00:00:20.550> on<00:00:20.670> the<00:00:20.760> list<00:00:20.910> is

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:21.150 
nitrogen in detail next on the list is

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:22.670 
nitrogen in detail next on the list is
phosphorus<00:00:22.080> okay

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:22.680 
phosphorus okay

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:25.220 
phosphorus okay
phosphorus<00:00:23.550> is<00:00:23.730> a<00:00:23.789> really<00:00:24.240> really<00:00:24.449> important

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:25.230 
phosphorus is a really really important

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:27.380 
phosphorus is a really really important
element<00:00:25.410> in<00:00:25.800> plant<00:00:26.070> growth<00:00:26.460> and<00:00:26.730> develop<00:00:27.240> it

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:27.390 
element in plant growth and develop it

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:31.339 
element in plant growth and develop it
phosphorus<00:00:28.080> is<00:00:28.260> key<00:00:29.070> in<00:00:29.429> a<00:00:29.910> lot<00:00:30.150> of<00:00:30.349> cellular

00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:31.349 
phosphorus is key in a lot of cellular

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:33.799 
phosphorus is key in a lot of cellular
metabolism<00:00:31.679> and<00:00:32.340> a<00:00:32.669> lot<00:00:32.820> of<00:00:32.850> the<00:00:33.030> operations

00:00:33.799 --> 00:00:33.809 
metabolism and a lot of the operations

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:37.069 
metabolism and a lot of the operations
that<00:00:34.140> plants<00:00:34.829> do<00:00:35.070> internally<00:00:35.850> phosphorus<00:00:36.809> is

00:00:37.069 --> 00:00:37.079 
that plants do internally phosphorus is

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:39.650 
that plants do internally phosphorus is
kind<00:00:37.739> of<00:00:37.800> one<00:00:37.890> of<00:00:37.920> these<00:00:38.070> key<00:00:38.430> components<00:00:39.059> now

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:39.660 
kind of one of these key components now

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:40.869 
kind of one of these key components now
it<00:00:39.809> doesn't<00:00:40.110> get<00:00:40.200> a<00:00:40.230> whole<00:00:40.410> lot<00:00:40.559> of<00:00:40.680> attention

00:00:40.869 --> 00:00:40.879 
it doesn't get a whole lot of attention

00:00:40.879 --> 00:00:43.100 
it doesn't get a whole lot of attention
aquaponics<00:00:41.879> because<00:00:42.300> it's<00:00:42.629> simply<00:00:43.079> not

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:43.110 
aquaponics because it's simply not

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:45.979 
aquaponics because it's simply not
deficient<00:00:43.829> that<00:00:43.890> off<00:00:44.250> often<00:00:45.059> usually<00:00:45.809> there's

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
deficient that off often usually there's

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:49.360 
deficient that off often usually there's
enough<00:00:46.379> phosphorus<00:00:47.219> in<00:00:48.180> most<00:00:48.539> systems<00:00:48.989> now

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:49.370 
enough phosphorus in most systems now

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:52.069 
enough phosphorus in most systems now
when<00:00:50.370> people<00:00:50.700> do<00:00:50.910> start<00:00:51.180> seeing<00:00:51.539> phosphorus

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
when people do start seeing phosphorus

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:54.410 
when people do start seeing phosphorus
deficiency<00:00:52.379> in<00:00:52.920> aquaponic<00:00:53.579> systems<00:00:53.940> is<00:00:54.149> when

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
deficiency in aquaponic systems is when

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:57.350 
deficiency in aquaponic systems is when
they're<00:00:55.309> growing<00:00:56.309> plants<00:00:56.760> that<00:00:57.270> are

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360 
they're growing plants that are

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:59.900 
they're growing plants that are
primarily<00:00:57.890> reproductive<00:00:58.890> producers<00:00:59.699> so

00:00:59.900 --> 00:00:59.910 
primarily reproductive producers so

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:02.930 
primarily reproductive producers so
they're<00:01:00.059> producing<00:01:00.629> fruit<00:01:01.379> seed<00:01:01.859> flour<00:01:02.280> that

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.940 
they're producing fruit seed flour that

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:04.700 
they're producing fruit seed flour that
kind<00:01:03.210> of<00:01:03.300> things<00:01:03.539> things<00:01:03.809> like<00:01:03.899> tomatoes<00:01:04.439> and

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710 
kind of things things like tomatoes and

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:06.440 
kind of things things like tomatoes and
cucumbers<00:01:05.250> things<00:01:05.939> that<00:01:06.090> are<00:01:06.180> kind<00:01:06.360> of

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
cucumbers things that are kind of

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:08.300 
cucumbers things that are kind of
nutrient<00:01:06.960> hogs<00:01:07.229> when<00:01:07.619> it<00:01:07.710> comes<00:01:07.890> to<00:01:08.100> pop

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
nutrient hogs when it comes to pop

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:11.929 
nutrient hogs when it comes to pop
potassium<00:01:09.090> potassium<00:01:09.810> and<00:01:10.409> phosphorus<00:01:11.340> when

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:11.939 
potassium potassium and phosphorus when

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:13.250 
potassium potassium and phosphorus when
they're<00:01:12.090> growing<00:01:12.390> these<00:01:12.540> crops<00:01:12.600> what<00:01:13.080> they'll

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:13.260 
they're growing these crops what they'll

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:15.320 
they're growing these crops what they'll
start<00:01:13.470> to<00:01:13.590> see<00:01:13.740> is<00:01:13.890> a<00:01:13.920> slight<00:01:14.340> phosphorus

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
start to see is a slight phosphorus

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:17.899 
start to see is a slight phosphorus
deficiency<00:01:15.630> in<00:01:16.200> many<00:01:17.189> of<00:01:17.310> their<00:01:17.430> production

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909 
deficiency in many of their production

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:18.200 
deficiency in many of their production
beds

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
beds

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:20.990 
beds
so<00:01:18.540> phosphorus<00:01:19.049> is<00:01:19.320> mostly<00:01:19.860> bioavailable<00:01:20.820> in

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000 
so phosphorus is mostly bioavailable in

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.770 
so phosphorus is mostly bioavailable in
the<00:01:21.119> form<00:01:21.390> of<00:01:21.570> phosphate<00:01:22.409> okay<00:01:22.799> and<00:01:23.040> this<00:01:23.549> is

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:23.780 
the form of phosphate okay and this is

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:30.140 
the form of phosphate okay and this is
po4<00:01:24.780> -<00:01:25.560> -<00:01:26.040> and<00:01:27.829> this<00:01:28.829> molecule<00:01:29.159> floats<00:01:29.970> around

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.150 
po4 - - and this molecule floats around

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:33.410 
po4 - - and this molecule floats around
in<00:01:30.450> solution<00:01:30.780> and<00:01:31.250> it<00:01:32.250> is<00:01:32.490> very<00:01:32.850> very<00:01:33.240> very

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
in solution and it is very very very

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:37.789 
in solution and it is very very very
soluble<00:01:34.380> so<00:01:35.159> it<00:01:35.659> dissolves<00:01:36.659> very<00:01:36.930> easily<00:01:37.380> into

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:37.799 
soluble so it dissolves very easily into

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:40.160 
soluble so it dissolves very easily into
solution<00:01:38.280> but<00:01:38.700> it's<00:01:38.820> also<00:01:39.000> really<00:01:39.360> desirable

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:40.170 
solution but it's also really desirable

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:42.319 
solution but it's also really desirable
a<00:01:40.290> lot<00:01:40.530> of<00:01:40.650> algae<00:01:41.159> really<00:01:41.700> really<00:01:42.060> like

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:42.329 
a lot of algae really really like

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:45.139 
a lot of algae really really like
phosphate<00:01:43.140> and<00:01:43.320> in<00:01:43.500> fact<00:01:43.770> a<00:01:44.159> lot<00:01:44.700> of<00:01:44.729> natural

00:01:45.139 --> 00:01:45.149 
phosphate and in fact a lot of natural

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:47.060 
phosphate and in fact a lot of natural
ecosystems<00:01:45.299> are<00:01:45.990> actually<00:01:46.350> limited<00:01:46.829> by

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:47.070 
ecosystems are actually limited by

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:49.760 
ecosystems are actually limited by
phosphate<00:01:47.700> so<00:01:48.360> as<00:01:48.990> soon<00:01:49.140> as<00:01:49.290> you<00:01:49.380> start<00:01:49.619> adding

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770 
phosphate so as soon as you start adding

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:51.859 
phosphate so as soon as you start adding
phosphorous<00:01:50.460> to<00:01:50.610> the<00:01:50.729> water<00:01:50.909> you'll<00:01:51.390> see<00:01:51.600> big

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869 
phosphorous to the water you'll see big

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:54.740 
phosphorous to the water you'll see big
algae<00:01:52.500> blooms<00:01:52.799> and<00:01:53.159> these<00:01:54.000> big<00:01:54.210> algae<00:01:54.509> blooms

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750 
algae blooms and these big algae blooms

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:56.810 
algae blooms and these big algae blooms
can<00:01:54.930> be<00:01:55.079> very<00:01:55.409> bad<00:01:55.680> for<00:01:55.740> rivers<00:01:56.310> and<00:01:56.520> streams

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:56.820 
can be very bad for rivers and streams

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:00.139 
can be very bad for rivers and streams
lakes<00:01:57.149> and<00:01:57.420> oceans<00:01:57.659> so<00:01:58.619> this<00:01:59.520> is<00:01:59.700> kind<00:01:59.909> of<00:02:00.000> one

00:02:00.139 --> 00:02:00.149 
lakes and oceans so this is kind of one

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:01.280 
lakes and oceans so this is kind of one
of<00:02:00.240> these<00:02:00.329> things<00:02:00.630> that<00:02:00.810> we<00:02:00.899> have<00:02:01.049> to<00:02:01.170> be

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:01.290 
of these things that we have to be

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:03.560 
of these things that we have to be
really<00:02:01.560> careful<00:02:01.770> with<00:02:02.070> in<00:02:02.250> agriculture<00:02:02.850> not

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:03.570 
really careful with in agriculture not

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:05.450 
really careful with in agriculture not
to<00:02:03.719> apply<00:02:03.990> too<00:02:04.049> much<00:02:04.229> simply<00:02:04.890> because<00:02:05.159> it<00:02:05.310> is

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:05.460 
to apply too much simply because it is

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:07.880 
to apply too much simply because it is
soluble<00:02:06.060> it<00:02:06.509> dissolves<00:02:06.990> really<00:02:07.170> easily<00:02:07.710> and

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:07.890 
soluble it dissolves really easily and

it<00:02:07.979> flows<00:02:08.280> away<00:02:08.640> with<00:02:08.819> our<00:02:09.000> runoff<00:02:09.209> in

aquaponic systems that's not as much of
a<00:02:12.120> concern

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:12.900 
a concern

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:14.330 
a concern
but<00:02:13.079> it<00:02:13.170> is<00:02:13.319> nice<00:02:13.530> to<00:02:13.560> know<00:02:13.860> that<00:02:13.890> this<00:02:14.159> is<00:02:14.310> a

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:14.340 
but it is nice to know that this is a

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:16.910 
but it is nice to know that this is a

really precipitate out very often with
the<00:02:19.680> exception<00:02:20.159> of<00:02:20.340> you<00:02:20.970> know<00:02:21.060> very<00:02:21.329> high<00:02:21.659> pH

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:21.900 
the exception of you know very high pH

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:25.009 
the exception of you know very high pH

00:02:25.009 --> 00:02:25.019 
ranges and with very low pH ranges so

00:02:25.019 --> 00:02:27.289 
ranges and with very low pH ranges so
this<00:02:25.230> is<00:02:25.439> typically<00:02:26.129> not<00:02:26.549> something<00:02:27.000> we<00:02:27.120> have

00:02:27.289 --> 00:02:27.299 
this is typically not something we have

00:02:27.299 --> 00:02:29.630 
this is typically not something we have
to<00:02:27.480> worry<00:02:27.659> about<00:02:27.780> however<00:02:28.170> if<00:02:28.709> you<00:02:29.189> do<00:02:29.340> plan<00:02:29.579> on

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:29.640 
to worry about however if you do plan on

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:31.940 
to worry about however if you do plan on
growing<00:02:30.000> tomatoes<00:02:30.439> cucumbers<00:02:31.439> things<00:02:31.799> that

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:31.950 
growing tomatoes cucumbers things that

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:34.640 
growing tomatoes cucumbers things that
are<00:02:32.040> kind<00:02:32.280> of<00:02:32.430> nutrient<00:02:33.329> hogs<00:02:33.510> and<00:02:33.840> and<00:02:34.319> do<00:02:34.620> a

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:34.650 
are kind of nutrient hogs and and do a

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:36.440 
are kind of nutrient hogs and and do a
lot<00:02:34.859> of<00:02:34.890> reproductive<00:02:35.519> growth<00:02:35.909> that<00:02:36.239> is

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:36.450 
lot of reproductive growth that is

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:39.470 
lot of reproductive growth that is
growth<00:02:37.109> of<00:02:37.379> fruits<00:02:37.829> as<00:02:38.129> seeds<00:02:38.670> and<00:02:38.939> flowers

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:39.480 
growth of fruits as seeds and flowers

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:42.559 
growth of fruits as seeds and flowers
then<00:02:40.340> you<00:02:41.340> definitely<00:02:41.519> need<00:02:41.939> to<00:02:41.970> keep<00:02:42.239> an<00:02:42.390> eye

00:02:42.559 --> 00:02:42.569 
then you definitely need to keep an eye

00:02:42.569 --> 00:02:43.940 
then you definitely need to keep an eye
on<00:02:42.840> your<00:02:43.140> phosphate

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:43.950 
on your phosphate

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:45.619 
on your phosphate
now<00:02:44.310> typically<00:02:44.760> when<00:02:44.970> phosphate<00:02:45.480> is

00:02:45.619 --> 00:02:45.629 
now typically when phosphate is

00:02:45.629 --> 00:02:47.240 
now typically when phosphate is
deficient<00:02:45.930> you'll<00:02:46.230> see<00:02:46.440> purpling<00:02:46.980> of<00:02:47.129> the

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:47.250 
deficient you'll see purpling of the

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:50.780 
deficient you'll see purpling of the
leaves<00:02:47.459> and<00:02:48.139> that's<00:02:49.190> that's<00:02:50.190> the<00:02:50.340> most<00:02:50.489> common

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:50.790 
leaves and that's that's the most common

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:54.020 
leaves and that's that's the most common
way<00:02:51.329> to<00:02:51.389> notice<00:02:52.109> phosphate<00:02:52.769> deficiency<00:02:53.030> now

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:54.030 
way to notice phosphate deficiency now

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:56.629 
way to notice phosphate deficiency now
definitely<00:02:54.299> check<00:02:54.720> out<00:02:54.870> a<00:02:55.280> deficiency<00:02:56.280> key

00:02:56.629 --> 00:02:56.639 
definitely check out a deficiency key

00:02:56.639 --> 00:02:58.339 
definitely check out a deficiency key
because<00:02:57.060> there's<00:02:57.269> other<00:02:57.540> symptoms<00:02:58.139> as<00:02:58.319> well

00:02:58.339 --> 00:02:58.349 
because there's other symptoms as well

00:02:58.349 --> 00:03:01.399 
because there's other symptoms as well
but<00:02:59.340> keep<00:03:00.150> an<00:03:00.269> eye<00:03:00.420> out<00:03:00.450> for<00:03:00.599> purpling<00:03:01.230> and

00:03:01.399 --> 00:03:01.409 
but keep an eye out for purpling and

00:03:01.409 --> 00:03:04.610 
but keep an eye out for purpling and
what<00:03:02.400> most<00:03:02.639> most<00:03:03.359> folks<00:03:03.599> don't<00:03:03.840> know<00:03:04.019> is<00:03:04.230> you

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:04.620 
what most most folks don't know is you

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:06.559 
what most most folks don't know is you
often<00:03:05.069> times<00:03:05.220> even<00:03:05.459> in<00:03:05.700> aquaponic<00:03:06.209> systems

00:03:06.559 --> 00:03:06.569 
often times even in aquaponic systems

00:03:06.569 --> 00:03:09.170 
often times even in aquaponic systems
where<00:03:06.720> phosphate<00:03:07.379> isn't<00:03:07.889> showing<00:03:08.879> up<00:03:09.000> as<00:03:09.150> a

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:09.180 
where phosphate isn't showing up as a

where phosphate isn't showing up as a
deficiency<00:03:09.750> on<00:03:10.019> your<00:03:10.200> plants<00:03:10.739> it's<00:03:11.250> often<00:03:11.670> not

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:12.530 
deficiency on your plants it's often not

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:15.349 
deficiency on your plants it's often not
available<00:03:13.530> in<00:03:13.709> high<00:03:14.099> enough<00:03:14.370> amounts<00:03:15.000> to<00:03:15.150> keep

00:03:15.349 --> 00:03:15.359 
available in high enough amounts to keep

00:03:15.359 --> 00:03:17.599 
available in high enough amounts to keep
your<00:03:15.540> plants<00:03:15.959> really<00:03:16.260> producing<00:03:16.949> if<00:03:17.129> you're

00:03:17.599 --> 00:03:17.609 
your plants really producing if you're

00:03:17.609 --> 00:03:20.150 
your plants really producing if you're
growing<00:03:17.879> things<00:03:18.120> like<00:03:18.329> tomatoes<00:03:18.540> so<00:03:19.500> some

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:20.160 
growing things like tomatoes so some

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:21.920 
growing things like tomatoes so some
aquaponics<00:03:20.790> growers<00:03:21.269> may<00:03:21.540> choose<00:03:21.870> to

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:21.930 
aquaponics growers may choose to

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:24.949 
aquaponics growers may choose to
supplement<00:03:22.829> phosphate<00:03:23.549> so<00:03:24.269> what<00:03:24.419> I<00:03:24.449> recommend

00:03:24.949 --> 00:03:24.959 
supplement phosphate so what I recommend

00:03:24.959 --> 00:03:26.180 
supplement phosphate so what I recommend
for<00:03:24.989> folks<00:03:25.290> that<00:03:25.379> want<00:03:25.680> to<00:03:25.769> grow<00:03:26.010> tomatoes

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:26.190 
for folks that want to grow tomatoes

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:27.920 
for folks that want to grow tomatoes
cucumbers<00:03:27.060> some<00:03:27.180> of<00:03:27.299> these<00:03:27.389> fruiting<00:03:27.810> crops

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:27.930 
cucumbers some of these fruiting crops

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:29.689 
cucumbers some of these fruiting crops
is<00:03:28.560> that<00:03:28.799> you<00:03:28.889> actually<00:03:29.010> have<00:03:29.400> two<00:03:29.669> different

00:03:29.689 --> 00:03:29.699 
is that you actually have two different

00:03:29.699 --> 00:03:32.360 
is that you actually have two different
systems<00:03:30.659> you<00:03:31.199> have<00:03:31.379> one<00:03:31.590> system<00:03:31.980> where<00:03:32.190> you're

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:32.370 
systems you have one system where you're

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:34.399 
systems you have one system where you're
willing<00:03:32.699> to<00:03:32.730> supplement<00:03:33.389> some<00:03:33.629> phosphate<00:03:34.199> and

00:03:34.399 --> 00:03:34.409 
willing to supplement some phosphate and

00:03:34.409 --> 00:03:36.680 
willing to supplement some phosphate and
perhaps<00:03:34.590> some<00:03:34.949> more<00:03:35.099> potassium<00:03:35.400> and<00:03:35.879> you<00:03:36.540> have

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:36.690 
perhaps some more potassium and you have

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:38.059 
perhaps some more potassium and you have
another<00:03:36.900> system<00:03:37.319> where<00:03:37.470> you're<00:03:37.620> growing<00:03:37.829> your

00:03:38.059 --> 00:03:38.069 
another system where you're growing your

00:03:38.069 --> 00:03:40.399 
another system where you're growing your
greens<00:03:38.340> and<00:03:38.459> herbs<00:03:38.669> and<00:03:39.000> my<00:03:39.750> reason<00:03:40.109> for<00:03:40.319> that

00:03:40.399 --> 00:03:40.409 
greens and herbs and my reason for that

00:03:40.409 --> 00:03:42.559 
greens and herbs and my reason for that
is<00:03:40.680> that<00:03:40.709> adding<00:03:41.519> potassium<00:03:42.150> and<00:03:42.239> adding

00:03:42.559 --> 00:03:42.569 
is that adding potassium and adding

00:03:42.569 --> 00:03:44.379 
is that adding potassium and adding
phosphate<00:03:43.139> can<00:03:43.620> actually<00:03:44.010> stimulate

00:03:44.379 --> 00:03:44.389 
phosphate can actually stimulate

00:03:44.389 --> 00:03:46.550 
phosphate can actually stimulate
reproductive<00:03:45.389> growth<00:03:45.540> which<00:03:46.169> is<00:03:46.349> something

00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:46.560 
reproductive growth which is something

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:49.819 
reproductive growth which is something
we<00:03:46.799> don't<00:03:47.010> want<00:03:47.370> to<00:03:47.549> do<00:03:47.760> in<00:03:48.090> our<00:03:48.900> vegetative

00:03:49.819 --> 00:03:49.829 
we don't want to do in our vegetative

00:03:49.829 --> 00:03:52.430 
we don't want to do in our vegetative
system<00:03:50.220> so<00:03:50.879> in<00:03:51.209> our<00:03:51.389> reproductive<00:03:51.569> system

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:52.440 
system so in our reproductive system

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:53.719 
system so in our reproductive system
where<00:03:52.590> we're<00:03:52.709> growing<00:03:53.010> tomatoes<00:03:53.190> where<00:03:53.579> we're

00:03:53.719 --> 00:03:53.729 
where we're growing tomatoes where we're

00:03:53.729 --> 00:03:56.390 
where we're growing tomatoes where we're
growing<00:03:54.000> cucumbers<00:03:54.530> one<00:03:55.530> thing<00:03:55.709> we<00:03:55.829> can<00:03:56.010> do<00:03:56.190> is

00:03:56.390 --> 00:03:56.400 
growing cucumbers one thing we can do is

00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:59.629 
growing cucumbers one thing we can do is
actually<00:03:56.669> add<00:03:57.000> a<00:03:57.510> little<00:03:57.989> rock<00:03:58.260> phosphate<00:03:58.639> so

00:03:59.629 --> 00:03:59.639 
actually add a little rock phosphate so

00:03:59.639 --> 00:04:01.819 
actually add a little rock phosphate so
this<00:03:59.790> is<00:03:59.940> a<00:03:59.970> naturally<00:04:00.569> occurring<00:04:00.599> rock<00:04:01.409> form

00:04:01.819 --> 00:04:01.829 
this is a naturally occurring rock form

00:04:01.829 --> 00:04:05.210 
this is a naturally occurring rock form
of<00:04:02.069> phosphate<00:04:02.849> and<00:04:03.229> it<00:04:04.229> typically<00:04:04.739> comes<00:04:05.040> as<00:04:05.190> a

00:04:05.210 --> 00:04:05.220 
of phosphate and it typically comes as a

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:07.399 
of phosphate and it typically comes as a
powder<00:04:05.489> and<00:04:05.879> it's<00:04:06.599> something<00:04:06.989> that<00:04:07.109> you<00:04:07.229> can

00:04:07.399 --> 00:04:07.409 
powder and it's something that you can

00:04:07.409 --> 00:04:10.520 
powder and it's something that you can
break<00:04:08.159> up<00:04:08.400> and<00:04:08.579> add<00:04:09.030> to<00:04:09.209> your<00:04:09.329> system<00:04:09.720> and

00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:10.530 
break up and add to your system and

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:13.969 
break up and add to your system and
relatively<00:04:11.370> small<00:04:11.519> quantities<00:04:11.879> and<00:04:12.979> one

00:04:13.969 --> 00:04:13.979 
relatively small quantities and one

00:04:13.979 --> 00:04:16.699 
relatively small quantities and one
caveat<00:04:14.609> here<00:04:15.180> is<00:04:15.239> that<00:04:15.389> if<00:04:15.690> you<00:04:15.810> do<00:04:15.989> add<00:04:16.289> rock

00:04:16.699 --> 00:04:16.709 
caveat here is that if you do add rock

00:04:16.709 --> 00:04:19.490 
caveat here is that if you do add rock
phosphate<00:04:17.039> to<00:04:17.519> your<00:04:17.669> system<00:04:18.120> make<00:04:19.079> sure<00:04:19.320> you

00:04:19.490 --> 00:04:19.500 
phosphate to your system make sure you

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:23.269 
phosphate to your system make sure you
are<00:04:19.650> shading<00:04:20.220> your<00:04:21.180> fish<00:04:21.810> production<00:04:22.200> part<00:04:23.159> of

00:04:23.269 --> 00:04:23.279 
are shading your fish production part of

00:04:23.279 --> 00:04:26.230 
are shading your fish production part of
the<00:04:23.370> system<00:04:23.729> because<00:04:24.599> what<00:04:24.840> this<00:04:24.990> can<00:04:25.260> do<00:04:25.560> is

00:04:26.230 --> 00:04:26.240 
the system because what this can do is

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:28.330 
the system because what this can do is
actually<00:04:26.509> caused<00:04:26.720> an<00:04:27.080> algae<00:04:27.530> bloom<00:04:27.560> if<00:04:28.039> you're

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:28.340 
actually caused an algae bloom if you're

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:30.909 
actually caused an algae bloom if you're
providing<00:04:29.000> a<00:04:29.090> lot<00:04:29.360> of<00:04:29.389> light<00:04:29.780> to<00:04:30.470> your<00:04:30.620> fish

00:04:30.909 --> 00:04:30.919 
providing a lot of light to your fish

00:04:30.919 --> 00:04:33.159 
providing a lot of light to your fish
and<00:04:31.130> that's<00:04:31.729> something<00:04:32.090> we<00:04:32.210> don't<00:04:32.449> want<00:04:32.810> to<00:04:32.990> do

00:04:33.159 --> 00:04:33.169 
and that's something we don't want to do

00:04:33.169 --> 00:04:35.020 
and that's something we don't want to do
so<00:04:33.889> what<00:04:34.039> we<00:04:34.130> do<00:04:34.280> with<00:04:34.400> this<00:04:34.520> rock<00:04:34.729> phosphate

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:35.030 
so what we do with this rock phosphate

00:04:35.030 --> 00:04:37.510 
so what we do with this rock phosphate
in<00:04:35.449> our<00:04:35.599> reproductive<00:04:36.020> system<00:04:36.770> not<00:04:37.220> in<00:04:37.400> our

00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:37.520 
in our reproductive system not in our

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:39.730 
in our reproductive system not in our
vegetative<00:04:38.150> system<00:04:38.539> is<00:04:38.720> we<00:04:39.229> can<00:04:39.380> take<00:04:39.560> this

00:04:39.730 --> 00:04:39.740 
vegetative system is we can take this

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:41.589 
vegetative system is we can take this
and<00:04:39.919> we<00:04:40.009> can<00:04:40.160> take<00:04:40.280> a<00:04:40.340> very<00:04:40.610> small<00:04:40.789> amount<00:04:41.030> and

00:04:41.589 --> 00:04:41.599 
and we can take a very small amount and

00:04:41.599 --> 00:04:43.839 
and we can take a very small amount and
we<00:04:41.930> can<00:04:42.080> actually<00:04:42.410> sprinkle<00:04:42.830> it<00:04:43.039> on<00:04:43.190> our<00:04:43.610> grow

00:04:43.839 --> 00:04:43.849 
we can actually sprinkle it on our grow

00:04:43.849 --> 00:04:45.969 
we can actually sprinkle it on our grow
bed<00:04:44.090> and<00:04:44.300> what<00:04:44.870> this<00:04:45.020> does<00:04:45.229> is<00:04:45.470> it<00:04:45.590> acts<00:04:45.770> as

00:04:45.969 --> 00:04:45.979 
bed and what this does is it acts as

00:04:45.979 --> 00:04:48.370 
bed and what this does is it acts as
kind<00:04:46.130> of<00:04:46.310> a<00:04:46.370> slow<00:04:46.639> release<00:04:47.060> fertilizer<00:04:47.930> that

00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:48.380 
kind of a slow release fertilizer that

00:04:48.380 --> 00:04:50.770 
kind of a slow release fertilizer that
starts<00:04:48.710> releasing<00:04:49.120> phosphate<00:04:50.120> into<00:04:50.449> the<00:04:50.569> root

00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:50.780 
starts releasing phosphate into the root

00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:53.200 
starts releasing phosphate into the root
zone<00:04:50.810> of<00:04:51.259> our<00:04:51.620> grow<00:04:51.860> bed<00:04:52.099> now<00:04:52.669> it's<00:04:52.849> important

00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:53.210 
zone of our grow bed now it's important

00:04:53.210 --> 00:04:54.700 
zone of our grow bed now it's important
to<00:04:53.270> sprinkle<00:04:53.630> this<00:04:53.780> kind<00:04:54.020> of<00:04:54.139> along<00:04:54.349> the<00:04:54.500> top

00:04:54.700 --> 00:04:54.710 
to sprinkle this kind of along the top

00:04:54.710 --> 00:04:58.480 
to sprinkle this kind of along the top
and<00:04:54.979> make<00:04:55.610> sure<00:04:55.849> that<00:04:56.000> you're<00:04:56.180> not<00:04:57.490> over

00:04:58.480 --> 00:04:58.490 
and make sure that you're not over

00:04:58.490 --> 00:05:02.409 
and make sure that you're not over
irrigating<00:04:59.419> your<00:04:59.569> grow<00:04:59.900> beds<00:05:00.139> and<00:05:00.849> ideally<00:05:01.849> if

00:05:02.409 --> 00:05:02.419 
irrigating your grow beds and ideally if

00:05:02.419 --> 00:05:03.879 
irrigating your grow beds and ideally if
you<00:05:02.509> add<00:05:02.810> this<00:05:03.020> a<00:05:03.050> kind<00:05:03.409> of<00:05:03.590> the<00:05:03.680> right<00:05:03.860> amount

00:05:03.879 --> 00:05:03.889 
you add this a kind of the right amount

00:05:03.889 --> 00:05:06.879 
you add this a kind of the right amount
what<00:05:04.759> you<00:05:04.880> end<00:05:05.060> up<00:05:05.210> with<00:05:05.449> is<00:05:05.659> a<00:05:06.139> kind<00:05:06.590> of<00:05:06.680> this

00:05:06.879 --> 00:05:06.889 
what you end up with is a kind of this

00:05:06.889 --> 00:05:08.770

tower<00:05:22.069> systems<00:05:22.759> we<00:05:23.539> recommend<00:05:24.020> actually

00:05:24.430 --> 00:05:24.440 
tower systems we recommend actually

00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:28.629 
tower systems we recommend actually
adding<00:05:24.860> this<00:05:25.069> to<00:05:25.490> the<00:05:25.880> solution<00:05:27.340> either<00:05:28.340> in

your sump tank or in one of your fish
sub<00:05:30.650> systems<00:05:31.130> so<00:05:31.759> what<00:05:32.240> we<00:05:32.389> do<00:05:32.599> is<00:05:32.719> we<00:05:32.840> actually

00:05:33.159 --> 00:05:33.169 
sub systems so what we do is we actually

00:05:33.169 --> 00:05:34.950 
sub systems so what we do is we actually
take<00:05:33.320> some<00:05:33.560> of<00:05:33.590> this<00:05:33.770> and<00:05:33.979> we<00:05:34.039> drop<00:05:34.310> it<00:05:34.490> into

00:05:34.950 --> 00:05:34.960 
take some of this and we drop it into

00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:38.140 
take some of this and we drop it into
one<00:05:35.960> of<00:05:36.080> our<00:05:36.229> mineralization<00:05:36.830> tanks<00:05:37.430> it's<00:05:37.909> a

00:05:38.140 --> 00:05:38.150 
one of our mineralization tanks it's a

00:05:38.150 --> 00:05:40.450 
one of our mineralization tanks it's a
we're<00:05:39.020> actually<00:05:39.169> raising<00:05:39.680> fish<00:05:39.889> in<00:05:40.070> it<00:05:40.190> but<00:05:40.370> it

00:05:40.450 --> 00:05:40.460 
we're actually raising fish in it but it

00:05:40.460 --> 00:05:42.219 
we're actually raising fish in it but it
is<00:05:40.610> kind<00:05:40.909> of<00:05:41.090> it's<00:05:41.360> a<00:05:41.479> settlement<00:05:41.810> /

00:05:42.219 --> 00:05:42.229 
is kind of it's a settlement /

00:05:42.229 --> 00:05:44.469 
is kind of it's a settlement /
mineralization<00:05:42.800> tank<00:05:43.190> will<00:05:43.639> drop<00:05:43.909> it<00:05:44.090> down<00:05:44.210> in

00:05:44.469 --> 00:05:44.479 
mineralization tank will drop it down in

00:05:44.479 --> 00:05:45.670 
mineralization tank will drop it down in
there<00:05:44.659> and<00:05:44.840> that<00:05:44.960> will<00:05:45.110> slow<00:05:45.349> release

00:05:45.670 --> 00:05:45.680 
there and that will slow release

00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:48.490 
there and that will slow release
phosphate<00:05:46.219> to<00:05:46.580> our<00:05:46.729> system<00:05:47.120> and<00:05:47.719> it's<00:05:48.440> a

00:05:48.490 --> 00:05:48.500 
phosphate to our system and it's a

00:05:48.500 --> 00:05:50.830 
phosphate to our system and it's a
really<00:05:48.740> nice<00:05:48.949> supplement<00:05:49.880> if<00:05:50.060> you<00:05:50.120> are

00:05:50.830 --> 00:05:50.840 
really nice supplement if you are

00:05:50.840 --> 00:05:53.589 
really nice supplement if you are
struggling<00:05:51.199> with<00:05:52.070> a<00:05:52.099> phosphate<00:05:53.090> production

00:05:53.589 --> 00:05:53.599 
struggling with a phosphate production

00:05:53.599 --> 00:05:57.670 
struggling with a phosphate production
now<00:05:53.870> I<00:05:54.860> will<00:05:55.340> say<00:05:55.580> that<00:05:55.819> the<00:05:55.969> phosphate<00:05:56.680> rating

00:05:57.670 --> 00:05:57.680 
now I will say that the phosphate rating

00:05:57.680 --> 00:06:01.029 
now I will say that the phosphate rating
is<00:05:58.219> lower<00:05:58.729> typically<00:05:59.630> than<00:06:00.169> potassium<00:06:00.530> or

00:06:01.029 --> 00:06:01.039 
is lower typically than potassium or

00:06:01.039 --> 00:06:03.070 
is lower typically than potassium or
nitrogen<00:06:01.550> so<00:06:01.969> you<00:06:02.090> don't<00:06:02.479> need<00:06:02.719> to<00:06:02.900> add<00:06:03.050> a

00:06:03.070 --> 00:06:03.080 
nitrogen so you don't need to add a

00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:05.469 
nitrogen so you don't need to add a
whole<00:06:03.469> lot<00:06:03.740> of<00:06:03.889> this<00:06:04.009> stuff<00:06:04.310> but<00:06:05.180> the<00:06:05.330> nice

00:06:05.469 --> 00:06:05.479 
whole lot of this stuff but the nice

00:06:05.479 --> 00:06:07.360 
whole lot of this stuff but the nice
thing<00:06:05.659> about<00:06:05.690> rock<00:06:06.380> phosphate<00:06:06.680> is<00:06:07.190> that

00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:07.370 
thing about rock phosphate is that

00:06:07.370 --> 00:06:08.950 
thing about rock phosphate is that
unless<00:06:07.520> you're<00:06:07.819> adding<00:06:08.150> relatively<00:06:08.630> obscene

00:06:08.950 --> 00:06:08.960 
unless you're adding relatively obscene

00:06:08.960 --> 00:06:11.260 
unless you're adding relatively obscene
quantities<00:06:09.500> you're<00:06:10.460> not<00:06:10.610> going<00:06:10.849> to<00:06:10.909> do<00:06:11.240> a

00:06:11.260 --> 00:06:11.270 
quantities you're not going to do a

00:06:11.270 --> 00:06:12.820 
quantities you're not going to do a
whole<00:06:11.479> lot<00:06:11.509> of<00:06:11.750> damage<00:06:11.930> to<00:06:12.199> your<00:06:12.259> system<00:06:12.469> it's

00:06:12.820 --> 00:06:12.830 
whole lot of damage to your system it's

00:06:12.830 --> 00:06:16.330 
whole lot of damage to your system it's
a<00:06:12.949> nice<00:06:13.159> simple<00:06:14.830> way<00:06:15.830> to<00:06:15.860> supplement

00:06:16.330 --> 00:06:16.340 
a nice simple way to supplement

00:06:16.340 --> 00:06:18.990 
a nice simple way to supplement
phosphate<00:06:17.120> and<00:06:17.330> a<00:06:17.659> lot<00:06:17.840> of<00:06:17.870> aquaponic<00:06:18.530> systems

00:06:18.990 --> 00:06:19.000 
phosphate and a lot of aquaponic systems

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:22.149 
phosphate and a lot of aquaponic systems
so<00:06:20.000> for<00:06:20.270> an<00:06:20.360> example<00:06:20.900> of<00:06:21.169> kind<00:06:21.590> of<00:06:21.710> the<00:06:21.830> amount

00:06:22.149 --> 00:06:22.159 
so for an example of kind of the amount

00:06:22.159 --> 00:06:24.790 
so for an example of kind of the amount
that<00:06:22.250> you<00:06:22.460> should<00:06:22.639> be<00:06:22.759> adding<00:06:23.440> for<00:06:24.440> your<00:06:24.590> kind

00:06:24.790 --> 00:06:24.800 
that you should be adding for your kind

00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:27.249 
that you should be adding for your kind
of<00:06:24.919> typical<00:06:25.340> IBC<00:06:25.909> system<00:06:26.360> I<00:06:26.599> would<00:06:26.960> take<00:06:27.110> about

00:06:27.249 --> 00:06:27.259 
of typical IBC system I would take about

00:06:27.259 --> 00:06:29.350 
of typical IBC system I would take about
that<00:06:27.590> much<00:06:27.830> rock<00:06:28.069> phosphate<00:06:28.370> that's<00:06:28.849> probably

00:06:29.350 --> 00:06:29.360 
that much rock phosphate that's probably

00:06:29.360 --> 00:06:32.890 
that much rock phosphate that's probably
about<00:06:29.569> an<00:06:30.319> ounce<00:06:30.680> of<00:06:31.069> rock<00:06:31.699> phosphate<00:06:32.000> and<00:06:32.840> I

00:06:32.890 --> 00:06:32.900 
about an ounce of rock phosphate and I

00:06:32.900 --> 00:06:34.450 
about an ounce of rock phosphate and I
would<00:06:33.020> crush<00:06:33.289> it<00:06:33.469> up<00:06:33.590> and<00:06:33.830> I<00:06:33.979> would<00:06:34.130> kind<00:06:34.370> of

00:06:34.450 --> 00:06:34.460 
would crush it up and I would kind of

00:06:34.460 --> 00:06:38.350 
would crush it up and I would kind of
sprinkle<00:06:35.000> about<00:06:35.120> half<00:06:35.570> of<00:06:35.719> it<00:06:35.979> around<00:06:37.150> the<00:06:38.150> top

00:06:38.350 --> 00:06:38.360 
sprinkle about half of it around the top

00:06:38.360 --> 00:06:39.610 
sprinkle about half of it around the top
of<00:06:38.539> the<00:06:38.599> girl<00:06:38.810> better<00:06:38.990> notice<00:06:39.320> set

00:06:39.610 --> 00:06:39.620 
of the girl better notice set

00:06:39.620 --> 00:06:41.230 
of the girl better notice set
side<00:06:39.740> the<00:06:39.889> other<00:06:40.010> half<00:06:40.280> I<00:06:40.520> would<00:06:40.729> watch<00:06:40.970> the

00:06:41.230 --> 00:06:41.240 
side the other half I would watch the

00:06:41.240 --> 00:06:43.300 
side the other half I would watch the
system<00:06:41.449> really<00:06:41.870> carefully<00:06:42.380> and<00:06:42.560> make<00:06:43.280> sure

00:06:43.300 --> 00:06:43.310 
system really carefully and make sure

00:06:43.310 --> 00:06:45.430 
system really carefully and make sure
that<00:06:43.639> you<00:06:43.760> don't<00:06:43.910> stimulate<00:06:44.690> an<00:06:45.050> algae<00:06:45.410> bloom

00:06:45.430 --> 00:06:45.440 
that you don't stimulate an algae bloom

00:06:45.440 --> 00:06:47.230 
that you don't stimulate an algae bloom
now<00:06:46.100> you<00:06:46.160> should<00:06:46.340> see<00:06:46.520> a<00:06:46.550> response<00:06:46.970> in<00:06:47.150> your

00:06:47.230 --> 00:06:47.240 
now you should see a response in your

00:06:47.240 --> 00:06:49.360 
now you should see a response in your
plants<00:06:47.810> within<00:06:48.320> the<00:06:48.530> first<00:06:48.770> week<00:06:49.100> or<00:06:49.280> two

00:06:49.360 --> 00:06:49.370 
plants within the first week or two

00:06:49.370 --> 00:06:53.110 
plants within the first week or two
weeks<00:06:49.850> and<00:06:51.220> if<00:06:52.220> you're<00:06:52.490> growing<00:06:52.850> tomatoes

00:06:53.110 --> 00:06:53.120 
weeks and if you're growing tomatoes

00:06:53.120 --> 00:06:55.689 
weeks and if you're growing tomatoes
something<00:06:53.810> like<00:06:53.960> that<00:06:54.169> you'll<00:06:54.380> find<00:06:54.710> that

00:06:55.689 --> 00:06:55.699 
something like that you'll find that

00:06:55.699 --> 00:06:57.939 
something like that you'll find that
they<00:06:55.880> require<00:06:56.260> additions<00:06:57.260> on<00:06:57.470> a<00:06:57.530> regular

00:06:57.939 --> 00:06:57.949 
they require additions on a regular

00:06:57.949 --> 00:07:00.219 
they require additions on a regular
basis<00:06:58.400> and<00:06:58.580> if<00:06:58.790> you<00:06:58.940> are<00:06:59.120> adding<00:06:59.660> rock

00:07:00.219 --> 00:07:00.229 
basis and if you are adding rock

00:07:00.229 --> 00:07:02.260 
basis and if you are adding rock
phosphate<00:07:00.550> appropriately<00:07:01.550> to<00:07:01.729> your<00:07:01.850> system

00:07:02.260 --> 00:07:02.270 
phosphate appropriately to your system

00:07:02.270 --> 00:07:04.780 
phosphate appropriately to your system
you<00:07:02.750> will<00:07:02.870> definitely<00:07:03.410> see<00:07:03.560> a<00:07:03.590> bump<00:07:03.979> in<00:07:04.220> your

00:07:04.780 --> 00:07:04.790 
you will definitely see a bump in your

00:07:04.790 --> 00:07:08.500 
you will definitely see a bump in your
tomato<00:07:05.150> and/or<00:07:05.960> cucumber<00:07:06.620> eggplant<00:07:07.340> any<00:07:08.150> kind

00:07:10.810 --> 00:07:10.820 
of rooting for crop production so you

00:07:10.820 --> 00:07:12.490 
of rooting for crop production so you
can<00:07:10.940> find<00:07:11.180> rock<00:07:11.389> phosphate<00:07:11.630> online<00:07:12.199> if<00:07:12.380> you're

00:07:12.490 --> 00:07:12.500 
can find rock phosphate online if you're

00:07:12.500 --> 00:07:14.529 
can find rock phosphate online if you're
