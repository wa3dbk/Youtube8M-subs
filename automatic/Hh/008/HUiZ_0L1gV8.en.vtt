00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.640
 and staff with absolute certainty that more 

00:00:02.939 --> 00:00:07.620
 received in the history of my channel was like 

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:10.200
 You record your ipad 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:13.410
 so today I finally make a video 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:15.900
 It's showing a focker I use to 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:18.029
 record the screen of my haiti vai 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:20.100
 his name is display reminds of you 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:22.439
 need to have a feed to run 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:24.660
 this means that you need to have 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:26.760
 jailbreak your device more 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:29.130
 I do not remember head specs that 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:31.679
 the radio must be able to rotate 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:34.770
 I know I only have it on irs but I'll leave it 

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:36.329
 they in the description a link for you to see 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:37.980
 more detailed movies 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:39.480
 It took me a long time to do this 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:42.329
 video because I stood with one foot behind 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:45.570
 to record something about what 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:48.629
 involved eyelash software as well as 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:51.570
 I did a research and I saw that today the 

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:54.230
 bê that is legal is not prohibited by law 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:57.270
 nor anything common in the United States and 

00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:58.800
 so I finally decided to record it 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:01.340
 then the first thing you 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:04.710
 need to enter that is not 

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:06.720
 load Rapidão Tosando here ipod 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:09.299
 climate that is not as potent as 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:13.590
 It was an ipad, the son did well and today, well. 

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:16.409
 easy on your version 6.1 1.3 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:19.409
 I suggest you do too because it will 

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:21.659
 releasing your cd is going to leave you 

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:24.990
 will use twitter a lot of things in 

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:28.080
 Time to apple a bug but that's okay 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:30.960
 to make cmed that in the bottom corner 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:34.369
 right will you find this screen 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:37.350
 here you will strive to add a partner 

00:01:34.369 --> 00:01:40.799
 and goes here to teach you will avoid 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:43.979
 add there you type whatever you want 

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:45.960
 thing is but here you add I will 

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:49.229
 leave in the application is this here 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:51.990
 first you see big boss and her 

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:55.350
 You'll find it with a display that remembers 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:59.490
 this is the lawful way of taking a 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:02:02.930
 that the request is not asked at the time it costs 5 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:06.390
 dollars is a fair price for the guys who 

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:08.849
 They did a good job, everything works. 

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:11.770
 well with me and I will remember here that 

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:13.900
 You're talking about a record. 

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:17.920
 if you want but I do not remember is to record 

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:19.930
 the audio I have a record mode view 

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:22.000
 This has not worked for me. 

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:25.300
 rafael became very large and became 

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:28.780
 You can but that's it, I bought this one. 

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:31.390
 This is what I did on my ipad and 

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:33.850
 It was worth more because it is a pe 

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:38.350
 Legal decided to do the same. 

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:42.580
 only now he puts on the pirate hat and 

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:44.860
 Is there a way to get started? 

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:46.270
 which is with an alternative source that I 

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:49.720
 I'll show you 

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:56.820
 this quiches celise this penultimate here 

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:59.590
 that low talk because I bought in my 

00:02:56.820 --> 00:03:00.550
 ipad only I'm using ipod of my 

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:02.170
 cousin 

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:04.600
 I will not pay twice for the same 

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:08.110
 thing to pay $ 5 just to do this 

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:09.760
 video so I did a little research 

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:12.370
 I'll leave it for you to work here. 

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:15.280
 I just like that too, but it's pretty easy to guess. 

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:18.730
 that pt point x they are something like this 

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:20.500
 That's it, and getting there, you go. 

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:24.640
 need to come here display site 

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:28.120
 collect the blue will be the official 

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:31.450
 what you should theoretically count on 

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:33.220
 or from below will be the pirate only 

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:38.830
 works the same way totally for 

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:39.910
 record another one now more then that 

00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:41.770
 you do 

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:42.790
 I'm going to give a moralist here I'm not going 

00:03:41.770 --> 00:03:46.030
 play you 

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:47.950
 But okay, then, if you get attached, it will. 

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:49.630
 it's working this is not going 

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:51.400
 can show the kids a lot here 

00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:53.470
 because I 'm recording here I can not 

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:55.510
 While I'm recording, I'm going to 

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:59.260
 show that some configurations some 

00:03:55.510 --> 00:04:01.720
 if it fits here it is then go 

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:03.040
 It's okay, I 'm already here, it's open. 

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:05.890
 unintentionally because I was already thinking 

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:08.680
 on record hangs here for a while 

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:11.050
 will have here the display reminds you that 

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:13.360
 to have ahead for those who do not know is the 

00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:15.610
 frames per second up to the video I do not 

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:17.890
 wiggled did I forget you but to tinker 

00:04:15.610 --> 00:04:19.810
 is not left fell Locke to not wobble 

00:04:17.890 --> 00:04:22.060
 much during the video here has 

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:23.880
 orientation of your video always leaves 

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:27.810
 here in this zin pattern 

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:29.370
 will he record it in the guideline that 

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:31.530
 you are in the moment 

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:35.190
 there is the format of the video I always 

00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:37.860
 leaving the one here because the smped 

00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:41.220
 he worked with me there as I spake 

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:44.100
 range with very large poly and 

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:46.920
 Microphone I do not like my hotel very much. 

00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:48.660
 even to record the quality of the 

00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:49.260
 video is not always so 

00:04:48.660 --> 00:04:53.190
 lightning 

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:55.130
 This is the project I do not really remember. 

00:04:53.190 --> 00:04:58.800
 I do not remember more going on the official website 

00:04:55.130 --> 00:05:01.350
 between quotation marks and leave in the inscription 

00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:03.900
 hey, he earns it to leave white black 

00:05:01.350 --> 00:05:06.420
 that's what I leave the fool to stay 

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:08.940
 whole pepsi show this is for 

00:05:06.420 --> 00:05:12.210
 show patients are coming in this 

00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:15.420
 Now, that little finger is kind of boring, but it's 

00:05:12.210 --> 00:05:17.580
 good to show the tutorial and you talk 

00:05:15.420 --> 00:05:18.930
 You just want to become aggravated, it 's always 

00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:23.820
 or if you do not simply show 

00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:28.680
 machines appeared hugo now appeared to 

00:05:23.820 --> 00:05:32.010
 its giant mall size leaving medium 

00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:34.800
 even if that's the way you look 

00:05:32.010 --> 00:05:37.800
 this being a member of what is 

00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:40.740
 exactly but it reminds you that there is some 

00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:43.890
 tape on the deal you can get it 

00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:45.870

00:05:43.890 --> 00:05:48.120
 Can you get the video through 

00:05:45.870 --> 00:05:50.760
 computer or any other device 

00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:53.130
 connected to a wifi but that is 

00:05:50.760 --> 00:05:55.440

 I never got out of direct effect. 

00:06:00.060 --> 00:06:05.220
 I just do not do it because I like 

00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:07.020
 to believe 10 but then these people 

00:06:05.220 --> 00:06:11.480
 I think there's nothing more to talk about. 

00:06:07.020 --> 00:06:15.150
 This is it, you're going to record your game place. 

00:06:11.480 --> 00:06:19.970
 sorry for the delay of the video I did not 

00:06:15.150 --> 00:06:22.590
 I see a lot of it here but you can 

00:06:19.970 --> 00:06:24.810
 leave some doubt and run is something 

00:06:22.590 --> 00:06:28.110
