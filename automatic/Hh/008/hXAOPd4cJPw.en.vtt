you one coal and it's actually a bit
difficult<00:00:27.779> even<00:00:28.260> though<00:00:28.439> it<00:00:28.560> seems<00:00:28.830> really

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:28.949 
difficult even though it seems really

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:34.100 
difficult even though it seems really
simple<00:00:29.750> i'm<00:00:30.750> using<00:00:31.230> hypercam<00:00:31.920> two<00:00:32.250> and<00:00:33.110> a

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:34.110

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
but it never went up because this

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:56.900 
but it never went up because this
program<00:00:55.500> really<00:00:55.530> sucked<00:00:56.039> and<00:00:56.280> it<00:00:56.340> lagged<00:00:56.610> my

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910 
program really sucked and it lagged my

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:59.150 
program really sucked and it lagged my
game<00:00:57.149> the<00:00:57.390> crap<00:00:57.690> and<00:00:57.960> i<00:00:58.020> couldn't<00:00:58.320> i<00:00:58.500> could

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:43.310 

here<00:01:40.020> you<00:01:40.200> can<00:01:40.380> see<00:01:41.000> this<00:01:42.000> is<00:01:42.270> like<00:01:42.750> a<00:01:42.990> dart

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.320 
here you can see this is like a dart

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:45.679 
here you can see this is like a dart
board<00:01:43.549> except<00:01:44.549> you<00:01:44.640> can't<00:01:44.850> see<00:01:45.000> any<00:01:45.150> points<00:01:45.540> on

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:45.689 
board except you can't see any points on

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:48.050 
board except you can't see any points on
it<00:01:45.720> the<00:01:46.320> goal<00:01:46.530> is<00:01:46.680> to<00:01:46.799> hit<00:01:46.920> this<00:01:47.159> obsidium<00:01:47.880> in

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060 
it the goal is to hit this obsidium in

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:50.210 
it the goal is to hit this obsidium in
the<00:01:48.149> middle<00:01:48.420> and<00:01:48.600> the<00:01:49.500> good<00:01:49.680> thing<00:01:49.799> about<00:01:49.860> this

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:50.220 
the middle and the good thing about this

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:55.039 
the middle and the good thing about this
is<00:01:50.280> if<00:01:51.210> you<00:01:51.630> use<00:01:51.659> your<00:01:51.930> bow<00:01:52.110> and<00:01:52.439> shoot<00:01:52.470> a<00:01:54.049> bunch

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:55.049 
is if you use your bow and shoot a bunch

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:58.010 
is if you use your bow and shoot a bunch
of<00:01:55.200> arrows<00:01:55.380> after<00:01:56.220> you're<00:01:56.399> done<00:01:56.899> walk<00:01:57.899> right

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020 
of arrows after you're done walk right

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:00.770 
of arrows after you're done walk right
next<00:01:58.350> to<00:01:58.409> it<00:01:58.500> and<00:01:58.680> you<00:01:59.490> can<00:01:59.670> reclaim<00:01:59.940> them<00:02:00.210> see

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:00.780 
next to it and you can reclaim them see

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:04.090 
next to it and you can reclaim them see
you<00:02:00.960> have<00:02:01.110> 40<00:02:01.500> arrows<00:02:01.649> again<00:02:02.390> so<00:02:03.390> basically

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:04.100 
you have 40 arrows again so basically

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:06.560 
you have 40 arrows again so basically
i'm<00:02:05.100> gonna<00:02:05.250> show<00:02:05.580> those<00:02:05.700> sheep<00:02:06.000> up<00:02:06.210> first

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:06.570 
i'm gonna show those sheep up first

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:07.910 
i'm gonna show those sheep up first
because<00:02:06.869> they're<00:02:07.500> probably<00:02:07.740> getting

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:07.920 
because they're probably getting

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:09.680 
because they're probably getting
annoying<00:02:08.220> if<00:02:08.519> you<00:02:08.849> can<00:02:09.000> even<00:02:09.119> hear<00:02:09.330> them<00:02:09.479> i

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:09.690 
annoying if you can even hear them i

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:13.479 
annoying if you can even hear them i
guess<00:02:10.470> she'll<00:02:10.800> crack<00:02:11.069> shut<00:02:11.519> the<00:02:11.670> hell<00:02:11.940> up

00:02:13.479 --> 00:02:13.489 
guess she'll crack shut the hell up

00:02:13.489 --> 00:02:20.030 
guess she'll crack shut the hell up
slaughter<00:02:14.489> ok<00:02:16.819> ok<00:02:17.819> now<00:02:17.940> but<00:02:18.180> again<00:02:18.620> so<00:02:19.620> all<00:02:19.950> you

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:31.560 
let's see how bad I do the only problem

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:34.880 
let's see how bad I do the only problem
about<00:02:31.980> this<00:02:32.250> is<00:02:33.260> let<00:02:34.260> me<00:02:34.319> just<00:02:34.500> lower<00:02:34.590> the<00:02:34.739> one

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:34.890 
about this is let me just lower the one

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:38.110 
about this is let me just lower the one
the<00:02:35.549> only<00:02:35.580> bad<00:02:35.880> thing<00:02:35.910> about<00:02:36.120> this<00:02:36.680> course<00:02:37.680> is

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:38.120 
the only bad thing about this course is

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:40.940 
the only bad thing about this course is
when<00:02:39.120> you<00:02:39.269> turn<00:02:39.540> in<00:02:39.750> the<00:02:39.870> mine<00:02:40.049> cart<00:02:40.319> as<00:02:40.590> some

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:40.950 
when you turn in the mine cart as some

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:43.009 
when you turn in the mine cart as some
of<00:02:41.069> you<00:02:41.190> already<00:02:41.250> know<00:02:41.610> it<00:02:42.060> automatically

00:02:43.009 --> 00:02:43.019 
of you already know it automatically

00:02:43.019 --> 00:02:46.310 
of you already know it automatically
moves<00:02:43.440> your<00:02:43.859> view<00:02:44.640> so<00:02:45.510> it's<00:02:45.660> really<00:02:45.959> hard<00:02:46.200> to

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:46.320 
moves your view so it's really hard to

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:48.349 
moves your view so it's really hard to
aim<00:02:46.470> for<00:02:46.829> more<00:02:47.489> than<00:02:47.579> like<00:02:47.730> two<00:02:47.910> seconds

00:02:48.349 --> 00:02:48.359 
aim for more than like two seconds

00:02:48.359 --> 00:02:52.099 
aim for more than like two seconds
because<00:02:48.540> it<00:02:48.720> keeps<00:02:48.810> switching<00:02:50.660> so<00:02:51.660> we'll<00:02:51.930> see

00:02:52.099 --> 00:02:52.109 
because it keeps switching so we'll see

00:02:52.109 --> 00:02:55.670 
because it keeps switching so we'll see
how<00:02:52.140> many<00:02:52.500> out<00:02:52.739> of<00:02:52.769> 40<00:02:53.630> hit<00:02:54.630> near<00:02:54.900> the<00:02:54.930> Obsidian
