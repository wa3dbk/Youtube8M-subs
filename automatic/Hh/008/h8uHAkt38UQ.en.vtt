00:00:09.159 --> 00:00:10.989
 the Skoda Octavia 

00:00:10.989 --> 00:00:14.949
 The Czech park Diesel is more popular than ever before in Germany 

00:00:14.949 --> 00:00:18.970
 One more reason for the engine vision lasts twelve months is the Skoda 

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:22.899
 Octavia two grief 0 TFSI with four-wheel drive in the tough Relations 

00:00:22.899 --> 00:00:25.899
 Be use 

00:00:31.369 --> 00:00:34.810
 first stop it each that takes the ADAC performance check 

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:45.930
 150 hp should make the second man Ole s SG engine, according to Skoda in the test can 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:48.330
 the Octavia even pack four more horsepower 

00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:51.670
 Shock absorbers and brakes are perfect so from and for 

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:54.670
 long-haul driver 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:02.080
 Winter 2005 stand of all kinds with haldex clutch are themselves 

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:05.370
 snow-covered roads no problem for the practical Czechs 

00:01:05.370 --> 00:01:08.960
 He is fast becoming a popular productions for editors and camera teams 

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:09.690
 vehicle 

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:12.910
 the engine has enough power the suspension swallows one or the other 

00:01:12.910 --> 00:01:15.910
 Pothole and convinces with directional stability 

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:29.860
 580 liters of cargo space are available folded down 1000 620 with Philip Reid 

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:32.680
 There will be bands on the back seats 

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:36.720
 If you order white or the four by four variant, chassis 23 grows 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:40.210
 Millimeter in height so our team can sometimes off the road 

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:41.570
 take a stand 

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:45.700
 Towbar is thanks to the Octavia also as a caravan towing vehicle 

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:46.540
 commitment 

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:51.330
 a maximum of 1000 500 kg trailer load can drag the Czech behind 

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:55.080
 however, that the rings require torque of a maximum of 200 Newton meters 

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:59.090
 nevertheless the caravan editor of the Octavia is convinced to high speed 

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:03.320
 generic 

00:02:04.479 --> 00:02:08.069
 For one thing, it's a family coach, five people are allowed on the car 

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:11.239
 interrupted large trunk is to put 

00:02:11.239 --> 00:02:12.929
 you should avoid that 

00:02:12.929 --> 00:02:16.069
 Elena wanted to use this whatever 

00:02:16.069 --> 00:02:20.709
 somewhere to frost were no problem 4 times 4 Brunner was history 

00:02:21.439 --> 00:02:25.549
 Crisscross Germany leads the persistence as it comes up in 

00:02:25.549 --> 00:02:26.379
 Tyrol 

00:02:26.379 --> 00:02:29.870
 Unfortunately, the Navi was not overwhelmed with roads knew and switched 

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:32.870
 just off 

00:02:37.589 --> 00:02:40.650
 the good workmanship and clarity takes over the Skoda 

00:02:40.649 --> 00:02:41.669
 from VW 

00:02:41.669 --> 00:02:46.779
 In addition we afford an automatic climate control for 390 euros extra a glass sliding roof 

00:02:46.779 --> 00:02:48.849
 for 770 euros 

00:02:48.849 --> 00:02:51.849
 as the leather interior for just under 2000 euros 

00:02:56.909 --> 00:02:59.909
 a trailer hitch for 520 euros and 

00:03:03.399 --> 00:03:09.009
 Xenon headlight for 790 euros total over 6000 euros extra stuck 

00:03:09.009 --> 00:03:10.529
 in our it takes approx 

00:03:10.529 --> 00:03:14.969
 so our Octavia one loosely costs 30 thousand euros for a fair price of 

00:03:14.969 --> 00:03:19.549
 Entry price for the 2 0 TFSI four times Philipp at 24 thousand 190 

00:03:26.419 --> 00:03:30.019
 The leather seats are really comfortable steering, especially on long distances 

00:03:30.019 --> 00:03:34.049
 precise and the curve behavior but slightly spongy but the display shows 

00:03:34.049 --> 00:03:36.239
 If necessary, the driver walks 

00:03:36.239 --> 00:03:40.260
 The Czech transports a maximum of 600 kilos and the engine has too little 

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:42.479
 Namely torque 200 Newton meters 

00:03:42.479 --> 00:03:45.709
 which DSL 3500 revolutions are available 

00:03:46.769 --> 00:03:50.809
 on our well 35 thousand the toilet with a sect Škoda Octavia as 

00:03:50.809 --> 00:03:52.219
 service provider and 

00:03:52.219 --> 00:03:56.389
 loyal companions proved Hesse unspectacular car but one 

00:03:57.139 --> 00:04:00.569
 Hawthorne's tools that's exactly what he should say 

00:04:00.569 --> 00:04:02.429
 Of course it is always traveling 

00:04:02.429 --> 00:04:07.359
 the entire vw group unrivaled single deficit the only 

00:04:07.359 --> 00:04:10.729
 Fuel consumption of his thesis high in it had to constantly keep on speed 

00:04:10.729 --> 00:04:15.749
 especially if you pull heavy loads she now wagon or trailer then flew 

00:04:15.749 --> 00:04:18.749
 really strong 

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:24.530
 48 thousand 75 kilometers come together at the end of the test 

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:27.069
 much of it on the highway 

00:04:27.069 --> 00:04:31.669
 at full throttle, 15 liters of fuel were not uncommon in the SSC engine 

00:04:31.669 --> 00:04:35.629
 in connection with all-wheel drive gets from us the predicate swallow bad 

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:40.280
 the test consumption after twelve months is a proud twelve point 3 liters 

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:43.280
 Super Plus of course 

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:48.120
 the last business trip in the motorvision-shop Ortes zum Prüfstand 

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:49.219
 of the ADAC 

00:04:49.219 --> 00:04:53.379
 Any signs of wear and tear are mercilessly uncovered here first 

00:04:53.379 --> 00:04:56.379
 Program point the performance measurement 

00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:15.409
 154 hp, the Octavia had two command last as a year ago 

00:05:18.610 --> 00:05:23.129
 Performances provide 4 constant we have now measured or gives only 14 kilowatts 

00:05:23.129 --> 00:05:26.389
 under ten kilowatts 4 worrying normal electricity 

00:05:26.389 --> 00:05:27.919
 It's okay 

00:05:27.919 --> 00:05:31.020
 also shock absorbers and brakes are in top condition 

00:05:31.020 --> 00:05:34.020
 unfortunately there were problems with the gearbox 

00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:40.160
 at mileage 21 breaks 290 complete replacement of the clutch 

00:05:40.159 --> 00:05:44.860
 Cost 1000 € 690 including three days workshop visit 

00:05:46.279 --> 00:05:49.009
 the Czech workhorse still gets a good test result 

00:05:49.009 --> 00:05:52.589
 Decisive are the price and VW typical the solid workmanship 

00:05:53.379 --> 00:05:56.789
 as in many but on the thirsty it is in the engine to give up and in the 

00:05:56.789 --> 00:05:57.369
 Diesel 1
