00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:45.650 
sure about the top one but once we get

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:47.080 
sure about the top one but once we get
into<00:02:45.800> the<00:02:45.890> space<00:02:46.100> further<00:02:46.400> we<00:02:46.580> can<00:02:46.610> go<00:02:46.880> and

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:47.090 
into the space further we can go and

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:48.729 
into the space further we can go and
we'll<00:02:47.209> figure<00:02:47.390> that<00:02:47.540> out<00:02:47.600> so<00:02:47.930> all<00:02:48.530> these

00:02:48.729 --> 00:02:48.739 
we'll figure that out so all these

00:02:48.739 --> 00:02:49.870 
we'll figure that out so all these
goblins<00:02:49.160> and<00:02:49.250> the<00:02:49.340> troops<00:02:49.550> are<00:02:49.640> going<00:02:49.820> around

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:49.880 
goblins and the troops are going around

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:51.490 
goblins and the troops are going around
something<00:02:50.420> I<00:02:50.510> run<00:02:50.660> around<00:02:50.780> the<00:02:50.959> sides<00:02:51.170> to<00:02:51.380> get

00:02:51.490 --> 00:02:51.500 
something I run around the sides to get

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:53.530 
something I run around the sides to get
the<00:02:52.160> fifty<00:02:52.489> percent<00:02:52.850> and<00:02:53.150> the<00:02:53.180> others<00:02:53.480> are

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:53.540 
the fifty percent and the others are

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:55.150 
the fifty percent and the others are
going<00:02:53.750> for<00:02:53.930> the<00:02:54.050> storages<00:02:54.470> that<00:02:54.680> is<00:02:54.769> not<00:02:54.920> bad

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:55.160 
going for the storages that is not bad

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:57.670 
going for the storages that is not bad
we'll<00:02:55.459> go<00:02:55.610> we<00:02:56.330> got<00:02:56.510> a<00:02:56.900> little<00:02:57.110> bit<00:02:57.260> of<00:02:57.290> so<00:02:57.470> far

00:02:57.670 --> 00:02:57.680 
we'll go we got a little bit of so far

00:02:57.680 --> 00:02:58.870 
we'll go we got a little bit of so far
we'll<00:02:57.860> go<00:02:57.950> and<00:02:58.069> try<00:02:58.190> to<00:02:58.250> get<00:02:58.340> this<00:02:58.430> second

00:02:58.870 --> 00:02:58.880 
we'll go and try to get this second

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:00.630 
we'll go and try to get this second
storage<00:02:59.120> that'll<00:02:59.420> be<00:02:59.480> great<00:02:59.630> once<00:02:59.959> we<00:03:00.019> do<00:03:00.290> and

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:00.640 
storage that'll be great once we do and

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:04.900 
storage that'll be great once we do and
that'll<00:03:01.640> be<00:03:01.790> awesome<00:03:01.940> see<00:03:02.390> there<00:03:02.660> is<00:03:03.760> no<00:03:04.760> more

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:04.910 
that'll be awesome see there is no more

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:06.370 
that'll be awesome see there is no more
goblins<00:03:05.120> left<00:03:05.480> over<00:03:05.720> there<00:03:05.870> that<00:03:05.989> y'all<00:03:06.230> got

goblins left over there that y'all got

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:08.140 
goblins left over there that y'all got
pounded<00:03:06.860> and<00:03:07.130> these<00:03:07.340> Archer<00:03:07.640> should<00:03:07.850> take<00:03:08.000> out

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:08.150 
pounded and these Archer should take out

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:09.880 
pounded and these Archer should take out
that<00:03:08.840> one<00:03:09.110> you<00:03:09.230> can<00:03:09.350> see<00:03:09.380> they're<00:03:09.650> going<00:03:09.800> to

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:09.890 
that one you can see they're going to

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:12.640 
that one you can see they're going to
move<00:03:10.040> in<00:03:10.220> and<00:03:10.640> probably<00:03:11.030> gets<00:03:11.440> taken<00:03:12.440> out

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:12.650 
move in and probably gets taken out

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:15.070 
move in and probably gets taken out
before<00:03:12.769> and<00:03:13.069> get<00:03:13.160> to<00:03:13.340> the<00:03:13.459> next<00:03:13.780> storage<00:03:14.780> so<00:03:15.019> so

00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:15.080 
before and get to the next storage so so

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:17.130 
before and get to the next storage so so
be<00:03:15.350> about<00:03:15.560> it<00:03:15.709> guys<00:03:15.800> for<00:03:16.040> this<00:03:16.160> raid<00:03:16.370> and

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:17.140 
be about it guys for this raid and

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:19.750 
be about it guys for this raid and
that's<00:03:18.140> about<00:03:18.290> it<00:03:18.410> so<00:03:18.680> you<00:03:18.739> can<00:03:18.860> see<00:03:19.010> the<00:03:19.519> army

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:19.760 
that's about it so you can see the army

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:21.910 
that's about it so you can see the army
composition<00:03:19.970> i'm<00:03:20.269> using<00:03:20.540> is<00:03:20.690> 45<00:03:21.470> hours<00:03:21.680> route

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:21.920 
composition i'm using is 45 hours route

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:25.680 
composition i'm using is 45 hours route
45<00:03:22.250> barbs<00:03:22.730> and<00:03:22.910> then<00:03:23.420> we<00:03:23.510> have<00:03:23.630> 20<00:03:24.079> goblins<00:03:25.070> and

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:25.690 
45 barbs and then we have 20 goblins and

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:28.330 
45 barbs and then we have 20 goblins and
it's<00:03:26.690> either<00:03:26.840> 20<00:03:27.260> or<00:03:27.290> 10<00:03:27.470> I'm<00:03:27.620> pretty<00:03:28.130> I<00:03:28.160> think

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:28.340 
it's either 20 or 10 I'm pretty I think

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:30.600 
it's either 20 or 10 I'm pretty I think
it's<00:03:28.459> 20<00:03:28.670> so<00:03:28.880> it's<00:03:29.810> not<00:03:30.019> really<00:03:30.079> good<00:03:30.440> for

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:30.610 
it's 20 so it's not really good for

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:32.979 
it's 20 so it's not really good for
destroying<00:03:31.610> an<00:03:31.730> entire<00:03:31.850> basis<00:03:32.450> mainly<00:03:32.810> for

00:03:32.979 --> 00:03:32.989 
destroying an entire basis mainly for

00:03:32.989 --> 00:03:35.380 
destroying an entire basis mainly for
going<00:03:33.260> and<00:03:33.470> getting<00:03:33.650> collectors<00:03:34.100> and<00:03:34.579> some

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:35.390 
going and getting collectors and some

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:36.780 
going and getting collectors and some
small<00:03:35.660> storages<00:03:36.110> you<00:03:36.200> can<00:03:36.320> see<00:03:36.410> we<00:03:36.500> got

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:36.790 
small storages you can see we got

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:40.240 
small storages you can see we got
170,000<00:03:37.790> from<00:03:37.940> that<00:03:38.120> that<00:03:38.720> is<00:03:38.840> great<00:03:39.110> and<00:03:39.620> for

00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:40.250 
170,000 from that that is great and for

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:42.069 
170,000 from that that is great and for
that<00:03:40.340> army<00:03:40.670> that<00:03:40.880> week<00:03:41.030> of<00:03:41.180> an<00:03:41.269> army<00:03:41.510> that<00:03:41.930> was
