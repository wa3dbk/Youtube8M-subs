00:00:13.020 --> 00:00:16.020
 all right 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:24.160
 the day 

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:24.160
 all right 

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:37.470
 my life project was not to be a cook 

00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:37.470
 in fact, I'm going to 

00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:43.430
 already initially for him 

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:46.400
 earn a living 

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:48.440
 close to my mother after a summer on 

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:51.250
 everything they had in mind I wanted to be me 

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:53.470
 I wanted to be said that I did not want at all 

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:57.170
 it was not something that was in my plans 

00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:59.600
 this being a cook there was no 

00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:03.320
 family history 

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:06.020
 associated with the kitchen the closest thing was 

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:08.900
 good that my grandmother cooked well but 

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:11.330
 in domestic regime sometimes scrubbing 

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:13.280
 casseroles and little by little 

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:15.530
 we advance in the kitchen in different 

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:18.290
 departments to build 

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:19.820
 the cook that I am more or less today and 

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:21.799
 I can take over the management of a 

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:23.510
 kitchen of a restaurant that is the same 

00:01:21.799 --> 00:01:26.030
 that I direct today I am a cook 

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:28.900
 Self - taught on a shelf in the dénia 

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:28.900
 Valencian Community 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:33.800
 where up to three years 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:40.310
 the most that was expected of us that 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:42.600
 kitchen we go well and for example 

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:44.100
 We picked up one of the most important landmarks 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:45.840
 important not only of our 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:48.509
 career but also of 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:50.580
 our territory that was to collect three 

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:53.369
 michelin stars something here in the 

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:55.170
 Basque country I will not say it is common but 

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:57.450
 is normalized because there are very good 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:59.970
 restaurants and he's been there for a long time 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:02.250
 that is something absolutely historical and 

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:03.990
 that surely ten years ago if I 

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:06.420
 we would have said in the community 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:08.970
 valenciana to the visionary more visionary 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:10.769
 everything I can see there would not be no 

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:12.300
 I would have bet anything for a project of 

00:02:10.769 --> 00:02:15.360
 this guy we see we realize that the 

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:18.239
 landscape concept on a plate not 

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:20.550
 from the point of view of the landscape of 

00:02:18.239 --> 00:02:24.600
 product but of the landscape as more 

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:27.239
 physical and taken to the plate has served 

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:28.730
 for many cooks is to serve you as 

00:02:27.239 --> 00:02:32.660
 reference to build your own 

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:36.330
 forest garden garden if you close your eyes 

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:39.660
 and I would like to do it is a job of 

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:43.260
 the thought is of memory towards 

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:45.840
 towards a forest yours in which 

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:47.940
 have you lived some experience in the 

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:49.980
 that you can go for a walk in which you pass 

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:51.900
 your dog with whom he was traveling 

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:54.540
 or where he was traveling and because it's an area 

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:59.160
 I was traveling to some area of 

00:02:54.540 --> 00:03:02.880
 your most mountainous country we what 

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:06.569
 that we tried the idea was to create a 

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:08.020
 dish that reflects a moment 

00:03:06.569 --> 00:03:10.560
 Y 

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:10.560
 i 

00:03:14.710 --> 00:03:21.250
 architecture as a way of inspiration 

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:23.590
 in the kitchen we take an architect and a 

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:26.200
 of his more or less important works or 

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:27.910
 representative and serves as a way of 

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:30.940
 inspiration to build a dish the 

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:32.590
 which in okuma is an important architect 

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:35.170
 Japanese that represents minimalism 

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:37.740
 extreme and the house that appeared was the 

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:37.740
 water house 

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:42.810
 and it was water and crystal in essence its 

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:46.860
 structure 

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:49.709
 if we think of kitchen water and glass the 

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:52.290
 reference we have directly in the water 

00:03:49.709 --> 00:03:55.200
 of the fruits and in the candies the 

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:58.860
 crystal opera calatrava 

00:03:55.200 --> 00:04:00.900
 and the white part of the outside is the one that 

00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:02.730
 has fallen that is the trencadís is 

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:04.830
 architecturally it is what relates 

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:08.450
 much with the work of gaudi who is stoneware 

00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:11.010
 broken that allows to shape curved shapes 

00:04:08.450 --> 00:04:13.920
 we made a dish from in water with 

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:16.200
 car and whiskey giving it a volume 

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:18.750
 of an aesthetic fragility where 

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:20.340
 we tried to pass the light of the 

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:23.810
 same way that reference a bit the 

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:23.810
 architecture of santiago calatrava 

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:30.590
 ok let's go to a dish called the 

00:04:27.980 --> 00:04:32.409
 haze or you've just heard 

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:35.679
 sometime of him 

00:04:32.409 --> 00:04:40.050
 our idea on this plate basically 

00:04:35.679 --> 00:04:43.409
 was born of wanting to bring moisture 

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:45.300
 to a plate just talking about us 

00:04:43.409 --> 00:04:47.400
 we wanted to focus on the sensation and the 

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:49.050
 taste the feeling of fog is obvious 

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:51.419
 but above all in the products that we 

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:55.259
 they gave sensations of moisture in the mouth in 

00:04:51.419 --> 00:04:58.289
 nose and mouth so if you catch if 

00:04:55.259 --> 00:05:00.330
 you think a short raw mushroom is 

00:04:58.289 --> 00:05:02.879
 a sheet at the end the mushroom the 

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:05.729
 Exercise mentally put it in your mouth 

00:05:02.879 --> 00:05:07.800
 the feeling that remains is of humidity 

00:05:05.729 --> 00:05:09.659
 ok and what we do is throw water 

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:12.120
 just hot water inside that 

00:05:09.659 --> 00:05:13.919
 box where we have put different pines 

00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:16.370
 aromatic herbs in addition to oil 

00:05:13.919 --> 00:05:19.460
 essential and this effervescence is generated 

00:05:16.370 --> 00:05:22.720
 of fog mist 

00:05:19.460 --> 00:05:22.720
 is what somehow 

00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:26.980
 We intend to make the client 

00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:30.620
 come enhanced the aroma that is 

00:05:26.980 --> 00:05:33.200
 extracting the essential oil and the 

00:05:30.620 --> 00:05:35.840
 herbs there is a thing that as I cooked what 

00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:39.720
 you are going to have to develop is very 

00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:42.840
 important and it is the mental palate 

00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:44.880
 you are going to have to internalize and have 

00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:46.680
 this is super important for a 

00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:49.650
 cook for a sum aller for 

00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:52.560
 anyone who needs the 

00:05:49.650 --> 00:05:54.330
 olfactory and gustatory references for 

00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:57.720
 compose produce in some way 

00:05:54.330 --> 00:05:59.700
 dishes mentally when I tell you after 

00:05:57.720 --> 00:06:02.090
 the eyes and think about the taste of 

00:05:59.700 --> 00:06:04.500
 moisture of a mushroom I do it thinking 

00:06:02.090 --> 00:06:06.450
 that you have eaten mushrooms of this 

00:06:04.500 --> 00:06:08.820
 way if you have never done it 

00:06:06.450 --> 00:06:10.740
 loses the record is to build 

00:06:08.820 --> 00:06:13.680
 mentally the possibilities that it has 

00:06:10.740 --> 00:06:15.450
 a dish from the flavors that 

00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:17.910
 you have in your registry 

00:06:15.450 --> 00:06:19.590
 They will tell you before you start doing it 

00:06:17.910 --> 00:06:21.220
 the plate will work or not because 

00:06:19.590 --> 00:06:24.700
 we put on 

00:06:21.220 --> 00:06:26.590
 we do sometimes we create starting from 

00:06:24.700 --> 00:06:29.110
 things that we are going to do and we 

00:06:26.590 --> 00:06:32.050
 we prohibit things the prohibition of 

00:06:29.110 --> 00:06:34.390
 certain techniques of certain products of 

00:06:32.050 --> 00:06:36.460
 certain elaborations open us also 

00:06:34.390 --> 00:06:38.560
 roads in need imagine that 

00:06:36.460 --> 00:06:40.300
 we go by car and suddenly they disappear 

00:06:38.560 --> 00:06:42.610
 the cars, we have to invent 

00:06:40.300 --> 00:06:43.690
 another vehicle to go by land that does not 

00:06:42.610 --> 00:06:45.310
 be with wheels, well, we do not 

00:06:43.690 --> 00:06:47.500
 basically this we work with 

00:06:45.310 --> 00:06:48.970
 nitrogen we took off the nitrogen there was 

00:06:47.500 --> 00:06:51.070
 a year that we directly remove the 

00:06:48.970 --> 00:06:55.120
 restaurant freezer 

00:06:51.070 --> 00:06:57.940
 as a radical approach we take the 

00:06:55.120 --> 00:07:00.460
 will block the freezer cabinet and re 

00:06:57.940 --> 00:07:02.870
 we turn into a cabinet to conserve 

00:07:00.460 --> 00:07:04.250
 vegetable 

00:07:02.870 --> 00:07:06.920
 that there is not a freezer in a 

00:07:04.250 --> 00:07:08.360
 restaurant says many things not 

00:07:06.920 --> 00:07:09.830
 only that it freezes or does not freeze 

00:07:08.360 --> 00:07:12.920
 product but simply 

00:07:09.830 --> 00:07:15.720
 elaborations like an ice cream or a cube 

00:07:12.920 --> 00:07:17.640
 of ice there is not 

00:07:15.720 --> 00:07:19.470
 in principle say that these 

00:07:17.640 --> 00:07:21.480
 prohibitions to us from a point of 

00:07:19.470 --> 00:07:25.110
 Creative view also somehow 

00:07:21.480 --> 00:07:26.770
 they help us to advance or even 

00:07:25.110 --> 00:07:28.660
 back 

00:07:26.770 --> 00:07:31.840
 a more or less fast route so 

00:07:28.660 --> 00:07:34.470
 what we have done 

00:07:31.840 --> 00:07:36.060
 and we do in the rest of today 

00:07:34.470 --> 00:07:38.330
 but good at the end of the day it lets us be 

00:07:36.060 --> 00:07:38.330
 a project 

00:07:38.660 --> 00:07:44.060
 young still and we still have a lot 

00:07:41.240 --> 00:07:45.860
 a lot of war to give when you want 

00:07:44.060 --> 00:07:47.990
 when you finish when you are 

00:07:45.860 --> 00:07:50.110
 While you can there you have yours 

00:07:47.990 --> 00:07:50.110
 home
