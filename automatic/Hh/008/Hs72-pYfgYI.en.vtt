00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:50.960 
see it but what we have been able to do
is<00:01:48.810> shoot<00:01:49.050> underneath<00:01:49.590> there<00:01:49.920> and<00:01:50.160> see

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:50.970 
is shoot underneath there and see

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:53.450 
is shoot underneath there and see
everything<00:01:51.960> with<00:01:52.110> our<00:01:52.229> garment<00:01:52.710> side<00:01:52.920> view<00:01:53.220> I

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:53.460 
everything with our garment side view I

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:55.460 
everything with our garment side view I
mean<00:01:53.729> you<00:01:53.850> can<00:01:54.060> see<00:01:54.210> where<00:01:54.420> every<00:01:54.870> post<00:01:55.170> is

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:55.470 
mean you can see where every post is

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:57.290 
mean you can see where every post is
underneath<00:01:55.979> each<00:01:56.280> one<00:01:56.310> of<00:01:56.640> these<00:01:56.729> docks<00:01:57.030> you

00:01:57.290 --> 00:01:57.300 
underneath each one of these docks you

00:01:57.300 --> 00:01:58.880 
underneath each one of these docks you
can<00:01:57.479> see<00:01:57.600> the<00:01:57.720> shadows<00:01:58.229> that<00:01:58.260> are<00:01:58.470> going<00:01:58.710> back

00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:58.890 
can see the shadows that are going back

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:01.100 
can see the shadows that are going back
underneath<00:01:59.220> them<00:01:59.520> now<00:01:59.729> this<00:02:00.330> potentially

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:01.110 
underneath them now this potentially

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:02.930 
underneath them now this potentially
could<00:02:01.290> even<00:02:01.500> be<00:02:01.710> a<00:02:01.740> fish<00:02:02.160> that's<00:02:02.520> sitting<00:02:02.850> off

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:02.940 
could even be a fish that's sitting off

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:05.390 
could even be a fish that's sitting off
to<00:02:02.970> the<00:02:03.150> side<00:02:03.479> of<00:02:03.510> it<00:02:03.900> right<00:02:04.140> there<00:02:04.380> cuz<00:02:05.190> it's

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:05.400 
to the side of it right there cuz it's

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:08.870 
to the side of it right there cuz it's
up<00:02:05.670> a<00:02:05.820> little<00:02:06.000> bit<00:02:06.210> off<00:02:06.420> the<00:02:06.660> bottom<00:02:07.670> it<00:02:08.670> just

00:02:08.870 --> 00:02:08.880 
up a little bit off the bottom it just

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:10.550 
up a little bit off the bottom it just
shows<00:02:09.149> you<00:02:09.179> when<00:02:09.630> you<00:02:09.750> start<00:02:10.020> looking<00:02:10.170> at<00:02:10.410> the

know having side view that's how you

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:35.479 
know having side view that's how you
find<00:02:33.930> that<00:02:34.110> stuff<00:02:34.350> and<00:02:34.620> Garmin's<00:02:35.040> is<00:02:35.160> the<00:02:35.310> best

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:37.920 
by far it saves you the time of pulling

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:40.400 
by far it saves you the time of pulling
out<00:02:38.070> there<00:02:38.250> and<00:02:38.340> fish<00:02:38.489> you<00:02:39.060> know<00:02:39.239> now<00:02:40.019> I<00:02:40.290> don't

out there and fish you know now I don't

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:42.259

I can see that spot from 200 feet away I

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:47.840 
I can see that spot from 200 feet away I
don't<00:02:46.739> have<00:02:46.830> to<00:02:46.950> drive<00:02:47.160> over<00:02:47.370> the<00:02:47.459> top<00:02:47.640> of<00:02:47.670> them

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:47.850 
don't have to drive over the top of them

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:49.850 
don't have to drive over the top of them
fish<00:02:48.090> and<00:02:48.390> I<00:02:48.660> can<00:02:48.840> actually<00:02:49.049> see<00:02:49.380> a<00:02:49.410> fish<00:02:49.680> are

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:49.860 
fish and I can actually see a fish are

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:51.440 
fish and I can actually see a fish are
there<00:02:49.980> if<00:02:50.340> there's<00:02:50.610> a<00:02:50.670> school<00:02:50.940> of<00:02:51.000> fish<00:02:51.209> there

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:51.450 
there if there's a school of fish there

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:54.080 
there if there's a school of fish there
I<00:02:51.600> see<00:02:52.140> them<00:02:52.290> on<00:02:52.410> my<00:02:52.440> electronics<00:02:53.220> so<00:02:53.730> it

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:54.090 
I see them on my electronics so it

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:56.110 
I see them on my electronics so it
enables<00:02:54.540> me<00:02:54.660> to<00:02:54.690> cover<00:02:54.959> more<00:02:55.170> water<00:02:55.440> quicker

00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:56.120 
enables me to cover more water quicker

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:58.190 
enables me to cover more water quicker
pretty<00:02:57.120> cool<00:02:57.299> to<00:02:57.420> sit<00:02:57.570> here<00:02:57.690> and<00:02:57.780> look<00:02:57.870> at<00:02:58.049> your

00:02:58.190 --> 00:02:58.200 
pretty cool to sit here and look at your

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:00.259 
pretty cool to sit here and look at your
side<00:02:58.440> image<00:02:58.830> and<00:02:59.040> you<00:02:59.160> can<00:02:59.190> actually<00:02:59.820> see<00:03:00.090> it

00:03:00.259 --> 00:03:00.269 
side image and you can actually see it

00:03:00.269 --> 00:03:02.690 
side image and you can actually see it
shoot<00:03:00.600> back<00:03:01.350> up<00:03:01.590> underneath<00:03:01.980> to<00:03:02.280> each<00:03:02.400> one<00:03:02.610> of

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:02.700 
shoot back up underneath to each one of

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:05.270 
shoot back up underneath to each one of
these<00:03:02.790> slips<00:03:03.150> as<00:03:03.420> we're<00:03:03.660> going<00:03:04.080> by<00:03:04.290> so<00:03:04.739> you

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:05.280 
these slips as we're going by so you

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:07.130 
these slips as we're going by so you
know<00:03:05.340> this<00:03:05.549> is<00:03:05.730> bulkhead<00:03:06.209> this<00:03:06.480> is<00:03:06.630> bulkhead

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:07.140 
know this is bulkhead this is bulkhead

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:09.800 
know this is bulkhead this is bulkhead
and<00:03:07.470> then<00:03:07.860> it<00:03:08.160> goes<00:03:08.340> up<00:03:08.580> inside<00:03:09.209> those<00:03:09.480> slips

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:09.810 
and then it goes up inside those slips

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:11.090 
and then it goes up inside those slips
and<00:03:10.080> different<00:03:10.380> things<00:03:10.590> and<00:03:10.830> you<00:03:10.920> can

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:11.100 
and different things and you can

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:12.979 
and different things and you can
literally<00:03:11.850> leave<00:03:12.060> that<00:03:12.269> right<00:03:12.450> there<00:03:12.480> how

00:03:12.979 --> 00:03:12.989 
literally leave that right there how

00:03:12.989 --> 00:03:14.660 
literally leave that right there how
cool<00:03:13.260> is<00:03:13.380> that<00:03:13.410> you<00:03:13.709> know<00:03:13.830> bulkhead<00:03:14.220> bulkhead

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:14.670 
cool is that you know bulkhead bulkhead

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:17.030 
cool is that you know bulkhead bulkhead
underneath<00:03:15.299> the<00:03:15.450> slip<00:03:15.720> as<00:03:15.930> you're<00:03:16.530> going<00:03:16.739> by

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:17.040 
underneath the slip as you're going by

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:19.430

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:19.440 
and if you're in deeper water we would

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:21.050 
and if you're in deeper water we would
be<00:03:19.590> really<00:03:19.890> neat<00:03:20.100> we're<00:03:20.310> only<00:03:20.430> in<00:03:20.519> four<00:03:20.850> foot

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:21.060 
be really neat we're only in four foot

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:22.280 
be really neat we're only in four foot
of<00:03:21.150> water<00:03:21.269> right<00:03:21.510> here<00:03:21.540> if<00:03:21.750> you're<00:03:21.840> in<00:03:21.959> deeper

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:22.290 
of water right here if you're in deeper

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:24.590 
of water right here if you're in deeper
water<00:03:22.500> you<00:03:22.920> probably<00:03:23.310> be<00:03:23.459> able<00:03:23.670> to<00:03:23.760> see<00:03:23.970> you

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:24.600 
water you probably be able to see you

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:26.060 
water you probably be able to see you
know<00:03:24.630> things<00:03:24.900> that<00:03:25.080> brush<00:03:25.320> piles<00:03:25.650> other

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:26.070 
know things that brush piles other

00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:27.650 
know things that brush piles other
things<00:03:26.400> that<00:03:26.549> people<00:03:26.580> have<00:03:26.850> sunk<00:03:27.239> back<00:03:27.480> up

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:27.660 
things that people have sunk back up

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:29.660 
things that people have sunk back up
under<00:03:27.959> there<00:03:28.140> to<00:03:28.290> really<00:03:28.530> know<00:03:28.799> where<00:03:29.519> you

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:29.670 
under there to really know where you

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:31.759 
under there to really know where you
need<00:03:29.820> to<00:03:29.910> be<00:03:30.030> flipping<00:03:30.390> that<00:03:30.540> jig<00:03:30.810> or<00:03:31.110> casting

00:03:31.759 --> 00:03:31.769 
need to be flipping that jig or casting

00:03:31.769 --> 00:03:33.289 
need to be flipping that jig or casting
up<00:03:31.890> to<00:03:32.040> try<00:03:32.370> to<00:03:32.400> catch<00:03:32.640> one<00:03:32.670> but<00:03:33.030> that<00:03:33.120> is<00:03:33.180> a

00:03:33.289 --> 00:03:33.299 
up to try to catch one but that is a

00:03:33.299 --> 00:03:36.080 
up to try to catch one but that is a
great<00:03:33.660> example<00:03:34.019> of<00:03:34.320> how<00:03:34.380> side<00:03:34.829> imaging<00:03:35.370> really

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:36.090 
great example of how side imaging really

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:38.660 
great example of how side imaging really
works<00:03:36.329> to<00:03:36.690> go<00:03:37.200> down<00:03:37.380> the<00:03:37.530> bulkhead<00:03:37.950> shoot<00:03:38.489> up

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:38.670 
works to go down the bulkhead shoot up

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:40.100 
works to go down the bulkhead shoot up
in<00:03:38.820> those<00:03:38.940> gaps<00:03:39.209> and<00:03:39.540> see<00:03:39.660> what's<00:03:39.810> underneath

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:40.110 
in those gaps and see what's underneath

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:42.199 
in those gaps and see what's underneath
there<00:03:40.470> look<00:03:41.370> at<00:03:41.489> that<00:03:41.610> you<00:03:41.790> can<00:03:41.880> see<00:03:42.060> the

00:03:42.199 --> 00:03:42.209 
there look at that you can see the

00:03:42.209 --> 00:03:44.460 
there look at that you can see the
walkway<00:03:42.690> right<00:03:42.989> here<00:03:43.230> somebody's<00:03:43.890> walking

00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:44.470 
walkway right here somebody's walking

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:47.100 
walkway right here somebody's walking
between<00:03:44.830> where<00:03:44.980> they've<00:03:45.100> got<00:03:45.280> two<00:03:45.880> slips<00:03:46.300> what

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:47.110 
between where they've got two slips what

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:49.110 
between where they've got two slips what
definition<00:03:47.890> you<00:03:48.340> know<00:03:48.430> you<00:03:48.490> can<00:03:48.730> tell<00:03:48.910> there's

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:49.120 
definition you know you can tell there's

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:50.400 
definition you know you can tell there's
nothing<00:03:49.360> under<00:03:49.540> there<00:03:49.690> you<00:03:49.900> can<00:03:50.050> see<00:03:50.230> where

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:50.410 
nothing under there you can see where

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:52.680 
nothing under there you can see where
they've<00:03:50.590> kind<00:03:51.190> of<00:03:51.250> made<00:03:51.430> theirs<00:03:51.760> out<00:03:52.420> by

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:52.690 
they've kind of made theirs out by

00:03:52.690 --> 00:04:01.750 
they've kind of made theirs out by
itself

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:01.760 

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:04.660 

we'll<00:04:02.270> go<00:04:02.420> strictly<00:04:03.020> to<00:04:03.260> the<00:04:03.710> side<00:04:04.040> view

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:04.670 
we'll go strictly to the side view

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:06.790 
we'll go strictly to the side view
now<00:04:05.480> we'll<00:04:05.750> really<00:04:05.960> be<00:04:06.080> able<00:04:06.200> to<00:04:06.440> get<00:04:06.560> a<00:04:06.590> look

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:06.800 
now we'll really be able to get a look

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:10.270 
now we'll really be able to get a look
at<00:04:07.100> what<00:04:08.000> we're<00:04:08.180> looking<00:04:08.510> at<00:04:08.660> here<00:04:08.720> as<00:04:09.230> we<00:04:10.100> go

00:04:10.270 --> 00:04:10.280 
at what we're looking at here as we go

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:12.820 
at what we're looking at here as we go
by<00:04:10.460> all<00:04:10.700> these<00:04:10.910> boat<00:04:11.180> slips<00:04:11.540> here<00:04:11.870> this<00:04:12.620> is

by all these boat slips here this is

00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:15.070 
by all these boat slips here this is
just<00:04:13.070> the<00:04:13.190> canal<00:04:13.640> that<00:04:13.670> somebody<00:04:14.300> has<00:04:14.570> you

00:04:15.070 --> 00:04:15.080 
just the canal that somebody has you

know come in and build a housing to the
subdivision<00:04:17.030> in<00:04:17.480> and<00:04:18.019> you<00:04:18.200> can<00:04:18.440> see

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:18.850 
subdivision in and you can see

00:04:18.850 --> 00:04:21.400 
subdivision in and you can see
underneath<00:04:19.850> all<00:04:20.120> the<00:04:20.269> bulkhead<00:04:20.690> you<00:04:20.750> can<00:04:21.140> see

the detail of the bends as we're going

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:25.210 
the detail of the bends as we're going
along<00:04:23.900> this<00:04:24.050> is<00:04:24.200> a<00:04:24.230> nice<00:04:24.500> straight<00:04:24.800> one<00:04:25.040> the

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:25.220 
along this is a nice straight one the

00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:27.430 
along this is a nice straight one the
cut<00:04:25.460> goes<00:04:25.670> in<00:04:25.940> comes<00:04:26.180> out<00:04:26.510> that's<00:04:27.080> a<00:04:27.260> little

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:27.440 
cut goes in comes out that's a little

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:30.520 
cut goes in comes out that's a little
piece<00:04:27.680> of<00:04:27.710> where<00:04:28.580> a<00:04:28.610> jet<00:04:29.120> ski<00:04:29.390> was<00:04:29.540> sitting<00:04:29.930> now

piece of where a jet ski was sitting now

00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:33.400 
piece of where a jet ski was sitting now
we've<00:04:30.770> got<00:04:30.890> a<00:04:30.920> little<00:04:31.160> indentation<00:04:31.960> as<00:04:32.960> you<00:04:33.260> go

we've got a little indentation as you go
through<00:04:33.710> here<00:04:33.890> you're<00:04:34.160> literally<00:04:34.580> scanning

00:04:35.230 --> 00:04:35.240 
through here you're literally scanning

up underneath into everybody's docks as
you<00:04:37.850> go<00:04:37.970> here<00:04:38.150> now<00:04:38.360> if<00:04:38.450> we<00:04:38.570> were<00:04:38.690> in<00:04:38.720> a<00:04:38.840> little

00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:39.050

right now is you can look underneath

00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:46.390 
right now is you can look underneath
that's<00:04:44.540> a<00:04:44.630> walkway<00:04:44.870> right<00:04:45.290> there<00:04:45.560> you<00:04:46.250> could

00:04:46.390 --> 00:04:46.400 
that's a walkway right there you could

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:48.310 
that's a walkway right there you could
look<00:04:46.610> underneath<00:04:47.060> these<00:04:47.450> docks<00:04:47.750> and<00:04:47.960> even<00:04:48.200> see

look underneath these docks and even see

00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:50.080 
look underneath these docks and even see
brush<00:04:48.620> pilots<00:04:49.070> see<00:04:49.250> the<00:04:49.370> fish<00:04:49.580> sitting<00:04:49.970> up

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:50.090 
brush pilots see the fish sitting up

brush pilots see the fish sitting up
under<00:04:50.330> there<00:04:50.480> but<00:04:50.630> that's<00:04:50.720> probably<00:04:51.170> only<00:04:51.350> a

00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:51.470 
under there but that's probably only a

00:04:51.470 --> 00:04:53.260 
under there but that's probably only a
foot<00:04:51.740> deep<00:04:51.980> as<00:04:52.280> you<00:04:52.400> get<00:04:52.580> all<00:04:52.730> the<00:04:52.850> way<00:04:52.940> up<00:04:53.120> in

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:53.270 
foot deep as you get all the way up in

00:04:53.270 --> 00:04:55.090 
foot deep as you get all the way up in
there<00:04:53.420> but<00:04:53.480> you<00:04:53.780> can<00:04:53.960> literally<00:04:54.620> see<00:04:55.070> the

00:04:57.040 --> 00:04:57.050 
definition as we're going around it now

00:04:57.050 --> 00:04:59.440 
definition as we're going around it now
we<00:04:57.110> got<00:04:57.440> an<00:04:57.560> area<00:04:57.740> that's<00:04:57.920> undeveloped<00:04:58.760> right

00:04:59.440 --> 00:04:59.450 
we got an area that's undeveloped right

we got an area that's undeveloped right
here<00:04:59.690> where<00:04:59.930> there<00:05:00.050> wasn't<00:05:00.230> a<00:05:00.350> boat<00:05:00.530> slip<00:05:00.770> at

00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:01.070 
here where there wasn't a boat slip at

00:05:01.070 --> 00:05:02.220 
here where there wasn't a boat slip at
all

00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:02.230 
all

00:05:02.230 --> 00:05:05.080 
all
that's<00:05:03.230> all<00:05:03.440> grass<00:05:03.800> looks<00:05:04.430> like<00:05:04.550> maybe<00:05:04.760> a<00:05:04.880> rig

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:05.090 
that's all grass looks like maybe a rig

00:05:05.090 --> 00:05:06.970 
that's all grass looks like maybe a rig
of<00:05:05.240> a<00:05:05.300> tree<00:05:05.540> a<00:05:05.750> little<00:05:05.960> bitty<00:05:06.110> dock<00:05:06.380> somebody's

00:05:06.970 --> 00:05:06.980 
of a tree a little bitty dock somebody's

00:05:06.980 --> 00:05:09.610 
of a tree a little bitty dock somebody's
built<00:05:07.250> to<00:05:07.430> stand<00:05:07.669> on<00:05:08.000> on<00:05:08.810> the<00:05:08.930> other<00:05:09.080> side<00:05:09.410> of

00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:09.620 
built to stand on on the other side of

00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:11.380 
built to stand on on the other side of
this<00:05:09.740> as<00:05:10.100> you're<00:05:10.520> coming<00:05:10.790> along<00:05:10.880> here<00:05:11.210> it's

00:05:11.380 --> 00:05:11.390 
this as you're coming along here it's

00:05:11.390 --> 00:05:13.930 
this as you're coming along here it's
just<00:05:11.480> a<00:05:11.780> straight<00:05:12.230> bank<00:05:12.620> right<00:05:12.919> here<00:05:13.250> you<00:05:13.790> can

00:05:13.930 --> 00:05:13.940 
just a straight bank right here you can

00:05:13.940 --> 00:05:15.990 
just a straight bank right here you can
really<00:05:14.270> kind<00:05:14.450> of<00:05:14.570> look<00:05:14.750> at<00:05:14.900> how<00:05:15.020> its<00:05:15.260> defined

00:05:15.990 --> 00:05:16.000 
really kind of look at how its defined

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:18.280 
really kind of look at how its defined
to<00:05:17.000> where<00:05:17.180> there's<00:05:17.360> not<00:05:17.540> a<00:05:17.570> lot<00:05:17.780> there<00:05:17.810> after

00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:18.290 
to where there's not a lot there after

00:05:18.290 --> 00:05:20.800 
to where there's not a lot there after
you<00:05:18.350> go<00:05:18.470> past<00:05:18.710> that<00:05:18.860> last<00:05:19.100> boat<00:05:19.430> dock<00:05:19.750> that<00:05:20.750> is

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:20.810 
you go past that last boat dock that is

00:05:20.810 --> 00:05:23.110 
you go past that last boat dock that is
where<00:05:21.590> they've<00:05:21.770> actually<00:05:21.980> taken<00:05:22.250> sacks<00:05:22.760> of

00:05:23.110 --> 00:05:23.120 
where they've actually taken sacks of

00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:25.690 
where they've actually taken sacks of
quikrete<00:05:23.690> and<00:05:24.169> made<00:05:24.830> them<00:05:25.010> a<00:05:25.040> little<00:05:25.160> bulkhead

00:05:25.690 --> 00:05:25.700 
quikrete and made them a little bulkhead

00:05:25.700 --> 00:05:27.220 
quikrete and made them a little bulkhead
right<00:05:25.940> there<00:05:26.180> you<00:05:26.660> can<00:05:26.780> see<00:05:26.930> where<00:05:27.080> the

00:05:27.220 --> 00:05:27.230 
right there you can see where the

00:05:27.230 --> 00:05:29.170 
right there you can see where the
quikrete<00:05:27.620> actually<00:05:28.220> ended<00:05:28.669> and<00:05:28.880> now<00:05:28.970> we're

00:05:29.170 --> 00:05:29.180 
quikrete actually ended and now we're

00:05:29.180 --> 00:05:30.490 
quikrete actually ended and now we're
back<00:05:29.330> to<00:05:29.510> grass<00:05:29.780> on<00:05:30.110> there

00:05:30.490 --> 00:05:30.500 
back to grass on there

00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:32.110 
back to grass on there
now<00:05:30.980> you're<00:05:31.250> starting<00:05:31.550> to<00:05:31.610> see<00:05:31.730> straight

00:05:32.110 --> 00:05:32.120 
now you're starting to see straight

00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:33.880 
now you're starting to see straight
bulkhead<00:05:32.720> right<00:05:33.050> here<00:05:33.320> where<00:05:33.530> somebody's

00:05:33.880 --> 00:05:33.890 
bulkhead right here where somebody's

00:05:33.890 --> 00:05:35.320 
bulkhead right here where somebody's
come<00:05:34.040> in<00:05:34.190> and<00:05:34.310> built<00:05:34.460> it<00:05:34.610> you<00:05:34.730> can<00:05:34.880> even<00:05:35.150> see

00:05:51.880 --> 00:05:51.890 
looking at the technology that they've

00:05:51.890 --> 00:05:53.680 
looking at the technology that they've
built<00:05:52.130> into<00:05:52.400> these<00:05:52.550> boxes<00:05:52.760> and<00:05:53.240> you<00:05:53.450> start

00:05:55.270 --> 00:05:55.280 
looking about what you can see and how

00:05:55.280 --> 00:05:57.190 
looking about what you can see and how
easy<00:05:55.550> they<00:05:55.700> are<00:05:55.880> to<00:05:56.000> use<00:05:56.120> people<00:05:56.990> that<00:05:57.110> are

00:05:57.190 --> 00:05:57.200 
easy they are to use people that are

00:05:57.200 --> 00:05:59.469 
easy they are to use people that are
scared<00:05:57.500> to<00:05:57.650> make<00:05:58.520> that<00:05:58.760> next<00:05:58.970> step<00:05:59.120> from

00:05:59.469 --> 00:05:59.479 
scared to make that next step from

00:05:59.479 --> 00:06:01.510 
scared to make that next step from
electronics<00:06:00.229> basically<00:06:00.410> that<00:06:00.890> just<00:06:00.919> simple

00:06:01.510 --> 00:06:01.520 
electronics basically that just simple

00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:02.770 
electronics basically that just simple
depth<00:06:01.700> finder<00:06:02.000> that's<00:06:02.210> on<00:06:02.360> there<00:06:02.510> in<00:06:02.570> front<00:06:02.660> of

00:06:02.770 --> 00:06:02.780 
depth finder that's on there in front of

00:06:02.780 --> 00:06:04.690 
depth finder that's on there in front of
the<00:06:02.870> boat<00:06:03.020> now<00:06:03.500> can<00:06:03.770> rest<00:06:04.010> assured<00:06:04.400> when<00:06:04.610> they

00:06:04.690 --> 00:06:04.700 
the boat now can rest assured when they

00:06:04.700 --> 00:06:06.550 
the boat now can rest assured when they
put<00:06:04.880> a<00:06:04.910> unit<00:06:05.210> like<00:06:05.360> this<00:06:05.540> on<00:06:05.810> there<00:06:06.050> it's<00:06:06.290> so

00:06:06.550 --> 00:06:06.560 
put a unit like this on there it's so

00:06:06.560 --> 00:06:08.230 
put a unit like this on there it's so
intuitive<00:06:06.860> that<00:06:07.340> it<00:06:07.460> does<00:06:07.669> all<00:06:07.940> the<00:06:08.060> work<00:06:08.090> for

00:06:08.230 --> 00:06:08.240 
intuitive that it does all the work for

00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:10.900 
intuitive that it does all the work for
you<00:06:08.750> with<00:06:09.200> just<00:06:09.350> a<00:06:09.470> few<00:06:09.740> simple<00:06:10.010> button<00:06:10.490> pushes

you with just a few simple button pushes

00:06:10.910 --> 00:06:12.580 
you with just a few simple button pushes
and<00:06:11.090> it's<00:06:11.300> going<00:06:11.419> to<00:06:11.510> open<00:06:11.630> up<00:06:11.900> an<00:06:12.050> all-new
