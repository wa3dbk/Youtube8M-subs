00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:16.950 
and from the first shot I think I got

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:19.250 
and from the first shot I think I got
one<00:02:17.129> right<00:02:17.370> there<00:02:17.580> yeah<00:02:18.510> everyone<00:02:18.900> on<00:02:19.019> ten

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:19.260 
one right there yeah everyone on ten

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:22.699 
one right there yeah everyone on ten
chance<00:02:19.560> of<00:02:19.739> getting<00:02:20.040> a<00:02:20.420> ghost<00:02:21.420> horse<00:02:21.780> allows

00:02:22.699 --> 00:02:22.709 
chance of getting a ghost horse allows

00:02:22.709 --> 00:02:26.119 
chance of getting a ghost horse allows
the<00:02:22.860> first<00:02:23.099> horse<00:02:23.280> I<00:02:23.400> kill<00:02:23.610> I<00:02:23.640> got<00:02:23.970> one<00:02:25.129> so

00:02:26.119 --> 00:02:26.129 
the first horse I kill I got one so

00:02:26.129 --> 00:02:28.850 
the first horse I kill I got one so
there's<00:02:26.400> a<00:02:26.459> ghost<00:02:26.760> horse<00:02:27.030> finally<00:02:27.959> well<00:02:28.590> you

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:28.860 
there's a ghost horse finally well you

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:32.540 
there's a ghost horse finally well you
can<00:02:29.040> write<00:02:29.280> them<00:02:29.519> with<00:02:30.330> school<00:02:30.810> and<00:02:31.250> I<00:02:32.250> think

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:32.550 
can write them with school and I think

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:34.430 
can write them with school and I think
that<00:02:32.730> mobs<00:02:33.030> will<00:02:33.330> not<00:02:33.569> attack<00:02:33.900> you<00:02:34.140> if<00:02:34.260> you're

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:34.440 
that mobs will not attack you if you're

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:38.650 
that mobs will not attack you if you're
on<00:02:34.470> them<00:02:35.330> or<00:02:36.330> I<00:02:36.810> think<00:02:37.319> that<00:02:37.530> the<00:02:37.739> Pegasus

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:38.660 
on them or I think that the Pegasus

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:45.620 
on them or I think that the Pegasus
