00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:51.980 
because Ben Bernanke is printing dollars
like<00:01:49.500> an<00:01:49.649> upper<00:01:49.770> storm<00:01:50.250> and<00:01:50.579> that<00:01:51.299> is<00:01:51.570> lowering

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990 
like an upper storm and that is lowering

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:54.200 
like an upper storm and that is lowering
the<00:01:52.170> value<00:01:52.500> of<00:01:52.590> the<00:01:52.710> u.s.<00:01:52.920> dollar<00:01:53.070> and<00:01:53.700> that

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.210 
the value of the u.s. dollar and that

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:56.300 
the value of the u.s. dollar and that
means<00:01:54.600> that<00:01:54.750> oil<00:01:55.140> goes<00:01:55.500> up<00:01:55.799> that's<00:01:56.100> what

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310 
means that oil goes up that's what

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:58.429 
means that oil goes up that's what
happens<00:01:56.670> when<00:01:56.759> you<00:01:56.909> print<00:01:57.210> money<00:01:57.450> dollar<00:01:58.110> down

00:01:58.429 --> 00:01:58.439 
happens when you print money dollar down

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:01.010 
happens when you print money dollar down
oil<00:01:58.770> up<00:01:59.280> gas<00:01:59.909> up<00:02:00.119> I<00:02:00.420> think<00:02:00.659> that's<00:02:00.840> what's

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.020 
oil up gas up I think that's what's

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:01.999
