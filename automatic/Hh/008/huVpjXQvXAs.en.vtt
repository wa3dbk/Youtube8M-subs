00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:04.410
 today i want to touch on the topic 

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:07.109
 chicken egg production I will not compare 

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:10.969
 with someone or something i am just 

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:13.950
 I will tell you how many eggs we smoke and 

00:00:10.969 --> 00:00:14.849
 is this the norm the breed we have 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:18.660
 gray master 

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:20.850
 tanya a little bald especially top 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:24.090
 parts because all the same cellular 

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:27.349
 content and they are bald not because 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:30.240
 cages they sit on the cells do not rub 

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:33.000
 calmly can get dokorma eat 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:36.660
 but because here they have such a stove 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.500
 which is constantly scooby but we already 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:40.230
 think about it 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:43.440
 remove this rooster then what 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:47.670
 hatching egg can not hold here 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:51.690
 egg demolished have to pick it up now 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:56.160
 the fumes you che me you peck 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:58.379
 the egg gives the face rolled out like this 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:02.190
 we have three egg's sense 

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:04.799
 we have such a wicked stove and smoke does not regret 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:07.830
 and its owners who constantly pit 

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:12.650
 the feed is filled with a two-tier cage 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:15.350
 and it turns out 8 chickens and one rooster 

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:17.159
 upper tier and respectively lower 

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:20.430
 here we have a stove 

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:21.060
 another and he can calmly observe 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:24.810
 what 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:27.990
 chickens at their plumage 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:32.100
 almost everyone who then lost some 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:33.630
 part but generally they feel better 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:38.479
 because the stove 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:41.640
 here calm he rushes from me a 

00:01:38.479 --> 00:01:45.390
 there is a furious stove, he seeks out 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:48.960
 billionaire disappeared in 8th round 8 there is smoke 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:53.490
 here the feed is the same and they carry us 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:54.909
 average stable ten eggs each 

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:56.590
 day 

00:01:54.909 --> 00:02:01.390
 in such a simple way they 

00:01:56.590 --> 00:02:03.240
 roll eggs catchers boaer 

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:06.780
 probably 5 if 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:10.989
 There are such days when they demolish 

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:15.430
 8 eggs when 9 eggs 

00:02:10.989 --> 00:02:19.299
 when generally 12 or 13 Nov so read 

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:23.590
 average all the same, our such buzz and church 

00:02:19.299 --> 00:02:26.890
 mat stiu 16 chicken is a tiger dressed 10 

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:29.950
 17 that is abundant on the top ten can 

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:33.670
 assume they bear it with that 

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:36.010
 that we feed them with special feed 

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:39.010
 with all the additives and 

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:42.040
 which I also shoot a video 

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:47.109
 what yes what age chicken 

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:49.629
 what kind of bacon do we give out using 

00:02:47.109 --> 00:02:51.970
 this pocket we have a height of a dozen of us 

00:02:49.629 --> 00:02:55.379
 it suits and reading on the Internet 

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:59.260
 no drying at all carry an egg a day 

00:02:55.379 --> 00:03:02.349
 maybe it refers to rocks by type 

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:05.260
 broken brown and at least this is a master grain 

00:03:02.349 --> 00:03:08.940
 them egg production is similar but it is meat 

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:11.739
 egg breed meaning you see what 

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:16.260
 especially roosters even chickens can 

00:03:11.739 --> 00:03:20.370
 Of course equate to scooters almost and 

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:23.079
 by the way this kuryan already about as we 

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:27.069
 they kind of got them 

00:03:23.079 --> 00:03:29.650
 times they raced last fall 

00:03:27.069 --> 00:03:30.819
 that is, in the fall it will be a year for him as they 

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:34.209
 rushing 

00:03:30.819 --> 00:03:37.269
 but as we already know after a year 

00:03:34.209 --> 00:03:40.030
 egg production is falling 

00:03:37.269 --> 00:03:43.500
 there is no sense to keep and you need to rejuvenate 

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:45.730
 them on this with us all hens 

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:49.419
