from 16 blocks away and it requires a

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:40.729 
from 16 blocks away and it requires a
box<00:00:38.640> of<00:00:38.820> bullets<00:00:38.969> this<00:00:39.840> is<00:00:39.960> the<00:00:40.079> fastest<00:00:40.530> gun

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:40.739

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:43.670 
box of bullets this is the fastest gun
in<00:00:40.770> this<00:00:40.950> mod<00:00:41.219> and<00:00:42.079> finally<00:00:43.079> there<00:00:43.440> is<00:00:43.469> the

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:43.680 
in this mod and finally there is the

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:46.819 
in this mod and finally there is the
bolt-action<00:00:44.370> rifle<00:00:45.000> which<00:00:45.480> is<00:00:45.690> 20<00:00:46.050> damage<00:00:46.260> and

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
it can fire from 100 blocks away so this

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:50.119 
it can fire from 100 blocks away so this
thing's<00:00:48.899> pretty<00:00:49.050> much<00:00:49.260> like<00:00:49.379> a<00:00:49.410> sniper<00:00:49.649> rifle

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129 
thing's pretty much like a sniper rifle

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:52.360 
thing's pretty much like a sniper rifle
it's<00:00:50.879> the<00:00:50.940> most<00:00:51.090> powerful<00:00:51.480> gun<00:00:51.780> in<00:00:51.899> this<00:00:52.020> mod

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:52.370

it's the most powerful gun in this mod
alright<00:00:53.370> it's<00:00:53.520> starting<00:00:53.760> to<00:00:53.820> get<00:00:53.910> dark<00:00:53.969> so<00:00:54.539> i'm

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 
alright it's starting to get dark so i'm

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:57.369 
alright it's starting to get dark so i'm
going<00:00:54.750> to<00:00:54.840> show<00:00:55.079> you<00:00:55.430> what<00:00:56.430> they<00:00:56.579> can<00:00:56.760> each<00:00:56.910> do

00:00:57.369 --> 00:00:57.379 
going to show you what they can each do

00:00:57.379 --> 00:01:01.490 
going to show you what they can each do
and<00:00:58.379> you<00:00:58.859> can<00:00:59.010> see<00:00:59.129> the<00:00:59.160> flintlock<00:00:59.640> pistol<00:01:00.500> you

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
and you can see the flintlock pistol you

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:03.229 
and you can see the flintlock pistol you
can<00:01:01.710> be<00:01:01.770> pretty<00:01:01.949> close<00:01:02.190> to<00:01:02.609> shoot<00:01:02.879> and<00:01:03.120> it

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 
can be pretty close to shoot and it

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:04.670 
can be pretty close to shoot and it
doesn't<00:01:03.480> really<00:01:03.600> do<00:01:03.780> that<00:01:03.809> much<00:01:03.960> damage<00:01:04.049> and

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
doesn't really do that much damage and

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:07.039 
doesn't really do that much damage and
it<00:01:05.460> takes<00:01:05.580> a<00:01:05.729> long<00:01:05.909> time<00:01:05.970> to<00:01:06.180> reload<00:01:06.630> so<00:01:06.869> this

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049 
it takes a long time to reload so this

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:09.679 
it takes a long time to reload so this
is<00:01:07.170> a<00:01:07.200> really<00:01:07.650> effective<00:01:07.979> gun<00:01:08.510> there's<00:01:09.510> the

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:09.689 
is a really effective gun there's the

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:13.190 
is a really effective gun there's the
musket<00:01:10.220> it<00:01:11.220> does<00:01:11.700> a<00:01:11.729> lot<00:01:12.119> of<00:01:12.180> damage<00:01:12.510> but<00:01:13.140> I

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
musket it does a lot of damage but I

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:15.710 
musket it does a lot of damage but I
mean<00:01:13.500> it's<00:01:14.100> really<00:01:14.490> slow<00:01:15.090> like<00:01:15.330> this<00:01:15.540> one

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
mean it's really slow like this one

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:18.830 
mean it's really slow like this one
takes<00:01:15.930> like<00:01:16.080> 10<00:01:16.650> seconds<00:01:17.100> to<00:01:17.280> reload<00:01:17.659> this<00:01:18.659> is

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
takes like 10 seconds to reload this is

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:21.200 
takes like 10 seconds to reload this is
the<00:01:19.049> sniper<00:01:19.470> rifle<00:01:19.979> and<00:01:20.220> it'll<00:01:20.490> practically

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
the sniper rifle and it'll practically

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:22.910 
the sniper rifle and it'll practically
kill<00:01:21.479> anything<00:01:21.780> in<00:01:21.960> one<00:01:22.170> shy<00:01:22.439> you<00:01:22.500> know<00:01:22.650> does
