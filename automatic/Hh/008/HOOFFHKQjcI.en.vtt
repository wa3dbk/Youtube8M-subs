00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:04.880
 very good to all guys and girls like 

00:00:02.479 --> 00:00:07.719
 I bring you another chapter of the guide in 

00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:11.389
 the one that we stayed in town calls agile 

00:00:07.719 --> 00:00:13.429
 because we were coming for another one 

00:00:11.389 --> 00:00:15.530
 legendary yes sir in carry two 

00:00:13.429 --> 00:00:18.679
 followed good in four actually 

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:20.480
 but well manna I'm focusing on 

00:00:18.679 --> 00:00:23.240
 the legendary ones that remain and then 

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:25.189
 When finished with the legendary because 

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:29.779
 the little extras that the game has 

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:32.570
 I will do them doing and doing and 

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:36.140
 true if I have left something leaving in 

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:39.829
 comments because well I can go 

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:43.129
 and if I can go to 

00:00:39.829 --> 00:00:45.800
 to do it and well now we will go 

00:00:43.129 --> 00:00:50.110
 of course 

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:50.110
 this cave that is the cave 

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:57.750
 I do not know the reborn caves I think it's the 

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:00.180
 cave to be reborn I think 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:03.860
 and we have to go down here here 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:03.860
 We were previously with 

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:09.130
 I do not remember the name but we were 

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:09.130
 with an uncle 

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:16.600
 an aunt I do not remember well 

00:01:12.909 --> 00:01:20.640
 and good concrete concretely you like 

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:23.730
 go down here where the doctor is 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:27.450
 and going down going down 

00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:32.090
 here have if you want to activate this 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:34.909
 which is the most active stone 

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:36.720
 gets stuck in heaven if the zeus invoke 

00:01:34.909 --> 00:01:39.120
 effectively 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:42.030
 the time is not a joke but simply 

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:45.390
 the sky falls you know how water falls 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:46.860
 sky is in pokemons training pokemons 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:50.590
 Hallelujah 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:53.450
 good and we have it here in front of us 

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:57.439
 I was preparing another challenge 

00:01:53.450 --> 00:02:01.219
 and back in my opinion is a very pokémon 

00:01:57.439 --> 00:02:05.560
 good yes yes yes yes it's very good that attracts 

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:05.560
 it's a pretty strong Pokémon 

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:10.210
 let's capture him 

00:02:12.819 --> 00:02:16.870
 ballet and has music because we have 

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:20.519
 legendary 

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:20.519
 I think it's time 

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:26.300
 that of also this music that has 

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:27.800
 record and these seem to me the king and 

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:29.520
 leagues I think it's the one that has this 

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:33.560
 song 

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:36.160
 we will start with lightning 

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:38.790
 since he was saying terrible threats to 

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:41.170
 get back 

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:43.659
 effectively for this reason it is a 

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:45.360
 terrible threat because literally I 

00:02:43.659 --> 00:02:47.260
 kills a patter 

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:51.599
 ah no 

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:51.599
 well you burn me you know great 

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:57.860
 and it kills me with numbered 

00:02:55.160 --> 00:03:03.040
 and I 'm going to change pokemon powder 

00:02:57.860 --> 00:03:03.040
 I'll take you out to sound for rays 

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:12.830
 to take away little and how can you 

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:15.010
 observe good as you can observe 

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:19.000
 are you back 

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:20.980
 you do not have spin attacks it was numbered and 

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:24.209
 I do not know which one is more I guess I have to 

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:28.430
 head iron and I do not know any of those 

00:03:24.209 --> 00:03:34.069
 but we are trying to enable it like this 

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:36.290
 a critical hit frozen is worth serious 

00:03:34.069 --> 00:03:38.690
 have you seen that 

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:41.840
 you tease me 

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:43.670
 in serious pressure able to freeze low 

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:46.220
 in order it does not matter 

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:48.890
 let's go for the magnificent policy 

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:51.099
 mystical because they go to use all 

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:51.099
 games 

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:57.390
 there we have it 

00:03:55.050 --> 00:03:59.030
 and of course we're going to capture it 

00:03:57.390 --> 00:04:04.790
 Clear 

00:03:59.030 --> 00:04:07.030
 attentive look worth nonoalco side let's go to 

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:07.030
 use 

00:04:07.319 --> 00:04:10.280
 or maybe today 

00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:16.180
 1 2 3 and it therefore does not capture why you 

00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:20.880
 they do damage like they were pokemon 

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:20.880
 normal to the second because it is worth a pipe 

00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:31.900
 ok we have captured as if nothing 

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:31.900
 they carry 15 is that I have no words 

00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:38.320
 this guy we'll call him heat heat 

00:04:35.670 --> 00:04:40.210
 heat in pure state 

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:41.470
 but we 're not warm but 

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:43.690
 good heat 

00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:45.280
 since I do not have many letters because 

00:04:43.690 --> 00:04:46.900
 I call heat 

00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:49.600
 and good 

00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:52.880
 there we have backwards and we have 

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:55.430
 captured with two because you're worth 

00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:58.100
 it's pretty incredible the truth is that 

00:04:55.430 --> 00:04:59.960
 I'm having a luck 

00:04:58.100 --> 00:05:02.510
 capturing the legendary as if 

00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:05.030
 they were little normal waltz as if they were 

00:05:02.510 --> 00:05:08.260
 pokémons I know but if you look 

00:05:05.030 --> 00:05:11.930
 well if you are still following my guide 

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:15.180
 practically all pokémons no no 

00:05:11.930 --> 00:05:18.570
 they were resisting the first because you're going 

00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:21.090
 apart with the few excluding 

00:05:18.570 --> 00:05:23.310
 legendary I mean normal pokemon is 

00:05:21.090 --> 00:05:26.490
 always to the first because to which 

00:05:23.310 --> 00:05:29.520
 I was throwing in I do not know if it's luck or not 

00:05:26.490 --> 00:05:31.229
 I know what's wrong with this but let's go 

00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:33.780
 look at the statistics of our gea 

00:05:31.229 --> 00:05:36.780
 Finally, finally, to the tram 

00:05:33.780 --> 00:05:38.789
 it's a good kind steel fire type and I think 

00:05:36.780 --> 00:05:41.120
 You already know it but well I say it for 

00:05:38.789 --> 00:05:41.120
 if anything 

00:05:41.900 --> 00:05:45.310
 let's see what it has 

00:05:45.340 --> 00:05:49.590
 here 

00:05:47.430 --> 00:05:52.740
 data 

00:05:49.590 --> 00:05:56.250
 more coming out with kind then it has 

00:05:52.740 --> 00:05:58.410
 the special defense favorable defense 

00:05:56.250 --> 00:06:00.600
 unfavorable physics you could say that 

00:05:58.410 --> 00:06:03.480
 that has its advantages but good 

00:06:00.600 --> 00:06:06.120
 Moist attacks a hell you call 

00:06:03.480 --> 00:06:07.140
 the girl when reading the adjacent pokemon 

00:06:06.120 --> 00:06:09.690
 in combat 

00:06:07.140 --> 00:06:12.600
 this attack is for double combat and 

00:06:09.690 --> 00:06:15.800
 triples I guess spin fire a ring of 

00:06:12.600 --> 00:06:15.800
 fire that catches the target 

00:06:16.070 --> 00:06:21.009
 in iron head 

00:06:18.969 --> 00:06:23.379
 and every scare 

00:06:21.009 --> 00:06:25.749
 I of course if the web takes me 

00:06:23.379 --> 00:06:29.529
 only then I'm going to put a balloon 

00:06:25.749 --> 00:06:31.180
 helium and you change these attack attacks 

00:06:29.529 --> 00:06:33.460
 more powerful 

00:06:31.180 --> 00:06:35.050
 what they want is quite powerful as 

00:06:33.460 --> 00:06:38.139
 we take what has many weaknesses 

00:06:35.050 --> 00:06:40.560
 but good that has been everything for today 

00:06:38.139 --> 00:06:42.660
 I hope you liked it 

00:06:40.560 --> 00:06:44.600
 and in the next chapter and we're going to 

00:06:42.660 --> 00:06:46.670
 another legendary 

00:06:44.600 --> 00:06:48.150
 If you want to go, you know, you only have to 

00:06:46.670 --> 00:06:51.000
