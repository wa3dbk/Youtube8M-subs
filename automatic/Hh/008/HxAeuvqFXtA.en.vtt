00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:48.640 
that I've read about this it doesn't
seem<00:02:47.270> like<00:02:47.450> it<00:02:47.630> would<00:02:47.750> be<00:02:47.780> an<00:02:47.990> alien<00:02:48.290> movie<00:02:48.440> but

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:48.650 
seem like it would be an alien movie but

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:50.440 
seem like it would be an alien movie but
I<00:02:48.680> guess<00:02:48.890> it<00:02:49.040> is<00:02:49.190> I<00:02:49.370> guess<00:02:49.520> the<00:02:49.700> xenomorph<00:02:50.030> is

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:50.450 
I guess it is I guess the xenomorph is
