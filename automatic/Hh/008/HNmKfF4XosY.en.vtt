00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:04.650
 good i'm just dark for those of 

00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:06.860
 dotcom construction and as already presented 

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:09.600
 julio fernández at the beginning of the week 

00:00:06.860 --> 00:00:12.950
 this week we have to analyze the cube x 

00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:15.080
 6 the first 8 cores of the brand kubot 

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:19.610
 the mounting processor is already known 

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:23.720
 on average tmt 65 92 of 8 cores 1 with 7 

00:00:19.610 --> 00:00:28.099
 gigahertz accompanied to the gpu and 450 

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:30.410
 mp4 of 4 cores and 1 gb of ram the game 

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:33.230
 chosen the mother comba 4 a very game 

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:36.469
 demanding where you can see prefer where 

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:38.300
 able to see the hooker perfectly 

00:00:36.469 --> 00:00:40.340
 mobile can with the game to spare or in 

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:41.950
 this case the processor 

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:44.400
 we go 

00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:46.440
 take advantage here 

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:48.860
 the video introduction for you to see 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:48.860
 how is it heard 

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:53.590
 it sounds very good 

00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:57.910
 the truth that calls the cube screen 

00:00:56.500 --> 00:01:00.010
 it looks really good 

00:00:57.910 --> 00:01:02.160
 télam before the sound is a good 

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:02.160
 experience 

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:12.110
 we go down here is already going to start 

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:18.130
 forgive me if I'm a bit slow today but 

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:20.229
 is that we have not done the 

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:22.270
 try with this video game and yes that is 

00:01:20.229 --> 00:01:25.649
 true that 

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:25.649
 that I do not remember very well 

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:30.280
 well first let's do a test 

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:32.060
 let's put here first some tests 

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:34.909
 zoom 

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:38.000
 As you can see we zoom, you know there's no 

00:01:34.909 --> 00:01:40.340
 no latency latency if 

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:42.590
 it looks without jerking very well relate I 

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:45.619
 same as when we take when we move 

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:49.429
 around upstairs down all very very very 

00:01:45.619 --> 00:01:51.890
 fluid well let's stick to shiver by 

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:53.900
 It is not here 

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:59.080
 one less 

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:59.080
 if I can see here another less 

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:05.770
 we're going to leave that because we're going to go 

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:05.770
 let's run a little bit here 

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:11.830
 the performance is very good because what 

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:14.530
 you are seeing it and this great 

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:16.060
 performance with the quality that is that I 

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:19.090
 I do not get it right but the screen has very 

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:20.890
 good quality gives a feeling that I do not 

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:23.800
 have given other phones at the time of 

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:26.290
 play of throwing us on phones with 

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:28.120
 5 5 inch screens but I think 

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:32.180
 that now more the effect of the screen 

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:35.000
 great than the quality itself 

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:38.150
 because now it is also seen 

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:40.510
 that the good car we are going to go up there 

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:40.510
 above 

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:46.830
 we continue here we go two minutes 240 

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:50.820
 so they do not have much 

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:53.240
 here every day you hear how you hear 

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:53.240
 shots 

00:02:58.460 --> 00:03:02.320
 he does not listen very well the truth 

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:05.420
 and what does this give us? 

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:13.870
 there's a bit of suicide for you to see 

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:22.560
 on the red screen as cais stretches to 

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:24.810
 volume that I think the test is 

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:27.240
 good enough because I had not seen 

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:27.720
 x cube ourselves there works 

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:30.840
 very well 

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:32.400
 many people say that that minimum for a 

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:35.040
 eight-core process has to be 

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:39.209
 gb of ram and in this case with one what 

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:40.800
 moves perfectly that kind of continuum 

00:03:39.209 --> 00:03:42.300
 we go associated with how this one has 

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:44.850
 used the operating system if it is 

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:46.080
 well optimized 1 and 2 evidently to 2 

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:48.360
 is going to notice but with one is also 

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:50.070
 enough in this case cube with this 

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:52.040
 model and the operating system that it carries 

00:03:50.070 --> 00:03:55.129
 OK 

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:57.109
 this operative that leads are quite 

00:03:55.129 --> 00:04:00.140
 uses and goes very well, as he said 

00:03:57.109 --> 00:04:01.640
 a phone that is worth more to play and 

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:05.019
 I hope you like analysis and even the 

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:05.019
 next week until later
