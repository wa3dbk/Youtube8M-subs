I've talked to him in private and he was

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:56.359 
I've talked to him in private and he was
non-committal<00:01:54.869> but<00:01:55.860> he<00:01:55.979> thought<00:01:56.159> it<00:01:56.280> was

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:56.369 
non-committal but he thought it was

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:58.149 
non-committal but he thought it was
interesting<00:01:56.729> that<00:01:57.149> this<00:01:57.299> is

00:01:58.149 --> 00:01:58.159 
interesting that this is

00:01:58.159 --> 00:02:00.399 
interesting that this is
planet<00:01:58.640> which<00:01:58.850> is<00:01:59.060> legitimately<00:01:59.270> there<00:02:00.200> is

00:02:00.399 --> 00:02:00.409 
planet which is legitimately there is

00:02:00.409 --> 00:02:02.440 
planet which is legitimately there is
coming<00:02:00.740> from<00:02:00.979> what<00:02:01.189> I<00:02:01.219> guess<00:02:01.549> from<00:02:02.299> the

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:02.450 
coming from what I guess from the

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:04.989 
coming from what I guess from the
southern<00:02:02.869> hemisphere<00:02:02.950> coming<00:02:03.950> from<00:02:04.159> the<00:02:04.729> deep

00:02:04.989 --> 00:02:04.999 
southern hemisphere coming from the deep

00:02:04.999 --> 00:02:08.589 
southern hemisphere coming from the deep
south<00:02:05.450> and<00:02:05.840> like<00:02:06.469> over<00:02:06.979> Antarctica<00:02:07.599> coming

00:02:08.589 --> 00:02:08.599 
south and like over Antarctica coming

00:02:08.599 --> 00:02:11.229 
south and like over Antarctica coming
this<00:02:08.840> way<00:02:09.140> says<00:02:09.739> not<00:02:10.009> coming<00:02:10.340> from<00:02:10.580> somewhere

00:02:11.229 --> 00:02:11.239 
this way says not coming from somewhere

00:02:11.239 --> 00:02:13.330 
this way says not coming from somewhere
we<00:02:11.569> can<00:02:11.780> see<00:02:11.989> it<00:02:12.049> but<00:02:12.319> if<00:02:12.410> you're<00:02:12.530> down<00:02:12.709> in<00:02:12.739> Peru

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:13.340 
we can see it but if you're down in Peru

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:15.130 
we can see it but if you're down in Peru
or<00:02:13.849> in<00:02:14.030> the<00:02:14.150> mountains<00:02:14.540> you<00:02:14.599> can<00:02:14.840> see<00:02:15.019> it

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:15.140 
or in the mountains you can see it

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:16.509 
or in the mountains you can see it
coming<00:02:15.560> from<00:02:15.739> the<00:02:15.950> south

00:02:16.509 --> 00:02:16.519 
coming from the south

00:02:16.519 --> 00:02:19.900 
coming from the south
they've<00:02:16.970> already<00:02:17.180> taken<00:02:17.660> pictures<00:02:18.319> of<00:02:18.500> it<00:02:18.910> so

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:19.910 
they've already taken pictures of it so

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:22.089 
they've already taken pictures of it so
they<00:02:20.090> know<00:02:20.120> it's<00:02:20.450> legitimate<00:02:21.230> yes<00:02:21.590> it<00:02:21.860> is

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:25.190 
coming this way seems to be about twice

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:27.309 
coming this way seems to be about twice
the<00:02:25.250> size<00:02:25.700> of<00:02:25.970> the<00:02:26.120> earth<00:02:26.239> there<00:02:26.870> they<00:02:26.989> refer

speculation<00:03:46.030> of<00:03:46.180> our<00:03:46.300> solar<00:03:46.629> system<00:03:46.750> was

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:47.290 
speculation of our solar system was

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:49.650 
speculation of our solar system was
totally<00:03:47.769> different<00:03:48.220> ten<00:03:48.580> thousand<00:03:49.150> to<00:03:49.420> twelve

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:49.660 
totally different ten thousand to twelve

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:51.540 
totally different ten thousand to twelve
twenty<00:03:50.170> thousand<00:03:50.620> years<00:03:50.800> maybe<00:03:51.010> twenty<00:03:51.370> five

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:51.550 
twenty thousand years maybe twenty five

00:03:51.550 --> 00:03:54.119 
twenty thousand years maybe twenty five
thousand<00:03:52.060> years<00:03:52.180> ago<00:03:52.330> was<00:03:53.050> totally<00:03:53.739> different

00:03:54.119 --> 00:03:54.129 
thousand years ago was totally different

00:03:54.129 --> 00:03:57.509 
thousand years ago was totally different
saccharine<00:03:55.120> was<00:03:55.300> much<00:03:55.540> closer<00:03:56.200> Mars<00:03:57.099> was<00:03:57.489> much

00:03:57.509 --> 00:03:57.519 
saccharine was much closer Mars was much

00:03:57.519 --> 00:03:59.940 
saccharine was much closer Mars was much
closer<00:03:58.230> different<00:03:59.230> planets<00:03:59.620> were<00:03:59.739> further

00:03:59.940 --> 00:03:59.950 
closer different planets were further

00:03:59.950 --> 00:04:02.309 
closer different planets were further
away<00:04:00.310> it<00:04:00.550> was<00:04:00.640> a<00:04:00.730> different<00:04:01.120> configuration<00:04:01.330> so

00:04:02.309 --> 00:04:02.319 
away it was a different configuration so

00:04:02.319 --> 00:04:04.110 
away it was a different configuration so
at<00:04:02.440> night<00:04:02.739> you<00:04:02.769> will<00:04:03.129> black<00:04:03.400> out<00:04:03.580> see<00:04:03.879> this

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:04.120 
at night you will black out see this

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:06.809 
at night you will black out see this
huge<00:04:04.510> enormous<00:04:05.190> planet<00:04:06.190> with<00:04:06.310> rings<00:04:06.549> around

00:04:06.809 --> 00:04:06.819 
huge enormous planet with rings around

00:04:06.819 --> 00:04:09.809 
huge enormous planet with rings around
it<00:04:07.180> that's<00:04:07.360> how<00:04:07.599> her<00:04:07.930> sacrum<00:04:08.650> was<00:04:08.890> to<00:04:09.280> us<00:04:09.459> and

00:04:09.809 --> 00:04:09.819 
it that's how her sacrum was to us and

00:04:09.819 --> 00:04:12.240 
it that's how her sacrum was to us and
if<00:04:10.450> you<00:04:10.569> would<00:04:10.690> take<00:04:10.720> us<00:04:10.959> around<00:04:11.379> circle

00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:12.250 
if you would take us around circle

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:14.940 
if you would take us around circle
around<00:04:12.370> Saturn<00:04:13.209> and<00:04:13.390> turn<00:04:13.989> it<00:04:14.140> just<00:04:14.170> at<00:04:14.860> a

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:14.950 
around Saturn and turn it just at a

00:04:14.950 --> 00:04:17.610 
around Saturn and turn it just at a
right<00:04:15.160> angle<00:04:15.459> that<00:04:16.030> looks<00:04:16.269> like<00:04:16.419> an<00:04:16.600> eye<00:04:16.780> the

00:04:17.610 --> 00:04:17.620 
right angle that looks like an eye the

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:19.890 
right angle that looks like an eye the
eye<00:04:17.650> inside<00:04:18.609> the<00:04:18.820> circle<00:04:19.180> but<00:04:19.299> the<00:04:19.419> circle<00:04:19.780> is

00:04:19.890 --> 00:04:19.900 
eye inside the circle but the circle is

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:22.379 
eye inside the circle but the circle is
now<00:04:20.079> oblong<00:04:20.769> because<00:04:21.040> you<00:04:21.160> turn<00:04:21.430> the<00:04:21.880> angle

00:04:22.379 --> 00:04:22.389 
now oblong because you turn the angle

00:04:22.389 --> 00:04:24.450 
now oblong because you turn the angle
and<00:04:22.630> now<00:04:22.780> it<00:04:22.930> looks<00:04:23.169> like<00:04:23.260> an<00:04:23.560> eye<00:04:23.650> looking<00:04:24.220> at

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:24.460 
and now it looks like an eye looking at

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:27.960 
and now it looks like an eye looking at
you<00:04:24.720> Mars<00:04:25.720> were<00:04:26.200> told<00:04:26.530> according<00:04:27.520> to<00:04:27.700> the

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:27.970 
you Mars were told according to the

00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:31.140 
you Mars were told according to the
theory<00:04:28.540> that<00:04:28.810> is<00:04:29.139> now<00:04:29.410> being<00:04:30.130> worked<00:04:30.430> out<00:04:30.639> that

00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:31.150 
theory that is now being worked out that

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:33.510 
theory that is now being worked out that
Mars<00:04:31.600> could<00:04:31.810> very<00:04:32.320> well<00:04:32.410> have<00:04:32.830> come<00:04:33.100> through

00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:33.520 
Mars could very well have come through

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:36.200 
Mars could very well have come through
and<00:04:33.880> caused<00:04:34.300> some<00:04:34.930> kind<00:04:35.139> of<00:04:35.290> an<00:04:35.410> electrical

00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:36.210 
and caused some kind of an electrical

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:39.740 
and caused some kind of an electrical
frequency<00:04:37.210> going<00:04:37.870> between<00:04:38.260> us<00:04:38.530> and<00:04:39.039> Saturn

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:39.750 
frequency going between us and Saturn

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:42.840 
frequency going between us and Saturn

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:46.000 
jagged cuts in Mars it looks like deep

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:49.350 
jagged cuts in Mars it looks like deep
canyons<00:04:46.840> on<00:04:47.289> Mars<00:04:47.949> a<00:04:48.220> very<00:04:48.490> heavily<00:04:48.760> cut<00:04:49.180> and

00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:49.360 
canyons on Mars a very heavily cut and

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:51.840 
canyons on Mars a very heavily cut and
they<00:04:49.810> look<00:04:50.020> like<00:04:50.200> electrical<00:04:50.979> shock<00:04:51.550> waves

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:51.850

going out from it many people have

00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:57.150 
going out from it many people have
thought<00:04:54.669> that<00:04:54.940> that<00:04:55.120> was<00:04:55.360> like<00:04:55.389> where<00:04:56.160> rivers

00:04:57.150 --> 00:04:57.160 
thought that that was like where rivers

00:04:57.160 --> 00:05:00.120 
thought that that was like where rivers
of<00:04:57.490> whatever<00:04:57.700> no<00:04:58.180> no<00:04:58.600> not<00:04:58.870> at<00:04:59.020> all<00:04:59.200> they're

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:00.130 
of whatever no no not at all they're

00:05:00.130 --> 00:05:03.920 
of whatever no no not at all they're
huge<00:05:00.780> enormous<00:05:01.780> canyons<00:05:02.680> which<00:05:03.250> press<00:05:03.580> for

00:05:03.920 --> 00:05:03.930 
huge enormous canyons which press for

far far deeper all far bigger and they

00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:13.469 
far far deeper all far bigger and they

00:05:16.230 --> 00:05:16.240 
canyons of water at one time no we now

00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:18.629 
canyons of water at one time no we now
know<00:05:16.450> what<00:05:16.660> they<00:05:16.840> are<00:05:17.020> has<00:05:17.710> been<00:05:17.740> replicated

00:05:18.629 --> 00:05:18.639 
know what they are has been replicated

00:05:18.639 --> 00:05:20.580 
know what they are has been replicated
on<00:05:18.820> the<00:05:18.970> scientific<00:05:19.630> experiment<00:05:20.289> and<00:05:20.470> they

00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:20.590 
on the scientific experiment and they

00:05:20.590 --> 00:05:23.719 
on the scientific experiment and they
now<00:05:20.800> know<00:05:20.830> that<00:05:21.669> those<00:05:22.030> cuts<00:05:22.450> on<00:05:22.840> Mars<00:05:23.200> were

00:05:23.719 --> 00:05:23.729 
now know that those cuts on Mars were

00:05:23.729 --> 00:05:27.540 
now know that those cuts on Mars were
electrical<00:05:24.729> discharges<00:05:25.660> from<00:05:26.320> Mars<00:05:27.010> to

to<00:05:53.050> get<00:05:53.200> them<00:05:53.380> to<00:05:53.530> close<00:05:53.740> well<00:05:54.610> Jack<00:05:54.940> and<00:05:54.970> more

00:05:55.350 --> 00:05:55.360 
to get them to close well Jack and more

00:05:55.360 --> 00:05:58.440 
to get them to close well Jack and more
when<00:05:55.570> they<00:05:55.660> do<00:05:55.720> now<00:05:56.620> you<00:05:56.770> got<00:05:56.980> an<00:05:57.070> explosion<00:05:57.580> we

00:05:58.440 --> 00:05:58.450 
when they do now you got an explosion we

00:05:58.450 --> 00:06:01.200 
when they do now you got an explosion we
now<00:05:58.660> know<00:05:58.960> that<00:05:58.990> the<00:05:59.350> earth<00:05:59.560> as<00:05:59.860> it<00:06:00.310> rotates<00:06:00.520> as

00:06:01.200 --> 00:06:01.210 
now know that the earth as it rotates as

00:06:01.210 --> 00:06:03.150 
now know that the earth as it rotates as
the<00:06:01.540> Earth<00:06:01.690> rotates<00:06:01.930> it<00:06:02.500> generates

00:06:03.150 --> 00:06:03.160 
the Earth rotates it generates

00:06:03.160 --> 00:06:05.280 
the Earth rotates it generates
electricity<00:06:03.880> because<00:06:04.540> of<00:06:04.600> this<00:06:04.810> rotating

00:06:05.280 --> 00:06:05.290 
electricity because of this rotating

00:06:05.290 --> 00:06:07.830 
electricity because of this rotating
inside<00:06:05.620> of<00:06:06.040> its<00:06:06.190> own<00:06:06.430> atmosphere<00:06:06.850> which<00:06:07.660> is

00:06:07.830 --> 00:06:07.840 
inside of its own atmosphere which is

00:06:07.840 --> 00:06:09.980 
inside of its own atmosphere which is
causing<00:06:08.140> friction<00:06:08.590> which<00:06:09.100> gives<00:06:09.460> us<00:06:09.610> our

00:06:09.980 --> 00:06:09.990 
causing friction which gives us our

00:06:09.990 --> 00:06:13.080 
causing friction which gives us our
electrical<00:06:10.990> storms<00:06:11.470> tornadoes<00:06:11.860> is<00:06:12.700> because

00:06:13.080 --> 00:06:13.090 
electrical storms tornadoes is because

00:06:13.090 --> 00:06:15.350 
electrical storms tornadoes is because
the<00:06:13.210> earth<00:06:13.360> is<00:06:13.600> rotating<00:06:13.780> like<00:06:14.230> a<00:06:14.410> generator

00:06:15.350 --> 00:06:15.360 
the earth is rotating like a generator

00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:17.670 
the earth is rotating like a generator
generating<00:06:16.360> electricity<00:06:16.930> and<00:06:17.440> now

00:06:17.670 --> 00:06:17.680 
generating electricity and now

00:06:17.680 --> 00:06:19.800 
generating electricity and now
electricity<00:06:18.130> is<00:06:18.550> grounded<00:06:19.210> it<00:06:19.360> goes<00:06:19.570> back

00:06:19.800 --> 00:06:19.810 
electricity is grounded it goes back

00:06:19.810 --> 00:06:22.560 
electricity is grounded it goes back
into<00:06:20.080> the<00:06:20.530> ground<00:06:20.800> which<00:06:21.670> goes<00:06:21.970> down<00:06:22.240> and

00:06:22.560 --> 00:06:22.570 
into the ground which goes down and

00:06:22.570 --> 00:06:25.410 
into the ground which goes down and
heats<00:06:22.780> that<00:06:22.990> the<00:06:23.230> lava<00:06:23.770> keeping<00:06:24.610> it<00:06:24.790> hot<00:06:25.090> and

00:06:25.410 --> 00:06:25.420 
heats that the lava keeping it hot and

00:06:25.420 --> 00:06:28.350 
heats that the lava keeping it hot and
bubbling<00:06:26.050> and<00:06:26.260> so<00:06:26.890> consequently<00:06:27.400> if<00:06:27.940> another

00:06:28.350 --> 00:06:28.360 
bubbling and so consequently if another

00:06:28.360 --> 00:06:31.830 
bubbling and so consequently if another
planet<00:06:29.020> comes<00:06:29.320> close<00:06:29.830> to<00:06:30.220> us<00:06:30.490> the<00:06:31.180> electrical

00:06:31.830 --> 00:06:31.840 
planet comes close to us the electrical

00:06:31.840 --> 00:06:34.500 
planet comes close to us the electrical
frequency<00:06:32.440> our<00:06:32.800> electrical<00:06:33.520> biological<00:06:34.360> and

00:06:34.500 --> 00:06:34.510 
frequency our electrical biological and

00:06:34.510 --> 00:06:36.420 
frequency our electrical biological and
electrical<00:06:34.960> frequency<00:06:35.410> on<00:06:35.500> this<00:06:35.680> earth<00:06:35.920> would

00:06:36.420 --> 00:06:36.430 
electrical frequency on this earth would

00:06:36.430 --> 00:06:39.660 
electrical frequency on this earth would
jump<00:06:37.090> and<00:06:37.600> hit<00:06:37.840> the<00:06:37.990> other<00:06:38.140> planet<00:06:38.620> and<00:06:38.800> so

00:06:39.660 --> 00:06:39.670 
jump and hit the other planet and so

00:06:39.670 --> 00:06:41.940 
jump and hit the other planet and so
they're<00:06:39.940> now<00:06:40.240> able<00:06:40.840> to<00:06:41.290> state<00:06:41.560> that<00:06:41.590> that's

00:06:41.940 --> 00:06:41.950 
they're now able to state that that's

00:06:41.950 --> 00:06:44.520 
they're now able to state that that's
what<00:06:42.250> happened<00:06:42.670> to<00:06:42.880> Mars<00:06:43.210> Mars<00:06:43.780> must<00:06:44.230> have

00:06:44.520 --> 00:06:44.530 
what happened to Mars Mars must have

00:06:44.530 --> 00:06:46.590 
what happened to Mars Mars must have
moved<00:06:44.740> too<00:06:45.010> close<00:06:45.340> to<00:06:45.730> another<00:06:45.760> planet

00:06:46.590 --> 00:06:46.600 
moved too close to another planet

00:06:46.600 --> 00:06:49.680 
moved too close to another planet
thousands<00:06:47.470> of<00:06:47.590> years<00:06:47.830> ago<00:06:48.010> and<00:06:48.430> it<00:06:48.640> jump<00:06:49.030> this

00:06:49.680 --> 00:06:49.690 
thousands of years ago and it jump this

00:06:49.690 --> 00:06:52.650 
thousands of years ago and it jump this
part<00:06:50.020> jumped<00:06:50.440> up<00:06:50.560> at<00:06:50.770> Mars<00:06:51.070> and<00:06:51.460> shut<00:06:52.270> across

00:06:52.650 --> 00:06:52.660 
part jumped up at Mars and shut across

00:06:52.660 --> 00:06:55.650 
part jumped up at Mars and shut across
it<00:06:52.960> hit<00:06:53.140> another<00:06:53.380> planet<00:06:53.920> and<00:06:54.070> that's<00:06:54.820> why<00:06:55.240> and

00:06:55.650 --> 00:06:55.660 
it hit another planet and that's why and

00:06:55.660 --> 00:06:59.450 
it hit another planet and that's why and
at<00:06:55.930> home<00:06:56.170> and<00:06:56.740> the<00:06:57.400> Moses<00:06:57.880> then<00:06:58.060> are<00:06:58.300> many<00:06:59.080> many

00:06:59.450 --> 00:06:59.460 
at home and the Moses then are many many

00:06:59.460 --> 00:07:02.160 
at home and the Moses then are many many
asteroids<00:07:00.460> and<00:07:00.610> many<00:07:00.820> many<00:07:01.150> meteors<00:07:01.870> or

00:07:02.160 --> 00:07:02.170 
asteroids and many many meteors or

00:07:02.170 --> 00:07:05.100 
asteroids and many many meteors or
whatever<00:07:02.500> is<00:07:02.920> because<00:07:03.840> there<00:07:04.840> was<00:07:04.960> an

00:07:05.100 --> 00:07:05.110 
whatever is because there was an

00:07:05.110 --> 00:07:07.830 
whatever is because there was an
electrical<00:07:05.800> discharge<00:07:06.460> that<00:07:07.180> you<00:07:07.390> wouldn't

electrical discharge that you wouldn't

00:07:07.840 --> 00:07:09.930 
electrical discharge that you wouldn't
believe<00:07:08.050> coming<00:07:08.860> off<00:07:09.040> of<00:07:09.070> the<00:07:09.310> surface<00:07:09.760> of
