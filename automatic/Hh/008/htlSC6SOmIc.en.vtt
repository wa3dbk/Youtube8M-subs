devouring more nidus network is a

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:16.870 
devouring more nidus network is a

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:23.120 
ability is so overpowered in my opinion

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:26.349 
ability is so overpowered in my opinion
is<00:03:23.650> because<00:03:24.650> game<00:03:25.130> revolves<00:03:25.639> around<00:03:25.910> team

00:03:26.349 --> 00:03:26.359 
is because game revolves around team

00:03:26.359 --> 00:03:28.120 
is because game revolves around team
fighting<00:03:26.690> and<00:03:26.989> whenever<00:03:27.230> you<00:03:27.590> can<00:03:27.799> zone

people<00:03:28.609> out<00:03:28.760> of<00:03:28.940> a<00:03:29.060> fight<00:03:29.299> it's<00:03:29.630> quite

00:03:29.979 --> 00:03:29.989 
people out of a fight it's quite

00:03:29.989 --> 00:03:32.830 
people out of a fight it's quite
overpowered<00:03:30.739> and<00:03:30.950> it<00:03:31.639> also<00:03:31.819> allows<00:03:32.359> you<00:03:32.630> as

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:32.840 
overpowered and it also allows you as

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:35.379 
overpowered and it also allows you as
you<00:03:33.139> could<00:03:33.350> see<00:03:33.380> there<00:03:33.859> for<00:03:34.459> nice<00:03:34.670> one<00:03:34.970> become

to go into battle momentum and growth

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:14.380 
to go into battle momentum and growth
wise<00:04:12.260> because<00:04:12.709> the<00:04:13.549> fights<00:04:13.849> were<00:04:14.030> quite

00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:14.390 
wise because the fights were quite

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:17.530 
wise because the fights were quite
intensive<00:04:15.019> and<00:04:15.319> took<00:04:15.799> a<00:04:16.040> really<00:04:16.699> long<00:04:16.880> time<00:04:17.060> as
