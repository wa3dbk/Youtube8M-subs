00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:00.710 
now one of the other things you can do
is<00:02:57.629> if<00:02:57.750> you<00:02:57.780> add<00:02:58.019> additional<00:02:58.709> media<00:02:59.599> into<00:03:00.599> the

00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:00.720 
is if you add additional media into the

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:02.629 
is if you add additional media into the
timeline<00:03:01.230> you<00:03:01.799> can<00:03:01.980> manipulate<00:03:02.220> the

00:03:02.629 --> 00:03:02.639 
timeline you can manipulate the

00:03:02.639 --> 00:03:04.759 
timeline you can manipulate the
transitions<00:03:03.239> that<00:03:03.329> go<00:03:03.480> in<00:03:03.810> between<00:03:03.840> those

00:03:04.759 --> 00:03:04.769 
transitions that go in between those

00:03:04.769 --> 00:03:06.860 
transitions that go in between those
clips<00:03:05.159> so<00:03:06.060> I<00:03:06.090> went<00:03:06.299> ahead<00:03:06.359> and<00:03:06.599> added<00:03:06.689> another

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:06.870 
clips so I went ahead and added another

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:08.869 
clips so I went ahead and added another
video<00:03:07.349> and<00:03:07.590> you<00:03:07.650> can<00:03:07.769> see<00:03:07.980> this<00:03:08.129> icon<00:03:08.370> right

00:03:08.869 --> 00:03:08.879 
video and you can see this icon right

00:03:08.879 --> 00:03:10.550 
video and you can see this icon right
here<00:03:08.909> these<00:03:09.299> two<00:03:09.480> triangles<00:03:09.840> facing<00:03:10.470> each

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:10.560 
here these two triangles facing each

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:12.170 
here these two triangles facing each
other<00:03:10.709> that<00:03:11.340> lets<00:03:11.579> me<00:03:11.700> know<00:03:11.730> that<00:03:11.939> there's<00:03:12.090> a

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:12.180 
other that lets me know that there's a

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:13.929 
other that lets me know that there's a
transition<00:03:12.599> in<00:03:12.930> between<00:03:13.049> both<00:03:13.500> of<00:03:13.530> those

00:03:13.929 --> 00:03:13.939 
transition in between both of those
