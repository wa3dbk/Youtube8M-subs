hello<00:00:01.110> there<00:00:01.350> everybody<00:00:01.820> so<00:00:02.820> today<00:00:02.879> I<00:00:03.270> have<00:00:04.069> to

00:00:05.059 --> 00:00:05.069 
hello there everybody so today I have to

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:07.849 
hello there everybody so today I have to
tighten<00:00:05.339> axis<00:00:05.850> and<00:00:06.120> to<00:00:06.299> 980ti<00:00:06.990> on<00:00:07.440> my<00:00:07.589> table

00:00:07.849 --> 00:00:07.859 
tighten axis and to 980ti on my table

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:12.740 
tighten axis and to 980ti on my table
and<00:00:08.160> I've<00:00:08.970> run<00:00:09.510> some<00:00:09.750> tests<00:00:10.320> to<00:00:10.500> determine<00:00:11.750> mm

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:12.750 
and I've run some tests to determine mm

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:16.430 
and I've run some tests to determine mm
if<00:00:12.929> six<00:00:13.590> gigabytes<00:00:14.009> of<00:00:14.309> memory<00:00:14.420> is<00:00:15.420> not<00:00:16.020> enough

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:16.440 
if six gigabytes of memory is not enough

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:19.460 
if six gigabytes of memory is not enough
for<00:00:17.070> high-end<00:00:17.760> gaming<00:00:18.060> at<00:00:18.420> high<00:00:18.750> resolutions

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:19.470 
for high-end gaming at high resolutions

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:22.970 
for high-end gaming at high resolutions
such<00:00:19.710> as<00:00:19.859> 4k<00:00:20.400> and<00:00:20.670> if<00:00:21.510> you<00:00:21.660> really<00:00:22.050> do<00:00:22.260> need<00:00:22.470> 12

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:22.980 
such as 4k and if you really do need 12

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:26.570 
such as 4k and if you really do need 12
gigabytes<00:00:23.550> with<00:00:24.060> Titan<00:00:24.510> X<00:00:24.689> so<00:00:25.470> let's<00:00:25.859> have<00:00:26.519> a

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:26.580 
gigabytes with Titan X so let's have a

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:28.400 
gigabytes with Titan X so let's have a
look<00:00:26.789> at<00:00:26.910> the<00:00:27.029> results<00:00:27.570> and<00:00:27.840> I'll<00:00:28.019> walk<00:00:28.380> you

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:28.410 
look at the results and I'll walk you

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:31.490 
look at the results and I'll walk you
through<00:00:28.820> all<00:00:29.820> the<00:00:30.060> numbers<00:00:30.510> and<00:00:30.840> what<00:00:31.050> I<00:00:31.109> found

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:31.500 
through all the numbers and what I found

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:35.690 
through all the numbers and what I found
and<00:00:31.859> also<00:00:32.759> for<00:00:33.719> anyone<00:00:34.410> who<00:00:34.680> wants<00:00:35.130> to<00:00:35.190> see<00:00:35.460> for

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:35.700 
and also for anyone who wants to see for

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:38.330 
and also for anyone who wants to see for
themselves<00:00:35.790> I<00:00:36.600> have<00:00:36.719> some<00:00:37.649> video<00:00:37.950> footage

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:38.340 
themselves I have some video footage

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:42.139 
themselves I have some video footage
that<00:00:38.370> would<00:00:38.879> prove<00:00:39.270> that<00:00:40.640> what<00:00:41.640> whatever<00:00:42.000> I'm

00:00:42.139 --> 00:00:42.149 
that would prove that what whatever I'm

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:45.549 
that would prove that what whatever I'm
saying<00:00:42.450> is<00:00:42.870> absolutely<00:00:43.680> true<00:00:44.010> so<00:00:44.610> I<00:00:44.640> will

00:00:45.549 --> 00:00:45.559 
saying is absolutely true so I will

00:00:45.559 --> 00:00:49.299 
saying is absolutely true so I will
insert<00:00:46.559> a<00:00:46.770> clip<00:00:47.100> at<00:00:47.370> the<00:00:47.789> end<00:00:47.969> of<00:00:48.149> the<00:00:48.239> video<00:00:48.539> so

00:00:49.299 --> 00:00:49.309 
insert a clip at the end of the video so

00:00:49.309 --> 00:00:52.910 
insert a clip at the end of the video so
after<00:00:50.309> I'm<00:00:50.579> finished<00:00:51.180> talking<00:00:51.420> you<00:00:52.289> can<00:00:52.500> just

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
after I'm finished talking you can just

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:55.610 
after I'm finished talking you can just
stay<00:00:53.190> tuned<00:00:53.910> and<00:00:54.210> check<00:00:54.660> that<00:00:55.110> out<00:00:55.289> as<00:00:55.590> well

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:55.620 
stay tuned and check that out as well

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:59.660 
stay tuned and check that out as well
and<00:00:56.600> give<00:00:57.600> me<00:00:57.750> some<00:00:57.930> feedback<00:00:58.170> on<00:00:58.559> that<00:00:58.770> if<00:00:59.070> you

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
and give me some feedback on that if you

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:02.200 
and give me some feedback on that if you
still<00:01:00.270> like<00:01:00.510> it<00:01:00.719> in<00:01:00.960> a<00:01:01.140> comment<00:01:01.469> section<00:01:01.710> below

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:02.210 
still like it in a comment section below

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:08.000 
still like it in a comment section below
so<00:01:03.439> main<00:01:04.439> question<00:01:05.810> 6<00:01:06.810> gigabytes<00:01:07.200> versus<00:01:07.770> 12

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.010 
so main question 6 gigabytes versus 12

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:10.370 
so main question 6 gigabytes versus 12
gigabytes<00:01:08.430> because<00:01:08.700> we<00:01:09.090> all<00:01:09.270> know<00:01:09.510> if<00:01:09.869> you've

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
gigabytes because we all know if you've

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:14.420 
gigabytes because we all know if you've
seen<00:01:10.680> some<00:01:10.920> of<00:01:11.010> my<00:01:11.040> videos<00:01:11.159> so<00:01:11.760> far<00:01:12.090> that<00:01:13.430> these

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430 
seen some of my videos so far that these

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:18.050 
seen some of my videos so far that these
two<00:01:14.729> cards<00:01:15.030> they<00:01:15.630> perform<00:01:16.189> with<00:01:17.189> very<00:01:17.729> there's

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
two cards they perform with very there's

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:19.580 
two cards they perform with very there's
a<00:01:18.119> very<00:01:18.390> small<00:01:18.509> difference<00:01:19.409> in<00:01:19.530> the

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
a very small difference in the

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:22.760 
a very small difference in the
performance<00:01:19.830> at<00:01:20.580> stock<00:01:21.000> speeds<00:01:21.420> at<00:01:21.689> least<00:01:21.930> so

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
performance at stock speeds at least so

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:24.890 
performance at stock speeds at least so
what<00:01:23.070> I've<00:01:23.159> done<00:01:23.369> is<00:01:23.759> I<00:01:24.090> overclocked<00:01:24.659> them

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
what I've done is I overclocked them

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:31.270 
what I've done is I overclocked them
both<00:01:25.490> from<00:01:26.570> 1,000<00:01:27.570> base<00:01:28.200> clock<00:01:28.650> to<00:01:29.579> to<00:01:30.360> 1200

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:31.280 
both from 1,000 base clock to to 1200

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:35.300 
both from 1,000 base clock to to 1200
basically<00:01:32.280> plus<00:01:32.820> plus<00:01:33.360> 200<00:01:33.960> on<00:01:34.140> the<00:01:34.229> core<00:01:34.470> plus

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 
basically plus plus 200 on the core plus

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:40.609 
basically plus plus 200 on the core plus
400<00:01:35.970> on<00:01:36.119> a<00:01:36.150> memory<00:01:36.390> for<00:01:37.200> both<00:01:37.650> cards<00:01:39.619> which

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:40.619 
400 on a memory for both cards which

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:43.010 
400 on a memory for both cards which
means<00:01:40.650> that<00:01:41.220> they're<00:01:41.400> pretty<00:01:41.670> much<00:01:41.790> gonna<00:01:42.780> be

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
means that they're pretty much gonna be

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:49.010 
means that they're pretty much gonna be
equal<00:01:43.259> anyway<00:01:44.479> and<00:01:46.070> if<00:01:47.070> you<00:01:47.189> see<00:01:47.460> that<00:01:48.020> 980ti

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
equal anyway and if you see that 980ti

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:51.590 
equal anyway and if you see that 980ti
doesn't<00:01:49.560> boost<00:01:49.799> as<00:01:50.070> well<00:01:50.490> on<00:01:50.759> the<00:01:50.970> core<00:01:51.210> then

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600 
doesn't boost as well on the core then

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:54.109 
doesn't boost as well on the core then
that's<00:01:51.869> the<00:01:52.020> problem<00:01:52.320> of<00:01:52.799> the<00:01:53.100> card<00:01:53.399> itself<00:01:53.820> it

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:54.119 
that's the problem of the card itself it

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:55.880 
that's the problem of the card itself it
says<00:01:54.479> nothing<00:01:54.840> to<00:01:55.020> do<00:01:55.200> with<00:01:55.380> me

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:55.890 
says nothing to do with me

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:58.520 
says nothing to do with me
tweaking<00:01:56.700> a<00:01:56.880> little<00:01:57.210> bit<00:01:57.420> and<00:01:57.689> adding<00:01:58.079> just<00:01:58.229> a

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:58.530 
tweaking a little bit and adding just a

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:03.050 
tweaking a little bit and adding just a
little<00:01:59.090> bit<00:02:00.090> less<00:02:00.689> on<00:02:01.189> 980ti<00:02:02.189> core<00:02:02.610> no<00:02:02.850> I

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:03.060 
little bit less on 980ti core no I

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:03.850 
little bit less on 980ti core no I
didn't<00:02:03.420> do<00:02:03.509> that

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:03.860 
didn't do that

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:07.249 
didn't do that
the<00:02:04.860> they're<00:02:05.700> both<00:02:05.880> overclocked<00:02:06.630> exactly<00:02:07.140> the

00:02:07.249 --> 00:02:07.259 
the they're both overclocked exactly the

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:11.630 
the they're both overclocked exactly the
same<00:02:07.819> so<00:02:08.840> with<00:02:09.840> that<00:02:10.020> out<00:02:10.259> of<00:02:10.289> the<00:02:10.470> way

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:11.640 
same so with that out of the way

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:14.660 
same so with that out of the way
I<00:02:11.670> will<00:02:12.360> tell<00:02:12.540> you<00:02:12.720> what<00:02:12.930> I've<00:02:13.050> found<00:02:13.290> and<00:02:13.680> if

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:14.670 
I will tell you what I've found and if

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:21.020 
I will tell you what I've found and if
you<00:02:15.000> should<00:02:15.060> be<00:02:16.040> buying<00:02:17.040> these<00:02:17.460> or<00:02:17.880> these<00:02:20.030> if

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:21.030 
you should be buying these or these if

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:23.630 
you should be buying these or these if
they're<00:02:21.300> worth<00:02:21.540> it<00:02:21.780> so<00:02:22.560> basically<00:02:23.100> what<00:02:23.610> I

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:23.640 
they're worth it so basically what I

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:27.350 
they're worth it so basically what I
found<00:02:23.940> that<00:02:24.300> if<00:02:24.750> you<00:02:25.020> are<00:02:25.110> gaming<00:02:25.710> on<00:02:26.360> regular

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:27.360 
found that if you are gaming on regular

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:30.080 
found that if you are gaming on regular
resolutions<00:02:28.080> I<00:02:28.650> mean<00:02:29.010> not<00:02:29.220> regular<00:02:29.610> 4k

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:30.090 
resolutions I mean not regular 4k

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:33.590 
resolutions I mean not regular 4k

00:04:13.009 --> 00:04:13.019 
about 20 FPS at those settings so there

00:04:13.019 --> 00:04:16.729 
about 20 FPS at those settings so there
you<00:04:13.170> go<00:04:13.350> that<00:04:13.980> is<00:04:14.040> the<00:04:14.280> only<00:04:14.370> reason<00:04:15.709> the<00:04:16.709> only

you go that is the only reason the only

you go that is the only reason the only
reason<00:04:16.980> basically<00:04:17.519> to<00:04:18.500> go<00:04:19.500> for<00:04:20.160> titan<00:04:20.580> x<00:04:20.729> over

00:06:00.030 --> 00:06:02.300 
didn't just test Assassin's Creed unity
I<00:06:00.240> also<00:06:00.630> tested<00:06:01.110> another<00:06:01.530> game<00:06:01.800> that<00:06:01.830> is<00:06:02.280> very

00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:02.310 
I also tested another game that is very

00:06:02.310 --> 00:06:04.580 
I also tested another game that is very

pattern

00:06:08.300 --> 00:06:08.310 
pattern

00:06:08.310 --> 00:06:13.399 
pattern
basically<00:06:09.030> I<00:06:09.449> used<00:06:11.120> 4k<00:06:12.120> resolution<00:06:12.810> ultra

00:06:13.399 --> 00:06:13.409 
basically I used 4k resolution ultra

00:06:13.409 --> 00:06:18.379 
basically I used 4k resolution ultra
settings<00:06:13.800> and<00:06:16.460> hundred<00:06:17.460> and<00:06:17.580> fifty<00:06:18.180> percent

00:06:18.379 --> 00:06:18.389

00:06:18.389 --> 00:06:21.740 
settings and hundred and fifty percent
resolution<00:06:19.199> scale<00:06:19.620> which<00:06:20.460> basically<00:06:20.880> is<00:06:21.090> 6k

00:06:21.740 --> 00:06:21.750 
resolution scale which basically is 6k

00:06:21.750 --> 00:06:26.749 
resolution scale which basically is 6k
resolution<00:06:22.220> and<00:06:23.720> it<00:06:24.720> used<00:06:25.139> just<00:06:25.889> between<00:06:26.280> six

00:06:26.749 --> 00:06:26.759 
resolution and it used just between six

00:06:26.759 --> 00:06:30.740 
resolution and it used just between six
and<00:06:26.880> seven<00:06:26.970> gigabytes<00:06:28.009> both<00:06:29.009> passed<00:06:29.570> but<00:06:30.570> when

00:06:30.740 --> 00:06:30.750 
and seven gigabytes both passed but when

00:06:30.750 --> 00:06:33.230 
and seven gigabytes both passed but when
I<00:06:30.780> went<00:06:31.080> up<00:06:31.320> to<00:06:31.470> 200%<00:06:31.919> resolution<00:06:32.639> scale<00:06:32.969> in

00:06:33.230 --> 00:06:33.240 
I went up to 200% resolution scale in

00:06:33.240 --> 00:06:35.000 
I went up to 200% resolution scale in
shadow<00:06:33.479> of<00:06:33.630> Mordor

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:35.010 
shadow of Mordor

00:06:38.750 --> 00:06:38.760 
and it required close to nine gigabytes

00:06:38.760 --> 00:06:43.810 
and it required close to nine gigabytes
