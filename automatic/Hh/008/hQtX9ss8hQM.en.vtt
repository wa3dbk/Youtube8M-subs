00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:14.440 
an idea of the brightness of microlight

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:18.810 
an idea of the brightness of microlight
I'll<00:02:14.590> set<00:02:14.800> it<00:02:14.920> at<00:02:15.040> its<00:02:15.190> highest<00:02:15.400> setting<00:02:17.580> it<00:02:18.580> is

I'll set it at its highest setting it is

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:22.110 
I'll set it at its highest setting it is
a<00:02:18.989> fabulous<00:02:19.989> light<00:02:20.500> I<00:02:20.769> can<00:02:21.489> also<00:02:21.700> turn<00:02:22.060> the
