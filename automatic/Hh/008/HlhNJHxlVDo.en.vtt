empty<00:00:54.870> and<00:00:55.079> make<00:00:55.260> sure<00:00:55.410> your<00:00:55.559> truck<00:00:55.860> is<00:00:56.070> empty

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
empty and make sure your truck is empty

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:00.160 
empty and make sure your truck is empty
before<00:00:57.000> you<00:00:57.120> start<00:00:57.449> the<00:00:57.719> calibration<00:00:57.930> process

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:00.170 
before you start the calibration process

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:03.029 
before you start the calibration process
okay

00:01:03.029 --> 00:01:03.039 
okay

00:01:03.039 --> 00:01:05.189 
okay
now<00:01:03.670> what<00:01:03.879> we<00:01:04.000> need<00:01:04.030> to<00:01:04.269> do<00:01:04.420> is<00:01:04.689> we<00:01:04.809> need<00:01:04.930> to<00:01:04.989> go

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:05.199 
now what we need to do is we need to go

00:01:05.199 --> 00:01:07.410 
now what we need to do is we need to go
harvest<00:01:05.619> some<00:01:05.740> crop<00:01:06.009> so<00:01:06.880> what<00:01:07.030> you'll<00:01:07.180> need<00:01:07.299> to

00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:07.420 
harvest some crop so what you'll need to

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:08.609 
harvest some crop so what you'll need to
do<00:01:07.570> is<00:01:07.750> you'll<00:01:07.869> need<00:01:07.990> to<00:01:08.080> go<00:01:08.200> harvest

00:01:08.609 --> 00:01:08.619 
do is you'll need to go harvest

00:01:08.619 --> 00:01:10.890 
do is you'll need to go harvest
hopefully<00:01:09.369> about<00:01:09.610> a<00:01:09.640> semi<00:01:10.030> load<00:01:10.270> is<00:01:10.540> a

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:10.900 
hopefully about a semi load is a

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:13.350 
hopefully about a semi load is a
preferable<00:01:11.350> amount<00:01:11.740> and<00:01:12.369> as<00:01:12.610> you<00:01:12.820> harvest

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:13.360 
preferable amount and as you harvest

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:15.749 
preferable amount and as you harvest
this<00:01:14.020> amount<00:01:14.380> this<00:01:14.680> weight<00:01:15.009> right<00:01:15.310> here<00:01:15.520> will

00:01:15.749 --> 00:01:15.759 
this amount this weight right here will

00:01:15.759 --> 00:01:17.999 
this amount this weight right here will
be<00:01:15.909> counting<00:01:16.330> up<00:01:16.479> it'll<00:01:17.259> count<00:01:17.500> it'll<00:01:17.799> count

00:01:17.999 --> 00:01:18.009 
be counting up it'll count it'll count

00:01:18.009 --> 00:01:20.940 
be counting up it'll count it'll count
it'll<00:01:18.310> count<00:01:18.520> and<00:01:19.210> when<00:01:19.299> you<00:01:19.390> get<00:01:19.509> done<00:01:19.950> and

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:20.950 
it'll count and when you get done and

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:22.350 
it'll count and when you get done and
you've<00:01:21.100> harvested<00:01:21.340> all<00:01:21.700> that<00:01:21.880> weight<00:01:22.090> you're

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:22.360 
you've harvested all that weight you're

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:23.550 
you've harvested all that weight you're
gonna<00:01:22.420> go<00:01:22.630> to<00:01:22.690> the<00:01:22.810> next<00:01:23.080> step<00:01:23.259> now<00:01:23.409> that's

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:23.560 
gonna go to the next step now that's

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:24.570 
gonna go to the next step now that's
going<00:01:23.649> to<00:01:23.740> give<00:01:23.860> me<00:01:23.890> an<00:01:24.039> error<00:01:24.190> because<00:01:24.399> we

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:24.580 
going to give me an error because we

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:26.399 
going to give me an error because we
haven't<00:01:24.850> harvested<00:01:25.390> anything<00:01:25.780> but<00:01:26.320> when

00:01:26.399 --> 00:01:26.409 
haven't harvested anything but when

00:01:26.409 --> 00:01:27.749 
haven't harvested anything but when
you're<00:01:26.560> harvesting<00:01:26.799> you'll<00:01:27.280> have<00:01:27.460> a<00:01:27.490> weight

00:01:27.749 --> 00:01:27.759 
you're harvesting you'll have a weight

00:01:27.759 --> 00:01:29.840 
you're harvesting you'll have a weight
in<00:01:27.940> there<00:01:28.060> when<00:01:28.180> you<00:01:28.270> hit<00:01:28.420> the<00:01:28.539> next<00:01:28.810> step

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
in there when you hit the next step

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:32.999 
in there when you hit the next step
it<00:01:30.850> says<00:01:31.090> not<00:01:31.240> enough<00:01:31.299> grain<00:01:31.750> harvested<00:01:32.320> once

00:01:32.999 --> 00:01:33.009 
it says not enough grain harvested once

00:01:33.009 --> 00:01:34.590 
it says not enough grain harvested once
you<00:01:33.159> harvest<00:01:33.369> through<00:01:33.759> the<00:01:34.060> amount<00:01:34.299> of<00:01:34.420> grain

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:34.600 
you harvest through the amount of grain

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:36.149 
you harvest through the amount of grain
that<00:01:34.630> you're<00:01:35.050> gonna<00:01:35.200> send<00:01:35.619> to<00:01:35.710> the<00:01:35.830> elevator

00:01:36.149 --> 00:01:36.159 
that you're gonna send to the elevator

00:01:36.159 --> 00:01:40.559 
that you're gonna send to the elevator
for<00:01:36.429> weight<00:01:37.229> it<00:01:38.229> will<00:01:38.670> it<00:01:39.670> will<00:01:39.789> go<00:01:39.940> back<00:01:40.210> and

you'll highlight it you'll check that

00:01:51.369 --> 00:01:52.950 
you'll highlight it you'll check that
you<00:01:51.670> hit<00:01:51.819> the<00:01:51.940> checkmark<00:01:52.149> when<00:01:52.569> you<00:01:52.659> get<00:01:52.780> this

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:52.960 
you hit the checkmark when you get this

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:54.930 
you hit the checkmark when you get this
highlighted<00:01:53.409> it'll<00:01:54.220> show<00:01:54.429> the<00:01:54.580> amount<00:01:54.850> of

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:54.940 
highlighted it'll show the amount of

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:56.999 
highlighted it'll show the amount of
grain<00:01:55.119> that<00:01:55.149> you<00:01:55.360> harvested<00:01:56.080> and<00:01:56.500> then<00:01:56.890> it

00:01:56.999 --> 00:01:57.009 
grain that you harvested and then it

00:01:57.009 --> 00:02:01.080 
grain that you harvested and then it
will<00:01:57.159> also<00:01:57.369> show<00:01:57.850> a<00:01:59.310> spot<00:02:00.310> for<00:02:00.580> you<00:02:00.670> to<00:02:00.789> put<00:02:01.000> in

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:01.090 
will also show a spot for you to put in

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:02.789 
will also show a spot for you to put in
the<00:02:01.209> weight<00:02:01.390> of<00:02:01.690> the<00:02:01.810> machine<00:02:02.140> or<00:02:02.380> the<00:02:02.560> grain

00:02:02.789 --> 00:02:02.799 
the weight of the machine or the grain

00:02:02.799 --> 00:02:04.590 
the weight of the machine or the grain
that<00:02:02.920> you<00:02:03.039> sent<00:02:03.280> in<00:02:03.399> on<00:02:03.520> the<00:02:03.670> truck<00:02:03.940> you'll

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:04.600 
that you sent in on the truck you'll

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:06.120 
that you sent in on the truck you'll
enter<00:02:04.869> that<00:02:05.020> way<00:02:05.229> you'll<00:02:05.740> hit<00:02:05.860> the<00:02:05.920> enter

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:06.130 
enter that way you'll hit the enter

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:07.949 
enter that way you'll hit the enter
button<00:02:06.250> and<00:02:06.880> then<00:02:07.300> it<00:02:07.450> will<00:02:07.479> change<00:02:07.629> the

00:02:07.949 --> 00:02:07.959 
button and then it will change the

00:02:07.959 --> 00:02:09.900 
button and then it will change the
calibration<00:02:08.470> factor<00:02:08.950> automatically<00:02:09.640> and

00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:09.910 
calibration factor automatically and

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:12.030 
calibration factor automatically and
that's<00:02:10.060> how<00:02:10.209> we<00:02:10.270> do<00:02:10.450> a<00:02:10.479> yield<00:02:10.720> calibration<00:02:11.349> now

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:12.040 
that's how we do a yield calibration now

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:14.190 
that's how we do a yield calibration now
we<00:02:12.099> want<00:02:12.370> to<00:02:12.489> go<00:02:13.000> through<00:02:13.239> how<00:02:13.420> to<00:02:13.480> put<00:02:14.170> a

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:14.200 
we want to go through how to put a

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:16.110 
we want to go through how to put a
moisture<00:02:14.620> correction<00:02:15.040> in<00:02:15.190> there<00:02:15.370> let's<00:02:16.000> say

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:16.120 
moisture correction in there let's say

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:17.670 
moisture correction in there let's say
you've<00:02:16.270> been<00:02:16.300> harvesting<00:02:17.020> and<00:02:17.260> you<00:02:17.319> notice

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:17.680 
you've been harvesting and you notice

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:19.800 
you've been harvesting and you notice
that<00:02:17.709> most<00:02:18.459> of<00:02:18.580> the<00:02:18.670> time<00:02:18.879> your<00:02:19.180> moisture<00:02:19.690> is

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:19.810 
that most of the time your moisture is

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:22.860 
that most of the time your moisture is
running<00:02:20.170> somewhere<00:02:20.530> in<00:02:20.739> the<00:02:20.980> 16%<00:02:21.730> range<00:02:22.209> but

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:22.870 
running somewhere in the 16% range but

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:24.600 
running somewhere in the 16% range but
each<00:02:23.050> time<00:02:23.290> you<00:02:23.470> send<00:02:23.650> the<00:02:23.769> truck<00:02:23.980> to<00:02:24.099> town<00:02:24.310> and

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:24.610 
each time you send the truck to town and

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:29.070 
each time you send the truck to town and
have<00:02:24.970> a<00:02:25.000> checked<00:02:25.470> it's<00:02:26.470> at<00:02:26.879> 17%<00:02:27.879> so<00:02:28.569> the

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:29.080 
have a checked it's at 17% so the

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:30.930 
have a checked it's at 17% so the
combine<00:02:29.500> is<00:02:29.680> actually<00:02:30.010> a<00:02:30.069> point<00:02:30.370> low<00:02:30.580> in<00:02:30.790> that

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:30.940 
combine is actually a point low in that

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:33.240 
combine is actually a point low in that
situation<00:02:31.599> so<00:02:31.720> we<00:02:31.840> need<00:02:32.019> to<00:02:32.110> add<00:02:32.379> a<00:02:32.410> point<00:02:32.920> to

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:33.250 
situation so we need to add a point to

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:34.740 
situation so we need to add a point to
whatever<00:02:33.400> the<00:02:33.670> combine<00:02:34.090> is<00:02:34.120> showing<00:02:34.569> for

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:34.750 
whatever the combine is showing for

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:36.900 
whatever the combine is showing for
moisture<00:02:35.170> when<00:02:35.950> we<00:02:36.069> do<00:02:36.160> that<00:02:36.310> we<00:02:36.519> go<00:02:36.640> into<00:02:36.819> our

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:36.910 
moisture when we do that we go into our

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:42.150 
moisture when we do that we go into our
combine<00:02:37.480> button

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:42.160 

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:44.910 

and<00:02:42.610> we<00:02:42.700> go<00:02:42.790> to<00:02:42.850> page<00:02:43.090> four<00:02:43.480> so<00:02:44.410> we<00:02:44.500> press<00:02:44.710> this

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:44.920 
and we go to page four so we press this

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:47.430 
and we go to page four so we press this
button<00:02:45.190> till<00:02:45.490> we<00:02:45.550> get<00:02:45.670> to<00:02:45.790> page<00:02:45.940> four<00:02:46.440> now

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:47.440 
button till we get to page four now

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:49.680 
button till we get to page four now
right<00:02:47.650> here<00:02:47.800> is<00:02:47.950> our<00:02:48.070> moisture<00:02:48.460> correction<00:02:48.970> so

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:49.690 
right here is our moisture correction so

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:51.390 
right here is our moisture correction so
like<00:02:49.810> I<00:02:49.930> said<00:02:50.020> the<00:02:50.380> combines<00:02:50.800> been<00:02:51.040> showing

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:51.400 
like I said the combines been showing

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:55.620 
like I said the combines been showing
about<00:02:51.610> 16%<00:02:52.200> the<00:02:53.200> elevator<00:02:53.590> says<00:02:53.860> it's<00:02:54.040> 17%<00:02:54.940> so

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:55.630 
about 16% the elevator says it's 17% so

00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:58.610 
about 16% the elevator says it's 17% so
I<00:02:55.660> want<00:02:55.930> to<00:02:55.990> turn<00:02:56.170> my<00:02:56.350> dial<00:02:56.620> down<00:02:57.250> until<00:02:57.850> I<00:02:57.880> get

00:02:58.610 --> 00:02:58.620 
I want to turn my dial down until I get

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:01.950 
I want to turn my dial down until I get
moisture<00:02:59.620> correction<00:03:00.250> highlighted<00:03:00.870> once<00:03:01.870> I

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:01.960 
moisture correction highlighted once I

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:03.180 
moisture correction highlighted once I
get<00:03:02.080> it<00:03:02.170> highlighted<00:03:02.710> I'm<00:03:02.800> gonna<00:03:02.950> hit<00:03:03.100> the

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:03.190 
get it highlighted I'm gonna hit the

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:08.540 
get it highlighted I'm gonna hit the
check<00:03:03.400> mark<00:03:03.810> and<00:03:04.810> I'm<00:03:04.930> gonna<00:03:05.080> add<00:03:06.990> one<00:03:07.990> point

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:08.550 
check mark and I'm gonna add one point

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:10.740 
check mark and I'm gonna add one point
then<00:03:09.550> I'm<00:03:09.670> gonna<00:03:09.820> hit<00:03:09.940> the<00:03:10.030> check<00:03:10.240> mark<00:03:10.270> again

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:10.750 
then I'm gonna hit the check mark again

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:13.350 
then I'm gonna hit the check mark again
to<00:03:10.900> save<00:03:11.140> it<00:03:11.320> now<00:03:12.040> let's<00:03:12.220> say<00:03:12.370> conversely<00:03:12.760> the

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:13.360 
to save it now let's say conversely the

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:15.780 
to save it now let's say conversely the
combine<00:03:13.780> was<00:03:13.960> showing<00:03:14.290> 17%<00:03:15.130> and<00:03:15.340> the<00:03:15.460> elevator

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:15.790 
combine was showing 17% and the elevator

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:19.200 
combine was showing 17% and the elevator
said<00:03:16.090> 16%<00:03:16.930> so<00:03:17.110> I<00:03:17.170> need<00:03:17.320> to<00:03:17.410> put<00:03:17.590> a<00:03:17.620> negative<00:03:18.210> so

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:19.210 
said 16% so I need to put a negative so

00:03:19.210 --> 00:03:20.940 
said 16% so I need to put a negative so
I'll<00:03:19.570> highlight<00:03:19.810> my<00:03:20.200> Moisture<00:03:20.530> correction

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:20.950 
I'll highlight my Moisture correction

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:23.250 
I'll highlight my Moisture correction
again<00:03:21.070> with<00:03:21.460> my<00:03:21.580> dial<00:03:21.820> I'll<00:03:22.780> hit<00:03:22.930> the<00:03:23.050> check

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:23.260 
again with my dial I'll hit the check

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:27.240 
again with my dial I'll hit the check
mark<00:03:23.640> and<00:03:24.640> I'll<00:03:24.790> turn<00:03:25.060> if<00:03:25.690> it's<00:03:25.930> at<00:03:26.080> zero<00:03:26.470> then

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:27.250 
mark and I'll turn if it's at zero then

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:28.860 
mark and I'll turn if it's at zero then
I'll<00:03:27.430> turn<00:03:27.670> it<00:03:27.850> backwards<00:03:28.120> I'll<00:03:28.570> turn<00:03:28.750> it

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:28.870 
I'll turn it backwards I'll turn it

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:31.530 
I'll turn it backwards I'll turn it
counterclockwise<00:03:30.000> until<00:03:31.000> I<00:03:31.030> get<00:03:31.300> a<00:03:31.330> negative

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:31.540 
counterclockwise until I get a negative

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:33.870 
counterclockwise until I get a negative
one<00:03:31.900> in<00:03:32.050> there<00:03:32.230> I<00:03:32.440> have<00:03:32.680> my<00:03:32.710> check<00:03:33.010> mark<00:03:33.280> and

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:33.880 
one in there I have my check mark and

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:35.730 
one in there I have my check mark and
I've<00:03:34.030> successfully<00:03:34.360> sent<00:03:35.260> my<00:03:35.350> moisture

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:35.740 
I've successfully sent my moisture

00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:38.250 
I've successfully sent my moisture
correction<00:03:36.480> well<00:03:37.480> first<00:03:37.750> thing<00:03:37.900> we<00:03:38.020> want<00:03:38.200> to

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:38.260 
correction well first thing we want to

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:40.380 
correction well first thing we want to
do<00:03:38.410> when<00:03:39.070> we<00:03:39.190> do<00:03:39.310> a<00:03:39.340> header<00:03:39.580> calibration<00:03:40.240> we

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:40.390 
do when we do a header calibration we

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:41.760 
do when we do a header calibration we
have<00:03:40.510> to<00:03:40.660> do<00:03:40.810> the<00:03:40.930> feederhouse<00:03:41.320> speed

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:41.770 
have to do the feederhouse speed

00:03:41.770 --> 00:03:43.590 
have to do the feederhouse speed
calibration<00:03:42.370> first<00:03:42.640> all<00:03:43.360> of<00:03:43.510> our

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:43.600 
calibration first all of our

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:45.180 
calibration first all of our
calibrations<00:03:44.260> are<00:03:44.350> going<00:03:44.470> to<00:03:44.530> be<00:03:44.650> found<00:03:44.920> in

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:45.190 
calibrations are going to be found in

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:47.400 
calibrations are going to be found in
the<00:03:45.310> book<00:03:45.550> and<00:03:45.880> wrench<00:03:46.300> button<00:03:46.600> so<00:03:47.290> we're

the check mark to select it and notice I

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:11.070 
the check mark to select it and notice I
have<00:04:09.880> to<00:04:10.030> have<00:04:10.150> a<00:04:10.180> combine<00:04:10.600> on<00:04:10.780> level<00:04:11.050> ground

00:04:11.070 --> 00:04:11.080 
have to have a combine on level ground

00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:12.360 
have to have a combine on level ground
and<00:04:11.440> I<00:04:11.560> have<00:04:11.680> to<00:04:11.830> have<00:04:11.920> the<00:04:12.040> engine<00:04:12.340> running

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:12.370 
and I have to have the engine running

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:13.980 
and I have to have the engine running
and<00:04:12.730> hide<00:04:12.910> all<00:04:13.180> so<00:04:13.300> I'm<00:04:13.390> gonna<00:04:13.450> go<00:04:13.630> to<00:04:13.690> a<00:04:13.780> fast

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:13.990 
and hide all so I'm gonna go to a fast

00:04:13.990 --> 00:04:15.370 
and hide all so I'm gonna go to a fast
idle

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:15.380 
idle

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:17.080 
idle
I'm<00:04:15.650> gonna<00:04:15.770> come<00:04:15.950> down<00:04:15.980> to<00:04:16.280> my<00:04:16.400> inner<00:04:16.640> button

00:04:17.080 --> 00:04:17.090 
I'm gonna come down to my inner button

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:19.240 
I'm gonna come down to my inner button
which<00:04:17.450> is<00:04:17.480> here<00:04:17.930> then<00:04:18.709> I'm<00:04:18.800> gonna<00:04:18.920> hit<00:04:19.100> the

00:04:19.240 --> 00:04:19.250 
which is here then I'm gonna hit the

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:21.449 
which is here then I'm gonna hit the
checkmark

00:04:21.449 --> 00:04:21.459 
checkmark

00:04:21.459 --> 00:04:23.490 
checkmark
and<00:04:21.910> it<00:04:22.060> will<00:04:22.210> lead<00:04:22.389> me<00:04:22.570> through<00:04:22.600> the

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:23.500 
and it will lead me through the

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:25.409 
and it will lead me through the
calibration<00:04:24.070> process<00:04:24.250> so<00:04:24.729> it<00:04:24.850> says<00:04:25.030> lower<00:04:25.240> the

00:04:25.409 --> 00:04:25.419 
calibration process so it says lower the

00:04:25.419 --> 00:04:27.150 
calibration process so it says lower the
feederhouse<00:04:25.690> at<00:04:26.050> the<00:04:26.110> ground<00:04:26.350> so<00:04:26.949> I'm<00:04:27.039> going

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:27.160 
feederhouse at the ground so I'm going

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:28.770 
feederhouse at the ground so I'm going
to<00:04:27.220> lower<00:04:27.400> the<00:04:27.490> header<00:04:27.759> all<00:04:28.270> the<00:04:28.479> way<00:04:28.570> to<00:04:28.630> the

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:28.780 
to lower the header all the way to the

00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:32.040 
to lower the header all the way to the
ground<00:04:29.460> until<00:04:30.460> the<00:04:30.520> headers<00:04:31.210> all<00:04:31.630> the<00:04:31.840> weight

00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:32.050 
ground until the headers all the weight

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:36.980 
ground until the headers all the weight
is<00:04:32.259> off<00:04:32.440> of<00:04:32.620> the<00:04:32.680> hip

00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:36.990 

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:40.190 

all<00:04:37.530> right<00:04:37.680> then<00:04:38.250> I<00:04:38.340> take<00:04:38.550> my<00:04:38.580> dial<00:04:38.970> I<00:04:39.330> turned

00:04:40.190 --> 00:04:40.200 
all right then I take my dial I turned

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:43.160 
all right then I take my dial I turned
it<00:04:40.470> to<00:04:40.860> the<00:04:40.980> next<00:04:41.190> step<00:04:41.460> button<00:04:41.840> hit<00:04:42.840> the<00:04:42.930> check

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:43.170 
it to the next step button hit the check

00:04:43.170 --> 00:04:46.220 
it to the next step button hit the check
mark<00:04:43.610> now<00:04:44.610> it<00:04:44.670> says<00:04:44.940> press<00:04:45.210> and<00:04:45.480> hold<00:04:45.690> the<00:04:45.930> head

00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:46.230 
mark now it says press and hold the head

00:04:46.230 --> 00:04:48.830 
mark now it says press and hold the head
or<00:04:46.350> a<00:04:46.530> switch<00:04:46.950> so<00:04:47.910> I'm<00:04:48.000> just<00:04:48.120> gonna<00:04:48.330> press<00:04:48.600> and

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:48.840 
or a switch so I'm just gonna press and

00:04:48.840 --> 00:05:15.149 
or a switch so I'm just gonna press and
hold

00:05:15.149 --> 00:05:15.159 

00:05:15.159 --> 00:05:17.579 

now<00:05:15.639> it's<00:05:15.879> switched<00:05:16.119> to<00:05:16.989> the<00:05:17.110> header<00:05:17.319> lower

00:05:17.579 --> 00:05:17.589 
now it's switched to the header lower

00:05:17.589 --> 00:05:19.160 
now it's switched to the header lower
switch

00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:19.170 
switch

00:05:19.170 --> 00:05:20.930 
switch
press<00:05:19.770> and<00:05:19.980> not<00:05:20.130> continue<00:05:20.490> holding<00:05:20.820> the

00:05:20.930 --> 00:05:20.940 
press and not continue holding the

00:05:20.940 --> 00:05:24.989 
press and not continue holding the
header<00:05:21.120> lower<00:05:21.420> swim

00:05:24.989 --> 00:05:24.999 

00:05:24.999 --> 00:05:27.209 

and<00:05:25.509> what<00:05:25.659> the<00:05:25.779> combine<00:05:26.499> is<00:05:26.529> basically<00:05:26.979> doing

00:05:27.209 --> 00:05:27.219 
and what the combine is basically doing

00:05:27.219 --> 00:05:29.429 
and what the combine is basically doing
is<00:05:27.459> learning<00:05:27.879> that<00:05:28.029> weight<00:05:28.329> of<00:05:29.079> the<00:05:29.229> header

00:05:29.429 --> 00:05:29.439 
is learning that weight of the header

00:05:29.439 --> 00:05:31.889 
is learning that weight of the header
and<00:05:29.559> how<00:05:29.889> how<00:05:30.309> much<00:05:30.519> oil<00:05:30.759> it<00:05:31.059> has<00:05:31.239> to<00:05:31.419> allow<00:05:31.659> and

00:05:31.889 --> 00:05:31.899 
and how how much oil it has to allow and

00:05:31.899 --> 00:05:33.449 
and how how much oil it has to allow and
how<00:05:32.019> fast<00:05:32.319> to<00:05:32.559> make<00:05:32.679> the<00:05:32.739> header<00:05:32.979> go<00:05:33.159> up<00:05:33.279> and

00:05:33.449 --> 00:05:33.459 
how fast to make the header go up and

00:05:33.459 --> 00:05:35.669 
how fast to make the header go up and
down<00:05:33.549> so<00:05:34.239> now<00:05:34.360> that<00:05:34.419> says<00:05:34.659> the<00:05:34.899> calibration<00:05:35.589> is

00:05:35.669 --> 00:05:35.679 
down so now that says the calibration is

00:05:35.679 --> 00:05:38.189 
down so now that says the calibration is
complete<00:05:36.159> the<00:05:37.119> next<00:05:37.360> thing<00:05:37.509> I<00:05:37.599> want<00:05:37.809> to<00:05:37.929> do<00:05:38.019> is

00:05:38.189 --> 00:05:38.199 
complete the next thing I want to do is

00:05:38.199 --> 00:05:40.139 
complete the next thing I want to do is
I<00:05:38.289> want<00:05:38.469> to<00:05:38.529> get<00:05:38.589> my<00:05:38.769> green<00:05:38.979> highlighted<00:05:39.909> on<00:05:40.029> my

00:05:40.139 --> 00:05:40.149 
I want to get my green highlighted on my

00:05:40.149 --> 00:05:40.889 
I want to get my green highlighted on my
inner<00:05:40.329> button

00:05:40.889 --> 00:05:40.899 
inner button

00:05:40.899 --> 00:05:43.109 
inner button
and<00:05:41.319> I<00:05:41.409> hit<00:05:41.559> my<00:05:41.709> check<00:05:41.919> mark<00:05:42.189> and<00:05:42.789> that's<00:05:42.969> how

00:05:43.109 --> 00:05:43.119 
and I hit my check mark and that's how

00:05:43.119 --> 00:05:46.289 
and I hit my check mark and that's how
we<00:05:43.179> calibrate<00:05:43.659> the<00:05:43.779> feederhouse<00:05:44.049> speed<00:05:45.299> after

00:05:46.289 --> 00:05:46.299 
we calibrate the feederhouse speed after

00:05:46.299 --> 00:05:47.609 
we calibrate the feederhouse speed after
you've<00:05:46.449> done<00:05:46.599> the<00:05:46.809> feederhouse<00:05:47.139> speed

00:05:47.609 --> 00:05:47.619 
you've done the feederhouse speed

00:05:47.619 --> 00:05:48.959 
you've done the feederhouse speed
calibration<00:05:48.279> then<00:05:48.399> you<00:05:48.489> want<00:05:48.699> to<00:05:48.759> calibrate

00:05:48.959 --> 00:05:48.969 
calibration then you want to calibrate

00:05:48.969 --> 00:05:51.149 
calibration then you want to calibrate
your<00:05:49.299> header<00:05:49.569> and<00:05:50.499> you'll<00:05:50.619> need<00:05:50.739> to<00:05:50.799> do<00:05:50.979> this

00:05:51.149 --> 00:05:51.159 
your header and you'll need to do this

00:05:51.159 --> 00:05:53.009 
your header and you'll need to do this
for<00:05:51.429> each<00:05:51.459> header<00:05:51.939> but<00:05:52.239> you<00:05:52.360> only<00:05:52.509> have<00:05:52.719> to<00:05:52.869> do

00:05:53.009 --> 00:05:53.019 
for each header but you only have to do

00:05:53.019 --> 00:05:55.589 
for each header but you only have to do
it<00:05:53.199> for<00:05:53.589> each<00:05:53.769> header<00:05:54.039> one<00:05:54.369> time<00:05:54.639> as<00:05:55.389> long<00:05:55.539> as

00:05:55.589 --> 00:05:55.599 
it for each header one time as long as

00:05:55.599 --> 00:05:57.119 
it for each header one time as long as
you<00:05:55.779> don't<00:05:55.899> change<00:05:56.019> to<00:05:56.499> a<00:05:56.529> different<00:05:56.739> platform

00:05:57.119 --> 00:05:57.129 
you don't change to a different platform

00:05:57.129 --> 00:05:59.429 
you don't change to a different platform
or<00:05:57.549> different<00:05:57.879> Cornette<00:05:58.239> so<00:05:58.989> the<00:05:59.079> way<00:05:59.169> we<00:05:59.319> get

00:05:59.429 --> 00:05:59.439 
or different Cornette so the way we get

00:05:59.439 --> 00:06:01.169 
or different Cornette so the way we get
there<00:05:59.709> is<00:05:59.829> to<00:05:59.860> go<00:06:00.039> to<00:06:00.099> our<00:06:00.159> diagnostic<00:06:00.879> button

00:06:01.169 --> 00:06:01.179 
there is to go to our diagnostic button

00:06:01.179 --> 00:06:04.709 
there is to go to our diagnostic button
we<00:06:02.169> go<00:06:02.289> to<00:06:02.349> page<00:06:02.619> two<00:06:03.039> and<00:06:03.419> now<00:06:04.419> we're<00:06:04.569> going<00:06:04.659> to

once<00:06:11.009> we<00:06:11.159> get<00:06:11.249> the<00:06:11.519> header<00:06:12.059> selected<00:06:12.779> it<00:06:12.959> says

00:06:13.129 --> 00:06:13.139 
once we get the header selected it says

00:06:13.139 --> 00:06:15.109 
once we get the header selected it says

dial<00:06:22.169> I<00:06:22.469> hit<00:06:22.979> the<00:06:23.099> checkmark

00:06:24.989 --> 00:06:24.999 
dial I hit the checkmark

00:06:24.999 --> 00:06:26.759 
dial I hit the checkmark
and<00:06:25.389> it<00:06:25.509> says<00:06:25.659> lower<00:06:25.869> the<00:06:26.019> feederhouse<00:06:26.319> to<00:06:26.679> the

00:06:26.759 --> 00:06:26.769 
and it says lower the feederhouse to the

00:06:26.769 --> 00:06:28.499 
and it says lower the feederhouse to the
ground<00:06:26.979> so<00:06:27.729> I'm<00:06:27.789> gonna<00:06:27.939> lower<00:06:28.059> it<00:06:28.149> all<00:06:28.299> the<00:06:28.389> way

down<00:06:28.719> I<00:06:29.049> want<00:06:29.559> to<00:06:29.589> make<00:06:29.769> sure<00:06:29.799> all<00:06:30.129> the<00:06:30.279> weight

00:06:30.449 --> 00:06:30.459 
down I want to make sure all the weight

00:06:30.459 --> 00:06:35.320 
down I want to make sure all the weight
is<00:06:30.729> off<00:06:30.909> of<00:06:30.939> the<00:06:31.149> platform<00:06:31.629> at<00:06:31.779> that<00:06:31.899> time
