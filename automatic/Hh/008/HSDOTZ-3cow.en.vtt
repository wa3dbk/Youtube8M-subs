 We're back guys! 

00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:09.340
 Welcome to the All City Canvas videoblog 

00:00:09.340 --> 00:00:11.340
 We have many things for you today. 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:13.040
 Murals in Europe, 

00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:14.480

 our first list of the year, 

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:16.560
 and of course, 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:17.700
 our favorite section. 

00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:18.420
 So, give it! 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:19.360
 Let us begin 

00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:20.440
 where everything began: 

00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:21.460
 on the streets! 

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:23.460
 The Puerto Rican artist Alexis Diaz 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:24.400
 he is very excited 

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:25.040
 and, honestly, 

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:25.800
 we also, 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:28.640
 of having completed 18 murals 

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:30.580
 in 9 countries this year. 

00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:31.500
 And this madness 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:33.260
 it's his most recent mural 

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:34.320
 in Graz, Austria. 

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:36.660
 Another artist who walks like a globetrotter 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:38.480
 is the American artist NDA, 

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:39.780
 what he told All City Canvas 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:42.320
 of his multiple trips around the world. 

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:44.320
 He has been shaping the walls of 

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:45.740

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:46.680

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:47.820

 The Italian artist Moneyless 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:54.660
 he was in Mexico 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:56.740
 where he recreated his emblematic 

00:00:56.740 --> 00:00:58.740
 evolutionary geometry 

00:00:58.740 --> 00:01:00.740
 with Mamutt and Citizen Channel, 

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:02.740
 and he brought his wonderful creations 

00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:03.960
 to the city of Querétaro 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:05.520
 in collaboration with Balneario Tv. 

00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:07.280

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:10.300
 and left a piece 

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:11.900
 really extraordinary 

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:14.740
 in Thanon Chakrabongse street 

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:15.660

00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:17.980
 The minimalist Spanish teacher Escif, 

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:18.960
 he pulled out 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:20.440
 gigantic doric column, 

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:21.780
 entitled "Pilila", 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:22.700
 which in Spanish means ... 

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:24.580
 Congratulations 

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:26.080

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:31.620

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:33.880

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:36.700
 Let's paint Mexico. 

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:37.800
 Let's paint Mexico is 

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:38.880
 a pilot program 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:40.880
 that uses participatory workshops 

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:42.880
 to recover the public and private space, 

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:45.760
 and better the quality of life of its inhabitants. 

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:46.920
 On the walls of Łódź 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:48.920
 some very, very good works were shown 

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:50.920
 for Urban Art Forms in Poland. 

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:52.300
 The beautiful portrait made by Vhils. 

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:53.720
 The tropical mural 

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:55.720
 of the Brazilian artist NUNCA 

00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:56.660
 He brought warmth to the city. 

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:58.200
 Originally from the Siberian steppe, 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:01:59.520
 the amazing artist Morik, 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:02.000
 Plasma this beauty on a wall. 

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:03.460
 The Australian artist 

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:05.080
 David "Meggs" Hook 

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:07.840
 finished this powerful and colorful mural 

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:08.820
 in Detroit. 

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:10.820
 The great Blu recently finished 

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:11.780
 a mural that covers 

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:14.220
 the entire side of a house in the Italian capital. 

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:15.940
 According to Artnet News, 

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:17.440
 the huge mural shows 

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:18.700
 a cargo ship 

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:22.640
 full of cranes and excavators, 

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:23.640
 that is being attacked by 

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:25.960
 a regiment of soldiers with red flags. 

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:27.320
 As we all know, 

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:28.100
 the work of Blu 

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:29.420
 often deals with political issues 

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:32.740
 and directly reflects the area in which it is painted. 

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:33.540
 Now, 

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:35.320
 start praying, 

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:36.100
 why, 

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:37.100
 according to "The Local", 

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:39.140

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:45.980
 in 2007 and 2008 

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:47.980
 they can be demolished 

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:50.580

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:51.820

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:53.640
 A p!!% * Apartment complex! 

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:54.900
 From the streets, 

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:56.560
 we go to the galleries. 

00:02:58.480 --> 00:02:59.880

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:06.100
 in the gallery Magda Danysz. 

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:07.960

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:12.420

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:07.700
 of the world of contemporary art. 

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:09.420
 In October 2011, 

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:10.920
 the magazine was criticized 

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:12.920
 by the Chinese government 

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:14.920
 for choosing Ai Wei Wei as number 1 

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:15.560
 from the Power 100 list. 

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:17.820
 And now that November has arrived, 

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:19.900
 I want to tell you who is in number 1, 

00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:21.600

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:23.780
 and all the surprises that are among them. 

00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:25.000

00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:33.360
 The museum of contemporary and modern art 

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:35.360
 most visited in the world. 

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:38.700
 This jump was Olympic! 

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:40.840
 The "balloon dog millionaire", 

00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:42.560
 as well described by ArtReview, 

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:43.680
 Jeff Koons 

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:45.680
 went from position 56 

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:47.340
 in 2013 

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:47.840

 He is a great promoter 

00:05:10.420 --> 00:05:12.100
 to bring art to the masses. 

00:05:12.100 --> 00:05:13.460
 Their mouths were water 

00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:15.460
 with Sego's Peruvian ceviche, 

00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:16.540
 and they enjoyed it with a 

00:05:16.540 --> 00:05:19.260
 Gin &amp; tonic in the style of Smithe. 

00:05:19.620 --> 00:05:20.980
 Now, get ready 

00:05:20.980 --> 00:05:21.900

 If you enter the adventurous spirit, 

00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:31.500
 and they want to try something different, 

00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:33.240
 and they happen to be in Istambul, 

00:05:33.340 --> 00:05:36.620
 Do not stop eating at Karakoy Lokantasi 

00:05:36.980 --> 00:05:40.320
 and order the delicious lamb with green beans. 

00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:41.840
 If you want to go to dinner, 

00:05:41.840 --> 00:05:43.840
 Do not forget to make a reservation. 

00:05:43.840 --> 00:05:44.720
 OR 

00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:46.720
 get on a plane to Paris, 

00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:48.020
 and prepare for 

00:05:48.020 --> 00:05:49.100
 spend a good pasta 

00:05:49.100 --> 00:05:50.540
 - as the artist describes well- 

00:05:50.540 --> 00:05:51.840
 and make a reservation 

00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:53.500
 in Le Dauphin. 

00:05:53.500 --> 00:05:56.340
 They have to ask for the Beratta 

00:05:56.340 --> 00:05:57.820
 and let the sommelier 

00:05:57.820 --> 00:05:59.460
 I recommend the perfect wine 

00:05:59.460 --> 00:06:00.920
