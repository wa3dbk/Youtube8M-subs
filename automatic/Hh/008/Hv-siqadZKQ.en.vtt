we'll<00:02:13.440> see<00:02:13.560> the<00:02:13.680> side<00:02:13.860> I<00:02:13.890> am<00:02:14.040> right<00:02:14.310> now<00:02:14.460> I<00:02:14.730> try

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:16.590 
to keep him away from that time because

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:18.020 
to keep him away from that time because
it's<00:02:16.740> not<00:02:16.860> the<00:02:17.010> best<00:02:17.160> place<00:02:17.280> to<00:02:17.520> be<00:02:17.640> a<00:02:17.670> try<00:02:17.910> and

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:18.030 
it's not the best place to be a try and

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:19.460 
it's not the best place to be a try and
keep<00:02:18.090> them<00:02:18.240> next<00:02:18.480> to<00:02:18.540> the<00:02:18.630> sea<00:02:18.810> flag<00:02:19.080> because<00:02:19.410> a

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:19.470 
keep them next to the sea flag because a

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:21.650 
keep them next to the sea flag because a
really<00:02:19.950> wide<00:02:20.160> open<00:02:20.460> area<00:02:20.640> it's<00:02:21.030> kind<00:02:21.480> of<00:02:21.510> an

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:21.660 
really wide open area it's kind of an

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:23.720 
really wide open area it's kind of an
easier<00:02:21.960> place<00:02:22.200> to<00:02:22.230> control<00:02:22.800> and<00:02:23.040> just<00:02:23.190> be

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:23.730 
easier place to control and just be

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:26.030 
easier place to control and just be
around<00:02:24.000> unlike<00:02:24.810> that<00:02:24.960> a<00:02:25.170> area<00:02:25.560> what's<00:02:25.770> really

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:26.040 
around unlike that a area what's really

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:27.260 
around unlike that a area what's really
kind<00:02:26.190> of<00:02:26.280> small<00:02:26.580> and<00:02:26.790> there's<00:02:26.910> one<00:02:27.060> bill

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:27.270 
kind of small and there's one bill

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:29.120 
kind of small and there's one bill
people<00:02:27.780> just<00:02:27.930> like<00:02:28.050> to<00:02:28.110> sit<00:02:28.410> in<00:02:28.440> all<00:02:28.710> day<00:02:28.890> and

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:29.130 
people just like to sit in all day and

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:31.160 
people just like to sit in all day and
not<00:02:29.400> move<00:02:29.670> around<00:02:29.880> and<00:02:30.120> so<00:02:30.300> really<00:02:30.720> I'm<00:02:31.110> just

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:31.170 
not move around and so really I'm just

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:32.960 
not move around and so really I'm just
keep<00:02:31.830> them<00:02:31.980> around<00:02:32.040> the<00:02:32.310> sea<00:02:32.460> flag<00:02:32.700> it's<00:02:32.880> the

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:32.970 
keep them around the sea flag it's the

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:34.130 
keep them around the sea flag it's the
best<00:02:33.150> thing<00:02:33.210> to<00:02:33.330> do<00:02:33.510> especially<00:02:33.630> if<00:02:34.020> you're

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:34.140 
best thing to do especially if you're

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:35.540 
best thing to do especially if you're
running<00:02:34.320> the<00:02:34.500> lodestar<00:02:34.920> wasn't<00:02:35.280> doing<00:02:35.520> that
