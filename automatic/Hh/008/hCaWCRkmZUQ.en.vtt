like high-rise as you can see from the

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:13.700 
like high-rise as you can see from the
picture<00:00:10.980> just<00:00:11.460> based<00:00:11.700> on<00:00:11.880> this<00:00:12.470> same<00:00:13.470> kind<00:00:13.680> of

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:13.710 
picture just based on this same kind of

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:16.430 
picture just based on this same kind of
principle<00:00:14.300> different<00:00:15.300> map<00:00:15.450> together<00:00:16.230> all

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:16.440 
principle different map together all

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:19.100 
principle different map together all
together<00:00:16.560> but<00:00:17.039> same<00:00:17.430> kind<00:00:17.640> of<00:00:17.670> principle<00:00:18.110> it's

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:19.110 
together but same kind of principle it's

00:00:19.110 --> 00:00:21.910 
together but same kind of principle it's
an<00:00:19.230> open<00:00:19.560> building<00:00:20.070> construction<00:00:20.700> site<00:00:20.940> as

00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:21.920 
an open building construction site as

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:24.410 
an open building construction site as
you<00:00:22.920> can<00:00:23.039> see<00:00:23.220> here<00:00:23.520> there's<00:00:23.880> a<00:00:23.940> lot<00:00:24.180> of<00:00:24.330> the

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:24.420 
you can see here there's a lot of the

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:28.460 
you can see here there's a lot of the
same<00:00:24.600> features<00:00:25.310> open<00:00:26.310> columns<00:00:27.050> ever<00:00:28.050> it's<00:00:28.230> not

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:28.470 
same features open columns ever it's not

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:30.260 
same features open columns ever it's not
exactly<00:00:28.890> the<00:00:28.980> same<00:00:29.250> map<00:00:29.460> it's<00:00:29.850> not<00:00:30.029> even

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:30.270 
exactly the same map it's not even

00:00:30.270 --> 00:00:34.069 
exactly the same map it's not even
really<00:00:30.420> a<00:00:30.539> remake<00:00:32.149> just<00:00:33.149> the<00:00:33.300> incorporated<00:00:33.810> a

00:00:34.069 --> 00:00:34.079 
really a remake just the incorporated a

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:37.420 
really a remake just the incorporated a
lot<00:00:34.649> of<00:00:34.770> the<00:00:34.860> same<00:00:35.070> ideas<00:00:35.190> into<00:00:35.940> this<00:00:36.030> map

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:37.430 
lot of the same ideas into this map

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:39.650 
lot of the same ideas into this map
alright<00:00:38.430> so<00:00:38.730> I'm<00:00:38.850> gonna<00:00:38.970> work<00:00:39.120> my<00:00:39.180> way<00:00:39.540> around

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:39.660 
alright so I'm gonna work my way around

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:42.200 
alright so I'm gonna work my way around
the<00:00:39.960> outside<00:00:40.350> of<00:00:40.380> the<00:00:40.500> map<00:00:40.649> first<00:00:41.210> and

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210 
the outside of the map first and

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:44.299 
the outside of the map first and
actually<00:00:42.510> get<00:00:42.630> on<00:00:42.750> top<00:00:42.960> of<00:00:42.989> that<00:00:43.260> if<00:00:44.040> you<00:00:44.190> know

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:44.309 
actually get on top of that if you know

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:48.740 
actually get on top of that if you know
the<00:00:44.370> right<00:00:44.550> jumps<00:00:46.790> you<00:00:47.790> can<00:00:47.850> see<00:00:48.149> here<00:00:48.510> there's

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:48.750 
the right jumps you can see here there's

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:51.319 
the right jumps you can see here there's
some<00:00:48.989> turned<00:00:49.590> over<00:00:49.860> cylinders<00:00:50.430> concrete

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:51.329 
some turned over cylinders concrete

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:57.470 
some turned over cylinders concrete
cylinders<00:00:52.820> the<00:00:53.820> middle<00:00:55.730> not<00:00:56.730> much<00:00:56.940> going<00:00:57.180> on

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
cylinders the middle not much going on

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:00.799 
cylinders the middle not much going on
a<00:00:57.660> lot<00:00:58.289> of<00:00:58.320> close<00:00:58.649> quarters<00:00:59.039> combat<00:00:59.690> and<00:01:00.690> their

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809 
a lot of close quarters combat and their

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:04.039 
a lot of close quarters combat and their
building<00:01:01.140> going<00:01:01.260> on<00:01:01.440> here<00:01:02.660> pretty<00:01:03.660> much<00:01:03.809> the

00:01:04.039 --> 00:01:04.049 
building going on here pretty much the

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:08.060 
building going on here pretty much the
same<00:01:04.229> thing<00:01:04.440> on<00:01:04.530> the<00:01:04.589> other<00:01:04.619> side<00:01:07.070> fairly

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
same thing on the other side fairly

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:12.840 
same thing on the other side fairly
symmetrical<00:01:08.580> map

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:12.850 

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:14.800 

all<00:01:13.850> right<00:01:13.940> so<00:01:14.150> now<00:01:14.240> I'm<00:01:14.330> gonna<00:01:14.450> work<00:01:14.600> my<00:01:14.780> way

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:14.810 
all right so now I'm gonna work my way

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:17.440 
all right so now I'm gonna work my way
back<00:01:15.200> towards<00:01:15.560> the<00:01:15.680> center<00:01:16.300> there's<00:01:17.300> an

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:17.450 
back towards the center there's an

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:19.090 
back towards the center there's an
underground<00:01:17.780> tunnel<00:01:18.140> here<00:01:18.650> that<00:01:18.770> you<00:01:18.860> can<00:01:18.980> go

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:19.100 
underground tunnel here that you can go

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:22.090 
underground tunnel here that you can go
through<00:01:19.960> and<00:01:20.960> that's<00:01:21.260> gonna<00:01:21.560> be<00:01:21.740> a<00:01:21.770> bit<00:01:21.920> of<00:01:22.010> a

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:22.100 
through and that's gonna be a bit of a

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:23.890 
through and that's gonna be a bit of a
shortcut<00:01:22.430> to<00:01:22.760> get<00:01:22.910> from<00:01:23.180> one<00:01:23.330> side<00:01:23.570> to<00:01:23.840> the

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:23.900 
shortcut to get from one side to the

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:29.620 
shortcut to get from one side to the
other<00:01:27.460> all<00:01:28.460> right<00:01:28.640> so<00:01:28.940> there's<00:01:29.300> a<00:01:29.390> few

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:29.630 
other all right so there's a few

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:36.000 
other all right so there's a few
buildings<00:01:29.840> back<00:01:30.410> here<00:01:30.710> that<00:01:30.860> you<00:01:30.920> can<00:01:31.040> go<00:01:31.250> in

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:36.010 

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:40.120 

and<00:01:37.600> then<00:01:38.600> that's<00:01:39.170> pretty<00:01:39.440> much<00:01:39.500> gonna<00:01:39.710> sum<00:01:40.010> up

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:40.130 
and then that's pretty much gonna sum up

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:43.140 
and then that's pretty much gonna sum up
this<00:01:40.340> map<00:01:40.580> again<00:01:40.910> it's<00:01:41.300> a<00:01:41.360> really<00:01:41.780> small<00:01:42.050> map

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:43.150 
this map again it's a really small map

00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:45.880 
this map again it's a really small map
the<00:01:44.150> pipeline's<00:01:44.630> gonna<00:01:44.869> be<00:01:45.050> a<00:01:45.080> big<00:01:45.410> help<00:01:45.619> if

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:45.890 
the pipeline's gonna be a big help if

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:48.460 
the pipeline's gonna be a big help if
you're<00:01:46.010> just<00:01:46.220> starting<00:01:46.869> just<00:01:47.869> if<00:01:48.050> you<00:01:48.140> go<00:01:48.290> in

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:48.470 
you're just starting just if you go in

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:50.020 
you're just starting just if you go in
there<00:01:48.680> make<00:01:48.860> sure<00:01:48.920> you<00:01:49.130> have<00:01:49.280> a<00:01:49.310> submachine

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:50.030 
there make sure you have a submachine

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:52.870 
there make sure you have a submachine
gun<00:01:50.210> or<00:01:50.420> shotgun<00:01:51.490> basically<00:01:52.490> any<00:01:52.640> kind<00:01:52.820> of

00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:52.880 
gun or shotgun basically any kind of

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:55.900 
gun or shotgun basically any kind of
close<00:01:53.090> quarter<00:01:53.479> combat<00:01:53.510> weapon<00:01:54.910> that's

00:01:55.900 --> 00:01:55.910 
close quarter combat weapon that's

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:58.810 
close quarter combat weapon that's
pretty<00:01:56.210> much<00:01:56.300> it<00:01:56.450> for<00:01:56.479> this<00:01:56.690> map<00:01:57.520> again<00:01:58.520> pretty

00:01:58.810 --> 00:01:58.820 
pretty much it for this map again pretty

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:01.090 
pretty much it for this map again pretty
small<00:01:59.150> map<00:01:59.420> good<00:02:00.200> for<00:02:00.410> small<00:02:00.650> team-based

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:01.100 
small map good for small team-based

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:01.900 
small map good for small team-based
