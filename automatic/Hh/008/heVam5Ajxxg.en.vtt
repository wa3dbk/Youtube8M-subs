 about your car the rodrigo is a 

00:00:47.149 --> 00:00:50.570
 of the pilots participating in the Cup

 center-west who lost the 

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:54.980
 first you drive what is your car 

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:57.380
 and which categories participate in the 

00:00:54.980 --> 00:01:01.940
 car opala diplomat 86 

00:00:57.380 --> 00:01:05.119
 the two doors is beautiful, right 14.1 

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:07.640
 original I participate in the theory that is 

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:09.530
 bring original and category gts that the 

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:11.840
 super back to see just us 

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:13.970
 take a question here for the guys who do not 

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:15.860
 understand a lot do not know until there is 

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:17.600
 any difference of theory as you are 

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:19.159
 your car to make any difference 

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:20.929
 in it to you 

00:01:19.159 --> 00:01:23.719
 good is in my case only thing that I 

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:25.789
 changed from one category to another is the 

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:30.079
 tire until the tire allows a more 

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:32.149
 large and larger is also the 

00:01:30.079 --> 00:01:34.460
 nitromethane not blown with metal 

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:37.759
 new natel you run of pure epul metal 

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:39.409
 until the pure metal right so let's talk 

00:01:37.759 --> 00:01:41.210
 a little respect now from the engine 

00:01:39.409 --> 00:01:42.710
 your car configuration that it uses 

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:45.020
 and said that he uses a six engine 

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:46.939
 cylinders 14.1 he is using a 

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:49.429
 electronic injection that is no longer 

00:01:46.939 --> 00:01:52.609
 carburetor is not injected is with 6 

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:55.280
 6 butterfly nozzle head also the 

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:58.300
 working outside was defended curitiba with 

00:01:55.280 --> 00:02:00.850
 152 efects 

00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:04.120
 it is all worked, not the part of the block and 

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:05.980
 if it is the same l tragic l was changed 

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:08.410
 only thing here and connecting rod 

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:10.690
 forged condominium that gives a little more 

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:13.000
 Old slightly improves his fee and 

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:15.010
 basically this and any injection 

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:17.740
 that its use and presidential the beaks to 

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:20.920
 I'm using injection pulse is right and 

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:23.280
 manages all sep peaks is and pistons 

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:28.060
 What brand is the brand you are using there? 

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:30.010
 oab is skate and epsilon ii apel and elvira 

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:31.360
 original pirate original 

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:33.040
 You also see that you have some 

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:34.510
 thing in the ignition there but then he is also 

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:35.800
 all my original and if you work with 

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:38.320
 distributor nÃ© 

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:40.180
 You have a cool reel and have a 

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:42.070
 so much it is a module so much that the 

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:45.460
 itself will remain and this has a way 

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:47.770
 and amplifies the coil cables 

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:49.810
 cars improved a bit and in relation to 

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:52.870
 to now the question of the exchange that you 

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:54.280
 uses is from the exchange date 

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:56.470
 transmission and differential 

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:58.600
 using exchange he looks at exchange to us 

00:02:56.470 --> 00:03:00.850
 touched crusader dot net is what mike 

00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:03.850
 better has a very good relationship 

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:07.300
 is the differential is the dana 44 with 

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:10.660
 relationship is already 409 which is a bit more 

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:12.610
 short and the suspension is this law of 

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:14.440
 neighborhood in this relationship of speaking on account of 

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:17.170
 the size of the clue is this 

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:19.660
 formerly wore pre 3 72 was very 

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:20.170
 I lost so I spent very slow in 

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:21.580
 Last 

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:23.170
 now with this mother cut a little 

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:25.180
 improved final speed 

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:26.709
 wonder about the weather that is 

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:29.470
 here is making time today in 

00:03:26.709 --> 00:03:31.870
 track is listening and 183 in the last 

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:33.640
 championship stage, but now we give 

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:35.800
 an improvement in the head and hope to turn 

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:37.120
 The rhythm then has one more detail is that 

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:39.070
 I could not finish the matter without 

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:40.690
 ask rodrigo which is the power of the 

00:03:39.070 --> 00:03:42.190
 car everybody wants to know what it's about 

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:43.180
 you have power in your car nowadays 

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:45.160
 the cavalry 

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:47.860
 Look, we did not hurt yet, but it's me. 

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:49.780
 I believe in 350 400 out there 

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:51.520
 A wonder, we'll keep up. 

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:53.140

00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:55.090

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:38.530
