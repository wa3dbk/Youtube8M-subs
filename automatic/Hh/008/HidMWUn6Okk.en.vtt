00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 
probably the last sign that their backs

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:25.070 
probably the last sign that their backs
will<00:01:22.830> be<00:01:22.979> together<00:01:23.159> in<00:01:23.549> this<00:01:23.670> way<00:01:23.880> for<00:01:24.689> another

the batch is able to make that bus for

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:39.499 
the batch is able to make that bus for
the<00:01:36.600> 21st<00:01:37.520> you<00:01:38.520> normally<00:01:38.850> get<00:01:39.000> a<00:01:39.030> pretty<00:01:39.329> good

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509 
the 21st you normally get a pretty good

percent of some batches so this is the

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:46.789 
percent of some batches so this is the
