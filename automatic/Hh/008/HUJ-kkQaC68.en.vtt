00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:07.409 
that look when he fought Lennox Lewis in

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:09.590 
that look when he fought Lennox Lewis in
he<00:02:08.069> never<00:02:08.220> took<00:02:08.399> a<00:02:08.520> risky

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:09.600 
he never took a risky

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:11.450 
he never took a risky
he<00:02:09.810> wasn't<00:02:10.050> prepared<00:02:10.350> to<00:02:10.410> cross<00:02:10.620> the<00:02:10.770> line<00:02:10.920> he

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:11.460 
he wasn't prepared to cross the line he

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:12.530 
he wasn't prepared to cross the line he
did<00:02:11.640> the<00:02:11.760> other<00:02:11.880> night<00:02:12.000> if<00:02:12.240> he<00:02:12.330> does<00:02:12.510> that

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:12.540 
did the other night if he does that

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:14.090 
did the other night if he does that
again<00:02:12.810> I<00:02:12.990> think<00:02:13.230> that<00:02:13.320> he<00:02:13.380> can<00:02:13.440> be<00:02:13.560> heavyweight

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:14.100 
again I think that he can be heavyweight

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:15.740 
again I think that he can be heavyweight
champion<00:02:14.550> of<00:02:14.580> the<00:02:14.640> world<00:02:14.700> something<00:02:15.540> that<00:02:15.660> you

every<00:03:56.250> other<00:03:56.400> division<00:03:56.910> I<00:03:57.060> still<00:03:58.020> find<00:03:58.170> it

00:03:58.280 --> 00:03:58.290 
every other division I still find it

00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:00.560

hard to go past my Tyson yeah i just

00:04:00.570 --> 00:04:03.320 
hard to go past my Tyson yeah i just
think<00:04:00.870> was<00:04:00.990> so<00:04:01.170> devastating<00:04:01.920> speed<00:04:02.670> pal<00:04:03.030> and

think was so devastating speed pal and

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:05.540 
think was so devastating speed pal and
and<00:04:03.600> that<00:04:04.320> is<00:04:04.470> best<00:04:04.740> forget<00:04:05.130> about<00:04:05.220> what<00:04:05.490> he

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:05.550 
and that is best forget about what he

00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:07.700 
and that is best forget about what he
done<00:04:05.730> in<00:04:06.060> towards<00:04:06.390> the<00:04:06.690> end<00:04:06.900> or<00:04:07.110> in<00:04:07.290> betweens

00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:07.710 
done in towards the end or in betweens

00:04:07.710 --> 00:04:09.320 
done in towards the end or in betweens
but<00:04:07.950> that<00:04:08.190> is<00:04:08.310> bear<00:04:08.550> suggesting<00:04:09.030> that<00:04:09.180> he<00:04:09.240> was

00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:09.330 
but that is bear suggesting that he was

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:12.110
