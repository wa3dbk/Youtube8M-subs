although they may be pasteurized unless

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:41.630 
although they may be pasteurized unless
you<00:00:40.500> maybe<00:00:40.649> get<00:00:40.860> them<00:00:40.980> direct<00:00:41.340> from<00:00:41.520> the

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:41.640 
you maybe get them direct from the

that<00:03:05.250> I've<00:03:05.580> harvested<00:03:05.820> so<00:03:06.450> I<00:03:06.480> just<00:03:06.900> got

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:07.410 
that I've harvested so I just got

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:09.680 
that I've harvested so I just got
finished<00:03:07.830> harvesting<00:03:08.489> all<00:03:09.000> the<00:03:09.180> olives<00:03:09.510> we

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:09.690 
finished harvesting all the olives we

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:11.150 
finished harvesting all the olives we
have<00:03:09.810> several<00:03:10.050> pounds<00:03:10.380> of<00:03:10.560> olives<00:03:10.890> here<00:03:11.010> in

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:11.160 
have several pounds of olives here in

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:12.500 
have several pounds of olives here in
this<00:03:11.280> paper<00:03:11.489> bag<00:03:11.730> you<00:03:11.940> could<00:03:12.060> check<00:03:12.270> them<00:03:12.390> out

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:12.510 
this paper bag you could check them out

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:15.320 
this paper bag you could check them out
all<00:03:12.750> fresh<00:03:13.620> right<00:03:13.980> off<00:03:14.130> the<00:03:14.280> tree<00:03:14.610> so<00:03:15.030> the<00:03:15.120> next

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:15.330 
all fresh right off the tree so the next

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:17.180 
all fresh right off the tree so the next
step<00:03:15.540> is<00:03:15.690> we<00:03:15.840> need<00:03:15.870> to<00:03:16.110> get<00:03:16.260> the<00:03:16.470> items<00:03:16.860> that<00:03:16.980> we

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:17.190 
step is we need to get the items that we

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:19.759 
step is we need to get the items that we
need<00:03:17.340> to<00:03:17.489> preserve<00:03:17.640> the<00:03:18.150> olives<00:03:18.540> so<00:03:18.930> the<00:03:19.560> next

00:03:19.759 --> 00:03:19.769 
need to preserve the olives so the next

00:03:19.769 --> 00:03:21.050 
need to preserve the olives so the next
step<00:03:19.950> is<00:03:20.130> we're<00:03:20.250> going<00:03:20.340> to<00:03:20.400> go<00:03:20.580> to<00:03:20.640> the<00:03:20.760> store

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:21.060 
step is we're going to go to the store

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:23.210 
step is we're going to go to the store
and<00:03:21.269> get<00:03:21.690> the<00:03:21.810> stuff<00:03:22.049> we<00:03:22.200> need<00:03:22.230> so<00:03:22.769> now<00:03:23.010> we're

00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:23.220 
and get the stuff we need so now we're

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:25.460 
and get the stuff we need so now we're
at<00:03:23.370> my<00:03:23.549> local<00:03:23.970> health<00:03:24.269> food<00:03:24.420> store<00:03:24.600> and<00:03:25.230> we<00:03:25.350> got

00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:25.470 
at my local health food store and we got

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:27.110 
at my local health food store and we got
to<00:03:25.620> get<00:03:25.709> salt<00:03:26.250> so<00:03:26.700> they<00:03:26.820> have<00:03:26.910> several

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:27.120 
to get salt so they have several

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:28.490 
to get salt so they have several
different<00:03:27.450> kinds<00:03:27.690> of<00:03:27.750> salts<00:03:28.049> here<00:03:28.320> in<00:03:28.410> the

00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:28.500 
different kinds of salts here in the

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:31.580 
different kinds of salts here in the
bowl<00:03:28.709> bins<00:03:29.670> so<00:03:30.120> they<00:03:30.239> have<00:03:30.390> the<00:03:30.540> real<00:03:30.780> natural

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:31.590 
bowl bins so they have the real natural

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:34.160 
bowl bins so they have the real natural
mineral<00:03:32.190> real<00:03:32.430> salt<00:03:32.790> and<00:03:33.060> this<00:03:33.360> is<00:03:33.540> a<00:03:33.570> mined<00:03:33.989> in

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:34.170 
mineral real salt and this is a mined in

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:36.170 
mineral real salt and this is a mined in
Utah<00:03:34.680> but<00:03:35.340> we<00:03:35.430> don't<00:03:35.580> want<00:03:35.730> that<00:03:35.790> then<00:03:36.090> they

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:36.180 
Utah but we don't want that then they

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:39.199 
Utah but we don't want that then they
have<00:03:36.299> the<00:03:36.420> fine<00:03:36.900> sea<00:03:37.440> salt<00:03:37.470> solar<00:03:38.310> evaporated

00:03:39.199 --> 00:03:39.209 
have the fine sea salt solar evaporated

00:03:39.209 --> 00:03:40.880 
have the fine sea salt solar evaporated
and<00:03:39.480> we<00:03:40.170> don't<00:03:40.350> want<00:03:40.470> that<00:03:40.590> either<00:03:40.650> because

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:40.890 
and we don't want that either because

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:43.070 
and we don't want that either because
it's<00:03:41.100> too<00:03:41.280> fine<00:03:41.580> and<00:03:41.850> next<00:03:42.420> here<00:03:42.600> we<00:03:42.720> have<00:03:42.930> the

00:03:43.070 --> 00:03:43.080 
it's too fine and next here we have the

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:45.740 
it's too fine and next here we have the
coarse<00:03:43.560> sea<00:03:43.950> salt<00:03:44.239> that's<00:03:45.239> the<00:03:45.330> one<00:03:45.480> we've<00:03:45.630> all

00:06:32.580 --> 00:06:34.850 
and there's some water left over and
some<00:06:32.909> salt<00:06:33.270> so<00:06:34.020> at<00:06:34.110> this<00:06:34.229> point<00:06:34.529> where<00:06:34.770> you're

00:06:34.850 --> 00:06:34.860 
some salt so at this point where you're

00:06:34.860 --> 00:06:36.409 
some salt so at this point where you're
going<00:06:34.919> to<00:06:35.039> carefully<00:06:35.279> do<00:06:35.580> is<00:06:35.700> basically<00:06:35.909> sieve

00:06:36.409 --> 00:06:36.419 
going to carefully do is basically sieve

00:06:36.419 --> 00:06:38.719 
going to carefully do is basically sieve
off<00:06:36.659> all<00:06:36.930> the<00:06:37.110> olives<00:06:37.529> put<00:06:38.310> them<00:06:38.430> into<00:06:38.580> a

00:06:38.719 --> 00:06:38.729 
off all the olives put them into a

00:06:38.729 --> 00:06:39.340 
off all the olives put them into a
storage

00:06:39.340 --> 00:06:39.350 
storage

00:06:39.350 --> 00:06:41.230 
storage
Jarre<00:06:39.680> and<00:06:39.920> then<00:06:40.340> you're<00:06:40.460> able<00:06:40.580> to<00:06:40.730> store<00:06:41.060> them

00:06:41.230 --> 00:06:41.240 
Jarre and then you're able to store them

00:06:41.240 --> 00:06:43.080 
Jarre and then you're able to store them
I<00:06:41.390> like<00:06:41.540> to<00:06:41.630> store<00:06:41.870> mine<00:06:42.050> in<00:06:42.170> the<00:06:42.260> fridge<00:06:42.530> and

00:06:43.080 --> 00:06:43.090 
I like to store mine in the fridge and

00:06:43.090 --> 00:06:45.460 
I like to store mine in the fridge and
they'll<00:06:44.090> keep<00:06:44.300> for<00:06:44.570> actually<00:06:44.840> quite<00:06:45.020> a<00:06:45.140> long

00:06:45.460 --> 00:06:45.470 
they'll keep for actually quite a long

00:06:45.470 --> 00:06:47.920 
they'll keep for actually quite a long
time<00:06:45.800> that<00:06:45.860> way<00:06:46.310> now<00:06:47.000> this<00:06:47.180> is<00:06:47.360> the<00:06:47.450> easiest

00:06:47.920 --> 00:06:47.930 
time that way now this is the easiest

00:06:47.930 --> 00:06:49.840 
time that way now this is the easiest
way<00:06:48.170> that<00:06:48.200> I<00:06:48.470> found<00:06:48.560> to<00:06:48.950> preserve<00:06:49.280> olives

00:06:49.840 --> 00:06:49.850 
way that I found to preserve olives

00:06:49.850 --> 00:06:52.210 
way that I found to preserve olives
basically<00:06:50.690> the<00:06:50.840> salt<00:06:51.110> here<00:06:51.380> you<00:06:51.560> saw<00:06:51.800> it<00:06:51.860> here

00:06:52.210 --> 00:06:52.220 
basically the salt here you saw it here

00:06:52.220 --> 00:06:54.400 
basically the salt here you saw it here
just<00:06:52.430> how<00:06:52.640> easy<00:06:52.940> it<00:06:53.090> is<00:06:53.180> II<00:06:53.330> just<00:06:53.540> salt<00:06:53.810> with

00:06:54.400 --> 00:06:54.410 
just how easy it is II just salt with

00:06:54.410 --> 00:06:56.200 
just how easy it is II just salt with
the<00:06:54.530> olives<00:06:54.890> and<00:06:55.040> leave<00:06:55.280> men<00:06:55.490> shake<00:06:55.880> them<00:06:56.030> up

00:06:56.200 --> 00:06:56.210 
the olives and leave men shake them up

00:06:56.210 --> 00:06:58.960 
the olives and leave men shake them up
and<00:06:56.360> they'll<00:06:57.170> cure<00:06:57.410> themselves<00:06:58.040> no<00:06:58.280> input

00:06:58.960 --> 00:06:58.970 
and they'll cure themselves no input

00:06:58.970 --> 00:07:01.480 
and they'll cure themselves no input
necessary<00:06:59.480> the<00:07:00.080> other<00:07:00.230> way<00:07:00.560> to<00:07:00.620> cure<00:07:01.160> olives

00:07:01.480 --> 00:07:01.490 
necessary the other way to cure olives

00:07:01.490 --> 00:07:03.370 
necessary the other way to cure olives
really<00:07:01.820> easy<00:07:02.030> if<00:07:02.360> you<00:07:02.690> live<00:07:02.960> in<00:07:03.080> a<00:07:03.170> sunny

00:07:03.370 --> 00:07:03.380 
really easy if you live in a sunny

00:07:03.380 --> 00:07:04.630 
really easy if you live in a sunny
climate<00:07:03.770> you<00:07:03.830> can<00:07:03.950> leave<00:07:04.130> them<00:07:04.220> on<00:07:04.250> the<00:07:04.400> tree

00:07:04.630 --> 00:07:04.640 
climate you can leave them on the tree

00:07:04.640 --> 00:07:06.190 
climate you can leave them on the tree
and<00:07:04.790> they'll<00:07:04.880> Sun<00:07:05.180> dry<00:07:05.390> so<00:07:05.600> I<00:07:05.630> know<00:07:05.750> in<00:07:05.960> San

00:07:06.190 --> 00:07:06.200 
and they'll Sun dry so I know in San

00:07:06.200 --> 00:07:08.830 
and they'll Sun dry so I know in San
Diego<00:07:06.650> had<00:07:07.250> some<00:07:07.490> sun-dried<00:07:07.790> olives<00:07:08.390> right<00:07:08.630> on

00:07:08.830 --> 00:07:08.840 
Diego had some sun-dried olives right on

00:07:08.840 --> 00:07:10.360 
Diego had some sun-dried olives right on
the<00:07:08.930> tree<00:07:09.230> and<00:07:09.440> that's<00:07:09.860> actually<00:07:10.130> the<00:07:10.310> best

00:07:10.360 --> 00:07:10.370 
the tree and that's actually the best

00:07:10.370 --> 00:07:12.430 
the tree and that's actually the best
way<00:07:10.760> of<00:07:10.790> all<00:07:11.000> aside<00:07:11.720> from<00:07:11.870> that<00:07:12.020> you<00:07:12.110> can<00:07:12.230> pick

00:07:12.430 --> 00:07:12.440 
way of all aside from that you can pick

00:07:12.440 --> 00:07:13.840 
way of all aside from that you can pick
ripe<00:07:12.680> olives<00:07:12.920> and<00:07:13.190> then<00:07:13.250> put<00:07:13.520> them<00:07:13.610> in<00:07:13.670> your

00:07:13.840 --> 00:07:13.850 
ripe olives and then put them in your

00:07:13.850 --> 00:07:15.940 
ripe olives and then put them in your
dehydrator<00:07:14.140> but<00:07:15.140> when<00:07:15.290> you<00:07:15.380> do<00:07:15.560> that<00:07:15.710> then

00:07:15.940 --> 00:07:15.950 
dehydrator but when you do that then

00:07:15.950 --> 00:07:17.770 
dehydrator but when you do that then
they<00:07:16.070> get<00:07:16.220> really<00:07:16.520> hard<00:07:17.030> so<00:07:17.330> I<00:07:17.390> don't<00:07:17.600> like

00:07:17.770 --> 00:07:17.780 
they get really hard so I don't like

00:07:17.780 --> 00:07:19.330 
they get really hard so I don't like
them<00:07:17.930> too<00:07:18.080> much<00:07:18.200> the<00:07:18.740> problem<00:07:19.100> with<00:07:19.190> this

00:07:19.330 --> 00:07:19.340 
them too much the problem with this

00:07:19.340 --> 00:07:21.070 
them too much the problem with this
method<00:07:19.760> of<00:07:19.850> curing<00:07:20.150> is<00:07:20.390> that<00:07:20.510> it<00:07:20.630> does<00:07:20.840> add

00:07:21.070 --> 00:07:21.080 
method of curing is that it does add

00:07:21.080 --> 00:07:24.040 
method of curing is that it does add
some<00:07:21.560> salt<00:07:21.860> to<00:07:22.070> the<00:07:22.250> olives<00:07:22.900> so<00:07:23.900> what<00:07:24.020> I

00:07:24.040 --> 00:07:24.050 
some salt to the olives so what I

00:07:24.050 --> 00:07:25.780 
some salt to the olives so what I
recommend<00:07:24.260> is<00:07:24.650> before<00:07:25.040> you<00:07:25.160> use<00:07:25.340> a<00:07:25.370> maybe<00:07:25.610> for

00:07:25.780 --> 00:07:25.790 
recommend is before you use a maybe for

00:07:25.790 --> 00:07:27.190 
recommend is before you use a maybe for
24<00:07:26.240> hours<00:07:26.420> before<00:07:26.540> you<00:07:26.840> use<00:07:26.930> them<00:07:27.050> and<00:07:27.140> don't

00:07:27.190 --> 00:07:27.200 
24 hours before you use them and don't

00:07:27.200 --> 00:07:28.900 
24 hours before you use them and don't
don't<00:07:27.740> store<00:07:28.220> them<00:07:28.310> like<00:07:28.430> this<00:07:28.580> because<00:07:28.790> it

00:07:28.900 --> 00:07:28.910 
don't store them like this because it

00:07:28.910 --> 00:07:31.000 
don't store them like this because it
they'll<00:07:29.030> go<00:07:29.180> bad<00:07:29.390> but<00:07:30.020> 24<00:07:30.470> hours<00:07:30.530> before<00:07:30.770> you

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:31.010 
they'll go bad but 24 hours before you

00:07:31.010 --> 00:07:32.440 
they'll go bad but 24 hours before you
use<00:07:31.100> them<00:07:31.220> like<00:07:31.280> soaking<00:07:31.880> in<00:07:32.060> lights<00:07:32.300> and

00:07:32.440 --> 00:07:32.450 
use them like soaking in lights and

00:07:32.450 --> 00:07:34.780 
use them like soaking in lights and
purified<00:07:33.020> water<00:07:33.290> overnight<00:07:33.890> that<00:07:34.460> will<00:07:34.610> get<00:07:34.760> a

00:07:34.780 --> 00:07:34.790 
purified water overnight that will get a

00:07:34.790 --> 00:07:36.370 
purified water overnight that will get a
little<00:07:35.000> bit<00:07:35.180> of<00:07:35.270> the<00:07:35.360> salt<00:07:35.570> flavor<00:07:36.080> off

00:07:36.370 --> 00:07:36.380 
little bit of the salt flavor off

00:07:36.380 --> 00:07:38.170 
little bit of the salt flavor off
because<00:07:36.980> you<00:07:37.220> know<00:07:37.250> we<00:07:37.580> need<00:07:37.790> an<00:07:37.940> adequate

00:07:38.170 --> 00:07:38.180 
because you know we need an adequate

00:07:38.180 --> 00:07:40.210 
because you know we need an adequate
amount<00:07:38.480> of<00:07:38.750> salt<00:07:38.960> but<00:07:39.080> too<00:07:39.320> much<00:07:39.500> salt<00:07:39.800> is<00:07:40.040> not

00:07:40.210 --> 00:07:40.220 
amount of salt but too much salt is not

00:07:40.220 --> 00:07:42.100 
amount of salt but too much salt is not
good<00:07:40.490> for<00:07:40.640> us<00:07:40.700> and<00:07:40.910> in<00:07:41.300> any<00:07:41.450> case<00:07:41.720> when<00:07:41.990> you<00:07:42.080> are

00:07:42.100 --> 00:07:42.110 
good for us and in any case when you are

00:07:42.110 --> 00:07:44.050 
good for us and in any case when you are
