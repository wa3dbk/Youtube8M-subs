the past couple of years that's some
sort<00:00:36.660> of<00:00:36.719> cheese<00:00:36.989> I<00:00:37.020> guess<00:00:37.530> that's<00:00:37.739> the

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:37.800 
sort of cheese I guess that's the

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:40.910 
sort of cheese I guess that's the
brisket<00:00:38.250> underneath<00:00:39.109> cheese<00:00:40.109> is<00:00:40.289> not<00:00:40.620> looking

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920 
brisket underneath cheese is not looking

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:42.259 
brisket underneath cheese is not looking
too<00:00:40.980> healthy<00:00:41.219> look<00:00:41.460> at<00:00:41.579> the<00:00:41.670> edges<00:00:42.089> on<00:00:42.239> that

00:00:42.259 --> 00:00:42.269 
too healthy look at the edges on that

00:00:42.269 --> 00:00:44.419 
too healthy look at the edges on that
well<00:00:43.230> the<00:00:43.350> whole<00:00:43.499> idea<00:00:43.920> here<00:00:44.159> is<00:00:44.280> the

00:00:44.419 --> 00:00:44.429 
well the whole idea here is the

00:00:44.429 --> 00:00:47.360 
well the whole idea here is the
smokehouse<00:00:44.820> brisket<00:00:45.629> was<00:00:45.749> at<00:00:46.019> smoke<00:00:46.800> for<00:00:47.010> 24

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.370 
smokehouse brisket was at smoke for 24

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:51.619 
smokehouse brisket was at smoke for 24
hours<00:00:47.699> yeah<00:00:48.600> 24<00:00:49.050> hours<00:00:49.350> smoking<00:00:49.949> I<00:00:50.129> guess<00:00:50.629> they

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629 
hours yeah 24 hours smoking I guess they

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:53.360 
hours yeah 24 hours smoking I guess they
must<00:00:51.780> have<00:00:51.899> installed<00:00:52.199> smokers<00:00:52.769> or<00:00:52.979> something

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
must have installed smokers or something

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:56.750 
must have installed smokers or something
or<00:00:54.109> probably<00:00:55.109> not<00:00:55.199> because<00:00:55.800> doesn't<00:00:56.519> smell

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
or probably not because doesn't smell

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:59.209 
or probably not because doesn't smell
