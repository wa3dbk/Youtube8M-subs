hey YouTube kayak DIY here right now
we're<00:00:16.560> going<00:00:16.650> to<00:00:16.740> go<00:00:16.920> over<00:00:17.070> how<00:00:17.220> you<00:00:17.250> can<00:00:17.400> build

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:17.760 
we're going to go over how you can build

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:21.380 
we're going to go over how you can build
this<00:00:17.940> kayak<00:00:18.449> cart<00:00:19.250> not<00:00:20.250> all<00:00:20.580> the<00:00:20.850> components

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:21.390 
this kayak cart not all the components

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:24.050 
this kayak cart not all the components
are<00:00:21.510> glued<00:00:21.779> together<00:00:22.189> but<00:00:23.189> we<00:00:23.580> didn't<00:00:23.910> want

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:24.060 
are glued together but we didn't want

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:25.550 
are glued together but we didn't want
all<00:00:24.390> of<00:00:24.420> the<00:00:24.660> components<00:00:25.199> glued<00:00:25.380> together

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:25.560 
all of the components glued together

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:27.620 
all of the components glued together
because<00:00:26.039> this<00:00:26.369> kayak<00:00:26.699> cart<00:00:27.119> is<00:00:27.359> going<00:00:27.570> to

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:27.630 
because this kayak cart is going to

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:30.290 
because this kayak cart is going to
store<00:00:27.990> in<00:00:28.320> the<00:00:28.859> front<00:00:29.160> hatch<00:00:29.400> of<00:00:29.760> our<00:00:29.880> Hobie

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:30.300 
store in the front hatch of our Hobie

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:33.979 
store in the front hatch of our Hobie
pro<00:00:30.510> angler<00:00:30.720> and<00:00:31.850> so<00:00:32.850> we<00:00:33.239> wanted<00:00:33.750> to<00:00:33.840> make<00:00:33.930> it

00:00:33.979 --> 00:00:33.989 
pro angler and so we wanted to make it

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:36.770 
pro angler and so we wanted to make it
so<00:00:34.290> it<00:00:34.410> came<00:00:34.590> apart<00:00:34.920> and<00:00:35.450> that's<00:00:36.450> how<00:00:36.719> we

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:36.780 
so it came apart and that's how we

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:40.959 
so it came apart and that's how we
designed<00:00:37.230> it<00:00:37.640> so<00:00:39.260> some<00:00:40.260> of<00:00:40.290> these<00:00:40.410> dimensions

00:00:40.959 --> 00:00:40.969 
designed it so some of these dimensions

00:00:40.969 --> 00:00:43.970 
designed it so some of these dimensions
may<00:00:41.969> end<00:00:42.210> up<00:00:42.329> changing<00:00:42.809> based<00:00:43.020> on<00:00:43.320> what<00:00:43.739> kind

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980 
may end up changing based on what kind

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:46.400 
may end up changing based on what kind
of<00:00:44.010> kayak<00:00:44.370> you<00:00:44.399> have<00:00:44.760> you<00:00:45.210> may<00:00:45.450> have<00:00:45.660> to<00:00:45.899> change

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410 
of kayak you have you may have to change

of kayak you have you may have to change
up<00:00:46.649> the<00:00:46.860> design<00:00:47.190> a<00:00:47.219> little<00:00:47.610> bit<00:00:47.760> but<00:00:48.719> this<00:00:49.140> is

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:49.200 
up the design a little bit but this is

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:51.410 
up the design a little bit but this is
here<00:00:49.829> just<00:00:50.430> to<00:00:50.579> give<00:00:50.789> you<00:00:50.910> a<00:00:51.000> little<00:00:51.239> bit<00:00:51.329> of

inspiration so you guys can get out
there<00:00:54.090> and<00:00:54.149> build<00:00:54.570> your<00:00:54.780> own<00:00:55.699> start<00:00:56.699> it<00:00:56.820> off

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
there and build your own start it off

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:00.229 
there and build your own start it off
with<00:00:57.289> using<00:00:58.289> a<00:00:58.410> hacksaw<00:00:58.710> and<00:00:59.280> I<00:00:59.820> ended<00:01:00.120> up

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
with using a hacksaw and I ended up

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:05.870 
with using a hacksaw and I ended up
cutting<00:01:00.809> an<00:01:01.170> axle<00:01:02.329> for<00:01:03.329> this<00:01:03.989> cart<00:01:04.350> the<00:01:05.339> axle

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
cutting an axle for this cart the axle

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:07.940 
cutting an axle for this cart the axle
is<00:01:06.060> made<00:01:06.299> out<00:01:06.450> of<00:01:06.479> threaded<00:01:06.990> rod<00:01:07.229> which<00:01:07.650> looks

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950 
is made out of threaded rod which looks

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:11.550 
is made out of threaded rod which looks
like<00:01:08.159> this

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:11.560 

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:18.510 

then<00:01:11.770> I<00:01:12.280> ended<00:01:12.940> up<00:01:13.240> using<00:01:15.990> the<00:01:17.220> cutting<00:01:18.220> shears

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:18.520 
then I ended up using the cutting shears

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:21.450 
then I ended up using the cutting shears
this<00:01:19.119> here<00:01:19.390> is<00:01:19.570> a<00:01:19.600> PVC<00:01:20.070> ratcheting<00:01:21.070> cutting

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:21.460 
this here is a PVC ratcheting cutting

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:25.230 
this here is a PVC ratcheting cutting
shears<00:01:21.759> and<00:01:22.350> I<00:01:23.350> use<00:01:23.619> that<00:01:23.650> cut<00:01:24.250> all<00:01:24.430> the<00:01:24.610> PVC

00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:25.240 
shears and I use that cut all the PVC

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:30.780 
shears and I use that cut all the PVC
for<00:01:25.960> this<00:01:26.140> cart<00:01:26.409> and<00:01:27.780> I<00:01:28.780> glued<00:01:29.470> the<00:01:30.009> fittings

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:30.790 
for this cart and I glued the fittings

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:33.719 
for this cart and I glued the fittings
together<00:01:31.440> with<00:01:32.440> all-purpose<00:01:32.800> cement<00:01:33.490> and

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:36.280 
primer you apply the primer first then

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:40.039 
primer you apply the primer first then

00:01:43.529 --> 00:01:43.539 
pieces I actually fix together and glued

00:01:43.539 --> 00:01:48.900 
pieces I actually fix together and glued
together<00:01:43.690> which<00:01:44.649> ones<00:01:44.890> I<00:01:45.039> didn't<00:01:46.320> so<00:01:47.320> as<00:01:47.910> you

going<00:02:51.340> to<00:02:51.430> glue<00:02:51.609> here<00:02:51.970> does<00:02:52.840> that<00:02:53.049> make<00:02:53.230> sense

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:53.260 
going to glue here does that make sense

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:58.710 
going to glue here does that make sense
I<00:02:53.769> hope<00:02:53.950> it<00:02:54.160> does<00:02:56.070> now<00:02:57.070> we<00:02:57.130> start<00:02:57.700> off<00:02:57.820> and<00:02:58.150> we

00:02:58.710 --> 00:02:58.720 
I hope it does now we start off and we

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:02.849 
I hope it does now we start off and we
have<00:02:58.959> a<00:02:58.989> cap<00:03:00.030> then<00:03:01.030> we<00:03:01.239> have<00:03:01.450> the<00:03:02.019> handle<00:03:02.500> here

00:03:02.849 --> 00:03:02.859 
have a cap then we have the handle here

00:03:02.859 --> 00:03:05.970 
have a cap then we have the handle here
this<00:03:03.549> is<00:03:03.790> what<00:03:04.090> we<00:03:04.209> use<00:03:04.450> to<00:03:04.480> maneuver<00:03:05.290> the<00:03:05.500> cart

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:05.980 
this is what we use to maneuver the cart

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:08.759 
this is what we use to maneuver the cart
underneath<00:03:06.370> the<00:03:06.730> kayak<00:03:07.209> and<00:03:07.450> it<00:03:08.019> also<00:03:08.170> acts<00:03:08.530> as

00:03:08.759 --> 00:03:08.769 
underneath the kayak and it also acts as

00:03:08.769 --> 00:03:13.430 
underneath the kayak and it also acts as
a<00:03:08.829> stand<00:03:09.280> for<00:03:10.239> the<00:03:10.299> cart<00:03:10.870> when<00:03:11.200> the<00:03:11.440> kayak<00:03:11.829> is

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:13.440 
a stand for the cart when the kayak is

a stand for the cart when the kayak is
not<00:03:14.440> underneath<00:03:14.950> it<00:03:15.130> or<00:03:15.850> on<00:03:16.150> it<00:03:17.160> we<00:03:18.160> have<00:03:18.430> 20<00:03:19.330> or
