single one is going to be coming with
the<00:00:30.269> Kinect<00:00:30.599> so<00:00:30.750> they<00:00:30.869> really<00:00:31.199> have<00:00:31.349> to<00:00:31.439> step

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:31.590

infrared it's going to be able to

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:25.550 
infrared it's going to be able to
recognize<00:01:23.610> minor<00:01:24.240> wrist<00:01:24.689> movements<00:01:25.350> as<00:01:25.500> well

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:56.820 
know which player is talking which i

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:58.609 
know which player is talking which i
think<00:01:56.880> is<00:01:57.030> going<00:01:57.210> to<00:01:57.270> be<00:01:57.299> really<00:01:57.540> cool<00:01:57.840> as<00:01:58.079> well

00:01:58.609 --> 00:01:58.619 
think is going to be really cool as well

00:01:58.619 --> 00:01:59.450 
think is going to be really cool as well
as<00:01:58.710> it's<00:01:58.829> going<00:01:58.920> to<00:01:58.979> be<00:01:59.070> able<00:01:59.159> to<00:01:59.310> register

00:01:59.450 --> 00:01:59.460 
as it's going to be able to register

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:01.730 
as it's going to be able to register
which<00:02:00.000> controllers<00:02:00.630> in<00:02:00.840> which<00:02:01.020> players<00:02:01.229> hands

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:01.740 
which controllers in which players hands

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:04.069 
which controllers in which players hands
a<00:02:01.890> bunch<00:02:02.579> of<00:02:02.700> my<00:02:02.850> new<00:02:03.060> things<00:02:03.420> like<00:02:03.509> that<00:02:03.810> that

00:02:04.069 --> 00:02:04.079 
a bunch of my new things like that that

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:05.810 
a bunch of my new things like that that
I<00:02:04.140> think<00:02:04.560> are<00:02:04.680> really<00:02:05.040> going<00:02:05.310> to<00:02:05.399> have<00:02:05.610> this

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:05.820 
I think are really going to have this

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:09.559 
I think are really going to have this
thing<00:02:06.060> being<00:02:06.719> a<00:02:07.310> cool<00:02:08.310> cool<00:02:08.849> addition<00:02:09.390> to<00:02:09.479> the

thing being a cool cool addition to the

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:11.330 
thing being a cool cool addition to the
Xbox<00:02:09.929> one<00:02:10.200> definitely<00:02:10.800> worth<00:02:10.920> it<00:02:11.099> to<00:02:11.190> me<00:02:11.310> I

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:11.340 
Xbox one definitely worth it to me I

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:12.559 
Xbox one definitely worth it to me I
think<00:02:11.550> it's<00:02:11.790> going<00:02:11.849> to<00:02:11.940> be<00:02:12.030> something<00:02:12.330> really

00:02:12.559 --> 00:02:12.569 
think it's going to be something really

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:13.820 
think it's going to be something really
fun<00:02:12.900> to<00:02:13.020> use

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830 
fun to use

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:15.320 
fun to use
know<00:02:13.980> what<00:02:14.070> you<00:02:14.160> guys<00:02:14.280> think<00:02:14.580> though<00:02:14.820> and<00:02:15.090> take

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:15.330 
know what you guys think though and take

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:16.940 
know what you guys think though and take
a<00:02:15.360> look<00:02:15.630> at<00:02:15.750> this<00:02:15.840> video<00:02:16.020> and<00:02:16.380> listen<00:02:16.740> to<00:02:16.830> the

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:16.950 
a look at this video and listen to the

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:19.340 
a look at this video and listen to the
specifics<00:02:17.490> I<00:02:17.700> was<00:02:17.910> really<00:02:18.150> amazed<00:02:18.840> at<00:02:19.110> all<00:02:19.260> the

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:19.350 
specifics I was really amazed at all the

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:22.190 
specifics I was really amazed at all the
detail<00:02:19.740> that<00:02:20.100> went<00:02:20.190> into<00:02:20.310> the<00:02:21.240> device<00:02:21.540> so<00:02:22.050> let

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:22.200 
detail that went into the device so let

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:23.450 
detail that went into the device so let
me<00:02:22.260> know<00:02:22.320> what<00:02:22.440> you<00:02:22.500> think<00:02:22.650> and<00:02:22.920> I'll<00:02:23.190> see<00:02:23.400> you

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:23.460 
me know what you think and I'll see you

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:25.220 
me know what you think and I'll see you
guys<00:02:23.520> next<00:02:23.910> video<00:02:24.120> I'm<00:02:24.480> possible<00:02:25.020> on<00:02:25.170> the

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:25.230 
guys next video I'm possible on the

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:26.800 
guys next video I'm possible on the
previous<00:02:25.530> generation<00:02:25.560> the<00:02:26.280> sensor<00:02:26.640> itself

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:26.810 
previous generation the sensor itself

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:30.200 
previous generation the sensor itself
uses<00:02:27.810> a<00:02:28.140> totally<00:02:28.800> different<00:02:29.130> technology<00:02:29.730> to

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:30.210 
uses a totally different technology to

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:32.720 
uses a totally different technology to
sense<00:02:30.540> depth<00:02:31.020> so<00:02:31.920> it's<00:02:32.070> actually<00:02:32.160> measuring

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:32.730 
sense depth so it's actually measuring

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:35.000 
sense depth so it's actually measuring
the<00:02:32.970> speed<00:02:33.120> it<00:02:33.450> takes<00:02:33.690> photons<00:02:34.350> of<00:02:34.530> light<00:02:34.590> it

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:35.010 
the speed it takes photons of light it

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:37.490 
the speed it takes photons of light it
emits<00:02:35.220> to<00:02:35.640> bounce<00:02:35.880> off<00:02:36.120> your<00:02:36.360> body<00:02:36.600> and<00:02:36.900> hit

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:37.500 
emits to bounce off your body and hit

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:41.690 
emits to bounce off your body and hit
the<00:02:37.620> sensor<00:02:38.900> on<00:02:39.900> that<00:02:40.590> we<00:02:40.860> use<00:02:41.190> I<00:02:41.220> think<00:02:41.580> God

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:41.700 
the sensor on that we use I think God

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:44.270 
the sensor on that we use I think God
active<00:02:42.090> I<00:02:42.210> are<00:02:42.420> as<00:02:43.050> well<00:02:43.290> so<00:02:43.560> this<00:02:43.710> thinkin's

you by scanning you in we're going to

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:33.920 
you by scanning you in we're going to
take<00:03:33.060> you<00:03:33.239> up<00:03:33.269> I<00:03:33.420> guess<00:03:33.570> you<00:03:33.690> could<00:03:33.720> call<00:03:33.870> it

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:33.930 
take you up I guess you could call it

your digital DNA you've got your body

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:37.790 
your digital DNA you've got your body
rig<00:03:36.030> and<00:03:36.239> your<00:03:36.360> face<00:03:36.570> rake<00:03:36.840> so<00:03:37.320> we<00:03:37.470> scan<00:03:37.709> your

00:06:08.929 --> 00:06:08.939 
in this game we build a virtual version

00:06:08.939 --> 00:06:10.640 
in this game we build a virtual version
of<00:06:09.150> you<00:06:09.240> and<00:06:09.389> allow<00:06:09.539> you<00:06:09.569> to<00:06:09.750> stylize<00:06:10.139> it<00:06:10.199> and

00:06:10.640 --> 00:06:10.650 
of you and allow you to stylize it and

00:06:10.650 --> 00:06:11.990 
of you and allow you to stylize it and
then<00:06:10.919> we<00:06:11.009> send<00:06:11.189> that<00:06:11.250> up<00:06:11.430> to<00:06:11.520> the<00:06:11.550> cloud<00:06:11.789> and<00:06:11.909> we

00:06:11.990 --> 00:06:12.000 
then we send that up to the cloud and we

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:13.790 
then we send that up to the cloud and we
make<00:06:12.210> it<00:06:12.330> available<00:06:12.419> to<00:06:12.810> every<00:06:13.289> other<00:06:13.469> player
