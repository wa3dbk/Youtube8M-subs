00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:24.170 
it's just a little more basic this has

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:26.499 
it's just a little more basic this has
ice<00:01:24.439> in<00:01:24.950> Aidan<00:01:25.369> it's<00:01:25.789> not<00:01:25.969> as<00:01:26.119> cool<00:01:26.389> the

00:01:26.499 --> 00:01:26.509 
ice in Aidan it's not as cool the

00:01:26.509 --> 00:01:28.029 
ice in Aidan it's not as cool the
animation<00:01:26.959> but<00:01:27.229> what<00:01:27.380> is<00:01:27.469> cool<00:01:27.740> is<00:01:27.770> you<00:01:27.859> can

00:01:28.029 --> 00:01:28.039 
animation but what is cool is you can

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:31.179 
animation but what is cool is you can
set<00:01:28.219> your<00:01:28.340> own<00:01:28.549> wallpaper<00:01:29.209> to<00:01:29.509> it<00:01:29.630> unlike<00:01:30.380> my

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:36.560 
you'll notice that the water level does

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:38.529 
you'll notice that the water level does
indeed<00:01:36.859> reflect<00:01:37.369> the<00:01:37.670> current<00:01:37.999> battery<00:01:38.359> level

00:01:38.529 --> 00:01:38.539

if you like orcas you'll occasionally
get<00:01:45.859> an<00:01:45.979> orca<00:01:46.399> going<00:01:47.299> across<00:01:47.509> the<00:01:47.779> screen<00:01:47.959> and

00:01:48.279 --> 00:01:48.289 
get an orca going across the screen and

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:50.469 
get an orca going across the screen and
as<00:01:48.770> mentioned<00:01:49.009> if<00:01:49.279> you<00:01:49.310> tilt<00:01:49.639> the<00:01:49.729> device<00:01:49.999> the
