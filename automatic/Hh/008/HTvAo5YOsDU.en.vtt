00:00:13.269 --> 00:00:18.160
 haley that happens chicuelos I'm mercury 

00:00:16.059 --> 00:00:20.820
 play wars so departure narrated with 

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:20.820
 cinematic 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:26.820
 and you already know that I do not like it here 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:29.279
 upload replay if I do not like things 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:32.070
 well so as they come out naturally 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:34.110
 and if I'm going to upload a replay that 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:37.890
 at least something different so here 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:42.080
 are protagonists of curved today 250 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:42.080
 effective vehicles 

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:54.350
 and while body takes position because 

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:56.750
 we are going to defend this alley of the 

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:59.210
 death with everything until the end here not 

00:00:56.750 --> 00:01:01.040
 there are cheap victories, my friend, let's go 

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:04.660
 present to our other protagonist of 

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:04.660
 today that you already know who is 

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:09.659
 black or yellow fluffy 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:17.100
 and we already position ourselves and that is that in this 

00:01:14.039 --> 00:01:19.109
 map is defended from the bridge many 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:20.850
 they make the mistake of crossing the bridge 

00:01:19.109 --> 00:01:23.039
 and defend it from the side of the 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:25.049
 road crossings but it's not a big 

00:01:23.039 --> 00:01:27.490
 advantage leave this side because it 

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:30.189
 defend from here 

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:32.680
 nevertheless never but never missing some 

00:01:30.189 --> 00:01:36.130
 clueless that is going to defend not there 

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:38.439
 alone in front of the others percent me 

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:40.680
 it seems to step on a car in danger 

00:01:38.439 --> 00:01:40.680
 of extinction 

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:55.609
 and the bad guys start coming 

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:57.469
 the bad boy 

00:01:55.609 --> 00:02:00.140
 there are many that the 50 is defended 

00:01:57.469 --> 00:02:02.060
 from the right site they will not have very 

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:05.119
 difficult begin the first 

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:08.530
 exchanges of evolution and by the way 

00:02:05.119 --> 00:02:08.530
 our friend in danger of extinction 

00:02:10.929 --> 00:02:15.790
 when the enemy is at 

00:02:13.299 --> 00:02:18.250
 defenses of the part an area of â€‹â€‹the 

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:19.719
 crossroads and knows what there is but 

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:21.310
 when they have only found one 

00:02:19.719 --> 00:02:23.170
 little scout who have shot down without 

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:25.689
 no problem as they move a little 

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:29.500
 confident and have met with a 

00:02:25.689 --> 00:02:31.960
 solid defense in the bridge area 

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:34.500
 we finally start to shoot we enter 

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:34.500
 in action 

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:40.450
 and little by little we are going to beat one by one 

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:40.450
 to all of them 

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:46.410
 you also have to take it easy is 

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:48.750
 a hurry 

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:51.990
 we have to advance us only 

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:54.430
 we had to descend 

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:56.409
 once we have 

00:02:54.430 --> 00:03:02.010
 in the bridge area and then 

00:02:56.409 --> 00:03:02.010
 we can move forward and take our point 

00:03:15.319 --> 00:03:22.129
 after an intense skirmish here 

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:23.540
 formed is charged its first low and in the 

00:03:22.129 --> 00:03:25.700
 step is clean 

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:28.430
 now we have to advance them by opening 

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:29.870
 step between defense junk 

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:31.989
 that may remain in the lines of 

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:31.989
 activity 

00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:45.310
 and as dictates any good book of 

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:47.530
 military academy we know that we have the 

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:50.380
 Alley of death insured 

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:53.110
 we started to move forward but very little to 

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:55.210
 little in correct training we know that 

00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:58.590
 It's never too late to meet with 

00:03:55.210 --> 00:03:58.590
 remains of enemy lines 

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:12.980
 and effectively we find a 

00:04:10.710 --> 00:04:15.709
 welcome surprise 

00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:18.079
 so very strong impact I return the 

00:04:15.709 --> 00:04:22.329
 fire but it's like we finish and here 

00:04:18.079 --> 00:04:22.329
 he takes his second casualty of the battle 

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:30.240
 we continue with our pride advance 

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:32.009
 together we seek the protection of the flank 

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:32.889
 right and its walls to protect us from 

00:04:32.009 --> 00:04:35.889
 Snow 

00:04:32.889 --> 00:04:39.659
 then we can see in the distance a lime gel 

00:04:35.889 --> 00:04:39.659
 a dreaded on the road 

00:04:41.289 --> 00:04:46.839
 it has been a difficult shot a trajectory 

00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:48.999
 complicated a lot distance and I could only 

00:04:46.839 --> 00:04:51.399
 have a part of the little hellcat that 

00:04:48.999 --> 00:04:54.369
 it was in motion however 

00:04:51.399 --> 00:04:56.680
 it was imperative to destroy it there was no 

00:04:54.369 --> 00:04:59.860
 time to aim could not allow that 

00:04:56.680 --> 00:05:03.669
 he escaped is the one who was painting 

00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:07.319
 all our allies had to fall and 

00:05:03.669 --> 00:05:07.319
 I had to make him travel 

00:05:17.139 --> 00:05:20.919
 with is of the first low to speak 

00:05:18.999 --> 00:05:23.469
 with we continue advancing and we continue with 

00:05:20.919 --> 00:05:25.300
 caution we continue to follow the 

00:05:23.469 --> 00:05:27.789
 walls of the right flank because there 

00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:31.710
 artillery and it's our only protection 

00:05:27.789 --> 00:05:33.510
 from a clean shot 4 at us 

00:05:31.710 --> 00:05:35.550
 there are not many enemies left and they were 

00:05:33.510 --> 00:05:37.290
 hidden and then we could the last 

00:05:35.550 --> 00:05:39.710
 defense strongholds only when we 

00:05:37.290 --> 00:05:39.710
 shoot 

00:05:54.090 --> 00:05:58.560
 well the situation is complicated there are two 

00:05:56.940 --> 00:06:00.990
 entrenched enemies 

00:05:58.560 --> 00:06:03.180
 I am mobilized and then I go 

00:06:00.990 --> 00:06:04.960
 discover a third enemy that tries 

00:06:03.180 --> 00:06:08.130
 consider however 

00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:08.130
 and he manages to beat it 

00:06:11.220 --> 00:06:15.120
 and it is and corvo sum to its third low 

00:06:13.440 --> 00:06:17.340
 we only have three enemies left 

00:06:15.120 --> 00:06:19.080
 artillery and two stays but those two 

00:06:17.340 --> 00:06:21.210
 tanks we have them in front of you are very 

00:06:19.080 --> 00:06:23.790
 well covered very well entrenched 

00:06:21.210 --> 00:06:27.860
 however he managed to find the point 

00:06:23.790 --> 00:06:27.860
 to perform a clean shot 

00:06:42.280 --> 00:06:48.460
 and that's how black or I adds two losses 

00:06:45.790 --> 00:06:50.590
 more for a total of 13 I receive fire from 

00:06:48.460 --> 00:06:53.020
 the artillery but it does not matter it does not achieve 

00:06:50.590 --> 00:06:55.180
 destroy me however lining put me 

00:06:53.020 --> 00:06:57.580
 covered because if it serves to remind me 

00:06:55.180 --> 00:06:59.800
 that although we have to go for that 

00:06:57.580 --> 00:07:02.020
 artillery that remains as the last redoubt 

00:06:59.800 --> 00:07:03.970
 of enemy resistance 

00:07:02.020 --> 00:07:06.250
 we have to do it carefully because 

00:07:03.970 --> 00:07:08.470
 with three casualties each we have won a 

00:07:06.250 --> 00:07:10.660
 precious brothers of arms and not us 

00:07:08.470 --> 00:07:11.110
 we can allow any of the 

00:07:10.660 --> 00:07:13.120
 two 

00:07:11.110 --> 00:07:15.310
 unfortunately that artillery does not 

00:07:13.120 --> 00:07:17.500
 we are able to find us is despondent 

00:07:15.310 --> 00:07:19.900
 by one of our colleagues still 

00:07:17.500 --> 00:07:22.419
 It has been a very good battle very 

00:07:19.900 --> 00:07:25.240
 intense and very funny if you liked 

00:07:22.419 --> 00:07:26.980
 a like it helps me a lot if you want 

00:07:25.240 --> 00:07:29.380
 that a friend can see it you can share 

00:07:26.980 --> 00:07:31.360
 and if you are not subscribed then you can 

00:07:29.380 --> 00:07:33.250
 subscribe for more come to ported very 

00:07:31.360 --> 00:07:35.880
 bad that carrying is boring and even a 

00:07:33.250 --> 00:07:35.880
 next video 

00:07:36.520 --> 00:07:39.879
 at the time of video game 

00:07:38.050 --> 00:07:41.880
 it's not always free culture we're 

00:07:39.879 --> 00:07:44.720
 giving away together 

00:07:41.880 --> 00:07:44.720
 culture culture 

00:07:47.030 --> 00:07:50.030
 I say
