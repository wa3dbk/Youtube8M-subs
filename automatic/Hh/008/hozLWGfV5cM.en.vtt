00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:05.849
 new tutorial on this channel we're going to 

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:07.889
 talk about how to make a door 

00:00:05.849 --> 00:00:10.080
 fortress with garlic pistons for 

00:00:07.889 --> 00:00:13.740
 minecraft the first thing to do 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:17.519
 is to do a depth in the well of 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:19.679
 four in length and one video one cube 

00:00:17.519 --> 00:00:23.120
 of depth 

00:00:19.679 --> 00:00:26.660
 the next thing is to fill in this 

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:29.090
 with four sticky piston peaks 

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:32.599
 so you have to be walking to 

00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:34.950
 Up next it is the brick 

00:00:32.599 --> 00:00:39.870
 stone make 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:43.649
 1 2 3 4 5 to follow 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:46.949
 1 2 3 4 5 that with this what we are going to 

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:53.210
 get like this 52 and with this what we're going to 

00:00:46.949 --> 00:00:56.840
 get going to be a very quality tower 

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:59.070
 very pretty can be said as it is 

00:00:56.840 --> 00:01:02.520
 very good 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:03.690
 of huelva the medieval era and if you want 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:06.120
 make a way that was left very 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:09.300
 good is good the next thing to do 

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:11.630
 is to make four of height without counting the 

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:11.630
 base 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:17.250
 4 

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:17.250
 to the corners 4 

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:22.110
 4 

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:22.110
 to all corners 

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:28.640
 stone brick is one of the very 

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:31.940
 elegant 

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:35.250
 and you get the stone from the side 

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:38.190
 well encouraged in the oven 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:42.290
 now in the middle in the middle of each 

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:42.290
 place also with 4 

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:51.240
 3. 4 

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:51.240
 well and this we 're going 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:55.490
 was the following should do 

00:01:56.230 --> 00:02:06.930
 the following is this in these gaps 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:06.930
 make 3 1 2 3 

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:15.430
 3 like this and it's going to get a 

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:18.030
 tower 

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:18.030
 3 

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:21.910
 birds 

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:32.960
 3 on the stone strip you get from 

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:36.460
 put 4 stone in the crafting 

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:39.520
 as well as making a decision block 

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:41.270
 efe to finish and as you realize 

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:44.540
 it looks very good 

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:47.870
 yes must be built or is 

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:51.650
 be stuck to the inside of your 

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:53.900
 strength or if it's not going to stay it's not going to 

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:57.549
 have not been 

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:57.549
 a huge house we do the same 

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:13.180
 and name the takes the base if 

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:17.650
 they want they can do the problem too 

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:17.650
 he does 

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:29.500
 this is what you get is something very 

00:03:24.739 --> 00:03:29.500
 very good and also avoid yourselves 

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:36.330
 invites in a very good way we 

00:03:33.210 --> 00:03:39.260
 then arriving more the only thing that can 

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:39.260
 happen 

00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:44.700
 but let's go on a meal 

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:48.830
 good 

00:03:53.710 --> 00:04:01.220
 and the sticky pythons are obtained 

00:03:57.340 --> 00:04:04.370
 and attach the slide gems 

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:08.050
 and a normal view in which you get 

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:08.050
 of a slide 

00:04:08.210 --> 00:04:11.500
 good this 

00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:22.109
 and bad taste 

00:04:19.390 --> 00:04:24.770
 and now we go to the form 

00:04:22.109 --> 00:04:24.770
 yes 

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:33.540
 we have to make one 

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:37.790
 234 and stamping and this we are going to do it 

00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:41.990
 this part will be at this level will not be 

00:04:37.790 --> 00:04:41.990
 covered but this 

00:04:42.139 --> 00:04:47.120
 and it's only going to be covered in these two 

00:04:44.419 --> 00:04:48.889
 parts this does not have to also for 

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:51.249
 that when for example we talked about 

00:04:48.889 --> 00:04:51.249
 door 

00:04:51.790 --> 00:04:55.960
 we can jump 

00:04:54.030 --> 00:04:58.770
 without any problem 

00:04:55.960 --> 00:04:58.770
 then take out 

00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:04.870
 we make 4 also those of sensual 

00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:07.990
 now if you're going to take out 

00:05:04.870 --> 00:05:11.610
 and if you want to give something more decorative 

00:05:07.990 --> 00:05:14.910
 can put a brick can be used 

00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:14.910
 stone slabs 

00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:21.230
 does anyone speak very well this depends 

00:05:17.750 --> 00:05:23.860
 of the degree of heart you want to use 

00:05:21.230 --> 00:05:23.860
 anyway 

00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:27.860
 Now what you have to do is place 

00:05:25.970 --> 00:05:33.280
 redstone here 

00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:33.280
 and here and on the other side the same 

00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:38.719
 Now we can like that and rapporteur is a 

00:05:37.069 --> 00:05:40.759
 lever the side inside the path and 

00:05:38.719 --> 00:05:44.180
 ends lever on this side instead 

00:05:40.759 --> 00:05:48.380
 from the outside of donation genes 

00:05:44.180 --> 00:05:51.350
 will need to move the rest 

00:05:48.380 --> 00:05:55.810
 also decorated they have to put it on 

00:05:51.350 --> 00:05:59.620
 this way so imagine 

00:05:55.810 --> 00:06:01.830
 and then and it's like that and that's how it's closed 

00:05:59.620 --> 00:06:01.830
 the door 

00:06:02.289 --> 00:06:07.319
 when I left these but it was to be able 

00:06:04.839 --> 00:06:07.319
 happen 

00:06:11.969 --> 00:06:19.960
 last step what we have to do 

00:06:17.439 --> 00:06:23.619
 It is only here upstairs so that it is 

00:06:19.960 --> 00:06:28.210
 more managed to put in the part where not 

00:06:23.619 --> 00:06:30.870
 we put stones for 12 and there is that way 

00:06:28.210 --> 00:06:33.690
 more castle 

00:06:30.870 --> 00:06:36.060
 when they arrive running if any engine 

00:06:33.690 --> 00:06:37.390
 chase or if you want to open the windows 

00:06:36.060 --> 00:06:39.040
 and that 

00:06:37.390 --> 00:06:41.000
 and so it is 

00:06:39.040 --> 00:06:43.930
 and there is a door 

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:46.830
 now yes thank you very much 

00:06:43.930 --> 00:06:46.830
 and this lion
