00:00:06.670 --> 00:00:11.290
 everything depends on what you dare to 

00:00:08.650 --> 00:00:13.750
 believe as life your same body is the 

00:00:11.290 --> 00:00:15.190
 result of your perception medicine 

00:00:13.750 --> 00:00:17.430
 check that the body is a powerful 

00:00:15.190 --> 00:00:20.330
 pharmacy 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:22.140
 which can create any drug or 

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:23.800
 stupefying that the laboratories 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:27.220
 have 

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:29.650
 with better quality the correct dose for 

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:34.780
 the precise organ without side effect 

00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:36.670
 and even cheaper there are simple processes 

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:40.059
 in our organism happening all the 

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:44.650
 time these simple processes are eating 

00:00:40.059 --> 00:00:48.190
 breathe digest metabolism elimination 

00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:50.450
 and something that controls all these the 

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:52.250
 awareness 

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:55.820
 thinking at a fundamental level 

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:57.860
 non-verbal without linguistic structure more 

00:00:55.820 --> 00:01:00.740
 well from a communication network 

00:00:57.860 --> 00:01:04.309
 cellular is controlling all these 

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:05.480
 processes if you can connect with these 

00:01:04.309 --> 00:01:09.170
 processes 

00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:11.900
 then remove 95% of all 

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:14.600
 diseases you can still reverse the 

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:17.600
 most diseases if you come in 

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:20.300
 contact with these vital processes and 

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:23.320
 that the body is an impression of 

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:23.320
 our way of thinking 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:28.469
 the big problem that plagues the 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:30.570
 humanity is that you have immersed yourself in this 

00:01:28.469 --> 00:01:34.409
 superstition of materialism the 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:37.500
 materialism says that the world is 

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:39.810
 made of physical objects and if it exists 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:41.789
 something like the thought are about the 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:44.729
 phenomenon of matter in other words 

00:01:41.789 --> 00:01:47.670
 that thought is the result of 

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:49.679
 biochemical products in my body that 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:51.509
 these biochemical reactions of some 

00:01:49.679 --> 00:01:54.450
 way they create awareness or 

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:56.520
 thought that we are physical machines 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:58.970
 creating the thought when in 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:01.709
 reality is the opposite to this we are 

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:05.009
 thoughts constantly creating 

00:02:01.709 --> 00:02:07.590
 our reality proverb 23 7 says 

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:11.069
 because what is your thinking in your 

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:13.829
 heart look like we created the 

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:16.560
 mind we are not the mind we create 

00:02:13.829 --> 00:02:17.010
 the body and through the body and the 

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:19.650
 mind 

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:21.060
 we ultimately created the experiences 

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:23.190
 of our world 

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:26.670
 the world in its fundamental basis is so 

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:29.430
 just a soup of atoms of energy and of 

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:33.000
 that energy through faith we can 

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:35.190
 create what we need to wake up 

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:37.739
 our conscience and move to this faith 

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:40.739
 first we have to disassociate ourselves 

00:02:37.739 --> 00:02:44.000
 of our senses because because of 

00:02:40.739 --> 00:02:46.769
 sensory experience we have created the 

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:50.790
 superstition that everything we can 

00:02:46.769 --> 00:02:53.910
 seeing smell listening or touching is the only 

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:56.190
 how things are but that's 

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:58.650
 wrong my eyes tells me that the 

00:02:56.190 --> 00:03:00.930
 land is flat but the reality is that 

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:02.519
 no one believes that and senses say it 

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:05.489
 that the ground where we are standing is 

00:03:02.519 --> 00:03:08.790
 stationary and the reality is that it's 

00:03:05.489 --> 00:03:11.310
 spinning at dizzying speeds that 

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:13.799
 the night sky light are 

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:15.599
 stars that are still there when 

00:03:13.799 --> 00:03:18.840
 could have disappeared thousands of 

00:03:15.599 --> 00:03:22.140
 years ago so forget the 

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:25.620
 superstition of materialism and begins 

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:27.690
 to see things as they really are if you 

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:30.239
 you will ask a physicist who is the body 

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:33.060
 I would tell you that the body is a field 

00:03:30.239 --> 00:03:35.519
 dynamic energy information 

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:37.560
 intelligence that constantly 

00:03:35.519 --> 00:03:40.560
 renews himself in every moment of his 

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:44.850
 existence that in fact you create a 

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:49.380
 new body every year 98% of the atoms 

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:52.139
 your body come and go every year you 

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:55.380
 you create a new skin every month a new 

00:03:52.139 --> 00:03:59.440
 skeleton every three months a new 

00:03:55.380 --> 00:04:01.600
 stomach lining every five 

00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:04.000
 even the brain cells with which 

00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:06.910
 you think they are made of carbon 

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:10.510
 hydrogen nitrogen and oxygen were not 

00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:12.700
 there a year ago and the DNA the material 

00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:15.520
 genetic that is made up of so much 

00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:19.030
 information comes and goes like birds 

00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:21.220
 migratory every six weeks when a 

00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:23.230
 through x-rays - you compare the same 

00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:26.020
 cancerous tumor six months ago 

00:04:23.230 --> 00:04:29.860
 you are truly looking at the same 

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:32.830
 tumor on the material level not every atom 

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:35.920
 of oxygen carbon that forms this 

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:38.170
 tumor are not the same are different to 

00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:41.350
 those of the tumor six months ago without 

00:04:38.170 --> 00:04:44.650
 However, the cellular memory is the same 

00:04:41.350 --> 00:04:47.740
 physiological processes at a level not 

00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:51.070
 material are the same that's why it follows 

00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:54.910
 appearing in the same way 

00:04:51.070 --> 00:04:57.850
 it's like the structure of a building if 

00:04:54.910 --> 00:05:00.220
 I had the ability to change these 

00:04:57.850 --> 00:05:03.040
 bricks 

00:05:00.220 --> 00:05:04.930
 six months but I'm stuck in the 

00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:07.470
 notion that this is the only way to 

00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:07.470
 do what 

00:05:10.849 --> 00:05:16.490
 although the bricks are different 

00:05:13.309 --> 00:05:19.099
 result will be the same structure all 

00:05:16.490 --> 00:05:21.229
 the time if I want to get rid of this 

00:05:19.099 --> 00:05:24.259
 tumor I have to do it from your base 

00:05:21.229 --> 00:05:26.839
 fundamental this is the impulses of 

00:05:24.259 --> 00:05:29.179
 energy and information transforming 

00:05:26.839 --> 00:05:33.189
 all the things that structure the 

00:05:29.179 --> 00:05:33.189
 non-physical aspects of the tumor 

00:05:36.310 --> 00:05:40.810
 it has been estimated that humans 

00:05:37.870 --> 00:05:43.360
 they have about 60 thousand thoughts 

00:05:40.810 --> 00:05:46.780
 the most surprising thing is that for 

00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:48.940
 most people 96% of 

00:05:46.780 --> 00:05:51.460
 thoughts that you have today are the 

00:05:48.940 --> 00:05:53.530
 same as they had yesterday so we 

00:05:51.460 --> 00:05:55.470
 we turn into a bunch of answers 

00:05:53.530 --> 00:05:58.690
 conditioned by reflections 

00:05:55.470 --> 00:06:01.170
 constantly activated by people and 

00:05:58.690 --> 00:06:04.240
 circumstances become 

00:06:01.170 --> 00:06:07.750
 predictable behaviors that produce 

00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:10.870
 biochemical products reflected in 

00:06:07.750 --> 00:06:14.980
 our health but do not want you 

00:06:10.870 --> 00:06:17.740
 you are the result of your expectations you 

00:06:14.980 --> 00:06:21.259
 physical body is an interpretation of 

00:06:17.740 --> 00:06:23.520
 what is happening inside you 

00:06:21.259 --> 00:06:26.849
 confirmed that I had healed cancer 

00:06:23.520 --> 00:06:31.530
 to the liver or in the liver and that you felt 

00:06:26.849 --> 00:06:34.020
 what happened and today I was able to eat empanadas 

00:06:31.530 --> 00:06:36.530
 I have eaten for seven months since 

00:06:34.020 --> 00:06:36.530
 I ate nothing 

00:06:40.030 --> 00:06:46.530
 if I got on the roller coaster and my 

00:06:43.480 --> 00:06:49.120
 interpretation is that it is an experience 

00:06:46.530 --> 00:06:51.790
 fun my body naturally 

00:06:49.120 --> 00:06:54.280
 will begin to produce interleukin and 

00:06:51.790 --> 00:06:57.700
 interferon these are powerful 

00:06:54.280 --> 00:06:59.140
 treatments with that against cancer if 

00:06:57.700 --> 00:07:02.050
 I had to buy this treatment 

00:06:59.140 --> 00:07:04.780
 to treat cancer or melanoma 

00:07:02.050 --> 00:07:07.750
 kidney I would leave about 40 thousand dollars 

00:07:04.780 --> 00:07:11.290
 for treatment when yes my experience 

00:07:07.750 --> 00:07:13.150
 on the roller coaster is fun or what 

00:07:11.290 --> 00:07:16.240
 deeper in my being I think it's from 

00:07:13.150 --> 00:07:18.010
 fun just my body 

00:07:16.240 --> 00:07:20.470
 could naturally create what 

00:07:18.010 --> 00:07:22.550
 would amount to a million dollars in 

00:07:20.470 --> 00:07:26.540
 interleukin 

00:07:22.550 --> 00:07:29.420
 now well if you take the same ride but 

00:07:26.540 --> 00:07:31.670
 your experience is that of terror then 

00:07:29.420 --> 00:07:34.190
 your body can naturally produce 

00:07:31.670 --> 00:07:36.770
 cortisol and adrenaline and a lot of 

00:07:34.190 --> 00:07:39.410
 other things that will destroy your system 

00:07:36.770 --> 00:07:42.170
 immune then the difference 

00:07:39.410 --> 00:07:45.280
 between destroying your immune system or 

00:07:42.170 --> 00:07:47.720
 stimulate your immune system 

00:07:45.280 --> 00:07:49.490
 crucial differences that can 

00:07:47.720 --> 00:07:52.400
 defend life or death is 

00:07:49.490 --> 00:07:55.240
 find in the interpretation of a 

00:07:52.400 --> 00:07:55.240
 experience
