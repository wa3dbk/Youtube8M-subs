00:02:05.929 --> 00:02:05.939 
behind it while this here serves proof

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:08.210 
behind it while this here serves proof
that<00:02:06.390> this<00:02:06.810> is<00:02:07.110> going<00:02:07.439> to<00:02:07.530> be<00:02:07.619> the<00:02:07.770> last<00:02:07.950> game

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:08.220 
that this is going to be the last game

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:09.040 
that this is going to be the last game
