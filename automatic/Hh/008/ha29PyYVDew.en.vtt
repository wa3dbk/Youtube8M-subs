discipline this is all shadow that's
what<00:01:03.139> I<00:01:03.170> told<00:01:03.260> students<00:01:04.129> to<00:01:04.220> do<00:01:04.339> that's<00:01:04.759> it

00:01:04.990 --> 00:01:05.000 
what I told students to do that's it

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.060 
what I told students to do that's it
figure<00:01:05.780> out<00:01:05.899> where<00:01:06.079> they<00:01:06.200> where<00:01:06.590> it<00:01:06.680> is<00:01:06.799> and

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:07.070 
figure out where they where it is and

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:09.340 
figure out where they where it is and
fill<00:01:07.369> it<00:01:07.520> in<00:01:07.579> evenly<00:01:08.090> and<00:01:08.750> take<00:01:08.960> out<00:01:09.079> all<00:01:09.110> the

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:09.350 
fill it in evenly and take out all the

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:10.990 
fill it in evenly and take out all the
noise<00:01:09.469> use<00:01:09.799> this<00:01:09.950> bristle<00:01:10.280> brush<00:01:10.490> just<00:01:10.820> to

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:11.000 
noise use this bristle brush just to

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:16.539 
noise use this bristle brush just to
even<00:01:11.479> out<00:01:12.610> blend<00:01:13.610> out<00:01:13.820> that<00:01:14.979> shadow<00:01:15.979> just<00:01:16.430> like

00:01:16.539 --> 00:01:16.549 
even out blend out that shadow just like

00:01:16.549 --> 00:01:19.179 
even out blend out that shadow just like
I'm<00:01:16.729> put<00:01:17.270> in<00:01:17.390> a<00:01:17.450> painting<00:01:17.869> even<00:01:18.140> all<00:01:18.649> that<00:01:18.979> out

00:01:19.179 --> 00:01:19.189 
I'm put in a painting even all that out

00:01:19.189 --> 00:01:21.999 
I'm put in a painting even all that out
and<00:01:19.630> I<00:01:20.630> applied<00:01:20.930> enough<00:01:21.229> pressure<00:01:21.500> that<00:01:21.799> I

00:01:21.999 --> 00:01:22.009 
and I applied enough pressure that I

00:01:22.009 --> 00:01:23.770 
and I applied enough pressure that I
still<00:01:22.340> have<00:01:22.490> a<00:01:22.520> ghost<00:01:22.789> of<00:01:23.000> a<00:01:23.119> form<00:01:23.509> there

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:23.780 
still have a ghost of a form there

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:26.620 
still have a ghost of a form there
that's<00:01:24.409> the<00:01:24.590> origin<00:01:24.890> and<00:01:25.250> it<00:01:25.850> contracts<00:01:26.299> and

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:26.630 
that's the origin and it contracts and

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:29.740 
that's the origin and it contracts and
brings<00:01:27.439> the<00:01:27.590> arm<00:01:27.740> up<00:01:28.070> and<00:01:29.030> both<00:01:29.390> of<00:01:29.420> these

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:29.750 
brings the arm up and both of these

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:31.749 
brings the arm up and both of these
muscles<00:01:30.200> contract<00:01:30.229> together<00:01:30.979> to<00:01:31.250> forcefully

00:01:31.749 --> 00:01:31.759 
muscles contract together to forcefully

00:01:31.759 --> 00:01:34.270 
muscles contract together to forcefully
bring<00:01:32.210> the<00:01:32.329> arm<00:01:32.509> up<00:01:32.659> and<00:01:32.869> this<00:01:33.649> is<00:01:33.859> the

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:34.280 
bring the arm up and this is the

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:36.669 
bring the arm up and this is the
pronator<00:01:35.060> terry's<00:01:35.600> or<00:01:35.780> the<00:01:35.929> rounded<00:01:36.320> muscle

00:01:36.669 --> 00:01:36.679 
pronator terry's or the rounded muscle

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:39.219 
pronator terry's or the rounded muscle
that<00:01:37.210> pronates<00:01:38.210> the<00:01:38.390> end<00:01:38.600> and<00:01:38.869> it<00:01:38.960> goes<00:01:39.079> from

00:01:39.219 --> 00:01:39.229 
that pronates the end and it goes from

00:01:39.229 --> 00:01:41.830 
that pronates the end and it goes from
here<00:01:39.320> to<00:01:39.469> there<00:01:39.799> to<00:01:39.950> the<00:01:40.189> radius<00:01:40.520> and<00:01:40.670> then<00:01:41.630> the

next muscle is the long brachioradialis
I<00:01:50.140> can<00:01:51.140> see<00:01:51.320> this<00:01:51.530> structure<00:01:52.039> of<00:01:52.369> the<00:01:52.460> drawing

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:52.700 
I can see this structure of the drawing

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:54.130 
I can see this structure of the drawing
very<00:01:52.999> clearly<00:01:53.299> here<00:01:53.719> too

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:54.140 
very clearly here too

fingers<00:02:14.480> that<00:02:14.720> they<00:02:14.870> don't<00:02:15.230> end<00:02:15.500> the<00:02:16.310> same

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:17.080 
fingers that they don't end the same

fingers that they don't end the same
same<00:02:18.080> axes<00:02:18.770> and<00:02:18.950> even<00:02:19.160> if<00:02:19.250> when<00:02:19.400> they<00:02:19.520> do<00:02:19.580> I

same axes and even if when they do I

00:02:19.819 --> 00:02:22.630 
same axes and even if when they do I
tend<00:02:20.300> to<00:02:20.500> change<00:02:21.500> it<00:02:21.709> because<00:02:22.069> it<00:02:22.370> does<00:02:22.520> it

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:22.640 
tend to change it because it does it

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:27.100 
tend to change it because it does it
rarely<00:02:23.420> looks<00:02:23.810> real<00:02:24.110> but<00:02:25.600> the<00:02:26.600> body<00:02:26.840> of<00:02:27.020> the

very happy that I've introduced him to
this<00:02:50.930> interesting<00:02:51.590> new<00:02:51.650> muscle<00:02:52.510> okay<00:02:53.510> so<00:02:53.570> here

00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:54.080 
this interesting new muscle okay so here

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:59.590 
this interesting new muscle okay so here
is<00:02:54.200> the<00:02:54.400> pad<00:02:56.620> it's<00:02:57.620> got<00:02:57.769> all<00:02:58.010> kinds<00:02:58.040> of<00:02:58.760> folds

00:02:59.590 --> 00:02:59.600 
is the pad it's got all kinds of folds

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:03.479 
is the pad it's got all kinds of folds
right<00:02:59.870> here<00:03:00.819> because<00:03:01.819> this<00:03:02.000> side<00:03:02.290> is

00:03:03.479 --> 00:03:03.489 
right here because this side is

compressing the other side's extending

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:10.449 
compressing the other side's extending
there's<00:03:09.080> a<00:03:09.230> good<00:03:09.410> strong<00:03:09.709> fold<00:03:10.130> right<00:03:10.430> here

00:03:10.449 --> 00:03:10.459 
there's a good strong fold right here
