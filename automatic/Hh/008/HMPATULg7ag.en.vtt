00:00:07.820 --> 00:00:13.200
 nice all guys i'm more pieces 

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:15.869
 bertrand on my channel guys today 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:19.050
 we are here with a rather short video 

00:00:15.869 --> 00:00:21.660
 I assume, however, that it has an importance 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:24.210
 fundamental for me but super often 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:28.289
 also for you in quotes then 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:30.509
 look at where we are with gearhart 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:32.790
 I made two attacks I miss the last one 

00:00:30.509 --> 00:00:35.010
 attack and look at how much life the has 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:39.300
 headquarters for boys then for the 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:40.500
 first time we will see together in mine 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:43.320
 video my mind in those of others 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:44.760
 proceeds, however, you have already seen in mine 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:46.770
 video you will see for the first time the 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:49.140
 colonel gere art that will have to 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:52.020
 abandon his position his 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:53.370
 its strong point its its must 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:55.650
 abandon his ever have to do a little 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:57.330
 I know some tricks here 

00:00:55.650 --> 00:00:58.920
 that if anything will take the subway to 

00:00:57.330 --> 00:01:00.650
 take a ride somewhere but we'll see you 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:02.640
 don't worry about it next week 

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:04.619
 with your war factory that 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:07.140
 presents will be more difficult however boys 

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:08.520
 really with the warriors on the 16th with the 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:10.170

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:12.030
 I'm having troops sit down 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:13.740
 but I wanted to do it with you because 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:16.200
 I want to show it in these things then 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:19.440
 we leave and immediately attack together 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:21.930
 I break his face down then 

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:24.930
 tested the same technique as the one mentioned 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:29.670

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:32.940

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:39.290
