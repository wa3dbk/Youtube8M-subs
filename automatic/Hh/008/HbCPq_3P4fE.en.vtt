00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.040
 and all good with you android android 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:13.830
 today wanted to talk about the new part 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:14.940
 games as I can call wrong 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:17.490
 with quiet lexx 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:20.400
 he is episode 3 for the first second part i 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:21.960
 did the reviews already let's get started 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:23.730
 First, see what the 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:25.470
 presents but she will introduce herself from 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:28.859
 three-dimensional adventure with very beautiful 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:31.650
 graphics in which you will try 

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:33.420
 solve various puzzles we have 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:35.309
 joysticks but they are not visible in principle 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:36.930
 that is, we can drive on the left and 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:38.790
 on the right we can not like this 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:39.899
 consider how graphics are very 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:42.480
 so nice 

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:44.430
 collect goes to explain that a bear 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:46.440
 they can then be used in the game itself 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:49.170
 and go out of this club planetary 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:51.960
 here it is an incomprehensible area and you can 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:55.469
 evaluate how cool everything is done here 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:58.590
 these are the plants before the building is all beautiful 

00:00:55.469 --> 00:01:00.989
 the texture is also implemented too 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:02.550
 I like this first part two 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:05.489
 part was just like this 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:08.280
 part well how much better 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:09.600
 I became very difficult to define here 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:12.750
 various there are such additional 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:15.600
 things that we fit we allow a 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:17.700
 reset and for such and such si and saunas 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:20.220
 That is, I activate something already and 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:22.890
 so we move around 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:25.020
 level and how are we trying to find a way out 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:28.590
 there are also other places on now i'm 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:30.750
 I'll show you very extensive locations by 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:32.909
 which we are moving here 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:36.900
 let's say that thing you can 

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:39.780
 interactions to mine shown with 

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:42.840
 what exactly is this 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:45.090
 Here now come and so you we can with 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:47.670
 it does not interact 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:50.850
 For some reason, do not write in 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:53.509
 comments that i'm doing wrong here 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:53.509
 there is such a place 

00:01:53.630 --> 00:02:00.020
 here infantry you see nothing i 

00:01:56.180 --> 00:02:03.259
 confused shorter I reached the terrain 

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:06.020
 in the forest, I completely changed the situation 

00:02:03.259 --> 00:02:09.229
 beautifully beautifully done here often 

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:12.650
 the developers released exactly the games here 

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:14.390
 such very cool graphics if given 

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:16.190
 the developer was able to do with such 

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:18.530
 graphics means everyone else too 

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:21.019
 can but for some reason basically goes 

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:24.170
 some kind of garbage with a very primitive 

00:02:21.019 --> 00:02:26.090
 graphics if you win 1 2 part of it i 

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:29.360
 be sure to even play the third 

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:31.640
 because it's worth it 

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:34.810
 pluses well, of course very beautiful 

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:38.000
 graphics are quite convenient to manage 

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:39.950
 well minus the hub lack it whipped and 

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:42.170
 plot yes you just throws us not 

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:42.680
 understand where things are not know what and from 

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:45.230
 found 

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:47.690
 I have to think of a hint 

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:50.510
 as such there is no such, so here it is necessary 

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:53.209
 strain your brain's different applicant 

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:55.880
 there is also water well on water stock 

00:02:53.209 --> 00:02:58.670
 I couldnâ€™t get shorter 

00:02:55.880 --> 00:03:02.290
 three-dimensional adventure throughout the site in 

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:05.590
 it must play put the game data 

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:08.510
 solid four 

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:13.609
 more rude you see nothing is visible here 

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:16.069
 here by the way, I came in and found a way out 

00:03:13.609 --> 00:03:18.980
 here now here now here finally 

00:03:16.069 --> 00:03:20.359
 here is a business card and scales hit the birds sing 

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:23.150
 also various ideas well, that is, 

00:03:20.359 --> 00:03:25.940
 the situation has completely changed shorter ha 

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:29.299
 awesome cool and very beautiful 

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:31.310
