00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:12.139
 we write the first day of my 24th 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:14.910
 Partial advent calendar style 

00:00:12.139 --> 00:00:16.859
 Christmas action that meant you 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:20.250
 Join me now with a few facts 

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:20.550
 super mario showered the so relevant 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:23.279
 are 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:27.740
 that you have them in no later than three days 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:27.740
 again you forgot hurray 

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:36.140
 Super Mario Bros was the first game that 

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:37.700
 ever got a movie adaptation 

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:39.830
 and no 

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:43.580
 I do not mean super mario bros 

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:45.920
 the movie from the year 1993 but the 

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:50.090
 impossible for me to pronounce correctly 

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:55.420
 since 1986 appeared exclusively in Japan 

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:56.989
 because super mario bros page in the cinema too 

00:00:55.420 --> 00:01:03.500
 see 

00:00:56.989 --> 00:01:06.140
 This is what the star parts are called 

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:08.690
 from super mario galaxy are based on the 

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:13.310
 In Japan, quite popular sweets 

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:14.720
 with the name kombico I apologize 

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:20.090
 me again for the wrong pronunciation 

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:21.590
 and the not so nice emphasis in the 

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:24.560
 Japanese version of Super Mario 

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:26.660
 world it is possible the dolphins with the 

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:29.210
 Help yoshi eat 

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:31.100
 in all other versions that became 

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:33.229
 due to the deviant cultural 

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:36.830
 views in things whaling however 

00:01:33.229 --> 00:01:39.409
 removed and in the game boy advance 

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:44.810
 version is that for some reason 

00:01:39.409 --> 00:01:46.640
 but you can have it everywhere again 

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:48.380
 you surely always wonder how 

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:52.460
 because joschi in the space of super 

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:57.770
 Mario Galaxy can survive or no 

00:01:52.460 --> 00:02:00.049
 no matter the producer has yoshiaki koizumi 

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:04.369
 this question anyway with the following 

00:02:00.049 --> 00:02:10.280
 answers answered well that's because 

00:02:04.369 --> 00:02:12.429

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:12.429
 you know 

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:19.950
 So good my faithful soldier under the 

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:21.840
 flag of the mushroom army you should the 

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:24.060
 video better now a thumb after 

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:26.340
 give up because I'm the peter else 

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:29.550
 Tell that to play games in those 

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:32.459
 you can eat dolphins and believe me 

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:35.100
 you do not want to mess with them 

00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:39.780

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:45.080
