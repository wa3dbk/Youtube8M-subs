of<00:06:31.620> memory<00:06:31.890> on<00:06:32.130> your<00:06:32.370> Wii<00:06:32.550> if<00:06:32.850> you're<00:06:33.120> just

00:06:33.350 --> 00:06:33.360 
of memory on your Wii if you're just

00:06:33.360 --> 00:06:36.490 
of memory on your Wii if you're just
careful<00:06:33.840> as<00:06:33.960> to<00:06:34.140> how<00:06:34.230> you<00:06:34.290> go<00:06:34.500> about<00:06:34.620> it<00:06:34.770> and

the<00:06:37.500> SD<00:06:37.800> card<00:06:38.070> menu<00:06:38.250> is<00:06:38.490> probably<00:06:38.730> one<00:06:38.850> of<00:06:38.880> the

00:06:38.960 --> 00:06:38.970 
the SD card menu is probably one of the

00:06:38.970 --> 00:06:41.060 
the SD card menu is probably one of the
best<00:06:39.180> additions<00:06:39.900> that<00:06:39.990> the<00:06:40.350> Wii<00:06:40.590> has<00:06:40.740> come<00:06:40.920> out

00:06:41.060 --> 00:06:41.070 
best additions that the Wii has come out

00:06:41.070 --> 00:06:44.510 
best additions that the Wii has come out
with<00:06:41.100> recently<00:06:41.880> and<00:06:42.350> it<00:06:43.350> really<00:06:43.590> utilizes<00:06:44.340> the

00:06:44.510 --> 00:06:44.520 
with recently and it really utilizes the

00:06:44.520 --> 00:06:46.720 
with recently and it really utilizes the
memory<00:06:44.820> really<00:06:45.090> really<00:06:45.630> well<00:06:45.750> on<00:06:45.930> the<00:06:46.050> system

00:06:46.720 --> 00:06:46.730 
memory really really well on the system

00:06:46.730 --> 00:06:50.900 
memory really really well on the system
but<00:06:47.730> a<00:06:49.010> hard<00:06:50.010> drive<00:06:50.190> thing<00:06:50.370> has<00:06:50.550> to<00:06:50.700> come<00:06:50.880> up

00:06:50.900 --> 00:06:50.910 
but a hard drive thing has to come up

00:06:50.910 --> 00:06:53.120 
but a hard drive thing has to come up
because<00:06:51.120> I<00:06:51.510> mean<00:06:51.930> people<00:06:52.620> like<00:06:52.740> me<00:06:52.920> shouldn't

00:06:53.120 --> 00:06:53.130 
because I mean people like me shouldn't

00:06:53.130 --> 00:06:55.130 
because I mean people like me shouldn't
be<00:06:53.250> having<00:06:53.400> to<00:06:53.580> make<00:06:53.820> this<00:06:53.940> type<00:06:54.390> of<00:06:54.420> video<00:06:54.840> to

00:06:56.990 --> 00:06:57.000 
show you how to do this there should

00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:59.240
