00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.009
 I always saw to put the mess now 

00:00:01.650 --> 00:00:06.930
 front surgery are and 

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:08.460
 imagine yourself a cove and that is if you see it 

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:10.200
 we do not like to be noticed as the 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:12.420
 lines of expression truth by calling him 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:14.250
 nice but those on the forehead are fine 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:16.500
 difficult not to be marked because it 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:18.270
 try to gesture to the best of the 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:19.740
 sunny as they are doing with the 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:21.600
 step of the years definitely by 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:23.970
 here I also bring some practices in 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:26.279
 comets of thanks and welcome 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:28.019
 thank you tell us about this operation that 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:30.410
 can yes very beautiful that comes by 

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:30.410
 supposed 

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:34.440
 but to see how is this operation 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:37.590
 Tell us is good and it is important 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:40.379
 tell them that the forehead wrinkled like 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:43.170
 insists it makes you look angry or tired 

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:45.960
 or else then is the importance of 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:48.600
 this surgery and it seems is very important 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:51.449
 consider the position of the eyebrow 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:54.680
 then the woman's eyebrows do not know why 

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:56.630
 there we can throne image 

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:59.870
 it is a form of arc and it is just 

00:00:56.630 --> 00:01:03.230
 on the little bone the orbital rim 

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:05.720
 quite above that little bone and 

00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:07.820
 has to have a peak that peak 

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:09.470
 ends in two ways either when 

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:13.100
 they end up on a line where 

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:16.640
 ends in the pupil of the eye or where 

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:19.580
 ends exactly what needs to see if 

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:20.869
 you notice when the people you see 

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:23.180
 that that skin is falling what the 

00:01:20.869 --> 00:01:24.950
 front is going is crumpling what they do 

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:26.660
 women is and I'm talking every time 

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:28.250
 above the eyebrow to make it look more 

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:30.140
 raise the and brian more lifted 

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:32.180
 exactly and in the case of man 

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:34.820
 Well, the eyebrow is also there but 

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:36.680
 it's a straight eyebrow then when it's very 

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:38.869
 important to consider it will sometimes give 

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:41.899
 a fact that is good when it is given to 

00:01:38.869 --> 00:01:45.520
 patients are scared that when you already 

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:45.520
 you have is the other as 

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:49.520
 then that clear little bit that this 

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:51.079
 video is to do as more as scared 

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:54.820
 but well there are trends this is how 

00:01:51.079 --> 00:01:54.820
 Fashion is always this 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:00.760
 when patients tell doctors 

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:03.070
 I feel that I do not see that I am 

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:04.600
 already lowering the skin of the good eye is not 

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:07.570
 so much that it is the skin of the eye is that 

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:10.530
 all that is the brow and the forehead the skin 

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:13.330
 in front are falling or by god and 

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:15.459
 when they notice that they already have this 

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:16.959
 Chin goes saying I still feel like I 

00:02:15.459 --> 00:02:20.020
 is talking the dewlap have 

00:02:16.959 --> 00:02:22.660
 about 10 years that the skin of 

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:26.440
 the forehead began to descend and I do not know 

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:28.900
 I will declare them because we were talking 

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:30.850
 about wrinkles but if I think 

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:32.590
 that there are two types of wrinkles because 

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:33.970
 one is the one you get because of the excess 

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:35.590
 of skin that you already have here or 

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:37.060
 because it begins to fall a little bit 

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:39.220
 face and others what he does is for 

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:40.510
 gesticulate a lot of this type of surgery 

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:43.780
 which we are going to talk about is more like 

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:46.270
 so that it already has the skin citaca hirano 

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:48.400
 or be clear this type of wrinkles are 

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:49.989
 static wrinkles which we already have 

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:51.340
 because the crisis is falling and the 

00:02:49.989 --> 00:02:53.470
 dynamic wrinkles that are the 

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:55.630
 gesticulations to these dynamic routes 

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:56.920
 that is when we are talking we have already 

00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:59.470
 commented that they are treated with toxin 

00:02:56.920 --> 00:03:00.940
 botulinum is also a good idea that 

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:01.390
 if we perform this type of surgery 

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:03.010
 as well 

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:05.950
 we have a little bit of botulinum toxin 

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:07.540
 abbreviated where it is exactly the best 

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:09.850
 until we limit a little 

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:11.860
 let's delay that skin more than once 

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:13.660
 this organism this image is 

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:14.770
 showing how this surgery is done are 

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:17.530
 several incisions 

00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:19.990
 It used to be believed that it was known 

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:22.750
 of the headband does not go on one side of the 

00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:25.060
 ear be another tidy of the hair for 

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:26.320
 inside the hair and they raised that 

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:28.239
 part of the hair is now made of this 

00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:30.730
 way that is called minimum invasion 

00:03:28.239 --> 00:03:32.680
 there is still one that is with two 

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:33.970
 incisions that is the endoscopic and 

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:36.010
 we are usually drawn by plastics 

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:38.380
 we use this then it is an incision 

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:39.790
 that goes exactly in the middle does not 

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:42.850
 needs is a half time there goes the 

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:44.500
 first two that goes to parallel and other 

00:03:42.850 --> 00:03:46.510
 that go in the temporary region that is more 

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:48.910
 or less at the height of where are the 

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:50.890
 eyes in the skull then there are five 

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:53.320
 incisions these without conditions also 

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:55.030
 they serve to lift the part of the 

00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:56.830
 molars to the part of the cheekbones 

00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:59.560
 then with this surgery we can 

00:03:56.830 --> 00:04:01.180
 cover the forehead and part of the cheekbones 

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:04.210
 this one needs that also my conscience 

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:08.440
 it goes down not very well because back 

00:04:04.210 --> 00:04:10.360
 the one here in the nose then that's 

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:12.250
 the effect there are no people who say good 

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:15.370
 who is the candidate simply 

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:17.730
 you with your hands raise thus the 

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:17.730
 eyebrows 

00:04:20.790 --> 00:04:31.660
 they are all useless 

00:04:29.170 --> 00:04:33.610
 Well, you can find varieties 

00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:35.320
 in this I did not tell you that there are colleagues 

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:37.780
 that can charge 15 thousand answers 

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:40.150
 surgery and others in the world that charge 

00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:42.700
 50 thousand pesos then well this is very 

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:43.720
 I recommend that you make a 

00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:46.090
 evaluation with a plastic surgeon 

00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:48.580
 certificate and having several options 

00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:50.560
 not to see what it is that most 

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:52.870
 agrees and who is the one who can best 

00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:57.280
 convince you to uncover that kind of 

00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:59.920
 processes only one cross is required 

00:04:57.280 --> 00:05:01.960
 it's called trump and blatter currently 

00:04:59.920 --> 00:05:04.810
 local anesthesia or is an anesthetic 

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:06.730
 general for which it is preferred to have 

00:05:04.810 --> 00:05:08.800
 general anesthesia although it is more 

00:05:06.730 --> 00:05:12.520
 invasive however we can 

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:14.110
 this surgery with local anesthesia 

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:16.990
 let's inject when the 

00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:18.669
 images almost xylocaine with a 

00:05:16.990 --> 00:05:20.979
 substance that does not come out is that 

00:05:18.669 --> 00:05:23.289
 the vessels become smaller and that 

00:05:20.979 --> 00:05:25.389
 have intravenous sedation for the 

00:05:23.289 --> 00:05:26.889
 vein that are putting medications that 

00:05:25.389 --> 00:05:28.870
 they make you be asleep as 

00:05:26.889 --> 00:05:31.030
 relaxed that is not bothering you so much 

00:05:28.870 --> 00:05:32.770
 I think this is from the mornings 13 days 

00:05:31.030 --> 00:05:33.729
 that's where we're marking one of the 

00:05:32.770 --> 00:05:35.500
 incisions 

00:05:33.729 --> 00:05:37.740
 if you notice is one centimeter behind 

00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:39.879
 the fluff root is fine is not 

00:05:37.740 --> 00:05:41.229
 although there are important considerations 

00:05:39.879 --> 00:05:43.840
 look 

00:05:41.229 --> 00:05:45.849
 the study also up to the ojera not the 

00:05:43.840 --> 00:05:47.770
 little bags downstairs she was made 

00:05:45.849 --> 00:05:50.289
 all that clear is very important 

00:05:47.770 --> 00:05:52.360
 mention that these sciences accompany 

00:05:50.289 --> 00:05:54.550
 an eyelid rejuvenation 

00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:56.349
 that would be ideal there are people who just 

00:05:54.550 --> 00:05:58.780
 wants to do the eyelids is very 

00:05:56.349 --> 00:06:00.400
 well you have to do your forehead without 

00:05:58.780 --> 00:06:03.009
 However, the plastic surgeon is 

00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:05.689
 forced to say if it is a candidate or not 

00:06:03.009 --> 00:06:08.149
 procedure could 

00:06:05.689 --> 00:06:10.279
 and do it together to have 

00:06:08.149 --> 00:06:12.979
 a better success me this lady of osse 

00:06:10.279 --> 00:06:15.649
 tired and angry headquarters itself in 

00:06:12.979 --> 00:06:19.429
 speed and that only the part 

00:06:15.649 --> 00:06:21.409
 frontal hey what are the post effects 

00:06:19.429 --> 00:06:24.259
 operative and stay abode you fan 

00:06:21.409 --> 00:06:26.299
 that happens clear the face and head 

00:06:24.259 --> 00:06:28.009
 Well, they are very sensitive 

00:06:26.299 --> 00:06:30.409
 then if you can leave the 

00:06:28.009 --> 00:06:33.469
 bruises you can swell you have to 

00:06:30.409 --> 00:06:35.989
 use a bandage for at least 48 hours 

00:06:33.469 --> 00:06:38.089
 that we reviewed and well if you're good 

00:06:35.989 --> 00:06:40.729
 we send you to apply ice that is 

00:06:38.089 --> 00:06:42.469
 The immediate effect is very 

00:06:40.729 --> 00:06:44.479
 you are going to notice us the team that makes 

00:06:42.469 --> 00:06:47.209
 shut in place if we just 

00:06:44.479 --> 00:06:49.999
 there is some eyelid surgery not 

00:06:47.209 --> 00:06:51.800
 is fully aware or that you already 

00:06:49.999 --> 00:06:53.659
 we remove that excess skin and how 

00:06:51.800 --> 00:06:55.729
 I always tell them 80 percent of the 

00:06:53.659 --> 00:06:57.949
 result we have it a month since it is 

00:06:55.729 --> 00:06:59.029
 completely disinflated and 100% to the 

00:06:57.949 --> 00:07:00.949
 3 months 

00:06:59.029 --> 00:07:02.749
 then the genicio good how long 

00:07:00.949 --> 00:07:05.269
 I have to take it here if I 

00:07:02.749 --> 00:07:06.709
 I recommend especially if they have if their 

00:07:05.269 --> 00:07:09.019
 work is in contact with the 

00:07:06.709 --> 00:07:10.790
 people who take 15 days to 

00:07:09.019 --> 00:07:13.190
 then you can feel good 

00:07:10.790 --> 00:07:14.180
 they are swollen they do not have any 

00:07:13.190 --> 00:07:16.040
 problem 

00:07:14.180 --> 00:07:17.510
 ok I have a little curiosity with 

00:07:16.040 --> 00:07:19.100
 regarding surgery what is that as 

00:07:17.510 --> 00:07:21.350
 that have been recorded 

00:07:19.100 --> 00:07:25.010
 it is cut published that you have as of 

00:07:21.350 --> 00:07:29.810
 access as cover as he does join 

00:07:25.010 --> 00:07:32.750
 good if we use a few threads like that then 

00:07:29.810 --> 00:07:34.400
 they are sutures that are taken let's say a 

00:07:32.750 --> 00:07:36.680
 end of this side and we take it to 

00:07:34.400 --> 00:07:38.660
 take out the boxes and skin presentation 

00:07:36.680 --> 00:07:40.250
 that on column cuts there is 

00:07:38.660 --> 00:07:41.810
 It was very interesting this kind of 

00:07:40.250 --> 00:07:43.100
 this one of procedures and surgeries but 

00:07:41.810 --> 00:07:44.510
 we no longer know that the most important thing 

00:07:43.100 --> 00:07:46.100
 always come with a true 

00:07:44.510 --> 00:07:47.750
 specialist and good to prove that 

00:07:46.100 --> 00:07:49.130
 you are effectively a candidate for one of
