00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:11.920
 decided to do the manicure of the wishes 

00:00:09.070 --> 00:00:15.670
 and for new years and I saw these sticks 

00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:18.850
 cute from shuttle with this fantasy 

00:00:15.670 --> 00:00:21.279
 made everything like lace and it really is the 

00:00:18.850 --> 00:00:24.310
 i find it very sexy very pretty for 

00:00:21.279 --> 00:00:26.320
 New Year's Eve just these if 

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:29.410
 you are curious and want to take them 

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:31.210
 they are called black boudoir ok so they are 

00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:33.300
 still unpublished flavor I think it 

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:36.370
 you all know and I really am 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:37.930
 very easy to apply so I know 

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:40.780
 that you probably already have it too 

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:42.940
 used you know how to apply them but I wanted it like this 

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:45.520
 give you an idea let me see how I 

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:47.680
 decided to have all my nails done 

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:49.890
 precisely for the night of New Year that 

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:51.880
 so i hope you find the videos 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:53.770
 interesting i hope you like it 

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:54.550
 especially my idea for nails 

00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:56.740
 for new year 

00:00:54.550 --> 00:00:59.220
 now I leave you tutorials and we will 

00:00:56.740 --> 00:00:59.220
 we'll see later 

00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:08.340
 here we are, so I did my whole hand 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:11.390
 right look how nice the effect is 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:12.690
 I find it very sexy and above all suitable for 

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:15.030
 New Year 

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:16.950
 you see all the lace and then it's beautiful 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:20.190
 because there are also small glitters 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:24.270
 sini and therefore I go to do this other 

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:26.280
 hand and here are just the stickers 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:28.320
 which I will use and then said there is also the 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:31.080
 leaflet with instructions 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:34.830
 even though I'm sure you know by now 

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:38.009
 use them all these secret shuttles for 

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:40.500
 the note here we finally need the 

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:41.040
 leaf mario this from cardboard always of 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:44.100
 sofora 

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:46.710
 first we choose the sticker of the 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:52.170
 fit size so I'm going to remove the 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:56.430
 transparent film then I take one 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:02:00.229
 silver tongue and detachment then it 

00:01:56.430 --> 00:02:03.479
 nail polish and you need to hold the nail polish 

00:02:00.229 --> 00:02:05.490
 on the side of the silver tongue e 

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:09.380
 then the rounded side we go to 

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:09.380
 apply it to the nail base 

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:23.280
 ok and then simply let's try 

00:02:18.849 --> 00:02:26.280
 to touch, let's say, along the nail 

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:26.280
 the adhesive 

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:41.280
 then if by chance we say the sticker is a 

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:43.530
 these are little bit large for the nail 

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:47.520
 really fantastic because you just have to go 

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:49.880
 with the lime in this way it comes off 

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:52.380
 immediately then also laterally you see 

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:54.060
 so it comes right so you see ha 

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:57.180
 clean and precise 

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:59.070
 so I advise you with the file to do 

00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:01.740
 also laterally therefore to file 

00:02:59.070 --> 00:03:03.560
 also laterally as well as in front and 

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:07.980
 that's it done you see it's really 

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:11.060
 very simple and so I proceed in this way 

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:11.060
 the rest of the nails 

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:40.130
 ok so here I hope to have you 

00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:40.730
 given a nice idea for nails for 

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:42.910
 New Year 

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:45.440
 I like to say I find them really sexy 

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:47.000
 very suitable for the strata therefore with 

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:49.550
 This will send you a kiss I make 

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:53.230
 best wishes again for the holidays and us 

00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:53.230
