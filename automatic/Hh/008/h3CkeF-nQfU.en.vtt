00:00:07.570 --> 00:00:12.110
 hello guys we are here for another biology class and today's subject 

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:14.870
 about photosynthesis 

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:18.550
 the process is super important for the lives of animals and plants 

00:00:19.679 --> 00:00:22.259
 and to our initial question 

00:00:22.259 --> 00:00:23.200
 accompany 

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:26.530
 how photosynthesis interferes with the production of 

00:00:26.530 --> 00:00:28.560
 petronon 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:33.540
 this important process for the life of animals and also of plants 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:36.640
 besides helping in the nutrition process because through the 

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:38.219
 photosynthesis than the vegetable 

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:40.089
 produces its food 

00:00:40.089 --> 00:00:42.870
 and feed is transferred to the animals 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:47.569
 it also collaborates as an energy source as in the case of oil 

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:52.030
 help in the formation of oil now how can this process 

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:54.319
 participate in oil formation 

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:57.409
 This is what we are going to talk about in class. 

00:00:57.990 --> 00:01:01.770
 the whole process how to act in the life of living beings 

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:06.079
 so if you now have some important images 

00:01:06.079 --> 00:01:09.260
 we have the image of a vegetable folia 

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:11.010
 the water intake 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:14.140
 brought by the root that was mine. 

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:18.399
 absorbed by the root arriving until it was through the car 

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:24.190
 in the hospitalized region outside we will find vegetable acerola 

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:29.780
 the seattle scene the presence of the knots did not pass 

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:33.290
 observe that it occurred in the internal large pyanema platform 

00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:35.520
 and besides renata and external 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:38.780
 The inner region of the skull passed through the west at sea. 

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:40.700
 and we have there 

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:43.710
 running style says watch the sap 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:44.510
 India 

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:47.510
 structures where we will find there 

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:51.650
 colorau row important pigment for the process of photosynthesis 

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:55.240
 put to wish 

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:58.729
 folia is the main organ responsible for photosynthesis 

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:02.719
 because there we find the chloroplasts 

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:04.990
 we found the chlorophyll 

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:07.969
 responsible for the absorption of light 

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:10.209
 but in addition to the presence of chlorophyll 

00:02:10.209 --> 00:02:14.529
 the environment must be here nothing but we have to try to change 

00:02:14.529 --> 00:02:16.450
 to participate in this process 

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:20.019
 why is the light that will help in the synthesis of photosynthesis 

00:02:20.729 --> 00:02:23.649
 so to summarize like this process 

00:02:23.649 --> 00:02:26.139
 I would like you to always follow 

00:02:26.139 --> 00:02:28.949
 the photosynthesis equation 

00:02:28.949 --> 00:02:31.809
 then the general equation of photosynthesis then to run the 

00:02:31.809 --> 00:02:33.949
 process has to have water 

00:02:33.949 --> 00:02:35.489
 h2oh 

00:02:35.489 --> 00:02:39.019
 of al aqsa of carbon or carbon dioxide that drives 2 

00:02:39.529 --> 00:02:41.679
 and need the light 

00:02:41.679 --> 00:02:42.999
 darco parrot daughter 

00:02:42.999 --> 00:02:45.589
 green pigment found in vegetables 

00:02:45.589 --> 00:02:48.589
 that the folder is not present 

00:02:49.409 --> 00:02:55.149
 translating 6:12 to 6 agricultural carbohydrates and 

00:02:55.149 --> 00:02:59.079
 also producing water and producing something that serginho will be 

00:02:59.079 --> 00:03:02.009
 subsequently released 

00:03:02.009 --> 00:03:05.179
 to be used by animals 

00:03:05.179 --> 00:03:08.589
 tacoma every month and preserve we have to have nudes 

00:03:09.099 --> 00:03:10.309
 chlorophyll 

00:03:10.309 --> 00:03:15.979
 to perform the process of synthesis of water transformation 

00:03:15.979 --> 00:03:17.609
 one of these carbon days 

00:03:17.609 --> 00:03:18.750
 there is a record 

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:20.480
 in carbohydrate 

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:25.540
 which is the staple food for vegetables and that carbohydrate is going 

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:28.150
 give rise to other substances 

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:31.119
 which will also be necessary to live the vegetable 

00:03:31.119 --> 00:03:33.929
 for their growth development 

00:03:33.929 --> 00:03:35.500
 and also of production 

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:39.640
 so basically carbohydrate is the necessary food for life to two 

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:44.860
 vegetables why vegetables are considered to be fox buses 

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:48.099
 they can produce their own food 

00:03:48.629 --> 00:03:52.420
 now the photosynthesis is such a wide process 

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:55.890
 and to facilitate the understanding of these processes 

00:03:56.439 --> 00:03:59.999
 I would like you to observe the phases of photosynthesis 

00:04:02.329 --> 00:04:05.329
 so we have there the process divided into two steps 

00:04:06.389 --> 00:04:11.639
 the luminous stage or do it - and also known as making photochemistry 

00:04:12.329 --> 00:04:14.809
 it's dark there 

00:04:14.809 --> 00:04:16.419
 or chemical 

00:04:16.419 --> 00:04:18.489
 also known as step 

00:04:18.489 --> 00:04:21.549
 of the entire process 

00:04:21.549 --> 00:04:23.770
 in the name of our step 

00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:27.020
 he himself is not saying we have the presence of the 

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:28.499
 bush 

00:04:28.499 --> 00:04:30.629
 participating in the process 

00:04:30.629 --> 00:04:35.259
 and this light it will be absorbed by the krona the son in the green perimeter of the 

00:04:35.259 --> 00:04:36.460
 vegetables 

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:39.590
 the protein becomes excited and the presence of light 

00:04:40.229 --> 00:04:43.229
 release the energy 

00:04:44.199 --> 00:04:47.180
 this energy released by the clear thin 

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:48.690
 this responsible 

00:04:48.690 --> 00:04:50.740
 in the formation of a compound 

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:53.740
 energy known as tarp 

00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:57.670
 which means they have adenosine 

00:05:00.199 --> 00:05:02.419
 in fact it is the energy 

00:05:02.419 --> 00:05:04.939
 that will be used by fish 

00:05:04.939 --> 00:05:07.849
 in all its processes 

00:05:07.849 --> 00:05:11.759
 realize what the adept is formed from the home vpl 

00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:13.360
 more 

00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:16.590
 the pei that is the phosphate or owen and owen 

00:05:17.439 --> 00:05:18.849
 as we have seen 

00:05:18.849 --> 00:05:21.509
 in this process of photosynthesis 

00:05:21.509 --> 00:05:24.089
 atp was formed 

00:05:24.089 --> 00:05:27.089
 because of the presence of light energy 

00:05:28.059 --> 00:05:31.059
 the light energy converted into chemical energy 

00:05:31.759 --> 00:05:33.169
 I believed 

00:05:33.169 --> 00:05:35.889
 atp is also well known 

00:05:35.889 --> 00:05:39.800
 because it is an energetic source for our metabolism 

00:05:40.449 --> 00:05:42.580
 for the metabolism of living things 

00:05:42.580 --> 00:05:45.729
 generally so many animals as the vegetables 

00:05:45.729 --> 00:05:49.699
 now let's continue our process the fact 

00:05:49.699 --> 00:05:51.589
 chemistry of photosynthesis 

00:05:51.589 --> 00:05:54.879
 when boil approach photosynthesis reaction
