and I thought I'd take a little video
that<00:08:03.530> some<00:08:03.770> people<00:08:04.070> see<00:08:04.970> what<00:08:05.480> can<00:08:05.690> be<00:08:05.720> done<00:08:05.990> in

00:08:06.340 --> 00:08:06.350 
that some people see what can be done in

00:08:06.350 --> 00:08:09.760 
that some people see what can be done in
a<00:08:06.650> small<00:08:06.950> space<00:08:07.280> and<00:08:08.169> I<00:08:09.169> hope<00:08:09.410> this<00:08:09.590> video

00:08:09.760 --> 00:08:09.770 
a small space and I hope this video

00:08:09.770 --> 00:08:11.740 
a small space and I hope this video
turns<00:08:10.160> out<00:08:10.370> good<00:08:10.610> because<00:08:10.910> like<00:08:11.419> I<00:08:11.450> say<00:08:11.720> I

00:08:11.740 --> 00:08:11.750
