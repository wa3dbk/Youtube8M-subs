 whatever i just whats up i do 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:13.349
 my mobile phone h and yes we are we whole 

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:16.289
 interesting to look at 

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:17.850
 because I'm just these top new apps 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:20.490
 discovered and so I must me 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:23.340
 quite interesting that I spend the evening in 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:25.199
 dear audience wish me and yes that 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:27.650
 I'll do it now and I would 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:32.399
 say we just start right away 

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:35.640
 I have the iphone 5 in silver here 

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:38.010
 and already come down really handy 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:40.980
 It's because she can already 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:42.690
 you fell down and so you 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:45.120
 are not that delicious anymore 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:46.469
 form error is already partially ignored 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:49.309
 Just time I'm just not yet 

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:52.170
 come to want to buy new hands 

00:00:49.309 --> 00:00:54.989
 and hopefully the wrong thing will happen 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:57.629
 I just pay attention to what I pay 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:58.710
 my cellphone but that's how we start 

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:00.570
 Here is just my normal 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:02.760
 home screen and here I have 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:04.979
 all the apps are already on 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:08.420
 The mobile phone above were like photos calendar 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:10.979
 news and so on and now to 

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:14.040
 next page where i see all my apps 

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:17.460
 I downloaded first 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:19.259
 blocked here and I look 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:21.450
 I always liked to be the recipe so 

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:22.710
 is easy to imitate and to 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:24.420
 get inspirations 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:25.979
 I think the app is actually quite good 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:28.680
 You can also watch the videos here 

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:30.299
 watch them and such a workout calendar 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:33.869
 I do not do something personally 

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:38.490

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:41.189

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:59.340

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:02.070

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:05.130

 and yes I love tumblr as if it were still 

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:39.620
 no tumblr should definitely have a look 

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:42.530

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:13.040
 in the radio and does not know what it's called 

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:15.140
 then you click on it and he recognizes 

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:17.900
 then just the song that very convenient 

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:20.840

00:03:25.519 --> 00:03:30.350
 you really have a lot of bad tracks 

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:32.989
 So just say you give yours 

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:36.890

00:03:32.989 --> 00:03:38.209

 that belongs and I'm just very 

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:44.750
 practical and ex I almost believe 

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:46.370
 my favorite app besides instagram and 

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:48.560
 then i'll have another club 

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:51.080
 You can also listen to songs if you like 

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:53.709
 no internet just search then 

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:57.650
 could hear it all the time 

00:03:53.709 --> 00:04:02.840
 then of course I have youtube there okay 

00:03:57.650 --> 00:04:08.390
 youtube crashed interesting what 

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:10.400
 my ok youtube crashed yes and 

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:13.030
 then I have a movie easy to 

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:15.620
 to edit small films on the mobile phone 

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:19.519
 Here I have my facebook and then the 

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:24.410
 big day light up and you can 

00:04:19.519 --> 00:04:25.820
 just give your own rhine and then 

00:04:24.410 --> 00:04:28.460
 Count the days and you can do it here 

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:30.380
 beautify so blabla and of course zara 

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:32.210
 because I just like to go easy and go 

00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:34.690
 I do not know where I get bored 

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:37.810
 how did you downloaded the app 

00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:40.220
 Download everything 

00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:41.750
 no idea is easy as a driver I 

00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:43.490
 believe that we serve services because ball 

00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:46.310
 Often I am there too 

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:51.800
 not and then I have something here 

00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:53.449
 times bb scotty very cool so if you 

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:56.720
 For example, where do you want to go? 

00:04:53.449 --> 00:05:00.020
 do not know how and that just says how 

00:04:56.720 --> 00:05:01.550
 get there the fastest bus in which 

00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:03.590
 to drive and that is now 

00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:05.360
 for Austria but I think that gives 

00:05:03.590 --> 00:05:06.190
 look for germany so what 

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:08.810
 something similar 

00:05:06.190 --> 00:05:10.699
 and yes, and then I still have the hand 

00:05:08.810 --> 00:05:12.550
 I was too lazy until now 

00:05:10.699 --> 00:05:15.470
 I have to say yes 

00:05:12.550 --> 00:05:17.750
 madness but just there you can do so 

00:05:15.470 --> 00:05:19.820
 Upload photos of sarhan probably not 

00:05:17.750 --> 00:05:23.900
 know where they are from and he tells you 

00:05:19.820 --> 00:05:26.300
 then from where that is and yes or where it is 

00:05:23.900 --> 00:05:28.669
 Similar things are there and I should 

00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:32.690
 log in and yes it might be 

00:05:28.669 --> 00:05:35.090
 not a bad plan from the iphone 

00:05:32.690 --> 00:05:37.550
 iphone day and i hope you have 

00:05:35.090 --> 00:05:39.680
 reasonably it was found and what I am 

00:05:37.550 --> 00:05:41.810
 to say otherwise is that starting next 

00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:42.080
 week my back to school series start 

00:05:41.810 --> 00:05:44.030

00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:46.190
 so it's gonna be three 

00:05:44.030 --> 00:05:46.729
 smaller videos on the subject of back to school 

00:05:46.190 --> 00:05:49.220

 the fans cool as dyed and yes if 

00:05:52.759 --> 00:05:56.150
 I say all that is that I again 

00:05:54.229 --> 00:05:58.219
 did a blog and this time 

00:05:56.150 --> 00:05:59.690

00:06:01.610 --> 00:06:06.259
 I linked my blog and the 

00:06:04.580 --> 00:06:08.150
 link is synonymous if now on my channel 

00:06:06.259 --> 00:06:10.219
 So no, she always does that 

00:06:08.150 --> 00:06:12.500
 drop by and even then 

00:06:10.219 --> 00:06:15.380
