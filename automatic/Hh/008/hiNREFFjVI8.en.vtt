iphone win the case you can see it this
case<00:01:57.180> on<00:01:57.420> the<00:01:57.509> back<00:01:57.689> looks<00:01:57.960> very<00:01:58.259> minimalistic

00:01:58.819 --> 00:01:58.829 
case on the back looks very minimalistic

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:00.109 
case on the back looks very minimalistic
and<00:01:59.100> it's<00:01:59.280> pretty<00:01:59.460> much<00:01:59.579> like<00:01:59.700> a<00:01:59.820> white

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:00.119 
and it's pretty much like a white

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:02.090 
and it's pretty much like a white
streamlined<00:02:00.719> design<00:02:00.840> with<00:02:01.320> the<00:02:01.350> blue<00:02:01.680> on<00:02:01.920> the

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:02.100 
streamlined design with the blue on the

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:04.399 
streamlined design with the blue on the
edges<00:02:02.549> and<00:02:02.700> as<00:02:03.270> i<00:02:03.570> said<00:02:03.630> it<00:02:03.899> doubles<00:02:04.229> as<00:02:04.350> a

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:04.409 
edges and as i said it doubles as a

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:05.840 
edges and as i said it doubles as a
kickstand<00:02:04.979> as<00:02:05.100> well<00:02:05.250> as<00:02:05.310> a<00:02:05.369> credit<00:02:05.670> card

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:05.850

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:07.530 
holder you can see that the bottom is

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:09.619 
holder you can see that the bottom is
pretty<00:02:07.860> well<00:02:08.009> exposed<00:02:08.580> although<00:02:09.239> the<00:02:09.420> sides

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:09.629 
pretty well exposed although the sides

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:11.330 
pretty well exposed although the sides
are<00:02:09.840> have<00:02:10.289> the<00:02:10.440> little<00:02:10.739> pieces<00:02:10.920> to<00:02:11.160> hold

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:11.340 
are have the little pieces to hold

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:12.710 
are have the little pieces to hold
together<00:02:11.489> so<00:02:11.849> the<00:02:11.970> bottom<00:02:12.120> what<00:02:12.390> we<00:02:12.480> really

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:12.720 
together so the bottom what we really

00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:57.090 
cases where they stick up quite a bit

00:02:57.090 --> 00:02:58.520 
cases where they stick up quite a bit
but<00:02:57.270> you're<00:02:57.390> able<00:02:57.510> just<00:02:57.750> slide<00:02:58.140> the<00:02:58.290> card

00:02:58.520 --> 00:02:58.530

but you're able just slide the card
right<00:02:58.680> out<00:02:58.860> but<00:02:59.310> i<00:02:59.340> really<00:02:59.580> don't<00:02:59.610> mind<00:02:59.850> just

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:00.060 
right out but i really don't mind just

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:01.610 
right out but i really don't mind just
having<00:03:00.270> to<00:03:00.360> open<00:03:00.480> the<00:03:00.720> latch<00:03:00.930> and<00:03:01.170> you<00:03:01.290> can<00:03:01.410> fit

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:01.620 
having to open the latch and you can fit

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:03.050 
having to open the latch and you can fit
quite<00:03:01.860> a<00:03:01.920> few<00:03:02.100> credit<00:03:02.430> cards<00:03:02.459> actually<00:03:03.000> you

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:03.060 
quite a few credit cards actually you

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:05.030 
quite a few credit cards actually you
can<00:03:03.180> see<00:03:03.330> it<00:03:03.420> fits<00:03:03.600> if<00:03:03.959> form<00:03:04.440> fit<00:03:04.590> to<00:03:04.740> the<00:03:04.830> size

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:05.040 
can see it fits if form fit to the size

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:06.470 
can see it fits if form fit to the size
of<00:03:05.310> the<00:03:05.430> card<00:03:05.730> which<00:03:05.970> could<00:03:06.300> be<00:03:06.450> a

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:06.480 
of the card which could be a

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:08.480 
of the card which could be a
disadvantage<00:03:06.930> in<00:03:07.590> case<00:03:07.770> your<00:03:07.920> cards<00:03:08.220> a<00:03:08.280> little

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:08.490 
disadvantage in case your cards a little

00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:10.550 
disadvantage in case your cards a little
bit<00:03:08.580> big<00:03:08.790> but<00:03:09.030> i'd<00:03:09.480> say<00:03:09.720> it<00:03:09.870> should<00:03:10.140> fit<00:03:10.320> most

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:10.560 
bit big but i'd say it should fit most

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:12.920 
bit big but i'd say it should fit most
cards<00:03:10.950> like<00:03:11.070> your<00:03:11.220> visa<00:03:11.459> your<00:03:11.790> bank<00:03:12.030> card<00:03:12.150> most

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:12.930 
cards like your visa your bank card most

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:14.480 
cards like your visa your bank card most
of<00:03:13.050> those<00:03:13.140> cards<00:03:13.620> that<00:03:13.770> you'd<00:03:13.890> probably<00:03:14.190> want

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:14.490 
of those cards that you'd probably want

00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:16.490 
of those cards that you'd probably want
to<00:03:14.610> carry<00:03:14.820> all<00:03:15.030> around<00:03:15.360> with<00:03:15.630> you<00:03:15.870> and<00:03:16.080> any

00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:16.500 
to carry all around with you and any

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:18.199 
to carry all around with you and any
other<00:03:16.740> unnecessary<00:03:17.190> cards<00:03:17.880> you<00:03:17.970> probably

00:03:18.199 --> 00:03:18.209 
other unnecessary cards you probably

00:03:18.209 --> 00:03:20.509 
other unnecessary cards you probably
just<00:03:18.360> carry<00:03:18.600> in<00:03:18.750> a<00:03:18.840> pocket<00:03:19.080> or<00:03:19.350> wallet<00:03:19.830> so<00:03:20.400> you

00:03:20.509 --> 00:03:20.519 
just carry in a pocket or wallet so you

00:03:20.519 --> 00:03:21.500 
just carry in a pocket or wallet so you
look<00:03:20.670> at<00:03:20.760> the<00:03:20.880> front<00:03:21.090> you<00:03:21.209> can<00:03:21.239> see<00:03:21.330> that

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:21.510 
look at the front you can see that

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:22.940 
look at the front you can see that
there's<00:03:21.690> a<00:03:21.780> lay<00:03:21.930> on<00:03:22.050> the<00:03:22.170> table<00:03:22.200> design<00:03:22.680> which

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:22.950 
there's a lay on the table design which

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:24.680 
there's a lay on the table design which
is<00:03:23.100> really<00:03:23.700> really<00:03:23.940> great<00:03:24.150> i<00:03:24.239> have<00:03:24.420> to<00:03:24.570> say

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:24.690 
is really really great i have to say

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:26.180 
is really really great i have to say
this<00:03:24.840> case<00:03:25.080> is<00:03:25.110> a<00:03:25.260> lot<00:03:25.530> like<00:03:25.709> the<00:03:25.860> speck

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:26.190 
this case is a lot like the speck

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:28.310 
this case is a lot like the speck
candyshell<00:03:26.850> case<00:03:26.880> in<00:03:27.390> terms<00:03:27.600> of<00:03:27.720> its<00:03:27.900> hybrid

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:28.320 
candyshell case in terms of its hybrid

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:30.229 
candyshell case in terms of its hybrid
construction<00:03:28.620> but<00:03:29.610> the<00:03:29.760> look<00:03:30.000> and<00:03:30.209> the

00:03:30.229 --> 00:03:30.239 
construction but the look and the

00:03:30.239 --> 00:03:32.479 
construction but the look and the
quality<00:03:30.690> and<00:03:30.930> feel<00:03:31.350> is<00:03:31.650> just<00:03:31.830> great<00:03:32.100> in<00:03:32.310> this

00:03:32.479 --> 00:03:32.489 
quality and feel is just great in this

00:03:32.489 --> 00:03:34.370

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:34.380 
case and i really like the functionality

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:36.890 
case and i really like the functionality
especially<00:03:35.190> as<00:03:35.310> being<00:03:35.580> someone<00:03:35.970> who<00:03:36.180> tends<00:03:36.840> to
