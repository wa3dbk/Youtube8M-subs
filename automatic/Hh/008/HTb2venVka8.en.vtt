way the other way around but it will

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:38.950 
way the other way around but it will
always<00:02:37.940> be<00:02:38.030> that<00:02:38.270> way<00:02:38.300> around<00:02:38.630> people<00:02:38.870> it

wasn't a rowing for a movie will always

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:41.830 
wasn't a rowing for a movie will always
do<00:02:40.700> that<00:02:40.790> round<00:02:41.000> isn't<00:02:41.330> gonna<00:02:41.420> grab<00:02:41.570> the<00:02:41.690> best

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:41.840 
do that round isn't gonna grab the best

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:43.000 
do that round isn't gonna grab the best
way<00:02:41.960> otherwise<00:02:42.290> it'd<00:02:42.440> be<00:02:42.560> really<00:02:42.680> looking<00:02:42.950> at

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:43.010 
way otherwise it'd be really looking at

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:45.430 
way otherwise it'd be really looking at
me<00:02:43.610> like<00:02:43.760> a<00:02:43.820> fuel<00:02:44.120> the<00:02:44.240> job<00:02:44.450> they<00:02:45.170> did<00:02:45.350> the

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:45.440 
me like a fuel the job they did the

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:47.470 
me like a fuel the job they did the
hundred<00:02:45.740> and<00:02:45.800> show<00:02:45.980> these<00:02:46.160> women

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:47.480 
hundred and show these women

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:49.119 
hundred and show these women
if<00:02:47.810> the<00:02:47.989> cameras<00:02:48.530> on<00:02:48.620> the<00:02:48.709> bottom<00:02:48.980> what

00:02:49.119 --> 00:02:49.129 
if the cameras on the bottom what

00:02:49.129 --> 00:02:49.780 
if the cameras on the bottom what
happens

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:49.790 
happens

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:51.190 
happens
yeah<00:02:50.180> I<00:02:50.209> think<00:02:50.390> it<00:02:50.599> would<00:02:50.689> just<00:02:50.810> do<00:02:50.959> what<00:02:51.110> he's

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:51.200 
yeah I think it would just do what he's

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:52.539 
yeah I think it would just do what he's
doing<00:02:51.439> now<00:02:51.469> he<00:02:51.620> would<00:02:51.920> just<00:02:52.069> play<00:02:52.219> that<00:02:52.400> way

00:02:52.539 --> 00:02:52.549 
doing now he would just play that way

00:02:52.549 --> 00:03:02.660 
doing now he would just play that way
Wagner<00:02:53.150> know<00:02:53.209> ok<00:02:53.659> so<00:02:53.719> doesn't
