the National Building Museum has the

the National Building Museum has the

colonnade around it and we thought we

colonnade around it and we thought we
really<00:00:16.139> wanted<00:00:16.379> to<00:00:16.490> explore<00:00:17.490> the<00:00:17.760> third

animal's cognitive map of its
environment<00:01:06.900> and<00:01:07.290> we<00:01:08.010> build<00:01:08.280> that<00:01:08.430> cognitive

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
environment and we build that cognitive

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:10.820 
environment and we build that cognitive
map<00:01:09.150> to<00:01:09.360> allow<00:01:09.600> us<00:01:09.780> to<00:01:09.960> navigate<00:01:10.140> through<00:01:10.740> our

surroundings<00:01:11.990> the<00:01:12.990> hippocampus<00:01:13.619> actually<00:01:14.010> I

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040 
surroundings the hippocampus actually I

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:16.060 
surroundings the hippocampus actually I
think<00:01:14.189> operates<00:01:14.820> sort<00:01:15.060> of<00:01:15.150> in<00:01:15.240> two<00:01:15.420> modes<00:01:15.659> in

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:16.070 
think operates sort of in two modes in

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:18.620 
think operates sort of in two modes in
one<00:01:17.070> mode<00:01:17.310> it's<00:01:17.580> learning<00:01:17.820> a<00:01:18.000> maze<00:01:18.210> we<00:01:18.479> can

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
one mode it's learning a maze we can

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:20.210 
one mode it's learning a maze we can
call<00:01:18.810> that<00:01:18.840> acquisition<00:01:19.590> so<00:01:19.830> it's<00:01:19.950> keeping

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 
call that acquisition so it's keeping

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:22.850 
call that acquisition so it's keeping
track<00:01:20.460> of<00:01:20.490> the<00:01:20.729> new<00:01:20.850> spatial<00:01:21.150> landmarks<00:01:22.049> what

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:22.860 
track of the new spatial landmarks what

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:24.859 
track of the new spatial landmarks what
they<00:01:22.979> possibly<00:01:23.400> mean<00:01:23.700> and<00:01:23.939> then<00:01:24.600> there's<00:01:24.810> a

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
they possibly mean and then there's a

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:26.899 
they possibly mean and then there's a
another<00:01:25.290> mode<00:01:26.100> of<00:01:26.250> the<00:01:26.310> hippocampus<00:01:26.880> which

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:26.909 
another mode of the hippocampus which

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:28.789 
another mode of the hippocampus which
you<00:01:27.150> can<00:01:27.509> think<00:01:27.689> of<00:01:27.780> it's<00:01:27.930> the<00:01:27.990> readout<00:01:28.439> phase

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:28.799 
you can think of it's the readout phase

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:30.620 
you can think of it's the readout phase
so<00:01:29.369> the<00:01:29.520> hippocampus<00:01:30.090> is<00:01:30.240> actually

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
so the hippocampus is actually

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:32.480 
so the hippocampus is actually
automatically<00:01:31.320> reading<00:01:31.829> out<00:01:31.979> the<00:01:32.159> correct

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490 
automatically reading out the correct

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:35.539 
automatically reading out the correct
solution<00:01:33.000> to<00:01:33.090> the<00:01:33.180> maze<00:01:33.740> so<00:01:34.740> even<00:01:35.220> a<00:01:35.310> maze

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:35.549 
solution to the maze so even a maze

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:37.340 
solution to the maze so even a maze
that's<00:01:35.939> on<00:01:36.119> a<00:01:36.150> piece<00:01:36.390> of<00:01:36.540> paper<00:01:36.689> if<00:01:36.990> it's<00:01:37.140> done

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350 
that's on a piece of paper if it's done

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:40.069 
that's on a piece of paper if it's done
well<00:01:37.619> can<00:01:38.220> be<00:01:38.310> challenging<00:01:38.880> because<00:01:39.299> it's

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:40.079 
well can be challenging because it's

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:42.740 
well can be challenging because it's
sheer<00:01:40.500> complexity<00:01:41.150> forces<00:01:42.150> us<00:01:42.329> to<00:01:42.570> actually

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.750 
sheer complexity forces us to actually

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:45.560 
sheer complexity forces us to actually
keep<00:01:43.350> track<00:01:43.770> of<00:01:43.979> many<00:01:44.490> calculations<00:01:45.299> at<00:01:45.479> the

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 
keep track of many calculations at the

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:47.660 
keep track of many calculations at the
same<00:01:45.810> time<00:01:46.110> as<00:01:46.350> we<00:01:46.740> seek<00:01:46.979> to<00:01:47.009> navigate<00:01:47.549> the

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
same time as we seek to navigate the

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:50.719 
same time as we seek to navigate the
maze<00:01:47.850> so<00:01:48.439> we're<00:01:49.439> pretty<00:01:49.619> plastic<00:01:50.250> in<00:01:50.369> terms<00:01:50.579> of

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:50.729 
maze so we're pretty plastic in terms of

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:51.950 
maze so we're pretty plastic in terms of
our<00:01:50.850> behavior<00:01:51.270> and<00:01:51.360> I<00:01:51.450> think<00:01:51.479> that's<00:01:51.810> probably

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:51.960 
our behavior and I think that's probably

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:53.660 
our behavior and I think that's probably
because<00:01:52.259> we're<00:01:52.409> pretty<00:01:52.590> complex<00:01:53.040> organisms

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670 
because we're pretty complex organisms

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:55.580 
because we're pretty complex organisms
but<00:01:54.210> a<00:01:54.270> rodent<00:01:54.630> actually<00:01:54.930> has<00:01:55.110> simple

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590 
but a rodent actually has simple

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:57.830 
but a rodent actually has simple
responses<00:01:56.280> and<00:01:56.549> one<00:01:56.969> of<00:01:57.030> the<00:01:57.090> most<00:01:57.180> basics<00:01:57.689> on

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 
responses and one of the most basics on

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:59.389 
responses and one of the most basics on
a<00:01:57.869> why<00:01:58.110> maze<00:01:58.350> was<00:01:58.619> that<00:01:58.770> if<00:01:58.890> it's<00:01:59.009> gone<00:01:59.159> down

00:01:59.389 --> 00:01:59.399 
a why maze was that if it's gone down

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:01.550 
a why maze was that if it's gone down
one<00:01:59.640> arm<00:02:00.090> then<00:02:00.719> next<00:02:00.960> time<00:02:01.140> it's<00:02:01.290> gonna<00:02:01.350> go

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:01.560 
one arm then next time it's gonna go

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:03.080 
one arm then next time it's gonna go
down<00:02:01.710> the<00:02:01.860> other<00:02:01.890> arm<00:02:02.219> then<00:02:02.909> it<00:02:03.000> will

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:03.090 
down the other arm then it will

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:05.300 
down the other arm then it will

around<00:02:42.030> you<00:02:42.270> but<00:02:42.570> we<00:02:42.750> couldn't<00:02:43.050> really<00:02:43.200> figure

around you but we couldn't really figure

confusing<00:02:45.750> or<00:02:46.200> not<00:02:46.410> confusing<00:02:46.800> enough<00:02:46.920> so

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:47.820 
confusing or not confusing enough so

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:49.040 
confusing or not confusing enough so

when I walked through it the first time
I<00:02:49.080> was<00:02:49.410> like<00:02:49.560> really<00:02:49.740> happily<00:02:50.250> reassured<00:02:51.210> or

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:51.570 
I was like really happily reassured or

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:53.690 
I was like really happily reassured or

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:53.700 
relieved that we actually did he had

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:56.510 
relieved that we actually did he had
lost<00:02:53.880> quite<00:02:54.090> a<00:02:54.150> few<00:02:54.210> times
