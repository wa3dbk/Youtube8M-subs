00:00:18.019 --> 00:00:20.320
 pools present ten president 

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:24.630
 parents should not lower their guard to 0 before other dangers such as bathtubs 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:29.150
 Odorless cubes and other water containers a child can quickly give 

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:33.519
 in just a few covers of water the majority of deaths by drowning 

00:00:33.519 --> 00:00:36.140
 at home they occur in bathtubs 

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:39.990
 most of the deaths and accidents that occur in bathtubs happen when 

00:00:39.990 --> 00:00:44.200
 the caregiver is not in the bathroom with a child when the child is in the bathtub 

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:47.210
 keep it always close at hand 

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:51.870

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:56.250
 door today to find a towel another item if you have to leave the bathroom 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:58.210
 take children with you 

00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:01.980
 never leave a baby juan toddler a bathtub under the care of 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:06.220
 another small child no matter how safe a couple the most cent to harm 

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:10.610
 the baby has to be supervised while sitting in 

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:15.280
 these seats to bathe the baby facilitate the child's bath but not 

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:16.750
 a security team 

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:20.960
 Even when a child is in a seat to bathe you, you should always be 

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:23.050
 within reach of a child 

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:26.680
 cubes and valdés that are found in all homes are a 

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:31.650
 cult danger still with cube only have a small amount of liquid ever 

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:36.210

 young children are attracted to the ponds that are so 

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:44.020
 popular for home garden often these ponds do not have 

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:46.880
 barriers to prevent children's access 

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:51.100
 Children can fall headfirst into the toilet holding the toilet lid 

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:55.540
 down to prevent the child from having access to water I considered installing a 

00:01:55.539 --> 00:02:00.299
 padlock for toilet to prevent small children will the lid in addition 

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:03.900
 Consider installing a lock out of reach of children at the door of the 

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:04.670
 bathroom 

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:08.849
 remember that young children can drown in just a few inches of 

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:13.050
 water in the home do not leave children only near toilets 

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:15.390
 cobos and other water containers
