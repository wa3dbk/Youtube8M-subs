because<00:06:24.220> not<00:06:24.400> only<00:06:24.430> do<00:06:24.640> you<00:06:24.730> have<00:06:24.760> to<00:06:24.880> take<00:06:24.970> out

00:06:25.080 --> 00:06:25.090 
because not only do you have to take out

00:06:25.090 --> 00:06:27.000 
because not only do you have to take out
loans<00:06:25.120> for<00:06:25.540> the<00:06:25.600> school<00:06:25.900> but<00:06:26.470> you<00:06:26.500> also<00:06:26.710> had<00:06:26.950> to

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:27.010 
loans for the school but you also had to

00:06:27.010 --> 00:06:28.740 
loans for the school but you also had to
take<00:06:27.070> out<00:06:27.340> loans<00:06:27.490> to<00:06:27.760> pay<00:06:27.970> the<00:06:28.030> shadow<00:06:28.330> scholar

00:06:28.740 --> 00:06:28.750

00:06:31.470 --> 00:06:31.480 
right right so and the reason is they

00:06:31.480 --> 00:06:33.660 
right right so and the reason is they
want<00:06:31.690> it<00:06:31.780> for<00:06:31.900> prestige<00:06:32.410> they<00:06:32.740> wanted<00:06:33.070> to<00:06:33.520> be
