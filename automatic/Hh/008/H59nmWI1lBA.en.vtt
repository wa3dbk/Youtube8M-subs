Touches<00:01:57.170> now<00:01:58.040> said<00:01:58.250> this<00:01:58.400> is<00:01:58.520> a

00:01:58.540 --> 00:01:58.550 
Touches now said this is a

00:01:58.550 --> 00:02:00.220 
Touches now said this is a
multi-function<00:01:59.300> button<00:01:59.390> so<00:01:59.840> what<00:01:59.960> we<00:02:00.050> do<00:02:00.200> to

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:00.230 
multi-function button so what we do to

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:03.490 
multi-function button so what we do to
actually<00:02:00.680> use<00:02:01.190> the<00:02:01.460> device<00:02:01.790> is<00:02:02.090> we<00:02:02.900> plug<00:02:03.290> it<00:02:03.380> in

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:03.500 
actually use the device is we plug it in

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:06.190 
actually use the device is we plug it in
like<00:02:04.010> so<00:02:04.040> and<00:02:04.580> you<00:02:05.120> can<00:02:05.150> see<00:02:05.300> nothing's

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:06.200 
like so and you can see nothing's

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:07.930 
like so and you can see nothing's
happening<00:02:06.590> it's<00:02:06.770> not<00:02:06.800> charging<00:02:07.340> we<00:02:07.730> need<00:02:07.880> to

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:07.940 
happening it's not charging we need to

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:09.940 
happening it's not charging we need to
hold<00:02:08.060> this<00:02:08.239> multifunction<00:02:08.989> button<00:02:09.200> in<00:02:09.349> for

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:09.950 
hold this multifunction button in for

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:13.400 
hold this multifunction button in for
roughly<00:02:10.250> about<00:02:10.369> two<00:02:10.700> seconds

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410 

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:16.460 

and<00:02:14.100> then<00:02:14.310> that<00:02:14.460> initiates<00:02:14.970> charging<00:02:15.570> so<00:02:16.140> we

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:16.470 
and then that initiates charging so we

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:20.780 
and then that initiates charging so we
are<00:02:16.590> now<00:02:16.770> charging<00:02:17.340> our<00:02:17.640> iPhone<00:02:18.240> 5s<00:02:19.140> now<00:02:20.010> if

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:20.790 
are now charging our iPhone 5s now if

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:22.760 
are now charging our iPhone 5s now if
this<00:02:21.180> charge<00:02:21.540> is<00:02:21.690> completely<00:02:22.200> so<00:02:22.440> once<00:02:22.590> the

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:22.770 
this charge is completely so once the

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:25.130 
this charge is completely so once the
battery<00:02:23.100> reaches<00:02:23.490> a<00:02:23.520> hundred<00:02:23.790> percent<00:02:24.140> the

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:25.140 
battery reaches a hundred percent the

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:27.320 
battery reaches a hundred percent the
battery<00:02:26.070> on<00:02:26.160> here<00:02:26.430> or<00:02:26.610> actually<00:02:26.790> the<00:02:27.090> power

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:27.330 
battery on here or actually the power

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:28.700 
battery on here or actually the power
going<00:02:27.720> through<00:02:27.810> the<00:02:28.110> lightning<00:02:28.530> connector

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:28.710 
going through the lightning connector

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:30.050 
going through the lightning connector
will<00:02:28.950> actually<00:02:29.250> turn<00:02:29.460> off<00:02:29.700> so<00:02:29.910> it<00:02:29.970> will

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:30.060 
will actually turn off so it will

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:32.150 
will actually turn off so it will
conserve<00:02:30.570> the<00:02:30.810> battery<00:02:30.840> power<00:02:31.380> in<00:02:31.680> the

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:32.160 
conserve the battery power in the

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:35.000 
conserve the battery power in the
charger<00:02:32.670> or<00:02:33.060> indeed<00:02:33.600> if<00:02:33.840> it's<00:02:34.290> not<00:02:34.500> connected

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:35.010 
charger or indeed if it's not connected

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:37.190 
charger or indeed if it's not connected
to<00:02:35.040> a<00:02:35.160> device<00:02:35.490> if<00:02:35.790> we<00:02:35.970> unplug<00:02:36.450> like<00:02:36.660> so<00:02:36.960> and

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:37.200 
to a device if we unplug like so and

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:40.400 
to a device if we unplug like so and
this<00:02:37.680> is<00:02:37.830> left<00:02:38.190> for<00:02:38.910> roundabout<00:02:39.600> sorts<00:02:39.930> two<00:02:40.170> to

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:40.410 
this is left for roundabout sorts two to

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:41.810 
this is left for roundabout sorts two to
three<00:02:40.650> seconds<00:02:41.100> it<00:02:41.190> will<00:02:41.280> actually<00:02:41.430> turn

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:41.820 
three seconds it will actually turn

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:44.090 
three seconds it will actually turn
itself<00:02:42.180> off<00:02:42.420> all<00:02:42.900> we<00:02:43.230> can<00:02:43.440> hold<00:02:43.710> the<00:02:43.800> button<00:02:44.010> in

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:44.100 
itself off all we can hold the button in

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:46.790 
itself off all we can hold the button in
again<00:02:44.460> for<00:02:44.880> two<00:02:45.210> seconds<00:02:45.660> and<00:02:45.870> that<00:02:46.320> will<00:02:46.350> turn

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:46.800 
again for two seconds and that will turn

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:48.860 
again for two seconds and that will turn
the<00:02:47.160> device<00:02:47.280> off<00:02:47.670> as<00:02:47.850> well<00:02:48.030> you<00:02:48.420> can<00:02:48.570> see<00:02:48.690> those

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:48.870 
the device off as well you can see those

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:51.140 
the device off as well you can see those
LEDs<00:02:49.350> just<00:02:49.380> counted<00:02:50.010> down<00:02:50.190> to<00:02:50.790> let<00:02:50.940> you<00:02:51.030> know

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:51.150 
LEDs just counted down to let you know

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:53.630 
LEDs just counted down to let you know
you've<00:02:51.360> turned<00:02:51.630> it<00:02:51.810> off<00:02:51.930> so<00:02:52.830> again<00:02:53.040> we<00:02:53.310> plug<00:02:53.520> it

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:53.640 
you've turned it off so again we plug it

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:55.190 
you've turned it off so again we plug it
in<00:02:53.760> just<00:02:54.060> to<00:02:54.120> give<00:02:54.240> you<00:02:54.330> one<00:02:54.480> last<00:02:54.660> look<00:02:54.960> and

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:55.200 
in just to give you one last look and

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:57.320 
in just to give you one last look and
then<00:02:55.800> we<00:02:55.950> hold<00:02:56.160> that<00:02:56.280> button<00:02:56.490> in<00:02:56.700> for<00:02:57.090> two

00:02:57.320 --> 00:02:57.330 
then we hold that button in for two

00:02:57.330 --> 00:03:00.910 
then we hold that button in for two
seconds<00:02:57.750> and<00:02:58.130> we<00:02:59.130> can<00:02:59.160> start<00:02:59.730> charging<00:03:00.030> again

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:00.920 
seconds and we can start charging again

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:05.810 
seconds and we can start charging again
let's<00:03:01.920> just<00:03:02.010> try<00:03:02.310> that<00:03:02.460> again<00:03:04.190> here<00:03:05.190> we<00:03:05.370> go<00:03:05.580> and

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:05.820 
let's just try that again here we go and

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:08.630 
let's just try that again here we go and
charging<00:03:06.450> has<00:03:06.660> started<00:03:07.380> so<00:03:07.950> a<00:03:08.010> very<00:03:08.400> nice

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:08.640 
charging has started so a very nice

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:11.420 
charging has started so a very nice
compact<00:03:09.240> device<00:03:09.600> very<00:03:10.020> very<00:03:10.260> useful<00:03:10.530> it's<00:03:11.280> not

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:11.430
