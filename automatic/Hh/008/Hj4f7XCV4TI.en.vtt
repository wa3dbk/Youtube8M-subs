00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
I will do is I will micro it so we will

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:16.250 
I will do is I will micro it so we will
micro<00:01:14.130> this<00:01:14.310> chocolate<00:01:14.640> for<00:01:14.970> around<00:01:15.180> 45<00:01:15.870> to<00:01:15.900> 1

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:16.260 
micro this chocolate for around 45 to 1

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:18.050 
micro this chocolate for around 45 to 1
minute<00:01:16.410> we<00:01:17.100> have<00:01:17.190> to<00:01:17.250> just<00:01:17.490> smell<00:01:17.820> this

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
minute we have to just smell this

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:20.270 
minute we have to just smell this
chocolate<00:01:18.360> and<00:01:18.660> give<00:01:19.320> it<00:01:19.440> some<00:01:19.710> temperature

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
chocolate and give it some temperature

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:26.270 
chocolate and give it some temperature
so<00:01:20.940> I<00:01:21.210> think<00:01:21.510> it's<00:01:21.780> done<00:01:24.530> so<00:01:25.530> this<00:01:25.980> is<00:01:26.040> our

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
so I think it's done so this is our

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:29.930 
so I think it's done so this is our
chocolate<00:01:26.690> you<00:01:27.690> can<00:01:27.870> see<00:01:28.110> in<00:01:28.830> microwave<00:01:29.790> the

chocolate you can see in microwave the
chocolate<00:01:30.270> does<00:01:30.390> not<00:01:30.510> melt<00:01:30.690> very<00:01:31.050> smoothly<00:01:31.590> so

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
chocolate does not melt very smoothly so

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:34.520 
chocolate does not melt very smoothly so
as<00:01:32.430> you<00:01:32.550> can<00:01:32.670> see<00:01:32.880> this<00:01:33.090> melted<00:01:34.050> chocolate<00:01:34.470> is

there just stir it properly so the

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:40.160

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:27.780 
straight to it another science band is

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:29.839 
straight to it another science band is
gelatin<00:02:28.590> free<00:02:28.799> chocolate<00:02:29.219> cheesecake<00:02:29.430> is

00:02:29.839 --> 00:02:29.849 
gelatin free chocolate cheesecake is

00:02:29.849 --> 00:02:32.089 
gelatin free chocolate cheesecake is
what<00:02:30.150> I've<00:02:30.269> done<00:02:30.390> is<00:02:30.569> I<00:02:30.870> have<00:02:31.140> combined<00:02:31.829> the

00:02:32.089 --> 00:02:32.099 
what I've done is I have combined the

00:02:32.099 --> 00:02:36.050 
what I've done is I have combined the
hot<00:02:33.000> chocolate<00:02:33.329> with<00:02:34.079> soft<00:02:34.829> cheese<00:02:35.129> and<00:02:35.370> some

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:36.060 
hot chocolate with soft cheese and some

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:38.750 
hot chocolate with soft cheese and some
condensed<00:02:36.450> milk<00:02:36.659> so<00:02:37.439> the<00:02:37.680> the<00:02:38.250> mixture<00:02:38.459> of

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:38.760 
condensed milk so the the mixture of

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:40.250 
condensed milk so the the mixture of
this<00:02:38.939> well<00:02:39.209> it<00:02:39.329> will<00:02:39.420> be<00:02:39.540> kept<00:02:39.750> on<00:02:39.870> the<00:02:39.989> fridge

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:40.260 
this well it will be kept on the fridge

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:42.649 
this well it will be kept on the fridge
or<00:02:40.560> on<00:02:41.040> the<00:02:41.159> refrigerator<00:02:41.640> it<00:02:42.359> will<00:02:42.510> give<00:02:42.629> a

00:02:42.649 --> 00:02:42.659 
or on the refrigerator it will give a

00:02:42.659 --> 00:02:46.369 
or on the refrigerator it will give a
nice<00:02:43.909> solid<00:02:44.909> mass<00:02:45.150> so<00:02:45.540> the<00:02:45.900> hardness<00:02:46.230> of

00:02:46.369 --> 00:02:46.379 
nice solid mass so the hardness of

00:02:46.379 --> 00:02:48.619 
nice solid mass so the hardness of
chocolate<00:02:46.859> and<00:02:47.040> the<00:02:47.579> cheese<00:02:47.879> which<00:02:48.239> is<00:02:48.269> semi

00:02:48.619 --> 00:02:48.629 
chocolate and the cheese which is semi

00:02:48.629 --> 00:02:50.750 
chocolate and the cheese which is semi
soft<00:02:48.930> and<00:02:49.170> the<00:02:49.530> condensed<00:02:50.099> milk<00:02:50.189> which<00:02:50.730> is

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:50.760 
soft and the condensed milk which is

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:53.170 
soft and the condensed milk which is
also<00:02:51.299> not<00:02:51.599> very<00:02:51.629> thin<00:02:52.109> it's<00:02:52.260> a<00:02:52.379> thick

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:53.180 
also not very thin it's a thick

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:56.509 
also not very thin it's a thick
condensed<00:02:54.180> milk<00:02:54.389> so<00:02:55.049> this<00:02:55.260> mixture<00:02:55.620> is<00:02:56.069> now

00:02:56.509 --> 00:02:56.519 
condensed milk so this mixture is now

00:02:56.519 --> 00:02:58.190 
condensed milk so this mixture is now
ready<00:02:56.549> what<00:02:57.269> you<00:02:57.359> can<00:02:57.540> do<00:02:57.659> is<00:02:57.780> with<00:02:57.930> a<00:02:57.959> bisque

00:04:01.819 --> 00:04:01.829 
butterscotch and also to a stage where

00:04:01.829 --> 00:04:03.289 
butterscotch and also to a stage where
we<00:04:01.949> can<00:04:01.979> make<00:04:02.220> a<00:04:02.280> nice<00:04:02.489> garnish<00:04:02.849> out<00:04:03.150> of<00:04:03.239> the
