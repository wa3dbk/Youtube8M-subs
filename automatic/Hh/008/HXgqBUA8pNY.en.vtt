natural yeast that lives all over our
body<00:02:49.680> but<00:02:50.040> there<00:02:50.280> is<00:02:50.400> a<00:02:50.430> yeast<00:02:50.730> that<00:02:50.819> lives<00:02:50.940> on

body but there is a yeast that lives on
our<00:02:51.390> scalp<00:02:51.690> and<00:02:51.959> so<00:02:52.590> when<00:02:52.890> you<00:02:53.130> are<00:02:53.280> in<00:02:53.459> taking

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:56.190 
too much sugar than sugar feeds yeast

00:02:56.190 --> 00:03:00.410 
too much sugar than sugar feeds yeast

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:00.420 
and women we know yeast we become very

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:02.449 
and women we know yeast we become very
