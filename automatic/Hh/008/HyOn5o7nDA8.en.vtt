00:00:03.680 --> 00:00:09.780
 Hey, guys, I 'm here on the land. 

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:14.370
 east slows down the map that 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:17.070
 stay here in the eastern kingdoms right here and 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:19.590
 I 'm right here at the gate of 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:22.800
 east wall is that it has a dungeon that 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:25.740
 to home but here at the gate of the 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:28.560
 net woman is where the entrance is 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:30.720
 back of the instance and in this video I 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:34.890
 show how to get this mount that is the 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:38.219
 death steed to resell the mount 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:42.300
 has about a 1% chance of falling 

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:44.870
 of the final boss of the dungeon and then let's go 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:44.870
 over there 

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:51.989
 this instance can be done in the 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:52.980
 Normal even just have a way 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:55.440
 normal 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:57.480
 so that means you can do 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:59.430
 the instances and how many times you 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:01.500
 I want the same day 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:03.660
 you just have to take in 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:05.970
 consider that you can only 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:07.520
 visit an instance five times per 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:10.409
 hour 

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:14.520
 this is an easy instance is 

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:17.670
 level 45 plus or minus then any 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:19.500
 player level 80 or higher can 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:23.640
 solar quietly 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:27.330
 you can use your 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:31.560
 invisibility if you have to avoid 

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:33.600
 combat with modes and can also 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:35.790
 should use any effect you have 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:39.180
 speed to make your way 

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:42.299
 faster and then we're going to go 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:46.110
 speed up a little video to be able to go 

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:49.320
 faster and here in this instance 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:51.119
 next you have access to the 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:55.710
 last ball you will have to the first 

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:59.719
 clean the three insureds that are where 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:02:03.719
 are the 3 main bosses of the instance 

00:01:59.719 --> 00:02:05.460
 then you can clear the extras in the 

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:08.220
 order you prefer 

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:12.259
 but you need to kill all the furniture 

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:12.259
 that are inside the gradis 

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:19.120
 so we're going on here killing these 

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:21.460
 trash mobs and here is already the first 

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:25.030
 We surely enter into the 

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:26.800
 insured tim and have to kill all these 

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:29.140
 furniture in here 

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:31.900
 when you kill all these furniture you 

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:34.990
 can see on the chat channel in the game that 

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:39.400
 appears a very red pnj side scream 

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:41.680
 a crystal was dropped then this 

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:47.920
 means they're already clean 

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:50.110
 Now we go to the second and secured and 

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:52.350
 kill all the ways that are there 

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:52.350
 inside 

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:02.920
 You can see that it has appeared one more time. 

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:04.060
 the same final message is everything 

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:07.660
 right 

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:09.550
 so it's just a question of killing the 

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:12.550
 the third mobile safely and 

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:14.580
 gate to the boot will be open here 

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:17.110
 in this part 

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:18.430
 You're locked up for a few seconds. 

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:20.170
 You have to use it from my area to 

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:22.239
 kill the cockroaches 

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:24.100
 if you have any ability to 

00:03:22.239 --> 00:03:26.230
 velocity that increases speed by 

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:28.200
 few seconds you should use 

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:30.700
 Can you pass from that door and you? 

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:32.019
 saves a little time but if you 

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:33.810
 stay locked 

00:03:32.019 --> 00:03:38.350
 No problem, it's just a matter of 

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:44.260
 wait here then the third hold 

00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:46.830
 people are going to kill the bosses and the 

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:46.830
 they are in there 

00:03:47.459 --> 00:03:53.790
 and now you will see a message 

00:03:50.019 --> 00:03:56.709
 different channel in the chat channel that 

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:57.820
 the main base of the forest is 

00:03:56.709 --> 00:04:01.890
 vulnerable 

00:03:57.820 --> 00:04:04.269
 so it's just a matter of coming back now and 

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:06.280
 They entered a gate that is now 

00:04:04.269 --> 00:04:09.400
 open the gate was closed before 

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:11.709
 this gate only opens when the three 

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:14.049
 insured are clean 

00:04:11.709 --> 00:04:17.229
 so if you see this gate closed 

00:04:14.049 --> 00:04:21.160
 go back to the bars and make sure that 

00:04:17.229 --> 00:04:25.090
 all mobs inside are dead 

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:28.390
 You keep x mobs after you kill 

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:31.330
 all these furniture appear boss and 

00:04:28.390 --> 00:04:34.510
 kill him then he will see several mobius 

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:38.410
 you kill them 

00:04:34.510 --> 00:04:41.260
 also and now there's another group of 

00:04:38.410 --> 00:04:45.040
 moby you kill these mobs and now you 

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:49.470
 end door of the boss will be open 

00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:51.910
 then is this boss ac dropa mount 

00:04:49.470 --> 00:04:55.660
 remembering that it has approximately 1% 

00:04:51.910 --> 00:05:00.460
 of chance then it's very rare and we'll see 

00:04:55.660 --> 00:05:03.730
 if a mount falls, it does not fall but everything 

00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:05.920
 well then you can leave the instance 

00:05:03.730 --> 00:05:09.100
 You come back the same way you came. 

00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:12.670
 you leave the instance you can result 

00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:16.240
 instance and try again up to five 

00:05:12.670 --> 00:05:18.430
 times an hour and that's it I hope 

00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:22.470
 You're lucky and I hope you liked it. 

00:05:18.430 --> 00:05:22.470
 video and until the next
