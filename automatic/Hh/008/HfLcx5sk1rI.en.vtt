00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:09.209
 4 k is a new standard defined by 

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:11.360
 the film industry with which 

00:00:09.209 --> 00:00:15.480
 we will have images with a resolution of 

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:18.060
 4096 x 2160 pixels a speed of 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:20.880
 frames of 24 per second and one 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:23.820
 8-bit color depth that's the 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:25.919
 4k from there actual industry 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:27.239
 broad almost television decided 

00:00:25.919 --> 00:00:28.079
 adopt it but with some 

00:00:27.239 --> 00:00:30.539
 modifications 

00:00:28.079 --> 00:00:34.230
 the first is a slight modification of 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:37.530
 the resolution that happens to be 3,860 x 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:39.630
 2160 that way we keep the relationship 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:41.610
 of aspect 16 ninth and we avoid 

00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:44.400
 annoying black stripes too 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:46.950
 we will have a frame rate of 50 or 

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:48.750
 60 and the color depth happens to be 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:51.150
 up to 12 bits with these 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:53.910
 modifications the resulting format what 

00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:56.640
 we call hd 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:59.190
 the advantages of hd video versus 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:02.309
 full hd video are several with the increase 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:04.080
 of resolution we obtain images with a 

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:06.090
 greater clarity so much that we can 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:08.100
 appreciate the hair on the arm or the 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:10.440
 lawn of a football field of a 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:12.840
 surprisingly everything will look more 

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:14.760
 real also with the greatest depth of 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:17.250
 color we won on behalf of 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:19.380
 colors as a direct consequence of 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:20.910
 Increased resolution also increases 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:24.720
 the pixel density of the screens 

00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:26.820
 hd this will allow the user to enjoy 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:28.950
 of these screens at a shorter distance 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:31.560
 of what a screen of 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:33.630
 1080 kate and is that being smaller the 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:35.759
 size of each pixel the human eye is 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:39.240
 unable to distinguish it at a distance 

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:42.000
 minimum concrete all this would be great 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:44.880
 if it were not for the problems that for the 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:47.580
 moment the hd format suffers the most 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:48.930
 important of all is the need to 

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:51.210
 a great bandwidth for your 

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:53.640
 transmission through tdt signal 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:55.229
 current is impossible to do and for 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:58.619
 internet we have the problem of 

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:59.530
 need at least one connection vsl 

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:02.320
 of 3 

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:04.869
 this prevents movie studios and 

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:06.880
 producers can start distributing 

00:02:04.869 --> 00:02:09.670
 the material that they are already generating in 

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:12.160
 said format because another solution would be 

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:14.500
 a physical support but there is no 

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:16.720
 a profitable option for both 

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:19.209
 user as for the creators in the 

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:21.580
 currently a blu-ray disc does not offer 

00:02:19.209 --> 00:02:23.980
 enough capacity to store a 

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:26.650
 movie in 4k because at higher resolution 

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:28.600
 more information and therefore more 

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:31.750
 capacity we will require to save 

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:34.840
 all of that data therefore except 

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:36.820
 of the sony offer with 4k video limit 

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:39.070
 those of amazon and netflix that will produce 

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:41.410
 all his series in 4k and they have already started 

00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:43.260
 to transmit some more some other 

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:46.150
 loose piece that chains like the bbc 

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:48.790
 it emits not much content available 

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:51.190
 the solution to this problem because we have 

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:55.600
 two the first is to trust the 

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:57.940
 advantages that the hvc code oh 12 and 5 is 

00:02:55.600 --> 00:03:00.489
 make it happen as soon as possible and 

00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:03.250
 we can start to have real support in 

00:03:00.489 --> 00:03:05.319
 applications and devices thanks to 

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:07.030
 this compression format 

00:03:05.319 --> 00:03:09.370
 be able to reduce the size of the files 

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:11.829
 4k without quality seeing 

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:13.569
 compromised thus being able to be 

00:03:11.829 --> 00:03:15.819
 transmitted through the internet or 

00:03:13.569 --> 00:03:18.189
 simply improve your storage in 

00:03:15.819 --> 00:03:21.219
 physical supports the second solution 

00:03:18.189 --> 00:03:22.930
 would be to conclude the developments that 

00:03:21.219 --> 00:03:26.379
 manufacturers like pioneer are 

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:30.609
 working they are designing some 

00:03:26.379 --> 00:03:33.849
 blu-ray discs between 256 and 768 

00:03:30.609 --> 00:03:36.400
 gigabyte the positive of the situation 

00:03:33.849 --> 00:03:38.200
 current is that despite a real offer 

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:39.819
 Content that does not exist the 

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:42.040
 TV manufacturers are 

00:03:39.819 --> 00:03:44.439
 betting to attract the attention of the 

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:47.439
 users by the new hd screens 

00:03:44.439 --> 00:03:48.939
 every day we see how the prices go down and 

00:03:47.439 --> 00:03:50.889
 the offer grows with screens of 

00:03:48.939 --> 00:03:53.310
 any diagonal size something that 

00:03:50.889 --> 00:03:56.349
 We are happy because someone must bet 

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:59.139
 Of course it is important that we know that 

00:03:56.349 --> 00:04:01.449
 not all hd screens are equal to 

00:03:59.139 --> 00:04:04.359
 the differences of the panel used if it is 

00:04:01.449 --> 00:04:05.739
 type ene ips its own quality to the 

00:04:04.359 --> 00:04:08.199
 time to represent colors or 

00:04:05.739 --> 00:04:10.750
 viewing angles join the electronics 

00:04:08.199 --> 00:04:14.590
 of the product there are manufacturers that only 

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:16.449
 hdmi 1.4 connections offer us this 

00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:19.030
 version is valid to transmit 

00:04:16.449 --> 00:04:21.039
 hd content but with the limitation of 

00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:23.530
 only be able to do it up to 30 frames per 

00:04:21.039 --> 00:04:26.110
 second something acceptable to watch movies 

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:28.030
 but insufficient for television and 

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:30.669
 is that sporting events or others 

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:33.190
 programs would lose a lot of fluidity if 

00:04:30.669 --> 00:04:35.680
 are not displayed at 50 or 60 frames per 

00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:37.900
 second therefore it is important that 

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:39.669
 count on hdmi 2.0 

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:41.830
 and now it's time for the great 

00:04:39.669 --> 00:04:43.690
 ask knowing that the offer of the 

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:46.389
 content is not as broad as we 

00:04:43.690 --> 00:04:48.430
 I would like the truth is that many 

00:04:46.389 --> 00:04:50.620
 you will ask if it is worth it or not 

00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:52.660
 buy a screen of this type then 

00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:54.850
 well if you are thinking of buying a 

00:04:52.660 --> 00:04:56.889
 high-end television the difference 

00:04:54.850 --> 00:04:59.229
 price is not that big anymore and we'll be 

00:04:56.889 --> 00:05:01.210
 investing in a television that we 

00:04:59.229 --> 00:05:03.699
 prepare for the hd content that will arrive 

00:05:01.210 --> 00:05:05.949
 which is expected to be implanted more 

00:05:03.699 --> 00:05:08.710
 quickly that what we have taken in 

00:05:05.949 --> 00:05:12.669
 do it with the hd even shuffles the 

00:05:08.710 --> 00:05:15.550
 2015 as date and if 90% of your 

00:05:12.669 --> 00:05:18.100
 content is in 1080p the winged rsc that 

00:05:15.550 --> 00:05:20.199
 do these screens will allow us 

00:05:18.100 --> 00:05:22.560
 have a fairly high quality image 

00:05:20.199 --> 00:05:25.180
 we will always have the possibility 

00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:27.520
 of auto generate our own content 

00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:30.550
 or hd with cameras like the one for the sony 

00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:32.830
 gh4 or even with which smartphone 

00:05:30.550 --> 00:05:36.280
 like the galaxy s5 or hesperia z between 

00:05:32.830 --> 00:05:38.530
 others offers us clear that if the 

00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:41.470
 investment is too expensive for us 

00:05:38.530 --> 00:05:44.380
 and 90% of the content that we visualize 

00:05:41.470 --> 00:05:47.410
 it does not even reach 1080p resolution 

00:05:44.380 --> 00:05:49.210
 the answer is a resounding no we are going to 

00:05:47.410 --> 00:05:51.520
 get a lack of sharpness image 

00:05:49.210 --> 00:05:53.590
 blurred and we're not going to take advantage of 

00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:56.290
 maximum quality that these screens are 

00:05:53.590 --> 00:05:58.060
 able to offer so I hope that 

00:05:56.290 --> 00:06:01.120
 with all this and you are a little clear 

00:05:58.060 --> 00:06:04.380
 how is the whole theme of the 4k or the 

00:06:01.120 --> 00:06:04.380
 hd resolution
