00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:45.730 
let's figure out how we're gonna get rid
of<00:00:44.120> them<00:00:44.270> without<00:00:44.480> having<00:00:44.930> any<00:00:45.320> of<00:00:45.470> our

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:45.740

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:49.190 
characters dying so what I'm gonna do is

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:51.700 
characters dying so what I'm gonna do is
I'm<00:00:49.730> gonna<00:00:49.910> move<00:00:50.660> my<00:00:51.020> sniper<00:00:51.350> so<00:00:51.650> I've

where<00:00:55.400> I<00:00:55.430> want<00:00:55.790> them<00:00:55.880> to<00:00:56.030> move<00:00:56.210> and<00:00:56.810> then<00:00:57.050> I'm

00:00:57.100 --> 00:00:57.110 
where I want them to move and then I'm

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:58.300 
where I want them to move and then I'm
gonna<00:00:57.260> have<00:00:57.380> them<00:00:57.500> look<00:00:57.770> in<00:00:57.950> that<00:00:58.130> direction

gonna have them look in that direction

00:00:58.310 --> 00:01:01.660 
gonna have them look in that direction
with<00:00:58.820> a<00:00:58.850> single<00:00:59.240> tap<00:00:59.890> so<00:01:00.890> they<00:01:01.070> go<00:01:01.220> over

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:01.670 
with a single tap so they go over

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:04.590 
with a single tap so they go over
they'll<00:01:02.510> be<00:01:02.630> you<00:01:02.930> know<00:01:03.020> they'll<00:01:03.530> finish<00:01:03.740> their

00:01:04.590 --> 00:01:04.600 
they'll be you know they'll finish their

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:06.970 
they'll be you know they'll finish their
movement<00:01:05.600> facing<00:01:06.440> in<00:01:06.650> that<00:01:06.800> direction

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:06.980 
movement facing in that direction

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:09.970 
movement facing in that direction
towards<00:01:07.520> the<00:01:07.610> SMG<00:01:08.060> now<00:01:08.210> the<00:01:08.270> SMG<00:01:08.780> fires<00:01:09.560> at

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:09.980 
towards the SMG now the SMG fires at

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:12.310 
towards the SMG now the SMG fires at
relatively<00:01:10.880> short<00:01:11.120> range<00:01:11.390> that's<00:01:12.020> where<00:01:12.230> they

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:12.320 
relatively short range that's where they

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:13.540 
relatively short range that's where they
do<00:01:12.380> their<00:01:12.620> maximum<00:01:13.040> damage

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:13.550 
do their maximum damage

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:15.760 
do their maximum damage
so<00:01:14.000> my<00:01:14.600> snipe<00:01:14.840> is<00:01:14.990> going<00:01:15.140> to<00:01:15.200> be<00:01:15.290> out<00:01:15.500> of<00:01:15.650> the

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:15.770 
so my snipe is going to be out of the

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:17.470 
so my snipe is going to be out of the
line<00:01:15.950> of<00:01:15.980> fire<00:01:16.250> which<00:01:16.520> is<00:01:16.700> exactly<00:01:17.270> what<00:01:17.450> I

00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:17.480 
line of fire which is exactly what I

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:20.080 
line of fire which is exactly what I
want<00:01:17.780> I<00:01:18.050> can<00:01:18.500> also<00:01:18.650> select<00:01:18.980> my<00:01:19.490> squad<00:01:19.970> in<00:01:20.060> the

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:20.090 
want I can also select my squad in the

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:21.550 
want I can also select my squad in the
bottom<00:01:20.330> right<00:01:20.420> hand<00:01:20.480> corner<00:01:20.630> so<00:01:21.020> I<00:01:21.080> can<00:01:21.260> tap<00:01:21.530> on

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:21.560 
bottom right hand corner so I can tap on

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:23.940 
bottom right hand corner so I can tap on
the<00:01:21.710> bottom<00:01:22.550> right<00:01:22.760> hand<00:01:22.820> corner<00:01:22.910> like<00:01:23.270> this

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:23.950 
the bottom right hand corner like this

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:27.520 
the bottom right hand corner like this
and<00:01:25.420> I<00:01:26.420> think<00:01:26.720> what<00:01:26.810> I'm<00:01:26.900> gonna<00:01:26.990> do<00:01:27.230> with<00:01:27.380> my

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:27.530 
and I think what I'm gonna do with my

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:31.690 
and I think what I'm gonna do with my
SMG<00:01:28.400> is<00:01:29.530> I'm<00:01:30.530> gonna<00:01:30.710> whip<00:01:31.070> you<00:01:31.280> around<00:01:31.490> here

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:31.700 
SMG is I'm gonna whip you around here

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:34.420 
SMG is I'm gonna whip you around here
DoubleTap<00:01:32.240> to<00:01:32.960> go<00:01:33.110> that<00:01:33.350> way<00:01:33.530> and<00:01:33.860> I'm<00:01:34.070> when<00:01:34.400> I

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:34.430 
DoubleTap to go that way and I'm when I

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:37.510 
DoubleTap to go that way and I'm when I
tap<00:01:34.760> and<00:01:34.880> hold<00:01:34.940> on<00:01:35.270> the<00:01:35.360> screen<00:01:35.690> like<00:01:36.350> so<00:01:36.520> that

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:37.520 
tap and hold on the screen like so that

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:40.990 
tap and hold on the screen like so that
allows<00:01:38.210> them<00:01:38.540> to<00:01:38.890> keep<00:01:39.890> their<00:01:40.220> focus<00:01:40.460> on<00:01:40.850> that

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:41.000 
allows them to keep their focus on that

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:42.550 
allows them to keep their focus on that
direction<00:01:41.480> as<00:01:41.600> they're<00:01:42.020> moving<00:01:42.440> it

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:42.560 
direction as they're moving it

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:45.130 
direction as they're moving it
sacrifices<00:01:43.130> a<00:01:43.159> bit<00:01:43.310> of<00:01:43.370> movement<00:01:43.550> speed<00:01:44.140> but

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:45.140 
sacrifices a bit of movement speed but

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:47.560 
sacrifices a bit of movement speed but
that's<00:01:45.290> okay<00:01:45.790> because<00:01:46.790> it<00:01:47.210> means<00:01:47.390> that

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:47.570 
that's okay because it means that

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:50.890 
that's okay because it means that
they're<00:01:47.690> a<00:01:47.720> little<00:01:47.930> bit<00:01:48.110> more<00:01:48.290> likely<00:01:48.830> to<00:01:49.900> be

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:50.900 
they're a little bit more likely to be

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:53.980 
they're a little bit more likely to be
fine<00:01:51.170> so<00:01:52.070> I'm<00:01:52.159> gonna<00:01:52.280> move<00:01:53.240> my<00:01:53.270> salt<00:01:53.750> over

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:53.990 
fine so I'm gonna move my salt over

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:56.260 
fine so I'm gonna move my salt over
there<00:01:54.110> as<00:01:54.290> well<00:01:54.590> and<00:01:54.860> then<00:01:55.520> my<00:01:55.670> shotgun<00:01:56.240> I

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:56.270 
there as well and then my shotgun I

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:58.630 
there as well and then my shotgun I
think<00:01:56.510> I'm<00:01:56.600> gonna<00:01:56.720> keep<00:01:57.170> them<00:01:57.440> there<00:01:57.710> so<00:01:58.460> now<00:01:58.610> I

00:01:58.630 --> 00:01:58.640 
think I'm gonna keep them there so now I

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:02.080 
think I'm gonna keep them there so now I
think<00:01:58.790> what<00:01:59.090> I'm<00:01:59.180> gonna<00:01:59.299> do<00:01:59.570> is<00:01:59.860> execute<00:02:01.090> let's

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:02.090 
think what I'm gonna do is execute let's

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:04.350 
think what I'm gonna do is execute let's
see<00:02:02.270> what<00:02:02.390> happens

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:04.360 
see what happens

00:02:17.239 --> 00:02:18.910 
my next phase so I need to take take out
the<00:02:17.360> sniper<00:02:17.689> who<00:02:18.079> is<00:02:18.230> going<00:02:18.379> to<00:02:18.439> be<00:02:18.709> able<00:02:18.799> to

question mark button we can bring up
information<00:03:09.920> about<00:03:10.099> them<00:03:10.189> so<00:03:10.310> I've<00:03:10.400> got<00:03:10.519> my

flash grenades and frags
so<00:03:15.739> I<00:03:15.769> think<00:03:15.889> what<00:03:16.099> I'm<00:03:16.189> gonna<00:03:16.280> do<00:03:16.519> is<00:03:16.909> grab<00:03:17.780> my

so I think what I'm gonna do is grab my
SMG<00:03:20.150> person<00:03:20.569> is<00:03:20.720> gonna<00:03:20.930> throw<00:03:21.139> down<00:03:21.379> a<00:03:22.299> smoke

00:03:23.289 --> 00:03:23.299 
SMG person is gonna throw down a smoke

00:03:23.299 --> 00:03:30.039 
SMG person is gonna throw down a smoke
grenade<00:03:25.060> over<00:03:26.060> in<00:03:26.480> this<00:03:27.349> direction<00:03:27.410> ah<00:03:28.900> no<00:03:29.900> it

will hit there okay let's undo that undo
that<00:03:32.540> move<00:03:32.780> so<00:03:33.440> I<00:03:33.470> think<00:03:33.590> I'm<00:03:33.799> gonna<00:03:33.889> get<00:03:34.040> the

00:03:34.149 --> 00:03:34.159

that move so I think I'm gonna get the
SMG<00:03:34.549> person<00:03:34.940> to<00:03:35.060> move<00:03:35.209> over<00:03:35.480> there<00:03:36.909> then<00:03:37.909> throw

00:03:38.319 --> 00:03:38.329 
SMG person to move over there then throw

00:03:38.329 --> 00:03:49.089 
SMG person to move over there then throw
down<00:03:38.599> a<00:03:41.139> smoke<00:03:42.280> and<00:03:44.139> then<00:03:45.139> we'll<00:03:45.349> execute<00:03:45.739> that

00:03:49.089 --> 00:03:49.099 

00:03:49.099 --> 00:03:51.789 

so<00:03:49.790> they've<00:03:50.180> throwed<00:03:50.780> out<00:03:50.989> thrown<00:03:51.379> that<00:03:51.530> down

00:03:51.789 --> 00:03:51.799 
so they've throwed out thrown that down

00:03:51.799 --> 00:03:54.280 
so they've throwed out thrown that down
we've<00:03:52.430> also<00:03:52.609> taken<00:03:52.909> one<00:03:53.629> person<00:03:54.019> out<00:03:54.139> we've

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:54.290

00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:56.920 
we've also taken one person out we've
got<00:03:54.439> my<00:03:54.560> shotgun<00:03:54.859> person<00:03:55.459> right<00:03:56.420> by<00:03:56.689> their

got my shotgun person right by their

00:03:56.930 --> 00:03:59.530 
got my shotgun person right by their
look<00:03:57.139> I<00:03:57.609> think<00:03:58.609> what<00:03:58.760> we<00:03:58.849> might<00:03:59.060> end<00:03:59.239> up<00:03:59.359> doing

00:03:59.530 --> 00:03:59.540 
look I think what we might end up doing

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:02.830 
look I think what we might end up doing
is<00:03:59.889> whipping<00:04:00.889> around<00:04:00.980> here<00:04:01.659> keeping<00:04:02.659> a

00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:02.840 
is whipping around here keeping a

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:05.289 
is whipping around here keeping a
concentration<00:04:03.530> this<00:04:03.889> way<00:04:04.099> taking<00:04:04.879> out<00:04:05.120> that

00:04:05.289 --> 00:04:05.299 
concentration this way taking out that

00:04:05.299 --> 00:04:09.009 
concentration this way taking out that
sniper<00:04:05.739> I'm<00:04:06.739> gonna<00:04:06.920> now<00:04:07.129> move<00:04:07.489> my<00:04:07.790> own<00:04:08.359> sniper

00:04:09.009 --> 00:04:09.019 
sniper I'm gonna now move my own sniper

00:04:09.019 --> 00:04:13.929 
sniper I'm gonna now move my own sniper
into<00:04:10.870> better<00:04:11.870> position<00:04:12.469> possibly<00:04:13.370> just<00:04:13.670> here

00:04:13.929 --> 00:04:13.939 
into better position possibly just here

00:04:13.939 --> 00:04:16.599 
into better position possibly just here
facing<00:04:14.689> this<00:04:14.989> direction<00:04:15.250> but<00:04:16.250> because<00:04:16.489> we've

00:04:16.599 --> 00:04:16.609 
facing this direction but because we've

00:04:16.609 --> 00:04:18.219 
facing this direction but because we've
thrown<00:04:16.820> smoke<00:04:17.090> down<00:04:17.509> I'm<00:04:17.750> going<00:04:17.900> to<00:04:17.930> take<00:04:18.109> my

00:04:18.219 --> 00:04:18.229 
thrown smoke down I'm going to take my

00:04:18.229 --> 00:04:20.349 
thrown smoke down I'm going to take my
assaults<00:04:18.739> and<00:04:19.280> move<00:04:19.489> them<00:04:19.639> into<00:04:19.849> that<00:04:20.120> and

00:04:20.349 --> 00:04:20.359 
assaults and move them into that and

00:04:20.359 --> 00:04:23.439 
assaults and move them into that and
have<00:04:21.169> them<00:04:21.259> pointing<00:04:21.650> in<00:04:21.739> this<00:04:21.799> direction<00:04:22.449> and

00:04:23.439 --> 00:04:23.449 
have them pointing in this direction and

00:04:23.449 --> 00:04:26.020 
have them pointing in this direction and
