as opposed to dance or pairs it's so

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:18.260 
as opposed to dance or pairs it's so
much<00:00:16.500> more<00:00:16.740> difficult<00:00:17.369> to<00:00:17.520> create<00:00:17.699> a<00:00:17.910> dynamic

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:18.270 
much more difficult to create a dynamic

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:21.050 
much more difficult to create a dynamic
mood<00:00:18.960> and<00:00:19.260> be<00:00:19.400> commanding<00:00:20.400> when<00:00:20.910> you're

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:24.740 

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:27.050 

that's<00:00:25.740> good<00:00:25.920> point<00:00:26.130> Jojo<00:00:26.490> you<00:00:26.640> don't<00:00:26.849> have

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:27.060 
that's good point Jojo you don't have

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:28.700 
that's good point Jojo you don't have
that<00:00:27.210> other<00:00:27.359> body<00:00:27.660> with<00:00:27.990> which<00:00:28.140> you<00:00:28.320> relate<00:00:28.650> to

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:28.710 
that other body with which you relate to

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:31.880 
that other body with which you relate to
it<00:00:28.980> is<00:00:29.640> really<00:00:29.849> fuel<00:00:30.720> and<00:00:31.260> perhaps<00:00:31.650> the

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:31.890 
it is really fuel and perhaps the

00:00:31.890 --> 00:01:10.530 
it is really fuel and perhaps the
audience

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:10.540 

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:16.350 

so<00:01:11.540> how<00:01:11.930> will<00:01:12.289> teens<00:01:12.680> evolve<00:01:13.520> I<00:01:14.950> assume<00:01:15.950> most

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:16.360 
so how will teens evolve I assume most

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:19.090 
so how will teens evolve I assume most
are<00:01:17.360> through<00:01:17.630> very<00:01:17.840> careful<00:01:18.320> coordination<00:01:18.680> of

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:19.100 
are through very careful coordination of

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:20.859 
are through very careful coordination of
moving<00:01:19.460> but<00:01:19.670> do<00:01:20.090> they<00:01:20.180> ever<00:01:20.210> come<00:01:20.509> about<00:01:20.689> by

00:01:20.859 --> 00:01:20.869 
moving but do they ever come about by

00:01:20.869 --> 00:01:25.389 
moving but do they ever come about by
accident<00:01:22.179> sometimes<00:01:23.179> they<00:01:23.479> do<00:01:23.539> but<00:01:23.899> I<00:01:24.399> think

00:01:25.389 --> 00:01:25.399 
accident sometimes they do but I think

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:28.240 
accident sometimes they do but I think
often<00:01:25.610> a<00:01:26.030> skater<00:01:26.509> will<00:01:26.780> pick<00:01:27.500> the<00:01:27.679> music<00:01:28.130> that

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:28.250 
often a skater will pick the music that

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:29.740 
often a skater will pick the music that
they<00:01:28.429> can<00:01:28.640> really<00:01:28.970> relate<00:01:29.240> news<00:01:29.479> and<00:01:29.659> get

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:29.750 
they can really relate news and get

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:33.070 
they can really relate news and get
excited<00:01:30.170> about<00:01:30.789> then<00:01:31.789> they<00:01:32.000> pick<00:01:32.659> their<00:01:32.869> most

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:33.080 
excited about then they pick their most

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:35.139 
excited about then they pick their most
difficult<00:01:33.319> elements<00:01:34.310> and<00:01:34.490> I'll<00:01:34.850> probably

00:01:35.139 --> 00:01:35.149 
difficult elements and I'll probably

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:36.789 
difficult elements and I'll probably
want<00:01:35.569> to<00:01:35.659> get<00:01:35.780> them<00:01:35.959> out<00:01:36.110> of<00:01:36.140> play<00:01:36.380> right<00:01:36.560> at

00:01:36.789 --> 00:01:36.799 
want to get them out of play right at

00:01:36.799 --> 00:01:39.100 
want to get them out of play right at
the<00:01:36.890> top<00:01:37.130> of<00:01:37.310> the<00:01:37.369> number<00:01:37.759> and<00:01:38.000> then<00:01:38.929> they'll

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:39.110 
the top of the number and then they'll

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:41.050
