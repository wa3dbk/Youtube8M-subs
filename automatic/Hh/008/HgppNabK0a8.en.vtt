00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:02.210
 ladies and gentlemen 

00:00:02.210 --> 00:00:06.930
 There are a lot of indicators out there regarding who will win these elections 

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:12.120
 If you are liberal and the executor is apparently sober several sober 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:16.280
 Is your man according to the center of the right wing who was uh ... attacking Nate 

00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:17.910
 The seller for 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:22.660
 I do not know how he talks the way he dresses and the fact that he does not now 

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:26.410
 Oh ... He expected some 70 percent of President Obama's chance 

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:28.339
 Maybe win a little more 

00:00:28.339 --> 00:00:33.090
 They differ on a day-to-day basis that he combines the method Paul averages to 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:34.630
 Different polls uh ... 

00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:36.010
 exactly like 

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:37.410
 Polls do it 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:41.360
 They are constantly waiting for different factors such as having more of an effect 

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:42.360
 others 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:46.100
 Some people go for a sports trade that seems to me to be ridiculous I know that 

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:47.180
 if I were 

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:50.770
 It was millions of dollars and wanted to make it look like uh ... and was my candidate 

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:55.230
 I win I think I'll just buy a bunch of deaths 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:56.810
 For this purpose, however 

00:00:56.810 --> 00:01:00.570
 However I have my own 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:05.420
 A measure of President Obama's chances of winning 

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:07.030
 One that is not 

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:09.240
 Smooth or feat 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:13.650
 One that is not in any way shaved by people placing bets 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:16.800
 His name is Chris Christie 

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:21.820
 Wah ... all you have to do is basically 

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:27.910
 It's kind of like it's uh ... when a mother ... a rat comes from him 

00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:29.800
 Seeing the shadow is one of those things 

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:32.950
 What you do is involve cookies and that's all I'm going to say 

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:38.120
 But then wait and see what Chris Christie says in 

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:40.900
 After the emergency 

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:44.860
 Oh ... Chris Christie has come from and has been commended for President Obama 

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:47.320
 Response 

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:53.659
 For in this uh ... Hurricane for this ... disaster on the east coast 

00:01:53.659 --> 00:01:57.650
 He went on the Fox News Network as well as to the comet yesterday present three times 

00:01:57.650 --> 00:02:00.590
 For the last time in the middle of last night he asks what he can do 

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:04.270
 He told me if you could speed up the taxpayer etc New Jersey is a major disaster area that 

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:06.209
 That would help us to federal money 

00:02:06.209 --> 00:02:09.069
 And resources here as soon as possible to help clean up the damage 

00:02:09.069 --> 00:02:11.669
 Here 

00:02:11.669 --> 00:02:15.669
 And on the allies of the fox with ... disease 

00:02:15.669 --> 00:02:16.719
 She said no 

00:02:16.719 --> 00:02:23.499
 But asked him but but what about MIT Romney Mitt Romney would work the next visit 

00:02:23.499 --> 00:02:26.969
 Chris Christie says I have no idea whether or not he nor I was 

00:02:26.969 --> 00:02:29.949
 Rent a bit of concern or ensure an interested entry 

00:02:29.949 --> 00:02:33.410
 Get a job done here in New Jersey It's much bigger than presidential policy 

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:35.949
 I could care less about any of those things 

00:02:35.949 --> 00:02:39.129
 Architecture where 

00:02:39.129 --> 00:02:41.379
 If there is bone 

00:02:41.379 --> 00:02:45.180
 Now it's inside NATO Chris Christie that the stock at MIT was Romney 

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:47.009
 Will become the next president 

00:02:47.009 --> 00:02:50.379
 He will sing very different 

00:02:50.379 --> 00:02:53.269
 So Chris Christie 

00:02:53.269 --> 00:02:58.089
 In addition to uh ... in this case has a broken wall clock 

00:02:58.089 --> 00:03:00.049
 He does the right thing 

00:03:00.049 --> 00:03:03.349
 Praising President Obama 

00:03:03.349 --> 00:03:07.429
 Being in front of this calamity I am sure the president 

00:03:07.429 --> 00:03:10.449
 Obama was to identify 

00:03:10.449 --> 00:03:15.129
 Because they are aware of the political effects of the state 

00:03:15.129 --> 00:03:19.369
 But still it works the right thing 

00:03:19.369 --> 00:03:23.589
 Chris Christie said basically I think this race is over 

00:03:23.589 --> 00:03:25.919
 I do not think there is a chance for MIT Romney is going to participate in 

00:03:25.919 --> 00:03:27.589
 Republican politics 

00:03:27.589 --> 00:03:29.329
 Effective November 7 

00:03:29.329 --> 00:03:34.699
 Wah ... I runnin in cell 1620 

00:03:34.699 --> 00:03:35.849
 Take it 

00:03:35.849 --> 00:03:36.639
 Steve do shit
