00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:57.230
 for 5 to 6 minutes 

00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:59.650
 meanwhile I'm taking a little 

00:02:57.230 --> 00:02:59.650
 pan 

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:06.520
 I deposit golden grapes in the 

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:15.070
 pan 

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:15.070
 as well as honey and cinnamon 

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:22.160
 I add water once again 

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:24.200
 we put the water up we will bring 

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:27.280
 to boiling and then we will close the 

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:33.290
 fire we will let the grapes inflated 

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:38.500
 so I take out the chicken from the fake name on 

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:38.500
 take mergers and cut them in half 

00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:54.390
 and made the chicken into pieces 

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:54.390
 like cubes so in 4 

00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:11.670
 you can immediately add the chicken 

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:11.670
 merguez in the broth 

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:22.540
 as well as zucchini and peas 

00:04:20.510 --> 00:04:22.540
 chick 

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:40.620
 during this time I'm going to inflate 

00:04:38.699 --> 00:04:51.479
 my couscous game but first a little 

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:54.000
 of olive oil on it I mix I 

00:04:51.479 --> 00:04:57.330
 put some salt and a little bit of 

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:59.599
 hair and we can pour boiling water 

00:04:57.330 --> 00:04:59.599
 above 

00:05:02.810 --> 00:05:05.710
 for 

00:05:10.910 --> 00:05:14.600
 just a little bit higher than the 

00:05:12.890 --> 00:05:16.520
 couscous but not too much they are 

00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:25.550
 well impregnated with water I cover it with a 

00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:28.270
 plastic wrap and we'll let it 

00:05:25.550 --> 00:05:30.590
 inflate for at least five minutes 

00:05:28.270 --> 00:05:34.180
 the golden grapes are well inflated 

00:05:30.590 --> 00:05:34.180
 they are removed from the water 

00:05:45.550 --> 00:05:53.380
 that's five minutes my couscous 

00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:55.570
 is inflating I withdraw the 

00:05:53.380 --> 00:05:58.570
 film and here we go the sandstone is 

00:05:55.570 --> 00:06:01.320
 so we'll mix it gently for 

00:05:58.570 --> 00:06:01.320
 give it lightness 

00:06:05.250 --> 00:06:11.920
 now we will be able to serve the 

00:06:08.200 --> 00:06:14.580
 couscous I start by taking some 

00:06:11.920 --> 00:06:14.580
 vegetables and meat 

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:35.950
 I add a little broth over 

00:06:41.300 --> 00:06:44.740
 I take boiling in a small 

00:06:42.590 --> 00:06:44.740
 bowl 

00:06:51.650 --> 00:07:02.360
 I add harissa sauce and I 

00:06:56.780 --> 00:07:03.470
 mix as it should be it will be a 

00:07:02.360 --> 00:07:05.270
 little thing that we will serve in 

00:07:03.470 --> 00:07:09.380
 accompaniment for those who wish 

00:07:05.270 --> 00:07:12.680
 have a couscous a little more raised and 

00:07:09.380 --> 00:07:15.919
 we can sprinkle some grapes on the 

00:07:12.680 --> 00:07:16.490
 couscous and that's it's ready for the 

00:07:15.919 --> 00:07:19.060
 tasting 

00:07:16.490 --> 00:07:19.060
 Enjoy your meal
