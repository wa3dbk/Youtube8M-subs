 Today's learning shareholders will work on dividing the partitions of the hard disk. 

00:00:26.999 --> 00:00:34.760

 Once you've got your first two methods are named after pressing the start line value 

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:41.910
 There's a computer. 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:48.510
 This is not a luck, right click 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:55.620

 Giving the amount of storage at the bottom of the compass management 

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:16.430
 Cloudy with a storage disk management right we enter the soldering hard disk partition 

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:23.850
 Eunikka been pressing Casker management declared a genius, it shows the exceptional status 

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:25.260
 usb memory is one drive f and then three drives here 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:29.250
 Consists of 

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:35.090
 So the kid want to give us a briefing paper 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:37.950
 The original c drive space is not like bell anymore. 

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:43.020
 1024 megabytes 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:46.680
 Sally will understand that 1 GB will be up to here 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:53.310
 3009 Just 3009 people 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:02:01.290
 Here are 73 leagues like this , the size of religion came across the whole c drive 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:02:04.470
 But, among them, organic calculations, the calculation is just about the query, 

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:10.079
 Four times as tall tank 

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:13.079
 There are 4 100 gigs on drive c already by another pate or program 

00:02:10.079 --> 00:02:18.329
 I understand that information is being used. 

00:02:13.079 --> 00:02:22.829
 There are other data in addition to the occupancy forgot to tell the other kids occupied 

00:02:18.329 --> 00:02:29.010
 I do not see how that space is a unit that can not be moved. 

00:02:22.829 --> 00:02:34.050
 However, in this whole space, 

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:41.400
 I'm talking motivation to make another drive will bring tentacles 

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:47.550
 When you press this key, the key will move to the corresponding part of the space 

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:54.260
 Now you can cut down on that space . 

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:54.260
