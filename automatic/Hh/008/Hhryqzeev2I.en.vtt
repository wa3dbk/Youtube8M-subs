00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:39.280 
trail this will show you how the traps

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:41.009 
trail this will show you how the traps
are<00:02:39.489> all<00:02:39.639> situated<00:02:40.209> this<00:02:40.450> is<00:02:40.599> a<00:02:40.719> double

00:02:41.009 --> 00:02:41.019 
are all situated this is a double

00:02:41.019 --> 00:02:42.959 
are all situated this is a double
mechanism<00:02:41.590> you've<00:02:42.129> got<00:02:42.280> a<00:02:42.310> support<00:02:42.730> point

00:02:42.959 --> 00:02:42.969 
mechanism you've got a support point

00:02:42.969 --> 00:02:45.509 
mechanism you've got a support point
here<00:02:43.329> support<00:02:44.019> point<00:02:44.290> here<00:02:44.650> that's<00:02:45.129> four

00:02:45.509 --> 00:02:45.519 
here support point here that's four

00:02:45.519 --> 00:02:48.119 
here support point here that's four
point<00:02:45.819> there<00:02:46.090> just<00:02:46.120> very<00:02:46.599> simple<00:02:47.049> very<00:02:47.980> easy

00:02:48.119 --> 00:02:48.129 
point there just very simple very easy

00:02:48.129 --> 00:02:51.660 
point there just very simple very easy
to<00:02:48.519> operate<00:02:48.730> in<00:02:49.480> the<00:02:49.629> set<00:02:49.900> and<00:02:50.889> will<00:02:51.310> come<00:02:51.489> with

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:51.670 
to operate in the set and will come with

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:56.580 
to operate in the set and will come with
fires<00:02:52.510> and<00:02:52.840> pitches<00:02:53.170> the<00:02:53.290> animal<00:02:55.590> this

00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:56.590 
fires and pitches the animal this

00:02:56.590 --> 00:03:00.119 
fires and pitches the animal this
trapped<00:02:56.859> here<00:02:57.329> is<00:02:58.329> my<00:02:58.689> double<00:02:59.560> kick<00:02:59.739> strap

00:03:00.119 --> 00:03:00.129 
trapped here is my double kick strap

00:03:00.129 --> 00:03:02.879 
trapped here is my double kick strap
it's<00:03:00.909> just<00:03:01.150> a<00:03:01.269> single<00:03:01.629> mechanism<00:03:01.840> to<00:03:02.500> set<00:03:02.739> this

00:03:02.879 --> 00:03:02.889 
it's just a single mechanism to set this

00:03:02.889 --> 00:03:05.129 
it's just a single mechanism to set this
trap<00:03:03.099> you<00:03:03.370> just<00:03:03.579> pick<00:03:03.730> the<00:03:03.760> door<00:03:04.090> up<00:03:04.239> push<00:03:05.109> the

00:03:05.129 --> 00:03:05.139 
trap you just pick the door up push the

00:03:05.139 --> 00:03:08.159 
trap you just pick the door up push the
mechanism<00:03:05.889> forward<00:03:06.250> it's<00:03:06.459> that<00:03:06.810> the<00:03:07.810> animal

00:03:08.159 --> 00:03:08.169 
mechanism forward it's that the animal

00:03:08.169 --> 00:03:10.229 
mechanism forward it's that the animal
comes<00:03:08.379> in<00:03:08.590> he<00:03:08.739> hits<00:03:08.889> the<00:03:08.980> trigger<00:03:09.189> way<00:03:09.400> he

00:03:10.229 --> 00:03:10.239 
comes in he hits the trigger way he

00:03:10.239 --> 00:03:13.440 
comes in he hits the trigger way he
fires<00:03:11.400> what's<00:03:12.400> so<00:03:12.519> good<00:03:12.669> about<00:03:12.730> these<00:03:13.090> traps

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:13.450 
fires what's so good about these traps

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:16.220 
fires what's so good about these traps
or<00:03:13.750> you<00:03:13.930> can<00:03:14.079> take<00:03:14.260> and<00:03:14.950> replace<00:03:15.129> your<00:03:15.579> Springs

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:16.230 
or you can take and replace your Springs

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:18.869 
or you can take and replace your Springs
you<00:03:17.230> want<00:03:17.409> to<00:03:17.469> replace<00:03:17.769> them<00:03:17.980> you<00:03:18.189> want<00:03:18.819> to

00:03:18.869 --> 00:03:18.879 
you want to replace them you want to

00:03:18.879 --> 00:03:21.000 
you want to replace them you want to
take<00:03:19.030> the<00:03:19.150> mechanism<00:03:19.689> off<00:03:19.840> if<00:03:20.590> you<00:03:20.739> want<00:03:20.919> to

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:21.010 
take the mechanism off if you want to

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:22.679 
take the mechanism off if you want to
replace<00:03:21.459> the<00:03:21.519> trigger<00:03:21.939> wires<00:03:22.209> for<00:03:22.480> whatever

00:03:22.679 --> 00:03:22.689 
replace the trigger wires for whatever

00:03:22.689 --> 00:03:24.599
