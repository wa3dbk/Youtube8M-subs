00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:26.920 
so and then we're just going to let that

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:29.070 
so and then we're just going to let that
simmer<00:02:27.310> like<00:02:27.700> I<00:02:27.820> said<00:02:28.000> for<00:02:28.150> one<00:02:28.360> hour<00:02:28.510> and<00:02:28.870> then

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:29.080 
simmer like I said for one hour and then

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:44.210 
simmer like I said for one hour and then
I<00:02:29.140> will<00:02:29.470> come<00:02:29.620> back

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:44.220 

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:46.910 

okay<00:02:45.000> well<00:02:45.180> now<00:02:45.330> we've<00:02:45.540> boiled<00:02:46.350> that<00:02:46.620> for<00:02:46.830> an

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:46.920

what<00:05:07.770> we're<00:05:07.949> gonna<00:05:08.070> do<00:05:08.310> is<00:05:08.490> let<00:05:08.669> that<00:05:08.699> sit<00:05:09.320> 20

00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:10.320 
what we're gonna do is let that sit 20

00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:12.140 
what we're gonna do is let that sit 20
minutes<00:05:10.650> on<00:05:10.949> a<00:05:11.009> low<00:05:11.159> boil<00:05:11.639> then<00:05:11.880> when<00:05:12.000> there's

00:05:12.140 --> 00:05:12.150 
minutes on a low boil then when there's

00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:13.520 
minutes on a low boil then when there's
sugar<00:05:12.300> in<00:05:12.479> this<00:05:12.630> you<00:05:12.780> gotta<00:05:12.930> watch<00:05:13.110> it<00:05:13.139> so<00:05:13.409> it

00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:13.530 
sugar in this you gotta watch it so it

00:05:13.530 --> 00:05:15.980 
sugar in this you gotta watch it so it
doesn't<00:05:13.710> boil<00:05:13.949> over<00:05:14.570> okay<00:05:15.570> so<00:05:15.659> you<00:05:15.810> can<00:05:15.960> see

00:05:15.980 --> 00:05:15.990 
doesn't boil over okay so you can see

00:05:15.990 --> 00:05:18.920 
doesn't boil over okay so you can see
now<00:05:16.289> we've<00:05:16.470> got<00:05:16.650> enough<00:05:16.830> to<00:05:16.979> a<00:05:17.009> boil<00:05:17.370> now<00:05:17.930> when

00:05:18.920 --> 00:05:18.930 
now we've got enough to a boil now when

00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:20.420 
now we've got enough to a boil now when
you're<00:05:19.080> doing<00:05:19.229> this<00:05:19.380> it's<00:05:19.590> this<00:05:19.770> 20<00:05:20.130> minutes

00:05:20.420 --> 00:05:20.430 
you're doing this it's this 20 minutes

00:05:20.430 --> 00:05:22.640 
you're doing this it's this 20 minutes
and<00:05:20.610> that's<00:05:20.759> the<00:05:20.909> time<00:05:21.180> frame<00:05:21.479> it<00:05:21.840> that<00:05:22.470> the

00:05:22.640 --> 00:05:22.650 
and that's the time frame it that the

00:05:22.650 --> 00:05:24.860 
and that's the time frame it that the
actual<00:05:23.099> recipe<00:05:23.280> says<00:05:23.789> but<00:05:24.479> if<00:05:24.599> you've<00:05:24.720> ever

00:05:24.860 --> 00:05:24.870 
actual recipe says but if you've ever

00:05:24.870 --> 00:05:29.210 
actual recipe says but if you've ever
done<00:05:25.610> maple<00:05:26.610> syrup<00:05:27.560> with<00:05:28.560> maple<00:05:28.710> syrup<00:05:28.889> you

00:05:29.210 --> 00:05:29.220 
done maple syrup with maple syrup you

00:05:29.220 --> 00:05:30.439 
done maple syrup with maple syrup you
have<00:05:29.310> to<00:05:29.400> boil<00:05:29.610> it<00:05:29.759> down<00:05:29.789> and<00:05:29.940> boil<00:05:30.300> it<00:05:30.389> down

00:05:30.439 --> 00:05:30.449 
have to boil it down and boil it down

00:05:30.449 --> 00:05:31.610 
have to boil it down and boil it down
and<00:05:30.720> you're<00:05:30.810> trying<00:05:31.020> to<00:05:31.050> get<00:05:31.199> to<00:05:31.259> a<00:05:31.380> certain

00:05:31.610 --> 00:05:31.620 
and you're trying to get to a certain

00:05:31.620 --> 00:05:32.990 
and you're trying to get to a certain
temperature<00:05:32.130> with<00:05:32.400> this<00:05:32.550> you're<00:05:32.729> trying<00:05:32.849> to

00:05:32.990 --> 00:05:33.000 
temperature with this you're trying to

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:35.149 
temperature with this you're trying to
get<00:05:33.120> to<00:05:33.240> a<00:05:33.270> certain<00:05:33.479> consistency<00:05:34.159> because

00:05:35.149 --> 00:05:35.159 
get to a certain consistency because

00:05:35.159 --> 00:05:36.770 
get to a certain consistency because
just<00:05:35.370> by<00:05:35.490> putting<00:05:35.699> rotted<00:05:36.090> enough<00:05:36.389> to<00:05:36.509> cover

00:05:36.770 --> 00:05:36.780 
just by putting rotted enough to cover

water<00:05:42.030> so<00:05:42.360> we're<00:05:42.449> gonna<00:05:42.599> get<00:05:42.690> this<00:05:42.870> down<00:05:43.080> so

00:05:43.279 --> 00:05:43.289 
water so we're gonna get this down so

00:05:43.289 --> 00:05:45.860 
water so we're gonna get this down so
it's<00:05:43.409> gonna<00:05:43.530> be<00:05:43.680> like<00:05:43.860> honey<00:05:44.159> almost<00:05:45.090> maybe<00:05:45.750> a

00:05:45.860 --> 00:05:45.870 
it's gonna be like honey almost maybe a

00:05:45.870 --> 00:05:47.450 
it's gonna be like honey almost maybe a
little<00:05:46.110> bit<00:05:46.259> runny<00:05:46.440> or<00:05:46.530> than<00:05:46.770> honey<00:05:46.949> but<00:05:47.190> very

about<00:06:06.819> almost<00:06:07.810> 40<00:06:08.469> minutes<00:06:08.800> because<00:06:09.099> there

00:06:09.659 --> 00:06:09.669 
about almost 40 minutes because there

about almost 40 minutes because there
was<00:06:09.759> quite<00:06:09.939> a<00:06:10.000> bit<00:06:10.120> of<00:06:10.150> liquid<00:06:10.330> in<00:06:10.479> there<00:06:10.689> now

00:06:11.640 --> 00:06:11.650 
was quite a bit of liquid in there now

00:06:11.650 --> 00:06:13.230 
was quite a bit of liquid in there now

00:06:14.610 --> 00:06:14.620 
the bubbles actually start to get

00:06:14.620 --> 00:06:17.249 
the bubbles actually start to get
heavier<00:06:14.979> almost<00:06:15.550> like<00:06:15.669> they<00:06:15.819> have<00:06:15.969> a<00:06:16.050> sugar<00:06:17.050> in
