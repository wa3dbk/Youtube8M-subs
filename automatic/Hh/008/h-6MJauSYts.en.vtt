00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:43.819 
players well I mean just if it
specifically<00:01:40.710> a<00:01:41.810> an<00:01:42.810> online<00:01:43.290> cash<00:01:43.530> player

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:43.829 
specifically a an online cash player

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:47.630 
specifically a an online cash player
which<00:01:44.220> is<00:01:44.340> like<00:01:44.490> all<00:01:44.790> I<00:01:44.939> do<00:01:45.149> pretty<00:01:45.840> much<00:01:46.640> just

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 
which is like all I do pretty much just

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:49.310 
which is like all I do pretty much just
because<00:01:47.939> you're<00:01:48.060> pulling<00:01:48.299> so<00:01:48.630> so<00:01:48.899> many<00:01:49.079> hands

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:49.320 
because you're pulling so so many hands

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:52.340 
because you're pulling so so many hands
and<00:01:49.799> you're<00:01:50.189> so<00:01:50.520> deep<00:01:50.759> it's<00:01:51.119> like<00:01:51.350> ridiculous

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350 
and you're so deep it's like ridiculous

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:53.810 
and you're so deep it's like ridiculous
so<00:01:52.770> you<00:01:52.829> really<00:01:53.280> have<00:01:53.310> to<00:01:53.430> know<00:01:53.460> how<00:01:53.610> to<00:01:53.640> play

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:53.820
