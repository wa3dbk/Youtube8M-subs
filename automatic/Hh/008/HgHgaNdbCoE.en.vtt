and basically the way I came up with the
idea<00:01:17.430> was<00:01:18.060> I<00:01:18.299> took<00:01:18.360> what<00:01:18.869> I<00:01:18.900> found<00:01:19.170> in<00:01:19.409> Japan<00:01:19.560> I

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
idea was I took what I found in Japan I

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:22.190 
idea was I took what I found in Japan I
made<00:01:20.670> it<00:01:20.700> better<00:01:21.000> as<00:01:21.450> far<00:01:21.659> as<00:01:21.780> the<00:01:21.960> numeral

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
made it better as far as the numeral

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:23.749 
made it better as far as the numeral
done<00:01:22.380> that<00:01:22.590> it<00:01:22.710> stick<00:01:23.070> better<00:01:23.280> so<00:01:23.580> it<00:01:23.640> would

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:23.759 
done that it stick better so it would

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:26.929 
done that it stick better so it would
fall<00:01:24.000> apart<00:01:24.270> and<00:01:24.540> being<00:01:25.470> that<00:01:25.710> I<00:01:25.740> am<00:01:25.860> from<00:01:26.369> Los
