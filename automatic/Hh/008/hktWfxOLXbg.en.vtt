00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:10.240 
our first legato sequence from the which

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:11.910 
our first legato sequence from the which
is<00:01:10.390> a<00:01:10.420> hammer<00:01:10.750> on<00:01:10.930> and<00:01:11.080> a<00:01:11.170> pull<00:01:11.380> off<00:01:11.530> from<00:01:11.770> the

00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:11.920 
is a hammer on and a pull off from the

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:14.940 
is a hammer on and a pull off from the
15th<00:01:12.340> fret<00:01:12.520> to<00:01:13.480> the<00:01:13.510> 18th<00:01:13.990> fret<00:01:14.260> then<00:01:14.470> back<00:01:14.680> to

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:14.950 
15th fret to the 18th fret then back to

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:21.900 
15th fret to the 18th fret then back to
the<00:01:15.040> 15th<00:01:20.250> and<00:01:21.250> then<00:01:21.460> we<00:01:21.610> have<00:01:21.760> another

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:21.910 
the 15th and then we have another

00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:25.730 
the 15th and then we have another
sequence

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:28.130 

which<00:01:26.370> the<00:01:26.940> first<00:01:27.180> parts<00:01:27.479> the<00:01:27.600> same<00:01:27.630> a<00:01:27.900> little

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
which the first parts the same a little

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:30.830 
which the first parts the same a little
different<00:01:28.530> rhythm<00:01:28.860> but<00:01:29.369> then<00:01:30.210> the<00:01:30.420> second

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 
different rhythm but then the second

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:33.500 
different rhythm but then the second
hammer-on<00:01:31.320> pull-off<00:01:31.760> combination<00:01:32.760> is<00:01:33.000> here

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:33.510 
hammer-on pull-off combination is here

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:39.530 
hammer-on pull-off combination is here
in<00:01:33.659> the<00:01:33.780> 15th<00:01:34.170> and<00:01:34.320> the<00:01:34.409> 17th<00:01:34.590> frame<00:01:38.240> so<00:01:39.240> all

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:39.540 
in the 15th and the 17th frame so all

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:42.170 
in the 15th and the 17th frame so all
together<00:01:40.040> let's<00:01:41.040> call<00:01:41.280> both<00:01:41.549> of<00:01:41.729> those<00:01:41.850> little

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180 
together let's call both of those little

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:44.570 
together let's call both of those little
parts<00:01:42.540> one<00:01:43.080> segment<00:01:43.380> so<00:01:43.770> here<00:01:43.950> we<00:01:44.040> go<00:01:44.190> this<00:01:44.400> is

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:44.580 
parts one segment so here we go this is

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:54.050 
parts one segment so here we go this is
the<00:01:44.610> first<00:01:44.759> segment

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.060 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:55.610 

and<00:01:54.540> make<00:01:54.690> sure<00:01:54.870> when<00:01:55.050> you're<00:01:55.170> playing<00:01:55.380> legato

00:01:55.610 --> 00:01:55.620 
and make sure when you're playing legato

00:01:55.620 --> 00:01:58.280 
and make sure when you're playing legato
that<00:01:56.130> you<00:01:56.190> don't<00:01:56.400> let<00:01:56.580> these<00:01:56.790> notes<00:01:57.200> you<00:01:58.200> know

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:58.290 
that you don't let these notes you know

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:00.290 
that you don't let these notes you know
kind<00:01:58.530> of<00:01:58.590> disappear<00:01:59.160> on<00:01:59.310> you<00:01:59.520> when<00:02:00.030> you're<00:02:00.120> not

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:00.300 
kind of disappear on you when you're not

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:02.270 
kind of disappear on you when you're not
picking<00:02:00.690> in<00:02:01.230> other<00:02:01.350> words<00:02:01.560> your<00:02:01.830> hammer<00:02:02.100> on

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:02.280 
picking in other words your hammer on

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:07.070 
picking in other words your hammer on
and<00:02:02.610> your<00:02:02.760> pull<00:02:03.000> off<00:02:05.240> should<00:02:06.240> be<00:02:06.360> very<00:02:06.660> clear

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:07.080 
and your pull off should be very clear

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:16.110 
and your pull off should be very clear
whether<00:02:07.380> you're<00:02:07.590> picking<00:02:07.800> or<00:02:08.070> not

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:16.120 

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:18.330 

it's<00:02:16.690> a<00:02:16.780> really<00:02:17.140> practice<00:02:17.620> and<00:02:17.830> work<00:02:18.010> to<00:02:18.160> get

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:18.340 
it's a really practice and work to get

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:21.420 
it's a really practice and work to get
these<00:02:18.459> notes<00:02:18.730> sounding<00:02:19.180> very<00:02:19.510> clearly<00:02:20.430> and

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:21.430 
these notes sounding very clearly and

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:25.440 
these notes sounding very clearly and
then<00:02:22.110> so<00:02:23.110> that's<00:02:23.260> one<00:02:23.560> segment<00:02:24.040> let's<00:02:24.450> move

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:25.450 
then so that's one segment let's move

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:27.740 
then so that's one segment let's move
through<00:02:25.660> the<00:02:25.810> lick<00:02:25.989> we<00:02:26.319> do<00:02:26.500> repeat<00:02:27.489> that

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:27.750 
through the lick we do repeat that

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:38.850 
through the lick we do repeat that
segment<00:02:28.750> three<00:02:29.739> times<00:02:29.980> the<00:02:30.610> total<00:02:30.760> of<00:02:30.970> three

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:38.860 

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:42.360 

okay<00:02:39.640> and<00:02:40.330> then<00:02:41.230> we<00:02:41.350> start<00:02:41.650> with<00:02:41.800> the<00:02:42.010> the

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:42.370 
okay and then we start with the the

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:44.310 
okay and then we start with the the
bending<00:02:42.730> part<00:02:42.760> of<00:02:43.180> this<00:02:43.330> and<00:02:43.840> we'll<00:02:44.020> go<00:02:44.140> from

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:44.320 
bending part of this and we'll go from

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:48.930 
bending part of this and we'll go from
the<00:02:44.440> 17th<00:02:44.920> fret<00:02:45.130> on<00:02:45.250> the<00:02:45.400> third-string<00:02:47.730> to<00:02:48.730> the

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:48.940 
the 17th fret on the third-string to the

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:53.340
