00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:02.869 

so<00:00:00.420> our<00:00:00.599> next<00:00:00.810> test<00:00:01.230> to<00:00:01.500> see<00:00:01.800> how<00:00:02.310> sticky<00:00:02.639> our

00:00:02.869 --> 00:00:02.879 
so our next test to see how sticky our

00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:04.519 
so our next test to see how sticky our
clay<00:00:03.149> is<00:00:03.210> and<00:00:03.540> how<00:00:03.659> much<00:00:03.810> that<00:00:04.290> we<00:00:04.500> have

00:00:04.519 --> 00:00:04.529 
clay is and how much that we have

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:06.920 
clay is and how much that we have
actually<00:00:05.009> clay<00:00:05.400> in<00:00:05.520> our<00:00:05.640> soil<00:00:05.910> is<00:00:06.120> if<00:00:06.600> you<00:00:06.690> take

00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:06.930 
actually clay in our soil is if you take

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:08.600 
actually clay in our soil is if you take
that<00:00:07.109> same<00:00:07.319> clay<00:00:07.919> right<00:00:08.099> out<00:00:08.250> of<00:00:08.340> the<00:00:08.400> ground

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:08.610 
that same clay right out of the ground

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:10.549 
that same clay right out of the ground
or<00:00:09.540> the<00:00:09.570> soil<00:00:09.960> right<00:00:10.170> out<00:00:10.349> of<00:00:10.380> the<00:00:10.500> ground

00:00:10.549 --> 00:00:10.559 
or the soil right out of the ground

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:11.870 
or the soil right out of the ground
because<00:00:10.860> we<00:00:10.950> don't<00:00:11.130> know<00:00:11.190> it<00:00:11.280> has<00:00:11.400> plate<00:00:11.610> and

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:11.880 
because we don't know it has plate and

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:14.930 
because we don't know it has plate and
and<00:00:12.210> I<00:00:12.300> wet<00:00:12.599> it<00:00:12.630> fairly<00:00:13.440> fairly<00:00:13.920> well<00:00:14.190> and<00:00:14.490> you

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:14.940 
and I wet it fairly fairly well and you

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:16.519 
and I wet it fairly fairly well and you
can<00:00:15.089> see<00:00:15.269> it<00:00:15.389> really<00:00:15.660> gets<00:00:15.990> sticking<00:00:16.410> out

00:00:16.519 --> 00:00:16.529 
can see it really gets sticking out

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:18.890 
can see it really gets sticking out
sticking<00:00:17.039> to<00:00:17.190> my<00:00:17.310> hands<00:00:17.789> you<00:00:18.180> know<00:00:18.300> this<00:00:18.720> piece

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:18.900 
sticking to my hands you know this piece

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:20.269 
sticking to my hands you know this piece
just<00:00:18.960> stay<00:00:19.380> even<00:00:19.650> though<00:00:19.680> I<00:00:19.770> turn<00:00:20.039> my<00:00:20.160> hand

00:00:20.269 --> 00:00:20.279 
just stay even though I turn my hand

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:22.310 
just stay even though I turn my hand
upside<00:00:20.640> down<00:00:20.789> it<00:00:20.970> stays<00:00:21.210> on<00:00:21.390> there<00:00:21.660> and<00:00:21.810> I'm

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:22.320 
upside down it stays on there and I'm

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:25.460 
upside down it stays on there and I'm
going<00:00:22.380> to<00:00:22.529> make<00:00:22.650> a<00:00:22.680> worm<00:00:23.750> okay<00:00:24.750> and<00:00:25.050> if<00:00:25.320> you

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:25.470 
going to make a worm okay and if you

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:30.500 
going to make a worm okay and if you
roll<00:00:25.800> that<00:00:26.130> clay<00:00:26.580> into<00:00:27.090> a<00:00:27.119> worm<00:00:29.510> again

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:30.510 
roll that clay into a worm again

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:33.380 
roll that clay into a worm again
remembering<00:00:31.080> that<00:00:31.369> the<00:00:32.369> the<00:00:32.759> structure<00:00:33.149> of

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390 
remembering that the the structure of

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:36.020 
remembering that the the structure of
the<00:00:33.510> clay<00:00:33.780> is<00:00:34.020> a<00:00:34.079> suction<00:00:34.530> cup<00:00:34.800> platelet<00:00:35.309> and<00:00:35.520> I

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:36.030 
the clay is a suction cup platelet and I

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:38.680 
the clay is a suction cup platelet and I
hold<00:00:36.329> it<00:00:36.480> at<00:00:36.630> one<00:00:36.809> end<00:00:37.020> and<00:00:37.410> I<00:00:37.590> let<00:00:37.829> it<00:00:37.860> drop

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:38.690 
hold it at one end and I let it drop

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:41.510 
hold it at one end and I let it drop
only<00:00:39.690> clay<00:00:40.020> is<00:00:40.290> sticky<00:00:40.590> enough<00:00:40.890> to<00:00:41.070> support

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:41.520 
only clay is sticky enough to support

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:43.819 
only clay is sticky enough to support
all<00:00:41.850> of<00:00:42.270> this<00:00:42.420> weight<00:00:42.750> by<00:00:43.140> holding<00:00:43.559> here

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829 
all of this weight by holding here

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:46.220 
all of this weight by holding here
without<00:00:43.980> breaking<00:00:44.280> if<00:00:44.670> this<00:00:45.180> were<00:00:45.420> top<00:00:45.870> soil

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 
without breaking if this were top soil

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:48.650 
without breaking if this were top soil
it<00:00:46.770> would<00:00:46.950> have<00:00:47.070> broken<00:00:47.309> off<00:00:47.579> if<00:00:47.850> it<00:00:48.149> was<00:00:48.300> super

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660 
it would have broken off if it was super

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:51.020 
it would have broken off if it was super
silty<00:00:49.079> it<00:00:49.260> would<00:00:49.410> have<00:00:49.530> broken<00:00:49.770> off<00:00:50.010> only<00:00:50.550> clay

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030 
silty it would have broken off only clay

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:53.660 
silty it would have broken off only clay
is<00:00:51.300> this<00:00:51.660> sticky<00:00:52.170> that<00:00:52.620> it<00:00:52.800> will<00:00:52.980> that<00:00:53.460> it<00:00:53.579> will

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
is this sticky that it will that it will

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:56.330 
is this sticky that it will that it will
actually<00:00:54.090> self<00:00:54.780> support<00:00:55.230> a<00:00:55.350> load<00:00:55.710> right<00:00:56.129> so

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:56.340 
actually self support a load right so

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:58.549 
actually self support a load right so
this<00:00:56.489> is<00:00:56.550> a<00:00:56.699> load<00:00:57.000> it's<00:00:57.239> a<00:00:57.300> weight<00:00:57.539> and<00:00:57.840> I'm

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
this is a load it's a weight and I'm

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:00.830 
this is a load it's a weight and I'm
holding<00:00:58.829> just<00:00:59.219> up<00:00:59.430> here<00:00:59.460> and<00:00:59.910> it's<00:01:00.120> relying<00:01:00.600> on

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
holding just up here and it's relying on

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:02.810 
holding just up here and it's relying on
the<00:01:00.989> stickiness<00:01:01.530> of<00:01:01.739> the<00:01:01.890> clay<00:01:02.129> to<00:01:02.460> hold<00:01:02.699> it

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
the stickiness of the clay to hold it

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:05.299 
the stickiness of the clay to hold it
all<00:01:02.940> together<00:01:03.120> so<00:01:03.539> we<00:01:04.290> know<00:01:04.500> we<00:01:04.650> have<00:01:04.680> clay<00:01:05.040> and

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
all together so we know we have clay and

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:07.490 
all together so we know we have clay and
we<00:01:05.460> know<00:01:05.610> it's<00:01:05.820> sticky<00:01:06.060> now<00:01:06.930> we<00:01:06.990> need<00:01:07.229> to<00:01:07.350> know

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
we know it's sticky now we need to know

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:10.910 
we know it's sticky now we need to know
how<00:01:07.890> much<00:01:08.100> clay<00:01:08.430> do<00:01:08.610> we<00:01:08.729> have<00:01:08.970> in<00:01:09.330> that<00:01:09.630> soil<00:01:10.080> so

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
how much clay do we have in that soil so

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:12.289 
how much clay do we have in that soil so
we<00:01:11.010> do<00:01:11.100> something<00:01:11.460> simple<00:01:11.670> called<00:01:11.970> a<00:01:12.060> shake

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:12.299 
we do something simple called a shake

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:15.940 
we do something simple called a shake
test<00:01:12.600> and<00:01:13.460> what<00:01:14.460> we<00:01:14.580> do<00:01:14.760> is<00:01:15.000> we<00:01:15.180> take<00:01:15.600> some

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:15.950 
test and what we do is we take some

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:19.730 
test and what we do is we take some
sifted<00:01:17.689> modestly<00:01:18.689> sifted<00:01:19.259> we<00:01:19.409> just<00:01:19.590> don't

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
sifted modestly sifted we just don't

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:22.760 
sifted modestly sifted we just don't
want<00:01:19.860> huge<00:01:20.310> lumps<00:01:20.850> of<00:01:21.000> the<00:01:21.900> same<00:01:22.229> soil<00:01:22.590> that

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
want huge lumps of the same soil that

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:24.950 
want huge lumps of the same soil that
we're<00:01:22.920> planning<00:01:23.400> to<00:01:23.549> use<00:01:23.790> we<00:01:24.330> sift<00:01:24.630> that<00:01:24.750> out

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960 
we're planning to use we sift that out

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:29.210 
we're planning to use we sift that out
and<00:01:25.140> we<00:01:25.590> add<00:01:25.740> about<00:01:26.360> 25%<00:01:27.360> of<00:01:27.600> that<00:01:27.710> soil<00:01:28.710> into<00:01:29.189> a

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220 
and we add about 25% of that soil into a

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:32.120 
and we add about 25% of that soil into a
fairly<00:01:29.850> cylindrical<00:01:30.479> jar<00:01:30.659> fill<00:01:31.650> the<00:01:31.799> rest<00:01:31.979> of

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
fairly cylindrical jar fill the rest of

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:35.090 
fairly cylindrical jar fill the rest of
the<00:01:32.220> jar<00:01:32.430> with<00:01:32.579> water<00:01:32.610> and<00:01:33.140> shake<00:01:34.140> it<00:01:34.170> and<00:01:34.530> what

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100 
the jar with water and shake it and what

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:36.260 
the jar with water and shake it and what
you're<00:01:35.220> doing<00:01:35.400> is<00:01:35.640> you<00:01:35.759> want<00:01:35.909> to<00:01:36.000> shake<00:01:36.240> it

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270 
you're doing is you want to shake it

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:39.830 
you're doing is you want to shake it
until<00:01:36.840> all<00:01:37.020> of<00:01:37.650> the<00:01:37.920> clay<00:01:38.360> dissolves<00:01:39.360> off<00:01:39.600> of

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 
until all of the clay dissolves off of

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:44.060 
until all of the clay dissolves off of
any<00:01:40.079> sand<00:01:40.530> that<00:01:40.920> might<00:01:41.159> be<00:01:41.369> in<00:01:41.670> your<00:01:41.700> mix<00:01:42.799> and<00:01:43.799> I

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.070 
any sand that might be in your mix and I

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:46.039 
any sand that might be in your mix and I
need<00:01:44.250> to<00:01:44.430> my<00:01:44.640> hands<00:01:45.030> are<00:01:45.119> muddy<00:01:45.390> so<00:01:45.689> I<00:01:45.720> need<00:01:45.930> to

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:46.049 
need to my hands are muddy so I need to

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:51.020 
need to my hands are muddy so I need to
wipe<00:01:46.619> off<00:01:46.890> the<00:01:47.100> jar<00:01:47.310> so<00:01:47.520> I<00:01:47.549> can<00:01:47.790> see<00:01:48.030> it<00:01:49.009> and<00:01:50.030> I'm

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 
wipe off the jar so I can see it and I'm

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:52.910 
wipe off the jar so I can see it and I'm
I<00:01:51.240> just<00:01:51.659> checked<00:01:51.960> the<00:01:52.079> bottom<00:01:52.439> just<00:01:52.649> to<00:01:52.799> make

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920 
I just checked the bottom just to make

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:55.789 
I just checked the bottom just to make
sure<00:01:53.340> that<00:01:53.670> all<00:01:53.909> I<00:01:53.939> see<00:01:54.360> is<00:01:54.509> sand<00:01:54.960> and<00:01:55.320> no

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:55.799 
sure that all I see is sand and no

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:57.740 
sure that all I see is sand and no
clumps<00:01:56.310> of<00:01:56.430> clay<00:01:56.670> and<00:01:56.909> as<00:01:57.000> soon<00:01:57.210> as<00:01:57.329> I<00:01:57.479> have

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:57.750 
clumps of clay and as soon as I have

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:00.080 
clumps of clay and as soon as I have
that<00:01:57.990> then<00:01:58.590> I<00:01:58.619> know<00:01:58.799> the<00:01:59.070> clay<00:01:59.340> is<00:01:59.579> in<00:01:59.610> solution

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:00.090 
that then I know the clay is in solution

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:04.249 
that then I know the clay is in solution
the<00:02:00.630> clay<00:02:00.869> is<00:02:01.850> suspended<00:02:02.850> in<00:02:02.969> the<00:02:03.090> water

00:02:04.249 --> 00:02:04.259 
the clay is suspended in the water

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:08.029 
the clay is suspended in the water
and<00:02:04.409> then<00:02:05.369> there's<00:02:06.229> the<00:02:07.229> then<00:02:07.649> you're<00:02:07.860> using

00:02:08.029 --> 00:02:08.039 
and then there's the then you're using

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:10.820 
and then there's the then you're using
the<00:02:08.310> fact<00:02:08.580> that<00:02:08.729> sand<00:02:09.239> can't<00:02:09.539> float<00:02:09.810> the<00:02:10.530> clay

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:10.830 
the fact that sand can't float the clay

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:12.530 
the fact that sand can't float the clay
can<00:02:11.039> stay<00:02:11.280> suspended<00:02:11.610> in<00:02:11.970> the<00:02:12.060> water

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:12.540 
can stay suspended in the water

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:15.050 
can stay suspended in the water
but<00:02:12.870> sand<00:02:13.230> has<00:02:13.470> to<00:02:13.680> fall<00:02:14.190> by<00:02:14.370> gravity<00:02:14.849> through

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:15.060 
but sand has to fall by gravity through

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:19.400 
but sand has to fall by gravity through
the<00:02:15.180> water<00:02:15.390> so<00:02:16.140> what<00:02:16.349> we<00:02:16.470> do<00:02:16.650> is<00:02:16.890> we<00:02:17.400> just<00:02:18.410> after

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:19.410 
the water so what we do is we just after

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:20.780 
the water so what we do is we just after
you've<00:02:19.530> shaken<00:02:19.769> it<00:02:20.010> let<00:02:20.190> it<00:02:20.220> just<00:02:20.430> kind<00:02:20.730> of

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:20.790 
you've shaken it let it just kind of

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:22.759 
you've shaken it let it just kind of
calm<00:02:21.000> down<00:02:21.209> a<00:02:21.239> little<00:02:21.450> bit<00:02:21.660> and<00:02:21.930> I'm<00:02:22.500> going<00:02:22.680> to

00:02:22.759 --> 00:02:22.769 
calm down a little bit and I'm going to

00:02:22.769 --> 00:02:24.620 
calm down a little bit and I'm going to
just<00:02:23.099> sort<00:02:23.220> of<00:02:23.340> gently<00:02:23.610> turn<00:02:23.940> it<00:02:24.090> in<00:02:24.209> turn<00:02:24.599> it

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:24.630 
just sort of gently turn it in turn it

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:27.440 
just sort of gently turn it in turn it
over<00:02:24.870> onto<00:02:25.290> a<00:02:25.800> reasonably<00:02:26.430> level<00:02:26.760> surface<00:02:27.180> and

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:27.450 
over onto a reasonably level surface and

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:30.710 
over onto a reasonably level surface and
within<00:02:28.140> ten<00:02:29.010> to<00:02:29.160> thirty<00:02:29.400> seconds<00:02:29.880> you<00:02:30.480> can

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:30.720 
within ten to thirty seconds you can

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:34.640 
within ten to thirty seconds you can
watch<00:02:30.959> all<00:02:31.290> of<00:02:31.590> the<00:02:31.680> sand<00:02:31.980> drop<00:02:32.310> out<00:02:32.780> so<00:02:33.780> you

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:34.650 
watch all of the sand drop out so you

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:37.370 
watch all of the sand drop out so you
can<00:02:34.860> see<00:02:34.890> that<00:02:35.280> there's<00:02:35.630> there's<00:02:36.630> a<00:02:36.690> line<00:02:37.049> at

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:37.380 
can see that there's there's a line at

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:40.640 
can see that there's there's a line at
the<00:02:37.410> bottom<00:02:37.830> here<00:02:38.190> and<00:02:38.690> the<00:02:39.690> water<00:02:39.930> is<00:02:40.260> dirty

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:40.650 
the bottom here and the water is dirty

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:44.420 
the bottom here and the water is dirty
with<00:02:41.040> suspended<00:02:41.730> clay<00:02:42.030> and<00:02:42.440> this<00:02:43.440> line<00:02:43.799> where

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:44.430 
with suspended clay and this line where

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:46.759 
with suspended clay and this line where
I<00:02:44.459> see<00:02:44.760> the<00:02:44.910> solid<00:02:45.390> has<00:02:45.500> settled

00:02:46.759 --> 00:02:46.769 
I see the solid has settled

00:02:46.769 --> 00:02:50.839 
I see the solid has settled
that's<00:02:47.280> my<00:02:47.579> sand<00:02:47.970> line<00:02:48.239> okay<00:02:49.170> so<00:02:49.230> then<00:02:49.670> this<00:02:50.670> is

00:02:50.839 --> 00:02:50.849 
that's my sand line okay so then this is

00:02:50.849 --> 00:02:53.150 
that's my sand line okay so then this is
a<00:02:50.880> shake<00:02:51.540> test<00:02:51.750> that<00:02:51.930> is<00:02:52.049> completed<00:02:52.590> what

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:53.160 
a shake test that is completed what

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:55.460 
a shake test that is completed what
you're<00:02:53.310> waiting<00:02:53.549> for<00:02:53.760> then<00:02:54.150> and<00:02:54.450> sometimes<00:02:55.319> it

00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:55.470 
you're waiting for then and sometimes it

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:57.170 
you're waiting for then and sometimes it
can<00:02:55.590> take<00:02:55.620> a<00:02:55.829> day<00:02:55.950> sometimes<00:02:56.610> even<00:02:57.030> more

00:02:57.170 --> 00:02:57.180 
can take a day sometimes even more

00:02:57.180 --> 00:02:59.660 
can take a day sometimes even more
you're<00:02:58.110> waiting<00:02:58.500> then<00:02:58.620> for<00:02:58.860> all<00:02:59.010> of<00:02:59.040> that<00:02:59.489> you

00:02:59.660 --> 00:02:59.670 
you're waiting then for all of that you

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:01.850 
you're waiting then for all of that you
draw<00:02:59.910> a<00:02:59.940> line<00:03:00.209> where<00:03:00.540> you<00:03:00.660> see<00:03:00.870> the<00:03:01.049> sand<00:03:01.590> and

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:01.860 
draw a line where you see the sand and

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:03.650 
draw a line where you see the sand and
you're<00:03:02.069> then<00:03:02.340> waiting<00:03:02.849> for<00:03:03.060> all<00:03:03.180> of<00:03:03.209> the<00:03:03.450> clay

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:03.660 
you're then waiting for all of the clay

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:05.000 
you're then waiting for all of the clay
to<00:03:03.720> come<00:03:03.989> out<00:03:04.170> of<00:03:04.319> solution<00:03:04.500> out<00:03:04.980> of

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:05.010 
to come out of solution out of

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:05.690 
to come out of solution out of
suspension

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:05.700 
suspension

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:08.599 
suspension
in<00:03:05.819> that<00:03:06.150> in<00:03:06.360> the<00:03:06.599> water<00:03:06.810> so<00:03:07.650> this<00:03:08.099> is<00:03:08.280> a<00:03:08.310> shake

00:03:08.599 --> 00:03:08.609 
in that in the water so this is a shake

00:03:08.609 --> 00:03:10.670 
in that in the water so this is a shake
test<00:03:08.850> that<00:03:09.060> we<00:03:09.150> did<00:03:09.269> about<00:03:09.420> a<00:03:09.540> month<00:03:09.600> ago<00:03:09.900> this

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:10.680 
test that we did about a month ago this

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:13.160 
test that we did about a month ago this
first<00:03:11.100> line<00:03:11.430> was<00:03:12.000> where<00:03:12.239> we<00:03:12.389> saw<00:03:12.630> the<00:03:12.690> sand

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:13.170 
first line was where we saw the sand

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:16.789 
first line was where we saw the sand
settle<00:03:13.700> this<00:03:14.700> second<00:03:15.329> line<00:03:15.510> on<00:03:15.840> our<00:03:16.200> jar<00:03:16.500> is

00:03:16.789 --> 00:03:16.799 
settle this second line on our jar is

00:03:16.799 --> 00:03:19.160 
settle this second line on our jar is
where<00:03:17.760> the<00:03:17.880> clay<00:03:18.150> eventually<00:03:18.630> settled<00:03:18.989> to

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:19.170 
where the clay eventually settled to

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:21.379 
where the clay eventually settled to
I've<00:03:19.859> moved<00:03:20.190> this<00:03:20.400> around<00:03:20.670> so<00:03:20.880> the<00:03:21.000> water<00:03:21.180> got

00:03:21.379 --> 00:03:21.389 
I've moved this around so the water got

00:03:21.389 --> 00:03:22.789 
I've moved this around so the water got
cloudy<00:03:21.690> again<00:03:21.870> but<00:03:22.200> the<00:03:22.319> water<00:03:22.500> should<00:03:22.680> be

00:03:22.789 --> 00:03:22.799 
cloudy again but the water should be

00:03:22.799 --> 00:03:24.860 
cloudy again but the water should be
completely<00:03:23.430> clear<00:03:23.970> when<00:03:24.269> all<00:03:24.450> of<00:03:24.569> the<00:03:24.690> clay

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:24.870 
completely clear when all of the clay

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:27.199 
completely clear when all of the clay
has<00:03:25.079> settled<00:03:25.410> and<00:03:25.760> then<00:03:26.760> the<00:03:27.000> way<00:03:27.150> you

00:03:27.199 --> 00:03:27.209 
has settled and then the way you

00:03:27.209 --> 00:03:29.479 
has settled and then the way you
determine<00:03:27.870> the<00:03:27.959> percentage<00:03:28.470> of<00:03:28.650> clay<00:03:29.010> versus

00:03:29.479 --> 00:03:29.489 
determine the percentage of clay versus

00:03:29.489 --> 00:03:32.780 
determine the percentage of clay versus
sand<00:03:30.209> that's<00:03:30.569> in<00:03:30.810> your<00:03:30.989> soil<00:03:31.290> is<00:03:31.620> you<00:03:32.400> simply

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:32.790 
sand that's in your soil is you simply

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:37.789 
sand that's in your soil is you simply
measure<00:03:33.090> the<00:03:34.519> height<00:03:35.519> of<00:03:35.840> the<00:03:36.840> line<00:03:37.049> from<00:03:37.680> the

00:03:37.789 --> 00:03:37.799 
measure the height of the line from the

00:03:37.799 --> 00:03:39.470 
measure the height of the line from the
bottom<00:03:38.160> the<00:03:38.370> height<00:03:38.609> this<00:03:38.910> is<00:03:38.940> why<00:03:39.180> it<00:03:39.239> needs

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:39.480 
bottom the height this is why it needs

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:41.479 
bottom the height this is why it needs
to<00:03:39.540> be<00:03:39.600> fairly<00:03:39.900> cylindrical<00:03:40.620> you<00:03:41.069> measure<00:03:41.280> the

00:03:41.479 --> 00:03:41.489 
to be fairly cylindrical you measure the

00:03:41.489 --> 00:03:44.090 
to be fairly cylindrical you measure the
height<00:03:41.519> of<00:03:41.760> the<00:03:42.389> first<00:03:42.600> line<00:03:42.930> and<00:03:43.170> then<00:03:43.950> the

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:44.100 
height of the first line and then the

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:45.890 
height of the first line and then the
height<00:03:44.310> between<00:03:44.579> the<00:03:44.970> first<00:03:45.209> line<00:03:45.450> and<00:03:45.690> the

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:45.900 
height between the first line and the

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:48.740 
height between the first line and the
second<00:03:46.260> line<00:03:46.290> so<00:03:47.069> we<00:03:47.220> have<00:03:47.400> about<00:03:47.609> one<00:03:48.000> inch<00:03:48.239> to

00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:48.750 
second line so we have about one inch to

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:50.900 
second line so we have about one inch to
our<00:03:48.870> first<00:03:49.139> line<00:03:49.410> and<00:03:49.650> then<00:03:50.310> one<00:03:50.700> and<00:03:50.849> a

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:50.910 
our first line and then one and a

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:53.479 
our first line and then one and a
quarter<00:03:51.299> inches<00:03:51.630> between<00:03:52.139> the<00:03:52.709> first<00:03:53.220> line

00:03:53.479 --> 00:03:53.489 
quarter inches between the first line

00:03:53.489 --> 00:03:55.490 
quarter inches between the first line
and<00:03:53.790> the<00:03:53.940> second<00:03:54.329> line<00:03:54.359> so<00:03:55.019> that<00:03:55.170> means<00:03:55.349> we

00:03:55.490 --> 00:03:55.500 
and the second line so that means we

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:57.979 
and the second line so that means we
have<00:03:55.620> one<00:03:55.650> parts<00:03:56.130> and<00:03:56.400> to<00:03:57.299> one<00:03:57.480> and<00:03:57.660> a<00:03:57.720> quarter

00:03:57.979 --> 00:03:57.989 
have one parts and to one and a quarter

00:03:57.989 --> 00:04:00.620 
have one parts and to one and a quarter
parts<00:03:58.290> clay
