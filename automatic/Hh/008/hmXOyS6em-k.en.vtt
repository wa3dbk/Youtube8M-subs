concerns people have about using a

00:00:23.170 --> 00:00:24.720 
concerns people have about using a
walker<00:00:23.439> with<00:00:23.769> wheels<00:00:24.130> these<00:00:24.310> people<00:00:24.640> that

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:24.730 
walker with wheels these people that

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:26.220 
walker with wheels these people that
have<00:00:24.849> brought<00:00:24.970> up<00:00:25.119> over<00:00:25.420> the<00:00:25.510> years<00:00:25.689> to<00:00:25.869> me<00:00:26.019> is

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:26.230 
have brought up over the years to me is

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:27.689 
have brought up over the years to me is
that<00:00:26.380> they're<00:00:26.560> afraid<00:00:26.650> that<00:00:26.920> Walker<00:00:27.369> is<00:00:27.640> going

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:27.699 
that they're afraid that Walker is going

00:00:27.699 --> 00:00:29.880 
that they're afraid that Walker is going
to<00:00:27.910> get<00:00:28.029> away<00:00:28.150> from<00:00:28.330> and<00:00:28.750> they<00:00:28.840> go<00:00:28.990> you<00:00:29.800> know

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:29.890 
to get away from and they go you know

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:32.339 
to get away from and they go you know
but<00:00:30.490> the<00:00:30.609> thing<00:00:30.789> is<00:00:30.820> when<00:00:31.359> you<00:00:31.509> have<00:00:31.539> the<00:00:32.140> two

00:00:32.339 --> 00:00:32.349 
but the thing is when you have the two

00:00:32.349 --> 00:00:34.320 
but the thing is when you have the two
back<00:00:32.619> legs<00:00:32.650> here<00:00:33.520> and<00:00:33.550> they<00:00:33.880> don't<00:00:34.090> have

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:34.330 
back legs here and they don't have

00:00:34.330 --> 00:00:36.200 
back legs here and they don't have
wheels<00:00:34.540> on<00:00:34.780> it<00:00:34.840> this<00:00:35.140> is<00:00:35.320> a<00:00:35.380> pretty<00:00:35.620> stable

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:36.210 
wheels on it this is a pretty stable

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:38.580 
wheels on it this is a pretty stable
this<00:00:37.210> is<00:00:37.420> probably<00:00:37.750> the<00:00:37.870> Walker<00:00:38.110> of<00:00:38.379> choice

00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:38.590 
this is probably the Walker of choice

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:40.139 
this is probably the Walker of choice
that<00:00:38.890> we<00:00:39.040> use<00:00:39.219> with<00:00:39.399> most<00:00:39.550> of<00:00:39.760> our<00:00:39.879> patients

00:00:40.139 --> 00:00:40.149 
that we use with most of our patients

00:00:40.149 --> 00:00:42.360 
that we use with most of our patients
and<00:00:40.600> the<00:00:41.200> reason<00:00:41.500> it's<00:00:41.649> better<00:00:41.860> than<00:00:42.039> just<00:00:42.280> a

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:42.370 
and the reason it's better than just a

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:44.940 
and the reason it's better than just a
regular<00:00:42.579> Walker<00:00:43.000> without<00:00:43.510> wheels<00:00:43.840> is<00:00:44.680> because

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:44.950 
regular Walker without wheels is because

00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:46.440 
regular Walker without wheels is because
if<00:00:45.070> you're<00:00:45.250> walking<00:00:45.640> along<00:00:45.820> and<00:00:46.000> let's<00:00:46.329> say

that<00:01:16.210> Walker<00:01:16.510> up<00:01:16.720> every<00:01:16.990> step<00:01:17.260> it's<00:01:17.890> a<00:01:18.040> common

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:18.430 
that Walker up every step it's a common

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:20.730 
that Walker up every step it's a common
thing<00:01:18.550> that<00:01:18.610> the<00:01:19.540> back<00:01:19.750> would<00:01:19.990> be<00:01:20.110> irritated

adhesive on there so you just take off
and<00:03:10.470> you're<00:03:10.590> gonna<00:03:10.680> put<00:03:10.920> it<00:03:10.950> on<00:03:11.100> the<00:03:11.250> back<00:03:11.459> like

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:11.760 
and you're gonna put it on the back like

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:16.699 
and you're gonna put it on the back like
this<00:03:14.329> perfect<00:03:15.329> and<00:03:15.450> then<00:03:15.989> what<00:03:16.170> you<00:03:16.320> do<00:03:16.470> need

00:03:16.699 --> 00:03:16.709 
this perfect and then what you do need

00:03:16.709 --> 00:03:18.440 
this perfect and then what you do need
to<00:03:16.829> do<00:03:16.980> is<00:03:17.280> you're<00:03:17.489> gonna<00:03:17.609> have<00:03:17.880> to<00:03:18.000> tape<00:03:18.209> it<00:03:18.359> in

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:18.450 
to do is you're gonna have to tape it in

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:20.150 
to do is you're gonna have to tape it in
place<00:03:18.480> though<00:03:18.959> because<00:03:19.200> these<00:03:19.590> could<00:03:19.890> flip

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:20.160 
place though because these could flip

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:22.819 
place though because these could flip
off<00:03:20.400> sure<00:03:20.880> adhesive<00:03:21.600> isn't<00:03:22.019> quite<00:03:22.170> yeah<00:03:22.440> it

00:03:22.819 --> 00:03:22.829 
off sure adhesive isn't quite yeah it

00:03:22.829 --> 00:03:25.819 
off sure adhesive isn't quite yeah it
works<00:03:23.340> pretty<00:03:23.549> well<00:03:23.670> at<00:03:23.940> all<00:03:24.120> but<00:03:24.810> what<00:03:25.799> I

00:03:25.819 --> 00:03:25.829 
works pretty well at all but what I

00:03:25.829 --> 00:03:28.009 
works pretty well at all but what I
would<00:03:26.040> take<00:03:26.370> probably<00:03:26.760> the<00:03:27.090> universal<00:03:27.660> duct

00:03:28.009 --> 00:03:28.019 
would take probably the universal duct

00:03:28.019 --> 00:03:30.289 
would take probably the universal duct
tape<00:03:28.290> yeah<00:03:28.530> probably<00:03:28.920> I<00:03:29.190> use<00:03:29.820> electrical<00:03:30.239> tape

00:03:30.289 --> 00:03:30.299 
tape yeah probably I use electrical tape

00:03:30.299 --> 00:03:32.690 
tape yeah probably I use electrical tape
myself<00:03:30.900> but<00:03:31.140> I<00:03:31.320> think<00:03:31.620> Rabbitohs<00:03:32.100> electrical

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:32.700 
myself but I think Rabbitohs electrical

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:35.000 
myself but I think Rabbitohs electrical
tape<00:03:32.880> okay<00:03:33.239> that's<00:03:33.420> just<00:03:33.510> me<00:03:33.840> because<00:03:34.739> that's

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:35.010 
tape okay that's just me because that's

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:36.920 
tape okay that's just me because that's
smaller<00:03:35.370> or<00:03:35.670> why<00:03:35.910> because<00:03:36.359> it's<00:03:36.510> kind<00:03:36.810> of

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:36.930 
smaller or why because it's kind of

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:38.530 
smaller or why because it's kind of
stretches<00:03:37.500> that<00:03:37.560> you<00:03:37.620> can<00:03:37.799> really<00:03:38.040> talk<00:03:38.250> about

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:38.540 
stretches that you can really talk about

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:40.390 
stretches that you can really talk about
alright<00:03:39.540> now<00:03:39.870> you<00:03:39.930> can<00:03:40.170> get

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:40.400 
alright now you can get

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:42.309 
alright now you can get
different<00:03:40.700> colors<00:03:41.000> too<00:03:41.150> like<00:03:41.329> that<00:03:41.360> day<00:03:41.720> so

00:03:42.309 --> 00:03:42.319
