00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.080
 I want to think in this video 

00:00:00.164 --> 00:00:02.080
 What I want to do in the video is to think, 

00:00:02.080 --> 00:00:05.430
 whether the work or the sum of rational numbers 

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:07.550
 will surely be a rational number. 

00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:08.930
 Let's look first 

00:00:08.930 --> 00:00:10.939
 the product of rational numbers. 

00:00:10.939 --> 00:00:12.511
 If I have a rational number and ... 

00:00:12.511 --> 00:00:14.938
 Actually let me instead of writing the word rationally, 

00:00:14.938 --> 00:00:17.890
 just to represent it as a relation of two integers. 

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:20.010
 So, I have a rational number here. 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:22.390
 I can present it as a / b. 

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:26.240
 And I will multiply it by another rational number, 

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:30.350
 which will also represent as a relation of two integers, m and n. 

00:00:30.350 --> 00:00:32.280
 What will this work be? 

00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:36.975
 In the numerator I will have an am. 

00:00:36.975 --> 00:00:40.640
 I'll have a m. 

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:46.480
 And in the denominator I will have b on n. 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:49.000
 but is an integer, m is an integer. 

00:00:49.004 --> 00:00:50.670
 Therefore, we have an integer in the numerator. 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:52.600
 b is also an integer and n is an integer. 

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:54.770
 Therefore, we have an integer in the denominator as well. 

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:58.140
 So, now the work is the attitude of the two integers here, 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:00.770
 so the work is also a rational number. 

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:03.480
 Therefore, this is also a rational number. 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:07.370
 Therefore, the work of two arbitrary rational numbers 

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:10.020
 is a rational number. 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:11.706
 Let's see if the same applies to 

00:01:11.706 --> 00:01:13.690
 the sum of two rational numbers. 

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:15.690
 Let's say the first rational number is a / b 

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:19.700
 or we can imagine it as a / b, 

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:21.330
 and the second rational number 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:24.950
 can be represented as m / n. 

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:26.750
 How will I collect them? 

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:28.340
 Well can I find a common denominator, 

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:31.380
 the easiest is b on n. 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:33.590
 Let's multiply this liver. 

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:36.670
 I multiply this by n in the numerator and n 

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:38.220
 in the denominator. 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:40.390
 And let's multiply this by 

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:42.882
 b in the numerator and b in the denominator. 

00:01:42.882 --> 00:01:44.340
 Now we've written them so they have it 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:46.610
 common denominator bn. 

00:01:46.610 --> 00:02:02.920
 This will be equal to an plus plus bm, 

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:10.800
 the whole on b on n. 

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:13.120
 For b n we have just proven, 

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:15.810
 that it is definitely an integer. 

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:18.530
 And what do we have here on top? 

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:21.500
 We have a n, which is an integer, 

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:23.050
 and b on m, which is another integer. 

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:24.720
 The sum of two integers will be an integer. 

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:26.470
 Therefore, you have an integer on an integer. 

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:27.940
 You deal with two integers. 

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:31.380
 So the sum of two rational numbers 

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:33.290
 will give us another one. 

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:35.520
 This here was a rational number 

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:37.500
 and this here is a rational number. 

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:39.040
 Therefore, if you are looking for the work of two rational numbers, 

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:39.840
 you will get a rational number. 

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:41.710
 If you are looking for the sum of two rational numbers, 

00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:45.160
 you will get a rational number.
