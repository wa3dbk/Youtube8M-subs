again I mean you know this has happened
to<00:00:43.920> him<00:00:44.040> before<00:00:44.190> and<00:00:44.489> a<00:00:44.550> second<00:00:44.850> water<00:00:45.030> could

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300 
to him before and a second water could

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:47.270 
to him before and a second water could
get<00:00:45.450> come<00:00:45.690> confidence<00:00:46.469> yes<00:00:46.680> as<00:00:46.860> goal<00:00:47.039> kicking

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280 
get come confidence yes as goal kicking

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:48.830 
get come confidence yes as goal kicking
isn't<00:00:47.760> as<00:00:47.910> good<00:00:48.059> as<00:00:48.210> Ronan<00:00:48.450> O'Gara

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840 
isn't as good as Ronan O'Gara

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:50.299 
isn't as good as Ronan O'Gara
and<00:00:49.020> yes<00:00:49.200> that<00:00:49.410> could<00:00:49.590> be<00:00:49.710> crucial<00:00:49.890> against

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:50.309 
and yes that could be crucial against

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:52.279 
and yes that could be crucial against
Italy<00:00:50.610> but<00:00:51.059> I<00:00:51.090> think<00:00:51.329> it's<00:00:51.510> I<00:00:51.690> think<00:00:51.840> that<00:00:52.140> dick
