day as my new hunter deck it is very
much<00:00:56.100> an<00:00:56.370> aggro<00:00:56.730> deck<00:00:56.969> that<00:00:57.480> being<00:00:57.690> said

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:57.870 
much an aggro deck that being said

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:00.799 
much an aggro deck that being said
though<00:00:58.079> I<00:00:58.410> the<00:00:59.010> the<00:00:59.430> meta<00:00:59.730> of<00:01:00.030> hearthstone

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809 
though I the the meta of hearthstone

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:03.979 
though I the the meta of hearthstone
right<00:01:01.020> now<00:01:01.170> is<00:01:01.500> entirely<00:01:02.570> adro<00:01:03.570> so<00:01:03.750> the<00:01:03.870> reason

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
right now is entirely adro so the reason

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:06.140 
right now is entirely adro so the reason
I<00:01:04.170> had<00:01:04.290> to<00:01:04.379> make<00:01:04.619> an<00:01:04.860> aggro<00:01:05.189> deck<00:01:05.369> was<00:01:05.610> to<00:01:05.850> kind

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
I had to make an aggro deck was to kind

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:08.030 
I had to make an aggro deck was to kind
of<00:01:06.270> combat<00:01:06.659> other<00:01:06.990> aggro<00:01:07.500> decks<00:01:07.740> even<00:01:07.979> though

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
of combat other aggro decks even though

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:10.310 
of combat other aggro decks even though
that<00:01:08.189> doesn't<00:01:08.369> make<00:01:08.549> sense<00:01:08.790> usually<00:01:09.689> what<00:01:10.200> you

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
that doesn't make sense usually what you

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:12.170 
that doesn't make sense usually what you
want<00:01:10.590> to<00:01:10.740> do<00:01:10.890> against<00:01:11.250> a<00:01:11.400> droid<00:01:11.640> x<00:01:11.850> is<00:01:12.000> make

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 
want to do against a droid x is make

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:13.910 
want to do against a droid x is make
some<00:01:12.390> sort<00:01:12.600> of<00:01:12.630> control<00:01:12.840> deck<00:01:13.320> that<00:01:13.590> can<00:01:13.770> you

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
some sort of control deck that can you

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:16.160 
some sort of control deck that can you
know<00:01:14.040> slow<00:01:14.369> down<00:01:14.610> the<00:01:14.880> aggression<00:01:15.360> but<00:01:15.960> that<00:01:16.140> a

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
know slow down the aggression but that a

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:19.310 
know slow down the aggression but that a
lot<00:01:16.530> of<00:01:16.560> the<00:01:16.650> times<00:01:16.890> does<00:01:17.250> not<00:01:17.490> work<00:01:17.759> so<00:01:18.390> how<00:01:19.259> do

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:02.660 
head bro game that game is so good

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:03.940 
head bro game that game is so good
that's<00:04:02.990> what<00:04:03.110> makes<00:04:03.290> the<00:04:03.380> game<00:04:03.530> so<00:04:03.590> good

though<00:04:04.130> um<00:04:04.340> yeah<00:04:05.120> but<00:04:05.390> like<00:04:05.480> newer<00:04:05.720> games<00:04:05.960> um<00:04:06.350> I

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:07.100 
though um yeah but like newer games um I

00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:09.250 
though um yeah but like newer games um I
think<00:04:07.820> the<00:04:08.060> reason<00:04:08.240> that<00:04:08.390> I<00:04:08.510> don't<00:04:08.780> like<00:04:08.960> latch

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:09.260 
think the reason that I don't like latch

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:11.950 
think the reason that I don't like latch
on<00:04:09.590> I<00:04:09.620> guess<00:04:10.040> to<00:04:10.430> newer<00:04:10.790> games<00:04:11.060> or<00:04:11.780> that<00:04:11.930> I

00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:11.960 
on I guess to newer games or that I

00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:15.310 
on I guess to newer games or that I
don't<00:04:12.170> like<00:04:12.350> them<00:04:12.590> as<00:04:12.800> much<00:04:12.830> is<00:04:13.660> because<00:04:14.660> they

00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:15.320 
don't like them as much is because they

00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:19.240 
don't like them as much is because they
lack<00:04:15.860> like<00:04:16.310> the<00:04:16.940> challenge<00:04:17.450> and<00:04:18.110> the<00:04:18.769> actual

00:04:19.240 --> 00:04:19.250 
lack like the challenge and the actual

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:21.580 
lack like the challenge and the actual
like<00:04:19.549> self<00:04:19.970> realization<00:04:20.810> that<00:04:21.049> this<00:04:21.260> is<00:04:21.470> a

00:04:21.580 --> 00:04:21.590 
like self realization that this is a

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:23.740 
like self realization that this is a

00:05:27.100 --> 00:05:27.110 
like I say I think the only time that

00:05:27.110 --> 00:05:30.250 
like I say I think the only time that
this<00:05:27.770> deck<00:05:28.160> ever<00:05:28.400> really<00:05:28.700> loses<00:05:29.150> is<00:05:29.419> against

00:05:30.250 --> 00:05:30.260 
this deck ever really loses is against

this deck ever really loses is against
mech<00:05:30.440> mage<00:05:30.680> because<00:05:31.070> mech<00:05:31.280> mage<00:05:31.460> is<00:05:31.700> the<00:05:32.030> other

00:05:32.440 --> 00:05:32.450 
mech mage because mech mage is the other

00:05:32.450 --> 00:05:35.590 
mech mage because mech mage is the other
side<00:05:33.020> of<00:05:33.050> the<00:05:33.320> coin<00:05:33.560> of<00:05:33.919> the<00:05:34.370> most<00:05:35.330> hyper

00:05:35.590 --> 00:05:35.600 
side of the coin of the most hyper

00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:41.830 
side of the coin of the most hyper
aggressive<00:05:35.870> decks<00:05:36.320> right<00:05:36.500> now<00:05:36.650> so<00:05:40.660> he'll<00:05:41.660> he's

gonna know that I have explosive trap
hopefully<00:05:44.090> doesn't<00:05:44.240> have<00:05:44.449> anything<00:05:44.630> to<00:05:44.840> deal

00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:45.050 
hopefully doesn't have anything to deal

00:05:45.050 --> 00:05:52.230 
hopefully doesn't have anything to deal
with<00:05:45.229> it<00:05:47.470> um<00:05:48.470> I<00:05:49.479> don't<00:05:50.479> think<00:05:50.660> I<00:05:50.840> have<00:05:51.050> any<00:05:51.320> more

00:05:52.230 --> 00:05:52.240 
with it um I don't think I have any more

00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:56.560 
with it um I don't think I have any more
secrets<00:05:53.240> in<00:05:53.630> my<00:05:53.750> entire<00:05:54.139> deck<00:05:55.330> so<00:05:56.330> I<00:05:56.360> think<00:05:56.450> I

00:05:56.560 --> 00:05:56.570 
secrets in my entire deck so I think I

00:05:56.570 --> 00:05:58.660 
secrets in my entire deck so I think I
might<00:05:56.750> just<00:05:56.930> hit<00:05:57.320> face<00:05:57.620> here

00:05:58.660 --> 00:05:58.670 
might just hit face here

might just hit face here
is<00:05:59.450> it<00:05:59.630> not<00:05:59.810> so<00:06:00.350> I<00:06:00.770> mean<00:06:01.610> I<00:06:02.620> don't<00:06:03.620> really<00:06:03.890> know

00:06:04.060 --> 00:06:04.070
