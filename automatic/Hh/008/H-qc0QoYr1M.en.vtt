exact year I'm notch I think it does but
as<00:01:28.950> far<00:01:29.130> as<00:01:29.189> like<00:01:29.490> it<00:01:29.670> just<00:01:29.939> hints<00:01:30.270> at<00:01:30.390> it<00:01:30.540> every

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:30.900 
as far as like it just hints at it every

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:32.600 
as far as like it just hints at it every
once<00:01:31.079> in<00:01:31.170> a<00:01:31.200> while<00:01:31.350> and<00:01:31.590> it's<00:01:31.740> like<00:01:31.979> it's<00:01:32.250> not

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
once in a while and it's like it's not

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:35.179 
once in a while and it's like it's not
trying<00:01:32.939> to<00:01:33.030> be<00:01:33.180> a<00:01:33.450> book<00:01:34.259> set<00:01:34.500> in<00:01:34.530> the<00:01:34.680> 80s<00:01:35.100> I

don't think I think it's more like let's
tell<00:01:36.990> her<00:01:37.140> origin<00:01:37.590> story<00:01:37.829> without<00:01:38.040> making<00:01:38.579> it

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
tell her origin story without making it

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:41.300 
tell her origin story without making it
seem<00:01:38.909> gimmicky<00:01:39.450> and<00:01:39.630> I<00:01:39.990> think<00:01:40.320> that<00:01:40.590> Candace

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
seem gimmicky and I think that Candace

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:42.770 
seem gimmicky and I think that Candace
Bushnell<00:01:41.700> did<00:01:41.850> a<00:01:41.909> really<00:01:42.150> good<00:01:42.299> job<00:01:42.360> at<00:01:42.750> that

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780 
Bushnell did a really good job at that

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:44.719 
Bushnell did a really good job at that
and<00:01:43.200> I<00:01:43.560> thought<00:01:43.979> that<00:01:44.130> that<00:01:44.250> was<00:01:44.369> amazing

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:44.729 
and I thought that that was amazing

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:47.030 
and I thought that that was amazing
because<00:01:45.060> it<00:01:45.270> wasn't<00:01:45.689> just<00:01:45.780> like<00:01:46.020> let's<00:01:46.710> talk

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.040 
because it wasn't just like let's talk

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:49.310 
because it wasn't just like let's talk
about<00:01:47.189> all<00:01:47.369> these<00:01:47.759> crazy<00:01:48.030> things<00:01:48.360> I<00:01:48.659> think<00:01:49.140> it

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:49.320 
about all these crazy things I think it

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:52.719 
about all these crazy things I think it
might<00:01:49.710> mention<00:01:50.240> some<00:01:51.240> singers<00:01:51.720> everyone's<00:01:52.259> no

00:01:52.719 --> 00:01:52.729 
might mention some singers everyone's no

00:01:52.729 --> 00:01:56.569 
might mention some singers everyone's no
not<00:01:53.729> even<00:01:53.820> think<00:01:54.119> so<00:01:54.240> it<00:01:54.420> might<00:01:54.689> know<00:01:55.619> I<00:01:56.070> really

00:01:56.569 --> 00:01:56.579 
not even think so it might know I really

00:01:56.579 --> 00:01:58.520 
not even think so it might know I really
don't<00:01:56.729> think<00:01:56.790> so<00:01:57.090> i<00:01:57.390> think<00:01:57.869> it<00:01:58.140> just<00:01:58.170> kind<00:01:58.500> of

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:58.530 
don't think so i think it just kind of

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:01.100 
don't think so i think it just kind of
sticks<00:01:58.770> to<00:01:58.890> being<00:01:59.130> like<00:01:59.369> this<00:01:59.969> is<00:02:00.030> a<00:02:00.390> just<00:02:00.930> a

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:01.110 
sticks to being like this is a just a

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:03.230 
sticks to being like this is a just a
novel<00:02:01.530> talking<00:02:02.159> about<00:02:02.369> her<00:02:02.490> orange<00:02:02.820> and<00:02:02.969> story

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:03.240 
novel talking about her orange and story

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:05.120 
novel talking about her orange and story
and<00:02:03.540> it<00:02:03.930> just<00:02:04.079> so<00:02:04.200> happens<00:02:04.530> to<00:02:04.649> be<00:02:04.680> set<00:02:04.920> in<00:02:05.040> the

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:05.130 
and it just so happens to be set in the

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:07.340 
and it just so happens to be set in the
80s<00:02:05.460> but<00:02:05.670> it's<00:02:05.820> not<00:02:06.000> like<00:02:06.630> she's<00:02:06.930> not<00:02:07.110> throwing

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:07.350 
80s but it's not like she's not throwing

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:08.760 
80s but it's not like she's not throwing
out<00:02:07.619> brand<00:02:08.039> names<00:02:08.369> and

00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:08.770 
out brand names and

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:10.740 
out brand names and
like<00:02:09.010> that<00:02:09.190> I<00:02:09.220> don't<00:02:09.520> think<00:02:09.790> she<00:02:10.570> might

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:10.750 
like that I don't think she might

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:13.320 
like that I don't think she might
mention<00:02:10.960> a<00:02:11.170> car<00:02:11.440> I<00:02:11.830> know<00:02:12.640> she<00:02:12.790> I<00:02:12.940> think<00:02:13.120> she

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:13.330 
mention a car I know she I think she

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:16.470 
mention a car I know she I think she
definitely<00:02:14.160> mentioned<00:02:15.160> Sebastian's<00:02:15.760> car<00:02:16.060> not

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:16.480 
definitely mentioned Sebastian's car not

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:18.330 
definitely mentioned Sebastian's car not
too<00:02:16.690> much<00:02:16.810> other<00:02:17.020> than<00:02:17.140> that<00:02:17.440> as<00:02:17.650> far<00:02:17.890> as<00:02:17.950> like

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:18.340 
too much other than that as far as like

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:21.510 
too much other than that as far as like
saying<00:02:18.670> hey<00:02:19.060> this<00:02:19.240> is<00:02:19.420> the<00:02:19.570> 80s<00:02:20.020> um<00:02:20.260> so<00:02:21.220> I

saying hey this is the 80s um so I

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:23.160 
saying hey this is the 80s um so I
thought<00:02:21.820> that<00:02:22.180> was<00:02:22.330> kind<00:02:22.630> of<00:02:22.720> a<00:02:22.840> different

thought that was kind of a different
twist<00:02:23.380> on<00:02:23.530> things<00:02:23.590> because<00:02:23.890> I<00:02:24.040> know<00:02:24.100> on<00:02:24.310> TV<00:02:24.580> the
