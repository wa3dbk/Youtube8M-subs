00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:03.630
 pereira 

00:00:03.630 --> 00:00:05.010

00:00:05.010 --> 00:00:08.509
 fall 

00:00:08.509 --> 00:00:11.469
 how that could happen it was 

00:00:11.469 --> 00:00:12.290

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:14.279

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:19.739
 the two Benelux countries 

00:00:19.739 --> 00:00:21.480

00:00:27.419 --> 00:00:30.749
 the better it is not that we are hard on after a few days 

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:34.190

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:37.190
 per year daniel morelli 

00:00:38.830 --> 00:00:41.320
 pitcher also a collision 

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:43.800
 we had 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:46.160
 promote death 

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:47.990
 but for 

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:50.580
 there is already a tree 

00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:51.659
 witnesses 2 

00:00:51.659 --> 00:00:52.670

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:55.670
 the six years to years 

00:00:57.150 --> 00:00:58.530
 no 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:00:59.880

00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:02.020
 and on 

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:03.460
 lives 

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:05.560

00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:27.340

 the player group 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:32.560
