00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:20.810
 our hero may be so 

00:00:18.770 --> 00:00:23.420
 strong we can feed him 

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:27.560
 much where to fertilize that it is not 

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:30.079
 calm down and this bud will sprout again 

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:33.350
 and at the end of July at the beginning of August you 

00:00:30.079 --> 00:00:36.170
 will have here an escape what to do in 

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:38.059
 in this case, in this case, and shoots 

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:41.600
 will also appear here in small 

00:00:38.059 --> 00:00:44.120
 shoots 53 centimeters in this case we 

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:49.129
 come and cut our branch 

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:51.260
 over the first runaway counting from here 

00:00:49.129 --> 00:00:54.860
 the base of the branch, that is, if the shoot is 

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:56.989
 here the first escape side we cut century 

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:59.930
 right here let's say our escape right here 

00:00:56.989 --> 00:01:03.530
 we will cut our branch here in this place 

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:05.660
 this is the case as I said 

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:07.910
 if after our pin cheese after 

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:11.240
 pinching above the first sheet in the present 

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:12.880
 we rarely will not rest 

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:18.470
 calm down and be here 

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:20.810
 leaving new shoots means we prune 

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:24.320
 in this case in two or three weeks through 

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:27.140
 month over the first run counting from 

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:30.170
 The base of the branch 

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:32.119
 the first escape we will cut off the escape will 

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:36.400
 here it means here in this place we 

00:01:32.119 --> 00:01:39.009
 cut it like this we will cut 

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:40.850
 then we consider another such option 

00:01:39.009 --> 00:01:46.840
 that was 

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:46.840
 Once the branch is cut on the bud here 

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:54.649
 Here in this place the first kidney sprouted 

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:55.540
 sprouted 2 . 3 already see formed 

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:58.189
 here 

00:01:55.540 --> 00:02:00.759
 fruit formations safely 

00:01:58.189 --> 00:02:04.250
 began to bear fruit fastened already have 

00:02:00.759 --> 00:02:05.930
 Now it will also be fruit so they 

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:07.280
 Formations are already such a kidney 

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:10.459
 tiny 

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:13.510
 naklyulyas means now these shrimp 

00:02:10.459 --> 00:02:15.740
 these two escapes are obvious competitors 

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:19.209
 this should not be here in general 

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:24.950
 can watch the following means if 

00:02:19.209 --> 00:02:26.959
 crown you have such sprawling branches as 

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:30.920
 would not thicken much except not much 

00:02:26.959 --> 00:02:33.319
 climb up means you calmly cut 

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:37.209
 you can cut this thread 

00:02:33.319 --> 00:02:40.090
 its base here here and leave 

00:02:37.209 --> 00:02:42.560
 this one thread 

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:44.680
 heavily thickened strongly vertical 

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:47.600
 crown means in the upper escape cut 

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:51.819
 leave the bottom escape here this one 

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:55.190
 You can apply and apply pin cheeses q 

00:02:51.819 --> 00:02:55.819
 in this case, of course, one is better 

00:02:55.190 --> 00:03:00.769
 from branches 

00:02:55.819 --> 00:03:03.260
 some shorten or remove it altogether 

00:03:00.769 --> 00:03:06.080
 why because they are located friend 

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:08.660
 above each other they interfere with each other the best 

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:10.430
 the arrangement of the branches here is not 

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:12.380
 vertically like this no friend on 

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:12.980
 friend me vertical plane and in 

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:15.260
 plane 

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:17.840
 horizontal here's the perfect location 

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:19.910
 branches such a case the branches are lit 

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:21.739
 they do not interfere with each other but if you are still 

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:25.160
 on move and like that dissolve in 

00:03:21.739 --> 00:03:28.880
 parties about them will be spacious it will be 2 

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:32.420
 need good branches and we will do 

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:34.790
 just because the label 

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:38.510
 sprawling such down close 

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:41.180
 horizontal we just bottom escape in 

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:44.709
 favor top pinch over first 

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:44.709
 a real sheet here 

00:03:56.840 --> 00:03:59.470
 need to go
