King<00:00:43.400> f3<00:00:43.879> so<00:00:44.629> I'm<00:00:44.720> optimistic<00:00:44.960> eat<00:00:45.860> when<00:00:46.100> he<00:00:46.309> is

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:46.370 
King f3 so I'm optimistic eat when he is

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:48.729 
King f3 so I'm optimistic eat when he is
the<00:00:46.549> default<00:00:47.089> now<00:00:47.330> for<00:00:48.080> an<00:00:48.170> attack<00:00:48.500> and

00:00:48.729 --> 00:00:48.739 
the default now for an attack and

00:00:48.739 --> 00:00:50.680 
the default now for an attack and
thinking<00:00:49.040> or<00:00:49.250> might<00:00:49.549> be<00:00:49.640> a<00:00:49.670> better<00:00:50.239> I'll

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:50.690 
thinking or might be a better I'll

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:52.960 
thinking or might be a better I'll
sensing<00:00:51.199> I<00:00:51.379> kind<00:00:52.070> of<00:00:52.100> liked<00:00:52.400> the<00:00:52.610> position<00:00:52.940> a

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:52.970 
sensing I kind of liked the position a

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:55.600 
sensing I kind of liked the position a
lot<00:00:53.089> better<00:00:53.299> than<00:00:53.600> before<00:00:53.890> but<00:00:54.890> even<00:00:55.190> so<00:00:55.460> it's

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:55.610 
lot better than before but even so it's

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:57.579 
lot better than before but even so it's
not<00:00:55.729> really<00:00:55.790> too<00:00:56.720> much<00:00:56.750> to<00:00:56.930> write<00:00:57.260> home<00:00:57.290> about

00:00:57.579 --> 00:00:57.589 
not really too much to write home about

00:00:57.589 --> 00:01:02.469 
not really too much to write home about
so<00:00:58.430> check<00:00:59.019> rook<00:01:00.019> DD<00:01:00.710> 1<00:01:01.059> there's<00:01:02.059> no<00:01:02.210> real

00:01:02.469 --> 00:01:02.479 
so check rook DD 1 there's no real

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:05.140 
so check rook DD 1 there's no real
tactical<00:01:02.979> blast<00:01:03.979> here<00:01:04.280> with<00:01:04.430> my<00:01:04.580> f5<00:01:05.000> or

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:05.150 
tactical blast here with my f5 or

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:08.980 
tactical blast here with my f5 or
anything<00:01:05.510> at<00:01:06.380> the<00:01:06.500> moment<00:01:06.650> and<00:01:07.990> blacks

00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:08.990 
anything at the moment and blacks

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:12.940 
anything at the moment and blacks
position<00:01:09.109> is<00:01:09.590> very<00:01:10.130> good<00:01:10.430> I<00:01:10.700> think<00:01:11.509> so<00:01:12.200> rook<00:01:12.680> G

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:12.950 
position is very good I think so rook G

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:16.899 
position is very good I think so rook G
free<00:01:13.219> rock<00:01:13.460> g8<00:01:14.439> so<00:01:15.439> I<00:01:15.859> didn't<00:01:16.759> know<00:01:16.880> I

00:01:16.899 --> 00:01:16.909 
free rock g8 so I didn't know I

00:01:16.909 --> 00:01:18.219 
free rock g8 so I didn't know I
shouldn't<00:01:17.329> really<00:01:17.630> have<00:01:17.810> played<00:01:18.020> this

00:01:18.219 --> 00:01:18.229 
shouldn't really have played this

00:01:18.229 --> 00:01:20.830 
shouldn't really have played this
perhaps<00:01:18.500> I<00:01:18.829> should<00:01:19.009> have<00:01:19.130> if<00:01:20.060> I<00:01:20.450> was<00:01:20.570> really

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:20.840 
perhaps I should have if I was really

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:26.169 
perhaps I should have if I was really
desperate<00:01:21.049> to<00:01:21.259> win<00:01:21.469> the<00:01:21.679> game<00:01:21.890> um<00:01:22.219> I<00:01:24.880> not<00:01:25.880> not

00:01:26.169 --> 00:01:26.179 
desperate to win the game um I not not

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:28.270 
desperate to win the game um I not not
not<00:01:26.539> doubling<00:01:26.929> up<00:01:27.049> Brooks<00:01:27.259> to<00:01:27.439> just<00:01:27.679> exchanged

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:28.280 
not doubling up Brooks to just exchanged

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:32.469 
not doubling up Brooks to just exchanged
ammaji<00:01:29.079> like<00:01:30.079> I<00:01:30.229> do<00:01:30.289> now<00:01:30.679> with<00:01:31.640> the<00:01:31.820> vague<00:01:32.060> hope

00:01:32.469 --> 00:01:32.479 
ammaji like I do now with the vague hope

00:01:32.479 --> 00:01:34.630 
ammaji like I do now with the vague hope
of<00:01:32.719> trying<00:01:33.020> to<00:01:33.140> get<00:01:33.350> a<00:01:33.380> better<00:01:33.619> night<00:01:34.219> versus

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:34.640 
of trying to get a better night versus

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:36.520 
of trying to get a better night versus
before<00:01:35.030> ending<00:01:35.299> now<00:01:35.450> with<00:01:35.600> this<00:01:35.719> Bishop<00:01:36.079> c5

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:36.530

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:40.419 
before ending now with this Bishop c5
move<00:01:36.999> but<00:01:37.999> he<00:01:38.090> just<00:01:38.210> plays<00:01:38.479> Bishop<00:01:38.719> d8<00:01:39.429> and

00:01:40.419 --> 00:01:40.429

move but he just plays Bishop d8 and
here<00:01:40.820> you<00:01:41.659> see<00:01:41.810> on<00:01:41.990> my<00:01:42.170> left<00:01:42.439> Alex<00:01:43.070> had<00:01:43.219> just

00:01:43.419 --> 00:01:43.429 
here you see on my left Alex had just

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:46.450 
here you see on my left Alex had just
one<00:01:43.820> and<00:01:44.210> on<00:01:44.749> my<00:01:44.929> right<00:01:44.960> and<00:01:45.649> John<00:01:45.950> was<00:01:46.159> a<00:01:46.189> piece

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:46.460 
one and on my right and John was a piece

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:49.539 
one and on my right and John was a piece
up<00:01:46.729> and<00:01:47.030> we<00:01:47.840> had<00:01:48.020> two<00:01:48.259> drawers<00:01:48.590> as<00:01:48.979> well

00:01:49.539 --> 00:01:49.549 
up and we had two drawers as well

00:01:49.549 --> 00:01:52.510 
up and we had two drawers as well
already<00:01:50.079> so<00:01:51.079> basically<00:01:51.649> we<00:01:51.859> were<00:01:51.950> one<00:01:52.159> up<00:01:52.340> in

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:52.520 
already so basically we were one up in

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:55.149 
already so basically we were one up in
the<00:01:52.549> match<00:01:52.819> and<00:01:53.210> I<00:01:53.719> was<00:01:54.289> down<00:01:54.439> to<00:01:54.619> about<00:01:54.649> seven

00:01:55.149 --> 00:01:55.159 
the match and I was down to about seven

00:01:55.159 --> 00:01:58.719 
the match and I was down to about seven
minutes<00:01:55.369> here<00:01:55.819> and<00:01:56.770> pull<00:01:57.770> had<00:01:57.950> about<00:01:58.189> seven

00:01:58.719 --> 00:01:58.729 
minutes here and pull had about seven

00:01:58.729 --> 00:02:00.249 
minutes here and pull had about seven
and<00:01:58.819> a<00:01:58.909> half<00:01:58.939> minutes<00:01:59.359> now<00:01:59.749> I'd<00:01:59.899> actually<00:02:00.049> gone

00:02:00.249 --> 00:02:00.259 
and a half minutes now I'd actually gone

00:02:00.259 --> 00:02:03.609 
and a half minutes now I'd actually gone
to<00:02:00.679> be<00:02:01.280> less<00:02:01.549> time<00:02:01.850> than<00:02:02.060> him<00:02:02.329> I<00:02:02.600> didn't<00:02:03.469> really

00:02:03.609 --> 00:02:03.619 
to be less time than him I didn't really

00:02:03.619 --> 00:02:05.919 
to be less time than him I didn't really
like<00:02:04.130> fancy<00:02:04.639> the<00:02:04.759> position<00:02:05.149> at<00:02:05.270> all<00:02:05.479> here<00:02:05.749> much

00:02:05.919 --> 00:02:05.929 
like fancy the position at all here much

00:02:05.929 --> 00:02:08.320 
like fancy the position at all here much
anyway<00:02:06.350> I<00:02:06.649> thought<00:02:07.249> my<00:02:07.429> only<00:02:07.579> hope<00:02:07.909> maybe

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:08.330 
anyway I thought my only hope maybe

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:10.990 
anyway I thought my only hope maybe
we'll<00:02:08.539> be<00:02:08.690> trying<00:02:08.990> well<00:02:09.319> earlier<00:02:09.880> when<00:02:10.880> I<00:02:10.910> was

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:11.000 
we'll be trying well earlier when I was

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:12.550 
we'll be trying well earlier when I was
looking<00:02:11.360> at<00:02:11.390> is<00:02:11.510> trying<00:02:11.780> to<00:02:11.870> get<00:02:11.990> the<00:02:12.110> king<00:02:12.380> in

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:12.560 
looking at is trying to get the king in

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:17.080 
looking at is trying to get the king in
somehow<00:02:12.890> some<00:02:13.340> infiltration<00:02:14.030> and<00:02:14.950> I<00:02:16.090> think

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:30.620 
within that pawn structure I think here

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:33.229 
within that pawn structure I think here

that's<00:04:31.260> worth<00:04:31.520> investigation<00:04:32.520> maybe<00:04:32.880> in<00:04:33.000> a

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:33.060 
that's worth investigation maybe in a

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:35.060 
that's worth investigation maybe in a
different<00:04:33.180> video<00:04:33.540> so<00:04:34.260> let's<00:04:34.470> let's<00:04:34.710> look<00:04:34.890> at

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:35.070 
different video so let's let's look at

00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:37.430 
different video so let's let's look at
the<00:04:35.160> game<00:04:35.370> again<00:04:35.730> so<00:04:36.060> it<00:04:36.360> was<00:04:36.570> night<00:04:37.170> sea

00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:37.440 
the game again so it was night sea

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:40.640 
the game again so it was night sea
freight<00:04:37.710> which<00:04:37.890> is<00:04:38.840> although<00:04:39.840> successful

00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:40.650 
freight which is although successful

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:42.650 
freight which is although successful
against<00:04:40.950> Paul<00:04:41.130> last<00:04:41.340> year<00:04:41.670> I<00:04:41.850> I<00:04:41.880> couldn't<00:04:42.420> rely

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:42.660 
against Paul last year I I couldn't rely

00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:44.750 
against Paul last year I I couldn't rely
on<00:04:42.720> sea<00:04:42.990> takes<00:04:43.260> the<00:04:43.470> evil<00:04:43.710> being<00:04:43.890> repeated<00:04:44.370> and

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:44.760 
on sea takes the evil being repeated and

00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:48.530 
on sea takes the evil being repeated and
it<00:04:45.060> wasn't<00:04:45.450> so<00:04:45.630> 96<00:04:46.380> more<00:04:46.590> sensible<00:04:47.130> just<00:04:47.910> e6<00:04:48.360> so

00:04:48.530 --> 00:04:48.540 
it wasn't so 96 more sensible just e6 so

00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:49.850 
it wasn't so 96 more sensible just e6 so
it's<00:04:48.690> a<00:04:48.750> French<00:04:48.990> and<00:04:49.260> improved<00:04:49.590> French

00:04:49.850 --> 00:04:49.860 
it's a French and improved French

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:52.130 
it's a French and improved French
defense<00:04:50.280> with<00:04:50.970> this<00:04:51.120> pawn<00:04:51.390> chain<00:04:51.630> much<00:04:51.870> more

00:04:52.130 --> 00:04:52.140 
defense with this pawn chain much more

00:04:52.140 --> 00:04:54.800 
defense with this pawn chain much more
exploitable<00:04:52.860> so<00:04:53.400> much<00:04:53.580> so<00:04:53.820> that<00:04:53.850> I<00:04:54.030> have<00:04:54.630> to

00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:54.810 
exploitable so much so that I have to

00:04:54.810 --> 00:04:57.080 
exploitable so much so that I have to
basically<00:04:55.250> capture<00:04:56.250> away<00:04:56.430> from<00:04:56.670> the<00:04:56.790> center

00:04:57.080 --> 00:04:57.090 
basically capture away from the center

00:04:57.090 --> 00:05:00.620 
basically capture away from the center
and<00:04:57.210> try<00:04:57.480> and<00:04:57.540> hold<00:04:57.870> on<00:04:58.050> to<00:04:58.200> e5<00:04:59.450> but<00:05:00.450> there<00:05:00.600> was

00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:00.630 
and try and hold on to e5 but there was

00:05:00.630 --> 00:05:02.690 
and try and hold on to e5 but there was
there<00:05:01.050> was<00:05:01.140> this<00:05:01.440> tactical<00:05:02.040> idea<00:05:02.520> actually

00:05:02.690 --> 00:05:02.700 
there was this tactical idea actually

00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:04.880 
there was this tactical idea actually
after<00:05:03.210> 9<00:05:03.390> g-7<00:05:03.660> if<00:05:04.110> this<00:05:04.290> lines<00:05:04.560> good<00:05:04.770> actually

00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:04.890 
after 9 g-7 if this lines good actually

00:05:04.890 --> 00:05:09.890

BM may be revived future then night for
here<00:05:10.350> is<00:05:11.390> probably<00:05:12.390> the<00:05:12.630> way<00:05:12.750> to<00:05:12.810> do<00:05:13.110> it<00:05:13.140> try

00:05:13.490 --> 00:05:13.500 
here is probably the way to do it try

00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:16.130 
here is probably the way to do it try
and<00:05:13.590> get<00:05:13.740> rid<00:05:13.860> of<00:05:13.980> that<00:05:14.660> menacing<00:05:15.660> dark<00:05:15.900> square

00:05:16.130 --> 00:05:16.140 
and get rid of that menacing dark square

and get rid of that menacing dark square
Bishop<00:05:16.170> let<00:05:16.650> it<00:05:16.740> go<00:05:16.860> back<00:05:17.100> to<00:05:17.130> c7<00:05:18.320> so<00:05:19.320> there's<00:05:19.740> a

00:05:19.790 --> 00:05:19.800 
Bishop let it go back to c7 so there's a

00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:22.370 
Bishop let it go back to c7 so there's a
tactical<00:05:20.280> idea<00:05:20.610> so<00:05:21.030> um<00:05:21.270> that<00:05:22.080> was<00:05:22.200> mentioned

00:05:22.370 --> 00:05:22.380 
tactical idea so um that was mentioned

00:05:22.380 --> 00:05:25.700 
tactical idea so um that was mentioned
so<00:05:22.800> Bishop<00:05:23.370> d3<00:05:23.700> this<00:05:24.210> is<00:05:24.330> just<00:05:24.540> just<00:05:24.840> simply<00:05:25.380> a

so Bishop d3 this is just just simply a

00:05:25.710 --> 00:05:28.670 
so Bishop d3 this is just just simply a
very<00:05:26.280> bad<00:05:27.050> French<00:05:28.050> defense<00:05:28.350> there<00:05:28.590> are

00:05:28.670 --> 00:05:28.680 
very bad French defense there are
