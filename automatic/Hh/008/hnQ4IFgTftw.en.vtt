00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:00.380 

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:05.390 

now<00:04:01.380> on<00:04:01.590> the<00:04:01.710> air<00:04:01.830> testing<00:04:02.370> I<00:04:02.610> mean<00:04:02.940> I<00:04:03.710> only<00:04:04.710> I

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:05.400 
now on the air testing I mean I only I

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:07.970 
now on the air testing I mean I only I
cut<00:04:05.730> that<00:04:05.910> off<00:04:06.090> about<00:04:06.330> three-quarters<00:04:07.110> so<00:04:07.710> in

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:07.980 
cut that off about three-quarters so in

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:11.120 
cut that off about three-quarters so in
actuality<00:04:09.230> probably<00:04:10.230> about<00:04:10.470> eight<00:04:10.710> inches

actuality probably about eight inches

00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:13.070 
actuality probably about eight inches
deep<00:04:11.190> that<00:04:11.940> will<00:04:12.120> still<00:04:12.390> pick<00:04:12.570> that<00:04:12.750> up<00:04:12.810> all

00:04:13.070 --> 00:04:13.080 
deep that will still pick that up all

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:20.710 
deep that will still pick that up all
easy<00:04:13.910> so<00:04:14.910> I<00:04:17.780> found<00:04:18.780> a<00:04:19.520> North<00:04:20.520> American

summer<00:04:40.410> I'm<00:04:40.770> hoping<00:04:41.550> to<00:04:41.760> find<00:04:42.120> some<00:04:42.390> really

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:42.570 
summer I'm hoping to find some really

00:04:42.570 --> 00:04:45.680 
summer I'm hoping to find some really
good<00:04:42.690> stuff<00:04:42.870> with<00:04:43.290> it<00:04:43.440> it<00:04:44.340> runs<00:04:44.580> at<00:04:44.730> 12.5

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:45.690 
good stuff with it it runs at 12.5

00:04:45.690 --> 00:04:51.200 
good stuff with it it runs at 12.5
kilohertz<00:04:49.190> basically<00:04:50.190> it's<00:04:50.460> sort<00:04:50.700> of<00:04:50.820> like<00:04:50.970> a

00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:51.210 
kilohertz basically it's sort of like a

00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:55.659 
kilohertz basically it's sort of like a
Fisher<00:04:52.310> 1270<00:04:53.310> and<00:04:53.700> a<00:04:53.850> Tesoro<00:04:54.660> taeyeon

00:04:55.659 --> 00:04:55.669 
Fisher 1270 and a Tesoro taeyeon

00:04:55.669 --> 00:05:00.550 
Fisher 1270 and a Tesoro taeyeon
combined<00:04:58.669> with
