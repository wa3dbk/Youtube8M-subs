00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:07.030 
and the green although I do wish the
purple<00:02:06.050> was<00:02:06.230> a<00:02:06.260> little<00:02:06.530> bit<00:02:06.620> darker<00:02:06.740> but

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:07.040

00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:50.810 
II type of color when we go in the shade

00:05:50.810 --> 00:05:53.290 
II type of color when we go in the shade
and<00:05:51.139> at<00:05:51.289> nighttime<00:05:51.590> it<00:05:52.159> the<00:05:52.669> red<00:05:52.909> really

00:05:53.290 --> 00:05:53.300 
and at nighttime it the red really

00:05:53.300 --> 00:05:55.300 
and at nighttime it the red really
stands<00:05:53.659> out<00:05:53.870> and<00:05:54.110> it's<00:05:54.650> kind<00:05:54.860> of<00:05:55.009> like<00:05:55.129> a

00:05:55.300 --> 00:05:55.310 
stands out and it's kind of like a

00:05:55.310 --> 00:05:57.159 
stands out and it's kind of like a
double<00:05:55.639> colored<00:05:56.210> car<00:05:56.539> if<00:05:56.689> that<00:05:56.840> makes<00:05:57.050> any

00:05:57.159 --> 00:05:57.169 
double colored car if that makes any

00:05:57.169 --> 00:05:58.360 
double colored car if that makes any
sense<00:05:57.259> you<00:05:57.590> know<00:05:57.680> when<00:05:58.069> you're<00:05:58.219> in<00:05:58.249> the

00:05:58.360 --> 00:05:58.370 
sense you know when you're in the

00:05:58.370 --> 00:05:59.980 
sense you know when you're in the
sunlight<00:05:58.699> it's<00:05:58.879> one<00:05:59.150> color<00:05:59.419> and<00:05:59.629> then<00:05:59.779> when

00:05:59.980 --> 00:05:59.990 
sunlight it's one color and then when

00:05:59.990 --> 00:06:01.480 
sunlight it's one color and then when
you<00:06:00.080> go<00:06:00.229> in<00:06:00.349> the<00:06:00.469> shade<00:06:00.680> or<00:06:01.009> at<00:06:01.189> nighttime

00:06:01.480 --> 00:06:01.490 
you go in the shade or at nighttime

00:06:01.490 --> 00:06:03.820 
you go in the shade or at nighttime
eight<00:06:02.060> turns<00:06:02.419> completely<00:06:02.719> different<00:06:03.560> so<00:06:03.800> that

00:06:03.820 --> 00:06:03.830 
eight turns completely different so that

00:06:03.830 --> 00:06:55.670 
eight turns completely different so that
is<00:06:03.979> why<00:06:04.250> I<00:06:04.279> really<00:06:05.210> do<00:06:05.330> like<00:06:05.539> this<00:06:05.750> color

00:06:55.670 --> 00:06:55.680 

00:06:55.680 --> 00:06:57.200 

but<00:06:56.340> that<00:06:56.520> is<00:06:56.639> pretty<00:06:56.729> much<00:06:56.850> it<00:06:56.940> with<00:06:57.090> this

00:06:57.200 --> 00:06:57.210 
but that is pretty much it with this

00:06:57.210 --> 00:06:59.420 
but that is pretty much it with this
