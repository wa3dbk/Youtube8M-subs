00:02:34.809 --> 00:02:34.819 
cutting so you're having to do kind of a

00:02:34.819 --> 00:02:38.410 
cutting so you're having to do kind of a
circular<00:02:35.150> motion<00:02:36.579> but<00:02:37.579> with<00:02:37.790> a<00:02:37.819> completely

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:38.420 
circular motion but with a completely

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:42.099 
circular motion but with a completely
straight<00:02:38.959> edge<00:02:39.230> like<00:02:39.590> that<00:02:40.269> it's<00:02:41.269> it's<00:02:41.750> kind

00:02:42.099 --> 00:02:42.109 
straight edge like that it's it's kind

00:02:42.109 --> 00:02:53.699 
straight edge like that it's it's kind
of<00:02:42.230> uh<00:02:42.459> it's<00:02:43.459> kind<00:02:43.760> of<00:02:43.819> relentless

00:02:53.699 --> 00:02:53.709 

00:02:53.709 --> 00:02:56.110 

so<00:02:54.709> I<00:02:54.739> think<00:02:54.859> this<00:02:55.189> would<00:02:55.340> be<00:02:55.370> an<00:02:55.609> excellent

00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:56.120 
so I think this would be an excellent

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:58.179 
so I think this would be an excellent
you<00:02:56.450> know<00:02:56.480> folding<00:02:57.079> knife<00:02:57.260> replacement<00:02:57.980> for

00:02:58.179 --> 00:02:58.189 
you know folding knife replacement for

00:02:58.189 --> 00:03:00.039 
you know folding knife replacement for
just<00:02:58.370> a<00:02:58.459> cheapo<00:02:58.849> box<00:02:59.150> cutter<00:02:59.510> I<00:02:59.599> would

00:03:00.039 --> 00:03:00.049 
just a cheapo box cutter I would

00:03:00.049 --> 00:03:02.500 
just a cheapo box cutter I would
definitely<00:03:00.500> rather<00:03:00.680> have<00:03:01.010> this<00:03:01.480> you<00:03:02.480> know

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:02.510 
definitely rather have this you know

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:06.069 
definitely rather have this you know
than<00:03:02.810> a<00:03:02.840> box<00:03:03.169> cutter<00:03:04.510> all<00:03:05.510> right<00:03:05.659> here's<00:03:05.989> a

00:03:06.069 --> 00:03:06.079 
than a box cutter all right here's a

00:03:06.079 --> 00:03:07.839 
than a box cutter all right here's a
size<00:03:06.349> comparison<00:03:06.590> with<00:03:07.220> a<00:03:07.250> very<00:03:07.519> similar

00:03:07.839 --> 00:03:07.849 
size comparison with a very similar

00:03:07.849 --> 00:03:10.629 
size comparison with a very similar
knife<00:03:08.239> this<00:03:08.959> is<00:03:09.019> also<00:03:09.349> a<00:03:09.500> Meyer<00:03:09.829> Co<00:03:10.129> folding

00:03:10.629 --> 00:03:10.639 
knife this is also a Meyer Co folding

00:03:10.639 --> 00:03:13.479 
knife this is also a Meyer Co folding
knife<00:03:10.900> this<00:03:11.900> is<00:03:12.079> this<00:03:12.409> is<00:03:12.590> basically<00:03:12.919> the<00:03:13.159> hawk

00:03:13.479 --> 00:03:13.489 
knife this is this is basically the hawk

00:03:13.489 --> 00:03:16.990 
knife this is this is basically the hawk
Bill<00:03:13.819> version<00:03:14.510> they're<00:03:14.900> very<00:03:15.200> similar<00:03:16.000> except

00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:17.000 
Bill version they're very similar except

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.240 
Bill version they're very similar except
the<00:03:17.180> hawk<00:03:17.419> bill<00:03:17.720> you<00:03:18.560> know<00:03:18.680> obviously<00:03:19.010> there's

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:19.250 
the hawk bill you know obviously there's

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:21.039 
the hawk bill you know obviously there's
a<00:03:19.280> hawk<00:03:19.519> Bill<00:03:19.729> instead<00:03:20.120> of<00:03:20.239> the<00:03:20.359> Warren<00:03:20.659> Cliff

00:03:21.039 --> 00:03:21.049 
a hawk Bill instead of the Warren Cliff

00:03:21.049 --> 00:03:25.270 
a hawk Bill instead of the Warren Cliff
and<00:03:21.349> the<00:03:21.859> handle<00:03:22.310> design<00:03:23.349> it<00:03:24.349> looks<00:03:24.680> like<00:03:24.919> I

00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:25.280 
and the handle design it looks like I

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:27.909 
and the handle design it looks like I
believe<00:03:25.669> that's<00:03:26.000> the<00:03:26.599> handle<00:03:27.379> type<00:03:27.620> of<00:03:27.829> a

00:03:27.909 --> 00:03:27.919 
believe that's the handle type of a

00:03:27.919 --> 00:03:31.780 
believe that's the handle type of a
swayback<00:03:28.449> pocketknife<00:03:30.250> if<00:03:31.250> you<00:03:31.430> know<00:03:31.549> about

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:31.790 
swayback pocketknife if you know about

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:33.729 
swayback pocketknife if you know about
slip<00:03:32.150> joints<00:03:32.599> I<00:03:32.690> believe<00:03:32.930> that's<00:03:33.169> a<00:03:33.290> swayback

00:03:33.729 --> 00:03:33.739 
slip joints I believe that's a swayback

00:03:33.739 --> 00:03:36.969 
slip joints I believe that's a swayback
style<00:03:34.430> handle<00:03:35.139> right<00:03:36.139> but<00:03:36.290> I<00:03:36.409> actually<00:03:36.530> like

00:03:36.969 --> 00:03:36.979 
style handle right but I actually like

00:03:36.979 --> 00:03:39.819 
style handle right but I actually like
the<00:03:37.159> more<00:03:37.400> simple<00:03:37.909> handle<00:03:38.329> of<00:03:38.540> of<00:03:39.229> the<00:03:39.440> bottom

00:03:39.819 --> 00:03:39.829 
the more simple handle of of the bottom

00:03:39.829 --> 00:03:41.860 
the more simple handle of of the bottom
knife<00:03:40.180> all<00:03:41.180> right<00:03:41.329> but<00:03:41.479> if<00:03:41.569> you<00:03:41.690> want

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:41.870 
knife all right but if you want

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:44.050 
knife all right but if you want
something<00:03:42.290> like<00:03:42.500> this<00:03:42.709> in<00:03:42.889> a<00:03:42.979> hawk<00:03:43.190> bill<00:03:43.489> and

00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:44.060 
something like this in a hawk bill and

something like this in a hawk bill and
I'll<00:03:44.209> check<00:03:44.419> out<00:03:44.629> my<00:03:44.840> review<00:03:44.900> of<00:03:45.319> the<00:03:45.560> top

00:03:45.789 --> 00:03:45.799 
I'll check out my review of the top

00:03:45.799 --> 00:03:49.569 
I'll check out my review of the top
knife<00:03:46.269> but<00:03:47.269> they're<00:03:47.419> both<00:03:47.599> pretty<00:03:47.840> handy<00:03:48.579> all

00:03:49.569 --> 00:03:49.579 
knife but they're both pretty handy all

00:03:49.579 --> 00:03:51.610 
knife but they're both pretty handy all
right<00:03:49.729> and<00:03:49.940> here's<00:03:50.150> another<00:03:50.329> size<00:03:50.840> comparison

00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:51.620 
right and here's another size comparison

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:53.770 
right and here's another size comparison
that<00:03:51.650> is<00:03:51.829> my<00:03:52.099> spider<00:03:52.519> coat<00:03:52.819> delicous<00:03:53.419> sprint

00:03:53.770 --> 00:03:53.780 
that is my spider coat delicous sprint

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:56.199 
that is my spider coat delicous sprint
run<00:03:54.019> but<00:03:54.919> you<00:03:55.370> know<00:03:55.459> most<00:03:55.729> people<00:03:55.909> are

00:03:56.199 --> 00:03:56.209 
run but you know most people are

00:03:56.209 --> 00:03:59.649 
run but you know most people are
familiar<00:03:56.479> with<00:03:56.840> the<00:03:57.409> basic<00:03:58.180> proportions<00:03:59.180> of<00:03:59.569> a

00:03:59.649 --> 00:03:59.659 
familiar with the basic proportions of a

00:03:59.659 --> 00:04:02.110 
familiar with the basic proportions of a
delica<00:04:00.199> so<00:04:00.979> as<00:04:01.129> you<00:04:01.310> can<00:04:01.489> see<00:04:01.699> they're<00:04:01.909> you

00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:02.120 
delica so as you can see they're you

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:05.080 
delica so as you can see they're you
know<00:04:02.150> it's<00:04:02.449> around<00:04:02.900> the<00:04:03.799> same<00:04:04.129> overall<00:04:04.790> length

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:05.090 
know it's around the same overall length

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:09.099 
know it's around the same overall length
when<00:04:05.449> open<00:04:05.959> as<00:04:06.109> the<00:04:06.769> delica<00:04:07.689> and<00:04:08.689> when<00:04:08.959> it's

00:04:09.099 --> 00:04:09.109 
when open as the delica and when it's

00:04:09.109 --> 00:04:11.860 
when open as the delica and when it's
closed<00:04:09.530> right<00:04:10.040> the<00:04:10.790> handle<00:04:11.150> is<00:04:11.269> even<00:04:11.540> smaller

00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:11.870 
closed right the handle is even smaller

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:14.679 
closed right the handle is even smaller
than<00:04:11.989> on<00:04:12.229> the<00:04:12.349> delicate<00:04:12.829> so<00:04:13.430> this<00:04:13.879> is<00:04:14.090> truly<00:04:14.509> a

00:04:14.679 --> 00:04:14.689 
than on the delicate so this is truly a

00:04:14.689 --> 00:04:17.439 
than on the delicate so this is truly a
very<00:04:15.009> very<00:04:16.009> light<00:04:16.280> and<00:04:16.459> handy<00:04:16.669> sized<00:04:17.090> little

00:04:17.439 --> 00:04:17.449 
very very light and handy sized little

00:04:17.449 --> 00:04:19.810 
very very light and handy sized little
knife<00:04:18.070> alright<00:04:19.070> and<00:04:19.280> another<00:04:19.370> size

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:19.820 
knife alright and another size

00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:22.600 
knife alright and another size

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:22.610 
comparison with another Warren cliff all

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:23.830 
comparison with another Warren cliff all
right<00:04:22.729> you<00:04:22.880> see<00:04:23.090> the<00:04:23.240> difference<00:04:23.630> there

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:23.840 
right you see the difference there

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:25.469
