surround 202 I messed

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:15.259 
surround 202 I messed
because<00:02:13.920> I<00:02:14.040> went<00:02:14.220> over<00:02:14.340> to<00:02:14.400> look<00:02:14.610> at<00:02:14.730> skype<00:02:15.000> and

00:02:15.259 --> 00:02:15.269 
because I went over to look at skype and

00:02:15.269 --> 00:02:17.000 
because I went over to look at skype and
I<00:02:15.330> wasn't<00:02:15.660> using<00:02:15.840> any<00:02:16.019> abilities<00:02:16.530> or<00:02:16.650> anything

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:17.010 
I wasn't using any abilities or anything

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:19.699 
I wasn't using any abilities or anything
just<00:02:17.670> relying<00:02:18.060> on<00:02:18.239> my<00:02:18.360> temples<00:02:18.780> and<00:02:19.019> mid<00:02:19.470> more

00:02:19.699 --> 00:02:19.709 
just relying on my temples and mid more

00:02:19.709 --> 00:02:22.430 
just relying on my temples and mid more
than<00:02:19.920> like<00:02:20.129> massive<00:02:20.550> damage<00:02:20.790> stuff<00:02:21.209> and<00:02:21.480> that

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:22.440 
than like massive damage stuff and that

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:24.790 
than like massive damage stuff and that
did<00:02:22.860> not<00:02:22.890> work<00:02:23.040> too<00:02:23.430> well<00:02:23.510> so<00:02:24.510> yeah<00:02:24.540> I

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:24.800 
did not work too well so yeah I

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:27.199 
did not work too well so yeah I
recommend<00:02:25.800> getting<00:02:26.069> up<00:02:26.340> some<00:02:26.580> support<00:02:26.910> hours

00:02:27.199 --> 00:02:27.209 
recommend getting up some support hours

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:30.979 
recommend getting up some support hours
before<00:02:27.660> around<00:02:27.870> 200<00:02:28.500> because<00:02:28.920> yeah<00:02:29.989> they'll

00:02:30.979 --> 00:02:30.989 
before around 200 because yeah they'll

00:02:30.989 --> 00:02:33.140 
before around 200 because yeah they'll
start<00:02:31.260> gay<00:02:31.410> that's<00:02:31.650> not<00:02:31.769> to<00:02:31.860> ramp<00:02:32.040> up<00:02:32.190> that

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:33.150 
start gay that's not to ramp up that

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:35.420 
start gay that's not to ramp up that
being<00:02:33.390> said<00:02:33.750> though<00:02:34.080> I<00:02:34.410> think<00:02:35.099> it's<00:02:35.220> too<00:02:35.400> easy

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:35.430 
being said though I think it's too easy

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:37.820 
being said though I think it's too easy
at<00:02:35.879> the<00:02:35.940> moment<00:02:36.360> I<00:02:36.480> mean<00:02:36.840> I<00:02:36.870> lost<00:02:37.170> them<00:02:37.410> 200

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:37.830 
at the moment I mean I lost them 200

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:39.500 
at the moment I mean I lost them 200
because<00:02:38.010> I<00:02:38.099> was<00:02:38.220> being<00:02:38.340> a<00:02:38.459> bit<00:02:38.580> foolish<00:02:39.060> I

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:39.510 
because I was being a bit foolish I

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:41.270 
because I was being a bit foolish I
wasn't<00:02:40.110> really<00:02:40.200> paying<00:02:40.440> attention<00:02:40.590> but<00:02:41.220> I

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:41.280 
wasn't really paying attention but I

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:43.280 
wasn't really paying attention but I
reckon<00:02:41.790> I<00:02:41.879> could<00:02:41.940> have<00:02:42.180> easily<00:02:42.330> gone<00:02:42.900> a<00:02:43.140> lot

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:43.290 
reckon I could have easily gone a lot

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:45.770 
reckon I could have easily gone a lot
higher<00:02:43.530> and<00:02:43.920> it<00:02:44.640> didn't<00:02:44.970> yeah<00:02:45.239> it<00:02:45.510> didn't

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:45.780 
higher and it didn't yeah it didn't

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:47.420 
higher and it didn't yeah it didn't
really<00:02:45.870> take<00:02:45.959> me<00:02:46.260> that<00:02:46.709> much<00:02:46.739> effort<00:02:47.040> to<00:02:47.190> get

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:47.430 
really take me that much effort to get

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:49.339 
really take me that much effort to get
to<00:02:47.549> where<00:02:47.640> I<00:02:47.700> was<00:02:47.880> honestly<00:02:48.870> I<00:02:48.959> was<00:02:49.170> just

00:02:49.339 --> 00:02:49.349 
to where I was honestly I was just

00:02:49.349 --> 00:02:52.100 
to where I was honestly I was just
chatting<00:02:49.920> on<00:02:50.099> skype<00:02:50.420> did<00:02:51.420> not<00:02:51.690> pay<00:02:51.959> much

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:52.110 
chatting on skype did not pay much

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:53.630 
chatting on skype did not pay much
attention<00:02:52.560> at<00:02:52.650> all<00:02:52.680> besides<00:02:52.950> just<00:02:53.340> starting

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:53.640 
attention at all besides just starting

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:56.479 
attention at all besides just starting
the<00:02:53.700> next<00:02:53.819> round<00:02:54.920> so<00:02:55.920> hopefully<00:02:56.280> that<00:02:56.430> will

00:02:56.479 --> 00:02:56.489 
the next round so hopefully that will

00:02:56.489 --> 00:02:58.069 
the next round so hopefully that will
make<00:02:56.700> make<00:02:57.209> it<00:02:57.239> a<00:02:57.360> bit<00:02:57.510> harder<00:02:57.930> because

00:02:58.069 --> 00:02:58.079 
make make it a bit harder because

00:02:58.079 --> 00:03:00.380 
make make it a bit harder because
honestly<00:02:58.890> I<00:02:58.980> don't<00:02:59.099> want<00:02:59.280> to<00:02:59.340> be<00:02:59.430> sitting<00:03:00.150> here

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:00.390 
honestly I don't want to be sitting here

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:02.449 
honestly I don't want to be sitting here
each<00:03:00.599> day<00:03:00.629> for<00:03:00.989> hours<00:03:01.379> and<00:03:01.680> hours<00:03:01.799> setting<00:03:02.280> a

00:03:02.449 --> 00:03:02.459 
each day for hours and hours setting a

00:03:02.459 --> 00:03:05.839 
each day for hours and hours setting a
score<00:03:02.760> of<00:03:02.879> like<00:03:03.829> 612,000<00:03:04.829> because<00:03:05.519> that<00:03:05.700> looks

00:03:05.839 --> 00:03:05.849 
score of like 612,000 because that looks

00:03:05.849 --> 00:03:07.369 
score of like 612,000 because that looks
like<00:03:06.060> it<00:03:06.239> might<00:03:06.269> be<00:03:06.480> possible<00:03:06.629> at<00:03:07.019> this<00:03:07.110> rate

00:03:07.369 --> 00:03:07.379 
like it might be possible at this rate

00:03:07.379 --> 00:03:11.780 
like it might be possible at this rate
and<00:03:08.870> if<00:03:09.870> we're<00:03:10.110> getting<00:03:10.590> because<00:03:11.310> on<00:03:11.489> it<00:03:11.610> like

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:11.790 
and if we're getting because on it like

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:14.330 
and if we're getting because on it like
it<00:03:12.030> is<00:03:12.450> harder<00:03:13.019> to<00:03:13.049> progress<00:03:13.620> here<00:03:13.950> than<00:03:14.190> it<00:03:14.310> is

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:14.340 
it is harder to progress here than it is

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:16.430 
it is harder to progress here than it is
in<00:03:14.459> bloom<00:03:14.910> stuffins<00:03:15.329> 50<00:03:15.750> got<00:03:15.930> vengeful

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:16.440 
in bloom stuffins 50 got vengeful

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:19.099 
in bloom stuffins 50 got vengeful
temples<00:03:16.739> here<00:03:16.860> which<00:03:17.129> is<00:03:17.310> like<00:03:17.519> insane<00:03:18.450> there

00:03:19.099 --> 00:03:19.109 
temples here which is like insane there

00:03:19.109 --> 00:03:20.300 
temples here which is like insane there
are<00:03:19.230> a<00:03:19.290> lot<00:03:19.440> more<00:03:19.470> powerful<00:03:19.859> than<00:03:20.100> regular

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:20.310 
are a lot more powerful than regular

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:23.289 
are a lot more powerful than regular
temples<00:03:20.880> so<00:03:21.120> that<00:03:21.690> makes<00:03:21.870> a<00:03:21.930> big<00:03:22.049> difference

00:03:23.289 --> 00:03:23.299 
temples so that makes a big difference

00:03:23.299 --> 00:03:25.460

00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:59.900 
have to be moderated by the admins which
i<00:03:56.280> think<00:03:56.340> is<00:03:56.549> good<00:03:56.900> because<00:03:57.900> that<00:03:58.910> moderating

00:03:59.900 --> 00:03:59.910

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:05.880 
I think I think it's a bit too much work

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:06.860 
I think I think it's a bit too much work
