so whenever you practice hands separate

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:53.469 
so whenever you practice hands separate
make<00:01:52.220> sure<00:01:52.430> you<00:01:52.580> have<00:01:52.759> both<00:01:52.790> hands<00:01:53.300> on<00:01:53.420> the

00:01:56.230 --> 00:01:56.240 
piano so that's the first step make sure

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:58.240 
piano so that's the first step make sure
you<00:01:56.360> have<00:01:56.570> each<00:01:56.780> hand<00:01:57.140> solid<00:01:57.649> a<00:01:57.770> lot<00:01:57.920> of<00:01:58.009> people

you have each hand solid a lot of people

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:00.639 
you have each hand solid a lot of people
don't<00:01:58.580> they<00:01:58.940> have<00:01:59.119> it<00:01:59.330> kind<00:02:00.080> of<00:02:00.200> solid<00:02:00.560> but

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:02.720 
it's a little sloppy and if each hand is

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:04.090 
it's a little sloppy and if each hand is
a<00:02:02.780> little<00:02:03.020> bit<00:02:03.110> sloppy<00:02:03.409> when<00:02:03.649> you<00:02:03.710> try<00:02:03.890> to<00:02:03.920> put

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:04.100 
a little bit sloppy when you try to put

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:05.469 
a little bit sloppy when you try to put
them<00:02:04.190> together<00:02:04.310> it's<00:02:04.670> not<00:02:04.759> going<00:02:05.030> to<00:02:05.090> match<00:02:05.240> up

00:02:05.469 --> 00:02:05.479 
them together it's not going to match up

00:02:05.479 --> 00:02:07.090 
them together it's not going to match up
and<00:02:05.600> it's<00:02:05.780> going<00:02:05.869> to<00:02:05.960> freak<00:02:06.170> you<00:02:06.259> up<00:02:06.440> so<00:02:06.950> that's

00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:10.160 
step one all right on to step two so now

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:11.860 
step one all right on to step two so now
that<00:02:10.369> you<00:02:10.519> can<00:02:10.670> play<00:02:10.850> right<00:02:11.239> hand<00:02:11.480> and<00:02:11.660> left

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:17.930 
work on getting hands together getting

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:20.890 
work on getting hands together getting
the<00:02:18.050> rhythm<00:02:19.030> solid<00:02:20.030> before<00:02:20.269> we<00:02:20.660> even<00:02:20.780> think

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:20.900 
the rhythm solid before we even think

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:22.449 
the rhythm solid before we even think
about<00:02:21.230> adding<00:02:21.620> the<00:02:21.709> melody<00:02:21.980> because<00:02:22.160> if<00:02:22.280> you

00:02:22.449 --> 00:02:22.459 
about adding the melody because if you

00:02:22.459 --> 00:02:24.490 
about adding the melody because if you
can't<00:02:22.670> do<00:02:22.790> the<00:02:22.910> rhythm<00:02:23.180> by<00:02:23.269> itself<00:02:23.630> there's<00:02:24.290> no

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:24.500 
can't do the rhythm by itself there's no

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:25.600 
can't do the rhythm by itself there's no
way<00:02:24.739> you're<00:02:24.920> going<00:02:25.040> to<00:02:25.100> be<00:02:25.160> able<00:02:25.220> to<00:02:25.340> add<00:02:25.489> the

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:25.610 
way you're going to be able to add the

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:28.840 
way you're going to be able to add the
melody<00:02:25.940> so<00:02:26.569> to<00:02:26.630> develop<00:02:27.019> this<00:02:27.260> we<00:02:28.190> tap<00:02:28.580> the

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:28.850 
melody so to develop this we tap the

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:31.150 
melody so to develop this we tap the
rhythm<00:02:29.140> with<00:02:30.140> our<00:02:30.319> hands<00:02:30.709> we<00:02:30.769> don't<00:02:31.010> worry

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:31.160 
rhythm with our hands we don't worry

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:32.860 
rhythm with our hands we don't worry
about<00:02:31.310> the<00:02:31.430> melody<00:02:31.730> all<00:02:31.880> we<00:02:32.060> focus<00:02:32.239> on<00:02:32.600> is<00:02:32.750> the

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:32.870 
about the melody all we focus on is the

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:34.780 
about the melody all we focus on is the
rhythm<00:02:33.019> so<00:02:33.769> for<00:02:33.950> this<00:02:34.069> song<00:02:34.280> it<00:02:34.519> would<00:02:34.610> sound

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:34.790 
rhythm so for this song it would sound

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:47.199 
rhythm so for this song it would sound
something<00:02:34.970> like<00:02:35.150> this<00:02:44.739> and<00:02:45.739> if<00:02:46.640> you<00:02:46.760> can't<00:02:47.000> get

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:49.400 
the rhythm on the first try like that

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:51.850

00:03:07.210 --> 00:03:07.220 
melody so that's step two is rhythm now

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:09.250 
melody so that's step two is rhythm now
on<00:03:07.370> to<00:03:07.459> step<00:03:07.519> three<00:03:07.880> now<00:03:08.359> step<00:03:08.660> three<00:03:09.019> is

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:09.260 
on to step three now step three is

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:12.310 
on to step three now step three is
taking<00:03:09.890> very<00:03:10.220> small<00:03:10.609> sections<00:03:11.180> of<00:03:11.420> the<00:03:12.109> song

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:12.320 
taking very small sections of the song

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:14.920 
taking very small sections of the song
and<00:03:12.650> then<00:03:13.130> adding<00:03:13.640> notes<00:03:13.880> to<00:03:14.269> those<00:03:14.390> sections
