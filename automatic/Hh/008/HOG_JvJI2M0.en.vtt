notice that i'll put a link it I'll put
the<00:03:14.079> seed<00:03:14.319> in<00:03:14.350> the<00:03:14.530> description<00:03:15.010> for<00:03:15.220> it<00:03:15.370> um

00:03:15.539 --> 00:03:15.549 
the seed in the description for it um

00:03:15.549 --> 00:03:18.990 
the seed in the description for it um
I've<00:03:15.970> never<00:03:16.420> seen<00:03:16.659> anything<00:03:16.959> like<00:03:17.110> it

um<00:03:20.640> so<00:03:21.640> put<00:03:21.880> the<00:03:21.970> seed<00:03:22.180> in<00:03:22.210> description<00:03:22.840> and

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:23.110 
um so put the seed in description and

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:27.060 
um so put the seed in description and
the<00:03:23.140> coordinates<00:03:24.030> so<00:03:25.030> um<00:03:25.300> I<00:03:25.630> don't<00:03:26.170> know<00:03:26.350> this

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:27.070 
the coordinates so um I don't know this

00:03:27.070 --> 00:03:30.000 
the coordinates so um I don't know this
seat<00:03:27.430> is<00:03:27.460> just<00:03:27.880> weird<00:03:28.180> I've<00:03:28.960> already<00:03:29.200> seen<00:03:29.620> a

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:30.010 
seat is just weird I've already seen a

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:32.820 
seat is just weird I've already seen a
sand<00:03:30.460> pyramid<00:03:31.030> and<00:03:31.960> you<00:03:32.110> know<00:03:32.200> those<00:03:32.350> bum

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:32.830 
sand pyramid and you know those bum

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:36.449 
sand pyramid and you know those bum
pyramids<00:03:33.370> and<00:03:33.670> little<00:03:33.970> ponds<00:03:34.420> and<00:03:35.190> water<00:03:36.190> and

00:03:36.449 --> 00:03:36.459 
pyramids and little ponds and water and

00:03:36.459 --> 00:03:39.180 
pyramids and little ponds and water and
the<00:03:36.730> water<00:03:36.880> so<00:03:37.360> I'm<00:03:38.350> in<00:03:38.560> one<00:03:38.740> point<00:03:38.950> two<00:03:39.070> point

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:39.190 
the water so I'm in one point two point

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:44.520 
the water so I'm in one point two point
five<00:03:39.400> and<00:03:40.290> it's<00:03:41.290> pretty<00:03:41.560> strange<00:03:42.900> so<00:03:43.900> I'm<00:03:44.080> the

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:44.530 
five and it's pretty strange so I'm the

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:46.140 
five and it's pretty strange so I'm the
reason<00:03:44.680> you're<00:03:45.459> also<00:03:45.670> going<00:03:45.910> to<00:03:45.970> need<00:03:46.030> a

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:46.150 
reason you're also going to need a

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:48.300 
reason you're also going to need a
diamond<00:03:46.480> shovel<00:03:46.780> the<00:03:47.290> reason<00:03:47.560> you're<00:03:47.709> using<00:03:48.160> a

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:48.310 
diamond shovel the reason you're using a

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:52.460 
diamond shovel the reason you're using a
diamond<00:03:48.640> shovel<00:03:49.000> is<00:03:49.120> because<00:03:49.330> it's<00:03:49.480> faster<00:03:49.800> um

00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:52.470 
diamond shovel is because it's faster um

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:55.800 
diamond shovel is because it's faster um
you're<00:03:53.470> going<00:03:53.650> to<00:03:53.709> day<00:03:53.830> down<00:03:54.040> three<00:03:54.550> and<00:03:55.090> then

00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:55.810 
you're going to day down three and then

00:03:55.810 --> 00:04:02.190 
you're going to day down three and then
make<00:03:55.989> a<00:03:56.020> staircase<00:03:56.640> forget<00:03:57.640> it<00:03:57.670> back<00:03:57.820> up<00:04:01.200> then

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:02.200 
make a staircase forget it back up then

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:07.590 
make a staircase forget it back up then
I'll<00:04:03.130> make<00:04:03.370> my<00:04:03.520> four<00:04:03.760> stone<00:04:04.920> so<00:04:05.920> uh<00:04:06.180> so<00:04:07.180> the

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:07.600 
I'll make my four stone so uh so the

00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:09.090 
I'll make my four stone so uh so the
stone<00:04:07.780> for<00:04:08.110> light<00:04:08.380> you<00:04:08.500> know<00:04:08.650> that<00:04:08.890> you're

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:09.100 
stone for light you know that you're

00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:12.420 
stone for light you know that you're
just<00:04:09.880> keep<00:04:10.120> digging<00:04:10.300> until<00:04:10.680> it<00:04:11.680> ends<00:04:12.100> then<00:04:12.370> you

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:12.430 
just keep digging until it ends then you

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:15.420 
just keep digging until it ends then you
compass<00:04:12.840> until<00:04:13.840> the<00:04:14.050> stone<00:04:14.290> ends<00:04:14.620> so<00:04:15.160> then

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:15.430 
compass until the stone ends so then

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:23.420 
compass until the stone ends so then
you're<00:04:15.550> going<00:04:15.640> to<00:04:15.700> put<00:04:15.940> santi<00:04:16.630> there<00:04:17.970> dig<00:04:19.200> dig

00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:23.430 

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:30.120 

okay<00:04:24.570> and<00:04:26.610> do<00:04:27.610> it<00:04:27.729> some<00:04:27.880> more<00:04:27.910> time<00:04:28.890> funk<00:04:29.890> all

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:30.130 
okay and do it some more time funk all

00:04:30.130 --> 00:04:35.530 
okay and do it some more time funk all
crap

00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:35.540 

00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:39.159 

it<00:04:36.540> scares<00:04:36.930> the<00:04:37.080> crap<00:04:37.199> out<00:04:37.500> of<00:04:37.530> me<00:04:37.710> one<00:04:37.919> my<00:04:38.100> um

00:04:39.159 --> 00:04:39.169 
it scares the crap out of me one my um

00:04:39.169 --> 00:04:43.250 
it scares the crap out of me one my um
shovel<00:04:40.169> breaks<00:04:41.600> because<00:04:42.600> it's<00:04:42.930> about<00:04:43.139> the

00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:43.260 
shovel breaks because it's about the

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:50.450 
shovel breaks because it's about the
break<00:04:43.440> I<00:04:43.590> know<00:04:43.650> it<00:04:43.889> is<00:04:45.680> it<00:04:46.680> just<00:04:46.889> did<00:04:49.280> I'm<00:04:50.280> not

00:04:50.450 --> 00:04:50.460 
break I know it is it just did I'm not

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:52.840 
break I know it is it just did I'm not
sure<00:04:50.520> why<00:04:50.910> the<00:04:50.970> golden<00:04:51.449> shovel<00:04:51.600> is<00:04:51.840> quicker

00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:52.850 
sure why the golden shovel is quicker

00:04:52.850 --> 00:04:57.080 
sure why the golden shovel is quicker
but<00:04:53.850> this<00:04:54.479> is<00:04:54.660> and<00:04:55.400> I'm<00:04:56.400> pretty<00:04:56.580> sure<00:04:56.669> it<00:04:56.880> won't

00:04:57.080 --> 00:04:57.090 
but this is and I'm pretty sure it won't

00:04:57.090 --> 00:05:02.350 
but this is and I'm pretty sure it won't
be<00:04:57.180> here<00:04:57.690> and<00:04:57.930> next<00:04:58.290> one<00:04:58.530> but<00:04:58.740> i'll<00:04:59.010> check<00:04:59.810> nope

00:05:02.350 --> 00:05:02.360 
be here and next one but i'll check nope

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:05.990 
be here and next one but i'll check nope
okay<00:05:03.360> so<00:05:03.419> now<00:05:04.199> for<00:05:04.560> a<00:05:05.340> second<00:05:05.699> thing<00:05:05.850> you're

not<00:05:06.180> you're<00:05:06.419> going<00:05:06.570> to<00:05:06.630> cover<00:05:06.840> this<00:05:06.960> with

00:05:07.189 --> 00:05:07.199 
not you're going to cover this with

00:05:07.199 --> 00:05:12.560 
not you're going to cover this with
grass<00:05:07.590> or<00:05:08.490> dirt<00:05:11.120> hopefully<00:05:12.120> your<00:05:12.300> friend

00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:12.570 
grass or dirt hopefully your friend

00:05:12.570 --> 00:05:18.040 
grass or dirt hopefully your friend
might<00:05:12.750> not<00:05:12.900> know<00:05:13.169> this<00:05:13.199> hits<00:05:13.530> the<00:05:13.590> dirt<00:05:16.130> and

00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:18.050 
might not know this hits the dirt and

00:05:18.050 --> 00:05:20.900 
might not know this hits the dirt and
then<00:05:19.050> let's<00:05:19.650> put<00:05:19.889> the<00:05:19.949> stone<00:05:20.340> pressure<00:05:20.610> plates

00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:20.910 
then let's put the stone pressure plates

00:05:20.910 --> 00:05:23.570 
then let's put the stone pressure plates
down<00:05:21.180> or<00:05:21.810> the<00:05:22.560> wooden<00:05:22.830> pressure<00:05:23.010> plate<00:05:23.280> so

00:05:23.570 --> 00:05:23.580 
down or the wooden pressure plate so

00:05:23.580 --> 00:05:29.680 
down or the wooden pressure plate so
it'll<00:05:23.760> make<00:05:24.240> it<00:05:24.389> hard<00:05:24.600> for<00:05:24.660> them<00:05:25.050> to<00:05:25.260> see<00:05:28.100> and

00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:29.690 
it'll make it hard for them to see and

00:05:29.690 --> 00:05:34.340 
it'll make it hard for them to see and
then<00:05:30.690> when<00:05:30.930> we<00:05:30.960> walk<00:05:31.320> in<00:05:31.350> it'll<00:05:32.340> explode<00:05:33.350> so

00:05:34.340 --> 00:05:34.350 
then when we walk in it'll explode so

00:05:34.350 --> 00:05:39.320 
then when we walk in it'll explode so
there<00:05:34.680> you<00:05:34.710> have<00:05:34.860> it<00:05:35.070> um<00:05:36.650> and<00:05:38.000> yeah<00:05:39.000> if<00:05:39.150> your
