to fly your phantom from your iPad I'm
using<00:00:26.820> an<00:00:26.970> iPad<00:00:27.300> Mini<00:00:27.510> I<00:00:27.779> can<00:00:28.380> use<00:00:28.500> a<00:00:28.529> regular

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:28.740 
using an iPad Mini I can use a regular

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:29.509 
using an iPad Mini I can use a regular
iPad<00:00:29.189> as<00:00:29.310> well

and<00:00:30.090> when<00:00:30.179> I<00:00:30.240> say<00:00:30.390> fly<00:00:30.630> I<00:00:30.660> mean<00:00:30.990> not<00:00:31.109> only<00:00:31.140> can

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:31.529 
and when I say fly I mean not only can

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:33.590 
and when I say fly I mean not only can
you<00:00:31.740> fly<00:00:32.369> it<00:00:32.610> with<00:00:32.850> a<00:00:32.880> controller<00:00:33.360> that's

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:33.600 
you fly it with a controller that's

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360 
it's made for the larger air frames that

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:00.920 
it's made for the larger air frames that
DJI<00:00:57.660> provides<00:00:58.020> like<00:00:58.350> the<00:00:58.760> f450<00:00:59.760> the<00:00:59.969> f-550<00:01:00.510> and

the<00:01:01.500> s<00:01:05.540> 815<00:01:06.860> m<00:01:07.860> so<00:01:08.549> what<00:01:08.700> I<00:01:08.729> did<00:01:08.820> was<00:01:09.119> because<00:01:09.330> I

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
the s 815 m so what I did was because I

small<00:01:13.020> hole<00:01:13.049> and<00:01:13.760> made<00:01:14.760> a<00:01:14.790> small<00:01:14.970> bracket<00:01:15.450> that

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:15.509 
small hole and made a small bracket that

goes in the back of the landing gear and
that's<00:01:17.430> where<00:01:17.610> I'm<00:01:17.729> running<00:01:18.090> my<00:01:18.270> datalink<00:01:18.869> now

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:29.009 
these are the canvas plugs now when you

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:30.950 
these are the canvas plugs now when you
have<00:01:29.340> upgraded<00:01:29.520> your<00:01:29.820> phantom<00:01:30.270> to<00:01:30.420> run<00:01:30.659> a

have upgraded your phantom to run a
zenmuse<00:01:31.650> gimbal<00:01:32.630> what<00:01:33.630> you've<00:01:33.780> probably<00:01:33.960> done

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200 
zenmuse gimbal what you've probably done

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:37.160 
zenmuse gimbal what you've probably done
is<00:01:34.350> you've<00:01:34.500> added<00:01:34.619> a<00:01:34.799> Naza<00:01:35.009> PM<00:01:35.939> UV<00:01:36.270> to<00:01:36.479> where

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
is you've added a Naza PM UV to where

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:39.200 
is you've added a Naza PM UV to where
you've<00:01:37.320> added<00:01:37.439> the<00:01:37.590> upgrade<00:01:37.890> board<00:01:38.210> with

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210 
you've added the upgrade board with

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:41.240 
you've added the upgrade board with
those<00:01:39.360> you<00:01:39.509> only<00:01:39.600> get<00:01:39.780> one<00:01:39.960> can<00:01:40.200> bus<00:01:40.439> port<00:01:40.740> so

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 
those you only get one can bus port so

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:43.910 
those you only get one can bus port so
after<00:01:41.909> you<00:01:41.970> plugged<00:01:42.210> your<00:01:42.329> gimbal<00:01:42.630> in<00:01:42.920> you're

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920 
after you plugged your gimbal in you're

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:45.109 
after you plugged your gimbal in you're
done<00:01:44.130> you<00:01:44.280> don't<00:01:44.340> have<00:01:44.490> any<00:01:44.610> more<00:01:44.700> can<00:01:44.909> bus

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:45.119 
done you don't have any more can bus

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:46.280 
done you don't have any more can bus
ports<00:01:45.420> so<00:01:45.509> what<00:01:45.659> you<00:01:45.750> have<00:01:45.869> to<00:01:45.990> do<00:01:46.079> is<00:01:46.200> either

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290 
ports so what you have to do is either

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:48.440 
ports so what you have to do is either
get<00:01:46.470> the<00:01:46.979> DJI<00:01:47.310> can<00:01:47.640> bus<00:01:47.880> hub<00:01:48.060> which<00:01:48.240> is<00:01:48.360> about

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
get the DJI can bus hub which is about

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:51.980 
get the DJI can bus hub which is about
$55<00:01:49.320> or<00:01:49.590> you<00:01:50.340> can<00:01:50.490> get<00:01:50.579> an<00:01:50.700> OSD<00:01:51.030> because<00:01:51.869> the

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990 
$55 or you can get an OSD because the

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:56.120 
$55 or you can get an OSD because the
OSD<00:01:52.439> gives<00:01:52.710> you<00:01:52.829> two<00:01:54.500> can<00:01:55.500> bus<00:01:55.710> ports<00:01:55.979> as<00:01:56.100> well

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:56.130 
OSD gives you two can bus ports as well

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:57.230 
OSD gives you two can bus ports as well
and<00:01:56.430> that's<00:01:56.490> a<00:01:56.729> little<00:01:56.909> over<00:01:57.060> two<00:01:57.210> hundred

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:57.240 
and that's a little over two hundred

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:59.450 
and that's a little over two hundred
dollars<00:01:57.750> a<00:01:57.960> friend<00:01:58.560> of<00:01:58.649> mine<00:01:58.770> lent<00:01:59.009> me<00:01:59.159> the

00:01:59.450 --> 00:01:59.460 
dollars a friend of mine lent me the

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:01.760 
dollars a friend of mine lent me the
king<00:01:59.700> of<00:01:59.729> the<00:01:59.909> OSD<00:02:00.630> so<00:02:01.200> that's<00:02:01.380> what<00:02:01.500> I'm<00:02:01.590> using

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:01.770 
king of the OSD so that's what I'm using

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:03.980 
king of the OSD so that's what I'm using
right<00:02:01.890> now<00:02:02.210> I'll<00:02:03.210> probably<00:02:03.450> replace<00:02:03.869> this

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:03.990 
right now I'll probably replace this

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:06.679 
right now I'll probably replace this
with<00:02:04.170> a<00:02:04.200> can<00:02:04.439> bus<00:02:05.040> hub<00:02:05.430> when<00:02:06.180> I<00:02:06.210> can<00:02:06.360> get<00:02:06.479> one<00:02:06.600> of

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:06.689 
with a can bus hub when I can get one of

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:08.749 
with a can bus hub when I can get one of
those<00:02:06.780> in<00:02:07.020> so<00:02:07.860> that's<00:02:07.979> how<00:02:08.129> I<00:02:08.160> have<00:02:08.280> a<00:02:08.340> wired<00:02:08.550> in

00:02:08.749 --> 00:02:08.759 
those in so that's how I have a wired in

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:13.240 
those in so that's how I have a wired in
and<00:02:09.979> the<00:02:10.979> Naza<00:02:11.220> VM<00:02:11.550> up2<00:02:12.000> comes<00:02:12.239> out

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:13.250 
and the Naza VM up2 comes out

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:15.700 
and the Naza VM up2 comes out
and<00:02:13.580> splits<00:02:13.880> all<00:02:14.030> this<00:02:14.180> for<00:02:14.450> me<00:02:14.900> with<00:02:15.200> the<00:02:15.290> OSD

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:15.710 
and splits all this for me with the OSD

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:18.040 
and splits all this for me with the OSD
and<00:02:16.130> so<00:02:16.550> I<00:02:16.610> can<00:02:16.760> able<00:02:17.000> I<00:02:17.030> can<00:02:17.210> get<00:02:17.420> to<00:02:17.600> canvas

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:18.050 
and so I can able I can get to canvas

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:19.900 
and so I can able I can get to canvas
items<00:02:18.440> into<00:02:18.980> the<00:02:19.070> Naza<00:02:19.250> which<00:02:19.550> is<00:02:19.670> what<00:02:19.790> you

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:19.910 
items into the Naza which is what you

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:21.850 
items into the Naza which is what you
need<00:02:20.030> if<00:02:20.150> you're<00:02:20.270> gonna<00:02:20.360> do<00:02:20.600> run<00:02:21.110> a<00:02:21.170> gimbal<00:02:21.620> and

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:21.860 
need if you're gonna do run a gimbal and

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:23.710 
need if you're gonna do run a gimbal and
a<00:02:22.610> datalink<00:02:22.940> now<00:02:23.090> if<00:02:23.180> you<00:02:23.270> didn't<00:02:23.450> want<00:02:23.570> to<00:02:23.630> run

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:23.720 
a datalink now if you didn't want to run

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:25.420 
a datalink now if you didn't want to run
a<00:02:23.750> gimbal<00:02:24.080> or<00:02:24.740> if<00:02:24.860> you're<00:02:24.980> running<00:02:25.220> some<00:02:25.400> other

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:25.430 
a gimbal or if you're running some other

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:27.010 
a gimbal or if you're running some other
brand<00:02:25.820> of<00:02:25.940> gimbal<00:02:26.270> you<00:02:26.540> don't<00:02:26.690> need<00:02:26.870> the

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:27.020 
brand of gimbal you don't need the

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:28.900 
brand of gimbal you don't need the
canvas<00:02:27.470> so<00:02:28.220> you<00:02:28.250> could<00:02:28.550> just<00:02:28.580> go<00:02:28.790> straight

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:28.910 
canvas so you could just go straight

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:32.050 
canvas so you could just go straight
into<00:02:29.450> an<00:02:29.570> Naza<00:02:30.020> pmu<00:02:30.980> v2<00:02:31.310> without<00:02:31.610> having<00:02:31.880> to<00:02:31.940> do

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:32.060 
into an Naza pmu v2 without having to do

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:36.310 
into an Naza pmu v2 without having to do
a<00:02:32.090> run<00:02:32.510> a<00:02:32.540> can<00:02:32.930> bus<00:02:33.170> hub<00:02:33.410> or<00:02:33.740> a<00:02:33.770> OSD<00:02:35.080> it<00:02:36.080> adds<00:02:36.230> a

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:36.320 
a run a can bus hub or a OSD it adds a

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:37.720 
a run a can bus hub or a OSD it adds a
lot<00:02:36.410> of<00:02:36.470> weight<00:02:36.650> like<00:02:37.040> I<00:02:37.190> said<00:02:37.400> I<00:02:37.430> don't<00:02:37.610> really

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:37.730 
lot of weight like I said I don't really

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:40.660 
lot of weight like I said I don't really
think<00:02:37.940> it's<00:02:38.590> designed<00:02:39.590> for<00:02:39.710> the<00:02:39.860> Phantom<00:02:40.220> they

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:40.670 
think it's designed for the Phantom they

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:43.540 
think it's designed for the Phantom they
don't<00:02:40.820> claim<00:02:40.970> it<00:02:41.150> to<00:02:41.270> be<00:02:42.310> your<00:02:43.310> it's<00:02:43.430> gonna

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:43.550 
don't claim it to be your it's gonna

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:45.160 
don't claim it to be your it's gonna
really<00:02:43.760> shorten<00:02:44.360> your<00:02:44.420> battery<00:02:44.750> times<00:02:44.960> with

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:45.170 
really shorten your battery times with

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:48.310 
really shorten your battery times with
all<00:02:45.380> the<00:02:45.410> things<00:02:45.860> that<00:02:45.920> I<00:02:46.040> have<00:02:46.720> on<00:02:47.720> my<00:02:47.780> phantom

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:48.320 
all the things that I have on my phantom

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:50.500 
all the things that I have on my phantom
I'm<00:02:48.530> only<00:02:48.680> getting<00:02:48.980> four<00:02:49.730> and<00:02:49.880> a<00:02:49.910> half<00:02:50.030> to<00:02:50.270> five

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:50.510 
I'm only getting four and a half to five

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:52.870 
I'm only getting four and a half to five
minutes<00:02:50.870> of<00:02:50.960> flight<00:02:51.140> time<00:02:51.220> with<00:02:52.220> all<00:02:52.370> this<00:02:52.550> so

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:52.880 
minutes of flight time with all this so

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:56.830 
minutes of flight time with all this so
I<00:02:53.800> just<00:02:54.800> wanted<00:02:55.190> to<00:02:55.280> do<00:02:55.400> it<00:02:55.550> so<00:02:55.760> I<00:02:55.790> did<00:02:56.060> it

00:02:56.830 --> 00:02:56.840 
I just wanted to do it so I did it

00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:58.600 
I just wanted to do it so I did it
but<00:02:57.290> yeah<00:02:57.500> I'm<00:02:57.680> probably<00:02:58.040> gonna<00:02:58.220> be<00:02:58.340> moving

00:02:58.600 --> 00:02:58.610 
but yeah I'm probably gonna be moving

00:02:58.610 --> 00:02:59.950 
but yeah I'm probably gonna be moving
all<00:02:58.700> this<00:02:58.820> to<00:02:59.000> a<00:02:59.030> larger<00:02:59.330> airframe<00:02:59.660> at<00:02:59.810> some

00:02:59.950 --> 00:02:59.960 
all this to a larger airframe at some

00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:02.290 
all this to a larger airframe at some
point<00:03:00.200> or<00:03:00.350> the<00:03:01.310> phantom<00:03:01.760> vision<00:03:02.120> that's

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:02.300 
point or the phantom vision that's

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:04.470 
point or the phantom vision that's
coming<00:03:02.540> out<00:03:02.690> and<00:03:03.020> late<00:03:03.530> November<00:03:03.980> hopefully

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:04.480 
coming out and late November hopefully

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:07.120 
coming out and late November hopefully
they're<00:03:05.480> saying<00:03:05.900> 20<00:03:06.260> to<00:03:06.380> 25<00:03:06.770> minutes<00:03:06.920> of

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:07.130 
they're saying 20 to 25 minutes of

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:09.550 
they're saying 20 to 25 minutes of
flight<00:03:07.280> time<00:03:07.460> on<00:03:07.880> that<00:03:08.270> if<00:03:08.990> they<00:03:09.140> do<00:03:09.200> get<00:03:09.410> that

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:09.560 
flight time on that if they do get that

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:11.800 
flight time on that if they do get that
great<00:03:09.860> I<00:03:10.160> will<00:03:10.790> definitely<00:03:11.180> be<00:03:11.300> adding<00:03:11.660> this

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:11.810 
great I will definitely be adding this

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:16.030 
great I will definitely be adding this
module<00:03:12.770> to<00:03:12.920> it<00:03:14.020> so<00:03:15.020> that's<00:03:15.110> the<00:03:15.320> air<00:03:15.440> end<00:03:15.710> of

00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:32.030 
tight in here you don't have to have

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:33.430 
tight in here you don't have to have
wires<00:03:32.330> everything<00:03:32.840> running<00:03:33.050> around<00:03:33.200> it's

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:33.440 
wires everything running around it's

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:34.780 
wires everything running around it's
real<00:03:33.590> nice<00:03:33.709> and<00:03:33.980> if<00:03:34.040> it's<00:03:34.160> real<00:03:34.310> nicely<00:03:34.670> in<00:03:34.730> my

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:34.790 
real nice and if it's real nicely in my

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:38.860 
real nice and if it's real nicely in my
trade<00:03:35.090> craft<00:03:35.300> case<00:03:36.670> this<00:03:37.670> is<00:03:37.850> the<00:03:38.030> ground<00:03:38.450> in

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:38.870 
trade craft case this is the ground in

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:41.530 
trade craft case this is the ground in
so<00:03:39.080> there's<00:03:39.320> two<00:03:39.560> parts<00:03:39.920> to<00:03:40.010> the<00:03:40.190> system<00:03:40.610> the

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:41.540 
so there's two parts to the system the

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:42.790 
so there's two parts to the system the
air<00:03:41.720> in<00:03:41.959> which<00:03:42.170> I've<00:03:42.320> already<00:03:42.530> shown<00:03:42.769> you

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:42.800 
air in which I've already shown you

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:44.350 
air in which I've already shown you
which<00:03:43.070> is<00:03:43.220> I<00:03:43.370> have<00:03:43.730> hooked<00:03:43.850> to<00:03:44.000> the<00:03:44.120> bottom

00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:44.360 
which is I have hooked to the bottom

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:46.720 
which is I have hooked to the bottom
back<00:03:44.570> of<00:03:44.690> the<00:03:44.780> phantom<00:03:45.350> and<00:03:45.530> the<00:03:45.560> ground<00:03:46.400> in

back of the phantom and the ground in
the<00:03:46.910> ground<00:03:47.180> in<00:03:47.480> is<00:03:48.100> so<00:03:49.100> it's<00:03:49.310> nice<00:03:49.489> and<00:03:49.700> small

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:49.850 
the ground in is so it's nice and small

00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:54.840 
the ground in is so it's nice and small
-<00:03:50.260> it's<00:03:51.260> a<00:03:51.380> 2.4<00:03:51.920> gigahertz<00:03:52.600> transceiver<00:03:53.600> and

doesn't have to be you know anywhere
near<00:03:58.700> a<00:03:58.730> phantom<00:03:59.060> it<00:03:59.150> just<00:03:59.300> needs<00:03:59.420> to<00:03:59.540> be<00:03:59.660> close

00:03:59.920 --> 00:03:59.930 
near a phantom it just needs to be close

00:03:59.930 --> 00:04:02.650 
near a phantom it just needs to be close

it'll power the module so what happens
is<00:04:33.349> is<00:04:33.849> the<00:04:35.409> datalink<00:04:36.409> module<00:04:36.940> with<00:04:37.940> Bluetooth

00:04:38.379 --> 00:04:38.389 
is is the datalink module with Bluetooth

00:04:38.389 --> 00:04:41.379 
is is the datalink module with Bluetooth
connects<00:04:38.900> to<00:04:39.110> your<00:04:39.460> iPad<00:04:40.460> when<00:04:41.120> you<00:04:41.210> launch

00:04:41.379 --> 00:04:41.389 
connects to your iPad when you launch

00:04:41.389 --> 00:04:44.110 
connects to your iPad when you launch
the<00:04:41.539> iPad<00:04:41.870> app<00:04:42.110> the<00:04:43.009> iPad<00:04:43.490> talks<00:04:43.789> to<00:04:44.000> this

00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:44.120 
the iPad app the iPad talks to this

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:46.300 
the iPad app the iPad talks to this
datalink<00:04:44.419> module<00:04:44.720> with<00:04:44.810> Bluetooth<00:04:45.199> and<00:04:45.470> then

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:46.310 
datalink module with Bluetooth and then

00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:49.450 
datalink module with Bluetooth and then
the<00:04:46.550> datalink<00:04:46.909> module<00:04:47.770> talks<00:04:48.770> to<00:04:48.889> the<00:04:49.009> Phantom

00:04:49.450 --> 00:04:49.460 
the datalink module talks to the Phantom

00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:52.649 
the datalink module talks to the Phantom
over<00:04:49.940> 2.4<00:04:50.449> gigahertz<00:04:50.690> and<00:04:51.199> it's<00:04:51.470> a<00:04:51.560> long<00:04:51.740> range

00:04:52.649 --> 00:04:52.659 
over 2.4 gigahertz and it's a long range

00:04:52.659 --> 00:04:54.999 
over 2.4 gigahertz and it's a long range
so<00:04:53.659> it's<00:04:53.810> much<00:04:54.020> much<00:04:54.199> farther<00:04:54.500> range<00:04:54.830> than

00:04:54.999 --> 00:04:55.009 
so it's much much farther range than

00:04:55.009 --> 00:04:57.520 
so it's much much farther range than
Wi-Fi<00:04:55.400> or<00:04:55.699> Bluetooth<00:04:56.090> so<00:04:56.960> you<00:04:56.990> can<00:04:57.199> actually

00:04:57.520 --> 00:04:57.530 
Wi-Fi or Bluetooth so you can actually

00:04:57.530 --> 00:04:59.290 
Wi-Fi or Bluetooth so you can actually
upload<00:04:57.860> coordinates<00:04:58.400> in<00:04:58.550> the<00:04:58.669> air<00:04:58.819> you<00:04:59.150> can

00:04:59.290 --> 00:04:59.300 
upload coordinates in the air you can

00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:01.420 
upload coordinates in the air you can
change<00:04:59.960> the<00:05:00.169> Phantom's<00:05:00.500> flight<00:05:00.770> path<00:05:01.009> while

00:05:01.420 --> 00:05:01.430 
change the Phantom's flight path while

00:05:01.430 --> 00:05:03.790 
change the Phantom's flight path while
it's<00:05:01.580> flying<00:05:02.229> you<00:05:03.229> don't<00:05:03.379> just<00:05:03.530> have<00:05:03.650> to

00:05:03.790 --> 00:05:03.800 
it's flying you don't just have to

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:05.080 
it's flying you don't just have to
upload<00:05:04.039> coordinates<00:05:04.430> on<00:05:04.550> the<00:05:04.580> ground<00:05:04.849> and<00:05:05.000> it

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:05.090 
upload coordinates on the ground and it

00:05:05.090 --> 00:05:06.339 
upload coordinates on the ground and it
does<00:05:05.210> its<00:05:05.360> mission<00:05:05.629> it<00:05:05.690> comes<00:05:05.840> back<00:05:06.020> you<00:05:06.080> can

00:05:06.339 --> 00:05:06.349 
does its mission it comes back you can

00:05:06.349 --> 00:05:07.990 
does its mission it comes back you can
actually<00:05:06.469> change<00:05:06.860> these<00:05:07.069> things<00:05:07.129> while<00:05:07.849> it's

00:05:07.990 --> 00:05:08.000 
actually change these things while it's

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:13.270 
actually change these things while it's
flying<00:05:08.120> which<00:05:08.479> is<00:05:08.599> really<00:05:08.810> nice<00:05:08.930> to<00:05:09.289> do<00:05:12.280> so

00:05:13.270 --> 00:05:13.280 
flying which is really nice to do so

00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:16.689 
flying which is really nice to do so

00:05:50.379 --> 00:05:50.389 
back and automatically lands in your

00:05:50.389 --> 00:05:52.360 
back and automatically lands in your
front<00:05:50.599> yard<00:05:50.630> I<00:05:50.900> mean<00:05:51.080> it's<00:05:51.620> incredible<00:05:52.159> what
