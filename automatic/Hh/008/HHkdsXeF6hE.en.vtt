two<00:00:26.430> transformers<00:00:27.090> which<00:00:27.269> I<00:00:27.949> made<00:00:28.949> up

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:29.390 
two transformers which I made up

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:43.729 
two transformers which I made up
actually<00:00:39.379> so<00:00:41.840> I'm<00:00:42.840> just<00:00:43.020> going<00:00:43.260> to<00:00:43.379> leave<00:00:43.530> them

in the background so now for your Lego

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:59.459 
in the background so now for your Lego
transformers<00:00:55.850> so<00:00:56.850> they<00:00:57.030> could<00:00:57.210> move<00:00:57.329> forward

00:00:59.459 --> 00:00:59.469 
transformers so they could move forward

00:00:59.469 --> 00:01:05.999 
transformers so they could move forward
I<00:00:59.940> just<00:01:00.940> put<00:01:01.149> him<00:01:01.269> in<00:01:01.329> car<00:01:01.870> mode<00:01:04.710> sorry<00:01:05.710> about

and his t-rex pay attention to these
shield<00:02:23.680> I<00:02:23.890> know<00:02:23.950> the<00:02:24.280> Voyager<00:02:24.760> doesn't<00:02:25.120> have

00:02:25.229 --> 00:02:25.239 
shield I know the Voyager doesn't have

00:02:25.239 --> 00:02:27.809 
shield I know the Voyager doesn't have
 I<00:02:25.989> just<00:02:26.379> use<00:02:26.770> as<00:02:26.980> a<00:02:27.190> shield<00:02:27.220> it's<00:02:27.640> quite

00:02:27.809 --> 00:02:27.819 
 I just use as a shield it's quite

00:02:27.819 --> 00:02:35.970 
 I just use as a shield it's quite
cool<00:02:28.150> eschewed<00:02:31.980> okay

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:35.980 

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:38.790 

okay<00:02:36.610> so<00:02:36.670> when<00:02:37.330> you<00:02:37.420> start<00:02:37.660> with<00:02:37.870> is<00:02:38.319> the<00:02:38.470> C<00:02:38.650> by

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:38.800 
okay so when you start with is the C by

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:45.410 
okay so when you start with is the C by
twos<00:02:39.040> date<00:02:42.750> and<00:02:43.750> you<00:02:44.110> put<00:02:44.290> it<00:02:44.380> like<00:02:44.470> that

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:45.420 
twos date and you put it like that

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:48.210 
twos date and you put it like that
and<00:02:46.420> you<00:02:46.569> got<00:02:46.690> one<00:02:46.810> of<00:02:46.930> these<00:02:47.200> pieces<00:02:47.650> which

00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:48.220 
and you got one of these pieces which

00:02:48.220 --> 00:03:09.059 
and you got one of these pieces which
can<00:02:48.430> do<00:02:49.390> this<00:03:01.890> kind<00:03:02.890> of<00:03:03.010> dark<00:03:06.300> okay<00:03:07.739> so<00:03:08.739> we<00:03:08.890> were

00:03:09.059 --> 00:03:09.069 
can do this kind of dark okay so we were

00:03:09.069 --> 00:03:13.440 
can do this kind of dark okay so we were
at<00:03:09.220> the<00:03:09.370> point<00:03:09.640> where<00:03:09.880> I<00:03:10.769> think<00:03:11.769> you<00:03:12.130> know<00:03:12.450> what

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:13.450 
at the point where I think you know what

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:16.400 
at the point where I think you know what
this<00:03:13.660> is<00:03:13.930> you<00:03:14.260> know<00:03:14.410> I<00:03:14.769> can<00:03:15.310> flip<00:03:15.610> up<00:03:15.850> and<00:03:16.090> down

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:16.410 
this is you know I can flip up and down

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:26.300 
this is you know I can flip up and down
flip<00:03:17.410> it<00:03:17.590> down<00:03:19.200> and<00:03:20.200> put<00:03:20.440> it<00:03:21.840> to<00:03:22.840> like<00:03:23.910> that

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:26.310 
flip it down and put it to like that

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:31.949 
flip it down and put it to like that
then<00:03:27.310> take<00:03:28.260> one<00:03:29.260> of<00:03:29.290> these<00:03:29.560> pieces<00:03:30.569> and<00:03:31.569> put<00:03:31.840> it

00:03:31.949 --> 00:03:31.959 
then take one of these pieces and put it

00:03:31.959 --> 00:03:39.050 
then take one of these pieces and put it
there<00:03:32.489> then<00:03:33.489> you<00:03:33.700> take<00:03:33.910> one<00:03:34.090> of<00:03:35.549> these<00:03:36.549> pieces

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:39.060 

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:41.449 

clip<00:03:40.060> there<00:03:40.359> in<00:03:40.540> the<00:03:40.660> middle

00:03:41.449 --> 00:03:41.459 
clip there in the middle

00:03:41.459 --> 00:03:50.910 
clip there in the middle
do<00:03:42.459> you<00:03:42.579> take<00:03:43.980> two<00:03:44.980> of<00:03:45.010> these<00:03:45.400> pieces<00:03:49.739> which<00:03:50.739> I

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:50.920 
do you take two of these pieces which I

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:54.360 
do you take two of these pieces which I
use<00:03:51.160> one<00:03:51.670> of<00:03:51.880> them<00:03:52.239> each<00:03:53.079> of<00:03:53.380> my<00:03:53.500> Transformers

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:54.370 
use one of them each of my Transformers

00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:57.390 
use one of them each of my Transformers
as<00:03:54.579> what<00:03:54.850> I<00:03:55.150> mean<00:03:55.720> I'll<00:03:55.840> eat<00:03:56.019> one<00:03:56.320> and<00:03:56.560> each

00:03:57.390 --> 00:03:57.400 
as what I mean I'll eat one and each

00:03:57.400 --> 00:03:59.400 
as what I mean I'll eat one and each
electron<00:03:57.820> so<00:03:58.000> I'm<00:03:58.120> gonna<00:03:58.209> split<00:03:58.420> them<00:03:58.630> at<00:03:58.810> like

00:03:59.400 --> 00:03:59.410 
electron so I'm gonna split them at like

00:03:59.410 --> 00:04:02.759 
electron so I'm gonna split them at like
that<00:03:59.850> then<00:04:00.850> you<00:04:01.090> can<00:04:01.120> either<00:04:01.480> one<00:04:01.690> of<00:04:01.769> these

00:04:02.759 --> 00:04:02.769 
that then you can either one of these

00:04:02.769 --> 00:04:06.150 
that then you can either one of these
pieces<00:04:03.070> and<00:04:03.459> put<00:04:03.760> it<00:04:03.880> on<00:04:04.060> top<00:04:04.269> of<00:04:04.329> those<00:04:05.160> then

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:06.160 
pieces and put it on top of those then

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:10.970 
pieces and put it on top of those then
you<00:04:06.310> get<00:04:06.780> two<00:04:07.780> of<00:04:07.810> these<00:04:08.109> pieces<00:04:09.510> and<00:04:10.510> put<00:04:10.750> it

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:10.980 
you get two of these pieces and put it

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:17.759 
you get two of these pieces and put it
on<00:04:11.980> the<00:04:12.840> sides
