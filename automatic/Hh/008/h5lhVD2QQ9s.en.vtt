00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.990
 today I will show you how the 

00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:06.420
 trick if we so wish to call it for 

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:08.309
 folk meeting trick that will go hard 

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:09.660
 disconnect our opponent 

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:11.460
 so if we are ahead we are 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:12.990
 this trick the game will be given to us 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:15.389
 automatically won if we are in 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:17.250
 advantage the game will give us more will come 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:21.119
 date as unplayed so if 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:22.830
 we will win we will go to 12 points and three 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:25.199
 games to play while we lose 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:27.109
 we will remain so also we are then 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:29.640
 let's play the game 

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:31.199
 obviously I'm not like this 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:41.399
 holding credits for a world championship 

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:43.649
 had it ok if they can 

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:48.989
 be classified by the principals millions 

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:54.480
 and that like me at 20,000 credits 30 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:57.690
 maximum then for me to have in 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:01:01.109
 team for the 360 I do not feel a bit rich 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:09.030
 but I will have to return them 

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:13.110
 and tonight okay another bpl a little bugged 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:15.530
 But I don't really like this one 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:15.530
 team 

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:23.250
 now we will see the game is starting 

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:36.660
 yes no he is a replay fanatic 

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:44.320
 oh well and while we open I know little program 

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:47.650
 tactician I called a little program 

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:50.380
 tactical for video in the world 

00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:51.970
 that you don't see the real name you don't 

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:54.250
 I can resume that for these 

00:01:51.970 --> 00:02:01.470
 I use the big red name so not 

00:01:54.250 --> 00:02:01.470
 would make sense built by the beloved 

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:06.360
 yes , you want pop corn 

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:22.970
 a vast audience 

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:30.450
 what the fuck ok i 'm taking a break from when 

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:33.090
 video when I assigned him I marked 

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:34.940
 I bye bye been in advantage has 

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:39.720
 practically end of the first half 

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:42.870
 now I'll show you how they do it 

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:43.500
 disconnect then we have this 

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:47.310
 window 

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:52.739
 I would like to resume too ok we do 

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:57.120
 start and we carry so it should go 

00:02:52.739 --> 00:02:59.630
 well on the right the slide in the game e 

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:01.450
 will be the kalex 

00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:04.270
 Venetian 

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:07.180
 right now while laga and we have to 

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:09.819
 be ready to crush 

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:13.660
 stop then I took to the stop 

00:03:09.819 --> 00:03:20.890
 with tab and I support the finger on my e 

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:24.569
 let me drop for a moment that when 

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:27.780
 this ball that maybe makes me goals to cure 

00:03:24.569 --> 00:03:30.580
 of ready to crush stop 

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:32.140
 so now it takes a while from there 

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:34.330
 connection that the opponent because if 

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:36.819
 has a very good conversion left 

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:39.489
 equal to that of nasa I take a minute 

00:03:36.819 --> 00:03:41.650
 while if the correction is normal there 

00:03:39.489 --> 00:03:44.040
 puts little like now it came to you 

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:49.510
 outside the writing I crushed stop 

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:54.130
 as you can see I crushed the stop is the 

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:58.500
 connection loves to be interrupted 

00:03:54.130 --> 00:04:01.180
 next 1 0 

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:03.250
 advances 

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:06.850
 now the goals 12 points 3 games 

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:08.560
 left with the working turbo 

00:04:06.850 --> 00:04:10.090
 if you don't believe me I can show you 

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:13.450
 even with a defeat I do 

00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:14.769
 own goal I do abandon the trick 

00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:20.350
 available for playstation 3 

00:04:14.769 --> 00:04:22.120
