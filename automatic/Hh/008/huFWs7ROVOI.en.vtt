00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.650
 yes today and welcome here 

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:07.049
 back to a nightclub 

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:10.260
 I show my ideas today 

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:14.400
 I read you rbi I even think so 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:16.320
 almost that mentally , especially of all 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:17.420
 the textures because it is just so cool 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:21.090
 and looks real 

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:24.330
 yes that is yes I have a resolution 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:28.410
 128 times 128 pixels and we go 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:32.840
 first with us in the 0 3 as we do that 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:32.840
 always make such a moment 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:42.390
 it takes too long so here we are in 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:48.100
 and we see here everything is just 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:50.379
 really out of the sheep especially if 

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:55.710
 ye here is the water also provides 

00:00:50.379 --> 00:01:03.119
 just really out of here then we have 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:01:05.259
 wood and foliage 

00:01:03.119 --> 00:01:10.119
 this will bring me now fly completely 

00:01:05.259 --> 00:01:12.100
 short over the world here otherwise water 

00:01:10.119 --> 00:01:18.990
 By the way, water does not matter to me and here 

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:22.509
 in the cave okay here by the way that 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:24.250
 I think so yes but only so so 

00:01:22.509 --> 00:01:25.780
 So I give at least the map race 

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:27.009
 so you just look like it 

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:29.459
 then if you would play look 

00:01:27.009 --> 00:01:29.459
 would 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:38.830
 I think it's just really true 

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:41.069
 made it epic and I want it too 

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:45.940
 I use a recording power 

00:01:41.069 --> 00:01:49.810
 and yes, I find it extremely easy starts 

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:52.390
 just the worst geil because it just so real 

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:53.950
 the sun looks like i can i have 

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:56.410
 always forget to switch to night 

00:01:53.950 --> 00:02:00.300
 I'll do with you soon 

00:01:56.410 --> 00:02:00.300
 how it looks in the night 

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:10.200
 So where is the moon where is the moon? 

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:12.990
 Although the moon does not look so epic 

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:16.980
 but still there is a moon and 

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:18.440
 I'll fly that around here with the one 

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:21.180
 night over it 

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:32.600
 Here we have all eyes again 

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:32.600
 We'll be in the cinemas right away 

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:38.519
 or everything already finished each 

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:40.410
 Eat everything looks really right 

00:02:38.519 --> 00:02:45.239
 I just think it's cool and the ax 

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:49.519
 the brisk to cool from here comes the 

00:02:45.239 --> 00:02:52.080
 whole swarm to search all the ground 

00:02:49.519 --> 00:02:56.069
 we all went it like that 

00:02:52.080 --> 00:03:12.440
 nice the whole thinking could be better 

00:02:56.069 --> 00:03:15.019
 Let's make and grow in the 

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:21.000
 cabin 

00:03:15.019 --> 00:03:23.760
 Here we see the wood first times from 

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:27.630
 I say yes interest narrow planks around 

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:31.250
 That's the same with everyone 

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:34.290
 and here we see all the doctors 

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:40.590
 go over it because it just looks 

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:41.760
 horny diamonds here emeralds 

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:44.130
 By the way, look that way 

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:47.609
 there were there and looks really cool 

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:52.760
 I think so just batteries 

00:03:47.609 --> 00:03:52.760
 fly over to show it to you 

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:15.299
 why houses could look like 

00:04:08.609 --> 00:04:19.079
 dallas los anger attacks zombies 

00:04:15.299 --> 00:04:20.600
 a miscarriage a birth jost 

00:04:19.079 --> 00:04:23.639

00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:27.479
 fun aside, here's still lars 

00:04:23.639 --> 00:04:31.009

00:04:27.479 --> 00:04:35.539

00:04:58.530 --> 00:05:01.500
 Compared to the full text mpeg and the 

00:05:00.479 --> 00:05:03.659
 looks like this 

00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:06.360
 really brutal difference that lay 

00:05:03.659 --> 00:05:09.479
 but not somehow it seems to me 

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:12.570
 as if the sticks tournament performance sun 

00:05:09.479 --> 00:05:13.770
