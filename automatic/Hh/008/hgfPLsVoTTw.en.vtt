but this review will be taking a closer
look<00:00:59.539> at<00:00:59.870> how<00:01:00.079> it<00:01:00.199> was<00:01:00.289> translated<00:01:00.800> to<00:01:01.100> the

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:01.370 
look at how it was translated to the

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:03.939 
look at how it was translated to the
turbo<00:01:01.730> graphics<00:01:02.030> CD<00:01:02.629> and<00:01:02.870> resulted<00:01:03.649> in<00:01:03.770> what

00:01:03.939 --> 00:01:03.949 
turbo graphics CD and resulted in what

00:01:03.949 --> 00:01:05.980 
turbo graphics CD and resulted in what
might<00:01:04.129> possibly<00:01:04.430> be<00:01:05.030> one<00:01:05.420> of<00:01:05.539> the<00:01:05.720> worst

00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:05.990 
might possibly be one of the worst

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:16.350 
might possibly be one of the worst
versions<00:01:06.680> of<00:01:06.979> Street<00:01:07.250> Fighter<00:01:07.369> in<00:01:07.850> existence

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:16.360 

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:19.560 

oh<00:01:17.010> man<00:01:18.010> if<00:01:18.280> I<00:01:18.460> had<00:01:18.490> shelled<00:01:18.880> out<00:01:19.030> the<00:01:19.180> retail

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:19.570 
oh man if I had shelled out the retail

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:22.890 
oh man if I had shelled out the retail
price<00:01:19.840> of<00:01:20.070> $400<00:01:21.070> for<00:01:21.400> that<00:01:21.430> CD<00:01:21.940> drive<00:01:22.210> and<00:01:22.480> this

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:22.900 
price of $400 for that CD drive and this

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:24.960 
price of $400 for that CD drive and this
was<00:01:23.110> the<00:01:23.230> first<00:01:23.500> thing<00:01:23.680> I<00:01:23.830> played<00:01:24.070> on<00:01:24.250> it<00:01:24.430> I'd

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:24.970 
was the first thing I played on it I'd

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:27.290 
was the first thing I played on it I'd
probably<00:01:25.090> Hadouken<00:01:26.080> the<00:01:26.170> crap<00:01:26.500> out<00:01:26.710> of<00:01:26.740> my<00:01:26.950> TV

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:27.300 
probably Hadouken the crap out of my TV

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:30.510 
probably Hadouken the crap out of my TV
so<00:01:28.300> on<00:01:28.480> the<00:01:28.630> surface<00:01:28.840> it<00:01:29.350> looks<00:01:29.380> fairly<00:01:29.980> close

00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:30.520 
so on the surface it looks fairly close

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:32.760 
so on the surface it looks fairly close
to<00:01:30.730> the<00:01:30.850> arcade<00:01:31.210> original<00:01:31.360> other<00:01:32.110> than<00:01:32.560> the

title<00:01:33.250> change<00:01:33.550> I'm<00:01:33.790> still<00:01:34.510> not<00:01:34.630> sure<00:01:34.690> why<00:01:35.140> they

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:35.320 
title change I'm still not sure why they

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:36.860 
title change I'm still not sure why they
did<00:01:35.350> that<00:01:35.560> unless<00:01:36.160> it<00:01:36.340> was<00:01:36.430> their<00:01:36.640> way<00:01:36.790> of

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:36.870 
did that unless it was their way of
