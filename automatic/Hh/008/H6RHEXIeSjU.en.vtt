the<00:00:25.009> idea<00:00:25.669> for<00:00:25.849> the<00:00:25.939> commercial<00:00:26.450> was<00:00:26.599> simple

00:00:27.010 --> 00:00:27.020 
the idea for the commercial was simple

00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:30.190 
the idea for the commercial was simple
an<00:00:27.230> Audi<00:00:27.829> r8<00:00:28.180> assembled<00:00:29.180> by<00:00:29.300> six<00:00:29.630> technicians

as<00:00:31.550> with<00:00:32.450> most<00:00:32.599> simple<00:00:33.050> ideas<00:00:33.469> there<00:00:33.920> is

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:34.010 
as with most simple ideas there is

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:35.319 
as with most simple ideas there is
usually<00:00:34.340> more<00:00:34.460> to<00:00:34.610> it<00:00:34.700> than<00:00:34.820> meets<00:00:34.940> the<00:00:35.090> eye

00:00:35.319 --> 00:00:35.329 
usually more to it than meets the eye

00:00:35.329 --> 00:00:40.270 
usually more to it than meets the eye
and<00:00:35.719> this<00:00:36.020> idea<00:00:36.230> is<00:00:36.649> no<00:00:37.010> exception<00:00:39.190> using<00:00:40.190> a

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:40.280 
and this idea is no exception using a
