00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:03.410 
the red layer now we're going to select
the<00:00:59.489> red<00:00:59.670> layer<00:01:00.199> select<00:01:01.199> all<00:01:01.410> control<00:01:02.039> a<00:01:02.420> copy

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:16.240 
layer in now you don't want to black and
white<00:01:11.820> so<00:01:13.430> we'll<00:01:14.430> change<00:01:14.729> the<00:01:15.119> blend<00:01:15.450> mode<00:01:15.600> to

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:16.250 
white so we'll change the blend mode to

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:20.870 
white so we'll change the blend mode to
let's<00:01:17.250> go<00:01:17.400> with<00:01:17.549> screen<00:01:18.030> and<00:01:19.640> then<00:01:20.640> we'll

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
let's go with screen and then we'll

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:23.090 
let's go with screen and then we'll
adjust<00:01:21.240> the<00:01:21.420> opacity<00:01:21.509> a<00:01:22.080> bit<00:01:22.350> just<00:01:22.619> so<00:01:22.710> we<00:01:22.920> can

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
adjust the opacity a bit just so we can

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:26.450 
adjust the opacity a bit just so we can
take<00:01:23.430> out<00:01:23.640> some<00:01:23.939> of<00:01:24.060> that<00:01:25.250> some<00:01:26.250> of<00:01:26.369> the

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 
take out some of that some of the

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:30.620

texture<00:01:26.880> of<00:01:26.909> the<00:01:27.090> skin<00:01:27.150> and<00:01:29.270> we'll<00:01:30.270> bring<00:01:30.420> back

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
texture of the skin and we'll bring back

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:32.899 
texture of the skin and we'll bring back
some<00:01:30.840> of<00:01:30.930> the<00:01:30.990> color<00:01:31.170> later<00:01:31.520> let's<00:01:32.520> just<00:01:32.790> get

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:32.909 
some of the color later let's just get

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:34.460 
some of the color later let's just get
started<00:01:33.060> repairing<00:01:33.600> some<00:01:33.869> of<00:01:33.960> the<00:01:34.049> blemishes
