00:00:10.459 --> 00:00:16.610
 see how the floor level tap works 

00:00:14.539 --> 00:00:18.110
 which is set at all 

00:00:16.610 --> 00:00:21.000
 air suspension 

00:00:18.110 --> 00:00:25.590
 Ambulance 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:30.349
 come on down slowly the draw does not go 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:33.349
 Immediately and quietly depending on the angle 

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:33.349
 tilt 

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:41.710
 come on up slow down 

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:46.940
 drawdown not immediately 

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:50.230
 here swap it immediately there is no swap 

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:50.230
 pumping goes through time 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:54.560
 let's go higher 

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:02.500
 Here I went under the pap 

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:08.460
 middle position 

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:21.720
 Come a little bit down here has gone downhill 

00:01:18.730 --> 00:01:25.810
 let's abruptly down 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:31.000
 see it is not a quick descent 

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:34.470
 and quietly let little center 

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.470
 and a little bit down 

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:44.420
 working out does not come up yet 

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:57.270
 here went pumping 

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:12.789
 i.e. air flow is minimal 

00:02:20.819 --> 00:02:23.780
 down again 

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:36.590
 navalny went through time 

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:45.120
 so after all, except you can disassembly speed 

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:48.300
 regulates the same sawmill which is inside 

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:51.920
 build and twist or twist or 

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:57.900
 me from the general Kepler unscrew at all 

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:59.760
 walks fast format it all all now 

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:02.150
 let's see how the crane works 

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:05.670
 applied more correctly installed on 

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:09.660
 various semi-trailers for large vehicles 

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:11.130
 where the compressor is stationary where 

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:15.110
 air is not a problem 

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:17.640
 right such compresses a little nasty 

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:19.370
 small pic or rock to small 

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:23.209
 pressure gauge 

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:24.620
 or tsarevym about kamalyan rooted to the pillow 

00:03:23.209 --> 00:03:27.860
 to 

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:27.860
 here's a crane 

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:34.459
 about 7 atmospheres now pumped up 

00:03:35.269 --> 00:03:48.480
 went climb let's ok let 

00:03:43.639 --> 00:03:56.280
 let the time instant that is where 

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:59.550
 roar and descend let's rise moment 

00:03:56.280 --> 00:04:01.970
 again 

00:03:59.550 --> 00:04:01.970
 feedback 

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:08.850
 then 

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:10.890
 again please pay attention see 

00:04:08.850 --> 00:04:17.220
 lever stroke 

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:20.250
 come on, of course the air flow 

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:23.930
 very large of course you need a stationary 

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:23.930
 compresses with it very serious 

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:33.770
 usually 12 volt naturally such 

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:33.770
 loads of good luck everyone
