hi this is JB again with Austin homebrew
supply<00:00:02.490> and<00:00:03.890> this<00:00:04.890> segment<00:00:05.400> we're<00:00:05.640> going<00:00:05.670> to

00:00:06.260 --> 00:00:06.270 
supply and this segment we're going to

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:08.690 
supply and this segment we're going to
be<00:00:06.480> adding<00:00:06.750> more<00:00:07.049> hops<00:00:07.470> this<00:00:08.160> is<00:00:08.340> a<00:00:08.370> fairly

00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:08.700 
be adding more hops this is a fairly

be adding more hops this is a fairly
hoppy<00:00:09.120> little<00:00:09.660> beer<00:00:09.870> I<00:00:10.139> like<00:00:10.950> my<00:00:11.190> beers<00:00:11.490> fairly

hoppy little beer I like my beers fairly
hoppy<00:00:12.559> this<00:00:13.559> recipe<00:00:14.250> in<00:00:14.370> particular<00:00:14.940> is<00:00:15.179> meant

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:16.080 
hoppy this recipe in particular is meant

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:18.470 
hoppy this recipe in particular is meant
to<00:00:16.260> really<00:00:16.560> bring<00:00:16.890> out<00:00:17.039> the<00:00:17.250> nice<00:00:18.090> aromatic

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:18.480 
to really bring out the nice aromatic

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:21.320 
to really bring out the nice aromatic
quality<00:00:19.109> of<00:00:19.230> these<00:00:19.880> beautiful<00:00:20.880> hops<00:00:21.090> that<00:00:21.240> are

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:21.330 
quality of these beautiful hops that are

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:23.269 
quality of these beautiful hops that are
grown<00:00:21.510> up<00:00:21.660> in<00:00:21.779> the<00:00:21.869> Pacific<00:00:22.289> Northwest<00:00:22.320> so<00:00:23.070> I

00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:23.279 
grown up in the Pacific Northwest so I

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:24.769 
grown up in the Pacific Northwest so I
was<00:00:23.640> going<00:00:23.760> to<00:00:23.820> adjust<00:00:24.060> the<00:00:24.240> heat<00:00:24.420> may<00:00:24.630> be<00:00:24.689> a

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:24.779 
was going to adjust the heat may be a

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:26.450 
was going to adjust the heat may be a
little<00:00:25.019> hotter<00:00:25.260> but<00:00:25.619> it's<00:00:25.800> actually<00:00:26.189> fine

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:26.460 
little hotter but it's actually fine

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:28.310 
little hotter but it's actually fine
it's<00:00:26.730> rolling<00:00:27.180> away<00:00:27.269> which<00:00:27.599> is<00:00:27.630> what<00:00:27.930> you<00:00:28.080> want

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:28.320 
it's rolling away which is what you want

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:32.200 
it's rolling away which is what you want
so<00:00:28.710> now<00:00:29.609> I'm<00:00:29.760> going<00:00:29.939> to<00:00:30.000> add<00:00:30.179> some<00:00:30.689> more<00:00:31.470> hops

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:32.210 
so now I'm going to add some more hops

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:37.030 
so now I'm going to add some more hops
and<00:00:33.210> on<00:00:33.420> this<00:00:33.600> recipe

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:37.040 

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:39.350 

it<00:00:38.040> is<00:00:38.160> going<00:00:38.310> to<00:00:38.400> call<00:00:38.640> forth<00:00:38.970> I've<00:00:39.150> already

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.360 
it is going to call forth I've already

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:41.690 
it is going to call forth I've already
added<00:00:39.690> the<00:00:39.900> bittering<00:00:40.440> hops<00:00:40.550> initially<00:00:41.550> which

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:41.700 
added the bittering hops initially which

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:44.300 
added the bittering hops initially which
is<00:00:41.880> one<00:00:42.090> ounce<00:00:42.240> of<00:00:42.480> the<00:00:42.630> optimum<00:00:43.200> hops<00:00:43.440> now<00:00:44.250> I'm

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:44.310 
is one ounce of the optimum hops now I'm

00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:46.310 
is one ounce of the optimum hops now I'm
going<00:00:44.460> to<00:00:44.520> add<00:00:44.640> a<00:00:44.670> half<00:00:45.120> ounce<00:00:45.330> of<00:00:45.540> optimum<00:00:46.050> and

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
going to add a half ounce of optimum and

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:49.010 
going to add a half ounce of optimum and
a<00:00:46.410> half<00:00:46.590> ounce<00:00:46.860> of<00:00:47.040> Amarillo<00:00:47.730> hops<00:00:48.030> different

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.020 
a half ounce of Amarillo hops different

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:50.690 
a half ounce of Amarillo hops different
kinds<00:00:49.380> of<00:00:49.470> varieties<00:00:49.830> of<00:00:50.310> hops<00:00:50.490> from

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:50.700 
kinds of varieties of hops from

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:54.130 
kinds of varieties of hops from
different<00:00:51.090> areas<00:00:51.360> with<00:00:51.990> different<00:00:52.020> qualities

00:00:54.130 --> 00:00:54.140 
different areas with different qualities

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:56.840 
different areas with different qualities
all<00:00:55.140> of<00:00:55.350> our<00:00:55.500> hops<00:00:55.800> are<00:00:56.100> in<00:00:56.220> one<00:00:56.490> ounce

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
all of our hops are in one ounce

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:00.110 
all of our hops are in one ounce
container<00:00:57.630> so<00:00:58.200> I<00:00:58.490> wanted<00:00:59.490> to<00:00:59.550> be<00:00:59.730> super

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
container so I wanted to be super

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:02.060 
container so I wanted to be super
accurate<00:01:00.330> i<00:01:00.660> would<00:01:01.020> actually<00:01:01.200> measure<00:01:01.710> it<00:01:01.950> out

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
accurate i would actually measure it out

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:04.670 
accurate i would actually measure it out
but<00:01:02.850> i'm<00:01:02.940> not<00:01:03.120> that<00:01:03.420> particular<00:01:03.780> so<00:01:04.500> i'm<00:01:04.559> going

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
but i'm not that particular so i'm going

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:10.480 
but i'm not that particular so i'm going
to<00:01:04.740> eyeball<00:01:04.949> a<00:01:05.550> half<00:01:05.880> an<00:01:06.060> ounce

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:10.490 

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:15.880 

which<00:01:11.090> is<00:01:11.270> that<00:01:11.509> much<00:01:12.640> this<00:01:13.640> is<00:01:13.790> my<00:01:14.890> obviously

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:15.890 
which is that much this is my obviously

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:19.270 
which is that much this is my obviously
very<00:01:16.280> scientific<00:01:17.000> method<00:01:17.590> but<00:01:18.590> so<00:01:18.920> these<00:01:19.070> are

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:19.280 
very scientific method but so these are

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:23.230 
very scientific method but so these are
the<00:01:19.310> hops<00:01:19.580> and<00:01:20.000> there's<00:01:20.540> a<00:01:20.799> straight<00:01:21.799> end<00:01:22.240> it's

00:01:23.230 --> 00:01:23.240 
the hops and there's a straight end it's

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:25.359 
the hops and there's a straight end it's
about<00:01:23.299> a<00:01:23.570> half<00:01:23.930> ounce<00:01:24.229> give<00:01:24.530> just<00:01:24.799> a<00:01:24.920> little

00:01:25.359 --> 00:01:25.369 
about a half ounce give just a little

00:01:25.369 --> 00:01:29.170 
about a half ounce give just a little
bit<00:01:25.490> more<00:01:27.310> leaving<00:01:28.310> the<00:01:28.430> other<00:01:28.610> half<00:01:28.880> ounce

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:29.180 
bit more leaving the other half ounce

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:31.690 
bit more leaving the other half ounce
for<00:01:29.570> right<00:01:29.869> at<00:01:30.080> the<00:01:30.200> end<00:01:30.350> of<00:01:30.530> the<00:01:30.740> of<00:01:31.250> the<00:01:31.429> boil

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:31.700 
for right at the end of the of the boil

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:35.410 
for right at the end of the of the boil
that's<00:01:32.689> a<00:01:32.869> half<00:01:33.049> ounce<00:01:33.289> of<00:01:33.470> optimum<00:01:34.070> and<00:01:34.759> now<00:01:35.390> I

00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:35.420 
that's a half ounce of optimum and now I

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:39.160 
that's a half ounce of optimum and now I
need<00:01:35.780> a<00:01:35.810> half<00:01:36.110> ounce<00:01:36.350> of<00:01:36.530> Amarillo<00:01:37.220> humps<00:01:38.170> the

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:39.170 
need a half ounce of Amarillo humps the

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:45.690 
need a half ounce of Amarillo humps the
same<00:01:40.119> incredibly<00:01:41.119> scientific<00:01:41.869> method

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:45.700 

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:47.459 

generally<00:01:46.450> when<00:01:46.570> i'm<00:01:46.689> at<00:01:46.780> home<00:01:46.869> i'll<00:01:47.289> actually

00:01:47.459 --> 00:01:47.469 
generally when i'm at home i'll actually

00:01:47.469 --> 00:01:49.889 
generally when i'm at home i'll actually
measure<00:01:47.890> them<00:01:48.130> out<00:01:48.250> into<00:01:48.549> it<00:01:48.969> i'm<00:01:49.390> gonna<00:01:49.570> cup

00:01:49.889 --> 00:01:49.899 
measure them out into it i'm gonna cup

00:01:49.899 --> 00:01:51.630 
measure them out into it i'm gonna cup
and<00:01:50.170> i<00:01:50.200> can<00:01:50.380> kind<00:01:50.590> of<00:01:50.680> tell<00:01:50.950> the<00:01:51.189> difference

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:51.640 
and i can kind of tell the difference

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:54.060 
and i can kind of tell the difference
see<00:01:51.969> I<00:01:52.000> in<00:01:52.539> eyeball<00:01:53.079> a<00:01:53.110> half<00:01:53.439> ounce<00:01:53.590> or<00:01:53.740> if<00:01:53.979> you

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:54.070 
see I in eyeball a half ounce or if you

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:55.529 
see I in eyeball a half ounce or if you
want<00:01:54.250> you<00:01:54.310> can<00:01:54.429> wait<00:01:54.640> out<00:01:54.850> that's<00:01:55.149> probably

00:01:55.529 --> 00:01:55.539 
want you can wait out that's probably

00:01:55.539 --> 00:01:56.880 
want you can wait out that's probably
better<00:01:55.719> way<00:01:55.869> but<00:01:56.320> there's<00:01:56.469> about<00:01:56.649> a<00:01:56.710> half

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:56.890 
better way but there's about a half

00:01:56.890 --> 00:02:01.320 
better way but there's about a half
ounce<00:01:57.509> amarillo<00:01:58.509> hops

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:01.330 

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:04.270 

all<00:02:02.330> right<00:02:02.690> now<00:02:03.320> these<00:02:03.560> are<00:02:03.800> going<00:02:03.950> to<00:02:04.040> boil

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:04.280 
all right now these are going to boil

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:06.280 
all right now these are going to boil
for<00:02:04.610> about<00:02:04.730> another<00:02:04.910> 10<00:02:05.360> minutes<00:02:05.630> then<00:02:06.200> we're

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:06.290 
for about another 10 minutes then we're

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:07.900 
for about another 10 minutes then we're
going<00:02:06.380> to<00:02:06.440> add<00:02:06.530> the<00:02:06.830> last<00:02:07.010> part<00:02:07.310> of<00:02:07.640> the<00:02:07.730> hops

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:07.910 
going to add the last part of the hops

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:08.800 
going to add the last part of the hops
and<00:02:08.090> then<00:02:08.180> we're<00:02:08.270> going<00:02:08.360> to<00:02:08.450> chill<00:02:08.660> it<00:02:08.780> down

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:08.810 
and then we're going to chill it down
