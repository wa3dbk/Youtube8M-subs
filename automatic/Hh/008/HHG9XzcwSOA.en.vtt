thing<00:01:01.949> is<00:01:01.980> that<00:01:02.370> they<00:01:02.879> weren't<00:01:03.180> so<00:01:03.719> full<00:01:04.170> I

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589

shedding<00:01:55.320> it<00:01:55.649> does<00:01:55.860> shed<00:01:56.250> a<00:01:56.280> little<00:01:56.610> bit<00:01:56.969> and<00:01:57.149> I

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270 
shedding it does shed a little bit and I

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:59.719 
shedding it does shed a little bit and I
did<00:01:57.509> steal<00:01:57.869> my<00:01:58.140> webs<00:01:58.439> and<00:01:59.189> this<00:01:59.520> is<00:01:59.640> just

00:01:59.719 --> 00:01:59.729 
did steal my webs and this is just

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:02.270 
did steal my webs and this is just
initial<00:02:00.240> shedding<00:02:00.659> so<00:02:00.869> hopefully<00:02:01.469> after<00:02:01.500> a

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:02.280 
initial shedding so hopefully after a

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:05.600 
initial shedding so hopefully after a
couple<00:02:02.729> of<00:02:02.909> days<00:02:02.969> or<00:02:03.479> so<00:02:03.780> it<00:02:04.740> kind<00:02:05.159> of<00:02:05.310> calms

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:05.610 
couple of days or so it kind of calms

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:09.910 
couple of days or so it kind of calms
down<00:02:05.909> as<00:02:06.840> far<00:02:07.200> as<00:02:07.380> the<00:02:07.649> shedding<00:02:08.160> goes

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:09.920 
down as far as the shedding goes

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:12.840 
down as far as the shedding goes
tangling<00:02:10.920> it<00:02:11.039> does<00:02:11.220> not<00:02:11.370> tangle

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:12.850 
tangling it does not tangle

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:15.630 
tangling it does not tangle
