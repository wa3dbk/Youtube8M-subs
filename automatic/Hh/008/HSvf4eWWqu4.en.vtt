00:00:58.329 --> 00:00:58.339 
barrels which is the most important the

00:00:58.339 --> 00:01:00.549 
barrels which is the most important the
the<00:00:58.670> first<00:00:59.059> two<00:00:59.329> are<00:00:59.629> the<00:00:59.659> muzzle<00:01:00.199> brake<00:01:00.409> and

00:01:00.549 --> 00:01:00.559 
the first two are the muzzle brake and

00:01:00.559 --> 00:01:02.290 
the first two are the muzzle brake and
the<00:01:00.769> compensator<00:01:01.280> and<00:01:01.550> you<00:01:01.670> obviously<00:01:02.089> know

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:02.300 
the compensator and you obviously know

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:04.720 
the compensator and you obviously know
what<00:01:02.569> that<00:01:02.719> is<00:01:02.899> a<00:01:02.929> muzzle<00:01:03.559> brake<00:01:03.730> decreases

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:04.730 
what that is a muzzle brake decreases

00:01:04.730 --> 00:01:06.850 
what that is a muzzle brake decreases
the<00:01:05.150> vertical<00:01:05.780> recall<00:01:06.050> what<00:01:06.230> the<00:01:06.350> compensator

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:06.860 
the vertical recall what the compensator

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:09.219 
the vertical recall what the compensator
decreases<00:01:07.400> the<00:01:07.490> horizontal<00:01:08.000> recall<00:01:08.420> then<00:01:08.990> we

00:01:09.219 --> 00:01:09.229 
decreases the horizontal recall then we

00:01:09.229 --> 00:01:11.530 
decreases the horizontal recall then we
got<00:01:09.440> the<00:01:09.740> that<00:01:10.100> fucking<00:01:10.670> dark<00:01:11.030> Bell<00:01:11.270> thing

this thing actually does guys let me
explain<00:01:17.420> you<00:01:17.480> once<00:01:18.050> you're<00:01:18.200> shooting<00:01:18.470> a

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:20.870 
shotgun the pellets shoot out from the

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:24.160 
shotgun the pellets shoot out from the
barrel<00:01:21.230> in<00:01:21.470> a<00:01:21.800> circle<00:01:22.550> shape<00:01:22.780> what<00:01:23.780> that<00:01:23.930> means

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:24.170 
barrel in a circle shape what that means

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:26.530 
barrel in a circle shape what that means
is<00:01:24.440> that<00:01:24.470> if<00:01:25.010> you<00:01:25.190> hit<00:01:25.400> your<00:01:25.640> target<00:01:26.120> at<00:01:26.270> the

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:26.540 
is that if you hit your target at the

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:28.540 
is that if you hit your target at the
chest<00:01:26.900> most<00:01:27.470> of<00:01:27.710> the<00:01:27.800> parents<00:01:28.130> will<00:01:28.280> probably

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:28.550 
chest most of the parents will probably

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:30.640 
chest most of the parents will probably
go<00:01:29.120> and<00:01:29.450> hit<00:01:29.780> him<00:01:29.930> on<00:01:30.020> the<00:01:30.140> chest<00:01:30.350> you'll

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:30.650 
go and hit him on the chest you'll

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:32.200 
go and hit him on the chest you'll
probably<00:01:30.830> kill<00:01:31.190> them<00:01:31.310> easier<00:01:31.730> what<00:01:32.090> the

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:32.210 
probably kill them easier what the

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:34.690 
probably kill them easier what the
duckbill<00:01:32.570> actually<00:01:33.260> does<00:01:33.470> it<00:01:33.740> flattens<00:01:34.370> it

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:34.700 
duckbill actually does it flattens it

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:38.380 
duckbill actually does it flattens it
makes<00:01:35.240> the<00:01:35.870> pellets<00:01:36.680> to<00:01:36.920> shoot<00:01:37.430> horizontally

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:38.390 
makes the pellets to shoot horizontally

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:40.150 
makes the pellets to shoot horizontally
more<00:01:38.570> horizontal<00:01:39.230> what<00:01:39.410> our<00:01:39.560> thing<00:01:39.980> actually

00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:40.160 
more horizontal what our thing actually

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:42.940 
more horizontal what our thing actually
does<00:01:40.550> in<00:01:40.850> medium<00:01:41.360> to<00:01:41.570> long<00:01:41.780> range<00:01:42.050> or<00:01:42.290> even<00:01:42.680> in

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:42.950 
does in medium to long range or even in

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:45.730 
does in medium to long range or even in
close<00:01:43.220> range<00:01:43.580> it<00:01:44.030> forces<00:01:44.570> the<00:01:44.720> pellets<00:01:45.140> to

00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:45.740 
close range it forces the pellets to

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:48.100 
close range it forces the pellets to
escape<00:01:46.280> your<00:01:46.490> target<00:01:46.970> from<00:01:47.270> the<00:01:47.510> left<00:01:47.750> and<00:01:47.990> the

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:48.110 
escape your target from the left and the

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:50.620 
escape your target from the left and the
right<00:01:48.320> side<00:01:48.680> so<00:01:49.280> basically<00:01:49.490> the<00:01:49.940> doctrine<00:01:50.390> is

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:50.630 
right side so basically the doctrine is

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:53.290 
right side so basically the doctrine is
made<00:01:50.960> for<00:01:51.290> hunting<00:01:51.980> in<00:01:52.100> my<00:01:52.310> opinion<00:01:52.850> but

00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:53.300 
made for hunting in my opinion but

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:55.570 
made for hunting in my opinion but
that's<00:01:53.510> decided<00:01:54.080> to<00:01:54.230> put<00:01:54.440> it<00:01:54.560> there<00:01:54.830> mostly

00:01:55.570 --> 00:01:55.580 
that's decided to put it there mostly

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:58.810 
that's decided to put it there mostly
for<00:01:56.470> multikills<00:01:57.470> I<00:01:57.650> guess<00:01:57.890> like<00:01:58.190> if<00:01:58.400> you<00:01:58.550> flank

00:01:58.810 --> 00:01:58.820 
for multikills I guess like if you flank

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:01.120 
for multikills I guess like if you flank
around<00:01:59.210> in<00:01:59.600> a<00:01:59.750> map<00:01:59.930> and<00:02:00.470> there's<00:02:00.650> like<00:02:00.830> five

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:01.130 
around in a map and there's like five

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:02.770 
around in a map and there's like five
guys<00:02:01.430> in<00:02:01.460> front<00:02:01.820> of<00:02:01.940> you<00:02:02.030> that<00:02:02.210> document<00:02:02.690> will

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:02.780 
guys in front of you that document will

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:04.960 
guys in front of you that document will
probably<00:02:03.200> hit<00:02:03.320> all<00:02:03.590> of<00:02:03.770> them<00:02:03.950> so<00:02:04.370> while<00:02:04.790> you're

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:04.970 
probably hit all of them so while you're

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:06.940 
probably hit all of them so while you're
hitting<00:02:05.180> one<00:02:05.540> guy<00:02:05.780> you<00:02:06.050> will<00:02:06.200> get<00:02:06.380> hit<00:02:06.590> markers

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:06.950 
hitting one guy you will get hit markers

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:09.130 
hitting one guy you will get hit markers
from<00:02:07.070> other<00:02:07.460> two<00:02:07.760> guys<00:02:07.940> probably<00:02:08.360> in<00:02:08.840> my

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:09.140 
from other two guys probably in my

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:11.380 
from other two guys probably in my
opinion<00:02:09.560> the<00:02:09.709> duck<00:02:09.920> bill<00:02:10.129> is<00:02:10.340> out<00:02:10.729> fucking

useless I don't know if someone's using
the<00:02:14.269> night<00:02:14.450> haven't<00:02:14.840> seen<00:02:15.050> a<00:02:15.080> single<00:02:15.410> person

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:15.650 
the night haven't seen a single person

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:17.920 
the night haven't seen a single person
using<00:02:16.069> that<00:02:16.220> thing<00:02:16.430> you<00:02:16.910> need<00:02:17.120> to<00:02:17.510> shoot<00:02:17.750> at

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:17.930 
using that thing you need to shoot at

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:20.170 
using that thing you need to shoot at
least<00:02:18.230> two<00:02:18.680> more<00:02:18.950> shells<00:02:19.310> in<00:02:19.519> order<00:02:19.819> to<00:02:19.969> kill

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:20.180 
least two more shells in order to kill

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:22.869

somebody<00:02:20.450> with<00:02:20.870> a<00:02:20.900> semi-automatic<00:02:21.709> rifle<00:02:21.980> so

00:02:22.869 --> 00:02:22.879 
somebody with a semi-automatic rifle so

00:02:22.879 --> 00:02:23.770 
somebody with a semi-automatic rifle so
I'm<00:02:23.150> gonna

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:23.780 
I'm gonna

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:26.140 
I'm gonna
just<00:02:23.900> move<00:02:24.440> on<00:02:24.680> from<00:02:24.709> that<00:02:25.130> thing<00:02:25.430> I<00:02:25.670> think

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:26.150 
just move on from that thing I think

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:28.420 
just move on from that thing I think
it's<00:02:26.330> good<00:02:26.540> for<00:02:26.780> hunting<00:02:27.020> ducks<00:02:27.650> or<00:02:27.950> something

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:28.430 
it's good for hunting ducks or something

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:30.910 
it's good for hunting ducks or something
but<00:02:28.880> not<00:02:29.090> for<00:02:29.420> fucking<00:02:29.750> killing<00:02:30.290> people<00:02:30.709> and

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:30.920 
but not for fucking killing people and

but not for fucking killing people and
then<00:02:31.130> we're<00:02:31.340> moving<00:02:31.580> on<00:02:31.880> to<00:02:32.000> the<00:02:32.090> modified

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:32.630 
then we're moving on to the modified

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:34.240 
then we're moving on to the modified
choke<00:02:32.930> and<00:02:33.170> the<00:02:33.290> food<00:02:33.470> shop<00:02:33.740> which<00:02:33.950> are<00:02:34.130> the

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:34.250 
choke and the food shop which are the

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:36.220 
choke and the food shop which are the
most<00:02:34.430> important<00:02:34.880> thing<00:02:35.090> about<00:02:35.720> this<00:02:35.990> video

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:36.230 
most important thing about this video

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:39.070 
most important thing about this video
guys<00:02:36.530> listen<00:02:37.010> up<00:02:37.130> open<00:02:37.520> your<00:02:37.550> ears<00:02:37.880> ears<00:02:38.510> now

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:40.760 
the modified choke and the full choke

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:42.400 
the modified choke and the full choke
are<00:02:40.970> basically<00:02:41.390> the<00:02:41.510> same<00:02:41.720> thing<00:02:42.050> the

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:42.410 
are basically the same thing the

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:44.920 
are basically the same thing the
modified<00:02:42.920> the<00:02:43.130> full<00:02:43.340> choke<00:02:43.580> does<00:02:43.970> exactly<00:02:44.660> the

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:44.930 
modified the full choke does exactly the

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:46.930 
modified the full choke does exactly the
same<00:02:44.959> thing<00:02:45.200> what<00:02:45.590> the<00:02:45.709> modified<00:02:46.250> choke<00:02:46.580> does

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:46.940 
same thing what the modified choke does

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:50.290 
same thing what the modified choke does
but<00:02:47.600> in<00:02:47.900> a<00:02:48.230> higher<00:02:48.590> effect<00:02:49.340> the<00:02:49.819> modified

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:50.300 
but in a higher effect the modified

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:52.600 
but in a higher effect the modified
choke<00:02:50.690> guys<00:02:50.959> fuck's<00:02:51.739> up<00:02:51.980> the<00:02:52.040> hipfire

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:52.610 
choke guys fuck's up the hipfire

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:55.540 
choke guys fuck's up the hipfire
accuracy<00:02:53.020> increases<00:02:54.020> the<00:02:54.500> the<00:02:54.530> spread<00:02:55.250> of<00:02:55.430> the

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:55.550 
accuracy increases the the spread of the

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:58.360 
accuracy increases the the spread of the
increases<00:02:56.239> are<00:02:56.450> the<00:02:56.750> accuracy<00:02:57.320> tightens<00:02:57.980> the

00:02:58.360 --> 00:02:58.370 
increases are the accuracy tightens the

00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:00.130 
increases are the accuracy tightens the
spread<00:02:58.730> of<00:02:58.910> the<00:02:59.060> pellets<00:02:59.480> it<00:02:59.630> doesn't<00:02:59.959> matter

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:00.140 
spread of the pellets it doesn't matter

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:04.150 
spread of the pellets it doesn't matter
if<00:03:00.440> it<00:03:00.680> is<00:03:00.709> a<00:03:01.030> dart<00:03:02.030> or<00:03:02.180> a<00:03:02.239> or<00:03:03.170> a<00:03:03.290> normal<00:03:03.590> pellet

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:04.160 
if it is a dart or a or a normal pellet

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:06.670 
if it is a dart or a or a normal pellet
but<00:03:04.489> it<00:03:04.730> doesn't<00:03:05.120> apply<00:03:05.300> for<00:03:05.390> frogs<00:03:05.959> and<00:03:06.290> slugs

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:06.680 
but it doesn't apply for frogs and slugs

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:09.160 
but it doesn't apply for frogs and slugs
obviously<00:03:07.340> so<00:03:07.760> while<00:03:08.090> you<00:03:08.330> if<00:03:08.600> you<00:03:08.720> fuck<00:03:08.959> up

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:09.170 
obviously so while you if you fuck up

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:11.860 
obviously so while you if you fuck up
your<00:03:09.530> stability<00:03:09.800> and<00:03:10.370> your<00:03:10.670> key<00:03:11.090> for<00:03:11.300> accuracy

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:11.870 
your stability and your key for accuracy

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:14.770 
your stability and your key for accuracy
it's<00:03:12.200> way<00:03:12.709> easier<00:03:13.640> to<00:03:13.670> kill<00:03:14.060> somebody<00:03:14.330> well

00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:14.780 
it's way easier to kill somebody well

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:16.449 
it's way easier to kill somebody well
you're<00:03:14.989> aiming<00:03:15.440> down<00:03:15.620> the<00:03:15.739> sides<00:03:16.040> and<00:03:16.310> you're

00:03:16.449 --> 00:03:16.459 
you're aiming down the sides and you're

00:03:16.459 --> 00:03:18.100 
you're aiming down the sides and you're
actually<00:03:16.670> hitting<00:03:17.090> the<00:03:17.209> guy<00:03:17.420> so<00:03:17.780> what<00:03:17.989> that

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:18.110 
actually hitting the guy so what that

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:20.110 
actually hitting the guy so what that
what<00:03:18.560> does<00:03:18.769> the<00:03:18.950> modified<00:03:19.400> choke<00:03:19.670> and<00:03:19.880> a<00:03:19.940> full

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:20.120 
what does the modified choke and a full

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:22.750 
what does the modified choke and a full
choke<00:03:20.300> do<00:03:20.569> it<00:03:21.019> actually<00:03:21.550> rewards<00:03:22.550> you<00:03:22.730> for

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:22.760 
choke do it actually rewards you for

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:25.990 
choke do it actually rewards you for
hitting<00:03:23.480> accurately<00:03:24.410> a<00:03:24.560> target<00:03:25.130> and<00:03:25.340> actually

00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:26.000 
hitting accurately a target and actually

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.150 
hitting accurately a target and actually
killing<00:03:26.269> them<00:03:26.510> way<00:03:26.780> easier<00:03:27.200> than<00:03:27.230> just<00:03:27.799> hip

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:28.160 
killing them way easier than just hip

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:30.610 
killing them way easier than just hip
firing<00:03:28.459> and<00:03:28.880> hope<00:03:29.269> for<00:03:29.660> some<00:03:29.720> pellets<00:03:30.230> to<00:03:30.410> hit

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:30.620 
firing and hope for some pellets to hit

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:32.490 
firing and hope for some pellets to hit
the<00:03:30.739> guy<00:03:30.920> and<00:03:31.220> kill<00:03:31.400> him<00:03:31.579> both<00:03:32.000> of<00:03:32.269> these

00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:32.500 
the guy and kill him both of these

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:35.140 
the guy and kill him both of these
attachments<00:03:33.500> are<00:03:33.530> absolutely<00:03:34.519> amazing<00:03:34.850> with

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:35.150 
attachments are absolutely amazing with

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:37.539 
attachments are absolutely amazing with
the<00:03:35.299> dart<00:03:35.570> for<00:03:35.900> medium<00:03:36.290> to<00:03:36.500> close<00:03:36.860> range<00:03:37.220> I

00:03:37.539 --> 00:03:37.549 
the dart for medium to close range I

00:03:37.549 --> 00:03:39.400 
the dart for medium to close range I
personally<00:03:38.239> love<00:03:38.480> the<00:03:38.660> full<00:03:38.870> choke<00:03:39.110> but

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:39.410 
personally love the full choke but

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:40.750 
personally love the full choke but
there's<00:03:39.590> a<00:03:39.680> problem<00:03:39.950> with<00:03:40.280> that<00:03:40.370> if<00:03:40.579> you're

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:40.760 
there's a problem with that if you're

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:43.090 
there's a problem with that if you're
trying<00:03:41.180> to<00:03:41.480> hit<00:03:41.690> somebody<00:03:41.989> hipfire<00:03:42.769> with<00:03:43.010> the

trying to hit somebody hipfire with the

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:45.850 
trying to hit somebody hipfire with the
full<00:03:43.310> choke<00:03:43.519> it's<00:03:44.030> almost<00:03:44.480> impossible<00:03:44.840> so<00:03:45.650> if

00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:45.860 
full choke it's almost impossible so if

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:47.620 
full choke it's almost impossible so if
you<00:03:45.950> got<00:03:46.160> a<00:03:46.190> good<00:03:46.459> aim<00:03:46.730> you<00:03:46.940> can<00:03:47.120> use<00:03:47.390> a

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:47.630 
you got a good aim you can use a

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:49.780 
you got a good aim you can use a
semi-automatic<00:03:48.500> shotgun<00:03:48.680> with<00:03:49.220> a<00:03:49.250> full<00:03:49.519> choke

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:49.790 
semi-automatic shotgun with a full choke

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:52.120 
semi-automatic shotgun with a full choke
and<00:03:50.120> use<00:03:50.299> it<00:03:50.450> like<00:03:50.600> a<00:03:50.660> DMR<00:03:51.200> with<00:03:51.470> the<00:03:51.560> dart<00:03:51.829> or

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:52.130 
and use it like a DMR with the dart or

00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:54.220 
and use it like a DMR with the dart or
use<00:03:52.459> the<00:03:52.609> modified<00:03:53.030> choke<00:03:53.359> incite<00:03:53.780> try<00:03:54.170> to

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:54.230 
use the modified choke incite try to

00:03:54.230 --> 00:03:56.229 
use the modified choke incite try to
separate<00:03:54.709> your<00:03:54.859> kills<00:03:55.190> between<00:03:55.459> aiming<00:03:56.120> down

00:03:56.229 --> 00:03:56.239 
separate your kills between aiming down

00:03:56.239 --> 00:03:58.539 
separate your kills between aiming down
the<00:03:56.299> sights<00:03:56.660> and<00:03:56.900> really<00:03:57.530> close<00:03:57.980> quarters

00:03:58.539 --> 00:03:58.549 
the sights and really close quarters

00:03:58.549 --> 00:04:02.170 
the sights and really close quarters
sure<00:03:59.030> hipfire<00:03:59.510> kills<00:04:00.079> and<00:04:00.519> that's<00:04:01.519> basically

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:02.180 
sure hipfire kills and that's basically

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:04.180 
sure hipfire kills and that's basically
what<00:04:02.690> you<00:04:02.900> need<00:04:03.019> to<00:04:03.140> know<00:04:03.290> about<00:04:03.410> the<00:04:03.769> modified

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:04.190 
what you need to know about the modified

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:05.650 
what you need to know about the modified
choke<00:04:04.519> and<00:04:04.700> a<00:04:04.820> full<00:04:05.030> choke<00:04:05.299> it<00:04:05.450> will<00:04:05.570> reward

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:05.660 
choke and a full choke it will reward

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:07.449 
choke and a full choke it will reward
you<00:04:05.989> when<00:04:06.200> you're<00:04:06.440> hearing<00:04:06.890> your<00:04:07.040> target

00:04:07.449 --> 00:04:07.459 
you when you're hearing your target

00:04:07.459 --> 00:04:09.370 
you when you're hearing your target
accurately<00:04:07.609> while<00:04:08.269> I'm<00:04:08.450> down<00:04:08.750> the<00:04:08.930> side<00:04:09.170> and

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:09.380 
accurately while I'm down the side and

00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:11.319 
accurately while I'm down the side and
let's<00:04:09.709> move<00:04:09.890> on<00:04:10.070> to<00:04:10.130> the<00:04:10.340> back<00:04:10.519> shot<00:04:10.760> there<00:04:11.120> are

00:04:11.319 --> 00:04:11.329 
let's move on to the back shot there are

00:04:11.329 --> 00:04:13.599 
let's move on to the back shot there are
the<00:04:11.480> frog<00:04:11.750> and<00:04:11.989> the<00:04:12.200> slack<00:04:12.500> the<00:04:13.070> back<00:04:13.250> shot<00:04:13.430> is

00:04:13.599 --> 00:04:13.609 
the frog and the slack the back shot is

00:04:13.609 --> 00:04:15.550 
the frog and the slack the back shot is
really<00:04:13.880> good<00:04:14.180> for<00:04:14.420> close<00:04:14.630> range<00:04:14.989> while<00:04:15.350> the

00:04:15.550 --> 00:04:15.560 
really good for close range while the

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:17.440 
really good for close range while the
dart<00:04:15.799> needs<00:04:16.010> a<00:04:16.130> couple<00:04:16.340> of<00:04:16.489> more<00:04:16.700> shots<00:04:16.729> but<00:04:17.359> it

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:17.450 
dart needs a couple of more shots but it

00:04:17.450 --> 00:04:19.479 
dart needs a couple of more shots but it
sustains<00:04:17.810> damage<00:04:18.289> in<00:04:18.470> your<00:04:18.680> medium<00:04:19.039> range<00:04:19.280> so

00:04:19.479 --> 00:04:19.489 
sustains damage in your medium range so

00:04:19.489 --> 00:04:22.360 
sustains damage in your medium range so
I<00:04:19.519> would<00:04:19.850> suggest<00:04:20.030> the<00:04:20.419> dart<00:04:20.690> in<00:04:21.070> medium<00:04:22.070> to

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:22.370 
I would suggest the dart in medium to

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:24.969 
I would suggest the dart in medium to
close-quarters<00:04:23.180> situations<00:04:23.470> with<00:04:24.470> the<00:04:24.710> same

00:04:24.969 --> 00:04:24.979 
close-quarters situations with the same

00:04:24.979 --> 00:04:26.830 
close-quarters situations with the same
aromatic<00:04:25.430> shotgun<00:04:25.850> the<00:04:26.120> frog<00:04:26.390> I<00:04:26.570> don't

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:26.840 
aromatic shotgun the frog I don't

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:29.020 
aromatic shotgun the frog I don't
recommend<00:04:27.140> you<00:04:27.800> could<00:04:28.010> try<00:04:28.310> it<00:04:28.370> out<00:04:28.610> in<00:04:28.850> there

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:29.030 
recommend you could try it out in there

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:31.270 
recommend you could try it out in there
really<00:04:29.240> classified<00:04:29.960> maps<00:04:30.229> and<00:04:30.500> the<00:04:30.680> slugs<00:04:31.010> are

00:04:33.790 --> 00:04:33.800 
obviously the most accurate animals you

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:36.100 
obviously the most accurate animals you

00:05:17.589 --> 00:05:17.599 
so if you're having a problem with your

00:05:17.599 --> 00:05:19.629 
so if you're having a problem with your
first<00:05:17.930> bullet<00:05:18.319> recall<00:05:18.830> your<00:05:19.009> first<00:05:19.340> shell

00:05:19.629 --> 00:05:19.639 
first bullet recall your first shell

00:05:19.639 --> 00:05:22.360 
first bullet recall your first shell
recall<00:05:20.120> actually<00:05:20.330> using<00:05:21.199> an<00:05:21.289> angled<00:05:21.680> grip<00:05:21.800> now

00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:22.370 
recall actually using an angled grip now

00:05:22.370 --> 00:05:24.159 
recall actually using an angled grip now
from<00:05:22.610> what<00:05:22.819> I<00:05:22.849> know<00:05:23.090> so<00:05:23.120> far<00:05:23.360> the<00:05:23.750> side<00:05:23.990> that

00:05:24.159 --> 00:05:24.169 
from what I know so far the side that

00:05:24.169 --> 00:05:26.200 
from what I know so far the side that
twelve<00:05:24.560> is<00:05:24.830> the<00:05:25.039> best<00:05:25.250> same<00:05:25.430> aromatic<00:05:25.940> salt

00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:26.210 
twelve is the best same aromatic salt

00:05:26.210 --> 00:05:28.959 
twelve is the best same aromatic salt
and<00:05:26.389> so<00:05:26.539> far<00:05:26.840> it's<00:05:27.259> just<00:05:27.349> with<00:05:27.620> 200<00:05:28.310> rpm<00:05:28.430> and<00:05:28.849> it
