00:00:10.010 --> 00:00:14.639
 to the question the publishing tools 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:17.550
 web classics are they outdated 

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:19.170
 I have an answer without appeal yes he 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:21.210
 just step back and get 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:23.789
 look at work when you want 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:25.560
 orchestrated his digital communication on 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:27.300
 is quickly found with 15 windows 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:29.460
 open different software for 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:31.949
 the website the social media webapp 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:33.570
 in short, we spend our day doing 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:35.460
 copy paste between all 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:37.020
 interfaces we note a real 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:38.760
 fragmentation of production tools 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:41.430
 who have not followed the evolution of the web 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:43.379
 which has become multi-screen and social 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:45.329
 consumers spend their 

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:47.309
 smartphone to their pc or tablet 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:48.180
 all day long and wait 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:50.910
 on each support 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:52.140
 a specific experience so how 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:52.770
 to find oneself from a point of view 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:55.500
 operational 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:57.539
 so far the management solutions 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:59.039
 of websites the cms were 

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:00.300
 usually simple tools of 

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:02.520
 publication of web pages 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:04.260
 a new trend is to go to 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:05.519
 real management solutions 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:08.040
 internet content 

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:09.409
 what difference will you tell me and well 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:12.630
 it's a fundamental difference 

00:01:09.409 --> 00:01:14.479
 induced precisely by this trend of 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:16.890
 multi screens and social media 

00:01:14.479 --> 00:01:19.140
 historically we publish content on 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:22.350
 a page for a visualization in a 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:24.060
 browser on a pc today it takes 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:25.590
 find a technological way for them 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:27.450
 to travel on different screens 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:29.610
 and on social media 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:31.590
 that's why modern software 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:33.960
 manages in the first sense of the term 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:36.090
 the content they go on the one hand the 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:38.549
 store properly for then 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:41.280
 adapt it automatically to different 

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:43.079
 destination media for example if 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:43.619
 a webmaster wants to share a page on 

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:46.140
 Facebook 

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:48.149
 when it is released the software will 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:50.040
 propose a text of eighth note and a 

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:52.079
 line is suitable some software 

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:53.939
 even allow to manage in one 

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:56.939
 tool all of his communication 

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:59.040
 digital of a standard content we pass 

00:01:56.939 --> 00:02:01.290
 to media ranging from email to the network 

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:02.130
 social going through the apps 

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:03.780
 audio 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:05.969
 one last point these new tools 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:07.950
 natively integrates social networks 

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:10.619
 and the principles of collaborative work 

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:12.569
 finally another feature is 

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:15.300
 enabled by these new tools the 

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:17.160
 community management system this is 

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:18.630
 to integrate the networks 

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:20.970
 social and working principles 

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:22.890
 collaborative this allows to switch 

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:25.440
 tools in tools to manage the activity 

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:26.970
 social media or the workflow on 

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:28.170
 a page for teams it's a 

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:30.030
 true revolution 

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:31.470
 from a more general point of view these 

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:33.300
 new tools are going more and more 

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:35.580
 to be like real little ones 

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:37.769
 operating systems that will allow 

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:40.470
 to make the content universal 

00:02:37.769 --> 00:02:44.239
 take the time to think about it and opt 

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:44.239
 for a new generation cms
