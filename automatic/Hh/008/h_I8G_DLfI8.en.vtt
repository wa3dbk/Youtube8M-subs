00:00:01.900 --> 00:00:05.950
 hi craft I'm going to show you how 

00:00:03.879 --> 00:00:09.009
 make these flowers so beautiful these 

00:00:05.950 --> 00:00:10.749
 can be used to decorate your layout 

00:00:09.009 --> 00:00:13.119
 or any other papercraft project 

00:00:10.749 --> 00:00:15.669
 They can even put some 

00:00:13.119 --> 00:00:17.410
 invitation or something like that really because the 

00:00:15.669 --> 00:00:20.859
 uses that they can give to these flowers 

00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:22.869
 they depend on your creativity and color 

00:00:20.859 --> 00:00:24.550
 who want to do it &amp; space and today you 

00:00:22.869 --> 00:00:25.839
 I'm going to teach you how to make two flowers 

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:28.779
 what are they going to do with the paper 

00:00:25.839 --> 00:00:30.939
 delgadito and others with the paper that is 

00:00:28.779 --> 00:00:33.790
 a little more hardness that is a cardboard 

00:00:30.939 --> 00:00:35.860
 allegany crafts but first let's see 

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:37.390
 how to do this that really 

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:39.760
 procedures are very similar 

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:42.310
 I'm going to require three drilling rigs 

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:44.380
 scouts or you can even do them with 

00:00:42.310 --> 00:00:46.540
 drillers with flower punches 

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:48.670
 but having three sizes 

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:53.110
 obviously different I am using 

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:55.660
 one of 2 inches and one and a quarter one 

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:57.910
 time two inches and it's smaller than 

00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:59.740
 is one inch and a quarter told you 

00:00:57.910 --> 00:01:02.740
 that is the paper that is thicker than 

00:00:59.740 --> 00:01:04.930
 let's use below but good 

00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:07.180
 first let's use that thin paper 

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:09.670
 from there I tell you I 'm going to have three 

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:12.400
 different measures and of these three 

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:14.560
 measurements I'm going to cut three of each one is 

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:16.150
 say three circles know two that are 

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:18.010
 what I'm doing here other flowers 

00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:20.200
 or whatever you want but that are 

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:22.780
 different layers now for this flower 

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:25.720
 very artistic that I did then what 

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:27.430
 they were watercolors and I'm 

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:29.200
 watercolors occupy them because the cne 

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:31.270
 although I was doing it because I had to 

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:35.890
 these colors like the cake well is that 

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:39.070
 I 'm going to use the lilac color as acqua or 

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:41.979
 that is there as a mint and 

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:44.200
 Pink flowers also how are you we are going 

00:01:41.979 --> 00:01:45.940
 to wrinkle melo because it really does not have 

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:47.590
 that to be very beautiful 

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:50.080
 simply that they look like spots of 

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:52.420
 color and then you see a finished capture 

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:54.310
 much more artistic of this lilac color 

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:56.440
 I'm going to paint a big circle one 

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:58.570
 medium and a small one later with the 

00:01:56.440 --> 00:02:01.330
 another water color like I'm going to paint one 

00:01:58.570 --> 00:02:04.119
 big one medium and one small and what 

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:05.710
 same I will do with the color pink but 

00:02:04.119 --> 00:02:07.570
 with the color pink I will not use my 

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:09.190
 watercolors although I could have done it 

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:12.580
 and the truth would have been very nice 

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:15.550
 also but with the color pink I'm going to 

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:17.440
 use a spray tub that these inks 

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:20.110
 when I'm really enjoying these 

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:23.500
 spray inks because they serve for the 

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:25.930
 layout in a perfect way the truth 

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:29.470
 I like them a lot and they give a lot 

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:31.240
 color with very little with very little effort 

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:33.550
 and with very little ink there is the store 

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:35.310
 of spray like I gave the shot to 

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:38.080
 where it was not but good after 

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:40.000
 reading the shot where I followed 

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:42.370
 liked because it was not like the color 

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:44.530
 super intense if not splashed 

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:46.390
 and well that is precisely the charm 

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:48.430
 of these flowers you can do it 

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:50.650
 I say without color just like that even 

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:53.110
 can be made with newspaper sheets and 

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:55.209
 they are super nice now I am going to take 

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:57.640
 each of those circles that I already cut 

00:02:55.209 --> 00:02:59.350
 with my punch and I'm going to wrinkle them 

00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:02.800
 Since they are already wet, well, they are going to 

00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:04.420
 be much easier I'm going to take the and 

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:07.000
 I'm going to wrinkle them as if I hated them 

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:11.080
 and after that they are dry because the 

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:13.330
 I'm going to unfold or develop 

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:15.940
 but I'm not going to iron those 

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:18.670
 I'm going to want it wrinkled and well 

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:21.190
 I'm going to do it layer by layer after 

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:21.760
 this I will take my punch and with the 

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:24.340
 awl 

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:26.410
 I'm going to drill the center of each of 

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:28.900
 these circles so that now you can 

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:31.690
 start to form my blog I'm going to put 

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:34.240
 each one there and after this I'm going to 

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:38.560
 use those we call bratz or brooches 

00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:40.690
 of little feet and I'm going to put them all 

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:41.680
 the layers together I'm going to stick in the 

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:43.990
 center 

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:45.640
 one of those milestone brooches and in the part 

00:03:43.990 --> 00:03:47.260
 from behind that are the legs 

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:49.180
 Well, I'm going to open them if you do not have 

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:50.890
 these place if you do not worry you can 

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:52.990
 do maybe with hot silicone or 

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:56.200
 cold silicone even a little bit more 

00:03:52.990 --> 00:03:58.480
 taken with these glues well 

00:03:56.200 --> 00:04:01.360
 you can go putting layers on layer and 

00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:04.000
 layer on layer so that perfectly 

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:06.240
 so you can arm these bars and good 

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:08.070
 we are already this is the flower 

00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:10.530
 one that I'm going to teach you and now I'm going 

00:04:08.070 --> 00:04:13.740
 to teach how to do one of these a lot 

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:16.290
 thicker and this is going to be a flower 

00:04:13.740 --> 00:04:18.270
 like in very vintage style the other one was 

00:04:16.290 --> 00:04:20.190
 very artistic and very alive and everything but 

00:04:18.270 --> 00:04:23.310
 now I'm going to do I'm going to teach how to do 

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:25.230
 this is a very vintage style very like 

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:27.450
 I was old and it can be for 

00:04:25.230 --> 00:04:30.240
 projects or photo albums so that 

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:31.560
 is just like old people so it's that 

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:33.360
 Well, the first thing we are going to do is 

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:35.610
 that we are going to break the fibers of the paper 

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:38.670
 for this I relied on a base of 

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:40.440
 foami that this is for sewing but in 

00:04:38.670 --> 00:04:43.770
 this base foami with my scissors 

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:46.320
 I started like to press and carve and 

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:47.940
 this is going to serve to break me as you 

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:50.580
 said the fibers of the paper and that the 

00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:53.190
 paper is not so rigid after this 

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:56.220
 or before it may be I'll even try 

00:04:53.190 --> 00:04:57.810
 all my edges of brown color is 

00:04:56.220 --> 00:05:01.290
 so that the flowers look like 

00:04:57.810 --> 00:05:03.630
 old ladies and once I've done this I'm going 

00:05:01.290 --> 00:05:07.260
 to wet my flowers this I did with 

00:05:03.630 --> 00:05:10.560
 a sprayer that I have and I 'll wait for 

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:12.180
 that consumes a little bit of water so that 

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:14.490
 they become very 

00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:16.259
 the flowers and they can wrinkle in a 

00:05:14.490 --> 00:05:18.810
 perfect way even paper is not 

00:05:16.259 --> 00:05:22.050
 break or anything like that here we go 

00:05:18.810 --> 00:05:24.090
 to unroll or we are going to undo that 

00:05:22.050 --> 00:05:27.750
 little ball of paper that we had made and 

00:05:24.090 --> 00:05:30.330
 we are going to drill each one of the 

00:05:27.750 --> 00:05:32.729
 capita we had already had and the 

00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:35.100
 let's put in the punch for 

00:05:32.729 --> 00:05:37.320
 continue doing the same process 

00:05:35.100 --> 00:05:39.150
 let's put an arm or a brooch quoted 

00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:42.509
 of little feet and this is going to serve me 

00:05:39.150 --> 00:05:44.520
 very much for these layers or these 

00:05:42.509 --> 00:05:47.190
 petals so they can stay together 

00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:49.949
 then I said there we are putting the 

00:05:47.190 --> 00:05:52.169
 pin clasp and really it remains 

00:05:49.949 --> 00:05:54.360
 well the super pretty flower something very 

00:05:52.169 --> 00:05:56.400
 important is that when they are made 

00:05:54.360 --> 00:05:59.310
 you can let the balls dry even 

00:05:56.400 --> 00:06:02.160
 you can pass your gun to invade 

00:05:59.310 --> 00:06:06.150
 so they can dry perfectly 

00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:07.680
 the capes before passing the punch through 

00:06:06.150 --> 00:06:09.180
 in the middle of them and well then 

00:06:07.680 --> 00:06:12.000
 they were more and the flowers you can 

00:06:09.180 --> 00:06:14.160
 make the size you want 

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:16.560
 in the textures that you want from the paper 

00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:17.910
 I already showed you how to do it in two ways 

00:06:16.560 --> 00:06:20.850
 different I hope you liked it 

00:06:17.910 --> 00:06:22.740
 very much I send you a super greatness not 

00:06:20.850 --> 00:06:24.540
 forget to share this tutorial and 

00:06:22.740 --> 00:06:26.940
 to give us little hands up if you're 

00:06:24.540 --> 00:06:29.060
 liked to see you in the next video bye 

00:06:26.940 --> 00:06:29.060
 bye
