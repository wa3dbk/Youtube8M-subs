00:00:04.039 --> 00:00:04.049 
we're going to talk about a program

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:06.289 
we're going to talk about a program
called<00:00:04.440> dragon<00:00:04.980> dictation<00:00:05.370> which<00:00:06.060> is<00:00:06.270> a

00:00:06.289 --> 00:00:06.299 
called dragon dictation which is a

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:09.470 
called dragon dictation which is a
really<00:00:06.720> cool<00:00:07.020> concept<00:00:07.290> and<00:00:07.890> how<00:00:07.970> it<00:00:08.970> works<00:00:09.240> is

00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:09.480 
really cool concept and how it works is

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:15.680 
really cool concept and how it works is
you<00:00:10.759> simply<00:00:11.759> talk<00:00:12.450> and<00:00:13.009> as<00:00:14.009> you<00:00:14.389> speak<00:00:15.389> it's

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:15.690 
you simply talk and as you speak it's

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:19.070 
you simply talk and as you speak it's
going<00:00:16.049> to<00:00:16.260> upload<00:00:17.010> that<00:00:17.310> information<00:00:17.840> to<00:00:18.840> the

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:19.080 
going to upload that information to the

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:20.929 
going to upload that information to the
server<00:00:19.350> to<00:00:19.680> analyze<00:00:20.100> your<00:00:20.310> voice<00:00:20.580> and<00:00:20.880> then

00:00:20.929 --> 00:00:20.939 
server to analyze your voice and then

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:27.800 
server to analyze your voice and then
download<00:00:21.869> again<00:00:21.990> of<00:00:24.050> the<00:00:25.050> text<00:00:25.800> of<00:00:26.150> what<00:00:27.150> it

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:27.810 
download again of the text of what it

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:29.720 
download again of the text of what it
interpreted<00:00:28.320> from<00:00:28.470> your<00:00:28.650> voice<00:00:28.800> so<00:00:29.460> it

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:29.730 
interpreted from your voice so it

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:31.160 
interpreted from your voice so it
usually<00:00:30.000> does<00:00:30.330> a<00:00:30.359> good<00:00:30.539> job<00:00:30.599> we'll<00:00:30.990> go<00:00:31.080> ahead

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:31.170 
usually does a good job we'll go ahead

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:32.870 
usually does a good job we'll go ahead
and<00:00:31.289> give<00:00:31.410> it<00:00:31.529> a<00:00:31.710> try<00:00:31.949> here<00:00:32.279> see<00:00:32.489> how<00:00:32.610> it<00:00:32.700> works

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:32.880 
and give it a try here see how it works

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:35.660 
and give it a try here see how it works
this<00:00:33.450> is<00:00:33.600> a<00:00:33.630> free<00:00:34.079> app<00:00:34.260> so<00:00:35.070> might<00:00:35.309> as<00:00:35.399> well<00:00:35.489> give

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:35.670 
this is a free app so might as well give

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:40.610 
this is a free app so might as well give
it<00:00:35.700> a<00:00:35.790> try<00:00:36.140> and<00:00:38.780> another<00:00:39.780> quick<00:00:40.050> note<00:00:40.379> because

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
it a try and another quick note because

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:42.440 
it a try and another quick note because
I<00:00:40.770> mentioned<00:00:41.309> that<00:00:41.370> it<00:00:41.670> does<00:00:41.850> need<00:00:42.059> to<00:00:42.120> upload

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:42.450 
I mentioned that it does need to upload

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:45.260 
I mentioned that it does need to upload
the<00:00:42.690> information<00:00:43.430> right<00:00:44.430> then<00:00:44.670> and<00:00:44.789> there<00:00:44.850> to

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:45.270 
the information right then and there to

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:47.930 
the information right then and there to
the<00:00:45.750> server<00:00:45.989> to<00:00:46.260> analyze<00:00:46.620> your<00:00:46.800> voice<00:00:47.100> you<00:00:47.730> do

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
the server to analyze your voice you do

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:51.170 
the server to analyze your voice you do
need<00:00:48.090> to<00:00:48.149> be<00:00:48.600> connected<00:00:48.870> to<00:00:49.200> a<00:00:49.559> hotspot<00:00:50.180> Wi-Fi

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 
need to be connected to a hotspot Wi-Fi

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:55.910 
need to be connected to a hotspot Wi-Fi
or<00:00:52.010> have<00:00:53.010> access<00:00:53.219> with<00:00:53.789> a<00:00:53.820> 3g<00:00:54.500> model<00:00:55.500> to<00:00:55.890> a

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
or have access with a 3g model to a

00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:02.299 
or have access with a 3g model to a
cellular<00:00:56.550> tower<00:00:59.989> okay<00:01:00.989> again<00:01:01.440> so<00:01:01.680> here<00:01:02.010> we<00:01:02.129> are

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:02.309 
cellular tower okay again so here we are

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:04.880 
cellular tower okay again so here we are
we're<00:01:02.670> going<00:01:02.940> to<00:01:03.180> test<00:01:03.690> the<00:01:04.140> speech

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
we're going to test the speech

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:07.789 
we're going to test the speech
recognition<00:01:05.659> quality<00:01:06.659> of<00:01:06.810> the<00:01:07.409> dragon

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
recognition quality of the dragon

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:12.620 
recognition quality of the dragon
dictation<00:01:08.310> app<00:01:10.909> maybe<00:01:11.909> we<00:01:12.090> can<00:01:12.240> try<00:01:12.420> some

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
dictation app maybe we can try some

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:17.690 
dictation app maybe we can try some
numbers<00:01:12.990> as<00:01:13.140> well<00:01:13.170> one<00:01:14.070> two<00:01:14.939> three<00:01:15.210> four<00:01:16.700> five

six seven eight nine ten and if we had
to<00:01:25.140> remember<00:01:25.560> something<00:01:25.920> in<00:01:26.070> the<00:01:26.130> store<00:01:26.340> maybe

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:26.549 
to remember something in the store maybe

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:29.240 
to remember something in the store maybe
we<00:01:26.700> need<00:01:27.090> to<00:01:27.210> remember<00:01:27.659> to<00:01:27.840> buy<00:01:28.080> milk<00:01:28.619> eggs

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:39.250 
we need to remember to buy milk eggs
cookies<00:01:30.180> and<00:01:30.500> that's<00:01:31.500> it

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:39.260 

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:40.810 

and<00:01:39.680> I'm<00:01:39.920> going<00:01:40.040> to<00:01:40.070> go<00:01:40.160> and<00:01:40.280> read<00:01:40.430> it<00:01:40.460> okay

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:40.820 
and I'm going to go and read it okay

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:43.540 
and I'm going to go and read it okay
again<00:01:41.240> so<00:01:41.480> here<00:01:41.750> we<00:01:41.870> are<00:01:42.110> we're<00:01:42.890> going<00:01:43.190> to<00:01:43.310> test

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:43.550 
again so here we are we're going to test

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:45.820 
again so here we are we're going to test
the<00:01:43.760> speech<00:01:44.030> recognition<00:01:44.630> quality<00:01:45.230> of<00:01:45.440> the

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:45.830 
the speech recognition quality of the

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:48.190 
the speech recognition quality of the
dragon<00:01:46.250> dictation<00:01:46.610> app<00:01:46.940> maybe<00:01:47.570> we<00:01:47.840> can<00:01:48.020> try

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:48.200 
dragon dictation app maybe we can try

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:50.380 
dragon dictation app maybe we can try
some<00:01:48.470> numbers<00:01:48.830> as<00:01:48.980> well<00:01:49.010> one<00:01:49.790> two<00:01:49.970> three<00:01:50.210> four

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:50.390 
some numbers as well one two three four

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:52.960 
some numbers as well one two three four
five<00:01:50.570> six<00:01:50.870> seven<00:01:51.020> eight<00:01:51.410> nine<00:01:51.470> ten<00:01:52.040> and<00:01:52.220> if<00:01:52.790> we

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:52.970 
five six seven eight nine ten and if we

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:56.470 
five six seven eight nine ten and if we
had<00:01:53.510> to<00:01:53.720> remember<00:01:53.900> something<00:01:54.370> store<00:01:55.370> maybe<00:01:56.120> we

00:01:56.470 --> 00:01:56.480 
had to remember something store maybe we

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:59.170 
had to remember something store maybe we
need<00:01:56.810> to<00:01:57.080> remember<00:01:57.800> to<00:01:58.040> buy<00:01:58.310> milk<00:01:58.910> eggs

00:01:59.170 --> 00:01:59.180 
need to remember to buy milk eggs

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:00.880 
need to remember to buy milk eggs
cookies<00:01:59.630> and<00:01:59.870> that's<00:01:59.990> it<00:02:00.140> so<00:02:00.560> you<00:02:00.620> know<00:02:00.860> I

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:00.890 
cookies and that's it so you know I

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:03.420 
cookies and that's it so you know I
think<00:02:01.280> it<00:02:01.430> did<00:02:01.550> a<00:02:01.610> really<00:02:01.880> great<00:02:02.120> job<00:02:02.270> here<00:02:02.960> and

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:03.430 
think it did a really great job here and

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:05.650 
think it did a really great job here and
depending<00:02:04.430> on<00:02:04.640> the<00:02:04.760> background<00:02:04.970> noise<00:02:05.450> i

00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:05.660 
depending on the background noise i

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:08.560 
depending on the background noise i
think<00:02:05.870> it's<00:02:06.020> going<00:02:06.470> to<00:02:07.000> give<00:02:08.000> varying<00:02:08.390> results

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:08.570 
think it's going to give varying results

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:10.930 
think it's going to give varying results
but<00:02:09.560> other<00:02:09.740> than<00:02:09.830> that<00:02:10.160> I<00:02:10.550> think<00:02:10.580> this<00:02:10.760> is<00:02:10.910> a

00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:10.940 
but other than that I think this is a

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:14.980 
but other than that I think this is a
really<00:02:11.180> neat<00:02:11.450> productivity<00:02:12.080> tool<00:02:12.320> that<00:02:13.990> that

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:14.990 
really neat productivity tool that that

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:17.140 
really neat productivity tool that that
you<00:02:15.110> can<00:02:15.260> that<00:02:15.590> you<00:02:15.620> can<00:02:15.830> use<00:02:16.040> for<00:02:16.070> all<00:02:16.940> sorts

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:17.150 
you can that you can use for all sorts

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:18.940 
you can that you can use for all sorts
of<00:02:17.270> different<00:02:17.420> applications<00:02:17.830> what<00:02:18.830> is

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:18.950 
of different applications what is

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:20.440 
of different applications what is
something<00:02:19.190> else<00:02:19.490> we<00:02:19.640> can<00:02:19.670> do<00:02:19.940> here<00:02:19.970> we<00:02:20.300> can

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:20.450 
something else we can do here we can

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:21.850 
something else we can do here we can
also<00:02:20.600> email<00:02:21.050> it<00:02:21.440> publish<00:02:21.710> to<00:02:21.830> facebook

twitter copy it we can change the
settings<00:02:25.010> and<00:02:25.220> i<00:02:25.550> think<00:02:25.760> this<00:02:25.850> is<00:02:25.910> important

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:26.480 
settings and i think this is important

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:27.730 
settings and i think this is important
depending<00:02:26.660> on<00:02:26.870> what<00:02:26.990> language<00:02:27.380> so<00:02:27.590> can

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:27.740 
depending on what language so can

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:33.340 
depending on what language so can
analyze<00:02:28.100> it<00:02:28.280> properly<00:02:31.930> that's<00:02:32.930> about<00:02:33.170> it<00:02:33.200> i

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:33.350 
analyze it properly that's about it i

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:34.720 
analyze it properly that's about it i
think<00:02:33.560> the<00:02:33.680> end<00:02:33.920> of<00:02:34.070> speech<00:02:34.370> might<00:02:34.640> be

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:34.730 
think the end of speech might be

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:37.510 
think the end of speech might be
something<00:02:34.940> to<00:02:35.420> detect<00:02:35.900> stop<00:02:36.860> recording<00:02:37.220> and

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:37.520 
something to detect stop recording and

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:38.560 
something to detect stop recording and
then<00:02:37.610> upload<00:02:37.880> at<00:02:38.060> that<00:02:38.209> point<00:02:38.450> without

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:38.570 
then upload at that point without

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:41.650 
then upload at that point without
manually<00:02:39.200> hitting<00:02:39.440> stop<00:02:39.740> recording<00:02:40.540> okay<00:02:41.540> so

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:41.660 
manually hitting stop recording okay so

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:43.930 
manually hitting stop recording okay so
i<00:02:41.810> think<00:02:41.900> that's<00:02:42.110> a<00:02:42.170> pretty<00:02:42.320> neat<00:02:42.560> program<00:02:42.940> and

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:43.940 
i think that's a pretty neat program and

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:47.920 
i think that's a pretty neat program and
you<00:02:44.060> can't<00:02:44.330> beat<00:02:44.450> the<00:02:44.570> price<00:02:46.660> also<00:02:47.660> i<00:02:47.690> just

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:47.930 
you can't beat the price also i just

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:49.720 
you can't beat the price also i just
wanted<00:02:48.140> to<00:02:48.170> point<00:02:48.290> out<00:02:48.650> here<00:02:48.680> where<00:02:49.520> we<00:02:49.700> can

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:49.730 
wanted to point out here where we can

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:53.440 
wanted to point out here where we can
find<00:02:50.150> the<00:02:50.930> best<00:02:51.170> uses<00:02:51.890> so<00:02:52.520> it'll<00:02:52.760> have<00:02:52.790> a<00:02:52.940> speak

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:53.450 
find the best uses so it'll have a speak

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:55.360 
find the best uses so it'll have a speak
as<00:02:53.630> closely<00:02:53.900> to<00:02:54.320> the<00:02:54.440> mics<00:02:54.680> possible<00:02:55.250> which

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:55.370 
as closely to the mics possible which

00:02:55.370 --> 00:03:02.290 
as closely to the mics possible which
makes<00:02:55.610> sense<00:02:57.250> and<00:02:58.480> it<00:02:59.480> also<00:02:59.630> gives<00:03:01.300> commands

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:02.300 
makes sense and it also gives commands

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:05.650 
makes sense and it also gives commands
for<00:03:03.160> making<00:03:04.160> punctuation<00:03:04.790> and<00:03:04.850> so<00:03:05.000> forth<00:03:05.269> for

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:05.660 
for making punctuation and so forth for

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:09.759 
for making punctuation and so forth for
a<00:03:05.690> period<00:03:06.220> period<00:03:07.220> at<00:03:08.030> sign<00:03:08.470> to<00:03:09.470> make<00:03:09.620> that

00:03:09.759 --> 00:03:09.769 
a period period at sign to make that

00:03:09.769 --> 00:03:11.920 
a period period at sign to make that
sign<00:03:10.010> and<00:03:10.040> so<00:03:10.310> forth<00:03:10.580> so<00:03:11.120> if<00:03:11.390> you<00:03:11.510> go<00:03:11.690> here<00:03:11.900> and

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:11.930 
sign and so forth so if you go here and

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:15.310 
sign and so forth so if you go here and
learn<00:03:12.140> a<00:03:12.200> little<00:03:12.410> bit<00:03:12.530> then<00:03:13.130> you<00:03:14.200> imagine<00:03:15.200> you

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:15.320 
learn a little bit then you imagine you

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:17.350 
learn a little bit then you imagine you
could<00:03:15.410> almost<00:03:15.560> right<00:03:16.160> dictate<00:03:16.790> your<00:03:16.880> own<00:03:17.060> book

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:17.360 
could almost right dictate your own book
