up<00:01:45.750> with<00:01:45.990> influenza<00:01:46.590> maybe<00:01:47.460> a<00:01:47.579> reactivation

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060 
up with influenza maybe a reactivation

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:50.480 
up with influenza maybe a reactivation
of<00:01:48.240> latent<00:01:48.540> tuberculosis<00:01:49.250> perhaps<00:01:50.250> the

of latent tuberculosis perhaps the

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:53.690 
of latent tuberculosis perhaps the
cytomegalovirus<00:01:50.880> or<00:01:51.750> maybe<00:01:52.470> it<00:01:53.159> was<00:01:53.310> just<00:01:53.340> one

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700 
cytomegalovirus or maybe it was just one

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:55.780 
cytomegalovirus or maybe it was just one
of<00:01:53.759> literally<00:01:54.450> hundreds<00:01:54.960> of<00:01:55.049> bacteria

00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:55.790

viruses and fungi that can cause fever

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:01.249 
viruses and fungi that can cause fever
in<00:01:59.040> immunocompromised<00:01:59.310> Nations<00:02:00.180> it<00:02:00.960> was<00:02:01.110> up

00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:01.259 
in immunocompromised Nations it was up

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:03.050 
in immunocompromised Nations it was up
to<00:02:01.380> the<00:02:01.469> Mount<00:02:01.680> Sinai<00:02:01.950> team<00:02:02.369> to<00:02:02.759> narrow<00:02:03.000> down

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:03.060 
to the Mount Sinai team to narrow down

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:05.020 
to the Mount Sinai team to narrow down
the<00:02:03.689> differential

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:05.030 
the differential

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:08.710 
the differential
so<00:02:05.990> what<00:02:06.200> should<00:02:06.320> we<00:02:06.500> do<00:02:06.710> now<00:02:06.920> what<00:02:07.820> what

00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:08.720 
so what should we do now what what

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:14.860 
so what should we do now what what
should<00:02:09.020> we<00:02:09.200> do<00:02:09.500> now<00:02:09.830> oh<00:02:10.450> I<00:02:12.340> don't<00:02:13.340> know<00:02:13.430> I<00:02:13.870> guess

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:14.870 
should we do now oh I don't know I guess

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:18.820 
should we do now oh I don't know I guess
we<00:02:15.050> should<00:02:15.200> do<00:02:15.260> a<00:02:15.290> gram<00:02:15.530> stain<00:02:16.510> huh<00:02:17.510> I<00:02:17.840> don't

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:18.830 
we should do a gram stain huh I don't

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:21.670 
we should do a gram stain huh I don't
see<00:02:18.950> anything<00:02:19.130> on<00:02:19.340> this<00:02:19.459> Gram<00:02:19.700> stain<00:02:20.680> doctor

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:21.680 
see anything on this Gram stain doctor

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:23.620 
see anything on this Gram stain doctor
there's<00:02:21.860> no<00:02:22.040> slide<00:02:22.400> in<00:02:22.640> the<00:02:22.730> microscope<00:02:23.360> and

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:23.630 
there's no slide in the microscope and

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:32.920 
there's no slide in the microscope and
it's<00:02:24.590> not<00:02:24.739> even<00:02:24.770> turned<00:02:25.160> on<00:02:28.900> huh<00:02:30.640> so<00:02:31.640> we<00:02:32.270> try

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:32.930 
it's not even turned on huh so we try

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:35.890 
it's not even turned on huh so we try
due<00:02:32.989> to<00:02:33.230> the<00:02:33.350> Gram<00:02:33.590> stain<00:02:33.800> but<00:02:34.690> you<00:02:35.690> know<00:02:35.780> we

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:35.900 
due to the Gram stain but you know we

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:38.050 
due to the Gram stain but you know we
couldn't<00:02:36.110> see<00:02:36.319> anything<00:02:36.590> my<00:02:37.519> guess<00:02:37.850> is<00:02:37.880> that

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:38.060 
couldn't see anything my guess is that

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:39.729 
couldn't see anything my guess is that
they<00:02:38.300> were<00:02:38.420> just<00:02:38.540> wasn't<00:02:38.840> enough<00:02:38.900> bacteria<00:02:39.440> in

00:02:39.729 --> 00:02:39.739 
they were just wasn't enough bacteria in

00:02:39.739 --> 00:02:42.040 
they were just wasn't enough bacteria in
the<00:02:39.890> blood<00:02:40.090> now<00:02:41.090> for<00:02:41.150> any<00:02:41.420> other<00:02:41.600> reason<00:02:41.720> of

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:42.050 
the blood now for any other reason of

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:43.360 
the blood now for any other reason of
course<00:02:42.080> I<00:02:42.440> mean<00:02:42.620> I<00:02:42.709> mean<00:02:42.890> I'm<00:02:43.010> an<00:02:43.130> excellent

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:43.370 
course I mean I mean I'm an excellent

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:46.180 
course I mean I mean I'm an excellent
technician<00:02:43.910> so<00:02:44.120> probably<00:02:44.570> that<00:02:45.070> in<00:02:46.070> the

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:46.190 
technician so probably that in the

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:47.770 
technician so probably that in the
meantime<00:02:46.370> I<00:02:46.580> guess<00:02:46.880> we<00:02:47.000> should<00:02:47.150> try<00:02:47.330> and<00:02:47.390> you

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:47.780 
meantime I guess we should try and you

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:49.150 
meantime I guess we should try and you
know<00:02:47.840> grow<00:02:48.080> some<00:02:48.230> cultures<00:02:48.620> on<00:02:48.800> some<00:02:48.980> blood<00:02:49.130> I

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:49.160 
know grow some cultures on some blood I

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:50.820 
know grow some cultures on some blood I
gars<00:02:49.519> and<00:02:49.850> see<00:02:50.239> if<00:02:50.330> we<00:02:50.390> can<00:02:50.480> grow<00:02:50.600> anything

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:50.830 
gars and see if we can grow anything

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:53.670 
gars and see if we can grow anything

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:53.680 
what they found were both shocked and

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:57.400 
what they found were both shocked and
obey<00:02:54.680> few<00:02:55.120> since<00:02:56.120> the<00:02:56.239> patient<00:02:56.630> had<00:02:56.810> a<00:02:56.840> central

line and developed a fever in the
hospital<00:02:59.390> nosocomial<00:03:00.260> infections<00:03:01.130> were

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:01.310 
hospital nosocomial infections were

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:04.150 
hospital nosocomial infections were
pretty<00:03:01.580> high<00:03:01.790> on<00:03:01.819> differential<00:03:02.890> this<00:03:03.890> is<00:03:04.010> our

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:04.160 
pretty high on differential this is our

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:06.640 
pretty high on differential this is our
McConkey<00:03:04.670> plate<00:03:04.910> you<00:03:05.750> didn't<00:03:05.989> grow<00:03:06.170> so<00:03:06.440> we<00:03:06.500> can

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:06.650 
McConkey plate you didn't grow so we can

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:09.449 
McConkey plate you didn't grow so we can
probably<00:03:06.950> rule<00:03:07.069> out<00:03:07.280> e.coli<00:03:07.940> Salmonella

00:03:09.449 --> 00:03:09.459 
probably rule out e.coli Salmonella

00:03:09.459 --> 00:03:15.780

under my house is an Ag plate ah we knew
it<00:03:23.330> wasn't<00:03:23.480> gonna<00:03:23.630> grow<00:03:23.870> because<00:03:24.200> I<00:03:24.230> didn't

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:24.380 
it wasn't gonna grow because I didn't

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:26.620 
it wasn't gonna grow because I didn't
grow<00:03:24.500> in<00:03:24.560> the<00:03:24.620> McConkey<00:03:25.130> but<00:03:25.370> I<00:03:25.580> just<00:03:26.330> like<00:03:26.480> the

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:26.630 
grow in the McConkey but I just like the

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:31.120 
grow in the McConkey but I just like the
color<00:03:27.040> green<00:03:28.990> uh-huh<00:03:29.990> and<00:03:30.530> then<00:03:30.590> this<00:03:31.010> is<00:03:31.100> a

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:31.130 
color green uh-huh and then this is a

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:34.690 
color green uh-huh and then this is a
cornmeal<00:03:31.700> Rygaard<00:03:32.530> blasted<00:03:33.530> nothing<00:03:34.520> yet

cornmeal Rygaard blasted nothing yet
here<00:03:35.030> but<00:03:35.180> at<00:03:35.930> least<00:03:36.110> we<00:03:36.260> could<00:03:36.350> rule<00:03:36.500> out

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:36.650 
here but at least we could rule out

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:39.310 
here but at least we could rule out
fungi<00:03:37.600> see<00:03:38.600> the<00:03:38.690> nice<00:03:38.810> thing<00:03:39.050> about<00:03:39.080> a
