00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:07.800
 as for him in the world I realize that I have 30 years carpenter in 

00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:08.700
 green building 

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:11.570
 we worked in a cooperative society called servant for 

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:14.099
 apprentices who aligned seven years 

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:17.359
 my job is to develop the attic create living spaces 

00:00:17.359 --> 00:00:19.859
 in the battles that were not inhabited could create a solid to 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:20.529
 play hockey 

00:00:20.529 --> 00:00:24.249
 to make liz hurley frame renovations the frame we see europe 

00:00:24.249 --> 00:00:27.460
 of new construction offered the framework of a classic house info 

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:30.509
 also do wood houses so at that time we made heroes made of 

00:00:30.509 --> 00:00:33.509
 best made the entrances the frame 

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:37.640
 that's what motivated me to choose eco-construction is my way of 

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:41.740
 life is a little green I'm more attracted to the same simple goal 

00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:45.120
 and buildings that respect the environment while in buildings 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:47.620
 classified are going to be able to do things that are not necessarily 

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:50.550
 great for the environment there in eco-building we have a reflection 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:54.780
 someone more in-depth and we try to get them to do things a little bit 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:56.470
 better 

00:00:56.470 --> 00:00:58.220
 Putin 

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:59.770
 power 

00:00:59.770 --> 00:01:04.140
 why a layer of mud the new wood crafts that goes untreated 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:05.170
 chemical 

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:08.170
 we use wood that is naturally resistant 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:25.770
 for example a wooden structure for to accommodate bales of 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:29.420
 straw a straw house we place a structure that is a bit peculiar 

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:33.380
 but it is necessary to study according to the function of the material m 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:38.250
 but the small nuances that a specific point about does not have too much 

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:41.760
 there we push a little education a little more 

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:45.930
 qualities required to practice this profession there are several like a little the 

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:48.540
 physical work it's beautiful it's a lot of physical work the ifo is 

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:51.910
 also thoughtful enough because when you make a house or a wooden house 

00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:54.840
 round arriving at the very beginning we are the first to intervene for the 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:58.070
 second what nations actually did the slab often slab even 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:01.759
 they showed us to the world only one turkey after him having to 

00:02:01.759 --> 00:02:05.140
 to work a whole bunch of trades and jewels posing 

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:07.620
 electricians the plumbers in the evening after 

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:10.909
 and so we have some responsibility for 

00:02:10.909 --> 00:02:13.609
 to do things well in the beginning for easter 

00:02:13.609 --> 00:02:16.609
 so that it does not happen afterwards wind 

00:02:18.419 --> 00:02:21.419
 he cuts 

00:02:22.189 --> 00:02:25.710
 several classic courses and Gilles simon traditional 

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:28.859
 before that I spent a v8 and mechanical 

00:02:28.859 --> 00:02:31.819
 mechanical engineering the ogm pu learn the drawing 

00:02:31.819 --> 00:02:35.299
 exercise them in design office how four years I was doing the structure 

00:02:35.299 --> 00:02:36.849
 metallic at the level of the senses 

00:02:36.849 --> 00:02:39.310
 but later I did a professional training that taught me 

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:42.009
 taken to the carpenter trade 

00:02:42.009 --> 00:02:44.369
 have carpenter at dacia cetacean hunting 

00:02:44.369 --> 00:02:45.469
 developments on two 

00:02:45.469 --> 00:02:49.479
 take the most responsibilities upstream of the works of 

00:02:49.479 --> 00:02:51.039
 through but to challenge the truce 

00:02:51.039 --> 00:02:54.249
 I think I have a moment when the physics there I crack 

00:02:55.029 --> 00:02:58.049
 we will move more to the side of studies 

00:02:58.049 --> 00:03:01.810
 and if it was to redo raffarin his people 

00:03:03.089 --> 00:03:07.419
 offers in progress ap 29 09 30

 the earth compresses it they made big bricks that are very heavy 

00:03:50.689 --> 00:03:52.389
 who could not diversified 

00:03:52.389 --> 00:03:54.539
 a little sister of the runner's marat 

00:03:54.539 --> 00:03:56.899
 certainly we can we must quantify 

00:03:56.899 --> 00:03:59.899
 too hot too cold that restores the heat that I am depending on the weather 

00:04:00.679 --> 00:04:02.139
 I will be the stone 

00:04:02.139 --> 00:04:04.919
 what openings are made and an investigation opened 

00:04:04.919 --> 00:04:07.409
 different types of stones on size cars 

00:04:07.409 --> 00:04:12.650
 according to the roll the metro did not have the jersey the pierre montpellier 

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:14.379
 one of the multiples 

00:04:14.379 --> 00:04:16.719
 people bought doors 

00:04:16.719 --> 00:04:20.209
 work very little wood we are still to make boats 

00:04:20.209 --> 00:04:23.080
 the idea of ​​imposing the tomette of the terracotta 

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:26.059
 all that with hot mâcon lyon the choice is 

00:04:26.059 --> 00:04:27.210

 my job as a builder eco-construction 

00:04:28.969 --> 00:04:32.270
 and I resistant who no longer have more flexible work 

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:38.129
 she agrees better on Monday against the intensity degrade little girl

 he lets breathe 

00:04:40.009 --> 00:04:42.330
 but alive with fire

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:47.759
 vegetal 

00:04:47.759 --> 00:04:49.889
 and it gives me a feeling of 

00:04:49.889 --> 00:04:52.889
 of heat water he calculated that at 

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:57.669
 in europe is to do all this and also to organize simply 

00:04:57.669 --> 00:04:59.729
 nevertheless the provisional planning 

00:04:59.729 --> 00:05:01.999
 to follow the construction sites 

00:05:01.999 --> 00:05:03.909
 it was organized 

00:05:03.909 --> 00:05:05.020
 the smooth 

00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:08.020
 a beautiful building site 

00:05:11.789 --> 00:05:15.129
 I followed the stonemason training the federation compagnonnique 

00:05:15.129 --> 00:05:18.589
 building trades in saint-sébastien-sur-loire 

00:05:18.589 --> 00:05:21.599
 alternately account that I was nature inhabitants 

00:05:21.599 --> 00:05:24.180
 the leader of this formation trusted us 

00:05:24.180 --> 00:05:27.250
 exciting this training I continued with 

00:05:27.250 --> 00:05:29.110
 my colleagues me 

00:05:29.110 --> 00:05:32.110
 to work to take with them a combo of 

00:05:33.009 --> 00:05:34.419
 the technical part 

00:05:34.419 --> 00:05:36.910
 launching training is already achieved

 m family and rural town house 

00:05:40.129 --> 00:05:44.789
 6% a training eco-construction much more oriented on the house 

00:05:44.789 --> 00:05:45.919
 flakes 

00:05:45.919 --> 00:05:49.039
 the starting idea of ​​saint-sernin 

00:05:49.039 --> 00:05:52.669
 what makes a formation in cdi masonry courtial 

00:05:53.439 --> 00:05:56.439
 with an eco-construction option 

00:06:04.539 --> 00:06:08.469
 the quality listed raw materials on the organization must be 

00:06:08.469 --> 00:06:09.960
 be organized 

00:06:09.960 --> 00:06:13.259
 the party has in mind first we must think about what we do

 the save 

00:06:17.460 --> 00:06:19.750
 then physically he will go after eight months 

00:06:19.750 --> 00:06:21.589
 to say that because it's at work 

00:06:21.589 --> 00:06:24.589
 22nd perseverance so these patrons 

00:06:26.110 --> 00:06:27.279
 but beware 

00:06:27.279 --> 00:06:30.339
 watch out for yourself pay attention to his teammates

 I like to work 

00:06:42.180 --> 00:06:43.539
 with the weather 

00:06:43.539 --> 00:06:45.509
 climatic constraints 

00:06:45.509 --> 00:06:47.139
 on our physical arrival 

00:06:47.139 --> 00:06:49.809
 I like the touch contact with the material 

00:06:49.809 --> 00:06:54.459
 awesome the magic of the transformation of something better the vikings 

00:06:54.459 --> 00:06:59.119
 pasty that becomes hard to fashion you pseudonym that does not want to work to the good 

00:06:59.119 --> 00:07:00.710
 moment he worked 

00:07:00.710 --> 00:07:02.599
 a natural material 

00:07:02.599 --> 00:07:05.599
 according to the place of burial 38 

00:07:06.539 --> 00:07:08.749
 la France 

00:07:08.749 --> 00:07:11.740
 to do this 

00:07:11.740 --> 00:07:13.649
 la France 

00:07:13.649 --> 00:07:16.929
 Why
