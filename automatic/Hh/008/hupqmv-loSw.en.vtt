charge that and use this one hopefully

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:35.510 
charge that and use this one hopefully

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.380 
and one of the things about this camera

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:24.140 
and one of the things about this camera
that<00:01:22.650> you<00:01:22.710> may<00:01:22.950> be<00:01:23.009> able<00:01:23.189> to<00:01:23.310> tell<00:01:23.549> by<00:01:23.729> now<00:01:23.939> is

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150 
that you may be able to tell by now is

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:28.700 
that you may be able to tell by now is
that<00:01:24.180> it<00:01:24.450> doesn't<00:01:24.689> have<00:01:24.810> quite<00:01:25.200> the<00:01:25.950> M<00:01:27.590> it<00:01:28.590> has

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
that it doesn't have quite the M it has

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:34.219 
that it doesn't have quite the M it has
more<00:01:28.920> of<00:01:29.009> a<00:01:29.100> zoomed<00:01:29.369> in<00:01:29.670> effect<00:01:33.049> when<00:01:34.049> it's

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:34.229 
more of a zoomed in effect when it's

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:36.530 
more of a zoomed in effect when it's
just<00:01:34.380> normally<00:01:34.860> normally<00:01:35.790> turned<00:01:36.150> on<00:01:36.299> so<00:01:36.479> I

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:36.540 
just normally normally turned on so I

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:41.120 
just normally normally turned on so I
can't<00:01:36.840> help<00:01:37.829> that<00:01:38.100> but<00:01:39.350> quality<00:01:40.350> is<00:01:40.710> pretty

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.130 
can't help that but quality is pretty

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:46.520 
can't help that but quality is pretty
decent<00:01:41.640> it<00:01:42.329> just<00:01:42.659> meets<00:01:45.049> so<00:01:46.049> I<00:01:46.079> had<00:01:46.259> this<00:01:46.350> lot<00:01:46.500> a

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.530 
decent it just meets so I had this lot a

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:49.010 
decent it just meets so I had this lot a
lot<00:01:46.680> before<00:01:46.860> and<00:01:47.670> I<00:01:47.909> just<00:01:47.939> repackaged<00:01:48.720> it<00:01:48.840> real

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
lot before and I just repackaged it real

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:52.280 
lot before and I just repackaged it real
quick<00:01:49.229> or<00:01:49.380> Reeboks<00:01:49.710> there<00:01:49.950> real<00:01:50.070> quick<00:01:51.290> there

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:52.290 
quick or Reeboks there real quick there

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:53.929 
quick or Reeboks there real quick there
is<00:01:52.500> hopefully<00:01:52.890> the<00:01:52.920> focus<00:01:53.549> works<00:01:53.729> on<00:01:53.880> this

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:53.939 
is hopefully the focus works on this

00:01:53.939 --> 00:02:06.740 
is hopefully the focus works on this
camera<00:01:54.180> pretty<00:01:54.390> well

00:04:39.170 --> 00:04:39.180 
series by Gemini Jets really is one of

00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:42.980 
series by Gemini Jets really is one of
their<00:04:39.300> best<00:04:39.480> aircraft<00:04:39.690> in<00:04:40.140> my<00:04:40.230> opinion<00:04:41.990> the

00:04:42.980 --> 00:04:42.990 
their best aircraft in my opinion the

00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:44.930 
their best aircraft in my opinion the
only<00:04:43.260> kind<00:04:43.650> of<00:04:43.770> problem<00:04:44.280> a<00:04:44.310> little<00:04:44.580> bit<00:04:44.790> of<00:04:44.880> a

00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:44.940 
only kind of problem a little bit of a

00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:46.909 
only kind of problem a little bit of a
problem<00:04:45.180> that<00:04:45.270> I<00:04:45.419> have<00:04:45.630> with<00:04:45.930> the<00:04:46.320> Gemini<00:04:46.680> just

00:04:46.909 --> 00:04:46.919 
problem that I have with the Gemini just

00:04:46.919 --> 00:04:48.830 
problem that I have with the Gemini just
seven<00:04:47.130> three<00:04:47.280> sevens<00:04:47.669> it's<00:04:48.150> very<00:04:48.360> minor<00:04:48.690> but

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:48.840 
seven three sevens it's very minor but

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:51.610 
seven three sevens it's very minor but
you<00:04:49.560> see<00:04:49.740> here<00:04:49.860> I'm<00:04:49.980> gonna<00:04:50.130> lightly<00:04:50.640> touch<00:04:50.910> the

00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:51.620 
you see here I'm gonna lightly touch the

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:54.830 
you see here I'm gonna lightly touch the
tail<00:04:52.620> piece<00:04:52.860> and<00:04:53.160> it'll<00:04:53.880> lean<00:04:54.180> back<00:04:54.419> like<00:04:54.690> that

00:04:54.830 --> 00:04:54.840 
tail piece and it'll lean back like that

00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:59.060 
tail piece and it'll lean back like that
and<00:04:55.080> sometimes<00:04:55.530> like<00:04:56.930> when<00:04:57.930> I<00:04:57.960> go<00:04:58.620> to<00:04:58.680> sleep<00:04:58.860> at

00:04:59.060 --> 00:04:59.070 
and sometimes like when I go to sleep at

00:04:59.070 --> 00:05:00.380 
and sometimes like when I go to sleep at
night<00:04:59.100> I<00:04:59.220> have<00:04:59.430> on<00:04:59.580> bottle<00:04:59.880> collection<00:05:00.150> is

00:05:00.380 --> 00:05:00.390 
night I have on bottle collection is

00:05:00.390 --> 00:05:02.420 
night I have on bottle collection is
just<00:05:00.570> kind<00:05:00.720> of<00:05:00.780> sit<00:05:00.900> next<00:05:01.020> to<00:05:01.140> me<00:05:01.230> and<00:05:01.310> it'll<00:05:02.310> be

00:05:02.420 --> 00:05:02.430 
just kind of sit next to me and it'll be

00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:04.580 
just kind of sit next to me and it'll be
sitting<00:05:02.730> like<00:05:02.880> this<00:05:03.080> when<00:05:04.080> I<00:05:04.110> fall<00:05:04.320> asleep<00:05:04.350> and

00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:04.590 
sitting like this when I fall asleep and

00:05:04.590 --> 00:05:06.320 
sitting like this when I fall asleep and
I<00:05:04.680> wake<00:05:04.830> up<00:05:04.860> in<00:05:05.100> the<00:05:05.160> morning<00:05:05.490> and<00:05:05.669> it's<00:05:05.910> like

00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:06.330 
I wake up in the morning and it's like

00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:08.060 
I wake up in the morning and it's like
this<00:05:06.600> so<00:05:06.870> it<00:05:06.990> falls<00:05:07.230> over<00:05:07.410> really<00:05:07.800> easily

00:05:08.060 --> 00:05:08.070 
this so it falls over really easily

00:05:08.070 --> 00:05:10.250 
this so it falls over really easily
really<00:05:08.460> undisturbed<00:05:09.390> it<00:05:09.570> may<00:05:09.690> just<00:05:09.870> lean<00:05:10.050> back

00:05:10.250 --> 00:05:10.260 
really undisturbed it may just lean back

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:12.500 
really undisturbed it may just lean back
but<00:05:10.500> it<00:05:10.710> sits<00:05:11.040> straight<00:05:11.280> how<00:05:12.060> it<00:05:12.180> normally

00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:12.510 
but it sits straight how it normally

00:05:12.510 --> 00:05:15.200 
but it sits straight how it normally
should<00:05:13.040> most<00:05:14.040> of<00:05:14.190> the<00:05:14.250> time<00:05:14.430> so<00:05:14.790> it's<00:05:14.910> not<00:05:15.030> too

00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:15.210 
should most of the time so it's not too

00:05:15.210 --> 00:05:17.060 
should most of the time so it's not too
much<00:05:15.360> of<00:05:15.479> a<00:05:15.540> problem<00:05:15.750> but<00:05:16.710> I<00:05:16.740> just<00:05:16.950> thought

00:05:17.060 --> 00:05:17.070 
much of a problem but I just thought

00:05:17.070 --> 00:05:20.180 
much of a problem but I just thought
that<00:05:17.250> was<00:05:17.370> kind<00:05:18.300> of<00:05:18.330> interesting<00:05:19.190> anyways

00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:20.190 
that was kind of interesting anyways
