00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:08.400
 hello you love it goes great 

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:09.900
 Walked on the winter to the days 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:11.849
 getting shorter is always getting 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:14.849
 colder and who leads with the most 

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:17.039
 including our skin and therefore have 

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:18.869
 I meant today have to have something for you 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:21.090
 Care and cosmetics are a lot of fun 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:23.369
 First, I have my world here 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:25.400
 peace with a care stick is the 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:27.750
 made entirely of natural ingredients 

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:30.359
 this one is just honey too 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:32.820
 is still with peppermint or with 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:34.829
 mango or something else but me 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:36.960
 drive with the only honey best 

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:38.399
 that's really the best 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:40.379
 lip care stick I've ever had 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:42.510
 I still had or I still have 

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:44.969
 creme de roos of dior the is 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:47.039
 wonderful to have just like that 

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:48.930
 but would like to have a luxurious feeling 

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:49.649
 for the perfect care effect 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:52.110
 achieve 

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:53.309
 So far nothing has come to me 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:55.559
 answers kiess ran 

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:58.859
 my day care is actually that 

00:00:55.559 --> 00:01:01.379
 whole year of ollis lay concentrated 

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:04.110
 cream is suitable for every skin type 

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:06.720
 there are still parts of the city instead 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:09.090
 the blue here is the red there is still 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:11.010
 Such a cream for extremely dry skin 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:13.380
 It's me though I'm super dry and 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:15.299
 from oak to agreement I get 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:18.060
 pimple so i do not take her but 

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:19.170
 drive here with really good that 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:22.470
 next you do not give up 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:24.299
 In winter, hand care should be here 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:27.060
 is a hand cream of gamers glory the 

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:29.000
 Helmut's name is smelling great super good 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:32.189
 And the care effect is good too 

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:34.740
 Never had a bird chirping that 

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:37.500
 the texture was changed and not 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:39.570
 smells more so good i dont know if that 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:40.950
 So I agree with the 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:43.740
 Cream broken my colleagues 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:45.899
 bought new and you really did 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:47.759
 not good knead the smelt total of 

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:50.040
 no others, whether they 're bad 

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:52.979
 was the cream or she just one 

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:55.049
 I had no product on Mondays 

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:56.549
 as definitely not the cream 

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:59.040
 actually great even good 

00:01:56.549 --> 00:02:00.850
 but if I do not follow anymore 

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:03.700
 I did not want to do it before 

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:05.290
 but otherwise even if you do not 

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:08.080
 May the rough pick you up easily 

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:09.610
 any hand cream that cares well 

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:11.050
 We should take care of the hands 

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:13.209
 Do not forget feet that will 

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:15.610
 also dry in winter and have it 

00:02:13.209 --> 00:02:17.980
 I here from hansaplast food expert 

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:19.989
 the anti horn have intense cream 

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:23.050
 I actually bought with the drive 

00:02:19.989 --> 00:02:25.050
 very good so the moist donated 

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:27.989
 my house pretty much moisture 

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:30.730
 and yes I think great 

00:02:27.989 --> 00:02:33.370
 because I get extremely flaky skin 

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:36.069
 Winter just got around the nose 

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:38.739
 I aloud to me from gamblers enough luxair 

00:02:36.069 --> 00:02:41.739
 I get a peeling with it, too 

00:02:38.739 --> 00:02:43.510
 quite well that heats up so on the 

00:02:41.739 --> 00:02:45.190
 Haut and I think it is actually a 

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:46.780
 maybe a pleasant feeling is 

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:48.940
 not for everyone but for me it is 

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:50.440
 a great feeling on the skin and me 

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:53.350
 I really like the care 

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:55.120
 effect is thus of the beneficial effect 

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:57.100
 it's also good you just have to pay attention 

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:58.900
 that the skin of highly wear that 

00:02:57.100 --> 00:03:01.810
 really lotion up right after that 

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:03.850
 otherwise the skin is extremely exciting then 

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:06.100
 let's get to the cosmetics I 'll give you 

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:07.540
 to wane strongly in winter right 

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:09.310
 but also sometimes with 

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:11.079
 neutral colors you can use 

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:12.280
 yes make up and that's why 

00:03:11.079 --> 00:03:14.380
 l think lately always 

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:16.900
 more often back to my corner palette 

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:21.010
 Almost every one of you knows that, I think 

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:23.950
 times shimmering and one here 

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:26.290
 few dull think yes michael for example 

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:27.850
 is matt and back is also matt in the 

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:31.989
 left my favorite sounds of it 

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:34.420
 Merkel and Barack and with them you can 

00:03:31.989 --> 00:03:36.790
 Make-up is everywhere 

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:39.340
 the naked palette is quite popular 

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:41.380
 you can win them wonderful colors 

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:43.120
 always very good too 

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:45.040
 Christmas the naked palettes want 

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:45.700
 that he is now the third regular palette 

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:47.920
 came out 

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:51.070
 I do not know if I really need it 

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:54.040
 because I already have 32 nails palettes and the 

00:03:51.070 --> 00:03:56.950
 naked basics have palette but there are 

00:03:54.040 --> 00:04:00.519
 just like collectibles and this too 

00:03:56.950 --> 00:04:03.299
 super soft should not agree again 

00:04:00.519 --> 00:04:06.730
 with cosmetics cuddling by the camera 

00:04:03.299 --> 00:04:09.390
 i love love love love love the 

00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:13.410
 mac plage in experience 

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:15.340
 I have had it for two or three weeks 

00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:16.840
 worn continuously 

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:18.940
 I also had him in my favorites 

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:22.150
 shown at my level 

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:24.390
 And that's just the perfect color 

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:26.110
 my other industry is already like this 

00:04:24.390 --> 00:04:29.350
 neglected because I just always 

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:32.020
 just wear it but it's the perfect one 

00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:34.210
 it was really it is not so 

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:35.020
 extremely I have it today is not 

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:39.010
 so extreme 

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:40.300
 not too pink and I can not 

00:04:39.010 --> 00:04:42.130
 stop being too serious if I am 

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:44.400
 someday my drogerie practiced for it 

00:04:42.130 --> 00:04:47.370
 I will let you know 

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:49.630
 the next thing I show you is no 

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:51.910
 product in itself but rather one 

00:04:49.630 --> 00:04:54.550
 product category and that are the green 

00:04:51.910 --> 00:04:56.560
 power blanches this is from patrice 

00:04:54.550 --> 00:04:58.200
 That was a limited edition fund before 

00:04:56.560 --> 00:05:03.010
 about a year or so 

00:04:58.200 --> 00:05:04.960
 and yes I love that consistency that 

00:05:03.010 --> 00:05:06.310
 is thus fits nicely into the skin-a 

00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:08.500
 and if you really can 

00:05:06.310 --> 00:05:10.930
 times in winter dry skin has 

00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:12.520
 I'm perfect with that very much 

00:05:10.930 --> 00:05:15.340
 to make cream consistencies already with 

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:17.290
 powder consistency and that's it 

00:05:15.340 --> 00:05:19.660
 perfect then we come to mine 

00:05:17.290 --> 00:05:22.180
 Dearest nail polishes I love muted 

00:05:19.660 --> 00:05:24.340
 red in combination with gold in the 

00:05:22.180 --> 00:05:26.410
 Winter time and I have it here now 

00:05:24.340 --> 00:05:27.990
 representative fishnet stalkings of 

00:05:26.410 --> 00:05:31.690
 Every one of them is the perfect one 

00:05:27.990 --> 00:05:33.340
 red for the winter time is currently available 

00:05:31.690 --> 00:05:35.530
 Again, there were only in the limited 

00:05:33.340 --> 00:05:37.300
 I think about edition about one year ago 

00:05:35.530 --> 00:05:37.900
 then came even more in the limited 

00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:39.850
 edition 

00:05:37.900 --> 00:05:41.440
 I've got you but now at the miller 

00:05:39.850 --> 00:05:43.950
 example, we have these giant se 

00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:46.450
 Theke also have it there permanently 

00:05:43.950 --> 00:05:48.640
 I can put you only to the heart is 

00:05:46.450 --> 00:05:53.200
 really the perfect red and that 

00:05:48.640 --> 00:05:57.610
 I have my favorite gold here 

00:05:53.200 --> 00:06:01.560
 glitter curl once I have here from 

00:05:57.610 --> 00:06:06.640

 for making lilly was last year too 

00:06:06.640 --> 00:06:10.960
 a limited edition i believe i have 

00:06:09.370 --> 00:06:13.180
 but this year again in the 

00:06:10.960 --> 00:06:15.420
 counter seen in series there are indeed synonymous 

00:06:13.180 --> 00:06:15.420
 at müller 

00:06:15.940 --> 00:06:24.790
 then I have patrice dinos too 

00:06:21.880 --> 00:06:25.890
 once again limited edition went well 

00:06:24.790 --> 00:06:28.630

00:06:25.890 --> 00:06:30.400
 medium-sized if not everything 

00:06:28.630 --> 00:06:32.320
 but I also fooled with patrice 

00:06:30.400 --> 00:06:33.730
 a gold glitter in the standard range 

00:06:32.320 --> 00:06:39.790
 you have to see each other in any case 

00:06:33.730 --> 00:06:43.150
 Let's have a look then I have from p21 

00:06:39.790 --> 00:06:47.530
 window in the color is 100 precious 

00:06:43.150 --> 00:06:50.230
 Definitely standard range and 

00:06:47.530 --> 00:06:53.560
 then I have the still from the ironman 

00:06:50.230 --> 00:06:57.610
 boom boom pow d he has 24 karat gold 

00:06:53.560 --> 00:06:58.960
 we did not have to have it in there but me 

00:06:57.610 --> 00:07:01.960
 got it for free and that's why 

00:06:58.960 --> 00:07:03.640
 is it a great luxury object what hair 

00:07:01.960 --> 00:07:05.290
 At home in the winter 

00:07:03.640 --> 00:07:06.850
 really stop 

00:07:05.290 --> 00:07:08.950
 I did not have that last year 

00:07:06.850 --> 00:07:11.230
 but with this year have become 

00:07:08.950 --> 00:07:15.700
 Honestly proven to me that the 

00:07:11.230 --> 00:07:18.130
 it was as good as the oil allah and me 

00:07:15.700 --> 00:07:19.900
 I'll do it without deadline 

00:07:18.130 --> 00:07:21.910
 otherwise it was winter time 

00:07:19.900 --> 00:07:23.919
 because it's really hair really 

00:07:21.910 --> 00:07:25.540
