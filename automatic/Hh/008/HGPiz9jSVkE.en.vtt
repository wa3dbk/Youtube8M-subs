00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:26.210 
pictures of the back so I just kind of

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:29.140 
pictures of the back so I just kind of
winged<00:02:26.450> it<00:02:26.600> and<00:02:26.750> made<00:02:26.900> it<00:02:26.930> like<00:02:27.140> that

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:29.150

winged it and made it like that
and<00:02:30.340> yeah<00:02:31.340> I<00:02:31.640> think<00:02:31.819> the<00:02:32.120> torch<00:02:32.720> that<00:02:32.810> looks

00:02:32.949 --> 00:02:32.959 
and yeah I think the torch that looks

00:02:32.959 --> 00:02:35.949 
and yeah I think the torch that looks
pretty<00:02:33.080> good<00:02:33.730> and<00:02:34.730> of<00:02:35.299> course<00:02:35.480> he<00:02:35.629> just<00:02:35.810> has

00:02:35.949 --> 00:02:35.959 
pretty good and of course he just has

00:02:35.959 --> 00:02:39.309 
pretty good and of course he just has
some<00:02:36.260> red<00:02:36.799> lightsaber<00:02:37.280> blades<00:02:38.239> that<00:02:38.870> I<00:02:38.930> cut<00:02:39.230> in

00:02:39.309 --> 00:02:39.319 
some red lightsaber blades that I cut in

00:02:39.319 --> 00:02:42.009 
some red lightsaber blades that I cut in
half<00:02:39.470> and<00:02:39.650> made<00:02:39.830> the<00:02:39.950> smaller<00:02:40.540> so<00:02:41.540> here<00:02:41.930> are

00:02:42.009 --> 00:02:42.019 
half and made the smaller so here are

00:02:42.019 --> 00:02:43.600 
half and made the smaller so here are
the<00:02:42.080> legs<00:02:42.290> they<00:02:42.590> are<00:02:42.620> also<00:02:42.920> just<00:02:43.069> dark<00:02:43.430> red

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:43.610
