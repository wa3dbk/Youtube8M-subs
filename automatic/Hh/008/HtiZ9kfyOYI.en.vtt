00:03:08.829 --> 00:03:10.500 
all going to just come back to them it's
not<00:03:09.040> something<00:03:10.030> they're<00:03:10.090> going<00:03:10.209> to<00:03:10.299> have<00:03:10.420> to

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:10.510 
not something they're going to have to

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:12.330 
not something they're going to have to
struggle<00:03:10.750> with<00:03:10.900> their<00:03:11.200> work<00:03:11.350> over<00:03:11.650> the<00:03:11.739> hard

because the sport is new in their

00:03:17.139 --> 00:03:20.729 
because the sport is new in their
country<00:03:17.530> whereas<00:03:18.489> others<00:03:18.819> have<00:03:19.180> done<00:03:19.209> it<00:03:19.739> year

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:23.940 
and year out weekend and week out so
it's<00:03:22.630> going<00:03:22.750> to<00:03:22.810> be<00:03:23.049> like<00:03:23.319> putting<00:03:23.560> on<00:03:23.650> a<00:03:23.709> shirt

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:23.950 
it's going to be like putting on a shirt

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:26.759 
it's going to be like putting on a shirt
torn<00:03:24.190> and<00:03:24.810> that'll<00:03:25.810> tell<00:03:26.019> you<00:03:26.380> know<00:03:26.470> the

00:03:26.759 --> 00:03:26.769 
torn and that'll tell you know the

00:03:26.769 --> 00:03:29.729 
torn and that'll tell you know the
United<00:03:27.489> States<00:03:27.760> obviously<00:03:28.299> in<00:03:28.510> Canada<00:03:29.319> we're

00:03:29.729 --> 00:03:29.739 
United States obviously in Canada we're

00:03:29.739 --> 00:03:31.199 
United States obviously in Canada we're
pretty<00:03:29.920> close<00:03:30.130> to<00:03:30.190> our<00:03:30.430> sports<00:03:30.819> and<00:03:31.000> we<00:03:31.060> do<00:03:31.180> a

00:03:31.199 --> 00:03:31.209 
pretty close to our sports and we do a

00:03:31.209 --> 00:03:33.270 
pretty close to our sports and we do a
lot<00:03:31.420> so<00:03:32.019> for<00:03:32.260> the<00:03:32.350> other<00:03:32.470> teams<00:03:32.799> I<00:03:32.950> think<00:03:32.980> it's

00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:33.280 
lot so for the other teams I think it's

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:35.430 
lot so for the other teams I think it's
all<00:03:33.430> it's<00:03:33.609> a<00:03:33.670> little<00:03:33.880> bit<00:03:34.000> tougher<00:03:34.389> but<00:03:34.630> you

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:35.440

00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:36.970 
know you'll start to see it in all

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:40.080 
know you'll start to see it in all
sports<00:03:37.269> as<00:03:37.450> it<00:03:37.720> starts<00:03:37.989> to<00:03:38.049> catch<00:03:38.260> on<00:03:39.090> every

00:04:21.740 --> 00:04:21.750 
always tough I don't think the Lions are

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:23.390 
always tough I don't think the Lions are
still<00:04:21.959> in<00:04:22.079> a<00:04:22.169> rebuilding<00:04:22.440> stage<00:04:22.740> as<00:04:23.069> much<00:04:23.250> as

00:04:23.390 --> 00:04:23.400 
still in a rebuilding stage as much as

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:25.760 
still in a rebuilding stage as much as
they<00:04:23.520> are<00:04:23.639> in<00:04:23.759> the<00:04:23.849> structuring<00:04:24.330> and<00:04:24.770> really

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:25.770 
they are in the structuring and really

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:27.740 
they are in the structuring and really
teaching<00:04:26.250> their<00:04:26.370> young<00:04:26.550> players<00:04:26.849> how<00:04:27.509> to<00:04:27.569> get

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:27.750 
teaching their young players how to get

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:29.960 
teaching their young players how to get
the<00:04:27.870> job<00:04:28.050> done<00:04:28.110> I<00:04:28.560> look<00:04:29.310> for<00:04:29.460> the<00:04:29.490> Lions<00:04:29.849> to

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:29.970 
the job done I look for the Lions to

00:04:29.970 --> 00:04:31.820 
the job done I look for the Lions to
really<00:04:30.240> go<00:04:30.389> out<00:04:30.539> if<00:04:31.050> they're<00:04:31.259> supportive<00:04:31.740> of

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:31.830 
really go out if they're supportive of

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:33.200 
really go out if they're supportive of
their<00:04:31.949> coaches<00:04:32.159> nested<00:04:32.759> the<00:04:32.909> players

00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:33.210 
their coaches nested the players

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:35.420 
their coaches nested the players
speaking<00:04:33.810> on<00:04:34.050> behalf<00:04:34.530> of<00:04:34.740> the<00:04:34.830> players<00:04:35.069> and

00:04:35.420 --> 00:04:35.430 
speaking on behalf of the players and

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:37.219 
speaking on behalf of the players and
they're<00:04:36.060> supportive<00:04:36.479> of<00:04:36.599> the<00:04:36.690> coach<00:04:36.870> I<00:04:37.020> think

00:04:37.219 --> 00:04:37.229
