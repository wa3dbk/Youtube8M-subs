scrub<00:02:29.660> I<00:02:29.780> think<00:02:29.960> the<00:02:30.050> white<00:02:30.230> version<00:02:30.380> is<00:02:30.680> the

scrub I think the white version is the
one<00:02:30.920> that's<00:02:31.010> mirrored<00:02:31.490> so<00:02:32.440> let's<00:02:33.440> go<00:02:33.620> the<00:02:34.190> 5

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:34.520

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:43.910 
obviously pushing it further and I

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:46.690
