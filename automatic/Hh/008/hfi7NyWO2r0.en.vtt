00:03:58.280 --> 00:03:58.290 
measured it by with my feet and it was

00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:00.649

with my feet so let's see how it is with

00:04:15.389 --> 00:04:22.390 
with my feet so let's see how it is with
this<00:04:17.239> which<00:04:18.239> side<00:04:18.449> is<00:04:18.630> it<00:04:18.660> this<00:04:19.470> side<00:04:19.709> alright

00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:22.400 

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:26.600 

alright<00:04:23.400> it<00:04:23.820> is<00:04:24.680> let's<00:04:25.680> move<00:04:25.860> this<00:04:26.039> to<00:04:26.340> site

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:26.610 
alright it is let's move this to site

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:32.180 
alright it is let's move this to site
they<00:04:27.030> get<00:04:27.210> a<00:04:27.240> full<00:04:27.510> view<00:04:27.750> it<00:04:28.560> is<00:04:30.919> hold<00:04:31.919> on<00:04:32.160> a

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:32.190 
they get a full view it is hold on a

00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:36.379 
they get a full view it is hold on a
moment<00:04:33.020> at<00:04:34.020> my<00:04:34.289> mall<00:04:34.650> there<00:04:35.520> was<00:04:35.729> replicas<00:04:36.360> of

00:04:36.379 --> 00:04:36.389 
moment at my mall there was replicas of

00:04:36.389 --> 00:04:37.939 
moment at my mall there was replicas of
this<00:04:36.630> but<00:04:36.870> I<00:04:36.900> couldn't<00:04:37.229> get<00:04:37.349> one<00:04:37.470> back<00:04:37.650> then

00:04:37.939 --> 00:04:37.949 
this but I couldn't get one back then

00:04:37.949 --> 00:04:42.100 
this but I couldn't get one back then
cuz<00:04:38.099> I<00:04:38.160> was<00:04:38.280> too<00:04:38.430> young<00:04:38.840> but<00:04:39.840> now<00:04:40.199> I'm<00:04:40.760> older

00:04:45.409 --> 00:04:45.419 
obviously so I'm going to try and buy

00:04:45.419 --> 00:04:49.129 
obviously so I'm going to try and buy
the<00:04:46.280> hylian<00:04:47.280> shield<00:04:47.419> editors<00:04:48.419> there<00:04:48.960> was<00:04:49.110> a

00:04:49.129 --> 00:04:49.139 
the hylian shield editors there was a

00:04:49.139 --> 00:04:51.770 
the hylian shield editors there was a
lot<00:04:49.470> more<00:04:49.530> replicas<00:04:50.190> there<00:04:50.400> but<00:04:51.150> I'm<00:04:51.570> going<00:04:51.720> to

00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:51.780 
lot more replicas there but I'm going to

00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:53.210 
lot more replicas there but I'm going to
keep<00:04:51.840> it<00:04:52.050> right<00:04:52.139> here<00:04:52.199> make<00:04:52.800> sure<00:04:52.830> it<00:04:53.070> stays

00:04:53.210 --> 00:04:53.220 
keep it right here make sure it stays

00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:57.710 
keep it right here make sure it stays
balanced<00:04:54.740> start<00:04:55.740> up<00:04:55.800> a<00:04:55.860> gel<00:04:56.070> right<00:04:56.099> there<00:04:56.720> and

balanced start up a gel right there and

00:04:57.720 --> 00:05:01.010 
balanced start up a gel right there and
there<00:04:58.650> were<00:04:58.860> more<00:04:59.430> replicas<00:04:59.970> of<00:05:00.000> movie<00:05:00.690> stuff

00:05:01.010 --> 00:05:01.020
