00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:44.030 

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:46.449 

so<00:03:44.630> here's<00:03:45.020> our<00:03:45.140> opener<00:03:45.440> but<00:03:45.890> mega<00:03:46.100> saloon

00:03:46.449 --> 00:03:46.459 
so here's our opener but mega saloon

00:03:46.459 --> 00:03:49.180 
so here's our opener but mega saloon
which<00:03:46.670> is<00:03:46.790> probably<00:03:47.000> this<00:03:47.690> is<00:03:47.750> a<00:03:47.870> I<00:03:48.260> hope<00:03:49.040> he's

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:49.190 
which is probably this is a I hope he's

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:51.490 
which is probably this is a I hope he's
quite<00:03:49.370> good<00:03:49.400> against<00:03:49.819> him<00:03:49.910> definitely<00:03:50.840> turned

00:03:51.490 --> 00:03:51.500 
quite good against him definitely turned

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:53.470 
quite good against him definitely turned
off<00:03:51.620> his<00:03:51.770> link<00:03:52.370> muffs<00:03:52.580> and<00:03:52.730> inbox<00:03:53.030> and<00:03:53.240> so<00:03:53.420> on

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:53.480 
off his link muffs and inbox and so on

00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:57.010 
off his link muffs and inbox and so on
so<00:03:53.660> that's<00:03:54.590> pretty<00:03:54.830> good<00:03:55.569> if<00:03:56.569> we<00:03:56.690> can<00:03:56.780> get<00:03:56.840> back

00:03:57.010 --> 00:03:57.020 
so that's pretty good if we can get back

00:03:57.020 --> 00:04:00.610 
so that's pretty good if we can get back
to<00:03:57.200> playback<00:03:58.060> either<00:03:59.060> way<00:03:59.150> experiment<00:03:59.840> 14<00:04:00.470> who

we<00:05:19.010> pull<00:05:19.130> out<00:05:19.190> the<00:05:19.310> Berserker<00:05:19.729> we<00:05:20.090> could<00:05:20.210> have

00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:20.330 
we pull out the Berserker we could have

00:05:20.330 --> 00:05:23.490 
we pull out the Berserker we could have
bolted<00:05:20.630> his<00:05:20.960> spell<00:05:21.350> scout<00:05:21.590> and<00:05:21.710> killed<00:05:21.890> it<00:05:22.010> off

00:05:23.490 --> 00:05:23.500 
bolted his spell scout and killed it off

00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:25.960 
bolted his spell scout and killed it off
but<00:05:24.500> I<00:05:24.800> think<00:05:25.280> we're<00:05:25.520> better<00:05:25.640> off<00:05:25.820> just

00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:25.970 
but I think we're better off just

00:05:25.970 --> 00:05:28.409 
but I think we're better off just
putting<00:05:26.870> all<00:05:27.020> creatures<00:05:27.350> onto<00:05:27.560> the<00:05:27.650> ball<00:05:27.770> here

00:05:28.409 --> 00:05:28.419 
putting all creatures onto the ball here

00:05:28.419 --> 00:05:31.690 
putting all creatures onto the ball here
he<00:05:29.419> uses<00:05:29.690> turns<00:05:29.930> play<00:05:30.169> an<00:05:30.260> overseer<00:05:30.650> and<00:05:30.919> that

00:05:31.690 --> 00:05:31.700 
he uses turns play an overseer and that

00:05:31.700 --> 00:05:34.020 
he uses turns play an overseer and that
appears<00:05:32.360> to<00:05:32.510> be<00:05:32.600> strongly<00:05:32.840> on<00:05:33.020> lands<00:05:33.440> here

00:05:34.020 --> 00:05:34.030 
appears to be strongly on lands here

which is ideal here we can get rid of
his<00:05:40.310> palace<00:05:40.610> kite<00:05:40.789> an<00:05:40.910> attack<00:05:42.190> so<00:05:43.190> we're<00:05:43.280> going

to get rid the spells guy actually

00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:46.390 
to get rid the spells guy actually
boldly<00:05:45.110> oversee<00:05:45.710> here<00:05:45.919> you<00:05:46.190> probably

00:05:46.390 --> 00:05:46.400 
boldly oversee here you probably

00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:48.640 
boldly oversee here you probably
wouldn't<00:05:46.640> that<00:05:46.789> just<00:05:46.820> to<00:05:47.090> attack<00:05:47.360> and<00:05:47.690> see<00:05:48.410> if

00:05:48.640 --> 00:05:48.650 
wouldn't that just to attack and see if

00:05:48.650 --> 00:05:50.440 
wouldn't that just to attack and see if
he<00:05:48.770> was<00:05:48.919> willing<00:05:49.220> to<00:05:49.370> block<00:05:49.610> if<00:05:49.880> you<00:05:50.000> take<00:05:50.270> no

00:05:50.440 --> 00:05:50.450 
he was willing to block if you take no

00:05:50.450 --> 00:05:53.610 
he was willing to block if you take no
blocks<00:05:50.690> then<00:05:50.930> he<00:05:51.020> just<00:05:51.169> dies

00:05:53.610 --> 00:05:53.620 

00:05:53.620 --> 00:05:58.129 

I<00:05:53.680> try<00:05:54.310> even<00:05:54.490> if<00:05:54.580> you<00:05:54.729> three<00:05:55.240> six<00:05:56.080> seven<00:05:56.410> eight

00:05:58.129 --> 00:05:58.139 
I try even if you three six seven eight

00:05:58.139 --> 00:06:01.560 
I try even if you three six seven eight
yeah<00:05:59.669> yeah<00:06:00.669> if<00:06:00.820> the<00:06:00.940> only<00:06:01.060> box<00:06:01.240> with<00:06:01.389> a<00:06:01.419> mem

00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:01.570 
yeah yeah if the only box with a mem

00:06:01.570 --> 00:06:06.870 
yeah yeah if the only box with a mem
night<00:06:02.520> that's<00:06:04.199> probably<00:06:05.199> fine<00:06:05.410> to<00:06:05.650> you<00:06:06.639> very

00:06:06.870 --> 00:06:06.880 
night that's probably fine to you very

00:06:06.880 --> 00:06:09.870 
night that's probably fine to you very
close<00:06:07.090> to<00:06:07.270> dead<00:06:07.419> tipping<00:06:07.750> come<00:06:07.960> fall<00:06:08.880> you

00:06:09.870 --> 00:06:09.880 
close to dead tipping come fall you

00:06:09.880 --> 00:06:11.070 
close to dead tipping come fall you
might<00:06:10.030> have<00:06:10.090> killed<00:06:10.270> beyond<00:06:10.479> Syria<00:06:10.840> the<00:06:10.960> way

00:06:11.070 --> 00:06:11.080 
might have killed beyond Syria the way

00:06:11.080 --> 00:06:13.290 
might have killed beyond Syria the way
but<00:06:11.139> I<00:06:11.650> think<00:06:12.430> we'd<00:06:12.550> better<00:06:12.760> just<00:06:12.910> to<00:06:13.060> attack

00:06:13.290 --> 00:06:13.300 
but I think we'd better just to attack

00:06:13.300 --> 00:06:14.730 
but I think we'd better just to attack
and<00:06:13.479> see<00:06:13.600> if<00:06:13.690> he<00:06:13.750> blocks<00:06:13.930> because<00:06:14.260> we<00:06:14.560> don't

00:06:14.730 --> 00:06:14.740 
and see if he blocks because we don't

00:06:14.740 --> 00:06:16.230 
and see if he blocks because we don't
really<00:06:15.190> mind<00:06:15.430> if<00:06:15.610> you<00:06:15.699> blocks<00:06:15.880> with<00:06:16.000> either<00:06:16.090> of

00:06:16.230 --> 00:06:16.240 
really mind if you blocks with either of

00:06:16.240 --> 00:06:19.909 
really mind if you blocks with either of
these<00:06:16.389> guys<00:06:17.669> particularly<00:06:18.669> not<00:06:18.880> the<00:06:18.970> overseer

00:06:19.909 --> 00:06:19.919 
these guys particularly not the overseer

00:06:19.919 --> 00:06:22.140 
these guys particularly not the overseer
but<00:06:20.919> as<00:06:21.070> it<00:06:21.190> stands<00:06:21.370> he<00:06:21.639> to<00:06:21.699> the<00:06:21.820> block<00:06:21.970> and<00:06:22.060> he

00:06:22.140 --> 00:06:22.150 
but as it stands he to the block and he

00:06:22.150 --> 00:06:25.080 
but as it stands he to the block and he
goes<00:06:22.270> down<00:06:22.389> to<00:06:22.540> one<00:06:22.720> and<00:06:23.910> we<00:06:24.910> get<00:06:25.030> the

00:06:25.080 --> 00:06:25.090 
goes down to one and we get the

00:06:25.090 --> 00:06:27.680 
goes down to one and we get the
concession<00:06:25.510> there<00:06:25.630> so<00:06:26.050> that's<00:06:26.139> fine<00:06:26.410> further

00:06:27.680 --> 00:06:27.690 
concession there so that's fine further

00:06:27.690 --> 00:06:30.000 
concession there so that's fine further
yeah<00:06:28.690> I<00:06:28.720> think<00:06:28.870> we<00:06:29.080> should<00:06:29.110> really<00:06:29.650> be<00:06:29.770> able<00:06:29.860> to

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:30.010 
yeah I think we should really be able to

00:06:30.010 --> 00:06:32.790 
yeah I think we should really be able to
keep<00:06:30.130> the<00:06:30.250> bolt<00:06:30.460> as<00:06:30.870> if<00:06:31.870> you<00:06:31.990> just<00:06:32.199> didn't<00:06:32.470> make

00:06:32.790 --> 00:06:32.800 
keep the bolt as if you just didn't make

00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:34.920 
keep the bolt as if you just didn't make
no<00:06:32.860> blocks<00:06:33.220> we<00:06:33.400> can<00:06:33.520> involve<00:06:33.699> him<00:06:33.910> and<00:06:34.060> one<00:06:34.240> lat

00:06:34.920 --> 00:06:34.930 
no blocks we can involve him and one lat

00:06:34.930 --> 00:06:37.710 
no blocks we can involve him and one lat
CERN<00:06:35.169> and<00:06:36.000> had<00:06:37.000> he<00:06:37.090> blocked<00:06:37.300> with<00:06:37.449> just<00:06:37.630> the

00:06:37.710 --> 00:06:37.720 
CERN and had he blocked with just the

00:06:37.720 --> 00:06:39.540 
CERN and had he blocked with just the
mem<00:06:37.870> night<00:06:38.050> it<00:06:38.800> would<00:06:38.919> still<00:06:39.039> been<00:06:39.250> in<00:06:39.310> pretty

00:06:39.540 --> 00:06:39.550 
mem night it would still been in pretty

00:06:39.550 --> 00:06:41.580 
mem night it would still been in pretty
good<00:06:39.580> position<00:06:40.050> then<00:06:41.050> maybe<00:06:41.199> with<00:06:41.410> the<00:06:41.470> boat

00:06:41.580 --> 00:06:41.590 
good position then maybe with the boat

00:06:41.590 --> 00:06:42.779 
good position then maybe with the boat
with<00:06:41.680> the<00:06:41.770> overseer<00:06:42.100> so<00:06:42.400> it<00:06:42.490> would<00:06:42.610> be<00:06:42.729> in

00:06:42.779 --> 00:06:42.789 
with the overseer so it would be in

00:06:42.789 --> 00:06:45.629 
with the overseer so it would be in

affinity which is quite good don't think
it<00:06:50.889> will<00:06:50.949> always<00:06:51.220> go<00:06:51.340> this<00:06:51.520> way<00:06:51.669> in<00:06:52.300> bulk

00:06:52.560 --> 00:06:52.570

definitely a problem for our deck is a
life<00:06:57.970> gain<00:06:58.210> is<00:06:58.389> something<00:06:58.720> that<00:06:58.780> we<00:06:58.870> don't

00:06:58.980 --> 00:06:58.990 
life gain is something that we don't

really want to see and flies are quite
difficult<00:07:01.240> handle<00:07:01.750> but<00:07:02.650> uh<00:07:02.710> otherwise<00:07:04.200> that

00:07:05.190 --> 00:07:05.200 
difficult handle but uh otherwise that

went<00:07:05.380> quite<00:07:05.530> well<00:07:05.680> and<00:07:05.979> I<00:07:06.430> think<00:07:06.550> if<00:07:06.760> you<00:07:06.849> can

00:07:06.990 --> 00:07:07.000 
went quite well and I think if you can

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:09.330 
went quite well and I think if you can
flip<00:07:07.150> the<00:07:07.270> board<00:07:07.419> which<00:07:07.630> big<00:07:07.990> guys<00:07:08.220> they<00:07:09.220> will

00:07:09.330 --> 00:07:09.340 
flip the board which big guys they will

00:07:09.340 --> 00:07:12.150 
flip the board which big guys they will
struggle<00:07:09.669> if<00:07:10.479> I<00:07:10.690> can't<00:07:11.110> find<00:07:11.229> that<00:07:11.380> key<00:07:11.650> key

00:07:12.150 --> 00:07:12.160
