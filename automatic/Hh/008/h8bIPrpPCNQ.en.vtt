00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
it is metal it is aluminum to be some

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:01.189 
it is metal it is aluminum to be some
more<00:00:58.620> specific<00:00:59.070> and<00:00:59.690> the<00:01:00.690> one<00:01:00.809> that<00:01:00.960> I<00:01:00.989> had

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199 
more specific and the one that I had

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:03.319
