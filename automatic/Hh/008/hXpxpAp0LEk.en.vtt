00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:31.180 
us forward nobody else believed we had a
chance<00:02:30.200> obviously<00:02:30.739> we've<00:02:30.860> got<00:02:30.980> a<00:02:31.010> lot<00:02:31.160> of

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:31.190 
chance obviously we've got a lot of

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:33.040 
chance obviously we've got a lot of
press<00:02:31.520> to<00:02:31.790> say<00:02:31.970> that<00:02:32.239> we<00:02:32.360> never<00:02:32.569> win<00:02:32.780> anything

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:33.050 
press to say that we never win anything

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:34.960 
press to say that we never win anything
where<00:02:33.560> we<00:02:33.770> haven't<00:02:34.040> won<00:02:34.160> anything<00:02:34.370> in<00:02:34.550> 60

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:36.980 
years and we ignored all of that we

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:38.620 
years and we ignored all of that we
believe<00:02:37.280> that<00:02:37.310> on<00:02:37.670> the<00:02:37.790> day<00:02:37.970> we<00:02:38.300> could<00:02:38.420> produce

believe that on the day we could produce

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:41.170 
believe that on the day we could produce
the<00:02:38.900> horses<00:02:39.260> for<00:02:39.440> the<00:02:39.530> right<00:02:39.739> time<00:02:40.060> we<00:02:41.060> had<00:02:41.150> a

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:41.180 
the horses for the right time we had a

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:43.420 
the horses for the right time we had a
great<00:02:41.660> program<00:02:42.140> leading<00:02:42.560> up<00:02:42.830> to<00:02:43.010> it<00:02:43.130> or<00:02:43.250> the

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:43.430 
great program leading up to it or the

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:46.120 
great program leading up to it or the
riders<00:02:43.850> worked<00:02:44.090> really<00:02:44.600> hard<00:02:44.720> together<00:02:45.110> and<00:02:45.650> I

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:46.130 
riders worked really hard together and I

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:47.800 
riders worked really hard together and I
don't<00:02:46.610> think<00:02:46.820> I'll<00:02:46.940> ever<00:02:47.060> experienced

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:47.810
