is split bengal gram and i will be using

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:47.990 
is split bengal gram and i will be using
around<00:00:45.989> a<00:00:46.140> tablespoon<00:00:46.649> or<00:00:46.680> so<00:00:46.800> salt<00:00:47.789> to<00:00:47.910> taste

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
let's see how to make this the first

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:02.479 
let's see how to make this the first
step<00:01:00.600> what<00:01:00.960> what<00:01:01.410> is<00:01:01.559> the<00:01:01.679> first<00:01:01.890> step<00:01:02.010> okay

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
step what what is the first step okay

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:03.860 
step what what is the first step okay
now<00:01:02.640> the<00:01:02.730> first<00:01:02.969> step<00:01:03.090> is<00:01:03.359> that<00:01:03.510> I<00:01:03.539> will<00:01:03.780> be

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
now the first step is that I will be

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:06.520 
now the first step is that I will be
taking<00:01:03.960> this<00:01:04.260> coconut<00:01:04.559> I<00:01:04.980> will<00:01:05.640> be<00:01:05.790> adding

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
this what you can alternatively do is

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:17.510 
this what you can alternatively do is
you<00:01:15.299> can<00:01:15.509> solve<00:01:15.900> this<00:01:16.080> in<00:01:16.290> water<00:01:16.560> you<00:01:17.220> know<00:01:17.340> for

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520 
you can solve this in water you know for

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:19.460 
you can solve this in water you know for
around<00:01:17.820> 5<00:01:18.180> to<00:01:18.210> 10<00:01:18.509> minutes<00:01:18.659> and<00:01:18.990> then<00:01:19.259> add
