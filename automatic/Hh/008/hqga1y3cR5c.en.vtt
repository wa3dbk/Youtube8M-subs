00:00:09.670 --> 00:00:12.850
 the iron ponies of the atlantean and the 

00:00:11.530 --> 00:00:14.530
 Tigers of the Autonomous University of 

00:00:12.850 --> 00:00:15.760
 new lion continue to work with 

00:00:14.530 --> 00:00:17.770
 intensity in their respective 

00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:18.970
 preseason so they held a 

00:00:17.770 --> 00:00:20.500
 Friendly duel at the Andre Stadium 

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:22.480
 quintana roo where the painting 

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:25.570
 regiomontano took the victory for 1 

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:27.160
 0 with goals from André-Pierre Gignac this 

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:28.390
 it was the third preparation duel 

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:30.490
 azulgrana team that directs eduardo 

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:32.650
 fentanes while the northern team 

00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:34.000
 that brings a real blunderbuss already works 

00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:35.980
 forced marches to face the 

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.230
 next July 15 the first pain to 

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:39.910
 without end of the liberators cup at 

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:41.320
 end the match the reactions 

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:42.970
 they were positive for both templates 

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:45.250
 it's the first game we have 

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:46.629
 obviously we are feeling a bit the 

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:47.830
 physical work that we did during two 

00:00:46.629 --> 00:00:49.870
 weeks but I think the important thing 

00:00:47.830 --> 00:00:51.100
 is that of all the reinforcements all the 

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:52.960
 People who are coming are starting to 

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:54.640
 attach to the idea of ​​the teacher never 

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:57.370
 then these parties serve for that 

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:59.440
 to tell us assimilating to the scheme the 

00:00:57.370 --> 00:01:02.680
 tactic that wants to impregnate the teacher of 

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:05.470
 we have been one the two days 

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:08.640
 very positive weeks we are trained 

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:10.920
 really very good in every aspect and 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:13.260
 and good as the 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:15.630
 competition date we are 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:18.090
 feeling better the truth has been very 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:20.010
 good this work that we've been 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:22.830
 doing and we're hardly 

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:25.530
 loosening the equipment is finding a 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:28.560
 rhythm a mystical and the truth is that it has 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:31.259
 been very good in general in the balance 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:32.520
 that we can now take out the president of 

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:34.979
 tigers the engineer alejandro rodríguez 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:36.810
 He did not let the moment pass to talk about 

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:38.970
 polished subject and its possible future in the 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:41.220
 Mexican football was getting that 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:44.220
 are you define the situation and once 

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:45.509
 defined that we are 100% sure that it is going 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:47.250
 to be in our favor 

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:49.619
 then polished as he does not want to return 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:51.479
 You are good because you have the option to go 

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:53.429
 with chivas that already have with us a 

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:55.740
 I agree to an arrangement but now that I want 

00:01:53.429 --> 00:01:58.200
 polished sign your employment contract or that 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:02:00.750
 there is a serious formal team that 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:03.000
 really respect the rules and that you 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:04.440
 close by us for to see 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.390
 the possibility is that polishing 

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:08.310
 play with some other team that does not 

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:10.140
 I know if it's this way it's like both 

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:12.780
 teams continue working prior to 

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:14.040
 start of the 2015 opening recalls 

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:15.510
