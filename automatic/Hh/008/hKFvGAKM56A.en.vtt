00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:06.659 
play another EA game but I'm sure that

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:08.359 
play another EA game but I'm sure that
you<00:02:06.990> will<00:02:07.200> I'm<00:02:07.530> sure<00:02:07.619> they<00:02:07.979> wouldn't<00:02:08.160> do<00:02:08.340> that

00:02:08.359 --> 00:02:08.369 
you will I'm sure they wouldn't do that

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:11.029 
you will I'm sure they wouldn't do that
to<00:02:08.700> you<00:02:08.789> guys<00:02:09.050> but<00:02:10.050> yes<00:02:10.289> since<00:02:10.649> the<00:02:10.830> game<00:02:10.979> has

00:02:11.029 --> 00:02:11.039 
to you guys but yes since the game has

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:14.030 
to you guys but yes since the game has
been<00:02:11.640> dropped<00:02:12.030> I'm<00:02:12.660> really<00:02:13.020> hoping<00:02:13.410> that

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:14.040 
been dropped I'm really hoping that

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:16.759 
been dropped I'm really hoping that
they<00:02:14.969> will<00:02:15.150> provide<00:02:15.510> another<00:02:16.049> way<00:02:16.469> of

00:02:16.759 --> 00:02:16.769 
they will provide another way of

00:02:16.769 --> 00:02:20.869 
they will provide another way of
accessing<00:02:17.459> that<00:02:17.790> beta<00:02:18.890> besides<00:02:19.890> providing<00:02:20.609> a

00:02:20.869 --> 00:02:20.879 
accessing that beta besides providing a

00:02:20.879 --> 00:02:23.179 
accessing that beta besides providing a
game<00:02:21.120> that<00:02:21.420> most<00:02:22.079> people<00:02:22.530> probably<00:02:22.829> don't

00:02:23.179 --> 00:02:23.189 
game that most people probably don't

00:02:23.189 --> 00:02:26.449 
game that most people probably don't
