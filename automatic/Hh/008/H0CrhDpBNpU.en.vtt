second greenhouse wind tunnel
call<00:00:10.469> it<00:00:10.590> a<00:00:10.620> wind<00:00:10.800> towel<00:00:10.950> because<00:00:11.099> didn't<00:00:11.400> have

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:11.490

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:30.900 
bender Colvin has worked pretty easy

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:32.950 
bender Colvin has worked pretty easy
they're<00:01:31.140> very<00:01:31.320> simple<00:01:31.560> designs

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:32.960 
they're very simple designs

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:36.490 
they're very simple designs
this<00:01:33.960> one's<00:01:34.229> bolted<00:01:34.710> down<00:01:34.920> to<00:01:35.280> our<00:01:35.400> table<00:01:35.820> here

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:36.500 
this one's bolted down to our table here

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:42.170 
this one's bolted down to our table here
and<00:01:40.159> that's<00:01:41.159> our<00:01:41.280> bender<00:01:41.610> bar<00:01:41.790> when<00:01:41.939> we<00:01:42.030> get

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180 
and that's our bender bar when we get

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:44.660 
and that's our bender bar when we get
close<00:01:42.390> to<00:01:42.420> the<00:01:42.659> end<00:01:42.780> of<00:01:42.840> the<00:01:42.930> pipe<00:01:43.520> and<00:01:44.520> what

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670 
close to the end of the pipe and what

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:46.760 
close to the end of the pipe and what
you<00:01:44.759> see<00:01:44.939> here<00:01:44.970> is<00:01:45.270> a<00:01:45.299> bunch<00:01:45.540> of<00:01:45.630> 1<00:01:45.810> by<00:01:45.960> 2's<00:01:46.259> that

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770 
you see here is a bunch of 1 by 2's that

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:48.679 
you see here is a bunch of 1 by 2's that
we've<00:01:46.890> screwed<00:01:47.189> down<00:01:47.369> to<00:01:47.490> the<00:01:47.579> table<00:01:47.790> that's

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:48.689 
we've screwed down to the table that's

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:52.460 
we've screwed down to the table that's

so invent use your pole bender your

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:54.440 
so invent use your pole bender your
poles<00:01:52.920> will<00:01:53.250> rest<00:01:53.490> on<00:01:53.700> that<00:01:53.729> as<00:01:54.000> it's<00:01:54.180> going

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:54.450 
poles will rest on that as it's going

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:56.719 
poles will rest on that as it's going
out<00:01:54.570> being<00:01:54.899> bent<00:01:55.170> otherwise<00:01:55.950> if<00:01:56.310> you<00:01:56.430> don't<00:01:56.549> do

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:56.729 
out being bent otherwise if you don't do

00:01:56.729 --> 00:01:59.959 
out being bent otherwise if you don't do
that<00:01:56.939> it'll<00:01:57.259> bend<00:01:58.259> down<00:01:58.560> and<00:01:58.890> kind<00:01:59.250> of<00:01:59.369> curve

00:01:59.959 --> 00:01:59.969 
that it'll bend down and kind of curve

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:01.700 
that it'll bend down and kind of curve
while<00:02:00.540> you're<00:02:00.689> bending<00:02:00.899> it<00:02:01.140> and<00:02:01.200> you<00:02:01.530> don't

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:01.710 
while you're bending it and you don't

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:02.800 
while you're bending it and you don't
want<00:02:01.829> to<00:02:01.860> do<00:02:02.009> that

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:02.810 
want to do that

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:06.880 
want to do that
here<00:02:03.590> we've<00:02:03.799> bent<00:02:04.070> ten<00:02:04.759> of<00:02:04.880> them<00:02:05.030> already<00:02:05.890> and

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:06.890 
here we've bent ten of them already and

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:10.600 
here we've bent ten of them already and
then<00:02:07.280> we've<00:02:07.399> got<00:02:08.200> 20<00:02:09.200> more<00:02:09.319> to<00:02:09.440> go<00:02:09.470> and<00:02:09.830> that's

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:10.610 
then we've got 20 more to go and that's

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:14.050 
then we've got 20 more to go and that's
what<00:02:10.729> I'm<00:02:10.880> going<00:02:10.970> to<00:02:11.060> be<00:02:11.120> doing<00:02:11.270> next<00:02:12.940> after<00:02:13.940> we

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:14.060 
what I'm going to be doing next after we

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:15.400 
what I'm going to be doing next after we
get<00:02:14.180> them<00:02:14.330> bent<00:02:14.569> what<00:02:14.780> we'll<00:02:14.930> do<00:02:15.080> is<00:02:15.260> we'll

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:15.410 
get them bent what we'll do is we'll

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:18.820 
get them bent what we'll do is we'll
screw<00:02:15.800> we'll<00:02:16.790> find<00:02:17.000> a<00:02:17.060> flat<00:02:17.239> surface<00:02:17.510> and<00:02:17.900> when

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:18.830 
screw we'll find a flat surface and when
