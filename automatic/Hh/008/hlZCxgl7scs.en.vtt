00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:00.439 
things
I<00:00:57.320> took<00:00:58.320> if<00:00:58.710> you<00:00:58.829> look<00:00:59.010> inside<00:00:59.219> of<00:00:59.460> it<00:00:59.760> there's

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:00.449 
I took if you look inside of it there's

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:03.560 
I took if you look inside of it there's
a<00:01:00.570> little<00:01:00.840> metal<00:01:01.440> piece<00:01:01.890> there<00:01:02.280> and<00:01:02.570> there's

a little metal piece there and there's

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:05.750 
a little metal piece there and there's
actually<00:01:04.049> a<00:01:04.080> hole<00:01:04.350> there<00:01:04.739> on<00:01:04.890> the<00:01:05.040> side<00:01:05.309> which

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760 
actually a hole there on the side which

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:07.429 
actually a hole there on the side which
I<00:01:05.939> assumed<00:01:06.210> would<00:01:06.479> allow<00:01:06.750> you<00:01:06.810> to<00:01:06.990> be<00:01:07.200> able<00:01:07.290> to

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:07.439 
I assumed would allow you to be able to

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:11.870 
I assumed would allow you to be able to
screw<00:01:07.950> out<00:01:08.159> that<00:01:08.580> piece<00:01:09.979> so<00:01:10.979> I<00:01:11.010> took<00:01:11.340> I<00:01:11.700> was

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
screw out that piece so I took I was

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:14.630 
screw out that piece so I took I was
able<00:01:12.000> to<00:01:12.180> after<00:01:12.720> a<00:01:12.900> little<00:01:13.170> bit<00:01:13.290> of<00:01:13.380> work<00:01:14.189> get

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
able to after a little bit of work get

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:17.330 
able to after a little bit of work get
it<00:01:14.729> to<00:01:14.880> turn<00:01:15.030> a<00:01:15.090> little<00:01:15.330> bit<00:01:15.860> and<00:01:16.860> it<00:01:17.009> seemed<00:01:17.250> to

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
it to turn a little bit and it seemed to

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:19.249 
it to turn a little bit and it seemed to
pull<00:01:17.549> down<00:01:17.759> and<00:01:18.180> I<00:01:18.299> actually<00:01:18.450> could<00:01:18.810> get<00:01:18.990> it<00:01:19.140> to

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259 
pull down and I actually could get it to

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:24.289 
pull down and I actually could get it to
work<00:01:19.439> a<00:01:19.770> little<00:01:19.979> bit<00:01:20.250> then<00:01:20.720> I<00:01:22.880> this<00:01:23.880> was<00:01:24.090> about

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:24.299 
work a little bit then I this was about

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:26.030 
work a little bit then I this was about

Roman RCA for about almost nine months
ago<00:01:30.079> since<00:01:31.079> then<00:01:31.409> I<00:01:31.710> realized<00:01:32.310> that<00:01:32.579> this

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820 
ago since then I realized that this

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:37.819 
ago since then I realized that this
whole<00:01:33.030> thing<00:01:33.329> pulls<00:01:33.659> right<00:01:33.930> out<00:01:34.040> in<00:01:35.040> fact<00:01:36.829> you

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:37.829 
whole thing pulls right out in fact you

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:39.380 
whole thing pulls right out in fact you
can't<00:01:38.070> get<00:01:38.220> the<00:01:38.369> come<00:01:38.490> out<00:01:38.610> now<00:01:38.850> because<00:01:39.270> I

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.390 
can't get the come out now because I

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:43.010 
can't get the come out now because I
believe<00:01:39.659> but<00:01:39.869> I<00:01:39.900> there<00:01:40.530> we<00:01:40.650> go<00:01:40.820> okay<00:01:41.820> this<00:01:42.750> will

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
believe but I there we go okay this will

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:44.810 
believe but I there we go okay this will
pull<00:01:43.229> out<00:01:43.409> right<00:01:43.799> here<00:01:44.100> and<00:01:44.280> it's<00:01:44.430> actually

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:44.820 
pull out right here and it's actually

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:47.630 
pull out right here and it's actually
kind<00:01:45.030> of<00:01:45.090> a<00:01:45.180> crappy<00:01:45.659> little<00:01:45.780> LED<00:01:46.470> that's<00:01:47.399> on

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 
kind of a crappy little LED that's on

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:49.910 
kind of a crappy little LED that's on
these<00:01:47.850> I<00:01:47.909> I<00:01:48.659> kind<00:01:49.200> of<00:01:49.320> thought<00:01:49.500> that<00:01:49.560> it<00:01:49.770> was

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920 
these I I kind of thought that it was

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:51.289 
these I I kind of thought that it was
something<00:01:50.159> that's<00:01:50.490> supposed<00:01:50.790> to<00:01:50.880> be<00:01:50.939> a<00:01:51.030> little

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:51.299 
something that's supposed to be a little

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:55.039 
something that's supposed to be a little
better<00:01:51.509> but<00:01:52.100> I'll<00:01:53.100> set<00:01:53.310> this<00:01:53.460> down<00:01:53.670> here<00:01:54.119> if

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:55.049 
better but I'll set this down here if

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:57.319 
better but I'll set this down here if
you<00:01:55.229> can<00:01:55.409> see<00:01:55.649> here<00:01:56.040> I<00:01:56.250> actually<00:01:56.759> had<00:01:57.060> to<00:01:57.180> glue

00:01:57.319 --> 00:01:57.329 
you can see here I actually had to glue

00:01:57.329 --> 00:02:00.200 
you can see here I actually had to glue
mine<00:01:57.630> back<00:01:57.869> on<00:01:58.170> all<00:01:58.439> I<00:01:58.500> had<00:01:59.009> done<00:01:59.310> was<00:01:59.729> broken

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:00.210 
mine back on all I had done was broken

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:02.929 
mine back on all I had done was broken
that<00:02:00.390> loose<00:02:00.750> so<00:02:01.590> it<00:02:01.920> allowed<00:02:02.189> it<00:02:02.369> to<00:02:02.399> pull<00:02:02.670> down

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:02.939 
that loose so it allowed it to pull down

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:05.179 
that loose so it allowed it to pull down
so<00:02:03.299> I<00:02:03.540> was<00:02:03.780> getting<00:02:03.990> at<00:02:04.229> least<00:02:04.259> piratical<00:02:05.040> II

00:02:05.179 --> 00:02:05.189 
so I was getting at least piratical II

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:07.069 
so I was getting at least piratical II
it<00:02:05.490> would<00:02:05.640> turn<00:02:05.880> on<00:02:06.060> at<00:02:06.240> that<00:02:06.420> point<00:02:06.719> now<00:02:06.960> if

00:02:07.069 --> 00:02:07.079 
it would turn on at that point now if

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:10.580 
it would turn on at that point now if
you<00:02:07.200> look<00:02:07.439> here<00:02:08.330> if<00:02:09.330> I<00:02:09.599> push<00:02:09.840> that<00:02:09.869> down<00:02:10.289> like

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:10.590 
you look here if I push that down like

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:12.510 
you look here if I push that down like
that<00:02:10.830> it<00:02:11.099> works<00:02:11.340> just<00:02:11.640> fine

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:12.520 
that it works just fine

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:15.300 
that it works just fine
so<00:02:12.880> I<00:02:13.210> realized<00:02:13.720> what<00:02:13.930> was<00:02:13.960> happening<00:02:14.080> was<00:02:14.710> the

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:15.310 
so I realized what was happening was the

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:18.870 
so I realized what was happening was the
spacing<00:02:15.910> was<00:02:16.870> incorrect<00:02:17.470> here<00:02:17.980> and<00:02:18.550> I'm<00:02:18.670> no

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:18.880 
spacing was incorrect here and I'm no

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:20.970 
spacing was incorrect here and I'm no
expert<00:02:19.030> with<00:02:19.450> flashlights<00:02:19.960> I<00:02:20.110> have<00:02:20.260> a<00:02:20.290> lot<00:02:20.650> you

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:20.980 
expert with flashlights I have a lot you

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:23.730 
expert with flashlights I have a lot you
know<00:02:21.280> or<00:02:21.520> a<00:02:21.580> good<00:02:21.850> collection<00:02:22.210> I<00:02:22.660> probably<00:02:23.440> can

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:23.740 
know or a good collection I probably can

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:26.640 
know or a good collection I probably can
good<00:02:24.040> flashlights<00:02:24.870> good<00:02:25.870> brands<00:02:26.290> and<00:02:26.440> stuff

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:26.650 
good flashlights good brands and stuff

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:29.610 
good flashlights good brands and stuff
but<00:02:27.640> basically<00:02:28.240> with<00:02:28.510> this<00:02:28.660> sitting<00:02:29.080> here<00:02:29.440> and

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:29.620 
but basically with this sitting here and

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:33.780 
but basically with this sitting here and
you<00:02:30.610> threaded<00:02:31.030> this<00:02:31.210> in<00:02:31.480> this<00:02:32.460> here<00:02:33.460> on<00:02:33.670> the

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:33.790 
you threaded this in this here on the

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:35.510 
you threaded this in this here on the
tube<00:02:34.060> was<00:02:34.390> not<00:02:34.570> actually<00:02:34.990> making<00:02:35.260> contact

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:35.520 
tube was not actually making contact

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:42.300 
tube was not actually making contact
here<00:02:37.770> so<00:02:39.270> what<00:02:40.270> I<00:02:40.300> did<00:02:40.930> to<00:02:41.230> solve<00:02:41.650> the<00:02:41.860> problem

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:42.310 
here so what I did to solve the problem

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:46.560 
here so what I did to solve the problem
and<00:02:42.460> it<00:02:43.450> actually<00:02:43.630> does<00:02:44.050> is<00:02:45.090> first<00:02:46.090> I<00:02:46.330> took<00:02:46.540> a

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:46.570 
and it actually does is first I took a

00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:48.930 
and it actually does is first I took a
little<00:02:46.720> piece<00:02:46.930> of<00:02:46.960> wire<00:02:47.290> and<00:02:47.590> bend<00:02:48.520> it<00:02:48.610> into<00:02:48.910> a

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:48.940 
little piece of wire and bend it into a

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:50.850 
little piece of wire and bend it into a
circle<00:02:49.420> that<00:02:49.540> would<00:02:49.660> fit<00:02:49.900> pretty<00:02:50.080> well<00:02:50.230> that

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:50.860 
circle that would fit pretty well that

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:52.770 
circle that would fit pretty well that
actually<00:02:51.160> worked<00:02:51.610> the<00:02:51.700> best<00:02:51.940> but<00:02:52.270> I<00:02:52.330> lost<00:02:52.570> my

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:52.780 
actually worked the best but I lost my

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:54.780 
actually worked the best but I lost my
little<00:02:53.080> wire<00:02:53.290> before<00:02:54.160> I<00:02:54.190> want<00:02:54.430> to<00:02:54.460> make<00:02:54.640> the

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:54.790 
little wire before I want to make the

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:57.540 
little wire before I want to make the
video<00:02:54.910> so<00:02:55.900> I<00:02:56.170> just<00:02:56.470> took<00:02:56.650> a<00:02:56.710> little<00:02:57.010> split<00:02:57.310> ring

00:02:57.540 --> 00:02:57.550 
video so I just took a little split ring

00:02:57.550 --> 00:03:00.600 
video so I just took a little split ring
and<00:02:57.910> put<00:02:58.090> it<00:02:58.180> on<00:02:58.300> and<00:02:58.570> as<00:02:58.780> you<00:02:58.960> can<00:02:59.080> see<00:02:59.610> works

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:00.610 
and put it on and as you can see works

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:03.570 
and put it on and as you can see works
just<00:03:01.270> fine<00:03:01.510> now<00:03:01.780> turns<00:03:02.560> on<00:03:02.800> and<00:03:03.160> off<00:03:03.220> the<00:03:03.460> only

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:03.580 
just fine now turns on and off the only

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:05.640 
just fine now turns on and off the only
thing<00:03:03.850> with<00:03:03.970> the<00:03:04.060> split<00:03:04.360> ring<00:03:04.390> is<00:03:05.140> being<00:03:05.500> a

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:05.650 
thing with the split ring is being a

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:08.670 
thing with the split ring is being a
little<00:03:05.920> bit<00:03:06.100> wider<00:03:06.400> or<00:03:07.390> thicker<00:03:07.780> it<00:03:08.170> actually

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:08.680 
little bit wider or thicker it actually

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:11.100 
little bit wider or thicker it actually
made<00:03:08.860> it<00:03:08.890> so<00:03:09.190> it<00:03:09.310> doesn't<00:03:09.550> engage<00:03:09.850> all<00:03:10.570> the<00:03:10.630> way

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:11.110 
made it so it doesn't engage all the way

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:13.680 
made it so it doesn't engage all the way
close<00:03:11.890> it<00:03:12.310> actually<00:03:12.730> opened<00:03:13.030> it<00:03:13.120> a<00:03:13.210> little<00:03:13.450> bit

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:13.690 
close it actually opened it a little bit

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:16.200 
close it actually opened it a little bit
too<00:03:13.870> much<00:03:14.370> so<00:03:15.370> the<00:03:15.550> little<00:03:15.790> piece<00:03:15.940> of<00:03:16.090> wire

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:16.210 
too much so the little piece of wire

00:03:16.210 --> 00:03:17.910 
too much so the little piece of wire
actually<00:03:16.690> works<00:03:16.930> better<00:03:17.110> but<00:03:17.410> as<00:03:17.560> you<00:03:17.710> can<00:03:17.860> see

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:17.920 
actually works better but as you can see

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:21.480 
actually works better but as you can see
works<00:03:18.820> perfect<00:03:19.360> I'm<00:03:19.570> assuming<00:03:20.200> that<00:03:20.490> other

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:21.490 
works perfect I'm assuming that other

00:03:21.490 --> 00:03:23.580 
works perfect I'm assuming that other
people<00:03:22.030> like<00:03:22.210> you<00:03:22.390> super<00:03:22.780> la<00:03:22.960> pista<00:03:23.320> I'm

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:23.590 
people like you super la pista I'm

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:26.070 
people like you super la pista I'm
assuming<00:03:24.580> that<00:03:24.760> probably<00:03:25.330> most<00:03:25.630> of<00:03:25.900> them

00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:26.080 
assuming that probably most of them

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:28.260 
assuming that probably most of them
would<00:03:26.470> be<00:03:26.620> the<00:03:26.740> same<00:03:26.920> problem<00:03:27.220> I<00:03:27.520> hope<00:03:27.850> that

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:28.270 
would be the same problem I hope that

00:03:28.270 --> 00:03:32.100 
would be the same problem I hope that
that<00:03:28.450> helps<00:03:28.510> you<00:03:29.850> not<00:03:30.850> positive<00:03:31.420> it<00:03:31.600> if<00:03:31.870> it

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:32.110 
that helps you not positive it if it

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:36.980 
that helps you not positive it if it
will<00:03:32.290> but<00:03:33.240> hopefully<00:03:34.240> that<00:03:35.430> the<00:03:36.430> other<00:03:36.580> lights

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:36.990 
will but hopefully that the other lights

00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:39.990 
will but hopefully that the other lights
that<00:03:37.990> is<00:03:38.110> just<00:03:38.350> the<00:03:38.470> same<00:03:38.650> problem<00:03:39.100> you<00:03:39.880> know

00:03:39.990 --> 00:03:40.000 
that is just the same problem you know

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.330 
that is just the same problem you know
it<00:03:40.360> seems<00:03:40.630> like<00:03:40.750> like<00:03:41.590> some<00:03:41.830> of<00:03:41.950> these<00:03:42.040> lights

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:42.340 
it seems like like some of these lights

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:44.250 
it seems like like some of these lights
you<00:03:42.520> know<00:03:42.670> I<00:03:42.700> know<00:03:42.880> the<00:03:43.180> ultrafire<00:03:43.750> some<00:03:44.200> of

you know I know the ultrafire some of

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:45.570 
you know I know the ultrafire some of
the<00:03:44.320> other<00:03:44.470> ones<00:03:44.650> are<00:03:44.890> actually<00:03:45.040> pretty<00:03:45.490> good

00:03:45.570 --> 00:03:45.580 
the other ones are actually pretty good

the other ones are actually pretty good
