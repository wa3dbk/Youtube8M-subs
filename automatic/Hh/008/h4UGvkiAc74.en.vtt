in<00:06:54.009> fact<00:06:54.220> that<00:06:54.400> we<00:06:54.520> probably<00:06:54.729> quicker<00:06:55.120> than

00:06:55.530 --> 00:06:55.540 
in fact that we probably quicker than

in fact that we probably quicker than
the<00:06:55.690> one<00:06:56.050> then<00:06:56.410> the<00:06:56.530> second<00:06:56.889> lap<00:06:58.590> but<00:06:59.590> there's

00:06:59.730 --> 00:06:59.740 
the one then the second lap but there's

00:06:59.740 --> 00:07:01.950 
the one then the second lap but there's
only<00:06:59.830> maybe<00:07:00.699> a<00:07:00.880> secondly<00:07:01.419> so<00:07:01.630> people

00:07:01.950 --> 00:07:01.960 
only maybe a secondly so people

00:07:01.960 --> 00:07:05.490 
only maybe a secondly so people
repeating<00:07:02.259> me<00:07:02.350> boy<00:07:02.850> 20<00:07:03.850> seconds<00:07:04.240> in<00:07:04.419> one<00:07:05.199> story

or<00:07:05.590> not<00:07:05.889> seems<00:07:06.490> at<00:07:10.320> that<00:07:11.320> time<00:07:11.650> so<00:07:11.979> here<00:07:12.130> we<00:07:12.220> go

00:07:12.920 --> 00:07:12.930 
or not seems at that time so here we go

00:07:12.930 --> 00:07:16.290 
or not seems at that time so here we go
144<00:07:13.930> that<00:07:14.169> was<00:07:14.320> the<00:07:14.530> third<00:07:14.830> lap<00:07:15.250> that<00:07:15.940> was<00:07:15.970> my

00:07:16.290 --> 00:07:16.300 
144 that was the third lap that was my

00:07:16.300 --> 00:07:17.580 
144 that was the third lap that was my
best<00:07:16.509> one<00:07:16.660> but<00:07:16.780> the<00:07:16.870> second<00:07:17.229> that<00:07:17.289> I'm<00:07:17.380> sure

00:07:17.580 --> 00:07:17.590 
best one but the second that I'm sure

00:07:17.590 --> 00:07:20.879 
best one but the second that I'm sure
was<00:07:17.710> only<00:07:17.919> about<00:07:17.979> 145<00:07:18.960> so<00:07:19.960> there<00:07:20.500> was<00:07:20.590> nothing

00:07:20.879 --> 00:07:20.889 
was only about 145 so there was nothing

00:07:20.889 --> 00:07:23.790 
was only about 145 so there was nothing
in<00:07:21.010> anyway<00:07:22.110> right<00:07:23.110> so<00:07:23.139> that's<00:07:23.410> going<00:07:23.560> to<00:07:23.650> need

00:07:23.790 --> 00:07:23.800 
in anyway right so that's going to need

00:07:23.800 --> 00:07:28.140 
in anyway right so that's going to need
a<00:07:23.860> service<00:07:26.340> which<00:07:27.340> probably<00:07:27.610> put<00:07:27.880> room<00:07:28.000> for

00:07:28.140 --> 00:07:28.150 
a service which probably put room for

00:07:28.150 --> 00:07:30.570 
a service which probably put room for
service<00:07:28.479> now<00:07:28.810> and<00:07:29.080> I<00:07:29.169> will<00:07:29.410> come<00:07:29.680> back<00:07:29.710> they
