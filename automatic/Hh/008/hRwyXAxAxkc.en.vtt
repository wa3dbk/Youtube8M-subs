the attachment that you put on the

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:23.480 
the attachment that you put on the
headphones<00:00:22.230> that<00:00:22.619> this<00:00:22.859> magnetically

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:23.490 
headphones that this magnetically

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:26.450 
headphones that this magnetically
attaches<00:00:24.029> to<00:00:24.269> like<00:00:25.260> in<00:00:25.410> this<00:00:25.529> mesh<00:00:25.740> area<00:00:26.070> here

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:26.460 
attaches to like in this mesh area here

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:28.310 
attaches to like in this mesh area here
and<00:00:26.609> then<00:00:26.730> over<00:00:26.970> here<00:00:27.000> you've<00:00:27.359> got<00:00:27.539> plenty<00:00:28.140> of

just one long cable and it comes with

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:38.330 
just one long cable and it comes with
this<00:00:36.570> windscreen<00:00:37.079> I'm<00:00:37.770> using<00:00:37.980> it<00:00:38.160> right<00:00:38.190> now

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:38.340 
this windscreen I'm using it right now

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:41.030 
this windscreen I'm using it right now
to<00:00:38.520> record<00:00:39.030> the<00:00:39.149> whole<00:00:39.329> video<00:00:39.480> and<00:00:39.980> there's<00:00:40.980> a

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:41.040 
to record the whole video and there's a

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:46.310 
to record the whole video and there's a
magnetic<00:00:41.550> attachment<00:00:43.430> right<00:00:44.430> over<00:00:44.640> here<00:00:45.320> you

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
magnetic attachment right over here you

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:48.319 
magnetic attachment right over here you
can<00:00:46.440> still<00:00:46.530> hear<00:00:46.950> me<00:00:47.010> so<00:00:47.820> there's<00:00:48.000> a<00:00:48.059> magnetic

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329 
can still hear me so there's a magnetic

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:50.690 
can still hear me so there's a magnetic
attachment<00:00:48.660> that's<00:00:49.110> right<00:00:49.410> here<00:00:49.710> I'll<00:00:50.370> show

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:25.550 

it's<00:01:23.610> a<00:01:23.670> magnet<00:01:24.060> and<00:01:24.329> then<00:01:24.840> the<00:01:24.930> other<00:01:25.110> side<00:01:25.439> of

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
it's a magnet and then the other side of

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:27.530 
it's a magnet and then the other side of
the<00:01:25.619> magnet<00:01:25.829> is<00:01:26.610> what<00:01:26.790> attaches<00:01:27.030> to<00:01:27.509> your

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:27.540 
the magnet is what attaches to your

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:32.060 
the magnet is what attaches to your
headphone<00:01:28.110> surface<00:01:28.680> with<00:01:29.549> some<00:01:29.850> adhesive<00:01:31.070> so

headphone surface with some adhesive so

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:34.609 
headphone surface with some adhesive so
that's<00:01:32.220> how<00:01:32.430> it<00:01:32.850> actually<00:01:32.909> works

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:34.619 
that's how it actually works

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:37.149 
that's how it actually works

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 
magnetic pieces that it comes with looks

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:44.719 
magnetic pieces that it comes with looks
like<00:01:40.920> so<00:01:41.460> you<00:01:41.490> get<00:01:41.909> two<00:01:42.240> of<00:01:42.270> these<00:01:43.310> these<00:01:44.310> will

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:44.729 
like so you get two of these these will

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:48.260 
like so you get two of these these will
go<00:01:44.970> on<00:01:45.920> these<00:01:46.920> will<00:01:47.130> go<00:01:47.310> on<00:01:47.520> the<00:01:47.880> headphone

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
go on these will go on the headphone

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:49.700 
go on these will go on the headphone
itself<00:01:48.420> what<00:01:48.810> you<00:01:48.899> do<00:01:49.020> is<00:01:49.140> you<00:01:49.259> just<00:01:49.289> remove

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:49.710 
itself what you do is you just remove

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:52.100 
itself what you do is you just remove
this<00:01:49.860> 3m<00:01:50.310> backing<00:01:50.880> here<00:01:51.149> and<00:01:51.360> you<00:01:51.420> push<00:01:51.720> it<00:01:51.750> on

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:52.110 
this 3m backing here and you push it on

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:54.320 
this 3m backing here and you push it on
to<00:01:52.649> wherever<00:01:52.830> you<00:01:53.039> want<00:01:53.069> to<00:01:53.280> mount<00:01:53.490> most

to wherever you want to mount most

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:56.690 
to wherever you want to mount most
people<00:01:54.509> probably<00:01:54.630> put<00:01:54.899> it<00:01:54.990> like<00:01:55.110> here<00:01:55.470> you<00:01:56.429> put

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 
people probably put it like here you put

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:58.070 
people probably put it like here you put
it<00:01:56.819> put<00:01:56.970> it<00:01:57.090> wherever<00:01:57.240> you<00:01:57.390> want<00:01:57.420> to<00:01:57.659> mount<00:01:57.869> the

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:00.990 
mic and it's got a strong magnet on it

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:03.440 
mic and it's got a strong magnet on it
and<00:02:01.170> basically<00:02:01.740> you<00:02:01.979> just<00:02:02.069> take<00:02:02.880> this<00:02:03.090> part<00:02:03.360> of

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:03.450 
and basically you just take this part of

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:05.570 
and basically you just take this part of
the<00:02:03.509> mic<00:02:03.630> when<00:02:03.810> we<00:02:03.959> screw<00:02:04.229> on<00:02:04.409> the<00:02:04.979> other<00:02:05.009> part

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:05.580 
the mic when we screw on the other part

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:07.279 
the mic when we screw on the other part
of<00:02:05.640> the<00:02:05.729> magnet<00:02:06.270> and<00:02:06.450> then<00:02:06.630> it<00:02:06.810> just<00:02:06.959> attaches

00:02:07.279 --> 00:02:07.289 
of the magnet and then it just attaches

00:02:07.289 --> 00:02:09.410 
of the magnet and then it just attaches
magnetically<00:02:08.130> like<00:02:08.850> that<00:02:09.090> and<00:02:09.209> you<00:02:09.269> can

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:09.420 
magnetically like that and you can

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:10.880 
magnetically like that and you can
remove<00:02:09.660> it<00:02:09.869> and<00:02:10.080> you<00:02:10.140> can<00:02:10.289> attach<00:02:10.530> these<00:02:10.739> to

multiple headphones and you can just you
know<00:02:13.049> attach<00:02:13.350> them<00:02:13.590> like<00:02:13.769> to<00:02:13.950> it<00:02:14.130> it's<00:02:15.120> really

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:15.390 
know attach them like to it it's really

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:18.289 
know attach them like to it it's really
simple<00:02:15.660> you<00:02:16.049> just<00:02:16.080> push<00:02:16.440> it<00:02:16.470> on<00:02:16.790> it<00:02:17.790> will<00:02:17.970> stay

00:02:18.289 --> 00:02:18.299 
simple you just push it on it will stay

00:02:18.299 --> 00:02:21.559 
simple you just push it on it will stay
and<00:02:18.599> then<00:02:19.230> you<00:02:20.099> can<00:02:20.310> magnetically<00:02:21.000> attach<00:02:21.330> and

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:26.420 
remove the the mod like at any time and
it<00:02:23.730> works<00:02:23.880> really<00:02:24.239> nicely<00:02:24.739> also<00:02:25.739> this<00:02:26.220> is

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:26.430 
it works really nicely also this is

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:29.390 
it works really nicely also this is
really<00:02:26.459> bendable<00:02:27.359> and<00:02:27.750> it<00:02:28.560> actually

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:29.400 
really bendable and it actually

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:32.780 
really bendable and it actually
maintains<00:02:29.670> its<00:02:30.209> position<00:02:30.269> very<00:02:31.049> well<00:02:31.790> most

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:32.790 
maintains its position very well most

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:35.479 
maintains its position very well most
not<00:02:33.450> most<00:02:33.750> but<00:02:33.989> a<00:02:34.019> lot<00:02:34.350> of<00:02:34.380> mic<00:02:35.040> booms<00:02:35.310> I've

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:38.720 
used on a lot of gaming headsets don't
even<00:02:37.410> like<00:02:37.859> you<00:02:37.980> bend<00:02:38.190> them<00:02:38.340> a<00:02:38.430> lot<00:02:38.609> because

everybody else's anyway I'm just turning
off<00:03:14.069> boost<00:03:14.370> to<00:03:14.609> avoid<00:03:14.880> any<00:03:15.030> extra<00:03:15.389> input

off boost to avoid any extra input

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:18.140 
off boost to avoid any extra input
distortion<00:03:16.290> that<00:03:16.739> would<00:03:16.889> happen<00:03:17.280> from<00:03:17.880> being

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:18.150 
distortion that would happen from being

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:20.449 
distortion that would happen from being
this<00:03:18.239> close<00:03:18.450> to<00:03:18.750> my<00:03:18.810> mouth<00:03:19.049> and<00:03:19.459> that's

00:03:20.449 --> 00:03:20.459 
this close to my mouth and that's

00:03:20.459 --> 00:03:22.610 
this close to my mouth and that's
basically<00:03:20.910> it<00:03:21.030> it's<00:03:21.569> not<00:03:21.780> that<00:03:21.959> much<00:03:22.139> to<00:03:22.440> it

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:22.620 
basically it it's not that much to it

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:25.340 
basically it it's not that much to it
but<00:03:23.010> it's<00:03:23.850> a<00:03:24.000> really<00:03:24.389> good<00:03:24.540> mic<00:03:24.780> and<00:03:25.170> it's

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:25.350 
but it's a really good mic and it's

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:26.930 
but it's a really good mic and it's
actually<00:03:25.709> a<00:03:25.769> game<00:03:25.950> changer<00:03:26.400> for<00:03:26.430> me<00:03:26.609> because

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:26.940 
actually a game changer for me because

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:28.729 
actually a game changer for me because
now<00:03:27.150> I<00:03:27.480> don't<00:03:27.930> really<00:03:28.230> need<00:03:28.290> to<00:03:28.440> rely<00:03:28.709> on

00:03:28.729 --> 00:03:28.739 
now I don't really need to rely on

00:03:28.739 --> 00:03:30.979 
now I don't really need to rely on
gaming<00:03:29.220> headsets<00:03:29.609> anymore<00:03:30.030> I<00:03:30.269> can<00:03:30.750> just<00:03:30.870> use

00:03:30.979 --> 00:03:30.989 
gaming headsets anymore I can just use

00:03:30.989 --> 00:03:33.080 
gaming headsets anymore I can just use
whatever<00:03:31.260> pair<00:03:31.620> of<00:03:31.680> headphones<00:03:31.799> I<00:03:32.100> want<00:03:32.310> stick

great<00:03:47.550> product<00:03:48.060> really<00:03:48.930> nice<00:03:49.140> I<00:03:49.530> was<00:03:50.040> been

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:50.160 
great product really nice I was been

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:51.380 
great product really nice I was been
around<00:03:50.340> for<00:03:50.490> a<00:03:50.550> while<00:03:50.730> did<00:03:51.000> a<00:03:51.060> couple<00:03:51.330> of

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:51.390 
around for a while did a couple of

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:53.750 
around for a while did a couple of
iterations<00:03:51.960> this<00:03:52.170> one's<00:03:52.380> really<00:03:52.560> cool<00:03:52.890> it's

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:53.760 
iterations this one's really cool it's

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:59.960 
iterations this one's really cool it's
even<00:03:54.060> got<00:03:54.240> a<00:03:54.510> mute<00:03:54.870> switch

00:03:59.960 --> 00:03:59.970 

00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:03.240 

so<00:04:00.970> that<00:04:01.270> also<00:04:01.480> works<00:04:01.840> you<00:04:02.680> can<00:04:02.890> get<00:04:03.160> it

00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:03.250 
so that also works you can get it

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:04.620 
so that also works you can get it
without<00:04:03.400> the<00:04:03.640> mute<00:04:03.790> switch<00:04:03.940> with<00:04:04.330> the<00:04:04.360> mute

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:04.630 
without the mute switch with the mute

00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:08.190 
without the mute switch with the mute
switch<00:04:04.930> and<00:04:05.290> you<00:04:05.770> can<00:04:05.920> also<00:04:06.040> buy<00:04:06.400> the<00:04:07.200> magnetic

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:08.200 
switch and you can also buy the magnetic

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:09.930 
switch and you can also buy the magnetic
pieces<00:04:08.680> separately<00:04:09.370> if<00:04:09.460> you<00:04:09.520> want<00:04:09.700> some<00:04:09.820> extra

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:09.940 
pieces separately if you want some extra

00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:12.000 
pieces separately if you want some extra
ones<00:04:10.210> for<00:04:10.390> extra<00:04:10.780> headphones<00:04:11.230> so<00:04:11.800> you<00:04:11.890> can

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:12.010 
ones for extra headphones so you can

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:13.020 
ones for extra headphones so you can
attach<00:04:12.250> it<00:04:12.280> to<00:04:12.610> you<00:04:12.760> know<00:04:12.850> multiple

00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:13.030 
attach it to you know multiple

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:14.670 
attach it to you know multiple
headphones<00:04:13.570> rotate<00:04:14.050> around<00:04:14.170> whatever<00:04:14.560> you

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:14.680 
headphones rotate around whatever you
