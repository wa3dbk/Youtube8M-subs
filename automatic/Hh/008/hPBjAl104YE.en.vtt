00:00:00.319 --> 00:00:05.730
 Hello everyone in this video I want to show 

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:10.340
 recipe air coconut cake under 

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:14.160
 file name and so let's get started 

00:00:10.340 --> 00:00:16.139
 we'll start with biscuit biscuit with us 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:19.380
 will be on boiling water and for this we 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:23.820
 will need flour eggs sugar 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:26.189
 vanilla sugar and baking powder for 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:27.240
 cream and cream we will consist of 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:30.599
 Mascarpone 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:36.120
 cream fat content and 33 percent and above and 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:39.180
 condensed milk and for decorations we 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:41.730
 take coconut chips and coconut 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:45.000
 slices can be taken and almond slices 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:47.190
 if you find no hidden boiling water 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.110
 different from the classic sponge cake 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:52.110
 that he is dry on it 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:55.829
 you can not soak it and very well 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:59.340
 suitable for fruit cakes so for 

00:00:55.829 --> 00:01:01.640
 start we eggs beat sugarless minutes 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:01.640
 five 

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:13.280
 then add vanilla sugar and 

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:15.140
 granulated sugar 

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:18.259
 and in exactly the same way all this 

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:20.150
 beat only twenty minutes already if 

00:01:18.259 --> 00:01:23.350
 you have a mixer the same manual as mine 

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:27.940
 you will have to try 

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:27.940
 until the mass increases 2 times 

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:38.360
 after that we add mixed flour 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:38.360
 with baking powder 

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:50.119
 and knead the dough with your hand or spatula 

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:53.750
 not tightening the dough and not creating 

00:01:50.119 --> 00:01:57.200
 lumps now after that we add 

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:59.360
 boiling water three tablespoons and 3 

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:02.689
 tablespoons of vegetable oil and 

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:05.600
 just as quickly we knead 

00:02:02.689 --> 00:02:08.390
 our dough form I was 22 

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:13.819
 centimeter in diameter and bake at 

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:16.910
 temperature of 175 degrees for 30-40 minutes at 

00:02:13.819 --> 00:02:19.430
 diameter of 22 centimeters biscuit height 

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:22.549
 It turns out about five centimeters 

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:25.000
 there is such a high enough reserve 

00:02:22.549 --> 00:02:28.220
 sponge cake cool and go in cream 

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:33.200
 as I said in the cream goes 

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:34.610
 Mascarpone is an Italian cheese and he 

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:37.299
 something resembling 

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:37.299
 thick sour cream 

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:45.340
 next we will have cream and 

00:02:42.439 --> 00:02:45.340
 scientists milk 

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:49.880
 Here we are scorpions 

00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:57.810
 like 40 percent sour cream left or them 

00:02:54.690 --> 00:03:02.030
 all this in a bowl and add sugar 

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:04.650
 powder approximately 50 grams depending on 

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:05.870
 that sweet cream you don't want 

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:13.980
 receive 

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:16.230
 punch and a half minutes now 

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:20.400
 add cream I put them on the scales 

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:26.900
 but revo and I will measure 250 now 

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:29.040
 grams is unnatural cream not 

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:30.360
 synthetic like tire tipos so they 

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:33.890
 do not like when they are long 

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:37.700
 you interrupt their texture is not broken and 

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:40.500
 they start start there the other way around 

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:42.950
 liquefy as say places 

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:45.420
 that is, the cream will become very liquid and 

00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:48.630
 back has not recovered 

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:51.240
 so be careful and now add 

00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:53.610
 Condensed milk, again, all by weight 

00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:57.570
 the whole thing we beat about one and a half 

00:03:53.610 --> 00:04:00.840
 minutes all the cream we have is ready to biscuit 

00:03:57.570 --> 00:04:03.230
 we are also ready I cut it into 3 

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:03.230
 parts 

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:13.230
 as I said biscuit i soak 

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:16.920
 I will not but I decided to add a little bit 

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:20.880
 fruit soaked tangerine pieces 

00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:23.360
 the syrup did not die for 5 minutes 

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:27.330
 syrup and and tangerines juice will and 

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:32.730
 is the very impregnation of this 

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:35.180
 biscuit now and distribute from above 

00:04:32.730 --> 00:04:35.180
 cream 

00:04:54.630 --> 00:04:58.400
 top middle cake 

00:05:12.610 --> 00:05:17.370
 again add cream distribute 

00:05:22.009 --> 00:05:27.879
 and put the last cake 

00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:32.389
 inside upwards so that we have 

00:05:27.879 --> 00:05:34.639
 up was smooth and we are now and cream 

00:05:32.389 --> 00:05:37.699
 distributed on the sides and on top and 

00:05:34.639 --> 00:05:41.449
 we begin to decorate the top I sprinkled 

00:05:37.699 --> 00:05:45.229
 coconut cake on the sides already 

00:05:41.449 --> 00:05:47.810

00:05:45.229 --> 00:05:48.770
 the cake turned out so indulge yourself and 

00:05:47.810 --> 00:05:52.190
