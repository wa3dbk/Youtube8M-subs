another<00:00:14.570> Apple<00:00:15.379> Computer<00:00:15.950> collection<00:00:16.580> update

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:16.730 
another Apple Computer collection update

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:19.780 
another Apple Computer collection update
well<00:00:17.720> it's<00:00:18.080> not<00:00:18.259> actually<00:00:18.470> a<00:00:18.740> computer<00:00:19.130> but<00:00:19.580> it

00:00:19.780 --> 00:00:19.790 
well it's not actually a computer but it

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:22.269 
well it's not actually a computer but it
is<00:00:19.910> made<00:00:20.119> by<00:00:20.270> Apple<00:00:20.660> and<00:00:20.990> I<00:00:21.259> do<00:00:21.320> find<00:00:21.830> it<00:00:21.980> to<00:00:22.009> be

00:00:22.269 --> 00:00:22.279 
is made by Apple and I do find it to be

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:26.740 
is made by Apple and I do find it to be
in<00:00:23.290> Apple<00:00:24.290> computer<00:00:24.650> industry<00:00:25.130> a<00:00:25.509> long<00:00:26.509> long

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:26.750 
in Apple computer industry a long long

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:28.780 
in Apple computer industry a long long
time<00:00:27.020> ago<00:00:27.079> in<00:00:27.349> a<00:00:27.559> galaxy<00:00:27.590> far<00:00:27.980> far<00:00:28.220> away

00:00:28.780 --> 00:00:28.790 
time ago in a galaxy far far away

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:32.139 
time ago in a galaxy far far away
well<00:00:29.360> not<00:00:29.599> so<00:00:29.840> much<00:00:30.130> it<00:00:31.130> would<00:00:31.309> be<00:00:31.460> our<00:00:31.579> galaxy

00:00:32.139 --> 00:00:32.149 
well not so much it would be our galaxy

00:00:32.149 --> 00:00:35.740 
well not so much it would be our galaxy
and<00:00:32.559> a<00:00:33.559> long<00:00:34.370> time<00:00:34.550> ago<00:00:34.910> would<00:00:35.120> be<00:00:35.149> around<00:00:35.540> 10

00:00:35.740 --> 00:00:35.750 
and a long time ago would be around 10

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:42.730 
and a long time ago would be around 10
years<00:00:36.079> ago<00:00:36.880> 1999<00:00:38.950> Apple<00:00:39.950> pioneered<00:00:41.200> this<00:00:42.200> new

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:42.740 
years ago 1999 Apple pioneered this new

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:47.650 
years ago 1999 Apple pioneered this new
thing<00:00:43.280> called<00:00:43.330> 802<00:00:44.330> 11<00:00:44.840> and<00:00:46.210> at<00:00:47.210> the<00:00:47.450> time

00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:47.660 
thing called 802 11 and at the time

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:49.540 
thing called 802 11 and at the time
there's<00:00:48.050> a<00:00:48.110> lot<00:00:48.320> of<00:00:48.410> skeptics<00:00:48.890> not<00:00:49.310> many

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:49.550 
there's a lot of skeptics not many

there's a lot of skeptics not many
people<00:00:49.760> were<00:00:50.150> aware<00:00:50.720> of<00:00:50.780> it<00:00:51.110> or<00:00:51.290> knew<00:00:51.980> the<00:00:52.160> full

00:00:52.330 --> 00:00:52.340 
people were aware of it or knew the full

in<00:00:57.610> 1999<00:00:58.780> Apple<00:00:59.780> came<00:00:59.989> out<00:01:00.140> with<00:01:00.200> the<00:01:00.860> airport

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:01.370 
in 1999 Apple came out with the airport

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:07.630 
in 1999 Apple came out with the airport
base<00:01:01.640> station<00:01:02.770> now<00:01:03.770> this<00:01:04.759> thing<00:01:06.130> had<00:01:07.130> a<00:01:07.159> modem

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:07.640 
base station now this thing had a modem

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:11.590 
base station now this thing had a modem
and<00:01:07.790> an<00:01:07.909> Ethernet<00:01:08.030> port<00:01:09.340> modem<00:01:10.340> Ethernet<00:01:11.149> and

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:11.600 
and an Ethernet port modem Ethernet and

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:13.450 
and an Ethernet port modem Ethernet and
then<00:01:11.720> that's<00:01:11.960> power<00:01:12.259> supply<00:01:12.649> right<00:01:12.799> there<00:01:13.009> or

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:13.460 
then that's power supply right there or

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:17.730 
then that's power supply right there or
the<00:01:13.520> power<00:01:13.909> port<00:01:14.479> and<00:01:14.859> it<00:01:15.859> offered<00:01:16.249> fire<00:01:16.579> file

00:01:17.730 --> 00:01:17.740 
the power port and it offered fire file

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:21.249 
the power port and it offered fire file

second not megabytes megabits and it

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:33.489 
second not megabytes megabits and it
came<00:01:30.560> a<00:01:30.619> long<00:01:30.889> way<00:01:31.159> from<00:01:31.729> then<00:01:32.329> till<00:01:32.719> now<00:01:32.929> but

00:01:33.489 --> 00:01:33.499 
came a long way from then till now but

00:01:33.499 --> 00:01:36.609 
came a long way from then till now but
after<00:01:34.310> the<00:01:34.939> first<00:01:35.149> airport<00:01:35.869> base<00:01:36.139> station

00:01:36.609 --> 00:01:36.619 
after the first airport base station

00:01:36.619 --> 00:01:42.550 
after the first airport base station
which<00:01:37.509> I<00:01:39.159> bought<00:01:40.159> this<00:01:40.880> and<00:01:41.299> the<00:01:42.020> next<00:01:42.289> one<00:01:42.469> I'm

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:42.560 
which I bought this and the next one I'm

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:46.029

00:01:59.260 --> 00:01:59.270 
it says Apple Airport base station then

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:05.489 
it says Apple Airport base station then
down<00:01:59.539> here<00:01:59.869> it<00:01:59.990> says<00:02:01.959> 1999<00:02:02.959> Apple<00:02:03.409> computers

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:32.930 
Airport they came out with a second

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:37.000 
Airport they came out with a second
generation<00:02:33.380> in<00:02:33.700> 2001<00:02:35.020> it<00:02:36.020> was<00:02:36.200> known<00:02:36.410> as<00:02:36.620> the

generation in 2001 it was known as the
dual<00:02:37.940> Ethernet<00:02:38.600> or<00:02:38.780> the<00:02:39.170> snow<00:02:39.680> version

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:40.330 
dual Ethernet or the snow version

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:44.980 
dual Ethernet or the snow version
because<00:02:41.830> around<00:02:42.830> this<00:02:43.010> time<00:02:43.340> 2000<00:02:44.060> 2001<00:02:44.690> they

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:44.990 
because around this time 2000 2001 they
