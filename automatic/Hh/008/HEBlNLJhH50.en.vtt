luckily<00:00:00.269> the<00:00:00.510> same<00:00:00.719> mechanics<00:00:01.290> from<00:00:01.500> behind

00:00:01.939 --> 00:00:01.949 
luckily the same mechanics from behind

you<00:00:02.070> honey<00:00:02.399> behind<00:00:02.700> my<00:00:02.760> back<00:00:03.110> now

00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:05.430 
you honey behind my back now

okay<00:00:54.210> I<00:00:54.629> did<00:00:55.500> from<00:00:55.710> the<00:00:55.800> other<00:00:55.949> side<00:00:56.280> you<00:00:56.610> can

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910 
okay I did from the other side you can

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:00.529 
okay I did from the other side you can
come<00:00:57.210> around<00:00:57.329> here<00:00:57.750> so<00:00:57.780> we'll<00:00:58.230> see<00:00:58.410> you<00:00:58.530> I<00:00:59.539> did

00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:00.539 
come around here so we'll see you I did

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:03.860 
come around here so we'll see you I did
from<00:01:01.230> here<00:01:01.530> now<00:01:01.739> okay<00:01:02.219> now<00:01:03.149> it's<00:01:03.539> a<00:01:03.600> little<00:01:03.719> bit

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
from here now okay now it's a little bit

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:06.260 
from here now okay now it's a little bit
on<00:01:04.080> the<00:01:04.199> side<00:01:04.439> here<00:01:04.799> I<00:01:04.920> can<00:01:05.189> hang<00:01:05.400> hey<00:01:05.729> what<00:01:06.210> do

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
on the side here I can hang hey what do

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:12.620 
on the side here I can hang hey what do
you<00:01:06.299> want<00:01:06.390> and<00:01:09.409> see<00:01:10.409> the<00:01:10.560> same<00:01:10.770> mechanics<00:01:11.630> what

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
you want and see the same mechanics what

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:14.359 
you want and see the same mechanics what
was<00:01:12.780> the<00:01:12.930> number<00:01:13.049> one<00:01:13.350> safety<00:01:13.590> we<00:01:13.950> discussed

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369 
was the number one safety we discussed

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:16.160 
was the number one safety we discussed
you<00:01:14.700> ever<00:01:14.880> be<00:01:15.150> in<00:01:15.240> front<00:01:15.570> of<00:01:15.659> the<00:01:15.750> barrel

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
you ever be in front of the barrel

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:21.370 
you ever be in front of the barrel
there's<00:01:16.979> a<00:01:17.040> discharge<00:01:18.710> saying<00:01:19.710> fight<00:01:20.310> okay

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:21.380 
there's a discharge saying fight okay

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:24.020 
there's a discharge saying fight okay
now<00:01:22.380> try<00:01:22.500> to<00:01:22.860> bring<00:01:23.220> out<00:01:23.369> the<00:01:23.520> right<00:01:23.640> but<00:01:23.820> maybe

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
now try to bring out the right but maybe

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:26.600 
now try to bring out the right but maybe
a<00:01:24.180> little<00:01:24.360> bit<00:01:24.540> more<00:01:24.720> of<00:01:24.810> a<00:01:24.869> struggle<00:01:25.170> but<00:01:25.610> just

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610 
a little bit more of a struggle but just

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:27.530 
a little bit more of a struggle but just
fight<00:01:26.880> for<00:01:27.210> it

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:27.540 
fight for it

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:31.569 
fight for it
never<00:01:28.320> let<00:01:28.560> go<00:01:28.640> you<00:01:29.640> have<00:01:29.759> fingers<00:01:30.560> anything

00:01:31.569 --> 00:01:31.579 
never let go you have fingers anything

00:01:31.579 --> 00:01:34.880 
never let go you have fingers anything
just<00:01:32.579> improvise<00:01:33.229> as<00:01:34.229> long<00:01:34.439> as<00:01:34.590> you<00:01:34.710> have

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890 
just improvise as long as you have

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:37.510 
just improvise as long as you have
something<00:01:35.250> here<00:01:35.610> you're<00:01:35.850> trapping<00:01:36.630> rifle

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:37.520 
something here you're trapping rifle

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:40.249 
something here you're trapping rifle
that<00:01:38.520> would<00:01:38.640> be<00:01:38.790> the<00:01:38.939> first<00:01:39.299> important<00:01:40.229> thing

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:40.259 
that would be the first important thing

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:42.609 
that would be the first important thing
okay<00:01:40.710> so<00:01:41.369> keep<00:01:41.790> swallowing<00:01:42.000> it<00:01:42.270> to<00:01:42.420> move

00:01:42.609 --> 00:01:42.619 
okay so keep swallowing it to move

00:01:42.619 --> 00:01:43.969 
okay so keep swallowing it to move
slogging<00:01:43.619> it

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:43.979 
slogging it

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:46.609 
slogging it
hey<00:01:44.159> when<00:01:44.430> one<00:01:44.579> from<00:01:44.880> you<00:01:45.000> to<00:01:45.270> real<00:01:45.630> money<00:01:45.840> yeah

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:46.619 
hey when one from you to real money yeah

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:51.880 
hey when one from you to real money yeah
hit<00:01:47.579> him<00:01:47.630> rip<00:01:48.630> out<00:01:50.270> let's

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:51.890 
hit him rip out let's

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:55.700 
hit him rip out let's
okay<00:01:52.890> real<00:01:53.850> slow<00:01:54.240> no<00:01:54.810> phone<00:01:55.050> same

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:55.710 
okay real slow no phone same

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:59.720 
okay real slow no phone same
biomechanics<00:01:56.550> side<00:01:57.240> turn<00:01:57.600> available<00:01:57.960> so<00:01:58.730> if

00:01:59.720 --> 00:01:59.730 
biomechanics side turn available so if

00:01:59.730 --> 00:02:01.550 
biomechanics side turn available so if
the<00:01:59.850> right<00:02:00.000> tool<00:02:00.240> is<00:02:00.390> from<00:02:00.630> the<00:02:00.810> side<00:02:01.050> where

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:01.560 
the right tool is from the side where

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:05.180 
the right tool is from the side where
would<00:02:01.740> you<00:02:01.860> rotate<00:02:03.290> okay<00:02:04.290> see<00:02:04.620> it<00:02:04.920> doesn't

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:05.190 
would you rotate okay see it doesn't

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:07.010 
would you rotate okay see it doesn't
have<00:02:05.310> to<00:02:05.430> be<00:02:05.550> a<00:02:05.580> scientist<00:02:06.240> to<00:02:06.360> understand<00:02:06.870> it

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:07.020 
have to be a scientist to understand it

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:09.350 
have to be a scientist to understand it
if<00:02:07.560> the<00:02:07.740> rifle<00:02:08.100> is<00:02:08.190> in<00:02:08.340> front<00:02:08.580> when<00:02:09.060> you<00:02:09.090> do<00:02:09.330> a

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:09.360 
if the rifle is in front when you do a

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:12.890 
if the rifle is in front when you do a
tail<00:02:09.540> bone<00:02:09.840> okay<00:02:10.550> you're<00:02:11.550> going<00:02:11.730> to<00:02:11.790> trap<00:02:12.060> okay

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:12.900 
tail bone okay you're going to trap okay

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:16.850 
tail bone okay you're going to trap okay
and<00:02:13.260> you<00:02:13.710> okay<00:02:14.430> supervising<00:02:15.150> see<00:02:15.750> so<00:02:15.990> what<00:02:16.770> I'm

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:16.860 
and you okay supervising see so what I'm

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:18.380 
and you okay supervising see so what I'm
saying<00:02:17.160> as<00:02:17.280> long<00:02:17.520> as<00:02:17.730> you're<00:02:17.850> not<00:02:18.000> in<00:02:18.090> front<00:02:18.210> of

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:18.390 
saying as long as you're not in front of

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:19.910 
saying as long as you're not in front of
this<00:02:18.540> this<00:02:18.720> is<00:02:18.780> what<00:02:19.170> will<00:02:19.410> kill<00:02:19.620> you

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:19.920 
this this is what will kill you

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:22.280 
this this is what will kill you
the<00:02:20.040> rest<00:02:20.280> is<00:02:20.460> nothing<00:02:21.360> let's<00:02:21.840> fight<00:02:22.050> through

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:22.290 
the rest is nothing let's fight through

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:23.540 
the rest is nothing let's fight through
it<00:02:22.400> okay

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:23.550 
it okay

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:25.790 
it okay
please<00:02:23.790> sake<00:02:24.510> die<00:02:24.630> Steve<00:02:24.900> it's<00:02:25.080> okay<00:02:25.440> just<00:02:25.680> to
