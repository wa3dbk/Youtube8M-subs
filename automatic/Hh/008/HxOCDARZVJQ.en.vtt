think about your fingering that's which

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:50.199 
think about your fingering that's which
finger<00:02:48.200> used<00:02:48.440> to<00:02:48.590> play<00:02:48.770> each<00:02:48.980> note<00:02:49.209> basically

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:22.610 

so<00:03:20.370> you<00:03:20.430> don't<00:03:20.640> end<00:03:20.819> up<00:03:20.970> in<00:03:21.060> knots<00:03:21.620> otherwise

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:22.620 
so you don't end up in knots otherwise

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:23.860 
so you don't end up in knots otherwise
it's<00:03:22.830> all<00:03:22.950> pretty<00:03:23.130> much<00:03:23.310> common<00:03:23.610> sense

although if you want to improve your
fingering<00:03:26.310> you<00:03:26.760> have<00:03:26.849> to<00:03:26.970> practice<00:03:27.360> some

mind for the lead and it's not just that

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:11.540 
mind for the lead and it's not just that
you're<00:05:10.020> trying<00:05:10.290> to<00:05:10.440> emulate<00:05:11.160> a<00:05:11.190> guitar

00:05:11.540 --> 00:05:11.550 
you're trying to emulate a guitar

00:05:11.550 --> 00:05:13.070 
you're trying to emulate a guitar
because<00:05:11.730> guitar<00:05:12.210> could<00:05:12.360> not<00:05:12.570> do<00:05:12.720> the<00:05:12.840> things

00:05:13.070 --> 00:05:13.080 
because guitar could not do the things

00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:15.050 
because guitar could not do the things
that<00:05:13.650> you<00:05:13.890> can<00:05:14.070> do<00:05:14.190> on<00:05:14.310> a<00:05:14.340> keyboard<00:05:14.550> so<00:05:15.000> you

00:05:15.050 --> 00:05:15.060 
that you can do on a keyboard so you

00:05:15.060 --> 00:05:16.630 
that you can do on a keyboard so you
obviously<00:05:15.690> come<00:05:15.840> up<00:05:15.960> with<00:05:16.110> different

00:05:16.630 --> 00:05:16.640 
obviously come up with different

00:05:16.640 --> 00:05:19.280 
obviously come up with different
sequences<00:05:17.640> of<00:05:17.730> notes<00:05:17.940> and<00:05:18.300> that's<00:05:18.930> where<00:05:19.110> it

00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:19.290 
sequences of notes and that's where it

00:05:19.290 --> 00:05:20.480 
sequences of notes and that's where it
really<00:05:19.530> gets<00:05:19.620> interesting<00:05:19.830> because<00:05:20.220> it

00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:20.490 
really gets interesting because it

00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:22.190 
really gets interesting because it
sounds<00:05:20.820> like<00:05:20.910> a<00:05:20.940> guitar<00:05:21.180> but<00:05:21.750> something<00:05:22.020> tells

00:05:22.190 --> 00:05:22.200 
sounds like a guitar but something tells

00:05:22.200 --> 00:06:02.640 
sounds like a guitar but something tells
you<00:05:22.460> the<00:05:23.460> guitar<00:05:23.700> couldn't<00:05:23.970> do<00:05:24.060> that

00:06:02.640 --> 00:06:02.650 

00:06:02.650 --> 00:06:04.720 

we've<00:06:03.650> been<00:06:03.770> talking<00:06:03.950> about<00:06:04.100> the<00:06:04.280> differences

00:06:04.720 --> 00:06:04.730 
we've been talking about the differences

00:06:04.730 --> 00:06:08.260 
we've been talking about the differences
between<00:06:05.410> playing<00:06:06.410> at<00:06:06.650> a<00:06:06.890> desk<00:06:07.130> so<00:06:07.940> to<00:06:08.000> speak

00:06:08.260 --> 00:06:08.270 
between playing at a desk so to speak

00:06:08.270 --> 00:06:12.220 
between playing at a desk so to speak
and<00:06:09.070> out<00:06:10.070> in<00:06:10.220> the<00:06:10.310> field<00:06:10.520> and<00:06:11.030> other<00:06:11.780> than<00:06:11.930> just

00:06:12.220 --> 00:06:12.230 
and out in the field and other than just

00:06:12.230 --> 00:06:15.730 
and out in the field and other than just
being<00:06:12.370> it's<00:06:13.370> it's<00:06:14.150> got<00:06:14.300> a<00:06:14.330> few<00:06:14.510> more<00:06:14.740> tricks

00:06:15.730 --> 00:06:15.740 
being it's it's got a few more tricks

00:06:15.740 --> 00:06:18.010 
being it's it's got a few more tricks
that<00:06:16.310> you<00:06:16.490> have<00:06:16.580> to<00:06:16.670> learn<00:06:16.820> once<00:06:17.300> the<00:06:17.510> keyboard

00:06:18.010 --> 00:06:18.020 
that you have to learn once the keyboard

00:06:18.020 --> 00:06:19.750 
that you have to learn once the keyboard
is<00:06:18.110> to<00:06:18.260> hang<00:06:18.410> this<00:06:18.620> way<00:06:18.860> but<00:06:19.250> the<00:06:19.340> main<00:06:19.550> thing

00:06:19.750 --> 00:06:19.760 
is to hang this way but the main thing

00:06:19.760 --> 00:06:21.160 
is to hang this way but the main thing
is<00:06:19.790> that<00:06:19.940> it's<00:06:20.210> a<00:06:20.450> whole<00:06:20.630> lot<00:06:20.750> more<00:06:20.870> fun

00:06:21.160 --> 00:06:21.170 
is that it's a whole lot more fun

00:06:21.170 --> 00:06:24.670 
is that it's a whole lot more fun
because<00:06:21.920> you<00:06:22.070> can<00:06:22.250> go<00:06:22.640> out<00:06:22.670> there<00:06:23.000> and<00:06:23.350> just<00:06:24.350> do

00:06:24.670 --> 00:06:24.680 
because you can go out there and just do

00:06:24.680 --> 00:06:34.159 
because you can go out there and just do
it

00:06:34.159 --> 00:06:34.169 

00:06:34.169 --> 00:06:36.230 

so<00:06:34.680> what<00:06:34.979> can<00:06:35.099> a<00:06:35.159> drummer<00:06:35.460> learn<00:06:35.879> from<00:06:36.060> all

00:06:36.230 --> 00:06:36.240 
so what can a drummer learn from all

00:06:36.240 --> 00:06:38.719 
so what can a drummer learn from all
this<00:06:36.360> lot<00:06:36.599> well<00:06:37.289> when<00:06:37.800> it<00:06:37.919> comes<00:06:38.099> to<00:06:38.189> soloing<00:06:38.639> I

00:06:38.719 --> 00:06:38.729 
this lot well when it comes to soloing I

00:06:38.729 --> 00:06:40.100 
this lot well when it comes to soloing I
suppose<00:06:38.939> the<00:06:39.090> drums<00:06:39.330> are<00:06:39.539> a<00:06:39.569> bit<00:06:39.779> different

00:06:40.100 --> 00:06:40.110 
suppose the drums are a bit different

00:06:40.110 --> 00:06:41.839 
suppose the drums are a bit different
from<00:06:40.199> other<00:06:40.409> instruments<00:06:41.009> first<00:06:41.580> of<00:06:41.729> all

00:06:41.839 --> 00:06:41.849 
from other instruments first of all

00:06:41.849 --> 00:06:43.279 
from other instruments first of all
there's<00:06:42.060> the<00:06:42.150> awful<00:06:42.419> cliche<00:06:42.870> of<00:06:42.990> the<00:06:43.080> band

00:06:43.279 --> 00:06:43.289 
there's the awful cliche of the band

00:06:43.289 --> 00:06:45.110 
there's the awful cliche of the band
walking<00:06:43.680> off<00:06:43.800> stage<00:06:44.069> and<00:06:44.099> leaving<00:06:44.669> you<00:06:44.789> to<00:06:44.969> it

00:06:45.110 --> 00:06:45.120 
walking off stage and leaving you to it

00:06:45.120 --> 00:06:48.019 
walking off stage and leaving you to it
that<00:06:45.569> is<00:06:45.779> you've<00:06:46.020> got<00:06:46.199> no<00:06:46.349> backing<00:06:46.590> also<00:06:47.580> of

00:06:48.019 --> 00:06:48.029 
that is you've got no backing also of

00:06:48.029 --> 00:06:49.339 
that is you've got no backing also of
course<00:06:48.210> you've<00:06:48.389> got<00:06:48.509> no<00:06:48.659> true<00:06:48.960> way<00:06:49.169> of

00:06:49.339 --> 00:06:49.349 
course you've got no true way of

00:06:49.349 --> 00:06:51.559 
course you've got no true way of
utilizing<00:06:49.529> melody<00:06:50.370> and<00:06:50.550> harmony<00:06:50.699> this

00:06:51.559 --> 00:06:51.569 
utilizing melody and harmony this

00:06:51.569 --> 00:06:53.269 
utilizing melody and harmony this
doesn't<00:06:51.990> mean<00:06:52.110> however<00:06:52.289> that<00:06:52.590> you<00:06:52.919> can't<00:06:53.159> be
