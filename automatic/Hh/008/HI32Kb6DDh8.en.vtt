Seth Rollins has turned his back on the

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:06.530 
Seth Rollins has turned his back on the
shield<00:00:04.319> and<00:00:04.620> joined<00:00:05.370> evolution<00:00:06.089> in<00:00:06.270> a

00:00:06.530 --> 00:00:06.540 
shield and joined evolution in a

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:08.990 
shield and joined evolution in a
stunning<00:00:06.960> and<00:00:07.370> surprising<00:00:08.370> moment<00:00:08.730> that<00:00:08.970> I

00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:09.000 
stunning and surprising moment that I

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.830 
stunning and surprising moment that I
actually<00:00:09.240> loved<00:00:09.750> on<00:00:10.019> Raw<00:00:10.590> and<00:00:11.300> I<00:00:12.300> think<00:00:12.660> it<00:00:12.750> was

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:12.840 
actually loved on Raw and I think it was

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:15.140 
actually loved on Raw and I think it was
necessary<00:00:13.530> although<00:00:13.889> it's<00:00:14.250> a<00:00:14.340> sad<00:00:14.610> end<00:00:14.940> of<00:00:15.059> an

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:15.150 
necessary although it's a sad end of an

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:17.750 
necessary although it's a sad end of an
era<00:00:15.330> I<00:00:15.480> think<00:00:15.750> it<00:00:15.809> was<00:00:15.900> necessary<00:00:16.760> christos

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:17.760 
era I think it was necessary christos

ovitch what do you think of Seth Rollins

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:24.109 
ovitch what do you think of Seth Rollins
going<00:00:21.330> on<00:00:21.660> devilish<00:00:22.230> it<00:00:23.160> was<00:00:23.310> about<00:00:23.519> time<00:00:23.820> and

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:24.119 
going on devilish it was about time and

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:26.120 
going on devilish it was about time and
as<00:00:24.570> I<00:00:24.720> said<00:00:24.779> in<00:00:24.990> our<00:00:25.080> raw<00:00:25.289> review<00:00:25.650> he<00:00:25.890> was<00:00:26.010> the

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:26.130 
as I said in our raw review he was the

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:28.910 
as I said in our raw review he was the
right<00:00:26.250> person<00:00:26.279> to<00:00:26.640> go<00:00:26.880> because<00:00:27.740> Roman<00:00:28.740> reigns

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:28.920 
right person to go because Roman reigns

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:30.679 
right person to go because Roman reigns
could<00:00:29.279> go<00:00:29.519> he'd<00:00:29.789> probably<00:00:29.970> make<00:00:30.090> a<00:00:30.179> great<00:00:30.420> heel

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:30.689 
could go he'd probably make a great heel

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:33.830 
could go he'd probably make a great heel
and<00:00:31.019> be<00:00:31.320> a<00:00:31.349> big<00:00:31.590> surprise<00:00:31.969> but<00:00:32.969> he's<00:00:33.450> too<00:00:33.600> over

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:33.840 
and be a big surprise but he's too over

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:35.209 
and be a big surprise but he's too over
with<00:00:33.989> the<00:00:34.079> crowd<00:00:34.260> they<00:00:34.559> need<00:00:34.710> to<00:00:34.829> keep<00:00:34.980> that

00:00:35.209 --> 00:00:35.219 
with the crowd they need to keep that

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:37.160 
with the crowd they need to keep that
alive<00:00:35.340> then<00:00:36.210> we<00:00:36.300> have<00:00:36.360> Dean<00:00:36.570> Ambrose<00:00:36.989> who

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:37.170 
alive then we have Dean Ambrose who

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:39.590 
alive then we have Dean Ambrose who
would<00:00:37.290> have<00:00:37.380> done<00:00:37.500> a<00:00:37.530> great<00:00:37.770> job<00:00:37.800> is<00:00:38.309> a<00:00:39.090> perfect

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 
would have done a great job is a perfect

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:41.540 
would have done a great job is a perfect
heel<00:00:39.840> and<00:00:40.050> I<00:00:40.530> can<00:00:40.710> see<00:00:40.890> him<00:00:41.070> fitting<00:00:41.280> into

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550 
heel and I can see him fitting into

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:43.459 
heel and I can see him fitting into
evolution<00:00:42.090> and<00:00:42.270> pulling<00:00:42.570> the<00:00:42.660> slimy<00:00:42.989> move<00:00:43.260> of

00:00:43.459 --> 00:00:43.469 
evolution and pulling the slimy move of

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:45.260 
evolution and pulling the slimy move of
turning<00:00:43.770> his<00:00:43.860> back<00:00:43.890> on<00:00:44.070> the<00:00:44.280> shield<00:00:44.550> but

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:45.270 
turning his back on the shield but

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:47.240 
turning his back on the shield but
because<00:00:45.570> that<00:00:45.840> I<00:00:46.050> can<00:00:46.350> see<00:00:46.559> that<00:00:46.739> that<00:00:47.010> makes

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.250 
because that I can see that that makes

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:49.310 
because that I can see that that makes
it<00:00:47.370> kind<00:00:47.550> of<00:00:47.670> more<00:00:47.850> predictable<00:00:48.329> and<00:00:48.539> it's

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320 
it kind of more predictable and it's

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:51.290 
it kind of more predictable and it's
better<00:00:49.500> for<00:00:49.710> Seth<00:00:49.860> Rollins<00:00:49.969> for<00:00:50.969> the<00:00:51.030> surprise

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 
better for Seth Rollins for the surprise

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:54.139 
better for Seth Rollins for the surprise
factor<00:00:51.750> to<00:00:52.170> do<00:00:52.289> it<00:00:52.379> first<00:00:52.640> it's<00:00:53.640> not<00:00:53.760> only<00:00:53.879> that

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149 
factor to do it first it's not only that

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:55.939 
factor to do it first it's not only that
but<00:00:54.420> Seth<00:00:54.750> Rollins<00:00:54.840> can<00:00:55.260> benefit<00:00:55.649> more<00:00:55.890> from

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:55.949 
but Seth Rollins can benefit more from

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:58.459 
but Seth Rollins can benefit more from
using<00:00:56.550> evolution<00:00:57.000> as<00:00:57.090> a<00:00:57.120> springboard<00:00:57.539> while<00:00:58.440> I

00:00:58.459 --> 00:00:58.469 
using evolution as a springboard while I

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:00.020 
using evolution as a springboard while I
think<00:00:58.770> Dean<00:00:58.920> Ambrose<00:00:59.280> and<00:00:59.309> Roman<00:00:59.520> reigns<00:00:59.789> are

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
think Dean Ambrose and Roman reigns are

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:01.939 
think Dean Ambrose and Roman reigns are
doing<00:01:00.390> perfectly<00:01:00.780> fine<00:01:00.899> on<00:01:01.109> their<00:01:01.500> own<00:01:01.559> and

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
doing perfectly fine on their own and

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:05.630 
doing perfectly fine on their own and
don't<00:01:02.250> need<00:01:02.489> the<00:01:02.640> extra<00:01:02.670> attention<00:01:03.539> I<00:01:04.640> agree

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
don't need the extra attention I agree

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:07.100 
don't need the extra attention I agree
with<00:01:05.670> that<00:01:05.820> and<00:01:06.330> I<00:01:06.420> think<00:01:06.450> this<00:01:06.750> was<00:01:06.960> a<00:01:06.990> good

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
with that and I think this was a good

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:08.600 
with that and I think this was a good
move<00:01:07.439> and<00:01:07.770> I<00:01:08.010> think<00:01:08.220> it's<00:01:08.340> going<00:01:08.400> to<00:01:08.490> be

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
move and I think it's going to be

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:11.000 
move and I think it's going to be
interesting<00:01:08.909> next<00:01:09.900> week<00:01:10.080> live<00:01:10.409> after<00:01:10.830> raw

state of the WB thursday or something I

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:30.620 
state of the WB thursday or something I
think<00:01:28.080> we<00:01:28.170> we<00:01:28.409> really<00:01:28.710> need<00:01:28.860> to<00:01:28.890> do<00:01:29.100> that<00:01:29.630> now

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
think we we really need to do that now

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:32.960 
think we we really need to do that now
so<00:01:31.470> I'm<00:01:31.650> going<00:01:31.770> to<00:01:31.829> do<00:01:31.950> that<00:01:32.130> what<00:01:32.610> do<00:01:32.700> you<00:01:32.820> guys

think<00:01:33.030> of<00:01:33.450> Seth<00:01:33.689> Rollins<00:01:33.810> joining<00:01:34.650> the<00:01:34.860> shield

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
think of Seth Rollins joining the shield

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:36.980 
think of Seth Rollins joining the shield
I<00:01:35.430> mean<00:01:35.729> joining<00:01:36.030> evolution<00:01:36.540> leaving<00:01:36.900> the

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
I mean joining evolution leaving the

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:38.390 
I mean joining evolution leaving the
shield<00:01:37.229> I<00:01:37.439> didn't<00:01:37.920> get<00:01:37.979> to<00:01:38.040> hear<00:01:38.250> from

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400 
shield I didn't get to hear from

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:39.980
