00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:14.810 
with Stefan as well absolutely I think

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:16.270 
with Stefan as well absolutely I think
that<00:02:15.110> is<00:02:15.230> one<00:02:15.380> of<00:02:15.410> the<00:02:15.560> areas<00:02:15.950> that<00:02:15.980> they<00:02:16.250> have

primarily worked on since she's moved to
Stefan<00:02:18.650> last<00:02:18.860> year<00:02:19.250> and<00:02:19.490> it<00:02:20.030> really<00:02:20.209> has<00:02:20.420> shown

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:20.660 
Stefan last year and it really has shown

00:02:24.699 --> 00:02:24.709 
under the 57 seconds so it will be

00:02:24.709 --> 00:02:26.620 
under the 57 seconds so it will be

one double 0.13 so but realistically do
you<00:03:05.330> think<00:03:05.480> she<00:03:05.600> can<00:03:05.750> come<00:03:05.930> home<00:03:05.960> in<00:03:06.260> a<00:03:06.320> one

you think she can come home in a one
all<00:03:08.950> the<00:03:09.070> world<00:03:09.250> she<00:03:09.820> is<00:03:09.850> looking<00:03:10.330> very<00:03:10.360> very

00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:10.720 
all the world she is looking very very

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:13.260 
all the world she is looking very very
comfortable<00:03:11.200> here<00:03:11.770> in<00:03:12.010> I<00:03:12.670> don't<00:03:12.910> think<00:03:13.120> she<00:03:13.240> I

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:13.270 
comfortable here in I don't think she I

00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:14.910 
comfortable here in I don't think she I
think<00:03:13.630> she's<00:03:13.750> really<00:03:13.990> rubbing<00:03:14.470> it<00:03:14.560> up<00:03:14.680> right

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:17.520 
think she's really rubbing it up right
now<00:03:14.980> so<00:03:15.580> I<00:03:15.850> think<00:03:16.330> she<00:03:16.690> picked<00:03:16.840> up<00:03:17.020> a<00:03:17.140> Luger<00:03:17.380> to

00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:25.960 
again because this definitely rice

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:27.720 
again because this definitely rice
that's<00:04:26.230> a<00:04:26.380> two<00:04:26.560> second<00:04:26.950> personal<00:04:27.310> best<00:04:27.490> time

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:27.730

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:29.890 
Sam has already gone at 207 but that

00:04:29.890 --> 00:04:31.800 
Sam has already gone at 207 but that
maybe<00:04:30.370> is<00:04:30.580> faster<00:04:31.030> than<00:04:31.120> what<00:04:31.270> Jess<00:04:31.510> went<00:04:31.720> at

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:31.810 
maybe is faster than what Jess went at

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:33.630 
maybe is faster than what Jess went at
the<00:04:31.900> Olympic<00:04:32.200> Games<00:04:32.230> yeah<00:04:32.800> absolutely<00:04:33.160> that

00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:33.640 
the Olympic Games yeah absolutely that

00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:36.210

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:36.220 
was a great race by Jess I think you

00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:37.620 
was a great race by Jess I think you
know<00:04:36.340> she<00:04:36.610> would<00:04:36.880> have<00:04:37.000> had<00:04:37.090> a<00:04:37.150> bit<00:04:37.330> of<00:04:37.450> time

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:37.630 
know she would have had a bit of time

00:04:37.630 --> 00:04:40.530 
know she would have had a bit of time
off<00:04:37.660> over<00:04:37.990> the<00:04:38.260> after<00:04:39.100> the<00:04:39.220> Olympics<00:04:39.669> so<00:04:39.970> you

00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:40.540 
off over the after the Olympics so you

00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:42.450 
off over the after the Olympics so you
know<00:04:40.660> to<00:04:40.720> go<00:04:40.930> a<00:04:40.960> time<00:04:41.200> like<00:04:41.410> that<00:04:41.440> is<00:04:41.680> fantastic

00:04:42.450 --> 00:04:42.460 
know to go a time like that is fantastic

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:43.860 
know to go a time like that is fantastic
she's<00:04:42.640> throwing<00:04:42.850> her<00:04:43.060> arms<00:04:43.090> forward<00:04:43.660> a<00:04:43.720> lot

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:43.870 
she's throwing her arms forward a lot

00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:45.600 
she's throwing her arms forward a lot
quicker<00:04:44.050> I<00:04:44.380> first<00:04:44.680> start<00:04:44.950> that's<00:04:45.250> one<00:04:45.460> of<00:04:45.550> the

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:45.610 
quicker I first start that's one of the

00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:46.860 
quicker I first start that's one of the
things<00:04:45.790> that<00:04:45.940> I've<00:04:46.000> noticed<00:04:46.180> I'm<00:04:46.480> sure<00:04:46.660> you

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:46.870 
things that I've noticed I'm sure you

00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:48.300 
things that I've noticed I'm sure you
all<00:04:47.230> though<00:04:47.410> you've<00:04:47.590> been<00:04:47.620> racing<00:04:48.040> her<00:04:48.100> so<00:04:48.220> you

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:48.310 
all though you've been racing her so you

00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:49.710 
all though you've been racing her so you
probably<00:04:48.520> haven't<00:04:48.760> been<00:04:48.880> noticing<00:04:49.419> it<00:04:49.540> but

00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:49.720 
probably haven't been noticing it but

00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:51.120 
probably haven't been noticing it but
she<00:04:49.930> has<00:04:50.110> been<00:04:50.380> getting<00:04:50.560> off<00:04:50.800> to<00:04:50.950> a<00:04:50.979> much

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:51.130 
she has been getting off to a much

00:04:51.130 --> 00:04:52.980 
she has been getting off to a much
better<00:04:51.340> start<00:04:51.700> and<00:04:51.940> her<00:04:52.270> technical<00:04:52.660> things

00:04:52.980 --> 00:04:52.990 
better start and her technical things

00:04:52.990 --> 00:04:54.300 
better start and her technical things
like<00:04:53.050> the<00:04:53.290> turns<00:04:53.560> of<00:04:53.740> being

00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:54.310 
like the turns of being

00:04:54.310 --> 00:04:56.410 
like the turns of being
absolutely<00:04:55.310> as<00:04:55.460> I<00:04:55.610> said<00:04:55.790> before<00:04:55.940> I<00:04:56.150> think

00:04:56.410 --> 00:04:56.420 
absolutely as I said before I think

00:04:56.420 --> 00:04:58.450 
absolutely as I said before I think
that's<00:04:56.780> the<00:04:57.140> main<00:04:57.350> thing<00:04:57.650> that<00:04:57.830> Stefan<00:04:58.370> would

00:04:58.450 --> 00:04:58.460 
that's the main thing that Stefan would

00:04:58.460 --> 00:05:01.030 
that's the main thing that Stefan would
have<00:04:58.610> been<00:04:58.760> working<00:04:59.120> on<00:04:59.240> with<00:04:59.450> her<00:04:59.920> you<00:05:00.920> know

00:05:01.030 --> 00:05:01.040 
have been working on with her you know

00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:03.400 
have been working on with her you know
she's<00:05:01.250> a<00:05:01.310> very<00:05:01.490> strong<00:05:01.840> technical<00:05:02.840> swimmer

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:03.410 
she's a very strong technical swimmer

00:05:03.410 --> 00:05:06.340 
she's a very strong technical swimmer
once<00:05:04.100> she's<00:05:04.280> free<00:05:04.970> swimming<00:05:05.270> but<00:05:05.540> the<00:05:06.020> good

00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:06.350 
once she's free swimming but the good

00:05:06.350 --> 00:05:07.450 
once she's free swimming but the good
