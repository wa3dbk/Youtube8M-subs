the actual column to the bed plate but
the<00:00:34.649> best<00:00:34.829> bit<00:00:35.010> about<00:00:35.280> this<00:00:35.430> engine<00:00:35.850> is<00:00:36.059> how

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:36.300 
the best bit about this engine is how

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:39.380 
the best bit about this engine is how
well<00:00:36.510> it<00:00:36.540> runs<00:00:37.219> this<00:00:38.219> is<00:00:38.399> running<00:00:38.820> on<00:00:38.969> lung

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390 
well it runs this is running on lung

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:44.360 
well it runs this is running on lung
power<00:00:39.660> my<00:00:40.290> lung<00:00:40.559> power<00:00:42.950> and<00:00:43.950> as<00:00:44.070> you<00:00:44.129> can<00:00:44.309> see

will<00:00:52.559> let<00:00:52.739> you<00:00:52.860> do<00:00:53.039> this<00:00:53.300> particularly<00:00:54.300> when

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
will let you do this particularly when

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699 
three-quarter inch stroke this is it now

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:05.780 
three-quarter inch stroke this is it now
running<00:01:03.059> on<00:01:03.180> compressed<00:01:03.570> air<00:01:03.979> and<00:01:04.979> it<00:01:05.610> runs

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:05.790 
running on compressed air and it runs

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:09.590 
running on compressed air and it runs
beautifully<00:01:06.180> smoothly<00:01:06.990> very<00:01:07.680> slowly<00:01:08.100> Oh<00:01:08.600> with

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
beautifully smoothly very slowly Oh with

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:12.340 
beautifully smoothly very slowly Oh with
a<00:01:09.630> little<00:01:09.720> more<00:01:10.140> air<00:01:10.320> it<00:01:10.860> will<00:01:11.070> run<00:01:11.250> very<00:01:11.280> fast

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:12.350 
a little more air it will run very fast

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:15.350 
a little more air it will run very fast
I've<00:01:13.350> got<00:01:13.560> a<00:01:13.590> couple<00:01:13.830> of<00:01:14.010> other<00:01:14.250> ten<00:01:14.490> V's<00:01:14.729> and

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360 
I've got a couple of other ten V's and

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:17.210 
I've got a couple of other ten V's and
the<00:01:15.600> great<00:01:15.780> little<00:01:16.110> engines<00:01:16.439> but<00:01:16.860> once<00:01:17.040> again

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
the great little engines but once again

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:19.370 
the great little engines but once again
like<00:01:17.640> all<00:01:17.880> engines<00:01:18.330> it<00:01:18.600> depends<00:01:19.049> how<00:01:19.170> well

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
like all engines it depends how well

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:21.350 
like all engines it depends how well
they're<00:01:19.650> machined<00:01:20.040> and<00:01:20.790> this<00:01:21.000> one's<00:01:21.240> very

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360 
they're machined and this one's very

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:24.920 
they're machined and this one's very
well<00:01:21.810> made<00:01:22.049> and<00:01:22.350> it<00:01:22.890> runs<00:01:23.070> like<00:01:23.189> a<00:01:23.340> dream<00:01:23.930> it's

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930 
well made and it runs like a dream it's

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:26.719 
well made and it runs like a dream it's
the<00:01:25.110> attention<00:01:25.380> to<00:01:25.740> detail<00:01:26.159> is<00:01:26.369> impressive

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
the attention to detail is impressive

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:29.929 
the attention to detail is impressive
with<00:01:27.180> this<00:01:27.330> engine<00:01:27.740> the<00:01:28.740> attention<00:01:29.250> to<00:01:29.430> detail

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:29.939 
with this engine the attention to detail

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:32.960 
with this engine the attention to detail
the<00:01:30.240> small<00:01:31.200> screws<00:01:31.590> holding<00:01:32.220> the<00:01:32.280> banding<00:01:32.850> in

place on the cladding not to mention how
well<00:01:35.909> it<00:01:36.060> runs<00:01:36.409> this<00:01:37.409> is<00:01:37.619> also<00:01:37.770> a<00:01:37.979> very<00:01:38.220> quiet

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:38.520 
well it runs this is also a very quiet

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:40.520 
well it runs this is also a very quiet
engine<00:01:38.820> it<00:01:39.329> sounds<00:01:39.659> louder<00:01:39.900> than<00:01:40.229> it<00:01:40.290> should

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
engine it sounds louder than it should

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:42.560 
engine it sounds louder than it should
do<00:01:40.710> because<00:01:41.009> it's<00:01:41.189> on<00:01:41.340> my<00:01:41.369> soundboard<00:01:42.240> I

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:42.570 
do because it's on my soundboard I

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:44.899 
do because it's on my soundboard I
always<00:01:43.140> work<00:01:43.350> on<00:01:43.530> a<00:01:43.590> sound<00:01:43.950> board<00:01:44.280> which

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:44.909 
always work on a sound board which

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:47.020 
always work on a sound board which
amplifies<00:01:45.149> any<00:01:45.750> knocking<00:01:46.229> and<00:01:46.409> engine<00:01:46.740> makes

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:47.030 
amplifies any knocking and engine makes

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:49.429 
amplifies any knocking and engine makes
to<00:01:48.030> lift<00:01:48.240> it<00:01:48.329> off<00:01:48.479> the<00:01:48.540> sound<00:01:48.899> board<00:01:49.079> it<00:01:49.259> goes

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:49.439 
to lift it off the sound board it goes

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:52.160 
to lift it off the sound board it goes
very<00:01:49.649> quiet<00:01:50.240> never<00:01:51.240> put<00:01:51.420> it<00:01:51.540> down<00:01:51.570> on<00:01:51.930> a<00:01:51.960> piece

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170 
very quiet never put it down on a piece

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:54.859 
very quiet never put it down on a piece
of<00:01:52.380> padding<00:01:52.619> it's<00:01:53.189> also<00:01:53.430> very<00:01:53.850> quiet<00:01:54.149> and<00:01:54.600> it's

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:54.869 
of padding it's also very quiet and it's

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:56.539 
of padding it's also very quiet and it's
only<00:01:55.079> when<00:01:55.320> the<00:01:55.500> engine<00:01:55.799> is<00:01:55.890> in<00:01:56.070> direct

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:56.549 
only when the engine is in direct

00:01:56.549 --> 00:01:58.550 
only when the engine is in direct
contact<00:01:56.969> with<00:01:57.149> the<00:01:57.299> board<00:01:57.509> but<00:01:57.930> it<00:01:58.079> makes<00:01:58.320> a

00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:58.560 
contact with the board but it makes a

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:01.069 
contact with the board but it makes a
different<00:01:59.070> noise<00:01:59.130> I<00:01:59.670> do<00:02:00.149> this<00:02:00.360> on<00:02:00.540> purpose<00:02:00.780> I

00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:01.079 
different noise I do this on purpose I

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:03.280 
different noise I do this on purpose I
like<00:02:01.259> to<00:02:01.409> hear<00:02:01.619> what<00:02:01.770> they<00:02:01.890> really<00:02:02.219> sound<00:02:02.460> like

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:03.290 
like to hear what they really sound like

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:06.230 
like to hear what they really sound like
