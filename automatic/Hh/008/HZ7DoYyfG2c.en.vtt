hurricane season has in store for us in

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:36.709 
hurricane season has in store for us in
a<00:00:34.710> couple<00:00:35.100> of<00:00:35.190> months<00:00:35.579> and<00:00:35.790> we'll<00:00:35.969> see<00:00:36.210> what

00:00:36.709 --> 00:00:36.719 
a couple of months and we'll see what

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:38.119 
a couple of months and we'll see what
the<00:00:36.840> numbers<00:00:37.140> are<00:00:37.260> going<00:00:37.350> to<00:00:37.440> be<00:00:37.559> looking<00:00:37.800> like

00:00:38.119 --> 00:00:38.129 
the numbers are going to be looking like

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:40.010 
the numbers are going to be looking like
but<00:00:38.670> currently<00:00:38.969> let's<00:00:39.239> look<00:00:39.329> at<00:00:39.480> the<00:00:39.600> u.s.

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:40.020 
but currently let's look at the u.s.

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:42.170 
but currently let's look at the u.s.
satellite<00:00:40.530> and<00:00:40.800> we<00:00:40.980> see<00:00:41.219> an<00:00:41.430> abundant<00:00:42.149> amount

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:42.180 
satellite and we see an abundant amount

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:44.240 
satellite and we see an abundant amount
of<00:00:42.420> precipitation<00:00:42.660> in<00:00:43.350> the<00:00:43.410> midsection<00:00:43.950> of

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:44.250 
of precipitation in the midsection of

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:45.860 
of precipitation in the midsection of
the<00:00:44.309> country<00:00:44.430> and<00:00:45.030> this<00:00:45.239> is<00:00:45.420> going<00:00:45.629> to<00:00:45.750> be

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
the country and this is going to be

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:48.560 
the country and this is going to be
making<00:00:46.110> its<00:00:46.379> way<00:00:46.500> towards<00:00:47.309> the<00:00:47.520> Northeast<00:00:48.120> and

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:48.570 
making its way towards the Northeast and

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:51.260 
making its way towards the Northeast and
as<00:00:49.289> it<00:00:49.530> does<00:00:49.559> so<00:00:49.760> precipitation<00:00:50.760> is<00:00:50.910> going<00:00:51.180> to

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.270 
as it does so precipitation is going to

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:53.000 
as it does so precipitation is going to
be<00:00:51.390> on<00:00:51.539> the<00:00:51.629> increase<00:00:51.930> for<00:00:52.440> raleigh-durham

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
be on the increase for raleigh-durham

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:56.000 
be on the increase for raleigh-durham
area<00:00:53.460> as<00:00:53.760> well<00:00:54.300> so<00:00:54.930> taking<00:00:55.199> a<00:00:55.230> closer<00:00:55.469> look<00:00:55.590> at

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
area as well so taking a closer look at

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:57.979 
area as well so taking a closer look at
the<00:00:56.430> southeast<00:00:57.300> we<00:00:57.480> see<00:00:57.600> raleigh-durham

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989 
the southeast we see raleigh-durham

Charleston seeing clear skies there is a

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:02.900 
Charleston seeing clear skies there is a
little<00:01:01.770> bit<00:01:01.859> of<00:01:01.949> green<00:01:02.129> on<00:01:02.280> the<00:01:02.399> map<00:01:02.520> but<00:01:02.760> it's

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
little bit of green on the map but it's

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:05.270 
little bit of green on the map but it's
too<00:01:03.059> dry<00:01:03.329> for<00:01:03.359> the<00:01:03.660> precipitation<00:01:04.290> to<00:01:04.949> be

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280 
too dry for the precipitation to be

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:06.710 
too dry for the precipitation to be
making<00:01:05.640> its<00:01:05.729> way<00:01:05.820> towards<00:01:06.180> the<00:01:06.330> ground<00:01:06.479> so

making its way towards the ground so
right<00:01:06.900> now<00:01:06.930> it<00:01:07.409> is<00:01:07.890> absolutely<00:01:08.700> beautiful

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:16.249 
the way taking a look at this surface
map<00:01:14.250> we<00:01:14.700> see<00:01:14.820> that<00:01:14.970> low<00:01:15.119> pressure<00:01:15.420> system<00:01:16.049> and

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259 
map we see that low pressure system and

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:18.950 
map we see that low pressure system and
as<00:01:16.740> we<00:01:16.950> get<00:01:17.070> into<00:01:17.280> Thursday<00:01:18.240> it<00:01:18.450> is<00:01:18.479> going<00:01:18.840> to

Thursday into Friday and when we see

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:27.980 
Thursday into Friday and when we see
that<00:01:26.009> low<00:01:26.159> pressure<00:01:26.460> system<00:01:26.970> move<00:01:27.210> towards

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990 
that low pressure system move towards

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:29.840 
that low pressure system move towards
the<00:01:28.140> Northeast<00:01:28.500> and<00:01:28.829> then<00:01:29.009> head<00:01:29.310> out<00:01:29.490> toward

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
the Northeast and then head out toward

the Northeast and then head out toward
the<00:01:29.880> Atlantic<00:01:29.970> we<00:01:30.420> are<00:01:30.479> going<00:01:30.600> to<00:01:30.659> see

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 
the Atlantic we are going to see

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:33.530 
the Atlantic we are going to see
precipitation<00:01:31.200> on<00:01:31.950> the<00:01:32.640> way<00:01:32.790> and<00:01:33.119> on<00:01:33.390> the

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:33.540 
precipitation on the way and on the

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:35.630 
precipitation on the way and on the
increase<00:01:33.930> for<00:01:34.350> the<00:01:34.380> next<00:01:34.799> couple<00:01:34.920> of<00:01:35.100> days<00:01:35.280> but

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:35.640 
increase for the next couple of days but

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:39.020 
increase for the next couple of days but
we<00:01:36.299> do<00:01:36.509> see<00:01:36.750> another<00:01:36.960> system<00:01:37.520> right<00:01:38.520> behind<00:01:38.820> it

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030 
we do see another system right behind it

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:40.490 
we do see another system right behind it
but<00:01:39.180> this<00:01:39.299> one<00:01:39.360> shouldn't<00:01:39.750> produce<00:01:40.110> as<00:01:40.320> much

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
but this one shouldn't produce as much

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:42.679 
but this one shouldn't produce as much
precipitation<00:01:40.909> so<00:01:41.909> we're<00:01:42.030> seeing<00:01:42.180> that<00:01:42.390> next

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:42.689 
precipitation so we're seeing that next

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:45.590 
precipitation so we're seeing that next
week<00:01:42.840> is<00:01:43.140> going<00:01:43.979> to<00:01:44.070> be<00:01:44.189> absolutely<00:01:44.939> beautiful

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
week is going to be absolutely beautiful

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:47.630
