00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
brought it home do a little bit of

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:19.310 
brought it home do a little bit of
testing<00:01:17.220> with<00:01:17.400> it<00:01:17.450> took<00:01:18.450> the<00:01:18.570> seat<00:01:18.810> off<00:01:19.020> it's

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
testing with it took the seat off it's

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:22.850 
testing with it took the seat off it's
got<00:01:19.470> twin<00:01:19.830> mikuni<00:01:20.729> carburetors<00:01:20.759> and<00:01:21.740> ended<00:01:22.740> up

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:22.860 
got twin mikuni carburetors and ended up

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:24.740 
got twin mikuni carburetors and ended up
finally<00:01:23.460> kind<00:01:23.759> of<00:01:23.820> getting<00:01:24.060> started<00:01:24.180> but<00:01:24.570> I

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750 
finally kind of getting started but I

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:26.390 
finally kind of getting started but I
couldn't<00:01:25.409> hardly<00:01:25.560> keep<00:01:25.799> it<00:01:25.950> running<00:01:26.250> so<00:01:26.369> I

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 
couldn't hardly keep it running so I

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:28.550 
couldn't hardly keep it running so I
took<00:01:26.490> some<00:01:26.820> carb<00:01:27.540> cleaner<00:01:27.720> and<00:01:28.049> sprayed<00:01:28.350> in

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560 
took some carb cleaner and sprayed in

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:31.219 
took some carb cleaner and sprayed in
the<00:01:29.150> throats<00:01:30.150> of<00:01:30.329> the<00:01:30.390> carburetors<00:01:30.960> and<00:01:31.140> it

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229 
the throats of the carburetors and it

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:33.319 
the throats of the carburetors and it
would<00:01:31.350> rev<00:01:31.560> up<00:01:31.590> and<00:01:32.040> run<00:01:32.490> a<00:01:32.520> bit<00:01:32.759> so<00:01:32.970> I<00:01:33.000> knew<00:01:33.240> it

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:33.329 
would rev up and run a bit so I knew it

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:35.810 
would rev up and run a bit so I knew it
wasn't<00:01:33.509> an<00:01:33.720> electrical<00:01:34.229> problem<00:01:34.790> so<00:01:35.790> I

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820 
wasn't an electrical problem so I

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:37.399 
wasn't an electrical problem so I
thought<00:01:36.240> well<00:01:36.479> spent<00:01:36.840> a<00:01:36.869> little<00:01:37.020> bit<00:01:37.110> of<00:01:37.200> time

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:37.409 
thought well spent a little bit of time

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:39.789 
thought well spent a little bit of time
with<00:01:37.590> the<00:01:37.710> carbs<00:01:38.130> and<00:01:38.310> I<00:01:38.520> pulled<00:01:38.909> them<00:01:39.090> off<00:01:39.240> and

00:01:39.789 --> 00:01:39.799 
with the carbs and I pulled them off and

00:01:39.799 --> 00:01:42.230 
with the carbs and I pulled them off and
took<00:01:40.799> them<00:01:40.979> all<00:01:41.040> apart<00:01:41.430> and<00:01:41.549> there<00:01:41.729> were<00:01:41.820> bugs

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
took them all apart and there were bugs

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:46.639 
took them all apart and there were bugs
inside<00:01:42.899> the<00:01:43.320> fuel<00:01:43.770> bowls<00:01:45.049> just<00:01:46.049> a<00:01:46.259> lot<00:01:46.530> of

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:46.649 
inside the fuel bowls just a lot of

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:48.740 
inside the fuel bowls just a lot of
varnish<00:01:47.100> and<00:01:47.399> both<00:01:47.670> pilot<00:01:48.090> jets<00:01:48.299> were<00:01:48.450> plugged

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:48.750 
varnish and both pilot jets were plugged

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:51.770 
varnish and both pilot jets were plugged
solid<00:01:49.350> so<00:01:49.680> I<00:01:49.950> spent<00:01:50.729> a<00:01:50.790> lot<00:01:50.939> of<00:01:50.970> time<00:01:51.270> probably

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:51.780 
solid so I spent a lot of time probably

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:53.149 
solid so I spent a lot of time probably
three<00:01:51.930> or<00:01:51.990> four<00:01:52.049> hours<00:01:52.530> going<00:01:52.799> through<00:01:52.920> those

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:53.159 
three or four hours going through those

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:54.740 
three or four hours going through those
carbs<00:01:53.610> making<00:01:53.909> sure<00:01:54.060> everything<00:01:54.420> was<00:01:54.570> open

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750 
carbs making sure everything was open

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:58.370 
carbs making sure everything was open
and<00:01:55.200> working<00:01:55.590> good<00:01:55.979> and<00:01:57.140> put<00:01:58.140> it<00:01:58.229> back

and working good and put it back

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:00.709 
and working good and put it back
together<00:01:58.590> put<00:01:59.340> the<00:01:59.520> carbs<00:01:59.850> on<00:02:00.060> it<00:02:00.270> fired<00:02:00.600> right

know<00:02:15.360> this<00:02:16.260> bike<00:02:16.470> was<00:02:16.710> originally<00:02:17.100> jetted<00:02:17.490> for

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:17.700 
know this bike was originally jetted for

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:20.150 
know this bike was originally jetted for
sea<00:02:17.880> level<00:02:18.270> so<00:02:19.170> I<00:02:19.200> started<00:02:19.680> working<00:02:19.980> a<00:02:20.040> little

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:20.160 
sea level so I started working a little

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:22.490 
sea level so I started working a little
bit<00:02:20.340> on<00:02:20.490> the<00:02:20.640> jetting<00:02:21.120> and<00:02:21.330> actually<00:02:21.780> left<00:02:22.320> the

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:22.500 
bit on the jetting and actually left the

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:25.130 
bit on the jetting and actually left the
pilot<00:02:22.950> in<00:02:23.010> the<00:02:23.070> main<00:02:23.280> jet<00:02:23.580> stock<00:02:23.940> but<00:02:24.360> found

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:25.140 
pilot in the main jet stock but found

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:28.760 
pilot in the main jet stock but found
that<00:02:25.970> it<00:02:26.970> really<00:02:27.480> didn't<00:02:28.020> perform<00:02:28.200> very<00:02:28.710> well

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:28.770 
that it really didn't perform very well

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:30.500 
that it really didn't perform very well
on<00:02:29.190> the<00:02:29.310> low<00:02:29.460> end<00:02:29.490> at<00:02:29.850> all<00:02:29.940> they'd<00:02:30.180> have<00:02:30.210> to<00:02:30.420> be

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:30.510 
on the low end at all they'd have to be

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:33.110 
on the low end at all they'd have to be
revved<00:02:30.720> up<00:02:30.900> to<00:02:31.080> about<00:02:31.200> 3,500<00:02:32.100> to<00:02:32.160> 4,000<00:02:32.880> before

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:33.120 
revved up to about 3,500 to 4,000 before

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:34.640 
revved up to about 3,500 to 4,000 before
it<00:02:33.180> really<00:02:33.360> started<00:02:33.600> making<00:02:33.900> any<00:02:33.990> power<00:02:34.290> and

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:34.650 
it really started making any power and

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:37.490 
it really started making any power and
I'm<00:02:35.520> here<00:02:35.760> in<00:02:35.850> Utah<00:02:36.240> we've<00:02:36.600> got<00:02:36.720> trails<00:02:37.140> all

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:37.500 
I'm here in Utah we've got trails all

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:41.600 
I'm here in Utah we've got trails all
over<00:02:37.890> that<00:02:38.570> are<00:02:39.570> so<00:02:40.320> I'm<00:02:40.500> pretty<00:02:40.740> steep<00:02:41.190> the

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:41.610 
over that are so I'm pretty steep the

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:43.250 
over that are so I'm pretty steep the
hard<00:02:42.120> to<00:02:42.180> get<00:02:42.330> around<00:02:42.420> you<00:02:42.750> got<00:02:42.900> to<00:02:42.990> be<00:02:43.080> able<00:02:43.140> to

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:43.260 
hard to get around you got to be able to

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:45.110 
hard to get around you got to be able to
have<00:02:43.410> good<00:02:43.620> low<00:02:43.830> end<00:02:44.100> on<00:02:44.310> some<00:02:44.670> of<00:02:44.790> these<00:02:44.880> heavy

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:45.120 
have good low end on some of these heavy

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:48.470 
have good low end on some of these heavy
bikes<00:02:45.420> so<00:02:46.220> I<00:02:47.220> ended<00:02:47.700> up<00:02:47.820> dropping<00:02:48.330> both

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:48.480 
bikes so I ended up dropping both

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:53.390 
bikes so I ended up dropping both
needles<00:02:48.990> one<00:02:49.980> clip<00:02:50.400> and<00:02:50.840> tried<00:02:51.840> it<00:02:51.990> out<00:02:52.140> and<00:02:52.470> it

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:53.400 
needles one clip and tried it out and it

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:55.400 
needles one clip and tried it out and it
was<00:02:53.910> a<00:02:53.940> lot<00:02:54.180> better<00:02:54.360> in<00:02:54.600> fact<00:02:54.780> we<00:02:54.900> went<00:02:54.990> to

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:55.410 
was a lot better in fact we went to

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:57.740 
was a lot better in fact we went to
through<00:02:55.950> Kennecott<00:02:56.730> Copper<00:02:56.760> Mine<00:02:57.270> area<00:02:57.660> and

00:02:57.740 --> 00:02:57.750 
through Kennecott Copper Mine area and

00:02:57.750 --> 00:02:59.300 
through Kennecott Copper Mine area and
as<00:02:57.870> the<00:02:58.020> higher<00:02:58.200> I<00:02:58.230> got<00:02:58.590> the<00:02:58.770> worse<00:02:58.920> that<00:02:59.100> ran

00:02:59.300 --> 00:02:59.310 
as the higher I got the worse that ran

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:02.540 
as the higher I got the worse that ran
so<00:02:59.520> I<00:02:59.550> know<00:02:59.610> it's<00:02:59.820> too<00:02:59.970> rich<00:03:00.709> so<00:03:01.709> I<00:03:01.740> dropped<00:03:02.430> the

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:02.550 
so I know it's too rich so I dropped the

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:06.110 
so I know it's too rich so I dropped the
needles<00:03:02.880> one<00:03:03.290> clip<00:03:04.290> and<00:03:04.590> gosh<00:03:05.220> ran<00:03:05.820> a<00:03:05.850> lot

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:06.120 
needles one clip and gosh ran a lot

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:11.030 
needles one clip and gosh ran a lot
better<00:03:06.560> so<00:03:07.560> I<00:03:07.950> thought<00:03:08.310> you<00:03:08.610> know<00:03:08.700> what<00:03:10.040> what

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:11.040 
better so I thought you know what what

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:12.890 
better so I thought you know what what
if<00:03:11.160> I<00:03:11.280> can<00:03:11.430> go<00:03:11.550> one<00:03:11.850> more<00:03:12.120> that<00:03:12.540> would<00:03:12.690> mean

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:12.900 
if I can go one more that would mean

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:14.479 
if I can go one more that would mean
that<00:03:12.930> I<00:03:13.170> would<00:03:13.290> drop<00:03:13.650> the<00:03:13.860> needles<00:03:14.190> down<00:03:14.340> at

00:03:14.479 --> 00:03:14.489 
that I would drop the needles down at

00:03:14.489 --> 00:03:16.729 
that I would drop the needles down at
the<00:03:14.550> very<00:03:14.850> lowest<00:03:15.120> setting<00:03:15.750> and<00:03:15.959> you<00:03:16.650> know

00:03:16.729 --> 00:03:16.739 
the very lowest setting and you know

00:03:16.739 --> 00:03:17.990 
the very lowest setting and you know
it's<00:03:16.860> pretty<00:03:17.010> rare<00:03:17.310> that<00:03:17.340> you<00:03:17.610> have<00:03:17.700> to<00:03:17.820> do

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:18.000 
it's pretty rare that you have to do

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.920 
it's pretty rare that you have to do
that<00:03:18.209> but<00:03:18.660> I<00:03:19.230> did<00:03:19.830> it<00:03:20.070> and<00:03:20.370> now<00:03:20.640> the<00:03:20.700> low<00:03:21.090> end<00:03:21.360> is

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:21.930 
that but I did it and now the low end is

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:24.380 
that but I did it and now the low end is
great<00:03:22.470> on<00:03:22.650> this<00:03:22.800> bike<00:03:23.070> now<00:03:23.310> it's<00:03:23.940> a<00:03:24.030> little

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:24.390 
great on this bike now it's a little

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:26.840 
great on this bike now it's a little
anemic<00:03:24.690> on<00:03:25.050> the<00:03:25.170> top<00:03:25.380> end<00:03:25.709> but<00:03:26.430> there<00:03:26.580> are<00:03:26.670> some

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:26.850 
anemic on the top end but there are some

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:29.180 
anemic on the top end but there are some
other<00:03:27.030> aftermarket<00:03:27.480> needle<00:03:28.160> assemblies<00:03:29.160> that

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:29.190 
other aftermarket needle assemblies that

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:31.640 
other aftermarket needle assemblies that
I<00:03:29.370> might<00:03:29.700> try<00:03:30.000> they<00:03:30.840> have<00:03:30.989> a<00:03:31.019> little<00:03:31.380> bit

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:31.650 
I might try they have a little bit

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:34.580 
I might try they have a little bit
richer<00:03:32.250> top-end<00:03:32.700> and<00:03:33.330> a<00:03:33.600> little<00:03:33.900> bit<00:03:34.050> leaner

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:34.590 
richer top-end and a little bit leaner

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:35.840 
richer top-end and a little bit leaner
on<00:03:34.709> the<00:03:34.890> bottom<00:03:35.250> end<00:03:35.430> which<00:03:35.580> would<00:03:35.670> work

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:35.850 
on the bottom end which would work

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:38.539 
on the bottom end which would work
really<00:03:36.090> great<00:03:36.450> for<00:03:36.660> here<00:03:36.810> in<00:03:36.900> Utah<00:03:37.230> so<00:03:37.549> we'll

00:03:38.539 --> 00:03:38.549 
really great for here in Utah so we'll

00:03:38.549 --> 00:03:41.420 
really great for here in Utah so we'll
try<00:03:38.730> that<00:03:38.790> out<00:03:38.970> but<00:03:39.890> long<00:03:40.890> story<00:03:40.920> made<00:03:41.400> short

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:41.430 
try that out but long story made short

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:45.440 
try that out but long story made short
I've<00:03:42.360> got<00:03:42.570> some<00:03:42.840> plans<00:03:43.140> to<00:03:43.350> try<00:03:43.709> to<00:03:44.239> build<00:03:45.239> this

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:45.450 
I've got some plans to try to build this

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:47.360 
I've got some plans to try to build this

nation of this bike over the next months

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:23.760 
nation of this bike over the next months
into<00:04:21.940> hopefully<00:04:22.660> a<00:04:22.690> dual<00:04:22.960> sport<00:04:23.110> bike<00:04:23.470> it's

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:23.770 
into hopefully a dual sport bike it's

00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:27.030 
into hopefully a dual sport bike it's
pretty<00:04:24.730> capable<00:04:25.240> but<00:04:25.740> I've<00:04:26.740> got<00:04:26.890> two

you raise it up a little bit help both
of<00:04:54.130> those<00:04:54.370> bikes<00:04:54.700> that's<00:04:55.000> kind<00:04:55.240> of<00:04:55.270> what<00:04:55.480> I'm

00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:55.570 
of those bikes that's kind of what I'm

00:04:55.570 --> 00:04:57.750 
of those bikes that's kind of what I'm
kind<00:04:56.170> of<00:04:56.320> comparing<00:04:56.800> this<00:04:56.920> bike<00:04:57.160> to<00:04:57.460> is<00:04:57.610> the

00:04:57.750 --> 00:04:57.760 
kind of comparing this bike to is the

00:04:57.760 --> 00:05:00.540 
kind of comparing this bike to is the
KLR<00:04:58.420> and<00:04:58.950> we'll<00:04:59.950> have<00:05:00.070> a<00:05:00.100> little<00:05:00.220> bit<00:05:00.340> more

00:05:00.540 --> 00:05:00.550 
KLR and we'll have a little bit more

00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:02.340 
KLR and we'll have a little bit more
comparison<00:05:01.180> as<00:05:01.270> we<00:05:01.360> go<00:05:01.510> along<00:05:01.630> but<00:05:01.840> a<00:05:02.140> couple

00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:02.350 
comparison as we go along but a couple

00:05:02.350 --> 00:05:04.650 
comparison as we go along but a couple
things<00:05:02.710> right<00:05:02.950> out<00:05:03.100> of<00:05:03.130> gate<00:05:03.520> that<00:05:03.880> I<00:05:04.090> really

00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:04.660 
things right out of gate that I really

00:05:04.660 --> 00:05:07.710 
things right out of gate that I really
like<00:05:04.900> one<00:05:05.290> is<00:05:05.550> saddle<00:05:06.550> height<00:05:06.730> this<00:05:07.030> is<00:05:07.240> lower

00:05:07.710 --> 00:05:07.720 
like one is saddle height this is lower

00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:10.770 
like one is saddle height this is lower
than<00:05:08.050> the<00:05:08.140> KLR<00:05:08.760> I'm<00:05:09.760> only<00:05:09.970> about<00:05:10.120> five<00:05:10.450> nine<00:05:10.750> or

00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:10.780 
than the KLR I'm only about five nine or

00:05:10.780 --> 00:05:13.440 
than the KLR I'm only about five nine or
so<00:05:11.200> and<00:05:11.500> so<00:05:12.310> it's<00:05:12.520> really<00:05:12.670> nice<00:05:12.940> for<00:05:13.000> me<00:05:13.300> to<00:05:13.390> be

00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:13.450 
so and so it's really nice for me to be

00:05:13.450 --> 00:05:14.940 
so and so it's really nice for me to be
able<00:05:13.540> to<00:05:13.660> get<00:05:13.750> my<00:05:13.870> feet<00:05:14.110> down<00:05:14.380> on<00:05:14.560> the<00:05:14.680> ground

00:05:14.940 --> 00:05:14.950 
able to get my feet down on the ground

00:05:14.950 --> 00:05:16.620 
able to get my feet down on the ground
and<00:05:15.340> maneuver<00:05:15.820> some<00:05:16.060> of<00:05:16.120> the<00:05:16.210> trails<00:05:16.450> around

00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:16.630 
and maneuver some of the trails around

00:05:16.630 --> 00:05:19.260 
and maneuver some of the trails around
here<00:05:17.140> and<00:05:17.320> that's<00:05:17.770> a<00:05:17.920> nice<00:05:18.100> feature<00:05:18.370> the

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:19.270 
here and that's a nice feature the

00:05:19.270 --> 00:05:21.300 
here and that's a nice feature the
second<00:05:19.720> thing<00:05:19.900> is<00:05:20.140> this<00:05:20.260> bike<00:05:20.530> I'll<00:05:21.100> take

00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:21.310 
second thing is this bike I'll take

00:05:21.310 --> 00:05:23.100 
second thing is this bike I'll take
pictures<00:05:21.490> later<00:05:21.940> but<00:05:22.270> it's<00:05:22.510> quite<00:05:22.900> a<00:05:22.930> bit

00:05:23.100 --> 00:05:23.110 
pictures later but it's quite a bit

00:05:23.110 --> 00:05:25.860 
pictures later but it's quite a bit
narrower<00:05:23.590> than<00:05:23.860> a<00:05:23.920> KLR<00:05:24.490> and<00:05:24.760> it's<00:05:25.330> a<00:05:25.420> very

00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:25.870 
narrower than a KLR and it's a very

00:05:25.870 --> 00:05:29.130 
narrower than a KLR and it's a very
nimble<00:05:26.170> it's<00:05:26.620> very<00:05:27.370> nicely<00:05:28.180> built<00:05:28.510> bike<00:05:28.780> it's

00:05:29.130 --> 00:05:29.140 
nimble it's very nicely built bike it's

00:05:29.140 --> 00:05:32.670 
nimble it's very nicely built bike it's
got<00:05:29.350> a<00:05:29.380> real<00:05:29.620> tax<00:05:29.860> motor<00:05:30.220> and<00:05:31.050> pretty<00:05:32.050> reliable

00:05:32.670 --> 00:05:32.680 
got a real tax motor and pretty reliable

00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:34.290 
got a real tax motor and pretty reliable
they<00:05:32.860> say<00:05:33.070> as<00:05:33.310> long<00:05:33.430> as<00:05:33.490> you<00:05:33.580> take<00:05:33.760> care<00:05:34.060> of<00:05:34.180> it

00:05:34.290 --> 00:05:34.300 
they say as long as you take care of it

00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:37.650 
they say as long as you take care of it
so<00:05:34.510> where<00:05:35.410> I<00:05:35.440> see<00:05:35.650> how<00:05:35.740> that<00:05:35.950> goes<00:05:36.160> and<00:05:36.660> the

00:05:37.650 --> 00:05:37.660 
so where I see how that goes and the

00:05:37.660 --> 00:05:40.050 
so where I see how that goes and the
only<00:05:37.870> other<00:05:38.500> thing<00:05:38.740> I<00:05:38.860> need<00:05:39.130> to<00:05:39.220> mention<00:05:39.400> is<00:05:39.760> I

00:05:40.050 --> 00:05:40.060 
only other thing I need to mention is I

00:05:40.060 --> 00:05:42.780 
only other thing I need to mention is I
decided<00:05:40.510> to<00:05:40.660> change<00:05:40.930> the<00:05:41.290> rear<00:05:41.500> chain<00:05:41.860> I<00:05:42.130> put

00:05:42.780 --> 00:05:42.790 
decided to change the rear chain I put

00:05:42.790 --> 00:05:47.670 
decided to change the rear chain I put
an<00:05:42.880> o-ring<00:05:43.350> chain<00:05:44.350> on<00:05:44.590> it<00:05:44.710> a<00:05:44.770> 520<00:05:45.490> and<00:05:46.650> so<00:05:47.650> I

00:05:47.670 --> 00:05:47.680 
an o-ring chain on it a 520 and so I

00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:49.290 
an o-ring chain on it a 520 and so I
guess<00:05:47.980> that's<00:05:48.190> about<00:05:48.310> another<00:05:48.520> 80<00:05:48.790> bucks<00:05:49.090> I

00:05:49.290 --> 00:05:49.300 
guess that's about another 80 bucks I

00:05:49.300 --> 00:05:51.120 
guess that's about another 80 bucks I
fail<00:05:49.510> to<00:05:49.660> mention<00:05:49.780> that<00:05:50.170> but<00:05:50.530> the<00:05:50.770> other<00:05:50.950> one's

00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:51.130 
fail to mention that but the other one's

00:05:51.130 --> 00:05:52.710 
fail to mention that but the other one's
pretty<00:05:51.370> corroded<00:05:51.580> but<00:05:51.940> still<00:05:52.210> working<00:05:52.390> fine

00:05:52.710 --> 00:05:52.720 
pretty corroded but still working fine

00:05:52.720 --> 00:05:55.590 
pretty corroded but still working fine
it<00:05:52.930> was<00:05:53.050> an<00:05:53.200> o-ring<00:05:53.320> chain<00:05:53.800> but<00:05:54.360> it's<00:05:55.360> kind<00:05:55.540> of

00:05:55.590 --> 00:05:55.600 
it was an o-ring chain but it's kind of

00:05:55.600 --> 00:05:58.800 
it was an o-ring chain but it's kind of
dirty<00:05:55.780> too<00:05:56.080> and<00:05:56.290> right<00:05:56.500> here<00:05:56.890> last<00:05:57.640> week<00:05:57.910> on<00:05:58.480> it

00:05:58.800 --> 00:05:58.810 
dirty too and right here last week on it
