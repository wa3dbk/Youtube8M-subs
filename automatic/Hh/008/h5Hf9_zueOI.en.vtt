00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:05.550
 and 

00:00:13.210 --> 00:00:18.500
 very good to tea that we are in a new 

00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:19.640
 video from minecraft to teach them the 

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:22.279
 new things that after my version 

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:23.840
 crack 1.6 points that came out I think today 

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:25.430
 in the morning was to look at the web because 

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:27.770
 I went in and I think that in the launcher 

00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:31.400
 new that they launched already and was the 

00:00:27.770 --> 00:00:33.559
 version 1.6 points I said one less time 

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:35.360
 and of the things is not that it brought no longer and 

00:00:33.559 --> 00:00:37.879
 the new things that the 1.6 point brought 

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:39.729
 1 so I do not know if they are the same good 

00:00:37.879 --> 00:00:42.739
 let's start with the blocks already 

00:00:39.729 --> 00:00:43.400
 good first the coal the block of 

00:00:42.739 --> 00:00:46.729
 carbon 

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:48.909
 well here I have the coal already removed 

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:52.190
 also charcoal with different 

00:00:48.909 --> 00:00:55.610
 aspects so to speak tsja so is 

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:57.379
 the charcoal that is different from 

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:58.610
 another because before the same was the same 

00:00:57.379 --> 00:01:00.530
 exactly the same so now what 

00:00:58.610 --> 00:01:01.400
 they will come out in a different color and with more 

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:03.229
 details 

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:04.900
 Well here's the fiddling and the 

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:07.840
 little box this I have work for 

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:10.899
 coal we are going to see it 

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:14.979
 good as you see we get this block that 

00:01:10.899 --> 00:01:17.409
 it's carbon and holds more doing the 

00:01:14.979 --> 00:01:19.299
 iron food other things that 

00:01:17.409 --> 00:01:21.210
 can do in the oven hold more and 

00:01:19.299 --> 00:01:25.950
 good that 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:28.380
 and it serves to decorate the 1.6 everything good 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:30.960
 there are new blocks as you can see here 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:33.540
 already a new block brings new blocks 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:36.530
 apart from coal that used to melt before 

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:38.570
 with clay and made blocks 

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:40.220
 the vomiting like the one we 're going to do 

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:42.860
 now 

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:47.570
 and if now we go to the oven here 

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:49.610
 let's go if we go to the oven and what 

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:51.740
 we start cooking here and we will leave 

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:56.690
 a block of a different color 

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:58.810
 with a stone we already sowed in breaking the 

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:58.810
 diet 

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:05.010
 it's pretty good also serves I do not know 

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:09.360
 something decoration let's move on to 

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:11.130
 next here in the carpets that 

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:13.110
 They are pretty pretty if they see too much 

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:14.910
 for the servers I do not know about decoration 

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:16.560
 what you want and here is kraft already 

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:19.600
 is getting this and you already have 

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:22.330
 three of carpet manuel now 

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:26.500
 put here here and you already have all three of 

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:29.890
 carpets and good now we're going towards 

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:34.300
 back because it's very nice good before 

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:35.470
 we did and like the house of 

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:37.510
 same color that this fact is what 

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:38.860
 we made the second floor and now I do not 

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:41.380
 we want the carpet then yes 

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:43.240
 we are going to finish this obviously going 

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:46.110
 to have different expressions worth 

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:50.270
 pretty good 

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:52.910
 well let's move here this serves 

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:55.580
 You can also give him pythons 

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:59.660
 that we give because there is a block and this 

00:02:55.580 --> 00:03:01.760
 they can hide and hide and here what 

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:02.840
 they gave already serves too good we're going to 

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:04.140
 take it out now because I need to explain 

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:06.050
 something 

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:08.900
 good 

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:10.700
 this is not normal it is quite different 

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:13.510
 because if you put something here you can not 

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:14.960
 place a bug 

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:17.690
 book 

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:20.480
 this could not be placed in the same way 

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:24.460
 that now looks good 

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:27.760
 there he has it 

00:03:24.460 --> 00:03:30.250
 can not be placed here there already 

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:33.640
 would place next in exchange with a 

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:39.360
 normal block can next we're going to 

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:39.360
 see it already and here not 

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:49.780
 and good here in the automatic good this 

00:03:48.189 --> 00:03:52.510
 this is a double action also that I 

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:55.989
 he has liked enough already you are of food 

00:03:52.510 --> 00:04:01.319
 for them what horse since if 

00:03:55.989 --> 00:04:03.450
 you can see you can take the floor and 

00:04:01.319 --> 00:04:04.629
 once I have them easy enough 

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:07.090
 OK 

00:04:04.629 --> 00:04:09.489
 I'm going to put something like that and vice and 

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:11.349
 we have the block we already give it to 

00:04:09.489 --> 00:04:12.909
 horse to the burrito to any of the 

00:04:11.349 --> 00:04:15.730
 two we go we put it there they start to 

00:04:12.909 --> 00:04:19.150
 eat now to feed a horse take 

00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:24.060
 what's good to feed him with apple wheat 

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:24.060
 gilt is not normal or sugar and she 

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:30.690
 it's creative so we're going to put it in 

00:04:28.290 --> 00:04:34.440
 survivor that survival does not do this 

00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:34.440
 I already know 

00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:44.430
 in case of withdrawal case let's go 

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:44.430
 is feeding and now 

00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:53.400
 now we are not good anymore in our 

00:04:48.420 --> 00:04:53.400
 heart and our good now 

00:04:56.130 --> 00:05:00.790
 how to guide a horse we are going to put it 

00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:03.430
 creative and we're going to move on to next 

00:05:00.790 --> 00:05:05.350
 a horse can be tied a post of 

00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:06.850
 way with a rope that is here is 

00:05:05.350 --> 00:05:10.000
 pretty cool, come on, 

00:05:06.850 --> 00:05:13.310
 cord and we will come 

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:16.280
 come now 

00:05:13.310 --> 00:05:18.320
 is going to take anywhere that it takes 

00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:23.050
 only with horses and simply 

00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:23.050
 is going to be with him is going to do with a 

00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:33.660
 we are also going wind much easier 

00:05:30.040 --> 00:05:33.660
 take the coats before you could not 

00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:40.400
 the rope is made of it quite easy 

00:05:37.900 --> 00:05:43.759
 with rope 

00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:46.580
 and the rope we are going to see it here 

00:05:43.759 --> 00:05:49.789
 over here and we already have two good ones and 

00:05:46.580 --> 00:05:52.039
 are like me and can not mark your 

00:05:49.789 --> 00:05:55.610
 themselves doing the right click and 

00:05:52.039 --> 00:05:58.009
 putting him on the front armor 

00:05:55.610 --> 00:06:00.390
 mature and there it will last longer I do not know 

00:05:58.009 --> 00:06:03.930
 right now in the lips 

00:06:00.390 --> 00:06:09.390
 well that impulse bar that gives the 

00:06:03.930 --> 00:06:13.170
 Jump as fast from one place 

00:06:09.390 --> 00:06:15.600
 a life is left or is not another place what 

00:06:13.170 --> 00:06:17.790
 achieved with chip already and the last thing that 

00:06:15.600 --> 00:06:20.670
 I want to apply is the thing of the two 

00:06:17.790 --> 00:06:23.180
 pretty weird villagers and I have also 

00:06:20.670 --> 00:06:23.180
 now like 

00:06:26.270 --> 00:06:29.920
 and listen to the sound of what someone 

00:06:30.840 --> 00:06:33.380
 peace 

00:06:38.990 --> 00:06:43.480
 but I think that was all about this 

00:06:40.970 --> 00:06:43.480
 version 

00:06:44.050 --> 00:06:48.110
 and if you do not subscribe we do not see until the 

00:06:47.480 --> 00:06:50.320
 next 

00:06:48.110 --> 00:06:50.320
 goodbye
