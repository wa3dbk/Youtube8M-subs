00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:09.660
 Hello everyone for the test with 8 today 

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:10.770
 I decided to try a mousse with 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:12.690
 chocolate 

00:00:10.770 --> 00:00:14.699
 who hasn't used it all of you 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:16.860
 that you have tried make it of various 

00:00:14.699 --> 00:00:17.970
 brands and today I'm going to see that one there 

00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:19.740
 of the cameo 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:22.170
 I decided to take this because I 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:24.150
 I usually played mousse al 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:26.400
 cameo chocolate and up until now me 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:29.430
 I am always found well but this one is here 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:29.970
 the new great recipe there are new 

00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:33.379
 recipes 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:36.120
 I'm always afraid they ruin the product 

00:00:33.379 --> 00:00:36.510
 or in reality it has not changed 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:38.820
 much 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:42.540
 now let's go and see though 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:44.790
 compared to the old there are at least on 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:47.310
 cover in small nuggets of 

00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:49.110
 chocolate that should make it all 

00:00:47.310 --> 00:00:51.149
 more flavorful 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:53.730
 we see a little ingredient in his 

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:56.700
 inside as always I remind you I will 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:59.130
 I read you the rating ingredients e 

00:00:56.700 --> 00:01:01.250
 precisely inside we find the 

00:00:59.130 --> 00:01:03.769
 chocolate powder to 60 percent 

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:07.409
 10 percent chocolate nuggets 

00:01:03.769 --> 00:01:10.709
 low-fat cocoa edible syrup jelly 

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:13.399
 glucose vegetable fats which you of 

00:01:10.709 --> 00:01:15.659
 Usually companies that roar them the clue, however, 

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:16.969
 all in all it does not seem to me until now 

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:21.359
 to have read particularly increases 

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:24.539
 bad then be mono and latex 

00:01:21.359 --> 00:01:29.039
 cocoa fatty acid diglycerides 

00:01:24.539 --> 00:01:33.060
 milk proteins and then carla g min e 

00:01:29.039 --> 00:01:36.179
 guler gum and dextrose fine center 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:38.009
 there are always won for him I do not 

00:01:36.179 --> 00:01:38.609
 I express about it are not good at 

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:41.299
 these things 

00:01:38.609 --> 00:01:43.780
 give me a vote to prepare it is 

00:01:41.299 --> 00:01:45.340
 very simple and probably the reason 

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:47.500
 so everyone when we have 

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:49.510
 to make a cured essay we use prepared 

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:51.670
 and indeed within it 

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:53.500
 just reach out of the 

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:56.380
 cold milk and let's just see 

00:01:53.500 --> 00:02:00.550
 the preparation as per instructions I go 

00:01:56.380 --> 00:02:03.220
 to pour 100 75 ml of whole milk 

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:06.310
 how much the contents of the envelope that 

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:10.660
 serves for four portions of cost per 

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:13.510
 chocolate then down and I do 

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:15.820
 mix for you but at low speed e 

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:18.130
 then after all have been amalgamated 

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:21.130
 the ingredients for three minutes a 

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:25.060
 maximum speed in such a way as to 

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:27.519
 mount it this way after making it count 

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:29.470
 for three minutes I have to say he has a 

00:02:27.519 --> 00:02:33.010
 great of hours is really a beautiful aspect 

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:35.950
 a bit like whipped cream to go to 

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:39.239
 fill in the cups were that is 

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:41.980
 beautiful if that how ever I drive 

00:02:39.239 --> 00:02:44.470
 I will use a bag if it were a little 

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:46.750
 craft and there is a sachet of 

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:49.030
 you can of course also plastic 

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:51.130
 put it inside with a spoon 

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:54.120
 as you prefer I do so in a manner 

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:59.200
 such as to be able to distribute it medium 

00:02:54.120 --> 00:03:06.030
 net then the cream inside the 

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:06.030
 mine is capable of craftsmanship and I go 

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:22.030
 to press everything then I go to arrange 

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:24.670
 within my forced after 

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:28.540
 have it answered 

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:30.510
 you will have to put it in the fridge for 2 hours e 

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:33.390
 let it rest 

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:34.750
 then you can safely 

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:36.760
 serve 

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:39.750
 the two hours have passed and here is the 

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:43.270
 my chocolate move ready to be 

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:47.760
 tested and tested as you see has a 

00:03:43.270 --> 00:03:49.780
 very subdued appearance is still beautiful 

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:57.190
 frothy 

00:03:49.780 --> 00:04:01.120
 now I'm going to taste it first 

00:03:57.190 --> 00:04:02.920
 what I have to say that the bits of 

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:04.840
 chocolate inside feel 

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:07.510
 I'm really glad about this because 

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:10.360
 I had some doubts then 

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:14.470
 let's summarize all the votes a bit 

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:17.919
 first, I have quality price 

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:19.959
 paid 2 euros and 49 in a supermarket 

00:04:17.919 --> 00:04:22.419
 let me know if you can find one 

00:04:19.959 --> 00:04:25.510
 even lower price than everything 

00:04:22.419 --> 00:04:28.180
 added up as there are also 100 75 

00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:30.490
 ml of milk to add to the cost is not 

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:32.230
 a very expensive price since this 

00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:35.110
 however, four portions come out 

00:04:32.230 --> 00:04:37.540
 so it's a more than acceptable price 

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:40.030
 so in my opinion a very good quality 

00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:41.440
 price especially that you prepare in 

00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:44.590
 very short time 

00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:48.280
 the quality is good so I would give at least 

00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:51.340
 a 9 for what concerns the appearance a 

00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:54.820
 that is, an excellent aspect of a Russian 

00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:56.440
 beautiful bride so even here I would give a 

00:04:54.820 --> 00:04:57.960
 good grade 9 

00:04:56.440 --> 00:05:00.210
 especially because they had 

00:04:57.960 --> 00:05:03.210
 assistance such as cream is 

00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:05.100
 simple to dose just precisely with 

00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:07.139
 saccÃ  porsche and you can safely 

00:05:05.100 --> 00:05:08.699
 while inside your cups 

00:05:07.139 --> 00:05:10.910
 with the shape you prefer then 

00:05:08.699 --> 00:05:15.300
 I was very satisfied 

00:05:10.910 --> 00:05:18.449
 but now we come to the flavor 

00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:20.639
 taste I have to say maybe it's one of the 

00:05:18.449 --> 00:05:22.380
 better than the ready-made products I have 

00:05:20.639 --> 00:05:24.539
 tried so far because he has me 

00:05:22.380 --> 00:05:27.060
 really satisfied i found the 

00:05:24.539 --> 00:05:30.570
 pieces of chocolate inside for 

00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:32.669
 more knows just a little chocolate 

00:05:30.570 --> 00:05:35.789
 dark I have to say I prefer more 

00:05:32.669 --> 00:05:38.789
 colored but still great so a 9 

00:05:35.789 --> 00:05:42.210
 and half really very very good e 

00:05:38.789 --> 00:05:45.000
 finally the preparation time also 

00:05:42.210 --> 00:05:46.710
 I would give it a 9 I don't give a 10 right 

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:49.169
 because there is unfortunately to lose the two 

00:05:46.710 --> 00:05:51.750
 hours of refrigerator but those do not 

00:05:49.169 --> 00:05:54.090
 we can do without but really yes 

00:05:51.750 --> 00:05:54.720
 prepare in three minutes then very fast 

00:05:54.090 --> 00:05:58.050
 to prepare 

00:05:54.720 --> 00:06:01.020
 in short, my general vote for the 

00:05:58.050 --> 00:06:02.820
 Cutting chocolate mousse is a 

00:06:01.020 --> 00:06:04.889
 vote you can do the highest that 

00:06:02.820 --> 00:06:06.960
 so much for cadore because a good 9 and a half 

00:06:04.889 --> 00:06:09.750
 I was very satisfied with this 

00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:11.669
 product I do n't give more because like i 

00:06:09.750 --> 00:06:13.740
 I said I'm not an expert on 

00:06:11.669 --> 00:06:16.770
 ingredients and there you have to help me a little 

00:06:13.740 --> 00:06:19.199
 either because i don't know if inside there 

00:06:16.770 --> 00:06:21.240
 they are ingredients that are naughty 

00:06:19.199 --> 00:06:22.800
 as you say 

00:06:21.240 --> 00:06:25.590
 I hope this videorecensione is me 

00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:27.509
 useful do not miss the next if you 

00:06:25.590 --> 00:06:28.440

00:06:27.509 --> 00:06:30.180
 every Saturday 

00:06:28.440 --> 00:06:33.240
