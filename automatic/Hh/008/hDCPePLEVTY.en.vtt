this<00:03:53.209> is<00:03:53.269> the<00:03:53.480> one<00:03:53.780> I<00:03:53.810> have<00:03:53.989> here<00:03:54.019> the<00:03:54.410> little

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:55.130 
this is the one I have here the little

00:03:55.130 --> 00:03:57.240 
this is the one I have here the little
the<00:03:55.640> older<00:03:56.000> brother

00:03:57.240 --> 00:03:57.250 
the older brother

00:03:57.250 --> 00:03:59.350 
the older brother
it's<00:03:58.250> metal<00:03:58.610> and<00:03:58.670> this<00:03:58.850> the<00:03:59.030> rest<00:03:59.180> of<00:03:59.239> it's

00:03:59.350 --> 00:03:59.360 
it's metal and this the rest of it's

00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:01.630 
it's metal and this the rest of it's
possible<00:03:59.480> it<00:03:59.900> up<00:04:00.019> this<00:04:00.590> is<00:04:00.739> entirely<00:04:01.160> plastic

00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:01.640 
possible it up this is entirely plastic

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:04.960 
possible it up this is entirely plastic
but<00:04:02.120> I<00:04:02.209> guess<00:04:02.390> that's<00:04:02.630> okay<00:04:03.610> nice<00:04:04.610> cleared

00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:04.970 
but I guess that's okay nice cleared

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:07.000 
but I guess that's okay nice cleared
fantatic<00:04:05.420> blue<00:04:05.600> blue<00:04:05.870> just<00:04:06.049> like<00:04:06.140> the<00:04:06.380> brother

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:07.010 
fantatic blue blue just like the brother

00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:09.640 
fantatic blue blue just like the brother
so<00:04:08.000> two<00:04:08.360> USB<00:04:08.660> ports<00:04:08.959> so<00:04:08.989> it<00:04:09.049> means<00:04:09.260> one-year

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:09.650 
so two USB ports so it means one-year

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:11.350 
so two USB ports so it means one-year
seaport<00:04:10.040> it's<00:04:10.130> gonna<00:04:10.220> plug<00:04:10.459> onto<00:04:10.670> this<00:04:10.910> cable

00:04:11.350 --> 00:04:11.360 
seaport it's gonna plug onto this cable

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:13.780 
seaport it's gonna plug onto this cable
so<00:04:11.480> it's<00:04:11.600> gonna<00:04:11.720> go<00:04:11.870> in<00:04:11.959> like<00:04:12.110> this<00:04:12.230> and<00:04:12.790> this

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:13.790 
so it's gonna go in like this and this

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:14.979 
so it's gonna go in like this and this
sides<00:04:14.000> gonna<00:04:14.120> go<00:04:14.329> into<00:04:14.510> your<00:04:14.600> computer<00:04:14.720> or

00:04:14.979 --> 00:04:14.989 
sides gonna go into your computer or

00:04:14.989 --> 00:04:17.560 
sides gonna go into your computer or
whatever<00:04:15.320> and<00:04:15.760> then<00:04:16.760> the<00:04:16.880> other<00:04:17.000> point<00:04:17.209> is<00:04:17.419> to

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:17.570 
whatever and then the other point is to

00:04:17.570 --> 00:04:19.090 
whatever and then the other point is to
used<00:04:17.750> up<00:04:17.930> that<00:04:18.049> port<00:04:18.350> so<00:04:18.470> that<00:04:18.620> instead<00:04:19.040> of

00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:19.100 
used up that port so that instead of

00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:21.759 
used up that port so that instead of
just<00:04:19.329> wasting<00:04:20.329> one<00:04:20.479> port<00:04:20.750> for<00:04:20.930> just<00:04:21.109> power<00:04:21.320> you

00:04:21.759 --> 00:04:21.769 
just wasting one port for just power you

00:04:21.769 --> 00:04:22.690 
just wasting one port for just power you
can<00:04:21.919> still<00:04:22.130> use<00:04:22.220> it<00:04:22.340> to<00:04:22.400> connect<00:04:22.640> another

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:22.700 
can still use it to connect another

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:25.780 
can still use it to connect another
device<00:04:23.120> and<00:04:24.010> that<00:04:25.010> concludes<00:04:25.340> our<00:04:25.520> unboxing
