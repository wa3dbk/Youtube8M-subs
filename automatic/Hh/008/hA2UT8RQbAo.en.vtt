00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:06.720
 396 m long, 53 meters wide 

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:09.500
 here is the jules verne the biggest door 

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:09.500
 containers of the world 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:16.770
 transported in these huge call the tower 

00:00:13.540 --> 00:00:19.330
 eiffel or five airbus a380 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:20.250
 boarding the Red Sea aboard 

00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:24.010
 this giant of the seas 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:25.660
 from here you have to climb 50 meters 

00:00:24.010 --> 00:00:27.970
 to get to the top of the boat 

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:30.330
 the equivalent of a building of almost 20 

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:30.330
 floors 

00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:34.360
 the highest point is what we 

00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:38.170
 call the bridge a breathtaking view 

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:41.410
 but especially the commander's post this 

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:43.030
 morning he is concerned because the boat 

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:45.040
 party a month ago of heavy and 

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:48.989
 for the first time in a 

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:51.610
 mythical passage the channel of suez 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:54.430
 you have seen the bench that it raises 

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:58.180
 dirty has reduced visibility to one has a 

00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:59.860
 little more than a mile no it's not risky 

00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:03.610
 but these demands for attention 

00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:05.500
 why not go away from when 

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:07.299
 sails in the middle of the desert no 

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:10.000
 trajectory error is allowed 

00:01:07.299 --> 00:01:12.460
 a gap of only 20 meters and the 

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:14.980
 boat runs aground is a permanent danger 

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:18.100
 for this ship that needs three 

00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:19.600
 kilometers to stop and the crew 

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:21.310
 is all the more cautious as the stakes 

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:23.410
 economic is huge 

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:25.590
 the boat carries about a half 

00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:27.180
 billion euros of goods 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:29.710
 mainly manufactured goods 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:31.170
 exported from asia to europe have made 

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:32.460
 come hi fi material 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:35.250
 a big consumption of clothes 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:37.110
 visitors for example and also 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:38.340
 industrial goods for production in 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:39.360
 Europe 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:41.040
 in a few months 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:42.300
 everywhere rhin shanghai in the 

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:44.670
 different Chinese ports but also in 

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:46.610
 Malaysia a cargo of which the major 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:49.500
 part is invisible from the outside 

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:52.380
 to find it you have to go under the 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:53.940
 water level then we are in 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:54.300
 a wedge inside the hull of the 

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:56.520
 ship 

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:57.750
 it's really gigantic we can 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:58.710
 load eleven container authors 

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:01.260
 count to see them so the colors 

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:04.020
 of 11 floors plus nine more floors in 

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:06.570
 surface in total sixteen thousand containers 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:08.810
 a gigantic boat because it was 

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:11.430
 commissioned in 2007 before the crisis 

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:13.560
 since international exchanges have 

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:15.450
 experienced a serious braking but the 

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:18.120
 owner of the boat says there 

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:20.640
 find with this ship he carries 

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:22.320
 more goods spend as much 

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:24.840
 fuel oil only for a smaller boat 

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:26.760
 for a ride that represents everything from 

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:29.040
 even nine thousand tons of fuel 

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:31.880
 about 250 full miles for a 

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:34.770
 car all at a steady speed 

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:37.980
 the boat is currently advancing to 24 

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:39.440
 knots is almost 45 km to reach 

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:41.480
 this speed 

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:42.500
 read about a hundred 

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:44.930
 turns every minute 

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:48.350
 and to turn this propeller a 

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:51.400
 a standard diesel engine too 

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:53.600
 powerful than 1100 car 

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:55.400
 there is also this power station 

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:58.160
 which could satisfy the needs 

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:59.930
 of a city of 16 thousand inhabitants but 

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:03.350
 how much are they working in this 

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:06.560
 floating plant only 28 8 french 

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:08.480
 and 20 Filipino two groups that 

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:10.040
 take their dinner separately and who 

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:10.760
 occupy their tents very 

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:12.920
 different 

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:16.340
 the French return quickly to their 

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:20.630
 cabins with the bedroom a little 

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:23.030
 more personal affairs and a 

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:24.860
 toilet cubicle they never pass 

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:27.110
 more than three consecutive months at sea 

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:28.100
 for Filipinos this can go 

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:29.960
 up to nine months 

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:36.230
 so you have to recreate a home 

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:37.820

 how much can it go up to 1500 euros 

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:49.580
 it's a lot for the philippines 

00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:53.930
 because a euro at home is already 

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:55.130
 huge a job that also leaves them 

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:56.600
 full of tone for their activities

 unload and reload 1400 containers 

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:21.650
 the Jules verne will then continue 

00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:24.350
 route to northern europe before 

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:28.790
 go back to Asia a rotation he 

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:31.600
 will perform four times a year a
