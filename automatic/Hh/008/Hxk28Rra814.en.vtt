00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:22.799 
up over to a different too and you know

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:25.249 
up over to a different too and you know
just<00:01:22.880> roll<00:01:23.880> this<00:01:24.000> up<00:01:24.180> smaller<00:01:24.570> just<00:01:25.080> one

00:01:25.249 --> 00:01:25.259 
just roll this up smaller just one

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:27.710 
just roll this up smaller just one
little<00:01:25.470> bit<00:01:25.770> smaller<00:01:26.009> they<00:01:26.759> just<00:01:26.970> open<00:01:27.479> it<00:01:27.509> let

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720 
little bit smaller they just open it let

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:30.020 
little bit smaller they just open it let
it<00:01:27.750> go<00:01:27.930> it<00:01:28.200> expands<00:01:29.159> inside<00:01:29.490> this<00:01:29.640> tube<00:01:29.850> and

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
it go it expands inside this tube and

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:31.969 
it go it expands inside this tube and
then<00:01:30.090> tape<00:01:30.329> it<00:01:30.360> and<00:01:30.659> take<00:01:31.409> it<00:01:31.439> out<00:01:31.560> of<00:01:31.619> tape<00:01:31.829> it

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979 
then tape it and take it out of tape it

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:35.780 
then tape it and take it out of tape it
so<00:01:32.250> the<00:01:32.640> dots<00:01:32.880> just<00:01:33.270> take<00:01:33.450> a<00:01:33.479> nail<00:01:33.720> and<00:01:34.790> force

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:35.790 
so the dots just take a nail and force

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:38.390 
so the dots just take a nail and force
you<00:01:35.970> roll<00:01:36.810> this<00:01:36.990> around<00:01:37.110> here<00:01:37.409> over<00:01:37.619> first

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400 
you roll this around here over first

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:42.310 
you roll this around here over first
roll<00:01:38.579> like<00:01:38.790> a<00:01:38.820> paper<00:01:39.350> blowgun<00:01:40.350> dart<00:01:40.590> a<00:01:40.860> railgun

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:42.320 
roll like a paper blowgun dart a railgun

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:46.160 
roll like a paper blowgun dart a railgun
dart<00:01:43.320> and<00:01:43.530> so<00:01:44.220> just<00:01:44.369> like<00:01:44.700> this<00:01:45.180> just<00:01:45.810> roll<00:01:46.049> it

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170
