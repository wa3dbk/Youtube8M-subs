okay<00:00:07.100> here<00:00:07.340> we<00:00:07.460> have<00:00:07.640> the<00:00:07.790> modified<00:00:08.210> Lambie

00:00:08.830 --> 00:00:08.840 
okay here we have the modified Lambie

00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:10.240 
okay here we have the modified Lambie
pedal<00:00:09.290> the<00:00:09.740> first<00:00:09.980> thing<00:00:10.100> you'll<00:00:10.219> probably

00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:10.250 
pedal the first thing you'll probably

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:11.920 
pedal the first thing you'll probably
notice<00:00:10.610> is<00:00:10.879> there's<00:00:11.120> a<00:00:11.180> stomp<00:00:11.540> switch<00:00:11.750> where

00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:11.930 
notice is there's a stomp switch where

00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:13.810 
notice is there's a stomp switch where
the<00:00:12.020> ain't<00:00:12.230> used<00:00:12.440> to<00:00:12.590> be<00:00:12.740> we<00:00:13.490> look<00:00:13.639> a<00:00:13.700> little

00:00:13.810 --> 00:00:13.820 
the ain't used to be we look a little

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:15.730 
the ain't used to be we look a little
more<00:00:13.969> closely<00:00:14.240> you'll<00:00:14.510> see<00:00:14.660> there's<00:00:14.870> a<00:00:14.990> LED

00:00:15.730 --> 00:00:15.740 
more closely you'll see there's a LED

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:17.620 
more closely you'll see there's a LED
here<00:00:15.950> and<00:00:16.130> that<00:00:16.700> this<00:00:16.820> switch<00:00:17.090> is<00:00:17.270> different

00:00:17.620 --> 00:00:17.630 
here and that this switch is different

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:21.190 
here and that this switch is different
so<00:00:17.840> let's<00:00:18.020> take<00:00:18.200> a<00:00:18.230> closer<00:00:18.529> look<00:00:20.020> here<00:00:21.020> we<00:00:21.170> have

00:00:21.190 --> 00:00:21.200 
so let's take a closer look here we have

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:24.429 
so let's take a closer look here we have
the<00:00:21.439> momentary<00:00:22.009> switch<00:00:22.899> this<00:00:23.899> is<00:00:23.960> what<00:00:24.230> turns

00:00:24.429 --> 00:00:24.439 
the momentary switch this is what turns

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:26.889 
the momentary switch this is what turns
the<00:00:24.649> effect<00:00:24.950> on<00:00:25.130> for<00:00:25.399> just<00:00:25.579> a<00:00:25.640> second<00:00:26.029> here<00:00:26.720> it

00:00:26.889 --> 00:00:26.899 
the effect on for just a second here it

00:00:26.899 --> 00:00:29.319 
the effect on for just a second here it
is<00:00:27.050> the<00:00:27.410> true<00:00:27.649> bypass<00:00:28.070> switch<00:00:28.250> with<00:00:29.149> its

00:00:29.319 --> 00:00:29.329 
is the true bypass switch with its

00:00:29.329 --> 00:00:32.049 
is the true bypass switch with its
accompanying<00:00:29.779> LED<00:00:30.230> I<00:00:30.470> also<00:00:31.070> relocated<00:00:31.910> the

00:00:32.049 --> 00:00:32.059 
accompanying LED I also relocated the

00:00:32.059 --> 00:00:33.850 
accompanying LED I also relocated the
original<00:00:32.720> momentary<00:00:33.230> so<00:00:33.350> you<00:00:33.410> can<00:00:33.530> put<00:00:33.710> it<00:00:33.800> on

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:33.860 
original momentary so you can put it on

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:35.860 
original momentary so you can put it on
the<00:00:34.010> back<00:00:34.220> so<00:00:34.820> you<00:00:34.880> can<00:00:35.030> still<00:00:35.239> calibrate<00:00:35.750> the

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:35.870 
the back so you can still calibrate the

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:46.479 
the back so you can still calibrate the
pedal<00:00:40.420> so<00:00:41.420> that's<00:00:41.540> basically<00:00:41.990> it

00:00:46.479 --> 00:00:46.489 

00:00:46.489 --> 00:00:48.920 

here<00:00:47.489> I've<00:00:47.610> got<00:00:47.640> the<00:00:47.879> recording<00:00:48.270> setup<00:00:48.539> got<00:00:48.899> a

Suns ominously between each one of the

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:48.010 
Suns ominously between each one of the
setting<00:02:25.970> changes

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:48.020 

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:50.360 

so<00:02:49.020> just<00:02:49.200> like<00:02:49.320> with<00:02:49.440> the<00:02:49.530> two<00:02:49.680> octaves<00:02:50.070> up<00:02:50.220> we

so just like with the two octaves up we
can<00:02:50.490> jump<00:02:50.730> between<00:02:51.060> settings<00:02:51.420> now<00:02:51.900> let's<00:02:52.050> try

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:52.260 
can jump between settings now let's try

00:02:52.260 --> 00:03:03.839 
can jump between settings now let's try
a<00:02:52.290> harmony<00:02:52.710> mode<00:02:52.890> here<00:02:53.130> we<00:02:53.220> have<00:02:53.370> fifths

00:03:03.839 --> 00:03:03.849 

00:03:03.849 --> 00:03:06.420 

and<00:03:04.689> now<00:03:04.989> with<00:03:05.200> the<00:03:05.290> fifths<00:03:05.680> on<00:03:05.890> for<00:03:06.219> the<00:03:06.280> whole

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:06.430 
and now with the fifths on for the whole

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:17.820 
and now with the fifths on for the whole
duration<00:03:06.579> of<00:03:06.969> the<00:03:07.060> riff

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:17.830 

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:20.170 

now<00:03:18.830> if<00:03:18.950> I<00:03:19.010> want<00:03:19.250> I<00:03:19.370> can<00:03:19.490> bring<00:03:19.640> out<00:03:19.790> just<00:03:20.000> the

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:20.180 
now if I want I can bring out just the

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:32.949 
now if I want I can bring out just the
low<00:03:20.330> notes<00:03:20.570> of<00:03:20.720> the<00:03:20.840> riff<00:03:21.020> with<00:03:21.350> the<00:03:21.500> face

00:03:32.949 --> 00:03:32.959 

00:03:32.959 --> 00:03:48.120 

or<00:03:33.959> the<00:03:34.200> high<00:03:34.349> notes

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:48.130 

00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:50.170 

okay<00:03:49.130> now<00:03:49.250> let's<00:03:49.430> try<00:03:49.610> it<00:03:49.670> on<00:03:49.760> a<00:03:49.820> different

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:50.180 
okay now let's try it on a different

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:53.140 
okay now let's try it on a different
setting<00:03:50.390> here<00:03:50.690> we<00:03:50.840> have<00:03:51.110> the<00:03:51.530> detune<00:03:52.400> mode<00:03:52.730> set

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:53.150 
setting here we have the detune mode set

00:03:53.150 --> 00:04:05.470 
setting here we have the detune mode set
to<00:03:53.180> deep<00:04:03.370> here's<00:04:04.370> the<00:04:04.520> same<00:04:04.730> riff<00:04:05.000> but<00:04:05.300> with

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:05.480 
to deep here's the same riff but with

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:17.710 
to deep here's the same riff but with
coarse<00:04:15.400> as<00:04:16.400> you<00:04:16.609> can<00:04:16.730> hear<00:04:16.910> all<00:04:17.060> the<00:04:17.090> mutes<00:04:17.480> get

00:04:17.710 --> 00:04:17.720 
coarse as you can hear all the mutes get

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:19.390 
coarse as you can hear all the mutes get
a<00:04:17.750> little<00:04:17.989> windy<00:04:18.350> sounding<00:04:18.739> so<00:04:18.980> let's<00:04:19.160> try<00:04:19.370> it

00:04:19.390 --> 00:04:19.400 
a little windy sounding so let's try it

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:33.040 
a little windy sounding so let's try it
with<00:04:19.489> them<00:04:19.760> on<00:04:30.940> and<00:04:31.940> finally<00:04:32.660> we<00:04:32.840> have<00:04:32.960> the

00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:33.050 
with them on and finally we have the

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:34.480 
with them on and finally we have the
blend<00:04:33.350> mode<00:04:33.530> you<00:04:33.740> can<00:04:33.890> actually<00:04:34.070> do<00:04:34.340> this

00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:34.490 
blend mode you can actually do this

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:35.620 
blend mode you can actually do this
without<00:04:34.670> the<00:04:34.940> mod<00:04:35.120> at<00:04:35.270> all

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:35.630 
without the mod at all

00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:37.690 
without the mod at all
so<00:04:36.050> first<00:04:36.380> let's<00:04:36.560> hear<00:04:36.710> the<00:04:36.830> riff<00:04:37.040> with<00:04:37.490> no

00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:37.700 
so first let's hear the riff with no

00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:51.270 
so first let's hear the riff with no
whammy

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:51.280 

00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:53.160
