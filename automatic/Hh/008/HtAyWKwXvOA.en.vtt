00:00:03.890 --> 00:00:08.460
 you know I still don't understand how 

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:09.870
 make certain people to continue to 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:11.940
 look at that crap now 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:14.900
 become the television the kitchen from 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:16.920
 watch all those reality shows 

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:19.140
 TV news that remondina technically 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:21.060
 with the purpose of taking the piss out of us 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:22.410
 in order to lose everything 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:24.750
 now he does n't know what to do with Italian 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:26.970
 middle is here I open so many quotes and 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:28.859
 diminish it on the most recent country it is 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:31.050
 was that disgusting obscene service 

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:33.120
 who gave the last announcement 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:34.890
 week service shot luca resumes 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:36.960
 interviewed a cosplayer because if he did 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:39.809
 solely to give a message to me 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:41.399
 all of you who were lucca and all 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:43.620
 those that are comics manga that 

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:45.780
 the videogames play are losers 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:47.550
 and this is something I can't stand 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:49.260
 because the message was clear because I know 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:52.199
 for kids there is a big site banner 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:54.059
 site from loser to superhero the same 

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:56.489
 messages will send them in those balls of the 

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:59.219
 public from home and text message and to all 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:00.719
 messages listened to a script but second 

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:02.820
 we study more because we don't take photos 

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:04.409
 he also interviewed works that he later fucked 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:05.729
 it means I wear poker 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:08.340
 you talking about things you don't understand a 

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:09.990
 fuck if you ignorant shots bitches i 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:12.510
 managerial powers exists at its peak 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:14.460
 way a few many loans really is 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:16.200
 this is something that I can't handle 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:17.189
 because if they are more or less messages 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:19.110
 television in the new generations 

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:20.610
 various future generations 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:24.150
 let us not always be surprised we are the 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:27.060
 twelve on briaca do not take drugs yes 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:28.860
 do whores stay in town for 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:31.549
 linux plans are guys name remains 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:35.400
 in the city he can no longer do that fry 

00:01:31.549 --> 00:01:38.460
 incites to go to 16 years pregnant like this 

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:41.030
 became famous and I send photos with 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:41.030
 ge so 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:49.510
 no absolutely not we don't 

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:51.880
 thus diminishing our passions 

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:53.830
 these people here were sent to Lucca and 

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:55.660
 I did not even know where they were and I know for 

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:57.460
 safety because they stopped love me 

00:01:55.660 --> 00:01:59.140

 big brother they concern us and have us 

00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:05.800
 said but because you are dressed like that 

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:07.300
 because we are the coastal seeds of the comic 

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:09.040
 you don't even know what a cosplay is 

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:10.930
 as if something really makes me 

00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:12.700
 pissed off to solve centers that 

00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:14.290

 our city needs relatives to 

00:03:12.909 --> 00:03:18.670
 edinho when it serves this type of 

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:20.319
