00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:15.969
 so now when the whole flower is ready for 

00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:20.679
 should weigh me a yellow thread hooking 

00:00:15.969 --> 00:00:22.929
 I pass the cookie and one to the stick on 

00:00:20.679 --> 00:00:28.359
 that loop for the very middle here 

00:00:22.929 --> 00:00:29.560
 the middle I hooked and now how goes 

00:00:28.359 --> 00:00:32.310
 circle plate 

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:32.310
 spider 

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:10.880
 Spider thread in my floss in 3 

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:35.330
 addition the thicker there is not to the faster 

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:41.600
 a spider is cramming detailed technology 

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:44.570
 weaving a spider explained in another 

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:47.920
 video tutorial that is called 

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:47.920
 spider weaving 

00:01:49.540 --> 00:02:10.100
 there it is explained how to connect a string 

00:01:55.190 --> 00:02:14.989
 take what I drag the spiders nothing 

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:17.920
 poured bobbin thread falls 

00:02:14.989 --> 00:02:17.920
 smooth 

00:03:20.210 --> 00:03:30.410
 need to fill all the space here 

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:34.920
 there is a possibility 

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:37.500
 spin the spider as long as there was a place like 

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:39.090
 can be more yellow center here 

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:42.050
 there is already a closet closet 

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:42.050
 a little visible 

00:04:43.029 --> 00:04:48.969
 so here's the last time I do the grid 

00:04:46.399 --> 00:04:51.439
 the spider is ready now these two threads 

00:04:48.969 --> 00:04:52.279
 who are left from doing the spider 

00:04:51.439 --> 00:04:55.129
 need to sew up 

00:04:52.279 --> 00:04:57.110
 it is necessary to sew them in a spider because in 

00:04:55.129 --> 00:05:02.209
 linen thread can not be yellow thread 

00:04:57.110 --> 00:05:05.360
 sew up and and will be immediately visible first 

00:05:02.209 --> 00:05:09.379
 a little bit need to take this thread crochet 

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:13.669
 somewhere deep into the spider for example 

00:05:09.379 --> 00:05:14.629
 here then take me when I'm with him already 

00:05:13.669 --> 00:05:20.779
 products 

00:05:14.629 --> 00:05:25.429
 I put this thread in a needle and on 

00:05:20.779 --> 00:05:27.379
 wrong side of those and the rules on 

00:05:25.429 --> 00:05:30.469
 wrong side i 

00:05:27.379 --> 00:05:34.009
 I sew and and more reliable and while I her 

00:05:30.469 --> 00:05:37.089
 secured so that it does not bloom when 

00:05:34.009 --> 00:05:37.089
 I will remove the product 

00:06:01.250 --> 00:06:06.449
 here is a tiny flower I 

00:06:03.630 --> 00:06:09.509
 I get fragments that I'll post 

00:06:06.449 --> 00:06:12.030
 to this lesson there will be a daisy more 

00:06:09.509 --> 00:06:15.270
 the size is the same and the size is bigger 

00:06:12.030 --> 00:06:18.180
 Now I'm ready to daisy already sewed strings 

00:06:15.270 --> 00:06:21.780
 the spider from the front always looks 

00:06:18.180 --> 00:06:23.699
 prettier than the back he is such priests 

00:06:21.780 --> 00:06:26.539
 chat and sometimes get sometimes it turns out 

00:06:23.699 --> 00:06:26.539
