hi guys welcome back this is the

hi guys welcome back this is the
unboxing<00:00:08.370> of<00:00:08.880> a<00:00:09.389> new<00:00:09.690> servo<00:00:10.230> for<00:00:10.440> my<00:00:10.590> x-ray<00:00:11.040> la

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:11.550 
unboxing of a new servo for my x-ray la

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:16.820 
unboxing of a new servo for my x-ray la
electric<00:00:12.179> car<00:00:12.469> it's<00:00:13.469> the<00:00:13.679> old<00:00:13.889> turn<00:00:14.160> us<00:00:14.519> a<00:00:15.830> high

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:16.830 
electric car it's the old turn us a high

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:19.540 
electric car it's the old turn us a high
speed<00:00:17.190> servo<00:00:17.520> the<00:00:17.970> part<00:00:18.210> numbers<00:00:18.539> there<00:00:18.840> but

00:00:19.540 --> 00:00:19.550 
speed servo the part numbers there but

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:24.970 
speed servo the part numbers there but
it's<00:00:20.550> also<00:00:20.699> going<00:00:21.060> up<00:00:21.240> on<00:00:21.390> the<00:00:21.510> screen<00:00:21.750> now<00:00:21.990> and

00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:24.980 

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:27.890 

this<00:00:25.980> is<00:00:26.220> going<00:00:26.430> to<00:00:26.490> be<00:00:26.609> using<00:00:26.820> a<00:00:27.090> 1x<00:00:27.390> go<00:00:27.630> buggy

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:27.900 
this is going to be using a 1x go buggy

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:31.160 
this is going to be using a 1x go buggy
it<00:00:28.080> has<00:00:28.260> a<00:00:28.289> speed<00:00:29.160> of<00:00:29.369> 0.09<00:00:30.210> seconds<00:00:30.869> so<00:00:31.080> it

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:31.170 
it has a speed of 0.09 seconds so it

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:34.250 
it has a speed of 0.09 seconds so it
should<00:00:31.349> be<00:00:31.470> quite<00:00:32.340> fast<00:00:32.640> so<00:00:33.270> let's<00:00:33.450> just<00:00:33.630> take

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:34.260 
should be quite fast so let's just take

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:42.430 
should be quite fast so let's just take
this<00:00:34.410> out<00:00:34.620> of<00:00:34.649> its<00:00:34.890> package

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:42.440 

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:54.580 

just<00:00:42.710> get<00:00:42.829> rid<00:00:42.980> of<00:00:43.040> this<00:00:43.220> ooh

00:00:54.580 --> 00:00:54.590 

00:00:54.590 --> 00:01:07.920 

comes<00:00:55.590> in<00:00:55.770> a<00:00:55.829> nice<00:00:56.040> little<00:00:56.399> box<00:00:56.879> here

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:07.930 

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:11.100 

there's<00:01:08.530> the<00:01:08.710> server<00:01:09.270> it's<00:01:10.270> all<00:01:10.480> metal<00:01:10.690> gears

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:11.110 
there's the server it's all metal gears

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:14.490 
there's the server it's all metal gears
of<00:01:11.320> course<00:01:11.730> got<00:01:12.730> a<00:01:12.760> nice<00:01:13.000> plastic<00:01:13.540> case<00:01:14.050> but<00:01:14.410> it

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:14.500 
of course got a nice plastic case but it

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:19.320 
of course got a nice plastic case but it
seems<00:01:14.770> like<00:01:15.570> something<00:01:16.570> like<00:01:16.720> metal<00:01:17.250> in<00:01:18.330> this

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:19.330 
seems like something like metal in this

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:20.760 
seems like something like metal in this
section<00:01:19.660> down<00:01:20.140> here

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:20.770 
section down here

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:25.620 
section down here
their<00:01:21.610> logo<00:01:21.850> so<00:01:22.480> that's<00:01:23.050> nice<00:01:24.480> comes<00:01:25.480> with

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:25.630 
their logo so that's nice comes with

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:29.610 
their logo so that's nice comes with
some<00:01:26.170> foam<00:01:26.980> which<00:01:27.250> could<00:01:27.490> be<00:01:27.580> useful<00:01:28.380> and<00:01:29.380> then

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:29.620 
some foam which could be useful and then

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:32.040 
some foam which could be useful and then
obviously<00:01:29.800> all<00:01:30.130> your<00:01:30.280> hardware<00:01:30.910> server<00:01:31.720> horns

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:32.050 
obviously all your hardware server horns

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:35.190 
obviously all your hardware server horns
and<00:01:32.140> all<00:01:32.230> that<00:01:32.410> kind<00:01:32.620> of<00:01:32.680> thing<00:01:32.890> so<00:01:33.960> I'm<00:01:34.960> going

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:35.200 
and all that kind of thing so I'm going

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:37.770 
and all that kind of thing so I'm going
to<00:01:35.320> be<00:01:35.410> installing<00:01:35.800> this<00:01:36.040> into<00:01:36.430> my<00:01:36.780> x-ray

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:37.780 
to be installing this into my x-ray

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:40.950 
to be installing this into my x-ray
arrow<00:01:38.050> 80<00:01:38.440> now<00:01:39.360> so<00:01:40.360> that's<00:01:40.540> the<00:01:40.690> server

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:40.960 
arrow 80 now so that's the server

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:43.620 
arrow 80 now so that's the server
installed<00:01:41.530> into<00:01:41.800> my<00:01:41.920> car<00:01:42.160> there's<00:01:42.910> a<00:01:43.060> simple

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:43.630 
installed into my car there's a simple

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:48.300 
installed into my car there's a simple
easy<00:01:43.780> process<00:01:44.140> it<00:01:44.530> just<00:01:44.560> screwed<00:01:45.100> right<00:01:45.310> in<00:01:47.310> so

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:48.310 
easy process it just screwed right in so

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:50.160 
easy process it just screwed right in so
now<00:01:48.640> we're<00:01:48.910> going<00:01:49.000> to<00:01:49.060> do<00:01:49.240> a<00:01:49.270> bench<00:01:49.570> test<00:01:49.930> and

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:50.170 
now we're going to do a bench test and

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:53.130 
now we're going to do a bench test and
see<00:01:50.470> how<00:01:50.500> well<00:01:50.979> it<00:01:51.100> performs<00:01:51.690> okay<00:01:52.690> so<00:01:52.750> here's

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:53.140 
see how well it performs okay so here's

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:55.920 
see how well it performs okay so here's
a<00:01:53.229> bench<00:01:53.470> test<00:01:53.830> of<00:01:54.040> the<00:01:54.390> all-time<00:01:55.390> USA

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:55.930 
a bench test of the all-time USA

00:01:55.930 --> 00:02:03.600 
a bench test of the all-time USA
steering's<00:01:56.440> over<00:02:01.770> this<00:02:02.770> isn't<00:02:03.070> a<00:02:03.100> 1/8<00:02:03.430> scale

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:03.610 
steering's over this isn't a 1/8 scale

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:07.530 
steering's over this isn't a 1/8 scale
electric<00:02:04.210> baggage<00:02:05.880> so<00:02:06.880> you<00:02:06.940> can<00:02:07.119> see<00:02:07.270> it's<00:02:07.390> got

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:07.540 
electric baggage so you can see it's got

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:23.390 
electric baggage so you can see it's got
plenty<00:02:07.750> of<00:02:08.020> torque<00:02:08.350> and<00:02:09.220> plenty<00:02:09.759> of<00:02:09.790> power

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:23.400
