 Hi, my name is David Kautzký, you can know me as Thorus, and this is my story. 

00:00:21.551 --> 00:00:24.269
 I'm an ordinary boy who works on a farm and likes archery 

00:00:25.886 --> 00:00:27.229
 horseback riding and wandering with nature. 

00:00:36.763 --> 00:00:42.361
 I like to meet new cultures, new languages ​​and make new friends from around the world. 

00:00:44.644 --> 00:00:47.315
 I started playing computer games at the age of ten. 

00:00:47.315 --> 00:00:53.288
 At that time, RPGs and strategy games were popular, and the action games didn't attract me. 

00:00:53.568 --> 00:00:56.945
 When I started university, my friend tells me: 

00:00:57.403 --> 00:01:01.746
 "Hey, I have access to closed World of Tanks beta, should I get you there?" 

00:01:02.446 --> 00:01:07.618
 And I said, "Tank shooter, it could be worth it, I'll try it!" And so I started with World of Tanks. 

00:01:13.992 --> 00:01:21.039
 During beta I found out that every type of tank is something interesting and that you can play with anything and whatever you want. 

00:01:21.743 --> 00:01:25.835
 Our team has just got a new sponsor and you know us by name TCM-Gaming. 

00:01:26.328 --> 00:01:31.500
 You will see us in the offline season 4 finals. 

00:01:40.294 --> 00:01:46.514
 The most important person for me is my brother. Although he didn't play this game, he cheered me. 

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:56.342
 I'm glad he started playing now and I'm glad we can advise and improve each other. 

00:02:03.759 --> 00:02:07.011
 A lot of people ask me how I achieve such results. 

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:12.516
 It's a lot of hard work. I've been playing World of Tanks for 4 years now 

00:02:13.471 --> 00:02:18.723
 And now it's not just a game for me, it's part of my life. 

00:02:23.265 --> 00:02:27.359
 I would advise all new players to believe. Don't give up, whatever happens. 

00:02:27.434 --> 00:02:33.651
 In World of Tanks, everything is up to you and everyone can win. 

00:02:39.768 --> 00:02:40.001
 Let us battle!
