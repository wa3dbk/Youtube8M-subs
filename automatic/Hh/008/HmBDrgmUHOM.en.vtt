00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:12.660
 and who likes those super fast tips 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:16.529
 I'm going to talk about rice today and I'll make one. 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:19.320
 rice microwave people to this container 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:22.320
 is a clique of a material that 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:25.050
 accept the waves micro waves and I go 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:30.210
 put the rice 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:32.189
 I'll use your onion and garlic seasoning 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:33.510
 like what time you make 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:38.550
 better than me 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:41.250
 there's a little corn too if you 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:42.750
 like if not like replace others 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:46.530
 Ingredients 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:50.280
 I'll add a little pea 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:52.739
 and carrot and an ingredient based on 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:55.379
 a protein can be chicken can be 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:58.550
 attached together can be a sausage 

00:00:55.379 --> 00:01:02.370
 could be a shrimp-type sea fruit 

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:06.830
 goldfish just to give that flavor and go 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:10.439
 mix everything very well and not raw 

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:14.909
 I added salt because I added 

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:18.689
 the salt because the sausage already has the seasoning 

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:21.659
 it is already strong it is necessary to put the 

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:24.210
 liquid component that would be the water 

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:26.939
 You're going to cook that rice because 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:30.479
 totally raw rice this sausage is 

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:34.049
 raw humid slightly cooked plus ta 

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:37.619
 Durinho and I will always add to 

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:45.060
 each measure of raw rice two measures of 

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:48.899
 water and we 're going to play very well and then I 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:52.649
 I'll try my panela and I'll take the 

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:55.860
 this pan is proper because the 

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:58.469
 rice when it boils and bubbles 

00:01:55.860 --> 00:02:00.479
 would pour into your microwave 

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:03.509
 She has this cap where she goes. 

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:07.110
 water that has risen and when the 

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:10.970
 rice is drying it goes down this 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:14.390
 If you do not have a small 

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:17.270
 This repeat uses a refractory but has 

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:20.510
 have so much and now I'm going to lead a 

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:24.680
 micro a cup of rice 

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:27.490
 it takes about 12 minutes to 

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:27.490
 high power 

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:40.820
 spent a few minutes is 

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:43.630
 Ready our rice is always good 

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:48.170
 wait a little while he finishes drying 

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:51.950
 open with care and you will see that your 

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:55.430
 Laughter is ready. 

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:58.940
 like every good result we have to 

00:02:55.430 --> 00:03:00.890
 add a little butter and 

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:03.080
 a little grated cheese 

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:05.780
 Do you like a sour cream until you give 

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:09.320
 an improvement on the cream and then 

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:11.660
 You will put a container and go 

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:13.970
 To delight, I'll mix a little bit of 

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:15.320
 butter cheese optional cream 

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:17.239
 optional milk 

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:19.730
 just that there is a very good taste I thee 

00:03:17.239 --> 00:03:23.570
 I advise if you can put it would 

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:26.630

00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:30.320
