00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:29.530 
you go okay I can do that then you're

00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:31.559 
you go okay I can do that then you're
missing<00:04:29.889> the<00:04:30.009> whole<00:04:30.039> point<00:04:30.280> of<00:04:30.699> the<00:04:31.090> benefit

way<00:05:08.080> too<00:05:08.139> heavy<00:05:08.440> for<00:05:08.940> my<00:05:09.940> current<00:05:10.150> ability<00:05:11.370> but

00:05:12.980 --> 00:05:12.990 
way too heavy for my current ability but

00:05:12.990 --> 00:05:16.409 
way too heavy for my current ability but
by<00:05:13.990> even<00:05:14.590> training<00:05:15.009> for<00:05:15.250> it<00:05:15.400> I<00:05:15.550> got<00:05:15.879> way

00:05:16.409 --> 00:05:16.419 
by even training for it I got way

00:05:16.419 --> 00:05:18.390 
by even training for it I got way
stronger<00:05:17.020> in<00:05:17.169> that<00:05:17.319> time<00:05:17.590> period<00:05:17.889> and<00:05:18.219> learned

00:05:18.390 --> 00:05:18.400 
stronger in that time period and learned

00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:20.219 
stronger in that time period and learned
way<00:05:18.639> more<00:05:18.669> because<00:05:19.270> I<00:05:19.300> had<00:05:19.449> that<00:05:19.569> pressure<00:05:19.930> of

00:05:20.219 --> 00:05:20.229 
way more because I had that pressure of

00:05:20.229 --> 00:05:21.869 
way more because I had that pressure of
a<00:05:20.319> deadline<00:05:20.349> of<00:05:20.919> knowing<00:05:21.279> I<00:05:21.400> had<00:05:21.580> to<00:05:21.699> go

00:05:21.869 --> 00:05:21.879 
a deadline of knowing I had to go

00:05:21.879 --> 00:05:23.129 
a deadline of knowing I had to go
somewhere<00:05:22.330> and<00:05:22.449> do<00:05:22.599> something<00:05:22.629> I've<00:05:23.110> never

00:05:23.129 --> 00:05:23.139 
somewhere and do something I've never

00:05:23.139 --> 00:05:26.309 
somewhere and do something I've never
done<00:05:23.409> before<00:05:23.919> in<00:05:23.949> front<00:05:24.279> of<00:05:24.460> people<00:05:24.819> and<00:05:25.319> you
