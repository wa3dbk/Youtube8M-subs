00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:14.150
 hello to you gamer 

00:00:11.090 --> 00:00:17.210
 play toy shadow blade great 

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:20.590
 arcade platformer is very showy and 

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:22.520
 spectacular long awaited the release of this game 

00:00:20.590 --> 00:00:24.890
 I liked her 

00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:27.859
 judging by the videos and judging by the gameplay 

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:34.760
 now I just like it very much 

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:37.519
 in the management, you can assign your own 

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:39.889
 type of control, that is, whether with wipe 

00:00:37.519 --> 00:00:41.870
 in this way either by arrows 

00:00:39.889 --> 00:00:43.670
 but I like my arrows better 

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:47.659
 litter that is where the layers go there you 

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:50.420
 your character is moving it with me now 

00:00:47.659 --> 00:00:54.190
 worth the free version available and here 

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:57.229
 only seven missions let's start with 3 and 

00:00:54.190 --> 00:01:00.529
 I'll quickly go over and tell you about 

00:00:57.229 --> 00:01:02.569
 control in the game which is very so 

00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:04.759
 let's say let's say varied you can 

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:08.180
 sneak up from behind kill the enemy 

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:10.969
 can do double jump can do 

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:14.359
 jump and kick down like this 

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:17.119
 you can do the jump and kick with you 

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:20.090
 forward that there is such a breakthrough possible 

00:01:17.119 --> 00:01:23.359
 kill and kill enemies on the go 

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:25.789
 that is, at the level of this market here 

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:28.130
 gaming such a currency let's say so 

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:30.109
 which if you collect you earn 

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:32.619
 more stars well naturally too 

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:37.899
 such characters are present inside 

00:01:32.619 --> 00:01:41.119
 so he can push off the walls 

00:01:37.899 --> 00:01:42.399
 character well, in general a lot of him 

00:01:41.119 --> 00:01:45.979
 various beats 

00:01:42.399 --> 00:01:48.109
 this ninja is desirable to pick up 

00:01:45.979 --> 00:01:51.109
 Of course all the stars are not always with me 

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:53.900
 it turns out as there are levels too 

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:57.930
 here are tangled 

00:01:53.900 --> 00:02:02.009
 our hero is very effectively killed usually 

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:04.439
 all his enemies that is always on 

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:07.020
 differently that is on murder options on 

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:08.009
 I run just lie and beat that is 

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:12.510
 some 

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:15.239
 and it is very happy and very impressive 

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:18.750
 and it looks beautiful at all these toys 

00:02:15.239 --> 00:02:22.500
 don't really like it then so u with 

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:24.410
 reversal there can kill back here 

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:29.370
 time goes on 

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:31.620
 that's how you would for this time 

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:36.090
 catch the run 

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:39.690
 Of course shakes sometimes you need to think how 

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:44.489
 would think there is no time and so jump 

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:45.739
 how to kill and so on here was this 

00:02:44.489 --> 00:02:50.130
 here's the thing 

00:02:45.739 --> 00:02:56.370
 the symbol below is hidden and needed it 

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:59.630
 to pick up the graphics in revenue is also cool 

00:02:56.370 --> 00:03:02.160
 Such a cartoon is interesting but the 

00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:05.540
 The feature of this game is in the animation 

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:08.400
 all these blows all these tricks and 

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:10.109
 control variability , that is, it is possible and 

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:14.280
 wonder 

00:03:10.109 --> 00:03:25.560
 different spectacular stuff than actually 

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:26.780
 toy and takes yes it checkpoint that is 

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:33.150
 we just 

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:37.769
 beat and if suddenly we die then in 

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:40.139
 dwell on this place here and now 

00:03:37.769 --> 00:03:44.260
 such missions are not very complicated 

00:03:40.139 --> 00:03:47.110
 there were already the first thorn-shaped traps 

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:54.280
 further there will be more traps and will 

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:56.590
 even harder to go and water jumped 

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:58.959
 above that is i just jumped clicked 

00:03:56.590 --> 00:04:05.190
 kick in the jump and he is like this 

00:03:58.959 --> 00:04:05.190
 as if pounced on the chosen one killed 

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:13.150
 well , I know on computer 

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:15.489
 toy, too, can not be such a platformer 

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:17.769
 cartoon similar but there is still a game 

00:04:15.489 --> 00:04:18.630
 Of course more abruptly as there can 

00:04:17.769 --> 00:04:23.080
 pass 

00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:26.199
 in various ways stealth mode here to 

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:32.289
 Unfortunately, there is no such thing, but not less 

00:04:26.199 --> 00:04:37.600
 all spectacular and beautiful so time 

00:04:32.289 --> 00:04:39.660
 run traps such let's go and 

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:41.699
 which until the end we will have 

00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:45.039
 round out 

00:04:41.699 --> 00:04:46.360
 I think everything is clear what kind of game and I 

00:04:45.039 --> 00:04:48.880
 I think everyone understood that it was necessary 

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:51.240
 be sure to put it just like that 

00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:51.240
 super 

00:04:53.250 --> 00:05:08.400
 agree hurry people laugh 

00:04:55.840 --> 00:05:08.400
 but the fact is that time presses pop pop 

00:05:18.530 --> 00:05:26.039
 enemies cut right and left 

00:05:23.330 --> 00:05:29.069
 damn nevsky pick level 

00:05:26.039 --> 00:05:31.919
 ended here is such a game so 

00:05:29.069 --> 00:05:33.960
 I definitely advise everyone to download 

00:05:31.919 --> 00:05:38.699
 have to rock her because she came from 

00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:40.409
 here just recently today and start 

00:05:38.699 --> 00:05:43.520
 I advise you to buy it, of course 

00:05:40.409 --> 00:05:47.000
 the full version that I probably will do 

00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:50.699
 after all here is a lot of emissions 

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:53.370
 here it is 1 pack with missions available 

00:05:50.699 --> 00:05:55.830
 Sema only 11 and then you see 

00:05:53.370 --> 00:05:59.780
 how many new chapters are still expected here 

00:05:55.830 --> 00:06:02.220
 but your head would trimmer 

00:05:59.780 --> 00:06:06.560
 subscribe to the channel to play only 

00:06:02.220 --> 00:06:06.560
 good all for now
