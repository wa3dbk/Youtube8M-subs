00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:51.270 
nation when they were the Syrians and
the<00:01:49.390> Persians<00:01:49.750> were<00:01:49.810> trying<00:01:50.590> to<00:01:50.740> invade<00:01:50.890> them

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:51.280 
the Persians were trying to invade them

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:51.900 
the Persians were trying to invade them
for<00:01:51.550> them

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:51.910 
for them

00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:54.300 
for them
keeping<00:01:52.270> this<00:01:52.420> animal<00:01:52.930> cult<00:01:53.170> was<00:01:53.890> very<00:01:54.130> very

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:54.310 
keeping this animal cult was very very

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:55.440 
keeping this animal cult was very very
important<00:01:54.610> because<00:01:54.730> they<00:01:54.910> were<00:01:55.030> the<00:01:55.180> only

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:55.450 
important because they were the only

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:57.000 
important because they were the only
culture<00:01:55.810> that<00:01:55.840> had<00:01:56.080> animal<00:01:56.530> calls<00:01:56.740> so<00:01:56.860> it

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:57.010 
culture that had animal calls so it

00:01:57.010 --> 00:01:59.490 
culture that had animal calls so it
makes<00:01:57.190> sense<00:01:57.400> that<00:01:57.640> this<00:01:58.120> was<00:01:58.360> so<00:01:58.659> widespread

00:01:59.490 --> 00:01:59.500 
makes sense that this was so widespread

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:02.750 
makes sense that this was so widespread
because<00:01:59.920> he<00:02:00.220> was<00:02:00.400> not<00:02:00.730> only<00:02:00.850> an<00:02:01.290> issue<00:02:02.290> of

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:02.760 
because he was not only an issue of

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:05.700 
because he was not only an issue of
religion<00:02:03.760> it<00:02:03.909> was<00:02:04.030> also<00:02:04.240> an<00:02:04.420> issue<00:02:04.570> of<00:02:04.900> nation

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:05.710 
religion it was also an issue of nation

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:08.850 
religion it was also an issue of nation
for<00:02:05.920> them<00:02:06.100> it<00:02:06.280> was<00:02:06.370> very<00:02:06.970> Egyptian<00:02:07.360> to<00:02:07.870> have

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:08.860 
for them it was very Egyptian to have

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:12.330 
for them it was very Egyptian to have
animals<00:02:09.369> that<00:02:09.580> you<00:02:10.149> consider<00:02:10.690> gods<00:02:11.040> yes<00:02:12.040> and

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:12.340 
animals that you consider gods yes and

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:13.890 
animals that you consider gods yes and
just<00:02:12.550> so<00:02:12.850> many<00:02:13.120> of<00:02:13.330> them<00:02:13.569> just

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:13.900 
just so many of them just

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:16.080 
just so many of them just
really<00:02:14.079> tells<00:02:14.739> us<00:02:14.890> a<00:02:14.920> lot<00:02:15.159> about<00:02:15.310> this<00:02:15.700> culture

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:16.090 
really tells us a lot about this culture

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:17.970 
really tells us a lot about this culture
and<00:02:16.569> they've<00:02:16.720> actually<00:02:16.870> the<00:02:17.260> archaeologists

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:17.980 
and they've actually the archaeologists

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:22.080 
and they've actually the archaeologists
now<00:02:18.430> believing<00:02:19.090> that<00:02:19.810> these<00:02:20.790> mummified<00:02:21.790> dogs

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:22.090 
now believing that these mummified dogs

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:25.740 
now believing that these mummified dogs
were<00:02:22.390> used<00:02:22.840> as<00:02:23.110> a<00:02:23.170> huge<00:02:23.980> part<00:02:24.370> of<00:02:24.700> the<00:02:25.150> economy

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:25.750 
were used as a huge part of the economy

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:29.190 
were used as a huge part of the economy
in<00:02:26.319> Egypt<00:02:26.860> so<00:02:27.129> literally<00:02:28.030> as<00:02:28.239> something<00:02:29.049> to

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:29.200 
in Egypt so literally as something to

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:31.679 
in Egypt so literally as something to

other creatures who would later be

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:03.839 
other creatures who would later be
mummified<00:03:01.569> so<00:03:02.079> just<00:03:02.290> this<00:03:02.379> huge<00:03:02.680> trade<00:03:03.549> and

00:03:03.839 --> 00:03:03.849 
mummified so just this huge trade and

00:03:03.849 --> 00:03:05.339 
mummified so just this huge trade and
and<00:03:04.000> he<00:03:04.329> said<00:03:04.510> that<00:03:04.629> it's<00:03:04.750> probably<00:03:05.200> an

00:03:05.339 --> 00:03:05.349 
and he said that it's probably an

00:03:05.349 --> 00:03:08.250 
and he said that it's probably an
ancestor<00:03:06.069> of<00:03:06.189> a<00:03:06.370> mass<00:03:06.670> tourism<00:03:07.239> industry<00:03:08.109> so

they literally you know bred dogs and
cats<00:03:10.329> and<00:03:10.510> mummified<00:03:11.379> them<00:03:11.620> just<00:03:11.859> to<00:03:11.980> make

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:12.010 
cats and mummified them just to make

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:14.220 
cats and mummified them just to make
money<00:03:12.609> huge<00:03:13.090> impact<00:03:13.450> on<00:03:13.510> the<00:03:13.629> economy<00:03:14.019> there

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:14.230 
money huge impact on the economy there

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:17.190 
money huge impact on the economy there
now<00:03:14.620> this<00:03:15.329> giant<00:03:16.329> burial<00:03:16.659> ground<00:03:16.900> but<00:03:17.049> these

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:17.200 
now this giant burial ground but these

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:21.360 
now this giant burial ground but these
tombs<00:03:17.590> was<00:03:18.489> explored<00:03:18.910> it's<00:03:19.060> about<00:03:19.500> 173<00:03:20.500> meters

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:21.370 
tombs was explored it's about 173 meters

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:23.699 
tombs was explored it's about 173 meters
down<00:03:21.609> lots<00:03:22.389> of<00:03:22.540> dark<00:03:22.780> tunnels<00:03:23.199> and<00:03:23.379> they<00:03:23.500> found

00:03:23.699 --> 00:03:23.709 
down lots of dark tunnels and they found

00:03:23.709 --> 00:03:26.610 
down lots of dark tunnels and they found
this<00:03:23.949> fossil<00:03:24.280> of<00:03:24.639> an<00:03:24.940> ancient<00:03:25.209> sea<00:03:26.049> monster

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:26.620 
this fossil of an ancient sea monster

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:29.280 
this fossil of an ancient sea monster
and<00:03:26.980> they<00:03:27.340> said<00:03:27.549> that<00:03:27.699> it's<00:03:27.849> likely<00:03:28.810> belonging

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:29.290 
and they said that it's likely belonging

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:32.729 
and they said that it's likely belonging
to<00:03:29.680> a<00:03:29.709> long<00:03:30.459> extinct<00:03:31.359> marine<00:03:31.750> vertebrae

00:03:32.729 --> 00:03:32.739 
to a long extinct marine vertebrae

00:03:32.739 --> 00:03:35.159 
to a long extinct marine vertebrae
likely<00:03:33.280> relative<00:03:33.639> of<00:03:33.760> modern-day<00:03:34.329> manatees

00:03:35.159 --> 00:03:35.169 
likely relative of modern-day manatees

00:03:35.169 --> 00:03:38.009 
likely relative of modern-day manatees
and<00:03:35.199> dugongs<00:03:35.530> but<00:03:36.489> really<00:03:37.000> fascinating<00:03:37.720> stuff

00:03:38.009 --> 00:03:38.019 
and dugongs but really fascinating stuff

00:03:38.019 --> 00:03:40.020 
and dugongs but really fascinating stuff
here<00:03:38.319> you<00:03:38.739> know<00:03:38.859> the<00:03:38.980> Egyptians<00:03:39.069> obviously

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:40.030 
here you know the Egyptians obviously

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:43.140 
here you know the Egyptians obviously
just<00:03:40.359> such<00:03:40.659> an<00:03:40.840> advanced<00:03:41.280> culture<00:03:42.280> so<00:03:42.970> much

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:43.150 
just such an advanced culture so much

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:45.000 
just such an advanced culture so much
more<00:03:43.389> to<00:03:43.510> learn<00:03:43.629> from<00:03:43.870> them<00:03:44.049> but<00:03:44.199> 8<00:03:44.409> million

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:45.010 
more to learn from them but 8 million

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:47.309 
more to learn from them but 8 million
dogs<00:03:45.280> were<00:03:46.060> buried<00:03:46.389> there<00:03:46.569> along<00:03:46.989> with<00:03:47.019> this

00:03:47.309 --> 00:03:47.319 
dogs were buried there along with this

00:03:47.319 --> 00:03:48.930 
dogs were buried there along with this
god<00:03:47.560> of<00:03:47.650> death<00:03:47.799> so<00:03:48.099> we<00:03:48.250> are<00:03:48.340> learning<00:03:48.459> more<00:03:48.790> and

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:48.940
