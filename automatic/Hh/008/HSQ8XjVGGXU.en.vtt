00:00:52.149 --> 00:00:52.159 
map though I was a little bit

00:00:53.619 --> 00:00:53.629 
disappointed when we landed on firing

00:00:53.629 --> 00:00:55.930

range<00:00:53.989> again<00:00:54.350> I<00:00:54.559> was<00:00:55.040> hoping<00:00:55.190> for<00:00:55.430> something<00:00:55.820> a

00:00:55.930 --> 00:00:55.940 
range again I was hoping for something a

00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:57.789 
range again I was hoping for something a
little<00:00:56.000> just<00:00:56.269> to<00:00:56.330> mix<00:00:56.540> things<00:00:56.690> up<00:00:57.049> compared<00:00:57.710> to

00:00:57.789 --> 00:00:57.799 
little just to mix things up compared to

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:59.890 
little just to mix things up compared to
the<00:00:58.100> last<00:00:58.309> first<00:00:58.729> game<00:00:59.000> after<00:00:59.150> my<00:00:59.390> prestige

00:00:59.890 --> 00:00:59.900 
the last first game after my prestige

00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:02.829 
the last first game after my prestige
but<00:01:00.559> what<00:01:00.739> can<00:01:00.830> you<00:01:00.920> do<00:01:01.150> firing<00:01:02.150> range<00:01:02.360> is<00:01:02.659> one

00:01:02.829 --> 00:01:02.839 
but what can you do firing range is one

00:01:02.839 --> 00:01:04.390 
but what can you do firing range is one
of<00:01:02.930> the<00:01:03.019> maps<00:01:03.290> I<00:01:03.500> tend<00:01:03.830> to<00:01:03.890> do<00:01:04.040> better<00:01:04.070> on

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:04.400 
of the maps I tend to do better on

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:07.480 
of the maps I tend to do better on
anyhow<00:01:04.970> so<00:01:05.390> worked<00:01:05.720> out<00:01:05.869> for<00:01:05.990> the<00:01:06.110> best<00:01:06.340> once<00:01:07.340> I

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:07.490

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:16.150 
was reviewing why the lifetime contracts
achievements<00:01:15.260> and<00:01:15.380> whatnot<00:01:15.710> in<00:01:15.950> the

00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:16.160

challenge<00:01:16.580> section<00:01:17.000> and<00:01:17.180> I<00:01:17.570> was<00:01:17.690> really

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:17.870 
challenge section and I was really

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:19.990 
challenge section and I was really
trying<00:01:17.990> to<00:01:18.140> plan<00:01:18.350> ahead<00:01:18.550> because<00:01:19.550> some<00:01:19.970> of

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:20.000 
trying to plan ahead because some of

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:21.540 
trying to plan ahead because some of
them<00:01:20.150> were<00:01:20.330> so<00:01:20.630> close<00:01:20.960> to<00:01:21.140> being<00:01:21.350> achieved

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:21.550 
them were so close to being achieved

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:23.920 
them were so close to being achieved
that<00:01:22.550> I<00:01:22.580> figured<00:01:23.030> we<00:01:23.090> really<00:01:23.390> helped<00:01:23.600> me<00:01:23.750> move

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:23.930 
that I figured we really helped me move

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:25.180 
that I figured we really helped me move
through<00:01:24.230> the<00:01:24.350> levels<00:01:24.710> a<00:01:24.770> little<00:01:24.920> bit<00:01:25.010> quicker

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:25.190 
through the levels a little bit quicker

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:27.940 
through the levels a little bit quicker
in<00:01:25.460> this<00:01:25.580> prestige<00:01:26.120> I<00:01:26.390> think<00:01:27.170> one<00:01:27.680> of<00:01:27.710> them<00:01:27.860> I

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:27.950 
in this prestige I think one of them I

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:30.820 
in this prestige I think one of them I
saved<00:01:28.250> was<00:01:28.580> the<00:01:29.300> lifetime<00:01:30.200> completed

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:30.830 
saved was the lifetime completed

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:33.430 
saved was the lifetime completed
contracts<00:01:31.580> and<00:01:31.760> as<00:01:32.510> soon<00:01:32.630> as<00:01:32.750> i<00:01:32.840> unlock<00:01:33.170> that<00:01:33.380> I

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:33.440 
contracts and as soon as i unlock that I

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:36.340 
contracts and as soon as i unlock that I
think<00:01:33.680> at<00:01:33.770> level<00:01:34.010> 4<00:01:34.250> a<00:01:34.280> level<00:01:34.670> 5<00:01:34.910> I<00:01:35.300> finished<00:01:36.230> up

move through them and I was actually
having<00:02:05.479> second<00:02:05.960> thoughts<00:02:06.170> about<00:02:06.320> doing<00:02:06.770> it

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:06.890 
having second thoughts about doing it

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:09.249 
having second thoughts about doing it
over<00:02:07.010> the<00:02:07.190> past<00:02:07.430> week<00:02:07.729> because<00:02:08.659> I<00:02:08.750> know<00:02:08.810> you

00:02:09.249 --> 00:02:09.259 
over the past week because I know you

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:11.020 
over the past week because I know you
know<00:02:09.530> there's<00:02:09.679> only<00:02:09.860> 15<00:02:10.250> prestige<00:02:10.489> levels

know there's only 15 prestige levels
here<00:02:11.209> in<00:02:11.299> black<00:02:11.480> ops<00:02:11.720> and<00:02:12.110> I<00:02:12.769> think<00:02:12.950> at<00:02:13.040> level

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:13.250 
here in black ops and I think at level

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:16.000 
here in black ops and I think at level
14<00:02:13.700> you<00:02:13.790> get<00:02:13.909> to<00:02:14.030> unlock<00:02:14.360> the<00:02:14.540> gold<00:02:14.750> guns<00:02:15.080> and<00:02:15.530> I

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:16.010 
14 you get to unlock the gold guns and I

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:17.890 
14 you get to unlock the gold guns and I
know<00:02:16.069> there<00:02:16.310> was<00:02:16.400> a<00:02:16.430> gold<00:02:16.700> gun<00:02:16.940> glitch<00:02:17.360> that

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:17.900 
know there was a gold gun glitch that

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:20.380 
know there was a gold gun glitch that
became<00:02:18.500> popular<00:02:19.069> over<00:02:19.459> the<00:02:19.700> last<00:02:19.730> couple

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:20.390 
became popular over the last couple

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:23.020 
became popular over the last couple
weeks<00:02:20.690> or<00:02:20.870> so<00:02:21.080> I<00:02:21.319> saw<00:02:21.950> a<00:02:21.980> couple<00:02:22.160> videos<00:02:22.310> of<00:02:22.910> it

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:23.030 
weeks or so I saw a couple videos of it

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:23.840 
weeks or so I saw a couple videos of it
by<00:02:23.240> other

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:23.850 
by other

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:26.540 
by other
haters<00:02:24.330> and<00:02:24.570> I<00:02:25.530> was<00:02:25.680> actually<00:02:25.920> somewhat

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:26.550 
haters and I was actually somewhat

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:28.820 
haters and I was actually somewhat
discouraged<00:02:26.910> by<00:02:27.270> that<00:02:27.300> not<00:02:28.140> for<00:02:28.530> the<00:02:28.620> fact

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:28.830 
discouraged by that not for the fact

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:32.060 
discouraged by that not for the fact
that<00:02:29.070> it<00:02:29.990> changes<00:02:30.990> the<00:02:31.170> game<00:02:31.200> type<00:02:31.680> even

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:32.070 
that it changes the game type even

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:34.400 
that it changes the game type even
though<00:02:32.130> I<00:02:32.160> know<00:02:32.600> there<00:02:33.600> were<00:02:33.690> some<00:02:33.840> pro<00:02:34.050> perks

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:34.410 
though I know there were some pro perks

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:36.500 
though I know there were some pro perks
associated<00:02:35.160> with<00:02:35.640> it<00:02:35.790> that<00:02:35.820> you<00:02:36.030> also<00:02:36.330> got<00:02:36.480> to

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:36.510 
associated with it that you also got to

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:38.330 
associated with it that you also got to
unlock<00:02:36.870> which<00:02:37.110> I<00:02:37.200> really<00:02:37.500> think<00:02:37.680> is<00:02:37.920> it

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:38.340 
unlock which I really think is it

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:40.370 
unlock which I really think is it
cheating<00:02:38.610> in<00:02:38.790> general<00:02:39.240> that<00:02:39.900> really<00:02:40.170> does

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:40.380 
cheating in general that really does

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:41.570 
cheating in general that really does
change<00:02:40.410> the<00:02:40.770> game<00:02:41.040> and<00:02:41.250> give<00:02:41.340> you<00:02:41.490> an

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:41.580 
change the game and give you an

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:43.940 
change the game and give you an
advantage<00:02:41.850> over<00:02:42.090> other<00:02:42.300> players<00:02:42.710> but<00:02:43.710> the

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:43.950 
advantage over other players but the

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:46.760 
advantage over other players but the
gold<00:02:44.310> guns<00:02:44.580> themselves<00:02:44.790> I<00:02:45.420> mean<00:02:45.600> we<00:02:46.470> worked

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:46.770 
gold guns themselves I mean we worked

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:48.530 
gold guns themselves I mean we worked
through<00:02:47.280> these<00:02:47.430> prestige<00:02:47.910> levels<00:02:48.300> and

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:48.540 
through these prestige levels and

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:50.180 
through these prestige levels and
because<00:02:49.320> we<00:02:49.530> want<00:02:49.740> to<00:02:49.830> send<00:02:50.010> some

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:50.190 
because we want to send some

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:53.420 
because we want to send some
accomplishment<00:02:50.970> and<00:02:51.180> the<00:02:51.710> gold<00:02:52.710> guns<00:02:52.980> pretty

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:53.430 
accomplishment and the gold guns pretty

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:56.000 
accomplishment and the gold guns pretty
much<00:02:53.520> goes<00:02:53.730> along<00:02:54.000> with<00:02:54.180> that<00:02:54.240> to<00:02:55.010> signify

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:56.010 
much goes along with that to signify

00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:58.250 
much goes along with that to signify
that<00:02:56.160> we<00:02:56.520> put<00:02:56.790> in<00:02:56.910> the<00:02:57.030> time<00:02:57.270> whether<00:02:57.750> you<00:02:58.170> know

00:02:58.250 --> 00:02:58.260 
that we put in the time whether you know

00:02:58.260 --> 00:02:59.210 
that we put in the time whether you know
it<00:02:58.290> doesn't<00:02:58.650> really<00:02:58.740> matter<00:02:58.890> if<00:02:59.040> you're<00:02:59.160> a

00:02:59.210 --> 00:02:59.220 
it doesn't really matter if you're a

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:00.680 
it doesn't really matter if you're a
great<00:02:59.430> player<00:02:59.580> or<00:02:59.790> not<00:02:59.850> if<00:03:00.150> you<00:03:00.270> play<00:03:00.450> enough

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:00.690 
great player or not if you play enough

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:01.940 
great player or not if you play enough
you're<00:03:00.870> going<00:03:01.020> to<00:03:01.080> motor<00:03:01.530> through<00:03:01.830> the

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:01.950 
you're going to motor through the

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:04.370 
you're going to motor through the
prestigious<00:03:02.490> anyhow<00:03:03.020> so<00:03:04.020> I<00:03:04.050> mean<00:03:04.200> that's

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:04.380 
prestigious anyhow so I mean that's

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:05.450 
prestigious anyhow so I mean that's
really<00:03:04.470> not<00:03:04.650> the<00:03:04.710> issue<00:03:04.830> as<00:03:05.220> far<00:03:05.370> as

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:05.460 
really not the issue as far as

00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:06.770 
really not the issue as far as
signifying<00:03:05.790> that<00:03:06.120> you're<00:03:06.330> a<00:03:06.360> great<00:03:06.600> player

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:06.780 
signifying that you're a great player

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:09.530 
signifying that you're a great player
but<00:03:07.170> at<00:03:07.710> least<00:03:07.830> signifies<00:03:08.310> that<00:03:08.340> you<00:03:08.730> play<00:03:09.360> the

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:09.540 
but at least signifies that you play the

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:11.690 
but at least signifies that you play the
game<00:03:09.750> often<00:03:10.380> enough<00:03:10.590> and<00:03:10.800> you<00:03:10.950> do<00:03:11.100> well<00:03:11.340> enough

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:11.700 
game often enough and you do well enough

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:14.450 
game often enough and you do well enough
at<00:03:12.330> it<00:03:12.570> to<00:03:13.230> be<00:03:13.440> able<00:03:13.620> to<00:03:13.680> move<00:03:13.800> to<00:03:13.980> the<00:03:14.070> prestige

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:14.460 
at it to be able to move to the prestige

00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:16.760 
at it to be able to move to the prestige
levels<00:03:14.850> and<00:03:15.060> if<00:03:15.900> they<00:03:16.110> took<00:03:16.380> that<00:03:16.590> away

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:16.770 
levels and if they took that away

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:18.980 
levels and if they took that away
because<00:03:17.370> the<00:03:17.610> achievement<00:03:18.060> system<00:03:18.240> is<00:03:18.540> now<00:03:18.720> so

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:18.990 
because the achievement system is now so

00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:20.360 
because the achievement system is now so
much<00:03:19.140> different<00:03:19.560> that<00:03:19.590> was<00:03:19.860> in<00:03:20.100> modern

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:20.370 
much different that was in modern
