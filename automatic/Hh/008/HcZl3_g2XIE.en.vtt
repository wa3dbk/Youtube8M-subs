what we're going to do it's it's put on

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:50.810 
what we're going to do it's it's put on
a<00:00:48.239> mount<00:00:48.510> now<00:00:48.809> the<00:00:49.559> thing<00:00:50.309> with<00:00:50.579> this

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820 
a mount now the thing with this

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:52.970 
a mount now the thing with this
transmitter<00:00:51.390> is<00:00:51.629> you<00:00:52.079> can<00:00:52.260> plug<00:00:52.440> it<00:00:52.620> in<00:00:52.739> I

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
transmitter is you can plug it in I

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:54.560 
transmitter is you can plug it in I
wouldn't<00:00:53.340> suggest<00:00:53.430> just<00:00:53.879> leaving<00:00:54.180> it<00:00:54.300> on<00:00:54.329> your

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:54.570 
wouldn't suggest just leaving it on your

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:57.560 
wouldn't suggest just leaving it on your
car<00:00:54.809> seat<00:00:55.230> and<00:00:55.920> whatnot<00:00:56.640> because<00:00:56.850> them<00:00:57.180> if<00:00:57.420> it

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 
car seat and whatnot because them if it

00:00:57.570 --> 00:00:58.700 
car seat and whatnot because them if it
moves<00:00:57.780> around<00:00:57.960> then<00:00:58.350> you're<00:00:58.469> going<00:00:58.559> to<00:00:58.620> get

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
moves around then you're going to get

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:00.709 
moves around then you're going to get
static<00:00:59.160> so<00:00:59.309> I<00:00:59.340> suggest<00:00:59.760> getting<00:00:59.910> a<00:01:00.120> holder<00:01:00.539> or

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719 
static so I suggest getting a holder or

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:03.770 
static so I suggest getting a holder or
having<00:01:01.680> a<00:01:01.770> place<00:01:02.010> for<00:01:02.969> your<00:01:03.180> iphone<00:01:03.570> or<00:01:03.750> your

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:15.299 
into the bottom now i'm doing this with

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:21.160 
into the bottom now i'm doing this with
one<00:01:15.450> hand<00:01:15.509> so<00:01:16.220> excuse<00:01:17.220> the<00:01:17.450> the<00:01:18.450> wiggle<00:01:18.840> here

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:21.170 
one hand so excuse the the wiggle here

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:23.990 
one hand so excuse the the wiggle here
but<00:01:22.170> as<00:01:22.290> soon<00:01:22.470> as<00:01:22.590> you<00:01:22.740> plug<00:01:22.950> it<00:01:23.159> in<00:01:23.280> you're

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000 
but as soon as you plug it in you're

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:25.640 
but as soon as you plug it in you're
going<00:01:24.150> to<00:01:24.210> notice<00:01:24.390> it<00:01:24.689> lights<00:01:24.900> up<00:01:25.110> blue<00:01:25.290> and

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650 
going to notice it lights up blue and

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:28.219 
going to notice it lights up blue and
you<00:01:26.430> can<00:01:26.610> actually<00:01:26.790> change<00:01:27.360> the<00:01:27.509> stations<00:01:28.049> now

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
you can actually change the stations now

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:32.960 
you can actually change the stations now
the<00:01:28.710> station's<00:01:29.130> work<00:01:29.340> from<00:01:29.640> 88.1<00:01:30.600> 210<00:01:31.409> 7.9<00:01:32.310> so

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970 
the station's work from 88.1 210 7.9 so

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:37.880 
the station's work from 88.1 210 7.9 so
i<00:01:33.900> suggest<00:01:34.650> using<00:01:34.920> a<00:01:35.340> low<00:01:36.020> frequency<00:01:37.020> station

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
i suggest using a low frequency station

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:42.140 
i suggest using a low frequency station
anywhere<00:01:38.280> from<00:01:38.460> 88.1<00:01:39.180> 22<00:01:40.280> 90.9<00:01:41.280> those

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.150 
anywhere from 88.1 22 90.9 those

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:45.679 
anywhere from 88.1 22 90.9 those
stations<00:01:42.600> work<00:01:42.869> the<00:01:43.140> best<00:01:43.350> and<00:01:43.909> and<00:01:44.909> are<00:01:45.540> the

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:45.689 
stations work the best and and are the

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:47.569 
stations work the best and and are the
clearest<00:01:46.110> so<00:01:46.350> i'm<00:01:46.920> just<00:01:46.979> going<00:01:47.220> to<00:01:47.280> make<00:01:47.399> sure

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:47.579 
clearest so i'm just going to make sure

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:50.780 
clearest so i'm just going to make sure
this<00:01:47.729> is<00:01:47.790> plugged<00:01:48.119> in<00:01:49.009> and<00:01:50.009> we're<00:01:50.640> going<00:01:50.759> to

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:50.790 
this is plugged in and we're going to

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:53.240 
this is plugged in and we're going to
put<00:01:50.850> it<00:01:51.090> to<00:01:51.240> eighty<00:01:51.479> eight<00:01:51.689> seven<00:01:52.320> what's<00:01:53.130> the

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:53.250 
put it to eighty eight seven what's the

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:54.560 
put it to eighty eight seven what's the
station<00:01:53.610> i'm<00:01:53.700> going<00:01:53.850> to<00:01:53.909> choose<00:01:54.090> now<00:01:54.360> we're

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:54.570 
station i'm going to choose now we're

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:55.999
