 European lists in the USA in Australia for example 

00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:08.210
 and becoming an osteopath means writing sun university because there are courses 

00:00:08.209 --> 00:00:09.700
 regulated 

00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:13.030

 it is possible to prepare in osteopathy attending schools that symbolize the 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:34.120
 adequate training criteria 

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:38.350
 therefore all the schools of osteopathy in Italy follow these criteria 

00:00:39.310 --> 00:00:43.240
 unfortunately in Italy there is a bit of confusion only some schools are 

00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:43.940
 united 

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:46.579
 and have established a national register 

00:00:46.579 --> 00:00:48.730
 that send to some foreign directors 

00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:53.149
 and pippo tr hold up the quality of education and profession 

00:00:53.149 --> 00:00:56.049

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:40.310
 some countries of the world such as Great Britain, Belgium and the United States 

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:44.450
 Osteopathy is a fully recognized medical science 

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:49.680
 the title issued by the schools here in Italy had a legal value in the title 

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:53.139
 of osteopath of the eyes leaves 6 years of training 

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:57.550
 the sun seychelles that at the end of the professional study cycle here 

00:01:57.550 --> 00:01:59.270
 site all knowledge 

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:03.299
 professional deontological, theoretical and practical training 

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:06.000
 in the field of osteopathic profession 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:07.869
 in Italy 

00:02:07.869 --> 00:02:11.159
 professional qualification is not possible because it has not yet been 

00:02:11.159 --> 00:02:12.789
 regulated profession 

00:02:12.789 --> 00:02:17.179
 and even if there are various bills that are bringing more and more 

00:02:17.179 --> 00:02:19.769
 close to this hour 

00:02:19.769 --> 00:02:23.200
 they have regulation and it does not mean not legality 

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:28.120
 every osteopath works in the field of well-being of every client of the osteopath and 

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:33.150
 asks the osteopath to have treatments that can help her 

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:37.290
 body to improve health conditions for health is not meant 

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:42.519
 only the absence of disease but full awareness fineness from the point 

00:02:42.519 --> 00:02:47.810
 physical and even biochemical sight and complete health 

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:50.270
 tissue ppl of the organism 

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:53.179
 the osteopath then works in this area in helping 

00:02:53.179 --> 00:02:57.569
 the subject to find the way to full health 

00:02:57.569 --> 00:03:00.569

00:03:01.369 --> 00:03:05.199
 cestelli doctor how it works and how our school is organized 

00:03:06.389 --> 00:03:10.599

00:03:10.599 --> 00:03:11.370

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:13.450
 organized in two jurisdictions 

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:16.449
 we pay you part-time orders 

00:03:16.449 --> 00:03:18.120

00:03:26.169 --> 00:03:27.859
 own university course 

00:03:27.859 --> 00:03:33.810
 and which produces and like every year 60 and cfv echo of formation through presence 

00:03:33.809 --> 00:03:38.109
 e'un didactic editions of practice theory the clinical internship at the end 

00:03:38.109 --> 00:03:41.609
 of the inter-school to become osteopaths it is necessary to support a 

00:03:41.609 --> 00:03:46.159
 examination with a mixed national and sometimes international commission 

00:03:46.159 --> 00:03:48.580
 and key pass the nico exam 

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:51.200
 and that is carried out precisely in the treatment of a subject of a 

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:52.079
 patient 

00:03:52.079 --> 00:03:55.079
 to discuss the thesis a research thesis 

00:03:55.619 --> 00:04:00.049
 Doctor the dirty word explained that the school of osteopathy is divided into two 

00:04:00.049 --> 00:04:00.979
 systems 

00:04:00.979 --> 00:04:05.829
 full-time connection and part-time ordering we have here with us 

00:04:05.829 --> 00:04:08.829
 Full-time student let's see what you say 

00:04:09.359 --> 00:04:14.790
 sono maria teresa laurenziello twenty years it is frequent I have the school of the subjects to 

00:04:14.789 --> 00:04:16.189
 full time 

00:04:16.189 --> 00:04:19.229
 from the various teresa because you have chosen to study osteopathy 

00:04:19.889 --> 00:04:22.850
 to blow the passion for others 

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:27.380
 it's earth allows you to work with your hands and above all to search for causes 

00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:30.629
 and not the symptoms in patients 

00:04:30.629 --> 00:04:35.870
 you can concretely explain what it means to be a time student 

00:04:35.869 --> 00:04:37.259
 full of this school 

00:04:37.259 --> 00:04:42.379
 Well the nymphs' frequency is fine every week 

00:04:42.379 --> 00:04:47.610
 center a university-type frequency that lasts 5 years and that at 

00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:50.229
 end will give us a diploma of god 

00:04:50.229 --> 00:04:52.199
 this school seems difficult to me 

00:04:52.199 --> 00:04:58.310
 well there is so much to study so much to learn in fact we have teachers who 

00:04:58.310 --> 00:05:04.220
 destiny the strange on the theory also on the practice I did it myself 

00:05:04.220 --> 00:05:10.480
 we have a roman osteopathic approach with a lot of hey and in-between manual skills 

00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:12.159
 ariccia karaoke 

00:05:12.159 --> 00:05:14.700
 so many internships to learn 

00:05:14.700 --> 00:05:17.229
 I have more in depth 

00:05:17.229 --> 00:05:20.960
 maria teresa what do you expect from this title of osteopath that 

00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:22.159
 will ever reach 

00:05:22.159 --> 00:05:24.230
 well i don't expect web 

00:05:24.230 --> 00:05:30.450
 expectations and are relative as it is not recognized today and in Italy 

00:05:30.450 --> 00:05:31.610
 title and 

00:05:31.610 --> 00:05:37.949
 osteopath but in fact I didn't think to go to the professionals to do 

00:05:37.949 --> 00:05:43.849
 health care or doctor's mind for me to have an approach or 

00:05:43.849 --> 00:05:48.900
 on patients not following state laws 

00:05:50.610 --> 00:05:53.020
 nothing goodbye 

00:05:53.020 --> 00:05:56.710
 we have seen how full-time sorting works now 

00:05:56.710 --> 00:06:00.020
 let's see how part-time sorting works 

00:06:00.020 --> 00:06:03.870
 the substantial difference lies in the fact that to access this order 

00:06:03.870 --> 00:06:09.530
 you have to have a bachelor's degree but this information better certifies the 

00:06:09.530 --> 00:06:14.139
 our colleague francesco who is a student of the time system 

00:06:14.139 --> 00:06:17.599

00:06:20.119 --> 00:06:21.650

00:06:25.930 --> 00:06:28.930
