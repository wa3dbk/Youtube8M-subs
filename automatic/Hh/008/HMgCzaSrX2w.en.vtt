here<00:01:34.950> the<00:01:35.460> attack<00:01:35.820> that<00:01:36.090> he<00:01:36.329> comes<00:01:36.630> with<00:01:36.750> is

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229 
here the attack that he comes with is

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:41.780 
here the attack that he comes with is
nail<00:01:37.650> rain<00:01:38.009> drying<00:01:38.700> claw<00:01:39.420> head<00:01:40.380> but<00:01:40.710> I<00:01:40.979> think

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:41.790 
nail rain drying claw head but I think

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:43.840 
nail rain drying claw head but I think
headbutt<00:01:42.270> should<00:01:42.509> be<00:01:42.630> like<00:01:42.869> at<00:01:43.020> the<00:01:43.110> beginning

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:43.850 
headbutt should be like at the beginning

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:48.770 
headbutt should be like at the beginning
but<00:01:44.850> I<00:01:44.909> you<00:01:45.390> know<00:01:45.420> I<00:01:46.040> don't<00:01:47.040> know<00:01:47.180> and<00:01:48.180> I<00:01:48.630> think

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780 
but I you know I don't know and I think

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:53.810 
but I you know I don't know and I think
that<00:01:49.290> nail<00:01:49.619> range<00:01:50.070> should<00:01:50.430> be<00:01:50.549> at<00:01:50.670> the<00:01:50.820> end<00:01:52.820> but

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:53.820 
that nail range should be at the end but

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:56.649 
that nail range should be at the end but
you<00:01:54.180> know<00:01:54.270> that's<00:01:54.659> my<00:01:54.960> opinion<00:01:55.320> anyways<00:01:55.799> uh

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:23.270 
12 hours rather now where is our dragon

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:28.130 
12 hours rather now where is our dragon
dragon<00:02:26.180> they<00:02:27.180> really<00:02:27.510> need<00:02:27.690> to<00:02:27.720> do<00:02:27.990> the

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:28.140 
dragon they really need to do the

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:32.360 
dragon they really need to do the
sorting<00:02:28.650> thing<00:02:29.690> you<00:02:30.690> know<00:02:30.840> because<00:02:31.370> there's

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:32.370 
sorting thing you know because there's

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:34.280 
sorting thing you know because there's
just<00:02:32.460> so<00:02:32.820> many<00:02:32.940> dragons<00:02:33.630> in<00:02:33.750> the<00:02:33.840> game<00:02:34.080> now

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:34.290 
just so many dragons in the game now

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:37.280 
just so many dragons in the game now
it's<00:02:34.920> crazy<00:02:35.550> not<00:02:36.090> to<00:02:36.120> do<00:02:36.420> the<00:02:36.570> sorting<00:02:37.020> thing

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:37.290 
it's crazy not to do the sorting thing

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:40.310 
it's crazy not to do the sorting thing
usually<00:02:37.950> a<00:02:38.220> sorting<00:02:38.730> thing<00:02:38.970> makes<00:02:39.480> it<00:02:39.720> so<00:02:39.990> much

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:40.320 
usually a sorting thing makes it so much

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:47.410 
usually a sorting thing makes it so much
easier<00:02:40.560> for<00:02:41.310> you<00:02:41.490> to<00:02:42.980> find<00:02:43.980> your<00:02:44.280> dragons

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:47.420 

00:02:47.420 --> 00:03:04.410 

alright<00:02:48.420> going<00:02:48.780> into<00:02:49.320> battle<00:02:49.560> here

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:04.420 

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:06.410 

you<00:03:05.050> know<00:03:05.140> I'm<00:03:05.290> always<00:03:05.500> wondering<00:03:05.860> why<00:03:06.220> do

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:06.420 
you know I'm always wondering why do

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:11.400 
you know I'm always wondering why do
they<00:03:07.420> get<00:03:07.720> first<00:03:08.080> attack<00:03:09.959> also<00:03:10.959> they<00:03:11.140> should

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:11.410 
they get first attack also they should

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:13.589 
they get first attack also they should
be<00:03:11.709> able<00:03:11.800> to<00:03:12.040> miss<00:03:12.340> that's<00:03:12.730> a<00:03:12.910> I<00:03:13.120> think<00:03:13.270> it

00:03:13.589 --> 00:03:13.599 
be able to miss that's a I think it

00:03:13.599 --> 00:03:15.900 
be able to miss that's a I think it
would<00:03:13.690> be<00:03:13.780> good<00:03:14.020> if<00:03:14.290> they<00:03:15.010> have<00:03:15.220> the<00:03:15.459> ability

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:15.910 
would be good if they have the ability

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:18.750 
would be good if they have the ability
to<00:03:15.940> miss<00:03:16.390> and<00:03:16.720> we<00:03:17.230> did<00:03:17.410> really<00:03:17.590> bad<00:03:17.830> there<00:03:18.190> all

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:18.760 
to miss and we did really bad there all

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:20.790 
to miss and we did really bad there all
right<00:03:18.940> maybe<00:03:19.180> we<00:03:19.270> should've<00:03:19.690> used<00:03:20.500> something

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:20.800 
right maybe we should've used something

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:23.190 
right maybe we should've used something
else<00:03:21.040> all<00:03:21.370> right<00:03:21.660> now<00:03:22.660> we're<00:03:22.840> sending<00:03:23.050> a

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:23.200 
else all right now we're sending a

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:24.960 
else all right now we're sending a
dragon<00:03:23.650> and<00:03:23.800> there<00:03:24.040> it<00:03:24.130> is<00:03:24.250> I<00:03:24.520> think<00:03:24.819> this

00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:24.970 
dragon and there it is I think this

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:27.449 
dragon and there it is I think this
dragon<00:03:25.330> is<00:03:25.450> like<00:03:25.810> it's<00:03:26.440> pretty<00:03:26.770> beefed<00:03:27.190> up

00:03:27.449 --> 00:03:27.459 
dragon is like it's pretty beefed up

00:03:27.459 --> 00:03:30.059 
dragon is like it's pretty beefed up
with<00:03:27.910> metal<00:03:28.450> look<00:03:28.630> at<00:03:28.780> its<00:03:28.959> wings<00:03:29.440> it's<00:03:29.830> made

00:03:30.059 --> 00:03:30.069 
with metal look at its wings it's made

00:03:30.069 --> 00:03:35.280 
with metal look at its wings it's made
out<00:03:30.280> like<00:03:30.310> metal<00:03:31.180> stuff<00:03:32.100> and<00:03:33.100> let's<00:03:33.880> use<00:03:34.290> the

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:35.290 
out like metal stuff and let's use the

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:38.729 
out like metal stuff and let's use the
last<00:03:35.530> attack<00:03:37.350> all<00:03:38.350> right

00:03:38.729 --> 00:03:38.739 
last attack all right

00:03:38.739 --> 00:03:40.890 
last attack all right
simple<00:03:39.160> animation<00:03:39.819> there<00:03:40.030> it<00:03:40.330> just<00:03:40.569> bends

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:40.900 
simple animation there it just bends

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:46.370 
simple animation there it just bends
forward<00:03:41.760> really<00:03:42.760> weak<00:03:43.030> attack<00:03:43.890> and<00:03:44.890> he<00:03:45.790> dies

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:46.380 
forward really weak attack and he dies

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:49.259 
forward really weak attack and he dies
all<00:03:47.380> right<00:03:47.560> that's<00:03:48.190> pretty<00:03:48.400> much<00:03:48.730> it<00:03:49.030> uh<00:03:49.209> I

00:03:49.259 --> 00:03:49.269 
all right that's pretty much it uh I

00:03:49.269 --> 00:03:51.420 
all right that's pretty much it uh I
wasn't<00:03:50.170> expecting<00:03:50.410> that

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:51.430 
wasn't expecting that

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:53.309 
wasn't expecting that
I<00:03:51.459> wasn't<00:03:51.910> expecting<00:03:52.630> him<00:03:52.750> to<00:03:52.810> die<00:03:53.049> because

00:03:53.309 --> 00:03:53.319 
I wasn't expecting him to die because

00:03:53.319 --> 00:03:55.080 
I wasn't expecting him to die because
usually<00:03:53.500> when<00:03:54.100> I<00:03:54.130> do<00:03:54.250> this<00:03:54.549> thing<00:03:54.760> he<00:03:54.910> doesn't

00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:55.090 
usually when I do this thing he doesn't

00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:57.780 
usually when I do this thing he doesn't
die<00:03:55.420> they<00:03:56.200> end<00:03:56.680> up<00:03:56.830> a<00:03:56.950> little<00:03:57.069> with<00:03:57.250> like<00:03:57.459> one

00:03:57.780 --> 00:03:57.790 
die they end up a little with like one

00:03:57.790 --> 00:04:00.750 
die they end up a little with like one
HP<00:03:58.090> or<00:03:58.660> something<00:03:59.140> or<00:03:59.290> maybe<00:03:59.440> 100<00:04:00.190> but<00:04:00.400> it<00:04:00.549> you

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:00.760 
HP or something or maybe 100 but it you

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:02.699 
HP or something or maybe 100 but it you
know<00:04:00.880> this<00:04:01.060> dragon<00:04:01.480> actually<00:04:01.630> died<00:04:02.049> but

00:04:02.699 --> 00:04:02.709 
know this dragon actually died but

00:04:02.709 --> 00:04:04.530 
know this dragon actually died but
that's<00:04:02.920> pretty<00:04:03.160> much<00:04:03.400> it<00:04:03.670> and<00:04:03.940> as<00:04:04.180> you<00:04:04.239> can<00:04:04.390> see

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:04.540 
that's pretty much it and as you can see

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:07.949 
that's pretty much it and as you can see
his<00:04:05.380> animation<00:04:06.130> is<00:04:06.280> pretty<00:04:06.489> basic<00:04:06.850> he<00:04:07.690> doesn't

00:04:07.949 --> 00:04:07.959 
his animation is pretty basic he doesn't

00:04:07.959 --> 00:04:10.560 
his animation is pretty basic he doesn't
do<00:04:08.140> anything<00:04:08.380> and<00:04:08.799> you<00:04:09.640> know<00:04:09.760> acquitting<00:04:10.329> some

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:10.570 
do anything and you know acquitting some

00:04:10.570 --> 00:04:14.009 
do anything and you know acquitting some
players<00:04:10.810> online<00:04:11.109> and<00:04:11.739> as<00:04:12.340> I<00:04:12.519> call<00:04:12.790> it<00:04:12.820> -<00:04:13.269> he

00:04:14.009 --> 00:04:14.019 
players online and as I call it - he

00:04:14.019 --> 00:04:16.949 
players online and as I call it - he
just<00:04:14.260> bends<00:04:14.530> forward<00:04:15.030> and<00:04:16.030> that<00:04:16.479> that<00:04:16.690> that's

00:04:16.949 --> 00:04:16.959 
just bends forward and that that that's

00:04:16.959 --> 00:04:19.469 
just bends forward and that that that's
essentially<00:04:17.829> what<00:04:17.979> he<00:04:18.100> does<00:04:18.340> for<00:04:18.609> his<00:04:19.030> battle

00:04:19.469 --> 00:04:19.479 
essentially what he does for his battle

00:04:19.479 --> 00:04:22.560 
essentially what he does for his battle
skill<00:04:19.780> as<00:04:20.019> he<00:04:20.470> launches<00:04:20.979> his<00:04:21.190> attack<00:04:21.640> I<00:04:21.970> know

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:22.570 
skill as he launches his attack I know

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:24.360 
skill as he launches his attack I know
