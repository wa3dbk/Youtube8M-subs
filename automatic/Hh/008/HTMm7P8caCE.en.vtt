00:00:01.460 --> 00:00:06.960
 you want to conquer a man but this yes 

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:11.030
 shows little interest shows a 

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:13.130
 certain detachment from you does not prove 

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:16.340
 interest 

00:00:13.130 --> 00:00:18.260
 then how to do a 

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:20.800
 so much must start from the assumption that 

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:24.040
 if it does not show interest in comparisons 

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:27.110
 there may be different reasons 

00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:29.150
 the main motivation is that which 

00:00:27.110 --> 00:00:33.400
 failed to make contact 

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:35.600
 with his emotion you failed to 

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:37.940
 amplify those that are his 

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:41.900
 however, there are also emotions 

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:43.730
 people who are naturally detached 

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:46.220
 who have difficulty engaging 

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:48.110
 precisely because they had an imprint 

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:51.520
 of this kind have had a 

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:54.020
 imprinting where involvement is 

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:55.760
 in their childhood it was a lot 

00:00:54.020 --> 00:01:00.380
 limited because it is linked to 

00:00:55.760 --> 00:01:04.089
 penalties for which they have difficulty for 

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:06.649
 this is why you have to learn to a 

00:01:04.089 --> 00:01:08.270
 discriminate let's say between the two 

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:10.640
 types because they are two people 

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:12.560
 completely different the first is one 

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:15.440
 emotional person you are not 

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:19.250
 giving the right nourishment and reason 

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:21.470
 second, a person is very much 

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:22.819
 very rational logic for logic to the 

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:24.979
 which you are not giving enough 

00:01:22.819 --> 00:01:28.280
 reasons therefore if it fails to 

00:01:24.979 --> 00:01:30.440
 understand to discriminate for this between 

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:32.959
 these two types of people then in 

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:35.569
 big difficulties both of us 

00:01:32.959 --> 00:01:38.090
 they prove detached but for reasons 

00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:41.149
 opposite then you must first discriminate 

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:42.830
 whether it is dealing with an emotional person or 

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:46.160
 whether to deal with an inter person 

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:48.560
 logic how do you understand it 

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:50.690
 well a bit if you can get in 

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:54.020
 contact these people in some way 

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:55.910
 emotional people like it communicate it 

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:58.340
 the fact that the reasons are 

00:01:55.910 --> 00:02:00.739
 people who seem even more solar 

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:05.599
 more cheerful and reason much less 

00:02:00.739 --> 00:02:07.899
 they are more impulsive at sail times they seem 

00:02:05.599 --> 00:02:11.110
 a little head in the clouds 

00:02:07.899 --> 00:02:14.989
 maybe you talk to me distracted levels 

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:18.560
 they also have their own story 

00:02:14.989 --> 00:02:20.540
 of life that is made of very loves 

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:24.379
 turned on very intense then maybe 

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:26.420
 end up again while others start 

00:02:24.379 --> 00:02:28.159
 instead people for their own logic 

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:29.030
 for the fact that they always go to the 

00:02:28.159 --> 00:02:32.209
 search 

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:37.910
 the options appear more bizarre 

00:02:32.209 --> 00:02:40.670
 more tignos become specialists in 

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:44.180
 something we say they go much more 

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:46.489
 in depth so if they must if yes 

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:48.110
 passionate about something and selling crap 

00:02:46.489 --> 00:02:49.300
 all the way down while pressure 

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:52.010
 emotional and vice versa 

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:56.120
 I change even I don't know sport 

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:58.760
 Hobbies today are tennis enthusiasts 

00:02:56.120 --> 00:03:01.340
 tomorrow of Argentine tango the day after tomorrow 

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:02.030
 instead of golf and the day after 

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:05.360
 another thing 

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:07.010
 here they change while instead a person 

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:09.980
 in logic when imitating something 

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:13.750
 he wants to investigate it, I don't say he's alone 

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:18.970
 that of life, however, let us say 

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:21.800
 deepen a lot and then 

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:24.500
 difference is easily perceived 

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:26.860
 hence a detached emotional person 

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:31.280
 because we needlessly therefore 

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:34.250
 as you say if you want to somehow 

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:36.799
 enter inside you have to produce strong 

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:39.650
 emotions file to make mountains 

00:03:36.799 --> 00:03:42.680
 short Russian emotional all the 

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:47.090
 repertoire of emotion and using all 

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:49.610
 the ways fantasies the strong emotions 

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:51.079
 fears all worth broth because 

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:53.950
 that's motivational people 

00:03:51.079 --> 00:03:56.390
 they want while people logically 

00:03:53.950 --> 00:04:00.829
 if it proves detached because 

00:03:56.390 --> 00:04:02.720
 through reasoning he thinks you 

00:04:00.829 --> 00:04:04.970
 for some reason not if the person 

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:06.829
 right then you have to give this reason 

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:09.700
 understand what his beliefs are about 

00:04:06.829 --> 00:04:12.380
 values etcetera etc. go to 

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:15.590
 satisfy them so knowing this succeeds 

00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:19.010
 we say to break disinterest in both 

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:20.720
 emotional people both of people and for 

00:04:19.010 --> 00:04:23.630
 logics and then later could proceed 

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:25.250
 with winning strategies well for 

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:28.300
 this video I give you an appointment at 

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:31.690
 next times to follow me on the http blog
