00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:02.840 
the offseason just for general strength
I<00:02:01.020> think<00:02:01.320> the<00:02:01.439> low<00:02:01.619> bar<00:02:01.829> is<00:02:02.040> better<00:02:02.460> for

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:02.850 
I think the low bar is better for

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:04.490 
I think the low bar is better for
overall<00:02:03.149> athletic<00:02:03.750> performance<00:02:04.290> I<00:02:04.380> know<00:02:04.469> a

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:04.500 
overall athletic performance I know a

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:06.170 
overall athletic performance I know a
lot<00:02:04.649> of<00:02:04.710> coaches<00:02:05.100> you<00:02:05.219> agree<00:02:05.610> that<00:02:05.640> will<00:02:05.969> piss

00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:10.020 
some people off including ripple toe but

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:14.510 
some people off including ripple toe but
it<00:02:10.680> is<00:02:10.830> what<00:02:11.010> it<00:02:11.130> is<00:02:11.250> my<00:02:12.000> opinion<00:02:13.160> but<00:02:14.160> if<00:02:14.370> you

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:14.520 
it is what it is my opinion but if you

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:17.300

00:04:15.740 --> 00:04:15.750 
marathons it can be done you just gotta

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:18.950

00:04:20.510 --> 00:04:20.520 
course to get around that ideally that's

00:04:20.520 --> 00:04:22.390 
course to get around that ideally that's
why<00:04:20.820> he<00:04:21.150> likes

00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:22.400 
why he likes

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:25.510 
why he likes

type systems are concurrent training

00:04:27.169 --> 00:04:29.680 
type systems are concurrent training
because<00:04:27.410> it<00:04:27.530> allows<00:04:28.000> him<00:04:29.000> to<00:04:29.030> Train<00:04:29.479> himself

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:29.690 
because it allows him to Train himself

00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:33.189 
because it allows him to Train himself
and<00:04:30.229> his<00:04:30.350> athletes<00:04:30.889> around<00:04:31.750> the<00:04:32.750> recovery

00:04:33.189 --> 00:04:33.199 
and his athletes around the recovery

00:04:33.199 --> 00:04:34.510 
and his athletes around the recovery
blocks<00:04:33.470> from<00:04:33.590> that<00:04:33.800> so<00:04:34.009> that<00:04:34.130> their<00:04:34.280> higher

00:04:34.510 --> 00:04:34.520 
blocks from that so that their higher

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:36.450 
blocks from that so that their higher
intensity<00:04:35.060> cardio<00:04:35.389> can<00:04:35.780> be<00:04:35.900> done<00:04:36.139> immediately

00:04:36.450 --> 00:04:36.460 
intensity cardio can be done immediately

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:39.129 
intensity cardio can be done immediately
after<00:04:37.460> higher<00:04:37.669> intensity<00:04:38.270> lifting<00:04:38.630> days<00:04:38.840> and

00:04:39.129 --> 00:04:39.139 
after higher intensity lifting days and

00:04:39.139 --> 00:04:40.270 
after higher intensity lifting days and
then<00:04:39.229> while<00:04:39.410> they're<00:04:39.440> recovering<00:04:39.860> from<00:04:40.190> that

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:40.280 
then while they're recovering from that

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:42.460 
then while they're recovering from that
they're<00:04:41.090> using<00:04:41.240> a<00:04:41.449> different<00:04:41.780> energy<00:04:41.930> system

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:42.470 
they're using a different energy system

00:04:42.470 --> 00:04:43.990 
they're using a different energy system
so<00:04:42.650> that<00:04:42.680> they're<00:04:42.979> doing<00:04:43.130> after<00:04:43.580> all<00:04:43.789> their

00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:44.000 
so that they're doing after all their

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:46.450 
so that they're doing after all their
higher<00:04:44.270> volume<00:04:44.930> lighter<00:04:45.289> training<00:04:45.889> there

00:04:46.450 --> 00:04:46.460 
higher volume lighter training there

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:48.760 
higher volume lighter training there
immediately<00:04:46.699> doing<00:04:47.240> you<00:04:47.570> know<00:04:47.750> their<00:04:48.050> extreme

00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:48.770 
immediately doing you know their extreme

00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:51.580 
immediately doing you know their extreme
endurance<00:04:49.100> training<00:04:49.660> so<00:04:50.660> that<00:04:50.690> the<00:04:51.289> recovery

00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:51.590 
endurance training so that the recovery

00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:54.640 
endurance training so that the recovery
is<00:04:51.889> undulating<00:04:53.050> accordingly<00:04:54.050> to<00:04:54.289> keep<00:04:54.470> it

00:04:54.640 --> 00:04:54.650 
is undulating accordingly to keep it

00:04:54.650 --> 00:04:57.219 
is undulating accordingly to keep it
mixed<00:04:55.490> in<00:04:55.610> with<00:04:55.729> the<00:04:55.880> same<00:04:56.090> or<00:04:56.600> similar<00:04:56.810> energy

00:04:57.229 --> 00:05:01.150 
mixed in with the same or similar energy
systems<00:04:57.949> between<00:04:58.400> the<00:04:58.520> training<00:04:58.910> days<00:05:00.070> so<00:05:01.070> you

00:05:01.150 --> 00:05:01.160 
systems between the training days so you

00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:04.300 
systems between the training days so you
can<00:05:01.639> program<00:05:02.830> appropriately<00:05:03.830> particularly

00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:04.310 
can program appropriately particularly

00:05:04.310 --> 00:05:06.939 
can program appropriately particularly
if<00:05:04.370> you<00:05:04.430> look<00:05:04.610> at<00:05:04.729> Alex<00:05:05.060> fiat<00:05:05.419> of<00:05:05.449> stuff<00:05:05.949> you

00:05:06.939 --> 00:05:06.949 
if you look at Alex fiat of stuff you

00:05:06.949 --> 00:05:08.920 
if you look at Alex fiat of stuff you
can<00:05:06.979> program<00:05:07.430> for<00:05:07.940> both<00:05:08.150> and<00:05:08.389> still<00:05:08.660> actually

00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:08.930 
can program for both and still actually

00:05:08.930 --> 00:05:12.250 
can program for both and still actually
believe<00:05:09.680> it<00:05:09.830> or<00:05:09.949> not<00:05:11.050> increase<00:05:12.050> your

and<00:05:14.030> strength<00:05:14.120> you<00:05:14.510> just<00:05:14.539> have<00:05:14.870> to<00:05:15.020> be<00:05:15.139> smarter

00:05:15.670 --> 00:05:15.680 
and strength you just have to be smarter

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:18.040 
and strength you just have to be smarter
about<00:05:15.710> out<00:05:16.160> it<00:05:16.550> and<00:05:16.729> you<00:05:16.849> can't<00:05:17.150> use

00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:18.050 
about out it and you can't use
