where he's been and hopefully where he's

where he's been and hopefully where he's
going<00:00:31.140> it's<00:00:31.500> it's<00:00:31.740> definitely<00:00:32.160> more<00:00:32.250> fun<00:00:32.309> now

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:32.489 
going it's it's definitely more fun now

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:34.790 
going it's it's definitely more fun now
I<00:00:32.850> think<00:00:33.180> sports<00:00:33.570> in<00:00:33.719> general<00:00:33.870> it's<00:00:34.380> more<00:00:34.620> fun

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:34.800 
I think sports in general it's more fun

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:36.830 
I think sports in general it's more fun
when<00:00:34.829> you're<00:00:35.130> a<00:00:35.340> little<00:00:35.880> bit<00:00:36.000> better<00:00:36.149> than

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:36.840 
when you're a little bit better than

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:39.440 
when you're a little bit better than
when<00:00:36.989> you're<00:00:37.020> a<00:00:37.380> little<00:00:37.860> bit<00:00:38.100> worse<00:00:38.250> so<00:00:39.149> I

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:39.450 
when you're a little bit worse so I

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:41.510 
when you're a little bit worse so I
think<00:00:40.290> back<00:00:40.620> then<00:00:40.680> I<00:00:40.890> didn't<00:00:41.219> know<00:00:41.280> what<00:00:41.430> was

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:41.520 
think back then I didn't know what was

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:43.069 
think back then I didn't know what was
going<00:00:41.730> on<00:00:41.879> and<00:00:42.090> I<00:00:42.600> have<00:00:42.780> a<00:00:42.840> pretty<00:00:42.960> good

going on and I have a pretty good

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:44.810 
going on and I have a pretty good
understanding<00:00:43.170> now<00:00:43.739> but<00:00:44.190> no<00:00:44.309> matter<00:00:44.489> how<00:00:44.760> you

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:44.820
