00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:12.300 
code for the basic stamp which you are

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:13.850 
code for the basic stamp which you are
and<00:02:12.420> you<00:02:12.480> know<00:02:12.569> how<00:02:12.690> to<00:02:12.750> do<00:02:12.959> right

and you know how to do right

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:15.380 
and you know how to do right
and<00:02:13.950> once<00:02:14.100> you've<00:02:14.250> chosen<00:02:14.460> your<00:02:14.700> four<00:02:15.060> songs

it's<00:02:15.690> a<00:02:15.750> good<00:02:15.930> idea<00:02:16.080> to<00:02:16.350> code<00:02:16.770> each<00:02:17.040> song<00:02:17.370> in<00:02:17.580> a

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:17.670 
it's a good idea to code each song in a

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:19.760 
it's a good idea to code each song in a
separate<00:02:18.090> program<00:02:18.540> so<00:02:19.200> you<00:02:19.290> know<00:02:19.470> they<00:02:19.620> all

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:19.770 
separate program so you know they all

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:21.800 
separate program so you know they all
sound<00:02:20.100> right<00:02:20.400> before<00:02:20.730> you're<00:02:20.880> trying<00:02:21.120> to<00:02:21.210> mash

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:21.810 
sound right before you're trying to mash

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:24.010 
sound right before you're trying to mash
them<00:02:22.080> all<00:02:22.200> into<00:02:22.530> one<00:02:22.740> big<00:02:22.770> monster<00:02:23.400> program

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:24.020 
them all into one big monster program

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:26.570 
them all into one big monster program
now<00:02:25.020> you<00:02:25.110> can<00:02:25.470> benefit<00:02:25.830> off<00:02:26.010> of<00:02:26.040> the<00:02:26.250> fruits<00:02:26.460> of

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:34.170 
added a battery and ran the program it

00:02:34.170 --> 00:03:56.990 
added a battery and ran the program it
should<00:02:34.470> go<00:02:34.620> a<00:02:34.650> little<00:02:34.860> something<00:02:35.310> like<00:02:35.340> this
