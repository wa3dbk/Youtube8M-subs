00:00:12.259 --> 00:00:12.269 
beast gameplay but it definitely shows

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:15.950 
beast gameplay but it definitely shows
off<00:00:12.570> the<00:00:12.780> power<00:00:13.049> of<00:00:13.620> this<00:00:13.830> gun<00:00:14.330> the<00:00:15.330> type<00:00:15.570> 95

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:15.960 
off the power of this gun the type 95

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:20.420 
off the power of this gun the type 95
thermal<00:00:16.890> and<00:00:17.420> i<00:00:18.500> wasn't<00:00:19.500> sure<00:00:19.560> if<00:00:19.800> i<00:00:20.189> had

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:20.430 
thermal and i wasn't sure if i had

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:23.269 
thermal and i wasn't sure if i had
stability<00:00:20.850> i<00:00:21.539> think<00:00:22.260> its<00:00:22.380> stability<00:00:22.619> whatever

00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:23.279 
stability i think its stability whatever

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:28.160 
stability i think its stability whatever
the<00:00:23.430> final<00:00:23.699> the<00:00:24.570> final<00:00:25.080> i<00:00:26.869> don't<00:00:27.869> want<00:00:27.990> to<00:00:28.050> say

game that well over my commentary but I

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:51.439 
game that well over my commentary but I
do<00:00:47.010> leave<00:00:47.280> it<00:00:47.399> up<00:00:47.520> just<00:00:47.700> a<00:00:47.850> little<00:00:48.030> bit<00:00:48.860> but<00:00:50.449> I'm

00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:51.449 
do leave it up just a little bit but I'm

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:54.319 
do leave it up just a little bit but I'm
just<00:00:51.719> so<00:00:51.960> used<00:00:51.989> to<00:00:52.410> having<00:00:52.770> to<00:00:53.250> you<00:00:53.940> know<00:00:53.969> hold

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:54.329 
just so used to having to you know hold

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:59.240 
just so used to having to you know hold
it<00:00:54.539> in<00:00:54.750> where<00:00:55.469> I<00:00:55.500> hold<00:00:56.340> it<00:00:56.489> in<00:00:56.640> and<00:00:58.100> but<00:00:59.100> with

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
it in where I hold it in and but with

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:03.170 
it in where I hold it in and but with
stability<00:00:59.430> it's<00:00:59.910> like<00:01:00.059> there's<00:01:00.300> no<00:01:02.180> motion

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
stability it's like there's no motion

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:05.630 
stability it's like there's no motion
with<00:01:03.629> the<00:01:03.660> when<00:01:04.170> you're<00:01:04.320> down<00:01:04.769> like<00:01:05.070> a<00:01:05.400> cog

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
with the when you're down like a cog

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:09.910 
with the when you're down like a cog
side<00:01:05.909> of<00:01:06.090> the<00:01:06.180> thermal<00:01:06.570> thermal<00:01:07.110> scope<00:01:07.560> and

00:01:09.910 --> 00:01:09.920 

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:12.710 

it's<00:01:10.920> at<00:01:11.340> the<00:01:11.640> thermal<00:01:12.030> scopes<00:01:12.270> are<00:01:12.420> really

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
it's at the thermal scopes are really

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:16.070 
it's at the thermal scopes are really
good<00:01:12.869> in<00:01:12.900> this<00:01:13.049> game<00:01:13.460> but<00:01:14.460> it<00:01:15.270> just<00:01:15.420> takes<00:01:15.659> so

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 
good in this game but it just takes so

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:18.980 
good in this game but it just takes so
long<00:01:16.470> to<00:01:16.530> get<00:01:16.830> I<00:01:16.890> think<00:01:17.009> for<00:01:17.490> the<00:01:17.520> type<00:01:17.759> 95<00:01:18.090> it's

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
long to get I think for the type 95 it's

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:23.030 
long to get I think for the type 95 it's
like<00:01:19.259> weapon<00:01:20.159> level<00:01:20.490> 28<00:01:21.090> or<00:01:21.420> 29<00:01:21.740> which<00:01:22.740> is<00:01:22.920> like

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040 
like weapon level 28 or 29 which is like

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:27.020 
like weapon level 28 or 29 which is like
ridiculous<00:01:23.189> and<00:01:24.110> unfortunately<00:01:25.110> I<00:01:26.040> don't

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
ridiculous and unfortunately I don't

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:29.560 
ridiculous and unfortunately I don't
think<00:01:27.180> there's<00:01:27.450> a<00:01:27.509> way<00:01:27.659> you<00:01:27.689> can<00:01:27.990> let<00:01:28.140> keep<00:01:28.380> it

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:29.570 
think there's a way you can let keep it

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:32.480 
think there's a way you can let keep it
but<00:01:30.570> I<00:01:30.720> don't<00:01:30.930> know<00:01:30.990> there<00:01:31.200> might<00:01:31.380> be<00:01:31.439> like<00:01:31.950> I<00:01:31.979> I

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490 
but I don't know there might be like I I

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:34.580 
but I don't know there might be like I I
thought<00:01:33.090> about<00:01:33.329> one<00:01:33.509> life<00:01:33.720> prestiged<00:01:34.200> if<00:01:34.500> I

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
thought about one life prestiged if I

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:40.399 
thought about one life prestiged if I
kept<00:01:34.860> the<00:01:34.950> type<00:01:35.130> 95<00:01:35.520> and<00:01:36.119> then<00:01:36.630> in<00:01:37.110> the<00:01:38.009> next<00:01:39.409> in

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:40.409 
kept the type 95 and then in the next in

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:42.590 
kept the type 95 and then in the next in
the<00:01:41.130> next<00:01:41.159> prestige<00:01:41.790> would<00:01:42.000> I<00:01:42.090> be<00:01:42.270> able<00:01:42.390> to

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600 
the next prestige would I be able to

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:44.870 
the next prestige would I be able to
keep<00:01:42.810> the<00:01:43.079> UH<00:01:43.110> attachment<00:01:43.979> on<00:01:44.100> that<00:01:44.460> gun<00:01:44.670> I

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880 
keep the UH attachment on that gun I

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:48.499 
keep the UH attachment on that gun I
think<00:01:45.840> that's<00:01:46.049> kind<00:01:46.350> of<00:01:46.470> like<00:01:46.649> I<00:01:47.299> don't<00:01:48.299> know<00:01:48.479> I

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:48.509 
think that's kind of like I don't know I

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:50.120 
think that's kind of like I don't know I
think<00:01:48.630> that's<00:01:48.899> kind<00:01:49.079> of<00:01:49.140> stupid<00:01:49.350> how<00:01:49.590> how<00:01:49.979> they

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:22.920 
be a completely different game with like

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:25.850

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:29.730 
like that but I don't know this i mean

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:31.040 
like that but I don't know this i mean
if<00:02:29.970> you<00:02:30.060> guys<00:02:30.180> want<00:02:30.420> to<00:02:30.480> give<00:02:30.600> this<00:02:30.690> setup<00:02:30.900> a

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:31.050 
if you guys want to give this setup a

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:33.740 
if you guys want to give this setup a
try<00:02:31.290> it<00:02:31.560> took<00:02:31.980> me<00:02:32.040> a<00:02:32.190> little<00:02:32.400> bit<00:02:32.520> to<00:02:33.330> work<00:02:33.510> up

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:33.750 
try it took me a little bit to work up

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:36.230 
try it took me a little bit to work up
