00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:29.910 
corpses head so that's that sort of the

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:33.299 
corpses head so that's that sort of the
field<00:00:30.910> we<00:00:31.090> go<00:00:31.270> for<00:00:31.539> a<00:00:31.570> lot<00:00:31.890> the<00:00:32.890> corpses

00:00:33.299 --> 00:00:33.309 
field we go for a lot the corpses

00:00:33.309 --> 00:00:34.860 
field we go for a lot the corpses
basically<00:00:33.730> set<00:00:33.850> up<00:00:33.940> as<00:00:34.059> a<00:00:34.090> scavenging<00:00:34.690> node

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:34.870 
basically set up as a scavenging node

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:36.600 
basically set up as a scavenging node
which<00:00:35.350> is<00:00:35.500> a<00:00:35.530> type<00:00:35.800> of<00:00:35.860> which<00:00:36.130> is<00:00:36.250> part<00:00:36.430> of<00:00:36.489> our

crafting system you can interact with
different<00:00:38.649> types<00:00:38.920> of<00:00:39.010> nodes<00:00:39.220> to<00:00:39.550> get<00:00:39.670> items

00:00:39.990 --> 00:00:40.000 
different types of nodes to get items

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:41.250 
different types of nodes to get items
out<00:00:40.149> of<00:00:40.180> them<00:00:40.420> normally<00:00:40.780> you're<00:00:40.899> getting<00:00:41.140> like

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:41.260 
out of them normally you're getting like

00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:43.660 
raw materials and stuff like that so he

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:46.830 
raw materials and stuff like that so he
got<00:00:43.809> the<00:00:43.930> axe<00:00:44.079> and<00:00:44.820> when<00:00:45.820> you<00:00:45.940> want<00:00:46.480> to<00:00:46.570> use<00:00:46.809> a

FPS damage figured out via RPG mechanics

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:29.700 
FPS damage figured out via RPG mechanics
so<00:01:28.330> really<00:01:28.540> sort<00:01:28.810> of<00:01:28.840> going<00:01:29.049> for<00:01:29.200> a<00:01:29.229> hybrid<00:01:29.619> of

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:29.710 
so really sort of going for a hybrid of

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:31.920 
so really sort of going for a hybrid of
both<00:01:30.030> so<00:01:31.030> the<00:01:31.180> first<00:01:31.299> kill<00:01:31.630> in<00:01:31.720> the<00:01:31.750> game
