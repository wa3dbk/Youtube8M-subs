environment to what is a changing

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:46.279 
environment to what is a changing
outdoor<00:00:45.210> environment<00:00:45.899> where<00:00:46.050> you<00:00:46.140> may<00:00:46.260> have

cold<00:00:46.710> evenings<00:00:47.160> warmer<00:00:47.610> days<00:00:47.989> it<00:00:48.989> can

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140 
cold evenings warmer days it can

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:52.279 
cold evenings warmer days it can
actually<00:00:49.289> shock<00:00:49.860> the<00:00:50.129> plant<00:00:50.430> and<00:00:51.289> therefore

00:00:52.279 --> 00:00:52.289 
actually shock the plant and therefore

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:53.750 
actually shock the plant and therefore
and<00:00:52.530> then<00:00:52.620> it'll<00:00:52.829> either<00:00:52.949> die<00:00:53.280> or<00:00:53.309> will

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760 
and then it'll either die or will

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:56.090 
and then it'll either die or will
produce<00:00:54.000> as<00:00:54.390> well<00:00:54.600> so<00:00:55.320> what<00:00:55.530> you<00:00:55.559> want<00:00:55.829> to<00:00:55.920> do

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
produce as well so what you want to do

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:58.490 
produce as well so what you want to do
is<00:00:56.309> give<00:00:56.489> it<00:00:56.520> a<00:00:56.699> little<00:00:56.730> time<00:00:57.239> to<00:00:57.960> be<00:00:58.109> able<00:00:58.320> to

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
is give it a little time to be able to

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:00.650 
is give it a little time to be able to
get<00:00:58.859> used<00:00:59.039> to<00:00:59.190> the<00:00:59.370> outdoor<00:00:59.699> environment<00:01:00.359> so

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
get used to the outdoor environment so

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:02.779 
get used to the outdoor environment so
that<00:01:00.690> it'll<00:01:01.109> build<00:01:01.320> up<00:01:01.500> strengthen<00:01:02.070> it'll<00:01:02.340> be

00:01:02.779 --> 00:01:02.789 
that it'll build up strengthen it'll be

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:04.729 
that it'll build up strengthen it'll be
able<00:01:02.969> to<00:01:03.059> go<00:01:03.210> into<00:01:03.449> the<00:01:03.629> ground<00:01:03.750> or<00:01:04.080> into<00:01:04.110> a<00:01:04.409> pot

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:04.739 
able to go into the ground or into a pot

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:07.700 
able to go into the ground or into a pot
successfully<00:01:05.670> so<00:01:06.479> these<00:01:06.900> are<00:01:07.080> some<00:01:07.290> tomato

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
successfully so these are some tomato

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:10.609 
successfully so these are some tomato
seedlings<00:01:08.310> that<00:01:08.610> were<00:01:08.909> grown<00:01:09.450> that<00:01:10.170> I<00:01:10.260> got<00:01:10.439> at

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619 
seedlings that were grown that I got at

back in now this may seem kind of you

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:02.270 
back in now this may seem kind of you
know<00:02:00.149> troublesome<00:02:01.020> but<00:02:01.530> it's<00:02:01.710> really<00:02:02.130> the

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:02.280 
know troublesome but it's really the

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:04.580 
know troublesome but it's really the
best<00:02:02.399> way<00:02:02.640> to<00:02:02.790> harden<00:02:03.540> the<00:02:03.659> plants<00:02:04.079> off<00:02:04.259> so

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:04.590 
best way to harden the plants off so

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:06.350 
best way to harden the plants off so
that<00:02:04.770> way<00:02:04.950> they'll<00:02:05.159> be<00:02:05.219> successful<00:02:05.579> and

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:06.360 
that way they'll be successful and

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:09.619 
that way they'll be successful and
usually<00:02:07.049> by<00:02:07.229> about<00:02:07.259> four<00:02:07.979> days<00:02:08.190> or<00:02:08.520> so<00:02:08.759> they'll

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:09.629 
usually by about four days or so they'll

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:10.919 
usually by about four days or so they'll
have<00:02:09.660> gotten<00:02:10.200> used<00:02:10.470> to

00:02:10.919 --> 00:02:10.929 
have gotten used to

00:02:10.929 --> 00:02:13.470 
have gotten used to
the<00:02:11.260> environment<00:02:12.250> and<00:02:12.640> to<00:02:12.849> the<00:02:12.879> temperature

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:13.480 
the environment and to the temperature

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:15.300 
the environment and to the temperature
changes<00:02:14.079> and<00:02:14.109> then<00:02:14.409> you<00:02:14.439> can<00:02:14.680> go<00:02:14.799> ahead<00:02:15.129> and

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:15.310 
changes and then you can go ahead and

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:17.160 
changes and then you can go ahead and
plant<00:02:15.579> them<00:02:15.849> if<00:02:16.329> you<00:02:16.719> have<00:02:16.840> any<00:02:16.870> other
