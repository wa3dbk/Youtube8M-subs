between<00:00:47.309> the<00:00:47.430> Tom's<00:00:47.700> and<00:00:48.090> this<00:00:48.239> is<00:00:48.390> another

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.050 
between the Tom's and this is another

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:51.410 
between the Tom's and this is another
lesson<00:00:49.350> kind<00:00:49.739> of<00:00:49.829> in<00:00:49.950> that<00:00:50.039> vein<00:00:50.100> it's<00:00:50.969> a<00:00:51.120> sweep

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
lesson kind of in that vein it's a sweep

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:55.160 
lesson kind of in that vein it's a sweep
between<00:00:52.020> the<00:00:52.590> ride<00:00:52.949> and<00:00:53.340> the<00:00:53.610> snare<00:00:53.879> and<00:00:54.170> just

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170 
between the ride and the snare and just

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:57.650 
between the ride and the snare and just
as<00:00:55.379> all<00:00:55.890> the<00:00:56.039> other<00:00:56.190> ones<00:00:56.280> it's<00:00:56.760> really<00:00:57.390> simple

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
as all the other ones it's really simple

00:00:57.660 --> 00:00:59.720 
as all the other ones it's really simple
in<00:00:57.989> essence<00:00:58.410> it's<00:00:58.590> based<00:00:58.829> on<00:00:59.070> something<00:00:59.340> that

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730 
in essence it's based on something that

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:01.939 
in essence it's based on something that
every<00:01:00.629> drummer<00:01:00.870> should<00:01:01.109> be<00:01:01.199> able<00:01:01.440> to<00:01:01.530> do<00:01:01.680> and

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
every drummer should be able to do and

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:03.380 
every drummer should be able to do and
what<00:01:02.250> I'm<00:01:02.370> doing<00:01:02.640> with<00:01:02.760> that<00:01:02.850> is<00:01:03.000> I'm<00:01:03.149> just

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
what I'm doing with that is I'm just

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:07.070 
what I'm doing with that is I'm just
kind<00:01:04.379> of<00:01:04.559> twisting<00:01:05.250> it<00:01:05.369> in<00:01:05.549> a<00:01:05.820> in<00:01:06.150> a<00:01:06.330> small<00:01:06.840> way

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
kind of twisting it in a in a small way

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:08.570 
kind of twisting it in a in a small way
to<00:01:07.110> give<00:01:07.470> it<00:01:07.590> a<00:01:07.710> small<00:01:08.040> little<00:01:08.340> kind<00:01:08.520> of

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
to give it a small little kind of

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:11.090 
to give it a small little kind of
different<00:01:08.939> edge<00:01:09.090> and<00:01:09.390> so<00:01:09.710> like<00:01:10.710> I<00:01:10.799> said<00:01:10.860> it's

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100 
different edge and so like I said it's

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:12.679 
different edge and so like I said it's
based<00:01:11.280> on<00:01:11.400> something<00:01:11.670> super<00:01:12.000> simple<00:01:12.299> and<00:01:12.420> what

00:01:12.679 --> 00:01:12.689 
based on something super simple and what

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:14.630 
based on something super simple and what
it<00:01:12.810> is<00:01:12.930> based<00:01:13.170> on<00:01:13.409> is<00:01:13.590> just<00:01:13.799> a<00:01:13.920> double<00:01:14.310> stroke

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
it is based on is just a double stroke

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:16.550 
it is based on is just a double stroke
roll<00:01:14.869> right<00:01:15.869> right

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
roll right right

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:19.249 
roll right right
lift<00:01:16.799> lift<00:01:17.100> repeat<00:01:17.729> that's<00:01:18.600> pretty<00:01:18.930> much<00:01:19.049> what

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259 
lift lift repeat that's pretty much what

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:21.800 
lift lift repeat that's pretty much what
it's<00:01:19.380> based<00:01:19.560> on<00:01:19.740> so<00:01:20.509> obviously<00:01:21.509> this<00:01:21.659> goes

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
it's based on so obviously this goes

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:23.210 
it's based on so obviously this goes
without<00:01:21.990> saying<00:01:22.140> but<00:01:22.560> every<00:01:22.799> drummer<00:01:22.979> should

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:23.220 
without saying but every drummer should

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:25.730 
without saying but every drummer should
be<00:01:23.310> able<00:01:23.400> to<00:01:23.600> play<00:01:24.600> a<00:01:24.630> nice<00:01:24.869> clean<00:01:25.200> double

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 
be able to play a nice clean double

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:27.830 
be able to play a nice clean double
stroke<00:01:25.950> roll<00:01:25.979> maybe<00:01:26.909> I<00:01:27.030> shouldn't<00:01:27.330> say<00:01:27.630> that

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
stroke roll maybe I shouldn't say that

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:30.530 
stroke roll maybe I shouldn't say that
as<00:01:28.110> loudly<00:01:29.070> and<00:01:29.430> on<00:01:29.579> camera<00:01:29.970> as<00:01:30.030> I<00:01:30.150> just<00:01:30.329> did

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.540 
as loudly and on camera as I just did

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:32.390 
as loudly and on camera as I just did
because<00:01:30.750> I<00:01:30.960> don't<00:01:31.079> know<00:01:31.140> how<00:01:31.290> clean<00:01:31.560> my<00:01:31.829> double

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:32.400 
because I don't know how clean my double

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:33.679 
because I don't know how clean my double
stroke<00:01:32.579> rolls<00:01:32.790> are<00:01:32.970> but<00:01:33.240> it<00:01:33.360> is<00:01:33.479> something

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:33.689 
stroke rolls are but it is something

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:34.910 
stroke rolls are but it is something
that<00:01:33.900> I<00:01:33.960> have<00:01:34.079> been<00:01:34.200> working<00:01:34.500> on<00:01:34.590> I<00:01:34.619> promise

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920 
that I have been working on I promise

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:37.999 
that I have been working on I promise
but<00:01:35.790> in<00:01:36.000> working<00:01:36.299> on<00:01:36.570> this<00:01:37.049> technique<00:01:37.740> and<00:01:37.950> on

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:38.009 
but in working on this technique and on

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:39.649 
but in working on this technique and on
the<00:01:38.100> double<00:01:38.340> stroke<00:01:38.490> roll<00:01:38.549> I<00:01:38.850> started<00:01:39.450> kind<00:01:39.570> of

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:39.659 
the double stroke roll I started kind of

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:41.030 
the double stroke roll I started kind of
messing<00:01:39.960> around<00:01:40.049> the<00:01:40.350> kids<00:01:40.560> because<00:01:40.740> I<00:01:40.829> love

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:41.040 
messing around the kids because I love

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:42.530 
messing around the kids because I love
the<00:01:41.220> sweeps<00:01:41.460> I<00:01:41.640> don't<00:01:41.790> know<00:01:41.850> why<00:01:42.000> I<00:01:42.030> enjoy<00:01:42.360> them

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:42.540 
the sweeps I don't know why I enjoy them

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:44.719 
the sweeps I don't know why I enjoy them
so<00:01:42.780> much<00:01:42.990> and<00:01:43.290> I<00:01:43.799> think<00:01:43.829> that<00:01:44.040> one<00:01:44.460> of<00:01:44.549> the<00:01:44.610> main

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:44.729 
so much and I think that one of the main

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:46.190 
so much and I think that one of the main
reasons<00:01:45.060> why<00:01:45.149> I<00:01:45.180> like<00:01:45.360> the<00:01:45.509> sweeps<00:01:45.780> is<00:01:45.960> because

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
reasons why I like the sweeps is because

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:49.100 
reasons why I like the sweeps is because
it's<00:01:46.409> difficult<00:01:47.070> like<00:01:47.490> it's<00:01:47.670> a<00:01:47.850> it's<00:01:48.060> a<00:01:48.750> it's

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 
it's difficult like it's a it's a it's

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:51.080 
it's difficult like it's a it's a it's
difficult<00:01:49.530> to<00:01:49.920> extend<00:01:50.310> the<00:01:50.520> distance<00:01:50.670> that

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090 
difficult to extend the distance that

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:52.730 
difficult to extend the distance that
you're<00:01:51.210> trying<00:01:51.420> to<00:01:51.540> go<00:01:51.689> in<00:01:51.869> the<00:01:52.140> space<00:01:52.320> of<00:01:52.380> time

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:52.740 
you're trying to go in the space of time

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:54.740 
you're trying to go in the space of time
so<00:01:52.950> if<00:01:53.040> I'm<00:01:53.130> sweeping<00:01:53.579> in<00:01:53.700> between<00:01:54.000> the<00:01:54.479> Tom's

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750 
so if I'm sweeping in between the Tom's

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:56.569 
so if I'm sweeping in between the Tom's
and<00:01:54.930> the<00:01:54.960> snare<00:01:55.290> then<00:01:55.500> it's<00:01:55.979> it's<00:01:56.340> more

00:01:56.569 --> 00:01:56.579 
and the snare then it's it's more

00:01:56.579 --> 00:01:58.340 
and the snare then it's it's more
difficult<00:01:57.060> than<00:01:57.149> just<00:01:57.329> doing<00:01:57.540> this<00:01:57.719> you<00:01:58.229> know

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:58.350 
difficult than just doing this you know

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:00.950 
difficult than just doing this you know
like<00:01:58.710> doing<00:01:58.950> this<00:01:59.310> is<00:01:59.640> more<00:02:00.479> difficult<00:02:00.659> than

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:00.960 
like doing this is more difficult than

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:02.149 
like doing this is more difficult than
just<00:02:01.170> doing<00:02:01.320> this<00:02:01.469> and<00:02:01.649> I<00:02:01.680> figure<00:02:01.950> if<00:02:02.040> you're

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:02.159 
just doing this and I figure if you're

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:03.499 
just doing this and I figure if you're
able<00:02:02.399> to<00:02:02.430> do<00:02:02.579> the<00:02:02.700> more<00:02:02.880> difficult<00:02:03.299> things

00:02:03.499 --> 00:02:03.509 
able to do the more difficult things

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:05.719 
able to do the more difficult things
then<00:02:03.810> the<00:02:04.290> easier<00:02:04.680> things<00:02:04.950> would<00:02:05.159> be<00:02:05.310> much

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:05.729 
then the easier things would be much

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:09.080 
then the easier things would be much
easier<00:02:05.969> to<00:02:06.299> do<00:02:06.799> much<00:02:07.799> better<00:02:08.009> so<00:02:08.459> I<00:02:08.759> try<00:02:09.030> to

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:09.090 
easier to do much better so I try to

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:10.790 
easier to do much better so I try to
kind<00:02:09.360> of<00:02:09.390> push<00:02:09.539> myself<00:02:09.720> when<00:02:10.140> I<00:02:10.170> practice<00:02:10.590> and

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:10.800 
kind of push myself when I practice and

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:13.220 
kind of push myself when I practice and
this<00:02:11.160> is<00:02:11.310> one<00:02:11.459> of<00:02:11.489> the<00:02:11.640> reasons<00:02:11.910> why<00:02:12.090> I<00:02:12.450> started

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:13.230 
this is one of the reasons why I started

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:13.910 
this is one of the reasons why I started
messing<00:02:13.379> around<00:02:13.590> with

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:13.920 
messing around with

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:15.740 
messing around with
the<00:02:14.010> sweep<00:02:14.310> and<00:02:14.520> so<00:02:14.640> like<00:02:14.790> I<00:02:14.880> said<00:02:14.940> it's<00:02:15.390> based

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:15.750 
the sweep and so like I said it's based

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:18.260 
the sweep and so like I said it's based
on<00:02:16.080> that<00:02:16.860> one<00:02:17.010> stroke<00:02:17.190> girl<00:02:17.400> super<00:02:17.700> simple<00:02:18.030> the

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:18.270 
on that one stroke girl super simple the

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:19.970 
on that one stroke girl super simple the
double<00:02:18.599> stroke<00:02:18.810> roll<00:02:18.959> just<00:02:19.470> played<00:02:19.739> on<00:02:19.890> the

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:19.980 
double stroke roll just played on the

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:26.540 
double stroke roll just played on the
snare<00:02:20.220> sounds<00:02:20.670> like<00:02:20.760> this<00:02:24.650> and<00:02:25.650> so<00:02:25.890> that's<00:02:26.430> the

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:26.550 
snare sounds like this and so that's the

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:28.610 
snare sounds like this and so that's the
pattern<00:02:26.730> and<00:02:27.090> then<00:02:27.360> what<00:02:27.510> I<00:02:27.540> what<00:02:27.930> I<00:02:27.959> do<00:02:28.080> with

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:28.620 
pattern and then what I what I do with

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:30.860 
pattern and then what I what I do with
my<00:02:28.770> right<00:02:29.040> hand<00:02:29.370> is<00:02:29.550> the<00:02:30.270> two<00:02:30.450> notes<00:02:30.630> that<00:02:30.720> I'm

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:30.870 
my right hand is the two notes that I'm

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:34.330 
my right hand is the two notes that I'm
playing<00:02:31.050> with<00:02:31.140> my<00:02:31.200> right<00:02:31.500> hand<00:02:31.530> is<00:02:32.040> going<00:02:32.959> ride

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:34.340 
playing with my right hand is going ride

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:37.520 
playing with my right hand is going ride
snare<00:02:35.340> that's<00:02:36.150> all<00:02:36.569> that<00:02:36.900> is<00:02:37.020> so<00:02:37.230> instead<00:02:37.470> of

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:37.530 
snare that's all that is so instead of

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:40.070 
snare that's all that is so instead of
going<00:02:37.739> snare<00:02:38.580> snare<00:02:38.730> snare<00:02:39.270> snare<00:02:39.690> snare

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:40.080 
going snare snare snare snare snare

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:43.220 
going snare snare snare snare snare
snares<00:02:40.800> there's<00:02:41.100> there<00:02:41.489> I'm<00:02:42.030> going<00:02:42.450> rides

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:43.230 
snares there's there I'm going rides

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:46.160 
snares there's there I'm going rides
there's<00:02:43.709> snares<00:02:44.130> now<00:02:44.459> wide<00:02:44.970> snare<00:02:45.390> snares<00:02:45.810> now

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:46.170 
there's snares now wide snare snares now

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:48.620 
there's snares now wide snare snares now
ride<00:02:46.620> snare<00:02:47.040> snare<00:02:47.310> so<00:02:47.970> it's<00:02:48.120> really<00:02:48.390> simple

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:48.630 
ride snare snare so it's really simple

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:51.259 
ride snare snare so it's really simple
exactly<00:02:49.620> the<00:02:49.739> same<00:02:49.950> pattern<00:02:50.160> but<00:02:50.550> like<00:02:50.940> I<00:02:51.060> said

00:02:51.259 --> 00:02:51.269 
exactly the same pattern but like I said

00:02:51.269 --> 00:02:53.570 
exactly the same pattern but like I said
what<00:02:51.390> I<00:02:51.420> started<00:02:51.810> doing<00:02:51.870> was<00:02:52.140> I<00:02:52.319> went<00:02:52.769> how<00:02:53.280> can

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:53.580 
what I started doing was I went how can

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:54.680 
what I started doing was I went how can
I<00:02:53.610> make<00:02:53.819> this<00:02:53.940> more<00:02:54.120> difficult<00:02:54.150> for<00:02:54.540> myself

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:54.690 
I make this more difficult for myself

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:57.410 
I make this more difficult for myself
how<00:02:55.080> can<00:02:55.290> I<00:02:55.410> force<00:02:55.830> my<00:02:56.040> hands<00:02:56.430> to<00:02:56.940> be<00:02:57.090> more

00:02:57.410 --> 00:02:57.420 
how can I force my hands to be more

00:02:57.420 --> 00:02:59.660 
how can I force my hands to be more
relaxed<00:02:57.989> and<00:02:58.110> more<00:02:58.260> fluid<00:02:58.769> and<00:02:58.980> what<00:02:59.549> I<00:02:59.580> came

00:02:59.660 --> 00:02:59.670 
relaxed and more fluid and what I came

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:02.330 
relaxed and more fluid and what I came
up<00:02:59.819> with<00:03:00.000> long<00:03:00.900> ago<00:03:01.200> was<00:03:01.440> the<00:03:01.590> notion<00:03:01.739> of<00:03:02.040> then

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:02.340 
up with long ago was the notion of then

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:04.009 
up with long ago was the notion of then
extending<00:03:02.910> the<00:03:03.000> distance<00:03:03.420> so<00:03:03.600> if<00:03:03.690> I<00:03:03.810> want<00:03:03.989> to

00:03:04.009 --> 00:03:04.019 
extending the distance so if I want to

00:03:04.019 --> 00:03:06.470 
extending the distance so if I want to
sweep<00:03:04.549> between<00:03:05.549> the<00:03:05.640> Tom's<00:03:05.910> and<00:03:06.090> the<00:03:06.209> snare

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:06.480 
sweep between the Tom's and the snare

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:08.120 
sweep between the Tom's and the snare
then<00:03:06.660> obviously<00:03:06.810> I<00:03:07.049> have<00:03:07.170> to<00:03:07.260> be<00:03:07.380> more<00:03:07.560> relaxed

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:08.130 
then obviously I have to be more relaxed

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:09.830 
then obviously I have to be more relaxed
because<00:03:08.400> otherwise<00:03:08.610> this<00:03:09.330> will<00:03:09.510> become

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:09.840 
because otherwise this will become

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:12.080 
because otherwise this will become
really<00:03:10.290> difficult<00:03:10.590> to<00:03:10.980> do<00:03:11.100> and<00:03:11.280> so<00:03:11.519> what<00:03:12.060> I

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:12.090 
really difficult to do and so what I

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:13.910 
really difficult to do and so what I
started<00:03:12.180> forcing<00:03:12.720> myself<00:03:12.840> to<00:03:13.110> do<00:03:13.350> was<00:03:13.590> to<00:03:13.739> kind

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:13.920 
started forcing myself to do was to kind

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:16.640 
started forcing myself to do was to kind
of<00:03:13.950> go<00:03:14.160> to<00:03:14.600> further<00:03:15.600> out<00:03:15.840> on<00:03:15.870> the<00:03:16.170> kit<00:03:16.410> then

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:16.650 
of go to further out on the kit then

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:18.080 
of go to further out on the kit then
just<00:03:16.980> hang<00:03:17.190> on<00:03:17.280> the<00:03:17.370> snare<00:03:17.580> and<00:03:17.610> so<00:03:17.880> that's

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:18.090 
just hang on the snare and so that's

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:20.660 
just hang on the snare and so that's
exactly<00:03:18.510> why<00:03:18.660> I<00:03:18.690> started<00:03:19.290> doing<00:03:19.500> this<00:03:19.620> so<00:03:19.920> in

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:20.670 
exactly why I started doing this so in

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:22.009 
exactly why I started doing this so in
order<00:03:20.790> to<00:03:20.910> do<00:03:21.090> this<00:03:21.209> you're<00:03:21.420> right<00:03:21.570> and<00:03:21.810> needs

00:03:22.009 --> 00:03:22.019 
order to do this you're right and needs

00:03:22.019 --> 00:03:24.319 
order to do this you're right and needs
to<00:03:22.079> be<00:03:22.200> really<00:03:22.920> relaxed<00:03:23.430> like<00:03:23.609> you<00:03:23.760> can't<00:03:24.000> grip

00:03:24.319 --> 00:03:24.329 
to be really relaxed like you can't grip

00:03:24.329 --> 00:03:25.910 
to be really relaxed like you can't grip
the<00:03:24.510> stick<00:03:24.720> like<00:03:25.290> a<00:03:25.320> caveman

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:25.920 
the stick like a caveman

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:29.000 
the stick like a caveman
you<00:03:26.790> can't<00:03:27.030> even<00:03:27.239> like<00:03:27.570> grip<00:03:28.230> it<00:03:28.380> tightly<00:03:28.739> even

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:29.010 
you can't even like grip it tightly even

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:30.530 
you can't even like grip it tightly even
if<00:03:29.250> it's<00:03:29.400> if<00:03:29.609> you're<00:03:29.820> normal<00:03:30.209> kind<00:03:30.329> of<00:03:30.420> loose

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:30.540 
if it's if you're normal kind of loose

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:32.420 
if it's if you're normal kind of loose
grip<00:03:30.750> you<00:03:30.870> can't<00:03:31.079> like<00:03:31.500> squeeze<00:03:31.950> on<00:03:32.100> the<00:03:32.220> stick

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:32.430 
grip you can't like squeeze on the stick

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:35.180 
grip you can't like squeeze on the stick
it<00:03:32.579> needs<00:03:32.760> to<00:03:32.880> be<00:03:33.000> really<00:03:33.630> smooth<00:03:34.019> and<00:03:34.350> fluid

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:35.190 
it needs to be really smooth and fluid

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:36.890 
it needs to be really smooth and fluid
and<00:03:35.310> you<00:03:35.400> need<00:03:35.579> to<00:03:35.670> be<00:03:35.790> like<00:03:36.000> you<00:03:36.570> need<00:03:36.720> to<00:03:36.810> have

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:36.900 
and you need to be like you need to have

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:38.479 
and you need to be like you need to have
a<00:03:36.930> nice<00:03:37.170> relaxed<00:03:37.739> grip<00:03:37.859> on<00:03:38.040> the<00:03:38.130> stick<00:03:38.340> if<00:03:38.459> you

00:03:38.479 --> 00:03:38.489 
a nice relaxed grip on the stick if you

00:03:38.489 --> 00:03:41.690 
a nice relaxed grip on the stick if you
want<00:03:38.700> to<00:03:38.790> travel<00:03:39.090> this<00:03:39.690> distance<00:03:40.310> at<00:03:41.310> that

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:41.700 
want to travel this distance at that

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:43.550 
want to travel this distance at that
speed<00:03:42.090> and<00:03:42.329> so<00:03:42.600> that's<00:03:42.959> what<00:03:43.170> I<00:03:43.200> kind<00:03:43.440> of

00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:43.560 
speed and so that's what I kind of

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:44.900 
speed and so that's what I kind of
started<00:03:43.859> doing<00:03:44.100> with<00:03:44.220> regards<00:03:44.519> to<00:03:44.549> that<00:03:44.760> and

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:44.910 
started doing with regards to that and

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:47.449 
started doing with regards to that and
you'll<00:03:45.000> see<00:03:45.239> when<00:03:45.870> I<00:03:45.900> do<00:03:46.019> this<00:03:46.410> motion<00:03:46.890> the<00:03:47.220> the

00:03:47.449 --> 00:03:47.459 
you'll see when I do this motion the the

00:03:47.459 --> 00:03:49.009 
you'll see when I do this motion the the
what<00:03:47.609> is<00:03:47.730> happening<00:03:48.150> with<00:03:48.239> my<00:03:48.390> hand<00:03:48.630> it's<00:03:48.840> the

00:03:49.009 --> 00:03:49.019 
what is happening with my hand it's the

00:03:49.019 --> 00:03:50.990 
what is happening with my hand it's the
circular<00:03:49.620> motion<00:03:50.040> especially<00:03:50.670> from<00:03:50.820> that

00:03:50.990 --> 00:03:51.000 
circular motion especially from that

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.270 
circular motion especially from that
angle<00:03:51.150> like<00:03:51.480> you'll<00:03:51.630> see<00:03:51.840> if<00:03:52.079> I'm<00:03:52.500> doing<00:03:52.829> this

00:03:53.270 --> 00:03:53.280 
angle like you'll see if I'm doing this

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:55.039 
angle like you'll see if I'm doing this
this<00:03:53.640> double<00:03:53.940> circ<00:03:54.090> sweep<00:03:54.420> what's<00:03:54.690> happening

00:03:55.039 --> 00:03:55.049 
this double circ sweep what's happening

00:03:55.049 --> 00:03:56.180 
this double circ sweep what's happening
with<00:03:55.170> my<00:03:55.290> right<00:03:55.470> hand<00:03:55.650> is<00:03:55.739> I'm<00:03:55.859> doing<00:03:56.070> this

00:03:56.180 --> 00:03:56.190 
with my right hand is I'm doing this

00:03:56.190 --> 00:03:58.910 
with my right hand is I'm doing this
kind<00:03:56.340> of<00:03:56.459> circular<00:03:57.209> motion<00:03:57.780> because<00:03:57.810> it's<00:03:58.650> it

00:03:58.910 --> 00:03:58.920 
kind of circular motion because it's it

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:01.520 
kind of circular motion because it's it
needs<00:03:59.130> to<00:03:59.220> be<00:03:59.310> one<00:03:59.609> motion<00:04:00.180> it<00:04:00.420> can't<00:04:00.630> be<00:04:00.840> ride

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:01.530 
needs to be one motion it can't be ride

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:03.770 
needs to be one motion it can't be ride
snare<00:04:02.250> again<00:04:02.850> I'm<00:04:02.940> gonna<00:04:03.030> go<00:04:03.180> back<00:04:03.480> to<00:04:03.510> the

00:04:03.770 --> 00:04:03.780 
snare again I'm gonna go back to the

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:06.590 
snare again I'm gonna go back to the
ride<00:04:03.959> snare<00:04:04.769> back<00:04:05.519> to<00:04:05.700> the<00:04:05.790> ride<00:04:05.940> that's<00:04:06.329> so

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:06.600 
ride snare back to the ride that's so

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:08.150 
ride snare back to the ride that's so
much<00:04:06.720> more<00:04:06.900> tedious<00:04:07.260> than<00:04:07.319> just<00:04:07.650> having<00:04:08.069> a

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:08.160 
much more tedious than just having a

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:10.309 
much more tedious than just having a
circle<00:04:08.609> they<00:04:08.790> continues<00:04:09.299> and<00:04:09.870> I<00:04:09.959> that's<00:04:10.200> just

00:04:10.309 --> 00:04:10.319 
circle they continues and I that's just

00:04:10.319 --> 00:04:11.720 
circle they continues and I that's just
how<00:04:10.500> my<00:04:10.680> head<00:04:10.889> works<00:04:11.100> and<00:04:11.310> I<00:04:11.340> think<00:04:11.549> that's

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:11.730 
how my head works and I think that's

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:13.160 
how my head works and I think that's
just<00:04:11.880> how<00:04:12.030> the<00:04:12.090> human<00:04:12.420> body<00:04:12.569> works<00:04:12.870> like<00:04:13.079> you

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:13.170 
just how the human body works like you

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:15.140 
just how the human body works like you
want<00:04:13.350> to<00:04:13.440> streamline<00:04:13.859> that<00:04:14.010> motion<00:04:14.250> you<00:04:14.970> want

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:15.150 
want to streamline that motion you want

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:19.430 
want to streamline that motion you want
to<00:04:15.239> get<00:04:15.389> it<00:04:15.510> to<00:04:15.630> be<00:04:16.340> less<00:04:17.340> energy<00:04:18.440> consumption

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:19.440 
to get it to be less energy consumption

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:21.770 
to get it to be less energy consumption
more<00:04:19.859> energy<00:04:20.250> efficient<00:04:20.669> and<00:04:20.910> just<00:04:20.940> simpler

00:04:21.770 --> 00:04:21.780 
more energy efficient and just simpler

00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:23.240 
more energy efficient and just simpler
to<00:04:21.930> execute<00:04:22.289> this<00:04:22.440> so<00:04:22.620> what<00:04:22.800> I<00:04:22.830> came<00:04:23.070> up<00:04:23.220> with

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:23.250 
to execute this so what I came up with

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:24.950 
to execute this so what I came up with
like<00:04:23.580> I<00:04:23.669> said<00:04:23.880> was<00:04:24.090> just<00:04:24.150> to<00:04:24.419> split<00:04:24.630> up<00:04:24.810> that

00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:24.960 
like I said was just to split up that

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:27.560 
like I said was just to split up that
that<00:04:25.380> right<00:04:26.159> hand<00:04:26.430> double<00:04:26.789> stroke

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:27.570 
that right hand double stroke

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:29.690 
that right hand double stroke
instead<00:04:27.750> of<00:04:27.840> going<00:04:28.040> theorems<00:04:29.040> going<00:04:29.310> rights

00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:29.700 
instead of going theorems going rights

00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:31.850 
instead of going theorems going rights
there<00:04:30.000> and<00:04:30.180> as<00:04:31.140> you<00:04:31.350> might<00:04:31.470> have<00:04:31.560> heard<00:04:31.710> in<00:04:31.740> the

00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:31.860 
there and as you might have heard in the

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:33.860 
there and as you might have heard in the
intro<00:04:32.100> what<00:04:32.310> I<00:04:32.340> do<00:04:32.430> with<00:04:33.060> the<00:04:33.300> kick<00:04:33.510> is<00:04:33.720> that

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:33.870 
intro what I do with the kick is that

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:37.820 
intro what I do with the kick is that
just<00:04:34.050> accent<00:04:34.680> that<00:04:35.280> note<00:04:35.640> on<00:04:36.230> the<00:04:37.230> ride<00:04:37.380> with

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:37.830 
just accent that note on the ride with

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:40.040 
just accent that note on the ride with
the<00:04:37.860> kick<00:04:38.400> so<00:04:38.910> it<00:04:39.450> just<00:04:39.630> gives<00:04:39.780> it<00:04:39.900> more

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:40.050 
the kick so it just gives it more

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:41.360 
the kick so it just gives it more
definition<00:04:40.170> otherwise<00:04:40.740> it<00:04:40.980> sounds<00:04:41.280> like

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:41.370 
definition otherwise it sounds like

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:42.770 
definition otherwise it sounds like
there's<00:04:41.550> an<00:04:41.670> empty<00:04:41.910> hole<00:04:42.060> especially<00:04:42.630> because

00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:42.780 
there's an empty hole especially because

00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:45.200 
there's an empty hole especially because
the<00:04:43.530> ride<00:04:43.740> isn't<00:04:43.950> as<00:04:44.160> loud<00:04:44.340> as<00:04:44.580> the<00:04:44.730> snare<00:04:44.970> so

00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:45.210 
the ride isn't as loud as the snare so

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:47.180 
the ride isn't as loud as the snare so
what<00:04:45.780> I<00:04:45.810> do<00:04:45.930> is<00:04:46.290> I<00:04:46.470> just<00:04:46.620> do<00:04:46.680> exactly<00:04:47.010> what<00:04:47.130> I

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:47.190 
what I do is I just do exactly what I

00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:50.210 
what I do is I just do exactly what I
just<00:04:47.340> explained<00:04:47.790> ride<00:04:48.660> snare<00:04:49.260> snare<00:04:49.680> snare

00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:50.220 
just explained ride snare snare snare

00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:53.660 
just explained ride snare snare snare
ride<00:04:50.940> snare<00:04:51.540> Stan<00:04:52.080> snare<00:04:52.530> but<00:04:53.100> I<00:04:53.130> just<00:04:53.400> hit<00:04:53.550> the

00:04:53.660 --> 00:04:53.670 
ride snare Stan snare but I just hit the

00:04:53.670 --> 00:04:57.440 
ride snare Stan snare but I just hit the
kick<00:04:53.880> on<00:04:54.480> every<00:04:55.140> single<00:04:55.320> ride<00:04:55.710> struck<00:04:56.250> so<00:04:56.850> I'm

00:04:57.440 --> 00:04:57.450 
kick on every single ride struck so I'm

00:04:57.450 --> 00:05:00.200 
kick on every single ride struck so I'm
gonna<00:04:57.600> start<00:04:57.870> at<00:04:58.110> a<00:04:58.410> kind<00:04:59.070> of<00:04:59.190> fast

00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:00.210 
gonna start at a kind of fast

00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:01.550 
gonna start at a kind of fast
ish<00:05:00.330> tempo<00:05:00.810> and<00:05:00.990> then<00:05:01.050> I'll<00:05:01.170> just<00:05:01.350> slow<00:05:01.530> it

00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:01.560 
ish tempo and then I'll just slow it

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:03.020 
ish tempo and then I'll just slow it
down<00:05:01.710> as<00:05:01.980> slow<00:05:02.160> as<00:05:02.310> I<00:05:02.400> can<00:05:02.430> get<00:05:02.730> it<00:05:02.850> without

00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:03.030 
down as slow as I can get it without

00:05:03.030 --> 00:05:05.900 
down as slow as I can get it without
losing<00:05:03.300> complete<00:05:03.990> control<00:05:04.170> and<00:05:04.760> I'll<00:05:05.760> play

00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:05.910 
losing complete control and I'll play

00:05:05.910 --> 00:05:07.130 
losing complete control and I'll play
the<00:05:06.030> bass<00:05:06.180> and<00:05:06.210> just<00:05:06.510> as<00:05:06.600> I<00:05:06.690> played<00:05:06.900> it<00:05:07.020> in<00:05:07.080> the

00:05:07.130 --> 00:05:07.140 
the bass and just as I played it in the

00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:09.500 
the bass and just as I played it in the
intro<00:05:07.440> with<00:05:07.710> including<00:05:08.520> the<00:05:08.610> kick<00:05:08.790> and<00:05:09.030> then

00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:09.510 
intro with including the kick and then

00:05:09.510 --> 00:05:10.730 
intro with including the kick and then
I'll<00:05:09.600> just<00:05:09.750> try<00:05:09.900> and<00:05:09.960> slow<00:05:10.170> down<00:05:10.200> so<00:05:10.530> you<00:05:10.620> can

00:05:10.730 --> 00:05:10.740 
I'll just try and slow down so you can

00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:12.710 
I'll just try and slow down so you can
see<00:05:10.950> kind<00:05:11.520> of<00:05:11.610> what<00:05:11.790> that<00:05:11.940> motion<00:05:12.150> looks<00:05:12.510> like

00:05:12.710 --> 00:05:12.720 
see kind of what that motion looks like

00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:15.470 
see kind of what that motion looks like
and<00:05:12.960> why<00:05:13.200> and<00:05:13.710> why<00:05:14.430> started<00:05:15.090> doing<00:05:15.240> this<00:05:15.330> in

00:05:15.470 --> 00:05:15.480 
and why and why started doing this in

00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:17.480 
and why and why started doing this in
the<00:05:15.510> first<00:05:15.750> place<00:05:15.960> which<00:05:16.320> is<00:05:16.350> to<00:05:16.560> relax<00:05:16.980> my

00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:17.490 
the first place which is to relax my

00:05:17.490 --> 00:05:18.860 
the first place which is to relax my
right<00:05:17.670> hand<00:05:17.910> so<00:05:18.150> that's<00:05:18.330> this<00:05:18.510> is<00:05:18.630> what<00:05:18.780> the

00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:18.870 
right hand so that's this is what the

00:05:18.870 --> 00:05:21.710 
right hand so that's this is what the
pattern<00:05:19.170> looks<00:05:19.200> like<00:05:19.530> at<00:05:20.330> regular<00:05:21.330> speed<00:05:21.390> and

00:05:21.710 --> 00:05:21.720 
pattern looks like at regular speed and

00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:50.480 
pattern looks like at regular speed and
then<00:05:21.810> slow<00:05:22.020> down<00:05:48.380> so<00:05:49.380> you'll<00:05:49.500> see<00:05:49.680> like<00:05:50.130> I<00:05:50.250> said

00:05:50.480 --> 00:05:50.490 
then slow down so you'll see like I said

00:05:50.490 --> 00:05:52.370 
then slow down so you'll see like I said
in<00:05:50.730> essence<00:05:51.330> this<00:05:51.450> is<00:05:51.600> super<00:05:51.840> simple<00:05:51.990> just

00:05:52.370 --> 00:05:52.380 
in essence this is super simple just

00:05:52.380 --> 00:05:54.320 
in essence this is super simple just
based<00:05:52.560> on<00:05:52.680> a<00:05:52.740> double<00:05:53.070> stroke<00:05:53.250> roll<00:05:53.370> and<00:05:54.030> what<00:05:54.300> I

00:05:54.320 --> 00:05:54.330 
based on a double stroke roll and what I

00:05:54.330 --> 00:05:56.090 
based on a double stroke roll and what I
would<00:05:54.510> advise<00:05:54.840> if<00:05:55.290> you<00:05:55.620> kind<00:05:55.830> of<00:05:55.920> want<00:05:56.040> to

00:05:56.090 --> 00:05:56.100 
would advise if you kind of want to

00:05:56.100 --> 00:05:57.470 
would advise if you kind of want to
start<00:05:56.250> dabbling<00:05:56.490> with<00:05:56.670> stuff<00:05:56.940> like<00:05:57.120> this<00:05:57.240> I

00:05:57.470 --> 00:05:57.480 
start dabbling with stuff like this I

00:05:57.480 --> 00:05:59.720 
start dabbling with stuff like this I
kind<00:05:57.660> of<00:05:57.720> start<00:05:57.960> pushing<00:05:58.320> yourself<00:05:58.670> I'm<00:05:59.670> not

00:05:59.720 --> 00:05:59.730 
kind of start pushing yourself I'm not

00:05:59.730 --> 00:06:01.460 
kind of start pushing yourself I'm not
saying<00:06:00.090> this<00:06:00.180> is<00:06:00.360> so<00:06:00.720> ridiculously<00:06:01.290> difficult

00:06:01.460 --> 00:06:01.470 
saying this is so ridiculously difficult

00:06:01.470 --> 00:06:03.020 
saying this is so ridiculously difficult
that<00:06:01.830> you<00:06:01.950> have<00:06:02.100> to<00:06:02.220> push<00:06:02.520> yourself<00:06:02.640> really

00:06:03.020 --> 00:06:03.030 
that you have to push yourself really

00:06:03.030 --> 00:06:04.820 
that you have to push yourself really
hard<00:06:03.240> but<00:06:03.450> for<00:06:03.810> me<00:06:03.960> this<00:06:04.140> was<00:06:04.200> outside<00:06:04.530> of<00:06:04.770> my

00:06:04.820 --> 00:06:04.830 
hard but for me this was outside of my

00:06:04.830 --> 00:06:06.110 
hard but for me this was outside of my
comfort<00:06:05.010> zone<00:06:05.160> when<00:06:05.430> I<00:06:05.490> started<00:06:05.760> going<00:06:05.970> into

00:06:06.110 --> 00:06:06.120 
comfort zone when I started going into

00:06:06.120 --> 00:06:08.000 
comfort zone when I started going into
this<00:06:06.270> direction<00:06:06.510> and<00:06:07.020> if<00:06:07.440> you<00:06:07.590> want<00:06:07.770> to<00:06:07.830> start

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:08.010 
this direction and if you want to start

00:06:08.010 --> 00:06:10.850 
this direction and if you want to start
doing<00:06:08.130> that<00:06:08.340> what<00:06:08.550> I<00:06:08.580> can<00:06:08.790> advise<00:06:09.060> is<00:06:09.860> started

00:06:10.850 --> 00:06:10.860 
doing that what I can advise is started

00:06:10.860 --> 00:06:12.470 
doing that what I can advise is started
doing<00:06:11.130> that<00:06:11.220> with<00:06:11.370> your<00:06:11.520> left<00:06:11.640> hand<00:06:11.880> which<00:06:12.180> I'm

00:06:12.470 --> 00:06:12.480

00:06:12.480 --> 00:06:14.450 
doing that with your left hand which I'm
working<00:06:13.050> on<00:06:13.170> but<00:06:13.590> I'm<00:06:13.800> not<00:06:13.920> gonna<00:06:14.070> put<00:06:14.250> that<00:06:14.280> on

00:06:14.450 --> 00:06:14.460 
working on but I'm not gonna put that on

00:06:14.460 --> 00:06:16.100 
working on but I'm not gonna put that on
video<00:06:14.760> because<00:06:15.000> I<00:06:15.090> still<00:06:15.210> suck<00:06:15.540> at<00:06:15.570> it<00:06:15.840> but

00:06:16.100 --> 00:06:16.110 
video because I still suck at it but

00:06:16.110 --> 00:06:18.770 
video because I still suck at it but
I've<00:06:16.680> started<00:06:17.010> dabbling<00:06:17.310> with<00:06:17.550> doing<00:06:18.330> exactly

00:06:18.770 --> 00:06:18.780 
I've started dabbling with doing exactly

00:06:18.780 --> 00:06:22.220 
I've started dabbling with doing exactly
the<00:06:18.960> same<00:06:19.170> pattern<00:06:19.350> but<00:06:20.540> like<00:06:21.540> splitting<00:06:22.110> on

00:06:22.220 --> 00:06:22.230 
the same pattern but like splitting on

00:06:22.230 --> 00:06:24.470 
the same pattern but like splitting on
both<00:06:22.380> hands<00:06:22.620> between<00:06:22.950> whatever<00:06:23.790> else<00:06:24.180> I<00:06:24.300> want

00:06:24.470 --> 00:06:24.480 
both hands between whatever else I want

00:06:24.480 --> 00:06:25.550 
both hands between whatever else I want
to<00:06:24.540> hit<00:06:24.630> and<00:06:24.870> the<00:06:24.990> snare<00:06:25.200> that<00:06:25.230> I'm<00:06:25.380> always

00:06:25.550 --> 00:06:25.560 
to hit and the snare that I'm always

00:06:25.560 --> 00:06:26.900 
to hit and the snare that I'm always
coming<00:06:25.860> back<00:06:26.040> to<00:06:26.190> the<00:06:26.310> snare<00:06:26.490> drum<00:06:26.730> that's

00:06:26.900 --> 00:06:26.910 
coming back to the snare drum that's

00:06:26.910 --> 00:06:28.190 
coming back to the snare drum that's
kind<00:06:27.120> of<00:06:27.180> what<00:06:27.330> I'm<00:06:27.420> working<00:06:27.720> on<00:06:27.780> now<00:06:27.990> and

00:06:28.190 --> 00:06:28.200 
kind of what I'm working on now and

00:06:28.200 --> 00:06:30.140 
kind of what I'm working on now and
another<00:06:28.920> thing<00:06:29.220> that's<00:06:29.610> the<00:06:29.850> one<00:06:29.970> thing<00:06:30.090> you

00:06:30.140 --> 00:06:30.150 
another thing that's the one thing you

00:06:30.150 --> 00:06:31.940 
another thing that's the one thing you
can<00:06:30.360> do<00:06:30.480> start<00:06:30.750> using<00:06:31.290> your<00:06:31.470> left<00:06:31.650> hand<00:06:31.710> and

00:06:31.940 --> 00:06:31.950 
can do start using your left hand and

00:06:31.950 --> 00:06:33.470 
can do start using your left hand and
another<00:06:32.070> thing<00:06:32.400> that<00:06:32.520> you<00:06:32.610> can<00:06:32.700> do<00:06:32.850> is<00:06:33.030> go

00:06:33.470 --> 00:06:33.480 
another thing that you can do is go

00:06:33.480 --> 00:06:34.040 
another thing that you can do is go
further

00:06:34.040 --> 00:06:34.050 
further

00:06:34.050 --> 00:06:36.590 
further
so<00:06:34.320> obviously<00:06:35.100> this<00:06:35.310> distance<00:06:35.790> makes<00:06:36.450> it

00:06:36.590 --> 00:06:36.600 
so obviously this distance makes it

00:06:36.600 --> 00:06:38.060 
so obviously this distance makes it
quite<00:06:36.750> tricky<00:06:36.930> especially<00:06:37.169> if<00:06:37.680> you're<00:06:37.860> trying

00:06:38.060 --> 00:06:38.070 
quite tricky especially if you're trying

00:06:38.070 --> 00:06:39.500 
quite tricky especially if you're trying
to<00:06:38.160> hit<00:06:38.310> the<00:06:38.400> middle<00:06:38.730> of<00:06:38.790> the<00:06:38.910> snare<00:06:39.120> drum<00:06:39.330> on

00:06:39.500 --> 00:06:39.510 
to hit the middle of the snare drum on

00:06:39.510 --> 00:06:41.510 
to hit the middle of the snare drum on
every<00:06:40.020> iteration<00:06:40.230> but<00:06:40.710> what<00:06:41.220> you<00:06:41.310> can<00:06:41.430> start

00:06:41.510 --> 00:06:41.520 
every iteration but what you can start

00:06:41.520 --> 00:06:42.020 
every iteration but what you can start
doing

00:06:42.020 --> 00:06:42.030 
doing

00:06:42.030 --> 00:06:43.700 
doing
going<00:06:42.270> further<00:06:42.630> away<00:06:42.750> from<00:06:43.020> the<00:06:43.320> snare<00:06:43.560> with

00:06:43.700 --> 00:06:43.710 
going further away from the snare with

00:06:43.710 --> 00:06:46.340 
going further away from the snare with
regards<00:06:44.040> to<00:06:44.190> maybe<00:06:44.400> hitting<00:06:44.640> a<00:06:45.030> crash<00:06:45.510> like

00:06:46.340 --> 00:06:46.350 
regards to maybe hitting a crash like

00:06:46.350 --> 00:06:47.870 
regards to maybe hitting a crash like
that<00:06:46.500> or<00:06:46.770> doing<00:06:47.010> the<00:06:47.160> double<00:06:47.430> stroke<00:06:47.610> sweep

00:06:47.870 --> 00:06:47.880 
that or doing the double stroke sweep

00:06:47.880 --> 00:06:49.070 
that or doing the double stroke sweep
with<00:06:48.180> regards<00:06:48.450> to<00:06:48.510> the<00:06:48.630> Tom<00:06:48.780> that<00:06:48.990> I've

00:06:49.070 --> 00:06:49.080 
with regards to the Tom that I've

00:06:49.080 --> 00:06:51.710 
with regards to the Tom that I've
explained<00:06:49.440> in<00:06:49.530> a<00:06:49.590> previous<00:06:49.920> lesson<00:06:50.390> but<00:06:51.390> like

00:06:51.710 --> 00:06:51.720 
explained in a previous lesson but like

00:06:51.720 --> 00:06:53.210 
explained in a previous lesson but like
I<00:06:51.810> said<00:06:51.990> if<00:06:52.110> you<00:06:52.200> want<00:06:52.350> to<00:06:52.440> push<00:06:52.560> yourself<00:06:52.680> and

00:06:53.210 --> 00:06:53.220 
I said if you want to push yourself and

00:06:53.220 --> 00:06:54.110 
I said if you want to push yourself and
really<00:06:53.400> make<00:06:53.610> yourself<00:06:53.910> more<00:06:54.060> comfortable

00:06:54.110 --> 00:06:54.120 
really make yourself more comfortable

00:06:54.120 --> 00:06:55.790 
really make yourself more comfortable
with<00:06:54.630> the<00:06:54.720> difficult<00:06:55.170> stuff<00:06:55.380> so<00:06:55.560> that<00:06:55.680> the

00:06:55.790 --> 00:06:55.800 
with the difficult stuff so that the

00:06:55.800 --> 00:06:58.700 
with the difficult stuff so that the
easy<00:06:55.980> stuff<00:06:56.340> becomes<00:06:56.940> easier<00:06:57.380> then<00:06:58.380> push

00:06:58.700 --> 00:06:58.710 
easy stuff becomes easier then push

00:06:58.710 --> 00:07:00.530 
easy stuff becomes easier then push
yourself<00:06:58.830> harder<00:06:59.340> go<00:06:59.580> further<00:06:59.820> and<00:07:00.090> get<00:07:00.330> more

00:07:00.530 --> 00:07:00.540 
yourself harder go further and get more

00:07:00.540 --> 00:07:01.820 
yourself harder go further and get more
uncomfortable<00:07:00.930> in<00:07:01.290> which<00:07:01.410> in<00:07:01.560> this<00:07:01.650> case

00:07:01.820 --> 00:07:01.830 
uncomfortable in which in this case

00:07:01.830 --> 00:07:03.320 
uncomfortable in which in this case
would<00:07:02.040> probably<00:07:02.130> mean<00:07:02.460> going<00:07:02.700> further<00:07:03.030> away

00:07:03.320 --> 00:07:03.330 
would probably mean going further away

00:07:03.330 --> 00:07:05.540 
would probably mean going further away
from<00:07:03.360> the<00:07:03.630> snare<00:07:03.870> so<00:07:04.140> just<00:07:05.070> to<00:07:05.160> play<00:07:05.310> you<00:07:05.370> guys

00:07:05.540 --> 00:07:05.550 
from the snare so just to play you guys

00:07:05.550 --> 00:07:09.260 
from the snare so just to play you guys
out<00:07:05.790> I'll<00:07:06.540> just<00:07:06.600> kind<00:07:06.960> of<00:07:07.050> see<00:07:07.700> if<00:07:08.700> I<00:07:08.880> can<00:07:09.060> maybe

00:07:09.260 --> 00:07:09.270 
out I'll just kind of see if I can maybe

00:07:09.270 --> 00:07:11.150 
out I'll just kind of see if I can maybe
do<00:07:09.540> the<00:07:09.660> sweep<00:07:09.900> between<00:07:10.320> the<00:07:10.650> crash<00:07:10.860> in<00:07:11.070> the

00:07:11.150 --> 00:07:11.160 
do the sweep between the crash in the

00:07:11.160 --> 00:07:13.070 
do the sweep between the crash in the
snare<00:07:11.370> and<00:07:11.430> and<00:07:11.820> still<00:07:12.270> hit<00:07:12.570> the<00:07:12.600> middle<00:07:12.930> of

00:07:13.070 --> 00:07:13.080 
snare and and still hit the middle of

00:07:13.080 --> 00:07:14.960 
snare and and still hit the middle of
the<00:07:13.170> snare<00:07:13.410> and<00:07:13.590> still<00:07:14.010> keep<00:07:14.190> it<00:07:14.310> smooth<00:07:14.610> but

00:07:14.960 --> 00:07:14.970 
the snare and still keep it smooth but
