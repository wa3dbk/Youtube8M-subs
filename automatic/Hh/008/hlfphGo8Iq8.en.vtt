such a hard time as well and the other
downside<00:01:37.590> is<00:01:37.860> sure<00:01:38.280> wand<00:01:38.760> is<00:01:39.210> quite<00:01:39.630> long<00:01:40.440> and

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.320 
big and it's a buffing wand and it's a

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:46.700 
big and it's a buffing wand and it's a
so<00:01:44.040> it's<00:01:44.190> a<00:01:44.310> very<00:01:44.340> big<00:01:44.940> kind<00:01:45.330> of<00:01:45.450> head<00:01:45.990> and<00:01:46.260> wand

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:46.710 
so it's a very big kind of head and wand

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:49.760 
so it's a very big kind of head and wand
and<00:01:47.360> getting<00:01:48.360> into<00:01:48.600> all<00:01:48.930> the<00:01:49.170> lashes<00:01:49.590> and

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770 
and getting into all the lashes and

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:51.590 
and getting into all the lashes and
stuff<00:01:50.040> can<00:01:50.280> sometimes<00:01:50.760> be<00:01:51.090> a<00:01:51.120> little<00:01:51.330> bit

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600 
stuff can sometimes be a little bit

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:54.020 
stuff can sometimes be a little bit
tricky<00:01:52.050> and<00:01:52.800> that's<00:01:53.100> probably<00:01:53.580> the<00:01:53.820> only

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
tricky and that's probably the only

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:57.860 
tricky and that's probably the only
downside<00:01:54.900> of<00:01:55.020> this<00:01:55.050> mascara<00:01:56.240> also<00:01:57.240> oh<00:01:57.540> no

downside of this mascara also oh no
there<00:01:58.380> is<00:01:58.530> another<00:01:58.560> downside<00:01:59.130> the<00:01:59.880> waterproof

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:00.690 
there is another downside the waterproof

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:04.070 
there is another downside the waterproof
version<00:02:00.990> of<00:02:01.380> this<00:02:01.560> is<00:02:01.950> like<00:02:02.580> the<00:02:03.000> biggest<00:02:03.360> pain

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:04.080 
version of this is like the biggest pain

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:06.980 
version of this is like the biggest pain
