I have had to do in this game so far and
that<00:00:15.990> is<00:00:16.350> to<00:00:16.830> build<00:00:17.250> our<00:00:17.609> motor<00:00:18.119> engine<00:00:19.400> so

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:20.400 
that is to build our motor engine so

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:23.090 
that is to build our motor engine so
without<00:00:20.820> further<00:00:20.970> ado<00:00:21.689> let's<00:00:22.289> quickly<00:00:22.680> take<00:00:23.039> a

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:25.260 
look at the motor engine to find these

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:26.929 
look at the motor engine to find these
parts<00:00:25.680> you<00:00:25.830> would<00:00:25.980> need<00:00:26.189> to<00:00:26.250> go<00:00:26.580> to<00:00:26.640> these

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
found extremely rare was the carbonator

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:41.210
