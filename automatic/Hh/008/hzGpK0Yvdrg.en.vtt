the<00:00:26.970> BMW<00:00:27.869> guggenheim<00:00:27.960> from<00:00:28.410> lab<00:00:28.560> is<00:00:28.830> really<00:00:29.160> a

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:29.189 
the BMW guggenheim from lab is really a

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:31.849 
the BMW guggenheim from lab is really a
mixture<00:00:29.550> between<00:00:29.970> an<00:00:30.840> urban<00:00:31.230> thing<00:00:31.439> to<00:00:31.619> hang<00:00:31.740> a

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:31.859 
mixture between an urban thing to hang a

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:33.799 
mixture between an urban thing to hang a
community<00:00:32.279> center<00:00:32.669> and<00:00:33.000> a<00:00:33.120> gathering<00:00:33.510> space

00:00:33.799 --> 00:00:33.809 
community center and a gathering space

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:35.990 
community center and a gathering space
so<00:00:34.500> the<00:00:34.620> idea<00:00:34.739> is<00:00:34.980> that<00:00:35.070> you<00:00:35.250> take<00:00:35.430> a<00:00:35.489> range<00:00:35.820> of

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:36.000 
so the idea is that you take a range of

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.389 
so the idea is that you take a range of
people<00:00:36.239> from<00:00:36.630> wildly<00:00:37.559> different<00:00:37.890> disciplines

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:40.100 
people from wildly different disciplines
you<00:00:38.579> throw<00:00:38.850> them<00:00:38.969> together<00:00:39.149> and<00:00:39.570> see<00:00:39.629> if<00:00:39.899> they

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:40.110 
you throw them together and see if they

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:42.799 
you throw them together and see if they
can<00:00:40.320> come<00:00:40.500> up<00:00:40.559> with<00:00:40.890> new<00:00:41.370> ideas<00:00:41.809> experiments

00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:42.809
