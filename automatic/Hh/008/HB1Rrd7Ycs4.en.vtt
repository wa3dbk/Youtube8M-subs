actually kind of surprised that zombies
are<00:00:14.519> still<00:00:14.820> that<00:00:15.030> popular<00:00:15.780> I<00:00:16.020> would<00:00:16.500> have

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:16.590 
are still that popular I would have

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:18.290 
are still that popular I would have
expected<00:00:17.010> the<00:00:17.070> undead<00:00:17.550> to<00:00:17.580> be<00:00:17.850> a<00:00:17.880> bit<00:00:18.090> more

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:18.300 
expected the undead to be a bit more

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:22.490 
expected the undead to be a bit more
short-lived<00:00:19.260> if<00:00:19.680> you<00:00:19.920> will<00:00:20.100> as<00:00:20.400> a<00:00:20.750> pop<00:00:21.750> culture

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:22.500 
short-lived if you will as a pop culture

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:25.970 
short-lived if you will as a pop culture
phenomenon<00:00:23.250> but<00:00:24.000> whatever<00:00:24.890> people<00:00:25.890> have

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:25.980 
phenomenon but whatever people have

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:29.390 
phenomenon but whatever people have
asked<00:00:26.400> me<00:00:26.609> what<00:00:27.599> I<00:00:27.900> think<00:00:28.680> would<00:00:28.830> be<00:00:28.890> a<00:00:29.039> good

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:29.400 
asked me what I think would be a good

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:33.560 
asked me what I think would be a good
zombie<00:00:30.029> killing<00:00:30.689> sword<00:00:31.140> and<00:00:32.210> now<00:00:33.210> quite

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:33.570 
zombie killing sword and now quite

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:36.110 
zombie killing sword and now quite
frankly<00:00:33.840> personally<00:00:34.800> I<00:00:34.980> wouldn't<00:00:35.610> take<00:00:35.880> a

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:36.120 
frankly personally I wouldn't take a

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:37.479 
frankly personally I wouldn't take a
sword<00:00:36.420> in<00:00:36.780> the<00:00:37.110> zombie<00:00:37.260> apocalypse

00:00:37.479 --> 00:00:37.489 
sword in the zombie apocalypse

00:00:37.489 --> 00:00:42.970 
sword in the zombie apocalypse
whatsoever<00:00:39.440> for<00:00:40.440> several<00:00:41.040> reasons<00:00:41.550> for<00:00:42.149> one

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:42.980 
whatsoever for several reasons for one

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:46.729 
whatsoever for several reasons for one
you<00:00:43.980> have<00:00:44.010> to<00:00:44.579> really<00:00:45.300> maintain<00:00:45.660> a<00:00:46.020> sword<00:00:46.500> you

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:46.739 
you have to really maintain a sword you

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:49.700 
you have to really maintain a sword you
have<00:00:46.860> to<00:00:46.980> keep<00:00:47.309> it<00:00:47.520> sharp<00:00:48.350> otherwise<00:00:49.350> it's

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
have to keep it sharp otherwise it's

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:54.290 
have to keep it sharp otherwise it's
just<00:00:49.860> not<00:00:50.100> very<00:00:50.850> effective<00:00:52.370> whereas<00:00:53.370> if<00:00:54.120> you

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
just not very effective whereas if you

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:58.750 
just not very effective whereas if you
take<00:00:54.510> something<00:00:54.870> like<00:00:55.610> an<00:00:56.610> axe<00:00:56.789> or<00:00:57.260> tomahawk

00:00:58.750 --> 00:00:58.760 
take something like an axe or tomahawk

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:03.560 
take something like an axe or tomahawk
even<00:00:59.760> if<00:01:00.000> the<00:01:00.239> thing<00:01:00.600> is<00:01:01.160> completely<00:01:02.239> dull<00:01:03.270> I

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
even if the thing is completely dull I

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:06.649 
even if the thing is completely dull I
guess<00:01:04.409> completely<00:01:04.860> lost<00:01:05.070> its<00:01:05.280> edge<00:01:05.460> the<00:01:06.360> edges

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659 
guess completely lost its edge the edges

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:09.859 
guess completely lost its edge the edges
damage<00:01:07.020> whatever<00:01:07.500> it<00:01:08.280> kids<00:01:09.060> to<00:01:09.240> crack<00:01:09.479> a<00:01:09.510> skull

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:09.869 
damage whatever it kids to crack a skull

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:13.160 
damage whatever it kids to crack a skull
it<00:01:10.110> is<00:01:11.010> still<00:01:11.280> pretty<00:01:11.490> effective<00:01:12.170> especially

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
it is still pretty effective especially

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:17.210 
it is still pretty effective especially
if<00:01:14.040> it<00:01:14.610> has<00:01:14.760> a<00:01:14.790> back<00:01:15.090> spike<00:01:15.450> like<00:01:15.780> this<00:01:16.020> I<00:01:16.229> mean

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
if it has a back spike like this I mean

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:21.280 
if it has a back spike like this I mean
the<00:01:17.700> spike<00:01:18.090> is<00:01:18.360> actually<00:01:18.990> fairly<00:01:19.700> blunt

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:21.290 
the spike is actually fairly blunt

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:24.530 
the spike is actually fairly blunt
comparatively<00:01:22.290> but<00:01:23.040> if<00:01:23.369> you<00:01:23.490> drive<00:01:23.820> that<00:01:24.090> into

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
comparatively but if you drive that into

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:28.310 
comparatively but if you drive that into
a<00:01:24.689> skull<00:01:24.930> yeah<00:01:25.770> it's<00:01:26.580> got<00:01:26.850> a<00:01:26.880> stick<00:01:27.180> it's<00:01:28.049> going

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
a skull yeah it's got a stick it's going

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:32.270 
a skull yeah it's got a stick it's going
to<00:01:28.380> do<00:01:28.500> some<00:01:28.740> significant<00:01:29.460> damage<00:01:31.220> they<00:01:32.220> are

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
to do some significant damage they are

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:35.539 
to do some significant damage they are
just<00:01:32.549> more<00:01:33.210> damage<00:01:33.780> resistant<00:01:34.560> in<00:01:34.799> general<00:01:35.490> I

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:35.549 
just more damage resistant in general I

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:39.469 
just more damage resistant in general I
mean<00:01:35.579> yeah<00:01:36.000> sure<00:01:36.360> the<00:01:37.729> the<00:01:38.729> shaft<00:01:39.000> can<00:01:39.210> break

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479 
mean yeah sure the the shaft can break

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:43.880 
mean yeah sure the the shaft can break
um<00:01:41.659> regardless<00:01:42.659> of<00:01:42.869> whether<00:01:43.049> it's<00:01:43.290> wood<00:01:43.619> or

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
um regardless of whether it's wood or

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:47.120 
um regardless of whether it's wood or
plastic<00:01:44.189> or<00:01:44.850> whatever<00:01:45.329> it<00:01:46.320> can<00:01:46.560> always<00:01:46.799> break

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
plastic or whatever it can always break

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:49.100 
plastic or whatever it can always break
and<00:01:47.369> then<00:01:47.460> you<00:01:47.520> kind<00:01:47.729> of<00:01:47.790> screwed<00:01:47.970> but<00:01:48.840> of

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110

that<00:04:53.040> would<00:04:53.250> be<00:04:53.330> you<00:04:54.330> know<00:04:54.360> keeping<00:04:54.870> those

00:04:55.490 --> 00:04:55.500 
that would be you know keeping those

00:04:55.500 --> 00:04:57.920 
that would be you know keeping those
thinkers<00:04:55.980> at<00:04:56.160> distance<00:04:56.580> if<00:04:57.000> you're<00:04:57.300> elsewhere

00:04:57.920 --> 00:04:57.930 
thinkers at distance if you're elsewhere

00:04:57.930 --> 00:05:00.650 
thinkers at distance if you're elsewhere
they<00:04:58.710> can't<00:04:59.040> eat<00:04:59.250> your<00:04:59.460> tasty<00:04:59.940> juicy<00:05:00.360> brains

00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:00.660 
they can't eat your tasty juicy brains

00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:03.410 
they can't eat your tasty juicy brains
if<00:05:00.990> you<00:05:01.140> just<00:05:01.290> keep<00:05:01.680> them<00:05:01.890> at<00:05:02.130> distance<00:05:02.640> but

00:05:03.410 --> 00:05:03.420 
if you just keep them at distance but

00:05:03.420 --> 00:05:06.590 
if you just keep them at distance but
you<00:05:03.450> should<00:05:03.900> definitely<00:05:04.850> have<00:05:05.850> a<00:05:06.240> backup

00:05:06.590 --> 00:05:06.600 
you should definitely have a backup

00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:08.570 
you should definitely have a backup
which<00:05:07.230> is<00:05:07.380> where<00:05:07.560> this<00:05:07.680> comes<00:05:07.920> in<00:05:08.190> you<00:05:08.550> know

00:05:08.570 --> 00:05:08.580 
which is where this comes in you know

00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:10.220 
which is where this comes in you know
that<00:05:08.850> combination<00:05:09.420> can<00:05:09.540> do<00:05:09.660> a<00:05:09.690> variety<00:05:09.870> of

00:05:10.220 --> 00:05:10.230 
that combination can do a variety of

00:05:10.230 --> 00:05:12.910 
that combination can do a variety of
things<00:05:10.560> both<00:05:10.920> combat<00:05:11.550> and<00:05:11.850> tool<00:05:12.090> related<00:05:12.660> and

00:05:12.910 --> 00:05:12.920 
things both combat and tool related and

00:05:12.920 --> 00:05:17.270 
things both combat and tool related and
the<00:05:13.920> it's<00:05:14.340> so<00:05:14.670> fairly<00:05:15.360> safe<00:05:15.690> bet<00:05:16.190> also<00:05:17.190> it

00:05:17.270 --> 00:05:17.280 
the it's so fairly safe bet also it

00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:20.120 
the it's so fairly safe bet also it
doesn't<00:05:17.460> require<00:05:17.910> that<00:05:18.540> much<00:05:19.500> skill<00:05:19.950> or

00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:20.130 
doesn't require that much skill or

00:05:20.130 --> 00:05:22.220 
doesn't require that much skill or
training<00:05:20.670> with<00:05:21.270> a<00:05:21.300> sword<00:05:21.750> you<00:05:21.990> have<00:05:22.110> to

00:05:22.220 --> 00:05:22.230 
training with a sword you have to

00:05:22.230 --> 00:05:25.460 
training with a sword you have to
practice<00:05:22.830> quite<00:05:23.190> a<00:05:23.250> bit<00:05:23.640> to<00:05:24.360> you<00:05:24.930> know<00:05:25.050> get<00:05:25.320> the

00:05:25.460 --> 00:05:25.470 
practice quite a bit to you know get the

00:05:25.470 --> 00:05:27.770 
practice quite a bit to you know get the
edge<00:05:25.650> alignment<00:05:26.310> right<00:05:26.490> and<00:05:26.790> the<00:05:26.850> cut<00:05:27.120> because

00:05:27.770 --> 00:05:27.780 
edge alignment right and the cut because

00:05:27.780 --> 00:05:29.930 
edge alignment right and the cut because
if<00:05:28.020> your<00:05:28.170> edge<00:05:28.350> alignment<00:05:28.920> is<00:05:29.010> off<00:05:29.220> even<00:05:29.820> the

00:05:29.930 --> 00:05:29.940 
if your edge alignment is off even the

00:05:29.940 --> 00:05:31.850 
if your edge alignment is off even the
sharpest<00:05:30.510> sword<00:05:30.720> in<00:05:30.960> the<00:05:31.050> world<00:05:31.080> will<00:05:31.620> just

00:05:31.850 --> 00:05:31.860 
sharpest sword in the world will just

00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:34.070 
sharpest sword in the world will just
bounce<00:05:32.190> off<00:05:32.520> and<00:05:32.790> do<00:05:32.910> fairly<00:05:33.330> little<00:05:33.660> damage

00:05:34.070 --> 00:05:34.080 
bounce off and do fairly little damage

00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:36.290 
bounce off and do fairly little damage
if<00:05:34.290> you<00:05:34.950> just<00:05:35.130> hit<00:05:35.400> you<00:05:35.670> know<00:05:35.760> most<00:05:35.970> people<00:05:36.240> to

00:05:36.290 --> 00:05:36.300 
if you just hit you know most people to

00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:39.200 
if you just hit you know most people to
flat<00:05:36.650> whereas<00:05:37.650> something<00:05:38.280> like<00:05:38.400> this<00:05:38.670> you

00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:39.210 
flat whereas something like this you

00:05:39.210 --> 00:05:41.690 
flat whereas something like this you
just<00:05:39.510> whack<00:05:40.320> away<00:05:40.560> basically<00:05:41.400> it<00:05:41.520> doesn't

00:05:41.690 --> 00:05:41.700 
just whack away basically it doesn't

00:05:41.700 --> 00:05:45.380 
just whack away basically it doesn't
take<00:05:42.000> that<00:05:42.030> much<00:05:43.280> spear<00:05:44.280> is<00:05:44.400> even<00:05:44.700> simpler<00:05:45.000> the

00:05:45.380 --> 00:05:45.390 
take that much spear is even simpler the

00:05:45.390 --> 00:05:47.210 
take that much spear is even simpler the
spear<00:05:45.840> is<00:05:45.960> pretty<00:05:46.200> much<00:05:46.260> the<00:05:46.470> easiest<00:05:46.500> to

00:05:47.210 --> 00:05:47.220 
spear is pretty much the easiest to

00:05:47.220 --> 00:05:50.300 
spear is pretty much the easiest to
learn<00:05:47.400> weapon<00:05:48.210> in<00:05:48.300> the<00:05:48.390> world<00:05:48.890> you<00:05:49.890> just<00:05:50.100> keep

00:05:50.300 --> 00:05:50.310 
learn weapon in the world you just keep

00:05:50.310 --> 00:05:52.700 
learn weapon in the world you just keep
the<00:05:50.400> point<00:05:50.610> in<00:05:50.700> front<00:05:50.820> of<00:05:50.940> you<00:05:51.060> and<00:05:51.270> you<00:05:51.720> stick

00:05:52.700 --> 00:05:52.710 
the point in front of you and you stick

00:05:52.710 --> 00:05:54.860 
the point in front of you and you stick
them<00:05:52.770> with<00:05:52.860> a<00:05:52.950> pond<00:05:53.100> yet<00:05:53.300> that's<00:05:54.300> all<00:05:54.600> there<00:05:54.750> is

00:05:54.860 --> 00:05:54.870 
them with a pond yet that's all there is

00:05:54.870 --> 00:05:58.520 
them with a pond yet that's all there is
to<00:05:54.990> it<00:05:55.110> you<00:05:55.140> just<00:05:55.380> keep<00:05:55.860> thrusting<00:05:57.530> sexual

00:05:58.520 --> 00:05:58.530 
to it you just keep thrusting sexual

00:05:58.530 --> 00:06:01.220 
to it you just keep thrusting sexual
innuendo<00:05:59.040> all<00:05:59.220> the<00:05:59.340> way<00:05:59.430> but<00:06:00.330> yeah<00:06:00.750> that's

00:06:01.220 --> 00:06:01.230 
innuendo all the way but yeah that's

00:06:01.230 --> 00:06:02.960 
innuendo all the way but yeah that's
pretty<00:06:01.650> much<00:06:01.770> what<00:06:01.860> I<00:06:02.040> would<00:06:02.250> do<00:06:02.370> go<00:06:02.760> with

00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:02.970 
pretty much what I would do go with

00:06:02.970 --> 00:06:07.310 
pretty much what I would do go with
sword<00:06:03.810> not<00:06:04.410> so<00:06:04.620> much<00:06:04.800> so<00:06:05.190> yeah<00:06:05.340> that's<00:06:05.940> my<00:06:06.320> two
