 Hi every one! This is Battle Worlds: Kronos 

00:00:04.847 --> 00:00:07.247
 A classic, turn-based strategy game. 

00:00:07.817 --> 00:00:16.440
 We at King Art Games played games like Battle Isle, Advance Wars, Panzer General and other SSI classics in the night, and loved every minute. 

00:00:17.426 --> 00:00:22.285
 These games involve clever tactics, long-term planning, transparent rules and difficult decisions 

00:00:22.311 --> 00:00:26.520
 And so it should be. It is a truly unique gaming experience. 

00:00:27.319 --> 00:00:33.512
 With Battle Worlds: Kronos, we want to help revive the genre and let a new generation of gamers experience it. 

00:00:36.391 --> 00:00:40.472
 A few years ago we developed a prototype. Test players among fans of turn-based games loved it 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:48.426
 But then it was impossible to obtain external funding for a classic, turn-based game, and as indie developers we could not bear the cost alone. 

00:00:48.613 --> 00:00:50.643
 We had to postpone our dream. 

00:00:52.037 --> 00:00:56.021
 We moved on and developed a game in another, apparently unpopular, genre: 

00:00:56.301 --> 00:00:59.052
 The Point &amp; Click adventure: "The Book of Unwritten Tales". 

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:05.320
 And it turned out that although someone says there is no interest in a particular game genre, it doesn't mean there's really no interest. 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:17.707
 We believe that good games will always win that players want varied experiences and that time is ripe for a new, good turn-based strategy game. 

00:01:18.083 --> 00:01:19.476
 This is our plan: 

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:26.386
 We take everything from the prototype that was good and bring the game's ideas up-to-date with modern graphics and new technology 

00:01:27.058 --> 00:01:35.431
 Battle Worlds: Kronos will feature two rows of single-player missions, controlling high-tech armies and low-tech guerrilla forces in an epic battle of the planet Kronos. 

00:01:35.432 --> 00:01:42.270
 In these story-driven mission ranks, you will compete against a sophisticated hostile AI through increasingly challenging missions. 

00:01:42.511 --> 00:01:44.480
 In addition, the game has: 

00:01:44.798 --> 00:01:48.640
 Single-player Challenge Maps that tests your abilities in various scenarios 

00:01:49.002 --> 00:01:51.400
 multiplayer via internet or Hot Seat 

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:54.800
 and an asynchronous multiplayer function. 

00:01:55.547 --> 00:02:03.630
 This last gameplay allows you to perform your moves at your own pace. The game is then stored on our server and your opponent performs his moves in the same way. 

00:02:03.909 --> 00:02:11.700
 This allows you to continue the fight whenever and wherever you want, on a PC, Mac, Linux or even in your browser. 

00:02:11.771 --> 00:02:15.190
 As support for the project, you get all these versions for free. 

00:02:18.395 --> 00:02:21.470
 Supporters also get instant access to our development forum 

00:02:21.833 --> 00:02:23.510
 an easy-to-use mission designer 

00:02:23.799 --> 00:02:30.480
 and depending on your support level, access to alpha and beta versions, as well as the opportunity to participate in multi-player test events. 

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:33.590
 Excited already? We are. 

00:02:34.116 --> 00:02:40.060
 So, if you love turn-based strategy games as much as we do, continue our Kickstarter campaign 

00:02:40.187 --> 00:02:44.440
 Support the project, become part of the community and tell your friends about the project. 

00:02:45.154 --> 00:02:47.560
 Thanks!
