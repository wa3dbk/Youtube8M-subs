00:00:03.290 --> 00:00:07.100
 there is that whole nation of design 

00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:09.680
 and we are in a new video and in this 

00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:11.209
 occasion we are in a video 

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:12.650
 tutorial this is the first video 

00:00:11.209 --> 00:00:13.580
 tutorial you do but so I hope 

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:14.840
 that I get it right and any 

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:16.340
 recommendation then in the comments 

00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:18.020
 here is fine or any suggestion of 

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:20.570
 some tutorial I do and if I can 

00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:22.960
 do so for the first ones that comes 

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:25.029
 what it says in the title is worth 

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:26.560
 how to record huesca while things without 

00:00:25.029 --> 00:00:28.900
 console well it's simple just 

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:31.390
 we need two programs worth the 

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:34.239
 first a capture program whether 

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:36.940
 you have a catch of seeing media or if 

00:00:34.239 --> 00:00:40.300
 you have one of the cat or one of another brand 

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:43.530
 because what you always do you go here 

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:46.059
 to assistant in this case to see half 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:47.589
 that I am using laver media life 

00:00:46.059 --> 00:00:49.720
 they want universal port and quite well 

00:00:47.589 --> 00:00:51.489
 come here we have things in some things 

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:53.130
 capture device blah blah blah blah 

00:00:51.489 --> 00:00:54.870
 blah 

00:00:53.130 --> 00:00:56.730
 I recommend you to put it to it 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:59.810
 quality that they will record the web worth 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:02.640
 so that it looks good so that it looks 

00:00:59.810 --> 00:01:04.890
 as leveled necessary completely 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:07.860
 but but good is a recommendation of mine 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:11.000
 very young here because I have in this case 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:11.000
 the console turned on 

00:01:11.730 --> 00:01:17.240
 we get in ready let's go can 

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:19.710
 cancel and here we have our program 

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:22.020
 simple because here is how we recorded from 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:24.240
 all life very well then since 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:26.700
 we have ready this program look and the 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:28.500
 webcam well we do not have to maintain 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:29.940
 I'm going to close this program because it's 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:32.160
 a little uncomfortable to see my face during 

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:33.540
 all the tutorial well we are this 

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:35.460
 program called split blow 

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:38.520
 broadcast the one that I'll leave you down here 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:39.870
 the link in in the description and in fact 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:43.110
 what we have to do is to see I'm going to 

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:46.000
 close this is all over so we are going 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:50.820
 to get in here let's go let's put 

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:50.820
 the former law 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:56.850
 explain nothing we have to look for this 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:59.969
 explains and we will get a page so 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:01.020
 nothing we have to wait a bit and the 

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:03.390
 true baby split 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:06.479
 here is a triple w point split 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:08.640
 puntocom we are going here we close this 

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:10.019
 with comfort and we will leave this 

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:13.950
 page the only thing we have to do is 

00:02:10.019 --> 00:02:16.150
 go to download and here is good them 

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:18.340
 the 

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:19.720
 Well you can buy it but it's not 

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:21.069
 necessary if you do not have money 

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:23.590
 worry you can download this 

00:02:21.069 --> 00:02:26.260
 version and then the only thing that they have to 

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:28.569
 do is this ok let's start from 

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:33.939
 zero ok well first let's save 

00:02:28.569 --> 00:02:35.859
 this is going to look like that was very good now 

00:02:33.939 --> 00:02:37.930
 this is in black the first thing that 

00:02:35.859 --> 00:02:41.230
 we have to do is go to file and 

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:43.090
 put us on camera or add camera here 

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:44.650
 I have several capture devices 

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:47.470
 and that's why it ended and it detects 

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:49.120
 capturing that detects good here a 

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:51.340
 extra program that I have to delete it 

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:54.459
 the catcher a few things that do not 

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:55.930
 I need and here the streamer well 

00:02:54.459 --> 00:02:58.750
 let's put here in microsoft lifecam 

00:02:55.930 --> 00:03:01.720
 hd 3000 which is what I have that records 

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:03.069
 720 p and this one is quite functional not 

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:04.840
 it's not that it's the best but it's 

00:03:03.069 --> 00:03:07.180
 work what we are at the size that 

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:09.519
 we really do not influence much 

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:12.099
 I adjusted it completely but we will 

00:03:09.519 --> 00:03:13.389
 continue fine we already have the file and 

00:03:12.099 --> 00:03:16.299
 now we care 

00:03:13.389 --> 00:03:17.260
 this is worth I have it in the maximum 

00:03:16.299 --> 00:03:19.890
 quality 

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:22.440
 its maximum quality as you put it 

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:24.050
 and here it is good I always recommend 

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:26.340
 put the highest quality to make it look 

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:29.580
 exists 

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:31.319
 frame rate 30 fps is like normally 

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:34.470
 the games capture at 30 fps is what 

00:03:31.319 --> 00:03:36.290
 normal is to have it at 30 or 29 points 97 already 

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:39.260
 It will be your decision 

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:40.790
 well here transition this is one thing 

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:43.939
 we do not need because no 

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:48.109
 let's finish well projector everything is 

00:03:43.939 --> 00:03:50.000
 is that view schiavi port good here 

00:03:48.109 --> 00:03:52.640
 we can put for example to see the 

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:55.939
 10 percent in this case we can put 

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:58.099
 to see adgate was not everything here 

00:03:55.939 --> 00:03:59.390
 let's make the synod look 

00:03:58.099 --> 00:04:01.520
 hundred like youtube I want this 

00:03:59.390 --> 00:04:03.410
 most common and what I recommend most 

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:05.450
 well we already have this that of another that 

00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:06.990
 we have to do well I can get 

00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:09.450
 this 

00:04:06.990 --> 00:04:11.430
 if they are going to capture him from here and his 

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:14.550
 capturing does not have delayed eye 

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:15.900
 have no audio delay because that 

00:04:14.550 --> 00:04:18.959
 yes it is very important if you are not going to see 

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:21.300
 all very delayed what they have to 

00:04:18.959 --> 00:04:23.040
 to do is mutate this put this so that 

00:04:21.300 --> 00:04:24.300
 I did not hear any system sound and 

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:26.880
 mount this so you do not hear your 

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:30.240
 double voice that good to fix in 

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:32.040
 edition but it is for good question is 

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:35.010
 for producing programs that I recommend 

00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:36.780
 to edit vegas pro and right now do not 

00:04:35.010 --> 00:04:39.810
 I have here - in fact I've seen it 

00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:44.640
 tomorrow that is ice cream premier cc to two 

00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:46.920
 premieres if the c ceases to separate 

00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:49.510
 as this 

00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:51.520
 another note is worth 

00:04:49.510 --> 00:04:54.160
 they say they have a powerful weight because 

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:56.560
 because as you know when you capture the 

00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:58.150
 video because it takes a lot of the 

00:04:56.560 --> 00:05:00.400
 goat resources to take command 

00:04:58.150 --> 00:05:02.720
 so that they see that everything is going well and that 

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:06.920
 the image is stopped 

00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:09.140
 ok let's use a powerful pc because 

00:05:06.920 --> 00:05:13.760
 because if already in itself to record a 

00:05:09.140 --> 00:05:16.550
 video so you need power because now 

00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:18.510
 imagine nothing I'm showing you that 

00:05:16.550 --> 00:05:21.080
 everything goes well 

00:05:18.510 --> 00:05:21.080
 all right 

00:05:21.150 --> 00:05:26.750
 imagine if you need power 

00:05:25.009 --> 00:05:29.390
 for 

00:05:26.750 --> 00:05:32.690
 to record this to record a gameplay 

00:05:29.390 --> 00:05:35.300
 normal now imagine the power 

00:05:32.690 --> 00:05:37.790
 you need to record a gameplay and 

00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:40.270
 a webcam this is the note I want 

00:05:37.790 --> 00:05:42.740
 give if they do not have a very powerful weight 

00:05:40.270 --> 00:05:45.080
 down in the resolution of the camera is worth 

00:05:42.740 --> 00:05:48.980
 I say it because if you do not have a company 

00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:52.460
 very powerful because they are going for the 

00:05:48.980 --> 00:05:54.830
 recording everything go wrong I do not just recommend 

00:05:52.460 --> 00:05:57.470
 the highest quality if they have a 

00:05:54.830 --> 00:06:00.200
 good pc and if not then they are adjusting 

00:05:57.470 --> 00:06:01.669
 they go up going down depending on how 

00:06:00.200 --> 00:06:05.000
 I recommend you first make some 

00:06:01.669 --> 00:06:06.919
 how many recordings of test and there are see 

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:08.270
 everything goes well so nothing 

00:06:06.919 --> 00:06:10.040
 this has been the tutorial I'm going to download 

00:06:08.270 --> 00:06:12.080
 this screen and I hope that I have 

00:06:10.040 --> 00:06:14.390
 liked very much guys that's the 

00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:17.450
 first tutorial that I do not dedicate myself 

00:06:14.390 --> 00:06:19.550
 a lot of them but if they want some 

00:06:17.450 --> 00:06:22.610
 tutorial of something that I see that will be 

00:06:19.550 --> 00:06:23.990
 optimal that may interest people 

00:06:22.610 --> 00:06:25.880
 Well, I'll leave it down here in the 

00:06:23.990 --> 00:06:28.009
 comments just leave here 

00:06:25.880 --> 00:06:33.710
 caracas with comments and sera 

00:06:28.009 --> 00:06:35.180
 thank you comment and share the video 

00:06:33.710 --> 00:06:36.289
 so your friends also know they are not 

00:06:35.180 --> 00:06:38.119
 those with functions you see for this 

00:06:36.289 --> 00:06:40.990
 tab and nothing we're going to be 

00:06:38.119 --> 00:06:40.990
 next to god
