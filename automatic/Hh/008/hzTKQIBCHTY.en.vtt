00:04:54.659 --> 00:04:54.669 
to get used to it I guess but I said I

00:04:54.669 --> 00:04:57.770 
to get used to it I guess but I said I
just<00:04:55.060> don't<00:04:55.360> think<00:04:56.139> it's<00:04:56.350> the<00:04:56.560> whole<00:04:56.889> 10<00:04:57.370> I

00:04:57.770 --> 00:04:57.780 
just don't think it's the whole 10 I

00:04:57.780 --> 00:05:02.370 
just don't think it's the whole 10 I
honestly<00:04:59.880> think<00:05:00.880> is<00:05:01.090> maybe<00:05:01.330> around<00:05:01.570> six<00:05:02.050> or

00:05:02.370 --> 00:05:02.380 
honestly think is maybe around six or

00:05:02.380 --> 00:05:07.980 
honestly think is maybe around six or
seven<00:05:03.270> that's<00:05:04.270> just<00:05:04.389> my<00:05:04.599> opinion<00:05:04.979> so<00:05:06.990> if

00:05:07.980 --> 00:05:07.990 
seven that's just my opinion so if
