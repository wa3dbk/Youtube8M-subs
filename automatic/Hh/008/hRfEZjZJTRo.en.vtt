00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:47.199
 well and today we find ourselves so 

00:00:45.579 --> 00:00:49.510
 for a new commented gameplay so 

00:00:47.199 --> 00:00:51.579
 in compensation Iup confirmed at the 

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:53.920
 let go again the habit of moderating 

00:00:51.579 --> 00:00:55.960
 warfare 3 so today we get 

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:58.860
 so find on call of duty black ops 

00:00:55.960 --> 00:01:02.620
 of course on the career map 

00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:04.180
 so the famous aircraft carrier so I'm going 

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:07.479
 introduce yourself quickly to the gameplay 

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:09.899
 so listen I was with the 8.1 this 

00:01:07.479 --> 00:01:12.220
 weapon the mutineers it's just the best 

00:01:09.899 --> 00:01:14.770
 I never played for 

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:19.090
 moment i after i have not played yet 

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:20.860
 like the pgw 57 or msm it's up to you 

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:22.570
 in Toulon told me it was sensas 

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:25.210
 both of them so I can not wait to 

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:26.740
 see and so I will describe you my 

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:28.000
 mutineers so I was with the 

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:30.100
 shot coach 

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.899
 because otherwise she is in love and in 

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:35.320
 burst and really galley me I 

00:01:31.899 --> 00:01:37.690
 can not really manage I had 

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:41.319
 also the laser sight so not the viewfinder 

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:42.360
 reflex the laser pointer am from bf3 there 

00:01:41.319 --> 00:01:46.420
 next to the tree 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:49.239
 Then I also had the tac 45 am 

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:50.709
 seems and it was only I know more about 

00:01:49.239 --> 00:01:55.479
 anyway I had a pistol in 

00:01:50.709 --> 00:01:57.970
 secondary school and I also played with the 

00:01:55.479 --> 00:02:00.090
 trumps who was so expect who would me 

00:01:57.970 --> 00:02:04.860
 well remember it was determination 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:08.410
 looters and extreme conditions or 

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:11.170
 dexterity I know more and also low but 

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:13.480
 built that a strict ticket are all 

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:16.030
 simply the missile aster blood stone 

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:18.849
 who is the reaper and the gunner 

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:19.390
 helico adav then on this gameplay I 

00:02:18.849 --> 00:02:21.790
 will do 

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:23.470
 real massacre so that I do not 

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:25.930
 spoilerai not true I do not bump it 

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:27.760
 should not score 

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:28.959
 so I think I can tell you 

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:30.310
 it's a very, very big 

00:02:28.959 --> 00:02:34.360
 series that is not about to stop 

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:36.550
 who is not ready to stop and has 

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:39.610
 listened with the gameplay is relatively 

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:42.520
 short we are you two minutes five there 

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:45.280
 so late 2010 the on one on the 

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:46.720
 video viewer listen what's this 

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:49.400
 that I could still what do I 

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:51.590
 warnings you're talking about 

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:55.280
 so I'll tell you about the mode 

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:56.959
 studio studio mode two blackhawks 2 

00:02:55.280 --> 00:03:01.310
 there are people who say that they 

00:02:56.959 --> 00:03:03.349
 marry people say yeah it bug g 

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:05.000
 because of migration doubt I 

00:03:03.349 --> 00:03:08.659
 georges the kind of massacres but I 

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:10.579
 I did not put my game in full 

00:03:08.659 --> 00:03:12.049
 kind that the second part is that 

00:03:10.579 --> 00:03:15.049
 that 's what happened to me it's really 

00:03:12.049 --> 00:03:18.769
 infuriating is not then what does that 

00:03:15.049 --> 00:03:20.930
 still there are people who have conquered 

00:03:18.769 --> 00:03:22.700
 with the institute register outright 

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:23.900
 a shot on two so it's a 

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:27.620
 frankly will have to explain to me their 

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:29.959
 triple to whom their trip to treyarch for 

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:31.519
 down for their stuff for having 

00:03:29.959 --> 00:03:34.010
 makes another studio a bit crappy 

00:03:31.519 --> 00:03:36.010
 but frankly for me the 

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:40.760
 studio mode works really well 

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:42.409
 this gameplay is from the studio mode I 

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:43.909
 really not one there that I have 

00:03:42.409 --> 00:03:47.060
 really lost and I never lost a 

00:03:43.909 --> 00:03:49.400
 only gameplay it's sir me during 

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:50.480
 especially morning it is not bad but there is 

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:52.459
 moments where george and not need 

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:54.829
 to record live with - el gato 

00:03:52.459 --> 00:03:56.060
 because me you know that I am 

00:03:54.829 --> 00:03:58.190
 happy for you but barn movie 

00:03:56.060 --> 00:03:58.780
 I have the gift of turning in parts 

00:03:58.190 --> 00:04:02.090
 bits 

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:02.780
 short so the studio mode for me he 

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:04.519
 works very well 

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:07.549
 I have all my gameplay so like you 

00:04:04.519 --> 00:04:08.569
 can see there no bug any orc 

00:04:07.549 --> 00:04:12.260
 the station and ouchy no migration 

00:04:08.569 --> 00:04:14.090
 breakfast months all districts 

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:16.880
 hilmar so you see there there are the 

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:18.949
 stuff like elimination with adam and 

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:20.419
 all that good the only problem is that 

00:04:18.949 --> 00:04:23.090
 on this studio mode they made us a 

00:04:20.419 --> 00:04:24.690
 little also to the black earth is that in 

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:28.020
 do we do not have the 

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:30.600
 the stuff here we do not have the team lineup 

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:32.520
 so it is not are those who say that 

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:33.710
 it's a doubt that say it's 

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:36.570
 for av 

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:37.530
 but for my part, I do not care 

00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:39.360
 bit of calm cud 

00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:41.640
 at worst if we really need to do 

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:43.260
 yamba clips I do not know we take on 

00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:45.150
 takes his father on the cake care 

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:47.160
 their media or are men and we're going 

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:52.320
 do tricks chatou pretty 

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:55.050
 sorry for the pretty sequences from there 

00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:57.780
 2 2 of kull cases but also why not 

00:04:55.050 --> 00:05:00.750
 nice thing so you also see that 

00:04:57.780 --> 00:05:05.160
 currently down I'm at 43.0 finally 

00:05:00.750 --> 00:05:07.140
 sometimes 43 0 42 0 and bah listen to the 

00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:10.130
 gameplay will bring to an end the friends 

00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:14.040
 so on this I tell you next 

00:05:10.130 --> 00:05:16.200

00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:18.300
