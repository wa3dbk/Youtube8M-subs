00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:08.400
 hi this man i will introduce you 

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:15.839
 this fender words words in black 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:18.410
 fifties strata so this model one has a 

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:22.410
 really classic stratocaster shape 

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:24.779
 with an alder body accented by 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:28.920
 full of small shocks and scratches on 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:32.790
 the top and also on the underside for 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:35.730
 accentuate this vintage side at the level of 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:39.920
 sleeve we have a maple neck a 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:44.160
 room always users on the sidelines 

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:48.620
 we have jumbo frets a finer hair 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:52.620
 that the normal behind one has a profile 

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:56.780
 I have always used 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:56.780
 always to accentuate this vintage side 

00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:01.920
 at the level of the head 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:05.519
 maybe classic strata one and 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:09.619
 no problem and we have mechanics 

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:13.820
 intelligence we will detail the pickups 

00:01:09.619 --> 00:01:17.159
 we have three single coil pickups 

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:18.560
 who are tex mex here we will listen 

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:21.420
 all to their lessons 

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:24.409
 we have three buttons so as usual 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:29.549
 a button of volume of buttons of tons 

00:01:24.409 --> 00:01:31.409
 to his readers five positions always 

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:34.740
 classic strata one does not have any 

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:41.369
 worry the jack on the side 1 2 more 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:44.369
 classic a horse fx chrome and so 

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:46.670
 two at fender here for this act to 

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:46.670
 this draw 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:55.540
 let's go we start so 

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:57.100
 detail this bridge pickup so micro 

00:01:55.540 --> 00:01:59.080
 sharp I just remember that I'm in 

00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:08.800
 position volume 10 the 2 tons to ten 

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:11.500
 devices and on the amp in its clear one 

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:13.390
 continue with the intermediate position 

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:16.060
 so I just remember that we cumulate 

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:26.920
 these two microphones to know so the microphone 

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:36.970
 bridge and the central microphone of the 

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:39.790
 middle it's gone next position 

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:49.660
 then the same one combines these two microphones 

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:53.700
 so microcentrales and neck pickup and 

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:53.700
 last position neck pickup 

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:01.540
 so I'll detail you two more 

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:02.140
 three small positions with a sound a 

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:04.060
 little more punchy 

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:07.060
 so we start with the horse sound is 

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:09.989
 so a little more so more acute sound 

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:09.989
 and
