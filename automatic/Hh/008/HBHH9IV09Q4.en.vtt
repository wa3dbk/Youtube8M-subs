13 degree incline that would be around
45<00:03:18.420> degree<00:03:18.689> angle<00:03:19.079> that<00:03:19.200> we're<00:03:19.319> going<00:03:19.469> up

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:19.560 
45 degree angle that we're going up

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:21.619 
45 degree angle that we're going up
right<00:03:19.590> now<00:03:19.859> I'm<00:03:20.519> not<00:03:20.579> gonna<00:03:20.790> get<00:03:20.939> anything<00:03:21.150> I
