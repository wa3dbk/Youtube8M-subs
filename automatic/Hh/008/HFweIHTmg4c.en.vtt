00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:10.980
 Ajax won two cohen titles last Sunday and this is the moment 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:13.980
 of the match 

00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:22.210
 smart 

00:00:23.429 --> 00:00:27.559
 mikey van art you know the low point of his early career according to frank de 

00:00:27.559 --> 00:00:30.559
 farmer cannot do anything to the young goalkeeper and judge 

00:00:31.319 --> 00:00:33.500
 is it bad luck 

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:36.500
 no, I find the offer for annoyance 

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:40.810
 lucy punch in come your way yes 

00:00:40.810 --> 00:00:42.540
 this is no time to 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:44.610
 to take the ball and join 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:46.330
 shoot away 

00:00:46.330 --> 00:00:47.830
 it is and sometimes 

00:00:47.830 --> 00:00:52.300
 can he close just a little higher than once and nothing during those years 

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:55.610
 never again with the high team not at all moving 

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:59.290
 yes those are the craziest moments but the company can experience if you as a goalkeeper 

00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:03.330
 I do, however, with family of its customers 

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:07.980
 if that man are lying down then certainly an arrangement of shark fins is neighbors 

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:12.070
 and there you can't find any title from 2010 

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:17.190
 were actually nothing at all 

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:20.810
 well that powerlessness and 

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:23.820
 the second show as an athlete demonstration 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:25.290
 spoken a lot 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:28.280
 we also spoke shorter 

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:30.310
 nothing happens 

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:33.310
 for that it is supported 

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:37.120
 how much tianjin long the irna team 

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:41.990
 after the idea in which areas that is just nice 

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:45.240
 the ten a bit getting used to it 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:49.100
 fighting is not in the way but now in a positive way 

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:53.910
 also against expansion but also a new one to continue these lines 

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:57.220
 met with 

00:01:57.220 --> 00:02:00.840
 to play as a unit and that it is not always that good that far 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:04.380
 we have to increase the bargain, but this is why the city is 

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:07.330
 try to reach a certain level of winner 

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:10.900
 Ajax played a good first half and immediately won an excellent 

00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:13.809
 played ball 

00:02:13.809 --> 00:02:15.619
 for his first shot 

00:02:15.619 --> 00:02:18.619
 the spokeswoman 

00:02:21.639 --> 00:02:24.129
 6 this year 

00:02:24.129 --> 00:02:27.129
 every year via the Mediterranean 

00:02:27.869 --> 00:02:30.869
 proof that the Football Act is never again to the extent necessary 

00:02:31.449 --> 00:02:32.319
 Yes 

00:02:32.319 --> 00:02:35.999
 Ultimately, it is of course a certain confidence in yourself 

00:02:35.999 --> 00:02:37.339
 but again 

00:02:37.339 --> 00:02:38.359
 the teams don't 

00:02:38.359 --> 00:02:41.359
 then everything will be much easier 

00:02:42.509 --> 00:02:47.349
 that of the baere flurries again forms itself of certainly the accident succeeds 

00:02:47.349 --> 00:02:50.569
 This failed to extend that good half to the city of Ajax suffered a lot 

00:02:50.569 --> 00:02:53.389
 ball loss in the second half and colette put a lot of pressure 

00:02:53.389 --> 00:02:56.389
 it led to a number of chances for the equalizer 

00:02:58.689 --> 00:03:02.749
 because they had had a great deal of threat, but now we feel that we have the graces 

00:03:02.749 --> 00:03:04.799
 and so much more info 

00:03:04.799 --> 00:03:08.349
 you just want to see that we can win for nine minutes 

00:03:08.349 --> 00:03:09.909
 we can do that too 

00:03:09.909 --> 00:03:11.439
 that happened at events 

00:03:11.439 --> 00:03:13.199
 how to ensure that the 

00:03:13.199 --> 00:03:16.019
 cells could come back 

00:03:16.019 --> 00:03:18.259
 we favor 

00:03:18.259 --> 00:03:20.179
 by indicating 

00:03:20.179 --> 00:03:23.469
 the moments when you just lose the grip that you then 

00:03:23.469 --> 00:03:27.359
 weirdly simple we have to let a player go more like a ball 

00:03:27.359 --> 00:03:29.369
 I think playing 

00:03:29.369 --> 00:03:32.369
 then comes the strict thinking back 

00:03:32.929 --> 00:03:34.669
 that is winning then 

00:03:34.669 --> 00:03:37.709
 yes the runners are with the young players 

00:03:37.709 --> 00:03:39.419
 the government is this news 

00:03:39.419 --> 00:03:42.419
 it is also possible to handle each other a bit 

00:03:43.149 --> 00:03:46.149
 I think they can also take a firm step there 

00:03:49.019 --> 00:03:50.750
 a lot is said about a young team 

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:53.230
 and also the experiences that the links would make 

00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:56.650
 What exactly is experience then in the football game experience is that you have one 

00:03:57.949 --> 00:03:59.419
 the game 

00:03:59.419 --> 00:04:03.829
 keune can actually read a broom through the second-hand smoke now it needs a moment 

00:04:04.569 --> 00:04:07.779
 played in a different way by a must give 

00:04:07.779 --> 00:04:11.670
 for example if you see that we get the opponent's door 

00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:15.470
 that you forgot to be disturbed with it, especially in outerwear in between 

00:04:16.419 --> 00:04:17.910
 to make the 

00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:20.209
 about the moments that I like south 

00:04:20.209 --> 00:04:23.590
 no live three four times in a row here simple ball loss that we again 

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:26.679
 I myself almost never had what I am always under pressure from 

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:30.669
 yes it will be able to go back to basics for a while 

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:36.599
 if you wanted to give a difficult ball a halifax turn, cherish it 

00:04:36.599 --> 00:04:40.580
 possession of the ball more that said that is no longer the experience reading one of 

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:42.400
 the game where needed at that time 

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:45.379
 maybe that really is 

00:04:45.379 --> 00:04:48.379
 yes she gets a lot of bet was playing lots of games 

00:04:49.169 --> 00:04:52.870
 and so the young team will get a crash course in adult football this week 

00:04:53.979 --> 00:04:57.319
 that is an advantage that the course play go through this type of competition 

00:04:57.319 --> 00:04:59.240
 play those steps 

00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:00.809
 people do 

00:05:00.809 --> 00:05:04.210
 of course you have already made those extra steps one 

00:05:04.210 --> 00:05:07.650
 only gallant often also the costs sometimes of the 

00:05:07.650 --> 00:05:08.310
 of points
