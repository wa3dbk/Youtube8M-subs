00:00:04.210 --> 00:00:11.440
 and again zombies 

00:00:08.830 --> 00:00:13.150
 Before you is playing a game telling about 

00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:15.550
 regular local flash some 

00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:17.619
 imagine infection 

00:00:15.550 --> 00:00:20.619
 several hand-made islands 

00:00:17.619 --> 00:00:22.720
 crammed with their walking dead you're alone in 

00:00:20.619 --> 00:00:26.200
 several survivors are required of you 

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:28.960
 yes everything just does not die to die happily 

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:30.820
 in this game itâ€™s hard why so about this we 

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:34.059
 tell in the review how to survive 

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:36.519
 from playground.ru in contrast to the set 

00:00:34.059 --> 00:00:38.379
 other games on the same topic how to survive 

00:00:36.519 --> 00:00:40.480
 is a three-dimensional action from 

00:00:38.379 --> 00:00:42.760
 third person camera is suspended somewhere 

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:44.320
 under the ceiling despite this character 

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:46.269
 would manage it directly with 

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:48.039
 classic combinations all 

00:00:46.269 --> 00:00:50.289
 the mouse here is used to review 

00:00:48.039 --> 00:00:52.359
 press the left key beat or 

00:00:50.289 --> 00:00:53.289
 shoot press the right key 

00:00:52.359 --> 00:00:54.489
 take aim 

00:00:53.289 --> 00:00:56.649
 aiming by the way works 

00:00:54.489 --> 00:00:57.760
 automatically and on consoles and on 

00:00:56.649 --> 00:01:00.999
 personal computers 

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:03.640
 apparently to make it easier to survive and easier 

00:01:00.999 --> 00:01:04.750
 there is nowhere to put the numeric storyline 

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:07.510
 the campaign tells some 

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:09.369
 completely wild story incomprehensible 

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:11.200
 way the main character gets on the country 

00:01:09.369 --> 00:01:13.149
 island filled with zombies 

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:15.729
 besides zombies on this very island there 

00:01:13.149 --> 00:01:17.770
 a couple of ngc who want to remove from there 

00:01:15.729 --> 00:01:20.680
 for this they need to find parts for 

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:23.649
 Aircraft that's basically all there is a 

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:26.500
 wait there is something else first 

00:01:23.649 --> 00:01:28.719
 the island is not one of them here 4 moved to 

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:30.280
 between them on the boat and on one of 

00:01:28.719 --> 00:01:32.860
 the islands live a strange guy named 

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:34.950
 whom did this kalak write a guide on 

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:37.210
 survival in a zombie apocalypse 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:39.610
 pages of this guide containing 

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:42.810
 incredibly useless information you 

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:42.810
 will be found everywhere 

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:50.040
 kovax rurk very furious 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:52.350
 see you and waka waka herself he says 

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:54.630
 with a German accent is very sad joking and 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:57.630
 all kind of show that he knows something 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:59.220
 what is the bank not supposed to know and yet 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:00.630
 on these islands lives talking 

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:02.130
 a monkey named copco 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:04.229
 the monkey will give you side 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:08.390
 quests and reward for their execution 

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:08.390
 from all this I want to cry 

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:16.020
 despite its name cold rips off 

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:17.820
 this is not a game of survival of this game and 

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:21.060
 methodically pressing the buttons 

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:23.940
 clicked took down the jar of zombies clicked again 

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:25.590
 and another head off demolished repeat it in 

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:27.990
 a thousand times that's the end of the game 

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:30.300
 part of this very process of nose heads 

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:32.400
 quite interesting right how to burst 

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:34.260
 bubbles in plastic packaging 

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:36.510
 it maintains interest throughout 

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:38.760
 long hours somewhere in the middle of a bathrobe 

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:41.400
 Sarbaev you will understand that the game you already 

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:42.270
 tired of you already followed all the local 

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:44.760
 tiny islands 

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:46.680
 saw all that you can see done 

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:49.170
 low monotonous quests and thoroughly 

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:51.600
 zadolbalis but go out anyway 

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:53.700
 it would be desirable because the head of the zombie 

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:54.210
 explode too fun for everyone 

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:56.340
 quit 

00:02:54.210 --> 00:02:58.950
 seriously at first you will only 

00:02:56.340 --> 00:03:01.170
 wooden stick cool stick can 

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:03.210
 even seem that cooler and nothing to be 

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:05.550
 can not then you find layouts that 

00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:08.100
 from the stick is no different and then 

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:10.170
 how lucky on the islands Valya is a whole 

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:12.390
 a bunch of garbage from which you can collect 

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:14.400
 every killer lamp gun 

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:16.710
 rifle shotgun automatic chainsaw or 

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:18.870
 all onions are equally good 

00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:21.120
 suited to blow heads all 

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:22.520
 except a shotgun when they start on you 

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:25.170
 attack zombie body armor and helmets 

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:27.210
 shotgun will become useless you him 

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:29.130
 disassemble and assemble the rifle which 

00:03:27.210 --> 00:03:31.770
 will be able to shoot the heads of zombie helmets 

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:34.260
 the hull casco rolled down the bushes again 

00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:36.750
 broads and head exploded more and more 

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:38.340
 do not craft anything and so good on 

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:40.440
 actually crafting how to survive 

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:42.540
 done well much better than 

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:44.310
 slurred don't need a pumping system you 

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:46.470
 can collect armor make a cocktail 

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:48.330
 molotova explosive first aid kits improved 

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:50.400
 arrows for the bow and some others 

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:53.310
 lack of detail gadgets not 

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:55.290
 felt the islands are packed with them to the eyeballs 

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:57.450
 you will always have a full supply of ammunition 

00:03:55.290 --> 00:04:00.240
 a dozen water bottle kits and and yes 

00:03:57.450 --> 00:04:02.280
 by the way almost forgot how to survive you 

00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:04.980
 need to eat drink and sleep not to die 

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:07.140
 don't worry don't die island here 

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:09.960
 heavenly so there are indicators of hunger and 

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:12.900
 thirsty you will forget house very soon 

00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:15.240
 there is a change of day and night at night 

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:17.400
 you are attacked by special zombies what is their 

00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:18.040
 feature we did not understand yes they 

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:20.830
 fast 

00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:22.750
 but they fear the light of the very start of the game 

00:04:20.830 --> 00:04:25.240
 you will be a flashlight endless battery 

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:26.920
 so these most special zombies will 

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:29.230
 die like flies in starling rooms 

00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:32.590
 lamp is much more dangerous here deer 

00:04:29.230 --> 00:04:34.720
 zombies and ostriches zombies ostriches in general 

00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:36.760
 death but you can cope with them 

00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:39.160
 pretty quickly salvation does not differ 

00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:39.970
 piranha the main thing do not meddle unnecessarily 

00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:41.980
 in the swamp 

00:04:39.970 --> 00:04:43.690
 the creators of how to survive have chosen 

00:04:41.980 --> 00:04:46.000
 completely wrong name for 

00:04:43.690 --> 00:04:48.670
 your game does not need to survive here 

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:50.980
 no need to call them how the 

00:04:48.670 --> 00:04:53.140
 hell zombie wanted t may 2013 

00:04:50.980 --> 00:04:55.600
 it would be more logical to recommend the game as 

00:04:53.140 --> 00:04:57.850
 survival simulator we will not 

00:04:55.600 --> 00:05:00.100
 as a fun action with the presence of 

00:04:57.850 --> 00:05:01.900
 cooperative mode is quite even 

00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:04.180
 despite all the sadness of what is happening and 

00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:06.520
 cloned environment is something in this 

00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:09.130
 the game is already there stadium dabolim little 

00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:11.680
 until October 31, you can buy and only 

00:05:09.130 --> 00:05:14.740
 for 7 dollars and justify this price 

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:18.210
 entirely and entirely on this all good luck and 

00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:18.210
 see you on playground.ru
