00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.600
 hi to all those giuseppe boys 

00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:05.339
 rooms welcome to this test video 

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:06.779
 of this the second video I do 

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:08.460
 as for the missions on 

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:09.990
 moon so in case you don't have 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:11.580
 seen the previous video 

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:13.590
 I recommend you go and see why 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:15.480
 you will understand how we arrived here in 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:17.460
 Meanwhile, here is a fallen guardian 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:22.050
 I have to evoke the specter we see 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:22.320
 who tells us ok who recently died 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:25.590
 He knows 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:27.449
 the black gate takes so long for 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:30.150
 analyze it we do something we have 

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:33.120
 reawakened the real the split that there is 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:34.320
 separate ok guys as you can see yes 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:35.910
 the gate is open 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:38.280
 I'll tell you a little about what it was 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:40.230
 shown in the scene that unfortunately for 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:42.809
 Copyright reasons I had to cut 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:46.350
 in practice we have analyzed the 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:48.840
 corpse and I think it 's just one 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:50.399
 sort of trap as expected indeed 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:52.140
 once analyzed the corpse is 

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:54.059
 appearance a person on a kind of 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:56.550
 cliff type up there which then disappeared 

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:59.129
 suddenly I think it's a 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:01.559
 girl and then just opened on 

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:03.420
 gate from which precisely we are then 

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:06.000
 we have to remove then we respect 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:08.549
 he eliminated a moment that we eliminate 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.200
 they too had to go where he went to 

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:11.400
 finish building skipped done something 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:13.170
 such 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:15.810
 that's really fucking so I have to 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:18.500
 keep shooting him until he goes to 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:21.060
 soil among other things it looks like it can 

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:23.250
 imagine heal cliffs in 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:24.630
 italy i don't know his life 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:27.470
 however it recharges let's put it in 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:30.590
 these terms therefore pension 

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:32.690
 primary progress well because I got out 

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:34.670
 what the hell I've done wrong with 

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:36.650
 water guys have to recharge mine 

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:38.900
 life because this is a point from which 

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:40.790
 I cannot then go back 

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:42.170
 in the sense that once dead 

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:44.420
 I basically have to do it all over again 

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:46.910
 then recharge and I'm ready 

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:49.820
 I have to concentrate on the attack 

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:51.770
 don't say you should n't escape from me 

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:53.450
 really nothing any idea 

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:56.030
 dough so difficult it becomes 

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:59.090
 hard to even talk slut 

00:01:56.030 --> 00:02:01.070
 miseriaccia where I see you but here it is 

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:05.200
 eliminated charging are ready 

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:08.899
 on the attack on we say that in practice if 

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:10.670
 you are like it is not that you are god if mine 

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:13.910
 it goes more than anything else to this other lace 

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:17.000
 preacher m stage 22 really good ce 

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:18.680
 two of these are ok 1 eliminated 

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.800
 also deleted the other ok I think I have 

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:23.930
 got a lot of things here indeed 

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:26.720
 vector oath really nothing 

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:28.550
 bad attention that she takes some 

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:32.959
 position modified complete direct 

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:35.900
 pure appearance therefore finds the spectrum of the 

00:02:32.959 --> 00:02:38.570
 lost guardian we say we are in 

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:39.680
 practice in the base limits therefore it is not 

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:42.650
 that we did so much 

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:44.420
 nice anyway I'm ready to do 

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:47.390
 face any kind of difficulty 

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:48.830
 here is one out and then there are all 

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:51.200
 the others 

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:54.170
 here they are who to that one rock progeny 

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:56.989
 of is the cabbage cabbage ganau table 

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:58.760
 wait the cabbage reload cabbage that 

00:02:56.989 --> 00:03:01.760
 fuck it's all people away from here 

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:02.930
 must active catch up guys i am 

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:06.560
 too much in difficulty 

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:08.769
 we see the sore friend does not seem not 

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:12.090
 it seems he doesn't seem to be seen 

00:03:08.769 --> 00:03:13.830
 let's see respect it 

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:17.069
 some miserable boys this is nice 

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:18.120
 door we say I have to do a lot of 

00:03:17.069 --> 00:03:20.310
 caution 

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:22.400
 we ask if he dies we succeed in 

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:25.290
 take that aura away from it 

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:26.160
 I have to get closer just use a 

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:28.260
 most powerful weapon 

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:30.720
 let's see if he dies so don't boys these 

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:33.870
 poison doors because there was written poison 

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:35.069
 to the left of charging some more 

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:38.670
 I think it would be a fight rather 

00:03:35.069 --> 00:03:40.860
 long let's see let's take away the 

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:42.450
 barrier but the attack resumes 

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:46.519
 recharge only 

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:49.319
 let's go here go here here's where it starts 

00:03:46.519 --> 00:03:51.720
 force I can throw something or even 

00:03:49.319 --> 00:03:55.079
 this force can use it if 

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:57.120
 this was eliminated providentially 

00:03:55.079 --> 00:03:58.860
 boys attack 

00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:00.780
 let's see what i can do now because i'm 

00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:03.829
 dying poison no 

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:06.780
 let's see what the ok spectrum animates here 

00:04:03.829 --> 00:04:08.879
 mission completed new grimoire card 

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:11.700
 got something else is dead but I can access 

00:04:08.879 --> 00:04:14.459
 to some memories these caves 

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:16.620
 go down for km the hive is 

00:04:14.459 --> 00:04:17.959
 assembling an army and getting ready to 

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:20.170
 invade the earth 

00:04:17.959 --> 00:04:22.880
 we must stop them 

00:04:20.170 --> 00:04:24.440
 ok i guess it's not one of the news 

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:26.000
 best we could have in 

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:28.610
 this last period is what I can't 

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:30.020
 proceed there is a barrier is visible ok 

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:31.730
 so i guess the only thing is that 

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:33.020
 we can do at the moment is precisely 

00:04:31.730 --> 00:04:36.230
 end the mission 

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:38.780
 and here we are progress we are almost there for 

00:04:36.230 --> 00:04:41.710
 unlock the dispersed grid and then 

00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:44.060
 reward activity kills 73 and later 

00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:45.830
 no rewards of any kind 

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:48.880
 we have a vector oath 

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:51.500
 ghost dead so guys let's continue 

00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:53.330
 we headed to the square of 

00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:53.840
 tower in such a way that what everyone is 

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:55.970
 dance 

00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:57.919
 look at how happy everyone is we talk 

00:04:55.970 --> 00:05:00.350
 all together then we see the other moves 

00:04:57.919 --> 00:05:02.510
 here I can just sit ok then I can 

00:05:00.350 --> 00:05:04.669
 greet others and then see a 

00:05:02.510 --> 00:05:06.830
 at this point, to indicate the way rather 

00:05:04.669 --> 00:05:08.360
 scorned someone so we see a 

00:05:06.830 --> 00:05:10.040
 attain to reach receives 

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:11.419
 reward talks to the speaker for 

00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:13.400
 receive a reward 

00:05:11.419 --> 00:05:15.800
 so guys we come to see him 

00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:19.820
 where I believe I should continue to choose 

00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:22.370
 if then it is the one who spans compliments 

00:05:19.820 --> 00:05:24.500
 we must keep our own clean 

00:05:22.370 --> 00:05:26.030
 natural habitat that then natural up to 

00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:29.930
 certainly seen as they are 

00:05:26.030 --> 00:05:32.210
 modified bye, do n't say hello, here we are 

00:05:29.930 --> 00:05:34.970
 I believe we have arrived 

00:05:32.210 --> 00:05:36.979
 we see a little here we are here I believe of 

00:05:34.970 --> 00:05:38.620
 to have arrived in the area very much 

00:05:36.979 --> 00:05:41.080
 cool to the boys environment 

00:05:38.620 --> 00:05:43.660
 expect your return 

00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:46.520
 here it is, the speaker then we interact 

00:05:43.660 --> 00:05:48.530
 I think I can do something back 

00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:51.140
 spectrum the hive is a fearsome enemy 

00:05:48.530 --> 00:05:52.910
 suitably armed with an order of 

00:05:51.140 --> 00:05:56.510
 arguments to be brought by the gunsmith of 

00:05:52.910 --> 00:05:58.700
 cough so we accept an ok essay 

00:05:56.510 --> 00:06:01.340
 I have to understand let's say what it consists of 

00:05:58.700 --> 00:06:03.770
 these are all these cloaks for 

00:06:01.340 --> 00:06:06.710
 these are emblems from though 

00:06:03.770 --> 00:06:08.510
 rather figs all tell us safe 

00:06:06.710 --> 00:06:09.129
 sure you find yourself safe not quiet 

00:06:08.510 --> 00:06:10.659
 have 

00:06:09.129 --> 00:06:12.669
 you don't have to be afraid then we have to 

00:06:10.659 --> 00:06:16.119
 also go to the gunsmith I think 

00:06:12.669 --> 00:06:18.129
 just be it always in the area you see can 

00:06:16.119 --> 00:06:20.409
 however have some familiarity in the 

00:06:18.129 --> 00:06:23.499
 complex with I do not say commands but 

00:06:20.409 --> 00:06:27.999
 at least for the way the is set up 

00:06:23.499 --> 00:06:30.989
 game type connor greets tough guy that 

00:06:27.999 --> 00:06:33.969
 he is called a specific réclame 

00:06:30.989 --> 00:06:37.149
 therefore he receives reward I can no longer 

00:06:33.969 --> 00:06:39.309
 running still makes you really run there 

00:06:37.149 --> 00:06:41.110
 he wanted a run I know that among other things she 

00:06:39.309 --> 00:06:42.669
 he is not the gunsmith and administrator 

00:06:41.110 --> 00:06:49.419
 because they had to go to her too 

00:06:42.669 --> 00:06:50.399
 let's see how you collect size drawn all over 

00:06:49.419 --> 00:06:53.080
 done 

00:06:50.399 --> 00:06:53.639
 let's say it's not one of the choices 

00:06:53.080 --> 00:06:55.959
 best 

00:06:53.639 --> 00:06:57.669
 clearly there is no words 

00:06:55.959 --> 00:07:01.839
 choice of best words for or anyway 

00:06:57.669 --> 00:07:03.339
 it doesn't matter from the boxes it interacts 

00:07:01.839 --> 00:07:07.059
 of course, to help me choose one 

00:07:03.339 --> 00:07:09.519
 reward cabbage what bomb rifle is 

00:07:07.059 --> 00:07:11.589
 fusion rifle i think guys that 

00:07:09.519 --> 00:07:13.269
 I will choose the fusion rifle it seems 

00:07:11.589 --> 00:07:14.740
 to be really cool 

00:07:13.269 --> 00:07:16.449
 meanwhile there are other weapons 

00:07:14.740 --> 00:07:18.429
 available here I recommend 

00:07:16.449 --> 00:07:19.959
 advise me of weapons if you have from 

00:07:18.429 --> 00:07:22.269
 advise why it could for me 

00:07:19.959 --> 00:07:23.800
 to be fundamental to update 

00:07:22.269 --> 00:07:26.139
 a little my inventory in the meantime 

00:07:23.800 --> 00:07:28.319
 we also have something else here that there 

00:07:26.139 --> 00:07:31.240
 have to communicate let's see it interacts 

00:07:28.319 --> 00:07:32.649
 we see active there are no cuts and 

00:07:31.240 --> 00:07:34.599
 traces there are problems that i 

00:07:32.649 --> 00:07:36.849
 so guardians can solve oh well 

00:07:34.599 --> 00:07:39.129
 we accept all moon artifacts 

00:07:36.849 --> 00:07:41.740
 I believe that they can then complete it 

00:07:39.129 --> 00:07:43.149
 these pits already bought you ok then 

00:07:41.740 --> 00:07:45.099
 I have to go away nothing else to do 

00:07:43.149 --> 00:07:46.749
 so guys this video south foreigners 

00:07:45.099 --> 00:07:48.399
 it ends here I recommend you let me 

00:07:46.749 --> 00:07:50.169
 know in the coming days what kind of 

00:07:48.399 --> 00:07:52.149
 video you want just south of yourself 

00:07:50.169 --> 00:07:53.979
 some main mission if you want 

00:07:52.149 --> 00:07:55.779
 see some party if multiplayer 

00:07:53.979 --> 00:07:57.699
 I recommend you it's up to you guys
