excludes<00:03:14.940> food<00:03:15.270> and<00:03:15.569> energy<00:03:15.720> this<00:03:16.500> is<00:03:16.709> a

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:16.740 
excludes food and energy this is a

00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:17.930 
excludes food and energy this is a
problem<00:03:17.160> when<00:03:17.280> we<00:03:17.400> say<00:03:17.610> that<00:03:17.790> that's

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:17.940 
problem when we say that that's

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:20.510 
problem when we say that that's
contained<00:03:18.420> because<00:03:18.540> no<00:03:18.870> one<00:03:19.050> in<00:03:19.170> America<00:03:19.680> buys

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:20.520 
contained because no one in America buys

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:23.240 
contained because no one in America buys
stuff<00:03:20.970> that<00:03:21.239> excludes<00:03:21.630> food<00:03:21.840> and<00:03:22.020> energy<00:03:22.250> well

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:23.250

trouble and he says there's going to be

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:36.290 
trouble and he says there's going to be
increased<00:03:33.870> bank<00:03:34.620> failure<00:03:35.040> what<00:03:35.700> it<00:03:36.180> was

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:36.300 
increased bank failure what it was

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:36.979

likely fail and that caused markets to

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:42.920 
likely fail and that caused markets to
be<00:03:40.950> very<00:03:41.130> concerned<00:03:42.030> by<00:03:42.269> the<00:03:42.330> end<00:03:42.570> of<00:03:42.690> the<00:03:42.780> week
