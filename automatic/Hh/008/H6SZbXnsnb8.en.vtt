00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:35.549 
but then I kind of figured maybe that

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:37.219 
but then I kind of figured maybe that

since the engines as explained in

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:48.260 
since the engines as explained in
episode<00:01:45.030> 3<00:01:45.329> part<00:01:46.200> 3<00:01:46.470> or<00:01:47.189> anything<00:01:47.729> was<00:01:47.909> part<00:01:48.119> 3

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:51.140 
yeah part three that are you gonna
working

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:51.150 
working

00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:53.000 
working
and<00:01:51.720> I<00:01:51.990> honestly<00:01:52.260> don't<00:01:52.560> know<00:01:52.680> what<00:01:52.830> at<00:01:52.950> the

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:53.010 
and I honestly don't know what at the

00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:54.290 
and I honestly don't know what at the
light<00:01:53.190> source<00:01:53.400> they<00:01:53.580> could<00:01:53.730> use<00:01:53.910> like<00:01:54.120> maybe

00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:54.300 
light source they could use like maybe

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:56.450 
light source they could use like maybe
one<00:01:54.480> of<00:01:54.570> those<00:01:54.690> huge<00:01:55.110> ones<00:01:55.410> but<00:01:56.160> that<00:01:56.340> would<00:01:56.430> be

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:56.460 
one of those huge ones but that would be

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:57.830 
one of those huge ones but that would be
really<00:01:56.910> awkward<00:01:57.120> to<00:01:57.360> carry<00:01:57.690> around

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 
really awkward to carry around

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:00.440 
really awkward to carry around
everywhere<00:01:58.440> wouldn't<00:01:58.800> it<00:01:58.860> and<00:01:59.210> since<00:02:00.210> these

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450 
everywhere wouldn't it and since these

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:02.570 
everywhere wouldn't it and since these
girls<00:02:00.720> are<00:02:00.900> only<00:02:00.990> defeated<00:02:01.410> by<00:02:01.560> light<00:02:01.860> you

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:02.580 
girls are only defeated by light you

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:04.910 
girls are only defeated by light you
know<00:02:02.750> it<00:02:03.750> was<00:02:03.870> kind<00:02:04.110> of<00:02:04.140> running<00:02:04.290> into<00:02:04.500> a<00:02:04.620> dead

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:04.920 
know it was kind of running into a dead

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:06.740 
know it was kind of running into a dead
end<00:02:04.950> so<00:02:05.340> I<00:02:05.370> decided<00:02:05.760> just<00:02:05.850> to<00:02:06.150> end<00:02:06.420> it<00:02:06.630> right

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:06.750 
end so I decided just to end it right

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:08.660 
end so I decided just to end it right
there<00:02:06.960> I<00:02:07.170> can<00:02:07.740> show<00:02:07.920> a<00:02:07.950> couple<00:02:08.280> of<00:02:08.340> scenes

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:08.670 
there I can show a couple of scenes

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:10.969 
there I can show a couple of scenes
right<00:02:09.180> now<00:02:09.330> but<00:02:10.050> they're<00:02:10.229> not<00:02:10.350> completed<00:02:10.920> in

00:02:10.969 --> 00:02:10.979 
right now but they're not completed in

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:12.860 
right now but they're not completed in
any<00:02:11.100> way<00:02:11.310> and<00:02:11.610> maybe<00:02:12.120> this<00:02:12.300> is<00:02:12.450> what<00:02:12.570> you<00:02:12.750> can

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:12.870 
any way and maybe this is what you can

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:15.230 
any way and maybe this is what you can
maybe<00:02:13.530> this<00:02:13.800> is<00:02:13.920> one<00:02:14.070> of<00:02:14.100> them<00:02:14.250> I<00:02:14.610> guess<00:02:15.060> this

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:15.240 
maybe this is one of them I guess this

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:17.450 
maybe this is one of them I guess this
is<00:02:15.390> virile<00:02:15.810> I<00:02:15.990> okay<00:02:16.950> sorry

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:17.460 
is virile I okay sorry

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:20.570 
is virile I okay sorry

00:04:55.670 --> 00:04:55.680 
really like I said earlier it was only a

00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:57.380 
really like I said earlier it was only a
rough<00:04:55.890> draft<00:04:56.250> I<00:04:56.520> didn't<00:04:56.790> go<00:04:56.880> back<00:04:57.030> to<00:04:57.060> like

00:04:57.380 --> 00:04:57.390 
rough draft I didn't go back to like

00:04:57.390 --> 00:04:59.690 
rough draft I didn't go back to like
editing<00:04:57.840> the<00:04:58.410> better<00:04:58.620> sound<00:04:59.400> effects<00:04:59.640> that

00:04:59.690 --> 00:04:59.700 
editing the better sound effects that

00:04:59.700 --> 00:05:00.470 
editing the better sound effects that
could<00:04:59.910> have<00:05:00.030> been<00:05:00.150> better

00:05:00.470 --> 00:05:00.480 
could have been better

00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:03.740 
could have been better
all<00:05:00.720> that<00:05:01.050> stuff<00:05:01.290> trimming<00:05:01.740> but<00:05:02.580> um<00:05:03.090> you<00:05:03.720> know

00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:03.750 
all that stuff trimming but um you know

00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:05.630 
all that stuff trimming but um you know
I<00:05:03.840> just<00:05:04.080> decided<00:05:04.380> to<00:05:04.530> cancel<00:05:04.710> like<00:05:05.370> I<00:05:05.460> said

00:05:05.630 --> 00:05:05.640 
I just decided to cancel like I said

00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:07.520 
I just decided to cancel like I said
earlier<00:05:05.970> because<00:05:06.420> I<00:05:06.720> felt<00:05:07.110> like<00:05:07.200> it's<00:05:07.320> gone<00:05:07.470> on

00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:07.530 
earlier because I felt like it's gone on

00:05:07.530 --> 00:05:09.620 
earlier because I felt like it's gone on
for<00:05:07.650> way<00:05:07.950> too<00:05:08.010> long<00:05:08.190> I<00:05:08.610> think<00:05:08.640> the<00:05:08.880> plot<00:05:09.180> I've

00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:09.630 
for way too long I think the plot I've

00:05:09.630 --> 00:05:13.190 
for way too long I think the plot I've
run<00:05:10.140> into<00:05:10.260> a<00:05:10.350> dead<00:05:10.710> end<00:05:10.740> with<00:05:11.040> a<00:05:11.070> plot<00:05:11.400> and<00:05:12.200> any

00:05:13.190 --> 00:05:13.200 
run into a dead end with a plot and any

00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:15.080 
run into a dead end with a plot and any
other<00:05:13.410> reason<00:05:13.650> that<00:05:13.680> her<00:05:13.890> God<00:05:14.070> you<00:05:14.640> know<00:05:14.790> you

00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:15.090 
other reason that her God you know you

00:05:15.090 --> 00:05:17.720 
other reason that her God you know you
know<00:05:15.240> why<00:05:15.530> so<00:05:16.530> I<00:05:16.860> think<00:05:16.980> you<00:05:17.250> guys<00:05:17.370> all<00:05:17.430> for
