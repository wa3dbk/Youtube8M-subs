this<00:04:09.090> particular<00:04:09.450> watch<00:04:09.860> the<00:04:10.860> band<00:04:11.010> itself

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:11.190 
this particular watch the band itself

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:13.790 
this particular watch the band itself
not<00:04:12.060> the<00:04:12.120> band<00:04:12.540> all<00:04:12.750> time<00:04:12.960> low<00:04:13.170> but<00:04:13.410> the<00:04:13.530> watch

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:13.800 
not the band all time low but the watch

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:17.300 
not the band all time low but the watch
band<00:04:14.190> is<00:04:14.430> a<00:04:14.460> gloss<00:04:15.300> material<00:04:15.930> so<00:04:16.590> it<00:04:16.980> has<00:04:17.280> a

00:04:17.300 --> 00:04:17.310 
band is a gloss material so it has a

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:19.160 
band is a gloss material so it has a
little<00:04:17.670> bit<00:04:17.850> of<00:04:17.910> a<00:04:18.030> sheen<00:04:18.330> to<00:04:18.390> it<00:04:18.630> which<00:04:19.080> i

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:19.170 
little bit of a sheen to it which i

00:04:19.170 --> 00:04:21.229 
little bit of a sheen to it which i
think<00:04:19.230> is<00:04:19.410> also<00:04:19.590> a<00:04:19.739> really<00:04:20.130> nice<00:04:20.340> touch<00:04:20.670> we
