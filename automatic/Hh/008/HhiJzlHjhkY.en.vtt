Lumia<00:03:39.090> lamp<00:03:39.479> thing<00:03:39.870> which<00:03:40.500> I'm<00:03:40.680> fine<00:03:40.829> with

00:03:40.879 --> 00:03:40.889 
Lumia lamp thing which I'm fine with

00:03:40.889 --> 00:03:42.409 
Lumia lamp thing which I'm fine with
that<00:03:41.040> getting<00:03:41.459> cuz<00:03:41.579> I'm<00:03:41.699> really<00:03:42.000> a<00:03:42.030> phase<00:03:42.269> in

00:03:42.409 --> 00:03:42.419 
that getting cuz I'm really a phase in

00:03:42.419 --> 00:03:43.759 
that getting cuz I'm really a phase in
my<00:03:42.449> room<00:03:42.659> for<00:03:42.690> don't<00:03:43.019> like<00:03:43.169> that<00:03:43.379> and<00:03:43.680> there

00:03:43.759 --> 00:03:43.769 
my room for don't like that and there

00:03:43.769 --> 00:03:45.439 
my room for don't like that and there
were<00:03:43.889> a<00:03:43.919> couple<00:03:43.979> of<00:03:44.310> arcs<00:03:44.669> that<00:03:44.849> went<00:03:45.090> out<00:03:45.209> to

00:03:45.439 --> 00:03:45.449 
were a couple of arcs that went out to

00:03:45.449 --> 00:03:48.530 
were a couple of arcs that went out to
certain<00:03:45.979> readers<00:03:46.979> or<00:03:47.280> certain<00:03:47.609> subscribers

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:48.540 
certain readers or certain subscribers

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:50.509 
certain readers or certain subscribers
and<00:03:48.870> stuff<00:03:49.079> like<00:03:49.229> that<00:03:49.290> so<00:03:49.739> that<00:03:50.250> would<00:03:50.430> have

00:03:50.509 --> 00:03:50.519 
and stuff like that so that would have

00:03:50.519 --> 00:03:51.830 
and stuff like that so that would have
been<00:03:50.609> cool<00:03:50.669> but<00:03:50.879> it's<00:03:51.329> okay<00:03:51.540> because<00:03:51.569> I've

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:51.840 
been cool but it's okay because I've

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:53.270 
been cool but it's okay because I've
gotten<00:03:52.139> some<00:03:52.409> of<00:03:52.440> the<00:03:52.560> bonus<00:03:52.859> stuff<00:03:53.010> in<00:03:53.190> the

00:03:53.270 --> 00:03:53.280 
gotten some of the bonus stuff in the

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:55.849 
gotten some of the bonus stuff in the
past<00:03:53.459> so<00:03:53.790> I'm<00:03:54.030> guessing<00:03:54.959> it's<00:03:55.290> not<00:03:55.530> my<00:03:55.739> turn

00:03:55.849 --> 00:03:55.859 
past so I'm guessing it's not my turn

00:03:55.859 --> 00:03:57.649 
past so I'm guessing it's not my turn
yet<00:03:56.310> although<00:03:56.609> they<00:03:56.849> say<00:03:57.000> it's<00:03:57.120> like<00:03:57.239> randomly

00:03:57.649 --> 00:03:57.659 
yet although they say it's like randomly

00:03:57.659 --> 00:03:59.880 
yet although they say it's like randomly
chosen<00:03:57.989> but<00:03:58.260> I'm<00:03:58.409> sure<00:03:58.620> it'd<00:03:58.919> be<00:03:58.979> unlikely

00:03:59.880 --> 00:03:59.890 
chosen but I'm sure it'd be unlikely

00:03:59.890 --> 00:04:01.590 
chosen but I'm sure it'd be unlikely
for<00:04:00.040> me<00:04:00.130> to<00:04:00.220> get<00:04:00.340> a<00:04:00.370> twice<00:04:00.640> in<00:04:00.819> one<00:04:00.940> year<00:04:01.000> yeah

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:01.600 
for me to get a twice in one year yeah

00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:03.750 
for me to get a twice in one year yeah
