00:00:58.450 --> 00:00:58.460 
deceleration so the brain will move

00:00:58.460 --> 00:00:59.919 
deceleration so the brain will move
against<00:00:58.850> the<00:00:58.879> cranium<00:00:59.420> then<00:00:59.570> the<00:00:59.660> crane<00:00:59.899> is

00:00:59.919 --> 00:00:59.929 
against the cranium then the crane is

00:00:59.929 --> 00:01:01.540 
against the cranium then the crane is
going<00:01:00.050> to<00:01:00.170> move<00:01:00.320> against<00:01:00.620> something<00:01:00.890> else<00:01:01.219> and

going to move against something else and

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:03.310 
going to move against something else and

recommend<00:03:40.640> the<00:03:40.700> full<00:03:40.910> face<00:03:41.120> helmet<00:03:41.540> because

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:41.630 
recommend the full face helmet because

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:43.780 
recommend the full face helmet because
it<00:03:41.750> doesn't<00:03:41.960> just<00:03:42.020> protect<00:03:42.260> the<00:03:42.650> cranium<00:03:43.280> but

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:43.790 
it doesn't just protect the cranium but

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:45.040 
it doesn't just protect the cranium but
also<00:03:43.940> protects<00:03:44.330> the<00:03:44.450> rest<00:03:44.630> of<00:03:44.720> the<00:03:44.780> face<00:03:44.990> the

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:45.050 
also protects the rest of the face the

00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:47.710 
also protects the rest of the face the
eyes<00:03:45.530> the<00:03:45.950> nose<00:03:45.980> the<00:03:46.160> teeth<00:03:46.640> the<00:03:47.150> cosmetics

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:52.040 
more long-term recovery time so the
