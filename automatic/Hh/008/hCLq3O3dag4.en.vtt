00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:09.330
 actually to the exit having so 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:10.650
 at the moment when the icm goes 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:12.240

 random striker is also called 

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:19.290
 with which I just work together on this 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:21.210
 moment and yes that is just the whole 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:23.670
 ideas we place the lid throw them 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:25.920

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:30.090
 are gone then the other goes through them 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:32.700
 have now done an order of extra 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:36.240
 fat first after that action reaction 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:38.280
 then dash and then I then have 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:39.780
 four minutes four minutes to this 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:41.729
 all dressed and as some demo 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:42.479
 have done yes then we are done with 

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:43.710
 the mission 

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:45.450
 so as you can see we have 12 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:46.890
 backs needed i have nobody jar effect 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:49.380
 then you can but is see them 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:51.780
 there are already 17 in the entire folder or something 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:53.159
 at least we cannot entirely for that 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:54.390
 well assume there are seventeen but the 

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:55.560
 then lie in the case enough and then 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:58.700
 you just have to get them back 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:58.700
 I think yes 

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:03.240
 ok well now the idea is that we have this box 

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:06.329
 what they place 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:08.580
 you way you salt up we lay that 

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:10.289
 if the good man laid another one down 

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:11.610
 icm expensive so now have the first two 

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:13.440
 minutes 

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:15.360

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:16.709
 had so many settings just because it is possible 

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:18.420
 and what we are going to do now is try now 

00:02:16.709 --> 00:02:19.830
 both xylem to move all the best 

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:21.150
 you break that chaos with everything 

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:21.959
 where you here in need what fast 

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:23.700

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:32.430
 meanwhile wants my weapon 

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:34.440
 just for good measure 

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:36.120
 because why not artifacts as one 

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:37.920

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:11.100
 this icm th 

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:14.010

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:15.840
 before I have to put down my icm 

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:17.730

00:03:23.519 --> 00:03:26.220
 seconds left 

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:28.049
 as we move as quickly as possible fashion 

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:29.430

00:03:28.049 --> 00:03:33.870
