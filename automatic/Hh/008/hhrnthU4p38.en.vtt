curve so we're going to take this and
we're<00:00:45.210> going<00:00:45.450> to<00:00:45.539> use<00:00:45.629> that<00:00:45.660> principal<00:00:46.170> you

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 
we're going to use that principal you

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:50.660 
we're going to use that principal you
know<00:00:47.100> magic<00:00:47.520> and<00:00:48.920> we're<00:00:49.920> going<00:00:50.070> to<00:00:50.100> use<00:00:50.370> it<00:00:50.640> and

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670 
know magic and we're going to use it and

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:54.100 
know magic and we're going to use it and
make<00:00:51.090> a<00:00:51.120> battery<00:00:51.960> we<00:00:52.079> wrap<00:00:52.289> our<00:00:52.469> radio<00:00:52.949> with<00:00:53.160> it

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:54.110 
make a battery we wrap our radio with it

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:56.479 
make a battery we wrap our radio with it
it's<00:00:55.110> easier<00:00:55.440> to<00:00:55.620> make<00:00:55.739> a<00:00:55.770> light<00:00:56.039> but<00:00:56.280> half

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
it's easier to make a light but half

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:58.340 
it's easier to make a light but half
full<00:00:56.760> I<00:00:57.000> don't<00:00:57.239> know<00:00:57.329> you<00:00:57.719> could<00:00:57.899> do<00:00:58.320> something

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
full I don't know you could do something

00:00:58.350 --> 00:00:59.990 
full I don't know you could do something
with<00:00:58.680> it<00:00:58.829> but<00:00:59.070> I'm<00:00:59.250> gonna<00:00:59.399> make<00:00:59.489> a<00:00:59.520> Syria<00:00:59.940> to

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
with it but I'm gonna make a Syria to

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.789 
with it but I'm gonna make a Syria to
make<00:01:00.180> a<00:01:00.210> series<00:01:00.660> of<00:01:00.690> cells<00:01:01.879> what<00:01:02.879> self<00:01:03.559> and<00:01:04.559> do

that I take em I might use some for

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:11.630 
that I take em I might use some for
aluminum<00:01:09.110> and<00:01:10.110> the<00:01:10.350> copper<00:01:10.770> now<00:01:11.100> for<00:01:11.310> copper<00:01:11.610> I

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
aluminum and the copper now for copper I

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:13.490 
aluminum and the copper now for copper I
just<00:01:11.909> ripped<00:01:12.119> open<00:01:12.270> a<00:01:12.510> coax<00:01:12.900> cable<00:01:13.049> because

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500 
just ripped open a coax cable because

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:15.230 
just ripped open a coax cable because
everybody<00:01:13.950> should<00:01:14.100> have<00:01:14.130> a<00:01:14.280> coax<00:01:14.670> cable<00:01:14.790> I

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
everybody should have a coax cable I

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:17.570 
everybody should have a coax cable I
didn't<00:01:16.080> bother<00:01:16.200> stripping<00:01:16.799> out<00:01:16.920> there<00:01:17.189> the

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
didn't bother stripping out there the

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:19.789 
didn't bother stripping out there the
center<00:01:17.880> connector<00:01:18.330> anything<00:01:18.720> I'm<00:01:19.470> just<00:01:19.650> going

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799 
center connector anything I'm just going

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:21.289 
center connector anything I'm just going
to<00:01:19.830> cut<00:01:20.040> this<00:01:20.189> down<00:01:20.400> and<00:01:20.729> put<00:01:20.880> it<00:01:20.970> in<00:01:21.060> pill

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:21.299 
to cut this down and put it in pill

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:24.200 
to cut this down and put it in pill
bottles<00:01:21.740> and<00:01:22.740> make<00:01:23.040> my<00:01:23.220> cells<00:01:23.520> and<00:01:23.850> jump<00:01:24.119> it

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210 
bottles and make my cells and jump it

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:27.200 
bottles and make my cells and jump it
together<00:01:24.479> in<00:01:24.720> series<00:01:25.610> and<00:01:26.610> i'll<00:01:26.790> multiply<00:01:27.000> the

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210 
together in series and i'll multiply the

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:28.819 
together in series and i'll multiply the
voltage<00:01:27.600> so<00:01:27.780> we<00:01:27.869> get<00:01:27.990> about<00:01:28.080> 3<00:01:28.350> volts<00:01:28.650> because

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:28.829 
voltage so we get about 3 volts because

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:30.740 
voltage so we get about 3 volts because
the<00:01:29.520> radio<00:01:29.820> we<00:01:29.909> have<00:01:29.939> the<00:01:30.180> other<00:01:30.329> day<00:01:30.479> worked

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:30.750 
the radio we have the other day worked

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:32.890 
the radio we have the other day worked
on<00:01:30.990> 3<00:01:31.290> volts<00:01:31.619> so<00:01:31.829> we're<00:01:32.009> going<00:01:32.100> to<00:01:32.189> do<00:01:32.340> that<00:01:32.549> one

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:32.900 
on 3 volts so we're going to do that one

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:35.510 
on 3 volts so we're going to do that one
so<00:01:33.900> we'd<00:01:34.049> be<00:01:34.170> able<00:01:34.229> to<00:01:34.409> get<00:01:34.500> our<00:01:34.619> short<00:01:34.979> wave<00:01:35.159> or

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:35.520 
so we'd be able to get our short wave or

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:38.410 
so we'd be able to get our short wave or
whatever<00:01:36.000> if<00:01:36.390> we<00:01:36.600> need<00:01:36.750> to<00:01:36.930> an<00:01:37.049> emergency

00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:38.420 
whatever if we need to an emergency

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:42.289 
whatever if we need to an emergency
again<00:01:40.280> you<00:01:41.280> could<00:01:41.430> you<00:01:41.759> take<00:01:41.970> a<00:01:42.030> regular

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:42.299 
again you could you take a regular

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:44.359 
again you could you take a regular
battery<00:01:42.810> and<00:01:42.960> strip<00:01:43.200> the<00:01:43.320> casing<00:01:43.710> off<00:01:43.890> it<00:01:44.100> and

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369 
battery and strip the casing off it and

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:46.940 
battery and strip the casing off it and
break<00:01:44.880> out<00:01:45.060> a<00:01:45.090> little<00:01:45.299> black<00:01:45.630> stuff<00:01:45.990> the<00:01:46.320> acid

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:46.950 
break out a little black stuff the acid

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:50.090 
break out a little black stuff the acid

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:55.580 
corn take a little ride on the middle do
it<00:01:51.860> but<00:01:52.860> this<00:01:53.040> is<00:01:53.189> how<00:01:53.280> you<00:01:53.340> do<00:01:53.579> this<00:01:54.560> it<00:01:55.560> will

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:59.600 
it but this is how you do this it will
strip<00:01:56.250> some<00:01:56.610> of<00:01:56.670> the<00:01:56.820> plating<00:01:57.600> up<00:01:58.340> 1110<00:01:59.340> them

start<00:02:08.129> taking<00:02:08.520> it<00:02:08.550> now<00:02:08.729> coppers<00:02:09.660> more<00:02:10.050> I<00:02:10.349> on

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:10.860 
start taking it now coppers more I on

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:13.520 
start taking it now coppers more I on

in<00:02:13.650> this<00:02:13.830> case<00:02:14.100> is<00:02:14.430> um<00:02:15.140> yellow<00:02:16.140> zinc<00:02:16.440> still

00:02:17.059 --> 00:02:17.069 
in this case is um yellow zinc still

00:02:17.069 --> 00:02:19.760 
in this case is um yellow zinc still
still<00:02:17.459> work<00:02:17.930> you<00:02:18.930> see<00:02:19.110> the<00:02:19.230> yellowing<00:02:19.650> is

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:19.770 
still work you see the yellowing is

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:23.300 
still work you see the yellowing is
being<00:02:19.980> stripped<00:02:20.340> off<00:02:20.520> there<00:02:20.880> and<00:02:21.830> those<00:02:22.830> ions

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:23.310 
being stripped off there and those ions

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:25.880 
being stripped off there and those ions
are<00:02:23.459> flowing<00:02:23.760> over<00:02:23.910> to<00:02:24.180> there<00:02:24.870> through<00:02:25.200> the<00:02:25.230> to

the pink thing through the acid in this

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:32.540 
the pink thing through the acid in this
case<00:02:29.819> in<00:02:30.630> this<00:02:30.720> case<00:02:30.930> for<00:02:31.140> using<00:02:31.380> vinegar<00:02:31.560> was

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:32.550 
case in this case for using vinegar was

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:34.250 
case in this case for using vinegar was
a<00:02:32.580> little<00:02:32.910> bit<00:02:33.030> of<00:02:33.120> salt<00:02:33.300> I<00:02:33.600> found<00:02:33.900> the<00:02:34.020> salt

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:34.260 
a little bit of salt I found the salt

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:36.260 
a little bit of salt I found the salt
and<00:02:34.410> making<00:02:34.770> a<00:02:34.830> difference<00:02:35.190> as<00:02:35.910> far<00:02:36.000> as

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:36.270 
and making a difference as far as

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:37.520 
and making a difference as far as
voltage<00:02:36.540> I<00:02:36.630> thought<00:02:36.780> I<00:02:36.810> might<00:02:36.900> kick<00:02:37.170> it<00:02:37.290> up<00:02:37.380> and

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:37.530 
voltage I thought I might kick it up and

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:39.740 
voltage I thought I might kick it up and
it<00:02:37.620> didn't<00:02:37.860> so<00:02:38.760> let<00:02:39.030> me<00:02:39.090> go<00:02:39.270> ahead<00:02:39.300> and<00:02:39.480> build

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:39.750 
it didn't so let me go ahead and build

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:41.630 
it didn't so let me go ahead and build
this<00:02:39.870> battery<00:02:40.290> let's<00:02:41.100> see<00:02:41.280> if<00:02:41.370> we<00:02:41.489> can

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:41.640 
this battery let's see if we can

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:43.760 
this battery let's see if we can
actually<00:02:41.730> get<00:02:42.000> a<00:02:42.060> regular<00:02:42.480> room<00:02:42.690> or<00:02:43.470> in<00:02:43.650> need

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:43.770 
actually get a regular room or in need

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:48.710 
actually get a regular room or in need
three<00:02:44.069> bolts<00:02:45.170> so<00:02:47.150> we'll<00:02:48.150> see<00:02:48.390> how<00:02:48.420> that<00:02:48.540> goes

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:48.720 
three bolts so we'll see how that goes

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:50.630 
three bolts so we'll see how that goes
I'm<00:02:49.200> going<00:02:49.320> to<00:02:49.440> just<00:02:49.739> like<00:02:49.950> them<00:02:50.160> to<00:02:50.370> put<00:02:50.519> the

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:50.640 
I'm going to just like them to put the

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:53.990 
I'm going to just like them to put the
copper<00:02:50.970> wire<00:02:51.150> in<00:02:51.360> the<00:02:51.650> pill<00:02:52.650> bottles<00:02:52.980> and<00:02:53.190> the

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:54.000 
copper wire in the pill bottles and the

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:55.460 
copper wire in the pill bottles and the
only<00:02:54.120> reason<00:02:54.209> I'm<00:02:54.450> using<00:02:54.510> pill<00:02:54.900> bottles<00:02:55.290> is

00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:55.470 
only reason I'm using pill bottles is

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:56.870 
only reason I'm using pill bottles is
because<00:02:55.890> I<00:02:56.010> don't<00:02:56.190> want<00:02:56.220> to<00:02:56.370> use<00:02:56.489> up<00:02:56.519> all<00:02:56.730> the

00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:56.880 
because I don't want to use up all the

00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:58.280 
because I don't want to use up all the
vinegar<00:02:57.180> in<00:02:57.239> the<00:02:57.300> house<00:02:57.450> or<00:02:57.720> the<00:02:57.750> wife<00:02:58.080> will

00:02:58.280 --> 00:02:58.290 
vinegar in the house or the wife will

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:02.690 
vinegar in the house or the wife will
beat<00:02:58.530> me<00:02:58.970> so<00:02:59.970> we<00:03:00.690> use<00:03:00.840> two<00:03:01.080> bottles<00:03:01.500> and<00:03:01.739> I'll

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:02.700 
beat me so we use two bottles and I'll

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:04.009 
beat me so we use two bottles and I'll
just<00:03:02.850> clip<00:03:03.090> it<00:03:03.209> together<00:03:03.480> and<00:03:03.720> we'll<00:03:03.870> get

00:03:04.009 --> 00:03:04.019 
just clip it together and we'll get

00:03:04.019 --> 00:03:05.900 
just clip it together and we'll get
going<00:03:04.080> so<00:03:04.500> let<00:03:05.130> me<00:03:05.250> get<00:03:05.340> this<00:03:05.370> thing<00:03:05.640> set<00:03:05.880> up

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:05.910 
going so let me get this thing set up

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:09.860 
going so let me get this thing set up
and<00:03:06.120> I'll<00:03:06.269> be<00:03:06.360> right<00:03:06.480> back<00:03:06.600> okay<00:03:08.000> okay<00:03:09.000> so<00:03:09.630> what

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:09.870 
and I'll be right back okay okay so what

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:12.830 
and I'll be right back okay okay so what
about<00:03:09.989> three<00:03:10.350> bolts<00:03:10.819> 2.99<00:03:11.819> three<00:03:12.540> volts

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:12.840 
about three bolts 2.99 three volts

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:16.840 
about three bolts 2.99 three volts
whatever<00:03:13.310> so<00:03:14.310> let<00:03:14.430> me<00:03:14.519> pull<00:03:14.790> this<00:03:14.910> out<00:03:15.120> on<00:03:15.330> you

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:16.850 
whatever so let me pull this out on you

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:22.069 
whatever so let me pull this out on you
and<00:03:19.640> we've<00:03:20.640> got<00:03:20.790> four<00:03:21.030> cells<00:03:21.329> at<00:03:21.600> four<00:03:21.900> wet

00:03:22.069 --> 00:03:22.079 
and we've got four cells at four wet

00:03:22.079 --> 00:03:26.449 
and we've got four cells at four wet
cells<00:03:22.380> that<00:03:23.190> equal<00:03:23.579> will<00:03:23.970> revolt<00:03:24.890> and<00:03:25.890> then<00:03:26.400> I

00:03:26.449 --> 00:03:26.459 
cells that equal will revolt and then I

00:03:26.459 --> 00:03:28.520 
cells that equal will revolt and then I
got<00:03:26.640> a<00:03:26.700> little<00:03:26.940> one<00:03:27.299> bolt<00:03:27.570> buzzer<00:03:27.840> here<00:03:28.200> or<00:03:28.380> to

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:28.530 
got a little one bolt buzzer here or to

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:34.840 
got a little one bolt buzzer here or to
bolt<00:03:28.739> buzzer<00:03:28.950> I<00:03:29.220> guess<00:03:30.049> it<00:03:31.049> barely<00:03:31.230> comes<00:03:31.500> on

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:34.850 

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:40.030 

so<00:03:35.850> there's<00:03:36.810> that

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:40.040 

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:44.780 

quite<00:03:41.040> have<00:03:41.220> the<00:03:41.250> amperage<00:03:43.160> but<00:03:44.160> let<00:03:44.550> me<00:03:44.580> go

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:44.790 
quite have the amperage but let me go

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:46.220 
quite have the amperage but let me go
ahead<00:03:44.880> and<00:03:45.000> hook<00:03:45.150> the<00:03:45.330> radio<00:03:45.630> up<00:03:45.660> an<00:03:45.960> order<00:03:46.170> of

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:46.230 
ahead and hook the radio up an order of

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:53.950 
ahead and hook the radio up an order of
that<00:03:50.540> okay<00:03:51.540> I've<00:03:52.530> tuned<00:03:52.890> it<00:03:53.040> to<00:03:53.160> a<00:03:53.220> static

00:03:53.950 --> 00:03:53.960 
that okay I've tuned it to a static

00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:56.150 
that okay I've tuned it to a static
because<00:03:54.960> the<00:03:55.050> copyright<00:03:55.530> stuff<00:03:55.830> I<00:03:56.010> don't<00:03:56.070> want

00:03:56.150 --> 00:03:56.160 
because the copyright stuff I don't want

00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:59.330 
because the copyright stuff I don't want
to<00:03:56.310> violating<00:03:56.640> copyright<00:03:57.350> but<00:03:58.350> as<00:03:58.860> you<00:03:59.100> see

00:03:59.330 --> 00:03:59.340 
to violating copyright but as you see

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:01.250 
to violating copyright but as you see
it's<00:03:59.460> working<00:03:59.610> if<00:03:59.940> I<00:04:00.030> lift<00:04:00.330> Eirik<00:04:00.810> anybody's

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:01.260 
it's working if I lift Eirik anybody's

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:17.050 
it's working if I lift Eirik anybody's
content<00:04:02.240> it<00:04:03.240> dies<00:04:07.970> as<00:04:08.970> you<00:04:09.270> see<00:04:09.740> it<00:04:10.740> does<00:04:11.010> work

00:04:17.050 --> 00:04:17.060 

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:24.230

I<00:04:55.830> thought<00:04:56.340> I'd<00:04:56.460> do<00:04:56.580> this<00:04:57.110> so<00:04:58.110> here<00:04:58.680> we<00:04:58.770> go

00:04:58.820 --> 00:04:58.830 
I thought I'd do this so here we go

00:04:58.830 --> 00:05:04.070 
I thought I'd do this so here we go
here's<00:04:59.730> the<00:04:59.970> um<00:05:01.430> okay<00:05:02.430> whatever<00:05:02.730> okay<00:05:03.240> here's

00:05:07.250 --> 00:05:07.260 
the the board for that I got the trash

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:09.770 
the the board for that I got the trash
earlier<00:05:07.650> nice<00:05:08.460> made<00:05:08.700> despot<00:05:09.090> separators<00:05:09.630> in

00:05:09.770 --> 00:05:09.780 
earlier nice made despot separators in

the<00:05:09.840> battery<00:05:10.200> they<00:05:10.860> aren't<00:05:11.040> really<00:05:11.250> necessary

00:05:11.420 --> 00:05:11.430 
the battery they aren't really necessary

00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:13.220 
the battery they aren't really necessary
it's<00:05:12.090> just<00:05:12.330> I'm<00:05:12.450> using<00:05:12.690> such<00:05:12.930> small

00:05:13.220 --> 00:05:13.230 
it's just I'm using such small

00:05:13.230 --> 00:05:14.810 
it's just I'm using such small
containers<00:05:13.770> I<00:05:13.920> know<00:05:13.980> what<00:05:14.190> the<00:05:14.310> metal<00:05:14.550> touch

00:05:14.810 --> 00:05:14.820 
containers I know what the metal touch

00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:16.970 
containers I know what the metal touch
of<00:05:15.000> ground<00:05:15.210> out<00:05:15.450> could<00:05:16.170> I<00:05:16.230> lose<00:05:16.410> the<00:05:16.590> batter<00:05:16.770> to

00:05:16.970 --> 00:05:16.980 
of ground out could I lose the batter to

00:05:16.980 --> 00:05:20.570 
of ground out could I lose the batter to
ground<00:05:17.220> out<00:05:17.460> so<00:05:18.620> there<00:05:19.620> you<00:05:19.740> go<00:05:19.800> you<00:05:20.370> get

00:05:20.570 --> 00:05:20.580 
ground out so there you go you get

00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:23.600 
ground out so there you go you get
information<00:05:21.150> an<00:05:21.270> emergency<00:05:21.870> or<00:05:22.560> whatever<00:05:23.280> I

00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:23.610 
information an emergency or whatever I

00:05:23.610 --> 00:05:27.950 
information an emergency or whatever I
think<00:05:24.330> that<00:05:24.480> you<00:05:24.600> can<00:05:24.750> use<00:05:24.900> P<00:05:25.190> so<00:05:26.190> I<00:05:26.780> guess<00:05:27.780> the

00:05:27.950 --> 00:05:27.960 
think that you can use P so I guess the

00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:29.720 
think that you can use P so I guess the
more<00:05:28.140> on<00:05:28.380> or<00:05:28.560> the<00:05:28.830> person<00:05:29.250> the<00:05:29.340> better<00:05:29.520> the

00:05:29.720 --> 00:05:29.730 
more on or the person the better the

00:05:29.730 --> 00:05:31.940 
more on or the person the better the
conductor<00:05:30.330> but<00:05:30.510> still<00:05:30.810> you<00:05:31.530> know<00:05:31.620> he's<00:05:31.770> kind

00:05:31.940 --> 00:05:31.950 
conductor but still you know he's kind

00:05:31.950 --> 00:05:33.920 
conductor but still you know he's kind
of<00:05:32.280> acidic<00:05:32.760> it's<00:05:33.210> all<00:05:33.390> these<00:05:33.630> that<00:05:33.810> you're

00:05:33.920 --> 00:05:33.930 
of acidic it's all these that you're

00:05:33.930 --> 00:05:36.020 
of acidic it's all these that you're
good<00:05:34.050> to<00:05:34.140> go<00:05:34.170> now<00:05:35.160> this<00:05:35.250> gives<00:05:35.490> vinegar<00:05:35.910> and

00:05:36.020 --> 00:05:36.030 
good to go now this gives vinegar and

00:05:36.030 --> 00:05:38.510 
good to go now this gives vinegar and
there's<00:05:36.180> some<00:05:36.480> some<00:05:37.260> salt<00:05:37.590> dissolved<00:05:38.190> in<00:05:38.310> this

00:05:38.510 --> 00:05:38.520 
there's some some salt dissolved in this

00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:43.310 
there's some some salt dissolved in this
but<00:05:38.910> not<00:05:39.570> a<00:05:39.600> lot<00:05:39.690> um<00:05:40.670> I<00:05:41.670> mean<00:05:42.600> I<00:05:42.660> kind<00:05:42.960> of<00:05:43.110> it'll

00:05:43.310 --> 00:05:43.320 
but not a lot um I mean I kind of it'll

00:05:43.320 --> 00:05:44.360 
but not a lot um I mean I kind of it'll
make<00:05:43.470> a<00:05:43.560> difference<00:05:43.770> by<00:05:44.010> season<00:05:44.250> one

00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:44.370

00:06:23.310 --> 00:06:23.320 
but I said you can use aluminum one I

but I said you can use aluminum one I
found<00:06:24.320> that<00:06:24.560> zinc<00:06:24.980> was<00:06:25.160> more<00:06:25.370> reactive<00:06:25.940> now<00:06:26.780> if

00:06:27.160 --> 00:06:27.170 
found that zinc was more reactive now if

00:06:27.170 --> 00:06:28.990 
found that zinc was more reactive now if
I<00:06:27.320> were<00:06:27.380> to<00:06:27.470> use<00:06:27.620> hydrogen<00:06:27.860> peroxide<00:06:28.070> maybe<00:06:28.760> I

00:06:28.990 --> 00:06:29.000 
I were to use hydrogen peroxide maybe I

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:32.080 
I were to use hydrogen peroxide maybe I
would<00:06:29.240> do<00:06:29.360> that<00:06:29.390> and<00:06:29.750> be<00:06:29.810> better<00:06:30.050> but<00:06:30.350> still<00:06:31.090> so

00:06:32.080 --> 00:06:32.090 
would do that and be better but still so

00:06:32.090 --> 00:06:34.780 
would do that and be better but still so
there's<00:06:32.540> a<00:06:32.630> 3<00:06:32.840> volt<00:06:33.050> battery<00:06:33.380> made<00:06:33.560> up<00:06:33.770> and<00:06:34.010> you

00:06:34.780 --> 00:06:34.790 
there's a 3 volt battery made up and you

00:06:34.790 --> 00:06:36.520 
there's a 3 volt battery made up and you
know<00:06:34.880> can<00:06:35.060> still<00:06:35.360> everywhere<00:06:35.720> so<00:06:35.960> be<00:06:36.140> careful

00:06:36.520 --> 00:06:36.530 
know can still everywhere so be careful

00:06:36.530 --> 00:06:39.250 
know can still everywhere so be careful
think<00:06:36.950> about<00:06:37.100> it<00:06:37.360> if<00:06:38.360> you<00:06:38.600> bleach<00:06:39.020> you

00:06:39.250 --> 00:06:39.260 
think about it if you bleach you

00:06:39.260 --> 00:06:40.780 
think about it if you bleach you
probably<00:06:39.560> a<00:06:39.650> little<00:06:39.800> more<00:06:39.950> amp<00:06:40.190> hours<00:06:40.550> out<00:06:40.760> of

00:06:40.780 --> 00:06:40.790 
probably a little more amp hours out of

probably a little more amp hours out of
it<00:06:41.030> I<00:06:41.270> don't<00:06:41.810> know<00:06:41.870> how<00:06:42.050> long<00:06:42.200> it'll<00:06:42.410> run<00:06:42.770> but

00:06:43.290 --> 00:06:43.300 
it I don't know how long it'll run but

00:06:43.300 --> 00:06:45.880 
it I don't know how long it'll run but
I've<00:06:44.300> had<00:06:44.480> it<00:06:44.600> ready<00:06:44.750> for<00:06:45.020> about<00:06:45.140> 15<00:06:45.650> minutes
