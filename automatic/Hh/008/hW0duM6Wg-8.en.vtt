00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:11.900 
class in a large pot I'm using 500 rims

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:14.020

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:20.960 
now make sure you put the rock salt of

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:23.110 
now make sure you put the rock salt of
the<00:02:20.990> sea<00:02:21.170> salt<00:02:21.440> when<00:02:21.740> they<00:02:22.310> actually<00:02:22.550> water

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:23.120 
the sea salt when they actually water

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:25.180 
the sea salt when they actually water
boils<00:02:23.660> not<00:02:23.960> before<00:02:24.290> that<00:02:24.440> and<00:02:24.650> don't<00:02:24.890> put<00:02:25.010> any

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:25.190 
boils not before that and don't put any

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:26.740 
boils not before that and don't put any
oil<00:02:25.220> cuz<00:02:25.730> they<00:02:25.820> all<00:02:25.970> will<00:02:26.150> it<00:02:26.330> doesn't<00:02:26.630> help

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:26.750 
oil cuz they all will it doesn't help

I'll actually want to make this al dente

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:38.290 
I'll actually want to make this al dente
and<00:02:36.110> we<00:02:36.530> could<00:02:36.710> get<00:02:36.830> 4x<00:02:36.980> at<00:02:37.220> exactly<00:02:37.850> 10

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:38.300 
and we could get 4x at exactly 10

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:40.150 
and we could get 4x at exactly 10
minutes<00:02:38.330> from<00:02:38.990> when<00:02:39.260> the<00:02:39.410> water<00:02:39.590> boil
