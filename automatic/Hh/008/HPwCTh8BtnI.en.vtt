sacked instantly now you can see yes the

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:26.000 
sacked instantly now you can see yes the
flat<00:01:23.790> was<00:01:24.000> open<00:01:24.390> but<00:01:24.810> we<00:01:24.990> weren't<00:01:25.290> ready<00:01:25.740> we

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:26.010 
flat was open but we weren't ready we

00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:27.980 
flat was open but we weren't ready we
weren't<00:01:26.280> ready<00:01:26.400> for<00:01:26.520> that<00:01:26.670> pressure<00:01:27.000> we<00:01:27.810> could

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990 
weren't ready for that pressure we could

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:29.000 
weren't ready for that pressure we could
use<00:01:28.110> slab<00:01:28.320> protection<00:01:28.710> but<00:01:28.830> what<00:01:28.920> would

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:29.010 
use slab protection but what would

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:30.530 
use slab protection but what would
happen<00:01:29.159> is<00:01:29.400> that<00:01:29.430> weak<00:01:29.729> side<00:01:29.940> pressure<00:01:30.240> would

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.540 
happen is that weak side pressure would

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:32.780 
happen is that weak side pressure would
come<00:01:30.780> in<00:01:30.930> off<00:01:31.049> that<00:01:31.080> left<00:01:31.590> edge<00:01:31.860> so<00:01:32.159> we<00:01:32.580> need<00:01:32.700> to

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:32.790 
come in off that left edge so we need to

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:34.310 
come in off that left edge so we need to
be<00:01:32.970> able<00:01:33.060> to<00:01:33.180> single<00:01:33.540> out<00:01:33.630> our<00:01:33.900> pass

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320 
be able to single out our pass

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:35.930 
be able to single out our pass
protection<00:01:34.560> scheme<00:01:35.070> here<00:01:35.340> and<00:01:35.549> take<00:01:35.729> a<00:01:35.760> look

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:35.940 
protection scheme here and take a look

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:37.700 
protection scheme here and take a look
at<00:01:36.090> our<00:01:36.210> offense<00:01:36.840> and<00:01:36.930> see<00:01:37.110> who<00:01:37.260> can<00:01:37.409> we<00:01:37.500> block

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710 
at our offense and see who can we block

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:39.590 
at our offense and see who can we block
so<00:01:38.040> for<00:01:38.640> facing<00:01:38.970> pressure<00:01:39.180> off<00:01:39.330> the<00:01:39.450> right

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:39.600 
so for facing pressure off the right

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:41.000 
so for facing pressure off the right
edge<00:01:39.630> we<00:01:39.960> can<00:01:40.080> have<00:01:40.170> two<00:01:40.290> ops<00:01:40.470> you<00:01:40.650> can<00:01:40.830> block

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:41.010 
edge we can have two ops you can block

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:42.680 
edge we can have two ops you can block
our<00:01:41.190> halfback<00:01:41.610> or<00:01:41.850> you<00:01:41.940> can<00:01:42.060> block<00:01:42.270> our<00:01:42.479> tight

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:42.690 
our halfback or you can block our tight

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:43.730 
our halfback or you can block our tight
end<00:01:42.720> now

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 
end now

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:45.770 
end now
most<00:01:44.100> cases<00:01:44.400> I<00:01:44.640> like<00:01:44.820> to<00:01:44.909> say<00:01:45.060> block<00:01:45.420> the<00:01:45.600> tight

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
most cases I like to say block the tight

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:47.510 
most cases I like to say block the tight
at<00:01:45.930> first<00:01:45.990> as<00:01:46.350> you'll<00:01:46.500> see<00:01:46.680> our<00:01:47.190> tight<00:01:47.490> end

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
at first as you'll see our tight end

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:48.920 
at first as you'll see our tight end
Corliss<00:01:48.030> is<00:01:48.150> on<00:01:48.240> the<00:01:48.299> line<00:01:48.450> of<00:01:48.540> scrimmage<00:01:48.570> that
