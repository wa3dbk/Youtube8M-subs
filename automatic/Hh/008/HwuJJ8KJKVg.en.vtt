00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:13.740
 how many guys are we ahead of 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:15.269
 I would have the war under the description 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:16.410
 I was already seeing myself put it 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:18.210
 from time to time you have already done me for 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:19.500

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:25.199
 guys this looks very good 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:26.670
 I think it's a standard career but 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:29.099
 I should have put it without contact 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:31.439
 which is how it came because I've seen 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:33.809
 well it's called the race is excess of 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:35.700
 precision or something like that and it does not look like 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:37.469
 be for nothing easy so nothing guys 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:39.690
 well I've been out a couple of days 

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:41.489

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:43.530
 you have had sent a video that I did not upload 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:44.820
 last night in mega ultra hyper hype 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:46.230
 age or if you want to see it then it is 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:47.879
 put on the channel and I'll leave it because 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:49.050
 under the description also so nothing 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:50.760
 we are playing with a lot of 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:51.899
 subscribers we are also playing with 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:53.789
 a friend of mine called sickle and hammer 

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:55.469
 that if you want to add it well 

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:57.300
 travel through it so you can see it sickle and 

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:59.039
 hammer if you want to add it to the play 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:01.350
 and bring trolling a little bit you can 

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:02.609
 do it because he's a friend of mine and I want to 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:03.960
 that the other laws in plan so cool 

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:05.909
 It's worth it so guys there you have it for 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:07.499
 whoever wants any 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:09.780
 nothing you can not say anything because if not 

00:01:07.499 --> 00:01:11.159
 it exists whole no longer has grace so 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:13.979
 nothing guys we continue with the little race 

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:17.100
 that the truth because at the moment it does not have 

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:18.179
 a lot of complication and at the moment I do not have 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:20.520
 I many people in plan that I am 

00:01:18.179 --> 00:01:22.770

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:24.509

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:26.819
 happens sometimes so guys for now 

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:28.799
 everything is too soft too well 

00:01:26.819 --> 00:01:31.560

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:35.490
 problem I hope there is nothing plan 

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:37.349
 complicated, it's worth it, I just saw it 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:39.420

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:55.150
 analysis or anything because my channel is not 

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:56.860
 very dedicated to the heat of using although 

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:59.349

00:02:56.860 --> 00:03:00.370
 de jose are the professionals worth so 

00:02:59.349 --> 00:03:01.900

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:12.069
 I have to have flow pending 

00:03:10.299 --> 00:03:13.870
 those that since what I have the let's say 

00:03:12.069 --> 00:03:16.540
 that what is necessary already so that everything 

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:18.489
 work fine and correct but but you 

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:19.750
 I want to overtake nothing but I want 

00:03:18.489 --> 00:03:21.910
 to be lost the race but it is that 

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:24.519

 I would advance controls agreed to I continue 

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:38.170
 taking second but that was half 

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:40.720
 played 

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:44.650
 I think I'll wait for them to come and it's 

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:46.360
 I do not know if it was gta I would wait but 

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:47.530
 with reason would be expected with a grenade 

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:49.690
 or something like that I want to wait because 

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:51.790
