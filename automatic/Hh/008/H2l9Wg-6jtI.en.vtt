00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:53.930 
on the game and it really is it doesn't

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:56.050 
on the game and it really is it doesn't
seem<00:03:54.049> like<00:03:54.109> it's<00:03:54.470> that<00:03:54.650> long<00:03:54.950> I<00:03:55.370> think<00:03:55.909> there's

00:03:56.050 --> 00:03:56.060 
seem like it's that long I think there's

00:03:56.060 --> 00:03:58.000 
seem like it's that long I think there's
like<00:03:56.120> eight<00:03:56.480> parts<00:03:56.870> to<00:03:57.049> the<00:03:57.139> campaign<00:03:57.620> and

00:03:58.000 --> 00:03:58.010 
like eight parts to the campaign and

00:03:58.010 --> 00:03:59.979 
like eight parts to the campaign and
right<00:03:58.579> now<00:03:58.819> like<00:03:59.180> I<00:03:59.299> was<00:03:59.419> playing<00:03:59.689> it<00:03:59.780> last

00:03:59.979 --> 00:03:59.989 
right now like I was playing it last

00:03:59.989 --> 00:04:01.390 
right now like I was playing it last
night<00:04:00.290> and<00:04:00.439> I<00:04:00.530> already<00:04:00.769> went<00:04:01.040> through<00:04:01.250> about

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:01.400 
night and I already went through about

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:03.429 
night and I already went through about
two<00:04:01.760> parts<00:04:02.209> so<00:04:02.720> you<00:04:02.780> could<00:04:02.959> probably<00:04:03.169> beat

00:04:03.429 --> 00:04:03.439 
two parts so you could probably beat

00:04:03.439 --> 00:04:05.050 
two parts so you could probably beat
this<00:04:03.590> game<00:04:03.799> in<00:04:03.859> a<00:04:04.040> few<00:04:04.250> days<00:04:04.400> but<00:04:04.760> it<00:04:04.819> is

00:04:05.050 --> 00:04:05.060
