00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:07.570
 Y 

00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:10.010
 sometimes 

00:00:07.570 --> 00:00:11.719
 Hi, girls, I hope you look good 

00:00:10.010 --> 00:00:13.070
 in this video he wants to show you what 

00:00:11.719 --> 00:00:14.900
 the hair mask that was 

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:16.820
 using during the last weeks 

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:18.170
 a week ago I bought oils 

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:21.109
 to behave like to use it 

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:22.640
 as a treatment on my hair but 

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:25.130
 unfortunately I did not like the result 

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:26.329
 so I decided to add two more things 

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:28.009
 What are I going to show you in 

00:00:26.329 --> 00:00:29.960
 this video and since I'm using this 

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:32.630
 treatment I also feel hair looks 

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:33.890
 with more healthy strength and with shine 

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:36.260
 even many of you have 

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:38.000
 let know in 14 video and that's why 

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:39.200
 I want to share it with you before 

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.300
 begin I wanted to tell you that this 

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:43.490
 mentality in the hair is super soft 

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:46.070
 is basically what it does is that you 

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:47.870
 It gives shine to hair strengthens it and 

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:49.640
 avoid frizz and then when I think that 

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:50.990
 my hair that is soft used another 

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:51.860
 different face mask with others 

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:53.120
 ingredients 

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:55.070
 so if you want that in a 

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:56.720
 future I make a video showing them 

00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:59.210
 which one is I use because it is 

00:00:56.720 --> 00:01:00.680
 very good and the hair is too much 

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:02.630
 soft but nobody is managing the 

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:04.790
 needs of each one I feel that 

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:06.259
 in these moments the best mask 

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:08.390
 for my hair is this that I'm going to 

00:01:06.259 --> 00:01:11.540
 show my hair today 

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:12.040
 had brilliance had no life and so what 

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:15.170
 I make 

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:17.300
 very much in these last weeks like this 

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:18.980
 that nothing will start I hope that what 

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:21.410
 enjoy among the things that you 

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:25.990
 they need this coconut oil vinegar 

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:28.720
 of apple honey a container for the mixture 

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:30.460
 and a meter of a spoonful first 

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:32.020
 I'm pouring two tablespoons of oil 

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:34.390
 of coconut since this is going to help 

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:36.100
 repair damaged hair and also 

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:39.650
 has properties that help you 

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:41.510
 grow strong fast and healthy 

00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:43.910
 and then I'm going to use a spoonful of honey 

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:45.290
 since it conditions the hair and 

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:47.420
 other reasons than being a long time 

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:49.850
 exposed to the sun decreases the 

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:52.840
 hair shine and honey as it helps 

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:52.840
 recover that brightness 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:02.460
 and finally one tablespoon of vinegar 

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:06.380
 apple because it's going to prevent the 

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:06.380
 hair stand up and look frizzy 

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:09.920
 now I'm going to place the container in the 

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:11.990
 microwave for about 30 seconds 

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:13.820
 approximately it may be that in your 

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:16.550
 microwave be a little bit more time 

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:18.560
 or a little less time but anyway 

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:21.730
 the important thing is that they melt well 

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:21.730
 coconut oil and honey 

00:02:23.609 --> 00:02:28.180
 this treatment is used with hair 

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:30.310
 completely dry and the first thing that I 

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:32.440
 I do before applying it is to untangle myself 

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:34.150
 hair 

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:35.980
 after that I divide the hair to the 

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:38.370
 half and subject the top part with a 

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:40.319
 Scullion 

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:42.540
 I personally like to apply it 

00:02:40.319 --> 00:02:44.459
 from a little above the middle 

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:46.440
 of the hair to the tips but if 

00:02:44.459 --> 00:02:49.580
 you wish you can apply it from 

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:49.580
 the root to the tips 

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:14.470
 love 

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:20.640
 i 

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:29.090
 when I finish with all the hair 

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:31.099
 I always focus on continuing to apply 

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:33.840
 treatment at the tips nothing more and 

00:03:31.099 --> 00:03:35.470
 Well, it's supposed to be this way 

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:37.570
 plus 

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:38.980
 then start to spin my 

00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:41.380
 hair and hold it in the part of 

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:43.570
 up with a prick 

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:45.640
 and then placed a hat this they are 

00:03:43.570 --> 00:03:47.110
 watching is designed especially for 

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:49.660
 when one takes to treatments in the 

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:51.370
 hair this treatment is 30 

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:53.230
 minutes and I always use my alarm 

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:54.640
 so I do not forget and then now 

00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:56.740
 I'm going to show you what I do next 

00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:58.870
 of the treatment the first thing I do is 

00:03:56.740 --> 00:04:01.000
 wash my hair with my favorite shampoo 

00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:03.040
 and in this case is this one of the brand network 

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:04.660
 who is called scalp wild life and is 

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:07.390
 great for people who like me 

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:09.130
 suffer from dandruff as a conditioner 

00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:11.560
 I am currently using this new 

00:04:09.130 --> 00:04:14.140
 the mark danger fructis and it's called high 

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:16.180
 dry research smells delicious and leaves the 

00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:17.919
 super soft hair 

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:19.930
 after the hair is clean 

00:04:17.919 --> 00:04:21.519
 applied this rose product is called is 

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:23.020
 woman conditioner this is a 

00:04:21.519 --> 00:04:25.300
 conditioner without rinsing that is 

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:27.669
 great to untangle the hair and 

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:29.710
 before you dry your hair 

00:04:27.669 --> 00:04:32.580
 grilled or whatever you're going to do that 

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:32.580
 have to do with heat 

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:36.650
 then I start to untangle the hair 

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:38.670
 with a brush that has the cells 

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:40.710
 separated 

00:04:38.670 --> 00:04:42.840
 then dry the hair by encimita without 

00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:45.950
 use brush or anything until it is 

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:45.950
 completely dry 

00:04:48.660 --> 00:04:52.530
 then I divide it into the remaining subject in 

00:04:50.850 --> 00:04:54.770
 the top part and start to iron 

00:04:52.530 --> 00:04:54.770
 the 

00:04:58.370 --> 00:05:01.370
 8 

00:05:10.030 --> 00:05:14.470
 this is the final result of how it looks 

00:05:12.370 --> 00:05:16.540
 the hair after the washing treatment 

00:05:14.470 --> 00:05:17.920
 and ironed and now I want to teach you 

00:05:16.540 --> 00:05:19.540
 a moment of the last two 

00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:21.820
 products that I always use later 

00:05:19.540 --> 00:05:23.950
 of this process the first is this cream 

00:05:21.820 --> 00:05:25.450
 of what is called harambee and it is very 

00:05:23.950 --> 00:05:28.500
 good because it hydrates your hair but 

00:05:25.450 --> 00:05:28.500
 it does not leave you greasy 

00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:35.220
 and finally I like to use the sun 

00:05:32.970 --> 00:05:37.729
 infusion of itself because it rebuilds and 

00:05:35.220 --> 00:05:37.729
 Brightens hair 

00:05:44.460 --> 00:05:48.210
 good until today's video I hope 

00:05:46.199 --> 00:05:49.830
 what you liked and for these girls 

00:05:48.210 --> 00:05:52.050
 who wonder how often it is used 

00:05:49.830 --> 00:05:54.180
 the mask and I used it three times 

00:05:52.050 --> 00:05:56.580
 times a month once a week and the 

00:05:54.180 --> 00:05:57.990
 fourth week of the month then he used 

00:05:56.580 --> 00:05:59.789
 the other mask I told you about 

00:05:57.990 --> 00:06:01.710
 what is it so that my hair stays 

00:05:59.789 --> 00:06:04.639
 soft and then nothing now I leave them and 

00:06:01.710 --> 00:06:04.639
 It will be until next time
