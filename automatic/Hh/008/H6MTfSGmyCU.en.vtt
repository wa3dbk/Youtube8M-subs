00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329 
headphones should isolate they should

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:06.020 
headphones should isolate they should

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170 
crazy though they may look they do a

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:11.450 
crazy though they may look they do a
good<00:01:10.350> job<00:01:10.409> of<00:01:10.590> that<00:01:10.740> it's<00:01:11.010> kind<00:01:11.159> of<00:01:11.189> like<00:01:11.340> this

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
good job of that it's kind of like this

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:14.030 
good job of that it's kind of like this
thing<00:01:11.640> here<00:01:11.850> claps<00:01:12.630> nicely<00:01:12.900> without<00:01:13.500> being

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040 
thing here claps nicely without being

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:16.039 
thing here claps nicely without being
too<00:01:14.310> tight<00:01:14.340> without<00:01:15.210> being<00:01:15.420> tight<00:01:15.720> on<00:01:15.900> your

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049 
too tight without being tight on your

head
normally<00:01:17.100> that<00:01:17.130> isolation<00:01:17.700> comes<00:01:18.119> at<00:01:18.270> the

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
normally that isolation comes at the

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:20.450 
normally that isolation comes at the
expense<00:01:18.840> of<00:01:18.960> being<00:01:19.020> tight<00:01:19.409> these<00:01:20.189> seem<00:01:20.430> to

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 
expense of being tight these seem to

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:22.100 
expense of being tight these seem to
kind<00:01:20.850> of<00:01:20.939> like<00:01:21.090> do<00:01:21.240> a<00:01:21.270> double<00:01:21.630> job<00:01:21.810> also

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
kind of like do a double job also

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:55.799 
headphones however that bass is quite

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:58.459 
headphones however that bass is quite
controlled<00:01:56.340> and<00:01:56.549> it's<00:01:56.670> quite<00:01:57.030> it's<00:01:57.899> not<00:01:58.140> muddy

00:01:58.459 --> 00:01:58.469 
controlled and it's quite it's not muddy

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:00.109 
controlled and it's quite it's not muddy
or<00:01:58.799> out<00:01:58.950> of<00:01:59.070> control<00:01:59.430> right<00:01:59.610> with<00:01:59.790> cheaper

or out of control right with cheaper

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:02.179 
or out of control right with cheaper
headphones<00:02:00.509> so<00:02:00.930> I<00:02:00.960> liked<00:02:01.320> the<00:02:01.619> bass<00:02:01.799> on<00:02:02.009> these

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:02.189 
headphones so I liked the bass on these

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:04.090 
headphones so I liked the bass on these
I<00:02:02.399> also<00:02:02.850> think<00:02:03.270> the<00:02:03.360> mid-range<00:02:03.689> was

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:04.100 
I also think the mid-range was

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:06.950 
I also think the mid-range was
accentuated<00:02:05.100> you<00:02:05.700> know<00:02:05.820> you've<00:02:06.060> got<00:02:06.180> the<00:02:06.329> the

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:06.960 
accentuated you know you've got the the

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:08.630 
accentuated you know you've got the the
sharpness<00:02:07.380> of<00:02:07.680> the<00:02:07.740> snare<00:02:08.039> drums<00:02:08.310> coming

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:08.640 
sharpness of the snare drums coming

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:12.050 
sharpness of the snare drums coming
through<00:02:08.819> on<00:02:09.000> the<00:02:09.119> mids<00:02:10.160> overall<00:02:11.160> there<00:02:11.790> they

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:12.060 
through on the mids overall there they

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:12.910 
through on the mids overall there they
sound<00:02:12.330> as<00:02:12.450> good<00:02:12.480> as

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:12.920 
sound as good as

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:14.470 
sound as good as
in<00:02:13.160> their<00:02:13.280> price<00:02:13.520> range<00:02:13.700> probably<00:02:14.120> better

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:14.480 
in their price range probably better

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:15.699 
in their price range probably better
than<00:02:14.720> stuff<00:02:14.930> higher<00:02:15.170> than<00:02:15.349> their<00:02:15.470> price<00:02:15.680> range

00:02:15.699 --> 00:02:15.709 
than stuff higher than their price range

00:02:15.709 --> 00:02:17.500 
than stuff higher than their price range
I<00:02:16.099> was<00:02:16.220> impressed<00:02:16.580> with<00:02:16.730> the<00:02:16.880> tuning<00:02:17.239> on<00:02:17.300> these

and the leaves when they plug into the
headphone<00:02:32.989> itself<00:02:33.500> if<00:02:34.069> I<00:02:34.220> can<00:02:34.400> just<00:02:34.730> get<00:02:35.600> a

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:35.660 
headphone itself if I can just get a

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:39.670 
headphone itself if I can just get a
handle<00:02:35.989> on<00:02:36.080> that<00:02:37.330> it<00:02:38.330> plugs<00:02:38.600> in<00:02:38.750> here<00:02:39.019> like<00:02:39.290> so

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:39.680 
handle on that it plugs in here like so

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:42.160 
handle on that it plugs in here like so
and<00:02:39.920> there<00:02:40.489> is<00:02:40.610> kind<00:02:41.060> of<00:02:41.090> like<00:02:41.239> a<00:02:41.269> thirty

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:42.170 
and there is kind of like a thirty

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:47.800 
and there is kind of like a thirty
degree<00:02:42.459> twist<00:02:45.610> which<00:02:46.610> now<00:02:46.819> holds<00:02:47.030> that<00:02:47.330> in

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:47.810 
degree twist which now holds that in

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:50.710 
degree twist which now holds that in
there<00:02:48.110> which<00:02:48.769> on<00:02:48.890> a<00:02:48.920> coiled<00:02:49.340> lead<00:02:49.489> is<00:02:49.670> fine<00:02:49.940> I'm

00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:50.720 
there which on a coiled lead is fine I'm

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:52.720 
there which on a coiled lead is fine I'm
not<00:02:50.930> so<00:02:51.319> I'd<00:02:51.830> be<00:02:52.040> more<00:02:52.190> careful<00:02:52.340> with<00:02:52.640> it

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:52.730 
not so I'd be more careful with it

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:54.309 
not so I'd be more careful with it
straightly<00:02:53.030> just<00:02:53.360> cuz<00:02:53.480> if<00:02:53.600> you<00:02:53.630> yank<00:02:53.959> it<00:02:54.170> you

00:02:54.309 --> 00:02:54.319 
straightly just cuz if you yank it you

00:02:54.319 --> 00:02:55.360 
straightly just cuz if you yank it you
know<00:02:54.440> you<00:02:54.500> might<00:02:54.709> damage<00:02:55.010> something<00:02:55.220> where
