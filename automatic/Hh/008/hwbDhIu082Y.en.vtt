00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.830
 hello I want to show you today how 

00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:07.440
 one very delicious blueberry muffins whole 

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:10.710
 easy to prepare at home 

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:13.380
 everything you need for it you see 

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:17.390
 already here on the picture first of all 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:21.750
 needs 440 grams of flour 110 grams of sugar 

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:24.869
 plus two packets of vanilla sugar anyway 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:29.279
 a small pinch of salt 1 tablespoon of 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:33.780
 the baking powder then still 60 milliliter 1 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:36.149
 1 60 milliliters of milk and of course 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:39.270
 Of course, not to forget 

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:41.280
 You can either be through 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:44.190
 From the glass take the vww which must 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:45.809
 but be dabbed or before that 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:47.879
 fresh no fresh has namely 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:51.539
 which from the glass but there is synonymous 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:54.739
 a very tasty muffins here again 

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:58.199
 in short all the ingredients in the survey 

00:00:54.739 --> 00:01:01.070
 so before you can go you should the 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:05.670
 Oven heated to about 200 degrees 

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:08.250
 Preheat and you can at the beginning 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:11.280
 directly form the muffin 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:13.439
 either grease or paper flags 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:15.420
 fooled that you can also briefly 

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:17.130
 make before the dough occurs as 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:18.840
 You definitely want to go 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:22.680
 But the already oven preheat times 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:24.960
 so that then the dough after real 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:26.100
 can do directly in the oven then 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:29.520
 of course it goes faster with the 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:31.560
 Banks first must now the whole 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:32.070
 of course, measured by banks 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:35.009
 become 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:35.549
 I'm starting now just a mail 

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:40.020
 on 

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:41.980
 I have such a balance here I feel 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:48.050
 now 

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:49.700
 140 grams you can of course with 

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:52.310
 measure a measuring cup 

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:54.260
 just as one does not so that mail I 

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:58.910
 I have already given it 

00:01:54.260 --> 00:02:05.870
 the bowl in then next 

00:01:58.910 --> 00:02:07.400
 a pinch of salt very little a pinch of it 

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:08.630
 here goes with very good a little one 

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:09.580
 salt spreader you can do that well too 

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:11.780
 take 

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:12.590
 Of course you can also do it with a big one 

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:16.310
 dose well 

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:21.590
 Next, I'll be the sugar 

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:30.250
 Weigh out the sugar hat 110 grams and 

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:30.250
 is now too 

00:02:48.160 --> 00:03:00.739
 a teaspoon 1 tablespoon of the baking powder 

00:02:56.650 --> 00:03:02.660
 It is easiest you can about it 

00:03:00.739 --> 00:03:05.060
 For example, estimate is the bad 

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:08.360
 something in berlin is coming now 

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:13.730
 also from the parking lot me so that in 

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:16.250
 that's enough, then we have more 

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:19.100
 sugar salt baking powder and the 

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:20.570
 Vanilla sugar in the bowl and that 

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:23.150
 we will then first of all 

00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:27.610
 Stir with the ruhr device before I 

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:27.610
 The day with a stirrer tube 

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:40.069
 if only it had to be the ingredients 

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:44.000
 next to him now comes that the 

00:03:40.069 --> 00:03:46.849
 milk to measure the milk and 

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:49.160
 of the oil I have here a measuring cup 

00:03:46.849 --> 00:03:52.489
 Called for help to make it easier 

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:56.410
 it with the car number so we need 

00:03:52.489 --> 00:04:04.629
 now 60 milliliters of milk 

00:03:56.410 --> 00:04:08.900
 that's not much and give that 

00:04:04.629 --> 00:04:11.920
 next we need 60 more 

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:11.920
 members of oil 

00:04:14.799 --> 00:04:23.240
 that also comes in here and all the 

00:04:21.350 --> 00:04:27.289
 have taken good care to know that now 

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:34.940
 only that is missing namely that I give 

00:04:27.289 --> 00:04:36.710
 now too and now everything can be done with that 

00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:40.270
 be stirred stirrer 

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:44.479
 it still lacks the heidelberg but the 

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:48.139
 They will be only after the day 

00:04:44.479 --> 00:04:49.430
 already touched and lifted the 

00:04:48.139 --> 00:04:51.530
 are not stirred but just 

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:52.820
 a little underlined presses comes 

00:04:51.530 --> 00:04:56.349
 and finally for use 

00:04:52.820 --> 00:04:56.349
 we start at the 12th 

00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:06.130
 the mine is a nice moment 

00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:12.110
 2 

00:05:12.350 --> 00:05:15.430
 go through everything 

00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:22.590
 the manroland 

00:05:23.930 --> 00:05:30.010
 until the same 

00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:30.010
 seen any twelve teams 

00:05:34.169 --> 00:05:41.310
 over wet the case is then we can 

00:05:37.499 --> 00:05:44.279
 the heidelberger so the dough is very 

00:05:41.310 --> 00:05:46.710
 so good he looks like now 

00:05:44.279 --> 00:05:49.580
 I still give the heidelberger to it 

00:05:46.710 --> 00:05:53.930
 I drained the tabs 

00:05:49.580 --> 00:05:53.930
 I just give it in here and 

00:05:56.270 --> 00:06:02.370
 then if you just with a spoon 

00:05:59.629 --> 00:06:05.759
 beautifully touched then never will 

00:06:02.370 --> 00:06:08.879
 really nice fruity for so long 

00:06:05.759 --> 00:06:10.770
 until I have everything well distributed 

00:06:08.879 --> 00:06:14.520
 The dough looks well mulled now 

00:06:10.770 --> 00:06:16.409
 and now I can do the dough in the 

00:06:14.520 --> 00:06:18.889
 give mass form because he is so ready 

00:06:16.409 --> 00:06:22.740
 of course you should either the 

00:06:18.889 --> 00:06:23.999
 bafin from still insert or what 

00:06:22.740 --> 00:06:27.389
 Of course, the easiest way is under 

00:06:23.999 --> 00:06:28.430
 tactical simply beautiful marks then 

00:06:27.389 --> 00:06:31.680
 already go in 

00:06:28.430 --> 00:06:35.270
 you can already start with that 

00:06:31.680 --> 00:06:35.270
 filling in the day 

00:06:41.050 --> 00:06:48.190
 Now you go here the dough slowly 

00:06:43.990 --> 00:06:51.669
 series and is not pacing the 

00:06:48.190 --> 00:06:55.210
 The next one is even done now 

00:06:51.669 --> 00:06:57.569
 How much to do daily, depending on 

00:06:55.210 --> 00:07:04.539
 formal one also has is the 

00:06:57.569 --> 00:07:07.210
 most valuable so the dough is ready now 

00:07:04.539 --> 00:07:08.860
 Introduced exactly for twelve muffins 

00:07:07.210 --> 00:07:11.949
 which is very convenient because that 

00:07:08.860 --> 00:07:13.650
 mostly two companies are full and the 

00:07:11.949 --> 00:07:16.690
 oven is already preheated 

00:07:13.650 --> 00:07:19.150
 That's why you can yes in the 

00:07:16.690 --> 00:07:23.580
 Give the oven for about 15 to 20 

00:07:19.150 --> 00:07:23.580
 minutes like that and off for that 

00:07:24.659 --> 00:07:31.120
 so is probably right the blue 

00:07:27.879 --> 00:07:32.530
 Berlin fans are now ready now 

00:07:31.120 --> 00:07:33.849
 they can be served 

00:07:32.530 --> 00:07:36.550
 I wish you much fun 

00:07:33.849 --> 00:07:39.389
 Bake and hope the taste 

00:07:36.550 --> 00:07:39.389
 bluebay muffins
