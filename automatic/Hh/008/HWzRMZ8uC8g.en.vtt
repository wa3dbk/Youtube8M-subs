00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:04.979
 listen to the song 

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:09.110

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:19.780
 the route of the rainbow world star 

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:23.170
 good for this level what would happen 

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:24.520
 before before because it turns out that 

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:25.870
 we need the cat skill and the 

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:27.370
 Fire skill are extremely 

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:29.770
 necessary to be able to pass until arriving 

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:31.330
 one hundred percent and as I did not know 

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:35.880
 that then 

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:35.880
 etcetera but good now yes 

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:48.220
 He is quite a father 

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:48.220
 mario galaxy from August 1 

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:56.010
 now let's assume the message here 

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:56.010
 the first star 

00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:02.330
 this part was very difficult we have to 

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:03.560
 put two balls to get our 

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:06.590
 star then let's take the one out of the 

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:08.690
 left first let's do this in 

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:11.810
 as soon as it falls we take out the red one 

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:15.280
 now we go for the next 

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:15.280
 we have to make the platform like this 

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:21.560
 as soon as it reaches the 'red' we pass to 

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:24.040
 so blue is almost perfect riva 

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:24.040
 our guitar 

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:29.920
 for himself 

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:33.120
 the 

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:35.010

00:05:11.410 --> 00:05:16.530
 Legend of Zelda and the song is hyper 

00:05:13.570 --> 00:05:16.530
 legendary 

00:05:16.930 --> 00:05:21.900

00:05:18.669 --> 00:05:21.900
