 cundinamarca the community was alerted 

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:14.719
 for an African snail outbreak that without 

00:00:12.349 --> 00:00:16.930
 some explanation appeared in the garden 

00:00:14.719 --> 00:00:20.210

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:57.329
 property and we find effectively 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:59.100
 presence of snail we perform the 

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:00.930
 pickup in bags came out 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:03.420
 about a steal of snails 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:06.030
 700 800 animals we continued 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:08.429
 incinerate them the box as authority 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:10.259
 environmental agency acted jointly with 

00:01:08.429 --> 00:01:12.539
 the other entities in the detection and 

00:01:10.259 --> 00:01:14.369
 elimination of the species as well as 

00:01:12.539 --> 00:01:16.920
 disclosure and prevention to the community 

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:19.289
 about the damage that this mollusc can 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:21.840
 produce a very meeting has been held 

00:01:19.289 --> 00:01:25.289
 important again to explain them 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:27.209
 what effects does this snail have that 

00:01:25.289 --> 00:01:29.909
 may difficulties can cause 

00:01:27.209 --> 00:01:32.670
 for health for the environment of 

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:35.280
 municipality and they started to develop 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:37.649
 communication campaigns the snail 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:39.990
 African is characterized by having a 

00:01:37.649 --> 00:01:42.720
 Length of up to 20 centimeters 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:45.420
 its creamy brown and violet tricolor what 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:47.850
 makes it unique and its shell is big long and 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:50.250
 strong reproduce fast and 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:53.039
 aggressively ruin crops 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:55.649
 It affects natural ecosystems and 

00:01:53.039 --> 00:01:58.590
 health causing serious illnesses to 

00:01:55.649 --> 00:02:01.649
 humans and consume them could 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:03.600
 be lethal it is important that you do not get caught 

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:05.369
 with the clean hand that always 

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:07.409
 use gloves of mitten or glove 

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:10.289
 plastic to avoid any 

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:13.110
 possibility and minimize the 

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:15.690
 possibility of contagion from with these 

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:17.190
 parasites the face and other authorities 

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:20.310
 health and environmental 

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:23.100
 they make a call to the community so that 

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:25.110
 avoid contact with these mollusks and 

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:27.510
 warns that if detected 

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:30.920
 they must communicate with the respective 

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:30.920
 environmental authorities
