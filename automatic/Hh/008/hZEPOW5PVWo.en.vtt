00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:09.890
 for the fans it seems useful given from

 After all, the same fun to go with planted at the bottom 

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:14.960
 squandering with pitami yes when pitt in the role 

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:17.960

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:21.380
 the sun travel such a feature spider gta wai 

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:23.119
 City has such a thing and in gta 4 probably 

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:25.280
 there is such a trick so that you could not 

00:01:23.119 --> 00:01:26.990
 I donâ€™t seem to pass by this mod 

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:28.969
 should have done and lego review so 

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:31.459

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:32.950
 g key to go in and get out 

00:01:31.459 --> 00:01:36.020

 pay nothing just food but 

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:49.450
 it is not clear where we see something 

00:01:48.069 --> 00:01:52.189
 has stopped 

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:53.810

00:01:52.189 --> 00:01:55.490
 kilometers something he didn't like he 

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:57.889
 is already getting nervous to say too 

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:59.450
 interesting to observe the reaction of grandfathers 

00:01:57.889 --> 00:02:00.880
 it's interesting to see how you see that 

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:03.380
 they will do as they drive 

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:05.620
 went to the oncoming traffic lane and just doesn't crash 

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:07.960
 I would probably be around 500 times probably 

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:09.610
