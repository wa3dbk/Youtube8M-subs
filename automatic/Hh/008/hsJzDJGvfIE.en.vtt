00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.020
 and from the side of the world in the 

00:00:01.530 --> 00:00:04.920
 northern hemisphere other expressions of the 

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:07.589
 life on earth 

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:10.380
 the popocatépetl today registered 29 

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:13.290
 exhalation is the strongest and most intense 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:15.360
 happened at 950 in the morning and generated 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:17.929
 a column of 3 kilometers on the 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:17.929
 crater level 

00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:29.050
 the popocatépetl volcano recorded a 

00:00:27.039 --> 00:00:31.439
 new explosion today at 9 50 of the 

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:31.439
 morning 

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:35.650
 in this image taken from an overflight 

00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:37.840
 that federal authorities made to 

00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:40.150
 volcano you can appreciate the crater before the 

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:42.760
 explosion a column of water vapor 

00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:44.950
 emanating from within the crater 

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:47.650
 there was a dome that was covering 

00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:49.269
 the exit of incandescent gases to 

00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:53.160
 increase the pressure the gases 

00:00:49.269 --> 00:00:53.160
 incandescents burst the dome 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:57.690
 in this other image you can see a 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:00.269
 approaching the moment of the explosion 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:02.309
 a thick column of smoke emanated from 

00:01:00.269 --> 00:01:04.739
 crater exceeding 3,000 meters 

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:06.690
 height on the left side are reached 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:08.720
 to see some rock fragments that 

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:11.490
 they were thrown 600 meters from the crater 

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:14.750
 the explosion caused the fall of ash 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:14.750
 in areas of the state of puebla 

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:18.820
 after the explosion of the libero volcano 

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:21.370
 energy so he reduced his activity 

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:22.990
 during the rest of it sends however the 

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:25.390
 possibility of re-forming the 

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:27.580
 dome to the inside of the crater keeps the 

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:30.490
 volcanic semaphore in yellow phase 3 

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:33.010
 tomorrow morning we are going to make a 

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:35.470
 overflight to observe how the 

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:37.990
 dome if it was not possible to destroy 

00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:40.600
 totally and in the afternoon today 

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:43.780
 could consolidate another sector of it 

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:46.420
 dome we may have some 

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:47.640
 eruption similar to the one we had the day 

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:49.530
 from today 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:51.630
 so far it has not been necessary 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:53.159
 perform no evacuation although the 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:55.200
 possibility of heavy rainfall in the 

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:57.270
 region could cause them to form 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:59.430
 large amounts of mud with ash 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:01.380
 emanating from the explosion with floods 

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:03.270
 in the lower parts of the municipalities of 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:05.400
 santiago xalitzintla san nicolás de los 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:07.050
 ranchos and san pedro benito juárez in the 

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:09.320
 state of puebla 

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:12.840
 the message is that the communities 

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:15.060
 near the volcano Popocatepetl 

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:16.860
 keep in communication with your 

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:18.920
 authorities and pending media 

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:21.020
 Communication 

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:23.150
 in case activity increased 

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:25.280
 of the volcano the authorities have released 

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:27.290
 the devaluation route and have the 

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:28.880
 hostels for 11,000 people per se 

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:30.500
 it was necessary to evacuate the zones of 

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:32.690
 risk of the three most municipalities 

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:34.920
 near the crater iván gonzález 

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:37.290
 television news 

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:39.780
 this is the chronicle of the day tonight 

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:42.599
 the 8 with 20 minutes was recorded this 

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:44.940
 another explosion in the crater of the volcano and 

00:02:42.599 --> 00:02:46.200
 issued this fumarole of 3 kilometers of 

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:47.580
 height 2 again on the level 

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:49.920
 december of the crater 

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:52.080
 the explosion was accompanied by emission 

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:54.360
 abundant ash and fragments 

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:56.250
 incandescents that are reached to see in 

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:58.020
 red at a distance of more than one 

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:59.800
 kilometer and at that time we go to 

00:02:58.020 --> 00:03:01.750
 volcano 

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:03.940
 this is the volcanic activity in that 

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:07.540
 moment 10 o'clock at night with 41 

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:10.300
 minutes center time so it's in 

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:12.520
 this installation at this time that the 

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:15.700
 popocatépetl has not stopped in fact 

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:18.450
 all day have been more than 30 

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:18.450
 exhalations
