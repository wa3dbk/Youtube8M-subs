that we've missed on these other worlds

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:08.000 
that we've missed on these other worlds
I<00:01:06.479> think<00:01:06.960> that's<00:01:07.140> also<00:01:07.500> what's<00:01:07.710> going<00:01:07.860> to<00:01:07.920> be

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.010 
I think that's also what's going to be

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:12.740 
I think that's also what's going to be
part<00:01:08.280> of<00:01:08.400> the<00:01:08.869> DIA<00:01:11.180> let's<00:01:12.180> see<00:01:12.360> the<00:01:12.510> the

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750
