00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:58.729 
decided to do a world showcase on it
because<00:00:56.010> I<00:00:56.070> really<00:00:56.579> liked<00:00:56.760> his<00:00:57.090> build<00:00:57.739> my

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
because I really liked his build my

00:00:58.739 --> 00:00:59.930 
because I really liked his build my
world<00:00:59.039> trade<00:00:59.250> center<00:00:59.550> is<00:00:59.640> meant<00:00:59.820> to<00:00:59.910> be

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
world trade center is meant to be

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:01.849 
world trade center is meant to be
somewhat<00:01:00.449> like<00:01:00.629> the<00:01:00.930> World<00:01:01.260> Trade<00:01:01.440> Center<00:01:01.739> but

00:01:01.849 --> 00:01:01.859 
somewhat like the World Trade Center but

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:04.880 
somewhat like the World Trade Center but
not<00:01:02.010> exactly<00:01:02.520> his<00:01:02.910> is<00:01:03.270> meant<00:01:03.570> to<00:01:03.719> be<00:01:03.750> as<00:01:04.110> close

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
not exactly his is meant to be as close

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:06.530 
not exactly his is meant to be as close
to<00:01:05.010> the<00:01:05.369> original<00:01:05.400> World<00:01:06.030> Trade<00:01:06.210> Center<00:01:06.479> as

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
to the original World Trade Center as

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:08.090 
to the original World Trade Center as
possible<00:01:07.020> and<00:01:07.140> I<00:01:07.229> have<00:01:07.380> to<00:01:07.500> say<00:01:07.530> he<00:01:07.890> did<00:01:08.070> a

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
possible and I have to say he did a

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:10.310 
possible and I have to say he did a
really<00:01:08.189> good<00:01:08.610> job<00:01:08.930> obviously<00:01:09.930> it's<00:01:10.049> scaled

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
really good job obviously it's scaled

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:11.810 
really good job obviously it's scaled
down<00:01:10.409> a<00:01:10.530> little<00:01:10.770> you<00:01:10.979> can't<00:01:11.220> really<00:01:11.430> build<00:01:11.610> a

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
down a little you can't really build a

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:13.010 
down a little you can't really build a
full<00:01:12.060> scale<00:01:12.240> model<00:01:12.600> of<00:01:12.630> the<00:01:12.689> world<00:01:12.840> trade

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
full scale model of the world trade

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:15.710 
full scale model of the world trade
center<00:01:13.380> cuz<00:01:13.619> the<00:01:14.340> height<00:01:14.760> limits<00:01:15.119> only<00:01:15.330> like

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
center cuz the height limits only like

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:18.469 
center cuz the height limits only like
two<00:01:15.840> hundred<00:01:15.930> fifty<00:01:16.200> six<00:01:16.560> blocks<00:01:17.150> and<00:01:18.150> if

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
two hundred fifty six blocks and if

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:20.510 
two hundred fifty six blocks and if
blocks<00:01:18.900> are<00:01:19.170> equal<00:01:19.409> two<00:01:19.530> meters<00:01:19.830> which<00:01:20.040> they

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
blocks are equal two meters which they

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:23.450 
blocks are equal two meters which they
pretty<00:01:20.729> much<00:01:20.820> over<00:01:21.090> three<00:01:21.780> feet<00:01:21.960> that's<00:01:22.890> why<00:01:23.130> i

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
pretty much over three feet that's why i

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:27.080 
pretty much over three feet that's why i
guess<00:01:23.820> steve<00:01:24.180> is<00:01:24.450> six<00:01:25.409> feet<00:01:25.590> high<00:01:25.799> a<00:01:26.580> little

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
guess steve is six feet high a little

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:30.380 
guess steve is six feet high a little
less<00:01:27.210> than<00:01:27.360> six<00:01:27.570> feet<00:01:27.659> high<00:01:28.970> you'd<00:01:29.970> have<00:01:30.090> to<00:01:30.180> go

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.390 
less than six feet high you'd have to go

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:32.390 
less than six feet high you'd have to go
up<00:01:30.600> to<00:01:30.780> I<00:01:30.990> think<00:01:31.290> about<00:01:31.409> four<00:01:31.829> hundred<00:01:31.979> blocks

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:32.400 
up to I think about four hundred blocks

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:36.080 
up to I think about four hundred blocks
probably<00:01:33.180> more<00:01:33.390> to<00:01:34.290> build<00:01:34.560> a<00:01:35.090> one-to-one

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
probably more to build a one-to-one

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:38.359 
probably more to build a one-to-one
scale<00:01:36.270> of<00:01:36.659> the<00:01:36.750> World<00:01:36.900> Trade<00:01:37.079> Center<00:01:37.380> but

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:38.369 
scale of the World Trade Center but

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:40.880 
scale of the World Trade Center but
anyway<00:01:38.820> he<00:01:39.000> did<00:01:39.030> a<00:01:39.180> really<00:01:39.240> good<00:01:39.659> job<00:01:39.720> a<00:01:40.470> lot<00:01:40.860> of

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890 
anyway he did a really good job a lot of

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:42.520 
anyway he did a really good job a lot of
people<00:01:40.979> don't<00:01:41.340> know<00:01:41.460> that<00:01:41.490> the<00:01:41.909> Twin<00:01:42.240> Towers

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:42.530 
people don't know that the Twin Towers

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:44.660 
people don't know that the Twin Towers
weren't<00:01:43.530> the<00:01:43.710> only<00:01:43.740> things<00:01:43.950> that<00:01:44.369> made<00:01:44.490> up<00:01:44.640> the

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670 
weren't the only things that made up the

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:46.429 
weren't the only things that made up the
World<00:01:44.880> Trade<00:01:45.060> Center<00:01:45.390> he<00:01:45.570> built<00:01:45.780> all<00:01:45.990> seven

00:01:52.249 --> 00:01:52.259 
into World Trade Center the South Tower

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:55.910 
into World Trade Center the South Tower
is<00:01:52.590> the<00:01:53.549> tower<00:01:53.909> with<00:01:54.299> the<00:01:54.890> observation<00:01:55.890> deck

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 
is the tower with the observation deck

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:59.719 
is the tower with the observation deck
on<00:01:56.310> it<00:01:56.460> and<00:01:56.640> the<00:01:57.299> North<00:01:57.600> Tower<00:01:57.930> is<00:01:58.320> a<00:01:59.130> deep<00:01:59.579> one

00:01:59.719 --> 00:01:59.729 
on it and the North Tower is a deep one

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:03.289 
on it and the North Tower is a deep one
with<00:01:59.939> the<00:02:00.030> giant<00:02:00.210> antenna<00:02:00.630> on<00:02:00.719> top<00:02:01.369> and<00:02:02.369> I

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:03.299 
with the giant antenna on top and I

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:04.940 
with the giant antenna on top and I
think<00:02:03.540> he<00:02:03.659> actually<00:02:03.869> made<00:02:04.259> the<00:02:04.409> north<00:02:04.590> tower<00:02:04.829> a

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:04.950 
think he actually made the north tower a

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:08.150 
think he actually made the north tower a
little<00:02:05.250> bit<00:02:05.369> taller<00:02:05.399> which<00:02:06.390> is<00:02:07.129> accurate<00:02:08.129> to

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:08.160 
little bit taller which is accurate to

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:10.400 
little bit taller which is accurate to
the<00:02:08.399> actual<00:02:08.970> World<00:02:09.720> Trade<00:02:09.929> Center<00:02:10.259> before

they were destroyed the North Tower was

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:14.550 
they were destroyed the North Tower was

tenants while it was being built and

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:23.820 
tenants while it was being built and
they<00:02:21.510> requested<00:02:22.510> that<00:02:22.720> their<00:02:22.990> floors<00:02:23.470> be<00:02:23.800> a

they requested that their floors be a

they requested that their floors be a

little bit taller than all the other

little bit taller than all the other
floors<00:02:25.570> and<00:02:25.930> since<00:02:26.710> they<00:02:26.860> were<00:02:26.920> going<00:02:27.160> to<00:02:27.310> be

in<00:02:28.030> the<00:02:28.180> north<00:02:28.420> tower<00:02:28.690> they<00:02:29.260> made<00:02:29.470> the<00:02:29.590> north

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:29.770 
in the north tower they made the north

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:32.730 
in the north tower they made the north
tower<00:02:29.980> a<00:02:30.280> little<00:02:30.940> bit<00:02:31.060> taller<00:02:31.090> i<00:02:31.600> think<00:02:32.590> it<00:02:32.680> was

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:32.740 
tower a little bit taller i think it was

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:35.070 
tower a little bit taller i think it was
like<00:02:32.800> two<00:02:33.100> stories<00:02:33.520> they<00:02:33.820> bumped<00:02:34.330> up<00:02:34.450> like<00:02:34.780> an

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:35.080 
like two stories they bumped up like an

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:36.840 
like two stories they bumped up like an
extra<00:02:35.470> foot<00:02:35.650> or<00:02:35.800> something<00:02:35.950> so<00:02:36.490> as<00:02:36.640> a<00:02:36.670> result

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:36.850 
extra foot or something so as a result

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:38.220 
extra foot or something so as a result
the<00:02:37.210> north<00:02:37.390> tower<00:02:37.570> was<00:02:37.840> a<00:02:37.870> little<00:02:38.080> bit<00:02:38.200> taller

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:38.230 
the north tower was a little bit taller

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:40.590 
the north tower was a little bit taller
than<00:02:38.590> the<00:02:38.710> south<00:02:38.890> tower<00:02:39.150> and<00:02:40.150> I<00:02:40.240> think<00:02:40.480> he

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:40.600 
than the south tower and I think he

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:42.780 
than the south tower and I think he
actually<00:02:40.950> compensated<00:02:41.950> for<00:02:42.130> that<00:02:42.160> and<00:02:42.460> that's

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:42.790 
actually compensated for that and that's

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:44.370 
actually compensated for that and that's
a<00:02:43.060> really<00:02:43.270> cool<00:02:43.480> attention<00:02:43.930> to<00:02:44.020> detail<00:02:44.350> that

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:44.380 
a really cool attention to detail that

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:46.770 
a really cool attention to detail that
he<00:02:44.620> put<00:02:44.800> in<00:02:44.950> he<00:02:45.940> also<00:02:46.090> put<00:02:46.300> in<00:02:46.390> three<00:02:46.600> World

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:46.780 
he put in he also put in three World

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:50.010 
he put in he also put in three World
Trade<00:02:46.960> Center<00:02:47.290> which<00:02:47.470> was<00:02:47.770> the<00:02:48.660> the<00:02:49.660> Vista

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:50.020

Hotel<00:02:50.230> at<00:02:50.560> first<00:02:50.770> but<00:02:50.950> it<00:02:51.070> turned<00:02:51.550> to<00:02:51.790> the

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:51.910 
Hotel at first but it turned to the

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:54.930 
Hotel at first but it turned to the
marriott<00:02:52.330> hotel<00:02:52.720> and<00:02:53.010> that<00:02:54.010> is<00:02:54.160> the<00:02:54.430> it<00:02:54.730> was

marriott hotel and that is the it was

like a whitish building that was in
