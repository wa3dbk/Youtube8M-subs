00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.780
 hello everyone hello to all 

00:00:01.530 --> 00:00:06.750
 welcome to a video announces a 

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:08.429
 video announcement disaster disaster 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:10.320
 why disaster as you can 

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:11.090
 to hear it already I have a microphone it's a 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:12.570
 disaster 

00:00:11.090 --> 00:00:15.509
 I am in a situation 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:16.800
 catastrophic I would say big tits 

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:18.029
 I sold my imac 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:19.820
 it allowed to make videos 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:21.600
 until today I sold my imac 

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:23.670
 to buy a pc 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:25.019
 so I already received the pc two days 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:26.849
 more than two weeks later 

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:28.109
 and once I received two days 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:30.449
 after I had to send it back because my 

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:31.800
 graphics card was defective I 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:33.809
 have to wait about two 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:36.390
 weeks that is to say 14 days for those 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:37.620
 who too lazy to calculate for 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:39.660
 jurassic kraft fans needed me 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:41.160
