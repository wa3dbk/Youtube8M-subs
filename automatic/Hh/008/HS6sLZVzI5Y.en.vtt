00:02:20.019 --> 00:02:20.470 
and easy as that be you're going to ruin
you

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:20.480 
you

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:24.369 
you
is<00:02:20.720> because<00:02:21.730> so<00:02:22.750> you're<00:02:23.750> just<00:02:23.900> doing<00:02:24.200> small

00:02:24.369 --> 00:02:24.379 
is because so you're just doing small

00:02:24.379 --> 00:02:28.149 
is because so you're just doing small
snips<00:02:25.120> at<00:02:26.120> a<00:02:26.150> time<00:02:26.709> putting<00:02:27.709> these<00:02:27.950> little

00:02:28.149 --> 00:02:28.159 
snips at a time putting these little

00:02:28.159 --> 00:02:32.619 
snips at a time putting these little
bits<00:02:28.489> off<00:02:28.790> again<00:02:29.599> better<00:02:30.140> time<00:02:31.629> abnormally

00:02:32.619 --> 00:02:32.629 
bits off again better time abnormally

00:02:32.629 --> 00:02:34.420 
bits off again better time abnormally
take<00:02:32.840> a<00:02:32.870> bit<00:02:33.110> more<00:02:33.140> time<00:02:33.319> than<00:02:33.860> this<00:02:34.099> but

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:34.430 
take a bit more time than this but

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:36.729 
take a bit more time than this but
obviously<00:02:34.940> cameras<00:02:35.540> rolling<00:02:36.110> trying<00:02:36.500> to<00:02:36.590> show

00:02:36.729 --> 00:02:36.739 
obviously cameras rolling trying to show

00:02:36.739 --> 00:02:44.380 
obviously cameras rolling trying to show
you<00:02:37.010> that's<00:02:39.250> how<00:02:40.250> they<00:02:40.549> work<00:02:43.330> or<00:02:44.330> not

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:44.390 
you that's how they work or not

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:46.390 
you that's how they work or not
basically<00:02:44.720> you<00:02:45.019> don't<00:02:45.200> want<00:02:45.349> to<00:02:45.440> get<00:02:45.560> bored

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:46.400 
basically you don't want to get bored

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:48.910 
basically you don't want to get bored
out<00:02:46.640> you<00:02:46.849> mind<00:02:47.090> watching<00:02:47.599> me<00:02:47.920> realistically

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:48.920 
out you mind watching me realistically

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:50.890 
out you mind watching me realistically
I've<00:02:49.040> normally<00:02:49.430> have<00:02:49.549> caught<00:02:49.819> this<00:02:50.060> in<00:02:50.480> so

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:50.900 
I've normally have caught this in so

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:53.710 
I've normally have caught this in so
four<00:02:51.140> or<00:02:51.290> five<00:02:51.730> video<00:02:52.730> sections<00:02:53.510> and<00:02:53.690> just

00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:53.720 
four or five video sections and just

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:55.960 
four or five video sections and just
don't<00:02:54.500> half<00:02:54.709> of<00:02:54.890> it<00:02:55.010> behind<00:02:55.160> the<00:02:55.459> scenes<00:02:55.700> so

00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:55.970 
don't half of it behind the scenes so

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:57.850 
don't half of it behind the scenes so
I'm<00:02:56.060> not<00:02:56.209> bothering<00:02:56.690> you<00:02:56.720> but<00:02:57.049> this<00:02:57.650> is<00:02:57.829> a

00:02:57.860 --> 00:03:00.099 
I'm not bothering you but this is a
blast<00:02:58.220> key<00:02:58.549> and<00:02:58.879> it<00:02:59.030> was<00:02:59.180> fairly<00:02:59.510> close<00:02:59.870> to<00:03:00.079> the

00:03:00.099 --> 00:03:00.109 
blast key and it was fairly close to the

00:03:00.109 --> 00:03:03.880 
blast key and it was fairly close to the
dimensions<00:03:00.920> I<00:03:01.069> wanted<00:03:02.290> I'm<00:03:03.290> just<00:03:03.560> doing<00:03:03.799> it

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:03.890 
dimensions I wanted I'm just doing it

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:06.220 
dimensions I wanted I'm just doing it
all<00:03:04.040> live<00:03:04.340> so<00:03:04.700> you<00:03:04.790> can<00:03:04.879> see<00:03:05.299> if<00:03:05.780> you've<00:03:06.019> got

to<00:03:12.170> knock<00:03:12.349> up<00:03:12.500> a<00:03:12.620> bump<00:03:12.829> key<00:03:13.299> yeah<00:03:14.299> that's<00:03:14.780> one's

00:03:15.069 --> 00:03:15.079 
to knock up a bump key yeah that's one's

00:03:15.079 --> 00:03:17.110 
to knock up a bump key yeah that's one's
slightly<00:03:15.500> out<00:03:15.890> at<00:03:16.040> the<00:03:16.129> bottom<00:03:16.310> so<00:03:16.579> straighten

it again and we're just gonna go over

00:03:19.069 --> 00:03:22.809 
it again and we're just gonna go over
them<00:03:19.549> like<00:03:19.579> spins<00:03:20.150> I've<00:03:20.480> done<00:03:20.720> just<00:03:21.519> to<00:03:22.519> check

00:03:22.809 --> 00:03:22.819 
them like spins I've done just to check

00:03:22.819 --> 00:03:24.369 
them like spins I've done just to check
they're<00:03:23.480> all<00:03:23.660> okay

00:03:24.369 --> 00:03:24.379 
they're all okay

they're all okay
see<00:03:24.950> how<00:03:25.040> that's<00:03:25.190> just<00:03:25.459> sliding<00:03:26.090> straight

00:03:26.349 --> 00:03:26.359 
see how that's just sliding straight

00:03:26.359 --> 00:03:30.039 
see how that's just sliding straight
through<00:03:27.220> that<00:03:28.220> tells<00:03:28.579> me<00:03:28.910> see<00:03:29.329> this<00:03:29.480> one<00:03:29.720> isn't

00:03:30.039 --> 00:03:30.049 
through that tells me see this one isn't

00:03:30.049 --> 00:03:32.020 
through that tells me see this one isn't
that<00:03:30.799> tells<00:03:31.069> me<00:03:31.280> when<00:03:31.459> the<00:03:31.549> slide<00:03:31.760> straight

00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:32.030 
that tells me when the slide straight

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:33.960 
that tells me when the slide straight
through<00:03:32.329> like<00:03:32.510> that<00:03:32.750> you've<00:03:32.930> got<00:03:33.109> it<00:03:33.230> right

00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:33.970 
through like that you've got it right

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:38.259 
through like that you've got it right
just<00:03:34.970> be<00:03:35.180> stick<00:03:35.540> you<00:03:36.200> haven't<00:03:36.880> right<00:03:37.880> I<00:03:38.120> don't

00:03:38.259 --> 00:03:38.269 
just be stick you haven't right I don't

00:03:38.269 --> 00:03:40.120 
just be stick you haven't right I don't
think<00:03:38.510> that's<00:03:38.810> taken<00:03:39.260> long<00:03:39.500> it<00:03:39.769> might<00:03:39.889> just

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:40.130 
think that's taken long it might just

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:41.470 
think that's taken long it might just
seem<00:03:40.370> quick<00:03:40.639> because<00:03:40.730> I'm<00:03:40.910> doing<00:03:41.090> if<00:03:41.299> you're

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:41.480 
seem quick because I'm doing if you're

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:43.740 
seem quick because I'm doing if you're
still<00:03:41.690> awake<00:03:41.840> it<00:03:42.260> hasn't<00:03:42.530> taken<00:03:42.709> that<00:03:43.099> long

00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:43.750 
still awake it hasn't taken that long

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:46.920 
still awake it hasn't taken that long
there<00:03:44.750> you<00:03:44.900> go<00:03:45.109> just<00:03:45.470> name<00:03:45.650> yourself<00:03:45.950> a<00:03:46.040> bumpy

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:46.930 
there you go just name yourself a bumpy

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:52.270 
there you go just name yourself a bumpy
basically<00:03:47.930> all<00:03:48.079> I<00:03:48.109> do<00:03:48.260> now<00:03:48.709> I'd<00:03:49.069> get<00:03:51.099> what's<00:03:52.099> it

00:03:52.270 --> 00:03:52.280 
basically all I do now I'd get what's it

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:54.039 
basically all I do now I'd get what's it
got<00:03:52.489> a<00:03:52.519> thin<00:03:52.760> file<00:03:53.060> and<00:03:53.389> I've<00:03:53.480> just<00:03:53.660> run<00:03:53.900> the

00:03:54.039 --> 00:03:54.049 
got a thin file and I've just run the

00:03:54.049 --> 00:03:56.020 
got a thin file and I've just run the
file<00:03:54.290> across<00:03:54.620> it<00:03:54.980> and<00:03:55.160> just<00:03:55.459> take<00:03:55.700> a<00:03:55.730> few

00:03:56.020 --> 00:03:56.030 
file across it and just take a few

00:03:56.030 --> 00:04:01.890 
file across it and just take a few
little<00:03:56.209> bits<00:03:56.480> out<00:03:56.739> see<00:03:57.739> if<00:03:57.769> we<00:03:57.950> can<00:03:58.160> get<00:03:58.310> that

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:01.900 

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:04.180 

basically<00:04:02.900> that's<00:04:03.200> it<00:04:03.440> you've<00:04:03.889> just

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:04.190 
basically that's it you've just

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:06.369 
basically that's it you've just
replicated<00:04:04.879> a<00:04:04.940> bunkie<00:04:05.419> that<00:04:05.870> I<00:04:05.900> bump<00:04:06.139> a<00:04:06.230> lot

00:04:06.369 --> 00:04:06.379 
replicated a bunkie that I bump a lot

00:04:06.379 --> 00:04:10.690 
replicated a bunkie that I bump a lot
now<00:04:06.590> so<00:04:07.430> easy<00:04:07.639> is<00:04:07.849> that<00:04:08.260> we<00:04:09.260> Shankar<00:04:09.859> is<00:04:10.040> well

00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:10.700 
now so easy is that we Shankar is well

00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:13.329 
now so easy is that we Shankar is well
worth<00:04:11.000> the<00:04:11.030> money
