I do I just keep it really close to my
lash<00:02:10.450> line<00:02:10.780> I<00:02:11.050> try<00:02:11.470> to<00:02:11.530> keep<00:02:11.680> the<00:02:11.800> line<00:02:11.950> beright

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:12.250 
lash line I try to keep the line beright

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:13.830 
lash line I try to keep the line beright
then<00:02:12.519> just<00:02:12.760> end<00:02:12.910> my<00:02:13.000> lashes<00:02:13.239> look<00:02:13.569> a<00:02:13.690> lot

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:15.970 
longer there's not like a big black line

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:17.580 
longer there's not like a big black line
behind<00:02:16.390> my<00:02:16.600> lashes<00:02:16.840> making<00:02:17.380> them<00:02:17.500> appear

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:17.590 
behind my lashes making them appear

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:19.710 
behind my lashes making them appear
shorter<00:02:18.160> so<00:02:18.760> I<00:02:18.790> just<00:02:19.060> try<00:02:19.209> to<00:02:19.239> keep<00:02:19.360> it<00:02:19.540> very

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:19.720 
shorter so I just try to keep it very

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:22.410 
close and then I also like to wing it
out<00:02:21.550> on<00:02:21.640> the<00:02:21.760> end<00:02:21.880> that's<00:02:22.000> just<00:02:22.209> gonna

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:22.420 
out on the end that's just gonna

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:23.820 
out on the end that's just gonna
elongate<00:02:22.660> my<00:02:22.959> eyes<00:02:23.140> and<00:02:23.410> keep<00:02:23.530> them<00:02:23.560> from

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:23.830

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:25.890 
elongate my eyes and keep them from
looking<00:02:24.160> so<00:02:24.400> round<00:02:24.940> and<00:02:25.090> almond<00:02:25.450> like<00:02:25.660> because

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:25.900 
looking so round and almond like because

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:28.380 
looking so round and almond like because
my<00:02:26.019> eyes<00:02:26.140> are<00:02:26.350> really<00:02:26.440> small<00:02:26.799> so<00:02:27.130> and<00:02:27.519> for<00:02:28.269> that

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:28.390 
my eyes are really small so and for that

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:31.770 
my eyes are really small so and for that
I<00:02:28.450> usually<00:02:28.810> I<00:02:29.489> just<00:02:30.489> angled<00:02:31.269> a<00:02:31.330> point<00:02:31.600> down

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:31.780 
I usually I just angled a point down

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:33.330 
I usually I just angled a point down
towards<00:02:32.019> my<00:02:32.260> eye<00:02:32.290> like<00:02:32.590> that<00:02:32.799> and<00:02:33.040> I<00:02:33.069> put<00:02:33.220> it

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:33.340 
towards my eye like that and I put it

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:35.820 
towards my eye like that and I put it
right<00:02:33.370> in<00:02:33.670> the<00:02:33.760> corner<00:02:34.049> and<00:02:35.049> I<00:02:35.380> just<00:02:35.590> gently

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:35.830 
right in the corner and I just gently

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:39.449 
right in the corner and I just gently
look<00:02:36.430> it<00:02:36.580> up<00:02:36.700> like<00:02:36.910> that<00:02:37.620> and<00:02:38.620> again<00:02:39.160> I'm<00:02:39.430> just

00:02:39.449 --> 00:02:39.459 
look it up like that and again I'm just

00:02:39.459 --> 00:02:41.310 
look it up like that and again I'm just
kind<00:02:39.790> of<00:02:39.850> dabbing<00:02:40.269> it<00:02:40.390> on<00:02:40.480> I'm<00:02:40.660> not<00:02:40.840> enrolling

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:41.320 
kind of dabbing it on I'm not enrolling

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:42.240 
kind of dabbing it on I'm not enrolling
a<00:02:41.590> line<00:02:41.739> on<00:02:41.920> my<00:02:42.040> eye

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:42.250 
a line on my eye

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:45.390 
a line on my eye
it<00:02:42.940> also<00:02:43.150> will<00:02:43.720> keep<00:02:43.959> it<00:02:44.140> from<00:02:44.380> tugging<00:02:45.310> your

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:45.400 
it also will keep it from tugging your

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:48.680 
it also will keep it from tugging your
eye<00:02:45.459> too<00:02:45.610> that<00:02:45.970> way

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:48.690 

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:50.930 

I<00:02:48.750> also<00:02:49.410> like<00:02:49.770> to<00:02:49.920> connect<00:02:50.220> that<00:02:50.340> Lane<00:02:50.550> down<00:02:50.760> to

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:50.940 
I also like to connect that Lane down to

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:52.790 
I also like to connect that Lane down to
the<00:02:51.030> lower<00:02:51.240> lash<00:02:51.510> line<00:02:51.540> once<00:02:52.380> I<00:02:52.470> get<00:02:52.620> down<00:02:52.740> here

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:52.800 
the lower lash line once I get down here

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:55.190 
the lower lash line once I get down here
to<00:02:53.070> the<00:02:53.100> bottom<00:02:53.520> then<00:02:54.240> I<00:02:54.300> just<00:02:54.510> kind<00:02:54.690> of<00:02:54.750> dab<00:02:55.020> it

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:55.200 
to the bottom then I just kind of dab it

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:57.320 
to the bottom then I just kind of dab it
in<00:02:55.320> between<00:02:55.470> my<00:02:55.680> lashes<00:02:56.010> very<00:02:56.310> lightly<00:02:56.880> and

00:02:57.320 --> 00:02:57.330 
in between my lashes very lightly and

00:02:57.330 --> 00:02:59.330 
in between my lashes very lightly and
then<00:02:57.840> I<00:02:57.870> like<00:02:58.050> to<00:02:58.140> just<00:02:58.200> take<00:02:58.500> my<00:02:58.680> finger<00:02:59.130> and

00:02:59.330 --> 00:02:59.340 
then I like to just take my finger and

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:02.060 
then I like to just take my finger and
just<00:02:59.580> kind<00:02:59.820> of<00:02:59.910> smudge<00:03:00.270> it<00:03:00.420> a<00:03:00.480> little<00:03:00.660> bit<00:03:01.070> just

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:02.070 
just kind of smudge it a little bit just

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:03.590 
just kind of smudge it a little bit just
because<00:03:02.130> I<00:03:02.340> don't<00:03:02.400> want<00:03:02.880> there<00:03:03.090> to<00:03:03.120> be<00:03:03.300> an

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:03.600 
because I don't want there to be an

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:06.620 
because I don't want there to be an
apparent<00:03:04.140> line<00:03:04.350> right<00:03:04.680> there<00:03:05.420> so<00:03:06.420> that's

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:06.630 
apparent line right there so that's

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:08.750 
apparent line right there so that's
about<00:03:06.750> as<00:03:07.050> far<00:03:07.380> and<00:03:07.620> as<00:03:07.740> I<00:03:07.890> go<00:03:08.070> you<00:03:08.310> can<00:03:08.460> take<00:03:08.490> it

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:08.760 
about as far and as I go you can take it

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:09.890 
about as far and as I go you can take it
in<00:03:08.880> farther<00:03:09.120> if<00:03:09.270> you<00:03:09.420> want<00:03:09.630> if<00:03:09.750> you<00:03:09.870> have

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:09.900 
in farther if you want if you have

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:11.750 
in farther if you want if you have
larger<00:03:10.440> eyes<00:03:10.590> but<00:03:10.890> for<00:03:11.070> me<00:03:11.220> they're<00:03:11.580> very

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:11.760 
larger eyes but for me they're very

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:14.990 
larger eyes but for me they're very
small<00:03:12.180> so<00:03:12.600> I<00:03:12.630> like<00:03:12.870> to<00:03:13.020> keep<00:03:13.200> it<00:03:13.580> just<00:03:14.580> on<00:03:14.790> that

00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:15.000 
small so I like to keep it just on that

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:16.670 
small so I like to keep it just on that
outer<00:03:15.240> portion<00:03:15.810> right<00:03:15.990> there<00:03:16.200> it<00:03:16.320> really<00:03:16.500> just

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:16.680 
outer portion right there it really just

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:18.640 
outer portion right there it really just
makes<00:03:17.010> my<00:03:17.160> eyes<00:03:17.310> stand<00:03:17.640> out<00:03:17.850> more<00:03:18.090> than<00:03:18.150> that

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:18.650 
makes my eyes stand out more than that

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:21.500 
makes my eyes stand out more than that
and<00:03:19.650> you<00:03:20.040> can<00:03:20.220> make<00:03:20.250> the<00:03:20.520> wing<00:03:20.700> as<00:03:20.940> long<00:03:21.210> as<00:03:21.390> you

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:21.510 
and you can make the wing as long as you

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:23.120 
and you can make the wing as long as you
want<00:03:21.690> I<00:03:21.810> just<00:03:21.840> like<00:03:22.020> to<00:03:22.200> keep<00:03:22.320> it<00:03:22.470> very<00:03:22.650> natural

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:23.130 
want I just like to keep it very natural

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:24.410 
want I just like to keep it very natural
just<00:03:23.400> to<00:03:23.460> make<00:03:23.610> it<00:03:23.730> look<00:03:23.880> like<00:03:24.030> my<00:03:24.210> eye<00:03:24.240> is

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:24.420 
just to make it look like my eye is

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:26.900 
just to make it look like my eye is
shaped<00:03:24.810> like<00:03:24.930> that<00:03:25.070> but<00:03:26.070> you<00:03:26.220> could<00:03:26.460> make<00:03:26.730> it

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:26.910 
shaped like that but you could make it

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:29.000 
shaped like that but you could make it
look<00:03:26.940> more<00:03:27.270> like<00:03:27.330> a<00:03:27.480> dramatic<00:03:27.960> wing<00:03:28.200> using<00:03:28.770> a

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:29.010 
look more like a dramatic wing using a

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:30.500 
look more like a dramatic wing using a
pencil<00:03:29.340> eyeliner<00:03:29.460> is<00:03:29.850> actually<00:03:30.150> a<00:03:30.210> lot<00:03:30.330> easier

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:30.510 
pencil eyeliner is actually a lot easier

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:32.420 
pencil eyeliner is actually a lot easier
than<00:03:30.900> a<00:03:30.960> liquid<00:03:31.290> liner<00:03:31.470> so<00:03:32.040> if<00:03:32.130> you<00:03:32.220> want<00:03:32.400> to

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:32.430 
than a liquid liner so if you want to

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:34.460 
than a liquid liner so if you want to
create<00:03:32.640> that<00:03:32.820> same<00:03:33.150> dramatic<00:03:33.630> like<00:03:34.140> a<00:03:34.170> liquid

00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:34.470 
create that same dramatic like a liquid

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:36.020 
create that same dramatic like a liquid
liner<00:03:34.590> look<00:03:34.920> with<00:03:35.100> a<00:03:35.130> pencil<00:03:35.370> you<00:03:35.640> could<00:03:35.880> do

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:36.030 
liner look with a pencil you could do

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:37.900 
liner look with a pencil you could do
that<00:03:36.180> as<00:03:36.360> well

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:37.910 
that as well

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:40.160 
that as well
so<00:03:38.910> as<00:03:39.000> you<00:03:39.120> can<00:03:39.270> see<00:03:39.480> the<00:03:39.630> difference<00:03:39.930> in<00:03:40.080> my

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:40.170 
so as you can see the difference in my

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:41.420 
so as you can see the difference in my
eyes<00:03:40.350> you<00:03:40.590> can<00:03:40.740> tell<00:03:40.770> this<00:03:41.100> one<00:03:41.280> definitely

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:41.430 
eyes you can tell this one definitely

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:43.940 
eyes you can tell this one definitely
stands<00:03:41.910> out<00:03:42.120> more<00:03:42.330> just<00:03:42.930> looks<00:03:43.110> more<00:03:43.230> awake

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:43.950 
stands out more just looks more awake

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:46.490 
stands out more just looks more awake
and<00:03:44.160> it<00:03:44.310> looks<00:03:44.430> a<00:03:44.550> lot<00:03:44.670> better<00:03:45.290> so<00:03:46.290> another

00:03:46.490 --> 00:03:46.500 
and it looks a lot better so another

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:48.110 
and it looks a lot better so another
thing<00:03:46.590> I<00:03:46.800> also<00:03:46.980> like<00:03:47.220> to<00:03:47.340> do<00:03:47.460> is<00:03:47.640> just<00:03:47.850> take<00:03:48.060> a

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:48.120 
thing I also like to do is just take a

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:50.510 
thing I also like to do is just take a
skin<00:03:48.600> tone<00:03:48.810> eyeliner<00:03:49.230> this<00:03:49.470> one<00:03:49.680> is<00:03:49.980> by<00:03:50.250> NYX

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:50.520 
skin tone eyeliner this one is by NYX

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:52.310 
skin tone eyeliner this one is by NYX
and<00:03:50.700> it's<00:03:50.850> called<00:03:51.090> the<00:03:51.240> wonder<00:03:51.600> pencil<00:03:51.990> this

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:52.320 
and it's called the wonder pencil this

00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:53.780 
and it's called the wonder pencil this
can<00:03:52.560> be<00:03:52.650> used<00:03:52.800> as<00:03:52.920> a<00:03:52.980> concealer<00:03:53.370> or<00:03:53.700> an

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:53.790 
can be used as a concealer or an

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:55.340 
can be used as a concealer or an
eyeliner<00:03:54.180> but<00:03:54.360> I<00:03:54.420> think<00:03:54.630> it<00:03:54.720> works<00:03:54.900> best<00:03:55.080> as<00:03:55.230> an

00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:55.350 
eyeliner but I think it works best as an

00:03:55.350 --> 00:03:57.080 
eyeliner but I think it works best as an
eyeliner<00:03:55.560> it's<00:03:56.130> in<00:03:56.250> the<00:03:56.340> shade<00:03:56.550> light<00:03:56.580> tube

00:03:57.080 --> 00:03:57.090 
eyeliner it's in the shade light tube

00:03:57.090 --> 00:03:59.150 
eyeliner it's in the shade light tube
this<00:03:57.239> comes<00:03:57.480> in<00:03:57.630> some<00:03:57.780> other<00:03:57.930> shades<00:03:58.230> and<00:03:59.070> I

00:03:59.150 --> 00:03:59.160 
this comes in some other shades and I

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:00.710 
this comes in some other shades and I
just<00:03:59.370> put<00:03:59.520> this<00:03:59.670> right<00:03:59.760> on<00:04:00.030> my<00:04:00.150> waterline<00:04:00.480> you

00:04:00.710 --> 00:04:00.720 
just put this right on my waterline you

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:02.660 
just put this right on my waterline you
just<00:04:00.900> want<00:04:01.080> to<00:04:01.110> gently<00:04:01.440> expose<00:04:02.100> that<00:04:02.280> part<00:04:02.550> of

just want to gently expose that part of
eye

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:04.870 
eye

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:07.229 
eye
I<00:04:04.930> just<00:04:05.860> run<00:04:06.099> that<00:04:06.250> along<00:04:06.580> the<00:04:06.730> inner<00:04:06.909> ramp

00:04:07.229 --> 00:04:07.239 
I just run that along the inner ramp

00:04:07.239 --> 00:04:09.300 
I just run that along the inner ramp
this<00:04:07.629> works<00:04:07.900> perfectly<00:04:08.319> in<00:04:08.739> the<00:04:08.830> mornings<00:04:09.190> but

00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:09.310 
this works perfectly in the mornings but

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:11.789 
this works perfectly in the mornings but
I'm<00:04:09.430> really<00:04:09.730> tired<00:04:09.940> because<00:04:10.930> it<00:04:11.230> covers<00:04:11.650> up

00:04:11.789 --> 00:04:11.799 
I'm really tired because it covers up

00:04:11.799 --> 00:04:13.800 
I'm really tired because it covers up
any<00:04:12.040> of<00:04:12.159> that<00:04:12.340> redness<00:04:12.790> on<00:04:12.970> your<00:04:13.030> skin<00:04:13.480> and<00:04:13.690> it

any of that redness on your skin and it
just<00:04:13.989> brightens<00:04:14.500> up<00:04:14.590> your<00:04:14.769> eyes<00:04:14.890> and<00:04:14.920> it's<00:04:15.400> so

00:04:15.570 --> 00:04:15.580 
just brightens up your eyes and it's so

00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:18.180 
just brightens up your eyes and it's so
subtle<00:04:15.959> it<00:04:16.959> looks<00:04:17.199> extremely<00:04:17.650> natural

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:18.190 
subtle it looks extremely natural

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:19.469 
subtle it looks extremely natural
