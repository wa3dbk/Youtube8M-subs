00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:27.190
 let's imagine that we have changed some 

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:29.620
 parameters and have achieved ships 

00:00:27.190 --> 00:00:31.720
 damage the computer we are not able to 

00:00:29.620 --> 00:00:34.000
 to recognize a hard disk for a 

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:36.520
 floppy disk or we do not remember a 

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:39.400
 solution would be to restore the copy of 

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:40.770
 security of the bios we had for 

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:43.860
 which 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:46.800
 we give power we turn on our 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:49.920
 computer and press the delete key 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:52.790
 f8 escape depending on the version of 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:52.790
 lips that we have 

00:00:57.550 --> 00:01:01.469
 here it tells us to press on him 

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:10.220
 If you do not have security key 

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:13.280
 entry we can directly enter 

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:15.380
 This menu will ask us for a password 

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:17.170
 user to be able to enter as 

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:20.299
 administrator in the bios and manipulate it 

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:22.520
 we could have imagined having changed 

00:01:20.299 --> 00:01:25.149
 some parameter of this having 

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:25.149
 spoiled 

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:32.430
 and if we did not know how to recognize it again 

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:34.440
 again put to its original state then 

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:37.770
 how are we solve this problem 

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:38.970
 press f8 and restore the image of 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:41.130
 the bios that we had saved 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:43.770
 previously 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:47.070
 with efe 8 tells us that if we want 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:49.460
 enter the utility figures we tell you 

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:49.460
 yes 

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:56.460
 and now we must therefore restore 

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:59.370
 the image for which the diskette where 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:01.860
 we have saved the bios we introduce 

00:01:59.370 --> 00:02:04.180
 in the floppy disk drive 

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:07.200
 let's update 

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:07.200
 information 

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:11.830
 he remembered us we remembered that we put 

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:14.140
 lip prints 

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:17.130
 there are the ones that give you the copy that 

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:17.130
 we did initially 

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:24.159
 and as we see how we are doing 

00:02:20.829 --> 00:02:24.159
 updating life 

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:33.780
 First you are reading and then you will go 

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:37.409
 saving those bytes this to continue 

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:40.980
 and save that information we tell you that 

00:02:37.409 --> 00:02:44.340
 yes and now is erasing the above and 

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:46.830
 updating with the new information 

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:49.780
 this information is the original 

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:53.740
 the one that we had initially 

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:56.890
 with which we would have again the 

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:58.810
 full bios image without the 

00:02:56.890 --> 00:03:00.660
 failures that we could have 

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:04.730
 task 

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:04.730
 Now we press f10 to exit 

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:11.540
 efe 10 press enter to continue and 

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:14.349
 we would have already done the implantation 

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:14.349
 of the new biopsy
