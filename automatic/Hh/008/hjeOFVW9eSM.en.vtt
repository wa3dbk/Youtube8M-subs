00:00:44.819 --> 00:00:44.829 

00:00:44.829 --> 00:00:47.470 

my<00:00:45.829> favorite<00:00:46.160> part<00:00:46.340> about<00:00:46.430> this<00:00:46.699> is<00:00:46.969> actually

00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:47.480 
my favorite part about this is actually

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:49.720 
my favorite part about this is actually
that<00:00:47.660> asymmetrical<00:00:48.379> zipper<00:00:48.739> and<00:00:49.250> it<00:00:49.340> looks<00:00:49.489> so

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:49.730 
that asymmetrical zipper and it looks so

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:52.209 
that asymmetrical zipper and it looks so
cool<00:00:49.760> and<00:00:50.360> it<00:00:50.840> really<00:00:51.050> adds<00:00:51.320> an<00:00:51.559> edge<00:00:51.769> to<00:00:51.800> the

00:00:52.209 --> 00:00:52.219 
cool and it really adds an edge to the

00:00:52.219 --> 00:00:57.420 
cool and it really adds an edge to the
outfit

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:57.430 

00:00:57.430 --> 00:00:59.770 

it's<00:00:58.430> really<00:00:58.610> hard<00:00:58.700> to<00:00:58.910> style<00:00:59.210> pattern<00:00:59.480> types

00:00:59.770 --> 00:00:59.780 
it's really hard to style pattern types

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:02.410 
it's really hard to style pattern types
I<00:01:00.079> find<00:01:00.350> but<00:01:00.980> since<00:01:01.370> there's<00:01:01.610> some<00:01:01.820> green<00:01:02.120> in

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:02.420 
I find but since there's some green in

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:04.660 
I find but since there's some green in
the<00:01:02.870> tights<00:01:03.079> and<00:01:03.440> I<00:01:03.739> got<00:01:03.860> this<00:01:03.980> brief<00:01:04.250> over

00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:04.670

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:06.470 
they look great together and it's super

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:07.510 
they look great together and it's super
comfortable<00:01:06.680> but<00:01:07.040> you<00:01:07.130> still<00:01:07.370> look<00:01:07.490> really

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:07.520
