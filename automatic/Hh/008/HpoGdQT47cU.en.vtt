00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:53.240 
more and then yeah it it took a while i
was<00:01:51.180> a<00:01:51.240> slow<00:01:51.540> starter<00:01:52.200> I<00:01:52.439> think<00:01:52.799> they<00:01:53.100> would

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:53.250 
was a slow starter I think they would

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:56.240 
was a slow starter I think they would
probably<00:01:53.520> agree<00:01:53.790> and<00:01:54.689> then<00:01:54.840> and<00:01:55.229> then<00:01:55.829> once<00:01:56.100> I

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:56.250 
probably agree and then and then once I

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:58.370 
probably agree and then and then once I
got<00:01:56.280> the<00:01:56.460> hang<00:01:56.490> of<00:01:56.850> it<00:01:57.090> I<00:01:57.270> got<00:01:57.570> I<00:01:57.780> got<00:01:57.899> really

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:03.109 
got the hang of it I got I got really
into<00:01:59.100> it<00:01:59.130> and<00:01:59.899> involved<00:02:00.899> and<00:02:01.079> I<00:02:01.200> felt<00:02:01.880> it<00:02:02.880> was

into it and involved and I felt it was
very<00:02:03.299> liberating<00:02:03.540> in
