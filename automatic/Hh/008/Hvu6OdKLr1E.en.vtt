and I'm doing the 750 milliliter bottles
here<00:01:09.840> which<00:01:10.080> is<00:01:10.200> around<00:01:10.470> 25<00:01:11.040> ounces<00:01:11.460> but<00:01:12.090> I<00:01:12.150> did

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
here which is around 25 ounces but I did

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:14.780 
here which is around 25 ounces but I did
pour<00:01:12.600> some<00:01:12.810> out<00:01:12.930> which<00:01:13.560> will<00:01:13.920> be<00:01:14.100> used<00:01:14.580> later

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
pour some out which will be used later

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:18.320

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
maybe someone will drink it so I can

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:21.020 
maybe someone will drink it so I can
make<00:01:18.479> room<00:01:18.689> for<00:01:18.930> the<00:01:19.200> beans<00:01:19.409> and<00:01:19.909> what<00:01:20.909> I'm

doing<00:01:21.330> is<00:01:21.450> I'm<00:01:21.600> naturally<00:01:21.810> going<00:01:22.229> to<00:01:22.409> slice

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:22.619 
doing is I'm naturally going to slice

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:25.070 
doing is I'm naturally going to slice
the<00:01:22.799> beans<00:01:23.009> and<00:01:23.670> split<00:01:24.000> them<00:01:24.150> in<00:01:24.240> half<00:01:24.270> I'm

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 
the beans and split them in half I'm

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:28.210 
the beans and split them in half I'm
gonna<00:01:25.439> actually<00:01:25.680> just<00:01:25.950> cut<00:01:26.430> them<00:01:26.640> into<00:01:27.450> about

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:28.220 
gonna actually just cut them into about

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:32.090 
gonna actually just cut them into about
3/4<00:01:29.220> maybe<00:01:29.939> to<00:01:30.869> an<00:01:30.990> inch<00:01:31.229> length

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 
3/4 maybe to an inch length

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:34.580 
3/4 maybe to an inch length
and<00:01:32.549> I'm<00:01:32.880> just<00:01:32.939> gonna<00:01:33.200> put<00:01:34.200> them<00:01:34.350> in<00:01:34.439> a<00:01:34.560> jar

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
and I'm just gonna put them in a jar

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:36.620 
and I'm just gonna put them in a jar
here<00:01:35.100> now<00:01:35.759> already<00:01:35.909> put<00:01:36.150> some<00:01:36.299> in<00:01:36.420> there

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
here now already put some in there

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:38.810 
here now already put some in there
because<00:01:37.229> if<00:01:37.380> they<00:01:37.710> take<00:01:37.920> a<00:01:37.950> while<00:01:38.189> since<00:01:38.700> I'm

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820 
because if they take a while since I'm

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:43.429 
because if they take a while since I'm
doing<00:01:39.710> one<00:01:40.850> big<00:01:41.850> one<00:01:42.119> bean<00:01:42.420> per<00:01:42.720> ounce<00:01:42.899> which

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:43.439 
doing one big one bean per ounce which

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:45.260 
doing one big one bean per ounce which
is<00:01:43.470> what<00:01:43.740> they<00:01:43.979> quit<00:01:44.220> is<00:01:44.399> the<00:01:44.610> equivalent<00:01:45.090> of

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:45.270 
is what they quit is the equivalent of

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:49.370 
is what they quit is the equivalent of
the<00:01:45.990> 1/4<00:01:46.920> pound<00:01:47.100> of<00:01:47.220> beans<00:01:47.460> for<00:01:48.240> per<00:01:48.810> quart<00:01:49.110> of

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380 
the 1/4 pound of beans for per quart of

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:50.149 
the 1/4 pound of beans for per quart of
vodka

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:50.159 
vodka

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:52.760 
vodka
so<00:01:50.520> I<00:01:50.549> estimated<00:01:51.420> about<00:01:51.509> one<00:01:52.140> bean<00:01:52.380> per<00:01:52.590> ounce

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:52.770 
so I estimated about one bean per ounce

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:55.969 
so I estimated about one bean per ounce
of<00:01:53.130> vodka<00:01:53.610> and<00:01:54.149> so<00:01:55.020> this<00:01:55.170> thing<00:01:55.350> I<00:01:55.500> did<00:01:55.649> earlier

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:55.979 
of vodka and so this thing I did earlier

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:59.569

shake it already so let me cut this up

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:08.719 
shake it already so let me cut this up
here<00:02:05.700> and<00:02:06.710> we'll<00:02:07.710> put<00:02:08.129> them<00:02:08.190> in<00:02:08.280> the<00:02:08.399> bottle

of vanilla beans in the bottle you'd
want<00:02:17.500> to<00:02:17.620> shake<00:02:18.580> it<00:02:18.610> a<00:02:19.180> couple<00:02:19.750> times<00:02:20.050> a<00:02:20.170> week

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:20.340 
want to shake it a couple times a week

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:27.420 
want to shake it a couple times a week
for<00:02:21.340> the<00:02:22.200> first<00:02:23.640> couple<00:02:24.640> months<00:02:25.170> and<00:02:26.430> after

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:27.430 
for the first couple months and after

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:30.030 
for the first couple months and after
that<00:02:27.670> you<00:02:27.820> can<00:02:27.850> just<00:02:28.000> leave<00:02:28.330> it<00:02:28.360> to<00:02:28.870> brew<00:02:29.140> now

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:30.040 
that you can just leave it to brew now

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:32.310 
that you can just leave it to brew now
it<00:02:30.160> generally<00:02:30.430> takes<00:02:30.550> about<00:02:30.730> two<00:02:31.420> months<00:02:31.930> for

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:32.320 
it generally takes about two months for

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:34.710 
it generally takes about two months for
the<00:02:32.650> vanilla<00:02:33.100> extract<00:02:33.520> to<00:02:33.640> brew<00:02:33.880> but<00:02:34.600> the

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:34.720 
the vanilla extract to brew but the

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:36.660 
the vanilla extract to brew but the
longer<00:02:35.080> it<00:02:35.110> sits<00:02:35.380> the<00:02:35.560> better<00:02:35.680> it<00:02:36.040> gets<00:02:36.070> and

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:36.670 
longer it sits the better it gets and

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:39.180 
longer it sits the better it gets and
I'm<00:02:36.880> going<00:02:37.120> to<00:02:37.180> actually<00:02:37.420> make<00:02:37.780> these<00:02:38.190> as

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:39.190

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:46.840 
after this first part I will show you

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:49.770 
after this first part I will show you
how<00:02:47.140> I'm<00:02:47.200> going<00:02:47.380> to<00:02:47.530> bottle<00:02:47.800> them<00:02:47.920> up<00:02:48.070> and<00:02:48.970> how

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:49.780 
how I'm going to bottle them up and how

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:53.570 
how I'm going to bottle them up and how
I<00:02:49.810> found<00:02:50.380> some<00:02:50.590> labels<00:02:51.010> that<00:02:51.730> I<00:02:51.820> got<00:02:52.000> for<00:02:52.209> free

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:53.580 
I found some labels that I got for free

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:56.100 
I found some labels that I got for free
and<00:02:54.580> so<00:02:55.030> I<00:02:55.090> can<00:02:55.270> show<00:02:55.390> you<00:02:55.480> how<00:02:55.600> they<00:02:55.750> look<00:02:55.930> like

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:56.110 
and so I can show you how they look like

00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:59.940 
and so I can show you how they look like
when<00:02:56.709> I<00:02:56.830> give<00:02:57.310> them<00:02:57.370> away<00:02:57.490> as<00:02:57.610> gifts<00:02:58.950> I'm

00:02:59.940 --> 00:02:59.950 
when I give them away as gifts I'm

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:02.780 
when I give them away as gifts I'm
thinking<00:03:00.310> about<00:03:00.520> making<00:03:00.730> a<00:03:01.510> cookie<00:03:01.840> jar

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:02.790 
thinking about making a cookie jar

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:07.380 
thinking about making a cookie jar
cookie<00:03:03.790> mix<00:03:04.000> two<00:03:04.420> to<00:03:04.780> pair<00:03:05.470> it<00:03:05.590> up<00:03:05.680> with<00:03:05.820> it<00:03:06.820> so

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:07.390 
cookie mix two to pair it up with it so

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:08.940 
cookie mix two to pair it up with it so
it'd<00:03:07.510> be<00:03:07.690> a<00:03:07.720> really<00:03:08.110> nice<00:03:08.350> gift<00:03:08.620> for<00:03:08.740> the

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:08.950 
it'd be a really nice gift for the

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:14.910 
it'd be a really nice gift for the
holidays<00:03:10.410> it<00:03:11.410> smells<00:03:11.860> really<00:03:11.950> good<00:03:13.920> we'll

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:14.920 
holidays it smells really good we'll

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:21.240 
holidays it smells really good we'll
just<00:03:15.180> put<00:03:16.180> it<00:03:16.269> all<00:03:16.390> in<00:03:16.420> there<00:03:19.950> and<00:03:20.950> make<00:03:21.220> sure

00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:21.250 
just put it all in there and make sure

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:24.870 
just put it all in there and make sure
that<00:03:22.000> you<00:03:22.150> store<00:03:22.450> these<00:03:22.750> bottles<00:03:23.260> in<00:03:23.680> a<00:03:24.370> dark

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:24.880 
that you store these bottles in a dark

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:28.110 
that you store these bottles in a dark
cupboard<00:03:25.239> or<00:03:26.110> if<00:03:26.890> you<00:03:27.010> even<00:03:27.160> have<00:03:27.400> a<00:03:27.430> darker

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:28.120 
cupboard or if you even have a darker

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:31.050 
cupboard or if you even have a darker
bottle<00:03:28.510> like<00:03:28.780> an<00:03:28.900> Amber<00:03:29.320> bottle<00:03:30.070> would<00:03:30.700> even

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:31.060 
bottle like an Amber bottle would even

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:32.580 
bottle like an Amber bottle would even
be<00:03:31.150> better<00:03:31.360> but<00:03:31.540> you<00:03:31.630> just<00:03:31.780> want<00:03:32.080> to<00:03:32.170> expose

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:32.590 
be better but you just want to expose

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:35.490 
be better but you just want to expose
this<00:03:33.459> to<00:03:33.700> light<00:03:33.910> so<00:03:34.360> that<00:03:34.660> the<00:03:34.840> vanilla<00:03:35.200> does

00:03:35.490 --> 00:03:35.500 
this to light so that the vanilla does

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:40.440 
this to light so that the vanilla does
not<00:03:35.680> break<00:03:35.860> down<00:03:37.620> and<00:03:38.970> make<00:03:39.970> sure<00:03:40.150> that<00:03:40.300> you

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:40.450 
not break down and make sure that you

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:44.490 
not break down and make sure that you
are<00:03:40.570> using<00:03:40.840> 80<00:03:41.470> proof<00:03:41.830> vodka<00:03:42.550> I<00:03:43.350> guess<00:03:44.350> the

00:03:44.490 --> 00:03:44.500 
are using 80 proof vodka I guess the

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:49.259 
are using 80 proof vodka I guess the
winter<00:03:44.680> red<00:03:44.980> it<00:03:45.250> works<00:03:45.640> best<00:03:47.790> so<00:03:48.790> you<00:03:48.880> just

00:03:49.259 --> 00:03:49.269 
winter red it works best so you just

00:03:49.269 --> 00:03:52.949 
winter red it works best so you just
kind<00:03:49.959> of<00:03:50.050> cut<00:03:50.590> them<00:03:50.680> up<00:03:50.890> there<00:03:51.220> I<00:03:51.640> was<00:03:52.600> going<00:03:52.780> to

00:03:52.949 --> 00:03:52.959 
kind of cut them up there I was going to

00:03:52.959 --> 00:03:54.479 
kind of cut them up there I was going to
split<00:03:53.200> them<00:03:53.410> in<00:03:53.500> half<00:03:53.530> but<00:03:53.920> you<00:03:54.040> know<00:03:54.190> what<00:03:54.400> and

00:03:54.479 --> 00:03:54.489 
split them in half but you know what and

00:03:54.489 --> 00:03:56.430 
split them in half but you know what and
scrape<00:03:54.790> off<00:03:54.910> the<00:03:54.970> UM<00:03:55.300> the<00:03:55.540> beans<00:03:55.750> the<00:03:55.959> caviar

00:03:56.430 --> 00:03:56.440 
scrape off the UM the beans the caviar

00:03:56.440 --> 00:03:58.740 
scrape off the UM the beans the caviar
but<00:03:56.739> that's<00:03:57.100> gonna<00:03:57.310> be<00:03:57.400> time-consuming<00:03:57.880> and

00:03:58.740 --> 00:03:58.750 
but that's gonna be time-consuming and

00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:00.990 
but that's gonna be time-consuming and
you<00:03:58.900> don't<00:03:59.050> need<00:03:59.110> to<00:03:59.230> do<00:03:59.350> that<00:03:59.380> since<00:04:00.000> the

00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:01.000 
you don't need to do that since the

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.020 
you don't need to do that since the
beans<00:04:01.239> will<00:04:01.420> just<00:04:01.660> soak<00:04:01.840> in<00:04:02.050> there<00:04:02.200> anyway<00:04:02.590> and

00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:03.030 
beans will just soak in there anyway and

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:06.570 
beans will just soak in there anyway and
you<00:04:04.030> know<00:04:04.150> pretty<00:04:04.330> much<00:04:04.420> marinate<00:04:04.959> so<00:04:05.580> there's

00:04:06.570 --> 00:04:06.580 
you know pretty much marinate so there's

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:11.880 
you know pretty much marinate so there's
no<00:04:06.730> need<00:04:06.880> to<00:04:06.910> be<00:04:07.780> splitting<00:04:08.140> it<00:04:08.200> in<00:04:08.320> half<00:04:10.890> it

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:11.890 
no need to be splitting it in half it

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:22.340 
no need to be splitting it in half it
all<00:04:12.870> come<00:04:13.870> out<00:04:13.959> the<00:04:14.019> same

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:22.350 

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:40.280 

so<00:04:23.350> almost<00:04:24.100> done<00:04:24.310> here<00:04:31.199> okay

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:40.290 

00:04:40.290 --> 00:04:46.770 

what's<00:04:41.290> that<00:04:41.440> hmm<00:04:43.229> there<00:04:44.229> we<00:04:44.380> go<00:04:44.850> so<00:04:45.850> I<00:04:45.910> think<00:04:46.600> I
