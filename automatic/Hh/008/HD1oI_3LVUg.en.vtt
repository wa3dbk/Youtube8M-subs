00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:16.500
 hi to all and lease no case in this 

00:00:15.510 --> 00:00:18.060
 video today we find ourselves for 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:20.100
 a new information really very 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:21.270
 very important so remember there are 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:23.550
 a few days I made you a video 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:24.869
 information concerning which 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:26.070
 fashionable vehicles and how would there be 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:27.810
 a big wave of ban 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:29.189
 some people do not go raw 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:30.119
 some people thought it was 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:32.460
 a video for the buzz 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:34.020
 or while I just wanted to have fun 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:34.440
 sell fashion vehicles and 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:37.140
 players 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:39.090
 anything and so yesterday window of 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:41.190
 lift two friends a message on twitter 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:42.600
 to say that there was a 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:44.880
 new not a new update 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:46.950
 but a new feature actually 

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:49.230
 that rockstar had set up and in 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:51.150
 did it used to do is this a scan 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:52.890
 of our garages to find out which players 

00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:54.870
 had fashion vehicles and so of 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:56.310
 rockstar shot scan all the garages for 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:58.650
 to know who is the deco dissolved 

00:00:56.310 --> 00:01:00.420
 then there the galore space mountain and 

00:00:58.650 --> 00:01:02.430
 Then they play with the players 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:03.810
 so very very careful this is 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:04.290
 it's really a video for you 

00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:05.850
 to warn 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:07.200
 either you keep them in fact that 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:08.820
 your head and you take the risks 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:10.439
 either you delete them and you are 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:12.540
 quiet I really have a lot 

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:14.400
 people who had to delete all 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:16.079
 vehicles before by memories they have 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:17.130
 took a small picture but they did not 

00:01:16.079 --> 00:01:18.210
 wanted to take the risk is 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:20.400
 frankly I advise you the same 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:22.050
 so for people who would try 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:22.409
 who would try anyway 

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:24.900
 keep 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:27.180
 attention he has a ban at the key so the 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:28.800
 vans and 14 days if it's your first 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:30.450
 time and if it's not the first time 

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:32.190
 it will be a ban of a month so 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:34.080
 frankly really is careful for 

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:36.150
 a vehicle saying no or not 

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:37.650
 necessarily how to say who is 

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:39.780
 interesting who is beautiful he is 

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:41.159
 stylish but is not he is not 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:42.920
 indispensable see what I mean 

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:45.060
 so really makes the right choice 

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:46.380
 and so we come to the end of 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:48.000
 this warning video again a 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:49.229

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:49.620
 want some people to be done 

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:51.600
 ban 

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:52.740

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:54.120

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:56.159
