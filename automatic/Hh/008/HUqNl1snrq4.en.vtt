seats<00:02:16.250> and<00:02:16.490> this<00:02:17.240> is<00:02:18.010> the<00:02:19.010> glide<00:02:19.280> see<00:02:20.020> which

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:21.020 
seats and this is the glide see which

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:22.270 
seats and this is the glide see which
enables<00:02:21.440> kind<00:02:21.620> of<00:02:21.680> traverse<00:02:21.980> greater

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:22.280 
enables kind of traverse greater

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:25.300 
enables kind of traverse greater
distances<00:02:23.470> and<00:02:24.470> I<00:02:24.620> can<00:02:24.770> switch<00:02:24.950> it<00:02:24.980> build<00:02:25.220> this

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:25.310 
distances and I can switch it build this

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:28.330 
distances and I can switch it build this
bridge<00:02:26.410> of<00:02:27.410> course<00:02:27.650> it's<00:02:27.800> a<00:02:27.830> lego<00:02:27.980> games<00:02:28.190> and

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:28.340 
bridge of course it's a lego games and

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:29.590 
bridge of course it's a lego games and
can<00:02:28.460> be<00:02:28.490> lots<00:02:28.640> of<00:02:28.760> things<00:02:28.940> to<00:02:29.000> mess<00:02:29.150> around<00:02:29.270> and

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:29.600 
can be lots of things to mess around and

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:32.680 
can be lots of things to mess around and
lots<00:02:29.810> of<00:02:30.020> things<00:02:31.270> excuse<00:02:32.270> me<00:02:32.390> lots<00:02:32.570> of<00:02:32.630> things
