00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:10.460
 and what happens half trocar the tools 

00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:12.139
 welcome to a new video for 

00:00:10.460 --> 00:00:14.660
 the channel and good guys today I bring you my 

00:00:12.139 --> 00:00:17.030
 first game recorded here to be able 

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:19.130
 upload it to the more call of duty channel 

00:00:17.030 --> 00:00:20.720
 advances warfare is obviously not the 

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:22.520
 first thing I've done because good if 

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:25.490
 I would teach you the first mother of mine 

00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:27.470
 my mother that beatings that gave me the 

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:29.630
 truth is that as he was saying in the 

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:32.270
 previous video that explains a little bit 

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:35.360
 the menus and others tell you that they have 

00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:36.600
 Trapping or is there a lot Campero the 

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:40.370
 truth is that no 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:44.510
 It is not good but good 

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:44.510
 but it is true that it is also true 

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:51.780
 I know that I am not a maxim for the 

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:54.299
 style let's go I would like at least 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:56.670
 learn to play that way but good 

00:00:54.299 --> 00:00:58.680
 try to do it as I can and here 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:01.559
 Well the truth is that a lot 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:04.140
 decent is a 28 in this round of 

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:06.090
 domain the truth is that domain is the 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:09.030
 egg or the way as until now that more 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:11.149
 I liked it, I can not complain about 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:13.590
 this game mode it is true that 

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:15.600
 in other types of game modes it has not been 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:18.420
 noticed more camper ism as for example 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:21.090
 could only by teams or good we see already 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:23.460
 if we talk about confirmed low is already 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:25.649
 exaggerated the level of camper ism 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:28.259
 that I found in those game modes 

00:01:25.649 --> 00:01:29.130
 in this the truth is that well, yes 

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:30.840
 that it is true that being a little 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:33.659
 changing some on the flags and 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:35.459
 other but good is not something very 

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:36.390
 exaggerated here at least you can 

00:01:35.459 --> 00:01:38.070
 fairly 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:39.870
 Well, I've found some 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:42.720
 games in which people went to 

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:44.430
 play not to change and hide but 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:46.110
 well it's pretty good and good as it is 

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:48.300
 I was commenting on the previous video myself 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:50.520
 I return here and here to emphasize here I am 

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:52.530
 with the weapon that told you the vall that 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:55.520
 is very very good this weapon I like 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:58.890
 quite that it has a good cadence 

00:01:55.520 --> 00:02:00.509
 does a good damage the truth I like yes 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:04.229
 It's true that I still do not have it very 

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:06.210
 improved to put that does not have as much 

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:08.009
 recoil and others but yes that is true 

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:10.289
 that this weapon is pretty good 

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:12.870
 distance is lethal and long distance 

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:15.750
 Well yes we can also say that it is 

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:18.260
 pretty good so very long 

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:18.260
 distance 

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:25.080
 but well we do it and go 

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:27.750
 pretty good and one thing so I can 

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:30.090
 say that I did not like it very much 

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:31.860
 this has not finished convince me is 

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:33.930
 that we have very little ammunition the truth 

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:35.489
 is that there is very little evolution to fix 

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:38.489
 here like this one was using the 

00:02:35.489 --> 00:02:39.810
 ability of the exoskeleton shield and 

00:02:38.489 --> 00:02:42.110
 well what is saying that there is no 

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:44.420
 a lot of ammunition and the truth that 

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:46.700
 a bit of a bitch basically 

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:49.580
 We are starting and other things as soon as 

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:52.520
 we just run out right away so we 

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:55.750
 it's time to go pulling the crumbs that goes 

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:55.750
 leaving people on the ground 

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:02.900
 there is something I do not know exactly at what level 

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:05.030
 concrete but on the burst it is 

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:06.980
 unlocks that is until 30 and something 

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:09.409
 we can not have 

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:12.739
 extra to go to take the position of 

00:03:09.409 --> 00:03:16.340
 ground but good the truth is that it is 

00:03:12.739 --> 00:03:18.980
 pretty good the game already here to me the 

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:21.110
 I really like it, I do not know 

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:22.640
 you who tell me to leave me in the 

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:25.849
 comments know what opinion do you have 

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:27.980
 about if you like and other games but 

00:03:25.849 --> 00:03:29.629
 you could have tried to prove or those that 

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:31.489
 Well, what you have seen 

00:03:29.629 --> 00:03:33.129
 videos and others you can let me see that 

00:03:31.489 --> 00:03:35.720
 your comments that I think that 

00:03:33.129 --> 00:03:38.420
 you could new come would remove is that not 

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:40.459
 you like it well obviously, well, 

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:42.920
 Can you give me a little more opinion 

00:03:40.459 --> 00:03:45.200
 as I would say more specific more specific 

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:47.060
 since you have tried it and good but yes 

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:49.069
 It's true that I like it a lot 

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:50.780
 it's like the black ops that you have to leave 

00:03:49.069 --> 00:03:52.700
 a loader practically kill 

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:56.239
 someone here the truth is that neither 

00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:58.280
 it reaches the point of the forest because you 

00:03:56.239 --> 00:04:00.260
 bancÃ¡s and you died here the truth is that 

00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:02.080
 It is in between fairly 

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:04.970
 good 

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:07.670
 people in the corners is that 

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:10.040
 it's an exaggerated thing but good and 

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:11.900
 how was this game commented 

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:14.150
 pretty good here we have the vall that 

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:17.239
 I have it with a crosshair I have put 

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:18.570
 also what is and also used 

00:04:17.239 --> 00:04:20.760
 a new 

00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:22.920
 a new a new accessory that they have 

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:25.290
 post is called microphone or something like that if 

00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:27.090
 I'm not wrong and it's good to hear 

00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:28.620
 so that they come out concretely the 

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:30.810
 shots they make when someone 

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:32.880
 shoot with a silencer that appears 

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:35.090
 also on the radar if you're in the area 

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:36.830
 the truth is that that's pretty 

00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:40.020
 obviously for the one they have silenced 

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:41.490
 it's also a bitch but it's good 

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:44.070
 it's pretty good it 's pretty of 

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:45.420
 interesting accessories like 

00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:48.750
 as for example they are what are the 

00:04:45.420 --> 00:04:51.570
 Streaks are also not so 

00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:54.780
 exaggerated the plan as for example the 

00:04:51.570 --> 00:04:57.240
 skinny 2 that we had the swarm and others 

00:04:54.780 --> 00:04:58.650
 here's a good bit more moderate 

00:04:57.240 --> 00:05:01.140
 at least the ones I've been seeing 

00:04:58.650 --> 00:05:03.330
 I have not seen the whole issue of 

00:05:01.140 --> 00:05:04.530
 knife I like it a lot but yes 

00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:06.630
 it is true that there is ever a time 

00:05:04.530 --> 00:05:08.920
 bit false in that I do not know sometimes 

00:05:06.630 --> 00:05:13.230
 to blades someone alhaurino 

00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:13.230
 it's a thing of 4 

00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:18.510
 that there was a game of weapons or so 

00:05:17.010 --> 00:05:22.590
 except I did not find it until now 

00:05:18.510 --> 00:05:24.090
 I do not know in what way is the game I do 

00:05:22.590 --> 00:05:26.340
 I had heard that they were going to put 

00:05:24.090 --> 00:05:28.140
 safe escape but good 

00:05:26.340 --> 00:05:33.090
 investigate a little bit more, I'm not saying no 

00:05:28.140 --> 00:05:35.190
 nothing is simply that drew me 

00:05:33.090 --> 00:05:36.630
 a turret the truth is that there are 

00:05:35.190 --> 00:05:38.190
 turrets also because you can 

00:05:36.630 --> 00:05:41.760
 use as I have told you what it is 

00:05:38.190 --> 00:05:43.710
 We can use them remotely as 

00:05:41.760 --> 00:05:45.780
 in other call of duty and good 

00:05:43.710 --> 00:05:47.700
 just those guys in this game 

00:05:45.780 --> 00:05:50.070
 and remind you of a very important thing and 

00:05:47.700 --> 00:05:52.020
 is that I'm going to do a live show this afternoon 

00:05:50.070 --> 00:05:54.300
 completely today I'm going to make a 

00:05:52.020 --> 00:05:55.890
 direct on youtube and maybe do my 

00:05:54.300 --> 00:05:57.960
 half of live on youtube and the other 

00:05:55.890 --> 00:05:59.280
 half in tweets and so good then yes 

00:05:57.960 --> 00:06:02.640
 you want to see a bit how the game goes 

00:05:59.280 --> 00:06:06.510
 is to try to imitate some youtubers and 

00:06:02.640 --> 00:06:08.580
 also so you can and well then if 

00:06:06.510 --> 00:06:10.790
 some of you have the play 

00:06:08.580 --> 00:06:10.790
 four 

00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:16.379
 I'm also going to try to create a 

00:06:13.979 --> 00:06:18.599
 plan since I've seen a way to plans 

00:06:16.379 --> 00:06:20.909
 so I'm going to see how the theme works 

00:06:18.599 --> 00:06:23.009
 of the cne and well then when you know more or 

00:06:20.909 --> 00:06:26.249
 less how it works then we can do 

00:06:23.009 --> 00:06:27.990
 a plan for the channel so we can 

00:06:26.249 --> 00:06:29.759
 play and more the truth that as I say no 

00:06:27.990 --> 00:06:31.770
 I have a lot of idea of how many people 

00:06:29.759 --> 00:06:33.930
 can defend the plan I do not know if it's like 

00:06:31.770 --> 00:06:35.249
 a kind of crew like ingenia do not 

00:06:33.930 --> 00:06:36.930
 I know I have to investigate a little 

00:06:35.249 --> 00:06:38.969
 about it and good guys 

00:06:36.930 --> 00:06:40.889
 simply that I will do a directive not 

00:06:38.969 --> 00:06:41.909
 I have the specific time or nothing or 

00:06:40.889 --> 00:06:44.460
 I'm not going to make an informative video 

00:06:41.909 --> 00:06:47.310
 what time I'll do nothing as 

00:06:44.460 --> 00:06:50.340
 Probably it was done in the afternoon 

00:06:47.310 --> 00:06:51.810
 I do not know exactly what time but good 

00:06:50.340 --> 00:06:53.879
 all ways if you enter the channel and 

00:06:51.810 --> 00:06:55.469
 you are attentive and you see that I am in 

00:06:53.879 --> 00:06:58.110
 direct since you know you go there 

00:06:55.469 --> 00:06:59.370
 and so on and if it did anyway 

00:06:58.110 --> 00:07:01.680
 by tweets that I still have not clear 

00:06:59.370 --> 00:07:02.909
 because I'm going to see everything if I 

00:07:01.680 --> 00:07:04.800
 do by tweets on our mobile 

00:07:02.909 --> 00:07:07.139
 Serve twitter if you follow me on twitter 

00:07:04.800 --> 00:07:09.270
 and so on the moment you start a 

00:07:07.139 --> 00:07:10.830
 direct by tweets jump jumps a 

00:07:09.270 --> 00:07:12.210
 message on twitter well what 

00:07:10.830 --> 00:07:13.589
 I'm doing the direct and others was 

00:07:12.210 --> 00:07:15.150
 if you follow me on twitter why 

00:07:13.589 --> 00:07:15.990
 you wait quickly if I am doing 

00:07:15.150 --> 00:07:17.670
 the direct one 

00:07:15.990 --> 00:07:19.170
 and nothing more kids just that if you 

00:07:17.670 --> 00:07:20.670
 liked oil videos there are favorites 

00:07:19.170 --> 00:07:22.290
 subscribe to which national you are we 

00:07:20.670 --> 00:07:25.520

 guys and goodbye
