00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.089
 and 

00:00:03.660 --> 00:00:11.190
 Hello everyone, welcome to a new 

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:14.219
 tutorial so in this case I'm going to 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:17.100
 teach how to configure our 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:18.840
 joystick to play in our 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:22.519
 Chinese people good basically what 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:22.519
 first thing we have to do is go 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:31.439
 home team let's go where we have 

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:34.140
 installed our fish tops 2014 or 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:36.210
 any version also serves to 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:39.040
 any good game what are we going to 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:44.200
 to do is look for the grammy portfolio 

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:46.540
 pro evolution settings we execute 

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:50.220
 as administrator 

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:54.950
 after this we wait for him to load 

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:54.950
 and we go to the next command option 

00:00:55.810 --> 00:01:00.330
 and you will seem them not to have 

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:03.250
 no good what they are going to do is 

00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:06.190
 select devices and search in 

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:12.150
 this case the generic as you can see 

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:12.150
 is me pressing the l2 

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:17.360
 or lte 

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:22.070
 and 

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:22.070
 has the action of the lb ol 

00:01:23.409 --> 00:01:28.859
 well what we do is the following 

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:28.859
 we select the button 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:34.940
 and we press the one that we are going to use in 

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:34.940
 this case 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:38.960
 the l2 

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:44.210
 and then we're going to set up the next 

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:46.620
 is the e1 

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:51.030
 weinberg 

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:54.720
 the button 7 button 5 on the and 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:59.450
 in total number 4 on the x button 

00:01:54.720 --> 00:02:02.430
 number 2 on the skin and so on 

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:04.580
 for example I'm pressing button 3 and 

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:07.350
 is working with the iv or square 

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:10.110
 then let's try the analogs are 

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:13.440
 all good and you may always have 

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:17.989
 This error is expelled by squeezing the 

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:22.709
 tighten stark select tighten select 

00:02:17.989 --> 00:02:24.940
 be good that would be basically what 

00:02:22.709 --> 00:02:28.540
 let's do that now 

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:30.130
 give ok would already be ready in the case of 

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:32.620
 that you will not one I will leave the 

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:34.090
 configuration the file 

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:35.840
 configuration in the link of the 

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:39.840
 inscription 

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:44.129
 to approve let's run our 

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:48.590
 but 2014 or the game that we have that already 

00:02:44.129 --> 00:02:48.590
 I would be ready to wait for him to run 

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:57.989
 in the pri clarify with much to you already 

00:02:52.170 --> 00:03:00.260
 of having the 2014 weight but with the 

00:02:57.989 --> 00:03:00.260
 Languages 

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:04.319
 in English with the language in English 

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:07.040
 only 

00:03:04.319 --> 00:03:07.040
 because 

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:15.430
 just come out in Spanish 

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:15.430
 either Spanish Spanish 

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:21.810
 let's then try to upload a 

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:21.810
 how to install tutorial 

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:29.230
 can you repeat all those winners so much 

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:34.190
 basically 

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:37.090
 that's going to cover the 2014 tutorials 

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:40.739
 let's take it a little 

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:40.739
 nor restoring much 

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:47.040
 good to see I have here the fish menu 

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:54.810
 I played my first game in which 

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:58.410
 lost 0-3 against Colombia 

00:03:54.810 --> 00:04:00.319
 well I show you the game more than anything 

00:03:58.410 --> 00:04:04.430
 only for 

00:04:00.319 --> 00:04:05.960
 all of this that does not come in the 

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:09.230
 game 

00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:12.200
 but download a file option on 

00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:14.020
 which only puts the name of the 

00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:15.990
 team 

00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:18.810
 and the logs 

00:04:15.990 --> 00:04:22.550
 Besides the wolves devour the 

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:22.550
 transfers are not made but 

00:04:23.389 --> 00:04:29.719
 when another profile comes out I'm going to 

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:32.240
 I will obviously download it to 

00:04:29.719 --> 00:04:36.050
 you so that they can prove it and if 

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:40.249
 they like the chelsea group and arsenal with 

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:42.880
 webber are not licensed 

00:04:40.249 --> 00:04:47.380

00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:49.900

00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:52.210

 in the event that you do not want 

00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:14.849
 Can you recommend exposure or what 

00:05:12.669 --> 00:05:18.059
