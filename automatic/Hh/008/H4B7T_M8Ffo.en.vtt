00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:56.210 
the front and pull the yarn out so I'm
working<00:00:53.540> backwards<00:00:54.650> taking<00:00:55.650> the<00:00:55.739> stitches

off the right hand needle onto the
left-hand<00:00:59.220> needle<00:01:00.229> but<00:01:01.229> the<00:01:01.350> way<00:01:01.470> to<00:01:01.530> do<00:01:01.830> it<00:01:02.010> is

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
left-hand needle but the way to do it is

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:04.939 
left-hand needle but the way to do it is
always<00:01:02.610> to<00:01:02.820> put<00:01:03.030> the<00:01:03.780> needle<00:01:04.260> in<00:01:04.379> from<00:01:04.799> the

always to put the needle in from the
front

00:01:06.609 --> 00:01:06.619 
front

00:01:06.619 --> 00:01:12.110 
front
now<00:01:07.619> if<00:01:07.920> you've<00:01:08.490> taken<00:01:09.180> the<00:01:09.619> work<00:01:10.619> off<00:01:11.120> the

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:12.120 
now if you've taken the work off the

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:15.050 
now if you've taken the work off the
needles<00:01:12.510> and<00:01:12.780> rip<00:01:13.680> back<00:01:13.950> several<00:01:14.280> rows<00:01:14.640> and

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
needles and rip back several rows and

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:16.970 
needles and rip back several rows and
you're<00:01:15.180> just<00:01:15.360> picking<00:01:15.720> them<00:01:15.810> back<00:01:16.020> up<00:01:16.230> you<00:01:16.950> can

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:16.980 
you're just picking them back up you can

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:19.910 
you're just picking them back up you can
finally<00:01:17.490> find<00:01:18.140> that<00:01:19.140> you've<00:01:19.290> picked<00:01:19.530> up<00:01:19.770> a

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
finally find that you've picked up a

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:22.040 
finally find that you've picked up a
stitch<00:01:20.250> and<00:01:20.640> you'll<00:01:21.120> come<00:01:21.360> to<00:01:21.390> knit<00:01:21.750> it<00:01:21.930> and

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:22.050 
stitch and you'll come to knit it and

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:24.590 
stitch and you'll come to knit it and
it'll<00:01:22.230> look<00:01:22.470> like<00:01:22.650> this<00:01:23.450> because<00:01:24.450> you've

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
it'll look like this because you've

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:27.770 
it'll look like this because you've
twisted<00:01:24.900> it<00:01:25.350> and<00:01:26.220> the<00:01:26.970> important<00:01:27.450> thing<00:01:27.660> to

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
twisted it and the important thing to

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:30.080 
twisted it and the important thing to
remember<00:01:27.870> here<00:01:28.230> is<00:01:28.500> to<00:01:28.860> twist<00:01:29.370> it<00:01:29.640> back<00:01:29.850> the

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
remember here is to twist it back the

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:30.560 
remember here is to twist it back the
right<00:01:30.240> way

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570 
right way

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:33.110 
right way
so<00:01:31.290> rather<00:01:31.530> than<00:01:31.710> knitting<00:01:32.040> it<00:01:32.310> in<00:01:32.520> the<00:01:32.760> normal

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:33.120 
so rather than knitting it in the normal

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:36.110 
so rather than knitting it in the normal
way<00:01:33.300> like<00:01:33.900> that<00:01:34.170> you<00:01:34.950> want<00:01:35.130> to<00:01:35.190> knit<00:01:35.520> through

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:36.120 
way like that you want to knit through

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:40.399 
way like that you want to knit through
the<00:01:36.150> back<00:01:36.270> of<00:01:36.659> it<00:01:37.430> to<00:01:38.430> keep<00:01:38.640> it<00:01:38.909> nice<00:01:39.409> but

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:40.409 
the back of it to keep it nice but

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:43.330 
the back of it to keep it nice but
usually<00:01:41.010> if<00:01:41.220> you're<00:01:41.340> just<00:01:41.610> taking<00:01:41.970> your<00:01:42.290> stick

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:43.340 
usually if you're just taking your stick

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:45.830 
usually if you're just taking your stick
taking<00:01:44.340> your<00:01:44.460> knitting<00:01:44.790> back<00:01:45.030> one<00:01:45.360> stitch<00:01:45.659> at

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
taking your knitting back one stitch at

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:49.610 
taking your knitting back one stitch at
a<00:01:45.930> time<00:01:47.120> then<00:01:48.120> they<00:01:48.630> will<00:01:48.810> all<00:01:48.900> line<00:01:49.140> up<00:01:49.170> nicely

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:49.620 
a time then they will all line up nicely

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:51.890 
a time then they will all line up nicely
as<00:01:50.460> long<00:01:50.670> as<00:01:50.790> you've<00:01:50.909> gone<00:01:51.060> in<00:01:51.240> from<00:01:51.479> the<00:01:51.630> front

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:51.900 
as long as you've gone in from the front

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:57.170 
as long as you've gone in from the front
as<00:01:52.229> you<00:01:53.100> put<00:01:53.340> it<00:01:53.460> onto<00:01:53.640> the<00:01:53.790> other<00:01:53.909> needle<00:01:56.180> now

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:57.180 
as you put it onto the other needle now

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:00.050 
as you put it onto the other needle now
let<00:01:57.690> me<00:01:57.780> show<00:01:57.930> you<00:01:57.960> how<00:01:58.170> to<00:01:58.200> undo<00:01:58.710> pearls<00:01:59.070> let's

assume we want to unknit the pearls let

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:05.660 
assume we want to unknit the pearls let
me<00:02:05.159> think

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:05.670 
me think

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:08.539 
me think
that'll<00:02:06.240> be<00:02:06.330> her<00:02:06.750> up<00:02:06.930> that<00:02:07.260> doesn't<00:02:08.190> sound<00:02:08.310> so

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:08.549 
that'll be her up that doesn't sound so

00:02:08.549 --> 00:02:11.690 
that'll be her up that doesn't sound so
good<00:02:08.580> as<00:02:08.789> tink<00:02:09.090> does<00:02:09.390> it<00:02:09.509> now<00:02:10.409> to<00:02:10.950> undo<00:02:11.310> a<00:02:11.340> purl

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:11.700 
good as tink does it now to undo a purl

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:14.270 
good as tink does it now to undo a purl
you<00:02:12.269> do<00:02:12.420> the<00:02:12.540> same<00:02:12.810> thing<00:02:13.200> you<00:02:13.830> put<00:02:14.040> the<00:02:14.159> needle

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:14.280 
you do the same thing you put the needle

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:18.290 
you do the same thing you put the needle
in<00:02:14.549> from<00:02:14.819> the<00:02:14.940> front<00:02:16.010> and<00:02:17.010> pull<00:02:17.280> it<00:02:17.370> off<00:02:17.520> like

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:18.300

that
so<00:02:19.659> exactly<00:02:19.959> the<00:02:20.260> same<00:02:20.440> as<00:02:20.590> with<00:02:20.739> the<00:02:20.890> nets<00:02:21.099> you

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:21.400 
so exactly the same as with the nets you

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:24.350 
so exactly the same as with the nets you
put<00:02:21.909> the<00:02:22.030> needle<00:02:22.150> end<00:02:22.480> to<00:02:22.810> the<00:02:22.930> stitch<00:02:23.200> below

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:24.360 
put the needle end to the stitch below

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:29.670 
put the needle end to the stitch below
drop<00:02:25.360> it<00:02:25.540> off<00:02:25.690> and<00:02:26.290> pull<00:02:26.680> the<00:02:26.709> yarn<00:02:26.980> out<00:02:28.680> okay

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:29.680 
drop it off and pull the yarn out okay

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:31.470 
drop it off and pull the yarn out okay
so<00:02:30.280> it<00:02:30.370> doesn't<00:02:30.459> matter<00:02:30.790> whether<00:02:31.030> it's<00:02:31.239> a<00:02:31.299> knit

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:31.480 
so it doesn't matter whether it's a knit

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:33.930 
so it doesn't matter whether it's a knit
stitch<00:02:31.629> or<00:02:31.959> a<00:02:31.989> purl<00:02:32.260> stitch<00:02:32.370> to<00:02:33.370> take<00:02:33.580> it<00:02:33.760> back

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:33.940

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:39.569 
stitch or a purl stitch to take it back
one<00:02:34.269> at<00:02:34.420> a<00:02:34.450> time<00:02:34.750> really<00:02:35.500> close<00:02:36.150> closely<00:02:38.579> to

00:02:39.569 --> 00:02:39.579 
one at a time really close closely to

00:02:39.579 --> 00:02:41.460
