 hello and happy to greet you on 

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:14.030
 course stove pier 5 css3 

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:16.410
 lesson theme transformation &amp; animation 

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:18.060
 very often to do 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:20.760
 user interface more 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:22.890
 pleasant and lively designers add 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:25.350
 animation to individual elements 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:26.510
 controls add animated 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:29.310
 menu items 

00:00:26.510 --> 00:00:32.189
 special mouse hover effects 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:33.770
 smooth parts of the document 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:37.950
 page transitions 

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:41.399
 the animation greatly changes the sensations from 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:44.070
 use the application earlier in order 

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:45.840
 to add an animated effect to 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:47.180
 the document we had to use 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:51.050
 what's the script code 

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:53.550
 that is, using javascript code we 

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:57.059
 controlled as separate properties 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:59.280
 change their value in java time 

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:01.649
 script code controlled object transition 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:04.860
 anybody some element in the document 

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:07.020
 transition his state from one to another 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:09.720
 let's say a gradual increase in height there and 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:12.659
 width main son smooth change of light 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:15.210
 element and so on before us 

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:18.000
 it was necessary to use the java script 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:19.920
 animation code now with css 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:24.000
 3 to animate 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:26.790
 element we need to create multiple 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.979
 rules and have these rules using 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:32.189
 special property to set how 

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:34.950
 the element will change its properties in 

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:37.590
 time as he will be animated on 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:39.869
 In this lesson we will look at some of you. 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:42.930
 properties exist in css third for 

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:44.509
 order to create an animation and consider 

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:47.340
 what functions 

00:01:44.509 --> 00:01:49.540
 allowing to transform into a state 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:51.890
 element transform element 

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:56.290
 in three-dimensional or two-dimensional space 

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:56.290
 what functions can we use 

00:01:56.979 --> 00:02:01.940
 the easiest way to create an animation 

00:01:59.479 --> 00:02:05.720
 take advantage of the transitions 

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:08.330
 or see any transitions tranzishen 

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:10.550
 supports 78 percent of modern 

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:13.190
 browsers first examples which we 

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:15.850
 Now let's analyze demonstrate how 

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:21.050
 transitions can be animated 

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:23.440
 elements of the document let's first we 

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:28.100
 run the example and see how it works 

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:30.790
 example you see what's originally on 

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:33.530
 page is an item 

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:35.450
 circled if we are pointing tower 

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:37.880
 on this element then it increases its 

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:40.480
 size if the mouse is out of bounds 

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:43.370
 item size returns to 

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:48.170
 we have the previous now 

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:50.660
 transition from the value of the width of the element 300 

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:52.720
 pixels to the width of elements 

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:56.299
 let's say 400 pixels 

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:58.610
 it turns out that in order to change 

00:02:56.299 --> 00:03:00.860
 thus the condition of the item us 

00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:03.019
 need some object that will 

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:06.470
 control just like Thai width 

00:03:03.019 --> 00:03:08.110
 varies in time from this value to 

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:10.340
 new value that we need 

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:11.989
 the easiest way to create such 

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:14.470
 animation is use transition 

00:03:11.989 --> 00:03:14.470
 transient 

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:22.150
 see how the example looks like we create 

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:24.819
 the div element is specified for divo 

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:28.030
 the default setting we specify the frame 

00:03:24.819 --> 00:03:31.180
 n dengue indents and initial width 

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:34.540
 diva 300 pixels we want so when 

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:38.110
 mouseover div increased its 

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:40.750
 widths from 300 to 500 made it 

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:42.250
 smoothly not jerk like we do it 

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:45.790
 usually without animation 

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:48.790
 and smoothly increased the size of the width starting 

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:51.760
 with 300 and so on then to ask 

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:54.190
 smooth increase in width on line 20 

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:57.209
 property transits are created we 

00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:59.950
 specify what will happen 

00:03:57.209 --> 00:04:03.970
 smooth change of the it with property 

00:03:59.950 --> 00:04:07.390
 for two seconds if the property view 

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:10.000
 somewhere in the css code or in the java script 

00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:12.360
 code is changed it will be given 

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:14.950
 new browser value automatically 

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:17.949
 will calculate both in two seconds 

00:04:14.950 --> 00:04:20.829
 you can smoothly change property values 

00:04:17.949 --> 00:04:23.320
 view from current value to new 

00:04:20.829 --> 00:04:24.789
 which was set to not 

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:28.120
 create no extra 

00:04:24.789 --> 00:04:30.820
 scripts in the java script we specify 

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:33.550
 that when you hover the mouse over an item 

00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:36.970
 one we have the width of the element should 

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:39.010
 become 500 pixels and here it turns out 25 

00:04:36.970 --> 00:04:41.950
 the string is the moment of launch 

00:04:39.010 --> 00:04:43.810
 animations on line 20 we said to 

00:04:41.950 --> 00:04:47.050
 we will animate the view properties for 

00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:49.360
 two seconds at a construction site 25 we are animation 

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:51.870
 launched here and it turns out that if we 

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:54.700
 mouse over the element 

00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:57.099
 above element smoothly increases size 

00:04:54.700 --> 00:04:59.020
 mouse goes beyond element 

00:04:57.099 --> 00:05:01.979
 returns to your original 

00:04:59.020 --> 00:05:01.979
 condition 

00:05:02.510 --> 00:05:08.390
 this is the easiest way to set animation 

00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:11.060
 can also be animated 

00:05:08.390 --> 00:05:13.180
 simultaneously several properties let's 

00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:17.330
 Let's see what the second example looks like. 

00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:19.910
 when we mouse over the element we 

00:05:17.330 --> 00:05:23.770
 increasing element size changes 

00:05:19.910 --> 00:05:23.770
 its background and font color changes 

00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:35.500
 in order to set such an animation here 

00:05:32.199 --> 00:05:38.770
 our def on 2 waits and the line is initially 

00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:41.580
 its settings are from 7 to 13 line 

00:05:38.770 --> 00:05:44.490
 but settings 17 we indicate that to us 

00:05:41.580 --> 00:05:46.990
 we need to be a shift 

00:05:44.490 --> 00:05:48.699
 the value of the color property should change 

00:05:46.990 --> 00:05:51.580
 at 4 for four seconds 

00:05:48.699 --> 00:05:53.680
 view properties for four seconds and 

00:05:51.580 --> 00:05:55.479
 properties backgroundcolor these three 

00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:58.810
 properties we're going to animate 

00:05:55.479 --> 00:06:01.120
 so if somewhere in the current css 

00:05:58.810 --> 00:06:04.270
 document in the current rules will 

00:06:01.120 --> 00:06:06.190
 defined rules that change one 

00:06:04.270 --> 00:06:08.229
 of these properties either changes them 

00:06:06.190 --> 00:06:10.930
 at the same time the browser will start to run 

00:06:08.229 --> 00:06:14.050
 animation for 4 seconds of 

00:06:10.930 --> 00:06:14.949
 values to smoothly change value 

00:06:14.050 --> 00:06:17.560
 required properties 

00:06:14.949 --> 00:06:21.250
 well, we run an animation on 

00:06:17.560 --> 00:06:23.740
 line 20 when cn rules work 

00:06:21.250 --> 00:06:26.409
 sevda hovar class we change color 

00:06:23.740 --> 00:06:28.020
 the width and background of the element respectively 

00:06:26.409 --> 00:06:31.000
 browser true calculation smoothly 

00:06:28.020 --> 00:06:32.250
 calculates the change of all these properties for 

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:35.860
 of our item 

00:06:32.250 --> 00:06:37.479
 but if there are too many properties 

00:06:35.860 --> 00:06:39.780
 white which we are going to animate 

00:06:37.479 --> 00:06:42.780
 you can use this 

00:06:39.780 --> 00:06:42.780
 by approach 

00:06:46.790 --> 00:06:53.410
 In this example, you see what changes are not 

00:06:48.890 --> 00:06:56.090
 only width but also height and color and background 

00:06:53.410 --> 00:06:58.250
 background color text element color 

00:06:56.090 --> 00:06:59.480
 it turns out that we are animating as 

00:06:58.250 --> 00:07:00.980
 minimum four properties 

00:06:59.480 --> 00:07:04.570
 Well, the number of properties that we 

00:07:00.980 --> 00:07:04.570
 animating can be much more 

00:07:04.750 --> 00:07:10.220
 now on line 20 

00:07:07.100 --> 00:07:12.380
 indicates that the transition should be 

00:07:10.220 --> 00:07:15.590
 occur for any property which 

00:07:12.380 --> 00:07:17.270
 supports css animation and transition 

00:07:15.590 --> 00:07:19.820
 must occur within four 

00:07:17.270 --> 00:07:22.760
 seconds so if for the item 

00:07:19.820 --> 00:07:24.350
 about food 1 at least one of them is animating them 

00:07:22.760 --> 00:07:25.790
 properties from properties that can 

00:07:24.350 --> 00:07:27.830
 keep dumb 

00:07:25.790 --> 00:07:30.200
 at least one of the funds will change it 

00:07:27.830 --> 00:07:32.180
 property will change with application 

00:07:30.200 --> 00:07:34.130
 smooth transition over four 

00:07:32.180 --> 00:07:36.680
 seconds here we have three properties 

00:07:34.130 --> 00:07:38.960
 which we change color with heads and 

00:07:36.680 --> 00:07:42.670
 backgroundcolor and all these properties we have 

00:07:38.960 --> 00:07:42.670
 animates for four seconds 

00:07:44.710 --> 00:07:48.070
 we have now seen very simple settings 

00:07:46.810 --> 00:07:51.210
 transitive properties 

00:07:48.070 --> 00:07:54.370
 we essentially only specified properties and 

00:07:51.210 --> 00:07:56.940
 some more time will be 

00:07:54.370 --> 00:07:56.940
 animate
