00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.750
 of course it may sound strange that they say 

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:05.490
 gift because in a moment you 

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:07.529
 they ask you about the planned ones if any 

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:10.920
 instead, honey, did not do it in what 

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:13.049
 It happens that a man is very cold like 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:16.080
 pattern of all the men of the 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:18.270
 noble family are all very cold have 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:20.880
 a very strange character so to speak 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:23.609
 my father was always a very person 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:26.099
 new vertical is always by him never 

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:29.010
 he used emotions he always used a lot 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:31.710
 psychology and the mind a little more 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:34.710
 developed so saying it was very 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:36.750
 practical and logical I was not going by the side 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:38.460
 emotional 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:41.520
 like me 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:42.390
 because it's a gift because I 'll never 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:44.550
 I was afraid of him 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:46.710
 he always had a lot of respect but 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:49.890
 they would also always assume it was him 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:53.250
 for me he was not a sick father nor 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:55.739
 strange or crazy was a father out of what 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:57.989
 very smart common above all 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:01:00.120
 things and fifty not what's 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:01.620
 meeting of friends no no no no no 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:04.409
 girlfriend nothing from the bridge was a dad 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:06.300
 strange of a terrible character and in what 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:09.780
 moment stops being idyllic for you 

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:12.060
 animal that is is cut off from 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:13.710
 playful movie as vital regulation is 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:16.380
 that when you start to grow and you 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:18.869
 begins to realize the reality that 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:21.149
 You have to go living there and you realize 

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:23.640
 that is not idyllic but there are other 

00:01:21.149 --> 00:01:26.340
 jars that your father does not have to have 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:29.179
 a strange character not that your father is 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:32.280
 a person who has some disorder 

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:34.380
 different this what images do you have of 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:37.440
 this child that is growing since 8 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:40.140
 up to 14 15 years that you remember 

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:42.030
 that bring you into the patient reality 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:44.939
 this image that you do not share of your 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:45.860
 father there are many as many good as 

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:48.930
 bad 

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:50.300
 for example clear when you look at guys 

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:52.340
 parents 

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:54.560
 had like a game guy with 

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:57.410
 us that was a dynamo of 

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:58.790
 electricity then we placed the 

00:01:57.410 --> 00:02:00.920
 dynamo cables and he gave us 

00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:02.210
 electricity then that was up 

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:04.810
 when we could hold on 

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:07.370
 soon the big heavy loads and it was 

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:10.010
 strange then that for me it was not 

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:11.630
 normal but I did not take it as that 

00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:13.340
 He wanted to hurt me because it was not the 

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:15.230
 connotation but we always 

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:17.900
 placed by age but in ways 

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:19.730
 very strong, so to speak, something 

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:22.220
 that you asked me about the box 

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:24.590
 security that now of greater you would say 

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:26.810
 other walt electrocuted not under any 

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:29.150
 post I think dad was his way to 

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:32.810
 we place ourselves in situations 

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:36.260
 extreme physical to see here endurance 

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:37.940
 we arrived and I can tell you that based 

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:39.470
 to all those things that happened as of 

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:42.560
 soon she is not enclosed in a box 

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:45.290
 security a giant voice that was placed 

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:47.000
 in the house before building the house there 

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:48.620
 locked in there to see more or less 

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.290
 how much could we stand to be inside 

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:53.000
 a safe is terrible because 

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:55.550
 the complete pressure is lost and remains 

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:57.400
 with a whistle from those in the ears a 

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:59.650
 shield and a darkness 

00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:02.379
 a little desperation all those 

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:05.019
 things that the CIA was how much it will hold 

00:03:02.379 --> 00:03:08.439
 we do not arrive for minutes or less but 

00:03:05.019 --> 00:03:11.470
 we arrived at minute 1 well not in any 

00:03:08.439 --> 00:03:14.700
 moment was the time to go out 

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:18.269
 as I was never never was you never felt 

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:20.859
 exposed to damage or something 

00:03:18.269 --> 00:03:23.200
 pathologically terrible of wanting to do 

00:03:20.859 --> 00:03:24.579
 suffer the tortured person you were not the 

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:27.159
 context was like a game of 

00:03:24.579 --> 00:03:31.260
 resistance those were the games of 

00:03:27.159 --> 00:03:31.260
 rules just if 

00:03:31.569 --> 00:03:36.510
 then of course I think now if you 

00:03:33.849 --> 00:03:39.999
 I do not remember a terrible trauma 

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:44.430
 what's up with life was like this you guys 

00:03:39.999 --> 00:03:47.859
 you grow up in an unconventional way 

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:49.989
 you have two options because that tends to 

00:03:47.859 --> 00:03:53.680
 be a trauma in your life or if you achieve 

00:03:49.989 --> 00:03:54.549
 understand why that happened was what 

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:55.930
 it was the purpose 

00:03:54.549 --> 00:03:57.540
 I never felt that he is a victim of 

00:03:55.930 --> 00:03:59.799
 team wanted to hurt us not never 

00:03:57.540 --> 00:04:03.549
 I have to understand psychology too 

00:03:59.799 --> 00:04:05.319
 why it was like that all of life and today 

00:04:03.549 --> 00:04:09.280
 in day I can tell you that I do not feel that 

00:04:05.319 --> 00:04:11.919
 it was torture or exposing ourselves to something there 

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:14.379
 something there is not a game is its way it 

00:04:11.919 --> 00:04:16.870
 you do not remember your future you remember to 

00:04:14.379 --> 00:04:20.410
 yourself as a child having suffered not 

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:22.780
 you were not going with alcohol guards is if you 

00:04:20.410 --> 00:04:24.940
 you gave a playful tint to study school 

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:29.650
 your dad was an extravagant person 

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:31.599
 the ex in five but it leaves more 

00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:33.910
 delinquent this between 8 and 14 

00:04:31.599 --> 00:04:36.370
 years the image that the little animal 

00:04:33.910 --> 00:04:38.219
 has in his parents such when he submitted 

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:42.520
 to these endurance games that do not 

00:04:38.219 --> 00:04:44.740
 how long does it last but it hides from 

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:47.379
 Navantia with a safe 

00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:48.939
 that's clear endurance game you 

00:04:47.379 --> 00:04:52.689
 I had asked in what minute do you go 

00:04:48.939 --> 00:04:54.129
 realizing that it is no longer a game but 

00:04:52.689 --> 00:04:56.680
 that your dad 

00:04:54.129 --> 00:04:58.960
 is not this person what happens is that 

00:04:56.680 --> 00:05:00.729
 has a weird topic because it turns out that 

00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:03.639
 us and when we get to that 

00:05:00.729 --> 00:05:05.139
 time of 14 15 years in my case my 

00:05:03.639 --> 00:05:07.870
 mother got sick 

00:05:05.139 --> 00:05:09.819
 through all this pressure that 

00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:11.199
 it is already in addition took the pressure in which 

00:05:09.819 --> 00:05:13.389
 I was aware of what was happening 

00:05:11.199 --> 00:05:16.389
 got sick we went to salvador a 

00:05:13.389 --> 00:05:18.129
 time to live with it and then it's back 

00:05:16.389 --> 00:05:20.740
 good return it's like he came back 

00:05:18.129 --> 00:05:23.860
 recharged and there faced him in the house 

00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:25.270
 she went and what she missed was a 

00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:26.740
 gun and told him you're going 

00:05:25.270 --> 00:05:28.150
 immediately from the house or going to 

00:05:26.740 --> 00:05:30.419
 end my life and my life 

00:05:28.150 --> 00:05:30.419
 children 

00:05:31.469 --> 00:05:36.610
 you have done it from the house and dad told me 

00:05:35.229 --> 00:05:37.990
 agreement that he was looking at him from employee 

00:05:36.610 --> 00:05:40.749
 and said boys load on the trucks 

00:05:37.990 --> 00:05:45.240
 we're going and not the lady here 

00:05:40.749 --> 00:05:48.700
 to leave it in truth you were there yes 

00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:50.620
 with her he had three children and his son 

00:05:48.700 --> 00:05:53.020
 Alejandro from Carolina Alejandro and 

00:05:50.620 --> 00:05:55.240
 carolina ok 

00:05:53.020 --> 00:05:57.129
 your dad to her this is part of the 

00:05:55.240 --> 00:06:00.069
 pressures at some point the first 

00:05:57.129 --> 00:06:05.319
 offense that one knows of the record that 

00:06:00.069 --> 00:06:08.139
 there is the year 96 and when he does 

00:06:05.319 --> 00:06:10.840
 to pass for dead was to occupy the 

00:06:08.139 --> 00:06:12.639
 sure now it was an insurance of payment of a 

00:06:10.840 --> 00:06:15.810
 sure life clear he was still 

00:06:12.639 --> 00:06:19.330
 with your mom if they were together and the judge 

00:06:15.810 --> 00:06:21.190
 Díaz is like a comical taxi because it turns out 

00:06:19.330 --> 00:06:23.639
 who sent us all on vacation to 

00:06:21.190 --> 00:06:23.639
 pucón 

00:06:23.910 --> 00:06:29.010
 summer vacation but in these 

00:06:26.460 --> 00:06:31.400
 Papal holiday to his death made him 

00:06:29.010 --> 00:06:31.400
 a funeral 

00:06:31.440 --> 00:06:35.340
 and up here just altered with the radio 

00:06:33.390 --> 00:06:36.840
 of what was happening that already 

00:06:35.340 --> 00:06:40.320
 it was dead had made their 

00:06:36.840 --> 00:06:42.240
 funeral in that I remember that of the 

00:06:40.320 --> 00:06:44.280
 few memories that I have that the 

00:06:42.240 --> 00:06:46.140
 helicopter did not go to look for and the 

00:06:44.280 --> 00:06:48.150
 they brought santiago immediately and 

00:06:46.140 --> 00:06:49.830
 magical write it very clever not in the 

00:06:48.150 --> 00:06:52.020
 outside that they got to be able to 

00:06:49.830 --> 00:06:54.840
 do fast is desperate and I in 

00:06:52.020 --> 00:06:56.840
 helicopter and we arrived to Santiago and mom 

00:06:54.840 --> 00:06:59.160
 of clearly to denounce what 

00:06:56.840 --> 00:07:01.950
 We take sane that him so she 

00:06:59.160 --> 00:07:04.200
 account told us that he arrived he said no 

00:07:01.950 --> 00:07:07.550
 they made me pass for dead and not 

00:07:04.200 --> 00:07:07.550
 I'm dead, I'm alive
