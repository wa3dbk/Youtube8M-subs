00:00:08.710 --> 00:00:13.270
 hello how welcome and welcome 

00:00:10.630 --> 00:00:15.280
 one more day to the channel today I come to talk to you 

00:00:13.270 --> 00:00:16.330
 of this anti-blemish treatment that is 

00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:18.160
 the new treatment that I am 

00:00:16.330 --> 00:00:20.020
 using a few months to here from 

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:21.520
 July now at the end of November that 

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:24.460
 we have been five months 

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:26.140
 approximately and well I also wanted 

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:27.970
 make a little clarification because 

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:30.399
 At first I did not plan to go up 

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:32.829
 this video is worth it because the products that 

00:00:30.399 --> 00:00:35.620
 I'm going to teach some are this duo that 

00:00:32.829 --> 00:00:37.329
 it's called a powerful duo and it's from medicaid and 

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:38.770
 well many of you know that I 

00:00:37.329 --> 00:00:40.600
 I am an independent consultant for Mary 

00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:43.390
 Kate I do not mind saying it backwards it's 

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:45.730
 I love to say it because I'm 

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:47.859
 happy I'm super happy and not just 

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:49.660
 work level that I am working and 

00:00:47.859 --> 00:00:51.850
 I am very happy but personally 

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:53.800
 being in medicaid has meant a before and 

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:55.329
 a later for me really and why 

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:57.969
 do not share that even when a person 

00:00:55.329 --> 00:01:00.159
 she is happy is happy not have to 

00:00:57.969 --> 00:01:01.929
 what a shame of it, yes, to me 

00:01:00.159 --> 00:01:04.089
 It's going well, girl, I want it 

00:01:01.929 --> 00:01:06.220
 share with you and I know that the 

00:01:04.089 --> 00:01:08.320
 most of you are happy but there are 

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:10.810
 other people who are perhaps something 

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:13.390
 envious or somewhat insecure 

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:15.640
 they do not like it and are distrustful then 

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:17.920
 Well I do not care sincerely, I think 

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:19.869
 that the people who follow me and who 

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:22.299
 wondering what such private command them 

00:01:19.869 --> 00:01:23.979
 stains like that I will merecÃ­ais 

00:01:22.299 --> 00:01:26.110
 I did the video explaining it because if 

00:01:23.979 --> 00:01:28.539
 me'm doing well why not share it 

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:30.070
 with you, so it's worth telling you that 

00:01:28.539 --> 00:01:32.850
 that if any one wants to try the 

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:35.590
 products if you have any questions 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:37.509

00:01:37.509 --> 00:01:40.750

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:51.640
 Contact me that I do not have any 

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:54.340

00:01:57.909 --> 00:02:01.720
 problem your not mine is worth so 

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:03.580
 nothing good and now after done 

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:05.979
 I'll talk about that little clarification 

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:08.110
 of this wonder of products that 

00:02:05.979 --> 00:02:10.140

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:19.470

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:25.650
 so I have to use it for the 

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:27.150
 tomorrow and at night I first clean my 

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:30.000

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:32.370

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:54.520

 enough a week I apply this 

00:02:59.050 --> 00:03:03.250
 mask that is a mask that 

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:05.290
 what it does is enhance the effects of 

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:07.240
 serum a mask enhancer of 

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:09.400
 those effects and I put it on the whole face 

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:11.860
 ok and let her act for 20 minutes 

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:15.010
 then I retire with water and I start 

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:18.160
 worth my treatment I put clean skin 

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:20.500

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:22.510
 is and there is nothing more to do and now 

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:25.300

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:30.460
 four and a half months 

00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:32.050

00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:34.570

00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:36.280
 November and good to tell you that you notice a 

00:03:34.570 --> 00:03:39.030
 dramatic improvement in fact to the 

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:40.870
 sample I refer there is no greater 

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:43.420
 show that the skin 

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:45.130
 here you can see me look at the 

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:46.750
 spots around here have practically 

00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:49.060
 disappeared to see are still a 

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:50.770
 little bit not a little shadow because a 

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:52.900
 stain erase the whole is practically 

00:03:50.770 --> 00:03:54.700
 impossible but I have to say that it 

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:57.340
 they have blurred a lot that with a little 

00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:59.170
 of makeup unify the tone and what 

00:03:57.340 --> 00:04:01.030
 disguise perfectly and I the ones that 

00:03:59.170 --> 00:04:03.310
 continue for a long time you can see 

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:05.620

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:07.420

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:12.790
 you know and that nothing that is wonderful 

00:04:09.819 --> 00:04:15.400
 of price is great is very competitive 

00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:19.510
 the price and good is the mask has 

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:21.400
 85 grams the serum has 29 and I tell you 

00:04:19.510 --> 00:04:23.800
