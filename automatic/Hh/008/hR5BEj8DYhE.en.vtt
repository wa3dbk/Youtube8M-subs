00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:13.060 
different textures a lot easier now I'm

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:15.990 
different textures a lot easier now I'm
not<00:03:13.330> going<00:03:13.480> to<00:03:13.570> cut<00:03:13.720> my<00:03:13.870> hair<00:03:14.140> until<00:03:15.010> my<00:03:15.790> one

00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:16.000 
not going to cut my hair until my one

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.950 
not going to cut my hair until my one
year<00:03:16.120> anniversary<00:03:16.950> just<00:03:17.950> because<00:03:18.220> my<00:03:18.460> hair

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:18.960 
year anniversary just because my hair

00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:22.980 
year anniversary just because my hair
has<00:03:19.960> grown<00:03:20.260> so<00:03:20.980> differently<00:03:21.460> and<00:03:21.930> remember<00:03:22.930> I

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:22.990 
has grown so differently and remember I

00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:26.850 
has grown so differently and remember I
told<00:03:23.230> you<00:03:23.470> that<00:03:23.530> my<00:03:23.890> hair<00:03:24.810> grows<00:03:25.810> the<00:03:26.380> quickest

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:26.860 
told you that my hair grows the quickest

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:29.730 
told you that my hair grows the quickest
so<00:03:27.550> it's<00:03:27.700> the<00:03:27.820> longest<00:03:28.090> around<00:03:29.020> perimeter<00:03:29.290> and

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:29.740 
so it's the longest around perimeter and

00:03:29.740 --> 00:03:32.970 
so it's the longest around perimeter and
as<00:03:30.670> we<00:03:30.850> go<00:03:31.030> to<00:03:31.090> the<00:03:31.360> crown<00:03:31.660> it<00:03:32.110> gets<00:03:32.290> shorter

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:32.980 
as we go to the crown it gets shorter

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:34.650 
as we go to the crown it gets shorter
and<00:03:33.010> shorter<00:03:33.160> and<00:03:33.640> it's<00:03:34.240> not<00:03:34.360> because<00:03:34.450> a

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:34.660 
and shorter and it's not because a

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:36.990 
and shorter and it's not because a
breakage<00:03:35.140> is<00:03:35.410> just<00:03:35.650> that<00:03:35.770> that<00:03:35.920> hair<00:03:36.370> grows<00:03:36.970> a

00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:37.000 
breakage is just that that hair grows a

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:41.670 
breakage is just that that hair grows a
lot<00:03:37.480> slower<00:03:38.310> so<00:03:39.480> whereas<00:03:40.480> the<00:03:40.690> hair<00:03:40.990> around<00:03:41.290> my

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:41.680 
lot slower so whereas the hair around my

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:43.860 
lot slower so whereas the hair around my
perimeter<00:03:42.040> of<00:03:42.250> my<00:03:42.460> head<00:03:42.730> might<00:03:43.240> be<00:03:43.480> five

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:43.870 
perimeter of my head might be five

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:46.980 
perimeter of my head might be five
inches<00:03:44.230> long<00:03:44.440> at<00:03:44.620> this<00:03:44.770> point<00:03:45.300> this<00:03:46.300> back<00:03:46.660> part

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:46.990 
inches long at this point this back part

00:03:46.990 --> 00:03:49.800 
inches long at this point this back part
where<00:03:47.740> the<00:03:47.830> upstairs<00:03:48.280> kitchen<00:03:48.490> this<00:03:48.880> is<00:03:49.120> about

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:49.810 
where the upstairs kitchen this is about

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:52.820 
where the upstairs kitchen this is about
two<00:03:50.470> and<00:03:50.590> a<00:03:50.680> half<00:03:50.710> to<00:03:51.010> three<00:03:51.040> inches<00:03:51.340> long<00:03:51.700> so

00:03:52.820 --> 00:03:52.830 
two and a half to three inches long so

00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:55.500

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:21.130 
only it will be layers anymore they'll

00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:22.629 
only it will be layers anymore they'll
just<00:04:21.310> be<00:04:21.489> all<00:04:21.729> coming<00:04:22.180> down

00:05:26.950 --> 00:05:26.960 
correct way and so I'm really looking

00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:28.809 
correct way and so I'm really looking
forward<00:05:27.229> to<00:05:27.500> be<00:05:27.620> able<00:05:27.800> to<00:05:27.919> do<00:05:28.039> that<00:05:28.219> but<00:05:28.729> I<00:05:28.789> just

00:05:28.809 --> 00:05:28.819 
forward to be able to do that but I just

00:05:28.819 --> 00:05:30.159 
forward to be able to do that but I just
need<00:05:29.150> some<00:05:29.180> more<00:05:29.449> length<00:05:29.689> because<00:05:29.930> when<00:05:30.080> you

00:05:30.159 --> 00:05:30.169 
need some more length because when you

00:05:30.169 --> 00:05:32.019 
need some more length because when you
have<00:05:30.199> fake<00:05:30.560> nails<00:05:30.770> it's<00:05:31.250> just<00:05:31.460> really<00:05:31.580> hard<00:05:31.849> to

00:05:32.019 --> 00:05:32.029 
have fake nails it's just really hard to

00:05:32.029 --> 00:05:35.619 
have fake nails it's just really hard to
get<00:05:32.270> the<00:05:32.419> styles<00:05:32.960> and<00:05:33.110> to<00:05:34.009> to<00:05:34.699> twist<00:05:35.000> the<00:05:35.150> ends

00:05:35.629 --> 00:05:37.709 
get the styles and to to twist the ends
and<00:05:35.839> grab<00:05:36.139> the<00:05:36.319> hair<00:05:36.529> like<00:05:36.710> you<00:05:36.830> need<00:05:37.009> to<00:05:37.219> and

00:05:40.879 --> 00:05:42.309 
flat twist i don't think i'll be doing
that<00:05:41.180> because<00:05:41.360> it's<00:05:41.539> very<00:05:41.659> hard<00:05:41.990> I've<00:05:42.259> tried

00:05:42.309 --> 00:05:42.319

happy with this regimen because it adds

00:05:56.449 --> 00:05:58.839 
happy with this regimen because it adds
moisture<00:05:56.990> to<00:05:57.319> my<00:05:57.439> hair<00:05:57.680> we<00:05:58.310> are<00:05:58.430> moving<00:05:58.580> into

the<00:05:59.000> wintertime<00:05:59.449> and<00:05:59.750> so<00:05:59.990> it's<00:06:00.110> very

00:06:00.189 --> 00:06:00.199 
the wintertime and so it's very

00:06:00.199 --> 00:06:01.300 
the wintertime and so it's very
important<00:06:00.620> to<00:06:00.649> me<00:06:00.710> to<00:06:00.830> keep<00:06:00.979> my<00:06:01.129> hair

00:06:01.300 --> 00:06:01.310
