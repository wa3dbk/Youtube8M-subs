00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:24.100
 Sergey today's video we will do 

00:00:21.940 --> 00:00:26.440
 with you here is such a compress which is clearly 

00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:28.960
 called the flirt to me every pretty 

00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:31.630
 it turned out successful though a little and 

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:33.190
 unusual for me if you're interested 

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:36.340
 how did this image go 

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:39.160
 stay with me start makeup 

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:41.710
 should be eyebrow seats in this 

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:54.309
 eyebrows should be higher 

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:57.129
 and more such average thickness let you down 

00:00:54.309 --> 00:01:00.220
 the bottom line of the fraction contour which us 

00:00:57.129 --> 00:01:11.190
 need to do and then blend the top 

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:11.190
 edge like this and repeat cost 

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:20.320
 These are the traffic jams we have turned losses 

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:25.080
 my turn to the design of the eyes for 

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:28.930
 This I will put the base under the shadows from the art to 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:33.600
 more so thick as us 

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:36.550
 need to be intensely transmitted color 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:38.680
 then go to the makeup itself as 

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:41.040
 I want to use a palette in pink 

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:44.020
 colors for make up coquette 

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:46.180
 I will use pink color only 

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:49.600
 the only thing I have is pink 

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:53.620
 shadows so i replaced the ion rouge from 

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:56.050
 oriflame will apply this color 

00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:59.490
 the applicator u so much as it is stuffy to me 

00:01:56.050 --> 00:01:59.490
 intense deposition 

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:09.270
 not 

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:20.340
 so in what form you put these tags 

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:21.120
 then we take a little bit of light 

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:24.450
 shade 

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:26.430
 I will have shades of shadow and more precisely 

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:29.490
 this shade the very old collection rates 

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:33.260
 so unfortunately the number I will not tell you 

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:36.209
 and put them a little under the brow and 

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:39.230
 then to the outer corner more precisely on 

00:02:36.209 --> 00:02:39.230
 inner corner of the eye 

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:52.060
 so then go to dark shadows for 

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:55.440
 of this i take my palette from mallow on 

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:58.800
 mane 04 is this purple hue and 

00:02:55.440 --> 00:03:03.239
 I will put on the fold of the century 

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:03.239
 makes such a small corner 

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:28.689
 so then take a brush and blend 

00:03:22.209 --> 00:03:33.099
 the edges of this option turned out then I 

00:03:28.689 --> 00:03:35.409
 I take a green pencil from plea to 

00:03:33.099 --> 00:03:37.659
 Sorry I can not find his number all 

00:03:35.409 --> 00:03:43.530
 the cosmetics that I used will indicate 

00:03:37.659 --> 00:03:43.530
 under the video and draw the lower eyelid 

00:03:52.360 --> 00:04:00.460
 so a little this feather 

00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:10.460
 then take the usual black eyeliner 

00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:13.880
 eyeliner again I have no on with you 

00:04:10.460 --> 00:04:18.580
 the simplest is the cheapest and will do 

00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:18.580
 arrow in preferably flow 

00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:37.680
 Here we have this 3 nychka 

00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:40.030
 In principle, all we have left is 

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:43.450
 draw the inner eyelid black 

00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:46.500
 pencil to do a little 

00:04:43.450 --> 00:04:46.500
 eye contour is wild 

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:58.830
 and apply mascara and then repeat it all 

00:04:52.949 --> 00:05:01.970
 with the second eye of course we add 

00:04:58.830 --> 00:05:01.970
 a little blush 

00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:14.520
 and also so krasin sponge 

00:05:19.650 --> 00:05:28.430

00:05:40.180 --> 00:05:44.650

00:05:42.460 --> 00:05:47.220

00:05:47.220 --> 00:05:50.350
