00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:02.250
 Hmm 

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:09.809
 Hello Hello minute 

00:00:05.610 --> 00:00:14.050
 Today's introduction is Honda's Insight si 

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:17.460
 Insight Yes in 2004 

00:00:14.050 --> 00:00:22.150
 December 25 years from inspection Yes 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:25.240
 Running sound trigger Well is 48,900 value ordering 

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:29.270
 After all, this first-generation insight yes 

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:31.620
 Manual speed is right right 

00:00:29.270 --> 00:00:35.329
 Domestic sales volume is 

00:00:31.620 --> 00:00:40.490
 Approximately 2300 units Yes them 

00:00:35.329 --> 00:00:43.970
 About 500 manual 5 speeders have changed 

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:46.000
 It is a mountain rare one Yes 

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:46.000
 Hmm 

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:53.829
 Exercise or good site 

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:53.829
 I'm say the beginning Well for the first time place 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:01:00.590
 Do It is bad is lighter than the value chroman 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:11.400
 The first insights are right now , but they are pretty stuck 

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:14.050
 The body is aluminum bony until it was made 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:19.690
 re or yes yeah 

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:20.840
 Those that say the front fender Toka bumper and the car also receives a return number ten 

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:23.230
 Yes 

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:25.510
 You Yes using the 

00:01:23.230 --> 00:01:31.200
 It it is from Nee 

00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:33.500
 In terms of suspension , the front lower arm etc. is aluminum 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:37.500
 Arm is aluminum 

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:40.890
 For example, Mazda's rx 7 places 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:45.060
 It is love and bromaga some sports water 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:49.040
 That 's right yes it looks like this for this 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:49.040
 It seems that it is important to panic 

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:52.259
 after 

00:01:53.950 --> 00:02:03.420
 Well I front caliper is is also one day aluminum calipers that any additional ration 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:07.020
 Then I also like the rear drum fins 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:08.100
 The heat voice was by the heat 

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:11.210
 Aluminum 

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:11.210
 Is the statement Yes 

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:17.440
 It is so in order to reduce the weight of say 

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:19.660
 It seems 

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:26.350
 Why 8 o 

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:29.069
 For a 5-speed transmission, the total weight is the vehicle weight foil 820 

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:32.870
 Than recent minicars 

00:02:29.069 --> 00:02:32.870
 That's right pretty cars 

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:41.280
 I can tell this by reason to go 

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:41.280
 You are yours 

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:46.020
 I told you 

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:53.280
 ni 

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:57.680
 Or really feel that handling was riding a really good so that the sound-sex Kamui 

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:57.680
 I do not want to live like a well 

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:04.170
 Well the overall volume is light but also 

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:06.460
 me 

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:10.360
 This is 

00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:14.130
 In guy mother which had been that the so-called blades say Curly 

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:17.180
 Handling Toka Per feeling so say so is 

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:17.180
 Book of boundaries 

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:26.240
 So it's a hybrid 

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:30.440
 I rode Well I'd say even to be called to enter lightly the body 

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:33.190
 Feeling also by I move the pile is a lot of fun and Nnn 

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:33.190
 It is good, is not it 

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:39.069
 Aso is a design that has just appeared, but 

00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:44.950
 up 

00:03:39.069 --> 00:03:48.129
 Air resistance is a ballet and an example 

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:53.340
 My brother is top class in Japan 

00:03:48.129 --> 00:03:53.340
 Even nsx 0.33 

00:03:53.460 --> 00:03:59.450
 How much air flow 

00:03:56.200 --> 00:04:02.580
 Tsu each's the fortune What Yes resistance 

00:03:59.450 --> 00:04:05.410
 In addition 

00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:08.950
 In addition 

00:04:05.410 --> 00:04:11.880
 It is from 16 people 2004 

00:04:08.950 --> 00:04:11.880
 Excuse me 

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:20.230
 A minor change has been introduced, ima's system change, etc. 

00:04:18.290 --> 00:04:22.079
 It Karaato 

00:04:20.230 --> 00:04:23.960
 Boo Boo N 

00:04:22.079 --> 00:04:28.490
 I was a good body 

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:30.230
 Specially also to So you like a rectification plate Australian-speed transmission 

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:33.680
 It is with force 

00:04:30.230 --> 00:04:35.950
 So liter 36 kg catalog value impression 

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:39.770
 Hai comes to come out 

00:04:35.950 --> 00:04:41.689
 It is a great many sounds but 

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:45.610
 Maan 

00:04:41.689 --> 00:04:45.610
 Woman's first hybrid food 

00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:54.610
 Make 

00:04:51.249 --> 00:04:58.620
 And to make a sports car or rather Meijingu mother 

00:04:54.610 --> 00:05:01.540
 I think it might be like 

00:04:58.620 --> 00:05:05.750
 That's right, Rumie comes to the caliper 

00:05:01.540 --> 00:05:08.000
 I hope I'm making it decisively 

00:05:05.750 --> 00:05:10.950
 I think it's a really good car 

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:17.730
 So for example 

00:05:10.950 --> 00:05:24.210
 The engine lost its 3rd class in a weird guy with a slightly sporty setting 

00:05:17.730 --> 00:05:28.370
 In the Naa become selfish say things ride it is if waiting surprisingly a sports mission 

00:05:24.210 --> 00:05:28.370
 Do you think we made and I here I think 

00:05:30.550 --> 00:05:38.729
 It is Toka charge and ran Well Doi but I think that now name it is visible over 

00:05:36.670 --> 00:05:42.029
 This digital meter 

00:05:38.729 --> 00:05:45.900
 Moving to de not a Well it's cool 

00:05:42.029 --> 00:05:48.620
 Good eel the design tell you yes situation 

00:05:45.900 --> 00:05:53.710
 Steering wheel also 

00:05:48.620 --> 00:05:53.710
 s 2000 and design wish will be yes 

00:05:57.910 --> 00:06:07.710
 I urge shoot-up in 5th speed . 

00:06:03.040 --> 00:06:07.710
 It seems to be the first in the country but I get lost 

00:06:08.520 --> 00:06:14.940
 Cut if the lion as 

00:06:11.400 --> 00:06:19.280
 It's supposed this fuel economy is improved 

00:06:14.940 --> 00:06:19.280
 But there is also a place called What both tense 

00:06:21.670 --> 00:06:28.890
 Markon 

00:06:23.040 --> 00:06:35.430
 Even if you don't talk a lot, you are a person who likes the Honda car if you like it surprisingly 

00:06:28.890 --> 00:06:40.930
 Perhaps more people often do is to do is think the kana not you I system from nine losses 

00:06:35.430 --> 00:06:45.040
 Dancers came in this 16 year final model 2 loss 

00:06:40.930 --> 00:06:46.830
 Luck does not have a bar also attached are naturally raw 

00:06:45.040 --> 00:06:50.180
 That changed 

00:06:46.830 --> 00:06:54.460
 Because it is the final form final form of getting 

00:06:50.180 --> 00:06:59.020
 Well, it 's a battery 6 of life prolongation 

00:06:54.460 --> 00:07:03.910
 I'd think the Well of course those of the year corresponding 

00:06:59.020 --> 00:07:07.300
 The check lamp is on and it's good that the fight is down there and so on 

00:07:03.910 --> 00:07:13.020
 Because there is no 

00:07:07.300 --> 00:07:13.020
 I'm'd say I think we'll just use the tee 

00:07:13.360 --> 00:07:18.449
 Can I try this ? Can I deliver? Yes 

00:07:16.500 --> 00:07:23.169
 By all means 

00:07:18.449 --> 00:07:26.400
 If it thinks hybrid well, it is hybrid 

00:07:23.169 --> 00:07:26.400
 While it is truly a liter car 

00:07:26.600 --> 00:07:36.910
 Nde car the force of the 1.5-liter par It is if full use of the motor is of poor Parker 

00:07:33.320 --> 00:07:40.990
 Insight that you can enjoy sporty there 

00:07:36.910 --> 00:07:44.200
 Please consider once by all means 

00:07:40.990 --> 00:07:49.350
 I think if you can contact us 

00:07:44.200 --> 00:07:49.350
 OK then thank you very much
