decided to give you guys an unboxing

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:19.790 
decided to give you guys an unboxing
video<00:00:14.490> of<00:00:14.700> konapun<00:00:16.070> kona<00:00:17.240> poon<00:00:18.240> konapun<00:00:19.109> and

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:19.800 
video of konapun kona poon konapun and

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:22.160 
video of konapun kona poon konapun and
it<00:00:20.130> is<00:00:20.279> basically<00:00:20.640> a<00:00:20.760> kit<00:00:21.270> i<00:00:21.300> think<00:00:21.630> from<00:00:21.810> china

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:22.170 
it is basically a kit i think from china

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:25.670 
it is basically a kit i think from china
a<00:00:23.090> lot<00:00:24.090> of<00:00:24.119> people<00:00:24.240> will<00:00:24.539> say<00:00:24.720> Japan<00:00:24.960> I<00:00:25.439> think

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:25.680 
a lot of people will say Japan I think

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:28.580 
a lot of people will say Japan I think
it's<00:00:25.830> from<00:00:26.160> Japan<00:00:26.609> but<00:00:26.849> the<00:00:27.230> directions<00:00:28.230> were

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:28.590 
it's from Japan but the directions were

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:32.359 
it's from Japan but the directions were
in<00:00:29.160> Chinese<00:00:30.170> so<00:00:31.170> I'm<00:00:31.380> guessing<00:00:31.710> it<00:00:32.070> is<00:00:32.189> most

00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:32.369 
in Chinese so I'm guessing it is most

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:34.370 
in Chinese so I'm guessing it is most
likely<00:00:32.430> from<00:00:32.700> China<00:00:33.149> and<00:00:33.390> they're<00:00:33.930> basically

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:34.380 
likely from China and they're basically

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:40.010 
likely from China and they're basically
like<00:00:34.500> uh<00:00:35.840> not<00:00:36.840> edible<00:00:38.180> food<00:00:39.180> making<00:00:39.390> kit<00:00:39.780> so

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:40.020 
like uh not edible food making kit so

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:41.420
