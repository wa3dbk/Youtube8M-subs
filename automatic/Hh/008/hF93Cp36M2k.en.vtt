00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:34.740 
there on Toshiba products I also forgot

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:36.770 
there on Toshiba products I also forgot
to<00:02:34.890> mention<00:02:35.070> that<00:02:35.310> it's<00:02:35.640> really<00:02:36.210> extremely

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:36.780 
to mention that it's really extremely

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:39.320 
to mention that it's really extremely
thin<00:02:37.230> and<00:02:37.530> it's<00:02:37.800> extremely<00:02:38.760> light<00:02:39.000> I<00:02:39.210> think

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:39.330 
thin and it's extremely light I think

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:42.410 
thin and it's extremely light I think
they've<00:02:39.720> listed<00:02:40.230> as<00:02:40.560> 13<00:02:41.160> pounds<00:02:41.880> but<00:02:42.180> I'm

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:42.420 
they've listed as 13 pounds but I'm

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:45.410 
they've listed as 13 pounds but I'm
guessing<00:02:42.960> it's<00:02:43.140> like<00:02:43.380> seven<00:02:44.130> so<00:02:45.000> that's<00:02:45.210> my

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:45.420 
guessing it's like seven so that's my

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:47.360 
guessing it's like seven so that's my
review<00:02:45.720> so<00:02:45.780> I<00:02:46.080> hope<00:02:46.320> you<00:02:46.470> guys<00:02:46.650> enjoyed<00:02:47.070> it<00:02:47.220> and
