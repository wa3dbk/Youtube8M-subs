00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:24.570 
here and super excited and I was so

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:26.240 
here and super excited and I was so
impressed<00:00:24.779> with<00:00:25.350> the<00:00:25.439> fabric<00:00:25.890> and<00:00:26.099> the

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:26.250 
impressed with the fabric and the

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:27.769 
impressed with the fabric and the
material<00:00:26.760> I<00:00:26.939> thought<00:00:27.090> they'd<00:00:27.300> be<00:00:27.480> a<00:00:27.510> little

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:27.779 
material I thought they'd be a little

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:31.939 
material I thought they'd be a little
bit<00:00:27.930> more<00:00:28.109> TP<00:00:29.359> but<00:00:30.359> they're<00:00:30.510> not<00:00:30.660> at<00:00:30.869> all<00:00:30.990> rue21

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:31.949 
bit more TP but they're not at all rue21

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:35.479 
bit more TP but they're not at all rue21
if<00:00:32.669> you<00:00:32.790> know<00:00:32.969> their<00:00:33.300> fabric<00:00:34.370> especially<00:00:35.370> with

00:00:35.479 --> 00:00:35.489 
if you know their fabric especially with

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:37.310 
if you know their fabric especially with
their<00:00:35.670> shirts<00:00:35.969> I<00:00:36.270> was<00:00:36.510> thinking<00:00:36.840> it'd<00:00:36.960> be<00:00:37.110> more

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:37.320 
their shirts I was thinking it'd be more

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:39.889 
their shirts I was thinking it'd be more
along<00:00:37.649> the<00:00:37.680> line<00:00:38.070> like<00:00:38.250> that<00:00:38.480> but<00:00:39.480> this<00:00:39.629> is

00:00:39.889 --> 00:00:39.899 
along the line like that but this is

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:43.790 
along the line like that but this is
actually<00:00:40.379> a<00:00:40.800> lot<00:00:41.160> better<00:00:41.219> than<00:00:42.050> wet<00:00:43.050> seal<00:00:43.320> or

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:43.800 
actually a lot better than wet seal or

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:46.910 
actually a lot better than wet seal or
forever<00:00:44.190> 21<00:00:44.670> it's<00:00:45.000> really<00:00:45.600> up<00:00:45.780> there<00:00:46.020> and<00:00:46.289> this

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
forever 21 it's really up there and this

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:48.440 
forever 21 it's really up there and this
website<00:00:47.399> definitely<00:00:47.850> should<00:00:48.120> not<00:00:48.149> go

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:48.450 
website definitely should not go

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:50.660 
website definitely should not go
unrecognized<00:00:49.320> and<00:00:49.590> they<00:00:50.250> have<00:00:50.399> a<00:00:50.430> ton<00:00:50.640> of

unrecognized and they have a ton of

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:52.790 
unrecognized and they have a ton of
