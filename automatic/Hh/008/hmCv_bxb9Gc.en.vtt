00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:09.600
 it does not change much obviously what 

00:00:06.340 --> 00:00:09.600
 we have a lot of rotation 

00:00:09.769 --> 00:00:18.199
 with frame fabian with formica con con 

00:00:13.759 --> 00:00:21.110
 joao with mariano the truth that we are the 

00:00:18.199 --> 00:00:23.900
 responsible for generating football towards 

00:00:21.110 --> 00:00:26.989
 forward and then good nothing like 

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:28.640
 let's finish the play accommodate us where 

00:00:26.989 --> 00:00:30.079
 where we end up we 're not just 

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:32.800
 used to maybe play another 

00:00:30.079 --> 00:00:32.800
 way to touch 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:39.329
 we do not take advantage of the 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:41.910
 speed of joao now marco fabian who 

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:43.410
 I will assume stick a little more 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:45.420
 intensity 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:48.719
 let's say change the pace or handle the 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:51.960
 parties I think that's what what 

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:53.730
 we want to make a team that knows when 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:55.530
 you have to go fast know when you have 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:57.140
 have to pause when we have to 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:01:00.920
 throw us through handle the ball 

00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:03.149
 when we have to defend I think that 

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:06.090
 We have worked on many variants 

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:09.390
 where we really want to make a team 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:11.280
 where we enter the court and that is all 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:14.080
 let's know what we have to do each 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:16.450
 coach has his style 

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:18.460
 obviously what 

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:23.250
 the style has changed because good 

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:27.900
 we eat we were more to elaborate the play 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:30.030
 here we try to be more vertical 

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:34.430
 when you can not try to have it 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:37.560
 but in general terms we try to 

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:38.910
 make it a strong strong team 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:42.060
 mentally there has to be a 

00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:43.730
 balance and know what blue cross is 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:46.160
 he has to do strong 

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:50.210
 what happened to us last tournament was that 

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:53.540
 we did not go consistent and we went very 

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:55.380
 regular ones and that did not happen with 

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:57.899
 toluca 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:02:00.560
 but what we want is a very team 

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:03.119
 solid a team that knows what it plays 

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:06.479
 a team that does not change its way of 

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:10.050
 play both local and visitor are 

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:11.940
 accommodates the rivals and we work 

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:14.269
 to make a leading team that is 

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:14.269
 the most important
