00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:45.310 
then um halfway into the song when it

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:49.810 
then um halfway into the song when it
when<00:01:46.310> it<00:01:46.340> does<00:01:46.550> those<00:01:47.440> that<00:01:48.440> part<00:01:48.680> again<00:01:48.820> the

when it does those that part again the

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:58.890 
when it does those that part again the
second<00:01:50.180> guitar<00:01:50.479> is<00:01:50.630> playing<00:01:55.479> that<00:01:56.479> thing<00:01:57.759> ok

00:01:58.890 --> 00:01:58.900 
second guitar is playing that thing ok

00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:04.540 
second guitar is playing that thing ok
that<00:01:59.900> is<00:01:59.930> on<00:02:00.440> the<00:02:01.210> let's<00:02:02.210> see<00:02:03.340> that's<00:02:04.340> on<00:02:04.460> the

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:04.550 
that is on the let's see that's on the

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:08.949 
that is on the let's see that's on the
fourth<00:02:04.850> string<00:02:04.910> ok<00:02:07.360> and<00:02:08.360> this<00:02:08.570> is<00:02:08.720> the<00:02:08.780> eighth

00:02:08.949 --> 00:02:08.959 
fourth string ok and this is the eighth

00:02:08.959 --> 00:02:13.570 
fourth string ok and this is the eighth
fret<00:02:09.320> right<00:02:09.739> here<00:02:09.920> ok<00:02:10.610> so<00:02:11.540> it's<00:02:11.660> open<00:02:12.580> eighth

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:13.580 
fret right here ok so it's open eighth

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:21.460 
fret right here ok so it's open eighth
and<00:02:14.090> then<00:02:14.480> open<00:02:15.050> and<00:02:15.290> then<00:02:15.410> it<00:02:15.560> seven<00:02:20.290> you<00:02:21.290> want

and then open and then it seven you want
to<00:02:21.530> do<00:02:21.650> this<00:02:21.830> half<00:02:22.430> of<00:02:22.580> it<00:02:22.700> would<00:02:22.940> be<00:02:23.060> palm<00:02:23.330> mute

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:23.630 
to do this half of it would be palm mute

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:25.930 
to do this half of it would be palm mute
and<00:02:23.810> then<00:02:24.590> you<00:02:24.739> can<00:02:24.890> do<00:02:25.070> when<00:02:25.459> it's<00:02:25.580> when

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:25.940 
and then you can do when it's when

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:27.190 
and then you can do when it's when
you're<00:02:26.060> not<00:02:26.150> doing<00:02:26.360> the<00:02:26.450> palm<00:02:26.630> you<00:02:26.840> can<00:02:27.080> do

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:27.200 
you're not doing the palm you can do

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:29.259 
you're not doing the palm you can do
like<00:02:27.350> a<00:02:27.410> kind<00:02:28.010> of<00:02:28.040> a<00:02:28.130> half-assed<00:02:28.640> pinch

00:02:29.259 --> 00:02:29.269 
like a kind of a half-assed pinch

00:02:29.269 --> 00:02:35.500 
like a kind of a half-assed pinch
harmonic<00:02:31.269> ok<00:02:32.269> and<00:02:32.620> then<00:02:33.620> this<00:02:33.739> snow<00:02:34.030> is<00:02:35.030> on<00:02:35.450> the

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:35.510 
harmonic ok and then this snow is on the

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:47.870 
harmonic ok and then this snow is on the
third<00:02:35.870> string<00:02:36.230> is<00:02:36.440> on<00:02:36.980> 10th<00:02:37.310> fret<00:02:37.550> so

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:47.880 

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:51.390 

okay<00:02:48.880> from<00:02:49.540> there<00:02:49.750> on<00:02:50.020> the<00:02:50.620> third<00:02:50.800> string<00:02:51.040> he

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:51.400 
okay from there on the third string he

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:55.860 
okay from there on the third string he
moves<00:02:51.610> up<00:02:51.790> to<00:02:51.910> the<00:02:52.120> 12th<00:02:52.420> fret<00:02:53.880> okay<00:02:54.880> and<00:02:55.240> then

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:55.870 
moves up to the 12th fret okay and then

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:59.250 
moves up to the 12th fret okay and then
goes<00:02:56.080> up<00:02:56.110> to<00:02:56.320> the<00:02:56.380> 15th<00:02:57.540> and<00:02:58.540> these<00:02:59.020> are<00:02:59.080> going

00:02:59.250 --> 00:02:59.260 
goes up to the 15th and these are going

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:01.200 
goes up to the 15th and these are going
to<00:02:59.320> be<00:02:59.380> harmonics<00:02:59.980> also<00:03:00.400> so<00:03:00.700> it's<00:03:00.850> gonna<00:03:00.970> sound

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:01.210 
to be harmonics also so it's gonna sound

00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:18.720 
to be harmonics also so it's gonna sound
like<00:03:03.270> okay<00:03:04.270> all<00:03:05.050> right<00:03:05.200> so<00:03:05.380> all<00:03:05.620> together<00:03:17.730> all

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:18.730 
like okay all right so all together all

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:30.940 
like okay all right so all together all
right<00:03:18.880> so<00:03:19.120> up<00:03:19.390> to<00:03:19.630> speed<00:03:20.430> think<00:03:21.430> it<00:03:21.550> was<00:03:21.640> like

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:30.950 

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:35.180 

okay<00:03:32.690> other<00:03:33.690> than<00:03:33.959> that<00:03:34.019> part's<00:03:34.950> kind<00:03:35.069> of

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:35.190 
okay other than that part's kind of

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:36.860 
okay other than that part's kind of
tricky<00:03:35.549> it<00:03:35.790> kind<00:03:36.030> of<00:03:36.090> jumps<00:03:36.269> around<00:03:36.450> but<00:03:36.840> I

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:36.870 
tricky it kind of jumps around but I

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:39.619

00:03:56.980 --> 00:04:00.790 

what<00:03:57.980> I<00:03:58.130> like<00:03:58.610> to<00:03:58.820> do<00:03:59.440> this<00:04:00.440> is<00:04:00.560> all<00:04:00.650> just

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:00.800 
what I like to do this is all just

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:03.190 
what I like to do this is all just
personal<00:04:01.160> preference<00:04:01.400> by<00:04:01.700> the<00:04:01.820> way<00:04:01.910> so<00:04:02.200> you

00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:03.200 
personal preference by the way so you

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:04.420 
personal preference by the way so you
can<00:04:03.320> ignore<00:04:03.500> this<00:04:03.650> if<00:04:03.920> you<00:04:03.980> don't<00:04:04.010> want<00:04:04.160> to<00:04:04.310> do

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:04.430 
can ignore this if you don't want to do

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:08.700 
can ignore this if you don't want to do
it<00:04:04.630> I'm<00:04:05.630> gonna<00:04:05.900> for<00:04:06.620> example<00:04:06.950> if<00:04:07.040> it's<00:04:07.160> an<00:04:07.280> open

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:08.710 
it I'm gonna for example if it's an open

00:04:08.710 --> 00:04:11.140 
it I'm gonna for example if it's an open
okay<00:04:09.710> instead<00:04:10.100> of<00:04:10.160> just<00:04:10.250> the<00:04:10.370> two<00:04:10.520> strings<00:04:10.880> I'm

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:11.150 
okay instead of just the two strings I'm

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:13.180 
okay instead of just the two strings I'm
going<00:04:11.600> to<00:04:11.660> do<00:04:11.780> like<00:04:11.960> a<00:04:11.990> D<00:04:12.290> chord<00:04:12.590> kind<00:04:12.860> of<00:04:12.950> shape

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:13.190 
going to do like a D chord kind of shape

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:17.879 
going to do like a D chord kind of shape
and<00:04:13.370> then<00:04:13.840> from<00:04:14.840> the<00:04:14.960> whole<00:04:15.110> thing

00:04:17.879 --> 00:04:17.889 

00:04:17.889 --> 00:04:20.069 

okay<00:04:18.370> I<00:04:18.609> think<00:04:18.879> that<00:04:18.999> adds<00:04:19.239> a<00:04:19.359> little<00:04:19.479> bit<00:04:19.659> more

00:04:20.069 --> 00:04:20.079 
okay I think that adds a little bit more

00:04:20.079 --> 00:04:23.820 
okay I think that adds a little bit more
of<00:04:20.139> a<00:04:20.319> top<00:04:20.709> end<00:04:20.979> and<00:04:21.280> a<00:04:22.229> little<00:04:23.229> more<00:04:23.319> distinct

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:23.830 
of a top end and a little more distinct

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:27.360 
of a top end and a little more distinct
sound<00:04:24.539> the<00:04:25.539> song<00:04:25.840> is<00:04:25.870> tuned<00:04:26.560> down<00:04:26.680> to<00:04:26.860> see<00:04:27.099> so

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:27.370 
sound the song is tuned down to see so

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:29.820 
sound the song is tuned down to see so
you're<00:04:28.330> going<00:04:28.449> to<00:04:28.539> be<00:04:28.689> the<00:04:29.199> base<00:04:29.349> is<00:04:29.590> going<00:04:29.740> to

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:29.830 
you're going to be the base is going to

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:32.519 
you're going to be the base is going to
be<00:04:29.979> pretty<00:04:30.610> low<00:04:30.879> so<00:04:31.300> it's<00:04:32.050> might<00:04:32.199> add<00:04:32.319> a<00:04:32.349> little

00:04:32.519 --> 00:04:32.529 
be pretty low so it's might add a little

00:04:32.529 --> 00:04:35.010 
be pretty low so it's might add a little
bit<00:04:32.680> of<00:04:32.770> thickness<00:04:33.039> to<00:04:33.370> your<00:04:33.460> sound<00:04:34.020> this

00:04:35.010 --> 00:04:35.020 
bit of thickness to your sound this

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:37.499 
bit of thickness to your sound this
works<00:04:35.409> as<00:04:35.740> a<00:04:35.800> power<00:04:36.249> cord<00:04:36.610> on<00:04:36.879> for<00:04:37.419> example

00:04:37.499 --> 00:04:37.509 
works as a power cord on for example

00:04:37.509 --> 00:04:41.369 
works as a power cord on for example
like<00:04:37.810> 5th<00:04:38.110> fret<00:04:38.259> link<00:04:39.840> instead<00:04:40.840> of<00:04:41.020> just<00:04:41.139> that

00:04:41.369 --> 00:04:41.379 
like 5th fret link instead of just that

00:04:41.379 --> 00:04:50.670 
like 5th fret link instead of just that
i'm<00:04:41.680> going<00:04:41.889> to<00:04:41.949> add<00:04:42.099> those<00:04:42.370> two<00:04:42.550> notes<00:04:42.729> and

00:04:50.670 --> 00:04:50.680
