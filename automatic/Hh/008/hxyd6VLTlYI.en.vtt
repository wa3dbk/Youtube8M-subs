00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
very true hell I played the game like

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:48.469 
very true hell I played the game like
two<00:01:46.799> years<00:01:47.130> ago<00:01:47.430> two<00:01:47.490> and<00:01:47.729> a<00:01:47.880> half<00:01:47.970> years<00:01:48.270> ago

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479 
two years ago two and a half years ago

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:50.300 
two years ago two and a half years ago
and<00:01:48.659> it<00:01:48.750> was<00:01:48.869> borderline<00:01:49.409> unplayable<00:01:49.740> back

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.310 
and it was borderline unplayable back

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:52.910

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:36.900 
modern warfare I feel like it that was

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:39.350 
modern warfare I feel like it that was
the<00:02:37.050> beginning<00:02:37.530> of<00:02:37.650> the<00:02:38.340> decline<00:02:38.520> for<00:02:39.090> coal<00:02:39.240> of

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:42.990 
duty was modern warfare 2 on from a

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:45.650 
duty was modern warfare 2 on from a
gameplay<00:02:43.260> perspective<00:02:43.880> there<00:02:44.880> was<00:02:45.240> too<00:02:45.510> many

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:45.660 
gameplay perspective there was too many

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:48.950 
gameplay perspective there was too many
perks<00:02:46.410> and<00:02:46.830> killstreaks<00:02:47.180> and<00:02:48.180> all<00:02:48.360> that<00:02:48.630> crap

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:48.960 
perks and killstreaks and all that crap

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:51.170 
perks and killstreaks and all that crap
I<00:02:49.230> know<00:02:49.560> people<00:02:49.890> think<00:02:50.190> that<00:02:50.310> oh<00:02:50.430> was<00:02:50.820> the<00:02:50.970> best

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:51.180 
I know people think that oh was the best

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:53.720 
I know people think that oh was the best
balance<00:02:51.660> and<00:02:51.930> it<00:02:51.990> was<00:02:52.110> perfect<00:02:52.590> but<00:02:52.860> I<00:02:53.070> felt

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:53.730 
balance and it was perfect but I felt

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:55.700 
balance and it was perfect but I felt
like<00:02:53.850> it<00:02:54.000> was<00:02:54.120> too<00:02:54.390> much<00:02:54.560> whereas<00:02:55.560> the

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:55.710 
like it was too much whereas the

00:02:55.710 --> 00:02:58.790 
like it was too much whereas the
original<00:02:55.830> modern<00:02:56.580> warfare<00:02:57.260> yeah<00:02:58.260> some<00:02:58.680> people

00:02:58.790 --> 00:02:58.800 
original modern warfare yeah some people

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:00.620 
original modern warfare yeah some people
may<00:02:59.070> see<00:02:59.130> it<00:02:59.460> was<00:02:59.580> threadbare<00:03:00.150> and<00:03:00.210> a<00:03:00.390> little

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:00.630 
may see it was threadbare and a little

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:02.300 
may see it was threadbare and a little
too<00:03:00.780> basic<00:03:01.290> but<00:03:01.440> I<00:03:01.470> felt<00:03:01.770> like<00:03:01.830> it<00:03:01.980> was<00:03:02.100> perfect

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:02.310 
too basic but I felt like it was perfect

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:04.520 
too basic but I felt like it was perfect
with<00:03:02.580> the<00:03:02.970> original<00:03:03.480> modern<00:03:03.780> warfare<00:03:03.990> to<00:03:04.380> me

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:04.530

original modern warfare you felt like it

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:14.270 
original modern warfare you felt like it
was<00:04:12.870> more<00:04:13.110> balanced<00:04:13.590> you<00:04:13.709> felt<00:04:13.950> like<00:04:14.040> if<00:04:14.190> you

00:04:14.270 --> 00:04:14.280 
was more balanced you felt like if you

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:16.370 
was more balanced you felt like if you
were<00:04:14.400> won<00:04:14.670> and<00:04:14.850> gunner<00:04:15.030> like<00:04:15.330> me<00:04:15.570> you<00:04:16.080> still

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:16.380 
were won and gunner like me you still

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:17.870 
were won and gunner like me you still
had<00:04:16.530> and<00:04:16.680> I<00:04:16.739> did<00:04:16.950> do<00:04:17.100> pretty<00:04:17.310> good<00:04:17.489> in<00:04:17.669> that

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:17.880 
had and I did do pretty good in that

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:19.610 
had and I did do pretty good in that
game<00:04:18.060> I<00:04:18.090> wasn't<00:04:18.390> great<00:04:18.780> by<00:04:18.989> any<00:04:19.169> means<00:04:19.440> there

00:04:19.610 --> 00:04:19.620 
game I wasn't great by any means there

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:21.050 
game I wasn't great by any means there
are<00:04:19.709> people<00:04:19.799> that<00:04:20.070> could<00:04:20.190> stop<00:04:20.489> my<00:04:20.669> ass<00:04:20.820> any

00:04:21.050 --> 00:04:21.060 
are people that could stop my ass any

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:23.060 
are people that could stop my ass any
day<00:04:21.150> of<00:04:21.359> the<00:04:21.419> week<00:04:21.600> but<00:04:22.229> I<00:04:22.289> was<00:04:22.830> more

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:23.070 
day of the week but I was more

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:25.610 
day of the week but I was more
competitive<00:04:23.430> because<00:04:24.030> it<00:04:24.930> just<00:04:25.200> felt<00:04:25.440> more

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:25.620 
competitive because it just felt more

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:27.410 
competitive because it just felt more
balanced<00:04:26.160> and<00:04:26.310> it<00:04:26.400> wasn't<00:04:26.580> all<00:04:26.820> about<00:04:26.970> kill

00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:27.420 
balanced and it wasn't all about kill

00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:29.480 
balanced and it wasn't all about kill
streaks<00:04:27.810> cuz<00:04:28.080> the<00:04:28.470> thing<00:04:28.680> with<00:04:28.860> killstreaks

00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:29.490 
streaks cuz the thing with killstreaks

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:31.130 
streaks cuz the thing with killstreaks
especially<00:04:30.180> I<00:04:30.210> remember<00:04:30.720> with<00:04:30.840> modern

00:04:31.130 --> 00:04:31.140 
especially I remember with modern

00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:33.470 
especially I remember with modern
warfare<00:04:31.290> 2<00:04:31.500> is<00:04:31.830> that<00:04:31.980> once<00:04:32.640> someone<00:04:33.060> goes<00:04:33.240> on

00:04:33.470 --> 00:04:33.480 
warfare 2 is that once someone goes on

00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:35.120 
warfare 2 is that once someone goes on
that<00:04:33.600> spiral<00:04:34.260> will<00:04:34.440> they<00:04:34.560> get<00:04:34.680> one<00:04:34.890> kill

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:35.130 
that spiral will they get one kill

00:04:35.130 --> 00:04:36.980 
that spiral will they get one kill
streak<00:04:35.430> and<00:04:35.550> another<00:04:35.790> one<00:04:36.000> another<00:04:36.240> one<00:04:36.360> they

00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:36.990 
streak and another one another one they

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:38.720 
streak and another one another one they
almost<00:04:37.140> become<00:04:37.590> unstoppable<00:04:38.370> and<00:04:38.430> you<00:04:38.550> don't

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:38.730 
almost become unstoppable and you don't

00:04:38.730 --> 00:04:40.880 
almost become unstoppable and you don't
have<00:04:38.850> a<00:04:38.880> chance<00:04:39.240> in<00:04:39.390> hell<00:04:39.420> with<00:04:40.200> the<00:04:40.320> yeah<00:04:40.680> that

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:40.890 
have a chance in hell with the yeah that

00:04:40.890 --> 00:04:42.380 
have a chance in hell with the yeah that
could<00:04:41.040> happen<00:04:41.220> in<00:04:41.520> the<00:04:41.610> original<00:04:42.060> modern

00:04:42.380 --> 00:04:42.390 
could happen in the original modern

00:04:42.390 --> 00:04:44.720 
could happen in the original modern
warfare<00:04:42.630> but<00:04:43.410> because<00:04:43.710> it<00:04:43.860> wasn't<00:04:44.190> all<00:04:44.370> about

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:44.730 
warfare but because it wasn't all about

00:04:44.730 --> 00:04:46.900 
warfare but because it wasn't all about
the<00:04:44.910> kill<00:04:45.270> streaks<00:04:45.660> and<00:04:45.840> all<00:04:46.020> about<00:04:46.290> that<00:04:46.560> crap

00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:46.910 
the kill streaks and all about that crap

00:04:46.910 --> 00:04:49.700 
the kill streaks and all about that crap
you<00:04:47.910> just<00:04:47.940> you<00:04:48.360> felt<00:04:48.630> like<00:04:48.780> even<00:04:49.200> if<00:04:49.320> someone

00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:49.710 
you just you felt like even if someone

00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:51.620 
you just you felt like even if someone
was<00:04:49.890> on<00:04:50.040> a<00:04:50.070> roll<00:04:50.340> you<00:04:50.550> always<00:04:50.880> had<00:04:51.000> a<00:04:51.030> chance<00:04:51.420> to

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:51.630 
was on a roll you always had a chance to

00:04:51.630 --> 00:04:53.660 
was on a roll you always had a chance to
come<00:04:51.870> back<00:04:52.080> and<00:04:52.320> after<00:04:53.040> that<00:04:53.160> when<00:04:53.370> Coll<00:04:53.580> of

00:04:53.660 --> 00:04:53.670 
come back and after that when Coll of

00:04:53.670 --> 00:04:55.250 
come back and after that when Coll of
duty<00:04:53.910> he<00:04:54.030> started<00:04:54.360> getting<00:04:54.480> even<00:04:54.810> bigger<00:04:54.960> with

00:04:55.250 --> 00:04:55.260 
duty he started getting even bigger with

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:57.350 
duty he started getting even bigger with
modern<00:04:55.620> warfare<00:04:55.770> 2<00:04:55.950> black<00:04:56.430> ops<00:04:56.610> black<00:04:56.910> ops<00:04:57.150> 2

00:04:59.750 --> 00:04:59.760 
so on and so forth to me it just felt

00:04:59.760 --> 00:05:02.390 
so on and so forth to me it just felt
like<00:04:59.880> the<00:05:00.030> series<00:05:00.360> went<00:05:00.600> downhill<00:05:00.840> and<00:05:01.410> when

00:05:02.390 --> 00:05:02.400 
like the series went downhill and when

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:03.770 
like the series went downhill and when
the<00:05:02.550> commentators<00:05:03.180> came<00:05:03.390> around<00:05:03.660> it<00:05:03.750> just

00:05:03.770 --> 00:05:03.780 
the commentators came around it just
