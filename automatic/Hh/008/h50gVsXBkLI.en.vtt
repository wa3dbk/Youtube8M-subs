frequently they might eat every one to
three<00:01:07.330> hours<00:01:08.020> however<00:01:08.710> it's<00:01:09.100> really

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:09.190 
three hours however it's really

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:10.890 
three hours however it's really
important<00:01:09.850> that<00:01:09.910> you<00:01:10.180> don't<00:01:10.450> let<00:01:10.570> them<00:01:10.720> go

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:17.410 
meals if your feeding formula again you

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:18.870 
meals if your feeding formula again you
want<00:01:17.590> to<00:01:17.650> talk<00:01:17.830> to<00:01:17.980> your<00:01:18.070> pediatrician<00:01:18.340> to

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:20.500 
decide which one is going to be the best

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:23.460 
decide which one is going to be the best
for<00:01:20.710> you<00:01:20.860> make<00:01:21.640> sure<00:01:21.880> that<00:01:22.210> you<00:01:22.630> when<00:01:23.350> you

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:23.470 
for you make sure that you when you

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:25.680 
for you make sure that you when you
choose<00:01:23.740> a<00:01:23.770> formula<00:01:24.370> you<00:01:24.760> make<00:01:24.970> sure<00:01:25.180> that<00:01:25.210> it

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:25.690 
choose a formula you make sure that it

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:27.720 
choose a formula you make sure that it
is<00:01:25.930> the<00:01:26.350> appropriate<00:01:27.010> age<00:01:27.160> for<00:01:27.430> your<00:01:27.520> baby

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:27.730 
is the appropriate age for your baby

00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:29.460 
is the appropriate age for your baby
this<00:01:28.360> would<00:01:28.540> not<00:01:28.660> be<00:01:28.720> appropriate<00:01:29.380> because

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:29.470 
this would not be appropriate because

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:32.250 
this would not be appropriate because
it's<00:01:29.770> 9<00:01:29.950> to<00:01:30.130> 24<00:01:30.550> months<00:01:31.020> so<00:01:32.020> you<00:01:32.080> would

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:32.260 
it's 9 to 24 months so you would

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:34.740 
it's 9 to 24 months so you would
definitely<00:01:32.410> want<00:01:32.860> to<00:01:32.920> choose<00:01:33.190> a<00:01:33.250> formula<00:01:34.030> that

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:34.750 
definitely want to choose a formula that

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:38.700 
definitely want to choose a formula that
would<00:01:35.080> be<00:01:35.280> 0<00:01:36.280> to<00:01:36.400> 12<00:01:36.730> months<00:01:37.180> if<00:01:37.360> it<00:01:37.870> says<00:01:38.410> iron

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:38.710 
would be 0 to 12 months if it says iron

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:40.410 
would be 0 to 12 months if it says iron
on<00:01:39.010> it<00:01:39.190> it's<00:01:39.400> usually<00:01:39.580> just<00:01:39.940> a<00:01:40.030> regular

00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:40.420 
on it it's usually just a regular

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:42.570 
on it it's usually just a regular
formula<00:01:40.720> because<00:01:41.260> all<00:01:41.530> formulas<00:01:42.040> have<00:01:42.220> iron

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:42.580 
formula because all formulas have iron

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:44.220 
formula because all formulas have iron
added<00:01:42.940> to<00:01:43.060> them<00:01:43.210> because<00:01:43.450> it's<00:01:43.600> so<00:01:43.660> important

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:44.230 
added to them because it's so important

00:01:44.230 --> 00:01:45.330 
added to them because it's so important
for<00:01:44.350> your<00:01:44.470> baby's<00:01:44.800> growth

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:45.340 
for your baby's growth

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:47.480 
for your baby's growth
so<00:01:45.700> this<00:01:45.880> would<00:01:46.060> be<00:01:46.210> just<00:01:46.240> a<00:01:46.600> great<00:01:46.750> general

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:47.490 
so this would be just a great general

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:51.540 
so this would be just a great general
formula<00:01:48.490> for<00:01:48.520> your<00:01:48.760> baby<00:01:49.140> some<00:01:50.140> parents<00:01:50.770> do

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:51.550 
formula for your baby some parents do

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:52.890 
formula for your baby some parents do
you<00:01:51.640> like<00:01:51.940> the<00:01:52.090> fact<00:01:52.360> that<00:01:52.480> they<00:01:52.690> have<00:01:52.870> a

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:52.900 
you like the fact that they have a

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:56.460 
you like the fact that they have a
choice<00:01:53.730> to<00:01:54.730> have<00:01:55.000> a<00:01:55.030> formula<00:01:55.840> that<00:01:56.050> has<00:01:56.230> these

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:56.470 
choice to have a formula that has these

00:01:56.470 --> 00:01:59.730 
choice to have a formula that has these
lipids<00:01:56.920> the<00:01:57.130> DHA<00:01:57.700> and<00:01:57.909> the<00:01:57.970> ARA<00:01:58.390> which<00:01:59.260> are

00:01:59.730 --> 00:01:59.740 
lipids the DHA and the ARA which are

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:28.140 
idea on how much formula to add so these

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:31.640 
idea on how much formula to add so these
are<00:03:28.320> some<00:03:28.500> ideas<00:03:28.650> on<00:03:29.640> formulas<00:03:30.239> and<00:03:30.600> a<00:03:31.050> little
