the public sector data released only
today<00:02:36.720> we<00:02:37.380> know<00:02:37.560> that<00:02:37.670> under<00:02:38.670> spends<00:02:39.000> are

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:39.180 
today we know that under spends are

today we know that under spends are
going<00:02:39.810> we<00:02:40.260> know<00:02:40.380> that<00:02:40.410> the<00:02:40.740> the<00:02:41.160> rate<00:02:41.370> of

spending is less than the obr was
forecast<00:02:43.410> those<00:02:43.590> figures<00:02:43.890> are<00:02:43.950> there<00:02:44.100> today

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:44.280 
forecast those figures are there today

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:46.430 
forecast those figures are there today
where<00:02:44.670> we<00:02:44.970> know<00:02:45.510> also<00:02:45.690> that<00:02:45.810> last<00:02:46.140> year<00:02:46.350> they

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:46.440 
where we know also that last year they

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:47.600 
where we know also that last year they
were<00:02:46.500> four<00:02:46.740> billion<00:02:46.890> of<00:02:47.100> those<00:02:47.220> so<00:02:47.400> they<00:02:47.490> are

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:47.610 
were four billion of those so they are

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:49.220 
were four billion of those so they are
available<00:02:47.760> which<00:02:48.330> department<00:02:48.870> is<00:02:48.960> it<00:02:49.080> going
