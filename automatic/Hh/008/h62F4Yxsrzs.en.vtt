00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850 
about this we haven't we haven't

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:01.459 
about this we haven't we haven't
performed<00:01:00.030> in<00:01:00.359> more<00:01:00.510> cops<00:01:00.780> and<00:01:00.930> that's<00:01:01.170> we

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:01.469 
performed in more cops and that's we

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:03.619 
performed in more cops and that's we
have<00:01:01.620> tonight<00:01:01.739> yeah<00:01:02.399> exactly<00:01:02.550> so<00:01:02.910> they<00:01:03.149> left

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629 
have tonight yeah exactly so they left

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:05.119 
have tonight yeah exactly so they left
tonight<00:01:04.049> be<00:01:04.170> the<00:01:04.199> starting<00:01:04.619> point<00:01:04.799> not<00:01:05.010> the

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
tonight be the starting point not the

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:08.649 
tonight be the starting point not the
finishing<00:01:05.489> point<00:01:05.670> and<00:01:05.939> I<00:01:05.970> think<00:01:06.830> it's<00:01:07.830> a<00:01:08.070> huge

00:01:08.649 --> 00:01:08.659 
finishing point and I think it's a huge

00:01:08.659 --> 00:01:12.500 
finishing point and I think it's a huge
opportunity<00:01:09.659> no<00:01:10.110> for<00:01:10.320> us<00:01:11.180> we're<00:01:12.180> in<00:01:12.210> control

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
opportunity no for us we're in control

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:14.450 
opportunity no for us we're in control
of<00:01:12.720> our<00:01:12.840> destiny<00:01:13.290> with<00:01:13.560> big<00:01:13.799> games<00:01:14.040> coming<00:01:14.159> up

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
of our destiny with big games coming up

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:16.820 
of our destiny with big games coming up
and<00:01:14.700> I<00:01:15.270> think<00:01:16.020> we<00:01:16.110> were<00:01:16.229> really<00:01:16.350> happy<00:01:16.710> you

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
and I think we were really happy you

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:19.160 
and I think we were really happy you
know<00:01:16.920> you<00:01:16.979> did<00:01:17.100> camp<00:01:17.310> and<00:01:17.780> some<00:01:18.780> quality

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
know you did camp and some quality

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:22.070 
know you did camp and some quality
players<00:01:19.439> there<00:01:19.710> I<00:01:19.890> think<00:01:20.189> just<00:01:20.340> think<00:01:21.020> it's<00:01:22.020> a

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080 
players there I think just think it's a

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:23.960 
players there I think just think it's a
far<00:01:22.259> superior<00:01:22.439> level<00:01:22.950> than<00:01:23.189> Heineken<00:01:23.580> Cup<00:01:23.700> or

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
far superior level than Heineken Cup or

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:26.600 
far superior level than Heineken Cup or
Monster<00:01:24.509> Lantern<00:01:24.990> I<00:01:25.200> think<00:01:25.799> that<00:01:25.950> we<00:01:26.130> needed

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610 
Monster Lantern I think that we needed

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:28.130 
Monster Lantern I think that we needed
to<00:01:26.700> see<00:01:26.850> that<00:01:27.030> out<00:01:27.299> of<00:01:27.450> each<00:01:27.570> other<00:01:27.720> tonight<00:01:27.900> to

play for each other and we're ready for
this<00:01:31.079> competition<00:01:31.380> I<00:01:31.650> think<00:01:31.680> what<00:01:32.280> about

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490
