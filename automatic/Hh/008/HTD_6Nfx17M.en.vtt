00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480 
won't go into it too much because it's

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:41.510

places<00:00:51.329> it's<00:00:51.510> a<00:00:51.570> very<00:00:51.750> freeing<00:00:52.170> space<00:00:52.710> it's<00:00:53.489> a

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
places it's a very freeing space it's a

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:55.850 
places it's a very freeing space it's a
space<00:00:53.699> where<00:00:54.239> I<00:00:54.660> don't<00:00:55.079> feel<00:00:55.320> like<00:00:55.530> I<00:00:55.559> have<00:00:55.710> to

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860 
space where I don't feel like I have to

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:58.189 
space where I don't feel like I have to
complete<00:00:56.250> any<00:00:56.399> pages<00:00:56.730> so<00:00:57.239> sometimes<00:00:58.020> I've

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
complete any pages so sometimes I've

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:00.020 
complete any pages so sometimes I've
just<00:00:58.350> done<00:00:58.500> a<00:00:58.530> little<00:00:58.590> bit<00:00:58.920> flat<00:00:59.250> ground<00:00:59.579> or

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
just done a little bit flat ground or

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:02.599 
just done a little bit flat ground or
and<00:01:00.390> then<00:01:01.079> left<00:01:01.350> it<00:01:01.620> and<00:01:01.770> then<00:01:01.859> maybe<00:01:02.070> I<00:01:02.280> have

00:01:02.599 --> 00:01:02.609 
and then left it and then maybe I have

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:04.579 
and then left it and then maybe I have
built<00:01:03.030> up<00:01:03.149> a<00:01:03.270> page<00:01:03.480> that<00:01:03.840> actually<00:01:03.930> was<00:01:04.409> a

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
built up a page that actually was a

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:07.039 
built up a page that actually was a
waste<00:01:04.920> stencil<00:01:05.580> page<00:01:06.030> or<00:01:06.299> a<00:01:06.330> waste<00:01:06.540> paint<00:01:06.780> page

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049 
waste stencil page or a waste paint page

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:08.840 
waste stencil page or a waste paint page
something<00:01:07.530> like<00:01:07.710> that

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
something like that
