00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:41.070
 aesthetic palm trees treatment I have never 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:42.899
 I had by the pen black black LIRAa 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:46.070
 When I did very well with great fear but 

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:49.289
 my problem was that the texture of the 

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:51.180
 noise when I looked is half kind 

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:54.660
 a bump I always was I made a 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:57.210

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:59.520

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:01.649
 promised to sing you were not 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:03.780
 enough then made a botox and 

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:05.280
 catanduva dentist were talking at the end 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:07.860
 the afternoon of yesterday 30 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:09.689
 and I would need to use the device because 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:12.000
 they had stolen inside forward 

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:13.860
 but my tooth suggested that it be done 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.320
 a botox did not want for this series is a 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:17.790
 another lion need is we was 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:21.420
 doing this test so you do not have to use 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:24.479
 the device has the chin by hand looks 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:26.460
 know the shape in the fish came back and she 

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:28.560
 has proved that this still gave a 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:33.590
 allergic threat in my mouth that I 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:33.590
 I could then I got 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:39.570
 It was hot with a pateiro there I played 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:42.329
 Who loves to drink from my classes? 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:43.890
 theory of the color of the trio mixed and 

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:46.829
 Today I'm going to show you guys what 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:48.689
 have that reddish purple eye 

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:51.179
 or even people who are born with 

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:57.090
 skin blemishes tutorial for you 

00:01:51.179 --> 00:01:59.039
 explaining that learning there will start 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:01.560
 using my medium high base 

00:01:59.039 --> 00:02:03.390
 coverage off the average but that is 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:05.460
 more proof here with a basis in 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:08.009
 medium hypothesis the coverage will not 

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:09.929
 cover these water, and there was also a mouth 

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:12.120
 cars which avoided the anti management 

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:14.579
 allergy may rain 

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:16.260
 a lot of people asking me to do the 

00:02:14.579 --> 00:02:17.880
 skin preparation video and this is the 

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:20.220
 reason why I have not yet seen that 

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:23.099
 can then bring 

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:24.750
 perry involves in the eye area so I 

00:02:23.099 --> 00:02:26.489
 I am hoping to speak to do a shame to 

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:29.130
 you because this is not the coverage that 

00:02:26.489 --> 00:02:32.130
 they would do it normally so you can see 

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:34.230
 a lot goes on and I got to the 

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:36.090
 make up forever collective that promises 

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:38.700
 hide tattoo but we do not 

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:41.400
 nor does it bounce back when this kind of 

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:43.829
 stain has to use the leather theory already 

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:45.810
 need to use a contrast color and a 

00:02:43.829 --> 00:02:48.329
 color to neutralize this bandit if 

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:50.880
 today is why a color just will not 

00:02:48.329 --> 00:02:52.709
 cover or high cover 47 or not 

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:54.840
 mother several professional crops you 

00:02:52.709 --> 00:02:56.430
 will find several shades 

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:59.069
 then you will need to use this 

00:02:56.430 --> 00:03:00.959
 product but when the correct one is legal 

00:02:59.069 --> 00:03:03.840
 make of your life that will use a lipstick 

00:03:00.959 --> 00:03:06.030
 red and promised meo mate barbie 

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:07.739
 that the but is a limited edition but he 

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:08.370
 is very much like milk identity 

00:03:07.739 --> 00:03:09.900
 mec 

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:11.790
 so it's a red more pulled by 

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:13.709
 orange and I'm going to need my 

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:14.340
 corrective tool 

00:03:13.709 --> 00:03:16.139
 America 

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:18.359
 this law is a hand in the wheel it comes with 

00:03:16.139 --> 00:03:20.549
 six different types of 

00:03:18.359 --> 00:03:21.690
 high coverage so it is great for 

00:03:20.549 --> 00:03:23.430
 work with correction 

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:25.440
 it has four different types of 

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:27.389
 combination of the lightest to the 

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:29.040
 dark and my color and william 

00:03:27.389 --> 00:03:32.730
 now as dense initial or take this 

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:34.650
 warmer color palette unit and 25 and 

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:37.319
 make this mixture with red lipstick on 

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:40.260
 hand reaching for a light rosy 

00:03:37.319 --> 00:03:42.480
 because the pec is clearer mit pitt that is 

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:44.069
 more clarinha and add mix 

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:46.150
 try to make the most of yourself clear 

00:03:44.069 --> 00:03:49.090
 possible 

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:51.040
 with tapping on a brush I 

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:52.629
 I'm applying technically well 

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:54.849
 remembering that this mix also the tone 

00:03:52.629 --> 00:03:56.860
 skin if you lighter darker 

00:03:54.849 --> 00:03:59.290
 you are adopting your skin tone 

00:03:56.860 --> 00:04:05.170
 using the lighter warm tones or 

00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:06.939
 more wife but with smoking brush you 

00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:09.840
 goes to one side and spread the 

00:04:06.939 --> 00:04:12.489
 product but want to wand spot spot 

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:13.989
 then apply a second coat but 

00:04:12.489 --> 00:04:16.120
 very important at home people are 

00:04:13.989 --> 00:04:18.729
 dealing with the eye area or the 

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:20.739
 skin in this very fine part marks a lot 

00:04:18.729 --> 00:04:21.660
 and light hand top as less product 

00:04:20.739 --> 00:04:24.100
 best 

00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:25.570
 now we come with the powder to leave 

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:27.610
 everything in place after we are 

00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:29.500
 dealing with several layers that show the 

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:31.990
 People need to leave every place today. 

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:34.449
 I will use my otÃ¡vio son is also well 

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:36.160
 and it's very clear that you can 

00:04:34.449 --> 00:04:37.720
 use a polo tone of your skin but if you 

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:39.460
 want it to make a highlight if you can 

00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:41.500
 to use the bugle as I studied and sell 

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:43.630
 internally deposits the product with 

00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:45.699
 afterwards we enter the 

00:04:43.630 --> 00:04:49.240
 more yellowish golden tones to 

00:04:45.699 --> 00:04:56.530
 neutralize and deposit the same 

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:58.180
 way with tapping and you can even 

00:04:56.530 --> 00:05:00.430
 to complete the treatment on behalf of 

00:04:58.180 --> 00:05:02.409
 finger but careful what oil stain the 

00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:04.180
 beginning of the difficult period tabulated in 

00:05:02.409 --> 00:05:06.639
 the bottom that I was in the mess 

00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:08.139
 outer ear but finally tries to finish 

00:05:06.639 --> 00:05:09.880
 with touches inside always gives a 

00:05:08.139 --> 00:05:12.210
 more natural finish 

00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:15.760
 and to finish I return with the compact powder 

00:05:12.210 --> 00:05:18.010
 always in these tapping movements or 

00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:19.419
 rolling the drive brush despite 

00:05:18.010 --> 00:05:22.240
 Pedro that will exchange all our 

00:05:19.419 --> 00:05:23.740
 policy we have created and if you want 

00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:25.389
 that your makeup paint denies having 

00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:27.460
 sure you will not leave the place you 

00:05:25.389 --> 00:05:29.380
 you can use make-up fixative and 

00:05:27.460 --> 00:05:31.690
 especially in those areas such as the sacred 

00:05:29.380 --> 00:05:33.580
 but I do not always use the other regions 

00:05:31.690 --> 00:05:38.340
 this is the result she kept was 

00:05:33.580 --> 00:05:41.880
 ball the way it is 

00:05:38.340 --> 00:05:48.230
 explain I came back to me it was 62 

00:05:41.880 --> 00:05:48.230
 they exchanged verified falls in the river
