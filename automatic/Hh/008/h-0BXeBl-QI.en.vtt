not really high quality the package
right<00:04:31.400> here<00:04:31.460> is<00:04:31.820> like<00:04:32.030> feels<00:04:32.960> like<00:04:33.020> it's<00:04:33.440> just

00:04:33.670 --> 00:04:33.680 
right here is like feels like it's just

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:39.159 
right here is like feels like it's just
thin<00:04:34.130> paper<00:04:36.130> there<00:04:37.130> so<00:04:37.400> the<00:04:37.729> two<00:04:38.330> disc<00:04:38.630> which

00:04:39.159 --> 00:04:39.169 
thin paper there so the two disc which

00:04:39.169 --> 00:04:42.129 
thin paper there so the two disc which
is<00:04:39.199> the<00:04:39.530> live<00:04:39.740> concert<00:04:40.130> and<00:04:40.580> the<00:04:40.789> making<00:04:41.150> box<00:04:41.990> I

00:04:42.129 --> 00:04:42.139 
is the live concert and the making box I

00:04:42.139 --> 00:04:45.820 
is the live concert and the making box I
angle<00:04:42.590> video<00:04:42.949> and<00:04:43.960> I<00:04:44.960> believe<00:04:45.229> in<00:04:45.380> watch<00:04:45.590> our

00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:45.830 
angle video and I believe in watch our

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:48.580 
angle video and I believe in watch our
angle<00:04:46.220> video<00:04:46.490> consists<00:04:47.150> of<00:04:47.210> go<00:04:47.539> away<00:04:47.599> of<00:04:48.110> for

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:48.590 
angle video consists of go away of for

00:04:48.590 --> 00:04:52.300 
angle video consists of go away of for
before<00:04:49.310> girls<00:04:49.639> and<00:04:50.509> the<00:04:51.500> live<00:04:51.650> concert<00:04:51.949> is

00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:52.310 
before girls and the live concert is

00:04:52.310 --> 00:05:13.420 
before girls and the live concert is
basically<00:04:52.729> the<00:04:52.940> live<00:04:53.120> concert<00:05:09.789> poster<00:05:12.430> I'd

00:05:13.420 --> 00:05:13.430 
basically the live concert poster I'd

00:05:13.430 --> 00:05:15.879 
basically the live concert poster I'd
haven't<00:05:13.820> seen<00:05:14.000> the<00:05:14.120> poster<00:05:14.449> so<00:05:14.840> I<00:05:15.199> hope<00:05:15.710> it's

00:05:15.879 --> 00:05:15.889 
haven't seen the poster so I hope it's

00:05:15.889 --> 00:05:35.529 
haven't seen the poster so I hope it's
not<00:05:16.039> the<00:05:16.220> one<00:05:30.430> I<00:05:31.810> can't<00:05:32.810> even<00:05:32.900> get<00:05:34.210> find<00:05:35.210> this

00:05:35.529 --> 00:05:35.539 
not the one I can't even get find this

00:05:35.539 --> 00:05:37.719 
not the one I can't even get find this
because<00:05:36.169> it's<00:05:36.320> folded<00:05:36.860> I<00:05:37.070> should<00:05:37.490> have<00:05:37.580> got

00:05:37.719 --> 00:05:37.729 
because it's folded I should have got

00:05:37.729 --> 00:05:40.570 
because it's folded I should have got
the<00:05:37.940> unfolded<00:05:38.539> one<00:05:38.770> but<00:05:39.770> I<00:05:39.800> really<00:05:40.099> like<00:05:40.310> this
