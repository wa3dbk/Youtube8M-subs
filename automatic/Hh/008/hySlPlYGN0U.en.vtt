and<00:03:50.849> I<00:03:50.909> think<00:03:51.090> if<00:03:51.180> you<00:03:51.299> get<00:03:51.510> away<00:03:51.629> with<00:03:51.900> it<00:03:52.019> he

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:52.170 
and I think if you get away with it he

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:54.349 
and I think if you get away with it he
would<00:03:52.349> follow<00:03:52.500> through<00:03:52.920> but<00:03:53.549> I<00:03:53.579> think<00:03:54.180> that

00:03:54.349 --> 00:03:54.359 
would follow through but I think that

00:03:54.359 --> 00:03:57.020 
would follow through but I think that
the<00:03:54.540> people<00:03:54.840> that<00:03:55.139> Jay<00:03:55.440> Leno<00:03:55.680> might<00:03:56.010> say<00:03:56.340> we

00:03:57.020 --> 00:03:57.030 
the people that Jay Leno might say we

00:03:57.030 --> 00:03:58.490 
the people that Jay Leno might say we
don't<00:03:57.150> we<00:03:57.359> rather<00:03:57.540> you<00:03:57.720> didn't<00:03:57.959> do<00:03:58.049> that<00:03:58.079> do

00:03:58.490 --> 00:03:58.500 
don't we rather you didn't do that do

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:00.979 
don't we rather you didn't do that do
you<00:03:58.560> think<00:03:58.739> or<00:03:59.280> all<00:03:59.459> know<00:03:59.669> it<00:03:59.910> never<00:04:00.329> has<00:04:00.720> to<00:04:00.870> do

00:04:00.979 --> 00:04:00.989 
you think or all know it never has to do

00:04:00.989 --> 00:04:03.799
