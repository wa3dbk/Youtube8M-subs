00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:04.200 
other all the good ingredients so I
think<00:02:02.080> this<00:02:02.500> is<00:02:02.560> very<00:02:02.710> effective<00:02:03.310> why<00:02:04.000> would

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:04.210 
think this is very effective why would

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:05.790 
think this is very effective why would
you<00:02:04.300> put<00:02:04.479> some<00:02:04.660> chemical<00:02:05.140> in<00:02:05.229> that<00:02:05.410> when<00:02:05.590> we're

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:05.800 
you put some chemical in that when we're

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:08.999 
you put some chemical in that when we're
getting<00:02:06.100> so<00:02:06.430> much<00:02:07.320> environmental<00:02:08.320> stress

00:02:08.999 --> 00:02:09.009 
getting so much environmental stress

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:11.310 
getting so much environmental stress
from<00:02:09.220> all<00:02:09.459> those<00:02:09.670> chemical<00:02:10.119> going<00:02:10.479> on<00:02:10.630> so<00:02:11.290> I

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:11.320 
from all those chemical going on so I

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:12.840 
from all those chemical going on so I
would<00:02:11.590> definitely<00:02:11.980> recommend<00:02:12.070> the<00:02:12.490> mineral

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:12.850 
would definitely recommend the mineral

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:15.720 
would definitely recommend the mineral
peel<00:02:13.060> to<00:02:13.240> everybody
