00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:09.510 
block and got the light tower again they

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:11.360 
block and got the light tower again they
got<00:00:09.660> this<00:00:09.809> a<00:00:09.870> headlamp<00:00:10.349> on<00:00:10.710> their<00:00:10.950> safety

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:11.370 
got this a headlamp on their safety

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:13.490 
got this a headlamp on their safety
vests<00:00:11.610> whites<00:00:12.420> are<00:00:12.630> a<00:00:12.660> little<00:00:12.809> bit<00:00:12.900> harder<00:00:13.349> at

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:13.500 
vests whites are a little bit harder at

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:15.829 
vests whites are a little bit harder at
night<00:00:13.710> because<00:00:14.009> again<00:00:14.519> of<00:00:14.730> the<00:00:14.820> contrast<00:00:15.480> of

00:00:15.829 --> 00:00:15.839 
night because again of the contrast of

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:18.439 
night because again of the contrast of
Reds<00:00:16.770> with<00:00:17.100> the<00:00:17.220> green<00:00:17.430> leaves<00:00:17.699> is<00:00:18.029> one<00:00:18.210> thing

00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:18.449 
Reds with the green leaves is one thing

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:20.120 
Reds with the green leaves is one thing
but<00:00:18.630> when<00:00:18.750> you've<00:00:18.930> got<00:00:18.960> whites<00:00:19.470> with<00:00:19.800> green

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:20.130 
but when you've got whites with green

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:23.150 
but when you've got whites with green
leaves<00:00:20.369> it's<00:00:20.699> a<00:00:20.850> much<00:00:21.119> harder<00:00:21.449> contrast<00:00:22.230> so<00:00:23.070> it

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:23.160 
leaves it's a much harder contrast so it

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:25.460 
leaves it's a much harder contrast so it
takes<00:00:23.369> a<00:00:23.519> little<00:00:23.730> bit<00:00:23.820> more<00:00:24.090> effort<00:00:24.330> to<00:00:24.810> focus

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:25.470 
takes a little bit more effort to focus

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:27.529 
takes a little bit more effort to focus
on<00:00:25.890> what<00:00:26.099> they're<00:00:26.340> doing<00:00:26.789> and<00:00:27.000> making<00:00:27.240> sure

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:27.539 
on what they're doing and making sure

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:29.480 
on what they're doing and making sure
they<00:00:27.689> pick<00:00:27.900> up<00:00:28.019> all<00:00:28.199> the<00:00:28.320> fruit<00:00:28.590> even<00:00:29.039> from<00:00:29.310> the

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:29.490 
they pick up all the fruit even from the

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:32.749 
they pick up all the fruit even from the
floor<00:00:30.179> and<00:00:30.510> or<00:00:30.929> from<00:00:31.260> the<00:00:31.380> vine<00:00:31.619> so<00:00:32.040> we<00:00:32.579> have<00:00:32.730> a

00:00:32.749 --> 00:00:32.759 
floor and or from the vine so we have a

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:35.120 
floor and or from the vine so we have a
better<00:00:33.090> monitoring<00:00:33.780> system<00:00:34.350> here<00:00:34.590> monitors

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:35.130 
better monitoring system here monitors

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:36.799 
better monitoring system here monitors
being<00:00:35.399> those<00:00:35.640> that<00:00:35.850> kind<00:00:36.030> of<00:00:36.090> walk<00:00:36.300> behind<00:00:36.510> the

00:00:36.799 --> 00:00:36.809 
being those that kind of walk behind the

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:37.510 
being those that kind of walk behind the
bucket

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:37.520 
bucket

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:40.190 
bucket
making<00:00:38.520> sure<00:00:38.550> nothing's<00:00:39.180> miss<00:00:39.540> that<00:00:39.840> the<00:00:40.020> guys

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:40.200 
making sure nothing's miss that the guys

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:42.319 
making sure nothing's miss that the guys
are<00:00:40.469> essentially<00:00:41.280> getting<00:00:41.460> all<00:00:41.879> the<00:00:42.120> fruit

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:42.329 
are essentially getting all the fruit

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:44.270 
are essentially getting all the fruit
harvested<00:00:43.110> and<00:00:43.350> put<00:00:43.559> into<00:00:43.739> the<00:00:43.890> half<00:00:44.070> ton

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 
harvested and put into the half ton

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:47.660 
harvested and put into the half ton
boxes<00:00:44.840> so<00:00:45.840> it's<00:00:46.140> a<00:00:46.379> little<00:00:47.129> bit<00:00:47.219> more<00:00:47.399> of<00:00:47.550> a

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
boxes so it's a little bit more of a

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:49.910 
boxes so it's a little bit more of a
support<00:00:48.180> system<00:00:48.719> but<00:00:48.930> it's<00:00:49.289> an<00:00:49.469> effective

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 
support system but it's an effective

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:52.189 
support system but it's an effective
system<00:00:50.480> the<00:00:51.480> vineyard<00:00:51.750> floor<00:00:51.930> is<00:00:52.050> a<00:00:52.110> little

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199 
system the vineyard floor is a little

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:55.220 
system the vineyard floor is a little
weedy<00:00:52.649> but<00:00:53.219> it's<00:00:53.610> not<00:00:53.789> a<00:00:53.820> huge<00:00:54.239> problem<00:00:54.750> for

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230 
weedy but it's not a huge problem for

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:57.260 
weedy but it's not a huge problem for
the<00:00:55.530> guys<00:00:55.680> they<00:00:55.980> can<00:00:56.160> see<00:00:56.370> pretty<00:00:56.579> well<00:00:56.699> as<00:00:57.059> you

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:57.270 
the guys they can see pretty well as you

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:00.349 
the guys they can see pretty well as you
can<00:00:57.420> tell<00:00:57.629> with<00:00:57.840> the<00:00:58.020> light<00:00:58.550> it's<00:00:59.550> very<00:00:59.730> open

00:01:00.349 --> 00:01:00.359 
can tell with the light it's very open

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:05.469 
can tell with the light it's very open
very<00:01:00.420> visual<00:01:01.170> wide<00:01:01.890> rows<00:01:02.270> easy<00:01:03.270> to<00:01:03.660> navigate

00:01:05.469 --> 00:01:05.479 
very visual wide rows easy to navigate

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:08.840 
very visual wide rows easy to navigate
even<00:01:06.479> for<00:01:06.900> the<00:01:06.990> amount<00:01:07.260> of<00:01:07.380> leaves<00:01:07.710> that<00:01:08.640> are

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
even for the amount of leaves that are

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:10.760 
even for the amount of leaves that are
coming<00:01:09.150> off<00:01:09.270> with<00:01:09.510> the<00:01:09.630> clusters<00:01:10.229> into<00:01:10.680> the

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
coming off with the clusters into the

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:13.580 
coming off with the clusters into the
pans<00:01:11.310> virtually<00:01:12.299> everybody<00:01:13.020> go<00:01:13.200> into<00:01:13.470> their

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
pans virtually everybody go into their

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:15.740 
pans virtually everybody go into their
pans<00:01:13.890> and<00:01:14.100> pick<00:01:14.280> out<00:01:14.460> the<00:01:14.670> leaf<00:01:14.909> leaves<00:01:15.420> or

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
pans and pick out the leaf leaves or

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:18.380 
pans and pick out the leaf leaves or
leaf<00:01:15.960> fragments<00:01:16.680> as<00:01:16.799> much<00:01:16.979> as<00:01:17.159> possible<00:01:17.729> so

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
leaf fragments as much as possible so

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:20.300 
leaf fragments as much as possible so
virtually<00:01:18.840> there's<00:01:19.080> no<00:01:19.290> leaves<00:01:19.590> going<00:01:20.040> to<00:01:20.159> the

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
virtually there's no leaves going to the

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:23.090 
virtually there's no leaves going to the
winery<00:01:20.610> and<00:01:21.360> yes<00:01:22.170> it<00:01:22.350> is<00:01:22.500> a<00:01:22.530> little<00:01:22.799> extra

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
winery and yes it is a little extra

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:25.039 
winery and yes it is a little extra
effort<00:01:23.250> to<00:01:23.670> reach<00:01:24.090> in<00:01:24.299> there<00:01:24.450> and<00:01:24.509> grab<00:01:24.659> four

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:25.049 
effort to reach in there and grab four

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:26.600 
effort to reach in there and grab four
leaves<00:01:25.200> but<00:01:25.439> the<00:01:25.470> guys<00:01:25.740> are<00:01:25.950> not<00:01:26.100> getting<00:01:26.220> paid

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610 
leaves but the guys are not getting paid

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:28.730 
leaves but the guys are not getting paid
for<00:01:26.670> leaves<00:01:27.180> they're<00:01:27.960> getting<00:01:28.170> paid<00:01:28.350> for<00:01:28.619> the

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740 
for leaves they're getting paid for the

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:31.969 
for leaves they're getting paid for the
fruit<00:01:29.070> so<00:01:29.850> it's<00:01:30.270> up<00:01:30.570> to<00:01:30.630> them<00:01:31.020> to<00:01:31.320> really<00:01:31.590> try

fruit so it's up to them to really try

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:35.330 
fruit so it's up to them to really try
to<00:01:32.040> self<00:01:32.430> monitor<00:01:33.119> and<00:01:34.020> regulate<00:01:34.439> the<00:01:34.890> leaving

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 
to self monitor and regulate the leaving

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:36.859 
to self monitor and regulate the leaving
thing<00:01:35.549> yeah<00:01:35.729> a<00:01:35.759> few<00:01:36.060> leaves<00:01:36.240> are<00:01:36.479> always<00:01:36.630> going

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:36.869 
thing yeah a few leaves are always going

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:39.109 
thing yeah a few leaves are always going
to<00:01:36.960> be<00:01:37.020> acceptable<00:01:37.500> but<00:01:37.799> not<00:01:37.860> wads<00:01:38.579> of<00:01:38.880> leaves

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:39.119 
to be acceptable but not wads of leaves

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:42.469 
to be acceptable but not wads of leaves
so<00:01:39.509> it's<00:01:40.439> always<00:01:40.770> very<00:01:41.549> interesting<00:01:41.700> to<00:01:42.210> see

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:42.479 
so it's always very interesting to see

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:44.060 
so it's always very interesting to see
that<00:01:42.689> nobody's<00:01:43.020> yelling<00:01:43.200> at<00:01:43.530> them<00:01:43.680> for<00:01:43.860> leaves

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.070 
that nobody's yelling at them for leaves

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:46.999 
that nobody's yelling at them for leaves
or<00:01:44.520> for<00:01:45.329> things<00:01:45.750> other<00:01:46.020> than<00:01:46.229> grapes<00:01:46.649> we<00:01:46.860> call

in the form of a gypsum and you can see

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:55.970 
in the form of a gypsum and you can see
it's<00:02:54.780> pretty<00:02:55.019> pronounced<00:02:55.620> throughout<00:02:55.829> the

union that hampers the ripening process

00:02:58.130 --> 00:03:00.500 
union that hampers the ripening process
what<00:02:59.130> I<00:02:59.160> mean<00:02:59.430> by<00:02:59.549> that<00:02:59.579> it<00:03:00.000> slows<00:03:00.329> the

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:00.510 
what I mean by that it slows the

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:02.420 
what I mean by that it slows the
ripening<00:03:00.930> process<00:03:00.989> down<00:03:01.769> if<00:03:02.040> there's<00:03:02.250> not<00:03:02.370> a

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:02.430 
ripening process down if there's not a

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:05.660 
ripening process down if there's not a
sufficient<00:03:03.150> amount<00:03:03.239> of<00:03:03.569> potassium<00:03:04.519> it<00:03:05.519> could

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:05.670 
sufficient amount of potassium it could

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:08.030 
sufficient amount of potassium it could
be<00:03:05.760> corrected<00:03:06.239> by<00:03:06.900> applying<00:03:07.349> potassium

00:03:56.640 --> 00:03:56.650 
the openness of the canopy and the

00:03:56.650 --> 00:03:59.789 
the openness of the canopy and the
openness<00:03:57.099> of<00:03:57.310> the<00:03:57.370> clusters<00:03:58.409> in<00:03:59.409> other<00:03:59.560> words

00:03:59.789 --> 00:03:59.799 
openness of the clusters in other words

00:03:59.799 --> 00:04:02.339 
openness of the clusters in other words
the<00:03:59.980> berries<00:04:00.340> are<00:04:00.519> not<00:04:00.700> really<00:04:01.090> very<00:04:01.810> tight<00:04:02.140> in

00:04:02.339 --> 00:04:02.349 
the berries are not really very tight in

00:04:02.349 --> 00:04:04.289 
the berries are not really very tight in
these<00:04:02.530> clusters<00:04:03.010> it<00:04:03.609> allowed<00:04:03.879> the<00:04:04.060> rainwater

00:04:04.289 --> 00:04:04.299 
these clusters it allowed the rainwater

00:04:04.299 --> 00:04:06.660 
these clusters it allowed the rainwater
to<00:04:04.780> actually<00:04:05.079> go<00:04:05.230> on<00:04:05.439> through<00:04:05.950> the<00:04:06.189> berries

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:06.670 
to actually go on through the berries

00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:10.140 
to actually go on through the berries
and<00:04:08.069> therefore<00:04:09.069> we<00:04:09.219> don't<00:04:09.370> have<00:04:09.519> to<00:04:09.730> worry

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:10.150 
and therefore we don't have to worry

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:12.449 
and therefore we don't have to worry
about<00:04:10.420> the<00:04:10.629> risk<00:04:10.840> of<00:04:11.109> rot<00:04:11.439> happening<00:04:12.250> and

00:04:12.449 --> 00:04:12.459 
about the risk of rot happening and

00:04:12.459 --> 00:04:14.280 
about the risk of rot happening and
that's<00:04:12.969> not<00:04:13.239> the<00:04:13.389> reason<00:04:13.659> why<00:04:13.689> we're<00:04:13.959> picking

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:14.290 
that's not the reason why we're picking

00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:16.020 
that's not the reason why we're picking
today<00:04:14.500> that<00:04:14.709> it<00:04:14.920> was<00:04:15.069> on<00:04:15.219> the<00:04:15.340> schedule<00:04:15.579> prior

00:04:16.020 --> 00:04:16.030 
today that it was on the schedule prior

00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:18.870 
today that it was on the schedule prior
to<00:04:16.329> the<00:04:16.449> rain<00:04:16.690> event<00:04:17.109> the<00:04:17.919> forecasters<00:04:18.699> had

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:18.880 
to the rain event the forecasters had

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:20.909 
to the rain event the forecasters had
said<00:04:19.150> we'd<00:04:19.299> get<00:04:19.509> between<00:04:19.870> a<00:04:19.989> tenth<00:04:20.590> to<00:04:20.829> a

00:04:20.909 --> 00:04:20.919 
said we'd get between a tenth to a

00:04:20.919 --> 00:04:22.140 
said we'd get between a tenth to a
quarter<00:04:21.130> inch<00:04:21.310> and<00:04:21.669> it<00:04:21.729> turned<00:04:21.910> out<00:04:21.970> to<00:04:22.120> be

00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:22.150 
quarter inch and it turned out to be

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:25.620 
quarter inch and it turned out to be
more<00:04:22.539> than<00:04:22.660> 3/4<00:04:23.380> of<00:04:23.410> an<00:04:23.650> inch<00:04:23.770> of<00:04:24.009> rain<00:04:24.630> but

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:25.630 
more than 3/4 of an inch of rain but

00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:27.990 
more than 3/4 of an inch of rain but
again<00:04:25.990> the<00:04:26.229> point<00:04:26.440> is<00:04:26.680> at<00:04:26.919> the<00:04:26.949> cause<00:04:27.220> of<00:04:27.370> the

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:28.000 
again the point is at the cause of the

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.150 
again the point is at the cause of the
clusters<00:04:28.419> are<00:04:28.449> open<00:04:29.050> they're<00:04:29.380> small<00:04:29.800> the

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:30.160 
clusters are open they're small the

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:31.920 
clusters are open they're small the
Chardonnay<00:04:30.460> is<00:04:30.759> very<00:04:30.970> small<00:04:31.270> clusters

00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:31.930 
Chardonnay is very small clusters

00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:34.980 
Chardonnay is very small clusters
because<00:04:32.830> of<00:04:33.130> the<00:04:33.220> clone<00:04:33.550> and<00:04:33.849> the<00:04:34.479> openness<00:04:34.840> of

00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:34.990 
because of the clone and the openness of

00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:37.170 
because of the clone and the openness of
