countries we are in Saudi Arabia our the

00:01:30.259 --> 00:01:34.100 
countries we are in Saudi Arabia our the
the<00:01:31.259> women<00:01:31.500> are<00:01:31.680> are<00:01:32.369> too<00:01:32.640> much<00:01:32.850> and<00:01:33.150> they<00:01:33.960> are

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110 
the women are are too much and they are

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:37.550 
the women are are too much and they are
they<00:01:34.590> don't<00:01:34.799> work<00:01:35.070> so<00:01:35.869> this<00:01:36.869> is<00:01:37.049> a<00:01:37.079> very<00:01:37.380> big

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
they don't work so this is a very big

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:40.160 
they don't work so this is a very big
problem<00:01:38.159> because<00:01:38.520> it<00:01:38.939> cannot<00:01:39.150> depend<00:01:39.540> only<00:01:39.990> on

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:40.170 
problem because it cannot depend only on

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:44.120 
problem because it cannot depend only on
on<00:01:40.890> men<00:01:41.189> who<00:01:41.970> are<00:01:42.210> and<00:01:42.840> in<00:01:43.259> my<00:01:43.439> opinion<00:01:43.619> I<00:01:44.100> think

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
on men who are and in my opinion I think

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:46.039 
on men who are and in my opinion I think
that<00:01:44.549> women<00:01:44.909> if<00:01:45.060> they<00:01:45.240> work<00:01:45.509> they<00:01:45.780> are<00:01:45.869> much

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:46.049 
that women if they work they are much

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:49.730 
that women if they work they are much
stronger<00:01:46.380> than<00:01:46.640> than<00:01:47.640> men<00:01:47.850> and<00:01:48.380> they<00:01:49.380> can<00:01:49.590> do<00:01:49.710> a

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:49.740 
stronger than than men and they can do a

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:51.649 
stronger than than men and they can do a
lot<00:01:49.950> of<00:01:50.100> things<00:01:50.369> because<00:01:50.700> they<00:01:51.450> know<00:01:51.630> that

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:51.659
