00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:05.319
 hi friends from youtube I come to bring you 

00:00:02.920 --> 00:00:08.220
 a video of something I did in 

00:00:05.319 --> 00:00:12.700
 minecraft and prepare to see the entrance 

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:15.410
 if a baseball stadium we keep watching 

00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:19.730
 obviously I did it with the creative 

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:22.130
 this here is entered and that's why 

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:23.509
 he's a little sick here he buys 

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:25.939
 Shirt 

00:00:23.509 --> 00:00:27.700
 the favor and shirt of your team 

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:30.170

00:00:30.170 --> 00:00:33.540

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:38.430
 uy uy 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:43.160
 let's continue seeing what else is the field 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:45.110
 this here the field is centered 

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:46.770
 as you can see a field I did it 

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:49.780
 same 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:50.250
 these are the ones granted where is the 

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:52.990
 team 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:57.580
 here the color of the uniform with which 

00:00:52.990 --> 00:00:59.590
 want to play can choose any and 

00:00:57.580 --> 00:01:01.570
 there is the other one of gaudÃ­ 

00:00:59.590 --> 00:01:04.330
 explaining a little more of this from the 

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:06.370
 positions for what they do not know this 

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:08.950
 here you put the batter you keep right 

00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:11.950
 or if he is left-handed 

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:13.810
 here they put the catcher or receiver is 

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:16.750
 the manager receives a ball from 

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:18.460
 pitcher and here back up in the valleys 

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:19.630
 that has been in charge of marking is good 

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:22.000
 strike 

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:24.320
 here the picture is mounted for obviously 

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:28.510
 file 

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:32.060
 this is the first basis that the 

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:34.009
 batter aims to get here 

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:37.310
 is here you can take care first the 

00:01:34.009 --> 00:01:39.780
 first base the one that the second 

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:43.560
 who cares second gets here 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:44.940
 but the third one is the right one that 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:47.700
 intermediate position between second and 

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:49.690
 third is here and the third base plays 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:52.300
 stuck in the third 

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:54.820
 this is the line where the ball does not 

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:58.360
 you can pass if you pass will be marked as 

00:01:54.820 --> 00:02:00.900
 foul and this will automatically be the 

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:05.290
 gardens here is where you put the 

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:07.540
 gardener les filder here the gardener 

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:09.600
 central that is the one that has more space 

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:13.580
 for running 

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:13.580
 and here is the king filder 

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:21.319
 Then be explaining a little more 

00:02:19.609 --> 00:02:22.990
 batter has to make contact with the 

00:02:21.319 --> 00:02:26.220
 ball 

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:29.190
 so the ball can pay 

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:31.590
 it's a good one if the batter does this and 

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:34.530
 the ball goes is a home run that are 

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:36.810
 automatically a race and if there 

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:39.050
 man on base is that that career 

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:39.050
 as well 

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:44.090
 but the goal of the defenders is 

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:47.640
 prevent the ball from passing or falling 

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:51.019
 doing this looking for the ball 

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:55.280
 and they have to catch him 

00:02:51.019 --> 00:02:55.280
 the player automatically out 

00:02:55.850 --> 00:03:00.620
 he said do this because here in my 

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:04.100
 country is like sport 

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:07.280
 saying already in Spain that is football 

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:09.560
 this my country venezuela then I 

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:14.300
 He also practiced this sport and for 

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:16.010
 here in the sport king is explaining 

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:20.090
 a little more this is the blackboard where 

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:21.860
 noticed in the following this first and the 

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:24.560
 second inning third inning room 

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:28.430
 inning fifth sixth seventh 

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:30.860
 ninth the games are played 19 and if there 

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:33.230
 ties will continue to follow inning 

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:35.480
 until it's over until someone 

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:38.690
 make the race then I deumm you and so 

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:40.990
 I do not think the eye error and the 

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:40.990
 careers 

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:45.849
