 Spacecraft had broken up the us research satellite UARS is after 

00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:13.309
 Data from the NASA space agency crashed uncontrollably in the morning 

00:00:13.309 --> 00:00:16.640
 Police on Earth declared the authority in Cape Canaveral 

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:20.369
 one of them may be taken in Canada

 the tablet the size of a school bus was in a time slot 

00:00:23.339 --> 00:00:27.489
 between 5 23 and 7 09 Central European Time above the

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:43.079
 the space agency should have met parts on land and the

 Emphasis is on if ladies are probably on Canadian 

00:00:45.879 --> 00:00:49.940
 Territory in the said time window acted the song Canada parts of Africa 

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:53.949
 and large areas of the Atlantic Ocean of the Pacific and the Indian Ocean 

00:00:53.949 --> 00:00:58.859
 According to European Space Agency data, this club probably flew over

 about 90 percent of the bus-sized device connects that said her spokesman 

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:06.190
 Bernhard von Weyhe he estimated in Darmstadt are 20 to 25 fragments 

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:10.870
 his operation remained the ETA had previously informed the sales was against 

00:01:10.869 --> 00:01:14.720
 Fekter 20 Central European time crashed extremely low risk for 

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:18.659
 People are unpredictable factors such as solar storms and the crude movement 

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:21.280
 Peter's loved ones had accurate predictions 

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:24.070
 over shooting time and offered more difficult 

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:27.960
 so NASA it assumes that in the ten by three feet and round

 when entering the earth's atmosphere do not completely burn up 10 

00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:41.909
 At the same time, gram fat authority that is just an extremely low risk for 

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:43.240
 Give people 

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:46.450
 to be hit by satellites the probability that one of the seven 

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:50.100
 Billions of people on Earth are hit by the debris 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:53.700
 is therefore at zero point zero 3 percent, according to a 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:58.350
 NASA specialists have never entered space travel history in more than 50 years
