 the subscriber who watched me and he 

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:53.359
 said that they put evil, I again became 

00:00:51.409 --> 00:00:55.309
 too much zadroty and decided to score 

00:00:53.359 --> 00:00:57.949
 on clash is more accurate not to score on clash 

00:00:55.309 --> 00:01:00.019
 more precisely throw a clichÃ© and 

00:00:57.949 --> 00:01:02.629

00:01:02.629 --> 00:01:07.549
 I didn't have enough gras for a clash prize 

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:11.630
 because I thought that gems are already 

00:01:07.549 --> 00:01:15.619
 beaten beaten like a reward for over 

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:17.689
 winning the clash channel competition yes i 

00:01:15.619 --> 00:01:22.070

 The account of the sleeve will be played already 

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:36.649
 less well as less by 50 probably where 

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:40.549

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:42.020
 defense here in 1834 that is held 34 

00:01:40.549 --> 00:01:44.450

00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:34.050
 from plans because on polima stream 

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:34.580
 you allowed one clan missing 

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:37.050

00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:15.470
 has been spent since the beginning of the game also here 

00:05:13.380 --> 00:05:17.460
 saved stones that are are 

00:05:15.470 --> 00:05:19.410
 the attraction of these cool 

00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:21.330
 accounts real there is a lot of things 

00:05:19.410 --> 00:05:24.540

00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:27.000
 I really like it here as well 

00:05:24.540 --> 00:05:29.010
 can you try to get to 

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:30.780
