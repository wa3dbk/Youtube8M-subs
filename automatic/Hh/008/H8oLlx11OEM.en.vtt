this<00:00:11.920> is<00:00:12.130> the<00:00:12.519> concept<00:00:13.000> that<00:00:13.179> we<00:00:13.360> call<00:00:13.389> the

00:00:13.709 --> 00:00:13.719 
this is the concept that we call the

00:00:13.719 --> 00:00:17.460 
this is the concept that we call the
portable<00:00:14.260> studio<00:00:15.750> when<00:00:16.750> I<00:00:16.779> started<00:00:17.200> in<00:00:17.349> this

portable studio when I started in this
business<00:00:17.740> a<00:00:18.160> documentary<00:00:19.060> team<00:00:19.860> had<00:00:20.860> many

business a documentary team had many

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:26.700 
business a documentary team had many
people<00:00:21.720> today<00:00:22.720> very<00:00:22.930> often<00:00:23.400> the<00:00:24.400> same<00:00:24.669> work<00:00:25.710> is

00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:26.710 
people today very often the same work is

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:30.569 
people today very often the same work is
done<00:00:27.099> by<00:00:27.340> two<00:00:27.399> people<00:00:28.380> sometimes<00:00:29.380> one<00:00:30.279> behind

00:00:30.569 --> 00:00:30.579 
done by two people sometimes one behind

00:00:30.579 --> 00:00:32.760 
done by two people sometimes one behind
the<00:00:30.820> camera<00:00:30.849> and<00:00:31.450> one<00:00:32.169> in<00:00:32.290> front<00:00:32.500> of<00:00:32.649> the

00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:32.770 
the camera and one in front of the

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:35.800 
camera and that makes for an acute lack

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:40.740 
camera and that makes for an acute lack
of<00:00:36.070> hands<00:00:36.579> and<00:00:37.500> most<00:00:38.910> they<00:00:39.910> also<00:00:40.360> compounded

00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:40.750 
of hands and most they also compounded

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:45.540 
of hands and most they also compounded
by<00:00:41.200> a<00:00:41.230> lack<00:00:41.500> of<00:00:41.680> time<00:00:42.010> and<00:00:42.399> money<00:00:43.739> and<00:00:44.739> how<00:00:45.489> can

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:45.550 
by a lack of time and money and how can

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:48.779 
by a lack of time and money and how can
you<00:00:45.760> do<00:00:46.140> reasonably<00:00:47.140> good<00:00:47.410> lighting<00:00:47.789> under

00:00:48.779 --> 00:00:48.789 
you do reasonably good lighting under

00:00:48.789 --> 00:00:52.399 
you do reasonably good lighting under
those<00:00:48.940> conditions<00:00:49.980> so<00:00:50.980> we<00:00:51.280> came<00:00:51.489> up<00:00:51.550> with

00:00:52.399 --> 00:00:52.409 
those conditions so we came up with

00:00:52.409 --> 00:00:57.649 
those conditions so we came up with
lighting<00:00:53.409> kits<00:00:53.739> that<00:00:54.269> are<00:00:55.559> smaller<00:00:56.559> lighter

00:00:57.649 --> 00:00:57.659 
lighting kits that are smaller lighter

00:00:57.659 --> 00:01:02.930 
lighting kits that are smaller lighter
more<00:00:59.159> versatile<00:01:00.159> and<00:01:00.510> still<00:01:01.510> complex<00:01:02.289> enough

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.940 
more versatile and still complex enough

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:08.700 
more versatile and still complex enough
to<00:01:03.940> allow<00:01:04.449> for<00:01:04.930> creative<00:01:05.650> lighting<00:01:07.470> this<00:01:08.470> is<00:01:08.680> a

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:08.710 
to allow for creative lighting this is a

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:12.570 
to allow for creative lighting this is a
mixture<00:01:09.159> of<00:01:09.479> soft<00:01:10.479> lights<00:01:11.010> which<00:01:12.010> can<00:01:12.220> be<00:01:12.370> used

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:12.580 
mixture of soft lights which can be used

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:15.959 
mixture of soft lights which can be used
with<00:01:13.030> small<00:01:13.540> medium<00:01:14.020> or<00:01:14.229> larger<00:01:14.950> soft<00:01:15.460> boxes

00:01:15.959 --> 00:01:15.969 
with small medium or larger soft boxes

00:01:15.969 --> 00:01:20.670 
with small medium or larger soft boxes
and<00:01:17.759> highly<00:01:18.759> precision<00:01:19.600> focusing<00:01:20.409> lights

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:20.680 
and highly precision focusing lights

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:26.039 
and highly precision focusing lights
that<00:01:21.670> allow<00:01:22.000> for<00:01:23.310> very<00:01:24.310> good<00:01:24.520> control<00:01:24.759> of<00:01:25.329> the

00:01:26.039 --> 00:01:26.049 
that allow for very good control of the

00:01:26.049 --> 00:01:30.679 
that allow for very good control of the
backlight<00:01:26.560> a<00:01:27.810> highly<00:01:28.810> controllable<00:01:29.619> kicker

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:34.080 
backlight a highly controllable kicker
that<00:01:31.689> you<00:01:31.810> don't<00:01:31.990> always<00:01:32.170> need<00:01:32.530> and<00:01:32.829> an<00:01:33.729> extra

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:34.090 
that you don't always need and an extra

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:38.880 
that you don't always need and an extra
light<00:01:34.950> for<00:01:35.950> the<00:01:36.399> background<00:01:36.909> and<00:01:37.799> for<00:01:38.799> the

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:38.890 
light for the background and for the

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:40.889 
light for the background and for the
background<00:01:39.070> lighting<00:01:39.729> you<00:01:39.820> can<00:01:39.850> also<00:01:40.149> use<00:01:40.509> a

00:01:40.889 --> 00:01:40.899 
background lighting you can also use a

00:01:40.899 --> 00:01:45.980 
background lighting you can also use a
an<00:01:42.030> imager<00:01:43.030> a<00:01:43.270> projection<00:01:43.869> attachment<00:01:44.770> which

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:45.990 
an imager a projection attachment which

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:50.520 
an imager a projection attachment which
produces<00:01:47.130> background<00:01:48.130> patterns<00:01:49.380> there<00:01:50.380> are

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:50.530 
produces background patterns there are

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:52.529 
produces background patterns there are
300<00:01:51.219> different<00:01:51.640> patterns<00:01:52.030> that<00:01:52.270> you<00:01:52.390> can

00:01:52.529 --> 00:01:52.539 
300 different patterns that you can

00:01:52.539 --> 00:01:55.940 
300 different patterns that you can
choose<00:01:52.750> from<00:01:53.049> or<00:01:53.939> background<00:01:54.939> effect<00:01:55.359> filters

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:55.950 
choose from or background effect filters

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:59.990 
choose from or background effect filters
to<00:01:56.950> make<00:01:57.159> the<00:01:57.640> background<00:01:57.850> more<00:01:58.450> interesting

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.000 
to make the background more interesting

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:05.730 
to make the background more interesting
so<00:02:01.000> let's<00:02:01.899> look<00:02:02.140> at<00:02:02.439> a<00:02:03.270> standard<00:02:04.270> very<00:02:05.259> simple

00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:05.740 
so let's look at a standard very simple

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:09.419 
so let's look at a standard very simple
setup<00:02:06.060> with<00:02:07.060> these<00:02:07.240> kind<00:02:07.539> of<00:02:07.689> lights<00:02:07.929> with<00:02:08.800> a<00:02:08.830> 5

00:02:09.419 --> 00:02:09.429 
setup with these kind of lights with a 5

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:15.300 
setup with these kind of lights with a 5
light<00:02:10.200> system<00:02:11.940> so<00:02:12.940> here<00:02:13.210> we<00:02:13.360> have<00:02:13.540> the<00:02:14.310> key

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:15.310 
light system so here we have the key

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:19.350 
light system so here we have the key
light<00:02:15.580> and<00:02:15.880> here<00:02:16.840> we're<00:02:17.020> using<00:02:17.260> a<00:02:18.360> larger

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:19.360 
light and here we're using a larger

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:24.040 
light and here we're using a larger
softbox<00:02:20.310> to<00:02:21.310> have<00:02:21.459> gentle<00:02:21.940> shadow<00:02:22.390> and<00:02:22.810> light

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:24.050 
softbox to have gentle shadow and light

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:29.590 
softbox to have gentle shadow and light
and<00:02:25.270> we<00:02:26.270> can<00:02:26.450> place<00:02:26.690> that<00:02:28.120> closer<00:02:29.120> to<00:02:29.480> the

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:29.600 
and we can place that closer to the

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:33.880 
and we can place that closer to the
camera<00:02:30.310> but<00:02:31.310> that<00:02:31.460> makes<00:02:31.730> the<00:02:32.710> image<00:02:33.710> look

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:33.890 
camera but that makes the image look

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:39.580 
camera but that makes the image look
more<00:02:34.790> flat<00:02:35.230> that<00:02:36.230> Rob's<00:02:36.530> it<00:02:36.800> of<00:02:37.660> dimension<00:02:38.660> so

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:39.590 
more flat that Rob's it of dimension so

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:43.120 
more flat that Rob's it of dimension so
we<00:02:39.710> explore<00:02:40.130> how<00:02:40.160> far<00:02:41.440> away<00:02:42.440> from<00:02:42.470> the<00:02:42.890> camera

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:43.130 
we explore how far away from the camera

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:47.590 
we explore how far away from the camera
axis<00:02:43.640> we<00:02:43.850> can<00:02:44.030> place<00:02:44.330> the<00:02:44.600> light<00:02:44.780> in<00:02:46.600> sideways

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:47.600 
axis we can place the light in sideways

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:50.980 
axis we can place the light in sideways
direction<00:02:47.900> and<00:02:48.700> also<00:02:49.700> how<00:02:50.030> far<00:02:50.060> can<00:02:50.540> we<00:02:50.660> go<00:02:50.690> up

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:50.990 
direction and also how far can we go up

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:55.260 
direction and also how far can we go up
without<00:02:51.830> losing<00:02:53.050> the<00:02:54.050> reflex<00:02:54.710> in<00:02:54.890> the<00:02:54.920> eye

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:55.270 
without losing the reflex in the eye

00:02:55.270 --> 00:02:57.700 
without losing the reflex in the eye
because<00:02:56.270> that<00:02:56.420> is<00:02:56.540> very<00:02:56.570> important<00:02:57.170> to<00:02:57.290> us<00:02:57.410> and

00:02:57.700 --> 00:02:57.710 
because that is very important to us and

00:02:57.710 --> 00:03:02.290 
because that is very important to us and
at<00:02:58.520> the<00:02:58.640> same<00:02:58.850> time<00:02:59.350> giving<00:03:00.350> the<00:03:00.620> face<00:03:00.970> more<00:03:01.970> of

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:02.300 
at the same time giving the face more of

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:09.850 
at the same time giving the face more of
a<00:03:02.720> dimension<00:03:03.320> more<00:03:04.280> depth<00:03:07.240> next<00:03:08.650> we<00:03:09.650> place

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:09.860 
a dimension more depth next we place

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:14.740 
a dimension more depth next we place
another<00:03:10.580> soft<00:03:10.940> light<00:03:11.210> as<00:03:11.510> a<00:03:12.500> fill<00:03:13.160> light<00:03:13.750> to

00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:14.750 
another soft light as a fill light to

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:18.460 
another soft light as a fill light to
balance<00:03:15.200> the<00:03:15.380> contrast<00:03:15.920> and<00:03:17.350> choosing<00:03:18.350> the

00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:18.470 
balance the contrast and choosing the

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:21.480 
balance the contrast and choosing the
intensity<00:03:19.100> of<00:03:19.190> the<00:03:19.310> fill<00:03:19.550> light<00:03:19.930> makes<00:03:20.930> it

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:21.490 
intensity of the fill light makes it

00:03:21.490 --> 00:03:24.580

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:28.670 
dramatic the next one would be the

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:32.560 
dramatic the next one would be the
backlight<00:03:29.180> and<00:03:30.190> that<00:03:31.190> we<00:03:31.490> place<00:03:31.790> first<00:03:32.180> with<00:03:32.540> a

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:32.570 
backlight and that we place first with a

00:03:32.570 --> 00:03:36.190 
backlight and that we place first with a
focusing<00:03:33.140> light<00:03:33.380> at<00:03:33.680> full<00:03:34.550> power<00:03:34.990> then<00:03:35.990> we

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:36.200 
focusing light at full power then we

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:40.540 
focusing light at full power then we
find<00:03:36.470> out<00:03:36.709> if<00:03:37.370> we<00:03:37.760> want<00:03:38.000> to<00:03:38.209> catch<00:03:39.310> the<00:03:40.310> head

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:40.550 
find out if we want to catch the head

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:43.540 
find out if we want to catch the head
the<00:03:40.910> hair<00:03:41.209> and<00:03:41.510> the<00:03:41.720> shoulders<00:03:42.310> whether<00:03:43.310> that

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:43.550 
the hair and the shoulders whether that

00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:46.890 
the hair and the shoulders whether that
balances<00:03:44.270> maybe<00:03:45.160> somebody<00:03:46.160> has<00:03:46.340> white<00:03:46.580> hair

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:46.900 
balances maybe somebody has white hair

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:52.330 
balances maybe somebody has white hair
then<00:03:47.900> we<00:03:48.170> may<00:03:48.380> want<00:03:48.590> to<00:03:48.740> cut<00:03:49.010> the<00:03:49.880> top<00:03:50.720> a<00:03:51.340> little

00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:52.340 
then we may want to cut the top a little

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:56.220 
then we may want to cut the top a little
bit<00:03:52.520> down<00:03:52.880> we<00:03:53.330> can<00:03:53.510> do<00:03:53.720> that<00:03:53.959> with<00:03:54.350> a<00:03:54.380> barn<00:03:54.740> door

00:03:56.220 --> 00:03:56.230 
bit down we can do that with a barn door

00:03:56.230 --> 00:04:00.190 
bit down we can do that with a barn door
when<00:03:57.230> we<00:03:57.380> want<00:03:57.560> to<00:03:57.650> do<00:03:57.770> that<00:03:57.980> then<00:03:58.540> we<00:03:59.540> focus

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:00.200 
when we want to do that then we focus

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:02.980 
when we want to do that then we focus
the<00:04:00.230> light<00:04:00.590> a<00:04:00.620> little<00:04:00.950> bit<00:04:01.130> closer<00:04:02.120> to<00:04:02.600> medium

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:02.990 
the light a little bit closer to medium

00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:05.590 
the light a little bit closer to medium
and<00:04:03.430> then<00:04:04.430> the<00:04:04.700> barn<00:04:04.970> door<00:04:05.150> edge<00:04:05.330> becomes

00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:05.600 
and then the barn door edge becomes

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:08.680 
and then the barn door edge becomes
quite<00:04:06.320> soft<00:04:06.620> or<00:04:07.010> we<00:04:07.700> can<00:04:07.880> do<00:04:08.000> it<00:04:08.120> with<00:04:08.330> a<00:04:08.360> half

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:08.690 
quite soft or we can do it with a half

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:12.190 
quite soft or we can do it with a half
scrim<00:04:09.290> a<00:04:09.640> wire<00:04:10.640> net<00:04:11.000> that<00:04:11.480> covers<00:04:11.900> the<00:04:12.080> upper

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:12.200 
scrim a wire net that covers the upper

00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:15.400 
scrim a wire net that covers the upper
half<00:04:12.620> of<00:04:12.800> the<00:04:12.950> light<00:04:13.130> to<00:04:14.120> take<00:04:14.630> down<00:04:14.959> the

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:15.410 
half of the light to take down the

00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:20.260 
half of the light to take down the
intensity<00:04:15.800> on<00:04:16.720> the<00:04:17.720> head<00:04:17.930> and<00:04:18.760> leave<00:04:19.760> more<00:04:20.090> on

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:20.270 
intensity on the head and leave more on

00:04:20.270 --> 00:04:22.990 
intensity on the head and leave more on
the<00:04:20.390> shoulders<00:04:20.840> and<00:04:21.669> when<00:04:22.669> we<00:04:22.820> do<00:04:22.970> that

00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:23.000 
the shoulders and when we do that

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:26.080 
the shoulders and when we do that
usually<00:04:23.810> we<00:04:24.050> try<00:04:24.260> to<00:04:24.380> go<00:04:24.650> more<00:04:24.919> to<00:04:25.160> the<00:04:25.340> flood

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:26.090 
usually we try to go more to the flood

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:28.690 
usually we try to go more to the flood
position<00:04:26.780> of<00:04:26.930> the<00:04:27.080> light<00:04:27.260> because<00:04:28.190> then<00:04:28.490> the

00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:28.700 
position of the light because then the

00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:32.770 
position of the light because then the
division<00:04:29.210> between<00:04:29.710> the<00:04:31.060> part<00:04:32.060> with<00:04:32.540> lower

00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:32.780

00:04:34.730 --> 00:04:34.740 
intensity and the part with higher

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:38.300 
intensity and the part with higher
city<00:04:34.949> comes<00:04:35.789> out<00:04:35.970> better<00:04:36.710> then<00:04:37.710> we<00:04:37.860> place<00:04:38.099> the

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:38.310 
city comes out better then we place the

00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:41.659 
city comes out better then we place the
kicker<00:04:38.930> which<00:04:39.930> comes<00:04:40.229> from<00:04:41.039> the<00:04:41.220> opposite

00:04:41.659 --> 00:04:41.669 
kicker which comes from the opposite

00:04:41.669 --> 00:04:46.129 
kicker which comes from the opposite
side<00:04:41.910> of<00:04:42.210> the<00:04:42.630> key<00:04:42.840> light<00:04:42.870> and<00:04:44.150> if<00:04:45.150> we<00:04:45.810> place

00:04:46.129 --> 00:04:46.139 
side of the key light and if we place

00:04:46.139 --> 00:04:50.540 
side of the key light and if we place
that<00:04:47.569> too<00:04:48.569> far<00:04:48.870> out<00:04:49.199> of<00:04:49.259> the<00:04:49.650> camera<00:04:49.979> axis<00:04:50.370> it

00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:50.550 
that too far out of the camera axis it

00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:52.700 
that too far out of the camera axis it
could<00:04:50.759> become<00:04:50.910> dangerous<00:04:51.199> when<00:04:52.199> the<00:04:52.319> person

00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:52.710 
could become dangerous when the person

catches the kicker and causes the
disturbing<00:04:59.610> effects<00:05:00.090> because<00:05:00.479> it's<00:05:00.690> on<00:05:00.930> and

00:05:01.129 --> 00:05:01.139 
disturbing effects because it's on and

00:05:01.139 --> 00:05:03.379 
disturbing effects because it's on and
off<00:05:01.289> and<00:05:01.590> on<00:05:01.680> and<00:05:01.740> off<00:05:02.039> and<00:05:02.340> attracts<00:05:03.120> all<00:05:03.240> the

off and on and off and attracts all the

00:05:03.389 --> 00:05:05.330 
off and on and off and attracts all the
attention<00:05:03.620> so<00:05:04.620> we<00:05:04.650> have<00:05:04.830> to<00:05:04.949> be<00:05:05.099> little

00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:05.340 
attention so we have to be little

00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:05.930 
attention so we have to be little
careful

00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:05.940 
careful

00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:08.270 
careful
the<00:05:06.449> kicker<00:05:06.690> can<00:05:06.990> also<00:05:07.139> be<00:05:07.380> very<00:05:07.590> helpful<00:05:07.919> if

00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:08.280 
the kicker can also be very helpful if

00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:11.570 
the kicker can also be very helpful if
we<00:05:08.400> want<00:05:08.610> to<00:05:08.729> make<00:05:08.940> a<00:05:09.560> rounder<00:05:10.560> face<00:05:10.919> look<00:05:11.430> a

00:05:11.570 --> 00:05:11.580 
we want to make a rounder face look a

00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:17.149 
we want to make a rounder face look a
little<00:05:11.880> bit<00:05:12.169> slimmer<00:05:13.169> and<00:05:14.599> then<00:05:15.889> we<00:05:16.889> still

00:05:17.149 --> 00:05:17.159 
little bit slimmer and then we still

00:05:17.159 --> 00:05:21.770 
little bit slimmer and then we still
have<00:05:18.770> one<00:05:19.770> extra<00:05:20.130> light<00:05:20.490> that<00:05:21.090> we<00:05:21.210> can<00:05:21.389> use<00:05:21.539> for

00:05:21.770 --> 00:05:21.780 
have one extra light that we can use for

00:05:21.780 --> 00:05:24.230 
have one extra light that we can use for
the<00:05:21.870> background<00:05:22.220> either<00:05:23.220> to<00:05:23.759> place<00:05:24.000> it

00:05:24.230 --> 00:05:24.240 
the background either to place it

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:26.089 
the background either to place it
straight<00:05:24.419> onto<00:05:24.810> the<00:05:24.990> background<00:05:25.530> close<00:05:25.830> the

straight onto the background close the
barn<00:05:26.340> doors<00:05:26.659> create<00:05:27.659> a<00:05:27.780> strip<00:05:28.289> of<00:05:28.319> light<00:05:29.720> which

00:05:30.710 --> 00:05:30.720 
barn doors create a strip of light which

00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:32.629 
barn doors create a strip of light which
usually<00:05:31.020> looks<00:05:31.620> a<00:05:31.770> little<00:05:31.889> bit<00:05:32.159> better<00:05:32.370> if

00:05:32.629 --> 00:05:32.639 
usually looks a little bit better if

00:05:32.639 --> 00:05:34.969 
usually looks a little bit better if
it's<00:05:32.849> placed<00:05:33.150> in<00:05:33.569> the<00:05:33.930> lower<00:05:34.259> part<00:05:34.740> of<00:05:34.919> the

and<00:06:48.419> then<00:06:48.659> you<00:06:48.780> just<00:06:48.990> give<00:06:49.229> it<00:06:49.349> a<00:06:49.379> little<00:06:50.039> bit

00:06:50.270 --> 00:06:50.280 
and then you just give it a little bit

00:06:50.280 --> 00:06:53.960 
and then you just give it a little bit
of<00:06:50.430> fill<00:06:50.669> light<00:06:50.909> to<00:06:51.319> balance<00:06:52.550> so<00:06:53.550> that<00:06:53.580> would

00:06:53.960 --> 00:06:53.970 
of fill light to balance so that would

00:06:53.970 --> 00:06:55.879 
of fill light to balance so that would
be<00:06:54.120> one<00:06:54.300> inversion<00:06:54.599> another<00:06:55.259> version<00:06:55.530> could

00:06:55.879 --> 00:06:55.889 
be one inversion another version could

00:06:55.889 --> 00:07:01.490 
be one inversion another version could
be<00:06:56.129> to<00:06:57.060> use<00:06:57.680> two<00:06:58.680> soft<00:06:59.009> lights<00:07:00.319> opposite<00:07:01.319> each

00:07:01.490 --> 00:07:01.500 
be to use two soft lights opposite each

00:07:01.500 --> 00:07:05.180 
be to use two soft lights opposite each
other<00:07:01.710> and<00:07:02.099> take<00:07:02.789> them<00:07:03.229> further<00:07:04.229> out<00:07:04.620> from<00:07:04.650> the

00:07:05.180 --> 00:07:05.190 
other and take them further out from the

00:07:05.190 --> 00:07:08.809 
other and take them further out from the
camera<00:07:05.520> axis<00:07:06.000> so<00:07:06.990> that<00:07:07.259> the<00:07:07.680> front<00:07:08.250> part<00:07:08.580> of

00:07:08.809 --> 00:07:08.819 
camera axis so that the front part of

00:07:08.819 --> 00:07:12.290 
camera axis so that the front part of
the<00:07:08.970> face<00:07:09.680> looks<00:07:10.680> a<00:07:10.830> little<00:07:10.949> bit<00:07:11.220> darker<00:07:11.699> that

00:07:12.290 --> 00:07:12.300 
the face looks a little bit darker that

00:07:12.300 --> 00:07:15.770 
the face looks a little bit darker that
can<00:07:12.539> look<00:07:13.110> very<00:07:13.169> dramatic<00:07:14.180> it<00:07:15.180> can<00:07:15.449> look<00:07:15.720> very

00:07:15.770 --> 00:07:15.780 
can look very dramatic it can look very

00:07:15.780 --> 00:07:18.050 
can look very dramatic it can look very
interesting<00:07:16.650> it<00:07:17.190> can<00:07:17.400> bring<00:07:17.639> out<00:07:17.789> more

00:07:18.050 --> 00:07:18.060 
interesting it can bring out more

00:07:18.060 --> 00:07:20.899 
interesting it can bring out more
character<00:07:18.780> over<00:07:19.020> face<00:07:19.289> and<00:07:19.650> then<00:07:20.550> you<00:07:20.669> just

00:07:20.899 --> 00:07:20.909 
character over face and then you just

00:07:20.909 --> 00:07:23.749 
character over face and then you just
add<00:07:21.060> a<00:07:21.449> little<00:07:21.539> bit<00:07:21.870> of<00:07:22.169> a<00:07:22.740> fill<00:07:23.129> in<00:07:23.430> front

00:07:23.749 --> 00:07:23.759 
add a little bit of a fill in front

00:07:23.759 --> 00:07:27.050 
add a little bit of a fill in front
which<00:07:24.120> could<00:07:24.330> be<00:07:24.479> reflected<00:07:24.750> light<00:07:25.490> to<00:07:26.490> give<00:07:26.729> a

00:07:27.050 --> 00:07:27.060 
which could be reflected light to give a

00:07:27.060 --> 00:07:30.170 
which could be reflected light to give a
little<00:07:27.449> bit<00:07:27.719> of<00:07:27.930> reflection<00:07:28.680> to<00:07:28.919> the<00:07:29.069> eye<00:07:29.190> so

00:07:30.170 --> 00:07:30.180 
little bit of reflection to the eye so

00:07:30.180 --> 00:07:34.309 
little bit of reflection to the eye so
that<00:07:30.210> the<00:07:30.509> eyes<00:07:30.629> don't<00:07:31.259> appear<00:07:31.740> dead<00:07:31.979> and<00:07:33.319> just

00:07:34.309 --> 00:07:34.319 
that the eyes don't appear dead and just

00:07:34.319 --> 00:07:40.520 
that the eyes don't appear dead and just
to<00:07:35.159> balance<00:07:35.430> the<00:07:35.909> contrast<00:07:36.479> a<00:07:36.870> little<00:07:37.710> bit

00:07:40.520 --> 00:07:40.530 

00:07:40.530 --> 00:07:43.140
