00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:10.019
 hello everyone is steven and today 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:11.580
 I present you a tweak that will be 

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:13.710
 soon available on cydia 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:14.969
 it's called convergence and it's going 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:16.080
 add a lot of small 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:17.250
 features on the screen of 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:19.230
 bone locking 7 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:20.789
 there for example in the center you see that 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:22.590
 I have this little button I can slide from 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:24.330
 down from the top and hop like that 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:26.430
 unlock my iphone so the little 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:27.960
 unlock bar has been modified 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:30.150
 so that's the first novelty 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:31.560
 then if we slide from the right towards 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:33.360
 the left you see we reveal the 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:35.100
 shortcut of the camera so that's 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:37.020
 super easy to access like that with 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:39.390
 a little animation and more so it's 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:40.800
 rather nice and the opposite if I say of 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:42.570
 the left to the right that's what 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:43.559
 appears full of small settings for 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:45.149
 system shortcuts 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:46.410
 so I can like that directly to 

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:48.600
 from the lock screen by 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:49.980
 example switch to airplane mode turn off 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:52.500
 or activate the wifi service 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:54.149
 location the bluetooth is also 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:55.559
 adjust the brightness we have a small 

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:57.809
 bar here that can move left 

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:58.710
 to the right or the reverse to edit 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:00.780
 screen lighting 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:02.670
 so that's how it all works and 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:03.840
 then we have the opportunity to stay 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:05.909
 pressed on one of the shortcuts 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:07.740
 system settings for example here the 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:09.240
 wifi and watch up I landed 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:10.530
 directly in the wifi settings 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:12.540
 so we also have shortcuts 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:13.890
 like that so that's when I told you 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:15.600
 that convergence changes anyway 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:16.590
 radically the organization of the screen 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:18.600
 locking I think you 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:20.700
 understand why right the device 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:22.890
 photo left system shortcuts 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:24.150
 but look at the top instead of the center 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:25.830
 notifications I can now 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:28.560
 dragged down to make appear 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:30.240
 some widgets so all the way up 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:31.500
 my calendar just below the stream 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:33.240
 rss and 3rd 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:34.560
 another widgets that does not work 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:36.000
 still quite with the version that 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:37.409
 I have for the moment I remind you that 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.670
 it's still a beta the tweak 

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:40.470
 is not yet available on cydia 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:40.979
 so in any case that's how it is 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:42.810
 works 

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:44.759
 and of course we find some small 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:46.020
 customization options here in the 

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:48.149
 tweak control panel 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:49.710
 we can for example choose a theme on 

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:51.630
 has two for now that are available 

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:53.520
 we can also put more fonts 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:54.990
 fidh including some small settings everything 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:56.729
 simple and then just below 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:58.380
 can change the interface in the 

00:01:56.729 --> 00:02:00.659
 section background there we will be able 

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:01.680
 choose the degree of blur you want 

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:03.420
 for the lock screen 

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:05.070
 we can just and we can 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:06.390
 choose here what will be the widgets 

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:08.429
 which will be displayed on a screen of 

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:09.720
 lock and in what order 

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:10.880
 by pressing the edit button on 

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:12.380
 can organize them 

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:14.300
 we want to add others you see 

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:15.530
 that I also have the weather that is available and 

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:16.910
 then just below you can 

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:18.620
 modify the shortcuts for 

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:20.840
 system settings that we want I have 

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:22.760
 chose this 6 is here choose what we 

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:23.600
 will want for the preview of the cover of 

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:25.670
 the album on the lock screen 

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:27.980
 when we play music so there 

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:29.270
 I checked mini bike games it's a 

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:30.650
 music and I 'm going to show you the 

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:32.330
 difference on my lock screen 

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:34.340
 so I lock the iphone and 

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:35.570
 Now look up here just 

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:36.740
 beneath them one has the title of the 

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:38.150
 music that is being played and 

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:40.130
 if I display the musical controls 

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:41.840
 that's what it looks like we can do 

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:44.060
 full effect lies in pressing the 

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:46.190
 central button and we can also move forward 

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:47.510
 and back down in our musical reading 

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:49.250
 with the buttons on the right and left 

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:50.360
 so we have the same musical controls 

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:51.770
 we used to have it 

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:54.830
 simply the interface that is 

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:57.230
 different with this choice here min if I 

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:58.880
 go to medium it will be different here 

00:02:57.230 --> 00:02:59.660
 what does it look like now the cover 

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:01.490
 is at the center 

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:02.840
 if I double tap the button 

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:04.880
 I display the controls 

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:06.350
 musical that is just above 

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:08.000
 that's what this second choice looks like 

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:10.490
 medium and if now I pass 

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.880
 fullscreen this will be displayed in full 

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:13.340
 screen 

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:15.170
 look what it looks like so that 

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:16.580
 there I find it really nice function 

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:17.750
 the cover of the album that you will have 

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:18.950
 it can really give a style 

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:20.960
 original to your lock screen 

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:21.470
 so you select here what you 

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:23.420
 prefer 

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:24.740
 and we can also activate or not 

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:25.130
 percentage of battery on the screen of 

00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:26.840
 locking 

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:28.700
 so that's it for all the options of 

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:30.590
 customization that convergence offers 

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:32.150
 you and that it's a really tweak 

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:33.500
 complete that personalizes your screen from 

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:35.330
 lock with the shortcut of 

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:37.400
 the camera the shortcut for them 

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:39.410
 little widgets or shortcuts 

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:40.730
 for the system settings really not 

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:42.350
 bad stuff full of info 

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:43.610
 interesting and useful directly on 

00:03:42.350 --> 00:03:45.200
 your lock screen without having 

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:46.640
 need in every time unlock 

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:48.380
 your iphone or ipod touch to 

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:50.000
 have access so while waiting for it 

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:52.010
 come on cydia tell me what you 

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.550
 have thought about it in the comments and to 

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:55.390
 very soon 

00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:55.390
 Hi
