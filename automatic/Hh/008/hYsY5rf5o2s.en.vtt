00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
slow download and wall jump so and this

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:49.969 
slow download and wall jump so and this
is<00:01:48.600> a<00:01:48.630> forge<00:01:49.049> mode<00:01:49.350> so<00:01:49.500> you're<00:01:49.649> going<00:01:49.740> to<00:01:49.799> need

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
is a forge mode so you're going to need

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:54.880 
is a forge mode so you're going to need
forge<00:01:50.310> modloader<00:01:50.820> to<00:01:51.180> do<00:01:51.299> this<00:01:53.360> except<00:01:54.360> it's

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:54.890 
forge modloader to do this except it's

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:58.850 
forge modloader to do this except it's
um<00:01:56.600> installed<00:01:57.600> differently<00:01:58.110> than<00:01:58.290> most<00:01:58.469> mods

00:01:58.850 --> 00:01:58.860 
um installed differently than most mods

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:02.330 
um installed differently than most mods
so<00:01:59.280> let's<00:01:59.909> just<00:02:00.060> get<00:02:00.210> started<00:02:00.360> here<00:02:00.990> well<00:02:01.860> the

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:02.340 
so let's just get started here well the

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:05.389 
so let's just get started here well the
way<00:02:02.490> I<00:02:02.759> found<00:02:03.299> is<00:02:03.630> easier<00:02:04.020> to<00:02:04.079> make<00:02:04.740> it<00:02:04.950> is<00:02:05.130> um

00:02:05.389 --> 00:02:05.399 
way I found is easier to make it is um

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:07.520 
way I found is easier to make it is um
order<00:02:06.329> to<00:02:06.420> place<00:02:06.570> it<00:02:06.719> down<00:02:06.840> so<00:02:07.229> you<00:02:07.320> don't<00:02:07.350> have

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:07.530 
order to place it down so you don't have

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:11.089 
order to place it down so you don't have
to<00:02:07.649> jump<00:02:07.950> is<00:02:08.190> that<00:02:09.119> you<00:02:09.209> have<00:02:09.300> to<00:02:09.390> go<00:02:09.869> one<00:02:10.739> into

00:02:11.089 --> 00:02:11.099 
to jump is that you have to go one into

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:12.040 
to jump is that you have to go one into
the<00:02:11.220> ground

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:12.050 
the ground

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:15.250 
the ground
or<00:02:12.520> it<00:02:13.520> spawns<00:02:13.880> like<00:02:14.090> this<00:02:14.240> one<00:02:14.480> above<00:02:15.050> the

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:15.260 
or it spawns like this one above the

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:20.550 
or it spawns like this one above the

spawn<00:02:21.560> one<00:02:21.800> in<00:02:24.220> that<00:02:25.220> and<00:02:25.490> then<00:02:25.520> all<00:02:25.730> you<00:02:25.850> got

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:25.970 
spawn one in that and then all you got

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:27.880 
spawn one in that and then all you got
to<00:02:26.090> do<00:02:26.210> is<00:02:26.330> right<00:02:26.540> click<00:02:26.570> it<00:02:26.930> and<00:02:27.020> the<00:02:27.530> mansion

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:27.890 
to do is right click it and the mansion

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:31.270

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:31.280 
should appear see like I said earlier

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:35.230 
should appear see like I said earlier
the<00:02:31.970> torches<00:02:32.540> don't<00:02:32.780> place<00:02:33.020> down<00:02:33.940> so<00:02:34.940> it<00:02:35.060> will

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:35.240 
the torches don't place down so it will

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:37.900 
the torches don't place down so it will
be<00:02:35.390> dark<00:02:35.540> in<00:02:35.720> here<00:02:36.310> just<00:02:37.310> place<00:02:37.520> down<00:02:37.730> some

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:37.910 
be dark in here just place down some

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:41.350 
be dark in here just place down some
torches<00:02:38.320> that<00:02:39.320> was<00:02:39.440> weird<00:02:39.910> some<00:02:40.910> torches<00:02:41.240> I

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:41.360 
torches that was weird some torches I

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:49.090 
torches that was weird some torches I
guess<00:02:41.510> we'll<00:02:41.690> place<00:02:41.900> down<00:02:42.110> but<00:02:42.290> not<00:02:42.380> all<00:02:48.100> okay

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:49.100 
guess we'll place down but not all okay

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:51.820 
guess we'll place down but not all okay
do<00:02:49.280> that<00:02:49.520> there<00:02:50.090> so<00:02:51.050> basically<00:02:51.380> we'll<00:02:51.590> start

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:51.830 
do that there so basically we'll start

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:54.280 
do that there so basically we'll start
from<00:02:51.950> up<00:02:52.100> here<00:02:52.280> I<00:02:52.340> guess<00:02:52.550> this<00:02:53.180> is<00:02:53.360> an<00:02:53.900> attic

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:54.290
