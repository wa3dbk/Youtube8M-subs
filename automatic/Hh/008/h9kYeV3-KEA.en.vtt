00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:23.929 
don't even know if it's done yet because
you<00:01:22.439> don't<00:01:22.710> really<00:01:22.830> see<00:01:23.100> very<00:01:23.130> much<00:01:23.460> just<00:01:23.820> a

there as you can see it's kinda like a

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:47.600 
there as you can see it's kinda like a
it<00:01:45.600> gives<00:01:45.750> like<00:01:45.930> an<00:01:46.020> imaginary<00:01:46.619> hallway<00:01:47.250> kind

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:47.610 
it gives like an imaginary hallway kind

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:50.240 
it gives like an imaginary hallway kind
of<00:01:47.700> feel<00:01:47.939> but<00:01:48.240> it's<00:01:48.390> not<00:01:48.930> a<00:01:48.960> hallway<00:01:49.229> I<00:01:49.619> don't

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:51.420 
know if that that doesn't really make

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:53.719 
know if that that doesn't really make
sense<00:01:51.450> but<00:01:51.930> that's<00:01:52.920> what<00:01:53.040> I<00:01:53.130> kind<00:01:53.610> of
