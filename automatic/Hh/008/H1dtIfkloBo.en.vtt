00:01:41.289 --> 00:01:41.299 
of the map again there you go

00:01:41.299 --> 00:01:43.270 
of the map again there you go
for<00:01:41.990> the<00:01:42.049> next<00:01:42.259> glitch<00:01:42.530> again<00:01:42.770> you<00:01:43.070> want<00:01:43.219> to

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:43.280 
for the next glitch again you want to

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:44.709 
for the next glitch again you want to
just<00:01:43.430> come<00:01:43.640> to<00:01:43.789> where<00:01:43.909> I<00:01:43.969> do<00:01:44.030> and<00:01:44.390> I'll<00:01:44.479> show

00:01:44.709 --> 00:01:44.719 
just come to where I do and I'll show

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:46.240 
just come to where I do and I'll show
you<00:01:44.810> that<00:01:45.020> on<00:01:45.140> the<00:01:45.289> map<00:01:45.500> right<00:01:45.680> now<00:01:45.740> and<00:01:46.130> also

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:46.250 
you that on the map right now and also

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:49.090 
you that on the map right now and also
in<00:01:46.420> comparison<00:01:47.420> to<00:01:47.450> where<00:01:47.689> it<00:01:47.990> is<00:01:48.229> like<00:01:48.950> two

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:49.100 
in comparison to where it is like two

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:51.910 
in comparison to where it is like two
other<00:01:49.280> places<00:01:49.549> and<00:01:50.030> so<00:01:51.020> you<00:01:51.320> can<00:01:51.439> use<00:01:51.590> the<00:01:51.770> two

00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:51.920 
other places and so you can use the two

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:54.940 
other places and so you can use the two
like<00:01:52.159> little<00:01:52.399> cable<00:01:52.969> carts<00:01:53.390> to<00:01:53.840> like<00:01:54.439> pinpoint

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:54.950 
like little cable carts to like pinpoint

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:57.789 
like little cable carts to like pinpoint
it<00:01:55.130> it's<00:01:55.310> kind<00:01:55.820> of<00:01:56.000> more<00:01:56.420> to<00:01:56.539> the<00:01:56.630> left<00:01:56.750> one<00:01:57.049> but

00:01:57.789 --> 00:01:57.799 
it it's kind of more to the left one but

00:01:57.799 --> 00:01:59.770 
it it's kind of more to the left one but
if<00:01:57.920> you<00:01:57.950> look<00:01:58.250> from<00:01:58.340> the<00:01:58.430> main<00:01:58.729> city<00:01:59.090> you<00:01:59.630> want

00:01:59.770 --> 00:01:59.780 
if you look from the main city you want

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:01.690 
if you look from the main city you want
to<00:01:59.869> just<00:02:00.020> come<00:02:00.200> up<00:02:00.380> this<00:02:00.710> road<00:02:00.770> and<00:02:01.460> then

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:01.700 
to just come up this road and then

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:04.359 
to just come up this road and then
pretty<00:02:02.450> much<00:02:02.630> just<00:02:03.140> before<00:02:03.530> the<00:02:03.799> left<00:02:03.979> cable

00:02:04.359 --> 00:02:04.369 
pretty much just before the left cable

00:02:04.369 --> 00:02:06.819 
pretty much just before the left cable
car<00:02:04.549> it's<00:02:04.729> down<00:02:05.030> here<00:02:05.450> it's<00:02:06.109> kind<00:02:06.409> of<00:02:06.500> like<00:02:06.619> an

00:02:06.819 --> 00:02:06.829 
car it's down here it's kind of like an

00:02:06.829 --> 00:02:08.680 
car it's down here it's kind of like an
old<00:02:07.009> building<00:02:07.460> like<00:02:07.850> I<00:02:07.969> don't<00:02:08.179> really<00:02:08.600> know

00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:08.690 
old building like I don't really know

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:10.060 
old building like I don't really know
how<00:02:08.780> to<00:02:08.810> describe<00:02:08.929> the<00:02:09.259> building<00:02:09.590> in<00:02:09.679> itself

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:10.070 
how to describe the building in itself

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:12.280 
how to describe the building in itself
but<00:02:10.369> you<00:02:11.330> want<00:02:11.480> to<00:02:11.540> just<00:02:11.690> find<00:02:11.990> your

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:14.000 
coordinates and then come up to the

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.930 
coordinates and then come up to the
ladders<00:02:14.330> where<00:02:14.600> I<00:02:14.630> do<00:02:15.490> it's<00:02:16.490> pretty<00:02:16.760> much<00:02:16.880> just

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:16.940 
ladders where I do it's pretty much just

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:19.300 
ladders where I do it's pretty much just
at<00:02:17.390> the<00:02:17.480> top<00:02:17.720> of<00:02:17.900> the<00:02:18.080> whole<00:02:18.290> site<00:02:18.650> of<00:02:18.890> whatever

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:19.310 
at the top of the whole site of whatever

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:21.580 
at the top of the whole site of whatever
it<00:02:19.580> actually<00:02:19.910> is<00:02:20.000> so<00:02:20.240> there's<00:02:21.020> like<00:02:21.170> a<00:02:21.230> log<00:02:21.470> on

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:21.590 
it actually is so there's like a log on

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:23.080 
it actually is so there's like a log on
site<00:02:21.890> or<00:02:22.070> something

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:23.090 
site or something

rest<00:03:05.930> of<00:03:06.079> the<00:03:06.140> map<00:03:06.290> it's<00:03:06.500> it's<00:03:06.769> not<00:03:07.489> really<00:03:07.760> any

00:03:07.869 --> 00:03:07.879 
rest of the map it's it's not really any

00:03:07.879 --> 00:03:09.280 
rest of the map it's it's not really any
way<00:03:08.060> you<00:03:08.120> would<00:03:08.239> normally<00:03:08.390> go<00:03:08.720> I<00:03:08.750> don't<00:03:08.870> think

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:09.290 
way you would normally go I don't think

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:10.900 
way you would normally go I don't think
I<00:03:09.379> might<00:03:09.500> be<00:03:09.530> involved<00:03:09.860> in<00:03:10.040> the<00:03:10.190> campaign<00:03:10.730> I'm

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:10.910 
I might be involved in the campaign I'm

a<00:03:10.970> -<00:03:11.120> shadow<00:03:11.420> over<00:03:11.720> lets<00:03:12.709> me<00:03:12.860> just<00:03:13.099> die<00:03:13.310> in<00:03:15.250> so

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:16.250 
a - shadow over lets me just die in so

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:19.000 
a - shadow over lets me just die in so
for<00:03:16.610> the<00:03:16.730> next<00:03:17.060> vid<00:03:17.299> like<00:03:17.959> glitch<00:03:18.530> it<00:03:18.829> is

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:19.010 
for the next vid like glitch it is

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:21.960 
for the next vid like glitch it is
probably<00:03:19.310> the<00:03:19.489> easiest<00:03:19.700> glitch<00:03:20.360> and<00:03:20.870> that's

00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:21.970 
probably the easiest glitch and that's

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:24.309 
probably the easiest glitch and that's
that's<00:03:22.970> the<00:03:23.090> only<00:03:23.360> way<00:03:23.480> to<00:03:23.510> describe<00:03:23.840> it<00:03:24.110> to<00:03:24.230> be

00:03:24.309 --> 00:03:24.319 
that's the only way to describe it to be

00:03:24.319 --> 00:03:25.660 
that's the only way to describe it to be
honest<00:03:24.530> it's<00:03:24.739> definitely<00:03:25.220> one<00:03:25.489> of<00:03:25.519> the

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:25.670 
honest it's definitely one of the

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:27.849 
honest it's definitely one of the
easiest<00:03:26.000> glitches<00:03:26.510> to<00:03:26.750> get<00:03:26.870> into<00:03:27.170> so<00:03:27.440> it's

00:03:27.849 --> 00:03:27.859 
easiest glitches to get into so it's

00:03:27.859 --> 00:03:30.550 
easiest glitches to get into so it's
just<00:03:28.730> in<00:03:28.940> the<00:03:29.060> middle<00:03:29.329> of<00:03:29.389> the<00:03:29.569> map<00:03:29.750> pretty

00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:30.560
