00:00:07.189 --> 00:00:10.830
 hello welcome sense how do we do 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:11.880
 I'm happy to find for a 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:13.320
 new recipe 

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:16.650
 today we are going to realize 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:17.640
 together a fresh cheese cake and 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:19.680
 chocolate 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:20.880
 so it's done in two steps but 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:23.039
 you'll see it's very simple to 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:24.510
 realize and it's a real delight 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:26.180
 I'll explain all this 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:29.550
 now it's gone 

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:32.700
 first step we will take the butter 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:34.860
 which is rather softened sent there 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:37.469
 they are they are doing quite easily 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:45.660
 we will take all our items is to 

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:50.820
 to say flour the icing sugar inscribed 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:53.129
 that chocolate the cocoa in hen then 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:54.750
 of black cocoa preferably one in 

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:57.629
 found everywhere 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:01:00.239
 avoid the cocoa that is used for 

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:01.710
 breakfast I do not know enough 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:04.019
 there is not enough chocolate if there is more than 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:07.890
 stups chocolate but you find some 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:10.170
 cacao cocoa powder well finger 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:11.189
 like that in the comminges look for a 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:14.310
 little bit are you going to see you go 

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:16.650
 so find the principle is we go there 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:18.090
 put your hands of course 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:21.150
 unpleasant to some but the pastry 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:22.670
 is often like that and we're going 

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:25.500
 mix until you get a paste 

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:28.560
 grossly homogeneous so everything 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:30.930
 just see we're going to come bad it's 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:32.189
 the whole thing it's okay is some 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:35.100
 thing that fell but it does not matter 

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:36.780
 see we go wrong it's all together 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:40.490
 that until you get a paste 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:43.259
 coarsely homogeneous to you to play 

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:46.229
 once the pallet has arrived 

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:48.960
 to be kneaded this is what it gives 

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:53.189
 something very homogeneous we are going 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:55.380
 now take our mold that we 

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:57.689
 will prepare by putting a paper 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:02:00.149
 greaseproof then to square mold 20 saves 

00:01:57.689 --> 00:02:02.490
 a little near it will be perfect 

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:04.740
 we put greaseproof paper so 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:05.430
 that not only will it be easier 

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:07.829
 to unmold 

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:10.300
 but we will put the first touch of 

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:12.970
 toulon cookies will cook 

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:16.270
 80 degrees for about 15 minutes and 

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:19.120
 after we add a part of 

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:21.130
 cream with fresh cheese and israel 

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:21.910
 the types hence the importance of putting a 

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:24.400
 parchment paper 

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:26.530
 so we will take our paw and we will 

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:28.720
 spread it over the entire mold part of 

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:30.540
 way furrowed everywhere enough 

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:32.680
 uniformly 

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:34.900
 this is what it should give 

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:36.250
 so obviously left just before 

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:38.020
 to put it in the bottom you preheat 

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:40.810
 your oven to 180 to have a false good 

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:42.870
 hot and go for a cooking 

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:45.520
 about 15 minutes 

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:47.350
 the chocolate cake and now 

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:50.020
 kitchen should it be 

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:51.760
 imperatively cold before adding 

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:54.580
 and the second part ie the 

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:57.160
 cream cheese cream so we go 

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:58.570
 now prepare it for cream at 

00:02:57.160 --> 00:03:00.280
 fresh cheese you will see it's very 

00:02:58.570 --> 00:03:04.120
 simply put the cream first 

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:12.210
 mascarpone in the drummer we add the 

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:20.410
 thick liquid cream is here we add 

00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:24.910
 powdered sugar and eggs on 

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:27.780
 mix everything for 3-5 minutes 1 

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:27.780
 average speed 

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:33.569
 Once the first three ingredients 

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:36.230
 are mixing well we add the 

00:03:33.569 --> 00:03:36.230
 melted chocolate 

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:48.740
 and here we go again for two minutes of 

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:48.740
 mixed 

00:03:51.770 --> 00:03:55.520
 now because sailors are 

00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:58.310
 they are ready we will resume our 

00:03:55.520 --> 00:04:00.500
 soon and how to reverse throw 

00:03:58.310 --> 00:04:02.570
 on it then we're going to make sure that the 

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:04.340
 chocolate tends to those arrested at 

00:04:02.570 --> 00:04:12.770
 background to mix a little bit there you 

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:15.080
 see we just come here and it's 

00:04:12.770 --> 00:04:15.790
 left for at least 30 minutes 

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:18.380
 oven 

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:20.209
 this is what it gives once you 

00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:22.190
 so do not worry about the 

00:04:20.209 --> 00:04:23.480
 little part there it's just that 

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:25.520
 like that took a little bit of 

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:28.490
 colors I wanted to put a package of 

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:29.690
 minium and this one stuck a little bit 

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:31.790
 so when you take it off it's a 

00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:34.280
 little bit torn but even if you like that 

00:04:31.790 --> 00:04:36.380
 you happen this is not a clichÃ© of 

00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:39.470
 anyway once all the whole 

00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:43.190
 is cooled and that zohra precut 

00:04:39.470 --> 00:04:45.350
 see some cuts and we'll go 

00:04:43.190 --> 00:04:47.180
 above the icing sugar and still a small 

00:04:45.350 --> 00:04:49.880
 little cocoa so all that will not be seen 

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:50.660
 more so now let's go 

00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:53.980
 these oven outlets 

00:04:50.660 --> 00:04:56.930
 we let cool ten good minutes 

00:04:53.980 --> 00:04:58.850
 even a quarter of an hour we film and 

00:04:56.930 --> 00:05:00.760
 home and offered at least 

00:04:58.850 --> 00:05:03.740
 two hours feel good cold 

00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:06.140
 the best thing is to do it 

00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:08.780
 the day before for the next day once 

00:05:06.140 --> 00:05:10.250
 more like that it will be well cooled 

00:05:08.780 --> 00:05:13.820
 you can cut beautiful slices 

00:05:10.250 --> 00:05:14.840
 it will be super pretty and here is the result 

00:05:13.820 --> 00:05:18.050
 final 

00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:21.800
 so I cut you into little 

00:05:18.050 --> 00:05:24.230
 share about 5 cm by 2 after each 

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:26.600
 do as he sees fit see we see 

00:05:24.230 --> 00:05:28.940
 well chocolate chocolate paste in 

00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:33.260
 under and fresh cheese dough 

00:05:28.940 --> 00:05:35.300
 on it's really a great cake and 

00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:38.210
 I put a little bit on ice and some 

00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:39.830
 cocoa skin on the top so that's it 

00:05:38.210 --> 00:05:41.969
 did it on the other hand at the last moment 

00:05:39.830 --> 00:05:44.729
 per ton 

00:05:41.969 --> 00:05:46.860
 with cream its tendency to melt a 

00:05:44.729 --> 00:05:49.189
 little bit here's see you soon on how 

00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:49.189
 does one
