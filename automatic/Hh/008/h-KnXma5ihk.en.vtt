little feature you have the clock still
on<00:01:28.410> here<00:01:28.709> at<00:01:28.800> the<00:01:28.830> bottom<00:01:29.039> so<00:01:29.250> you<00:01:29.280> can<00:01:29.459> keep<00:01:29.550> it

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:29.729 
on here at the bottom so you can keep it

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:31.880 
on here at the bottom so you can keep it
on<00:01:29.849> what<00:01:30.030> the<00:01:30.149> time<00:01:30.360> is<00:01:30.390> and<00:01:31.110> what<00:01:31.470> we'll<00:01:31.619> do<00:01:31.739> is

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890 
on what the time is and what we'll do is

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:33.469 
on what the time is and what we'll do is
we'll<00:01:31.979> come<00:01:32.190> into<00:01:32.489> here<00:01:32.700> we'll<00:01:32.849> just<00:01:33.060> stop<00:01:33.300> the

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:33.479 
we'll come into here we'll just stop the

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:35.029 
we'll come into here we'll just stop the
the<00:01:33.929> stopwatch<00:01:34.319> from<00:01:34.500> going<00:01:34.800> because<00:01:34.920> we

00:01:35.029 --> 00:01:35.039 
the stopwatch from going because we

00:01:35.039 --> 00:01:36.740 
the stopwatch from going because we
don't<00:01:35.250> need<00:01:35.369> that<00:01:35.550> at<00:01:35.670> the<00:01:35.729> moment<00:01:35.819> and<00:01:36.539> then

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750 
don't need that at the moment and then

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:38.059 
don't need that at the moment and then
we'll<00:01:36.899> just<00:01:37.020> jump<00:01:37.229> into<00:01:37.410> the<00:01:37.590> settings<00:01:37.950> of

00:01:38.059 --> 00:01:38.069 
we'll just jump into the settings of

00:01:38.069 --> 00:01:40.010 
we'll just jump into the settings of
stopper<00:01:38.340> here<00:01:38.580> so<00:01:38.700> you<00:01:38.789> can<00:01:38.910> see<00:01:38.940> you<00:01:39.599> can<00:01:39.630> set

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:40.020 
stopper here so you can see you can set

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:41.960 
stopper here so you can see you can set
it<00:01:40.050> to<00:01:40.170> replace<00:01:40.590> the<00:01:40.739> lock<00:01:40.890> screen<00:01:41.009> clock<00:01:41.429> if

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:41.970 
it to replace the lock screen clock if

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:43.969 
it to replace the lock screen clock if
you<00:01:42.090> have<00:01:42.239> that<00:01:42.360> disabled<00:01:42.989> but<00:01:43.410> actually<00:01:43.739> just

I'm afraid and but what we do is when we

00:02:18.959 --> 00:02:20.660 
I'm afraid and but what we do is when we
bring<00:02:19.349> up<00:02:19.500> the<00:02:19.590> little<00:02:19.709> popup<00:02:20.040> menu<00:02:20.310> here<00:02:20.579> you

00:02:22.399 --> 00:02:22.409 
can see and although it disappears

00:02:22.409 --> 00:02:23.630

pretty<00:02:22.650> quickly<00:02:22.859> you

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:23.640 
pretty quickly you

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:25.100 
pretty quickly you
the<00:02:23.790> little<00:02:24.030> album<00:02:24.330> art<00:02:24.510> in<00:02:24.630> the<00:02:24.690> name<00:02:24.870> of<00:02:24.900> the

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:25.110 
the little album art in the name of the

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:26.960 
the little album art in the name of the
track<00:02:25.319> appeared<00:02:25.770> in<00:02:25.980> the<00:02:26.100> actual<00:02:26.370> volume<00:02:26.730> here

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:26.970 
track appeared in the actual volume here

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:28.850 
track appeared in the actual volume here
and<00:02:27.569> you<00:02:27.780> can<00:02:27.900> actually<00:02:28.050> have<00:02:28.319> some<00:02:28.500> gestures

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:28.860 
and you can actually have some gestures

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:30.920 
and you can actually have some gestures
as<00:02:29.069> well<00:02:29.250> so<00:02:29.520> if<00:02:29.940> I<00:02:30.060> was<00:02:30.209> to<00:02:30.240> tap<00:02:30.540> this<00:02:30.720> that

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:30.930 
as well so if I was to tap this that

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:32.270 
as well so if I was to tap this that
would<00:02:31.050> meet<00:02:31.230> the<00:02:31.260> song<00:02:31.590> it's<00:02:31.770> kind<00:02:31.980> of<00:02:32.010> hard<00:02:32.220> to

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:32.280 
would meet the song it's kind of hard to

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:34.220 
would meet the song it's kind of hard to
show<00:02:32.490> that<00:02:32.610> because<00:02:32.790> it's<00:02:32.940> already<00:02:33.150> muted<00:02:33.630> and

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:34.230 
show that because it's already muted and

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:36.710 
show that because it's already muted and
also<00:02:34.650> if<00:02:34.920> I<00:02:35.040> slide<00:02:35.340> up<00:02:35.640> it<00:02:35.970> will<00:02:36.180> actually<00:02:36.300> stop

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:36.720 
also if I slide up it will actually stop

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:40.190 
also if I slide up it will actually stop
the<00:02:36.930> track<00:02:37.650> from<00:02:37.830> playing<00:02:38.100> and<00:02:38.700> if<00:02:39.030> we<00:02:39.209> go<00:02:39.959> up

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:40.200 
the track from playing and if we go up

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:41.690 
the track from playing and if we go up
again<00:02:40.530> it<00:02:40.650> will<00:02:40.709> start<00:02:41.010> it<00:02:41.160> again<00:02:41.250> so<00:02:41.490> you<00:02:41.580> can

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:41.700 
again it will start it again so you can

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:43.490 
again it will start it again so you can
see<00:02:41.850> it<00:02:41.910> starts<00:02:42.180> playing<00:02:42.450> again<00:02:42.570> and<00:02:43.260> what

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:43.500 
see it starts playing again and what

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:45.290 
see it starts playing again and what
would<00:02:43.620> do<00:02:43.800> is<00:02:44.070> we'll<00:02:44.520> just<00:02:44.670> stop<00:02:44.880> this<00:02:45.030> track

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:45.300 
would do is we'll just stop this track

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:47.449 
would do is we'll just stop this track
just<00:02:45.600> for<00:02:45.720> a<00:02:45.780> sec<00:02:45.990> and<00:02:46.140> jump<00:02:47.100> into<00:02:47.250> the

00:02:47.449 --> 00:02:47.459 
just for a sec and jump into the

00:02:47.459 --> 00:02:49.490 
just for a sec and jump into the
settings<00:02:47.850> of<00:02:48.090> music<00:02:48.630> card<00:02:48.840> and<00:02:49.140> if<00:02:49.260> we<00:02:49.290> just

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:49.500 
settings of music card and if we just

in to wake info here and this is a quick

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:49.580 
in to wake info here and this is a quick
look<00:03:48.299> at<00:03:48.480> what<00:03:48.810> you<00:03:49.049> can<00:03:49.079> do<00:03:49.350> you<00:03:49.560> can

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:49.590 
look at what you can do you can

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:51.770 
look at what you can do you can
configure<00:03:50.040> these<00:03:50.250> messages<00:03:50.760> by<00:03:51.000> doing<00:03:51.690> a

00:03:51.770 --> 00:03:51.780 
configure these messages by doing a

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:53.300 
configure these messages by doing a
little<00:03:51.959> bit<00:03:52.170> of<00:03:52.200> coding<00:03:52.500> there<00:03:52.829> but<00:03:53.040> what<00:03:53.220> i'll

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:53.310 
little bit of coding there but what i'll

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:55.310 
little bit of coding there but what i'll
do<00:03:53.459> is<00:03:53.579> just<00:03:53.730> quickly<00:03:53.970> not<00:03:54.209> this<00:03:54.390> before<00:03:54.810> the

00:03:55.310 --> 00:03:55.320 
do is just quickly not this before the

00:03:55.320 --> 00:03:57.110 
do is just quickly not this before the
actual<00:03:55.769> where<00:03:56.010> alarm<00:03:56.370> goes<00:03:56.579> off<00:03:56.760> and<00:03:57.000> we'll

00:03:57.110 --> 00:03:57.120 
actual where alarm goes off and we'll

00:03:57.120 --> 00:03:58.819 
actual where alarm goes off and we'll
just<00:03:57.269> kind<00:03:57.360> of<00:03:57.600> way<00:03:57.989> around<00:03:58.290> here<00:03:58.470> so<00:03:58.590> you<00:03:58.680> can

00:03:58.819 --> 00:03:58.829 
just kind of way around here so you can

00:03:58.829 --> 00:04:00.650 
just kind of way around here so you can
see<00:03:58.860> i'll<00:03:59.310> show<00:03:59.640> you<00:03:59.730> get<00:03:59.940> that<00:04:00.239> again<00:04:00.480> in<00:04:00.600> a

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:00.660 
see i'll show you get that again in a

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:02.690 
see i'll show you get that again in a
minute<00:04:00.780> you<00:04:00.989> can<00:04:01.170> actually<00:04:01.320> change<00:04:01.709> and<00:04:02.070> the

00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:02.700 
minute you can actually change and the

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:04.789 
minute you can actually change and the
little<00:04:02.880> and<00:04:03.209> sort<00:04:03.930> of<00:04:03.959> coding<00:04:04.440> of<00:04:04.560> what

00:04:04.789 --> 00:04:04.799 
little and sort of coding of what

00:04:04.799 --> 00:04:06.800 
little and sort of coding of what
actually<00:04:05.040> displays<00:04:05.610> of<00:04:05.910> when<00:04:06.299> you<00:04:06.420> you<00:04:06.660> know

the language here as well so that was
definitely<00:05:03.930> well<00:05:04.290> worth<00:05:04.410> for<00:05:04.590> download<00:05:04.950> and

00:05:05.090 --> 00:05:05.100 
definitely well worth for download and

definitely well worth for download and
that's<00:05:05.280> called<00:05:05.460> bike<00:05:05.669> info<00:05:06.290> okay<00:05:07.290> last<00:05:07.500> but

00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:07.650 
that's called bike info okay last but

that's called bike info okay last but
certainly<00:05:07.770> no<00:05:08.250> means<00:05:08.430> least<00:05:08.610> guys<00:05:08.880> were

00:05:09.050 --> 00:05:09.060 
certainly no means least guys were
