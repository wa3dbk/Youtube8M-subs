00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:09.580
 in this matter 

00:00:07.089 --> 00:00:11.980
 We have here a small bare screen 

00:00:09.580 --> 00:00:13.990
 brito representing the slave of rent 

00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:17.080

00:00:22.030 --> 00:00:27.880
 who visited Brazil there in that 

00:00:25.030 --> 00:00:29.920
 first quarter of 19th century and odebrecht 

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:33.310
 was concerned with representing the practices 

00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:35.890
 Social Interests and a Theme 

00:00:33.310 --> 00:00:37.510
 was the question of slavery 

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:39.400
 In this picture we have the 

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:41.440
 representation of rental slaves 

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:44.350
 which is one of the modalities of the so-called 

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:46.480
 gain slaves slaves to gain the 

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:48.550
 slaves of gain they were slaves who 

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:49.780
 had greater mobility within the 

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:52.300
 urban areas 

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:54.760
 they worked in exchange for payment and 

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:57.820
 portion of that payment was delivered to the 

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:59.530
 Mr. Portion was drawn to his 

00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:01.989
 own subsistence payment of 

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:04.780
 food fault without good part of the cases 

00:01:01.989 --> 00:01:06.850
 also housing etc 

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:10.810
 because well the slaves gain and is a 

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:12.760
 slave who is present there at the 

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:15.370
 historiography like that slave 

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:18.880
 absentee or that he has a greater 

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:21.040
 freedom despite continuing to be a 

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:22.090
 despite continuing to be a 

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:23.470
 slave 

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:25.120
 we are going to the alternatives to 

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:28.240

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:30.130

 crops for the inhabitants of the 

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:35.590
 city b worked in the homes of 

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:38.680
 their masters accompanied the maidens 

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:40.240
 on the streets letter work was carried out 

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:43.479

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:44.950
 the entrance lords of were autonomous 

00:01:43.479 --> 00:01:46.060
 being hired by other masters 

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:47.320
 to carry out activities 

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:49.360

 after landing in the port because 

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:57.520
 and the one that best fits into the context 

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:59.290
 is the letter c on which the cables are 

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:00.610
