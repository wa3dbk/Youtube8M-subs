through<00:00:41.850> the<00:00:41.879> second<00:00:42.329> half<00:00:42.450> then<00:00:43.050> we<00:00:43.200> started

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:43.500 
through the second half then we started

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:45.619

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
throughout most of the game but then

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:53.389 
throughout most of the game but then

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
3 to 13 that's a bad number and you know

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:19.670 
3 to 13 that's a bad number and you know
at<00:01:18.330> the<00:01:18.630> end<00:01:18.689> of<00:01:18.810> the<00:01:18.900> day<00:01:19.080> I<00:01:19.110> think<00:01:19.350> we'll

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.680 
at the end of the day I think we'll

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:21.260 
at the end of the day I think we'll
learn<00:01:19.830> from<00:01:20.070> this<00:01:20.250> I<00:01:20.520> think<00:01:21.119> these<00:01:21.210> are

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
learn from this I think these are

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:22.940 
learn from this I think these are
growing<00:01:21.659> pains<00:01:21.900> for<00:01:22.049> this<00:01:22.200> young<00:01:22.409> team<00:01:22.680> I

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
growing pains for this young team I

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:24.499 
growing pains for this young team I
think<00:01:23.340> we're<00:01:23.460> fortunate<00:01:23.670> to<00:01:23.909> come<00:01:24.000> out<00:01:24.119> on<00:01:24.299> top

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:24.509 
think we're fortunate to come out on top

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:26.179 
think we're fortunate to come out on top

00:02:11.849 --> 00:02:13.640 
from this game what can they learn from
this<00:02:12.180> one<00:02:12.360> well<00:02:12.599> I<00:02:12.630> think<00:02:12.989> the<00:02:13.230> carelessness

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:13.650 
this one well I think the carelessness

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:15.979 
this one well I think the carelessness
part<00:02:14.069> than<00:02:14.250> what<00:02:14.400> the<00:02:14.640> loss<00:02:15.030> of<00:02:15.269> intensity<00:02:15.810> the

00:02:15.979 --> 00:02:15.989 
part than what the loss of intensity the

00:02:15.989 --> 00:02:18.650 
part than what the loss of intensity the
loss<00:02:16.140> of<00:02:16.349> your<00:02:16.670> concentration<00:02:17.670> points<00:02:18.480> I

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:18.660 
loss of your concentration points I

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:20.330 
loss of your concentration points I
think<00:02:19.380> those<00:02:19.530> are<00:02:19.560> the<00:02:19.709> most<00:02:19.860> important

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:20.340 
think those are the most important

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:21.710 
think those are the most important
things<00:02:20.370> in<00:02:20.670> understanding<00:02:21.239> what<00:02:21.269> a<00:02:21.420> winning

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:21.720 
things in understanding what a winning

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:23.839 
things in understanding what a winning
plane<00:02:21.930> looks<00:02:22.140> like<00:02:22.349> and<00:02:23.190> what<00:02:23.430> carelessness

00:02:23.839 --> 00:02:23.849 
plane looks like and what carelessness

00:02:23.849 --> 00:02:25.759
