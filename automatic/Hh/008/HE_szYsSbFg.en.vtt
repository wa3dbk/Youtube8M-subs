00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:08.260
 viewers to your attention tablet review 

00:00:04.090 --> 00:00:11.080
 lenovo 3320 and before we did 

00:00:08.260 --> 00:00:13.360
 unpacking of this tablet under the auspices 

00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:14.740
 what is there in picking now 

00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:16.000
 let's talk directly about the very 

00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:19.060
 tablet well 

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:21.040
 meet on the screen so we will go 

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:22.930
 on screen the screen here is pretty 

00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:26.740
 good and here is the biggest resolution 

00:00:22.930 --> 00:00:29.490
 but I am grit by them when I am not 

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:35.110
 I see that is when reading some texts 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:38.370
 can show honor you can see 

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:40.899
 what's the base instead of the wall changer 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:42.910
 if of course you can look closely 

00:00:40.899 --> 00:00:44.470
 detect some pixels but 

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:48.670
 again from working distance 

00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:49.329
 about 25-30 centimeters and read 

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:51.489
 or 

00:00:49.329 --> 00:00:55.600
 surfing the internet how would it be pretty 

00:00:51.489 --> 00:00:57.489
 Still comfortable viewing angles show you 

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:59.350
 pretty optimal is here 

00:00:57.489 --> 00:01:03.250
 maybe the brightness detail is lost here 

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:04.989
 we see conversion to version more precisely in 

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:06.100
 In general, as if in the sun display 

00:01:04.989 --> 00:01:09.100
 enough 

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:12.939
 bright and it is a pleasure to use it 

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:16.359
 colors convey very well hereafter 

00:01:12.939 --> 00:01:17.380
 the second thing we can judge is the ultimate 

00:01:16.359 --> 00:01:21.159
 operating system 

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:24.159
 Well, it is very struck by the fact that help from us 

00:01:21.159 --> 00:01:26.679
 out of the box bulls versions android 4 2 2 

00:01:24.159 --> 00:01:29.609
 but then the update peedel and now 

00:01:26.679 --> 00:01:32.349
 here is already android 4 4 2 that is 

00:01:29.609 --> 00:01:32.979
 practically the last one and it is 

00:01:32.349 --> 00:01:36.479
 OK 

00:01:32.979 --> 00:01:39.159
 Further, of course, we are all interested 

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:40.040
 performance so I already passed 

00:01:39.159 --> 00:01:43.570
 test 

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:47.240
 tattoo and here brother scored 

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:49.520
 18,400 almost parrots that are very 

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:53.050
 good good but we can see 

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:55.760
 detailed information here 

00:01:53.050 --> 00:02:01.040
 used as an accelerator mali-400 

00:01:55.760 --> 00:02:07.250
 and a resolution of 1024 by mediatek 600 

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:09.890
 83 82 dual core processor that's what 

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:11.080
 there is a way there is a camera resolution of 2 

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:14.390
 megapixels 

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:20.150
 Well, in principle, there is 1 gigabyte 

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:25.310
 RAM 16 is built 

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:30.650
 32 gigabytes that is basically what 

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:33.230
 please further still characteristic 

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:37.400
 the nature of the differences from and how long there 

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:40.640
 the tablet has a sound that we have very 

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:42.739
 good and volumetric he is due 

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:44.510
 the fact that we have two speakers in the left 

00:02:42.739 --> 00:02:46.519
 corner gif pro can here here 

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:51.440
 programin interestingly dollars ben 

00:02:46.519 --> 00:02:54.410
 called here which is possible with 

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:58.160
 at home to watch our videos 

00:02:54.410 --> 00:03:00.459
 sound now you will hear what it means 

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:00.459
 finished 

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:13.370
 can you pass 

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:15.370
 our camera is the one that comes from these 

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:18.800
 speakers but take my word 

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:21.250
 the snow is impressive and very good yet 

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:24.290
 what might be interested lovers 

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:24.830
 tablets given let's say this is what 

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:28.280
 here 

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:33.400
 the battery is pretty good right now 

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:33.400
 we'll see how much we worked 

00:03:34.210 --> 00:03:40.850
 worked for three days 2:38 that's how they say 

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:42.380
 the rule here is the background of the school used 

00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:45.650
 standby time 

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:47.330
 but in general it is not the first to understand it. 

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:50.900
 charging so we used this 

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:55.520
 course and about three or four days here and 

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:58.670
 could make sure that three houses 

00:03:55.520 --> 00:04:02.090
 don't we have people used a tablet by 

00:03:58.670 --> 00:04:05.600
 one and we test tested and screen 

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:08.750
 here at full brightness boring my file 

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:10.640
 and lived about 6 hours plus or minus somewhere 

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:12.440
 hour depending on what the load will be 

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:14.600
 processors i.e. it is pretty 

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:17.090
 Good result and I think 

00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:21.230
 acceptable benefits are also here 

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:26.110
 we have 3g will be able to swamp our memory 

00:04:21.230 --> 00:04:31.840
 here we see on this device 

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:34.610
 8 gigs 1 free we had about 

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:37.720
 five or six here was just another 

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:39.169
 subsequently downloaded the application of some 

00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:41.810
 farther 

00:04:39.169 --> 00:04:46.449
 here we have some games down below 

00:04:41.810 --> 00:04:46.449
 we will run examples of such a surprise and 

00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:53.029
 look see how good it would be 

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:56.210
 draws traffic running and 

00:04:53.029 --> 00:04:59.120
 how all is well toy goes to 

00:04:56.210 --> 00:05:06.879
 the first time we omit it therefore pretty 

00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:06.879
 did run quickly well let's both 

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:14.979
 on how we see absolutely nothing 

00:05:14.419 --> 00:05:19.120
 lags 

00:05:14.979 --> 00:05:19.120
 absolutely no subsidence 

00:05:24.910 --> 00:05:32.000
 that is, everything goes as it should and what conclusions 

00:05:29.330 --> 00:05:34.730
 can be done on this tablet with 

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:37.790
 considering the cost is about 1700 hryvnia 

00:05:34.730 --> 00:05:39.820
 plus minus 100 150 hryvnia that is, you 

00:05:37.790 --> 00:05:42.980
 you can rummage through some shops 

00:05:39.820 --> 00:05:45.380
 maybe find a tablet for more 

00:05:42.980 --> 00:05:47.510
 democratic value then i think 

00:05:45.380 --> 00:05:49.400
 what does it get deserves good 

00:05:47.510 --> 00:05:50.990
 worthy of attention then there is here 

00:05:49.400 --> 00:05:53.300
 good sound good battery 

00:05:50.990 --> 00:05:56.780
 good performance for difficult 

00:05:53.300 --> 00:05:59.720
 applications and games and plus there is a constant 

00:05:56.780 --> 00:06:01.670
 3g connection it suffices to a 

00:05:59.720 --> 00:06:04.190
 let's say for the first from your tablet 

00:06:01.670 --> 00:06:06.790
 either for undemanding users 

00:06:04.190 --> 00:06:08.930
 therefore, I recommend this tablet and 

00:06:06.790 --> 00:06:12.800
 let's say substitute here 

00:06:08.930 --> 00:06:15.620
 out of 20 points we leave points so 17 

00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:18.470
 ask your questions exactly 

00:06:15.620 --> 00:06:22.390
 in the comments in the comments put 

00:06:18.470 --> 00:06:22.390
 thumbs up and see you soon
