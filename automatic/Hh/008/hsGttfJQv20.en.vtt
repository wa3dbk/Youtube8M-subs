were just think they get a little bit

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:35.600 
were just think they get a little bit
repetitive<00:00:34.020> but<00:00:34.410> this<00:00:34.559> one<00:00:34.770> I<00:00:34.950> saw<00:00:35.550> the

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:35.610 
repetitive but this one I saw the

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:38.150 
repetitive but this one I saw the
allison<00:00:36.030> i<00:00:36.120> had<00:00:36.809> uploaded<00:00:37.350> it<00:00:37.649> and<00:00:37.860> i

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:38.160 
allison i had uploaded it and i

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:39.470
