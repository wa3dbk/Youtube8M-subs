00:00:32.569 --> 00:00:32.579 
trying to do here is I'm trying to mount

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:36.680 
trying to do here is I'm trying to mount
the<00:00:33.320> silk<00:00:34.320> on<00:00:34.559> the<00:00:34.620> back<00:00:35.040> of<00:00:35.489> the<00:00:35.850> glass<00:00:36.000> and

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:36.690 
the silk on the back of the glass and

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:39.709 
the silk on the back of the glass and
this<00:00:37.050> is<00:00:37.260> a<00:00:37.290> document<00:00:37.920> frame<00:00:38.309> so<00:00:39.120> it<00:00:39.540> actually

00:00:39.709 --> 00:00:39.719 
this is a document frame so it actually

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:46.040 
this is a document frame so it actually
has<00:00:42.739> another<00:00:44.030> piece<00:00:45.030> of<00:00:45.059> glass<00:00:45.480> that's

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.050 
has another piece of glass that's

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:50.900 
has another piece of glass that's
supposed<00:00:46.530> to<00:00:46.680> go<00:00:46.920> behind<00:00:47.610> it<00:00:48.440> and<00:00:49.440> then<00:00:50.160> it<00:00:50.640> has

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:50.910 
supposed to go behind it and then it has

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:53.049 
supposed to go behind it and then it has
this<00:00:51.210> little<00:00:51.270> piece<00:00:51.690> that<00:00:51.930> fits<00:00:52.170> in<00:00:52.379> there<00:00:52.680> and

00:00:53.049 --> 00:00:53.059 
this little piece that fits in there and

00:00:53.059 --> 00:00:55.400 
this little piece that fits in there and
then<00:00:54.059> you<00:00:54.210> can<00:00:54.360> put<00:00:54.510> the<00:00:54.600> little<00:00:54.780> tabs<00:00:55.050> down

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:55.410 
then you can put the little tabs down

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:57.680 
then you can put the little tabs down
and<00:00:55.770> then<00:00:56.550> you've<00:00:56.910> got<00:00:57.149> something<00:00:57.480> in

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
and then you've got something in

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:00.619 
and then you've got something in
Kingston<00:00:58.140> floating<00:00:58.530> in<00:00:58.620> glass<00:00:59.120> I'm<00:01:00.120> not<00:01:00.390> sure

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:00.629 
Kingston floating in glass I'm not sure

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:04.310 
Kingston floating in glass I'm not sure
I'm<00:01:00.780> gonna<00:01:00.960> do<00:01:01.140> that<00:01:01.320> yet<00:01:01.710> so<00:01:03.140> some<00:01:04.140> of<00:01:04.170> my

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
I'm gonna do that yet so some of my

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:07.280 
I'm gonna do that yet so some of my
ideas<00:01:04.530> were<00:01:05.210> putting<00:01:06.210> a<00:01:06.450> piece<00:01:06.960> of<00:01:07.110> white

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
ideas were putting a piece of white

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:11.359 
ideas were putting a piece of white
matte<00:01:07.560> board<00:01:07.890> right<00:01:08.250> behind<00:01:08.790> just<00:01:09.600> the<00:01:10.369> just

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:11.369 
matte board right behind just the just

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:16.429 
matte board right behind just the just
itself<00:01:11.880> or<00:01:13.729> maybe<00:01:14.729> even<00:01:15.240> putting<00:01:15.479> white<00:01:16.170> matte

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439 
itself or maybe even putting white matte

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:19.340 
itself or maybe even putting white matte
board<00:01:16.770> in<00:01:17.040> the<00:01:17.280> whole<00:01:17.460> thing<00:01:17.759> here<00:01:18.200> one<00:01:19.200> of<00:01:19.259> the

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350 
board in the whole thing here one of the

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:21.649 
board in the whole thing here one of the
issues<00:01:19.619> with<00:01:19.799> this<00:01:20.009> frame<00:01:20.460> is<00:01:20.700> the<00:01:21.150> glass<00:01:21.360> is

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:21.659 
issues with this frame is the glass is

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:23.600 
issues with this frame is the glass is
actually<00:01:21.900> mounted<00:01:22.560> in<00:01:22.680> the<00:01:22.830> frame<00:01:23.070> so<00:01:23.280> I<00:01:23.340> can't

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 
actually mounted in the frame so I can't

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:25.550 
actually mounted in the frame so I can't
take<00:01:23.729> it<00:01:23.850> out<00:01:23.939> to<00:01:24.090> work<00:01:24.240> on<00:01:24.360> it<00:01:24.509> but<00:01:24.869> here's<00:01:25.470> the

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
take it out to work on it but here's the

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:28.070 
take it out to work on it but here's the
exciting<00:01:25.770> part<00:01:26.210> so<00:01:27.210> I<00:01:27.240> went<00:01:27.509> ahead<00:01:27.570> and<00:01:27.869> marked

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080 
exciting part so I went ahead and marked

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:30.440 
exciting part so I went ahead and marked
the<00:01:28.409> sides<00:01:28.680> and<00:01:29.130> I<00:01:29.880> don't<00:01:30.060> know<00:01:30.150> if<00:01:30.210> you<00:01:30.299> can

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
the sides and I don't know if you can

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:34.280 
the sides and I don't know if you can
see<00:01:30.630> how<00:01:30.840> clean<00:01:31.320> that<00:01:31.350> is<00:01:32.360> I<00:01:33.360> know<00:01:33.840> this<00:01:34.110> is<00:01:34.259> a

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290 
see how clean that is I know this is a

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:36.469 
see how clean that is I know this is a
crappy<00:01:34.799> camera<00:01:35.220> for<00:01:35.670> these<00:01:36.000> types<00:01:36.240> of<00:01:36.329> things

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479 
crappy camera for these types of things

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:38.899 
crappy camera for these types of things
because<00:01:36.689> it<00:01:36.900> goes<00:01:37.110> in<00:01:37.290> now<00:01:37.439> to<00:01:37.500> focus<00:01:37.740> so<00:01:38.700> I'll

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:38.909 
because it goes in now to focus so I'll

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:41.179 
because it goes in now to focus so I'll
try<00:01:39.119> to<00:01:39.180> move<00:01:39.360> it<00:01:39.479> a<00:01:39.540> little<00:01:39.570> slower<00:01:39.960> so<00:01:40.350> I

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:41.189 
try to move it a little slower so I

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:42.440 
try to move it a little slower so I
don't<00:01:41.490> know<00:01:41.549> if<00:01:41.610> you<00:01:41.700> can<00:01:41.820> see<00:01:41.939> how<00:01:42.030> clean<00:01:42.299> this

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:42.450 
don't know if you can see how clean this

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:44.260 
don't know if you can see how clean this
is<00:01:42.630> but<00:01:42.810> I<00:01:42.840> went<00:01:43.110> ahead<00:01:43.229> and<00:01:43.560> trimmed<00:01:43.860> this

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:44.270 
is but I went ahead and trimmed this

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:48.440 
is but I went ahead and trimmed this
with<00:01:45.270> a<00:01:45.630> razor<00:01:46.110> blade<00:01:46.229> and<00:01:46.649> it<00:01:47.610> trimmed<00:01:48.119> up

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
with a razor blade and it trimmed up

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:50.420 
with a razor blade and it trimmed up
perfectly<00:01:49.020> and<00:01:49.409> I'm<00:01:49.740> going<00:01:49.920> to<00:01:49.979> show<00:01:50.130> you<00:01:50.159> on

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:52.890 
the other side here cos I was so excited

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:55.789 
the other side here cos I was so excited
how<00:01:53.460> this<00:01:53.700> worked<00:01:54.030> my<00:01:54.899> rulers<00:01:55.320> a<00:01:55.350> little<00:01:55.680> bit

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:55.799 
how this worked my rulers a little bit

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:59.569 
how this worked my rulers a little bit
too<00:01:55.950> big<00:01:56.219> to<00:01:56.340> fit<00:01:56.490> in<00:01:56.640> there<00:01:56.880> so<00:01:57.590> using<00:01:58.590> my

00:01:59.569 --> 00:01:59.579 
too big to fit in there so using my

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:05.039 
too big to fit in there so using my
palate<00:02:00.420> and

00:02:05.039 --> 00:02:05.049 

00:02:05.049 --> 00:02:07.840 

measured<00:02:06.049> it<00:02:06.229> to<00:02:06.619> see<00:02:06.860> exactly<00:02:07.280> how<00:02:07.549> much<00:02:07.700> I

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:07.850 
measured it to see exactly how much I

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:10.419 
measured it to see exactly how much I
need<00:02:08.000> to<00:02:08.030> trim<00:02:08.330> off<00:02:08.539> on<00:02:08.990> both<00:02:09.410> ends<00:02:09.770> to<00:02:10.100> make<00:02:10.280> it

00:02:10.419 --> 00:02:10.429 
need to trim off on both ends to make it

00:02:10.429 --> 00:02:14.350 
need to trim off on both ends to make it
even<00:02:11.650> so<00:02:12.650> I've<00:02:12.770> got<00:02:12.980> a<00:02:13.010> brand<00:02:13.700> new<00:02:13.760> razor<00:02:14.030> blade

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:14.360 
even so I've got a brand new razor blade

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:32.290 
even so I've got a brand new razor blade
here<00:02:29.440> corner<00:02:30.440> here<00:02:30.770> at<00:02:31.370> the<00:02:31.520> razor<00:02:31.760> blade<00:02:32.090> you

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:32.300 
here corner here at the razor blade you

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:33.760 
here corner here at the razor blade you
probably<00:02:32.630> can't<00:02:32.870> see<00:02:32.959> what<00:02:33.260> I'm<00:02:33.350> doing

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:33.770 
probably can't see what I'm doing

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:36.370 
probably can't see what I'm doing
because<00:02:34.150> it's<00:02:35.150> not<00:02:35.420> the<00:02:35.569> right<00:02:35.600> angle<00:02:36.020> maybe

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:36.380 
because it's not the right angle maybe

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:41.170 
because it's not the right angle maybe
that's<00:02:36.709> a<00:02:36.860> better<00:02:36.980> angle<00:02:39.430> just<00:02:40.430> lift<00:02:40.850> it<00:02:41.030> up

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:41.180 
that's a better angle just lift it up

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:44.199 
that's a better angle just lift it up
now<00:02:41.450> when<00:02:42.200> I<00:02:42.230> put<00:02:42.830> the<00:02:43.069> varnish<00:02:43.610> on<00:02:43.790> I<00:02:44.000> made

00:02:44.199 --> 00:02:44.209 
now when I put the varnish on I made

00:02:44.209 --> 00:02:46.870 
now when I put the varnish on I made
sure<00:02:44.480> that<00:02:44.510> I<00:02:44.780> went<00:02:45.170> over<00:02:45.560> the<00:02:45.709> edge<00:02:45.739> on<00:02:46.370> every

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:46.880 
sure that I went over the edge on every

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:57.030 
sure that I went over the edge on every
single<00:02:47.269> edge<00:02:47.450> so<00:02:47.810> I<00:02:47.840> could<00:02:48.140> do<00:02:48.319> this<00:02:48.560> and<00:02:49.400> then

00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:57.040 

00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:01.420 

and<00:02:58.540> then<00:02:59.540> I<00:02:59.660> can<00:02:59.930> come<00:03:00.319> back<00:03:00.500> and<00:03:00.799> just<00:03:01.100> clean

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:01.430 
and then I can come back and just clean

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:04.000 
and then I can come back and just clean
up<00:03:01.459> a<00:03:01.880> little<00:03:02.239> bit<00:03:02.390> of<00:03:02.600> varnish<00:03:03.470> that's<00:03:03.739> left

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:04.010 
up a little bit of varnish that's left

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:05.350 
up a little bit of varnish that's left
here<00:03:04.250> if<00:03:04.340> it's<00:03:04.610> far<00:03:04.790> enough<00:03:04.850> away<00:03:05.030> from<00:03:05.209> the

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:05.360 
here if it's far enough away from the

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:20.309 
here if it's far enough away from the
edge<00:03:05.540> of<00:03:05.660> the<00:03:05.720> picture<00:03:06.430> so<00:03:07.430> there's<00:03:07.790> that<00:03:08.120> end

00:03:20.309 --> 00:03:20.319 

00:03:20.319 --> 00:03:21.990 

let's<00:03:20.860> trim<00:03:21.159> a<00:03:21.189> little<00:03:21.280> bit<00:03:21.489> more<00:03:21.670> off<00:03:21.790> the

00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:22.000 
let's trim a little bit more off the

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:23.610 
let's trim a little bit more off the
tenses<00:03:22.390> when<00:03:22.540> I<00:03:22.599> first<00:03:22.870> put<00:03:23.080> on<00:03:23.230> I<00:03:23.290> didn't

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:23.620 
tenses when I first put on I didn't

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:45.470 
tenses when I first put on I didn't
quite<00:03:23.799> start<00:03:24.040> right

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:45.480 

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:55.430 

how<00:03:45.990> sick<00:03:46.349> is<00:03:46.440> that<00:03:48.950> that<00:03:50.930> so

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:55.440 

00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:58.130 

there<00:03:55.980> you<00:03:56.100> go<00:03:56.280> it's<00:03:56.730> trimmed<00:03:57.270> equidistant

00:03:58.130 --> 00:03:58.140 
there you go it's trimmed equidistant

00:03:58.140 --> 00:04:03.350 
there you go it's trimmed equidistant
from<00:03:58.200> all<00:03:58.500> sides<00:03:58.890> and<00:04:00.950> that's<00:04:01.950> what<00:04:02.310> I'm<00:04:02.460> I

know<00:04:42.740> Karen<00:04:43.740> said<00:04:44.010> she<00:04:44.040> was<00:04:44.520> interested<00:04:45.180> in

00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:45.930 
know Karen said she was interested in

00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:56.420 
know Karen said she was interested in
seeing<00:04:52.370> water<00:04:53.370> lily<00:04:53.790> clematis<00:04:54.450> painting<00:04:55.430> you

00:04:56.420 --> 00:04:56.430 
seeing water lily clematis painting you

00:04:56.430 --> 00:05:01.690 
seeing water lily clematis painting you
take<00:04:56.640> a<00:04:56.670> carrot<00:04:57.180> off<00:04:57.300> the<00:04:57.510> truck<00:04:57.750> back<00:04:58.080> here

00:05:01.690 --> 00:05:01.700 

00:05:01.700 --> 00:05:08.630 

turn<00:05:02.700> the<00:05:02.820> camera<00:05:03.240> so<00:05:03.930> you<00:05:03.960> can<00:05:04.110> see<00:05:04.530> it<00:05:07.640> this

00:05:08.630 --> 00:05:08.640 
turn the camera so you can see it this

00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:11.990 
turn the camera so you can see it this
is<00:05:08.850> what<00:05:09.090> it<00:05:09.120> looks<00:05:09.420> like<00:05:09.720> going<00:05:10.820> from<00:05:11.820> the

00:05:11.990 --> 00:05:12.000 
is what it looks like going from the

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:17.780 
is what it looks like going from the
bottom<00:05:13.310> up<00:05:14.310> to<00:05:14.760> the<00:05:14.790> top<00:05:16.070> and<00:05:17.070> so<00:05:17.310> my<00:05:17.460> next<00:05:17.490> step

00:05:17.780 --> 00:05:17.790 
bottom up to the top and so my next step

00:05:17.790 --> 00:05:21.830 
bottom up to the top and so my next step
on<00:05:18.180> that<00:05:18.450> is<00:05:18.750> to<00:05:19.790> embellish<00:05:20.790> that<00:05:21.180> with<00:05:21.570> some

00:05:21.830 --> 00:05:21.840 
on that is to embellish that with some

00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:25.220 
on that is to embellish that with some
metallic<00:05:22.169> resist<00:05:22.919> and<00:05:23.570> then<00:05:24.570> maybe<00:05:25.050> I<00:05:25.169> could

00:05:25.220 --> 00:05:25.230 
metallic resist and then maybe I could

00:05:25.230 --> 00:05:27.380 
metallic resist and then maybe I could
figure<00:05:25.530> out<00:05:25.650> a<00:05:25.710> way<00:05:25.890> to<00:05:25.919> get<00:05:26.669> it<00:05:26.790> photographed

00:05:27.380 --> 00:05:27.390 
figure out a way to get it photographed

00:05:27.390 --> 00:05:29.090 
figure out a way to get it photographed
because<00:05:27.900> I'm<00:05:28.230> thinking<00:05:28.380> about<00:05:28.620> making<00:05:28.860> that

00:05:29.090 --> 00:05:29.100 
because I'm thinking about making that

00:05:29.100 --> 00:05:32.570 
because I'm thinking about making that
into<00:05:29.160> your<00:05:29.490> dodge<00:05:30.080> that's<00:05:31.080> a<00:05:31.290> another<00:05:31.800> one

00:05:32.570 --> 00:05:32.580 
into your dodge that's a another one

00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:35.270 
into your dodge that's a another one
that's<00:05:32.820> getting<00:05:33.030> ready<00:05:33.360> for<00:05:33.900> at<00:05:34.080> home<00:05:34.290> from

00:05:35.270 --> 00:05:35.280 
that's getting ready for at home from

00:05:35.280 --> 00:05:38.000 
that's getting ready for at home from
where<00:05:35.880> some<00:05:36.030> metallic<00:05:36.419> resist<00:05:36.870> this<00:05:37.410> one<00:05:37.470> I

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:38.010 
where some metallic resist this one I

00:05:38.010 --> 00:05:41.240 
where some metallic resist this one I
just<00:05:38.490> splattered<00:05:39.120> it<00:05:39.240> all<00:05:39.330> over<00:05:39.660> with<00:05:39.690> a<00:05:40.250> magic

00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:41.250 
just splattered it all over with a magic

00:05:41.250 --> 00:05:47.150 
just splattered it all over with a magic
sizing<00:05:41.750> and<00:05:42.750> then<00:05:43.200> I<00:05:43.530> think<00:05:45.680> pull<00:05:46.680> this<00:05:46.830> down

00:05:47.150 --> 00:05:47.160 
sizing and then I think pull this down

00:05:47.160 --> 00:05:50.620 
sizing and then I think pull this down
so<00:05:47.550> you<00:05:47.640> can<00:05:48.050> take<00:05:49.050> a<00:05:49.080> look<00:05:49.350> at<00:05:49.590> it

00:05:50.620 --> 00:05:50.630 
so you can take a look at it
