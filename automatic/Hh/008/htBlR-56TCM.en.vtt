00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:23.880

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:26.869
 in number by teams and I will go alone 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:26.869
 But I'm going to try 

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:34.160
 basically 0 went to 0 

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:34.160
 but God 

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:40.739
 the truth I demand a lot from myself with 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:44.000
 the franc because I like it but I think 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:44.000
 that I am demanding too much 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:48.140
 I demand that they not kill me almost 

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:54.449
 google stretching dude 

00:00:51.579 --> 00:00:54.449
 it will be possible 

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:59.630
 plus 

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:06.010
 there was one around here it's worth it because I've 

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:06.010
 viewed 

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:14.550
 that's what I demand a lot and not to 

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:16.410
 myself and the good because I think that 

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:18.990
 I am here a program to experience 

00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:23.510

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:43.690
 then I am demanding myself 

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:45.550
 a game of cards when I myself 

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:46.960
 it was to take off but good for that 

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:48.970

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:51.950
 how many attempts took 

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:57.880
 and this time it 's also pretty 

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:57.880
 Rando is leading 

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:06.330
 and we do not like it but it keeps the 

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:06.330
 19 way I put the padlock 

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:11.190
 madrid to that in that short 

00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:14.190
 and they take me out cobra gentlemen let's throw it 

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:15.330
 with tranquility with food and 

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:18.020
 as you will have seen in the title it sounds 

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:22.040
 card all that will try gentlemen 

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:22.040
 solana and but that I will try 

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:28.930
 and it almost nailed him that should have 

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:31.930
 pasted a cup widget and who wants 

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:34.319
 crumble to life gentlemen good equal 

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:34.319
 we go there 

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:40.640
 come on let's go let's go gentlemen i have to 

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:42.650
 encourage him because he also feels 

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:47.170
 encouraged because it is that we have been for a long time 

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:50.170
 trying it said nothing happens 

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:50.170
 Sirs 

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:54.590
 but the tenth in hitting 

00:02:54.980 --> 00:03:00.600
 also find someone 

00:02:57.610 --> 00:03:00.600
 and this I have seen 

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:08.750
 I would try to try to play you 

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:08.750
 place to play if you want 

00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:18.430
 on the road 

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:24.320
 despite seeing how it is because it 's super 

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:26.370
 complicated to play francs in this game 

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:28.620
 I do not even know how this 

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:31.880
 split because these people understand the 

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:34.480
 true and I do not know when 

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:34.480
 something 

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:40.560
 to see if we can take out others and I 

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:42.239
 I think that with this I arrive and I get 

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:44.310
 something more handsome so the truth is 

00:03:42.239 --> 00:03:46.349
 having a lot of quizzes and I think that 

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:48.210
 only to franc or not quite lost 

00:03:46.349 --> 00:03:57.350
 this 

00:03:48.210 --> 00:03:57.350
 but what are you doing there but it's a lot 

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:03.200
 the needle and marc genÃ© 

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:08.130
 voucher voucher 

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:08.130
 to see if I come here like 

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:15.260
 the audio gives you 

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:18.190
 if we think it 's basically because 

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:18.190
 for the money under 

00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:23.300
 I do've given this place much 

00:04:21.410 --> 00:04:25.430
 this frank look I'm satisfied what 

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:28.120
 I feel but it is that 17 short one side 

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:28.120
 I do not want to lose 

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:36.589
 do not miss us that marzipan shot 

00:04:32.969 --> 00:04:36.589

00:04:38.390 --> 00:04:41.390

00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:05.889
 objective 

00:05:07.030 --> 00:05:12.390
 and if you have seen that it points a bit 

00:05:09.370 --> 00:05:12.390
 that's because it's super difficult 

00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:15.090
 everyone 

00:05:20.940 --> 00:05:25.200
