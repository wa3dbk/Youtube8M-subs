whenever the time becomes available like

00:02:59.489 --> 00:03:01.009 
whenever the time becomes available like
I<00:02:59.579> said<00:02:59.760> you<00:02:59.909> do<00:03:00.090> lose<00:03:00.299> the<00:03:00.450> ability<00:03:00.569> to<00:03:00.989> have

those over-the-air updates well
fortunately<00:03:02.849> now<00:03:03.299> there's<00:03:03.599> a<00:03:03.659> site<00:03:03.930> that<00:03:03.959> does

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:04.230 
fortunately now there's a site that does

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:05.780 
fortunately now there's a site that does
exactly<00:03:04.590> that<00:03:04.829> and<00:03:05.129> you<00:03:05.220> can<00:03:05.400> see<00:03:05.519> it<00:03:05.609> in<00:03:05.730> the

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:05.790 
exactly that and you can see it in the

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:07.220 
exactly that and you can see it in the
background<00:03:06.180> here<00:03:06.269> it's<00:03:06.540> called<00:03:06.750> the<00:03:06.870> OTA

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:07.230 
background here it's called the OTA

centralized system where you can have

00:03:14.549 --> 00:03:17.240 
centralized system where you can have

OTA updates stored by the developer your

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:18.710 
OTA updates stored by the developer your
app<00:03:17.400> can<00:03:17.579> check<00:03:17.819> against<00:03:18.150> the<00:03:18.180> database<00:03:18.359> to

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:18.720 
app can check against the database to

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:19.699 
app can check against the database to
see<00:03:18.870> if<00:03:18.900> there<00:03:19.109> are<00:03:19.139> any<00:03:19.230> over-the-air

00:03:19.699 --> 00:03:19.709 
see if there are any over-the-air

00:03:19.709 --> 00:03:21.140 
see if there are any over-the-air
updates<00:03:20.040> available<00:03:20.190> and<00:03:20.700> then<00:03:20.940> you<00:03:21.000> can

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:21.150 
updates available and then you can

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:22.699 
updates available and then you can
download<00:03:21.329> it<00:03:21.630> and<00:03:21.690> flash<00:03:21.930> it<00:03:22.139> if<00:03:22.260> you<00:03:22.349> want<00:03:22.560> to

kind of ridiculously fast so anyway if
you<00:04:09.510> want<00:04:09.660> to<00:04:09.720> see<00:04:09.840> how<00:04:09.959> the<00:04:10.019> app<00:04:10.260> works<00:04:10.290> he's

00:04:10.819 --> 00:04:10.829 
you want to see how the app works he's

00:04:10.829 --> 00:04:12.860 
you want to see how the app works he's
using<00:04:11.129> it<00:04:11.250> on<00:04:11.340> a<00:04:11.370> mytouch<00:04:11.699> 4G<00:04:12.359> I<00:04:12.389> think<00:04:12.720> which

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:12.870 
using it on a mytouch 4G I think which

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:14.900 
using it on a mytouch 4G I think which
is<00:04:12.900> a<00:04:13.019> relatively<00:04:13.470> old<00:04:13.709> device<00:04:14.040> so<00:04:14.400> definitely

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:14.910 
is a relatively old device so definitely

00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:16.759 
is a relatively old device so definitely
worth<00:04:15.120> looking<00:04:15.150> at<00:04:15.540> the<00:04:15.660> video<00:04:15.870> and<00:04:16.169> speaking

00:04:16.759 --> 00:04:16.769 
worth looking at the video and speaking

00:04:16.769 --> 00:04:17.779 
worth looking at the video and speaking
of<00:04:16.859> EPs<00:04:17.010> I<00:04:17.160> thought<00:04:17.310> I'd<00:04:17.400> just<00:04:17.430> go<00:04:17.639> ahead<00:04:17.699> and

00:04:17.779 --> 00:04:17.789 
of EPs I thought I'd just go ahead and

00:04:17.789 --> 00:04:19.250 
of EPs I thought I'd just go ahead and
throw<00:04:17.910> this<00:04:18.000> out<00:04:18.209> here<00:04:18.419> I'm<00:04:18.570> actually<00:04:18.959> using

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:19.260 
throw this out here I'm actually using

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:20.539 
throw this out here I'm actually using
an<00:04:19.470> app<00:04:19.620> developed<00:04:20.039> by<00:04:20.160> one<00:04:20.340> of<00:04:20.430> the

00:04:20.539 --> 00:04:20.549
