00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:19.680 
just basically a round piece of metal

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:22.010 
just basically a round piece of metal
with<00:00:20.250> these<00:00:20.490> they<00:00:21.090> will<00:00:21.150> allow<00:00:21.390> the<00:00:21.450> tire<00:00:21.750> to

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:22.020 
with these they will allow the tire to

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:24.260 
with these they will allow the tire to
spend<00:00:22.260> much<00:00:22.560> easier<00:00:23.039> but<00:00:23.550> I'll<00:00:23.699> explain<00:00:24.060> that

you can easily see that that bearing is

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:53.899 
you can easily see that that bearing is
too<00:01:52.079> big<00:01:52.380> for<00:01:52.829> this<00:01:52.950> axle<00:01:53.369> carrier

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:53.909 
too big for this axle carrier

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:57.319 
too big for this axle carrier
however<00:01:54.750> the<00:01:55.619> axle<00:01:56.039> carrier<00:01:56.460> for<00:01:56.819> the<00:01:56.850> /

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:14.360 
it out I can easily fit the bearing in
there<00:02:12.900> so<00:02:13.530> that's<00:02:13.680> what<00:02:13.799> I'm<00:02:13.980> gonna<00:02:14.130> go<00:02:14.280> ahead

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:14.370 
there so that's what I'm gonna go ahead

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:16.550 
there so that's what I'm gonna go ahead
and<00:02:14.489> do<00:02:14.730> I'm<00:02:15.090> gonna<00:02:15.299> replace<00:02:15.630> this<00:02:16.080> axle

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:16.560 
and do I'm gonna replace this axle

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:19.640 
and do I'm gonna replace this axle
carrier<00:02:16.890> for<00:02:17.340> this<00:02:17.549> one<00:02:17.790> so<00:02:18.269> I<00:02:18.330> can<00:02:18.360> use<00:02:18.810> these

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:19.650 
carrier for this one so I can use these

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:23.990 
carrier for this one so I can use these
bearings<00:02:21.739> as<00:02:22.739> for<00:02:23.099> the<00:02:23.190> difference<00:02:23.610> between<00:02:23.790> a

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:24.000 
bearings as for the difference between a

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.509 
bearings as for the difference between a
bushing<00:02:24.510> and<00:02:24.569> a<00:02:24.690> bearing<00:02:25.049> well<00:02:25.440> for<00:02:25.980> a<00:02:26.010> bushing

00:02:26.509 --> 00:02:26.519 
bushing and a bearing well for a bushing

00:02:26.519 --> 00:02:28.580 
bushing and a bearing well for a bushing
you<00:02:26.670> can<00:02:26.790> see<00:02:27.000> it's<00:02:27.269> just<00:02:27.510> a<00:02:27.690> solid<00:02:28.019> piece<00:02:28.560> of

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:28.590 
you can see it's just a solid piece of

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:31.759 
you can see it's just a solid piece of
metal<00:02:29.299> the<00:02:30.299> pin<00:02:30.569> for<00:02:31.049> the<00:02:31.170> drive<00:02:31.410> shaft

00:02:31.759 --> 00:02:31.769 
metal the pin for the drive shaft

00:02:31.769 --> 00:02:34.789 
metal the pin for the drive shaft
rotates<00:02:32.640> within<00:02:32.970> it<00:02:33.329> you<00:02:33.840> can<00:02:33.989> see<00:02:34.200> that<00:02:34.530> this

00:02:34.789 --> 00:02:34.799 
rotates within it you can see that this

00:02:34.799 --> 00:02:36.770 
rotates within it you can see that this
will<00:02:35.190> cause<00:02:35.400> a<00:02:35.430> lot<00:02:35.670> of<00:02:35.819> friction<00:02:36.120> and<00:02:36.540> a<00:02:36.630> lot

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:36.780 
will cause a lot of friction and a lot

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:39.259 
will cause a lot of friction and a lot
of<00:02:36.900> strain<00:02:37.140> for<00:02:37.319> the<00:02:37.380> motor<00:02:37.709> with<00:02:38.549> a<00:02:38.579> varying

00:02:39.259 --> 00:02:39.269 
of strain for the motor with a varying

00:02:39.269 --> 00:02:42.080 
of strain for the motor with a varying
this<00:02:39.750> inner<00:02:40.110> ring<00:02:40.200> rotates<00:02:41.160> freely<00:02:41.489> due<00:02:41.910> to

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:42.090 
this inner ring rotates freely due to

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:44.059 
this inner ring rotates freely due to
little<00:02:42.329> metallic<00:02:42.630> balls<00:02:43.019> or<00:02:43.380> located<00:02:43.920> between

00:02:44.059 --> 00:02:44.069 
little metallic balls or located between

00:02:44.069 --> 00:02:46.490 
little metallic balls or located between
the<00:02:44.519> inner<00:02:44.670> ring<00:02:44.940> and<00:02:45.090> the<00:02:45.180> outer<00:02:45.239> ring<00:02:45.630> so

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:46.500 
the inner ring and the outer ring so

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:49.069 
the inner ring and the outer ring so
it's<00:02:46.890> much<00:02:47.160> easier<00:02:47.640> for<00:02:48.000> the<00:02:48.420> pin<00:02:48.660> to<00:02:48.900> roll

00:02:49.069 --> 00:02:49.079 
it's much easier for the pin to roll

00:02:49.079 --> 00:02:51.800 
it's much easier for the pin to roll
around<00:02:49.340> and<00:02:50.340> you<00:02:50.489> can<00:02:50.640> see<00:02:50.670> that<00:02:51.150> that<00:02:51.390> pretty

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:51.810 
around and you can see that that pretty

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:54.229 
around and you can see that that pretty
much<00:02:52.049> eliminates<00:02:52.590> all<00:02:52.829> friction<00:02:53.430> that<00:02:53.609> is<00:02:54.090> why

00:02:54.229 --> 00:02:54.239 
much eliminates all friction that is why

00:02:54.239 --> 00:02:55.610 
much eliminates all friction that is why
bearings<00:02:54.690> are<00:02:54.840> so<00:02:55.079> much<00:02:55.260> better<00:02:55.500> than

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:55.620 
bearings are so much better than

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:59.330 
bearings are so much better than
bushings<00:02:56.190> so<00:02:56.780> I'm<00:02:57.780> gonna<00:02:57.900> start<00:02:58.200> off<00:02:58.410> with<00:02:59.190> the

00:02:59.330 --> 00:02:59.340 
bushings so I'm gonna start off with the

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:02.180 
bushings so I'm gonna start off with the
new<00:02:59.519> axle<00:02:59.910> carriers<00:03:00.269> by<00:03:01.230> putting<00:03:01.650> a<00:03:01.769> bearing

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:02.190 
new axle carriers by putting a bearing

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:06.470 
new axle carriers by putting a bearing
in<00:03:02.430> each<00:03:02.970> side<00:03:04.910> and<00:03:05.910> they<00:03:06.030> just<00:03:06.209> slide<00:03:06.450> right

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:06.480 
in each side and they just slide right

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:08.059 
in each side and they just slide right
in<00:03:06.870> you<00:03:07.019> don't<00:03:07.139> have<00:03:07.319> to<00:03:07.440> do<00:03:07.560> anything<00:03:07.799> more

00:03:08.059 --> 00:03:08.069 
in you don't have to do anything more

00:03:08.069 --> 00:03:10.030 
in you don't have to do anything more
than<00:03:08.130> that

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:10.040 
than that

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:12.590 
than that
next<00:03:11.040> I'm<00:03:11.160> going<00:03:11.280> to<00:03:11.400> go<00:03:11.489> ahead<00:03:11.609> and<00:03:12.120> slide<00:03:12.389> the

with the VXL bandit it already has a
bearing<00:04:21.760> so<00:04:21.910> you<00:04:21.970> don't<00:04:22.180> have<00:04:22.300> to<00:04:22.420> worry<00:04:22.660> but

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:23.410 
bearing so you don't have to worry but

00:04:23.410 --> 00:04:24.810 
bearing so you don't have to worry but
this<00:04:23.560> will<00:04:23.740> make<00:04:23.770> it<00:04:24.040> much<00:04:24.160> easier<00:04:24.220> for<00:04:24.730> the

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:24.820 
this will make it much easier for the

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:26.760 
this will make it much easier for the
motor<00:04:25.060> and<00:04:25.360> it<00:04:25.420> won't<00:04:25.570> strain<00:04:25.900> it<00:04:26.050> and<00:04:26.320> it<00:04:26.650> will

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:26.770 
motor and it won't strain it and it will

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:30.240 
motor and it won't strain it and it will
give<00:04:26.950> it<00:04:26.980> a<00:04:27.160> longer<00:04:27.370> lifespan<00:04:28.530> as<00:04:29.530> for<00:04:29.920> speed

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:30.250 
give it a longer lifespan as for speed

00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:32.160 
give it a longer lifespan as for speed
it's<00:04:30.760> not<00:04:30.880> really<00:04:31.300> gonna<00:04:31.480> give<00:04:31.720> it<00:04:31.810> a<00:04:31.870> huge

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:32.170 
it's not really gonna give it a huge

00:04:32.170 --> 00:04:34.560 
it's not really gonna give it a huge
boost<00:04:32.500> but<00:04:33.070> it<00:04:33.430> will<00:04:33.790> make<00:04:34.030> it<00:04:34.180> much<00:04:34.300> easier

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:34.570 
boost but it will make it much easier

00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:38.160 
boost but it will make it much easier
for<00:04:34.780> the<00:04:35.050> motor<00:04:35.260> to<00:04:35.380> work<00:04:35.470> and<00:04:36.960> that<00:04:37.960> was<00:04:38.140> a

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:38.170 
for the motor to work and that was a

00:04:38.170 --> 00:04:42.360 
for the motor to work and that was a
level<00:04:38.470> 5<00:04:38.590> upgrade<00:04:39.310> for<00:04:39.820> Nexus
