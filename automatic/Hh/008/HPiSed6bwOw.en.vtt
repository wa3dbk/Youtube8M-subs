00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:05.190
 very good all of gamer trains and 

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:07.379
 we are here to talk about that the 

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:09.599
 secret weapon that is the new champion of 

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:11.759
 lycos legends the information that we are going to 

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:14.400
 give is already confirmed by riot games is 

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:16.020
 totally authentic and if they can change 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:18.150
 some little thing but in principle it's going to 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:20.250
 be the skills is going to be the look 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:22.080
 ingrid in which we are going to teach and everything 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:23.160
 oficial by rÃ­os games 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:24.600
 the first thing he says about this 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:26.490
 champion is that his skills to 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:28.109
 have a consumption of life that is to say you are going 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:30.510
 to go killing little by little every time 

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:32.969
 use your skills but have a 

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:34.649
 own and unique healing system for 

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:37.110
 this champion and is that by using your 

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:38.430
 skills you are going to leave small pieces 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:40.900
 of your body on the ground that 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:43.030
 catch them then you will heal 

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:44.380
 this is a little more explained seeing 

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:47.110
 the skills so let's go to it 

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:49.630
 we can see that our passive ability 

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:51.280
 it's called cell division and in what 

00:00:49.630 --> 00:00:53.290
 is this is a little bit what is 

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:55.150
 explain in the healing system and it's 

00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:58.180
 that every time it's a skill a 

00:00:55.150 --> 00:01:00.550
 piece of your body will fall to the ground but 

00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:02.560
 when picking up when passing over it and picking it up 

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:04.360
 Well, you will recover a bit by 

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:05.740
 hundred of life for which you have a 

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:07.930
 little life when using a skill but 

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:09.630
 when recovering the piece you recover 

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:12.580
 life is a system of healing 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:14.320
 totally new for this champion and 

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:15.820
 apart from this our passive life 

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:18.580
 it also has another effect that for me is 

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:21.160
 the best and that is that when zack die they 

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:23.350
 divided into four pieces and if one of 

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:26.530
 these survive or after a while 

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:28.090
 then tac automatically revives and then 

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:30.130
 It depends on the pieces that survive 

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:31.390
 that is to say if a piece survives 

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:32.979
 you will receive with less life than if 

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:35.590
 survive in two pieces and so 

00:01:32.979 --> 00:01:38.440
 successively he writes the four scenes 

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:39.880
 a much higher percent of life 

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:41.180
 so it only survives on a piece of your 

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:42.830
 body 

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:44.780
 then our first life of our 

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:46.400
 lives are called crazy hands and consists of 

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:48.650
 start a two- handed punch 

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:49.700
 inflicted damage to online targets 

00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:51.740
 and slows it down 

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:53.360
 we are talking about a champion who has 

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:55.520
 quite pc how are we going to see in the 

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:58.280
 skills our second skill 

00:01:55.520 --> 00:02:00.920
 our w is unstable matter and that is 

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:03.590
 the body of frac exploits a damage surge 

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:05.540
 to the surrounding enemies and the 

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:07.640
 impacted enemies also receive 

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:10.399
 damage according to its maximum life which can 

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:12.650
 be a damage zone very interesting 

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:14.120
 for certain occasions our third 

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:16.310
 skill our truth is called 

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:18.260
 elastic wave and for me it's a great 

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:20.850
 skill since what it does is that for 

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:23.670
 that are placed in a position 

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:26.250
 and after a period of time arrives 

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:27.750
 to its maximum rank and after being the 

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:30.630
 more week you can not select and 

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:32.940
 then it makes a jump and finally 

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:35.580
 falls into an area and stuns all 

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:38.370
 that is to say, it will serve you very very 

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:40.140
 very much to leave or enter 

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:42.330
 different types of battles and to and 

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:44.220
 over to finish at the end so you're going to 

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:46.800
 to be able to study all the enemies 

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:49.260
 close and finally final stability 

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:51.690
 which is rebounding and is that it is topped 

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:54.390
 and pushes the air and slows down the 

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:57.270
 nearby enemies and this can do it 

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:59.520
 up to three times 

00:02:57.270 --> 00:03:01.560
 here we have a little in the first place the 

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:04.170
 image plus the left is the aspect 

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:05.840
 of the champion within the game is somewhat 

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:08.610
 it's a pretty simple design does not have 

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:09.990
 too much complexity but the truth is 

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:14.100
 which is pretty good and looks like 

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:17.400
 quite a abu of dragon ball z nothing more 

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:19.020
 that in green then we can see a little 

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:20.610
 the skills we see where will mark 

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:23.160
 the q is our first unit that is the 

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:25.260
 punch two hands the w is the 

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:27.180
 explosion of our body and the one that 

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:29.400
 divided into three in three animations for 

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:31.560
 so to speak the first one that is knows 

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:33.780
 you place and you see when the maximum range of 

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:36.480
 ability the second one is when it's going 

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:38.670
 jumping and the third one is when 

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:40.580
 you get to the area and there it would be in the 

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:43.500
 moment you miss the enemies 

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:45.900
 we can also see what stability you 

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:48.180
 It serves to jump type walls like the 

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:51.120
 of the dragon and finally our last 

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:53.160
 ability is war we can see it 

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:55.230
 which becomes like a round and starts 

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:57.100
 to exhaust up to three times 

00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:58.990
 in that area 

00:03:57.100 --> 00:04:02.380
 and good this champion because of his 

00:03:58.990 --> 00:04:04.870
 skills and the design you have can 

00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:08.050
 play basically in two positions the 

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:10.270
 judge since it recovers life because it is 

00:04:08.050 --> 00:04:11.980
 a good champion for jungle ar has 

00:04:10.270 --> 00:04:14.170
 a lot of mobility which brings 

00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:16.690
 also a great advantage grenade in 

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:20.590
 judge and also because you have a 

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:22.120
 good damage and it has a lot of range of 

00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:24.610
 attack because it can be quite 

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:25.630
 interesting for only top on the street of 

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:27.700
 above 

00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:29.560
 so I hope we'll see how 

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:30.940
 advance this champion I hope that I have 

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:33.580
 liked the video you know you can 

00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:34.930
 give like to share with who you want and 

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:38.610
 subscribe to the channel if you are not 

00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:38.610
 made a greeting and see you later
