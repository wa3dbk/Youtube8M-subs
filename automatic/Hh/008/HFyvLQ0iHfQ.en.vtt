00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
original appearance so it actually takes

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:04.820 
original appearance so it actually takes
your<00:01:03.000> mesh<00:01:03.719> your<00:01:04.080> character<00:01:04.439> is<00:01:04.530> mesh

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:49.710 
course adds a power called bat travel

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:51.410 
course adds a power called bat travel
but<00:01:50.100> it<00:01:50.310> actually<00:01:50.579> adds<00:01:50.729> another<00:01:50.970> power<00:01:51.240> as

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:51.420 
but it actually adds another power as

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:53.480 
but it actually adds another power as
well<00:01:51.600> called<00:01:52.020> cloud<00:01:52.290> of<00:01:52.409> bats<00:01:52.560> so<00:01:53.250> I'll<00:01:53.369> go

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:53.490 
well called cloud of bats so I'll go

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:55.670 
well called cloud of bats so I'll go
over<00:01:53.610> both<00:01:53.880> of<00:01:54.030> them<00:01:54.149> what<00:01:54.720> bat<00:01:54.930> travel<00:01:55.470> does

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:55.680 
over both of them what bat travel does

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:57.980 
over both of them what bat travel does
is<00:01:55.950> it<00:01:56.100> adds<00:01:56.280> a<00:01:56.520> new<00:01:56.729> way<00:01:57.000> to<00:01:57.060> fast<00:01:57.420> travel<00:01:57.750> in

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:57.990 
is it adds a new way to fast travel in

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:00.590 
is it adds a new way to fast travel in
Skyrim<00:01:58.409> by<00:01:58.920> law<00:01:59.130> we<00:01:59.250> need<00:01:59.399> to<00:01:59.460> transform<00:02:00.420> into

Skyrim by law we need to transform into

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:03.230 
Skyrim by law we need to transform into
a<00:02:00.719> cloud<00:02:00.899> of<00:02:00.930> bats<00:02:01.200> and<00:02:01.619> fast<00:02:02.610> traveling<00:02:03.030> that

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:03.240 
a cloud of bats and fast traveling that

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:05.749 
a cloud of bats and fast traveling that
way<00:02:03.299> now<00:02:04.290> what<00:02:04.500> cloud<00:02:04.770> of<00:02:04.920> bats<00:02:05.070> does<00:02:05.460> is

00:02:05.749 --> 00:02:05.759 
way now what cloud of bats does is

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:08.869 
way now what cloud of bats does is
allows<00:02:06.090> you<00:02:06.119> to<00:02:06.420> fly<00:02:06.840> around<00:02:07.020> in<00:02:07.979> that<00:02:08.220> form<00:02:08.640> so

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:08.879 
allows you to fly around in that form so

00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:10.699 
allows you to fly around in that form so
it's<00:02:09.209> kind<00:02:09.390> of<00:02:09.420> a<00:02:09.509> more<00:02:09.720> manual<00:02:10.170> version<00:02:10.530> of

00:02:10.699 --> 00:02:10.709 
it's kind of a more manual version of

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:13.070 
it's kind of a more manual version of

that travel if you want and basically it

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:13.910 
that travel if you want and basically it
pretty<00:02:13.230> much<00:02:13.379> allows<00:02:13.650> it

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:13.920 
pretty much allows it

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:16.190 
pretty much allows it

understandable because the original

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:17.330 
understandable because the original

consoles in mind as well so they had to
be<00:03:19.680> some<00:03:19.859> optimizations<00:03:20.489> there<00:03:20.790> but<00:03:21.510> yeah<00:03:21.630> for

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:21.780 
be some optimizations there but yeah for

version I personally take the short

00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:30.930 
version I personally take the short
version<00:04:29.320> because<00:04:30.280> when<00:04:30.520> you<00:04:30.580> walk<00:04:30.790> around

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:30.940

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:35.970 
awkwardly floats there in the air
doesn't<00:04:34.600> have<00:04:34.810> any<00:04:34.960> real<00:04:35.110> physics<00:04:35.530> so<00:04:35.950> I

00:04:35.970 --> 00:04:35.980 
doesn't have any real physics so I

00:04:35.980 --> 00:04:38.160 
doesn't have any real physics so I
prefer<00:04:36.370> the<00:04:36.520> short<00:04:36.730> version<00:04:37.090> and<00:04:37.180> now<00:04:37.810> finally

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:38.170
