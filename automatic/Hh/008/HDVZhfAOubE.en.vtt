00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:38.479 

diesel<00:00:35.250> engine<00:00:35.489> came<00:00:35.700> from<00:00:37.100> European<00:00:38.100> company

diesel engine came from European company

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:46.060 
diesel engine came from European company
I<00:00:38.520> believe<00:00:38.820> it<00:00:38.910> was<00:00:38.969> in<00:00:40.190> Italy<00:00:43.160> yeah<00:00:44.160> so<00:00:44.489> 2.8

00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:46.070 
I believe it was in Italy yeah so 2.8

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:52.330 
I believe it was in Italy yeah so 2.8
CRD<00:00:49.010> runs<00:00:50.010> really<00:00:50.219> nice<00:00:50.489> a<00:00:50.789> good<00:00:51.360> on<00:00:51.480> fuel<00:00:51.690> I

00:00:52.330 --> 00:00:52.340 
CRD runs really nice a good on fuel I

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:56.389 
CRD runs really nice a good on fuel I
average<00:00:53.390> highway<00:00:54.390> I<00:00:54.420> would<00:00:54.750> say<00:00:55.070> 3540<00:00:56.070> miles<00:00:56.219> a

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399 
average highway I would say 3540 miles a

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:58.880 
average highway I would say 3540 miles a
gallon<00:00:56.430> and<00:00:57.710> pulling

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
gallon and pulling

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:01.959 
gallon and pulling
I<00:00:58.920> think<00:00:59.399> it's<00:00:59.550> pull<00:01:00.210> weight<00:01:00.449> is<00:01:00.829> between

00:01:01.959 --> 00:01:01.969 
I think it's pull weight is between

00:01:01.969 --> 00:01:07.130 
I think it's pull weight is between
seven<00:01:02.969> and<00:01:03.059> eight<00:01:03.180> thousand<00:01:03.719> pounds<00:01:05.900> in<00:01:06.900> there

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
seven and eight thousand pounds in there

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:10.100 
seven and eight thousand pounds in there
somewhere<00:01:07.380> you<00:01:08.369> can't<00:01:08.909> pull<00:01:09.150> that<00:01:09.180> much<00:01:09.659> like

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
somewhere you can't pull that much like

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:12.260 
somewhere you can't pull that much like
I<00:01:10.409> mean<00:01:10.979> five<00:01:11.189> six<00:01:11.520> thousand<00:01:11.909> pounds<00:01:12.150> is

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
I mean five six thousand pounds is

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:16.190 
I mean five six thousand pounds is
enough<00:01:12.390> it's<00:01:13.170> such<00:01:13.380> a<00:01:13.470> short<00:01:13.710> based<00:01:15.200> wheeler

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
enough it's such a short based wheeler

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:19.010 
enough it's such a short based wheeler
it's<00:01:16.970> definitely<00:01:17.970> like<00:01:18.090> a<00:01:18.299> twenty<00:01:18.900> five

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
it's definitely like a twenty five

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:21.310 
it's definitely like a twenty five
thirty<00:01:19.259> foot<00:01:19.670> trailer<00:01:20.670> on<00:01:20.820> this<00:01:20.970> thing<00:01:21.180> is

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:21.320 
thirty foot trailer on this thing is

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:23.240 
thirty foot trailer on this thing is
ridiculous<00:01:22.320> you<00:01:22.439> wouldn't<00:01:22.650> want<00:01:22.770> to<00:01:22.830> do<00:01:22.950> it<00:01:22.979> it

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
ridiculous you wouldn't want to do it it

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:26.359 
ridiculous you wouldn't want to do it it
just<00:01:23.900> the<00:01:24.900> trailer<00:01:25.290> would<00:01:25.409> control<00:01:26.009> the<00:01:26.159> Jeep

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:26.369 
just the trailer would control the Jeep

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:28.070 
just the trailer would control the Jeep
more<00:01:26.790> than<00:01:27.060> anything<00:01:27.299> because<00:01:27.570> it's<00:01:27.900> such<00:01:28.049> a

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080 
more than anything because it's such a

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:32.270 
more than anything because it's such a
short<00:01:28.439> wheelbase<00:01:29.009> on<00:01:29.520> it<00:01:30.950> but<00:01:31.950> it's<00:01:32.100> been<00:01:32.250> a

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
short wheelbase on it but it's been a

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:33.980 
short wheelbase on it but it's been a
good<00:01:32.460> Jeep<00:01:32.670> I've<00:01:32.880> had<00:01:33.030> it<00:01:33.180> for<00:01:33.329> two<00:01:33.450> years<00:01:33.750> I

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990 
good Jeep I've had it for two years I

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:38.690 
good Jeep I've had it for two years I
think<00:01:34.770> it<00:01:34.860> got<00:01:34.950> about<00:01:35.600> 150,000<00:01:36.600> K<00:01:36.750> or<00:01:37.700> what's

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 
think it got about 150,000 K or what's

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:40.550 
think it got about 150,000 K or what's
that<00:01:38.850> in<00:01:39.000> miles<00:01:39.180> I<00:01:39.509> think<00:01:39.540> eighty<00:01:39.869> or<00:01:40.049> eighty

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560 
that in miles I think eighty or eighty

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:42.980 
that in miles I think eighty or eighty
eight<00:01:41.310> eighty<00:01:41.700> or<00:01:42.240> ninety<00:01:42.270> thousand<00:01:42.840> miles

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990 
eight eighty or ninety thousand miles

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:47.990 
eight eighty or ninety thousand miles
I'm<00:01:43.799> guessing<00:01:44.390> but<00:01:45.619> it's<00:01:46.619> been<00:01:46.950> good<00:01:47.159> no<00:01:47.759> real

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:48.000 
I'm guessing but it's been good no real

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.109 
I'm guessing but it's been good no real
issues<00:01:48.479> I've<00:01:48.659> had<00:01:48.840> minor<00:01:49.290> ones<00:01:49.619> I<00:01:50.189> had<00:01:51.090> a

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:51.119

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:54.649 
issues I've had minor ones I had a
window<00:01:51.509> go<00:01:51.750> on<00:01:51.990> this<00:01:52.799> thing<00:01:53.270> two<00:01:54.270> windows

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:54.659 
window go on this thing two windows

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:56.149 
window go on this thing two windows
actually<00:01:55.020> but<00:01:55.170> I<00:01:55.200> was<00:01:55.350> able<00:01:55.590> to<00:01:55.619> change<00:01:55.890> it<00:01:56.070> off

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:56.159 
actually but I was able to change it off

00:01:56.159 --> 00:01:58.490

myself<00:01:56.340> not<00:01:57.210> the<00:01:57.240> window<00:01:57.630> but<00:01:57.840> the<00:01:57.960> mechanism

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:58.500 
myself not the window but the mechanism

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:01.929 
myself not the window but the mechanism
that<00:01:58.619> makes<00:01:58.890> the<00:01:59.040> window<00:01:59.280> go<00:01:59.430> up<00:01:59.610> and<00:01:59.820> down<00:02:00.259> so

00:02:01.929 --> 00:02:01.939

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530 
check it out just run just like a little

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:19.130 
check it out just run just like a little
tractor<00:02:14.420> basically<00:02:17.600> you<00:02:18.600> got<00:02:18.750> your<00:02:18.900> 4x4

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:19.140 
tractor basically you got your 4x4

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:21.559 
tractor basically you got your 4x4
two-wheel<00:02:20.130> drive<00:02:20.370> for<00:02:20.640> part<00:02:21.120> time<00:02:21.300> for

00:02:21.559 --> 00:02:21.569 
two-wheel drive for part time for

00:02:21.569 --> 00:02:24.020 
two-wheel drive for part time for
off-roading<00:02:22.050> full<00:02:22.980> time<00:02:23.220> is<00:02:23.459> for<00:02:23.700> like

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:24.030 
off-roading full time is for like

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:26.059 
off-roading full time is for like
all-wheel<00:02:24.810> drive<00:02:25.080> on<00:02:25.319> the<00:02:25.410> highway<00:02:25.739> and<00:02:25.890> stuff

all-wheel drive on the highway and stuff

00:02:26.069 --> 00:02:28.550 
all-wheel drive on the highway and stuff
like<00:02:26.190> that<00:02:26.400> part<00:02:27.330> time<00:02:27.480> is<00:02:27.660> differential<00:02:28.410> lock

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:28.560 
like that part time is differential lock

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:30.229 
like that part time is differential lock
if<00:02:28.770> you're<00:02:28.920> on<00:02:29.040> cement<00:02:29.400> so<00:02:29.700> you<00:02:29.790> don't<00:02:30.060> want<00:02:30.180> to

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:32.360 
do that you want to do it part time

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:35.000 
do that you want to do it part time
basically<00:02:33.360> when<00:02:34.080> you're<00:02:34.260> in<00:02:34.380> the<00:02:34.470> boonies<00:02:34.770> or
