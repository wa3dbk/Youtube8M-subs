00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:09.910
 ah 

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:12.940
 sea â€‹â€‹for my life a future us 

00:00:09.910 --> 00:00:14.940
 we have lived from him and we still have 

00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:17.789
 resources within the management area 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:20.710
 natural resources guillermo morals 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:22.900
 correctors I belong to the association 

00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:26.170
 guild of fishermen of greater the 

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:28.870
 relationship with the sea about important 

00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:30.490
 liberbank has been raised field treasure my 

00:00:28.870 --> 00:00:33.280
 grandmother outside who founded the town with 

00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:35.559
 I'm Cristian Cortez Mayor for 

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:37.390
 each tip choros representative of 

00:00:35.559 --> 00:00:38.970
 Harbor captain body in charge of 

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:41.520
 all fishermen 

00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:43.650
 I'm Marcelo de Rojo, president of 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:44.730
 fishermen's union of the cove of 

00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:47.550
 the northern tonality 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:49.170
 our great capital today and 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:51.330
 heritage are the management areas that 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:54.570
 exist in the commune of the fig tree not 

00:00:51.330 --> 00:00:55.800
 But we still have a lot to learn and 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:57.960
 mature in the sense of 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:01.080
 administration of the pact commission 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:04.620
 the idea is to be able to achieve a better cove 

00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:08.030
 and have a restaurant or an agency 

00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:11.400
 boats to walk the tourist depend not 

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:14.010
 there are only many things that here do 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:15.960
 lack to further boost tourism by 

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:17.910
 example we have to have training in 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:20.010
 access to fishermen and having a lot 

00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:21.900
 more infrastructure is the idea that not 

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:24.900
 you're just the fisherman or the museum 

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:26.310
 marisol because we participate and now 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:29.840
 that everyone can do all 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:29.840
 participate is the profit for not 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:36.420
 this area where we are now has been 

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:38.060
 intensively studied by a group of 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:40.710
 scientists and in this work 

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:42.900
 collaborative we have put together 17 years of 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:45.420
 information we also know that this is 

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:47.310
 an area that is extremely intact what 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:52.080
 which gives this place a unique character 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:53.750
 it's important to protect it but this 

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:56.610
 information that we have is going to allow 

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:59.340
 that any enterprise that happens 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:01.770
 Here is very clear what is the variation 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:03.690
 natural of the place this being that 

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:05.280
 could attribute to an impact and who 

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:09.209
 natural our project in general 

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:10.920
 recognizes the value it has of wealth 

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:12.570
 marginalizes the entire coastal edge then 

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:16.380
 all the actions that we are going to undertake 

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:20.130
 they are destined to have the same 

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:21.810
 impact on the fauna of the area what 

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:23.640
 we pretend it is a new way 

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:25.230
 to manage in a way that includes 

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:28.920
 the community that includes the sources 

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:31.530
 productive in the area and that it helps 

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:33.270
 to the general development of the region for 

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:34.530
 me that would be a dream I think so much 

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:36.810
 for me as recorded 

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:38.610
 fellow also us to power 

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:40.590
 access these people that we have both 

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:42.120
 required for so long I think that 

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:44.040
 is everything everything would result in a better 

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:45.959
 quality of life for fishermen to 

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:47.190
 our family groups when alone 

00:02:45.959 --> 00:02:49.319
 with that guarantee of having more 

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:51.620
 tools we would work a little more 

00:02:49.319 --> 00:02:53.819
 relieved would not demand bad handling area 

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:55.690
 removing resources every year 

00:02:53.819 --> 00:02:57.700
 but only 

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:59.560
 we would have other things to do 

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:01.870
 during the year 

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:04.599
 and we continue to preserve it we follow it 

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:08.099
 taking care we will have future for a lot 

00:03:04.599 --> 00:03:08.099
 time and with a lot of seminars 

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:23.040
 ah
