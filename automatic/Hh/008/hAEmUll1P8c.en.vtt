00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:11.610
 hey people crime xi and i will be in 

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:13.530
 Often asked extremely often by you 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:15.630
 Tomorrow we already patch him 1.1 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:17.310
 expected and whether patch 1.7 even 

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:18.480
 possibly the bank robbery is named 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:19.740
 and I have so many times already 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:21.240
 i thought i thought so 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:22.590
 Just make a video about that 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:24.180
 maybe more people are interested 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:26.010
 Let's get to the question first 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:27.420
 tomorrow maybe yes and patch him 1.1 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:28.740
 expected and to be honest 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:30.060
 say people I can do right now 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:31.560
 just can not imagine 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:33.210
 Of course it can be that I am absolutely 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:33.989
 wrong , however, it is still one 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:35.040
 own opinion to it 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:36.809
 I just can not 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:38.760
 imagine there all the rumors that 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:39.960
 Norman already patch 1.7 come easy 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:41.309
 only based on that just the 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:42.570
 rockstar games server down band and that 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:43.980
 is for me personally for a long time no 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:45.570
 reason that a new update comes 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:46.800
 Also, Rockstar has games so far 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:48.149
 always everything on such sheets 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:49.980
 announced and that was in this case 

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:51.120
 of course not so will me 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:52.230
 every case is interesting for you 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:53.879
 opinion is I can right now 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:56.010
 just can not imagine im 

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:57.030
 tomorrow already patch 1.1 it comes and 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:59.070
 now comes to the question 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:00.809
 if patch 1.7 maybe even the 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:01.980
 includes bank robberies and must do so 

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:04.019
 clearly say yes I am even 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:04.979
 pretty much convinced that patch 1.1 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:06.750
 it involves the two raids 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:08.159
 But I have to say that too, I think 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:10.320
 that it will take a while until then 

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:12.869
 actually patch 1.7 convey whiteboards 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:14.610
 I think patch 1.07 comes with the 

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:17.130
 next season will be around the 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:18.390
 18 11 is still a whole bit up 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:19.590
 However, this patch will appear 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:21.090
 I could really do it very well 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:22.740
 imagine if the bank robberies then 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:24.450
 appear with the next generation 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:25.979
 but you have to say that 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:27.270
 if my theory really does 

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:28.680
 confirmed that definitely one 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:29.280
 quite a blow in the face of 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:30.990
 rockstar games 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:32.490
 since we all really have been one since 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:33.630
 year he goes online then just play 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:35.310
 the whole time the wait 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:36.869
 complete community has already been in 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:38.100
 spring the bank robberies promised 

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:39.570
 get and nothing happened and 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:41.009
 if then actually only with the 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:42.180
 next fair love overcomes dream 

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:44.159
 it would definitely be a pretty 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:45.329
 struggled by rockstar games and that was 

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:46.439
 then already my opinion to the 

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:47.700
 Do not ask questions in any case 

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:48.990
 really interested in what he was there for 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:49.649
 one writes me in any case in the 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:50.790
 Comments 

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:52.590
 and now in the end I wanted to say 

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:54.149
 I am also often asked how 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:55.500
 this paint of my cent without 

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:56.430
 is then left to this is and in the 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:57.810
 video description there i have 

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:59.189
 really already require a video of it 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:00.210
 if you do this too 

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:01.890
 get paint then clicks 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:03.450
 simply times the video on how to 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:04.920
 Of course, this video warned you 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:06.370
 if it is then it shows 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:10.080
 a sorry and then up 

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:10.080
 next time today your cry max
