 hello everyone today in my kitchen 

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:07.710
 we will prepare a vegetable dish saute from 

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:11.900
 courgettes 

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:15.690
 for this dish you'll need zucchini 

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:19.170
 tomatoes or tomato paste carrots 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:23.760
 sweet pepper onions some greens and 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:26.220
 garlic and salt to taste and before we 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:29.460
 start cutting vegetables want 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:32.969
 note one important thing to 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:37.020
 your garden and it did not look like a pub 

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:40.350
 spawn vegetables should be cut into slices 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:42.809
 medium sized and maybe even someone 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:45.930
 it seems that they are cut large 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:49.760
 and it is important that in the dishes that you 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:52.910
 will not cook vegetables close and 

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:58.020

 I cut carrots into semi-rings of onions 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:18.450

00:01:11.479 --> 00:01:22.729

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:26.009
 pepper and cut into such stripes 

00:01:22.729 --> 00:01:29.299
 Tomatoes must be scalded with boiling water and 

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:32.329
