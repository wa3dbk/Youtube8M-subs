 to lose weight 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:01.289

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:02.430
 low calorie and will lose weight 

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:05.820

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:10.470

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:20.670
 of calories that this soup will have to 

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:23.939
 soup of the package makes one obviously the 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:26.939
 Soup is home made using natura 

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:29.280
 line potato carrot the beans is very 

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:30.840
 healthier you do not argue only you 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:32.759
 pick up there 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:35.369
 the packaging of the soph package see the 

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:38.549
 amount of nutrient preservatives 

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:40.770
 that whole thing is bad does not hurt 

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:43.110
 sporadically now obviously as 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:46.049
 more processed foods and that the 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:49.340

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:13.980
 Something like that 

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:17.130
 if caloric intake was equal with 

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:18.989
 even if you pay attention to the quantity 

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:25.080
 of calories that you will spend 

00:02:18.989 --> 00:02:28.290
 consuming when it will replace what 

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:29.580
