00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:17.110 
and there's many ways to point this on
and<00:02:15.020> but<00:02:15.740> this<00:02:15.860> is<00:02:16.010> where<00:02:16.220> I<00:02:16.250> bought<00:02:16.640> in<00:02:16.910> me

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:17.120 
and but this is where I bought in me

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:20.730 
and but this is where I bought in me
actual<00:02:17.720> tutorial<00:02:18.530> and<00:02:19.190> I'm<00:02:19.520> going<00:02:19.730> to<00:02:19.790> go<00:02:20.000> and

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:20.740 
actual tutorial and I'm going to go and

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:25.470 
actual tutorial and I'm going to go and
put<00:02:21.740> over<00:02:21.950> my<00:02:22.250> hair<00:02:22.459> I<00:02:22.670> might<00:02:23.480> as<00:02:23.569> well<00:02:23.600> and

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:25.480 
put over my hair I might as well and

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:27.820 
put over my hair I might as well and
basically<00:02:26.480> the<00:02:26.630> shorter<00:02:27.080> lengths<00:02:27.290> and<00:02:27.680> it

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:27.830 
basically the shorter lengths and it

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:29.350 
basically the shorter lengths and it
doesn't<00:02:28.069> matter<00:02:28.220> how<00:02:28.340> long<00:02:28.580> this<00:02:28.790> length<00:02:29.000> is<00:02:29.239> I

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:29.360 
doesn't matter how long this length is I

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:31.540 
doesn't matter how long this length is I
don't<00:02:29.540> think<00:02:29.810> the<00:02:30.530> longest<00:02:30.890> piece<00:02:31.130> on<00:02:31.400> the

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:31.550 
don't think the longest piece on the

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:32.770 
don't think the longest piece on the
other<00:02:31.640> side<00:02:31.910> because<00:02:32.150> this<00:02:32.450> is<00:02:32.600> the<00:02:32.660> one

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:32.780 
other side because this is the one

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:34.090 
other side because this is the one
that's<00:02:32.870> going<00:02:33.080> to<00:02:33.200> wrap<00:02:33.380> around<00:02:33.410> your<00:02:33.860> head

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:34.100 
that's going to wrap around your head

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:40.510 
that's going to wrap around your head
and<00:02:34.930> so<00:02:35.930> what<00:02:36.110> I'm<00:02:36.170> going<00:02:36.319> to<00:02:36.350> do<00:02:36.500> is<00:02:39.280> clip<00:02:40.280> that

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:40.520 
and so what I'm going to do is clip that

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:43.180 
and so what I'm going to do is clip that
underneath<00:02:41.170> and<00:02:42.170> for<00:02:42.560> that<00:02:42.680> I'm<00:02:42.830> just<00:02:42.860> going

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:43.190 
underneath and for that I'm just going

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:45.460 
underneath and for that I'm just going
to<00:02:43.220> use<00:02:43.459> one<00:02:43.489> of<00:02:43.730> those<00:02:43.910> baby<00:02:44.330> clip<00:02:44.690> toys<00:02:44.959> and

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:45.470 
to use one of those baby clip toys and

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:47.620 
to use one of those baby clip toys and
another<00:02:46.100> one<00:02:46.280> of<00:02:46.430> my<00:02:46.550> charge<00:02:46.880> tools<00:02:47.239> you<00:02:47.480> can

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:47.630 
another one of my charge tools you can

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:49.840 
another one of my charge tools you can
use<00:02:47.810> a<00:02:47.840> safety<00:02:48.170> pin<00:02:48.350> and<00:02:49.310> I'm<00:02:49.519> going<00:02:49.670> to<00:02:49.730> put

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:49.850 
use a safety pin and I'm going to put

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:51.550 
use a safety pin and I'm going to put
that<00:02:49.970> underneath<00:02:50.300> and<00:02:50.870> that<00:02:50.930> is<00:02:51.140> just<00:02:51.320> going

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:51.560 
that underneath and that is just going

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:55.920 
that underneath and that is just going
to<00:02:51.680> make<00:02:52.580> sure<00:02:52.850> this<00:02:53.980> this<00:02:54.980> stays<00:02:55.220> on<00:02:55.250> to<00:02:55.519> me

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:55.930 
to make sure this this stays on to me

00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:58.990 
to make sure this this stays on to me
you<00:02:56.930> can<00:02:57.080> see<00:02:57.290> I'm<00:02:57.500> a<00:02:57.769> little<00:02:57.860> bit<00:02:58.430> of<00:02:58.700> brick

00:02:58.990 --> 00:02:59.000 
you can see I'm a little bit of brick

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:03.009 
you can see I'm a little bit of brick
which<00:02:59.989> is<00:03:00.140> quite<00:03:00.380> nice<00:03:01.209> okay<00:03:02.209> now<00:03:02.750> I'm<00:03:02.810> going

00:03:03.009 --> 00:03:03.019 
which is quite nice okay now I'm going

00:03:03.019 --> 00:03:05.380 
which is quite nice okay now I'm going
to<00:03:03.140> take<00:03:03.380> the<00:03:03.650> longest<00:03:04.190> piece<00:03:04.459> and<00:03:05.239> I'm<00:03:05.360> going

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:05.390 
to take the longest piece and I'm going

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:08.170 
to take the longest piece and I'm going
to<00:03:05.720> wrap<00:03:05.959> that<00:03:06.260> around<00:03:06.590> the<00:03:07.550> top<00:03:07.760> of<00:03:07.790> my<00:03:08.000> head

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:08.180 
to wrap that around the top of my head

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:11.580 
to wrap that around the top of my head
and<00:03:08.890> how<00:03:09.890> much<00:03:10.220> you're<00:03:10.430> going<00:03:10.580> to<00:03:10.670> place<00:03:10.940> it

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:11.590 
and how much you're going to place it

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:15.340 
and how much you're going to place it
and<00:03:12.590> fold<00:03:13.069> it<00:03:13.280> a<00:03:13.400> little<00:03:13.550> bit<00:03:13.819> and<00:03:14.600> place<00:03:15.170> it

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:15.350 
and fold it a little bit and place it

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:19.140 
and fold it a little bit and place it
what<00:03:15.620> turns<00:03:16.400> the<00:03:16.549> upper<00:03:17.079> part<00:03:18.079> of<00:03:18.320> my<00:03:18.620> head<00:03:18.860> and

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:19.150 
what turns the upper part of my head and

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:22.960 
what turns the upper part of my head and
and<00:03:20.150> that's<00:03:20.660> why<00:03:20.900> I<00:03:21.250> put<00:03:22.250> my<00:03:22.400> hair<00:03:22.579> up<00:03:22.610> in<00:03:22.850> a<00:03:22.880> bun

00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:22.970 
and that's why I put my hair up in a bun

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:25.509 
and that's why I put my hair up in a bun
earlier<00:03:23.690> on<00:03:23.810> and<00:03:24.500> it<00:03:24.650> just<00:03:24.860> makes<00:03:25.040> it<00:03:25.190> easier

00:03:25.509 --> 00:03:25.519 
earlier on and it just makes it easier

00:03:25.519 --> 00:03:27.699 
earlier on and it just makes it easier
facing<00:03:25.940> this<00:03:26.120> I'm<00:03:26.989> going<00:03:27.110> to<00:03:27.200> use<00:03:27.350> a<00:03:27.380> brooch

00:03:27.699 --> 00:03:27.709 
facing this I'm going to use a brooch

00:03:27.709 --> 00:03:30.940 
facing this I'm going to use a brooch
and<00:03:28.100> you<00:03:28.579> can<00:03:28.760> use<00:03:29.000> a<00:03:29.269> safety<00:03:29.570> pin<00:03:29.840> and<00:03:30.680> put<00:03:30.890> it

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:30.950 
and you can use a safety pin and put it

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:32.500 
and you can use a safety pin and put it
underneath<00:03:31.160> the<00:03:31.310> skull<00:03:31.730> so<00:03:31.970> you<00:03:32.060> can't<00:03:32.299> see

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:32.510 
underneath the skull so you can't see

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:34.870 
underneath the skull so you can't see
