00:00:06.250 --> 00:00:10.430
 artificial intelligence is supplanting 

00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:12.290
 the man in almost all games 

00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:14.209
 from strategy to checkers 

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:16.250
 the computer is unbeatable and 

00:00:14.209 --> 00:00:18.619
 failures he regularly wins against 

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:21.320
 best players of all games alone 

00:00:18.619 --> 00:00:23.390
 the go resists the machine there would be 

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:26.470
 in the gault more possibilities he 

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:28.970
 there are no atoms in the universe 

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:30.259
 the computer becomes a meter 

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:33.339
 of go this is the theme of our debate 

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:33.339
 today in public science 

00:00:34.949 --> 00:00:39.280
 first of all it's a challenge that's been put to 

00:00:37.719 --> 00:00:40.690
 the computer people who 

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:42.219
 are interested in his call of intelligence 

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:43.390
 artificial that claim that one 

00:00:42.219 --> 00:00:46.179
 can put a little bit of intelligence 

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:47.620
 there we hear a machine have raised the 

00:00:46.179 --> 00:00:52.089
 challenge have tried to make programs 

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:53.500
 who plays well in the case of hugo his 

00:00:52.089 --> 00:00:54.909
 algorithms there that works very well for 

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:57.369
 chess that works very well for them 

00:00:54.909 --> 00:00:59.640
 ladies does not walk at all because of 

00:00:57.369 --> 00:01:03.219
 this too many possible shots 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:04.720
 we measure the difficulty of the games of 

00:01:03.219 --> 00:01:05.920
 so a little summary by the number of 

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:07.330
 possible combinations that there can 

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:09.670
 have on the chessboard 

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:11.080
 so I'm going to quote numbers for 

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:12.909
 the assertive english lady these 5 10 

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:15.360
 power 20 the failures it's 10 then 

00:01:12.909 --> 00:01:18.130
 150 and legault it's 10 power 170 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:20.500
 these numbers there is exposed the measure 

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:22.270
 well there the difficulty that there is 

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:23.380
 in the band it's a bit like that 

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:25.119
 problem arising is not it 

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:27.069
 actually it sounds like it's the trap 

00:01:25.119 --> 00:01:29.110
 go somehow share them 

00:01:27.069 --> 00:01:31.659
 is possible to play in a few 

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:35.500
 second part moment we were introduced 

00:01:31.659 --> 00:01:38.590
 the pawns the stones so and the plateau 

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:40.239
 but then it's a whole universe 

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:41.349
 that actually opens that's what 

00:01:40.239 --> 00:01:42.670
 quite remarkable in the shot 

00:01:41.349 --> 00:01:45.640
 is that the rules are extremely 

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:47.019
 simple but the subtlety of the game to 

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:53.979
 from these simple rules of 

00:01:47.019 --> 00:01:56.410
 extraordinary we are working on the 

00:01:53.979 --> 00:01:57.970
 planning in large dimensions she 

00:01:56.410 --> 00:01:59.910
 is particularly about the application at 

00:01:57.970 --> 00:02:01.660
 go to computer game 

00:01:59.910 --> 00:02:03.340
 that's what makes the interest 

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:04.330
 particular of the group as a model for 

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:05.950
 this kind of research 

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:07.869
 legault is very large 

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:09.580
 much more than chess the ladies 

00:02:07.869 --> 00:02:10.629
 so here is a lot of interest on 

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:12.040
 his methods that are first very 

00:02:10.629 --> 00:02:14.560
 different from the classical methods of 

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:16.180
 mini type max and on the other hand so very 

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:21.610
 general very generic able to treat 

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:24.129
 very varied problems on time 

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:26.739
 current the best programs of 

00:02:24.129 --> 00:02:29.409
 taste begins to get closer to the 1st dan 

00:02:26.739 --> 00:02:31.239
 amateur comes to him a little bit a 

00:02:29.409 --> 00:02:33.549
 revolution that has led these two 

00:02:31.239 --> 00:02:35.769
 last three years around the halls 

00:02:33.549 --> 00:02:37.510
 gorilla that we use in the taste we have 

00:02:35.769 --> 00:02:38.740
 so many possibilities to explore 

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:40.480
 we can not do all the exploits 

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:43.150
 but we go into sampled 

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:44.710
 randomly a subset is a 

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:47.380
 little like the polls we go 

00:02:44.710 --> 00:02:49.810
 to be able to get an idea of ​​the opinion 

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:52.510
 without exhaustively interrogating the entire 

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:55.270
 population we will be able by analyzing 

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:58.720
 a small subset of the sequences 

00:02:55.270 --> 00:02:59.740
 possible to infer things on which 

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:02.800
 is going to be the good shot to play 

00:02:59.740 --> 00:03:04.840
 the principle of monte carlo beau is to 

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:06.430
 do a lot of simulations pretty 

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:08.230
 naive to provide from the situations 

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:10.360
 data what are the possible futures 

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:12.400
 so that's a first ingredient of 

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:13.810
 base and a second ingredient that's 

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:15.970
 build a tree of possible futures 

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:17.770
 which is biased which is built in 

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:20.950
 direction of what looks interesting 

00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:22.390
 in view of random simulations bobos and 

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:23.710
 most current programs for 

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:24.970
 that kind of things build a tree 

00:03:23.710 --> 00:03:26.680
 largest possible representations 

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:28.290
 and the best skewed possible towards the 

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:30.160
 interesting areas 

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:32.140
 there was then the big innovation 

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:33.520
 which was the use of permutations 

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:36.490
 which is central especially for 

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:38.680
 little goban go it makes sense 

00:03:36.490 --> 00:03:40.720
 to study when we have a sequence of 

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:41.920
 costs the permutation this sequence of 

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:43.210
 costs look at what would have happened if 

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:44.670
 we had played the blows in one order 

00:03:43.210 --> 00:03:47.410
 different 

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:49.540
 these methods are used very little 

00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:51.130
 human expertise and proves very 

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:53.410
 effective with the mans all the good 

00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:54.990
 programs are are based on this kind 

00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:58.570
 method 

00:03:54.990 --> 00:04:01.400
 so bobo on big goban the gobal 

00:03:58.570 --> 00:04:04.340
 19-19 classic and high level 

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:07.909
 a good amateur let's say by cons on the 

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:12.069
 goban small so the gobal 9.9 mongori 

00:04:07.909 --> 00:04:12.069
 professional level vision 

00:04:16.609 --> 00:04:21.180
 my human players in general knowledge 

00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:24.000
 of go and they know that some costs 

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:26.130
 initial leads to leads to a bad 

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:27.389
 situation what no go do not know so 

00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:28.590
 my handsome without meeting if we let him 

00:04:27.389 --> 00:04:30.930
 a lot of computing time for 

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:32.550
 think and this time he does not have in 

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:35.160
 real time during a game 

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:37.740
 So we will very beginnings it calculated 

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:39.419
 of party we never use a couple 

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:40.830
 provided by the human we will do 

00:04:39.419 --> 00:04:42.840
 calculate a lot of computers on 

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:43.860
 a lot of initial situation in him 

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:45.539
 leaving plenty of time to think 

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:47.009
 quietly who finds that she is the 

00:04:45.539 --> 00:04:49.770
 good answer is the one that goes 

00:04:47.009 --> 00:04:51.300
 match his style the game to him a 

00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:53.070
 number of data that breaks up summer 

00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:54.720
 stored to play in real time 

00:04:53.070 --> 00:04:57.300
 automatically just by going 

00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:58.770
 read the sure hit on the tables on 

00:04:57.300 --> 00:05:00.660
 will very soon blow and suddenly we 

00:04:58.770 --> 00:05:03.449
 is going very very fast so a kind of 

00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:06.570
 compromise between something we 

00:05:03.449 --> 00:05:07.470
 stores as a result of a calculation one is 

00:05:06.570 --> 00:05:10.530
 something that is calculated 

00:05:07.470 --> 00:05:12.210
 immediately very good margins good taste 

00:05:10.530 --> 00:05:14.250
 day by day you are in charge of 

00:05:12.210 --> 00:05:16.139
 the iag to the challenge that is actually 

00:05:14.250 --> 00:05:17.490
 very much in line with our concern 

00:05:16.139 --> 00:05:19.650
 today what is it 

00:05:17.490 --> 00:05:21.900
 quite i had this idea to put 

00:05:19.650 --> 00:05:24.690
 actually stage a human player 

00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:27.780
 facing the best programs we have 

00:05:24.690 --> 00:05:29.910
 referenced it is called developed mogo 

00:05:27.780 --> 00:05:30.380
 by the future inria you make 

00:05:29.910 --> 00:05:32.909
 part 

00:05:30.380 --> 00:05:34.440
 we're doing tests right now on 

00:05:32.909 --> 00:05:36.900
 what is called massive parallelism 

00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:38.159
 and in particular we should have for 

00:05:36.900 --> 00:05:39.630
 eag to the challenge 

00:05:38.159 --> 00:05:42.840
 several hundred processors 

00:05:39.630 --> 00:05:45.180
 simultaneously working a third 

00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:47.430
 big block in morrow progress which 

00:05:45.180 --> 00:05:48.960
 is later 

00:05:47.430 --> 00:05:51.210
 the good performances we had 

00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:53.100
 against professionals has been the 

00:05:51.210 --> 00:05:54.810
 parallelization both on the aspect 

00:05:53.100 --> 00:05:56.760
 multi hearts and multi ne which allows 

00:05:54.810 --> 00:05:58.740
 to have much bigger power 

00:05:56.760 --> 00:06:00.780
 of calculation since the mogho that was 

00:05:58.740 --> 00:06:02.940
 used in 2007 player contracts 

00:06:00.780 --> 00:06:05.250
 professionals and a pc a good pc say 

00:06:02.940 --> 00:06:06.510
 but not at all unusual then 

00:06:05.250 --> 00:06:08.730
 that badly use very large 

00:06:06.510 --> 00:06:12.450
 machines and we change the algorithm for 

00:06:08.730 --> 00:06:14.340
 adapt it to its parallel machines I 

00:06:12.450 --> 00:06:16.890
 think that in 19-19 we really have a lot 

00:06:14.340 --> 00:06:18.600
 a lot of headroom before arriving 

00:06:16.890 --> 00:06:20.430
 to beat the professional humans 

00:06:18.600 --> 00:06:22.320
 know what are the things that him 

00:06:20.430 --> 00:06:25.940
 will I do not know but it's 

00:06:22.320 --> 00:06:25.940
 it's not quite short term
