00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:14.549
 when it comes to feeding our animals 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:17.880
 we must ensure that all your 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:20.609
 needs are compensated without 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:23.660
 references nor boss so that 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:26.279
 get a good physical condition 

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:28.710
 health and vitality 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:31.140
 throughout his life that has been enlightened 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:34.710
 is in commercial movement or 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:37.260
 bought brings more benefits in cooking 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:40.200
 It is time to decide if we choose 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:42.420
 dry food polishing me in 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:44.100
 My opinion polishing does not have me 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:46.829
 some disadvantages 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:49.289
 since it has in its composition about 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:52.230
 of 80% than just water 

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:55.379
 the cans once opened have a time of 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:58.649
 conservation than food 

00:00:55.379 --> 00:01:01.320
 comes the fact that water its cost 

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:04.830
 per gram is much higher than the 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:06.720
 dry foods and finally causes 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:09.720
 more ease and changes 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:13.799
 gastrointestinal euphoria as unique 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:16.320
 plus the fact that more palatable and 

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:16.890
 therefore more appreciated by dogs and 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:18.930
 cats 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:22.170
 in the case of dry foods their content 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:25.439
 in water is reduced by about 14 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:28.560
 percent on average 8 10% are food 

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:30.810
 complete and balanced solution contains all 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:33.030
 necessary ingredients and are more 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:36.479
 easy to store canned the 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:39.689
 better are more economical and even 

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:42.390
 easier to deduct does not dry 

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:45.060
 however, the same productivity as the 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:47.280
 wet food and at home with the dogs 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:48.030
 rather the title can sometimes be a 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:51.360
 problem 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:55.470
 cats are species and tv really 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:57.770
 well as food and in some cases 

00:01:55.470 --> 00:02:00.259
 however there is justification for 

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:02.840
 was the least in order to increase its 

00:02:00.259 --> 00:02:05.409
 water intake so problematic 

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:05.409
 in this species
