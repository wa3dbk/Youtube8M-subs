00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.290
 I think it will help especially if it is 

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:06.240
 just 1 day a week I think it is 

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:08.099
 will make big changes not only for 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:10.559
 environment but also for animals and 

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:12.300
 Of course for our body, I think it is 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:15.360
 not only help but also positive 

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:16.379
 will affect karma greenhouse gases this 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:18.449
 serious problem 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:20.430
 global warming is very serious 

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:22.199
 problem but does anyone even talk about 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:24.420
 how much water does it require from it 

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:26.789
 so much waste and I think the more 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:28.500
 people will know about it the more 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:31.759
 there will be a choice because it is very 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:35.520
 just make it very simple to choose 

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:38.070
 give up meat on day 1 day in 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:40.920
 week and then one day turns into 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:42.870
 two days two days turn into three days and 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:44.480
 as a result it will render very 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:46.289
 significant influence 

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:47.700
 vegetarianism requires only a tenth 

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:49.590
 part of the resources that go to 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:50.940
 meat production is therefore obvious that 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:53.010
 it contributes to the preservation of life 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:53.640
 man on earth has finally started something 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:55.649
 change 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:58.350
 it was definitely missed i part 

00:00:55.649 --> 00:01:01.289
 uncomfortable truth animals suffer people 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:03.510
 suffer we have to do something and 

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:05.309
 fast you can't be no sayed and we 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:07.260
 call yourself a conservationist you 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:09.090
 can get a lot of protein from peanuts i 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:10.770
 grew up in Canada on a diet of meat and 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:12.630
 potatoes and wanted when there was no 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:14.159
 meat lover me so raised and 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:16.439
 changing my habits was pretty 

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:17.460
 difficult so i think people do 

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:19.650
 the best they can 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:22.290
 let's eat less animals and generally them 

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:23.759
 there is no difference it will be obvious you will not 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:26.100
 you need to become one hundred percent 

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:27.990
 Victorians but do not need to use 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:30.840
 meat in such huge quantities as 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:33.210
 Now the USA Yes I do not think that everything is on 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:37.140
 the planet will give up meat it's not 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:41.070
 realistic but i think we can get across 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:45.869
 to people that meat does not benefit and 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:48.149
 health especially in the quantities in 

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:50.280
 which it is used now by people not 

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:52.229
 think when people eat meat 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:54.450
 ponder how this meat is produced 

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:55.790
 people don't think about practicing on 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:58.210
 livestock industry 

00:01:55.790 --> 00:02:00.860
 because this is something far doesn't know 

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:02.360
 but suppose you drive a car 

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:04.280
 An SUV is passing by 

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:06.680
 being a hybrid as possible your 

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:08.570
 car you must criticize him 

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:10.820
 it's easy to criticize but first we 

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:13.100
 must start yourself and choose carefully 

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:15.620
 what we have like that is when it 

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:17.720
 there is and where to take it to each of us 

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:20.480
 need to do research and find out 

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:22.310
 similar things to be smarter therefore 

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:24.410
 when we talk about SUVs and 

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:27.459
 greenhouse gases then we need to understand 

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:30.459
 where do most of these gases come from 

00:02:27.459 --> 00:02:30.459
 right
