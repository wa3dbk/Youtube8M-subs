00:00:01.399 --> 00:00:12.420
 hello this video will be dedicated 

00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:16.470
 I would like to share the repair of the receiver 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:21.439
 my personal experience my personal receiver and 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:24.539
 how to say it was a skew phase 

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:30.359
 overstrain but apparently because judging 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:34.940
 on the breakdowns that arose to wear 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:38.579
 was overstated the tension was completed 

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:42.480
 here and in one fine moment literally 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:45.920
 a couple of days ago created such a powerful 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:52.430
 some sort of shoot capacitor and 

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:54.510
 This receiver here I will show you to her garden 

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:57.750
 a lot of it 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:01:03.030
 they are the same Arthur 41 20 he and there 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:08.369
 a bunch of their species is all clones well and here's how 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:11.119
 would the power supply here it is here here well 

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:15.210
 and motherboard 

00:01:11.119 --> 00:01:17.220
 all the standards that I had mean 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:20.189
 he was out of order 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:24.090
 went of course the smoke of the shot something but I 

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:26.500
 disassembled in general could principle 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:30.520
 buy completely block but 

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:35.050
 the goal was set to repair too 

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:39.700
 it was painfully interesting what 

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:40.600
 interesting what else is here 

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:44.820
 fuse 

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:48.040
 here if you can see he remained intact 

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:53.770
 so there was such a breakdown 

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:57.070
 with two diodes on short here I replaced 

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:59.500
 all four because such is possible 

00:01:57.070 --> 00:02:01.869
 option that they are a little under fire 

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:03.060
 si then this country needs and the cheese is already there 

00:02:01.869 --> 00:02:08.110
 12 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:11.380
 out of order need to replace everything later 

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:14.910
 was on a cliff rather was on a cliff here 

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:17.980
 this throttle it goes for every right 

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:19.140
 one winding on that wire phase 

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:24.130
 to zero 

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:28.540
 she turned out to be working glad 

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:32.890
 fuse they sale them not but 

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:37.570
 familiar nest on giving you soldered here and 

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:38.260
 shot shot is not exactly a capacitor from 

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:42.459
 condensate 

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:43.060
 it's 400 all yours here is 47 

00:02:42.459 --> 00:02:45.549
 microfarad 

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:49.000
 and out of order and this one 

00:02:45.549 --> 00:02:52.690
 pwm controller also shot in general i 

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:57.910
 replaced this controller than all diodes and 

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:59.110
 the receiver choke was launched but it was 

00:02:57.910 --> 00:03:01.480
 such 

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:05.050
 there is such another problem well 

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:06.400
 rather, as if not quite yet 

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:10.900
 repaired well 

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:13.690
 repaired no signal scale top 

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:17.490
 tender and bottom on the receiver 

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:22.300
 on the TV menu 

00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:23.550
 sprinkled with squares and so it appeared 

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:26.760
 disappeared 

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:29.700
 signal level appear disappeared 

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:32.489
 helped helped 

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:35.450
 on the advice of a friend helped remember 

00:03:32.489 --> 00:03:40.610
 replacing this here's a capacitor 

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:44.550
 document this means 47 microfarad 200 

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:48.209
 days 404 xi microfarad and here after 

00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:53.760
 replacing a given capacitor a little bit 

00:03:48.209 --> 00:03:56.760
 I'll show you closer after replacing this 

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:59.459
 capacitor operability 

00:03:56.760 --> 00:04:07.410
 signal 2 has fully recovered 

00:03:59.459 --> 00:04:10.910
 Well, now enjoy watching more 

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:14.690
 so i want to tell myself that malfunction 

00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:17.729
 principle as it is not something that is typical well 

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:22.889
 the choke was not the case that they were burning 

00:04:17.729 --> 00:04:26.100
 understand here what's the point of this video yet 

00:04:22.889 --> 00:04:28.260
 I want to say that he worked he burned 

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:29.940
 fuse whole but it's not me 

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:32.460
 I know it was never the case 

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:34.350
 usually under karachi forehead something and 

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:36.479
 fuses last as always 

00:04:34.350 --> 00:04:43.070
 broke down well they say he is whole 

00:04:36.479 --> 00:04:47.820
 It turned out well and how everything on this 

00:04:43.070 --> 00:04:49.110
 maybe someone this video helped here in 

00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:51.690
 repair was delivered 

00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:55.530
 the purpose of repair they are buying a new unit 

00:04:51.690 --> 00:04:58.039
 since the weekend it happened on friday 

00:04:55.530 --> 00:05:01.590
 weekend well and without TV somehow 

00:04:58.039 --> 00:05:04.800
 I didnâ€™t want to stay 

00:05:01.590 --> 00:05:09.479
 decided to repair here well 

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:10.229
 so we all thank you for 

00:05:09.479 --> 00:05:12.510
 viewing 

00:05:10.229 --> 00:05:17.190
 if you were interested subscribe 

00:05:12.510 --> 00:05:19.280
 like to all good to 

00:05:17.190 --> 00:05:19.280
