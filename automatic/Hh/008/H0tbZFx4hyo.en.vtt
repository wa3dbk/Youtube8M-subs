00:00:02.290 --> 00:00:06.229
 hello how I'm pedro gomez from the workshop 

00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:07.879
 of espresso two times national champion 

00:00:06.229 --> 00:00:10.849
 in the Mexican competition baristas 

00:00:07.879 --> 00:00:12.860
 Now I am going to present to you how to do the 

00:00:10.849 --> 00:00:14.389
 perfect cappuccino very well for that 

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:16.070
 first we need to do with this 

00:00:14.389 --> 00:00:17.960
 express action 

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:20.300
 is what I'm going to do now is to remove 

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:22.430
 my filter holder of the rinsing machine 

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:24.439
 the shower that is very important because 

00:00:22.430 --> 00:00:26.779
 this will eliminate coffee waste 

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:28.160
 that we can have there the same time 

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:30.800
 we help to modulate the 

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:33.830
 temperature is important to clean the 

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:35.680
 filter how to dry the exits for 

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:38.629
 prevent at a given moment 

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:40.129
 moisten any area of ​​the bar a 

00:00:38.629 --> 00:00:42.379
 very important factor to make a 

00:00:40.129 --> 00:00:46.040
 perfect cappuccino is that our coffee 

00:00:42.379 --> 00:00:47.750
 be ground to the moment then this in 

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:49.910
 this case I call it something like 

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:54.110
 grind by service 

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:56.420
 alright then let's go now 

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:59.270
 we fill our filter holder with coffee 

00:00:56.420 --> 00:01:00.980
 freshly ground and we're going to start 

00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:03.800
 distribute it throughout the entire 

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:05.710
 filter in such a way that our filter 

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:10.060
 be completely covered in coffee 

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:10.060
 let's share the coffee 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:14.960
 this action of compacting coffee 

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:20.539
 will make the coffee offer a 

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:21.710
 natural resistance to water the moment 

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:24.079
 where he comes into contact with coffee 

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:25.560
 the coffee swells and starts to extract 

00:01:24.079 --> 00:01:28.600
 a 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:30.850
 a soft and delicate 

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:32.830
 creamy espresso extraction always 

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:35.770
 the filter holder is placed and so 

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:37.000
 immediate we make our extraction very 

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:38.590
 well the characteristics of this coffee 

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:42.380
 that we are using at this time 

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:44.590
 they are with is not healthy is 

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:48.429
 some candy 

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:50.619
 comes in the end a little vanilla and 

00:01:48.429 --> 00:01:53.039
 This will combine perfectly with 

00:01:50.619 --> 00:01:53.039
 our milk 

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:57.870
 on a recommendation in an extraction 

00:01:55.470 --> 00:02:01.260
 of average espresso is that this is 

00:01:57.870 --> 00:02:04.530
 oscillate in an approximate time of about 

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:06.000
 20 to 25 seconds approximately but 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:07.820
 well the most important thing is to get a 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:10.130
 good espresso extraction 

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:14.410
 the followed we will take our milk 

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:16.270
 fresh it is very important that it is cold 

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:20.550
 let's give it some texture that the 

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:20.550
 milk I was super creamy very jealous 

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:29.360
 very important always in the end you have to 

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:32.710
 clean the equipment so that it is 

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:36.140
 always be clean, well, have a 

00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:38.270
 long life time and let's give it a 

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:40.930
 decorative touch to our next 

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:40.930
 perfect 

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:55.110
