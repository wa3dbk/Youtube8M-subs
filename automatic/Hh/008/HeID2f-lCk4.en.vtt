00:00:43.990 --> 00:00:44.000 

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.279 

start<00:00:45.000> out<00:00:45.090> with<00:00:45.210> two<00:00:45.329> pieces<00:00:45.510> of<00:00:45.690> foam<00:00:45.930> about

00:00:46.279 --> 00:00:46.289 
start out with two pieces of foam about

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:53.389 
start out with two pieces of foam about
8<00:00:46.500> inches<00:00:46.680> in<00:00:46.980> size<00:00:47.160> 8<00:00:47.579> inches<00:00:47.879> square<00:00:52.399> and

00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:53.399 
8 inches in size 8 inches square and

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:55.400 
8 inches in size 8 inches square and
then<00:00:53.789> one<00:00:54.059> of<00:00:54.180> them<00:00:54.300> I<00:00:54.449> measure<00:00:54.780> out<00:00:54.870> a<00:00:55.020> measure

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:55.410 
then one of them I measure out a measure

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:59.319 
then one of them I measure out a measure
on<00:00:55.500> a<00:00:55.620> circle<00:00:56.420> that's<00:00:57.420> about<00:00:57.629> a<00:00:57.690> 6<00:00:57.899> inch<00:00:58.170> circle

00:00:59.319 --> 00:00:59.329 
on a circle that's about a 6 inch circle

00:00:59.329 --> 00:01:06.110 
on a circle that's about a 6 inch circle
then<00:01:00.329> I<00:01:00.420> cut<00:01:00.629> it<00:01:00.719> out

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:06.120 

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:08.030 

then<00:01:06.720> I<00:01:06.780> glue<00:01:06.990> them<00:01:07.110> together<00:01:07.290> just<00:01:07.530> like<00:01:07.740> that

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
then I glue them together just like that

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:10.640 
then I glue them together just like that
and<00:01:08.310> I<00:01:08.760> also<00:01:08.940> put<00:01:09.240> glue<00:01:09.630> in<00:01:09.660> that<00:01:10.080> gap<00:01:10.350> there

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
and I also put glue in that gap there

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:12.560 
and I also put glue in that gap there
all<00:01:10.980> the<00:01:11.160> way<00:01:11.280> around<00:01:11.550> to<00:01:11.760> seal<00:01:12.120> it<00:01:12.330> because

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
all the way around to seal it because

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:14.210 
all the way around to seal it because
we're<00:01:12.690> going<00:01:12.810> to<00:01:12.900> be<00:01:13.050> pouring<00:01:13.290> epoxy<00:01:13.830> resin<00:01:14.130> in

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
we're going to be pouring epoxy resin in

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:17.210 
we're going to be pouring epoxy resin in
there<00:01:14.400> so<00:01:15.120> the<00:01:15.240> easy<00:01:15.480> cast<00:01:15.840> epoxy<00:01:16.410> resin<00:01:16.740> it's

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
there so the easy cast epoxy resin it's

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:19.490 
there so the easy cast epoxy resin it's
in<00:01:17.370> two<00:01:17.490> parts<00:01:17.700> it's<00:01:18.060> easy<00:01:18.240> to<00:01:18.420> make<00:01:18.570> you<00:01:19.260> mix

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500 
in two parts it's easy to make you mix

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:29.540 
in two parts it's easy to make you mix
equal<00:01:19.710> parts<00:01:19.920> together

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:29.550 

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:31.370 

this<00:01:30.150> is<00:01:30.270> the<00:01:30.360> same<00:01:30.570> stuff<00:01:30.780> I<00:01:30.900> use<00:01:31.110> for<00:01:31.290> the

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 
this is the same stuff I use for the

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:41.010 
this is the same stuff I use for the
glass<00:01:31.560> sword<00:01:32.040> and<00:01:32.430> the<00:01:32.520> glass<00:01:32.790> dagger

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:41.020 

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:43.770

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:25.920 
clean it up a little bit so now we want

to<00:02:25.980> shape<00:02:26.160> it<00:02:26.310> to<00:02:26.430> the<00:02:26.550> actual<00:02:26.880> glass<00:02:27.270> shield

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:27.600 
to shape it to the actual glass shield

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:30.260 
to shape it to the actual glass shield
so<00:02:28.110> it<00:02:28.410> this<00:02:28.620> stuff<00:02:28.800> is<00:02:28.890> easy<00:02:29.070> to<00:02:29.220> work<00:02:29.310> with<00:02:29.370> so

now we need the ornamental work that
goes<00:03:01.630> on<00:03:01.870> top<00:03:02.080> of<00:03:02.140> it<00:03:02.380> like<00:03:02.500> that<00:03:02.970> so<00:03:03.970> I<00:03:04.000> drew<00:03:04.240> it

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:04.360 
goes on top of it like that so I drew it

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:20.199 
goes on top of it like that so I drew it
out<00:03:04.450> first<00:03:04.660> on<00:03:04.870> paper<00:03:06.720> cut<00:03:07.720> it<00:03:07.840> out

00:03:27.069 --> 00:03:27.079 
shape and size that I wanted then I use

00:03:27.079 --> 00:03:44.820 
shape and size that I wanted then I use
that<00:03:27.109> as<00:03:27.409> a<00:03:27.439> template<00:03:27.950> for<00:03:32.049> craft<00:03:33.049> foam

00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:44.830

me speak
that's<00:05:54.490> a<00:05:54.550> nice<00:05:54.699> stop-motion<00:05:55.240> animation

00:05:55.529 --> 00:05:55.539 
that's a nice stop-motion animation

00:05:55.539 --> 00:05:57.600 
that's a nice stop-motion animation
techniques<00:05:56.139> and<00:05:56.380> I<00:05:56.440> will<00:05:56.620> do<00:05:56.889> it<00:05:57.039> tutorial<00:05:57.460> on

00:05:57.600 --> 00:05:57.610
