00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 
little bit but it just started out just

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:22.550 
little bit but it just started out just
both<00:01:21.360> now<00:01:21.540> so<00:01:21.750> that's<00:01:21.930> good<00:01:21.990> because<00:01:22.290> you<00:01:22.470> know

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
both now so that's good because you know

both now so that's good because you know
I<00:01:22.590> like<00:01:22.830> trading<00:01:23.610> when<00:01:24.000> I<00:01:24.030> I<00:01:24.570> just<00:01:24.960> searched

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 
I like trading when I I just searched

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:26.390 
I like trading when I I just searched
through<00:01:25.320> a<00:01:25.380> bunch<00:01:25.530> of<00:01:25.650> stuff<00:01:25.860> and<00:01:26.040> then<00:01:26.189> add

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 
through a bunch of stuff and then add

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:28.399 
through a bunch of stuff and then add
them<00:01:26.520> to<00:01:26.700> my<00:01:26.820> watch<00:01:27.000> list<00:01:27.030> so<00:01:27.900> that<00:01:27.930> I<00:01:28.080> can<00:01:28.140> bid

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:28.409 
them to my watch list so that I can bid

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:30.830 
them to my watch list so that I can bid
on<00:01:28.439> them<00:01:28.619> later<00:01:29.090> so<00:01:30.090> that's<00:01:30.360> a<00:01:30.450> really<00:01:30.479> good

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 
on them later so that's a really good

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:32.390 
on them later so that's a really good
tactic<00:01:31.500> that<00:01:31.619> I<00:01:31.680> like<00:01:31.860> to<00:01:31.979> use<00:01:32.009> that<00:01:32.369> I

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:32.400 
tactic that I like to use that I

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:34.249 
tactic that I like to use that I
couldn't<00:01:32.759> do<00:01:32.850> it<00:01:32.939> but<00:01:33.630> as<00:01:33.810> you<00:01:33.930> can<00:01:34.049> see<00:01:34.229> a

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259 
couldn't do it but as you can see a
