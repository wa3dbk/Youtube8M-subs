has<00:00:29.590> been<00:00:29.680> done<00:00:29.919> I<00:00:30.279> ran<00:00:31.270> my<00:00:31.419> RCS<00:00:32.020> my<00:00:32.230> power<00:00:32.489> my

00:00:33.479 --> 00:00:33.489 
has been done I ran my RCS my power my

00:00:33.489 --> 00:00:35.520 
has been done I ran my RCS my power my
remote<00:00:33.790> wire<00:00:34.000> the<00:00:34.660> back<00:00:34.960> or<00:00:35.199> I'm<00:00:35.260> gonna<00:00:35.320> have

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:35.530 
remote wire the back or I'm gonna have

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:37.500 
remote wire the back or I'm gonna have
the<00:00:35.650> ABS

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:37.510 
the ABS

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:40.920 
the ABS
so<00:00:37.930> I<00:00:37.960> guess<00:00:38.200> the<00:00:38.320> next<00:00:38.500> job<00:00:38.829> would<00:00:38.980> be<00:00:39.010> to

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:40.930 
so I guess the next job would be to

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:42.900 
so I guess the next job would be to
just<00:00:41.620> do<00:00:41.740> a<00:00:41.770> little<00:00:42.040> bit<00:00:42.220> of<00:00:42.250> grounding<00:00:42.790> in<00:00:42.880> the

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:42.910 
just do a little bit of grounding in the

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:45.000 
just do a little bit of grounding in the
back<00:00:43.320> and<00:00:44.320> then<00:00:44.440> once<00:00:44.590> the<00:00:44.680> doors<00:00:44.890> are

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:45.010 
back and then once the doors are

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:47.930 
back and then once the doors are
finished<00:00:45.370> and<00:00:45.580> all<00:00:45.700> that<00:00:45.880> other<00:00:46.000> crap<00:00:46.330> I<00:00:46.510> can<00:00:46.750> I

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
finished and all that other crap I can I

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:51.270 
finished and all that other crap I can I
can<00:00:48.940> get<00:00:49.120> it<00:00:49.270> all<00:00:49.390> back<00:00:49.570> together<00:00:49.810> and<00:00:50.290> maybe

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:51.280 
can get it all back together and maybe

00:00:51.280 --> 00:01:02.340 
can get it all back together and maybe
actually<00:00:51.610> have<00:00:52.000> the<00:00:52.120> truck<00:00:52.390> that<00:00:52.570> I<00:00:52.660> can<00:00:53.520> use

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:02.350
