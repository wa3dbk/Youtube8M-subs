like now I thought that the best way to
go<00:01:54.759> about<00:01:54.790> this<00:01:54.970> would<00:01:55.690> be<00:01:55.810> 12<00:01:56.050> used<00:01:56.560> some

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:56.710 
go about this would be 12 used some

00:01:56.710 --> 00:01:59.100 
go about this would be 12 used some
screws<00:01:57.070> or<00:01:57.640> maybe<00:01:58.090> a<00:01:58.180> nail<00:01:58.450> or<00:01:58.479> something<00:01:58.840> like

00:01:59.100 --> 00:01:59.110 
screws or maybe a nail or something like

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:00.660 
screws or maybe a nail or something like
that<00:01:59.170> but<00:01:59.860> unfortunately<00:02:00.400> i<00:02:00.430> don't<00:02:00.550> have

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:00.670 
that but unfortunately i don't have

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:02.670

those handy so i'm going to improvise
and<00:02:03.009> i'm<00:02:03.130> going<00:02:03.400> to<00:02:03.520> be<00:02:03.610> using<00:02:03.850> two<00:02:04.420> colored
