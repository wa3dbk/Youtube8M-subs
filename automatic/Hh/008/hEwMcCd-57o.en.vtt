00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.450
 plus 

00:00:08.410 --> 00:00:15.260
 hello very good I am again the one of 

00:00:11.559 --> 00:00:18.730
 they always call me a teacher 

00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:21.869
 engineer point 

00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:25.150
 we continue with the classes of vectors 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:27.310
 I think there is this theory video and 

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:29.680
 another one and we finish with all the theory 

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:32.680
 of vectors and I will dedicate some videos 

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:34.930
 special only of exercises with many 

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:36.010
 rather more complicated exercises 

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:39.280
 what we have been doing up 

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:43.239
 now good today plays linear combination 

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:45.519
 of vectors and voters linearly 

00:00:43.239 --> 00:00:47.440
 dependent and independent that is 

00:00:45.519 --> 00:00:49.960
 everything very related everything is about 

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:52.480
 combination line then what is a 

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:54.789
 linear combination of vectors makes 

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:57.809
 It needs to be two or more vectors as 

00:00:54.789 --> 00:01:01.079
 is a vector that is obtained by adding 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:04.180
 those vectors multiplied by 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:08.360
 scalars what does this mean if I 

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:11.060
 I have two vectors v 

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:13.189
 and it's worth 

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:14.899
 if I multiply these two vectors by 

00:01:13.189 --> 00:01:16.800
 scalar scalars or the number of 

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:20.100
 remember 

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:22.590
 then I will get a linear combination 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:26.100
 of these two vectors for example this 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:27.980
 You need a cartoon I have and what is this 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:31.900
 teeny here 

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:34.470
 here I have v that is this long here 

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:37.950
 well, imagine 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:40.740
 that I now put here twice and see 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:47.250
 this is v and twice v and I put three 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:48.690
 times and twice and three times and the most 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:51.120
 as if I sumo grip the whereabouts 

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:53.820
 gram as 

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:56.240
 around here a parallel and here a 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:59.630
 parallel 

00:01:56.240 --> 00:02:03.450
 and this is the end point this vector of 

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:08.700
 here I will call him w 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:11.220
 that is a come up do not be here is 

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:14.400
 3 

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:16.800
 notice that I've put three or more here 

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:19.530
 twice and see what I put here 

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:23.430
 so 

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:26.250
 w is a linear combination of USA and 

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:29.760
 uve of idv in what proportion then in 

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:32.970
 three times and in two times v for example 

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:36.420
 I could also say w 

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:38.099
 is equal to more v 

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:41.130
 then this would also be a 

00:02:38.099 --> 00:02:43.950
 linear combination but clear because 

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:45.540
 scalars is multiplied and v then 

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:49.500
 is multiplied in this case by a 

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:52.080
 After one and for once and be that 

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:57.560
 is here for one 

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:57.560
 and v by 1 and the vector would be this 

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:03.519
 would be w in this case it would be a 

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:06.209
 linear combination of vdv but 

00:03:03.519 --> 00:03:08.680
 multiplied nothing more by one then 

00:03:06.209 --> 00:03:11.319
 well it's very simple I'm going to pass 

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:13.540
 explains explaining dependency 

00:03:11.319 --> 00:03:18.790
 independence but good before I leave you 

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:23.380
 the general formula v is equal to 1 

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:25.120
 for v 1 + 2 x v 2 

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:29.560
 plus 

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:33.989
 by an vn what this means for nothing 

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:33.989
 that v is a vector 

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:42.610
 linear combination of v1 dv2 idv n that 

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:46.360
 as many as we want and each one x a 

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:48.190
 climb worth that is combination line already 

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:50.830
 we will do exercises and nurses yet 

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:53.110
 more but let's go have no more now I'm going 

00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:55.590
 to explain what is dependence and 

00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:57.510
 independence 

00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:58.670
 which is very related to this, 

00:03:57.510 --> 00:04:01.420
 nothing 

00:03:58.670 --> 00:04:01.420
 let's see 

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:09.340
 of several free vectors are 

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:11.500
 dependent if there is a combination 

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:13.239
 linear as the thing ended up explaining how 

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:16.900
 the one that I just explained to you that is 

00:04:13.239 --> 00:04:22.960
 equal to zero is to say yes to one if to one 

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:26.520
 for v one more to two for v two more an 

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:26.520
 by vn is equal to zero 

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:34.460
 then we say that they are linearly 

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:34.460
 dependents 

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:40.170
 this implies that a vector 

00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:44.340
 if several vectors are linearly 

00:04:40.170 --> 00:04:46.200
 dependents you can put at least one 

00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:47.520
 of them as a linear combination of 

00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:49.590
 else does this mean for by 

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:54.690
 example the previous case the case that 

00:04:49.590 --> 00:05:00.180
 I have said that I told you that w was equal to 

00:04:54.690 --> 00:05:03.090
 three or more two v here we are putting w 

00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:05.010
 as a linear combination of idv because 

00:05:03.090 --> 00:05:07.860
 because they are linearly dependent and I 

00:05:05.010 --> 00:05:13.740
 step everything on the same side of the same could 

00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:16.050
 I would say that w minus three and minus two v is 

00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:17.730
 equal to zero you see and if it would be 

00:05:16.050 --> 00:05:20.640
 fulfilling this property here to one by 

00:05:17.730 --> 00:05:23.670
 v one more to two times v 2 + 3 times v 3 

00:05:20.640 --> 00:05:26.490
 would be equal to 0 where one would be 1 to 2 

00:05:23.670 --> 00:05:29.520
 it would be minus 3 and at 3 it would be minus 2 

00:05:26.490 --> 00:05:31.830
 you understand, that means that they are 

00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:34.800
 linearly dependent if I have two 

00:05:31.830 --> 00:05:37.669
 vectors for example 

00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:37.669
 2. 3 

00:05:38.639 --> 00:05:43.809
 46 it is verified that they are dependent 

00:05:41.860 --> 00:05:46.419
 dividing term at the end of 

00:05:43.809 --> 00:05:48.789
 X between the Xs 2 between 4 and then 

00:05:46.419 --> 00:05:50.349
 we speak to aziz between 6 and if this 

00:05:48.789 --> 00:05:51.969
 equality is fulfilled then they are 

00:05:50.349 --> 00:05:53.870
 linearly dependent we see that two 

00:05:51.969 --> 00:05:56.950
 rooms is a means 

00:05:53.870 --> 00:05:59.720
 and three sixths is also a means 

00:05:56.950 --> 00:06:01.490
 then how is it fulfilled 

00:05:59.720 --> 00:06:04.770
 are linearly dependent only happens 

00:06:01.490 --> 00:06:06.690
 for vÃ­ctor is that they are parallel 

00:06:04.770 --> 00:06:08.699
 when they are two vectors and then 

00:06:06.690 --> 00:06:11.099
 linearly independent vectors 

00:06:08.699 --> 00:06:15.680
 are those for which it is not met 

00:06:11.099 --> 00:06:18.210
 is this equality that here 

00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:21.629
 as when this happens, for example 

00:06:18.210 --> 00:06:24.629
 two vectors so do not be neither 

00:06:21.629 --> 00:06:26.759
 proportional nor whereabouts then 

00:06:24.629 --> 00:06:29.849
 you will never be able to fulfill that one 

00:06:26.759 --> 00:06:32.789
 let one be told by v 1 what would this be 

00:06:29.849 --> 00:06:35.009
 plus 2 for v 2 to 1 is a number of a 2 is 

00:06:32.789 --> 00:06:38.400
 another number could never be achieved 

00:06:35.009 --> 00:06:41.240
 that is equal to 0 or what is the same 

00:06:38.400 --> 00:06:44.190
 we would say that several vectors are 

00:06:41.240 --> 00:06:46.680
 linearly independent without any 

00:06:44.190 --> 00:06:50.460
 of them can be put as a combination 

00:06:46.680 --> 00:06:53.960
 linear of the remaining good would happen 

00:06:50.460 --> 00:06:58.280
 for example the vector 5 2 

00:06:53.960 --> 00:07:02.300
 and the vector 31 we divide ends term 

00:06:58.280 --> 00:07:04.190
 5 between 3 is equal to 2 between 1 because not 

00:07:02.300 --> 00:07:06.380
 because five thirds is not equal to two 

00:07:04.190 --> 00:07:08.889
 then equality is not met 

00:07:06.380 --> 00:07:10.610
 then linearly independent you see 

00:07:08.889 --> 00:07:13.099
 when here they were linearly 

00:07:10.610 --> 00:07:14.900
 dependents good and I will do exercises 

00:07:13.099 --> 00:07:17.210
 about this anyway is very 

00:07:14.900 --> 00:07:19.639
 simple so it seems a little abstract 

00:07:17.210 --> 00:07:22.789
 but I already leave here the link to the 

00:07:19.639 --> 00:07:24.770
 exercises so what so that what 

00:07:22.789 --> 00:07:27.650
 you see but this is the theory and it does not have 

00:07:24.770 --> 00:07:30.820
 have no more have a greeting and open 

00:07:27.650 --> 00:07:30.820
 those little heads
