 hello that everything for people like we are that 

00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:23.949
 like 50 and we're in the new video 

00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:26.770
 replay commented on world of tanks where 

00:00:23.949 --> 00:00:28.029
 comment of 59 in europe with the already we are going 

00:00:26.770 --> 00:00:30.160
 to try to make a battle as 

00:00:28.029 --> 00:00:33.460
 recent possible we are already going with the Chinese or 

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:36.129
 Chinese but good we're going to go for 

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:38.500
 the typical hill this more for the 

00:00:36.129 --> 00:00:41.290
 means when you go here to the right we put 

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:43.570
 the tank move and we go over there 

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:45.400
 when I count 59 with the prices 

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:46.449
 because I need pasta pasta pasta I have 

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:50.710
 to put together pasta that I like 

00:00:46.449 --> 00:00:51.940
 premium that I already have the 32 where to meet 

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:54.910
 that is good geek is left me 

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:56.440
 40,000 experience points but 

00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:58.390
 we are in it and I already have almost 

00:00:56.440 --> 00:01:01.570
 developed I'm missing 10,000 points or 

00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:04.269
 something less for the and his 152 the 

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:06.159
 antitank has 8 soviet 

00:01:04.269 --> 00:01:08.679
 and so we can soon put new 

00:01:06.159 --> 00:01:10.030
 tanks good here we are reaching the 

00:01:08.679 --> 00:01:11.530
 medium gas to the hill start at 

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:13.990
 eat enemies there we throw is to say that 

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:15.909
 this tank for distance of carafes 

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:18.009
 of very good bolts that your cannon is not 

00:01:15.909 --> 00:01:19.539
 very very accurate of distant cancer and 

00:01:18.009 --> 00:01:21.909
 they take quite a long time the reticle car 

00:01:19.539 --> 00:01:23.590
 which is a tank for battles to face 

00:01:21.909 --> 00:01:26.229
 dog is to say as high as possible that 

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:27.640
 you can without receiving the milk you have 

00:01:26.229 --> 00:01:29.110
 good enemies here we are on the hill 

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:31.450
 we have arrived before them what I am going 

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:33.060
 to do is stay here to fight in 

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:36.189
 the middle I'm going to the back 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:37.689
 has a back part and we're going to 

00:01:36.189 --> 00:01:39.700
 try to look for the objectives so we 

00:01:37.689 --> 00:01:41.920
 we cover a little bit we see that in europe 

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:44.500
 there's an artillery so what are we going 

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:46.569
 to do is to try to protect the airy and 

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:48.880
 that 3 who has seen it at least I was 

00:01:46.569 --> 00:01:50.470
 has it been not focused on me and you 

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:52.810
 we will speak some impact some impact 

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:55.220
 by lahm the ass and satrap and satraps 

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:56.720
 and if I already know that I have been painted 

00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:57.980
 well what happens that being in this 

00:01:56.720 --> 00:01:59.300
 position what we have to have in 

00:01:57.980 --> 00:02:00.680
 account that from the back also 

00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:05.510
 can shoot it 

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:07.970
 in the case of the small one and this one we see 

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:10.130
 that goes down so nothing we're going to take 

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:12.950
 10 enters the ass and we put 

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:16.750
 a suppository we carry 

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:20.020
 We have been carrying we have what we have 

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:20.020
 let's give 

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:25.340
 in fact 15 points of damage this is a 

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:28.430
 side lamela month has not been unintentional 

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:30.860
 had to kill him is what behind the 

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:34.630
 channel shoots from behind we fail you there 

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:34.630
 at 17 they will be pretty alone 

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:39.980
 we hope here and here we have three 

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:42.890
 so let's go there to continue here 

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:45.680
 finding the hill the moment next to 

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:47.480
 the others that keeps shooting me do not 

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:50.709
 I see so you have to remove it here 

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:53.540
 fast and fast and avoid their impacts 

00:02:50.709 --> 00:02:55.580
 milk we take the losses well with 500 of 

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:56.840
 year 500 fair years and two losses by 

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:58.930
 restore it 

00:02:56.840 --> 00:03:00.710
 the times is type door 

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:04.010
 fairly good 

00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:06.290
 and premium as well as this one we're going to see for 

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:08.030
 the table with 30,000 clean that makes us 

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:11.120
 bad the truth to be is to play without 

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:16.130
 premium that you want you want good in 

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:17.900
 this moment if we see that we are not 

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:20.390
 useful so let's go now is the 

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:21.980
 today or we get moving and we 

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:23.630
 we go towards the enemy states that 

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:26.630
 here we have come to see the landscape but 

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:28.670
 when we fight we go there first piece that 

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:30.560
 let's shoot the 85 of course not 

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:33.470
 you are thinking because it will be enough 

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:35.300
 behind the reticle and the cannon or very 

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:37.130
 I must have seen the bullet 

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:38.390
 even at a distance not too far away and 

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:40.440
 that you have to be very careful with 

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:42.540
 this attack at the time of aiming 

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:47.580
 and we have to take into account that 

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:50.160
 small that little data there is 3 orion I'm going 

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:51.720
 to get here by mixing the trough this 

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:53.340
 to hide the tank a little bit because 

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:55.050
 suddenly they give us the soma and the iso of 

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:57.120
 52 and as I said I have enough 

00:03:55.050 --> 00:03:59.880
 close soon I hope to have it already 

00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:04.640
 operational and see if I can get 

00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:09.090
 fast its 155 meter cannon the 

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:11.190
 first assignment that will be quite 

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:12.720
 they described val fired once 

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:17.730
 he said that it has enough deviation 

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:19.109
 fix the point there is good this other and 

00:04:17.730 --> 00:04:20.820
 in this just when I'm aiming 

00:04:19.109 --> 00:04:22.680
 to shoot you has a way of 

00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:24.000
 move and willem in the mante del canÃ³n 

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:26.250
 thus not get to see the year 

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:27.770
 second shot because I also did not 

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:31.100
 he managed to do but we have gotten good 

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:31.100
 the artillery 

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:36.990
 of the canyon that was quite protected 

00:04:34.970 --> 00:04:38.639
 what we follow is once 

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:40.530
 let's prepare 

00:04:38.639 --> 00:04:45.120
 we adapt the base we have to advance the 

00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:48.419
 base and move here we have come 1 759 

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:49.680
 has eight Chinese premium tank that 

00:04:48.419 --> 00:04:52.669
 It is not nothing special either but 

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:52.669
 does not add to the tank the truth 

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:59.620
 let's go up here, we're winning 

00:04:56.210 --> 00:05:02.569
 10 7 the game the time it is not very 

00:04:59.620 --> 00:05:04.370
 very definite yet but let's go 

00:05:02.569 --> 00:05:05.870
 talking about how important we have three 

00:05:04.370 --> 00:05:08.229
 of advantage over the enemy with which 

00:05:05.870 --> 00:05:10.520
 these three because of giving us the 

00:05:08.229 --> 00:05:12.090
 enough confidence to be able to 

00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:14.880
 the match 

00:05:12.090 --> 00:05:16.919
 so we went up here up where x 

00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:19.860
 50 100 you will discover artillery and you 

00:05:16.919 --> 00:05:21.440
 he's going to do it for him I already worry 

00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:24.320
 the artillery 

00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:25.580
 we keep going up and you see that it costs 

00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:27.170
 a little bit more than 20 kilometers 

00:05:25.580 --> 00:05:31.060
 per hour but well it's not that either 

00:05:27.170 --> 00:05:33.820
 is it going fast in the world this 

00:05:31.060 --> 00:05:36.450
 and we have the theory being destroyed by 

00:05:33.820 --> 00:05:40.050
 the x 50 with which we will live 

00:05:36.450 --> 00:05:43.360
 our life what I'm going to do now 

00:05:40.050 --> 00:05:45.160
 1 out of 1 million comes out 

00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:47.740
 so let's look there are three bubbles in 

00:05:45.160 --> 00:05:50.740
 move then auto aim fired him 

00:05:47.740 --> 00:05:52.510
 as well as point today we're going connecticut 

00:05:50.740 --> 00:05:54.310
 the mind of movement is a shot this 

00:05:52.510 --> 00:05:57.880
 shot you see one in a million or not 

00:05:54.310 --> 00:05:58.180
 I say good but it has come out we have not 

00:05:57.880 --> 00:06:00.280
 fact 

00:05:58.180 --> 00:06:03.370
 the gel that we have got we have three 

00:06:00.280 --> 00:06:05.590
 bearish there since there is the tiger 2 and already 

00:06:03.370 --> 00:06:07.419
 There is only one tank left, I tell him that 721 

00:06:05.590 --> 00:06:09.160
 you are marked to which we will go 

00:06:07.419 --> 00:06:11.590
 directly to put and we're going to 

00:06:09.160 --> 00:06:13.720
 get destroy and it will be our fourth 

00:06:11.590 --> 00:06:16.090
 low and last the game to put we are going to 

00:06:13.720 --> 00:06:18.040
 put the plant the direct we jump 

00:06:16.090 --> 00:06:20.860
 down here and we're going to 

00:06:18.040 --> 00:06:26.840
 instruct an interactive way define 

00:06:20.860 --> 00:06:28.669
 in motion and with impact we will see 

00:06:26.840 --> 00:06:29.750
 and that's how the game ends guys 

00:06:28.669 --> 00:06:31.520
 so you know if you liked the 

00:06:29.750 --> 00:06:36.280
 favorite video is to share it and we 

00:06:31.520 --> 00:06:36.280
 we see in the next game 

00:06:37.260 --> 00:06:39.320
 ah 

00:06:42.100 --> 00:06:44.580
 ah
