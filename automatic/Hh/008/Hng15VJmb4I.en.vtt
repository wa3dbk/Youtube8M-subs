00:01:24.979 --> 00:01:30.720
 You have shadow wars that is really cool. 

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:35.369
 stink on the map even the map of the 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:37.500
 uepb is also a little something 

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:42.210
 transmission on the map is very dynamic world 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:43.860
 open these here are these missions here 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:46.710
 attack and deliver 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:49.020
 are missions in niches nec missions 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:53.899
 have come out of bugs here that 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:53.899
 the little things come out of the bug 

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:02.190
 these places where the boys are 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:04.050
 zac falls red business that are 

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:06.390
 artifacts you watched the show or read 

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:09.899
 some of the game has a story here 

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:11.670
 can only be fragments of the ships that 

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:13.860
 fell out of the sky, right? 

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:15.480
 so here is an air of tail 

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:17.519
 Xuxa 

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:18.900
 these other yellow ones in cd quest that is 

00:02:17.519 --> 00:02:20.850
 the exclamation point that point 

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:23.010
 asterisks who wants to deliver quest 

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:25.140
 are all other types of mission by 

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:27.330
 example at what time do you enter here? 

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:28.470
 is essential for the same place only 

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:30.570
 It is associated 

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:32.400
 Do you have time to do something? 

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:34.980
 time will of readiness 

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:36.600
 mitchell is running a time to run from 

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:40.230
 a place to a place 

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:41.730
 for example here hotshot has to kill 

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:43.950
 both of people 

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:46.440
 here you have the fish should also be from 

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:49.350
 killing you have several missions nearby 

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:50.430
 without a miss is quests mission lines in 

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:52.950
 map you can do how many times 

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:55.260
 you want and when you do for example 

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:56.910
 time holder is the time you go 

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:58.560
 register your own temple of the team 

00:02:56.910 --> 00:03:00.239
 took off from this mission 

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:03.540
 you see the size of other people who 

00:03:00.239 --> 00:03:07.109
 They were in the same place here, so it's 

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:09.810
 have the ruler the scores of missions as 

00:03:07.109 --> 00:03:11.760
 missions here and have the main quests 

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:14.579
 and the side quests stuff does not know the 

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:16.230
 normal as any better this 

00:03:14.579 --> 00:03:18.030
 blue business does not know what to think 

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:19.320
 shadow wars i'm not sure not 

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:21.180
 no it 's not 

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:22.650
 It's been a long time since the game was over. 

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:26.190
 I do not know, and I do not know. 

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:30.000
 good to the right places, well let's go 

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:32.370
 to go to ignorance is cool bug o 

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.760
 cool bar from here that I liked is the guns 

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:37.000
 face 

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:39.519
 maybe I find the water shortcut here 

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:42.159
 here only two weapons support can 

00:03:39.519 --> 00:03:44.560
 change your shields has your vehicle 

00:03:42.159 --> 00:03:46.959
 And there you have your pecs the pec is your trail 

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:49.989
 you get points the defender trail 

00:03:46.959 --> 00:03:52.420
 so here it is I started by staying 

00:03:49.989 --> 00:03:54.610
 invisible this fall of 15 

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:57.069
 running is not that it will happen that if 

00:03:54.610 --> 00:04:01.930
 multiply this drop in charge more 

00:03:57.069 --> 00:04:07.180
 powerful here you have the reputation of 

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:09.609
 squirrels which have the status of the weapons 

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:11.560
 I'm using a lot of example I look 

00:04:09.609 --> 00:04:14.980
 I used a lot of lack of pace, level 7 

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:17.260
 in salt riff salt it got me to use it 

00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:18.880
 I'll have this pull of your clothes. 

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:22.860
 used for example has a high level of 

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:30.310
 fashion the ten weapons of fashion 

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:33.060

00:05:06.370 --> 00:05:10.650
 the video has been coming out okay 

00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:43.320
 the guy is confusing the button here 

00:05:48.960 --> 00:06:02.770
 good for me it's my mission and I'm going 

00:05:53.830 --> 00:06:03.820

00:06:02.770 --> 00:06:06.700

00:06:20.540 --> 00:06:26.770
 the proof has to be cool dance of 10 

00:06:23.150 --> 00:06:26.770
 years can not stand 

00:06:37.430 --> 00:06:40.430
 over there 

00:06:43.969 --> 00:06:48.739
