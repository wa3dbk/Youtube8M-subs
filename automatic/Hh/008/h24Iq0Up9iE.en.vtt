00:00:18.610 --> 00:00:23.710
 this game is pretty light just 

00:00:21.010 --> 00:00:25.870
 It weighs approximately 53 megabytes and requires 

00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:28.180
 of a top 2.3 android version 

00:00:25.870 --> 00:00:29.920
 to be able to function in terms of 

00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:31.990
 hardware requirements that we need 

00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:33.940
 to be able to run this game the most 

00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:35.710
 It is advisable to at least have a 

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:37.870
 device that has a processor 

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:39.670
 at a hertz giga and 512 megs of ram 

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:41.290
 although it may work for them in 

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:44.020
 devices that have hardware 

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:45.400
 lower than the mentioned day in case of 

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:47.410
 who want to check compatibility with 

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:49.000
 their devices on my website 

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:50.379
 I will be leaving a link to the

00:00:50.379 --> 00:00:55.489
 compatibility with your devices 

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:57.380
 this game has a price of 37 pesos 

00:00:55.489 --> 00:00:59.090
 Mexicans approximately 

00:00:57.380 --> 00:01:01.190
 so if you like, you can also buy 

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:02.960

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:04.910
 Also on my website they will be able to 

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:06.650
 find the files that we need 

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:09.260

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:10.340
 what are the data happens and the apk well 

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:12.080
 that once we have downloaded the 

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:13.820
 files the first thing we have to 

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:16.700
 do is move the folder that contains 

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:19.729
 the data s from the game to the sd route 

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:22.100

00:01:19.729 --> 00:01:23.509
 folder we paste them and now just 

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:25.790

00:01:23.509 --> 00:01:27.229
 and once it's finished installing already 

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:30.200
 we can open the game without any 

00:01:27.229 --> 00:01:32.000
 problem the game is offline so no 

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:34.820
 we will need no connection whatsoever 

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:36.200
 to internet to play as you see in 

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:38.330
 the game we not only see on a stage 

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:40.070
 of the open world which we will have to 

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:43.160
 go exploring and collecting weapons 

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:44.780

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:46.430
 which we will be helping for 

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:48.170
 to be able to survive before the horde of 

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:50.619
 zombies that will appear during 

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:50.619

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:09.240
 the game has some graphics 

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:11.459

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:13.680
 nine different types of zombies and

 first person view and with a mode 

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:22.230
 of view in third person so what 

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:24.480
 we can play in fps or tps mode 

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:27.000

 the view mode between fps and tps what 

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:33.750
 we will do using the button that says 3d the 

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:35.580
 which is on the right side of the 

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:37.650
 screen 

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:39.360
 As for the gameplay we will have a 

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:40.860
 virtual joystick on the left side of 

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:43.260
 the screen and the right side 

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:44.970

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:49.550

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:52.440
 actions like jump shoot and aim 

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:54.270
 as well as on top of 

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:56.580
 the screen will have a radar that we 

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:58.230
