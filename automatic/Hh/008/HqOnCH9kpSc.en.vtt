technician and I wanted to show you a
systematic<00:00:18.660> approach<00:00:19.070> this<00:00:20.070> is<00:00:20.220> a<00:00:20.250> better

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:20.550 
systematic approach this is a better

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:23.240 
systematic approach this is a better
approach<00:00:20.880> rather<00:00:21.180> than<00:00:21.380> just<00:00:22.380> throwing<00:00:22.560> parts

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:23.250 
approach rather than just throwing parts

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:25.189 
approach rather than just throwing parts
at<00:00:23.430> it<00:00:23.640> I<00:00:23.820> had<00:00:24.150> this<00:00:24.300> vehicle<00:00:24.510> towed<00:00:24.900> from<00:00:25.080> my

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:25.199 
at it I had this vehicle towed from my

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:27.589 
at it I had this vehicle towed from my
work<00:00:25.439> to<00:00:25.830> my<00:00:26.130> garage<00:00:26.310> people<00:00:27.300> are<00:00:27.359> like<00:00:27.480> Oh

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:29.400 
Steve you try let's try that I'm like

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:31.400 
Steve you try let's try that I'm like
y'all<00:00:29.580> diagnose<00:00:30.090> it<00:00:30.269> and<00:00:30.330> let<00:00:30.449> you<00:00:30.570> know<00:00:30.689> so

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:31.410 
y'all diagnose it and let you know so

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:33.470 
y'all diagnose it and let you know so
here's<00:00:31.679> the<00:00:31.769> step<00:00:31.980> through<00:00:32.399> a<00:00:32.579> process<00:00:33.210> I<00:00:33.300> went

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:33.480 
here's the step through a process I went

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:34.670 
here's the step through a process I went
through<00:00:33.660> this<00:00:33.870> truck<00:00:34.110> for<00:00:34.260> a<00:00:34.290> couple<00:00:34.500> of<00:00:34.530> years

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:34.680 
through this truck for a couple of years

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:37.610 
through this truck for a couple of years
of<00:00:34.950> a<00:00:35.550> couple<00:00:35.880> of<00:00:35.940> starter<00:00:36.329> issues<00:00:36.690> and<00:00:36.960> what

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:37.620 
of a couple of starter issues and what

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:39.920 
of a couple of starter issues and what
I'll<00:00:37.739> do<00:00:37.920> is<00:00:37.950> I'll<00:00:38.430> start<00:00:38.820> at<00:00:39.239> the<00:00:39.300> start<00:00:39.809> oh

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930 
I'll do is I'll start at the start oh

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:41.990 
I'll do is I'll start at the start oh
really<00:00:40.140> so<00:00:40.980> if<00:00:41.100> you<00:00:41.219> look<00:00:41.430> at<00:00:41.579> the<00:00:41.640> starter

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.000 
really so if you look at the starter

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:43.580 
really so if you look at the starter
really<00:00:42.329> here<00:00:42.540> you<00:00:42.690> can<00:00:42.809> see<00:00:42.989> on<00:00:43.079> the<00:00:43.170> vehicle

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:43.590 
really here you can see on the vehicle

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:45.590 
really here you can see on the vehicle
it's<00:00:44.070> just<00:00:44.280> that<00:00:44.399> it's<00:00:44.789> a<00:00:44.879> middle<00:00:45.180> really<00:00:45.360> in

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600 
it's just that it's a middle really in

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:48.290 
it's just that it's a middle really in
that<00:00:45.750> firewall<00:00:46.289> if<00:00:46.950> you<00:00:47.129> disconnect<00:00:47.550> that<00:00:47.789> you

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300 
that firewall if you disconnect that you

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:50.150 
that firewall if you disconnect that you
can<00:00:48.660> get<00:00:48.989> on<00:00:49.079> the<00:00:49.289> side<00:00:49.530> you'll<00:00:49.739> see<00:00:49.770> there's<00:00:50.100> a

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160 
can get on the side you'll see there's a

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:52.400 
can get on the side you'll see there's a
couple<00:00:50.280> of<00:00:50.520> wires<00:00:50.969> here<00:00:51.110> now<00:00:52.110> there's<00:00:52.320> a

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410 
couple of wires here now there's a

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:55.250 
couple of wires here now there's a
yellow<00:00:52.649> wire<00:00:52.949> that<00:00:53.460> comes<00:00:53.699> via<00:00:54.329> the<00:00:54.840> ignition

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
yellow wire that comes via the ignition

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:58.119 
yellow wire that comes via the ignition
switch<00:00:55.530> and<00:00:56.149> the<00:00:57.149> neutral<00:00:57.480> safety<00:00:57.660> switch

00:00:58.119 --> 00:00:58.129 
switch and the neutral safety switch

00:00:58.129 --> 00:01:01.069 
switch and the neutral safety switch
there's<00:00:59.129> the<00:00:59.399> red<00:01:00.270> wire<00:01:00.510> which<00:01:00.840> is<00:01:00.989> the

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079 
there's the red wire which is the

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:03.740 
there's the red wire which is the
12-volt<00:01:01.530> feed<00:01:01.829> and<00:01:02.100> there's<00:01:02.969> the<00:01:03.120> purple<00:01:03.600> wire

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
12-volt feed and there's the purple wire

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:06.859 
12-volt feed and there's the purple wire
this<00:01:04.350> purple<00:01:04.769> wire<00:01:04.979> actually<00:01:05.519> goes<00:01:05.729> to<00:01:06.119> the

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:06.869 
this purple wire actually goes to the

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:10.070 
this purple wire actually goes to the
solenoid<00:01:07.380> on<00:01:07.680> the<00:01:07.740> starter<00:01:08.159> motor<00:01:08.780> so<00:01:09.780> really

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080 
solenoid on the starter motor so really

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:11.719 
solenoid on the starter motor so really
this<00:01:10.200> is<00:01:10.260> like<00:01:10.380> using<00:01:10.650> a<00:01:10.830> half<00:01:11.010> split<00:01:11.340> method

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729 
this is like using a half split method

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:13.850 
this is like using a half split method
that<00:01:12.000> this<00:01:12.180> comport<00:01:12.720> is<00:01:12.840> easy<00:01:13.080> to<00:01:13.229> get<00:01:13.409> to<00:01:13.439> and

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
that this comport is easy to get to and

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:15.920 
that this comport is easy to get to and
I'll<00:01:14.280> use<00:01:14.460> this<00:01:14.580> as<00:01:14.640> a<00:01:14.790> base<00:01:15.030> for<00:01:15.180> my<00:01:15.240> diagnosis

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930 
I'll use this as a base for my diagnosis

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:17.660 
I'll use this as a base for my diagnosis
so<00:01:16.500> the<00:01:16.590> first<00:01:16.770> thing<00:01:16.950> I<00:01:17.040> will<00:01:17.159> do<00:01:17.310> I<00:01:17.549> will

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
so the first thing I will do I will

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:22.219 
so the first thing I will do I will
stick<00:01:17.939> ammeter<00:01:18.240> on<00:01:18.680> that<00:01:19.710> yellow<00:01:20.580> wire<00:01:21.229> just

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:22.229 
stick ammeter on that yellow wire just

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:24.020 
stick ammeter on that yellow wire just
put<00:01:22.409> a<00:01:22.439> negative<00:01:22.680> on<00:01:22.979> the<00:01:23.070> battery<00:01:23.430> put<00:01:24.000> a

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
put a negative on the battery put a

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:25.789 
put a negative on the battery put a
meter<00:01:24.240> on<00:01:24.330> there<00:01:24.659> and<00:01:24.900> when<00:01:25.080> I<00:01:25.110> go<00:01:25.350> to<00:01:25.409> the<00:01:25.560> run

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:25.799 
meter on there and when I go to the run

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:28.310 
meter on there and when I go to the run
on<00:01:26.070> the<00:01:26.310> ignition<00:01:26.520> I'm<00:01:26.850> looking<00:01:27.540> for<00:01:27.689> 12<00:01:27.930> volts

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
on the ignition I'm looking for 12 volts

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:31.100 
on the ignition I'm looking for 12 volts
I<00:01:28.530> have<00:01:29.220> a<00:01:29.250> diagram<00:01:29.670> I'm<00:01:29.939> going<00:01:30.119> through<00:01:30.299> throw

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110 
I have a diagram I'm going through throw

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:32.420 
I have a diagram I'm going through throw
out<00:01:31.229> your<00:01:31.380> short<00:01:31.619> lane<00:01:31.770> you<00:01:31.860> can<00:01:32.009> take<00:01:32.189> a<00:01:32.220> look

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:32.430 
out your short lane you can take a look

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:34.609 
out your short lane you can take a look
so<00:01:33.119> that's<00:01:33.270> the<00:01:33.360> first<00:01:33.570> diagnosis<00:01:34.200> if<00:01:34.350> you<00:01:34.439> got

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:34.619 
so that's the first diagnosis if you got

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:37.310 
so that's the first diagnosis if you got
if<00:01:34.860> you<00:01:34.979> do<00:01:35.189> not<00:01:35.369> have<00:01:35.640> 12<00:01:35.939> volts<00:01:36.329> on<00:01:36.509> that

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:37.320 
if you do not have 12 volts on that

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:40.850 
if you do not have 12 volts on that
yellow<00:01:38.509> wire<00:01:39.509> then<00:01:40.140> you're<00:01:40.380> looking<00:01:40.530> up

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860 
yellow wire then you're looking up

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:42.620 
yellow wire then you're looking up
tracing<00:01:41.310> it<00:01:41.430> back<00:01:41.460> through<00:01:42.240> the<00:01:42.360> wiring

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:42.630 
tracing it back through the wiring

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:45.469 
tracing it back through the wiring
through<00:01:43.590> the<00:01:43.740> ignition<00:01:44.130> switch<00:01:44.430> and<00:01:44.700> the

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:45.479 
through the ignition switch and the

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:49.639 
through the ignition switch and the
neutral<00:01:45.899> safety<00:01:46.320> switch<00:01:46.770> okay<00:01:47.390> we<00:01:48.390> do<00:01:48.600> have<00:01:48.649> 12

00:01:49.639 --> 00:01:49.649 
neutral safety switch okay we do have 12

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:52.639 
neutral safety switch okay we do have 12
volts<00:01:49.740> on<00:01:50.070> that<00:01:50.220> wire<00:01:50.430> okay<00:01:51.000> what<00:01:51.390> next<00:01:51.780> what

00:01:52.639 --> 00:01:52.649 
volts on that wire okay what next what

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:55.010 
volts on that wire okay what next what
we<00:01:52.799> do<00:01:52.950> then<00:01:53.159> we<00:01:53.399> look<00:01:53.579> to<00:01:53.700> see<00:01:53.909> do<00:01:54.540> we<00:01:54.570> have<00:01:54.750> 12

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020 
we do then we look to see do we have 12

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:57.530 
we do then we look to see do we have 12
volts<00:01:55.140> on<00:01:55.649> the<00:01:55.710> purple<00:01:56.310> wire<00:01:56.490> which<00:01:56.939> feeds<00:01:57.270> the

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:57.540 
volts on the purple wire which feeds the

00:01:57.540 --> 00:01:59.389 
volts on the purple wire which feeds the
solenoid<00:01:58.020> all<00:01:58.799> right

00:01:59.389 --> 00:01:59.399 
solenoid all right

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:02.300 
solenoid all right
we<00:01:59.700> have<00:01:59.820> 12<00:02:00.149> volts<00:02:00.450> on<00:02:00.630> that<00:02:01.590> solenoid<00:02:02.070> wire

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:02.310 
we have 12 volts on that solenoid wire

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:05.780 
we have 12 volts on that solenoid wire
we<00:02:03.270> trace<00:02:03.540> it<00:02:03.570> down<00:02:03.869> to<00:02:04.350> the<00:02:04.469> starter<00:02:04.890> so<00:02:05.610> what

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:05.790 
we trace it down to the starter so what

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:07.039 
we trace it down to the starter so what
were<00:02:05.909> left<00:02:05.939> with<00:02:06.210> we're<00:02:06.630> left<00:02:06.780> with<00:02:06.960> the

guys so sorry about the shadows so here
we<00:02:42.810> have<00:02:42.990> the<00:02:43.650> starter<00:02:44.070> really<00:02:44.430> you<00:02:44.670> can<00:02:44.820> see

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:45.060 
we have the starter really you can see

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:47.750 
we have the starter really you can see
I've<00:02:45.330> got<00:02:46.140> P<00:02:46.590> for<00:02:46.830> the<00:02:46.890> probe<00:02:47.130> point<00:02:47.370> this<00:02:47.610> is

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:47.760 
I've got P for the probe point this is

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:48.710 
I've got P for the probe point this is
where<00:02:47.880> you're<00:02:48.000> going<00:02:48.090> to<00:02:48.180> start<00:02:48.330> your<00:02:48.510> meter

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:48.720 
where you're going to start your meter

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:51.320 
where you're going to start your meter
all<00:02:48.990> right<00:02:49.200> and<00:02:49.410> then<00:02:50.130> there's<00:02:50.700> actually<00:02:50.910> the

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:51.330 
all right and then there's actually the

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:53.440 
all right and then there's actually the
input<00:02:51.450> there<00:02:51.870> which<00:02:52.500> is<00:02:52.650> this<00:02:52.800> yellow<00:02:53.010> wire

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:53.450 
input there which is this yellow wire

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:56.030 
input there which is this yellow wire
the<00:02:54.450> input<00:02:54.750> comes<00:02:55.020> via<00:02:55.230> the<00:02:55.380> neutral<00:02:55.680> safety

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:56.040 
the input comes via the neutral safety

00:02:56.040 --> 00:03:00.110 
the input comes via the neutral safety
switch<00:02:56.280> on<00:02:56.580> the<00:02:57.480> ignition<00:02:57.540> switch<00:02:58.520> okay<00:02:59.520> and

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:00.120 
switch on the ignition switch okay and

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:02.300 
switch on the ignition switch okay and
then<00:03:00.810> obviously<00:03:01.110> the<00:03:01.410> neutral<00:03:01.830> safety<00:03:01.950> switch

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:02.310 
then obviously the neutral safety switch

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:04.970 
then obviously the neutral safety switch
it's<00:03:03.030> going<00:03:03.240> to<00:03:03.300> be<00:03:03.440> contacted<00:03:04.440> when<00:03:04.710> you're<00:03:04.950> a

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:04.980 
it's going to be contacted when you're a

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:07.790 
it's going to be contacted when you're a
park<00:03:05.250> initial<00:03:05.760> and<00:03:06.380> stating<00:03:07.380> you're<00:03:07.500> visiting

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:07.800 
park initial and stating you're visiting

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:09.920 
park initial and stating you're visiting
this<00:03:07.950> is<00:03:08.010> which<00:03:08.280> is<00:03:08.460> when<00:03:08.580> you<00:03:08.670> go<00:03:08.760> to<00:03:08.820> run<00:03:09.060> so

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:09.930 
this is which is when you go to run so

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:11.840 
this is which is when you go to run so
basically<00:03:10.290> you<00:03:10.470> have<00:03:10.620> 12<00:03:10.950> volts<00:03:11.010> are<00:03:11.610> the

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:11.850 
basically you have 12 volts are the

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:13.820 
basically you have 12 volts are the
input<00:03:12.090> that<00:03:12.120> started<00:03:12.600> really<00:03:12.870> you<00:03:13.380> good<00:03:13.560> up<00:03:13.680> to

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:13.830 
input that started really you good up to

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:16.730 
input that started really you good up to
there<00:03:14.000> the<00:03:15.000> 12<00:03:15.720> volts<00:03:15.990> comes<00:03:16.170> in<00:03:16.290> on<00:03:16.410> that<00:03:16.560> red

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:16.740 
there the 12 volts comes in on that red

00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:18.800 
there the 12 volts comes in on that red
wire<00:03:16.950> as<00:03:17.220> I<00:03:17.340> mentioned<00:03:17.670> earlier<00:03:17.970> though<00:03:18.570> then

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:18.810 
wire as I mentioned earlier though then

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:21.170 
wire as I mentioned earlier though then
you<00:03:19.560> look<00:03:19.770> you<00:03:20.220> have<00:03:20.250> the<00:03:20.490> purple<00:03:20.880> wire<00:03:21.030> that

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:21.180 
you look you have the purple wire that

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:23.840 
you look you have the purple wire that
comes<00:03:21.330> on<00:03:21.570> the<00:03:21.660> really<00:03:21.990> and<00:03:22.230> then<00:03:22.740> goes<00:03:23.010> to<00:03:23.670> one

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:23.850 
comes on the really and then goes to one

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:25.910 
comes on the really and then goes to one
of<00:03:23.940> the<00:03:24.000> contacts<00:03:24.510> on<00:03:24.780> the<00:03:25.020> starter<00:03:25.380> motor<00:03:25.410> on

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:25.920 
of the contacts on the starter motor on

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:27.860 
of the contacts on the starter motor on
this<00:03:26.400> of<00:03:26.730> the<00:03:26.850> starter<00:03:27.180> motor<00:03:27.210> here<00:03:27.660> it's

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:27.870 
this of the starter motor here it's

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:29.960 
this of the starter motor here it's
under<00:03:28.110> the<00:03:28.230> right<00:03:28.410> and<00:03:28.650> right<00:03:29.250> wheel<00:03:29.430> well<00:03:29.670> I

will show you that towards the end of

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:33.620 
will show you that towards the end of
the<00:03:31.770> video<00:03:32.010> now<00:03:32.550> there's<00:03:32.730> two<00:03:32.880> contacts<00:03:33.420> on

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:33.630 
the video now there's two contacts on

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:35.840 
the video now there's two contacts on
there<00:03:33.780> one<00:03:33.990> is<00:03:34.230> a<00:03:34.650> 12-volt<00:03:35.190> feed<00:03:35.520> that<00:03:35.670> comes

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:35.850 
there one is a 12-volt feed that comes

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:38.000 
there one is a 12-volt feed that comes
directly<00:03:36.060> from<00:03:36.420> the<00:03:36.660> battery<00:03:36.840> okay

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:38.010 
directly from the battery okay

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:40.490 
directly from the battery okay
the<00:03:38.460> other<00:03:38.580> feed<00:03:38.910> is<00:03:39.090> the<00:03:39.300> purple<00:03:39.660> wire<00:03:39.840> which

00:03:40.490 --> 00:03:40.500 
the other feed is the purple wire which

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:43.850 
the other feed is the purple wire which
I've<00:03:40.650> called<00:03:40.860> 12<00:03:41.400> switch<00:03:41.790> 12<00:03:42.150> folks<00:03:42.420> so<00:03:43.230> when

00:03:43.850 --> 00:03:43.860 
I've called 12 switch 12 folks so when

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:46.280 
I've called 12 switch 12 folks so when
this<00:03:43.980> is<00:03:44.040> operating<00:03:44.700> successfully<00:03:45.360> basically

this is operating successfully basically

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:49.550 
this is operating successfully basically
it's<00:03:46.440> on<00:03:46.620> the<00:03:46.740> key<00:03:46.950> the<00:03:47.760> switch<00:03:48.720> 12<00:03:49.020> volts<00:03:49.350> goes

00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:49.560 
it's on the key the switch 12 volts goes

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:51.770 
it's on the key the switch 12 volts goes
to<00:03:49.740> the<00:03:49.830> solenoid<00:03:50.250> kicks<00:03:51.060> in<00:03:51.240> the<00:03:51.300> contacts

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:30.870 
and when I done the diagnosis I had

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:33.140 
and when I done the diagnosis I had
nothing<00:04:31.320> on<00:04:31.530> the<00:04:31.860> input<00:04:32.190> of<00:04:32.340> the<00:04:32.759> starter

00:04:33.140 --> 00:04:33.150 
nothing on the input of the starter

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:35.420 
nothing on the input of the starter
really<00:04:33.810> nothing<00:04:34.259> on<00:04:34.380> the<00:04:34.500> 12-volt<00:04:34.889> feed

really nothing on the 12-volt feed
so<00:04:35.910> then<00:04:36.060> what<00:04:36.240> adonis<00:04:36.690> okay<00:04:37.710> next<00:04:38.009> logical

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:38.160 
so then what adonis okay next logical

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:41.090 
so then what adonis okay next logical
step<00:04:38.660> go<00:04:39.660> to<00:04:39.720> the<00:04:39.930> neutral<00:04:40.080> safety<00:04:40.620> switch<00:04:40.860> in

00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:41.100 
step go to the neutral safety switch in

00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:20.910 
I have yet to have a starter fail on

00:05:20.910 --> 00:05:23.060 
I have yet to have a starter fail on
this<00:05:21.060> however<00:05:21.720> obviously<00:05:22.110> the<00:05:22.530> way<00:05:22.650> to<00:05:22.710> detect

00:05:23.060 --> 00:05:23.070 
this however obviously the way to detect

00:05:23.070 --> 00:05:24.650 
this however obviously the way to detect
it<00:05:23.310> would<00:05:23.430> be<00:05:23.550> if<00:05:23.669> you've<00:05:23.820> got<00:05:23.970> 12<00:05:24.240> volts<00:05:24.539> on

00:05:24.650 --> 00:05:24.660 
it would be if you've got 12 volts on

00:05:24.660 --> 00:05:27.140 
it would be if you've got 12 volts on
that<00:05:24.780> switch<00:05:25.050> 12<00:05:25.380> volts<00:05:25.740> and<00:05:25.949> you<00:05:26.789> can<00:05:26.940> freely

00:05:27.140 --> 00:05:27.150 
that switch 12 volts and you can freely

00:05:27.150 --> 00:05:29.960 
that switch 12 volts and you can freely
turn<00:05:27.479> the<00:05:27.810> crankshaft<00:05:28.259> you<00:05:29.130> got<00:05:29.280> 12<00:05:29.520> volts<00:05:29.820> on

00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:29.970 
turn the crankshaft you got 12 volts on

00:05:29.970 --> 00:05:32.210 
turn the crankshaft you got 12 volts on
the<00:05:30.030> battery<00:05:30.360> more<00:05:31.199> than<00:05:31.380> likely<00:05:31.560> your

00:05:32.210 --> 00:05:32.220 
the battery more than likely your

00:05:32.220 --> 00:05:34.370 
the battery more than likely your
starter<00:05:32.669> is<00:05:32.820> toast<00:05:33.120> obviously<00:05:34.020> if<00:05:34.080> you<00:05:34.169> hear<00:05:34.349> a

00:05:34.370 --> 00:05:34.380 
starter is toast obviously if you hear a

00:05:34.380 --> 00:05:35.570 
starter is toast obviously if you hear a
clicking<00:05:34.650> it<00:05:34.889> tells<00:05:35.099> you<00:05:35.190> the<00:05:35.280> solenoids

00:05:35.570 --> 00:05:35.580 
clicking it tells you the solenoids

00:05:35.580 --> 00:05:37.370 
clicking it tells you the solenoids
working<00:05:36.120> and<00:05:36.330> it's<00:05:36.720> probably<00:05:36.930> the<00:05:37.050> actual

00:05:37.370 --> 00:05:37.380 
working and it's probably the actual

00:05:37.380 --> 00:05:40.310 
working and it's probably the actual
motor<00:05:37.590> as<00:05:38.370> I<00:05:38.550> said<00:05:38.760> I<00:05:38.970> really<00:05:39.510> apologize<00:05:39.750> for

00:05:40.310 --> 00:05:40.320 
motor as I said I really apologize for

00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:42.649 
motor as I said I really apologize for
the<00:05:40.380> kind<00:05:40.590> of<00:05:40.680> crappy<00:05:41.190> drawings<00:05:41.610> and<00:05:41.820> but

00:05:42.649 --> 00:05:42.659 
the kind of crappy drawings and but

00:05:42.659 --> 00:05:44.750 
the kind of crappy drawings and but
hopefully<00:05:43.139> it<00:05:43.710> gives<00:05:43.919> you<00:05:44.070> an<00:05:44.190> idea<00:05:44.280> if<00:05:44.610> you're

00:05:44.750 --> 00:05:44.760 
hopefully it gives you an idea if you're

00:05:44.760 --> 00:05:46.430 
hopefully it gives you an idea if you're
working<00:05:44.970> on<00:05:45.120> this<00:05:45.270> vehicle<00:05:45.510> or<00:05:45.840> any<00:05:46.020> really

starting system and to just use and some
some<00:05:52.080> logic<00:05:52.500> you<00:05:52.650> know<00:05:52.740> don't<00:05:53.039> you<00:05:53.130> start

00:05:53.390 --> 00:05:53.400 
some logic you know don't you start

00:05:53.400 --> 00:05:54.920 
some logic you know don't you start
throwing<00:05:53.580> parts<00:05:54.090> at<00:05:54.240> this<00:05:54.360> stuff<00:05:54.599> and<00:05:54.810> hope

00:05:54.920 --> 00:05:54.930
