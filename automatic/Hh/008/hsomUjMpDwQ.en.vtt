world we already see this kind of

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:28.789 
world we already see this kind of
training<00:01:27.509> green<00:01:27.869> duct<00:01:28.020> tape<00:01:28.200> and<00:01:28.380> I<00:01:28.470> mention

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:28.799 
training green duct tape and I mention

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:31.069 
training green duct tape and I mention
about<00:01:28.920> that<00:01:29.130> the<00:01:29.340> sim<00:01:29.579> free<00:01:29.850> notice<00:01:30.630> also<00:01:30.840> you

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:31.079 
about that the sim free notice also you

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:34.940 
about that the sim free notice also you
know<00:01:31.320> I<00:01:32.250> know<00:01:32.759> it<00:01:33.000> will<00:01:33.180> take<00:01:33.390> time<00:01:33.680> okay<00:01:34.680> but<00:01:34.740> I

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
know I know it will take time okay but I

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:37.090 
know I know it will take time okay but I
think<00:01:35.250> we<00:01:35.790> would<00:01:35.939> rather<00:01:36.119> you<00:01:36.450> know<00:01:36.540> to<00:01:36.600> try<00:01:37.020> to

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:37.100 
think we would rather you know to try to

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:40.760 
think we would rather you know to try to
take<00:01:38.100> the<00:01:38.280> lead<00:01:38.490> and<00:01:38.930> directly<00:01:39.930> or<00:01:40.229> go<00:01:40.470> from

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 
take the lead and directly or go from

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:44.450 
take the lead and directly or go from
this<00:01:41.579> kind<00:01:41.820> of<00:01:41.939> you<00:01:42.000> know<00:01:42.090> and<00:01:42.720> lock<00:01:43.560> and<00:01:44.369> I

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.460 
this kind of you know and lock and I

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:47.060 
this kind of you know and lock and I
think<00:01:44.670> if<00:01:44.790> you<00:01:44.880> look<00:01:45.030> at<00:01:45.240> like<00:01:45.720> the<00:01:45.899> t-mobile<00:01:46.500> I

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:47.070 
think if you look at like the t-mobile I

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:50.600 
think if you look at like the t-mobile I
think<00:01:47.729> I<00:01:47.880> also<00:01:48.420> encouraging<00:01:49.200> this<00:01:49.320> kind<00:01:49.380> of<00:01:49.740> so

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:50.610 
think I also encouraging this kind of so

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:53.120 
think I also encouraging this kind of so
less<00:01:51.000> and<00:01:51.240> less<00:01:51.390> subjective<00:01:52.049> subtypes<00:01:52.530> this

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130 
less and less subjective subtypes this

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:55.340 
less and less subjective subtypes this
kind<00:01:53.310> of<00:01:53.369> approach<00:01:53.460> and<00:01:54.090> I<00:01:54.659> think<00:01:54.930> like<00:01:55.229> the

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:55.350 
kind of approach and I think like the

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:56.959 
kind of approach and I think like the
Google<00:01:55.530> a<00:01:55.770> google<00:01:56.219> also<00:01:56.369> try<00:01:56.640> to<00:01:56.670> have<00:01:56.850> the

00:01:56.959 --> 00:01:56.969 
Google a google also try to have the

00:01:56.969 --> 00:01:59.300 
Google a google also try to have the
Gulf<00:01:57.329> I<00:01:57.509> and<00:01:57.869> I<00:01:58.350> can<00:01:58.500> approach<00:01:58.799> a<00:01:58.979> single

00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310 
Gulf I and I can approach a single

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:01.399 
Gulf I and I can approach a single
number<00:01:59.460> you<00:01:59.729> know<00:01:59.850> and<00:02:00.030> then<00:02:00.210> yeah<00:02:00.960> so<00:02:01.259> I<00:02:01.290> think

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:01.409 
number you know and then yeah so I think

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:05.209 
number you know and then yeah so I think
how<00:02:01.740> we<00:02:01.799> do<00:02:02.070> believe<00:02:02.399> this<00:02:02.579> is<00:02:02.820> a<00:02:03.000> a<00:02:03.890> new<00:02:04.890> trend

00:02:05.209 --> 00:02:05.219 
how we do believe this is a a new trend

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:07.770 
how we do believe this is a a new trend
that<00:02:05.399> we<00:02:05.610> would<00:02:05.700> like<00:02:05.820> to<00:02:05.850> parity<00:02:06.329> jump<00:02:06.659> in

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:07.780 
that we would like to parity jump in

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:09.480 
that we would like to parity jump in
there's<00:02:08.080> a<00:02:08.200> lot<00:02:08.350> of<00:02:08.380> buzz<00:02:08.590> downstairs<00:02:09.130> there<00:02:09.459> a

00:02:09.480 --> 00:02:09.490 
there's a lot of buzz downstairs there a

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:12.900 
there's a lot of buzz downstairs there a
whole<00:02:09.759> Isis<00:02:10.569> fans<00:02:10.840> downstairs<00:02:11.640> let<00:02:12.640> them<00:02:12.790> all

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:12.910 
whole Isis fans downstairs let them all

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:16.080 
whole Isis fans downstairs let them all
in<00:02:13.120> I<00:02:13.690> think<00:02:14.230> was<00:02:14.319> me<00:02:14.470> actually<00:02:15.090> but

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:16.090 
in I think was me actually but

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:17.550 
in I think was me actually but
specifically<00:02:16.630> around<00:02:16.780> four<00:02:17.080> gigabytes<00:02:17.470> of

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:17.560 
specifically around four gigabytes of

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:20.309 
specifically around four gigabytes of
RAM<00:02:17.800> in<00:02:18.069> this<00:02:18.490> being<00:02:18.700> this<00:02:19.480> is<00:02:19.630> the<00:02:19.750> first<00:02:19.990> vice

00:02:20.309 --> 00:02:20.319 
RAM in this being this is the first vice

00:02:20.319 --> 00:02:22.770 
RAM in this being this is the first vice
yes<00:02:20.920> take<00:02:21.310> to<00:02:21.430> ship<00:02:21.490> with<00:02:21.790> that<00:02:21.819> much<00:02:22.120> right<00:02:22.510> it

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:22.780 
yes take to ship with that much right it

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:24.240 
yes take to ship with that much right it
support<00:02:23.319> are<00:02:23.380> we<00:02:23.470> hitting<00:02:23.650> diminishing

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:24.250 
support are we hitting diminishing

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:26.220 
support are we hitting diminishing
returns<00:02:24.580> there<00:02:24.880> and<00:02:25.120> it<00:02:25.209> says<00:02:25.360> do<00:02:25.900> you<00:02:25.989> need

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:26.230 
returns there and it says do you need

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:27.870 
returns there and it says do you need
that<00:02:26.260> much<00:02:26.650> rain<00:02:26.920> what<00:02:27.130> can<00:02:27.250> I<00:02:27.340> get<00:02:27.640> from

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:27.880 
that much rain what can I get from

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:29.640 
that much rain what can I get from
having<00:02:28.030> that<00:02:28.209> much<00:02:28.540> RAM<00:02:28.810> that<00:02:29.080> was<00:02:29.230> free<00:02:29.410> over

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:29.650 
having that much RAM that was free over

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:32.250 
having that much RAM that was free over
it<00:02:29.800> I<00:02:30.120> think<00:02:31.120> we<00:02:31.239> have<00:02:31.270> done<00:02:31.630> that<00:02:31.870> kind<00:02:32.050> of<00:02:32.200> you

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:32.260 
it I think we have done that kind of you

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:36.540 
it I think we have done that kind of you
know<00:02:32.380> uh<00:02:34.050> tester<00:02:35.050> right<00:02:35.260> for<00:02:35.470> example<00:02:35.860> 26<00:02:36.340> you

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:36.550 
know uh tester right for example 26 you

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:39.390 
know uh tester right for example 26 you
know<00:02:36.700> a<00:02:36.970> Brunning<00:02:37.690> there<00:02:37.900> we<00:02:38.470> do<00:02:38.709> see<00:02:39.010> no<00:02:39.220> the

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:39.400 
know a Brunning there we do see no the

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:41.220 
know a Brunning there we do see no the
performance<00:02:40.090> difference<00:02:40.450> there<00:02:40.630> because<00:02:40.959> now

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:41.230 
performance difference there because now

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:44.130 
performance difference there because now
you<00:02:41.290> know<00:02:42.000> the<00:02:43.000> thrashing<00:02:43.420> actually<00:02:44.019> it's

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:44.140 
you know the thrashing actually it's

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:46.020 
you know the thrashing actually it's
happening<00:02:44.739> and<00:02:44.890> when<00:02:45.489> the<00:02:45.610> threshing

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:46.030 
happening and when the threshing

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:49.140 
happening and when the threshing
happened<00:02:46.480> in<00:02:46.600> actually<00:02:47.050> know<00:02:47.260> is<00:02:47.519> also<00:02:48.519> the

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:49.150 
happened in actually know is also the

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:52.590 
happened in actually know is also the
battery<00:02:49.510> drain<00:02:50.280> so<00:02:51.280> I<00:02:51.310> think<00:02:51.430> no<00:02:52.060> we<00:02:52.480> are

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:52.600 
battery drain so I think no we are

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:55.470 
battery drain so I think no we are
talking<00:02:52.989> about<00:02:53.370> how<00:02:54.370> many<00:02:54.610> wars<00:02:54.940> and<00:02:55.330> then

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:55.480 
talking about how many wars and then

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:57.210 
talking about how many wars and then
what<00:02:55.660> kind<00:02:55.870> of<00:02:55.930> performance<00:02:56.260> right<00:02:56.739> so<00:02:56.980> I

00:02:57.210 --> 00:02:57.220 
what kind of performance right so I

00:02:57.220 --> 00:02:59.729 
what kind of performance right so I
think<00:02:57.790> it's<00:02:57.910> always<00:02:58.090> important<00:02:58.780> to<00:02:58.810> ya<00:02:59.440> to

00:02:59.729 --> 00:02:59.739 
think it's always important to ya to

00:02:59.739 --> 00:03:01.680 
think it's always important to ya to
think<00:03:00.010> about<00:03:00.220> that<00:03:00.459> yeah<00:03:00.819> when<00:03:01.390> you<00:03:01.450> look<00:03:01.600> at

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:01.690 
think about that yeah when you look at

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:03.930 
think about that yeah when you look at
the<00:03:01.750> big<00:03:01.900> picture<00:03:02.170> I<00:03:02.560> think<00:03:02.920> one<00:03:03.670> of<00:03:03.700> the<00:03:03.790> more

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:03.940 
the big picture I think one of the more

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:05.040 
the big picture I think one of the more
impressive<00:03:04.090> stats<00:03:04.540> that<00:03:04.660> you<00:03:04.750> talked<00:03:04.959> about

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:05.050 
impressive stats that you talked about

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:07.259 
impressive stats that you talked about
was<00:03:05.290> that<00:03:05.319> 10<00:03:05.680> million<00:03:05.890> phones<00:03:06.280> already<00:03:06.790> sold

00:03:07.259 --> 00:03:07.269 
was that 10 million phones already sold

00:03:07.269 --> 00:03:09.300 
was that 10 million phones already sold
since<00:03:07.510> last<00:03:07.780> April<00:03:08.260> yes<00:03:08.650> there's<00:03:08.890> probably<00:03:09.220> a

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:09.310 
since last April yes there's probably a

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:11.070 
since last April yes there's probably a
lot<00:03:09.580> of<00:03:09.730> people<00:03:09.850> at<00:03:10.090> North<00:03:10.330> America<00:03:10.780> to<00:03:10.930> your

00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:11.080 
lot of people at North America to your

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:13.199 
lot of people at North America to your
point<00:03:11.319> who<00:03:11.620> may<00:03:12.340> have<00:03:12.370> heard<00:03:12.820> of<00:03:12.910> his<00:03:13.030> juice

00:03:13.199 --> 00:03:13.209 
point who may have heard of his juice

00:03:13.209 --> 00:03:15.060 
point who may have heard of his juice
before<00:03:13.390> this<00:03:14.290> might<00:03:14.530> be<00:03:14.680> their<00:03:14.890> first

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:15.070 
before this might be their first

00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:17.729 
before this might be their first
introduction<00:03:15.519> to<00:03:15.730> the<00:03:15.970> brand<00:03:16.209> so<00:03:17.140> what<00:03:17.620> does

00:03:17.729 --> 00:03:17.739 
introduction to the brand so what does

00:03:17.739 --> 00:03:19.620 
introduction to the brand so what does
that<00:03:17.769> mean<00:03:18.100> for<00:03:18.130> you<00:03:18.880> as<00:03:19.030> a<00:03:19.060> company<00:03:19.510> this

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:19.630 
that mean for you as a company this

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:20.910 
that mean for you as a company this
could<00:03:19.810> be<00:03:19.930> like<00:03:20.079> your<00:03:20.260> foot<00:03:20.470> in<00:03:20.590> the<00:03:20.680> door<00:03:20.709> to

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:20.920 
could be like your foot in the door to

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:22.710 
could be like your foot in the door to
not<00:03:21.250> only<00:03:21.370> sell<00:03:21.640> more<00:03:21.790> phones<00:03:22.000> but<00:03:22.299> maybe<00:03:22.480> get

00:03:22.710 --> 00:03:22.720 
not only sell more phones but maybe get

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:24.810 
not only sell more phones but maybe get
those<00:03:22.900> people<00:03:23.200> to<00:03:23.230> buy<00:03:23.680> your<00:03:24.250> notebooks<00:03:24.670> and

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:24.820 
those people to buy your notebooks and

00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:26.310 
those people to buy your notebooks and
other<00:03:24.910> products<00:03:25.390> for<00:03:25.570> the<00:03:25.630> first<00:03:25.810> time<00:03:26.019> what

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:26.320 
other products for the first time what

00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:27.270 
other products for the first time what
do<00:03:26.380> you<00:03:26.440> think<00:03:26.590> about<00:03:26.620> that<00:03:26.799> sort<00:03:27.220> of

00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:27.280 
do you think about that sort of

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:29.819 
do you think about that sort of
opportunity<00:03:27.940> of<00:03:28.510> course<00:03:28.900> yeah<00:03:29.320> I<00:03:29.380> think

00:03:29.819 --> 00:03:29.829 
opportunity of course yeah I think

00:03:29.829 --> 00:03:33.810 
opportunity of course yeah I think
before<00:03:30.579> frankly<00:03:31.120> speaking<00:03:31.239> you<00:03:31.570> know<00:03:32.519> we<00:03:33.519> we

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:33.820 
before frankly speaking you know we we

00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:36.840 
before frankly speaking you know we we
tried<00:03:34.209> to<00:03:34.390> get<00:03:34.989> into<00:03:35.230> this<00:03:35.709> phone<00:03:36.430> market

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:36.850 
tried to get into this phone market

00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:39.030 
tried to get into this phone market

00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:55.630 
have to have the sharpest weapon okay

00:03:55.630 --> 00:03:57.240 
have to have the sharpest weapon okay
that<00:03:56.049> you<00:03:56.200> know<00:03:56.320> can<00:03:56.500> really<00:03:56.769> drive<00:03:57.160> the

00:03:57.240 --> 00:03:57.250 
that you know can really drive the

00:03:57.250 --> 00:03:59.670 
that you know can really drive the
luxury<00:03:57.850> to<00:03:58.510> the<00:03:58.660> extreme<00:03:58.989> so<00:03:59.260> I<00:03:59.290> think<00:03:59.440> that

00:03:59.670 --> 00:03:59.680 
luxury to the extreme so I think that

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:03.240 
luxury to the extreme so I think that
every<00:04:00.570> every<00:04:01.570> performance<00:04:02.410> is<00:04:02.590> one<00:04:02.890> thing<00:04:03.220> you

00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:03.250 
every every performance is one thing you

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:06.180 
every every performance is one thing you
know<00:04:03.549> and<00:04:03.790> the<00:04:04.390> camera<00:04:05.109> is<00:04:05.290> another<00:04:05.890> thing

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:06.190 
know and the camera is another thing

00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:09.420 
know and the camera is another thing
also<00:04:06.880> that<00:04:07.060> goes<00:04:07.359> Nui<00:04:07.750> yeah<00:04:08.709> everything<00:04:09.250> we

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:09.430 
also that goes Nui yeah everything we

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:11.880 
also that goes Nui yeah everything we

HDR<00:04:39.900> that<00:04:40.900> one<00:04:41.320> I<00:04:41.350> think<00:04:42.030> it's<00:04:43.030> what<00:04:43.360> we<00:04:43.510> spent

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:43.870 
HDR that one I think it's what we spent

00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:46.680 
HDR that one I think it's what we spent
a<00:04:44.080> lot<00:04:44.320> of<00:04:44.350> in<00:04:44.680> our<00:04:44.830> engineering<00:04:45.370> effort<00:04:46.030> to

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:46.690 
a lot of in our engineering effort to

00:04:46.690 --> 00:04:49.800 
a lot of in our engineering effort to
try<00:04:47.170> to<00:04:47.200> differentiate<00:04:48.100> with<00:04:48.460> our<00:04:49.210> competitor

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:49.810 
try to differentiate with our competitor

try to differentiate with our competitor
okay<00:04:50.230> the<00:04:50.920> performance<00:04:51.460> monster<00:04:51.970> I<00:04:52.150> think<00:04:52.510> I

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:52.570 
okay the performance monster I think I

00:04:52.570 --> 00:04:56.190 
okay the performance monster I think I
also<00:04:52.780> enjoyed<00:04:53.410> that<00:04:53.740> because<00:04:54.070> is<00:04:54.930> it<00:04:55.930> also

00:04:56.190 --> 00:04:56.200 
also enjoyed that because is it also

00:04:56.200 --> 00:04:58.740 
also enjoyed that because is it also
takes<00:04:56.440> a<00:04:56.590> lot<00:04:56.740> of<00:04:56.770> effort<00:04:57.220> the<00:04:57.750> breakthrough

00:04:58.740 --> 00:04:58.750 
takes a lot of effort the breakthrough

00:04:58.750 --> 00:05:00.900 
takes a lot of effort the breakthrough
is<00:04:58.930> actually<00:04:59.320> in<00:04:59.410> the<00:04:59.500> midnight<00:04:59.860> we<00:05:00.640> have<00:05:00.790> this

00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:00.910 
is actually in the midnight we have this

00:05:00.910 --> 00:05:03.420 
is actually in the midnight we have this
kind<00:05:01.120> of<00:05:01.270> in<00:05:01.420> architecture<00:05:02.140> and<00:05:02.590> she<00:05:02.800> can<00:05:03.160> help

00:05:03.420 --> 00:05:03.430 
kind of in architecture and she can help

00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:05.550 
kind of in architecture and she can help
you<00:05:03.520> know<00:05:03.640> a<00:05:03.850> bigger<00:05:04.150> kind<00:05:05.020> of<00:05:05.140> you<00:05:05.230> know<00:05:05.260> our

00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:05.560 
you know a bigger kind of you know our

00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:08.550 
you know a bigger kind of you know our
battery<00:05:06.040> and<00:05:06.280> then<00:05:06.730> also<00:05:06.940> good<00:05:07.390> for<00:05:07.600> sometimes

00:05:08.550 --> 00:05:08.560 
battery and then also good for sometimes

00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:10.560 
battery and then also good for sometimes
people<00:05:08.860> may<00:05:09.220> try<00:05:09.490> to<00:05:09.550> think<00:05:09.790> about<00:05:09.940> it<00:05:10.240> on<00:05:10.390> I

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:10.570 
people may try to think about it on I

00:05:10.570 --> 00:05:13.290 
people may try to think about it on I
everything<00:05:11.470> madam<00:05:11.890> I<00:05:12.130> think<00:05:12.820> that's<00:05:12.940> also<00:05:13.180> a

00:05:13.290 --> 00:05:13.300 
everything madam I think that's also a

00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:16.050 
everything madam I think that's also a
challenge<00:05:13.630> to<00:05:14.080> you<00:05:14.230> know<00:05:14.350> the<00:05:14.700> the<00:05:15.700> you<00:05:15.940> know

00:05:16.050 --> 00:05:16.060 
challenge to you know the the you know

00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:18.990 
challenge to you know the the you know
the<00:05:16.380> radiation<00:05:17.380> Lauren<00:05:17.890> I<00:05:18.160> have<00:05:18.580> to<00:05:18.850> our

00:05:18.990 --> 00:05:19.000 
the radiation Lauren I have to our

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:21.060 
the radiation Lauren I have to our
quotient<00:05:19.420> so<00:05:19.840> sometimes<00:05:20.110> you<00:05:20.470> always<00:05:20.860> will

00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:21.070 
quotient so sometimes you always will

00:05:21.070 --> 00:05:23.910 
quotient so sometimes you always will
see<00:05:21.250> that<00:05:21.430> you<00:05:21.730> will<00:05:21.760> have<00:05:22.510> been<00:05:22.740> driving<00:05:23.740> back

00:05:23.910 --> 00:05:23.920 
see that you will have been driving back

00:05:23.920 --> 00:05:26.220 
see that you will have been driving back
in<00:05:24.100> on<00:05:24.190> the<00:05:24.310> stock<00:05:24.550> antenna<00:05:25.000> okay<00:05:25.720> at<00:05:25.930> the<00:05:26.080> end

00:05:26.220 --> 00:05:26.230 
in on the stock antenna okay at the end

00:05:26.230 --> 00:05:29.550 
in on the stock antenna okay at the end
of<00:05:26.290> approach<00:05:27.000> but<00:05:28.000> I<00:05:28.060> think<00:05:28.390> you<00:05:29.080> will<00:05:29.320> still

00:05:29.550 --> 00:05:29.560 
of approach but I think you will still

00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:31.350 
of approach but I think you will still
see<00:05:29.590> the<00:05:29.950> difference<00:05:30.340> sometimes<00:05:30.970> you<00:05:31.120> know<00:05:31.240> in

00:05:31.350 --> 00:05:31.360 
see the difference sometimes you know in

00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:33.330 
see the difference sometimes you know in
the<00:05:31.480> toilet<00:05:31.870> you<00:05:32.500> can<00:05:32.680> still<00:05:32.950> feel<00:05:33.220> the

00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:33.340 
the toilet you can still feel the

00:05:33.340 --> 00:05:35.930 
the toilet you can still feel the
difference<00:05:33.760> right<00:05:33.880> because<00:05:34.690> yeah

00:05:35.930 --> 00:05:35.940 
difference right because yeah

00:05:35.940 --> 00:05:37.500 
difference right because yeah
fundamentally<00:05:36.940> you<00:05:37.030> know<00:05:37.120> this<00:05:37.300> kind<00:05:37.480> of

00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:37.510 
fundamentally you know this kind of

00:05:37.510 --> 00:05:40.470 
fundamentally you know this kind of
shielding<00:05:38.220> okay<00:05:39.220> even<00:05:39.610> you<00:05:39.700> try<00:05:39.910> to<00:05:39.970> use<00:05:40.300> the

00:05:40.470 --> 00:05:40.480 
shielding okay even you try to use the

00:05:40.480 --> 00:05:42.870 
shielding okay even you try to use the
start<00:05:40.960> antenna<00:05:41.410> under<00:05:41.710> an<00:05:41.980> approach<00:05:42.340> I<00:05:42.610> think

00:05:42.870 --> 00:05:42.880 
start antenna under an approach I think

00:05:42.880 --> 00:05:45.180 
start antenna under an approach I think
you<00:05:43.270> still<00:05:43.510> wear<00:05:43.720> have<00:05:43.840> when<00:05:44.740> you<00:05:44.860> do<00:05:45.040> the

00:05:45.180 --> 00:05:45.190 
you still wear have when you do the

00:05:45.190 --> 00:05:48.300 
you still wear have when you do the
comparison<00:05:46.110> this<00:05:47.110> is<00:05:47.320> physics<00:05:47.770> you<00:05:48.070> know<00:05:48.190> it's

00:05:48.300 --> 00:05:48.310 
comparison this is physics you know it's

00:05:48.310 --> 00:05:54.050 
comparison this is physics you know it's
just<00:05:48.430> the<00:05:48.550> physics<00:05:49.180> in<00:05:49.330> oh<00:05:49.420> yeah

00:05:54.050 --> 00:05:54.060 

00:05:54.060 --> 00:05:56.120
