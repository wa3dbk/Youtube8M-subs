00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:04.500
 Australian scientists have discovered gold 

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:06.509
 on the surface of eucalyptus leaves 

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:09.000
 and not find out it's microscopic 

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:13.160
 gold particles are absorbed from underground 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:16.529
 ore deposits how cool 

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:19.770
 hello live walrus news 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:22.170
 eucalyptus roots can deepen 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:24.930
 more than 40 meters away in search 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:27.599
 Water Biochemistry and Earth Science Settlement 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:29.939
 engineering resource science agency 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:32.059
 in australia found out that the trees 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:34.020
 grown for gold deposits 

00:00:32.059 --> 00:00:35.130
 concentration of gold particles on 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:37.410
 leaf surfaces 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:40.140
 was 40 times more than the trees 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:42.899
 grown on ordinary soil scientists 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:44.820
 compared the leaves of eucalyptus trees in 

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:47.430
 gold mining locations in western australia 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:50.370
 with leaves of trees located on 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:52.620
 distance of 800 meters one also they 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:55.199
 grown eucalyptus trees in greenhouses 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:57.030
 with the soil in which the gold particles were injected 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:59.160
 using regular mail 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:01.680
 it was discovered that the leaves of the trees 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:03.899
 selectively preserved microscopic 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:05.760
 gold particles whose size is on average 

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:09.330
 amounted to about eight 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:11.850
 micromedus 1 micrometer equals 1 million and 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:13.680
 meters, researchers believe that particles 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:16.470
 came from underground through root 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:18.450
 system trees gold possibly toxic 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:20.790
 for plants and moves the edges 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:22.619
 leaves or selected areas inside 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:24.570
 cells to reduce the bane 

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:26.549
 chemical reaction so if you have 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:28.740
 there is gold not burying sat near 

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:30.570
 trees it does not mean that you can now 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:32.880
 will fill the wallet then in the collector 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:35.430
 leaves average concentration of gold in 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:37.860
 the leaf was only 46 particles on 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:40.259
 billion and this is less than zero integer 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:44.490
 five million percent of their weight 

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:47.130
 each leaf however beginners gold 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:49.320
 harvesting trees qalib then 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:51.630
 suggest gold deposits 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:53.850
 especially less cool some may 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:55.079
 go unnoticed during 

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:57.420
 massive storm 

00:01:55.079 --> 00:02:00.119
 so if you grow in the yard 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:03.000
 eucalyptus trees share eucalyptus 

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:05.100
 mine detectors and start digging because 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:07.680
 maybe i repeat maybe 

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:11.450
 Well, you find anything and maybe 

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:11.450
 but on this all look further
