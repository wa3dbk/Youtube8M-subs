00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340 
one of those self-made men so to speak

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:55.100 
one of those self-made men so to speak
and<00:00:53.579> to<00:00:53.699> be<00:00:53.910> honest<00:00:54.149> with<00:00:54.210> you<00:00:54.360> even<00:00:54.390> if<00:00:54.899> he

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110 
and to be honest with you even if he

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:56.840 
and to be honest with you even if he
wasn't<00:00:55.530> really<00:00:55.980> you<00:00:56.309> know<00:00:56.399> injured<00:00:56.789> or

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
wasn't really you know injured or

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:58.220 
wasn't really you know injured or
whatever<00:00:57.059> I<00:00:57.120> guess<00:00:57.300> him<00:00:57.750> and<00:00:57.899> Lee<00:00:57.989> had<00:00:58.199> a

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
whatever I guess him and Lee had a

00:00:58.230 --> 00:00:59.569 
whatever I guess him and Lee had a
handicap<00:00:58.620> at<00:00:58.949> the<00:00:59.039> end<00:00:59.129> of<00:00:59.190> the<00:00:59.250> day<00:00:59.309> because

00:00:59.569 --> 00:00:59.579 
handicap at the end of the day because

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:01.430 
handicap at the end of the day because
Lee<00:01:00.000> it<00:01:00.300> was<00:01:00.420> you<00:01:00.570> know<00:01:00.660> he<00:01:00.780> was<00:01:00.809> punctured<00:01:01.350> or

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
Lee it was you know he was punctured or

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:03.260 
Lee it was you know he was punctured or
whatever<00:01:01.710> and<00:01:01.920> sure<00:01:02.460> I<00:01:02.520> had<00:01:02.820> like<00:01:03.000> you<00:01:03.030> know<00:01:03.239> a

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:03.270 
whatever and sure I had like you know a

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:05.179 
whatever and sure I had like you know a
hole<00:01:03.750> in<00:01:03.930> his<00:01:04.019> chest<00:01:04.049> or<00:01:04.290> whatever<00:01:04.530> so<00:01:04.710> I<00:01:04.890> guess

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:05.189 
hole in his chest or whatever so I guess

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:07.429 
hole in his chest or whatever so I guess
it<00:01:05.369> kind<00:01:05.549> of<00:01:05.640> evened<00:01:06.090> out<00:01:06.180> and<00:01:06.450> in<00:01:06.720> a<00:01:07.020> weird<00:01:07.350> way

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:07.439 
it kind of evened out and in a weird way

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:08.899 
it kind of evened out and in a weird way
or<00:01:07.680> whatever<00:01:07.860> but<00:01:08.070> I<00:01:08.250> honestly<00:01:08.670> think<00:01:08.820> that

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909 
or whatever but I honestly think that

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:10.580 
or whatever but I honestly think that
Lee<00:01:09.270> woulda<00:01:09.479> kicked<00:01:09.659> his<00:01:09.780> ass<00:01:09.869> because<00:01:10.110> Lee

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
Lee woulda kicked his ass because Lee

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:12.109 
Lee woulda kicked his ass because Lee
wasn't<00:01:10.799> even<00:01:11.070> tired<00:01:11.280> or<00:01:11.490> anything<00:01:11.670> and<00:01:11.970> he

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 
wasn't even tired or anything and he

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:13.969 
wasn't even tired or anything and he
already<00:01:12.540> had<00:01:12.750> sure<00:01:13.020> on<00:01:13.170> the<00:01:13.320> ground<00:01:13.560> and<00:01:13.770> I

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 
already had sure on the ground and I

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:15.920 
already had sure on the ground and I
mean<00:01:14.430> they<00:01:14.700> had<00:01:14.850> a<00:01:14.880> little<00:01:15.180> tussle<00:01:15.479> whatever

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930 
mean they had a little tussle whatever

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:17.690 
mean they had a little tussle whatever
they<00:01:16.049> had<00:01:16.170> a<00:01:16.200> decent<00:01:16.560> little<00:01:16.650> scuffle<00:01:17.369> whatnot

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
they had a decent little scuffle whatnot

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:19.700 
they had a decent little scuffle whatnot
but<00:01:17.909> I<00:01:18.210> honestly<00:01:18.600> think<00:01:18.750> that<00:01:18.840> just<00:01:19.140> Lee<00:01:19.320> was

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
but I honestly think that just Lee was

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:21.530 
but I honestly think that just Lee was
superior<00:01:20.070> and<00:01:20.340> every<00:01:20.490> which<00:01:20.640> way<00:01:20.670> and<00:01:20.850> I<00:01:21.180> think

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540 
superior and every which way and I think

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:23.060 
superior and every which way and I think
that<00:01:21.659> the<00:01:21.810> way<00:01:21.900> they<00:01:22.049> incorporated<00:01:22.770> guys

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
that the way they incorporated guys

as the pacing goes if you think about it

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:31.370 
as the pacing goes if you think about it
we<00:01:30.030> spent<00:01:30.240> the<00:01:30.299> entire<00:01:30.329> episode<00:01:31.020> for<00:01:31.170> the<00:01:31.229> most

say that and it provided a little piece

00:01:56.969 --> 00:01:58.730

was kind of like for nothing because

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:01.580 
was kind of like for nothing because
they<00:02:00.570> didn't<00:02:00.780> really<00:02:00.899> get<00:02:01.049> the<00:02:01.110> scroll<00:02:01.439> that

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:03.360 
they needed but ultimately it was still

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:05.120 
they needed but ultimately it was still
a<00:02:03.390> cool<00:02:03.600> little<00:02:03.780> fight<00:02:04.079> and<00:02:04.320> it<00:02:04.590> pushed<00:02:04.979> things

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:05.130 
a cool little fight and it pushed things

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:07.039

future<00:02:47.910> stuff<00:02:48.120> and<00:02:48.300> honestly<00:02:48.630> it<00:02:48.930> looks<00:02:49.140> as

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:49.290 
future stuff and honestly it looks as

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:51.200 
future stuff and honestly it looks as
though<00:02:49.320> if<00:02:49.650> we<00:02:49.980> can<00:02:50.130> at<00:02:50.250> least<00:02:50.400> have<00:02:50.640> like<00:02:50.850> cool

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:51.210 
though if we can at least have like cool

00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:52.730 
though if we can at least have like cool
little<00:02:51.450> fights<00:02:51.780> like<00:02:52.230> what<00:02:52.350> we<00:02:52.470> have<00:02:52.620> with

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:52.740 
little fights like what we have with

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:54.080 
little fights like what we have with
this<00:02:52.890> leave<00:02:53.130> one<00:02:53.340> cuz<00:02:53.670> it<00:02:53.760> looks<00:02:53.790> like<00:02:54.000> we're

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:54.090 
this leave one cuz it looks like we're

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:55.640 
this leave one cuz it looks like we're
gonna<00:02:54.180> keep<00:02:54.360> on<00:02:54.540> focusing<00:02:54.720> and<00:02:55.140> then<00:02:55.230> probably

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:55.650 
gonna keep on focusing and then probably

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:57.620 
gonna keep on focusing and then probably
after<00:02:56.040> the<00:02:56.280> Kiba<00:02:56.610> episode<00:02:57.030> then<00:02:57.360> we'll<00:02:57.480> have

00:02:57.620 --> 00:02:57.630 
after the Kiba episode then we'll have

00:02:57.630 --> 00:03:00.020 
after the Kiba episode then we'll have
Sakura<00:02:58.110> and<00:02:58.380> Ino<00:02:58.560> and<00:02:59.040> you<00:02:59.490> know<00:02:59.580> Choji

whatever and we'll keep on going like

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:04.130

that<00:03:02.280> while<00:03:02.880> still<00:03:03.150> in<00:03:03.330> the<00:03:03.630> background

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:04.140 
that while still in the background

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:05.810 
that while still in the background
pushing<00:03:04.590> forward<00:03:04.890> the<00:03:04.920> major<00:03:05.400> thing<00:03:05.580> of<00:03:05.700> like

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:05.820 
pushing forward the major thing of like

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:07.550 
pushing forward the major thing of like
Gaara<00:03:06.090> trying<00:03:06.630> to<00:03:06.690> make<00:03:06.840> sure<00:03:06.870> these<00:03:07.110> exams

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:07.560 
Gaara trying to make sure these exams

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:09.500 
Gaara trying to make sure these exams
are<00:03:07.740> a<00:03:07.770> success<00:03:08.220> so<00:03:08.430> I'd<00:03:08.820> imagine<00:03:09.210> that<00:03:09.240> that's

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:09.510 
are a success so I'd imagine that that's

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:11.030 
are a success so I'd imagine that that's
how<00:03:09.630> it's<00:03:09.750> gonna<00:03:09.810> go<00:03:10.080> and<00:03:10.260> fortunately<00:03:10.950> is

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:11.040 
how it's gonna go and fortunately is

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:12.680 
how it's gonna go and fortunately is
gonna<00:03:11.160> be<00:03:11.280> par<00:03:11.460> for<00:03:11.490> the<00:03:11.640> course<00:03:11.850> until<00:03:12.270> we<00:03:12.480> get

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:12.690 
gonna be par for the course until we get

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:14.420 
gonna be par for the course until we get
through<00:03:12.900> with<00:03:13.020> this<00:03:13.140> because<00:03:13.410> I<00:03:13.440> honestly<00:03:13.980> as

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:14.430 
through with this because I honestly as

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:16.430 
through with this because I honestly as
cool<00:03:14.820> as<00:03:15.030> this<00:03:15.240> fight<00:03:15.480> was<00:03:15.720> and<00:03:15.930> as<00:03:16.020> cool<00:03:16.230> as

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:16.440 
cool as this fight was and as cool as

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:19.430 
cool as this fight was and as cool as
this<00:03:16.590> episode<00:03:16.770> was<00:03:17.220> this<00:03:18.120> filler<00:03:18.420> the<00:03:18.930> pacing

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:19.440 
this episode was this filler the pacing

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:21.560 
this episode was this filler the pacing
really<00:03:19.830> even<00:03:20.160> with<00:03:20.880> what<00:03:21.060> we<00:03:21.180> did<00:03:21.360> in<00:03:21.480> this

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:21.570 
really even with what we did in this

00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:23.390 
really even with what we did in this
episode<00:03:21.990> it<00:03:22.110> still<00:03:22.290> feels<00:03:22.530> like<00:03:22.710> we<00:03:23.070> could<00:03:23.220> go

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:23.400 
episode it still feels like we could go

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:24.530 
episode it still feels like we could go
a<00:03:23.430> little<00:03:23.640> bit<00:03:23.820> faster<00:03:24.210> we<00:03:24.300> could<00:03:24.420> have

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:24.540 
a little bit faster we could have

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:26.090 
a little bit faster we could have
finished<00:03:24.930> that<00:03:25.140> fight<00:03:25.320> a<00:03:25.380> little<00:03:25.530> bit<00:03:25.740> sooner

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:26.100 
finished that fight a little bit sooner

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:28.010 
finished that fight a little bit sooner
and<00:03:26.280> already<00:03:26.940> started<00:03:27.090> the<00:03:27.390> key<00:03:27.540> legit<00:03:27.840> so<00:03:27.930> we

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:28.020 
and already started the key legit so we

00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:30.100 
and already started the key legit so we
could<00:03:28.170> get<00:03:28.230> that<00:03:28.380> out<00:03:28.440> the<00:03:28.680> way<00:03:28.770> too<00:03:28.830> cuz<00:03:29.220> yeah

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:30.110 
could get that out the way too cuz yeah

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:33.140 
could get that out the way too cuz yeah
it's<00:03:31.110> good<00:03:31.380> but<00:03:31.680> it's<00:03:32.040> nothing<00:03:32.730> that<00:03:32.760> you<00:03:33.030> know

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:33.150 
it's good but it's nothing that you know

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:34.910 
it's good but it's nothing that you know
we<00:03:33.300> really<00:03:33.570> are<00:03:33.720> desperate<00:03:34.200> to<00:03:34.290> see<00:03:34.470> we<00:03:34.650> want

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:34.920 
we really are desperate to see we want

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:37.010 
we really are desperate to see we want
to<00:03:35.010> get<00:03:35.190> I<00:03:35.340> think<00:03:35.460> majority<00:03:36.210> of<00:03:36.300> us<00:03:36.420> want<00:03:36.990> to

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:37.020 
to get I think majority of us want to

00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:38.450 
to get I think majority of us want to
get<00:03:37.140> back<00:03:37.320> to<00:03:37.470> moderate<00:03:37.920> and<00:03:38.070> also<00:03:38.310> far

00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:38.460 
get back to moderate and also far

00:03:38.460 --> 00:03:40.160 
get back to moderate and also far
getting<00:03:38.760> the<00:03:38.850> revelation<00:03:39.060> about<00:03:39.390> fool<00:03:39.810> I'm

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:40.170 
getting the revelation about fool I'm

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:41.720 
getting the revelation about fool I'm
pretty<00:03:40.440> sure<00:03:40.650> what<00:03:40.830> he<00:03:40.890> realizes<00:03:41.250> that<00:03:41.430> she's

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:41.730 
pretty sure what he realizes that she's

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:42.500 
pretty sure what he realizes that she's
a<00:03:41.760> jinchuriki

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:42.510 
a jinchuriki

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:44.360 
a jinchuriki
although<00:03:43.020> fool<00:03:43.350> looks<00:03:43.800> like<00:03:43.920> a<00:03:43.950> decent<00:03:44.190> person

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:44.370 
although fool looks like a decent person

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:46.400 
although fool looks like a decent person
and<00:03:44.760> nothing<00:03:45.150> like<00:03:45.270> what<00:03:45.570> Gaara<00:03:45.840> was<00:03:45.960> or

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:46.410 
and nothing like what Gaara was or

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:47.930 
and nothing like what Gaara was or
gnarled<00:03:47.010> so<00:03:47.100> when<00:03:47.190> he<00:03:47.250> gets<00:03:47.430> angry<00:03:47.610> so<00:03:47.850> I'd

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:47.940 
gnarled so when he gets angry so I'd

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:49.850 
gnarled so when he gets angry so I'd
imagine<00:03:48.030> if<00:03:48.450> food<00:03:48.840> does<00:03:49.080> release<00:03:49.560> or<00:03:49.770> whatever

00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:49.860 
imagine if food does release or whatever

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:52.460 
imagine if food does release or whatever
her<00:03:50.190> Bijou<00:03:50.700> she'll<00:03:51.270> probably<00:03:51.690> be<00:03:52.140> able<00:03:52.260> to

00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:52.470 
her Bijou she'll probably be able to

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:54.320 
her Bijou she'll probably be able to
contain<00:03:52.920> herself<00:03:53.160> and<00:03:53.550> not<00:03:53.670> really<00:03:54.180> go

00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:54.330 
contain herself and not really go

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:56.990 
contain herself and not really go
absolutely<00:03:54.810> ape<00:03:55.080> shit<00:03:55.380> so<00:03:55.560> I<00:03:55.770> think<00:03:55.950> Gaara<00:03:56.370> he

00:03:56.990 --> 00:03:57.000 
absolutely ape shit so I think Gaara he

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:58.760 
absolutely ape shit so I think Gaara he
has<00:03:57.180> a<00:03:57.210> preconceived<00:03:57.600> notion<00:03:58.050> that<00:03:58.440> she's<00:03:58.740> a

00:03:58.760 --> 00:03:58.770 
has a preconceived notion that she's a

00:03:58.770 --> 00:04:00.440 
has a preconceived notion that she's a
jinchuriki<00:03:59.040> this<00:03:59.550> is<00:03:59.700> a<00:03:59.730> scary<00:03:59.970> thing<00:04:00.210> but

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:00.450 
jinchuriki this is a scary thing but

00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:02.240 
jinchuriki this is a scary thing but
food<00:04:00.990> looks<00:04:01.200> like<00:04:01.320> a<00:04:01.350> happy<00:04:01.680> person<00:04:01.830> well<00:04:02.100> then

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:02.250 
food looks like a happy person well then

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:04.070 
food looks like a happy person well then
again<00:04:02.430> we<00:04:02.580> don't<00:04:02.700> know<00:04:02.880> that<00:04:03.420> that<00:04:03.690> much<00:04:03.870> about

00:04:04.070 --> 00:04:04.080 
again we don't know that that much about

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:05.690 
again we don't know that that much about
food<00:04:04.320> so<00:04:04.470> who<00:04:04.590> the<00:04:04.680> hell<00:04:04.830> knows<00:04:04.980> but<00:04:05.220> as<00:04:05.400> an

00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:05.700 
food so who the hell knows but as an

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:07.460 
food so who the hell knows but as an
episode<00:04:05.940> overall<00:04:06.420> I'd<00:04:06.750> say<00:04:06.810> it's<00:04:07.080> about<00:04:07.140> seven

00:04:07.460 --> 00:04:07.470 
episode overall I'd say it's about seven

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:09.230 
episode overall I'd say it's about seven
and<00:04:07.560> a<00:04:07.590> half<00:04:07.620> maybe<00:04:08.340> if<00:04:08.670> you<00:04:08.790> want<00:04:08.970> to<00:04:09.030> stretch

00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:09.240 
and a half maybe if you want to stretch

think about that Lee vs. Shira even if

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:22.880 
think about that Lee vs. Shira even if
there<00:04:21.090> were<00:04:21.180> 100<00:04:21.570> percent<00:04:21.660> both<00:04:22.080> at<00:04:22.290> their<00:04:22.620> max

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:25.650
