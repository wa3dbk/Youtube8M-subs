 Take a closer look at the Bible 

00:00:15.949 --> 00:00:19.499

 who disobey his father and his mother 

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:32.240
 In such a case, the Bible challenges the parents to the son before a court 

00:00:32.239 --> 00:00:33.520
 put 

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:36.780

 in the Bible, among other things, the place of killing the Hagen disobedience son 

00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:56.560
 the trophies are 

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:58.570
 and nothing else 

00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:01.570
 The nieces will be appreciated for their content 

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:04.690
 that's what they are 

00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:08.890
 not only for the execution of the disobedience of the Son, the Bible is invoked 

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:12.040
 God also wanted inbreeding is the speech 

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:15.130
 the first book of Moses tells of the daughters Lodz 

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:17.560

 Insurance then the pension for the elderly 

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:48.460
 how extremely misogynistic the Old Testament is 

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:51.460
 shows a biblical passage in the book of Judges 

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:57.030
 Vivid, a man of God, was visiting a landlord in a strange city 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:00.650
 as violent men knock on the door of the inn

 They want to beat up Liquid and ask for it on the man 

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:06.340
 issue 

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:09.409
 he is denied the publication of the man 

00:02:09.409 --> 00:02:12.659
 instead, he offers the men his daughter 

00:02:12.659 --> 00:02:15.659
 or how Dietz lives women 

00:02:18.689 --> 00:02:19.539
 the pack 

00:02:19.539 --> 00:02:21.719
 potatoes 

00:02:21.719 --> 00:02:23.979
 he takes the initiative 

00:02:23.979 --> 00:02:26.859
 he sends his own wife 

00:02:26.859 --> 00:02:29.859
 because know that the men embodies them 

00:02:32.059 --> 00:02:35.059
 the men are getting over the woman instantly 

00:02:36.749 --> 00:02:40.109
 At dawn, Levit finds his wife dead and presents 

00:02:40.789 --> 00:02:43.880
 with twelve women and children was then acted 

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:46.549
 and in this context Günther Schorn me too 

00:02:46.549 --> 00:02:49.539
 Probably this coating is still others that exist 

00:02:49.539 --> 00:02:52.819
 Women are then given as 

00:02:52.819 --> 00:02:54.249
 object 

00:02:54.249 --> 00:02:56.419
 Object of desire for others 

00:02:56.419 --> 00:02:58.379

00:02:58.379 --> 00:03:00.069

 over a hundred scriptures are explicitly killed in the name of God 

00:03:04.829 --> 00:03:07.829
 Jörg field offices kills this god himself 

00:03:09.019 --> 00:03:12.019
 The books of Moses even become genocide of God 

00:03:13.399 --> 00:03:17.609
 In the Mateos Gospel of the New Testament, Jesus does not just bring one 

00:03:17.609 --> 00:03:20.609
 happy message but as he proclaims himself 

00:03:22.339 --> 00:03:23.589
 genocide 

00:03:23.589 --> 00:03:26.929
 comes in the first books Aviva where it comes 

00:03:27.759 --> 00:03:32.099
 To make the promised land of Canary Islands free to the experienced people 

00:03:32.649 --> 00:03:37.189
 In the New Testament, the genocide comes before the last book of the Bible where then 

00:03:38.589 --> 00:03:41.589
 the angel in the blood is wading 

00:03:42.569 --> 00:03:45.959
 God's opponents are slaughtered 

00:03:45.959 --> 00:03:47.499
 the message of the Bible 

00:03:47.499 --> 00:03:49.939
 until the part no longer timely 

00:03:49.939 --> 00:03:53.869
 Nevertheless, there are fanatical Christians who still question the book 

00:03:53.869 --> 00:03:56.869
 and consider it as the true word of God 

00:04:05.089 --> 00:04:09.629
 Berlin in the summer of 2005, it was partly cloudy at the Brandenburg Gate had 

00:04:09.629 --> 00:04:12.659
 over ten thousand young people gathered to an ecstatic 

00:04:12.659 --> 00:04:16.019
 Masses from 8 pm Dr Reval this event neighbors 

00:04:17.789 --> 00:04:22.970
 The Christian revival movement called Wilcock Profession has called for this 

00:04:22.969 --> 00:04:23.759
 the 

00:04:23.759 --> 00:04:24.939
 the judges in Lausanne 

00:04:24.939 --> 00:04:28.219
 The so-called evangelicals have their origins in the USA 

00:04:28.789 --> 00:04:32.259
 where the group goes by the name of the costs and gains 

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:38.070
 They fight against homosexuality and abortion and above all else 

00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:39.680
 young people 

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:43.779
 the leaders Neuchâtel compared to the resignation with the Hitler 

00:04:45.069 --> 00:04:46.819
 May 

00:04:46.819 --> 00:04:50.050
 al-duri wild spots 

00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:53.610
 I think Hitler had a voice for the young people of the world 

00:04:54.749 --> 00:04:58.309
 but he was a broken man and she has the wrong place Moritz 

00:04:59.879 --> 00:05:01.349
 Albert II 

00:05:01.349 --> 00:05:04.349
 I believe God has a destiny for Germany 

00:05:05.129 --> 00:05:09.030
 the destiny is dead to collect the youth of the world and to Jesus 

00:05:09.029 --> 00:05:11.849
 To lead Christ 

00:05:11.849 --> 00:05:13.729
 that brings 

00:05:13.729 --> 00:05:16.339
 January «Should I therefore close ideas in Germany 

00:05:16.339 --> 00:05:18.379
 more and more young people 

00:05:18.379 --> 00:05:22.500
 the revival movement is growing the fundamental Christians take it with the 

00:05:22.499 --> 00:05:27.209
 life-instructions in the Bible very carefully guides the more than 2500 

00:05:27.209 --> 00:05:29.219
 Are years old 

00:05:29.219 --> 00:05:32.479
 June with a strictly regulated way of life borders the 

00:05:32.479 --> 00:05:34.610
 Consciously approaching fundamentalists 

00:05:34.610 --> 00:05:36.629
 also from other Christians 

00:05:36.629 --> 00:05:40.669
 now that would have us in Switzerland it is very easy on the 

00:05:40.669 --> 00:05:44.940
 Footwear very accurate so not even Friday when I am with one 

00:05:44.939 --> 00:05:48.489
 short excerpt of a really all book or transparent clothes 

00:05:49.639 --> 00:05:52.419
 because we are more suited to it 

00:05:52.419 --> 00:05:55.930
 and I believe that we women simply have a responsibility to them men 

00:05:55.930 --> 00:05:58.809
 Trader men are really visually influenced 

00:05:58.809 --> 00:06:01.529
 and she wants that already so hard anyway 

00:06:01.529 --> 00:06:04.949
 Run through the streets bottlenecks long ago everywhere half-naked women 

00:06:04.949 --> 00:06:08.119
 and the Bible says but 

00:06:08.119 --> 00:06:12.719
 he had that Erdloch is a man of honor only a woman in Estern 

00:06:12.719 --> 00:06:14.599
 looks at 

00:06:14.599 --> 00:06:17.240
 and the moment I dress like that or show up after that 

00:06:17.240 --> 00:06:20.409
 provocative Zubewege I would have another man to adultery 

00:06:21.449 --> 00:06:24.770
 and I can just set limits and say no samsung 

00:06:25.979 --> 00:06:28.889
 not only could she demarcate she wants to do more 

00:06:28.889 --> 00:06:33.030
 20 to 30 percent of americans are already fundamental 

00:06:33.030 --> 00:06:34.809
 to Christian communities 

00:06:34.809 --> 00:06:38.150
 and they mean to know what is good and what is evil 

00:06:38.150 --> 00:06:40.820
 the destruction of the city of New Orleans by a hack n 

00:06:40.820 --> 00:06:43.820
 consider it a just punishment of God 

00:06:46.689 --> 00:06:50.729
 Laxey save Ramos decide you should claim for her 

00:06:50.729 --> 00:06:55.759
 God's punishment, but what I can say with all my heart that you give us many 

00:06:55.759 --> 00:06:58.289
 Things happened the DGAP is not pleased 

00:06:58.289 --> 00:07:02.149
 There is not pleased that in Moulins more children are aborted than in 

00:07:02.149 --> 00:07:05.839
 Many other cities I call them have a very high crime rate 

00:07:05.839 --> 00:07:09.919
 down there people are poor because they are treated unfairly so 

00:07:09.919 --> 00:07:12.889
 besides, it manages to indulge in sexual debauchery 

00:07:12.889 --> 00:07:16.900
 there can not just look away would be kitschy but a 

00:07:16.900 --> 00:07:20.419
 Age gangster- these fundamentalists come with the modern 

00:07:20.419 --> 00:07:22.770
 not Rolf Hollander 

00:07:22.770 --> 00:07:25.479
 they do not come to terms with democracy they come with the 

00:07:25.479 --> 00:07:29.410
 Human rights also not all but life despite in this society that 

00:07:29.410 --> 00:07:32.999
 has to do with the fact that it is probably possible 

00:07:32.999 --> 00:07:37.210
 Niebel and democracy as confused by modern society 

00:07:40.360 --> 00:07:42.839
 the extreme contrasts 

00:07:42.839 --> 00:07:46.400
 she preached the charity front also called for genocide 

00:07:49.139 --> 00:07:52.190
 Fundamentalists exist in almost all religions 

00:07:53.159 --> 00:07:57.490
 unthinkable when radical Christians once bible in all passages 

00:07:57.489 --> 00:07:59.240
 take literally 

00:07:59.240 --> 00:08:02.590
 and although Islam is currently in bad light due to the extremists 

00:08:02.590 --> 00:08:03.830
 there it is 

00:08:03.830 --> 00:08:04.779

 in Germany alone, over 4,000 people commented on Islam in 2005 

00:08:09.690 --> 00:08:10.499
 four times more 

00:08:10.499 --> 00:08:11.079
 than in the year
