00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:13.950
 when when you clean your face or a 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:15.780
 once a week each depends on how 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:18.900
 have the skin because it does more or it does 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:21.480
 unless you know that it is now fashionable that 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:23.790
 have come out with some brushes that are 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:26.130
 good electric that go with batteries not 

00:00:23.790 --> 00:00:28.040
 that the application is shit for 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:31.230
 remove all the dead cells from the 

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:33.420
 of the skin not especially in some 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:35.910
 areas that are the ones that are most 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:38.610
 dirty and more accumulates and the cells 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:41.520
 dead as well I tell you one thing 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:44.610
 those brushes are going very well but there is a 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:47.810
 much easier much cheaper system 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:47.810
 what to choose 

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:56.030
 a brush of which you put the 

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:59.420
 blusher or powder or whatever I 

00:00:56.030 --> 00:01:04.100
 you also buy a brush 

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:07.130
 infant teeth that is very soft 

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:10.250

 Irritated skin or very sensitive monitor 

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:21.800
 then do it only with the brush that 

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:24.720
 it's very soft where you have the 

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:26.700
 harder and stronger skin 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:29.540
 you can use the toothbrush 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:33.780
 which is very soft because it is baby 

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:35.530
 two teeth you give for these areas as well 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:38.650
