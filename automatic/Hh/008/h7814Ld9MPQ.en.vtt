00:00:03.390 --> 00:00:08.040
 good to everyone in today's video I'm going 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:10.019
 to explain how to make the death point of 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:12.390
 back dead center back is 

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:14.820
 does like crawling a stroke would be 

00:00:12.390 --> 00:00:17.130
 another stroke only that face up instead 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:18.539
 upside down and also if in the first 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:21.060
 class the first the first video of the 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:22.769
 second season we said that the point 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:24.269
 dead cross was made keeping 

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:27.119
 always the top dead center with the 

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:29.099
 arms up in the back plus 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:31.240
 that we can do it up also what 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:33.460
 we can do below 

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:35.380
 I also said in the first class that the 

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:37.960
 There are coral neutral monitors 

00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:40.120
 they send it with the arms down that I 

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:42.100
 I was going to explain later we conditioned the 

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:44.100
 technique exercises called an arm 

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:46.930
 in arm the explanation is very simple 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:48.550
 if I'm making a deadlock with 

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:50.590
 an arm and I have to wait until 

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:52.780
 I have a full stroke until 

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:54.519
 get your arm back here while 

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:56.500
 I am recovering that it is the first phase 

00:00:54.519 --> 00:00:58.239
 of the movement I have the submerged head 

00:00:56.500 --> 00:01:00.100
 inside the water 

00:00:58.239 --> 00:01:02.080
 or I would have to propel very fast 

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:04.449
 with my feet because if not where to go 

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:05.830
 or until I have to wait until 

00:01:04.449 --> 00:01:08.880
 that the arm reaches here to be able 

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:08.880
 take off your head to lie 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:16.640
 Yes Yes 

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:24.110
 on back for example does not happen because 

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:25.580
 because as I'm face up with though 

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:27.650
 have your arms down while still 

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:31.220
 an arm stroke most of my body 

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:32.810
 the tracks are almost completely submerged 

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:34.670
 respiratory I even have the head 

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:36.650
 floating in the water and it allows me 

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:38.540
 I can get my arm out and that gives me time 

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:39.800
 and if not overwhelm me to breathe while 

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:40.940
 I give a hug 

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:44.030
 then ultimately the stalemate 

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:46.400
 would give a stroke and always get to 

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:48.410
 a neutral or point phase of 

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:50.869
 encounter of the two arms a stroke 

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:52.280
 another sentence of course also what 

00:01:50.869 --> 00:01:55.369
 let's do at a more advanced level 

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:56.930
 as would be the official deadlock by 

00:01:55.369 --> 00:01:59.180
 the arms forward as we would in 

00:01:56.930 --> 00:02:01.220
 crawling and always tending to that position 

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:04.240
 of minimum resistance that we have to 

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:04.240
 search with all styles 

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:10.849
 and that is very usual cold being able 

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:10.849
 frozen 

00:02:11.629 --> 00:02:14.629
 or 

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:22.180
 good except that's not 

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:35.220
 well then to start the deadlock 

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:37.680
 back we will do with the table 

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:39.390
 let's grab with the board doing the 

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:41.970
 from the base of the table the arms that 

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:44.490
 they are stretched but you have not thrown this way 

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:46.860
 but relaxed stretches that remain in 

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:48.870
 the table on top of the thighs as 

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:51.120
 when we did back legs and 

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:53.380
 making sure that the knees do not 

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:55.510
 flip over the table 

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:58.780
 taking care of the kicks always keeping 

00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:59.860
 a relaxation of the shoulders of inn 

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:01.720
 above the water is not exactly 

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:03.970
 above the knee is the surface 

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:05.140
 of the water and I'm kicking while 

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:07.330
 I'm giving kicks that would be a 

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:11.260
 quicker, start a new 

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:14.710
 arm stroke make me point another 

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:16.420
 arm stroke in neutral another advantage that 

00:03:14.710 --> 00:03:18.430
 has the deadlock with the table 

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:20.260
 down is that I have my shoulders free and 

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:22.240
 every time I give a stroke I can 

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:24.040
 give a good shoulder and doing 

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:25.600
 well the role gone arm thing not 

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:28.420
 could do 

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:31.080
 when that achieves here so much in point 

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:31.080
 dead back 

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:34.450
 however when we do the 

00:03:32.710 --> 00:03:36.340
 one arm one arm exercises with three 

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:38.410
 back control death points and 

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:40.990
 You will see how we work at the same time 

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:42.880
 time that own sound style 

00:03:40.990 --> 00:03:43.960
 asymmetric in principle you have to be able 

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:46.600
 do 

00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:49.690
 and as straight as possible swimming with a 

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:52.590
 arm followed by another arm but without 

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:52.590
 go to the sides 

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:59.349
 the back cover 

00:03:56.170 --> 00:04:02.210
 hugged other accounts potatoes we believe 

00:03:59.349 --> 00:04:04.640
 something a little more when I already master 

00:04:02.210 --> 00:04:08.050
 with the table actually do not 

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:08.050
 the table is exactly the same 

00:04:10.710 --> 00:04:16.030
 the other arm stroke I kick 

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:19.090
 consider necessary to stabilize 

00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:21.670
 Many disposition for one side per se 

00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:23.650
 I got a little water lent 

00:04:21.670 --> 00:04:25.780
 attention and concentrating on aspects 

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:28.240
 analytics has pressed global vale already 

00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:30.550
 there will be other exercises like the cambrils 

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:33.010
 for example in which we will work the 

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:36.249
 lack of grenade and the frequency for 

00:04:33.010 --> 00:04:38.919
 that is always a constant traction 

00:04:36.249 --> 00:04:41.289
 I'm already noticing going to a stop 

00:04:38.919 --> 00:04:44.939
 side and giving him the kicks he makes us 

00:04:41.289 --> 00:04:44.939
 the knee and pulling out of the shoulders
