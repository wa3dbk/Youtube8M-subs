more<00:00:41.809> than<00:00:42.289> just<00:00:42.320> single<00:00:43.070> player<00:00:43.280> there's

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:44.030 
more than just single player there's

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:46.989 
more than just single player there's
also<00:00:44.210> a<00:00:44.390> co-op<00:00:45.019> aspect<00:00:45.530> as<00:00:45.649> well<00:00:45.679> not<00:00:46.489> too<00:00:46.760> long

00:00:46.989 --> 00:00:46.999 
also a co-op aspect as well not too long

00:00:46.999 --> 00:00:49.450 
also a co-op aspect as well not too long
but<00:00:47.329> it's<00:00:47.890> enough<00:00:48.890> to<00:00:49.100> keep<00:00:49.129> you<00:00:49.370> entertained

00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:49.460 
but it's enough to keep you entertained

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:53.770 
but it's enough to keep you entertained
and<00:00:50.920> people<00:00:51.920> would<00:00:52.010> ask<00:00:52.129> me<00:00:52.249> you<00:00:52.730> know<00:00:52.780> you

00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:53.780 
and people would ask me you know you

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:55.119 
and people would ask me you know you
think<00:00:54.019> you<00:00:54.109> Dan<00:00:54.440> would<00:00:54.589> have<00:00:54.679> started<00:00:54.859> on<00:00:55.039> it

00:00:55.119 --> 00:00:55.129 
think you Dan would have started on it

00:00:55.129 --> 00:00:56.110 
think you Dan would have started on it
by<00:00:55.219> now<00:00:55.370> because<00:00:55.579> it's<00:00:55.699> been<00:00:55.789> a<00:00:55.850> few<00:00:56.059> days

00:00:56.110 --> 00:00:56.120 
by now because it's been a few days

00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:58.840 
by now because it's been a few days
where<00:00:56.420> I<00:00:56.449> haven't<00:00:57.429> been<00:00:58.429> able<00:00:58.550> to<00:00:58.699> do

in<00:01:27.920> the<00:01:28.010> army<00:01:28.190> and<00:01:28.490> he<00:01:28.790> got<00:01:28.910> shipped<00:01:29.150> off<00:01:29.330> for

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:29.660 
in the army and he got shipped off for

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:31.870 
in the army and he got shipped off for
about<00:01:29.720> a<00:01:30.080> long<00:01:30.650> time<00:01:30.890> I<00:01:30.920> want<00:01:31.460> to<00:01:31.520> say<00:01:31.610> if<00:01:31.730> we

00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:31.880 
about a long time I want to say if we

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:33.910 
about a long time I want to say if we
nearly<00:01:32.570> a<00:01:32.750> year<00:01:33.050> i<00:01:33.080> think<00:01:33.380> last<00:01:33.530> year<00:01:33.740> he

00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:33.920 
nearly a year i think last year he

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:35.080 
nearly a year i think last year he
missed<00:01:34.040> a<00:01:34.190> lot<00:01:34.340> of<00:01:34.490> thing<00:01:34.580> he<00:01:34.730> was<00:01:34.850> out<00:01:34.940> of<00:01:34.970> the

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:35.090 
missed a lot of thing he was out of the

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:37.540 
missed a lot of thing he was out of the
game<00:01:35.120> for<00:01:35.510> a<00:01:35.570> while<00:01:35.630> and<00:01:36.020> therefore<00:01:36.920> his

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:37.550 
game for a while and therefore his

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:39.220 
game for a while and therefore his
channel<00:01:38.030> didn't<00:01:38.240> really<00:01:38.420> grow<00:01:38.660> it<00:01:38.840> all<00:01:38.960> is

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:39.230 
channel didn't really grow it all is

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:41.200 
channel didn't really grow it all is
just<00:01:39.350> SAT<00:01:39.590> there<00:01:39.620> so<00:01:40.430> that<00:01:40.670> kind<00:01:40.790> of<00:01:40.910> hurt<00:01:41.090> him

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:41.210 
just SAT there so that kind of hurt him

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:42.910 
just SAT there so that kind of hurt him
but<00:01:41.330> hopefully<00:01:41.480> together<00:01:41.810> we<00:01:42.020> can<00:01:42.260> you<00:01:42.800> know

00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:42.920 
but hopefully together we can you know

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:44.500 
but hopefully together we can you know
