00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920 
watching i'm using the cuda SMG first

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:45.799 
watching i'm using the cuda SMG first
and<00:00:44.100> then<00:00:44.250> later<00:00:44.489> on<00:00:44.640> I<00:00:44.879> start<00:00:45.149> using<00:00:45.300> the<00:00:45.510> VMP

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:45.809 
and then later on I start using the VMP

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:48.529 
and then later on I start using the VMP
which<00:00:46.559> are<00:00:46.739> the<00:00:46.829> two<00:00:47.039> smgs<00:00:47.610> i<00:00:47.850> personally<00:00:48.510> use

00:00:48.529 --> 00:00:48.539 
which are the two smgs i personally use

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:50.420 
which are the two smgs i personally use
the<00:00:48.840> most<00:00:49.079> sadly<00:00:49.770> thing<00:00:49.950> get<00:00:50.100> enough<00:00:50.250> play

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
time on the other two which is a real

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:54.200 
time on the other two which is a real
shame<00:00:52.289> only<00:00:53.129> had<00:00:53.280> three<00:00:53.520> hours<00:00:53.550> to<00:00:53.789> capture

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
shame only had three hours to capture

shame only had three hours to capture
everything<00:00:54.480> I<00:00:54.780> was<00:00:54.870> like<00:00:55.020> I<00:00:55.050> must<00:00:55.379> give

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
everything I was like I must give

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:57.319 
everything I was like I must give
gameplay<00:00:55.980> from<00:00:56.039> every<00:00:56.340> single<00:00:56.489> weapon<00:00:56.699> but

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
gameplay from every single weapon but

00:00:57.329 --> 00:00:59.599 
gameplay from every single weapon but
the<00:00:57.480> CUDA<00:00:57.870> in<00:00:58.020> my<00:00:58.199> opinion<00:00:58.500> is<00:00:58.890> very<00:00:59.309> like<00:00:59.579> the

00:00:59.599 --> 00:00:59.609 
the CUDA in my opinion is very like the

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:01.970 
the CUDA in my opinion is very like the
mp5k<00:01:00.420> from<00:01:00.870> black<00:01:01.020> ops<00:01:01.199> 1<00:01:01.289> it's<00:01:01.590> got<00:01:01.710> a<00:01:01.739> really

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
mp5k from black ops 1 it's got a really

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:04.100 
mp5k from black ops 1 it's got a really
nice<00:01:02.219> iron<00:01:02.550> sight<00:01:02.850> really<00:01:03.510> nice<00:01:03.629> steady<00:01:03.899> rate

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
nice iron sight really nice steady rate

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:06.469 
nice iron sight really nice steady rate
of<00:01:04.229> fire<00:01:04.439> didn't<00:01:04.890> have<00:01:05.010> much<00:01:05.220> recoil<00:01:05.670> and<00:01:05.909> out

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
of fire didn't have much recoil and out

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:09.320 
of fire didn't have much recoil and out
the<00:01:06.810> SMGs<00:01:07.470> i<00:01:07.619> used<00:01:08.010> it<00:01:08.310> was<00:01:08.760> the<00:01:08.880> one<00:01:09.000> that<00:01:09.240> was

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
the SMGs i used it was the one that was

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:11.030 
the SMGs i used it was the one that was
most<00:01:09.570> effective<00:01:10.170> over<00:01:10.530> a<00:01:10.560> longer<00:01:10.799> range

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
most effective over a longer range

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:12.590 
most effective over a longer range
because<00:01:11.400> in<00:01:11.610> previous<00:01:12.060> school<00:01:12.270> juries<00:01:12.570> and

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
because in previous school juries and

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:14.870 
because in previous school juries and
everything<00:01:13.049> SMGs<00:01:13.920> can<00:01:14.250> seem<00:01:14.490> to<00:01:14.640> kind<00:01:14.760> of

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
everything SMGs can seem to kind of

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:16.880 
everything SMGs can seem to kind of
operate<00:01:15.360> at<00:01:15.540> all<00:01:15.750> distances<00:01:16.049> especially<00:01:16.830> in

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
operate at all distances especially in

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:18.200 
operate at all distances especially in
like<00:01:17.009> kind<00:01:17.159> of<00:01:17.250> the<00:01:17.340> black<00:01:17.520> up<00:01:17.670> series<00:01:18.000> when

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
like kind of the black up series when

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:19.940 
like kind of the black up series when
you<00:01:18.330> start<00:01:18.570> thinking<00:01:18.720> backs<00:01:19.110> like<00:01:19.350> the<00:01:19.530> vector

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 
you start thinking backs like the vector

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:22.520 
you start thinking backs like the vector
the<00:01:20.490> mp7<00:01:20.880> and<00:01:21.509> all<00:01:21.630> that<00:01:21.810> stuff<00:01:21.960> that<00:01:22.259> you<00:01:22.380> saw

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
the mp7 and all that stuff that you saw

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:24.080 
the mp7 and all that stuff that you saw
people<00:01:22.830> getting<00:01:23.009> game<00:01:23.159> plays<00:01:23.400> with<00:01:23.610> all<00:01:23.820> the

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
people getting game plays with all the

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:26.179 
people getting game plays with all the
time<00:01:24.360> and<00:01:24.659> it<00:01:25.170> was<00:01:25.290> like<00:01:25.409> okay<00:01:25.770> yeah<00:01:25.979> there's

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189 
time and it was like okay yeah there's

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
see later on in the video actually when

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:31.910 
see later on in the video actually when
i'm<00:01:29.009> using<00:01:29.220> the<00:01:29.310> VMP<00:01:29.579> i<00:01:30.150> cannot<00:01:31.049> kill<00:01:31.380> people

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920

i'm using the VMP i cannot kill people
across<00:01:32.369> range<00:01:32.820> at<00:01:33.119> all<00:01:33.509> the<00:01:34.259> CUDA<00:01:34.829> was<00:01:35.280> a

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 
across range at all the CUDA was a

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:36.679 
across range at all the CUDA was a
little<00:01:35.610> bit<00:01:35.729> more<00:01:35.820> effective<00:01:36.270> at<00:01:36.360> that<00:01:36.479> I<00:01:36.509> was

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:36.689 
little bit more effective at that I was

able to kind of pick people off to
medium-range<00:01:38.340> the<00:01:38.850> VMP<00:01:39.210> close<00:01:39.900> range<00:01:40.290> it<00:01:40.530> was

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:40.799 
medium-range the VMP close range it was

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:42.380 
medium-range the VMP close range it was
absolutely<00:01:41.009> dominate<00:01:41.820> and<00:01:41.880> that's<00:01:42.030> kind<00:01:42.240> of<00:01:42.270> I

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
absolutely dominate and that's kind of I

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:44.690 
absolutely dominate and that's kind of I
love<00:01:42.659> about<00:01:42.869> SMD<00:01:43.530> because<00:01:43.770> everything<00:01:44.430> in

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
love about SMD because everything in

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:46.399 
love about SMD because everything in
previous<00:01:45.180> cool<00:01:45.329> Jews<00:01:45.509> it's<00:01:45.689> like<00:01:45.840> what's

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:54.270 
how SMG should operate in this game

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:55.969 
how SMG should operate in this game
there<00:01:54.659> they<00:01:55.049> allow<00:01:55.259> you<00:01:55.320> to<00:01:55.470> keep<00:01:55.710> it<00:01:55.860> in

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:55.979 
there they allow you to keep it in
