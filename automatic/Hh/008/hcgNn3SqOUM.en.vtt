00:00:00.567 --> 00:00:04.834
The Excise Department of Thailand just released a new policy
(by the government)

00:00:04.901 --> 00:00:09.000
And that's a good news for Thai people 
to buy their very first car

00:00:09.067 --> 00:00:12.234
Just in time before September ends

00:00:12.301 --> 00:00:18.301
Today, let's find out from 3 subcompact sedans with 1.5L, for how this applied

00:00:20.401 --> 00:00:24.067
First, it's Honda City, and it's just minor changed

00:00:25.667 --> 00:00:28.301

00:00:32.201 --> 00:00:35.000
Front: Independent McPherson Struts, ARB
Rear: H-shaped Torsion Beam, ARB

00:00:58.601 --> 00:01:01.467
The interior somehow newer, especially seaters

00:01:14.234 --> 00:01:17.034
5AT with Grade Logic Control, Direct Control, Shift Hold System

00:01:39.701 --> 00:01:42.767
Still powered by 1.5 i-VTEC PGM-Fi DBW 120 HP

00:01:42.834 --> 00:01:46.401
Maximum power: 88kw@6,600rpm
Maximum torque: 145nm@4,800rpm

00:01:49.067 --> 00:01:51.567
4 disc brakes for V and SV

00:01:52.334 --> 00:01:55.701
And it comes with 100,000THB maximum cash back

00:02:02.934 --> 00:02:06.667
Next, Demio Elegance from Mazda, facelifted too

00:02:06.867 --> 00:02:09.000
Spirit AT, 640,000THB

00:02:10.467 --> 00:02:12.534
Only arrived before the City

00:02:12.634 --> 00:02:15.267
Front end surely changed (with a look of 5 door model)

00:02:20.067 --> 00:02:23.134
4ABS / EBD / Dual SRS Airbags now for every Demio models

00:02:24.201 --> 00:02:27.567
And newer look interior

00:02:30.601 --> 00:02:33.967
Console still maintained sporting circular design

00:02:43.067 --> 00:02:45.101
Sporting style dual tone cloth seats

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.367
Quite more storage space than any other in its class

00:03:06.501 --> 00:03:10.301
1,498cc MZR DOHC 16V with S-VT and TSCV 103HP

00:03:10.334 --> 00:03:14.134
Maximum power: 76kw@6,000rpm
Maximum torque: 135nm@4,000rpm

00:03:16.067 --> 00:03:20.934
Front: Independent McPherson Struts, ARB
Rear: Semi-Independent Torsion Beam via Trailing Arm

00:03:26.401 --> 00:03:29.567
With 100,000THB cash back as well

00:03:30.834 --> 00:03:34.000
Both City and Demio Elegance actually displaying 
just not far away each

00:03:35.767 --> 00:03:39.801
Nothing change for this model year of Vios as we know it, 
but Toyota just added a new Vios choice: CNG powered 1.5J

00:03:40.301 --> 00:03:43.067
564,000THB with 100,000THB cash back 
and CNG advantages if you don't fear...

00:03:45.034 --> 00:03:47.834
CNG converted 1NZ-FR VVT-i 4-cyl 1,497cc

00:03:47.867 --> 00:03:50.534
Maximum power: 80kw@6,000rpm
Maximum torque: 141nm@4,200rpm

00:03:51.334 --> 00:03:54.000
70WL CNG tank with Toyota's own stricted standard

00:03:57.401 --> 00:04:02.334
Front: McPherson Struts, ARB
Rear: Torsion Beam

00:04:33.501 --> 00:04:39.534
While Vios is still #1 of B-Segment subcompact sedan in Thailand, Toyota USA just considered to quit the Yaris Sedan

00:04:41.767 --> 00:04:45.067
So all these 3 vehicles will give 100,000THB cash back equally

00:04:45.301 --> 00:04:51.067
All must be by the terms and conditions by Excise Department of Thailand

00:04:51.134 --> 00:04:58.567
The range of cash back of this new policy is between 
10,000THB to 100,000THB, and that's actually "Tax Money"

00:04:58.834 --> 00:05:04.000
However, this latest policy only applied to 
1.5L passenger cars and below

00:05:04.334 --> 00:05:09.167
As well as Eco Cars

00:05:09.434 --> 00:05:12.000
And yes! Pickups

00:05:12.067 --> 00:05:15.634
Double Cab pickups: 57,000THB-100,000THB
Non-Double Cab pickups: 10,000THB-26,000THB

00:05:16.034 --> 00:05:18.134
So you know if you encountered this...

00:05:18.467 --> 00:05:21.201
Don't expect that!

00:05:21.267 --> 00:05:25.000
And never forget! This is only for first time vehicle buyers

00:05:25.034 --> 00:05:29.234
And all these participated vehicles must be assembled 
only in Thailand, not imported
