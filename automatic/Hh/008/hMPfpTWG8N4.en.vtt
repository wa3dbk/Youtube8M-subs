00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:16.630
 with 30 and fire hello everyone I'm bringing you 

00:00:14.349 --> 00:00:19.390
 another walber made on the banks of drift 

00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:22.090
 wood on the east map that comes out good 

00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:24.100
 health alone and in a lighthouse and good is very 

00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:26.710
 simple is just now you are going to see 

00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:28.660
 in this house here the blue house one of 

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:29.860
 the biggest there is as you see 

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:31.630
 just good in this game was 

00:00:29.860 --> 00:00:33.699
 with car there is and we are using 

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:36.249
 the cactus since we can use then 

00:00:33.699 --> 00:00:38.710
 the drone is worth as you are seeing in a 

00:00:36.249 --> 00:00:40.210
 partner puts you the drone and so we can 

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:42.280
 jump inside as you see it like that first 

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:44.320
 we can not jump but if you put the 

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:46.510
 drone right there we jump and we 

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:48.190
 we will put inside what is the house and 

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:50.019
 we can be out there I saw some trolling 

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:52.629
 It is worth but little more since it does not have much 

00:00:50.019 --> 00:00:54.219
 utility is worth we can be here and already 

00:00:52.629 --> 00:00:56.170
 it is but we can not shoot the 

00:00:54.219 --> 00:00:57.909
 enemies because although we dispose the 

00:00:56.170 --> 00:01:00.010
 enemies from within we can not 

00:00:57.909 --> 00:01:02.139
 killing them is worth just as good as 

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:03.909
 I already said it in another video we can 

00:01:02.139 --> 00:01:05.680
 give us a little spin around there and do 

00:01:03.909 --> 00:01:07.990
 that the enemies are crazy 

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:10.420
 and little more as knowing that we are going 

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:12.010
 enter with the drone but there is a way 

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:13.230
 easier to enter this house because 

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:15.100
 here we still had not tried it 

00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:17.140
 right here I decided to put the 

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:18.580
 potatoes these are the nuts there are 

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:19.960
 they say potatoes are potatoes others 

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:22.320
 cheeses walnuts do not know well well what 

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:24.240
 what are they but how are you seeing 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:25.590
 and they go much better because it's like a 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:28.350
 We can use a kind of step 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:29.909
 as a step and it goes well at the time of 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:32.220
 enter and leave it and do not have to 

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:34.740
 be with no partner 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:36.540
 in this way just one single 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:37.680
 could go in and out without any kind of 

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:39.600
 problem is worth it here you will see that 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:42.180
 I restart as other potatoes 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:44.700
 these or nuts or whatever they are worth and it will be 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:46.740
 much easier to enter and exit and 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:49.170
 it's okay so nothing this is the trick 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:50.400
 It is quite curious as I say no 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:52.190
 bring your hands to your head because no 

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:54.840
 we can kill anyone here is worth 

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:56.580
 we can just as you can see there are 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:59.220
 cactus quills stay stuck there 

00:01:56.580 --> 00:02:01.140
 they do not pass from there, so nothing is 

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:03.119
 just for another failure more here in 

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:05.100
 plant for your zombies I guess these 

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:06.720
 they are foolish fools who will be removing 

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:09.149
 this map, you are going to see some more 

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:10.440
 above all and good in other maps is a 

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:11.760
 little more complicated but good is 

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:13.440
 question of looking for vale looks like 

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:14.580
 that they will see more so nothing 

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:15.900
 it is simply this I hope that I have 

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:17.730
 like if you liked to vote the two 

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:20.810
 favorites and see you in the next 

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:20.810
 video greetings to all
