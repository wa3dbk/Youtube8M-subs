00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.210
 I am in favor of the love of seeing the 

00:00:01.260 --> 00:00:05.549
 books as long as I will not be worth 

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:07.740
 the grief clear but what hurts me in the 

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:12.290
 soul is when I open them and this from here 

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:12.290
 is wrinkled and mistreated and I do not play 

00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:19.789
 Y 

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:21.160
 hello welcome this channel if it's the 

00:00:19.789 --> 00:00:23.660
 first time you go through here and 

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:25.849
 welcome again if it's not the first 

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:29.390
 this time I'm going to talk about the 

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:31.700
 dome of steve kean this is a book of 

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:34.970
 science fiction is not terror that this 

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:37.879
 money that Stephen usually handles and 

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:39.500
 start like this is a day in October at 33 

00:00:37.879 --> 00:00:41.809
 thousand all the inhabitants are doing 

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:42.890
 your life 1 are being given is not 

00:00:41.809 --> 00:00:44.690
 doing gardening others are 

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:47.360
 piloting a plane you were in a 

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:49.460
 work outside and puzzles creates a dome 

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:51.920
 transparent that surrounds the entire town 

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:53.960
 and those who were in 

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:55.850
 that moment there 

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:57.950
 and at first they do not realize it 

00:00:55.850 --> 00:01:00.140
 because it is transparent and for example the 

00:00:57.950 --> 00:01:02.570
 that those who were in the plane collide 

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:04.280
 against her and the birds die that I 

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:06.710
 also flying over that space 

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:08.900
 it also hits the one that wanted to leave that 

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:11.210
 place then it is bump against him 

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:13.610
 against the dome some animals that 

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:17.330
 set aside half because it is how it is 

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:19.340
 as though you can hear what 

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:20.479
 they say outsiders and 

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:21.830
 outsiders can or what they say 

00:01:20.479 --> 00:01:23.270
 people inside but do not let go 

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:25.310
 nor leave to anyone the story goes 

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:28.670
 unfolding telling us what it is that 

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:32.929
 happens in different points of testers 

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:36.530
 thousand for example and begin that is the one 

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:38.750
 wants to be the head of the town of the 

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:40.670
 locality how is it harnessed 

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:43.039
 because it has that courage to ruin the 

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:46.159
 life to others and put security 

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:47.880
 of the people and welfare in second 

00:01:46.159 --> 00:01:51.630
 flat and he 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:55.560
 and grow politically or do not know too 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:57.930
 his junior son who is not in all his 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:02:01.079
 mental faculties and when the 

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:03.840
 dome as everyone is seeing then that 

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:06.360
 yes because he does not leave and who put her there 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:08.429
 Well, take advantage of it to carry out 

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:11.310
 some situations also bar came from 

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:13.590
 imbabura an ex-soldier who is the 

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:16.319
 protagonist who was the one who wanted to leave 

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:19.019
 in that moment of the town and that minutes 

00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:21.209
 before the dome fell a car 

00:02:19.019 --> 00:02:22.980
 did not raise it did not give raid and then 

00:02:21.209 --> 00:02:26.220
 it stayed unfortunately inside and 

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:28.140
 everything that has to happen for then because 

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:31.410
 previous situations that was why 

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:33.150
 I wanted to leave him and I do not know that many 

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:35.910
 characters I liked those situations 

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:37.769
 that are presented and also as 

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:39.330
 the everyday things that are inside the 

00:02:37.769 --> 00:02:41.490
 village 

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:43.530
 what's going on and that somehow 

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:44.970
 they do a little bit important for everything 

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:46.800
 that all the inhabitants are living 

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:48.720
 at that time I noticed that 

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:50.580
 some books at least those that I 

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:52.950
 I read Stephen King children 

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:55.590
 always occupy like a special place if 

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:57.240
 they are not the protagonists, it is something very 

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:59.100
 important because they are not children 

00:02:57.240 --> 00:03:01.140
 any children are prodigies who 

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:04.170
 they can do things that adults do 

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:07.230
 in this world you can not do 

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:09.210
 it's like wow what children but they have also 

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:11.580
 noticed that 

00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:14.250
 the story when it's almost going to end 

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:16.980
 baba very well goes great everything was 

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:18.540
 perfect and when it reaches the end it is 

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:20.640
 something very simple I'm not saying that 

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:24.660
 be predictable but it's like seriously 

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:26.160
 that because I feel that it is going away 

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:29.280
 hands or runs out of ideas 

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:31.380
 stephen or so you like the one that like that 

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:34.640
 something so small something is done so 

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:37.710
 big but sometimes we do not notice it or 

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:39.630
 as it is fiction because also something so 

00:03:37.710 --> 00:03:41.640
 that he would like it to happen or what 

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:43.860
 he believes or is not something like that and that does not 

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:46.230
 disappointed on this occasion because 

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:49.140
 I was prepared but also some 

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:51.540
 people can not like them and as not 

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:53.190
 you may like how good is stephen 

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:55.650
 king so there are dead for all 

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:58.170
 parts and sometimes very descriptions 

00:03:55.650 --> 00:04:00.450
 and graphic way how is 

00:03:58.170 --> 00:04:02.730
 taken the story as they are stories 

00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:04.800
 everyday and they explain to you why a 

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:07.380
 character thinks like this or because it is 

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:09.060
 you planning to do something else is going a bit 

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:11.250
 a little dense sometimes 

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:12.870
 I believe that some reader that is not very 

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:16.049
 amateur where he will please both 

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:18.180
 because it's not an agile reading and I think 

00:04:16.049 --> 00:04:21.060
 that you also have to take it into account 

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:22.740
 but if I liked it and if I have to 

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:24.870
 give a score expressions of 4 

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:27.870
 about 5 

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:29.729
 and nothing if not because it says that 

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:31.860
 it seemed if they agree with what 

00:04:29.729 --> 00:04:34.710
 I said or if they have another point of 

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:38.150
 view and if not then if you plan to read it and 

00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:38.150
 also if not if they will let it pass 

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:48.649
 i 

00:04:45.689 --> 00:04:48.649
 ah
