00:02:10.139 --> 00:02:10.149 
chill powder in a blender I was going to

00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:13.650 
chill powder in a blender I was going to
do<00:02:10.300> that<00:02:10.330> but<00:02:10.690> my<00:02:10.780> blenders<00:02:11.170> not<00:02:11.410> working<00:02:12.660> so

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:13.660 
do that but my blenders not working so

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:15.180 
do that but my blenders not working so
you<00:02:13.720> get<00:02:13.930> to<00:02:14.050> see<00:02:14.230> what<00:02:14.410> it<00:02:14.530> originally<00:02:15.040> would

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:15.190 
you get to see what it originally would

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:17.820 
you get to see what it originally would
have<00:02:15.250> look<00:02:15.460> like<00:02:16.080> so<00:02:17.080> that<00:02:17.110> over<00:02:17.530> the<00:02:17.560> heat

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:17.830 
have look like so that over the heat

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:22.520 
have look like so that over the heat
until<00:02:18.280> the<00:02:18.400> noodles<00:02:18.700> are<00:02:18.819> completely<00:02:19.600> cooked

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:22.530 

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:27.210 

if<00:02:23.530> you're<00:02:23.680> going<00:02:23.860> to<00:02:24.510> powder<00:02:25.510> the<00:02:25.690> pasta<00:02:26.530> in

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:27.220 
if you're going to powder the pasta in

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:29.280 
if you're going to powder the pasta in
your<00:02:27.400> blender<00:02:27.730> you<00:02:27.850> can<00:02:28.030> use<00:02:28.150> any<00:02:28.390> wheat<00:02:28.690> pasta

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:29.290 
your blender you can use any wheat pasta

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:32.190 
your blender you can use any wheat pasta
I<00:02:29.590> did<00:02:30.370> originally<00:02:30.940> think<00:02:31.300> that<00:02:31.600> this<00:02:31.780> might

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:32.200 
I did originally think that this might

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:34.350 
I did originally think that this might
have<00:02:32.440> been<00:02:32.470> made<00:02:32.800> with<00:02:33.040> rice<00:02:33.280> vermicelli<00:02:33.790> but

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:34.360 
have been made with rice vermicelli but

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:37.800 
have been made with rice vermicelli but
I<00:02:34.510> found<00:02:34.810> a<00:02:35.230> description<00:02:36.270> in<00:02:37.270> a<00:02:37.420> book<00:02:37.600> called

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:37.810 
I found a description in a book called

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:41.070 
I found a description in a book called

sides in the kitchen from 1893 that
definitely<00:02:41.709> says<00:02:42.069> that<00:02:42.280> it<00:02:42.370> uses<00:02:42.730> wheat<00:02:43.000> them

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:43.330 
definitely says that it uses wheat them

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:45.690 
definitely says that it uses wheat them
each<00:02:43.510> other<00:02:43.720> I<00:02:44.140> have<00:02:44.709> no<00:02:45.010> idea<00:02:45.310> when<00:02:45.459> rice

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:45.700 
each other I have no idea when rice

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:50.320 
each other I have no idea when rice
vermicelli<00:02:46.500> was<00:02:47.500> first<00:02:47.770> available

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:50.330 
vermicelli was first available

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:57.380 
vermicelli was first available
you<00:02:51.020> have<00:02:51.230> to<00:02:51.380> look<00:02:51.500> better

00:02:57.380 --> 00:02:57.390 

00:02:57.390 --> 00:03:00.450 

so<00:02:58.390> this<00:02:58.540> is<00:02:58.660> going<00:02:58.900> to<00:02:59.020> take<00:02:59.200> a<00:02:59.230> while<00:02:59.530> so<00:02:59.830> with

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:00.460 
so this is going to take a while so with

00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:03.060 
so this is going to take a while so with
the<00:03:00.880> magic<00:03:01.270> of<00:03:01.360> video<00:03:01.510> I'm<00:03:02.440> going<00:03:02.740> to<00:03:02.860> come

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:03.070 
the magic of video I'm going to come

00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:04.530 
the magic of video I'm going to come
back<00:03:03.250> and<00:03:03.640> show<00:03:03.850> you<00:03:03.880> what<00:03:04.120> that<00:03:04.150> looks<00:03:04.450> like

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:04.540 
back and show you what that looks like

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:08.370 
back and show you what that looks like
when<00:03:04.840> it's<00:03:05.020> cooked<00:03:06.600> this<00:03:07.600> isn't<00:03:07.990> cooked<00:03:08.230> yet

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:08.380 
when it's cooked this isn't cooked yet

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:09.750 
when it's cooked this isn't cooked yet
but<00:03:08.740> you<00:03:08.830> can<00:03:08.980> see<00:03:09.040> that<00:03:09.340> it's<00:03:09.490> really

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:09.760 
but you can see that it's really

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:12.780 
but you can see that it's really
starting<00:03:10.120> to<00:03:10.360> get<00:03:10.540> thick<00:03:10.870> and<00:03:11.140> creamy<00:03:11.790> I'm

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:12.790 
starting to get thick and creamy I'm

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:16.440 
starting to get thick and creamy I'm
using<00:03:13.000> low-fat<00:03:13.330> milk<00:03:13.780> and<00:03:14.290> this<00:03:14.980> is<00:03:15.450> really

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:16.450 
using low-fat milk and this is really

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:19.140 
using low-fat milk and this is really
getting<00:03:16.780> creamy<00:03:17.460> even<00:03:18.460> though<00:03:18.580> it<00:03:18.700> has<00:03:18.880> no

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:19.150 
getting creamy even though it has no

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:24.650 
getting creamy even though it has no
actual<00:03:19.630> cream<00:03:20.200> in<00:03:20.530> the<00:03:20.650> milk<00:03:20.890> or<00:03:21.850> very<00:03:22.090> little

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:24.660 

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:27.870 

you<00:03:25.660> need<00:03:25.810> to<00:03:25.960> keep<00:03:26.140> stirring<00:03:26.740> this<00:03:26.890> you<00:03:27.670> want

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:27.880 
you need to keep stirring this you want

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:30.420 
you need to keep stirring this you want
the<00:03:28.030> starch<00:03:28.300> to<00:03:28.990> come<00:03:29.200> out<00:03:29.410> of<00:03:29.620> the<00:03:29.770> pasta<00:03:30.220> into

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:30.430 
the starch to come out of the pasta into

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:33.660 
the starch to come out of the pasta into
the<00:03:30.580> milk<00:03:30.880> and<00:03:31.860> you<00:03:32.860> don't<00:03:33.070> want<00:03:33.250> it<00:03:33.310> to<00:03:33.430> stick

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:33.670

together

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:35.130 
together

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:42.490 
way through and this is really really

00:03:42.490 --> 00:03:46.800

with water up to the same level as the
pudding<00:06:28.970> and<00:06:29.180> that<00:06:29.720> will<00:06:29.870> stop<00:06:30.110> it<00:06:30.140> browning

00:06:30.730 --> 00:06:30.740
