it was removed is just because no one

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:21.980 
very long I just seemed like a needless

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:23.830 
very long I just seemed like a needless
filler<00:02:22.250> at<00:02:22.640> the<00:02:22.849> end<00:02:23.000> so<00:02:23.209> that<00:02:23.390> was<00:02:23.599> been

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:23.840 
filler at the end so that was been

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:25.960 
filler at the end so that was been
removed<00:02:24.230> but<00:02:24.380> outside<00:02:24.739> that<00:02:24.980> nothing<00:02:25.819> else

00:04:11.820 --> 00:04:11.830 
running it on a max pc and the new

00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:14.030 
running it on a max pc and the new
lighting<00:04:12.190> effect<00:04:12.520> it's<00:04:12.820> nice<00:04:13.090> but<00:04:13.840> it's

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:14.040 
lighting effect it's nice but it's

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:17.120 
lighting effect it's nice but it's
overbearing<00:04:15.040> a<00:04:15.160> time<00:04:15.400> so<00:04:15.760> it<00:04:15.970> gets<00:04:16.090> a<00:04:16.269> really

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:17.130 
overbearing a time so it gets a really

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:19.650 
overbearing a time so it gets a really
really<00:04:18.130> good<00:04:18.370> wash<00:04:18.579> out<00:04:18.850> a<00:04:18.880> lot<00:04:19.120> of<00:04:19.209> the<00:04:19.299> colors

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:19.660 
really good wash out a lot of the colors

00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:21.150 
really good wash out a lot of the colors
i<00:04:19.690> think<00:04:20.109> they<00:04:20.200> should<00:04:20.380> have<00:04:20.410> toned<00:04:20.769> it<00:04:20.950> down<00:04:20.980> a

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:21.160 
i think they should have toned it down a

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:24.510 
i think they should have toned it down a
bit<00:04:21.370> but<00:04:22.270> it's<00:04:23.230> not<00:04:23.380> game<00:04:23.620> crippling<00:04:24.070> so<00:04:24.280> i<00:04:24.340> can

00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:24.520 
bit but it's not game crippling so i can

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:26.460 
bit but it's not game crippling so i can
really<00:04:24.820> experience<00:04:25.180> it<00:04:25.390> just<00:04:25.630> make<00:04:25.900> as<00:04:26.140> i<00:04:26.290> said

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:26.470 
really experience it just make as i said

00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:28.080 
really experience it just make as i said
make<00:04:26.680> some<00:04:26.860> of<00:04:26.920> the<00:04:26.980> environment<00:04:27.550> seem<00:04:27.760> washed
