00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:49.420 
have got to kill a little sooner but as

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:52.240 
have got to kill a little sooner but as
hipfire<00:01:50.420> always<00:01:50.840> is<00:01:51.050> you<00:01:51.259> never<00:01:51.410> know<00:01:51.710> it's

hipfire always is you never know it's
pretty<00:01:52.580> random<00:01:53.500> so<00:01:54.500> you<00:01:54.560> think<00:01:54.860> your<00:01:54.979> shot

00:01:55.149 --> 00:01:55.159 
pretty random so you think your shot

00:01:55.159 --> 00:01:57.850 
pretty random so you think your shot
should<00:01:55.490> have<00:01:55.640> hit<00:01:55.820> but<00:01:56.210> in<00:01:57.140> reality<00:01:57.409> they

00:01:57.850 --> 00:01:57.860
