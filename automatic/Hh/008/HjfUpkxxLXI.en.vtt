just<00:00:42.149> with<00:00:42.270> the<00:00:42.420> larger<00:00:42.809> crate<00:00:43.379> and<00:00:44.809> I<00:00:45.809> made<00:00:46.230> an

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:46.590 
just with the larger crate and I made an

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:50.090 
just with the larger crate and I made an
example<00:00:46.980> here<00:00:47.629> now<00:00:48.629> I<00:00:48.660> was<00:00:48.989> too<00:00:49.200> lazy<00:00:49.410> to<00:00:49.920> build

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
example here now I was too lazy to build

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:52.250 
example here now I was too lazy to build
a<00:00:50.219> natural<00:00:50.640> ejection<00:00:51.120> see<00:00:51.270> and<00:00:51.420> i<00:00:51.480> just<00:00:51.719> put

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260

welded stuff together so if i press the

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:57.110 
welded stuff together so if i press the
button<00:00:55.649> for<00:00:55.770> this<00:00:55.920> right<00:00:56.100> now<00:00:56.129> he<00:00:56.850> would<00:00:56.969> not

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
button for this right now he would not

fly away so but in my tutorial when I

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:05.030 
fly away so but in my tutorial when I
build<00:01:01.890> it<00:01:02.070> I<00:01:02.100> it<00:01:02.250> will<00:01:02.609> fly<00:01:02.850> away<00:01:02.910> I<00:01:03.949> did<00:01:04.949> the

shots I suggest one damage 100 bullets
spread<00:02:59.850> zero<00:03:01.190> bullet<00:03:02.190> force<00:03:02.519> I<00:03:02.880> actually

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:03.120 
spread zero bullet force I actually

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:07.310 
spread zero bullet force I actually
suggest<00:03:03.780> bringing<00:03:03.930> it<00:03:04.140> down<00:03:04.290> to<00:03:05.180> zero<00:03:06.180> or<00:03:06.480> you

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:07.320 
suggest bringing it down to zero or you

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:10.880 
suggest bringing it down to zero or you
know<00:03:07.410> the<00:03:07.620> point<00:03:08.100> one<00:03:08.340> whatever<00:03:09.180> la<00:03:09.959> whatever

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:10.890 
know the point one whatever la whatever

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:14.000 
know the point one whatever la whatever
that<00:03:11.010> says<00:03:11.220> right<00:03:11.370> there<00:03:11.400> and<00:03:11.930> toggle<00:03:12.930> no<00:03:13.530> you

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:14.010 
that says right there and toggle no you

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:15.319 
that says right there and toggle no you
really<00:03:14.220> don't<00:03:14.400> want<00:03:14.609> toggle<00:03:14.970> free<00:03:15.090> the

00:03:15.319 --> 00:03:15.329 
really don't want toggle free the

00:03:15.329 --> 00:03:22.430 
really don't want toggle free the
thruster<00:03:15.810> or<00:03:16.670> Turing<00:03:19.760> alright<00:03:20.760> so<00:03:21.440> this

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:22.440 
thruster or Turing alright so this

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:23.840 
thruster or Turing alright so this
thruster<00:03:22.890> has<00:03:22.980> already<00:03:23.130> been<00:03:23.310> put<00:03:23.519> on<00:03:23.640> you

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:23.850 
thruster has already been put on you

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:28.190 
thruster has already been put on you
wanted<00:03:24.090> to<00:03:24.209> put<00:03:24.390> in<00:03:24.540> the<00:03:24.660> middle<00:03:25.970> so<00:03:26.970> if<00:03:27.959> you

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:28.200 
wanted to put in the middle so if you

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:29.840 
wanted to put in the middle so if you
put<00:03:28.350> it<00:03:28.470> on<00:03:28.530> like<00:03:28.829> in<00:03:29.040> the<00:03:29.130> back<00:03:29.310> and<00:03:29.609> then<00:03:29.730> it

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:29.850 
put it on like in the back and then it

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:31.970 
put it on like in the back and then it
will<00:03:29.940> start<00:03:30.120> doing<00:03:30.359> a<00:03:30.420> bunch<00:03:30.600> of<00:03:30.660> flips<00:03:30.989> and<00:03:31.260> if

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:31.980 
will start doing a bunch of flips and if

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:33.170 
will start doing a bunch of flips and if
you're<00:03:32.130> writing<00:03:32.340> that<00:03:32.640> you<00:03:32.670> really<00:03:33.090> don't

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:33.180 
you're writing that you really don't

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:36.490 
you're writing that you really don't
want<00:03:33.420> that<00:03:33.980> well<00:03:34.980> maybe<00:03:35.160> some<00:03:35.400> of<00:03:35.430> you<00:03:35.609> do<00:03:35.760> but

00:03:36.490 --> 00:03:36.500 
want that well maybe some of you do but

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:38.539 
want that well maybe some of you do but
alright<00:03:37.500> so<00:03:37.709> put<00:03:37.980> it<00:03:38.070> somewhere<00:03:38.370> where

00:03:38.539 --> 00:03:38.549 
alright so put it somewhere where

00:03:38.549 --> 00:03:39.890 
alright so put it somewhere where
they'll<00:03:38.880> have<00:03:39.000> plenty<00:03:39.030> of<00:03:39.420> room<00:03:39.600> for<00:03:39.630> this

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:39.900 
they'll have plenty of room for this

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:47.030 
they'll have plenty of room for this
turret<00:03:42.709> all<00:03:43.709> right<00:03:43.890> flip<00:03:44.850> it<00:03:44.970> over<00:03:46.040> alright

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:47.040 
turret all right flip it over alright

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:51.910 
turret all right flip it over alright
and<00:03:47.720> freeze<00:03:48.720> it<00:03:48.750> around<00:03:50.450> right<00:03:51.450> around<00:03:51.660> there

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:51.920 
and freeze it around right around there

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:56.000 
and freeze it around right around there
so<00:03:52.920> it's<00:03:53.130> not<00:03:53.250> fully<00:03:53.639> seen<00:03:54.980> alright<00:03:55.980> you

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:56.010 
so it's not fully seen alright you

00:03:56.010 --> 00:03:58.699 
so it's not fully seen alright you
actually<00:03:56.430> panic<00:03:56.910> pointing<00:03:57.359> towards<00:03:57.840> whatever

00:03:58.699 --> 00:03:58.709 
actually panic pointing towards whatever

00:03:58.709 --> 00:04:04.280 
actually panic pointing towards whatever
is<00:03:59.160> there<00:03:59.370> now<00:04:00.269> weld<00:04:01.579> alright<00:04:02.579> weld<00:04:02.819> that<00:04:03.810> the

is there now weld alright weld that the

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:08.360 
is there now weld alright weld that the
turrets<00:04:04.680> to<00:04:05.400> the<00:04:05.519> seat<00:04:05.900> will<00:04:06.900> deter<00:04:07.290> it<00:04:07.440> to<00:04:08.190> the

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:08.370 
turrets to the seat will deter it to the

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:09.870 
turrets to the seat will deter it to the
wood

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:09.880 
wood

00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:13.200 
wood

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:17.130 
all and you just made the ejection seat

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:21.060 
all and you just made the ejection seat
now<00:04:18.130> I'm<00:04:18.489> going<00:04:18.730> to<00:04:19.150> bring<00:04:19.840> you<00:04:20.050> to<00:04:20.260> a<00:04:20.290> map<00:04:20.590> why

you what the insertion single do okay

00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:33.120 
you what the insertion single do okay
that<00:04:30.910> wasn't<00:04:31.120> the<00:04:31.330> best<00:04:31.510> model<00:04:32.010> because<00:04:33.010> I

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:33.130 
that wasn't the best model because I

00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:36.180

don't<00:04:33.280> think<00:04:33.490> I<00:04:33.550> put<00:04:33.760> it<00:04:33.880> in<00:04:34.950> straight<00:04:35.950> in<00:04:36.130> the

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:36.190 
don't think I put it in straight in the

don't think I put it in straight in the
middle<00:04:37.710> yeah<00:04:38.710> I<00:04:38.740> didn't<00:04:39.010> put<00:04:39.160> it<00:04:39.250> straight<00:04:39.430> in

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:39.610 
middle yeah I didn't put it straight in

00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:42.570 
middle yeah I didn't put it straight in
the<00:04:39.670> middle<00:04:39.880> but<00:04:40.870> in<00:04:41.140> this<00:04:41.650> next<00:04:41.980> and<00:04:42.340> I'm
