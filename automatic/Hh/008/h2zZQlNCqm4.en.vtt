00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:23.789 
put it back up so I decided to do a

quick<00:00:24.090> video<00:00:24.330> clip<00:00:25.369> kind<00:00:26.369> of<00:00:26.430> highlighting<00:00:26.910> my

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:27.029 
quick video clip kind of highlighting my

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:29.000 
quick video clip kind of highlighting my
journey<00:00:27.330> a<00:00:27.630> lot<00:00:27.930> of<00:00:28.050> the<00:00:28.140> pictures<00:00:28.260> that<00:00:28.619> I<00:00:28.650> had

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:29.010 
journey a lot of the pictures that I had

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:31.189 
journey a lot of the pictures that I had
in<00:00:29.250> the<00:00:29.340> initial<00:00:29.699> album<00:00:30.060> I'd<00:00:30.240> lost<00:00:30.420> so<00:00:31.050> I'm

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:31.199 
in the initial album I'd lost so I'm

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:33.950 
in the initial album I'd lost so I'm
just<00:00:31.349> going<00:00:31.529> to<00:00:31.590> go<00:00:32.309> with<00:00:32.520> what<00:00:32.700> I've<00:00:32.820> got

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:33.960 
just going to go with what I've got

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:39.889 
just going to go with what I've got
initially<00:00:34.800> my<00:00:38.180> inspiration<00:00:39.180> for<00:00:39.360> locking<00:00:39.570> was

00:00:39.889 --> 00:00:39.899 
initially my inspiration for locking was

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:42.260 
initially my inspiration for locking was
Lauryn<00:00:40.230> Hill<00:00:40.440> I<00:00:40.710> loved<00:00:41.100> the<00:00:41.550> way<00:00:41.670> she<00:00:41.910> wore<00:00:42.120> her

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270 
Lauryn Hill I loved the way she wore her

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:44.360 
Lauryn Hill I loved the way she wore her
hair<00:00:42.300> and<00:00:42.809> there<00:00:43.110> was<00:00:43.260> this<00:00:43.530> particular

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
hair and there was this particular

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:48.470 
hair and there was this particular
picture<00:00:44.820> of<00:00:45.480> her<00:00:45.829> with<00:00:46.829> these<00:00:47.039> coils<00:00:47.489> that<00:00:48.149> I

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:48.480 
picture of her with these coils that I

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:51.439 
picture of her with these coils that I
really<00:00:48.989> really<00:00:49.289> wanted<00:00:49.559> so<00:00:50.280> that's<00:00:51.059> the<00:00:51.300> way<00:00:51.420> I

00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:51.449 
really really wanted so that's the way I

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:53.810 
really really wanted so that's the way I
started<00:00:52.170> locking<00:00:52.350> I<00:00:52.739> locked<00:00:53.309> from<00:00:53.489> a<00:00:53.520> perm

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820 
started locking I locked from a perm

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:56.060 
started locking I locked from a perm
I've<00:00:54.719> been<00:00:54.930> wearing<00:00:55.079> my<00:00:55.199> hair<00:00:55.379> in<00:00:55.469> braids<00:00:55.710> and

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
I've been wearing my hair in braids and

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:58.610 
I've been wearing my hair in braids and
and<00:00:56.430> we<00:00:57.210> used<00:00:57.360> for<00:00:57.539> quite<00:00:57.750> some<00:00:57.989> time<00:00:58.199> so<00:00:58.440> I<00:00:58.500> had

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
and we used for quite some time so I had

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:00.349 
and we used for quite some time so I had
a<00:00:58.649> lot<00:00:58.800> of<00:00:58.949> new<00:00:59.039> growth<00:00:59.280> but<00:00:59.640> my<00:00:59.969> ends<00:01:00.239> were

00:01:00.349 --> 00:01:00.359 
a lot of new growth but my ends were

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:02.630 
a lot of new growth but my ends were
still<00:01:00.600> permed<00:01:00.870> so<00:01:01.260> I<00:01:01.680> essentially<00:01:02.520> just

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640 
still permed so I essentially just

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:06.080 
still permed so I essentially just
coiled<00:01:03.420> my<00:01:03.719> hair<00:01:03.930> down<00:01:04.400> with<00:01:05.400> the<00:01:05.580> perm<00:01:05.790> end

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
coiled my hair down with the perm end

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:07.820 
coiled my hair down with the perm end
and<00:01:06.479> I<00:01:06.689> just<00:01:06.869> wore<00:01:07.049> it<00:01:07.080> like<00:01:07.229> that<00:01:07.380> until<00:01:07.590> it

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
and I just wore it like that until it

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:10.700 
and I just wore it like that until it
locked<00:01:08.040> I'm<00:01:08.400> in<00:01:08.729> this<00:01:08.850> first<00:01:09.090> picture<00:01:09.439> my<00:01:10.439> hair

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
locked I'm in this first picture my hair

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:12.730 
locked I'm in this first picture my hair
is<00:01:10.979> fully<00:01:11.340> locked<00:01:11.580> um

00:01:12.730 --> 00:01:12.740 
is fully locked um

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:15.649 
is fully locked um
it's<00:01:13.740> not<00:01:13.920> the<00:01:14.070> initial<00:01:14.250> pictures<00:01:14.729> I<00:01:14.760> can't<00:01:15.420> I

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:15.659 
it's not the initial pictures I can't I

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:17.120 
it's not the initial pictures I can't I
have<00:01:15.960> them<00:01:16.170> I<00:01:16.229> have<00:01:16.350> to<00:01:16.380> find<00:01:16.650> them<00:01:16.830> and<00:01:16.860> I'll

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
have them I have to find them and I'll

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:19.580 
have them I have to find them and I'll
post<00:01:17.700> them<00:01:17.909> so<00:01:18.780> this<00:01:19.110> is<00:01:19.200> probably<00:01:19.409> about<00:01:19.500> a

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
post them so this is probably about a

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:22.190 
post them so this is probably about a
year<00:01:19.979> into<00:01:20.189> my<00:01:20.490> journey<00:01:20.780> like<00:01:21.780> I<00:01:21.840> said<00:01:21.990> my<00:01:22.080> hair

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
year into my journey like I said my hair

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:23.840 
year into my journey like I said my hair
was<00:01:22.229> fully<00:01:22.530> locked<00:01:22.799> and<00:01:23.159> I<00:01:23.189> just<00:01:23.460> coiled<00:01:23.670> it

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
was fully locked and I just coiled it

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:28.420 
was fully locked and I just coiled it
down<00:01:24.030> or<00:01:25.100> for<00:01:26.100> this<00:01:26.220> particular<00:01:26.869> photo<00:01:27.869> shoot

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:28.430 
down or for this particular photo shoot

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:30.710 
down or for this particular photo shoot
so<00:01:29.430> that's<00:01:29.939> why<00:01:30.060> I<00:01:30.119> would<00:01:30.270> wear<00:01:30.420> my<00:01:30.450> hair

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720 
so that's why I would wear my hair

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:32.030 
so that's why I would wear my hair
everyday<00:01:30.930> it<00:01:31.200> took<00:01:31.380> about<00:01:31.500> seven<00:01:31.920> or<00:01:32.009> eight

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
everyday it took about seven or eight

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:34.130 
everyday it took about seven or eight
months<00:01:32.460> for<00:01:32.670> it<00:01:32.790> to<00:01:32.939> lock<00:01:33.119> in<00:01:33.420> between<00:01:33.780> I<00:01:33.810> would

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140 
months for it to lock in between I would

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:37.039 
months for it to lock in between I would
just<00:01:34.290> wear<00:01:34.409> head<00:01:34.650> wraps<00:01:35.000> finally<00:01:36.000> I<00:01:36.329> got<00:01:36.750> tired

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:37.049 
just wear head wraps finally I got tired

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:40.219 
just wear head wraps finally I got tired
of<00:01:37.820> those<00:01:38.820> permed<00:01:39.240> end<00:01:39.600> sticking<00:01:40.020> out

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
of those permed end sticking out

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:43.310 
of those permed end sticking out
everywhere<00:01:40.380> so<00:01:41.040> in<00:01:41.250> this<00:01:41.400> picture<00:01:42.320> I'd

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.320 
everywhere so in this picture I'd

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:46.010 
everywhere so in this picture I'd
actually<00:01:43.649> cut<00:01:43.829> the<00:01:43.950> ends<00:01:44.220> off<00:01:44.310> and<00:01:44.810> about<00:01:45.810> this

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
actually cut the ends off and about this

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:47.600 
actually cut the ends off and about this
time<00:01:46.079> I<00:01:46.350> used<00:01:46.619> I<00:01:46.799> loved<00:01:47.009> it<00:01:47.130> with<00:01:47.220> my<00:01:47.310> hair<00:01:47.460> was

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:47.610 
time I used I loved it with my hair was

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:49.550 
time I used I loved it with my hair was
this<00:01:47.729> length<00:01:48.030> because<00:01:48.299> I<00:01:48.390> would<00:01:48.570> just<00:01:48.720> pin<00:01:48.990> pin

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:49.560 
this length because I would just pin pin

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:51.710 
this length because I would just pin pin
curl<00:01:49.799> it<00:01:49.979> I<00:01:50.210> would<00:01:51.210> just<00:01:51.240> take<00:01:51.509> the<00:01:51.600> little

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:51.720 
curl it I would just take the little

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:56.389 
curl it I would just take the little
metal<00:01:52.049> clips<00:01:52.649> and<00:01:54.020> pin<00:01:55.020> it<00:01:55.140> up<00:01:55.259> and<00:01:55.560> I<00:01:55.950> take<00:01:56.250> it

00:01:56.389 --> 00:01:56.399 
metal clips and pin it up and I take it

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:58.730 
metal clips and pin it up and I take it
down<00:01:56.520> and<00:01:56.850> this<00:01:57.000> is<00:01:57.060> what<00:01:57.299> I<00:01:57.329> had<00:01:57.619> at<00:01:58.619> this

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:58.740 
down and this is what I had at this

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:00.530 
down and this is what I had at this
point<00:01:59.070> my<00:01:59.219> hair<00:01:59.399> wasn't<00:01:59.640> long<00:01:59.909> enough<00:02:00.119> to<00:02:00.360> put
