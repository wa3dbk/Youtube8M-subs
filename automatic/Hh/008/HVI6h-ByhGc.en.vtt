00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.490
 the core of the earth rotates to different 

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:08.099
 speeds accelerating and decelerating 

00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:10.260
 frequently and this movement is not 

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:12.990
 synchronized with that of the remaining mass 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:15.570
 of the planet according to a reported study 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:17.400
 today in australia the investigation 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:19.890
 led by buffett to the cic of the 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:22.439
 australian national university anna 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:24.900
 revealed that not only the turnover rate 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:26.849
 of the nucleus is different from that of the mantle 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:30.060
 layer that is below the crust 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:32.309
 terrestrial but also its speed 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:34.829
 is variable is the first evidence 

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:37.770
 experimental that the nucleus rotates to 

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:39.719
 different speeds said calcite in 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:41.640
 a statement from the master the 

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:44.370
 researchers discovered that in 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:46.250
 comparison with the mantle the broken core 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:50.670
 is going faster than the decade 

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:53.550
 1970 and 1990 but slowed down in the 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:55.260
 80 the most dramatic acceleration 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:58.170
 probably happened in the past 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:01:00.660
 years although we need to make older 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:03.180
 tests to confirm this observation 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:05.309
 commented that the cic to remember that the 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:06.750
 angie model speculated that the layers 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:11.010
 internal of the earth 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:13.680
 they go at different speed of 1692 for 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:16.680
 effects of the study the expert in physics 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:19.140
 and mathematics analyzed through a 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:21.780
 novel method the records of the 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:23.970
 earthquakes doublets of the last 50 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:26.490
 years to measure the speed of the 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:28.860
 rotation of the earth 's core 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:30.960
 double earthquakes are two earthquakes of 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:32.820
 almost identical magnitude that can 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:35.280
 register in a period that varies 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:37.729
 between a couple of weeks to forty years 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:39.930
 and that differ from the replicas 

00:01:37.729 --> 00:01:42.180
 Calcico commented that he thought 

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:45.600
 exciting to see that even with a 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:48.450
 difference of 10 20 or 30 years these 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:51.119
 earthquakes resemble each pair has 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:53.580
 a slight difference and this corresponds 

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:55.860
 to the nucleus we have been able to use this 

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:57.630
 difference to reconstruct the story 

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:59.700
 how the core has rotated in the 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:01.619
 last 50 years 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:03.750
 Carl Seel believes that his new method 

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:05.700
 will help to understand the role of 

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:07.680
 terrestrial nucleus in the creation of 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:09.570
 magnetic field that allowed the 

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:11.130
 evolution of life on the planet to 

00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:13.140
 act as a shield against 

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:16.220
 Cosmic radiation according to 

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:16.220
