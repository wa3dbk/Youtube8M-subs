 lengthen this first video we are going to 

00:00:54.969 --> 00:00:58.360
 start with the players that have 

00:00:56.860 --> 00:01:00.670
 given obviously many are not their 

00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:03.940
 natural positions and good we have in 

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:07.570
 Domingue goal every wall or snow 

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:10.960

 martínez rafael van der vaart sámaras and 

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:18.460

 valencia- icon and good as you are 

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:28.690
 seeing the truth that to be a team 

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:30.130
 initial is not bad 

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:32.590
 there are players who can take advantage 

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:34.870
 as they are more verbal sámara 20 than 

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:37.210
 even reservations with joel matip and 

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:40.840
 valencia- and good continuation I bring 

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:42.400
 here the two first pages of the club the 

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:44.680
 truth is that he has touched the odd 

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:46.060
 jugadorazo that you can see that we have 

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:47.560
 phillip island 

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:50.020
 eden hazard that came out in the second 

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:51.250
 about the level or believed you have to prove it 

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:52.930
 yes or yes because he has never had the 

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:54.310
 Ultimate opportunity for the pro 

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:56.380
 vastese player not only play with 

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:58.630
 barclays also never had to leave a 

00:01:56.380 --> 00:02:01.030
 about and here you can make good connection 

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:03.130
 with 20 we already have it here in link and 

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:05.530
 santi cazorla javi martínez that you see 

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:07.990
 is in 57 of rhythm that is loaded in my 

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:08.470
 other square view is by 

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:12.100
 excellence 

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:14.320
 rossi samuel eto'o 2 mikel essien raul 

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:17.020
 meireles and the second page we have a 

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:18.180
 players like denisov obi mikel patrice 

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:20.640
 evra 

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:21.830
 the left side along with philipp 

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:25.400
 lahm 

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:26.840
 blige astori afellay and that too 

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:28.670
 they come very well 

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:29.990
 ansaldi that is a lateral that to me 

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:31.160
 love it already proven in the last 

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:34.910
 year-old instinct will have to see 

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:36.230
 how it goes with the Argentine team other 

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:37.820
 been more with the moon with the iess 

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:39.800
 mercer the player of borussia 

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:42.470
 dortmund and well those are the players 

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:44.960
 which I now have in the club as 

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:48.290
 highlighted along with the initial team in 

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:50.000
 the second episode depending on which 

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:51.260
 now when I make the first team 

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.360
 see if I have enough players in 

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:56.540
 each position or not because the same assumes 

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:58.960
 a paco penny or good game and the 

00:02:56.540 --> 00:03:01.000
 first matches with that team 

00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:03.550
 and then you get only temporary gum that 

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.840
 another one especially to depend on who has 

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:07.120
 the player is enough I'm not going to 

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:09.400
 play with players who are not in 

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:10.570
 Your natural position is good to be 

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:12.970
 First floor I think it's pretty good 

00:03:10.570 --> 00:03:14.110
 a video is informative but it's 

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:16.930
 to see if this model meets the 

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:18.400
 expectation gave him out there that is not 

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:19.840
 players need so many rhythms 

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:21.460
 that we import other attributes like the 

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:23.950
 force and others but until I do not 

00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:25.750
 happens first hand I'm not going to trust 

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:28.600
 of that information and good up to here 

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:31.120
 the first episode I hope there's 

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:32.500
