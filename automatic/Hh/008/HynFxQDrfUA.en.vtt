do think collectively you know people
running<00:02:33.420> for<00:02:33.630> president<00:02:34.560> might<00:02:34.770> you<00:02:35.459> know<00:02:35.580> be

she<00:03:03.420> is<00:03:03.569> so<00:03:03.690> she<00:03:03.900> must<00:03:04.230> be<00:03:04.350> very<00:03:04.380> unlikely<00:03:04.769> she

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:05.310 
she is so she must be very unlikely she

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:08.150 
she is so she must be very unlikely she
speaks<00:03:05.640> a<00:03:05.760> lot<00:03:05.910> about<00:03:05.970> love<00:03:06.510> and<00:03:07.080> she's<00:03:07.620> more

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:08.160 
speaks a lot about love and she's more

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:10.309 
speaks a lot about love and she's more
of<00:03:08.340> a<00:03:08.519> like<00:03:08.940> a<00:03:08.970> spiritual<00:03:09.630> leader<00:03:09.870> but<00:03:10.140> she's

00:03:10.309 --> 00:03:10.319 
of a like a spiritual leader but she's

00:03:10.319 --> 00:03:12.890 
of a like a spiritual leader but she's
running<00:03:10.530> for<00:03:10.980> some<00:03:11.790> seat<00:03:12.090> somewhere<00:03:12.630> right

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:12.900 
running for some seat somewhere right

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:15.979 
running for some seat somewhere right
now<00:03:13.140> so<00:03:13.410> but<00:03:13.680> like<00:03:14.400> Al<00:03:14.610> Franken<00:03:15.239> kind<00:03:15.540> of<00:03:15.720> did

00:03:15.979 --> 00:03:15.989 
now so but like Al Franken kind of did

00:03:15.989 --> 00:03:17.810 
now so but like Al Franken kind of did
that<00:03:16.019> he<00:03:16.500> cracked<00:03:16.920> it<00:03:17.070> open<00:03:17.160> because<00:03:17.489> it<00:03:17.610> made

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:17.820 
that he cracked it open because it made

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:20.750 
that he cracked it open because it made
the<00:03:18.360> media<00:03:18.750> pay<00:03:19.160> attention<00:03:20.160> to<00:03:20.400> him<00:03:20.549> so<00:03:20.730> I

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:20.760 
the media pay attention to him so I

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:23.150 
the media pay attention to him so I
think<00:03:21.209> it's<00:03:21.329> less<00:03:21.600> about<00:03:21.750> the<00:03:21.870> money<00:03:22.260> and<00:03:22.560> more

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:23.160 
think it's less about the money and more

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:27.920 
think it's less about the money and more
about<00:03:23.400> can<00:03:23.730> you<00:03:24.090> get<00:03:24.780> new<00:03:25.140> life<00:03:25.799> into<00:03:26.930> politics

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:27.930 
about can you get new life into politics

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:30.470 
about can you get new life into politics
yeah<00:03:28.440> is<00:03:28.709> it<00:03:29.130> just<00:03:29.310> a<00:03:29.370> sad<00:03:29.640> state<00:03:29.970> of<00:03:30.000> American

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:30.480 
yeah is it just a sad state of American

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:31.610 
yeah is it just a sad state of American
politics<00:03:30.840> though<00:03:31.019> that<00:03:31.170> we<00:03:31.260> might<00:03:31.410> need<00:03:31.560> a

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:31.620 
politics though that we might need a

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:34.370 
politics though that we might need a
billionaire<00:03:32.310> to<00:03:32.549> actually<00:03:33.030> get<00:03:33.390> money<00:03:33.570> out<00:03:33.690> I

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:34.380 
billionaire to actually get money out I

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:36.890 
billionaire to actually get money out I
yeah<00:03:34.799> I<00:03:35.100> don't<00:03:35.489> think<00:03:35.730> so<00:03:36.269> I<00:03:36.299> think<00:03:36.510> the<00:03:36.600> sadder

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:36.900 
yeah I don't think so I think the sadder

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:39.110 
yeah I don't think so I think the sadder

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:45.540 
presidency that is a fact I mean I just

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:46.819 
presidency that is a fact I mean I just
don't<00:03:45.900> see<00:03:46.230> it<00:03:46.380> happening

00:03:46.819 --> 00:03:46.829 
don't see it happening

00:03:46.829 --> 00:03:49.430 
don't see it happening
even<00:03:47.130> if<00:03:47.250> Oprah<00:03:47.640> throws<00:03:47.970> or<00:03:48.150> her<00:03:48.480> you<00:03:48.720> know<00:03:48.870> hat

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:49.440 
even if Oprah throws or her you know hat

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:51.470 
even if Oprah throws or her you know hat
in<00:03:49.620> the<00:03:49.739> ring<00:03:49.920> yeah<00:03:50.280> I<00:03:50.459> think<00:03:50.609> what<00:03:51.030> that

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:51.480 
in the ring yeah I think what that

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:54.530 
in the ring yeah I think what that
accomplishes<00:03:52.260> is<00:03:52.890> what<00:03:53.100> Nader<00:03:53.820> accomplished

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:54.540 
accomplishes is what Nader accomplished

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:56.840 
accomplishes is what Nader accomplished
and<00:03:54.750> what<00:03:55.320> Perot<00:03:55.650> accomplished<00:03:56.400> which<00:03:56.579> means

00:03:56.840 --> 00:03:56.850 
and what Perot accomplished which means

00:03:56.850 --> 00:03:59.150 
and what Perot accomplished which means
the<00:03:57.359> person<00:03:57.570> who's<00:03:57.900> actually<00:03:58.079> closest<00:03:58.920> to<00:03:59.070> you

00:03:59.150 --> 00:03:59.160 
the person who's actually closest to you

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:02.090 
the person who's actually closest to you
on<00:03:59.310> the<00:03:59.459> political<00:03:59.880> spectrum<00:04:00.230> loses<00:04:01.230> because

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:02.100 
on the political spectrum loses because

00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:03.800 
on the political spectrum loses because
of<00:04:02.310> you<00:04:02.489> yeah<00:04:02.880> so<00:04:03.120> I<00:04:03.150> just<00:04:03.329> think<00:04:03.510> the<00:04:03.600> third

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:03.810 
of you yeah so I just think the third

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:05.870 
of you yeah so I just think the third
party<00:04:04.109> system<00:04:04.500> Al<00:04:04.680> Gore<00:04:05.100> right<00:04:05.609> you<00:04:05.730> know

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:05.880 
party system Al Gore right you know

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:07.670 
party system Al Gore right you know
George<00:04:06.239> Bush<00:04:06.329> like<00:04:06.870> that<00:04:07.140> is<00:04:07.380> those<00:04:07.650> are

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:07.680 
George Bush like that is those are

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:10.640 
George Bush like that is those are
things<00:04:08.010> that<00:04:08.070> arguably<00:04:08.959> lost<00:04:09.959> the<00:04:10.170> election

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:10.650 
things that arguably lost the election

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:12.199 
things that arguably lost the election
any<00:04:11.070> other<00:04:11.280> decisions<00:04:11.760> could<00:04:11.880> have<00:04:11.970> been<00:04:12.060> made

00:04:12.199 --> 00:04:12.209 
any other decisions could have been made

00:04:12.209 --> 00:04:14.300 
any other decisions could have been made
but<00:04:12.390> largely<00:04:12.780> you<00:04:13.410> know<00:04:13.440> lost<00:04:13.859> the<00:04:13.980> election

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:14.310 
but largely you know lost the election

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:15.650 
but largely you know lost the election
for<00:04:14.489> the<00:04:14.519> person<00:04:14.910> who<00:04:15.000> was<00:04:15.150> closing<00:04:15.390> on<00:04:15.570> the

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:15.660 
for the person who was closing on the

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:17.060 
for the person who was closing on the
political<00:04:15.810> spectrum<00:04:16.169> to<00:04:16.500> the<00:04:16.530> billionaire

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:17.070 
political spectrum to the billionaire

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:19.219 
political spectrum to the billionaire
who<00:04:17.220> ran<00:04:17.459> yeah<00:04:17.789> or<00:04:18.120> the<00:04:18.359> large<00:04:18.600> third<00:04:18.989> party

00:06:39.089 --> 00:06:39.099 
of this is just the ridiculous amount of

00:06:39.099 --> 00:06:41.189

00:06:42.510 --> 00:06:42.520 
presented this question three times but

00:06:42.520 --> 00:06:44.369 
presented this question three times but
the<00:06:42.639> idea<00:06:42.940> even<00:06:43.150> how<00:06:43.300> silly<00:06:43.659> it<00:06:43.810> is<00:06:43.900> that<00:06:44.110> you

00:06:44.369 --> 00:06:44.379 
the idea even how silly it is that you

00:06:44.379 --> 00:06:45.749 
the idea even how silly it is that you
need<00:06:44.530> a<00:06:44.560> billionaire<00:06:45.159> to<00:06:45.310> come<00:06:45.460> in<00:06:45.580> so<00:06:45.729> that

00:06:45.749 --> 00:06:45.759 
need a billionaire to come in so that

00:06:45.759 --> 00:06:47.279 
need a billionaire to come in so that
the<00:06:45.909> money<00:06:46.060> could<00:06:46.599> get<00:06:46.750> out<00:06:46.900> is<00:06:47.020> there<00:06:47.139> any

00:06:47.279 --> 00:06:47.289 
the money could get out is there any

00:06:47.289 --> 00:06:48.869 
the money could get out is there any
chance<00:06:47.590> that<00:06:47.710> the<00:06:48.009> system<00:06:48.340> will<00:06:48.460> ever<00:06:48.639> change

00:06:48.869 --> 00:06:48.879 
chance that the system will ever change

00:06:48.879 --> 00:06:53.659 
chance that the system will ever change
no<00:06:49.270> no<00:06:50.340> no<00:06:51.340> I<00:06:51.400> do<00:06:51.909> I<00:06:52.330> actually<00:06:52.569> think<00:06:53.020> this<00:06:53.409> is

00:06:53.659 --> 00:06:53.669 
no no no I do I actually think this is

00:06:53.669 --> 00:06:56.999 
no no no I do I actually think this is
elevating<00:06:54.669> the<00:06:54.909> conversation<00:06:55.599> so<00:06:56.009> maybe

00:06:56.999 --> 00:06:57.009 
elevating the conversation so maybe

00:06:57.009 --> 00:06:59.939 
elevating the conversation so maybe
because<00:06:57.659> democracy<00:06:58.659> doesn't<00:06:59.050> work<00:06:59.199> right<00:06:59.740> now

00:06:59.939 --> 00:06:59.949 
because democracy doesn't work right now
