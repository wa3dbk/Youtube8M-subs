yourself an experiment you know what are

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:54.049 
yourself an experiment you know what are
the<00:00:52.590> reasons<00:00:52.739> that<00:00:52.980> the<00:00:53.129> class<00:00:53.309> worked<00:00:53.670> so

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
the reasons that the class worked so

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:56.240 
the reasons that the class worked so
well<00:00:54.239> is<00:00:54.539> that<00:00:54.960> you<00:00:55.199> can't<00:00:55.410> see<00:00:55.800> anybody

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
well is that you can't see anybody

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:58.670 
well is that you can't see anybody
else's<00:00:56.730> work<00:00:57.000> during<00:00:57.510> class<00:00:57.870> since<00:00:58.469> we're<00:00:58.649> on

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
else's work during class since we're on

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:00.889 
else's work during class since we're on
the<00:00:58.739> phone<00:00:59.070> so<00:00:59.969> you<00:01:00.000> can't<00:01:00.359> compare<00:01:00.840> yourself

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899 
the phone so you can't compare yourself

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:03.380 
the phone so you can't compare yourself
to<00:01:01.410> other<00:01:01.649> people<00:01:01.739> and<00:01:02.430> decide<00:01:03.090> that<00:01:03.270> you

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
to other people and decide that you

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:06.580 
to other people and decide that you
don't<00:01:03.510> measure<00:01:03.719> up<00:01:04.250> this<00:01:05.250> is<00:01:05.489> huge<00:01:05.970> because

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:06.590 
don't measure up this is huge because

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:09.070 
don't measure up this is huge because
interrupting<00:01:07.590> this<00:01:07.799> negative<00:01:08.310> pattern<00:01:08.640> alone

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:09.080 
interrupting this negative pattern alone

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:11.030 
interrupting this negative pattern alone
will<00:01:10.080> really<00:01:10.380> increase<00:01:10.650> your

community but complete privacy at the
same<00:01:28.799> time<00:01:29.240> this<00:01:30.240> makes<00:01:30.540> it<00:01:30.689> so<00:01:31.020> much<00:01:31.350> easier

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:31.590 
same time this makes it so much easier

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:34.789 
same time this makes it so much easier
to<00:01:32.159> take<00:01:32.400> artistic<00:01:32.729> risks<00:01:33.450> try<00:01:34.200> something<00:01:34.590> new

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:34.799 
to take artistic risks try something new

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:37.399 
to take artistic risks try something new
or<00:01:35.250> even<00:01:35.850> just<00:01:35.970> get<00:01:36.240> started<00:01:36.900> again<00:01:36.990> if<00:01:37.290> you're

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:37.409 
or even just get started again if you're

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:39.910 
or even just get started again if you're
feeling<00:01:37.590> rusty<00:01:38.189> or<00:01:38.369> shy<00:01:38.670> about<00:01:38.880> your<00:01:39.150> skills

00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:39.920 
feeling rusty or shy about your skills

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:42.140 
feeling rusty or shy about your skills
so<00:01:40.920> that<00:01:40.950> might<00:01:41.250> mean<00:01:41.400> you<00:01:41.460> come<00:01:41.759> to<00:01:41.880> class<00:01:42.119> and

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
make something fabulous it also might

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:46.340 
make something fabulous it also might
mean<00:01:44.909> you<00:01:45.000> come<00:01:45.149> to<00:01:45.270> class<00:01:45.540> and<00:01:45.570> play<00:01:46.079> an

00:01:53.749 --> 00:01:53.759 
being creative you're connecting to this

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:56.840
