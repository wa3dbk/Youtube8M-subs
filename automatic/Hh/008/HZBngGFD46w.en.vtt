00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:30.190 
different variations the big one that we

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:32.280 
different variations the big one that we
modeled<00:02:30.580> this<00:02:30.670> series<00:02:31.000> off<00:02:31.150> of<00:02:31.330> was<00:02:31.480> his<00:02:31.870> movie

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:36.160 
so we took a Sigma L jumpsuit took a

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:38.430 
so we took a Sigma L jumpsuit took a
signature<00:02:36.459> pose<00:02:36.760> with<00:02:37.360> nunchucks<00:02:37.900> his

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:45.630 
essentially in bigger form with some
stylization<00:02:44.110> and<00:02:44.320> I<00:02:44.890> guess<00:02:45.160> we've<00:02:45.370> ground

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:45.640 
stylization and I guess we've ground

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:47.040 
stylization and I guess we've ground
find<00:02:45.850> a<00:02:45.970> different<00:02:46.269> thing<00:02:46.450> that<00:02:46.480> we<00:02:46.720> knew<00:02:46.840> then

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:47.050 
find a different thing that we knew then
