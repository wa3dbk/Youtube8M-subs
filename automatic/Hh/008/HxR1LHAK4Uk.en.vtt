00:02:57.809 --> 00:02:57.819 
like it's supposed to be hearts with

00:02:57.819 --> 00:03:01.589 
like it's supposed to be hearts with
headphones<00:02:58.269> and<00:03:00.120> it's<00:03:01.120> got<00:03:01.329> three<00:03:01.569> different

00:03:01.589 --> 00:03:01.599

colors<00:03:02.019> on<00:03:02.349> it<00:03:02.379> but<00:03:03.510> my<00:03:04.510> mom<00:03:04.690> doesn't<00:03:04.930> think

00:03:05.009 --> 00:03:05.019

00:03:06.479 --> 00:03:06.489 
they look like hearts with headphones I

00:03:06.489 --> 00:03:08.520 
they look like hearts with headphones I
think<00:03:06.819> they<00:03:06.970> do<00:03:07.030> like<00:03:07.810> once<00:03:08.019> you<00:03:08.140> know<00:03:08.260> what<00:03:08.440> it

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:08.530 
think they do like once you know what it

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:13.140 
think they do like once you know what it
is<00:03:08.680> you'll<00:03:08.950> see<00:03:09.489> it<00:03:09.579> but<00:03:09.879> I<00:03:11.760> don't<00:03:12.760> I<00:03:12.879> thought

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:13.150 
is you'll see it but I don't I thought

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:18.840 
is you'll see it but I don't I thought
it<00:03:13.239> was<00:03:13.329> cute<00:03:14.670> and<00:03:16.019> i<00:03:17.019> made<00:03:17.590> this<00:03:17.799> X<00:03:18.069> base<00:03:18.489> one

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:18.850 
it was cute and i made this X base one

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:20.910 
it was cute and i made this X base one
it's<00:03:19.389> got<00:03:19.540> like<00:03:19.750> glitter<00:03:20.049> gold<00:03:20.290> beads<00:03:20.709> and

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:20.920 
it's got like glitter gold beads and

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:27.330 
it's got like glitter gold beads and
then<00:03:20.980> black<00:03:24.540> and<00:03:25.540> I<00:03:25.989> tried<00:03:26.470> to<00:03:26.590> make<00:03:26.769> a<00:03:26.799> pacman

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:27.340 
then black and I tried to make a pacman

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:32.339 
then black and I tried to make a pacman
won<00:03:27.600> but<00:03:28.600> I<00:03:28.630> used<00:03:29.049> oh<00:03:29.849> no<00:03:30.849> the<00:03:31.660> knot<00:03:31.870> came<00:03:32.170> out

00:03:32.339 --> 00:03:32.349 
won but I used oh no the knot came out

00:03:32.349 --> 00:03:36.479 
won but I used oh no the knot came out
on<00:03:32.530> that<00:03:32.680> one<00:03:32.859> I<00:03:34.290> use<00:03:35.290> like<00:03:35.530> black<00:03:35.980> fishing

00:03:36.479 --> 00:03:36.489 
on that one I use like black fishing

00:03:36.489 --> 00:03:40.319 
on that one I use like black fishing
line<00:03:36.670> just<00:03:37.030> to<00:03:37.889> tie<00:03:38.889> the<00:03:39.609> pacman<00:03:40.090> and<00:03:40.269> they

00:03:40.319 --> 00:03:40.329 
line just to tie the pacman and they

00:03:40.329 --> 00:03:42.659 
line just to tie the pacman and they
turned<00:03:40.599> out<00:03:40.720> really<00:03:40.959> nice<00:03:41.200> but<00:03:41.620> once<00:03:41.829> I<00:03:41.980> I<00:03:42.220> made

00:03:42.659 --> 00:03:42.669 
turned out really nice but once I I made

00:03:42.669 --> 00:03:44.970 
turned out really nice but once I I made
it<00:03:42.790> for<00:03:42.940> my<00:03:43.060> cousin<00:03:43.389> but<00:03:43.510> I<00:03:43.780> didn't<00:03:44.709> give<00:03:44.829> it<00:03:44.950> to

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:44.980 
it for my cousin but I didn't give it to

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:46.409 
it for my cousin but I didn't give it to
her<00:03:45.130> yet<00:03:45.280> so<00:03:45.489> i<00:03:45.519> will<00:03:45.880> probably<00:03:46.000> end<00:03:46.299> up

00:03:46.409 --> 00:03:46.419 
her yet so i will probably end up

00:03:46.419 --> 00:03:48.360 
her yet so i will probably end up
remaking<00:03:46.870> it<00:03:47.169> with<00:03:47.200> stretchy<00:03:47.620> string<00:03:48.040> on<00:03:48.160> all

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:48.370 
remaking it with stretchy string on all

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:51.900 
remaking it with stretchy string on all
of<00:03:48.519> it<00:03:48.639> I<00:03:49.829> mean<00:03:50.829> the<00:03:50.950> pac-man<00:03:51.130> look<00:03:51.519> good<00:03:51.730> but

of it I mean the pac-man look good but

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:54.870 
of it I mean the pac-man look good but
then<00:03:52.060> once<00:03:52.269> you<00:03:52.389> like<00:03:52.599> put<00:03:53.290> it<00:03:53.440> into<00:03:54.340> bracelet

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:54.880 
then once you like put it into bracelet

00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:57.710 
then once you like put it into bracelet
form<00:03:55.180> it<00:03:55.450> like<00:03:55.480> looks<00:03:56.470> all<00:03:56.680> weird<00:03:56.709> and

00:03:57.710 --> 00:03:57.720 
form it like looks all weird and

00:03:57.720 --> 00:04:02.849 
form it like looks all weird and
whatever<00:03:58.720> but<00:03:59.049> that's<00:04:00.419> a<00:04:01.419> kind<00:04:02.079> of<00:04:02.200> a<00:04:02.290> fail<00:04:02.590> or

d but this one's my favorite this was
one<00:04:30.500> of<00:04:30.620> the<00:04:30.710> first<00:04:30.950> ones<00:04:31.160> I<00:04:31.250> made<00:04:31.430> it's

00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:31.670 
one of the first ones I made it's

00:04:31.670 --> 00:04:33.670 
one of the first ones I made it's
supposed<00:04:31.940> to<00:04:32.000> be<00:04:32.150> a<00:04:32.180> DNA<00:04:32.630> strand<00:04:32.930> or<00:04:33.260> double

00:04:33.670 --> 00:04:33.680 
supposed to be a DNA strand or double

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:36.390 
supposed to be a DNA strand or double
helix<00:04:34.120> I've<00:04:35.120> been<00:04:35.360> wearing<00:04:35.570> this<00:04:35.750> one<00:04:35.930> lately

00:04:36.390 --> 00:04:36.400 
helix I've been wearing this one lately

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:41.440 
helix I've been wearing this one lately
and<00:04:37.400> I<00:04:37.490> really<00:04:37.730> really<00:04:37.850> like<00:04:38.120> it<00:04:38.440> but<00:04:39.440> um<00:04:40.450> the

00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:41.450 
and I really really like it but um the

00:04:41.450 --> 00:04:42.880 
and I really really like it but um the
red<00:04:41.660> and<00:04:41.840> the<00:04:41.960> green<00:04:42.350> that's<00:04:42.590> in<00:04:42.710> the<00:04:42.800> middle

00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:42.890 
red and the green that's in the middle

00:04:42.890 --> 00:04:45.930 
red and the green that's in the middle
and<00:04:43.190> then<00:04:43.250> the<00:04:43.400> white<00:04:43.580> glows<00:04:43.910> in<00:04:44.060> the<00:04:44.090> dark

00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:45.940 
and then the white glows in the dark

00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:48.340 
and then the white glows in the dark
which<00:04:46.940> is<00:04:47.120> really<00:04:47.360> cool<00:04:47.630> I<00:04:47.840> might<00:04:48.140> end<00:04:48.170> up

00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:48.350 
which is really cool I might end up

00:04:48.350 --> 00:04:50.110 
which is really cool I might end up
making<00:04:48.620> a<00:04:48.680> couple<00:04:48.860> more<00:04:49.100> of<00:04:49.160> these<00:04:49.280> in<00:04:49.550> neon

00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:50.120 
making a couple more of these in neon

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:54.720 
making a couple more of these in neon
and<00:04:50.300> glow<00:04:50.450> in<00:04:50.540> the<00:04:50.600> dark<00:04:50.840> for<00:04:51.110> the<00:04:51.760> yard<00:04:52.760> sale

00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:54.730

what I've been doing bead wise and i'm
going<00:05:03.920> to<00:05:03.980> be<00:05:04.100> posting<00:05:04.250> a<00:05:04.820> resin<00:05:05.300> update<00:05:05.740> or

00:05:06.730 --> 00:05:06.740 
going to be posting a resin update or

00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:09.040 
going to be posting a resin update or
might<00:05:06.980> be<00:05:07.100> in<00:05:07.220> two<00:05:07.460> parts<00:05:07.790> because<00:05:08.780> some<00:05:09.020> of

00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:09.050 
might be in two parts because some of

00:05:17.740 --> 00:05:17.750 
those because I'm kind of running out of

00:05:17.750 --> 00:05:20.230 
those because I'm kind of running out of
resin<00:05:17.990> and<00:05:18.350> I<00:05:18.620> just<00:05:19.280> decided<00:05:19.580> to<00:05:19.820> finish<00:05:19.970> him

00:05:20.230 --> 00:05:20.240 
resin and I just decided to finish him

00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:23.560 
resin and I just decided to finish him
