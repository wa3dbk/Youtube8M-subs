00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:36.730 
USB plug which this picture will explain

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:39.570 
USB plug which this picture will explain
very<00:02:37.030> clearly<00:02:37.410> this<00:02:38.410> is<00:02:38.680> a<00:02:38.740> very<00:02:38.860> very<00:02:39.190> cool

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:39.580 
very clearly this is a very very cool

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:42.540 
very clearly this is a very very cool
idea<00:02:40.060> as<00:02:40.300> you<00:02:40.480> can<00:02:40.660> see<00:02:40.960> each<00:02:41.260> USB<00:02:41.920> plug<00:02:42.220> has<00:02:42.520> a

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:42.550 
idea as you can see each USB plug has a

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:44.070 
idea as you can see each USB plug has a
socket<00:02:43.060> at<00:02:43.240> the<00:02:43.330> back<00:02:43.540> where<00:02:43.840> you<00:02:43.930> can

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:44.080 
socket at the back where you can

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:46.410 
socket at the back where you can
basically<00:02:44.230> daisy<00:02:44.740> chain<00:02:45.160> on<00:02:45.460> additional<00:02:45.970> USB

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:50.140 
again and again and again adding more

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:52.110 
again and again and again adding more
devices<00:02:50.680> into<00:02:50.980> each<00:02:51.130> socket<00:02:51.520> on<00:02:51.790> the<00:02:51.910> back<00:02:52.090> of

devices into each socket on the back of

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:54.870 
devices into each socket on the back of
each<00:02:52.390> plug<00:02:52.800> so<00:02:53.800> it's<00:02:54.010> very<00:02:54.130> very<00:02:54.280> cool<00:02:54.610> and

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:54.880 
each plug so it's very very cool and

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:56.220 
each plug so it's very very cool and
it's<00:02:55.300> one<00:02:55.510> of<00:02:55.540> those<00:02:55.660> it<00:02:55.810> is<00:02:55.930> were<00:02:56.140> you

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:56.230 
it's one of those it is were you

00:02:56.230 --> 00:02:57.450 
it's one of those it is were you
thinking<00:02:56.590> why<00:02:56.830> didn't<00:02:57.130> someone<00:02:57.250> come<00:02:57.430> up

00:02:57.450 --> 00:02:57.460 
thinking why didn't someone come up

00:02:57.460 --> 00:02:58.800 
thinking why didn't someone come up
without<00:02:57.700> before<00:02:58.060> it<00:02:58.240> this<00:02:58.450> would<00:02:58.570> be<00:02:58.600> very

00:02:58.800 --> 00:02:58.810 
without before it this would be very

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:00.840 
without before it this would be very
useful<00:02:58.870> on<00:02:59.470> an<00:02:59.740> ultraportable<00:03:00.130> where<00:03:00.640> you

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:00.850 
useful on an ultraportable where you

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:04.220 
useful on an ultraportable where you

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:10.030 
example anyway you just plug that in

daisy-chained in this way it will be a

going to be used and that would be the

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:25.440 
going to be used and that would be the
critical<00:03:24.070> issue<00:03:24.430> here<00:03:24.760> nevertheless<00:03:25.000> it<00:03:25.330> will

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:25.450 
critical issue here nevertheless it will

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:26.790 
critical issue here nevertheless it will
be<00:03:25.540> nice<00:03:25.720> if<00:03:25.930> something<00:03:26.200> like<00:03:26.380> this<00:03:26.560> was

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:26.800 
be nice if something like this was

be nice if something like this was
available<00:03:27.130> to<00:03:27.310> people<00:03:27.870> better<00:03:28.870> lives<00:03:29.140> and

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:29.320 
available to people better lives and

notebooks<00:03:29.680> are<00:03:29.860> getting<00:03:30.130> better<00:03:30.250> but<00:03:30.640> still

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:31.510 
notebooks are getting better but still

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:33.150 
notebooks are getting better but still
this<00:03:31.960> would<00:03:32.230> be<00:03:32.260> a<00:03:32.410> considerable<00:03:32.830> battery

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:33.160 
this would be a considerable battery

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:35.400 
this would be a considerable battery
drain<00:03:33.490> at<00:03:33.730> the<00:03:33.880> moment<00:03:34.210> still<00:03:34.390> cool<00:03:34.960> idea<00:03:35.200> I'm

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:35.410 
drain at the moment still cool idea I'm

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:37.140 
drain at the moment still cool idea I'm
