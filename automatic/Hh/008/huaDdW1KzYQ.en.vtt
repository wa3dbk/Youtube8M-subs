00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:45.720 
way around the front in the back but

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:47.630 
way around the front in the back but

you're not kind of slant the side part

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:50.810 
you're not kind of slant the side part
so<00:01:47.910> it<00:01:48.060> kind<00:01:48.330> of<00:01:48.360> goes<00:01:48.510> down<00:01:48.720> like<00:01:48.960> that<00:01:49.820> then

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:50.820 
so it kind of goes down like that then

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:53.000
