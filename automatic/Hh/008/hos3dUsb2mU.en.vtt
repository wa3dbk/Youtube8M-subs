00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.210
 yes 

00:00:07.610 --> 00:00:12.860
 This integrates an engine that will be mounted 

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:16.590
 on the same wheel in the back 

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:17.880
 this engine is called brussels and it's not 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:20.519
 have any kind of contact is 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:22.949
 only magnetic and that makes it a 

00:00:20.519 --> 00:00:25.259
 very very efficient vehicle this engine is going 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:27.210
 connected to a computer and the 

00:00:25.259 --> 00:00:29.730
 computer receives all its energy from 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:32.279
 a battery the battery of very high 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:34.140
 capacity then the entire system 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:35.630
 works independent of the mechanic of 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:38.360
 pedaling 

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:40.370
 you can go pedaling and in the moment 

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:41.750
 when you're tired or when you 

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:44.600
 feel that you can not go up for example 

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:46.130
 a hill you can put the system 

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:47.720
 electric that works like a motorcycle 

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:50.120
 has an accelerator tube in the handlebar 

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:51.650
 and it starts to work as if it were a 

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:53.270
 bike you can stop pedaling too 

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:55.580
 putting lear to help him and that 

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:58.250
 It's also going to help you extend 

00:00:55.580 --> 00:01:00.470
 the life of the battery two young 

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:02.570
 Engineers and graduates of the university 

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:05.150
 Latin American lion created the first 

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:06.979
 electric bicycle in mexico a hybrid 

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:10.790
 that fuses the best of both vehicles 

00:01:06.979 --> 00:01:12.470
 the motorcycle and bicycle as a startup 

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:14.720
 we are the only way the only one to be 

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:17.180
 butt in mexico that we manufacture and 

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:18.979
 we design electric vehicles which 

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:20.990
 It gives us quite liked taught Wheel 

00:01:18.979 --> 00:01:23.390
 wheel then we go to a company of 

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:26.200
 high technology and well what better than 

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:26.200
 here in front 

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:33.910
 everything came out of a talk we had 

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:36.790
 in a class we were thinking that 

00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:41.640
 It would be father to make an automotive 

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:41.640
 Mexican but 100% electric 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:47.910
 but it's hard work because the 

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:50.610
 technology is not so easy to create or 

00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:53.670
 either do something from third parties then 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:56.010
 it's practically a long task 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:57.720
 but that practically for us 

00:01:56.010 --> 00:01:59.160
 been very satisfactory today this day 

00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:00.300
 is the eighth prototype this is already the 

00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:01.980
 production prototype from the 

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:04.910
 prototype that will be marketed and if 

00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:04.910
 it gives us great pleasure 

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:11.750
 in Mexico, a study is done annually 

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:13.430
 of mobility and it is put to compete the 

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:16.900
 public transport private transport 

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:20.060
 that is, motorcycles, bicycles 

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:22.130
 for example the meter etc. and in a 

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:24.590
 large percentage of cities won what 

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:26.570
 what is the bicycle and in the other 

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:28.190
 remaining percentage won the motorcycle 

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:30.980
 then the idea is to generate a hybrid 

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:33.470
 that has the capabilities of a 

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:35.180
 bicycle for example that we do not know 

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:38.690
 need plates that is not smart of 

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:40.160
 management and that is agile and the other is that 

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:42.050
 is combined together with the power a 

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:43.310
 motorcycle then we generate a half 

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:45.140
 of transportation that is the most efficient 

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:47.570
 for cities like the one we have 

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:49.400
 today in the country this with the aim of 

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:51.800
 make more efficient the journeys of 

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:54.890
 security elements distributors and 

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:57.890
 particular users with information from
