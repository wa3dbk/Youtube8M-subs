00:00:07.450 --> 00:00:11.900
 in the research centers embrapa solos in partnership with the infraero it implanted 

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:14.010
 a pilot field unit 

00:00:14.010 --> 00:00:17.769
 targino at rio de janeiro international airport 

00:00:17.769 --> 00:00:20.080
 the pilot composting unit 

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:23.909
 using local lawn maintenance insignia 

00:00:23.909 --> 00:00:28.799
 associated with remains of digital carbonization and after facts of votes 

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:31.669
 from this procedure 

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:34.170
 organic fertilizers are produced 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:36.150
 soil conditioners 

00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:38.010
 on substrate 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:41.300
 the project to reuse scrap felts 

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:44.210
 began as several other experiments we had to 

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:47.540
 opportunity to develop this partnership with embrapa 

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:52.570
 and allows us today to have the opportunity to instead discard 

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:56.360
 the appearance retains the maintenance of our green areas in the landfill 

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:57.360
 Restroom 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:01.320
 we can produce a quality organic compound 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:03.970
 that can be applied in the recovery of our areas 

00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:08.200
 degraded programming in the development of new inputs 

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:12.959
 bush for use in agriculture is one of our research priorities 

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:16.100
 these studies may 

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:19.430
 the generation of income from waste of this waste 

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:20.980
 and also decreases 

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:22.700
 the environmental impact 

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:24.649
 that this gesture would use 

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:26.720
 when not reused 

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:30.830
 and also provided agriculture with the most ecologically 

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:33.420
 since these new inputs 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:36.270
 could replace at least part of 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:38.390
 chemical fertilizers 

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:40.830
 grass maintenance fabrics 

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:44.500
 are produced in large quantities in cities 

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:45.729
 these works 

00:01:45.729 --> 00:01:49.209
 usually has landfills 

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:51.140
 even if it is a country 

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:53.000
 in the second case 

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.390
 means a very large pressure 

00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:57.560
 reducing your life 

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:00.560
 the final product generated by the composting process 

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:05.990
 to be marketed in the form of different organic fertilizers 

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:10.399
 the technique combined millenarian knowledge about composting waste 

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:11.899
 organic 

00:02:11.899 --> 00:02:13.830
 with new knowledge 

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:16.159
 which take into account the activity 

00:02:16.159 --> 00:02:19.159
 and the use of charcoal 

00:02:19.159 --> 00:02:21.389
 off this answer 

00:02:21.389 --> 00:02:24.739
 try composting here in the laboratory are evaluated returned 

00:02:24.739 --> 00:02:27.979
 methodologies for capturing research on the river 

00:02:27.979 --> 00:02:30.999
 a craftsman of the raw materials that we use in the process of 

00:02:30.999 --> 00:02:33.339
 composting the production of substrates 

00:02:33.339 --> 00:02:36.409
 then we have to win that it is for the great struggles of the maintenance of 

00:02:36.409 --> 00:02:37.289
 lawns 

00:02:37.289 --> 00:02:41.009
 the film stay with coal woman that obesity capture cost 

00:02:41.929 --> 00:02:44.979
 and a smaller share which is a residue of the natural phosphate station 

00:02:46.059 --> 00:02:47.659
 then the composting process 

00:02:47.659 --> 00:02:51.729
 it is perfect and promiscuities basically diverge the content 

00:02:51.729 --> 00:02:54.019
 main subject matter is crime 

00:02:54.019 --> 00:02:55.369
 deep skin 

00:02:55.369 --> 00:02:58.909
 the single car motive that the phosphate communicate pain 

00:02:58.909 --> 00:03:00.879
 good during the composting process 

00:03:00.879 --> 00:03:03.890
 the main thing that never occurred I speak of unification 

00:03:04.499 --> 00:03:07.819
 I was without the formation of a spa passed to the hospital 

00:03:07.819 --> 00:03:10.979
 we have here three steps of a decaying plant material 

00:03:11.959 --> 00:03:14.959
 one is having a breakthrough in the unification process 

00:03:15.779 --> 00:03:19.859
 a way of monitoring the process of indicating this action and neither situation 

00:03:19.859 --> 00:03:22.669
 the subjects produced are federal 

00:03:22.669 --> 00:03:23.829
 so i hope i 

00:03:23.829 --> 00:03:25.709
 an example of the network 

00:03:25.709 --> 00:03:26.989
 is added with 

00:03:26.989 --> 00:03:28.339
 pedro soares 

00:03:28.339 --> 00:03:31.439
 and that showed leftovers during a steel junina feast 

00:03:32.169 --> 00:03:34.869
 that in the real and little forest of the contest 

00:03:34.869 --> 00:03:38.719
 from the material evolution the return of the cassation process 

00:03:38.719 --> 00:03:42.489
 as they are producing a greater amount of material that is level 

00:03:42.489 --> 00:03:46.369
 in this alkaline solution that are humic substances listen south 

00:03:47.329 --> 00:03:50.849
 since the most advanced phase it has a proposal of 

00:03:50.849 --> 00:03:51.729
 unify 

00:03:51.729 --> 00:03:53.679
 Ready to use in agriculture 

00:03:53.679 --> 00:03:56.679
 and I liked the piece with great projection 

00:03:57.209 --> 00:04:00.930
 the organic products obtained by the new process 

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:02.559
 are from below 

00:04:02.559 --> 00:04:04.639
 contaminant hits 

00:04:04.639 --> 00:04:07.349
 to the scientific community 

00:04:07.349 --> 00:04:11.229
 in serious specifications of organic fertilizers 

00:04:11.229 --> 00:04:14.559
 we in this period agripino 

00:04:14.559 --> 00:04:18.639
 besides representing a more appropriate destination for this waste 

00:04:19.279 --> 00:04:23.630
 you only allow to obtain inputs for optimization and dead 

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:24.560
 to participate 

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:26.479
 had already been renewed 

00:04:26.479 --> 00:04:29.749
 this is a strategic issue 

00:04:29.749 --> 00:04:31.870
 according to the study 

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:33.890
 the organic ones in the cities 

00:04:33.890 --> 00:04:36.210
 which has limited in some cases 

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:39.139
 urban agriculture projects 

00:04:39.139 --> 00:04:42.800
 the fertilizer can be distributed in small packages 

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:45.979
 in flower shops of major centers 

00:04:45.979 --> 00:04:49.980
 replacing products marketed as vegetable land 

00:04:49.980 --> 00:04:51.470
 fertilized land 

00:04:51.470 --> 00:04:52.760
 river - from the assault 

00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:54.350
 in the vast majority 

00:04:54.350 --> 00:04:55.499
 if instead 

00:04:55.499 --> 00:04:57.360
 the ministry of agriculture 

00:04:57.360 --> 00:05:00.659
 and which are of questionable quality and origin 

00:05:00.659 --> 00:05:02.289
 besides the infraero 

00:05:02.289 --> 00:05:04.860
 the chick who is also a partner at work
