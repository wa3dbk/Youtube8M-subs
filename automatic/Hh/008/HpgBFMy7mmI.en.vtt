00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:20.930
 you will have so if you want to know this

 new alcatel that here on youtube 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:30.680
 why 

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:36.379
 the first parents 

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:38.480
 one of those our hands this new 

00:00:36.379 --> 00:00:40.640
 alcatel el idol 3 smartphone in this 

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:42.680
 case the 5.5 inch version and good 

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:44.420
 also another version of 4.7 that you have 

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:45.500
 seen the video we're going to leave here and 

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:47.269
 good as we always do the review 

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:48.890
 how are we seeing the design of this 

00:00:47.269 --> 00:00:50.629
 smartphone the front we 

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:53.149
 we found a camera that in this case 

00:00:50.629 --> 00:00:54.710
 it's an 8 megapixel camera worth 

00:00:53.149 --> 00:00:56.420
 I would have implemented a very good camera 

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:57.949
 for the front here we will have 

00:00:56.420 --> 00:01:00.680
 front speaker and the one removed by 

00:00:57.949 --> 00:01:02.059
 it would also be worth a symmetrical design and 

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:04.039
 the buttons on the smartphone would be 

00:01:02.059 --> 00:01:07.090
 inside the screen they would be tactile 

00:01:04.039 --> 00:01:09.770
 and things watching we have android 5.0 

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:11.929
 back and here we have the camera 3 

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:14.360
 megapixels and just below the led flash 

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:16.659
 the logo of idol and below the mark that 

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:18.070
 it would be alcatel one touch 

00:01:16.659 --> 00:01:20.140
 on the right edge we are at 

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:22.659
 raise or lower volume on the edge 

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:25.030
 left we had the micro slot 

00:01:22.659 --> 00:01:26.540
 sim and also the lock button and 

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:28.880
 unlocking 

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:31.970
 upper edge only since 3.5 and 

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:35.620
 Cancel and cancel lower noise 

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:35.620
 microphone and microbus 

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:40.370
 the screen as we have commented that 

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:41.960
 band already 55 inches the truth 

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:43.909
 pretty good that would have a resolution 

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:46.549
 full hd 

00:01:43.909 --> 00:01:48.319
 one thing that I liked and that good 

00:01:46.549 --> 00:01:50.749
 few brands I would simply say that 

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:52.490
 rather it only makes it htc be 

00:01:50.749 --> 00:01:54.229
 assaulted in the front that does not 

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:55.969
 will win the best feeling at the time of 

00:01:54.229 --> 00:01:56.869
 listen to music and good would be a 

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:58.189
 terminal in terms of connectivity 

00:01:56.869 --> 00:02:00.920
 fully equipped not as they have come 

00:01:58.189 --> 00:02:02.719
 practically all all is new 

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:05.420
 generation bluetooth wifi in kind 

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:07.880
 of wifi direct 4g in your processor opts 

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:10.009
 cut to 1.7 gigahertz and this would come 

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:11.810
 accompanied by 2 gb of ram as main 

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:13.430
 difference from his little brother his 

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:15.290
 little brother would have a gb of ram and 

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:17.060
 in this case we are 2 and we 

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:18.829
 we would find in this model also 

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:21.230
 two versions one that would be with you to 

00:02:18.829 --> 00:02:23.090
 unequal ape without the dual sim would have 

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:25.640
 32 gigs of internal storage and the 

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:26.900
 that has only 16 gigabytes and 

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:29.239
 well let's see now some 

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:31.629
 photographs for what is the quality of the 

00:02:29.239 --> 00:02:31.629
 screen 

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:47.120
 it's personal things that we have and 

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:49.250
 good access now to the camera things 

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:51.080
 commented before on the front not 

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:52.400
 we found a very good camera of 8 

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:54.620
 Megapixels with recording capability 

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:55.940
 videos on hd and if we flip it 

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:57.319
 we found the rear camera that in 

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:59.330
 this case is 13 megapixels with 

00:02:57.319 --> 00:03:02.390
 ability to record videos in full hd 

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:04.580
 It would also come with the sony sensor m 

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:06.140
 x 214 and good guys up here the 

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:07.459
 first impressions of this smartphone 

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:09.140
 To be honest, it looks very well 

00:03:07.459 --> 00:03:11.780
 as far as price is good we have it 

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:13.700
 confirmed but will be around 300 

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:15.500
 euros that good below 300 

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:17.930
 euros and well I hope that later 

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:19.549
