00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.179
 hey people welcome to bast 

00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:05.850
 rhomberg I will'm hannes source 

00:00:03.179 --> 00:00:08.010
 today back with the instructions 

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:10.260
 when should i use my pistons actually 

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:11.340
 do with so I want my piste the 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:11.809
 actually do and if so why 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:14.820
 Not 

00:00:11.809 --> 00:00:16.920
 I have moni as a small with it 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:20.100
 the quasi demonstrated like a puzzle 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:21.660
 Look because or like a puzzle 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:25.289
 to look out of 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:28.320
 and that's where we start 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:30.119
 for the piste a corresponding sink 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:31.740
 mobility that means the jump joint must 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:33.410
 be very agile with it we never 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:35.820
 nice to push at a front 

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:37.590
 Second, we need a good body 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:39.120
 short legs for a long time 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:41.489
 upper body will be perfect 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:43.940
 short thigh really horny then 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:46.920
 we have a perfect pass escort 

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:48.930
 then third, of course, we have to 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:50.460
 somehow reasonably in a position 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:52.469
 be a weight on your shoulders 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:54.270
 find normal squat to move what 

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:56.910
 our body weight still and whether 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:01:00.949
 Corresponds because we are at a piste too 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:00.949
 almost half of our body weight 

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:09.299
 and in that we, of course, at 

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:11.700
 Piste sports the knee extremely far behind 

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:16.439
 he will push the front he will kneel 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:19.560
 very squeezed that the meniscus 

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:21.270
 becomes so from 130 degrees he gets the 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:23.640
 Most shear forces and most 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:26.610
 pressure so that means if he has a runway 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:29.100
 since that is exactly the case if I 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:30.350
 do a normal squat and me 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:32.820
 I already have weight overshoes 

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:34.740
 which normal squats and 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:37.680
 I just leave my back 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:40.049
 about as far as the point from here 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:41.579
 now begin to round at the back 

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:44.640
 that means I would become one 

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:46.259
 squat until about here do so 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:47.790
 and you see it now even though I am 

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:50.610
 weightlifting shoes go hurt my 

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:54.600
 Knee just barely comes forward so 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:56.939
 but now I'm piste and now 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:59.909
 Now my leg will be right or mine 

00:01:56.939 --> 00:02:03.780
 knees badly squeezed and you have to 

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:06.500
 meniscus here strong very many powers 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:06.500
 and withstand pressure 

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:15.650
 that is, if somebody is never or never 

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:18.230
 all the realities in the body 

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:20.660
 Constitution on white or a day lays 

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:21.460
 around with deep good squat 

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:25.510
 hinzubekommen 

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:29.180
 then you will with pistols or kneel 

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:30.980
 on short or long I can pretty much 

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:32.690
 I'm sure I would almost say that 

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:34.190
 put my hand in the fire by that 

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:36.530
 your knees are ruined if you do not have someone 

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:38.240
 since the automatically into his depth 

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:43.840
 squat and be yourself in everyday life 

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:46.610
 already in the deep squat on shield 

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:54.830
 shows that we at moni vision like 

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:57.020
 otherwise up to 2 scott body constitution 

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:58.250
 is just that yes that means she has too 

00:02:57.020 --> 00:02:59.270
 a little bit of difficulty is needed 

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:00.580
 a bit under construction and again 

00:02:59.270 --> 00:03:02.989
 get up 

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:05.360
 that can be improved a bit 

00:03:02.989 --> 00:03:07.550
 by taking such a blake and you 

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:08.660
 from the head of the head in front of the breast 

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:16.459
 so that keeps you the center of gravity 

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:18.440
 shift something forward that is you 

00:03:16.459 --> 00:03:20.209
 have seen that knee was beautiful 

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:22.730
 Far ahead they knew each other 

00:03:20.209 --> 00:03:25.310
 proceed accordingly and the the 

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:27.200
 business sport gotten super good 

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:29.630
 it looks very different to me 

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:31.400
 that means june would be 

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:32.600
 tends to be more of a creation 

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:36.350
 to make piste score and also in the 

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:38.660
 to use training because they are easy 

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:40.489
 has a better agility and deep 

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:45.640
 get into the skin and also more often in 

00:03:40.489 --> 00:03:45.640
 the deep squat is when you are a tissue 

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:54.110
 if there is never a fabric in yours now 

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:56.980
 everyday in such a deep or something 

00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:59.930
 burdened as it does in the piste score 

00:03:56.980 --> 00:04:02.150
 Will you be with a pst sport just the 

00:03:59.930 --> 00:04:04.010
 he then quite a lot of weight 

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:06.980
 yes, because your body weight is quasi 

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:09.440
 is overloaded there you will with such a 

00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:11.269
 pistols court relatively fast the tissue 

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:13.579
 just break it because that's it 

00:04:11.269 --> 00:04:14.989
 fabric is not prepared for me 

00:04:13.579 --> 00:04:18.140
 I did not think of one, for example 

00:04:14.989 --> 00:04:19.370
 Just make it so after 

00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:20.209
 Maybe we started somehow 

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:21.380
 just to do sports 

00:04:20.209 --> 00:04:22.729
 and then just a squat too 

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:24.979
 you just do not do that at all 

00:04:22.729 --> 00:04:26.569
 could cope with weight but 

00:04:24.979 --> 00:04:28.610
 you just take the weight out of it 

00:04:26.569 --> 00:04:30.530
 the markets for the sake of God 

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:33.050
 and once her knees on a slide 

00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:34.280
 live animal just like a card house 

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:36.139
 together 

00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:37.550
 would not make the and accurately 

00:04:36.139 --> 00:04:40.280
 With that you would also get the capping 

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:43.970
 to quite a lot else that is 

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:47.060
 make sure that you with the at 

00:04:43.970 --> 00:04:48.560
 pistons you yourself first analyzed 

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:51.500
 I can actually do the piste 

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:53.030
 Should I do it because if you are the one 

00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:54.650
 does not have agility 

00:04:53.030 --> 00:04:55.820
 You need to be in a jump joint 

00:04:54.650 --> 00:04:59.030
 agility then i would work 

00:04:55.820 --> 00:05:01.580
 but very slowly the pistols start 

00:04:59.030 --> 00:05:03.169
 gradually to install or first 

00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:05.000
 make deep squats that yourself 

00:05:03.169 --> 00:05:07.610
 this is the first time tissue-it 

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:08.960
 can adapt and be nourished and there 

00:05:07.610 --> 00:05:12.860
 a corresponding storage 

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:16.699
 so that you take this strong 

00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:18.860
 be prepared for when you like 

00:05:16.699 --> 00:05:20.509
 I have not been this agility 

00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:24.080
 plus that she has a fucking body 

00:05:20.509 --> 00:05:27.050
 constitution for pistols would have been then 

00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:28.340
 it's more like a complete bike 

00:05:27.050 --> 00:05:30.470
 then let be, there are other 

00:05:28.340 --> 00:05:32.240
 exercises the thighs in 

00:05:30.470 --> 00:05:34.099
 train face as horny as now 

00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:35.509
 pistols and there are hardly any 

00:05:34.099 --> 00:05:40.270
 exercise the thigh so horny 

00:05:35.509 --> 00:05:43.250
 train like pistols but as I said 

00:05:40.270 --> 00:05:45.199
 benefit ratio is really shitty at 

00:05:43.250 --> 00:05:46.490
 pistols just for people like me to 

00:05:45.199 --> 00:05:49.130
 short upper body have long legs 

00:05:46.490 --> 00:05:50.539
 have et cetera pp knows the story 

00:05:49.130 --> 00:05:52.430
 that means if you are someone since then 

00:05:50.539 --> 00:05:54.199
 long upper body then has that 

00:05:52.430 --> 00:05:55.969
 whole the whole body 

00:05:54.199 --> 00:05:57.500
 a bit further forward and you can 

00:05:55.969 --> 00:05:58.520
 a little much better in the 

00:05:57.500 --> 00:06:00.710
 his balance down 

00:05:58.520 --> 00:06:02.240
 and if you have the agility 

00:06:00.710 --> 00:06:03.949
 to even squat at all 

00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:06.770
 then you can do that 

00:06:03.949 --> 00:06:08.810
 otherwise only works sometimes with other 

00:06:06.770 --> 00:06:11.389
 forward and looks that they somehow there 

00:06:08.810 --> 00:06:13.699
 get there perhaps is it 

00:06:11.389 --> 00:06:16.699
 happens with my ministry one 

00:06:13.699 --> 00:06:19.550
 meniscus-op because I just from the 

00:06:16.699 --> 00:06:23.120
 deep squat equipped stood up 

00:06:19.550 --> 00:06:24.980
 and I'm not used to being so fit too 

00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:27.810
 do 

00:06:24.980 --> 00:06:31.620
 yes I hope the video was a bit 

00:06:27.810 --> 00:06:33.060
 instructive and helpful for you check 

00:06:31.620 --> 00:06:36.150
 In any case, first your body types 

00:06:33.060 --> 00:06:36.690
 before you want to start pistols drauflos 

00:06:36.150 --> 00:06:39.810
 close 

00:06:36.690 --> 00:06:42.390
 I know exactly the people come in 

00:06:39.810 --> 00:06:43.590
 cross were boxing in the crisp 30 years 

00:06:42.390 --> 00:06:46.170
 I did not do sport I want to marcel 

00:06:43.590 --> 00:06:50.190
 learn rapp snatch and pistons and 

00:06:46.170 --> 00:06:51.060
 kipping collapse next only you will 

00:06:50.190 --> 00:06:51.810
 within the next two months 

00:06:51.060 --> 00:06:54.150
 injured 

00:06:51.810 --> 00:06:56.940
 that means pay attention to it in any case 

00:06:54.150 --> 00:06:59.040
 that is slow and you are here 

00:06:56.940 --> 00:07:01.980
 Slowly into the movement 

00:06:59.040 --> 00:07:04.800
 otherwise my other check-in 

00:07:01.980 --> 00:07:07.050
