00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:24.509 
this is a very sensitive Reed once you

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:26.330 
this is a very sensitive Reed once you
get<00:01:24.840> to<00:01:25.200> where<00:01:25.320> you<00:01:25.530> can<00:01:25.680> make<00:01:25.890> that<00:01:26.070> Reed

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:28.550 
get to where you can make that Reed
break<00:01:26.850> then<00:01:27.540> you<00:01:27.570> can<00:01:27.840> make<00:01:27.990> a<00:01:28.020> variety<00:01:28.350> of

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560 
break then you can make a variety of

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:32.390 
break then you can make a variety of
sounds<00:01:28.860> with<00:01:29.130> the<00:01:29.220> duck<00:01:29.369> caller<00:01:29.630> also<00:01:31.159> if<00:01:32.159> I

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:32.400 
sounds with the duck caller also if I

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:36.109 
sounds with the duck caller also if I
blow<00:01:32.759> on<00:01:32.790> it<00:01:33.000> straight<00:01:33.630> with<00:01:34.590> us<00:01:34.619> with<00:01:35.130> nothing

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119 
blow on it straight with us with nothing

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:41.030 
blow on it straight with us with nothing
covering<00:01:36.570> the<00:01:36.780> insert<00:01:38.869> if<00:01:39.869> I<00:01:40.110> squeeze<00:01:40.530> down

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:41.040 
covering the insert if I squeeze down

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:43.819 
covering the insert if I squeeze down
and<00:01:41.520> cover<00:01:41.970> all<00:01:42.090> cover<00:01:42.810> up<00:01:43.049> that<00:01:43.229> hole<00:01:43.500> on<00:01:43.710> the

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:43.829 
and cover all cover up that hole on the

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:45.800 
and cover all cover up that hole on the
back<00:01:43.979> of<00:01:44.159> that<00:01:44.250> duck<00:01:44.520> call<00:01:44.729> it<00:01:45.210> creates<00:01:45.659> a

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810 
back of that duck call it creates a

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:49.370 
back of that duck call it creates a
higher<00:01:46.110> pitch

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:53.100 

so<00:01:50.460> another<00:01:51.460> sound<00:01:51.880> that<00:01:52.120> the<00:01:52.390> wood<00:01:52.930> duck

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:53.110 
so another sound that the wood duck

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:54.960 
so another sound that the wood duck
makes<00:01:53.350> when<00:01:53.560> he's<00:01:53.680> sitting<00:01:53.890> as<00:01:54.400> you've<00:01:54.790> heard

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:54.970 
makes when he's sitting as you've heard

00:01:54.970 --> 00:01:57.540 
makes when he's sitting as you've heard
is<00:01:55.150> probably<00:01:55.480> the<00:01:55.600> most<00:01:55.750> popular<00:01:56.020> sound<00:01:56.590> the

00:01:57.540 --> 00:01:57.550 
is probably the most popular sound the

00:01:57.550 --> 00:02:01.230 
is probably the most popular sound the
most<00:01:57.760> I<00:01:58.120> would<00:01:58.990> say<00:01:59.460> the<00:02:00.460> one<00:02:00.640> you<00:02:00.850> hear<00:02:01.090> the
