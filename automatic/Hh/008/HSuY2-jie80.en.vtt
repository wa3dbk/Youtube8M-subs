their<00:04:39.720> skulls<00:04:39.990> and<00:04:40.290> stuff<00:04:40.380> I<00:04:40.800> thought<00:04:41.640> it<00:04:41.700> was

00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:41.790 
their skulls and stuff I thought it was

00:04:41.790 --> 00:04:46.100 
their skulls and stuff I thought it was
cool<00:04:42.830> this<00:04:43.830> is<00:04:44.040> just<00:04:44.310> it's<00:04:45.210> actually<00:04:45.660> really

00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:46.110 
cool this is just it's actually really

00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:50.270 
cool this is just it's actually really
smooth<00:04:47.450> but<00:04:48.450> once<00:04:49.050> you<00:04:49.200> start<00:04:49.410> grinding<00:04:49.680> it'll

00:04:50.270 --> 00:04:50.280 
smooth but once you start grinding it'll

00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:55.190 
smooth but once you start grinding it'll
give<00:04:50.460> it<00:04:50.640> like<00:04:51.200> it's<00:04:52.200> like<00:04:52.740> really<00:04:53.370> uh<00:04:53.400> I<00:04:54.200> think

00:04:55.190 --> 00:04:55.200 
give it like it's like really uh I think

00:04:55.200 --> 00:04:58.330 
give it like it's like really uh I think
it<00:04:55.410> would<00:04:55.530> really<00:04:55.860> flying<00:04:56.640> around<00:04:56.910> that<00:04:57.060> much

00:04:58.330 --> 00:04:58.340 
it would really flying around that much

00:04:58.340 --> 00:05:02.719 
it would really flying around that much
yeah<00:05:00.169> these<00:05:01.169> bearings<00:05:01.680> switz<00:05:02.130> been<00:05:02.490> forever
