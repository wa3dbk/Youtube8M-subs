fifty<00:00:49.289> bucks<00:00:49.320> and<00:00:50.180> they<00:00:51.180> didn't<00:00:51.360> come<00:00:51.510> with

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
fifty bucks and they didn't come with

any tags on them you know to say what
size<00:00:54.870> but<00:00:55.110> i<00:00:55.170> try<00:00:55.350> to<00:00:55.410> bond<00:00:55.680> and<00:00:55.829> they<00:00:55.920> fit<00:00:56.190> so

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610 
size but i try to bond and they fit so

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:58.400 
size but i try to bond and they fit so
i'm<00:00:56.910> guessing<00:00:57.090> they're<00:00:57.510> there<00:00:57.960> an<00:00:58.109> extra

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:58.410 
i'm guessing they're there an extra

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:02.479 
i'm guessing they're there an extra
large<00:00:58.649> so<00:00:59.070> because<00:00:59.370> they<00:00:59.489> fit<00:00:59.760> me<00:00:59.789> perfect<00:01:01.489> the

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
large so because they fit me perfect the

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:05.240 
large so because they fit me perfect the
only<00:01:02.670> thing<00:01:02.850> that<00:01:03.000> really<00:01:03.739> it<00:01:04.739> I<00:01:04.979> don't<00:01:05.189> think

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
only thing that really it I don't think

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:08.450 
only thing that really it I don't think
I<00:01:05.640> don't<00:01:06.030> they<00:01:06.600> haven't<00:01:06.960> been<00:01:07.049> used<00:01:07.460> but
