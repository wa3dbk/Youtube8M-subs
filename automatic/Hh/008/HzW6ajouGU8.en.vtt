00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:02.600 
grandma's drapes it's 9 watts it's
actually<00:00:58.710> one<00:00:59.040> single<00:00:59.579> 6l6<00:01:00.149> tube<00:01:00.720> to<00:01:01.620> 12<00:01:01.920> ax7<00:01:02.040> s

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:02.610 
actually one single 6l6 tube to 12 ax7 s

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:04.880 
actually one single 6l6 tube to 12 ax7 s
and<00:01:02.790> it's<00:01:03.450> very<00:01:03.630> simple<00:01:03.989> you've<00:01:04.229> got<00:01:04.409> two

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
and it's very simple you've got two

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:07.280 
and it's very simple you've got two
inputs<00:01:05.309> the<00:01:05.640> hot<00:01:05.940> input<00:01:06.330> and<00:01:06.510> the<00:01:06.630> cool<00:01:06.870> input

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
inputs the hot input and the cool input

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:09.649 
inputs the hot input and the cool input
and<00:01:07.470> you've<00:01:08.040> got<00:01:08.220> two<00:01:08.430> corresponding<00:01:09.180> volumes

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 
and you've got two corresponding volumes

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:12.110 
and you've got two corresponding volumes
so<00:01:09.990> those<00:01:10.229> correspond<00:01:10.860> to<00:01:10.979> the<00:01:11.130> inputs<00:01:11.550> right

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:12.120
