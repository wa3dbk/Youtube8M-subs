00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:26.450 
three platforms as you'll see here and
when<00:00:25.260> you<00:00:25.350> initially<00:00:25.740> pull<00:00:25.920> the<00:00:26.039> boss<00:00:26.189> the

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:26.460 
when you initially pull the boss the

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:28.550 
when you initially pull the boss the
whole<00:00:26.580> room<00:00:26.880> will<00:00:27.029> fill<00:00:27.060> up<00:00:27.330> with<00:00:27.510> gas<00:00:27.810> if<00:00:28.380> you

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:28.560 
whole room will fill up with gas if you

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:30.620 
whole room will fill up with gas if you
stand<00:00:28.800> inside<00:00:29.070> this<00:00:29.250> gas<00:00:29.429> it<00:00:29.789> does<00:00:30.029> do<00:00:30.240> taking

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:30.630 
stand inside this gas it does do taking

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:32.209 
stand inside this gas it does do taking
damage<00:00:30.929> and<00:00:31.140> it<00:00:31.230> will<00:00:31.349> silence<00:00:31.740> you<00:00:31.800> so<00:00:32.070> when

00:00:32.209 --> 00:00:32.219 
damage and it will silence you so when

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:33.260 
damage and it will silence you so when
you're<00:00:32.340> in<00:00:32.430> this<00:00:32.550> gas<00:00:32.730> you're<00:00:32.940> completely

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:33.270 
you're in this gas you're completely

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:34.729 
you're in this gas you're completely
using<00:00:33.570> you're<00:00:33.750> only<00:00:33.899> in<00:00:34.079> this<00:00:34.290> gas<00:00:34.530> when

00:00:34.729 --> 00:00:34.739 
using you're only in this gas when

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:35.690 
using you're only in this gas when
you're<00:00:34.860> running<00:00:34.950> from<00:00:35.130> platform<00:00:35.370> to<00:00:35.579> platform

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:35.700 
you're running from platform to platform

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:37.340 
you're running from platform to platform
anyway<00:00:36.270> so<00:00:36.329> it's<00:00:36.540> nothing<00:00:36.690> really<00:00:36.960> to<00:00:37.170> worry

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.350 
anyway so it's nothing really to worry

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:38.630 
anyway so it's nothing really to worry
about<00:00:37.500> just<00:00:37.860> make<00:00:38.010> sure<00:00:38.129> you<00:00:38.190> don't<00:00:38.340> go<00:00:38.489> in

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640 
about just make sure you don't go in

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:40.639 
about just make sure you don't go in
there<00:00:38.820> with<00:00:38.910> low<00:00:39.090> health<00:00:39.360> now<00:00:39.960> on<00:00:40.140> the<00:00:40.260> pool<00:00:40.469> he

00:00:40.639 --> 00:00:40.649 
there with low health now on the pool he

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:42.770 
there with low health now on the pool he
will<00:00:40.800> move<00:00:41.100> to<00:00:41.309> a<00:00:41.340> random<00:00:41.640> platform<00:00:42.090> and<00:00:42.300> each

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780 
will move to a random platform and each

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:45.170 
will move to a random platform and each
platform<00:00:43.170> gives<00:00:43.770> him<00:00:43.980> individual<00:00:44.670> abilities

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.180 
platform gives him individual abilities

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:46.190 
platform gives him individual abilities
and<00:00:45.420> we'll<00:00:45.510> talk<00:00:45.660> about<00:00:45.780> them<00:00:46.050> individually

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:46.200 
and we'll talk about them individually

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:48.529 
and we'll talk about them individually
but<00:00:46.770> before<00:00:47.070> we<00:00:47.160> get<00:00:47.309> into<00:00:47.370> that<00:00:47.760> we're<00:00:48.420> gonna

00:00:48.529 --> 00:00:48.539 
but before we get into that we're gonna

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:50.029 
but before we get into that we're gonna
talk<00:00:48.750> about<00:00:48.780> an<00:00:49.200> ability<00:00:49.590> there<00:00:49.739> he<00:00:49.860> does

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039 
talk about an ability there he does

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:51.950 
talk about an ability there he does
while<00:00:50.340> he's<00:00:50.489> on<00:00:50.610> every<00:00:50.940> single<00:00:51.270> platform<00:00:51.480> and

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 
while he's on every single platform and

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:54.979 
while he's on every single platform and
this<00:00:52.379> is<00:00:52.530> inhale<00:00:53.010> and<00:00:53.280> exhale<00:00:53.670> now<00:00:53.940> inhale<00:00:54.719> is

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989 
this is inhale and exhale now inhale is

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:56.510 
this is inhale and exhale now inhale is
basically<00:00:55.469> a<00:00:55.590> buff<00:00:55.860> that<00:00:55.890> he<00:00:56.100> gives<00:00:56.309> himself

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.520 
basically a buff that he gives himself

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:58.520 
basically a buff that he gives himself
which<00:00:57.059> stacks<00:00:57.390> up<00:00:57.629> and<00:00:57.840> increases<00:00:58.260> the<00:00:58.350> amount

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
which stacks up and increases the amount

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:00.650 
which stacks up and increases the amount
of<00:00:58.620> damage<00:00:58.980> exhale<00:00:59.399> does<00:00:59.609> by<00:00:59.789> 100%

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
of damage exhale does by 100%

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:02.540 
of damage exhale does by 100%
so<00:01:01.199> basically<00:01:01.530> exhale<00:01:02.039> starts<00:01:02.340> hitting

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
so basically exhale starts hitting

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:04.399 
so basically exhale starts hitting
harder<00:01:02.820> and<00:01:02.910> harder<00:01:03.149> however<00:01:03.480> once<00:01:04.049> inhale

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:04.409 
harder and harder however once inhale

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:06.170 
harder and harder however once inhale
gets<00:01:04.680> the<00:01:04.860> three<00:01:05.129> or<00:01:05.220> more<00:01:05.400> stacks<00:01:05.760> and<00:01:06.000> then

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
gets the three or more stacks and then

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:08.000 
gets the three or more stacks and then
he<00:01:06.270> casts<00:01:06.600> an<00:01:06.689> exhale<00:01:07.049> all<00:01:07.320> the<00:01:07.380> stacks<00:01:07.830> are

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.010 
he casts an exhale all the stacks are

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:09.350 
he casts an exhale all the stacks are
gone<00:01:08.130> so<00:01:08.310> it<00:01:08.369> can<00:01:08.490> never<00:01:08.610> be<00:01:08.820> really<00:01:09.090> above

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
gone so it can never be really above

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:11.120 
gone so it can never be really above
400%<00:01:10.080> more<00:01:10.260> damage<00:01:10.590> or<00:01:10.680> even<00:01:10.770> three<00:01:11.100> hundred

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
400% more damage or even three hundred

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:13.100 
400% more damage or even three hundred
percent<00:01:11.670> so<00:01:11.850> it's<00:01:12.240> nothing<00:01:12.510> really<00:01:12.659> too<00:01:12.930> much

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
percent so it's nothing really too much

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:14.480 
percent so it's nothing really too much
to<00:01:13.170> worry<00:01:13.470> about<00:01:13.680> just<00:01:13.830> be<00:01:14.010> aware<00:01:14.250> that<00:01:14.310> it

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
to worry about just be aware that it

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:15.350 
to worry about just be aware that it
will<00:01:14.640> hurt<00:01:14.850> more

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360 
will hurt more

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:18.140 
will hurt more
now<00:01:15.720> exhale<00:01:16.170> is<00:01:16.560> he<00:01:17.340> was<00:01:17.490> select<00:01:17.729> around<00:01:17.939> and

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:18.150 
now exhale is he was select around and

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:19.520 
now exhale is he was select around and
target<00:01:18.570> and<00:01:18.720> he<00:01:18.960> would<00:01:19.110> have<00:01:19.200> still<00:01:19.350> like<00:01:19.500> a

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
target and he would have still like a

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:21.289 
target and he would have still like a
beam<00:01:19.860> that<00:01:20.130> does<00:01:20.310> a<00:01:20.340> fuck<00:01:20.610> ton<00:01:20.759> of<00:01:20.820> damage<00:01:21.180> and

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:21.299 
beam that does a fuck ton of damage and

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:23.510 
beam that does a fuck ton of damage and
stuns<00:01:21.689> them<00:01:21.960> now<00:01:22.439> if<00:01:22.619> you<00:01:22.710> put<00:01:22.920> someone<00:01:23.130> in<00:01:23.369> the

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
stuns them now if you put someone in the

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:24.649 
stuns them now if you put someone in the
beam<00:01:23.700> like<00:01:23.909> in<00:01:24.030> the<00:01:24.119> middle<00:01:24.330> of<00:01:24.420> the<00:01:24.479> beam

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659 
beam like in the middle of the beam

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:27.050 
beam like in the middle of the beam
between<00:01:25.080> the<00:01:25.500> boss<00:01:25.650> and<00:01:25.920> that<00:01:26.159> player<00:01:26.400> it<00:01:26.820> will

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
between the boss and that player it will

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:29.510 
between the boss and that player it will
remove<00:01:27.420> the<00:01:27.659> stun<00:01:27.960> and<00:01:28.140> that<00:01:29.100> player<00:01:29.340> will

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
remove the stun and that player will

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:31.550 
remove the stun and that player will
then<00:01:29.579> start<00:01:30.000> taking<00:01:30.240> the<00:01:30.990> damage<00:01:31.290> instead

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
then start taking the damage instead

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:34.219 
then start taking the damage instead
it's<00:01:31.920> reduced<00:01:32.340> from<00:01:32.790> the<00:01:32.850> initial<00:01:33.270> damage<00:01:33.450> so

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:34.229 
it's reduced from the initial damage so

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:35.780 
it's reduced from the initial damage so
this<00:01:34.500> is<00:01:34.650> the<00:01:34.740> reason<00:01:34.890> why<00:01:35.189> you<00:01:35.250> might<00:01:35.520> want<00:01:35.549> to

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:35.790 
this is the reason why you might want to

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:38.179 
this is the reason why you might want to
bring<00:01:35.970> two<00:01:36.240> tanks<00:01:36.689> because<00:01:37.140> it<00:01:37.650> does<00:01:37.860> do<00:01:38.070> a<00:01:38.100> lot

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:38.189 
bring two tanks because it does do a lot

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:39.620 
bring two tanks because it does do a lot
of<00:01:38.369> damage<00:01:38.579> and<00:01:38.939> you<00:01:39.000> might<00:01:39.150> have<00:01:39.299> a<00:01:39.360> few

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630 
of damage and you might have a few

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:40.880 
of damage and you might have a few
issues<00:01:39.780> with<00:01:39.990> it<00:01:40.229> if<00:01:40.350> you<00:01:40.439> are<00:01:40.650> having

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890 
issues with it if you are having

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:42.620 
issues with it if you are having
problems<00:01:41.159> with<00:01:41.430> this<00:01:41.610> exhale<00:01:42.060> mechanic<00:01:42.479> then

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:42.630 
problems with this exhale mechanic then

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:44.210 
problems with this exhale mechanic then

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:03.210 
close now as we did mention each

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:04.969 
close now as we did mention each
platform<00:02:03.659> does<00:02:04.049> give<00:02:04.229> other<00:02:04.409> abilities<00:02:04.829> as

and<00:02:08.310> first<00:02:08.729> we're<00:02:08.849> going<00:02:08.940> to<00:02:09.030> talk<00:02:09.119> about<00:02:09.149> the

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:09.450 
and first we're going to talk about the

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:11.540 
and first we're going to talk about the
left<00:02:09.629> platform<00:02:09.929> now<00:02:10.649> on<00:02:10.770> this<00:02:10.920> platform<00:02:11.190> he

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:11.550 
left platform now on this platform he

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:12.260 
left platform now on this platform he
does<00:02:11.700> something

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:12.270 
does something

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:14.990 
does something
attenuation<00:02:12.830> now<00:02:13.830> this<00:02:14.010> just<00:02:14.160> is<00:02:14.460> a<00:02:14.490> channeled

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:15.000 
attenuation now this just is a channeled

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:16.040 
attenuation now this just is a channeled
car<00:02:15.180> so<00:02:15.270> you<00:02:15.330> can't<00:02:15.510> eat<00:02:15.600> rats<00:02:15.780> or<00:02:15.900> anything

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:16.050 
car so you can't eat rats or anything

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:18.140 
car so you can't eat rats or anything
and<00:02:16.470> it<00:02:16.590> lists<00:02:16.800> a<00:02:16.890> spiraling<00:02:17.580> pattern<00:02:18.000> of

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:18.150 
and it lists a spiraling pattern of

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:20.090 
and it lists a spiraling pattern of
sonic<00:02:18.540> rings<00:02:18.870> that<00:02:19.410> deal<00:02:19.560> damage<00:02:19.740> if<00:02:20.010> you

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:20.100 
sonic rings that deal damage if you

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:22.400 
sonic rings that deal damage if you
stand<00:02:20.400> up<00:02:20.610> get<00:02:21.000> hit<00:02:21.240> by<00:02:21.420> one<00:02:21.690> and<00:02:21.930> it<00:02:22.200> doesn't

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:22.410 
stand up get hit by one and it doesn't

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:23.780 
stand up get hit by one and it doesn't
acquire<00:02:22.830> a<00:02:22.890> lot<00:02:23.130> of<00:02:23.190> damage<00:02:23.370> but<00:02:23.610> they're

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:23.790 
acquire a lot of damage but they're

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:25.940 
acquire a lot of damage but they're
really<00:02:24.120> easy<00:02:24.300> to<00:02:24.510> avoid<00:02:24.960> you<00:02:25.470> literally<00:02:25.710> just

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:25.950 
really easy to avoid you literally just

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:28.430 
really easy to avoid you literally just
have<00:02:26.130> to<00:02:26.310> run<00:02:26.520> as<00:02:26.730> loose<00:02:27.150> but<00:02:27.420> it<00:02:27.540> really<00:02:28.290> easy

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:28.440 
have to run as loose but it really easy

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:30.170 
have to run as loose but it really easy
once<00:02:28.800> you<00:02:28.920> do<00:02:29.040> it<00:02:29.190> it's<00:02:29.370> easy<00:02:29.580> to<00:02:29.850> figure<00:02:30.060> out

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:30.180 
once you do it it's easy to figure out

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:32.090 
once you do it it's easy to figure out
and<00:02:30.480> that's<00:02:30.660> the<00:02:30.900> ability<00:02:31.260> that<00:02:31.560> it<00:02:31.650> keeps<00:02:31.830> for

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:32.100 
and that's the ability that it keeps for

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:33.740 
and that's the ability that it keeps for
that<00:02:32.190> platform<00:02:32.490> but<00:02:33.090> once<00:02:33.270> he<00:02:33.390> leaves<00:02:33.510> that

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:33.750 
that platform but once he leaves that

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:36.140 
that platform but once he leaves that
platform<00:02:34.110> he<00:02:34.230> then<00:02:34.380> loses<00:02:34.860> that<00:02:34.980> ability<00:02:35.460> now

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:36.150 
platform he then loses that ability now

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:37.430 
platform he then loses that ability now
on<00:02:36.240> the<00:02:36.330> right<00:02:36.480> platform<00:02:36.720> he'll<00:02:37.110> gain<00:02:37.290> an

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:37.440 
on the right platform he'll gain an

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:39.290 
on the right platform he'll gain an
ability<00:02:37.650> called<00:02:37.950> foursome<00:02:38.430> Verve<00:02:38.700> and<00:02:39.030> this

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:39.300 
ability called foursome Verve and this

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:41.090 
ability called foursome Verve and this
is<00:02:39.420> like<00:02:39.570> a<00:02:39.600> ten<00:02:39.930> second<00:02:40.350> channel<00:02:40.650> cast<00:02:40.860> that

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:41.100 
is like a ten second channel cast that

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:43.340 
is like a ten second channel cast that
does<00:02:41.250> a<00:02:41.280> lot<00:02:42.030> of<00:02:42.330> fucking<00:02:42.660> damage<00:02:43.020> every

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:43.350 
does a lot of fucking damage every

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:46.640 
does a lot of fucking damage every
second<00:02:44.000> however<00:02:45.000> just<00:02:45.690> before<00:02:45.810> he<00:02:46.110> cast<00:02:46.380> this

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:46.650 
second however just before he cast this

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:49.160 
second however just before he cast this
hill<00:02:46.920> he'll<00:02:47.250> like<00:02:47.430> spawn<00:02:48.170> noise-canceling

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:49.170 
hill he'll like spawn noise-canceling

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:51.110 
hill he'll like spawn noise-canceling
zones<00:02:49.440> and<00:02:50.220> if<00:02:50.340> you<00:02:50.430> stand<00:02:50.640> inside<00:02:50.940> them

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:51.120 
zones and if you stand inside them

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:53.990 
zones and if you stand inside them
you'll<00:02:51.270> take<00:02:51.480> 40%<00:02:51.870> less<00:02:52.410> damage<00:02:52.800> from<00:02:53.000> force

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:54.000 
you'll take 40% less damage from force

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.120 
you'll take 40% less damage from force
and<00:02:54.210> Verve<00:02:54.390> however<00:02:55.170> you<00:02:55.380> can<00:02:55.560> only<00:02:55.650> have<00:02:55.980> the

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:56.130 
and Verve however you can only have the

00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:57.530 
and Verve however you can only have the
what<00:02:56.460> you<00:02:56.580> can't<00:02:56.820> have<00:02:56.970> more<00:02:57.150> than<00:02:57.210> four

00:02:57.530 --> 00:02:57.540 
what you can't have more than four

00:02:57.540 --> 00:02:59.090 
what you can't have more than four
people<00:02:57.750> in<00:02:58.020> these<00:02:58.140> zones<00:02:58.350> if<00:02:58.560> you<00:02:58.650> have<00:02:58.800> more

00:02:59.090 --> 00:02:59.100 
people in these zones if you have more

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:00.710 
people in these zones if you have more
than<00:02:59.220> four<00:02:59.430> people<00:02:59.580> in<00:02:59.790> the<00:02:59.880> zones<00:03:00.090> then<00:03:00.360> you

00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:00.720 
than four people in the zones then you

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:02.600 
than four people in the zones then you
don't<00:03:00.930> get<00:03:01.110> the<00:03:01.260> effect<00:03:01.590> from<00:03:01.740> the<00:03:01.830> zones<00:03:02.130> yeah

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:02.610 
don't get the effect from the zones yeah

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:04.430 
don't get the effect from the zones yeah
you<00:03:02.670> do<00:03:02.970> have<00:03:03.090> like<00:03:03.300> 12<00:03:03.630> available<00:03:03.870> slots

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:04.440 
you do have like 12 available slots

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:05.900 
you do have like 12 available slots
because<00:03:04.650> you<00:03:04.770> have<00:03:04.860> three<00:03:05.190> zones<00:03:05.490> and<00:03:05.730> four

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:05.910 
because you have three zones and four

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:07.490 
because you have three zones and four
spots<00:03:06.270> and<00:03:06.510> you<00:03:06.570> only<00:03:06.690> have<00:03:06.840> ten<00:03:07.050> people<00:03:07.230> in

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:07.500 
spots and you only have ten people in

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:09.560 
spots and you only have ten people in
the<00:03:07.590> raid<00:03:07.770> so<00:03:07.820> it's<00:03:08.820> easy<00:03:09.000> enough<00:03:09.180> to<00:03:09.360> do

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:09.570 
the raid so it's easy enough to do

00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:11.210 
the raid so it's easy enough to do
you'll<00:03:09.780> easily<00:03:09.930> figure<00:03:10.320> out<00:03:10.470> these<00:03:10.920> very

00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:11.220 
you'll easily figure out these very

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:12.830 
you'll easily figure out these very
basic<00:03:11.340> four<00:03:11.730> and<00:03:12.000> ultimately<00:03:12.420> if<00:03:12.570> you<00:03:12.630> want<00:03:12.780> to

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:12.840 
basic four and ultimately if you want to

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:14.240 
basic four and ultimately if you want to
play<00:03:12.960> really<00:03:13.170> really<00:03:13.260> safe<00:03:13.650> just<00:03:13.920> have<00:03:14.070> your

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:14.250 
play really really safe just have your

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:16.070 
play really really safe just have your
tank<00:03:14.520> stand<00:03:14.910> out<00:03:15.120> on<00:03:15.270> it<00:03:15.390> and<00:03:15.480> take<00:03:15.720> a<00:03:15.750> hundred

00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:16.080 
tank stand out on it and take a hundred

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:17.240 
tank stand out on it and take a hundred
percent<00:03:16.170> of<00:03:16.470> the<00:03:16.530> damage<00:03:16.830> and<00:03:16.860> just<00:03:17.100> pop<00:03:17.220> a

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:17.250 
percent of the damage and just pop a

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:17.720 
percent of the damage and just pop a
cool-down

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:17.730 
cool-down

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:20.690 
cool-down
yeah<00:03:18.180> if<00:03:18.450> your<00:03:18.630> yeah<00:03:19.590> now<00:03:20.340> on<00:03:20.459> the<00:03:20.550> back

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:20.700 
yeah if your yeah now on the back

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:22.340 
yeah if your yeah now on the back
platform<00:03:20.940> the<00:03:21.420> boss<00:03:21.600> gains<00:03:21.930> the<00:03:22.230> ability

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:22.350 
platform the boss gains the ability

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:24.620 
platform the boss gains the ability
convert<00:03:23.190> this<00:03:23.700> mind<00:03:23.970> controls<00:03:24.300> our<00:03:24.420> player

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:24.630 
convert this mind controls our player

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:26.840 
convert this mind controls our player
and<00:03:24.900> it<00:03:25.770> will<00:03:25.890> only<00:03:25.980> drop<00:03:26.250> the<00:03:26.370> mind<00:03:26.550> control

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:26.850 
and it will only drop the mind control

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:28.010 
and it will only drop the mind control
when<00:03:26.970> you've<00:03:27.090> reduced<00:03:27.270> into<00:03:27.510> fifty<00:03:27.780> percent

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:28.020 
when you've reduced into fifty percent

00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:29.390 
when you've reduced into fifty percent
health<00:03:28.260> now<00:03:28.470> it's<00:03:28.620> very<00:03:28.800> important<00:03:29.220> that<00:03:29.340> you

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:29.400 
health now it's very important that you

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:30.920 
health now it's very important that you
do<00:03:29.520> this<00:03:29.700> quickly<00:03:30.030> because<00:03:30.330> they<00:03:30.660> will<00:03:30.810> be

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:30.930 
do this quickly because they will be

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:33.830 
do this quickly because they will be
slowing<00:03:31.320> and<00:03:31.790> stunning<00:03:32.790> and<00:03:33.150> healing<00:03:33.660> and

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:33.840 
slowing and stunning and healing and

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:35.420 
slowing and stunning and healing and
deep<00:03:34.020> it's<00:03:34.410> just<00:03:34.650> a<00:03:34.709> pain<00:03:34.920> in<00:03:35.040> the<00:03:35.160> arse<00:03:35.310> so

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:35.430 
deep it's just a pain in the arse so

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:38.270 
deep it's just a pain in the arse so
it's<00:03:35.730> a<00:03:35.820> very<00:03:36.030> good<00:03:36.180> idea<00:03:36.510> to<00:03:36.690> do<00:03:37.650> a<00:03:37.680> short<00:03:38.040> turn

00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:38.280 
it's a very good idea to do a short turn

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:40.790 
it's a very good idea to do a short turn
stun<00:03:38.670> on<00:03:38.700> them<00:03:39.000> or<00:03:39.360> any<00:03:39.690> sort<00:03:39.990> of<00:03:40.020> CC<00:03:40.470> like<00:03:40.620> that

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:40.800 
stun on them or any sort of CC like that

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:42.860 
stun on them or any sort of CC like that
and<00:03:40.980> then<00:03:41.400> get<00:03:41.580> them<00:03:41.700> down<00:03:41.850> to<00:03:41.970> 50%<00:03:42.240> health<00:03:42.630> and

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:42.870 
and then get them down to 50% health and

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:45.410 
and then get them down to 50% health and
in<00:03:43.440> order<00:03:43.680> that<00:03:43.709> they<00:03:43.950> don't<00:03:44.160> debuff<00:03:45.060> you<00:03:45.240> like

00:03:49.490 --> 00:03:49.500 
like that if they go crazy so you just

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:51.260 
like that if they go crazy so you just
got<00:03:49.650> to<00:03:49.680> be<00:03:49.830> very<00:03:49.950> careful<00:03:50.220> with<00:03:50.580> that<00:03:50.700> and<00:03:50.910> of

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:51.270 
got to be very careful with that and of

00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:52.670 
got to be very careful with that and of
course<00:03:51.330> don't<00:03:51.660> debuff<00:03:52.080> them<00:03:52.230> too<00:03:52.380> much<00:03:52.530> that

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:52.680 
course don't debuff them too much that

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:54.680 
course don't debuff them too much that
they<00:03:52.830> will<00:03:53.040> die<00:03:53.340> once<00:03:53.970> they<00:03:54.120> come<00:03:54.330> out<00:03:54.480> of<00:03:54.600> the

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:54.690 
they will die once they come out of the

00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:55.940 
they will die once they come out of the
mind<00:03:54.870> control<00:03:55.200> which<00:03:55.350> has<00:03:55.470> happened<00:03:55.680> a<00:03:55.920> couple

00:03:55.940 --> 00:03:55.950 
mind control which has happened a couple

00:03:55.950 --> 00:03:58.430 
mind control which has happened a couple
of<00:03:56.280> times<00:03:56.370> so<00:03:56.760> just<00:03:57.630> be<00:03:57.720> careful<00:03:57.870> of<00:03:58.080> that<00:03:58.110> just

00:03:58.430 --> 00:03:58.440 
of times so just be careful of that just

of<00:05:40.510> buffs<00:05:40.750> which<00:05:41.740> is<00:05:41.919> cool<00:05:42.190> but<00:05:42.340> the<00:05:42.490> really

00:05:42.750 --> 00:05:42.760 
of buffs which is cool but the really

00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:44.370 
of buffs which is cool but the really
cool<00:05:42.880> thing<00:05:43.090> about<00:05:43.180> this<00:05:43.510> phase<00:05:43.750> is<00:05:43.960> that<00:05:44.290> he

00:05:44.370 --> 00:05:44.380 
cool thing about this phase is that he

00:05:44.380 --> 00:05:46.409 
cool thing about this phase is that he
gains<00:05:44.620> each<00:05:44.919> ability<00:05:45.490> from<00:05:45.880> every<00:05:46.210> platform

00:05:46.409 --> 00:05:46.419 
gains each ability from every platform

00:05:46.419 --> 00:05:48.630 
gains each ability from every platform
so<00:05:46.750> because<00:05:47.110> some<00:05:47.260> convert<00:05:47.710> for<00:05:48.220> some<00:05:48.430> Verve

00:05:48.630 --> 00:05:48.640 
so because some convert for some Verve

00:05:48.640 --> 00:05:50.730 
so because some convert for some Verve
and<00:05:48.910> attenuation<00:05:49.479> all<00:05:49.810> in<00:05:49.990> succession<00:05:50.470> of

00:05:50.730 --> 00:05:50.740 
and attenuation all in succession of

00:05:50.740 --> 00:05:53.430 
and attenuation all in succession of
each<00:05:50.890> other<00:05:51.130> and<00:05:51.430> and<00:05:52.180> then<00:05:52.630> you<00:05:52.720> have<00:05:52.870> to<00:05:52.990> so

00:05:53.430 --> 00:05:53.440 
each other and and then you have to so

00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:54.870 
each other and and then you have to so
you've<00:05:53.590> done<00:05:53.770> all<00:05:53.919> three<00:05:54.160> platforms<00:05:54.400> and

00:05:54.870 --> 00:05:54.880 
you've done all three platforms and

00:05:54.880 --> 00:05:56.480 
you've done all three platforms and
you're<00:05:55.000> gonna<00:05:55.120> do<00:05:55.240> them<00:05:55.330> all<00:05:55.450> together<00:05:55.630> and

00:05:56.480 --> 00:05:56.490 
you're gonna do them all together and

00:05:56.490 --> 00:05:58.860 
you're gonna do them all together and
literally<00:05:57.490> you<00:05:57.669> just<00:05:57.700> do<00:05:58.090> them<00:05:58.300> all<00:05:58.540> together

00:05:58.860 --> 00:05:58.870 
literally you just do them all together

00:05:58.870 --> 00:06:00.690 
literally you just do them all together
while<00:05:59.260> nuking<00:05:59.620> the<00:05:59.650> boss<00:05:59.919> it's<00:06:00.220> a<00:06:00.280> good<00:06:00.430> idea

00:06:00.690 --> 00:06:00.700 
while nuking the boss it's a good idea

00:06:00.700 --> 00:06:02.159 
while nuking the boss it's a good idea
here<00:06:00.940> to<00:06:01.120> like<00:06:01.270> stop<00:06:01.479> blood<00:06:01.660> lasting<00:06:02.020> around

00:06:02.159 --> 00:06:02.169 
here to like stop blood lasting around

00:06:02.169 --> 00:06:04.409 
here to like stop blood lasting around
20%<00:06:02.500> when<00:06:03.460> the<00:06:03.580> execute<00:06:03.970> mechanics<00:06:04.300> start

00:06:04.409 --> 00:06:04.419 
20% when the execute mechanics start

00:06:04.419 --> 00:06:05.940 
20% when the execute mechanics start
coming<00:06:04.630> in<00:06:04.750> and<00:06:04.930> so<00:06:05.260> you<00:06:05.350> want<00:06:05.500> to<00:06:05.620> be<00:06:05.740> using

00:06:05.940 --> 00:06:05.950 
coming in and so you want to be using

00:06:05.950 --> 00:06:08.490 
coming in and so you want to be using
stuff<00:06:06.250> like<00:06:06.340> that<00:06:06.550> then<00:06:06.760> but<00:06:07.000> it's<00:06:07.450> this<00:06:08.260> phase

00:06:08.490 --> 00:06:08.500 
stuff like that then but it's this phase

00:06:08.500 --> 00:06:11.159 
stuff like that then but it's this phase
is<00:06:08.710> all<00:06:08.890> about<00:06:09.220> just<00:06:09.460> moving<00:06:10.390> from<00:06:10.720> everything

00:06:11.159 --> 00:06:11.169 
is all about just moving from everything

00:06:11.169 --> 00:06:12.780 
is all about just moving from everything
is<00:06:11.290> amazing<00:06:11.530> I<00:06:11.800> really<00:06:11.950> do<00:06:12.190> like<00:06:12.340> this<00:06:12.460> fight

00:06:12.780 --> 00:06:12.790 
is amazing I really do like this fight

is amazing I really do like this fight
because<00:06:13.030> of<00:06:13.270> this<00:06:13.600> phase<00:06:13.840> one<00:06:14.590> thing<00:06:14.770> to<00:06:14.860> note

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:15.010 
because of this phase one thing to note

00:06:15.010 --> 00:06:16.200 
because of this phase one thing to note
in<00:06:15.160> this<00:06:15.280> phase<00:06:15.550> is<00:06:15.790> that<00:06:15.940> the<00:06:16.060> noise

00:06:16.200 --> 00:06:16.210 
in this phase is that the noise

00:06:16.210 --> 00:06:18.780 
in this phase is that the noise
cancelling<00:06:16.840> zones<00:06:17.050> have<00:06:17.260> spawn<00:06:17.560> if<00:06:18.430> a<00:06:18.580> 10

00:06:18.780 --> 00:06:18.790 
cancelling zones have spawn if a 10

00:06:18.790 --> 00:06:20.190 
cancelling zones have spawn if a 10
uation<00:06:19.030> is<00:06:19.270> happening<00:06:19.600> and<00:06:19.750> these<00:06:19.840> zones<00:06:19.990> are

00:06:20.190 --> 00:06:20.200 
uation is happening and these zones are

00:06:20.200 --> 00:06:21.480 
uation is happening and these zones are
up<00:06:20.350> you<00:06:20.530> standing<00:06:20.919> them<00:06:21.040> you<00:06:21.160> do<00:06:21.340> actually

00:06:21.480 --> 00:06:21.490 
up you standing them you do actually

00:06:21.490 --> 00:06:24.690 
up you standing them you do actually
take<00:06:21.790> less<00:06:22.060> damage<00:06:22.090> from<00:06:22.780> the<00:06:23.550> from<00:06:24.550> the

00:06:24.690 --> 00:06:24.700 
take less damage from the from the

00:06:24.700 --> 00:06:26.550 
take less damage from the from the
spiraling<00:06:25.210> rings<00:06:25.450> as<00:06:25.720> well<00:06:25.900> as<00:06:26.020> taking<00:06:26.260> less

00:06:26.550 --> 00:06:26.560 
spiraling rings as well as taking less

00:06:26.560 --> 00:06:28.380 
spiraling rings as well as taking less
damage<00:06:26.890> from<00:06:27.070> the<00:06:27.190> four<00:06:27.370> suburbs<00:06:27.700> so<00:06:27.970> if<00:06:28.240> you

00:06:28.380 --> 00:06:28.390 
damage from the four suburbs so if you

00:06:28.390 --> 00:06:30.270 
damage from the four suburbs so if you
are<00:06:28.540> really<00:06:28.780> really<00:06:29.050> bad<00:06:29.350> at<00:06:29.650> moving<00:06:30.010> from<00:06:30.190> the

00:06:30.270 --> 00:06:30.280 
are really really bad at moving from the

00:06:30.280 --> 00:06:31.770 
are really really bad at moving from the
spiraling<00:06:30.700> things<00:06:30.940> or<00:06:31.240> if<00:06:31.330> you<00:06:31.419> want<00:06:31.570> to<00:06:31.660> just

00:06:31.770 --> 00:06:31.780 
spiraling things or if you want to just

00:06:31.780 --> 00:06:33.510 
spiraling things or if you want to just
stand<00:06:32.020> there<00:06:32.080> a<00:06:32.200> new<00:06:32.380> can<00:06:32.620> get<00:06:32.770> high<00:06:33.010> wall<00:06:33.250> or

00:06:33.510 --> 00:06:33.520 
stand there a new can get high wall or

00:06:33.520 --> 00:06:35.300 
stand there a new can get high wall or
ranks<00:06:33.910> you<00:06:34.060> can<00:06:34.270> just<00:06:34.510> stand<00:06:34.720> side

00:06:35.300 --> 00:06:35.310 
ranks you can just stand side

00:06:35.310 --> 00:06:37.070 
ranks you can just stand side
yeah<00:06:35.730> it's<00:06:35.910> a<00:06:35.970> very<00:06:36.180> rare<00:06:36.420> situation<00:06:37.050> where

00:06:37.070 --> 00:06:37.080 
yeah it's a very rare situation where

00:06:37.080 --> 00:06:38.540 
yeah it's a very rare situation where
you'll<00:06:37.290> have<00:06:37.470> but<00:06:37.680> you<00:06:37.830> wouldn't<00:06:38.280> really<00:06:38.340> need

00:06:38.540 --> 00:06:38.550 
you'll have but you wouldn't really need

00:06:38.550 --> 00:06:39.920 
you'll have but you wouldn't really need
to<00:06:38.700> do<00:06:38.790> it<00:06:38.880> but<00:06:38.940> that's<00:06:39.090> the<00:06:39.420> little<00:06:39.660> tip<00:06:39.900> that

00:06:39.920 --> 00:06:39.930 
to do it but that's the little tip that

00:06:39.930 --> 00:06:42.020 
to do it but that's the little tip that
you<00:06:40.170> might<00:06:40.260> want<00:06:40.470> to<00:06:40.530> try<00:06:40.740> and<00:06:41.550> dealing<00:06:41.940> with

00:06:42.020 --> 00:06:42.030 
you might want to try and dealing with

00:06:42.030 --> 00:06:43.550 
you might want to try and dealing with
mind<00:06:42.270> control<00:06:42.330> players<00:06:42.870> in<00:06:43.050> this<00:06:43.170> last<00:06:43.380> phase

00:06:43.550 --> 00:06:43.560 
mind control players in this last phase

00:06:43.560 --> 00:06:46.280 
mind control players in this last phase
can<00:06:43.980> be<00:06:44.190> a<00:06:44.220> little<00:06:44.520> bit<00:06:44.760> deadly<00:06:45.180> like<00:06:45.419> we<00:06:45.870> there

00:06:46.280 --> 00:06:46.290 
can be a little bit deadly like we there

00:06:46.290 --> 00:06:47.659 
can be a little bit deadly like we there
are<00:06:46.470> situations<00:06:47.220> where<00:06:47.430> you<00:06:47.460> might

00:06:47.659 --> 00:06:47.669 
are situations where you might

00:06:47.669 --> 00:06:49.370 
are situations where you might
accidentally<00:06:48.330> kill<00:06:48.660> the<00:06:48.810> mind<00:06:49.050> control

00:06:49.370 --> 00:06:49.380 
accidentally kill the mind control

00:06:49.380 --> 00:06:51.230 
accidentally kill the mind control
person<00:06:49.860> and<00:06:50.040> the<00:06:50.400> best<00:06:50.580> way<00:06:50.700> to<00:06:50.730> deal<00:06:51.030> with<00:06:51.060> it

00:06:51.230 --> 00:06:51.240 
person and the best way to deal with it

00:06:51.240 --> 00:06:53.570 
person and the best way to deal with it
is<00:06:51.360> just<00:06:51.600> like<00:06:51.930> slow<00:06:52.530> DPS<00:06:53.100> once<00:06:53.370> you're

00:06:53.570 --> 00:06:53.580 
is just like slow DPS once you're

00:06:53.580 --> 00:06:55.400 
is just like slow DPS once you're
reaching<00:06:53.790> them<00:06:54.150> towards<00:06:54.540> the<00:06:54.690> 50%<00:06:55.260> health

00:06:55.400 --> 00:06:55.410 
reaching them towards the 50% health

00:06:55.410 --> 00:06:56.990 
reaching them towards the 50% health
mark<00:06:55.680> because<00:06:56.040> you<00:06:56.160> don't<00:06:56.310> want<00:06:56.430> to<00:06:56.490> over<00:06:56.790> kill

00:06:59.210 --> 00:06:59.220 
them you know if it if a fire mage gets

them you know if it if a fire mage gets
a<00:06:59.310> dirty<00:06:59.580> pyroblast<00:07:00.060> proc<00:07:00.600> or<00:07:01.169> something<00:07:01.560> like

a dirty pyroblast proc or something like

00:07:01.680 --> 00:07:03.650 
a dirty pyroblast proc or something like
that<00:07:01.740> you<00:07:02.160> can<00:07:02.430> kill<00:07:02.760> people<00:07:03.090> people<00:07:03.120> have

encounter because of that reason but
it's<00:07:07.380> still<00:07:07.680> very<00:07:07.860> important<00:07:08.310> that<00:07:08.430> you<00:07:08.550> do

00:07:08.750 --> 00:07:08.760 
it's still very important that you do

00:07:08.760 --> 00:07:10.370 
it's still very important that you do
get<00:07:09.030> them<00:07:09.210> out<00:07:09.419> of<00:07:09.450> that<00:07:09.870> mind<00:07:10.080> control<00:07:10.140> as

00:07:10.370 --> 00:07:10.380 
get them out of that mind control as

00:07:10.380 --> 00:07:11.659 
get them out of that mind control as
soon<00:07:10.470> as<00:07:10.590> possible<00:07:11.040> especially<00:07:11.460> if<00:07:11.550> they're

00:07:11.659 --> 00:07:11.669 
soon as possible especially if they're

00:07:11.669 --> 00:07:13.610 
soon as possible especially if they're
going<00:07:11.790> to<00:07:11.850> be<00:07:11.970> a<00:07:12.000> bastard<00:07:12.510> to<00:07:12.600> do<00:07:12.720> a<00:07:12.750> raid<00:07:13.290> wide

00:07:13.610 --> 00:07:13.620

00:07:17.030 --> 00:07:17.040 
move from attenuation and force and

00:07:17.040 --> 00:07:18.620
