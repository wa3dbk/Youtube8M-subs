00:00:09.730 --> 00:00:15.549
 community this opportunity is received 

00:00:13.419 --> 00:00:17.680
 carbohydrates are so many 

00:00:15.549 --> 00:00:19.810
 times when they see people who are 

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:22.630
 trying to be a diet to burn the 

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:24.699
 graph the role they have also when 

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:26.830
 analyzed how they were fed 

00:00:24.699 --> 00:00:30.519
 my clients before entering to 

00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:34.239
 311 advice I realized that in 

00:00:30.519 --> 00:00:36.940
 one practically cut with everything and its 

00:00:34.239 --> 00:00:40.000
 food practically consists of 

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:43.930
 chicken fish among other things 

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:45.930
 protein and vegetables nothing more or is already 

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:49.300
 a food let's say it subtly 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:51.609
 nothing delicious and this happens does not 

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:53.859
 think that carbohydrates are harmful 

00:00:51.609 --> 00:00:56.800
 our results in fat burning 

00:00:53.859 --> 00:00:58.960
 but this is true 

00:00:56.800 --> 00:01:02.289
 it depends, I know you've seen people 

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:04.869
 the den of all eat abundant 

00:01:02.289 --> 00:01:08.470
 carbohydrates is not measured or anything and now 

00:01:04.869 --> 00:01:11.050
 yes they have abdominals marked but 

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:13.630
 canines people that we say in some 

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:16.750
 moment and do for some meeting them 

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:19.060
 if you happen to eat a little more of 

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:21.909
 carbohydrates of the usual and realize 

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:25.000
 they start to get a little fat and their 

00:01:21.909 --> 00:01:27.970
 Fat cream stops completely 

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:31.270
 but that is simply because no 

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:33.039
 we all respond in the same way to 

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:34.899
 the carbohydrates to mark 

00:01:33.039 --> 00:01:37.289
 abdominals in less time there are two 

00:01:34.899 --> 00:01:39.369
 effective strategies to carry out 

00:01:37.289 --> 00:01:42.399
 first you need to go decreasing 

00:01:39.369 --> 00:01:45.520
 progressively your carbohydrates 

00:01:42.399 --> 00:01:48.159
 Commits to spend the weeks or months not of 

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:50.470
 a blow you do not need who your day 

00:01:48.159 --> 00:01:53.080
 food is very difficult so 

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:54.819
 remember little by little 

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:56.649
 second I have the form progressively 

00:01:54.819 --> 00:01:59.319
 in which carbohydrates are consumed 

00:01:56.649 --> 00:02:02.770
 be more and more of pablo index 

00:01:59.319 --> 00:02:05.990
 Glycemic for example oat of Puebla on 

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:08.599
 villamar sweet potato beans lentils 

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:11.020
 All kinds of brown rice 

00:02:08.599 --> 00:02:13.970
 to integrate the integral parts 

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:15.760
 orange apples among others because they are 

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:18.830
 winds that help maintain 

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:20.540
 controlled your insulin levels in 

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:23.390
 I change those of high glycemic index 

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:26.660
 for example to whites to be 

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:29.060
 white bread white sodas ice cream drinks 

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:32.090
 sports stands fruit juice 

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:34.610
 processed breakfast cereals these 

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:37.160
 triggers your insulin levels which 

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:40.700
 It is not ideal if you are looking for it 

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:42.380
 fat but that's why you'll see that 

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:44.330
 when the same foods that 

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:46.280
 they contain carbohydrates this is 

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:48.769
 turns our body into glucose 

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:50.840
 which comes to our other king and 

00:02:48.769 --> 00:02:52.880
 blood and that's where it is released to the 

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:55.730
 insulin to bring glucose to 

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:59.330
 our cells the detail is that the 

00:02:55.730 --> 00:03:01.580
 amount of education released varies in 

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:03.230
 people a lot of attention i'm going to 

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:06.230
 put an example so that you understand 

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:07.370
 very well let's say you consume the 

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:09.950
 same amount 

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:12.739
 Take care of your body release the amount 

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:15.650
 necessary insulin to carry 

00:03:12.739 --> 00:03:18.409
 glucose or cells instead my body 

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:21.290
 releases much more amount of influenced 

00:03:18.409 --> 00:03:24.159
 of the necessary that's because you're 

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:27.290
 sensitive to insulin and I am 

00:03:24.159 --> 00:03:29.860
 insulin resistant remembers being 

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:33.290
 sensitive to insulin is good to be 

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:35.209
 Resistant to insulin is bad as you 

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:37.610
 I commented at the time not all 

00:03:35.209 --> 00:03:40.910
 we react the same way to Oscar 

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:43.549
 fly keep in mind the amount of 

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:46.310
 Released insulin is essential 

00:03:43.549 --> 00:03:50.060
 determines the use of glucose and 

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:52.190
 How much fat do you lose or gain now? 

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:54.140
 this video because usually we 

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:56.180
 we go from people with difficulties to 

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:58.970
 Who Martin excess body fat me 

00:03:56.180 --> 00:04:00.670
 they have the toy to the fullest in both 

00:03:58.970 --> 00:04:04.340
 indications I had a moment ago 

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:06.760
 one is to progressively reduce 

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:08.470
 carbohydrates and what is 

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:10.540
 according to is that the carbohydrates that are 

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:13.590
 present in your diet be each 

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:16.690
 more time low glycemic index 

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:20.290
 it only reduces a little more 

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:22.990
 carbohydrates or lean more acids 

00:04:20.290 --> 00:04:25.600
 low glycemic index with accounts 

00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:28.870
 in your current results compared 

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:30.130
 of the previous weeks are minor or 

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:32.470
 be cut to the accounts that your 

00:04:30.130 --> 00:04:34.300
 progresses became a little slower 

00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:35.919
 and although as time goes on 

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:38.139
 you will have less carbohydrates 

00:04:35.919 --> 00:04:40.660
 toning asking present that the 

00:04:38.139 --> 00:04:42.880
 carbohydrates are a source of energy should 

00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:45.250
 demand more and more in 

00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:46.150
 workouts remember if you were 

00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:48.250
 easy 

00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:51.280
 everyone would have abs 

00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:53.440
 marked but it's not like that is next 

00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:56.050
 video we plan to talk more about 

00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:58.360
 this topic that is pretty but while 

00:04:56.050 --> 00:05:00.580
 Get informed as much as possible in the indications 

00:04:58.360 --> 00:05:02.390
 that we have shared with you on the day of 

00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:04.310
