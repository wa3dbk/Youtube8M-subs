00:00:00.430 --> 00:00:02.430
 at 

00:00:23.259 --> 00:00:27.110
 hello everyone that says I hope 

00:00:25.369 --> 00:00:29.810
 that you are well I find you in 

00:00:27.110 --> 00:00:31.610
 yoda company the water the everybody 

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:34.100
 and so we will introduce you today 

00:00:31.610 --> 00:00:36.379
 our analysis of the latest trailer that is 

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:38.480
 taken out on the reef so new space 

00:00:36.379 --> 00:00:40.610
 social all a bib that together 

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:42.739
 we had already done that for the release of 

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:44.269
 previous trailer that we had a lot 

00:00:42.739 --> 00:00:45.739
 more so we thought we were going 

00:00:44.269 --> 00:00:47.030
 start again with his thirteen bercy 

00:00:45.739 --> 00:00:48.410
 this is especially true there is really 

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:49.699
 it does not last very long but 

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:51.289
 really a lot of info to remember so 

00:00:49.699 --> 00:00:52.699
 you will see that with us so it's 

00:00:51.289 --> 00:00:54.969
 party we continue for the rest of this 

00:00:52.699 --> 00:00:54.969
 ryder 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:02.430
 so here we are so we meet again 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:04.440
 you've seen a first glimpse of 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:05.820
 social space lasts here so a space 

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:07.500
 social apparently one would rather be in 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:08.670
 a small paycheck vessel so 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:09.990
 I think it will be much smaller 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:11.790
 that tower with one of the bodies when 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:13.170
 even dark enough is a very character 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:14.640
 important the ten unjust at the end of this 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:15.960
 little video passage we see there we go there 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:17.130
 come back later in the video 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:19.080
 because I believe that at the end of 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:20.250
 trailer on review again this 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:21.869
 character so it's really a 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:23.460
 character who is going to be key who true 

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:25.860
 that he is going to be a little bit central I 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:27.750
 think about this new social space 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:29.399
 in any case at the structural level I 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:31.290
 think that already we are really sure the 

00:01:29.399 --> 00:01:34.850
 ship with a lot of emptiness around that 

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:34.850
 salivate a new place to visit 

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:40.880
 and so we continue with the new 

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:42.950
 characters who will do their 

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:44.750
 appearance on this new social space 

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:46.340
 so the first screen that we can 

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:48.020
 to show you this is this one we see 

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:49.880
 clearly it is waste so 

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:50.990
 here you can see a vandal and I 

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:53.210
 think it will be a new 

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:55.250
 character so maybe a brigadier 

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:56.360
 of a certain factions in any case we 

00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:57.680
 does not have any more info which is sure 

00:01:56.360 --> 00:01:59.270
 we will be dealing with 

00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:01.670
 vandals for new characters 

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:03.229
 on the tower here is a second character 

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:04.340
 really important with the function 

00:02:03.229 --> 00:02:05.180
 frankly that I'm waiting but 

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:06.830
 very much 

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:09.200
 so the osiris faction then there 

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:10.610
 really the decor via gold all 

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:12.830
 simply with candles around that 

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:14.209
 religious fact almost sectarian or at a 

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:15.590
 character with this hood tafin 

00:02:14.209 --> 00:02:17.840
 frankly so here is the faction 

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:19.070
 of osiris will be present and I think 

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:19.670
 that it's with a really 

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:21.230
 important 

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:23.120
 here they are going to really put it to 

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:24.410
 the third character honor on 

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:26.690
 which I wanted to do a little 

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:28.760
 focus was also his characters 

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:30.350
 which looks a lot like copies 

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:32.360
 on the tower elsewhere we see the decor 

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:34.280
 right behind him that's exactly the 

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:35.510
 same thing as on the tower so I think 

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:37.610
 that there will be plenty of new 

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:40.519
 contracts a new corner on this new 

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:42.019
 social space business to follow 

00:02:40.519 --> 00:02:43.760
 maybe we can find the 

00:02:42.019 --> 00:02:45.380
 same contract as the tower what we 

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:47.420
 would avoid us going back to the tower 

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:48.950
 for those who will be more on the reef 

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:51.260
 oh yes it's really a great idea 

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:53.450
 let's continue with the equipment 

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:55.720
 which will be increased as will the 

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:55.720
 arms 

00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:01.870
 So therefore that's here in this passage there is 

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:03.400
 is really going a lot more of this crime 

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:04.990
 so equipment that we all know 

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:06.790
 so to the big mower it's a 

00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:08.650
 really terrible that we can take it off 

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:11.110
 lanka to the green we also see the helmet 

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:12.550
 of the organist found in the 

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:13.900
 rest of croft has as well as 

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:15.550
 hockey equipment the boots of the 

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:18.370
 titan who have tasted little in the raid of 

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:20.770
 date also have the the jacket of 

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:22.510
 dollar canis here we are so it's clean 

00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:24.070
 or it is simply presage that 

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:25.630
 we will be able to increase our 

00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:27.400
 equipment so how is that 

00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:29.800
 will be able to teams and increase them 

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:31.510
 sorry sorry a tower character via 

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:33.670
 contracts we do not know where 

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:35.020
 I think even better and frankly there 

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:36.760
 it would be really a very good idea 

00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:38.320
 on the part of bungie it would give a 

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:38.860
 little bit involved the fact that there is 

00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:40.990
 no raid 

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:43.060
 this could suggest that the 

00:03:40.990 --> 00:03:45.070
 date raid and on and pta fangs are going 

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:46.270
 to be a little elevated in level this 

00:03:45.070 --> 00:03:49.090
 which means we can find by 

00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:51.610
 example I say that randomly to May by 

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:52.960
 example stop dated at level 34 stops 

00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:54.970
 de croft has for example level 34 

00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:56.470
 also and frankly that would be 

00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:58.420
 really a very very good idea of â€‹â€‹the 

00:03:56.470 --> 00:03:59.890
 buggy part of doing that then the 

00:03:58.420 --> 00:04:01.300
 facts and everything would be explained for example 

00:03:59.890 --> 00:04:03.790
 with this screen where we see clearly 

00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:05.470
 the titan character who wears the full 

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:06.520
 glass cellar equipment so that 

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:08.500
 it's the equipment that people 

00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:10.570
 already have at least those who have a 

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:11.830
 titan character is actually these 

00:04:10.570 --> 00:04:12.970
 people tell me but wait, we're going 

00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:14.380
 redoubt power is again the 

00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:16.120
 equipment nor your mouth I have you 

00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:16.840
 already a lot of reactions on the video 

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:19.000
 of the trailer 

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:20.470
 so in fact I think he's going 

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:22.900
 redoubt and equipment we will be able 

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:24.340
 go up to level 30 4 and that's it 

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:26.620
 obviously involves like them and 

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:28.090
 yoda an increase in the level of 

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:30.160
 glass vault so all this is 

00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:31.900
 joined and finally it seems very 

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:33.250
 logic from that so I think that 

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:34.330
 it's really that's a good 

00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:36.310
 new in fact if we can increase 

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:38.020
 his equipment that it's nice to 

00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:39.400
 against it here it would be already a good 

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:40.840
 new it would leave us a taste of 

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:42.520
 raids a little more complicated to 

00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:43.750
 do and on the other hand so this 

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:45.190
 new game mode that will come up with 

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:47.500
 the prison of the veterans prison in 

00:04:45.190 --> 00:04:49.000
 more frankly I think that mwangi 

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:50.500
 really if we are there is less than 

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:50.740
 it really makes everyone happy 

00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:52.240
 world 

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:53.950
 frankly it's a trailer that already 

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:57.300
 says long so we'll just watch the 

00:04:53.950 --> 00:04:57.300
 end of this little video 

00:05:01.340 --> 00:05:06.060
 and so to finish with this lady 

00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:08.580
 the screen we see very clearly a 

00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:09.990
 damsel who would represent I think 

00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:12.060
 I'm almost sure 

00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:13.860
 now the faction read from the 

00:05:12.060 --> 00:05:15.930
 queen that makes several videos I you 

00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:16.920
 do on this famous faction or I 

00:05:15.930 --> 00:05:18.930
 tell you that I am almost convinced 

00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:21.210
 that she will come back because that's what 

00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:22.830
 next dlc is going around a lot around 

00:05:21.210 --> 00:05:24.870
 the arena that it was a little unfair 

00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:26.310
 than what this faction that this 

00:05:24.870 --> 00:05:29.040
 event to read from the queen had had 

00:05:26.310 --> 00:05:30.210
 place that at the very beginning of the game of destiny 

00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:31.260
 and it's true that it was missing a little 

00:05:30.210 --> 00:05:32.850
 little that there are people who had not had 

00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:34.680
 the time to know and what makes me 

00:05:32.850 --> 00:05:35.190
 really think we will find this 

00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:37.050
 faction 

00:05:35.190 --> 00:05:38.880
 it's just the little badge 

00:05:37.050 --> 00:05:41.520
 that she wears at her torso 

00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:43.350
 so on his kind of shoulder strap and in 

00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:45.390
 this badge is simply the 

00:05:43.350 --> 00:05:47.760
 crown with three peaks that represents 

00:05:45.390 --> 00:05:48.960
 the faction read of the queen so 

00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:50.370
 it was a faction for those who 

00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:52.200
 remember where to climb 

00:05:50.370 --> 00:05:53.730
 esteem of the queen so here I think 

00:05:52.200 --> 00:05:56.220
 that there really is something and 

00:05:53.730 --> 00:05:57.720
 I honestly even think that it will be the 

00:05:56.220 --> 00:05:59.420
 no one will have to see to go 

00:05:57.720 --> 00:06:01.770
 validate the contracts 

00:05:59.420 --> 00:06:03.480
 here we learn another last 

00:06:01.770 --> 00:06:05.490
 thing so what tomorrow night there will be 

00:06:03.480 --> 00:06:08.280
 a live so normally that at 19h at 

00:06:05.490 --> 00:06:10.020
 we on the cheat punk handlebar chain 

00:06:08.280 --> 00:06:12.180
 case they will really present a little 

00:06:10.020 --> 00:06:14.310
 more in-depth of the social space of the 

00:06:12.180 --> 00:06:15.900
 reef so on that there will be the 

00:06:14.310 --> 00:06:17.790
 artistic director during 

00:06:15.900 --> 00:06:19.230
 christopher barrett so we will have the 

00:06:17.790 --> 00:06:20.640
 chance to meet we'll go 

00:06:19.230 --> 00:06:22.890
 visit the good handlebars pen that 

00:06:20.640 --> 00:06:24.330
 in a few days so also having a 

00:06:22.890 --> 00:06:27.180
 guest who will be invited so it's the most 

00:06:24.330 --> 00:06:28.680
 big streamer and seems to me on the 

00:06:27.180 --> 00:06:30.390
 destiny today so that's gotha 

00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:31.950
 'lion' so they are two to many 

00:06:30.390 --> 00:06:33.510
 of spirit but there is him and there is one of 

00:06:31.950 --> 00:06:34.770
 his colleagues in any case here he has 

00:06:33.510 --> 00:06:35.970
 guest guest and I know he's going 

00:06:34.770 --> 00:06:36.960
 be able to ask a lot of questions so 

00:06:35.970 --> 00:06:38.370
 to christopher barrett 

00:06:36.960 --> 00:06:40.230
 so I advise you not to 

00:06:38.370 --> 00:06:42.840
