00:00:01.170 --> 00:00:03.710
 well, now 

00:00:03.710 --> 00:00:06.250
 aproser has edited the paper 

00:00:06.250 --> 00:00:11.539
 keep in mind that it is a work or let's say artisan he can reach 

00:00:11.539 --> 00:00:13.909
 but what to repeat is a couple of times 

00:00:13.909 --> 00:00:17.080
 but the important thing is that with very little time and little 

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:20.909
 for a little bit 

00:00:20.909 --> 00:00:25.929
 work let's say I understand that it would have been to make a milestone 

00:00:25.929 --> 00:00:28.519
 a marker a pull on the l 

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:30.419
 let's send 

00:00:30.419 --> 00:00:32.480
 like cherry on the cake 

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:35.360
 to provide a service in children's 

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:36.380
 ignacio a 

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:38.400
 enough of the entity 

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:39.980
 event to allow 

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:48.050
 if he did not show matches he highlighted pérez i that's why we started to see 

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:49.010
 how it looks 

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:52.010
 what to put more rugged appear visa form 

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:58.300
 that he as experts that as the pulp of paper is being learned and there very 

00:00:58.300 --> 00:00:59.899
 slowly yesterday 

00:00:59.899 --> 00:01:04.439
 That's when I greet in the smoothest way possible to achieve it 

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:05.719
 they raised the moral 

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:08.799
 the complete guide to complete does not just convince 

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:10.950
 in that area 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:14.300
 in this way the meat to marry the couple so much that 

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:20.900
 if only you are giving 

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:22.969
 usually 

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:27.749
 that is if he stuck yes yes yes on the work of defex thrown and the tona 

00:01:27.749 --> 00:01:31.990
 rest to the silver we do not talk about the problem is that it can give 

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:37.780
 with certain percent selection formed to believe that this reality 

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:42.790
 in the case of needing to be seen as a moderate peak and normally 

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:47.149
 depends on the complexity of the layout of the circuit where more care 

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:52.290
 moderate a part of those we know that is that under the smoking whistle 

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:54.150
 with greater intensity 

00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:55.140
 how it was 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:59.030
 speed up a little work but where is the clue to hit with 

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:01.790
 with less intensity 

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:04.710
 and also another worthwhile thing 

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:06.060
 to mention 

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:08.089
 is that 

00:02:08.089 --> 00:02:10.449
 being the effort that must be done 

00:02:10.449 --> 00:02:13.849
 edited to remove the paper to defend the paper 

00:02:13.849 --> 00:02:16.989
 7 million tons that in consideration also 

00:02:17.649 --> 00:02:22.209
 the thickness the width of the track, that is whether tension or to work with very very 

00:02:22.209 --> 00:02:27.159
 fine very small or with clues as it says I read very fine very small we must 

00:02:27.159 --> 00:02:32.009
 give him with a lot of caution very carefully with tranquility at 

00:02:32.009 --> 00:02:33.329
 space 

00:02:33.329 --> 00:02:37.930
 3 500 regarding if we get to all of Japan via thicker as we are in 

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:39.169
 this moment 

00:02:39.169 --> 00:02:42.590
 if we are working with a travel store 

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:45.670
 sneaks in the timely program as 4 1 points 4 

00:02:47.409 --> 00:02:50.869
 is a person that allows us to work comfortably 

00:02:50.869 --> 00:02:53.529
 and there we see how I read 

00:02:53.529 --> 00:02:55.959
 aesthetically withdrawing little by little 

00:02:55.959 --> 00:02:57.509
 paper 

00:02:57.509 --> 00:02:59.599
 ica leaving 

00:02:59.599 --> 00:03:02.239
 what's left 

00:03:02.239 --> 00:03:04.199
 of g 

00:03:04.199 --> 00:03:06.729
 in that sense all in paper 

00:03:06.729 --> 00:03:08.849
 Yes, keep going like this 

00:03:08.849 --> 00:03:09.700
 everyone 

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:11.589
 the accident 

00:03:11.589 --> 00:03:14.629
 that almunia day comes off 

00:03:14.629 --> 00:03:17.189
 a little bit a little 

00:03:17.189 --> 00:03:18.589
 is it possible 

00:03:18.589 --> 00:03:21.589
 solve with a ford with a belt with an indelible marker 

00:03:22.729 --> 00:03:27.459
 to repair the short part of the track if we have ironed well 

00:03:27.459 --> 00:03:29.209
 it should not happen 

00:03:29.209 --> 00:03:33.639
 and he would have to leave as he is taking out half finished them with his hand in 

00:03:33.639 --> 00:03:34.789
 some parts 

00:03:34.789 --> 00:03:38.389
 - We see Rodri Amaya if there is any 

00:03:38.389 --> 00:03:39.439
 He narrated that 

00:03:39.439 --> 00:03:43.809
 that can be solved repeats in another procedure percent also what 

00:03:43.809 --> 00:03:47.329
 we do because it's how fast the subject is of fighters if it were to be 

00:03:47.329 --> 00:03:50.989
 we repeat is raúl ferrero gana takes everything I've done 

00:03:50.989 --> 00:03:53.149
 responsible for not repeating 

00:03:53.149 --> 00:03:55.969
 in that way we avoid 

00:03:55.969 --> 00:03:58.969
 with the summer the demonstrations in places where 

00:03:59.699 --> 00:04:02.179
 It can be complicated to be 

00:04:02.179 --> 00:04:04.589
 it's corruption is zero 

00:04:04.589 --> 00:04:07.699
 and there is adjudged they are seeing as is known 

00:04:09.059 --> 00:04:13.769
 everything goes through the tracks while it will be key to be able to compare them 

00:04:14.709 --> 00:04:17.729
 irak iran 

00:04:17.729 --> 00:04:20.009
 they will notice white together 

00:04:20.009 --> 00:04:22.610
 for example there 

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:26.319
 where you see here was a paper challenge that looks at us although from above 

00:04:26.319 --> 00:04:28.050
 by the bcb 

00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:29.659
 that of putting a plate 

00:04:29.659 --> 00:04:33.300
 to more complex where you have nothing to stop 

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:35.639
 therefore they are experts for which 

00:04:35.639 --> 00:04:36.809
 percent 

00:04:36.809 --> 00:04:42.029
 and everything that can be avoided percent of paper or that would be optimal 

00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:45.639
 and in that way tilting it by turning it 

00:04:45.639 --> 00:04:50.879
 the silver we can work that challenge on the paper that comes from above 

00:04:50.879 --> 00:04:52.940
 know shakira does not serve us 

00:04:52.940 --> 00:04:57.630
 maple can be closed as a hostage was transformed into a press conference in the 

00:04:57.630 --> 00:05:02.040
 lower house the government really does marry nariño it is rare that they stole 

00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:05.220
 an HD camera like the one we are on the other there are no cases is little 

00:05:05.919 --> 00:05:08.669
 why we can also brag 

00:05:08.669 --> 00:05:10.520
 steel 

00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:12.259
 the fact that 

00:05:12.259 --> 00:05:17.969
 It is worth noting that you do not need any kind of paper 

00:05:17.969 --> 00:05:22.479
 special an armed hand greeting let's see what is spoken of paper and 

00:05:22.479 --> 00:05:25.719
 print of hard-to-get papers moved 

00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:30.710
 with a pac with a magazine paper with a sheet from a conventional magazine 

00:05:30.710 --> 00:05:32.979
 with that, notice that it bothered him 

00:05:32.979 --> 00:05:37.969
 we go with politically sound content iii intone that it had started well 

00:05:37.969 --> 00:05:39.449
 past the plate 

00:05:39.449 --> 00:05:41.029
 and we repeat them 

00:05:41.029 --> 00:05:44.569
 all that fundamental thing lolo the most important thing is 

00:05:45.189 --> 00:05:48.520
 lara the possibility that we have to decide 

00:05:48.520 --> 00:05:52.439
 master the tools that jesus vega de sevilla handle 

00:05:52.979 --> 00:05:53.920
 editorial 

00:05:53.920 --> 00:05:57.900
 that would be the iron and that would be the surface where they do a job 

00:05:57.900 --> 00:06:02.150
 look and the quality of that line that line end itaquera in the line of 

00:06:02.150 --> 00:06:04.289
 edge of the plate that we had made 

00:06:04.289 --> 00:06:08.259
 to give the edge of the plate marries note until that cleaning 

00:06:08.259 --> 00:06:11.509
 that has also happened in a positive way 

00:06:11.509 --> 00:06:13.569
 then once it 

00:06:13.569 --> 00:06:15.639
 sacoto 

00:06:15.639 --> 00:06:18.639
 good of Robert usually to ourense with a paper 

00:06:19.319 --> 00:06:22.199
 to avoid oxidation of copper 

00:06:22.199 --> 00:06:26.800
 the positive of past epo has been born later another day 

00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:29.699
 I had to always try to do is not to touch it 

00:06:29.699 --> 00:06:32.180
 I always introduce myself to cambero 

00:06:32.180 --> 00:06:35.470
 orb not to incorporate the grease to for example if it touched 

00:06:36.199 --> 00:06:40.409
 percent is little I do not know garage ocesa waste does not take off 

00:06:40.409 --> 00:06:43.750
 that is to say, he resented the bridge and who has been working 

00:06:43.750 --> 00:06:47.840
 correctly as asado I put to work and analyze the fifth time in 

00:06:47.840 --> 00:06:48.250
 attack 

00:06:48.250 --> 00:06:49.080
 covers them 

00:06:49.080 --> 00:06:51.969
 the copper out there we could close in on the problem 

00:06:51.969 --> 00:06:53.889
 notice and when it dries 

00:06:53.889 --> 00:06:55.499
 how it feels 

00:06:55.499 --> 00:07:00.080
 the on the trace directly as where the whitest track where paper was left 

00:07:00.079 --> 00:07:04.159
 Slim Valdez do not worry about remove from porridge and neither is the important thing 

00:07:04.159 --> 00:07:09.379
 that what happens to us by the PSOE for not allowing us to do a percentage of the 

00:07:09.379 --> 00:07:11.559
 starting only expert with a wick 

00:07:11.559 --> 00:07:14.550
 the shiva mecha 

00:07:14.550 --> 00:07:18.300
 has advanced that occupies the health of the woman is going to sit here goes to work 

00:07:18.300 --> 00:07:20.180
 better the logical pair band 

00:07:20.180 --> 00:07:21.249
 the contest 

00:07:21.249 --> 00:07:24.270
 but look for example the monarch 

00:07:24.270 --> 00:07:27.249
 in which Pablo we have in shock percent 

00:07:27.249 --> 00:07:30.989
 previously all were very well all very well when when a lot is done 

00:07:30.989 --> 00:07:32.389
 pressure with the iron 

00:07:32.389 --> 00:07:37.699
 the tone of how it crushes and without deformations cost and that's where 

00:07:37.699 --> 00:07:39.050
 He met in the pads 

00:07:39.050 --> 00:07:42.909
 has two in the rouge the rouge litogrone passed terminals 

00:07:42.909 --> 00:07:45.509
 of the components 

00:07:45.509 --> 00:07:50.580
 that would be all by the hour and if this is how ironing is done 

00:07:50.580 --> 00:07:53.490
 of the paper on the plate 

00:07:53.490 --> 00:07:57.390
 for the squid we are putting together what we are doing for all of you in 

00:07:57.389 --> 00:07:57.650
