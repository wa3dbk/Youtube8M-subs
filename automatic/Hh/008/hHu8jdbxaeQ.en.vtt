00:01:38.559 --> 00:01:38.569 
but here in America I think a lot of the

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:40.270 
but here in America I think a lot of the
Asian<00:01:39.020> bakeries<00:01:39.530> are<00:01:39.560> trying<00:01:39.859> to<00:01:39.920> save<00:01:40.100> money

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:40.280 
Asian bakeries are trying to save money

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:42.279 
Asian bakeries are trying to save money
so<00:01:40.700> they<00:01:40.909> don't<00:01:41.090> want<00:01:41.539> rice<00:01:41.840> flours<00:01:42.139> more

00:01:42.279 --> 00:01:42.289 
so they don't want rice flours more

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:44.889 
so they don't want rice flours more
expensive<00:01:42.710> in<00:01:42.920> my<00:01:43.100> general<00:01:43.369> so<00:01:43.609> a<00:01:44.270> lot<00:01:44.719> of<00:01:44.749> them

expensive in my general so a lot of them

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:45.819 
expensive in my general so a lot of them
don't<00:01:45.049> want<00:01:45.259> to<00:01:45.319> do<00:01:45.409> that<00:01:45.439> because<00:01:45.679> they're

don't want to do that because they're

00:01:45.829 --> 00:01:47.739 
don't want to do that because they're
