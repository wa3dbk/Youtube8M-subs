00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.069
 diameter about a friend friends with you twins code 

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:06.540
 and today i want to show how to do the same 

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:09.330
 for minecraft and 

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:12.120
 let's start with an ordinary stick 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:14.969
 how does it work and say a few words so 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:17.220
 you'll see we come to the mobs we have them 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:19.890
 killed by one right click 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:23.600
 and what else did I want to say a few words about this 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:23.600
 of this cue can make a system 

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:28.890
 fast dumakov fast-fire 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:29.490
 I think everyone remembers as before the loaf 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:31.710
 minecraft 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:33.809
 older versions so let's show more 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:35.880
 again, but here's the exit besides katomov pressure 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:38.910
 right mouse button and you will see that he 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:41.190
 dying day look these particles it all 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:43.500
 make it very easy so let's kill 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:46.440
 they are still in general a system 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:48.390
 difficult and incomprehensible in general let's 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:49.680
 I will show how it works for archers 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:51.239
 fast generator russia to him 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:54.120
 getting used 2 teams from the block let's 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:56.129
 we analyze in the first part and here in general 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:57.780
 that is, work in cleaning it podbort 

00:00:56.129 --> 00:01:03.239
 will be in the description for a start you need 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:08.040
 will be his while guests together in chat and 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:10.650
 farther like u how everything works when we 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:12.270
 click on the right mouse button us 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:15.479
 given that is to this clip 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:18.840
 one point is added and then she 

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:22.110
 strange 0 and from sitting on the roller scheme 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:29.659
 can be equated to zero 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:32.490
 farther into the ground, that's not the thread 

00:01:29.659 --> 00:01:34.560
 a snowball to teleport some 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:36.960
 Ports oooh yes not replenished here 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:40.229
 this site is pervert which kill and here 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:42.780
 these particles, that is, but this command 

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:45.329
 particles of course the team would be in describing a and 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:48.840
 here is the team itself that mate 

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:52.530
 we did not burn this team she 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:55.380
 kills all all around mobs radius 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:57.790
 15 except players and 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:02:00.040
 next team who soldered particles 

00:01:57.790 --> 00:02:02.830
 fire here these little pieces of fire 

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:06.670
 it's just how are you doing so that it doesn't 

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:10.030
 important and it already said that it is quite 

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:12.370
 aces we particles here only to the very 

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:15.700
 the snowball is that is this command 

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:18.730
 is in this command blocks so this 

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:20.530
 I will say the song again in detail 

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:23.140
 This scheme can be done fast-fire. 

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:25.989
 look on my cat mastered how not to hunt 

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:31.239
 I just have no time to do and I 

00:02:25.989 --> 00:02:35.110
 did that simpler in general i think 

00:02:31.239 --> 00:02:37.209
 it is still and yet it can be called a theme 

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:39.940
 right click to down the scheme 

00:02:37.209 --> 00:02:43.030
 so we for it say goodbye to you 

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:45.190
 will be the code and in general all bye 

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:47.640
 subscribe put huskies and again 

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:47.640
