there's<00:01:04.619> the<00:01:04.799> rear<00:01:05.010> brake

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:10.160 

these<00:01:08.460> things<00:01:08.670> can<00:01:08.880> practically<00:01:09.359> float<00:01:09.869> on

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170 
these things can practically float on

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:12.130 
these things can practically float on
water

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:12.140 
water

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:15.169 
water
yeah<00:01:13.140> float<00:01:13.500> on<00:01:13.649> water<00:01:13.939> that's<00:01:14.939> why<00:01:15.060> these

00:01:15.169 --> 00:01:15.179 
yeah float on water that's why these

00:01:15.179 --> 00:01:17.779 
yeah float on water that's why these
rims<00:01:15.570> look<00:01:15.719> kind<00:01:16.409> of<00:01:16.530> unique<00:01:16.799> because<00:01:17.069> they're

00:01:17.779 --> 00:01:17.789 
rims look kind of unique because they're

00:01:17.789 --> 00:01:21.770 
rims look kind of unique because they're
actually<00:01:18.090> hollow<00:01:18.329> but<00:01:18.750> they're<00:01:18.899> sealed<00:01:20.780> take

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
actually hollow but they're sealed take

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:23.419 
actually hollow but they're sealed take
this<00:01:21.960> cap<00:01:22.200> off<00:01:22.409> here<00:01:22.740> and<00:01:22.829> you<00:01:22.890> can<00:01:23.069> fill<00:01:23.280> them

00:01:23.419 --> 00:01:23.429 
this cap off here and you can fill them

00:01:23.429 --> 00:01:25.039 
this cap off here and you can fill them
up<00:01:23.460> with<00:01:23.520> gas<00:01:23.909> so<00:01:24.450> if<00:01:24.509> you're<00:01:24.630> traveling

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:25.049 
up with gas so if you're traveling

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:27.529 
up with gas so if you're traveling
somewhere<00:01:25.319> really<00:01:25.709> remote<00:01:26.039> you<00:01:27.030> won't<00:01:27.360> run

00:01:27.529 --> 00:01:27.539 
somewhere really remote you won't run

00:01:27.539 --> 00:01:30.230 
somewhere really remote you won't run
out<00:01:27.569> of<00:01:27.719> gas<00:01:27.959> or<00:01:28.610> you'll<00:01:29.610> last<00:01:29.850> a<00:01:30.030> lot<00:01:30.179> longer

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
out of gas or you'll last a lot longer

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:32.120 
out of gas or you'll last a lot longer
because<00:01:30.780> you'll<00:01:30.899> have<00:01:31.049> both<00:01:31.500> the<00:01:31.740> front<00:01:31.979> and

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
because you'll have both the front and

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:32.809 
because you'll have both the front and
back

00:01:32.809 --> 00:01:32.819

don't keep any fuel or anything in the
rims<00:01:39.739> this<00:01:40.739> thing<00:01:40.950> will<00:01:41.130> float<00:01:41.399> if<00:01:41.759> you<00:01:41.909> come

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.060 
rims this thing will float if you come

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:44.630 
rims this thing will float if you come
up<00:01:42.090> to<00:01:42.179> a<00:01:42.329> stream<00:01:42.750> or<00:01:42.989> a<00:01:43.649> river<00:01:44.009> that<00:01:44.429> you<00:01:44.489> have

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 
to cross that's too deep to drive it you

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:48.740 
to cross that's too deep to drive it you
can<00:01:47.310> get<00:01:47.489> off<00:01:47.670> and<00:01:47.939> kind<00:01:48.179> of<00:01:48.270> walk<00:01:48.479> it<00:01:48.659> across

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:48.750 
can get off and kind of walk it across

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:54.199 
can get off and kind of walk it across
the<00:01:50.179> the<00:01:51.229> wheels<00:01:52.229> kind<00:01:52.890> of<00:01:52.979> act<00:01:53.069> buoyant<00:01:53.819> or

00:01:54.199 --> 00:01:54.209 
the the wheels kind of act buoyant or
