00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:17.200 
like about it the key is well using this

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:20.130 
like about it the key is well using this
I<00:02:17.379> can<00:02:17.590> get<00:02:17.739> inside<00:02:18.250> here<00:02:18.849> and<00:02:19.000> just<00:02:19.269> tidy<00:02:19.959> it

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:25.350 
I can get inside here and just tidy it
up<00:02:21.540> and<00:02:22.540> I<00:02:23.140> decided<00:02:23.530> to<00:02:23.739> use<00:02:23.769> brown<00:02:24.360> purely

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:25.360 
up and I decided to use brown purely

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:28.110 
up and I decided to use brown purely
because<00:02:25.680> that<00:02:26.680> was<00:02:26.829> the<00:02:26.980> clay<00:02:27.220> I<00:02:27.250> had<00:02:27.640> open<00:02:28.000> it

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:28.120 
because that was the clay I had open it

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:30.330 
because that was the clay I had open it
at<00:02:28.480> the<00:02:28.720> time<00:02:28.989> and<00:02:29.319> i'll<00:02:29.530> show<00:02:29.799> you<00:02:29.890> what<00:02:30.040> i<00:02:30.099> was

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:30.340 
at the time and i'll show you what i was

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:33.839 
at the time and i'll show you what i was
doing<00:02:30.670> with<00:02:30.819> it<00:02:31.500> when<00:02:32.500> i<00:02:32.530> was<00:02:32.739> inspired<00:02:33.099> to<00:02:33.549> do

00:02:33.839 --> 00:02:33.849 
doing with it when i was inspired to do

00:02:33.849 --> 00:02:38.190 
doing with it when i was inspired to do
this<00:02:33.880> as<00:02:34.829> well<00:02:35.829> while<00:02:36.130> I<00:02:36.160> had<00:02:36.400> the<00:02:36.430> clay<00:02:36.790> out<00:02:37.200> so

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:38.200 
this as well while I had the clay out so

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:39.690 
this as well while I had the clay out so
there's<00:02:38.470> the<00:02:38.620> key<00:02:38.829> I<00:02:38.860> think<00:02:39.250> that's<00:02:39.459> pretty

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:39.700 
there's the key I think that's pretty

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:41.580 
there's the key I think that's pretty
good<00:02:40.000> at<00:02:40.120> it<00:02:40.150> make<00:02:40.390> sure<00:02:40.420> it's<00:02:40.750> nice<00:02:41.019> and<00:02:41.079> flat

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:41.590 
good at it make sure it's nice and flat

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:43.259 
good at it make sure it's nice and flat
on<00:02:41.829> the<00:02:41.950> back<00:02:42.130> it<00:02:42.340> should<00:02:42.489> be<00:02:42.640> fairly<00:02:42.880> flat

00:02:43.259 --> 00:02:43.269 
on the back it should be fairly flat

00:02:43.269 --> 00:02:46.350 
on the back it should be fairly flat
because<00:02:43.510> when<00:02:43.870> I<00:02:43.900> pressed<00:02:44.380> it<00:02:44.590> into<00:02:45.090> the<00:02:46.090> mold

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:46.360 
because when I pressed it into the mold

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:49.890 
because when I pressed it into the mold
when<00:02:46.810> i<00:02:47.500> press<00:02:47.739> the<00:02:47.920> clay<00:02:48.190> into<00:02:48.400> here<00:02:48.910> i<00:02:49.060> used<00:02:49.720> a

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:49.900 
when i press the clay into here i used a

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:51.990 
when i press the clay into here i used a
blade<00:02:50.140> just<00:02:50.620> to<00:02:50.829> slide<00:02:51.190> across<00:02:51.370> the<00:02:51.579> top<00:02:51.970> and

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:52.000 
blade just to slide across the top and

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:55.140 
blade just to slide across the top and
take<00:02:52.359> off<00:02:52.510> any<00:02:52.780> excess<00:02:53.350> clay<00:02:53.739> so<00:02:54.700> they<00:02:54.940> are

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:55.150 
take off any excess clay so they are

00:02:55.150 --> 00:03:02.129 
take off any excess clay so they are
already<00:02:55.569> fairly<00:02:55.930> flat<00:02:56.290> on<00:02:56.530> the<00:02:56.650> back<00:03:01.139> we're

00:03:02.129 --> 00:03:02.139 
already fairly flat on the back we're

00:03:02.139 --> 00:03:04.949 
already fairly flat on the back we're
going<00:03:02.260> to<00:03:02.350> call<00:03:02.620> that<00:03:02.650> done<00:03:03.130> and<00:03:03.780> then<00:03:04.780> what<00:03:04.930> i

00:03:04.949 --> 00:03:04.959 
going to call that done and then what i

00:03:04.959 --> 00:03:08.849 
going to call that done and then what i
thought<00:03:05.350> i<00:03:05.380> would<00:03:05.680> do<00:03:05.920> to<00:03:07.470> make<00:03:08.470> them<00:03:08.650> more

00:03:08.849 --> 00:03:08.859 
thought i would do to make them more

00:03:08.859 --> 00:03:12.569 
thought i would do to make them more
look<00:03:09.100> a<00:03:09.510> bit<00:03:10.510> more<00:03:10.690> aged<00:03:11.049> as<00:03:11.680> i<00:03:12.310> thought<00:03:12.519> i

00:03:12.569 --> 00:03:12.579 
look a bit more aged as i thought i

00:03:12.579 --> 00:03:15.569 
look a bit more aged as i thought i

making them a solid brown color you can

00:05:48.329 --> 00:05:50.689 
making them a solid brown color you can
put<00:05:48.539> a<00:05:48.569> different<00:05:49.379> color<00:05:49.589> inside<00:05:50.099> and<00:05:50.579> then

put a different color inside and then

00:05:50.699 --> 00:05:53.569 
put a different color inside and then
use<00:05:50.909> a<00:05:50.939> cutter<00:05:51.949> to<00:05:52.949> make<00:05:52.979> it<00:05:53.249> look<00:05:53.399> like
