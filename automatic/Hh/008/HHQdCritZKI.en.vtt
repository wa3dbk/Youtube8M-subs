went<00:00:54.660> on<00:00:54.750> the<00:00:54.780> field<00:00:55.140> and<00:00:55.320> he<00:00:55.379> proved<00:00:55.680> it<00:00:55.890> okay

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
certainly better in run defense then

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:01.279 
certainly better in run defense then
against<00:00:59.399> the<00:00:59.460> past<00:00:59.730> but<00:01:00.300> his<00:01:00.510> past<00:01:00.809> defense

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289 
against the past but his past defense

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:04.160 
against the past but his past defense
was<00:01:01.440> so<00:01:01.680> much<00:01:01.890> improved<00:01:02.420> that<00:01:03.420> it<00:01:03.539> landed<00:01:03.960> him

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
was so much improved that it landed him

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:06.289 
was so much improved that it landed him
this<00:01:04.680> big<00:01:04.949> deal<00:01:05.220> with<00:01:05.460> Pittsburgh<00:01:05.939> and<00:01:06.150> the

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:06.299 
this big deal with Pittsburgh and the

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:08.330 
this big deal with Pittsburgh and the

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
probably had the best front seven all

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:12.620 
probably had the best front seven all
right<00:01:10.560> in<00:01:10.710> the<00:01:10.799> NFL<00:01:11.189> last<00:01:11.430> year<00:01:11.670> that<00:01:12.210> helps

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
right in the NFL last year that helps

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:15.469

Mike<00:01:15.750> Mitchell<00:01:15.990> and<00:01:16.350> Captain<00:01:16.770> Munnerlyn<00:01:17.189> how

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 
Mike Mitchell and Captain Munnerlyn how

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:19.820 
Mike Mitchell and Captain Munnerlyn how
much<00:01:17.880> of<00:01:18.060> their<00:01:18.210> success<00:01:18.420> last<00:01:18.930> year<00:01:19.140> was

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830 
much of their success last year was

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:21.800 
much of their success last year was
predicated<00:01:20.220> on<00:01:20.670> the<00:01:21.090> great<00:01:21.330> play<00:01:21.509> of<00:01:21.540> that

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
predicated on the great play of that

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:23.510 
predicated on the great play of that
front<00:01:22.049> seven<00:01:22.439> I<00:01:22.560> think<00:01:23.009> we'll<00:01:23.130> find<00:01:23.369> out

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
front seven I think we'll find out

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:26.030 
front seven I think we'll find out
Mitchell's<00:01:24.000> case<00:01:24.210> next<00:01:24.720> year<00:01:25.049> in<00:01:25.200> Pittsburgh

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
Mitchell's case next year in Pittsburgh

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:27.350 
Mitchell's case next year in Pittsburgh
when<00:01:26.549> I<00:01:26.610> look<00:01:26.759> for<00:01:26.909> a<00:01:26.939> little<00:01:27.090> bit<00:01:27.240> more

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360 
when I look for a little bit more

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:29.420 
when I look for a little bit more
pressure<00:01:27.689> to<00:01:27.810> be<00:01:27.990> on<00:01:28.170> him<00:01:28.439> from<00:01:29.009> a<00:01:29.159> past

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430 
pressure to be on him from a past

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:31.069 
pressure to be on him from a past
covered<00:01:29.850> standpoint<00:01:30.390> then<00:01:30.869> there<00:01:31.049> was

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:31.079 
covered standpoint then there was

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:33.350 
covered standpoint then there was
probably<00:01:31.619> this<00:01:31.799> year<00:01:32.009> in<00:01:32.100> Carolina<00:01:32.610> Mitchell

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360 
probably this year in Carolina Mitchell

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:35.060 
probably this year in Carolina Mitchell
was<00:01:33.479> third<00:01:33.780> on<00:01:33.930> the<00:01:34.049> Panthers<00:01:34.439> and<00:01:34.619> tackles

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070 
was third on the Panthers and tackles

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:37.219 
was third on the Panthers and tackles
this<00:01:35.220> year<00:01:35.490> behind<00:01:35.880> only<00:01:36.240> Thomas<00:01:36.689> Davis<00:01:36.900> and

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229 
this year behind only Thomas Davis and

this year behind only Thomas Davis and
Lou<00:01:37.710> keighley<00:01:38.220> so<00:01:38.579> you're<00:01:38.700> going<00:01:38.820> to<00:01:38.880> get<00:01:38.970> a

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030 
Lou keighley so you're going to get a

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:40.940 
Lou keighley so you're going to get a
productive<00:01:39.509> guy<00:01:39.720> from<00:01:39.990> that<00:01:40.140> angle<00:01:40.350> and<00:01:40.650> he's

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
productive guy from that angle and he's

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:43.340 
productive guy from that angle and he's
an<00:01:41.070> overall<00:01:41.520> tough<00:01:41.909> hard-hitting<00:01:42.780> safety

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:43.350 
an overall tough hard-hitting safety
