the top damage to the outside is sparks

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:41.600 
the top damage to the outside is sparks
a<00:00:37.070> reaction<00:00:38.070> of<00:00:38.510> the<00:00:39.510> cactus<00:00:40.020> putting<00:00:40.530> a<00:00:41.100> type

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:41.610 
a reaction of the cactus putting a type

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:45.740 
a reaction of the cactus putting a type
of<00:00:42.079> scar<00:00:43.079> tissue<00:00:43.730> overrated<00:00:44.730> and<00:00:45.059> therefore

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750 
of scar tissue overrated and therefore

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:48.709 
of scar tissue overrated and therefore
that<00:00:45.930> limits<00:00:46.440> any<00:00:46.910> encroachment<00:00:47.910> by<00:00:47.969> disease

00:00:48.709 --> 00:00:48.719 
that limits any encroachment by disease

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:51.770 
that limits any encroachment by disease
and<00:00:49.489> any<00:00:50.489> other<00:00:50.700> things<00:00:51.149> that<00:00:51.300> might<00:00:51.449> get<00:00:51.660> in

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780 
and any other things that might get in

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:53.869 
and any other things that might get in
there<00:00:51.989> to<00:00:52.920> destroy<00:00:53.250> the<00:00:53.399> inside<00:00:53.699> of<00:00:53.730> the

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879 
there to destroy the inside of the

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:55.220 
there to destroy the inside of the
cactus<00:00:54.239> so<00:00:54.360> they're<00:00:54.510> relatively<00:00:54.930> durable

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230 
cactus so they're relatively durable

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:57.139 
cactus so they're relatively durable
don't<00:00:55.649> forget<00:00:55.949> they've<00:00:56.160> got<00:00:56.370> a<00:00:56.399> they've<00:00:57.000> been

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
don't forget they've got a they've been

00:00:57.149 --> 00:00:58.790 
don't forget they've got a they've been
around<00:00:57.360> for<00:00:57.629> a<00:00:57.660> long<00:00:57.840> time<00:00:57.899> they've<00:00:58.500> got<00:00:58.680> to

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
around for a long time they've got to

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:00.680 
around for a long time they've got to
survive<00:00:58.949> in<00:00:59.340> this<00:00:59.489> terrible<00:00:59.850> climate<00:01:00.359> this

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690 
survive in this terrible climate this

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:02.360 
survive in this terrible climate this
damage<00:01:01.140> that<00:01:01.350> you're<00:01:01.500> seeing<00:01:01.770> here<00:01:02.190> is

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
damage that you're seeing here is

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:05.090 
damage that you're seeing here is
probably<00:01:03.030> damaged<00:01:03.870> from<00:01:04.049> rocks<00:01:04.379> and<00:01:04.710> sticks

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
probably damaged from rocks and sticks

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:08.200 
probably damaged from rocks and sticks
and<00:01:05.700> things<00:01:06.150> poking<00:01:06.450> Adam<00:01:06.900> it<00:01:07.020> is<00:01:07.140> close<00:01:07.380> to<00:01:07.619> a

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:08.210 
and things poking Adam it is close to a

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:11.750 
and things poking Adam it is close to a
well-used<00:01:09.210> trail<00:01:09.869> I<00:01:10.439> see<00:01:11.010> some<00:01:11.310> damage

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760 
well-used trail I see some damage

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:13.609 
well-used trail I see some damage
getting<00:01:12.150> down<00:01:12.360> in<00:01:12.570> here<00:01:12.780> into<00:01:12.990> the<00:01:13.229> rip<00:01:13.409> so

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
getting down in here into the rip so

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:16.670 
getting down in here into the rip so
this<00:01:13.799> cactus<00:01:14.040> might<00:01:14.490> be<00:01:15.290> beginning<00:01:16.290> to<00:01:16.470> see

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
this cactus might be beginning to see

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:19.429 
this cactus might be beginning to see
the<00:01:16.710> the<00:01:17.340> first<00:01:17.610> stages<00:01:17.909> of<00:01:18.439> internal

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:19.439 
the the first stages of internal

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:22.010 
the the first stages of internal
infections<00:01:20.100> and<00:01:20.280> internal<00:01:20.820> weakness<00:01:21.240> and<00:01:21.509> I

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
infections and internal weakness and I

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:24.140 
infections and internal weakness and I
notice<00:01:22.409> that<00:01:22.619> at<00:01:22.740> the<00:01:22.830> top<00:01:23.040> it's<00:01:23.400> thinning<00:01:23.909> out

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150 
notice that at the top it's thinning out

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:26.210 
notice that at the top it's thinning out
a<00:01:24.210> little<00:01:24.479> bit<00:01:24.720> here<00:01:24.960> in<00:01:24.990> solving<00:01:25.500> this<00:01:25.979> is

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220 
a little bit here in solving this is

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:27.740 
a little bit here in solving this is
probably<00:01:26.520> damage<00:01:27.000> that<00:01:27.210> will<00:01:27.330> eventually

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750 
probably damage that will eventually

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:30.200 
probably damage that will eventually
kill<00:01:27.960> it<00:01:28.140> try<00:01:28.680> to<00:01:28.740> educate<00:01:28.950> the<00:01:29.490> public<00:01:29.640> try<00:01:30.150> to

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210 
kill it try to educate the public try to

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:32.450 
kill it try to educate the public try to
explain<00:01:30.659> what<00:01:31.049> damage<00:01:31.470> they<00:01:31.500> can<00:01:31.710> actually<00:01:32.220> do

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
explain what damage they can actually do

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:34.460 
explain what damage they can actually do
to<00:01:32.670> the<00:01:32.790> cactus<00:01:32.970> but<00:01:33.329> yes<00:01:33.540> we<00:01:33.780> have<00:01:33.960> arrested
