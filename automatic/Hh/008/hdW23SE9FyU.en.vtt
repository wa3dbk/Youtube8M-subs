00:00:02.450 --> 00:00:06.180
 Unfortunately, Britney Spears and the notebook are not human antesten to theirs 

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:10.690
 Performance from the derby tie in front of 320 spectators were the red roses against 

00:00:10.690 --> 00:00:15.209
 Mitaufsteiger v wants Frohnlach in the first round but game-determining 

00:00:15.209 --> 00:00:18.209
 alone you can not win a game 

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:23.210
 13 start minutes to see one or the other uncertainty in WÃ¼rzburg 

00:00:24.339 --> 00:00:28.909
 and also forward car no longer capable of two good options something 

00:00:28.909 --> 00:00:30.999
 To make countable 

00:00:30.999 --> 00:00:32.080
 after ten minutes 

00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:34.690
 It was Pascal Kamolz 

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:36.630
 after a good half hour 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:40.520
 Christian is the Czechs the lead for the home side on his head 

00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:46.330
 Bayern is still locked and Stefan Zimmer has injured Kamps 

00:00:46.330 --> 00:00:51.640
 when Bittner made his first two league games for 23-year-olds 

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:55.460
 his cause quite properly from the guests from Upper Franconia has so far 

00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:59.880
 Clinic to see under roof most of that is going to break with a 0 0 

00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:04.360
 thanks to the 43 10 minute free kick for VfL 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:08.549
 from it a quickie that I out of the nothing the 1 

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:16.250
 not he will believe we repeat the gate of just now it really was 

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:20.680
 so two free kicks in the final minutes before the break brought 

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:23.680
 the red roses with 0 2 2 in arrears 

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:29.790
 the derby against the BSV Bern just three days so here you could 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:30.799
 forces wear 

00:01:30.799 --> 00:01:35.200
 a valid actor may have got him yummy you felt that air 

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:38.280
 was out 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:40.930
 Sandro Reusch came on in the break 

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:45.500
 25 minutes later after casting males had to board the place again 

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:47.840
 leave 

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:52.020
 despite being outnumbered the long loading times ten minutes before the end by Andreas 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:54.750
 Kirchner the 1 2-goal 

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:57.750
 there was still enough time for at least one point 

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:01.079
 but it did not even take two minutes 

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:04.079
 there the guests restored the old distance 

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:09.729
 and not only that, like last Saturday in Ismaning Liesen itself 

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:13.120
 Tigers slaying nothing happens hits four and five 

00:02:13.839 --> 00:02:17.669
 This is one in five makes clear that the red roses in their performances 

00:02:17.669 --> 00:02:20.669
 simply not constant enough 

00:02:21.309 --> 00:02:25.539
 Too bad deeds so the therapy success is only half the value
