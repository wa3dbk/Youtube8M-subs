00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.620
 tms this change and this chanchito is 

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:10.920
 Extremely easy to make is a bottle 

00:00:06.620 --> 00:00:13.320
 of recycling and swimming pools and this is a 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:16.500
 little paper mate cut out and 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:19.859
 stuck everything with rubber sometimes I'm going to 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:23.970
 give here to support Sofia and here 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:26.580
 we have another thing like that is that you already have 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:31.920
 coins already have the hole here 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:35.820
 we have another one that is an aroma 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:37.739
 see how easy it is to do so 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:40.110
 home you create with bottles what 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:42.120
 that what they want according to the form is that 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:45.379
 this bottle for those true worms 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:45.379
 that was not good for toad 

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:54.930
 because the container is big we are going to 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:59.430
 put this here so that they say 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:01:02.820
 or is it just that I said it in the house and say 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:06.720
 I did not do it on the channel 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:08.790
 says dad how beautiful exactly but 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:10.770
 first let's make the legs because 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:13.400
 if we do not get it, it's going to be for us 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:13.400
 all sides 

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:20.710
 exactly good now well in the house 

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:22.990
 they are going to ask their parents to do 

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:25.540
 the hole because sometimes that can be 

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:29.080
 dangerous, I'm going to ask everyone to 

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:32.320
 make a little ball because we're going to do the 

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:34.960
 patitas then first we take the 

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:37.869
 plasticine and we make small ball 

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:41.289
 we stretch here the hand is wide open 

00:01:37.869 --> 00:01:45.909
 and so this helps the development of the 

00:01:41.289 --> 00:01:49.680
 motorcycle now fine very good good you throw 

00:01:45.909 --> 00:01:52.470
 silicon that they think I'm going to make 

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:54.630
 the eyes good if it's okay but what 

00:01:52.470 --> 00:02:01.590
 we can do with these four for what 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:02:03.330
 are those 412 until landing lands and 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:06.180
 let's find that we stay up on 

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:09.280
 little care we forget to help 

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:12.190
 land the 12 

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:16.090
 and since it's plasticine, that's one of the 

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:17.840
 advantages let's help to tighten it and that for 

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:20.780
 let it be there 

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:24.349
 in the house then they make him more for half 

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:25.800
 if they want until the little one likes it 

00:02:24.349 --> 00:02:29.880
 the formica 

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:34.650
 Now that we are going to make the eyes 

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:36.410
 We call a leaf in which we are going to 

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:39.360
 draw the eyes 

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:43.710
 then I can know what I'm going to do 

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:46.860
 so that we go much faster 

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:49.780
 we make a little ball 

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:53.560
 two balls 

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:56.709
 and inside we make other brave if 

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:58.600
 I want you have a little white dot and only 

00:02:56.709 --> 00:03:00.620
 filling 

00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:03.220
 just gnashed 

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:05.470
 and there I have the objects 

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:08.500
 then I'm going to ask the diego month 

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:10.870
 go trimming while we go 

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:13.330
 making appointments pass me the ball of 

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:16.780
 nice air we have here the two little balls 

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:19.390
 how do we convert this into an ear 

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:23.940
 the girls of that cute I put the 

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:28.030
 little ball at hand with this part I'm going 

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:33.330
 crushing crushing crushing and what 

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:39.100
 way is 511 then crushed like that 

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:43.630
 and since it was the shape of the couple and 

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:48.120
 this one I put here crushed term here now 

00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:50.200
 yes it crushes me and we're going to crush it 

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:54.550
 smash 

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:57.700
 and that's very good and then we're going to 

00:03:54.550 --> 00:03:59.400
 put up here while continuing 

00:03:57.700 --> 00:04:02.819
 cutting 

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:05.760
 Each child according to his age can do 

00:04:02.819 --> 00:04:07.920
 different things and also according to 

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:10.409
 time here on TV we have to do 

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:12.659
 things faster than at home in 

00:04:10.409 --> 00:04:16.579
 house can invent more ways if 

00:04:12.659 --> 00:04:19.919
 they want there is that fast and diego excellent 

00:04:16.579 --> 00:04:23.820
 Then Luis Diego, I'm going to leave you 

00:04:19.919 --> 00:04:26.720
 that you how cut it decide where 

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:29.789
 he puts his eyes 

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:31.269
 you already put this ojito where you 

00:04:29.789 --> 00:04:36.739
 wish 

00:04:31.269 --> 00:04:38.899
 and let the video put that with 

00:04:36.739 --> 00:04:41.479
 a lot of attention all these jobs 

00:04:38.899 --> 00:04:44.479
 they develop a lot the fine motor 

00:04:41.479 --> 00:04:49.009
 that I'm going to be honest, well, what 

00:04:44.479 --> 00:04:51.259
 good piggy bank to save there is 

00:04:49.009 --> 00:04:54.079
 simply made by themselves and with 

00:04:51.259 --> 00:04:56.389
 something that would have gone as waste 

00:04:54.079 --> 00:04:58.519
 we become something new and beautiful that 

00:04:56.389 --> 00:05:01.230
 is already having expression now 

00:04:58.519 --> 00:05:03.120
 each one put an ear 

00:05:01.230 --> 00:05:06.810
 as in each one he puts a digital 

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:08.970
 let's take care of the rabito right now and very 

00:05:06.810 --> 00:05:12.070
 well because now if on top of the line 

00:05:08.970 --> 00:05:14.950
 put this one sheep 

00:05:12.070 --> 00:05:18.129
 and we'll crush it a little bit because that 

00:05:14.950 --> 00:05:21.770
 helps you to get out and know how to be 

00:05:18.129 --> 00:05:26.600
 sofÃ­a have not even put the little ears 

00:05:21.770 --> 00:05:30.530
 very nice how nice we accommodate them 

00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:32.450
 I've been dreaming for a long time this something 

00:05:30.530 --> 00:05:35.420
 which is that it's still cool 

00:05:32.450 --> 00:05:36.890
 I could turn around just like that the legs 

00:05:35.420 --> 00:05:40.430
 you have to leave them for a little while 

00:05:36.890 --> 00:05:42.140
 dry but let's do something here 

00:05:40.430 --> 00:05:44.690
 while you were taking care of him 

00:05:42.140 --> 00:05:48.100

00:05:44.690 --> 00:05:51.170

 more uncomfortable vueltitas is the rite that 

00:06:03.410 --> 00:06:08.560

00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:16.030
 they had a lot of fun that right good 

00:06:13.700 --> 00:06:18.530
 in the house we can continue doing 

00:06:16.030 --> 00:06:20.150
 different piggy banks 

00:06:18.530 --> 00:06:21.710
