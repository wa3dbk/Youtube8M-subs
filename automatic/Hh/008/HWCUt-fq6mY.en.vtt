calipers up front these are the four
piston<00:00:19.350> calipers<00:00:20.250> over<00:00:20.520> a<00:00:20.550> 13-inch<00:00:21.060> rotor

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:21.300 
piston calipers over a 13-inch rotor

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:23.990 
piston calipers over a 13-inch rotor
those<00:00:21.840> are<00:00:22.050> brembo<00:00:22.529> calipers<00:00:22.680> they<00:00:23.340> with<00:00:23.850> the

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:24.000 
those are brembo calipers they with the

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.330 
those are brembo calipers they with the
SGI<00:00:24.300> logo<00:00:24.689> on<00:00:24.840> so<00:00:25.289> that's<00:00:25.500> the<00:00:25.619> slotted<00:00:26.189> those

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:26.340 
SGI logo on so that's the slotted those

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:28.339 
SGI logo on so that's the slotted those
are<00:00:26.460> the<00:00:26.519> 13-inch<00:00:26.880> slotted<00:00:27.300> rotors<00:00:27.689> and<00:00:28.109> over

00:00:28.339 --> 00:00:28.349 
are the 13-inch slotted rotors and over

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:30.769 
are the 13-inch slotted rotors and over
this<00:00:28.470> way<00:00:28.680> we've<00:00:28.920> got<00:00:29.130> that<00:00:29.279> nice<00:00:29.519> fat<00:00:29.970> four

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:30.779 
this way we've got that nice fat four

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:33.830 
this way we've got that nice fat four
millimeter<00:00:31.320> wider<00:00:31.679> thicker<00:00:32.460> rather<00:00:32.840> front

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:33.840

sway obviously you can see with that
aluminum<00:00:36.960> lower<00:00:37.320> control<00:00:37.559> arms<00:00:38.129> and<00:00:39.290> then<00:00:40.290> I'm

00:00:40.459 --> 00:00:40.469 
aluminum lower control arms and then I'm

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:42.910 
aluminum lower control arms and then I'm
going<00:00:40.559> to<00:00:40.649> try<00:00:40.800> to<00:00:40.829> get<00:00:41.040> underneath<00:00:41.340> here<00:00:41.640> and

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:42.920 
going to try to get underneath here and

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:45.080 
going to try to get underneath here and
see<00:00:43.920> if<00:00:43.950> we<00:00:44.100> can<00:00:44.250> take<00:00:44.370> a<00:00:44.430> look<00:00:44.520> at<00:00:44.760> the<00:00:44.820> exhaust

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.090 
see if we can take a look at the exhaust

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:47.150 
see if we can take a look at the exhaust
a<00:00:45.300> little<00:00:45.539> bit<00:00:45.690> take<00:00:46.230> a<00:00:46.260> look<00:00:46.410> at<00:00:46.530> this<00:00:46.620> engine

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160 
a little bit take a look at this engine

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:49.310 
a little bit take a look at this engine
mount<00:00:47.370> now<00:00:47.520> the<00:00:47.579> I'm<00:00:48.120> sorry<00:00:48.329> the<00:00:48.539> tranny<00:00:49.050> mount

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320 
mount now the I'm sorry the tranny mount

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:50.990 
mount now the I'm sorry the tranny mount
the<00:00:49.590> training<00:00:49.920> mount<00:00:50.070> is<00:00:50.219> I<00:00:50.489> think<00:00:50.640> they<00:00:50.850> said

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
the training mount is I think they said

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.670 
the training mount is I think they said
it's<00:00:51.120> four<00:00:51.420> hundred<00:00:51.750> percent<00:00:52.820> more<00:00:53.820> hard<00:00:54.210> than

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:54.680 
it's four hundred percent more hard than

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:58.639 
it's four hundred percent more hard than
on<00:00:55.680> a<00:00:55.710> WRX<00:00:56.309> or<00:00:56.670> a<00:00:57.030> regular<00:00:57.270> impreza<00:00:57.750> which

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649 
on a WRX or a regular impreza which

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:00.349 
on a WRX or a regular impreza which
really<00:00:58.890> helps<00:00:59.280> the<00:00:59.340> field<00:00:59.940> that<00:01:00.210> you're

00:01:00.349 --> 00:01:00.359 
really helps the field that you're

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:01.970 
really helps the field that you're
planted<00:01:00.809> as<00:01:00.930> you<00:01:01.020> sway<00:01:01.260> the<00:01:01.410> car<00:01:01.559> back<00:01:01.770> and

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
planted as you sway the car back and

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:04.070 
planted as you sway the car back and
forth<00:01:02.210> from<00:01:03.210> left<00:01:03.480> to<00:01:03.539> right<00:01:03.629> if<00:01:03.840> you're<00:01:03.960> going

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 
forth from left to right if you're going

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:05.990 
forth from left to right if you're going
through<00:01:04.320> like<00:01:04.439> an<00:01:04.559> SS<00:01:04.890> you<00:01:05.549> really<00:01:05.820> want<00:01:05.970> to

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
through like an SS you really want to

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:07.670 
through like an SS you really want to
feel<00:01:06.150> the<00:01:06.270> transmission<00:01:06.869> solid<00:01:07.470> you<00:01:07.530> don't

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
feel the transmission solid you don't

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:08.929 
feel the transmission solid you don't
want<00:01:07.799> to<00:01:07.860> feel<00:01:07.950> all<00:01:08.130> that<00:01:08.159> weight<00:01:08.490> shifting

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939 
want to feel all that weight shifting

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:10.370 
want to feel all that weight shifting
back<00:01:09.119> and<00:01:09.150> forth<00:01:09.390> and<00:01:09.780> underneath<00:01:10.080> the<00:01:10.140> car

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
back and forth and underneath the car

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:12.530 
back and forth and underneath the car
here's<00:01:11.130> a<00:01:11.189> look<00:01:11.310> at<00:01:11.430> the<00:01:11.520> back<00:01:11.700> side<00:01:12.000> of<00:01:12.270> the

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
here's a look at the back side of the

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:14.510 
here's a look at the back side of the
front<00:01:12.750> calipers<00:01:13.260> and<00:01:13.470> it's<00:01:14.070> really<00:01:14.340> nice<00:01:14.460> that

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
front calipers and it's really nice that

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:16.460 
front calipers and it's really nice that
they<00:01:14.760> have<00:01:14.850> a<00:01:14.909> very<00:01:15.150> quick<00:01:15.479> easy<00:01:15.689> release<00:01:16.229> so

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470 
they have a very quick easy release so

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:18.260 
they have a very quick easy release so
you<00:01:16.560> can<00:01:16.680> swap<00:01:16.890> pads<00:01:17.159> in<00:01:17.340> and<00:01:17.490> out<00:01:17.610> if<00:01:18.119> you

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270 
you can swap pads in and out if you

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:19.730 
you can swap pads in and out if you
wanted<00:01:18.479> to<00:01:18.540> put<00:01:18.630> track<00:01:18.930> pads<00:01:19.170> in<00:01:19.350> when<00:01:19.470> you<00:01:19.560> the

wanted to put track pads in when you the

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:21.170 
wanted to put track pads in when you the
track<00:01:19.979> and<00:01:20.130> then<00:01:20.189> drive<00:01:20.400> home<00:01:20.430> on<00:01:20.820> your<00:01:20.939> street

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
the pins out the side pop the metal out

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:26.990 
the pins out the side pop the metal out
grab<00:01:25.439> with<00:01:25.619> pliers<00:01:25.830> put<00:01:26.310> them<00:01:26.430> back<00:01:26.490> in<00:01:26.700> pinch

back in the whole process only takes you
know<00:01:29.250> a<00:01:29.460> minute<00:01:30.090> aside<00:01:30.360> and<00:01:30.630> here's<00:01:31.640> another

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 
know a minute aside and here's another

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:34.039 
know a minute aside and here's another
look<00:01:32.909> from<00:01:32.970> the<00:01:33.240> right<00:01:33.420> hand<00:01:33.630> side<00:01:33.750> from<00:01:34.020> the

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:34.049 
look from the right hand side from the

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:42.460 
look from the right hand side from the
passenger<00:01:34.560> side<00:01:34.740> of<00:01:34.799> the<00:01:34.920> car

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:42.470 

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:46.460 

so<00:01:43.470> the<00:01:43.560> Roberts<00:01:43.950> 245<00:01:44.580> 40<00:01:45.030> r18<00:01:45.210> and<00:01:45.930> these<00:01:46.320> are

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:46.470 
so the Roberts 245 40 r18 and these are

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:48.890 
so the Roberts 245 40 r18 and these are
the<00:01:46.530> special<00:01:46.920> gold<00:01:47.190> world<00:01:47.970> rally<00:01:48.240> car<00:01:48.390> edition

the special gold world rally car edition
wheels<00:01:49.260> and<00:01:49.590> then<00:01:50.100> again<00:01:50.340> we<00:01:50.430> have<00:01:50.520> twelve

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:50.790 
wheels and then again we have twelve

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:52.880
