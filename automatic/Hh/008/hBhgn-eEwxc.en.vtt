put a lot of time I upgraded the Pistons
the<00:01:39.150> connecting<00:01:39.930> rods<00:01:40.170> that<00:01:40.409> everything<00:01:40.979> they

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.100 
the connecting rods that everything they

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:43.700 
the connecting rods that everything they
could<00:01:41.159> to<00:01:41.340> get<00:01:41.610> as<00:01:41.759> much<00:01:41.909> power<00:01:42.150> as<00:01:42.299> they<00:01:42.509> can<00:01:42.780> a

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:43.710 
could to get as much power as they can a

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:45.770 
could to get as much power as they can a
more<00:01:44.430> efficient<00:01:44.820> exhaust<00:01:45.210> and<00:01:45.479> like<00:01:45.600> I<00:01:45.720> said

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
more efficient exhaust and like I said

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:48.560 
more efficient exhaust and like I said
they<00:01:46.170> had<00:01:46.590> a<00:01:46.619> more<00:01:47.340> race<00:01:47.579> oriented<00:01:47.970> Pistons

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570 
they had a more race oriented Pistons

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:52.280 
they had a more race oriented Pistons
they<00:01:49.470> did<00:01:49.770> increase<00:01:50.729> the<00:01:50.790> turbo<00:01:51.299> boost<00:01:51.509> I

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:52.290 
they did increase the turbo boost I

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:54.139 
they did increase the turbo boost I
can't<00:01:52.770> get<00:01:52.950> a<00:01:52.979> real<00:01:53.280> number<00:01:53.579> on<00:01:53.850> this<00:01:54.000> I<00:01:54.090> think

00:01:54.139 --> 00:01:54.149 
can't get a real number on this I think

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:57.230 
can't get a real number on this I think
it's<00:01:54.509> more<00:01:54.750> of<00:01:54.780> like<00:01:55.259> a<00:01:55.409> 6<00:01:55.979> to<00:01:56.130> 7<00:01:56.460> psi<00:01:56.880> gain

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:57.240 
it's more of like a 6 to 7 psi gain

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:59.030 
it's more of like a 6 to 7 psi gain
which<00:01:57.899> may<00:01:58.079> not<00:01:58.229> seem<00:01:58.409> like<00:01:58.560> much<00:01:58.590> but<00:01:58.950> when

00:01:59.030 --> 00:01:59.040 
which may not seem like much but when

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:00.649 
which may not seem like much but when
ever<00:01:59.189> comes<00:01:59.430> to<00:01:59.549> these<00:01:59.700> turbo<00:02:00.030> fours<00:02:00.270> that<00:02:00.479> is

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:00.659 
ever comes to these turbo fours that is

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:04.700 
ever comes to these turbo fours that is
a<00:02:00.750> lot<00:02:01.140> of<00:02:01.500> boost<00:02:01.890> so<00:02:02.479> yeah<00:02:03.479> it<00:02:04.380> really

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:04.710 
a lot of boost so yeah it really

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:06.350 
a lot of boost so yeah it really
threw<00:02:04.950> it<00:02:05.070> out<00:02:05.189> there<00:02:05.399> I'm<00:02:05.610> you<00:02:06.060> know<00:02:06.180> like<00:02:06.329> a

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:06.360 
threw it out there I'm you know like a

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:09.169 
threw it out there I'm you know like a
better<00:02:06.710> better<00:02:07.710> turbine<00:02:08.220> better<00:02:08.640> wastegate

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:09.179 
better better turbine better wastegate

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:10.609 
better better turbine better wastegate
stuff<00:02:09.450> like<00:02:09.599> that<00:02:09.780> cause<00:02:10.080> where<00:02:10.319> did<00:02:10.470> their

00:02:10.609 --> 00:02:10.619 
stuff like that cause where did their

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:12.619 
stuff like that cause where did their
thing<00:02:10.649> to<00:02:10.979> the<00:02:11.099> turbo<00:02:11.459> and<00:02:11.670> then<00:02:12.239> they<00:02:12.390> also

00:02:12.619 --> 00:02:12.629 
thing to the turbo and then they also

00:02:12.629 --> 00:02:13.430 
thing to the turbo and then they also
reach

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440 
reach

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:15.050 
reach

our numbers are 395 horsepower and 400
pound-feet<00:02:25.830> of<00:02:25.920> torque<00:02:26.040> so<00:02:26.670> a<00:02:26.700> bit<00:02:27.090> more

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:27.270

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:29.490 
torque than we need but I appreciate we

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:31.670 
torque than we need but I appreciate we
won't<00:02:29.640> mind<00:02:29.880> it<00:02:30.090> so<00:02:30.690> let's<00:02:30.930> go<00:02:31.050> ahead<00:02:31.170> and<00:02:31.440> roll

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:31.680 
won't mind it so let's go ahead and roll

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:33.770 
won't mind it so let's go ahead and roll
on<00:02:31.860> over<00:02:32.190> to<00:02:32.370> the<00:02:32.550> suspension<00:02:33.090> side<00:02:33.480> of<00:02:33.660> this

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:33.780 
on over to the suspension side of this

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:36.680 
on over to the suspension side of this
and<00:02:34.050> continue<00:02:34.830> building<00:02:35.550> up<00:02:35.670> this<00:02:35.790> car<00:02:36.060> for

and continue building up this car for
the<00:02:36.780> front<00:02:36.990> brakes<00:02:37.290> they<00:02:37.530> did<00:02:37.830> go<00:02:38.130> with<00:02:38.460> a<00:02:38.520> sort

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:39.180 
the front brakes they did go with a sort

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:41.540 
the front brakes they did go with a sort
of<00:02:39.210> a<00:02:39.330> six<00:02:39.630> piston<00:02:40.080> vented<00:02:40.740> front<00:02:41.040> brake<00:02:41.310> they

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:41.550 
of a six piston vented front brake they

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:43.580 
of a six piston vented front brake they
upgrade<00:02:41.940> the<00:02:42.060> front<00:02:42.270> brakes<00:02:42.540> but<00:02:43.140> they<00:02:43.290> didn't

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:43.590 
upgrade the front brakes but they didn't

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:45.860 
upgrade the front brakes but they didn't
do<00:02:43.680> anything<00:02:43.860> to<00:02:44.130> the<00:02:44.220> rear<00:02:44.400> brakes<00:02:44.670> so<00:02:44.970> kind

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:45.870 
do anything to the rear brakes so kind

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:47.150 
do anything to the rear brakes so kind
of<00:02:45.990> hard<00:02:46.140> to<00:02:46.170> balance<00:02:46.560> that<00:02:46.680> and<00:02:46.740> I'm<00:02:46.890> gonna<00:02:47.010> go

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:47.160 
of hard to balance that and I'm gonna go

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:48.590 
of hard to balance that and I'm gonna go
ahead<00:02:47.220> and<00:02:47.310> go<00:02:47.490> just<00:02:47.730> sport<00:02:48.030> brakes<00:02:48.390> in

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:48.600

they<00:03:18.750> did<00:03:18.959> do<00:03:19.140> some<00:03:19.380> minor<00:03:19.680> tweaking<00:03:20.070> stuff

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:20.430 
they did do some minor tweaking stuff

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:21.920 
they did do some minor tweaking stuff
like<00:03:20.580> this<00:03:20.700> beefing<00:03:21.150> up<00:03:21.239> some<00:03:21.450> parts<00:03:21.750> to

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:21.930 
like this beefing up some parts to

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:24.620 
like this beefing up some parts to
handle<00:03:22.620> the<00:03:22.739> extra<00:03:22.860> horsepower<00:03:23.340> but<00:03:23.790> they<00:03:24.420> did

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:24.630 
handle the extra horsepower but they did

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:26.960 
handle the extra horsepower but they did
make<00:03:24.810> the<00:03:24.959> track<00:03:25.200> about<00:03:25.530> think<00:03:25.890> 12<00:03:26.310> millimeter

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:26.970 
make the track about think 12 millimeter

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:29.510 
make the track about think 12 millimeter
12<00:03:27.480> millimeters<00:03:28.050> wider<00:03:28.350> and<00:03:28.709> they<00:03:29.220> lowered

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:29.520 
12 millimeters wider and they lowered

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:32.540 
12 millimeters wider and they lowered
the<00:03:29.610> front<00:03:29.880> end<00:03:30.090> by<00:03:30.239> 10<00:03:30.600> millimeters<00:03:31.170> so<00:03:31.550> they

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:32.550 
the front end by 10 millimeters so they

00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:34.640 
the front end by 10 millimeters so they
there<00:03:32.910> is<00:03:33.030> a<00:03:33.239> know<00:03:33.870> some<00:03:34.110> subtle<00:03:34.410> differences

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:34.650 
there is a know some subtle differences

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:36.530 
there is a know some subtle differences
but<00:03:35.370> nothing<00:03:35.730> that<00:03:35.850> I<00:03:35.880> can<00:03:36.060> really<00:03:36.209> simulate

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:36.540 
but nothing that I can really simulate

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:38.750 
but nothing that I can really simulate
without<00:03:36.989> going<00:03:37.230> full<00:03:37.500> racing<00:03:37.950> which<00:03:38.190> is<00:03:38.459> not

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:38.760 
without going full racing which is not

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:41.750 
without going full racing which is not
what<00:03:39.120> would<00:03:39.270> be<00:03:39.420> in<00:03:39.600> this<00:03:39.720> car<00:03:40.020> so<00:03:40.370> as<00:03:41.370> for<00:03:41.640> the

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:41.760 
what would be in this car so as for the

what would be in this car so as for the
Robards<00:03:42.239> non-stop<00:03:42.570> stuff<00:03:42.840> don't<00:03:43.080> worry<00:03:43.380> about

00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:43.470 
Robards non-stop stuff don't worry about

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:44.750 
Robards non-stop stuff don't worry about
it<00:03:43.709> for<00:03:43.860> the<00:03:43.890> weight<00:03:44.100> this<00:03:44.310> thing<00:03:44.580> weighs

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:44.760 
it for the weight this thing weighs

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:50.120 
it for the weight this thing weighs
3,000<00:03:46.730> 104<00:03:48.410> 3318<00:03:49.410> pounds<00:03:49.800> I<00:03:49.830> don't<00:03:49.950> know<00:03:50.010> why<00:03:50.100> I

3,000 104 3318 pounds I don't know why I

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:51.830 
3,000 104 3318 pounds I don't know why I
keep<00:03:50.250> saying<00:03:50.310> 100<00:03:50.910> so<00:03:51.330> let's<00:03:51.510> see<00:03:51.600> how<00:03:51.660> close

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:51.840 
keep saying 100 so let's see how close

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:54.560 
keep saying 100 so let's see how close
were<00:03:51.959> gonna<00:03:52.080> get<00:03:52.320> Oh<00:03:53.090> gorgeous<00:03:54.090> three

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:54.570 
were gonna get Oh gorgeous three

00:03:54.570 --> 00:03:56.630 
were gonna get Oh gorgeous three
thousand<00:03:55.050> three<00:03:55.230> hundred<00:03:55.320> and<00:03:55.650> nineteen<00:03:56.040> one

thousand three hundred and nineteen one

00:03:56.640 --> 00:03:58.520 
thousand three hundred and nineteen one
pound<00:03:56.880> away<00:03:57.120> but<00:03:57.360> obviously<00:03:57.750> we're<00:03:57.930> not<00:03:58.230> done

00:03:58.520 --> 00:03:58.530 
pound away but obviously we're not done

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:01.280 
pound away but obviously we're not done
I<00:03:58.560> still<00:03:58.830> got<00:03:58.950> to<00:03:59.040> put<00:03:59.130> rims<00:03:59.370> on<00:03:59.640> slow<00:04:00.170> and<00:04:01.170> I

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:01.290 
I still got to put rims on slow and I

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:03.650 
I still got to put rims on slow and I
still<00:04:01.500> got<00:04:01.620> to<00:04:01.709> do<00:04:01.769> the<00:04:01.800> transmission<00:04:02.660> they

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:03.660 
still got to do the transmission they

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:07.070 
still got to do the transmission they
did<00:04:04.019> upgrade<00:04:04.620> to<00:04:05.070> a<00:04:05.100> more<00:04:05.250> efficient<00:04:06.120> single

00:04:07.070 --> 00:04:07.080 
did upgrade to a more efficient single

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:10.280 
did upgrade to a more efficient single
clutch<00:04:07.350> I<00:04:08.060> would<00:04:09.060> say<00:04:09.239> the<00:04:09.390> sport<00:04:09.660> clutch<00:04:09.930> but

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:10.290 
clutch I would say the sport clutch but

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:11.930 
clutch I would say the sport clutch but
yeah<00:04:10.769> we're<00:04:10.980> going<00:04:11.130> to<00:04:11.190> go<00:04:11.280> and<00:04:11.459> say<00:04:11.550> the<00:04:11.670> sport

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:11.940 
yeah we're going to go and say the sport

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:14.180 
yeah we're going to go and say the sport
clutch<00:04:12.420> it<00:04:12.600> and<00:04:12.860> then<00:04:13.860> for<00:04:14.070> the

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:14.190 
clutch it and then for the

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:15.610 
clutch it and then for the
transmission<00:04:14.880> they<00:04:14.970> had<00:04:15.150> sort<00:04:15.330> of<00:04:15.390> a

00:04:15.610 --> 00:04:15.620 
transmission they had sort of a

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:17.659 
transmission they had sort of a
carbon-fiber<00:04:16.620> Philemon

00:04:17.659 --> 00:04:17.669 
carbon-fiber Philemon

00:04:17.669 --> 00:04:19.699 
carbon-fiber Philemon
to<00:04:17.880> the<00:04:18.000> first<00:04:18.330> three<00:04:18.720> or<00:04:18.750> four<00:04:19.080> gears<00:04:19.350> just<00:04:19.560> to

00:04:19.699 --> 00:04:19.709 
to the first three or four gears just to

00:04:19.709 --> 00:04:21.140 
to the first three or four gears just to
handle<00:04:20.040> the<00:04:20.130> extra<00:04:20.160> power<00:04:20.700> that's<00:04:20.880> gonna<00:04:21.030> be

00:04:21.140 --> 00:04:21.150 
handle the extra power that's gonna be

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:22.969 
handle the extra power that's gonna be
coming<00:04:21.269> to<00:04:21.539> it<00:04:21.660> because<00:04:22.140> when<00:04:22.380> you<00:04:22.470> go<00:04:22.650> from<00:04:22.890> a

00:04:22.969 --> 00:04:22.979 
coming to it because when you go from a

00:04:22.979 --> 00:04:25.720 
coming to it because when you go from a
200<00:04:23.760> horsepower<00:04:24.030> car<00:04:24.990> or<00:04:25.229> three

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:25.730 
200 horsepower car or three

00:04:25.730 --> 00:04:28.120 
200 horsepower car or three
bear<00:04:26.150> up<00:04:26.270> to<00:04:26.390> a<00:04:26.450> 400-horsepower<00:04:27.440> you<00:04:27.980> know

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:28.130 
bear up to a 400-horsepower you know

00:04:28.130 --> 00:04:31.000 
bear up to a 400-horsepower you know
that's<00:04:28.340> a<00:04:28.550> lot<00:04:29.240> of<00:04:29.480> extra<00:04:29.900> power<00:04:30.290> and<00:04:30.740> you<00:04:30.860> have

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:31.010 
that's a lot of extra power and you have

00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:32.260 
that's a lot of extra power and you have
to<00:04:31.100> make<00:04:31.250> sure<00:04:31.430> it's<00:04:31.580> your<00:04:31.700> system<00:04:32.090> that's

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:32.270 
to make sure it's your system that's

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:34.120 
to make sure it's your system that's
actually<00:04:32.540> pushed<00:04:32.780> in<00:04:32.930> the<00:04:33.020> car<00:04:33.200> can<00:04:33.800> handle

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:34.130 
actually pushed in the car can handle

00:04:34.130 --> 00:04:36.340 
actually pushed in the car can handle
that<00:04:34.280> without<00:04:34.550> just<00:04:34.790> blowing<00:04:35.300> up<00:04:35.480> so<00:04:36.140> we<00:04:36.320> are

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:36.350 
that without just blowing up so we are

00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:37.300 
that without just blowing up so we are
gonna<00:04:36.530> go<00:04:36.680> and<00:04:36.800> go<00:04:36.920> to<00:04:36.980> the<00:04:37.070> street

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:37.310 
gonna go and go to the street

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:39.430 
gonna go and go to the street
transmission<00:04:37.850> the<00:04:38.120> gears<00:04:38.510> and<00:04:38.870> the<00:04:39.170> final

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:39.440 
transmission the gears and the final

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:42.100 
transmission the gears and the final
drive<00:04:39.650> are<00:04:39.890> identical<00:04:40.490> to<00:04:40.670> the<00:04:40.880> actual<00:04:41.330> STI<00:04:41.750> so

00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:42.110 
drive are identical to the actual STI so

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:43.570 
drive are identical to the actual STI so
I<00:04:42.290> don't<00:04:42.650> have<00:04:42.740> to<00:04:42.860> really<00:04:43.010> worry<00:04:43.100> about

00:04:43.570 --> 00:04:43.580 
I don't have to really worry about

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:45.220 
I don't have to really worry about
adjusting<00:04:43.760> anything<00:04:44.420> since<00:04:44.870> everything's

00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:45.230 
adjusting anything since everything's

00:04:45.230 --> 00:04:47.890 
adjusting anything since everything's
gonna<00:04:45.830> be<00:04:46.040> roughly<00:04:46.310> the<00:04:46.430> same<00:04:46.520> as<00:04:46.940> for<00:04:47.840> the

00:04:47.890 --> 00:04:47.900 
gonna be roughly the same as for the

system everything is identical from the
original<00:04:51.800> STI<00:04:52.130> you<00:04:52.250> really<00:04:52.580> don't<00:04:52.730> have<00:04:52.880> to

00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:52.940 
original STI you really don't have to

00:04:52.940 --> 00:04:56.440 
original STI you really don't have to
adjust<00:04:53.450> anything<00:04:54.100> tires<00:04:55.100> are<00:04:55.610> the<00:04:55.850> same<00:04:56.090> same

00:04:56.440 --> 00:04:56.450 
adjust anything tires are the same same

00:04:56.450 --> 00:04:59.380 
adjust anything tires are the same same
width<00:04:56.720> same<00:04:57.400> pretty<00:04:58.400> much<00:04:58.490> rubber<00:04:58.820> compound

00:04:59.380 --> 00:04:59.390 
width same pretty much rubber compound

00:04:59.390 --> 00:05:00.850 
width same pretty much rubber compound
and<00:04:59.810> as<00:05:00.020> for<00:05:00.200> the<00:05:00.260> rims<00:05:00.410> like<00:05:00.560> I<00:05:00.650> said<00:05:00.770> I'm

00:05:00.850 --> 00:05:00.860 
and as for the rims like I said I'm

I<00:05:05.360> do<00:05:05.540> try<00:05:06.080> to<00:05:06.110> pre<00:05:06.560> build<00:05:06.830> these<00:05:07.040> so<00:05:07.220> I<00:05:07.250> don't

00:05:07.510 --> 00:05:07.520 
I do try to pre build these so I don't

00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:09.340 
I do try to pre build these so I don't
look<00:05:07.670> like<00:05:07.790> a<00:05:07.850> complete<00:05:08.210> jackass<00:05:08.450> but<00:05:08.990> there

00:05:09.340 --> 00:05:09.350

matte black but yeah what can you do

00:05:14.030 --> 00:05:16.210 
matte black but yeah what can you do
right<00:05:14.200> rim<00:05:15.200> size<00:05:15.440> is<00:05:15.650> the<00:05:15.740> same<00:05:15.950> and

00:05:16.210 --> 00:05:16.220 
right rim size is the same and

00:05:16.220 --> 00:05:18.460 
right rim size is the same and
everything<00:05:16.460> else<00:05:16.730> is<00:05:17.060> pretty<00:05:17.720> much<00:05:17.810> it<00:05:18.110> saw

00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:48.410 
actually I should have seen where this

00:05:48.410 --> 00:05:54.670 
actually I should have seen where this
sat<00:05:52.630> well<00:05:53.630> actually<00:05:53.780> there's<00:05:54.110> really<00:05:54.320> nothing

I<00:05:54.920> can<00:05:55.190> do<00:05:55.550> because<00:05:55.790> there's<00:05:56.060> not<00:05:56.210> a<00:05:56.270> FQ<00:05:56.720> 400<00:05:57.320> I

00:05:57.400 --> 00:05:57.410 
I can do because there's not a FQ 400 I

00:05:57.410 --> 00:06:03.700 
I can do because there's not a FQ 400 I
can<00:05:57.590> compare<00:05:57.920> it<00:05:57.950> to<00:05:58.070> you<00:05:59.530> whoo<00:06:02.350> now<00:06:03.350> one<00:06:03.530> thing

00:06:03.700 --> 00:06:03.710 
can compare it to you whoo now one thing

00:06:03.710 --> 00:06:05.800 
can compare it to you whoo now one thing
that<00:06:03.770> people<00:06:04.100> are<00:06:04.400> going<00:06:04.670> to<00:06:04.790> complain<00:06:05.540> about

00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:05.810 
that people are going to complain about

00:06:05.810 --> 00:06:08.410 
that people are going to complain about
is<00:06:06.110> no<00:06:06.800> they<00:06:07.070> don't<00:06:07.220> have<00:06:07.400> the<00:06:07.580> Cosworth<00:06:07.850> sound

00:06:08.410 --> 00:06:08.420 
is no they don't have the Cosworth sound

00:06:08.420 --> 00:06:09.760 
is no they don't have the Cosworth sound
because<00:06:08.690> Cosworth<00:06:09.080> has<00:06:09.290> that<00:06:09.500> sort<00:06:09.680> of

00:06:09.760 --> 00:06:09.770 
because Cosworth has that sort of

00:06:09.770 --> 00:06:11.410 
because Cosworth has that sort of
distinctive<00:06:10.310> sound<00:06:10.550> they<00:06:10.700> really<00:06:11.000> bring<00:06:11.210> out

00:06:11.410 --> 00:06:11.420 
distinctive sound they really bring out

00:06:11.420 --> 00:06:13.930 
distinctive sound they really bring out
the<00:06:11.620> boxer<00:06:12.620> and<00:06:12.710> the<00:06:12.770> boxer<00:06:13.190> motor<00:06:13.430> I<00:06:13.550> guess<00:06:13.820> if

00:06:13.930 --> 00:06:13.940 
the boxer and the boxer motor I guess if

00:06:13.940 --> 00:06:16.540 
the boxer and the boxer motor I guess if
you<00:06:14.030> want<00:06:14.180> to<00:06:14.270> say<00:06:14.620> but<00:06:15.620> let's<00:06:15.830> go<00:06:15.980> ahead<00:06:16.100> and

00:06:16.540 --> 00:06:16.550 
you want to say but let's go ahead and

00:06:16.550 --> 00:06:20.550 
you want to say but let's go ahead and
just<00:06:16.790> get<00:06:17.150> this<00:06:17.330> thing<00:06:17.390> going

00:06:20.550 --> 00:06:20.560 

00:06:20.560 --> 00:06:23.850 

the<00:06:21.560> zero<00:06:21.770> is<00:06:21.860> 16<00:06:22.220> this<00:06:22.340> thing<00:06:22.550> is<00:06:22.790> I<00:06:22.850> believe

00:06:23.850 --> 00:06:23.860 
the zero is 16 this thing is I believe

00:06:23.860 --> 00:06:27.340 
the zero is 16 this thing is I believe
3.7<00:06:24.860> 3.6<00:06:25.430> seconds<00:06:25.850> and<00:06:26.240> I<00:06:26.930> can't<00:06:27.170> drive<00:06:27.260> like

00:06:27.340 --> 00:06:27.350 
3.7 3.6 seconds and I can't drive like

00:06:27.350 --> 00:06:28.930 
3.7 3.6 seconds and I can't drive like
that<00:06:27.500> there<00:06:27.830> we<00:06:27.950> go

00:06:28.930 --> 00:06:28.940 
that there we go

00:06:28.940 --> 00:06:32.440 
that there we go
and<00:06:29.380> no<00:06:30.380> just<00:06:30.710> it's<00:06:31.310> a<00:06:31.430> relatively<00:06:31.820> really

00:06:32.440 --> 00:06:32.450 
and no just it's a relatively really

00:06:32.450 --> 00:06:35.710 
and no just it's a relatively really
fast<00:06:32.720> car<00:06:33.080> interior<00:06:33.740> it<00:06:34.220> does<00:06:34.430> have<00:06:34.720> moderate

00:06:35.710 --> 00:06:35.720 
fast car interior it does have moderate

00:06:35.720 --> 00:06:37.660 
fast car interior it does have moderate
no<00:06:36.110> changes<00:06:36.620> like<00:06:36.740> Cosworth<00:06:37.160> stitching<00:06:37.580> to

00:06:37.660 --> 00:06:37.670 
no changes like Cosworth stitching to

00:06:37.670 --> 00:06:40.000 
no changes like Cosworth stitching to
the<00:06:37.700> seats<00:06:38.000> and<00:06:38.360> like<00:06:38.510> that<00:06:38.540> but<00:06:39.010> you

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:40.010 
the seats and like that but you

00:06:40.010 --> 00:06:41.650 
the seats and like that but you
have<00:06:40.130> to<00:06:40.220> just<00:06:40.430> excuse<00:06:40.850> the<00:06:40.970> driving<00:06:41.300> locks<00:06:41.510> I

00:06:48.340 --> 00:06:48.350 
really don't care but I mean overall

00:06:48.350 --> 00:06:49.930 
really don't care but I mean overall
this<00:06:48.530> is<00:06:48.590> one<00:06:48.890> of<00:06:48.980> those<00:06:49.070> cars<00:06:49.340> to<00:06:49.580> wear<00:06:49.730> if<00:06:49.820> you

00:06:49.930 --> 00:06:49.940 
this is one of those cars to wear if you

00:06:49.940 --> 00:06:51.850 
this is one of those cars to wear if you

00:06:56.950 --> 00:06:56.960 
chances are there's not gonna be another
