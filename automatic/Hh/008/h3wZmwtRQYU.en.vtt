00:04:47.489 --> 00:04:47.499 
happier it's hard to top lifting the

00:04:47.499 --> 00:04:49.950 
happier it's hard to top lifting the
Champions<00:04:47.949> League<00:04:48.009> trophy<00:04:48.249> but<00:04:48.879> this<00:04:49.659> caused

00:04:49.950 --> 00:04:49.960 
Champions League trophy but this caused

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:52.439 
Champions League trophy but this caused
by<00:04:50.229> a<00:04:50.259> close<00:04:50.560> second<00:04:51.009> brilliant<00:04:51.699> feel<00:04:52.120> lucky

00:04:52.439 --> 00:04:52.449 
by a close second brilliant feel lucky

00:04:52.449 --> 00:04:55.140 
by a close second brilliant feel lucky
that<00:04:52.479> he's<00:04:52.779> back<00:04:53.159> 16<00:04:54.159> trophies<00:04:54.610> in<00:04:54.759> the<00:04:54.789> six

00:04:55.140 --> 00:04:55.150 
that he's back 16 trophies in the six

00:04:55.150 --> 00:04:56.939 
that he's back 16 trophies in the six
years<00:04:55.240> since<00:04:55.419> he's<00:04:55.719> not<00:04:55.870> been<00:04:56.080> here<00:04:56.319> but<00:04:56.830> do

00:04:56.939 --> 00:04:56.949 
years since he's not been here but do

00:04:56.949 --> 00:04:59.309 
years since he's not been here but do
you<00:04:57.039> still<00:04:57.310> feel<00:04:57.460> unique<00:04:57.819> continuity<00:04:58.509> I<00:04:58.719> think

00:04:59.309 --> 00:04:59.319 
you still feel unique continuity I think

00:04:59.319 --> 00:05:01.350 
you still feel unique continuity I think
so<00:04:59.469> i<00:04:59.650> think<00:04:59.770> that<00:05:00.159> we<00:05:01.000> could<00:05:01.120> have<00:05:01.210> done

00:05:01.350 --> 00:05:01.360 
so i think that we could have done

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:03.209 
so i think that we could have done
better<00:05:01.539> certainly<00:05:02.409> last<00:05:02.560> season<00:05:02.919> was<00:05:03.039> a<00:05:03.069> bit

00:05:03.209 --> 00:05:03.219 
better certainly last season was a bit

00:05:03.219 --> 00:05:04.409 
better certainly last season was a bit
of<00:05:03.279> a<00:05:03.340> disappointment<00:05:03.610> in<00:05:04.000> a<00:05:04.060> number<00:05:04.300> of<00:05:04.360> ways

00:05:04.409 --> 00:05:04.419 
of a disappointment in a number of ways

00:05:04.419 --> 00:05:07.409 
of a disappointment in a number of ways
i<00:05:04.870> think<00:05:05.770> if<00:05:06.099> we<00:05:06.490> had<00:05:06.639> a<00:05:06.789> bit<00:05:06.969> more<00:05:07.090> continuity

00:05:07.409 --> 00:05:07.419 
i think if we had a bit more continuity

00:05:07.419 --> 00:05:08.850 
i think if we had a bit more continuity
at<00:05:07.659> the<00:05:07.810> last<00:05:07.990> couple<00:05:08.169> of<00:05:08.319> years<00:05:08.379> of<00:05:08.620> in<00:05:08.740> my

00:05:08.850 --> 00:05:08.860 
at the last couple of years of in my

00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:10.469 
at the last couple of years of in my
affair<00:05:09.129> another<00:05:09.430> Premiership<00:05:09.909> yeah

00:05:10.469 --> 00:05:10.479 
affair another Premiership yeah

00:05:10.479 --> 00:05:12.260 
affair another Premiership yeah
absolutely<00:05:10.839> there's<00:05:11.379> been<00:05:11.529> too<00:05:11.710> much<00:05:11.889> change

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:12.270 
absolutely there's been too much change

00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:15.300 
absolutely there's been too much change
and<00:05:13.270> that<00:05:13.839> can<00:05:14.199> only<00:05:14.289> ruffle<00:05:14.740> feathers<00:05:14.889> I<00:05:15.159> mean

00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:15.310 
and that can only ruffle feathers I mean

00:05:15.310 --> 00:05:17.399 
and that can only ruffle feathers I mean
you<00:05:15.789> know<00:05:15.879> look<00:05:16.150> at<00:05:16.270> Alex<00:05:16.599> Ferguson<00:05:17.110> Cyrus

00:05:17.399 --> 00:05:17.409 
you know look at Alex Ferguson Cyrus

00:05:17.409 --> 00:05:18.839 
you know look at Alex Ferguson Cyrus
their<00:05:17.589> eyes<00:05:17.710> folks<00:05:18.009> and<00:05:18.219> success<00:05:18.610> with

00:05:18.839 --> 00:05:18.849 
their eyes folks and success with

00:05:18.849 --> 00:05:21.320 
their eyes folks and success with
Manchester<00:05:19.240> United<00:05:19.300> that<00:05:20.259> comes<00:05:20.650> from

00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:21.330 
Manchester United that comes from

00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:23.909 
Manchester United that comes from
continuity<00:05:22.330> just<00:05:22.900> having<00:05:23.229> something<00:05:23.500> in

00:05:23.909 --> 00:05:23.919 
continuity just having something in

00:05:23.919 --> 00:05:26.429 
continuity just having something in
place<00:05:24.189> which<00:05:24.520> is<00:05:24.759> like<00:05:24.969> a<00:05:25.000> bedrock<00:05:25.449> that's

00:05:26.429 --> 00:05:26.439 
place which is like a bedrock that's

00:05:26.439 --> 00:05:29.100 
place which is like a bedrock that's
what<00:05:26.650> they<00:05:26.830> got<00:05:27.159> with<00:05:27.339> you<00:05:27.550> know<00:05:27.729> Josie<00:05:28.599> and<00:05:28.839> I

00:05:29.100 --> 00:05:29.110 
what they got with you know Josie and I

00:05:29.110 --> 00:05:30.570 
what they got with you know Josie and I
think<00:05:29.259> they'll<00:05:29.379> have<00:05:29.529> that<00:05:29.710> again<00:05:29.949> continuity

00:05:30.570 --> 00:05:30.580 
think they'll have that again continuity

00:05:30.580 --> 00:05:31.950 
think they'll have that again continuity
massively<00:05:30.879> important<00:05:31.210> look<00:05:31.300> you<00:05:31.719> know<00:05:31.839> the

00:05:31.950 --> 00:05:31.960 
massively important look you know the

00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:33.570 
massively important look you know the
club<00:05:32.169> has<00:05:32.349> had<00:05:32.680> a<00:05:32.710> lot<00:05:32.889> of<00:05:32.919> success<00:05:33.279> in<00:05:33.430> one's

00:05:33.570 --> 00:05:33.580 
club has had a lot of success in one's

00:05:33.580 --> 00:05:35.490 
club has had a lot of success in one's
pleased<00:05:33.789> about<00:05:33.939> that<00:05:34.060> but<00:05:34.360> I<00:05:34.750> think<00:05:35.139> if<00:05:35.379> you've

00:05:35.490 --> 00:05:35.500 
pleased about that but I think if you've

00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:38.129 
pleased about that but I think if you've
got<00:05:35.830> success<00:05:36.310> and<00:05:36.520> you've<00:05:37.300> got<00:05:37.419> the<00:05:37.569> support

00:05:38.129 --> 00:05:38.139 
got success and you've got the support

00:05:38.139 --> 00:05:39.540 
got success and you've got the support
the<00:05:38.349> wholehearted<00:05:38.529> support<00:05:38.949> of<00:05:39.279> audio

00:05:39.540 --> 00:05:39.550 
the wholehearted support of audio

00:05:39.550 --> 00:05:42.420 
the wholehearted support of audio
support<00:05:40.120> six<00:05:40.509> that's<00:05:41.080> really<00:05:41.349> good<00:05:41.620> he<00:05:42.250> won

00:05:42.420 --> 00:05:42.430 
support six that's really good he won

00:05:42.430 --> 00:05:44.369 
support six that's really good he won
five<00:05:42.699> major<00:05:43.210> trophies<00:05:43.689> in<00:05:43.870> the<00:05:43.960> three<00:05:44.169> years

00:05:44.369 --> 00:05:44.379 
five major trophies in the three years

00:05:44.379 --> 00:05:46.980 
five major trophies in the three years
he<00:05:44.529> was<00:05:44.560> there<00:05:44.919> sure<00:05:45.430> Daisy<00:05:45.879> is<00:05:46.060> he<00:05:46.300> able<00:05:46.479> to<00:05:46.659> do

00:05:46.980 --> 00:05:46.990 
he was there sure Daisy is he able to do

00:05:46.990 --> 00:05:48.689 
he was there sure Daisy is he able to do
feel<00:05:47.199> he'll<00:05:47.680> be<00:05:47.800> able<00:05:47.889> to<00:05:48.039> replicate<00:05:48.310> that

00:05:48.689 --> 00:05:48.699 
feel he'll be able to replicate that

00:05:48.699 --> 00:05:50.999 
feel he'll be able to replicate that
success<00:05:48.849> I<00:05:49.509> think<00:05:50.080> so<00:05:50.229> if<00:05:50.379> he<00:05:50.469> gets<00:05:50.649> suppliers

00:05:50.999 --> 00:05:51.009 
success I think so if he gets suppliers

00:05:51.009 --> 00:05:52.469 
success I think so if he gets suppliers
he<00:05:51.219> wants<00:05:51.490> and<00:05:51.669> I<00:05:51.849> think<00:05:52.060> he's<00:05:52.149> got<00:05:52.300> a<00:05:52.330> good

00:05:52.469 --> 00:05:52.479 
he wants and I think he's got a good

00:05:52.479 --> 00:05:54.389 
he wants and I think he's got a good
card<00:05:52.719> for<00:05:52.870> a<00:05:52.930> players<00:05:53.199> at<00:05:53.349> the<00:05:53.379> moment<00:05:53.770> they

00:05:54.389 --> 00:05:54.399 
card for a players at the moment they

00:05:54.399 --> 00:05:55.589 
card for a players at the moment they
probably<00:05:54.610> need<00:05:54.819> to<00:05:54.849> make<00:05:55.029> one<00:05:55.180> or<00:05:55.300> two<00:05:55.419> new

00:05:55.589 --> 00:05:55.599 
probably need to make one or two new

00:05:55.599 --> 00:05:57.990 
probably need to make one or two new
signings<00:05:56.050> but<00:05:56.469> when<00:05:57.430> that's<00:05:57.610> done<00:05:57.789> I<00:05:57.849> think

00:05:57.990 --> 00:05:58.000 
signings but when that's done I think

00:05:58.000 --> 00:05:59.490 
signings but when that's done I think
we've<00:05:58.240> got<00:05:58.389> the<00:05:58.479> potential<00:05:58.810> but<00:05:59.050> window<00:05:59.229> and

00:05:59.490 --> 00:05:59.500 
we've got the potential but window and

00:05:59.500 --> 00:06:00.779 
we've got the potential but window and
if<00:05:59.560> your<00:05:59.680> trophies<00:06:00.039> devilish<00:06:00.339> couple<00:06:00.610> used

00:06:00.779 --> 00:06:00.789 
if your trophies devilish couple used

00:06:00.789 --> 00:06:03.929 
if your trophies devilish couple used
he's<00:06:01.210> one<00:06:01.449> of<00:06:01.569> the<00:06:01.689> best<00:06:01.870> managers<00:06:02.789> there<00:06:03.789> is

00:06:03.929 --> 00:06:03.939 
he's one of the best managers there is

00:06:03.939 --> 00:06:06.600 
he's one of the best managers there is
so<00:06:04.659> you<00:06:05.620> know<00:06:05.740> he's<00:06:05.979> been<00:06:06.099> away<00:06:06.250> for<00:06:06.550> a<00:06:06.580> while

00:06:06.600 --> 00:06:06.610 
so you know he's been away for a while

00:06:06.610 --> 00:06:08.189 
so you know he's been away for a while
he's<00:06:07.060> been<00:06:07.300> getting<00:06:07.479> experienced<00:06:08.050> all<00:06:08.110> the

00:06:08.189 --> 00:06:08.199 
he's been getting experienced all the

00:06:08.199 --> 00:06:09.689 
he's been getting experienced all the
time<00:06:08.379> he<00:06:08.529> was<00:06:08.589> massively<00:06:08.979> experience<00:06:09.430> anyway

00:06:09.689 --> 00:06:09.699 
time he was massively experience anyway

00:06:09.699 --> 00:06:12.059 
time he was massively experience anyway
I<00:06:09.879> think<00:06:10.240> half<00:06:10.629> the<00:06:10.659> issue<00:06:11.020> is<00:06:11.469> gaining<00:06:11.889> the

00:06:12.059 --> 00:06:12.069 
I think half the issue is gaining the

00:06:12.069 --> 00:06:14.309 
I think half the issue is gaining the
respect<00:06:12.099> of<00:06:12.789> your<00:06:12.879> players<00:06:13.120> and<00:06:13.509> I<00:06:13.990> think<00:06:14.020> he's

00:06:14.309 --> 00:06:14.319 
respect of your players and I think he's

00:06:14.319 --> 00:06:17.100 
respect of your players and I think he's
got<00:06:14.529> that<00:06:14.740> in<00:06:15.159> in<00:06:15.669> in<00:06:16.029> spades<00:06:16.360> he's<00:06:16.689> always<00:06:16.960> had

00:06:17.100 --> 00:06:17.110 
got that in in in spades he's always had

00:06:17.110 --> 00:06:18.689 
got that in in in spades he's always had
that<00:06:17.289> so<00:06:17.800> I<00:06:17.830> think<00:06:17.979> because<00:06:18.099> he's<00:06:18.430> got<00:06:18.580> that

00:06:18.689 --> 00:06:18.699 
that so I think because he's got that

00:06:18.699 --> 00:06:20.610 
that so I think because he's got that
loyalty<00:06:19.089> I<00:06:19.389> think<00:06:19.659> he<00:06:19.870> will<00:06:20.020> get<00:06:20.139> the<00:06:20.229> best<00:06:20.379> out

00:06:20.610 --> 00:06:20.620 
loyalty I think he will get the best out

00:06:20.620 --> 00:06:22.260 
loyalty I think he will get the best out
of<00:06:20.649> them<00:06:20.919> I<00:06:21.069> think<00:06:21.430> she<00:06:21.490> can<00:06:21.610> engender<00:06:21.879> success

00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:22.270 
of them I think she can engender success

00:06:22.270 --> 00:06:24.820 
of them I think she can engender success
yeah<00:06:22.479> I'm<00:06:22.839> really<00:06:23.620> do<00:06:23.740> think<00:06:23.919> he'll<00:06:24.099> he'll

00:06:24.820 --> 00:06:24.830 
yeah I'm really do think he'll he'll

00:06:24.830 --> 00:06:26.470 
yeah I'm really do think he'll he'll
huge<00:06:25.070> impact<00:06:25.460> that<00:06:25.970> we<00:06:26.090> not<00:06:26.210> won<00:06:26.390> the

00:06:26.470 --> 00:06:26.480 
huge impact that we not won the

00:06:26.480 --> 00:06:28.210 
huge impact that we not won the
Champions<00:06:26.900> League<00:06:26.960> last<00:06:27.260> year<00:06:27.410> we<00:06:27.950> would<00:06:28.100> not

00:06:28.210 --> 00:06:28.220 
Champions League last year we would not

00:06:28.220 --> 00:06:29.350 
Champions League last year we would not
have<00:06:28.370> been<00:06:28.490> at<00:06:28.580> the<00:06:28.670> Champions<00:06:29.060> League<00:06:29.150> this

00:06:31.510 --> 00:06:31.520 
year or for the food get-go and this

00:06:31.520 --> 00:06:33.250 
year or for the food get-go and this
year<00:06:31.550> after<00:06:32.090> you<00:06:32.150> worry<00:06:32.420> about<00:06:32.510> that<00:06:32.660> you<00:06:33.050> know

00:06:33.250 --> 00:06:33.260 
year after you worry about that you know
