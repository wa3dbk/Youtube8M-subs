00:00:36.490 --> 00:00:44.180

 So , for example, other than the video sharing site youtube 

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:49.570
 Uula or 

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:53.530
 Naa has expired I have and butyrate seen 

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:56.500
 So I decided that I could not use it and changed my mind 

00:00:53.530 --> 00:01:00.600
 It is this one this time 

00:00:56.500 --> 00:01:00.600
 Air Mac time capsule Day 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:08.530
 I purchased terabyte stuff for time capsule 

00:01:04.809 --> 00:01:09.909
 It's about time my external hard disk is full, and macbook pro 

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:12.690
 Hey 

00:01:09.909 --> 00:01:16.270
 A sallow another Nde is at all less I 

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:21.820
 I got a single capsule and I got a time capsule 

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:25.630
 So Kedomo is what succumb to this, which immediately opened I want to this time 

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:29.310
 It seems like I have to be very careful when opening 

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:29.310
 When you look at something like a review 

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:40.670
 Please whether out to had been, but like this with a harsh condemnation is when the open of pretty ne box and broom 

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:44.580
 It is better to put this over and over 

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:49.310
 It's kinda scary to wonder if it's good to go above this 

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:49.310
 Let me turn it over and say it out 

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:57.450
 Oh I see it 

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:57.990
 Oh yeah this is something like this It is said that this is a status ride 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:01.140
 Ne 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:03.880
 And beside it without particular nothing 

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:08.890
 Apple mark is on the top 

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:10.530
 The downturn is like this, but it's a little vacant, so the air is getting away 

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:13.980
 The back is 

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:16.569
 Gigabit Ethernet port lan has three with 

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:20.019
 And one usb 2.0 lan terminal 

00:02:16.569 --> 00:02:23.829
 There is one more Gigabit Ethernet waan port . 

00:02:20.019 --> 00:02:28.870
 And this is more than the built-in power adapter part 

00:02:23.829 --> 00:02:29.439
 Very It's heavier than I thought Kedomo is simple it is weight that 1.48kg 

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:31.780
 is not it 

00:02:29.439 --> 00:02:35.400
 It is the bottom of the box 

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:42.360

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:48.600
 Antenna looks like this 

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:52.820
 If it is iphone, it is about 1 or 2 

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:52.820

 So I would like to immediately set the air Mac time capsule 

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:35.300
 That's right , right now it's over with the Mac Utility Case 

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:36.650
 And pretty easy to connect with another ne air mac 

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:42.709
 The rest is 

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:43.489
 ssid just set your own id and password and connection is complete 

00:03:42.709 --> 00:03:46.670
 I just below 

00:03:43.489 --> 00:03:51.620
 Really it was easy but I know me and film 

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:52.250

00:03:52.250 --> 00:04:00.180
 Mac is determined meeting and film I Naa there and over there the real intention Collection 

00:03:56.670 --> 00:04:06.010
 It seems that this will send radio waves in the middle. 

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:10.140
 So it 's clearer than it seems that you can fly strongly and far 

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:10.140
 I would like to do a speed test in the same way 

00:04:13.210 --> 00:04:21.139
 Download 7.69 Mega Upload 

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:24.139

 I was able to see the line and I should have been 

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:50.260

00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:54.740
 If and query and professional customer support chan 

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:57.260

00:04:54.740 --> 00:05:03.620
 Well as that answer 

00:04:57.260 --> 00:05:09.560
 It's a main line, and it's an apartment complex, so it's a wireless lan for other rooms. 

00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:12.710
