twice a day and everything was just

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:30.350 
twice a day and everything was just
really<00:01:28.320> really<00:01:29.040> on<00:01:29.220> point<00:01:29.549> naught<00:01:29.880> naught<00:01:30.149> one

minimum and I think that that really
made<00:01:36.299> a<00:01:36.329> big<00:01:36.509> difference<00:01:36.630> in<00:01:37.020> this<00:01:37.140> a<00:01:37.890> year<00:01:38.219> ago
