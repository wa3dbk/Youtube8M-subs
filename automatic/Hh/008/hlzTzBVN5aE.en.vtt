his<00:02:47.600> game<00:02:47.660> is<00:02:48.170> the<00:02:48.410> three-point<00:02:48.860> shot<00:02:49.130> but<00:02:49.580> I

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:49.790 
his game is the three-point shot but I

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:51.460 
his game is the three-point shot but I
think<00:02:50.030> last<00:02:50.269> year<00:02:50.630> he<00:02:50.750> did<00:02:50.900> a<00:02:50.930> really<00:02:51.260> wise

00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:51.470 
think last year he did a really wise

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:53.590 
think last year he did a really wise
thing<00:02:51.860> he<00:02:51.980> cut<00:02:52.250> way<00:02:52.489> back<00:02:52.519> on<00:02:52.970> his<00:02:53.150> attempts

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:53.600 
thing he cut way back on his attempts

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:56.020 
thing he cut way back on his attempts
and<00:02:54.170> took<00:02:54.500> his<00:02:54.650> game<00:02:54.890> more<00:02:55.130> insight<00:02:55.730> where

00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:56.030 
and took his game more insight where

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:58.640 
and took his game more insight where
he's<00:02:56.239> such<00:02:56.480> a<00:02:56.510> dominant<00:02:57.110> player

00:02:58.640 --> 00:02:58.650 
he's such a dominant player

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:02.809

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:22.009 
three point much of the 30% risk this
game<00:03:19.769> will<00:03:20.069> be<00:03:20.099> built<00:03:20.519> around<00:03:21.659> I<00:03:21.689> think

00:03:22.009 --> 00:03:22.019 
game will be built around I think

00:03:22.019 --> 00:03:24.800 
game will be built around I think
the<00:03:22.230> mid-range<00:03:22.650> jumper<00:03:22.859> on<00:03:23.760> in<00:03:23.970> yeah<00:03:24.510> I<00:03:24.540> agree

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:24.810 
the mid-range jumper on in yeah I agree

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:26.089 
the mid-range jumper on in yeah I agree
with<00:03:25.019> you<00:03:25.230> wholeheartedly<00:03:25.349> I<00:03:25.739> mean<00:03:25.890> that's

00:03:26.089 --> 00:03:26.099 
with you wholeheartedly I mean that's

00:03:26.099 --> 00:03:27.259 
with you wholeheartedly I mean that's
the<00:03:26.250> strength<00:03:26.489> of<00:03:26.640> who<00:03:26.819> he<00:03:26.970> is

00:03:27.259 --> 00:03:27.269 
the strength of who he is

00:03:27.269 --> 00:03:29.390 
the strength of who he is
now<00:03:27.510> the<00:03:27.659> three-point<00:03:28.140> shot<00:03:28.470> could<00:03:28.769> add<00:03:28.980> to

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:29.400 
now the three-point shot could add to

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:31.550 
now the three-point shot could add to
what<00:03:29.579> he<00:03:29.670> does<00:03:29.879> but<00:03:30.180> he's<00:03:30.359> pulling<00:03:30.810> it<00:03:30.959> about

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:31.560 
what he does but he's pulling it about

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:34.429 
what he does but he's pulling it about
205<00:03:32.129> a<00:03:32.189> game<00:03:32.609> without<00:03:32.849> a<00:03:33.540> really<00:03:34.260> poor

00:03:34.429 --> 00:03:34.439 
205 a game without a really poor

00:03:34.439 --> 00:03:36.860 
205 a game without a really poor
three-point<00:03:35.010> shot<00:03:35.310> so<00:03:35.609> maybe<00:03:36.359> that's<00:03:36.599> just

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:36.870 
three-point shot so maybe that's just

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:39.530 
three-point shot so maybe that's just
kind<00:03:37.139> of<00:03:37.319> the<00:03:37.470> chink<00:03:37.799> in<00:03:37.980> his<00:03:38.129> armor<00:03:38.420> but<00:03:39.420> it

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:39.540 
kind of the chink in his armor but it

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:41.240 
kind of the chink in his armor but it
still<00:03:39.780> doesn't<00:03:39.989> keep<00:03:40.200> him<00:03:40.379> from<00:03:40.590> being<00:03:40.980> one<00:03:41.220> of

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:41.250 
still doesn't keep him from being one of

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:44.229 
still doesn't keep him from being one of
the<00:03:41.430> best<00:03:41.609> nap<00:03:41.879> and<00:03:42.629> stay<00:03:43.109> with<00:03:43.530> the<00:03:43.650> ball

00:03:44.229 --> 00:03:44.239 
the best nap and stay with the ball

00:03:44.239 --> 00:03:46.369 
the best nap and stay with the ball
