00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:18.460 
are often performed I decided many years

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:20.460 
are often performed I decided many years
ago<00:01:18.610> that<00:01:19.030> I<00:01:19.420> wouldn't<00:01:19.780> play<00:01:19.960> the<00:01:20.110> Beethoven

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:20.470

00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:25.240 
in a state of revising my own cadenzas

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:38.130

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:41.080 

mozart<00:01:39.140> slow<00:01:39.530> movements<00:01:40.040> are<00:01:40.189> so<00:01:40.490> often<00:01:40.729> on

Dante or Adagio or some other kind of

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:48.399 
Dante or Adagio or some other kind of
generic<00:01:45.710> Italian<00:01:46.340> term<00:01:46.640> it<00:01:47.630> is<00:01:47.689> so<00:01:48.200> refreshing

00:01:48.399 --> 00:01:48.409 
generic Italian term it is so refreshing

00:01:48.409 --> 00:01:51.609 
generic Italian term it is so refreshing
and<00:01:49.070> very<00:01:49.130> telling<00:01:49.820> that<00:01:50.539> in<00:01:50.780> this<00:01:51.049> control

00:01:51.609 --> 00:01:51.619 
and very telling that in this control

00:01:51.619 --> 00:01:53.980 
and very telling that in this control
Mozart<00:01:52.070> chose<00:01:52.610> to<00:01:52.850> call<00:01:53.030> this<00:01:53.210> movement<00:01:53.659> of

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:53.990 
Mozart chose to call this movement of

00:01:53.990 --> 00:02:04.920 
Mozart chose to call this movement of
romance

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:04.930 

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:18.949 

you

00:02:18.949 --> 00:02:18.959 

00:02:18.959 --> 00:02:21.899 

after<00:02:19.959> this<00:02:20.109> romance<00:02:20.769> of<00:02:21.069> a<00:02:21.159> second<00:02:21.519> movement

00:02:21.899 --> 00:02:21.909 
after this romance of a second movement

00:02:21.909 --> 00:02:23.690 
after this romance of a second movement
I<00:02:21.969> think<00:02:22.269> Mozart<00:02:22.450> felt<00:02:22.930> that<00:02:23.139> he<00:02:23.230> needed<00:02:23.409> to

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:23.700 
I think Mozart felt that he needed to

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:26.339 
I think Mozart felt that he needed to
explode<00:02:24.700> into<00:02:25.060> the<00:02:25.180> finale<00:02:25.389> and<00:02:25.810> he<00:02:25.930> did<00:02:26.139> so

00:02:26.339 --> 00:02:26.349 
explode into the finale and he did so

00:02:26.349 --> 00:02:29.190 
explode into the finale and he did so
using<00:02:26.680> a<00:02:26.769> technique<00:02:27.219> that<00:02:28.200> musicologists

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:29.200 
using a technique that musicologists

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:32.459 
using a technique that musicologists
