00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:30.060 
make the process go just a little bit
quicker<00:03:27.930> with<00:03:28.930> the<00:03:28.960> color<00:03:29.320> of<00:03:29.620> your<00:03:29.770> choice

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:30.070 
quicker with the color of your choice

00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:37.160 
quicker with the color of your choice
you<00:03:31.030> will<00:03:31.270> only<00:03:32.160> crochet<00:03:33.160> in<00:03:33.460> the<00:03:34.240> front<00:03:35.250> loop

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:37.170 
you will only crochet in the front loop

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:40.920 
you will only crochet in the front loop
the<00:03:38.170> back<00:03:38.380> loops<00:03:38.770> are<00:03:39.130> for<00:03:39.490> later<00:03:39.670> only<00:03:40.150> the

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:40.930 
the back loops are for later only the

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:43.800 
the back loops are for later only the
front<00:03:41.170> loops<00:03:41.470> all<00:03:41.800> the<00:03:42.010> way<00:03:42.190> around<00:03:42.730> and<00:03:43.060> you

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:43.810 
front loops all the way around and you

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:49.050 
front loops all the way around and you
can<00:03:43.840> go<00:03:44.230> in<00:03:44.440> any<00:03:44.680> loop<00:03:45.990> that<00:03:46.990> you<00:03:47.140> want<00:03:47.790> so<00:03:48.790> just

00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:49.060 
can go in any loop that you want so just

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:54.990 
can go in any loop that you want so just
slip<00:03:49.630> stitch<00:03:50.020> your<00:03:50.560> new<00:03:50.800> color<00:03:51.130> on<00:03:52.470> and<00:03:54.000> you

00:03:54.990 --> 00:03:55.000 
slip stitch your new color on and you

00:03:55.000 --> 00:04:08.460 
slip stitch your new color on and you
chain<00:03:55.360> 5<00:03:55.750> 1<00:03:56.200> 2<00:03:59.340> 3<00:04:03.030> 4<00:04:04.560> 5<00:04:05.560> and<00:04:06.510> you<00:04:07.510> slip<00:04:07.900> stitch<00:04:08.200> in

00:04:08.460 --> 00:04:08.470 
chain 5 1 2 3 4 5 and you slip stitch in

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:13.050 
chain 5 1 2 3 4 5 and you slip stitch in
the<00:04:08.500> very<00:04:08.860> next<00:04:09.580> front<00:04:10.390> loop<00:04:10.800> and<00:04:11.850> that<00:04:12.850> is

00:04:13.050 --> 00:04:13.060 
the very next front loop and that is

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:14.670 
the very next front loop and that is
what<00:04:13.270> you<00:04:13.390> do<00:04:13.570> all<00:04:13.810> the<00:04:13.840> way<00:04:14.080> around<00:04:14.470> this

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:14.680 
what you do all the way around this

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:21.640 
what you do all the way around this
flower<00:04:15.040> chain<00:04:15.760> 5

00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:21.650 

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:29.439 

and<00:04:22.300> slip<00:04:23.300> stitch<00:04:23.330> in<00:04:24.080> the<00:04:24.370> next<00:04:25.370> loop<00:04:28.300> so<00:04:29.300> it's

00:04:29.439 --> 00:04:29.449 
and slip stitch in the next loop so it's

00:04:29.449 --> 00:04:31.420 
and slip stitch in the next loop so it's
very<00:04:29.660> easy<00:04:30.020> once<00:04:30.380> you<00:04:30.530> get<00:04:30.740> to<00:04:30.949> this<00:04:31.100> part

00:04:31.420 --> 00:04:31.430 
very easy once you get to this part

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:34.710 
very easy once you get to this part
because<00:04:31.760> it's<00:04:31.940> the<00:04:32.090> same<00:04:32.330> stitch<00:04:33.340> over<00:04:34.340> and

00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:34.720 
because it's the same stitch over and

00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:39.730 
because it's the same stitch over and
over<00:04:35.720> again<00:04:35.979> okay<00:04:36.979> I'm<00:04:37.070> going<00:04:37.280> to<00:04:37.370> swap<00:04:37.760> out<00:04:38.740> to

00:04:39.730 --> 00:04:39.740 
over again okay I'm going to swap out to

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:48.120 
over again okay I'm going to swap out to
one<00:04:39.949> that<00:04:40.220> I<00:04:40.250> have<00:04:40.669> almost<00:04:41.030> completed<00:04:46.750> and
