00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:01.969 

today<00:00:00.359> I<00:00:00.420> want<00:00:00.570> to<00:00:00.630> talk<00:00:00.810> to<00:00:00.900> you<00:00:00.960> about<00:00:01.050> the<00:00:01.350> 35

00:00:01.969 --> 00:00:01.979 
today I want to talk to you about the 35

00:00:01.979 --> 00:00:03.560 
today I want to talk to you about the 35
mil<00:00:02.310> which<00:00:02.550> is<00:00:02.730> the<00:00:02.879> equivalent<00:00:03.389> of<00:00:03.449> a

00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:03.570 
mil which is the equivalent of a

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:10.150 
mil which is the equivalent of a
standard<00:00:04.049> lens<00:00:04.259> for<00:00:04.620> the<00:00:04.710> Fuji<00:00:05.069> x-pro<00:00:05.370> one

00:00:10.150 --> 00:00:10.160 

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:14.510 

so<00:00:11.160> the<00:00:11.430> 35<00:00:11.850> mil<00:00:12.180> is<00:00:12.480> a<00:00:12.900> 1.4<00:00:13.800> lens<00:00:14.130> it's

00:00:14.510 --> 00:00:14.520 
so the 35 mil is a 1.4 lens it's

00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:16.490 
so the 35 mil is a 1.4 lens it's
beautifully<00:00:15.270> constructed<00:00:15.660> like<00:00:16.080> all<00:00:16.260> of<00:00:16.410> the

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:16.500 
beautifully constructed like all of the

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:18.320 
beautifully constructed like all of the
other<00:00:16.650> lenses<00:00:17.070> it's<00:00:17.220> really<00:00:17.610> nice<00:00:17.789> and<00:00:18.030> small

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:18.330 
other lenses it's really nice and small

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:21.230 
other lenses it's really nice and small

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650 
the square shape which is familiar to

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:16.160 
the square shape which is familiar to
Leica<00:01:14.130> shooters<00:01:14.610> made<00:01:15.000> of<00:01:15.150> metal<00:01:15.509> and<00:01:15.630> it

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
comes with its own cap as well which I

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:20.719 
comes with its own cap as well which I
find<00:01:18.299> really<00:01:18.570> easy<00:01:18.780> cause<00:01:19.470> often<00:01:20.009> I'll<00:01:20.490> have

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
find really easy cause often I'll have

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:21.620 
find really easy cause often I'll have
to<00:01:20.850> be<00:01:20.939> careful<00:01:21.119> with<00:01:21.420> that

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
to be careful with that

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:23.719 
to be careful with that
but<00:01:22.049> then<00:01:22.229> the<00:01:22.380> main<00:01:22.560> lens<00:01:22.829> comes<00:01:23.189> with<00:01:23.460> it

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729 
but then the main lens comes with it

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:26.390 
but then the main lens comes with it
hood<00:01:24.000> as<00:01:24.210> well<00:01:24.240> so<00:01:25.229> taking<00:01:25.680> a<00:01:25.740> close-up<00:01:26.040> you

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 
hood as well so taking a close-up you

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:28.580 
hood as well so taking a close-up you
can<00:01:26.490> see<00:01:26.640> again<00:01:27.240> this<00:01:27.450> one<00:01:27.689> stops<00:01:28.049> all<00:01:28.320> the<00:01:28.350> way

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
can see again this one stops all the way

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:31.609 
can see again this one stops all the way
down<00:01:28.799> for<00:01:29.009> 1.4<00:01:29.790> through<00:01:30.119> to<00:01:30.240> 16<00:01:30.780> and<00:01:31.079> the

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:31.619 
down for 1.4 through to 16 and the

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:33.859 
down for 1.4 through to 16 and the
aperture<00:01:31.950> control<00:01:32.549> is<00:01:32.820> on<00:01:33.030> the<00:01:33.180> lens<00:01:33.390> itself

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:33.869 
aperture control is on the lens itself

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:36.889 
aperture control is on the lens itself
again<00:01:34.770> this<00:01:35.009> is<00:01:35.220> not<00:01:35.460> attached<00:01:36.210> the<00:01:36.540> focus

00:01:36.889 --> 00:01:36.899 
again this is not attached the focus

00:01:36.899 --> 00:01:39.050 
again this is not attached the focus
ring<00:01:37.110> it's<00:01:37.290> not<00:01:37.500> actually<00:01:37.950> shifting<00:01:38.909> the

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:39.060 
ring it's not actually shifting the

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:40.880 
ring it's not actually shifting the
elements<00:01:39.570> when<00:01:39.689> I<00:01:39.720> turn<00:01:40.020> that<00:01:40.229> it's<00:01:40.409> only<00:01:40.590> when

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890 
elements when I turn that it's only when

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:43.060 
elements when I turn that it's only when
you<00:01:41.100> have<00:01:41.310> it<00:01:41.729> attached<00:01:42.030> to<00:01:42.060> the<00:01:42.360> body<00:01:42.540> then<00:01:42.899> it

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:43.070 
you have it attached to the body then it

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:46.010 
you have it attached to the body then it
activates<00:01:44.070> the<00:01:44.189> autofocus<00:01:44.759> motor<00:01:45.180> and<00:01:45.479> that

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
activates the autofocus motor and that

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:48.170 
activates the autofocus motor and that
is<00:01:46.200> shifting<00:01:46.619> the<00:01:46.649> lenses<00:01:47.159> around<00:01:47.460> this<00:01:47.909> one's

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:48.180 
is shifting the lenses around this one's

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:50.359 
is shifting the lenses around this one's
also<00:01:48.479> extremely<00:01:49.290> compact<00:01:49.860> and<00:01:50.130> nicely

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 
also extremely compact and nicely

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:52.850 
also extremely compact and nicely
designed<00:01:50.969> this<00:01:51.390> one<00:01:51.630> has<00:01:51.840> eight<00:01:52.140> elements<00:01:52.710> in

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:52.860 
designed this one has eight elements in

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:55.069 
designed this one has eight elements in
six<00:01:53.250> groups<00:01:53.610> and<00:01:53.850> one<00:01:54.030> of<00:01:54.180> them's<00:01:54.360> a<00:01:54.509> spherical

00:01:55.069 --> 00:01:55.079 
six groups and one of them's a spherical

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:58.010 
six groups and one of them's a spherical
and<00:01:55.259> this<00:01:55.829> one<00:01:56.040> only<00:01:56.369> weighs<00:01:56.600> 187<00:01:57.600> grams<00:01:57.840> so

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020 
and this one only weighs 187 grams so

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:00.530 
and this one only weighs 187 grams so
again<00:01:58.350> it<00:01:58.530> feels<00:01:58.740> nicely<00:01:59.640> constructed<00:01:59.820> and

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:00.540 
again it feels nicely constructed and

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:02.719 
again it feels nicely constructed and
the<00:02:00.630> weight<00:02:00.810> is<00:02:00.990> evenly<00:02:01.439> balanced<00:02:02.070> but<00:02:02.520> it's

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:02.729 
the weight is evenly balanced but it's

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:05.270 
the weight is evenly balanced but it's
reasonably<00:02:03.210> light<00:02:03.570> and<00:02:03.930> I've<00:02:04.500> found<00:02:04.829> this<00:02:04.979> one

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:05.280 
reasonably light and I've found this one

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:07.010 
reasonably light and I've found this one
to<00:02:05.640> have<00:02:05.850> very<00:02:06.210> little<00:02:06.390> in<00:02:06.659> the<00:02:06.750> way<00:02:06.780> of

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:07.020 
to have very little in the way of

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:09.139 
to have very little in the way of
distortion<00:02:07.710> and<00:02:07.740> it's<00:02:08.250> lovely<00:02:08.580> and<00:02:08.820> sharp

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:09.149 
distortion and it's lovely and sharp

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:11.600 
distortion and it's lovely and sharp
