hour and you can you can pretty much

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:18.520 
hour and you can you can pretty much
almost<00:01:17.270> do<00:01:17.570> that<00:01:17.750> when<00:01:17.930> you're<00:01:18.050> full<00:01:18.229> of<00:01:18.350> water

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:18.530 
almost do that when you're full of water

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:20.710 
almost do that when you're full of water
also<00:01:18.800> because<00:01:19.580> the<00:01:19.729> truck<00:01:19.940> has<00:01:20.180> the<00:01:20.420> carrying

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:24.110 
capacity man the wheels do also so you

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:26.499 
capacity man the wheels do also so you
can<00:01:24.500> go<00:01:24.680> rather<00:01:25.460> than<00:01:25.610> limp<00:01:26.030> into<00:01:26.149> the<00:01:26.300> field

00:01:26.499 --> 00:01:26.509 
can go rather than limp into the field

00:01:26.509 --> 00:01:28.719 
can go rather than limp into the field
you<00:01:26.750> can<00:01:26.899> really<00:01:27.170> you<00:01:27.590> know<00:01:27.680> kind<00:01:28.429> of<00:01:28.460> cruise

00:01:28.719 --> 00:01:28.729 
you can really you know kind of cruise

you can really you know kind of cruise
and<00:01:29.060> you'll<00:01:29.690> get<00:01:29.810> to<00:01:29.929> the<00:01:29.960> field<00:01:30.140> and<00:01:30.289> get<00:01:30.440> it

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:30.530 
and you'll get to the field and get it

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:33.430 
and you'll get to the field and get it
done<00:01:30.710> before<00:01:30.740> the<00:01:31.130> weather<00:01:31.310> turns<00:01:31.700> and<00:01:32.440> that's

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:25.660 
we can put on this one what about
getting<00:02:22.940> stuck<00:02:23.360> is<00:02:23.540> it<00:02:23.690> for<00:02:23.900> real<00:02:24.250> it<00:02:25.250> is<00:02:25.430> not

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:25.670 
getting stuck is it for real it is not

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:28.960 
getting stuck is it for real it is not
four<00:02:26.000> wheel<00:02:26.150> drive<00:02:26.450> but<00:02:27.019> we<00:02:27.709> don't<00:02:27.920> see<00:02:28.790> the

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:28.970 
four wheel drive but we don't see the

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:32.289 
four wheel drive but we don't see the
need<00:02:29.209> for<00:02:30.079> or<00:02:30.200> four<00:02:30.350> wheel<00:02:30.530> drive<00:02:31.000> this<00:02:32.000> one<00:02:32.269> of

00:02:32.289 --> 00:02:32.299 
need for or four wheel drive this one of

00:02:32.299 --> 00:02:35.380 
need for or four wheel drive this one of
course<00:02:32.420> has<00:02:32.959> the<00:02:32.989> tandem<00:02:33.530> axle<00:02:34.120> so<00:02:35.120> you<00:02:35.209> can

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:35.390 
course has the tandem axle so you can

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:41.289 
course has the tandem axle so you can
you<00:02:35.660> can<00:02:35.810> lock<00:02:36.079> that<00:02:36.110> in<00:02:37.150> and<00:02:39.820> we<00:02:40.820> always<00:02:41.030> say

00:02:41.289 --> 00:02:41.299 
you can lock that in and we always say

00:02:41.299 --> 00:02:42.729 
you can lock that in and we always say
with<00:02:41.540> four-wheel<00:02:41.840> drive<00:02:42.079> you<00:02:42.260> news<00:02:42.470> you<00:02:42.590> just

00:02:42.729 --> 00:02:42.739 
with four-wheel drive you news you just

00:02:42.739 --> 00:02:45.460 
with four-wheel drive you news you just
need<00:02:42.890> a<00:02:42.920> longer<00:02:43.160> rope<00:02:43.430> to<00:02:43.579> get<00:02:43.670> you<00:02:43.850> out<00:02:43.970> so<00:02:44.470> it

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:45.470 
need a longer rope to get you out so it

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:47.680 
need a longer rope to get you out so it
just<00:02:45.500> gets<00:02:45.829> you<00:02:45.950> further<00:02:46.130> stuck<00:02:46.519> in<00:02:46.760> but<00:02:47.570> it

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:47.690 
just gets you further stuck in but it

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:50.229 
just gets you further stuck in but it
does<00:02:48.140> have<00:02:48.410> good<00:02:48.950> flotation<00:02:49.640> how<00:02:50.180> the

00:02:50.229 --> 00:02:50.239 
does have good flotation how the

00:02:50.239 --> 00:02:51.729 
does have good flotation how the
clearance<00:02:50.900> on

00:02:51.729 --> 00:02:51.739 
clearance on

00:02:51.739 --> 00:02:54.890 
clearance on
the<00:02:52.739> clearance<00:02:53.129> on<00:02:53.219> the<00:02:53.340> booms<00:02:53.810> ranges<00:02:54.810> from

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:54.900 
the clearance on the booms ranges from

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:58.309 
the clearance on the booms ranges from
20<00:02:55.349> inches<00:02:55.829> to<00:02:56.480> six<00:02:57.480> and<00:02:57.629> a<00:02:57.659> half<00:02:57.719> seven<00:02:58.109> feet

00:02:58.309 --> 00:02:58.319 
20 inches to six and a half seven feet

00:02:58.319 --> 00:03:00.979 
20 inches to six and a half seven feet
high<00:02:58.349> and<00:02:58.859> then<00:02:59.519> clearance<00:03:00.480> on<00:03:00.599> the<00:03:00.719> unit

00:03:00.979 --> 00:03:00.989 
high and then clearance on the unit

00:03:00.989 --> 00:03:04.099 
high and then clearance on the unit
itself<00:03:01.109> is<00:03:01.650> about<00:03:01.769> 30<00:03:02.189> inches<00:03:02.719> of<00:03:03.719> clearance

00:03:04.099 --> 00:03:04.109 
itself is about 30 inches of clearance

00:03:04.109 --> 00:03:06.140 
itself is about 30 inches of clearance
so<00:03:04.439> you<00:03:04.530> can<00:03:04.680> do<00:03:04.829> a<00:03:05.129> lot<00:03:05.400> of<00:03:05.519> the<00:03:05.579> small<00:03:05.819> grains

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:06.150 
so you can do a lot of the small grains

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:08.360 
so you can do a lot of the small grains
with<00:03:06.420> it<00:03:06.569> we've<00:03:07.379> got<00:03:07.500> a<00:03:07.530> lot<00:03:07.680> of<00:03:07.709> guys<00:03:07.920> doing<00:03:08.250> in

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:08.370 
with it we've got a lot of guys doing in

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:11.050 
with it we've got a lot of guys doing in
crop<00:03:08.700> and<00:03:08.970> fungicide<00:03:09.540> with<00:03:09.750> it<00:03:09.930> we<00:03:10.590> do<00:03:10.769> have

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:11.060 
crop and fungicide with it we do have

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:13.789 
crop and fungicide with it we do have
shields<00:03:12.060> that<00:03:12.180> we<00:03:12.269> can<00:03:12.390> put<00:03:12.540> underneath<00:03:12.810> the

00:03:13.789 --> 00:03:13.799 
shields that we can put underneath the

00:03:13.799 --> 00:03:17.089 
shields that we can put underneath the
unit<00:03:14.129> itself<00:03:14.220> to<00:03:14.849> help<00:03:15.780> with<00:03:16.079> in<00:03:16.500> crops<00:03:16.799> brain

00:03:17.089 --> 00:03:17.099 
unit itself to help with in crops brain

00:03:17.099 --> 00:03:20.270 
unit itself to help with in crops brain
and<00:03:17.909> so<00:03:18.180> about<00:03:18.659> the<00:03:18.840> booms<00:03:19.139> there<00:03:19.500> they're<00:03:20.099> all

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:20.280 
and so about the booms there they're all

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:22.640 
and so about the booms there they're all
covered<00:03:20.909> how<00:03:21.120> do<00:03:21.180> you<00:03:21.359> describe<00:03:21.810> that<00:03:22.109> in<00:03:22.170> why

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:22.650 
covered how do you describe that in why

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:25.039 
covered how do you describe that in why
why<00:03:23.219> do<00:03:23.280> you<00:03:23.430> have<00:03:23.609> that<00:03:23.790> covered<00:03:24.180> well<00:03:24.810> it's

00:03:25.039 --> 00:03:25.049 
why do you have that covered well it's

00:03:25.049 --> 00:03:28.160 
why do you have that covered well it's
we<00:03:25.680> call<00:03:25.889> it<00:03:26.010> a<00:03:26.069> box<00:03:26.220> boom<00:03:26.519> and<00:03:26.989> it<00:03:27.989> actually

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:28.170 
we call it a box boom and it actually

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:30.649 
we call it a box boom and it actually
gives<00:03:28.530> us<00:03:28.829> more<00:03:29.159> strength<00:03:29.609> and<00:03:29.939> so<00:03:30.180> we<00:03:30.299> can<00:03:30.450> go

00:03:30.649 --> 00:03:30.659 
gives us more strength and so we can go

00:03:30.659 --> 00:03:34.550 
gives us more strength and so we can go
longer<00:03:31.200> distances<00:03:31.980> like<00:03:33.019> our<00:03:34.019> biggest<00:03:34.200> boom

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:34.560 
longer distances like our biggest boom

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:38.300 
longer distances like our biggest boom
right<00:03:34.829> now<00:03:35.040> is<00:03:35.189> 160<00:03:36.000> feet<00:03:36.919> we've<00:03:37.919> got<00:03:38.099> guys

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:38.310 
right now is 160 feet we've got guys

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:41.720 
right now is 160 feet we've got guys
want<00:03:38.700> us<00:03:38.879> to<00:03:39.060> do<00:03:39.319> larger<00:03:40.319> like<00:03:40.620> 180<00:03:41.220> feet<00:03:41.459> and

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:41.730 
want us to do larger like 180 feet and

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:44.659 
want us to do larger like 180 feet and
the<00:03:42.450> reason<00:03:42.900> for<00:03:43.139> it<00:03:43.590> be<00:03:43.739> in<00:03:43.829> the<00:03:43.889> box<00:03:44.159> is<00:03:44.489> like

00:03:44.659 --> 00:03:44.669 
the reason for it be in the box is like

00:03:44.669 --> 00:03:47.300 
the reason for it be in the box is like
I<00:03:44.700> said<00:03:44.939> it's<00:03:45.090> given<00:03:45.359> strength<00:03:45.859> for<00:03:46.859> for<00:03:47.189> when

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:47.310 
I said it's given strength for for when

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:50.330 
I said it's given strength for for when
the<00:03:47.400> boom<00:03:47.549> is<00:03:47.730> twisting<00:03:48.859> and<00:03:49.859> it<00:03:50.129> just

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:50.340 
the boom is twisting and it just

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:52.610 
the boom is twisting and it just
protects<00:03:50.730> everything<00:03:51.120> inside<00:03:51.510> you<00:03:52.319> know<00:03:52.439> is

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:52.620 
protects everything inside you know is

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:55.280 
protects everything inside you know is
for<00:03:52.919> that<00:03:53.099> instance<00:03:53.549> when<00:03:53.760> you<00:03:53.959> do<00:03:54.959> hit<00:03:55.169> the

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:55.290 
for that instance when you do hit the

00:03:55.290 --> 00:03:57.289 
for that instance when you do hit the
ground<00:03:55.519> you're<00:03:56.519> not<00:03:56.669> going<00:03:56.790> to<00:03:56.849> break<00:03:57.000> a<00:03:57.060> bunch

00:03:57.289 --> 00:03:57.299 
ground you're not going to break a bunch

00:03:57.299 --> 00:03:58.520 
ground you're not going to break a bunch
of<00:03:57.389> nozzles<00:03:57.780> off<00:03:57.900> everything's<00:03:58.379> inside

00:03:58.520 --> 00:03:58.530 
of nozzles off everything's inside

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:01.969 
of nozzles off everything's inside
protected<00:03:59.930> so<00:04:00.930> that's<00:04:01.109> the<00:04:01.319> benefit<00:04:01.680> of<00:04:01.739> it

00:04:01.969 --> 00:04:01.979 
protected so that's the benefit of it

00:04:01.979 --> 00:04:04.009 
protected so that's the benefit of it
and<00:04:02.190> it's<00:04:02.280> it's<00:04:02.909> all<00:04:03.090> aluminum<00:04:03.359> it's

00:04:04.009 --> 00:04:04.019 
and it's it's all aluminum it's

00:04:04.019 --> 00:04:08.210 
and it's it's all aluminum it's
lightweight<00:04:05.540> one<00:04:06.540> side<00:04:06.840> weighs<00:04:07.199> about<00:04:07.440> 700

00:04:08.210 --> 00:04:08.220 
lightweight one side weighs about 700

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:11.330 
lightweight one side weighs about 700
pounds<00:04:08.639> per<00:04:08.940> side<00:04:09.209> depending<00:04:09.989> on<00:04:10.440> length<00:04:11.129> of

00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:11.340 
pounds per side depending on length of

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:12.940 
pounds per side depending on length of
boom<00:04:11.489> of<00:04:11.609> course

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:12.950 
boom of course

00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:15.850 
boom of course
so<00:04:13.340> if<00:04:14.270> I<00:04:14.450> made<00:04:14.660> a<00:04:14.690> fence<00:04:14.989> post<00:04:15.110> or<00:04:15.500> something

00:04:15.850 --> 00:04:15.860 
so if I made a fence post or something

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:17.470 
so if I made a fence post or something
with<00:04:16.010> one<00:04:16.250> of<00:04:16.370> the<00:04:16.459> booms<00:04:16.700> it's<00:04:16.910> unlikely<00:04:17.299> that

00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:17.480 
with one of the booms it's unlikely that

00:04:17.480 --> 00:04:20.050 
with one of the booms it's unlikely that
all<00:04:17.690> injured<00:04:18.139> the<00:04:18.260> blue<00:04:18.440> just<00:04:18.769> the<00:04:18.889> fence<00:04:19.130> yeah

00:04:20.050 --> 00:04:20.060 
all injured the blue just the fence yeah

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:22.629 
all injured the blue just the fence yeah
well<00:04:20.510> you<00:04:20.690> might<00:04:21.109> dent<00:04:21.410> up<00:04:21.590> the<00:04:21.650> aluminum<00:04:22.280> but

00:04:22.629 --> 00:04:22.639 
well you might dent up the aluminum but

00:04:22.639 --> 00:04:24.640 
well you might dent up the aluminum but
it's<00:04:23.540> unlikely<00:04:23.810> they're<00:04:24.139> going<00:04:24.260> to<00:04:24.320> break<00:04:24.500> the

00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:24.650

fence all our sections are bolted

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:33.190 
fence all our sections are bolted
together<00:04:31.310> so<00:04:32.030> you<00:04:32.090> can<00:04:32.300> actually<00:04:32.479> just<00:04:32.690> unbolt

00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:33.200 
together so you can actually just unbolt

00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:35.170

00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:38.540 
to repair it and then just then you got

00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:40.719 
to repair it and then just then you got
a<00:04:38.570> new<00:04:38.720> boom<00:04:38.900> again<00:04:39.169> and<00:04:39.380> keep<00:04:39.500> going<00:04:39.680> so<00:04:40.610> what

00:04:40.719 --> 00:04:40.729 
a new boom again and keep going so what

00:04:40.729 --> 00:04:42.580 
a new boom again and keep going so what
about<00:04:40.820> the<00:04:41.030> nozzles<00:04:41.600> on<00:04:41.780> this<00:04:41.990> fray<00:04:42.260> or<00:04:42.290> what

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:42.590 
about the nozzles on this fray or what

00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:45.010 
about the nozzles on this fray or what
kind<00:04:42.770> of<00:04:42.860> water<00:04:43.070> believe<00:04:43.490> can<00:04:43.700> we<00:04:43.820> get<00:04:44.020> these

00:04:45.010 --> 00:04:45.020 
kind of water believe can we get these

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:47.409 
kind of water believe can we get these
we<00:04:45.320> use<00:04:45.530> they're<00:04:46.220> called<00:04:46.520> a<00:04:46.669> very<00:04:46.940> target

00:04:47.409 --> 00:04:47.419 
we use they're called a very target

we use they're called a very target
nozzle<00:04:47.900> from<00:04:48.410> spray<00:04:48.650> target<00:04:49.100> they're<00:04:50.000> good

00:04:50.230 --> 00:04:50.240 
nozzle from spray target they're good

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:54.120

from five to forty gallons per acre at
virtually<00:04:55.130> any<00:04:55.280> speed<00:04:55.610> you<00:04:55.639> can<00:04:55.850> spray<00:04:56.120> at

00:04:56.320 --> 00:04:56.330 
virtually any speed you can spray at

virtually any speed you can spray at
which<00:04:57.260> is<00:04:57.470> good<00:04:57.710> with<00:04:57.860> this<00:04:58.040> truck<00:04:58.340> like<00:04:59.060> I

00:04:59.080 --> 00:04:59.090 
which is good with this truck like I

00:04:59.090 --> 00:05:01.800 
which is good with this truck like I
said<00:04:59.210> spraying<00:04:59.720> with<00:04:59.960> that<00:05:00.260> 20<00:05:00.979> miles<00:05:01.130> an<00:05:01.310> hour

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:01.810 
said spraying with that 20 miles an hour

00:05:01.810 --> 00:05:04.540 
said spraying with that 20 miles an hour
and<00:05:02.810> there's<00:05:03.110> different<00:05:03.500> different<00:05:04.220> colored

00:05:04.540 --> 00:05:04.550 
and there's different different colored

00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:06.159 
and there's different different colored
caps<00:05:04.940> that<00:05:05.210> give<00:05:05.330> you<00:05:05.419> different<00:05:05.570> droplet

00:05:06.159 --> 00:05:06.169 
caps that give you different droplet

00:05:06.169 --> 00:05:09.340 
caps that give you different droplet
sizes<00:05:07.090> so<00:05:08.090> you<00:05:08.120> seem<00:05:08.510> pretty<00:05:08.720> consistent

00:05:09.340 --> 00:05:09.350 
sizes so you seem pretty consistent

00:05:09.350 --> 00:05:10.050 
sizes so you seem pretty consistent
droplets

00:05:10.050 --> 00:05:10.060 
droplets

00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:13.570 
droplets
yes<00:05:11.060> with<00:05:11.420> the<00:05:11.540> nozzle<00:05:11.690> pretty<00:05:12.470> much<00:05:12.650> whatever

00:05:13.570 --> 00:05:13.580 
yes with the nozzle pretty much whatever

00:05:13.580 --> 00:05:15.670 
yes with the nozzle pretty much whatever
speed<00:05:14.030> you're<00:05:14.150> doing<00:05:14.510> it<00:05:15.200> stays<00:05:15.470> pretty

00:05:15.670 --> 00:05:15.680 
speed you're doing it stays pretty

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:17.470 
speed you're doing it stays pretty
consistent<00:05:16.340> and<00:05:16.520> then<00:05:16.880> you<00:05:16.970> can<00:05:17.120> switch<00:05:17.360> them

00:05:17.470 --> 00:05:17.480 
consistent and then you can switch them

00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:19.810 
consistent and then you can switch them
out<00:05:17.630> to<00:05:17.900> get<00:05:18.500> a<00:05:18.530> finer<00:05:18.830> droplet<00:05:19.340> size<00:05:19.580> or

00:05:19.810 --> 00:05:19.820 
out to get a finer droplet size or

00:05:19.820 --> 00:05:22.630 
out to get a finer droplet size or
coarser<00:05:20.240> droplet<00:05:20.600> size<00:05:20.810> according<00:05:21.800> to<00:05:21.980> what

00:05:22.630 --> 00:05:22.640 
coarser droplet size according to what

00:05:22.640 --> 00:05:24.460 
coarser droplet size according to what
you're<00:05:22.790> spraying<00:05:22.970> and<00:05:23.390> you<00:05:23.630> fit<00:05:23.990> a<00:05:24.020> higher

00:05:24.460 --> 00:05:24.470 
you're spraying and you fit a higher

00:05:24.470 --> 00:05:27.550 
you're spraying and you fit a higher
