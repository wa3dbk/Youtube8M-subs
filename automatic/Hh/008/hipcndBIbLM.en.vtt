 owners of delicious rolls and 

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:11.040

 the chicken and egg blast is about right 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:24.289
 nutrition 

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:33.430
 the most important balanced nutrition 

00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:36.070
 this is the correct ratio of fat proteins 

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:37.210
 and carbohydrates in short carbohydrates and fats it 

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:39.760
 energy sources 

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:41.410
 abilty building material all three 

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:43.720

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:45.400
 diet and diets which insists not 

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:48.770
 exclusion of one of these nutrients 

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:51.050
 worth ignoring but better burn 

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:53.870
 classic ratio would live it 

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:58.010
 one part fat one part protein and 4 

00:00:53.870 --> 00:01:00.340
 part carbohydrate or 56 percent ku31 

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:02.930
 percent same and whose 30 percent b 

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:05.180
 depending on the goals of preferences can 

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:06.979
 to play with fonts i.e. interest but 

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:09.410
 It is not recommended to lower the bar and 

00:01:06.979 --> 00:01:11.960
 carbohydrates below 40 percent and fat below 

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:13.880
 15 mindlessly losing weight you will be fat 

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:15.979
 the status of the main enemy though 

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:17.810
 fat doesn't make you fat its trouble 

00:01:15.979 --> 00:01:19.550
 Only that one gram of fat in two 

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:20.240
 calories more than a gram of protein or 

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:22.460
 carbohydrate 

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:24.800
 unsaturated fats that can be found in 

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:27.050
 avocado olive oil and nuts are beneficial 

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:29.119
 and lower cholesterol about which 

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:30.200
 You must have heard from the 40-year-old heroes 

00:01:29.119 --> 00:01:32.450
 american comedies 

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:33.979
 and the necessary omega-3 fats are not at all 

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:36.080
 synthesized in our body 

00:01:33.979 --> 00:01:38.600
 but in sufficient quantities 

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:39.759
 salmon and with a rug and day oil here 

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:41.899
 animal fats 

00:01:39.759 --> 00:01:43.310
 really need to be careful and 

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:45.020
 try not to use the more 

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:47.869
 thirds of the daily fat 

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:49.759
 to understand what you really eat 

00:01:47.869 --> 00:01:52.310
 better to give up 

00:01:49.759 --> 00:01:55.300
 processed products and semi-finished products 

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:58.819
 buy raw meat fresh vegetables fruit 

00:01:55.300 --> 00:02:00.229
 cereals sausage is tasty especially when 

00:01:58.819 --> 00:02:02.929
 she is in a sandwich bottom 

00:02:00.229 --> 00:02:05.390
 but it has very little meat but generously chick 

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:07.340
 on fats and dyes more so if 

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:09.440
 view price tag per kilo chicken and kilo 

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:11.330
 saverlata then it becomes clear that you 

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:14.270
 make the right choice when you choose 

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:16.130
 Kalba chicken but also the purchase of useful 

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:18.230
 products are not a guarantee of success because 

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:20.180
 they can always spoil way 

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:22.490
 cooking namely hot 

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:24.349
 vegetable oil when heated produces 

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:26.390
 all the nastiness and also significantly 

00:02:24.349 --> 00:02:28.430
 increases the calorie bore 

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:30.319
 researchers say that because of the high 

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:32.420
 temperature when frying products loses 

00:02:30.319 --> 00:02:34.880
 more vitamins than cooking and parks 

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:38.480
 but do not rush to extremes if not 

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:40.430
 the oven from boiled you can be turned back 

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:42.200
 use a grill or pan with 

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:44.870
 non-stick coated and fried on 

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:47.209
 low heat without oil I tried it 

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:49.069
 works you must have heard that 

00:02:47.209 --> 00:02:51.319
 it is recommended to eat often and small 

00:02:49.069 --> 00:02:53.090
 portions but actually effectiveness 

00:02:51.319 --> 00:02:55.040
 this technique is not proven important not 

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:57.350
 the number of servings per day and the fact that 

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:59.060
 It turns out if you are comfortable 

00:02:57.350 --> 00:03:00.920
 eat 3 times a day 

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:02.900
 torture yourself and change the mode but fractional 

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:05.239
 there are food and its advantages because 

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:06.950
 less break between name meals 

00:03:05.239 --> 00:03:09.410
 hunger is likely to occur 

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:11.720
 which is especially important if you lose weight 

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:13.430
 if the goal is to build muscle yes more 

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:15.410
 better still increase the amount 

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:16.130
 servings because for pushing yourself three 

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:18.310
 food basin 

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:21.349
 much more complicated than 67 saucepans 

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:23.750
 sweets are not taboo if you like 

00:03:21.349 --> 00:03:25.640
 Pirozhenko life without it is not sweet shiver 

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:26.450
 pens jerks to iron then eat 

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:28.849
 cake 

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:30.890
 but wisely fast carbs dramatically 

00:03:28.849 --> 00:03:32.750
 raises blood sugar levels and if 

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:34.340
 do not have time to spend them also 

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:36.769
 quickly deposited in your piggy bank 

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:39.049
 body from there to fat on your piggy bank 

00:03:36.769 --> 00:03:41.330
 so it is logical to use fast 

00:03:39.049 --> 00:03:43.790
 carbohydrates when your activity at its peak 

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:46.790
 ideally up to playing sports but to the extreme 

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:49.069
 case in the morning to 12 days 

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:49.940
 You can safely eat candy or 

00:03:49.069 --> 00:03:52.069
 small cupcake 

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:54.290
 little ones say it actually 

00:03:52.069 --> 00:03:56.360
 full-size cake for the same reason 

00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:58.370
 most of the complex carbohydrates and fats 

00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:59.060
 also recommended to use first 

00:03:58.370 --> 00:04:01.190
 half day 

00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:02.959
 why do you need energy before bed to 

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:06.440
 tossing and turning in bed more intensely 

00:04:02.959 --> 00:04:09.230
