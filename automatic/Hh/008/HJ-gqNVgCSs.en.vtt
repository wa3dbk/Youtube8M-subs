00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:47.170 
and we put the the front pulley on that

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:50.470 
and we put the the front pulley on that
ran<00:00:48.170> it<00:00:48.320> down<00:00:48.520> use<00:00:49.520> just<00:00:49.790> a<00:00:49.880> couple<00:00:49.910> of<00:00:50.180> uh

mod that I did another rigging that we
did<00:01:23.990> installed<00:01:24.800> a<00:01:24.890> couple<00:01:25.159> pieces<00:01:25.310> of<00:01:25.520> gear

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:25.940 
did installed a couple pieces of gear

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:28.960 
did installed a couple pieces of gear
track<00:01:26.210> just<00:01:26.930> short<00:01:27.200> I<00:01:27.530> believe<00:01:28.250> it's<00:01:28.400> a<00:01:28.520> 4-inch

right side of the boat I use typically

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:38.200 
right side of the boat I use typically
to<00:01:35.390> mount<00:01:35.690> my<00:01:36.110> busy<00:01:36.530> pole<00:01:36.710> on<00:01:37.159> being<00:01:38.060> out<00:01:38.180> on

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:20.660 
water one of the bigger installs I did

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:21.100 
water one of the bigger installs I did
was

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:21.110 
was

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:23.320 
was
adding<00:02:21.440> the<00:02:21.530> fishfinder<00:02:21.740> and<00:02:22.310> I<00:02:22.730> added<00:02:23.030> a

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:23.330 
adding the fishfinder and I added a

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:26.920

hummingbird 170 and you can see here the

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:29.620 
hummingbird 170 and you can see here the
mount<00:02:27.140> options<00:02:27.680> we<00:02:28.640> did<00:02:28.790> a<00:02:28.850> mighty<00:02:29.090> mount<00:02:29.360> for

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:29.630 
mount options we did a mighty mount for

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:36.340 
mount options we did a mighty mount for
the<00:02:29.690> base<00:02:30.370> used<00:02:31.370> a<00:02:31.580> short<00:02:33.430> extender<00:02:35.320> with<00:02:36.320> a

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:36.350 
the base used a short extender with a

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:39.040 
the base used a short extender with a
ball<00:02:36.890> mount<00:02:37.160> to<00:02:37.430> the<00:02:38.030> hummingbird<00:02:38.450> mount<00:02:38.750> and

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:39.050 
ball mount to the hummingbird mount and

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:40.570 
ball mount to the hummingbird mount and
then<00:02:39.410> the<00:02:39.500> hummingbird<00:02:39.860> on<00:02:40.010> there<00:02:40.250> and<00:02:40.490> the

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:40.580 
then the hummingbird on there and the

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:42.070 
then the hummingbird on there and the
nice<00:02:40.790> thing<00:02:40.820> about<00:02:41.000> this<00:02:41.330> is<00:02:41.600> you<00:02:41.780> know<00:02:41.870> it

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:42.080 
nice thing about this is you know it

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:45.400 
nice thing about this is you know it
really<00:02:42.590> lets<00:02:42.770> you<00:02:42.950> go<00:02:43.720> there<00:02:44.720> infinite

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:45.410 
really lets you go there infinite

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:47.140 
really lets you go there infinite
different<00:02:45.950> angles<00:02:46.460> that<00:02:46.520> you<00:02:46.610> can<00:02:46.700> place<00:02:46.970> the

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:47.150 
different angles that you can place the

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:49.930 
different angles that you can place the
fish<00:02:47.330> finder<00:02:47.540> at<00:02:48.070> never<00:02:49.070> once<00:02:49.340> had<00:02:49.580> it<00:02:49.700> in<00:02:49.790> my

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:49.940 
fish finder at never once had it in my

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:53.050 
fish finder at never once had it in my
way<00:02:50.120> it's<00:02:50.570> always<00:02:50.780> worked<00:02:51.110> very<00:02:51.590> well<00:02:51.850> as<00:02:52.850> far

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:53.060 
way it's always worked very well as far

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:56.340 
way it's always worked very well as far
as<00:02:53.090> the<00:02:53.300> wires<00:02:53.560> for<00:02:54.560> the<00:02:54.620> the<00:02:55.340> fish<00:02:55.520> finder<00:02:55.760> I

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:56.350 
as the wires for the the fish finder I

00:02:56.350 --> 00:02:59.530 
as the wires for the the fish finder I
ran<00:02:57.350> them<00:02:57.530> through<00:02:57.560> the<00:02:58.040> top<00:02:58.400> of<00:02:58.430> the<00:02:58.610> hole<00:02:58.790> and

00:02:59.530 --> 00:02:59.540 
ran them through the top of the hole and

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:00.640 
ran them through the top of the hole and
I'll<00:02:59.660> back<00:02:59.810> up<00:02:59.870> a<00:03:00.080> little<00:03:00.170> bit<00:03:00.350> just<00:03:00.500> so<00:03:00.560> you

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:00.650 
I'll back up a little bit just so you

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:02.590 
I'll back up a little bit just so you
can<00:03:00.860> see<00:03:00.980> what<00:03:01.160> I'm<00:03:01.250> talking<00:03:01.520> about<00:03:01.580> but<00:03:02.000> the

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:02.600 
can see what I'm talking about but the

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:04.810 
can see what I'm talking about but the
wires<00:03:02.810> come<00:03:03.140> through<00:03:03.320> here<00:03:03.620> this<00:03:04.489> is<00:03:04.640> what's

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:04.820 
wires come through here this is what's

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:07.479 
wires come through here this is what's
known<00:03:04.970> as<00:03:05.180> a<00:03:05.209> liquid<00:03:05.780> tight<00:03:06.170> fitting<00:03:06.590> try<00:03:07.430> to

00:03:07.479 --> 00:03:07.489 
known as a liquid tight fitting try to

00:03:07.489 --> 00:03:08.979 
known as a liquid tight fitting try to
focus<00:03:07.730> in<00:03:08.000> on<00:03:08.090> that<00:03:08.150> a<00:03:08.330> little<00:03:08.450> bit<00:03:08.570> for<00:03:08.840> you

00:03:08.979 --> 00:03:08.989 
focus in on that a little bit for you

00:03:08.989 --> 00:03:11.199 
focus in on that a little bit for you
but<00:03:09.800> that<00:03:09.950> liquid<00:03:10.280> tight<00:03:10.459> fitting<00:03:10.820> goes<00:03:10.970> down

00:03:11.199 --> 00:03:11.209 
but that liquid tight fitting goes down

00:03:11.209 --> 00:03:14.080 
but that liquid tight fitting goes down
into<00:03:11.390> the<00:03:11.510> hole<00:03:11.720> the<00:03:11.750> kayak<00:03:12.290> and<00:03:12.910> I'll<00:03:13.910> show

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:14.090 
into the hole the kayak and I'll show

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:18.790 
into the hole the kayak and I'll show

it's got a gasket around the top of it
and<00:03:39.860> I<00:03:40.489> use<00:03:40.790> just<00:03:41.239> eight<00:03:41.690> double-a<00:03:42.530> batteries

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:43.010 
and I use just eight double-a batteries

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:47.370 
and I use just eight double-a batteries
on<00:03:43.310> a<00:03:44.209> nine<00:03:44.840> volt<00:03:45.140> battery<00:03:45.860> connection<00:03:46.310> and

on a nine volt battery connection and

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:51.039 
on a nine volt battery connection and
put<00:03:48.380> an<00:03:48.470> inline<00:03:48.830> fuse<00:03:49.480> for<00:03:50.480> the<00:03:50.630> fish<00:03:50.780> finder

00:03:51.039 --> 00:03:51.049 
put an inline fuse for the fish finder

00:03:51.049 --> 00:03:53.350 
put an inline fuse for the fish finder
and<00:03:51.950> that's<00:03:52.519> what<00:03:52.670> powers<00:03:52.910> the<00:03:53.000> fish<00:03:53.120> finder

00:03:53.350 --> 00:03:53.360 
and that's what powers the fish finder

00:04:03.729 --> 00:04:03.739 
the rechargeable batteries which just

00:04:03.739 --> 00:04:05.500 
the rechargeable batteries which just
make<00:04:03.920> a<00:04:03.950> little<00:04:04.040> bit<00:04:04.190> easier<00:04:04.220> I'm<00:04:05.180> going<00:04:05.360> to<00:04:05.420> go

that was going to fall off some but
surprisingly<00:04:18.140> the<00:04:18.700> battery<00:04:19.700> box<00:04:19.850> is<00:04:20.150> stayed

00:04:20.319 --> 00:04:20.329 
surprisingly the battery box is stayed

00:04:20.329 --> 00:04:22.600 
surprisingly the battery box is stayed
put<00:04:20.600> and<00:04:20.750> it<00:04:20.870> the<00:04:21.019> velcro<00:04:21.200> seems<00:04:21.590> to<00:04:21.769> hold<00:04:21.950> and

and I actually end up removing these by
my<00:06:02.439> feet<00:06:02.680> just<00:06:02.979> so<00:06:03.069> that<00:06:03.219> water<00:06:03.430> could<00:06:03.669> drain

00:06:03.959 --> 00:06:03.969 
my feet just so that water could drain

00:06:03.969 --> 00:06:06.980
