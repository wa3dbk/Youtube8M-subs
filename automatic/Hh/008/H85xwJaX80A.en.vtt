preset<00:00:24.600> kind<00:00:24.840> of<00:00:24.960> preset<00:00:25.859> material<00:00:26.490> what<00:00:26.609> you

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:26.760 
preset kind of preset material what you

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:29.000 
preset kind of preset material what you
just<00:00:26.910> added<00:00:27.180> on<00:00:27.449> but<00:00:28.140> just<00:00:28.170> say<00:00:28.439> for<00:00:28.590> example<00:00:28.650> I

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:29.010 
just added on but just say for example I

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:31.189 
just added on but just say for example I
delete<00:00:29.279> this<00:00:29.490> and<00:00:30.090> this<00:00:30.359> just<00:00:30.660> make<00:00:30.810> it<00:00:30.840> tidy

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:33.360 
this is kind of the basic seen that we

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:35.240 
this is kind of the basic seen that we
have<00:00:33.570> now<00:00:34.140> traditional<00:00:34.680> way<00:00:34.800> that<00:00:34.980> you<00:00:35.040> kind

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:35.250

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.140 
of add materials to objects is you'll

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:39.049 
of add materials to objects is you'll
either<00:00:37.230> go<00:00:37.440> file<00:00:37.770> new<00:00:38.100> material<00:00:38.910> or<00:00:39.030> just

00:00:39.049 --> 00:00:39.059 
either go file new material or just

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:41.090 
either go file new material or just
double<00:00:39.540> click<00:00:39.750> and<00:00:40.020> you'll<00:00:40.410> customize<00:00:40.590> it

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:41.100

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:42.239 
from there but I just add on a

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:44.779 
from there but I just add on a
reflection<00:00:42.899> on<00:00:43.050> for<00:00:43.379> now<00:00:43.590> and<00:00:44.219> you<00:00:44.520> just<00:00:44.610> kind

00:00:44.779 --> 00:00:44.789 
reflection on for now and you just kind

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:46.610 
reflection on for now and you just kind
of<00:00:44.850> customize<00:00:45.600> it<00:00:45.809> personally<00:00:46.260> and<00:00:46.289> do<00:00:46.500> it

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620 
of customize it personally and do it

of customize it personally and do it
that<00:00:46.739> way<00:00:47.000> another<00:00:48.000> way<00:00:48.090> that<00:00:48.239> people<00:00:48.390> use<00:00:48.719> it

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
that way another way that people use it

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:50.510 
that way another way that people use it
they<00:00:48.930> go<00:00:49.050> file<00:00:49.350> and<00:00:49.590> they<00:00:49.649> go<00:00:49.770> shader<00:00:50.190> and

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:50.520 
they go file and they go shader and

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:53.029 
they go file and they go shader and
these<00:00:51.030> one<00:00:51.270> of<00:00:51.360> these<00:00:51.539> common<00:00:52.350> one<00:00:52.469> is<00:00:52.590> new<00:00:52.800> key

00:00:53.029 --> 00:00:53.039 
these one of these common one is new key

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:55.040 
these one of these common one is new key
which<00:00:53.699> is<00:00:53.789> just<00:00:53.850> kind<00:00:54.030> of<00:00:54.059> like<00:00:54.210> a<00:00:54.239> glossy<00:00:54.780> blue

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
I have to just take a quick look at it

00:00:57.780 --> 00:00:59.270 
I have to just take a quick look at it
now<00:00:57.930> just<00:00:58.469> kind<00:00:58.620> of<00:00:58.649> creates<00:00:58.920> quick

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
now just kind of creates quick

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:01.670 
now just kind of creates quick
reflective<00:00:59.820> text<00:01:00.270> that's<00:01:00.989> not<00:01:01.199> the<00:01:01.320> best<00:01:01.559> but

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 
reflective text that's not the best but

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:03.139 
reflective text that's not the best but
by<00:01:01.859> all<00:01:01.980> means<00:01:02.010> it<00:01:02.190> does<00:01:02.340> the<00:01:02.489> job<00:01:02.730> I<00:01:02.789> know<00:01:03.000> I've

00:01:03.139 --> 00:01:03.149 
by all means it does the job I know I've

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:05.899 
by all means it does the job I know I've
used<00:01:03.180> it<00:01:03.480> a<00:01:03.539> few<00:01:03.570> times<00:01:04.309> they<00:01:05.309> would<00:01:05.430> go<00:01:05.580> start

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909 
used it a few times they would go start

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:08.090 
used it a few times they would go start
it<00:01:06.119> now<00:01:06.360> but<00:01:06.570> unfortunately<00:01:07.049> my<00:01:07.140> processor<00:01:07.860> is

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
it now but unfortunately my processor is

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:10.340 
it now but unfortunately my processor is
not<00:01:08.760> the<00:01:08.939> best<00:01:09.119> so<00:01:09.510> it<00:01:09.659> does<00:01:09.810> take<00:01:09.840> quite<00:01:10.229> a

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
not the best so it does take quite a

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:14.000 
not the best so it does take quite a
long<00:01:10.439> time<00:01:11.299> now<00:01:12.299> you<00:01:12.390> get<00:01:12.510> the<00:01:12.600> gist<00:01:12.840> of<00:01:12.990> it<00:01:13.110> but

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
long time now you get the gist of it but

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:15.679 
long time now you get the gist of it but
i'll<00:01:14.280> get<00:01:14.520> the<00:01:14.610> thousands<00:01:15.000> of<00:01:15.090> materials<00:01:15.570> way

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689 
i'll get the thousands of materials way

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:18.530 
i'll get the thousands of materials way
