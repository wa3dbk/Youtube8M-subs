it's<00:04:01.140> all<00:04:01.350> my<00:04:01.560> going<00:04:01.740> to<00:04:01.800> wash<00:04:01.920> it<00:04:02.070> again

that's<00:04:02.820> right<00:04:03.000> he's<00:04:03.270> coming<00:04:03.600> into<00:04:03.750> the

00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:03.840 
that's right he's coming into the

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:05.570 
that's right he's coming into the
break-in<00:04:04.320> area<00:04:04.650> and<00:04:04.740> I<00:04:04.800> just<00:04:05.130> think<00:04:05.400> either

00:04:05.570 --> 00:04:05.580 
break-in area and I just think either

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:08.060 
break-in area and I just think either
his<00:04:05.820> brakes<00:04:06.180> failed<00:04:06.750> he's<00:04:07.500> locked<00:04:07.800> the<00:04:07.950> front

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:08.070 
his brakes failed he's locked the front

00:04:08.070 --> 00:04:10.220 
his brakes failed he's locked the front
sup<00:04:08.490> and<00:04:08.910> the<00:04:09.000> backs<00:04:09.270> are<00:04:09.480> still<00:04:09.690> going<00:04:09.930> I

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:10.230 
sup and the backs are still going I

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:11.840 
sup and the backs are still going I
think<00:04:10.770> actually<00:04:10.920> he<00:04:11.220> might<00:04:11.370> have<00:04:11.520> had<00:04:11.610> a<00:04:11.640> bit

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:11.850 
think actually he might have had a bit

00:04:11.850 --> 00:04:14.270 
think actually he might have had a bit
of<00:04:11.970> brake<00:04:12.150> fade<00:04:12.870> there<00:04:13.260> just<00:04:13.650> didn't<00:04:13.920> retard

00:04:14.270 --> 00:04:14.280 
of brake fade there just didn't retard

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:16.000 
of brake fade there just didn't retard
or<00:04:14.490> he<00:04:14.550> left<00:04:14.760> his<00:04:14.910> breaking<00:04:15.330> just<00:04:15.540> too<00:04:15.720> late

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:16.010 
or he left his breaking just too late

00:04:16.010 --> 00:04:19.190 
or he left his breaking just too late
but<00:04:17.010> that<00:04:17.880> is<00:04:18.000> a<00:04:18.030> great<00:04:18.299> shame<00:04:18.630> because<00:04:18.900> he<00:04:19.109> was

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:19.200 
but that is a great shame because he was

00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:22.099
