00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:06.729 
with the event to come watch is that you

00:02:06.729 --> 00:02:09.060 
with the event to come watch is that you
have<00:02:06.820> the<00:02:06.939> best<00:02:07.119> of<00:02:07.329> an<00:02:07.479> emperor<00:02:07.720> into<00:02:08.229> it<00:02:08.350> how

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:11.530 
it is possible actually Christophe Clah

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:13.860 
it is possible actually Christophe Clah
have<00:02:11.709> made<00:02:12.250> a<00:02:12.400> microstructure<00:02:13.150> of<00:02:13.450> this<00:02:13.660> best

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:13.870 
have made a microstructure of this best

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:16.410 
have made a microstructure of this best
but<00:02:14.200> what<00:02:14.680> is<00:02:14.860> even<00:02:15.160> more<00:02:15.549> important<00:02:16.120> in<00:02:16.360> that

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:16.420 
but what is even more important in that

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:19.050 
but what is even more important in that
it<00:02:16.900> put<00:02:17.140> it<00:02:17.260> into<00:02:17.560> a<00:02:17.590> miracle<00:02:18.220> system<00:02:18.459> which

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:19.060 
it put it into a miracle system which

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:22.050 
it put it into a miracle system which
allows<00:02:19.420> to<00:02:20.049> see<00:02:20.530> the<00:02:20.680> best<00:02:20.860> actually<00:02:21.190> our<00:02:21.370> of

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:22.060 
allows to see the best actually our of

the<00:02:22.239> watch<00:02:22.390> it<00:02:22.600> creates<00:02:22.930> a<00:02:23.110> system<00:02:23.350> of

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:23.680 
the watch it creates a system of

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:27.420 
the watch it creates a system of
reflection<00:02:24.280> that<00:02:24.730> allows<00:02:25.630> the<00:02:26.190> reverse<00:02:27.190> to

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:27.430 
reflection that allows the reverse to

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:29.699 
reflection that allows the reverse to
appear<00:02:27.640> like<00:02:27.880> in<00:02:28.120> three<00:02:28.570> dimension<00:02:29.110> like<00:02:29.530> an

00:02:29.699 --> 00:02:29.709 
appear like in three dimension like an

00:02:29.709 --> 00:02:31.350 
appear like in three dimension like an
ala<00:02:29.950> Graham<00:02:30.190> it<00:02:30.340> is<00:02:30.489> absolutely<00:02:31.030> spectacular

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:31.360
