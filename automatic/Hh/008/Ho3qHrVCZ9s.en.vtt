00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.410
 good morning, be evenings welcome to the 

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:06.319
 channel I am jose and today we are going to explain 

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:09.510
 a strategy for children in 

00:00:06.319 --> 00:00:12.210
 competitive so let's go with them 

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:14.910
 and I say has a very good 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:17.580
 statistical but can not get a 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:21.660
 hollow in the usa since it has one by four 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:24.930
 very painful in the fairy type it's worth 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:26.760
 due to being sinister dragon type the 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:31.370
 fairy guy is going to do one for four 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:35.730
 very very very coarse is worth why 

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:39.300
 and because I mean it does not arrive 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:40.440
 ah yes he has such good statistics is 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:43.890
 true and it's very good statistics 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:48.120
 now we will see them but it does not reach because 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:51.480
 you are watching too many pokemon of 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:54.390
 Fairy type in the competitive in this 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:58.170
 moment, so that's why that's why 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:01:02.620
 reason this game is not going to get to 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:06.190
 s that you deserve so much 

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:10.380
 let's see what we could put 

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:13.990
 to this shred to play in the usa 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:17.890
 which are equally valid strategies 

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:20.320
 ok let's go there the first thing we're going 

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:22.210
 to take with here and ibÃ³n will be me 

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:24.399
 I mean object is going to be the layer 

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:26.229
 chosen that we have two strategies per 

00:01:24.399 --> 00:01:28.960
 here one will wear chosen layer and the 

00:01:26.229 --> 00:01:31.119
 another now we will see it in this set with 

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:32.729
 glasses chosen and with the skill of the 

00:01:31.119 --> 00:01:36.420
 room that is the only one that can 

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:36.420
 have vale 

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:42.009
 that will take us away 

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:43.770
 the attacks of type earth that is to say we 

00:01:42.009 --> 00:01:46.720
 will give immunity to those attacks 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:50.229
 ok with the chosen layer we're going to 

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:51.700
 multiply 15 the special attack but 

00:01:50.229 --> 00:01:54.159
 we are only going to be able to use a 

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:56.170
 movement is worth the four that 

00:01:54.159 --> 00:01:58.360
 let's have what we have in front 

00:01:56.170 --> 00:02:00.759
 let's use a movement type other 

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:02.680
 worth the drake comet is going to be the 

00:02:00.759 --> 00:02:04.869
 movement to be and when not 

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:07.479
 have nothing to do for example I'm going 

00:02:04.869 --> 00:02:10.390
 to put an example against a broken in 

00:02:07.479 --> 00:02:11.860
 washing machine ok let's throw poor taraco 

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:14.530
 that is going to be what most harm is going to 

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:17.200
 do what's wrong with the comet 

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:18.640
 rag to have so much power and a 

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:20.760
 precision of 90 that is pretty 

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:23.610
 interesting 

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:27.120
 we will lower the special attack by 2 

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:28.890
 every time we use it, this is worth 

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:32.640
 It's bad that we have glasses 

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:34.290
 chosen we're going to hit less on the 

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:36.180
 next comet that we will not be able to 

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:38.909
 change of attack and we will stay behind 

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:41.870
 caldosa and provoking us 

00:02:38.909 --> 00:02:44.519
 themselves the change of this kingdom is worth 

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:47.220
 we can also pull pulses a brightness 

00:02:44.519 --> 00:02:49.560
 that I would hit for being also the same as 

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:51.750
 naco kite this pulse a shine 

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:53.849
 You have a 20% chance of doing 

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:56.040
 back to the goal and hit with a 

00:02:53.849 --> 00:02:59.200
 power of 120 thanks to the state that 

00:02:56.040 --> 00:03:01.180
 it provides them revolve vale 

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:03.280
 this bleak pool is going to hurt him 

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:06.010
 the ghost and psychic type pokemon 

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:07.490
 Drake kite will hurt the pokemon of 

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:10.220
 dragon type 

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:12.650
 flamethrower after everyone 

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:16.040
 knows will hurt those pokemon of 

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:20.120
 types of steel plants bug is worth the 

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:21.980
 ice also and accurate wave is worth 

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:24.380
 for coverage of types that we know that 

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:26.240
 fight many guys and then we're going to 

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:28.790
 take it to try to cover the maximum 

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:31.570
 possible the bad of accurate waves that 

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:36.380
 it has 70 percent accuracy and 

00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:39.560
 You can make us a serious fault it good 

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:43.880
 how are we going to carry the sets 

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:47.020
 and all this chess roll for this 

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:51.310
 strategy I would honestly put you 

00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:53.900
 252 eps on ps to try to survive 

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:55.260
 to be able to throw the maximum attacks 

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:58.769
 possible 

00:03:55.260 --> 00:04:01.079
 and 252 in special attack with a 

00:03:58.769 --> 00:04:03.950
 modest nature we will try to paste the 

00:04:01.079 --> 00:04:05.780
 possible it 

00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:08.810
 and well this is the first strategy 

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:10.480
 for this dragon that does not have much value 

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:12.670
 plus 

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:16.400
 and now the second strategy that is the 

00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:18.680
 that I use and the one I like the most is 

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:20.449
 with the chosen handkerchief we are going to 

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:22.280
 surpass almost all the pokemon in 

00:04:20.449 --> 00:04:26.800
 speed and forgiveness because I have not 

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:31.240
 put nature will be modest worth 

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:36.630
 ok let's take this one turn with with 

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:39.540
 252 eps plus modest nature 

00:04:36.630 --> 00:04:43.230
 that is going to have 383 special attack 

00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:46.710
 which in itself is pretty good and with 

00:04:43.230 --> 00:04:49.740
 the speed of 252 eps is worth we go to 

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:51.150
 get to 295 with the chosen handkerchief 

00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:54.240
 let's get this done 

00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:56.970
 multiply by 1.5 and thus beating 

00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:59.780
 our worst enemies as per 

00:04:56.970 --> 00:04:59.780
 example s 

00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:06.330
 I crouch normal watson mega metering and 

00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:09.780
 things like that are worth those who 

00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:14.130
 we could easily kill an attack 

00:05:09.780 --> 00:05:15.990
 it's okay so nothing guys up here is this 

00:05:14.130 --> 00:05:19.080
 strategy I hope you liked it 

00:05:15.990 --> 00:05:22.850
