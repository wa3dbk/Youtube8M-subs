00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:18.220 
to set up three or four visits I think

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:19.710 
to set up three or four visits I think
another<00:02:18.550> aspect<00:02:19.060> of<00:02:19.270> it<00:02:19.390> that's<00:02:19.540> real

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:19.720 
another aspect of it that's real

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:22.320 
another aspect of it that's real
important<00:02:20.200> is<00:02:20.380> that<00:02:20.410> the<00:02:20.950> people<00:02:21.220> that<00:02:22.060> have

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:22.330 
important is that the people that have

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:24.690 
important is that the people that have
this<00:02:22.510> technology<00:02:22.810> that<00:02:23.680> they<00:02:23.890> sense<00:02:24.580> that

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:24.700 
this technology that they sense that

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:26.640 
this technology that they sense that
your<00:02:25.060> own<00:02:25.330> cutting<00:02:25.720> edge<00:02:25.900> that<00:02:26.230> you're<00:02:26.440> up

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:26.650 
your own cutting edge that you're up

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:29.460 
your own cutting edge that you're up
with<00:02:27.580> what's<00:02:27.880> going<00:02:28.060> on<00:02:28.300> in<00:02:28.570> dentistry<00:02:29.050> I

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:29.470 
with what's going on in dentistry I

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:33.000 
with what's going on in dentistry I
could<00:02:30.400> spend<00:02:30.940> a<00:02:31.209> lot<00:02:31.870> of<00:02:31.900> money<00:02:32.170> in<00:02:32.410> time<00:02:32.709> and

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:33.010 
could spend a lot of money in time and

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:35.040 
could spend a lot of money in time and
journals<00:02:33.820> and<00:02:34.030> stuff<00:02:34.209> advertising<00:02:34.900> or

journals and stuff advertising or

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:37.290 
journals and stuff advertising or
newspapers<00:02:35.770> and<00:02:36.010> it's<00:02:36.400> not<00:02:36.550> as<00:02:36.670> effective<00:02:37.150> as

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:37.300 
newspapers and it's not as effective as

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:39.780 
newspapers and it's not as effective as
having<00:02:37.570> a<00:02:37.630> patient<00:02:37.810> glancing<00:02:38.520> believe<00:02:39.520> what<00:02:39.700> I

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:39.790 
having a patient glancing believe what I

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:43.680 
having a patient glancing believe what I
had<00:02:39.970> done<00:02:40.150> today<00:02:40.360> in<00:02:40.570> one<00:02:40.750> visit<00:02:42.330> years<00:02:43.330> ago

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:43.690 
had done today in one visit years ago

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:46.500 
had done today in one visit years ago
when<00:02:44.410> I<00:02:44.500> got<00:02:44.680> out<00:02:44.800> of<00:02:44.830> school<00:02:45.209> there<00:02:46.209> was<00:02:46.330> one

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:46.510 
when I got out of school there was one

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:48.570 
when I got out of school there was one
way<00:02:46.690> the<00:02:46.810> things<00:02:47.050> had<00:02:47.260> to<00:02:47.350> be<00:02:47.380> done<00:02:47.680> and<00:02:48.040> I

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:48.580 
way the things had to be done and I

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:51.420 
way the things had to be done and I
believe<00:02:48.910> that<00:02:48.940> that's<00:02:49.720> the<00:02:49.930> way<00:02:50.050> it<00:02:50.140> is<00:02:50.230> and<00:02:50.620> if

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:51.430 
believe that that's the way it is and if

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:53.040 
believe that that's the way it is and if
you<00:02:51.580> did<00:02:51.820> the<00:02:52.030> same<00:02:52.270> procedure<00:02:52.690> that<00:02:52.870> was<00:02:52.989> done

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:53.050 
you did the same procedure that was done

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:55.860 
you did the same procedure that was done
differently<00:02:53.680> you<00:02:54.280> were<00:02:54.400> wrong<00:02:54.610> now<00:02:55.330> you<00:02:55.690> say

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:55.870 
differently you were wrong now you say

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:57.690 
differently you were wrong now you say
that's<00:02:56.020> kind<00:02:56.290> of<00:02:56.350> hard<00:02:56.680> to<00:02:56.800> have<00:02:57.280> that<00:02:57.459> kind<00:02:57.670> of

00:02:57.690 --> 00:02:57.700 
that's kind of hard to have that kind of

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:00.120 
that's kind of hard to have that kind of
opinion<00:02:58.269> but<00:02:58.450> dentists<00:02:59.260> are<00:02:59.410> those<00:02:59.560> type<00:03:00.100> of

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:00.130 
opinion but dentists are those type of

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:01.620 
opinion but dentists are those type of
people<00:03:00.549> we<00:03:00.580> have<00:03:00.790> these<00:03:00.970> black<00:03:01.299> and<00:03:01.510> white

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:01.630 
people we have these black and white

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:03.270 
people we have these black and white
areas<00:03:02.019> that's<00:03:02.140> either<00:03:02.320> right<00:03:02.620> or<00:03:02.650> wrong<00:03:02.980> I

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:03.280 
areas that's either right or wrong I

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:05.070 
areas that's either right or wrong I
found<00:03:04.000> that<00:03:04.120> that's<00:03:04.330> not<00:03:04.510> necessarily<00:03:04.930> true

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:05.080 
found that that's not necessarily true

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:06.930 
found that that's not necessarily true
there<00:03:05.440> are<00:03:05.470> a<00:03:05.530> lot<00:03:05.680> of<00:03:05.709> ways<00:03:05.950> to<00:03:05.980> do<00:03:06.340> the<00:03:06.730> same
