00:00:04.070 --> 00:00:07.700
 hello welcome to this new mode 

00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:09.980
 cooperative this time dedicated to the 

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:12.709
 technology have invited william 

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:14.780
 who is our technology expert and 

00:00:12.709 --> 00:00:16.550
 you know him and above all so that we 

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:18.770
 talk about this phenomenon that is wrong that 

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:20.929
 we are witnessing new and 

00:00:18.770 --> 00:00:22.220
 small game consoles that night 

00:00:20.929 --> 00:00:25.820
 are above all not talk about 

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:28.880
 PlayStation 4 or Xbox 720 talk about 

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:30.830
 goya projectile tell us a bit this 

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:33.350
 because we are seeing a lot especially 

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:35.750
 android but a bit of everything 

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:37.430
 consoles that look like they're going to 

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:38.600
 my opinion revolutionize or so 

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:40.160
 They will revolutionize least a little 

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:43.399
 market because it is something completely 

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:46.460
 new and above all I think they have to 

00:00:43.399 --> 00:00:49.160
 his favor is for developers 

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:51.410
 something much more appealing because if you create 

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:53.270
 Android mobile game is better for you 

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:54.380
 for tablets and for this new mode of 

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:57.020
 game 

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:59.030
 while creating a separate game that you 

00:00:57.020 --> 00:01:02.180
 It takes much more time and money to 

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:03.710
 example is exclusive for Nintendo 3DS 

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:05.810
 this platform will make a port 

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:08.990
 It takes a long time a lot of money 

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:10.610
 then it looks very good good 

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:12.470
 now we see them a little little by little 

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:14.030
 is active active against let's try 

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:16.550
 list the because it is true that these 

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:19.100
 last months and especially for starting 

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:20.870
 This cessation of strikes week 

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:21.470
 last because many have joined the 

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:23.750
 list 

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:26.510
 If the first start I think because 

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:29.150
 is what changed all that and still 

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:31.550
 we have not been able to try and win here 

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:33.710
 we have it but it was the one that changed everything 

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:36.680
 because he also kickstarted some 

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:38.509
 project that already has the support of the 

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:40.940
 users who put their money so that 

00:01:38.509 --> 00:01:43.280
 This is created and good because it is a 

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:44.869
 android very tiny console that we 

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:47.119
 He deceived us commented that it seems 

00:01:44.869 --> 00:01:48.800
 largest in the spirit and tiny and is 

00:01:47.119 --> 00:01:50.240
 They are basically a console in which 

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:52.100
 You can play any title 

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:53.290
 Android also recently talked about that 

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:55.330
 already 

00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:56.680
 a selection of developers who have 

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:58.630
 already received the development kit a 

00:01:56.680 --> 00:02:00.760
 I bit already received the console and 

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:02.100
 can work with her for sure 

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:05.470
 play because I think they are also 

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:07.720
 and then passing it phenomenal and within 

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:11.110
 we will have nothing and will be released 

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:12.880
 with a catalog catalog and then 

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:16.620
 also another android game console 

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:19.900
 stick that is even smaller and is a 

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:22.240
 It is different as it seems a memory usb 

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:25.570
 in fact it connects directly with 

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:28.390
 hdmi and offers the same an experience 

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:30.100
 of Android game with a very nice controller 

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:31.600
 I like it much chiquitÃ­n 

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:34.360
 it has pockets and yes practically 

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:36.190
 but what you are taking is a 

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:37.360
 desktop really because you connect it to 

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:40.570
 squaring shouting the visa after a 

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:44.560
 Sunday yes and then I can continue with 

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:46.480
 android without envy envy and 

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:48.220
 It offers more things because you too 

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:52.630
 It allows you to play streaming that allows 

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:54.460
 Both Android titles and PC titles 

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:55.660
 but with good conditions have 

00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:58.810
 than having the computer on a card 

00:02:55.660 --> 00:03:00.970
 nvidia I think but good lets you is 

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:03.820
 have the computer there and be playing 

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:05.710
 quietly with your projectile is the 

00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:07.510
 unique that includes a screen with tati 

00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:09.100
 what we wanted to even consider 

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:10.840
 although you can connect to all 

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:12.400
 treatment to consider a console by 

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:13.870
 have effectively handheld console 

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:16.510
 this is a console that you can take 

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:18.670
 on the subway as people carried their 

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:21.220
 pc is edited for example also it has been 

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:23.530
 a little surprise and ces of 

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:26.020
 vegas yes yes has been what nobody 

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:27.130
 He expected and what has impacted me more 

00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:28.750
 I think also there 's more to 

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:31.240
 Generally people are eager to 

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:32.530
 see this for now is his own 

00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:34.750
 name suggests is a project a project 

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:37.360
 is farther away than humans who do 

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:40.570
 that could be collated and you can 

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:42.490
 juanma was playing with her and has 

00:03:40.570 --> 00:03:45.910
 very good looking also and then another that 

00:03:42.490 --> 00:03:48.580
 we have here is good ram of 

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:50.740
 bucket thick the famous steam box 

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:53.440
 Japanese Teambox will be based on Linux 

00:03:50.740 --> 00:03:56.380
 and will allow access to steam which already 

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:59.390
 is a guarantee of a catalog or something not 

00:03:56.380 --> 00:04:01.820
 and I like a lot too reid eretz 

00:03:59.390 --> 00:04:04.070
 which it is already moving away a little more of this 

00:04:01.820 --> 00:04:07.250
 cheap laptop because it goes from 

00:04:04.070 --> 00:04:09.380
 the 1,000 dollars eye and that like tablet 

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:11.120
 it also will send a 

00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:12.980
 peripheral with which you can play 

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:15.290
 any title but it's another option and 

00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:18.410
 I especially like it because it shows 

00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:20.180
 This new trend has allowed 

00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:22.100
 many game types but also 

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:24.620
 will sell a cargo base in which 

00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:26.810
 connect USB probably controls 

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:28.610
 better experience with command 

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:30.860
 razer but good and you can use it as 

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:34.030
 a console desktop or you can 

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:35.990
 connect to a keyboard for a nn or 

00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:38.080
 simply use it as a tablet 

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:40.130
 Windows 8 that is a worldwide 

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:42.620
 taken one step takes us one step further 

00:04:40.130 --> 00:04:44.590
 and quite clear, you believe above all that 

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:47.120
 you are leaving to do a little 

00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:48.650
 for some of these consoles as 

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:50.450
 economic because we have not spoken 

00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:53.180
 price but it looks like it's going to come out 

00:04:50.450 --> 00:04:55.580
 about $ 99 game stick speak of 77 

00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:59.360
 dollars this kind of consoles do you think that 

00:04:55.580 --> 00:05:00.800
 It will be a very big competition for 

00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:02.510
 example the laptops of large 

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:04.640
 nintendo sony companies 

00:05:02.510 --> 00:05:06.800
 I think that at the very least it is a call from 

00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:08.690
 attention because and here if we have to 

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:11.830
 speak directly about nintendo have been 

00:05:08.690 --> 00:05:14.510
 always denied to carry his games for 

00:05:11.830 --> 00:05:16.610
 God and they want only for android 

00:05:14.510 --> 00:05:18.260
 Nintendo experience and it is a 

00:05:16.610 --> 00:05:20.240
 call for attention because it already allows you 

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:22.730
 to the users to have the option of their 

00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:25.190
 portable and developers to 

00:05:22.730 --> 00:05:27.740
 end games can create very similar 

00:05:25.190 --> 00:05:30.020
 or a very similar experience then 

00:05:27.740 --> 00:05:32.180
 you have to put the batteries for 

00:05:30.020 --> 00:05:34.250
 least develop in my opinion 

00:05:32.180 --> 00:05:35.810
 develop for other platforms good 

00:05:34.250 --> 00:05:37.250
 I what I really want is that 

00:05:35.810 --> 00:05:38.810
 These people start we begin to 

00:05:37.250 --> 00:05:40.480
 arrive and I know we can do analysis 

00:05:38.810 --> 00:05:42.530
 here 

00:05:40.480 --> 00:05:43.910
 we can recommend because there are many 

00:05:42.530 --> 00:05:45.530
 people who say that this is reality is 

00:05:43.910 --> 00:05:47.320
 an android mobile 

00:05:45.530 --> 00:05:49.490
 that you can connect to TV and that 

00:05:47.320 --> 00:05:51.200
 now more or less can also be done 

00:05:49.490 --> 00:05:53.450
 there are ways to connect a model to the 

00:05:51.200 --> 00:05:55.640
 TV there are ways to buy some 

00:05:53.450 --> 00:05:57.530
 stick you should not go for android but 

00:05:55.640 --> 00:05:59.150
 Well this is the complete experience 

00:05:57.530 --> 00:06:01.370
 a pad and very cheap yes yes yes 

00:05:59.150 --> 00:06:03.230
 I actually think it 's going to 

00:06:01.370 --> 00:06:04.970
 Like nothing will change transform 

00:06:03.230 --> 00:06:07.190
 complete but will change the industry 

00:06:04.970 --> 00:06:08.600
 or perhaps a new device reach 

00:06:07.190 --> 00:06:13.070
 the industry that good 

00:06:08.600 --> 00:06:16.250
 We'll see, I want, we want to 

00:06:13.070 --> 00:06:18.560
 play and when we have here 

00:06:16.250 --> 00:06:20.420
 and make an invocation questions to 

00:06:18.560 --> 00:06:21.440
 our readers would no longer be many 

00:06:20.420 --> 00:06:23.150
 because we are the next mode 

00:06:21.440 --> 00:06:26.200
 cooperative perfect and you 

00:06:23.150 --> 00:06:26.200
 also until the next
