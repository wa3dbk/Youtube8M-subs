00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:45.940 
rather are mooing badass so I always
recommend<00:02:44.150> getting<00:02:44.840> your<00:02:44.930> posing<00:02:45.440> down<00:02:45.620> first

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:45.950 
recommend getting your posing down first

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:48.370 
recommend getting your posing down first
and<00:02:46.340> then<00:02:46.400> when<00:02:46.670> you<00:02:46.790> learn<00:02:46.940> that<00:02:46.970> you<00:02:47.270> can<00:02:48.200> put

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:48.380 
and then when you learn that you can put

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:49.930 
and then when you learn that you can put
the<00:02:48.620> arm<00:02:48.920> movements<00:02:49.340> in<00:02:49.460> you<00:02:49.610> don't<00:02:49.700> want<00:02:49.790> to

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:49.940 
the arm movements in you don't want to

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:54.230 
the arm movements in you don't want to
go<00:02:50.030> too<00:02:50.090> crazy

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:54.240 

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:58.360 

as<00:02:54.510> well<00:02:54.810> like<00:02:55.170> especially<00:02:55.590> issues<00:02:55.980> we<00:02:56.340> have

00:02:58.360 --> 00:02:58.370 
as well like especially issues we have

00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:00.690 
as well like especially issues we have
so<00:02:59.370> there's<00:02:59.550> a<00:02:59.610> lot<00:02:59.760> of<00:02:59.910> things<00:03:00.060> that<00:03:00.240> you

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:00.700 
so there's a lot of things that you

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:02.160 
so there's a lot of things that you
but<00:03:00.940> the<00:03:01.030> first<00:03:01.330> one<00:03:01.540> that<00:03:01.569> I<00:03:01.720> always<00:03:01.900> work

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:02.170 
but the first one that I always work

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:04.350 
but the first one that I always work
with<00:03:02.200> in<00:03:02.410> working<00:03:03.400> on<00:03:03.490> as<00:03:03.730> your<00:03:03.880> front<00:03:04.090> those

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:04.360 
with in working on as your front those

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:07.170 
with in working on as your front those
your<00:03:04.660> front<00:03:04.930> goes<00:03:05.140> is<00:03:05.319> here<00:03:05.819> so<00:03:06.819> you're<00:03:07.000> going

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:07.180 
your front goes is here so you're going

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:10.229 
your front goes is here so you're going
to<00:03:07.239> drop<00:03:07.480> your<00:03:07.720> arm<00:03:07.900> in<00:03:08.260> here<00:03:09.130> it's<00:03:10.090> almost

00:03:10.229 --> 00:03:10.239 
to drop your arm in here it's almost

00:03:10.239 --> 00:03:14.630 
to drop your arm in here it's almost
like<00:03:11.520> like<00:03:12.520> dance

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:14.640 
like like dance

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:19.660 
like like dance
so<00:03:15.210> you're<00:03:15.360> walking<00:03:15.480> out

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:19.670 

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:21.340 

and<00:03:19.790> drop<00:03:20.270> it<00:03:20.300> and

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:21.350 
and drop it and

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:23.470 
and drop it and
because<00:03:21.680> the<00:03:21.830> reason<00:03:22.130> why<00:03:22.220> I<00:03:22.250> rounded<00:03:22.940> here<00:03:23.210> is

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:23.480 
because the reason why I rounded here is

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:28.870 
because the reason why I rounded here is
because<00:03:25.240> you<00:03:26.240> can<00:03:26.420> see<00:03:26.660> like<00:03:27.160> my<00:03:28.160> waist<00:03:28.430> comes

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:28.880 
because you can see like my waist comes

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:31.330 
because you can see like my waist comes
in<00:03:29.150> on<00:03:29.480> this

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:31.340 
in on this

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:33.670 
in on this
so<00:03:31.849> here<00:03:32.480> you<00:03:32.780> can't<00:03:32.989> see<00:03:33.170> anything<00:03:33.380> when<00:03:33.590> you

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:33.680 
so here you can't see anything when you

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:37.270 
so here you can't see anything when you
square<00:03:33.980> up<00:03:34.010> your<00:03:34.670> boot<00:03:34.940> shows<00:03:35.239> here<00:03:36.110> and<00:03:36.920> then

00:03:37.270 --> 00:03:37.280 
square up your boot shows here and then

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:39.510 
square up your boot shows here and then
my<00:03:37.400> waist<00:03:37.640> comes<00:03:37.940> in

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:39.520
