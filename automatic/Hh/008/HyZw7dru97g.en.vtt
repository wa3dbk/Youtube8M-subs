00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:24.170 
build the XML sitemaps in XML sitemaps

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:26.440 
build the XML sitemaps in XML sitemaps
according<00:01:24.679> to<00:01:24.829> Google<00:01:25.130> files<00:01:25.429> for<00:01:25.850> sitemaps

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:26.450 
according to Google files for sitemaps

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:29.919 
according to Google files for sitemaps
you<00:01:26.990> can<00:01:27.170> build<00:01:27.499> a<00:01:27.799> 50<00:01:28.310> thousand<00:01:28.759> files<00:01:28.999> yes<00:01:29.719> a

00:01:29.919 --> 00:01:29.929 
you can build a 50 thousand files yes a

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:32.770 
you can build a 50 thousand files yes a
50<00:01:30.649> thousand<00:01:31.039> files<00:01:31.280> for<00:01:31.700> each<00:01:31.969> sitemaps<00:01:32.600> and

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:32.780 
50 thousand files for each sitemaps and

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:35.109 
50 thousand files for each sitemaps and
I<00:01:33.289> think<00:01:33.560> almost<00:01:34.009> it<00:01:34.310> covers<00:01:34.729> the<00:01:34.880> whole

00:01:35.109 --> 00:01:35.119 
I think almost it covers the whole

00:01:35.119 --> 00:01:38.980 
I think almost it covers the whole
website<00:01:35.420> all<00:01:35.990> over<00:01:36.530> the<00:01:36.590> world<00:01:36.920> so<00:01:37.840> today<00:01:38.840> we

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:38.990 
website all over the world so today we

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:41.020 
website all over the world so today we
are<00:01:39.049> going<00:01:39.319> to<00:01:39.409> discuss<00:01:39.889> this<00:01:40.069> some<00:01:40.490> points

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:41.030 
are going to discuss this some points

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:43.840 
are going to discuss this some points
most<00:01:41.869> important<00:01:42.499> points<00:01:42.859> we<00:01:42.950> can<00:01:43.130> say<00:01:43.369> that<00:01:43.639> in

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:43.850 
most important points we can say that in

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:46.449 
most important points we can say that in
the<00:01:44.090> XML<00:01:44.539> sitemaps<00:01:45.109> the<00:01:45.649> multiple<00:01:46.159> sitemaps

00:01:46.449 --> 00:01:46.459 
the XML sitemaps the multiple sitemaps

00:01:46.459 --> 00:01:50.199 
the XML sitemaps the multiple sitemaps
yes<00:01:47.329> in<00:01:47.869> the<00:01:48.079> multiple<00:01:48.560> sitemaps<00:01:48.889> I<00:01:49.429> will<00:01:50.060> say

00:01:50.199 --> 00:01:50.209 
yes in the multiple sitemaps I will say

00:01:50.209 --> 00:01:52.569 
yes in the multiple sitemaps I will say
that<00:01:50.420> for<00:01:50.630> example<00:01:50.990> if<00:01:51.649> you<00:01:51.920> have<00:01:52.159> 1<00:01:52.369> lakh

00:01:52.569 --> 00:01:52.579 
that for example if you have 1 lakh

00:01:52.579 --> 00:01:53.590 
that for example if you have 1 lakh
pages<00:01:53.060> for<00:01:53.329> you

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:53.600 
pages for you

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:56.440 
pages for you
websites<00:01:54.049> and<00:01:54.290> if<00:01:55.070> you<00:01:55.280> built<00:01:55.549> assignments

00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:56.450 
websites and if you built assignments

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:58.960 
websites and if you built assignments
for<00:01:56.689> your<00:01:56.990> e-commerce<00:01:57.470> website<00:01:57.740> then<00:01:58.640> you<00:01:58.790> can

00:01:58.960 --> 00:01:58.970 
for your e-commerce website then you can

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:01.960 
for your e-commerce website then you can
add<00:01:59.210> on<00:01:59.479> the<00:01:59.630> end<00:01:59.869> 10<00:02:00.530> files<00:02:00.799> for<00:02:01.250> the<00:02:01.340> 10,000

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:01.970 
add on the end 10 files for the 10,000

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:04.840 
add on the end 10 files for the 10,000
files<00:02:02.180> each<00:02:02.570> and<00:02:02.840> added<00:02:03.619> the<00:02:04.040> webmaster<00:02:04.640> code

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:04.850 
files each and added the webmaster code

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:08.050 
files each and added the webmaster code
so<00:02:05.390> it<00:02:05.600> will<00:02:05.780> be<00:02:05.900> very<00:02:06.110> easy<00:02:06.170> to<00:02:07.040> beat<00:02:07.250> in<00:02:07.549> XML

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:08.060 
so it will be very easy to beat in XML

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:10.479 
so it will be very easy to beat in XML
sitemaps<00:02:08.600> let's<00:02:09.530> start<00:02:09.830> with<00:02:09.979> the<00:02:10.100> second
