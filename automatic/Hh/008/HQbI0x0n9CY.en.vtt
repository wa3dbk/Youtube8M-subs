00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.100
 to create ordinary and unique 

00:00:02.939 --> 00:00:07.799
 interiors we use decorative 

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:09.780
 stucco antique finish 

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:12.780
 one of the most common and 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:15.839
 interesting ways of applying big 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:17.279
 need it all depends on your fantasy it 

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:20.340
 there may be a rough texture 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:22.470
 or smoothly and now our master will show 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:25.080
 one way of applying decorative 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:27.119
 plaster it will be smooth texture 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:29.880
 which everyone can repeat at himself 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:32.309
 at home itself before applying decorative 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:34.950
 plaster does not require perfect 

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:37.890
 alignment of the walls as the texture will hide 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:40.290
 minor defects the first stage of our 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:43.050
 work is priming the surface after 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:45.660
 what put elite plaster on the wall 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:49.320
 the material is soft and ductile 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:51.450
 applied very easy smooth movements 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:53.400
 if in the process of applying you allowed 

00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:55.079
 mistake or you do n't like something in 

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:57.390
 for 20-30 minutes 

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:59.670
 you can fix this stuff this 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:02.700
 let our master do 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:05.430
 riveting slightly 

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:08.040
 touching the trowel surface if you 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:11.220
 want a coarser texture layer should 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:14.070
 be thicker this material is very durable 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:16.650
 he contains himself a pulp formation 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:18.119
 after complete drying by can not 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:20.160
 work even dragon 

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:23.330
 after applying we leave our 

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:26.310
 billing dry from 6 o'clock and before the trial 

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:28.890
 depending on the number effect of antiquity 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:29.460
 achieved by applying translucent 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:32.970
 patina 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:36.090
 sponge or brush clear color 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:39.860
 turned out very intense but can 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:39.860
 correct in a wet sponge 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:49.740
 in a couple of hours our patina will dry we 

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:51.990
 get the finished surface 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:54.060
 which is enhanced by applying 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:57.810
 plaster relief well, September is not 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:02:00.240
 I will pull durable labo so strong 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:02.759
 easy to wash 

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:05.479
 rooms like you in the kitchen 

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:05.479
