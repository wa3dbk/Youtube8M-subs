00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:10.230
 the video of oliver samsung you like it 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.330
 I hardly believe it, of course I am still 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:14.370
 always on the ces here just now 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:15.930
 thalias galaxy a3 in hand the summer 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:17.790
 over there 

00:00:15.930 --> 00:00:19.770
 and now we have the a5 here for that 

00:00:17.790 --> 00:00:22.470
 five is only slightly different 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:24.690
 from 3 because here we have the same 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:26.670
 Arrangement also completely metal again 

00:00:24.690 --> 00:00:28.470
 the rear too and it looks too 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:30.560
 really very similar if I even 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:32.239
 very much the same 

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:33.800
 one has the lock here and again 

00:00:32.239 --> 00:00:37.460
 unlock button 

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:39.290
 micro sim slot the micro sd slot the 35 

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:42.800
 millimeter jack plug hidden here 

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:45.710
 A USB 2.0 port connects the first microphone 

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:47.239
 the loud but soft under the rock 

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:50.030
 second microphone on the back too 

00:00:47.239 --> 00:00:52.309
 like the ice 3 and the a3 the arrangement 

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:53.449
 with lightning camera speakers and 

00:00:52.309 --> 00:00:56.059
 otherwise the device is different 

00:00:53.449 --> 00:00:58.280
 actually only in the resolution and in the 

00:00:56.059 --> 00:01:01.129
 display and then still in the frame 

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:04.460
 So we have a five inch hd here 

00:01:01.129 --> 00:01:08.600
 display at the 12,080 x 720 points 

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:11.360
 hd super amoled the 0 5 inches taller than 

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:13.100
 at the a3 the camera behind okay the sauna 

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:15.600
 differently we have here 3 10 megapixels 

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:17.270
 wahn a 31 8 megapixel 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:21.630
 also as always different modes 

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:24.900
 otherwise on lte bluetooth 4.0 nfc too 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:25.799
 interception 400 with 1 2 gigahertz per 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:28.110
 keep it in here 

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:29.820
 the difference here anyway 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:32.690
 the software should have the same answer 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:34.970
 kitkat 4.4 point 4 

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:37.100
 however, we have 2 gb ram here 

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:38.630
 theoretically this could be the device 

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:41.000
 provide even longer with updates 

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:42.250
 as with android lollipop that we always have 

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.800
 still have to see everything 

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:46.540
 otherwise we also have a 2300 

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:50.080
 milliamperes strong battery because 

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:52.180
 instead of the galaxy a30 1900 

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:54.100
 mah it remains to be seen 

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:55.300
 how the battery beats itself like that 

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:57.400
 actually be pretty good and otherwise 

00:01:55.300 --> 00:02:00.010
 it just looks pretty chic 

00:01:57.400 --> 00:02:01.720
 has this old style from the s3 again 

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:04.070
 brought in and has to complete 

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:05.720
 Metal so really brave 

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:08.460
 and has the logical next one 

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:10.710
 Step to the galaxy alpha done 

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:13.160
 Here we have a silver one 

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:13.160
 variant 

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:18.310
 here, of course, is one of them 

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:18.310
 golden 

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:25.220
 or slightly black version 

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:26.600
 yes, what about the a3 I look something 

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:29.980
 we are still nice to see 

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:29.980
 otherwise we settled in the blog
