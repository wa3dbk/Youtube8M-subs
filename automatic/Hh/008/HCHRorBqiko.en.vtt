00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:04.699
 ah 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:23.099
 It is very common for workshops 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:26.009
 joinery wood chips are discarded 

00:00:23.099 --> 00:00:28.259
 that apparently they will not lend any 

00:00:26.009 --> 00:00:31.140
 service rather than becoming 

00:00:28.259 --> 00:00:33.809
 firewood or simple trash in this video 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:36.420
 we will see one of the many ways that 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:39.269
 there is to recycle said leftovers for 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:41.699
 turn them into something useful in this 

00:00:39.269 --> 00:00:44.790
 case we will turn them into a pretty 

00:00:41.699 --> 00:00:46.979
 cover for a dining table what 

00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:49.680
 first is to put the pieces in a 

00:00:46.979 --> 00:00:51.840
 flat surface we use glue 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:54.239
 industrial for high contact wood 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:57.600
 and we are joining them in a uniform way 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:59.609
 to give them a table shape is a job 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:02.100
 that requires patience and concentration 

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:05.070
 to get them firmly united 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:07.710
 and even once the size is achieved 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:08.700
 desired is proceeded to cut back and give the 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:11.759
 desired shape 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:14.640
 then we use a brush to remove 

00:01:11.759 --> 00:01:17.460
 surplus and smooth the surface when 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:19.619
 the surface is ready I closed sanÃ¡ with 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:22.590
 sealer for wood and proceeds to 

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:24.930
 sanding with the surface sanded 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:27.270
 proceeds to make a channel with the router 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:29.580
 around the deck on which 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:32.280
 we will insert a small cut ribbon 

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:34.800
 of the same wood before inserting the 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:38.100
 ribbon color wood is dyed 

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:40.410
 desired once you have inserted the 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:43.440
 wooden strip and is fixed under pressure and 

00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:46.470
 with a stick this ribbon will give a touch 

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:48.930
 from design to cover to finalize 

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:52.500
 we trace the base of the table with their 

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:55.470
 respective legs in this case I did 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:57.720
 a curved design is finally dyed and 

00:01:55.470 --> 00:02:00.619
 It is varnished if you liked this video
