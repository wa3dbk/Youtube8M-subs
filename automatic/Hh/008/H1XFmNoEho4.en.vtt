00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:10.320
 first of warm kg as comments 

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:13.170
 this match generated this 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:15.170
 fact disappointed because between prediction 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:19.109
 to technology or ended up like this 

00:00:15.170 --> 00:00:21.930
 I'm from the match fought by 

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:23.310
 hours we had misery of the 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:25.350
 rigor that knows how as 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:28.890
 premier unallocated penalties charge 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:30.750
 we had these balls with cyans 2 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:33.899
 with boasted I thought either 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:35.850
 because if something different happens but 

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:37.969
 that since time surely with ha 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:42.660
 the balance has changed 

00:00:37.969 --> 00:00:45.390
 we also found he loved grave 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:46.920
 lack always put well in the field and there 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:49.890
 has granted little we also had the 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:54.989
 rocco ball with bound sonatas that 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:57.120
 we could have had a different effect though 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:01:01.260
 I'm definitely there to be 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:02.760
 concern something physically 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:04.890
 the thing that I'm sorry about that unfortunately 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:07.409
 some players so week it is 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:09.650
 trained only two days due to 

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:09.650
 major force 

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:14.159
 advances with obsession to the many that one is 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:16.890
 trained two days I'm a bit sorry 

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:22.950
 because you do the full -fledged treble 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:25.070
 physical queens would still have been one 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:27.119
 of different shirts but in short 

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:28.950
 we found our pecoranera 

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:31.560
 ready to have found drills in the 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:34.140
 state farm was firm to be among the 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:35.850
 pull up our sleeves but I also said 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:39.570
 guys that end up with others up 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:40.950
 what he was sorry sorry 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:43.440
 lose this factory precient of 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:46.560
 home is being a match 

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:48.690
 particular yesterday in Syria images can 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:50.450
 give good satisfactions too 

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:52.470
 this time crops played well by us 

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:54.800
 with our pensions 

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:57.630
 according to you the next progress 

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:59.009
 But sorry the winery in 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:02.190
 sleeves and work on the mistakes that 

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:05.160
 may have been made and viewed 

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:06.479
 on the exhibition de luca so I wouldn't be there 

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:09.149
 worried if these players don't 

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:11.970
 they had given winning percent instead 

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:13.319
 under the 40 of programs to free the 

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:14.640
 our physical conditions why 

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:16.770
 we know about the loads we've done 

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:19.520
 so others have also been time for 

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:19.520
 assimilate 

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:30.390
 a note should carry the defense 

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:32.549
 because now fly two goals to cavani today 

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:36.989
 glue the traps caught one 

00:02:32.549 --> 00:02:38.670
 condition however with the stars also 

00:02:36.989 --> 00:02:39.030
 in the years diego, in short, always taken 

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:40.799
 goals 

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:44.370
 from this point of view what is there to be 

00:02:40.799 --> 00:02:45.599
 record without registering the input 

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:48.810
 of holy cross 

00:02:45.599 --> 00:02:50.909
 there is to be physically registered at 100 per 

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:52.890
 hundred lives of saints because 

00:02:50.909 --> 00:02:55.230
 today however it is normal that he did 

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:57.930
 starting from the first game after three 

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:58.290
 weeks of stop in physically a 

00:02:57.930 --> 00:02:59.910
 a little 

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:01.829
 it seemed he told him second 

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:05.810
 fat go out because he had a problem 

00:03:01.829 --> 00:03:08.430
 on the other hand, he can stay on the pitch 

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:09.870
 there is to record that I say that 

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:13.650
 the interest on our lost ball 

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:17.190
 that's why I pay you for 2 to 0 

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:18.750
 i have to be working on this thing but 

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:20.340
 especially waiting for the condition 

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:21.959
 of someone who improves and also 

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:23.579
 interests of the new ones we bought 

00:03:21.959 --> 00:03:26.220
 because today the nicola is no longer known 

00:03:23.579 --> 00:03:27.629
 did not play a game together no 

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:28.859
 I don't know one of those towns 

00:03:27.629 --> 00:03:33.870
 that we must work on the phase 

00:03:28.859 --> 00:03:36.480
 defensive in place of obstructing the 

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:38.700
 problem is not that it has been abolished 

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:42.090
 went close to the second pro position 

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:45.230
 fear of ribery 10 against 11 has lost 

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:47.239
 I thought of musacci with that 

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:49.489
 must understand that it can also start the 

00:03:47.239 --> 00:03:51.680
 offensive phase so it was just 

00:03:49.489 --> 00:03:55.670
 that change the word of little rivellins 

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:58.069
 ten years you said to note that the 

00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:59.930
 padova had not had these first games 

00:03:58.069 --> 00:04:01.549
 never launched the real long ball ever 

00:03:59.930 --> 00:04:05.060
 searched ball game on the ground or people of 

00:04:01.549 --> 00:04:06.739
 people and not because for the eighty for 

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:08.989
 one hundred that always tried to play ago 

00:04:06.739 --> 00:04:11.299
 the land then when the coastal heads to 

00:04:08.989 --> 00:04:13.910
 sometimes certain Italians even change of 

00:04:11.299 --> 00:04:15.829
 sell goes on but was not the 

00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:19.729
 our rest is a lube ball game 

00:04:15.829 --> 00:04:21.650
 the dark indeed I think it was a 

00:04:19.729 --> 00:04:23.090
 game maneuvered with actions 

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:24.500
 positive even in the first half 

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:26.120
 also known a performance of a 

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:27.020
 I listen, however, that is growing by 

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:31.039
 match in game 

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:32.389
 I wouldn't do dramas recreated the inter e 

00:04:31.039 --> 00:04:34.190
 great indications from this 

00:04:32.389 --> 00:04:36.830
 game because it makes me understand where I have to 

00:04:34.190 --> 00:04:40.100
 work something that still grows them 

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:45.340
 the team's physical condition and how 

00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:47.630
 as in the field for what I ask 

00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:48.949
 obviously sorry for the result that 

00:04:47.630 --> 00:04:50.389
 they had the pallata of an evening 

00:04:48.949 --> 00:04:52.130
 we had a ball he could do 

00:04:50.389 --> 00:04:54.320
 1 to 1 the Ticino one therefore linked 

00:04:52.130 --> 00:04:56.510
 the opportunity was ours 

00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:58.580
 more powerful we go out at the end of ho 

00:04:56.510 --> 00:04:59.960
 said boasting the hard hit of 

00:04:58.580 --> 00:05:02.030
 head that made a parallel 

00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:03.979
 and a close-up shot of being too 

00:05:02.030 --> 00:05:05.810
 billed north parade and therefore is not that 

00:05:03.979 --> 00:05:07.400
 they don't resist I would worry if not 

00:05:05.810 --> 00:05:10.639
 I had seen my team at 

00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:12.680
 search for the body of some 

00:05:10.639 --> 00:05:14.270
 geometries obviously in front of a 

00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:16.310
 say now that in the field has granted us 

00:05:14.270 --> 00:05:18.050
 too much has always been thought to have had one 

00:05:16.310 --> 00:05:19.520
 high defense 

00:05:18.050 --> 00:05:22.000
 sometimes it was even possible to take it 

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:23.990
 with playing fields that we are not 

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:25.610
 if I didn't have the others first 

00:05:23.990 --> 00:05:27.020
 time that in the morning life time that 

00:05:25.610 --> 00:05:29.120
 it ended so I wouldn't have believed it 

00:05:27.020 --> 00:05:31.340
 conclude a team that sought and that 

00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:33.289
 he had passions then decidedly 

00:05:31.340 --> 00:05:35.270
 he certainly broke the balance 

00:05:33.289 --> 00:05:37.639
 perhaps in the evening 2 also a result a 

00:05:35.270 --> 00:05:39.199
 little heavy for what going to a 

00:05:37.639 --> 00:05:41.780
 slightly above what it was 

00:05:39.199 --> 00:05:43.940
 something that exists in the field but 

00:05:41.780 --> 00:05:47.180
 especially at easter he played his thighs 

00:05:43.940 --> 00:05:48.860
 to the wind sing also from China to 

00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:51.259
 plot of this time they were coming 

00:05:48.860 --> 00:05:54.289
 but the other time one feels healthy 

00:05:51.259 --> 00:05:55.370
 this time on the 70th to 72nd mi 

00:05:54.289 --> 00:05:58.280
 It seems a thing 

00:05:55.370 --> 00:05:59.840
 so no one who becomes physical is 

00:05:58.280 --> 00:06:01.639
 growing from game to game also 

00:05:59.840 --> 00:06:03.919
 because then he becomes an important player 

00:06:01.639 --> 00:06:06.909
 so many of our sorties 

00:06:03.919 --> 00:06:06.909
 civilian farms 

00:06:09.260 --> 00:06:12.100
 to accept it 

00:06:12.870 --> 00:06:19.710
 where it is enormous that it will become so 

00:06:15.180 --> 00:06:24.300
 these things in his first post and the 

00:06:19.710 --> 00:06:25.560
 China claimed to hot at random we are 

00:06:24.300 --> 00:06:26.940
 all angry for what it is 

00:06:25.560 --> 00:06:29.100
 so we expected a success 

00:06:26.940 --> 00:06:32.340
 then a different partner project 

00:06:29.100 --> 00:06:33.630
 turned out to be what it seems 

00:06:32.340 --> 00:06:38.280
 just a whole technology are 

00:06:33.630 --> 00:06:38.940
 always built with regard to the 

00:06:38.280 --> 00:06:41.160
 defense 

00:06:38.940 --> 00:06:49.350
 specifically with the end it seems 

00:06:41.160 --> 00:06:51.030
 quite uncertain and all the parts that 

00:06:49.350 --> 00:06:52.710
 maybe he suffered a little bit there 

00:06:51.030 --> 00:06:54.390
 structures the recovery because also in 

00:06:52.710 --> 00:06:56.580
 I'm afraid to look at this forecast 

00:06:54.390 --> 00:06:59.550
 of rigor then I didn't do any 

00:06:56.580 --> 00:07:02.780
 pigeon parade so it's not me 

00:06:59.550 --> 00:07:05.040
 almost worries me of I know him well 

00:07:02.780 --> 00:07:06.360
 let's say the two normal courses five 

00:07:05.040 --> 00:07:08.730
 days for everything in the easy for a 

00:07:06.360 --> 00:07:12.750
 power when always for you with a 

00:07:08.730 --> 00:07:14.340
 striker find every month not by 

00:07:12.750 --> 00:07:22.310
 in this surely a thing that me 

00:07:14.340 --> 00:07:25.610
 worries they can then tax 

00:07:22.310 --> 00:07:28.350
 we people judge what they must 

00:07:25.610 --> 00:07:30.090
 you're probably a bit phases a 

00:07:28.350 --> 00:07:31.380
 own power according to you the photos because 

00:07:30.090 --> 00:07:32.880
 separated we are split into 

00:07:31.380 --> 00:07:33.450
 that incredible normal that he thinks of 

00:07:32.880 --> 00:07:37.380
 result 

00:07:33.450 --> 00:07:38.520
 I'm sorry for what we've decided 

00:07:37.380 --> 00:07:40.530
 that has split a bit in the balance 

00:07:38.520 --> 00:07:42.540
 why shots that can be many but 

00:07:40.530 --> 00:07:44.070
 I would not have believed it, however, this does 

00:07:42.540 --> 00:07:46.470
 part of our work we have to 

00:07:44.070 --> 00:07:47.910
 personality to look up but are 

00:07:46.470 --> 00:07:49.740
 sure i said the boys 

00:07:47.910 --> 00:07:51.420
 especially under that thought of 

00:07:49.740 --> 00:07:54.030
 what they have to give tonight 

00:07:51.420 --> 00:07:55.590
 physically altitude does not bother me 

00:07:54.030 --> 00:07:57.300
 there are other things we need to put 

00:07:55.590 --> 00:07:58.830
 definitely one of these is 

00:07:57.300 --> 00:08:00.180
 also the physical condition that must 

00:07:58.830 --> 00:08:05.370
 grow first tv per game 

00:08:00.180 --> 00:08:06.870
 and how to occupy the field anyway is 

00:08:05.370 --> 00:08:11.100
 normal that the first season is 

00:08:06.870 --> 00:08:14.180
 only the despairing results of 

00:08:11.100 --> 00:08:14.180
 decisions of these taxes 

00:08:15.350 --> 00:08:18.350
 thank you
