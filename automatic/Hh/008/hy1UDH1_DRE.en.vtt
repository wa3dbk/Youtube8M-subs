um<00:00:46.039> of<00:00:47.039> my<00:00:47.430> hair<00:00:47.850> out<00:00:48.090> so<00:00:50.690> I've<00:00:51.690> had<00:00:51.870> this<00:00:51.989> in

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
um of my hair out so I've had this in

um of my hair out so I've had this in
for<00:00:52.410> a<00:00:52.440> while<00:00:52.699> um<00:00:53.699> and<00:00:53.910> I<00:00:53.969> really<00:00:54.000> like<00:00:54.420> this

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:54.660 
for a while um and I really like this

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:58.880 
for a while um and I really like this
hair<00:00:55.199> it<00:00:55.500> doesn't<00:00:55.800> shed<00:00:56.340> like<00:00:57.329> um<00:00:57.859> you<00:00:58.859> know

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
hair it doesn't shed like um you know

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:02.810 
hair it doesn't shed like um you know
some<00:00:59.730> straight<00:01:00.300> hair<00:01:00.690> she<00:01:01.379> is<00:01:01.440> a<00:01:01.620> lot<00:01:01.980> and<00:01:02.309> I

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
some straight hair she is a lot and I

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:04.429 
some straight hair she is a lot and I
think<00:01:03.270> that<00:01:03.510> it<00:01:03.629> has<00:01:03.719> something<00:01:03.780> to<00:01:04.080> do<00:01:04.260> with

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:04.439 
think that it has something to do with

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:06.320 
think that it has something to do with
like<00:01:04.799> that<00:01:05.010> if<00:01:05.220> you<00:01:05.309> get<00:01:05.460> colored<00:01:05.880> hair<00:01:06.150> or

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
like that if you get colored hair or

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:08.030 
like that if you get colored hair or
whatever<00:01:06.510> it<00:01:06.780> cuz<00:01:06.930> like<00:01:07.110> I<00:01:07.229> got<00:01:07.439> colored<00:01:07.799> hair

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
whatever it cuz like I got colored hair

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:11.120 
whatever it cuz like I got colored hair
and<00:01:08.490> it<00:01:08.970> shed<00:01:09.270> like<00:01:09.659> crazy<00:01:10.080> so<00:01:10.650> I<00:01:10.680> guess<00:01:10.950> it

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
and it shed like crazy so I guess it

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:14.539 
and it shed like crazy so I guess it
doesn't<00:01:11.280> really<00:01:11.460> matter<00:01:11.729> what<00:01:12.240> um<00:01:12.740> brand<00:01:13.740> you

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549 
doesn't really matter what um brand you

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:16.399 
doesn't really matter what um brand you
get<00:01:14.760> if<00:01:15.030> you<00:01:15.150> stick<00:01:15.360> with<00:01:15.509> like<00:01:15.630> the<00:01:15.869> darkest
