00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:05.850
 so here we have the part on which we 

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:08.340
 usually sets the disc in 

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:11.490
 the soul or the knife so we will use 

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:12.990
 a head adapter that we fix everything 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:18.600
 just like the record to love the 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:21.060
 knife with the fangs of the disc so 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:24.269
 that's your nut that you use to 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:30.449
 fix your discs as the knife knives 

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:31.500
 so always hoist left no visa 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:33.390
 left like that when we start the 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:36.980
 machine it hangs 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:36.980
 that divide jama 

00:00:53.570 --> 00:01:01.520
 So here too there anything Rector 

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:08.470
 is positioned as the disk then 

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:12.800
 we're going to fix the movies we go flush on 

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:18.820
 the slots provided for this purpose so we 

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:18.820
 fold them in half and orchestrate them 

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:24.530
 so guys parties like that 

00:01:21.759 --> 00:01:26.810
 back on the niche 

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:28.759
 it allows to have a less sharp angle here 

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:32.300
 which makes it look good even when 

00:01:28.759 --> 00:01:35.060
 we miss canes where it avoids 

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:40.940
 the son has broken above the head is not it 

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:42.410
 put it like that instead of putting it in 

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:43.970
 wide across like that 

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:45.350
 which is sure the word cross like that 

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:47.149
 it can break will have the head as on 

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:51.619
 mobiles while the fact of them 

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:57.220
 put it like that it resists well 

00:01:51.619 --> 00:01:59.060
 level there the ring to fix the thread 

00:01:57.220 --> 00:02:01.009
 possibly to be confined to a machine 

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:02.000
 pretty powerful let's say from 

00:02:01.009 --> 00:02:05.119
 40 cubic centimeters 

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:06.619
 we can work on two floors 

00:02:05.119 --> 00:02:07.759
 there we will put the son one at 

00:02:06.619 --> 00:02:10.009
 above each other 

00:02:07.759 --> 00:02:12.410
 on each side so we will have two 

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:14.780
 wire floors which allows for this 

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:18.489
 called mulching, in other words 

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:21.799
 at 8 pm and jérôme royer the grass 

00:02:18.489 --> 00:02:23.720
 two stories in a row for the big ones will be 

00:02:21.799 --> 00:02:25.910
 120 m can floors since like that one 

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:27.230
 will have more power we will keep the 

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:28.400
 power to the machine but there for 

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:30.620
 to make grass we can attack on 

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:34.340
 two floors simply diners 

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:36.320
 this part there on the adapter so we 

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:39.320
 lives his left trifid life is without 

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:42.280
 too tight otherwise we will crush the wire there 

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:45.890
 was simply enough life these months there 

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:50.829
 so we're going to unscrew it to show if 

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:50.829
 please then my big darlings 

00:02:56.310 --> 00:03:03.310
 so here is the adapter is positioned 

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:10.120
 with the fangs of the disc just 

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:10.870
 screw the part with the son just 

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:17.280
 from him his two am simply 

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:17.280
 without tools and without forcing kovy his left 

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:23.580
 is finished by everything without forcing
