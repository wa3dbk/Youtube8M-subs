because this is organic stuff so while

00:02:16.769 --> 00:02:19.250 
because this is organic stuff so while
this<00:02:16.950> looks<00:02:17.189> really<00:02:17.670> really<00:02:17.879> pretty<00:02:18.139> it's<00:02:19.139> not

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:19.260 
this looks really really pretty it's not

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:20.780 
this looks really really pretty it's not
something<00:02:19.739> that<00:02:19.769> you<00:02:19.980> can<00:02:20.159> just<00:02:20.189> keep<00:02:20.489> around

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:20.790 
something that you can just keep around

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:22.849 
something that you can just keep around
like<00:02:20.999> you<00:02:21.120> would<00:02:21.239> a<00:02:21.299> regular<00:02:21.389> reborn<00:02:22.170> formula

00:02:22.849 --> 00:02:22.859 
like you would a regular reborn formula

00:02:22.859 --> 00:02:25.580 
like you would a regular reborn formula
bottle<00:02:23.010> so<00:02:23.930> if<00:02:24.930> you<00:02:25.109> wanted<00:02:25.290> to<00:02:25.409> look<00:02:25.530> pretty

00:02:38.509 --> 00:02:38.519 
just a multi pack of the plastic stuff

00:02:38.519 --> 00:02:40.819 
just a multi pack of the plastic stuff
that<00:02:38.700> goes<00:02:38.819> in<00:02:39.060> aquariums<00:02:39.510> and<00:02:39.870> you<00:02:40.500> can<00:02:40.650> mix

00:02:40.819 --> 00:02:40.829 
that goes in aquariums and you can mix

00:02:40.829 --> 00:02:42.949 
that goes in aquariums and you can mix
it<00:02:40.980> up<00:02:41.419> different<00:02:42.419> colors<00:02:42.540> different

00:02:42.949 --> 00:02:42.959 
it up different colors different

00:02:42.959 --> 00:02:43.580 
it up different colors different
textures

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:43.590 
textures

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:46.390 
textures
I<00:02:43.889> added<00:02:44.370> some<00:02:44.519> shells<00:02:44.939> there's<00:02:45.510> actually<00:02:45.930> I

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:46.400 
I added some shells there's actually I

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:49.369 
I added some shells there's actually I
got<00:02:47.400> these<00:02:47.579> shells<00:02:47.909> from<00:02:48.180> Michaels<00:02:48.659> and<00:02:48.930> I

00:03:27.559 --> 00:03:27.569 
and a couple of shells I will say the

00:03:27.569 --> 00:03:29.839 
and a couple of shells I will say the
shells<00:03:27.840> need<00:03:28.109> to<00:03:28.199> be<00:03:28.319> washed<00:03:28.560> before<00:03:29.280> you<00:03:29.669> put

them and some remnants of other shells

00:03:39.449 --> 00:03:41.210 
them and some remnants of other shells
that<00:03:39.689> may<00:03:39.780> have<00:03:39.900> broken<00:03:40.109> so<00:03:40.530> it<00:03:40.739> can<00:03:40.859> get<00:03:40.979> kind

00:03:41.210 --> 00:03:41.220 
that may have broken so it can get kind

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:44.300 
that may have broken so it can get kind
of<00:03:41.280> cloudy<00:03:41.519> on<00:03:41.819> the<00:03:41.909> bottom<00:03:42.180> I<00:03:42.389> just<00:03:43.229> did<00:03:44.129> this

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:44.310 
of cloudy on the bottom I just did this

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:45.679 
of cloudy on the bottom I just did this
one<00:03:44.489> but<00:03:44.669> it<00:03:44.759> can<00:03:44.879> get<00:03:45.000> kind<00:03:45.150> of<00:03:45.209> cloudy<00:03:45.419> on<00:03:45.599> the

00:03:45.679 --> 00:03:45.689 
one but it can get kind of cloudy on the

00:03:45.689 --> 00:03:48.559 
one but it can get kind of cloudy on the
bottom<00:03:45.930> if<00:03:46.019> you<00:03:46.109> don't<00:03:46.290> wash<00:03:46.470> them<00:03:46.680> so<00:03:47.639> wash

00:03:48.559 --> 00:03:48.569 
bottom if you don't wash them so wash

00:03:48.569 --> 00:03:50.420 
bottom if you don't wash them so wash
them<00:03:48.810> out<00:03:48.930> and<00:03:49.169> you<00:03:49.290> may<00:03:49.470> if<00:03:49.799> you<00:03:49.949> use<00:03:50.159> shells

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:50.430 
them out and you may if you use shells

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:52.009 
them out and you may if you use shells
you<00:03:50.639> may<00:03:50.759> have<00:03:50.939> to<00:03:51.060> change<00:03:51.329> the<00:03:51.540> water<00:03:51.689> every

00:03:52.009 --> 00:03:52.019 
you may have to change the water every

00:03:52.019 --> 00:03:54.619 
you may have to change the water every
once<00:03:52.979> in<00:03:53.069> a<00:03:53.159> while<00:03:53.280> but<00:03:53.790> you<00:03:53.849> can<00:03:54.120> just<00:03:54.329> kind<00:03:54.569> of

00:03:54.619 --> 00:03:54.629 
once in a while but you can just kind of

00:03:54.629 --> 00:03:56.479 
once in a while but you can just kind of
put<00:03:54.870> your<00:03:54.989> hand<00:03:55.290> over<00:03:55.469> the<00:03:55.709> top<00:03:55.919> and<00:03:56.129> let<00:03:56.189> just

00:03:56.479 --> 00:03:56.489 
put your hand over the top and let just

00:03:56.489 --> 00:03:58.550 
put your hand over the top and let just
a<00:03:56.579> little<00:03:56.790> bit<00:03:56.909> of<00:03:56.969> water<00:03:57.090> out<00:03:57.290> when<00:03:58.290> you<00:03:58.379> take

00:03:58.550 --> 00:03:58.560 
a little bit of water out when you take

00:03:58.560 --> 00:03:59.780 
a little bit of water out when you take
the<00:03:58.680> top<00:03:58.859> off<00:03:59.040> and<00:03:59.099> that<00:03:59.430> way<00:03:59.519> you<00:03:59.609> don't<00:03:59.699> have

00:03:59.780 --> 00:03:59.790 
the top off and that way you don't have

00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:04.309 
the top off and that way you don't have
to<00:03:59.969> rearrange<00:04:00.209> this<00:04:00.659> whole<00:04:00.900> thing<00:04:02.989> this<00:04:03.989> is<00:04:04.049> an

00:04:04.309 --> 00:04:04.319 
to rearrange this whole thing this is an

00:04:04.319 --> 00:04:05.990 
to rearrange this whole thing this is an
example<00:04:04.620> of<00:04:04.829> how<00:04:05.040> that<00:04:05.099> stuff<00:04:05.519> looks<00:04:05.759> in<00:04:05.939> a

00:04:05.990 --> 00:04:06.000 
example of how that stuff looks in a

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:10.429 
example of how that stuff looks in a
glass<00:04:06.299> bottle<00:04:06.810> and<00:04:08.509> it's<00:04:09.509> quite<00:04:10.049> a<00:04:10.079> bit<00:04:10.409> more

00:04:10.429 --> 00:04:10.439 
glass bottle and it's quite a bit more

00:04:10.439 --> 00:04:16.039 
glass bottle and it's quite a bit more
vibrant<00:04:12.079> so<00:04:13.079> I<00:04:14.060> probably<00:04:15.060> will<00:04:15.479> switch<00:04:15.810> her

00:04:16.039 --> 00:04:16.049 
vibrant so I probably will switch her

00:04:16.049 --> 00:04:18.199 
vibrant so I probably will switch her
over<00:04:16.349> to<00:04:16.560> just<00:04:16.769> glass<00:04:17.009> bottles<00:04:17.489> for<00:04:17.909> the

00:04:18.199 --> 00:04:18.209 
over to just glass bottles for the

00:04:18.209 --> 00:04:20.479 
over to just glass bottles for the
seaweed<00:04:18.959> type<00:04:19.169> of<00:04:19.320> bottles<00:04:19.620> there's<00:04:20.070> a<00:04:20.219> flower

00:04:20.479 --> 00:04:20.489 
seaweed type of bottles there's a flower

00:04:20.489 --> 00:04:23.330 
seaweed type of bottles there's a flower
there<00:04:20.820> too<00:04:21.139> this<00:04:22.139> is<00:04:22.289> all<00:04:22.440> plastic<00:04:22.650> these<00:04:23.279> are

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:23.340 
there too this is all plastic these are

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:24.620 
there too this is all plastic these are
all<00:04:23.550> plastic

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:24.630 
all plastic

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:27.620 
all plastic
plants<00:04:25.700> but<00:04:26.700> since<00:04:27.090> they<00:04:27.240> look<00:04:27.390> so<00:04:27.570> much

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:27.630 
plants but since they look so much

00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:30.320 
plants but since they look so much
better<00:04:27.870> in<00:04:27.990> the<00:04:28.140> glass<00:04:28.380> I'll<00:04:28.680> probably<00:04:29.330> switch

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:30.330 
better in the glass I'll probably switch

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:31.970 
better in the glass I'll probably switch
her<00:04:30.480> over<00:04:30.630> to<00:04:30.720> glass<00:04:30.930> for<00:04:31.260> these<00:04:31.380> and<00:04:31.650> just<00:04:31.740> use

00:04:31.970 --> 00:04:31.980 
her over to glass for these and just use

00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:35.540 
her over to glass for these and just use
the<00:04:32.220> plastic<00:04:32.820> ones<00:04:33.000> for<00:04:33.680> regular<00:04:34.680> formula<00:04:35.100> but

00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:35.550 
the plastic ones for regular formula but

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:39.530 
the plastic ones for regular formula but
yeah<00:04:36.590> that's<00:04:37.590> what<00:04:37.920> it<00:04:38.070> looks<00:04:38.280> like<00:04:38.580> and
