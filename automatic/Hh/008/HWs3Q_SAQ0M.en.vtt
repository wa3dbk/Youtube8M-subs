the<00:02:04.710> top<00:02:04.890> to<00:02:05.250> the<00:02:05.399> bottom<00:02:05.549> of<00:02:05.850> the<00:02:06.030> milk<00:02:06.240> carton

00:02:06.319 --> 00:02:06.329 
the top to the bottom of the milk carton

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:09.499 
the top to the bottom of the milk carton
do<00:02:07.170> not<00:02:07.380> cut<00:02:07.680> yet<00:02:08.009> just<00:02:08.310> pull<00:02:08.879> it<00:02:08.970> apart<00:02:09.090> gently

00:02:09.499 --> 00:02:09.509 
do not cut yet just pull it apart gently

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:12.560 
do not cut yet just pull it apart gently
and<00:02:09.989> then<00:02:10.440> cut<00:02:10.860> the<00:02:11.190> bottom<00:02:11.610> part

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:12.570 
and then cut the bottom part

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:14.540 
and then cut the bottom part
away<00:02:13.050> this<00:02:13.500> is<00:02:13.710> the<00:02:13.830> part<00:02:14.070> that<00:02:14.220> we're<00:02:14.370> not

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:14.550 
away this is the part that we're not

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:16.490 
away this is the part that we're not
going<00:02:14.850> to<00:02:14.880> be<00:02:14.970> going<00:02:15.360> to<00:02:15.480> use<00:02:15.750> so<00:02:15.990> that's<00:02:16.110> okay

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:16.500 
going to be going to use so that's okay

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:18.770 
going to be going to use so that's okay
if<00:02:16.680> you<00:02:16.740> go<00:02:16.980> a<00:02:17.010> little<00:02:17.130> rough<00:02:17.580> but<00:02:18.210> the<00:02:18.570> whole

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:18.780 
if you go a little rough but the whole

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:21.190 
if you go a little rough but the whole
point<00:02:19.050> here<00:02:19.260> is<00:02:19.320> to<00:02:19.740> have<00:02:20.010> the<00:02:20.310> milk<00:02:20.550> carton

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:21.200 
point here is to have the milk carton

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:25.160 
point here is to have the milk carton
become<00:02:22.200> a<00:02:22.380> flat<00:02:22.950> sheet<00:02:23.400> of<00:02:23.870> material<00:02:24.870> for<00:02:25.140> us

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:25.170 
become a flat sheet of material for us

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:27.890 
become a flat sheet of material for us
to<00:02:25.530> work<00:02:25.800> with<00:02:25.830> so<00:02:26.580> use<00:02:26.910> your<00:02:27.090> paper<00:02:27.300> towel<00:02:27.600> and

to work with so use your paper towel and

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:31.160 
to work with so use your paper towel and
clean<00:02:28.140> up<00:02:28.410> any<00:02:28.560> excess<00:02:29.070> water<00:02:29.940> you<00:02:30.690> might<00:02:30.870> have

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:31.170 
clean up any excess water you might have

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:33.110

at<00:02:31.380> the<00:02:31.500> bottom<00:02:31.860> of<00:02:32.040> the<00:02:32.220> milk<00:02:32.430> carton<00:02:32.520> and

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:33.120 
at the bottom of the milk carton and

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:36.740 
at the bottom of the milk carton and
then<00:02:33.780> place<00:02:34.200> your<00:02:34.440> pattern<00:02:34.740> on<00:02:35.160> top<00:02:35.970> and<00:02:36.330> you

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:36.750 
then place your pattern on top and you

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:38.720 
then place your pattern on top and you
want<00:02:37.050> to<00:02:37.200> use<00:02:37.440> the<00:02:37.650> spout<00:02:37.980> of<00:02:38.220> the<00:02:38.460> milk<00:02:38.670> carton

want to use the spout of the milk carton
as<00:02:39.300> a<00:02:39.330> guide<00:02:39.690> here<00:02:40.500> I'm<00:02:40.770> trimming<00:02:41.310> off<00:02:41.490> the<00:02:41.520> top

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:42.090 
as a guide here I'm trimming off the top

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:44.660 
as a guide here I'm trimming off the top
part<00:02:42.420> to<00:02:42.930> make<00:02:43.530> sure<00:02:43.680> that<00:02:43.830> we<00:02:44.010> have<00:02:44.250> a<00:02:44.280> nice

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:44.670 
part to make sure that we have a nice

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:48.860 
part to make sure that we have a nice
clean<00:02:45.330> edge<00:02:45.600> to<00:02:45.630> work<00:02:46.260> with<00:02:46.790> so<00:02:47.790> to<00:02:47.850> attach<00:02:48.570> the

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:48.870 
clean edge to work with so to attach the

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:50.870 
clean edge to work with so to attach the
pattern<00:02:49.230> I<00:02:49.440> use<00:02:49.680> those<00:02:49.920> small<00:02:50.220> paper<00:02:50.490> clips

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:50.880 
pattern I use those small paper clips

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:53.300 
pattern I use those small paper clips
you<00:02:51.720> don't<00:02:51.900> have<00:02:52.200> to<00:02:52.470> you<00:02:52.650> can<00:02:52.800> use<00:02:52.950> a<00:02:52.980> little

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:53.310 
you don't have to you can use a little

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:55.580 
you don't have to you can use a little
bit<00:02:53.430> of<00:02:53.580> tape<00:02:53.850> but<00:02:54.420> to<00:02:54.660> protect<00:02:55.020> your<00:02:55.230> pattern

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:55.590 
bit of tape but to protect your pattern

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:58.880 
bit of tape but to protect your pattern
you<00:02:55.770> want<00:02:56.340> to<00:02:56.810> use<00:02:57.810> some<00:02:58.020> kind<00:02:58.260> of<00:02:58.410> paper<00:02:58.650> clips

00:02:58.880 --> 00:02:58.890 
you want to use some kind of paper clips

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:02.240 
you want to use some kind of paper clips
like<00:02:59.250> this<00:02:59.550> it's<00:02:59.820> much<00:03:00.090> easier<00:03:00.630> so<00:03:01.530> in<00:03:01.890> order

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:02.250 
like this it's much easier so in order

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:05.270 
like this it's much easier so in order
to<00:03:02.700> have<00:03:03.030> the<00:03:03.180> pattern<00:03:03.600> on<00:03:03.780> our<00:03:04.230> material<00:03:05.010> I

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:05.280 
to have the pattern on our material I

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:09.280 
to have the pattern on our material I
use<00:03:05.610> a<00:03:05.790> marker<00:03:06.450> to<00:03:06.480> draw<00:03:07.440> the<00:03:07.590> pattern<00:03:08.220> onto

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:09.290 
use a marker to draw the pattern onto

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:12.050 
use a marker to draw the pattern onto
the<00:03:10.290> milk<00:03:10.560> carton<00:03:10.980> and<00:03:11.160> here<00:03:11.370> I'm<00:03:11.490> using<00:03:11.700> a

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:12.060 
the milk carton and here I'm using a

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:14.480 
the milk carton and here I'm using a
sharpie<00:03:12.570> this<00:03:13.050> way<00:03:13.290> again<00:03:13.740> we<00:03:13.950> can<00:03:14.130> protect

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:14.490 
sharpie this way again we can protect

00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:17.810 
sharpie this way again we can protect
our<00:03:14.760> pattern<00:03:15.600> and<00:03:15.780> what<00:03:16.620> I<00:03:16.650> do<00:03:16.770> is<00:03:17.190> to<00:03:17.580> put<00:03:17.790> a

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:17.820 
our pattern and what I do is to put a

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:20.650 
our pattern and what I do is to put a
little<00:03:18.180> tick<00:03:18.450> mark<00:03:18.750> at<00:03:18.959> the<00:03:19.500> end<00:03:19.530> of<00:03:19.950> those

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:20.660 
little tick mark at the end of those

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:23.930 
little tick mark at the end of those
sunburst<00:03:21.660> line<00:03:22.020> after<00:03:22.980> I<00:03:23.040> do<00:03:23.130> that<00:03:23.520> I<00:03:23.550> just

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:23.940 
sunburst line after I do that I just

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:26.510 
sunburst line after I do that I just
remove<00:03:24.209> the<00:03:24.600> pattern<00:03:24.990> and<00:03:25.170> extend<00:03:26.010> those<00:03:26.160> tick

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:26.520 
remove the pattern and extend those tick

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:29.510 
remove the pattern and extend those tick
marks<00:03:26.850> a<00:03:26.970> little<00:03:27.240> bit<00:03:27.500> into<00:03:28.500> the<00:03:28.620> pattern<00:03:29.040> so

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:29.520 
marks a little bit into the pattern so

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:31.790 
marks a little bit into the pattern so
now<00:03:29.790> you<00:03:29.850> can<00:03:30.209> cut<00:03:30.540> without<00:03:30.840> having<00:03:31.530> to<00:03:31.680> have

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:31.800 
now you can cut without having to have

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:35.510 
now you can cut without having to have
the<00:03:31.860> pattern<00:03:32.430> on<00:03:33.230> so<00:03:34.230> the<00:03:34.530> next<00:03:34.709> thing<00:03:34.890> I<00:03:34.980> do<00:03:35.040> is

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:35.520 
the pattern on so the next thing I do is

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:38.390 
the pattern on so the next thing I do is
to<00:03:35.940> use<00:03:36.209> a<00:03:36.240> pair<00:03:36.510> of<00:03:36.540> scissors<00:03:36.840> and<00:03:37.320> cut<00:03:37.400> along

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:38.400 
to use a pair of scissors and cut along

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:45.020 
to use a pair of scissors and cut along
the<00:03:39.120> line<00:03:39.360> that<00:03:39.600> we<00:03:39.720> just<00:03:39.959> draw<00:03:40.320> the<00:03:43.760> rest<00:03:44.760> of

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:45.030 
the line that we just draw the rest of

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:47.630 
the line that we just draw the rest of
the<00:03:45.180> milk<00:03:45.420> carton<00:03:45.680> can<00:03:46.680> be<00:03:46.830> discarded<00:03:47.250> we

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:47.640 
the milk carton can be discarded we

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:49.940 
the milk carton can be discarded we
don't<00:03:47.850> need<00:03:48.060> it<00:03:48.270> this<00:03:48.720> is<00:03:48.959> all<00:03:49.170> we<00:03:49.350> need<00:03:49.590> for

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:49.950 
don't need it this is all we need for

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:53.780 
don't need it this is all we need for
our<00:03:50.310> wallet<00:03:51.170> the<00:03:52.170> next<00:03:52.560> step<00:03:52.800> on<00:03:53.010> this<00:03:53.220> project

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:53.790 
our wallet the next step on this project

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:57.110 
our wallet the next step on this project
is<00:03:54.030> scoring<00:03:54.750> and<00:03:54.930> folding<00:03:55.740> you<00:03:56.280> can<00:03:56.459> see<00:03:56.670> here

00:03:57.110 --> 00:03:57.120 
is scoring and folding you can see here

00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:00.140 
is scoring and folding you can see here
that<00:03:57.240> I<00:03:57.300> laid<00:03:57.750> the<00:03:58.140> project<00:03:58.860> flat<00:03:59.160> onto<00:03:59.490> my

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:00.150 
that I laid the project flat onto my

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:02.210 
that I laid the project flat onto my
cutting<00:04:00.540> board<00:04:00.840> and<00:04:01.110> then<00:04:01.500> use<00:04:01.830> different

00:04:02.210 --> 00:04:02.220 
cutting board and then use different

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:05.390 
cutting board and then use different
material<00:04:02.880> to<00:04:03.090> create<00:04:03.300> a<00:04:03.660> score<00:04:04.230> line<00:04:04.440> after<00:04:05.340> I

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:05.400 
material to create a score line after I

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:07.699 
material to create a score line after I
finish<00:04:05.790> scoring<00:04:06.330> I<00:04:06.510> would<00:04:06.720> fold<00:04:07.170> it<00:04:07.440> to<00:04:07.680> make

00:04:07.699 --> 00:04:07.709 
finish scoring I would fold it to make

00:04:07.709 --> 00:04:10.160 
finish scoring I would fold it to make
sure<00:04:07.890> that<00:04:08.070> we<00:04:08.400> have<00:04:08.580> a<00:04:08.610> nice<00:04:08.970> and<00:04:09.330> crisp<00:04:09.750> line

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:10.170 
sure that we have a nice and crisp line

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:12.710 
sure that we have a nice and crisp line
and<00:04:10.470> this<00:04:11.070> part<00:04:11.370> is<00:04:11.489> very<00:04:11.580> important<00:04:12.480> because

00:04:12.710 --> 00:04:12.720 
and this part is very important because

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:15.440 
and this part is very important because
at<00:04:13.170> the<00:04:13.320> end<00:04:13.350> you<00:04:13.709> might<00:04:14.010> have<00:04:14.310> a<00:04:14.340> wallet<00:04:15.150> but

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:15.450 
at the end you might have a wallet but

00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:17.240 
at the end you might have a wallet but
it<00:04:15.630> will<00:04:15.750> be<00:04:15.930> all<00:04:16.109> wonky<00:04:16.470> if<00:04:16.890> you're<00:04:17.070> not

00:04:17.240 --> 00:04:17.250 
it will be all wonky if you're not

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:20.540 
it will be all wonky if you're not
scoring<00:04:17.940> these<00:04:18.299> line<00:04:18.690> nicely

in<00:04:20.730> between<00:04:21.660> I<00:04:21.810> choose<00:04:22.770> to<00:04:23.130> cut<00:04:23.550> out<00:04:23.760> these

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:24.030 
in between I choose to cut out these

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:26.690 
in between I choose to cut out these
circles<00:04:24.510> this<00:04:24.840> circles<00:04:25.380> is<00:04:25.560> going<00:04:25.980> to<00:04:26.220> be<00:04:26.400> the
