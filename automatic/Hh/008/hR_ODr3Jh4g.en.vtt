standards secondly they're priced very

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:30.220 
standards secondly they're priced very
reasonably<00:00:28.220> and<00:00:28.519> thirdly<00:00:29.269> they<00:00:29.750> have<00:00:29.900> a<00:00:29.930> high

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:30.230 
reasonably and thirdly they have a high

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:32.950 
reasonably and thirdly they have a high
degree<00:00:30.260> of<00:00:31.029> functionality<00:00:32.029> all<00:00:32.570> right<00:00:32.689> let's

00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:32.960 
degree of functionality all right let's

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:35.380 
degree of functionality all right let's
talk<00:00:33.140> about<00:00:33.199> this<00:00:33.620> functionality<00:00:34.519> a<00:00:34.550> bit<00:00:34.910> if

00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:35.390 
talk about this functionality a bit if

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:37.660 
talk about this functionality a bit if
you<00:00:35.780> have<00:00:35.809> to<00:00:36.200> think<00:00:36.530> about<00:00:36.739> raising<00:00:37.250> and

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:37.670 
you have to think about raising and

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:40.060 
you have to think about raising and
lowering<00:00:37.700> a<00:00:38.239> shield<00:00:38.600> if<00:00:38.899> you<00:00:39.410> have<00:00:39.620> to<00:00:39.829> think

00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:40.070 
lowering a shield if you have to think

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:43.330 
lowering a shield if you have to think
about<00:00:40.340> how<00:00:40.670> vents<00:00:41.180> open<00:00:41.329> and<00:00:41.870> close<00:00:42.170> visors<00:00:43.040> go

00:00:43.330 --> 00:00:43.340 
about how vents open and close visors go

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:45.369 
about how vents open and close visors go
up<00:00:43.550> and<00:00:43.790> down<00:00:43.940> that's<00:00:44.629> not<00:00:44.809> a<00:00:44.840> functional

00:00:45.369 --> 00:00:45.379 
up and down that's not a functional

00:00:45.379 --> 00:00:47.560 
up and down that's not a functional
helmet<00:00:45.739> that<00:00:46.309> takes<00:00:46.579> your<00:00:46.730> eyes<00:00:46.969> off<00:00:47.329> the<00:00:47.360> road

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:47.570 
helmet that takes your eyes off the road

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:50.229 
helmet that takes your eyes off the road
it<00:00:48.230> takes<00:00:48.500> your<00:00:48.680> mind<00:00:48.710> off<00:00:49.219> their<00:00:49.520> route<00:00:49.700> now

00:00:50.229 --> 00:00:50.239 
it takes your mind off their route now

00:00:50.239 --> 00:00:51.430 
it takes your mind off their route now
those<00:00:50.570> of<00:00:50.600> you<00:00:50.840> who<00:00:51.079> are<00:00:51.170> a<00:00:51.200> little<00:00:51.289> more

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:51.440 
those of you who are a little more

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:54.970 
those of you who are a little more
observant<00:00:52.329> may<00:00:53.329> see<00:00:53.930> that<00:00:54.140> I<00:00:54.260> have<00:00:54.440> a<00:00:54.469> bag<00:00:54.770> of

my head and I'm also wearing gloves now

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:59.049 
my head and I'm also wearing gloves now
I'm<00:00:57.350> doing<00:00:57.590> this<00:00:57.920> to<00:00:58.190> illustrate<00:00:58.820> the

00:00:59.049 --> 00:00:59.059 
I'm doing this to illustrate the

00:00:59.059 --> 00:01:02.680 
I'm doing this to illustrate the
functionality<00:00:59.930> of<00:01:00.079> our<00:01:00.739> FF<00:01:01.190> 386<00:01:01.850> because<00:01:02.539> when

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:02.690 
functionality of our FF 386 because when

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:04.240 
functionality of our FF 386 because when
you're<00:01:02.809> wearing<00:01:03.020> a<00:01:03.199> helmet<00:01:03.350> you<00:01:03.590> can't<00:01:04.009> see

00:01:04.240 --> 00:01:04.250 
you're wearing a helmet you can't see

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:05.049 
you're wearing a helmet you can't see
the<00:01:04.430> controls

00:01:05.049 --> 00:01:05.059 
the controls

00:01:05.059 --> 00:01:07.660 
the controls
hence<00:01:05.539> the<00:01:05.810> bag<00:01:06.020> and<00:01:06.259> of<00:01:06.680> course<00:01:06.710> you'll<00:01:07.520> be

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:07.670 
hence the bag and of course you'll be

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:08.469 
hence the bag and of course you'll be
wearing<00:01:08.030> gloves

00:01:08.469 --> 00:01:08.479 
wearing gloves

00:01:08.479 --> 00:01:11.050 
wearing gloves
all<00:01:08.720> right<00:01:09.110> for<00:01:09.320> example<00:01:09.770> raising<00:01:10.520> the<00:01:10.790> shield

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:11.060 
all right for example raising the shield

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:13.750 
all right for example raising the shield
simple<00:01:11.750> enough<00:01:11.990> operation<00:01:12.710> we<00:01:13.340> make<00:01:13.549> it<00:01:13.700> a

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:13.760 
simple enough operation we make it a

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:15.940 
simple enough operation we make it a
little<00:01:13.939> bit<00:01:14.150> more<00:01:14.510> simple<00:01:14.900> on<00:01:15.229> the<00:01:15.500> left<00:01:15.710> hand

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:15.950 
little bit more simple on the left hand

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:18.429 
little bit more simple on the left hand
side<00:01:16.280> of<00:01:16.430> the<00:01:16.490> shield<00:01:16.729> there's<00:01:17.299> a<00:01:17.479> tab<00:01:17.750> which

00:01:18.429 --> 00:01:18.439 
side of the shield there's a tab which

00:01:18.439 --> 00:01:21.760 
side of the shield there's a tab which
is<00:01:18.470> easily<00:01:19.159> found<00:01:19.400> by<00:01:19.670> your<00:01:19.939> gloved<00:01:20.270> hand<00:01:20.770> now

00:01:56.620 --> 00:01:56.630 
should be very intuitive for example our

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:59.280 
should be very intuitive for example our
front<00:01:57.079> vents<00:01:57.590> operate<00:01:58.220> just<00:01:58.460> like<00:01:58.610> your<00:01:58.970> mouth

00:01:59.280 --> 00:01:59.290
