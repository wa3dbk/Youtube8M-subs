00:00:09.580 --> 00:00:15.150
 very good people here is again a 

00:00:12.430 --> 00:00:17.820
 new extreme gameplay 2 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:18.750
 What he had promised was to play a 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:22.370
 mission 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:25.490
 in alaska all this is mission number one 

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:27.020
 so let's start if what you 

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:29.770
 has counted the first missionary with 

00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:33.330
 this change does not remove snow 

00:00:29.770 --> 00:00:33.330
 it seems interesting 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:40.340
 Unfortunately, I do not know how many 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:40.340
 missions be here 

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:45.950
 one day I think it's the 30 missions 

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:48.560
 I think good I think these 

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:52.180
 missions should be equally 

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:52.180
 strong that always the last mission 

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:57.000
 country 

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:58.950
 in this alaska broadway game 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.650
 It is always an ultra big load 

00:00:58.950 --> 00:01:03.210
 project that of africa that 

00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:05.810
 I think it 's a hand 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:08.930
 Panama 

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:11.990
 5 to 6 trailers is quite long and that 

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:14.810
 It is the last mission that touches 

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:16.220
 and in this space the same almost almost 

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:18.270
 same 

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:21.290
 so 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:24.920
 until the first mission 

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:26.000
 and it will be going up varied and I know that 

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:28.520
 have promised him that he was going to climb 

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:30.380
 only and thinks that it will rescue sample 

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:32.780
 how are we with another 

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:34.310
 but good simple boring always 

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:36.229
 home of the wind 

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:38.340
 that's why we're going to be going up and 

00:01:36.229 --> 00:01:41.390
 variously 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:41.390
 Of each country 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:46.520
 there are quickly 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:48.320
 fast 

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:51.870
 and kept talking and I have the game 

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:53.550
 of Spain within it 

00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:56.030
 these days I'm assuming the first 

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:59.840
 mini play 

00:01:56.030 --> 00:02:03.890
 what I do not like the game logically 

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:05.350
 if they are only challenges tests but good for 

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:09.060
 you 

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:09.060
 do not buy at a cheap 

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:16.860
 well, decide to buy it 

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:18.569
 human watching if borges 

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:23.650
 it happened to me 

00:02:18.569 --> 00:02:25.420
 it's one of the challenges that you get in the game 

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:28.230
 On the one hand, I find it interesting 

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:30.360
 there are also challenges that for example 

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:34.590
 for not giving me 

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:36.930
 crashing good do a quantity of 

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:39.269
 challenges in it 

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:42.840
 the scanned the same line so 

00:02:39.269 --> 00:02:46.580
 soon they will be going too that god 

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:46.580
 we had been earlier 

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:50.569
 on ice that already smells brothers 

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:57.540
 of whether to erase it because for me it's almost 

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:59.430
 same as the 2 although logically 

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:02.780
 marianist 

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:05.100
 he almost does not care 

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:08.540
 for my book 

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:08.540
 almost the same three for you 

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:12.860
 a lady 

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:16.530
 they also get wet 2 

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:19.020
 of shopping or downloading what went into 

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:21.660
 trailers missing seats divisions 

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:23.790
 but for him as I already say is 

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:26.489
 similar then why 

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:28.950
 I do not know maybe 100 are different challenges 

00:03:26.489 --> 00:03:30.420
 so for the moment we're left with 

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:33.299
 the seat of dibise simulation and 

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:37.290
 then we look if we can give the other 

00:03:33.299 --> 00:03:39.590
 yes but not step by step to not 

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:42.410
 Complicate 

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:45.980
 remember that I 

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:48.410
 of this new newspaper so I 

00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:51.070
 go back to being what was yesterday's part 

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:51.070
 you can not hear 

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:56.060
 because it 's pretty busy I ask you 

00:03:53.989 --> 00:03:58.489
 apologies and suddenly stopped going up a 

00:03:56.060 --> 00:04:00.940
 video but I will always try to upload two 

00:03:58.489 --> 00:04:00.940
 videos 

00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:04.190
 and always before a video position 

00:04:02.740 --> 00:04:05.990
 teeth 

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:08.990
 but for another wind 

00:04:05.990 --> 00:04:08.990
 2. 3 

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:14.830
 let's go so the right always touched me 

00:04:11.350 --> 00:04:20.160
 this time I will continue to right 

00:04:14.830 --> 00:04:20.160
 other routes to that fear more right 

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:29.189
 you are pretty fast 

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:40.350
 lately not to pass 

00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:52.900
 this for this river 

00:05:03.590 --> 00:05:09.009
 so 

00:05:06.190 --> 00:05:11.800
 agree that the first mission is 

00:05:09.009 --> 00:05:13.990
 the alaska part will also be 

00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:18.430
 playing what is the mountain there are also 

00:05:13.990 --> 00:05:19.569
 a mountain and it's recording though this 

00:05:18.430 --> 00:05:22.389
 I have not been given it 

00:05:19.569 --> 00:05:24.309
 we hope it will balance some other 

00:05:22.389 --> 00:05:25.599
 missions month block already what is the 

00:05:24.309 --> 00:05:29.460
 part of mountain 

00:05:25.599 --> 00:05:29.460
 and of those in the USA 

00:05:30.449 --> 00:05:34.080
 I already have almost all of the blog that 

00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:37.310
 had I have india 

00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:39.920
 africa brazil 

00:05:37.310 --> 00:05:43.240
 and alaska and I was missing mountain alone is the 

00:05:39.920 --> 00:05:43.240
 only thing I need to finish 

00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:50.630
 to be able to complete if you do 

00:05:46.350 --> 00:05:50.630
 variably a gameplay of each 

00:05:53.080 --> 00:05:57.220
 we would not arrive now that he has 

00:05:55.569 --> 00:05:59.349
 arrived in good weather the pac and 

00:05:57.220 --> 00:06:03.659
 having quite right said this in 

00:05:59.349 --> 00:06:03.659
 against him they touch him quickly 

00:06:12.670 --> 00:06:17.230
 all right 

00:06:14.830 --> 00:06:21.810
 then we come to our first 

00:06:17.230 --> 00:06:21.810
 vision of wings 

00:06:23.320 --> 00:06:28.570
 As always, say subscribe to your questions 

00:06:26.290 --> 00:06:30.600
 anything in the excretion of the video 

00:06:28.570 --> 00:06:34.360
 It makes me really comment 

00:06:30.600 --> 00:06:36.600
 subscribe to the official youtube of games 

00:06:34.360 --> 00:06:36.600
 simulation
