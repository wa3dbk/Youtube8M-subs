sort of a fifth inversion box shape if
you<00:01:05.059> will<00:01:05.269> the<00:01:05.449> other<00:01:05.630> position<00:01:06.140> is<00:01:06.530> just

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:07.100 
you will the other position is just

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:16.450 
string and we're going to play the next

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:18.360 
string and we're going to play the next
three<00:02:17.140> strings<00:02:17.470> work<00:02:17.650> with<00:02:17.830> the<00:02:17.920> pentatonic

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:18.370 
three strings work with the pentatonic

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:21.660 
three strings work with the pentatonic
14<00:02:19.300> 12<00:02:19.570> on<00:02:19.720> the<00:02:19.810> third<00:02:20.020> 14<00:02:20.890> 12<00:02:21.190> on<00:02:21.310> the<00:02:21.400> fourth

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:21.670 
14 12 on the third 14 12 on the fourth

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:33.570 
14 12 on the third 14 12 on the fourth
and<00:02:21.940> 14<00:02:22.750> 12<00:02:22.960> of<00:02:23.200> fifth<00:02:24.510> from<00:02:25.510> the<00:02:25.570> start<00:02:32.580> when

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:33.580 
and 14 12 of fifth from the start when

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:34.920 
and 14 12 of fifth from the start when
we<00:02:33.670> speed<00:02:33.910> up<00:02:34.060> the<00:02:34.210> point<00:02:34.390> when<00:02:34.600> I<00:02:34.630> keep<00:02:34.810> the

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:34.930 
we speed up the point when I keep the

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:36.660 
we speed up the point when I keep the
gasps<00:02:35.110> I'm<00:02:35.380> just<00:02:35.560> trying<00:02:35.770> to<00:02:35.800> chunk<00:02:36.310> it<00:02:36.430> for

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:36.670 
gasps I'm just trying to chunk it for

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:36.960 
gasps I'm just trying to chunk it for
you<00:02:36.760> guys

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:36.970 
you guys

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:39.180 
you guys
the<00:02:37.810> last<00:02:38.020> group<00:02:38.230> from<00:02:38.500> this<00:02:38.680> shape<00:02:38.920> the

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:39.190 
the last group from this shape the

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:41.280 
the last group from this shape the
pentatonic<00:02:39.610> is<00:02:40.060> going<00:02:40.300> to<00:02:40.360> have<00:02:40.450> 14<00:02:40.780> 12<00:02:41.080> on<00:02:41.230> the

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:41.290 
pentatonic is going to have 14 12 on the

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:43.740 
pentatonic is going to have 14 12 on the
fourth<00:02:41.560> for<00:02:42.130> C<00:02:42.280> 12<00:02:42.550> of<00:02:42.700> the<00:02:42.820> fifth<00:02:43.060> and<00:02:43.360> at

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:43.750 
fourth for C 12 of the fifth and at

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:46.370 
fourth for C 12 of the fifth and at
fifteen<00:02:44.140> twelve<00:02:44.350> on<00:02:44.500> the<00:02:44.530> sixth<00:02:44.860> string

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:46.380 
fifteen twelve on the sixth string

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:52.110 
fifteen twelve on the sixth string
altogether

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:52.120 

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:54.730 

okay<00:02:53.120> then<00:02:53.330> I<00:02:53.390> jump<00:02:53.630> to<00:02:53.810> the<00:02:53.930> pentatonic<00:02:54.590> shape

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:54.740 
okay then I jump to the pentatonic shape

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:57.899 
okay then I jump to the pentatonic shape
behind<00:02:55.280> it<00:02:55.490> which<00:02:55.610> is<00:02:55.640> this<00:02:55.910> one

00:02:57.899 --> 00:02:57.909 
behind it which is this one

00:02:57.909 --> 00:03:00.149 
behind it which is this one
oh<00:02:57.939> so<00:02:58.450> it's<00:02:58.599> kind<00:02:58.840> of<00:02:58.930> v<00:02:59.260> shape<00:02:59.680> you'll<00:02:59.950> have

00:03:00.149 --> 00:03:00.159 
oh so it's kind of v shape you'll have

00:03:00.159 --> 00:03:00.869 
oh so it's kind of v shape you'll have
to<00:03:00.280> deal<00:03:00.489> with

00:03:00.869 --> 00:03:00.879 
to deal with

00:03:00.879 --> 00:03:02.910 
to deal with
maybe<00:03:01.180> starting<00:03:01.659> from<00:03:01.870> an<00:03:02.049> E<00:03:02.170> minor<00:03:02.379> and<00:03:02.769> it

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:02.920 
maybe starting from an E minor and it

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:04.979 
maybe starting from an E minor and it
works<00:03:03.099> its<00:03:03.310> way<00:03:03.430> up<00:03:03.459> to<00:03:03.700> scale<00:03:03.939> you<00:03:04.569> end<00:03:04.840> up

00:03:04.979 --> 00:03:04.989 
works its way up to scale you end up

00:03:04.989 --> 00:03:07.890 
works its way up to scale you end up
here<00:03:05.230> on<00:03:05.409> day<00:03:05.650> just<00:03:05.950> before<00:03:06.099> repeating<00:03:06.870> so<00:03:07.870> I

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:09.700 
want to do this box over the pentatonic

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:11.849 
want to do this box over the pentatonic
I'm<00:03:09.909> going<00:03:10.030> to<00:03:10.090> buy<00:03:10.209> ten<00:03:10.510> twelve<00:03:10.810> on<00:03:11.049> the<00:03:11.560> sixth

00:03:11.849 --> 00:03:11.859 
I'm going to buy ten twelve on the sixth

00:03:11.859 --> 00:03:15.330 
I'm going to buy ten twelve on the sixth
string<00:03:11.950> and<00:03:12.370> the<00:03:12.459> 50mm<00:03:13.420> I<00:03:14.290> send<00:03:14.890> this<00:03:14.980> all<00:03:15.220> the

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:15.340 
string and the 50mm I send this all the

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:19.009 
string and the 50mm I send this all the
way<00:03:15.459> I<00:03:15.489> would<00:03:15.790> have<00:03:15.879> a<00:03:16.030> nine<00:03:16.269> twelve<00:03:16.659> on<00:03:16.870> four

00:03:19.009 --> 00:03:19.019 
way I would have a nine twelve on four

way I would have a nine twelve on four
okay<00:03:20.019> I<00:03:20.290> jump<00:03:20.560> back<00:03:20.620> to<00:03:20.739> the<00:03:20.890> fifth<00:03:21.099> string<00:03:21.220> and

00:03:21.569 --> 00:03:21.579 
okay I jump back to the fifth string and

00:03:21.579 --> 00:03:23.849 
okay I jump back to the fifth string and
on<00:03:21.640> a<00:03:21.670> plate<00:03:21.970> ten<00:03:22.209> twelve<00:03:22.540> there<00:03:22.810> and<00:03:23.500> then<00:03:23.680> I

00:03:23.849 --> 00:03:23.859

00:03:34.389 --> 00:03:36.059 
want to jump back to the fourth string
I'm<00:03:34.840> going<00:03:34.959> to<00:03:35.049> play<00:03:35.170> nine<00:03:35.409> twelve<00:03:35.799> their

00:03:36.059 --> 00:03:36.069 
I'm going to play nine twelve their

00:03:36.069 --> 00:03:38.429 
I'm going to play nine twelve their
ninth<00:03:36.639> of<00:03:37.060> the<00:03:37.090> third<00:03:37.450> and<00:03:37.900> then<00:03:38.200> turns

00:03:38.429 --> 00:03:38.439 
ninth of the third and then turns

00:03:38.439 --> 00:03:44.699 
ninth of the third and then turns
forward<00:03:38.650> on<00:03:38.769> the<00:03:38.859> second<00:03:40.019> all<00:03:41.019> together<00:03:43.709> and

00:03:44.699 --> 00:03:44.709 
forward on the second all together and

00:03:44.709 --> 00:03:46.289 
forward on the second all together and
the<00:03:45.010> last<00:03:45.159> little<00:03:45.459> chunk<00:03:45.760> I<00:03:45.879> do<00:03:45.939> is<00:03:46.150> going<00:03:46.239> to

00:03:46.289 --> 00:03:46.299 
the last little chunk I do is going to

00:03:46.299 --> 00:03:48.509 
the last little chunk I do is going to
grow<00:03:46.419> 9/4<00:03:46.959> on<00:03:47.079> the<00:03:47.200> third<00:03:47.409> tenfold<00:03:48.129> on<00:03:48.430> the

grow 9/4 on the third tenfold on the
second<00:03:48.879> ten<00:03:49.030> twelve<00:03:49.269> the<00:03:49.419> first<00:03:50.370> so<00:03:51.370> I'm<00:03:51.489> going

00:03:51.509 --> 00:03:51.519 
second ten twelve the first so I'm going

00:03:51.519 --> 00:03:56.399 
second ten twelve the first so I'm going
to<00:03:51.700> gather<00:03:51.849> of<00:03:52.030> the<00:03:52.120> ascending<00:03:52.569> run

00:03:56.399 --> 00:03:56.409 

00:03:56.409 --> 00:03:58.360 

relatively<00:03:57.409> predictable<00:03:57.709> but<00:03:58.099> it's<00:03:58.220> pretty

00:03:58.360 --> 00:03:58.370 
relatively predictable but it's pretty

00:03:58.370 --> 00:03:59.979 
relatively predictable but it's pretty
cool<00:03:58.670> to<00:03:59.030> speed<00:03:59.360> building<00:03:59.720> on<00:03:59.810> your<00:03:59.930> right

00:03:59.979 --> 00:03:59.989 
cool to speed building on your right

00:03:59.989 --> 00:04:01.960 
cool to speed building on your right
hand<00:04:00.409> so<00:04:00.650> let's<00:04:01.010> do<00:04:01.129> it<00:04:01.159> relatively<00:04:01.640> slowly

00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:01.970 
hand so let's do it relatively slowly

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:04.630 
hand so let's do it relatively slowly
and<00:04:02.269> then<00:04:02.420> again<00:04:02.720> close<00:04:03.140> up<00:04:03.349> with<00:04:03.530> some<00:04:03.680> taps

00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:04.640 
and then again close up with some taps
