00:03:43.710 --> 00:03:43.720 
draw a fairly thick line since we are

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:46.110 
draw a fairly thick line since we are
going<00:03:43.900> to<00:03:43.959> be<00:03:44.050> putting<00:03:44.230> on<00:03:44.440> lashes<00:03:44.739> but<00:03:45.730> if<00:03:46.000> you

00:03:54.490 --> 00:03:54.500 

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:59.000 

so<00:03:55.500> just<00:03:55.739> start<00:03:55.980> close<00:03:56.370> to<00:03:56.550> your<00:03:56.670> lashes<00:03:58.010> work

00:03:59.000 --> 00:03:59.010 
so just start close to your lashes work

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:00.830 
so just start close to your lashes work
on<00:03:59.190> that<00:03:59.370> line<00:03:59.610> go<00:03:59.879> all<00:03:59.970> the<00:04:00.390> way<00:04:00.420> to<00:04:00.599> the<00:04:00.720> inner

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:00.840 
on that line go all the way to the inner

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:22.080 
on that line go all the way to the inner
corner

00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:22.090 

00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:24.600 

and<00:04:22.480> then<00:04:22.780> as<00:04:22.930> you<00:04:22.960> get<00:04:23.199> out<00:04:23.410> words<00:04:23.680> more<00:04:24.010> you

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:24.610 
and then as you get out words more you

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:31.800 
and then as you get out words more you
can<00:04:24.730> make<00:04:24.910> it<00:04:25.030> a<00:04:25.090> bit<00:04:25.270> thicker<00:04:30.479> all<00:04:31.479> right<00:04:31.660> so

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:31.810 
can make it a bit thicker all right so

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:33.090 
can make it a bit thicker all right so
