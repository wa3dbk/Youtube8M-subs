00:00:00.589 --> 00:00:08.160
 and welcome to the classic 6 

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:10.440
 and today it's against the mine or 

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:13.799
 rather , in the mine as it is 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:20.789
 officially called so let's go to 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:24.119
 mine and company marissa is 10 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:27.410
 he can not you be free hugo 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:27.410
 never defeat me 

00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:37.210
 happy out 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:48.080
 I see all the kids helping Hugo 

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:48.080
 want 

00:00:54.829 --> 00:01:10.299
 hugo war his hugo wiener sew her 

00:00:57.409 --> 00:01:10.299
 I want to see it there 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:20.509
 this time ends so on we go 

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:20.509
 it's 

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:34.039
 soja, he falls softly, which makes clear 

00:01:34.189 --> 00:01:51.500
 yes, yes, I had indeed pressed 

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:51.500
 that's how it works 2 though 

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:56.580
 so 

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:10.940
 with the four films is enough only loud leaf 

00:02:03.829 --> 00:02:11.930
 04 then this is nothing but stops 

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:15.400
 the problem was 

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:15.400
 we may not be long breaks a 

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:24.760
 it may not be shown or marwitz 

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:28.030
 maybe not 

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:37.450
 really too soon it is already coming 

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:46.530
 the last gate mobile is the end 

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:46.530
 because we are constantly pressing too early 

00:02:54.450 --> 00:03:05.940
 so we have to do a bit better now 

00:02:56.680 --> 00:03:05.940
 share and so on 

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:12.760
 2 

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:29.010
 from 4 

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:44.890
 vol 

00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:53.340
 and here 

00:03:56.670 --> 00:03:59.670
 Yes 

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:10.200
 jol was like the river 

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:26.520
 now comes 

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:43.000
 at one rope you will already 

00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:45.490
 We'll just lose this time 

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:49.260
 with the clubs nowotny have taken the 

00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:49.260
 three times what happens there 

00:04:55.229 --> 00:05:01.569
 shit everyone at the game hammer a few 

00:04:59.229 --> 00:05:04.229
 technology also makes my troll 

00:05:01.569 --> 00:05:04.229
 white train 

00:05:04.590 --> 00:05:15.460
 yes, we can play this game 

00:05:13.420 --> 00:05:18.360
 900 points would have been nice 

00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:21.580
 horrified there have been more 

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:24.790
 luck would be but unfortunately we will 

00:05:21.580 --> 00:05:27.150
 no one can go last we 

00:05:24.790 --> 00:05:29.710
 now in the moor 

00:05:27.150 --> 00:05:31.930
 yes, I'll hold on now 

00:05:29.710 --> 00:05:33.610
 Favorite label is the stupid would 

00:05:31.930 --> 00:05:35.770
 after that comes the skateboard and on 

00:05:33.610 --> 00:05:37.240
 third place is tomorrow, yes 

00:05:35.770 --> 00:05:39.580
 that's why the book comes here too 

00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:42.400
 Finally I have done something extra 

00:05:39.580 --> 00:05:46.750
 as it is now in the moor at max 

00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:49.470
 mara so until then when it says it works 

00:05:46.750 --> 00:05:49.470
 In the morning
