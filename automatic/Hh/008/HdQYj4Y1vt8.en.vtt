00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720 
sweaty you know pass backs across goal

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:39.950 
sweaty you know pass backs across goal
uh<00:01:36.890> but<00:01:37.890> I<00:01:37.950> switched<00:01:38.490> to<00:01:38.610> a<00:01:38.700> 4321<00:01:39.689> formation

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
uh but I switched to a 4321 formation

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:42.109 
uh but I switched to a 4321 formation
and<00:01:40.650> I've<00:01:40.710> got<00:01:40.950> to<00:01:41.100> say<00:01:41.250> it<00:01:41.369> is<00:01:41.520> working<00:01:41.880> out

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:42.119 
and I've got to say it is working out

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:44.210 
and I've got to say it is working out
for<00:01:42.329> me<00:01:42.360> there's<00:01:43.200> a<00:01:43.259> reason<00:01:43.710> why<00:01:43.979> that

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:44.220 
for me there's a reason why that

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:46.010 
for me there's a reason why that
formation<00:01:44.640> card<00:01:45.030> is<00:01:45.149> more<00:01:45.390> expensive<00:01:45.570> than

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
formation card is more expensive than

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:48.710 
formation card is more expensive than
the<00:01:46.079> 4411<00:01:46.799> card<00:01:47.310> which<00:01:47.520> I<00:01:47.670> actually<00:01:47.850> do<00:01:48.299> use<00:01:48.509> at

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:48.720 
the 4411 card which I actually do use at

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:50.179 
the 4411 card which I actually do use at
least<00:01:48.750> that's<00:01:49.049> my<00:01:49.110> opinion<00:01:49.320> at<00:01:49.680> this<00:01:49.799> point

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:50.189 
least that's my opinion at this point

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:52.460 
least that's my opinion at this point
who<00:01:50.610> knows<00:01:50.670> it<00:01:51.000> could<00:01:51.030> be<00:01:51.240> different<00:01:51.420> a<00:01:51.750> month

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:52.470 
who knows it could be different a month

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:54.289 
who knows it could be different a month
from<00:01:52.530> now<00:01:52.649> a<00:01:52.770> week<00:01:53.159> from<00:01:53.310> now<00:01:53.520> we<00:01:53.820> just<00:01:54.060> never
