store I used to buy orange juice from
the<00:00:44.280> store<00:00:44.489> but<00:00:44.670> then<00:00:44.850> I<00:00:44.940> found<00:00:45.120> out<00:00:45.420> that

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:45.920 
the store but then I found out that

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:47.990 
the store but then I found out that
orange<00:00:46.920> juice<00:00:46.980> from<00:00:47.219> the<00:00:47.340> store<00:00:47.550> really<00:00:47.730> is

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
orange juice from the store really is

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.420 
orange juice from the store really is
not<00:00:48.180> that<00:00:48.360> healthy<00:00:48.980> we<00:00:49.980> are<00:00:50.010> led<00:00:50.250> to<00:00:50.340> believe

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
not that healthy we are led to believe

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:51.979 
not that healthy we are led to believe
that<00:00:50.610> the<00:00:50.850> orange<00:00:51.180> juice<00:00:51.360> we<00:00:51.600> buy<00:00:51.750> from<00:00:51.899> the

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:51.989 
that the orange juice we buy from the

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:54.110 
that the orange juice we buy from the
store<00:00:52.260> contains<00:00:53.160> a<00:00:53.280> high<00:00:53.399> amount<00:00:53.610> of<00:00:53.760> vitamin

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
store contains a high amount of vitamin

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:55.970 
store contains a high amount of vitamin
C<00:00:54.300> but<00:00:54.480> that's<00:00:54.690> actually<00:00:55.140> not<00:00:55.289> true<00:00:55.530> because

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
C but that's actually not true because

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:57.729 
C but that's actually not true because
we<00:00:56.129> see<00:00:56.309> the<00:00:56.430> process<00:00:56.820> of<00:00:56.940> pasteurization

00:00:57.729 --> 00:00:57.739 
we see the process of pasteurization

00:00:57.739 --> 00:01:00.170 
we see the process of pasteurization
destroys<00:00:58.739> most<00:00:59.010> of<00:00:59.190> the<00:00:59.309> vitamin<00:00:59.670> C<00:00:59.879> and<00:01:00.090> the

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180 
destroys most of the vitamin C and the

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:02.240 
destroys most of the vitamin C and the
nutrients<00:01:00.629> in<00:01:00.809> the<00:01:00.899> orange<00:01:01.260> juice<00:01:01.469> not<00:01:02.100> to

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
nutrients in the orange juice not to

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:04.969 
nutrients in the orange juice not to
mention<00:01:02.460> that<00:01:02.969> pasteurization<00:01:03.899> destroys<00:01:04.710> all

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 
mention that pasteurization destroys all

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:07.520 
mention that pasteurization destroys all
of<00:01:05.070> those<00:01:05.189> digestive<00:01:05.880> enzymes<00:01:06.450> that<00:01:07.140> you<00:01:07.290> find

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
of those digestive enzymes that you find

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:09.530 
of those digestive enzymes that you find
in<00:01:07.680> the<00:01:07.740> juice<00:01:07.950> as<00:01:08.159> well<00:01:08.400> and<00:01:08.670> so<00:01:09.150> now<00:01:09.299> I<00:01:09.330> make

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
in the juice as well and so now I make

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:12.440 
in the juice as well and so now I make
my<00:01:09.689> orange<00:01:09.900> juice<00:01:10.049> in<00:01:10.380> my<00:01:10.830> juicer<00:01:11.250> and<00:01:11.520> it's

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
my orange juice in my juicer and it's

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:14.719 
my orange juice in my juicer and it's
much<00:01:12.630> more<00:01:12.810> healthier<00:01:13.229> that<00:01:13.409> way<00:01:13.470> it<00:01:14.310> may<00:01:14.520> be<00:01:14.580> a

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729 
much more healthier that way it may be a

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:16.460 
much more healthier that way it may be a
little<00:01:14.909> more<00:01:15.119> costly<00:01:15.360> but<00:01:15.990> making<00:01:16.320> an

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470 
little more costly but making an

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:18.020 
little more costly but making an
investment<00:01:16.979> in<00:01:17.100> your<00:01:17.220> health<00:01:17.280> today<00:01:17.640> is

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
investment in your health today is

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:20.420 
investment in your health today is
better<00:01:18.540> than<00:01:18.689> paying<00:01:19.439> for<00:01:19.650> being<00:01:20.130> sick

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430 
better than paying for being sick

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:27.130 
better than paying for being sick
tomorrow<00:01:20.970> so<00:01:21.869> let's<00:01:21.990> get<00:01:22.170> to<00:01:22.320> the<00:01:22.409> juicing

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:27.140 

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:29.569 

this<00:01:28.140> is<00:01:28.259> a<00:01:28.290> juicer<00:01:28.680> that<00:01:28.710> I<00:01:28.860> picked<00:01:29.100> up<00:01:29.220> from<00:01:29.430> a

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:29.579 
this is a juicer that I picked up from a

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:31.700 
this is a juicer that I picked up from a
store<00:01:29.759> called<00:01:29.970> Biedronka<00:01:30.420> I<00:01:30.869> live<00:01:31.229> in<00:01:31.350> Poland

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
store called Biedronka I live in Poland

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:33.890 
store called Biedronka I live in Poland
right<00:01:31.740> now<00:01:32.040> and<00:01:32.460> Madoka<00:01:33.119> is<00:01:33.329> a<00:01:33.450> store<00:01:33.720> where

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:33.900 
right now and Madoka is a store where

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:35.600 
right now and Madoka is a store where
you<00:01:33.990> can<00:01:34.140> find<00:01:34.380> a<00:01:34.500> lot<00:01:34.650> of<00:01:34.680> things<00:01:35.009> that<00:01:35.220> are<00:01:35.400> at

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:35.610 
you can find a lot of things that are at

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:37.609 
you can find a lot of things that are at
low<00:01:35.909> cost<00:01:36.270> so<00:01:36.570> it's<00:01:36.720> basically<00:01:37.020> like<00:01:37.229> a<00:01:37.290> low

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:37.619 
low cost so it's basically like a low

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:39.830 
low cost so it's basically like a low
cost<00:01:37.920> or<00:01:38.340> the<00:01:39.000> quality<00:01:39.450> of<00:01:39.570> the<00:01:39.659> merchandise

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 
cost or the quality of the merchandise

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:43.730 
cost or the quality of the merchandise
isn't<00:01:40.500> always<00:01:41.189> the<00:01:41.369> highest<00:01:41.630> quality<00:01:42.740> but

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 
isn't always the highest quality but

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:45.620 
isn't always the highest quality but
this<00:01:44.100> juicer<00:01:44.490> seems<00:01:44.729> to<00:01:44.850> be<00:01:44.939> pretty<00:01:45.210> decent<00:01:45.360> I

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
this juicer seems to be pretty decent I

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:48.020 
this juicer seems to be pretty decent I
think<00:01:45.810> I<00:01:45.899> paid<00:01:46.110> something<00:01:46.530> like<00:01:46.710> 10<00:01:47.640> u.s.

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
think I paid something like 10 u.s.

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:50.480 
think I paid something like 10 u.s.
dollars<00:01:48.509> for<00:01:48.780> it<00:01:48.960> if<00:01:49.140> you<00:01:50.040> were<00:01:50.159> to<00:01:50.189> compare

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:50.490 
dollars for it if you were to compare

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:52.190 
dollars for it if you were to compare
the<00:01:50.640> price<00:01:50.970> that<00:01:51.149> I<00:01:51.210> paid<00:01:51.479> for<00:01:51.689> it<00:01:51.780> in<00:01:51.869> dollars

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:52.200 
the price that I paid for it in dollars

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:56.569 
the price that I paid for it in dollars
so<00:01:52.649> let's<00:01:52.680> get<00:01:52.979> to<00:01:53.070> the<00:01:53.189> juicing<00:01:55.310> I'm<00:01:56.310> going<00:01:56.520> to

00:01:56.569 --> 00:01:56.579 
so let's get to the juicing I'm going to

00:01:56.579 --> 00:01:58.280 
so let's get to the juicing I'm going to
set<00:01:56.790> this<00:01:56.909> to<00:01:56.969> where<00:01:57.240> not<00:01:57.450> a<00:01:57.479> lot<00:01:57.659> of<00:01:57.689> pop<00:01:58.020> comes

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:58.290 
set this to where not a lot of pop comes

00:01:58.290 --> 00:01:59.810 
set this to where not a lot of pop comes
through<00:01:58.469> I<00:01:58.560> don't<00:01:58.829> like<00:01:58.979> my<00:01:59.159> juice<00:01:59.369> with<00:01:59.579> a<00:01:59.610> lot

00:01:59.810 --> 00:01:59.820 
through I don't like my juice with a lot

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:03.020 
through I don't like my juice with a lot
of<00:01:59.850> pulp<00:02:01.219> there<00:02:02.219> will<00:02:02.340> still<00:02:02.490> be<00:02:02.549> a<00:02:02.670> little<00:02:02.820> bit

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:03.030 
of pulp there will still be a little bit

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:20.450 
of pulp there will still be a little bit
of<00:02:03.119> bulb<00:02:03.299> but<00:02:03.509> I<00:02:03.750> like<00:02:04.170> it<00:02:04.320> juicy

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:20.460 

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:22.890 

and<00:02:21.460> this<00:02:21.730> is<00:02:21.850> pretty<00:02:22.030> cool<00:02:22.270> because<00:02:22.420> it<00:02:22.690> spins

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:22.900 
and this is pretty cool because it spins

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:26.250 
and this is pretty cool because it spins
around<00:02:23.080> both<00:02:23.470> ways<00:02:23.770> -<00:02:24.630> you<00:02:25.630> hold<00:02:25.840> it<00:02:25.960> down<00:02:26.050> one

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:26.260 
around both ways - you hold it down one

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:27.930 
around both ways - you hold it down one
time<00:02:26.470> and<00:02:26.680> it<00:02:26.740> spins<00:02:26.950> in<00:02:27.070> one<00:02:27.100> direction<00:02:27.340> and

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:27.940 
time and it spins in one direction and

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:29.370 
time and it spins in one direction and
then<00:02:28.210> when<00:02:28.330> you<00:02:28.420> let<00:02:28.570> it<00:02:28.600> go<00:02:28.690> and<00:02:28.900> hold<00:02:29.110> it<00:02:29.260> down

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:29.380 
then when you let it go and hold it down

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:30.930 
then when you let it go and hold it down
again<00:02:29.680> it<00:02:29.830> spins<00:02:30.370> in<00:02:30.490> the<00:02:30.520> other<00:02:30.730> direction

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:30.940 
again it spins in the other direction

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:40.740 
again it spins in the other direction
and<00:02:31.510> look<00:02:31.960> how<00:02:32.140> well<00:02:32.380> it<00:02:32.590> uses<00:02:32.800> that<00:02:39.630> now<00:02:40.630> I'll

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:40.750 
and look how well it uses that now I'll

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:59.340 
and look how well it uses that now I'll
do<00:02:40.840> the<00:02:40.900> same<00:02:40.990> for<00:02:41.230> my<00:02:41.350> other<00:02:41.470> lunges<00:02:58.230> look<00:02:59.230> at

00:02:59.340 --> 00:02:59.350 
do the same for my other lunges look at

00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:01.230 
do the same for my other lunges look at
how<00:02:59.440> that<00:02:59.500> let<00:02:59.710> me<00:02:59.740> got<00:02:59.950> used<00:03:00.160> my<00:03:00.850> dad<00:03:01.060> was
