 able in your opinion to assume our 

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:43.360
 language to assimilate it and especially the 

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:46.050
 feeling through bridges and half 

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:48.850
 I think their culture has dances and 

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:50.860
 very spiritual sounds and I think it is 

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:53.680
 assimilates much to flamenco in many 

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:56.259
 aspects but she has something special and 

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:58.660

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:17.050
 when you're interested in flamenco because 

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:19.570
 I was very young 

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:22.630
 I like flamenco since I was 20 

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:25.110
 years when I was a student of 

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:25.110
 college 

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:31.320
 university 

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:31.320
 jukka understands very well Spanish 

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:38.310
 well now pretty pretty well and I 

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:42.600
 I want to ask you if it really 

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:42.600
 you understand what you sing 

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:49.140
 good for the real flame 

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:49.140
 and good 

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:57.050
 because it exists for me but every day more 

00:02:52.950 --> 00:03:01.000

00:02:57.050 --> 00:03:01.000
 a d 

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:07.430
 I think we have proven it in the 

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:09.860

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:12.700

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:12.700

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:23.740
 that transmits with energy that what 

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:29.850
 it means singing the most 

00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:29.850
 difficult and impossible to get for me 

00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:36.250
 I think they get it and the best is 

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:38.590
 that we share it, not that energy 

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:40.450
 that transmits is yucca with the teacher I know 

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:43.000
