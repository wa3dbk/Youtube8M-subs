00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:03.740 

so<00:00:00.539> I<00:00:00.570> will<00:00:00.840> say<00:00:01.110> that<00:00:01.469> I<00:00:01.890> did<00:00:02.520> eventually<00:00:02.970> get

00:00:03.740 --> 00:00:03.750 
so I will say that I did eventually get

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:09.440 
so I will say that I did eventually get
this<00:00:03.990> act<00:00:04.410> in<00:00:04.819> the<00:00:06.410> depths<00:00:07.410> crew<00:00:07.770> I<00:00:08.450> really

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:09.450 
this act in the depths crew I really

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:11.390 
this act in the depths crew I really
came<00:00:09.630> out<00:00:09.780> what<00:00:09.960> I<00:00:09.990> wound<00:00:10.320> up<00:00:10.410> doing<00:00:10.469> actually

00:00:11.390 --> 00:00:11.400 
came out what I wound up doing actually

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:14.810 
came out what I wound up doing actually
was<00:00:11.700> when<00:00:12.150> this<00:00:12.300> was<00:00:12.480> on<00:00:12.719> still<00:00:13.429> I'm<00:00:14.429> just<00:00:14.639> sort

00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:14.820 
was when this was on still I'm just sort

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:17.900 
was when this was on still I'm just sort
of<00:00:14.849> very<00:00:15.299> very<00:00:15.690> gently<00:00:16.199> tapping<00:00:16.710> it<00:00:17.100> with<00:00:17.880> a

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:17.910 
of very very gently tapping it with a

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:21.200 
of very very gently tapping it with a
hammer<00:00:18.300> as<00:00:18.660> I<00:00:19.500> had<00:00:19.710> a<00:00:19.740> large<00:00:20.130> screwdriver<00:00:20.670> at

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:21.210 
hammer as I had a large screwdriver at

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:23.720 
hammer as I had a large screwdriver at
this<00:00:21.390> end<00:00:21.630> and<00:00:21.779> twisted<00:00:22.289> it<00:00:22.439> and<00:00:22.650> that<00:00:23.310> got<00:00:23.550> it

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:23.730 
this end and twisted it and that got it

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:25.970 
this end and twisted it and that got it
to<00:00:23.939> break<00:00:24.570> through<00:00:24.990> and<00:00:25.109> feed<00:00:25.410> that's<00:00:25.650> after

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:25.980 
to break through and feed that's after

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:29.029 
to break through and feed that's after
several<00:00:26.340> cycles<00:00:26.849> of<00:00:27.590> cleaning<00:00:28.590> with<00:00:28.800> this

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:29.039 
several cycles of cleaning with this

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:32.179 
several cycles of cleaning with this
citrus<00:00:29.670> a<00:00:30.150> degreaser<00:00:30.599> cleaner<00:00:31.170> and<00:00:31.529> then<00:00:32.160> I

00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:32.189 
citrus a degreaser cleaner and then I

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:35.420 
citrus a degreaser cleaner and then I
used<00:00:32.669> what's<00:00:33.030> in<00:00:33.149> this<00:00:33.350> penetrating<00:00:34.350> oil<00:00:34.500> so

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:35.430 
used what's in this penetrating oil so

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:39.920 
used what's in this penetrating oil so
that<00:00:35.640> got<00:00:35.880> all<00:00:36.750> of<00:00:36.989> this<00:00:37.219> apart<00:00:38.660> with<00:00:39.660> the

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930 
that got all of this apart with the

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:43.700 
that got all of this apart with the
depth<00:00:41.270> setting<00:00:42.270> met<00:00:42.450> micrometer<00:00:42.870> mechanism

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:43.710 
depth setting met micrometer mechanism

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:49.040 
depth setting met micrometer mechanism
there's<00:00:44.300> a<00:00:46.399> little<00:00:47.399> catch<00:00:47.940> clip<00:00:48.719> right<00:00:48.989> here

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.050 
there's a little catch clip right here

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:54.110 
there's a little catch clip right here
and<00:00:49.559> then<00:00:50.430> the<00:00:50.700> screw<00:00:51.449> so<00:00:51.809> this<00:00:51.960> is<00:00:52.140> all<00:00:53.120> taken

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
and then the screw so this is all taken

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:56.180 
and then the screw so this is all taken
apart<00:00:54.420> now<00:00:54.690> it'll<00:00:55.440> need<00:00:55.530> to<00:00:55.590> be<00:00:55.710> cleaned<00:00:56.039> up

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
apart now it'll need to be cleaned up

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:00.650 
apart now it'll need to be cleaned up
really<00:00:56.489> good<00:00:57.170> this<00:00:58.170> is<00:00:59.210> attached<00:01:00.210> to<00:01:00.329> the

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
really good this is attached to the

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:07.250 
really good this is attached to the
quill<00:01:01.250> and<00:01:03.049> that's<00:01:04.049> the<00:01:04.350> stock<00:01:04.650> nut<00:01:05.930> okay<00:01:06.930> and

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260 
quill and that's the stock nut okay and

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:11.870 
quill and that's the stock nut okay and
so<00:01:09.290> I'll<00:01:10.290> probably<00:01:10.500> take<00:01:10.830> that<00:01:11.040> apart<00:01:11.430> as<00:01:11.610> well

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
so I'll probably take that apart as well

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:13.670 
so I'll probably take that apart as well
in<00:01:12.240> the<00:01:12.330> next<00:01:12.540> step<00:01:12.900> I'm<00:01:13.049> not<00:01:13.200> sure<00:01:13.350> if<00:01:13.409> we<00:01:13.500> take

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
in the next step I'm not sure if we take

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:18.830 
in the next step I'm not sure if we take
the<00:01:13.860> spin<00:01:14.220> allowed<00:01:14.460> or<00:01:14.700> not<00:01:15.380> a<00:01:17.509> point<00:01:18.509> over<00:01:18.810> to

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
the spin allowed or not a point over to

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:22.820 
the spin allowed or not a point over to
here<00:01:19.140> this<00:01:19.790> the<00:01:20.790> felt<00:01:21.210> looks<00:01:21.840> like<00:01:22.080> it<00:01:22.290> was<00:01:22.470> out

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
here this the felt looks like it was out

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:26.510 
here this the felt looks like it was out
you<00:01:23.460> have<00:01:23.580> the<00:01:23.700> oiler<00:01:24.150> right<00:01:24.450> here<00:01:25.189> which<00:01:26.189> has

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
you have the oiler right here which has

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:35.660 
you have the oiler right here which has
some<00:01:26.790> gunk<00:01:27.150> in<00:01:27.420> it<00:01:31.340> and<00:01:33.500> probably<00:01:34.549> replacing<00:01:35.549> a

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670 
some gunk in it and probably replacing a

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:41.929 
some gunk in it and probably replacing a
felt<00:01:36.479> in<00:01:36.720> there<00:01:37.460> and<00:01:38.460> then<00:01:40.490> comes<00:01:41.490> down<00:01:41.549> into

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:41.939 
felt in there and then comes down into

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:48.289 
felt in there and then comes down into
here<00:01:43.729> spindle<00:01:45.229> and<00:01:46.460> I'll<00:01:47.460> probably<00:01:47.670> take<00:01:48.060> that

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:48.299 
here spindle and I'll probably take that

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:52.249 
here spindle and I'll probably take that
I'll<00:01:48.600> clean<00:01:48.869> it<00:01:48.920> but<00:01:49.920> I<00:01:49.950> believe<00:01:50.310> there<00:01:50.610> is<00:01:51.259> let

00:01:52.249 --> 00:01:52.259 
I'll clean it but I believe there is let

00:01:52.259 --> 00:02:00.350 
I'll clean it but I believe there is let
me<00:01:52.290> just<00:01:52.350> point<00:01:53.689> down<00:01:54.689> into<00:01:55.079> here<00:01:59.149> right<00:02:00.149> up

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:00.360 
me just point down into here right up

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:04.429 
me just point down into here right up
right<00:02:00.960> here<00:02:01.560> I'm<00:02:01.920> attached<00:02:02.250> to<00:02:02.280> here<00:02:02.990> and<00:02:03.990> then

00:02:04.429 --> 00:02:04.439 
right here I'm attached to here and then

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:06.520 
right here I'm attached to here and then
on<00:02:04.649> the<00:02:04.770> other<00:02:04.799> side

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:06.530 
on the other side

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:09.260 
on the other side
it's

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:09.270 
it's

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:12.660 
it's
this<00:02:10.270> screw<00:02:10.660> right<00:02:10.690> here<00:02:11.460> believe<00:02:12.460> there's

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:12.670 
this screw right here believe there's

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:17.030 
this screw right here believe there's
supposed<00:02:12.880> to<00:02:12.940> be<00:02:13.030> a<00:02:13.090> piece<00:02:13.270> of<00:02:13.480> belt<00:02:13.980> over<00:02:14.980> the

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:17.040 
supposed to be a piece of belt over the

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:23.210 
supposed to be a piece of belt over the
spindle<00:02:20.190> as<00:02:21.190> a<00:02:21.370> like<00:02:22.030> a<00:02:22.060> cover<00:02:22.480> or<00:02:22.600> something

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:23.220 
spindle as a like a cover or something

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:26.640 
spindle as a like a cover or something
so<00:02:24.220> I<00:02:24.250> think<00:02:24.400> that's<00:02:24.790> missing<00:02:25.270> in<00:02:25.420> this<00:02:25.650> the

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:26.650 
so I think that's missing in this the

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:29.550 
so I think that's missing in this the
spindle<00:02:27.070> itself<00:02:27.220> looks<00:02:27.760> like<00:02:27.940> it<00:02:28.200> spins<00:02:29.200> just

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:29.560 
spindle itself looks like it spins just

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:35.910 
spindle itself looks like it spins just
fine<00:02:33.240> and<00:02:34.240> I'm<00:02:34.480> not<00:02:34.510> sure<00:02:34.900> how<00:02:35.200> far<00:02:35.620> I'm<00:02:35.740> going

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:35.920 
fine and I'm not sure how far I'm going

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:37.320 
fine and I'm not sure how far I'm going
to<00:02:35.980> continue<00:02:36.250> disassembling<00:02:37.120> because

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:37.330 
to continue disassembling because

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:40.410 
to continue disassembling because
everything<00:02:37.690> actually<00:02:38.610> otherwise<00:02:39.610> internally

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:40.420 
everything actually otherwise internally

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:44.340 
everything actually otherwise internally
really<00:02:40.840> looks<00:02:41.170> pretty<00:02:42.120> good<00:02:43.120> not<00:02:44.050> a<00:02:44.080> lot<00:02:44.320> of

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:44.350 
really looks pretty good not a lot of

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:46.920 
really looks pretty good not a lot of
wear<00:02:44.680> or<00:02:44.920> anything<00:02:45.360> so<00:02:46.360> I<00:02:46.390> think<00:02:46.480> it<00:02:46.630> just<00:02:46.780> may

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:46.930 
wear or anything so I think it just may

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:49.470 
wear or anything so I think it just may
need<00:02:47.080> some<00:02:47.350> paint<00:02:47.590> cleaning<00:02:48.010> up<00:02:48.280> getting<00:02:48.940> the

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:49.480 
need some paint cleaning up getting the

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:51.180 
need some paint cleaning up getting the
X<00:02:49.900> from<00:02:50.170> the<00:02:50.230> debris<00:02:50.440> out<00:02:50.650> this<00:02:50.860> is<00:02:50.950> from<00:02:51.070> a

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:51.190 
X from the debris out this is from a

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:53.760 
X from the debris out this is from a
plastics<00:02:51.790> factory<00:02:51.880> and<00:02:52.840> unfortunately<00:02:53.740> I

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:53.770 
plastics factory and unfortunately I

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:59.670 
plastics factory and unfortunately I
think<00:02:53.830> a<00:02:54.610> lot<00:02:55.600> of<00:02:56.700> junk<00:02:57.700> just<00:02:58.060> sort<00:02:58.300> of<00:02:58.680> sprayed

00:02:59.670 --> 00:02:59.680 
think a lot of junk just sort of sprayed

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:01.740 
think a lot of junk just sort of sprayed
up<00:02:59.860> and<00:03:00.100> I'm<00:03:00.160> not<00:03:00.190> sure<00:03:00.490> how<00:03:00.730> clean<00:03:01.330> they<00:03:01.480> kept

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:01.750 
up and I'm not sure how clean they kept

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:03.150 
up and I'm not sure how clean they kept
the<00:03:01.870> outside<00:03:02.290> of<00:03:02.500> it<00:03:02.590> but<00:03:02.740> at<00:03:02.800> least<00:03:02.830> looks

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:03.160 
the outside of it but at least looks

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:04.860 
the outside of it but at least looks
like<00:03:03.310> the<00:03:03.430> inside<00:03:03.630> probably<00:03:04.630> has<00:03:04.720> been

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:04.870 
like the inside probably has been

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:09.600 
like the inside probably has been
rebuilt<00:03:05.560> at<00:03:05.740> least<00:03:05.920> once<00:03:06.750> maybe<00:03:07.750> more<00:03:08.370> and<00:03:09.370> so

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:09.610 
rebuilt at least once maybe more and so

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:11.340 
rebuilt at least once maybe more and so
this<00:03:09.760> aerial<00:03:10.180> I'll<00:03:10.330> have<00:03:10.660> to<00:03:10.780> be<00:03:10.900> totally

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:11.350 
this aerial I'll have to be totally

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:18.120 
this aerial I'll have to be totally
cleaned<00:03:11.680> here<00:03:11.980> as<00:03:12.190> well<00:03:16.650> there's<00:03:17.650> this<00:03:17.769> junk

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:18.130 
cleaned here as well there's this junk

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:22.470 
cleaned here as well there's this junk
and<00:03:18.280> there<00:03:18.459> it'll<00:03:18.610> make<00:03:18.760> the<00:03:21.269> feed<00:03:22.269> mechanism

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:22.480 
and there it'll make the feed mechanism

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:24.390 
and there it'll make the feed mechanism
move<00:03:22.959> smoothly<00:03:23.290> and<00:03:23.590> then<00:03:23.680> this<00:03:23.830> I<00:03:24.040> want<00:03:24.160> to<00:03:24.250> I

do want to take this apart you have to

figure out how to get that bearing out

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:30.810 
figure out how to get that bearing out

of there again dental pick may be the

00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:34.620 
of there again dental pick may be the
