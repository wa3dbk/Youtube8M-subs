00:00:36.799 --> 00:00:36.809 
I think the biggest thing I remember was

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:40.310

the<00:00:37.170> quality<00:00:37.680> of<00:00:37.710> team<00:00:38.640> that<00:00:38.670> Belgium<00:00:39.210> is<00:00:39.390> you

00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:32.360 
of guys who have been there before their

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:33.490 
of guys who have been there before their
experience<00:04:32.840> will<00:04:32.930> show<00:04:33.080> through<00:04:33.290> their

00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:33.500 
experience will show through their

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:34.660 
experience will show through their
leadership<00:04:33.740> will<00:04:34.010> show<00:04:34.160> through<00:04:34.370> and

00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:34.670 
leadership will show through and

00:04:34.670 --> 00:04:36.010 
leadership will show through and
hopefully<00:04:35.120> that'll<00:04:35.420> be<00:04:35.510> enough<00:04:35.570> to<00:04:35.810> get<00:04:35.900> the

00:04:36.010 --> 00:04:36.020 
hopefully that'll be enough to get the

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:38.380 
hopefully that'll be enough to get the
job<00:04:36.050> done<00:04:36.200> and<00:04:37.010> aside<00:04:37.880> from<00:04:37.910> the<00:04:38.180> players

00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:38.390 
job done and aside from the players

00:04:38.390 --> 00:04:40.540 
job done and aside from the players
obviously<00:04:38.840> the<00:04:39.440> Kaku<00:04:39.830> hazard<00:04:40.220> that<00:04:40.250> kind<00:04:40.520> of

00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:40.550 
obviously the Kaku hazard that kind of

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:41.560 
obviously the Kaku hazard that kind of
thing<00:04:40.700> is<00:04:40.820> there<00:04:40.940> anything<00:04:41.150> else<00:04:41.390> you<00:04:41.540> can

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:41.570 
thing is there anything else you can

00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:43.210 
thing is there anything else you can
take<00:04:41.930> from<00:04:42.080> that<00:04:42.260> friendly<00:04:42.650> as<00:04:42.740> a<00:04:42.770> good<00:04:43.100> that

00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:43.220 
take from that friendly as a good that

00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:44.740 
take from that friendly as a good that
they<00:04:43.340> had<00:04:43.550> that<00:04:43.730> friendly<00:04:44.060> in<00:04:44.180> Cleveland<00:04:44.480> ya

00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:44.750 
they had that friendly in Cleveland ya

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:46.810 
they had that friendly in Cleveland ya
think<00:04:44.990> so<00:04:45.080> i<00:04:45.200> think<00:04:45.290> obviously<00:04:45.620> set<00:04:46.610> pieces

00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:46.820 
think so i think obviously set pieces

00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:48.240 
think so i think obviously set pieces
will<00:04:47.120> play<00:04:47.300> a<00:04:47.330> big<00:04:47.390> part<00:04:47.570> in<00:04:47.840> this<00:04:47.960> game

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:48.250 
will play a big part in this game

00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:51.250 
will play a big part in this game
especially<00:04:49.250> for<00:04:49.400> the<00:04:49.520> US<00:04:49.820> and<00:04:50.060> you<00:04:50.900> know<00:04:51.020> to<00:04:51.080> go

00:04:51.250 --> 00:04:51.260 
especially for the US and you know to go

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:53.080 
especially for the US and you know to go
back<00:04:51.440> to<00:04:51.590> an<00:04:51.680> earlier<00:04:51.950> point<00:04:52.190> i<00:04:52.370> think<00:04:52.640> you

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:53.090 
back to an earlier point i think you

00:04:53.090 --> 00:04:54.580 
back to an earlier point i think you
know<00:04:53.120> maybe<00:04:53.420> they<00:04:53.600> do<00:04:53.660> have<00:04:53.990> better<00:04:54.260> players

00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:54.590 
know maybe they do have better players

00:04:54.590 --> 00:04:57.790 
know maybe they do have better players
on<00:04:54.920> the<00:04:55.010> field<00:04:55.780> individually<00:04:56.780> but<00:04:57.050> that<00:04:57.650> only

00:04:57.790 --> 00:04:57.800 
on the field individually but that only

00:04:57.800 --> 00:04:59.350 
on the field individually but that only
gives<00:04:58.040> me<00:04:58.340> more<00:04:58.550> confidence<00:04:58.730> in<00:04:59.120> the<00:04:59.240> guy

00:04:59.350 --> 00:04:59.360 
gives me more confidence in the guy

00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:01.060 
gives me more confidence in the guy
playing<00:04:59.780> next<00:05:00.080> to<00:05:00.200> me<00:05:00.350> that<00:05:00.530> all<00:05:00.560> right<00:05:00.830> we've

00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:01.070 
playing next to me that all right we've

00:05:01.070 --> 00:05:03.400 
playing next to me that all right we've
got<00:05:01.220> to<00:05:01.310> step<00:05:01.460> up<00:05:01.520> our<00:05:01.760> game<00:05:01.790> then<00:05:02.180> and<00:05:02.390> I<00:05:03.170> don't

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:03.410 
got to step up our game then and I don't

00:05:03.410 --> 00:05:04.690 
got to step up our game then and I don't
think<00:05:03.620> that<00:05:03.740> most<00:05:03.860> these<00:05:04.070> Belgium<00:05:04.370> guys<00:05:04.520> has

00:05:04.690 --> 00:05:04.700 
think that most these Belgium guys has

00:05:04.700 --> 00:05:06.700 
think that most these Belgium guys has
seen<00:05:04.940> you<00:05:05.480> know<00:05:05.600> a<00:05:05.630> lot<00:05:06.020> of<00:05:06.050> these<00:05:06.200> Americans

00:05:06.700 --> 00:05:06.710 
seen you know a lot of these Americans

00:05:06.710 --> 00:05:08.470 
seen you know a lot of these Americans
play<00:05:06.890> or<00:05:07.040> played<00:05:07.220> against<00:05:07.490> them<00:05:07.670> so<00:05:07.700> maybe<00:05:08.330> in

00:05:08.470 --> 00:05:08.480 
play or played against them so maybe in

00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:09.700 
play or played against them so maybe in
your<00:05:08.540> head<00:05:08.780> you<00:05:08.900> think<00:05:09.110> this<00:05:09.230> is<00:05:09.350> going<00:05:09.470> to<00:05:09.530> be

00:05:09.700 --> 00:05:09.710 
your head you think this is going to be

00:05:09.710 --> 00:05:12.040 
your head you think this is going to be
an<00:05:10.250> easier<00:05:10.700> game<00:05:11.000> but<00:05:11.570> I<00:05:11.600> think<00:05:11.810> that<00:05:11.840> they're

00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:12.050 
an easier game but I think that they're

00:05:12.050 --> 00:05:14.110 
an easier game but I think that they're
in<00:05:12.170> for<00:05:12.350> a<00:05:12.410> surprise<00:05:12.470> and<00:05:13.130> you<00:05:13.370> know<00:05:13.790> anytime

00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:14.120 
in for a surprise and you know anytime

00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:15.880 
in for a surprise and you know anytime
we're<00:05:14.420> backed<00:05:14.870> up<00:05:15.050> against<00:05:15.350> the<00:05:15.410> wall<00:05:15.620> it's

00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:15.890 
we're backed up against the wall it's

00:05:15.890 --> 00:05:17.830 
we're backed up against the wall it's
you<00:05:16.460> know<00:05:16.580> we're<00:05:17.000> bare-knuckle<00:05:17.510> we're<00:05:17.630> going

00:05:17.830 --> 00:05:17.840 
you know we're bare-knuckle we're going

00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:20.980 
you know we're bare-knuckle we're going
after<00:05:17.990> it<00:05:18.260> so<00:05:19.270> there<00:05:20.270> are<00:05:20.420> things<00:05:20.690> you<00:05:20.780> take

00:05:20.980 --> 00:05:20.990 
after it so there are things you take

00:05:20.990 --> 00:05:24.780 
after it so there are things you take
from<00:05:21.140> that<00:05:21.320> game<00:05:21.590> like<00:05:22.160> I<00:05:22.280> said<00:05:22.340> set-pieces

00:05:24.780 --> 00:05:24.790 
from that game like I said set-pieces

00:05:24.790 --> 00:05:27.130 
from that game like I said set-pieces
there's<00:05:25.790> just<00:05:25.970> so<00:05:26.090> fast<00:05:26.420> and<00:05:26.750> they're

00:05:27.130 --> 00:05:27.140 
there's just so fast and they're

00:05:27.140 --> 00:05:29.560 
there's just so fast and they're
attacking<00:05:27.440> and<00:05:27.770> they<00:05:27.890> really<00:05:28.310> tore<00:05:28.580> it<00:05:29.120> yeah

00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:29.570 
attacking and they really tore it yeah

00:05:29.570 --> 00:05:31.210 
attacking and they really tore it yeah
possession<00:05:30.530> possession<00:05:30.740> of<00:05:31.130> the<00:05:31.190> ball

00:05:31.210 --> 00:05:31.220 
possession possession of the ball

00:05:31.220 --> 00:05:33.040 
possession possession of the ball
keeping<00:05:32.000> possession<00:05:32.180> in<00:05:32.510> the<00:05:32.600> attacking<00:05:32.900> half

00:05:33.040 --> 00:05:33.050 
keeping possession in the attacking half

00:05:33.050 --> 00:05:34.420 
keeping possession in the attacking half
which<00:05:33.380> I<00:05:33.590> don't<00:05:33.650> think<00:05:33.800> is<00:05:33.980> something<00:05:34.310> that

00:05:34.420 --> 00:05:34.430 
which I don't think is something that

00:05:34.430 --> 00:05:36.790 
which I don't think is something that
the<00:05:34.850> US<00:05:35.120> has<00:05:35.150> done<00:05:35.510> a<00:05:35.660> good<00:05:35.870> enough<00:05:35.990> job<00:05:36.140> of<00:05:36.530> yet

00:05:36.790 --> 00:05:36.800 
the US has done a good enough job of yet

00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:38.440 
the US has done a good enough job of yet
and<00:05:37.040> I<00:05:37.430> think<00:05:37.640> that<00:05:37.730> that<00:05:37.760> will<00:05:37.940> continue<00:05:38.000> to

00:05:38.440 --> 00:05:38.450 
and I think that that will continue to

00:05:38.450 --> 00:05:39.700 
and I think that that will continue to
get<00:05:38.540> better<00:05:38.690> something<00:05:38.990> they<00:05:39.170> can<00:05:39.350> work<00:05:39.500> on

00:05:39.700 --> 00:05:39.710 
get better something they can work on

00:05:39.710 --> 00:05:41.350 
get better something they can work on
any<00:05:40.280> time<00:05:40.520> you<00:05:40.610> keep<00:05:40.790> possession<00:05:40.970> in<00:05:41.300> the

00:05:41.350 --> 00:05:41.360 
any time you keep possession in the

00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:42.850 
any time you keep possession in the
attacking<00:05:41.630> half<00:05:41.780> you<00:05:42.380> know<00:05:42.470> you<00:05:42.560> wear<00:05:42.710> down

00:05:42.850 --> 00:05:42.860 
attacking half you know you wear down

00:05:42.860 --> 00:05:45.730 
attacking half you know you wear down
the<00:05:43.010> other<00:05:43.160> team's<00:05:43.400> defense<00:05:43.850> and<00:05:44.410> if<00:05:45.410> you<00:05:45.590> can

00:05:45.730 --> 00:05:45.740 
the other team's defense and if you can

00:05:45.740 --> 00:05:47.350 
the other team's defense and if you can
get<00:05:45.890> them<00:05:46.040> out<00:05:46.190> of<00:05:46.340> sorts<00:05:46.580> i<00:05:46.790> think<00:05:47.030> that<00:05:47.210> that

00:05:47.350 --> 00:05:47.360 
get them out of sorts i think that that

00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:49.240 
get them out of sorts i think that that
are<00:05:47.630> that<00:05:47.840> our<00:05:47.990> attacking<00:05:48.260> guys<00:05:48.560> can<00:05:48.800> can<00:05:49.070> turn

00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:49.250 
are that our attacking guys can can turn

00:05:49.250 --> 00:05:50.680 
are that our attacking guys can can turn
some<00:05:49.400> heads<00:05:49.430> well<00:05:50.210> they've<00:05:50.330> got<00:05:50.360> some

00:05:50.680 --> 00:05:50.690 
some heads well they've got some

00:05:50.690 --> 00:05:52.030 
some heads well they've got some
injuries<00:05:51.110> and<00:05:51.320> particularly<00:05:51.650> injuries<00:05:51.890> in

00:05:52.030 --> 00:05:52.040 
injuries and particularly injuries in

00:05:52.040 --> 00:05:53.590 
injuries and particularly injuries in
the<00:05:52.130> back<00:05:52.340> so<00:05:52.610> i<00:05:52.640> agree<00:05:53.210> with<00:05:53.240> you<00:05:53.390> and<00:05:53.510> I<00:05:53.570> think

00:05:53.590 --> 00:05:53.600 
the back so i agree with you and I think

00:05:53.600 --> 00:05:55.240 
the back so i agree with you and I think
that<00:05:53.930> maybe<00:05:54.500> it's<00:05:54.740> a<00:05:54.800> little<00:05:55.010> bit<00:05:55.100> of<00:05:55.130> a

00:05:55.240 --> 00:05:55.250 
that maybe it's a little bit of a
