consistent
see<00:02:13.709> in<00:02:13.860> the<00:02:13.920> paint<00:02:14.159> so<00:02:14.400> we<00:02:14.549> can<00:02:14.730> use<00:02:15.269> it<00:02:15.299> to

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:15.480 
see in the paint so we can use it to

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:17.690 
see in the paint so we can use it to
roll<00:02:15.810> so<00:02:16.260> the<00:02:16.379> directions<00:02:17.010> called<00:02:17.280> for<00:02:17.489> quite

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:17.700 
roll so the directions called for quite

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:22.039 
roll so the directions called for quite
a<00:02:17.730> bit<00:02:18.720> of<00:02:18.870> volume<00:02:19.140> of<00:02:19.409> this<00:02:19.590> product<00:02:20.930> for<00:02:21.930> it

00:02:22.039 --> 00:02:22.049 
a bit of volume of this product for it

00:02:22.049 --> 00:02:23.720 
a bit of volume of this product for it
to<00:02:22.200> work<00:02:22.409> but<00:02:22.709> we're<00:02:22.950> just<00:02:22.980> going<00:02:23.280> to<00:02:23.370> put<00:02:23.519> in<00:02:23.640> a

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:23.730 
to work but we're just going to put in a

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:31.580 
to work but we're just going to put in a
couple<00:02:24.030> of<00:02:24.090> caps<00:02:24.360> full<00:02:26.209> so<00:02:30.170> I'll<00:02:31.170> just<00:02:31.379> go

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:31.590 
couple of caps full so I'll just go

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:33.649 
couple of caps full so I'll just go
ahead<00:02:31.739> and<00:02:31.980> do<00:02:32.099> that<00:02:32.280> you<00:02:32.459> can<00:02:32.610> see<00:02:32.790> that<00:02:33.000> it's

00:02:33.649 --> 00:02:33.659 
ahead and do that you can see that it's

00:02:33.659 --> 00:02:44.240 
ahead and do that you can see that it's
just<00:02:33.780> a<00:02:35.030> latex<00:02:37.129> based<00:02:38.129> liquid<00:02:42.680> it's<00:02:43.680> basically

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:44.250 
just a latex based liquid it's basically

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:49.940 
just a latex based liquid it's basically
like<00:02:44.579> a<00:02:44.640> latex<00:02:45.150> paint<00:02:45.540> without<00:02:45.780> any<00:02:48.950> vehicle

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:49.950 
like a latex paint without any vehicle

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:53.690 
like a latex paint without any vehicle
or<00:02:50.160> tint<00:02:51.120> in<00:02:51.299> it<00:02:52.250> because<00:02:53.250> it's<00:02:53.430> a<00:02:53.519> pretty

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:53.700 
or tint in it because it's a pretty

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:55.580 
or tint in it because it's a pretty
shallow<00:02:54.060> cap<00:02:54.510> I<00:02:54.720> think<00:02:54.959> I'm<00:02:55.079> going<00:02:55.230> to<00:02:55.319> give<00:02:55.440> it

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:55.590 
shallow cap I think I'm going to give it

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:57.860 
shallow cap I think I'm going to give it
whoops<00:02:56.220> I<00:02:56.609> think<00:02:57.090> I'm<00:02:57.209> just<00:02:57.329> going<00:02:57.540> to<00:02:57.569> give<00:02:57.750> it

00:02:57.860 --> 00:02:57.870 
whoops I think I'm just going to give it

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:03.020 
whoops I think I'm just going to give it
the<00:02:57.900> three<00:02:58.819> three<00:02:59.819> caps<00:03:00.120> full<00:03:01.549> give<00:03:02.549> it<00:03:02.670> a<00:03:02.730> stir

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:03.030 
the three three caps full give it a stir

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:07.580 
the three three caps full give it a stir
and<00:03:03.359> see<00:03:04.640> how<00:03:05.640> it<00:03:05.790> works<00:03:06.030> for<00:03:06.329> us<00:03:06.390> should<00:03:07.349> take

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:07.590 
and see how it works for us should take

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:18.819 
and see how it works for us should take
long

00:03:18.819 --> 00:03:18.829 

00:03:18.829 --> 00:03:26.660 

so<00:03:19.829> there<00:03:20.040> you<00:03:20.189> can<00:03:20.249> see<00:03:24.469> the<00:03:25.469> thick<00:03:25.709> stuff<00:03:26.040> on

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:26.670 
so there you can see the thick stuff on

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:28.129 
so there you can see the thick stuff on
the<00:03:26.849> bottom<00:03:27.180> there<00:03:27.359> on<00:03:27.540> the<00:03:27.629> bottom<00:03:27.900> of<00:03:28.019> the

00:03:28.129 --> 00:03:28.139 
the bottom there on the bottom of the

00:03:28.139 --> 00:03:32.500 
the bottom there on the bottom of the
stick<00:03:28.379> there<00:03:28.980> for<00:03:29.249> the<00:03:29.400> bottom<00:03:29.549> of<00:03:29.760> the<00:03:29.909> can<00:03:30.980> is

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:32.510 
stick there for the bottom of the can is

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:37.069 
stick there for the bottom of the can is
breaking<00:03:33.510> down<00:03:34.969> and<00:03:35.969> see<00:03:36.209> the<00:03:36.420> paint's

00:03:37.069 --> 00:03:37.079 
breaking down and see the paint's

00:03:37.079 --> 00:03:39.020 
breaking down and see the paint's
flowing<00:03:37.469> quite<00:03:37.709> nicely<00:03:37.980> so<00:03:38.430> that<00:03:38.639> should<00:03:38.849> do

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:39.030 
flowing quite nicely so that should do

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:47.839 
flowing quite nicely so that should do
us<00:03:44.659> if<00:03:45.659> you<00:03:45.810> find<00:03:46.079> that<00:03:46.169> there's<00:03:46.469> still<00:03:46.849> quite

00:03:47.839 --> 00:03:47.849 
us if you find that there's still quite

00:03:47.849 --> 00:03:50.659 
us if you find that there's still quite
a<00:03:47.909> bit<00:03:48.000> of<00:03:48.650> solids<00:03:49.650> on<00:03:49.799> the<00:03:49.889> bottom<00:03:50.189> after<00:03:50.519> that

00:03:50.659 --> 00:03:50.669 
a bit of solids on the bottom after that

00:03:50.669 --> 00:03:56.240 
a bit of solids on the bottom after that
you<00:03:50.849> can<00:03:51.000> always<00:03:51.980> screw<00:03:52.980> them<00:03:53.189> up<00:03:53.310> edit<00:03:55.250> add

00:03:56.240 --> 00:03:56.250 
you can always screw them up edit add

00:03:56.250 --> 00:04:02.750 
you can always screw them up edit add
another<00:03:56.609> cap<00:03:56.909> full<00:04:00.859> add<00:04:01.859> another<00:04:02.129> cap<00:04:02.459> because

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:02.760 
another cap full add another cap because

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:04.459 
another cap full add another cap because
it<00:04:02.879> doesn't<00:04:03.180> seem<00:04:03.359> to<00:04:03.449> be<00:04:03.569> flowing<00:04:03.810> too<00:04:04.230> well

00:04:04.459 --> 00:04:04.469 
it doesn't seem to be flowing too well

00:04:04.469 --> 00:04:12.409 
it doesn't seem to be flowing too well
right<00:04:05.449> now<00:04:06.449> let's<00:04:10.639> manage<00:04:11.639> to<00:04:11.909> err<00:04:12.150> on<00:04:12.180> the

00:04:12.409 --> 00:04:12.419 
right now let's manage to err on the

00:04:12.419 --> 00:04:22.120 
right now let's manage to err on the
side<00:04:12.750> of<00:04:12.810> caution

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:22.130 

00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:24.670 

so<00:04:22.760> you<00:04:23.030> don't<00:04:23.210> want<00:04:23.360> to<00:04:23.420> get<00:04:23.600> into<00:04:23.990> Ronnie<00:04:24.320> too

00:04:24.670 --> 00:04:24.680 
so you don't want to get into Ronnie too

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:28.200 
so you don't want to get into Ronnie too
sloppy

00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:28.210 

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:36.520 

give<00:04:29.210> it<00:04:29.300> another<00:04:29.570> 30<00:04:29.960> seconds<00:04:30.560> start<00:04:35.350> you<00:04:36.350> can

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:36.530 
give it another 30 seconds start you can

00:04:36.530 --> 00:04:38.020 
give it another 30 seconds start you can
really<00:04:36.830> feel<00:04:37.100> the<00:04:37.280> difference<00:04:37.310> in<00:04:37.910> the

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:38.030 
really feel the difference in the

00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:49.780 
really feel the difference in the
stirring<00:04:38.660> action<00:04:48.100> you<00:04:49.100> can<00:04:49.220> see<00:04:49.430> how<00:04:49.640> that's

00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:49.790 
stirring action you can see how that's

00:04:49.790 --> 00:04:53.740 
stirring action you can see how that's
really<00:04:50.210> running<00:04:50.450> off<00:04:50.720> there<00:04:50.960> now<00:04:52.750> quite

00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:53.750 
really running off there now quite

00:04:53.750 --> 00:04:56.320 
really running off there now quite
nicely<00:04:54.220> there's<00:04:55.220> no<00:04:55.340> more<00:04:55.610> solids<00:04:56.120> at<00:04:56.240> the

00:04:56.320 --> 00:04:56.330 
nicely there's no more solids at the

00:04:56.330 --> 00:05:02.290 
nicely there's no more solids at the
bottom<00:04:56.630> at<00:04:56.750> stick<00:04:58.270> so<00:04:59.270> mission<00:04:59.720> accomplished
