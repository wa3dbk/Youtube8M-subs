that and it's not that it brought back
quick<00:00:38.790> scoping<00:00:39.120> because<00:00:39.450> that's<00:00:39.750> really<00:00:39.960> not

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170 
quick scoping because that's really not

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:42.080 
quick scoping because that's really not
what<00:00:40.230> they<00:00:40.410> were<00:00:40.469> trying<00:00:40.649> to<00:00:40.800> do<00:00:40.920> it<00:00:41.129> brought

true<00:00:43.250> sniping<00:00:44.250> to<00:00:44.850> black<00:00:45.059> ops<00:00:45.329> and<00:00:45.780> that's

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020 
true sniping to black ops and that's

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:47.900 
true sniping to black ops and that's
what<00:00:46.170> it<00:00:46.260> is<00:00:46.379> you<00:00:46.559> can't<00:00:46.770> compare<00:00:47.160> the<00:00:47.430> sniping

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:47.910 
what it is you can't compare the sniping

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:50.240 
what it is you can't compare the sniping
in<00:00:48.030> black<00:00:48.210> ops<00:00:48.420> 2<00:00:48.510> anything<00:00:48.899> else<00:00:49.079> and<00:00:49.260> look<00:00:50.129> at

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 
in black ops 2 anything else and look at

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:53.060 
in black ops 2 anything else and look at
that<00:00:50.600> double<00:00:51.600> second<00:00:52.289> chance<00:00:52.500> the<00:00:52.739> guy<00:00:52.860> that<00:00:53.010> I

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070 
that double second chance the guy that I

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:54.799 
that double second chance the guy that I
put<00:00:53.340> in<00:00:53.460> second<00:00:53.730> chance<00:00:53.879> first<00:00:54.149> kills<00:00:54.510> the<00:00:54.690> guy

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
put in second chance first kills the guy

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:56.990 
put in second chance first kills the guy
that<00:00:54.989> I<00:00:55.050> put<00:00:55.260> a<00:00:55.289> second<00:00:55.620> chance<00:00:55.800> second<00:00:56.219> what

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000 
that I put a second chance second what

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:58.700 
that I put a second chance second what
are<00:00:57.090> the<00:00:57.149> odds<00:00:57.270> from<00:00:57.780> a<00:00:57.899> helicopter<00:00:58.079> but

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
are the odds from a helicopter but

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:03.529 
are the odds from a helicopter but
anyway<00:00:59.539> back<00:01:00.539> to<00:01:00.690> what<00:01:00.750> I<00:01:00.840> was<00:01:00.899> saying<00:01:01.020> I<00:01:02.539> don't

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539 
anyway back to what I was saying I don't

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:04.820 
anyway back to what I was saying I don't
want<00:01:03.809> it<00:01:03.870> to<00:01:03.930> be<00:01:04.049> compared<00:01:04.379> to<00:01:04.439> anymore

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
want it to be compared to anymore

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:07.100 
want it to be compared to anymore
because<00:01:05.040> the<00:01:05.970> black<00:01:06.210> ops<00:01:06.450> nothing<00:01:06.840> is<00:01:06.960> so

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
because the black ops nothing is so

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:08.719 
because the black ops nothing is so
unique<00:01:07.500> in<00:01:07.650> the<00:01:07.740> way<00:01:07.830> that<00:01:07.979> they<00:01:08.040> created<00:01:08.520> it

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
unique in the way that they created it

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:11.170 
unique in the way that they created it
that<00:01:09.510> it's<00:01:09.960> really<00:01:10.200> not<00:01:10.409> comparable

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:11.180 
that it's really not comparable

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:15.050 
that it's really not comparable
comparable<00:01:12.180> to<00:01:12.420> modern<00:01:12.720> warfare<00:01:12.960> 2<00:01:13.439> and<00:01:14.060> call

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
comparable to modern warfare 2 and call

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:17.240 
comparable to modern warfare 2 and call
of<00:01:15.150> duty<00:01:15.330> 4<00:01:15.570> call<00:01:16.140> of<00:01:16.229> duty<00:01:16.290> 4<00:01:16.470> was<00:01:16.799> amazing

sniper gameplay and sniper abilities and
that's<00:01:20.100> where<00:01:20.310> it<00:01:20.369> should<00:01:20.400> stay<00:01:20.729> in<00:01:21.000> call<00:01:21.270> of

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:21.299 
that's where it should stay in call of

you<00:01:34.320> to<00:01:34.409> the<00:01:34.829> Triarch<00:01:35.250> team<00:01:35.520> that<00:01:36.180> have<00:01:36.329> been

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479 
you to the Triarch team that have been

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:38.990 
you to the Triarch team that have been
working<00:01:36.930> on<00:01:37.110> the<00:01:37.439> sniping<00:01:37.909> calibration<00:01:38.909> I

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:39.000 
working on the sniping calibration I

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:40.609 
working on the sniping calibration I
guess<00:01:39.180> you<00:01:39.299> could<00:01:39.329> say<00:01:39.659> to<00:01:40.170> get<00:01:40.350> it<00:01:40.470> to<00:01:40.590> a

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:40.619 
guess you could say to get it to a

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:43.850 
guess you could say to get it to a
balanced<00:01:41.070> level<00:01:41.430> where<00:01:41.579> we<00:01:41.610> can<00:01:42.680> go<00:01:43.680> up

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860 
balanced level where we can go up

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:45.710 
balanced level where we can go up
against<00:01:44.310> assault<00:01:44.759> rifles<00:01:45.119> and<00:01:45.329> still<00:01:45.540> hold

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:48.119 
our own and a semi aggressive pace and

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:50.179 
our own and a semi aggressive pace and
not<00:01:48.659> be<00:01:48.840> like<00:01:48.960> this<00:01:49.140> guy<00:01:49.259> coming<00:01:49.770> up<00:01:49.890> right

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:50.189 
not be like this guy coming up right

of<00:01:52.920> the<00:01:53.009> map<00:01:53.250> and<00:01:53.520> then<00:01:54.030> just<00:01:54.270> waits<00:01:54.509> for

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:54.659 
of the map and then just waits for
