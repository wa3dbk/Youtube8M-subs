lifting weights is very important as far
as<00:00:39.899> building<00:00:40.110> muscle<00:00:40.710> to<00:00:41.280> make<00:00:41.790> your<00:00:41.940> your

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:42.360 
as building muscle to make your your

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:45.139 
as building muscle to make your your
muscles<00:00:42.960> fail<00:00:43.200> and<00:00:43.579> if<00:00:44.579> you<00:00:44.700> don't<00:00:44.879> make<00:00:45.000> your

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
muscles fail you cannot increase muscle

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:52.069 
muscles fail you cannot increase muscle
mass<00:00:49.500> and<00:00:49.890> here's<00:00:50.850> what<00:00:50.940> happens<00:00:51.390> inside<00:00:51.840> you

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
mass and here's what happens inside you

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:53.900 
mass and here's what happens inside you
inside<00:00:52.260> your<00:00:52.590> muscles<00:00:52.920> when<00:00:53.399> you<00:00:53.489> lift<00:00:53.699> and

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
you lift the weight ok heavyweight you

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:58.209 
you lift the weight ok heavyweight you
fail<00:00:56.579> between<00:00:57.120> four<00:00:57.510> and<00:00:57.539> eight<00:00:57.719> repetitions

fail between four and eight repetitions

00:00:58.219 --> 00:01:02.000 
fail between four and eight repetitions
here's<00:00:59.219> what<00:00:59.399> happens<00:00:59.760> a<00:00:59.910> deep<00:01:00.750> cut<00:01:01.199> goes<00:01:01.829> into

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
here's what happens a deep cut goes into

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:05.539 
here's what happens a deep cut goes into
your<00:01:02.070> muscle<00:01:02.489> feet<00:01:02.940> deep<00:01:03.809> tears<00:01:04.260> deep<00:01:05.010> cuts<00:01:05.369> on

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549 
your muscle feet deep tears deep cuts on

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:09.500 
your muscle feet deep tears deep cuts on
your<00:01:05.580> muscle<00:01:06.090> fibers<00:01:07.080> and<00:01:07.909> what<00:01:08.909> happens<00:01:09.330> is

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:09.510 
your muscle fibers and what happens is

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:12.770 
your muscle fibers and what happens is
your<00:01:10.140> body<00:01:10.439> goes<00:01:10.770> I<00:01:11.010> never<00:01:11.850> want<00:01:12.420> to<00:01:12.479> fail

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
your body goes I never want to fail

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:15.020 
your body goes I never want to fail
again<00:01:12.960> your<00:01:13.380> body<00:01:13.950> never<00:01:14.280> wants<00:01:14.549> to<00:01:14.610> fail<00:01:14.850> you

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
again your body never wants to fail you

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:17.780 
again your body never wants to fail you
so<00:01:15.299> what<00:01:15.960> happens<00:01:16.320> is<00:01:16.500> your<00:01:17.280> muscle<00:01:17.700> gets

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790 
so what happens is your muscle gets

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:20.149 
so what happens is your muscle gets
repaired<00:01:18.240> and<00:01:18.509> then<00:01:18.990> next<00:01:19.560> time<00:01:19.830> you<00:01:19.979> go<00:01:20.100> to

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
repaired and then next time you go to

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:22.280 
repaired and then next time you go to
lift<00:01:20.369> that<00:01:20.490> weight<00:01:20.729> your<00:01:21.509> body<00:01:21.540> wants<00:01:22.140> to

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:22.290 
lift that weight your body wants to

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:25.039 
lift that weight your body wants to
respond<00:01:22.770> and<00:01:23.040> wants<00:01:23.610> to<00:01:23.640> go<00:01:24.570> ahead<00:01:24.659> and<00:01:24.840> pick

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:09.830 
beta exosphere own does is it actually
increases<00:02:06.390> the<00:02:08.000> synthesis<00:02:09.000> of<00:02:09.179> proteins<00:02:09.360> and

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:09.840 
increases the synthesis of proteins and

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:12.559 
increases the synthesis of proteins and
proteins<00:02:10.739> we<00:02:10.950> all<00:02:11.069> know<00:02:11.340> is<00:02:11.550> or<00:02:11.760> what<00:02:12.090> the

00:02:12.559 --> 00:02:12.569 
proteins we all know is or what the

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:13.760 
proteins we all know is or what the
building<00:02:13.020> blocks

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:13.770 
building blocks

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:16.880 
building blocks
of<00:02:13.890> muscle<00:02:14.730> so<00:02:15.270> what<00:02:16.200> we're<00:02:16.320> doing<00:02:16.650> with<00:02:16.770> this

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:16.890 
of muscle so what we're doing with this

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:20.060 
of muscle so what we're doing with this
product<00:02:17.340> is<00:02:17.430> where<00:02:17.580> we'll<00:02:18.030> give<00:02:18.930> our<00:02:19.170> self<00:02:19.950> a

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:20.070 
product is where we'll give our self a

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:22.400 
product is where we'll give our self a
chance<00:02:20.370> to<00:02:20.750> increase<00:02:21.750> the<00:02:21.960> amount<00:02:22.170> of<00:02:22.260> weight

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:22.410 
chance to increase the amount of weight

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:23.810 
chance to increase the amount of weight
that<00:02:22.440> we're<00:02:22.650> lifting<00:02:22.800> to<00:02:23.190> give<00:02:23.340> us<00:02:23.460> deeper

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:23.820 
that we're lifting to give us deeper

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:27.200 
that we're lifting to give us deeper
tears<00:02:24.090> and<00:02:24.360> then<00:02:25.020> we're<00:02:25.140> also<00:02:25.460> increasing<00:02:26.460> the

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:27.210 
tears and then we're also increasing the

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:29.570 
tears and then we're also increasing the
synthesis<00:02:28.050> of<00:02:28.260> proteins<00:02:28.800> it's<00:02:29.280> going<00:02:29.520> to

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:29.580 
synthesis of proteins it's going to

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:32.030 
synthesis of proteins it's going to
repair<00:02:29.880> the<00:02:30.030> mustard<00:02:30.360> so<00:02:30.570> this<00:02:31.410> is<00:02:31.590> an<00:02:31.710> awesome

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:32.040 
repair the mustard so this is an awesome
