00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:20.310
 hello welcome to all of you on 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:21.660
 that when you had today a 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:23.070
 new introductory video that carries 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:25.260
 on a diet the brand new 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:27.000
 antec truepower classic a 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:28.619
 food that is rather 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.869
 classic is marked in its reference 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:32.790
 since not modular but who wants to 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:35.460
 propose the essentials with a 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:38.010
 80plus gold certification a guarantee 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:39.780
 of 5 years 650 watts has seen it's 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:42.300
 marked on the box and a fan of 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:45.059
 120 mm and which is silent at all 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:46.590
 will be sold at a price of 110 euros and 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:47.850
 propose you to go around this 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:51.539
 diet was right away it's 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:53.699
 now it's sure that at tv code like 

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:55.140
 always we start with the bundle is 

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:56.760
 in the latter you will find a 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:58.649
 instructions for use 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:02.190
 the screws and finally a cord 

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:04.860
 feeding we are now at 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:05.309
 top 7 truepower classic version 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:07.350
 gold 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:08.760
 we will first talk about the cables 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:10.409
 sees the cables are of type no 

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:12.990
 modular but we have a sheath that is 

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:15.030
 very thick with cables that are 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:17.400
 rather tending black pretty much 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:18.840
 everywhere with thermo sheath which is 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:20.729
 stuck so rather a very good 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:21.840
 finishing at that level at the level of 

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:26.340
 connectors we will find on this 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:29.490
 point there 1.24 bracha brown tx2 which 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:29.790
 offers two pci express 6 + 8 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:32.220
 pine 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:34.829
 so we can driver 2 cards 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:36.840
 graphics in celi without any problem 

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:39.990
 and we will also find a case 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:42.500
 trippin cpu on the arm at destination 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:47.399
 devices you are going to find 

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:49.740
 two cables including one that offers three 

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:52.409
 taken sata and a molex plug 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:54.270
 so that makes us so this a2 molex on 

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:56.969
 of brown and then we will find a 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:59.790
 strand that offers 3 accurate molex more 

00:01:56.969 --> 00:02:02.460
 a floppy plug the connector is so 

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:04.229
 rather consistent for a model of 650 

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:05.549
 watts are we now attaching to the block 

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:07.350
 feeding first we see it 

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:09.929
 if we put the food in the 

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:11.860
 case like these we have the 

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:15.400
 right to a sticker that is 

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:17.080
 my sense is rather a good thing 

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:20.170
 starts at the back at the back we have 

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:21.810
 of course the grid with nest design 

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:25.120
 of bees as always the enough in 

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:27.700
 the switch on the sides we have 

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:32.170
 teak stickers true power 

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:34.450
 classic in yellow and black with a logo 

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:37.630
 in teak that is hit in the carcass 

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:40.690
 on this side on the top we find the 

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:42.820
 120mm fan that is given 

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:44.440
 for silencer with a fine grid 

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:47.140
 black and a teak logo 

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:48.790
 if we go back further we have the 

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:52.120
 device for different 

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:53.530
 power connectors finally we have 

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:55.840
 below the characteristics 

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:59.200
 block techniques that are given for 

00:02:55.840 --> 00:03:01.300
 1 5 volt 20 years loses 1 3 volts 3 of 

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:01.780
 20 years loses and we find two rails 12 

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:04.930
 volt 

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:07.360
 both are 30 amps each for 648 

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:10.930
 watts of power all in 80 plus 

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:13.209
 gold with pulse a 5 year warranty 

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:13.660
 as we said and a price of 110 

00:03:13.209 --> 00:03:15.730
 euros 

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:16.900
 see you soon on gog 

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:18.580
 full of points as for the test 

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:20.739
 complete this diet and on 

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:23.400
 coco tv for our next videos of 

00:03:20.739 --> 00:03:23.400
