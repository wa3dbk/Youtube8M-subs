00:00:02.740 --> 00:00:07.779
 go back to basics keep basics 

00:00:05.170 --> 00:00:09.880
 as the name suggests it is here 

00:00:07.779 --> 00:00:11.679
 where the beginning closed good basic posture 

00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:13.150
 able to properly 

00:00:11.679 --> 00:00:15.040
 unfortunately we see that there is a lot of error 

00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:17.110
 people do not become the basic attitude 

00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:18.880
 sufficient control and therefore 

00:00:17.110 --> 00:00:20.980
 hinder themselves to themselves 

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:23.109
 maybe it's nice but 

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:25.090
 show ideal basic posture is for 

00:00:23.109 --> 00:00:26.590
 the modern cox is not the goal of the 

00:00:25.090 --> 00:00:28.839
 job that is my weight 

00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:31.269
 optimal or maybe right away I felt 

00:00:28.839 --> 00:00:33.880
 we do three things at the same time 

00:00:31.269 --> 00:00:36.010
 i stand on my whole i should except 

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:37.990
 while greening that when 

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:41.890
 the shins are full 

00:00:37.990 --> 00:00:43.780
 from my shoes to bad to sturdy 

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:45.850
 to be able to stand up and to ski 

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:48.460
 easy to tilt the whole 

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:50.890
 sound wise to assist how we do 

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:53.410
 in the then it ensures words that are minimal 

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:56.110
 wide and where do I leave the arms and 

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:58.390
 you love my hands as far as that 

00:00:56.110 --> 00:01:02.320
 for even me with my elbows 

00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:04.780
 friend for my torso 

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:07.149
 can best use tilt 

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:09.549
 my hips with knees and ankles 

00:01:07.149 --> 00:01:11.530
 it is important that this is the same 

00:01:09.549 --> 00:01:12.820
 do so finish im out one 

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:14.679
 phelps sides 

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:16.600
 into the corner that I make in my ankles 

00:01:14.679 --> 00:01:18.100
 my knees hips need so much 

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:22.170
 may be the same 

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:22.170
 we call that parallelism 

00:01:22.499 --> 00:01:27.429
 beat the axes of parallelism with you 

00:01:25.299 --> 00:01:29.530
 that you can ski it inside and your booty 

00:01:27.429 --> 00:01:31.539
 three are tilted the same amount 

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:32.920
 Common errors are the following 

00:01:31.539 --> 00:01:34.000
 the first is that people are way too narrow 

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:36.580
 stand well 

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:38.860
 difficult to balance is the second 

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:40.660
 people angle too much out of a joint 

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:42.430
 for example from your knees so that not 

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:44.110
 do not do any of the more joint joints 

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:46.540
 and the third is that knife is too low 

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:48.250
 stand too much the afterwards commission and 

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:49.570
 I may not be able to drive anymore 

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:51.700
 if you go to jail with these tips 

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:54.450
 exaggerate then you can really good 

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:54.450
 feel what happens
