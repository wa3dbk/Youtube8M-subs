00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
while sitting in your car and if you

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:03.830 
while sitting in your car and if you

as one of the cities there's a nine-man
parametric<00:01:52.210> EQ<00:01:52.570> let's<00:01:53.200> take<00:01:53.410> one<00:01:53.620> band<00:01:53.890> and

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:54.340 
parametric EQ let's take one band and

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:58.580 
parametric EQ let's take one band and
you<00:01:54.910> can<00:01:55.090> see<00:01:55.210> it<00:01:55.330> set<00:01:55.480> up<00:01:55.600> so<00:01:55.660> 1k<00:01:56.350> table<00:01:57.190> -<00:01:57.430> 2<00:01:57.790> dB

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:58.590 
you can see it set up so 1k table - 2 dB

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:01.530 
you can see it set up so 1k table - 2 dB
see<00:01:59.590> how<00:01:59.830> you<00:01:59.890> can<00:02:00.100> fit<00:02:00.340> by<00:02:00.790> hand<00:02:01.030> that's<00:02:01.330> what

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:01.540 
see how you can fit by hand that's what

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:06.630 
see how you can fit by hand that's what
the<00:02:01.600> plus<00:02:01.810> for<00:02:02.050> maybe<00:02:02.470> a<00:02:02.500> 100<00:02:03.150> Q<00:02:04.150> factor<00:02:05.640> you

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:06.640 
the plus for maybe a 100 Q factor you

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:08.520 
the plus for maybe a 100 Q factor you
never<00:02:06.880> sure<00:02:07.150> what<00:02:07.450> it<00:02:07.570> is<00:02:07.690> I<00:02:07.720> can<00:02:08.110> always<00:02:08.350> talk

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:08.530 
never sure what it is I can always talk

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:11.730 
never sure what it is I can always talk

to my information screen it explains to

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:16.449 
to my information screen it explains to
you<00:02:11.980> what<00:02:12.460> exactly<00:02:12.970> you're<00:02:13.420> doing

00:02:16.449 --> 00:02:16.459 

00:02:16.459 --> 00:02:19.119 

the<00:02:16.939> other<00:02:17.060> settings<00:02:17.540> is<00:02:18.409> a<00:02:18.560> big<00:02:18.739> witchy

00:02:19.119 --> 00:02:19.129 
the other settings is a big witchy

00:02:19.129 --> 00:02:22.030 
the other settings is a big witchy
because<00:02:19.430> it's<00:02:19.549> a<00:02:19.670> new<00:02:20.349> cycle<00:02:21.349> the<00:02:21.799> time

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:22.040 
because it's a new cycle the time

got<00:02:37.810> the<00:02:38.220> crossovers<00:02:39.220> front<00:02:39.580> I<00:02:39.730> pass<00:02:40.000> you<00:02:40.599> can

00:02:40.619 --> 00:02:40.629 
got the crossovers front I pass you can

00:02:40.629 --> 00:02:44.809 
got the crossovers front I pass you can
adjust<00:02:41.049> the<00:02:41.170> slope<00:02:41.549> therefore<00:02:43.019> frequency

00:02:44.809 --> 00:02:44.819 
adjust the slope therefore frequency

00:02:44.819 --> 00:02:49.679 
adjust the slope therefore frequency
