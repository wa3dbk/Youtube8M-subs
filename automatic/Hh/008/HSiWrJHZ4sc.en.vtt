00:00:13.420 --> 00:00:15.960
Grif, just remain calm, okay?

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:20.240
Calm?! I'm surrounded by aliens and I think they're trying to kill me.

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:22.180
They're definitely trying to kill me.

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:24.960
Grif, do you know where Simmons is? Grif?

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:27.840
Hello?
- Oh god! I don't wanna die!

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:29.040
You'll die!

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:32.720
Sounds like your buddy wandered into a firefight mode.

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:33.740
What's that?

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:36.220
He has to fight wave after wave of aliens till it's over.

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:38.220
When is it over?
- When he dies.

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:41.940
Hmm, well that's not so good, on the plus side, though it shouldn't take too long.

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:45.360
Hey, let him know if he pre-ordered from Gamestop and get some new armor.

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:48.160
Uh, not sure he stands a chance either way.

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:51.780
Well, he could find his way to multiplayer, he could enter a one versus one tournament.

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:53.840
He has to be one of the ones.

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:56.200
Yeah.
- It seems like a bad idea for him.

00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:58.800
Well, they have prizes for four versus four tournaments too.

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:01.760
You got any four versus three and a half compitition?

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:04.520
No.
- Then he probably wouldn't qualify.

Oh brother, finally.

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:08.860
Hey, what's up Sarge?
- Grif...!

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:11.820
You made it!
- Barely, those aliens never seem to stop.

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:14.240
So eventually, I just played dead and they left.

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:15.940
Then I fell asleep for a few hours.

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:17.980
Playing dead is more work than I'm used to.

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:21.160
Where have you guys been?
-  I got stuck all the way across the map.

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:22.680
This place is huge!

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:24.640
And I got attacked by a bunch of aliens.

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:26.520
At least you had to win some prizes.

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:29.280
I've been trying to hold the Blues by myself.

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:31.760
Simmons, why are they shooting at each other?

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:36.120
Oh, I told them if they didn't attacked us, I would trade them my pre-order code for the exclusive chest piece.

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:37.760
Now they're fighting each other to see who gets it.

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:39.980
Bar code!
- But you already used your code,

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:41.140
...you're wearing it.

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:42.300
Yeah, but don't know that.

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:46.800
See fellas, I guess my plan worked after all. Now let's get ready for Reach!

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:48.360
And I'm gonna take a nap first.

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:53.500
Oh you can't, the delivery guy stopped by, you won one of the Noble Team statues. It takes up your whole bunk.

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:55.240
Whoa! This thing is huge!
