00:00:32.170 --> 00:00:32.180 
after that you wanna use your index and

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:35.200

just want to hit the fourth string

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:29.130 
just want to hit the fourth string
fourth<00:01:25.030> fret<00:01:25.149> and<00:01:25.920> play<00:01:26.920> a<00:01:26.950> power<00:01:27.280> cord<00:01:27.729> on<00:01:28.140> the

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:29.140 
fourth fret and play a power cord on the

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:32.130 
fourth fret and play a power cord on the
fifth<00:01:30.130> string<00:01:30.250> third<00:01:30.700> fret<00:01:31.020> fourth<00:01:32.020> string

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:32.140 
fifth string third fret fourth string

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:35.850 
fifth string third fret fourth string
fifth<00:01:32.740> fret

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:35.860 

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:38.550 

you<00:01:36.460> can<00:01:36.670> choose<00:01:36.880> to<00:01:37.270> play<00:01:37.630> the<00:01:37.900> power<00:01:38.170> cord<00:01:38.440> of

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:38.560 
you can choose to play the power cord of

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:39.780 
you can choose to play the power cord of
the<00:01:38.650> pic<00:01:38.830> but<00:01:39.010> it's<00:01:39.130> probably<00:01:39.280> going<00:01:39.640> to<00:01:39.700> be

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:39.790 
the pic but it's probably going to be

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:42.120 
the pic but it's probably going to be
harder<00:01:40.210> to<00:01:40.240> pick<00:01:40.540> the<00:01:40.660> pick<00:01:40.810> right<00:01:41.140> up<00:01:41.170> because

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:42.130 
harder to pick the pick right up because

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:44.460 
harder to pick the pick right up because
the<00:01:42.220> intro<00:01:42.520> goes<00:01:42.700> pretty<00:01:42.820> fast<00:01:43.090> so<00:01:43.630> by<00:01:44.170> the<00:01:44.230> end

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:44.470 
the intro goes pretty fast so by the end

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:45.870 
the intro goes pretty fast so by the end
of<00:01:44.560> this<00:01:44.740> video<00:01:44.950> you<00:01:45.190> should<00:01:45.310> end<00:01:45.700> up<00:01:45.850> with

00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:45.880 
of this video you should end up with

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:55.200 
of this video you should end up with
