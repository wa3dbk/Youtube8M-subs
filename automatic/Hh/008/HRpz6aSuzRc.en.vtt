super Reds bearings these are just like

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:01.580 
super Reds bearings these are just like
the<00:01:58.560> regular<00:01:58.740> or<00:01:59.189> original<00:01:59.789> Reds<00:02:00.000> but<00:02:00.590> they

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590 
the regular or original Reds but they

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:05.149 
the regular or original Reds but they
are<00:02:01.920> a<00:02:02.700> higher<00:02:03.209> grade<00:02:03.479> steel<00:02:03.780> I<00:02:04.079> believe<00:02:04.349> so

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:05.159

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:07.520

they<00:02:05.280> last<00:02:05.459> longer<00:02:06.170> they<00:02:07.170> roll<00:02:07.380> a<00:02:07.409> little

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:07.530 
they last longer they roll a little

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:10.729 
they last longer they roll a little
smoother<00:02:08.160> and<00:02:08.989> you<00:02:09.989> just<00:02:10.140> get<00:02:10.259> a<00:02:10.319> little<00:02:10.470> more

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:10.739 
smoother and you just get a little more

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:12.800 
smoother and you just get a little more
for<00:02:10.950> your<00:02:11.039> money<00:02:11.190> so<00:02:11.579> these<00:02:12.450> are<00:02:12.599> a<00:02:12.630> great
