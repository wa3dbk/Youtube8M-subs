00:00:10.029 --> 00:00:10.039 
reflectors series now in this one

00:00:10.039 --> 00:00:11.320 
reflectors series now in this one
actually<00:00:10.309> want<00:00:10.639> to<00:00:10.670> show<00:00:10.850> you<00:00:10.910> something<00:00:11.299> that

00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:11.330

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:13.090 
actually want to show you something that
isn't<00:00:11.780> about<00:00:11.869> reflecting<00:00:12.559> light<00:00:12.740> it's<00:00:12.920> about

00:00:13.090 --> 00:00:13.100 
isn't about reflecting light it's about

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:15.039 
isn't about reflecting light it's about
defusing<00:00:13.549> light<00:00:13.820> but<00:00:14.270> if<00:00:14.360> you've<00:00:14.510> got<00:00:14.750> one<00:00:14.930> of

00:00:15.039 --> 00:00:15.049 
defusing light but if you've got one of

00:00:15.049 --> 00:00:17.380 
defusing light but if you've got one of
these<00:00:15.139> big<00:00:15.469> five-in-one<00:00:16.460> reflectors<00:00:17.179> the

00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:17.390 
these big five-in-one reflectors the

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:19.810 
these big five-in-one reflectors the
central<00:00:17.779> section<00:00:18.230> is<00:00:18.410> translucent<00:00:19.279> and<00:00:19.369> you

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:19.820 
central section is translucent and you

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:21.700 
central section is translucent and you
can<00:00:20.000> use<00:00:20.179> that<00:00:20.359> as<00:00:20.539> a<00:00:20.570> big<00:00:20.900> diffuser<00:00:21.380> now<00:00:21.619> you

00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:21.710 
can use that as a big diffuser now you

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:23.290 
can use that as a big diffuser now you
can<00:00:21.859> see<00:00:22.039> we're<00:00:22.220> out<00:00:22.369> on<00:00:22.400> a<00:00:22.580> really<00:00:22.880> Glary

00:00:23.290 --> 00:00:23.300

can see we're out on a really Glary
bright<00:00:23.630> day<00:00:23.900> and<00:00:24.199> there's<00:00:25.009> a<00:00:25.099> lot<00:00:25.279> of<00:00:25.400> light

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:25.580 
bright day and there's a lot of light

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:27.700 
bright day and there's a lot of light
here<00:00:25.609> that<00:00:26.089> we're<00:00:26.300> able<00:00:26.480> to<00:00:26.749> cut<00:00:26.960> down<00:00:26.990> so

00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:27.710 
here that we're able to cut down so

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:29.259 
here that we're able to cut down so
using<00:00:28.189> the<00:00:28.279> big<00:00:28.429> diffuser<00:00:28.820> we're<00:00:29.029> going<00:00:29.150> to<00:00:29.210> be

take the cover off that one as I said
the<00:00:45.050> inside<00:00:45.500> is<00:00:45.769> just<00:00:45.980> a<00:00:46.070> massive<00:00:46.309> diffusion

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:47.030

for weddings this is essentially the

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:56.680 
for weddings this is essentially the
same<00:00:55.070> thing<00:00:55.399> just<00:00:55.640> it's<00:00:55.850> included<00:00:56.179> kind<00:00:56.600> of

same thing just it's included kind of

00:00:56.690 --> 00:00:59.200 
same thing just it's included kind of
free<00:00:56.989> in<00:00:57.230> your<00:00:57.289> five-in-one<00:00:57.800> reflector<00:00:58.489> the

00:00:59.200 --> 00:00:59.210 
free in your five-in-one reflector the

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:00.430 
free in your five-in-one reflector the
zipper<00:00:59.480> is<00:00:59.600> really<00:00:59.870> tricky<00:01:00.050> though<00:01:00.289> we

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:00.440 
zipper is really tricky though we

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:01.840 
zipper is really tricky though we
already<00:01:00.559> broke<00:01:00.829> that<00:01:01.010> this<00:01:01.219> morning<00:01:01.579> so<00:01:01.699> we'll

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:01.850 
already broke that this morning so we'll

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:03.579 
already broke that this morning so we'll
get<00:01:01.969> that<00:01:02.089> off<00:01:02.269> and<00:01:02.539> then<00:01:03.170> show<00:01:03.410> you

00:01:03.579 --> 00:01:03.589 
get that off and then show you

00:01:03.589 --> 00:01:07.450 
get that off and then show you
so<00:01:04.100> with<00:01:04.280> this<00:01:04.430> die<00:01:04.760> it<00:01:05.330> is<00:01:05.750> almost<00:01:06.170> opaque<00:01:06.920> but

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:07.460 
so with this die it is almost opaque but

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:09.340 
so with this die it is almost opaque but
it<00:01:07.700> does<00:01:08.000> have<00:01:08.240> light<00:01:08.450> transmission<00:01:08.930> so<00:01:09.200> it's

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:09.350 
it does have light transmission so it's

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:11.320 
it does have light transmission so it's
perfect<00:01:09.860> for<00:01:10.070> really<00:01:10.400> bright<00:01:10.760> days<00:01:11.000> where

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:11.330 
perfect for really bright days where

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:13.360 
perfect for really bright days where
it's<00:01:11.870> okay<00:01:12.290> to<00:01:12.350> be<00:01:12.530> cutting<00:01:12.740> down<00:01:12.980> the<00:01:13.190> light

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:13.370 
it's okay to be cutting down the light

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:14.890 
it's okay to be cutting down the light
so<00:01:13.580> you<00:01:13.640> can<00:01:13.850> probably<00:01:14.000> see<00:01:14.240> from<00:01:14.420> the<00:01:14.540> shadows

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:14.900 
so you can probably see from the shadows

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:16.930 
so you can probably see from the shadows
the<00:01:15.110> light<00:01:15.290> is<00:01:15.560> right<00:01:15.950> there<00:01:16.220> and<00:01:16.490> it's

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:16.940 
the light is right there and it's

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:18.670 
the light is right there and it's
creating<00:01:17.390> quite<00:01:17.600> hard<00:01:17.930> shadows<00:01:18.410> across

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:18.680 
creating quite hard shadows across

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:21.190 
creating quite hard shadows across
Tina's<00:01:19.340> face<00:01:19.580> so<00:01:20.180> I'll<00:01:20.390> take<00:01:20.600> a<00:01:20.630> sample<00:01:20.930> shot

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:21.200 
Tina's face so I'll take a sample shot

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:22.930 
Tina's face so I'll take a sample shot
of<00:01:21.290> that<00:01:21.470> then<00:01:21.950> all<00:01:22.100> we<00:01:22.220> have<00:01:22.250> to<00:01:22.400> do<00:01:22.550> is<00:01:22.670> pop

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:22.940 
of that then all we have to do is pop

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:25.000 
of that then all we have to do is pop
the<00:01:23.090> diffuser<00:01:23.450> between<00:01:23.930> her<00:01:24.170> and<00:01:24.350> that<00:01:24.470> and<00:01:24.650> it

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:25.010 
the diffuser between her and that and it

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:26.830 
the diffuser between her and that and it
turns<00:01:25.280> the<00:01:25.490> light<00:01:25.640> source<00:01:25.910> from<00:01:26.120> you<00:01:26.570> know<00:01:26.690> the

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:26.840 
turns the light source from you know the

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:28.840 
turns the light source from you know the
Sun<00:01:27.050> which<00:01:27.320> has<00:01:27.350> an<00:01:27.650> apparent<00:01:27.950> size<00:01:28.280> of<00:01:28.460> a<00:01:28.520> pea

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:28.850 
Sun which has an apparent size of a pea

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:31.150 
Sun which has an apparent size of a pea
in<00:01:29.030> the<00:01:29.180> sky<00:01:29.450> to<00:01:30.110> this<00:01:30.230> enormous<00:01:30.620> thing<00:01:30.830> which

00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:31.160 
in the sky to this enormous thing which

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:33.640 
in the sky to this enormous thing which
is<00:01:31.370> like<00:01:31.610> bigger<00:01:32.450> than<00:01:32.600> any<00:01:32.780> softbox<00:01:33.350> you<00:01:33.500> can

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:33.650 
is like bigger than any softbox you can

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:35.110 
is like bigger than any softbox you can
