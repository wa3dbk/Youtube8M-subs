and that's the action in just the arm
itself<00:00:13.429> now<00:00:14.429> in<00:00:14.549> order<00:00:14.790> to<00:00:14.969> do<00:00:15.150> the<00:00:15.929> early

00:00:16.189 --> 00:00:16.199 
itself now in order to do the early

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:18.830 
itself now in order to do the early
vertical<00:00:16.350> forearm<00:00:16.590> you<00:00:17.220> must<00:00:17.970> get<00:00:18.240> the<00:00:18.420> elbow

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:18.840 
vertical forearm you must get the elbow

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:21.590 
vertical forearm you must get the elbow
either<00:00:19.740> up<00:00:20.039> on<00:00:20.310> top<00:00:20.970> of<00:00:21.119> the<00:00:21.210> arm<00:00:21.390> or

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:21.600 
either up on top of the arm or

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:24.349 
either up on top of the arm or
definitely<00:00:22.529> above<00:00:22.680> horizontal<00:00:23.180> and<00:00:24.180> what<00:00:24.330> I

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:24.359 
definitely above horizontal and what I

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:27.410 
definitely above horizontal and what I
mean<00:00:24.539> by<00:00:24.600> that<00:00:24.750> is<00:00:25.140> getting<00:00:26.070> it<00:00:26.160> up<00:00:26.310> there<00:00:26.519> so

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:27.420 
mean by that is getting it up there so

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:30.230 
mean by that is getting it up there so
that<00:00:27.599> way<00:00:27.810> the<00:00:28.650> arm<00:00:28.859> can<00:00:29.070> fold<00:00:29.400> underneath<00:00:29.970> it

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:30.240 
that way the arm can fold underneath it

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:34.310 
that way the arm can fold underneath it
if<00:00:30.619> the<00:00:31.619> elbows<00:00:31.980> to<00:00:32.279> the<00:00:32.309> side<00:00:32.669> I<00:00:33.320> obviously

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:34.320 
if the elbows to the side I obviously

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:36.139 
if the elbows to the side I obviously
can't<00:00:34.770> bend<00:00:35.160> my<00:00:35.309> arm<00:00:35.489> down<00:00:35.700> it's<00:00:35.969> going<00:00:36.059> to

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:12.290 

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:16.699 

my<00:02:13.290> elbow<00:02:13.709> rotates<00:02:14.489> on<00:02:14.670> top<00:02:15.000> as<00:02:15.349> my<00:02:16.349> spear

00:02:16.699 --> 00:02:16.709 
my elbow rotates on top as my spear

00:02:16.709 --> 00:02:19.820 
my elbow rotates on top as my spear
happens<00:02:17.190> okay<00:02:18.180> and<00:02:18.420> then<00:02:18.989> that<00:02:19.200> sets<00:02:19.590> me<00:02:19.769> up

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:19.830 
happens okay and then that sets me up

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:23.000 
happens okay and then that sets me up
for<00:02:19.920> a<00:02:20.160> good<00:02:20.370> catch<00:02:21.330> scenario<00:02:21.870> as<00:02:22.049> the<00:02:22.890> other

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:23.010 
for a good catch scenario as the other

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:26.960 
for a good catch scenario as the other
arm<00:02:23.250> comes<00:02:23.310> in<00:02:24.620> now<00:02:25.620> that's<00:02:25.890> the<00:02:26.190> more

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:26.970 
arm comes in now that's the more

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:29.120 
arm comes in now that's the more
difficult<00:02:27.180> way<00:02:27.540> I<00:02:27.840> encourage<00:02:28.680> you<00:02:28.799> to<00:02:28.920> play

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:29.130 
difficult way I encourage you to play

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:30.530 
difficult way I encourage you to play
with<00:02:29.280> that<00:02:29.459> it<00:02:29.670> took<00:02:29.819> me<00:02:30.000> a<00:02:30.030> while<00:02:30.209> to<00:02:30.269> figure

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:30.540 
with that it took me a while to figure

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:33.559 
with that it took me a while to figure
out<00:02:30.810> how<00:02:31.500> to<00:02:31.560> turn<00:02:31.890> my<00:02:32.099> elbow<00:02:32.430> on<00:02:32.459> top<00:02:32.569> without

00:02:33.559 --> 00:02:33.569 
out how to turn my elbow on top without

00:02:33.569 --> 00:02:35.870 
out how to turn my elbow on top without
moving<00:02:34.560> my<00:02:34.590> hand<00:02:34.920> or<00:02:35.130> doing<00:02:35.310> something<00:02:35.489> here

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:35.880 
moving my hand or doing something here

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:38.839 
moving my hand or doing something here
okay<00:02:36.799> now<00:02:37.799> the<00:02:37.890> other<00:02:38.010> way<00:02:38.280> to<00:02:38.310> do<00:02:38.519> this<00:02:38.640> which

00:02:38.839 --> 00:02:38.849 
okay now the other way to do this which

00:02:38.849 --> 00:02:40.190 
okay now the other way to do this which
is<00:02:39.000> probably<00:02:39.120> a<00:02:39.329> little<00:02:39.420> more<00:02:39.660> easier<00:02:39.989> and

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:40.200 
is probably a little more easier and

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:43.009 
is probably a little more easier and
thanks<00:02:40.980> to<00:02:41.160> coach<00:02:42.030> Dave<00:02:42.269> Cameron<00:02:42.690> for<00:02:42.900> this

00:02:43.009 --> 00:02:43.019 
thanks to coach Dave Cameron for this

00:02:43.019 --> 00:02:48.830 
thanks to coach Dave Cameron for this
one<00:02:43.200> is<00:02:43.579> to<00:02:44.579> simply<00:02:47.269> rotate<00:02:48.269> your<00:02:48.450> thumb<00:02:48.660> down

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:48.840 
one is to simply rotate your thumb down

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:51.050 
one is to simply rotate your thumb down
about<00:02:49.440> five<00:02:49.680> degrees<00:02:49.829> just<00:02:50.250> a<00:02:50.459> tiny<00:02:50.639> bit<00:02:50.850> and

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:51.060 
about five degrees just a tiny bit and

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:54.099 
about five degrees just a tiny bit and
that<00:02:51.989> will<00:02:52.079> get<00:02:52.200> your<00:02:52.350> elbow<00:02:52.620> up<00:02:52.650> on<00:02:53.040> top<00:02:53.670> too

00:02:54.099 --> 00:02:54.109 
that will get your elbow up on top too

00:02:54.109 --> 00:02:58.970 
that will get your elbow up on top too
now<00:02:55.109> also<00:02:55.500> note<00:02:55.739> that<00:02:56.930> once<00:02:57.930> the<00:02:58.109> if<00:02:58.440> the<00:02:58.769> elbow

00:02:58.970 --> 00:02:58.980 
now also note that once the if the elbow

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:01.729 
now also note that once the if the elbow
is<00:02:59.100> not<00:02:59.130> all<00:02:59.549> the<00:02:59.910> way<00:03:00.000> on<00:03:00.120> top<00:03:00.299> as<00:03:01.260> long<00:03:01.620> as

00:03:01.729 --> 00:03:01.739 
is not all the way on top as long as

00:03:01.739 --> 00:03:03.770 
is not all the way on top as long as
it's<00:03:01.889> higher<00:03:02.040> than<00:03:02.069> a<00:03:02.310> horizontal<00:03:02.940> should<00:03:03.660> be

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:03.780 
it's higher than a horizontal should be

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:06.229 
it's higher than a horizontal should be
okay<00:03:04.049> because<00:03:04.950> once<00:03:05.370> you've<00:03:05.519> been<00:03:05.670> down<00:03:05.850> and

00:03:06.229 --> 00:03:06.239 
okay because once you've been down and

00:03:06.239 --> 00:03:10.640 
okay because once you've been down and
remember<00:03:06.690> as<00:03:06.870> I'm<00:03:07.859> turning<00:03:08.600> to<00:03:09.600> catch<00:03:09.870> and<00:03:10.230> my

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:10.650 
remember as I'm turning to catch and my

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:14.240 
remember as I'm turning to catch and my
body<00:03:10.920> is<00:03:11.069> also<00:03:11.250> turning<00:03:11.840> that<00:03:12.840> angle<00:03:13.290> will

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:14.250 
body is also turning that angle will

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:16.160 
body is also turning that angle will
allow<00:03:14.459> me<00:03:14.639> to<00:03:14.670> have<00:03:14.760> my<00:03:15.090> hand<00:03:15.389> and<00:03:15.600> fingers

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:16.170 
allow me to have my hand and fingers

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:18.050 
allow me to have my hand and fingers
pointing<00:03:16.530> downward<00:03:16.980> by<00:03:17.430> the<00:03:17.489> time<00:03:17.760> my<00:03:17.910> body

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:18.060 
pointing downward by the time my body

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:20.420 
pointing downward by the time my body
turns<00:03:18.450> okay<00:03:19.440> so<00:03:19.500> you<00:03:19.680> don't<00:03:19.920> really<00:03:20.160> need<00:03:20.370> to

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:20.430 
turns okay so you don't really need to

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:24.050 
turns okay so you don't really need to
have<00:03:20.670> the<00:03:20.790> oval<00:03:21.090> fully<00:03:21.840> on<00:03:22.079> top<00:03:22.730> just<00:03:23.730> enough

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:24.060 
have the oval fully on top just enough

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:25.910 
have the oval fully on top just enough
on<00:03:24.209> top<00:03:24.420> so<00:03:24.660> I<00:03:24.720> can<00:03:24.750> bend<00:03:25.079> it<00:03:25.170> down<00:03:25.230> you<00:03:25.620> can<00:03:25.680> see

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:25.920 
on top so I can bend it down you can see

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:28.400 
on top so I can bend it down you can see
even<00:03:26.010> the<00:03:26.220> angle<00:03:26.549> of<00:03:26.639> my<00:03:26.760> arm<00:03:26.970> is<00:03:27.209> is<00:03:27.450> not<00:03:28.109> like

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:28.410 
even the angle of my arm is is not like

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:31.190 
even the angle of my arm is is not like
like<00:03:28.829> that<00:03:29.099> which<00:03:29.639> is<00:03:29.670> straight<00:03:30.269> downward<00:03:30.660> but

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:31.200 
like that which is straight downward but

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:34.490 
like that which is straight downward but
it's<00:03:31.349> a<00:03:31.410> little<00:03:31.620> bit<00:03:31.739> off<00:03:32.810> and<00:03:33.810> there<00:03:34.230> you<00:03:34.349> have

00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:34.500 
it's a little bit off and there you have

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:38.990 
it's a little bit off and there you have
it<00:03:34.650> the<00:03:35.639> first<00:03:35.880> part<00:03:36.180> of<00:03:36.410> getting<00:03:37.549> the<00:03:38.549> mat<00:03:38.790> the

00:03:38.990 --> 00:03:39.000 
it the first part of getting the mat the

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:42.500 
it the first part of getting the mat the
mastery<00:03:39.599> of<00:03:39.750> early<00:03:40.109> vertical<00:03:40.290> forearm
