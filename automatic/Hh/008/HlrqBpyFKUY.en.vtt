 seen in winter the clothes that I'm going to 

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:56.239
 show is a little light maybe for 

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:59.090
 some countries where snow falls and makes a 

00:00:56.239 --> 00:01:01.190
 huge cold but keep in mind that I 

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:03.110
 I live in a Caribbean country and here in 

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:05.120
 my country really is not that cold 

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:07.250
 Now I'm going to leave you with a guest 

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:08.840

 I bring you the makeup tutorial 

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:15.530
 for winter is something super simple 

00:01:12.799 --> 00:01:18.380
 super easy to do but above all very 

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:20.119
 pretty and very trendy so I hope 

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:22.580

00:01:20.119 --> 00:01:26.350
 subscribe comment and leave me tulio 

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:26.350
 like now 19 europe 

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:33.100
 the first out fit is super simple and 

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:34.840
 casual I like it because you can 

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:37.450
 use in those days where 

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:39.310
 really not to be so cold because the 

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:41.590
 you can take it off when 

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:44.170
 go in heat or the weather changes a 

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:46.270
 little work that I have bought it in 

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:48.730
 a local store in my country the jacket 

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:51.880
 is from an Asian store called rose 

00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:54.870
 consell and the trousers is for every 

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:57.870
 One the shirt and the boots are from 

00:01:54.870 --> 00:01:57.870
 aeropostal 

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:07.030
 so low relations 

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:18.129
 in the second outfit I decided more for 

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:19.840
 the color gray because it is a color a 

00:02:18.129 --> 00:02:21.849
 little bit more suitable for the time in the 

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:23.439
 It's cold but to add a 

00:02:21.849 --> 00:02:25.329
 little bit of color I decided to bring this 

00:02:23.439 --> 00:02:28.060
 mint color scarf that is forever 

00:02:25.329 --> 00:02:29.739
 twenty one beat beanie my sweater and 

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:32.170
 also the pants are forever 

00:02:29.739 --> 00:02:34.060
 find out the shoes are made of banana 

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:36.549
 republic and the fruit that I wear 

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:37.959
 this or navy this background I like because 

00:02:36.549 --> 00:02:40.299
 just like the others if you go in like this 

00:02:37.959 --> 00:02:42.489
 calorcito as you can go removing 

00:02:40.299 --> 00:02:46.829
 some of the pieces and besides being 

00:02:42.489 --> 00:02:46.829
 super comfortable anyway equal 

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:06.860
 and when it does a little bit more cold 

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:09.320
 we should go as well as a little more 

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:11.090
 warm I must say that this is my 

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:12.830
 favorite of the three I think it's because 

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:15.380
 no I'll never use my power 

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:17.960
 country but in the end the hat that I wear 

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:19.910
 put is forever twenty one the 

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:22.700
 scarf also this for every one is 

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:24.710
 one of those that are circular blank 

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:27.560
 and black the sweater that I wear is also 

00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:30.050
 Guess that of for every one my boots 

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:33.590
 are purchased at a local store and the 

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:35.450
 gloves are from Sami 3 the pants are not 

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:37.220
 I remember what Asian store it was that 

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:38.840
 I bought it but it was one of those 

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:42.640
 Asian stores that find them 

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:42.640
 I believe anywhere anyway 

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:53.460

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:53.460
