can do some really cool stuff with this
as<00:01:31.000> well<00:01:31.770> now<00:01:32.770> if<00:01:33.009> you<00:01:33.130> don't<00:01:33.310> have<00:01:33.490> access<00:01:33.820> to

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:34.180 
as well now if you don't have access to

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:37.200 
as well now if you don't have access to
airplay<00:01:34.630> on<00:01:34.840> your<00:01:35.469> Mac<00:01:35.729> the<00:01:36.729> next<00:01:37.030> thing<00:01:37.149> that

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:37.210 
airplay on your Mac the next thing that

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:39.840 
airplay on your Mac the next thing that
I<00:01:37.390> highly<00:01:37.719> recommend<00:01:37.840> is<00:01:38.409> memory<00:01:38.890> clean<00:01:39.250> so

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:39.850 
I highly recommend is memory clean so

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:41.490 
I highly recommend is memory clean so
basically<00:01:40.210> what<00:01:40.479> this<00:01:40.600> allows<00:01:40.840> you<00:01:41.049> to<00:01:41.140> do<00:01:41.289> is

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:41.500 
basically what this allows you to do is

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:44.279 
basically what this allows you to do is
free<00:01:41.920> up<00:01:42.159> some<00:01:42.659> system<00:01:43.659> memory<00:01:43.869> that<00:01:44.170> is

00:01:44.279 --> 00:01:44.289 
free up some system memory that is

00:01:44.289 --> 00:01:46.529 
free up some system memory that is
stored<00:01:44.530> in<00:01:44.829> your<00:01:44.979> cash<00:01:45.250> so<00:01:45.939> as<00:01:46.090> you<00:01:46.210> guys<00:01:46.329> can

00:01:46.529 --> 00:01:46.539 
stored in your cash so as you guys can

00:01:46.539 --> 00:01:49.580 
stored in your cash so as you guys can
see<00:01:46.600> it<00:01:46.840> says<00:01:46.990> I've<00:01:47.259> got<00:01:47.289> 16<00:01:47.890> gigs<00:01:48.189> in<00:01:48.430> here<00:01:48.640> but

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590 
see it says I've got 16 gigs in here but

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:52.590 
see it says I've got 16 gigs in here but
it<00:01:50.590> basically<00:01:50.799> just<00:01:51.130> say<00:01:51.490> clean<00:01:51.789> memory<00:01:52.299> and

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:52.600 
it basically just say clean memory and

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:55.230 
it basically just say clean memory and
it<00:01:53.229> cleans<00:01:53.649> up<00:01:53.859> your<00:01:54.100> system<00:01:54.490> makes<00:01:54.850> it<00:01:55.000> run<00:01:55.210> a

00:01:55.230 --> 00:01:55.240 
it cleans up your system makes it run a

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:58.440 
it cleans up your system makes it run a
lot<00:01:55.479> faster<00:01:55.950> than<00:01:56.950> it<00:01:57.009> currently<00:01:57.430> is<00:01:57.759> running

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:10.630 
called reflection and basically this

00:04:10.630 --> 00:04:14.000 
called reflection and basically this
allows<00:04:10.959> you<00:04:11.200> to<00:04:11.500> mirror<00:04:11.980> the<00:04:12.519> screen<00:04:13.000> on<00:04:13.300> your

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:14.010

00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:21.370 
here so basically reflection is running

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:24.590 
here so basically reflection is running
