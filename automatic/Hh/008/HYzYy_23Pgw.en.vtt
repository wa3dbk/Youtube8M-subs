this Rakhi rutted climb had been baked

00:06:49.020 --> 00:06:51.080 
this Rakhi rutted climb had been baked
too<00:06:49.320> but<00:06:49.890> it<00:06:49.980> was<00:06:50.100> good<00:06:50.310> for<00:06:50.520> practicing

00:06:51.080 --> 00:06:51.090

the<00:06:53.880> pegs<00:06:54.170> the<00:06:55.170> idea<00:06:55.650> is<00:06:55.770> to<00:06:55.920> keep<00:06:56.070> the<00:06:56.280> rear

the pegs the idea is to keep the rear

00:06:56.490 --> 00:06:59.150 
the pegs the idea is to keep the rear
wheel<00:06:56.760> weighted<00:06:57.480> and<00:06:57.720> just<00:06:58.290> use<00:06:58.530> a<00:06:58.560> leg<00:06:58.920> to
