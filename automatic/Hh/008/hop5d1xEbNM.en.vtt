 last 

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:54.150
 changing the course of history the

 agent Jota will travel to the 60s to 

00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:59.810
 avoid it I'm looking here you've seen 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:02.760
 a man of certain in that the risk 

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:05.670
 on this simple premise fits the 

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:07.890
 prequel of male black that retakes this 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:10.350
 history with 10 years of delay with 

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:12.510
 regarding the second delivery and with 15 

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:14.550
 years with respect to the first in his 

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:16.830
 leap in time will smith go after a 

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:19.380
 alien recently escaped from jail 

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:21.690
 lunar which seeks the younger version of 

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:23.580
 agent k to load it little more 

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:25.890
 we can tell from the plot without bursting 

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:27.900
 the film but we emphasize that 

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:30.720
 these last two characters the 

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:33.300
 alien and the young agent k result 

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:35.190
 excellent for different reasons the 

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:37.440
 first because it is very accomplished as 

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:38.820
 supervillain and the second because the 

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:40.830
 casting of georges browling in 

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:44.010
 substitution of the tommy lee jones of the 

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:45.720
 60 fits as a ring to the finger as normal 

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:48.120
 I would not expect too much from a 

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:50.400
 sequel past date and with a theme 

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:51.650
 something trite already but in this sense the 

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:52.710
 movie pleasantly surprises you 

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:54.720
 overcoming 

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:56.970
 very loosely the quality of the 

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:59.220
 second delivery and even the first 

00:02:56.970 --> 00:03:01.530
 in some scenes in any case if 

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:03.570
 you're going to go see the men in black 3 already 

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:05.460

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:07.170
 you can wait and luckily we can 

00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:09.720

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:11.700
 Summery blockbuster is fulfilled and with 

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:13.830
