00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:21.769 
mr. Matt and I'm still using a sample
that<00:00:19.140> I<00:00:19.170> got<00:00:19.380> from<00:00:19.529> Sephora<00:00:20.240> I've<00:00:21.240> used<00:00:21.539> this

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:21.779 
that I got from Sephora I've used this

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:24.800 
that I got from Sephora I've used this
probably<00:00:22.380> maybe<00:00:22.769> five<00:00:23.400> or<00:00:23.430> six<00:00:23.640> times<00:00:24.180> and<00:00:24.539> so

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:24.810 
probably maybe five or six times and so

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:27.500 
probably maybe five or six times and so
far<00:00:25.080> I<00:00:25.109> really<00:00:25.350> like<00:00:25.949> it<00:00:26.160> it<00:00:26.550> goes<00:00:26.880> on<00:00:27.119> super

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:27.510 
far I really like it it goes on super

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:31.060 
far I really like it it goes on super
smooth<00:00:28.199> and<00:00:28.590> it<00:00:29.340> controls<00:00:29.789> my<00:00:29.970> oils<00:00:30.510> and

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:31.070 
smooth and it controls my oils and

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:35.270 
smooth and it controls my oils and
probably<00:00:32.070> last<00:00:32.759> I<00:00:33.180> would<00:00:33.420> say<00:00:33.630> five<00:00:34.040> to<00:00:35.040> six

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:35.280 
probably last I would say five to six

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:37.250 
probably last I would say five to six
hours<00:00:35.610> without<00:00:35.760> blotting<00:00:36.420> which<00:00:36.600> is<00:00:36.809> really

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260 
hours without blotting which is really

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:38.119

nation<00:01:12.479> with<00:01:12.720> this<00:01:13.020> essence<00:01:13.560> of<00:01:13.710> beauty<00:01:13.950> dual

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
nation with this essence of beauty dual

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:17.600 
nation with this essence of beauty dual
ended<00:01:14.820> brush<00:01:15.000> and<00:01:15.890> the<00:01:16.890> reason<00:01:17.189> that<00:01:17.280> I<00:01:17.340> like

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
ended brush and the reason that I like

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:19.940 
ended brush and the reason that I like
this<00:01:17.790> foundation<00:01:18.270> so<00:01:18.479> much<00:01:18.930> is<00:01:19.259> that<00:01:19.590> it's

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 
this foundation so much is that it's

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:22.910 
this foundation so much is that it's
super<00:01:20.700> sheer<00:01:21.180> coverage<00:01:21.780> I<00:01:22.110> think<00:01:22.439> you<00:01:22.740> can

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
super sheer coverage I think you can

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:26.060 
super sheer coverage I think you can
maybe<00:01:23.100> get<00:01:23.400> the<00:01:24.210> light<00:01:24.479> to<00:01:24.509> medium<00:01:24.930> coverage<00:01:25.170> I

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.070 
maybe get the light to medium coverage I

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:29.510 
maybe get the light to medium coverage I
would<00:01:26.909> say<00:01:27.600> more<00:01:27.930> light<00:01:28.170> than<00:01:28.470> than<00:01:29.130> medium

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
would say more light than than medium

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:31.310 
would say more light than than medium
but<00:01:30.329> it's<00:01:30.570> really<00:01:30.840> good<00:01:30.990> for<00:01:31.140> days<00:01:31.290> that

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:31.320 
but it's really good for days that

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:33.830 
but it's really good for days that
you're<00:01:31.770> having<00:01:32.369> a<00:01:32.490> pretty<00:01:32.759> good<00:01:32.970> skin<00:01:33.270> day<00:01:33.509> and

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
you're having a pretty good skin day and

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:36.859 
you're having a pretty good skin day and
you<00:01:34.170> want<00:01:34.350> a<00:01:34.439> little<00:01:34.650> bit<00:01:34.860> of<00:01:35.100> coverage<00:01:35.869> but

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:36.869 
you want a little bit of coverage but

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:39.950 
you want a little bit of coverage but
you<00:01:37.200> want<00:01:37.470> to<00:01:37.790> have<00:01:38.790> your<00:01:38.939> natural<00:01:39.509> skin

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
you want to have your natural skin

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:42.790 
you want to have your natural skin
peeking<00:01:40.470> through

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:42.800 

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:46.000 

so<00:01:43.800> as<00:01:43.920> you<00:01:44.100> can<00:01:44.220> see<00:01:44.280> it<00:01:44.790> blends<00:01:45.150> in<00:01:45.420> very

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:46.010 
so as you can see it blends in very

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:49.310 
so as you can see it blends in very
seamlessly<00:01:47.010> the<00:01:47.820> color<00:01:48.120> is<00:01:48.420> perfect<00:01:48.750> for<00:01:49.200> my

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:49.320 
seamlessly the color is perfect for my

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:52.190 
seamlessly the color is perfect for my
skin<00:01:49.380> tone<00:01:49.830> and<00:01:50.100> it<00:01:50.850> almost<00:01:51.300> just<00:01:51.540> disappears

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:52.200 
skin tone and it almost just disappears

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:54.230 
skin tone and it almost just disappears
into<00:01:52.440> the<00:01:52.620> skin<00:01:52.920> which<00:01:53.250> is<00:01:53.460> exactly<00:01:54.000> what

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:54.240

so I've gone back over it probably three

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:09.960 
so I've gone back over it probably three
times<00:07:07.240> or<00:07:07.539> so<00:07:07.720> and<00:07:08.680> it's<00:07:08.919> starting<00:07:09.400> to<00:07:09.550> look<00:07:09.759> a

00:07:09.960 --> 00:07:09.970 
times or so and it's starting to look a

00:07:09.970 --> 00:07:12.240 
times or so and it's starting to look a
little<00:07:10.360> too<00:07:10.750> much<00:07:10.990> for<00:07:11.319> my<00:07:11.500> taste<00:07:11.860> so<00:07:12.069> I'm

00:07:12.240 --> 00:07:12.250 
little too much for my taste so I'm
