00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.960
 hi youtube people this example that does not 

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:09.389
 the day finally arrived today 

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:11.550
 launched battlefield 4 we are seeing the 

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:13.920
 version of playstation 3 this game 

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:16.320
 It is also available for Xbox 360 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:18.119
 pc and later with the release of 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:21.000
 the new generation of consoles will come out 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:22.980
 for playstation 4 and the box one what 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.630
 we are seeing right now is the field 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:26.760
 of tests I still wanted to enter the 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:29.070
 online or there are people or they are not the 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:31.679
 available servers and if they put me one 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:34.110
 game gets me with nobody or I'm 

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:36.239
 playing alone and what we are going to schedule 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:38.309
 is the testing ground just what is 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:40.110
 a kind of island that we will go 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:41.520
 traveling and getting different things 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:43.680
 of what can be done let's say at all 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:45.329
 the environment of the battle fil multiplayer 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:47.789
 For example, traveling the islands with 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:50.730
 boats also makes sense are the 

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:52.739
 airplanes among other things and good here 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:54.840
 we have some enemies some whites 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:56.129
 to shoot them and well I'll comment 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:57.809
 a little bit about the first 

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:59.789
 impressions what I played I played a single 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:01.680
 mission of the campaign and really 

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:03.270
 listening to other reviews and other 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:05.100
 impressions of today because 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:06.050
 many people have it before obviously the 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:07.880
 game 

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:10.060
 all the big chains like machinima 

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:12.710
 ign entering the art etcetera etcetera 

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:15.260
 they came out many but many let's say 

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:17.840
 reviews analysis there are reports of this 

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:20.450
 game and so I was listening to the 

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:22.880
 game does not go down 89 social point the 

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:25.670
 game is pretty good what more 

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:28.040
 disappointed for the people is the way 

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:30.740
 campaign because because the campaign mode in 

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:32.780
 the battlefield was always a lot 

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:34.880
 has action, that is, there are not very 

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:37.190
 memorable compared to campaigns 

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:40.340
 of other games like call of duty that 

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:41.450
 just his rival archga recontra is 

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:42.830
 right here details is more for the 

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:44.360
 multiple there are 11 there since 

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:46.910
 we turn on the game since we started 

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:49.340
 to play the first way to stand out is the 

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:51.800
 multiplayer because it's like that and battlefield 

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:53.960
 is characterized by the most multiplayer 

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:55.820
 that for the campaign to see I will try to 

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:58.100
 put a boat aquatic vehicles me 

00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:59.860
 I'm going to annul the cheetah so we can 

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:03.490
 move along 

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:06.820
 and really graphically watching 

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:08.740
 comparatives the playstation 4 version 

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:10.929
 and the xbox one of course are the 

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:12.880
 better but especially the version of 

00:02:10.929 --> 00:02:15.400
 xbox one and it really surprised me two 

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:17.590
 thinking that a couple of days ago I heard 

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:19.300
 that the version of the call of duty goes 

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:21.940
 was going to look much better in the version of 

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:24.970
 playstation 4 because it runs at 1080p and the 

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:26.800
 of box one in 720 p the truth that is 

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:28.870
 something that surprises alone because everyone 

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:30.250
 we know that the call of duty was played 

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:32.260
 better in xbox since it has the 

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:34.990
 exclusivity do in the first maps 

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:36.220
 among other things and the truth that is 

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:38.170
 something that catches the attention that a 

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:40.570
 version of Call of Duty is a little 

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:42.430
 lower in xbox one but that the 

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:45.220
 battlefield look better in that console 

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:46.600
 it's kind of weird I know and well we're 

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:49.390
 going through this list really 

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:51.520
 graphically on playstation3 it looks good 

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:54.160
 it's not that it's bad or we're not going to 

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:55.900
 buy to criticize graphically that 

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:58.120
 already in playstation 4 is going to see better 

00:02:55.900 --> 00:03:00.130
 obviously that as the anteroom of the 

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:02.650
 new generation of consoles as see 

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:05.950
 that we can destroy everything for example 

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:07.239
 it's a pretty interesting aspect about 

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:08.920
 all the battlefield really this my 

00:03:07.239 --> 00:03:10.569
 first battlefield those who know the 

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:14.409
 channel know that I like the call of 

00:03:10.569 --> 00:03:16.840
 duty and we are testing this field of 

00:03:14.409 --> 00:03:18.280
 tests as you see the graphs of some 

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:20.230
 commissioning tables that I saw too 

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:22.120
 some reviews that the version of 

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:25.780
 playstation 3 and of you in trying to 

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:27.819
 order some textures and really 

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:29.950
 that is if the first time you go to 

00:03:27.819 --> 00:03:31.750
 buy a battle feel and you're seeing in 

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:33.069
 what version to buy them and share 

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:36.129
 now I will wait for the new generation 

00:03:33.069 --> 00:03:39.010
 of consoles I would say that you try it on 

00:03:36.129 --> 00:03:40.989
 playstation 3 or in fish and 3 one die 

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:44.109
 but good though if you know that you 

00:03:40.989 --> 00:03:46.599
 they run me the games of now neither you 

00:03:44.109 --> 00:03:48.430
 I say buy you a super powerful pc for 

00:03:46.599 --> 00:03:51.129
 play it but mostly to run 

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:53.799
 in 60 frames in what I think that holds 

00:03:51.129 --> 00:03:55.510
 this game always battlefield had low 

00:03:53.799 --> 00:03:58.060
 of frames for example in addition to fil 3 and 

00:03:55.510 --> 00:04:01.389
 in the bad company there was not 60 

00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:04.090
 frames so you know that aspect 

00:04:01.389 --> 00:04:07.480
 with the duty was let's say the look 

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:08.799
 superior but lately people have 

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:09.850
 like the battlefield more because it is a 

00:04:08.799 --> 00:04:11.890
 game 

00:04:09.850 --> 00:04:14.950
 I do not know if with more emotion or adrenaline 

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:18.400
 but I do not know if we arrived with more quality 

00:04:14.950 --> 00:04:20.380
 the total game but from what I see 

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:22.900
 rebate the end 4 will be bad campaign of 

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:25.120
 multiplayer and in the collectives are going to 

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:27.640
 come other modes like the squats mode and 

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:29.920
 extinction mode but you say 4 play 

00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:31.660
 Multiple multiple multiplayer mode and 

00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:34.390
 until you get tired you go a little 

00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:36.220
 campaign and then you go back to playing the 

00:04:34.390 --> 00:04:38.500
 multiple with your friends what more 

00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:41.590
 he highlighted this game as let's say novelty 

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:43.630
 is the theme of being able to play with a tablet 

00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:45.150
 giving orders to your colleagues that I 

00:04:43.630 --> 00:04:48.580
 it seemed very good you can also throw 

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:52.180
 predator missiles if you want from your 

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:53.620
 tablet or directly an application that 

00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:55.390
 I think it's called I do not know if it's battlelog 

00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:57.100
 or the application has another name but 

00:04:55.390 --> 00:04:59.380
 bat in what is where we can see 

00:04:57.100 --> 00:05:00.400
 all our statistics our 

00:04:59.380 --> 00:05:02.890
 progress with weapons and so on 

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:04.780
 etcetera and well then try to destroy 

00:05:02.890 --> 00:05:06.880
 this tank is possible obviously that 

00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:08.680
 the bullets will not do anything like 

00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:10.360
 this has been a bit of the 

00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:11.740
 battlefield 4 surely in the 

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:13.780
 next days they will be bringing you is 

00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:15.340
 some multiplayer gameplay still 

00:05:13.780 --> 00:05:16.569
 is not available for immediately 

00:05:15.340 --> 00:05:18.879
 I'm going to play a little 

00:05:16.569 --> 00:05:20.589
 to see what wave and tomorrow I will 

00:05:18.879 --> 00:05:22.330

 this announcement the extinction mode the
