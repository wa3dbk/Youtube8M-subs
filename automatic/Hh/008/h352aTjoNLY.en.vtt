00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 
each one of the divider legs and you'll

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:02.330 
each one of the divider legs and you'll
get<00:00:59.250> those<00:00:59.430> points<00:01:00.860> and<00:01:01.860> I've<00:01:02.010> heard<00:01:02.190> a<00:01:02.220> story

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
that they used to use frog intestines

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:05.720

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:11.420 
in rural tides and the crushing one frog
intestine<00:01:08.850> was<00:01:08.910> long<00:01:09.120> enough<00:01:09.330> to<00:01:10.160> snap<00:01:11.160> like<00:01:11.340> a

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
intestine was long enough to snap like a

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:13.490 
intestine was long enough to snap like a
railroad<00:01:11.670> tie<00:01:11.850> which<00:01:12.060> is<00:01:12.210> what<00:01:12.500> sir

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500 
railroad tie which is what sir

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
geographical center and the easiest ways

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:18.200 
geographical center and the easiest ways
to<00:01:16.800> stretch<00:01:17.010> a<00:01:17.040> chalk<00:01:17.310> line<00:01:17.340> out<00:01:17.640> on<00:01:17.820> top<00:01:18.000> I

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
to stretch a chalk line out on top I

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:19.719 
to stretch a chalk line out on top I
need<00:01:18.390> a<00:01:18.420> volunteer<00:01:18.660> from<00:01:18.990> the<00:01:19.140> audience<00:01:19.200> here

00:01:19.719 --> 00:01:19.729

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
wrap around your finger once so what

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:31.999 
wrap around your finger once so what
we're<00:01:30.360> gonna<00:01:30.420> do<00:01:30.630> is<00:01:30.900> just<00:01:31.140> sort<00:01:31.259> of<00:01:31.380> lay<00:01:31.830> this

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:32.009 
we're gonna do is just sort of lay this

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:41.749 
we're gonna do is just sort of lay this
over<00:01:32.190> the<00:01:32.400> log<00:01:38.390> oh<00:01:40.070> all<00:01:41.070> right<00:01:41.190> so<00:01:41.400> all<00:01:41.550> of<00:01:41.729> what

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:41.759 
over the log oh all right so all of what

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:43.190 
over the log oh all right so all of what
you<00:01:42.000> think<00:01:42.240> is<00:01:42.330> the<00:01:42.450> center<00:01:42.720> line<00:01:42.750> in<00:01:42.960> the<00:01:43.020> log

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
you think is the center line in the log

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:45.200 
you think is the center line in the log
and<00:01:43.830> slightly<00:01:44.130> above<00:01:44.340> the<00:01:44.580> surface<00:01:44.790> and<00:01:45.150> get

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210 
and slightly above the surface and get

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:48.320 
and slightly above the surface and get
your<00:01:45.390> fingers<00:01:45.750> right<00:01:45.900> in<00:01:46.050> that<00:01:46.170> step<00:01:47.150> you<00:01:48.150> lift

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:48.330 
your fingers right in that step you lift

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:51.340 
your fingers right in that step you lift
it<00:01:48.450> up<00:01:48.479> a<00:01:48.600> little<00:01:48.660> bit<00:01:48.840> though

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:51.350 

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:53.600 

so<00:01:52.350> what<00:01:52.650> we<00:01:52.740> want<00:01:52.920> to<00:01:52.979> do<00:01:53.040> is<00:01:53.160> move<00:01:53.280> it<00:01:53.430> back

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:53.610 
so what we want to do is move it back

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:55.670 
so what we want to do is move it back
and<00:01:53.790> forth<00:01:54.060> one<00:01:54.810> end<00:01:54.990> to<00:01:55.020> the<00:01:55.080> other<00:01:55.200> so<00:01:55.350> we<00:01:55.560> get

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:55.680 
and forth one end to the other so we get

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:59.859 
and forth one end to the other so we get
kind<00:01:55.800> of<00:01:55.890> a<00:01:55.950> geographical<00:01:56.550> center<00:01:57.440> and<00:01:58.550> I

00:01:59.859 --> 00:01:59.869 
kind of a geographical center and I

00:01:59.869 --> 00:02:07.960 
kind of a geographical center and I
think<00:02:00.869> we're<00:02:00.990> good<00:02:01.140> right<00:02:01.259> about<00:02:01.380> there

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:07.970

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:15.060 
huh I'm just gonna snap this line it's

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:16.400 
huh I'm just gonna snap this line it's

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:54.090 
we're really close together to cut the

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:57.170 
we're really close together to cut the
green<00:02:54.239> uh<00:02:55.100> yeah<00:02:56.100> that<00:02:56.280> would<00:02:56.370> be<00:02:56.400> it<00:02:56.730> would<00:02:57.150> be

00:02:57.170 --> 00:02:57.180 
green uh yeah that would be it would be

00:02:57.180 --> 00:02:59.570 
green uh yeah that would be it would be
helpful<00:02:57.600> with<00:02:57.720> uh<00:02:57.980> we<00:02:58.980> juggle<00:02:59.250> closer

00:02:59.570 --> 00:02:59.580 
helpful with uh we juggle closer

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:03.320 
helpful with uh we juggle closer
together<00:03:00.620> it's<00:03:01.620> almost<00:03:01.769> like<00:03:02.040> not<00:03:02.160> juggling<00:03:02.459> I

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:03.330 
together it's almost like not juggling I

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:05.420 
together it's almost like not juggling I
mean<00:03:04.319> I<00:03:04.410> suppose<00:03:04.470> are<00:03:04.799> basically<00:03:05.040> fallen

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:05.430 
mean I suppose are basically fallen

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:08.120 
mean I suppose are basically fallen
parallel<00:03:05.880> or<00:03:06.150> slightly<00:03:06.510> coming<00:03:06.870> out<00:03:07.040> by<00:03:08.040> the

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:08.130 
parallel or slightly coming out by the

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:11.090 
parallel or slightly coming out by the
way<00:03:08.220> you<00:03:08.280> score<00:03:08.730> up<00:03:08.910> the<00:03:09.060> tree<00:03:10.100> pointing

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:11.100 
way you score up the tree pointing

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:13.819 
way you score up the tree pointing
towards<00:03:11.340> the<00:03:11.400> bottom<00:03:12.049> an<00:03:13.049> idea<00:03:13.590> you've

00:03:13.819 --> 00:03:13.829 
towards the bottom an idea you've

00:03:13.829 --> 00:03:16.940 
towards the bottom an idea you've
brought<00:03:14.040> X<00:03:14.280> down<00:03:14.519> the<00:03:14.730> tree<00:03:15.620> you<00:03:16.620> can't<00:03:16.799> always

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:16.950 
brought X down the tree you can't always

00:03:16.950 --> 00:04:02.629 
brought X down the tree you can't always
do<00:03:17.190> that<00:03:17.340> back<00:03:17.690> straight

00:04:02.629 --> 00:04:02.639 

00:04:02.639 --> 00:04:06.479 

big<00:04:03.639> not<00:04:03.819> down<00:04:04.090> there<00:04:04.329> yeah<00:04:04.900> so<00:04:05.859> sometimes<00:04:06.280> you

00:04:06.479 --> 00:04:06.489 
big not down there yeah so sometimes you

00:04:06.489 --> 00:04:08.970 
big not down there yeah so sometimes you
you<00:04:06.790> go<00:04:06.909> bite<00:04:07.120> beyond<00:04:07.480> it<00:04:07.690> and<00:04:07.930> kind<00:04:08.769> of<00:04:08.799> come

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:08.980 
you go bite beyond it and kind of come

00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:11.399 
you go bite beyond it and kind of come
back<00:04:09.129> this<00:04:09.280> way<00:04:09.459> because<00:04:09.639> the<00:04:09.849> grain<00:04:10.090> can<00:04:10.409> can

00:04:11.399 --> 00:04:11.409 
back this way because the grain can can

00:04:11.409 --> 00:04:12.809 
back this way because the grain can can
do<00:04:11.530> that<00:04:11.739> where<00:04:11.980> it<00:04:12.040> comes<00:04:12.190> up<00:04:12.280> into<00:04:12.519> a<00:04:12.549> branch

00:04:12.809 --> 00:04:12.819 
do that where it comes up into a branch

00:04:12.819 --> 00:04:16.319 
do that where it comes up into a branch
and<00:04:13.150> then<00:04:13.599> we<00:04:13.780> go<00:04:14.019> gene<00:04:14.319> go<00:04:14.349> Jen<00:04:15.069> yeah<00:04:15.329> of

00:04:16.319 --> 00:04:16.329 
and then we go gene go Jen yeah of

00:04:16.329 --> 00:04:24.740 
and then we go gene go Jen yeah of
course<00:04:16.539> I<00:04:16.600> got<00:04:16.720> this<00:04:16.840> knot<00:04:17.049> here<00:04:17.289> now<00:04:17.410> yeah

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:24.750 

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:44.850 

that<00:04:25.750> was<00:04:25.900> less<00:04:26.050> of<00:04:26.080> a<00:04:26.260> problem<00:04:43.650> this<00:04:44.650> was<00:04:44.830> a

00:04:44.850 --> 00:04:44.860 
that was less of a problem this was a

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:56.360 
that was less of a problem this was a
dead<00:04:45.130> not<00:04:45.310> up<00:04:45.490> here<00:04:45.610> that<00:04:45.789> was<00:04:45.910> still<00:04:46.210> alive

00:04:56.360 --> 00:04:56.370 

00:04:56.370 --> 00:04:57.950 

so<00:04:56.880> once<00:04:57.030> you<00:04:57.090> get<00:04:57.180> overtime<00:04:57.540> out<00:04:57.780> of<00:04:57.870> these

00:04:57.950 --> 00:04:57.960 
so once you get overtime out of these

00:04:57.960 --> 00:05:00.290 
so once you get overtime out of these
sort<00:04:58.200> of<00:04:58.670> troughs<00:04:59.670> that<00:04:59.820> are<00:04:59.910> running<00:05:00.030> at<00:05:00.180> an

00:05:00.290 --> 00:05:00.300 
sort of troughs that are running at an

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:02.840 
sort of troughs that are running at an
angle<00:05:00.630> up<00:05:00.960> the<00:05:01.110> surface<00:05:01.670> depending<00:05:02.670> on<00:05:02.760> how

00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:02.850 
angle up the surface depending on how

00:05:02.850 --> 00:05:13.430 
angle up the surface depending on how
much<00:05:03.740> curve<00:05:04.740> there<00:05:04.920> is<00:05:04.980> on<00:05:05.130> your<00:05:05.250> ass

00:05:13.430 --> 00:05:13.440 

00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:15.500
