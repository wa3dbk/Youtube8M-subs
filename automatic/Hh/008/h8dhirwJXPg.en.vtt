 how is this called 

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:53.020
 until I can dimensions 

00:00:53.450 --> 00:01:00.380
 as we can see is for greater 17 because 

00:00:56.540 --> 00:01:04.710
 there is a lot of sexual content and violence 

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:07.650

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:24.370
 is for the xbox playstation 3 and the 

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:24.370
 truth is that for the wii I have no idea 

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:32.649
 it broke a bit when I tried to 

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:34.420
 open what was quite enough but 

00:01:32.649 --> 00:01:37.310
 well I guess what I want to see if I put 

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:38.800
 they want to see s 

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:41.110

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:45.450
 that game inside and everything it brings 

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:45.450
 not for that we will live 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:52.850
 is the game very nice 

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:56.680
 and here is super 

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:04.850
 those types of 

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:09.790
 of games here brings 2 

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:09.790
 3 and 4 

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:14.940

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:23.100
 available now here is in spanish 

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:24.810

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:28.450
 principle 3 

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:29.900
 you playstation network 

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:35.990
 and 

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:39.970
 there is more vulgar language then 

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:45.390
 so let's see what is 

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:45.390
 because for that information guarantee 

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:50.239
 things let's continue here what is this 

00:02:54.660 --> 00:03:01.470
 share buy help I believe the truth 

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:04.160
 is that a game because he just went to 

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:04.160

 and I also have the one but the one is 

00:03:06.799 --> 00:03:12.439
 separately this does not read a boxing 

00:03:09.439 --> 00:03:15.210
 because I already saw it and I already have the papers 

00:03:12.439 --> 00:03:17.250
 It is by sounding everywhere 

00:03:15.210 --> 00:03:20.010
 and well this is more good this what 

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:24.500
 bring what brings this up 

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:24.500
 Let's leave it 

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:33.060
 to see that these are the password the 

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:35.849
 truth is that this I have no idea for 

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:38.810
 but what good I'll find out and it 

00:03:35.849 --> 00:03:38.810
 I'll say in another video 

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:46.180
 to make them in zeros I have no idea 

00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:49.460
 because it's a time when they 're around 

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:51.710
 I had to be English 

00:03:49.460 --> 00:03:55.790

00:04:08.950 --> 00:04:12.150
 I think it's worth a lot 

00:04:12.460 --> 00:04:21.870
