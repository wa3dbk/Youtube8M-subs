00:00:02.450 --> 00:00:23.930
 prepared the golden tacos in style 

00:00:05.059 --> 00:00:27.200
 sinaloa we are going to occupy half a kilo of 

00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:30.020
 meat is back or meat to reserve 

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:32.119
 this meat is already cooked and also 

00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:34.750
 we are going to occupy the position in which 

00:00:32.119 --> 00:00:37.430
 We met the meat three boiled potatoes 

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:40.160
 our potatoes lazcoz and together with the 

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:42.860
 meat we are going to occupy tortillas for 

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:45.320
 tacos these ribs are very many 

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:47.270
 cookies are not the same as tortillas 

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:51.530
 that we do not commonly use to 

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:54.260
 eat and well these tortillas are very 

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:56.930
 very thin almost in almost 

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:58.880
 transparent since they are already when we 

00:00:56.930 --> 00:01:02.180
 we come out see how this is done 

00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:04.519
 excellent to form the taquitos 

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:08.950
 and we are going to occupy some vegetables here 

00:01:04.519 --> 00:01:12.800
 I have tomato this is that it came and applied 

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:15.740
 grated carrot here I have a little bit of 

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:17.600
 onion tanned if you do not know how 

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:19.700
 cut the onion in my channel there is a 

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:22.640
 video where I show how to cut the 

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:25.130
 Onion easy and fast we also take 

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:27.440
 a bit of chopped lettuce I already have 

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:29.450
 all the chopped vegetables because not 

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:31.729
 you thought about the video but at the last minute 

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:34.790
 I decided to record them and that's why I have 

00:01:31.729 --> 00:01:37.700
 all this advanced here I have that 

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:40.190
 this is grated cheese that is a rancher 

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:42.080
 but it could be that it was with you or 

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:44.420
 any cheese that you like 

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:47.300
 that can be bathed I have a bit of 

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:50.300
 cream also here I have the macaw 

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:52.490
 that can not miss and raised the 

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:54.649
 contributor but if you do not have 

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:56.090
 I can put is before it 

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:57.740
 send we check that it is but not 

00:01:56.090 --> 00:02:00.920
 I found no one then I will not have 

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:02.350
 to conform and do it without avocado what 

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:04.220
 first thing we're going to do 

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:06.920
 the meat 

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:09.740
 I'm going to grind the potatoes with a grinder 

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:11.490
 beans or you can also grind it with a 

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:13.890
 fork 

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:18.690
 to repair the caldillo for the tacos 

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:23.010
 golden nothing else we are going to occupy a puree 

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:26.010
 a handful of oregano and the broth in the 

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:29.240
 that I cook the meat in a case I'm going to 

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:29.240
 put a little oil 

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:35.570
 I will put fire and when hot 

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:36.650
 we're going to put the puree a bit 

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:39.790
 the oil was a little hot 

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:39.790
 we put the puree 

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:50.200
 let's stir about two 

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:50.200
 minutes we are going to put the broth 

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:56.950
 Now let's put a little fist 

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:58.390
 oregano here add it to taste 

00:02:56.950 --> 00:03:00.790
 I'm going to drink the oregano and I'm going to 

00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:02.590
 crush with your hands to expose it 

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:04.330
 because if they have the leaves as very 

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:06.250
 whole 

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:08.410
 then nothing else is a matter of 

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:08.860
 crush a little bit like that with our 

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:12.700
 fingers 

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:14.200
 that's like not waiting for it to boil and 

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:17.140
 let's leave what takes about three 

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:19.600
 minutes and will be ready as 

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:21.970
 we have the potato molina 

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:25.630
 we have the shredded meat we are going to 

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:28.510
 mix the meat with the potato I do not know 

00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:30.910
 I'm going to put all this is more for what 

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:33.010
 Take me a little meat I did 

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:35.140
 half a kilo but I will use very 

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:38.530
 little bit and I'll save the rest for 

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:40.870
 make another meal the golden tacos do not 

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:43.930
 they have so much meat they carry very little 

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:48.280
 meat and take more potatoes we are going to mix 

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:49.930
 to integrate the meat with the potato here 

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:52.410
 it is already you decide if you want 

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:55.450
 put a lot of meat because you know a lot 

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:58.060
 but there is no need with a little bit of 

00:03:55.450 --> 00:04:02.480
 meat are already rich are golden tacos 

00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:05.239
 of potatoes are not golden tacos of meat 

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:07.879
 it is not necessary to put many things to 

00:04:05.239 --> 00:04:09.680
 can enter a meat also but 

00:04:07.879 --> 00:04:12.230
 well I tried it and it made me 

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:14.239
 there was a little bit missing if you 

00:04:12.230 --> 00:04:16.669
 they think that they lack him and if not 

00:04:14.239 --> 00:04:18.949
 there is no need to with it is already 

00:04:16.669 --> 00:04:21.949
 ready the potato with the meat now let's 

00:04:18.949 --> 00:04:24.500
 form the tacos use the tortillas in 

00:04:21.949 --> 00:04:26.479
 a plastic bag and I put it 30 

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:28.760
 seconds to the microwave so that 

00:04:26.479 --> 00:04:30.800
 softened a little and not break the 

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:33.289
 time to do the work 

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:35.810
 let's put a little bit of the potato with 

00:04:33.289 --> 00:04:38.539
 the meat this is very little there is no 

00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:40.250
 need to put a lot of dad 

00:04:38.539 --> 00:04:42.500
 these account that nothing else 

00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:45.740
 they seized the potato with the meat is the 

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:48.710
 tortilla and you're going to make the garlic 

00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:51.199
 now we 're going to take it to the pan here 

00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:53.830
 I already have the hot oil and we 

00:04:51.199 --> 00:04:53.830
 let's laugh 

00:04:55.280 --> 00:04:59.960
 the tacos that are already golden 

00:04:57.170 --> 00:05:02.540
 We drain them, we take them out, we put them in a 

00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:06.009
 dish with absorbent paper so that 

00:05:02.540 --> 00:05:08.259
 I shielded excess fat 

00:05:06.009 --> 00:05:10.389
 we can also get on top of a 

00:05:08.259 --> 00:05:12.909
 strainer to drain on the farm 

00:05:10.389 --> 00:05:15.669
 down as you seek 

00:05:12.909 --> 00:05:18.789
 how to remove excess oil 

00:05:15.669 --> 00:05:21.610
 the tacos can be like that with a colander 

00:05:18.789 --> 00:05:23.980
 or they can also be putting them up 

00:05:21.610 --> 00:05:26.590
 of an absorbent paper 

00:05:23.980 --> 00:05:29.040
 Now I'm going to help us see how 

00:05:26.590 --> 00:05:29.040
 we serve them 

00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:34.000
 I'm going to put some lettuce 

00:05:35.639 --> 00:05:39.719
 little carrot here is to the liking of 

00:05:38.189 --> 00:05:42.260
 the amounts all that you 

00:05:39.719 --> 00:05:44.810
 want to put you 

00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:48.640
 a little cucumber we are missing the avocado 

00:05:44.810 --> 00:05:48.640
 but if you have it, they put it on 

00:05:50.420 --> 00:05:55.470
 mate 

00:05:52.740 --> 00:06:04.020

00:06:04.020 --> 00:06:07.710
 everyone can earn it with what 

00:06:06.450 --> 00:06:12.050

00:06:07.710 --> 00:06:12.050

00:06:15.380 --> 00:06:17.770
 the macaw 

00:06:18.400 --> 00:06:24.759
 and finally we put the cream to our 

00:06:21.250 --> 00:06:27.880
 taste and we serve it accompanied by a 

00:06:24.759 --> 00:06:29.860
