Jarrid from Luther performs here and

00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:07.309 
Jarrid from Luther performs here and
today<00:00:05.250> we<00:00:05.310> will<00:00:05.430> talk<00:00:05.490> about<00:00:05.670> fuel<00:00:06.120> systems<00:00:06.600> up

00:00:07.309 --> 00:00:07.319 
today we will talk about fuel systems up

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:09.890 
today we will talk about fuel systems up
until<00:00:07.620> now<00:00:07.770> for<00:00:08.459> the<00:00:09.120> most<00:00:09.330> part<00:00:09.570> the<00:00:09.690> best

00:00:09.890 --> 00:00:09.900 
until now for the most part the best

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:12.799 
until now for the most part the best
solution<00:00:10.320> has<00:00:10.410> been<00:00:10.440> for<00:00:10.770> 99204<00:00:11.610> Mustangs<00:00:12.119> -

00:00:12.799 --> 00:00:12.809 
solution has been for 99204 Mustangs -

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:15.199 
solution has been for 99204 Mustangs -
and<00:00:13.170> you<00:00:13.920> know<00:00:14.039> larger<00:00:14.400> fuel<00:00:14.609> capacity<00:00:14.789> would

00:00:15.199 --> 00:00:15.209 
and you know larger fuel capacity would

00:00:15.209 --> 00:00:16.640 
and you know larger fuel capacity would
be<00:00:15.270> adding<00:00:15.719> an<00:00:15.809> additional<00:00:16.139> pump<00:00:16.410> to<00:00:16.560> the

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:16.650 
be adding an additional pump to the

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:18.529 
be adding an additional pump to the
system<00:00:17.010> because<00:00:17.220> most<00:00:17.430> of<00:00:17.550> those<00:00:17.669> systems

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:18.539 
system because most of those systems

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:21.019 
system because most of those systems
were<00:00:18.839> a<00:00:18.900> single<00:00:19.230> pump<00:00:19.380> system<00:00:19.830> now<00:00:20.429> for<00:00:20.460> most

00:00:21.019 --> 00:00:21.029 
were a single pump system now for most

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:23.089 
were a single pump system now for most
rural<00:00:21.269> guys<00:00:21.570> did<00:00:21.900> was<00:00:22.109> they<00:00:22.650> will<00:00:22.800> put<00:00:22.980> an

00:00:23.089 --> 00:00:23.099 
rural guys did was they will put an

00:00:23.099 --> 00:00:24.769 
rural guys did was they will put an
