over here so that I have this space in

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:20.620 
over here so that I have this space in
here<00:01:19.640> and<00:01:19.850> I<00:01:19.880> have<00:01:20.060> this<00:01:20.180> little<00:01:20.330> triangle

here and I have this little triangle

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:25.210 
here and I have this little triangle
down<00:01:20.960> here<00:01:21.940> and<00:01:22.940> now<00:01:23.090> the<00:01:23.150> next<00:01:23.420> step<00:01:24.220> I'm

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:25.220 
down here and now the next step I'm

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:28.360 
down here and now the next step I'm
going<00:01:25.340> to<00:01:25.400> take<00:01:25.490> this<00:01:26.080> and<00:01:27.080> I'm<00:01:28.040> showing<00:01:28.250> I

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:28.370 
going to take this and I'm showing I

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:30.070 
going to take this and I'm showing I
need<00:01:28.820> to<00:01:28.880> kind<00:01:29.060> of<00:01:29.090> hold<00:01:29.270> this<00:01:29.420> in<00:01:29.600> place<00:01:29.630> but

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:30.080 
need to kind of hold this in place but

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:36.510 
need to kind of hold this in place but
I'm<00:01:30.170> going<00:01:30.290> to<00:01:30.320> bring<00:01:30.560> this<00:01:31.240> under<00:01:34.060> under<00:01:35.060> here

00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:36.520 
I'm going to bring this under under here

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:38.650 
I'm going to bring this under under here
and<00:01:37.520> kind<00:01:37.700> of<00:01:37.790> make<00:01:37.910> this<00:01:38.060> little<00:01:38.270> loop<00:01:38.630> right

00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:38.660 
and kind of make this little loop right

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:39.960 
and kind of make this little loop right
here

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:39.970 
here

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:42.400 
here
now<00:01:40.970> the<00:01:41.030> next<00:01:41.270> step<00:01:41.450> this<00:01:41.660> is<00:01:41.720> going<00:01:41.990> to<00:01:42.080> be

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:42.410 
now the next step this is going to be

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:44.170 
now the next step this is going to be
like<00:01:42.620> sort<00:01:42.800> of<00:01:42.920> my<00:01:43.010> working<00:01:43.460> end<00:01:43.670> if<00:01:43.880> you<00:01:44.000> will

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:44.180 
like sort of my working end if you will

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:46.300 
like sort of my working end if you will
I'm<00:01:44.960> going<00:01:45.080> to<00:01:45.200> take<00:01:45.410> this<00:01:45.590> so<00:01:45.800> here<00:01:46.040> I'm<00:01:46.190> going

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:46.310 
I'm going to take this so here I'm going

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:48.340 
I'm going to take this so here I'm going
to<00:01:46.400> pass<00:01:46.610> it<00:01:46.880> under<00:01:47.270> this<00:01:47.750> space<00:01:48.050> right<00:01:48.290> here

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:48.350 
to pass it under this space right here

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:52.720 
to pass it under this space right here
over<00:01:48.800> here<00:01:49.010> under<00:01:49.370> here<00:01:51.040> so<00:01:52.040> I'm<00:01:52.190> going<00:01:52.400> over

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:52.730 
over here under here so I'm going over

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:59.110 
over here under here so I'm going over
here<00:01:54.880> and<00:01:55.880> then<00:01:56.540> under<00:01:56.930> through<00:01:57.350> here<00:01:58.120> and

00:01:59.110 --> 00:01:59.120 
here and then under through here and

00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:00.310 
here and then under through here and
then<00:01:59.240> once<00:01:59.420> I<00:01:59.510> got<00:01:59.690> that<00:01:59.900> I'm<00:01:59.990> going<00:02:00.110> to<00:02:00.170> hold

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:00.320 
then once I got that I'm going to hold

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:01.660 
then once I got that I'm going to hold
this<00:02:00.470> and<00:02:00.680> sort<00:02:00.830> just<00:02:00.980> pull<00:02:01.250> this<00:02:01.370> tight<00:02:01.640> a

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:01.670 
this and sort just pull this tight a

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:04.300 
this and sort just pull this tight a
little<00:02:01.790> bit<00:02:02.260> sort<00:02:03.260> of<00:02:03.350> clean<00:02:03.830> this<00:02:03.950> up<00:02:04.100> on

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:04.310 
little bit sort of clean this up on

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:06.250 
little bit sort of clean this up on
itself<00:02:04.580> and<00:02:05.450> basically<00:02:05.960> you're<00:02:06.110> going<00:02:06.200> to

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:06.260 
itself and basically you're going to

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:07.090 
itself and basically you're going to
have<00:02:06.320> something<00:02:06.560> that's<00:02:06.740> going<00:02:06.890> to<00:02:06.980> look<00:02:07.070> like

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:07.100 
have something that's going to look like

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:08.440 
have something that's going to look like
that<00:02:07.370> and<00:02:07.610> it's<00:02:07.760> this<00:02:08.090> is<00:02:08.239> just<00:02:08.390> a

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:08.450 
that and it's this is just a

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:10.449 
that and it's this is just a
weird-looking<00:02:09.050> thing<00:02:09.080> put<00:02:09.979> knots<00:02:10.250> and

00:02:10.449 --> 00:02:10.459 
weird-looking thing put knots and

00:02:10.459 --> 00:02:12.100 
weird-looking thing put knots and
hitches<00:02:10.759> go<00:02:10.940> this<00:02:11.180> is<00:02:11.330> kind<00:02:11.510> of<00:02:11.569> cool<00:02:11.750> kind<00:02:11.990> of

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:12.110 
hitches go this is kind of cool kind of

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:14.920 
hitches go this is kind of cool kind of
different<00:02:13.390> but<00:02:14.390> basically<00:02:14.510> you<00:02:14.780> want

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:14.930 
different but basically you want

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:16.500 
different but basically you want
something<00:02:15.140> is<00:02:15.200> going<00:02:15.290> to<00:02:15.380> look<00:02:15.500> like<00:02:15.650> this

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:16.510 
something is going to look like this

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:18.479 
something is going to look like this
and<00:02:16.659> now<00:02:17.050> the<00:02:17.110> last<00:02:17.440> and<00:02:17.709> final<00:02:18.099> step<00:02:18.129> I'm

00:02:18.479 --> 00:02:18.489 
and now the last and final step I'm

00:02:18.489 --> 00:02:20.280 
and now the last and final step I'm
going<00:02:18.640> to<00:02:18.730> take<00:02:18.940> this<00:02:19.239> that's<00:02:19.810> running<00:02:20.050> behind

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:20.290 
going to take this that's running behind

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:22.740 
going to take this that's running behind
this<00:02:20.739> loop<00:02:20.980> right<00:02:21.010> here<00:02:21.220> I'm<00:02:22.150> going<00:02:22.299> to<00:02:22.390> pull

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:22.750 
this loop right here I'm going to pull

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:26.729 
this loop right here I'm going to pull
this<00:02:22.900> under<00:02:24.540> everything<00:02:25.540> that<00:02:25.659> I've<00:02:25.780> done<00:02:25.810> and

00:02:26.729 --> 00:02:26.739 
this under everything that I've done and

00:02:26.739 --> 00:02:28.140 
this under everything that I've done and
hold<00:02:27.040> this<00:02:27.190> with<00:02:27.340> my<00:02:27.459> left<00:02:27.610> hand<00:02:27.790> I'm<00:02:28.000> holding

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:28.150 
hold this with my left hand I'm holding

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:30.869 
hold this with my left hand I'm holding
it<00:02:28.420> and<00:02:28.569> then<00:02:28.720> this<00:02:28.930> other<00:02:29.140> piece<00:02:29.470> up<00:02:29.680> here<00:02:29.879> I'm

00:02:30.869 --> 00:02:30.879 
it and then this other piece up here I'm

00:02:30.879 --> 00:02:32.190 
it and then this other piece up here I'm
going<00:02:31.030> to<00:02:31.090> take<00:02:31.239> that<00:02:31.450> and<00:02:31.629> have<00:02:31.720> it<00:02:31.780> marry

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:32.200 
going to take that and have it marry

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:34.740 
going to take that and have it marry
come<00:02:32.620> meet<00:02:32.890> this<00:02:33.069> over<00:02:33.430> here<00:02:33.819> I'm<00:02:34.510> going<00:02:34.690> to

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:34.750 
come meet this over here I'm going to

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:36.240 
come meet this over here I'm going to
pinch<00:02:34.959> these<00:02:35.140> together<00:02:35.349> and<00:02:35.739> then<00:02:35.830> open<00:02:36.129> this

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:36.250 
pinch these together and then open this

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:41.070 
pinch these together and then open this
middle<00:02:36.610> up<00:02:38.220> and<00:02:39.660> then<00:02:40.660> you<00:02:40.720> have<00:02:40.750> something

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:41.080 
middle up and then you have something

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:45.600 
middle up and then you have something
that<00:02:41.290> looks<00:02:41.410> like<00:02:41.530> that<00:02:44.370> I'm<00:02:45.370> going<00:02:45.459> to<00:02:45.519> do

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:45.610 
that looks like that I'm going to do

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:47.130 
that looks like that I'm going to do
this<00:02:45.670> one<00:02:45.940> more<00:02:46.090> time<00:02:46.150> before<00:02:46.510> I<00:02:46.720> get<00:02:46.930> it<00:02:47.019> on

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:47.140 
this one more time before I get it on

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:48.210 
this one more time before I get it on
the<00:02:47.260> bottle<00:02:47.560> because<00:02:47.650> this<00:02:47.860> is<00:02:47.980> kind<00:02:48.159> of

00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:48.220 
the bottle because this is kind of

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:50.580 
the bottle because this is kind of
confusing<00:02:48.690> you<00:02:49.690> might<00:02:49.840> need<00:02:49.959> to<00:02:50.049> restart<00:02:50.410> it<00:02:50.530> a

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:50.590 
confusing you might need to restart it a

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:54.800 
confusing you might need to restart it a
few<00:02:50.769> times<00:02:51.329> took<00:02:52.329> me<00:02:52.480> a<00:02:52.540> little<00:02:52.599> bit<00:02:52.750> to<00:02:52.989> get<00:02:53.110> it

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:54.810 
few times took me a little bit to get it

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:57.000 
few times took me a little bit to get it
there's<00:02:55.810> one<00:02:55.870> more<00:02:56.079> time<00:02:56.319> then<00:02:56.560> I'll<00:02:56.680> put<00:02:56.950> it

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:57.010 
there's one more time then I'll put it

00:02:57.010 --> 00:03:02.030 
there's one more time then I'll put it
on<00:02:57.040> the<00:02:57.160> bottle

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:02.040 

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:05.149

00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:10.360 
underneath this piece pulled under

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:15.899 
underneath this piece pulled under
itself<00:04:10.750> and<00:04:11.079> the<00:04:11.439> top<00:04:13.680> and<00:04:14.680> have<00:04:15.310> those<00:04:15.459> Pink's

00:04:15.899 --> 00:04:15.909 
itself and the top and have those Pink's

00:04:15.909 --> 00:04:19.229 
itself and the top and have those Pink's
in<00:04:16.060> between<00:04:16.419> here<00:04:16.780> and<00:04:17.729> then<00:04:18.729> once<00:04:18.940> you<00:04:19.060> once

00:04:19.229 --> 00:04:19.239 
in between here and then once you once

00:04:19.239 --> 00:04:20.640 
in between here and then once you once
you<00:04:19.299> pinch<00:04:19.539> in<00:04:19.690> open<00:04:19.930> this<00:04:20.079> up<00:04:20.229> and<00:04:20.440> you<00:04:20.500> have

00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:20.650 
you pinch in open this up and you have

00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:22.050 
you pinch in open this up and you have
this<00:04:20.769> little<00:04:20.949> loop<00:04:21.220> that's<00:04:21.400> formed<00:04:21.760> or<00:04:21.940> this

00:04:22.050 --> 00:04:22.060 
this little loop that's formed or this

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:26.520 
this little loop that's formed or this
hole<00:04:22.800> now<00:04:23.800> once<00:04:23.949> we<00:04:24.010> got<00:04:24.100> that<00:04:25.139> you<00:04:26.139> can<00:04:26.289> did<00:04:26.500> a

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:26.530 
hole now once we got that you can did a

00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:29.370 
hole now once we got that you can did a
bottle<00:04:26.889> and<00:04:27.010> this<00:04:27.100> works<00:04:27.370> this<00:04:27.940> method<00:04:28.510> for

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:29.380 
bottle and this works this method for

00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:31.830 
bottle and this works this method for
carrying<00:04:29.770> a<00:04:29.949> bottle<00:04:30.430> container<00:04:30.940> works<00:04:31.630> really

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:31.840 
carrying a bottle container works really

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:33.990 
carrying a bottle container works really
well<00:04:32.110> for<00:04:32.169> something<00:04:32.860> that<00:04:33.010> has<00:04:33.190> a<00:04:33.220> rim<00:04:33.729> or<00:04:33.970> a

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:34.000 
well for something that has a rim or a

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:36.450 
well for something that has a rim or a
lip<00:04:34.300> and<00:04:34.960> on<00:04:35.320> this<00:04:35.440> particular<00:04:35.620> Nalgene

00:04:36.450 --> 00:04:36.460 
lip and on this particular Nalgene

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:38.250 
lip and on this particular Nalgene
there's<00:04:36.970> a<00:04:37.030> lip<00:04:37.300> there's<00:04:37.660> a<00:04:37.720> lip<00:04:37.990> right<00:04:38.199> here

00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:38.260 
there's a lip there's a lip right here

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:39.900 
there's a lip there's a lip right here
or<00:04:38.620> a<00:04:38.740> rim<00:04:38.979> if<00:04:39.100> you<00:04:39.160> want<00:04:39.310> to<00:04:39.370> call<00:04:39.520> coming<00:04:39.820> up

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:39.910 
or a rim if you want to call coming up

00:04:39.910 --> 00:04:41.219 
or a rim if you want to call coming up
from<00:04:40.000> the<00:04:40.090> shoulder<00:04:40.449> this<00:04:40.990> is<00:04:41.139> the<00:04:41.169> shoulder

00:04:41.219 --> 00:04:41.229 
from the shoulder this is the shoulder

00:04:41.229 --> 00:04:42.810 
from the shoulder this is the shoulder
of<00:04:41.590> a<00:04:41.680> vessel<00:04:41.889> there's<00:04:42.280> parts<00:04:42.520> of<00:04:42.580> the<00:04:42.639> vessel

00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:42.820 
of a vessel there's parts of the vessel

00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:44.310 
of a vessel there's parts of the vessel
this<00:04:43.120> is<00:04:43.270> the<00:04:43.360> shoulder<00:04:43.600> coming<00:04:43.990> up<00:04:44.110> and

00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:44.320 
this is the shoulder coming up and

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:45.779 
this is the shoulder coming up and
usually<00:04:44.740> the<00:04:44.949> rim<00:04:45.130> of<00:04:45.160> the<00:04:45.340> lip<00:04:45.490> would<00:04:45.610> be<00:04:45.699> at

00:04:45.779 --> 00:04:45.789 
usually the rim of the lip would be at

00:04:45.789 --> 00:04:47.610 
usually the rim of the lip would be at
the<00:04:45.880> top<00:04:46.090> but<00:04:46.300> just<00:04:46.479> because<00:04:46.720> this<00:04:46.990> design<00:04:47.500> of

00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:47.620 
the top but just because this design of

00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:49.409 
the top but just because this design of
this<00:04:47.740> that's<00:04:48.010> right<00:04:48.190> here<00:04:48.490> so<00:04:49.000> which<00:04:49.180> makes

00:04:49.409 --> 00:04:49.419 
this that's right here so which makes

00:04:49.419 --> 00:04:51.000 
this that's right here so which makes
this<00:04:49.630> a<00:04:49.690> good<00:04:49.870> candidate<00:04:50.350> for<00:04:50.380> this<00:04:50.590> style<00:04:50.830> of

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:51.010 
this a good candidate for this style of

00:04:51.010 --> 00:04:57.930 
this a good candidate for this style of
carry<00:04:51.580> this<00:04:52.539> now<00:04:52.720> gene<00:04:52.990> in<00:04:53.169> particular<00:04:56.940> it's

00:04:57.930 --> 00:04:57.940 
carry this now gene in particular it's

00:04:57.940 --> 00:04:59.310 
carry this now gene in particular it's
because<00:04:58.210> it<00:04:58.300> has<00:04:58.449> this<00:04:58.570> little<00:04:58.750> rim<00:04:59.020> and<00:04:59.199> lip

00:04:59.310 --> 00:04:59.320 
because it has this little rim and lip

00:04:59.320 --> 00:05:00.990 
because it has this little rim and lip
and<00:04:59.470> it<00:04:59.560> gives<00:04:59.740> us<00:04:59.889> something<00:05:00.130> to<00:05:00.550> bite<00:05:00.820> onto

00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:01.000 
and it gives us something to bite onto

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:03.870 
and it gives us something to bite onto
underneath<00:05:02.070> but<00:05:03.070> if<00:05:03.160> you<00:05:03.250> don't<00:05:03.460> have<00:05:03.639> this

00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:03.880 
underneath but if you don't have this

00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:06.450 
underneath but if you don't have this
you<00:05:04.449> can<00:05:04.630> do<00:05:04.780> you<00:05:05.020> can<00:05:05.139> make<00:05:05.169> a<00:05:05.410> bottle<00:05:06.100> sling

00:05:06.450 --> 00:05:06.460 
you can do you can make a bottle sling

00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:09.270 
you can do you can make a bottle sling
holder<00:05:07.410> paracord<00:05:08.410> bottle<00:05:08.740> holder<00:05:09.010> sling

to sling this the next step would be you

00:05:40.570 --> 00:05:42.000 
to sling this the next step would be you
can<00:05:40.720> sort<00:05:40.990> of<00:05:41.020> just<00:05:41.080> tie<00:05:41.289> this<00:05:41.349> off<00:05:41.680> a<00:05:41.710> reef

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:42.010 
can sort of just tie this off a reef

00:05:42.010 --> 00:05:48.689 
can sort of just tie this off a reef
knot<00:05:42.190> on<00:05:42.460> here

00:05:48.689 --> 00:05:48.699 

00:05:48.699 --> 00:05:50.879 

put<00:05:49.270> a<00:05:49.300> reef<00:05:49.539> knot<00:05:49.569> on<00:05:49.960> there<00:05:50.169> and<00:05:50.379> then<00:05:50.680> you

00:05:50.879 --> 00:05:50.889 
put a reef knot on there and then you

00:05:50.889 --> 00:05:54.860 
put a reef knot on there and then you
could<00:05:51.009> put<00:05:51.280> an<00:05:51.430> adjustable<00:05:51.969> shoulder<00:05:52.439> sling

00:05:54.860 --> 00:05:54.870 
could put an adjustable shoulder sling

00:05:54.870 --> 00:05:57.779 
could put an adjustable shoulder sling

00:05:57.779 --> 00:05:57.789 
but this is the jug Slipknot this is

00:05:57.789 --> 00:05:59.550 
but this is the jug Slipknot this is
correct<00:05:57.969> signing<00:05:58.360> out<00:05:58.449> back<00:05:58.659> outdoors<00:05:59.110> later
