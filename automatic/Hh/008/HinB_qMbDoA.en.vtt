 they play in big stages but that 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:41.519
 It makes for a fun and energetic time 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:42.899
 in pubs or bars that allow 

00:00:41.519 --> 00:00:44.609
 include live music in your

 programming as every year the

 organization has wanted to include everything 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:51.220
 kind of styles that's why 

00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:53.410
 of the riverbank were the most diverse 

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:54.910

 his repertoire after eight o'clock in the 

00:00:57.010 --> 00:01:00.430
 late the place will be as always the 

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:02.590

 completely free entry will be at

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:15.550
 late from 8 o'clock the figures 

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:18.729
 great weak rock the ideal stage for

 all the nagusia aste programming 

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:29.290
 but in this case the capacity is limited 

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:31.840
 therefore those who lovers 

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:34.240
 we ask that you be attentive and that they go 

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:37.030
 punctual to not be left without being able to see 

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:38.500
 to these magnificent bands the English is 

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:40.330
 the language most used by the bands 

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:41.980
 that will play the ebit or rock but also 

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:43.420
 there are Basque groups the level of 

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:45.340
 groupings has been defined by the 

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:47.440
 sworn as very high the age of the 

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:48.910
 participants is very heterogeneous since 

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:50.410
 consecrated musicians with a wide 

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:52.360
 musical career within the scene 

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:55.290
 local to young promises who give their 

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:55.290
 first steps in music 

00:01:55.300 --> 00:02:00.140
 touch on my side 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:00.140
 take note 

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:05.950
 bilbao has been a little bit sought after 

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:08.259
 it's a pride 

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:09.610
 you want it here to prove that 

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:12.010
 here, locally, there are very good 

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:13.690
 groups of doing it there's the best 

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:15.040
 possible we have been lucky that he has 

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:16.840
 coincided the same day some friends 

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:18.250
 our this conflict is that we have 

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:20.500
 shared the stage with them other 

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:23.650
 Sometimes they are local colleagues. 

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:26.230
 old friends and over similar style or 

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:28.630
 be what double happiness and the first of 

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:30.190
 we all want to thank part of all the 

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:34.560
 band to the organization for having us 

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:36.910
 invited to this event and they are things that 

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:39.160
 they emerge a lot what is the scene 

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:41.739
 local and by us then totally 

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:44.319
 grateful if you always look forward to playing 

00:02:41.739 --> 00:02:45.430
 at parties in your house no and participate in 

00:02:44.319 --> 00:02:47.860
 the nagusia aste 

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:50.230
 getting a little bit of rock and roll and 

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:52.239
 to party also at parties but 

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:53.360
 everything for me because this couple is from 

00:02:52.239 --> 00:02:55.220
 Madrid 

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:58.250
 but what of now CÃ¡diz in August 

00:02:55.220 --> 00:03:01.260
 ended up in barakaldo good you are weak 

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:03.390
 it does not really attack either 

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:06.209
 you always expect you to be 

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:08.189
 chosen clear for that you present to me 

00:03:06.209 --> 00:03:09.780
 I think the other bands surely 

00:03:08.189 --> 00:03:13.110
 many would also deserve but in the end 

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:15.930
 is what the jury chooses and looks 

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:17.670
 Any luck that certainly are 

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:19.290
 they themselves who can best 

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:21.420
 explain what we will find in 

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:23.700
 the actions of these young people and not 

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:27.299
 so young artists a little bit of 

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:29.430
 Good energy quality of many 

00:03:27.299 --> 00:03:33.030
 power in the subjects 

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:36.090
 and many want the hybrid between the 

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:40.640
 maximum cane and the sweetest melodic that 

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:42.599
 it's a bit bittersweet reed brutality 

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:43.709
 above all music made with the heart 

00:03:42.599 --> 00:03:45.780
 Lots of energy 

00:03:43.709 --> 00:03:51.200
 up the stage if rock and 

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:51.200
 roll marching and fun especially 

00:03:57.880 --> 00:04:02.030
 during the nagusia aste the public may 

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:03.680
 check the quality of these bands that 

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:04.220
 they struggle to take a step forward in their 

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:06.230
 careers 

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:07.850
 Who knows the world of music? 

00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:11.350
 strange ways and can still for the 

00:04:07.850 --> 00:04:11.350
 stardom to any of them
