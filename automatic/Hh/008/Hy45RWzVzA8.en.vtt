bases<00:02:16.159> and<00:02:16.430> that<00:02:16.489> base<00:02:17.209> was<00:02:17.420> the<00:02:17.540> one<00:02:17.689> that<00:02:17.870> I

00:02:17.979 --> 00:02:17.989 
bases and that base was the one that I

00:02:17.989 --> 00:02:20.470 
bases and that base was the one that I
one<00:02:18.409> shard<00:02:18.709> in<00:02:18.950> the<00:02:19.069> previous<00:02:19.459> episode<00:02:19.670> so

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:20.480 
one shard in the previous episode so

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:23.259 
one shard in the previous episode so
that<00:02:20.749> sucked<00:02:21.079> on<00:02:21.260> my<00:02:21.409> part<00:02:21.709> so<00:02:22.489> for<00:02:22.790> the<00:02:22.879> topic

00:02:23.259 --> 00:02:23.269 
that sucked on my part so for the topic

00:02:23.269 --> 00:02:25.089 
that sucked on my part so for the topic
of<00:02:23.389> today<00:02:23.659> I<00:02:23.689> guess<00:02:24.109> we<00:02:24.290> can<00:02:24.409> talk<00:02:24.590> about<00:02:24.739> clan

00:02:25.089 --> 00:02:25.099 
of today I guess we can talk about clan

00:02:25.099 --> 00:02:27.699 
of today I guess we can talk about clan
wars<00:02:25.430> because<00:02:25.670> this<00:02:26.150> is<00:02:26.359> a<00:02:26.420> clan<00:02:26.930> wars<00:02:27.230> related

00:02:27.699 --> 00:02:27.709 
wars because this is a clan wars related

00:02:27.709 --> 00:02:29.920 
wars because this is a clan wars related
video<00:02:28.040> and<00:02:28.340> also<00:02:28.849> because<00:02:29.269> of<00:02:29.480> the<00:02:29.510> recent

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:29.930 
video and also because of the recent

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:31.599 
video and also because of the recent
update<00:02:30.439> that<00:02:30.620> came<00:02:30.859> out<00:02:31.040> that<00:02:31.069> strongly

00:02:31.599 --> 00:02:31.609 
update that came out that strongly

00:02:31.609 --> 00:02:34.390 
update that came out that strongly
related<00:02:32.030> to<00:02:32.629> clan<00:02:32.959> wars<00:02:33.230> now<00:02:33.709> I've<00:02:33.950> always<00:02:34.129> had

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:34.400 
related to clan wars now I've always had

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:36.009 
related to clan wars now I've always had
this<00:02:34.549> thought<00:02:34.760> in<00:02:34.909> my<00:02:35.030> mind<00:02:35.060> and<00:02:35.540> I<00:02:35.599> asked<00:02:35.930> some

00:02:36.009 --> 00:02:36.019 
this thought in my mind and I asked some

00:02:36.019 --> 00:02:37.270 
this thought in my mind and I asked some
of<00:02:36.049> my<00:02:36.139> buddies<00:02:36.379> what<00:02:36.709> they<00:02:36.799> thought<00:02:36.950> about<00:02:37.010> it

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:37.280 
of my buddies what they thought about it

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:39.819 
of my buddies what they thought about it
and<00:02:38.049> it's<00:02:39.049> something<00:02:39.409> that<00:02:39.530> I've<00:02:39.620> never

00:02:39.819 --> 00:02:39.829 
and it's something that I've never

00:02:39.829 --> 00:02:41.679 
and it's something that I've never
really<00:02:40.159> got<00:02:40.370> ever<00:02:40.609> since<00:02:40.909> clan<00:02:41.150> wars<00:02:41.359> came<00:02:41.569> out

00:02:41.679 --> 00:02:41.689 
really got ever since clan wars came out

00:02:41.689 --> 00:02:43.839 
really got ever since clan wars came out
where<00:02:41.870> ever<00:02:42.109> since<00:02:42.409> clan<00:02:42.739> was<00:02:42.919> evolved<00:02:43.549> is

00:02:43.839 --> 00:02:43.849 
where ever since clan was evolved is

00:02:43.849 --> 00:02:46.390 
where ever since clan was evolved is
some<00:02:44.540> clans<00:02:44.780> having<00:02:45.200> war<00:02:45.499> star<00:02:45.769> requirements

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:46.400 
some clans having war star requirements

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:48.550 
some clans having war star requirements
now<00:02:46.909> I<00:02:46.939> get<00:02:47.329> the<00:02:47.419> whole<00:02:47.540> feel<00:02:47.870> of<00:02:47.900> some<00:02:48.319> clans

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:48.560 
now I get the whole feel of some clans

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:50.949 
now I get the whole feel of some clans
being<00:02:48.829> 24-7<00:02:49.760> war<00:02:50.030> and<00:02:50.389> how<00:02:50.510> they<00:02:50.659> want<00:02:50.840> the

00:02:50.949 --> 00:02:50.959 
being 24-7 war and how they want the

00:02:50.959 --> 00:02:52.839 
being 24-7 war and how they want the
best<00:02:51.200> attackers<00:02:51.829> in<00:02:52.040> their<00:02:52.219> clan<00:02:52.430> wars<00:02:52.669> in

00:02:52.839 --> 00:02:52.849 
best attackers in their clan wars in

00:02:52.849 --> 00:02:54.640 
best attackers in their clan wars in
order<00:02:53.030> to<00:02:53.150> maximize<00:02:53.569> their<00:02:53.750> stars<00:02:54.079> and<00:02:54.439> win

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:54.650 
order to maximize their stars and win

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:56.289 
order to maximize their stars and win
but<00:02:55.189> then<00:02:55.340> again<00:02:55.459> you<00:02:55.669> also<00:02:56.060> have<00:02:56.209> the

00:02:56.289 --> 00:02:56.299 
but then again you also have the

00:02:56.299 --> 00:02:58.839 
but then again you also have the
possibility<00:02:56.780> of<00:02:57.139> having<00:02:57.769> some<00:02:58.219> players<00:02:58.489> who

00:02:58.839 --> 00:02:58.849 
possibility of having some players who

00:02:58.849 --> 00:03:01.149 
possibility of having some players who
go<00:02:59.150> inactive<00:02:59.419> for<00:02:59.840> a<00:02:59.900> while<00:03:00.139> who<00:03:00.680> then<00:03:00.889> come

00:03:01.149 --> 00:03:01.159 
go inactive for a while who then come

00:03:01.159 --> 00:03:03.280 
go inactive for a while who then come
back<00:03:01.189> but<00:03:01.790> are<00:03:02.000> still<00:03:02.239> pretty<00:03:02.510> good<00:03:02.719> at<00:03:02.840> war<00:03:03.049> or

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:03.290 
back but are still pretty good at war or

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:04.869 
back but are still pretty good at war or
maybe<00:03:03.680> you<00:03:03.829> have<00:03:04.010> a<00:03:04.040> really<00:03:04.459> good<00:03:04.549> attacker

00:03:04.869 --> 00:03:04.879 
maybe you have a really good attacker

00:03:04.879 --> 00:03:07.089 
maybe you have a really good attacker
but<00:03:05.299> he<00:03:05.480> doesn't<00:03:05.719> like<00:03:05.840> warring<00:03:06.199> a<00:03:06.260> lot<00:03:06.469> and<00:03:06.709> he

00:03:07.089 --> 00:03:07.099 
but he doesn't like warring a lot and he

00:03:07.099 --> 00:03:09.220 
but he doesn't like warring a lot and he
only<00:03:07.189> has<00:03:07.340> a<00:03:07.370> few<00:03:07.519> stars<00:03:07.969> because<00:03:08.329> he<00:03:08.510> Wars<00:03:08.780> now

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:09.230 
only has a few stars because he Wars now

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:11.199 
only has a few stars because he Wars now
and<00:03:09.530> then<00:03:09.739> but<00:03:10.280> then<00:03:10.459> compare<00:03:10.909> this<00:03:11.060> to

00:03:11.199 --> 00:03:11.209 
and then but then compare this to

00:03:11.209 --> 00:03:13.809 
and then but then compare this to
someone<00:03:11.449> who<00:03:11.689> was<00:03:11.870> 24<00:03:12.379> 7<00:03:12.889> who<00:03:13.129> has<00:03:13.370> accumulated

00:03:13.809 --> 00:03:13.819 
someone who was 24 7 who has accumulated

00:03:13.819 --> 00:03:17.500 
someone who was 24 7 who has accumulated
a<00:03:14.299> crap<00:03:14.659> ton<00:03:14.689> of<00:03:15.169> war<00:03:15.409> stars<00:03:15.739> but<00:03:16.609> is<00:03:16.909> still<00:03:17.269> a

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:17.510 
a crap ton of war stars but is still a

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:19.809 
a crap ton of war stars but is still a
pretty<00:03:17.840> shitty<00:03:18.169> attacker<00:03:18.709> consistently<00:03:19.639> I

00:03:19.809 --> 00:03:19.819 
pretty shitty attacker consistently I

00:03:19.819 --> 00:03:21.610 
pretty shitty attacker consistently I
guess<00:03:20.419> in<00:03:20.599> some<00:03:20.810> ways<00:03:20.870> this<00:03:21.259> is<00:03:21.409> pretty

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:21.620 
guess in some ways this is pretty

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:23.770 
guess in some ways this is pretty
comparable<00:03:22.069> to<00:03:22.400> how<00:03:22.699> the<00:03:22.759> player<00:03:23.239> profile

00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:23.780 
comparable to how the player profile

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:25.659 
comparable to how the player profile
when<00:03:23.989> it<00:03:24.109> was<00:03:24.229> introduced<00:03:24.799> kind<00:03:25.189> of<00:03:25.280> fucked<00:03:25.519> a

00:03:25.659 --> 00:03:25.669 
when it was introduced kind of fucked a

00:03:25.669 --> 00:03:27.670 
when it was introduced kind of fucked a
lot<00:03:25.879> of<00:03:26.030> people<00:03:26.359> over<00:03:26.780> because<00:03:27.139> it<00:03:27.319> made<00:03:27.500> them

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:27.680 
lot of people over because it made them

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:29.499 
lot of people over because it made them
seem<00:03:27.949> a<00:03:28.129> lot<00:03:28.400> more<00:03:28.430> new<00:03:28.909> beer<00:03:29.090> than<00:03:29.329> they<00:03:29.449> were

00:03:29.499 --> 00:03:29.509 
seem a lot more new beer than they were

00:03:29.509 --> 00:03:31.780 
seem a lot more new beer than they were
just<00:03:30.229> because<00:03:30.530> of<00:03:30.650> the<00:03:30.680> fact<00:03:30.769> that<00:03:31.129> a<00:03:31.280> lot<00:03:31.639> of

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:31.790 
just because of the fact that a lot of

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:34.809 
just because of the fact that a lot of
players<00:03:32.109> formed<00:03:33.109> maybe<00:03:33.409> one<00:03:33.769> year<00:03:33.799> two<00:03:34.489> years

00:03:34.809 --> 00:03:34.819 
players formed maybe one year two years

00:03:34.819 --> 00:03:36.879 
players formed maybe one year two years
of<00:03:35.000> their<00:03:35.150> base<00:03:35.389> before<00:03:35.750> the<00:03:36.229> player<00:03:36.439> profile

00:03:36.879 --> 00:03:36.889 
of their base before the player profile

00:03:36.889 --> 00:03:39.249 
of their base before the player profile
came<00:03:37.159> out<00:03:37.370> and<00:03:37.579> all<00:03:38.299> that<00:03:38.329> gold<00:03:38.780> and<00:03:39.049> all<00:03:39.139> that

00:03:39.249 --> 00:03:39.259 
came out and all that gold and all that

00:03:39.259 --> 00:03:41.229 
came out and all that gold and all that
elixir<00:03:39.530> and<00:03:39.709> all<00:03:39.829> that<00:03:39.949> dark<00:03:40.189> elixir<00:03:40.370> was<00:03:41.060> not

00:03:41.229 --> 00:03:41.239 
elixir and all that dark elixir was not

00:03:41.239 --> 00:03:43.300 
elixir and all that dark elixir was not
recorded<00:03:41.840> then<00:03:42.019> so<00:03:42.439> I<00:03:42.470> don't<00:03:42.590> know<00:03:42.739> some<00:03:43.129> what

00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:43.310 
recorded then so I don't know some what

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:44.439 
recorded then so I don't know some what
you<00:03:43.400> guys<00:03:43.519> think<00:03:43.790> because<00:03:44.120> it's<00:03:44.269> something

00:03:44.439 --> 00:03:44.449 
you guys think because it's something

00:03:44.449 --> 00:03:45.879 
you guys think because it's something
that<00:03:44.659> I've<00:03:44.810> always<00:03:44.989> thought<00:03:45.290> about<00:03:45.500> now<00:03:45.739> and

00:03:45.879 --> 00:03:45.889 
that I've always thought about now and

00:03:45.889 --> 00:03:47.289 
that I've always thought about now and
then<00:03:46.069> and<00:03:46.310> it's<00:03:46.459> always<00:03:46.609> been<00:03:46.879> something<00:03:47.090> that

00:03:47.289 --> 00:03:47.299 
then and it's always been something that

00:03:47.299 --> 00:03:49.869 
then and it's always been something that
I<00:03:47.329> debate<00:03:47.720> here<00:03:48.199> and<00:03:48.319> there<00:03:48.470> with<00:03:48.650> myself<00:03:49.159> just

00:03:49.869 --> 00:03:49.879 
I debate here and there with myself just

00:03:49.879 --> 00:03:51.759 
I debate here and there with myself just
thinking<00:03:50.120> about<00:03:50.180> how<00:03:50.900> many<00:03:51.109> people<00:03:51.530> are

00:03:51.759 --> 00:03:51.769 
thinking about how many people are

00:03:51.769 --> 00:03:53.740 
thinking about how many people are
discriminating<00:03:52.609> other<00:03:52.819> people<00:03:53.209> based<00:03:53.540> on

00:03:53.740 --> 00:03:53.750 
discriminating other people based on

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:56.020 
discriminating other people based on
their<00:03:53.810> statistics<00:03:54.560> even<00:03:55.340> though<00:03:55.519> they<00:03:55.729> could

00:03:56.020 --> 00:03:56.030 
their statistics even though they could

00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:58.420 
their statistics even though they could
be<00:03:56.329> a<00:03:56.599> better<00:03:57.259> player<00:03:57.530> than<00:03:57.560> they<00:03:57.859> are<00:03:57.979> better

00:03:58.420 --> 00:03:58.430 
be a better player than they are better

00:03:58.430 --> 00:04:00.309 
be a better player than they are better
player<00:03:58.699> than<00:03:58.790> they<00:03:59.030> present<00:03:59.719> themselves<00:03:59.870> as

00:04:00.309 --> 00:04:00.319 
player than they present themselves as

00:04:00.319 --> 00:04:02.140 
player than they present themselves as
and<00:04:00.949> I<00:04:01.280> always<00:04:01.430> find<00:04:01.729> these<00:04:01.879> kind<00:04:02.090> of

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:02.150 
and I always find these kind of

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:03.819 
and I always find these kind of
questions<00:04:02.299> pretty<00:04:02.959> interesting<00:04:03.530> to<00:04:03.650> talk

00:04:03.819 --> 00:04:03.829 
questions pretty interesting to talk

00:04:03.829 --> 00:04:05.559 
questions pretty interesting to talk
about<00:04:03.889> throughout<00:04:04.729> some<00:04:05.000> of<00:04:05.090> these<00:04:05.180> videos

00:04:05.559 --> 00:04:05.569 
about throughout some of these videos

00:04:05.569 --> 00:04:06.789 
about throughout some of these videos
because<00:04:05.599> you<00:04:06.079> get<00:04:06.169> to<00:04:06.229> see<00:04:06.469> a<00:04:06.500> lot<00:04:06.739> of

00:04:06.789 --> 00:04:06.799 
because you get to see a lot of

00:04:06.799 --> 00:04:09.969 
because you get to see a lot of
perspectives<00:04:07.459> from<00:04:08.180> myself<00:04:08.449> and<00:04:08.959> also<00:04:09.439> from

00:04:09.969 --> 00:04:09.979 
perspectives from myself and also from

00:04:09.979 --> 00:04:12.099 
perspectives from myself and also from
you<00:04:10.280> guys<00:04:10.430> in<00:04:10.759> the<00:04:10.819> comments<00:04:11.090> and<00:04:11.509> personally

you guys in the comments and personally

00:04:12.109 --> 00:04:13.869 
you guys in the comments and personally
I<00:04:12.139> find<00:04:12.500> it<00:04:12.680> a<00:04:12.739> little<00:04:12.919> bit<00:04:13.129> more<00:04:13.280> entertaining

00:04:13.869 --> 00:04:13.879 
I find it a little bit more entertaining

00:04:13.879 --> 00:04:16.149 
I find it a little bit more entertaining
to<00:04:14.000> sit<00:04:14.629> back<00:04:14.810> after<00:04:15.229> you<00:04:15.289> watch<00:04:15.500> a<00:04:15.620> video<00:04:15.919> and

00:04:16.149 --> 00:04:16.159 
to sit back after you watch a video and

00:04:16.159 --> 00:04:17.860 
to sit back after you watch a video and
just<00:04:16.310> get<00:04:16.549> your<00:04:16.669> mind<00:04:16.880> jogging<00:04:17.419> a<00:04:17.509> little<00:04:17.750> bit

00:04:17.860 --> 00:04:17.870 
just get your mind jogging a little bit

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:19.089 
just get your mind jogging a little bit
and<00:04:17.959> now<00:04:18.079> it<00:04:18.199> kind<00:04:18.380> of<00:04:18.409> seems<00:04:18.469> a<00:04:18.709> little<00:04:18.829> nerdy

00:04:19.089 --> 00:04:19.099 
and now it kind of seems a little nerdy

00:04:19.099 --> 00:04:20.529 
and now it kind of seems a little nerdy
and<00:04:19.370> a<00:04:19.430> little<00:04:19.639> asian<00:04:19.820> thing<00:04:20.120> for<00:04:20.299> me<00:04:20.389> to<00:04:20.419> say

00:04:20.529 --> 00:04:20.539 
and a little asian thing for me to say

00:04:20.539 --> 00:04:23.200 
and a little asian thing for me to say
but<00:04:21.049> personally<00:04:21.829> I<00:04:21.859> find<00:04:22.190> it<00:04:22.370> way<00:04:22.580> more<00:04:22.610> fun<00:04:23.060> to

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:23.210 
but personally I find it way more fun to

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:25.400 
but personally I find it way more fun to
commentate<00:04:23.690> like<00:04:23.930> this<00:04:24.169> rather<00:04:24.440> than

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:25.410

you guys know that you guys can see the

00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:14.930 
you guys know that you guys can see the
Tesla<00:05:12.570> placements<00:05:13.110> on<00:05:13.260> anyone's<00:05:14.040> base<00:05:14.280> using

00:05:14.930 --> 00:05:14.940 
Tesla placements on anyone's base using

00:05:14.940 --> 00:05:17.360 
Tesla placements on anyone's base using
that<00:05:15.120> preview<00:05:15.630> base<00:05:16.110> thing<00:05:16.500> now<00:05:16.950> I<00:05:16.980> don't<00:05:17.160> know

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:17.370 
that preview base thing now I don't know

00:05:17.370 --> 00:05:19.250 
that preview base thing now I don't know
if<00:05:17.400> this<00:05:17.550> is<00:05:17.610> a<00:05:17.760> glitch<00:05:18.090> or<00:05:18.240> not<00:05:18.420> or<00:05:18.840> something

00:05:19.250 --> 00:05:19.260 
if this is a glitch or not or something

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:21.590 
if this is a glitch or not or something
that<00:05:19.440> supercell<00:05:20.130> overlooked<00:05:20.790> but<00:05:21.090> it's<00:05:21.390> kind

00:05:21.590 --> 00:05:21.600 
that supercell overlooked but it's kind

00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:22.970 
that supercell overlooked but it's kind
of<00:05:21.660> shitty<00:05:21.870> and<00:05:22.170> they<00:05:22.410> should<00:05:22.590> take<00:05:22.740> it<00:05:22.860> out

00:05:22.970 --> 00:05:22.980 
of shitty and they should take it out

00:05:22.980 --> 00:05:25.010 
of shitty and they should take it out
because<00:05:23.160> Tesla<00:05:24.090> placements<00:05:24.630> are<00:05:24.750> pretty

00:05:25.010 --> 00:05:25.020 
because Tesla placements are pretty

00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:26.570 
because Tesla placements are pretty
important<00:05:25.590> especially<00:05:25.830> when<00:05:26.160> it<00:05:26.250> comes<00:05:26.400> to

00:05:26.570 --> 00:05:26.580 
important especially when it comes to

00:05:26.580 --> 00:05:29.510 
important especially when it comes to
multiplayer<00:05:27.240> bases<00:05:27.720> at<00:05:28.320> any<00:05:28.680> high<00:05:28.920> level<00:05:29.280> and

multiplayer bases at any high level and

00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:31.580 
multiplayer bases at any high level and
if<00:05:30.270> you<00:05:30.420> want<00:05:30.570> to<00:05:30.630> keep<00:05:30.750> a<00:05:30.870> base<00:05:31.020> secret<00:05:31.380> for

00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:32.970 
some reason that you just don't want

00:05:32.970 --> 00:05:34.490 
some reason that you just don't want
people<00:05:33.030> to<00:05:33.330> see<00:05:33.510> where<00:05:34.170> your<00:05:34.290> Tesla
