[JUNGBUB TALK] 0172. Day Dreaming

00:00:00.880 --> 00:00:02.120
[Jungbub Terminology]
Grand Nature: the whole-dimensional Universe
Jungbub: ‘the Righteous Law’ in Korean, the law of Grand Nature
Seuseungnim: the Great Mentor who gives out the law of Grand Nature

00:00:04.360 --> 00:00:10.100
Question: It is said a person who wanders trying this and that is called as a day dreamer.

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:14.120
I was just wondering why these people tend to behave such things.

00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:20.780
Day dreaming, this is a fun question.

00:00:20.780 --> 00:00:33.240
A person who wanders around following lofty ideal and cannot concentrate on one field diligently is called as a day dreamer.

00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:44.020
The reason this kind of people day dream is because they have big energy in themselves but did not learn the basic properly.

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:54.500
They tend to challenge things they want, but they couldn’t deal with it appropriately unfulfilling their own basic study.

00:00:54.500 --> 00:01:04.100
Because they couldn’t get what they wanted, it looks like they are day dreaming.

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:12.960
If they made it, they would become a person called successful men.

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:19.980
When having greedy goal without matched capacity, precisely it will not succeed.

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:24.520
This is how they became day dreamers.

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:34.060
Trying to possess something big without matched efforts, won’t make a result.

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:42.800
However, having success in even a small step could bring power to achieve the next goal.

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:51.820
In disregard of these steps, it can’t be straightened right away.

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:59.600
You might think of a person who haven’t worked hard and studied but become a rich.

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:05.840
But the meaning of becoming a rich, is actually they have been accumulating their efforts little by little,

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:11.400
thinking about their environment deeply.

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:15.680
Have you checked their profundity of thought?

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:19.320
There are obvious reasons why wealth was given to them.

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:22.920
You may wonder why you don’t have wealth,

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:28.380
considering yourself having been learning and performing basic duties to the people,

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:31.460
without understanding their profundity of thought.

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:41.060
It’s because you’ve been doing wasting jobs and not been fulfilling yourself to keep wealth.

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:44.820
There is obviously certain reason why you don’t have money.

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:59.460
If a person, who was not supposed to have wealth, got money, then the nature allowing this must be in an error.

00:02:59.460 --> 00:03:03.320
We should discriminate the day dreamer righteously.

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:16.400
This people would always become the dreamers, because they pursue the lofty ideal without fulfilling themselves.

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:22.400
If you try to achieve a goal without matched capacity, you will fail,

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:29.140
or even if if you make it, you will definitely be humiliated in public and lose all eventually.

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:33.220
Grand Nature doesn’t operate it wrongly with any chance of error.

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:36.820
We have to discern right about this.

00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:38.860
Day dreaming is no good from now on.

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:42.660
This society is being settled now.

00:03:42.660 --> 00:04:08.340
In the past, there were no assigned positions for the people, so anyone could approach to get the positions,

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:20.300
however this day, the society is re-arranging everything that has been assigned before.

00:04:20.300 --> 00:04:30.800
So, when people, who didn’t fulfill themselves enough, behave arrogant with small wealth, it will be taken away precisely.

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:34.620
And all wealth will go to the person who is supposed to have.

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:48.560
Grand Nature will re-allocate wealth righteously by separating people who aren’t supposed to have wealth from the others.

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:52.880
So, from now on, it is not the era where you can get the wealth because you want it.

00:04:52.880 --> 00:05:00.800
A person who always makes efforts and considers ‘how can I deal well with the environment given to me?’

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:04.040
could gather wealth,

00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:16.440
but the other, who work for the money, would chase after money all the time but would fail to gain it.

00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:20.920
Therefore, for those who try to earn money have become a slave to money,

00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:23.120
so there is no ability of strength they can draw into.

00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:26.080
They can never escape from money.

00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:34.240
However, what will happen if they put money aside and pay attention to properly doing the work given to them?

00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:37.760
How can they handle the work well?

00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:46.740
People who consider this will allow to have wealth automatically as a secondary reward.

00:05:46.740 --> 00:05:56.700
Never consider becoming wealthy when you don’t handle your given work properly, and treat people with no respect.

00:05:56.700 --> 00:06:03.000
This is Jungbubsidae, the era ruled by righteous law.

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:15.580
Starting with this country, this era will begin.
