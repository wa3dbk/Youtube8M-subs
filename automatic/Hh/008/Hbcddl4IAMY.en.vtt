00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:29.050 
guys my thoughts on the quality of these

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:33.510 
guys my thoughts on the quality of these
brushes<00:01:31.170> so<00:01:32.170> before<00:01:32.530> I<00:01:32.560> begin<00:01:32.950> to<00:01:33.160> apply<00:01:33.460> the

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:33.520 
brushes so before I begin to apply the

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:35.970 
brushes so before I begin to apply the
liner<00:01:33.880> I'm<00:01:34.270> gonna<00:01:34.810> just<00:01:35.020> contour<00:01:35.380> my<00:01:35.590> eyes<00:01:35.770> by

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:35.980 
liner I'm gonna just contour my eyes by

00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:38.040 
liner I'm gonna just contour my eyes by
playing<00:01:36.280> a<00:01:36.610> light<00:01:37.030> shade<00:01:37.300> underneath<00:01:37.870> my

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:38.050 
playing a light shade underneath my

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:39.900 
playing a light shade underneath my
brows<00:01:38.290> and<00:01:38.560> then<00:01:38.770> like<00:01:39.010> a<00:01:39.040> neutral<00:01:39.430> brown<00:01:39.640> in

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:39.910 
brows and then like a neutral brown in

00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:41.670 
brows and then like a neutral brown in
the<00:01:40.240> crease<00:01:40.270> so<00:01:40.780> this<00:01:41.140> is<00:01:41.260> basically<00:01:41.590> just

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:41.680 
the crease so this is basically just

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:43.170 
the crease so this is basically just
contouring<00:01:42.280> just<00:01:42.460> to<00:01:42.520> make<00:01:42.670> the<00:01:42.760> eyes<00:01:42.880> stand

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:43.180 
contouring just to make the eyes stand

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:49.440 
contouring just to make the eyes stand
out<00:01:43.330> more
