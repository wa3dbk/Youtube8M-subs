00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.680
 hello today we are going to make a recipe 

00:00:02.270 --> 00:00:08.760
 very good that is a chocolate cake 

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:10.950
 white with blackberry there are two ways to 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:14.549
 do it then you can choose the one 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:17.850
 you want one is that for the base 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:20.100
 of the cake mix butter with 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:23.789
 cookies and then make your own base 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:25.680
 and the other is that they buy a base already pre 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:28.080
 elaborate that they find in the super 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:31.349
 but whatever it may be, remember that the 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:33.300
 they have to bake 10 minutes like 130 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:35.399
 degrees because if you are not going to undo them 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:39.300
 when they take it out of the fridge and we ruin it 

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:43.760
 the cake that we do not want very well said 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:43.760
 this now yes accompany me to the kitchen 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:05.019
 this recipe is wonderful because it has 

00:01:02.739 --> 00:01:07.420
 white chocolate I am addicted to 

00:01:05.019 --> 00:01:10.150
 declared chocolate and then I 

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:12.490
 fascinates the only thing they have to do is 

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:14.830
 put the cream to heat in a pot 

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:17.619
 only that it is hot does not have to 

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:19.690
 boil we already have the cream very hot 

00:01:17.619 --> 00:01:22.860
 and we're going to warn you about chocolate 

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:22.860
 to melt it 

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:35.050
 now we just have to integrate the 

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:35.050
 chocolate with cream 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:40.430
 ah 

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:48.250
 this was already placed the blackberry sauces 

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:48.250
 in the cookie mold 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:58.500
 and finally the only thing they have to 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:02:02.810
 to do is to pour the mixture of the cream and 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:02.810
 chocolate on the blackberries 

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:15.630
 and we are going to expand it so that we 

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:15.630
 stay small 

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:21.819
 and refrigerated 

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:23.980
 ah 

00:02:21.819 --> 00:02:26.560
 then it came out in our cake 

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:28.359
 refrigeration this is not part of the 

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:31.359
 recipe but if I wanted to put because 

00:02:28.359 --> 00:02:35.349
 You can also add 2 

00:02:31.359 --> 00:02:37.420
 raspberries to the center and some blueberries 

00:02:35.349 --> 00:02:39.280
 around and the truth is that it looks 

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:42.000
 really cute then if you want to decorate 

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:44.620
 so your cake will be very cute 

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:46.329
 I hope you enjoy this 

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:48.219
 The truth is that it is one of the 

00:02:46.329 --> 00:02:49.810
 great favorites so I think they're worth 

00:02:48.219 --> 00:02:51.790
 it's very worthwhile that they do it and 

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:54.370
 supposed to be eaten and sold and 

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:57.150
 delicious I send you a kiss and the two 

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:57.150
 for the next
