00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:08.590
 and good good 

00:00:14.199 --> 00:00:21.009
 and the best of all is in the position and 

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:21.009
 over 

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:31.150
 fuck 

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:49.480
 the position you have is good and 

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:49.480
 perfect 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:57.000
 in two ways that people can see it 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:01:00.239
 on the website because it's recording 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.380
 situ everything that is happening here and there 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:05.870
 a lot of people that I want 

00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:05.870
 say that when you've laid 

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:10.830
 Well , that's what I'm telling you 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:17.430
 carrying not everyone has that 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:21.050
 privilege of knowing that you are entering 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:24.500
 It is also entering people and marketing 

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:24.500
 everyone here 

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:32.330
 how is it being done 

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:46.530
 marking lines doing what is the 

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:48.750
 redefined by the people who work in the 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:50.910
 work in what the surveyor does 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:55.370
 because the stakeout information was 

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:55.370
 designed the drawing out of benito 

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:10.140
 do not worry because of this too 

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:12.060
 is going to commission me from the wall or 

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:15.750
 whether I do this here everyone 

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:17.640
 let's do the same no no but it's that 

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:19.770
 Easy for you to put one arm and 

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:22.020
 is not to me what interests me is a 

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:23.940
 challenge if I'm doing this here every 

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:28.310
 we are going to pay what is going 

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:28.310
 touching I carry 

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:41.260
 I remember her 

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:53.900
 people have to be asking about 

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:55.520
 what's up he has several tattoos how many 

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:57.410
 tattoos have either the body that already 

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:58.820
 you have a few I already have some 

00:02:57.410 --> 00:03:00.260
 how many some that can be seen and 

00:02:58.820 --> 00:03:01.340
 others that do not but good and those that do not 

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:06.190
 can see people are wondering 

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:06.190
 where are they then if you can not see that 

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:20.180
 if it really is a lie 

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:21.560
 but then it's worth having a clear 

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:26.800
 at the moment I do not hurt anything because I 

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:26.800
 they are only drawing when gray 

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:31.870
 Clear 

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:42.140
 or we leave it for him to see it, not what 

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:46.130
 applied is not going to be a kind of 

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:49.990
 creeper with roses but it's pretty no 

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:52.610
 it's not the same but it's quite big and 

00:03:49.990 --> 00:03:54.920
 what he is going to do is a cover because I 

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:57.070
 I have a small branch and what 

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:57.070
 I want 

00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:09.820
 then as a buddy to click 

00:04:31.509 --> 00:04:39.620
 I think I'm coming Jorge today 

00:04:34.130 --> 00:04:41.660
 I would concentrate so that what I am 

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:44.060
 thinking that the tattoo is wrong 

00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:45.740
 raised because it should have 

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:48.370
 done what is the part of the gut or 

00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:48.370
 something like that 

00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:54.470
 then yes it seems to me that now 

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:57.349
 It will give us time to little but good 

00:04:54.470 --> 00:04:59.770
 let's see how far the thing of 

00:04:57.349 --> 00:04:59.770
