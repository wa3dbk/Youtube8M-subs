00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:11.303
Hi, here i have a very unique 
model of LED light...

00:00:11.303 --> 00:00:16.250
the Zylight Z90, let's see what 
makes it so special!

00:00:16.642 --> 00:00:23.565
The Z90 it's a very portable and
compact LED light.

00:00:23.565 --> 00:00:29.071
It's has an excellent and tough 
all metal construction

00:00:29.071 --> 00:00:34.000
weighting a total of only 450g.

00:00:34.451 --> 00:00:38.080
It has 1/4"-20 threaded holes on
the bottom

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:44.586
and top for easy mounting 
anywhere.

00:00:44.586 --> 00:00:52.636
It has a front panel with an 
advanced HD-LED module.

00:00:52.636 --> 00:00:56.807
On its side it has an AC/DC 
input

00:00:56.807 --> 00:01:01.500
and it doesn't accept batteries 
directly.

00:01:03.272 --> 00:01:07.943
On the back we find a power 
switch...

00:01:07.943 --> 00:01:09.820
a digital display...

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:16.000
and various controls for the 
different modes.

00:01:17.327 --> 00:01:19.663
The first one is the "White" 
mode...

00:01:19.663 --> 00:01:29.000
where we can select a 5600K or a
3200K light.

00:01:30.966 --> 00:01:39.500
The dimmer lets us adjust the 
intensity of the light in all 
modes.

00:01:45.772 --> 00:01:51.028
Next is the "Gel" mode, where we
use the top dial

00:01:51.028 --> 00:02:00.000
to select any temperature value 
between 2500K and 9000K.

00:02:01.955 --> 00:02:05.500
With the bottom dial we can 
correct the light

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:09.796
towards green or magenta to get 
the desired look

00:02:09.796 --> 00:02:16.000
and be able to mix the Z90 with 
other light sources.

00:02:17.554 --> 00:02:23.060
Last is the "Color" mode, where 
we can use the top dial

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:32.110
to select red, green, blue or 
any other color in between.

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:35.489
With the bottom dial we can 
adjust the saturation

00:02:35.489 --> 00:02:39.900
of the selected color.

00:02:43.664 --> 00:02:47.834
In the "Gel" and "Color" modes 
it's possible to save

00:02:47.834 --> 00:02:57.000
two lighting presets to access 
them quickly in the future.

00:03:00.389 --> 00:03:04.601
The Z90 includes the Zylink 
option which allows to

00:03:04.601 --> 00:03:09.731
wirelessly sync any amount of 
lights and control them

00:03:09.731 --> 00:03:14.778
from a single unit or with an 
optional external controller.

00:03:14.778 --> 00:03:17.364
The DP Kit includes...

00:03:17.364 --> 00:03:23.000
a metal light stand mount...

00:03:24.496 --> 00:03:30.168
a 5/8" stud with a 1/4"-20 screw
on the bottom...

00:03:30.168 --> 00:03:33.588
and the Z90 accessory adapter 
which allows to use

00:03:33.588 --> 00:03:40.000
different add-ons like the 
included barn doors.

00:03:44.516 --> 00:03:49.646
In the "White" and "Gel" modes, 
the Z90 it's excellent

00:03:49.646 --> 00:03:56.945
as a general purpose fixture, 
working as a fill light...

00:03:56.945 --> 00:04:00.949
back or hair light...

00:04:00.949 --> 00:04:06.750
or mounted directly on the 
camera for event shooting.

00:04:06.997 --> 00:04:10.750
But it's most useful in the 
"Color" mode...

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:14.796
giving many creative options.

00:04:14.796 --> 00:04:18.550
For example, it allows us to 
give a more finished look

00:04:18.550 --> 00:04:24.055
to an interview no matter the 
location or background.

00:04:24.055 --> 00:04:27.392
Or it can be used in narrative 
productions

00:04:27.392 --> 00:04:31.300
for an infinity of situations.

00:04:32.731 --> 00:04:36.818
The only thing to keep in mind 
is that...

00:04:36.818 --> 00:04:39.696
in the "White" and "Gel" 
modes...

00:04:39.696 --> 00:04:43.492
multicolored shadows can appear 
if the light is placed

00:04:43.492 --> 00:04:48.622
too close to the subject and 
background.

00:04:48.622 --> 00:04:51.708
This is because of the 
technology used to achieve

00:04:51.708 --> 00:04:55.378
the different colors and 
temperatures...

00:04:55.378 --> 00:04:59.424
but it can be easily avoided by 
keeping a correct distance

00:04:59.424 --> 00:05:03.000
between the light, background 
and subject.

00:05:04.179 --> 00:05:08.350
The Zylight Z90 it's a very 
useful and versatile light

00:05:08.350 --> 00:05:11.019
thanks to its many modes and 
options.

00:05:11.019 --> 00:05:14.022
It's a very unique model thanks 
to its "Color" mode...

00:05:14.022 --> 00:05:17.275
which opens up many creative 
possibilities

00:05:17.275 --> 00:05:20.153
without the need of external 
filtering.

00:05:20.153 --> 00:05:24.241
Plus, it's small size make it 
very easy to take anywhere

00:05:24.241 --> 00:05:28.250
and it can easily have its place
in any lighting kit.
