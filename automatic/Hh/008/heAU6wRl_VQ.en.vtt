equipment what you do is you can plug in

00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:25.190 
equipment what you do is you can plug in
an<00:00:21.570> Ethernet<00:00:22.380> line<00:00:22.700> into<00:00:23.700> this<00:00:23.910> and<00:00:24.300> that<00:00:24.960> goes

00:00:25.190 --> 00:00:25.200 
an Ethernet line into this and that goes

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:27.229 
an Ethernet line into this and that goes
out<00:00:25.410> to<00:00:25.439> a<00:00:25.590> six<00:00:25.919> blocks<00:00:26.250> snake<00:00:26.669> which<00:00:26.939> is<00:00:27.090> this

00:00:27.229 --> 00:00:27.239 
out to a six blocks snake which is this

00:00:27.239 --> 00:00:30.620 
out to a six blocks snake which is this
right<00:00:27.480> here<00:00:28.460> so<00:00:29.460> you<00:00:29.520> plug<00:00:29.759> in<00:00:29.939> even<00:00:30.270> that<00:00:30.390> into

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:30.630 
right here so you plug in even that into

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:34.160 
right here so you plug in even that into
this<00:00:30.809> six<00:00:31.380> box<00:00:32.329> I'm<00:00:33.329> saying<00:00:33.660> so<00:00:33.780> each<00:00:33.930> one<00:00:34.079> of

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:34.170 
this six box I'm saying so each one of

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:36.049 
this six box I'm saying so each one of
these<00:00:34.260> represents<00:00:35.250> one<00:00:35.670> of<00:00:35.700> the<00:00:35.790> guitar

00:00:36.049 --> 00:00:36.059 
these represents one of the guitar

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:37.430 
these represents one of the guitar
strings<00:00:36.300> and<00:00:36.420> you<00:00:36.480> can<00:00:36.600> take<00:00:36.780> a<00:00:36.809> line<00:00:37.079> out<00:00:37.260> for

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440 
strings and you can take a line out for

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:39.320 
strings and you can take a line out for
each<00:00:37.590> one<00:00:37.829> of<00:00:37.890> the<00:00:37.950> guitar<00:00:38.250> strings<00:00:38.580> and<00:00:38.850> I

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:39.330 
each one of the guitar strings and I

00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:43.250 
each one of the guitar strings and I
believe<00:00:39.630> it<00:00:39.780> has<00:00:39.810> a<00:00:39.990> range<00:00:40.980> of<00:00:41.280> a<00:00:41.600> 20<00:00:42.600> DB<00:00:42.900> before

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
believe it has a range of a 20 DB before

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:44.840 
believe it has a range of a 20 DB before
it<00:00:43.380> gets<00:00:43.680> picked<00:00:43.890> up<00:00:44.010> on<00:00:44.160> the<00:00:44.250> next<00:00:44.430> pickup<00:00:44.760> but

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:44.850 
it gets picked up on the next pickup but

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:46.460 
it gets picked up on the next pickup but
this<00:00:45.000> has<00:00:45.150> six<00:00:45.420> individual<00:00:45.930> pickups<00:00:46.320> right

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:46.470 
this has six individual pickups right

00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:50.630 
this has six individual pickups right
here<00:00:46.710> on<00:00:47.220> the<00:00:47.430> actual<00:00:47.700> guitar<00:00:48.020> so<00:00:49.400> you<00:00:50.400> can

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 
here on the actual guitar so you can

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:53.060 
here on the actual guitar so you can
basically<00:00:51.210> what<00:00:51.570> I<00:00:51.600> did<00:00:51.720> was<00:00:51.870> to<00:00:52.770> mess<00:00:52.920> around

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070
