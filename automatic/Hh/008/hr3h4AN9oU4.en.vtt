for<00:02:42.049> video<00:02:42.260> in<00:02:42.879> DC<00:02:43.879> for<00:02:43.910> Potter<00:02:44.470> so<00:02:45.470> we<00:02:45.560> should

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:45.590 
for video in DC for Potter so we should

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:48.610 
for video in DC for Potter so we should
see<00:02:45.950> this<00:02:46.069> pop-up<00:02:46.930> the<00:02:47.930> on-screen<00:02:48.170> display<00:02:48.379> a

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:48.620 
see this pop-up the on-screen display a

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:50.740 
see this pop-up the on-screen display a
pop-up<00:02:48.860> first<00:02:49.280> and<00:02:49.519> then<00:02:50.420> we'll<00:02:50.569> get<00:02:50.690> a

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:50.750 
pop-up first and then we'll get a

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:53.380 
pop-up first and then we'll get a
picture<00:02:51.190> so<00:02:52.190> we're<00:02:52.370> using<00:02:52.489> the<00:02:52.819> the<00:02:53.180> same

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:53.390 
picture so we're using the the same

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:54.970 
picture so we're using the the same
on-screen<00:02:53.750> display<00:02:53.900> that<00:02:54.530> we've<00:02:54.769> been<00:02:54.920> using

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:54.980 
on-screen display that we've been using

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:56.949 
on-screen display that we've been using
over<00:02:55.459> the<00:02:55.549> last<00:02:55.670> couple<00:02:55.819> years<00:02:56.000> 4wd<00:02:56.840> our

00:02:56.949 --> 00:02:56.959 
over the last couple years 4wd our

00:02:56.959 --> 00:02:59.470 
over the last couple years 4wd our
cameras<00:02:57.349> it's<00:02:58.340> laid<00:02:58.640> out<00:02:58.670> pretty<00:02:59.000> nice<00:02:59.209> and

00:02:59.470 --> 00:02:59.480 
cameras it's laid out pretty nice and

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:02.979 
cameras it's laid out pretty nice and
it's<00:02:59.569> very<00:02:59.780> simple<00:03:00.019> to<00:03:00.140> use<00:03:01.510> let's<00:03:02.510> see<00:03:02.720> here

00:03:02.979 --> 00:03:02.989 
it's very simple to use let's see here

00:03:02.989 --> 00:03:06.360 
it's very simple to use let's see here
on<00:03:03.170> either<00:03:03.560> side<00:03:03.920> of<00:03:03.950> the<00:03:04.160> camera<00:03:04.430> is<00:03:04.879> the

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:06.370 
on either side of the camera is the

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:08.860 
on either side of the camera is the
adjustments<00:03:07.370> for<00:03:07.459> the<00:03:07.549> zoom<00:03:07.700> and<00:03:07.819> focus<00:03:07.870> so

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:08.870 
adjustments for the zoom and focus so

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:11.140 
adjustments for the zoom and focus so
right<00:03:09.139> now<00:03:09.170> we<00:03:09.380> resume<00:03:09.829> then<00:03:10.040> to<00:03:10.220> about<00:03:10.489> the<00:03:10.700> 12

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:11.150 
right now we resume then to about the 12

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:13.990 
right now we resume then to about the 12
millimeter<00:03:11.540> range<00:03:11.720> I'm<00:03:11.930> going<00:03:12.650> to<00:03:13.000> increase

00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:14.000 
millimeter range I'm going to increase

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.140 
millimeter range I'm going to increase
the<00:03:14.900> camera<00:03:15.470> number<00:03:15.590> four<00:03:15.889> on<00:03:16.190> our<00:03:16.250> DVR<00:03:16.489> so<00:03:17.060> we

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:17.150 
the camera number four on our DVR so we

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:20.190 
the camera number four on our DVR so we
can<00:03:17.299> take<00:03:17.389> a<00:03:17.450> look<00:03:17.599> here<00:03:18.700> using<00:03:19.700> the

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:20.200 
can take a look here using the

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:22.089 
can take a look here using the
adjustments<00:03:21.200> on<00:03:21.290> the<00:03:21.380> side<00:03:21.590> for<00:03:21.829> zoom<00:03:21.980> and

00:03:22.089 --> 00:03:22.099 
adjustments on the side for zoom and

00:03:22.099 --> 00:03:25.599 
adjustments on the side for zoom and
focus<00:03:22.130> we<00:03:22.880> can<00:03:23.060> adjust<00:03:23.299> this<00:03:24.310> from<00:03:25.310> 12

00:03:25.599 --> 00:03:25.609 
focus we can adjust this from 12

00:03:25.609 --> 00:03:29.610 
focus we can adjust this from 12
millimeter<00:03:26.000> to<00:03:26.630> 2.8<00:03:27.410> so<00:03:28.069> we<00:03:28.340> can<00:03:28.459> go<00:03:28.549> from<00:03:28.790> a

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:29.620 
millimeter to 2.8 so we can go from a

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:32.699 
millimeter to 2.8 so we can go from a
narrow<00:03:30.620> angle<00:03:30.829> so<00:03:31.250> much<00:03:31.459> wide<00:03:31.669> area<00:03:31.910> though

00:03:32.699 --> 00:03:32.709 
narrow angle so much wide area though

00:03:32.709 --> 00:03:35.140 
narrow angle so much wide area though
and<00:03:33.709> let's<00:03:34.310> go<00:03:34.459> through<00:03:34.669> some<00:03:34.970> of<00:03:35.000> the

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:35.150 
and let's go through some of the

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:41.870 
and let's go through some of the
on-screen<00:03:35.510> display<00:03:35.690> settings

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:41.880 

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:44.490 

what<00:03:42.880> I'm<00:03:43.000> using<00:03:43.180> to<00:03:43.330> adjust<00:03:43.900> as<00:03:43.990> doin<00:03:44.170> focus

00:03:44.490 --> 00:03:44.500 
what I'm using to adjust as doin focus

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:52.470 
what I'm using to adjust as doin focus
is<00:03:44.650> a<00:03:44.680> standard<00:03:45.390> precision<00:03:46.390> screwdriver<00:03:51.480> and

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:52.480 
is a standard precision screwdriver and

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:55.710 
is a standard precision screwdriver and
there<00:03:52.720> we<00:03:52.810> go<00:03:52.840> so<00:03:53.830> the<00:03:53.980> reason<00:03:54.310> why<00:03:54.720> the

00:03:55.710 --> 00:03:55.720 
there we go so the reason why the

00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:56.910 
there we go so the reason why the
picture<00:03:56.050> probably<00:03:56.350> looks<00:03:56.500> a<00:03:56.530> little<00:03:56.620> bit<00:03:56.770> more

00:03:56.910 --> 00:03:56.920 
picture probably looks a little bit more

00:03:56.920 --> 00:03:58.500 
picture probably looks a little bit more
clear<00:03:57.220> on<00:03:57.250> our<00:03:57.580> set<00:03:57.819> up<00:03:57.850> and<00:03:58.090> we<00:03:58.150> have<00:03:58.360> at<00:03:58.480> home

00:03:58.500 --> 00:03:58.510 
clear on our set up and we have at home

00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:01.800 
clear on our set up and we have at home
is<00:03:58.870> because<00:03:59.560> we're<00:03:59.770> using<00:03:59.860> a<00:04:00.390> legs<00:04:01.390> two<00:04:01.480> before

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:01.810 
is because we're using a legs two before

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:05.820 
is because we're using a legs two before
