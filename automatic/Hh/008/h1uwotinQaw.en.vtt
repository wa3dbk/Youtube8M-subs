00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:07.890 
thought I'd be getting back into it a

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:10.360 
thought I'd be getting back into it a
lot<00:00:08.010> quicker<00:00:08.280> but<00:00:08.580> I<00:00:08.639> wasn't<00:00:08.940> able<00:00:09.090> to<00:00:09.269> do<00:00:09.389> that

00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:10.370 
lot quicker but I wasn't able to do that

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:12.919 
lot quicker but I wasn't able to do that
over<00:00:11.370> the<00:00:11.460> summer<00:00:11.639> I<00:00:11.969> had<00:00:12.179> started<00:00:12.480> with<00:00:12.690> some

00:00:12.919 --> 00:00:12.929 
over the summer I had started with some

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:14.690 
over the summer I had started with some
radio<00:00:13.170> controlled<00:00:13.530> airplanes<00:00:13.650> and<00:00:14.250> I<00:00:14.460> put<00:00:14.670> a

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:14.700 
radio controlled airplanes and I put a

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:16.039 
radio controlled airplanes and I put a
good<00:00:14.910> amount<00:00:14.969> of<00:00:15.210> time<00:00:15.389> into<00:00:15.660> getting<00:00:15.750> those

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:16.049 
good amount of time into getting those

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:17.870 
good amount of time into getting those
all<00:00:16.199> fixed<00:00:16.560> up<00:00:16.650> and<00:00:16.830> ready<00:00:16.890> to<00:00:17.039> fly<00:00:17.310> again<00:00:17.340> and

00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:17.880 
all fixed up and ready to fly again and

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:20.689 
all fixed up and ready to fly again and
then<00:00:18.630> two<00:00:19.529> nights<00:00:19.560> in<00:00:19.859> a<00:00:19.949> row<00:00:20.100> they<00:00:20.250> ended<00:00:20.490> they

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:20.699 
then two nights in a row they ended they

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:22.370 
then two nights in a row they ended they
both<00:00:20.880> ended<00:00:21.090> up<00:00:21.210> crashing<00:00:21.750> until<00:00:22.080> I<00:00:22.109> finally

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:22.380 
both ended up crashing until I finally

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:23.599 
both ended up crashing until I finally
figured<00:00:22.650> out<00:00:22.769> the<00:00:22.920> problem<00:00:23.189> which<00:00:23.310> was<00:00:23.460> the

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:23.609 
figured out the problem which was the

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:26.450 
figured out the problem which was the
charger<00:00:24.080> and<00:00:25.080> that<00:00:25.199> completely<00:00:25.980> put<00:00:26.220> me<00:00:26.310> off

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:26.460 
charger and that completely put me off

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:27.800 
charger and that completely put me off
to<00:00:26.640> really<00:00:26.820> any<00:00:26.939> of<00:00:27.060> the<00:00:27.119> modeling<00:00:27.510> hobbies

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:27.810 
to really any of the modeling hobbies

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:30.259 
to really any of the modeling hobbies
for<00:00:27.960> quite<00:00:28.140> a<00:00:28.170> while<00:00:28.460> but<00:00:29.460> now<00:00:29.880> I<00:00:29.910> think<00:00:30.029> I'm

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:30.269 
for quite a while but now I think I'm

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:32.200 
for quite a while but now I think I'm
finally<00:00:30.449> starting<00:00:30.660> to<00:00:30.840> get<00:00:30.929> back<00:00:31.080> into<00:00:31.289> it<00:00:31.380> and

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:32.210 
finally starting to get back into it and

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:34.220 
finally starting to get back into it and
once<00:00:33.210> again<00:00:33.329> there<00:00:33.630> hasn't<00:00:33.870> really<00:00:33.899> been<00:00:34.079> much

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:34.230 
once again there hasn't really been much

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:36.440 
once again there hasn't really been much
of<00:00:34.290> a<00:00:34.440> change<00:00:34.620> in<00:00:34.829> the<00:00:34.890> layout<00:00:35.070> I<00:00:35.399> still<00:00:36.360> I'm

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460 
train stuff and I guess what I've

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:10.100 
train stuff and I guess what I've
decided<00:01:08.820> is<00:01:09.180> that<00:01:09.240> while<00:01:09.600> i'm<00:01:09.689> going<00:01:09.810> to<00:01:09.869> try

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
decided is that while i'm going to try

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:12.590

to<00:01:10.200> continue<00:01:10.500> working<00:01:10.740> on<00:01:10.950> a<00:01:10.979> layout<00:01:11.220> i<00:01:12.180> think

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
to continue working on a layout i think

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:14.210 
to continue working on a layout i think
for<00:01:12.720> the<00:01:12.780> past<00:01:12.960> year<00:01:13.350> nothing<00:01:13.560> has<00:01:13.830> changed

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:15.160 
that kind of scenery going along the

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:20.009 
that kind of scenery going along the
wall<00:03:17.040> but<00:03:18.040> in<00:03:18.400> the<00:03:18.609> meantime<00:03:18.850> I'm<00:03:19.480> still

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:23.530 
working on this sd70ace I had this chip

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:25.140 
working on this sd70ace I had this chip
and<00:03:23.739> been<00:03:23.859> meaning<00:03:24.160> to<00:03:24.250> send<00:03:24.400> it<00:03:24.549> back<00:03:24.700> forget

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:26.650 
if I'm supposed to send it to a thorn or

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:29.339 
if I'm supposed to send it to a thorn or
tsunami<00:03:27.209> but<00:03:28.209> I'll<00:03:28.450> be<00:03:28.660> communicating<00:03:29.230> with

00:03:29.339 --> 00:03:29.349 
tsunami but I'll be communicating with

00:03:29.349 --> 00:03:31.319 
tsunami but I'll be communicating with
them<00:03:29.590> worst<00:03:30.069> case<00:03:30.250> scenario<00:03:30.730> is<00:03:30.880> I<00:03:30.970> just<00:03:31.180> ended

00:03:31.319 --> 00:03:31.329 
them worst case scenario is I just ended

00:03:31.329 --> 00:03:33.599 
them worst case scenario is I just ended
up<00:03:31.389> making<00:03:31.569> it<00:03:31.810> a<00:03:31.930> non<00:03:32.650> sound<00:03:33.099> and<00:03:33.340> the<00:03:33.400> lights

00:03:33.599 --> 00:03:33.609 
up making it a non sound and the lights

00:03:33.609 --> 00:03:34.890 
up making it a non sound and the lights
only<00:03:33.819> look<00:03:34.090> a<00:03:34.180> motive<00:03:34.480> because<00:03:34.660> it<00:03:34.780> was

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:34.900 
only look a motive because it was

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:37.259 
only look a motive because it was
shorting<00:03:35.230> out<00:03:35.319> a<00:03:35.380> lot<00:03:35.790> also<00:03:36.790> it<00:03:36.910> has<00:03:37.030> been<00:03:37.180> a

00:03:37.259 --> 00:03:37.269 
shorting out a lot also it has been a

00:03:37.269 --> 00:03:38.849 
shorting out a lot also it has been a
really<00:03:37.630> long<00:03:37.750> time<00:03:37.900> since<00:03:38.319> I've<00:03:38.470> run<00:03:38.650> anything

00:03:38.849 --> 00:03:38.859 
really long time since I've run anything

00:03:38.859 --> 00:03:40.440 
really long time since I've run anything
i'm<00:03:39.160> probably<00:03:39.370> going<00:03:39.639> to<00:03:39.730> go<00:03:39.849> around<00:03:40.120> and

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:40.450 
i'm probably going to go around and

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:44.550 
i'm probably going to go around and
clean<00:03:40.870> all<00:03:41.079> of<00:03:41.380> the<00:03:41.560> locomotive<00:03:43.560> mechanical

00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:44.560 
clean all of the locomotive mechanical

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:45.990 
clean all of the locomotive mechanical
kind<00:03:44.829> of<00:03:44.889> function<00:03:45.310> things<00:03:45.519> in<00:03:45.639> at<00:03:45.730> the<00:03:45.819> wheels

00:03:45.990 --> 00:03:46.000 
kind of function things in at the wheels

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:47.699 
kind of function things in at the wheels
the<00:03:46.209> gears<00:03:46.480> all<00:03:46.690> that<00:03:46.840> stuff<00:03:47.079> ree<00:03:47.319> service

00:03:47.699 --> 00:03:47.709 
the gears all that stuff ree service

00:03:47.709 --> 00:03:49.650 
the gears all that stuff ree service
that<00:03:47.919> so<00:03:48.639> it's<00:03:48.819> all<00:03:48.910> good<00:03:48.970> clean<00:03:49.389> up<00:03:49.540> the

00:03:57.430 --> 00:04:00.120 
coming up here i'll definitely be able
to<00:03:57.549> make<00:03:57.669> videos<00:03:57.730> but<00:03:58.359> the<00:03:59.260> frequency<00:03:59.709> of<00:03:59.739> them

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:00.130 
to make videos but the frequency of them

00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:02.909 
to make videos but the frequency of them
and<00:04:00.400> the<00:04:00.579> amount<00:04:00.880> of<00:04:01.319> railroading<00:04:02.319> equipment

00:04:02.909 --> 00:04:02.919 
and the amount of railroading equipment

00:04:02.919 --> 00:04:05.099 
and the amount of railroading equipment
available<00:04:03.340> to<00:04:03.489> me<00:04:03.609> might<00:04:03.790> be<00:04:03.819> limited<00:04:04.299> for<00:04:04.510> a

00:04:05.099 --> 00:04:05.109 
available to me might be limited for a

00:04:05.109 --> 00:04:08.370 
available to me might be limited for a
good<00:04:05.319> amount<00:04:05.470> of<00:04:05.560> time<00:04:06.299> so<00:04:07.299> that's

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:08.380 
good amount of time so that's

00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:10.350 
good amount of time so that's
that's<00:04:09.100> probably<00:04:09.820> one<00:04:10.000> of<00:04:10.030> the<00:04:10.150> largest

00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:10.360 
that's probably one of the largest

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:11.760 
that's probably one of the largest
factors<00:04:10.840> here<00:04:10.990> as<00:04:11.080> to<00:04:11.200> why<00:04:11.260> I'm<00:04:11.380> trying<00:04:11.680> to
