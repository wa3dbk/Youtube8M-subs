just a very small power and off key on

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:41.569 
just a very small power and off key on
the<00:01:40.140> side<00:01:40.170> here<00:01:40.530> it's<00:01:40.799> very<00:01:41.009> difficult<00:01:41.280> to<00:01:41.430> see

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:41.579 
the side here it's very difficult to see

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:43.550 
the side here it's very difficult to see
but<00:01:41.759> there's<00:01:42.090> a<00:01:42.150> power<00:01:42.390> on/off<00:01:42.720> switch<00:01:42.990> you

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560 
but there's a power on/off switch you

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:44.960 
but there's a power on/off switch you
just<00:01:43.590> slide<00:01:43.979> and<00:01:44.189> the<00:01:44.280> device<00:01:44.430> will<00:01:44.579> turn<00:01:44.729> on

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:44.970 
just slide and the device will turn on

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:46.910 
just slide and the device will turn on
the<00:01:45.390> light<00:01:45.630> will<00:01:45.750> flash<00:01:46.229> showing<00:01:46.680> that<00:01:46.860> the

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:46.920 
the light will flash showing that the

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:49.340 
the light will flash showing that the
device<00:01:47.100> is<00:01:47.130> already<00:01:47.579> fully<00:01:47.880> on<00:01:48.149> like<00:01:48.899> so<00:01:49.170> and

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:49.350 
device is already fully on like so and

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:51.889 
device is already fully on like so and
it's<00:01:49.920> easy<00:01:50.189> to<00:01:50.340> clip<00:01:50.549> onto<00:01:50.729> any<00:01:51.090> again<00:01:51.630> very

00:01:51.889 --> 00:01:51.899 
it's easy to clip onto any again very

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:54.190 
it's easy to clip onto any again very
lightweight<00:01:52.110> very<00:01:52.350> small<00:01:52.770> of<00:01:53.579> course<00:01:53.790> other

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:54.200 
lightweight very small of course other

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:55.999 
lightweight very small of course other
applications<00:01:55.200> of<00:01:55.320> this<00:01:55.439> would<00:01:55.649> be<00:01:55.680> kind<00:01:55.979> of

00:01:55.999 --> 00:01:56.009 
applications of this would be kind of

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:57.709 
applications of this would be kind of
like<00:01:56.130> spying<00:01:56.430> on<00:01:56.610> someone<00:01:57.329> knowing<00:01:57.630> when

00:01:57.709 --> 00:01:57.719 
like spying on someone knowing when

00:01:57.719 --> 00:01:59.209 
like spying on someone knowing when
they're<00:01:57.840> going<00:01:58.469> if<00:01:58.649> they're<00:01:58.829> going<00:01:59.040> out<00:01:59.130> of

00:01:59.209 --> 00:01:59.219 
they're going if they're going out of

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:01.280 
they're going if they're going out of
range<00:01:59.659> anyways<00:02:00.659> it's<00:02:00.810> very<00:02:00.990> small<00:02:01.229> very

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:01.290 
range anyways it's very small very

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:04.370 
range anyways it's very small very
lightweight<00:02:01.590> very<00:02:02.100> cheap<00:02:03.030> and<00:02:03.240> small<00:02:03.930> system

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:04.380 
lightweight very cheap and small system

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:06.859 
lightweight very cheap and small system
so<00:02:05.280> that's<00:02:05.490> the<00:02:05.670> premise<00:02:05.909> the<00:02:06.210> rise<00:02:06.329> on<00:02:06.360> paper

00:02:06.859 --> 00:02:06.869 
so that's the premise the rise on paper

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:08.900 
so that's the premise the rise on paper
again<00:02:07.350> the<00:02:07.409> beep<00:02:07.560> is<00:02:07.710> quite<00:02:07.920> loud<00:02:08.069> once<00:02:08.670> I<00:02:08.729> line

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:08.910 
again the beep is quite loud once I line

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:10.279 
again the beep is quite loud once I line
up<00:02:08.940> with<00:02:09.270> it<00:02:09.300> that<00:02:09.599> beep<00:02:09.720> is<00:02:09.840> gonna<00:02:09.989> stop

00:02:10.279 --> 00:02:10.289 
up with it that beep is gonna stop

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:11.660 
up with it that beep is gonna stop
because<00:02:10.649> I'm<00:02:10.800> ready<00:02:11.009> in<00:02:11.129> rain

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:11.670 
because I'm ready in rain

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:13.700 
because I'm ready in rain
and<00:02:11.790> it<00:02:12.000> knows<00:02:12.150> that<00:02:12.210> it's<00:02:12.450> in<00:02:12.600> range<00:02:12.900> however

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:13.710 
and it knows that it's in range however

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:15.170 
and it knows that it's in range however
in<00:02:13.950> practice<00:02:14.490> we<00:02:14.640> did<00:02:14.820> find<00:02:15.060> that

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:15.180 
in practice we did find that

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:17.510 
in practice we did find that
unfortunately<00:02:15.900> device<00:02:16.170> wasn't<00:02:16.680> as<00:02:16.800> easy<00:02:17.370> to

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:17.520 
unfortunately device wasn't as easy to

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:20.270 
unfortunately device wasn't as easy to
use<00:02:17.670> as<00:02:17.880> the<00:02:18.660> device<00:02:18.900> was<00:02:19.260> you<00:02:19.980> know<00:02:20.070> supposed

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:20.280 
use as the device was you know supposed

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:23.660 
use as the device was you know supposed
to<00:02:20.730> be<00:02:21.890> and<00:02:22.890> this<00:02:23.040> is<00:02:23.190> really<00:02:23.310> because

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:23.670 
to be and this is really because

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:25.670 
to be and this is really because
although<00:02:24.450> you<00:02:24.630> can<00:02:24.840> locate<00:02:24.960> where<00:02:25.320> the<00:02:25.470> device

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:25.680 
although you can locate where the device

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:27.770 
although you can locate where the device
is<00:02:25.920> after<00:02:26.280> you<00:02:26.370> lose<00:02:26.610> it<00:02:26.820> you<00:02:27.210> can't<00:02:27.450> find<00:02:27.690> the

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:27.780 
is after you lose it you can't find the

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:30.290 
is after you lose it you can't find the
exact<00:02:28.140> location<00:02:28.230> very<00:02:28.800> well<00:02:29.010> the<00:02:29.730> sensor<00:02:30.060> on

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:30.300 
exact location very well the sensor on

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:31.820 
exact location very well the sensor on
here<00:02:30.630> which<00:02:30.810> is<00:02:30.840> kind<00:02:31.140> of<00:02:31.170> a<00:02:31.260> line<00:02:31.470> with<00:02:31.680> this

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:31.830 
here which is kind of a line with this

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:33.560 
here which is kind of a line with this
device<00:02:32.070> and<00:02:32.280> stop<00:02:32.430> beeping<00:02:32.820> is<00:02:33.150> sometimes<00:02:33.510> a

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:33.570 
device and stop beeping is sometimes a

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:35.570 
device and stop beeping is sometimes a
little<00:02:33.600> bit<00:02:33.810> finicky<00:02:33.990> so<00:02:34.440> if<00:02:34.590> you're<00:02:34.740> for

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:35.580 
little bit finicky so if you're for

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:37.340 
little bit finicky so if you're for
example<00:02:35.640> if<00:02:36.060> you're<00:02:36.180> a<00:02:36.210> two<00:02:36.690> feet<00:02:36.900> away<00:02:37.020> it's

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:37.350 
example if you're a two feet away it's

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:38.540 
example if you're a two feet away it's
not<00:02:37.470> going<00:02:37.620> to<00:02:37.680> know<00:02:37.800> that<00:02:37.830> the<00:02:38.310> device<00:02:38.520> is

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:38.550 
not going to know that the device is

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:40.070 
not going to know that the device is
actually<00:02:39.000> there<00:02:39.270> and<00:02:39.420> sometimes<00:02:39.600> if<00:02:39.840> the<00:02:39.930> come

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:40.080 
actually there and sometimes if the come

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:42.110 
actually there and sometimes if the come
in<00:02:40.200> contact<00:02:40.440> with<00:02:40.770> it<00:02:40.980> once<00:02:41.430> the<00:02:41.640> device<00:02:41.820> start

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:42.120 
in contact with it once the device start

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:43.790 
in contact with it once the device start
stops<00:02:42.420> beeping<00:02:43.170> so<00:02:43.350> if<00:02:43.440> you<00:02:43.530> wanna<00:02:43.650> know<00:02:43.740> the

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:43.800 
stops beeping so if you wanna know the

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:45.290 
stops beeping so if you wanna know the
exact<00:02:44.190> location<00:02:44.640> of<00:02:44.700> perhaps<00:02:45.000> lost

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:51.740 
it's you know it's not gonna give you
the<00:02:50.340> exact<00:02:50.760> location<00:02:50.850> so<00:02:51.300> it<00:02:51.360> can<00:02:51.480> give<00:02:51.630> you<00:02:51.720> a

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:51.750 
the exact location so it can give you a

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:53.360 
the exact location so it can give you a
rough<00:02:51.960> idea<00:02:52.140> of<00:02:52.320> where<00:02:52.500> you<00:02:52.650> are<00:02:52.680> and<00:02:53.220> also

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:53.370 
rough idea of where you are and also

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:55.370 
rough idea of where you are and also
this<00:02:53.640> isn't<00:02:53.910> like<00:02:54.000> a<00:02:54.030> GPS<00:02:54.510> system<00:02:54.900> where<00:02:55.290> you

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:55.380 
this isn't like a GPS system where you

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:56.780 
this isn't like a GPS system where you
can<00:02:55.500> know<00:02:55.590> on<00:02:55.710> the<00:02:55.800> map<00:02:55.980> worth<00:02:56.250> something<00:02:56.640> is

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:56.790 
can know on the map worth something is

00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:58.160 
can know on the map worth something is
so<00:02:57.240> it's<00:02:57.360> not<00:02:57.390> gonna<00:02:57.540> be<00:02:57.630> that<00:02:57.690> accurate

00:02:58.160 --> 00:02:58.170 
so it's not gonna be that accurate

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:00.170 
so it's not gonna be that accurate
either<00:02:58.380> but<00:02:58.950> so<00:02:59.130> it<00:02:59.460> is<00:02:59.580> a<00:02:59.610> pretty<00:03:00.000> useful

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:00.180 
either but so it is a pretty useful

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:01.670 
either but so it is a pretty useful
application<00:03:00.750> especially<00:03:00.930> if<00:03:01.230> you<00:03:01.320> are
