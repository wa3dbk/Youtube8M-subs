look at the drivers I'm not sure if you

00:02:04.679 --> 00:02:06.559 
look at the drivers I'm not sure if you
can<00:02:04.709> see<00:02:04.829> the<00:02:05.099> quality<00:02:05.310> but<00:02:06.060> on<00:02:06.239> here<00:02:06.450> there's

00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:07.470 
little divides me of a little bit of

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:12.050 
little divides me of a little bit of
Hibiki<00:03:08.960> but<00:03:09.960> yeah<00:03:10.410> so<00:03:10.620> that's<00:03:10.830> the<00:03:11.040> new<00:03:11.760> sound

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:16.310 
in the driver I can't get the other lock
seed<00:03:14.880> noises<00:03:15.360> because<00:03:15.540> well<00:03:15.840> you<00:03:16.050> need<00:03:16.200> the

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:16.320 
seed noises because well you need the

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:17.930 
seed noises because well you need the
extra<00:03:16.560> lot<00:03:16.800> so<00:03:16.980> you<00:03:17.010> can't<00:03:17.370> do<00:03:17.550> that<00:03:17.670> on<00:03:17.730> the

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:17.940 
extra lot so you can't do that on the

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:20.480 
extra lot so you can't do that on the
driver<00:03:18.180> but<00:03:19.050> so<00:03:19.230> that's<00:03:19.440> all<00:03:19.620> that<00:03:19.650> for<00:03:20.040> now<00:03:20.130> so
