my<00:02:26.959> 8048<00:02:27.860> LTS<00:02:28.520> tires<00:02:28.819> which<00:02:29.360> will<00:02:29.660> be

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:29.810 
my 8048 LTS tires which will be

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:33.010 
my 8048 LTS tires which will be
extremely<00:02:30.440> sticky<00:02:31.010> so<00:02:31.370> on<00:02:31.640> this<00:02:32.360> car<00:02:32.660> will<00:02:32.870> be

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:33.020 
extremely sticky so on this car will be

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:35.860 
extremely sticky so on this car will be
a<00:02:33.050> great<00:02:33.470> handling<00:02:33.950> car<00:02:34.010> like<00:02:34.520> the<00:02:35.209> tires<00:02:35.630> will

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:35.870 
a great handling car like the tires will

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:38.140 
a great handling car like the tires will
be<00:02:35.900> great<00:02:36.170> but<00:02:36.350> also<00:02:36.560> the<00:02:37.340> ride<00:02:37.550> height<00:02:37.760> Sloane

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:38.150 
be great but also the ride height Sloane

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:39.940 
be great but also the ride height Sloane
it's<00:02:38.450> really<00:02:38.630> wide<00:02:38.990> and<00:02:39.380> its<00:02:39.530> really<00:02:39.680> light

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:39.950 
it's really wide and its really light

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:42.010 
it's really wide and its really light
you<00:02:40.250> got<00:02:40.400> that<00:02:40.520> big<00:02:40.760> wing<00:02:41.030> for<00:02:41.270> downforce<00:02:41.750> so<00:02:41.959> I

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:42.020 
you got that big wing for downforce so I

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:43.960 
you got that big wing for downforce so I
think<00:02:42.110> this<00:02:42.440> thing<00:02:42.650> will<00:02:42.800> go<00:02:43.459> around<00:02:43.670> corners

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:43.970 
think this thing will go around corners

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:50.140 
think this thing will go around corners
extremely<00:02:44.690> well<00:02:44.900> uh<00:02:46.480> this<00:02:47.480> car<00:02:47.890> will<00:02:48.890> only<00:02:49.819> see

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:50.150 
extremely well uh this car will only see

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:51.960 
extremely well uh this car will only see
two<00:02:50.330> people<00:02:50.569> obviously<00:02:50.870> because<00:02:51.380> they<00:02:51.500> all<00:02:51.650> do

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:51.970 
two people obviously because they all do

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:55.330 
two people obviously because they all do
0-60<00:02:52.970> and<00:02:53.090> four<00:02:53.270> seconds<00:02:53.840> top<00:02:54.200> speed<00:02:54.340> 152

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:55.340 
0-60 and four seconds top speed 152

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:57.940 
0-60 and four seconds top speed 152
miles<00:02:55.580> an<00:02:55.819> hour<00:02:55.940> so<00:02:56.810> it's<00:02:56.959> not<00:02:57.020> really<00:02:57.080> a<00:02:57.380> it's

00:02:57.940 --> 00:02:57.950 
miles an hour so it's not really a it's

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:00.940 
miles an hour so it's not really a it's
not<00:02:58.220> an<00:02:58.430> extremely<00:02:59.330> fast<00:02:59.600> car<00:02:59.959> because<00:03:00.739> I<00:03:00.890> know

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:00.950 
not an extremely fast car because I know

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:05.259 
not an extremely fast car because I know
like<00:03:01.870> you<00:03:02.870> can<00:03:03.260> get<00:03:03.350> a<00:03:03.380> lot<00:03:03.560> of<00:03:03.620> cars<00:03:03.920> up<00:03:04.100> to<00:03:04.269> 140

00:03:05.259 --> 00:03:05.269 
like you can get a lot of cars up to 140

00:03:05.269 --> 00:03:07.900 
like you can get a lot of cars up to 140
150<00:03:05.630> these<00:03:06.050> days<00:03:06.320> well<00:03:06.800> well<00:03:07.280> Lotus<00:03:07.700> I

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:07.910 
150 these days well well Lotus I

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:10.300 
150 these days well well Lotus I
wouldn't<00:03:08.720> really<00:03:08.840> use<00:03:09.110> Lotus<00:03:09.650> farhat<00:03:09.950> high

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:10.310 
wouldn't really use Lotus farhat high

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:12.759 
wouldn't really use Lotus farhat high
top<00:03:10.550> speed<00:03:10.850> Carl<00:03:11.090> Otis<00:03:11.209> are<00:03:11.450> usually<00:03:11.780> uh<00:03:11.810> I'd

00:03:12.759 --> 00:03:12.769 
top speed Carl Otis are usually uh I'd

00:03:12.769 --> 00:03:14.949 
top speed Carl Otis are usually uh I'd
use<00:03:12.950> a<00:03:12.980> lotus<00:03:13.340> for<00:03:13.519> like<00:03:13.610> a<00:03:13.660> small<00:03:14.660> tight

00:03:14.949 --> 00:03:14.959 
use a lotus for like a small tight

00:03:14.959 --> 00:03:16.420 
use a lotus for like a small tight
circuit<00:03:15.380> track<00:03:15.620> racing<00:03:16.010> or<00:03:16.130> something<00:03:16.370> like

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:16.430 
circuit track racing or something like

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:18.100 
circuit track racing or something like
that<00:03:16.489> yeah<00:03:17.360> I<00:03:17.390> think<00:03:17.540> that's<00:03:17.840> what<00:03:17.989> they're

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:18.110 
that yeah I think that's what they're

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:21.940 
that yeah I think that's what they're
really<00:03:18.290> made<00:03:18.560> for<00:03:18.860> because<00:03:19.730> um<00:03:20.769> yeah<00:03:21.769> I

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:21.950 
really made for because um yeah I

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:24.070 
really made for because um yeah I
wouldn't<00:03:22.310> yeah<00:03:22.910> it's<00:03:23.120> definitely<00:03:23.330> can't<00:03:23.840> cut

00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:24.080 
wouldn't yeah it's definitely can't cut

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:26.620 
wouldn't yeah it's definitely can't cut
you<00:03:24.260> can't<00:03:24.500> compare<00:03:25.160> it<00:03:25.340> to<00:03:25.459> like<00:03:25.489> a<00:03:25.670> Corvette

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:26.630 
you can't compare it to like a Corvette

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:28.330 
you can't compare it to like a Corvette
or<00:03:26.870> something<00:03:27.230> like<00:03:27.290> that<00:03:27.350> because<00:03:27.650> I<00:03:27.920> mean<00:03:28.130> it

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:28.340 
or something like that because I mean it

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:30.250 
or something like that because I mean it
would<00:03:28.850> smoke<00:03:29.090> a<00:03:29.150> Corvette<00:03:29.660> around<00:03:29.930> a<00:03:30.019> corner

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:30.260 
would smoke a Corvette around a corner

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:33.699 
would smoke a Corvette around a corner
well<00:03:30.829> yeah<00:03:31.160> and<00:03:31.870> you<00:03:32.870> need<00:03:33.079> the<00:03:33.530> more

00:03:33.699 --> 00:03:33.709 
well yeah and you need the more

00:03:33.709 --> 00:03:35.170 
well yeah and you need the more
horsepower<00:03:34.130> that<00:03:34.160> you<00:03:34.459> have<00:03:34.640> thought<00:03:34.910> the

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:35.180 
horsepower that you have thought the

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:37.810 
horsepower that you have thought the
higher<00:03:35.360> top<00:03:35.570> speed<00:03:35.600> and<00:03:36.610> lotuses<00:03:37.610> aren't

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:37.820 
higher top speed and lotuses aren't

00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:39.160 
higher top speed and lotuses aren't
really<00:03:37.970> made<00:03:38.150> for<00:03:38.299> high<00:03:38.450> horsepower<00:03:38.780> and

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:39.170 
really made for high horsepower and

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:41.380 
really made for high horsepower and
their<00:03:39.769> bodies<00:03:39.950> are<00:03:40.130> light<00:03:40.400> so<00:03:40.610> the<00:03:40.730> wind<00:03:40.970> the

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:41.390 
their bodies are light so the wind the

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:43.000 
their bodies are light so the wind the
wind<00:03:41.600> drag<00:03:41.840> is<00:03:41.989> going<00:03:42.140> to<00:03:42.230> affect<00:03:42.470> it<00:03:42.620> more<00:03:42.799> as

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:43.010 
wind drag is going to affect it more as

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:44.890 
wind drag is going to affect it more as
well<00:03:43.250> so<00:03:43.579> it<00:03:44.060> just<00:03:44.239> don't<00:03:44.299> have<00:03:44.510> enough<00:03:44.600> power

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:44.900 
well so it just don't have enough power

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:47.710 
well so it just don't have enough power
and<00:03:45.320> wait<00:03:45.680> to<00:03:45.920> get<00:03:46.040> it<00:03:46.160> up<00:03:46.310> to<00:03:46.340> top<00:03:47.269> speeds<00:03:47.570> like

00:03:47.710 --> 00:03:47.720 
and wait to get it up to top speeds like

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:50.050 
and wait to get it up to top speeds like
other<00:03:47.900> high<00:03:48.440> power<00:03:48.680> cars<00:03:48.950> yeah<00:03:49.640> that's<00:03:49.880> right

00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:50.060 
other high power cars yeah that's right

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:52.060 
other high power cars yeah that's right
because<00:03:50.209> the<00:03:50.540> whole<00:03:50.959> outsides<00:03:51.410> just<00:03:51.739> a<00:03:51.829> big

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:52.070 
because the whole outsides just a big

00:03:52.070 --> 00:03:55.060 
because the whole outsides just a big
carbon<00:03:52.519> fiber<00:03:52.700> shell<00:03:53.030> actually<00:03:53.329> yeah<00:03:53.959> so<00:03:54.680> that

00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:55.070 
carbon fiber shell actually yeah so that

00:03:55.070 --> 00:03:57.280 
carbon fiber shell actually yeah so that
there<00:03:55.280> really<00:03:55.430> is<00:03:55.670> no<00:03:55.910> wait<00:03:56.120> to<00:03:56.299> speak<00:03:56.540> of<00:03:56.810> yeah

00:03:57.280 --> 00:03:57.290 
there really is no wait to speak of yeah

00:03:57.290 --> 00:04:00.250 
there really is no wait to speak of yeah
oh<00:03:57.590> no<00:03:58.579> that's<00:03:58.790> that's<00:03:59.120> all<00:03:59.359> I<00:03:59.390> got<00:03:59.720> you<00:04:00.079> want

the<00:04:07.700> last<00:04:07.880> review<00:04:08.239> we<00:04:08.329> did<00:04:08.450> the<00:04:08.540> corvette

00:04:09.009 --> 00:04:09.019 
the last review we did the corvette

00:04:09.019 --> 00:04:10.569 
the last review we did the corvette
didn't<00:04:09.440> really<00:04:09.620> like<00:04:09.739> the<00:04:09.769> interior<00:04:10.280> but<00:04:10.519> the

00:04:10.569 --> 00:04:10.579 
didn't really like the interior but the

00:04:10.579 --> 00:04:15.009 
didn't really like the interior but the
lotus<00:04:10.820> elise<00:04:12.880> they<00:04:13.880> make<00:04:14.090> it<00:04:14.239> for<00:04:14.269> lightweight

00:04:15.009 --> 00:04:15.019 
lotus elise they make it for lightweight

00:04:15.019 --> 00:04:18.430 
lotus elise they make it for lightweight
so<00:04:15.470> you<00:04:16.400> know<00:04:16.519> it's<00:04:17.090> more<00:04:17.299> it<00:04:17.870> looks<00:04:18.079> more<00:04:18.169> like

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:18.440 
so you know it's more it looks more like

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:20.650 
so you know it's more it looks more like
a<00:04:18.470> racing<00:04:19.459> style<00:04:19.760> car<00:04:20.030> what's<00:04:20.269> like<00:04:20.390> the<00:04:20.419> know

00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:20.660 
a racing style car what's like the know

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:22.300 
a racing style car what's like the know
with<00:04:20.989> no<00:04:21.140> interior<00:04:21.470> on<00:04:21.709> the<00:04:21.799> inside<00:04:22.039> and<00:04:22.160> stuff

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:22.310 
with no interior on the inside and stuff

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:25.270 
with no interior on the inside and stuff
but<00:04:22.610> I<00:04:23.120> like<00:04:23.750> the<00:04:23.780> simplicity<00:04:24.050> of<00:04:24.500> it<00:04:24.710> and<00:04:24.890> I

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:25.280 
but I like the simplicity of it and I

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:26.469 
but I like the simplicity of it and I
like<00:04:25.460> how<00:04:25.580> the<00:04:25.640> Lotus<00:04:25.970> doesn't<00:04:26.270> really<00:04:26.390> change

00:04:26.469 --> 00:04:26.479 
like how the Lotus doesn't really change

00:04:26.479 --> 00:04:28.300 
like how the Lotus doesn't really change
their<00:04:26.960> body<00:04:27.169> style<00:04:27.500> on<00:04:27.620> the<00:04:27.710> Lotus<00:04:27.919> Elise<00:04:28.130> they

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:28.310 
their body style on the Lotus Elise they

00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:30.100 
their body style on the Lotus Elise they
always<00:04:28.460> keep<00:04:28.610> it<00:04:28.729> nice<00:04:28.820> nice<00:04:29.570> and<00:04:29.810> the<00:04:29.870> same

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:30.110 
always keep it nice nice and the same

00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:33.040 
always keep it nice nice and the same
and<00:04:30.950> they<00:04:31.160> just<00:04:31.310> add<00:04:31.430> different<00:04:31.900> editions<00:04:32.900> on

00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:33.050 
and they just add different editions on

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:35.080 
and they just add different editions on
to<00:04:33.229> it<00:04:33.380> and<00:04:33.530> I<00:04:33.590> like<00:04:34.340> to<00:04:34.460> I<00:04:34.490> like<00:04:34.700> the<00:04:34.909> body

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:35.090 
to it and I like to I like the body

00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:37.240 
to it and I like to I like the body
style<00:04:35.180> of<00:04:35.539> the<00:04:35.659> lotus<00:04:35.810> elise<00:04:36.169> currently<00:04:37.039> and

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:37.250 
style of the lotus elise currently and

00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:38.529 
style of the lotus elise currently and
that's<00:04:37.760> like<00:04:37.909> I<00:04:38.000> should<00:04:38.150> keep<00:04:38.240> it<00:04:38.360> that<00:04:38.479> way

00:04:38.529 --> 00:04:38.539 
that's like I should keep it that way

00:04:38.539 --> 00:04:41.020 
that's like I should keep it that way
and<00:04:39.409> it<00:04:40.039> looks<00:04:40.099> like<00:04:40.280> they<00:04:40.460> will

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:41.030 
and it looks like they will

00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:42.790 
and it looks like they will
carry<00:04:41.180> it<00:04:41.300> right<00:04:41.390> into<00:04:41.660> the<00:04:41.780> exige<00:04:42.140> platform

00:04:42.790 --> 00:04:42.800
