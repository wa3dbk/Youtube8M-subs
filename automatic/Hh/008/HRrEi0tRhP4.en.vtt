00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:04.620
 hello everyone how are 

00:00:03.389 --> 00:00:05.879
 welcome to one more episode here in 

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:08.180
 draw and create that speaks to them of milton 

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:11.820
 core and this time we are drawing 

00:00:08.180 --> 00:00:13.019
 homero simpson and good is a character 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:14.639
 I wanted to draw for days because of 

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:16.350
 everything they had asked for me already 

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:18.120
 Many days I had asked for this 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:19.260
 drawing and then good is a video that does not 

00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:20.820
 may be missing in the channel because 

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:21.450
 well they are still a very very character 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:23.880
 very popular 

00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:25.800
 too popular and we all know it 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:28.140
 true then these simple drawings 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:30.030
 sometimes they seem to get a little more complicated 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:32.669
 then I was getting complicated 

00:00:30.030 --> 00:00:34.710
 location of the eyes and finally but 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:37.500
 well I did a circumference in the 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:40.499
 top and then move it towards 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:43.620
 down towards straight to the 

00:00:40.499 --> 00:00:45.269
 neck and at the bottom of the 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:46.949
 circumference locate the eyes more or 

00:00:45.269 --> 00:00:50.370
 less are eyes placed and 

00:00:46.949 --> 00:00:51.870
 then trying to do well the way 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:55.499
 mouth by mouth say it's a 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:57.690
 big area that has beard then that 

00:00:55.499 --> 00:01:00.239
 area is about the size of the 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:01.769
 front of the ok we can say that the 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:04.680
 size of the forehead the size of a 

00:01:01.769 --> 00:01:07.260
 little smaller than the part of the 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:08.070
 head and so I managed to get the figure 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:10.770
 of humerus 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:12.479
 again then the sketch so what 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:14.760
 I'm doing with a pencil hb like 

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:17.700
 always and now let's give it a little 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:19.120
 color with premium color pencils 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:22.720
 colour 

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:26.230
 and we're going to make the link in to delineate what 

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:30.100
 with a sakura this is a micro tip 

00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:32.120
 sakura is a sakura micro inc 

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:34.190
 is called 

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:37.430
 it's very good quality it's very economical 

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:41.000
 as I said this is a 0.8 is a 

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:42.920
 pretty thick and good mine 

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:45.020
 is own and stops for this I say 

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:47.600
 because with this homero is the same 

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:50.300
 generate especially since it has the 

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:52.610
 quite thick edges then to the 

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:54.770
 time to delineate with this micro tip 

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:56.690
 well, we should take a little care of 

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:59.330
 do it with a firm pulse and doing it 

00:01:56.690 --> 00:02:02.480
 very well because then what we already draw 

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:04.010
 with a micro tip with this ink is already 

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:06.500
 impossible to erase it we could no longer 

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:08.540
 erase it so we must have very good 

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:09.890
 pulse and do it very carefully and with 

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:14.950
 firm strokes 

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:14.950
 here we are delineating the whole drawing and 

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:20.570
 well what we are going to do is also 

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:22.850
 Give him some shadows and make him some 

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:24.530
 highlights ok then here we go 

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:26.870
 finishing delineating what is the 

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:27.880
 drawing homero simpson we are doing 

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:30.590
 the details 

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:33.350
 Finally the hair the two hairs 

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:35.810
 that are left and well we erase we erase 

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:37.490
 all the pencil so that we go 

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:39.050
 stain when we apply the color and 

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:40.550
 good that we are applying a pencil 

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:42.640
 yellow color prismacolor this is a 

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:45.950
 yellow this is like orange this is a 

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:48.800
 like a yellow like an orange tone 

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:53.180
 good at school in the name of the pencil 

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:54.470
 color is an orange ok then that 

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:56.260
 is more or less the color more 

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:58.760
 seemed like I had homero simpson 

00:02:56.260 --> 00:03:00.770
 so I decided to do it with this color 

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:03.560
 there we are doing everything and in this 

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:04.790
 part was applied an ocher for the part of 

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:07.520
 the beard but the beard of you are a little 

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:10.490
 clearer and he applied this ocher of 

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:12.860
 uniform form and now he applied 

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:15.380
 cream color to clarify a bit already 

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:19.790
 that I do not have the color 

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:22.670
 the exact color of the part of the 

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:24.560
 homerous chin then part of 

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:26.840
 the mouth not then here dark with one 

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:31.130
 create one believes darker and I do the 

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:34.060
 shadows and the background a little bit with the 

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:37.540
 cream color that look a bit 

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:43.310
 natural and here I am also applying 

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:44.870
 the shadows of the head with a pencil 

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:47.030
 ocher I'm also doing on the 

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:50.540
 yellow means that as the pencil 

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:52.670
 ocher no no no does not cover at all but 

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:54.380
 generates a shadow then I take advantage 

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:56.090
 for that we make the shadow in front and the 

00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:59.480
 shadow of the eyes 

00:03:56.090 --> 00:04:01.670
 and the fingers now with this pencil 

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:05.060
 gray color that is a gray pencil 

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:07.250
 bling studio brand are very good is 

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:10.760
 very good this excellent bling pencils 

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:12.410
 and good with this gray color I'm giving a 

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:13.610
 little of everything give us a bit of shadows to 

00:04:12.410 --> 00:04:15.799
 what the shirt is for them to do is 

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:17.120
 white and to the eyes that are also 

00:04:15.799 --> 00:04:19.170
 whites then give a little bit of 

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:20.940
 volume to the eyes 

00:04:19.170 --> 00:04:23.490
 here you can invent a little 

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:26.110
 shadows of the hair here we finish 

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:28.780
 to render what the donut is 

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:31.630
 with a little chocolate color a color 

00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:35.580
 ocher and a little color 

00:04:31.630 --> 00:04:38.180
 and purple and red very typical then of 

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:41.550
 of the colors of the dunes here and 

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:44.689
 enhanced the drawing with highlights and 

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:47.340
 I'm doing with acrylic paint 

00:04:44.689 --> 00:04:48.990
 liquid text ok then the paint 

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:52.680
 acrylic is a color pretty much a 

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:54.060
 I made a fan color mixing a 

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:56.340
 little bit of white with a little 

00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:58.259
 Well this is yellow and has been all 

00:04:56.340 --> 00:05:01.349
