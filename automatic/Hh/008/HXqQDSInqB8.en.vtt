00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:17.810 
RAM will vary you get in four or eight
gigabyte<00:01:15.960> options<00:01:16.530> so<00:01:16.740> a<00:01:16.950> lot<00:01:17.310> to<00:01:17.460> choose<00:01:17.610> from

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
gigabyte options so a lot to choose from

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:20.060 
gigabyte options so a lot to choose from
but<00:01:18.000> it's<00:01:18.479> very<00:01:18.600> nice<00:01:18.840> because<00:01:19.080> it's<00:01:19.290> for<00:01:19.950> the

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.070 
but it's very nice because it's for the

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:22.789 
but it's very nice because it's for the
most<00:01:20.189> part<00:01:20.490> pretty<00:01:20.759> thin<00:01:21.080> then<00:01:22.080> left<00:01:22.409> in<00:01:22.770> a

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:22.799 
most part pretty thin then left in a

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:25.870 
most part pretty thin then left in a
tablet<00:01:23.520> and<00:01:24.420> when<00:01:24.630> combined<00:01:24.990> it<00:01:25.170> with<00:01:25.200> the

00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:25.880 
tablet and when combined it with the

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:27.950 
tablet and when combined it with the
included<00:01:26.880> keyboard<00:01:27.270> dock<00:01:27.420> you<00:01:27.659> get<00:01:27.780> some

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960 
included keyboard dock you get some

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:30.249 
included keyboard dock you get some
versatility<00:01:28.470> so<00:01:29.070> it<00:01:29.250> becomes<00:01:29.579> like<00:01:29.880> a<00:01:29.909> regular

00:01:30.249 --> 00:01:30.259 
versatility so it becomes like a regular

00:01:30.259 --> 00:01:32.690 
versatility so it becomes like a regular
regular<00:01:31.259> laptop<00:01:31.470> and<00:01:31.950> the<00:01:32.009> way<00:01:32.130> that<00:01:32.310> you

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
regular laptop and the way that you

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:34.730 
regular laptop and the way that you
could<00:01:32.850> type<00:01:33.090> and<00:01:33.420> you<00:01:34.079> know<00:01:34.200> or<00:01:34.439> use<00:01:34.619> it

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740 
could type and you know or use it

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:36.920 
could type and you know or use it
independently<00:01:35.310> now<00:01:35.880> it's<00:01:36.299> a<00:01:36.630> magnetic

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930 
independently now it's a magnetic

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:39.260 
independently now it's a magnetic
connection<00:01:37.490> it's<00:01:38.490> all<00:01:38.610> you<00:01:38.700> had<00:01:38.790> to<00:01:38.820> just<00:01:39.060> snap

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270 
connection it's all you had to just snap

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:41.330 
connection it's all you had to just snap
it<00:01:39.420> in<00:01:39.509> place<00:01:39.590> pretty<00:01:40.590> started<00:01:40.950> for<00:01:41.100> the<00:01:41.159> most

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 
it in place pretty started for the most

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:43.460 
it in place pretty started for the most
part<00:01:41.670> you<00:01:42.240> can't<00:01:42.509> extend<00:01:42.780> it<00:01:42.899> all<00:01:43.020> the<00:01:43.049> way<00:01:43.229> but

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:43.470 
part you can't extend it all the way but

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:46.310 
part you can't extend it all the way but
you<00:01:43.590> could<00:01:43.680> close<00:01:43.950> it<00:01:44.159> and<00:01:44.579> at<00:01:45.299> 12<00:01:45.600> F<00:01:45.780> twenty

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:46.320 
you could close it and at 12 F twenty

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:48.710 
you could close it and at 12 F twenty
twelve<00:01:46.680> and<00:01:46.860> a<00:01:46.979> half<00:01:47.009> inches<00:01:47.430> it's<00:01:48.060> a<00:01:48.149> POC<00:01:48.509> you

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:48.720 
twelve and a half inches it's a POC you

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:51.560 
twelve and a half inches it's a POC you
might<00:01:48.899> up<00:01:49.200> by<00:01:49.470> a<00:01:49.500> whole<00:01:49.680> lot<00:01:49.979> of<00:01:50.100> space<00:01:50.490> no<00:01:51.299> it's

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:51.570 
might up by a whole lot of space no it's

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:53.899 
might up by a whole lot of space no it's
I<00:01:51.810> wouldn't<00:01:52.140> say<00:01:52.229> it's<00:01:52.409> not<00:01:52.799> as<00:01:53.040> thin<00:01:53.520> compared

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:53.909 
I wouldn't say it's not as thin compared
