00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:16.369 
won't see in other videos so let's get
started<00:00:14.849> you<00:00:15.420> start<00:00:15.660> off<00:00:15.750> with<00:00:16.020> 6<00:00:16.230> snowballs

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:16.379 
started you start off with 6 snowballs

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:19.400 
started you start off with 6 snowballs
but<00:00:17.369> if<00:00:17.550> you<00:00:17.699> spawn<00:00:18.090> in<00:00:18.330> any<00:00:18.570> kind<00:00:18.869> of<00:00:18.990> snow

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:19.410 
but if you spawn in any kind of snow

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:21.230 
but if you spawn in any kind of snow
bomb<00:00:19.650> that<00:00:19.920> i<00:00:19.980> suggest<00:00:20.400> you<00:00:20.520> make<00:00:20.760> a<00:00:20.820> shovel

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:21.240 
bomb that i suggest you make a shovel

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:23.570 
bomb that i suggest you make a shovel
and<00:00:21.390> get<00:00:21.869> as<00:00:22.020> many<00:00:22.199> snowballs<00:00:22.350> as<00:00:23.010> you<00:00:23.340> can

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:23.580 
and get as many snowballs as you can

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:25.790

carry<00:00:23.880> this<00:00:24.449> kid<00:00:24.720> is<00:00:24.750> not<00:00:25.019> that<00:00:25.289> good<00:00:25.500> if<00:00:25.680> you

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:25.800 
carry this kid is not that good if you

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:27.830 
carry this kid is not that good if you
are<00:00:25.949> chasing<00:00:26.220> after<00:00:26.550> someone<00:00:26.939> because<00:00:27.480> if<00:00:27.689> you

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:27.840 
are chasing after someone because if you

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:29.509 
are chasing after someone because if you
try<00:00:28.080> and<00:00:28.199> throw<00:00:28.410> a<00:00:28.439> snowball<00:00:28.740> at<00:00:29.010> them<00:00:29.220> it<00:00:29.429> will

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:29.519 
try and throw a snowball at them it will

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:31.609 
try and throw a snowball at them it will
just<00:00:29.730> push<00:00:30.060> them<00:00:30.300> forward<00:00:30.480> and<00:00:30.869> then<00:00:31.349> you

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:31.619 
just push them forward and then you

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:33.830 
just push them forward and then you
might<00:00:31.890> accidentally<00:00:32.460> walk<00:00:32.910> into<00:00:33.300> the<00:00:33.390> cobweb

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:33.840 
might accidentally walk into the cobweb

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:35.959 
might accidentally walk into the cobweb
yourself<00:00:34.320> so<00:00:34.739> what<00:00:34.860> you<00:00:34.950> guys<00:00:35.130> are<00:00:35.670> going<00:00:35.880> to

00:00:35.959 --> 00:00:35.969 
yourself so what you guys are going to

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:38.060 
yourself so what you guys are going to
try<00:00:36.329> and<00:00:36.480> do<00:00:36.840> is<00:00:37.140> throw<00:00:37.440> the<00:00:37.469> snowball<00:00:37.920> in

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:38.070 
try and do is throw the snowball in

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:39.889 
try and do is throw the snowball in
front<00:00:38.340> of<00:00:38.399> them<00:00:38.489> so<00:00:38.760> they<00:00:38.910> walk<00:00:39.180> into<00:00:39.480> the

00:00:39.889 --> 00:00:39.899 
front of them so they walk into the

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:43.369 
front of them so they walk into the
cobweb<00:00:40.350> but<00:00:41.160> that<00:00:41.520> is<00:00:41.730> very<00:00:42.090> hard<00:00:42.329> to<00:00:42.450> do<00:00:42.629> it's

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379 
cobweb but that is very hard to do it's

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:45.020 
cobweb but that is very hard to do it's
mainly<00:00:43.710> good<00:00:44.070> if<00:00:44.219> you<00:00:44.370> were<00:00:44.489> trying<00:00:44.730> to<00:00:44.850> run

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030 
mainly good if you were trying to run

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:46.400 
mainly good if you were trying to run
away<00:00:45.059> and<00:00:45.450> you're<00:00:45.570> trying<00:00:45.719> to<00:00:45.809> buy<00:00:46.020> yourself

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410 
away and you're trying to buy yourself

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:48.979 
away and you're trying to buy yourself
some<00:00:46.620> time<00:00:46.829> so<00:00:47.670> if<00:00:47.820> someone<00:00:48.059> is<00:00:48.420> running<00:00:48.629> in<00:00:48.899> a

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
some time so if someone is running in a

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:51.110 
some time so if someone is running in a
straight<00:00:49.469> line<00:00:49.710> right<00:00:50.219> towards<00:00:50.579> you<00:00:50.730> you<00:00:50.910> know

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 
straight line right towards you you know

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:53.090 
straight line right towards you you know
where<00:00:51.329> they're<00:00:51.449> gonna<00:00:51.510> run<00:00:51.809> so<00:00:52.500> just<00:00:52.739> try

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
where they're gonna run so just try

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:54.740 
where they're gonna run so just try
throw<00:00:53.309> it<00:00:53.399> right<00:00:53.640> at<00:00:53.699> their<00:00:53.969> feet<00:00:54.270> and<00:00:54.600> they

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750 
throw it right at their feet and they

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:56.299 
throw it right at their feet and they
get<00:00:54.930> stuck<00:00:55.260> right<00:00:55.590> in<00:00:55.620> the<00:00:55.829> middle<00:00:56.010> of<00:00:56.160> it

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
get stuck right in the middle of it

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:58.729 
get stuck right in the middle of it
unfortunately<00:00:56.489> there<00:00:57.449> is<00:00:57.629> a<00:00:57.660> 30<00:00:58.230> second

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
unfortunately there is a 30 second

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:00.920 
unfortunately there is a 30 second
cooldown<00:00:58.949> time<00:00:59.550> after<00:00:59.969> throwing<00:01:00.210> 3<00:01:00.600> snowballs

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:00.930 
cooldown time after throwing 3 snowballs

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:03.500 
cooldown time after throwing 3 snowballs
so<00:01:01.859> that's<00:01:02.309> a<00:01:02.550> pretty<00:01:02.789> long<00:01:02.879> time<00:01:03.270> in<00:01:03.420> my

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
so that's a pretty long time in my

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:05.270 
so that's a pretty long time in my
opinion<00:01:03.809> they<00:01:04.080> should<00:01:04.110> make<00:01:04.290> it<00:01:04.470> like<00:01:04.710> 15

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280 
opinion they should make it like 15

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:07.340 
opinion they should make it like 15
seconds<00:01:05.729> but<00:01:05.850> hopefully<00:01:06.570> they<00:01:06.840> will<00:01:07.020> change

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
seconds but hopefully they will change

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:09.800 
seconds but hopefully they will change
it<00:01:07.530> it's<00:01:08.250> important<00:01:08.729> that<00:01:08.880> you<00:01:08.970> know<00:01:09.210> how<00:01:09.510> long

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
it it's important that you know how long

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:12.140 
it it's important that you know how long
ago<00:01:09.990> you<00:01:10.080> threw<00:01:10.560> your<00:01:10.740> snowballs<00:01:11.280> or<00:01:11.700> how<00:01:12.090> many

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
ago you threw your snowballs or how many

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:14.270 
ago you threw your snowballs or how many
snowballs<00:01:12.750> you<00:01:12.930> have<00:01:13.080> left<00:01:13.439> to<00:01:13.530> throw<00:01:13.830> before

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
snowballs you have left to throw before

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:16.490 
snowballs you have left to throw before
the<00:01:14.400> cooldown<00:01:14.820> because<00:01:15.720> if<00:01:15.900> you<00:01:16.020> rely<00:01:16.290> on<00:01:16.350> the

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
the cooldown because if you rely on the

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:18.710 
the cooldown because if you rely on the
snowballs<00:01:16.920> too<00:01:17.189> much<00:01:17.430> like<00:01:17.729> I<00:01:17.909> show<00:01:18.390> in<00:01:18.600> the

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720 
snowballs too much like I show in the

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:20.929 
snowballs too much like I show in the
video<00:01:18.840> then<00:01:19.710> you<00:01:19.950> will<00:01:20.040> end<00:01:20.220> up<00:01:20.340> being<00:01:20.670> killed

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:20.939 
video then you will end up being killed

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:23.570 
video then you will end up being killed
another<00:01:21.900> downside<00:01:22.229> of<00:01:22.650> this<00:01:22.680> kit<00:01:23.009> is<00:01:23.189> after

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
another downside of this kit is after

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:25.850 
another downside of this kit is after
you<00:01:23.670> throw<00:01:23.939> your<00:01:24.090> 3<00:01:24.390> snowballs<00:01:24.659> you<00:01:25.530> can't

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
you throw your 3 snowballs you can't

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:27.890 
you throw your 3 snowballs you can't
throw<00:01:26.159> any<00:01:26.400> more<00:01:26.549> snowballs<00:01:26.670> even<00:01:27.630> if<00:01:27.720> they

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900 
throw any more snowballs even if they

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:30.410 
throw any more snowballs even if they
don't<00:01:28.049> turn<00:01:28.320> into<00:01:28.439> cobwebs<00:01:28.979> because<00:01:29.970> you<00:01:30.270> are

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
don't turn into cobwebs because you are

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:32.810 
don't turn into cobwebs because you are
in<00:01:30.570> the<00:01:30.720> cooldown<00:01:31.200> mode<00:01:31.229> so<00:01:32.220> unless<00:01:32.490> you<00:01:32.790> are

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820 
in the cooldown mode so unless you are

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:34.940 
in the cooldown mode so unless you are
accurate<00:01:33.420> with<00:01:33.570> your<00:01:33.689> snowballs<00:01:34.170> don't<00:01:34.650> throw

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
accurate with your snowballs don't throw

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:36.440 
accurate with your snowballs don't throw

fall into the cobwebs and then you can

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:51.059 
fall into the cobwebs and then you can
just<00:02:49.269> pound<00:02:49.599> him<00:02:49.900> while<00:02:49.930> he's<00:02:50.230> distracted<00:02:50.439> by

00:02:55.229 --> 00:02:55.239 
can even put lava underneath the cobweb

00:02:55.239 --> 00:02:57.569 
can even put lava underneath the cobweb
so<00:02:55.449> if<00:02:55.540> he<00:02:55.599> tries<00:02:55.840> to<00:02:55.870> dig<00:02:56.260> down<00:02:56.469> then<00:02:57.189> he<00:02:57.430> will

00:02:57.569 --> 00:02:57.579 
so if he tries to dig down then he will

00:02:57.579 --> 00:02:59.879 
so if he tries to dig down then he will
land<00:02:57.790> in<00:02:57.909> a<00:02:57.969> lava<00:02:58.239> that<00:02:58.629> would<00:02:58.900> be<00:02:59.049> good<00:02:59.260> for<00:02:59.620> if

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:46.900 
out of there by destroying it or just

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:49.349 
out of there by destroying it or just
trying<00:03:47.169> to<00:03:47.259> run<00:03:47.470> out<00:03:47.620> of<00:03:47.650> it<00:03:47.919> so<00:03:48.519> just<00:03:48.909> circle

around them and keep hitting them and
you<00:03:51.549> will<00:03:51.669> probably<00:03:52.030> pick<00:03:52.509> up<00:03:52.689> the<00:03:52.840> kill
