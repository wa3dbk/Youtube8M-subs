00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:28.829 
supposed to be I'm going to set it on

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:31.390 
supposed to be I'm going to set it on
that<00:01:28.890> old<00:01:29.159> pulley<00:01:29.430> keep<00:01:30.390> it<00:01:30.509> off<00:01:30.570> the<00:01:30.720> bottom

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:31.400 
that old pulley keep it off the bottom

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:33.950 
that old pulley keep it off the bottom
this<00:01:32.400> is<00:01:32.579> a<00:01:32.759> and<00:01:33.240> then<00:01:33.360> we're<00:01:33.540> going<00:01:33.659> to<00:01:33.689> run

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960 
this is a and then we're going to run

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:36.319 
this is a and then we're going to run
the<00:01:34.259> pump<00:01:34.710> into<00:01:35.009> this<00:01:35.490> this<00:01:35.700> is<00:01:35.820> an<00:01:35.970> external

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:36.329 
the pump into this this is an external

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:40.179 
the pump into this this is an external
oil<00:01:37.140> filter<00:01:37.560> housing<00:01:37.880> so<00:01:38.880> I'll<00:01:39.000> have<00:01:39.180> a<00:01:39.210> filter

00:01:40.179 --> 00:01:40.189 
oil filter housing so I'll have a filter

00:01:40.189 --> 00:01:42.920 
oil filter housing so I'll have a filter
and<00:01:41.189> I<00:01:41.400> got<00:01:41.579> to<00:01:41.670> make<00:01:41.759> another<00:01:42.000> stand<00:01:42.420> hold<00:01:42.810> the

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:42.930 
and I got to make another stand hold the

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:44.840 
and I got to make another stand hold the
barrel<00:01:43.140> hold<00:01:43.680> the<00:01:43.799> bucket<00:01:43.950> up<00:01:44.159> higher<00:01:44.189> and

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:44.850 
barrel hold the bucket up higher and

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:46.399 
barrel hold the bucket up higher and
we'll<00:01:45.329> get<00:01:45.479> all<00:01:45.600> put<00:01:45.780> together<00:01:45.899> see<00:01:46.290> how<00:01:46.350> it

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:46.409 
we'll get all put together see how it

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:50.090 
we'll get all put together see how it
looks<00:01:46.619> so<00:01:47.119> I<00:01:48.119> got<00:01:48.390> the<00:01:48.630> stand<00:01:49.350> kind<00:01:49.770> of<00:01:49.890> mocked

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100 
looks so I got the stand kind of mocked

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:52.670 
looks so I got the stand kind of mocked
up<00:01:50.310> and<00:01:50.460> made<00:01:50.610> last<00:01:50.909> night<00:01:51.320> that's<00:01:52.320> how<00:01:52.500> it's

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:52.680

going to look the barrels going to be on
the<00:01:55.500> global<00:01:55.770> platform<00:01:56.360> so<00:01:57.360> it's<00:01:57.509> closer<00:01:57.750> to

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:57.960 
the global platform so it's closer to

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:01.550 
the global platform so it's closer to
the<00:01:58.079> tub<00:01:58.290> and<00:01:58.590> I<00:01:58.649> got<00:01:58.829> to<00:01:58.979> I<00:01:59.960> got<00:02:00.960> like<00:02:01.259> peeing

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:07.080 
out the bottom of this tub
indent<00:02:05.770> I<00:02:05.980> guess<00:02:06.190> and<00:02:06.430> drill<00:02:06.550> some<00:02:06.580> holes<00:02:06.760> and

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:07.090 
indent I guess and drill some holes and

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:09.510 
indent I guess and drill some holes and
make<00:02:07.390> a<00:02:07.450> drain<00:02:07.780> because<00:02:08.200> a<00:02:08.350> thick<00:02:09.070> grain<00:02:09.340> over

00:02:09.510 --> 00:02:09.520

problem<00:03:03.210> with<00:03:03.420> the<00:03:03.540> heaters<00:03:03.870> and<00:03:04.170> then<00:03:04.440> I

00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:04.470 
problem with the heaters and then I

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:07.310 
problem with the heaters and then I
replaced<00:03:04.830> them<00:03:04.980> with<00:03:05.010> the<00:03:05.810> more<00:03:06.810> powerful

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:07.320 
replaced them with the more powerful

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:08.870 
replaced them with the more powerful
ones<00:03:07.530> so<00:03:07.920> they're<00:03:08.100> not<00:03:08.220> working<00:03:08.400> right<00:03:08.700> now

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:08.880
