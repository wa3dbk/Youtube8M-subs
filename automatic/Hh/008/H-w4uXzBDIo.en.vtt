00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:15.030 
hey this is Robert with Sigma three

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:16.700 
hey this is Robert with Sigma three
survival<00:00:15.629> and<00:00:15.780> we're<00:00:15.929> here<00:00:16.080> to<00:00:16.289> show<00:00:16.470> you<00:00:16.500> a

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:16.710 
survival and we're here to show you a

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:19.339 
survival and we're here to show you a
cool<00:00:17.279> little<00:00:17.340> fishing<00:00:17.910> trap<00:00:18.570> it's<00:00:18.869> called<00:00:19.110> a

00:00:19.339 --> 00:00:19.349 
cool little fishing trap it's called a

00:00:19.349 --> 00:00:21.859 
cool little fishing trap it's called a
deadfall<00:00:19.920> fish<00:00:20.369> trap<00:00:20.700> a<00:00:21.029> lot<00:00:21.270> of<00:00:21.419> people<00:00:21.689> like

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:21.869 
deadfall fish trap a lot of people like

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:24.800 
deadfall fish trap a lot of people like
to<00:00:21.900> use<00:00:22.050> a<00:00:22.200> spring<00:00:22.770> snare<00:00:23.099> fish<00:00:23.820> trap<00:00:24.180> which<00:00:24.779> is

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:24.810 
to use a spring snare fish trap which is

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:26.779 
to use a spring snare fish trap which is
similar<00:00:25.590> to<00:00:25.680> this<00:00:25.829> it's<00:00:26.099> based<00:00:26.310> on<00:00:26.490> the<00:00:26.610> same

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:26.789 
similar to this it's based on the same

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:28.040 
similar to this it's based on the same
principle<00:00:27.360> but<00:00:27.390> it's<00:00:27.689> done<00:00:27.869> with<00:00:28.020> a

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:28.050 
principle but it's done with a

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:31.009 
principle but it's done with a
counterweight<00:00:28.550> instead<00:00:29.550> of<00:00:29.699> actual<00:00:30.630> actually

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:31.019 
counterweight instead of actual actually

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:33.890 
counterweight instead of actual actually
tying<00:00:31.259> down<00:00:31.589> a<00:00:31.790> tree<00:00:32.790> limb<00:00:33.000> I<00:00:33.300> like<00:00:33.750> this

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:33.900 
tying down a tree limb I like this

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:35.720 
tying down a tree limb I like this
method<00:00:34.110> a<00:00:34.350> lot<00:00:34.559> better<00:00:34.860> because<00:00:35.100> when<00:00:35.519> you<00:00:35.610> do

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:35.730 
method a lot better because when you do

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:37.939 
method a lot better because when you do
a<00:00:35.760> spring<00:00:36.150> snare<00:00:36.480> with<00:00:36.720> a<00:00:36.750> tree<00:00:37.050> limb<00:00:37.260> the

00:00:37.939 --> 00:00:37.949 
a spring snare with a tree limb the

00:00:37.949 --> 00:00:39.320 
a spring snare with a tree limb the
problem<00:00:38.280> with<00:00:38.370> that<00:00:38.519> is<00:00:38.670> you<00:00:38.790> almost<00:00:38.910> never

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:39.330 
problem with that is you almost never

00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:41.119 
problem with that is you almost never
find<00:00:39.570> them<00:00:39.780> anywhere<00:00:40.080> that<00:00:40.320> you<00:00:40.470> need<00:00:40.680> them<00:00:40.830> or

00:00:41.119 --> 00:00:41.129 
find them anywhere that you need them or

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:43.400 
find them anywhere that you need them or
want<00:00:41.400> them<00:00:41.670> you<00:00:42.449> can<00:00:42.600> strap<00:00:42.839> them<00:00:42.900> the<00:00:43.140> trees

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:43.410 
want them you can strap them the trees

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:45.799 
want them you can strap them the trees
but<00:00:43.650> the<00:00:43.769> problem<00:00:44.190> with<00:00:44.610> the<00:00:44.970> spring<00:00:45.269> snare<00:00:45.570> is

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:45.809 
but the problem with the spring snare is

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:47.660 
but the problem with the spring snare is
is<00:00:46.049> that<00:00:46.260> if<00:00:46.530> you<00:00:46.710> find<00:00:46.920> it<00:00:47.100> if<00:00:47.220> it's<00:00:47.400> slightly

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
is that if you find it if it's slightly

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:50.570 
is that if you find it if it's slightly
green<00:00:48.119> then<00:00:49.080> it'll<00:00:49.530> conform<00:00:49.979> to<00:00:50.220> the<00:00:50.309> way<00:00:50.430> that

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:50.580 
green then it'll conform to the way that

00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:53.000 
green then it'll conform to the way that
you<00:00:50.760> bend<00:00:51.030> it<00:00:51.210> and<00:00:51.420> if<00:00:52.080> it's<00:00:52.320> slightly<00:00:52.680> dead

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
you bend it and if it's slightly dead

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:55.460 
you bend it and if it's slightly dead
then<00:00:53.280> you<00:00:53.309> can't<00:00:53.610> get<00:00:53.850> enough<00:00:54.229> enough<00:00:55.229> bend

00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:55.470 
then you can't get enough enough bend

00:00:55.470 --> 00:00:57.590 
then you can't get enough enough bend
out<00:00:55.680> of<00:00:55.799> it<00:00:55.890> to<00:00:56.010> get<00:00:56.100> enough<00:00:56.339> rise<00:00:56.580> action<00:00:57.119> so<00:00:57.360> I

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
out of it to get enough rise action so I

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:59.750 
out of it to get enough rise action so I
build<00:00:58.170> most<00:00:58.379> of<00:00:58.589> my<00:00:58.680> triggers<00:00:59.100> on<00:00:59.220> dead<00:00:59.460> falls

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
build most of my triggers on dead falls

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:01.219 
build most of my triggers on dead falls
because<00:01:00.119> I<00:01:00.299> think<00:01:00.510> that<00:01:00.629> they're<00:01:00.780> a<00:01:00.809> lot<00:01:00.989> more

00:01:01.219 --> 00:01:01.229 
because I think that they're a lot more

00:01:01.229 --> 00:01:04.369 
because I think that they're a lot more
practical<00:01:01.680> basically<00:01:02.670> what<00:01:02.850> we've<00:01:03.030> done<00:01:03.170> is<00:01:04.170> I

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
practical basically what we've done is I

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:06.980 
practical basically what we've done is I
take<00:01:04.589> us<00:01:04.830> take<00:01:05.129> and<00:01:05.700> it's<00:01:06.150> got<00:01:06.330> just<00:01:06.600> a<00:01:06.689> slight

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
take us take and it's got just a slight

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:08.750 
take us take and it's got just a slight
little<00:01:07.350> tip<00:01:07.530> on<00:01:07.710> it<00:01:07.770> here<00:01:08.189> and<00:01:08.369> I'll<00:01:08.490> show<00:01:08.520> you

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:08.760 
little tip on it here and I'll show you

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:10.969 
little tip on it here and I'll show you
here<00:01:09.060> in<00:01:09.119> a<00:01:09.240> second<00:01:09.750> up<00:01:09.900> close<00:01:10.080> exactly<00:01:10.799> what

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979 
here in a second up close exactly what

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:12.920 
here in a second up close exactly what
it<00:01:11.100> looks<00:01:11.310> like<00:01:11.580> and<00:01:12.180> you<00:01:12.390> have<00:01:12.420> a<00:01:12.570> trigger

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930 
it looks like and you have a trigger

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:14.870 
it looks like and you have a trigger
system<00:01:13.259> which<00:01:13.860> is<00:01:14.009> very<00:01:14.280> simple

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
system which is very simple

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:17.270 
system which is very simple
you<00:01:15.509> basically<00:01:15.720> just<00:01:15.960> tie<00:01:16.290> your<00:01:16.470> trotline<00:01:16.800> off

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
you basically just tie your trotline off

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:18.920 
you basically just tie your trotline off
on<00:01:17.550> one<00:01:17.790> end<00:01:18.030> and<00:01:18.210> then<00:01:18.300> you've<00:01:18.450> got<00:01:18.630> a<00:01:18.660> notch

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
on one end and then you've got a notch

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:21.110 
on one end and then you've got a notch
in<00:01:19.170> the<00:01:19.290> other<00:01:19.470> end<00:01:19.770> and<00:01:19.980> you<00:01:20.040> hook<00:01:20.670> this<00:01:20.850> notch

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:21.120 
in the other end and you hook this notch

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:24.430 
in the other end and you hook this notch
into<00:01:21.630> the<00:01:22.230> post<00:01:22.500> that<00:01:22.650> you've<00:01:22.890> driven<00:01:23.100> down

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:24.440 
into the post that you've driven down

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:29.390 
into the post that you've driven down
and<00:01:26.360> all<00:01:27.360> we<00:01:27.600> do<00:01:27.780> is<00:01:28.080> we're<00:01:29.070> going<00:01:29.190> to<00:01:29.280> hook

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
and all we do is we're going to hook

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:32.660 
and all we do is we're going to hook
this<00:01:29.610> in<00:01:29.970> on<00:01:30.870> a<00:01:30.930> hair-trigger<00:01:31.320> and<00:01:31.950> then<00:01:32.550> we'll

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670 
this in on a hair-trigger and then we'll

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:34.970 
this in on a hair-trigger and then we'll
tie<00:01:32.880> our<00:01:33.060> fishing<00:01:33.480> line<00:01:33.659> and<00:01:33.990> run<00:01:34.290> it<00:01:34.500> out

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:34.980 
tie our fishing line and run it out

00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:36.950 
tie our fishing line and run it out
and<00:01:35.070> however<00:01:35.520> however<00:01:36.150> we<00:01:36.360> want<00:01:36.540> to<00:01:36.600> set<00:01:36.780> it<00:01:36.870> up

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
and however however we want to set it up

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:38.750 
and however however we want to set it up
whether<00:01:37.230> it<00:01:37.320> be<00:01:37.409> on<00:01:37.500> a<00:01:37.530> bobber<00:01:37.830> system<00:01:38.400> or<00:01:38.640> if

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:38.760 
whether it be on a bobber system or if

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:40.310 
whether it be on a bobber system or if
your<00:01:38.909> bottom<00:01:39.270> fish<00:01:39.480> and<00:01:39.720> just<00:01:39.960> depends<00:01:40.260> on

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320 
your bottom fish and just depends on

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:42.080 
your bottom fish and just depends on
what<00:01:40.500> you<00:01:40.620> want<00:01:40.800> to<00:01:40.860> go<00:01:40.979> for<00:01:41.250> but<00:01:41.729> basically

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
what you want to go for but basically

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:44.719 
what you want to go for but basically
what<00:01:42.300> happens<00:01:42.330> is<00:01:42.990> when<00:01:43.170> the<00:01:43.290> fish<00:01:43.500> tugs<00:01:44.310> at<00:01:44.550> it

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:44.729 
what happens is when the fish tugs at it

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:46.760 
what happens is when the fish tugs at it
on<00:01:44.909> this<00:01:45.090> hair<00:01:45.330> trigger<00:01:45.659> it'll<00:01:46.050> pull<00:01:46.380> it<00:01:46.680> a

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770 
on this hair trigger it'll pull it a

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:48.530 
on this hair trigger it'll pull it a
release<00:01:47.070> and<00:01:47.340> it<00:01:47.460> will<00:01:47.550> set<00:01:47.790> the<00:01:47.909> hook<00:01:48.060> for<00:01:48.390> you

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:48.540 
release and it will set the hook for you

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:50.960 
release and it will set the hook for you
and<00:01:49.530> we're<00:01:49.979> gonna<00:01:50.040> finish<00:01:50.370> building<00:01:50.490> the<00:01:50.820> rest

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:50.970 
and we're gonna finish building the rest

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:52.790 
and we're gonna finish building the rest
of<00:01:51.150> the<00:01:51.210> trap<00:01:51.479> and<00:01:51.720> see<00:01:51.870> if<00:01:51.960> we<00:01:52.110> can't<00:01:52.350> get

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:52.800 
of the trap and see if we can't get

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:54.830 
of the trap and see if we can't get
something<00:01:53.040> going<00:01:53.430> alright<00:01:54.420> we've<00:01:54.540> got<00:01:54.720> our

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:54.840 
something going alright we've got our

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:56.570 
something going alright we've got our
trigger<00:01:55.140> and<00:01:55.350> our<00:01:55.440> deadfall<00:01:55.920> and<00:01:56.190> everything

00:01:56.570 --> 00:01:56.580 
trigger and our deadfall and everything

00:01:56.580 --> 00:01:58.969 
trigger and our deadfall and everything
set<00:01:56.820> up<00:01:56.880> and<00:01:57.240> basically<00:01:57.600> what<00:01:57.900> we<00:01:58.049> did<00:01:58.260> instead

00:01:58.969 --> 00:01:58.979 
set up and basically what we did instead

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:01.520 
set up and basically what we did instead
of<00:01:59.130> doing<00:01:59.430> like<00:01:59.580> a<00:01:59.610> bobber<00:01:59.940> set<00:02:00.360> set<00:02:00.960> we're

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:01.530 
of doing like a bobber set set we're

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:04.070 
of doing like a bobber set set we're
going<00:02:01.680> to<00:02:01.740> do<00:02:02.150> we're<00:02:03.150> going<00:02:03.240> to<00:02:03.330> basically<00:02:03.540> run

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:04.080 
going to do we're going to basically run

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:06.230 
going to do we're going to basically run
it<00:02:04.229> along<00:02:04.320> the<00:02:04.500> bottom<00:02:04.799> that's<00:02:05.760> a<00:02:05.880> lot<00:02:06.060> better

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:06.240 
it along the bottom that's a lot better

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:07.490 
it along the bottom that's a lot better
for<00:02:06.570> something<00:02:06.900> that<00:02:07.020> you're<00:02:07.140> going<00:02:07.260> to<00:02:07.320> leave

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:07.500 
for something that you're going to leave

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:09.350 
for something that you're going to leave
for<00:02:07.799> longer<00:02:08.129> periods<00:02:08.489> of<00:02:08.580> time<00:02:08.789> because<00:02:09.060> if

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:09.360 
for longer periods of time because if

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:11.270 
for longer periods of time because if
you've<00:02:09.509> got<00:02:09.539> a<00:02:09.720> bobber<00:02:10.099> primitive<00:02:11.099> type

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:11.280 
you've got a bobber primitive type

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:13.009 
you've got a bobber primitive type
bobber<00:02:11.549> setup<00:02:12.120> and<00:02:12.360> we'll<00:02:12.450> show<00:02:12.629> that<00:02:12.870> in<00:02:12.959> a

00:02:13.009 --> 00:02:13.019 
bobber setup and we'll show that in a

00:02:13.019 --> 00:02:16.160 
bobber setup and we'll show that in a
different<00:02:13.349> video<00:02:14.599> basically<00:02:15.599> what<00:02:15.810> happens

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:16.170 
different video basically what happens

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:17.839 
different video basically what happens
is<00:02:16.260> it'll<00:02:16.500> blow<00:02:16.709> in<00:02:16.920> the<00:02:17.010> wind<00:02:17.040> and<00:02:17.610> it'll<00:02:17.760> get

00:02:17.839 --> 00:02:17.849 
is it'll blow in the wind and it'll get

00:02:17.849 --> 00:02:20.330 
is it'll blow in the wind and it'll get
caught<00:02:18.090> up<00:02:18.330> and<00:02:18.540> tangled<00:02:18.930> up<00:02:19.080> and<00:02:19.340> vegetation

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:20.340 
caught up and tangled up and vegetation

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:22.099 
caught up and tangled up and vegetation
and<00:02:20.489> things<00:02:20.700> like<00:02:20.969> that<00:02:21.209> so<00:02:21.420> it<00:02:21.540> needs<00:02:21.719> to<00:02:21.870> a

00:02:22.099 --> 00:02:22.109 
and things like that so it needs to a

00:02:22.109 --> 00:02:24.100 
and things like that so it needs to a
bobber<00:02:22.499> set<00:02:22.799> something<00:02:23.159> you<00:02:23.219> need

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:24.110 
bobber set something you need

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:26.410 
bobber set something you need
you<00:02:24.380> know<00:02:24.500> be<00:02:24.860> around<00:02:25.190> and<00:02:25.520> be<00:02:25.610> close<00:02:25.850> to<00:02:26.120> but

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:26.420 
you know be around and be close to but

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:28.840 
you know be around and be close to but
basically<00:02:27.080> all<00:02:27.200> we've<00:02:27.380> done<00:02:27.560> is<00:02:27.800> just<00:02:27.850> gotten

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:28.850 
basically all we've done is just gotten

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:30.670 
basically all we've done is just gotten
a<00:02:28.910> sinker<00:02:29.300> here<00:02:29.510> you<00:02:29.630> just<00:02:29.810> grab<00:02:30.020> a<00:02:30.050> rock<00:02:30.410> tie

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:30.680 
a sinker here you just grab a rock tie

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:32.620 
a sinker here you just grab a rock tie
your<00:02:30.860> trotline<00:02:31.160> to<00:02:31.670> it<00:02:31.850> and<00:02:32.000> then<00:02:32.360> you<00:02:32.450> tie

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:32.630 
your trotline to it and then you tie

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:34.930 
your trotline to it and then you tie
your<00:02:32.810> monofilament<00:02:33.290> to<00:02:33.830> where<00:02:34.040> your<00:02:34.490> sinker

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:34.940 
your monofilament to where your sinker

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:40.740 
your monofilament to where your sinker
setup<00:02:35.360> is<00:02:35.690> and<00:02:36.880> my<00:02:37.880> sinker<00:02:38.390> is<00:02:39.260> attached<00:02:39.740> to

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:40.750 
setup is and my sinker is attached to

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:45.690 
setup is and my sinker is attached to
the<00:02:41.750> base<00:02:41.930> of<00:02:42.290> the<00:02:42.650> trigger<00:02:42.920> and<00:02:43.280> what<00:02:44.180> happens

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:45.700 
the base of the trigger and what happens

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:48.210 
the base of the trigger and what happens
the<00:02:46.700> its<00:02:46.820> ownit<00:02:47.000> it's<00:02:47.240> on<00:02:47.420> a<00:02:47.450> hair-trigger

00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:48.220 
the its ownit it's on a hair-trigger

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:52.180 
the its ownit it's on a hair-trigger
what<00:02:49.220> happens<00:02:50.440> and<00:02:51.440> you<00:02:51.560> want<00:02:51.770> to<00:02:51.830> make<00:02:51.980> sure

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:52.190 
what happens and you want to make sure

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:56.890 
what happens and you want to make sure
that<00:02:52.400> your<00:02:52.550> trigger<00:02:54.100> right<00:02:55.100> here<00:02:55.520> is<00:02:55.900> attached

00:02:56.890 --> 00:02:56.900 
that your trigger right here is attached

00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:59.170 
that your trigger right here is attached
at<00:02:57.200> the<00:02:57.230> bottom<00:02:57.470> so<00:02:58.430> that<00:02:58.459> it's<00:02:58.730> even<00:02:59.030> more

00:02:59.170 --> 00:02:59.180 
at the bottom so that it's even more

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:02.890 
at the bottom so that it's even more
sensitive<00:02:59.690> so<00:03:00.470> when<00:03:01.430> we<00:03:01.580> set<00:03:01.850> this<00:03:02.120> and<00:03:02.420> you

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:02.900 
sensitive so when we set this and you

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:04.780 
sensitive so when we set this and you
another<00:03:03.410> thing<00:03:03.650> that's<00:03:03.800> really<00:03:03.920> important<00:03:04.670> is

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:04.790 
another thing that's really important is

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:07.270 
another thing that's really important is
that<00:03:05.090> you<00:03:05.450> want<00:03:05.720> the<00:03:06.170> trigger<00:03:06.500> to<00:03:06.830> be<00:03:06.860> turned

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:07.280 
that you want the trigger to be turned

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:11.010 
that you want the trigger to be turned
in<00:03:07.489> the<00:03:07.610> direction<00:03:07.970> of<00:03:08.360> where<00:03:09.140> the<00:03:09.410> actual

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:11.020 
in the direction of where the actual

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:13.930 
in the direction of where the actual
deadfall<00:03:12.020> is<00:03:12.260> facing<00:03:12.800> it's<00:03:13.489> kind<00:03:13.730> of<00:03:13.790> an

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:13.940 
deadfall is facing it's kind of an

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:25.090 
deadfall is facing it's kind of an
important<00:03:14.450> aspect<00:03:23.680> we're<00:03:24.680> going<00:03:24.800> to<00:03:24.860> go<00:03:24.980> ahead

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:25.100 
important aspect we're going to go ahead

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:37.900 
important aspect we're going to go ahead
and<00:03:25.400> throw<00:03:25.580> it<00:03:25.730> out

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:37.910 

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:40.120 

and<00:03:38.150> you<00:03:38.600> can<00:03:38.780> adjust<00:03:38.870> the<00:03:39.320> sensitivity<00:03:39.530> of

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:40.130 
and you can adjust the sensitivity of

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:42.850 
and you can adjust the sensitivity of
the<00:03:40.280> trigger<00:03:40.550> as<00:03:40.850> needed<00:03:41.530> normally<00:03:42.530> for<00:03:42.560> when

00:03:42.850 --> 00:03:42.860 
the trigger as needed normally for when

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:46.540 
the trigger as needed normally for when
I'm<00:03:42.980> throwing<00:03:43.250> it<00:03:43.520> out<00:03:43.670> I'll<00:03:44.540> go<00:03:44.780> ahead<00:03:45.550> and

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:46.550 
I'm throwing it out I'll go ahead and

00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:50.140 
I'm throwing it out I'll go ahead and
either<00:03:46.760> hold<00:03:47.090> on<00:03:47.330> to<00:03:47.660> it<00:03:47.870> or<00:03:48.200> pour<00:03:48.530> set<00:03:48.830> it<00:03:49.150> to

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:50.150 
either hold on to it or pour set it to

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:59.470 
either hold on to it or pour set it to
be<00:03:55.930> I'm<00:03:56.930> just<00:03:56.960> going<00:03:57.230> to<00:03:57.290> take<00:03:57.470> my<00:03:57.680> rock<00:03:57.950> in<00:03:58.480> one

00:03:59.470 --> 00:03:59.480 
be I'm just going to take my rock in one

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:02.080 
be I'm just going to take my rock in one
hand<00:03:59.810> and<00:04:00.200> my<00:04:00.440> hook<00:04:00.650> in<00:04:00.860> the<00:04:00.950> other<00:04:01.160> and<00:04:01.910> let

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:02.090 
hand and my hook in the other and let

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:15.630 
hand and my hook in the other and let
the<00:04:02.240> weight<00:04:02.390> of<00:04:02.420> the<00:04:02.600> rock<00:04:02.810> take<00:04:03.320> the<00:04:03.500> bait

00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:15.640 

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:18.610 

I'll<00:04:16.640> keep<00:04:16.850> it<00:04:17.030> real<00:04:17.270> sensitive<00:04:17.900> like<00:04:18.140> I<00:04:18.320> said

00:04:18.610 --> 00:04:18.620 
I'll keep it real sensitive like I said

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:23.620 
I'll keep it real sensitive like I said
and<00:04:19.570> when<00:04:20.570> he<00:04:20.690> pulls<00:04:20.989> on<00:04:21.230> it<00:04:22.210> I'm<00:04:23.210> gonna<00:04:23.330> pull

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:23.630 
and when he pulls on it I'm gonna pull

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:29.260 
and when he pulls on it I'm gonna pull
and<00:04:23.930> set<00:04:24.470> the<00:04:24.620> hook<00:04:24.800> and<00:04:27.640> that's<00:04:28.640> basically<00:04:29.060> it

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:29.270 
and set the hook and that's basically it
