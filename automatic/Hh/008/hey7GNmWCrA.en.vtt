00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:07.500
 it starts with color reduction 

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.490
 I select the prevailing colors 

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:18.250
 that I display in the color list 

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
 I apply color reduction 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:27.500
 I get the drawing in separate colors 

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
 start the variant 

00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:34.420
 choosing colors from Pantone Tessile 

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.780
 I see the variant in real time 

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:57.640
 I generate all my variations 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:17.080
 I move easily in the colored colors 

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:52.500
 finished the variants 

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:58.730
 I select a design motif 

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:25.160
 and I create a new all-over 

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:37.500
 copy-paste parts of the new all-over 

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:43.170
 which are repeated in the report 

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:02.500
 Amount the design of a model 

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:07.500
 I insert the drawing in proportion 

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:34.370
 I add the fabric in real size 

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:44.580
 I make some copies 

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:58.330
 I'm going to change live 

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:25.690
 I make a line with a single command 

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:42.880
 I add a star 

00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:04.440
 I create a new all-over 

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:13.160
 that I apply to my figures 

00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:37.500
 variant the new design 

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:46.290
 which I distribute on sketches 

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:56.400
 in less than 5 minutes 

00:06:00.500 --> 00:06:02.980
 ColorWay allows me 

00:06:05.500 --> 00:06:07.500
 to carry out all these steps 

00:06:07.930 --> 00:06:13.930
 using the Pantone Tessili 

00:06:14.430 --> 00:06:16.430
 without any additional software
