00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:45.850

so the first thing we need to do is to

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:53.219 
so the first thing we need to do is to
find<00:01:51.850> out<00:01:52.030> what<00:01:52.270> the<00:01:52.450> light<00:01:52.659> levels<00:01:53.049> are

00:01:53.219 --> 00:01:53.229 
find out what the light levels are

00:01:53.229 --> 00:01:56.490 
find out what the light levels are
outside<00:01:54.450> due<00:01:55.450> to<00:01:55.600> the<00:01:55.720> low<00:01:55.900> level<00:01:56.200> of<00:01:56.290> light

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:56.500 
outside due to the low level of light

00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:59.520 
outside due to the low level of light
outside<00:01:57.040> I'm<00:01:57.280> going<00:01:57.460> to<00:01:57.580> use<00:01:57.760> 200<00:01:58.390> ISO<00:01:58.810> and<00:01:59.140> a

00:01:59.520 --> 00:01:59.530 
outside I'm going to use 200 ISO and a

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:01.320 
outside I'm going to use 200 ISO and a
shutter<00:01:59.770> speed<00:01:59.979> of<00:02:00.130> a<00:02:00.280> sixtieth<00:02:00.760> of<00:02:00.850> a<00:02:00.939> second

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:01.330 
shutter speed of a sixtieth of a second

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:04.170 
shutter speed of a sixtieth of a second
so<00:02:02.229> on<00:02:02.409> my<00:02:02.590> meter<00:02:02.830> I've<00:02:03.070> set<00:02:03.340> these<00:02:03.490> values<00:02:03.970> I

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:04.180 
so on my meter I've set these values I

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:05.880 
so on my meter I've set these values I
just<00:02:04.780> take<00:02:04.960> a<00:02:04.990> meter<00:02:05.290> really<00:02:05.560> through<00:02:05.770> the

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:05.890 
just take a meter really through the

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:08.550 
just take a meter really through the
window<00:02:06.210> and<00:02:07.210> that<00:02:07.630> tells<00:02:07.930> me<00:02:08.110> the<00:02:08.200> aperture

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:08.560 
window and that tells me the aperture

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:13.110 
window and that tells me the aperture
needs<00:02:08.739> to<00:02:08.860> be<00:02:08.950> at<00:02:09.069> 5.6<00:02:11.220> so<00:02:12.220> on<00:02:12.400> my<00:02:12.550> camera<00:02:12.819> I've

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:13.120 
needs to be at 5.6 so on my camera I've

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:14.780 
needs to be at 5.6 so on my camera I've
set<00:02:13.390> the<00:02:13.510> ISO<00:02:13.840> to<00:02:14.230> 2

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:14.790 
set the ISO to 2

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:17.509 
set the ISO to 2
the<00:02:15.569> shutter<00:02:15.810> speed<00:02:16.140> to<00:02:16.170> a<00:02:16.319> sixtieth<00:02:16.860> and<00:02:17.099> the

00:02:17.509 --> 00:02:17.519 
the shutter speed to a sixtieth and the

00:02:17.519 --> 00:02:22.160 
the shutter speed to a sixtieth and the
aperture<00:02:17.760> to<00:02:18.180> 5.6<00:02:18.930> now<00:02:19.920> if<00:02:20.129> I<00:02:20.250> take<00:02:20.430> a<00:02:20.459> shot<00:02:21.170> you

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:22.170 
aperture to 5.6 now if I take a shot you

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:23.899 
aperture to 5.6 now if I take a shot you
can<00:02:22.349> see<00:02:22.530> that<00:02:22.739> the<00:02:22.860> outside<00:02:23.010> is<00:02:23.489> correctly

00:02:23.899 --> 00:02:23.909 
can see that the outside is correctly

00:02:23.909 --> 00:02:27.670 
can see that the outside is correctly
exposed<00:02:24.299> but<00:02:24.900> our<00:02:25.019> subject<00:02:25.500> is<00:02:25.709> a<00:02:25.769> silhouette

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:27.680 
exposed but our subject is a silhouette

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:30.289 
exposed but our subject is a silhouette
for<00:02:28.680> this<00:02:28.829> example<00:02:29.220> I'm<00:02:29.549> using<00:02:29.760> just<00:02:29.939> one

00:02:30.289 --> 00:02:30.299 
for this example I'm using just one

00:02:30.299 --> 00:02:32.750 
for this example I'm using just one
light<00:02:30.599> if<00:02:31.079> I<00:02:31.379> wanted<00:02:31.650> to<00:02:31.709> light<00:02:31.980> a<00:02:32.010> larger<00:02:32.489> area

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:32.760 
light if I wanted to light a larger area

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:34.940 
light if I wanted to light a larger area
I<00:02:33.060> would<00:02:33.209> normally<00:02:33.540> use<00:02:33.569> two<00:02:34.019> but<00:02:34.799> the

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:34.950 
I would normally use two but the

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:37.460 
I would normally use two but the
techniques<00:02:35.340> the<00:02:35.519> same<00:02:35.840> so<00:02:36.840> I've<00:02:36.900> set<00:02:37.110> my<00:02:37.260> light

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:37.470 
techniques the same so I've set my light

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:39.350 
techniques the same so I've set my light
up<00:02:37.709> and<00:02:38.159> with<00:02:38.340> the<00:02:38.430> modding<00:02:38.730> lamp<00:02:38.909> I<00:02:39.060> can<00:02:39.239> be

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:39.360 
up and with the modding lamp I can be

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:40.940 
up and with the modding lamp I can be
sure<00:02:39.599> that<00:02:39.629> the<00:02:40.019> flash<00:02:40.230> is<00:02:40.409> not<00:02:40.590> going<00:02:40.799> to<00:02:40.859> be

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:40.950 
sure that the flash is not going to be

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:44.179 
sure that the flash is not going to be
reflected<00:02:41.519> into<00:02:41.970> the<00:02:42.180> glass<00:02:42.769> we<00:02:43.769> know<00:02:43.980> that

00:02:44.179 --> 00:02:44.189 
reflected into the glass we know that

00:02:44.189 --> 00:02:46.670 
reflected into the glass we know that
five<00:02:44.400> point<00:02:44.609> six<00:02:44.909> is<00:02:45.120> correct<00:02:45.450> for<00:02:45.569> outside<00:02:45.989> so

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:46.680 
five point six is correct for outside so

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:48.410 
five point six is correct for outside so
we<00:02:46.829> now<00:02:47.010> need<00:02:47.220> to<00:02:47.250> set<00:02:47.519> the<00:02:47.640> power<00:02:47.819> of<00:02:47.970> my<00:02:48.090> flash

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:48.420 
we now need to set the power of my flash

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:51.710 
we now need to set the power of my flash
to<00:02:48.450> match<00:02:48.870> it<00:02:49.970> by<00:02:50.970> pressing<00:02:51.359> the<00:02:51.480> mode<00:02:51.659> button

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:51.720 
to match it by pressing the mode button

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:54.110 
to match it by pressing the mode button
on<00:02:52.109> the<00:02:52.230> meter<00:02:52.440> I<00:02:52.769> can<00:02:53.280> now<00:02:53.459> set<00:02:53.700> it<00:02:53.849> to<00:02:54.000> the

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:54.120 
on the meter I can now set it to the

00:02:54.120 --> 00:03:01.670 
on the meter I can now set it to the
flash<00:02:54.359> mode<00:02:54.599> now<00:02:55.409> let's<00:02:55.739> take<00:02:55.950> a<00:02:55.980> reading<00:03:00.680> okay

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:01.680 
flash mode now let's take a reading okay

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:03.589 
flash mode now let's take a reading okay
so<00:03:01.739> that<00:03:02.099> says<00:03:02.340> five<00:03:02.609> point<00:03:02.879> six<00:03:03.060> point<00:03:03.299> five

00:03:03.589 --> 00:03:03.599 
so that says five point six point five

00:03:03.599 --> 00:03:06.259 
so that says five point six point five
so<00:03:04.379> to<00:03:04.440> get<00:03:04.680> that<00:03:04.859> to<00:03:04.920> five<00:03:05.310> point<00:03:05.579> six<00:03:05.819> I<00:03:06.090> need

00:03:06.259 --> 00:03:06.269 
so to get that to five point six I need

00:03:06.269 --> 00:03:08.449 
so to get that to five point six I need
to<00:03:06.359> change<00:03:06.629> the<00:03:06.810> power<00:03:07.019> down<00:03:07.379> by<00:03:07.829> five<00:03:08.159> tenths

00:03:08.449 --> 00:03:08.459 
to change the power down by five tenths

00:03:08.459 --> 00:03:10.729 
to change the power down by five tenths
of<00:03:08.609> a<00:03:08.700> stop<00:03:08.940> as<00:03:09.180> I'm<00:03:09.870> using<00:03:10.079> the<00:03:10.319> range<00:03:10.530> of

00:03:10.729 --> 00:03:10.739

00:03:23.699 --> 00:03:26.599 
times I can now take another shot
triggering<00:03:24.209> my<00:03:24.359> flash<00:03:24.660> and<00:03:24.959> hey<00:03:25.620> presto<00:03:26.099> we've

00:03:26.599 --> 00:03:26.609 
triggering my flash and hey presto we've

00:03:26.609 --> 00:03:29.089 
triggering my flash and hey presto we've
balanced<00:03:27.090> the<00:03:27.120> lighting<00:03:27.569> this<00:03:28.379> shots<00:03:28.650> okay

00:03:29.089 --> 00:03:29.099 
balanced the lighting this shots okay

00:03:29.099 --> 00:03:30.439 
balanced the lighting this shots okay
but<00:03:29.489> I<00:03:29.519> think<00:03:29.760> there's<00:03:29.940> something<00:03:30.120> not<00:03:30.389> quite

00:03:30.439 --> 00:03:30.449 
but I think there's something not quite

00:03:30.449 --> 00:03:34.189 
but I think there's something not quite
right<00:03:30.750> about<00:03:30.989> it<00:03:32.180> now<00:03:33.180> in<00:03:33.419> a<00:03:33.480> moment<00:03:33.660> I'm<00:03:33.989> going

00:03:34.189 --> 00:03:34.199 
right about it now in a moment I'm going

00:03:34.199 --> 00:03:35.539 
right about it now in a moment I'm going
to<00:03:34.260> put<00:03:34.410> the<00:03:34.500> picture<00:03:34.650> back<00:03:35.040> on<00:03:35.250> the<00:03:35.370> screen

00:03:35.539 --> 00:03:35.549 
to put the picture back on the screen

00:03:35.549 --> 00:03:38.449 
to put the picture back on the screen
and<00:03:35.940> ask<00:03:36.449> you<00:03:36.629> to<00:03:36.690> press<00:03:37.019> the<00:03:37.199> pause<00:03:37.410> button<00:03:37.799> to

00:03:38.449 --> 00:03:38.459 
and ask you to press the pause button to

00:03:38.459 --> 00:03:40.039 
and ask you to press the pause button to
give<00:03:38.609> you<00:03:38.760> time<00:03:39.030> to<00:03:39.209> have<00:03:39.329> a<00:03:39.359> think<00:03:39.629> about<00:03:39.870> this

00:03:40.039 --> 00:03:40.049 
give you time to have a think about this

00:03:40.049 --> 00:03:42.800 
give you time to have a think about this
so<00:03:40.980> find<00:03:41.310> your<00:03:41.459> remote<00:03:41.790> and<00:03:42.060> get<00:03:42.540> ready<00:03:42.690> to

so find your remote and get ready to

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:46.640 
so find your remote and get ready to
press<00:03:44.299> the<00:03:45.299> reason<00:03:45.660> I<00:03:45.840> think<00:03:45.900> it<00:03:46.349> looks<00:03:46.530> a

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:46.650 
press the reason I think it looks a

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:48.710 
press the reason I think it looks a
little<00:03:46.739> odd<00:03:47.069> is<00:03:47.549> that<00:03:47.849> my<00:03:48.000> brain<00:03:48.329> is<00:03:48.540> telling

00:03:48.710 --> 00:03:48.720 
little odd is that my brain is telling

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:50.479 
little odd is that my brain is telling
me<00:03:48.959> that<00:03:48.989> the<00:03:49.260> light<00:03:49.410> outside<00:03:49.739> should<00:03:50.370> be

00:03:50.479 --> 00:03:50.489 
me that the light outside should be

00:03:50.489 --> 00:03:53.030 
me that the light outside should be
brighter<00:03:50.790> than<00:03:50.970> the<00:03:51.269> light<00:03:51.389> inside<00:03:51.900> at<00:03:52.829> the

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:53.040 
brighter than the light inside at the

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:55.520 
brighter than the light inside at the
moment<00:03:53.430> it's<00:03:53.579> balanced<00:03:54.120> we<00:03:54.840> need<00:03:55.019> to<00:03:55.139> find<00:03:55.379> a

00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:55.530 
moment it's balanced we need to find a

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:57.830 
moment it's balanced we need to find a
way<00:03:55.709> to<00:03:55.769> bring<00:03:56.220> the<00:03:56.370> exposure<00:03:56.790> outside<00:03:57.150> up

00:03:57.830 --> 00:03:57.840 
way to bring the exposure outside up

00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:00.890 
way to bring the exposure outside up
without<00:03:58.590> altering<00:03:59.190> the<00:03:59.340> inside<00:03:59.730> exposure<00:04:00.239> any

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:00.900 
without altering the inside exposure any

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:05.720 
without altering the inside exposure any
ideas<00:04:03.590> okay<00:04:04.590> so<00:04:04.650> here's<00:04:05.069> the<00:04:05.220> picture<00:04:05.340> again

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:05.730 
ideas okay so here's the picture again

00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:07.869 
ideas okay so here's the picture again
are<00:04:06.000> you<00:04:06.810> ready<00:04:07.049> with<00:04:07.260> that<00:04:07.379> pause<00:04:07.620> button

00:04:07.869 --> 00:04:07.879 
are you ready with that pause button

00:04:07.879 --> 00:04:10.250 
are you ready with that pause button
just<00:04:08.879> have<00:04:09.090> a<00:04:09.120> think<00:04:09.419> about<00:04:09.629> how<00:04:09.690> we<00:04:09.870> can<00:04:10.109> do<00:04:10.230> it

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:10.260 
just have a think about how we can do it

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:18.120 
just have a think about how we can do it
so<00:04:11.190> press<00:04:11.489> pause<00:04:11.519> now

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:18.130 

00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:20.319 

well<00:04:19.130> how<00:04:19.519> did<00:04:19.669> you<00:04:19.699> get<00:04:19.910> on

00:04:20.319 --> 00:04:20.329 
well how did you get on

00:04:20.329 --> 00:04:23.050 
well how did you get on
if<00:04:20.540> you<00:04:21.169> said<00:04:21.410> change<00:04:21.680> the<00:04:21.889> aperture<00:04:22.130> sorry

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:23.060 
if you said change the aperture sorry

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:24.909 
if you said change the aperture sorry
that<00:04:23.660> would<00:04:23.810> also<00:04:23.960> change<00:04:24.350> the<00:04:24.590> exposure

00:04:24.909 --> 00:04:24.919 
that would also change the exposure

00:04:24.919 --> 00:04:27.520 
that would also change the exposure
inside<00:04:25.520> as<00:04:26.330> we're<00:04:26.630> changing<00:04:26.660> the<00:04:27.199> power<00:04:27.410> of

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:27.530 
inside as we're changing the power of

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:30.610 
inside as we're changing the power of
the<00:04:27.650> light<00:04:27.830> or<00:04:28.250> the<00:04:28.310> i/o<00:04:28.880> so<00:04:29.210> if<00:04:30.110> you<00:04:30.380> said

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:30.620 
the light or the i/o so if you said

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:33.040 
the light or the i/o so if you said
change<00:04:30.919> the<00:04:31.100> shutter<00:04:31.370> speed<00:04:31.580> give<00:04:32.570> yourself<00:04:32.960> a

00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:33.050 
change the shutter speed give yourself a

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:36.700 
change the shutter speed give yourself a
large<00:04:33.320> pat<00:04:33.740> on<00:04:33.889> the<00:04:33.919> back<00:04:35.110> the<00:04:36.110> flashes<00:04:36.530> inc

00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:36.710 
large pat on the back the flashes inc

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:38.920 
large pat on the back the flashes inc
shutter<00:04:37.010> speed<00:04:37.370> is<00:04:37.639> the<00:04:37.790> maximum<00:04:38.419> you<00:04:38.570> can<00:04:38.750> use

00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:38.930 
shutter speed is the maximum you can use

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:41.560 
shutter speed is the maximum you can use
with<00:04:39.139> Studio<00:04:39.470> flash<00:04:39.800> if<00:04:40.460> we<00:04:40.880> use<00:04:41.060> a<00:04:41.090> slower

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:41.570 
with Studio flash if we use a slower

00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:43.870 
with Studio flash if we use a slower
speed<00:04:41.720> it<00:04:42.440> affects<00:04:42.800> the<00:04:42.979> daylight<00:04:43.370> but<00:04:43.669> not

00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:43.880 
speed it affects the daylight but not

00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:46.420 
speed it affects the daylight but not
the<00:04:44.030> flash<00:04:44.240> exposure<00:04:44.590> again<00:04:45.590> watching<00:04:46.280> my

00:04:46.420 --> 00:04:46.430 
the flash exposure again watching my

00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:48.760 
the flash exposure again watching my
flash<00:04:46.699> durations<00:04:47.300> video<00:04:47.600> will<00:04:48.139> explain<00:04:48.500> this

00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:48.770 
flash durations video will explain this

00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:51.129 
flash durations video will explain this
so<00:04:49.669> if<00:04:49.760> I<00:04:49.880> reduce<00:04:50.300> the<00:04:50.510> shutter<00:04:50.750> speed<00:04:51.110> the

00:04:51.129 --> 00:04:51.139 
so if I reduce the shutter speed the

00:04:51.139 --> 00:04:53.500 
so if I reduce the shutter speed the
equivalent<00:04:51.830> of<00:04:51.950> one<00:04:52.190> f-stop<00:04:52.639> which<00:04:53.120> is<00:04:53.300> down

00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:53.510 
equivalent of one f-stop which is down

00:04:53.510 --> 00:04:55.629 
equivalent of one f-stop which is down
to<00:04:53.660> a<00:04:53.720> thirtieth<00:04:54.169> of<00:04:54.260> a<00:04:54.350> second<00:04:54.770> only<00:04:55.400> the

00:04:57.070 --> 00:04:57.080 
ambient light will be one stop

00:04:57.080 --> 00:04:59.469 
ambient light will be one stop
overexposed<00:04:57.800> and<00:04:58.070> we're<00:04:58.880> relying<00:04:59.150> on<00:04:59.360> the

but<00:06:00.380> this<00:06:00.620> venue<00:06:00.890> we<00:06:01.190> have<00:06:01.370> a<00:06:01.400> beautiful<00:06:02.000> view

00:06:02.140 --> 00:06:02.150 
but this venue we have a beautiful view

00:06:02.150 --> 00:06:04.210 
but this venue we have a beautiful view
of<00:06:02.270> the<00:06:02.390> garden<00:06:02.810> but<00:06:03.410> it's<00:06:03.560> actually<00:06:03.980> raining

00:06:04.210 --> 00:06:04.220 
of the garden but it's actually raining

00:06:04.220 --> 00:06:07.780 
of the garden but it's actually raining
so<00:06:04.790> we<00:06:04.820> can't<00:06:05.210> shoot<00:06:05.480> outside<00:06:06.490> things<00:06:07.490> that

00:06:07.780 --> 00:06:07.790 
so we can't shoot outside things that

00:06:07.790 --> 00:06:11.530 
so we can't shoot outside things that
