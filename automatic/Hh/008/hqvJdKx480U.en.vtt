the<00:02:26.100> environment<00:02:26.190> why<00:02:26.550> do<00:02:26.610> you<00:02:26.730> think

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:26.820 
the environment why do you think

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:29.270 
the environment why do you think
electric<00:02:27.330> did<00:02:27.480> not<00:02:27.770> connect<00:02:28.770> with<00:02:29.190> the

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:29.280 
electric did not connect with the

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:31.370 
electric did not connect with the
electric<00:02:29.730> because<00:02:30.270> I<00:02:30.390> would<00:02:30.540> think<00:02:30.720> out<00:02:31.350> of

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:31.380 
electric because I would think out of

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:33.320 
electric because I would think out of
the<00:02:31.530> 20-some<00:02:32.160> thousand<00:02:32.700> people<00:02:32.820> that<00:02:33.090> voted

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:35.960 
the 20-some thousand people that voted
those<00:02:34.020> were<00:02:34.260> the<00:02:34.380> people<00:02:34.410> trying<00:02:34.920> to<00:02:35.040> better

those were the people trying to better
the<00:02:36.240> environment<00:02:36.900> but<00:02:37.080> I<00:02:37.430> think<00:02:38.430> it<00:02:38.580> was<00:02:38.700> just

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:38.850 
the environment but I think it was just

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:40.550 
the environment but I think it was just
way<00:02:39.090> over<00:02:39.120> a<00:02:39.420> lot<00:02:39.600> of<00:02:39.720> people<00:02:39.960> here<00:02:40.110> you<00:02:40.380> know<00:02:40.440> I

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:40.560 
way over a lot of people here you know I

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:43.820 
way over a lot of people here you know I
