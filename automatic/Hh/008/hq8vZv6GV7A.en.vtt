coals off to one side which will keep

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:34.099

the grill nice and warm but not overcook
that<00:00:34.140> meat<00:00:34.920> we're<00:00:35.640> going<00:00:35.760> to<00:00:35.820> season<00:00:36.120> it<00:00:36.390> up

00:00:38.349 --> 00:00:38.359 
that meat we're going to season it up

00:00:38.359 --> 00:00:42.489 
that meat we're going to season it up
with<00:00:39.359> some<00:00:39.569> smoked<00:00:39.929> paprika<00:00:40.550> kosher<00:00:41.550> salt<00:00:42.059> and

00:00:42.489 --> 00:00:42.499 
with some smoked paprika kosher salt and

00:00:42.499 --> 00:00:45.889 
with some smoked paprika kosher salt and
ground<00:00:43.499> black<00:00:43.829> pepper<00:00:43.949> and<00:00:44.579> let<00:00:45.269> it<00:00:45.390> cook<00:00:45.629> for

00:00:45.889 --> 00:00:45.899 
ground black pepper and let it cook for

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:49.369 
ground black pepper and let it cook for
about<00:00:46.319> 45<00:00:47.100> minutes<00:00:47.429> over<00:00:47.839> indirect<00:00:48.839> heat<00:00:49.019> and

00:00:49.369 --> 00:00:49.379 
about 45 minutes over indirect heat and

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:52.160 
about 45 minutes over indirect heat and
then<00:00:49.679> we'll<00:00:49.829> finish<00:00:50.039> it<00:00:50.190> with<00:00:51.149> a<00:00:51.179> reverse<00:00:51.690> sear

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
then we'll finish it with a reverse sear

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:54.139 
then we'll finish it with a reverse sear
which<00:00:52.409> basically<00:00:52.859> means<00:00:53.280> you're<00:00:53.519> searing<00:00:53.999> the

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149 
which basically means you're searing the

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:56.509 
which basically means you're searing the
meat<00:00:54.179> at<00:00:54.569> the<00:00:55.139> end<00:00:55.499> of<00:00:55.710> the<00:00:55.829> cooking<00:00:56.219> process

00:00:56.509 --> 00:00:56.519 
meat at the end of the cooking process

00:00:56.519 --> 00:00:59.750 
meat at the end of the cooking process
so<00:00:56.879> let's<00:00:57.239> cover<00:00:57.510> that<00:00:57.629> up<00:00:58.280> let<00:00:59.280> it<00:00:59.309> cook<00:00:59.609> away

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
so let's cover that up let it cook away

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:02.029 
so let's cover that up let it cook away
and<00:01:00.210> I'll<00:01:00.329> let<00:01:00.539> it<00:01:00.569> go<00:01:00.870> for<00:01:01.170> about<00:01:01.229> 45<00:01:02.010> minutes

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039 
and I'll let it go for about 45 minutes

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:07.900 
and I'll let it go for about 45 minutes
and<00:01:02.760> it'll<00:01:03.479> be<00:01:03.690> perfect<00:01:05.840> all<00:01:06.840> right<00:01:06.900> so<00:01:07.230> our

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:07.910 
and it'll be perfect all right so our

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:11.720 
and it'll be perfect all right so our
rump<00:01:08.910> roast<00:01:09.240> is<00:01:09.600> at<00:01:10.140> about<00:01:10.580> 60<00:01:11.580> degrees

up<00:01:16.740> nicely<00:01:17.100> on<00:01:18.590> the<00:01:19.590> bottom<00:01:20.010> we'll<00:01:20.460> flip<00:01:20.760> it

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:20.910 
up nicely on the bottom we'll flip it

00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:24.170 
up nicely on the bottom we'll flip it
over<00:01:21.800> get<00:01:22.800> a<00:01:22.830> nice<00:01:23.070> crust<00:01:23.490> going<00:01:23.910> on<00:01:24.030> the

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
opposite side and let it go for probably

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:32.140 
opposite side and let it go for probably
another<00:01:28.200> 20<00:01:29.100> 25<00:01:29.310> minutes<00:01:30.090> to<00:01:30.900> get<00:01:31.050> it<00:01:31.170> to<00:01:31.320> about

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:47.420 
it we started it off of the direct flame
and<00:01:44.790> moved<00:01:45.090> it<00:01:45.300> over<00:01:45.630> to<00:01:46.320> the<00:01:46.530> charcoal<00:01:47.100> side

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920 
for the last few minutes just to get

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:54.290 
for the last few minutes just to get
this<00:01:50.310> nice<00:01:50.700> beautiful<00:01:51.660> crust<00:01:52.320> formed<00:01:52.890> on<00:01:53.300> the

rump roast so we'll let that sit for
about<00:01:57.510> 10<00:01:58.320> minutes<00:01:58.560> so<00:01:58.890> the<00:01:59.010> juices<00:01:59.490> reabsorb

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:00.150 
about 10 minutes so the juices reabsorb

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:03.180 
into the meat then we'll slice it up get

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:05.090 
into the meat then we'll slice it up get
it<00:02:03.210> onto<00:02:03.450> a<00:02:03.630> serving<00:02:03.990> platter<00:02:04.380> and<00:02:04.680> get<00:02:04.860> it<00:02:04.980> out

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:05.100
