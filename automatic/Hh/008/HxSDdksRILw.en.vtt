I<00:00:13.200> use<00:00:13.349> LED<00:00:13.980> bulbs<00:00:14.340> and<00:00:14.460> I'll<00:00:14.610> come<00:00:14.820> on<00:00:14.940> to<00:00:15.059> that

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:15.120 
I use LED bulbs and I'll come on to that

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:17.630 
I use LED bulbs and I'll come on to that
in<00:00:15.269> a<00:00:15.420> minute<00:00:15.540> but<00:00:16.470> right<00:00:16.590> now<00:00:16.800> you<00:00:17.310> can<00:00:17.460> see

in a minute but right now you can see

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:20.240 
in a minute but right now you can see
I've<00:00:17.880> got<00:00:18.570> halogen<00:00:19.109> bulbs<00:00:19.410> installed<00:00:19.800> into<00:00:20.160> my

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:20.250 
I've got halogen bulbs installed into my

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:24.050 
I've got halogen bulbs installed into my
thermal<00:00:20.609> edge<00:00:20.760> aquarium<00:00:21.420> right<00:00:21.630> now<00:00:22.070> now<00:00:23.070> one

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:24.060 
thermal edge aquarium right now now one

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:25.759 
thermal edge aquarium right now now one
of<00:00:24.090> the<00:00:24.240> key<00:00:24.449> features<00:00:24.720> of<00:00:25.050> the<00:00:25.230> halogen<00:00:25.470> bulb

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:25.769 
of the key features of the halogen bulb

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:27.769 
of the key features of the halogen bulb
is<00:00:26.039> you'll<00:00:26.430> notice<00:00:26.789> two<00:00:27.060> columns<00:00:27.510> of<00:00:27.599> light

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:27.779 
is you'll notice two columns of light

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:30.560 
is you'll notice two columns of light
coming<00:00:28.019> down<00:00:28.369> because<00:00:29.369> they<00:00:29.490> kind<00:00:30.179> of<00:00:30.330> give

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:30.570 
coming down because they kind of give

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:35.600 
coming down because they kind of give
this<00:00:30.810> or<00:00:31.219> spotlight<00:00:32.219> effect<00:00:32.870> which<00:00:33.950> is<00:00:34.950> okay

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:35.610 
this or spotlight effect which is okay

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:38.479 
this or spotlight effect which is okay
but<00:00:36.059> it<00:00:36.329> doesn't<00:00:36.780> really<00:00:37.129> fill<00:00:38.129> out<00:00:38.280> the

00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:38.489 
but it doesn't really fill out the

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:40.490 
but it doesn't really fill out the
aquarium<00:00:39.180> there's<00:00:39.450> a<00:00:39.540> there's<00:00:39.960> a<00:00:40.020> lot<00:00:40.140> of<00:00:40.230> dark

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:40.500 
aquarium there's a there's a lot of dark

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:43.340 
aquarium there's a there's a lot of dark
corners<00:00:41.239> so<00:00:42.239> that's<00:00:42.420> one<00:00:42.629> of<00:00:42.750> the<00:00:42.809> reasons<00:00:43.170> why

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:43.350 
corners so that's one of the reasons why

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:47.930 
corners so that's one of the reasons why
I<00:00:43.379> swapped<00:00:43.710> onto<00:00:44.390> LED<00:00:45.390> bulbs<00:00:46.370> so<00:00:47.370> I'm<00:00:47.730> gonna

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
I swapped onto LED bulbs so I'm gonna

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:50.389 
I swapped onto LED bulbs so I'm gonna
swap<00:00:48.180> onto<00:00:48.539> the<00:00:48.690> LED<00:00:49.200> bulbs<00:00:49.620> now<00:00:49.800> and<00:00:50.129> show<00:00:50.370> you

00:00:50.389 --> 00:00:50.399 
swap onto the LED bulbs now and show you

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:52.549 
swap onto the LED bulbs now and show you
what<00:00:51.120> a<00:00:51.149> huge<00:00:51.210> difference<00:00:51.539> that<00:00:52.140> it<00:00:52.350> makes

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559 
what a huge difference that it makes

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:58.069 
what a huge difference that it makes
compared<00:00:53.520> to<00:00:53.610> the<00:00:53.699> halogen<00:00:54.059> bulbs<00:00:56.510> boom<00:00:57.510> you

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079 
compared to the halogen bulbs boom you

00:00:58.079 --> 00:00:59.959 
compared to the halogen bulbs boom you
can<00:00:58.230> immediately<00:00:58.649> see<00:00:59.280> the<00:00:59.309> difference<00:00:59.520> that

00:00:59.959 --> 00:00:59.969 
can immediately see the difference that

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:00.680 
can immediately see the difference that
they<00:01:00.180> make

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690 
they make

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:03.310 
they make
now<00:01:01.379> these<00:01:01.500> LED<00:01:02.070> bulbs<00:01:02.460> are<00:01:02.640> a<00:01:02.699> replacement

00:01:03.310 --> 00:01:03.320 
now these LED bulbs are a replacement

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:07.010 
now these LED bulbs are a replacement
for<00:01:04.320> the<00:01:04.860> halogen<00:01:05.400> bulbs<00:01:05.729> they<00:01:06.479> just<00:01:06.720> fit<00:01:06.869> into

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
for the halogen bulbs they just fit into

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:08.359 
for the halogen bulbs they just fit into
the<00:01:07.200> canopy<00:01:07.500> like<00:01:07.830> the<00:01:07.979> others

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:08.369 
the canopy like the others

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:13.760 
the canopy like the others
they<00:01:08.939> are<00:01:09.090> an<00:01:09.240> mr11<00:01:10.200> bulb<00:01:11.100> or<00:01:11.659> mr1<00:01:12.659> one<00:01:12.960> hour

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
they are an mr11 bulb or mr1 one hour

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:16.010 
they are an mr11 bulb or mr1 one hour
later<00:01:14.040> on<00:01:14.250> the<00:01:14.340> video<00:01:14.520> I<00:01:14.939> will<00:01:15.240> show<00:01:15.450> you<00:01:15.479> where

later on the video I will show you where

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:18.380 
later on the video I will show you where
you<00:01:16.140> can<00:01:16.200> get<00:01:16.409> them<00:01:16.590> online<00:01:16.939> really<00:01:17.939> cheap<00:01:18.180> in

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
you can get them online really cheap in

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:22.310 
you can get them online really cheap in
the<00:01:18.600> UK<00:01:19.020> and<00:01:19.259> in<00:01:19.770> the<00:01:19.950> USA<00:01:20.960> one<00:01:21.960> of<00:01:22.080> the<00:01:22.140> key

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:22.320 
the UK and in the USA one of the key

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:24.560 
the UK and in the USA one of the key
things<00:01:22.619> to<00:01:22.740> mention<00:01:23.130> is<00:01:23.310> that<00:01:23.340> halogen<00:01:24.270> bulbs

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 
things to mention is that halogen bulbs

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:27.320 
things to mention is that halogen bulbs
get<00:01:24.840> very<00:01:25.350> very<00:01:25.860> hot<00:01:26.220> there's<00:01:26.700> a<00:01:26.790> lot<00:01:27.000> of<00:01:27.119> waste

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:27.330 
get very very hot there's a lot of waste

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:29.899 
get very very hot there's a lot of waste
energy<00:01:27.869> in<00:01:27.960> them<00:01:28.140> so<00:01:28.680> when<00:01:29.220> it<00:01:29.340> comes<00:01:29.610> to

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:29.909 
energy in them so when it comes to

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:31.789 
energy in them so when it comes to
replacing<00:01:30.360> a<00:01:30.750> bulb<00:01:31.020> or<00:01:31.290> doing<00:01:31.590> some

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:31.799 
replacing a bulb or doing some

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:33.679 
replacing a bulb or doing some
maintenance<00:01:32.009> where<00:01:32.909> you<00:01:33.000> have<00:01:33.119> to<00:01:33.270> touch<00:01:33.479> the

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:33.689 
maintenance where you have to touch the

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:36.710 
maintenance where you have to touch the
bulb<00:01:33.930> area<00:01:34.590> then<00:01:35.430> I<00:01:35.670> recommend<00:01:36.030> that<00:01:36.329> you<00:01:36.390> turn

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720 
bulb area then I recommend that you turn

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:41.240 
bulb area then I recommend that you turn
off<00:01:36.750> the<00:01:37.470> lights<00:01:37.890> for<00:01:39.590> 15-20<00:01:40.590> minutes<00:01:40.890> before

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 
off the lights for 15-20 minutes before

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:43.490 
off the lights for 15-20 minutes before
you<00:01:41.369> actually<00:01:41.400> do<00:01:41.909> any<00:01:42.119> work<00:01:42.360> on<00:01:42.570> them<00:01:42.689> simply

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500 
you actually do any work on them simply

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:44.870 
you actually do any work on them simply
because<00:01:43.829> even<00:01:44.310> if<00:01:44.399> they've<00:01:44.520> been<00:01:44.700> on<00:01:44.820> for

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880 
because even if they've been on for

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:47.300

10-15<00:01:45.540> minutes<00:01:45.930> themselves<00:01:46.590> they<00:01:47.040> become

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:47.310 
10-15 minutes themselves they become

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:50.660 
10-15 minutes themselves they become
very<00:01:47.549> hot<00:01:47.880> and<00:01:48.119> if<00:01:48.479> you<00:01:48.600> touch<00:01:48.810> them<00:01:49.670> you'll

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:50.670 
very hot and if you touch them you'll

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:52.609

LED<00:01:55.860> bulbs<00:01:56.280> do<00:01:56.610> still<00:01:56.969> get<00:01:57.149> warm<00:01:57.420> but<00:01:57.750> nowhere

00:01:58.039 --> 00:01:58.049 
LED bulbs do still get warm but nowhere

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:00.800 
LED bulbs do still get warm but nowhere
near<00:01:58.110> as<00:01:58.770> hot<00:01:58.950> as<00:01:59.040> halogen<00:01:59.430> bulbs<00:01:59.790> they<00:02:00.509> can<00:02:00.689> be

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:00.810 
near as hot as halogen bulbs they can be

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:03.080 
near as hot as halogen bulbs they can be
on<00:02:00.930> for<00:02:01.079> hours<00:02:01.439> on<00:02:01.560> end<00:02:01.619> and<00:02:02.100> still<00:02:02.549> you<00:02:02.909> can

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:04.819 
on for hours on end and still you can
work<00:02:03.299> with<00:02:03.540> them<00:02:03.689> and<00:02:04.140> take<00:02:04.409> them<00:02:04.560> out<00:02:04.649> and

00:02:04.819 --> 00:02:04.829 
work with them and take them out and

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:07.160 
work with them and take them out and
replace<00:02:04.920> them<00:02:05.369> if<00:02:05.460> you<00:02:05.549> need<00:02:05.759> to<00:02:06.049> so<00:02:07.049> that's

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:07.170 
replace them if you need to so that's

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:09.169 
replace them if you need to so that's
another<00:02:07.439> thing<00:02:07.500> to<00:02:07.829> bear<00:02:08.009> in<00:02:08.039> mind<00:02:08.250> another

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:09.179 
another thing to bear in mind another

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:11.180 
another thing to bear in mind another
reason<00:02:09.599> why<00:02:09.690> I<00:02:09.720> swapped<00:02:10.110> LED<00:02:10.619> bulbs<00:02:11.009> is

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:11.190 
reason why I swapped LED bulbs is

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:13.240 
reason why I swapped LED bulbs is
because<00:02:11.730> of<00:02:11.849> the<00:02:11.910> plant<00:02:12.150> growth

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:13.250 
because of the plant growth

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:16.180 
because of the plant growth
the<00:02:13.430> LED<00:02:13.820> bulbs<00:02:14.180> cover<00:02:14.570> a<00:02:14.930> higher<00:02:15.290> area<00:02:15.890> in<00:02:16.070> the

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:16.190 
the LED bulbs cover a higher area in the

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:18.610 
the LED bulbs cover a higher area in the
light<00:02:16.340> spectrum<00:02:16.610> than<00:02:17.390> halogen<00:02:17.870> bulbs<00:02:18.170> and<00:02:18.380> so

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:18.620 
light spectrum than halogen bulbs and so

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:21.630 
light spectrum than halogen bulbs and so
encourages<00:02:19.580> plant<00:02:19.880> growth<00:02:20.180> to<00:02:20.510> flourish

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:21.640 
encourages plant growth to flourish

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:25.570 
encourages plant growth to flourish
so<00:02:22.640> here<00:02:22.820> the<00:02:22.970> two<00:02:23.120> bulbs<00:02:23.390> side<00:02:24.050> by<00:02:24.320> side<00:02:24.680> now

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:25.580 
so here the two bulbs side by side now

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:28.540 
so here the two bulbs side by side now
from<00:02:26.000> the<00:02:26.090> back<00:02:26.270> they<00:02:26.690> look<00:02:26.720> identical<00:02:27.550> this

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:28.550 
from the back they look identical this

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:31.300 
from the back they look identical this
is<00:02:28.700> the<00:02:28.790> characteristic<00:02:29.660> of<00:02:29.840> the<00:02:30.080> mr11<00:02:30.800> bulb

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:31.310 
is the characteristic of the mr11 bulb

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:38.560 
is the characteristic of the mr11 bulb
they<00:02:32.060> have<00:02:32.270> the<00:02:32.870> two<00:02:33.110> pins<00:02:35.620> at<00:02:36.620> the<00:02:36.770> end<00:02:37.570> on

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:38.570 
they have the two pins at the end on

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:42.310 
they have the two pins at the end on
both<00:02:39.170> bulbs<00:02:40.420> however<00:02:41.420> when<00:02:41.870> we<00:02:41.960> turn<00:02:42.140> them

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:42.320 
both bulbs however when we turn them

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:44.970 
both bulbs however when we turn them
over<00:02:42.640> you<00:02:43.640> can<00:02:43.790> clearly<00:02:44.000> see<00:02:44.090> the<00:02:44.300> difference

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:44.980 
over you can clearly see the difference

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:49.270 
over you can clearly see the difference
this<00:02:45.980> one<00:02:46.190> here<00:02:46.550> is<00:02:47.140> the<00:02:48.140> halogen<00:02:48.530> bulb<00:02:48.740> with

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:49.280 
this one here is the halogen bulb with

has 12 little LEDs on it this covers a

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:09.370 
has 12 little LEDs on it this covers a
great<00:03:06.740> distance<00:03:07.370> in<00:03:07.670> terms<00:03:08.420> of<00:03:08.900> the

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:09.380 
great distance in terms of the

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:11.920 
great distance in terms of the

00:03:26.979 --> 00:03:26.989 
run the life of them is a hell of a lot

00:03:26.989 --> 00:03:27.580 
run the life of them is a hell of a lot
longer

electrical<00:06:14.050> juices<00:06:15.050> shall<00:06:15.350> I<00:06:15.380> say<00:06:15.710> to<00:06:16.250> drip

00:06:16.450 --> 00:06:16.460 
electrical juices shall I say to drip

00:06:16.460 --> 00:06:18.219 
electrical juices shall I say to drip
into<00:06:16.610> the<00:06:16.820> water<00:06:17.030> so<00:06:17.539> it's<00:06:17.660> not<00:06:17.780> really<00:06:18.020> good

00:06:18.219 --> 00:06:18.229 
into the water so it's not really good

00:06:18.229 --> 00:06:20.770 
into the water so it's not really good
so<00:06:18.440> keep<00:06:19.220> watching<00:06:19.550> my<00:06:19.639> videos<00:06:19.669> I<00:06:20.240> think<00:06:20.660> I've

00:06:20.770 --> 00:06:20.780 
so keep watching my videos I think I've

00:06:20.780 --> 00:06:22.840 
so keep watching my videos I think I've
got<00:06:20.930> a<00:06:20.960> solution<00:06:21.110> for<00:06:21.530> this<00:06:21.680> and<00:06:22.010> I'm<00:06:22.550> gonna<00:06:22.669> do

00:06:22.840 --> 00:06:22.850 
got a solution for this and I'm gonna do

00:06:22.850 --> 00:06:25.960 
got a solution for this and I'm gonna do
an<00:06:22.940> update<00:06:23.240> video<00:06:23.389> onto<00:06:24.200> how<00:06:24.320> to<00:06:24.380> fix<00:06:24.680> it<00:06:24.970> but

00:06:25.960 --> 00:06:25.970

00:06:25.970 --> 00:06:27.760 
an update video onto how to fix it but
still<00:06:26.270> I<00:06:26.510> would<00:06:26.780> recommend<00:06:27.260> getting<00:06:27.500> these

00:06:27.760 --> 00:06:27.770 
still I would recommend getting these

00:06:27.770 --> 00:06:31.210 
still I would recommend getting these

00:06:31.210 --> 00:06:31.220 
because when you do the solution there

00:06:31.220 --> 00:06:32.650 
because when you do the solution there
are<00:06:31.250> hell<00:06:31.669> of<00:06:31.789> a<00:06:31.850> lot<00:06:31.970> cheaper<00:06:32.000> than<00:06:32.450> buying

00:06:32.650 --> 00:06:32.660 
are hell of a lot cheaper than buying

00:06:32.660 --> 00:06:36.760 
are hell of a lot cheaper than buying
