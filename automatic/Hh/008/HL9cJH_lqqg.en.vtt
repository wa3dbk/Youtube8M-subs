first time we got to play online with
the<00:00:17.720> Alpha<00:00:18.140> with<00:00:18.980> alpha<00:00:19.580> backers<00:00:19.939> and<00:00:20.150> it<00:00:20.600> was

00:00:20.679 --> 00:00:20.689 
the Alpha with alpha backers and it was

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:23.740 
the Alpha with alpha backers and it was
very<00:00:20.810> exciting<00:00:21.410> I<00:00:21.590> had<00:00:21.890> my<00:00:22.180> my<00:00:23.180> first<00:00:23.450> brutal

00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:23.750

here<00:02:37.459> we're<00:02:37.640> sneaking<00:02:38.000> up<00:02:38.150> on<00:02:38.269> a<00:02:38.329> sidewinder

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:39.640 
here we're sneaking up on a sidewinder

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:41.890 
here we're sneaking up on a sidewinder
we<00:02:40.640> can<00:02:40.790> see<00:02:40.970> that<00:02:41.120> he<00:02:41.239> hasn't<00:02:41.390> really<00:02:41.780> got

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:41.900 
we can see that he hasn't really got

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:43.660 
we can see that he hasn't really got
much<00:02:42.049> cargoes<00:02:42.590> so<00:02:42.890> we'll<00:02:43.099> just<00:02:43.340> leave<00:02:43.489> him

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:43.670 
much cargoes so we'll just leave him

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:47.380 
much cargoes so we'll just leave him
alone<00:02:43.940> for<00:02:44.209> now<00:02:44.299> and<00:02:45.129> over<00:02:46.129> here<00:02:46.159> we've<00:02:46.459> got<00:02:46.489> an

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:47.390 
alone for now and over here we've got an

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:49.300 
alone for now and over here we've got an
anaconda<00:02:47.959> there<00:02:48.200> anacondas<00:02:48.799> a<00:02:48.829> much<00:02:49.069> bigger

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:49.310 
anaconda there anacondas a much bigger

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:51.640 
anaconda there anacondas a much bigger
ship<00:02:49.609> and<00:02:49.819> we<00:02:49.909> could<00:02:50.090> see<00:02:50.120> that<00:02:50.659> he's<00:02:51.349> got<00:02:51.500> lots

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:51.650 
ship and we could see that he's got lots

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:54.129 
ship and we could see that he's got lots
of<00:02:51.829> cargo<00:02:52.159> to<00:02:52.190> pick<00:02:52.430> up<00:02:52.609> but<00:02:53.180> he's<00:02:53.750> also<00:02:53.959> very

00:02:54.129 --> 00:02:54.139 
of cargo to pick up but he's also very

00:02:54.139 --> 00:02:55.869 
of cargo to pick up but he's also very
capable<00:02:54.709> of<00:02:54.829> defending<00:02:55.040> himself<00:02:55.310> so<00:02:55.730> we'll

00:02:55.869 --> 00:02:55.879 
capable of defending himself so we'll

00:02:55.879 --> 00:03:01.569 
capable of defending himself so we'll
leave<00:02:56.000> him<00:02:56.239> alone<00:03:00.040> finding<00:03:01.040> another<00:03:01.280> side

00:03:01.569 --> 00:03:01.579 
leave him alone finding another side

00:03:01.579 --> 00:03:04.809 
leave him alone finding another side
wonder<00:03:02.030> if<00:03:02.450> you<00:03:02.629> target<00:03:02.870> the<00:03:03.280> cargo<00:03:04.280> hatch<00:03:04.459> we

00:03:04.809 --> 00:03:04.819 
wonder if you target the cargo hatch we

00:03:04.819 --> 00:03:07.899 
wonder if you target the cargo hatch we
can<00:03:04.970> then<00:03:05.120> attack<00:03:05.420> and<00:03:05.980> which<00:03:06.980> will<00:03:07.159> then<00:03:07.280> when

00:03:07.899 --> 00:03:07.909 
can then attack and which will then when

00:03:07.909 --> 00:03:09.220 
can then attack and which will then when
he's<00:03:08.030> when<00:03:08.269> you've<00:03:08.389> beaten<00:03:08.599> him<00:03:08.720> you'll<00:03:09.019> get

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:09.230 
he's when you've beaten him you'll get

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:12.539 
he's when you've beaten him you'll get
the<00:03:09.700> cargo<00:03:10.700> pod<00:03:11.450> that<00:03:11.629> you<00:03:11.720> can<00:03:11.900> then<00:03:12.049> collect

00:03:12.539 --> 00:03:12.549 
the cargo pod that you can then collect

00:03:12.549 --> 00:03:15.129 
the cargo pod that you can then collect
but<00:03:13.549> you<00:03:13.639> will<00:03:13.760> get<00:03:13.879> a<00:03:13.940> bounty<00:03:14.359> for<00:03:14.750> doing<00:03:14.989> that

00:03:15.129 --> 00:03:15.139 
but you will get a bounty for doing that

00:03:15.139 --> 00:03:17.440 
but you will get a bounty for doing that
so<00:03:15.409> you<00:03:15.470> get<00:03:15.650> a<00:03:15.680> bounty<00:03:16.129> for<00:03:16.730> attacking<00:03:17.209> him

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:17.450 
so you get a bounty for attacking him

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:19.690 
so you get a bounty for attacking him
and<00:03:17.629> then<00:03:18.349> a<00:03:18.379> bounty<00:03:18.769> for<00:03:18.980> actually<00:03:19.459> killing

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:19.700 
and then a bounty for actually killing

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:21.370 
and then a bounty for actually killing
him

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:21.380 
him

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:23.650
