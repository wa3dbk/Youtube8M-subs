and<00:03:08.950> that<00:03:09.040> mean<00:03:09.190> it's<00:03:09.340> something<00:03:09.790> wrong

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:10.690 
and that mean it's something wrong

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:13.770 
and that mean it's something wrong
happened<00:03:11.140> and<00:03:11.319> you'll<00:03:11.440> just<00:03:11.680> have<00:03:11.860> to<00:03:12.660> do<00:03:13.660> it

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:13.780 
happened and you'll just have to do it

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:17.640 
happened and you'll just have to do it
over<00:03:13.980> it's<00:03:14.980> not<00:03:15.220> that<00:03:15.370> difficult<00:03:16.080> see<00:03:17.080> this<00:03:17.470> is

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:17.650 
over it's not that difficult see this is

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:20.280 
over it's not that difficult see this is
what<00:03:17.799> the<00:03:18.070> screen<00:03:18.280> should<00:03:18.430> appear<00:03:18.790> as<00:03:19.060> if<00:03:19.570> it

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:20.290 
what the screen should appear as if it

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:26.220 
what the screen should appear as if it
worked<00:03:20.760> the<00:03:21.760> Big<00:03:21.970> Z<00:03:22.470> zorro<00:03:23.470> I<00:03:23.620> guess<00:03:23.980> and<00:03:25.230> it

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:26.230 
worked the Big Z zorro I guess and it
