00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:52.460 
as you can see at the base of the bullet
right<00:02:49.560> down<00:02:49.769> here<00:02:51.170> hopefully<00:02:52.170> get<00:02:52.350> this

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:52.470 
right down here hopefully get this

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:55.880 
right down here hopefully get this
camera<00:02:52.680> to<00:02:52.799> focus<00:02:54.290> when<00:02:55.290> you<00:02:55.410> start<00:02:55.680> getting

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:55.890 
camera to focus when you start getting

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:58.190 
camera to focus when you start getting
this<00:02:56.070> way<00:02:56.450> the<00:02:57.450> diameter<00:02:57.900> of<00:02:57.959> the<00:02:58.049> bullet

00:02:58.190 --> 00:02:58.200 
this way the diameter of the bullet

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:03.620 
this way the diameter of the bullet
actually<00:02:59.480> gets<00:03:00.480> smaller<00:03:01.670> and<00:03:02.670> like<00:03:03.510> the

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:03.630 
actually gets smaller and like the

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:08.090 
actually gets smaller and like the
Winchester<00:03:04.340> expert<00:03:05.340> 22s<00:03:05.850> is<00:03:06.600> a<00:03:07.290> very<00:03:07.590> very

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:08.100 
Winchester expert 22s is a very very

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:12.910 
Winchester expert 22s is a very very
deep<00:03:08.430> hollow<00:03:08.640> point<00:03:09.950> in<00:03:11.120> these<00:03:12.120> our

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:12.920 
deep hollow point in these our

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:18.380 
deep hollow point in these our
hypervelocity<00:03:13.920> they're<00:03:14.400> not<00:03:14.700> subsonic<00:03:17.390> you

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:18.390 
hypervelocity they're not subsonic you

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:21.979 
hypervelocity they're not subsonic you
can<00:03:18.510> still<00:03:18.690> use<00:03:18.870> them<00:03:18.989> for<00:03:19.170> fraggin<00:03:20.750> least<00:03:21.750> I

00:03:21.979 --> 00:03:21.989 
can still use them for fraggin least I

00:03:21.989 --> 00:03:23.509 
can still use them for fraggin least I
do<00:03:22.049> a<00:03:22.230> lot<00:03:22.560> of<00:03:22.590> people<00:03:22.920> like<00:03:23.130> all<00:03:23.280> your

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:37.440 
mucky and there's about a good 8 10

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:42.979 
mucky and there's about a good 8 10
inches<00:03:37.470> of<00:03:38.130> just<00:03:39.170> muddy<00:03:40.940> gunk<00:03:41.940> that's<00:03:42.780> where

00:03:42.979 --> 00:03:42.989 
inches of just muddy gunk that's where

00:03:42.989 --> 00:03:45.199 
inches of just muddy gunk that's where
organic<00:03:43.500> material<00:03:43.890> that's<00:03:43.920> died<00:03:44.400> off<00:03:44.579> and<00:03:44.609> has

00:03:45.199 --> 00:03:45.209 
organic material that's died off and has

00:03:45.209 --> 00:03:47.390 
organic material that's died off and has
settled<00:03:45.420> into<00:03:45.569> the<00:03:45.690> bottom<00:03:45.989> it's<00:03:46.889> almost<00:03:47.160> like

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:47.400 
settled into the bottom it's almost like

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:50.840 
settled into the bottom it's almost like
a<00:03:47.430> swamp<00:03:47.989> until<00:03:48.989> you<00:03:49.350> get<00:03:49.560> out<00:03:49.859> where<00:03:50.430> the

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:50.850 
a swamp until you get out where the

00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:52.190 
a swamp until you get out where the
water<00:03:50.970> gets<00:03:51.180> a<00:03:51.329> lot<00:03:51.450> deeper<00:03:51.690> but<00:03:51.989> I<00:03:52.049> mean

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:52.200 
water gets a lot deeper but I mean

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:54.069 
water gets a lot deeper but I mean
you're<00:03:52.290> not<00:03:52.380> shooting<00:03:52.709> anything<00:03:53.130> that's<00:03:53.519> not

00:03:54.069 --> 00:03:54.079 
you're not shooting anything that's not

00:03:54.079 --> 00:03:57.890 
you're not shooting anything that's not

for<00:05:06.120> plinking<00:05:06.330> and<00:05:06.659> target<00:05:06.960> shooting<00:05:07.580> are<00:05:08.580> the

00:05:10.629 --> 00:05:10.639 
for plinking and target shooting are the

00:05:10.639 --> 00:05:16.670 
for plinking and target shooting are the
Remington<00:05:11.990> Thunderbolts<00:05:14.090> so<00:05:15.090> I<00:05:15.680> think

00:05:16.670 --> 00:05:16.680 
Remington Thunderbolts so I think

00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:20.980 
Remington Thunderbolts so I think
everybody's<00:05:17.340> heard<00:05:17.690> about<00:05:18.690> them<00:05:18.930> or<00:05:19.320> see<00:05:19.620> them

00:05:20.980 --> 00:05:20.990 
everybody's heard about them or see them

00:05:20.990 --> 00:05:25.939 
everybody's heard about them or see them
at<00:05:21.990> with<00:05:22.380> that<00:05:22.590> said<00:05:22.889> that's<00:05:23.699> about<00:05:23.880> it<00:05:24.949> hope
