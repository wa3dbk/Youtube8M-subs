I had seen where Barbara had taken other
needle<00:00:20.460> points<00:00:20.880> and<00:00:21.029> mounted<00:00:21.449> them<00:00:21.600> on<00:00:22.369> paper

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:23.369 
needle points and mounted them on paper

in<00:00:27.480> our<00:00:27.599> keys<00:00:27.869> I<00:00:28.310> had<00:00:29.310> these<00:00:29.460> papers<00:00:30.000> for<00:00:30.240> a

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:30.269 
in our keys I had these papers for a

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:31.759 
in our keys I had these papers for a
while<00:00:30.420> I<00:00:30.449> couldn't<00:00:30.960> decide<00:00:31.289> what<00:00:31.439> to<00:00:31.590> do<00:00:31.740> with

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:31.769 
while I couldn't decide what to do with

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:34.490 
while I couldn't decide what to do with
them<00:00:32.040> and<00:00:32.189> then<00:00:32.279> it<00:00:32.369> dawned<00:00:32.669> on<00:00:32.790> me<00:00:32.850> that<00:00:33.500> the

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:34.500 
them and then it dawned on me that the

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:36.530 
them and then it dawned on me that the
Celtic<00:00:34.950> illuminated<00:00:35.520> manuscript<00:00:36.210> pages

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:36.540 
Celtic illuminated manuscript pages

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:40.090 
Celtic illuminated manuscript pages
would<00:00:36.930> look<00:00:37.110> fabulous<00:00:38.329> superimposed<00:00:39.329> on<00:00:39.629> this

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:40.100 
would look fabulous superimposed on this

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:43.130 
would look fabulous superimposed on this
so<00:00:41.100> it's<00:00:41.309> what<00:00:41.670> you<00:00:41.820> have<00:00:42.090> is<00:00:42.510> you<00:00:42.840> have<00:00:42.870> the

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:43.140 
so it's what you have is you have the

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:45.799 
so it's what you have is you have the
needlepoint<00:00:43.469> and<00:00:44.160> then<00:00:44.940> you<00:00:45.030> have<00:00:45.210> this<00:00:45.390> as<00:00:45.750> a

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:45.809 
needlepoint and then you have this as a

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:48.650 
needlepoint and then you have this as a
background<00:00:46.260> or<00:00:46.770> a<00:00:46.800> frame<00:00:47.160> around<00:00:47.190> it<00:00:47.789> to<00:00:48.629> make

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660 
background or a frame around it to make

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:52.240 
background or a frame around it to make
it<00:00:48.809> a<00:00:48.989> little<00:00:49.140> more<00:00:49.260> interesting<00:00:49.770> I<00:00:50.600> also

00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:52.250 
it a little more interesting I also

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:56.630 
it a little more interesting I also

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
trunk buoyed by continuing the

00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:00.539 
needlepoint the parchment onto the

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:04.160 
needlepoint the parchment onto the
needlepoint<00:01:01.280> so<00:01:02.280> when<00:01:02.550> they<00:01:03.080> when<00:01:04.080> they're

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:07.550 
needlepoint so when they when they're
framed<00:01:04.880> they<00:01:05.880> will<00:01:06.090> merge<00:01:06.360> into<00:01:06.960> one<00:01:07.110> single

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 
framed they will merge into one single

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:10.010 
framed they will merge into one single
piece<00:01:07.860> now<00:01:08.549> this<00:01:08.700> piece<00:01:09.000> was<00:01:09.780> just

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020 
piece now this piece was just

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:12.550 
piece now this piece was just
needlepointed<00:01:10.350> it<00:01:11.250> has<00:01:11.460> to<00:01:11.640> be<00:01:11.670> blocked

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:12.560 
needlepointed it has to be blocked

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:14.359 
needlepointed it has to be blocked
blocking<00:01:13.560> is<00:01:13.680> where<00:01:13.860> they<00:01:13.950> take<00:01:14.220> the

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369 
blocking is where they take the

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:17.330 
blocking is where they take the
needlepoint<00:01:14.700> and<00:01:15.090> stretch<00:01:15.509> back<00:01:15.869> into<00:01:16.409> the

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
needlepoint and stretch back into the

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:20.240 
needlepoint and stretch back into the
rectangular<00:01:17.909> shape<00:01:18.740> most<00:01:19.740> the<00:01:19.890> time<00:01:20.040> when<00:01:20.189> you

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
rectangular shape most the time when you

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:22.249 
rectangular shape most the time when you
need<00:01:20.430> a<00:01:20.460> point<00:01:20.759> inevitably<00:01:21.240> it<00:01:21.720> comes<00:01:21.960> off

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:22.259 
need a point inevitably it comes off

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:24.230 
need a point inevitably it comes off
angle<00:01:23.100> so<00:01:23.280> that<00:01:23.310> has<00:01:23.580> to<00:01:23.670> be<00:01:23.729> straightened

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240 
angle so that has to be straightened

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:27.050 
angle so that has to be straightened
then<00:01:24.900> I<00:01:24.930> take<00:01:25.229> it<00:01:25.380> to<00:01:25.470> the<00:01:25.560> framer<00:01:25.890> this<00:01:26.759> gets

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
then I take it to the framer this gets

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:29.179 
then I take it to the framer this gets
drawing<00:01:27.450> mounted<00:01:27.990> or<00:01:28.110> blue<00:01:28.470> whatever<00:01:28.680> and

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:29.189 
drawing mounted or blue whatever and

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:31.490 
drawing mounted or blue whatever and
then<00:01:29.670> this<00:01:29.820> gets<00:01:30.000> attached<00:01:30.450> on<00:01:30.869> top<00:01:31.140> of<00:01:31.350> it's

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.500 
then this gets attached on top of it's

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:34.330 
then this gets attached on top of it's
becoming<00:01:31.860> tired

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:34.340 

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:43.220 

since<00:01:35.340> the<00:01:35.880> pages<00:01:39.170> we're<00:01:40.170> two-sided<00:01:40.980> I<00:01:42.230> would

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:43.230 
since the pages we're two-sided I would

00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:46.100 
since the pages we're two-sided I would
sometimes<00:01:44.510> what<00:01:45.510> I<00:01:45.540> was<00:01:45.750> trying<00:01:45.990> to<00:01:46.020> be

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.110 
sometimes what I was trying to be

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:48.590 
sometimes what I was trying to be
economical<00:01:46.800> I<00:01:47.010> cut<00:01:47.730> out<00:01:47.880> the<00:01:48.060> middle<00:01:48.390> piece

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600 
economical I cut out the middle piece

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:54.200 
economical I cut out the middle piece
and<00:01:49.820> then<00:01:52.040> sometimes<00:01:53.040> collage<00:01:53.490> them<00:01:53.790> totally

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.210 
and then sometimes collage them totally

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:58.280 
and then sometimes collage them totally
together<00:01:55.490> totally<00:01:56.490> out<00:01:56.640> of<00:01:56.670> context<00:01:57.300> to<00:01:57.660> make

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:58.290 
together totally out of context to make

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:02.600 
together totally out of context to make
frames<00:01:58.800> for<00:01:59.220> other<00:01:59.490> pieces<00:02:01.340> so<00:02:02.340> that's<00:02:02.520> how

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:02.610 
frames for other pieces so that's how

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:07.100 
frames for other pieces so that's how
this<00:02:02.820> project<00:02:03.120> came<00:02:03.510> to<00:02:04.140> be<00:02:04.290> I<00:02:05.840> wrote<00:02:06.840> my
