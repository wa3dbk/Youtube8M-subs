00:00:03.920 --> 00:00:08.370
 We are in residential celebration such 

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:09.840
 this time we are going to tell you the 

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:12.300
 best tricks and the latest trends 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:14.370
 to decorate a house of 116 meters 

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:17.660
 squares with three bedrooms and two 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:17.660
 bathrooms one of them en suite 

00:00:19.450 --> 00:00:22.810
 we are in the room that is a 

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:24.820
 very square distribution where we have 

00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:26.860
 created two very different environments 

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:28.570
 living room and dining room in the living room 

00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:31.000
 used a range of gray tones 

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:32.920
 whites and turquoise blue that is a 

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.870
 very fashionable color and that contributes a lot 

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:37.480
 luminosity and also highlight 

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:39.190
 that we have used geometric leg of 

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:40.900
 cock that then I will tell you a use that 

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:42.670
 we have made it very fun and special and 

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:44.470
 that contributes a lot to the decoration as well 

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:46.000
 like some seats with big thumbtacks 

00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:47.500
 that is also something that is in 

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.790
 trend and that takes two years with 

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:52.080
 us and that at the moment does not have visos 

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:52.080
 believe it 

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:57.140
 in the dining room we have highlighted the color 

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:58.550
 turquoise putting a textured paper and 

00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:00.410
 as I said before we used the 

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:02.270
 houndstooth in the chair making a 

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:04.460
 wink of the cushions that together with the 

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:07.540
 upholstered in leather sideboard gives us a 

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:07.540
 chic and trendy touch 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:22.020
 in this room what is key in the 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:23.730
 decoration is the use we have made with 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:26.790
 the papers we used a mural of 

00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:28.260
 world map in red and blue tones that 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:30.810
 we have highlighted with the same range 

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:32.070
 chromatic with a striped paper in this 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:34.350
 room we wanted to run away from the 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:35.850
 typical children's decoration and for that 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:37.860
 we have used a resource that is very 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:39.780
 fashionable that are the cages that we have 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:41.880
 filled with garlands to give light and 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:46.040
 environment and we have also used a 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:46.040
 paper with birds in pink hues 

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:53.180
 in the main room we have wanted 

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:56.030
 look for balance using tones 

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:58.220
 minks and baixas that give us light and 

00:01:56.030 --> 00:02:00.440
 calm in the room we have made a 

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:02.120
 headboard using two types of skins 

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:03.440
 in two colors and we have used the 

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:05.660
 same resource the inverse of the 

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:07.400
 cushions in addition to give you a note of 

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:09.710
 color we have added plum colors 

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:12.130
 and roses in details like the cushions and 

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:12.130
 curtains
