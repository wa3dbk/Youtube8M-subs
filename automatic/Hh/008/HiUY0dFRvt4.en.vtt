00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:30.530 
district graffiti design oh my god and
the<00:01:29.070> wheels<00:01:29.280> are<00:01:29.579> actually<00:01:29.939> like<00:01:30.119> proper

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.540 
the wheels are actually like proper

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:33.980 
the wheels are actually like proper
metalcore<00:01:31.140> ones<00:01:31.380> but<00:01:32.130> just<00:01:32.460> passed<00:01:32.700> it<00:01:32.990> we

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990 
metalcore ones but just passed it we

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:38.630 
metalcore ones but just passed it we
look<00:01:34.170> how<00:01:34.320> fast<00:01:34.530> they<00:01:34.710> spin<00:01:37.220> make<00:01:38.220> a<00:01:38.250> weird

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 
look how fast they spin make a weird

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:41.510 
look how fast they spin make a weird
noise<00:01:38.880> at<00:01:39.119> start<00:01:39.420> but<00:01:39.659> I<00:01:39.869> guess<00:01:40.590> just<00:01:40.740> yeah<00:01:41.490> I

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
noise at start but I guess just yeah I

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:44.240 
noise at start but I guess just yeah I
guess<00:01:41.790> you<00:01:41.939> have<00:01:42.090> to<00:01:42.119> use<00:01:42.329> them<00:01:42.799> to<00:01:43.799> be<00:01:43.950> able<00:01:44.040> to

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250 
guess you have to use them to be able to

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:47.389 
guess you have to use them to be able to
get<00:01:44.490> them<00:01:44.640> kicked<00:01:44.850> in<00:01:45.530> so<00:01:46.530> they<00:01:46.799> are<00:01:46.920> the<00:01:47.159> bite

00:01:47.389 --> 00:01:47.399 
get them kicked in so they are the bite

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:49.539 
get them kicked in so they are the bite
doesn't<00:01:47.430> work<00:01:47.909> which<00:01:48.090> is<00:01:48.180> another<00:01:48.420> downer<00:01:48.750> but

00:01:49.539 --> 00:01:49.549 
doesn't work which is another downer but

00:01:49.549 --> 00:01:53.030 
doesn't work which is another downer but
they're<00:01:50.549> just<00:01:50.670> so<00:01:51.210> tall<00:01:51.740> compared<00:01:52.740> to<00:01:52.890> what<00:01:53.009> I

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:53.040 
they're just so tall compared to what I

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:55.190 
they're just so tall compared to what I
thought<00:01:53.369> they<00:01:53.520> were<00:01:53.700> and<00:01:54.329> they<00:01:54.720> take<00:01:54.930> up<00:01:55.110> your

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200
