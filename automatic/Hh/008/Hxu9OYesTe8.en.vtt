00:00:01.429 --> 00:00:05.460
 Welcome to the 

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:07.379
 filmfabrik to another special and 

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:09.110
 I have the same nose here to guest 

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:12.389
 which was already there a thousand times 

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:14.490
 marius, what's up with today ? 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:16.619
 we remember you at kenny valley 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:19.410
 actually to the film the legend of 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:20.340
 beowulf from 2007 with angelina jolie and 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:22.470
 anthony hopkins 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:24.359
 the movie was pretty much done then 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:26.039
 when he appeared but rather failed 

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:27.660
 has its own until today 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:29.670
 Production costs re-recorded 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:31.800
 robert zemeckis was in charge 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:34.320
 and he has been so wonderful to us before 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:36.059
 movies given like forrest gump comtec 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:38.309
 or the back to the future trilogy 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:40.200
 Today you learn what the main reason 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:43.079
 for that was the legend of beowulf 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:45.090
 despite his big budget of 130 

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:47.149
 millions of dollars so watchers 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:49.350
 badly arrived and that there was one 

00:00:47.149 --> 00:00:50.850
 Scientifically verifiable effect 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:52.469
 Behind it the film is moving 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:54.270
 over his entire term namely in the 

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:56.760
 so-called uncanny valley 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:58.710
 english at kenny valley 1970 bach 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:00.960
 masahiko mori a robotics out 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:02.760
 Japan about the phenomenon that the more one 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:04.229
 robot one person ends it too 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:06.090
 the willingness of the people is 

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:08.280
 to identify with the opposite 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:10.020
 you could say that more here 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:12.510
 robot or an animated character 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:14.220
 toy to avatar whatever the 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:16.530
 humans resemble the larger of the straight 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:18.659
 it is not true that is true 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:20.610
 Man finds artificially figurines 

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:21.869
 look very different than the human but 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:24.110
 having your own consciousness has a lot 

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:25.740
 more familiar one is more willing than you 

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:28.020
 Identification figures in a movie too 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:29.460
 accept for example r2d2 volley the 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:30.180
 Transformers take a look at this one 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:32.340
 count 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:34.860
 down the x-axis you can see the degree 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:36.960
 the realism of individual figures that is 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:39.479
 as further to the right we on the x-axis 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:42.150
 the more similar the figure is to the 

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:44.130
 people left at the y-axis is the 

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:46.259
 degree of familiarity that is how much 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:47.850
 we figures as identification carriers 

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:48.720
 jonas accepted a few times 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:50.299
 figures a 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:54.149
 we see from left to right here 

00:01:50.299 --> 00:01:56.640
 r2d2 from star wars volley rcds best 

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:58.770
 franzi 3p homer simpson mister 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:00.810
 incredible of the incredible tom 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:03.360
 hanks as the conductor from the polar 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:05.340
 express beowulf from the legend of 

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:06.600
 beowulf and far right then one 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:08.250
 right people 

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:10.140
 we have harrison ford look at you 

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:12.600
 Now at times what it spends here also 

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:13.770
 too sweet and a good sidekick volley 

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:15.959
 a bit with his childish eyes 

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:16.980
 human c3po can talk and it 

00:02:15.959 --> 00:02:19.170
 built like a real man 

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:21.270
 cougar is not serious in principle 

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:22.860
 also built with would have to see incredible 

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:24.120
 like a computer animated person 

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:27.060
 and now what happens is interesting 

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:28.500
 who wolf and tom hanks are possible 

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:30.360
 made human-like 

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:32.420
 how does it affect you on the impact 

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:34.380
 you sympathetic cut charismatic 

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:36.690
 probably not when a whole 

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:38.580
 obvious machine like r2d2 something 

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:40.440
 human power then becomes his own 

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:42.569
 mute written if you are something human 

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:44.370
 and then it's typical to say yes 

00:02:42.569 --> 00:02:46.140
 well he is just an aspect roosevelt 

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:47.130
 something as human as possible 

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:48.660
 for example, tom hanks from the 

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:50.640
 Some people and polar express 

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:52.200
 something like that will do the wrong thing 

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:54.330
 taken when the spectator is something 

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:55.950
 is put down and said subconsciously 

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:58.290
 will look here for the rest 

00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:59.819
 of the film as a normal human then 

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:01.590
 then this being is also measured like this 

00:02:59.819 --> 00:03:03.269
 as a human and as soon as this was 

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:05.250
 something unnatural will do sooner 

00:03:03.269 --> 00:03:07.080
 negatively rated in figures in the 

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:08.640
 to kenny because the movement falun once 

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:10.319
 after a while the cold in 

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:12.390
 the eyes open and the mechanics in the 

00:03:10.319 --> 00:03:14.730
 Movement pixar dreamworks and choir are 

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:16.530
 no stupid production studios and that 

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:18.600
 the problem with kenny valley is the 

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:20.370
 Exactly aware of them is exactly that 

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:22.500
 one of the reasons why in so many 

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:24.750
 animated films are not the protagonists 

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:26.760
 it is human in ratatouille 

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:28.769
 a rat in nemo we find 

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:30.660
 It's a fish in toy story 

00:03:28.769 --> 00:03:31.980
 toy cowboy and even if the 

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:33.900
 films have people in those 

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:36.000
 For example, main roles play the grandfather 

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:37.680
 karl in ab can me in the 

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:39.630
 incredible or hicks in 

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:41.010
 Taming the dragon is made easy 

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:43.049
 placed on it that the figures still 

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:44.850
 a very clear degree of artificiality 

00:03:43.049 --> 00:03:46.260
 it is avoided that the 

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:47.160
 people as realistic as possible 

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:48.900
 appearance 

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:50.820
 they move a little and more naturally 

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:53.220
 and her proportions are cartoon has 

00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:54.930
 robert zemeckis of both polar 

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:57.060
 express as well as in the legend of 

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:58.920
 Beowulf has been the director 

00:03:57.060 --> 00:04:00.450
 to be king of the kenny valley 

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:02.850
 He has a production company called 

00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:04.140
 image movers also has milow and 

00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:06.510
 mars worked 

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:08.489
 a movie the massive in kenny valley 

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:10.069
 infected and catastrophically flopped 

00:04:08.489 --> 00:04:12.439
 have a look 

00:04:10.069 --> 00:04:14.569
 a born of the hell of this thing 

00:04:12.439 --> 00:04:16.639
 is replica youtube is a so-called 

00:04:14.569 --> 00:04:19.430
 act reuth and was at the university 

00:04:16.639 --> 00:04:21.259
 This robot is made in Tokyo 

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:23.150
 look as human as possible and 

00:04:21.259 --> 00:04:23.720
 the blinking breathes and responds 

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:25.370
 contact 

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:27.650
 I do not know how you are but on 

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:29.810
 This thing scary seems to me 

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:31.130
 grabs the human similarity though 

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:32.960
 very high but still a good one 

00:04:31.130 --> 00:04:35.210
 piece of the 100 percent and 

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:36.740
 while it's right in the middle of it 

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:38.690
 kenny berlin emergency you because even 

00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:39.110
 more figures from the at kenny valley 

00:04:38.690 --> 00:04:40.490
 on 

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:42.650
 then write us in the 

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:44.090
 comments what is going on also has one 

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:45.680
 video made on the topic there I am 

00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:47.780
 but there is also two days in it 

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:50.030
 after our video online linked

 I'll email you as soon as it's online up here 

00:04:50.030 --> 00:04:52.190

 I hope to see you next time 

00:04:52.190 --> 00:04:56.150
 again watch movie in the cinema 

00:04:54.050 --> 00:04:58.449
 see you next time with marius von was 

00:04:56.150 --> 00:04:58.449
 goes off
