after that point the series starts to

00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:25.640 
after that point the series starts to
feel<00:05:23.700> completely<00:05:24.480> different<00:05:24.930> but<00:05:25.440> you<00:05:25.530> know

the series
I<00:05:29.340> enjoyed<00:05:29.910> the<00:05:30.090> traveling<00:05:30.510> mini<00:05:30.750> arc<00:05:30.960> a<00:05:31.110> lot

I enjoyed the traveling mini arc a lot

00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:33.860 
I enjoyed the traveling mini arc a lot
especially<00:05:31.950> the<00:05:32.250> radio<00:05:32.610> station<00:05:33.000> sequence<00:05:33.450> it

00:05:33.860 --> 00:05:33.870 
especially the radio station sequence it

00:05:33.870 --> 00:05:35.780 
especially the radio station sequence it
was<00:05:33.990> kind<00:05:34.320> of<00:05:34.410> tragic<00:05:34.950> knowing<00:05:35.280> that<00:05:35.430> if<00:05:35.610> they

00:05:35.780 --> 00:05:35.790 
was kind of tragic knowing that if they

00:05:35.790 --> 00:05:38.030 
was kind of tragic knowing that if they
were<00:05:35.850> just<00:05:36.060> a<00:05:36.270> little<00:05:36.750> bit<00:05:37.080> earlier<00:05:37.470> they

00:05:38.030 --> 00:05:38.040 
were just a little bit earlier they

00:05:38.040 --> 00:05:39.560 
were just a little bit earlier they
could<00:05:38.190> have<00:05:38.280> saved<00:05:38.520> that<00:05:38.610> girl<00:05:38.880> and<00:05:39.120> we<00:05:39.420> would

00:05:39.560 --> 00:05:39.570 
could have saved that girl and we would

00:05:39.570 --> 00:05:41.390 
could have saved that girl and we would
have<00:05:39.690> a<00:05:39.720> new<00:05:39.930> character<00:05:40.170> in<00:05:40.440> the<00:05:40.530> series<00:05:40.770> but

00:05:41.390 --> 00:05:41.400 
have a new character in the series but

00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:44.540 
have a new character in the series but
the<00:05:41.820> Mongkok<00:05:42.210> I<00:05:42.330> decided<00:05:42.690> no<00:05:43.350> it<00:05:43.770> appears<00:05:43.950> she

00:05:44.540 --> 00:05:44.550 
the Mongkok I decided no it appears she

00:05:44.550 --> 00:05:46.520 
the Mongkok I decided no it appears she
had<00:05:44.669> committed<00:05:44.940> suicide<00:05:45.540> or<00:05:45.810> transformed

00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:46.530 
had committed suicide or transformed

00:05:46.530 --> 00:05:48.350 
had committed suicide or transformed
into<00:05:46.740> a<00:05:46.860> zombie<00:05:47.070> but<00:05:47.669> it's<00:05:47.820> weird<00:05:48.060> that<00:05:48.180> we

00:05:48.350 --> 00:05:48.360 
into a zombie but it's weird that we

00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:50.450 
into a zombie but it's weird that we
actually<00:05:48.720> never<00:05:48.810> saw<00:05:49.200> her<00:05:49.380> corpse<00:05:49.860> I<00:05:50.160> don't

00:05:50.450 --> 00:05:50.460 
actually never saw her corpse I don't

00:05:50.460 --> 00:05:51.920 
actually never saw her corpse I don't
think<00:05:50.610> a<00:05:50.700> zombie<00:05:51.000> in<00:05:51.090> this<00:05:51.210> reality<00:05:51.480> is<00:05:51.660> so

00:05:51.920 --> 00:05:51.930 
think a zombie in this reality is so

00:05:51.930 --> 00:05:53.570 
think a zombie in this reality is so
fast<00:05:52.260> that<00:05:52.410> it<00:05:52.590> can<00:05:52.710> disappear<00:05:53.070> out<00:05:53.220> of<00:05:53.340> sight

00:05:53.570 --> 00:05:53.580 
fast that it can disappear out of sight

00:05:53.580 --> 00:05:55.640 
fast that it can disappear out of sight
in<00:05:53.760> that<00:05:53.820> room<00:05:54.210> that<00:05:54.480> quickly<00:05:54.810> it<00:05:55.230> wasn't

00:05:55.640 --> 00:05:55.650 
in that room that quickly it wasn't

00:05:55.650 --> 00:05:58.159 
in that room that quickly it wasn't
exactly<00:05:56.160> clear<00:05:56.700> what<00:05:56.880> noise<00:05:57.390> she's<00:05:57.720> making

00:05:58.159 --> 00:05:58.169 
exactly clear what noise she's making

00:05:58.169 --> 00:05:59.600 
exactly clear what noise she's making
before<00:05:58.350> the<00:05:58.620> characters<00:05:58.980> walked<00:05:59.220> into<00:05:59.580> that

00:05:59.600 --> 00:05:59.610 
before the characters walked into that

00:05:59.610 --> 00:06:00.260 
before the characters walked into that
room<00:05:59.730> either

00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:00.270

00:06:03.200 --> 00:06:03.210 
who knows maybe she's still alive also

00:06:03.210 --> 00:06:05.210 
who knows maybe she's still alive also
the<00:06:03.480> day<00:06:03.600> one<00:06:03.780> else<00:06:03.990> noticed<00:06:04.620> that<00:06:04.770> Walking

that<00:06:06.960> was<00:06:07.080> pretty<00:06:07.169> cool<00:06:07.380> since<00:06:07.800> The<00:06:07.919> Walking

00:06:08.090 --> 00:06:08.100 
that was pretty cool since The Walking
