and also record pretty good video at
this<00:01:26.430> point<00:01:26.759> however<00:01:27.630> they're<00:01:28.380> not<00:01:28.650> as<00:01:28.890> sharp

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:29.189 
this point however they're not as sharp

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:32.450 
this point however they're not as sharp
as<00:01:30.170> one<00:01:31.170> of<00:01:31.200> these<00:01:31.380> cannons<00:01:31.890> that<00:01:31.920> I'm<00:01:32.130> talking

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
as one of these cannons that I'm talking

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:35.510 
as one of these cannons that I'm talking
about<00:01:32.549> would<00:01:32.909> be<00:01:33.119> now<00:01:34.100> from<00:01:35.100> my<00:01:35.250> personal

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:35.520 
about would be now from my personal

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:39.050 
about would be now from my personal
experience<00:01:36.590> the<00:01:37.590> Canon<00:01:37.979> 60d<00:01:38.310> that<00:01:38.759> I<00:01:38.790> have

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:39.060 
experience the Canon 60d that I have

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:46.100 
experience the Canon 60d that I have
here<00:01:39.710> pretty<00:01:40.710> much<00:01:41.240> I<00:01:42.259> chose<00:01:43.259> it<00:01:44.869> more<00:01:45.869> so

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.110 
here pretty much I chose it more so

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:49.330 
here pretty much I chose it more so
because<00:01:46.290> of<00:01:46.470> the<00:01:46.710> build<00:01:47.009> quality<00:01:47.220> it<00:01:48.000> feels

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:49.340 
because of the build quality it feels

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:53.030

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:57.200 
solid in the hand compared to the t3i
t3r<00:01:53.850> feels<00:01:54.180> really<00:01:54.630> plasticky<00:01:55.939> one<00:01:56.939> other

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:57.210
