00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.460
 now let's start with the medium then 2 

00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:08.180
 12 

00:00:09.190 --> 00:00:13.490
 32 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:16.000
 4 

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:16.000
 2 

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:22.350
 32 

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:25.350
 and change core from 2 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:25.350
 1 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:28.470
 23 

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:32.560
 24 

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:38.980
 23 

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:42.430
 2 and we do it on all if the strings 

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:44.590
 so then we change the initial finger 

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:49.920
 so let's start with the third finger and how 

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:49.920
 you can understand it will be 3 1 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:52.980
 32 

00:00:53.950 --> 00:00:56.950
 34 

00:00:56.980 --> 00:01:01.470
 32 

00:00:59.150 --> 00:01:04.040
 horn change 3 

00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:10.100
 or not 

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:10.100
 32 34 

00:01:10.679 --> 00:01:16.630
 32 rope change 3 

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:18.960
 1 

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:18.960
 3 

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:22.270
 23 

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:37.659
 43 

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:38.760
 2 change string 31 slowly 32 34 

00:01:37.659 --> 00:01:42.360
 3 

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:48.370
 2 emilia on all if the ropes then remain 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:56.520
 the little finger as first finger then 41 

00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:58.170
 4 2 4 3 4 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:03.060
 2 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:03.060
 exchange 41 

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:06.140
 42 

00:02:06.409 --> 00:02:09.409
 43 

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:15.800
 42 rope change 4 

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:21.910
 1 

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:21.910
 4 2 4 

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:25.090
 34 

00:02:25.299 --> 00:02:34.329
 so so we would have started a 

00:02:29.739 --> 00:02:37.280
 strengthen the hand to give a position 

00:02:34.329 --> 00:02:41.030
 useful both for agreements and for 

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:42.889
 stairs and at the same time stood 

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:44.719
 starting to become familiar with i 

00:02:42.889 --> 00:02:47.480
 rope changes with the right hand 

00:02:44.719 --> 00:02:50.260
 remember here we only used the 

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:52.340
 drawn down because so 

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:53.959
 you will be able to concentrate more 

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:56.109
 on the aspect concerning the hand 

00:02:53.959 --> 00:02:56.109
 left
