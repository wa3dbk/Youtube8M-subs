00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:51.290 

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:57.719 

see<00:01:51.920> if<00:01:52.010> I<00:01:52.130> can<00:01:52.280> do<00:01:52.430> this

00:01:57.719 --> 00:01:57.729 

00:01:57.729 --> 00:02:01.800 

shredded<00:01:58.450> paper<00:01:58.600> works<00:01:58.930> great<00:01:59.350> for<00:02:00.810> starting

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:01.810 
shredded paper works great for starting

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:06.719 
shredded paper works great for starting
fires<00:02:04.620> let<00:02:05.620> that<00:02:05.800> burn<00:02:06.070> there<00:02:06.280> throw<00:02:06.490> some

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:06.729 
fires let that burn there throw some

00:02:06.729 --> 00:02:09.719 
fires let that burn there throw some
wood<00:02:06.880> on<00:02:06.940> there<00:02:07.330> and<00:02:08.009> come<00:02:09.009> back<00:02:09.039> after<00:02:09.429> its

00:02:09.719 --> 00:02:09.729 
wood on there and come back after its

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:12.840 
wood on there and come back after its
cooled<00:02:09.880> off<00:02:10.709> so<00:02:11.709> that'll<00:02:12.190> be<00:02:12.280> in<00:02:12.370> next<00:02:12.610> part<00:02:12.819> of

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:12.850 
cooled off so that'll be in next part of

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:18.810 
cooled off so that'll be in next part of
the<00:02:12.940> video<00:02:15.540> series<00:02:16.540> fire<00:02:17.080> going<00:02:17.500> get<00:02:18.490> the<00:02:18.610> pan

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:18.820 
the video series fire going get the pan

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:23.790 
the video series fire going get the pan
on<00:02:19.030> the<00:02:19.120> bottom<00:02:21.959> another<00:02:22.959> advantage<00:02:23.350> of<00:02:23.590> doing

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:23.800 
on the bottom another advantage of doing

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:26.520 
on the bottom another advantage of doing
this<00:02:23.980> is<00:02:24.190> I<00:02:24.880> get<00:02:25.209> to<00:02:25.360> clean<00:02:25.780> up<00:02:25.959> all<00:02:26.140> the<00:02:26.290> yard

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:26.530 
this is I get to clean up all the yard

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:30.210 
this is I get to clean up all the yard
waste<00:02:27.390> laying<00:02:28.390> around<00:02:28.510> the<00:02:28.780> yard<00:02:29.070> from<00:02:30.070> all

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:30.220 
waste laying around the yard from all

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:35.460 
waste laying around the yard from all
the<00:02:30.340> trees<00:02:32.940> so<00:02:33.940> we'll<00:02:34.630> let<00:02:34.780> that<00:02:34.810> burn<00:02:35.170> down

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:35.470 
the trees so we'll let that burn down

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:38.759 
the trees so we'll let that burn down
throw<00:02:35.950> a<00:02:35.980> few<00:02:36.220> more<00:02:36.280> pieces<00:02:36.640> on<00:02:36.970> there<00:02:37.269> and<00:02:37.769> let

00:02:38.759 --> 00:02:38.769 
throw a few more pieces on there and let

00:02:38.769 --> 00:02:45.780 
throw a few more pieces on there and let
it<00:02:38.800> cool<00:02:40.080> see<00:02:41.080> how<00:02:41.230> it<00:02:41.320> turns<00:02:41.590> out<00:02:44.640> so<00:02:45.640> it's

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:45.790 
it cool see how it turns out so it's

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:47.660 
it cool see how it turns out so it's
been<00:02:45.910> a<00:02:45.940> couple<00:02:46.150> days<00:02:46.300> since<00:02:46.450> I<00:02:46.840> had<00:02:46.870> to<00:02:47.050> fire
