00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:09.179
 one my subscriber advised me 

00:00:04.819 --> 00:00:13.670
 to plant tomatoes in the greenhouse 

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:18.050
 but plant their buckets as the ground 

00:00:13.670 --> 00:00:23.519
 buckets warms up faster and tomatoes 

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:26.460
 more efficiently grow buckets drilled 

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:29.160
 hole that is somewhere millimeters on 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:33.600
 20 five pieces and bye 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:39.960
 for the experiment I landed only three 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:42.500
 bush here these tomatoes grow with all 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:49.050
 tomatoes together 

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:54.739
 they planted a greenhouse 3 weeks ago well 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:01:00.449
 if we compare their height by 

00:00:54.739 --> 00:01:02.420
 You can say that the buckets so that 

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:04.379
 greenhouses 

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:07.200
 1 just 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:13.979
 that is, even some instances in 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:20.540
 the height of the greenhouse stink these tomatoes 

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:24.930
 what's in the buckets but this video I will shoot 

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:28.439
 throughout all growth yet 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:33.170
 ripen tomatoes not to 

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:36.210
 Compare whether in our region 

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:38.650
 this method or 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:43.890
 not worth 

00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:47.780
 we all poster us a cake and so 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:52.800
 June is our beginning 

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:58.820
 three weeks as planted there will be further 

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:58.820
 after a couple of weeks, look again 

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:01.720
 Well 

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:07.140
 3 weeks have passed 

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:19.950
 tomatoes buckets already have green 

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:19.950
 tomatoes 

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:36.340
 but judging by the rest of the growth of tomatoes and 

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:45.810
 buckets can even say less than 

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:48.330
 just planted hips planted 

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:55.020
 only three bushes 

00:02:48.330 --> 00:03:01.030
 For the sake of experiment, here is one tomato 

00:02:55.020 --> 00:03:07.860
 here is the second can see that 

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:10.860
 struck up and 3 

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:10.860
 a tomato 

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:24.600
 Tomatoes primer are somewhat ahead and 

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:30.920
 growth and 

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:30.920
 by size of fruit 

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:43.700
 we wait some more time wait when 

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:49.550
 tomatoes ripen and we will compare 

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:49.550
 some more springs 

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:59.390
 in the greenhouse bo katya pepper and raised film 

00:03:56.340 --> 00:04:04.670
 and constantly 

00:03:59.390 --> 00:04:07.470
 do not close closes in spring 

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:12.150
 when tomatoes are planted at night when 

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:13.970
 it's cold already late autumn and now 

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:19.370
 tomato growth 

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:26.850
 already reached the bulk and 

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:31.880
 meter-twenty height here are the tomatoes from that 

00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:39.050
 same seedlings planted in open ground 

00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:42.050
 their height is only 90 centimeters 

00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:42.050
 height 

00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:58.139
 more than a month has passed since 

00:04:56.020 --> 00:05:03.280
 last shoot 

00:04:58.139 --> 00:05:08.980
 Well, you can already see the tomatoes in the open 

00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:16.810
 soil is starting to ripen but in growth 

00:05:08.980 --> 00:05:21.000
 they seem to be very late already started 

00:05:16.810 --> 00:05:23.169
 August well, as we see the growth of tomatoes 

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:29.850
 low open ground 

00:05:23.169 --> 00:05:33.150
 well, just starting to keep up 

00:05:29.850 --> 00:05:39.820
 tomatoes planted in the greenhouse 

00:05:33.150 --> 00:05:48.400
 already reached height to two meters already 

00:05:39.820 --> 00:05:53.010
 all ripen perfectly already started tearing 

00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:58.479
 their tomatoes that is 

00:05:53.010 --> 00:06:05.669
 plentifully grow watering and envy 

00:05:58.479 --> 00:06:05.669
 good and ripe tomatoes already missing 

00:06:06.770 --> 00:06:15.580
 Well, our experimental tomatoes 

00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:18.940
 hips in the growth of these same 

00:06:15.580 --> 00:06:23.870
 let ripen too 

00:06:18.940 --> 00:06:26.990
 only lower clusters on others already on 

00:06:23.870 --> 00:06:31.610
 some bushes in a greenhouse 

00:06:26.990 --> 00:06:37.849
 already starting to grow brown and the top well, 

00:06:31.610 --> 00:06:41.389
 hips only lower branches ripen well 

00:06:37.849 --> 00:06:45.919
 based on this experiment now i'm 

00:06:41.389 --> 00:06:51.020
 I can say that this method for our 

00:06:45.919 --> 00:06:54.979
 region is not particularly suitable because 

00:06:51.020 --> 00:07:00.280
 first thigh tomatoes a little 

00:06:54.979 --> 00:07:08.030
 growth retardation has not reached the roots 

00:07:00.280 --> 00:07:12.409
 to the ground well, ripen in the same way 

00:07:08.030 --> 00:07:16.789
 we can say but the effectiveness of the tomato in 

00:07:12.409 --> 00:07:22.120
 the greenhouse is much higher than in the open 

00:07:16.789 --> 00:07:25.310
 ground and from those that are planted buckets 

00:07:22.120 --> 00:07:31.639
 Anyone interested can experiment 

00:07:25.310 --> 00:07:36.169
 for myself I have already checked this method but I 

00:07:31.639 --> 00:07:41.889
 I will continue to plant further 

00:07:36.169 --> 00:07:46.210
 tomatoes in the greenhouse without buckets as well as 

00:07:41.889 --> 00:07:46.210
 we are always soot
