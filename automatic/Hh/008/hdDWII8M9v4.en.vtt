that success or failure affects them
personally<00:05:53.870> so<00:05:54.870> why<00:05:55.440> have<00:05:55.620> a<00:05:55.650> character<00:05:56.040> arc

00:05:56.320 --> 00:05:56.330

00:05:56.330 --> 00:05:59.630 
personally so why have a character arc
as<00:05:57.330> I<00:05:57.900> said<00:05:58.110> earlier<00:05:58.380> it<00:05:58.950> creates<00:05:59.520> an

00:05:59.630 --> 00:05:59.640 
as I said earlier it creates an

00:05:59.640 --> 00:06:01.610 
as I said earlier it creates an
interesting<00:05:59.940> character<00:06:00.630> if<00:06:00.870> your<00:06:01.110> hero<00:06:01.320> never

00:06:01.610 --> 00:06:01.620 
interesting character if your hero never

00:06:01.620 --> 00:06:04.790 
interesting character if your hero never
changes<00:06:02.250> then<00:06:02.880> your<00:06:03.690> character<00:06:04.650> becomes

00:06:04.790 --> 00:06:04.800 
changes then your character becomes

00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:06.860 
changes then your character becomes
predictable<00:06:05.250> and<00:06:05.580> boring<00:06:05.970> and<00:06:06.180> you<00:06:06.750> know
