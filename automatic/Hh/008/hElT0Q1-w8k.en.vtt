00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949 
outstanding when he played last year and

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:06.859 
outstanding when he played last year and

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:19.979 
this division and you know I see him

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:21.469 
this division and you know I see him
every<00:01:20.159> single<00:01:20.310> day<00:01:20.490> in<00:01:20.639> training<00:01:20.880> is<00:01:21.090> a<00:01:21.119> proper

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479 
every single day in training is a proper

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:24.019 
every single day in training is a proper
honest<00:01:21.990> centre-half<00:01:22.679> that<00:01:22.979> can<00:01:23.159> that<00:01:23.729> can<00:01:23.789> do

you<00:01:24.869> know<00:01:24.959> defend<00:01:25.319> fantastically<00:01:26.039> and<00:01:26.219> I

00:01:26.419 --> 00:01:26.429 
you know defend fantastically and I

00:01:26.429 --> 00:01:29.059

00:01:29.059 --> 00:01:29.069 
think he's slightly under estimated at

00:01:29.069 --> 00:01:31.099

this<00:01:29.159> club<00:01:29.399> and<00:01:29.609> me<00:01:30.450> personally<00:01:30.749> I<00:01:31.079> think

00:01:31.099 --> 00:01:31.109 
this club and me personally I think

00:01:31.109 --> 00:01:32.629 
this club and me personally I think
he'll<00:01:31.469> it<00:01:31.709> will<00:01:31.799> do<00:01:31.919> exceptionally<00:01:32.429> well<00:01:32.429> for

00:01:32.629 --> 00:01:32.639
