the scorching aviators assassin which is

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:41.780 
the scorching aviators assassin which is
a<00:01:40.380> hat<00:01:40.619> for<00:01:40.770> the<00:01:40.860> spy<00:01:41.100> it's<00:01:41.430> pretty<00:01:41.640> much<00:01:41.729> like

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:41.790 
a hat for the spy it's pretty much like

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:43.370 
a hat for the spy it's pretty much like
a<00:01:41.939> pilot's<00:01:42.420> hat<00:01:42.570> though<00:01:43.049> it<00:01:43.200> is<00:01:43.320> very

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380 
a pilot's hat though it is very

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:45.380 
a pilot's hat though it is very
comparable<00:01:44.009> to<00:01:44.220> the<00:01:44.369> team<00:01:44.549> captain<00:01:45.030> if<00:01:45.270> I

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
comparable to the team captain if I

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:47.480 
comparable to the team captain if I
don't<00:01:45.600> say<00:01:45.840> so<00:01:45.899> myself<00:01:46.159> some<00:01:47.159> of<00:01:47.250> you<00:01:47.340> might

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:30.220 
the description to create that tells you

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:32.190 
the description to create that tells you
what<00:02:30.430> kind<00:02:30.790> of<00:02:30.909> genefex<00:02:31.420> you<00:02:31.689> can<00:02:31.840> get<00:02:31.989> from

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:32.200 
what kind of genefex you can get from

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:33.750 
what kind of genefex you can get from
those<00:02:32.409> crates<00:02:32.739> so<00:02:33.280> maybe<00:02:33.430> that's<00:02:33.670> just

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:33.760 
those crates so maybe that's just

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:35.369 
those crates so maybe that's just
encourage<00:02:34.209> more<00:02:34.390> people<00:02:34.750> to<00:02:34.870> use<00:02:34.959> crates

00:02:35.369 --> 00:02:35.379 
encourage more people to use crates

00:02:35.379 --> 00:02:38.429 
encourage more people to use crates
under<00:02:35.620> series<00:02:35.950> 25<00:02:36.430> but<00:02:37.180> even<00:02:37.840> so<00:02:37.959> I<00:02:37.989> just<00:02:38.230> think

00:02:38.429 --> 00:02:38.439 
under series 25 but even so I just think

00:02:38.439 --> 00:02:40.559 
under series 25 but even so I just think
these<00:02:38.590> first<00:02:38.890> in<00:02:39.099> effects<00:02:39.549> are<00:02:40.150> coming<00:02:40.480> into

00:02:40.559 --> 00:02:40.569 
these first in effects are coming into

00:02:40.569 --> 00:02:42.569 
these first in effects are coming into
the<00:02:40.720> game<00:02:40.900> far<00:02:41.319> more<00:02:41.680> frequently<00:02:42.189> than<00:02:42.400> they

00:02:42.569 --> 00:02:42.579 
the game far more frequently than they

00:02:42.579 --> 00:02:43.170 
the game far more frequently than they
once<00:02:42.849> did

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:43.180 
once did

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:45.390 
once did
so<00:02:43.450> let<00:02:44.349> me<00:02:44.379> guys<00:02:44.560> know<00:02:44.769> what<00:02:44.920> you<00:02:45.040> think<00:02:45.280> in

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:46.870 
the comments and yeah let's get to it

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:49.289 
the comments and yeah let's get to it
but<00:02:47.739> you<00:02:47.829> didn't<00:02:48.040> expect<00:02:48.370> that<00:02:48.519> a<00:02:48.730> burning

00:02:49.289 --> 00:02:49.299 
but you didn't expect that a burning

00:02:49.299 --> 00:02:51.270 
but you didn't expect that a burning
flames<00:02:49.629> aviators<00:02:50.349> assassin<00:02:50.889> got<00:02:51.069> brought

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:51.280 
flames aviators assassin got brought

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:53.580 
flames aviators assassin got brought
into<00:02:51.400> the<00:02:51.579> game<00:02:51.790> and<00:02:52.060> you<00:02:52.750> know<00:02:52.780> again<00:02:53.169> another

into the game and you know again another

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:55.170 
into the game and you know again another
first<00:02:53.980> in<00:02:54.129> effect<00:02:54.459> I<00:02:54.579> think<00:02:54.760> they<00:02:54.819> only<00:02:54.849> like

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:55.180 
first in effect I think they only like

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:57.119 
first in effect I think they only like
four<00:02:55.540> or<00:02:55.659> five<00:02:55.689> of<00:02:56.079> these<00:02:56.200> on<00:02:56.409> outposts<00:02:56.980> you

00:02:57.119 --> 00:02:57.129 
four or five of these on outposts you

00:02:57.129 --> 00:02:59.099 
four or five of these on outposts you
know<00:02:57.220> just<00:02:57.400> an<00:02:57.489> unusual<00:02:57.669> form<00:02:58.209> so<00:02:58.810> the<00:02:58.900> fact

00:02:59.099 --> 00:02:59.109 
know just an unusual form so the fact

00:02:59.109 --> 00:03:00.720 
know just an unusual form so the fact
that<00:02:59.200> there<00:02:59.319> are<00:02:59.409> burning<00:02:59.829> flames<00:03:00.159> version

think the only sword that the Scout

00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:54.810 
think the only sword that the Scout
actually<00:04:52.479> has<00:04:52.900> is<00:04:53.229> the<00:04:53.560> three-room<00:04:54.160> blade<00:04:54.430> so

00:04:54.810 --> 00:04:54.820 
actually has is the three-room blade so

00:04:54.820 --> 00:04:56.999 
actually has is the three-room blade so
and<00:04:55.120> you<00:04:56.080> know<00:04:56.199> with<00:04:56.380> that<00:04:56.530> taunt<00:04:56.860> they

00:05:51.659 --> 00:05:51.669 
on it it would change the hairstyle

00:05:51.669 --> 00:05:54.089
