00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190 
disappear all the time however they're

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:04.130 
disappear all the time however they're
random<00:01:02.519> reboots<00:01:02.699> they<00:01:03.149> do<00:01:03.210> disappear<00:01:03.870> and

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
random reboots they do disappear and

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:06.080 
random reboots they do disappear and
then<00:01:04.680> they<00:01:04.800> need<00:01:04.980> to<00:01:05.100> be<00:01:05.220> restored<00:01:05.610> and<00:01:06.000> you

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
then they need to be restored and you

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:07.910 
then they need to be restored and you
can<00:01:06.240> see<00:01:06.420> how<00:01:06.600> many<00:01:06.660> shortcuts<00:01:07.290> I<00:01:07.410> got<00:01:07.590> in<00:01:07.740> this

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
can see how many shortcuts I got in this

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:12.680 
can see how many shortcuts I got in this
and<00:01:08.750> so<00:01:09.750> you<00:01:10.410> obviously<00:01:10.920> would<00:01:11.850> take<00:01:12.390> a<00:01:12.420> lot<00:01:12.660> of

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:12.690 
and so you obviously would take a lot of

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:14.420 
and so you obviously would take a lot of
time<00:01:12.960> having<00:01:13.200> to<00:01:13.380> restore<00:01:13.770> that<00:01:13.950> if<00:01:14.190> you<00:01:14.280> did

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430 
time having to restore that if you did

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:18.320 
time having to restore that if you did
it<00:01:14.520> the<00:01:14.610> hard<00:01:14.760> way<00:01:14.850> so<00:01:16.550> what<00:01:17.550> I<00:01:17.580> do<00:01:17.700> this<00:01:18.120> I

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
it the hard way so what I do this I

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:21.860 
it the hard way so what I do this I
created<00:01:18.780> a<00:01:18.990> folder<00:01:19.460> inside<00:01:20.460> My<00:01:20.850> Documents<00:01:21.120> it

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:21.870

show you how to do that

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:26.930 
show you how to do that
I<00:02:23.880> first<00:02:24.880> have<00:02:25.600> to<00:02:25.630> erase<00:02:26.290> all<00:02:26.500> the<00:02:26.620> toolbars

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:26.940 
I first have to erase all the toolbars

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:32.310 
I first have to erase all the toolbars
to<00:02:27.940> simulate<00:02:28.360> a<00:02:29.010> reboot<00:02:30.690> when<00:02:31.690> I<00:02:31.750> when<00:02:32.290> a

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:32.320 
to simulate a reboot when I when a

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:34.050 
to simulate a reboot when I when a
reboot<00:02:32.680> comes<00:02:32.950> up<00:02:33.160> without<00:02:33.430> these<00:02:33.610> toolbars

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:34.060 
reboot comes up without these toolbars

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:39.930 
reboot comes up without these toolbars
in<00:02:34.209> place<00:02:34.480> right<00:02:35.470> so<00:02:35.709> let's<00:02:36.310> do<00:02:36.520> that<00:02:36.550> so<00:02:38.940> I'm

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:39.940 
in place right so let's do that so I'm

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:51.780 
in place right so let's do that so I'm
just<00:02:40.120> gonna<00:02:40.240> quickly

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:51.790 

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:58.330 

three<00:02:52.790> and<00:02:53.390> one<00:02:53.780> more

00:02:58.330 --> 00:02:58.340 

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:00.070 

and<00:02:59.340> there<00:02:59.580> we<00:02:59.700> are

00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:00.080 
and there we are

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:03.800 
and there we are
so<00:03:01.280> this<00:03:02.280> then<00:03:02.550> will<00:03:03.000> be<00:03:03.090> the<00:03:03.120> situation<00:03:03.720> you

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:03.810 
so this then will be the situation you

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:07.070 
so this then will be the situation you
find<00:03:03.990> yourself<00:03:04.110> in<00:03:04.530> that<00:03:05.510> before<00:03:06.510> you<00:03:06.660> when

00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:07.080 
find yourself in that before you when

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:08.510 
find yourself in that before you when
you<00:03:07.170> shut<00:03:07.350> down<00:03:07.470> your<00:03:07.530> computer<00:03:07.710> last<00:03:08.280> it

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:08.520 
you shut down your computer last it

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:10.580 
you shut down your computer last it

there's<00:03:29.010> no<00:03:29.190> fix<00:03:29.490> that<00:03:29.700> this<00:03:29.820> bug<00:03:30.120> it<00:03:30.300> will<00:03:30.510> you

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:30.810 
there's no fix that this bug it will you

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:33.050 
there's no fix that this bug it will you
can't<00:03:31.080> prevent<00:03:31.560> it<00:03:31.709> from<00:03:31.740> happening<00:03:32.040> but<00:03:32.550> you

can't<00:03:33.270> restore<00:03:33.570> them<00:03:33.750> quickly<00:03:33.990> so<00:03:34.739> if<00:03:34.830> you

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:34.920 
can't restore them quickly so if you

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:37.100
