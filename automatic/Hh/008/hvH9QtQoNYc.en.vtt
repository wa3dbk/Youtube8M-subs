to<00:01:17.700> get<00:01:17.820> a<00:01:17.850> title<00:01:18.270> that<00:01:18.540> is<00:01:18.869> trying<00:01:19.439> to<00:01:19.710> compete

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:20.189 
to get a title that is trying to compete

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:23.390 
to get a title that is trying to compete
with<00:01:20.299> men<00:01:21.299> I<00:01:21.689> think<00:01:22.259> it<00:01:22.380> will<00:01:22.650> try<00:01:22.950> to<00:01:23.009> compete

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400 
with men I think it will try to compete

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:26.240 
with men I think it will try to compete
in<00:01:23.549> that<00:01:23.670> space<00:01:24.030> will<00:01:24.960> it<00:01:25.110> be<00:01:25.259> successful<00:01:26.040> I

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
in that space will it be successful I

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:29.690 
in that space will it be successful I
really<00:01:26.909> don't<00:01:27.150> know<00:01:27.240> it<00:01:27.750> really<00:01:28.229> depends<00:01:28.979> on<00:01:29.100> a

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
really don't know it really depends on a

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:31.850 
really don't know it really depends on a
few<00:01:29.820> things<00:01:30.150> but<00:01:30.600> I<00:01:30.659> actually<00:01:31.020> think<00:01:31.590> that

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 
few things but I actually think that

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:35.270 
few things but I actually think that
this<00:01:32.670> game<00:01:33.000> if<00:01:33.990> they<00:01:34.229> really<00:01:34.530> have<00:01:34.829> the<00:01:35.040> pulse

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
this game if they really have the pulse

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:37.460 
this game if they really have the pulse
of<00:01:35.460> what's<00:01:35.640> going<00:01:35.820> on<00:01:36.000> has<00:01:36.509> a<00:01:36.540> legitimate<00:01:37.259> shot

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:37.470 
of what's going on has a legitimate shot

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:40.940 
of what's going on has a legitimate shot
to<00:01:38.040> challenge<00:01:38.460> matin<00:01:38.909> for<00:01:39.780> the<00:01:39.960> crown<00:01:40.290> out<00:01:40.680> of

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
to challenge matin for the crown out of

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:42.620 
to challenge matin for the crown out of
the<00:01:41.100> gate<00:01:41.310> I<00:01:41.549> do<00:01:41.640> think<00:01:42.210> it's<00:01:42.360> a<00:01:42.450> possibility

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:42.630 
the gate I do think it's a possibility

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:46.010 
the gate I do think it's a possibility
it<00:01:43.290> sounds<00:01:44.250> far-fetched<00:01:44.460> that<00:01:45.060> a<00:01:45.119> rookie<00:01:45.810> can

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
it sounds far-fetched that a rookie can

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:48.080 
it sounds far-fetched that a rookie can
challenge<00:01:46.229> event<00:01:46.680> like<00:01:46.860> this<00:01:47.040> but<00:01:47.820> we're

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090 
challenge event like this but we're

some pretty big mistakes I can I do I'm
not<00:02:11.430> unrealistic<00:02:12.030> when<00:02:12.630> it<00:02:12.720> comes<00:02:12.900> to<00:02:13.020> games

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:13.230 
not unrealistic when it comes to games

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:14.990 
not unrealistic when it comes to games
if<00:02:13.410> you<00:02:13.530> check<00:02:13.860> check<00:02:14.250> my<00:02:14.400> record<00:02:14.790> over<00:02:14.970> the

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:15.000 
if you check check my record over the

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.390 
if you check check my record over the
last<00:02:15.150> few<00:02:15.510> years<00:02:15.570> I'm<00:02:16.260> not<00:02:16.440> unrealistic<00:02:17.040> with

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:17.400 
last few years I'm not unrealistic with

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:19.700 
last few years I'm not unrealistic with
madden<00:02:18.180> expectations<00:02:18.960> and<00:02:19.110> I<00:02:19.470> definitely

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:19.710 
madden expectations and I definitely

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:21.650 
madden expectations and I definitely
won't<00:02:19.980> be<00:02:20.100> unrealistic<00:02:20.550> with<00:02:20.850> this<00:02:21.030> I<00:02:21.210> expect

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:21.660 
won't be unrealistic with this I expect

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:23.870 
won't be unrealistic with this I expect
there<00:02:21.930> to<00:02:21.960> be<00:02:22.110> some<00:02:22.350> things<00:02:22.560> in<00:02:22.890> there<00:02:23.490> that<00:02:23.550> we

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:23.880 
there to be some things in there that we

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:26.660 
there to be some things in there that we
don't<00:02:23.910> like<00:02:24.270> now<00:02:24.980> if<00:02:25.980> we<00:02:26.190> can<00:02:26.310> compete<00:02:26.610> with

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:26.670 
don't like now if we can compete with

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:29.030 
don't like now if we can compete with
man<00:02:26.940> look<00:02:27.300> if<00:02:27.480> the<00:02:27.630> game<00:02:27.810> has<00:02:28.020> an<00:02:28.170> NFL<00:02:28.530> license

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:29.040 
man look if the game has an NFL license

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:30.560 
man look if the game has an NFL license
it's<00:02:29.459> gonna<00:02:29.730> compete<00:02:30.000> with<00:02:30.150> that<00:02:30.180> and<00:02:30.480> I<00:02:30.540> think

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:30.570 
it's gonna compete with that and I think

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:33.560 
it's gonna compete with that and I think
I<00:02:31.020> think<00:02:31.740> that<00:02:31.950> you<00:02:32.160> can<00:02:32.370> just<00:02:32.400> count<00:02:33.150> that

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:33.570 
I think that you can just count that

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:34.910 
I think that you can just count that
this<00:02:34.020> game<00:02:34.200> could<00:02:34.350> end<00:02:34.500> up<00:02:34.620> better<00:02:34.830> than

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:34.920 
this game could end up better than

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:37.550 
this game could end up better than
madden<00:02:35.370> in<00:02:35.760> a<00:02:35.850> lot<00:02:35.970> of<00:02:36.090> people's<00:02:36.330> eyes<00:02:36.480> if<00:02:36.780> it

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:37.560 
madden in a lot of people's eyes if it

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:39.530 
madden in a lot of people's eyes if it
doesn't<00:02:38.040> have<00:02:38.220> the<00:02:38.370> license<00:02:38.820> it's<00:02:39.240> gonna<00:02:39.420> be

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:39.540 
doesn't have the license it's gonna be

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:41.660 
doesn't have the license it's gonna be
an<00:02:39.630> uphill<00:02:39.780> battle<00:02:39.959> but<00:02:40.709> if<00:02:40.860> it's<00:02:41.040> if<00:02:41.310> it's<00:02:41.520> a

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:41.670 
an uphill battle but if it's if it's a

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:47.960 
an uphill battle but if it's if it's a
good<00:02:42.140> foundation<00:02:43.140> a<00:02:44.010> good<00:02:44.340> sound<00:02:45.239> game<00:02:46.940> then<00:02:47.940> I

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:47.970 
good foundation a good sound game then I

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:49.520 
good foundation a good sound game then I
think<00:02:48.450> I<00:02:48.600> don't<00:02:48.750> know<00:02:48.840> if<00:02:48.930> he<00:02:48.989> could<00:02:49.080> compete

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:49.530 
think I don't know if he could compete

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:51.740 
think I don't know if he could compete

I'm not just talking about the

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:54.890 
I'm not just talking about the
simulation<00:02:53.700> community<00:02:54.120> I'm<00:02:54.510> talking<00:02:54.840> about

simulation community I'm talking about

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:56.780 
simulation community I'm talking about
everybody<00:02:55.560> who<00:02:55.709> can<00:02:55.830> make<00:02:55.980> videos<00:02:56.190> and

game<00:03:06.360> to<00:03:06.840> compete<00:03:07.020> with<00:03:07.320> Matt<00:03:07.440> and<00:03:07.470> I<00:03:07.650> do<00:03:07.709> think

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:08.040 
game to compete with Matt and I do think

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:09.710 
game to compete with Matt and I do think
it's<00:03:08.160> a<00:03:08.190> possibility<00:03:08.340> but<00:03:08.820> the<00:03:09.030> game<00:03:09.270> is<00:03:09.510> gonna

00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:09.720 
it's a possibility but the game is gonna

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:13.550 
it's a possibility but the game is gonna
have<00:03:09.840> to<00:03:09.870> be<00:03:09.959> sound<00:03:10.380> now<00:03:11.220> is<00:03:11.810> what<00:03:12.810> are<00:03:13.080> you

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:21.660 
light game that's tuned up a lot of the

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:22.910 
light game that's tuned up a lot of the
things<00:03:21.870> we<00:03:21.989> saw<00:03:22.140> him<00:03:22.260> back<00:03:22.410> breaker<00:03:22.620> that<00:03:22.830> we

things we saw him back breaker that we
didn't<00:03:23.160> like<00:03:23.400> I<00:03:23.640> expect<00:03:24.420> it<00:03:24.600> to<00:03:24.750> be<00:03:24.900> tuned<00:03:25.170> up

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:25.380 
didn't like I expect it to be tuned up

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:27.949 
didn't like I expect it to be tuned up
next<00:03:26.340> gen<00:03:26.549> looking<00:03:26.880> i<00:03:26.970> expect<00:03:27.330> the<00:03:27.420> animations

00:03:27.949 --> 00:03:27.959 
next gen looking i expect the animations

00:03:27.959 --> 00:03:30.800 
next gen looking i expect the animations
to<00:03:28.080> be<00:03:28.170> amazing<00:03:28.680> I<00:03:28.860> expect<00:03:29.760> real-time<00:03:30.180> physics

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:30.810 
to be amazing I expect real-time physics

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:32.870 
to be amazing I expect real-time physics
I<00:03:31.019> expect<00:03:31.769> the<00:03:31.860> animations<00:03:32.370> to<00:03:32.519> be<00:03:32.610> a<00:03:32.640> little

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:32.880 
I expect the animations to be a little

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:34.310 
I expect the animations to be a little
bit<00:03:33.000> more<00:03:33.150> fluid<00:03:33.600> than<00:03:33.630> that<00:03:33.930> and<00:03:34.110> sometimes

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:34.320 
bit more fluid than that and sometimes

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:35.930 
bit more fluid than that and sometimes
met<00:03:34.709> and<00:03:34.890> it<00:03:34.980> seems<00:03:35.190> like<00:03:35.370> the<00:03:35.519> animations

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:35.940 
met and it seems like the animations

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:39.319 
met and it seems like the animations
aren't<00:03:36.120> compressed<00:03:36.510> I<00:03:37.500> what<00:03:38.489> I'm<00:03:38.700> expected<00:03:39.239> on

00:03:39.319 --> 00:03:39.329 
aren't compressed I what I'm expected on

00:03:39.329 --> 00:03:41.390 
aren't compressed I what I'm expected on
this<00:03:39.480> game<00:03:39.690> and<00:03:39.900> the<00:03:39.989> animations<00:03:40.530> to<00:03:41.070> be<00:03:41.190> quite

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:41.400 
this game and the animations to be quite

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:43.430 
this game and the animations to be quite
a<00:03:41.430> bit<00:03:41.670> more<00:03:41.850> fluid<00:03:42.360> now<00:03:42.840> it's<00:03:43.200> gonna<00:03:43.350> have

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:43.440 
a bit more fluid now it's gonna have

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:46.340 
a bit more fluid now it's gonna have
some<00:03:43.620> bugs<00:03:43.860> I<00:03:44.190> know<00:03:44.640> modes<00:03:45.390> will<00:03:45.750> probably<00:03:46.170> be

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:46.350 
some bugs I know modes will probably be

00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:48.740 
some bugs I know modes will probably be

00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:48.750 
limited I don't you know it's probably

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:50.780 
limited I don't you know it's probably
not<00:03:49.019> gonna<00:03:49.170> have<00:03:49.380> the<00:03:49.590> ultimate<00:03:49.769> team<00:03:50.370> and<00:03:50.730> the
