00:03:02.979 --> 00:03:02.989 
punishment for something so small and my

00:03:02.989 --> 00:03:06.879 
punishment for something so small and my
guess<00:03:03.989> now<00:03:04.349> I'm<00:03:04.500> just<00:03:04.709> guessing<00:03:04.919> here<00:03:05.129> is<00:03:05.489> that

00:03:06.879 --> 00:03:06.889 
guess now I'm just guessing here is that

00:03:06.889 --> 00:03:10.009 
guess now I'm just guessing here is that
if<00:03:07.889> they<00:03:08.189> they<00:03:08.639> probably<00:03:08.909> didn't<00:03:09.239> like<00:03:09.389> you

00:03:10.009 --> 00:03:10.019 
if they they probably didn't like you

00:03:10.019 --> 00:03:13.339 
if they they probably didn't like you
know<00:03:10.139> he<00:03:10.620> probably<00:03:10.889> rubbed<00:03:11.340> the<00:03:11.989> warden<00:03:12.989> or

00:03:13.339 --> 00:03:13.349 
know he probably rubbed the warden or

00:03:13.349 --> 00:03:15.500 
know he probably rubbed the warden or
the<00:03:13.500> guards<00:03:14.010> or<00:03:14.189> whoever<00:03:14.400> is<00:03:14.669> supervising<00:03:15.419> him

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:15.510 
the guards or whoever is supervising him

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:17.360 
the guards or whoever is supervising him
the<00:03:15.659> wrong<00:03:15.840> way<00:03:16.139> because<00:03:16.829> that's<00:03:17.069> such<00:03:17.340> a

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:17.370 
the wrong way because that's such a

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:18.949 
the wrong way because that's such a
thing<00:03:17.730> that<00:03:17.849> they<00:03:17.939> could<00:03:18.120> just<00:03:18.329> say<00:03:18.510> hey<00:03:18.689> I'm

00:03:18.949 --> 00:03:18.959
