we<00:00:03.720> talked<00:00:03.929> about<00:00:04.080> half<00:00:04.830> steps<00:00:05.130> and<00:00:05.279> whole

00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:05.370

steps<00:00:05.549> and<00:00:05.940> we<00:00:06.089> said<00:00:06.330> that<00:00:06.540> a<00:00:06.779> half<00:00:07.470> step<00:00:07.710> is

00:00:08.259 --> 00:00:08.269 
steps and we said that a half step is

00:00:08.269 --> 00:00:11.560 
steps and we said that a half step is
one<00:00:09.269> note<00:00:09.540> higher<00:00:09.809> or<00:00:10.080> lower<00:00:10.110> in<00:00:10.590> distance<00:00:11.070> as

00:01:58.300 --> 00:01:58.310 
sounded like doremi fossil aunty don't

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:00.740 
sounded like doremi fossil aunty don't
but<00:01:59.310> C<00:01:59.549> is<00:01:59.700> special<00:02:00.149> because<00:02:00.240> it's<00:02:00.570> the<00:02:00.719> only

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:00.750 
but C is special because it's the only

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:02.990 
but C is special because it's the only
one<00:02:01.290> that<00:02:01.320> doesn't<00:02:01.649> need<00:02:01.860> any<00:02:02.159> black<00:02:02.520> keys<00:02:02.790> to

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:03.000 
one that doesn't need any black keys to

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:04.370 
one that doesn't need any black keys to
make<00:02:03.119> it<00:02:03.240> say<00:02:03.390> during<00:02:03.570> the<00:02:03.750> fall<00:02:03.960> so<00:02:04.079> let<00:02:04.259> you

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:04.380 
make it say during the fall so let you

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:06.920 
make it say during the fall so let you
know<00:02:04.640> so<00:02:05.640> let's<00:02:05.880> use<00:02:06.149> half<00:02:06.450> steps<00:02:06.719> and<00:02:06.840> whole

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:06.930 
know so let's use half steps and whole

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:08.690 
know so let's use half steps and whole
steps<00:02:07.079> and<00:02:07.439> figure<00:02:07.740> out<00:02:07.770> the<00:02:08.039> distances

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:08.700 
steps and figure out the distances

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:11.740 
steps and figure out the distances
between<00:02:08.729> the<00:02:09.270> notes<00:02:09.690> in<00:02:09.989> the<00:02:10.679> C<00:02:10.860> major<00:02:11.039> scale

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:11.750 
between the notes in the C major scale

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:14.930 
between the notes in the C major scale
so<00:02:12.750> how<00:02:12.960> far<00:02:13.230> is<00:02:13.290> it<00:02:13.470> from<00:02:13.590> C<00:02:13.950> to<00:02:13.980> D<00:02:14.100> is<00:02:14.310> our

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:14.940 
so how far is it from C to D is our

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:16.760 
so how far is it from C to D is our
first<00:02:15.180> question<00:02:15.480> but<00:02:15.930> before<00:02:16.260> we<00:02:16.380> answer<00:02:16.590> that

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:16.770 
first question but before we answer that

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:21.199 
first question but before we answer that
I<00:02:16.920> want<00:02:17.220> to<00:02:17.280> talk<00:02:17.459> about<00:02:17.490> this<00:02:17.730> note<00:02:18.120> C<00:02:20.209> it's

00:02:21.199 --> 00:02:21.209

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:04.250 
E and F so there is a black key between

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:08.720 
E and F so there is a black key between
C&amp;D<00:03:05.250> so<00:03:06.180> C<00:03:06.570> goes<00:03:06.810> up<00:03:06.989> to<00:03:07.140> C<00:03:07.320> sharp<00:03:07.650> one<00:03:08.070> note<00:03:08.310> up

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:08.730

in<00:05:58.130> the<00:05:58.220> D<00:05:58.370> major<00:05:58.550> scale<00:05:58.730> and<00:05:59.210> maybe<00:05:59.600> you<00:05:59.750> would

00:05:59.890 --> 00:05:59.900 
in the D major scale and maybe you would

00:05:59.900 --> 00:06:01.990 
in the D major scale and maybe you would
know<00:06:00.080> but<00:06:00.830> maybe<00:06:01.040> you<00:06:01.160> wouldn't<00:06:01.430> and<00:06:01.730> I<00:06:01.820> would

00:06:01.990 --> 00:06:02.000 
know but maybe you wouldn't and I would

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:04.300 
know but maybe you wouldn't and I would
say<00:06:02.210> well<00:06:03.050> if<00:06:03.290> you<00:06:03.410> can't<00:06:03.620> remember<00:06:03.770> a<00:06:04.040> major

00:06:04.300 --> 00:06:04.310 
say well if you can't remember a major

00:06:04.310 --> 00:06:06.909 
say well if you can't remember a major
scale<00:06:04.700> how<00:06:05.450> could<00:06:05.780> you<00:06:05.810> remember<00:06:06.230> I<00:06:06.380> mean<00:06:06.650> you

00:06:06.909 --> 00:06:06.919 
scale how could you remember I mean you

00:06:06.919 --> 00:06:08.920 
scale how could you remember I mean you
hopefully<00:06:07.430> would<00:06:07.640> answer<00:06:07.850> one<00:06:08.450> whole<00:06:08.780> step

00:06:08.920 --> 00:06:08.930 
hopefully would answer one whole step

00:06:08.930 --> 00:06:10.690 
hopefully would answer one whole step
whole<00:06:09.169> step<00:06:09.230> half<00:06:09.590> step<00:06:09.650> whole<00:06:09.890> whole<00:06:10.430> whole

00:06:10.690 --> 00:06:10.700 
whole step half step whole whole whole

00:06:10.700 --> 00:06:13.450 
whole step half step whole whole whole
half<00:06:11.000> and<00:06:11.240> i<00:06:11.300> would<00:06:11.419> say<00:06:11.540> okay<00:06:12.230> well<00:06:12.500> let's

00:06:13.450 --> 00:06:13.460 
half and i would say okay well let's

00:06:13.460 --> 00:06:15.730 
half and i would say okay well let's
find<00:06:13.850> the<00:06:14.000> D<00:06:14.150> major<00:06:14.330> scale<00:06:14.480> put<00:06:14.960> D<00:06:15.380> into<00:06:15.650> the

00:06:15.730 --> 00:06:15.740 
find the D major scale put D into the

00:06:15.740 --> 00:06:18.580 
find the D major scale put D into the
one<00:06:15.950> place<00:06:16.220> now<00:06:16.490> go<00:06:16.640> up<00:06:16.730> a<00:06:16.850> whole<00:06:17.030> step<00:06:17.060> e<00:06:17.510> up<00:06:18.140> a

00:06:18.580 --> 00:06:18.590 
one place now go up a whole step e up a

00:06:18.590 --> 00:06:21.970 
one place now go up a whole step e up a
whole<00:06:18.770> step<00:06:18.800> f<00:06:19.220> sharp<00:06:19.280> up<00:06:19.790> a<00:06:20.090> half<00:06:20.270> step<00:06:20.300> g<00:06:20.990> etc

00:06:21.970 --> 00:06:21.980 
whole step f sharp up a half step g etc

00:06:21.980 --> 00:06:24.310 
whole step f sharp up a half step g etc
and<00:06:22.570> that's<00:06:23.570> that's<00:06:23.840> one<00:06:24.050> of<00:06:24.169> the<00:06:24.230> advantages

00:06:24.310 --> 00:06:24.320 
and that's that's one of the advantages

00:06:24.320 --> 00:06:29.230 
and that's that's one of the advantages
of<00:06:24.950> working<00:06:25.700> with<00:06:26.380> teachers<00:06:27.380> they<00:06:27.830> can<00:06:28.240> you

00:06:29.230 --> 00:06:29.240 
of working with teachers they can you

00:06:29.240 --> 00:06:30.659 
of working with teachers they can you
know

00:06:30.659 --> 00:06:30.669 
know

00:06:30.669 --> 00:06:33.250 
know
consistently<00:06:31.669> reinforce<00:06:32.360> these<00:06:32.600> ideas<00:06:33.050> with

00:06:33.250 --> 00:06:33.260 
consistently reinforce these ideas with

00:06:33.260 --> 00:06:39.310 
consistently reinforce these ideas with
you<00:06:33.440> okay<00:06:34.370> so<00:06:35.169> in<00:06:36.169> any<00:06:36.290> case<00:06:36.410> I<00:06:38.050> will<00:06:39.050> see<00:06:39.290> you

00:06:39.310 --> 00:06:39.320 
you okay so in any case I will see you

00:06:39.320 --> 00:06:40.600 
you okay so in any case I will see you
next<00:06:39.530> time<00:06:39.770> we're<00:06:39.979> going<00:06:40.100> to<00:06:40.160> start<00:06:40.370> figuring

00:06:40.600 --> 00:06:40.610 
next time we're going to start figuring

00:06:40.610 --> 00:06:50.980 
next time we're going to start figuring
out<00:06:40.910> some<00:06:41.090> major<00:06:41.270> scales

00:06:50.980 --> 00:06:50.990 

00:06:50.990 --> 00:06:53.050
