00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:04.670 
here we got a tee flip-flop here um and

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:06.980 
here we got a tee flip-flop here um and
if<00:01:05.670> you<00:01:05.850> don't<00:01:06.119> know<00:01:06.240> what<00:01:06.360> a<00:01:06.390> tee<00:01:06.540> flip-flop

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
if you don't know what a tee flip-flop

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:11.469 
if you don't know what a tee flip-flop
is<00:01:07.140> you<00:01:07.470> should<00:01:07.740> go<00:01:08.340> to<00:01:08.400> watch<00:01:08.760> part<00:01:09.180> 3<00:01:09.360> of<00:01:09.810> my

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540 
redstone guide / tutorial anyway so i

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:17.960 
redstone guide / tutorial anyway so i
just<00:01:15.900> wanted<00:01:16.350> to<00:01:16.500> show<00:01:17.009> off<00:01:17.040> another<00:01:17.369> use<00:01:17.670> for

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970 
just wanted to show off another use for

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:23.539 
just wanted to show off another use for
a<00:01:18.810> toggle<00:01:20.180> flip-flop<00:01:21.180> and<00:01:21.720> look<00:01:22.409> he<00:01:23.130> opens<00:01:23.460> a

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:23.549 
a toggle flip-flop and look he opens a

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:29.240 
a toggle flip-flop and look he opens a
pin<00:01:23.729> bar<00:01:25.970> like<00:01:26.970> i<00:01:27.060> said<00:01:27.119> in<00:01:27.330> my<00:01:27.360> previous<00:01:28.250> video

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
pin bar like i said in my previous video

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:32.350 
pin bar like i said in my previous video
you<00:01:29.790> know<00:01:30.000> these<00:01:30.360> are<00:01:30.420> more<00:01:30.659> preferable<00:01:31.259> for

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:32.360 
you know these are more preferable for

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:34.819 
you know these are more preferable for
toggle<00:01:33.360> doors<00:01:33.600> in<00:01:33.840> general<00:01:34.200> just<00:01:34.229> doors<00:01:34.650> in

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:34.829 
toggle doors in general just doors in

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:39.679 
toggle doors in general just doors in
general<00:01:35.130> ya<00:01:36.229> know<00:01:37.229> this<00:01:37.710> is<00:01:37.920> the<00:01:38.659> switch<00:01:39.659> that

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:39.689 
general ya know this is the switch that

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:43.539 
general ya know this is the switch that
closes<00:01:40.229> it<00:01:41.390> because<00:01:42.390> you<00:01:42.479> can<00:01:42.600> wear<00:01:42.630> a<00:01:42.780> lot<00:01:43.200> of

00:01:43.539 --> 00:01:43.549 
closes it because you can wear a lot of

00:01:43.549 --> 00:01:48.649 
closes it because you can wear a lot of
inputs<00:01:44.549> into<00:01:45.079> this<00:01:46.079> well<00:01:46.619> over<00:01:47.100> there<00:01:47.509> if<00:01:48.509> you

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:29.720 
guys how to use in these past videos
anyway<00:02:27.680> so<00:02:28.680> you<00:02:28.770> actually<00:02:28.920> got<00:02:29.190> to<00:02:29.340> set<00:02:29.520> it<00:02:29.610> up

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:29.730 
anyway so you actually got to set it up

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:31.850 
anyway so you actually got to set it up
so<00:02:29.880> you<00:02:29.910> get<00:02:30.000> it<00:02:30.150> give<00:02:30.270> me<00:02:30.390> a<00:02:30.450> second<00:02:30.840> okay<00:02:31.620> guys

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:31.860 
so you get it give me a second okay guys

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:38.420 
so you get it give me a second okay guys
so<00:02:32.480> we're<00:02:33.480> back<00:02:33.870> and<00:02:34.140> I<00:02:36.140> just<00:02:37.140> some<00:02:37.530> added<00:02:38.250> some

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:38.430 
so we're back and I just some added some

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:42.080 
so we're back and I just some added some
logic<00:02:38.820> gates<00:02:39.000> to<00:02:39.180> this<00:02:39.330> so<00:02:40.250> right<00:02:41.250> now<00:02:41.280> see<00:02:41.760> we

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:42.090 
logic gates to this so right now see we

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:46.910 
logic gates to this so right now see we
got<00:02:42.270> our<00:02:42.420> button<00:02:42.750> here<00:02:43.230> that<00:02:43.940> does<00:02:44.940> not<00:02:45.920> toggle

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:46.920 
got our button here that does not toggle

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:51.380 
got our button here that does not toggle
well<00:02:47.190> it<00:02:48.060> doesn't<00:02:48.390> toggle<00:02:48.870> the<00:02:50.180> inside<00:02:51.180> of<00:02:51.210> the

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:51.390 
well it doesn't toggle the inside of the

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:53.900 
well it doesn't toggle the inside of the
hidden<00:02:51.900> door<00:02:51.930> anymore<00:02:52.260> and<00:02:52.730> that's<00:02:53.730> because

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:53.910 
hidden door anymore and that's because

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:56.240 
hidden door anymore and that's because
you<00:02:54.210> know<00:02:54.330> if<00:02:54.510> you've<00:02:54.660> seen<00:02:54.690> in<00:02:54.990> my<00:02:55.080> last<00:02:55.320> my

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:56.250 
you know if you've seen in my last my

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:57.860 
you know if you've seen in my last my
second<00:02:56.700> part<00:02:56.850> of<00:02:56.880> my<00:02:57.000> tutorial<00:02:57.420> I<00:02:57.480> taught<00:02:57.720> you

00:02:57.860 --> 00:02:57.870 
second part of my tutorial I taught you

00:02:57.870 --> 00:02:59.330 
second part of my tutorial I taught you
how<00:02:57.960> to<00:02:58.020> make<00:02:58.200> an<00:02:58.380> end<00:02:58.620> gate<00:02:58.860> which<00:02:59.040> is<00:02:59.190> this

00:02:59.330 --> 00:02:59.340 
how to make an end gate which is this

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:04.010 
how to make an end gate which is this
right<00:02:59.520> here<00:02:59.550> and<00:03:01.850> yeah<00:03:02.850> so<00:03:03.150> this<00:03:03.720> if<00:03:03.900> you<00:03:03.990> don't

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:04.020 
right here and yeah so this if you don't

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:05.630 
right here and yeah so this if you don't
know<00:03:04.290> you<00:03:04.350> can<00:03:04.650> go<00:03:04.890> back<00:03:05.070> there<00:03:05.310> real<00:03:05.460> quick

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:05.640 
know you can go back there real quick

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:08.540 
know you can go back there real quick
but<00:03:06.570> just<00:03:06.810> side<00:03:07.200> I'll<00:03:07.650> just<00:03:07.830> repeat<00:03:08.040> it<00:03:08.160> anyway

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:08.550 
but just side I'll just repeat it anyway

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:11.630 
but just side I'll just repeat it anyway
I'll<00:03:09.270> just<00:03:09.420> tell<00:03:09.840> you<00:03:10.040> both<00:03:11.040> of<00:03:11.100> these<00:03:11.310> torches

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:11.640 
I'll just tell you both of these torches

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:15.490 
I'll just tell you both of these torches
need<00:03:11.940> to<00:03:12.000> be<00:03:12.090> off<00:03:12.330> for<00:03:13.050> this<00:03:13.560> output<00:03:14.070> to<00:03:14.220> be<00:03:14.340> on

00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:15.500 
need to be off for this output to be on

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:19.220 
need to be off for this output to be on
that's<00:03:16.500> pretty<00:03:16.739> much<00:03:16.890> yeah<00:03:17.870> so<00:03:18.870> you<00:03:18.930> got<00:03:19.200> the

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:19.230 
that's pretty much yeah so you got the

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:21.920 
that's pretty much yeah so you got the
enabler<00:03:20.010> here<00:03:20.250> see<00:03:20.700> you<00:03:21.000> won't<00:03:21.209> it<00:03:21.780> won't

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:21.930 
enabler here see you won't it won't

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:23.510 
enabler here see you won't it won't
toggle<00:03:22.410> unless<00:03:22.680> this<00:03:22.800> enable<00:03:23.220> the<00:03:23.310> zone

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:23.520 
toggle unless this enable the zone

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:25.820 
toggle unless this enable the zone
because<00:03:23.820> they're<00:03:23.970> both<00:03:24.120> metals<00:03:24.590> so<00:03:25.590> have<00:03:25.709> to

00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:25.830 
because they're both metals so have to

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:29.479 
because they're both metals so have to
turn<00:03:26.040> this<00:03:26.190> off<00:03:26.370> and<00:03:27.350> push<00:03:28.350> the<00:03:28.470> button<00:03:28.739> doors

00:03:29.479 --> 00:03:29.489 
turn this off and push the button doors

00:03:29.489 --> 00:03:34.850 
turn this off and push the button doors
old<00:03:29.730> doors<00:03:30.180> open<00:03:33.020> then<00:03:34.020> we<00:03:34.230> got<00:03:34.380> you<00:03:34.500> know<00:03:34.620> this

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:34.860 
old doors open then we got you know this

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:36.470 
old doors open then we got you know this
setup<00:03:35.310> over<00:03:35.610> here<00:03:35.640> is<00:03:35.880> pretty<00:03:36.030> much<00:03:36.180> the<00:03:36.239> same

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:36.480 
setup over here is pretty much the same

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:39.229 
setup over here is pretty much the same
at<00:03:36.630> it<00:03:36.750> as<00:03:36.870> it<00:03:37.080> was<00:03:37.200> before<00:03:37.380> and<00:03:37.920> this<00:03:38.910> button

00:03:39.229 --> 00:03:39.239 
at it as it was before and this button

00:03:39.239 --> 00:03:44.020 
at it as it was before and this button
just<00:03:39.420> does<00:03:39.810> the<00:03:39.930> same<00:03:40.140> thing<00:03:41.720> closes<00:03:42.720> it<00:03:42.900> and

00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:44.030 
just does the same thing closes it and

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:48.320 
just does the same thing closes it and
pretty<00:03:45.030> much<00:03:45.120> what<00:03:45.450> we<00:03:45.480> did<00:03:45.720> here<00:03:46.160> as<00:03:47.160> we<00:03:48.120> added

00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:48.330 
pretty much what we did here as we added

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:52.070 
pretty much what we did here as we added
an<00:03:48.420> inverter<00:03:49.640> into<00:03:50.640> this<00:03:50.790> latch<00:03:51.360> right<00:03:51.750> here

00:03:52.070 --> 00:03:52.080 
an inverter into this latch right here

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:53.449 
an inverter into this latch right here
if<00:03:52.470> you<00:03:52.530> don't<00:03:52.620> know<00:03:52.739> what<00:03:52.860> it<00:03:52.950> really<00:03:53.100> is<00:03:53.220> just

00:03:53.449 --> 00:03:53.459 
if you don't know what it really is just

00:03:53.459 --> 00:03:55.970 
if you don't know what it really is just
refer<00:03:53.760> to<00:03:53.850> my<00:03:53.970> first<00:03:54.209> part<00:03:54.600> the<00:03:55.470> latter<00:03:55.680> is<00:03:55.830> in

00:03:55.970 --> 00:03:55.980 
refer to my first part the latter is in

00:03:55.980 --> 00:03:59.330 
refer to my first part the latter is in
my<00:03:56.130> third<00:03:56.610> part<00:03:56.940> um<00:03:57.180> but<00:03:57.870> yeah<00:03:58.080> so<00:03:58.860> we<00:03:59.100> over

00:03:59.330 --> 00:03:59.340 
my third part um but yeah so we over

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:02.900 
my third part um but yeah so we over
here<00:03:59.459> we<00:03:59.610> got<00:03:59.760> a<00:03:59.820> latch<00:04:00.510> right<00:04:00.720> here<00:04:00.930> so<00:04:01.200> uh<00:04:01.910> and

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:02.910 
here we got a latch right here so uh and

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:04.220 
here we got a latch right here so uh and
what<00:04:03.060> happens<00:04:03.360> in<00:04:03.480> this<00:04:03.600> is<00:04:03.720> when<00:04:03.900> you<00:04:04.050> press

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:04.230 
what happens in this is when you press

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:05.930 
what happens in this is when you press
the<00:04:04.410> button<00:04:04.440> it<00:04:05.070> comes<00:04:05.280> all<00:04:05.519> the<00:04:05.550> way<00:04:05.670> over

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:05.940 
the button it comes all the way over

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:09.740 
the button it comes all the way over
here<00:04:05.970> and<00:04:07.310> university<00:04:08.310> signal

00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:09.750 
here and university signal

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:13.550 
here and university signal
or<00:04:09.870> alternative<00:04:10.500> torch<00:04:10.710> off<00:04:10.890> right<00:04:12.440> so<00:04:13.440> that

00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:13.560 
or alternative torch off right so that

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:15.440 
or alternative torch off right so that
there's<00:04:13.740> no<00:04:13.770> power<00:04:14.010> going<00:04:14.250> into<00:04:14.430> this<00:04:14.820> block

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:15.450 
there's no power going into this block

00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:19.069 
there's no power going into this block
or<00:04:16.200> there<00:04:16.440> still<00:04:16.650> is<00:04:16.799> but<00:04:16.850> pretty<00:04:17.850> much<00:04:18.079> it

00:04:19.069 --> 00:04:19.079 
or there still is but pretty much it

00:04:19.079 --> 00:04:21.860 
or there still is but pretty much it
remembered<00:04:19.760> the<00:04:20.760> input<00:04:21.060> that<00:04:21.209> it<00:04:21.299> got<00:04:21.450> and<00:04:21.720> now

00:04:21.860 --> 00:04:21.870 
remembered the input that it got and now

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:23.930 
remembered the input that it got and now
it's<00:04:22.079> staying<00:04:22.410> like<00:04:22.650> that<00:04:22.860> yet<00:04:23.220> is<00:04:23.370> no<00:04:23.490> reset

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:23.940 
it's staying like that yet is no reset

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:26.630 
it's staying like that yet is no reset
button<00:04:23.970> on<00:04:24.270> this<00:04:24.420> I<00:04:25.040> guess<00:04:26.040> you<00:04:26.160> can<00:04:26.310> add<00:04:26.490> one

00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:26.640 
button on this I guess you can add one

00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:31.570 
button on this I guess you can add one
if<00:04:26.730> you<00:04:26.820> like<00:04:26.880> um<00:04:27.450> but<00:04:28.050> uh<00:04:29.360> this<00:04:30.360> right<00:04:30.630> here

00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:31.580 
if you like um but uh this right here

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:36.560 
if you like um but uh this right here
just<00:04:32.580> the<00:04:32.700> latch<00:04:32.880> just<00:04:33.180> goes<00:04:33.930> into<00:04:34.320> the<00:04:35.570> this

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:36.570 
just the latch just goes into the this

00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:38.720 
just the latch just goes into the this
other<00:04:36.840> end<00:04:37.140> gate<00:04:37.410> which<00:04:38.010> turns<00:04:38.340> off<00:04:38.520> this

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:38.730 
other end gate which turns off this

00:04:38.730 --> 00:04:43.640 
other end gate which turns off this
torch<00:04:39.060> right<00:04:39.450> here<00:04:39.810> arm<00:04:41.450> and<00:04:42.620> pretty<00:04:43.620> much

00:04:43.640 --> 00:04:43.650 
torch right here arm and pretty much

00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:45.770 
torch right here arm and pretty much
this<00:04:43.890> access<00:04:44.310> our<00:04:44.460> enabler<00:04:45.180> right<00:04:45.390> here<00:04:45.540> just

00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:45.780 
this access our enabler right here just

00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:47.930 
this access our enabler right here just
like<00:04:45.930> in<00:04:46.169> the<00:04:46.230> beginning<00:04:46.440> you<00:04:46.860> know<00:04:47.760> with<00:04:47.910> the

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:47.940 
like in the beginning you know with the

00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:50.870 
like in the beginning you know with the
lever<00:04:48.210> it's<00:04:49.200> pretty<00:04:49.380> much<00:04:49.560> the<00:04:49.830> same<00:04:50.490> thing

00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:50.880 
lever it's pretty much the same thing

00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:53.450 
lever it's pretty much the same thing
but<00:04:51.090> just<00:04:51.410> this<00:04:52.410> is<00:04:52.590> just<00:04:52.620> acting<00:04:52.890> like<00:04:53.250> the

00:04:53.450 --> 00:04:53.460 
but just this is just acting like the

00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:56.300 
but just this is just acting like the
lever<00:04:53.880> right<00:04:54.630> now<00:04:54.780> and<00:04:55.020> then<00:04:55.169> now<00:04:56.010> we<00:04:56.070> were

00:04:56.300 --> 00:04:56.310 
lever right now and then now we were

00:04:56.310 --> 00:04:58.250 
lever right now and then now we were
able<00:04:56.430> to<00:04:56.610> press<00:04:57.540> this<00:04:57.750> button<00:04:58.020> right<00:04:58.110> here

00:04:58.250 --> 00:04:58.260 
able to press this button right here

00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:02.230 
able to press this button right here
which<00:04:58.770> I've<00:04:58.919> added<00:04:59.100> a<00:05:00.080> to<00:05:01.080> unlock<00:05:01.560> the<00:05:01.740> door

00:05:02.230 --> 00:05:02.240 
which I've added a to unlock the door

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:04.760 
which I've added a to unlock the door
because<00:05:03.240> both<00:05:03.450> of<00:05:03.480> these<00:05:03.690> inputs<00:05:04.050> make<00:05:04.380> the

00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:04.770 
because both of these inputs make the

00:05:04.770 --> 00:05:06.320 
because both of these inputs make the
torches<00:05:05.100> go<00:05:05.280> off<00:05:05.400> and<00:05:05.700> then<00:05:05.790> turn<00:05:05.820> this<00:05:06.120> one<00:05:06.270> on

00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:06.330 
torches go off and then turn this one on

00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:10.760 
torches go off and then turn this one on
and<00:05:07.140> it<00:05:07.230> opens<00:05:07.470> the<00:05:07.590> door<00:05:08.930> see<00:05:09.930> that's<00:05:10.200> just<00:05:10.260> an

00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:10.770 
and it opens the door see that's just an

00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:12.710 
and it opens the door see that's just an
example<00:05:10.950> of<00:05:11.490> how<00:05:11.700> you<00:05:11.730> would<00:05:12.180> have<00:05:12.330> combined

00:05:12.710 --> 00:05:12.720 
example of how you would have combined

00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:17.900 
example of how you would have combined
some<00:05:13.940> logic<00:05:14.940> gates<00:05:15.120> and<00:05:15.390> the<00:05:16.250> this<00:05:17.250> is<00:05:17.430> pretty

00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:17.910 
some logic gates and the this is pretty

00:05:17.910 --> 00:05:20.570 
some logic gates and the this is pretty
much<00:05:18.090> where<00:05:18.990> redstone<00:05:19.680> starts<00:05:20.100> getting<00:05:20.370> like

00:05:20.570 --> 00:05:20.580 
much where redstone starts getting like

00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:23.330 
much where redstone starts getting like
really<00:05:21.110> complicated<00:05:22.110> and<00:05:22.380> fun<00:05:22.830> and<00:05:23.040> very

00:05:23.330 --> 00:05:23.340 
really complicated and fun and very

00:05:23.340 --> 00:05:25.070 
really complicated and fun and very
interesting<00:05:23.940> and<00:05:24.090> not<00:05:24.270> really<00:05:24.450> like<00:05:24.690> boring

00:05:25.070 --> 00:05:25.080 
interesting and not really like boring

00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:26.810 
interesting and not really like boring
or<00:05:25.200> whatever<00:05:25.440> if<00:05:25.710> you<00:05:26.250> think<00:05:26.430> it's<00:05:26.550> boring

00:05:26.810 --> 00:05:26.820 
or whatever if you think it's boring

00:05:26.820 --> 00:05:30.320 
or whatever if you think it's boring
some<00:05:27.450> people<00:05:27.690> actually<00:05:27.750> do<00:05:28.080> so<00:05:28.400> yeah<00:05:29.400> I<00:05:29.669> just

00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:30.330 
some people actually do so yeah I just

00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:31.730 
some people actually do so yeah I just
wanted<00:05:30.660> to<00:05:30.690> show<00:05:30.870> you<00:05:30.900> guys<00:05:31.050> real<00:05:31.350> quick<00:05:31.380> this

00:05:31.730 --> 00:05:31.740 
wanted to show you guys real quick this

00:05:31.740 --> 00:05:34.190 
wanted to show you guys real quick this
will<00:05:32.340> show<00:05:32.520> you<00:05:32.580> guys<00:05:33.150> this<00:05:33.600> real<00:05:33.990> quick

00:05:34.190 --> 00:05:34.200 
will show you guys this real quick

00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:37.330 
will show you guys this real quick
because<00:05:34.590> you<00:05:35.010> know<00:05:35.130> so<00:05:35.370> you<00:05:35.460> guys<00:05:35.520> could

00:05:37.330 --> 00:05:37.340 
because you know so you guys could

00:05:37.340 --> 00:05:40.760 
because you know so you guys could
understand<00:05:38.340> and<00:05:38.640> what<00:05:39.140> type<00:05:40.140> of<00:05:40.169> stuff<00:05:40.650> you

00:05:40.760 --> 00:05:40.770 
understand and what type of stuff you

00:05:40.770 --> 00:05:43.730 
understand and what type of stuff you
can<00:05:40.800> do<00:05:41.160> with<00:05:41.190> redstone<00:05:41.880> and<00:05:42.530> from<00:05:43.530> here<00:05:43.680> I

00:05:43.730 --> 00:05:43.740 
can do with redstone and from here I

00:05:43.740 --> 00:05:47.930 
can do with redstone and from here I
guess<00:05:44.040> you<00:05:44.220> would<00:05:44.370> a<00:05:45.080> this<00:05:46.490> redstone<00:05:47.490> until

00:05:47.930 --> 00:05:47.940 
guess you would a this redstone until

00:05:47.940 --> 00:05:49.430 
guess you would a this redstone until
your<00:05:48.090> heart's<00:05:48.300> content<00:05:48.419> i<00:05:48.720> guess<00:05:48.900> or<00:05:49.169> just

00:05:49.430 --> 00:05:49.440 
your heart's content i guess or just

00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:51.219 
your heart's content i guess or just
wire<00:05:49.650> a<00:05:49.680> whole<00:05:50.100> bunch<00:05:50.280> of<00:05:50.340> stuff<00:05:50.400> up<00:05:50.729> you<00:05:50.880> know

00:05:51.219 --> 00:05:51.229 
wire a whole bunch of stuff up you know

00:05:51.229 --> 00:05:55.280 
wire a whole bunch of stuff up you know
i<00:05:52.520> guess<00:05:53.520> i<00:05:53.700> like<00:05:53.940> i<00:05:54.030> said<00:05:54.210> buffer<00:05:54.720> layer<00:05:54.960> will

00:05:55.280 --> 00:05:55.290 
i guess i like i said buffer layer will

00:05:55.290 --> 00:05:57.040 
i guess i like i said buffer layer will
be<00:05:55.380> making<00:05:55.560> a<00:05:55.740> tutorial<00:05:55.890> for<00:05:56.250> this<00:05:56.400> right<00:05:56.700> here
