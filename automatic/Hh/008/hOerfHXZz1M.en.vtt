00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:13.530 
garden so let's take a look did a lot of

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:17.019 
garden so let's take a look did a lot of
thinning<00:00:14.070> for<00:00:14.099> these<00:00:14.519> Bush<00:00:15.299> variety<00:00:15.900> Peas

00:00:17.019 --> 00:00:17.029 
thinning for these Bush variety Peas

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:19.849 
thinning for these Bush variety Peas
these<00:00:18.029> are<00:00:18.210> the<00:00:18.270> ones<00:00:18.420> we<00:00:18.600> planted<00:00:19.410> directly

00:00:19.849 --> 00:00:19.859 
these are the ones we planted directly

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:23.779 
these are the ones we planted directly
into<00:00:20.130> the<00:00:20.220> ground<00:00:22.070> we<00:00:23.070> did<00:00:23.189> not<00:00:23.340> start<00:00:23.670> them

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:23.789 
into the ground we did not start them

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:26.740 
into the ground we did not start them
off<00:00:23.910> as<00:00:24.119> seedlings<00:00:24.570> in<00:00:24.779> the<00:00:24.900> house<00:00:25.550> artichokes

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:26.750 
off as seedlings in the house artichokes

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:32.240 
off as seedlings in the house artichokes
they're<00:00:27.750> gone<00:00:27.960> and<00:00:29.480> now<00:00:30.480> that<00:00:31.250> planting

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:32.250 
they're gone and now that planting

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:34.160 
they're gone and now that planting
season<00:00:32.610> is<00:00:32.669> really<00:00:32.910> in<00:00:33.030> full<00:00:33.329> swing<00:00:33.899> around

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:34.170 
season is really in full swing around

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:37.610 
season is really in full swing around
here<00:00:35.239> we<00:00:36.239> can't<00:00:36.480> find<00:00:36.719> any<00:00:36.930> more<00:00:37.110> seeds<00:00:37.380> here

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:37.620 
here we can't find any more seeds here

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:39.020 
here we can't find any more seeds here
locally<00:00:38.010> either<00:00:38.219> so<00:00:38.489> that's<00:00:38.640> probably<00:00:38.820> just

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.030 
locally either so that's probably just

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:39.850 
locally either so that's probably just
not<00:00:39.239> going<00:00:39.390> to<00:00:39.450> happen

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:39.860 
not going to happen

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:43.580 
not going to happen
what<00:00:40.860> a<00:00:40.890> pretty<00:00:41.480> long-lasting<00:00:42.480> rain<00:00:42.809> and<00:00:43.260> I

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:43.590 
what a pretty long-lasting rain and I

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:47.450 
what a pretty long-lasting rain and I
think<00:00:43.829> that<00:00:44.149> did<00:00:45.149> a<00:00:45.180> bit<00:00:45.360> of<00:00:45.480> damage<00:00:45.690> to<00:00:46.460> some

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:47.460 
think that did a bit of damage to some

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:52.369 
think that did a bit of damage to some
of<00:00:47.579> our<00:00:47.730> lower<00:00:47.940> crops<00:00:48.500> these<00:00:49.500> are<00:00:49.739> the<00:00:51.379> leaf

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
of our lower crops these are the leaf

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:56.900 
of our lower crops these are the leaf
lettuce<00:00:53.420> and<00:00:54.420> then<00:00:54.629> down<00:00:54.809> here<00:00:54.840> probably<00:00:55.910> not

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910 
lettuce and then down here probably not

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:58.790 
lettuce and then down here probably not
even<00:00:57.090> we're<00:00:57.360> trying<00:00:57.660> to<00:00:57.780> get<00:00:57.930> to<00:00:58.050> show<00:00:58.289> up<00:00:58.500> for

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
even we're trying to get to show up for

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:00.830 
even we're trying to get to show up for
you<00:00:58.920> but<00:00:59.160> there's<00:00:59.969> a<00:01:00.059> little<00:01:00.449> bit<00:01:00.600> of<00:01:00.750> these

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
you but there's a little bit of these

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:02.650 
you but there's a little bit of these
onions<00:01:01.260> still<00:01:01.559> trying<00:01:01.829> to<00:01:01.890> straggle<00:01:02.430> on

00:01:02.650 --> 00:01:02.660 
onions still trying to straggle on

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:04.789 
onions still trying to straggle on
hopefully<00:01:03.660> they'll<00:01:03.840> make<00:01:03.870> it<00:01:04.229> but<00:01:04.470> probably

00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:04.799 
hopefully they'll make it but probably

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:09.310 
hopefully they'll make it but probably
not<00:01:05.220> the<00:01:05.880> potatoes<00:01:06.360> have<00:01:06.510> really<00:01:06.780> taken<00:01:07.110> off

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:09.320 

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:11.840 

obviously<00:01:10.320> those<00:01:10.770> were<00:01:10.799> started<00:01:11.250> outside<00:01:11.610> as

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
obviously those were started outside as

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:14.840 
obviously those were started outside as

I've<00:01:55.799> heard<00:01:55.920> recently<00:01:56.360> come<00:01:57.360> from<00:01:57.390> Paul<00:01:57.780> with

00:01:58.639 --> 00:01:58.649 
I've heard recently come from Paul with

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:00.410 
I've heard recently come from Paul with
his<00:01:58.680> back<00:01:59.340> to<00:01:59.490> Eden<00:01:59.579> method<00:01:59.969> I<00:02:00.060> don't<00:02:00.210> remember

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:00.420 
his back to Eden method I don't remember

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:03.499 
his back to Eden method I don't remember
seeing<00:02:00.810> it<00:02:00.990> in<00:02:01.110> the<00:02:01.290> in<00:02:01.590> the<00:02:02.070> video<00:02:02.450> but<00:02:03.450> I

00:02:03.499 --> 00:02:03.509 
seeing it in the in the video but I

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:05.060 
seeing it in the in the video but I
heard<00:02:03.659> him<00:02:03.810> talking<00:02:04.170> about<00:02:04.229> don't<00:02:04.680> start<00:02:04.979> your

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:05.070 
heard him talking about don't start your

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:07.210 
heard him talking about don't start your
seeds<00:02:05.340> inside<00:02:05.790> start<00:02:06.240> him<00:02:06.329> in<00:02:06.450> the<00:02:06.540> ground<00:02:06.719> and

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:07.220 
seeds inside start him in the ground and

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:09.440 
seeds inside start him in the ground and
it<00:02:08.220> really<00:02:08.459> makes<00:02:08.729> sense<00:02:08.940> with<00:02:09.209> the<00:02:09.270> whole

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:09.450 
it really makes sense with the whole

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:11.920 
it really makes sense with the whole
mindset<00:02:10.349> of<00:02:10.709> back<00:02:11.250> to<00:02:11.459> Eden

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:11.930 
mindset of back to Eden

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:14.229 
mindset of back to Eden
but<00:02:12.709> at<00:02:12.829> the<00:02:12.920> same<00:02:13.069> time<00:02:13.310> I'm<00:02:13.430> seeing<00:02:13.640> it<00:02:13.819> here

00:02:14.229 --> 00:02:14.239 
but at the same time I'm seeing it here

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:01.700 
should be planted into the ground but

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:04.240
