00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:21.080
 Welcome to cooking step by step today 

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:24.050
 I'm going to show you how to prepare rolled 

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:28.090
 of meat using minced meat these 

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:28.090
 are the ingredients that we are going to use 

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:39.940
 It is a recipe for six people 

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:45.350
 let's use two eggs let's 

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:48.050
 mix with the minced meat 

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:50.089
 the other 6 eggs are going to boil the 

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:52.140
 for 15 minutes to make eggs 

00:00:50.089 --> 00:00:57.760
 hard 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:01:00.960
 and we will add pepper salt to the meat 

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:00.960
 we keep mixing 

00:01:05.370 --> 00:01:09.390
 in this case you can see that it is better 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:12.000
 mix with a fork because if not 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:14.250
 it's going to mix well we add cheese 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:17.360
 grated me here I am using cheese 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:17.360
 shredded parmesan 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:23.579
 and we add bread crumbs 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:26.189
 as you can see it is a little color 

00:01:23.579 --> 00:01:28.850
 green because it's a breadcrumb with 

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:28.850
 Provencal herbs 

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:34.120
 we mix well it is important that 

00:01:31.719 --> 00:01:36.610
 the well-mixed meat 

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:39.130
 so that later it will not open and we will 

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:41.410
 use a cut plastic bag 

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:43.960
 in the middle we will put the meat on the 

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:46.150
 bag and let's give it a shape 

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:47.650
 rectangular has to look good 

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:51.870
 compact 

00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:51.870
 so that it does not open in the oven 

00:01:54.120 --> 00:02:00.560
 then with our hands we will crush 

00:01:56.220 --> 00:02:00.560
 well until we have something like that 

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:06.810
 and we will put the mortadella can be 

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:06.810
 also cooked ham 

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:10.700
 let's go laying the eggs 

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:15.030
 but in the 6 eggs inside the 

00:02:12.459 --> 00:02:15.030
 rolled 

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:24.390
 and we put the gruyere cheese cut into 

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:24.390
 blades 

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:30.330
 next to the eggs 

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:33.590
 so that this way is the most 

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:33.590
 easy to close 

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:41.450
 once we have it ready we are going to 

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:43.390
 help with the plastic and we will go 

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:45.730
 closing 

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:48.240
 let's go closing and squeezing well 

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:48.240
 strong 

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:53.670
 without leaving the plastic inside 

00:02:50.459 --> 00:02:56.040
 we are going to remove the plastic and go 

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:58.760
 to continue turning the 

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:58.760
 rolled 

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:08.580
 we keep turning 

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:13.520
 to give it all the way 

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:13.520
 and that it is well closed and well compact 

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:23.209
 As you can see on the edges there is a 

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:27.340
 little bit open so let's go 

00:03:23.209 --> 00:03:27.340
 closing the one side and the other 

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:36.880
 And now we have ready the wound 

00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:39.069
 ready to put it in the oven we are going to 

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:41.230
 put it in a baking dish with 

00:03:39.069 --> 00:03:43.590
 olive oil down so it does not get 

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:43.590
 stick 

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:48.440
 the part of the union of minced meat 

00:03:46.070 --> 00:03:51.590
 let's leave it below so that it does not 

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:53.230
 open up and let's put olive oil 

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:55.209
 from above 

00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:58.150
 we moisten the coil well 

00:03:55.209 --> 00:04:01.200
 olive oil and let's put 

00:03:58.150 --> 00:04:01.200
 bread crumbs 

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:08.030
 and some grated cheese also for 

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:08.030
 up to make it more crispy 

00:04:08.350 --> 00:04:14.190
 for itself to the preheated oven to 200 

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:14.190
 degrees 

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:20.270
 about a half hour and to 

00:04:18.230 --> 00:04:22.130
 be sure we will take it out of the oven 

00:04:20.270 --> 00:04:24.970
 We cut to see that the meat is well 

00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:29.110
 made that we do not remain raw inside 

00:04:24.970 --> 00:04:32.300
 and cut it into 1 centimeter mushrooms 

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:35.000
 centimeter and a half and we have ready the 

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:37.730
