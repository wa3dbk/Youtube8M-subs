they're just played so well in all five
games<00:01:15.390> I<00:01:15.689> thought<00:01:15.960> Luther<00:01:16.350> Burrell<00:01:16.619> has<00:01:16.950> taken

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
games I thought Luther Burrell has taken

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:19.969 
games I thought Luther Burrell has taken
to<00:01:17.430> international<00:01:17.939> rugby<00:01:18.090> so<00:01:18.390> well<00:01:18.979> doesn't

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:19.979 
to international rugby so well doesn't

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:21.740 
to international rugby so well doesn't
look<00:01:20.130> out<00:01:20.340> a<00:01:20.369> place<00:01:20.670> that's<00:01:20.880> all<00:01:21.030> great<00:01:21.420> to<00:01:21.570> see

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
look out a place that's all great to see

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:24.950 
look out a place that's all great to see
another<00:01:22.049> Leeds<00:01:22.320> lab<00:01:22.560> doing<00:01:23.250> well<00:01:23.520> so<00:01:23.960> everyone

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960 
another Leeds lab doing well so everyone

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:26.179 
another Leeds lab doing well so everyone
who<00:01:25.049> got<00:01:25.170> their<00:01:25.320> chance<00:01:25.500> this<00:01:25.770> year<00:01:25.830> in<00:01:26.130> the

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189 
who got their chance this year in the

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:28.640 
who got their chance this year in the
Six<00:01:26.369> Nations<00:01:26.430> I<00:01:26.820> think<00:01:27.030> took<00:01:27.240> it<00:01:27.390> and<00:01:28.140> that's<00:01:28.530> a

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650 
Six Nations I think took it and that's a

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:32.300 
Six Nations I think took it and that's a
sign<00:01:28.860> of<00:01:28.890> a<00:01:29.329> very<00:01:30.329> good<00:01:30.540> squad<00:01:30.829> just<00:01:31.829> how<00:01:32.040> good

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310 
sign of a very good squad just how good

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:33.649 
sign of a very good squad just how good
will<00:01:32.520> become<00:01:32.759> more<00:01:32.939> apparent<00:01:33.000> with<00:01:33.540> the

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:33.659 
will become more apparent with the

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:35.480 
will become more apparent with the
ultimate<00:01:33.810> test<00:01:34.350> this<00:01:34.590> summer<00:01:34.920> against<00:01:35.400> the

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
ultimate test this summer against the

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:39.030

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:39.040 
world champions in their own backyard

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:41.850 
world champions in their own backyard
I<00:01:39.540> think<00:01:40.540> it's<00:01:40.690> great<00:01:40.840> for<00:01:41.140> us<00:01:41.230> to<00:01:41.470> see<00:01:41.650> where

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:41.860 
I think it's great for us to see where

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:43.320 
I think it's great for us to see where
we<00:01:41.980> are<00:01:42.100> as<00:01:42.250> a<00:01:42.280> team<00:01:42.370> I<00:01:42.730> think<00:01:42.760> this<00:01:42.970> tour<00:01:43.240> will

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:43.330
