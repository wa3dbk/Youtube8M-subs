00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:54.540 

it<00:02:53.140> probably<00:02:53.410> isn't<00:02:53.650> picking<00:02:54.040> up<00:02:54.130> as<00:02:54.280> good<00:02:54.430> as

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:54.550 
it probably isn't picking up as good as

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:57.949 
it probably isn't picking up as good as
in<00:02:54.670> real<00:02:54.880> life<00:02:55.120> but

00:02:57.949 --> 00:02:57.959
