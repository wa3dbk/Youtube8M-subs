00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:37.790 
demonstration and I really wouldn't

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:39.940 
demonstration and I really wouldn't

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:43.780 
recommend you to put the volume up that
loud<00:01:40.190> at<00:01:41.180> least<00:01:41.540> as<00:01:41.840> you<00:01:42.290> heard<00:01:42.560> not<00:01:43.550> in<00:01:43.700> a

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:47.810 
because the qc25

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:51.340 
because the qc25
do<00:01:48.620> leak<00:01:49.070> there<00:01:50.000> the<00:01:50.210> sound<00:01:50.390> 100<00:01:50.870> percent<00:01:51.229> of

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:51.350 
do leak there the sound 100 percent of

do leak there the sound 100 percent of
volume<00:01:51.680> at<00:01:51.830> 50%<00:01:52.280> volume<00:01:53.410> where<00:01:54.410> you<00:01:54.530> have<00:01:54.710> a
