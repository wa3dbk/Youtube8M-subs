 do now because it is practically I have to 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:28.769
 do it tomorrow but I'm doing it today 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:30.390
 because he knows for those who are better off than call of 

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:32.369
 duty or injury by registering them with a call of 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:34.230
 duty a video of known in stupendous 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:36.390
 he was coming but I realized that he was 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:39.000
 I was recording with history then 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:41.070
 the video went to hell today that 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.510
 came to revise the whole again 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:44.730
 my gaming station since it is 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:46.260
 anyway I showed it a year ago and 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:48.360
 returning to fasano they have not changed 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:52.379
 really a lot of things 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:53.610
 I am moving to death I am 

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:54.600
 angry worked we say that for 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:56.850
 make when i use e 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:59.579
 especially a trick there is no trick 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:01.500
 on how precisely I can use the ps4 

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:03.090
 via computer headphones via 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:04.799
 some magheggi that now anyway 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:06.930
 I will then show and start immediately and 

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:07.380
 Let's start to show you the popstar year 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:09.479
 FIOM 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:11.460
 I said new but actually not new 

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:13.170
 it is because the corner is always sad but there 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:15.270
 are things added then in practice 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:17.280
 mauto I'm obviously giving in niger that 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:19.530
 I destroyed that president soon 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:22.290
 I replace it with this wire of display cases 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:24.600
 g200 two prostheses which is cool to 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:27.090
 ways of mao that must still be 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:29.820

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:51.060
 games this is the monitor closed for the 

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:53.579

 mater the clever needle ie not tablet 

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:05.200

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:08.920
 keep it here movie controller 

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:11.140
 of the xbox and the ps4 respectively 

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:12.460
 keyboard the tripleta an excellent keyboard 

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:15.640
 that I'm really finding it 

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:17.590
 very well the mouse pad is 

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:19.960
 increasingly poor the aics that it is anyway 

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:21.820
 a great mouse pad for the 

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:24.250
 Magician below as you see we have the 

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:26.140
 fucking ps since when zeus decided 

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:28.060
 to hit me several times I started 

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:29.410
 in protection with this case of ups that 

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:31.150
 I have to say it works pretty well 

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:33.220
 manages to remi computer on for one 

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:35.080
 fifteen minutes when light goes away 

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:38.020
 so sti cocks and here we have the 

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:39.880
 supposes of the titan 2.1 

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:42.880
 obviously the strip to the right pussy 

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:44.650
 behind the post here we have the 

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:47.020
 computer that is practically not 

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:49.300
 changed if not that they now hide and 80 

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:51.160
 inside is practically the same as 

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:53.590
 so long ago so it hasn't changed 

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:55.060
 much now then many more or less 

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:56.140
 ie not typically asked when 

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:57.310
 I was doing the video on the console 

00:02:56.140 --> 00:03:00.760
 we ask you how the fuck he did 

00:02:57.310 --> 00:03:01.959
 use logitech g35 a with the ps4 for 

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:03.850
 nothing is not that the logitech are 

00:03:01.959 --> 00:03:06.910
 connected to ps 4 and logitech are 

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:09.010
 always connected to the computer and the ps4 

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:11.050
 to be connected to the computer 

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:13.510
 how practically the ps4 is 

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:16.000
 connected to the fifa monitor we are with 

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:18.190
 ridden hdmi cable never then transports 

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:21.040
 even audio from the monitor comes out a cable a 

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:22.660
 cable practically out that from the monitor yes 

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:24.730
 shoves the computer 

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:26.739
 in the blue entrance of the motherboard which 

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:29.140
 entry into practice then now 

00:03:26.739 --> 00:03:32.830
 I'll show you if I went to get up 

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:37.500
 the volume of the speakers is heard ps4 ma le 

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:40.900
 speakers are connected to the computer not now 

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:42.670
 it works and it's cool in practice like 

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:44.290
 what happens if mendes that seeing in the 

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:47.350
 pci was up to 

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:48.370
 recording we see incoming line 

00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:50.160
 this is my input e 

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:52.810
 practically the ps4 line 

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:55.090
 practically to use headphones 

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:57.850
 logical what to do key 

00:03:55.090 --> 00:04:00.190
 property right to listen 

00:03:57.850 --> 00:04:03.130
 listening and device that make africa 

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:05.230
 apply and practically now the ps4 yes 

00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:07.090
 feels in the headphones and is really one 

00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:08.410
 what obviously ends up feeling 

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:10.660
 to the headphones we have to presented as 

00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:12.580
 default device and logitech has 

00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:15.190
 however we are the headphones 

00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:18.250
 using this is a very cool trick 

00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:20.110
 what I have told me to do is that 

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:21.870
 precisely I wanted to propose it again because it is 

00:04:20.110 --> 00:04:24.220
 so cool not to have so 

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:26.470
 27,000 cus that in the midst of football like that 

00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:29.050
 with a headset room we can hear 

00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:29.860
 the sound of the ps4 in an excellent way that is 

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:31.030
 no quality is lost 

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:32.830
 obviously you can't use the 

00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:35.230
 microphone to talk because it's not there 

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:37.210
 microphone is for talking with friends 

00:04:35.230 --> 00:04:41.350
 on the ps4 I show you what the fuck 

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:43.030
 these headphones use trash master y 250gp 

00:04:41.350 --> 00:04:44.530
 that I lace it directly to the controller 

00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:47.680
 and I have to admit they work 

00:04:44.530 --> 00:04:50.140
 quite well enough and this is the 

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:53.740
 station in the dark look how fucking 

00:04:50.140 --> 00:04:55.810
 and daughter with the led all put there you 

00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:58.240
 grazio led didn't cost me a dick 

00:04:55.810 --> 00:05:00.610
 cost 10 euros 5 meters of law on 

00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:04.330
 amazon while the store for a meter 

00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:04.990
 they only wanted 15 euro amazon chews 

00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:06.490
 forever 

00:05:04.990 --> 00:05:07.990
 so guys for this video was 

00:05:06.490 --> 00:05:09.010
 all the notes to request a 

00:05:07.990 --> 00:05:10.420
 they are like mine has changed 

00:05:09.010 --> 00:05:12.010
 location as it is in the videos anyway 

00:05:10.420 --> 00:05:14.680
 it is not clear much since in any case 

00:05:12.010 --> 00:05:16.720
 very often I say change then do a 

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:18.130
 video every time things change 

00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:19.750
 really difficult because anyway 

00:05:18.130 --> 00:05:21.160
 it must be said that I often change with that 

00:05:19.750 --> 00:05:22.480
 sometimes we do these types of 

00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:24.760
 video so you see where soccer is 

00:05:22.480 --> 00:05:26.860
 absolute where they make videos and c 

00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:28.780
 so this was protection that that trick 

00:05:26.860 --> 00:05:30.700
 headphones were convenient because 

00:05:28.780 --> 00:05:32.260
 honestly it's like a lot to me 

00:05:30.700 --> 00:05:34.060
 especially use logitech and on 

00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:35.770
 ps 4 stateless without the need for 

00:05:34.060 --> 00:05:38.140
 also detaching from the computer is one 

00:05:35.770 --> 00:05:39.169
 absurd comfort I hope that everything is 

00:05:38.140 --> 00:05:40.909
 been clear even if not 

00:05:39.169 --> 00:05:42.860
 showed passages of any kind anyway 

00:05:40.909 --> 00:05:44.449
 you have to connect a shit at the end 

00:05:42.860 --> 00:05:46.189
 cable to the computer no longer needs to be done 

00:05:44.449 --> 00:05:49.150
 nothing so serve liked left 

00:05:46.189 --> 00:05:49.150
 a nice like he hello
