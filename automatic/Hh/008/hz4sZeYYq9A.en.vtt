00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:16.590 
already had the space for the battery so

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:18.910 
already had the space for the battery so
i<00:00:16.619> didn't<00:00:17.039> have<00:00:17.160> to<00:00:17.190> build<00:00:17.730> that<00:00:17.880> at<00:00:18.029> all

00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:18.920 
i didn't have to build that at all

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
Nintendo on a chip refers to a lot of

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:21.050 
Nintendo on a chip refers to a lot of
the<00:01:18.570> new<00:01:18.689> hardware<00:01:19.049> that<00:01:19.430> basically<00:01:20.430> copies

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
the new hardware that basically copies

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:23.090 
the new hardware that basically copies
an<00:01:21.330> original<00:01:21.810> NES<00:01:22.140> system<00:01:22.560> but<00:01:22.710> the<00:01:22.740> circuit

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
an original NES system but the circuit

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:25.370 
an original NES system but the circuit
board<00:01:23.189> is<00:01:23.340> really<00:01:23.790> really<00:01:23.939> small<00:01:24.090> you<00:01:25.049> can<00:01:25.200> see

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
board is really really small you can see

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:27.830 
board is really really small you can see
one<00:01:26.130> that<00:01:26.310> fried<00:01:26.580> before<00:01:26.970> the<00:01:27.119> whole<00:01:27.270> thing<00:01:27.630> is

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
one that fried before the whole thing is

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:29.810 
one that fried before the whole thing is
just<00:01:28.049> tiny<00:01:28.530> I<00:01:28.680> mean<00:01:28.860> this<00:01:28.979> emulates<00:01:29.430> an<00:01:29.579> entire

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
just tiny I mean this emulates an entire

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:33.230 
just tiny I mean this emulates an entire
NES<00:01:30.270> system<00:01:30.750> so<00:01:31.110> pretty<00:01:32.009> neat<00:01:32.189> and<00:01:32.490> then<00:01:32.850> you

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
NES system so pretty neat and then you

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:35.030 
NES system so pretty neat and then you
know<00:01:33.329> the<00:01:33.450> little<00:01:33.600> glop<00:01:33.960> top<00:01:34.259> chip<00:01:34.619> there<00:01:34.860> with

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.040 
know the little glop top chip there with

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:37.850 
know the little glop top chip there with
all<00:01:35.430> the<00:01:35.579> games<00:01:35.759> built<00:01:36.030> into<00:01:36.450> it<00:01:36.619> anyway<00:01:37.619> let's

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
all the games built into it anyway let's

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:41.990 
all the games built into it anyway let's
go<00:01:37.950> and<00:01:38.070> turn<00:01:38.130> this<00:01:38.310> on<00:01:40.280> you<00:01:41.280> can<00:01:41.400> see<00:01:41.579> kind<00:01:41.880> of

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
go and turn this on you can see kind of

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:43.969 
go and turn this on you can see kind of
kind<00:01:42.869> of<00:01:43.020> has<00:01:43.110> a<00:01:43.140> bright<00:01:43.380> corner<00:01:43.770> here<00:01:43.950> I

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:43.979 
kind of has a bright corner here I

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:45.590 
kind of has a bright corner here I
replace<00:01:44.460> it<00:01:44.640> rich<00:01:44.759> on<00:01:44.880> the<00:01:44.909> backlight<00:01:45.390> with

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
replace it rich on the backlight with

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:48.560 
replace it rich on the backlight with
two<00:01:45.810> LEDs<00:01:46.320> of<00:01:46.530> my<00:01:46.680> own<00:01:46.829> to<00:01:47.490> increase<00:01:48.450> the

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570 
two LEDs of my own to increase the

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:51.889 
two LEDs of my own to increase the
brightness<00:01:48.950> but<00:01:49.950> the<00:01:50.159> downside<00:01:50.280> was<00:01:50.759> it<00:01:51.479> is
