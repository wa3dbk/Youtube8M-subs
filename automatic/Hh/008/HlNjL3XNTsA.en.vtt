walking has all the benefits of running

00:03:51.099 --> 00:03:52.890 
walking has all the benefits of running
basically<00:03:51.699> you're<00:03:52.150> just<00:03:52.180> when<00:03:52.780> you're

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:52.900 
basically you're just when you're

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:56.039 
basically you're just when you're
running<00:03:53.109> you're<00:03:53.379> just<00:03:53.590> um<00:03:54.690> making<00:03:55.690> your<00:03:55.810> body

00:03:56.039 --> 00:03:56.049 
running you're just um making your body

00:03:56.049 --> 00:03:57.960 
running you're just um making your body
more<00:03:56.349> efficient<00:03:56.889> at<00:03:57.040> pumping<00:03:57.459> blood<00:03:57.609> through

00:03:57.960 --> 00:03:57.970 
more efficient at pumping blood through

00:03:57.970 --> 00:04:02.490 
more efficient at pumping blood through
your<00:03:58.389> heart<00:03:58.750> and<00:03:59.849> more<00:04:00.849> efficient<00:04:01.419> in<00:04:01.629> how

00:04:02.490 --> 00:04:02.500 
your heart and more efficient in how

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:04.920 
your heart and more efficient in how
much<00:04:02.650> air<00:04:02.859> you<00:04:02.889> can<00:04:03.250> take<00:04:03.459> in<00:04:03.639> in<00:04:03.819> a<00:04:04.629> certain

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:04.930 
much air you can take in in a certain

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:09.330 
much air you can take in in a certain
amount<00:04:05.079> of<00:04:05.199> time<00:04:06.569> so<00:04:07.620> now<00:04:08.620> that<00:04:08.829> that's<00:04:09.010> out<00:04:09.310> of

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:09.340 
amount of time so now that that's out of

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:13.490 
amount of time so now that that's out of
the<00:04:09.519> way<00:04:09.579> um<00:04:09.970> when<00:04:10.959> I<00:04:10.989> started<00:04:11.470> running<00:04:11.709> I

00:04:13.490 --> 00:04:13.500 
the way um when I started running I

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:17.659 
the way um when I started running I
could<00:04:14.500> only<00:04:14.709> run<00:04:15.250> for<00:04:15.849> about<00:04:15.940> 30<00:04:16.510> seconds<00:04:17.019> and

00:04:17.659 --> 00:04:17.669 
could only run for about 30 seconds and

00:04:17.669 --> 00:04:22.519 
could only run for about 30 seconds and
what<00:04:18.669> i<00:04:18.699> would<00:04:18.909> do<00:04:19.180> is<00:04:20.010> that<00:04:21.010> I<00:04:21.219> would<00:04:21.340> look<00:04:22.060> at

00:04:22.519 --> 00:04:22.529 
what i would do is that I would look at

00:04:22.529 --> 00:04:25.830 
what i would do is that I would look at
street<00:04:23.529> lights<00:04:23.770> and<00:04:24.099> I<00:04:25.060> would<00:04:25.330> run<00:04:25.599> between

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:25.840 
street lights and I would run between

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:26.970 
street lights and I would run between
street<00:04:26.500> lights

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:26.980 
street lights

00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:33.630 
street lights
um<00:04:28.230> looking<00:04:29.230> at<00:04:29.380> landmarks<00:04:30.300> and<00:04:32.640> judging

00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:33.640 
um looking at landmarks and judging

00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:36.600 
um looking at landmarks and judging
distance<00:04:34.330> by<00:04:34.570> that<00:04:35.190> hold<00:04:36.190> on<00:04:36.310> my<00:04:36.430> mom's

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:44.560 
saying is that when I started running or

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:51.390 
saying is that when I started running or
jogging<00:04:46.920> yeah<00:04:48.060> really<00:04:49.060> hard<00:04:49.860> and<00:04:50.860> then<00:04:51.100> I

00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:54.910 
found the couch to 5k program which I

00:04:54.910 --> 00:04:58.260 
found the couch to 5k program which I
strongly<00:04:55.630> suggest<00:04:56.260> that<00:04:56.940> anybody<00:04:57.940> who's

or<00:05:00.640> any<00:05:01.360> any<00:05:01.780> running<00:05:02.140> program<00:05:02.560> to<00:05:03.310> use<00:05:03.340> that

00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:03.820 
or any any running program to use that

00:05:03.820 --> 00:05:08.160

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:17.010 
good base for starting to build up your

00:05:17.010 --> 00:05:19.560 
good base for starting to build up your
running<00:05:18.010> program<00:05:18.490> and<00:05:18.820> there<00:05:19.090> are<00:05:19.210> so<00:05:19.420> many

00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:19.570 
running program and there are so many
