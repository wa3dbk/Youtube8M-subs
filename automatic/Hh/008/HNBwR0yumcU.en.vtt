as<00:04:19.870> I<00:04:19.930> said<00:04:20.169> before<00:04:20.609> the<00:04:21.609> same<00:04:21.849> game<00:04:22.090> but<00:04:22.120> with

00:04:22.409 --> 00:04:22.419 
as I said before the same game but with

00:04:22.419 --> 00:04:23.879 
as I said before the same game but with
a<00:04:22.449> lot<00:04:22.630> of<00:04:22.659> different<00:04:22.870> little<00:04:23.080> features<00:04:23.620> and
