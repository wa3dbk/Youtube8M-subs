00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:11.790
 God bless each one of you 

00:00:08.969 --> 00:00:16.110
 hear me 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:19.700
 in this channel today we are going to share the 

00:00:16.110 --> 00:00:25.739
 Word of God in the book of Isaiah 

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:30.240
 chapter 43 verses 1 and 2 see them 

00:00:25.739 --> 00:00:33.690
 well-known signs I invite you to 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:36.989
 his bible and noel with me and the word is 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:40.590
 reads in the name of the father of the son and 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:45.329
 of the holy spirit again 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:51.089
 and I knew 43 12 also 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:56.130
 Now that's what Jehovah says, created yours or 

00:00:51.089 --> 00:01:00.480
 jacob and formed yours or israel 

00:00:56.130 --> 00:01:04.000
 do not fear because I redeem you I put you 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:07.270
 my name is you 

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:12.750
 When you pass through the waters I will be 

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:17.980
 with you and if by the rivers they will not make you 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:21.390
 when you pass through the fire you will not burn 

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:25.830
 nor the llama to haiti 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:27.500
 let's pray for this word sir I give you 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:30.400
 Thank you 

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:32.780
 for the honor and privilege 

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:36.100
 this word sr 

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:38.680
 and mercy sr 

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:40.930
 I ask you sir understanding about the 

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:43.680
 same series 

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:47.360
 help us, Hallelujah 

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:47.360
 understand this word 

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:54.360
 I ask you all in the powerful name of 

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:54.360
 Jesus 

00:01:55.180 --> 00:02:02.420
 now we have 

00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:04.720
 in this story we have something good 

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:04.720
 interesting 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:10.850
 and we see Isaiah was a prophet of the 

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:13.760
 nation of israel 

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:19.040
 and in this time if we read the chapters 

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:23.569
 earlier we realize that israel 

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:27.400
 he had perverted Israel had taken 

00:02:23.569 --> 00:02:27.400
 something that was 

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:37.500
 who has created for good and had it 

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:40.490
 taken and abused and had done it wrong 

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:46.740
 God had established a system of 

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:50.910
 worship a coating system 

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:54.090
 and instead of taking advantage of this system the 

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:58.670
 man the people of israel 

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:58.670
 I had abused the same 

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:04.680
 converting high customs that the 

00:03:02.019 --> 00:03:07.219
 God had established in his word 

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:09.269
 the people of israel we are not living 

00:03:07.219 --> 00:03:11.489
 according to the word of the people of 

00:03:09.269 --> 00:03:15.450
 israel was not pleasing god it was 

00:03:11.489 --> 00:03:18.870
 they were moving away from God 

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:22.430
 but how nice that even with all that 

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:26.970
 when God speaks to the people of Israel 

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:32.280
 he says now like that says jehovah creator 

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:37.019
 yours or jacob and formed yours or israel 

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:40.410
 do not fear because I gave you my I put you 

00:03:37.019 --> 00:03:41.880
 my name he is that interesting that you 

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:46.440
 says look 

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:50.190
 You are jacob which I created you 

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:53.850
 you are israel that I have formed and if 

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:56.700
 jacob know the history of Israel you 

00:03:53.850 --> 00:04:00.600
 realize that it is the same person 

00:03:56.700 --> 00:04:03.510
 jacob means deceiver paco was a 

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:06.870
 man liar jacob represents the 

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:09.870
 jacob meat represents the state 

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:12.870
 original man and how interesting 

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:15.810
 that God speaks to his people, he says 

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:19.560
 I know who you are but also 

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:24.480
 I know that I have created you are you 

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:27.800
 Jacob but I trained you in Israel 

00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:32.000
 How nice that God looks at us 

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:35.490
 know our condition our condition 

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:39.030
 sinful but when he looks at us he looks at us 

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:42.120
 through the eyes of Jesus Christ and 

00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:44.430
 says if I know you are jacob 

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:48.840
 but I also know that in you 

00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:53.430
 formed an israel you are a fighter you 

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:58.260
 you are mine you are mine I paid a price 

00:04:53.430 --> 00:05:02.040
 for you I redeem you and therefore as I 

00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:05.580
 I have received when you pass through the waters 

00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:08.970
 I will be with you and if by the rivers 

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:13.140
 you will be flooded when you pass through the fire 

00:05:08.970 --> 00:05:16.560
 you will burn or flame them alter in you 

00:05:13.140 --> 00:05:18.030
 realize that it does not say if you're going to 

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:21.300
 go through the waters 

00:05:18.030 --> 00:05:25.560
 If you're going to go through the fire, do not 

00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:27.210
 it says when I mean everything in everything 

00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:29.729

00:05:41.430 --> 00:05:46.650
 you are a servant of god and when god 

00:05:43.889 --> 00:05:49.949
 he looks at you he does not look at you through the eyes of 

00:05:46.650 --> 00:05:52.650
 Jacob looks at you like an Israeli like a 

00:05:49.949 --> 00:05:56.099
