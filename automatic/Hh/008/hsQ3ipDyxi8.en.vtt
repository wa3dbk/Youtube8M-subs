00:00:04.820 --> 00:00:07.210
 in this tournament buy some kind of mobile beatu 

00:00:07.210 --> 00:00:10.109
 that we are still elections 

00:00:10.109 --> 00:00:12.199
 rear-wheel drive so front-wheel drive 

00:00:12.199 --> 00:00:13.699
 four-wheel drive 

00:00:13.699 --> 00:00:16.529
 but of course she knowingly says that such that 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:18.739
 when performing stock 

00:00:18.739 --> 00:00:21.299
 because first and foremost not used 

00:00:21.299 --> 00:00:22.449
 safe and the winner 

00:00:22.449 --> 00:00:24.079
 safer 

00:00:24.079 --> 00:00:26.719
 and everyone has a drive 

00:00:26.719 --> 00:00:28.549
 its pros and cons if you can so 

00:00:28.549 --> 00:00:31.249
 express actually from the first 

00:00:31.249 --> 00:00:34.019
 champion n think about see almost 

00:00:34.019 --> 00:00:35.799
 off-road that he is nothing you 8 not 

00:00:35.799 --> 00:00:37.859
 did but off-road 

00:00:37.859 --> 00:00:40.269
 car assessment need to order 

00:00:40.269 --> 00:00:42.780
 riding on gifts gives joy in 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:44.760
 Second, many people buy to launch 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:47.229
 portal chubarkin other about pedestrian 

00:00:47.229 --> 00:00:49.179
 and for parking snowdrifts 

00:00:49.179 --> 00:00:51.070
 near the house and so on 

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:54.470
 but about many May 10, a little meter 

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:55.610
 of course use them by 

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:57.580
 purpose and of course it is considered that 

00:00:57.580 --> 00:00:59.880
 the roadside is actually and not the most 

00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:02.300
 safe in terms of management to 

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:04.580
 and why it is their least for the night why 

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:06.670
 here everyone is very satisfied and so on 

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:08.189
 of course it is not created but 

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:10.450
 automaker access sell 

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:12.840
 basically these expensive cars 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:14.980
 and until then ar 

00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:17.030
 let's figure out the power really a 

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:19.120
 Pavilion Road Fund author of operas 

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:22.070
 trickster first of all why but because 

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:24.590
 she lives on gas on a slippery road 

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:26.350
 it accelerates to the third all 

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:28.109
 cars which in which not 

00:01:28.109 --> 00:01:29.689
 off-road paramon driven 

00:01:29.689 --> 00:01:31.860
 hall yes I have even faster 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:33.780
 but to stop just like 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:35.170
 ordinary car 

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:37.299
 and the effect is a feeling that murat 

00:01:37.299 --> 00:01:38.880
 then it accelerates well 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:40.229
 all on the trail the fastest should 

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:41.150
 stay 

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:42.980
 Of course not because he spends 

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:44.740
 first wheeled because all the same 

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:46.210
 etc 

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:48.680
 and therefore while driving on an SUV 

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:50.610
 you need to be extremely careful it is you 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:52.970
 with that feeling that I'm speeding up 

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:54.150
 OK 

00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:56.470
 but I will stop as online 

00:01:56.470 --> 00:01:58.250
 this must be remembered of course 

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:00.670
 SUV niu vshe them already turns 

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:03.050
 in a regular ward yes most 

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:04.020
 off-road property 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:05.610
 the car is whether it's good 

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:07.000
 whether on the road 

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:08.759
 long walks designs 

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:10.210
 SUV won't go into 

00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:12.340
 details of each and every 

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:14.150
 choose an appointment for himself 

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:16.410
 car and two such blows he wants 

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:19.150
 use it year but if we will 

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:20.679
 consider true 

00:02:20.679 --> 00:02:24.009
 SUVs in general their mother is always who it is 

00:02:24.009 --> 00:02:26.119
 cars you need to drive at all 

00:02:26.119 --> 00:02:28.119
 other cars that pirelli 

00:02:28.119 --> 00:02:30.289
 imported to knit nice actually 

00:02:30.289 --> 00:02:32.149
 and a modern car in which 

00:02:32.149 --> 00:02:34.659
 have a microphone system will fight the system 

00:02:34.659 --> 00:02:37.219
 there is n and in principle can be considered without 

00:02:37.219 --> 00:02:37.919
 arrived 

00:02:37.919 --> 00:02:39.449
 since the system if it 

00:02:39.449 --> 00:02:41.259
 prevents the slip leading 

00:02:41.259 --> 00:02:43.519
 wheels and so here is digging a drive on 

00:02:43.519 --> 00:02:45.199
 really not very correct 

00:02:45.199 --> 00:02:46.239
 and therefore 

00:02:46.239 --> 00:02:48.459
 if we celebrate systems and historians 

00:02:48.459 --> 00:02:50.829
 we give ourselves a igor car maybe 

00:02:50.829 --> 00:02:52.680
 there are free wheel spin 

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:54.870
 friends yes respondent shelter definitely 

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:57.379
 there is and since the system with n 

00:02:57.379 --> 00:02:59.510
 this is noted by someone in the city 

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:01.459
 In this case, this car can 

00:03:01.459 --> 00:03:02.430
 count homeless
