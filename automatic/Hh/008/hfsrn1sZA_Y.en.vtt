on<00:02:22.610> this<00:02:22.790> side<00:02:23.950> so<00:02:24.950> wrap<00:02:25.129> around<00:02:25.430> you<00:02:25.489> might

00:02:25.569 --> 00:02:25.579 
on this side so wrap around you might

00:02:25.579 --> 00:02:26.649 
on this side so wrap around you might
have<00:02:25.670> to<00:02:25.760> push<00:02:25.939> it<00:02:26.060> over<00:02:26.299> a<00:02:26.329> little<00:02:26.450> and

00:02:26.649 --> 00:02:26.659 
have to push it over a little and

00:02:26.659 --> 00:02:29.350 
have to push it over a little and

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:15.680 
the best way I've figured out so far

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:16.690 
the best way I've figured out so far
I've<00:03:15.770> been<00:03:15.890> doing<00:03:16.100> it<00:03:16.190> for<00:03:16.220> about<00:03:16.400> ten<00:03:16.670> years

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:16.700 
I've been doing it for about ten years

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:18.550 
I've been doing it for about ten years
but<00:03:17.209> I've<00:03:17.390> never<00:03:17.600> used<00:03:17.780> a<00:03:17.959> brush<00:03:18.110> guard<00:03:18.350> until

00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:18.560 
but I've never used a brush guard until

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:20.050 
but I've never used a brush guard until
this<00:03:18.800> year<00:03:18.860> and<00:03:19.190> that<00:03:19.280> brush<00:03:19.520> guards<00:03:19.820> all<00:03:19.970> the

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:20.060 
this year and that brush guards all the

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:21.820 
this year and that brush guards all the
more<00:03:20.180> thing<00:03:20.390> I<00:03:20.540> tie<00:03:21.080> a<00:03:21.110> simple<00:03:21.380> knot<00:03:21.530> you<00:03:21.800> can

00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:21.830 
more thing I tie a simple knot you can

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:23.380 
more thing I tie a simple knot you can
tie<00:03:22.040> a<00:03:22.070> complex<00:03:22.550> knot<00:03:22.820> and<00:03:23.000> it<00:03:23.150> will<00:03:23.240> probably

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:23.390 
tie a complex knot and it will probably

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:26.080 
tie a complex knot and it will probably
hold<00:03:23.630> fine<00:03:23.959> but<00:03:24.280> take<00:03:25.280> your<00:03:25.400> knot<00:03:25.610> and<00:03:25.910> take

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:26.090 
hold fine but take your knot and take

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:29.080 
hold fine but take your knot and take
superglue<00:03:26.660> and<00:03:26.870> just<00:03:27.470> just<00:03:28.370> touch<00:03:28.670> that<00:03:28.700> not

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:29.090 
superglue and just just touch that not

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:32.020 
superglue and just just touch that not
just<00:03:29.240> get<00:03:29.540> a<00:03:29.570> DAB<00:03:29.870> on<00:03:30.080> there<00:03:30.260> and<00:03:30.430> I<00:03:31.430> use<00:03:31.820> one

00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:32.030 
just get a DAB on there and I use one

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:34.270
