00:00:03.730 --> 00:00:05.730
 and 

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:09.170
 and 

00:00:16.050 --> 00:00:19.570
 hello to all today we get 

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:22.090
 found for the third and the last 

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:24.329
 dungeon in the update 2.4 the temple 

00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:26.320
 of carn in brutal mode or art mode 

00:00:24.329 --> 00:00:27.759
 maybe the dungeon that was the most 

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:30.610
 complicated besides of all the dungeons 

00:00:27.759 --> 00:00:32.019
 low level then as for all my 

00:00:30.610 --> 00:00:33.820
 dungeon guide videos I do not 

00:00:32.019 --> 00:00:35.970
 speak here only own boss 

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:38.350
 we will start with the first 

00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:40.420
 the damaged adjudicator you have 

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:41.800
 surely already already recognized then 

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:42.610
 the boss has a lot of health and 

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:44.680
 to destroy it 

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:47.440
 we'll have to attack one of 

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:48.730
 its members or reduce it to pieces and 

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:50.829
 that's what will happen to him a lot of 

00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:52.449
 points of life then the party to dps is 

00:00:50.829 --> 00:00:54.129
 random and whenever he own 

00:00:52.449 --> 00:00:56.710
 to they will have as normal know 

00:00:54.129 --> 00:00:58.570
 press order it will disappear 

00:00:56.710 --> 00:00:59.859
 very fast by the way but if you have it 

00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:01.359
 missed it's not very serious you'll 

00:00:59.859 --> 00:01:02.829
 just to destroy each of these parts 

00:01:01.359 --> 00:01:04.809
 one to one before you find the 

00:01:02.829 --> 00:01:07.060
 good and once it will be reduced in 

00:01:04.809 --> 00:01:08.590
 pieces it will kill add up 

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:09.910
 what he comes back again three 

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:13.090
 main day spider species 

00:01:09.910 --> 00:01:14.140
 fronts he also has a cleese that's 

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:15.759
 for that he will always have 

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:17.590
 that time never turns 

00:01:15.759 --> 00:01:19.240
 towards the party he also possesses 

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:21.880
 besides an error online that is 

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:23.200
 very very simple to avoid and it will 

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:26.649
 score on the year players 

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:28.509
 randomly a mark shortly after a 

00:01:26.649 --> 00:01:29.950
 horde will reappear he will already open in 

00:01:28.509 --> 00:01:31.800
 loop actually makes very thought about 

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:34.450
 last boss of the castle lady of intake 

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:36.429
 and for the last attack that can 

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:38.440
 use it will make people sands 

00:01:36.429 --> 00:01:39.819
 shifting somewhere on the area then 

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:40.959
 it can take a lot of the 

00:01:39.819 --> 00:01:41.560
 area is so you have to do very 

00:01:40.959 --> 00:01:44.770
 Warning 

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:46.509
 there will be just to go out so sands 

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:47.979
 shifting if ever you're in and 

00:01:46.509 --> 00:01:50.410
 continue with all these mechanics there 

00:01:47.979 --> 00:01:52.479
 until the boss are dead that's it 

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:54.849
 we will now go to the second 

00:01:52.479 --> 00:01:56.229
 bump in the area 

00:01:54.849 --> 00:01:58.300
 so here we are against the second bone of 

00:01:56.229 --> 00:01:59.920
 the area does them the empress pampa 

00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:01.479
 followed by two pumps not 

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:02.979
 soldiers who are very simple to kill 

00:02:01.479 --> 00:02:05.020
 in the first attack she 

00:02:02.979 --> 00:02:06.280
 will use and three thousand needles and if 

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:07.030
 you know shapes not after 

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:10.030
 all goes 

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:11.709
 that means 3000 points of damage but 

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:13.870
 it will launch in the form of a game at 

00:02:11.709 --> 00:02:14.709
 very simple soil to avoid which does this 

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:16.780
 should not be a problem 

00:02:14.709 --> 00:02:18.730
 on the other hand, it will start a little 

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:20.290
 time afterwards to use an attack that 

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:22.120
 is called 10/100/1000 needle per year 

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:23.709
 that is 108 points of damage what 

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:25.569
 would like to say to a party trip 

00:02:23.709 --> 00:02:26.890
 and to interrupt it 

00:02:25.569 --> 00:02:28.150
 just to make him enough 

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:28.630
 points of damage until the 

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:30.550
 message 

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:33.310
 genii more to count his needles either 

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:35.620
 then writes past that it will pay 

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:37.630
 not that other time not soldiers who 

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:38.890
 are very simple to kill and she will do 

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:40.900
 propose at the same time not inform 

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:43.209
 champion then the latter undergoes their 

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:44.680
 always he is at skill five 

00:02:43.209 --> 00:02:46.959
 thousand needles but that is only 

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:50.440
 an hour or the floor by him that she 

00:02:46.959 --> 00:02:52.300
 is extremely simple to avoid and after 

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:54.010
 that he will be dead and contract between around 

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:56.410
 notes on the boss the very last 

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:58.300
 thing she will do will be to evoke so 

00:02:56.410 --> 00:03:01.120
 once again others had and especially 

00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:02.980
 a daddy guards you from the inra to her in 

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:04.840
 done to significantly reduce 

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:06.670
 damage she takes herself and so there is 

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:08.530
 will have more than to kill the guardian puppet 

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:10.030
 video then of the empress it will take 

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:12.579
 return to the Empress and finish her 

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:14.320
 and so it will be already at the end of this 

00:03:12.579 --> 00:03:16.420
 second bump and we're finally ready for 

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:17.730
 the third and the last boss of this 

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:20.170
 keep 

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:21.340
 so here we are against the third the 

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:23.829
 last boss of this dungeon 

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:25.870
 the assistant of the guardian then the 

00:03:23.829 --> 00:03:28.000
 main mechanics of this fight are 

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:30.400
 the mummies all around the area of 

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:31.900
 sarcophagus not prompt and mummies in 

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:32.500
 will go out they will run in the direction 

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:34.299
 opposite 

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:36.310
 so you have to be very careful 

00:03:34.299 --> 00:03:38.260
 because if ever we follow affected by 

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:40.460
 these words put there we get a stack of 

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:41.900
 oxen and shows 

00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:44.810
 I can not take off and have no 

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:47.180
 timer and if ever develops the 

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:49.460
 shows afterwards that we are actually going to 

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:50.960
 turn yourself into a mummy and run 

00:03:49.460 --> 00:03:52.550
 throughout the area and if 

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:54.800
 we never manage other members of the 

00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:56.920
 part in being unheard of he will win them 

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:58.790
 also a stack of oxen 

00:03:56.920 --> 00:04:02.120
 so that's about all for the 

00:03:58.790 --> 00:04:03.530
 first part of the fight from 50 

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:04.310
 % of life I think he's going 

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:06.440
 start using a new 

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:08.660
 attack called loot 

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:09.920
 fill in where he will target actually one of 

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:10.280
 players and will make a big year or in 

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:12.740
 line 

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:15.080
 so when you see that you just have to 

00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:16.700
 move to avoid the whey r I think 

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:18.350
 that art missing all very affected by 

00:04:16.700 --> 00:04:19.130
 this attack romania also a stadium 

00:04:18.350 --> 00:04:21.440
 of the debate 

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:23.810
 to turn us into a mummy and to 

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:25.910
 his very last attack he will 

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:27.170
 actually shoot a player loses him is this 

00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:28.040
 linked to him to conclude a link between 

00:04:27.170 --> 00:04:29.810
 he and the player 

00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:31.700
 and after which they will not start at him 

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:34.490
 give stadiums for the oxen 

00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:36.560
 but it will not stop either 

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:38.600
 when the player will be at 4 stack and this 

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:40.550
 will be really mummy or else we 

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:42.230
 can also stone the boss to break the 

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:43.880
 link that's all about it 

00:04:42.230 --> 00:04:45.080
 the mechanics that two gets bumped before 

00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:47.780
 there is not so much so still 

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:50.630
 once it's mostly to look where 

00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:51.680
 they put pop and avoid them 

00:04:50.630 --> 00:04:53.750
 so that's about all for 

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:54.620
 second way and for this video 

00:04:53.750 --> 00:04:56.300
 by the way so as usual 

00:04:54.620 --> 00:04:58.100
