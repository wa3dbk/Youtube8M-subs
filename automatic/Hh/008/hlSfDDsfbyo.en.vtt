00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.810
 firm 

00:00:04.340 --> 00:00:09.660
 Hello everyone, today's video wants 

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:11.220
 continue the theme of the endgame just today 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:12.420
 let's consider not eat without 

00:00:11.220 --> 00:00:14.790
 same-sex places by us 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:16.800
 and otherwise connected by devious elephants in 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:19.169
 which one of the parties will have 1 or 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:21.810
 even two extra pawns in this case 

00:00:19.169 --> 00:00:23.519
 I will see today those positions where I killed them 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:26.880
 there will be two extra pawns however far from 

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:28.980
 it will always give White victory 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:30.599
 Well in general, of course, we can say that the elves 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:32.940
 with contented moans usually 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:35.130
 ends in a nice draw 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:36.990
 pawns are almost always with 2 extra pawns 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:38.070
 anyway most of the lot 

00:00:36.990 --> 00:00:40.220
 ends in a draw 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:42.720
 all because it's quite difficult to find 

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:45.210
 turn off the sequels and the weakest 

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:46.800
 parties usually have very simple treatments 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:49.320
 rack by which proper 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:50.760
 saying she has not lost Well 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:53.670
 let's look at specific examples 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:55.260
 let's start from the position where whites move 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:57.870
 however, black is pretty easy to do. 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:01:00.329
 a draw and so white try to win no 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:03.060
 Beds 6 are attacking the elephant and 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:05.100
 White's further idea to move the d5 pawn 

00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:07.170
 since the pawn for 6 is blocked 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:09.390
 the king of blood stands on a black field and 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:11.340
 drive away the king who stands on black 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:14.010
 field course can never white and 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:17.460
 so shorter than 6 hours it is under you 

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:19.950
 battles go service 4 further whites go to 4 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:22.080
 since now the pawn on c6 was 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:25.409
 under the battle and the devil just wanted to pick her up 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:27.390
 but however further after servant 4 and just 

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:28.590
 black go king up to 8 and on blood 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:30.659
 all the elephant walks 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:33.930
 a3 principle host advance again is also quite 

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:36.780
 6 where possible lambo 4 was again 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:38.310
 can they stayed 5 move elephant up to 6 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:40.260
 White cannot do this position 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:42.630
 to strengthen the position that is black just 

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:44.490
 while the course is mainly along the a38 diagonal and 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:47.220
 wins gives a fairly easy draw 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:48.630
 that is, both black fields of course 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:51.180
 black holds pretty easily 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:53.510
 Japanese 7 and more than 7 therefore in this 

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:55.650
 of course there will be a draw 

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:57.630
 now let's see the next one 

00:01:55.650 --> 00:01:59.040
 an example where whites have two related 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:01:59.850
 pawns and they are quite far away 

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:02.040
 advanced 

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:04.080
 both are on the sixth row and in this 

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:06.299
 specific situation already whites win 

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:08.649
 and the win is also quite easy 

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:10.659
 started don't give step slam b5 

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:11.739
 Well, in the future it is very easy to spend 

00:02:10.659 --> 00:02:14.500
 queens pawn 

00:02:11.739 --> 00:02:16.360
 and slicer find king for over d8 

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:19.209
 when white just translates the king to 

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:21.099
 the field all this flow down korolev 5 black 

00:02:19.209 --> 00:02:23.409
 must stand still to be 

00:02:21.099 --> 00:02:26.500
 move 7 but then we walk king g6 

00:02:23.409 --> 00:02:29.260
 then the king and 7 and 7 and 8 wool then 

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:31.689
 it is very easy for white to win if 

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:34.120
 same starting positions instead of moving king 

00:02:31.689 --> 00:02:36.010
 up to 85 queens let it go too 

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:38.590
 whites are easy to win i mean they are now 

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:40.510
 lead the king not on more than 7 she poliste 

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:43.239
 well and prevent this plan black in any way 

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:45.459
 can not that is king up to 5 action 

00:02:43.239 --> 00:02:48.310
 must go on the field a3 otherwise follow 

00:02:45.459 --> 00:02:50.680
 there are 7 and further lies 6 especially 4 king 

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:53.519
 until 7 and the next move we play seven 

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:56.439
 and then e-8 firs here again 

00:02:53.519 --> 00:02:56.920
 Black has no defense against a pawn 

00:02:56.439 --> 00:02:59.670
 the queen 

00:02:56.920 --> 00:03:02.170
 in this position already white can win 

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:04.180
 Well , let's see the last most 

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:06.549
 probably a difficult and not obvious example 

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:08.769
 where whites have connected too 

00:03:06.549 --> 00:03:10.870
 passed pawns, however, no further 

00:03:08.769 --> 00:03:12.250
 than past positions and so here 

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:14.260
 black can still do 

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:16.329
 so bench I achieve pretty 

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:18.669
 non-standard and rather complicated way 

00:03:16.329 --> 00:03:21.280
 Black should only play with the first move 

00:03:18.669 --> 00:03:23.139
 slopes 8 such is a very obvious move 

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:25.900
 let's quickly say what here 

00:03:23.139 --> 00:03:28.989
 idea and so white while walking you through 4 

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:31.840
 black hail king up to 7 and black idea 

00:03:28.989 --> 00:03:33.909
 revealed brightest come 5 

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:36.430
 whites well it seems the most logical move then 

00:03:33.909 --> 00:03:38.620
 I would like to play then I am 6 then 

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:40.540
 king for 4 chest and 5 and so on in 

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:41.199
 this position if all this white 

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:43.419
 will achieve 

00:03:41.199 --> 00:03:45.220
 then white win easily however 

00:03:43.419 --> 00:03:47.650
 Black has a very strong move here 

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:48.159
 groans 7 after which immediately occurs 

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:50.650
 draw 

00:03:48.159 --> 00:03:52.810
 that is, itâ€™s just an elephant until 5 

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:54.699
 there is and the white king walks up to 4 it 

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:58.389
 blacks just stand still 

00:03:54.699 --> 00:04:00.280
 fields s7 and 8 and find 6 always 

00:03:58.389 --> 00:04:02.319
 black ready to play scrapping not 6 after 

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:04.419
 gives the king and 6 and as a result remains 

00:04:02.319 --> 00:04:07.350
 position where whites are king and elephant scientist 

00:04:04.419 --> 00:04:09.210
 the king is a draw like this here 

00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:11.730
 black easily achieves nobody's just 

00:04:09.210 --> 00:04:14.370
 stand with an elephant in the fields with the same 836 

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:15.960
 walks elephant is not 6 so less of course 

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:18.600
 white is not required to immediately walk and 

00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:20.700
 forward and if you go back on the course back then 

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:23.040
 in this position instead of income and 5 

00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:26.610
 Of course, the ideological and other course is so far 

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:28.710
 bring the king to the field to 4 so white 

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:30.870
 short ice 4 blacks walk from a ton to 7 

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:32.790
 It is obvious that if you collect and 5 then black 

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:34.650
 just keep on doing everything 

00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:37.320
 the same plan that is after 5 we walk with 

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:39.450
 better 8 and then just go through the fields in 

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:42.060
 seven or eight and prevent in any way 

00:04:39.450 --> 00:04:44.550
 Black has no protective sewer 

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:47.750
 White can therefore walk her five 

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:50.520
 District 5 is a trickier move and here 

00:04:47.750 --> 00:04:52.650
 too, it is important for black to go the strongest 

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:54.510
 the course here is even two possibilities 

00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:57.360
 make a draw is probably the easiest 

00:04:54.510 --> 00:04:59.850
 the way it is sit down the same 6 idea in that 

00:04:57.360 --> 00:05:01.710
 that we are now attached to pawns and 

00:04:59.850 --> 00:05:02.340
 4 i.e. the king cannot go for more 

00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:04.650
 6 

00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:06.900
 because of the loss of a pawn, if blood plays 

00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:09.510
 on the field at 4 then we can play 

00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:11.120
 even the elephant on the f7 field go back to 

00:05:09.510 --> 00:05:13.980
 original plan 

00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:15.480
 if white just stand still this 

00:05:13.980 --> 00:05:17.940
 black too can stand still with them 

00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:19.500
 there are always two fields and also 6-7 and 

00:05:17.940 --> 00:05:21.840
 accordingly, there is no white 

00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:24.540
 can make progress however except 

00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:26.550
 hodos same 6 in this position on the blood 

00:05:24.540 --> 00:05:28.410
 5 you can play and the king of e-8 

00:05:26.550 --> 00:05:30.480
 it's a more complicated way to make a draw 

00:05:28.410 --> 00:05:32.700
 but nevertheless also quite possible 

00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:35.100
 so king and guest now of course 

00:05:32.700 --> 00:05:37.320
 white brief roles in 6 is no longer autumn 

00:05:35.100 --> 00:05:39.840
 here strangely enough only this move 

00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:42.900
 gives black looking let's see 

00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:45.510
 why play the elephant h5 is bad so on 

00:05:42.900 --> 00:05:47.520
 the tail in our 5 will follow and 5 well now 

00:05:45.510 --> 00:05:51.000
 threatened by move i 6 then 

00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:52.740
 up to 6 to 7 black try to stop it 

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:55.350
 but they do not have time 

00:05:52.740 --> 00:05:57.300
 major 3 followed by d6 and here is a very 

00:05:55.350 --> 00:05:59.580
 it is important that blood is now black for 3 days 

00:05:57.300 --> 00:06:01.860
 field up to 7 bribe calculated to tell 7 

00:05:59.580 --> 00:06:04.410
 then we would play the elephant c4 and it would 

00:06:01.860 --> 00:06:06.240
 easy draw but however now it is in 

00:06:04.410 --> 00:06:07.919
 This position 100 already four to play 

00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:10.469
 too late under 

00:06:07.919 --> 00:06:13.020
 whites have a simple salutation 6 and protection against 

00:06:10.469 --> 00:06:16.620
 cold 7 and then advance pawn queens 

00:06:13.020 --> 00:06:18.870
 before the 8th queen, black has no 

00:06:16.620 --> 00:06:21.330
 maybe even them from the black king 

00:06:18.870 --> 00:06:24.150
 let's say black is beautiful our 3 we walk 

00:06:21.330 --> 00:06:26.639
 to 7 black agate king to 8 and he became 

00:06:24.150 --> 00:06:27.629
 again it is not even just a win 

00:06:26.639 --> 00:06:30.870
 immediately mate in 1 move 

00:06:27.629 --> 00:06:32.430
 and so in the position after entering to 

00:06:30.870 --> 00:06:35.009
 the role of lice if we can not play 5 

00:06:32.430 --> 00:06:38.669
 so we walk the same elephant 8 and again 

00:06:35.009 --> 00:06:40.500
 sleep attacks the d5 pawn 

00:06:38.669 --> 00:06:43.289
 play and ti5 due to loss of a pawn etc. 

00:06:40.500 --> 00:06:45.419
 so for now whites walk shorter than 7 

00:06:43.289 --> 00:06:48.270
 black again stand on the spot 

00:06:45.419 --> 00:06:50.580
 diagonals from your 80 he and everyone plays and 

00:06:48.270 --> 00:06:52.830
 sent on 3 right here already in this 

00:06:50.580 --> 00:06:55.680
 position when the king left with more of 6 

00:06:52.830 --> 00:06:57.900
 we can play the elephant h5 and so bill 

00:06:55.680 --> 00:06:59.219
 perform the same plan and 5 stone v3 

00:06:57.900 --> 00:07:01.529
 breathe in the same 4 

00:06:59.219 --> 00:07:03.810
 I am very important here that there is no ti6 care 

00:07:01.529 --> 00:07:06.060
 whites since at 6 surely follow 

00:07:03.810 --> 00:07:07.680
 words not 6 but she korolev 6 we play 

00:07:06.060 --> 00:07:09.629
 already king till 7 and we achieve 

00:07:07.680 --> 00:07:12.719
 elementary draw rack now 

00:07:09.629 --> 00:07:14.879
 we just play the elephant on the fields h3 same 4 

00:07:12.719 --> 00:07:17.490
 and 6 and here, of course, thereâ€™s no trouble 

00:07:14.879 --> 00:07:19.080
 can see the position but however again 

00:07:17.490 --> 00:07:21.509
 i will say that if we go back for a few 

00:07:19.080 --> 00:07:24.240
 moves back then after move 

00:07:21.509 --> 00:07:27.120
 and the king is our little black king to 4 

00:07:24.240 --> 00:07:29.099
 for white as if 70 blacks and a move circles 5 

00:07:27.120 --> 00:07:31.050
 White is probably the easiest and most 

00:07:29.099 --> 00:07:33.810
 quick way to do no strength and the host 

00:07:31.050 --> 00:07:35.460
 already 6 and here it is obvious that white is all 

00:07:33.810 --> 00:07:37.979
 still can not master the position 

00:07:35.460 --> 00:07:41.009
 this is why starting positions if we 

00:07:37.979 --> 00:07:43.439
 back only hudson and 8 here are the names 

00:07:41.009 --> 00:07:45.270
 only this way gives 

00:07:43.439 --> 00:07:46.830
 black looking for everything else to lose 

00:07:45.270 --> 00:07:49.349
 since the canvas seals 3 let's say 

00:07:46.830 --> 00:07:51.479
 Crawl will follow to 4 and further all the same 

00:07:49.349 --> 00:07:52.110
 with the right game, whites achieve 

00:07:51.479 --> 00:07:54.659
 victories 

00:07:52.110 --> 00:07:56.490
 Well, I hope that all these positions 

00:07:54.659 --> 00:07:58.500
 who were considering you today 

00:07:56.490 --> 00:08:00.689
 useful last of course bla pretty 

00:07:58.500 --> 00:08:02.849
 difficult but nevertheless all the same hope 

00:08:00.689 --> 00:08:05.639
 that you figured out why in this position 

00:08:02.849 --> 00:08:09.700
 black do draw well thank you all for 

00:08:05.639 --> 00:08:11.940
