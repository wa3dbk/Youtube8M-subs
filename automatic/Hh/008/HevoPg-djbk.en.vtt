00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:19.020 
created by before eruption data and it

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:22.550 
created by before eruption data and it
has<00:00:19.230> been<00:00:19.439> customized<00:00:20.330> let's<00:00:21.330> plot<00:00:21.600> 3d<00:00:22.109> color

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:22.560

map surface graphs for other stages of

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:29.000 
map surface graphs for other stages of
eruption<00:00:25.980> first<00:00:26.840> notice<00:00:27.840> the<00:00:27.869> axis<00:00:28.470> ranges

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:29.010 
eruption first notice the axis ranges

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:32.690 
eruption first notice the axis ranges
color<00:00:29.670> map<00:00:30.000> and<00:00:30.300> axis<00:00:31.140> plain<00:00:31.470> colors<00:00:31.949> are<00:00:32.219> look

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:32.700 
color map and axis plain colors are look

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:37.130 
color map and axis plain colors are look
different<00:00:33.180> from<00:00:33.360> graph<00:00:33.719> 1<00:00:35.420> let's<00:00:36.420> rename<00:00:36.809> the

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.140 
different from graph 1 let's rename the

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:41.780 
different from graph 1 let's rename the
last<00:00:37.380> graph<00:00:37.829> to<00:00:38.129> be<00:00:38.309> after<00:00:39.120> eruption<00:00:40.610> we<00:00:41.610> can

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:41.790 
last graph to be after eruption we can

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:44.540 
last graph to be after eruption we can
copy<00:00:42.059> the<00:00:42.600> format<00:00:43.020> of<00:00:43.050> graph<00:00:43.500> 1<00:00:43.800> and<00:00:44.070> paste<00:00:44.340> it

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
copy the format of graph 1 and paste it

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:46.729 
copy the format of graph 1 and paste it
to<00:00:44.700> other<00:00:44.910> graphs<00:00:45.390> so<00:00:45.870> they<00:00:46.020> all<00:00:46.200> have<00:00:46.469> similar

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:46.739 
to other graphs so they all have similar

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:50.330 
to other graphs so they all have similar
looks<00:00:47.570> so<00:00:48.570> with<00:00:48.750> graph<00:00:49.020> 1<00:00:49.260> active<00:00:49.800> which<00:00:50.100> was

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340 
looks so with graph 1 active which was

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:54.020 
looks so with graph 1 active which was
added<00:00:50.640> copy<00:00:51.180> format<00:00:51.690> all<00:00:51.989> and<00:00:52.670> then<00:00:53.670> we<00:00:53.850> can

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
added copy format all and then we can

00:00:54.030 --> 00:01:00.410 
added copy format all and then we can
activate<00:00:54.629> each<00:00:54.930> graph<00:00:55.320> and<00:00:55.620> paste<00:00:56.100> format<00:00:59.420> now

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
activate each graph and paste format now

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:10.910 
activate each graph and paste format now
they<00:01:00.719> all<00:01:00.899> have<00:01:01.140> similar<00:01:01.379> looks

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:15.590
