00:00:09.490 --> 00:00:09.500 
at making some hydrangeas now for this

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:11.799 
at making some hydrangeas now for this
we're<00:00:09.769> going<00:00:09.889> to<00:00:09.950> use<00:00:10.010> some<00:00:10.340> molds<00:00:10.879> another

00:00:11.799 --> 00:00:11.809 
we're going to use some molds another

00:00:11.809 --> 00:00:13.600 
we're going to use some molds another
usually<00:00:12.080> wherever<00:00:12.559> possible<00:00:12.799> I<00:00:13.160> try<00:00:13.190> not<00:00:13.549> to

00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:13.610 
usually wherever possible I try not to

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:16.420 
usually wherever possible I try not to
use<00:00:13.820> molds<00:00:14.360> and<00:00:14.870> if<00:00:15.440> I<00:00:15.559> can<00:00:15.679> help<00:00:15.830> it<00:00:16.099> but<00:00:16.219> for

00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:16.430 
use molds and if I can help it but for

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:19.390 
use molds and if I can help it but for
some<00:00:16.460> things<00:00:17.000> and<00:00:17.590> it's<00:00:18.590> so<00:00:18.680> difficult<00:00:18.950> to<00:00:19.220> do

00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:19.400 
some things and it's so difficult to do

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:21.279 
some things and it's so difficult to do
freehand<00:00:19.880> that<00:00:20.119> is<00:00:20.270> a<00:00:20.329> lot<00:00:20.570> easier<00:00:20.599> using<00:00:21.109> a

00:00:21.279 --> 00:00:21.289 
freehand that is a lot easier using a

00:00:21.289 --> 00:00:23.230 
freehand that is a lot easier using a
mold<00:00:21.470> so<00:00:21.619> will<00:00:22.310> never<00:00:22.430> go<00:00:22.609> with<00:00:22.789> these<00:00:22.970> ones

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:23.240 
mold so will never go with these ones

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:25.480 
mold so will never go with these ones
and<00:00:24.170> I've<00:00:24.410> got<00:00:24.560> two<00:00:24.710> different<00:00:25.010> sizes<00:00:25.189> I've

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:39.369 
nice molds to use so I'm going to use a
mix<00:00:37.760> of<00:00:37.879> normal<00:00:38.299> fondant<00:00:38.750> and<00:00:38.839> modeling<00:00:39.229> paste

00:00:39.369 --> 00:00:39.379 
mix of normal fondant and modeling paste

00:00:39.379 --> 00:00:41.350 
mix of normal fondant and modeling paste
so<00:00:39.589> you'll<00:00:39.710> see<00:00:39.920> my<00:00:40.309> normal<00:00:40.640> fondant<00:00:41.059> really

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:41.360 
so you'll see my normal fondant really

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:43.600 
so you'll see my normal fondant really
nice<00:00:41.540> and<00:00:41.750> soft<00:00:41.930> one<00:00:42.739> modeling<00:00:43.159> paste<00:00:43.339> is

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:43.610 
nice and soft one modeling paste is

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:46.479 
nice and soft one modeling paste is
quite<00:00:43.909> firm<00:00:44.750> so<00:00:45.710> I'm<00:00:45.920> just<00:00:46.100> going<00:00:46.280> to<00:00:46.309> knead

00:00:46.479 --> 00:00:46.489 
quite firm so I'm just going to knead

00:00:46.489 --> 00:00:47.619 
quite firm so I'm just going to knead
this<00:00:46.670> a<00:00:46.729> little<00:00:46.940> bit<00:00:47.119> and<00:00:47.210> I'm<00:00:47.299> going<00:00:47.420> to<00:00:47.449> mix

00:00:47.619 --> 00:00:47.629 
this a little bit and I'm going to mix

00:00:47.629 --> 00:00:53.079 
this a little bit and I'm going to mix
the<00:00:47.780> two<00:00:47.809> together<00:00:48.199> so<00:00:51.309> the<00:00:52.309> reason<00:00:52.670> we've

00:00:53.079 --> 00:00:53.089 
the two together so the reason we've

00:00:53.089 --> 00:00:56.079 
the two together so the reason we've
used<00:00:53.299> a<00:00:53.449> mix<00:00:53.659> of<00:00:53.809> birth<00:00:54.080> is<00:00:54.409> that<00:00:55.369> if<00:00:55.760> we<00:00:55.939> use

00:00:56.079 --> 00:00:56.089 
used a mix of birth is that if we use

00:00:56.089 --> 00:00:57.640 
used a mix of birth is that if we use
normal<00:00:56.479> fondant<00:00:56.869> on<00:00:56.960> its<00:00:57.140> own<00:00:57.290> and<00:00:57.439> when<00:00:57.530> the

00:00:57.640 --> 00:00:57.650 
normal fondant on its own and when the

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:59.829 
normal fondant on its own and when the
flowers<00:00:58.010> dry<00:00:58.309> they're<00:00:59.269> a<00:00:59.299> little<00:00:59.570> bit<00:00:59.659> more

00:00:59.829 --> 00:00:59.839 
flowers dry they're a little bit more

00:00:59.839 --> 00:01:01.990 
flowers dry they're a little bit more
fragile<00:01:00.080> if<00:01:00.650> you<00:01:00.949> put<00:01:01.220> a<00:01:01.250> little<00:01:01.760> bit<00:01:01.909> of

00:01:01.990 --> 00:01:02.000 
fragile if you put a little bit of

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.630 
fragile if you put a little bit of
modeling<00:01:02.269> paste<00:01:02.570> in<00:01:02.989> and<00:01:03.260> it<00:01:04.040> just<00:01:04.280> makes<00:01:04.430> them

00:01:04.630 --> 00:01:04.640 
modeling paste in and it just makes them

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:06.280 
modeling paste in and it just makes them
that<00:01:04.760> a<00:01:04.820> little<00:01:05.059> bit<00:01:05.180> tougher<00:01:05.750> so<00:01:05.960> the<00:01:06.080> less

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:06.290 
that a little bit tougher so the less

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:08.230 
that a little bit tougher so the less
likely<00:01:07.010> to<00:01:07.250> snap<00:01:07.460> and<00:01:07.700> brick<00:01:07.909> when<00:01:08.119> you're

00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:08.240 
likely to snap and brick when you're

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:12.340 
likely to snap and brick when you're
adding<00:01:08.390> them<00:01:08.600> to<00:01:08.780> a<00:01:08.810> cake<00:01:10.060> so<00:01:11.140> what<00:01:12.140> I'm<00:01:12.200> going

roll<00:01:44.210> it<00:01:44.240> out<00:01:44.450> quite<00:01:44.749> thin<00:01:45.079> so<00:01:45.619> if<00:01:46.310> you<00:01:46.490> have<00:01:46.609> a

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:46.640 
roll it out quite thin so if you have a

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:48.010 
roll it out quite thin so if you have a
pasta<00:01:47.090> maker<00:01:47.240> and<00:01:47.479> you<00:01:47.539> want<00:01:47.689> to<00:01:47.810> run<00:01:47.929> it

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:48.020 
pasta maker and you want to run it

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:49.599 
pasta maker and you want to run it
through<00:01:48.049> the<00:01:48.200> pasta<00:01:48.590> maker<00:01:48.710> that's<00:01:49.039> fine<00:01:49.340> and

00:01:49.599 --> 00:01:49.609 
through the pasta maker that's fine and

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:51.789 
through the pasta maker that's fine and
I<00:01:50.359> don't<00:01:50.600> have<00:01:50.689> a<00:01:50.749> pasta<00:01:51.079> maker<00:01:51.200> so<00:01:51.499> I'll<00:01:51.590> just

00:01:51.789 --> 00:01:51.799 
I don't have a pasta maker so I'll just

00:01:51.799 --> 00:01:54.069 
I don't have a pasta maker so I'll just
roll<00:01:51.979> with<00:01:52.159> my<00:01:52.310> hand<00:01:52.549> with<00:01:53.179> my<00:01:53.359> board's<00:01:53.689> moving

00:01:54.069 --> 00:01:54.079 
roll with my hand with my board's moving

00:01:54.079 --> 00:02:02.660 
roll with my hand with my board's moving
around<00:01:58.299> so<00:01:59.299> for<00:01:59.509> thickness

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:02.670 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:04.610 

you're<00:02:03.420> going<00:02:03.570> to<00:02:03.630> roll<00:02:03.810> it<00:02:04.020> so<00:02:04.260> the<00:02:04.409> same

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:04.620 
you're going to roll it so the same

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:06.200 
you're going to roll it so the same
thickness<00:02:04.920> is<00:02:05.220> the<00:02:05.340> little<00:02:05.580> lip<00:02:05.790> that's<00:02:06.060> on

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:06.210 
thickness is the little lip that's on

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:09.620 
thickness is the little lip that's on
the<00:02:06.360> side<00:02:06.570> so<00:02:07.380> if<00:02:07.770> you<00:02:07.830> hold<00:02:08.310> your<00:02:08.610> fondant<00:02:09.270> on

00:02:09.620 --> 00:02:09.630 
the side so if you hold your fondant on

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:11.720 
the side so if you hold your fondant on
the<00:02:10.229> edge<00:02:10.319> of<00:02:10.410> the<00:02:10.500> mold<00:02:10.649> against<00:02:11.250> the<00:02:11.520> edge<00:02:11.640> of

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:11.730 
the edge of the mold against the edge of

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:13.940 
the edge of the mold against the edge of
the<00:02:11.850> flower<00:02:12.060> you'll<00:02:12.810> be<00:02:12.930> able<00:02:13.020> to<00:02:13.260> see<00:02:13.470> if<00:02:13.740> it's

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:13.950 
the flower you'll be able to see if it's

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:18.470 
the flower you'll be able to see if it's
a<00:02:14.040> little<00:02:14.190> bit<00:02:14.400> thicker<00:02:15.830> then<00:02:16.830> the<00:02:17.069> lip<00:02:17.310> or<00:02:18.240> not

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:18.480 
a little bit thicker then the lip or not

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:20.480 
a little bit thicker then the lip or not
so<00:02:18.780> mine's<00:02:19.020> a<00:02:19.170> bit<00:02:19.350> thick<00:02:19.590> still<00:02:19.950> someone<00:02:20.250> keep

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:20.490 
so mine's a bit thick still someone keep

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:24.890 
so mine's a bit thick still someone keep
rolling<00:02:22.760> so<00:02:23.760> I'm<00:02:23.880> just<00:02:24.030> cutting<00:02:24.209> it<00:02:24.420> down<00:02:24.450> a

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:24.900 
rolling so I'm just cutting it down a

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:27.890 
rolling so I'm just cutting it down a
little<00:02:25.890> bit<00:02:26.040> as<00:02:26.190> it's<00:02:26.340> quite<00:02:26.580> big<00:02:26.820> bigger<00:02:27.810> than

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:27.900 
little bit as it's quite big bigger than

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:31.940 
little bit as it's quite big bigger than
the<00:02:28.110> mold<00:02:29.450> okay<00:02:30.480> and<00:02:31.230> what<00:02:31.380> we<00:02:31.440> want<00:02:31.590> to<00:02:31.620> do<00:02:31.770> is

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:31.950 
the mold okay and what we want to do is

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:34.510 
the mold okay and what we want to do is
just<00:02:32.100> light<00:02:32.310> it<00:02:32.340> over<00:02:32.580> the<00:02:32.670> top<00:02:32.850> of<00:02:32.880> my<00:02:33.239> mold

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:34.520 
just light it over the top of my mold

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:36.680 
just light it over the top of my mold
I'm<00:02:35.520> just<00:02:35.790> going<00:02:35.940> to<00:02:36.000> push<00:02:36.150> it<00:02:36.180> in<00:02:36.360> a<00:02:36.450> little

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:36.690 
I'm just going to push it in a little

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:38.270 
I'm just going to push it in a little
bit<00:02:36.780> and<00:02:37.050> what<00:02:37.320> I<00:02:37.350> find<00:02:37.620> sometimes<00:02:37.830> it's

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:38.280 
bit and what I find sometimes it's

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:41.780 
bit and what I find sometimes it's
easier<00:02:38.610> to<00:02:38.790> use<00:02:38.820> a<00:02:39.320> look<00:02:40.320> on<00:02:40.620> our<00:02:40.920> poop<00:02:41.250> to<00:02:41.580> push

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:41.790 
easier to use a look on our poop to push

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:44.900 
easier to use a look on our poop to push
it<00:02:41.970> in<00:02:42.120> with<00:02:42.150> and<00:02:42.720> you'll<00:02:42.989> see<00:02:43.550> you<00:02:44.550> can<00:02:44.700> see

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:44.910 
it in with and you'll see you can see

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:50.810 
it in with and you'll see you can see
through<00:02:45.269> now<00:02:46.340> where<00:02:47.340> the<00:02:47.519> hydrangeas<00:02:48.209> are<00:02:49.820> so

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:50.820 
through now where the hydrangeas are so

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:55.130 
through now where the hydrangeas are so
I'm<00:02:50.970> just<00:02:51.120> going<00:02:51.269> to<00:02:51.390> rub<00:02:51.510> that<00:02:51.540> in<00:02:52.519> now<00:02:54.140> I'm

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:55.140 
I'm just going to rub that in now I'm

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:57.860 
I'm just going to rub that in now I'm
going<00:02:55.350> to<00:02:55.410> take<00:02:55.590> the<00:02:55.739> rolling<00:02:56.070> pin<00:02:56.690> and<00:02:57.690> we're

00:02:57.860 --> 00:02:57.870 
going to take the rolling pin and we're

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:00.170 
going to take the rolling pin and we're
going<00:02:57.989> to<00:02:58.019> lightly<00:02:58.260> roll<00:02:59.030> backwards<00:03:00.030> and

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:00.180 
going to lightly roll backwards and

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:01.940 
going to lightly roll backwards and
forwards<00:03:00.600> just<00:03:00.810> slightly<00:03:01.140> rocking<00:03:01.769> the

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:01.950 
forwards just slightly rocking the

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:05.660 
forwards just slightly rocking the
rolling<00:03:02.400> pin<00:03:02.550> backwards<00:03:02.910> and<00:03:03.060> forwards<00:03:04.670> over

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:05.670 
rolling pin backwards and forwards over

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:08.620 
rolling pin backwards and forwards over
the<00:03:05.940> cutter<00:03:06.150> now<00:03:07.140> if<00:03:07.380> you<00:03:07.500> do<00:03:07.620> it<00:03:07.680> really<00:03:07.950> hard

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:08.630 
the cutter now if you do it really hard

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:12.110 
the cutter now if you do it really hard
it<00:03:09.630> knocks<00:03:10.040> your<00:03:11.040> icing<00:03:11.400> out<00:03:11.519> of<00:03:11.640> place<00:03:11.880> and

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:12.120 
it knocks your icing out of place and

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:13.310 
it knocks your icing out of place and
you'll<00:03:12.209> end<00:03:12.329> up<00:03:12.390> with<00:03:12.540> like<00:03:12.660> double<00:03:13.019> lines

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:13.320 
you'll end up with like double lines

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:15.380 
you'll end up with like double lines
underneath<00:03:14.040> of<00:03:14.340> where<00:03:14.519> the<00:03:14.640> hydrangeas<00:03:15.239> are

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:15.390 
underneath of where the hydrangeas are

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:18.140 
underneath of where the hydrangeas are
so<00:03:16.200> just<00:03:16.440> keep<00:03:16.650> any<00:03:16.890> quite<00:03:17.130> light<00:03:17.400> you're

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:18.150 
so just keep any quite light you're

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:19.699 
so just keep any quite light you're
going<00:03:18.299> to<00:03:18.360> do<00:03:18.510> it<00:03:18.630> until<00:03:18.840> the<00:03:18.959> green<00:03:19.230> starts

00:03:19.699 --> 00:03:19.709 
going to do it until the green starts

00:03:19.709 --> 00:03:21.800 
going to do it until the green starts
coming<00:03:20.040> through<00:03:20.250> so<00:03:20.549> if<00:03:20.820> you<00:03:21.209> can<00:03:21.360> see<00:03:21.570> here

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:21.810 
coming through so if you can see here

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:23.300 
coming through so if you can see here
the<00:03:21.959> greens<00:03:22.230> starting<00:03:22.709> to<00:03:22.769> come<00:03:22.950> through

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:23.310 
the greens starting to come through

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:29.270 
the greens starting to come through
which<00:03:24.030> is<00:03:24.209> what<00:03:24.239> we<00:03:24.510> want<00:03:27.739> so<00:03:28.739> I'll<00:03:28.890> just<00:03:29.040> keep

00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:29.280 
which is what we want so I'll just keep

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:34.070 
which is what we want so I'll just keep
him<00:03:29.489> working<00:03:29.880> at<00:03:30.030> it

00:03:34.070 --> 00:03:34.080 

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:35.810 

the<00:03:34.620> first<00:03:34.860> couple<00:03:35.130> of<00:03:35.160> times<00:03:35.250> I<00:03:35.490> didn't<00:03:35.700> press

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:35.820 
the first couple of times I didn't press

00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:38.810 
the first couple of times I didn't press
on<00:03:36.030> way<00:03:36.300> too<00:03:36.360> hard<00:03:37.040> and<00:03:38.040> it<00:03:38.130> just<00:03:38.160> stretched<00:03:38.580> my

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:38.820 
on way too hard and it just stretched my

00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:43.040 
on way too hard and it just stretched my
ice<00:03:38.970> in<00:03:39.620> out<00:03:40.620> of<00:03:40.860> the<00:03:40.890> hydrangea<00:03:41.850> bits<00:03:42.270> and<00:03:42.510> it

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:43.050 
ice in out of the hydrangea bits and it

00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:45.020 
ice in out of the hydrangea bits and it
tall<00:03:43.440> rather<00:03:43.710> than<00:03:44.010> coming<00:03:44.220> out<00:03:44.400> properly<00:03:44.880> so

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:45.030 
tall rather than coming out properly so

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:47.390 
tall rather than coming out properly so
you<00:03:45.090> do<00:03:45.240> need<00:03:45.390> to<00:03:45.450> make<00:03:45.720> sure<00:03:46.100> it's<00:03:47.100> going

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:47.400 
you do need to make sure it's going

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:52.780 
you do need to make sure it's going
through<00:03:47.670> properly<00:03:48.090> into<00:03:48.720> anything<00:03:48.930> there<00:03:49.170> too

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:52.790 

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:55.130

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:56.770 
so you'll see it's coming away a little
bit<00:03:55.230> I<00:03:55.350> so<00:03:55.530> I'm<00:03:55.590> just<00:03:55.740> gonna<00:03:55.830> pull<00:03:56.070> it<00:03:56.190> away

00:03:56.770 --> 00:03:56.780 
bit I so I'm just gonna pull it away

00:03:56.780 --> 00:04:06.200 
bit I so I'm just gonna pull it away
from<00:03:57.780> my<00:03:57.960> mold<00:03:58.200> just<00:04:04.880> keeping<00:04:05.880> hold<00:04:06.030> of<00:04:06.120> the

00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:06.210 
from my mold just keeping hold of the

00:04:06.210 --> 00:04:07.340 
from my mold just keeping hold of the
flowers<00:04:06.510> just<00:04:06.540> to<00:04:06.750> make<00:04:06.900> sure<00:04:06.930> they<00:04:07.200> don't

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:07.350 
flowers just to make sure they don't

00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:15.200 
flowers just to make sure they don't
pull<00:04:07.880> with<00:04:08.880> the<00:04:09.030> edge<00:04:09.120> in<00:04:09.420> bit<00:04:13.970> and<00:04:14.970> the<00:04:15.060> good

00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:15.210 
pull with the edge in bit and the good

00:04:15.210 --> 00:04:16.760 
pull with the edge in bit and the good
thing<00:04:15.420> about<00:04:15.510> the<00:04:15.780> molds<00:04:16.200> rather<00:04:16.440> than<00:04:16.560> using

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:16.770 
thing about the molds rather than using

00:04:16.770 --> 00:04:19.310 
thing about the molds rather than using
the<00:04:16.890> individual<00:04:17.520> cutter<00:04:17.790> is<00:04:18.060> that<00:04:18.320> obviously

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:19.320 
the individual cutter is that obviously

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:22.340 
the individual cutter is that obviously
you<00:04:19.500> can<00:04:19.709> get<00:04:19.890> a<00:04:19.950> few<00:04:20.870> hydrangeas<00:04:21.870> done<00:04:22.080> at<00:04:22.200> the

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:22.350 
you can get a few hydrangeas done at the

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:29.060 
you can get a few hydrangeas done at the
same<00:04:22.530> time<00:04:27.410> and<00:04:28.410> these<00:04:28.590> are<00:04:28.740> a<00:04:28.770> little<00:04:28.920> bit

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:29.070 
same time and these are a little bit

00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:30.290 
same time and these are a little bit
bigger<00:04:29.250> than<00:04:29.430> the<00:04:29.550> cultures<00:04:29.880> I've<00:04:30.030> got<00:04:30.180> as

00:04:30.290 --> 00:04:30.300 
bigger than the cultures I've got as

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:37.330 
bigger than the cultures I've got as
well<00:04:30.450> which<00:04:30.660> is<00:04:30.690> nice

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:37.340 

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:39.160 

and<00:04:37.970> if<00:04:38.060> you're<00:04:38.150> not<00:04:38.270> particularly<00:04:38.690> artistic

00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:39.170 
and if you're not particularly artistic

00:04:39.170 --> 00:04:41.050 
and if you're not particularly artistic
and<00:04:39.530> good<00:04:39.650> at<00:04:39.770> modeling<00:04:40.100> and<00:04:40.280> things<00:04:40.520> you'll

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:41.060 
and good at modeling and things you'll

00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:42.340 
and good at modeling and things you'll
find<00:04:41.090> these<00:04:41.390> are<00:04:41.570> quite<00:04:41.720> good<00:04:41.870> to<00:04:42.050> use<00:04:42.200> because

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:42.350 
find these are quite good to use because

00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:44.560 
find these are quite good to use because
obviously<00:04:42.560> they<00:04:43.550> come<00:04:43.730> out<00:04:43.850> right<00:04:44.090> for<00:04:44.390> you
