like that move out of the slider onto
the<00:01:46.649> image<00:01:46.829> and<00:01:47.189> as<00:01:47.310> you<00:01:47.490> can<00:01:47.640> see<00:01:47.670> i<00:01:47.850> can<00:01:48.030> now

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
the image and as you can see i can now

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:50.840 
the image and as you can see i can now
slide<00:01:48.750> on<00:01:49.079> top<00:01:49.320> of<00:01:49.470> the<00:01:49.560> image<00:01:49.770> to<00:01:50.100> control<00:01:50.610> the

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:50.850 
slide on top of the image to control the

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:53.660 
slide on top of the image to control the
slider<00:01:51.329> which<00:01:52.140> is<00:01:52.290> making<00:01:52.470> it<00:01:52.740> easier<00:01:52.920> for<00:01:53.369> me

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670 
slider which is making it easier for me

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:56.870 
slider which is making it easier for me
to<00:01:53.850> do<00:01:54.540> and<00:01:55.100> then<00:01:56.100> we<00:01:56.219> are<00:01:56.310> going<00:01:56.430> to<00:01:56.520> look<00:01:56.670> at

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:56.880 
to do and then we are going to look at

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:58.700 
to do and then we are going to look at
one<00:01:57.180> of<00:01:57.210> the<00:01:57.479> latest<00:01:57.719> additions<00:01:58.350> to<00:01:58.439> the

00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:58.710 
one of the latest additions to the

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:00.830 
one of the latest additions to the
editing<00:01:59.159> functions<00:01:59.610> here<00:01:59.729> and<00:02:00.030> that's<00:02:00.600> called

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:00.840 
editing functions here and that's called

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:03.950 
editing functions here and that's called
gradient<00:02:01.560> filters<00:02:02.189> now<00:02:02.729> this<00:02:02.909> is<00:02:03.090> a<00:02:03.119> very<00:02:03.659> cool

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:03.960 
gradient filters now this is a very cool

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:05.749 
gradient filters now this is a very cool
feature<00:02:04.020> you<00:02:04.860> can<00:02:05.040> use<00:02:05.250> this<00:02:05.430> for<00:02:05.610> your

00:02:05.749 --> 00:02:05.759 
feature you can use this for your

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:08.600 
feature you can use this for your
landscapes<00:02:06.540> and<00:02:06.979> for<00:02:07.979> instance<00:02:08.069> image<00:02:08.399> like

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:08.610 
landscapes and for instance image like

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:11.240 
landscapes and for instance image like
this<00:02:08.640> which<00:02:09.450> maybe<00:02:10.050> want<00:02:10.319> to<00:02:10.590> bring<00:02:10.830> back<00:02:11.009> some

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:11.250 
this which maybe want to bring back some

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:13.700 
this which maybe want to bring back some
of<00:02:11.310> the<00:02:11.370> sky<00:02:11.849> so<00:02:12.569> I'm<00:02:12.629> just<00:02:12.810> going<00:02:12.989> to

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:13.710 
of the sky so I'm just going to

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:15.470 
of the sky so I'm just going to
select<00:02:14.190> the<00:02:14.310> plus<00:02:14.520> right<00:02:14.880> here<00:02:15.090> it's<00:02:15.210> going<00:02:15.360> to

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:15.480 
select the plus right here it's going to

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:17.150 
select the plus right here it's going to
give<00:02:15.630> me<00:02:15.810> a<00:02:15.990> gradient<00:02:16.440> and<00:02:16.590> it<00:02:16.650> says<00:02:16.830> put<00:02:17.010> your

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:17.160 
give me a gradient and it says put your

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:19.100 
give me a gradient and it says put your
finger<00:02:17.430> down<00:02:17.580> on<00:02:17.640> the<00:02:17.910> start<00:02:18.240> point<00:02:18.450> and<00:02:18.630> drag

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:19.110 
finger down on the start point and drag

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:21.530 
finger down on the start point and drag
to<00:02:19.290> the<00:02:19.350> end<00:02:19.680> point<00:02:19.800> so<00:02:20.580> I<00:02:20.610> can<00:02:20.880> start<00:02:21.210> there

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:21.540 
to the end point so I can start there

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:25.970 
to the end point so I can start there
and<00:02:21.750> then<00:02:21.840> I<00:02:22.770> just<00:02:23.760> dragged<00:02:24.300> to<00:02:24.690> the<00:02:24.720> end<00:02:25.020> now

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:25.980 
and then I just dragged to the end now

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:28.430 
and then I just dragged to the end now
when<00:02:26.760> once<00:02:27.180> you've<00:02:27.360> selected<00:02:27.630> your<00:02:27.960> gradient

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:28.440 
when once you've selected your gradient

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:30.830 
when once you've selected your gradient
you'll<00:02:29.010> notice<00:02:29.430> it's<00:02:29.610> opening<00:02:30.060> up<00:02:30.270> here<00:02:30.630> all

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:30.840 
you'll notice it's opening up here all

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:33.380 
you'll notice it's opening up here all
the<00:02:31.470> settings<00:02:31.860> I<00:02:32.100> can<00:02:32.370> use<00:02:32.580> it's<00:02:32.820> even<00:02:33.180> got<00:02:33.330> its

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:33.390 
the settings I can use it's even got its

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:35.660 
the settings I can use it's even got its
own<00:02:33.660> curves<00:02:34.110> built<00:02:34.380> in<00:02:34.620> so<00:02:34.860> this<00:02:35.010> is<00:02:35.040> awesome<00:02:35.520> I

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:35.670 
own curves built in so this is awesome I

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:38.930 
own curves built in so this is awesome I
can<00:02:36.270> now<00:02:36.360> under<00:02:36.720> expose<00:02:37.140> the<00:02:37.410> sky<00:02:37.920> and<00:02:38.250> you're

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:38.940 
can now under expose the sky and you're

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:40.160 
can now under expose the sky and you're
going<00:02:39.090> to<00:02:39.150> see<00:02:39.420> i'm<00:02:39.690> bringing<00:02:40.140> back

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:40.170 
going to see i'm bringing back

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:44.150 
going to see i'm bringing back
information<00:02:41.070> in<00:02:41.730> the<00:02:42.270> sky<00:02:42.510> section<00:02:43.020> i<00:02:43.170> can<00:02:43.980> go

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:44.160 
information in the sky section i can go

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:47.090 
information in the sky section i can go
to<00:02:44.220> curves<00:02:44.610> as<00:02:44.880> well<00:02:45.120> and<00:02:45.800> curves<00:02:46.800> has<00:02:46.950> got<00:02:47.070> a

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:47.100 
to curves as well and curves has got a

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:48.830 
to curves as well and curves has got a
very<00:02:47.310> cool<00:02:47.580> overlay<00:02:48.060> year<00:02:48.300> just<00:02:48.570> like<00:02:48.630> the

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:48.840 
very cool overlay year just like the

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:51.050 
very cool overlay year just like the
previous<00:02:49.020> version<00:02:49.410> of<00:02:49.650> photo<00:02:49.890> mate<00:02:50.100> and<00:02:50.340> then

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:51.060 
previous version of photo mate and then

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:54.170 
previous version of photo mate and then
i<00:02:51.240> can<00:02:51.720> for<00:02:52.260> instance<00:02:52.380> control<00:02:53.310> the<00:02:53.520> contrast

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:54.180 
i can for instance control the contrast

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:57.500 
i can for instance control the contrast
of<00:02:54.360> the<00:02:54.600> sky<00:02:55.220> within<00:02:56.220> only<00:02:56.580> that<00:02:56.970> section<00:02:57.420> that

00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:57.510 
of the sky within only that section that

00:02:57.510 --> 00:02:59.270 
of the sky within only that section that
we've<00:02:57.690> selected<00:02:57.870> you<00:02:58.320> can<00:02:58.350> even<00:02:58.680> go<00:02:58.830> to<00:02:59.040> the

00:02:59.270 --> 00:02:59.280 
we've selected you can even go to the

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:01.880 
we've selected you can even go to the
blue<00:02:59.580> channel<00:02:59.880> year<00:03:00.360> and<00:03:00.600> you<00:03:01.140> can<00:03:01.320> even<00:03:01.530> add

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:01.890 
blue channel year and you can even add

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:04.130 
blue channel year and you can even add
more<00:03:02.610> blue<00:03:03.000> if<00:03:03.300> you<00:03:03.330> want<00:03:03.600> its<00:03:03.810> make<00:03:03.990> it<00:03:04.110> a

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:04.140 
more blue if you want its make it a

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:05.750 
more blue if you want its make it a
little<00:03:04.290> bit<00:03:04.440> unnatural<00:03:04.740> now<00:03:05.160> but<00:03:05.400> as<00:03:05.520> you<00:03:05.640> can

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:05.760 
little bit unnatural now but as you can

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:08.150 
little bit unnatural now but as you can
see<00:03:05.970> that's<00:03:06.180> also<00:03:06.570> possible<00:03:06.810> and<00:03:07.740> i<00:03:07.800> can<00:03:07.980> just

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:08.160 
see that's also possible and i can just

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:11.240 
see that's also possible and i can just
click<00:03:08.460> on<00:03:08.580> the<00:03:08.850> curves<00:03:09.300> to<00:03:09.600> take<00:03:09.810> that<00:03:10.080> away<00:03:10.260> so

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:11.250 
click on the curves to take that away so

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:14.840 
click on the curves to take that away so
that's<00:03:11.520> the<00:03:12.710> gradient<00:03:13.710> fault<00:03:13.950> and<00:03:14.190> is<00:03:14.370> a<00:03:14.550> bunch

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:14.850 
that's the gradient fault and is a bunch

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:16.370 
that's the gradient fault and is a bunch
of<00:03:15.000> more<00:03:15.180> options<00:03:15.570> in<00:03:15.750> yet<00:03:15.930> but<00:03:16.050> that's<00:03:16.200> just<00:03:16.260> a

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:16.380 
of more options in yet but that's just a

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:18.200 
of more options in yet but that's just a
quick<00:03:16.500> look<00:03:16.770> at<00:03:16.890> it<00:03:17.040> i'm<00:03:17.640> going<00:03:17.820> to<00:03:17.940> close<00:03:18.150> this

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:18.210 
quick look at it i'm going to close this

00:03:18.210 --> 00:03:20.900 
quick look at it i'm going to close this
section<00:03:18.660> the<00:03:19.560> next<00:03:19.830> one<00:03:19.980> is<00:03:20.100> the<00:03:20.130> circular

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:20.910 
section the next one is the circular

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:22.910 
section the next one is the circular
filters<00:03:21.360> i'm<00:03:21.600> going<00:03:21.810> to<00:03:21.900> zoom<00:03:21.930> close<00:03:22.500> on<00:03:22.770> this

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:22.920 
filters i'm going to zoom close on this

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:24.830 
filters i'm going to zoom close on this
image<00:03:23.310> to<00:03:23.790> get<00:03:23.970> to<00:03:24.120> that<00:03:24.240> section<00:03:24.540> where<00:03:24.810> the

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:24.840 
image to get to that section where the

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:26.780 
image to get to that section where the
balloon<00:03:25.230> is<00:03:25.530> i'm<00:03:25.980> going<00:03:26.190> to<00:03:26.250> open<00:03:26.370> up<00:03:26.670> the

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:26.790 
balloon is i'm going to open up the

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:29.900 
balloon is i'm going to open up the
circular<00:03:27.270> filter<00:03:27.720> add<00:03:27.990> a<00:03:28.020> filter<00:03:28.860> and<00:03:29.280> then

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:29.910 
circular filter add a filter and then

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:31.880 
circular filter add a filter and then
you<00:03:30.210> work<00:03:30.570> it<00:03:30.720> like<00:03:30.870> a<00:03:30.930> square<00:03:31.440> so<00:03:31.650> I'm<00:03:31.710> going

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:31.890 
you work it like a square so I'm going

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:34.040 
you work it like a square so I'm going
to<00:03:31.920> start<00:03:32.250> from<00:03:32.490> the<00:03:32.640> corner<00:03:33.150> there<00:03:33.360> and<00:03:33.510> drag

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:34.050 
to start from the corner there and drag

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:38.090 
to start from the corner there and drag
the<00:03:34.890> circle<00:03:35.460> and<00:03:35.670> then<00:03:36.180> when<00:03:36.360> I'm<00:03:36.450> done<00:03:37.100> you

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:38.100 
the circle and then when I'm done you

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:40.160 
the circle and then when I'm done you
will<00:03:38.160> see<00:03:38.520> I've<00:03:38.760> got<00:03:38.790> another<00:03:39.450> option<00:03:39.930> year

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:40.170 
will see I've got another option year

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:42.500 
will see I've got another option year
with<00:03:40.350> options<00:03:41.070> I<00:03:41.190> can<00:03:41.220> use<00:03:41.670> there's<00:03:42.240> also

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:42.510 
with options I can use there's also

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:44.840 
with options I can use there's also
sighs<00:03:43.080> now<00:03:43.440> you'll<00:03:43.590> notice<00:03:43.800> my<00:03:44.070> drag<00:03:44.400> the<00:03:44.610> size

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:44.850 
sighs now you'll notice my drag the size

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:47.180 
sighs now you'll notice my drag the size
i<00:03:45.180> can<00:03:45.540> change<00:03:45.870> the<00:03:46.140> size<00:03:46.380> of<00:03:46.740> the<00:03:46.890> circle

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:47.190 
i can change the size of the circle

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:50.180 
i can change the size of the circle
graph<00:03:47.580> drawn<00:03:47.970> there<00:03:48.270> I'm<00:03:48.750> a<00:03:48.810> little<00:03:48.960> bit<00:03:49.470> sku

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:50.190 
graph drawn there I'm a little bit sku

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:51.650 
graph drawn there I'm a little bit sku
of<00:03:50.310> the<00:03:50.430> circle<00:03:50.790> but<00:03:50.940> i'm<00:03:51.030> looking<00:03:51.360> at<00:03:51.480> my

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:51.660 
of the circle but i'm looking at my

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:53.780 
of the circle but i'm looking at my
tablet<00:03:52.140> from<00:03:52.290> an<00:03:52.440> angle<00:03:52.800> so<00:03:53.310> it<00:03:53.370> was<00:03:53.550> a<00:03:53.580> bit

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:53.790 
tablet from an angle so it was a bit

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:56.750 
tablet from an angle so it was a bit
tricky<00:03:53.970> to<00:03:54.150> draw<00:03:54.510> the<00:03:54.570> circle<00:03:55.110> now<00:03:55.290> i<00:03:55.950> can<00:03:56.550> find

00:03:56.750 --> 00:03:56.760 
tricky to draw the circle now i can find

00:03:56.760 --> 00:03:58.550 
tricky to draw the circle now i can find
just<00:03:56.880> go<00:03:57.060> to<00:03:57.210> exposure<00:03:57.660> and<00:03:57.960> i<00:03:58.050> can<00:03:58.230> control

00:03:58.550 --> 00:03:58.560 
just go to exposure and i can control

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:01.190 
just go to exposure and i can control
only<00:03:59.340> the<00:03:59.490> exposure<00:03:59.970> in<00:04:00.240> that<00:04:00.480> section<00:04:00.840> where

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:01.200 
only the exposure in that section where

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:04.490 
only the exposure in that section where
I<00:04:01.230> draw<00:04:01.590> the<00:04:01.620> circle<00:04:02.280> and<00:04:02.510> then<00:04:03.510> also<00:04:03.870> I've<00:04:04.440> got

00:04:04.490 --> 00:04:04.500 
I draw the circle and then also I've got

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:07.730 
I draw the circle and then also I've got
again<00:04:05.280> a<00:04:05.520> curves<00:04:05.910> function<00:04:06.360> so<00:04:07.050> i<00:04:07.080> can<00:04:07.410> now<00:04:07.530> go

00:04:07.730 --> 00:04:07.740 
again a curves function so i can now go

00:04:07.740 --> 00:04:10.640 
again a curves function so i can now go
yet<00:04:08.070> and<00:04:08.250> control<00:04:08.640> the<00:04:08.790> curves<00:04:09.060> for<00:04:09.390> this<00:04:09.600> or<00:04:09.810> i

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:10.650 
yet and control the curves for this or i

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:13.070 
yet and control the curves for this or i
can<00:04:10.710> go<00:04:11.160> to<00:04:11.220> maybe<00:04:11.640> say<00:04:12.060> the<00:04:12.090> blue<00:04:12.480> channel<00:04:12.780> and

00:04:13.070 --> 00:04:13.080 
can go to maybe say the blue channel and

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:16.250 
can go to maybe say the blue channel and
add<00:04:13.230> some<00:04:13.680> yellow<00:04:13.740> if<00:04:14.460> I<00:04:14.580> wanted<00:04:14.970> to<00:04:15.030> and<00:04:15.390> then

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:16.260 
add some yellow if I wanted to and then

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:18.800 
add some yellow if I wanted to and then
I<00:04:16.290> can<00:04:16.470> control<00:04:17.100> if<00:04:17.430> I<00:04:17.609> just<00:04:17.850> take<00:04:18.090> this<00:04:18.420> curves

00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:18.810 
I can control if I just take this curves

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:23.780 
I can control if I just take this curves
away<00:04:19.020> yeah<00:04:19.530> I<00:04:19.830> can<00:04:20.460> control<00:04:21.000> the<00:04:21.210> size<00:04:21.600> of<00:04:22.790> this

00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:23.790 
away yeah I can control the size of this

00:04:23.790 --> 00:04:25.580 
away yeah I can control the size of this
illness<00:04:24.270> I<00:04:24.480> can<00:04:24.660> make<00:04:24.810> it<00:04:24.930> bigger<00:04:25.110> and<00:04:25.500> you'll

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:25.590 
illness I can make it bigger and you'll

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:27.620 
illness I can make it bigger and you'll
see<00:04:26.040> the<00:04:26.190> section<00:04:26.460> that<00:04:26.640> changing<00:04:27.150> yellow<00:04:27.390> is

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:27.630 
see the section that changing yellow is

00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:28.110 
see the section that changing yellow is
also

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:28.120 
also

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:30.540 
also
coming<00:04:28.419> bigger<00:04:28.630> is<00:04:29.139> also<00:04:29.590> a<00:04:29.620> softness<00:04:30.250> feature

00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:30.550 
coming bigger is also a softness feature

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:33.030 
coming bigger is also a softness feature
so<00:04:31.330> a<00:04:31.360> lot<00:04:31.600> you<00:04:31.750> can<00:04:31.930> do<00:04:32.110> you<00:04:32.350> to<00:04:32.590> fine-tune

00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:33.040 
so a lot you can do you to fine-tune

00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:36.300 
so a lot you can do you to fine-tune
this<00:04:33.610> then<00:04:34.570> there's<00:04:34.840> also<00:04:35.080> a<00:04:35.320> cloning<00:04:36.040> feature

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:36.310 
this then there's also a cloning feature

00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:38.490 
this then there's also a cloning feature
you'll<00:04:36.639> see<00:04:36.910> it's<00:04:37.000> got<00:04:37.120> cloned<00:04:37.540> there<00:04:37.870> I'm<00:04:38.260> not

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:38.500 
you'll see it's got cloned there I'm not

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:39.840 
you'll see it's got cloned there I'm not
going<00:04:38.680> to<00:04:38.740> do<00:04:38.830> a<00:04:38.860> complete<00:04:39.130> cloning<00:04:39.729> it's

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:39.850 
going to do a complete cloning it's

00:04:39.850 --> 00:04:41.340 
going to do a complete cloning it's
going<00:04:40.030> to<00:04:40.090> make<00:04:40.210> this<00:04:40.389> sneak<00:04:40.690> peek<00:04:40.900> too<00:04:41.110> long

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:41.350 
going to make this sneak peek too long

00:04:41.350 --> 00:04:43.110 
going to make this sneak peek too long
but<00:04:41.680> I<00:04:41.710> can<00:04:41.979> show<00:04:42.190> you<00:04:42.250> that<00:04:42.460> you<00:04:42.520> can<00:04:42.610> choose

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:43.120 
but I can show you that you can choose

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:44.969 
but I can show you that you can choose
the<00:04:43.150> cloning<00:04:43.840> section<00:04:44.290> that<00:04:44.380> you<00:04:44.500> want<00:04:44.680> to<00:04:44.740> use

00:04:44.969 --> 00:04:44.979 
the cloning section that you want to use

00:04:44.979 --> 00:04:46.650 
the cloning section that you want to use
I<00:04:45.250> can<00:04:45.460> move<00:04:45.580> it<00:04:45.729> for<00:04:45.850> instance<00:04:46.150> there<00:04:46.419> and

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:46.660 
I can move it for instance there and

00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:49.409 
I can move it for instance there and
you're<00:04:47.260> going<00:04:47.440> to<00:04:47.530> see<00:04:47.770> the<00:04:48.040> part<00:04:49.000> of<00:04:49.120> the<00:04:49.210> tree

00:04:49.409 --> 00:04:49.419 
you're going to see the part of the tree

00:04:49.419 --> 00:04:52.020 
you're going to see the part of the tree
appearing<00:04:49.870> there<00:04:49.900> I<00:04:50.290> can<00:04:50.470> also<00:04:50.710> control<00:04:51.669> the<00:04:51.729> Y

00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:52.030 
appearing there I can also control the Y

00:04:52.030 --> 00:04:55.830 
appearing there I can also control the Y
offset<00:04:52.630> like<00:04:53.380> say<00:04:53.620> that<00:04:53.889> and<00:04:54.660> then<00:04:55.660> you<00:04:55.810> know

00:04:55.830 --> 00:04:55.840 
offset like say that and then you know

00:04:55.840 --> 00:04:57.480 
offset like say that and then you know
it<00:04:55.930> just<00:04:55.960> looks<00:04:56.380> funny<00:04:56.440> with<00:04:56.889> the<00:04:57.160> yellow

00:04:57.480 --> 00:04:57.490 
it just looks funny with the yellow

00:04:57.490 --> 00:04:58.830 
it just looks funny with the yellow
added<00:04:57.790> in<00:04:57.940> there<00:04:58.150> but<00:04:58.300> you<00:04:58.389> can<00:04:58.570> see<00:04:58.720> the

00:04:58.830 --> 00:04:58.840 
added in there but you can see the

00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:01.860 
added in there but you can see the
cloning<00:04:59.290> features<00:04:59.650> already<00:05:00.100> working<00:05:00.760> so<00:05:01.539> that

00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:01.870 
cloning features already working so that

00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:05.370 
cloning features already working so that
is<00:05:02.139> the<00:05:02.680> circular<00:05:03.610> filter<00:05:04.060> then<00:05:05.020> there's

00:05:05.370 --> 00:05:05.380 
is the circular filter then there's

00:05:05.380 --> 00:05:07.650 
is the circular filter then there's
another<00:05:05.740> one<00:05:06.010> a<00:05:06.039> brush<00:05:06.460> filter<00:05:07.030> just<00:05:07.330> make<00:05:07.510> it

00:05:07.650 --> 00:05:07.660 
another one a brush filter just make it

00:05:07.660 --> 00:05:10.080 
another one a brush filter just make it
an<00:05:07.840> image<00:05:08.199> that's<00:05:08.229> going<00:05:08.650> to<00:05:08.710> work<00:05:08.860> better<00:05:09.160> so

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:10.090 
an image that's going to work better so

00:05:10.090 --> 00:05:11.850 
an image that's going to work better so
I'm<00:05:10.180> going<00:05:10.240> to<00:05:10.419> open<00:05:10.510> up<00:05:10.780> the<00:05:10.930> circular<00:05:11.410> filter

00:05:11.850 --> 00:05:11.860 
I'm going to open up the circular filter

00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:14.070 
I'm going to open up the circular filter
or<00:05:12.400> I'm<00:05:12.760> sorry<00:05:12.970> not<00:05:13.120> a<00:05:13.180> circular<00:05:13.690> fall<00:05:13.870> to<00:05:13.990> the

00:05:14.070 --> 00:05:14.080 
or I'm sorry not a circular fall to the

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:18.330 
or I'm sorry not a circular fall to the
brush<00:05:14.470> filter<00:05:14.949> and<00:05:15.160> then<00:05:16.120> I'm<00:05:16.449> gonna<00:05:17.110> add<00:05:17.560> a

00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:18.340 
brush filter and then I'm gonna add a

00:05:18.340 --> 00:05:21.600 
brush filter and then I'm gonna add a
brush<00:05:19.380> then<00:05:20.380> you<00:05:20.470> put<00:05:20.650> your<00:05:20.770> finger<00:05:21.100> down<00:05:21.310> at

00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:21.610 
brush then you put your finger down at

00:05:21.610 --> 00:05:23.879 
brush then you put your finger down at
the<00:05:21.850> starting<00:05:22.300> point<00:05:22.539> and<00:05:22.720> then<00:05:23.110> you<00:05:23.289> start<00:05:23.650> to

00:05:23.879 --> 00:05:23.889 
the starting point and then you start to

00:05:23.889 --> 00:05:26.670 
the starting point and then you start to
paint<00:05:24.460> again<00:05:24.789> I'm<00:05:25.539> painting<00:05:25.810> from<00:05:26.110> an<00:05:26.260> angle

00:05:26.670 --> 00:05:26.680 
paint again I'm painting from an angle
