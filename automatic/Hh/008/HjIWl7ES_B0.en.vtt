00:00:07.110 --> 00:00:11.770
 after 40 years of searching openly weird 

00:00:10.450 --> 00:00:14.590
 hybrid star 

00:00:11.770 --> 00:00:16.930
 astronomers have their lost 

00:00:14.590 --> 00:00:19.630
 treasures that they are looking for over the years and 

00:00:16.930 --> 00:00:21.070
 sometimes decades here's a theory 

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:23.050
 predicts the existence of some 

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:24.789
 mysterious object about which nothing 

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:26.109
 knew earlier to test the theory 

00:00:24.789 --> 00:00:28.449
 critically needed to find 

00:00:26.109 --> 00:00:30.240
 evidence in the case of astronomers as 

00:00:28.449 --> 00:00:32.860
 observations 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:34.750
 the most famous example in their black hole 

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:37.539
 first opened on paper then long 

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:40.690
 searched until finally found here 

00:00:37.539 --> 00:00:44.530
 it's about another story sometime 

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:47.230
 long ago almost 40 years ago or rather in 1975 

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:49.570
 year physicist kip torn and astronomer she 

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:51.789
 liquid theoretically substantiated 

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:55.750
 existence of objects representing 

00:00:51.789 --> 00:00:58.359
 a star in a star is incredibly still 

00:00:55.750 --> 00:01:00.250
 in the life of close double pairs may well 

00:00:58.359 --> 00:01:02.440
 come the moment when more massive 

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:05.410
 the component will explode leaving instead of itself 

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:07.240
 labor neutron star will pass 

00:01:05.410 --> 00:01:08.830
 some time and the second component 

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:10.659
 will live all my life becoming 

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:13.570
 the classic red giant in which 

00:01:10.659 --> 00:01:15.460
 may well absorb the remains of 1 only 

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:17.700
 imagine a dense neutron star 

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:19.869
 inside sparse red giant 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:21.670
 despite the number of stars in this 

00:01:19.869 --> 00:01:24.280
 Universe such objects which by the way 

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:26.890
 got the name of the objects torn liquid 

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:28.720
 or you for a real rarities hunt for 

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:30.430
 which lasted almost half a century 

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:33.130
 and finally ended 

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:35.530
 deafening success that evil 

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:37.810
 represents as claimed torn 

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:38.740
 a shell of burning material around 

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:41.079
 neutron star 

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:43.329
 kernels which creates new elements in 

00:01:41.079 --> 00:01:45.520
 the process of this burning convection 

00:01:43.329 --> 00:01:47.530
 hot gas circulation inside the star 

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:49.420
 bring straight to tight throne days 

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:51.549
 core burning products all over it 

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:52.899
 surfaces long before it 

00:01:51.549 --> 00:01:55.450
 burning will end 

00:01:52.899 --> 00:01:56.649
 outside and even from afar something evil is nothing 

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:58.600
 different from the usual red 

00:01:56.649 --> 00:01:59.530
 supergiant a but everything changes if 

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:01.420
 look inside 

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:03.640
 because these objects should produce 

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:06.399
 an unusually large amount of rubidium and 

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:08.410
 strontium and 3rd zirconium molybdenum and 

00:02:06.399 --> 00:02:10.030
 lithium that will immediately give a huge 

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:11.580
 Unlike conventional red supergiants 

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:13.380
 on the spectrum 

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:15.540
 and finally this spectrum was 

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:19.500
 star found candidate for title 

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:21.060
 the first object of a thorn liquid ey vie 2112 

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:23.070
 is in a small magellan cloud 

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:25.370
 who just see naked 

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:28.170
 the eye in the sky of the southern hemisphere 

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:29.790
 the researchers sieved 62 red 

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:31.980
 giants with 6 and a half 

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:33.690
 meter telescope Magellan to chile and 

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:35.820
 three and a half meters and a telescope 

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:38.160
 apache point observatory in new mexico 

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:40.770
 the very first night of work on the telescope 

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:43.170
 Magellan came the moment he says 

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:44.940
 an astronomer or a vez que we took raw 

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:46.980
 data directly to the display as they are 

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:48.060
 receipts from the telescope and here it is 

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:50.070
 one of the stars even in such 

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:51.810
 disorderly state immediately 

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:54.540
 showed a significant difference from others 

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:57.000
 its spectrum was completely unusual our 

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:59.610
 co-author media maral just by looking at 

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:01.380
 This data said I still do not know what it is 

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:04.350
 but I know for sure that this spectrum 

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:06.000
 I like scientists confirmed 

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:08.670
 increased presence of rubidium 

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.870
 molybdenum and lithium in the gas shell hv 

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:13.350
 2112 

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:14.490
 if chevy 2112 is real then 

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:17.930
 fact will lead to far reaching 

00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:20.280
 the consequences if the temple says hv 2112 

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:22.680
 can be a completely new model 

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:24.450
 As we work the insides of stars 

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:26.790
 can discover new synthesis mechanisms 

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:28.920
 elements to understand how to get exactly 

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:30.209
 such a number of heavy elements in 

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:34.550
 the universe and thereby 

00:03:30.209 --> 00:03:34.550
 clarify how it became as it is
