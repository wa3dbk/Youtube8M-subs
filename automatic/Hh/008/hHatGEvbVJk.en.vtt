00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:05.310
 and what happens people I'm re goya and here 

00:00:02.699 --> 00:00:07.859
 we are with a gameplay of the map and rise 

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:09.810
 the new zombie map even though it's already 

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:11.550
 a week or so that came out but 

00:00:09.810 --> 00:00:13.080
 good today I bring you a little my opinion 

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:14.760
 on the new map and uploaded a video 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:17.279
 speaking a little like that above but 

00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:19.259
 I did not say much because I had just 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:21.449
 play 2 so there are only two games and 

00:00:19.259 --> 00:00:24.539
 I did not know anything about him either 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:26.099
 so good after glancing at him 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:28.109
 well in general the items that has 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:29.369
 had time can be covered is a 

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:31.109
 little more things a little more 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:34.739
 rooms I have to tell you that this 

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:36.390
 map is huge but enormous huge the 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:38.789
 that you have played it, you will have it 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:41.489
 proven has a thousand sites you can 

00:00:38.789 --> 00:00:43.379
 jump from one building to another which if 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:45.120
 you see it from above you can say good 

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:47.429
 these are several buildings you are in 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:50.489
 one and ready then not you are you can 

00:00:47.429 --> 00:00:52.949
 let's say enter several buildings on 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:56.789
 map itself has many deceptive traps 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:58.800
 I have died twice in the same and 

00:00:56.789 --> 00:00:59.789
 I do not expect not to make more mistakes in it 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:01.949
 because the truth is that it is quite 

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:03.900
 frustrating at the end of the video to the best 

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:05.580
 you see it if not later I tell you 

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:07.170
 this is what I told you before going 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:09.030
 jumping from building to building at 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:11.130
 crazy in spiderman plan and the truth is 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:14.250
 that is pretty good this if we 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:16.140
 we move in time three years ago I 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:18.630
 I think nobody would have imagined I lost 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:21.060
 from far that treyarch or the call of duty 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:22.440
 could bring us something this big 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:24.930
 because the truth is that it is tremendously 

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:27.120
 huge compared to the first map that 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:31.170
 I was a tote machete if I'm not mistaken 

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:33.900
 that were about five rooms a lot 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:35.430
 say and well the truth was super 

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:36.710
 entertaining but now we compare it with 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:38.910
 this and they are two worlds totally 

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:41.190
 different have put a thousand stories 

00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:42.780
 new ones are being renewed more and more 

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:45.810
 as for example here the issue of 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:47.250
 elevators and before we had seen the subject 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:48.720
 of the pack up and see and it seemed like a 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:50.580
 amazing thing, now with the theme of 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:52.800
 the elevators have complicated it even more 

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:54.720
 and good has much more gameplay is 

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:56.190
 much more complicated to my way of seeing 

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:58.860
 it also has more complications more 

00:01:56.190 --> 00:02:01.650
 ins and outs, much narrower than 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:03.450
 As I've seen in other willy videos 

00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:05.579
 for example they said 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:07.439
 there was this ex of other call maps 

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:09.899
 of duty 5 that still had not been 

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:12.000
 discovered then good the truth is 

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:13.170
 they are embroidering it to things 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.030
 what to say as they are when I do not 

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:16.349
 like the multiplayer I say it but 

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:17.730
 When I like zombies, I also 

00:02:16.349 --> 00:02:18.989
 I say because the truth is that to my way 

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:20.790
 to see in this case have been exceeded 

00:02:18.989 --> 00:02:22.769
 there you see the buildings opposite 

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:24.810
 to get to them you have to use 

00:02:22.769 --> 00:02:26.040
 other utensils in this map I think that 

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:29.040
 is the springboard I still do not have 

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:31.019
 built so nothing my opinion is yes 

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:33.420
 I recommend buying oslo or not if you 

00:02:31.019 --> 00:02:34.890
 they like zombies definitely yes yes 

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:37.620
 because you're going to love this map the most 

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:39.480
 sure for the multiplayer, well, it's 

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:40.860
 a weapon and four maps with which to 

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:42.569
 they more opinion your I the 

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:45.239
 multiplayer so I play the I do not 

00:02:42.569 --> 00:02:47.040
 I would buy it from afar but good 

00:02:45.239 --> 00:02:48.750
 is your personal opinion a bit 

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:50.040
 So nothing 

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:52.319
 I would like to have gone up even if it extends 

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:54.239
 a little longer I could not for lack 

00:02:52.319 --> 00:02:56.269
 of time because if not this will go up to 

00:02:54.239 --> 00:02:58.620
 12 o'clock at night so nothing in 

00:02:56.269 --> 00:03:00.329
 morning and I was caught three days of strike 

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:03.090
 I hope to record something and upload is a 

00:03:00.329 --> 00:03:05.040
 long gameplay about 78 minutes if 

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:06.540
 you want me to upload more gameplays tell me 

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:07.980
 for the comments I recorded them the 

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:09.060
 I go up without any problem now that I have 

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:10.410
 time so I do not expect anything that I have 

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:13.130
 liked the video today see you 

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:13.130
 goodbye
