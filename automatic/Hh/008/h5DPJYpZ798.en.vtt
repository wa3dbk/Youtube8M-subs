on this as you can see here it he was
deep<00:00:25.920> water<00:00:26.070> horizon<00:00:26.630> before<00:00:27.630> it<00:00:27.990> was<00:00:28.080> like

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:28.260 
deep water horizon before it was like

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:30.740 
deep water horizon before it was like
playing<00:00:28.529> around<00:00:28.800> up<00:00:28.980> in<00:00:29.099> here<00:00:29.179> and<00:00:30.179> now<00:00:30.390> it's

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:30.750 
playing around up in here and now it's

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:32.569 
playing around up in here and now it's
like<00:00:30.840> showing<00:00:31.289> it<00:00:31.410> just<00:00:31.679> really<00:00:32.369> getting

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:34.020 
caught up in a loop current what you see

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:36.380 
caught up in a loop current what you see
here<00:00:34.350> live<00:00:35.100> like<00:00:35.250> this<00:00:35.430> and<00:00:35.730> around<00:00:36.000> and<00:00:36.270> then

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:36.390 
here live like this and around and then

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:38.900 
here live like this and around and then
going<00:00:36.750> back<00:00:36.899> this<00:00:37.050> way<00:00:37.489> really<00:00:38.489> going<00:00:38.700> fast

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:38.910 
going back this way really going fast

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:40.639 
going back this way really going fast
and<00:00:39.210> you're<00:00:39.329> here<00:00:39.510> you're<00:00:39.960> Florida<00:00:40.440> here's

00:00:40.639 --> 00:00:40.649 
and you're here you're Florida here's

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:45.350 
and you're here you're Florida here's
like<00:00:41.690> see<00:00:42.690> probably<00:00:43.469> in<00:00:44.160> Naples<00:00:44.879> somewhere

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:45.360 
like see probably in Naples somewhere

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:49.760 
like see probably in Naples somewhere
down<00:00:45.600> in<00:00:45.629> here<00:00:48.079> Tampa<00:00:49.079> think<00:00:49.320> somewhere<00:00:49.590> right

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:49.770 
down in here Tampa think somewhere right

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:53.180 
down in here Tampa think somewhere right
in<00:00:49.829> here<00:00:50.309> so<00:00:50.940> this<00:00:51.870> is<00:00:52.140> really<00:00:52.590> starting<00:00:53.100> to

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
in here so this is really starting to

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:55.369 
in here so this is really starting to
move<00:00:53.309> south<00:00:53.579> so<00:00:53.969> people<00:00:54.960> need<00:00:55.050> to<00:00:55.170> really

00:00:55.369 --> 00:00:55.379 
move south so people need to really

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:57.439 
move south so people need to really
start<00:00:55.410> paying<00:00:55.860> attention<00:00:55.920> and<00:00:56.430> be<00:00:57.149> sure<00:00:57.390> that

00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:57.449 
start paying attention and be sure that

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:00.830 
start paying attention and be sure that
the<00:00:57.809> keys<00:00:58.520> Cuba<00:00:59.520> and<00:00:59.760> then<00:01:00.000> the<00:01:00.270> East<00:01:00.629> Coast

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
the keys Cuba and then the East Coast

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:02.900 
the keys Cuba and then the East Coast
really<00:01:01.260> prepared<00:01:01.620> to<00:01:01.710> deal<00:01:01.890> with<00:01:02.039> this<00:01:02.190> going

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
really prepared to deal with this going

I've<00:01:37.330> seen<00:01:37.539> in<00:01:37.660> years<00:01:37.840> down<00:01:38.110> there<00:01:38.350> is

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:38.940 
I've seen in years down there is

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:42.270 
I've seen in years down there is
somebody<00:01:39.940> sad<00:01:40.350> we're<00:01:41.350> hoping<00:01:41.560> that<00:01:41.619> maybe<00:01:41.800> we

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:42.280 
somebody sad we're hoping that maybe we

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:45.810 
somebody sad we're hoping that maybe we
can<00:01:42.399> hold<00:01:42.550> this<00:01:42.640> thing<00:01:42.850> off<00:01:43.030> somehow<00:01:44.820> that's

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:45.820 
can hold this thing off somehow that's

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:48.840 
can hold this thing off somehow that's
all<00:01:45.940> I've<00:01:46.060> got<00:01:46.090> now<00:01:47.009> as<00:01:48.009> you<00:01:48.160> can<00:01:48.220> see<00:01:48.280> the

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:48.850 
all I've got now as you can see the

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:50.520 
all I've got now as you can see the
these<00:01:49.180> drifters<00:01:49.539> really<00:01:49.810> are<00:01:49.899> kind<00:01:50.020> of<00:01:50.170> seeing

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:50.530 
these drifters really are kind of seeing

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:54.389 
these drifters really are kind of seeing
it<00:01:50.680> moving<00:01:51.149> westward<00:01:52.149> still<00:01:52.680> still<00:01:53.680> trying<00:01:54.070> to

00:01:54.389 --> 00:01:54.399 
it moving westward still still trying to

00:01:54.399 --> 00:01:56.219 
it moving westward still still trying to
move<00:01:54.580> in<00:01:54.759> this<00:01:54.850> direction<00:01:55.030> but<00:01:55.539> the<00:01:55.600> currents

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:56.229 
move in this direction but the currents

00:01:56.229 --> 00:01:57.480 
move in this direction but the currents
are<00:01:56.350> seem<00:01:56.470> to<00:01:56.530> be<00:01:56.619> working<00:01:56.770> for<00:01:57.160> us<00:01:57.310> even

00:01:57.480 --> 00:01:57.490 
are seem to be working for us even

00:01:57.490 --> 00:01:59.310 
are seem to be working for us even
though<00:01:57.640> the<00:01:57.850> winds<00:01:58.330> are<00:01:58.750> starting<00:01:58.899> to<00:01:59.080> push

00:01:59.310 --> 00:01:59.320 
though the winds are starting to push

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:02.430 
though the winds are starting to push
back<00:01:59.500> this<00:01:59.680> way<00:01:59.970> from<00:02:00.970> the<00:02:01.090> south<00:02:01.330> but<00:02:01.720> i<00:02:02.080> guess

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:02.440 
back this way from the south but i guess

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:03.779 
back this way from the south but i guess
the<00:02:02.530> currents<00:02:02.890> are<00:02:03.009> still<00:02:03.190> working<00:02:03.490> with<00:02:03.640> us

00:02:03.779 --> 00:02:03.789 
the currents are still working with us

00:02:03.789 --> 00:02:06.300 
the currents are still working with us
