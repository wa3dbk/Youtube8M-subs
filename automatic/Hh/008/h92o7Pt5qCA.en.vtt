00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:13.110 
that prior to this match I have

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:15.530 
that prior to this match I have
literally<00:00:13.469> never<00:00:13.920> played<00:00:14.309> before<00:00:14.540> didn't

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:15.540 
literally never played before didn't

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:17.210 
literally never played before didn't
play<00:00:15.630> it<00:00:15.780> in<00:00:15.870> battlefield<00:00:16.320> bad<00:00:16.440> company<00:00:16.560> 2<00:00:16.949> and

play it in battlefield bad company 2 and

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:18.830 
play it in battlefield bad company 2 and
this<00:00:17.279> was<00:00:17.460> my<00:00:17.580> first<00:00:17.880> time<00:00:18.119> playing<00:00:18.330> it<00:00:18.660> in

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:18.840 
this was my first time playing it in

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:21.290 
this was my first time playing it in
battlefield<00:00:19.500> 3<00:00:19.560> the<00:00:20.340> only<00:00:20.670> reason<00:00:20.970> I<00:00:21.029> jumped

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:21.300 
battlefield 3 the only reason I jumped

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:23.150 
battlefield 3 the only reason I jumped
onto<00:00:21.449> the<00:00:21.630> server<00:00:21.869> was<00:00:22.380> so<00:00:22.560> that<00:00:22.680> I<00:00:22.710> could<00:00:22.800> get

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:23.160 
onto the server was so that I could get

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:26.650 
onto the server was so that I could get
a<00:00:23.340> squad<00:00:23.760> rush<00:00:24.119> and<00:00:24.439> squad<00:00:25.439> rush<00:00:25.769> winner

00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:26.660 
a squad rush and squad rush winner

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:29.089 
a squad rush and squad rush winner
ribbon<00:00:27.660> because<00:00:27.900> I<00:00:28.080> haven't<00:00:28.710> gotten<00:00:28.859> those

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:29.099 
ribbon because I haven't gotten those

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:31.460 
ribbon because I haven't gotten those
yet<00:00:29.510> so<00:00:30.510> that's<00:00:30.689> why<00:00:30.810> I<00:00:30.840> jumped<00:00:31.109> into<00:00:31.320> this

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:31.470 
yet so that's why I jumped into this

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:33.020 
yet so that's why I jumped into this
match<00:00:31.679> but<00:00:31.710> I<00:00:31.980> ended<00:00:32.219> up<00:00:32.309> having<00:00:32.489> a<00:00:32.759> really

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:33.030 
match but I ended up having a really

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:34.430 
match but I ended up having a really
good<00:00:33.180> time<00:00:33.239> you'll<00:00:33.690> see<00:00:33.870> from<00:00:34.020> this<00:00:34.140> gameplay

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:34.440 
good time you'll see from this gameplay

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:37.910 
good time you'll see from this gameplay
that<00:00:34.890> I<00:00:34.920> did<00:00:35.270> relatively<00:00:36.270> well<00:00:36.620> this<00:00:37.620> server

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:37.920 
that I did relatively well this server

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:40.639 
that I did relatively well this server
did<00:00:38.280> have<00:00:38.489> more<00:00:38.940> slots<00:00:39.360> than<00:00:39.750> you<00:00:40.500> would

00:00:40.639 --> 00:00:40.649 
did have more slots than you would

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:42.860 
did have more slots than you would
normally<00:00:40.680> see<00:00:41.129> especially<00:00:42.030> on<00:00:42.360> console<00:00:42.840> since

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:42.870 
normally see especially on console since

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:46.369 
normally see especially on console since
it's<00:00:43.320> limited<00:00:43.739> to<00:00:43.770> the<00:00:44.280> standard<00:00:44.730> 8<00:00:44.969> but<00:00:45.719> on<00:00:45.809> PC

as of right now there are a bunch of

as of right now there are a bunch of

with the end result being that you'll

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:58.910 
with the end result being that you'll

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
find 64 player rush servers and you'll

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:01.849 
find 64 player rush servers and you'll
find<00:00:59.160> 64<00:00:59.730> player<00:00:59.940> TDM<00:01:00.420> servers<00:01:00.989> and<00:01:01.289> this<00:01:01.559> was

00:01:01.849 --> 00:01:01.859 
find 64 player TDM servers and this was

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:08.750 
find 64 player TDM servers and this was
a<00:01:02.270> 18<00:01:03.270> player<00:01:04.580> squad<00:01:05.580> rush<00:01:05.880> server<00:01:06.860> so<00:01:07.860> there

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:08.760 
a 18 player squad rush server so there

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:10.789 
a 18 player squad rush server so there
were<00:01:09.000> actually<00:01:09.479> more<00:01:09.720> than<00:01:09.780> just<00:01:10.350> those<00:01:10.500> four

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799 
were actually more than just those four

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:12.679 
were actually more than just those four
people<00:01:11.040> in<00:01:11.430> my<00:01:11.640> squad<00:01:12.000> that<00:01:12.180> it<00:01:12.299> shows<00:01:12.450> in<00:01:12.600> the

00:01:12.679 --> 00:01:12.689 
people in my squad that it shows in the

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:13.880 
people in my squad that it shows in the
bottom<00:01:12.990> left-hand<00:01:13.260> corner<00:01:13.439> of<00:01:13.710> the<00:01:13.799> screen

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
bottom left-hand corner of the screen

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:16.700 
bottom left-hand corner of the screen
and<00:01:14.430> you'll<00:01:15.150> see<00:01:15.450> throughout<00:01:15.930> the<00:01:16.110> video<00:01:16.259> that

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
and you'll see throughout the video that

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:18.289 
and you'll see throughout the video that
they're<00:01:16.920> way<00:01:17.310> more<00:01:17.340> people<00:01:17.700> on<00:01:17.939> the<00:01:18.060> server

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:18.299 
they're way more people on the server

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:20.719 
they're way more people on the server
then<00:01:18.630> there<00:01:18.780> probably<00:01:18.810> should<00:01:19.560> be<00:01:19.740> but<00:01:19.950> the

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
then there probably should be but the

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:22.820 
then there probably should be but the
ticket<00:01:21.030> count<00:01:21.270> and<00:01:21.659> all<00:01:21.900> that<00:01:22.110> stuff<00:01:22.320> was

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
ticket count and all that stuff was

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:25.450 
ticket count and all that stuff was
standard<00:01:23.490> so<00:01:23.909> we<00:01:24.060> end<00:01:24.210> up<00:01:24.390> cutting<00:01:24.869> it<00:01:25.080> close

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:25.460 
standard so we end up cutting it close

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:28.399 
standard so we end up cutting it close
here<00:01:26.460> on<00:01:26.880> this<00:01:27.090> first<00:01:27.450> crate<00:01:27.810> and<00:01:27.960> you'll<00:01:28.080> see

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:28.409 
here on this first crate and you'll see

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:31.749 
here on this first crate and you'll see
what<00:01:28.799> I<00:01:28.829> have<00:01:29.130> to<00:01:29.369> end<00:01:29.490> up<00:01:29.670> doing<00:01:30.659> in<00:01:30.780> order<00:01:31.020> to

00:01:31.749 --> 00:01:31.759 
what I have to end up doing in order to

00:01:31.759 --> 00:01:35.270 
what I have to end up doing in order to
get<00:01:32.759> past<00:01:33.000> this<00:01:33.240> first<00:01:33.450> base<00:01:33.810> but<00:01:34.170> squad<00:01:35.009> rush

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
get past this first base but squad rush

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:38.060 
get past this first base but squad rush
in<00:01:35.579> a<00:01:35.700> nutshell<00:01:35.909> you<00:01:36.509> get<00:01:36.720> 20<00:01:37.200> tickets<00:01:37.409> as<00:01:37.740> an

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:38.070 
in a nutshell you get 20 tickets as an

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:41.270 
in a nutshell you get 20 tickets as an
attacker<00:01:38.400> and<00:01:39.140> there<00:01:40.140> are<00:01:40.259> two<00:01:40.500> bases<00:01:41.009> for

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:41.280 
attacker and there are two bases for

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:44.120 
attacker and there are two bases for
each<00:01:41.670> rush<00:01:41.970> map<00:01:42.180> and<00:01:42.710> the<00:01:43.710> interesting<00:01:44.100> thing

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
each rush map and the interesting thing

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:47.359 
each rush map and the interesting thing
about<00:01:44.780> the<00:01:45.780> each<00:01:46.170> of<00:01:46.380> the<00:01:46.439> bases<00:01:46.829> on<00:01:47.070> these

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:47.369 
about the each of the bases on these

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:49.639 
about the each of the bases on these
maps<00:01:47.549> is<00:01:47.850> that<00:01:48.000> they<00:01:48.090> only<00:01:48.240> have<00:01:48.420> one<00:01:48.659> crate<00:01:48.960> so

00:01:49.639 --> 00:01:49.649 
maps is that they only have one crate so

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:52.819 
maps is that they only have one crate so
the<00:01:50.310> firefights<00:01:51.000> are<00:01:51.180> very<00:01:51.509> focused<00:01:51.840> the

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:52.829 
the firefights are very focused the

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:54.980 
the firefights are very focused the
matches<00:01:53.220> are<00:01:53.340> usually<00:01:53.820> rather<00:01:54.149> short<00:01:54.659> and

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990 
matches are usually rather short and

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:56.330 
matches are usually rather short and
you'll<00:01:55.200> see<00:01:55.439> that<00:01:55.470> this<00:01:55.829> one<00:01:56.040> in<00:01:56.219> particular

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:56.340 
you'll see that this one in particular

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:59.060 
you'll see that this one in particular
is<00:01:56.790> quite<00:01:57.119> short<00:01:57.500> despite<00:01:58.500> the<00:01:58.649> fact<00:01:58.799> that<00:01:58.920> we

00:01:59.060 --> 00:01:59.070 
is quite short despite the fact that we

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:02.060 
is quite short despite the fact that we
cut<00:01:59.250> it<00:01:59.340> close<00:01:59.460> on<00:01:59.729> this<00:01:59.820> first<00:02:00.090> base<00:02:00.329> and<00:02:01.009> as<00:02:02.009> a

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:02.070 
cut it close on this first base and as a

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:04.370 
cut it close on this first base and as a
result<00:02:02.820> it's<00:02:03.149> kind<00:02:03.360> of<00:02:03.479> hectic<00:02:03.689> I<00:02:04.049> don't<00:02:04.259> know

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:04.380 
result it's kind of hectic I don't know

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:05.660 
result it's kind of hectic I don't know
what<00:02:04.560> it<00:02:04.649> would<00:02:04.740> be<00:02:04.799> like<00:02:04.920> with<00:02:05.310> just<00:02:05.490> eight

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:05.670 
what it would be like with just eight

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:07.069 
what it would be like with just eight
players<00:02:06.000> I'm<00:02:06.420> guessing<00:02:06.810> it<00:02:06.869> would<00:02:06.930> be<00:02:06.990> a

00:02:07.069 --> 00:02:07.079 
players I'm guessing it would be a

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:09.770 
players I'm guessing it would be a
little<00:02:07.200> bit<00:02:07.350> slower<00:02:07.649> pace<00:02:08.060> but<00:02:09.060> this<00:02:09.539> was<00:02:09.750> a

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:09.780 
little bit slower pace but this was a

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:11.830 
little bit slower pace but this was a
very<00:02:10.020> exciting<00:02:10.200> first<00:02:10.979> match<00:02:11.310> and

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:11.840 
very exciting first match and

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:13.390 
very exciting first match and
very<00:02:11.930> exciting<00:02:12.379> introduction<00:02:12.980> to<00:02:13.129> the<00:02:13.220> game

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:13.400 
very exciting introduction to the game

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:16.390 
very exciting introduction to the game
mode<00:02:13.840> but<00:02:14.840> here<00:02:15.080> you<00:02:15.230> see<00:02:15.260> that<00:02:15.769> I<00:02:15.800> lay<00:02:16.280> down

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:16.400 
mode but here you see that I lay down

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:19.809 
mode but here you see that I lay down
one<00:02:16.670> Claymore<00:02:17.180> and<00:02:17.440> then<00:02:18.440> I<00:02:18.830> resupply<00:02:19.400> myself

00:02:19.809 --> 00:02:19.819 
one Claymore and then I resupply myself

00:02:19.819 --> 00:02:21.790 
one Claymore and then I resupply myself
and<00:02:20.030> lay<00:02:20.150> down<00:02:20.180> another<00:02:20.599> I<00:02:20.870> have<00:02:21.260> confirmed

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:21.800 
and lay down another I have confirmed

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:24.040 
and lay down another I have confirmed
that<00:02:22.040> you<00:02:22.310> can<00:02:22.489> place<00:02:22.700> up<00:02:23.000> to<00:02:23.150> two<00:02:23.450> claymores

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:24.050 
that you can place up to two claymores

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:27.009 
that you can place up to two claymores
at<00:02:24.319> a<00:02:24.349> time<00:02:24.739> and<00:02:25.330> once<00:02:26.330> you've<00:02:26.510> placed<00:02:26.660> two

00:02:27.009 --> 00:02:27.019 
at a time and once you've placed two

00:02:27.019 --> 00:02:29.740 
at a time and once you've placed two
claymores<00:02:27.590> each<00:02:27.860> successive<00:02:28.489> claim<00:02:28.940> or<00:02:29.209> after

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:29.750 
claymores each successive claim or after

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:32.080 
claymores each successive claim or after
that<00:02:29.930> will<00:02:30.260> replace<00:02:30.709> your<00:02:30.950> oldest<00:02:31.489> Claymore

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:32.090 
that will replace your oldest Claymore

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:34.089 
that will replace your oldest Claymore
on<00:02:32.299> the<00:02:32.810> battlefield<00:02:33.319> so<00:02:33.530> if<00:02:33.620> you<00:02:33.709> have<00:02:33.890> two

00:02:34.089 --> 00:02:34.099 
on the battlefield so if you have two

00:02:34.099 --> 00:02:36.400 
on the battlefield so if you have two
claymores<00:02:34.580> placed<00:02:35.000> and<00:02:35.390> you<00:02:35.930> try<00:02:36.140> and<00:02:36.260> set

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:36.410 
claymores placed and you try and set

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:38.619 
claymores placed and you try and set
down<00:02:36.530> a<00:02:36.590> third<00:02:37.010> then<00:02:37.370> your<00:02:37.549> first<00:02:37.910> claim<00:02:38.390> or

00:02:38.619 --> 00:02:38.629 
down a third then your first claim or

00:02:38.629 --> 00:02:41.320 
down a third then your first claim or
will<00:02:39.080> be<00:02:39.260> replaced<00:02:40.010> by<00:02:40.220> the<00:02:40.430> third<00:02:40.790> claim<00:02:41.120> or

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:41.330 
will be replaced by the third claim or

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:43.809 
will be replaced by the third claim or
so<00:02:42.140> at<00:02:42.440> most<00:02:42.650> you<00:02:42.890> can<00:02:43.010> have<00:02:43.099> two<00:02:43.310> claymores

00:02:43.809 --> 00:02:43.819 
so at most you can have two claymores

00:02:43.819 --> 00:02:45.970 
so at most you can have two claymores
deployed<00:02:44.720> on<00:02:44.870> the<00:02:44.959> battlefield<00:02:45.380> at<00:02:45.560> any<00:02:45.709> given

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:45.980 
deployed on the battlefield at any given

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:48.880 
deployed on the battlefield at any given
time<00:02:46.160> but<00:02:47.150> I<00:02:47.180> put<00:02:47.630> down<00:02:47.780> those<00:02:47.989> claymores<00:02:48.620> one

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:48.890 
time but I put down those claymores one

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:51.250 
time but I put down those claymores one
of<00:02:49.010> them<00:02:49.160> ended<00:02:49.700> up<00:02:49.849> killing<00:02:50.120> a<00:02:50.480> defender<00:02:51.110> who

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:51.260 
of them ended up killing a defender who

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:54.970 
of them ended up killing a defender who
is<00:02:51.380> trying<00:02:51.560> to<00:02:51.680> disarm<00:02:52.010> and<00:02:52.750> it<00:02:53.750> damaged<00:02:54.590> the

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:54.980 
is trying to disarm and it damaged the

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:56.770 
is trying to disarm and it damaged the
second<00:02:55.489> defender<00:02:55.880> and<00:02:56.060> my<00:02:56.269> teammates

00:02:56.770 --> 00:02:56.780 
second defender and my teammates

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:58.690 
second defender and my teammates
thankfully<00:02:57.410> we're<00:02:57.739> able<00:02:57.890> to<00:02:58.099> clean<00:02:58.370> up<00:02:58.519> that

00:02:58.690 --> 00:02:58.700 
thankfully we're able to clean up that

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:00.850 
thankfully we're able to clean up that
second<00:02:59.090> defender<00:02:59.150> and<00:02:59.629> we<00:03:00.319> end<00:03:00.470> up<00:03:00.560> taking<00:03:00.829> the

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:00.860 
second defender and we end up taking the

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:03.580 
second defender and we end up taking the
base<00:03:01.209> so<00:03:02.209> now<00:03:02.540> we<00:03:02.599> just<00:03:02.690> have<00:03:02.900> one<00:03:03.140> more<00:03:03.349> base

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:03.590 
base so now we just have one more base

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:06.339 
base so now we just have one more base
left<00:03:03.950> it<00:03:04.519> corresponds<00:03:05.209> to<00:03:05.450> the<00:03:05.540> final<00:03:05.900> base<00:03:06.079> in

00:03:06.339 --> 00:03:06.349 
left it corresponds to the final base in

00:03:06.349 --> 00:03:09.569 
left it corresponds to the final base in
the<00:03:06.890> regular<00:03:07.370> Rush<00:03:07.579> mode<00:03:07.790> on<00:03:08.120> this<00:03:08.299> map<00:03:08.540> and

00:03:09.569 --> 00:03:09.579 
the regular Rush mode on this map and

00:03:09.579 --> 00:03:12.550 
the regular Rush mode on this map and
this<00:03:10.579> final<00:03:11.120> warehouse<00:03:11.569> is<00:03:11.870> kind<00:03:12.200> of<00:03:12.349> tough

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:12.560 
this final warehouse is kind of tough

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:14.979 
this final warehouse is kind of tough
just<00:03:13.459> because<00:03:13.519> it's<00:03:13.849> so<00:03:14.120> enclosed<00:03:14.510> and<00:03:14.870> it's

00:03:14.979 --> 00:03:14.989 
just because it's so enclosed and it's

00:03:14.989 --> 00:03:17.770 
just because it's so enclosed and it's
so<00:03:15.200> dark<00:03:15.500> inside<00:03:15.920> of<00:03:16.130> it<00:03:16.250> that<00:03:17.030> you<00:03:17.420> really<00:03:17.510> do

00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:17.780 
so dark inside of it that you really do

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:19.900 
so dark inside of it that you really do
have<00:03:17.810> to<00:03:17.989> be<00:03:18.170> careful<00:03:18.250> especially<00:03:19.250> if<00:03:19.639> people

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:19.910 
have to be careful especially if people

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:23.160 
have to be careful especially if people
have<00:03:20.090> say<00:03:20.510> the<00:03:20.720> spec<00:03:21.019> ops<00:03:21.260> black<00:03:21.680> camouflage

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:23.170 
have say the spec ops black camouflage

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:25.720 
have say the spec ops black camouflage
which<00:03:24.170> is<00:03:24.380> a<00:03:24.410> higher<00:03:24.739> level<00:03:25.160> camouflage<00:03:25.670> that

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:25.730 
which is a higher level camouflage that

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:28.360 
which is a higher level camouflage that
you<00:03:26.030> can<00:03:26.180> unlock<00:03:26.389> and<00:03:27.099> equip<00:03:28.099> on<00:03:28.310> your

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:28.370 
you can unlock and equip on your

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:31.629 
you can unlock and equip on your
soldiers<00:03:29.329> it's<00:03:30.109> very<00:03:30.470> very<00:03:30.709> difficult<00:03:30.769> to<00:03:31.370> see

00:03:31.629 --> 00:03:31.639 
soldiers it's very very difficult to see

00:03:31.639 --> 00:03:35.050 
soldiers it's very very difficult to see
spec<00:03:32.239> ops<00:03:32.440> equipped<00:03:33.440> soldiers<00:03:33.980> in<00:03:34.250> dark<00:03:34.849> areas

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:35.060 
spec ops equipped soldiers in dark areas

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:37.780 
spec ops equipped soldiers in dark areas
like<00:03:35.480> that<00:03:35.750> and<00:03:36.019> not<00:03:36.709> only<00:03:36.799> that<00:03:36.950> but<00:03:37.130> spec<00:03:37.579> ops

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:37.790 
like that and not only that but spec ops

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:41.080 
like that and not only that but spec ops
camos<00:03:38.299> actually<00:03:39.260> make<00:03:40.220> it<00:03:40.370> so<00:03:40.549> that<00:03:40.669> infrared

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:41.090 
camos actually make it so that infrared

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:43.360 
camos actually make it so that infrared
scopes<00:03:41.510> don't<00:03:41.959> pick<00:03:42.139> you<00:03:42.260> up<00:03:42.290> either<00:03:42.709> which<00:03:43.220> is

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:43.370 
scopes don't pick you up either which is

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:45.069 
scopes don't pick you up either which is
something<00:03:43.549> that<00:03:43.730> I<00:03:43.790> just<00:03:44.000> learned<00:03:44.120> today<00:03:44.450> and

00:03:45.069 --> 00:03:45.079 
something that I just learned today and

00:03:45.079 --> 00:03:47.199 
something that I just learned today and
is<00:03:45.280> absolutely<00:03:46.280> insane<00:03:46.400> and<00:03:46.910> right<00:03:47.030> there

00:03:47.199 --> 00:03:47.209 
is absolutely insane and right there

00:03:47.209 --> 00:03:51.039 
is absolutely insane and right there
that<00:03:47.329> guy<00:03:47.720> gets<00:03:47.930> my<00:03:48.049> tags<00:03:48.319> so<00:03:48.709> good<00:03:49.430> on<00:03:49.549> him<00:03:50.049> but

00:03:51.039 --> 00:03:51.049 
that guy gets my tags so good on him but

00:03:51.049 --> 00:03:53.199 
that guy gets my tags so good on him but
yeah<00:03:51.200> spec<00:03:51.590> ops<00:03:51.709> camo<00:03:52.220> not<00:03:52.430> only<00:03:52.669> makes<00:03:52.940> you

00:03:53.199 --> 00:03:53.209 
yeah spec ops camo not only makes you

00:03:53.209 --> 00:03:55.420 
yeah spec ops camo not only makes you
very<00:03:53.930> difficult<00:03:54.440> to<00:03:54.530> pick<00:03:54.739> out<00:03:54.919> from

00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:55.430 
very difficult to pick out from

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:58.089 
very difficult to pick out from
surroundings<00:03:56.329> when<00:03:57.169> you're<00:03:57.290> just<00:03:57.470> staring

00:03:58.089 --> 00:03:58.099 
surroundings when you're just staring

00:03:58.099 --> 00:04:00.729 
surroundings when you're just staring
right<00:03:58.519> at<00:03:58.579> it<00:03:58.760> with<00:03:59.090> no<00:03:59.810> infrared<00:04:00.200> scope<00:04:00.560> but

00:04:00.729 --> 00:04:00.739 
right at it with no infrared scope but

00:04:00.739 --> 00:04:02.620 
right at it with no infrared scope but
when<00:04:00.889> you<00:04:00.980> put<00:04:01.549> the<00:04:01.730> infrared<00:04:02.090> scope<00:04:02.389> on<00:04:02.569> it

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:02.630 
when you put the infrared scope on it

00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:05.770 
when you put the infrared scope on it
also<00:04:03.470> makes<00:04:03.769> your<00:04:04.160> enemies<00:04:04.519> more<00:04:05.329> difficult

00:04:05.770 --> 00:04:05.780 
also makes your enemies more difficult

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:07.870 
also makes your enemies more difficult
to<00:04:05.870> see<00:04:06.410> because<00:04:06.620> it<00:04:06.859> actually<00:04:07.010> blocks<00:04:07.370> the

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:07.880 
to see because it actually blocks the

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:10.089 
to see because it actually blocks the
infrared<00:04:08.359> rays<00:04:09.290> I<00:04:09.650> don't<00:04:09.799> know<00:04:09.889> how<00:04:10.069> that

00:04:10.089 --> 00:04:10.099 
infrared rays I don't know how that

00:04:10.099 --> 00:04:13.030 
infrared rays I don't know how that
works<00:04:10.609> but<00:04:11.109> I'll<00:04:12.109> leave<00:04:12.349> a<00:04:12.410> link<00:04:12.530> in<00:04:12.889> the

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:13.040 
works but I'll leave a link in the

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:14.860 
works but I'll leave a link in the
description<00:04:13.489> to<00:04:13.579> this<00:04:13.700> video<00:04:13.910> so<00:04:14.299> you<00:04:14.389> can<00:04:14.450> see

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:14.870 
description to this video so you can see

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:17.379 
description to this video so you can see
the<00:04:15.769> difference<00:04:16.130> between<00:04:16.190> standard<00:04:16.789> camos

00:04:17.379 --> 00:04:17.389 
the difference between standard camos

00:04:17.389 --> 00:04:20.349 
the difference between standard camos
and<00:04:17.630> spec<00:04:18.049> ops<00:04:18.289> camos<00:04:18.739> because<00:04:19.160> it's<00:04:19.519> like

00:04:20.349 --> 00:04:20.359 
and spec ops camos because it's like

00:04:20.359 --> 00:04:22.080 
and spec ops camos because it's like
night<00:04:20.599> and<00:04:20.630> day<00:04:20.840> literally

00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:22.090 
night and day literally

00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:25.590 
night and day literally
so<00:04:22.810> here<00:04:23.050> we<00:04:23.139> go<00:04:23.169> I<00:04:23.650> clean<00:04:24.280> out<00:04:24.460> the<00:04:24.850> M<00:04:25.300> comm

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:25.600 
so here we go I clean out the M comm

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:28.170 
so here we go I clean out the M comm
room<00:04:25.960> before<00:04:26.949> coming<00:04:27.250> in<00:04:27.340> here<00:04:27.370> to<00:04:27.580> arm<00:04:27.760> I<00:04:28.000> saw

00:04:28.170 --> 00:04:28.180 
room before coming in here to arm I saw

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:29.670 
room before coming in here to arm I saw
that<00:04:28.300> guy<00:04:28.449> coming<00:04:28.750> in<00:04:28.810> but<00:04:28.960> I<00:04:29.020> was<00:04:29.139> hoping<00:04:29.440> he

00:04:29.670 --> 00:04:29.680 
that guy coming in but I was hoping he

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:31.469 
that guy coming in but I was hoping he
would<00:04:29.800> delay<00:04:30.100> himself<00:04:30.580> a<00:04:30.790> little<00:04:31.030> bit<00:04:31.270> so<00:04:31.419> I

00:04:31.469 --> 00:04:31.479 
would delay himself a little bit so I

00:04:31.479 --> 00:04:35.129 
would delay himself a little bit so I
could<00:04:31.630> place<00:04:31.840> my<00:04:32.080> Claymore<00:04:33.070> but<00:04:33.970> he<00:04:34.810> ended<00:04:35.020> up

00:04:35.129 --> 00:04:35.139 
could place my Claymore but he ended up

00:04:35.139 --> 00:04:37.110 
could place my Claymore but he ended up
going<00:04:35.380> for<00:04:35.590> my<00:04:35.680> tags<00:04:35.949> or<00:04:36.430> something<00:04:36.970> I<00:04:37.060> don't

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:37.120 
going for my tags or something I don't

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:38.430 
going for my tags or something I don't
know<00:04:37.240> what<00:04:37.419> he<00:04:37.510> was<00:04:37.630> trying<00:04:37.870> to<00:04:37.900> do<00:04:38.110> and<00:04:38.229> I<00:04:38.320> was

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:38.440 
know what he was trying to do and I was

00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:41.460 
know what he was trying to do and I was
able<00:04:38.560> to<00:04:38.740> take<00:04:39.400> him<00:04:39.550> out<00:04:39.810> replace<00:04:40.810> my<00:04:41.020> Claymore

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:41.470 
able to take him out replace my Claymore

00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:43.469 
able to take him out replace my Claymore
you<00:04:41.590> can<00:04:41.710> actually<00:04:41.860> pick<00:04:42.220> them<00:04:42.430> up<00:04:42.460> by<00:04:42.970> holding

00:04:43.469 --> 00:04:43.479 
you can actually pick them up by holding

00:04:43.479 --> 00:04:45.180 
you can actually pick them up by holding
down<00:04:43.510> the<00:04:43.780> R<00:04:43.900> button<00:04:44.260> I<00:04:44.530> don't<00:04:44.830> know<00:04:44.949> what

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:45.190 
down the R button I don't know what

00:04:45.190 --> 00:04:46.800 
down the R button I don't know what
button<00:04:45.580> that<00:04:45.790> would<00:04:45.940> correspond<00:04:46.510> to<00:04:46.630> on

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:46.810 
button that would correspond to on

00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:48.540 
button that would correspond to on
consoles<00:04:47.350> I'm<00:04:47.530> guessing<00:04:47.889> your<00:04:48.010> reload<00:04:48.340> button

00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:48.550 
consoles I'm guessing your reload button

00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:51.300 
consoles I'm guessing your reload button
whatever<00:04:48.880> that<00:04:49.120> may<00:04:49.270> be<00:04:49.300> and<00:04:49.650> i<00:04:50.650> replace<00:04:51.130> my

00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:51.310 
whatever that may be and i replace my

00:04:51.310 --> 00:04:53.879 
whatever that may be and i replace my
Claymore<00:04:51.760> and<00:04:52.030> i<00:04:52.090> go<00:04:52.240> prone<00:04:52.600> like<00:04:53.139> a<00:04:53.169> bitch<00:04:53.530> in

00:04:53.879 --> 00:04:53.889 
Claymore and i go prone like a bitch in

00:04:53.889 --> 00:04:57.240 
Claymore and i go prone like a bitch in
the<00:04:54.040> corner<00:04:54.400> here<00:04:55.110> but<00:04:56.110> i<00:04:56.380> knew<00:04:56.889> that<00:04:56.919> none<00:04:57.220> of
