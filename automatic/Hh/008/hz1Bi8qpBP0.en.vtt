banned but this very strange and unique
matchup<00:01:19.590> allowed<00:01:20.009> me<00:01:20.130> to<00:01:20.189> do<00:01:20.340> something<00:01:20.670> very

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
matchup allowed me to do something very

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:23.510 
matchup allowed me to do something very
cool<00:01:21.119> a<00:01:21.420> clan<00:01:21.930> merger<00:01:22.470> so<00:01:22.650> I<00:01:23.100> realized<00:01:23.400> that

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
cool a clan merger so I realized that

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:25.429 
cool a clan merger so I realized that
having<00:01:23.640> 20-man<00:01:24.210> war<00:01:24.509> wasn't<00:01:24.840> really<00:01:25.020> optimal

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439 
having 20-man war wasn't really optimal

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:27.230 
having 20-man war wasn't really optimal
if<00:01:25.590> we<00:01:25.710> joined<00:01:25.890> both<00:01:26.130> members<00:01:26.430> of<00:01:26.700> either<00:01:26.909> clan

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
if we joined both members of either clan

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:28.850 
if we joined both members of either clan
we<00:01:27.479> could<00:01:27.630> right<00:01:27.930> then<00:01:28.140> and<00:01:28.320> there<00:01:28.380> start

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
we could right then and there start

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:30.890 
we could right then and there start
having<00:01:29.100> 40-man<00:01:29.640> war<00:01:29.970> from<00:01:30.479> there<00:01:30.659> we<00:01:30.780> could

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:30.900 
having 40-man war from there we could

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:32.660 
having 40-man war from there we could
trim<00:01:31.110> the<00:01:31.229> fat<00:01:31.439> overall<00:01:31.860> make<00:01:32.070> the<00:01:32.220> clan<00:01:32.400> much

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670 
trim the fat overall make the clan much

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:34.249 
trim the fat overall make the clan much
more<00:01:32.880> powerful<00:01:33.420> so<00:01:33.720> what<00:01:33.869> ended<00:01:34.079> up<00:01:34.200> happening

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259 
more powerful so what ended up happening

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:36.950 
more powerful so what ended up happening
was<00:01:34.650> clan<00:01:35.100> fillet<00:01:35.400> won<00:01:35.670> pretty<00:01:35.970> decidedly<00:01:36.479> and

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
was clan fillet won pretty decidedly and

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:38.870 
was clan fillet won pretty decidedly and
we<00:01:37.110> gained<00:01:37.320> a<00:01:37.470> bunch<00:01:37.619> of<00:01:37.829> new<00:01:37.979> members<00:01:38.400> now<00:01:38.759> in

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
we gained a bunch of new members now in

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:40.310 
we gained a bunch of new members now in
the<00:01:38.970> past<00:01:39.180> this<00:01:39.329> was<00:01:39.390> never<00:01:39.780> really<00:01:40.079> possible

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320 
the past this was never really possible

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:42.080 
the past this was never really possible
and<00:01:40.619> if<00:01:40.710> it<00:01:40.799> was<00:01:40.979> possible<00:01:41.189> is<00:01:41.579> extremely

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
and if it was possible is extremely

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:43.520 
and if it was possible is extremely
difficult<00:01:42.360> no<00:01:42.930> one<00:01:43.020> would<00:01:43.140> ever<00:01:43.170> want<00:01:43.500> to

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530 
difficult no one would ever want to

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:44.719 
difficult no one would ever want to
leave<00:01:43.649> their<00:01:43.890> clan<00:01:44.100> because<00:01:44.340> no<00:01:44.520> one<00:01:44.640> could

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:44.729 
leave their clan because no one could

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:46.130 
leave their clan because no one could
decide<00:01:45.000> which<00:01:45.240> clan<00:01:45.479> should<00:01:45.689> absorb<00:01:45.990> the

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140 
decide which clan should absorb the

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:48.200 
decide which clan should absorb the
other<00:01:46.290> but<00:01:47.009> now<00:01:47.159> the<00:01:47.220> clan<00:01:47.549> perched<00:01:47.850> can<00:01:48.119> be

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:48.210 
other but now the clan perched can be

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:49.700 
other but now the clan perched can be
the<00:01:48.329> deciding<00:01:48.689> factor<00:01:48.810> and<00:01:49.290> make<00:01:49.380> things<00:01:49.560> a

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:49.710 
the deciding factor and make things a

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:51.319 
the deciding factor and make things a
lot<00:01:49.829> easier<00:01:50.310> this<00:01:50.729> would<00:01:50.850> be<00:01:50.970> the<00:01:51.090> long-term

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:51.329 
lot easier this would be the long-term

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:53.600 
lot easier this would be the long-term
trend<00:01:51.930> for<00:01:52.140> clans<00:01:52.409> in<00:01:52.710> the<00:01:53.100> past<00:01:53.310> it's<00:01:53.460> been<00:01:53.520> a

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:53.610 
trend for clans in the past it's been a

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:55.069 
trend for clans in the past it's been a
little<00:01:53.850> bit<00:01:53.939> of<00:01:54.060> a<00:01:54.479> storm<00:01:54.509> trying<00:01:54.990> to

00:01:55.069 --> 00:01:55.079 
little bit of a storm trying to

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:57.020 
little bit of a storm trying to
find<00:01:55.259> a<00:01:55.320> successful<00:01:55.710> clan<00:01:56.070> so<00:01:56.729> many<00:01:56.909> are
