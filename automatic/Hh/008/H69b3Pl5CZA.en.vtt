00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.710
 take it off he does but I think 

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:06.990
 baby here is everyone can take action 

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:09.300
 doing it is easier for everyone 

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:10.889
 new at nac come from vitesse 

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:13.320
 Then this is asking for the changes 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:15.570
 why difficult 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:17.430
 i would like to play and 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:19.800
 best step last half year mine 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:21.689
 also played mentor injuries 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:25.439
 wasn't such a fit and maybe was one 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:27.869
 half year 5x the house but yes well I was 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:29.429
 interested and other clubs too 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:31.380
 I was able to do good code last night 

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:33.480
 I play football here and I think so 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:35.460
 is possible and I would like to show 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:38.010
 what I can 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:39.149
 so today but there are others too 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:41.100
 clubs interested 

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:44.010
 fc groningen cambuur a few more 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:45.989
 I believe but why incorrect to Breda 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:47.910
 that's how I know the assistant trainer marine 

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:49.800
 exactly I have already cooperated in 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:51.600
 india gave tessa 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:52.800
 So he or she will have a bond with it 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:54.180
 been an important factor to choose 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:57.180
 from nac 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:58.350
 yes it is one of the factors think more 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:59.820
 chance to play 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:01.770
 her name is just technically whole 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:03.480
 strong player but also not only 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:05.460
 but technically strong player that man can 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:06.390
 can play out and in any situation 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:08.520
 to create 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:10.890
 but is also a player with skonings 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:12.240
 ability and also someone with a great 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:14.220
 shot in the legs 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:16.170
 so versatile flank player inventions 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:18.270
 he seemed like a godsend for nac 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:20.670
 to bring him to Breda story 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:22.259
 yes definitely michelle i say i have 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:25.590
 a start after the air imagined us 

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:28.320
 never because ill anyway big clubs 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:30.000
 after him and yes that plays a lot 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:33.329
 always a role but what is a feeling 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:35.119
 an emotional person makes them feel younger and in 

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:37.500
 also feel that music at ease and 

00:01:35.119 --> 00:01:38.880
 yes i have to tell you that i do too 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:40.530
 am pleasantly surprised that ours 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:42.090
 has chosen is nice I think 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:43.170
 a little bit at training camp is possible 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:44.430
 then you really learn immediately 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:47.880
 confessing fellow players 

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:50.189
 is that so important and that is good 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:52.110
 fast beach just before we go 

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:54.090
 to the financial it can teach players 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:56.100
 know the trainers have to play 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:58.590
 so then it will be important 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:00.479
 hence it does what you say to so we 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:01.530
 just say hard day after my jacket 

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:04.350
 encourage 

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:05.820
 next is one that is going to be in will 

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:09.030
 just if you also have a nice technical 

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:10.520
 if you are going to make Houdini how Houdini 

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:15.340

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:15.340
