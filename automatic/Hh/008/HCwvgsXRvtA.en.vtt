00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:16.099 
international space project announced
the<00:00:14.639> launch<00:00:14.820> of<00:00:14.969> an<00:00:15.089> additional<00:00:15.540> solar<00:00:15.809> power

00:00:16.099 --> 00:00:16.109 
the launch of an additional solar power

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:18.980 
the launch of an additional solar power
generator<00:00:16.650> satellite<00:00:17.480> the<00:00:18.480> announcement

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:18.990 
generator satellite the announcement

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:22.250 
generator satellite the announcement
comes<00:00:19.199> as<00:00:19.380> a<00:00:19.410> surprise<00:00:19.560> to<00:00:20.070> many<00:00:21.020> so<00:00:22.020> what

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:22.260 
comes as a surprise to many so what

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:32.060 
comes as a surprise to many so what
exactly<00:00:22.380> is<00:00:22.890> a<00:00:22.949> solar<00:00:23.400> power<00:00:23.760> generator<00:00:31.070> first

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:32.070 
exactly is a solar power generator first

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:34.670 
exactly is a solar power generator first
an<00:00:32.520> earth-based<00:00:33.120> station<00:00:33.870> transmits<00:00:34.170> a

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:34.680 
an earth-based station transmits a

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:38.630 
an earth-based station transmits a
guidance<00:00:35.040> signal<00:00:36.920> upon<00:00:37.920> receiving<00:00:38.370> the

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640 
guidance signal upon receiving the

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:41.420 
guidance signal upon receiving the
signal<00:00:39.030> the<00:00:39.719> satellite<00:00:40.200> uses<00:00:40.590> a<00:00:40.620> large<00:00:40.950> mirror

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:41.430 
signal the satellite uses a large mirror

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:43.940 
signal the satellite uses a large mirror
to<00:00:41.790> generate<00:00:42.180> electricity<00:00:42.690> from<00:00:43.260> solar<00:00:43.530> power

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:43.950 
to generate electricity from solar power

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:48.139 
to generate electricity from solar power
the<00:00:45.860> electricity<00:00:46.860> is<00:00:47.070> then<00:00:47.340> converted<00:00:47.760> to

00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:48.149 
the electricity is then converted to

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:50.810 
the electricity is then converted to
microwave<00:00:48.719> radiation<00:00:49.500> and<00:00:49.710> sent<00:00:50.219> down<00:00:50.430> to<00:00:50.730> the

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820 
microwave radiation and sent down to the

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:54.319 
microwave radiation and sent down to the
ground<00:00:51.000> station<00:00:52.100> the<00:00:53.100> ground<00:00:53.399> station<00:00:54.030> then

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:54.329 
ground station the ground station then

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:56.900 
ground station the ground station then
converts<00:00:54.930> the<00:00:55.140> microwave<00:00:55.710> radiation<00:00:56.370> back<00:00:56.699> to

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910 
converts the microwave radiation back to

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:02.450 
converts the microwave radiation back to
electricity<00:00:57.360> which<00:00:58.050> can<00:00:58.289> then<00:00:58.469> be<00:00:58.680> used<00:01:01.460> the

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
electricity which can then be used the

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:04.579 
electricity which can then be used the
question<00:01:02.910> is<00:01:03.120> do<00:01:03.449> we<00:01:03.570> need<00:01:03.809> such<00:01:04.110> a<00:01:04.140> costly

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
question is do we need such a costly

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:33.990 
question is do we need such a costly
energy<00:01:05.040> program

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:34.000 

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:45.920
