00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:26.020
 Colombia for its tropical location owns 

00:00:23.770 --> 00:00:27.730
 Several environments influenced by height 

00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:29.710
 above sea level on the 

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:31.600
 Andean mountain range meet 

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:33.910
 the cold regions above the 

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:35.860
 1800 meters above sea level 

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:39.280
 where the bovine races of origin 

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:42.190
 European people find their ideal environment without 

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:44.290
 However, most of the herds are 

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:46.570
 found in the north and south latitudes 

00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:49.180
 of the country where the plains below 

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:51.550
 400 meters above sea ​​level 

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:54.390
 have temperatures above 30 

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:57.210
 degrees Celsius all year 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:01:00.180
 despite having a rain regime 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:02.850
 and constant luminosity the prairies 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:05.970
 Tropical perennials are of lesser value 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:08.220
 nutritional and this added to the presence 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:09.930
 of parasites makes the tropics a 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:13.460
 hostile environment for animals of 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:15.380
 European origin for this reason the brangus 

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:18.210
 represents an excellent alternative 

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:20.820
 to produce quality meat in these 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:23.040
 conditions the extensive ranching of 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:25.380
 Colombia pasta in regions with a level 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:28.200
 means of technification the meadows 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:30.990
 include species like stars lines 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:33.750
 angleton and varieties of brac and areas 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:36.509
 for dry and wet acid floors with 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:38.729
 limited rest periods the breeding and 

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:41.070
 sebha develops in the field without 

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:43.200
 supplementation in such a way that the 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:46.050
 brangus for colombia has to be a 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:48.630
 pastoral biotype animal that takes advantage 

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:50.850
 the tropical forages and can keep 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:52.500
 Production during periods of scarcity 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:54.660
 that induces excessive rain in the 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:57.630
 winter or its absolute absence during 

00:01:54.660 --> 00:02:00.060
 the summer in the search for the brangus 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:00.900
 ideal it was found that the three brangus 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:03.660
 eighth 

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:06.420
 successfully adapts heights between 

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:10.320
 the 600 and 2000 meters above the level of 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:12.380
 sea ​​in the low regions is necessary 

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:15.660
 increase the percentage of zebu blood 

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:17.970
 with what you get a five brangus 

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:20.880
 eighths and three quarters 

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:22.740
 the mission of the Colombian association is 

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:26.190
 accompany and direct the production of 

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:28.170
 the country's fishing grounds focusing on 

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:30.240
 manage the percentage of blood angus 

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:32.550
 that best suits each environment in 

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:35.250
 try to obtain precocity and quality 

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:37.500
 of meat without losing the adaptation and 

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:39.950
 rusticity necessary to produce in the 

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:39.950
 tropic 

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:45.080

00:02:53.209 --> 00:02:58.950
 commercial livestock farming integrating for it 

00:02:55.610 --> 00:03:01.709
 the breeding activities lift and it goes 

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:03.629
 For several decades we have been working on 

00:03:01.709 --> 00:03:07.530
 race crossbreeding programs 

00:03:03.629 --> 00:03:09.900
 brahman angus brangus looking for the 

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:11.640
 continuous improvement in the quality of 

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:14.000
 the meat and the increase of the 

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:14.000
 productivity 

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:19.569
 the genetic base began in the years 

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:21.760
 90 with specimens of the angus breeds 

00:03:19.569 --> 00:03:24.360
 brangus imported from the United States 

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:27.220
 and other national herds 

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:29.500
 currently all tested with 

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:31.480
 high genetic value a 

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:33.459
 demanding classification and selection of

00:05:51.030 --> 00:05:55.170
 complements with a low irrigation system 

00:05:52.950 --> 00:05:57.540
 pivot that allows you to face the times 

00:05:55.170 --> 00:06:00.370
 of drought and guarantee a production 

00:05:57.540 --> 00:06:03.280
 permanent forage 

00:06:00.370 --> 00:06:05.350
 All our processes are carried out 

00:06:03.280 --> 00:06:08.050
 making reasonable use of the 

00:06:05.350 --> 00:06:10.840
 natural resources taking very much into account 

00:06:08.050 --> 00:06:12.850
