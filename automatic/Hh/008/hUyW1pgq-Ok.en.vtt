00:00:02.120 --> 00:00:08.550
 Hello and welcome to one 

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:10.349
 another tutorial in this tutorial what 

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:12.269
 I did not do that under the military 

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:14.700
 because it's a bit longer than 15 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:16.740
 I'll do everything under five again 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:18.240
 minutes is as in june creations so 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:20.850
 in this video, it is still always 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:23.430
 yet to this fountain the times on and 

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:29.550
 can switch the like 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:30.240
 So now I'll show you how to do that 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:32.550
 basic builds 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:35.700
 I have such a flatrate here 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:39.690
 Made of sandstone and now tree 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:43.230
 First, the water hole, so to speak 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:46.700
 But we have to first a day 3 x 3 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:52.559
 hole and from there we can then 

00:00:46.700 --> 00:01:01.949
 Two in each direction do so here 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:01:04.280
 even so, and now we'll do it 

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:04.280
 put away 

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:14.030
 yes, too 

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:16.130
 and now we'll do it here 

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:22.430
 which way to make it a kind of circle 

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:25.330
 Now we will wait the floor away 

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:28.270
 On the edge we can let once around 

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:32.290
 to save building materials 

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:35.810
 Let's do this here and here 

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:38.590
 then it looks like that then we sit up 

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:40.790
 three pages still holes here 

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:43.490
 they will then be for what it will be 

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:47.810
 will look at it as well as here 

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:52.100
 then also away and that 's just that 

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:54.830
 hole now we are looking for a few blocks 

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:55.970
 our choice and set the floor 

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:59.119
 I had one I take with the case 

00:01:55.970 --> 00:02:00.800
 quartz you can also use the blocks 

00:01:59.119 --> 00:02:02.149
 Of course we mix but we put here 

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:06.170
 first the floor completely 

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:12.470
 up to the side where not is going 

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:15.140
 there we leave a channel free like that 

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:18.079
 here on the ground so is in the canal 

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:19.459
 free here in the middle, we also set 

00:02:18.079 --> 00:02:22.420
 still block and make a puzzle 

00:02:19.459 --> 00:02:24.680
 it is where we come back again last 

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:25.970
 settle even the number two deep 

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:29.840
 Meinert out also who the 

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:34.400
 Here we go again one and here 

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:35.870
 and again on here I sit 

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:39.019
 just such a mistake was chic 

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:40.730
 looks and then a slip and there can 

00:02:39.019 --> 00:02:44.299
 that ties in later for that 

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:45.980
 Turn on and off the waistband can now 

00:02:44.299 --> 00:02:50.090
 we use the walls 

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:54.730
 here everywhere for the first time 

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:58.630
 freedom then we do something else like that 

00:02:54.730 --> 00:03:00.799
 once again around in the places 

00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:02.350
 we share that I have not shared 

00:03:00.799 --> 00:03:04.420
 took 

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:09.480
 these are the outflows 

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:15.580
 shafts for the water at the places 

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:17.620
 I come two slapstick and here 

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:19.120
 a staircase then the recession may be 

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:22.870
 perform but it is still one 

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:25.500
 wall here can also be a block out and 

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:25.500
 here can be a spoon 

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:32.740
 so and now it goes on with the well 

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:35.290
 The fountain is the first thing you do here 

00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:38.670
 each elicit 

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:41.620
 then you can take politics 

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:42.370
 already looks beautiful and sets 

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:46.540
 here at the corners 

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:49.240
 then you put some on here in here 

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:51.340
 the middle came to put a quad and 

00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:53.110
 put a torch on it again 

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:53.970
 last signal from the back to the top 

00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:59.500
 to be led 

00:03:53.970 --> 00:04:02.110
 Here then come stairs and then 

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:05.410
 comes back on top of a blog and how 

00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:08.970
 then put a torch on it 

00:04:05.410 --> 00:04:08.970
 Exercise upside down 

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:18.270
 all around as well as here 

00:04:15.610 --> 00:04:24.310
 a bit of structure also comes in 

00:04:18.270 --> 00:04:27.090
 then you rehearse the torch 

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:27.090
 ran up stairs 

00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:39.000
 and there is also a slip ran there 

00:04:33.420 --> 00:04:44.050
 here and there it is important that you 

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:48.280
 here above labs sits down and then 

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:51.720
 Once again , this is what leads around here 

00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:58.240
 Here is a hole in each case in four pages 

00:04:51.720 --> 00:05:01.270
 So here again around so there can 

00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:04.240
 water flowing through now we put here 

00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:08.050
 in the middle of pictures and on it 

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:13.390
 again a torch arrive torch 

00:05:08.050 --> 00:05:19.560
 Here we go up stairs again 

00:05:13.390 --> 00:05:23.350
 then we put it on here 

00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:23.650
 Dispenser or the water come out 

00:05:23.350 --> 00:05:27.880
 can 

00:05:23.650 --> 00:05:30.460
 facing up briefs also need 

00:05:27.880 --> 00:05:32.650
 yet they will come to the corners 

00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:35.520
 so that the water is only on the side 

00:05:32.650 --> 00:05:37.770
 flows down and thus the 

00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:40.780
 Groundwater looks nice 

00:05:37.770 --> 00:05:42.130
 then the well is finished 

00:05:40.780 --> 00:05:44.950
 All we have to do is use the water 

00:05:42.130 --> 00:05:48.760
 around the water 

00:05:44.950 --> 00:05:51.520
 a water bucket like to place in the 

00:05:48.760 --> 00:05:55.950
 middle because a middle fits then fill 

00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:55.950
 this is the bund with water 

00:05:58.009 --> 00:06:10.279
 yet 1 2 water water the halt 

00:06:07.849 --> 00:06:12.319
 not so much filled with water 

00:06:10.279 --> 00:06:13.969
 Here we can also once last 

00:06:12.319 --> 00:06:21.649
 do not make it into the water right away 

00:06:13.969 --> 00:06:23.659
 falls and the floor is finished 

00:06:21.649 --> 00:06:26.360
 the button presses comes out 

00:06:23.659 --> 00:06:32.870
 though splits and is down and 

00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:35.139
 You can switch it off again 

00:06:32.870 --> 00:06:35.139
 just a little 

00:06:36.220 --> 00:06:40.150
 that again for this tutorial i 

00:06:38.560 --> 00:06:41.130
 see me agence I have something to me 

00:06:40.150 --> 00:06:43.600
 to come up with 

00:06:41.130 --> 00:06:45.670
 But ideas are always the same 

00:06:43.600 --> 00:06:47.080
 like so many and I am glad that too 

00:06:45.670 --> 00:06:48.700
 always so many comments I have come 

00:06:47.080 --> 00:06:51.520
 already a huge list full of what 

00:06:48.700 --> 00:06:53.440
 But do I want to make time missing the 

00:06:51.520 --> 00:06:55.210
 leuch and last fall ill because of that 

00:06:53.440 --> 00:06:56.340
 do not give that in any case thank you 

00:06:55.210 --> 00:07:00.120
 for watching 

00:06:56.340 --> 00:07:00.120
 until next time
