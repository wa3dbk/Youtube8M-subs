00:00:15.529 --> 00:00:15.539 
you to run more applications maybe

00:00:15.539 --> 00:00:16.550 
you to run more applications maybe
should<00:00:15.659> have<00:00:15.749> a<00:00:15.780> ton<00:00:15.959> of<00:00:15.990> things<00:00:16.170> running<00:00:16.410> on

for applications that aren't really
being<00:00:57.449> utilized<00:00:57.960> right<00:00:58.199> now<00:00:58.320> there's<00:00:58.590> kind<00:00:58.769> of

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890

of<00:01:00.809> clearing<00:01:01.140> that<00:01:01.260> out<00:01:01.410> so<00:01:01.920> that<00:01:02.160> we'll<00:01:03.149> have

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329 
of clearing that out so that we'll have

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:05.810 
of clearing that out so that we'll have
more<00:01:03.510> free<00:01:03.870> memory<00:01:04.050> available<00:01:04.549> so<00:01:05.549> you'll<00:01:05.670> see

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
more free memory available so you'll see

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:08.050 
more free memory available so you'll see
it's<00:01:05.909> completed<00:01:06.240> and<00:01:06.420> freed<00:01:06.780> up<00:01:06.930> quite<00:01:07.799> a<00:01:07.830> bit

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:08.060 
it's completed and freed up quite a bit

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:11.719 
it's completed and freed up quite a bit
so<00:01:09.060> almost<00:01:09.360> a<00:01:09.509> three<00:01:09.720> gigabytes<00:01:09.990> free<00:01:10.729> now

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729 
so almost a three gigabytes free now

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:12.950

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.090 
be pushing the limits completely it'll
automatically<00:01:57.420> clean<00:01:57.689> it<00:01:57.810> then<00:01:58.590> finally<00:01:58.979> can

00:01:59.090 --> 00:01:59.100 
automatically clean it then finally can

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:01.370 
automatically clean it then finally can
set<00:01:59.310> the<00:01:59.399> Refresh<00:01:59.729> interval<00:02:00.049> how<00:02:01.049> often<00:02:01.289> it

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:01.380 
set the Refresh interval how often it

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:02.690 
set the Refresh interval how often it
checks<00:02:01.619> to<00:02:01.710> see<00:02:01.799> how<00:02:02.009> much<00:02:02.130> RAM<00:02:02.310> you<00:02:02.399> actually

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:02.700 
checks to see how much RAM you actually

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:05.300 
checks to see how much RAM you actually
have<00:02:02.880> if<00:02:03.539> you<00:02:03.630> set<00:02:03.840> this<00:02:03.960> to<00:02:04.200> low<00:02:04.409> like<00:02:05.130> one

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:05.310 
have if you set this to low like one

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:08.029 
have if you set this to low like one
second<00:02:05.700> if<00:02:06.000> you<00:02:06.240> have<00:02:06.390> a<00:02:06.420> weaker<00:02:06.930> system<00:02:07.110> you

00:02:08.029 --> 00:02:08.039 
second if you have a weaker system you

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:10.850 
second if you have a weaker system you
may<00:02:08.220> see<00:02:08.660> performance<00:02:09.660> hits<00:02:09.870> on<00:02:10.230> your<00:02:10.500> system

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:10.860 
may see performance hits on your system

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:13.820 
may see performance hits on your system
so<00:02:11.700> you<00:02:11.790> can<00:02:11.880> set<00:02:12.150> this<00:02:12.240> anywhere<00:02:12.600> from<00:02:12.830> one

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830 
so you can set this anywhere from one

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:14.600 
so you can set this anywhere from one
second<00:02:14.250> to<00:02:14.280> 30

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:14.610 
second to 30

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:17.000 
second to 30
seconds<00:02:15.030> ha<00:02:15.990> leave<00:02:16.140> mine<00:02:16.290> at<00:02:16.320> 10<00:02:16.590> seconds

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:17.010 
seconds ha leave mine at 10 seconds

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:19.280 
seconds ha leave mine at 10 seconds
there's<00:02:18.000> also<00:02:18.120> about<00:02:18.330> which<00:02:18.810> is<00:02:18.930> just<00:02:18.990> about

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:19.290 
there's also about which is just about

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:20.600 
there's also about which is just about
the<00:02:19.350> developer<00:02:19.860> you<00:02:20.040> can<00:02:20.070> view<00:02:20.310> their<00:02:20.430> fan

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:20.610 
the developer you can view their fan

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:22.730 
the developer you can view their fan
page<00:02:20.850> and<00:02:21.000> everything<00:02:21.270> else<00:02:21.470> but<00:02:22.470> this<00:02:22.590> is<00:02:22.710> a

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:22.740 
page and everything else but this is a

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:24.530 
page and everything else but this is a
free<00:02:22.950> application<00:02:23.100> in<00:02:23.670> the<00:02:23.850> Mac<00:02:24.120> App<00:02:24.150> Store

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:24.540 
free application in the Mac App Store

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:26.450 
free application in the Mac App Store
and<00:02:24.930> I'd<00:02:25.350> highly<00:02:25.650> recommend<00:02:25.680> checking<00:02:26.070> out

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:26.460 
and I'd highly recommend checking out

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:30.170 
and I'd highly recommend checking out
memory<00:02:26.940> clean<00:02:27.180> thanks<00:02:27.690> for<00:02:27.870> watching
