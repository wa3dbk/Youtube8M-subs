00:00:03.470 --> 00:00:08.340
 what's up, all welcome to style yo 

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:10.019
 I am jose and good and welcome to this 

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:11.309
 good channel before starting this video 

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:12.900
 I would like it if I stay until the 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:14.549
 end to tell you a little about the 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:15.929
 image counseling system that 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:17.580
 Personally, it seems to me very father and 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:19.320
 good as you can see the video are six 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:20.970
 steps to improve your style I'm going to 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:22.920
 talk about some points that I think 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:24.810
 They serve quite well and they can help you 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:26.310
 find or improve your style and goes on 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:27.630
 point number one and what are you going to expect 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:29.279
 for the other points it will be the 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:31.410
 stopped in style and as I say it is 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:33.090
 very important because you go to the foot to know 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:34.530
 what style are you going to wear then you have 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:36.870
 than to know what style you're wearing 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:39.570
 style more and be a little more formal something 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:41.100
 more trendy and something more as you can see 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:42.360
 there are a lot of styles and 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:44.190
 you are going to choose the one that is most 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:45.989
 October to your way of life what you 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:47.730
 I recommend writing interest and go 

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:48.840
 to the men's fashion section and this one 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:50.550
 they already see a lot of images 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:52.199
 about styles and what father wrote in 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:53.850
 very varied styles and you will be able to 

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:55.469
 be choosing the ones that you like and 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:57.510
 based on this is that the style that most 

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:59.160
 go with you and now as point number 2 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:01.230
 is the dress appropriately at your age 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:03.239
 this seems to me like very obvious you do not want 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:03.870
 vestigio you are 40 years old with a guy from 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:05.760
 twenty 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:07.890
 a lot more if you want to say something 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:09.420
 user for example if you're a style 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:11.220
 more agree a little more urban than not 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:12.390
 It suits the age you are in if 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:13.950
 for example you are someone who has 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:15.690
 including if you want to be wearing very 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:17.400
 formal like the images that I am 

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:19.080
 riding at this moment only you 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:21.450
 you're going to look bad and you're not going to project 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:23.070
 adequate image then recommended that 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:24.540
 dress according to your age the third 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:26.759
 point that is very important and many 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:28.530
 careless is that I went is the size of red 

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:30.450
 classic food sold outside there 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:31.860
 people who are thin and say stems 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:33.360
 materials to the TV that are really 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:34.860
 projects I recommend that before 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:36.539
 buy it to finish the tasks in your 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:38.160
 body and in this way it's going to be more 

00:01:36.539 --> 00:01:39.750
 easy when buying clothes and 

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:41.460
 this way so regular that the clothes that 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:43.410
 you are buying you will see well and you will 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:45.000
 to be very comfortable even more comfortable 

00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:46.679
 than using sizes that are not for you 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.420
 as port point is to choose a good 

00:01:46.679 --> 00:01:50.100
 hairstyle that I know of leather features of his 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:51.780
 face many times we have found 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:53.310
 these people the time to see them the 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:55.170
 hairstyle they wear is not a harmony 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:56.970
 visual with its red and this is because 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:58.470
 they do not know the different types of rose 

00:01:56.970 --> 00:02:00.119
 so I recommend you look in 

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:01.440
 internet what kind of face are you for 

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:03.000
 that is when choosing a hairstyle 

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:04.350
 of these and bring three easier and good 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.140
 of the people who have tickets in 

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:08.310
 this part of the head 

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:09.899
 forward I recommend that you 

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:11.790
 you will have to use the hairstyle that you like 

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:13.170
 according to your face and that you do not mind in 

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:14.459
 the tickets today there is a great 

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:16.470
 trend in the next ones that have 

00:02:14.459 --> 00:02:17.910
 tickets and these leave their faces I look for 

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:20.040
 a little more as you can see with 

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:21.870
 one direction glass he tried 

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:23.489
 hide centered on the contrary the 

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:25.080
 take advantage and man them your style 

00:02:23.489 --> 00:02:27.000
 image is also in place number 5 

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:29.250
 we have to take care of hygiene and this is 

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:31.920
 a very important point because this base 

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:33.810
 he bathes every day he is rich that you 

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:35.010
 clothes are clean as you can see is a 

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:36.959
 very broad point and soon 

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:38.280
 aggravate them in a video but I said 

00:02:36.959 --> 00:02:40.080
