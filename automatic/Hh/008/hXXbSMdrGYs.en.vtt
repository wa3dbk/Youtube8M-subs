knife is one that I made 1095 really
thin<00:00:42.300> or<00:00:42.650> thinner<00:00:43.650> stock<00:00:44.040> and<00:00:45.000> this<00:00:45.210> is<00:00:45.360> the

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:45.420 
thin or thinner stock and this is the

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:47.150 
thin or thinner stock and this is the
same<00:00:45.540> exact<00:00:45.900> design<00:00:46.020> except<00:00:46.560> with<00:00:46.710> thicker

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160 
same exact design except with thicker

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:49.550 
same exact design except with thicker
stock<00:00:47.720> but<00:00:48.720> with<00:00:48.840> the<00:00:48.900> higher<00:00:49.050> grind

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:49.560 
stock but with the higher grind

00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:55.280 
stock but with the higher grind
so<00:00:51.590> yeah<00:00:52.590> and<00:00:52.830> then<00:00:53.010> so<00:00:53.850> this<00:00:54.090> is<00:00:54.240> the<00:00:54.510> highest

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:55.290 
so yeah and then so this is the highest

butter<00:01:12.990> and<00:01:13.079> everything<00:01:13.350> I'm<00:01:13.740> just<00:01:13.979> like<00:01:14.100> oh<00:01:14.250> I

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:14.909 
butter and everything I'm just like oh I

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:16.700 
butter and everything I'm just like oh I
don't<00:01:15.060> know<00:01:15.270> though<00:01:15.450> I've<00:01:16.289> done<00:01:16.469> this<00:01:16.619> is

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
don't know though I've done this is

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:18.020 
don't know though I've done this is
really<00:01:16.920> thick<00:01:17.130> compared<00:01:17.520> to<00:01:17.640> some<00:01:17.850> of<00:01:17.939> these

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
really thick compared to some of these

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:21.889 
really thick compared to some of these
other<00:01:18.240> knives<00:01:18.479> here<00:01:18.749> I<00:01:20.240> think<00:01:21.240> a<00:01:21.479> lot<00:01:21.719> of<00:01:21.749> these

00:01:21.889 --> 00:01:21.899 
other knives here I think a lot of these

00:01:21.899 --> 00:01:23.660 
other knives here I think a lot of these
knife<00:01:22.109> stock<00:01:22.439> would<00:01:22.710> not<00:01:22.859> cut<00:01:23.070> this<00:01:23.189> well<00:01:23.399> but

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
knife stock would not cut this well but

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:25.730 
knife stock would not cut this well but
as<00:01:24.299> you<00:01:24.420> can<00:01:24.570> see<00:01:24.689> I<00:01:24.719> kind<00:01:25.109> of<00:01:25.229> took<00:01:25.380> this<00:01:25.499> off

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 
as you can see I kind of took this off

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:28.520 
as you can see I kind of took this off
and<00:01:26.070> made<00:01:26.249> it<00:01:26.280> into<00:01:26.490> a<00:01:26.609> zero<00:01:26.820> grind<00:01:27.119> or<00:01:27.469> kind<00:01:28.469> of

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
and made it into a zero grind or kind of

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:31.039 
and made it into a zero grind or kind of
like<00:01:28.649> a<00:01:28.679> convex<00:01:29.159> edge<00:01:29.659> so<00:01:30.659> I<00:01:30.689> just<00:01:30.869> put<00:01:31.020> on

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:31.049 
like a convex edge so I just put on

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:36.200 
like a convex edge so I just put on
sandpaper<00:01:31.469> and<00:01:31.649> just<00:01:31.999> send<00:01:32.999> it<00:01:33.119> down<00:01:34.609> yeah<00:01:35.609> I'm

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
sandpaper and just send it down yeah I'm

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:39.980 
sandpaper and just send it down yeah I'm
just<00:01:36.359> real<00:01:36.600> thin<00:01:37.280> of<00:01:38.280> course<00:01:38.549> so<00:01:38.759> I<00:01:39.149> can't<00:01:39.840> take

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:39.990 
just real thin of course so I can't take

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:43.010 
just real thin of course so I can't take
these<00:01:40.920> knives<00:01:41.159> that<00:01:41.640> far<00:01:41.880> army<00:01:42.119> is<00:01:42.179> 1095<00:01:42.749> the

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
these knives that far army is 1095 the

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:44.389 
these knives that far army is 1095 the
edge<00:01:43.139> would<00:01:43.319> collapse<00:01:43.649> it's<00:01:43.920> not<00:01:44.100> strong

00:01:44.389 --> 00:01:44.399 
edge would collapse it's not strong

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:49.309 
edge would collapse it's not strong
enough<00:01:45.979> yeah<00:01:47.630> this<00:01:48.630> one<00:01:48.780> I<00:01:48.810> was<00:01:48.960> actually<00:01:49.200> kind

00:01:49.309 --> 00:01:49.319 
enough yeah this one I was actually kind

00:01:49.319 --> 00:01:50.539 
enough yeah this one I was actually kind
of<00:01:49.380> disappointed<00:01:49.859> and<00:01:49.979> even<00:01:50.280> though<00:01:50.369> I<00:01:50.399> know

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:50.549 
of disappointed and even though I know

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:54.200 
of disappointed and even though I know
this<00:01:50.729> is<00:01:50.850> really<00:01:51.090> thick<00:01:51.329> this<00:01:51.509> is<00:01:51.569> uh<00:01:51.689> Oh<00:01:53.210> what

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.210 
this is really thick this is uh Oh what

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:58.609 
this is really thick this is uh Oh what
was<00:01:54.329> it<00:01:54.359> I<00:01:55.340> think<00:01:56.340> was<00:01:56.459> 5/32<00:01:57.270> steel<00:01:57.499> this<00:01:58.499> is

00:01:58.609 --> 00:01:58.619 
was it I think was 5/32 steel this is

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:01.129 
was it I think was 5/32 steel this is
all<00:01:58.770> one<00:01:58.979> though<00:01:59.189> so<00:01:59.399> I<00:02:00.270> probably<00:02:00.780> could<00:02:00.990> thin

00:02:01.129 --> 00:02:01.139 
all one though so I probably could thin

00:02:01.139 --> 00:02:02.809 
all one though so I probably could thin
this<00:02:01.229> out<00:02:01.350> a<00:02:01.409> bit<00:02:01.469> more<00:02:01.799> I<00:02:02.039> left<00:02:02.490> it<00:02:02.609> kind<00:02:02.700> of

00:02:02.809 --> 00:02:02.819 
this out a bit more I left it kind of

00:02:02.819 --> 00:02:05.629 
this out a bit more I left it kind of
chunky<00:02:02.999> I<00:02:04.280> don't<00:02:05.280> know<00:02:05.340> how<00:02:05.459> well<00:02:05.609> that

00:02:05.629 --> 00:02:05.639 
chunky I don't know how well that

00:02:05.639 --> 00:02:08.600 
chunky I don't know how well that
describes<00:02:05.880> it<00:02:06.359> but

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:08.610 
describes it but

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:11.180 
describes it but
yeah<00:02:09.210> so<00:02:09.600> I<00:02:09.960> probably<00:02:10.530> could<00:02:10.770> get<00:02:10.860> a<00:02:10.890> little

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:11.190 
yeah so I probably could get a little

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:14.480 
yeah so I probably could get a little
