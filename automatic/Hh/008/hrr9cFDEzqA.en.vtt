okay sit so we're going to teach a hand
search<00:00:05.029> this<00:00:05.930> is<00:00:05.990> a<00:00:06.230> really<00:00:06.770> useful<00:00:06.980> behavior

00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:08.650 
search this is a really useful behavior

00:00:08.650 --> 00:00:12.129 
search this is a really useful behavior
but<00:00:09.789> lots<00:00:10.789> of<00:00:10.910> things<00:00:11.150> really<00:00:11.360> for<00:00:11.780> teaching

00:00:12.129 --> 00:00:12.139 
but lots of things really for teaching

00:00:12.139 --> 00:00:13.539 
but lots of things really for teaching
are<00:00:12.260> the<00:00:12.320> tricks<00:00:12.590> for<00:00:12.830> example<00:00:13.340> when<00:00:13.430> you

00:00:13.539 --> 00:00:13.549 
are the tricks for example when you

00:00:13.549 --> 00:00:16.060 
are the tricks for example when you
teach<00:00:13.820> a<00:00:14.150> figure<00:00:14.719> Eight's<00:00:14.930> you<00:00:15.559> can<00:00:15.740> use<00:00:15.889> the

00:00:16.060 --> 00:00:16.070 
teach a figure Eight's you can use the

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:18.460 
teach a figure Eight's you can use the
touch<00:00:16.309> so<00:00:17.300> that<00:00:17.449> you<00:00:17.540> don't<00:00:17.750> reach<00:00:18.200> between

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:18.470 
touch so that you don't reach between

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:20.740 
touch so that you don't reach between
your<00:00:18.740> legs<00:00:19.030> when<00:00:20.030> you're<00:00:20.120> teaching<00:00:20.330> a<00:00:20.540> leg

00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:20.750 
your legs when you're teaching a leg

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:22.240 
your legs when you're teaching a leg
we're<00:00:20.960> going<00:00:20.990> forward<00:00:21.680> again

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:22.250 
we're going forward again

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:24.640 
we're going forward again
you<00:00:22.430> can<00:00:22.610> use<00:00:22.760> the<00:00:22.880> touch<00:00:23.200> asking<00:00:24.200> your<00:00:24.289> dog<00:00:24.470> to

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:24.650 
you can use the touch asking your dog to

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:27.760 
you can use the touch asking your dog to
come<00:00:24.860> round<00:00:25.070> you<00:00:25.789> can<00:00:25.970> use<00:00:26.030> a<00:00:26.210> touch<00:00:26.570> so<00:00:27.470> it's

00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:27.770 
come round you can use a touch so it's

00:00:27.770 --> 00:00:30.640 
come round you can use a touch so it's
great<00:00:28.010> for<00:00:28.039> sorts<00:00:28.789> of<00:00:28.910> tricks<00:00:29.300> and<00:00:30.140> it's<00:00:30.440> also

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:30.650 
great for sorts of tricks and it's also

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:33.640 
great for sorts of tricks and it's also
great<00:00:31.490> just<00:00:32.239> for<00:00:32.449> your<00:00:32.599> Houston<00:00:32.960> about<00:00:33.050> for

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:33.650 
great just for your Houston about for

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:37.060 
great just for your Houston about for
example<00:00:33.710> on<00:00:34.130> Tessa<00:00:34.660> because<00:00:35.660> she<00:00:35.870> can<00:00:36.650> be<00:00:36.829> a

00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:37.070 
example on Tessa because she can be a

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:39.460 
example on Tessa because she can be a
little<00:00:37.130> bit<00:00:37.579> reactive<00:00:38.300> around<00:00:38.570> the<00:00:38.750> dogs<00:00:39.020> she

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:39.470 
little bit reactive around the dogs she

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:41.410 
little bit reactive around the dogs she
gets<00:00:39.649> scared<00:00:39.800> by<00:00:40.310> easily<00:00:40.760> believe<00:00:41.060> it<00:00:41.210> or<00:00:41.300> not

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:41.420 
gets scared by easily believe it or not

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:45.520 
gets scared by easily believe it or not
and<00:00:42.410> therefore<00:00:43.390> asking<00:00:44.390> her<00:00:44.570> to<00:00:45.140> do<00:00:45.260> something

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:45.530 
and therefore asking her to do something

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:49.990 
and therefore asking her to do something
else<00:00:45.800> like<00:00:46.040> both<00:00:46.399> on<00:00:46.640> my<00:00:46.760> hand<00:00:48.160> means<00:00:49.160> that

00:00:49.990 --> 00:00:50.000 
else like both on my hand means that

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:51.190 
else like both on my hand means that
she's<00:00:50.180> getting<00:00:50.329> rewarded<00:00:50.899> for<00:00:51.140> doing

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:51.200 
she's getting rewarded for doing

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:52.420 
she's getting rewarded for doing
something<00:00:51.770> she<00:00:51.920> likes

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:52.430 
something she likes

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:55.150 
something she likes
and<00:00:53.050> therefore<00:00:54.050> she's<00:00:54.800> starting<00:00:55.130> to

00:00:55.150 --> 00:00:55.160 
and therefore she's starting to

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:58.180 
and therefore she's starting to
associate<00:00:55.790> that<00:00:55.969> scary<00:00:56.540> scary<00:00:57.290> thing<00:00:57.800> that<00:00:58.040> is

00:00:58.180 --> 00:00:58.190 
associate that scary scary thing that is

00:00:58.190 --> 00:00:59.799 
associate that scary scary thing that is
the<00:00:58.309> other<00:00:58.340> dog<00:00:58.670> with<00:00:58.910> something<00:00:59.329> good<00:00:59.570> which

00:00:59.799 --> 00:00:59.809 
the other dog with something good which

00:00:59.809 --> 00:01:01.479 
the other dog with something good which
is<00:00:59.960> touching<00:01:00.200> my<00:01:00.440> hand<00:01:00.710> and<00:01:00.890> getting<00:01:01.070> rewarded

00:01:01.479 --> 00:01:01.489 
is touching my hand and getting rewarded

00:01:01.489 --> 00:01:04.299 
is touching my hand and getting rewarded
for<00:01:01.670> it<00:01:01.840> okay<00:01:02.840> so<00:01:02.899> the<00:01:03.230> final<00:01:03.469> behavior<00:01:04.100> looks

00:01:04.299 --> 00:01:04.309 
for it okay so the final behavior looks

00:01:04.309 --> 00:01:06.279 
for it okay so the final behavior looks
like<00:01:04.549> this<00:01:04.820> just<00:01:05.630> a<00:01:05.719> touch

00:01:06.279 --> 00:01:06.289
