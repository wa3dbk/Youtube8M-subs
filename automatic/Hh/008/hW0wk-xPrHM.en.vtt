back<00:01:20.369> to<00:01:20.850> the<00:01:21.570> treadmill<00:01:22.110> so<00:01:22.290> I'm<00:01:22.380> just

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
back to the treadmill so I'm just

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:26.270 
back to the treadmill so I'm just
changing<00:01:22.830> it<00:01:23.840> periodically<00:01:24.840> and<00:01:25.619> I<00:01:25.830> think

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
changing it periodically and I think

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:27.859 
changing it periodically and I think
that's<00:01:26.490> really<00:01:26.610> gonna<00:01:26.850> I'm<00:01:27.180> helped<00:01:27.450> me<00:01:27.600> a<00:01:27.630> lot

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:27.869 
that's really gonna I'm helped me a lot

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:30.940 
that's really gonna I'm helped me a lot
and<00:01:28.290> I've<00:01:28.619> also<00:01:28.829> started<00:01:29.250> to<00:01:29.460> do<00:01:29.729> um<00:01:30.150> some

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:30.950 
and I've also started to do um some

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:33.620 
and I've also started to do um some
weight<00:01:31.950> training<00:01:32.430> as<00:01:32.549> far<00:01:32.729> as<00:01:32.850> I'm<00:01:33.030> really

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
weight training as far as I'm really

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:37.880 
weight training as far as I'm really
lightweight<00:01:34.040> 55<00:01:35.040> pounds<00:01:35.400> 10<00:01:36.060> pounds<00:01:36.659> and<00:01:36.890> I

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
lightweight 55 pounds 10 pounds and I

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:41.210 
lightweight 55 pounds 10 pounds and I
think<00:01:38.280> that's<00:01:38.490> helping<00:01:38.850> burn<00:01:39.689> the<00:01:40.680> fat<00:01:40.920> as

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:41.220 
think that's helping burn the fat as

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:45.830 
think that's helping burn the fat as
well<00:01:41.549> and<00:01:42.619> another<00:01:43.619> thing<00:01:43.740> that<00:01:44.130> I<00:01:44.159> do<00:01:44.250> is<00:01:44.840> I'm

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
well and another thing that I do is I'm

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:49.340 
well and another thing that I do is I'm
really<00:01:46.590> organized<00:01:47.159> I<00:01:47.549> try<00:01:48.329> to<00:01:48.360> make<00:01:48.600> sure<00:01:48.659> that

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:49.350 
really organized I try to make sure that

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:50.399 
really organized I try to make sure that
I<00:01:49.710> have<00:01:50.250> a

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:50.409 
I have a

00:01:50.409 --> 00:01:52.889 
I have a
plan<00:01:50.649> before<00:01:51.039> i<00:01:51.070> go<00:01:51.249> into<00:01:51.280> anything<00:01:51.820> so<00:01:52.600> i<00:01:52.630> do

00:01:52.889 --> 00:01:52.899 
plan before i go into anything so i do

00:01:52.899 --> 00:01:54.690 
plan before i go into anything so i do
keep<00:01:53.289> a<00:01:53.409> weight<00:01:53.619> loss<00:01:53.859> food<00:01:54.310> and<00:01:54.429> exercise
