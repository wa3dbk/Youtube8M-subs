00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:27.190 
I'm gonna flip the folder I just lay my

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:29.880 
I'm gonna flip the folder I just lay my
my<00:02:27.790> tongue<00:02:28.120> on<00:02:28.270> this<00:02:28.450> groove<00:02:28.750> here<00:02:29.110> and<00:02:29.710> that

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:29.890 
my tongue on this groove here and that

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:33.180 
my tongue on this groove here and that
this<00:02:30.340> is<00:02:30.490> your<00:02:30.610> jewel<00:02:30.820> panel<00:02:31.300> also<00:02:32.050> once<00:02:33.040> the

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:33.190 
this is your jewel panel also once the

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:35.550 
this is your jewel panel also once the
folder<00:02:33.340> is<00:02:33.490> open<00:02:34.030> I<00:02:34.300> have<00:02:34.750> serrations<00:02:35.380> all

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:35.560 
folder is open I have serrations all

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:37.620 
folder is open I have serrations all
over<00:02:35.800> their<00:02:35.950> folder<00:02:36.310> so<00:02:36.490> if<00:02:36.610> I<00:02:36.730> wanna<00:02:37.030> advance

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:37.630 
over their folder so if I wanna advance

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:39.690 
over their folder so if I wanna advance
forward<00:02:37.840> my<00:02:38.140> finger<00:02:38.560> to<00:02:38.740> make<00:02:38.920> the<00:02:39.220> folder<00:02:39.550> the

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:39.700 
forward my finger to make the folder the

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:42.240 
forward my finger to make the folder the
blade<00:02:39.880> even<00:02:40.060> shorter<00:02:40.720> I<00:02:40.750> can<00:02:41.170> I<00:02:41.440> can<00:02:41.920> use<00:02:42.040> my

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:42.250 
blade even shorter I can I can use my

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:44.010 
blade even shorter I can I can use my
tongue<00:02:42.580> here<00:02:42.910> on<00:02:43.060> the<00:02:43.150> serrations<00:02:43.510> so<00:02:43.810> I<00:02:43.840> have

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:44.020 
tongue here on the serrations so I have

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:46.730 
tongue here on the serrations so I have
more<00:02:44.320> precision<00:02:44.740> also<00:02:45.400> this<00:02:45.970> two<00:02:46.360> little

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:46.740 
more precision also this two little

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:48.690 
more precision also this two little
divot<00:02:47.740> holes<00:02:48.040> here

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:48.700 
divot holes here

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:50.820 
divot holes here
this<00:02:49.000> works<00:02:49.300> for<00:02:49.540> rotating<00:02:50.020> the<00:02:50.290> folders<00:02:50.650> for

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:50.830 
this works for rotating the folders for

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:52.440 
this works for rotating the folders for
spinning<00:02:51.340> the<00:02:51.460> folder<00:02:51.850> for<00:02:52.030> different

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:52.450 
spinning the folder for different

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:54.600 
spinning the folder for different
positions<00:02:52.630> and<00:02:53.590> in<00:02:53.770> the<00:02:53.860> back<00:02:54.040> spacer<00:02:54.580> here

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:54.610 
positions and in the back spacer here

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:57.150 
positions and in the back spacer here
that's<00:02:55.360> called<00:02:55.630> raised<00:02:56.020> back<00:02:56.440> spacer<00:02:56.770> as<00:02:57.010> you

00:02:57.150 --> 00:02:57.160 
that's called raised back spacer as you

00:02:57.160 --> 00:03:00.000 
that's called raised back spacer as you
can<00:02:57.340> see<00:02:57.580> it's<00:02:57.820> raised<00:02:58.180> above<00:02:58.720> the<00:02:59.140> handle<00:02:59.560> and

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:00.010 
can see it's raised above the handle and

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:02.250 
can see it's raised above the handle and
then<00:03:00.250> it<00:03:00.400> has<00:03:00.610> some<00:03:00.640> serrations<00:03:01.540> here<00:03:01.840> so

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:02.260 
then it has some serrations here so

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:04.229 
then it has some serrations here so
that's<00:03:02.560> so<00:03:02.830> I<00:03:02.860> can<00:03:03.130> have<00:03:03.340> a<00:03:03.370> good<00:03:03.610> grip<00:03:03.820> here

00:03:04.229 --> 00:03:04.239 
that's so I can have a good grip here

00:03:04.239 --> 00:03:07.330 
that's so I can have a good grip here
and<00:03:04.630> a<00:03:04.750> good<00:03:04.930> grip<00:03:05.200> here<00:03:05.530> for<00:03:05.770> this<00:03:05.860> folder

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:07.340 
and a good grip here for this folder

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:10.339 
and a good grip here for this folder
now<00:03:08.340> another<00:03:08.879> thing<00:03:09.000> that<00:03:09.360> I<00:03:09.629> wanted<00:03:10.110> to<00:03:10.170> know

00:03:10.339 --> 00:03:10.349 
now another thing that I wanted to know

00:03:10.349 --> 00:03:11.930 
now another thing that I wanted to know
on<00:03:10.530> this<00:03:10.709> one<00:03:10.890> particularly<00:03:11.340> it's<00:03:11.670> got<00:03:11.849> the

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:11.940 
on this one particularly it's got the

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:15.350 
on this one particularly it's got the
vet<00:03:12.120> serrations<00:03:12.690> and<00:03:13.200> the<00:03:13.800> BD<00:03:14.129> ones<00:03:14.340> steel<00:03:14.790> in

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:15.360 
vet serrations and the BD ones steel in

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:17.089 
vet serrations and the BD ones steel in
the<00:03:15.720> blade<00:03:16.080> tell<00:03:16.560> me<00:03:16.650> a<00:03:16.680> little<00:03:16.800> bit<00:03:16.950> about

00:03:17.089 --> 00:03:17.099 
the blade tell me a little bit about

00:03:17.099 --> 00:03:19.160 
the blade tell me a little bit about
both<00:03:17.310> of<00:03:17.489> those<00:03:17.580> features<00:03:17.730> well<00:03:18.330> you<00:03:18.420> know<00:03:18.569> the

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:19.170 
both of those features well you know the

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:21.020 
both of those features well you know the
serrations<00:03:19.500> are<00:03:19.800> actually<00:03:20.099> very<00:03:20.400> very<00:03:20.459> useful

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:21.030 
serrations are actually very very useful

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:24.800 
serrations are actually very very useful
we<00:03:22.430> don't<00:03:23.430> use<00:03:23.580> this<00:03:23.790> desperation<00:03:24.510> to<00:03:24.630> cut

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:24.810 
we don't use this desperation to cut

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:26.690 
we don't use this desperation to cut
ropes<00:03:25.170> I<00:03:25.380> like<00:03:25.560> to<00:03:25.650> use<00:03:25.800> the<00:03:26.010> serrations<00:03:26.340> to

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:26.700 
ropes I like to use the serrations to

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:29.030 
ropes I like to use the serrations to
make<00:03:26.849> some<00:03:27.090> sort<00:03:27.300> of<00:03:27.360> a<00:03:27.450> precision<00:03:27.840> cut<00:03:28.170> when

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:29.040 
make some sort of a precision cut when

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:30.979 
make some sort of a precision cut when
you<00:03:29.130> have<00:03:29.280> to<00:03:29.459> shave<00:03:29.790> something<00:03:30.300> you<00:03:30.569> can<00:03:30.780> use

00:03:30.979 --> 00:03:30.989 
you have to shave something you can use

00:03:30.989 --> 00:03:33.559 
you have to shave something you can use
the<00:03:31.260> serration<00:03:31.830> in<00:03:32.250> order<00:03:32.519> to<00:03:32.670> keep<00:03:32.970> what<00:03:33.450> you

00:03:33.559 --> 00:03:33.569 
the serration in order to keep what you

00:03:33.569 --> 00:03:35.539 
the serration in order to keep what you
are<00:03:33.690> cutting<00:03:33.989> inside<00:03:34.530> the<00:03:34.739> group<00:03:35.010> so<00:03:35.280> you<00:03:35.370> have

00:03:35.539 --> 00:03:35.549 
are cutting inside the group so you have

00:03:35.549 --> 00:03:38.390 
are cutting inside the group so you have
very<00:03:35.880> precise<00:03:36.870> cutting<00:03:37.290> I'm<00:03:37.590> running<00:03:38.069> short

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:38.400 
very precise cutting I'm running short

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:40.509 
very precise cutting I'm running short
on<00:03:38.610> nails<00:03:38.849> but<00:03:39.150> I<00:03:39.180> guess<00:03:39.480> you<00:03:39.569> can<00:03:39.750> see<00:03:39.989> that

00:03:40.509 --> 00:03:40.519 
on nails but I guess you can see that

00:03:40.519 --> 00:03:43.250 
on nails but I guess you can see that
they<00:03:41.519> still<00:03:41.819> the<00:03:42.090> bitty<00:03:42.299> ones<00:03:42.599> the<00:03:42.840> real<00:03:43.019> good

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:43.260 
they still the bitty ones the real good

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:45.589 
they still the bitty ones the real good
steel<00:03:43.650> I<00:03:43.920> actually<00:03:44.340> had<00:03:44.670> the<00:03:44.790> opportunity<00:03:44.970> to

00:03:45.589 --> 00:03:45.599 
steel I actually had the opportunity to

00:03:45.599 --> 00:03:47.390 
steel I actually had the opportunity to
sort<00:03:45.959> of<00:03:46.110> a<00:03:46.230> work<00:03:46.530> a<00:03:46.739> little<00:03:46.829> bit<00:03:47.040> on<00:03:47.099> this

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:47.400 
sort of a work a little bit on this

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:49.490 
sort of a work a little bit on this
blade<00:03:47.640> and<00:03:47.670> it's<00:03:48.090> really<00:03:48.450> hard<00:03:48.780> this<00:03:49.140> is<00:03:49.319> still

00:03:49.490 --> 00:03:49.500 
blade and it's really hard this is still

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:52.339 
blade and it's really hard this is still
similar<00:03:49.860> to<00:03:50.160> for<00:03:50.400> for<00:03:50.640> SI<00:03:51.000> units<00:03:51.810> heat<00:03:51.989> treated

00:03:52.339 --> 00:03:52.349 
similar to for for SI units heat treated

00:03:52.349 --> 00:03:54.770 
similar to for for SI units heat treated
to<00:03:52.500> a<00:03:52.560> very<00:03:52.620> high<00:03:53.130> hardness<00:03:53.640> so<00:03:53.970> I<00:03:54.000> I<00:03:54.329> thought

00:03:54.770 --> 00:03:54.780 
to a very high hardness so I I thought

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:56.509 
to a very high hardness so I I thought
it<00:03:54.870> was<00:03:55.049> really<00:03:55.349> hard<00:03:55.560> to<00:03:55.739> work<00:03:55.920> with<00:03:56.190> when<00:03:56.489> I

00:03:56.509 --> 00:03:56.519 
it was really hard to work with when I

00:03:56.519 --> 00:03:58.490 
it was really hard to work with when I
was<00:03:56.760> trying<00:03:57.030> to<00:03:57.090> work<00:03:57.690> a<00:03:57.930> little<00:03:58.019> bit<00:03:58.230> on<00:03:58.290> the

00:03:58.490 --> 00:03:58.500 
was trying to work a little bit on the

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:01.069 
was trying to work a little bit on the
detent<00:03:58.920> for<00:03:59.310> for<00:03:59.700> one<00:04:00.090> of<00:04:00.209> the<00:04:00.360> prototypes<00:04:00.930> I

00:04:01.069 --> 00:04:01.079 
detent for for one of the prototypes I

00:04:01.079 --> 00:04:02.780 
detent for for one of the prototypes I
was<00:04:01.230> working<00:04:01.650> on<00:04:01.769> this<00:04:02.280> is<00:04:02.430> still<00:04:02.579> seem<00:04:02.760> to

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:02.790 
was working on this is still seem to

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:05.630 
was working on this is still seem to
report<00:04:03.209> on<00:04:03.360> that<00:04:03.390> really<00:04:03.750> well<00:04:04.640> awesome

00:04:05.630 --> 00:04:05.640 
report on that really well awesome

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:07.610 
report on that really well awesome
thanks<00:04:06.209> Polly<00:04:06.420> I<00:04:06.569> think<00:04:06.780> that's<00:04:06.930> the<00:04:07.110> the<00:04:07.410> big

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:07.620 
thanks Polly I think that's the the big
