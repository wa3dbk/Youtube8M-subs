00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:08.400 

the<00:00:06.910> main<00:00:07.090> three<00:00:07.330> fundamentals<00:00:07.960> for<00:00:08.109> the<00:00:08.230> kill

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:08.410 
the main three fundamentals for the kill

00:00:08.410 --> 00:00:11.310 
the main three fundamentals for the kill
forming<00:00:08.770> process<00:00:09.220> I<00:00:09.460> use<00:00:10.299> almost<00:00:10.719> like<00:00:11.020> I

00:00:11.310 --> 00:00:11.320 
forming process I use almost like I

00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:14.190 
forming process I use almost like I
would<00:00:11.380> use<00:00:11.650> tools<00:00:11.980> are<00:00:12.460> the<00:00:13.030> gravity<00:00:13.510> the<00:00:13.750> heat

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:14.200 
would use tools are the gravity the heat

00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:17.760 
would use tools are the gravity the heat
and<00:00:14.440> the<00:00:15.039> time<00:00:15.280> and<00:00:15.670> whatever<00:00:16.539> I<00:00:16.750> create<00:00:17.199> is

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:17.770 
and the time and whatever I create is

00:00:17.770 --> 00:00:20.970 
and the time and whatever I create is
based<00:00:18.130> on<00:00:18.400> these<00:00:18.610> three<00:00:19.029> elements<00:00:19.660> it<00:00:20.619> takes

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:20.980 
based on these three elements it takes

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:24.509 
based on these three elements it takes
time<00:00:21.550> for<00:00:21.970> the<00:00:22.420> class<00:00:22.660> to<00:00:23.080> fuse

00:00:24.509 --> 00:00:24.519 
time for the class to fuse

00:00:24.519 --> 00:00:27.900 
time for the class to fuse
I<00:00:24.660> need<00:00:25.660> the<00:00:25.869> gravity<00:00:26.410> that<00:00:26.890> the<00:00:26.949> glass<00:00:27.220> fuses

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:27.910 
I need the gravity that the glass fuses

00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:30.659 
I need the gravity that the glass fuses
down<00:00:28.150> to<00:00:28.660> the<00:00:28.779> kilcher<00:00:29.230> of<00:00:29.380> the<00:00:29.710> glass<00:00:29.890> slums

00:00:30.659 --> 00:00:30.669 
down to the kilcher of the glass slums

00:00:30.669 --> 00:00:34.980 
down to the kilcher of the glass slums
into<00:00:31.119> the<00:00:31.329> mold<00:00:31.599> that<00:00:32.079> the<00:00:32.230> glass<00:00:33.420> gets<00:00:34.420> cast

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:34.990 
into the mold that the glass gets cast

00:00:34.990 --> 00:00:39.209 
into the mold that the glass gets cast
into<00:00:35.590> a<00:00:35.700> mold<00:00:36.700> and<00:00:37.210> I<00:00:38.050> need<00:00:38.230> the<00:00:38.440> heat<00:00:38.710> that<00:00:39.160> the

00:00:39.209 --> 00:00:39.219 
into a mold and I need the heat that the

00:00:39.219 --> 00:00:43.529 
into a mold and I need the heat that the
glass<00:00:39.520> becomes<00:00:39.820> liquid<00:00:40.690> and<00:00:41.850> ten<00:00:42.850> or<00:00:43.180> twenty

00:00:43.529 --> 00:00:43.539 
glass becomes liquid and ten or twenty

00:00:43.539 --> 00:00:46.650 
glass becomes liquid and ten or twenty
degree<00:00:43.870> more<00:00:44.109> can<00:00:44.920> determine<00:00:45.430> the<00:00:46.239> way<00:00:46.420> the

00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:46.660 
degree more can determine the way the

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:49.520 
degree more can determine the way the
piece<00:00:46.899> will<00:00:47.140> look<00:00:47.350> like<00:00:47.620> it<00:00:47.949> can't<00:00:48.219> be<00:00:48.430> more

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530 
piece will look like it can't be more

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:52.470 
piece will look like it can't be more
constructed<00:00:50.530> with<00:00:51.010> a<00:00:51.039> lower<00:00:51.219> temperature<00:00:51.820> it

00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:52.480 
constructed with a lower temperature it

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:55.049 
constructed with a lower temperature it
can<00:00:52.660> be<00:00:52.719> very<00:00:53.050> fluid<00:00:53.350> by<00:00:54.190> fusing<00:00:54.609> the<00:00:54.820> piece

00:00:55.049 --> 00:00:55.059 
can be very fluid by fusing the piece

00:00:55.059 --> 00:00:57.979 
can be very fluid by fusing the piece
with<00:00:55.300> a<00:00:55.329> very<00:00:55.600> high<00:00:55.780> temperature<00:00:56.410> so<00:00:57.160> it<00:00:57.519> is<00:00:57.670> an

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989 
with a very high temperature so it is an

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:01.439 
with a very high temperature so it is an
interaction<00:00:58.989> between<00:00:59.199> the<00:00:59.859> gravity<00:01:00.670> heat<00:01:01.149> and

00:01:01.439 --> 00:01:01.449 
interaction between the gravity heat and

00:01:01.449 --> 00:01:04.259 
interaction between the gravity heat and
the<00:01:01.690> time<00:01:01.960> what<00:01:02.679> determines<00:01:03.339> the<00:01:03.730> look<00:01:03.910> of<00:01:04.150> the

00:01:04.259 --> 00:01:04.269 
the time what determines the look of the

00:01:04.269 --> 00:01:10.500 
the time what determines the look of the
finished<00:01:04.480> piece<00:01:08.760> using<00:01:09.760> the<00:01:09.880> sheet<00:01:10.060> glass<00:01:10.300> I

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:10.510 
finished piece using the sheet glass I

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:12.920 
finished piece using the sheet glass I
like<00:01:10.690> to<00:01:10.870> create<00:01:11.050> a<00:01:11.140> new<00:01:11.230> raw<00:01:11.590> material<00:01:12.100> and

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930 
like to create a new raw material and

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:16.890 
like to create a new raw material and
one<00:01:13.930> process<00:01:14.410> I<00:01:14.710> like<00:01:15.460> to<00:01:15.640> use<00:01:15.820> is<00:01:16.120> to<00:01:16.690> put

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:16.900 
one process I like to use is to put

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:20.880 
one process I like to use is to put
sheets<00:01:17.320> of<00:01:17.590> glass<00:01:18.690> again<00:01:19.690> like<00:01:19.930> layerings<00:01:20.590> on
