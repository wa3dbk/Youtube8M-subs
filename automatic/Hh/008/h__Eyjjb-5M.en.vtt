00:00:03.890 --> 00:00:11.590
 let's make a series of videos a lot 

00:00:07.580 --> 00:00:14.140
 but very very very interesting 

00:00:11.590 --> 00:00:16.470
 these are ours are bits of 

00:00:14.140 --> 00:00:16.470
 wood 

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:22.460
 all are of the same measure four 

00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:26.410
 inches long 

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:26.410
 they are all practically 

00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:35.970
 it's leftovers but if 4 inches and yes 

00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:35.970
 15-16 

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:41.440
 If i were 

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:43.780
 this is three quarters of an inch is more 

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:48.700
 but I'm going to do it with this 

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:51.210
 kind because they are small pieces 

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:54.440
 it is dangerous to do 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:58.230
 make moldings with small pieces 

00:00:54.440 --> 00:01:00.739
 then this has to be done more 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:00.739
 delicately 

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:06.500
 while thinner this is more 

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:08.659
 dangerous so in this case I'm 

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:10.150
 doing so in 

00:01:08.659 --> 00:01:12.010
 but 

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:15.010
 in order to design we are going to design 

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:18.670
 moldings and before before 

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:23.700
 first of all we have battled for 

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:27.280
 the time of not uploading this videos and 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:30.070
 because the last and a half that we did already 

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:32.610
 is the computer very 

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:34.680
 very slow 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:38.550
 you do not have where capacity to be able 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:42.240
 climb fast lasted 8 hours again this time 

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:45.570
 it's wrong a computer lasts a lot 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:48.960
 time and let's make the video hard 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:52.700
 previous about 18 minutes or something 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:56.190
 so this let's make short videos of 

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:58.590
 6 minutes but we are going to make them 

00:01:56.190 --> 00:02:01.450
 part 12 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:06.360
 I do not know 10 

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:10.470
 so in order to design we are going to 

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:13.430
 to draw half we will design what is 

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:16.470
 a molding and this is very interesting 

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:18.630
 because we are going to 

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:21.180
 to this 

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:22.610
 interesting because we're going to learn to 

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:26.890
 do 

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:30.260
 make any type of molding 

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:34.959
 simply with a device that 

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:41.650
 most of all we have that is a 

00:02:34.959 --> 00:02:45.660
 a saw with this with this device 

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:52.100
 with this device we can do 

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:52.100
 any any type of moldings 

00:02:52.300 --> 00:03:01.230
 it sounds interesting how much time under 

00:02:56.819 --> 00:03:03.010
 three minutes very well then 

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:08.310
 and 

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:08.310
 before I forget, we put 

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:13.019
 on facebook 

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:16.109
 what are we going to do a tour around the 

00:03:13.019 --> 00:03:20.189
 workshop we have not done it for lack of 

00:03:16.109 --> 00:03:23.640
 time because because we are 

00:03:20.189 --> 00:03:26.630
 planning well alright well fine the tour and 

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:30.010
 for that we require 

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:30.010
 not having work 

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:36.819
 and get little get 

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:38.920
 go spend more time how much you can 

00:03:36.819 --> 00:03:42.569
 be that a week prepare this 

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:47.110
 prepare it another one week 

00:03:42.569 --> 00:03:49.130
 now let's tell them we're going to design 

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:54.460
 Y 

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:54.460
 they will love them to design 

00:03:54.840 --> 00:04:00.110
 we take half we take out the other half 

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:06.920
 which in this case would be 

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:06.920
 2 inches 

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:16.380
 We make this as a guide in the nail 

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:19.650
 because it's something something right 

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:19.650
 something hard 

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:26.640
 then there is half of us 

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:29.260
 normally the moldings that we are going to 

00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:33.230
 do will it be for 

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:38.430
 for the crown ground is crown 

00:04:33.230 --> 00:04:43.660
 crown holdings a crown molding 

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:47.760
 the crown molding has cut 45 

00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:47.760
 has another cut 45 

00:04:48.529 --> 00:04:57.110
 another cut 45 

00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:57.110
 and another cut with 5 that's normal 

00:04:57.660 --> 00:05:01.969
 Y 

00:04:59.210 --> 00:05:06.849
 let's do 

00:05:01.969 --> 00:05:06.849
 from this point a curve 

00:05:08.590 --> 00:05:15.670
 approximately like this 

00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:15.670
 and another from the same point 

00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:25.729
 how do we make these curves 

00:05:29.660 --> 00:05:32.560
 we are going to do it 

00:05:34.129 --> 00:05:38.919
 with the Mexican peso 

00:05:44.030 --> 00:05:52.780
 so we can say 

00:05:47.210 --> 00:05:52.780
 that the Mexican peso if it weighs 

00:05:54.240 --> 00:05:57.800
 if it weighs because this video 

00:06:01.460 --> 00:06:07.770
 will weigh 

00:06:03.210 --> 00:06:12.270
 will be strong how much jones 

00:06:07.770 --> 00:06:14.729
 6 we have 6 minutes we are going to cut to 

00:06:12.270 --> 00:06:17.930
 upload and we will follow you 

00:06:14.729 --> 00:06:17.930
