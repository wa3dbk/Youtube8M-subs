00:04:30.450 --> 00:04:30.460 

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:32.580 

they<00:04:30.940> would<00:04:31.060> just<00:04:31.090> attack<00:04:31.270> with<00:04:31.479> this<00:04:32.319> this

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:32.590 
they would just attack with this this

00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:35.460 
they would just attack with this this
and<00:04:32.620> that<00:04:32.800> yeah

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:35.470 

00:04:35.470 --> 00:04:37.770 

this<00:04:36.160> too

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:37.780 
this too

00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:39.840 
this too
rats<00:04:38.380> might<00:04:38.650> as<00:04:38.800> well<00:04:38.980> be<00:04:39.100> dead<00:04:39.250> I<00:04:39.310> don't<00:04:39.580> care

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:39.850 
rats might as well be dead I don't care

00:04:39.850 --> 00:04:42.650 
rats might as well be dead I don't care
about<00:04:39.970> them

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:42.660 

00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:45.610 

so<00:04:43.260> hopefully<00:04:43.470> he<00:04:43.800> does<00:04:43.980> this<00:04:44.460> and<00:04:44.850> that<00:04:45.180> and

00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:45.620 
so hopefully he does this and that and

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:53.159 
so hopefully he does this and that and
doesn't<00:04:46.620> have<00:04:46.740> an<00:04:46.830> agate

00:04:53.159 --> 00:04:53.169 

00:04:53.169 --> 00:04:56.459

there

00:05:06.660 --> 00:05:06.670 

00:05:06.670 --> 00:05:08.310 

this<00:05:07.150> course<00:05:07.450> is<00:05:07.600> going<00:05:07.750> to<00:05:07.840> walk<00:05:08.050> all<00:05:08.290> over

00:05:08.310 --> 00:05:08.320 
this course is going to walk all over

00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:11.970 
this course is going to walk all over
you<00:05:09.510> the<00:05:10.510> exalted<00:05:10.810> means<00:05:11.230> that<00:05:11.530> I<00:05:11.560> don't<00:05:11.830> care

00:05:11.970 --> 00:05:11.980 
you the exalted means that I don't care

00:05:11.980 --> 00:05:25.150 
you the exalted means that I don't care
about<00:05:12.100> fairy<00:05:12.460> invaders

00:05:25.150 --> 00:05:25.160 

00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:29.279 

that's<00:05:25.760> not<00:05:26.090> the<00:05:26.270> worst<00:05:26.540> either

00:05:29.279 --> 00:05:29.289 

00:05:29.289 --> 00:05:31.079 

that<00:05:29.860> means<00:05:30.069> I<00:05:30.159> just<00:05:30.339> attack<00:05:30.610> with<00:05:30.639> everything

00:05:31.079 --> 00:05:31.089 
that means I just attack with everything

00:05:31.089 --> 00:05:35.219 
that means I just attack with everything
and<00:05:31.559> seeds<00:05:32.909> all<00:05:33.909> right<00:05:34.119> so<00:05:34.449> he<00:05:34.629> had<00:05:34.719> switcheroo

00:05:35.219 --> 00:05:35.229 
and seeds all right so he had switcheroo

00:05:35.229 --> 00:05:38.279 
and seeds all right so he had switcheroo
and<00:05:35.740> like<00:05:36.009> that<00:05:36.279> was<00:05:36.479> that<00:05:37.479> was<00:05:37.599> it<00:05:37.659> really<00:05:38.259> I

00:05:38.279 --> 00:05:38.289 
and like that was that was it really I

00:05:38.289 --> 00:05:40.469 
and like that was that was it really I
mean<00:05:38.559> he<00:05:38.680> had<00:05:38.800> other<00:05:39.009> cards<00:05:39.639> like<00:05:39.819> this<00:05:39.969> is<00:05:40.180> a

00:05:40.469 --> 00:05:40.479 
mean he had other cards like this is a

00:05:40.479 --> 00:05:43.829 
mean he had other cards like this is a
car<00:05:40.839> this<00:05:41.139> is<00:05:41.289> a<00:05:41.319> car<00:05:41.589> at<00:05:41.770> this<00:05:41.919> car<00:05:42.569> but<00:05:43.569> I<00:05:43.599> mean

00:05:43.829 --> 00:05:43.839 
car this is a car at this car but I mean

00:05:43.839 --> 00:05:45.510 
car this is a car at this car but I mean
there<00:05:44.080> i<00:05:44.110> think<00:05:44.469> our<00:05:44.619> overall<00:05:44.979> cards<00:05:45.369> were

00:05:45.510 --> 00:05:45.520 
there i think our overall cards were

00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:48.570 
there i think our overall cards were
better<00:05:46.139> so<00:05:47.139> we<00:05:47.710> have<00:05:47.919> to<00:05:48.189> worry<00:05:48.430> about

00:05:48.570 --> 00:05:48.580 
better so we have to worry about

00:05:48.580 --> 00:05:57.250 
better so we have to worry about
switcheroo<00:05:49.499> and<00:05:50.499> he's<00:05:50.619> got<00:05:50.800> some<00:05:50.949> counters

00:05:57.250 --> 00:05:57.260 

00:05:57.260 --> 00:05:58.900 

definitely<00:05:58.040> don't<00:05:58.160> want<00:05:58.310> this<00:05:58.490> because<00:05:58.820> you

00:05:58.900 --> 00:05:58.910 
definitely don't want this because you

00:05:58.910 --> 00:06:03.030 
definitely don't want this because you
can<00:05:59.060> steal<00:05:59.390> it

00:06:03.030 --> 00:06:03.040 

00:06:03.040 --> 00:06:05.070 

it's<00:06:03.550> just<00:06:03.910> a<00:06:04.030> bad<00:06:04.300> card<00:06:04.720> although<00:06:04.990> the

00:06:05.070 --> 00:06:05.080 
it's just a bad card although the

00:06:05.080 --> 00:06:06.330 
it's just a bad card although the
picture<00:06:05.380> is<00:06:05.440> cool<00:06:05.620> it<00:06:05.920> would<00:06:06.040> look<00:06:06.130> good<00:06:06.280> with

00:06:06.330 --> 00:06:06.340 
picture is cool it would look good with

00:06:06.340 --> 00:06:10.550 
picture is cool it would look good with
an<00:06:06.550> older<00:06:07.650> boner

00:06:10.550 --> 00:06:10.560
