00:00:06.370 --> 00:00:09.370
 We're here to get the subject very important these days. 

00:00:10.059 --> 00:00:14.019
 that it is only the periodicity of the proposals to leave more room in the 

00:00:14.019 --> 00:00:17.900
 the planet we can think of as follows research indicates that each 

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:19.130
 five minutes 

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:23.259
 in front of it the open faucet is dispensing 12 liters of water 

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:24.730
 that is 

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:28.119
 this time as well as more or less hot russia of the ajapraz conniving by 

00:00:28.119 --> 00:00:28.979
 example 

00:00:28.979 --> 00:00:33.890
 then the purpose in situation proves 6 imagine a house that has four 

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:35.030
 people 

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:38.030
 of each and toothbrush three times a day 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:42.420
 what will be the waste house dance during this month 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:45.430
 and for a year how to calculate this and calmly 

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:48.000
 so first thing we have to think the following 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.140
 if I have four people and each of the components three times a day 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:54.810
 How many brushing do I have in this house? 

00:00:54.810 --> 00:00:55.940
 exactly 

00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:58.080
 four times three 

00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:00.970
 in each of these schools only 

00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:05.440
 12 million people multiply by two elected then four times three 

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:09.240
 times two of them is what we doubtless spent in one day. 

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:11.509
 feels that calculating increases 

00:01:11.509 --> 00:01:14.689
 the issue denounced as essentially commercial 

00:01:14.689 --> 00:01:16.740
 30-day men 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:18.980
 making this product the stepdaughter 

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:22.990
 to this very large number of four thousand three hundred and twenty liters of water and 

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:24.100
 means 

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:25.610
 now imagine this 

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:27.220
 during the year 

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:29.799
 We're going to have four a320 a month. 

00:01:29.799 --> 00:01:32.500
 so it's time to do it twice 

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:33.520
 that is 

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:38.670
 the consumption the waste of water only brush the teeth part of this value here 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:43.100
 what impresses people 51 thousand 840 liters of water 

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:46.710
 how can it cause 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:50.160
 if we can think of another way with spot 

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:52.120
 the house has a swimming pool 

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:56.360
 as we may think that this value the attacker could do but should always 

00:01:56.360 --> 00:02:00.310
 here it is in the shape of a parallelepiped which they believe 

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:03.440
 and will think of these nations 

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:06.470
 up to a height of two meters of very reasonable height 

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:10.610
 has a length and 7 thousand to two meters a width of 3 thousand or 6 meters 

00:02:11.429 --> 00:02:14.909
 how to calculate the volume of looting and comprehensive until abortion 

00:02:15.649 --> 00:02:18.609
 a goal from a parallelepiped we can calculate 

00:02:18.609 --> 00:02:21.609
 simply by multiplying the three dimensions or 

00:02:22.629 --> 00:02:25.779
 one must have violated laws of these 3,000 accepted 

00:02:26.549 --> 00:02:29.669
 numerically speaking, 51 thousand eighty-four 

00:02:30.479 --> 00:02:33.049
 and so that the units are in methods 

00:02:33.049 --> 00:02:35.579
 because of this begins in meters 

00:02:35.579 --> 00:02:36.699
 cubic 

00:02:36.699 --> 00:02:40.699
 For us to match cubic meters to the inside, it's not 

00:02:40.699 --> 00:02:44.049
 cool we have to first go from cubic meters the descent was expelled 

00:02:44.639 --> 00:02:48.459
 or a single decimal place that is leading the public 

00:02:48.459 --> 00:02:50.349
 We have to multiply this. 

00:02:50.349 --> 00:02:52.119
 Not even a little shampoo. 

00:02:52.119 --> 00:02:55.069
 so we leave 59 84 

00:02:55.069 --> 00:02:58.439
 for 59 84 ten of them are the people 

00:02:58.439 --> 00:03:02.739
 apologize now which ones seemed so much easier to be tattooed 

00:03:02.739 --> 00:03:05.919
 still in public is going to die 

00:03:05.919 --> 00:03:07.049
 that is 

00:03:07.049 --> 00:03:13.739
 this pool and has a goal of 51 thousand 840 pounds exactly the good time that this 

00:03:13.739 --> 00:03:17.709
 house enough pressure of the swaps with disgruntled staff with the faucet 

00:03:17.709 --> 00:03:19.879
 open 

00:03:19.879 --> 00:03:22.110
 personal conscience he thinks 

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:22.790
 See you
