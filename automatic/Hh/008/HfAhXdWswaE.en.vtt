 need for speed one of the sagas more 

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:19.730
 prolific and long-lived history of 

00:00:18.199 --> 00:00:22.189
 videogames go to the cinema 

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:23.510
 from April 4 we can see in the 

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:25.310
 big screen the more races 

00:00:23.510 --> 00:00:27.590
 spectacular where they will face 

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:29.689
 super sports as spectacular as 

00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:32.210
 the koenigsegg agera r the lamborghini 

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:34.220
 sixth element the bugatti veyron or the 

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:36.380
 mclaren p 1 

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:38.060
 on the occasion of the premiere we could talk 

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:39.500
 with the director of the movie scott 

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:40.400
 downs and with the two actors 

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:43.340
 protagonists 

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:45.230
 aaron paul and dominic cooper under the 

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:46.130
 dreamworks umbrella the producer of 

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:48.080
 steven spielberg 

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:50.600
 the film recovers the spirit of the 

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:52.570
 car movies of the 60s and 70s 

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:54.470
 as bullying or vanishing point 

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:56.570
 precisely the father of the director 

00:00:54.470 --> 00:01:00.340
 participated as a double action in many 

00:00:56.570 --> 00:01:00.340
 of those tapes there is no 

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:05.660
 my father was double acting in some 

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:07.460
 of the best car movies that 

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:09.530
 there has never been a vanishing point 

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:11.270
 smokey and the band it's blitz or the 

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:13.240
 blues brothers that had a huge 

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:15.280
 influence 

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:17.140
 I still think they are the best and 

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:19.990
 I wanted to pay my respects to my 

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:21.670
 parents and those guys study them a lot 

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:24.340
 and I'm still trying to find out why 

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:27.640
 those movies are still the best weigh 

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:30.130
 to which they are from almost 50 years ago and I think 

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:31.570
 that the reason is that they are all real not 

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:34.119
 there were computer generated images 

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:36.429
 the actors were driving there was not a 

00:01:34.119 --> 00:01:38.950
 musical assembly but engine noise 

00:01:36.429 --> 00:01:41.259
 visceral that's what I wanted to do with 

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:42.939
 need for speed books I wanted to make a 

00:01:41.259 --> 00:01:44.710
 movie based on the culture of the 

00:01:42.939 --> 00:01:47.470
 cars that started the genre in the years 

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:49.539
 60 as a bullitt that I think is the best 

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:52.509
 car movie of all time 

00:01:49.539 --> 00:01:53.979
 and I think nobody can deny it 

00:01:52.509 --> 00:01:55.899
 the absence of images generated by 

00:01:53.979 --> 00:01:57.700
 computer is the cornerstone of need 

00:01:55.899 --> 00:02:00.459
 for speed what the difference of the 

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:01.869
 saga fast and furious according to the director 

00:02:00.459 --> 00:02:03.759
 everything that happens on the screen is 

00:02:01.869 --> 00:02:05.530
 recorded in a real way with such moments 

00:02:03.759 --> 00:02:07.600
 spectacular as jumps on the 

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:10.209
 traffic or a fall from a precipice 

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:12.560
 with a helicopter in between was without 

00:02:10.209 --> 00:02:16.790
 doubt the most complicated part of the shooting 

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:19.220
 and I love it because there is not a hint of 

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:21.290
 graphic computing in the movie 

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:23.480
 ask people to do that 

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:26.330
 it seemed real the answer was yes and 

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:29.510
 that was a good reason there are movies 

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:32.030
 that are fun but are not real is 

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:33.620
 more challenging I love the fact 

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:36.020
 try to make a car jump by 

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:38.330
 on top of the traffic that's done 

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:40.940
 50 years in the movies of cars 

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:42.800
 why not continue the car scene 

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:44.630
 jumping over a cliff with the 

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:46.850
 helicopter is the most proud 

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:49.580
 I'm because it's something that had not been 

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:51.200
 I never wanted it to be real and 

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:53.480
 I take a lot of planning and 

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:55.700
 preparation but it was definitely 

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:57.680
 possible stopped mini cooper that 

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:59.420
 interprets the role of antagonist was very 

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:00.830
 important the philosophy of making a 

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:04.330
 movie that moved away from the 

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:04.330
 modern referents of the genre 

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:10.080
 it's very funny I have always been 

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:12.240
 passionate cars so it was 

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:14.790
 exciting to embark on this project 

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:16.710
 I always cared if this was going to be 

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:19.320
 another one of those movies with a rhythm of 

00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:22.080
 action based only on cochazos being 

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:23.700
 ridiculously fast or with shootings not 

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:25.320
 It was something I wanted to do but I 

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:27.090
 It was very clear from the beginning that 

00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:28.950
 the director wanted to do something else 

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:30.780
 similar to what he had 

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:33.120
 excited in his childhood then his father 

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:35.310
 was double action in movies like 

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:37.200
 bullying when I heard that that was what 

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:39.420
 I wanted to do I felt very attracted 

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:41.340
 about what it is like to make a movie 

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:43.320
 with fast cars as the cornerstone 

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:45.150
 I think it's also important 

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:47.070
 human aspect of the movie you have to 

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:49.320
 make sure it is totally credible 

00:03:47.070 --> 00:03:52.020
 and that there is an interesting story there 

00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:54.150
 simply fast cars 

00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:56.460
 the filming method forced to use 

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:58.980
 professional drivers and replicas of 

00:03:56.460 --> 00:04:01.170
 the vehicles for example a 

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:03.210
 Real koenigsegg valued at 17 million 

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:05.730
 of dollars but also several replicas 

00:04:03.210 --> 00:04:08.010
 of 300 thousand dollars each and equipped 

00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:09.570
 with all types of cameras managed this 

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:11.760
 technology was one of the great 

00:04:09.570 --> 00:04:13.830
 challenges the factors led during 

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:15.450
 certain parts and the scenes of 

00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:16.890
 risk fell on professionals who 

00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:19.140
 they had to drive the cars from 

00:04:16.890 --> 00:04:22.340
 special frames placed on the 

00:04:19.140 --> 00:04:22.340
 back of the cars 

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:28.480
 says many parts of driving 

00:04:26.169 --> 00:04:30.340
 we had an amazing team of doubles of 

00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:32.230
 action for acrobatics and scenes 

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:35.229
 more risky in terms of speed 

00:04:32.230 --> 00:04:38.500
 maximum was about 200 210 kilometers 

00:04:35.229 --> 00:04:40.479
 per hour but to go to 300 or 320 yes that 

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:42.190
 there were professional drivers because 

00:04:40.479 --> 00:04:45.360
 those konyshev for example are 

00:04:42.190 --> 00:04:45.360
 incredibly dangerous 

00:04:46.689 --> 00:04:50.810
 we use many cars in the movie but 

00:04:49.159 --> 00:04:53.000
 when it was time to record the 

00:04:50.810 --> 00:04:55.009
 supercars became necessary 

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:56.990
 manufacture racing cars that 

00:04:55.009 --> 00:04:59.240
 they look like the supercars and that 

00:04:56.990 --> 00:05:01.550
 the time will protect the action doubles 

00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:03.889
 good frameworks were needed and 

00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:05.810
 devices the supercars do not 

00:05:03.889 --> 00:05:07.430
 they have the cabin that we needed 

00:05:05.810 --> 00:05:09.229
 to put within the systems of 

00:05:07.430 --> 00:05:12.379
 filming now so we had to do 

00:05:09.229 --> 00:05:14.539
 replicas those super sports are works 

00:05:12.379 --> 00:05:16.610
 of art to the point that of some 

00:05:14.539 --> 00:05:18.979
 there are only three in the world as the 

00:05:16.610 --> 00:05:20.810
 lamborghini sixty elements for your great 

00:05:18.979 --> 00:05:21.740
 role as jesse pinkman in the series 

00:05:20.810 --> 00:05:23.210
 breaking bad 

00:05:21.740 --> 00:05:25.550
 aaron paul has become one of 

00:05:23.210 --> 00:05:27.289
 the actors of the moment besides the need 

00:05:25.550 --> 00:05:29.569
 for speed we will see you soon 

00:05:27.289 --> 00:05:30.620
 also in exodus the biblical film 

00:05:29.569 --> 00:05:32.870
 that has been recording in 

00:05:30.620 --> 00:05:34.550
 fuerteventura de almerÃ­a the actor we 

00:05:32.870 --> 00:05:36.379
 I counted the difference between working in 

00:05:34.550 --> 00:05:37.789
 television and in the cinema within a 

00:05:36.379 --> 00:05:40.270
 gender as peculiar as is the 

00:05:37.789 --> 00:05:40.270
 careers 

00:05:42.550 --> 00:05:46.450
 it's completely different though 

00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:47.950
 depends on the size of the movie in 

00:05:46.450 --> 00:05:49.660
 'breaking bad' an episode is recorded 

00:05:47.950 --> 00:05:51.790
 whole in 8 days so you have to 

00:05:49.660 --> 00:05:54.070
 put a lot of things in a single day to 

00:05:51.790 --> 00:05:55.960
 a screen time of 45 minutes with 

00:05:54.070 --> 00:05:58.030
 need for speed we had about four 

00:05:55.960 --> 00:06:00.040
 months to shoot it for two hours of 

00:05:58.030 --> 00:06:01.630
 movie we had a lot of time with 

00:06:00.040 --> 00:06:03.250
 weeks when my character did not even 

00:06:01.630 --> 00:06:05.320
 he talked because he had to be focused on 

00:06:03.250 --> 00:06:07.680
 drive with less pressure as to 

00:06:05.320 --> 00:06:07.680
 say something
