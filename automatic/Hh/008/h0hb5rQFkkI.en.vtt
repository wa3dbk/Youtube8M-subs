the<00:02:00.910> that<00:02:01.420> fits<00:02:01.630> in<00:02:01.750> with<00:02:01.870> the<00:02:01.900> answer<00:02:02.230> in<00:02:02.290> the

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:02.410 
the that fits in with the answer in the

00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:04.200 
the that fits in with the answer in the
game<00:02:02.590> making<00:02:03.040> the<00:02:03.280> player<00:02:03.460> do<00:02:03.700> things<00:02:04.000> they

game making the player do things they

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:06.870 
game making the player do things they
wouldn't<00:02:04.240> normally<00:02:04.510> do<00:02:04.900> which<00:02:05.170> is<00:02:05.380> good<00:02:05.880> sound

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:06.880 
wouldn't normally do which is good sound

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:08.910 
wouldn't normally do which is good sound
I've<00:02:07.240> already<00:02:07.420> said<00:02:07.750> in<00:02:08.110> the<00:02:08.470> answer<00:02:08.770> is

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:08.920 
I've already said in the answer is

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:10.889 
I've already said in the answer is
really<00:02:09.160> good<00:02:09.369> things<00:02:09.700> you'll<00:02:10.000> hear<00:02:10.240> moaning

00:02:10.889 --> 00:02:10.899 
really good things you'll hear moaning

00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:13.680 
really good things you'll hear moaning
of<00:02:11.500> like<00:02:11.740> perhaps<00:02:12.460> survivors<00:02:13.270> or<00:02:13.420> are<00:02:13.540> they

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:13.690 
of like perhaps survivors or are they

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:16.710 
of like perhaps survivors or are they
necromorphs<00:02:14.410> you<00:02:15.010> know<00:02:15.160> know<00:02:15.510> you'll<00:02:16.510> hear

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:16.720 
necromorphs you know know you'll hear

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:19.350 
necromorphs you know know you'll hear
like<00:02:16.900> creaking<00:02:17.530> machinery<00:02:18.000> things<00:02:19.000> that

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:19.360 
like creaking machinery things that

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:21.810 
like creaking machinery things that
don't<00:02:19.570> sound<00:02:19.840> quite<00:02:20.260> natural<00:02:21.130> so<00:02:21.400> you<00:02:21.460> best

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:21.820 
don't sound quite natural so you best

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:23.400 
don't sound quite natural so you best
not<00:02:22.150> guess<00:02:22.480> what<00:02:22.600> they<00:02:22.810> are<00:02:22.960> because<00:02:23.110> it<00:02:23.320> will

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:23.410 
not guess what they are because it will

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:25.620 
not guess what they are because it will
probably<00:02:23.650> be<00:02:23.800> more<00:02:24.640> worried<00:02:25.060> than<00:02:25.090> you<00:02:25.390> are<00:02:25.510> at

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:28.410 
probably be more worried than you are at
the<00:02:25.720> current<00:02:26.050> moment<00:02:26.170> in<00:02:26.410> time<00:02:26.620> and<00:02:27.420> yeah

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:28.420 
the current moment in time and yeah

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:29.940 
the current moment in time and yeah
brilliant<00:02:28.900> sound<00:02:29.350> out<00:02:29.500> there<00:02:29.650> isn't<00:02:29.860> any

and everything music would really suit

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:35.340 
and everything music would really suit

multiple<00:04:40.300> objectives<00:04:40.450> and<00:04:41.200> you<00:04:41.470> usually<00:04:41.860> have

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:42.190 
multiple objectives and you usually have

00:04:42.190 --> 00:04:44.340 
multiple objectives and you usually have
a<00:04:42.220> choice<00:04:42.520> in<00:04:42.940> which<00:04:43.300> order<00:04:43.540> you<00:04:43.780> tackle<00:04:44.230> these

00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:44.350 
a choice in which order you tackle these

also why I should mention is the
antigravity<00:05:23.490> sections<00:05:24.180> of<00:05:24.300> the<00:05:24.390> game<00:05:24.600> they

00:05:25.220 --> 00:05:25.230 
antigravity sections of the game they

00:05:25.230 --> 00:05:28.070 
antigravity sections of the game they
work<00:05:25.500> really<00:05:25.830> well<00:05:26.630> seeing<00:05:27.630> as<00:05:27.720> how<00:05:27.840> you're<00:05:27.960> in

00:05:28.070 --> 00:05:28.080 
work really well seeing as how you're in

00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:30.140 
work really well seeing as how you're in
a<00:05:28.170> big<00:05:28.440> space<00:05:29.070> suit<00:05:29.460> sort<00:05:30.000> of

00:05:30.140 --> 00:05:30.150 
a big space suit sort of

00:05:30.150 --> 00:05:32.060 
a big space suit sort of
industrial-grade<00:05:30.990> thing<00:05:31.710> you've<00:05:31.890> got

00:05:32.060 --> 00:05:32.070 
industrial-grade thing you've got

00:05:32.070 --> 00:05:33.590 
industrial-grade thing you've got
magnetic<00:05:32.400> boots<00:05:32.790> so<00:05:33.120> when<00:05:33.270> you're<00:05:33.420> in<00:05:33.540> a

00:05:33.590 --> 00:05:33.600 
magnetic boots so when you're in a

00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:36.050 
magnetic boots so when you're in a
vacuum<00:05:33.810> you<00:05:34.740> you<00:05:35.130> basically<00:05:35.310> just<00:05:35.640> stick<00:05:35.970> to

00:05:36.050 --> 00:05:36.060 
vacuum you you basically just stick to

00:05:36.060 --> 00:05:37.610 
vacuum you you basically just stick to
anything<00:05:36.240> metal<00:05:36.540> which<00:05:36.840> hey<00:05:37.200> you're<00:05:37.500> on<00:05:37.590> a

00:05:37.610 --> 00:05:37.620 
anything metal which hey you're on a

00:05:37.620 --> 00:05:40.190 
anything metal which hey you're on a
ship<00:05:37.740> which<00:05:38.100> basically<00:05:38.610> means<00:05:38.850> everything<00:05:39.450> so

00:05:40.190 --> 00:05:40.200 
ship which basically means everything so

00:05:40.200 --> 00:05:41.540 
ship which basically means everything so
you<00:05:40.260> can<00:05:40.410> walk<00:05:40.530> on<00:05:40.560> walls<00:05:40.950> you<00:05:41.280> can<00:05:41.310> walk<00:05:41.520> on

00:05:41.540 --> 00:05:41.550 
you can walk on walls you can walk on

00:05:41.550 --> 00:05:43.220 
you can walk on walls you can walk on
the<00:05:41.730> ceiling<00:05:41.940> you<00:05:42.270> obviously<00:05:42.870> walk<00:05:42.990> on<00:05:43.140> the

00:05:43.220 --> 00:05:43.230 
the ceiling you obviously walk on the
