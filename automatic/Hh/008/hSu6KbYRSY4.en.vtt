00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:40.970 
these are ballpoint pen not rollerball
and<00:00:39.480> then<00:00:40.020> you<00:00:40.140> get<00:00:40.290> an<00:00:40.410> instruction<00:00:40.950> manual

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:40.980 
and then you get an instruction manual

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:43.760 
and then you get an instruction manual
and<00:00:41.370> a<00:00:41.430> cd-rom<00:00:41.820> that<00:00:42.360> has<00:00:43.050> you<00:00:43.739> know

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:43.770 
and a cd-rom that has you know

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:45.500 
and a cd-rom that has you know
information<00:00:44.190> and<00:00:44.700> software<00:00:44.879> on<00:00:45.239> it<00:00:45.360> and<00:00:45.450> I'm

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
information and software on it and I'm

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:47.270 
information and software on it and I'm
going<00:00:45.600> to<00:00:45.690> talk<00:00:45.809> about<00:00:45.930> this<00:00:46.170> in<00:00:46.320> a<00:00:46.410> second<00:00:46.770> so

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280 
going to talk about this in a second so

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:48.290 
going to talk about this in a second so
let<00:00:47.399> me<00:00:47.460> get<00:00:47.579> everything<00:00:47.789> out<00:00:47.969> of<00:00:48.030> the<00:00:48.149> way

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300 
let me get everything out of the way

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:49.700 
let me get everything out of the way
because<00:00:48.480> it<00:00:48.690> really<00:00:48.870> don't<00:00:49.020> need<00:00:49.170> to<00:00:49.260> focus<00:00:49.410> in

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
because it really don't need to focus in

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:52.610 
because it really don't need to focus in
on<00:00:50.010> anything<00:00:50.480> except<00:00:51.480> the<00:00:51.660> pen<00:00:51.870> cam<00:00:52.170> itself

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
on anything except the pen cam itself

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:54.799 
on anything except the pen cam itself
and<00:00:52.860> this<00:00:52.920> is<00:00:53.100> it<00:00:53.250> and<00:00:53.460> essentially<00:00:54.239> what<00:00:54.629> this

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
and this is it and essentially what this

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:56.180 
and this is it and essentially what this
is<00:00:54.870> is<00:00:55.050> a<00:00:55.230> ballpoint<00:00:55.860> pen

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
is is a ballpoint pen

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:59.959 
is is a ballpoint pen
with<00:00:56.850> a<00:00:56.879> hidden<00:00:57.329> camera<00:00:57.739> inside<00:00:58.739> so<00:00:59.520> there<00:00:59.820> is

00:00:59.959 --> 00:00:59.969 
with a hidden camera inside so there is

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:02.209 
with a hidden camera inside so there is
the<00:01:00.120> ballpoint<00:01:00.510> pen<00:01:00.809> I<00:01:01.079> will<00:01:01.590> show<00:01:01.829> you<00:01:01.890> that

00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:02.219 
the ballpoint pen I will show you that

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:05.299 
the ballpoint pen I will show you that
it<00:01:02.579> does<00:01:02.820> actually<00:01:03.180> write<00:01:03.690> so<00:01:04.159> let's<00:01:05.159> see<00:01:05.280> I

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
it does actually write so let's see I

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:07.010 
it does actually write so let's see I
can't<00:01:05.580> do<00:01:05.670> it<00:01:05.790> on<00:01:05.850> this<00:01:06.000> waxy<00:01:06.479> part<00:01:06.720> of<00:01:06.780> the<00:01:06.840> box

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
can't do it on this waxy part of the box

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:09.440 
can't do it on this waxy part of the box
let's<00:01:07.260> see<00:01:07.439> now<00:01:07.979> there<00:01:08.580> we<00:01:08.670> go<00:01:08.790> the<00:01:08.939> box<00:01:09.150> does

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450 
let's see now there we go the box does

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:10.850 
let's see now there we go the box does
allow<00:01:09.720> me<00:01:09.869> to<00:01:09.960> write<00:01:10.110> on<00:01:10.260> it<00:01:10.290> so<00:01:10.470> you<00:01:10.560> can<00:01:10.590> see

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
allow me to write on it so you can see

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:12.590 
allow me to write on it so you can see
that<00:01:11.369> it<00:01:11.520> does<00:01:11.670> allow<00:01:11.820> me<00:01:11.939> to<00:01:12.150> write<00:01:12.330> like<00:01:12.570> a

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
that it does allow me to write like a

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:14.690 
that it does allow me to write like a
regular<00:01:12.900> pen<00:01:13.439> let's<00:01:14.040> hit<00:01:14.250> it<00:01:14.310> in<00:01:14.490> there<00:01:14.640> and

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
regular pen let's hit it in there and

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:16.070 
regular pen let's hit it in there and
that's<00:01:14.790> why<00:01:14.970> you<00:01:15.030> get<00:01:15.180> the<00:01:15.270> extra<00:01:15.509> ballpoint

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 
that's why you get the extra ballpoint

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:18.260 
that's why you get the extra ballpoint
refills<00:01:16.500> but<00:01:16.830> where<00:01:17.310> this<00:01:17.490> thing<00:01:17.939> really

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270 
refills but where this thing really

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:21.230 
refills but where this thing really
comes<00:01:18.840> in<00:01:19.049> handy<00:01:19.080> is<00:01:19.560> the<00:01:19.770> hidden<00:01:20.189> camera<00:01:20.700> that

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
comes in handy is the hidden camera that

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:23.719 
comes in handy is the hidden camera that
it<00:01:21.360> features<00:01:21.479> so<00:01:21.930> right<00:01:22.470> there<00:01:22.680> above<00:01:23.009> the<00:01:23.070> pen

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729 
it features so right there above the pen

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:26.330 
it features so right there above the pen
clip<00:01:24.090> right<00:01:24.570> there<00:01:24.840> is<00:01:25.020> the<00:01:25.650> camera<00:01:26.130> lens

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340

clip right there is the camera lens
where<00:01:26.700> it<00:01:26.759> says<00:01:26.939> a<00:01:27.150> gig<00:01:27.420> which<00:01:27.570> you<00:01:27.689> probably

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
where it says a gig which you probably

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:29.600 
where it says a gig which you probably
want<00:01:28.049> to<00:01:28.080> peel<00:01:28.320> off<00:01:28.530> and<00:01:28.860> then<00:01:29.250> on<00:01:29.340> the<00:01:29.460> back

in conjunction with a wall adapter or
just<00:01:55.530> plug<00:01:55.740> this<00:01:55.890> right<00:01:56.100> into<00:01:56.250> a<00:01:56.369> USB<00:01:56.790> port<00:01:57.090> on

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:57.210 
just plug this right into a USB port on

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:58.789 
just plug this right into a USB port on
your<00:01:57.299> computer<00:01:57.689> like<00:01:58.079> you<00:01:58.229> would<00:01:58.439> a<00:01:58.469> thumb

00:01:58.789 --> 00:01:58.799 
your computer like you would a thumb

00:01:58.799 --> 00:01:59.240 
your computer like you would a thumb
drive

00:01:59.240 --> 00:01:59.250 
drive

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:00.950 
drive
there<00:01:59.610> is<00:01:59.700> a<00:01:59.729> selector<00:02:00.329> switch<00:02:00.360> right<00:02:00.930> there

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:00.960 
there is a selector switch right there

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:02.690 
there is a selector switch right there
which<00:02:01.469> is<00:02:01.590> kind<00:02:01.770> of<00:02:01.890> hard<00:02:02.070> to<00:02:02.130> see<00:02:02.369> it's<00:02:02.549> rather

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:02.700 
which is kind of hard to see it's rather

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:04.370 
which is kind of hard to see it's rather
small<00:02:03.119> but<00:02:03.630> essentially<00:02:04.140> when<00:02:04.290> you're

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:04.380 
small but essentially when you're

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:06.080 
small but essentially when you're
looking<00:02:04.680> at<00:02:04.829> it<00:02:04.860> this<00:02:05.040> way<00:02:05.250> to<00:02:05.310> the<00:02:05.610> left<00:02:05.790> is

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:06.090 
looking at it this way to the left is

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:09.290 
looking at it this way to the left is
the<00:02:06.869> video<00:02:07.590> mode<00:02:07.920> and<00:02:07.979> to<00:02:08.399> the<00:02:08.520> right<00:02:08.729> is<00:02:08.970> steel

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:09.300 
the video mode and to the right is steel

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:11.600 
the video mode and to the right is steel
still<00:02:09.750> images<00:02:10.229> so<00:02:10.739> this<00:02:10.920> thing<00:02:11.099> will<00:02:11.220> record

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:11.610 
still images so this thing will record

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:14.040 
still images so this thing will record
both<00:02:11.670> 720<00:02:12.569> HD<00:02:13.260> video

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:14.050 
both 720 HD video

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:16.290 
both 720 HD video
as<00:02:14.110> well<00:02:14.290> as<00:02:14.500> high-resolution<00:02:15.340> still<00:02:15.730> images

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:16.300 
as well as high-resolution still images

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:20.190 
as well as high-resolution still images
so<00:02:16.900> once<00:02:17.200> you<00:02:17.320> have<00:02:17.470> it<00:02:17.620> all<00:02:17.740> together<00:02:19.200> screw

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:20.200 
so once you have it all together screw

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:21.720 
so once you have it all together screw
it<00:02:20.290> back<00:02:20.410> together<00:02:20.560> what<00:02:21.220> you're<00:02:21.340> meant<00:02:21.490> to<00:02:21.580> do

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:21.730 
it back together what you're meant to do

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:23.280 
it back together what you're meant to do
is<00:02:21.880> hold<00:02:22.090> down<00:02:22.270> the<00:02:22.390> power<00:02:22.570> button<00:02:22.660> now<00:02:23.020> I<00:02:23.050> had

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:23.290 
is hold down the power button now I had

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:25.770 
is hold down the power button now I had
some<00:02:23.470> issues<00:02:23.650> with<00:02:24.040> this<00:02:24.220> getting<00:02:24.520> it<00:02:24.700> to<00:02:24.820> work

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:25.780 
some issues with this getting it to work

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:26.940 
some issues with this getting it to work
you're<00:02:25.990> meant<00:02:26.140> to<00:02:26.200> hold<00:02:26.440> down<00:02:26.530> this<00:02:26.710> button

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:26.950 
you're meant to hold down this button

went<00:02:49.060> into<00:02:49.570> standby<00:02:50.080> mode<00:02:50.340> so<00:02:51.340> kind<00:02:51.730> of<00:02:51.820> an<00:02:51.940> odd

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:52.420 
went into standby mode so kind of an odd

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:54.960 
went into standby mode so kind of an odd
thing<00:02:52.780> I<00:02:52.930> tried<00:02:53.170> two<00:02:53.440> of<00:02:53.590> these<00:02:53.680> units<00:02:54.130> both<00:02:54.790> of

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:54.970 
thing I tried two of these units both of

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:56.700 
thing I tried two of these units both of
them<00:02:55.090> gave<00:02:55.240> me<00:02:55.390> the<00:02:55.510> same<00:02:55.720> exact<00:02:56.230> issue<00:02:56.440> where

00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:56.710 
them gave me the same exact issue where

00:02:56.710 --> 00:02:58.260 
them gave me the same exact issue where
I<00:02:56.740> could<00:02:57.010> not<00:02:57.160> get<00:02:57.400> it<00:02:57.520> to<00:02:57.580> go<00:02:57.700> in<00:02:57.790> the<00:02:57.880> standby

00:02:58.260 --> 00:02:58.270 
I could not get it to go in the standby

00:02:58.270 --> 00:03:00.360 
I could not get it to go in the standby
mode<00:02:58.480> the<00:02:58.960> right<00:02:59.140> way<00:02:59.320> and<00:02:59.590> the<00:02:59.950> bigger<00:03:00.130> issue

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:00.370 
mode the right way and the bigger issue

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:02.610 
mode the right way and the bigger issue
or<00:03:00.640> more<00:03:01.030> importantly<00:03:01.420> now<00:03:01.660> once<00:03:02.290> it's<00:03:02.470> in

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:02.620 
or more importantly now once it's in

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:04.680 
or more importantly now once it's in
standby<00:03:03.010> mode<00:03:03.100> which<00:03:03.520> it<00:03:03.670> is<00:03:03.820> I<00:03:04.060> could<00:03:04.510> never

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:04.690 
standby mode which it is I could never

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:07.320 
standby mode which it is I could never
get<00:03:04.870> this<00:03:05.050> to<00:03:05.260> turn<00:03:05.410> off<00:03:05.680> so<00:03:06.340> the<00:03:07.000> only<00:03:07.120> thing<00:03:07.240> I

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:07.330 
get this to turn off so the only thing I

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:08.850 
get this to turn off so the only thing I
can<00:03:07.510> do<00:03:07.630> is<00:03:07.900> get<00:03:08.140> it<00:03:08.260> to<00:03:08.350> start<00:03:08.620> recording

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:08.860 
can do is get it to start recording

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:11.220 
can do is get it to start recording
video<00:03:09.250> which<00:03:09.520> you<00:03:09.970> do<00:03:10.120> by<00:03:10.300> pressing<00:03:10.810> the

video which you do by pressing the

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:13.050 
video which you do by pressing the
button<00:03:11.650> right<00:03:11.860> there<00:03:11.920> and<00:03:12.460> now<00:03:12.820> you'll<00:03:12.970> see

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:13.060 
button right there and now you'll see

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:15.420 
button right there and now you'll see
this<00:03:13.300> blue<00:03:13.540> light<00:03:13.840> start<00:03:14.260> to<00:03:14.380> blink<00:03:14.740> I<00:03:15.040> don't

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:15.430 
this blue light start to blink I don't

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:16.530 
this blue light start to blink I don't
know<00:03:15.490> if<00:03:15.580> you<00:03:15.670> can<00:03:15.790> make<00:03:15.820> that<00:03:15.970> out<00:03:16.150> hopefully
