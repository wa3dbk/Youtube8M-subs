00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.470
 aica brothers of minecraft ita mod io 

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:07.049
 I am a piece and today I am here for 

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:10.110
 present the gravity gun mod 

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:11.849
 let's start immediately but let's go straight to 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:14.429
 see what this new introduces us 

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:16.800
 fashion this new fashion introduces us to two 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:19.650
 new items the gravity gun that you 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:21.570
 divide into two species say the 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:24.920
 normal gravity gun and the gravity gun 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:27.990
 super charge the gravity gun is normal 

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:30.269
 let me click so you see better the 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:33.500
 gravity gun normal seacraft with a 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:37.380
 diamond an obsidian two pieces of iron 

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:40.230
 4 pearl ender is a stone this corner 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:43.379
 gravity gun will be less in the push 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:44.969
 let's say our item will be less 

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:47.309
 powerful than that given by the super 

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:50.550
 meanwhile we need to use it 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:52.890
 right click on a 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:55.170
 any theme we want to shoot and 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:58.020
 then clicking the left button it 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:59.850
 will launch far this works too 

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:03.619
 for there for the mob now I'll do it for you 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:05.700
 see then niamey perfect mode 

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:08.130
 use ok 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:09.689
 we take I do n't know any bike can 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:10.619
 take zombies again let's say it 

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:12.960
 zombie 

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:15.090
 we always take the zombie with the button 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:15.900
 right and then we shoot it with the button 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:18.900
 left 

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:21.810
 same thing for all the mods then there was 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:25.740
 instead the super church the super cierge a 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:30.090
 the ned airstar in the middle an obsidian a 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:32.549
 diamond two iron ingot and four under 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:34.259
 byrne with this instead we can 

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:37.439
 launch it much, much further 

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:40.320
 look, I think it has arrived 

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:42.780
 even the fact now we try 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:45.030
 then let's try to launch towards this 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:47.070
 We use the distance of his first 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:49.090
 normal and we shoot it straight at us 

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:53.200
 let's see where it comes from 

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:59.880
 ok we see it therefore must be 

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:59.880
 arrived around this area 

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:04.170
 I know he went down there I don't know 

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:05.450
 well then still got there instead 

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:07.470
 the other arrived directly 

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:09.330
 on the tree so a little further away 

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:10.500
 however I show you the difference 

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:16.050
 one arrived the app 

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:19.560
 we also shoot this central 

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:22.920
 look you have seen that you too 

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:24.900
 this one had come down here at the beginning here 

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:26.490
 this part the other is from had already gone 

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:28.770
 on the other side look here 

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:32.070
 even then guys a mod 

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:34.470
 really useful let's say for survival 

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:36.780
 maybe you haven't managed to do 

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:40.290
 get a pig where you want it 

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:42.090
 carry around with this one with this 

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:43.650
 fashion and take it where you want 

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:45.840
 logically not all items yes 

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:48.150
 attack for example first spear ho 

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:50.460
 tried to launch as you saw the 

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:52.890
 Stone stuck there instead see 

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:56.310
 then the earth sticks immediately 

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:58.110
 this fashion does not apply to all types of 

00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:59.670
 blocks for example on the leaves you see 

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:03.390
 that does not take them 

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:05.730
 or you only see on the blocks like 

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:07.800
 the earth the stone and things like that 

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:09.209
 so guys this is all that 

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:10.770
 introduces us this new fashion 

00:03:09.209 --> 00:03:13.320
 I remind you to put it like 

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:15.209
 subscribe to the channel and 30 like it 

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:16.410

00:03:15.209 --> 00:03:17.700

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:20.239
