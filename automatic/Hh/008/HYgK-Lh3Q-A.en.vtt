00:01:02.649 --> 00:01:02.659 
realize what gun is better than another

00:01:02.659 --> 00:01:03.910 
realize what gun is better than another
because<00:01:02.780> they<00:01:02.930> all<00:01:03.019> seem<00:01:03.290> to<00:01:03.320> kill<00:01:03.589> the<00:01:03.739> same

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:03.920 
because they all seem to kill the same

like the very fast eye you know all guns

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:08.350 
like the very fast eye you know all guns
kill<00:01:06.530> very<00:01:06.710> fast<00:01:06.979> but<00:01:07.520> in<00:01:07.610> this<00:01:07.729> gun<00:01:07.909> you<00:01:08.060> can

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:08.360 
kill very fast but in this gun you can

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:11.830 
kill very fast but in this gun you can
kind<00:01:08.720> of<00:01:08.979> you<00:01:09.979> can<00:01:10.100> kind<00:01:10.250> of<00:01:10.310> figure<00:01:10.460> out<00:01:10.840> or

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:11.840 
kind of you can kind of figure out or

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:13.719 
kind of you can kind of figure out or
you<00:01:11.960> can<00:01:12.080> kind<00:01:12.260> of<00:01:12.320> see<00:01:12.680> and<00:01:12.920> notice<00:01:13.430> the

and how to use it so of course if you're
going<00:01:21.650> with<00:01:21.740> the<00:01:21.860> chem<00:01:22.040> strike<00:01:22.340> class<00:01:22.790> it<00:01:23.000> up

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:23.090 
going with the chem strike class it up

gonna notice the the or how you know it

00:01:52.729 --> 00:01:55.000 
gonna notice the the or how you know it
kills<00:01:53.240> slower<00:01:53.659> soon<00:01:53.960> it's<00:01:54.229> gonna<00:01:54.350> help<00:01:54.650> kill

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:55.010 
kills slower soon it's gonna help kill

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:57.219 
kills slower soon it's gonna help kill
faster<00:01:55.520> basically<00:01:55.970> and<00:01:56.750> it's<00:01:56.870> gonna<00:01:56.960> make<00:01:57.140> the

00:01:57.219 --> 00:01:57.229 
faster basically and it's gonna make the

00:01:57.229 --> 00:01:59.440 
faster basically and it's gonna make the
gun<00:01:57.380> a<00:01:57.409> little<00:01:57.500> more<00:01:57.710> effective<00:01:58.190> now<00:01:58.700> this<00:01:59.300> gun

00:01:59.440 --> 00:01:59.450 
gun a little more effective now this gun

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:00.880 
gun a little more effective now this gun
does<00:01:59.630> have<00:01:59.780> a<00:01:59.840> little<00:02:00.020> bit<00:02:00.110> of<00:02:00.200> recoil<00:02:00.590> you're

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:00.890 
does have a little bit of recoil you're

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:03.070 
does have a little bit of recoil you're
not<00:02:01.040> gonna<00:02:01.330> want<00:02:02.330> to<00:02:02.450> have<00:02:02.600> that<00:02:02.840> so<00:02:03.050> I

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:03.080 
not gonna want to have that so I

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:04.870 
not gonna want to have that so I
definitely<00:02:03.470> recommend<00:02:03.979> using<00:02:04.250> the<00:02:04.430> foregrip

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:04.880 
definitely recommend using the foregrip

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:06.250 
definitely recommend using the foregrip
which<00:02:05.090> is<00:02:05.210> an<00:02:05.300> under<00:02:05.600> barrel<00:02:05.870> it's<00:02:05.990> gonna<00:02:06.080> make

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:06.260 
which is an under barrel it's gonna make

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:08.979 
which is an under barrel it's gonna make
this<00:02:06.380> gun<00:02:06.590> be<00:02:06.950> a<00:02:06.979> lot<00:02:07.460> more<00:02:07.940> accurate<00:02:08.569> it's

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:08.989 
this gun be a lot more accurate it's

00:02:08.989 --> 00:02:11.199 
this gun be a lot more accurate it's
gonna<00:02:09.080> make<00:02:09.289> the<00:02:09.409> gun<00:02:09.530> better<00:02:09.799> and<00:02:10.099> you're<00:02:10.879> not

00:02:11.199 --> 00:02:11.209 
gonna make the gun better and you're not

00:02:11.209 --> 00:02:11.949 
gonna make the gun better and you're not
gonna<00:02:11.299> have<00:02:11.420> to<00:02:11.480> worry<00:02:11.659> about<00:02:11.810> that

00:02:11.949 --> 00:02:11.959 
gonna have to worry about that

00:02:11.959 --> 00:02:14.710 
gonna have to worry about that
long-range<00:02:12.680> long<00:02:13.040> distance<00:02:13.580> recoil<00:02:14.450> at<00:02:14.569> this

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:14.720 
long-range long distance recoil at this

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:17.289 
long-range long distance recoil at this
gun<00:02:14.900> just<00:02:15.080> automatically<00:02:15.650> comes<00:02:15.980> with<00:02:16.250> so<00:02:17.209> you

00:02:17.289 --> 00:02:17.299 
gun just automatically comes with so you

00:02:17.299 --> 00:02:19.410 
gun just automatically comes with so you
just<00:02:17.659> throw<00:02:17.810> that<00:02:18.050> on<00:02:18.080> there<00:02:18.350> that's<00:02:18.530> just<00:02:18.620> a

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:19.420 
just throw that on there that's just a

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:21.589 
just throw that on there that's just a
necessary<00:02:20.420> attachment<00:02:21.050> that<00:02:21.110> you<00:02:21.170> got

00:02:21.589 --> 00:02:21.599

00:02:23.899 --> 00:02:23.909 
have on there and like I said switch

00:02:23.909 --> 00:02:25.190 
have on there and like I said switch
between<00:02:24.180> the<00:02:24.269> muzzle<00:02:24.599> brake<00:02:24.780> or<00:02:24.989> these

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:25.200 
between the muzzle brake or these

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:27.199 
between the muzzle brake or these
silencer<00:02:25.680> either<00:02:25.920> one<00:02:26.219> works<00:02:26.489> but<00:02:26.849> the<00:02:26.939> muzzle

00:02:27.199 --> 00:02:27.209 
silencer either one works but the muzzle

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:28.489 
silencer either one works but the muzzle
brake<00:02:27.389> remember<00:02:27.749> is<00:02:27.840> going<00:02:27.989> to<00:02:28.139> make<00:02:28.349> that

00:02:28.489 --> 00:02:28.499 
brake remember is going to make that

00:02:28.499 --> 00:02:31.280 
brake remember is going to make that
damage<00:02:28.920> much<00:02:29.340> better<00:02:29.819> it<00:02:30.659> says<00:02:30.870> it<00:02:30.989> only<00:02:31.109> goes
