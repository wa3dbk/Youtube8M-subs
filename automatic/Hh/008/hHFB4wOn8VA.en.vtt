00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010 
so we're going to begin with using the

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:52.310 
so we're going to begin with using the
label<00:00:50.370> MC<00:00:50.700> salt<00:00:51.030> this<00:00:51.510> is<00:00:51.690> going<00:00:51.870> to<00:00:51.930> allow<00:00:52.140> us

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320 
label MC salt this is going to allow us

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:55.160 
label MC salt this is going to allow us
to<00:00:52.410> create<00:00:52.710> texture<00:00:53.100> by<00:00:53.670> applying<00:00:54.059> a<00:00:54.750> generous

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170 
to create texture by applying a generous

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:57.170 
to create texture by applying a generous
amount<00:00:55.680> throughout<00:00:56.190> the<00:00:56.340> hair<00:00:56.520> will<00:00:56.670> allow<00:00:56.940> us

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 
amount throughout the hair will allow us

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:59.900 
amount throughout the hair will allow us
to<00:00:57.210> create<00:00:57.690> texture<00:00:58.410> as<00:00:58.920> we<00:00:59.070> begin<00:00:59.370> to<00:00:59.550> dry<00:00:59.789> off

00:00:59.900 --> 00:00:59.910 
to create texture as we begin to dry off

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:01.910 
to create texture as we begin to dry off
the<00:01:00.090> hair<00:01:00.329> why<00:01:00.870> this<00:01:00.930> is<00:01:01.199> important<00:01:01.770> is

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
the hair why this is important is

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:04.399 
the hair why this is important is
because<00:01:01.949> it's<00:01:02.699> a<00:01:02.789> create<00:01:03.090> product<00:01:03.510> it<00:01:04.080> allows

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:04.409 
because it's a create product it allows

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:07.460 
because it's a create product it allows
the<00:01:04.650> finishing<00:01:05.250> to<00:01:05.909> last<00:01:06.450> longer<00:01:06.780> so<00:01:07.140> this

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470 
the finishing to last longer so this

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:11.090 
the finishing to last longer so this
texture<00:01:08.100> will<00:01:09.090> be<00:01:09.119> seen<00:01:09.540> a<00:01:09.570> lot<00:01:09.869> more<00:01:09.900> which<00:01:10.650> is

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100 
texture will be seen a lot more which is

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:20.830 
texture will be seen a lot more which is
why<00:01:11.820> through<00:01:12.240> the<00:01:12.450> time

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:20.840 

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:23.539 

okay<00:01:21.840> so<00:01:21.900> as<00:01:22.110> you<00:01:22.200> can<00:01:22.380> see<00:01:22.560> I've<00:01:22.770> dried<00:01:23.010> off<00:01:23.280> by

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:23.549 
okay so as you can see I've dried off by

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:26.060 
okay so as you can see I've dried off by
using<00:01:23.760> the<00:01:24.030> small<00:01:24.420> label<00:01:25.170> end<00:01:25.320> and<00:01:25.619> a<00:01:25.799> brush

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.070 
using the small label end and a brush

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:27.920 
using the small label end and a brush
and<00:01:26.640> it<00:01:26.820> allowed<00:01:27.119> us<00:01:27.150> to<00:01:27.330> create<00:01:27.630> a<00:01:27.780> lot<00:01:27.810> more

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
and it allowed us to create a lot more

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:30.260 
and it allowed us to create a lot more
smoothness<00:01:28.440> and<00:01:29.100> now<00:01:29.310> with<00:01:29.520> the<00:01:29.670> seesaw<00:01:30.119> you

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
smoothness and now with the seesaw you

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:32.180 
smoothness and now with the seesaw you
can<00:01:30.420> see<00:01:30.750> that<00:01:31.200> the<00:01:31.290> textures<00:01:31.770> a<00:01:31.799> lot<00:01:31.979> more

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:32.190 
can see that the textures a lot more

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:34.520 
can see that the textures a lot more
controllable<00:01:32.750> we're<00:01:33.750> gonna<00:01:33.840> apply<00:01:34.200> some<00:01:34.500> of

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530 
controllable we're gonna apply some of

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:54.350 
controllable we're gonna apply some of
the<00:01:34.830> label<00:01:35.520> em<00:01:38.060> with<00:01:52.610> these<00:01:53.610> products

00:02:02.119 --> 00:02:05.719 

really<00:02:03.119> to<00:02:03.270> accentuate<00:02:03.770> the<00:02:04.770> texture<00:02:05.340> and<00:02:05.580> the

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:05.729 
really to accentuate the texture and the

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:08.449 
really to accentuate the texture and the
shape<00:02:06.030> but<00:02:06.780> also<00:02:06.960> having<00:02:07.800> a<00:02:07.860> little<00:02:08.130> flatter

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:10.649 
through the front we're just gonna work

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:12.650 
through the front we're just gonna work
that<00:02:10.890> through<00:02:11.190> all<00:02:11.910> the<00:02:12.060> way<00:02:12.180> through<00:02:12.209> this
