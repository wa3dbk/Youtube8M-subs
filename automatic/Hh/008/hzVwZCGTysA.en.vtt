00:00:14.020 --> 00:00:22.000
 I'm going to make an omelet again 

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:25.700

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:28.450
 profile of I have a little 

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:28.450
 tender garlic 

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:34.160
 and whole garlic 

00:00:31.010 --> 00:00:37.130
 I have frozen the prawns here 

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:39.410
 and peeled the same first I'll put to brown 

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:41.540
 in the pan is four cloves of garlic 

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:45.660
 that I sugar with the palm of my finger 

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:48.390
 they peel them on over shocked the dollars 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:51.950
 I'll take it to the side and I'll also give 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:54.230
 the prawns that are already cooked 

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:57.320
 if you drop in juice it will also allow me 

00:00:54.230 --> 00:01:00.620
 do it all ready and I'll use 

00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:04.840
 three eggs three eggs that beat salt 

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:10.040
 pepper and after that this excess of 

00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:11.430
 so I'll add the garlic 

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:15.060

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:18.479

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:23.220
 shakes and parsley and with a pan 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:25.470
 because in this opportunity it will be more 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:26.370
 It's great to flip it with the help of a 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:29.820
 plate 

00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:32.480
 hands to work is to treat both the day 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:32.480
 of prawns 

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:38.950
 I wanted to stop this video 

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:38.950
 to teach in the famous of both 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:45.119
 they look like those jungle worms 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:48.370
 I do not remember how they are called correct 

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:50.210
 the pacifiers colleges 

00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:54.770
 I do not remember 

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:56.659
 these prawns will go after browning these 

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:59.659
 garlic that is crushed that he wanted it 

00:01:56.659 --> 00:02:02.010
 teach with the palm of my hand that 

00:01:59.659 --> 00:02:06.530
 will help first 

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:06.530
 appeal it and second then 

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:12.300
 give flavor to that olive oil another 

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:14.819
 I wanted to show them the garlic that was 

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:17.519
 They look a lot like the Chinese onion 

00:02:14.819 --> 00:02:20.549
 by the head and the length of its leaves 

00:02:17.519 --> 00:02:23.189
 and I will use a bit of this package this 

00:02:20.549 --> 00:02:24.989
 tray containing 100 grams of garlic 

00:02:23.189 --> 00:02:28.730
 tender and I will use a little and here I have 

00:02:24.989 --> 00:02:28.730
 Chopped parsley 

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:36.600
 good 

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:39.340
 very short 

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:45.959
 what happens is that I do not want 

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:49.340
 the normal ingredients of 

00:02:45.959 --> 00:02:49.340
 an ethical tortilla more 

00:02:56.030 --> 00:03:01.380
 of salt and pepper that has this 

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:05.690
 tortilla I add the chopped parsley 

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:05.690
 and then the tender garlic 

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:11.710
 well here in our pan 

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:15.780
 already warming 

00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:15.780
 we add olive oil 

00:03:16.569 --> 00:03:20.879
 they say that the virgin I do not know 

00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:25.770
 crushed 

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:38.670
 as oil 

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:42.790
 but what family 

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:16.659
 and I come 

00:04:17.790 --> 00:04:20.300
 tender garlic 

00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:38.610
 in this recipe step by step with the 

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:40.650
 colour 

00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:43.189
 remember that I will throw the pepper found 

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:43.189
 in the body 

00:04:43.510 --> 00:04:47.130
 and let's let that 

00:04:56.080 --> 00:05:01.710
 release the juice 

00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:01.710
 is that cube that you 

00:05:02.370 --> 00:05:08.360
 to evaporate to add 

00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:10.540
 while I prawns are drying in the 

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:15.030
 skillet 

00:05:10.540 --> 00:05:15.030
 here I have milk and yeast 

00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:26.810
 strong 

00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:26.810
 but the flavor is still 

00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:43.450
 what he said is very similar to the south and 

00:05:38.380 --> 00:05:46.780

00:05:43.450 --> 00:05:51.330

 efe as of themselves 

00:06:00.330 --> 00:06:04.610
 and 

00:06:02.040 --> 00:06:09.400
 and that you start cooking 

00:06:04.610 --> 00:06:13.169
 this shrimp omelette with garlic parsley 

00:06:09.400 --> 00:06:13.169
 it's getting more fluffy 

00:06:13.250 --> 00:06:20.300
 as spongy insurance 

00:06:16.470 --> 00:06:20.300
 the bottom part is cooking 

00:06:21.660 --> 00:06:25.670
 of slope and the animal 

00:06:29.910 --> 00:06:34.890
 a bigger pot 

00:06:32.910 --> 00:06:37.190
 this dish did not bench me he sat on the 

00:06:34.890 --> 00:06:37.190

00:06:53.310 --> 00:06:56.639
 I succeeded 

00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:04.150
 it's not a matter of doing it at home 

00:06:59.720 --> 00:07:06.100
 and another thing is to do it in life 

00:07:04.150 --> 00:07:08.380

00:07:06.100 --> 00:07:11.370
