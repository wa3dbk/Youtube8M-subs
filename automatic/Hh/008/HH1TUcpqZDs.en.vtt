00:01:53.639 --> 00:01:53.649 
these are just like extras I guess this

00:01:53.649 --> 00:01:55.770 
these are just like extras I guess this
was<00:01:53.829> an<00:01:54.009> xbox<00:01:54.429> 360<00:01:54.969> chat<00:01:55.179> cables<00:01:55.569> so<00:01:55.689> we'll

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:55.780 
was an xbox 360 chat cables so we'll

00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:59.039 
was an xbox 360 chat cables so we'll
throw<00:01:55.990> that<00:01:56.200> in<00:01:56.350> there<00:01:56.439> as<00:01:56.619> well<00:01:57.149> and<00:01:58.149> then

00:01:59.039 --> 00:01:59.049 
throw that in there as well and then

00:01:59.049 --> 00:02:01.050 
throw that in there as well and then
this<00:01:59.289> is<00:01:59.439> obviously<00:01:59.590> a<00:01:59.920> splitter<00:02:00.340> and<00:02:00.460> then<00:02:00.819> I

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:01.060 
this is obviously a splitter and then I

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:02.789 
this is obviously a splitter and then I
think<00:02:01.210> this<00:02:01.450> is<00:02:01.630> just<00:02:01.840> a<00:02:01.929> regular<00:02:02.109> auxiliary

00:02:02.789 --> 00:02:02.799 
think this is just a regular auxiliary

00:02:02.799 --> 00:02:04.649 
think this is just a regular auxiliary
cord<00:02:03.069> so<00:02:03.369> you<00:02:03.759> have<00:02:03.880> everything<00:02:04.359> you're

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:04.659 
cord so you have everything you're

00:02:04.659 --> 00:02:06.510 
cord so you have everything you're
getting<00:02:04.959> a<00:02:05.049> 200<00:02:05.619> I<00:02:05.679> think<00:02:05.859> these<00:02:05.950> are<00:02:06.009> this<00:02:06.369> is

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:06.520 
getting a 200 I think these are this is

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:08.999 
getting a 200 I think these are this is
two<00:02:06.670> hundred<00:02:06.700> and<00:02:06.969> fifty<00:02:07.119> dollars<00:02:07.770> retail<00:02:08.770> and

00:02:08.999 --> 00:02:09.009 
two hundred and fifty dollars retail and

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:10.380
