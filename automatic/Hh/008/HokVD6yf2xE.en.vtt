okay just a quick assembly video for my
xbox<00:00:04.140> controller<00:00:04.799> trigger<00:00:05.520> extender<00:00:06.049> I've

00:00:07.039 --> 00:00:07.049 
xbox controller trigger extender I've

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:11.030 
xbox controller trigger extender I've
got<00:00:07.259> all<00:00:07.350> the<00:00:07.440> parts<00:00:07.470> printed<00:00:08.280> out<00:00:08.429> here<00:00:10.040> take

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:11.040 
got all the parts printed out here take

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:14.089 
got all the parts printed out here take
the<00:00:11.190> trigger<00:00:11.460> and<00:00:11.639> the<00:00:11.700> button<00:00:12.860> place<00:00:13.860> them

00:00:14.089 --> 00:00:14.099 
the trigger and the button place them

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:16.970 
the trigger and the button place them
together<00:00:14.219> I<00:00:15.410> should<00:00:16.410> have<00:00:16.500> already<00:00:16.650> drilled

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:16.980 
together I should have already drilled

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:19.790 
together I should have already drilled
out<00:00:17.160> all<00:00:17.310> these<00:00:17.490> holes<00:00:18.199> do<00:00:19.199> not<00:00:19.380> drill<00:00:19.650> out<00:00:19.770> the

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:19.800 
out all these holes do not drill out the

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:21.920 
out all these holes do not drill out the
holes<00:00:19.920> in<00:00:20.250> the<00:00:20.369> mount<00:00:20.580> it's<00:00:21.510> this<00:00:21.689> bigger

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:21.930 
holes in the mount it's this bigger

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:30.019 
holes in the mount it's this bigger
piece<00:00:24.800> and<00:00:25.800> start<00:00:27.890> the<00:00:28.890> assembly<00:00:29.160> like<00:00:29.730> so

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:30.029 
piece and start the assembly like so

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:33.410 
piece and start the assembly like so
it'll<00:00:30.720> be<00:00:30.750> the<00:00:30.929> same<00:00:31.140> on<00:00:31.289> the<00:00:31.410> other<00:00:31.470> side<00:00:32.420> now

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:33.420 
it'll be the same on the other side now

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:38.209 
it'll be the same on the other side now
this<00:00:33.719> has<00:00:33.930> a<00:00:33.960> little<00:00:36.710> little<00:00:37.710> tab<00:00:37.920> right<00:00:38.070> here

00:00:38.209 --> 00:00:38.219 
this has a little little tab right here

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:47.080 
this has a little little tab right here
just<00:00:38.969> push<00:00:39.180> that<00:00:39.329> screw<00:00:39.660> back<00:00:40.520> line<00:00:41.520> those<00:00:41.760> up

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:47.090 

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:49.729 

and<00:00:48.090> tighten<00:00:48.510> that<00:00:48.690> down<00:00:48.750> just<00:00:48.960> enough<00:00:49.530> that

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
and tighten that down just enough that

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:52.220 
and tighten that down just enough that
the<00:00:50.190> button<00:00:51.090> still<00:00:51.360> move<00:00:51.570> but<00:00:51.899> they<00:00:52.050> don't

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
the button still move but they don't

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:59.119 
the button still move but they don't
wiggle<00:00:52.440> back<00:00:52.680> and<00:00:52.949> forth<00:00:53.160> too<00:00:53.370> much<00:00:58.129> alright

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
wiggle back and forth too much alright

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:02.900 
wiggle back and forth too much alright
and<00:01:01.070> repeat<00:01:02.070> the<00:01:02.100> process<00:01:02.219> for<00:01:02.609> the<00:01:02.820> other

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
and repeat the process for the other

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:06.380 
and repeat the process for the other
side<00:01:04.309> might<00:01:05.309> be<00:01:05.489> easier<00:01:05.519> just<00:01:05.729> to<00:01:05.939> throw<00:01:06.180> this

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
side might be easier just to throw this

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:10.240 
side might be easier just to throw this
up

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:10.250 

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:13.300 

on<00:01:10.820> there<00:01:11.080> if<00:01:12.080> the<00:01:12.440> tabs<00:01:12.680> a<00:01:12.830> little<00:01:13.040> bit<00:01:13.160> you

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:13.310 
on there if the tabs a little bit you

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:14.470 
on there if the tabs a little bit you
might<00:01:13.400> have<00:01:13.520> to<00:01:13.610> shave<00:01:13.820> it<00:01:13.970> down<00:01:14.000> so<00:01:14.330> it<00:01:14.360> will

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:14.480 
might have to shave it down so it will

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:17.590 
might have to shave it down so it will
fit<00:01:14.510> in<00:01:14.780> that<00:01:16.120> that<00:01:17.120> just<00:01:17.300> gives<00:01:17.450> a<00:01:17.570> little

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:17.600 
fit in that that just gives a little

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:26.410 
fit in that that just gives a little
little<00:01:18.380> bit<00:01:18.530> more<00:01:18.710> support<00:01:24.729> so<00:01:25.729> trigger

00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:26.420 
little bit more support so trigger

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:51.810 
little bit more support so trigger
button<00:01:26.810> on<00:01:26.900> the<00:01:26.990> outside

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:51.820 

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:56.700 

ok<00:01:52.659> and<00:01:52.750> that's<00:01:52.930> basic<00:01:53.380> assembly<00:01:55.440> now<00:01:56.440> just

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:56.710 
ok and that's basic assembly now just

00:01:56.710 --> 00:01:59.160 
ok and that's basic assembly now just
bring<00:01:56.920> in<00:01:57.040> your<00:01:57.159> controller<00:01:57.900> slide<00:01:58.900> it<00:01:58.990> in<00:01:59.050> the
