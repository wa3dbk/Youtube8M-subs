end of the restore or an install and it
was<00:00:35.160> stuck<00:00:35.550> on<00:00:35.940> the<00:00:36.300> initial<00:00:36.809> Apple<00:00:37.559> screen

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:37.920 
was stuck on the initial Apple screen

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:39.799 
was stuck on the initial Apple screen
the<00:00:38.340> Apple<00:00:38.640> logo<00:00:38.760> that<00:00:39.030> appears<00:00:39.390> at<00:00:39.539> the<00:00:39.600> very

00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:39.809 
the Apple logo that appears at the very

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:42.650 
the Apple logo that appears at the very
beginning<00:00:39.989> when<00:00:40.649> you<00:00:40.859> power<00:00:41.730> up<00:00:42.030> your<00:00:42.059> device

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:42.660 
beginning when you power up your device

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:45.770 
beginning when you power up your device
to<00:00:43.410> stay<00:00:43.800> there<00:00:44.280> for<00:00:44.969> about<00:00:45.090> a<00:00:45.179> minute<00:00:45.480> or<00:00:45.539> so

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
to stay there for about a minute or so

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:47.450 
to stay there for about a minute or so
and<00:00:45.809> then<00:00:46.170> the<00:00:46.620> screen<00:00:46.829> would<00:00:46.949> just<00:00:47.100> go<00:00:47.190> black

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:47.460 
and then the screen would just go black

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:49.279 
and then the screen would just go black
and<00:00:47.789> essentially<00:00:48.539> the<00:00:48.690> device<00:00:48.929> have<00:00:49.109> turned

00:00:49.279 --> 00:00:49.289 
and essentially the device have turned

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:52.910 
and essentially the device have turned
off<00:00:49.440> I<00:00:49.710> tried<00:00:50.670> to<00:00:50.910> restart<00:00:51.600> several<00:00:51.870> times<00:00:52.289> and

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
off I tried to restart several times and

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:55.490 
off I tried to restart several times and
I<00:00:52.980> kept<00:00:53.190> having<00:00:53.339> an<00:00:53.550> exact<00:00:53.850> same<00:00:54.059> issue<00:00:54.359> and<00:00:54.750> I

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:56.750 
I kept having an exact same issue and I
couldn't<00:00:55.800> figure<00:00:55.920> out<00:00:56.039> a<00:00:56.129> way<00:00:56.190> to<00:00:56.219> resolve<00:00:56.550> it

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
couldn't figure out a way to resolve it

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:59.419 
couldn't figure out a way to resolve it
I<00:00:56.940> looked<00:00:57.629> online<00:00:57.780> people<00:00:58.769> suggested<00:00:59.280> things
