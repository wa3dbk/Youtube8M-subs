00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:06.019 

primarily<00:00:04.080> what<00:00:04.589> we'd<00:00:04.770> be<00:00:04.920> looking<00:00:05.100> for<00:00:05.580> would

00:00:06.019 --> 00:00:06.029 
primarily what we'd be looking for would

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:07.550 
primarily what we'd be looking for would
be<00:00:06.060> that<00:00:06.540> they<00:00:06.690> can<00:00:06.899> actually<00:00:07.290> work<00:00:07.529> with

00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:07.560 
be that they can actually work with

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:10.970 
be that they can actually work with
concepts<00:00:08.630> they<00:00:09.630> can<00:00:09.809> engage<00:00:09.960> with<00:00:10.139> concepts

00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:10.980 
concepts they can engage with concepts

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:12.890 
concepts they can engage with concepts
so<00:00:11.219> they're<00:00:11.460> not<00:00:11.550> just<00:00:11.610> working<00:00:12.030> from<00:00:12.480> things

00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:12.900 
so they're not just working from things

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:15.259 
so they're not just working from things
seen<00:00:13.290> they<00:00:14.250> are<00:00:14.280> working<00:00:14.639> from<00:00:14.940> things

00:00:15.259 --> 00:00:15.269 
seen they are working from things

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:17.359 
seen they are working from things
thought<00:00:15.630> about<00:00:15.990> can<00:00:16.650> you<00:00:16.710> tell<00:00:16.949> me<00:00:17.070> a<00:00:17.100> little

00:00:17.359 --> 00:00:17.369 
thought about can you tell me a little

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:19.730 
thought about can you tell me a little
bit<00:00:17.640> about<00:00:17.880> the<00:00:18.029> idea<00:00:18.359> how<00:00:18.660> did<00:00:18.900> how<00:00:19.380> did<00:00:19.410> the

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:19.740 
bit about the idea how did how did the

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:23.060 
bit about the idea how did how did the
idea<00:00:20.180> develop<00:00:21.180> the<00:00:21.750> first<00:00:22.020> thing<00:00:22.260> I<00:00:22.380> thought

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:23.070 
idea develop the first thing I thought

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:26.150 
idea develop the first thing I thought
about<00:00:23.130> was<00:00:23.820> the<00:00:24.570> year<00:00:24.600> of<00:00:24.869> rat<00:00:25.230> and<00:00:25.710> sort<00:00:25.920> of<00:00:25.949> a

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:26.160 
about was the year of rat and sort of a

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:28.550 
about was the year of rat and sort of a
Chinese<00:00:26.609> way<00:00:26.820> of<00:00:27.029> what<00:00:27.630> lucky<00:00:27.930> charm<00:00:28.170> would<00:00:28.410> be

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:28.560 
Chinese way of what lucky charm would be

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:31.189 
Chinese way of what lucky charm would be
but<00:00:29.550> then<00:00:29.699> I<00:00:29.820> thought<00:00:30.029> about<00:00:30.090> lucky<00:00:30.660> charm<00:00:30.929> as

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:31.199 
but then I thought about lucky charm as

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:35.240 
but then I thought about lucky charm as
in<00:00:31.439> a<00:00:31.679> an<00:00:32.669> object<00:00:33.420> that<00:00:34.050> protects<00:00:34.739> you

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:35.250 
in a an object that protects you

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:38.330 
in a an object that protects you
I<00:00:35.300> started<00:00:36.300> off<00:00:36.450> thinking<00:00:37.020> about<00:00:37.340> maybe

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:38.340 
I started off thinking about maybe

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:43.549 
I started off thinking about maybe
taking<00:00:38.579> a<00:00:38.850> be<00:00:39.030> a<00:00:39.140> jewelry<00:00:40.140> course<00:00:40.700> and<00:00:42.559> I

00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:43.559 
taking a be a jewelry course and I

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:46.880 
taking a be a jewelry course and I
really<00:00:43.950> got<00:00:44.100> into<00:00:44.160> it<00:00:44.550> like<00:00:45.329> using<00:00:45.539> metal<00:00:46.079> sort

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
really got into it like using metal sort

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:51.650 
really got into it like using metal sort
of<00:00:46.980> hands-on<00:00:47.969> work<00:00:50.090> how<00:00:51.090> did<00:00:51.239> you<00:00:51.300> get<00:00:51.449> from

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:51.660 
of hands-on work how did you get from

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:55.130 
of hands-on work how did you get from
this<00:00:52.140> to<00:00:53.070> this<00:00:53.960> fishbones

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
this to this fishbones

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:57.350 
this to this fishbones
I<00:00:55.230> always<00:00:55.530> get<00:00:55.710> choked<00:00:56.010> on<00:00:56.250> fish<00:00:56.460> bones<00:00:56.760> and

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360 
I always get choked on fish bones and

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:01.700 
I always get choked on fish bones and
the<00:00:57.780> way<00:00:58.730> that<00:00:59.730> this<00:00:59.910> would<00:01:00.090> rot<00:01:01.020> me<00:01:01.170> stop<00:01:01.559> you

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
the way that this would rot me stop you

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:03.889 
the way that this would rot me stop you
from<00:01:01.859> choking<00:01:02.129> I<00:01:02.579> wonder<00:01:03.329> what<00:01:03.449> would<00:01:03.600> happen

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:03.899 
from choking I wonder what would happen

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:05.600 
from choking I wonder what would happen
if<00:01:04.049> you<00:01:04.170> wore<00:01:04.350> that<00:01:04.500> in<00:01:04.650> a<00:01:04.739> fish<00:01:04.979> restaurant

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
if you wore that in a fish restaurant

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:09.399 
if you wore that in a fish restaurant
they<00:01:05.790> might<00:01:05.939> give<00:01:06.119> me<00:01:06.150> free<00:01:06.420> fish<00:01:06.659> they<00:01:07.020> might

00:01:09.399 --> 00:01:09.409 

00:01:09.409 --> 00:01:12.170 

very<00:01:10.409> often<00:01:10.920> you<00:01:11.100> do<00:01:11.310> have<00:01:11.549> to<00:01:11.760> redirect

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 
very often you do have to redirect

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:15.230 
very often you do have to redirect
students<00:01:12.960> and<00:01:13.260> you<00:01:13.979> have<00:01:14.010> to<00:01:14.580> look<00:01:15.000> at<00:01:15.150> the

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
students and you have to look at the

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:17.030 
students and you have to look at the
level<00:01:15.450> of<00:01:15.600> course<00:01:16.259> that<00:01:16.470> they've<00:01:16.619> applied<00:01:16.890> for

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
level of course that they've applied for

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:19.820 
level of course that they've applied for
and<00:01:17.700> maybe<00:01:18.240> initially<00:01:19.020> disappoint<00:01:19.619> them

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830 
and maybe initially disappoint them

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:22.100 
and maybe initially disappoint them
because<00:01:20.159> they<00:01:20.340> will<00:01:20.520> not<00:01:20.790> be<00:01:21.030> getting<00:01:21.240> the

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
because they will not be getting the

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:24.590 
because they will not be getting the
kind<00:01:22.470> of<00:01:22.619> offer<00:01:22.830> that<00:01:23.040> they<00:01:23.340> anticipate<00:01:24.119> well

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
kind of offer that they anticipate well

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:27.920 
kind of offer that they anticipate well
I<00:01:24.630> first<00:01:25.140> apply<00:01:25.890> and<00:01:26.479> direct<00:01:27.479> to<00:01:27.750> the

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
I first apply and direct to the

people he didn't have the same kind of

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:43.700 
people he didn't have the same kind of
work<00:01:40.049> that<00:01:40.259> I<00:01:40.320> had<00:01:41.450> so<00:01:42.450> at<00:01:42.630> that<00:01:42.810> stage<00:01:43.229> during

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:43.710 
work that I had so at that stage during

work that I had so at that stage during
the<00:01:44.009> interview<00:01:44.490> I<00:01:44.520> decided<00:01:44.939> to<00:01:45.180> go<00:01:45.750> back<00:01:45.990> step

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:46.799 
the interview I decided to go back step

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:48.770 
the interview I decided to go back step
back<00:01:47.070> and<00:01:47.369> do<00:01:47.520> a<00:01:47.549> foundation<00:01:47.820> course<00:01:48.540> to

tremendous responsibility to make sure
that<00:02:07.320> that<00:02:07.469> match

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:08.500 
that that match

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:12.510 
that that match
they<00:02:08.920> will<00:02:09.190> have<00:02:09.460> a<00:02:09.760> more<00:02:10.090> focused<00:02:10.800> view<00:02:11.800> of
