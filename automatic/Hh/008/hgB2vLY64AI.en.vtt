00:00:10.459 --> 00:00:10.469 
physiology training etc so there are two

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:11.900 
physiology training etc so there are two
books<00:00:10.679> in<00:00:10.769> particular<00:00:11.219> that<00:00:11.309> I<00:00:11.400> like<00:00:11.580> to<00:00:11.700> use

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 
this open now study a lot anatomy and a

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:00.410 
this open now study a lot anatomy and a
lot<00:00:58.079> of<00:00:58.109> cadavers<00:00:58.559> and<00:00:58.739> stuff<00:00:59.059> but<00:01:00.059> i'll<00:01:00.210> still

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
lot of cadavers and stuff but i'll still

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:01.880 
lot of cadavers and stuff but i'll still
bust<00:01:00.750> this<00:01:00.899> open<00:01:01.050> and<00:01:01.350> i'll<00:01:01.410> look<00:01:01.559> at<00:01:01.710> what's

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
bust this open and i'll look at what's

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:03.920 
bust this open and i'll look at what's
going<00:01:01.980> on<00:01:02.219> in<00:01:02.280> the<00:01:02.460> region<00:01:02.760> so<00:01:02.969> you<00:01:03.510> know<00:01:03.629> it

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
going on in the region so you know it

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:05.810 
going on in the region so you know it
gives<00:01:04.439> me<00:01:04.619> some<00:01:04.799> reminders<00:01:05.100> of<00:01:05.309> the<00:01:05.580> anatomy

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
gives me some reminders of the anatomy

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:07.160 
gives me some reminders of the anatomy
in<00:01:06.030> the<00:01:06.060> area<00:01:06.360> so<00:01:06.510> this<00:01:06.659> right<00:01:06.840> here<00:01:06.900> is<00:01:07.110> the

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
in the area so this right here is the

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:09.950 
in the area so this right here is the
thoracolumbar<00:01:07.650> upon<00:01:08.460> your<00:01:08.640> OSIS<00:01:08.970> you<00:01:09.720> can<00:01:09.840> see

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960 
thoracolumbar upon your OSIS you can see

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:11.330 
thoracolumbar upon your OSIS you can see
that<00:01:09.990> the<00:01:10.200> lat<00:01:10.380> comes<00:01:10.650> down<00:01:10.830> and<00:01:10.979> attaches

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
that the lat comes down and attaches

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:12.950 
that the lat comes down and attaches
it's<00:01:11.520> just<00:01:11.670> a<00:01:11.729> broad<00:01:11.970> tendon<00:01:12.479> sheath<00:01:12.720> then<00:01:12.869> it

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 
it's just a broad tendon sheath then it

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:14.600 
it's just a broad tendon sheath then it
attaches<00:01:13.229> down<00:01:13.500> here<00:01:13.710> on<00:01:13.830> this<00:01:13.950> iliac<00:01:14.280> crest

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
attaches down here on this iliac crest

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:17.480 
attaches down here on this iliac crest
so<00:01:15.180> for<00:01:15.390> example<00:01:15.420> if<00:01:15.990> I'm<00:01:16.830> tight<00:01:17.100> here<00:01:17.310> in<00:01:17.400> my

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
so for example if I'm tight here in my

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:18.890 
so for example if I'm tight here in my
lap<00:01:17.700> then<00:01:17.970> that<00:01:18.090> can<00:01:18.210> contribute<00:01:18.540> to<00:01:18.689> some

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900 
lap then that can contribute to some

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:20.300 
lap then that can contribute to some
tightness<00:01:19.200> here<00:01:19.439> so<00:01:19.590> it<00:01:19.680> gave<00:01:19.770> me<00:01:19.890> the<00:01:19.979> idea<00:01:20.070> to

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
tightness here so it gave me the idea to

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:22.609 
tightness here so it gave me the idea to
do<00:01:20.580> a<00:01:20.610> little<00:01:20.850> bit<00:01:21.000> of<00:01:21.030> shoulder<00:01:21.689> mobility<00:01:21.930> so

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:22.619 
do a little bit of shoulder mobility so

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:23.810 
do a little bit of shoulder mobility so
that's<00:01:22.799> kind<00:01:22.979> of<00:01:23.009> how<00:01:23.130> I'll<00:01:23.340> use<00:01:23.610> this

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820 
that's kind of how I'll use this

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:25.999 
that's kind of how I'll use this
particular<00:01:24.030> book<00:01:24.479> as<00:01:24.659> you<00:01:24.810> can<00:01:24.960> see<00:01:25.170> it's<00:01:25.890> very

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:26.009 
particular book as you can see it's very

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:29.960 
particular book as you can see it's very
detailed<00:01:26.580> very<00:01:26.640> well<00:01:27.000> drawn<00:01:27.770> this<00:01:28.770> this<00:01:29.729> is

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:29.970 
detailed very well drawn this this is

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:31.340 
detailed very well drawn this this is
more<00:01:30.240> of<00:01:30.270> a<00:01:30.390> deeper<00:01:30.689> layer<00:01:30.840> compared<00:01:31.229> to<00:01:31.290> the

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
more of a deeper layer compared to the

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:33.140 
more of a deeper layer compared to the
superficial<00:01:31.950> layers<00:01:32.159> a<00:01:32.250> second<00:01:32.579> ago<00:01:32.790> and<00:01:33.060> then

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:33.150 
superficial layers a second ago and then

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:35.450

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:18.430 
the area so let's just look at the glute

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:20.970 
the area so let's just look at the glute
medius<00:02:18.580> here<00:02:19.030> we'll<00:02:19.959> go<00:02:20.080> to<00:02:20.170> that<00:02:20.290> section<00:02:20.560> and

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:20.980 
medius here we'll go to that section and

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:24.960 
medius here we'll go to that section and
so<00:02:21.550> what<00:02:21.880> it<00:02:21.970> does<00:02:22.150> is<00:02:22.330> it'll<00:02:22.480> show<00:02:22.720> a<00:02:23.970> pain
