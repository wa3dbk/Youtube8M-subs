00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:17.320
 it is desirable that prior to implantation the 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:19.539
 cissa as streets or 

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:22.240
 whole neighborhoods are 

00:00:19.539 --> 00:00:23.890
 education in the community looking 

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:26.349
 involve the population 

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:28.630
 the depredation usually made by 

00:00:26.349 --> 00:00:31.289
 improvements is one of the major problems of 

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:31.289
 urban afforestation 

00:00:31.419 --> 00:00:35.920
 planting can also be done in 

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:37.420
 replacement of any dead tree or 

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:40.120
 needs to be cut 

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:42.699
 I see these pauinÃ­ on the electric grid 

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:45.370
 are being replaced by new 

00:00:42.699 --> 00:00:47.440
 trees of the same species planted in 

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:51.219
 neighboring area over which there is no 

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:53.960
 in two years the trees below the 

00:00:51.219 --> 00:00:56.660
 network may be cut off 

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:59.090
 the seedlings to be used should be 

00:00:56.660 --> 00:01:00.949
 least two meters tall and stem with 

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:02.629
 breast height diameter of at least 

00:01:00.949 --> 00:01:04.820
 three centimeters 

00:01:02.629 --> 00:01:07.250
 with these dimensions or from the 

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:09.799
 information ports have already been made 

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:11.300
 in the nursery decreasing costs and the fine 

00:01:09.799 --> 00:01:13.280
 have increased their chances of 

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:16.610
 establishment with reduced 

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:19.790
 depredation due to its size 

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:21.470
 the cup must have minimum dimensions of 50 

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:23.869
 inches wide and 

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:25.940
 the size you can reach 

00:01:23.869 --> 00:01:29.149
 up to one meter if the soil was very poor 

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:32.750
 or if the transplanted tree was large 

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:34.550
 coming from living in our 

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:37.100
 demonstration recorded on the campus of 

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:39.619
 Federal University of ViÃ§osa where good 

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:42.950
 part of the occupied areas are cuts and 

00:01:39.619 --> 00:01:46.880
 the chosen dimensions are 60 

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:49.100
 60% by 60% as substrate is used 

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:51.619
 two-thirds of the land withdrawn from the 

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:54.170
 above the pit to be separated 

00:01:51.619 --> 00:01:56.810
 previously one third of manure 

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:59.630
 organic as compound tanned manure 

00:01:56.810 --> 00:02:02.509
 or humus considering that the planting 

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:04.909
 straight through various soil is 

00:02:02.509 --> 00:02:07.280
 difficult to do soil analysis for 

00:02:04.909 --> 00:02:10.190
 determining the dosage of fertilizer is not 

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:13.970
 live where soils are well known 

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:15.920
 200 grams of formulation 6 is used. 

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:18.380
 from npk per hole 

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:21.620
 In general, however, it is advisable to 

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:24.769
 200 grams to the traditional formula 4 14 8 

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:28.040
 and if the soil is acid another 200 grams 

00:02:24.769 --> 00:02:30.860
 dolomitic limestone plus fertilizer 

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:33.019
 organic fertilizer and mineral fertilizer should be 

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:33.739
 well mixed and placed back in the 

00:02:33.019 --> 00:02:36.470
 pit 

00:02:33.739 --> 00:02:38.720
 the packaging surrounding the change should 

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:42.500
 be carefully removed so that the 

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:44.660
 do not disintegrate the 

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:46.730
 bottom of the clod along with the roots 

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:50.269
 that eventually become entangled should be 

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:52.459
 cut with a knife in the next step to 

00:02:50.269 --> 00:02:54.739
 mutation is put into the pit taking care 

00:02:52.459 --> 00:02:57.350
 that the collection that is the dividing region 

00:02:54.739 --> 00:02:59.570
 between the aerial part and the roots do not 

00:02:57.350 --> 00:03:01.310
 stay below ground level because 

00:02:59.570 --> 00:03:03.639
 many species do not withstand a 

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:07.140
 drowning collect 

00:03:03.639 --> 00:03:09.030
 Another important point the staking 

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:11.160
 is made to straighten the seedling and 

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:12.000
 also to support it protecting action 

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:14.490
 of the wind 

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:17.790
 the doctor should be held vertically 

00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:20.790
 below the bottom of the pit so that 

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:22.950
 stand firm then the stem of the seedling is 

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:25.590
 tied to tutor with cotton cord 

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:29.730
 or sisal at three different points for 

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:32.400
 ensure that the cord is 

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:34.830
 placed around the stem and the tutor in the 

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:38.640
 form of 8 or involving both 

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:40.350
 irrigation is also 

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:42.630
 important point at the time of planting 

00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:45.209
 being necessary to look at the substrate 

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:47.220
 abundant procedure that should be 

00:03:45.209 --> 00:03:48.150
 repeat daily for at least 15 

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:50.610
 days 

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:52.830
 unless it rains is recommended 

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:56.810
 also cover the substrate with dry grass 

00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:56.810
 to maintain moisture
