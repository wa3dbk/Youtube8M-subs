00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:35.290 
something like that and I put it in at

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:36.630 
something like that and I put it in at
home<00:02:35.530> because<00:02:35.980> I<00:02:36.070> thought<00:02:36.220> that<00:02:36.400> was<00:02:36.520> what

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:41.020 
in a holder Tom holder and it is just

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:43.140 
in a holder Tom holder and it is just
some<00:02:41.140> awful<00:02:41.500> standing<00:02:41.860> waves<00:02:42.010> of<00:02:42.310> it<00:02:42.490> so<00:02:43.000> then

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:43.150 
some awful standing waves of it so then

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:45.000 
some awful standing waves of it so then
I<00:02:43.480> took<00:02:43.600> it<00:02:44.080> took<00:02:44.200> it<00:02:44.320> out<00:02:44.410> of<00:02:44.500> the<00:02:44.560> Tom<00:02:44.740> case

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:45.010 
I took it took it out of the Tom case

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:46.980 
I took it took it out of the Tom case
there's<00:02:45.640> a<00:02:45.790> few<00:02:46.030> articles<00:02:46.330> saying<00:02:46.720> why<00:02:46.930> you

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:46.990 
there's a few articles saying why you

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:48.930 
there's a few articles saying why you
shouldn't<00:02:47.380> put<00:02:47.590> it<00:02:47.770> and<00:02:47.950> you're<00:02:48.430> so<00:02:48.610> kicking

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:48.940 
shouldn't put it and you're so kicking

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:52.500 
shouldn't put it and you're so kicking
so<00:02:49.060> I<00:02:49.090> the<00:02:49.180> Tom<00:02:49.770> holder<00:02:50.770> and<00:02:51.160> it's<00:02:52.120> just<00:02:52.330> to<00:02:52.390> do

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:52.510 
so I the Tom holder and it's just to do

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:53.850 
so I the Tom holder and it's just to do
with<00:02:52.660> the<00:02:52.780> standing<00:02:53.230> waves<00:02:53.410> and<00:02:53.650> stuff

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:53.860 
with the standing waves and stuff

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:55.830 
with the standing waves and stuff
getting<00:02:54.040> in<00:02:54.160> your<00:02:54.280> way

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:55.840 
getting in your way

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:59.130 
getting in your way
yeah<00:02:56.530> so<00:02:56.890> this<00:02:57.010> is<00:02:57.220> called<00:02:58.090> the<00:02:58.690> industry

00:02:59.130 --> 00:02:59.140 
yeah so this is called the industry

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:03.300 
yeah so this is called the industry

yet<00:03:09.730> so<00:03:10.270> one<00:03:11.020> of<00:03:11.050> the<00:03:11.140> reasons<00:03:11.260> why<00:03:11.530> this<00:03:11.590> is<00:03:12.040> so

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:12.670

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:33.030 
size of a 22 inch kick drum the other
reason<00:03:31.300> is<00:03:31.480> because<00:03:31.720> of<00:03:32.380> the<00:03:32.680> same<00:03:32.860> which<00:03:32.980> I

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:33.040 
reason is because of the same which I

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:38.150 
reason is because of the same which I
bet<00:03:33.190> showing<00:03:33.459> our<00:03:33.640> axis<00:03:34.540> rejection

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:38.160 

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:42.060 

so<00:03:39.160> what<00:03:39.459> off<00:03:39.640> access<00:03:40.180> rejection<00:03:40.720> is<00:03:40.930> is<00:03:41.230> the

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:42.070 
so what off access rejection is is the

00:03:42.070 --> 00:03:44.550 
so what off access rejection is is the
ability<00:03:42.280> to<00:03:42.540> pick<00:03:43.540> up<00:03:43.690> what's<00:03:43.959> point<00:03:44.350> to<00:03:44.440> that

00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:44.560 
ability to pick up what's point to that

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:47.400 
ability to pick up what's point to that
and<00:03:45.010> reject<00:03:45.610> sounds<00:03:46.120> that<00:03:46.420> it's<00:03:46.900> not<00:03:47.110> point<00:03:47.350> to

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:47.410 
and reject sounds that it's not point to

00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:49.170 
and reject sounds that it's not point to
that<00:03:47.530> so<00:03:48.190> it's<00:03:48.430> going<00:03:48.519> to<00:03:48.580> lick<00:03:48.730> my<00:03:48.820> fingers

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:49.180 
that so it's going to lick my fingers

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:50.340 
that so it's going to lick my fingers
here<00:03:49.300> if<00:03:49.420> you<00:03:49.510> just<00:03:49.600> keep<00:03:49.870> your<00:03:49.930> eyes<00:03:50.110> in<00:03:50.260> this

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:50.350 
here if you just keep your eyes in this

00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:54.540 
here if you just keep your eyes in this
dial<00:03:51.269> it's<00:03:52.269> it's<00:03:52.690> really<00:03:52.870> jumping<00:03:53.430> and<00:03:54.430> then

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:54.550 
dial it's it's really jumping and then

00:03:54.550 --> 00:03:57.600 
dial it's it's really jumping and then
if<00:03:54.670> you<00:03:54.760> move<00:03:54.910> it<00:03:55.060> away<00:03:55.150> from<00:03:55.239> it<00:03:56.459> it's<00:03:57.459> not

00:03:57.600 --> 00:03:57.610 
if you move it away from it it's not

00:03:57.610 --> 00:04:01.979 
if you move it away from it it's not
reading<00:03:57.910> them<00:03:58.090> so<00:03:58.120> much<00:03:58.390> so<00:03:59.550> that's<00:04:00.550> a<00:04:00.989> rough

00:04:01.979 --> 00:04:01.989 
reading them so much so that's a rough

00:04:01.989 --> 00:04:06.840 
reading them so much so that's a rough
example<00:04:02.110> of<00:04:02.530> off<00:04:02.739> axis<00:04:03.190> rejection<00:04:03.550> so<00:04:05.850> it's

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:06.850 
example of off axis rejection so it's

00:04:06.850 --> 00:04:08.100 
example of off axis rejection so it's
going<00:04:07.000> to<00:04:07.060> pick<00:04:07.180> up<00:04:07.300> words<00:04:07.480> point<00:04:07.750> that<00:04:07.870> it's

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:08.110 
going to pick up words point that it's

00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:11.190 
going to pick up words point that it's
going<00:04:08.230> to<00:04:08.320> point<00:04:08.470> at<00:04:08.590> the<00:04:08.650> bass<00:04:08.800> drum<00:04:09.040> I<00:04:10.049> get<00:04:11.049> so

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:11.200 
going to point at the bass drum I get so

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:15.539 
going to point at the bass drum I get so
much<00:04:11.410> of<00:04:12.570> freedom<00:04:13.570> noise<00:04:13.750> or<00:04:14.380> a<00:04:14.440> bass<00:04:15.190> guitar

00:04:15.539 --> 00:04:15.549 
much of freedom noise or a bass guitar

00:04:15.549 --> 00:04:18.180 
much of freedom noise or a bass guitar
that's<00:04:15.940> in<00:04:16.090> the<00:04:16.180> same<00:04:16.390> room<00:04:16.859> so<00:04:17.859> yeah<00:04:18.010> you

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:18.190 
that's in the same room so yeah you

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:19.500 
that's in the same room so yeah you
can't<00:04:18.400> make<00:04:18.549> these<00:04:18.700> advance<00:04:19.120> and<00:04:19.269> you<00:04:19.330> want

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:19.510 
can't make these advance and you want

00:04:19.510 --> 00:04:22.009 
can't make these advance and you want

so<00:05:06.090> people<00:05:06.389> often<00:05:06.630> incorporate<00:05:07.380> a<00:05:07.650> pad<00:05:08.280> say<00:05:08.669> 20

00:05:08.990 --> 00:05:09.000 
so people often incorporate a pad say 20

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:11.659 
so people often incorporate a pad say 20
DB<00:05:09.270> pad<00:05:09.509> to<00:05:09.990> avoid<00:05:10.590> the<00:05:10.740> risk<00:05:10.949> of<00:05:11.190> damaging

00:05:11.659 --> 00:05:11.669 
DB pad to avoid the risk of damaging

their<00:05:11.970> their<00:05:12.330> preamp<00:05:12.690> so<00:05:12.870> I<00:05:12.900> just<00:05:13.110> cut<00:05:13.319> my

00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:13.470 
their their preamp so I just cut my

00:05:13.470 --> 00:05:17.930 
their their preamp so I just cut my
preamp<00:05:13.830> pretty<00:05:14.460> much<00:05:14.610> not<00:05:15.419> on<00:05:15.659> at<00:05:15.870> all<00:05:16.610> no<00:05:17.610> gain

00:05:17.930 --> 00:05:17.940 
preamp pretty much not on at all no gain

00:05:17.940 --> 00:05:19.879 
preamp pretty much not on at all no gain
and<00:05:18.210> that<00:05:19.139> does<00:05:19.440> the<00:05:19.560> trick<00:05:19.590> for<00:05:19.830> me

00:05:19.879 --> 00:05:19.889 
and that does the trick for me

00:05:19.889 --> 00:05:21.860 
and that does the trick for me
personally<00:05:20.099> but<00:05:20.550> just<00:05:20.819> be<00:05:21.210> for<00:05:21.509> a<00:05:21.539> super

00:05:21.860 --> 00:05:21.870 
personally but just be for a super

00:05:21.870 --> 00:05:24.229
