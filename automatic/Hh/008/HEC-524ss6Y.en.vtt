00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:04.160 

today<00:00:03.300> we<00:00:03.389> are<00:00:03.449> going<00:00:03.570> to<00:00:03.629> be<00:00:03.689> talking<00:00:03.959> about

00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:04.170 
today we are going to be talking about

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:06.590 
today we are going to be talking about
the<00:00:04.470> rainshadow<00:00:05.040> effect<00:00:05.069> and<00:00:05.910> in<00:00:06.150> order<00:00:06.359> to<00:00:06.420> do

00:00:06.590 --> 00:00:06.600 
the rainshadow effect and in order to do

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:08.690 
the rainshadow effect and in order to do
that<00:00:06.750> we<00:00:06.990> need<00:00:07.170> to<00:00:07.200> draw<00:00:07.500> a<00:00:07.529> diagram<00:00:07.950> of<00:00:08.490> a

00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:08.700 
that we need to draw a diagram of a

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:11.839 
that we need to draw a diagram of a
mountain<00:00:09.150> so<00:00:09.420> let's<00:00:09.570> get<00:00:09.719> started<00:00:10.139> there<00:00:10.849> so

00:00:11.839 --> 00:00:11.849 
mountain so let's get started there so

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:17.210 
mountain so let's get started there so
here's<00:00:12.150> the<00:00:12.330> mountain<00:00:15.289> and<00:00:16.289> let's<00:00:16.529> assume<00:00:16.650> air

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:17.220 
here's the mountain and let's assume air

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:20.120 
here's the mountain and let's assume air
is<00:00:17.430> coming<00:00:17.670> in<00:00:17.970> from<00:00:18.240> this<00:00:18.390> direction<00:00:19.039> so<00:00:20.039> the

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:20.130 
is coming in from this direction so the

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:23.779 
is coming in from this direction so the
wind<00:00:20.340> is<00:00:20.490> blowing<00:00:21.000> and<00:00:21.500> as<00:00:22.500> the<00:00:22.650> wind<00:00:22.859> blows<00:00:23.250> it

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:23.789 
wind is blowing and as the wind blows it

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:27.560 
wind is blowing and as the wind blows it
forces<00:00:24.600> that<00:00:24.810> air<00:00:25.199> up<00:00:25.490> the<00:00:26.490> mountainside<00:00:26.910> and

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:27.570 
forces that air up the mountainside and

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:29.870 
forces that air up the mountainside and
because<00:00:28.320> air<00:00:28.560> is<00:00:28.710> blowing<00:00:28.980> into<00:00:29.460> the<00:00:29.490> mountain

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:29.880 
because air is blowing into the mountain

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:31.370 
because air is blowing into the mountain
on<00:00:30.000> this<00:00:30.179> side<00:00:30.449> we're<00:00:30.750> going<00:00:30.840> to<00:00:30.929> call<00:00:31.170> this

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:31.380 
on this side we're going to call this

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:41.110 
on this side we're going to call this
the<00:00:31.619> windward<00:00:32.189> side<00:00:35.600> or<00:00:36.600> wind<00:00:36.989> facing<00:00:37.800> side

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:41.120 

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:44.959 

and<00:00:42.500> the<00:00:43.500> other<00:00:43.649> side<00:00:44.040> is<00:00:44.370> going<00:00:44.579> to<00:00:44.640> be<00:00:44.730> called

00:00:44.959 --> 00:00:44.969 
and the other side is going to be called

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:54.410 
and the other side is going to be called
the<00:00:45.090> leeward<00:00:45.690> side<00:00:51.170> now<00:00:52.170> as<00:00:52.559> this<00:00:53.550> wind<00:00:54.149> is

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
the leeward side now as this wind is

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:57.319 
the leeward side now as this wind is
blowing<00:00:54.930> up<00:00:55.140> the<00:00:55.590> mountain<00:00:55.980> this<00:00:56.550> air<00:00:56.879> mass

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
blowing up the mountain this air mass

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:00.290 
blowing up the mountain this air mass
encounters<00:00:58.289> less<00:00:58.649> pressure<00:00:59.100> it<00:00:59.699> turns<00:01:00.000> out

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
encounters less pressure it turns out

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:02.959 
encounters less pressure it turns out
that<00:01:00.480> as<00:01:00.629> you<00:01:00.660> move<00:01:00.930> up<00:01:01.230> in<00:01:01.440> altitude<00:01:02.280> there's

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:02.969 
that as you move up in altitude there's

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:05.600 
that as you move up in altitude there's
less<00:01:03.300> air<00:01:03.629> pressure<00:01:04.019> so<00:01:04.379> as<00:01:04.949> this<00:01:05.070> air<00:01:05.339> mass

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
less air pressure so as this air mass

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:09.200 
less air pressure so as this air mass
moves<00:01:06.000> up<00:01:06.299> it<00:01:06.510> begins<00:01:06.960> to<00:01:07.290> expand<00:01:08.250> and<00:01:08.610> is<00:01:09.000> that

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
moves up it begins to expand and is that

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:12.350 
moves up it begins to expand and is that
air<00:01:09.420> mass<00:01:09.799> expands<00:01:10.799> the<00:01:11.189> temperature<00:01:12.030> of<00:01:12.210> that

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 
air mass expands the temperature of that

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:15.410 
air mass expands the temperature of that
air<00:01:12.600> mass<00:01:12.869> begins<00:01:13.770> to<00:01:13.979> drop<00:01:14.360> now<00:01:15.360> the

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
air mass begins to drop now the

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:18.170 
air mass begins to drop now the
temperature<00:01:16.200> doesn't<00:01:16.500> drop<00:01:16.710> because<00:01:17.460> heat<00:01:17.939> is

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
temperature doesn't drop because heat is

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:21.950 
temperature doesn't drop because heat is
lost<00:01:18.570> to<00:01:18.930> the<00:01:19.020> surrounding<00:01:19.850> air<00:01:20.960> the

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960 
lost to the surrounding air the

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:24.560 
lost to the surrounding air the
temperature<00:01:22.470> drops<00:01:22.950> because<00:01:23.880> the<00:01:24.090> pressure

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 
temperature drops because the pressure

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:27.020 
temperature drops because the pressure
because<00:01:25.409> those<00:01:25.560> air<00:01:25.799> molecules<00:01:25.850> aren't<00:01:26.850> as

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
because those air molecules aren't as

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:28.940 
because those air molecules aren't as
close<00:01:27.390> to<00:01:27.570> each<00:01:27.720> other<00:01:27.930> as<00:01:28.200> they<00:01:28.350> used<00:01:28.590> to<00:01:28.770> be

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950 
close to each other as they used to be

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:30.980 
close to each other as they used to be
and<00:01:29.220> that's<00:01:29.759> important<00:01:30.420> there's<00:01:30.600> actually<00:01:30.960> a

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
and that's important there's actually a

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:33.440 
and that's important there's actually a
term<00:01:31.380> that<00:01:31.409> means<00:01:32.009> that<00:01:32.400> this<00:01:32.820> is<00:01:33.000> referred<00:01:33.420> to

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 
term that means that this is referred to

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:41.149 
term that means that this is referred to
as<00:01:33.750> adiabatic<00:01:34.500> cooling

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:44.999 

and<00:01:42.329> adiabatic<00:01:43.329> means<00:01:43.990> that<00:01:44.409> there's<00:01:44.859> no

00:01:44.999 --> 00:01:45.009 
and adiabatic means that there's no

00:01:45.009 --> 00:01:47.940 
and adiabatic means that there's no
addition<00:01:45.729> or<00:01:45.939> loss<00:01:46.329> of<00:01:46.689> heat<00:01:47.079> going<00:01:47.320> out<00:01:47.679> here

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:47.950 
addition or loss of heat going out here

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:51.080 
addition or loss of heat going out here
so<00:01:48.490> the<00:01:48.759> temperature<00:01:49.420> of<00:01:49.569> this<00:01:49.689> air<00:01:49.990> mass

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090 
so the temperature of this air mass

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:54.660 
so the temperature of this air mass
decreases<00:01:52.090> because<00:01:52.479> the<00:01:52.750> air<00:01:53.250> expands<00:01:54.250> not

00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:54.670 
decreases because the air expands not

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:56.730 
decreases because the air expands not
because<00:01:55.060> it<00:01:55.179> loses<00:01:55.329> heat<00:01:55.840> to<00:01:56.020> the<00:01:56.140> surrounding

00:01:56.730 --> 00:01:56.740 
because it loses heat to the surrounding

00:01:56.740 --> 00:01:59.069 
because it loses heat to the surrounding
air<00:01:56.920> and<00:01:57.610> that's<00:01:57.700> important<00:01:58.270> to<00:01:58.299> understand

00:01:59.069 --> 00:01:59.079 
air and that's important to understand

00:01:59.079 --> 00:02:02.130 
air and that's important to understand
now<00:01:59.679> as<00:01:59.860> the<00:01:59.979> air<00:02:00.130> mass<00:02:00.369> moves<00:02:00.789> up<00:02:01.090> here<00:02:01.450> the

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:02.140 
now as the air mass moves up here the

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:05.160 
now as the air mass moves up here the
air<00:02:02.319> is<00:02:02.350> cooled<00:02:02.920> and<00:02:03.280> as<00:02:03.759> the<00:02:03.880> air<00:02:04.119> gets<00:02:04.479> cooler

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:05.170 
air is cooled and as the air gets cooler

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:08.160 
air is cooled and as the air gets cooler
we<00:02:05.649> know<00:02:05.829> that<00:02:06.009> cool<00:02:06.310> air<00:02:06.609> can't<00:02:07.060> hold<00:02:07.509> as<00:02:07.840> much

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:08.170 
we know that cool air can't hold as much

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:10.859 
we know that cool air can't hold as much
moisture<00:02:08.610> so<00:02:09.610> what<00:02:09.759> begins<00:02:10.090> to<00:02:10.179> happen<00:02:10.299> is

00:02:10.859 --> 00:02:10.869 
moisture so what begins to happen is

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:15.780 
moisture so what begins to happen is
cloud<00:02:11.799> would<00:02:12.040> start<00:02:12.400> to<00:02:12.580> form<00:02:13.709> and<00:02:14.709> it<00:02:15.519> begins

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:15.790 
cloud would start to form and it begins

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:18.750 
cloud would start to form and it begins
to<00:02:16.120> rain<00:02:16.390> and<00:02:16.780> this<00:02:17.380> side<00:02:17.680> of<00:02:17.950> the<00:02:18.069> mountain<00:02:18.579> is

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:18.760 
to rain and this side of the mountain is

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:21.420 
to rain and this side of the mountain is
going<00:02:19.269> to<00:02:19.390> be<00:02:19.510> very<00:02:19.810> wet<00:02:20.260> in<00:02:20.470> fact<00:02:20.709> it's<00:02:20.950> so<00:02:21.160> wet

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:21.430 
going to be very wet in fact it's so wet

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:24.210 
going to be very wet in fact it's so wet
sometimes<00:02:22.030> it<00:02:22.720> actually<00:02:22.959> forms<00:02:23.590> a<00:02:23.799> cloud

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:24.220 
sometimes it actually forms a cloud

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:26.729 
sometimes it actually forms a cloud
forest<00:02:24.819> so<00:02:25.810> let's<00:02:25.989> write<00:02:26.200> that<00:02:26.260> down

00:02:26.729 --> 00:02:26.739 
forest so let's write that down

00:02:26.739 --> 00:02:32.640 
forest so let's write that down
cloud<00:02:27.250> forest<00:02:29.760> so<00:02:30.760> the<00:02:30.940> side<00:02:31.209> of<00:02:31.450> the<00:02:31.650> mountain

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:32.650 
cloud forest so the side of the mountain

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:35.400 
cloud forest so the side of the mountain
is<00:02:32.860> often<00:02:33.400> very<00:02:33.579> lush<00:02:34.030> and<00:02:34.269> vegetation<00:02:34.870> and

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:35.410 
is often very lush and vegetation and

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:39.300

the other side that air is going to

00:02:58.359 --> 00:03:02.670 
the other side that air is going to
begin<00:02:58.690> to<00:02:59.019> sink<00:03:00.810> so<00:03:01.810> let's<00:03:01.989> go<00:03:02.139> ahead<00:03:02.290> and<00:03:02.440> draw

00:03:05.819 --> 00:03:05.829 
so our air is beginning to sink now and

00:03:05.829 --> 00:03:09.240 
so our air is beginning to sink now and

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:09.250 
as that air sinks that air mass

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:11.819 
as that air sinks that air mass
encounters<00:03:09.940> greater<00:03:10.359> pressure<00:03:10.870> the<00:03:11.169> air<00:03:11.200> the
