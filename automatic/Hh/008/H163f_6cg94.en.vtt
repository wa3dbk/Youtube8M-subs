00:00:37.099 --> 00:00:37.109 
anything bad about this game I honestly

00:00:37.109 --> 00:00:38.869 
anything bad about this game I honestly
overhyped<00:00:37.590> myself<00:00:38.039> for<00:00:38.160> the<00:00:38.250> graphics<00:00:38.730> but

00:00:38.869 --> 00:00:38.879 
overhyped myself for the graphics but

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:40.369 
overhyped myself for the graphics but
then<00:00:39.149> again<00:00:39.329> I<00:00:39.359> had<00:00:39.570> to<00:00:39.600> remember<00:00:39.930> this<00:00:40.170> is<00:00:40.350> the

00:00:40.369 --> 00:00:40.379 
then again I had to remember this is the

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:43.099 
then again I had to remember this is the
360<00:00:41.129> so<00:00:41.579> maybe<00:00:41.760> we'll<00:00:42.000> get<00:00:42.120> lucky<00:00:42.180> and<00:00:42.750> see<00:00:43.079> a

00:00:43.099 --> 00:00:43.109 
360 so maybe we'll get lucky and see a

00:00:43.109 --> 00:00:45.619 
360 so maybe we'll get lucky and see a
next-gen<00:00:43.590> version<00:00:44.070> who<00:00:44.730> knows<00:00:44.969> that's<00:00:45.390> kind

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:45.629 
next-gen version who knows that's kind

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:47.209 
next-gen version who knows that's kind
of<00:00:45.750> stretching<00:00:46.289> because<00:00:46.679> they<00:00:46.980> never

00:00:47.209 --> 00:00:47.219 
of stretching because they never

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:49.340 
of stretching because they never
announced<00:00:47.730> it<00:00:47.879> but<00:00:48.420> why<00:00:48.809> have<00:00:48.960> to<00:00:49.050> see<00:00:49.199> when

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350
