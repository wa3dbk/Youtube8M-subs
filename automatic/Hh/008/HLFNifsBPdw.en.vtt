00:00:03.930 --> 00:00:08.400
 Hi, what about, first of all, I'd like 

00:00:06.090 --> 00:00:11.070
 thank again behringer peru 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:13.230
 for giving me the opportunity to be able to do 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:16.650
 a brief small video tutorial 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:17.760
 explaining the functions of that pedal the 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:21.480
 super senior 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:25.440
 sf 400 I hope you like it in second 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:27.180
 video tutorial and thanks see you soon 

00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:30.600
 We begin with the first knob 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:32.430
 which is what allows this to be done 

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:35.430
 knob what allows to do this 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:37.140
 knob is to select the types of 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:39.930
 effects that have predetermined this 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:42.120
 pedal for example has momentari which is 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:44.870
 an effect that allows you to use it as 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:49.320
 stop the expression 

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:51.810
 you have the gates the paner do you have him 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:54.420
 standard mode which is a mode of figer 

00:00:51.810 --> 00:00:57.210
 standard that is a classic flyer and 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:01:01.050
 you have the ultra that is a modern flyer 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:02.300
 with much more definition and much more 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:04.640
 deep 

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:06.500
 you have the following the next knob 

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:10.650
 which is the rate loss that determines 

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:12.480
 the speed of the effect you do not have the dip 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:14.520
 the apartment allows to create a Serbian 

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:16.980
 full deeper 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:19.040
 you have the loss of manual of manual 

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:21.650
 It serves for 

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:24.390
 to adjust the center frequencies in 

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:28.380
 which the effect is applied 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:31.300
 and you have the rest determine the amount 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:33.370
 of output signal 

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:35.050
 it is very important they are with how much 

00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:37.980
 intensity more you want it to be inside 

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:41.280
 of your sound the effect is not 

00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:43.860
 what rsm rsm means is a component 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:47.850
 that takes the pedal that its initials say 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:50.070
 real sound mods link as I said is a 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:52.170
 component that carries the pedal that makes 

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:55.260
 that the sound is more acoustic or more 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:57.390
 no longer go digital and be more 

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:58.920
 digestible for our ears this pedal 

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:02.070
 it also carries with it another kind of 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:04.650
 configuration that is squeezing two 

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:06.450
 seconds the pedal and then release it for 

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:09.920
 what does this configuration do for you? 

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:09.920
 play with the framework tempo 

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:44.910
 then we will prove this effect 

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:44.910
 with a super extra guitar 

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:54.769
 ah 

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:02.760
 all right 

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:07.580
 Y 

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:44.260
 to 

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:52.290
 and 

00:03:53.069 --> 00:03:55.549
 and 

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:19.290
 the 

00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:25.080
 Y 

00:04:34.539 --> 00:04:40.480
 i 

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:43.160
 or not 

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:45.700
 Y 

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:45.700
 to me 

00:04:52.030 --> 00:04:54.570
 t 

00:04:54.830 --> 00:04:57.250
 a 

00:05:00.729 --> 00:05:03.479
 m 

00:05:13.110 --> 00:05:16.110
 good 

00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:25.670
 Y 

00:05:32.790 --> 00:05:35.510
 all right 

00:05:43.870 --> 00:05:46.530
