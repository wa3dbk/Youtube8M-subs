00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:19.140
 I'm Eduardo and I'll show you 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:24.689
 how to make a safe or grohl bird 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:27.689
 prosperity of fortune which is 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:31.710
 tradition in Japan plays a role 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:33.290
 square 15 by 15 colored on one side and 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:38.730
 white on the other 

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:43.470
 in the middle did not 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:50.700
 company had well marked 

00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:56.340
 so now you fold everything 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:01:00.510
 again in the middle this way and now you 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:05.250
 will create a triangle 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:10.110
 so that the middle edge of the kakÃ¡ 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:20.490
 the other side to the middle as well. 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:26.759
 that way, yes, it's a 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:30.710
 triangle and you will open in the 

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:33.389
 way is ready 

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:36.469
 leaving the paper open part of the paper 

00:01:33.389 --> 00:01:41.249
 open down so 

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:44.189
 Now we're going to make a way to 

00:01:41.249 --> 00:01:47.459
 call the ice cream cone you fold 

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:49.229
 one side of the paper to the middle where 

00:01:47.459 --> 00:01:51.670
 was marked 

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:58.030
 thus 

00:01:51.670 --> 00:02:00.040
 on the other side the same thing but also 

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:02.619
 like this 

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:06.340
 see how it stayed 

00:02:02.619 --> 00:02:09.550
 Look at the two years turns the paper and makes the 

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:10.630
 same thing on the other side the 

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:18.310
 ice cream 

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:26.800
 so against the environment the other is also a 

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:29.230
 very well and now we are well on the 

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:30.700
 tip turned an ice cream cone 

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:33.519
 on both sides 

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:37.900
 here is a triangle we go 

00:02:33.519 --> 00:02:41.470
 mark to bend forward to back where 

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:44.650
 will be marked to facilitate the 

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:46.989
 next step also holding in the base 

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:53.140
 of triangle people will open both 

00:02:46.989 --> 00:02:59.709
 sides opening opening opening holding 

00:02:53.140 --> 00:03:04.150
 At the base of the triangle ready a 

00:02:59.709 --> 00:03:06.910
 geometric shape called the zango mark 

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:12.850
 well, that's all right 

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:14.680
 that way you do not need to 

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:17.769
 run a diamond 

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:19.000
 on the other side we'll do the same 

00:03:17.769 --> 00:03:22.180
 thing 

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:25.819
 let's hold the base in the open triangle 

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:30.230
 the other side is opening by opening 

00:03:25.819 --> 00:03:37.280
 going until it turns into another fight 

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:39.519
 diamond shape on the cameia tip you 

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:39.519
 go 

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:47.500
 to see that everything is already marked very well 

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:50.700
 yes a rhombus on one side and a rhombus 

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:50.700
 from the other 

00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:59.050
 Let's open the sides now. 

00:03:55.390 --> 00:04:03.760
 way here and here you will see here you 

00:03:59.050 --> 00:04:06.970
 open opening ready turned another 

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:10.540
 losangulo another using you will see that 

00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:14.320
 two tips were formed 

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:15.820
 these will be our ends that remain 

00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:19.450
 face up 

00:04:15.820 --> 00:04:21.970
 we'll do the same now 

00:04:19.450 --> 00:04:25.810
 we made with the ice cream cone 

00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:29.140
 let's double the mark in half 

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:38.470
 let's bend the edges 

00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:43.170
 up to the middle this way very well 

00:04:38.470 --> 00:04:47.250
 on the other side we will do the same thing 

00:04:43.170 --> 00:04:47.250
 mark the tips well 

00:04:49.699 --> 00:05:02.360
 very well this way 

00:04:54.360 --> 00:05:02.360
 so go and do the other side too 

00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:14.830
 origami is an art that requires 

00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:14.830
 concentration patience dedication 

00:05:15.620 --> 00:05:26.000
 done this you will have several figures 

00:05:21.550 --> 00:05:30.289
 origami very interesting good let's 

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:32.509
 score well here improve our 

00:05:30.289 --> 00:05:37.039
 dots not to get anything folded 

00:05:32.509 --> 00:05:40.039
 Wrong very well stays that way now 

00:05:37.039 --> 00:05:42.919
 we're going to turn that way and open the 

00:05:40.039 --> 00:05:45.710
 two tips on the board in another speech 

00:05:42.919 --> 00:05:49.699
 We're going to lift these ends until 

00:05:45.710 --> 00:05:53.990
 two on top and one on the same 

00:05:49.699 --> 00:05:58.669
 Half fold thing will get marked 

00:05:53.990 --> 00:06:01.370
 Look, it's all the same, all the tips 

00:05:58.669 --> 00:06:05.979
 same size same 

00:06:01.370 --> 00:06:05.979
 Let's open the sides again. 

00:06:06.139 --> 00:06:16.219
 so on the other side the same thing 

00:06:13.419 --> 00:06:21.590
 always hitting the tips to stay 

00:06:16.219 --> 00:06:24.830
 well finished so we'll choose one 

00:06:21.590 --> 00:06:28.909
 of the middle points and we will make a 

00:06:24.830 --> 00:06:29.949
 to be the beak of the 

00:06:28.909 --> 00:06:32.690
 place 

00:06:29.949 --> 00:06:41.539
 Let's hold the wings and let's pull 

00:06:32.690 --> 00:06:46.580
 slowly until the beak is formed that the tail 

00:06:41.539 --> 00:06:49.159
 of the palace is ready and if the tsuru that is 

00:06:46.580 --> 00:06:53.389
 a Japanese origami that is invented by 

00:06:49.159 --> 00:06:56.240
 Japanese and if you do a thousand 

00:06:53.389 --> 00:06:58.159
 You will fulfill your good luck wish. 

00:06:56.240 --> 00:07:00.759
 have a good job 

00:06:58.159 --> 00:07:00.759
 to the next
