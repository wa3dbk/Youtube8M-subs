00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210 
rap I'm really pinching here with thumb

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:32.210 
rap I'm really pinching here with thumb
and<00:01:30.360> forefinger<00:01:30.810> come<00:01:31.350> all<00:01:31.530> the<00:01:31.619> way<00:01:31.650> up<00:01:31.799> cop

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220 
and forefinger come all the way up cop

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:34.580 
and forefinger come all the way up cop
would<00:01:32.430> pull<00:01:32.880> straight<00:01:33.600> down<00:01:33.630> direct<00:01:34.350> pressure

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
would pull straight down direct pressure

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:36.980 
would pull straight down direct pressure
so<00:01:34.950> that<00:01:34.979> doesn't<00:01:35.579> spin<00:01:35.880> on<00:01:36.030> me<00:01:36.180> and<00:01:36.390> it<00:01:36.930> really

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
so that doesn't spin on me and it really

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:38.780 
so that doesn't spin on me and it really
wants<00:01:37.650> to<00:01:37.770> spin<00:01:38.100> so<00:01:38.369> you've<00:01:38.490> almost<00:01:38.610> got

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:38.790 
wants to spin so you've almost got

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:41.210 
wants to spin so you've almost got
really<00:01:39.030> overcompensate<00:01:39.840> that<00:01:40.130> keeping<00:01:41.130> that

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:41.220 
really overcompensate that keeping that

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:43.340 
really overcompensate that keeping that
on<00:01:41.369> top<00:01:41.640> of<00:01:41.700> the<00:01:41.880> hook<00:01:42.030> shank<00:01:42.060> really<00:01:43.049> pulling

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:43.350 
on top of the hook shank really pulling

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:47.149 
on top of the hook shank really pulling
down<00:01:43.680> and<00:01:44.250> now<00:01:44.970> I<00:01:45.000> can<00:01:45.299> move<00:01:45.329> up<00:01:45.840> front<00:01:46.380> of<00:01:46.680> this

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 
down and now I can move up front of this

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:50.120 
down and now I can move up front of this
wing<00:01:47.630> and<00:01:48.630> start<00:01:49.170> burying<00:01:49.649> some<00:01:49.860> thread

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
wing and start burying some thread

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:52.940 
wing and start burying some thread
underneath<00:01:50.399> there<00:01:51.140> to<00:01:52.140> really<00:01:52.350> get<00:01:52.590> that<00:01:52.799> to

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950 
underneath there to really get that to

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:55.760 
underneath there to really get that to
post<00:01:53.220> up<00:01:53.460> as<00:01:54.329> long<00:01:54.570> as<00:01:54.600> I<00:01:54.840> have<00:01:54.930> left<00:01:55.259> enough

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:55.770 
post up as long as I have left enough

00:01:55.770 --> 00:02:01.399 
post up as long as I have left enough
room<00:01:55.890> to<00:01:56.189> decipher<00:01:56.700> tips<00:01:57.000> from<00:01:57.540> butts<00:01:58.460> I<00:02:00.409> can

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:01.409 
room to decipher tips from butts I can

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:03.050 
room to decipher tips from butts I can
get<00:02:01.590> back<00:02:01.829> in<00:02:02.130> there<00:02:02.369> that<00:02:02.640> know<00:02:02.759> what<00:02:02.880> I<00:02:02.939> mean

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:03.060 
get back in there that know what I mean

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:04.670 
get back in there that know what I mean
by<00:02:03.210> that<00:02:03.240> is<00:02:03.420> the<00:02:03.659> length<00:02:03.869> of<00:02:04.049> the<00:02:04.170> buttons<00:02:04.530> is

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:04.680 
by that is the length of the buttons is

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:07.520 
by that is the length of the buttons is
much<00:02:04.890> more<00:02:05.310> so<00:02:05.610> than<00:02:05.850> the<00:02:05.909> tip<00:02:06.210> when<00:02:07.020> this<00:02:07.170> gets

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:07.530 
much more so than the tip when this gets

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:09.889 
much more so than the tip when this gets
really<00:02:07.879> very<00:02:08.879> similarly<00:02:09.390> it's<00:02:09.569> harder<00:02:09.869> to

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:09.899 
really very similarly it's harder to

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:10.410 
really very similarly it's harder to
define

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:10.420

dubbed body taper up go to the wing and

00:04:57.140 --> 00:05:01.240 
dubbed body taper up go to the wing and
then<00:04:57.830> forward<00:04:58.190> the<00:04:58.340> wing<00:04:58.610> even<00:05:00.130> key<00:05:01.130> to

dubbing<00:05:01.580> of<00:05:01.640> course<00:05:01.880> is<00:05:02.030> just<00:05:02.240> a<00:05:02.390> tiny<00:05:02.720> bit<00:05:02.840> at

00:05:02.980 --> 00:05:02.990 
dubbing of course is just a tiny bit at

00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:09.110 
common mistake is to use way too much

00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:15.340 
common mistake is to use way too much
dubbing<00:05:13.420> so<00:05:14.420> I'm<00:05:14.510> going<00:05:14.660> to<00:05:14.690> work<00:05:14.870> that<00:05:14.900> up

00:05:15.340 --> 00:05:15.350 
dubbing so I'm going to work that up

00:05:15.350 --> 00:05:19.420 
dubbing so I'm going to work that up
forward<00:05:17.500> the<00:05:18.500> orange<00:05:18.770> thread<00:05:18.980> is<00:05:19.280> not

00:05:21.100 --> 00:05:21.110 
certainly not a requirement you could

00:05:21.110 --> 00:05:22.690 
certainly not a requirement you could
use<00:05:21.200> a<00:05:21.260> brown<00:05:21.560> it<00:05:21.830> makes<00:05:21.980> it<00:05:22.130> easier<00:05:22.400> it's<00:05:22.580> not

00:05:22.690 --> 00:05:22.700 
use a brown it makes it easier it's not

00:05:22.700 --> 00:05:25.180 
use a brown it makes it easier it's not
going<00:05:22.790> to<00:05:22.880> shine<00:05:23.090> through<00:05:23.740> the<00:05:24.740> threads<00:05:25.040> not

either

00:05:34.310 --> 00:05:34.320 

00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:40.210 

so<00:05:35.320> we<00:05:35.530> need<00:05:35.710> a<00:05:35.740> little<00:05:35.920> more

00:05:40.210 --> 00:05:40.220 

00:05:40.220 --> 00:05:49.970 

much

00:05:49.970 --> 00:05:49.980 

00:05:49.980 --> 00:05:52.340 

one<00:05:50.820> more<00:05:51.030> wrap<00:05:51.270> here<00:05:51.510> and<00:05:51.660> again<00:05:52.140> another

00:05:52.340 --> 00:05:52.350 
one more wrap here and again another

00:05:52.350 --> 00:05:55.250 
one more wrap here and again another
opportunity<00:05:52.710> to<00:05:53.010> really<00:05:53.490> pin<00:05:53.820> that<00:05:54.060> back<00:05:54.330> get

00:05:55.250 --> 00:05:55.260 
opportunity to really pin that back get

00:05:55.260 --> 00:05:59.320 
opportunity to really pin that back get
some<00:05:55.290> dubbing<00:05:55.980> up<00:05:56.130> underneath<00:05:56.460> there

00:05:59.320 --> 00:05:59.330 

00:05:59.330 --> 00:06:01.820 

continue<00:06:00.330> that<00:06:00.510> dub<00:06:00.750> body<00:06:01.050> forward<00:06:01.590> to<00:06:01.710> the

00:06:01.820 --> 00:06:01.830 
continue that dub body forward to the
