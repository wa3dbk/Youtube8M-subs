prejudice<00:04:02.760> against<00:04:03.299> the<00:04:03.450> brand<00:04:03.720> some<00:04:04.379> people

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:04.650 
prejudice against the brand some people

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:07.190 
prejudice against the brand some people
would<00:04:04.739> associate<00:04:05.250> Jaguar<00:04:05.940> with<00:04:06.120> slippers<00:04:07.019> and

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:07.200 
would associate Jaguar with slippers and

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:11.420 
cigars but now the making products like
this<00:04:09.329> I<00:04:10.049> think<00:04:10.470> he's<00:04:10.620> difficult<00:04:10.829> for<00:04:11.250> them<00:04:11.340> to

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:11.430 
this I think he's difficult for them to

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:14.930 
this I think he's difficult for them to
do<00:04:11.610> that<00:04:13.040> how<00:04:14.040> about<00:04:14.220> a<00:04:14.250> second<00:04:14.640> to<00:04:14.700> put<00:04:14.819> this
