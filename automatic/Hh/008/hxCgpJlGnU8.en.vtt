in the front which is really nice

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:55.150

00:02:57.160 --> 00:02:57.170 
really cool about it is that it's not

00:02:57.170 --> 00:02:59.740 
really cool about it is that it's not
going<00:02:57.560> to<00:02:57.799> like<00:02:57.950> show<00:02:58.250> your<00:02:58.519> butt<00:02:58.760> which<00:02:59.329> a<00:02:59.570> lot

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:01.539 
going to like show your butt which a lot
of<00:02:59.780> skirts<00:03:00.110> I<00:03:00.320> feel<00:03:00.560> like<00:03:00.709> they<00:03:01.250> don't<00:03:01.400> really

00:03:01.539 --> 00:03:01.549 
of skirts I feel like they don't really

00:03:01.549 --> 00:03:02.710 
of skirts I feel like they don't really
like<00:03:01.790> we're<00:03:02.120> designing<00:03:02.329> it<00:03:02.570> they<00:03:02.660> don't

00:03:02.710 --> 00:03:02.720 
like we're designing it they don't

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:04.840 
like we're designing it they don't
really<00:03:02.930> take<00:03:03.110> that<00:03:03.140> into<00:03:04.040> consideration<00:03:04.070> and

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:04.850 
really take that into consideration and

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:07.660 
really take that into consideration and
like<00:03:05.840> I'm<00:03:05.989> not<00:03:06.140> someone<00:03:06.410> with<00:03:06.590> a<00:03:06.620> large<00:03:06.920> behind

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:07.670 
like I'm not someone with a large behind

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:08.290 
like I'm not someone with a large behind
or<00:03:07.880> anything

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:08.300 
or anything

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:10.480 
or anything
like<00:03:08.420> that<00:03:08.600> but<00:03:08.960> it<00:03:09.500> still<00:03:09.860> helps<00:03:10.070> when<00:03:10.340> it's

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:10.490 
like that but it still helps when it's

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:12.730 
like that but it still helps when it's
longer<00:03:10.880> and<00:03:10.910> it's<00:03:11.210> not<00:03:11.390> like<00:03:11.600> I'll<00:03:12.080> show<00:03:12.410> and

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:12.740 
longer and it's not like I'll show and

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:13.660 
longer and it's not like I'll show and

table so the first thing i got was

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:53.170 
table so the first thing i got was
something<00:03:50.060> that<00:03:50.090> I<00:03:50.800> never<00:03:51.800> told<00:03:52.670> myself<00:03:52.820> I<00:03:53.060> did

00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:53.180 
something that I never told myself I did

something that I never told myself I did
not<00:03:53.300> need<00:03:53.450> any<00:03:53.690> more<00:03:53.840> of<00:03:53.960> these<00:03:54.080> especially<00:03:54.440> in

00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:54.710 
not need any more of these especially in

00:03:54.710 --> 00:03:57.100 
not need any more of these especially in
this<00:03:54.800> color<00:03:55.040> but<00:03:55.700> I<00:03:55.940> I<00:03:56.180> couldn't<00:03:57.020> resist

00:03:57.100 --> 00:03:57.110 
this color but I I couldn't resist

00:03:57.110 --> 00:03:58.720 
this color but I I couldn't resist
because<00:03:57.470> it<00:03:57.740> is<00:03:57.830> a<00:03:57.860> little<00:03:58.040> bit<00:03:58.160> different<00:03:58.520> so

00:03:58.720 --> 00:03:58.730 
because it is a little bit different so

00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:01.690 
because it is a little bit different so
this<00:03:59.120> is<00:03:59.300> what<00:03:59.990> it<00:04:00.170> looks<00:04:00.440> like<00:04:00.740> and<00:04:01.190> this<00:04:01.280> is

00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:01.700 
this is what it looks like and this is

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:04.750 
this is what it looks like and this is
the<00:04:02.030> back<00:04:02.390> but<00:04:03.140> the<00:04:03.320> reason<00:04:03.560> why<00:04:03.980> I<00:04:04.010> wanted

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:04.760 
the back but the reason why I wanted

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:06.940 
the back but the reason why I wanted
this<00:04:04.880> one<00:04:05.120> so<00:04:05.720> badly<00:04:05.960> was<00:04:06.320> because<00:04:06.620> it's

00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:06.950 
this one so badly was because it's

00:04:06.950 --> 00:04:08.980 
this one so badly was because it's
really<00:04:07.370> long<00:04:07.730> and<00:04:08.090> I<00:04:08.690> thought<00:04:08.870> it'd<00:04:08.960> be

00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:08.990 
really long and I thought it'd be

00:04:08.990 --> 00:04:11.530 
really long and I thought it'd be
perfect<00:04:09.260> to<00:04:09.680> wear<00:04:09.710> with<00:04:09.920> skirts<00:04:10.730> and<00:04:11.150> what

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:11.540 
perfect to wear with skirts and what

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:13.660 
perfect to wear with skirts and what
dresses<00:04:11.780> this<00:04:12.140> cardigan<00:04:12.560> was<00:04:12.950> eighty<00:04:13.310> dollars

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:13.670 
dresses this cardigan was eighty dollars

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:16.120 
dresses this cardigan was eighty dollars
but<00:04:13.850> i<00:04:13.910> believe<00:04:14.090> it<00:04:14.600> was<00:04:14.750> only<00:04:15.230> fifty<00:04:15.739> dollars

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:16.130 
but i believe it was only fifty dollars

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:17.860 
but i believe it was only fifty dollars
i<00:04:16.400> think<00:04:16.609> they<00:04:16.730> had<00:04:16.850> like<00:04:17.000> a<00:04:17.030> sale<00:04:17.390> going<00:04:17.419> on

00:04:17.860 --> 00:04:17.870 
i think they had like a sale going on

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:20.140 
i think they had like a sale going on
and<00:04:18.200> then<00:04:18.350> the<00:04:18.500> next<00:04:18.530> us<00:04:19.070> whatever<00:04:19.580> cardigan

so i got this in a medium so that it was
like<00:04:49.910> a<00:04:49.940> little<00:04:50.090> bit<00:04:50.300> more<00:04:50.419> like<00:04:50.630> comfy<00:04:51.050> cozy

me as much as milk chocolate us so I'm

00:07:29.130 --> 00:07:30.680 
me as much as milk chocolate us so I'm
not<00:07:29.280> exactly<00:07:29.430> sure<00:07:29.730> how<00:07:30.060> that<00:07:30.240> works<00:07:30.360> so<00:07:30.630> I

not exactly sure how that works so I

00:07:30.690 --> 00:07:32.330 
not exactly sure how that works so I
feel<00:07:30.990> like<00:07:31.110> it<00:07:31.230> would<00:07:31.320> be<00:07:31.350> the<00:07:31.500> opposite<00:07:31.920> so<00:07:32.310> I

00:07:32.330 --> 00:07:32.340 
feel like it would be the opposite so I

00:07:32.340 --> 00:07:33.830 
feel like it would be the opposite so I
