00:00:02.210 --> 00:00:07.740
 exceptional condition on the hindenburg dam 

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:10.200
 Nearly 600 operational forces from the mainland and 

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:12.809
 from the island sylt have in the night 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:15.960
 from saturday to sunday the seriousness 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:18.420
 rehearsed on the spot were fire departments that 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:21.320
 German Red Cross Rescue Services 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:25.439
 police and many other organizations 

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:28.320
 we accident scenario hiring 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:31.289
 accident with 80 injured as a total 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:34.110
 about half of it has to be done again 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:35.670
 lying partially transported 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:37.290
 These are high by helicopters 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:39.809
 so desired by the air rescue 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:41.219
 rescued and transported away but the 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:43.320
 mostly by a medical 

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:44.850
 lifeline the railroad track is here 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:48.110
 the only way we actually go for that 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:51.559
 can represent injured transport 

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:53.670
 The aim of the exercise was that of 2011 

00:00:51.559 --> 00:00:56.160
 published operational concept for 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:58.859
 emergencies on hindenburgdamm on his 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:00.870
 to check practicability as in 

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:03.000
 concept provided first met the 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:03.570
 Assistance from the island at the accident site 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.510
 on 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:09.930
 Police and rescue workers followed 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:12.930
 from the mainland about 80 actors mimed 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:14.820
 the victims realistically the injured 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:17.250
 were first supplied and with a 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:20.070
 requested medical rescue train 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:21.200
 to the furnished treatment place 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:23.310
 niebÃ¼ll brought 

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:25.080
 especially seriously injured were with 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:27.090
 flown out of the helicopter 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:28.710
 After about three and a half hours everyone was 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:31.590
 supplied patients and the 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:35.009
 emergency situation on the hindenburg dam 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:37.159
 mastered the conclusion the night was 

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:40.020
 of course very exciting for me 

00:01:37.159 --> 00:01:42.270
 but she was also very successful 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:43.140
 pleasing to me personally because I 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:46.590
 found 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:48.479
 the concept takes hold and that means 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:49.470
 not that we do not ask a few 

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:50.850
 where we have a bit more 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:52.380
 have to rectify 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:53.850
 We also wanted that through this exercise 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:55.320
 achieve because only so you can 

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:56.310
 in the end as well, in fact 

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:57.970
 within the overall concept 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:00.370
 improve accordingly 

00:01:57.970 --> 00:02:02.190
 It was the biggest rescue exercise 

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:04.600
 so far in schleswig-holstein 

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:07.320
 took place on the basis of 

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:09.910
 Findings should be the operational concept now 

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:12.790
 be revised in the event of a 

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:15.820
 In case of emergency, the processes are optimal 

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:18.000
 work because then each counts 

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:18.000
 minute
