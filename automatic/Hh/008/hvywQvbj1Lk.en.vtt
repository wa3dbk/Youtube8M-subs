okay<00:00:02.310> so<00:00:02.370> here<00:00:02.760> I<00:00:02.790> have<00:00:02.909> my<00:00:03.449> first<00:00:03.810> video<00:00:05.480> and<00:00:06.480> I

00:00:06.829 --> 00:00:06.839 
okay so here I have my first video and I

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:10.330 
okay so here I have my first video and I
thought<00:00:07.020> I'd<00:00:07.170> make<00:00:07.350> it<00:00:07.379> about<00:00:07.740> pool<00:00:08.309> heating

00:00:10.330 --> 00:00:10.340 
thought I'd make it about pool heating

00:00:10.340 --> 00:00:17.529 
thought I'd make it about pool heating
gum<00:00:11.340> a<00:00:11.370> little<00:00:11.730> redneck<00:00:12.360> pool<00:00:12.630> here<00:00:13.610> and

00:00:17.539 --> 00:00:19.640 

seeing<00:00:18.539> that<00:00:18.630> there's<00:00:18.840> a<00:00:18.869> lot<00:00:19.050> of<00:00:19.080> debate<00:00:19.410> as

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:19.650 
seeing that there's a lot of debate as

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:22.870 
seeing that there's a lot of debate as
to<00:00:19.680> people<00:00:20.310> wanting<00:00:20.760> a<00:00:20.820> cold<00:00:21.090> pool<00:00:21.390> hot<00:00:21.720> pool

to people wanting a cold pool hot pool

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:25.670 
to people wanting a cold pool hot pool
it's<00:00:23.880> strictly<00:00:24.240> personal<00:00:24.480> preference<00:00:25.199> me

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:25.680 
it's strictly personal preference me

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:28.040 
it's strictly personal preference me
I<00:00:25.710> don't<00:00:26.130> like<00:00:26.250> ice-cold<00:00:26.670> pools<00:00:27.000> for<00:00:27.900> that

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:28.050 
I don't like ice-cold pools for that

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:29.929 
I don't like ice-cold pools for that
I'll<00:00:28.289> go<00:00:28.470> jump<00:00:28.740> in<00:00:28.890> a<00:00:28.949> lake<00:00:28.980> or<00:00:29.400> in<00:00:29.429> a<00:00:29.550> river<00:00:29.760> if

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:29.939 
I'll go jump in a lake or in a river if

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:33.500 
I'll go jump in a lake or in a river if
I<00:00:30.029> wanted<00:00:30.300> a<00:00:30.390> cold<00:00:30.630> pool<00:00:32.180> then<00:00:33.180> looking<00:00:33.390> at

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:33.510 
I wanted a cold pool then looking at

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:35.360 
I wanted a cold pool then looking at
several<00:00:33.750> different<00:00:33.870> options<00:00:34.500> here<00:00:35.160> as<00:00:35.250> you

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:35.370 
several different options here as you

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:37.040 
several different options here as you
can<00:00:35.399> look<00:00:35.760> at<00:00:35.910> the<00:00:36.030> bottom<00:00:36.329> of<00:00:36.420> the<00:00:36.540> pool<00:00:36.750> looks

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.050 
can look at the bottom of the pool looks

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:40.670 
can look at the bottom of the pool looks
like<00:00:37.200> I<00:00:37.290> got<00:00:37.440> UFOs<00:00:38.040> in<00:00:38.309> there<00:00:39.469> those<00:00:40.469> are

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:40.680 
like I got UFOs in there those are

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:43.880 
like I got UFOs in there those are
actually<00:00:41.219> industrial<00:00:42.120> grade<00:00:42.780> rubber<00:00:43.469> mats

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890 
actually industrial grade rubber mats

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:47.930 
actually industrial grade rubber mats
they<00:00:44.640> came<00:00:44.910> out<00:00:44.940> of<00:00:45.980> the<00:00:46.980> back<00:00:47.190> end<00:00:47.430> of<00:00:47.640> some

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
they came out of the back end of some

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:52.580 
they came out of the back end of some
Hummers<00:00:48.719> and<00:00:50.539> I'd<00:00:51.539> say<00:00:51.840> they're<00:00:52.170> good<00:00:52.440> about

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:52.590 
Hummers and I'd say they're good about

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:54.799 
Hummers and I'd say they're good about
half-inch<00:00:53.129> thick<00:00:53.370> industrial<00:00:54.000> grade<00:00:54.570> rubber

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
half-inch thick industrial grade rubber

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:59.299 
half-inch thick industrial grade rubber
mats<00:00:55.399> anyway<00:00:56.870> it's<00:00:57.870> roughly<00:00:58.440> about<00:00:58.590> ninety

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
mats anyway it's roughly about ninety

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:11.520 
mats anyway it's roughly about ninety
degrees<00:00:59.789> here<00:01:00.629> in<00:01:00.719> Florida<00:01:01.199> right<00:01:01.920> now<00:01:01.980> and

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:11.530 

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:17.950 

redneck<00:01:12.530> thermometer<00:01:13.100> set<00:01:13.370> up<00:01:13.520> here<00:01:16.960> let's

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:17.960 
redneck thermometer set up here let's

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:19.810 
redneck thermometer set up here let's
see<00:01:18.350> if<00:01:18.410> I<00:01:18.530> can<00:01:18.710> get<00:01:18.890> a<00:01:18.920> better<00:01:19.130> shot<00:01:19.460> there<00:01:19.700> we

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:19.820 
see if I can get a better shot there we

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:29.760 
see if I can get a better shot there we
go

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:29.770 

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:32.609 

so<00:01:30.369> we've<00:01:30.520> got<00:01:30.670> roughly<00:01:30.939> 90<00:01:31.659> 91<00:01:32.200> degrees

00:01:32.609 --> 00:01:32.619 
so we've got roughly 90 91 degrees

00:01:32.619 --> 00:01:36.510 
so we've got roughly 90 91 degrees
temperature<00:01:33.399> in<00:01:33.610> the<00:01:33.880> water<00:01:34.210> and<00:01:35.250> this<00:01:36.250> has

00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:36.520 
temperature in the water and this has

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:38.999 
temperature in the water and this has
absolutely<00:01:36.850> no<00:01:37.570> help<00:01:37.840> other<00:01:38.110> than<00:01:38.350> them<00:01:38.590> three

00:01:38.999 --> 00:01:39.009 
absolutely no help other than them three

00:01:39.009 --> 00:01:40.679 
absolutely no help other than them three
mats<00:01:39.280> that<00:01:39.460> are<00:01:39.580> in<00:01:39.790> there<00:01:39.970> each<00:01:40.180> matter<00:01:40.479> is

00:01:40.679 --> 00:01:40.689 
mats that are in there each matter is

00:01:40.689 --> 00:01:45.210 
mats that are in there each matter is
roughly<00:01:40.960> about<00:01:41.110> 3/5<00:01:41.680> by<00:01:41.890> 3<00:01:42.159> foot<00:01:43.979> basic<00:01:44.979> theory

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:45.220 
roughly about 3/5 by 3 foot basic theory

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:47.520 
roughly about 3/5 by 3 foot basic theory
behind<00:01:45.399> this<00:01:45.789> pool<00:01:46.570> gets<00:01:46.840> a<00:01:46.930> lot<00:01:47.110> of<00:01:47.140> Sun

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:47.530 
behind this pool gets a lot of Sun

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:49.080 
behind this pool gets a lot of Sun
during<00:01:47.770> the<00:01:47.979> day

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:49.090 
during the day

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:52.020 
during the day
it<00:01:49.600> beats<00:01:49.810> down<00:01:50.049> on<00:01:50.409> that<00:01:51.130> black<00:01:51.429> mat<00:01:51.700> that

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:52.030 
it beats down on that black mat that

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:54.749 
it beats down on that black mat that
black<00:01:52.270> mat<00:01:52.539> in<00:01:52.990> turn<00:01:53.679> starts<00:01:54.100> to<00:01:54.250> absorb<00:01:54.340> the

00:02:04.309 --> 00:02:04.319 
two of them average temperature was

00:02:04.319 --> 00:02:10.590 
two of them average temperature was
roughly<00:02:05.319> I<00:02:06.869> would<00:02:07.869> say<00:02:09.179> kept<00:02:10.179> it<00:02:10.299> right<00:02:10.450> around

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:10.600 
roughly I would say kept it right around

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:15.650 
roughly I would say kept it right around
85<00:02:11.290> 87<00:02:11.709> degrees<00:02:12.069> decided<00:02:12.580> to<00:02:12.670> add<00:02:12.850> a<00:02:12.910> third<00:02:13.360> one

best temperature I've been able to
record<00:02:18.610> on<00:02:18.850> here<00:02:19.299> was<00:02:19.660> 95<00:02:20.260> degrees<00:02:20.680> the<00:02:20.890> other

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:21.040
