00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:04.410
 tender all the youtube band this 

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:06.660
 upload of grace is good in this video 

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:09.090
 I bring you a complete list of all 

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:13.710
 the tweets that are currently 

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:15.180
 compatible with ios to 6.1 in the 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:17.220
 description of this video I'm going to 

00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:21.449
 leave the link what I liked about this 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:25.440
 page is that all the 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:27.359
 days for example if in this tweet for 

00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:29.960
 today is not compatible yet 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:32.460
 but tomorrow comes a new update 

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:34.920
 this page is also going to update 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:38.339
 to show that also that tweet 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:39.690
 now it is compatible and good is one of 

00:00:38.339 --> 00:00:42.749
 the things that I do not like about the page 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:46.769
 is that for the moment is so saturated 

00:00:42.749 --> 00:00:49.949
 of people if for example they open it and 

00:00:46.769 --> 00:00:53.069
 he tells them that his servers are 

00:00:49.949 --> 00:00:55.679
 busy try one more time and 

00:00:53.069 --> 00:00:59.010
 until they succeed but I'm also going 

00:00:55.679 --> 00:01:02.429
 to leave this a compressed file of 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:06.210
 of the list that brings the page equal in 

00:01:02.429 --> 00:01:07.170
 microsoft word are more than 300 tweets 200 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:12.890
 tweets I think 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:15.830
 and how do you see this in what is this 

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:19.490
 to shaded in green are all 

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:22.340
 tweets that are already compatible with the 

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:25.100
 6.1 audio those that are in shaded 

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:28.190
 in red are the tweets that still 

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:30.670
 they are not compatible with that I is and 

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:33.800
 it also tells us the price 

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:35.950
 from tweet and it also tells us this if 

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:39.460
 it's free 

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:41.259
 and those are all quite enough that I 

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:41.710
 used also quite is that of 

00:01:41.259 --> 00:01:43.659
 wright 

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:46.750
 at the moment saying tweak is not 

00:01:43.659 --> 00:01:49.929
 compatible and I'm going to leave these two 

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:52.179
 links the page if there is not the 

00:01:49.929 --> 00:01:54.850
 error try again and also they 

00:01:52.179 --> 00:01:57.850
 I will also leave a compressed file 

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:59.790
 in microsoft word of the listing of these 

00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:02.070
 tweets 

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:05.130
 and there are all the tweets already 

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:06.750
 compatible with the 6.1 audio and the 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:09.570
 that are not icons yet I say this 

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:12.150
 page is updated every day is 

00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:14.010
 well I hope you found this video useful 

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:16.440

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:19.500
 they thanked the video and I know that 

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:20.970
 to discover how the striped but there 

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:23.510
