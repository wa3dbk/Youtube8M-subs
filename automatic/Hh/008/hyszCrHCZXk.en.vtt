00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:18.060 
across here with a piece of 10 all the

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:19.760 
across here with a piece of 10 all the
way<00:00:18.150> across<00:00:18.240> that<00:00:18.449> front<00:00:18.930> edge<00:00:19.109> you<00:00:19.560> don't

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:19.770 
way across that front edge you don't

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:21.109 
way across that front edge you don't
have<00:00:19.890> to<00:00:20.010> figure<00:00:20.220> out<00:00:20.400> what<00:00:20.580> I<00:00:20.609> want<00:00:20.820> to<00:00:20.880> do<00:00:21.000> on

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:21.119 
have to figure out what I want to do on

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:24.070 
have to figure out what I want to do on
the<00:00:21.240> back<00:00:21.420> edge<00:00:21.660> I<00:00:21.930> got<00:00:22.529> one<00:00:22.769> long<00:00:23.070> piece<00:00:23.400> here

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:24.080 
the back edge I got one long piece here

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:27.620 
the back edge I got one long piece here
but<00:00:25.080> i<00:00:25.170> think<00:00:25.380> i<00:00:25.470> might<00:00:25.590> cut<00:00:25.949> it<00:00:26.070> anyway<00:00:26.630> this

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:27.630 
but i think i might cut it anyway this

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:29.779 
but i think i might cut it anyway this
19<00:00:28.170> feet<00:00:28.439> long<00:00:28.470> but<00:00:28.890> it's<00:00:28.980> got<00:00:29.130> some<00:00:29.340> breakage

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:29.789 
19 feet long but it's got some breakage

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:33.530 
19 feet long but it's got some breakage
down<00:00:30.060> here<00:00:30.359> about<00:00:30.480> four<00:00:30.869> feet<00:00:31.140> in<00:00:31.199> and<00:00:32.239> i<00:00:33.239> would

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:33.540 
down here about four feet in and i would

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:35.420 
down here about four feet in and i would
need<00:00:33.750> 16<00:00:34.320> for<00:00:34.590> it<00:00:34.649> to<00:00:34.710> go<00:00:34.829> all<00:00:35.010> the<00:00:35.100> way<00:00:35.130> so<00:00:35.280> i

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:35.430 
need 16 for it to go all the way so i

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:37.250 
need 16 for it to go all the way so i
think<00:00:35.489> what<00:00:35.670> i'm<00:00:35.790> gonna<00:00:35.910> do<00:00:36.059> is<00:00:36.090> throw<00:00:37.079> these

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260 
think what i'm gonna do is throw these

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:40.340 
think what i'm gonna do is throw these
other<00:00:37.530> pieces<00:00:37.770> up<00:00:38.129> on<00:00:38.340> there<00:00:38.690> and<00:00:39.690> then<00:00:39.750> once<00:00:40.230> i

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350 
other pieces up on there and then once i

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:41.569 
other pieces up on there and then once i
figure<00:00:40.590> out<00:00:40.620> what<00:00:40.800> happened<00:00:41.100> peace<00:00:41.280> out

00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:41.579 
figure out what happened peace out

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:43.819 
figure out what happened peace out
rather<00:00:42.570> than<00:00:42.750> cutting<00:00:43.020> this<00:00:43.260> and<00:00:43.559> cut<00:00:43.739> into

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829 
rather than cutting this and cut into

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:45.290 
rather than cutting this and cut into
the<00:00:44.010> peace<00:00:44.219> corps<00:00:44.250> it<00:00:44.579> i<00:00:44.640> may<00:00:44.789> want<00:00:44.969> to<00:00:45.059> cut

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300 
the peace corps it i may want to cut

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:47.720 
the peace corps it i may want to cut
another<00:00:45.390> from<00:00:45.719> small<00:00:45.989> pieces<00:00:46.260> to<00:00:46.590> fit<00:00:46.800> but

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.730 
another from small pieces to fit but

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:49.520 
another from small pieces to fit but
i'll<00:00:48.120> just<00:00:48.329> start<00:00:48.570> then<00:00:48.930> i'll<00:00:49.140> go<00:00:49.170> over<00:00:49.320> the

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530 
i'll just start then i'll go over the

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:52.639 
i'll just start then i'll go over the
top<00:00:49.739> of<00:00:49.950> a<00:00:50.100> half<00:00:50.340> and<00:00:50.700> anila<00:00:51.320> go<00:00:52.320> to<00:00:52.379> the<00:00:52.530> other

from 10 I'm the glove spark shall always
like<00:00:59.699> looking<00:00:59.730> sparks<00:01:00.449> don't<00:01:00.690> you<00:01:00.840> but<00:01:01.230> you

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
like looking sparks don't you but you

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:29.280 
like looking sparks don't you but you
like<00:01:01.590> it

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:29.290 

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:32.230 

ok<00:01:30.290> then<00:01:30.470> I<00:01:30.590> got<00:01:30.770> a<00:01:30.800> layer<00:01:31.010> of<00:01:31.040> roof<00:01:31.400> each<00:01:31.610> all

00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:32.240 
ok then I got a layer of roof each all

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:34.810 
ok then I got a layer of roof each all
the<00:01:32.420> way<00:01:32.510> across<00:01:32.570> the<00:01:33.020> lower<00:01:33.200> side<00:01:33.520> I'm<00:01:34.520> gonna

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:34.820 
the way across the lower side I'm gonna

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:37.090 
the way across the lower side I'm gonna
put<00:01:34.910> the<00:01:35.300> screws<00:01:35.600> in<00:01:35.750> it<00:01:35.840> before<00:01:36.650> the<00:01:36.920> wind

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:37.100 
put the screws in it before the wind

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:39.430 
put the screws in it before the wind
blows<00:01:37.340> it<00:01:37.520> off<00:01:37.670> it<00:01:38.660> worked<00:01:38.840> out<00:01:38.960> real<00:01:39.230> good<00:01:39.380> i

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:39.440 
blows it off it worked out real good i

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:42.430 
blows it off it worked out real good i
use<00:01:39.830> that<00:01:39.860> to<00:01:40.400> kind<00:01:41.390> of<00:01:41.510> readjust<00:01:41.810> the<00:01:42.230> build

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:42.440 
use that to kind of readjust the build

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:45.220 
use that to kind of readjust the build
and<00:01:42.590> then<00:01:42.710> get<00:01:42.860> it<00:01:42.980> Square<00:01:43.310> and<00:01:43.360> I<00:01:44.360> think<00:01:45.110> a

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:45.230 
and then get it Square and I think a

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:46.990 
and then get it Square and I think a
good<00:01:45.260> square<00:01:45.680> now<00:01:45.920> and<00:01:46.250> I've<00:01:46.400> just<00:01:46.430> priced<00:01:46.850> it

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:47.000 
good square now and I've just priced it

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:48.310 
good square now and I've just priced it
up<00:01:47.120> real<00:01:47.270> emotion<00:01:47.660> so<00:01:47.750> I'm<00:01:47.810> going<00:01:47.960> to<00:01:47.990> be<00:01:48.110> up<00:01:48.170> on

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:48.320 
up real emotion so I'm going to be up on

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:51.910 
up real emotion so I'm going to be up on
the<00:01:48.440> roof<00:01:48.620> I<00:01:48.890> don't<00:01:49.730> want<00:01:49.850> it
