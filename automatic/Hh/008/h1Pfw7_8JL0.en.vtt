00:00:03.710 --> 00:00:16.289
 game channel pixel world 

00:00:05.810 --> 00:00:18.810
 represents the company well done on 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:21.210
 surprise survivable engine surs on which 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:23.160
 lovers still create games despite 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:24.300
 on all its imperfections and pretty 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:26.400
 advanced age 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:29.070
 one of these games was the project stanley 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:31.080
 parable released late last year i 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:31.740
 for a long time could not understand what is it 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:34.050
 for the genre 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:36.000
 This quest is some kind of mystic like 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:38.489
 It turned out that this is a hodgepodge of these concepts 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:41.040
 as the name suggests this is a parable 

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:43.079
 Nickname employees of a certain company 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:46.260
 who have been doing their whole life so that 

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:47.969
 sat his close office at number 427 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:49.860
 and pressed the buttons in the computer 

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:51.930
 information about them came down from above 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:54.690
 Stanley always perform without question 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:56.969
 directions here one day 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:59.430
 stands found that he is quite 

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:00.090
 one on the whole and even buildings like then 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:02.730
 It revealed 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:05.320
 one he was generally in the whole office of the firm and 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:07.150
 here the gameplay itself begins 

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:09.130
 that just like before I told 

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:11.080
 you get behind the scenes of the game at this time 

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:13.240
 hear the voice of the narrator he will 

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:15.490
 our invisible companion commenting 

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:17.320
 each action stands directing it along 

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:19.510
 the way the game is based on this and the whole 

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:21.670
 the gameplay is all building filled with various 

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:23.740
 in some places dina have to make a choice 

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:26.380
 for example you are steering in a new room we 

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:28.990
 we see two doors leading from her voice 

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:31.000
 says that the walls allegedly chose the left and 

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:33.369
 can either go on about the story 

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:35.229
 either go to the right addiction door 

00:01:33.369 --> 00:01:37.660
 from our choices the scenery changes and 

00:01:35.229 --> 00:01:39.820
 narratives providing all new and 

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:41.740
 new fork in the way of stanley 

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:43.899
 say that the main story in the game 

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:45.820
 short it is nothing to say if 

00:01:43.899 --> 00:01:47.770
 follow the instructions of the narrator that is 

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:49.210
 turning in the right direction and pressing 

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:51.009
 on those buttons that we pointed out 

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:53.020
 the game can be completed in exactly four seconds. 

00:01:51.009 --> 00:01:54.789
 half minutes in this time we will find out 

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:56.350
 what's each employee's office is 

00:01:54.789 --> 00:01:58.420
 separate duplicated cell for 

00:01:56.350 --> 00:02:00.460
 which is always video surveillance 

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:02.050
 and on the lower floors of the building is located 

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:04.210
 mind control machine 

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:06.820
 disabling her stands can get out on 

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:08.860
 the will of the scenery that looks awful 

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:10.660
 on the bologna engine until we find out 

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:12.670
 where did all the people go? 

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:14.799
 the building who is this mysterious storyteller 

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:16.510
 that in general it is going on clear what 

00:02:14.799 --> 00:02:18.370
 after the first passage we are instantly 

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:20.709
 come back but only this 

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:22.390
 just do not follow the canonical history 

00:02:20.709 --> 00:02:24.070
 as a result, we find a completely new 

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:25.870
 the rooms are completely different 

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:28.420
 situations and start looking at 

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:30.190
 implicated 200 new perspective by itself 

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:32.049
 tell all the plot twist I'm not 

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:34.329
 I will become because it is such a game where 

00:02:32.049 --> 00:02:36.579
 everyone must find all the answers by himself 

00:02:34.329 --> 00:02:38.670
 and besides, the truth can everyone 

00:02:36.579 --> 00:02:41.019
 to form its own 

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:43.030
 the most interesting thing about this game is 

00:02:41.019 --> 00:02:45.250
 ever changing situation in 

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:47.560
 depending on your choice and reaction 

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:49.540
 invisible satellite offscreen begins 

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:51.489
 just a hell of a player troll 

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:53.470
 we are told to go one way first 

00:02:51.489 --> 00:02:55.269
 listen then turn back 

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:57.220
 come back and do it a little bit 

00:02:55.269 --> 00:02:58.989
 whether not every situation from this announcer 

00:02:57.220 --> 00:03:00.850
 naturally mad that looks well 

00:02:58.989 --> 00:03:02.560
 very funny then selling may 

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:04.510
 throw some very nasty 

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:06.520
 thing as a result of such actions we 

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:08.890
 can see about 15 different 

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:10.600
 endings and even more who knows the game 

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:13.450
 Need to thoroughly delve to find 

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:15.150
 all similar moments stanley parable 

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:17.950
 will definitely like the fans 

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:19.900
 half-life port club as well as those who 

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:21.820
 loves playing with the second but here already 

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:23.380
 don't look at the graphics at all 

00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:25.600
 minimum costs the authors have been able 

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:27.430
 create a nice location inside edition 

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:30.070
 and the voice of the narrator is great 

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:32.260
