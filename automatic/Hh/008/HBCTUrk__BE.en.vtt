00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219 
besides feeling for a burr on both sides

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:01.250 
besides feeling for a burr on both sides
of<00:00:59.399> the<00:00:59.460> knife<00:00:59.670> and<00:01:00.510> when<00:01:00.719> you<00:01:00.809> feel<00:01:00.989> for<00:01:01.199> a

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
of the knife and when you feel for a

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:02.930 
of the knife and when you feel for a
barrier<00:01:01.469> you<00:01:01.500> want<00:01:01.680> to<00:01:01.770> run<00:01:01.890> your<00:01:02.039> finger<00:01:02.370> up

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:05.539 
barrier you want to run your finger up
across<00:01:03.359> the<00:01:03.690> edge<00:01:03.809> never<00:01:04.170> into<00:01:04.589> it<00:01:04.710> and<00:01:04.860> never

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549 
across the edge never into it and never

there the test we're going to do today

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:24.710 
there the test we're going to do today
is<00:01:23.159> what<00:01:23.340> I<00:01:23.369> call<00:01:23.549> my<00:01:23.580> thumbnail<00:01:24.119> test<00:01:24.450> and

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720 
is what I call my thumbnail test and

is what I call my thumbnail test and
this<00:01:25.080> is<00:01:25.170> a<00:01:25.259> common<00:01:25.560> test<00:01:25.740> you<00:01:25.979> can<00:01:26.100> see<00:01:26.280> done

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:28.490 
this is a common test you can see done
in<00:01:26.610> Japan<00:01:26.729> you<00:01:27.720> also<00:01:27.869> see<00:01:28.140> a<00:01:28.170> lot<00:01:28.229> of<00:01:28.350> people

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.500 
in Japan you also see a lot of people

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:30.649 
in Japan you also see a lot of people
test<00:01:28.829> on<00:01:28.979> their<00:01:29.100> hair<00:01:29.250> but<00:01:29.490> as<00:01:29.700> I'm<00:01:30.180> starting

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:30.659 
test on their hair but as I'm starting

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:32.510 
test on their hair but as I'm starting
to<00:01:30.930> evolve<00:01:31.200> that<00:01:31.470> scares<00:01:31.740> me<00:01:31.829> a<00:01:31.950> little<00:01:32.070> bit<00:01:32.220> so

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520 
to evolve that scares me a little bit so

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:35.090 
to evolve that scares me a little bit so
I<00:01:32.670> use<00:01:33.090> the<00:01:33.240> thumbnail<00:01:33.479> test<00:01:33.930> instead<00:01:34.320> and<00:01:34.560> the

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100 
I use the thumbnail test instead and the

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:37.280 
I use the thumbnail test instead and the
way<00:01:35.220> the<00:01:35.400> thumbnail<00:01:35.759> test<00:01:36.060> works<00:01:36.299> is<00:01:36.540> this<00:01:36.720> you

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:37.290 
way the thumbnail test works is this you

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:39.289 
way the thumbnail test works is this you
take<00:01:37.530> your<00:01:37.740> knife<00:01:37.950> and<00:01:37.979> you<00:01:38.310> put<00:01:38.670> it<00:01:38.759> against

it's<00:02:54.430> just<00:02:54.459> rounded<00:02:55.030> over<00:02:55.269> and<00:02:55.390> is<00:02:55.510> sliding

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:55.900 
it's just rounded over and is sliding

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:59.160 
it's just rounded over and is sliding
over<00:02:56.140> things<00:02:56.400> and<00:02:57.510> so<00:02:58.510> those<00:02:58.659> are<00:02:58.810> two<00:02:58.930> things

00:02:59.160 --> 00:02:59.170 
over things and so those are two things

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:01.349 
over things and so those are two things
to<00:02:59.260> kind<00:02:59.530> of<00:02:59.590> be<00:02:59.769> cautious<00:03:00.220> of<00:03:00.430> again<00:03:01.120> as<00:03:01.299> I

00:03:01.349 --> 00:03:01.359 
to kind of be cautious of again as I

00:03:01.359 --> 00:03:02.550 
to kind of be cautious of again as I
mentioned<00:03:01.540> the<00:03:01.930> beginning<00:03:02.200> of<00:03:02.349> this<00:03:02.409> video

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:02.560 
mentioned the beginning of this video

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:04.289 
mentioned the beginning of this video
this<00:03:02.890> isn't<00:03:03.129> an<00:03:03.250> end-all<00:03:03.549> be-all<00:03:03.609> test<00:03:04.150> of

00:03:04.289 --> 00:03:04.299 
this isn't an end-all be-all test of

00:03:04.299 --> 00:03:05.849 
this isn't an end-all be-all test of
things<00:03:04.510> it's<00:03:04.720> an<00:03:04.870> easy<00:03:05.170> way<00:03:05.409> to<00:03:05.440> gauge

00:03:05.849 --> 00:03:05.859 
things it's an easy way to gauge

00:03:05.859 --> 00:03:08.280 
things it's an easy way to gauge
something<00:03:06.340> and<00:03:07.269> give<00:03:07.510> you<00:03:07.599> an<00:03:07.690> idea<00:03:07.840> of<00:03:08.109> where

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:08.290 
something and give you an idea of where

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:10.740 
something and give you an idea of where
you<00:03:08.409> stand<00:03:08.709> so<00:03:09.640> this<00:03:09.790> is<00:03:09.940> one<00:03:10.180> test<00:03:10.450> that<00:03:10.629> we're

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:10.750 
you stand so this is one test that we're

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:12.869 
you stand so this is one test that we're
doing<00:03:10.870> to<00:03:11.680> use<00:03:11.769> the<00:03:11.920> thumbnail<00:03:12.129> test<00:03:12.519> so<00:03:12.670> again

00:03:12.869 --> 00:03:12.879

00:03:42.089 --> 00:03:42.099 
my thumbnail for this test is I put the

00:03:42.099 --> 00:03:44.670 
my thumbnail for this test is I put the
edge<00:03:42.250> of<00:03:42.639> the<00:03:43.239> knife<00:03:43.419> down<00:03:43.870> against<00:03:44.560> my

edge of the knife down against my
thumbnail<00:03:45.449> and<00:03:46.449> then<00:03:46.900> I<00:03:47.109> rock<00:03:47.709> my<00:03:47.739> thumb

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:48.510 
thumbnail and then I rock my thumb

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:51.569 
thumbnail and then I rock my thumb
underneath<00:03:49.510> the<00:03:49.690> edge<00:03:49.840> and<00:03:50.169> when<00:03:51.129> I<00:03:51.160> do<00:03:51.280> this

00:03:51.569 --> 00:03:51.579 
underneath the edge and when I do this

00:03:51.579 --> 00:03:53.879 
underneath the edge and when I do this
kind<00:03:51.819> of<00:03:51.879> thing<00:03:52.120> there<00:03:52.660> will<00:03:52.810> be<00:03:52.840> some<00:03:53.169> flex<00:03:53.620> in

00:03:53.879 --> 00:03:53.889 
kind of thing there will be some flex in

00:03:53.889 --> 00:03:56.490 
kind of thing there will be some flex in
the<00:03:53.949> edge<00:03:54.280> and<00:03:54.639> the<00:03:55.329> amount<00:03:55.690> of<00:03:55.840> flex<00:03:56.169> that<00:03:56.379> I

00:03:56.490 --> 00:03:56.500 
the edge and the amount of flex that I

00:03:56.500 --> 00:03:57.960 
the edge and the amount of flex that I
see<00:03:56.709> will<00:03:56.980> tell<00:03:57.190> me<00:03:57.310> a<00:03:57.340> number<00:03:57.639> of<00:03:57.730> things

00:03:57.960 --> 00:03:57.970 
see will tell me a number of things

00:03:57.970 --> 00:04:00.059 
see will tell me a number of things
about<00:03:58.150> the<00:03:58.389> knife<00:03:58.540> the<00:03:59.440> first<00:03:59.709> thing<00:03:59.889> you<00:03:59.949> have

00:04:00.059 --> 00:04:00.069 
about the knife the first thing you have

00:04:00.069 --> 00:04:01.979 
about the knife the first thing you have
to<00:04:00.190> recognize<00:04:00.310> is<00:04:00.940> what<00:04:01.359> kind<00:04:01.569> of<00:04:01.629> knife<00:04:01.810> you

00:04:01.979 --> 00:04:01.989 
to recognize is what kind of knife you

00:04:01.989 --> 00:04:03.330 
to recognize is what kind of knife you
have<00:04:02.139> some<00:04:02.470> knives<00:04:02.709> are<00:04:02.949> made<00:04:02.980> to<00:04:03.250> have

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:03.340 
have some knives are made to have

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:05.610 
have some knives are made to have
thinner<00:04:03.549> edges<00:04:03.940> than<00:04:04.120> others<00:04:04.389> and<00:04:04.599> so<00:04:05.079> this

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:05.620 
thinner edges than others and so this

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:08.039 
thinner edges than others and so this
will<00:04:05.829> cause<00:04:06.010> flecks<00:04:06.459> to<00:04:06.669> vary<00:04:06.849> greatly<00:04:07.049> but

00:04:08.039 --> 00:04:08.049 
will cause flecks to vary greatly but

00:04:08.049 --> 00:04:09.569 
will cause flecks to vary greatly but
you<00:04:08.139> can<00:04:08.260> have<00:04:08.379> a<00:04:08.440> good<00:04:08.620> idea<00:04:08.949> that<00:04:09.010> you<00:04:09.190> toes

00:04:09.569 --> 00:04:09.579 
you can have a good idea that you toes

00:04:09.579 --> 00:04:12.240 
you can have a good idea that you toes
will<00:04:09.790> have<00:04:09.910> maybe<00:04:10.180> a<00:04:10.269> tiny<00:04:10.540> bit<00:04:10.660> of<00:04:10.870> flex<00:04:11.250> debes

will have maybe a tiny bit of flex debes

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:14.610 
will have maybe a tiny bit of flex debes

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:16.589 
will have very little lubos will have
probably<00:04:14.980> the<00:04:15.160> most<00:04:15.400> amount<00:04:15.669> of<00:04:15.849> flex

00:04:16.589 --> 00:04:16.599 
probably the most amount of flex

00:04:16.599 --> 00:04:19.379 
probably the most amount of flex
Yanagi<00:04:17.229> bugs<00:04:17.530> will<00:04:17.709> have<00:04:17.829> some<00:04:18.130> as<00:04:18.310> well<00:04:18.389> but

Yanagi bugs will have some as well but

00:04:19.389 --> 00:04:21.779

residual burr in which case you'll not

residual burr in which case you'll not
only<00:04:34.930> see<00:04:35.170> flex<00:04:35.680> but<00:04:35.860> you'll<00:04:36.040> see<00:04:36.190> part<00:04:36.370> of<00:04:36.490> the

edge flip up and stay there or it means
that<00:04:39.970> you've<00:04:40.090> ground<00:04:40.390> your<00:04:40.570> edge<00:04:40.720> too<00:04:41.080> thin

up to the kind of use that you would

up to the kind of use that you would
expect<00:04:44.260> from<00:04:44.380> this<00:04:44.620> knife<00:04:44.830> so<00:04:45.580> if<00:04:45.850> you're

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:46.000 
expect from this knife so if you're

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:48.030 
expect from this knife so if you're
noticing<00:04:46.330> problems<00:04:46.600> with<00:04:46.900> your<00:04:47.020> knife<00:04:47.200> like<00:04:48.010> a

00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:48.040 
noticing problems with your knife like a

00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:50.700 
noticing problems with your knife like a
lot<00:04:48.250> of<00:04:48.370> chipping<00:04:48.760> or<00:04:49.000> deformation<00:04:49.720> or<00:04:49.990> loss

00:04:50.700 --> 00:04:50.710 
lot of chipping or deformation or loss

00:04:50.710 --> 00:04:52.020 
lot of chipping or deformation or loss
of<00:04:50.860> edge<00:04:50.980> retention<00:04:51.130> relatively<00:04:51.820> quickly

00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:52.030 
of edge retention relatively quickly

00:04:52.030 --> 00:04:54.000 
of edge retention relatively quickly
after<00:04:52.390> sharpening<00:04:52.810> this<00:04:53.290> is<00:04:53.440> a<00:04:53.500> test<00:04:53.740> you<00:04:53.830> can

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:54.010 
after sharpening this is a test you can

00:04:54.010 --> 00:04:56.460 
after sharpening this is a test you can
do<00:04:54.160> and<00:04:54.340> see<00:04:54.610> where<00:04:55.000> you<00:04:55.120> stand<00:04:55.480> and<00:04:55.810> then<00:04:56.230> make

00:04:56.460 --> 00:04:56.470 
do and see where you stand and then make

00:04:56.470 --> 00:04:58.650 
do and see where you stand and then make
adjustments<00:04:57.070> it<00:04:57.190> may<00:04:57.340> mean<00:04:57.580> doing<00:04:58.390> a<00:04:58.510> better

00:04:58.650 --> 00:04:58.660 
adjustments it may mean doing a better

00:04:58.660 --> 00:05:00.510 
adjustments it may mean doing a better
job<00:04:58.990> of<00:04:59.020> removing<00:04:59.380> Birds<00:04:59.770> it<00:04:59.980> may<00:05:00.250> mean

00:05:00.510 --> 00:05:00.520 
job of removing Birds it may mean

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:02.010 
job of removing Birds it may mean
thickening<00:05:01.060> up<00:05:01.210> your<00:05:01.360> edge<00:05:01.480> a<00:05:01.510> little<00:05:01.720> bit<00:05:01.870> or

00:05:02.010 --> 00:05:02.020 
thickening up your edge a little bit or

00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:03.540 
thickening up your edge a little bit or
using<00:05:02.320> a<00:05:02.380> micro<00:05:02.710> bevel<00:05:02.860> to<00:05:03.100> remove<00:05:03.370> the

00:05:03.540 --> 00:05:03.550 
using a micro bevel to remove the

00:05:03.550 --> 00:05:06.930 
using a micro bevel to remove the
weakest<00:05:03.910> part<00:05:04.150> of<00:05:04.210> the<00:05:04.330> edge<00:05:04.950> so<00:05:05.950> it's<00:05:06.700> just

00:05:06.930 --> 00:05:06.940 
weakest part of the edge so it's just

00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:08.580 
weakest part of the edge so it's just
another<00:05:07.390> way<00:05:07.570> that<00:05:07.600> you<00:05:07.870> can<00:05:08.020> see<00:05:08.290> what's

00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:08.590 
another way that you can see what's

00:05:08.590 --> 00:05:09.540 
another way that you can see what's
going<00:05:08.680> on<00:05:09.010> with<00:05:09.160> your<00:05:09.280> knife

00:05:09.540 --> 00:05:09.550 
going on with your knife

00:05:09.550 --> 00:05:11.520 
going on with your knife
after<00:05:09.880> you're<00:05:10.030> done<00:05:10.060> sharpening<00:05:10.660> so<00:05:11.290> you<00:05:11.380> can

00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:11.530 
after you're done sharpening so you can

00:05:11.530 --> 00:05:14.640 
after you're done sharpening so you can
test<00:05:11.740> here<00:05:12.130> for<00:05:12.880> bite<00:05:13.150> how<00:05:13.870> it<00:05:13.990> digs<00:05:14.230> in<00:05:14.470> and

00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:14.650 
test here for bite how it digs in and

00:05:14.650 --> 00:05:18.630 
test here for bite how it digs in and
you<00:05:15.190> can<00:05:15.340> test<00:05:15.580> here<00:05:16.000> for<00:05:16.840> flex<00:05:17.170> and<00:05:17.640> again

00:05:18.630 --> 00:05:18.640 
you can test here for flex and again

00:05:18.640 --> 00:05:20.040 
you can test here for flex and again
what<00:05:18.820> I'm<00:05:18.910> doing<00:05:19.180> is<00:05:19.300> I'm<00:05:19.450> taking<00:05:19.810> the<00:05:19.900> edge

00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:20.050 
what I'm doing is I'm taking the edge

00:05:20.050 --> 00:05:22.830 
what I'm doing is I'm taking the edge
and<00:05:20.350> I'm<00:05:20.800> flexing<00:05:21.340> it<00:05:21.490> under<00:05:21.760> on<00:05:21.910> my<00:05:22.330> thumb<00:05:22.570> and

00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:22.840 
and I'm flexing it under on my thumb and

00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:24.810 
and I'm flexing it under on my thumb and
then<00:05:23.260> I'm<00:05:23.410> rocking<00:05:23.830> my<00:05:23.860> thumb<00:05:24.220> underneath<00:05:24.520> it

00:05:24.810 --> 00:05:24.820 
then I'm rocking my thumb underneath it

00:05:24.820 --> 00:05:27.210 
then I'm rocking my thumb underneath it
to<00:05:25.030> see<00:05:25.240> how<00:05:25.900> much<00:05:26.110> flex<00:05:26.440> I<00:05:26.680> get<00:05:26.830> in<00:05:26.950> the<00:05:27.070> edge

00:05:27.210 --> 00:05:27.220 
to see how much flex I get in the edge

00:05:27.220 --> 00:05:29.910 
to see how much flex I get in the edge
so<00:05:28.090> I<00:05:28.420> hope<00:05:29.050> that<00:05:29.230> these<00:05:29.350> are<00:05:29.410> very<00:05:29.740> helpful

00:05:29.910 --> 00:05:29.920 
so I hope that these are very helpful

00:05:29.920 --> 00:05:31.410 
so I hope that these are very helpful
tests<00:05:30.280> for<00:05:30.520> you<00:05:30.580> and<00:05:30.790> I<00:05:30.850> hope<00:05:31.000> that<00:05:31.180> this<00:05:31.270> is

00:05:31.410 --> 00:05:31.420 
tests for you and I hope that this is

00:05:31.420 --> 00:05:32.940 
tests for you and I hope that this is
something<00:05:31.630> that<00:05:31.900> gives<00:05:32.110> you<00:05:32.200> a<00:05:32.320> little<00:05:32.830> bit

00:05:32.940 --> 00:05:32.950 
something that gives you a little bit

00:05:32.950 --> 00:05:34.200 
something that gives you a little bit
better<00:05:33.040> results<00:05:33.520> in<00:05:33.580> your<00:05:33.640> sharpening<00:05:34.030> or<00:05:34.120> at
