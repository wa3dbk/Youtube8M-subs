00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:35.580 
and it was a screamer let me tell you I

00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:42.619 
and it was a screamer let me tell you I
thought<00:00:36.090> was<00:00:36.210> going<00:00:36.300> to<00:00:36.360> be<00:00:36.420> big<00:00:36.690> silver<00:00:41.629> there

00:00:42.619 --> 00:00:42.629 
thought was going to be big silver there

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:44.360 
thought was going to be big silver there
was<00:00:42.750> a<00:00:42.780> lot<00:00:42.989> of<00:00:43.050> iron<00:00:43.530> in<00:00:43.769> the<00:00:43.920> hole<00:00:44.100> too

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
was a lot of iron in the hole too

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:46.100 
was a lot of iron in the hole too
because<00:00:44.699> I<00:00:44.790> was<00:00:44.970> getting<00:00:45.269> a<00:00:45.360> mixture<00:00:45.960> of

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.110 
because I was getting a mixture of

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:49.280 
because I was getting a mixture of
nulling<00:00:46.739> and<00:00:47.150> so<00:00:48.150> it<00:00:48.299> almost<00:00:48.750> sounded<00:00:49.229> like

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:49.290 
nulling and so it almost sounded like

00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:52.670 
nulling and so it almost sounded like
you<00:00:49.440> know<00:00:49.650> how<00:00:49.799> iron<00:00:50.129> will<00:00:50.430> false<00:00:50.900> but<00:00:51.900> so

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
you know how iron will false but so

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:57.259

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:09.220 
here about 20 minutes I just had a very
choppy<00:04:06.920> signal<00:04:07.670> I<00:04:08.030> would<00:04:08.690> have<00:04:08.810> guessed<00:04:08.990> a

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:09.230 
choppy signal I would have guessed a

00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:12.480 
choppy signal I would have guessed a
penny<00:04:09.560> at<00:04:09.770> best<00:04:10.150> and<00:04:11.150> it's<00:04:11.360> a<00:04:11.480> silver<00:04:11.870> dime

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:12.490 
penny at best and it's a silver dime

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:25.720 
be on the board with some silver like I
said<00:04:24.440> I've<00:04:24.560> been<00:04:24.590> here<00:04:24.830> about<00:04:24.919> 20<00:04:25.190> minutes<00:04:25.490> and

said I've been here about 20 minutes and

00:04:25.730 --> 00:04:28.750 
said I've been here about 20 minutes and
found<00:04:26.419> a<00:04:26.540> bit<00:04:26.690> of<00:04:26.810> clad<00:04:27.020> in<00:04:27.050> one<00:04:27.410> we<00:04:27.650> D<00:04:27.710> and<00:04:28.040> this

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:28.760 
found a bit of clad in one we D and this

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:31.330 
found a bit of clad in one we D and this
was<00:04:28.970> a<00:04:29.000> very<00:04:29.210> choppy<00:04:29.600> signal<00:04:30.260> that<00:04:30.800> came<00:04:31.070> in<00:04:31.220> at

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:31.340 
was a very choppy signal that came in at

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:34.900 
was a very choppy signal that came in at
like<00:04:31.490> 10<00:04:32.210> 38<00:04:32.930> so<00:04:33.740> I<00:04:33.770> wouldn't<00:04:34.520> think<00:04:34.610> of<00:04:34.730> that

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:34.910 
like 10 38 so I wouldn't think of that

00:04:34.910 --> 00:04:36.490 
like 10 38 so I wouldn't think of that
as<00:04:35.060> being<00:04:35.090> a<00:04:35.390> silver<00:04:35.810> but<00:04:35.990> it<00:04:36.080> had<00:04:36.200> a<00:04:36.230> high

00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:36.500 
as being a silver but it had a high

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:39.010 
as being a silver but it had a high
pitch<00:04:36.800> so<00:04:37.520> I'm<00:04:37.730> definitely<00:04:37.940> glad<00:04:38.270> I<00:04:38.390> dug<00:04:38.720> it<00:04:38.750> on

00:04:39.010 --> 00:04:39.020 
pitch so I'm definitely glad I dug it on

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:41.920 
pitch so I'm definitely glad I dug it on
to<00:04:39.350> the<00:04:39.440> next
