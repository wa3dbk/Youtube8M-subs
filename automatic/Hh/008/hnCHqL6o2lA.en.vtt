00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:47.400 
opponent it has a chance to set that

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:50.570 
opponent it has a chance to set that
opponent<00:02:47.850> on<00:02:47.940> fire<00:02:48.770> now<00:02:49.770> like<00:02:50.100> I<00:02:50.190> say<00:02:50.340> this<00:02:50.520> is

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:50.580 
opponent on fire now like I say this is

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:52.640 
opponent on fire now like I say this is
not<00:02:50.760> a<00:02:50.910> one<00:02:51.270> hundred<00:02:51.570> percent<00:02:51.600> guarantee<00:02:52.470> that

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:52.650 
not a one hundred percent guarantee that

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:53.720 
not a one hundred percent guarantee that
you're<00:02:52.739> going<00:02:52.830> to<00:02:52.890> set<00:02:53.100> them<00:02:53.250> on<00:02:53.340> fire<00:02:53.519> with

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:53.730 
you're going to set them on fire with

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:56.479 
you're going to set them on fire with
every<00:02:54.000> shot<00:02:54.030> it's<00:02:54.480> just<00:02:54.959> a<00:02:55.140> chance<00:02:55.530> but<00:02:55.920> the

00:02:56.479 --> 00:02:56.489 
every shot it's just a chance but the

00:02:56.489 --> 00:02:58.100 
every shot it's just a chance but the
chance<00:02:56.700> on<00:02:56.820> setting<00:02:57.060> them<00:02:57.180> on<00:02:57.239> fire<00:02:57.300> shooting

00:02:58.100 --> 00:02:58.110 
chance on setting them on fire shooting

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:00.110 
chance on setting them on fire shooting
through<00:02:58.350> the<00:02:58.380> firewall<00:02:58.830> is<00:02:59.120> significantly

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:00.120 
through the firewall is significantly

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:02.840 
through the firewall is significantly
greater<00:03:00.180> than<00:03:00.810> shooting<00:03:01.140> them<00:03:01.550> without<00:03:02.550> a

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:02.850 
greater than shooting them without a

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:05.350 
greater than shooting them without a
firewall<00:03:03.540> and<00:03:03.780> having<00:03:04.170> them<00:03:04.260> catch<00:03:04.470> on<00:03:04.650> fire

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:05.360 
firewall and having them catch on fire

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:08.060 
firewall and having them catch on fire
kind<00:03:06.360> of<00:03:06.390> won't<00:03:06.540> happen<00:03:06.690> at<00:03:06.930> all<00:03:07.050> actually<00:03:07.290> so

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:08.070 
kind of won't happen at all actually so

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:11.180 
kind of won't happen at all actually so
our<00:03:08.220> thief<00:03:08.430> is<00:03:08.610> now<00:03:08.820> officially<00:03:09.390> on<00:03:09.570> fire<00:03:10.190> it's

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:11.190 
our thief is now officially on fire it's

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:13.880 
our thief is now officially on fire it's
a<00:03:11.400> dot<00:03:11.910> so<00:03:12.300> it'll<00:03:12.510> burn<00:03:12.720> over<00:03:13.019> time<00:03:13.260> and<00:03:13.620> it

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:13.890 
a dot so it'll burn over time and it

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:17.570 
a dot so it'll burn over time and it
will<00:03:14.130> eventually<00:03:14.790> kill<00:03:15.330> them<00:03:15.540> dead<00:03:16.580> alright

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:17.580 
will eventually kill them dead alright

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:20.420 
will eventually kill them dead alright
this<00:03:18.180> combo<00:03:18.930> is<00:03:19.140> very<00:03:19.410> basic<00:03:20.010> but<00:03:20.040> there<00:03:20.310> are

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:20.430 
this combo is very basic but there are

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:23.270 
this combo is very basic but there are
some<00:03:20.760> that<00:03:20.910> are<00:03:20.970> quite<00:03:21.480> complex<00:03:22.100> let's<00:03:23.100> go

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:23.280 
some that are quite complex let's go

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:24.949 
some that are quite complex let's go
into<00:03:23.489> them<00:03:23.730> in<00:03:23.910> detail<00:03:24.060> right<00:03:24.450> now<00:03:24.630> and<00:03:24.840> I'll

00:03:24.949 --> 00:03:24.959 
into them in detail right now and I'll

00:03:24.959 --> 00:03:27.229 
into them in detail right now and I'll
talk<00:03:25.140> a<00:03:25.200> little<00:03:25.410> bit<00:03:25.560> about<00:03:25.739> them<00:03:26.010> as<00:03:26.970> you<00:03:27.150> can

00:03:27.229 --> 00:03:27.239 
talk a little bit about them as you can

00:03:27.239 --> 00:03:29.390 
talk a little bit about them as you can
see<00:03:27.480> by<00:03:27.630> this<00:03:27.690> chart<00:03:28.079> it's<00:03:28.320> quite<00:03:28.799> complicated

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:29.400 
see by this chart it's quite complicated

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:31.940 
see by this chart it's quite complicated
first<00:03:30.360> off<00:03:30.600> you<00:03:30.780> have<00:03:30.810> the<00:03:31.170> field<00:03:31.530> it's<00:03:31.799> either

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:31.950 
first off you have the field it's either

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:35.420 
first off you have the field it's either
dark<00:03:32.310> ethereal<00:03:32.910> firelight<00:03:33.750> ice<00:03:34.739> lightning

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:35.430 
dark ethereal firelight ice lightning

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:38.210 
dark ethereal firelight ice lightning
poison<00:03:36.239> smoke<00:03:36.690> or<00:03:36.930> water<00:03:37.410> those<00:03:38.010> are<00:03:38.190> the

00:03:38.210 --> 00:03:38.220 
poison smoke or water those are the

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:41.000 
poison smoke or water those are the
fields<00:03:38.730> and<00:03:38.910> then<00:03:39.900> they<00:03:40.049> have<00:03:40.230> the<00:03:40.410> finishers

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:41.010 
fields and then they have the finishers

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:45.729 
fields and then they have the finishers
so<00:03:42.049> the<00:03:43.049> finisher<00:03:43.440> for<00:03:43.470> like<00:03:43.950> fire<00:03:44.670> and

00:03:45.729 --> 00:03:45.739 
so the finisher for like fire and

00:03:45.739 --> 00:03:48.170 
so the finisher for like fire and
projectile<00:03:46.739> is<00:03:46.980> a<00:03:47.010> terms<00:03:47.310> of<00:03:47.489> projectile<00:03:47.910> into

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:48.180 
projectile is a terms of projectile into

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:49.970 
projectile is a terms of projectile into
a<00:03:48.209> burning<00:03:48.600> finisher<00:03:49.440> you<00:03:49.530> see<00:03:49.680> what<00:03:49.799> I<00:03:49.860> mean

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:49.980 
a burning finisher you see what I mean

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:52.220 
a burning finisher you see what I mean
and<00:03:50.190> you<00:03:50.670> have<00:03:50.790> the<00:03:50.910> initiator<00:03:51.360> being<00:03:51.720> the

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:52.230 
and you have the initiator being the

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:53.810 
and you have the initiator being the
like<00:03:52.590> the<00:03:52.739> Asura<00:03:53.010> in<00:03:53.220> this<00:03:53.400> case<00:03:53.640> is<00:03:53.790> the

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:53.820 
like the Asura in this case is the

00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:59.000 
like the Asura in this case is the

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:00.120 
in this scenario that we did in the

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:02.360 
in this scenario that we did in the
background<00:04:00.540> here<00:04:00.750> now<00:04:01.560> these<00:04:01.709> skills<00:04:02.160> and

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:02.370 
background here now these skills and

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:04.039 
background here now these skills and
traits<00:04:02.610> are<00:04:02.850> unlocked<00:04:03.299> through<00:04:03.540> different

00:04:04.039 --> 00:04:04.049 
traits are unlocked through different

00:04:04.049 --> 00:04:05.630

professions<00:04:04.560> dark<00:04:04.920> you<00:04:05.070> would<00:04:05.190> automatically

00:04:05.630 --> 00:04:05.640 
professions dark you would automatically

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:07.370 
professions dark you would automatically
think<00:04:05.940> well<00:04:06.090> that's<00:04:06.209> all<00:04:06.420> necro<00:04:06.810> but<00:04:06.959> actually

00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:07.380 
think well that's all necro but actually

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:10.789 
think well that's all necro but actually
there<00:04:07.560> is<00:04:07.739> one<00:04:07.910> from<00:04:08.910> a<00:04:09.150> thief<00:04:09.450> so<00:04:10.320> the<00:04:10.500> thief

00:04:10.789 --> 00:04:10.799 
there is one from a thief so the thief

dark<00:04:11.310> skill<00:04:11.730> is<00:04:11.880> called<00:04:12.120> shadow<00:04:12.590> refuge<00:04:13.590> so

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:14.400 
dark skill is called shadow refuge so

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:17.509 
dark skill is called shadow refuge so
the<00:04:14.700> shadow<00:04:15.000> refuge<00:04:15.720> creates<00:04:16.380> a<00:04:16.620> pulsing

00:04:17.509 --> 00:04:17.519 
the shadow refuge creates a pulsing

00:04:17.519 --> 00:04:20.240 
the shadow refuge creates a pulsing
refuge<00:04:18.450> at<00:04:18.600> the<00:04:18.720> target<00:04:19.200> that<00:04:19.410> heals<00:04:19.769> allies
