hey<00:00:01.589> guys<00:00:01.770> in<00:00:01.949> my<00:00:02.670> flood<00:00:02.880> coolant<00:00:03.240> video<00:00:03.450> I

00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:03.510 
hey guys in my flood coolant video I

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:05.570 
hey guys in my flood coolant video I
talked<00:00:03.900> about<00:00:03.990> this<00:00:04.200> really<00:00:04.500> awful<00:00:04.800> sheet

00:00:05.570 --> 00:00:05.580 
talked about this really awful sheet

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:07.160 
talked about this really awful sheet
metal<00:00:05.790> break<00:00:05.970> that<00:00:06.150> I<00:00:06.180> made<00:00:06.420> and<00:00:06.660> I<00:00:06.840> wanted<00:00:07.110> to

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:07.170 
metal break that I made and I wanted to

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:08.960 
metal break that I made and I wanted to
show<00:00:07.319> it<00:00:07.410> to<00:00:07.529> you<00:00:07.650> this<00:00:08.009> is<00:00:08.160> made<00:00:08.339> up<00:00:08.460> of<00:00:08.610> three

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:08.970 
show it to you this is made up of three

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:10.730 
show it to you this is made up of three
boards<00:00:09.390> I<00:00:09.599> happen<00:00:09.960> to<00:00:09.990> have<00:00:10.080> some<00:00:10.260> glued<00:00:10.590> up

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:10.740 
boards I happen to have some glued up

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:12.560 
boards I happen to have some glued up
plywood<00:00:11.280> but<00:00:11.550> you<00:00:11.730> could<00:00:11.880> use<00:00:12.000> two<00:00:12.210> by<00:00:12.330> fours

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:12.570 
plywood but you could use two by fours

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:13.850 
plywood but you could use two by fours
for<00:00:12.840> all<00:00:12.960> three<00:00:13.170> of<00:00:13.230> these<00:00:13.320> boards<00:00:13.650> that<00:00:13.769> would

00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:13.860 
for all three of these boards that would

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:17.240 
for all three of these boards that would
work<00:00:13.980> just<00:00:14.219> fine<00:00:15.199> 2/3<00:00:16.199> inch<00:00:16.349> drywall<00:00:16.650> screws

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:17.250 
work just fine 2/3 inch drywall screws

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:20.630 
work just fine 2/3 inch drywall screws
and<00:00:17.750> two<00:00:18.750> door<00:00:19.230> hinges<00:00:19.590> these<00:00:20.039> literally<00:00:20.490> came

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:20.640 
and two door hinges these literally came

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:22.730 
and two door hinges these literally came
off<00:00:20.760> a<00:00:20.789> door<00:00:21.060> in<00:00:21.150> my<00:00:21.300> house<00:00:21.449> and<00:00:21.720> then<00:00:22.440> I<00:00:22.470> just

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:22.740 
off a door in my house and then I just

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:24.080 
off a door in my house and then I just
clamped<00:00:23.039> the<00:00:23.100> whole<00:00:23.250> thing<00:00:23.430> down<00:00:23.580> to<00:00:23.760> my<00:00:23.880> bench

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:24.090 
clamped the whole thing down to my bench

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:26.090 
clamped the whole thing down to my bench
and<00:00:24.449> it<00:00:24.900> worked<00:00:25.050> great<00:00:25.230> I'm<00:00:25.560> bending<00:00:25.890> some

00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:26.100 
and it worked great I'm bending some

00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:28.519 
and it worked great I'm bending some
really<00:00:26.460> thin<00:00:26.789> soft<00:00:27.630> aluminum<00:00:28.199> I<00:00:28.260> think<00:00:28.439> this

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:28.529 
really thin soft aluminum I think this

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:30.980 
really thin soft aluminum I think this
is<00:00:28.650> 5000<00:00:29.279> series<00:00:29.550> aluminum<00:00:29.939> and<00:00:30.060> it's<00:00:30.150> 30<00:00:30.390> mm

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:30.990 
is 5000 series aluminum and it's 30 mm

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:33.379 
is 5000 series aluminum and it's 30 mm
thick<00:00:31.230> this<00:00:31.769> thing<00:00:32.039> is<00:00:32.219> not<00:00:32.489> very<00:00:32.789> strong<00:00:33.120> so

00:00:33.379 --> 00:00:33.389 
thick this thing is not very strong so

00:00:33.389 --> 00:00:35.389 
thick this thing is not very strong so
I'm<00:00:33.539> not<00:00:33.929> sure<00:00:33.989> I<00:00:34.679> would<00:00:34.979> be<00:00:35.100> able<00:00:35.159> to<00:00:35.280> do

00:00:35.389 --> 00:00:35.399 
I'm not sure I would be able to do

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:37.790 
I'm not sure I would be able to do
ducting<00:00:35.789> tin<00:00:36.030> I<00:00:36.179> didn't<00:00:36.389> actually<00:00:36.510> try<00:00:36.929> it<00:00:36.960> but

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:37.800 
ducting tin I didn't actually try it but

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:38.930 
ducting tin I didn't actually try it but
I<00:00:38.010> mean<00:00:38.190> if<00:00:38.280> you<00:00:38.370> put<00:00:38.399> a<00:00:38.519> little<00:00:38.670> thought<00:00:38.879> into

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:38.940 
I mean if you put a little thought into

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:40.250 
I mean if you put a little thought into
it<00:00:39.149> you<00:00:39.329> could<00:00:39.510> come<00:00:39.600> up<00:00:39.690> with<00:00:39.719> something<00:00:39.989> 10

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:40.260 
it you could come up with something 10

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:42.049 
it you could come up with something 10
times<00:00:40.289> better<00:00:40.679> but<00:00:41.370> I<00:00:41.489> wanted<00:00:41.879> to<00:00:41.940> do

00:00:42.049 --> 00:00:42.059 
times better but I wanted to do

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:43.729 
times better but I wanted to do
something<00:00:42.389> fast<00:00:42.690> and<00:00:42.899> simple<00:00:43.260> so<00:00:43.409> I<00:00:43.469> could

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:43.739 
something fast and simple so I could

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:46.219 
something fast and simple so I could
make<00:00:43.979> my<00:00:44.010> stepper<00:00:44.579> covers<00:00:44.969> that<00:00:45.959> way<00:00:46.109> they

00:00:46.219 --> 00:00:46.229 
make my stepper covers that way they

00:00:46.229 --> 00:00:47.569 
make my stepper covers that way they
wouldn't<00:00:46.469> get<00:00:46.649> you<00:00:46.799> know<00:00:46.920> my<00:00:47.249> steppers

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579 
wouldn't get you know my steppers

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:48.979 
wouldn't get you know my steppers
wouldn't<00:00:47.850> get<00:00:47.969> soaked<00:00:48.209> by<00:00:48.299> the<00:00:48.389> flood<00:00:48.659> coolant

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
wouldn't get soaked by the flood coolant

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:52.039 
wouldn't get soaked by the flood coolant
but<00:00:49.679> yeah<00:00:50.609> look<00:00:50.879> at<00:00:50.969> that<00:00:51.059> I<00:00:51.089> mean<00:00:51.299> almost<00:00:51.510> 90

00:00:52.039 --> 00:00:52.049 
but yeah look at that I mean almost 90

00:00:52.049 --> 00:00:53.599 
but yeah look at that I mean almost 90
degrees<00:00:52.079> I<00:00:52.409> had<00:00:52.619> to<00:00:52.709> finish<00:00:52.920> the<00:00:53.039> bend<00:00:53.219> by<00:00:53.399> hand

00:00:53.599 --> 00:00:53.609 
degrees I had to finish the bend by hand

00:00:53.609 --> 00:00:55.160 
degrees I had to finish the bend by hand
a<00:00:53.699> little<00:00:53.850> bit<00:00:54.030> but<00:00:54.299> it<00:00:54.510> worked<00:00:54.719> really<00:00:54.899> fine

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170 
a little bit but it worked really fine

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:56.869 
a little bit but it worked really fine
if<00:00:55.799> you<00:00:55.920> take<00:00:56.039> a<00:00:56.069> look<00:00:56.219> at<00:00:56.339> the<00:00:56.429> hinges<00:00:56.549> you'll

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 
if you take a look at the hinges you'll

00:00:56.879 --> 00:00:58.879 
if you take a look at the hinges you'll
notice<00:00:57.149> that<00:00:57.269> the<00:00:57.389> pin<00:00:57.600> or<00:00:57.839> barrel<00:00:58.409> is<00:00:58.619> lined

00:00:58.879 --> 00:00:58.889 
notice that the pin or barrel is lined

00:00:58.889 --> 00:01:00.469 
notice that the pin or barrel is lined
up<00:00:59.039> right<00:00:59.279> on<00:00:59.429> the<00:00:59.549> edge<00:00:59.639> of<00:00:59.760> the<00:00:59.879> fixed<00:01:00.209> part

00:01:00.469 --> 00:01:00.479 
up right on the edge of the fixed part

00:01:00.479 --> 00:01:03.619 
up right on the edge of the fixed part
of<00:01:00.719> the<00:01:01.249> of<00:01:02.249> the<00:01:02.429> break<00:01:02.670> and<00:01:02.879> the<00:01:03.239> reason<00:01:03.479> for

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629 
of the of the break and the reason for

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:05.270 
of the of the break and the reason for
that<00:01:03.690> is<00:01:03.869> when<00:01:04.019> you<00:01:04.140> fold<00:01:04.500> up<00:01:04.680> the<00:01:04.829> other<00:01:04.979> part

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280 
that is when you fold up the other part

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:06.770 
that is when you fold up the other part
it's<00:01:05.640> going<00:01:05.850> to<00:01:05.909> create<00:01:06.119> a<00:01:06.180> gap<00:01:06.450> and<00:01:06.719> that's

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:06.780 
it's going to create a gap and that's

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:08.899 
it's going to create a gap and that's
just<00:01:07.049> because<00:01:07.229> of<00:01:07.649> the<00:01:07.890> the<00:01:08.399> way<00:01:08.579> that<00:01:08.820> the

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909 
just because of the the way that the

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:11.179 
just because of the the way that the
hinge<00:01:09.090> works<00:01:09.390> this<00:01:09.960> type<00:01:10.200> of<00:01:10.320> hinge<00:01:10.469> and<00:01:10.710> you

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:11.189 
hinge works this type of hinge and you

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:12.830 
hinge works this type of hinge and you
want<00:01:11.369> that<00:01:11.460> gap<00:01:11.700> to<00:01:11.729> be<00:01:12.000> in<00:01:12.119> the<00:01:12.270> in<00:01:12.509> the

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
want that gap to be in the in the

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:14.630 
want that gap to be in the in the
vertical<00:01:13.350> plane<00:01:13.530> that's<00:01:14.189> why<00:01:14.369> you<00:01:14.430> need<00:01:14.609> to

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
vertical plane that's why you need to

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:17.330 
vertical plane that's why you need to
line<00:01:14.880> those<00:01:15.119> that<00:01:16.079> barrel<00:01:16.500> or<00:01:16.740> the<00:01:16.770> hinge<00:01:17.070> pin

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
line those that barrel or the hinge pin

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:18.969 
line those that barrel or the hinge pin
up<00:01:17.520> the<00:01:17.700> way<00:01:17.850> you<00:01:17.909> saw<00:01:18.240> in<00:01:18.359> that<00:01:18.390> last<00:01:18.600> clip

00:01:18.969 --> 00:01:18.979 
up the way you saw in that last clip

00:01:18.979 --> 00:01:20.959 
up the way you saw in that last clip
anyway<00:01:19.979> let<00:01:20.130> me<00:01:20.159> show<00:01:20.219> you<00:01:20.399> one<00:01:20.579> other<00:01:20.670> shot

00:01:20.959 --> 00:01:20.969 
anyway let me show you one other shot

00:01:20.969 --> 00:01:22.910 
anyway let me show you one other shot
this<00:01:21.359> is<00:01:21.539> me<00:01:21.750> actually<00:01:21.899> bending<00:01:22.530> up<00:01:22.649> one<00:01:22.799> of<00:01:22.890> my

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
this is me actually bending up one of my

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:26.060 
this is me actually bending up one of my
stepper<00:01:23.219> covers<00:01:23.579> and<00:01:24.530> I've<00:01:25.530> already<00:01:25.710> laid<00:01:26.039> out

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.070 
stepper covers and I've already laid out

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:27.859 
stepper covers and I've already laid out
the<00:01:26.369> aluminum<00:01:26.820> exactly<00:01:27.240> how<00:01:27.329> I<00:01:27.359> want<00:01:27.659> to<00:01:27.719> bend

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:27.869 
the aluminum exactly how I want to bend

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:30.080 
the aluminum exactly how I want to bend
it<00:01:28.020> so<00:01:28.259> all<00:01:28.679> I<00:01:28.740> have<00:01:28.890> to<00:01:29.009> do<00:01:29.130> is<00:01:29.340> screw<00:01:29.999> this

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
it so all I have to do is screw this

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:31.340 
it so all I have to do is screw this
down<00:01:30.270> a<00:01:30.329> little<00:01:30.570> bit<00:01:30.719> since<00:01:30.990> it's<00:01:31.140> been

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
down a little bit since it's been

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:32.899 
down a little bit since it's been
screwed<00:01:31.619> down<00:01:31.740> before<00:01:32.100> I<00:01:32.130> can<00:01:32.219> easily<00:01:32.609> line<00:01:32.759> it

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:32.909 
screwed down before I can easily line it

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:34.760 
screwed down before I can easily line it
up<00:01:32.969> with<00:01:33.119> the<00:01:33.240> holes<00:01:33.450> from<00:01:34.200> the<00:01:34.289> first<00:01:34.560> time

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770 
up with the holes from the first time

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:37.039 
up with the holes from the first time
slip<00:01:35.670> in<00:01:35.789> the<00:01:35.880> metal<00:01:36.149> and<00:01:36.179> then<00:01:36.659> do<00:01:36.810> a<00:01:36.840> couple

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:37.049 
slip in the metal and then do a couple

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:39.440 
slip in the metal and then do a couple
of<00:01:37.289> bends<00:01:37.679> and<00:01:37.829> it<00:01:38.100> comes<00:01:38.280> out<00:01:38.490> looking<00:01:39.329> pretty

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
of bends and it comes out looking pretty

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:41.239 
of bends and it comes out looking pretty
good<00:01:39.719> I<00:01:39.960> do<00:01:40.200> have<00:01:40.499> to<00:01:40.590> finish<00:01:40.740> the<00:01:40.920> bends<00:01:41.100> by

00:01:41.239 --> 00:01:41.249 
good I do have to finish the bends by

00:01:41.249 --> 00:01:43.279 
good I do have to finish the bends by
hand<00:01:41.490> again<00:01:41.759> and<00:01:41.909> that's<00:01:42.030> because<00:01:42.390> the<00:01:42.719> the

00:01:43.279 --> 00:01:43.289 
hand again and that's because the the

00:01:43.289 --> 00:01:44.899 
hand again and that's because the the
metals<00:01:43.560> got<00:01:43.649> some<00:01:43.829> springiness<00:01:44.340> to<00:01:44.490> it<00:01:44.640> and

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:44.909 
metals got some springiness to it and

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:46.249 
metals got some springiness to it and
all<00:01:45.119> metal<00:01:45.299> is<00:01:45.479> like<00:01:45.659> that<00:01:45.840> you're<00:01:45.990> not<00:01:46.020> going

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:46.259 
all metal is like that you're not going

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:48.319 
all metal is like that you're not going
to<00:01:46.319> get<00:01:46.469> perfect<00:01:46.649> 90-degree<00:01:47.340> bends<00:01:47.700> unless

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:48.329 
to get perfect 90-degree bends unless

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:51.410 
to get perfect 90-degree bends unless
you're<00:01:48.600> able<00:01:48.780> to<00:01:49.109> force<00:01:49.890> the<00:01:50.189> break<00:01:50.369> past<00:01:50.850> 90

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:51.420 
you're able to force the break past 90

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:53.359 
you're able to force the break past 90
degrees<00:01:51.719> which<00:01:52.020> I<00:01:52.229> can't<00:01:52.469> do<00:01:52.619> because<00:01:52.649> it's

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:53.369 
degrees which I can't do because it's

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:55.880 
degrees which I can't do because it's
running<00:01:53.700> up<00:01:53.850> against<00:01:54.060> 2x4<00:01:54.590> anyway<00:01:55.590> in<00:01:55.799> the

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:55.890 
running up against 2x4 anyway in the

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:56.989 
running up against 2x4 anyway in the
next<00:01:55.920> shot<00:01:56.249> I'll<00:01:56.490> show<00:01:56.639> you<00:01:56.700> how<00:01:56.850> they<00:01:56.969> look

00:01:56.989 --> 00:01:56.999 
next shot I'll show you how they look

00:01:56.999 --> 00:01:58.459 
next shot I'll show you how they look
down<00:01:57.299> the<00:01:57.420> middle<00:01:57.600> in<00:01:57.840> case<00:01:58.020> you<00:01:58.139> forgotten

00:01:58.459 --> 00:01:58.469 
down the middle in case you forgotten

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:00.649 
down the middle in case you forgotten
and<00:01:58.759> that's<00:01:59.759> everything<00:02:00.240> I<00:02:00.299> wanted<00:02:00.509> to<00:02:00.569> show
