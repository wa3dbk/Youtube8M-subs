00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:01.250 
basically just a rectangle on the ground

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:05.050 
basically just a rectangle on the ground
I'm<00:04:02.480> going<00:04:03.480> to<00:04:03.600> have<00:04:03.690> to<00:04:03.750> put<00:04:03.959> a<00:04:03.990> top<00:04:04.260> on<00:04:04.530> it

I'm going to have to put a top on it
level<00:04:06.060> it<00:04:06.150> up<00:04:06.270> a<00:04:06.420> little<00:04:06.569> bit<00:04:07.220> but<00:04:08.780> pretty<00:04:09.780> much

00:04:09.979 --> 00:04:09.989

that's what I've got so far it's pretty

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:18.470 
that's what I've got so far it's pretty
simple<00:04:14.750> you<00:04:15.750> can<00:04:15.930> take<00:04:16.139> it<00:04:16.290> if<00:04:16.440> it's<00:04:16.650> not<00:04:17.480> not

00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:18.480 
simple you can take it if it's not not

00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:20.930 
simple you can take it if it's not not
perfectly<00:04:19.010> square<00:04:20.010> but<00:04:20.310> that<00:04:20.459> doesn't<00:04:20.820> matter

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:20.940 
perfectly square but that doesn't matter

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:22.440 
perfectly square but that doesn't matter
long<00:04:21.389> as<00:04:21.540> it

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:22.450 
long as it

00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:26.910

00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:54.450 
quail so you'll notice on the inside I

00:04:54.450 --> 00:04:58.290 
quail so you'll notice on the inside I
haven't<00:04:55.450> got<00:04:55.630> much<00:04:55.870> in<00:04:56.410> the<00:04:57.220> way<00:04:57.250> of<00:04:57.430> a<00:04:57.730> step<00:04:58.060> up

00:04:58.290 --> 00:04:58.300 
haven't got much in the way of a step up

00:04:58.300 --> 00:05:02.190 
haven't got much in the way of a step up
once<00:04:58.870> the<00:04:58.990> quail<00:04:59.230> puts<00:04:59.530> his<00:04:59.680> head<00:04:59.890> down<00:05:01.200> I'm

00:05:02.190 --> 00:05:02.200 
once the quail puts his head down I'm

00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:06.530 
once the quail puts his head down I'm
going<00:05:02.350> to<00:05:02.440> put<00:05:03.960> grass<00:05:04.960> seat<00:05:05.260> out<00:05:05.740> here<00:05:05.800> and

00:05:08.850 --> 00:05:08.860 
lure them in I'll put a little bit of

00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:10.320 
lure them in I'll put a little bit of
grass<00:05:09.070> seed<00:05:09.340> here<00:05:09.580> a<00:05:09.610> little<00:05:09.820> more<00:05:10.090> in<00:05:10.300> the

00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:10.330 
grass seed here a little more in the

00:05:10.330 --> 00:05:12.840 
grass seed here a little more in the
tunnel<00:05:10.750> and<00:05:11.220> quite<00:05:12.220> a<00:05:12.250> bit<00:05:12.460> more<00:05:12.640> on<00:05:12.790> the

00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:12.850 
tunnel and quite a bit more on the

00:05:12.850 --> 00:05:15.150 
tunnel and quite a bit more on the
inside<00:05:13.200> and<00:05:14.200> once<00:05:14.410> they<00:05:14.590> find<00:05:14.890> their<00:05:15.040> way

00:05:15.150 --> 00:05:15.160 
inside and once they find their way

00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:17.310 
inside and once they find their way
inside<00:05:15.400> they<00:05:16.390> can't<00:05:16.690> find<00:05:16.960> their<00:05:17.050> way<00:05:17.290> out

00:05:17.310 --> 00:05:17.320 
inside they can't find their way out

00:05:17.320 --> 00:05:18.720 
inside they can't find their way out
because<00:05:17.800> they<00:05:17.950> won't<00:05:18.100> put<00:05:18.340> their<00:05:18.520> head<00:05:18.700> down

00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:18.730 
because they won't put their head down

00:05:18.730 --> 00:05:22.950 
because they won't put their head down
below<00:05:19.630> ground<00:05:19.960> level<00:05:20.110> to<00:05:20.980> get<00:05:21.160> out<00:05:21.310> so<00:05:22.060> they're

00:05:22.950 --> 00:05:22.960 
below ground level to get out so they're

00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:26.570 
below ground level to get out so they're
pretty<00:05:23.500> much<00:05:23.560> trapped<00:05:23.980> in<00:05:24.190> there<00:05:24.540> but<00:05:25.560> anyway

00:05:26.570 --> 00:05:26.580 
pretty much trapped in there but anyway

00:05:26.580 --> 00:05:31.260 
pretty much trapped in there but anyway
that's<00:05:27.580> how<00:05:28.120> quail<00:05:28.450> trap<00:05:28.780> works<00:05:29.080> i'll<00:05:30.270> go

00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:31.270 
that's how quail trap works i'll go

00:05:31.270 --> 00:05:33.990 
that's how quail trap works i'll go
ahead<00:05:31.300> and<00:05:31.480> put<00:05:31.750> a<00:05:31.780> top<00:05:32.080> on<00:05:32.350> it<00:05:32.550> close<00:05:33.550> it<00:05:33.820> in

00:05:33.990 --> 00:05:34.000 
ahead and put a top on it close it in

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:38.490 
ahead and put a top on it close it in
and<00:05:35.700> get<00:05:36.700> a<00:05:36.730> better<00:05:36.880> understanding<00:05:37.360> of<00:05:38.080> how<00:05:38.320> it

00:05:38.490 --> 00:05:38.500 
and get a better understanding of how it

00:05:38.500 --> 00:05:40.680 
and get a better understanding of how it
works<00:05:38.910> alright<00:05:39.910> guys<00:05:40.090> thanks<00:05:40.510> for<00:05:40.540> watching

I'll be back in a minute
okay<00:05:43.590> this<00:05:43.830> is<00:05:43.980> pretty<00:05:44.220> much<00:05:44.310> time<00:05:44.640> putting

00:05:44.990 --> 00:05:45.000 
okay this is pretty much time putting

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:48.200 
okay this is pretty much time putting
the<00:05:45.060> top<00:05:45.270> on<00:05:46.280> just<00:05:47.280> going<00:05:47.430> to<00:05:47.490> weave<00:05:47.700> those<00:05:47.940> in

00:05:48.200 --> 00:05:48.210 
the top on just going to weave those in

00:05:48.210 --> 00:05:51.950 
the top on just going to weave those in
and<00:05:48.360> out<00:05:48.980> make<00:05:49.980> the<00:05:50.130> gaps<00:05:50.370> approximately<00:05:51.300> two

00:05:51.950 --> 00:05:51.960 
and out make the gaps approximately two

00:05:51.960 --> 00:05:55.280 
and out make the gaps approximately two
inches<00:05:51.990> or<00:05:52.590> so<00:05:52.860> just<00:05:53.600> small<00:05:54.600> enough<00:05:54.750> so<00:05:54.900> the

00:05:55.280 --> 00:05:55.290 
inches or so just small enough so the

00:05:55.290 --> 00:05:58.670 
inches or so just small enough so the
birds<00:05:55.980> can't<00:05:56.370> jump<00:05:56.730> up<00:05:56.910> and<00:05:57.150> get<00:05:57.540> out<00:05:57.750> but

00:05:58.670 --> 00:05:58.680 
birds can't jump up and get out but

00:05:58.680 --> 00:06:03.320 
birds can't jump up and get out but
pretty<00:05:59.640> much<00:05:59.820> that's<00:06:00.090> it<00:06:00.740> like<00:06:01.740> I<00:06:01.890> said<00:06:02.270> as<00:06:03.270> far

00:06:03.320 --> 00:06:03.330 
pretty much that's it like I said as far

00:06:03.330 --> 00:06:08.840 
pretty much that's it like I said as far
as<00:06:03.660> the<00:06:03.780> tunnel<00:06:04.200> coming<00:06:04.740> in<00:06:05.210> you<00:06:06.210> want<00:06:06.450> to<00:06:07.850> dig

00:06:08.840 --> 00:06:08.850 
as the tunnel coming in you want to dig

00:06:08.850 --> 00:06:12.110 
as the tunnel coming in you want to dig
out<00:06:09.000> a<00:06:09.030> place<00:06:09.330> in<00:06:09.540> front<00:06:09.930> of<00:06:10.560> the<00:06:10.890> trip<00:06:11.190> that's

00:06:12.110 --> 00:06:12.120 
out a place in front of the trip that's

00:06:12.120 --> 00:06:15.440 
out a place in front of the trip that's
low<00:06:12.420> enough<00:06:12.720> where<00:06:13.230> the<00:06:13.380> birds<00:06:14.030> can<00:06:15.030> get<00:06:15.210> off

00:06:15.440 --> 00:06:15.450 
low enough where the birds can get off

00:06:15.450 --> 00:06:18.080 
low enough where the birds can get off
can<00:06:16.380> come<00:06:16.590> off<00:06:16.740> a<00:06:16.770> natural<00:06:17.310> ground<00:06:17.490> into<00:06:17.880> there

00:06:18.080 --> 00:06:18.090 
can come off a natural ground into there

00:06:18.090 --> 00:06:20.630 
can come off a natural ground into there
and<00:06:18.300> feed<00:06:19.080> on<00:06:19.470> the<00:06:19.800> seat<00:06:20.040> that<00:06:20.070> you<00:06:20.340> place

00:06:20.630 --> 00:06:20.640 
and feed on the seat that you place

00:06:20.640 --> 00:06:22.730 
and feed on the seat that you place
there<00:06:20.910> now<00:06:21.690> once<00:06:21.870> they<00:06:22.020> follow<00:06:22.320> the<00:06:22.500> seed

00:06:22.730 --> 00:06:22.740 
there now once they follow the seed

00:06:22.740 --> 00:06:25.310 
there now once they follow the seed
trail<00:06:23.010> inside<00:06:23.870> they're<00:06:24.870> not<00:06:25.020> going<00:06:25.140> to<00:06:25.230> be

00:06:25.310 --> 00:06:25.320 
trail inside they're not going to be

00:06:25.320 --> 00:06:26.690 
trail inside they're not going to be
able<00:06:25.350> to<00:06:25.560> get<00:06:25.680> back<00:06:25.920> out<00:06:26.100> because<00:06:26.250> they<00:06:26.580> won't

00:06:26.690 --> 00:06:26.700 
able to get back out because they won't

00:06:26.700 --> 00:06:28.370 
able to get back out because they won't
put<00:06:26.940> their<00:06:27.090> head<00:06:27.240> down<00:06:27.270> below<00:06:27.930> ground<00:06:28.260> level

00:06:28.370 --> 00:06:28.380 
put their head down below ground level

00:06:28.380 --> 00:06:33.050 
put their head down below ground level
so<00:06:29.840> anyway<00:06:30.840> that's<00:06:31.350> pretty<00:06:31.710> much<00:06:31.890> it<00:06:31.950> I'm<00:06:32.790> not

00:06:33.050 --> 00:06:33.060 
so anyway that's pretty much it I'm not

00:06:33.060 --> 00:06:34.280 
so anyway that's pretty much it I'm not
going<00:06:33.270> to<00:06:33.330> go<00:06:33.480> ahead<00:06:33.540> and<00:06:33.720> I'm<00:06:33.870> not<00:06:34.080> going<00:06:34.230> to

00:06:34.280 --> 00:06:34.290 
going to go ahead and I'm not going to

00:06:34.290 --> 00:06:36.500 
going to go ahead and I'm not going to
finish<00:06:34.620> the<00:06:34.800> thing<00:06:35.040> because<00:06:35.820> like<00:06:36.360> I<00:06:36.450> said

00:06:36.500 --> 00:06:36.510 
finish the thing because like I said

00:06:36.510 --> 00:06:38.300 
finish the thing because like I said
it's<00:06:36.840> just<00:06:36.900> temporary<00:06:37.410> as<00:06:37.710> is<00:06:37.890> something<00:06:38.220> to

00:06:38.300 --> 00:06:38.310 
it's just temporary as is something to

00:06:38.310 --> 00:06:40.760 
it's just temporary as is something to
show<00:06:38.520> you<00:06:38.580> how<00:06:39.390> easy<00:06:39.420> it<00:06:39.870> is<00:06:39.990> to<00:06:40.050> build<00:06:40.380> a<00:06:40.500> trap

00:06:40.760 --> 00:06:40.770 
show you how easy it is to build a trap

00:06:40.770 --> 00:06:43.760 
show you how easy it is to build a trap
off<00:06:41.010> of<00:06:41.270> what<00:06:42.270> you<00:06:42.450> find<00:06:42.690> in<00:06:42.930> nature<00:06:43.110> or<00:06:43.470> what

00:06:43.760 --> 00:06:43.770 
off of what you find in nature or what

00:06:43.770 --> 00:06:46.400 
off of what you find in nature or what
mother<00:06:44.040> nature<00:06:44.220> provides<00:06:44.760> but<00:06:45.690> uh<00:06:45.720> anyway

00:06:46.400 --> 00:06:46.410 
mother nature provides but uh anyway

00:06:46.410 --> 00:06:50.480 
mother nature provides but uh anyway
there<00:06:47.070> you<00:06:47.220> go<00:06:47.870> the<00:06:48.870> coil<00:06:49.140> trip<00:06:49.440> like<00:06:50.130> i<00:06:50.250> said

00:06:50.480 --> 00:06:50.490 
there you go the coil trip like i said

00:06:50.490 --> 00:06:54.590 
there you go the coil trip like i said
to<00:06:50.730> bait<00:06:50.970> it<00:06:51.770> and<00:06:52.910> don't<00:06:53.910> expect<00:06:54.210> to<00:06:54.390> quit

00:06:54.590 --> 00:06:54.600 
to bait it and don't expect to quit

00:06:54.600 --> 00:06:56.810 
to bait it and don't expect to quit
catch<00:06:54.900> quail<00:06:55.440> right<00:06:55.770> off<00:06:55.920> the<00:06:56.100> bat<00:06:56.310> because

00:07:05.750 --> 00:07:05.760 
a place to put your trap but you want to

00:07:05.760 --> 00:07:09.310 
a place to put your trap but you want to
gather<00:07:05.970> up<00:07:06.240> as<00:07:06.390> much<00:07:06.600> grass<00:07:07.140> seed<00:07:07.530> as<00:07:07.850> you<00:07:08.850> can
