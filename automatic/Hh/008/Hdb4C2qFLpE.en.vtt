00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.030
 and 

00:00:06.430 --> 00:00:13.970
 the topic is pretty ambiguous in 

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:16.760
 title and in the subject and in the disclosure 

00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:19.040
 why why questions like you 

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:21.829
 very many care well, that's derived 

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:24.259
 title variety or hybrid seeds and 

00:00:21.829 --> 00:00:25.270
 seedlings for and against like of course 

00:00:24.259 --> 00:00:28.070
 to tell 

00:00:25.270 --> 00:00:30.560
 boast that all entries are against but 

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:33.050
 it's impossible to do it physically 

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:37.130
 not enough time 

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:39.260
 of our resources to realize all the pros and 

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:40.820
 against for varieties and hybrids will try 

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:43.730
 your vision of this problem to you 

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:46.160
 tell me there's zastavochku 

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:49.039
 just photographed sachets of seeds 

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:51.980
 so that we understand about any hybrids we 

00:00:49.039 --> 00:00:54.769
 today we will mention and say it 

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:57.940
 those that are labeled scientific cultures 

00:00:54.769 --> 00:00:59.600
 f1 i.e. these are first generation hybrids 

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:01.969
 obtained cross-pollination 

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:03.949
 maternal parent plants 

00:01:01.969 --> 00:01:06.890
 that is , this is what is called 

00:01:03.949 --> 00:01:09.920
 hybrids on seeds why the choice will go 

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:13.189
 sort or hybrid sword it is steady then 

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:16.729
 eat seeds collected varietal plants 

00:01:13.189 --> 00:01:18.799
 with a probability of 99 percent saved 

00:01:16.729 --> 00:01:21.439
 properties of the parent plant and you 

00:01:18.799 --> 00:01:24.380
 actually be able to continue 

00:01:21.439 --> 00:01:27.649
 have your seed fund grow 

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:30.979
 plants from their seeds are not dependent on 

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:33.140
 seed sellers from some kind of influence 

00:01:30.979 --> 00:01:35.450
 market and so on but that is very 

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:38.719
 interfered with 

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:40.310
 pollination and exit sustainable 

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:43.039
 states are cucumbers 

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:44.719
 here is here cucumber seeds are held here 

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:47.060
 they just you see that is 

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:49.719
 their pollination goes against them all the time 

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:51.740
 because even the fetal hybrids themselves 

00:01:49.719 --> 00:01:54.399
 pollination occurs 

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:56.689
 any insects close relatives 

00:01:54.399 --> 00:01:59.030
 pumpkin cucumbers and zucchini 

00:01:56.689 --> 00:02:00.229
 melons they have the same thing happening 

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:03.799
 cross-pollination 

00:02:00.229 --> 00:02:07.219
 if it is not a grade then you are actually again 

00:02:03.799 --> 00:02:09.380
 do you lose seeds that you can 

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:12.470
 give the exact same harvest as you 

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:15.950
 wanted to in season 1 but want to emphasize 

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:18.830
 one nuance is the so-called laws 

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:23.060
 market laws the market says that 

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:25.640
 But you need to create conditions when the goods 

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:28.040
 will be bought under any conditions 

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:29.420
 now imagine we got a hybrid 

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:32.360
 have experienced it 

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:34.700
 and it turned out that he is the sort he has 

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:36.410
 all signs of sustainable words but if we 

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:38.240
 let's say publicly what is it 

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:40.070
 steady varieties who will go with us 

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:43.040
 buy these seeds next year 

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:44.890
 After all, we sell people seeds that 

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:47.690
 next year they can collect 

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:49.550
 own harvest new seeds and we them 

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:51.290
 sell nothing worth showing what 

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:53.210
 it's a hybrid guys and you have nothing in 

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:55.310
 next year it will not be here 

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:57.200
 it is natural that you collect and people again 

00:02:55.310 --> 00:03:01.370
 will come to buy the same seeds from you 

00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:04.480
 so I do nâ€™t know exactly which ones 

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:07.490
 these are hybrids by name but what 

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:10.070
 there are such nuances and for now let 

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:12.709
 and some cucumbers 

00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:15.610
 seed manufacturers write on 

00:03:12.709 --> 00:03:19.190
 f1 packs although in fact it is already 

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:21.140
 they are a sort of how to define it 

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:23.720
 conduct their own varietal testing 

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:25.760
 There is such a thing in hybrids as 

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:28.989
 aggressiveness she more inherent 

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:32.500
 transgenic varieties when younger 

00:03:28.989 --> 00:03:35.950
 genetic varieties they exhibit more 

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:38.390
 greater aggression or pushiness and 

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:40.760
 suppress the primordial 

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:42.950
 ancient genetic traits are the same 

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:47.239
 the same thing happens with transgenic 

00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:50.440
 varieties and with some legumes with 

00:03:47.239 --> 00:03:53.450
 some f1 hybrids are themselves 

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:54.820
 retain their signs but on neighbors 

00:03:53.450 --> 00:03:57.440
 may affect 

00:03:54.820 --> 00:03:58.370
 there will be a new pollination 

00:03:57.440 --> 00:04:01.190
 kind of 

00:03:58.370 --> 00:04:03.650
 becomes something between two 

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:05.690
 parents but it will not stop 

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:07.970
 becomes a radiation grade that is here 

00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:10.190
 here is an unstable moment which is hard 

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:14.030
 trace further and so on 

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:17.120
 factor of choice of variety or hybrid can 

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:20.150
 serve either to harvest the given 

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:21.890
 properties or getting your own 

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:23.990
 seed fund everyone should 

00:04:21.890 --> 00:04:26.270
 decide for yourself what is more important to him 

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:28.060
 more important for him every year to receive 

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:30.530
 let's say tomatoes 

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:32.390
 a certain size as president and 

00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:34.510
 if the president's tomatoes though 

00:04:32.390 --> 00:04:37.670
 yes they give a stable harvest 

00:04:34.510 --> 00:04:39.860
 tomatoes one to one pretty thick 

00:04:37.670 --> 00:04:42.050
 skins are juicy and so on there are 

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:44.660
 their description of the variety but 

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:46.670
 the seeds from it are not the fact that they will give you 

00:04:44.660 --> 00:04:48.350
 exactly the same tomatoes next year 

00:04:46.670 --> 00:04:50.450
 you have to buy the same again 

00:04:48.350 --> 00:04:52.370
 touches cucumbers or cabbage 

00:04:50.450 --> 00:04:54.250
 you will not grow seeds either 

00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:57.350
 you will have to buy seeds 

00:04:54.250 --> 00:04:59.690
 certain difficulties therefore if you 

00:04:57.350 --> 00:05:02.000
 need to get a harvest with a clear 

00:04:59.690 --> 00:05:04.370
 certain properties mean you 

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:07.400
 will lean big hybrids have 

00:05:04.370 --> 00:05:10.430
 more nuance is getting earlier 

00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:12.830
 harvest or the simplicity of growing cheers 

00:05:10.430 --> 00:05:15.620
 if you are interested in creating 

00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:18.800
 own seed fund then you 

00:05:15.620 --> 00:05:21.040
 choose varieties for what not to 

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:24.500
 depend on the seed manufacturer and 

00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:26.540
 improve those properties of those crops which 

00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:29.350
 grow applied to your 

00:05:26.540 --> 00:05:29.350
 specific site 

00:05:35.040 --> 00:05:37.040
