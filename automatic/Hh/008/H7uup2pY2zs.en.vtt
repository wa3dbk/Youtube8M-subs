00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.560
 three times 

00:00:01.530 --> 00:00:06.560
 actually after doing the test 

00:00:06.590 --> 00:00:09.520
 here we have 

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:17.340
 in the building there is a lot of distance 

00:00:14.430 --> 00:00:23.400
 to kick now we have 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:31.560
 here it can not be done but good and 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:35.000
 we can see that already in the details of 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:35.000
 the red of the colors 

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:43.930
 works closer and older 

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:56.770
 already with this condition also a light 

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:56.770
 which then also reflects 

00:00:59.059 --> 00:01:06.890
 but the quality I think speaks for itself 

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:10.940
 same this is a picture I think that 

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:10.940
 before you could record alone 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:14.600
 I dont know 

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:21.700
 We are talking 

00:01:19.079 --> 00:01:34.320
 the speaker is the same as the one 

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:34.320
 hesperia z10 seems to me critical 

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:42.130
 a little low we have put a blanket 

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:43.570
 it is not powerful in you 

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:45.020
 I thought that was a little bit 

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:48.159
 bigger 

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:48.159
 and the software that you have put 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:54.730
 [Music] 

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:57.850
 to give then game also to the 

00:01:54.730 --> 00:01:59.560
 photos and videos have gotten good 

00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:02.640
 Yes, of course we have and everything is called 

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:06.100
 the whole software theme 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:08.800
 and will handle the image that is going to 

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:12.240
 manage the image that is connected 

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:12.240
 with the processor the balance 

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:20.190
 the software interface software 

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:20.190
 the interface of things 

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:24.800
