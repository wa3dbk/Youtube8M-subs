it could be a little bit better but it's

00:05:26.699 --> 00:05:28.969 
it could be a little bit better but it's
somewhat<00:05:27.180> better<00:05:27.389> than<00:05:27.509> the<00:05:27.900> stock<00:05:28.710> browser

00:05:28.969 --> 00:05:28.979

but the nokia browser um it can read a

00:06:08.849 --> 00:06:12.920 
but the nokia browser um it can read a
lot<00:06:08.969> Java<00:06:09.330> like<00:06:10.259> the<00:06:10.409> Java<00:06:10.770> flash<00:06:11.599> and<00:06:12.599> I<00:06:12.779> would

00:06:12.920 --> 00:06:12.930 
lot Java like the Java flash and I would

00:06:12.930 --> 00:06:15.290 
lot Java like the Java flash and I would
only<00:06:13.139> you<00:06:13.259> see<00:06:13.469> website<00:06:13.949> it<00:06:14.460> plays<00:06:14.699> that<00:06:14.879> very

work on that I think Nokia is um fixing
these<00:06:28.199> problems<00:06:28.259> are<00:06:28.949> fixing<00:06:29.580> these<00:06:29.699> minor

00:06:30.019 --> 00:06:30.029 
these problems are fixing these minor

00:06:30.029 --> 00:06:33.260 
these problems are fixing these minor
issues<00:06:30.650> so<00:06:31.650> hopefully<00:06:32.490> they'll<00:06:33.029> get<00:06:33.150> that

00:06:33.260 --> 00:06:33.270 
issues so hopefully they'll get that

00:06:33.270 --> 00:06:38.390 
issues so hopefully they'll get that
done<00:06:33.479> fast<00:06:33.719> and<00:06:36.620> one<00:06:37.620> thing<00:06:37.770> I<00:06:37.830> like<00:06:38.009> about<00:06:38.039> it

00:06:38.390 --> 00:06:38.400

00:06:38.400 --> 00:06:41.600 
done fast and one thing I like about it
it's<00:06:38.580> a<00:06:38.759> videophone<00:06:39.150> which<00:06:39.930> I<00:06:40.379> don't<00:06:41.190> think<00:06:41.339> in

00:06:41.600 --> 00:06:41.610 
it's a videophone which I don't think in

00:06:41.610 --> 00:06:44.029 
it's a videophone which I don't think in
the<00:06:41.909> u.s.<00:06:42.210> we<00:06:42.240> have<00:06:42.629> that<00:06:42.839> yet<00:06:43.050> or<00:06:43.289> we<00:06:43.889> don't

00:06:44.029 --> 00:06:44.039 
the u.s. we have that yet or we don't

00:06:44.039 --> 00:06:46.550 
the u.s. we have that yet or we don't
have<00:06:44.159> that<00:06:44.310> for<00:06:44.550> t-mobile<00:06:45.319> so<00:06:46.319> if<00:06:46.379> like<00:06:46.529> a

00:06:46.550 --> 00:06:46.560 
have that for t-mobile so if like a

00:06:46.560 --> 00:06:50.869 
have that for t-mobile so if like a
videophone<00:06:48.680> this<00:06:49.680> has<00:06:49.889> two<00:06:50.159> cameras<00:06:50.639> by<00:06:50.819> the

00:06:50.869 --> 00:06:50.879 
videophone this has two cameras by the

00:06:50.879 --> 00:06:54.860 
videophone this has two cameras by the
way<00:06:52.400> see<00:06:53.400> without<00:06:53.849> shining<00:06:54.300> is<00:06:54.419> I<00:06:54.599> could<00:06:54.750> see
