go<00:00:13.620> to<00:00:13.679> Whiterun<00:00:14.250> but<00:00:15.120> when<00:00:15.240> you<00:00:15.330> open<00:00:15.450> up<00:00:15.630> the

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:15.780 
go to Whiterun but when you open up the

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:19.630 
go to Whiterun but when you open up the
mini-map<00:00:16.369> she<00:00:17.369> it<00:00:17.609> says<00:00:17.880> she's<00:00:18.600> next<00:00:18.869> to<00:00:19.140> the

Giants camp but she's clearly not that

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:25.460 
Giants camp but she's clearly not that
is<00:00:22.980> because<00:00:23.400> you<00:00:23.970> need<00:00:24.090> to<00:00:24.330> escape<00:00:24.960> out<00:00:25.410> of

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:25.470 
is because you need to escape out of

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:27.500 
is because you need to escape out of
