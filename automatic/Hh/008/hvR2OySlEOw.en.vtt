00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.800
 it is possible to eat upside down 

00:00:03.550 --> 00:00:09.400
 there is someone here who has 

00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:12.130
 I tried of course not, but according to 

00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:13.690
 scientific studies and according to good 

00:00:12.130 --> 00:00:16.180
 anyone who knows something about 

00:00:13.690 --> 00:00:18.430
 basic anatomy can know that a 

00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:20.980
 person could eat upside down without 

00:00:18.430 --> 00:00:22.390
 no problem and that is that digestion does not 

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:26.169
 depends on the severity 

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:27.939
 when we swallow something Notice that 

00:00:26.169 --> 00:00:30.970
 we drive the food through 

00:00:27.939 --> 00:00:32.829
 our tongue then the esophagus and then 

00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:36.039
 all the muscles that contract for 

00:00:32.829 --> 00:00:38.590
 pass the food between the different 

00:00:36.039 --> 00:00:41.109
 organs with which we do not need the 

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:43.960
 severity to be able to eat 

00:00:41.109 --> 00:00:46.420
 that's why astronauts can eat with 

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:48.730
 zero gravity can not eat without any 

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:50.500
 problem because at the end of the day they are the 

00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:52.809
 muscle movements those that 

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:55.329
 They make sure that the food goes towards 

00:00:52.809 --> 00:00:58.899
 below and do not enter in addition 

00:00:55.329 --> 00:01:00.629
 lungs you imagine that this process 

00:00:58.899 --> 00:01:03.309
 not done automatically 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:04.629
 when we are swallowing something 

00:01:03.309 --> 00:01:06.460
 the tracks are always closed 

00:01:04.629 --> 00:01:08.409
 respiratory 

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:10.630
 if this did not happen in a way 

00:01:08.409 --> 00:01:12.640
 automatic, the safest thing is that every time 

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:15.400
 that we ate pieces of 

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:16.650
 food to the lung and we were all the 

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:19.210
 day 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:21.640
 coughing good as the human body 

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:25.290
 It is designed in a perfect way and it is 

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:28.390
 able to eat even upside down 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:31.300
 also say that regardless of 

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:33.220
 that there is seriousness or not always 

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:35.680
 vomit you can always expel the 

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:38.110
 food through contractions 

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:40.179
 of the stomach the whole body is full 

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:42.670
 of muscles that are responsible for 

00:01:40.179 --> 00:01:44.770
 transport the food to a fixed place 

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:47.200
 regardless of whether or not there is 

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:50.460
 severity or if you are eating mouth 

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:50.460
 down or anywhere
