00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.899
 of the lunar eclipse that was dyed red 

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:07.740
 also exactly in phenomena 

00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:09.900
 natural the eclipse the moon happens 

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:11.969
 when the planet earth where we live 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:14.460
 It is placed between the sun and the moon 

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:16.800
 then the few light that passes 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:20.250
 of the sun filters them with the atmosphere and 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:23.189
 obviously in Latin now it is the moon with 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:24.600
 we generate a relationship 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:26.849
 optics that is not only white as 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:29.849
 red color these messages of something 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:31.320
 announces something has ever what it is 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:33.930
 what happens in the antiquity of man 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:36.420
 related the arrival of comets or 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:38.190
 also the eclipses true with 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:40.320
 omens is to say that there was a 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:42.390
 manifestation of divine character in 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:44.219
 where the panorama that one of the most 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:46.559
 stable that are the heavens the stars 

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:48.360
 suddenly they had a change if something that 

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:50.190
 it was a wonderful show but so 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:52.559
 some interpret it as a certain 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:55.079
 horror concept as well as a 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:57.030
 warning a kind of punishment now 

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:59.520
 the red moons are less common yet 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:01.500
 now what is the complicated thing that 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:02.460
 four red moons that follow one another 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:06.320
 today 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:08.909
 until September next year 

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:10.470
 finally says they have a date 

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:12.420
 biblical is spoken of four moons of 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:14.520
 blood that could refer to the color that 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:17.159
 it is dyed product of the interference of 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:19.290
 our planet earth and that that's the 

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:20.640
 albor say we would be the previous to a 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:22.200
 series of catastrophes that are 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:23.759
 also linked with books 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:24.990
 revelations apocalypse now saves 

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:26.940
 because there are a series of myths with 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:28.950
 regarding eclipses that for example 

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:30.300
 you can not look directly at it 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:31.590
 is pregnant and I see that they touch the 

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:33.270
 uat the bus will come out with a 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:35.100
 little good story with a control 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:38.700
 much about people the man what 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:40.590
 exact that one touches the guatita a 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:42.600
 pregnant woman and what product of the 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:44.399
 latin moon the guaguita let's say the 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:46.440
 person comes out with stain natural stain 

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:48.539
 of birth exactly is also 

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:50.490
 the saying that for new year I think I think 

00:01:48.539 --> 00:01:51.929
 which is a new year if one shows you to 

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:53.399
 the woman the vote on the moon is made 

00:01:51.929 --> 00:01:55.530
 take out the locks relegated what he 

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:58.100
 It's about heaven will not be easier 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:58.100
 pregnant 

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:03.240
 clear but they have to do more with 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:05.370
 pagan rituals that somehow 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:06.510
 they are related to all 

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:08.520
 natural phenomena that we think 

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:10.229
 amazing and as divine signs there was 

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:11.970
 people who pointed out that it was bad luck 

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:13.290
 take a picture of the moon night that I 

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:15.980
 I had never heard yet 

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:15.980
 our editor 

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:25.010
 speaking the same as yesterday his son sent 

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:41.480
 but you know he does not look at the moon and this 

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:43.130
 it can be very interesting already in a 

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:43.910
 esoteric category and I say esoteric 

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:46.190
 because it is not scientifically 

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:48.980
 proven but you your daily life 

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:51.020
 you can see if this fits you gold and you have 

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:53.270
 to see that the moon does affect the 

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:54.860
 tides if somebody out there said and 

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:57.440
 see what can make a certain sense 

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:58.820
 that no more than 75 percent of what 

00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:02.180
 the structure that makes up the being the 

00:02:58.820 --> 00:03:04.040
 man of water could the moon create 

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:06.170
 effects these people like the case of 

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:08.510
 the lunatics that you see let's say 

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:10.430
 as if it is true the inner flow 

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:11.750
 they had mobilized and indeed the moon 

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:13.940
 is connected to the cycles 

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:15.860
 women's menstruals that is the moon 

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:17.780
 it's like feminine indeed in the 

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:20.240
 ancient healing cultures like the 

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:21.980
 Acupuncture understands that women have 

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:23.690
 a direct association with the changes 

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:26.390
 phase and moods of the 

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:28.010
 women and that man is like the sun and 

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:29.870
 this me peak meters orders as you are 

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:32.150
 as the sun comes out every day and 

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:33.530
 always the same has to do with the 

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:35.300
 direction and the power of 

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:36.770
 predisposition of man sex action 

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:38.990
 women have a 

00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:43.330
 and let's say more about fertility and so on 

00:03:38.990 --> 00:03:43.330
 etcetera to all this why
