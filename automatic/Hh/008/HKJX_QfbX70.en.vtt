learning Leslie it's gonna share with us

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:15.259 
learning Leslie it's gonna share with us
when<00:00:10.980> and<00:00:11.280> why<00:00:11.790> to<00:00:12.150> stand<00:00:12.509> on<00:00:12.630> your<00:00:12.780> pedals<00:00:14.269> so

00:00:15.259 --> 00:00:15.269 
when and why to stand on your pedals so

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:17.330 
when and why to stand on your pedals so
we<00:00:15.330> have<00:00:15.420> lots<00:00:15.570> of<00:00:15.750> riders<00:00:16.139> ask<00:00:16.410> when<00:00:17.070> that

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:17.340 
we have lots of riders ask when that

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:20.660 
we have lots of riders ask when that
they<00:00:17.460> should<00:00:17.670> stand<00:00:18.119> on<00:00:18.420> their<00:00:18.570> bikes<00:00:18.840> and<00:00:19.670> it

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:20.670 
they should stand on their bikes and it

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:23.509 
they should stand on their bikes and it
comes<00:00:20.970> it's<00:00:21.810> not<00:00:21.900> always<00:00:22.230> that<00:00:22.350> easy<00:00:22.619> to<00:00:23.310> learn

00:00:23.509 --> 00:00:23.519 
comes it's not always that easy to learn

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:24.920 
comes it's not always that easy to learn
to<00:00:23.760> stand<00:00:23.970> in<00:00:24.210> the<00:00:24.300> beginning<00:00:24.660> when<00:00:24.779> you<00:00:24.900> first

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:24.930 
to stand in the beginning when you first

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:27.170 
to stand in the beginning when you first
start<00:00:25.410> riding<00:00:25.619> and<00:00:26.010> once<00:00:26.369> your<00:00:26.550> muscles<00:00:26.939> get

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:27.180 
start riding and once your muscles get

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:29.990 
start riding and once your muscles get
used<00:00:27.480> to<00:00:27.869> the<00:00:28.470> action<00:00:28.980> just<00:00:29.369> like<00:00:29.490> anything

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:30.000 
used to the action just like anything

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:31.730 
used to the action just like anything
you<00:00:30.119> have<00:00:30.240> to<00:00:30.269> adapt<00:00:30.720> to<00:00:30.750> it<00:00:30.960> and<00:00:31.260> get<00:00:31.410> strong

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:31.740 
you have to adapt to it and get strong

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:35.540 
you have to adapt to it and get strong
enough<00:00:31.890> to<00:00:32.099> stand<00:00:32.369> and<00:00:32.989> also<00:00:33.989> you<00:00:34.050> have<00:00:34.290> to<00:00:34.550> be

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:35.550 
enough to stand and also you have to be

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:36.950 
enough to stand and also you have to be
comfortable<00:00:36.000> with<00:00:36.210> your<00:00:36.390> balance<00:00:36.780> on<00:00:36.899> the

bike because the bike is you you have to
get<00:00:39.149> comfortable<00:00:39.510> with<00:00:39.750> moving<00:00:39.989> it<00:00:40.230> around

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
get comfortable with moving it around

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:43.760 
get comfortable with moving it around
underneath<00:00:40.890> you<00:00:41.219> but<00:00:41.940> basically<00:00:42.590> the<00:00:43.590> other

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:43.770 
underneath you but basically the other

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:46.100 
underneath you but basically the other
the<00:00:44.040> reasons<00:00:44.370> that<00:00:44.460> we<00:00:44.610> teach<00:00:44.940> to<00:00:45.239> stand<00:00:45.809> or

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.110 
the reasons that we teach to stand or

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:48.350 
the reasons that we teach to stand or
the<00:00:46.140> uses<00:00:46.530> for<00:00:46.680> standing<00:00:47.100> are<00:00:47.250> number<00:00:48.180> one

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
the uses for standing are number one

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:50.180 
the uses for standing are number one
would<00:00:48.600> be<00:00:48.629> to<00:00:49.200> get<00:00:49.320> on<00:00:49.410> top<00:00:49.620> of<00:00:49.680> your<00:00:49.980> gear

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
would be to get on top of your gear

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:52.639 
would be to get on top of your gear
quite<00:00:50.550> often<00:00:50.820> you<00:00:51.090> might<00:00:51.270> be<00:00:51.449> climbing<00:00:52.350> in<00:00:52.559> a

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649 
quite often you might be climbing in a

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:55.580 
quite often you might be climbing in a
gear<00:00:53.010> it's<00:00:53.489> you<00:00:53.940> don't<00:00:54.059> really<00:00:54.449> need<00:00:54.870> to<00:00:54.930> go

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
gear it's you don't really need to go

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:57.290 
gear it's you don't really need to go
into<00:00:55.620> an<00:00:55.920> easier<00:00:56.309> gear<00:00:56.550> shift<00:00:56.879> down<00:00:57.059> to<00:00:57.210> an

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 
into an easier gear shift down to an

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:00.049 
into an easier gear shift down to an
easier<00:00:57.629> gear<00:00:57.930> but<00:00:58.440> just<00:00:58.620> by<00:00:58.770> standing<00:00:59.070> you<00:00:59.609> can

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
easier gear but just by standing you can

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:02.119 
easier gear but just by standing you can
get<00:01:00.239> on<00:01:00.449> top<00:01:00.780> we<00:01:00.960> call<00:01:01.289> it<00:01:01.410> getting<00:01:01.620> on<00:01:01.739> top<00:01:02.100> of

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
get on top we call it getting on top of

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:04.850 
get on top we call it getting on top of
the<00:01:02.489> pedals<00:01:03.000> so<00:01:03.210> that<00:01:03.930> would<00:01:04.110> be<00:01:04.290> standing

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
the pedals so that would be standing

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:07.160 
the pedals so that would be standing
sing<00:01:05.159> in<00:01:05.339> the<00:01:05.430> same<00:01:05.640> gear<00:01:05.939> and<00:01:06.150> just<00:01:06.630> getting

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
sing in the same gear and just getting

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:08.960 
sing in the same gear and just getting
on<00:01:07.260> top<00:01:07.560> of<00:01:07.770> the<00:01:07.830> pedals<00:01:08.159> and<00:01:08.340> staying<00:01:08.700> in<00:01:08.939> that

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
on top of the pedals and staying in that

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:11.600 
on top of the pedals and staying in that
gear<00:01:09.479> to<00:01:10.320> maintain<00:01:10.710> the<00:01:10.860> speed<00:01:11.130> of<00:01:11.250> your<00:01:11.280> bike

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
gear to maintain the speed of your bike

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:14.330 
gear to maintain the speed of your bike
another<00:01:12.420> reason<00:01:12.689> to<00:01:12.869> stand<00:01:13.200> would<00:01:13.860> be<00:01:14.070> on<00:01:14.310> a

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
another reason to stand would be on a

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:16.460 
another reason to stand would be on a
long<00:01:14.610> climb<00:01:14.909> for<00:01:15.240> example<00:01:15.659> say<00:01:15.840> around<00:01:16.080> here

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470 
long climb for example say around here

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:18.039 
long climb for example say around here
we<00:01:16.619> have<00:01:16.650> a<00:01:16.830> couple<00:01:17.070> of<00:01:17.280> pretty<00:01:17.430> long<00:01:17.700> climbs

00:01:18.039 --> 00:01:18.049 
we have a couple of pretty long climbs

00:01:18.049 --> 00:01:20.570 
we have a couple of pretty long climbs
that<00:01:19.049> a<00:01:19.110> lot<00:01:19.259> of<00:01:19.290> people<00:01:19.560> are<00:01:19.650> training<00:01:19.920> on<00:01:20.189> for

and<00:01:30.509> and<00:01:30.710> butt<00:01:31.710> muscles<00:01:32.159> so<00:01:32.579> by<00:01:32.700> standing<00:01:33.210> you

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
and and butt muscles so by standing you

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:35.210 
and and butt muscles so by standing you
can<00:01:33.509> change<00:01:33.780> up<00:01:33.960> the<00:01:33.990> muscle<00:01:34.409> groups<00:01:34.650> get<00:01:35.189> a

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:35.220 
can change up the muscle groups get a

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:36.890 
can change up the muscle groups get a
little<00:01:35.520> bit<00:01:35.640> of<00:01:35.759> a<00:01:35.820> break<00:01:36.060> a<00:01:36.090> little<00:01:36.420> bit<00:01:36.689> of<00:01:36.810> a

little bit of a break a little bit of a

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:39.800 
little bit of a break a little bit of a
reprieve<00:01:37.619> standing<00:01:38.549> also<00:01:39.000> is<00:01:39.329> a<00:01:39.360> good<00:01:39.600> way<00:01:39.659> to

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810 
reprieve standing also is a good way to

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:42.230 
reprieve standing also is a good way to
give<00:01:40.020> a<00:01:40.049> little<00:01:40.229> stretch<00:01:40.470> of<00:01:40.860> your<00:01:41.070> back<00:01:41.310> so<00:01:41.790> by
