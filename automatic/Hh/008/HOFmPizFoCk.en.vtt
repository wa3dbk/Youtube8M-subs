again but I'm going to get the little
ones<00:04:11.209> and<00:04:11.600> try<00:04:12.260> those<00:04:12.560> and<00:04:12.859> no<00:04:13.220> should<00:04:13.579> come

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:13.730 
ones and try those and no should come

00:04:13.730 --> 00:04:16.520 
ones and try those and no should come
out<00:04:13.850> to<00:04:13.910> be<00:04:14.769> like

00:04:16.520 --> 00:04:16.530 
out to be like

00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:21.199 
out to be like
this<00:04:16.980> ice<00:04:17.660> for<00:04:18.660> the<00:04:18.750> little<00:04:18.989> ones<00:04:19.820> which<00:04:20.820> are

00:04:21.199 --> 00:04:21.209 
this ice for the little ones which are

00:04:21.209 --> 00:04:25.490 
this ice for the little ones which are
definitely<00:04:21.690> smaller<00:04:22.049> than<00:04:22.200> those<00:04:24.470> so<00:04:25.470> I

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:25.500 
definitely smaller than those so I

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:27.290 
definitely smaller than those so I
figured<00:04:26.010> I'd<00:04:26.130> give<00:04:26.280> it<00:04:26.310> a<00:04:26.430> whirl<00:04:26.460> and<00:04:26.910> see<00:04:27.000> how

00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:27.300 
figured I'd give it a whirl and see how

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:30.080 
figured I'd give it a whirl and see how
it<00:04:27.450> goes<00:04:27.660> but<00:04:28.020> you<00:04:29.010> can<00:04:29.190> make<00:04:29.310> a<00:04:29.340> whole<00:04:29.639> slew<00:04:30.060> of

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:30.090 
it goes but you can make a whole slew of

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:32.240 
it goes but you can make a whole slew of
these<00:04:30.389> and<00:04:31.139> like<00:04:31.410> put<00:04:31.620> them<00:04:31.680> in<00:04:31.830> like<00:04:31.950> a<00:04:31.980> little

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:32.250 
these and like put them in like a little

00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:33.830 
these and like put them in like a little
container<00:04:32.610> or<00:04:32.880> whatever<00:04:33.150> so<00:04:33.360> you<00:04:33.450> have<00:04:33.600> on<00:04:33.720> my

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:33.840 
container or whatever so you have on my

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:35.330 
container or whatever so you have on my
hand<00:04:34.169> and<00:04:34.500> they<00:04:34.650> have<00:04:34.770> all<00:04:34.919> different<00:04:35.100> colors
