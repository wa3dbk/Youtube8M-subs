00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:11.190 
this stuff but there's kind of a

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:13.730 
this stuff but there's kind of a
two-pronged<00:01:12.180> issue<00:01:12.479> with<00:01:12.780> this<00:01:12.990> number<00:01:13.470> one

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
two-pronged issue with this number one

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:15.889 
two-pronged issue with this number one
it's<00:01:14.070> expensive<00:01:14.610> because<00:01:15.210> you<00:01:15.420> know<00:01:15.540> you<00:01:15.600> have

00:01:15.889 --> 00:01:15.899 
it's expensive because you know you have

00:01:15.899 --> 00:01:18.740 
it's expensive because you know you have
to<00:01:16.020> make<00:01:16.200> that<00:01:16.410> little<00:01:16.649> fake<00:01:17.280> phone<00:01:17.759> and<00:01:18.210> then

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
to make that little fake phone and then

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:20.510 
to make that little fake phone and then
you<00:01:18.960> have<00:01:19.140> to<00:01:19.350> hopefully<00:01:19.710> at<00:01:20.039> some<00:01:20.070> point

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
you have to hopefully at some point

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:23.450 
you have to hopefully at some point
maybe<00:01:20.940> you<00:01:21.180> fake<00:01:21.570> that<00:01:21.600> it<00:01:21.899> works<00:01:22.140> so<00:01:22.920> there's

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
maybe you fake that it works so there's

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:24.920 
maybe you fake that it works so there's
a<00:01:23.550> lot<00:01:23.940> that<00:01:24.000> goes<00:01:24.180> into<00:01:24.300> that<00:01:24.600> and<00:01:24.720> the<00:01:24.810> other

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930 
a lot that goes into that and the other

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:28.219 
a lot that goes into that and the other
thing<00:01:25.050> is<00:01:25.229> is<00:01:25.530> it's<00:01:26.009> really<00:01:26.520> hard<00:01:26.880> to<00:01:27.539> not<00:01:27.570> know

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
thing is is it's really hard to not know

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:31.700 
thing is is it's really hard to not know
which<00:01:28.530> one<00:01:28.800> is<00:01:29.100> the<00:01:29.460> real<00:01:29.670> one<00:01:29.940> based<00:01:30.869> on<00:01:31.140> the

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
which one is the real one based on the

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:33.380 
which one is the real one based on the
amount<00:01:32.039> of<00:01:32.220> leaks<00:01:32.460> so<00:01:32.700> you're<00:01:32.940> still<00:01:33.270> gonna

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
amount of leaks so you're still gonna

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:35.420 
amount of leaks so you're still gonna
see<00:01:33.630> those<00:01:33.810> leaks<00:01:34.080> from<00:01:34.229> factories<00:01:34.860> saying

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430 
see those leaks from factories saying

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:37.999 
see those leaks from factories saying
okay<00:01:35.820> hey<00:01:36.030> well<00:01:36.300> here's<00:01:36.630> you<00:01:36.990> know<00:01:37.110> the<00:01:37.320> the

00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:41.009 
new screen for the iPad or hears you

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:43.370 
new screen for the iPad or hears you
know<00:01:41.130> this<00:01:41.490> piece<00:01:42.030> from<00:01:42.479> this<00:01:42.720> home<00:01:43.050> button

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380 
know this piece from this home button

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:45.499 
know this piece from this home button
from<00:01:43.710> this<00:01:44.009> device<00:01:44.369> and<00:01:44.670> the<00:01:45.030> thing<00:01:45.179> is<00:01:45.240> is

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:45.509 
from this device and the thing is is

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:47.240 
from this device and the thing is is
there's<00:01:45.780> no<00:01:45.990> way<00:01:46.200> to<00:01:46.259> really<00:01:46.530> spot<00:01:46.979> that

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:47.250 
there's no way to really spot that

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:50.270 
there's no way to really spot that
avalanche<00:01:47.819> so<00:01:48.330> I<00:01:48.720> think<00:01:49.050> OEM<00:01:49.709> is<00:01:49.860> having<00:01:50.160> this

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280 
avalanche so I think OEM is having this

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:52.190 
avalanche so I think OEM is having this
like<00:01:50.520> sort<00:01:50.789> of<00:01:50.940> side<00:01:51.179> small<00:01:51.660> Avalanche

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:52.200 
like sort of side small Avalanche

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:53.930 
like sort of side small Avalanche
compared<00:01:52.649> to<00:01:52.709> this<00:01:52.830> like<00:01:53.039> huge<00:01:53.250> avalanche<00:01:53.550> of

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:53.940 
compared to this like huge avalanche of

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:55.880 
compared to this like huge avalanche of
actual<00:01:54.479> leaks<00:01:54.810> makes<00:01:55.410> it<00:01:55.560> a<00:01:55.619> little<00:01:55.740> bit

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:55.890 
actual leaks makes it a little bit

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:58.219 
actual leaks makes it a little bit
impossible<00:01:56.490> but<00:01:56.700> I<00:01:56.759> am<00:01:57.240> totally<00:01:57.539> off<00:01:57.840> for<00:01:58.080> it<00:01:58.170> I

00:01:58.219 --> 00:01:58.229 
impossible but I am totally off for it I

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:00.230 
impossible but I am totally off for it I
think<00:01:58.289> it'd<00:01:58.470> be<00:01:58.560> hilarious<00:01:58.649> Josh<00:01:59.580> asks<00:02:00.090> hey

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:00.240 
think it'd be hilarious Josh asks hey

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:02.029 
think it'd be hilarious Josh asks hey

choosing between the ipad air which is
very<00:02:12.510> very<00:02:12.780> light<00:02:12.989> now<00:02:13.200> at<00:02:13.380> one<00:02:13.620> pound<00:02:13.950> and<00:02:14.280> the

very very light now at one pound and the

00:02:14.489 --> 00:02:16.280 
very very light now at one pound and the
ipad<00:02:14.849> mini<00:02:15.030> with<00:02:15.150> retina<00:02:15.209> which<00:02:15.630> is<00:02:15.840> the

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:16.290 
ipad mini with retina which is the

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:19.040 
ipad mini with retina which is the
portability<00:02:16.890> that<00:02:17.340> I<00:02:17.370> wanted<00:02:17.970> and<00:02:18.239> the

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:19.050 
portability that I wanted and the

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:21.320 
portability that I wanted and the
display<00:02:19.680> that<00:02:19.890> I<00:02:19.950> wanted<00:02:20.459> but<00:02:20.910> here's<00:02:21.239> the

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:21.330 
display that I wanted but here's the

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:22.640 
display that I wanted but here's the
thing<00:02:21.420> so<00:02:21.810> I've<00:02:22.020> been<00:02:22.110> thinking<00:02:22.170> a<00:02:22.470> lot<00:02:22.500> about

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:22.650 
thing so I've been thinking a lot about

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:24.440 
thing so I've been thinking a lot about
this<00:02:23.010> and<00:02:23.220> for<00:02:23.640> one<00:02:23.730> hundred<00:02:23.790> dollars<00:02:24.150> cheaper

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:24.450 
this and for one hundred dollars cheaper

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:27.050 
this and for one hundred dollars cheaper
than<00:02:25.080> an<00:02:25.260> ipad<00:02:25.650> air<00:02:25.860> you<00:02:26.370> can<00:02:26.520> get<00:02:26.640> an<00:02:26.730> ipad

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:27.060 
than an ipad air you can get an ipad

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:29.059 
than an ipad air you can get an ipad
mini<00:02:27.270> with<00:02:27.450> the<00:02:27.599> exact<00:02:28.110> same<00:02:28.140> specs<00:02:28.770> and

00:02:29.059 --> 00:02:29.069 
mini with the exact same specs and

00:02:29.069 --> 00:02:30.890 
mini with the exact same specs and
that's<00:02:29.220> different<00:02:29.760> than<00:02:29.970> last<00:02:30.209> year's<00:02:30.569> iPad

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:30.900 
that's different than last year's iPad

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:32.900 
that's different than last year's iPad
Mini<00:02:31.110> which<00:02:31.319> was<00:02:31.470> running<00:02:31.830> on<00:02:31.980> a<00:02:32.040> processor

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:32.910 
Mini which was running on a processor

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:35.300 
Mini which was running on a processor
that<00:02:32.940> was<00:02:33.239> one<00:02:33.569> generation<00:02:33.989> behind<00:02:34.290> the<00:02:34.920> ipad

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:35.310 
that was one generation behind the ipad

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:39.380 
that was one generation behind the ipad
4<00:02:35.700> so<00:02:36.360> i<00:02:36.750> think<00:02:36.959> if<00:02:37.530> you<00:02:37.590> have<00:02:38.400> the<00:02:38.730> ability<00:02:39.360> to

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:39.390 
4 so i think if you have the ability to

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:42.140 
4 so i think if you have the ability to
get<00:02:39.810> the<00:02:40.140> exact<00:02:40.620> same<00:02:40.860> specs<00:02:41.310> a<00:02:41.580> better

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:42.150 
get the exact same specs a better

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:44.510 
get the exact same specs a better
resolutions<00:02:42.989> you're<00:02:43.140> getting<00:02:43.349> better<00:02:43.500> ppi<00:02:44.010> on

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:44.520 
resolutions you're getting better ppi on

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:46.010 
resolutions you're getting better ppi on
the<00:02:44.670> ipad<00:02:45.030> mini<00:02:45.239> with<00:02:45.390> retina<00:02:45.450> because

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:46.020 
the ipad mini with retina because

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:48.199 
the ipad mini with retina because
they're<00:02:46.200> the<00:02:46.379> same<00:02:46.620> resolution<00:02:47.040> and<00:02:47.610> the<00:02:47.790> ipad

00:02:48.199 --> 00:02:48.209 
they're the same resolution and the ipad

00:02:48.209 --> 00:02:50.090 
they're the same resolution and the ipad
air<00:02:48.450> is<00:02:48.690> bigger<00:02:49.050> you're<00:02:49.530> spending<00:02:49.920> less<00:02:50.070> money

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:50.100 
air is bigger you're spending less money

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:52.280 
air is bigger you're spending less money
and<00:02:50.520> also<00:02:50.940> the<00:02:51.240> exact<00:02:51.480> same<00:02:51.690> specs<00:02:52.020> so

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:52.290 
and also the exact same specs so

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:53.590 
and also the exact same specs so
honestly<00:02:52.890> for<00:02:53.130> me<00:02:53.190> I<00:02:53.280> think

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:53.600 
honestly for me I think

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:54.700 
honestly for me I think
it's<00:02:53.660> gonna<00:02:53.750> be<00:02:53.930> the<00:02:54.050> ipad<00:02:54.350> mini<00:02:54.380> with<00:02:54.650> retina

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:54.710 
it's gonna be the ipad mini with retina

00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:56.770 
it's gonna be the ipad mini with retina
so<00:02:55.190> that's<00:02:55.340> my<00:02:55.520> choice<00:02:55.730> twitter<00:02:56.270> user<00:02:56.510> at

00:02:56.770 --> 00:02:56.780

think HTC will make another version of
the<00:03:02.360> one<00:03:02.750> max<00:03:03.080> that<00:03:03.410> will<00:03:03.500> have<00:03:03.650> better<00:03:03.890> specs

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:04.430 
the one max that will have better specs

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:08.770 
hashtag ass the bee this is kind of a
tough<00:03:06.830> question<00:03:06.980> because<00:03:07.370> obviously<00:03:07.790> HTC<00:03:08.630> is

00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:08.780 
tough question because obviously HTC is

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:10.240 
tough question because obviously HTC is
going<00:03:08.960> to<00:03:09.020> make<00:03:09.200> better<00:03:09.440> phones<00:03:09.890> going

going to make better phones going

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:11.740 
going to make better phones going
forward<00:03:10.820> and<00:03:11.090> they're<00:03:11.420> going<00:03:11.540> to<00:03:11.630> have

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:11.750

forward and they're going to have
updated<00:03:12.080> specs<00:03:12.470> I<00:03:12.680> don't<00:03:13.040> know<00:03:13.220> that<00:03:13.640> the<00:03:14.480> one

00:03:14.710 --> 00:03:14.720 
updated specs I don't know that the one

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:16.720 
updated specs I don't know that the one
max<00:03:14.990> is<00:03:15.230> gonna<00:03:15.350> see<00:03:15.620> an<00:03:15.770> update<00:03:16.220> with<00:03:16.400> specs

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:16.730 
max is gonna see an update with specs

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:19.270 
max is gonna see an update with specs
however<00:03:17.450> we<00:03:17.780> may<00:03:18.020> see<00:03:18.080> something<00:03:18.530> like<00:03:18.680> the

00:03:19.270 --> 00:03:19.280 
however we may see something like the

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:21.310 
however we may see something like the
butterfly<00:03:19.460> s<00:03:19.940> which<00:03:20.300> had<00:03:20.540> better<00:03:20.780> specs<00:03:21.170> than

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:21.320 
butterfly s which had better specs than

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:23.980 
butterfly s which had better specs than
the<00:03:21.740> one<00:03:21.920> so<00:03:22.490> we<00:03:22.790> may<00:03:22.940> not<00:03:23.150> see<00:03:23.480> it<00:03:23.510> everywhere

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:23.990 
the one so we may not see it everywhere

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:25.660 
the one so we may not see it everywhere
globally<00:03:24.530> but<00:03:24.890> it<00:03:25.040> is<00:03:25.190> of<00:03:25.370> course<00:03:25.400> possible

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:25.670 
globally but it is of course possible

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:27.580 
globally but it is of course possible
that<00:03:26.180> will<00:03:26.270> see<00:03:26.420> a<00:03:26.450> phone<00:03:26.690> like<00:03:26.870> that<00:03:26.900> I<00:03:27.260> think

been a great way to sort of steel a
little<00:04:03.350> bit<00:04:03.470> of<00:04:03.560> apples<00:04:03.920> thunder<00:04:04.310> with<00:04:05.030> the

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:05.150 
little bit of apples thunder with the

little bit of apples thunder with the
ipad<00:04:05.540> event<00:04:05.780> but<00:04:06.110> who<00:04:06.770> knows<00:04:06.950> i<00:04:07.280> mean<00:04:07.460> last

00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:07.700 
ipad event but who knows i mean last

00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:09.940 
ipad event but who knows i mean last
year<00:04:07.910> if<00:04:08.420> i<00:04:08.570> recall<00:04:08.810> correctly<00:04:09.020> and<00:04:09.650> i<00:04:09.710> could

00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:09.950 
year if i recall correctly and i could

00:04:09.950 --> 00:04:12.490 
year if i recall correctly and i could
be<00:04:10.100> wrong<00:04:10.130> I<00:04:10.550> think<00:04:11.090> that<00:04:11.630> the<00:04:11.810> nexus<00:04:12.140> event

00:04:12.490 --> 00:04:12.500 
be wrong I think that the nexus event

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:14.590 
be wrong I think that the nexus event
was<00:04:12.800> the<00:04:13.070> release<00:04:13.790> of<00:04:13.940> the<00:04:14.000> devices<00:04:14.270> were<00:04:14.480> in

00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:14.600 
was the release of the devices were in

00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:16.630 
was the release of the devices were in
november<00:04:15.080> or<00:04:15.260> maybe<00:04:15.620> even<00:04:15.680> early<00:04:16.130> december

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:16.640 
november or maybe even early december

00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:17.860 
november or maybe even early december
now<00:04:16.850> that<00:04:17.000> I'm<00:04:17.090> thinking<00:04:17.120> about<00:04:17.450> it<00:04:17.690> but<00:04:17.720> it

00:04:17.860 --> 00:04:17.870 
now that I'm thinking about it but it

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:19.630 
now that I'm thinking about it but it
was<00:04:18.020> a<00:04:18.049> little<00:04:18.350> later<00:04:18.710> in<00:04:18.890> the<00:04:18.980> year<00:04:19.070> so<00:04:19.430> don't

00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:19.640 
was a little later in the year so don't

00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:21.940 
was a little later in the year so don't
fret<00:04:20.090> I<00:04:20.450> don't<00:04:20.720> think<00:04:20.780> anything's<00:04:21.320> wrong<00:04:21.620> I

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:21.950 
fret I don't think anything's wrong I

00:04:21.950 --> 00:04:24.040 
fret I don't think anything's wrong I
think<00:04:22.190> that<00:04:22.340> they<00:04:22.490> are<00:04:22.520> maybe<00:04:23.360> just<00:04:23.660> making<00:04:23.930> a

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:24.050 
think that they are maybe just making a

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:25.510 
think that they are maybe just making a
couple<00:04:24.320> of<00:04:24.410> final<00:04:24.650> tweaks<00:04:24.980> before<00:04:25.310> there<00:04:25.490> are

00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:25.520 
couple of final tweaks before there are

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:28.090 
couple of final tweaks before there are
fully<00:04:26.060> prepared<00:04:26.480> to<00:04:27.260> release<00:04:27.410> it<00:04:27.710> and<00:04:27.830> really
