any case it's basically the conclusion
of<00:04:47.440> this<00:04:47.590> game<00:04:47.950> is<00:04:48.160> that<00:04:48.340> it<00:04:48.640> would<00:04:48.970> not<00:04:49.120> be

00:04:49.230 --> 00:04:49.240 
of this game is that it would not be

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:51.540 
of this game is that it would not be
working<00:04:49.390> we<00:04:49.720> points<00:04:50.230> unless<00:04:50.740> you're<00:04:50.950> super

hardcore Yoshi / mario fan I'd suggest

00:04:55.690 --> 00:04:58.140 
hardcore Yoshi / mario fan I'd suggest
keeping<00:04:55.840> away<00:04:56.260> from<00:04:56.290> the<00:04:56.530> game<00:04:56.710> it's<00:04:57.670> too

00:04:58.140 --> 00:04:58.150 
keeping away from the game it's too

00:04:58.150 --> 00:04:59.640 
keeping away from the game it's too
short<00:04:58.390> I<00:04:58.600> mean<00:04:58.720> there's<00:04:58.900> nothing<00:04:58.990> wrong<00:04:59.590> with

00:04:59.640 --> 00:04:59.650 
short I mean there's nothing wrong with

00:04:59.650 --> 00:05:01.200 
short I mean there's nothing wrong with
the<00:04:59.860> gameplay<00:05:00.340> I<00:05:00.370> mean<00:05:00.700> other<00:05:00.910> than<00:05:01.000> the<00:05:01.090> fact

00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:01.210 
the gameplay I mean other than the fact

00:05:01.210 --> 00:05:03.540 
the gameplay I mean other than the fact
it<00:05:01.660> does<00:05:01.870> get<00:05:02.020> kind<00:05:02.290> of<00:05:02.410> glitchy<00:05:03.160> after<00:05:03.520> a

00:05:03.540 --> 00:05:03.550 
it does get kind of glitchy after a

00:05:03.550 --> 00:05:05.700 
it does get kind of glitchy after a
while<00:05:03.820> you<00:05:04.210> know<00:05:04.330> enemies<00:05:04.840> are<00:05:04.870> so<00:05:05.200> freaking

00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:05.710 
while you know enemies are so freaking

00:05:05.710 --> 00:05:07.290 
while you know enemies are so freaking
easy<00:05:05.890> it's<00:05:06.130> like<00:05:06.400> you<00:05:06.610> breathe<00:05:06.940> through<00:05:07.240> the

00:05:07.290 --> 00:05:07.300 
easy it's like you breathe through the

00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:11.250 
easy it's like you breathe through the
game<00:05:08.100> this<00:05:09.100> footage<00:05:09.460> I<00:05:09.580> got<00:05:09.820> funny<00:05:10.570> enough<00:05:10.750> was

00:05:11.250 --> 00:05:11.260 
game this footage I got funny enough was

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:15.390 
game this footage I got funny enough was
basically<00:05:12.090> the<00:05:13.140> c-stick<00:05:14.140> Steve<00:05:14.860> buttons<00:05:15.280> on

00:05:15.390 --> 00:05:15.400 
basically the c-stick Steve buttons on

00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:16.890 
basically the c-stick Steve buttons on
the<00:05:15.490> controller<00:05:15.880> we're<00:05:16.180> not<00:05:16.300> working<00:05:16.540> so

00:05:16.890 --> 00:05:16.900

00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:18.120 
the controller we're not working so
basically<00:05:17.200> I<00:05:17.260> was<00:05:17.320> not<00:05:17.500> able<00:05:17.650> to<00:05:17.830> go<00:05:17.950> through
