00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:33.560 
this one hopefully this one is a much

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:35.350 
this one hopefully this one is a much
like<00:02:33.769> the<00:02:33.950> original<00:02:34.430> and<00:02:34.580> its<00:02:34.670> reliability<00:02:35.120> is

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:35.360 
like the original and its reliability is

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:37.390 
like the original and its reliability is
ok<00:02:35.660> I<00:02:35.870> wouldn't<00:02:36.590> doubt<00:02:36.709> it<00:02:36.860> coming<00:02:37.099> from<00:02:37.160> king

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:37.400 
ok I wouldn't doubt it coming from king

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:44.420 
ok I wouldn't doubt it coming from king
arms<00:02:38.049> all<00:02:39.049> right<00:02:39.260> let's<00:02:39.440> cram<00:02:39.680> let's<00:02:40.099> do<00:02:40.250> it

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:44.430 

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:46.980 

so<00:02:45.430> for<00:02:45.700> the<00:02:45.760> Overland<00:02:46.180> arms<00:02:46.450> we<00:02:46.570> got<00:02:46.690> a<00:02:46.720> clock

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:46.990 
so for the Overland arms we got a clock

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:49.320 
so for the Overland arms we got a clock
in<00:02:47.140> about<00:02:47.320> 370<00:02:48.070> feet<00:02:48.220> per<00:02:48.370> second<00:02:48.730> which<00:02:49.090> isn't

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:49.330 
in about 370 feet per second which isn't

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:52.110 
in about 370 feet per second which isn't
bad<00:02:49.360> again<00:02:49.840> you<00:02:50.260> know<00:02:50.350> it's<00:02:50.890> really<00:02:51.070> it's<00:02:51.850> got

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:52.120 
bad again you know it's really it's got

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:53.550 
bad again you know it's really it's got
a<00:02:52.150> really<00:02:52.360> nice<00:02:52.570> happy<00:02:52.840> medium<00:02:52.990> right<00:02:53.350> where<00:02:53.530> I

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:53.560 
a really nice happy medium right where I

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:56.100 
a really nice happy medium right where I
like<00:02:53.740> all<00:02:53.890> of<00:02:53.980> my<00:02:54.100> gun<00:02:54.310> shooting<00:02:54.610> yet<00:02:54.730> now<00:02:55.390> it

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:56.110 
like all of my gun shooting yet now it

00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:58.920 
like all of my gun shooting yet now it
does<00:02:56.350> have<00:02:56.620> a<00:02:56.680> very<00:02:57.040> very<00:02:57.250> high<00:02:57.580> pitch<00:02:57.930> motor

00:02:58.920 --> 00:02:58.930 
does have a very very high pitch motor

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:01.380 
does have a very very high pitch motor
so<00:02:59.350> make<00:02:59.830> sure<00:02:59.860> it's<00:03:00.220> properly<00:03:00.610> adjusted<00:03:01.150> and

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:01.390 
so make sure it's properly adjusted and

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:03.690 
so make sure it's properly adjusted and
it<00:03:01.540> probably<00:03:01.990> could<00:03:02.620> afford<00:03:02.650> to<00:03:03.010> be<00:03:03.220> shimmed

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:03.700 
it probably could afford to be shimmed

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:05.730 
it probably could afford to be shimmed
that's<00:03:04.210> what<00:03:04.420> I<00:03:04.450> would<00:03:04.690> do<00:03:04.840> if<00:03:04.990> I<00:03:05.110> if<00:03:05.380> I<00:03:05.500> pick

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:05.740 
that's what I would do if I if I pick

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:08.760 
that's what I would do if I if I pick
this<00:03:05.860> one<00:03:06.010> up<00:03:06.990> alright<00:03:07.990> so<00:03:08.230> we<00:03:08.440> went<00:03:08.530> ahead<00:03:08.650> and

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:31.740 
alright so one thing that I also want to
mention<00:04:28.690> about<00:04:28.870> this<00:04:29.139> is<00:04:29.440> the<00:04:30.509> the<00:04:31.509> bolt

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:31.750 
mention about this is the the bolt

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:33.420 
mention about this is the the bolt
actually<00:04:32.169> locks<00:04:32.410> back<00:04:32.620> to<00:04:32.740> the<00:04:32.830> rear<00:04:33.009> which<00:04:33.280> I

00:04:33.420 --> 00:04:33.430 
actually locks back to the rear which I

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:34.920 
actually locks back to the rear which I
find<00:04:33.610> to<00:04:33.729> be<00:04:33.820> incredibly<00:04:34.210> convenient<00:04:34.600> when

00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:34.930 
find to be incredibly convenient when

00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:36.510 
find to be incredibly convenient when
adjusting<00:04:35.410> the<00:04:35.470> hop-up<00:04:35.770> not<00:04:36.130> having<00:04:36.370> to<00:04:36.430> go

00:04:36.510 --> 00:04:36.520 
adjusting the hop-up not having to go

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:38.730 
adjusting the hop-up not having to go
back<00:04:36.550> and<00:04:36.820> forth<00:04:37.150> reopening<00:04:37.840> it<00:04:37.990> up<00:04:38.169> and<00:04:38.410> back

00:04:38.730 --> 00:04:38.740 
back and forth reopening it up and back

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:44.249 
back and forth reopening it up and back
and<00:04:39.300> just<00:04:40.300> being<00:04:40.919> very<00:04:41.919> very<00:04:42.600> annoying<00:04:43.600> so<00:04:44.110> it
