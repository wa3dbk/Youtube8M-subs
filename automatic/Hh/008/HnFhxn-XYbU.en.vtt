back<00:01:42.880> in<00:01:43.150> here<00:01:43.360> from<00:01:43.479> the<00:01:43.630> jug<00:01:43.870> this<00:01:44.530> is<00:01:44.740> lifted

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:45.130 
back in here from the jug this is lifted

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:47.580 
back in here from the jug this is lifted
off<00:01:45.220> of<00:01:45.460> its<00:01:45.640> seat<00:01:45.970> by<00:01:46.840> the<00:01:46.870> pressure<00:01:47.260> that's

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:47.590 
off of its seat by the pressure that's

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:49.320 
off of its seat by the pressure that's
in<00:01:47.740> the<00:01:47.830> radiator<00:01:48.220> this<00:01:48.550> is<00:01:48.700> notice<00:01:48.850> is<00:01:49.060> rated

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:49.330 
in the radiator this is notice is rated

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:51.719 
in the radiator this is notice is rated
at<00:01:49.420> 16<00:01:49.780> pounds<00:01:50.200> and<00:01:50.350> it<00:01:50.770> pushes<00:01:51.010> the<00:01:51.250> coolant

00:01:51.719 --> 00:01:51.729 
at 16 pounds and it pushes the coolant

00:01:51.729 --> 00:01:54.480 
at 16 pounds and it pushes the coolant
into<00:01:52.570> this<00:01:52.690> tank<00:01:53.040> alright<00:01:54.040> whenever<00:01:54.340> it

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:54.490 
into this tank alright whenever it

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:56.040 
into this tank alright whenever it
pleases<00:01:54.550> the<00:01:54.820> cool<00:01:55.030> into<00:01:55.270> that<00:01:55.420> tank<00:01:55.660> you<00:01:55.869> see

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:56.050 
pleases the cool into that tank you see

00:01:56.050 --> 00:01:59.969 
pleases the cool into that tank you see
it<00:01:56.170> is<00:01:56.290> here<00:01:56.560> and<00:01:57.160> the<00:01:58.000> coolant<00:01:58.979> contracts

00:01:59.969 --> 00:01:59.979 
it is here and the coolant contracts

00:01:59.979 --> 00:02:02.460 
it is here and the coolant contracts
after<00:02:00.520> it<00:02:00.850> cools<00:02:01.030> off<00:02:01.270> and<00:02:01.990> whatever<00:02:02.229> will

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:02.470 
after it cools off and whatever will

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:04.350 
after it cools off and whatever will
push<00:02:02.650> into<00:02:02.860> the<00:02:02.920> tank<00:02:03.250> it<00:02:03.670> can<00:02:03.729> pull<00:02:04.180> this

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:04.360 
push into the tank it can pull this

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:06.150 
push into the tank it can pull this
little<00:02:04.690> valve<00:02:04.900> open<00:02:05.290> and<00:02:05.380> drink<00:02:05.650> it<00:02:05.770> back<00:02:05.950> out

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:06.160 
little valve open and drink it back out

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:07.469 
little valve open and drink it back out
of<00:02:06.310> there<00:02:06.430> that's<00:02:06.729> why<00:02:06.940> this<00:02:07.000> little<00:02:07.240> valve

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:07.479 
of there that's why this little valve

00:02:07.479 --> 00:02:09.090 
of there that's why this little valve
doesn't<00:02:07.899> need<00:02:08.020> to<00:02:08.080> be<00:02:08.229> dangling<00:02:08.649> and<00:02:08.830> swinging

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:09.100 
doesn't need to be dangling and swinging

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:10.979 
doesn't need to be dangling and swinging
and<00:02:09.310> all<00:02:09.429> that<00:02:09.640> stuff<00:02:09.880> and<00:02:10.450> that's<00:02:10.600> a<00:02:10.780> brand

new<00:02:11.110> cap<00:02:11.350> right<00:02:11.560> there<00:02:11.670> now<00:02:12.670> this<00:02:12.820> one<00:02:13.000> right

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:13.090 
new cap right there now this one right

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:15.150 
new cap right there now this one right
here<00:02:13.390> like<00:02:13.870> I<00:02:13.959> said<00:02:13.989> only<00:02:14.380> place<00:02:14.800> it's<00:02:15.010> going

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:15.160 
here like I said only place it's going

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:18.270 
here like I said only place it's going
to<00:02:15.250> get<00:02:15.400> any<00:02:15.610> seal<00:02:15.940> is<00:02:16.900> around<00:02:17.290> the<00:02:17.440> top<00:02:17.680> so

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:18.280 
to get any seal is around the top so

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:19.680 
to get any seal is around the top so
it's<00:02:18.430> going<00:02:18.580> to<00:02:18.670> let<00:02:18.760> everything<00:02:19.030> come<00:02:19.360> and<00:02:19.570> go

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:19.690 
it's going to let everything come and go

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:21.540 
it's going to let everything come and go
as<00:02:19.840> it<00:02:19.989> wants<00:02:20.290> to<00:02:20.410> now<00:02:20.590> this<00:02:20.709> is<00:02:20.770> a<00:02:20.890> tool<00:02:21.220> there

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:21.550 
as it wants to now this is a tool there

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:23.580 
as it wants to now this is a tool there
are<00:02:21.610> no<00:02:21.820> leaves<00:02:22.030> that<00:02:22.209> are<00:02:22.270> permanently<00:02:22.810> but

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:23.590 
are no leaves that are permanently but

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:25.620 
are no leaves that are permanently but
it<00:02:23.739> is<00:02:23.860> going<00:02:24.100> to<00:02:24.190> enable<00:02:24.580> us<00:02:24.730> to<00:02:24.760> make<00:02:25.570> sure

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:25.630 
it is going to enable us to make sure

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:28.440 
it is going to enable us to make sure
that<00:02:26.019> the<00:02:26.200> cooling<00:02:26.590> system<00:02:27.010> is<00:02:27.160> full<00:02:27.430> we<00:02:28.209> got

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:28.450 
that the cooling system is full we got

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:30.000 
that the cooling system is full we got
to<00:02:28.600> pay<00:02:28.780> attention<00:02:28.810> to<00:02:29.260> what's<00:02:29.530> in<00:02:29.680> here

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:30.010 
to pay attention to what's in here

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:32.190 
to pay attention to what's in here
because<00:02:30.760> it's<00:02:31.090> going<00:02:31.239> to<00:02:31.330> be<00:02:31.450> using<00:02:31.900> it's

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:32.200 
because it's going to be using it's

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:33.570 
because it's going to be using it's
going<00:02:32.410> to<00:02:32.470> be<00:02:32.530> pushing<00:02:32.769> air<00:02:33.070> in<00:02:33.250> here<00:02:33.430> this

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:33.580 
going to be pushing air in here this

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:34.979 
going to be pushing air in here this
when<00:02:33.760> we<00:02:33.820> drinking<00:02:34.180> cooling<00:02:34.480> back<00:02:34.660> out<00:02:34.840> of

00:02:34.979 --> 00:02:34.989 
when we drinking cooling back out of

00:02:34.989 --> 00:02:35.280 
when we drinking cooling back out of
here

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:35.290 
here

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:37.470 
here
alright<00:02:36.220> so<00:02:36.400> we'll<00:02:36.549> put<00:02:36.700> that<00:02:36.730> on<00:02:36.970> there<00:02:37.150> just

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:37.480 
alright so we'll put that on there just

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:40.350 
alright so we'll put that on there just
like<00:02:37.920> the<00:02:38.920> regular<00:02:39.100> radiator<00:02:39.730> cap<00:02:39.970> would<00:02:40.150> go

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:40.360 
like the regular radiator cap would go

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:42.300 
like the regular radiator cap would go
and<00:02:40.870> like<00:02:41.080> say<00:02:41.290> the<00:02:41.350> only<00:02:41.560> place<00:02:41.739> it's<00:02:41.950> sealing

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:42.310 
and like say the only place it's sealing

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:44.130 
and like say the only place it's sealing
is<00:02:42.430> around<00:02:42.670> the<00:02:42.820> top<00:02:43.030> so<00:02:43.480> it'll<00:02:43.600> have<00:02:43.780> a<00:02:43.810> free

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:44.140 
is around the top so it'll have a free

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:46.430 
is around the top so it'll have a free
flow<00:02:44.440> through<00:02:45.280> this<00:02:45.430> little<00:02:45.670> surge

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:46.440 
flow through this little surge

00:02:46.440 --> 00:03:11.550 
flow through this little surge
we'll<00:02:47.440> start<00:02:47.770> it<00:02:47.920> up

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:11.560 

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:14.010 

her<00:03:12.070> belt<00:03:12.340> is<00:03:12.580> no<00:03:12.760> longer<00:03:13.000> squeaking<00:03:13.660> it<00:03:13.840> was

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:14.020 
her belt is no longer squeaking it was

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:15.540 
her belt is no longer squeaking it was
earlier<00:03:14.470> but<00:03:14.680> it's<00:03:14.890> not<00:03:15.070> now

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:15.550 
earlier but it's not now

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:24.600 
earlier but it's not now
and<00:03:16.330> he<00:03:16.420> also<00:03:16.600> meant<00:03:17.050> noticed<00:03:17.380> it

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:24.610 

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:27.090 

pretty<00:03:25.510> well<00:03:25.690> lined<00:03:25.900> up<00:03:26.200> it's<00:03:26.590> not<00:03:26.800> out<00:03:27.070> of

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:27.100 
pretty well lined up it's not out of

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:29.070 
pretty well lined up it's not out of
line<00:03:27.310> like<00:03:27.580> I'm<00:03:28.030> still<00:03:28.240> seeing<00:03:28.510> a<00:03:28.690> little<00:03:28.960> bit

00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:29.080 
line like I'm still seeing a little bit

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:31.470 
line like I'm still seeing a little bit
of<00:03:29.200> a<00:03:29.340> deflection<00:03:30.340> there<00:03:30.760> who<00:03:30.910> doesn't<00:03:31.120> like

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:31.480 
of a deflection there who doesn't like

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:33.690 
of a deflection there who doesn't like
that<00:03:31.780> and<00:03:32.650> then<00:03:32.890> you<00:03:32.950> rate<00:03:33.100> they<00:03:33.250> gave<00:03:33.430> us<00:03:33.580> a

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:33.700 
that and then you rate they gave us a

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:36.949 
that and then you rate they gave us a
free<00:03:33.940> tensioner

00:03:36.949 --> 00:03:36.959 

00:03:36.959 --> 00:03:38.839 

I'm<00:03:37.409> not<00:03:37.620> sure<00:03:37.799> I<00:03:37.829> like<00:03:38.040> the<00:03:38.189> quality<00:03:38.609> of<00:03:38.730> that

00:03:38.839 --> 00:03:38.849 
I'm not sure I like the quality of that

00:03:38.849 --> 00:03:40.880 
I'm not sure I like the quality of that
one<00:03:39.030> either<00:03:39.150> I'm<00:03:40.019> not<00:03:40.200> going<00:03:40.349> to<00:03:40.439> say<00:03:40.590> what<00:03:40.769> the

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:44.040 
brand name is these tensioners right

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:45.600 
brand name is these tensioners right
here<00:03:44.189> have

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:45.610 
here have

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:49.860

anyway so now we're going to let this

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:51.780 
anyway so now we're going to let this
warm<00:03:50.170> up<00:03:50.350> a<00:03:50.470> while<00:03:50.680> we<00:03:51.280> got<00:03:51.460> to<00:03:51.610> pay<00:03:51.760> attention

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:54.600 
warm up a while we got to pay attention
to<00:03:52.330> this<00:03:52.450> bottle<00:03:52.870> here<00:03:53.050> keep<00:03:53.380> it<00:03:53.590> full<00:03:53.860> but

00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:54.610 
to this bottle here keep it full but

00:03:54.610 --> 00:03:56.460 
to this bottle here keep it full but
whenever<00:03:54.850> the<00:03:55.270> coolant<00:03:55.720> starts<00:03:56.020> going<00:03:56.260> back

00:03:56.460 --> 00:03:56.470 
whenever the coolant starts going back

00:03:56.470 --> 00:03:58.500 
whenever the coolant starts going back
and<00:03:56.710> forth<00:03:56.950> as<00:03:57.160> the<00:03:57.340> fin<00:03:57.580> kicks<00:03:57.910> off<00:03:58.120> the<00:03:58.300> noon

00:03:58.500 --> 00:03:58.510 
and forth as the fin kicks off the noon

00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:01.500 
and forth as the fin kicks off the noon
the<00:03:58.960> thermostats<00:03:59.680> open<00:04:00.130> and<00:04:00.610> we'll<00:04:01.240> know<00:04:01.480> that

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:01.510 
the thermostats open and we'll know that

00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:03.870 
the thermostats open and we'll know that
we're<00:04:01.870> full<00:04:02.080> of<00:04:02.200> coolant<00:04:02.530> and<00:04:03.250> all<00:04:03.400> we<00:04:03.550> have<00:04:03.730> to

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:03.880 
we're full of coolant and all we have to

00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:06.750 
we're full of coolant and all we have to
do<00:04:04.060> is<00:04:04.330> take<00:04:04.540> this<00:04:04.720> cap<00:04:05.050> back<00:04:05.350> off<00:04:05.620> and<00:04:06.460> make

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:06.760 
do is take this cap back off and make

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:08.070 
do is take this cap back off and make
sure<00:04:06.970> it's<00:04:07.120> full<00:04:07.300> now<00:04:07.450> the<00:04:07.510> cool<00:04:07.840> thing<00:04:08.050> about

00:04:08.070 --> 00:04:08.080 
sure it's full now the cool thing about

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:09.540 
sure it's full now the cool thing about
that<00:04:08.470> is<00:04:08.650> since<00:04:08.920> there's<00:04:09.100> no<00:04:09.250> pressure

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:09.550 
that is since there's no pressure

00:04:09.550 --> 00:04:11.520 
that is since there's no pressure
buildup<00:04:10.150> in<00:04:10.330> there<00:04:10.510> with<00:04:10.660> this<00:04:10.810> cap<00:04:11.050> on<00:04:11.290> there

00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:11.530 
buildup in there with this cap on there

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:14.730 
buildup in there with this cap on there
and<00:04:12.340> when<00:04:13.210> you<00:04:13.300> take<00:04:13.510> one<00:04:13.720> of<00:04:13.840> these<00:04:13.930> off<00:04:14.260> and

00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:14.740 
and when you take one of these off and

00:04:14.740 --> 00:04:16.470 
and when you take one of these off and
you're<00:04:14.950> not<00:04:15.130> sure<00:04:15.160> about<00:04:15.580> what's<00:04:15.910> going<00:04:16.209> on

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:16.480 
you're not sure about what's going on

00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:18.930 
you're not sure about what's going on
it<00:04:16.630> pushes<00:04:16.989> cooling<00:04:17.980> out<00:04:18.130> makes<00:04:18.430> a<00:04:18.549> big<00:04:18.700> mess

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:18.940 
it pushes cooling out makes a big mess

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:20.009 
it pushes cooling out makes a big mess
and<00:04:19.180> sometimes<00:04:19.540> you<00:04:19.720> know<00:04:19.780> if<00:04:19.870> you're<00:04:19.959> not

00:04:20.009 --> 00:04:20.019

00:06:16.680 --> 00:06:16.690 
got two 12 showing on the computer over

00:06:16.690 --> 00:06:20.700 
got two 12 showing on the computer over
there<00:06:17.760> we've<00:06:18.760> got<00:06:18.870> good<00:06:19.870> coolant<00:06:20.350> level<00:06:20.620> in

00:07:03.500 --> 00:07:04.950 
getting murdered our coolant level is
right<00:07:03.680> where<00:07:03.889> it's<00:07:04.039> supposed<00:07:04.070> to<00:07:04.430> be

00:07:11.260 --> 00:07:11.270 
it on there and we let it start building

00:07:11.270 --> 00:07:14.260 
it on there and we let it start building
pressure<00:07:11.479> down<00:07:11.810> and<00:07:11.990> it's<00:07:12.199> good<00:07:12.440> to<00:07:12.560> go<00:07:13.270> so

00:07:14.260 --> 00:07:14.270 
pressure down and it's good to go so

00:07:14.270 --> 00:07:16.900 
pressure down and it's good to go so
that's<00:07:14.479> how<00:07:14.690> if<00:07:15.560> we<00:07:15.620> ordinary<00:07:16.430> if<00:07:16.610> you<00:07:16.699> do<00:07:16.820> it

before so that's how I use the
homemade<00:07:25.930> tool<00:07:26.850> radiator<00:07:27.850> cap<00:07:28.560> to<00:07:29.560> make<00:07:30.400> it

00:07:30.540 --> 00:07:30.550 
homemade tool radiator cap to make it

00:07:30.550 --> 00:07:34.770 
homemade tool radiator cap to make it
easier<00:07:30.880> to<00:07:31.180> please<00:07:32.110> because<00:07:32.320> it
