00:04:18.490 --> 00:04:18.500 
this is actually one continuous piece so

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:22.660 
this is actually one continuous piece so
this<00:04:18.709> literally<00:04:19.100> flips<00:04:19.580> down<00:04:21.340> so<00:04:22.340> that<00:04:22.490> your

00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:22.670 
this literally flips down so that your

this literally flips down so that your
carbides<00:04:23.060> don't<00:04:23.510> get<00:04:23.690> caught<00:04:24.110> on<00:04:24.380> this<00:04:24.890> edge

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:25.130 
carbides don't get caught on this edge

00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:26.830 
carbides don't get caught on this edge
at<00:04:25.460> all<00:04:25.550> so<00:04:25.790> you're<00:04:25.910> not<00:04:26.000> ripping<00:04:26.360> up<00:04:26.630> any

00:04:49.810 --> 00:04:52.570 
pretty cold so what we've done up here
this<00:04:50.810> black<00:04:51.170> fabric<00:04:51.530> that<00:04:51.980> you<00:04:52.130> see<00:04:52.340> all

00:04:52.570 --> 00:04:52.580 
this black fabric that you see all

00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:53.920 
this black fabric that you see all
around<00:04:53.000> these<00:04:53.270> are<00:04:53.420> actually<00:04:53.690> moving

00:04:53.920 --> 00:04:53.930 
around these are actually moving

00:04:53.930 --> 00:04:55.570 
around these are actually moving
blankets<00:04:54.560> that<00:04:54.650> people<00:04:55.010> use<00:04:55.190> to<00:04:55.430> move

00:04:55.570 --> 00:04:55.580 
blankets that people use to move

00:04:55.580 --> 00:04:57.850 
blankets that people use to move
furniture<00:04:56.330> or<00:04:56.810> pianos<00:04:57.230> things<00:04:57.500> like<00:04:57.680> that

00:04:57.850 --> 00:04:57.860 
furniture or pianos things like that

00:04:57.860 --> 00:04:59.860 
furniture or pianos things like that
this<00:04:58.400> is<00:04:58.610> creating<00:04:58.940> an<00:04:59.060> insulation<00:04:59.690> barrier

00:04:59.860 --> 00:04:59.870 
this is creating an insulation barrier

00:04:59.870 --> 00:05:04.480 
this is creating an insulation barrier
to<00:05:00.290> keep<00:05:00.500> heat<00:05:00.800> in<00:05:01.030> so<00:05:02.170> the<00:05:03.170> ceiling<00:05:03.590> we<00:05:04.310> had

00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:04.490 
to keep heat in so the ceiling we had

00:05:04.490 --> 00:05:07.120 
to keep heat in so the ceiling we had
some<00:05:04.730> extra<00:05:05.030> insulation<00:05:05.630> sheets<00:05:06.260> from<00:05:06.890> when

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:07.130 
some extra insulation sheets from when

00:05:07.130 --> 00:05:10.210 
some extra insulation sheets from when
we<00:05:07.340> were<00:05:07.520> building<00:05:07.880> the<00:05:08.120> house<00:05:08.300> so<00:05:09.050> draw<00:05:09.590> cut

00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:10.220 
we were building the house so draw cut

00:05:10.220 --> 00:05:13.030 
we were building the house so draw cut
all<00:05:10.460> of<00:05:10.610> these<00:05:10.760> pieces<00:05:11.060> and<00:05:11.570> then<00:05:11.990> lined<00:05:12.530> this

00:05:13.030 --> 00:05:13.040 
all of these pieces and then lined this

00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:16.360 
all of these pieces and then lined this
section<00:05:13.610> of<00:05:13.820> the<00:05:14.660> trailer<00:05:15.230> with<00:05:15.440> us<00:05:15.650> so<00:05:16.190> we're

00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:16.370 
section of the trailer with us so we're

00:05:16.370 --> 00:05:18.250 
section of the trailer with us so we're
not<00:05:16.400> losing<00:05:16.670> as<00:05:16.970> much<00:05:17.000> heat<00:05:17.390> out<00:05:17.540> the<00:05:17.870> top<00:05:18.110> of

00:05:18.250 --> 00:05:18.260 
not losing as much heat out the top of

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:21.160 
not losing as much heat out the top of
the<00:05:18.350> trailer<00:05:18.740> and<00:05:18.920> then<00:05:19.640> this<00:05:20.630> middle<00:05:20.870> portion

00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:21.170 
the trailer and then this middle portion

00:05:21.170 --> 00:05:22.840 
the trailer and then this middle portion
here<00:05:21.590> actually<00:05:21.860> there's<00:05:22.190> a<00:05:22.250> curtain<00:05:22.640> that<00:05:22.730> we

00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:22.850 
here actually there's a curtain that we

00:05:22.850 --> 00:05:26.440 
here actually there's a curtain that we
can<00:05:23.000> actually<00:05:23.090> close<00:05:23.690> off<00:05:24.110> this<00:05:25.030> section<00:05:26.030> here

00:05:26.440 --> 00:05:26.450 
can actually close off this section here

00:05:26.450 --> 00:05:29.200 
can actually close off this section here
in<00:05:26.630> the<00:05:26.750> front<00:05:27.160> we<00:05:28.160> got<00:05:28.310> that<00:05:28.520> one<00:05:28.760> foot<00:05:28.970> view

00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:29.210 
in the front we got that one foot view

00:05:29.210 --> 00:05:31.030 
in the front we got that one foot view
like<00:05:29.480> I<00:05:29.630> mentioned<00:05:30.050> before<00:05:30.080> with<00:05:30.650> the<00:05:30.800> shelf

00:05:31.030 --> 00:05:31.040 
like I mentioned before with the shelf

00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:32.680 
like I mentioned before with the shelf
on<00:05:31.160> top<00:05:31.430> of<00:05:31.640> it<00:05:31.760> so<00:05:31.880> they<00:05:31.970> can<00:05:32.000> put<00:05:32.330> our<00:05:32.450> tools

00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:32.690 
on top of it so they can put our tools

00:05:32.690 --> 00:05:35.320 
on top of it so they can put our tools
up<00:05:32.960> here<00:05:32.990> we<00:05:33.260> can<00:05:33.320> put<00:05:33.560> a<00:05:33.590> gear<00:05:33.920> up<00:05:34.070> here<00:05:34.370> and

00:06:18.250 --> 00:06:18.260 
so you're really keeping the heat in so

00:06:18.260 --> 00:06:20.070 
so you're really keeping the heat in so
Joel<00:06:18.440> also<00:06:18.590> purchased<00:06:19.070> a<00:06:19.160> generator

00:06:20.070 --> 00:06:20.080 
Joel also purchased a generator

00:06:20.080 --> 00:06:22.409 
Joel also purchased a generator
and<00:06:20.169> a<00:06:20.379> lot<00:06:20.590> of<00:06:20.620> trick<00:06:20.860> heater<00:06:21.129> that<00:06:21.520> we<00:06:22.270> can

00:06:22.409 --> 00:06:22.419 
and a lot of trick heater that we can

00:06:22.419 --> 00:06:25.679 
and a lot of trick heater that we can
easily<00:06:22.569> plug<00:06:22.990> in<00:06:23.229> and<00:06:23.530> set<00:06:24.340> in<00:06:24.550> here<00:06:24.909> and<00:06:25.120> it

00:06:25.679 --> 00:06:25.689 
easily plug in and set in here and it

00:06:25.689 --> 00:06:28.589 
easily plug in and set in here and it
actually<00:06:25.870> gets<00:06:26.139> pretty<00:06:26.500> toasty<00:06:27.129> in<00:06:27.250> here<00:06:27.599> so

00:06:28.589 --> 00:06:28.599 
actually gets pretty toasty in here so

00:06:28.599 --> 00:06:30.510 
actually gets pretty toasty in here so
this<00:06:28.689> is<00:06:28.870> really<00:06:29.289> gonna<00:06:29.439> help<00:06:29.740> us<00:06:29.949> when<00:06:30.370> we're
