00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:17.689
 and that's what chivas is for, I think we have 

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:20.210
 to continue on this good path 

00:00:17.689 --> 00:00:22.430
 relax and obviously seek to be what 

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:24.710
 taller than you can worry about how 

00:00:22.430 --> 00:00:26.930
 we have done it during the tournament 

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:29.540
 us for doing things well for 

00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:31.910
 keep this same line and therefore not 

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:33.680
 lower my arms I think we've seen a 

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:36.140
 boy is getting better looser more 

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:39.950
 compact in the three lines I think that 

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:41.540
 very complete and that is what we are 

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:44.059
 hanging the coaching staff I think not 

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:47.300
 there is no need to move forward to live 

00:00:44.059 --> 00:00:49.010
 present and be in day to day and it is 

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:51.499
 step by step we know that we can 

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:53.149
 achieve that and with that same form of 

00:00:51.499 --> 00:00:56.600
 think about the percentage part we are 

00:00:53.149 --> 00:00:58.069
 he is still wanting to add wanting 

00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:00.469
 win the games just for that 

00:00:58.069 --> 00:01:03.469
 for that cause and good in parallel it 

00:01:00.469 --> 00:01:05.059
 gives the part to focus on the group 

00:01:03.469 --> 00:01:08.210
 and focus on other things but we have the 

00:01:05.059 --> 00:01:09.770
 first priority of permanence a 

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:11.780
 party that leads 20 is not easy 

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:14.060
 they also bring a situation the 

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:16.100
 inertia that would like to reverse the but 

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:19.430
 our approach is good for strengthening 

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:20.150
 this stadium is this house and win 

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:22.760
 all the games 

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:24.620
 that convictions can be if 

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:25.910
 win but well we know there is a 

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:27.500
 rival in front who will also look 

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:29.120
 look to yours and we'll go 

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:32.660
 crumbling the match over on the 

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:34.370
 March that pleased not grateful with a 

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:37.190
 day that a family with a few 

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:38.990
 teammates with the club and with 

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:41.630
 the people of selections not so much minor 

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:44.090
 as how is the greatest and the age that very 

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:45.680
 excited very happy and to continue 

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:47.540
 working not to continue 

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:49.700
 harvesting things in the future the truth 

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:51.340
 that we are close I mentioned it from the 

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:54.680
 principle not the team was coming up 

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:57.140
 and I think that winning on Sunday that's not 

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:59.270
 is already heading to think about other things not 

00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:01.490
 be more focused on what comes next 

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:03.080
 liguilla and we know that we have a 

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:05.540
 close tournament strong not against 

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:07.700
 teams that are also fighting there 

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:09.860
 the upper parts of the table 

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:12.970
 So that good one is still a good 

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:12.970
 parameter for us
