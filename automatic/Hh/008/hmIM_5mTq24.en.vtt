00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:08.710
 Look everybody did this is the first 

00:00:05.560 --> 00:00:11.139
 hits show the video and we decided not 

00:00:08.710 --> 00:00:12.910
 start with the gameplay because it is 

00:00:11.139 --> 00:00:14.469
 very shaken and rpc agent 

00:00:12.910 --> 00:00:16.090
 We'll actually make a deal. 

00:00:14.469 --> 00:00:19.690
 a little bit different 

00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:22.510
 today is the demo of the devil may cry odense 

00:00:19.690 --> 00:00:25.810
 which is a reboot of the series nÃ© 

00:00:22.510 --> 00:00:28.930
 and I found him third, I played it 

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:31.990
 there for a while and came here to tell 

00:00:28.930 --> 00:00:34.120
 that I found of the flight so you go 

00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:35.980
 I do not know 

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:38.589
 as I said before is a reboot of the series 

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:41.140
 the devil may cry and the demo game on 

00:00:38.589 --> 00:00:44.769
 Truth it starts with some warnings 

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:47.559
 saying he has alcohol and violence 

00:00:44.769 --> 00:00:49.510
 Damn it and start with dante by dell 

00:00:47.559 --> 00:00:52.179
 appeared in front of a woman 

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:55.089
 the desire of many to follow her and the world 

00:00:52.179 --> 00:00:56.890
 will try to stop the game from doing so 

00:00:55.089 --> 00:00:59.739
 continued the same despite the fact 

00:00:56.890 --> 00:01:02.620
 change in character remains 

00:00:59.739 --> 00:01:05.680
 Lech rules with focus on action a good 

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:07.540
 genetics than the normal ones can 

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:10.719
 attack the sword that in fact of a 

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:12.850
 sickle and with the dante's pistol and do 

00:01:10.719 --> 00:01:15.340
 combos with them have a system of 

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:18.640
 on-screen composition that is growing 

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:19.390
 giving demonstrations that will win until sss a 

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:23.350
 thing like that 

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:29.860
 I did not get to ps because I'm so good 

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:32.409
 so it's not totally legal 

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:36.329
 he is not so frenetic I expected 

00:01:32.409 --> 00:01:36.329
 how much the demos have appeared 

00:01:36.399 --> 00:01:42.909
 he is not so frantic so he inspires 

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:44.950
 that thing so look at the sky that the game 

00:01:42.909 --> 00:01:46.030
 such as metal gear 

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:48.640
 solid rising 

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:50.859
 but it's pretty good actually if you compare 

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:52.060
 with games and have already left for example as 

00:01:50.859 --> 00:01:55.719
 and iron 

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:59.740
 the god of war or their parents that 

00:01:55.719 --> 00:02:02.890
 They went to xbox and playstation 2 and 3 right. 

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:04.499
 he should not be in the area well and not enough 

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:07.299
 to be smaller than some of them inclusive 

00:02:04.499 --> 00:02:10.390
 the values that have to use scythe to 

00:02:07.299 --> 00:02:13.180
 kill and even the sickle makes a has a 

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:15.800
 central role in the skill can use 

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:18.620
 her household platforms 

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:20.630
 there are four different forms the game 

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:22.910
 also has some action scenes like this. 

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:25.040
 the platform itself has to 

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:27.620
 run jump from one place to another 

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:29.750
 this is the gameplay has disrupted a 

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:32.900
 I do not know if it seemed that at 

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:35.840
 times command did not go for example dante 

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:37.730
 has a command that uses it flies there and 

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:39.470
 in some times plays will fall in 

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:41.780
 holes because he did not run through 

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:44.570
 control of the game was not penalized 

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:47.900
 so he got lucky and put a 

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:49.700
 cat so far is your slutty 

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:51.710
 lose points because of the lack of 

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:55.280
 feasibility of program 5 breaks down 

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:57.140
 little in 2011 more graphics and sound the 

00:02:55.280 --> 00:03:00.350
 spending goes so well despite the fact that 

00:02:57.140 --> 00:03:02.960
 some parts look like half-assembled 

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:05.330
 in blocks so the scenario block with the 

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:06.380
 Car block has a tapped that 

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:09.920
 it seems that he lacked a little whim 

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:11.330
 For sound of the game is good it does not reach 

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:14.030
 be anything sensational so at least 

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:14.990
 not who has been a voice actor of 

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:17.120
 The characters' personalities are 

00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:18.920
 also interesting because although the 

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:21.110
 ill have become a teenager 

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:22.430
 he keeps saying funk a good focus is 

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:24.320
 the kind things 

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:26.690
 time is short indeed a game of 

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:30.020
 rewards for the speed that completes the 

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:31.850
 things then for some player who 

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:34.070
 involves two or three times for this 

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:35.989
 ending one in ten 15 minutes 

00:03:34.070 --> 00:03:38.120
 I took 30 minutes because I stayed 

00:03:35.989 --> 00:03:39.530
 exploring the main and yet I 

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:42.200
 I found several items in the main menu 

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:44.060
 of the demo has a mode that faces a 

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:47.390
 boss who actually looks like a caterpillar 

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:48.530
 The boss's fight was quite normal like that. 

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:50.630
 of such games 

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:52.700
 I hit him down from below and hit him 

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:56.420
 until he opened a place where he could 

00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:58.130
 to really score like that is something that 

00:03:56.420 --> 00:04:00.830
 I thought it was cool that way was that everything 

00:03:58.130 --> 00:04:04.310
 you can alternating platforms with a 

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:06.590
 sickle during this ends up adding the 

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:09.130
 obesity since part of the dodo attack 

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:12.500
 boss has to understand this way 

00:04:09.130 --> 00:04:14.450
 repeated 15 years ago when the battle was 

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:17.330
 very interesting someone dying once 

00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:19.580
 no middle of it and I play the two 

00:04:17.330 --> 00:04:22.010
 example options can spend 1 and has to 

00:04:19.580 --> 00:04:23.810
 resume to continue participating or 

00:04:22.010 --> 00:04:25.520
 Can another start this ends? 

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:27.440
 influencing the final score 

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:28.610
 I was too lazy to start from 

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:31.610
 new then 

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:34.340
 I did it but nothing that a little bit of 

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:37.099
 training and such do not do for killing the boss 

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:39.439
 of the arm behind because when I realized 

00:04:37.099 --> 00:04:41.330
 who was for an attack more than half 

00:04:39.439 --> 00:04:43.310
 the deceased energy power last 

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:47.599
 Chef's stage symptom no attack 

00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:49.580
 with madson pacha actually and then 

00:04:47.599 --> 00:04:51.439
 I ended up playing fuck since it is 

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:54.199
 only the crowded always get stuck in 

00:04:51.439 --> 00:04:56.870
 paper but in any case there was not 

00:04:54.199 --> 00:04:59.360
 something that presents a great challenge so the 

00:04:56.870 --> 00:05:03.409
 terminal of one it ends up releasing modes 

00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:06.199
 on the ropes that father is during the case is 

00:05:03.409 --> 00:05:07.520
 to show that he has a son of the guy and is 

00:05:06.199 --> 00:05:10.129
 a more difficult way 

00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:12.500
 then who wants to play again and 

00:05:10.129 --> 00:05:16.819
 again again and again and again 20 and 

00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:18.740
 30 minutes of gameplay that has offers 

00:05:16.819 --> 00:05:19.939
 some more things like that but nothing 

00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:23.419
 grandiose 

00:05:19.939 --> 00:05:26.479
 the game comes out on January 15 he does 

00:05:23.419 --> 00:05:30.199
 he is very emphatic with this showing 

00:05:26.479 --> 00:05:31.759
 several times this screen and until then I do not know 

00:05:30.199 --> 00:05:35.120
 if there is any other of them anyway 

00:05:31.759 --> 00:05:38.180
 but the same for what gave for sale the 

00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:39.580
 demo the game looks very interesting is a 

00:05:38.180 --> 00:05:42.409
 the anticipated summer releases 

00:05:39.580 --> 00:05:45.409
 along with others like the subway itself 

00:05:42.409 --> 00:05:47.089
 what you have here then 10 6 3 and if 

00:05:45.409 --> 00:05:49.069
 Someone is afraid that this demo 

00:05:47.089 --> 00:05:51.860
 causes the impression that the president 

00:05:49.069 --> 00:05:53.029
 Are you or do not you have no problem? 

00:05:51.860 --> 00:05:54.979
 You need to worry about that. 

00:05:53.029 --> 00:05:56.360
 download because it is very interesting 

00:05:54.979 --> 00:06:00.939
 worth it 

00:05:56.360 --> 00:06:03.349
 and neither is that sadness that 

00:06:00.939 --> 00:06:07.009
 suffering that was playing and I know that you 

00:06:03.349 --> 00:06:08.810
 recommended is one of the games that 

00:06:07.009 --> 00:06:10.279
 can continue in the list I have to 

00:06:08.810 --> 00:06:13.009
 tell said brown 

00:06:10.279 --> 00:06:14.960
 Good, the video is what I expect. 

00:06:13.009 --> 00:06:17.180
 that you really liked the 

00:06:14.960 --> 00:06:19.520
 my first video practically then 

00:06:17.180 --> 00:06:21.830
 They do not hate me that much, and here I 

00:06:19.520 --> 00:06:23.870
 I'm recording first seen and 

00:06:21.830 --> 00:06:27.289
 I'm not such an eloquent person. 

00:06:23.870 --> 00:06:29.509
 still have to practice a little favorite 

00:06:27.289 --> 00:06:31.819
 and if you liked short on basses that 

00:06:29.509 --> 00:06:33.529
 the channel that whole thing and is always 

00:06:31.819 --> 00:06:34.490
 it rains everyday because every day we go 

00:06:33.529 --> 00:06:36.879
 has in soccer 

00:06:34.490 --> 00:06:36.879
 beauty
