00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:22.880 
deck over wood deck is we don't have to

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:24.190 
deck over wood deck is we don't have to
deal<00:02:23.030> with<00:02:23.060> splinters<00:02:23.569> and<00:02:23.780> we<00:02:23.840> don't<00:02:24.020> have<00:02:24.110> to

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:35.930 
cast-in-place concrete you can see we

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:38.770 
cast-in-place concrete you can see we

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:40.610 
it was cast so that it looks like wood

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:43.539 
it was cast so that it looks like wood
planks<00:02:41.030> and<00:02:41.180> it<00:02:41.269> looks<00:02:41.600> like<00:02:41.870> a<00:02:42.140> bridge<00:02:43.100> rather

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:46.630 
than just a stamped concrete pattern
it's<00:02:45.350> got<00:02:45.500> that<00:02:45.650> third<00:02:45.890> dimension<00:02:46.069> to<00:02:46.400> it

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:46.640 
it's got that third dimension to it

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:49.420 
it's got that third dimension to it
makes<00:02:47.150> it<00:02:47.269> nice<00:02:47.590> when<00:02:48.590> it<00:02:48.709> comes<00:02:48.890> to<00:02:49.040> stamped
