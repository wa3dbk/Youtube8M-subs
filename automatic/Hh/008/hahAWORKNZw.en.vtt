00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:31.250 
these razors are women's razors they

00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:34.180 
these razors are women's razors they
have<00:04:31.460> three<00:04:31.850> blades<00:04:32.320> usually<00:04:33.320> I<00:04:33.350> use<00:04:33.590> guy

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:34.190 
have three blades usually I use guy

00:04:34.190 --> 00:04:36.340 
have three blades usually I use guy
razors<00:04:34.760> because<00:04:35.180> they<00:04:35.360> have<00:04:35.540> four<00:04:35.840> blades<00:04:36.110> and

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:36.350 
razors because they have four blades and

00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:38.110 
razors because they have four blades and
they<00:04:36.440> really<00:04:36.860> get<00:04:37.040> down<00:04:37.340> to<00:04:37.400> the<00:04:37.760> root<00:04:37.910> of<00:04:38.000> the

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:38.120 
they really get down to the root of the

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:40.540 
they really get down to the root of the
hair<00:04:38.300> and<00:04:38.600> I<00:04:38.810> stay<00:04:39.260> like<00:04:39.530> smoother<00:04:40.250> for<00:04:40.490> longer

00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:40.550 
hair and I stay like smoother for longer

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:42.790 
hair and I stay like smoother for longer
but<00:04:41.420> I<00:04:41.450> decided<00:04:41.720> to<00:04:41.810> give<00:04:41.900> these<00:04:42.050> a<00:04:42.080> try<00:04:42.200> and

00:04:42.790 --> 00:04:42.800 
but I decided to give these a try and

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:44.260 
but I decided to give these a try and
these<00:04:42.980> are<00:04:43.040> all<00:04:43.250> right<00:04:43.430> I<00:04:43.610> like<00:04:43.790> them<00:04:44.030> you<00:04:44.150> know

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:44.270 
these are all right I like them you know

00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:46.330 
these are all right I like them you know
they<00:04:44.510> don't<00:04:44.720> last<00:04:44.930> too<00:04:45.290> long<00:04:45.320> but<00:04:45.860> it's<00:04:46.160> weird

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:46.340 
they don't last too long but it's weird

00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:47.800 
they don't last too long but it's weird
because<00:04:46.490> the<00:04:46.700> handles<00:04:47.060> have<00:04:47.210> sense<00:04:47.450> on<00:04:47.630> them

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:47.810 
because the handles have sense on them

00:04:47.810 --> 00:04:49.720 
because the handles have sense on them
and<00:04:47.930> they<00:04:48.050> smell<00:04:48.380> don't<00:04:49.010> ask<00:04:49.250> me<00:04:49.430> what<00:04:49.520> that's

00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:49.730 
and they smell don't ask me what that's

00:04:49.730 --> 00:04:51.640 
and they smell don't ask me what that's
for<00:04:50.000> but<00:04:50.300> I<00:04:50.540> guess<00:04:50.780> it<00:04:50.930> works<00:04:51.140> yeah<00:04:51.440> these<00:04:51.590> are

00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:51.650 
for but I guess it works yeah these are

00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:53.110
