00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:48.860 
yeah back to the infrared thing the
reason<00:03:47.520> I<00:03:47.580> bought<00:03:47.730> it<00:03:47.910> because<00:03:48.120> I<00:03:48.300> had<00:03:48.750> it

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:48.870 
reason I bought it because I had it

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:51.320 
reason I bought it because I had it
before<00:03:49.110> prestige<00:03:49.590> a<00:03:49.680> long<00:03:49.830> time<00:03:50.010> ago<00:03:50.130> but<00:03:51.120> the

00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:51.330 
before prestige a long time ago but the

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:54.320 
before prestige a long time ago but the
reason<00:03:51.480> I<00:03:51.660> didn't<00:03:52.970> well<00:03:53.970> I<00:03:54.000> was<00:03:54.240> actually

00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:54.330 
reason I didn't well I was actually

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:56.240 
reason I didn't well I was actually
gonna<00:03:54.510> buy<00:03:54.690> like<00:03:54.720> a<00:03:54.930> variable<00:03:55.770> zoom<00:03:55.890> but<00:03:56.160> it

00:03:56.240 --> 00:03:56.250 
gonna buy like a variable zoom but it

00:03:56.250 --> 00:03:57.680 
gonna buy like a variable zoom but it
was<00:03:56.370> two<00:03:56.520> thousand<00:03:56.940> dollars<00:03:57.210> and<00:03:57.420> I<00:03:57.570> was

00:03:57.680 --> 00:03:57.690 
was two thousand dollars and I was

00:03:57.690 --> 00:03:59.090 
was two thousand dollars and I was
saving<00:03:57.960> up<00:03:58.020> for<00:03:58.080> cod<00:03:58.350> points<00:03:58.680> history<00:03:58.950> eight

00:03:59.090 --> 00:03:59.100 
saving up for cod points history eight

00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:00.350 
saving up for cod points history eight
gold<00:03:59.280> guns<00:03:59.490> because<00:03:59.670> I<00:03:59.850> was<00:03:59.970> really<00:04:00.180> stingy

00:04:00.350 --> 00:04:00.360 
gold guns because I was really stingy

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:02.540 
gold guns because I was really stingy
before<00:04:00.780> I<00:04:00.810> got<00:04:00.990> my<00:04:01.080> gold<00:04:01.260> Olympia<00:04:01.650> and<00:04:01.890> my<00:04:02.340> gold

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:02.550 
before I got my gold Olympia and my gold

00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:05.240 
before I got my gold Olympia and my gold
commando<00:04:03.110> so<00:04:04.110> okay<00:04:04.590> I'll<00:04:04.740> just<00:04:04.770> by<00:04:04.980> infrared

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:05.250 
commando so okay I'll just by infrared

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:08.390 
commando so okay I'll just by infrared
because<00:04:05.760> it's<00:04:05.970> still<00:04:06.150> in<00:04:06.270> I<00:04:06.360> scope<00:04:06.720> and<00:04:07.400> it's

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:08.400 
because it's still in I scope and it's

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:10.580 
because it's still in I scope and it's
only<00:04:08.520> one<00:04:08.730> thousand<00:04:09.150> but<00:04:09.810> then<00:04:10.020> I<00:04:10.080> realized<00:04:10.410> it

00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:10.590 
only one thousand but then I realized it

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:12.080 
only one thousand but then I realized it
was<00:04:10.650> also<00:04:10.920> two<00:04:11.190> thousand<00:04:11.610> but<00:04:11.760> I<00:04:11.790> realized

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:12.090 
was also two thousand but I realized

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:13.699 
was also two thousand but I realized
after<00:04:12.330> i<00:04:12.540> bought<00:04:12.690> it<00:04:12.870> so<00:04:13.110> I<00:04:13.320> don't<00:04:13.470> really<00:04:13.560> care

00:04:13.699 --> 00:04:13.709 
after i bought it so I don't really care

00:04:13.709 --> 00:04:15.530 
after i bought it so I don't really care
though<00:04:13.860> infrared<00:04:14.700> plus<00:04:14.970> the<00:04:15.150> white

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:15.540 
though infrared plus the white

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:17.360 
though infrared plus the white
phosphorous<00:04:16.019> grenades<00:04:16.079> are<00:04:16.560> awesome<00:04:17.190> on

00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:17.370 
phosphorous grenades are awesome on

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:18.560 
phosphorous grenades are awesome on
hazard<00:04:17.730> because<00:04:17.880> you<00:04:18.060> toss<00:04:18.239> right<00:04:18.450> in<00:04:18.510> the

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:18.570 
hazard because you toss right in the

00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:20.640 
middle and they have no idea they're

00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:21.949 
middle and they have no idea they're
kind<00:04:21.030> of<00:04:21.060> wait<00:04:21.209> for<00:04:21.329> the<00:04:21.419> stuff<00:04:21.570> to<00:04:21.630> go<00:04:21.780> down

00:04:21.949 --> 00:04:21.959 
kind of wait for the stuff to go down

00:04:21.959 --> 00:04:23.270 
kind of wait for the stuff to go down
but<00:04:22.230> you<00:04:22.320> actually<00:04:22.440> see<00:04:22.680> exactly<00:04:22.950> where<00:04:23.160> they

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:23.280 
but you actually see exactly where they

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:26.120 
but you actually see exactly where they
are<00:04:23.360> it's<00:04:24.360> a<00:04:24.419> great<00:04:24.510> tactic<00:04:24.960> nerdy<00:04:25.770> hamburger

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:26.130
