00:00:15.949 --> 00:00:20.630
 First thing we could do on each one 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:22.740

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:08.430
 index work and well I have it 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:15.119

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:17.850
 now it should be okay then and see you soon 

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:22.439
 Here I am again and we start 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:28.070

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:31.460
 then that 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:41.750
 Let's see , that's all 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:49.020
 not really 

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:54.650
 I'll just take him a card 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:02:02.790
 much better and that's how we get it 

00:01:54.650 --> 00:02:04.619
 network or that he believes that weiler 

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:06.180
 Can i read down if the vaccine 

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:09.619
 I can play this here yet 

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:09.619
 so I can play this here 

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:16.709
 and then we can, for example, nova 

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:18.320
 because I do not have it now 

00:02:16.709 --> 00:02:20.720
 really a fusion degree on hand 

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:25.500
 that spoiled thrown 

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:29.000
 i, however, galaxy and photons and 

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:29.000
 plans glock 

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:31.780
 OK 

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:44.350
 I know what that laxey soldier is 

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:46.800
 do not save 

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:49.800
 you can a galaxy eyes your hand 

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:49.800
 OK 

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:56.000
 the good thing is we have that sincerely 

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:58.930
 Whoever attacks us can do that 

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.930
 also just throw it off 

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:09.160
 that is that is of course stupid 

00:03:09.569 --> 00:03:14.689
 or do I try it out easily 

00:03:22.069 --> 00:03:33.099
 achso so it goes okay well no matter there have 

00:03:29.209 --> 00:03:33.099
 I do not care now, I do not care 

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:42.269
 and now we should 

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:43.819
 works if that does not cancel 

00:03:42.269 --> 00:03:49.940
 can 

00:03:43.819 --> 00:03:49.940
 He has a warning that is stupid warning 

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:58.280
 then I just take that now 

00:04:03.209 --> 00:04:12.090
 and now we get two from 

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:12.090
 which only a 2 1 in the 2 why not 

00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:18.590
 and now we could do the game but me 

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:23.620
 I'm sure a warm beds 

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:23.620
 that's why I just pass nova 

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:33.050
 Yes 

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:33.050
 that's why 

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:43.670
 and let's go this is a machine and 

00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:46.270
 that's two more I like it 

00:04:43.670 --> 00:04:46.270
 just no idea 

00:04:48.910 --> 00:05:00.050
 let's not see ever 

00:04:56.630 --> 00:05:02.360
 bad that was the nice thing I did 

00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:07.160
 wanted to do because of nova then I have 

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:09.380
 no suspicions on the field yes me that 

00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:10.670
 just now, because the beautiful one 

00:05:09.380 --> 00:05:13.280
 Hanover is when it is canceled 

00:05:10.670 --> 00:05:18.260
 by serious warning gets end effect 

00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:20.350
 and conjure what that is what 

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:20.350
 beautiful 

00:05:20.710 --> 00:05:24.500
 ali k table to agree or 

00:05:23.090 --> 00:05:27.760
 I think that new one will come too 

00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:27.760
 and lighting i believe 

00:05:30.729 --> 00:05:43.110
 ok yes I was sorry that was 

00:05:39.189 --> 00:05:43.110
 what private I was disturbed 

00:05:45.629 --> 00:05:52.169
 I do not just believe in it or me 

00:05:48.610 --> 00:05:52.169
 could swear and make that out of there 

00:05:54.550 --> 00:05:59.639
 I can do that 

00:05:57.120 --> 00:06:03.180
 i just show that before i mean 

00:05:59.639 --> 00:06:07.370
 He would have to get up and do it 

00:06:03.180 --> 00:06:07.370
 just another club 

00:06:11.710 --> 00:06:18.980
 what are you doing now 

00:06:13.920 --> 00:06:18.980
 yes, but I believe that continues 

00:06:23.210 --> 00:06:33.000
 ok, it works so much better than 

00:06:26.460 --> 00:06:35.330
 before because my field does not see it 

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:35.330
 seems bad 

00:06:37.830 --> 00:06:44.040
 okay he attacks okay we should 

00:06:42.810 --> 00:06:46.280
 still have won the next 

00:06:44.040 --> 00:06:46.280
 round 

00:06:48.410 --> 00:06:54.750
 I could get that too 

00:06:51.380 --> 00:06:59.990
 yes why not cards are always 

00:06:54.750 --> 00:06:59.990
 good and that's good too 

00:07:00.650 --> 00:07:08.130
 So we can do something with it 

00:07:06.300 --> 00:07:09.570
 we can get away with it 

00:07:08.130 --> 00:07:15.470
 but i would go for you 

00:07:09.570 --> 00:07:15.470
 dear the core ok then 

00:07:17.129 --> 00:07:28.909
 that and get us that works now 

00:07:24.389 --> 00:07:30.809
 already we could we could 

00:07:28.909 --> 00:07:32.249
 I do not want it to be that bad 

00:07:30.809 --> 00:07:35.159
 then activates safety container 

00:07:32.249 --> 00:07:40.469
 I can use that for life 

00:07:35.159 --> 00:07:42.949
 I hope this is a cyber dragon 

00:07:40.469 --> 00:07:44.639

00:07:42.949 --> 00:07:46.219

00:07:44.639 --> 00:07:48.419

00:07:51.240 --> 00:07:57.019
 actually work better than that 

00:07:52.619 --> 00:07:57.019
