00:00:00.529 --> 00:00:04.049
 the person I am asking you to buy now we are only 17 years old 

00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:08.820

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:12.180
 but l strongly encourage ladies and gentlemen here is the cairo 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:27.039
 it really is I see that many adults 

00:00:27.039 --> 00:00:28.340
 many said it's cool 

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:29.130
 sc 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:34.050
 no really not what the trade and management of Canadians aged 17 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:34.399
 years 

00:00:34.399 --> 00:00:37.539
 and to say what really annoys me in France and that you adults 

00:00:37.539 --> 00:00:40.170
 it's really a very bad vision of us helping them seriously 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:41.520
 you see us as 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:45.059
 chassis remind you of this pub of the two masses of the idiot danone pub 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:47.020
 - fart mackay 

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:49.910
 a whore I feel really bad about my career 

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:52.400
 I think it's the stress of exams 

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:55.129
 ticketing swim strongly criticized too 

00:00:55.129 --> 00:00:58.670
 it's so true and pathetic things in the belly 

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:01.030
 it's pretty strange 

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:02.060
 frankly 

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:05.330
 if this news was made with real gifts it looks like that 

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:07.630
 would look more like st 

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:10.790
 at the bottom of the painting bourgoin is rare 

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:12.440

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:15.610
 how do we know 

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:18.370
 ten years 

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:21.460
 it is a legal dispute 

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:24.850
 satisfied 

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:26.620
 Frederic Laflamme Sicily 

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:29.609
 we have plenty of no problem you do not realize for example 

00:01:29.609 --> 00:01:31.060

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:34.110

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:36.090

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:49.750
 interrogation the surprise story 

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:52.750
 what can you tell us about Trotskyist 

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:57.250
 trotsky you know who you are talking 

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:05.560

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:06.890
 little sister 

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:09.299
 iran sunday morning 

00:02:09.299 --> 00:02:12.769
 that too is something that annoys you graham you adults 

00:02:12.769 --> 00:02:15.959
 the fact that we young people have a little down pants 

00:02:15.959 --> 00:02:17.819
 we signatories 

00:02:17.819 --> 00:02:21.079
 well you have a soul for his good run and the winners of the cup 

00:02:21.079 --> 00:02:22.379
 davis you say 

00:02:22.379 --> 00:02:25.519
 even in the worst case in his pants 

00:02:25.519 --> 00:02:28.799
 but it is no longer that of germany is rotten without messing up you do like 

00:02:28.799 --> 00:02:29.519
 it means 

00:02:29.519 --> 00:02:32.730
 it's normal that we help them a little down pants look 

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:35.289
 at the time 

00:02:35.289 --> 00:02:39.019
 it develops and the trunk during which m the elders evolved the 

00:02:39.019 --> 00:02:42.409
 40 years old arrived at the real is fined 

00:02:42.409 --> 00:02:44.619
 the 2000s at the waist 

00:02:44.619 --> 00:02:47.619
 normal than 2009 

00:02:48.129 --> 00:02:51.479
 and frankly it would not surprise me that in 2030 

00:02:51.479 --> 00:02:54.479
 we give ourselves like that guys 

00:02:59.849 --> 00:03:02.229
 no no no it ends like that but I'm not kidding 

00:03:02.229 --> 00:03:04.330
 believe that it's me too 

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:07.330
 as far as it may be more in 2030 

00:03:07.859 --> 00:03:09.059
 it's a serious 

00:03:09.059 --> 00:03:11.479
 your country house engras like that 

00:03:11.479 --> 00:03:13.299
 frankly you're kidding 

00:03:13.299 --> 00:03:15.829
 Friday we made efforts to keep the 

00:03:15.829 --> 00:03:18.249
 maybe to make their talent talk 

00:03:18.249 --> 00:03:21.249
 No, but I would still like something is that we teenagers 

00:03:22.669 --> 00:03:25.169
 we help them in France we have a little rotten m 

00:03:25.169 --> 00:03:28.119
 did you see the elected officials in the us how they are too stylish 

00:03:28.119 --> 00:03:29.679

00:03:29.679 --> 00:03:31.659
 with what is asked of him 

00:03:31.659 --> 00:03:34.409
 for you it is rather him yes 

00:03:34.409 --> 00:03:37.649
 you saw how they proceeded n is only a sample this for nothing 

00:03:37.649 --> 00:03:40.939
 in total the police and in French and it will do it well 

00:03:43.259 --> 00:03:45.229
 you go police in the usa 

00:03:45.229 --> 00:03:47.599
 we will rest 

00:03:47.599 --> 00:03:49.139
 because the high school in the usa 

00:03:49.139 --> 00:03:52.119
 his name is west ham kravchenko 

00:03:52.119 --> 00:03:54.479
 the police marie-france doyez 

00:03:54.479 --> 00:03:57.969
 I do not see what we can call the police do not it's based on dakar that 

00:03:57.969 --> 00:03:58.949
 to mark 

00:03:58.949 --> 00:04:00.080
 thouars and cockroaches 

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:00.850
 Alas 

00:04:00.850 --> 00:04:03.850
 Alas 

00:04:10.739 --> 00:04:13.739
 it went very well - I can very well 

00:04:14.399 --> 00:04:16.419
 it does not do very well 

00:04:16.419 --> 00:04:19.559
 a mare translated in my life I lost my goldfish 

00:04:19.559 --> 00:04:23.279
 e nan it leaves feathers made a lot of sores and besides this just 

00:04:23.279 --> 00:04:25.859
 before his death I learned that the goldfish only had three seconds of 

00:04:25.859 --> 00:04:26.990
 memory 

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:29.990
 so horrible imagining his say 

00:04:31.939 --> 00:04:34.939
 see the subject russia 

00:04:36.689 --> 00:04:39.689
 I'm fine here too 

00:04:41.349 --> 00:04:43.439
 whereas if I did 

00:04:43.439 --> 00:04:46.169
 that day I realized that my mother had a fish brain 

00:04:46.169 --> 00:04:49.169
 red lombard for the cgc 

00:04:51.529 --> 00:04:54.529
 for the little info 

00:05:03.029 --> 00:05:06.169
 and then the guests the warrant I started to call the 36 06 

00:05:06.169 --> 00:05:09.179
 you know this bus 36 06 more these more stingy beasts 

00:05:10.729 --> 00:05:13.009
 what I ask is that we put our neighbors in the stations 

00:05:13.009 --> 00:05:16.009
 in neighbor if the brigade in the city of ottawa 

00:05:18.259 --> 00:05:22.039
 if to find them love and not have to rehabilitate us and could weaken 

00:05:22.039 --> 00:05:25.039
 recife 

00:05:26.729 --> 00:05:28.229
 the three rivals tonight 

00:05:28.229 --> 00:05:31.510
 l it really got me a lot better than that and it really did a lot better 

00:05:31.510 --> 00:05:33.069
 the day will travel to africa 

00:05:33.069 --> 00:05:34.340

00:05:34.340 --> 00:05:37.669

00:05:37.669 --> 00:05:38.600
 It's awesome 

00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:42.060

00:05:42.060 --> 00:05:44.099
 it's cnbc 

00:05:44.099 --> 00:05:47.210
 serious the first day of the eid in the season posted on thursday 

00:05:47.210 --> 00:05:50.210
 dangerous that would exclude could I connect on the stage 

00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:52.849
 but it still did not 

00:05:52.849 --> 00:05:55.389
 but she moved 

00:05:55.389 --> 00:05:56.610
 m 

00:05:56.610 --> 00:05:58.089
 which pays 10 h 20 

00:05:58.089 --> 00:06:00.779
 I did not care I was too happy I had three areas in the solo 

00:06:00.779 --> 00:06:04.089

00:06:05.180 --> 00:06:08.180

00:06:41.919 --> 00:06:44.919
 in complicated matters 

00:06:45.749 --> 00:06:47.229
 the events 

00:06:47.229 --> 00:06:49.219
 it's gone alone 

00:06:49.219 --> 00:06:51.369
 at the limit I want to change 

00:06:51.369 --> 00:06:54.369

 but for the moment I have a bit of my life between the CNT and the courses and 

00:07:47.599 --> 00:07:50.949
 it's not always easy at the end of the day to Monday night in a scene 

00:07:50.949 --> 00:07:52.029
