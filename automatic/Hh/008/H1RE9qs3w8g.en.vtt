okay so welcome to part three of my 4x4
Rubik's<00:00:04.140> Cube<00:00:04.500> tutorial<00:00:04.980> and<00:00:05.250> at<00:00:06.000> this<00:00:06.150> point

00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:06.390 
Rubik's Cube tutorial and at this point

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:07.880 
Rubik's Cube tutorial and at this point
you<00:00:06.509> should<00:00:06.540> have<00:00:06.870> all<00:00:07.230> of<00:00:07.290> the<00:00:07.500> centers

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:07.890 
you should have all of the centers

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:11.540 
you should have all of the centers
solved<00:00:08.670> for<00:00:08.910> and<00:00:09.469> you<00:00:10.469> should<00:00:10.620> also<00:00:10.740> have<00:00:10.920> all

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:11.550 
solved for and you should also have all

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:13.820 
solved for and you should also have all
of<00:00:11.610> the<00:00:12.120> edge<00:00:12.330> pieces<00:00:12.660> matched<00:00:13.049> notice<00:00:13.740> how

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:13.830 
of the edge pieces matched notice how

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:15.350 
of the edge pieces matched notice how
these<00:00:13.980> blue<00:00:14.219> and<00:00:14.250> yellow<00:00:14.490> edge<00:00:14.849> pieces<00:00:15.210> are

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:15.360 
these blue and yellow edge pieces are

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:17.720 
these blue and yellow edge pieces are
matched<00:00:15.570> every<00:00:16.500> single<00:00:16.770> edged<00:00:16.920> piece<00:00:17.190> should

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:17.730 
matched every single edged piece should

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:20.390 
matched every single edged piece should
be<00:00:17.850> matched<00:00:18.090> and<00:00:18.990> essentially<00:00:19.710> what<00:00:19.949> what<00:00:20.310> we

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:20.400 
be matched and essentially what what we

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:22.460 
be matched and essentially what what we
have<00:00:20.520> done<00:00:20.670> so<00:00:20.910> far<00:00:20.939> is<00:00:21.390> we've<00:00:22.050> turned<00:00:22.289> this

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:22.470 
have done so far is we've turned this

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:26.300 
have done so far is we've turned this
4x4<00:00:23.220> Rubik's<00:00:23.640> cube<00:00:24.090> into<00:00:25.019> a<00:00:25.050> 3x3<00:00:25.769> rubik's<00:00:26.039> cube

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:26.310 
4x4 Rubik's cube into a 3x3 rubik's cube

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:30.290 
4x4 Rubik's cube into a 3x3 rubik's cube
you<00:00:26.880> can<00:00:27.029> treat<00:00:27.300> this<00:00:27.689> white<00:00:28.019> centre<00:00:29.300> exactly

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:30.300 
you can treat this white centre exactly

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:33.490 
you can treat this white centre exactly
the<00:00:30.420> same<00:00:30.660> as<00:00:31.040> this<00:00:32.040> white<00:00:32.219> Center<00:00:32.550> in<00:00:32.730> the<00:00:33.059> 3x3

00:00:33.490 --> 00:00:33.500 
the same as this white Center in the 3x3

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:36.470 
the same as this white Center in the 3x3
okay<00:00:34.500> and<00:00:34.710> you<00:00:34.770> can<00:00:34.920> treat<00:00:35.219> this<00:00:35.520> these<00:00:36.270> two

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:36.480 
okay and you can treat this these two

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:39.680 
okay and you can treat this these two
green<00:00:37.380> and<00:00:37.649> and<00:00:37.920> yellow<00:00:38.190> edge<00:00:38.399> pieces<00:00:38.730> exactly

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690 
green and and yellow edge pieces exactly

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:42.229 
green and and yellow edge pieces exactly
the<00:00:39.989> same<00:00:40.230> as<00:00:40.500> you<00:00:41.129> would<00:00:41.280> this<00:00:41.640> green<00:00:42.000> and

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:42.239 
the same as you would this green and

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:44.810 
the same as you would this green and
yellow<00:00:42.690> edge<00:00:42.840> piece<00:00:43.079> for<00:00:43.469> the<00:00:43.739> 3x3<00:00:44.520> rubik's

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:44.820 
yellow edge piece for the 3x3 rubik's

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:46.729 
yellow edge piece for the 3x3 rubik's
cube<00:00:45.030> so<00:00:45.809> once<00:00:45.989> again<00:00:46.110> we've<00:00:46.350> kind<00:00:46.559> of<00:00:46.590> turned

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:46.739 
cube so once again we've kind of turned

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:50.630 
cube so once again we've kind of turned
this<00:00:46.920> 4x4<00:00:47.280> Rubik's<00:00:47.850> cube<00:00:48.239> into<00:00:48.510> a<00:00:48.539> 3x3<00:00:49.260> and<00:00:49.640> for

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 
this 4x4 Rubik's cube into a 3x3 and for

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:53.330 
this 4x4 Rubik's cube into a 3x3 and for
much<00:00:51.090> of<00:00:51.300> this<00:00:51.510> that<00:00:51.809> you<00:00:52.680> solve<00:00:52.949> it<00:00:53.160> exactly

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340 
much of this that you solve it exactly

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:56.689 
much of this that you solve it exactly
the<00:00:53.879> same<00:00:53.910> way<00:00:54.120> as<00:00:54.600> you<00:00:55.379> would<00:00:55.559> a<00:00:55.770> 3x3<00:00:56.399> rubik's

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
the same way as you would a 3x3 rubik's

00:00:56.699 --> 00:00:58.490 
the same way as you would a 3x3 rubik's
cube<00:00:56.910> so<00:00:57.539> that's<00:00:57.719> actually<00:00:57.899> what<00:00:58.199> I'm<00:00:58.289> going

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
cube so that's actually what I'm going

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:01.160 
cube so that's actually what I'm going
to<00:00:58.559> do<00:00:58.770> I'm<00:00:59.370> going<00:00:59.579> to<00:00:59.640> solve<00:00:59.850> this<00:01:00.510> top<00:01:00.840> white

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
to do I'm going to solve this top white

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:04.700 
to do I'm going to solve this top white
side<00:01:01.440> of<00:01:01.649> the<00:01:01.739> cube<00:01:02.120> plus<00:01:03.120> this<00:01:03.840> top<00:01:04.110> layer<00:01:04.409> and

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710 
side of the cube plus this top layer and

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:06.800 
side of the cube plus this top layer and
two<00:01:04.949> middle<00:01:05.220> layers<00:01:05.430> I'm<00:01:06.270> going<00:01:06.540> to<00:01:06.600> solve

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
two middle layers I'm going to solve

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:09.440 
two middle layers I'm going to solve
that<00:01:06.900> exactly<00:01:07.650> the<00:01:07.799> same<00:01:08.010> way<00:01:08.220> as<00:01:08.430> my<00:01:08.790> 3x3

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450 
that exactly the same way as my 3x3

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:11.420 
that exactly the same way as my 3x3
rubik's<00:01:09.750> cube<00:01:09.960> and<00:01:10.830> if<00:01:11.010> you<00:01:11.100> don't<00:01:11.250> know<00:01:11.340> how

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
rubik's cube and if you don't know how

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:13.700 
rubik's cube and if you don't know how
to<00:01:11.490> do<00:01:11.610> this<00:01:11.700> already<00:01:11.970> I<00:01:12.260> suggest<00:01:13.260> you<00:01:13.380> go<00:01:13.500> back

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
to do this already I suggest you go back

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:15.859 
to do this already I suggest you go back
to<00:01:14.010> part<00:01:14.430> one<00:01:14.460> part<00:01:15.000> two<00:01:15.090> and<00:01:15.360> part<00:01:15.420> three<00:01:15.630> of

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869 
to part one part two and part three of

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:19.160 
to part one part two and part three of
my<00:01:16.049> 3x3<00:01:17.009> tutorials<00:01:17.610> I'm<00:01:18.479> assuming<00:01:18.930> since

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
my 3x3 tutorials I'm assuming since

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:20.690 
my 3x3 tutorials I'm assuming since
you're<00:01:19.259> doing<00:01:19.350> a<00:01:19.500> 4x4<00:01:19.979> that<00:01:20.009> you<00:01:20.250> do<00:01:20.430> know<00:01:20.580> how

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
you're doing a 4x4 that you do know how

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:23.539 
you're doing a 4x4 that you do know how
to<00:01:20.729> do<00:01:20.909> this<00:01:21.060> already<00:01:21.330> so<00:01:22.320> I'm<00:01:22.950> going<00:01:23.130> to<00:01:23.220> solve

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:23.549 
to do this already so I'm going to solve

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:26.960 
to do this already so I'm going to solve
this<00:01:23.670> top<00:01:24.210> side<00:01:24.479> plus<00:01:25.409> the<00:01:25.470> top<00:01:25.770> layer<00:01:26.040> and<00:01:26.369> the

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
this top side plus the top layer and the

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:35.640 
this top side plus the top layer and the
two<00:01:27.119> middle<00:01:27.420> layers

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:35.650 

00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:48.300 

you

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:48.310 

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:51.070 

okay<00:01:49.310> so<00:01:49.370> at<00:01:49.580> this<00:01:49.670> point<00:01:50.090> I<00:01:50.360> just<00:01:50.390> solve<00:01:50.870> the

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:51.080 
okay so at this point I just solve the

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:54.120 
okay so at this point I just solve the
top<00:01:51.320> side<00:01:51.650> the<00:01:52.400> top<00:01:52.670> layer<00:01:52.970> and<00:01:53.150> middle<00:01:53.450> layer

00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:54.130 
top side the top layer and middle layer

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:56.860 
top side the top layer and middle layer
exactly<00:01:55.130> the<00:01:55.220> same<00:01:55.430> way<00:01:55.670> as<00:01:55.970> I<00:01:56.420> would<00:01:56.630> solve

00:01:56.860 --> 00:01:56.870 
exactly the same way as I would solve

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:59.380 
exactly the same way as I would solve
the<00:01:57.140> top<00:01:57.590> side<00:01:58.070> and<00:01:58.100> the<00:01:58.460> top<00:01:58.970> and<00:01:59.180> middle

00:01:59.380 --> 00:01:59.390 
the top side and the top and middle

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:03.520 
the top side and the top and middle
layer<00:01:59.570> of<00:01:59.810> the<00:01:59.920> 3x3<00:02:00.920> cube<00:02:01.420> all<00:02:02.420> right<00:02:02.630> and<00:02:02.930> at

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:03.530 
layer of the 3x3 cube all right and at

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:06.400 
layer of the 3x3 cube all right and at
this<00:02:03.650> point<00:02:03.890> the<00:02:04.160> 4x4<00:02:04.790> gets<00:02:05.300> incredibly<00:02:06.229> more

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:06.410 
this point the 4x4 gets incredibly more

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:09.910 
this point the 4x4 gets incredibly more
difficult<00:02:06.920> than<00:02:07.640> the<00:02:07.850> 3x3<00:02:08.270> and<00:02:08.709> this<00:02:09.709> is

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:09.920 
difficult than the 3x3 and this is

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:12.820 
difficult than the 3x3 and this is
because<00:02:10.399> in<00:02:10.820> the<00:02:11.300> 4x4<00:02:11.959> you<00:02:12.410> have<00:02:12.530> something

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:12.830 
because in the 4x4 you have something

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:15.880 
because in the 4x4 you have something
that<00:02:12.950> occurs<00:02:13.220> called<00:02:13.700> parity<00:02:14.540> all<00:02:15.470> right<00:02:15.650> and

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:15.890 
that occurs called parity all right and

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:19.120 
that occurs called parity all right and
in<00:02:16.520> order<00:02:16.610> to<00:02:16.790> fix<00:02:17.030> parity<00:02:17.800> you<00:02:18.800> have<00:02:18.950> these

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:19.130 
in order to fix parity you have these

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:21.400 
in order to fix parity you have these
incredibly<00:02:19.760> long<00:02:20.000> algorithms<00:02:20.600> that<00:02:21.230> are

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:21.410 
incredibly long algorithms that are

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:24.400 
incredibly long algorithms that are
really<00:02:21.739> difficult<00:02:21.920> to<00:02:22.250> memorize<00:02:22.840> so<00:02:23.840> that<00:02:24.200> is

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:24.410 
really difficult to memorize so that is

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:26.380 
really difficult to memorize so that is
what<00:02:24.620> I'm<00:02:24.830> going<00:02:25.130> to<00:02:25.220> go<00:02:25.700> over<00:02:25.730> in<00:02:26.060> my<00:02:26.150> next

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:26.390 
what I'm going to go over in my next

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:28.180 
what I'm going to go over in my next
video<00:02:26.630> I'm<00:02:27.290> going<00:02:27.590> to<00:02:27.709> teach<00:02:27.860> you<00:02:27.890> how<00:02:28.160> to

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:28.190 
video I'm going to teach you how to

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:31.600 
video I'm going to teach you how to
solve<00:02:28.610> the<00:02:28.940> rest<00:02:29.390> of<00:02:29.660> the<00:02:29.810> cube<00:02:30.110> and<00:02:30.459> teach<00:02:31.459> you

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:31.610 
solve the rest of the cube and teach you

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:34.960 
solve the rest of the cube and teach you
what<00:02:31.760> happens<00:02:32.150> when<00:02:32.840> this<00:02:33.050> parity<00:02:33.560> occurs<00:02:34.160> so

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:34.970 
what happens when this parity occurs so

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:36.100 
what happens when this parity occurs so
I'm<00:02:35.090> hoping<00:02:35.360> you're<00:02:35.510> enjoying<00:02:35.540> these
