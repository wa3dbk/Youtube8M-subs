yeah I want to show you my home made
espresso<00:00:12.020> machine<00:00:12.970> this<00:00:13.970> is<00:00:14.500> basically<00:00:15.610> a

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:16.750 
espresso machine this is basically a

00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:21.730 
espresso machine this is basically a
wrench<00:00:17.750> in<00:00:18.020> your<00:00:18.050> Silvia<00:00:19.330> that<00:00:20.330> I<00:00:20.930> have<00:00:21.349> taken

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:21.740 
wrench in your Silvia that I have taken

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:54.460 
wrench in your Silvia that I have taken
apart<00:00:22.160> you<00:00:23.060> would<00:00:23.210> some<00:00:23.630> of<00:00:23.660> it

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:36.320 
that Luca pump this is the water tank

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:39.920 
that Luca pump this is the water tank
can<00:01:37.320> be<00:01:37.470> taken<00:01:37.830> out<00:01:37.950> by<00:01:38.160> having<00:01:38.310> a<00:01:38.930> backplate

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:39.930 
can be taken out by having a backplate

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:43.550 
can be taken out by having a backplate
for<00:01:40.200> this<00:01:40.380> so<00:01:41.150> normally<00:01:42.150> this<00:01:42.390> is<00:01:42.720> not<00:01:42.780> to<00:01:43.440> be

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560 
for this so normally this is not to be

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:46.700 
for this so normally this is not to be
taken<00:01:43.770> out<00:01:44.070> you<00:01:45.030> will<00:01:45.270> fill<00:01:45.600> the<00:01:45.900> water<00:01:46.140> from

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:46.710 
taken out you will fill the water from

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:59.630 
taken out you will fill the water from
above<00:01:47.280> I<00:01:52.220> have<00:01:53.220> made<00:01:53.520> the<00:01:55.610> steam<00:01:56.610> pond<00:01:56.910> and<00:01:58.640> in

00:01:59.630 --> 00:01:59.640 
above I have made the steam pond and in

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:07.910 
above I have made the steam pond and in
here<00:02:00.149> all<00:02:01.080> has<00:02:01.860> been<00:02:03.560> isolated<00:02:06.020> as<00:02:07.020> good<00:02:07.800> as

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:07.920 
here all has been isolated as good as

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:23.230 
here all has been isolated as good as
possible<00:02:08.160> hot<00:02:08.640> water<00:02:12.260> you<00:02:13.260> have<00:02:13.410> to<00:02:13.440> turn

standard see ya and that see the group

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:42.980 
standard see ya and that see the group
it<00:02:34.700> is<00:02:35.700> present<00:02:36.240> through<00:02:38.900> this<00:02:39.900> you<00:02:40.110> saw<00:02:41.990> the

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:42.990 
it is present through this you saw the

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:52.210 
it is present through this you saw the
water<00:02:43.260> button<00:02:44.600> is<00:02:45.600> open<00:02:46.370> and<00:02:48.650> the<00:02:50.690> steel

00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:52.220 
water button is open and the steel

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:59.330 
water button is open and the steel
boiler<00:02:53.720> heat<00:02:54.720> up<00:02:57.140> I'm<00:02:58.140> gonna<00:02:58.320> stop<00:02:58.680> that<00:02:58.890> no

00:02:59.330 --> 00:02:59.340 
boiler heat up I'm gonna stop that no

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:17.810 
boiler heat up I'm gonna stop that no
burn<00:03:00.110> steam<00:03:10.670> and<00:03:11.900> give<00:03:12.900> some<00:03:16.610> pretty<00:03:17.610> good

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:17.820 
burn steam and give some pretty good

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:28.310 
burn steam and give some pretty good
team<00:03:19.100> and<00:03:21.200> manometer<00:03:22.220> where<00:03:23.220> you<00:03:23.280> can<00:03:23.459> see<00:03:27.320> the

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:28.320 
team and manometer where you can see the

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:36.770 
team and manometer where you can see the
pressure<00:03:28.620> in<00:03:29.070> the<00:03:29.400> steam<00:03:29.730> panel<00:03:35.300> also<00:03:36.300> with

00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:36.780 
pressure in the steam panel also with

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:41.270 
pressure in the steam panel also with
this<00:03:37.910> temperature<00:03:38.910> controlled<00:03:39.510> on<00:03:40.280> precious

00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:41.280 
this temperature controlled on precious

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:45.350 
this temperature controlled on precious
that<00:03:41.790> and<00:03:42.120> not<00:03:42.810> on<00:03:43.110> temperature<00:03:43.890> so<00:03:44.250> I<00:03:44.489> have<00:03:45.209> to

00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:45.360 
that and not on temperature so I have to

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:48.910 
that and not on temperature so I have to
adjust<00:03:45.510> it<00:03:45.900> for<00:03:46.200> two<00:03:46.950> baths<00:03:47.280> to<00:03:48.150> give<00:03:48.540> about

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:48.920 
adjust it for two baths to give about

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:56.000 
adjust it for two baths to give about
120<00:03:49.920> degrees<00:03:50.310> Celsius<00:03:53.209> and<00:03:54.230> because<00:03:55.230> I<00:03:55.709> have

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:56.010 
120 degrees Celsius and because I have

00:03:56.010 --> 00:03:59.560 
120 degrees Celsius and because I have
built<00:03:56.370> in<00:03:56.489> though<00:03:56.750> the<00:03:57.750> local<00:03:58.530> PLC<00:03:59.070> control

00:03:59.560 --> 00:03:59.570 
built in though the local PLC control

00:03:59.570 --> 00:04:04.750 
built in though the local PLC control
I've<00:04:00.570> been<00:04:00.870> able<00:04:01.080> to<00:04:02.209> make<00:04:03.209> some<00:04:03.390> programming

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:04.760 
I've been able to make some programming

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:09.610 
I've been able to make some programming
which<00:04:05.930> actually<00:04:06.930> means<00:04:07.080> that<00:04:07.500> if<00:04:07.860> I<00:04:08.040> want<00:04:08.280> to

00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:09.620 
which actually means that if I want to

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:13.190 
which actually means that if I want to
fill<00:04:10.620> my<00:04:11.030> steam<00:04:12.030> bottle<00:04:12.450> with<00:04:12.600> water

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:13.200 
fill my steam bottle with water

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:19.729 
fill my steam bottle with water
I<00:04:13.230> just<00:04:17.030> yeah

00:04:19.729 --> 00:04:19.739 
I just yeah

00:04:19.739 --> 00:04:27.950 
I just yeah
but<00:04:22.099> that's<00:04:23.099> filling<00:04:23.580> up<00:04:23.699> I<00:04:26.539> have<00:04:27.539> made<00:04:27.750> them<00:04:27.900> a

00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:27.960 
but that's filling up I have made them a

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:35.059 
but that's filling up I have made them a
program<00:04:28.740> for<00:04:29.310> auto<00:04:30.150> back<00:04:30.960> flush<00:04:31.460> so<00:04:32.460> if<00:04:32.699> I<00:04:34.069> do

00:04:35.059 --> 00:04:35.069 
program for auto back flush so if I do

00:04:35.069 --> 00:04:37.939 
program for auto back flush so if I do
like<00:04:35.340> that<00:04:35.400> it<00:04:36.000> will<00:04:36.180> run<00:04:36.449> a<00:04:36.690> back<00:04:37.590> flush

00:04:37.939 --> 00:04:37.949 
like that it will run a back flush

00:04:37.949 --> 00:04:42.909 
like that it will run a back flush
program<00:04:38.819> I<00:04:39.060> was<00:04:39.419> a<00:04:39.750> little<00:04:40.229> bit<00:04:41.360> annoyed<00:04:42.360> about

00:04:42.909 --> 00:04:42.919 
program I was a little bit annoyed about

00:04:42.919 --> 00:04:47.140 
program I was a little bit annoyed about
the<00:04:43.919> size<00:04:44.220> of<00:04:44.490> the<00:04:44.699> drip<00:04:45.000> tray<00:04:45.289> under<00:04:46.289> standard

00:04:47.140 --> 00:04:47.150 
the size of the drip tray under standard

00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:52.129 
the size of the drip tray under standard
Silvia<00:04:49.009> so<00:04:50.009> I<00:04:50.039> have<00:04:50.639> made<00:04:50.910> a<00:04:50.970> drip<00:04:51.449> tray<00:04:51.690> with

00:04:52.129 --> 00:04:52.139 
Silvia so I have made a drip tray with

00:04:52.139 --> 00:05:00.830 
Silvia so I have made a drip tray with
one<00:04:52.889> liter<00:04:53.690> capacity<00:04:55.789> and<00:04:57.020> that<00:04:59.659> that<00:05:00.659> is

00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:00.840 
one liter capacity and that that is

00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:09.559 
one liter capacity and that that is
enough<00:05:01.139> I<00:05:02.060> should<00:05:03.060> say<00:05:04.370> my<00:05:05.930> brand<00:05:06.930> my<00:05:08.569> chronic

00:05:09.559 --> 00:05:09.569 
enough I should say my brand my chronic

00:05:09.569 --> 00:05:13.850 
enough I should say my brand my chronic
buyer<00:05:09.780> I<00:05:10.250> will<00:05:11.250> show<00:05:11.430> you<00:05:11.720> and<00:05:12.720> espresso<00:05:13.470> shots

buyer I will show you and espresso shots

00:05:13.860 --> 00:06:17.930 
buyer I will show you and espresso shots
on<00:05:14.220> my<00:05:14.490> machine

00:07:12.379 --> 00:07:12.389 

00:07:12.389 --> 00:07:16.590 

nice<00:07:13.389> microphone<00:07:15.060> couldn't<00:07:16.060> be<00:07:16.210> better

00:07:16.590 --> 00:07:16.600 
nice microphone couldn't be better

00:07:16.600 --> 00:07:31.410 
nice microphone couldn't be better
but<00:07:17.160> chat<00:07:18.160> with<00:07:18.370> just<00:07:18.610> one<00:07:18.790> hand

00:07:46.200 --> 00:07:46.210 
I think it is running a nice same size

00:07:46.210 --> 00:07:53.030 
I think it is running a nice same size
