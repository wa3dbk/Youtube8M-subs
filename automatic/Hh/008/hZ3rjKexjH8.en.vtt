I ever packed a Lavezzi here we go this
good<00:02:13.530> let's<00:02:13.680> go

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:13.920 
good let's go

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:15.230 
good let's go
and<00:02:13.980> check<00:02:14.190> how<00:02:14.370> much<00:02:14.490> he<00:02:14.670> goes<00:02:14.819> for<00:02:15.090> this

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:15.240 
and check how much he goes for this

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:17.660 
and check how much he goes for this
could<00:02:15.630> be<00:02:15.810> pretty<00:02:16.050> good<00:02:16.349> I'm<00:02:16.770> pretty<00:02:17.250> sure<00:02:17.430> his

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:17.670 
could be pretty good I'm pretty sure his

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:19.910 
could be pretty good I'm pretty sure his
price<00:02:17.910> went<00:02:18.150> down<00:02:18.239> an<00:02:18.569> awful<00:02:19.170> ton<00:02:19.410> because<00:02:19.680> of

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:19.920 
price went down an awful ton because of

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:22.880 
price went down an awful ton because of
team<00:02:20.130> season<00:02:20.610> but<00:02:21.120> I'll<00:02:21.360> just<00:02:21.720> check<00:02:21.989> decent

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:22.890 
team season but I'll just check decent

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:25.309 
team season but I'll just check decent
that<00:02:23.370> is<00:02:23.489> probably<00:02:23.670> the<00:02:23.910> best<00:02:24.180> player<00:02:24.930> we<00:02:25.140> have

00:02:25.309 --> 00:02:25.319

been worse i'm i'm guessing like if we
didn't<00:03:25.980> get<00:03:26.070> Lavezzi<00:03:26.670> it<00:03:27.030> would<00:03:27.239> have<00:03:27.359> been<00:03:27.480> so

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:27.780 
didn't get Lavezzi it would have been so

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:30.349 
didn't get Lavezzi it would have been so
much<00:03:27.810> worse<00:03:28.200> but<00:03:29.040> the<00:03:29.549> vets<00:03:29.760> you<00:03:29.910> just<00:03:30.120> saved

00:03:30.349 --> 00:03:30.359
