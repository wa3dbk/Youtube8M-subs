00:00:00.439 --> 00:00:07.080
 good evening today will tell you 

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:11.480
 player mp3 player texet t 795 player 

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:13.500
 inexpensive costs 230 hryvnia and and disaster 

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:19.320
 standard player functions 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:24.710
 that is, whether there are music video recording files 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:28.580
 voice recorder radio photos and text 

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:31.529
 released from the text of the father of us 

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:35.700
 I will show that I will not support the file 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:37.500
 supports file.txt same numbers 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:38.370
 read such a small screen is not very 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:42.059
 it is convenient 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:45.840
 further photos are waiting for us too 

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:48.059
 see photos to drive the what what 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:50.570
 very good we can now delete both 

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:51.750
 photos are also there and various other 

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:55.379
 files 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:56.300
 on the radio, too, I am a radio spot it is very 

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:59.340
 not bad 

00:00:56.300 --> 00:01:01.829
 well, except to look for stations 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:03.420
 A little inconvenient at all management 

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:07.170
 player a little uncomfortable there is only 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:10.409
 five buttons and including these buttons 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:14.509
 need to adjust all functions allow 

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:17.250
 make the sound louder music liu costumes and 

00:01:14.509 --> 00:01:17.759
 Here, too, I myself choose right and left 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:20.780
 lines 

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:23.040
 what to do louder muse continue waves 

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:25.020
 volume and set up there and so 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:28.770
 go back to the tracks this again 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:31.710
 clicking from there is not very convenient then what 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:33.900
 you can not climb into the menu from the photo times 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:35.210
 listen to music but how can you 

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:39.390
 cope example 

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:40.439
 files obse option we have that date and 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:43.970
 time display 

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:47.240
 language off information gifts are 

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:51.450
 how much memory is left how much is occupied and 

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:53.549
 reset settings will also say 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:58.770
 voice recorder of course the whole world 

00:01:53.549 --> 00:02:00.899
 there is a microphone here it is because 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:04.380
 very good recording today 

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:06.880
 still bad and hard to hear 

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:10.569
 additional bonus axis. 

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:14.650
 video also has video and can also 

00:02:10.569 --> 00:02:20.319
 watch daffy duck pretty good 

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:25.480
 show can be started up pretty 

00:02:20.319 --> 00:02:27.880
 shows well and that the brain is also very 

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:30.130
 conveniently what shows to this video by 

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:33.610
 account here you can merge just how much 

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:36.180
 video is and some video on the account as well 

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:39.370
 the most with music with pictures 

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:43.650
 more and more nothing interesting that 

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:46.900
 I can still show it on these files 

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:50.049
 send file too when opened 

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:53.290
 the trinity is asked width memory take 

00:02:50.049 --> 00:02:57.700
 or memory card is the way they memory 

00:02:53.290 --> 00:03:00.400
 such it has a standard root here 

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:05.140
 back return tone record here 

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:08.380
 recordings from the radio and voice recorder 

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:10.390
 it seems that there is nothing well nafig music 

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:13.510
 photos of the video and there all the rest 

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:17.200

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:20.019
 music about music, we also goes there 

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:22.950
 there is an equalizer also shown 

00:03:20.019 --> 00:03:29.620
 you can place it can be lyrics 

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:33.549

 repeats different repeating files equalizer 

00:03:39.609 --> 00:03:48.150
 also closer there is also us mode

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:54.010
 repeat mode there and display 

00:03:51.329 --> 00:03:58.299
 make you display the end graphic 

00:03:54.010 --> 00:04:01.269
 equalizer or song lyrics like so 

00:03:58.299 --> 00:04:04.420
 perry moore he mows a maximum of 30 and i you 

00:04:01.269 --> 00:04:07.930
 I will say that it plays pretty well 

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:09.840
 but listened on rtr who plays to 

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:13.690
 man and suppose no headphone headphones 

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:16.600
 koss porta pro and pretty normal 

00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:19.570
 plays a little louder on the phone 

00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:22.680
 and so that music can be rewound 

00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:25.120
 there is not very fast of course 

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:27.640
 time is shown all songs 

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:30.730
 how long was the song and the name 

00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:33.910
 artist and the song itself also has 

00:04:30.730 --> 00:04:38.890
 nozings player time is shown 

00:04:33.910 --> 00:04:41.460
 and how many batteries are six left 

00:04:38.890 --> 00:04:41.460
 you can still show 

00:04:41.670 --> 00:04:47.470
 basically everything is so 1 time what do you about 

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:50.470
 say what if let's set up 

00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:53.680
 time there houses set up time tamia 

00:04:50.470 --> 00:04:56.140
 date and turn off through this lever 

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:59.800
 right it gets lost 

00:04:56.140 --> 00:05:01.660
 you can just skip these settings 

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:04.900
 turn off not through this iron 

00:05:01.660 --> 00:05:07.860
 and press the play button or pause and 

00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:10.600
 lie down a bit and the player turns off 

00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:13.120
 You can also be stupid and the switch is the same 

00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:19.960
 the very way and nothing clogs everything 

00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:24.850
 ok how small animation goes 

00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:28.060
 when you start and connects what she already 

00:05:24.850 --> 00:05:31.030
 was the last music or lyrics there 

00:05:28.060 --> 00:05:31.780
 General files I will say that the player is pretty 

00:05:31.030 --> 00:05:35.130
 still good 

00:05:31.780 --> 00:05:38.200
 and everything about him is necessary 

00:05:35.130 --> 00:05:40.810
 Roman cat critical is also not very 

00:05:38.200 --> 00:05:44.770
 this if i think minuses something that is not 

00:05:40.810 --> 00:05:47.680
 very convenient control and maybe 

00:05:44.770 --> 00:05:51.100
 contour perfectionist i will like 

00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:54.160
 the fact that the buttons loudly clap at 

00:05:51.100 --> 00:05:57.460
 pushing in general player is pretty 

00:05:54.160 --> 00:06:00.250
 good plays ok and with and where them them 

00:05:57.460 --> 00:06:02.670
