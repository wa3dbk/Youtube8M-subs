00:02:22.979 --> 00:02:22.989 
international scope so you can't use any

00:02:22.989 --> 00:02:25.740 
international scope so you can't use any
local<00:02:23.409> references<00:02:24.010> or<00:02:24.400> things<00:02:25.360> like<00:02:25.450> that<00:02:25.569> to

yes and so that is the reason out of all

00:02:58.299 --> 00:03:00.270 
yes and so that is the reason out of all
the<00:02:58.450> countries<00:02:58.930> they<00:02:59.170> could<00:02:59.349> have<00:02:59.440> chosen<00:02:59.680> to

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:00.280 
the countries they could have chosen to

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:02.759 
the countries they could have chosen to
be<00:03:00.459> our<00:03:00.640> rivals<00:03:01.120> they<00:03:01.690> chose<00:03:01.989> the<00:03:02.200> German<00:03:02.590> team

00:03:02.759 --> 00:03:02.769 
be our rivals they chose the German team

00:03:02.769 --> 00:03:04.770 
be our rivals they chose the German team
but<00:03:03.340> of<00:03:03.430> course<00:03:03.670> because<00:03:03.940> it's<00:03:04.090> a<00:03:04.150> comedy<00:03:04.480> like

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:04.780 
but of course because it's a comedy like

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:08.699 
but of course because it's a comedy like
we<00:03:04.930> have<00:03:05.140> to<00:03:05.260> do<00:03:05.379> jokes<00:03:05.859> and<00:03:06.930> and<00:03:07.930> we<00:03:08.409> would<00:03:08.590> do

00:03:08.699 --> 00:03:08.709 
we have to do jokes and and we would do

00:03:08.709 --> 00:03:11.910 
we have to do jokes and and we would do
like<00:03:09.150> myself<00:03:10.150> and<00:03:10.659> then<00:03:10.930> flew<00:03:11.319> low<00:03:11.500> who's<00:03:11.739> like

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:11.920 
like myself and then flew low who's like

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:14.339 
like myself and then flew low who's like
one<00:03:12.459> of<00:03:12.489> the<00:03:12.640> German<00:03:13.030> team<00:03:13.209> we<00:03:13.810> would<00:03:13.989> do<00:03:14.140> like

00:03:14.339 --> 00:03:14.349 
one of the German team we would do like

00:03:14.349 --> 00:03:16.710 
one of the German team we would do like
a<00:03:14.409> lot<00:03:14.650> of<00:03:14.680> jokes<00:03:15.099> and<00:03:15.819> I<00:03:16.060> think<00:03:16.269> sometimes<00:03:16.480> the

00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:16.720 
a lot of jokes and I think sometimes the

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:18.240 
a lot of jokes and I think sometimes the
Americans<00:03:17.200> didn't<00:03:17.470> understand<00:03:17.889> what<00:03:18.069> we<00:03:18.160> were

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:18.250 
Americans didn't understand what we were

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:19.920 
Americans didn't understand what we were
talking<00:03:18.549> about<00:03:18.579> because<00:03:19.209> we<00:03:19.239> study<00:03:19.660> like<00:03:19.900> a

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:19.930 
talking about because we study like a

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:23.039 
talking about because we study like a
lot<00:03:20.440> of<00:03:20.530> European<00:03:21.010> history<00:03:21.160> at<00:03:21.489> school<00:03:22.049> and

00:03:23.039 --> 00:03:23.049 
lot of European history at school and

00:03:23.049 --> 00:03:25.559 
lot of European history at school and
but<00:03:23.769> I<00:03:23.799> don't<00:03:24.069> think<00:03:24.190> a<00:03:24.340> lot<00:03:24.519> of<00:03:24.669> the<00:03:25.090> Americans

00:03:25.559 --> 00:03:25.569 
but I don't think a lot of the Americans

00:03:25.569 --> 00:03:27.030 
but I don't think a lot of the Americans
like<00:03:25.750> some<00:03:25.959> of<00:03:26.079> our<00:03:26.200> jokes<00:03:26.410> were<00:03:26.650> going<00:03:26.919> over

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:27.040 
like some of our jokes were going over

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:29.369 
like some of our jokes were going over
their<00:03:27.310> heads<00:03:27.549> a<00:03:27.790> little<00:03:27.910> bit<00:03:28.180> and<00:03:28.750> and<00:03:29.200> how

00:03:29.369 --> 00:03:29.379 
their heads a little bit and and how

00:03:29.379 --> 00:03:31.020 
their heads a little bit and and how
would<00:03:29.440> you<00:03:29.590> describe<00:03:29.950> that<00:03:30.190> German<00:03:30.910> to

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:31.030

00:03:33.059 --> 00:03:33.069 
original what's like a typical stir like

00:03:33.069 --> 00:03:35.970 
original what's like a typical stir like
cliche<00:03:33.700> of<00:03:33.730> Germans<00:03:34.419> then<00:03:34.599> that<00:03:34.989> works<00:03:35.739> that

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:35.980 
cliche of Germans then that works that

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:37.920 
cliche of Germans then that works that
because<00:03:36.190> even<00:03:36.790> at<00:03:36.940> me<00:03:37.120> as<00:03:37.209> a<00:03:37.239> German<00:03:37.569> is<00:03:37.629> like<00:03:37.810> I

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:37.930 
because even at me as a German is like I

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:40.080 
because even at me as a German is like I
wish<00:03:38.410> we<00:03:38.620> would<00:03:38.650> be<00:03:38.859> s<00:03:39.040> perfectionist<00:03:39.760> as<00:03:39.940> this

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:40.090 
wish we would be s perfectionist as this

is<00:03:40.660> one<00:03:41.190> joke<00:03:42.190> that<00:03:42.400> I<00:03:42.519> thought<00:03:42.730> was<00:03:42.849> very

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:42.940 
is one joke that I thought was very

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:46.170 
is one joke that I thought was very
clever<00:03:43.449> when<00:03:44.319> the<00:03:44.650> German<00:03:45.040> team<00:03:45.190> leaves<00:03:45.819> like

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:46.180 
clever when the German team leaves like

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:48.119 
clever when the German team leaves like
they<00:03:46.419> say<00:03:46.900> some<00:03:47.199> mean<00:03:47.349> things<00:03:47.410> to<00:03:47.709> us<00:03:47.859> and<00:03:48.040> then

00:03:48.119 --> 00:03:48.129 
they say some mean things to us and then

00:03:48.129 --> 00:03:51.839 
they say some mean things to us and then
leave<00:03:48.370> and<00:03:48.639> then<00:03:49.030> I<00:03:49.209> say<00:03:49.480> later<00:03:50.169> hozan<00:03:50.980> and<00:03:51.609> I

00:03:51.839 --> 00:03:51.849 
leave and then I say later hozan and I

00:03:51.849 --> 00:03:53.099 
leave and then I say later hozan and I
thought<00:03:52.060> that<00:03:52.239> was<00:03:52.359> like<00:03:52.540> a<00:03:52.569> really<00:03:52.840> good

00:03:53.099 --> 00:03:53.109 
thought that was like a really good

00:03:53.109 --> 00:03:57.300 
thought that was like a really good
German<00:03:53.650> jack<00:03:54.329> but<00:03:55.329> um<00:03:55.620> obviously<00:03:56.620> the<00:03:56.919> editors

00:03:57.300 --> 00:03:57.310 
German jack but um obviously the editors

00:03:57.310 --> 00:04:00.080 
German jack but um obviously the editors
like<00:03:57.459> I<00:03:57.669> don't<00:03:57.849> think<00:03:58.000> they<00:03:58.120> got<00:03:58.329> it<00:03:58.410> but<00:03:59.410> I

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:00.090 
like I don't think they got it but I

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:02.640 
like I don't think they got it but I
thought<00:04:01.090> that<00:04:01.150> was<00:04:01.359> clever<00:04:01.629> yeah<00:04:02.319> of<00:04:02.410> course<00:04:02.590> I

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:02.650 
thought that was clever yeah of course I

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:03.839 
thought that was clever yeah of course I
even<00:04:02.859> Germans<00:04:03.129> wouldn't<00:04:03.400> get<00:04:03.489> it<00:04:03.639> because

00:04:03.839 --> 00:04:03.849 
even Germans wouldn't get it because

00:04:03.849 --> 00:04:05.520 
even Germans wouldn't get it because
like<00:04:04.030> we<00:04:04.150> don't<00:04:04.239> really<00:04:04.449> have<00:04:04.660> that<00:04:04.690> that<00:04:05.109> that

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:05.530 
like we don't really have that that that

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:07.650
