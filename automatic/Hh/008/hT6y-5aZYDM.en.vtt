00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:45.010 
the ground just enough to get the
retention<00:01:43.640> there<00:01:43.969> goes<00:01:44.179> and<00:01:44.420> just<00:01:44.840> keep

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:45.020 
retention there goes and just keep

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:46.929 
retention there goes and just keep
pushing<00:01:45.229> on<00:01:45.439> that<00:01:45.649> as<00:01:45.829> you<00:01:46.189> jack<00:01:46.520> up<00:01:46.549> the<00:01:46.789> rear

00:01:46.929 --> 00:01:46.939 
pushing on that as you jack up the rear

00:01:46.939 --> 00:01:48.520 
pushing on that as you jack up the rear
of<00:01:46.969> the<00:01:47.119> bike<00:01:47.329> and<00:01:47.600> that<00:01:47.959> bolt<00:01:48.259> will<00:01:48.380> come

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:48.530 
of the bike and that bolt will come

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:52.449 
of the bike and that bolt will come
right<00:01:48.709> out<00:01:50.079> like<00:01:51.079> I<00:01:51.200> say<00:01:51.349> Jack<00:01:52.250> up<00:01:52.399> the

00:01:52.449 --> 00:01:52.459 
right out like I say Jack up the

00:01:52.459 --> 00:01:55.270 
right out like I say Jack up the
motorcycle<00:01:52.729> not<00:01:53.060> the<00:01:53.209> swing<00:01:53.479> arm<00:01:53.659> and<00:01:54.280> then

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:55.280 
motorcycle not the swing arm and then

00:01:55.280 --> 00:02:00.069 
motorcycle not the swing arm and then
we'll<00:01:55.579> be<00:01:55.670> back<00:01:55.700> for<00:01:56.000> the<00:01:56.060> next<00:01:56.119> step<00:01:56.509> our<00:01:59.079> next

00:02:00.069 --> 00:02:00.079 
we'll be back for the next step our next

00:02:00.079 --> 00:02:02.889 
we'll be back for the next step our next
step<00:02:00.229> is<00:02:00.380> going<00:02:00.530> to<00:02:00.649> going<00:02:01.280> to<00:02:01.399> be<00:02:01.549> to<00:02:02.179> mount

00:02:02.889 --> 00:02:02.899 
step is going to going to be to mount

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:06.219 
step is going to going to be to mount
this<00:02:03.110> this<00:02:03.709> is<00:02:03.860> their<00:02:04.009> rear<00:02:05.110> actually<00:02:06.110> it's

00:02:06.219 --> 00:02:06.229 
this this is their rear actually it's

00:02:06.229 --> 00:02:08.680 
this this is their rear actually it's
the<00:02:06.319> front<00:02:06.709> of<00:02:06.950> the<00:02:07.069> rear<00:02:07.250> offender<00:02:07.759> bracket

00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:08.690 
the front of the rear offender bracket

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:10.660 
the front of the rear offender bracket
and<00:02:08.899> the<00:02:09.440> way<00:02:09.530> this<00:02:09.679> mounts<00:02:10.099> in<00:02:10.250> there<00:02:10.429> is<00:02:10.549> it

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:10.670 
and the way this mounts in there is it

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:12.720 
and the way this mounts in there is it
mounts<00:02:10.940> on<00:02:11.060> the<00:02:11.239> the<00:02:11.750> bolt<00:02:11.900> that<00:02:12.079> holds<00:02:12.140> the

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:12.730 
mounts on the the bolt that holds the

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:15.039 
mounts on the the bolt that holds the
rear<00:02:13.730> of<00:02:13.760> the<00:02:13.910> shock<00:02:14.150> absorber<00:02:14.599> on<00:02:14.629> the<00:02:14.810> swing

00:02:15.039 --> 00:02:15.049 
rear of the shock absorber on the swing

00:02:15.049 --> 00:02:17.080 
rear of the shock absorber on the swing
arm<00:02:15.230> so<00:02:16.040> anyway<00:02:16.280> this<00:02:16.430> is<00:02:16.489> what<00:02:16.700> the<00:02:16.790> bracket

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:17.090 
arm so anyway this is what the bracket

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:20.559 
arm so anyway this is what the bracket
looks<00:02:17.209> like<00:02:18.099> and<00:02:19.099> basically<00:02:19.700> what<00:02:20.150> it<00:02:20.239> does<00:02:20.269> is

00:02:20.559 --> 00:02:20.569 
looks like and basically what it does is

00:02:20.569 --> 00:02:22.300 
looks like and basically what it does is
it<00:02:20.959> just<00:02:21.109> melts<00:02:21.440> right<00:02:21.500> in<00:02:21.739> in<00:02:21.859> place<00:02:22.069> there

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:22.310 
it just melts right in in place there

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:26.110 
it just melts right in in place there
this<00:02:23.470> this<00:02:24.470> edge<00:02:24.799> here<00:02:25.190> just<00:02:25.400> sits<00:02:25.639> will<00:02:25.910> just

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:26.120 
this this edge here just sits will just

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:28.090 
this this edge here just sits will just
end<00:02:26.389> up<00:02:26.540> sitting<00:02:26.930> on<00:02:27.079> this<00:02:27.230> on<00:02:27.470> the<00:02:27.680> swing<00:02:27.920> arm

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:28.100 
end up sitting on this on the swing arm

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:31.330 
end up sitting on this on the swing arm
there<00:02:28.340> so<00:02:29.590> so<00:02:30.590> what<00:02:30.739> you<00:02:30.859> want<00:02:31.040> to<00:02:31.130> do<00:02:31.220> is<00:02:31.280> you

00:02:57.870 --> 00:02:57.880 
to where we can slide that through there

00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:00.819

00:03:00.819 --> 00:03:00.829 
may have to move the shock up and down a

00:03:00.829 --> 00:03:04.240 
may have to move the shock up and down a
little<00:03:00.950> bit<00:03:01.329> to<00:03:02.329> the<00:03:02.599> rear<00:03:02.750> of<00:03:02.780> the<00:03:02.900> shock<00:03:03.250> so

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:04.250 
little bit to the rear of the shock so

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:05.650 
little bit to the rear of the shock so
go<00:03:04.370> ahead<00:03:04.519> and<00:03:04.639> just<00:03:04.760> check<00:03:05.209> that<00:03:05.359> there<00:03:05.569> it

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:05.660 
go ahead and just check that there it

go ahead and just check that there it
goes<00:03:05.810> it<00:03:05.989> just<00:03:06.319> soon<00:03:06.829> as<00:03:06.889> you<00:03:06.950> get<00:03:07.040> into<00:03:07.190> a

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:07.250 
goes it just soon as you get into a

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:08.589 
goes it just soon as you get into a
point<00:03:07.519> it<00:03:07.669> seems<00:03:07.910> like<00:03:08.060> it<00:03:08.180> just<00:03:08.209> wants<00:03:08.510> to

00:03:08.589 --> 00:03:08.599 
point it seems like it just wants to

00:03:08.599 --> 00:03:10.870 
point it seems like it just wants to
shoot<00:03:08.780> right<00:03:08.959> through<00:03:09.019> there<00:03:09.489> then<00:03:10.489> before<00:03:10.700> it

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:10.880 
shoot right through there then before it

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:12.129 
shoot right through there then before it
comes<00:03:11.120> to<00:03:11.239> the<00:03:11.359> other<00:03:11.450> side<00:03:11.690> make<00:03:11.870> sure<00:03:11.900> it

00:03:12.129 --> 00:03:12.139 
comes to the other side make sure it

00:03:12.139 --> 00:03:14.140 
comes to the other side make sure it
lines<00:03:12.290> up<00:03:12.560> with<00:03:13.340> a<00:03:13.400> bracket<00:03:13.639> on<00:03:13.849> the<00:03:13.910> other

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:14.150 
lines up with a bracket on the other

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:18.069 
lines up with a bracket on the other
side<00:03:14.359> so<00:03:15.669> okay<00:03:16.669> the<00:03:16.819> next<00:03:17.060> step<00:03:17.269> is<00:03:17.630> we<00:03:17.840> want<00:03:18.019> to

00:03:18.069 --> 00:03:18.079 
side so okay the next step is we want to

00:03:18.079 --> 00:03:22.690 
side so okay the next step is we want to
make<00:03:18.230> sure<00:03:18.260> that<00:03:18.709> the<00:03:18.859> nut<00:03:20.200> is<00:03:21.280> in<00:03:22.280> really<00:03:22.489> good

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:22.700 
make sure that the nut is in really good

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:23.229 
make sure that the nut is in really good

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:05.880 
go ahead and put a little Loctite on the

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:12.170 
go ahead and put a little Loctite on the
threads<00:04:06.120> on<00:04:06.300> this<00:04:06.540> on<00:04:07.380> the<00:04:07.650> net<00:04:10.640> and<00:04:11.640> then<00:04:11.910> why

00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:12.180 
threads on this on the net and then why

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:13.220 
threads on this on the net and then why
don't<00:04:12.360> you<00:04:12.390> go<00:04:12.540> ahead<00:04:12.660> and<00:04:12.840> while<00:04:12.989> you<00:04:13.080> do<00:04:13.200> that

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:13.230 
don't you go ahead and while you do that

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:14.690 
don't you go ahead and while you do that
just<00:04:13.530> put<00:04:13.769> a<00:04:13.800> little<00:04:13.980> bit<00:04:14.070> of<00:04:14.160> Loctite<00:04:14.310> around

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:14.700 
just put a little bit of Loctite around

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:18.409 
just put a little bit of Loctite around
that<00:04:14.850> edge<00:04:15.030> of<00:04:15.180> that<00:04:15.560> of<00:04:16.560> that<00:04:16.739> net<00:04:17.269> what<00:04:18.269> that

00:04:18.409 --> 00:04:18.419 
that edge of that of that net what that

00:04:18.419 --> 00:04:21.110 
that edge of that of that net what that
will<00:04:18.510> do<00:04:18.630> that<00:04:18.750> will<00:04:18.810> act<00:04:19.049> as<00:04:19.230> a<00:04:19.260> lubricant<00:04:20.120> so

00:04:21.110 --> 00:04:21.120 
will do that will act as a lubricant so

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:24.409 
will do that will act as a lubricant so
that<00:04:21.329> is<00:04:21.450> that<00:04:21.800> nut<00:04:22.850> swivels<00:04:23.850> against<00:04:24.300> this

00:04:24.409 --> 00:04:24.419 
that is that nut swivels against this

00:04:24.419 --> 00:04:26.420 
that is that nut swivels against this
bracket<00:04:24.960> so<00:04:25.440> we<00:04:25.560> can't<00:04:25.770> use<00:04:25.950> the<00:04:26.100> washer

00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:26.430 
bracket so we can't use the washer

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:28.280 
bracket so we can't use the washer
otherwise<00:04:26.730> though<00:04:26.940> the<00:04:27.180> net<00:04:27.630> won't<00:04:27.750> lock<00:04:28.020> so

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:28.290 
otherwise though the net won't lock so

00:04:28.290 --> 00:04:30.140 
otherwise though the net won't lock so
we're<00:04:28.410> gonna<00:04:28.500> have<00:04:28.680> to<00:04:28.740> rely<00:04:29.070> on<00:04:29.100> this<00:04:29.340> kind<00:04:30.000> of

00:04:30.140 --> 00:04:30.150 
we're gonna have to rely on this kind of

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:32.150 
we're gonna have to rely on this kind of
sliding<00:04:30.480> against<00:04:30.960> the<00:04:31.110> edge<00:04:31.500> of<00:04:31.680> this<00:04:31.830> bracket

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:32.160 
sliding against the edge of this bracket

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:35.110 
sliding against the edge of this bracket
when<00:04:32.550> we<00:04:32.669> tightened<00:04:33.000> it<00:04:33.060> out<00:04:33.180> so<00:04:34.140> go<00:04:34.230> ahead<00:04:34.320> and

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:35.120 
when we tightened it out so go ahead and

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:45.159 
when we tightened it out so go ahead and
start<00:04:36.120> that<00:04:36.330> nut<00:04:36.540> on<00:04:36.660> there

00:04:45.159 --> 00:04:45.169 

00:04:45.169 --> 00:04:47.570 

okay<00:04:46.169> basically<00:04:46.499> what<00:04:47.069> we<00:04:47.159> want<00:04:47.309> to<00:04:47.400> do<00:04:47.490> is

00:04:47.570 --> 00:04:47.580 
okay basically what we want to do is

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:51.350 
okay basically what we want to do is
just<00:04:47.729> tighten<00:04:47.939> it<00:04:48.089> up<00:04:49.159> keeping<00:04:50.159> this<00:04:50.360> this

00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:51.360 
just tighten it up keeping this this

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:54.230 
just tighten it up keeping this this
bracket<00:04:52.159> against<00:04:53.159> the<00:04:53.309> swingarm<00:04:53.669> there<00:04:53.939> so

00:04:54.230 --> 00:04:54.240 
bracket against the swingarm there so

00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:55.760 
bracket against the swingarm there so
I'll<00:04:54.779> go<00:04:54.930> ahead<00:04:54.960> and<00:04:55.169> do<00:04:55.229> that<00:04:55.259> I'll<00:04:55.499> be<00:04:55.589> right

00:04:55.760 --> 00:04:55.770 
I'll go ahead and do that I'll be right

00:04:55.770 --> 00:05:00.499 
I'll go ahead and do that I'll be right
back<00:04:57.889> okay<00:04:58.889> and<00:04:59.069> there<00:04:59.159> we<00:04:59.279> have<00:04:59.430> it<00:04:59.460> I'll<00:05:00.330> go

00:05:00.499 --> 00:05:00.509 
back okay and there we have it I'll go

00:05:00.509 --> 00:05:01.790 
back okay and there we have it I'll go
ahead<00:05:00.569> and<00:05:00.749> move<00:05:00.870> this<00:05:01.020> light<00:05:01.259> around<00:05:01.469> so<00:05:01.710> you

00:05:01.790 --> 00:05:01.800 
ahead and move this light around so you

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:03.589 
ahead and move this light around so you
can<00:05:01.919> see<00:05:02.069> that<00:05:02.309> see<00:05:02.669> what<00:05:02.789> it<00:05:02.879> looks<00:05:02.999> like<00:05:03.089> when

00:05:03.589 --> 00:05:03.599 
can see that see what it looks like when

00:05:03.599 --> 00:05:05.600 
can see that see what it looks like when
it's<00:05:03.719> finished<00:05:03.830> like<00:05:04.830> I<00:05:04.860> say<00:05:05.039> this<00:05:05.189> bracket

00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:05.610 
it's finished like I say this bracket

00:05:05.610 --> 00:05:06.799 
it's finished like I say this bracket
should<00:05:05.759> be<00:05:05.909> right<00:05:06.210> here<00:05:06.389> it<00:05:06.449> should<00:05:06.539> be<00:05:06.599> laying

00:05:06.799 --> 00:05:06.809 
should be right here it should be laying

00:05:06.809 --> 00:05:11.510 
should be right here it should be laying
against<00:05:07.229> the<00:05:07.319> swingarm<00:05:07.740> right<00:05:08.219> here<00:05:10.520> and

00:05:11.510 --> 00:05:11.520 
against the swingarm right here and

00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:12.769 
against the swingarm right here and
there's<00:05:11.849> our<00:05:12.029> nut<00:05:12.210> down<00:05:12.419> there<00:05:12.569> with<00:05:12.719> the

00:05:12.769 --> 00:05:12.779 
there's our nut down there with the

00:05:12.779 --> 00:05:14.360 
there's our nut down there with the
Loctite<00:05:13.139> on<00:05:13.199> it<00:05:13.379> make<00:05:13.770> sure<00:05:13.800> you<00:05:13.979> torque<00:05:14.249> down

00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:14.370 
Loctite on it make sure you torque down

00:05:14.370 --> 00:05:15.649 
Loctite on it make sure you torque down
that<00:05:14.580> pretty<00:05:14.789> tight<00:05:15.029> I<00:05:15.059> think<00:05:15.360> the<00:05:15.449> torque

00:05:15.649 --> 00:05:15.659 
that pretty tight I think the torque

00:05:15.659 --> 00:05:17.540 
that pretty tight I think the torque
specifications<00:05:16.349> on<00:05:16.469> there<00:05:16.650> are<00:05:17.309> probably

00:05:17.540 --> 00:05:17.550 
specifications on there are probably

00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:18.769 
specifications on there are probably

00:05:18.769 --> 00:05:18.779 
pretty high so you want to torque that

00:05:18.779 --> 00:05:22.219 
pretty high so you want to torque that
down<00:05:18.960> really<00:05:19.169> good<00:05:20.479> this<00:05:21.479> the<00:05:21.749> lock<00:05:21.899> tag<00:05:22.110> we

down really good this the lock tag we
use<00:05:22.409> can<00:05:22.680> also<00:05:22.830> be<00:05:23.099> the<00:05:23.460> nut<00:05:23.610> can<00:05:23.759> be<00:05:23.849> taken<00:05:24.120> off

00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:24.210 
use can also be the nut can be taken off

00:05:24.210 --> 00:05:27.170 
use can also be the nut can be taken off
later<00:05:24.479> so<00:05:24.749> don't<00:05:24.839> worry<00:05:25.020> about<00:05:25.139> that<00:05:26.180> that's

later so don't worry about that that's
what<00:05:27.449> it<00:05:27.539> should<00:05:27.569> look<00:05:27.809> like<00:05:27.870> we'll<00:05:28.259> go<00:05:28.379> on<00:05:28.499> to

00:05:28.579 --> 00:05:28.589 
what it should look like we'll go on to

00:05:28.589 --> 00:05:31.129 
what it should look like we'll go on to
the<00:05:28.680> next<00:05:28.800> step
