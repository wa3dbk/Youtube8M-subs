this way when you hook it up to the lid

00:05:16.710 --> 00:05:19.370 
this way when you hook it up to the lid
so<00:05:17.490> when<00:05:17.640> it<00:05:17.760> goes<00:05:18.599> through<00:05:18.750> its<00:05:18.900> cycle<00:05:19.050> it

00:05:19.370 --> 00:05:19.380 
so when it goes through its cycle it

00:05:19.380 --> 00:05:20.570 
so when it goes through its cycle it
goes<00:05:19.590> through<00:05:19.770> this<00:05:19.860> little<00:05:20.039> cutout<00:05:20.340> right

00:05:20.570 --> 00:05:20.580 
goes through this little cutout right

00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:21.730 
goes through this little cutout right
here

00:05:21.730 --> 00:05:21.740 
here

00:05:21.740 --> 00:05:25.070

00:05:27.920 --> 00:05:27.930 
down onto it you can put the spring onto

00:05:27.930 --> 00:05:29.990 
down onto it you can put the spring onto
