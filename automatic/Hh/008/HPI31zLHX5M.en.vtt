a<00:01:13.140> few<00:01:13.409> moments<00:01:13.560> of<00:01:13.829> contemplation<00:01:14.490> to<00:01:14.759> devise

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
a few moments of contemplation to devise

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:17.419 
a few moments of contemplation to devise
a<00:01:15.060> plan<00:01:15.240> to<00:01:15.450> execute<00:01:15.840> the<00:01:16.020> recovery<00:01:16.409> yeah<00:01:17.039> the

00:01:17.419 --> 00:01:17.429 
a plan to execute the recovery yeah the

00:01:17.429 --> 00:01:19.399 
a plan to execute the recovery yeah the
problem<00:01:17.759> with<00:01:17.880> this<00:01:18.149> explanation<00:01:18.659> is<00:01:19.200> it

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 
problem with this explanation is it

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:21.620 
problem with this explanation is it

doesn't provide a clear picture of the

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:24.200 
doesn't provide a clear picture of the
severity<00:01:22.109> of<00:01:22.170> the<00:01:22.409> situation<00:01:22.560> and<00:01:23.130> I'm<00:01:23.819> sure

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210 
severity of the situation and I'm sure

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:25.940 
severity of the situation and I'm sure
whoever<00:01:24.479> happened<00:01:25.109> to<00:01:25.170> be<00:01:25.259> listening<00:01:25.679> to<00:01:25.799> my

story quit right about the same time I

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:29.870 
story quit right about the same time I
started<00:01:28.350> to<00:01:28.409> use<00:01:28.590> those<00:01:28.850> multisyllabic<00:01:29.850> words

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
started to use those multisyllabic words

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:32.690 
started to use those multisyllabic words
to<00:01:30.569> describe<00:01:30.990> it<00:01:31.140> I<00:01:31.289> can<00:01:32.159> see<00:01:32.280> their<00:01:32.429> eyes<00:01:32.460> now

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
to describe it I can see their eyes now

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:35.120 
to describe it I can see their eyes now
glazing<00:01:33.450> over<00:01:33.569> thinking<00:01:34.560> about<00:01:34.799> the<00:01:34.950> baked

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
glazing over thinking about the baked

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:36.830 
glazing over thinking about the baked
bean<00:01:35.369> salad<00:01:35.819> are<00:01:35.969> getting<00:01:36.179> another<00:01:36.450> glass<00:01:36.810> of

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840 
bean salad are getting another glass of

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:38.809 
bean salad are getting another glass of
kool-aid<00:01:37.319> maybe<00:01:37.950> the<00:01:38.100> reason<00:01:38.249> tours<00:01:38.579> use

00:01:38.809 --> 00:01:38.819 
kool-aid maybe the reason tours use

00:01:38.819 --> 00:01:40.609 
kool-aid maybe the reason tours use
expletives<00:01:39.420> to<00:01:39.600> describe<00:01:39.929> recoveries<00:01:40.439> is

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:40.619 
expletives to describe recoveries is

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:42.169 
expletives to describe recoveries is
because<00:01:40.889> they're<00:01:41.399> used<00:01:41.639> to<00:01:41.729> seeing<00:01:41.819> those

00:01:42.169 --> 00:01:42.179 
because they're used to seeing those
