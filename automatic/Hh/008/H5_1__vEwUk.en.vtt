 what they learned during their 

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:56.080
 third internship of your internship I the 

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:57.820
 ssr in doing so following evening 

00:00:56.080 --> 00:00:59.140
 adaptation to saint-etienne du rouvray 

00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:00.790
 I had some apprehensions at the beginning 

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:04.089
 because it's clearly service where 

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:06.280
 people are old enough but in the end 

00:01:04.089 --> 00:01:07.360
 I do not like it, I think it's great 

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:09.370
 nice compared to both courses 

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:10.540
 previous let's say that there is little more 

00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:12.310
 contacts since we're going it's with the 

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:14.890
 people longer people are here 

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:17.799
 usually several months so they have 

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:19.060
 really their place they have the language 

00:01:17.799 --> 00:01:21.460
 shrugged merchant something that I do not 

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:22.690
 did not see in dog heroes and that's 

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:23.950
 really nice having to really talk 

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:25.900
 people there really is another 

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:27.399
 relationship of the nursing team is 

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:28.299
 really really nice so there are two 

00:01:27.399 --> 00:01:31.329
 teams that rotate 

00:01:28.299 --> 00:01:33.250
 one after the other and will be shot 

00:01:31.329 --> 00:01:34.780
 really super nice and really put 

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:35.890
 for my training this morning I made 

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:38.890
 a blood sample 

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:40.570
 so it was my it's my second so 

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:42.549
 this end the farmer mavuba well 

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:44.140
 framing it down really helped and 

00:01:42.549 --> 00:01:46.390
 if not, then I continue especially 

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:48.219
 that she relational and disappoints a little 

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:50.439
 more complex like the removal of 

00:01:48.219 --> 00:01:54.060
 staples or chu girls in front of a 

00:01:50.439 --> 00:01:56.020
 urology service short stays 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:57.579
 whereas before I was more in the 

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:59.679
 movement stay of the blow side 

00:01:57.579 --> 00:02:01.119
 relational I see it's different 

00:01:59.679 --> 00:02:02.950
 from time to time they come for two 

00:02:01.119 --> 00:02:06.009
 days so there is no can not 

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:07.890
 the time to create a contact really I 

00:02:06.009 --> 00:02:09.690
 arrived two weeks ago 

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:11.160
 so I spent two weeks with them 

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:12.900
 caregivers and there from the beginning 

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:14.760
 of the week I arrived with the 

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:16.200
 anti weapons yesterday the goal with the aids 

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:18.959
 caregivers was to validate the 

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:21.360
 competence our skill 3 so care 

00:02:18.959 --> 00:02:22.890
 of well being and comfort there is more than 

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:25.440
 difficulties but it's quite 

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:27.120
 normal we evolve in training you 

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:29.010
 to say that in two years if everything happens 

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:31.170
 well between professionals so and 

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:33.720
 a lot of responsibilities I 'm a 

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:34.170
 internship is to me guillaume falling wood 

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:37.500
 Guillaume 

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:39.390
 with in internal medicine it's my 

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:41.760
 first internship in a hospital and 

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:43.890
 frankly I loved it so I spent 

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:44.900
 first three weeks with the 

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:49.290
 caregivers 

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:52.980
 So I did a lot of toilet 

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:57.300
 changing meals that much loved 

00:02:52.980 --> 00:03:01.410
 also and so after I spent with the 

00:02:57.300 --> 00:03:03.520
 nurses so for the sole and finally 

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:08.200
 injections and 

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:10.360
 treatment I was able to manipulate I do 

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:13.630
 everything and then ben look if I'm doing well 

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:15.900
 but otherwise I do everything it's over at 

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:18.730
 theoretical level that I have trouble 

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:21.040
 there are many things to learn 

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:23.320
 so everything accumulates but otherwise it goes I 

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:25.630
 returned for three weeks of classes 

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:28.690
 including the partial ones and a week of 

00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:29.710
 catching up if I caught up with it we're going 

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:31.660
 cross your fingers and make work 

00:03:29.710 --> 00:03:33.430
 when we are in ehpad of course it's 

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:36.760
 a lot at the beginning hygiene care and 

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:38.530
 comfort but let's say that's the 

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:40.090
 third stage we also feel that there is 

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:42.310
 things that are being put in place we have 

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:43.900
 learned things here since September 

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:45.520
 so there are the procedures of care in 

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:47.050
 sailboat led a little bit that's it 

00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:49.140
 everything starts to build and 

00:03:47.050 --> 00:03:51.640
 I would not like it to be reassuring but 

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:52.810
 that's when we reconvert from a 

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:54.040
 also need to feel that there are 

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:56.650
 things that get put in place 

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:58.600
 the relationship with notation yes me it's 

00:03:56.650 --> 00:04:00.310
 what really what I love so and 

00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:02.350
 then bah we easily see their turn 

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:03.360
 because here they are smiling 

00:04:02.350 --> 00:04:05.620
 touch so 

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:08.410
 so yes no that's clear it's 

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:10.209
 really a crucial point for me and 

00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:12.430
 then with the team at sian there is the 

00:04:10.209 --> 00:04:13.720
 relationship of course with the resident because 

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:15.850
 that we are not from these two regions 

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:17.700
 and then bah the care team that was 

00:04:15.850 --> 00:04:20.470
 really very very welcoming 

00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:22.030
 so here I am very happy then 

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:23.440
 finally the year it still goes 

00:04:22.030 --> 00:04:25.210
 relatively fast because we think 

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:26.770
 that when we commit to three years 

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:29.230
 seems long but in the end 

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:30.760
 is called we are already late May so so 

00:04:29.230 --> 00:04:32.260
 it's passing quickly 

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:33.790
 after that it was still 15 years 

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:35.710
 who was working so it's true he has 

00:04:33.790 --> 00:04:37.690
 I had to recover 

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:40.390
 here in the bath of studies it is necessary 

00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:41.920
 find a good pace and then good balance sheet 

00:04:40.390 --> 00:04:44.260
 so I do not regret my 

00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:46.720
 reconversion so that's the meaning 

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:48.100
 now I wanted to give my life 

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:50.290
 professional so you have to be 

00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:52.540
 patient things get put in place 

00:04:50.290 --> 00:04:54.610
 and so now I have a hurry 

00:04:52.540 --> 00:04:57.900
 it's to succeed in the second semester 

00:04:54.610 --> 00:04:57.900
 to go into second year 

00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:05.449
 here
