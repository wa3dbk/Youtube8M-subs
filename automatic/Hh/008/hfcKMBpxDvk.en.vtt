00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320 
creepypasta has been making in this like

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:41.330 
creepypasta has been making in this like
his<00:01:40.470> spring-trap<00:01:40.890> his<00:01:41.040> version<00:01:41.159> of

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 
his spring-trap his version of

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:42.380 
his spring-trap his version of
spring-trap<00:01:41.729> which<00:01:41.880> actually<00:01:42.119> they<00:01:42.210> just

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
spring-trap which actually they just

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:43.940 
spring-trap which actually they just
cover<00:01:42.570> a<00:01:42.689> couple<00:01:42.810> of<00:01:42.960> hours<00:01:43.229> ago<00:01:43.350> to<00:01:43.470> be<00:01:43.649> honest

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950 
cover a couple of hours ago to be honest

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:46.910 
cover a couple of hours ago to be honest
it<00:01:44.490> doesn't<00:01:44.909> look<00:01:45.240> too<00:01:45.570> much<00:01:45.780> how<00:01:46.380> this<00:01:46.619> ring

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:46.920 
it doesn't look too much how this ring

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:48.350 
it doesn't look too much how this ring
trap<00:01:47.159> would<00:01:47.399> look<00:01:47.640> but<00:01:47.850> I<00:01:47.880> do<00:01:47.970> believe<00:01:48.149> that

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:48.360 
trap would look but I do believe that

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:49.940 
trap would look but I do believe that
this<00:01:48.479> mouth<00:01:48.689> might<00:01:49.320> actually<00:01:49.619> be

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:49.950 
this mouth might actually be

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:51.260 
this mouth might actually be
springtrap's<00:01:50.579> mouth<00:01:50.850> now<00:01:51.000> we're<00:01:51.119> going<00:01:51.210> to

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:51.270 
springtrap's mouth now we're going to

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:52.999

00:02:00.139 --> 00:02:00.149 
animatronic skin is the Kane over there

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:01.280 
animatronic skin is the Kane over there
you<00:02:00.240> can<00:02:00.329> see<00:02:00.450> it's<00:02:00.570> definitely<00:02:00.630> a<00:02:00.899> it's<00:02:01.200> a

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:01.290 
you can see it's definitely a it's a

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:02.990 
you can see it's definitely a it's a
pretty<00:02:01.409> old<00:02:01.619> animatronic<00:02:02.280> right<00:02:02.790> here<00:02:02.939> it

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:03.000 
pretty old animatronic right here it

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.270 
pretty old animatronic right here it
says<00:02:03.119> nightmares<00:02:03.689> come<00:02:04.079> true<00:02:04.110> and<00:02:04.680> there<00:02:05.130> is<00:02:05.250> a

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:06.540 
little bit of a face right here people

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:08.809 
little bit of a face right here people
are<00:02:06.689> speculating<00:02:07.350> that<00:02:07.649> this<00:02:08.220> space<00:02:08.459> or<00:02:08.670> this

00:02:08.809 --> 00:02:08.819

00:02:17.119 --> 00:02:17.129 
other animatronics I would say so maybe

00:02:17.129 --> 00:02:18.710 
other animatronics I would say so maybe
that<00:02:17.310> is<00:02:17.340> Balloon<00:02:17.730> Boy<00:02:17.760> I<00:02:18.150> don't<00:02:18.420> know<00:02:18.510> guys

shop<00:02:47.340> in<00:02:47.519> general<00:02:47.849> I<00:02:47.910> mean<00:02:47.940> we're<00:02:48.180> speculating

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:48.450 
shop in general I mean we're speculating

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:50.449 
shop in general I mean we're speculating
that's<00:02:48.900> a<00:02:48.959> shop<00:02:49.170> I<00:02:49.379> don't<00:02:49.920> think<00:02:50.069> it's<00:02:50.160> a<00:02:50.250> shop

00:02:50.449 --> 00:02:50.459 
that's a shop I don't think it's a shop

that's a shop I don't think it's a shop
guys<00:02:50.700> I<00:02:50.730> think<00:02:51.000> it's<00:02:51.090> actually<00:02:51.209> just<00:02:51.480> the

00:02:51.559 --> 00:02:51.569 
guys I think it's actually just the

00:02:51.569 --> 00:02:53.000 
guys I think it's actually just the
movie<00:02:51.900> set<00:02:52.170> like<00:02:52.319> where<00:02:52.470> they're<00:02:52.620> building

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:53.010 
movie set like where they're building

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:54.650 
movie set like where they're building
all<00:02:53.099> the<00:02:53.220> animatronics<00:02:53.489> and<00:02:54.120> I<00:02:54.299> think<00:02:54.450> this<00:02:54.540> is

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:54.660 
all the animatronics and I think this is

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:56.839 
all the animatronics and I think this is
actually<00:02:54.930> the<00:02:55.019> exact<00:02:55.379> same<00:02:55.650> room<00:02:55.980> as<00:02:56.220> that
