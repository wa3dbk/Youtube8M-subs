00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:22.080 
about the AI is too difficult or it's

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:24.140 
about the AI is too difficult or it's
way<00:00:22.350> too<00:00:22.410> easy<00:00:22.560> I<00:00:23.070> I<00:00:23.130> have<00:00:23.670> a<00:00:23.699> hard<00:00:23.970> time

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:24.150 
way too easy I I have a hard time

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:28.370 
way too easy I I have a hard time
finding<00:00:25.140> a<00:00:25.170> good<00:00:25.410> balance<00:00:26.539> to<00:00:27.539> try<00:00:28.080> to<00:00:28.140> make<00:00:28.320> a

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:28.380 
finding a good balance to try to make a

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:30.380 
finding a good balance to try to make a
good<00:00:28.650> balance<00:00:28.980> I've<00:00:29.220> actually<00:00:29.789> made<00:00:30.029> it<00:00:30.179> so

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:30.390 
good balance I've actually made it so

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:37.610 
good balance I've actually made it so
that<00:00:30.420> the<00:00:32.510> the<00:00:33.510> AI<00:00:35.540> you<00:00:36.540> can<00:00:36.750> add<00:00:36.930> like<00:00:37.170> fog<00:00:37.469> of

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:37.620 
that the the AI you can add like fog of

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:39.260 
that the the AI you can add like fog of
war<00:00:37.649> so<00:00:38.040> you<00:00:38.100> can't<00:00:38.340> see<00:00:38.550> what's<00:00:38.790> happening

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:39.270 
war so you can't see what's happening

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:43.369 
war so you can't see what's happening
outside<00:00:39.750> of<00:00:40.110> your<00:00:40.260> borders<00:00:40.710> on<00:00:41.399> the<00:00:42.379> countries

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379 
outside of your borders on the countries

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:46.549 
outside of your borders on the countries
that<00:00:43.410> are<00:00:43.620> in<00:00:43.680> more<00:00:44.280> than<00:00:44.370> one<00:00:45.079> territory<00:00:46.079> away

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:46.559 
that are in more than one territory away

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:49.459 
that are in more than one territory away
that's<00:00:47.129> kind<00:00:47.340> of<00:00:47.399> fun<00:00:47.719> I<00:00:48.719> actually

00:00:49.459 --> 00:00:49.469 
that's kind of fun I actually

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:51.110 
that's kind of fun I actually
implemented<00:00:50.219> that<00:00:50.309> and<00:00:50.489> I<00:00:50.550> saw<00:00:50.730> some<00:00:50.969> of<00:00:51.059> the

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 
implemented that and I saw some of the

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:52.400 
implemented that and I saw some of the
other<00:00:51.239> people<00:00:51.449> that<00:00:51.600> I<00:00:51.780> used<00:00:51.809> to<00:00:52.020> play<00:00:52.170> their

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410 
other people that I used to play their

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:55.189 
other people that I used to play their
games<00:00:52.940> copy<00:00:53.940> and<00:00:54.180> I<00:00:54.239> implement<00:00:54.660> that<00:00:54.780> into

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
games copy and I implement that into

00:00:55.199 --> 00:01:00.650 
games copy and I implement that into
theirs<00:00:55.670> so<00:00:56.670> I<00:00:56.699> guess<00:00:57.180> it's<00:00:57.360> a<00:00:57.600> good<00:00:57.690> idea<00:00:59.660> it's

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
theirs so I guess it's a good idea it's

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:03.080 
theirs so I guess it's a good idea it's
anyway<00:01:01.590> let<00:01:01.770> me<00:01:01.800> see<00:01:02.370> if<00:01:02.460> I<00:01:02.520> can't<00:01:02.730> get<00:01:02.850> one<00:01:03.000> of

anyway let me see if I can't get one of

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:05.690 
anyway let me see if I can't get one of
these<00:01:03.180> two<00:01:03.420> middle<00:01:03.750> territories<00:01:04.379> or<00:01:04.700> heck

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
these two middle territories or heck

right where I'm at I don't usually get a

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:11.929 
right where I'm at I don't usually get a
chance<00:01:09.330> at<00:01:09.540> this<00:01:10.549> continent<00:01:11.549> right<00:01:11.729> off<00:01:11.909> of

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:55.070 
follow by a nice losing streak since we

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:57.370 
follow by a nice losing streak since we
defeated<00:01:55.220> green<00:01:55.700> we<00:01:55.910> got<00:01:56.090> I<00:01:56.390> think<00:01:56.960> it<00:01:57.020> was<00:01:57.110> for

00:01:57.370 --> 00:01:57.380

extra armies 3 is about the minimum i
want<00:02:02.390> to<00:02:02.479> keep<00:02:02.660> it<00:02:02.870> as<00:02:03.080> a<00:02:03.140> defensive<00:02:03.920> line<00:02:04.160> so

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:04.520 
want to keep it as a defensive line so

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:07.889 
want to keep it as a defensive line so
I'm<00:02:04.820> going<00:02:05.150> to<00:02:05.180> hold<00:02:05.360> off<00:02:05.479> there<00:02:06.130> heck

00:02:07.889 --> 00:02:07.899 
I'm going to hold off there heck

00:02:07.899 --> 00:02:12.090 
I'm going to hold off there heck
Nessie's<00:02:08.899> right<00:02:09.140> off<00:02:09.290> the<00:02:09.470> tip<00:02:09.679> of<00:02:09.710> that

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:12.100 

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:16.110 

Island<00:02:13.100> up<00:02:13.220> there<00:02:13.400> to<00:02:13.490> the<00:02:13.520> north<00:02:13.820> kind<00:02:14.120> of<00:02:14.180> fun

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:16.120 
Island up there to the north kind of fun

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:23.490 
Island up there to the north kind of fun
my<00:02:17.120> artists<00:02:17.540> created<00:02:18.020> that<00:02:20.980> all<00:02:21.980> right<00:02:22.340> I

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:23.500 
my artists created that all right I

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:27.850 
my artists created that all right I
think<00:02:24.500> we<00:02:24.620> can<00:02:24.770> take<00:02:24.920> the<00:02:25.100> middle<00:02:25.340> here<00:02:26.860> I'll

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:27.860 
think we can take the middle here I'll

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:30.130 
think we can take the middle here I'll
break<00:02:28.070> that<00:02:28.280> in<00:02:28.400> half<00:02:28.430> move<00:02:29.300> all<00:02:29.600> to<00:02:29.810> the<00:02:29.930> side

00:04:58.909 --> 00:04:58.919 
doing a 50-50 chance that's what happens

00:04:58.919 --> 00:05:02.270 
doing a 50-50 chance that's what happens
that's<00:04:59.400> what<00:04:59.640> it<00:04:59.790> is<00:04:59.820> by<00:05:00.390> default<00:05:00.600> in<00:05:01.050> here<00:05:01.410> it

00:05:02.270 --> 00:05:02.280 
that's what it is by default in here it

00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:04.750 
that's what it is by default in here it
also<00:05:02.430> means<00:05:02.700> you<00:05:02.940> can<00:05:03.090> have<00:05:03.300> win<00:05:03.570> win<00:05:03.750> win<00:05:03.780> win

but if you don't like that you can
