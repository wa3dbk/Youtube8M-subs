well<00:03:42.480> we<00:03:42.630> were<00:03:42.750> completely<00:03:43.230> wrong<00:03:43.490> this<00:03:44.490> is

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:44.670 
well we were completely wrong this is

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:59.720 
well we were completely wrong this is
the<00:03:44.850> mother<00:03:45.090> with<00:03:45.390> the<00:03:45.480> six<00:03:45.780> cups

00:03:59.720 --> 00:03:59.730 

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:02.699 

how<00:04:00.730> on<00:04:00.939> earth<00:04:01.239> they've<00:04:01.659> all<00:04:01.840> fitted<00:04:02.349> in<00:04:02.500> that

00:04:02.699 --> 00:04:02.709 
how on earth they've all fitted in that

00:04:02.709 --> 00:04:15.350 
how on earth they've all fitted in that
small<00:04:03.099> bush<00:04:03.400> I<00:04:03.730> have<00:04:04.120> no<00:04:04.540> idea

00:04:15.350 --> 00:04:15.360 

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:18.479 

it's<00:04:16.360> so<00:04:16.660> good<00:04:16.989> to<00:04:17.230> see<00:04:17.260> this<00:04:17.650> mother<00:04:17.950> with<00:04:18.220> six

00:04:18.479 --> 00:04:18.489

cups

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:19.350

sadly<00:04:20.350> the<00:04:20.530> mortality<00:04:20.980> rate<00:04:21.489> in<00:04:21.730> cheetah<00:04:22.060> cubs

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:22.450 
sadly the mortality rate in cheetah cubs

00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:25.800 
sadly the mortality rate in cheetah cubs
is<00:04:22.660> very<00:04:22.990> high<00:04:23.400> if<00:04:24.400> she<00:04:24.730> can<00:04:24.940> raise<00:04:25.120> four<00:04:25.630> of

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:25.810 
is very high if she can raise four of

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:28.500 
is very high if she can raise four of
them<00:04:25.990> to<00:04:26.440> adulthood<00:04:26.980> that<00:04:27.490> would<00:04:27.670> be<00:04:27.820> amazing

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:28.510 
them to adulthood that would be amazing

00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:31.110 
them to adulthood that would be amazing
but<00:04:29.260> it's<00:04:29.440> more<00:04:29.680> likely<00:04:30.010> she'll<00:04:30.460> raise<00:04:30.700> just

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:31.120 
but it's more likely she'll raise just

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:59.520 
but it's more likely she'll raise just
two<00:04:31.480> maybe<00:04:32.290> three

00:04:59.520 --> 00:04:59.530 

00:04:59.530 --> 00:05:02.200 

she's<00:05:00.530> done<00:05:00.740> incredibly<00:05:01.310> well<00:05:01.430> to<00:05:01.910> have<00:05:02.030> not

00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:02.210 
she's done incredibly well to have not

00:05:02.210 --> 00:05:05.380 
she's done incredibly well to have not
lost<00:05:02.450> a<00:05:02.660> couple<00:05:02.870> ready<00:05:03.520> we<00:05:04.520> can<00:05:04.700> only<00:05:05.000> but<00:05:05.180> wish

00:05:05.380 --> 00:05:05.390 
lost a couple ready we can only but wish

00:05:05.390 --> 00:05:08.770 
lost a couple ready we can only but wish
her<00:05:05.570> well<00:05:05.600> for<00:05:05.900> the<00:05:06.290> future
