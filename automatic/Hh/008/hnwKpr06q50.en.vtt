you<00:01:30.090> get<00:01:30.240> kills<00:01:30.509> with<00:01:30.689> it<00:01:30.840> or<00:01:30.990> when<00:01:31.290> you

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 
you get kills with it or when you

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:33.230 
you get kills with it or when you
capture<00:01:31.799> an<00:01:31.860> objective<00:01:32.340> while<00:01:32.549> holding<00:01:32.820> it<00:01:33.060> or

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
capture an objective while holding it or

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:34.609 
capture an objective while holding it or
stuff<00:01:33.479> like<00:01:33.600> that<00:01:33.659> when<00:01:33.960> you<00:01:34.079> get<00:01:34.200> points<00:01:34.380> with

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:34.619 
stuff like that when you get points with

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:36.410 
stuff like that when you get points with
your<00:01:34.740> weapon<00:01:35.100> you<00:01:35.490> rank<00:01:35.729> it<00:01:35.939> up<00:01:36.090> and<00:01:36.299> that's

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
your weapon you rank it up and that's

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:38.120 
your weapon you rank it up and that's
how<00:01:36.630> you<00:01:36.689> get<00:01:36.840> bonuses<00:01:37.409> for<00:01:37.590> it<00:01:37.740> so<00:01:37.979> that's

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.130 
how you get bonuses for it so that's

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:40.100 
how you get bonuses for it so that's
pretty<00:01:38.310> cool<00:01:38.400> now<00:01:39.180> this<00:01:39.329> next<00:01:39.509> guy<00:01:39.720> brings<00:01:39.990> up

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
pretty cool now this next guy brings up

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:41.420 
pretty cool now this next guy brings up
a<00:01:40.170> pretty<00:01:40.350> good<00:01:40.439> point<00:01:40.710> and<00:01:40.950> the<00:01:41.070> fact<00:01:41.280> that

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:41.430 
a pretty good point and the fact that

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:43.219 
a pretty good point and the fact that
since<00:01:41.790> we<00:01:41.909> no<00:01:42.090> longer<00:01:42.119> have<00:01:42.630> to<00:01:42.720> get<00:01:42.869> camos

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:43.229 
since we no longer have to get camos

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:44.690 
since we no longer have to get camos
through<00:01:43.470> getting<00:01:43.619> headshots<00:01:43.890> like<00:01:44.369> we<00:01:44.490> saw<00:01:44.670> in

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
through getting headshots like we saw in

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:46.700 
through getting headshots like we saw in
modern<00:01:45.060> warfare<00:01:45.210> 2<00:01:45.600> or<00:01:45.810> in<00:01:46.229> college<00:01:46.530> before

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:46.710 
modern warfare 2 or in college before

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:48.590 
modern warfare 2 or in college before
that's<00:01:47.399> going<00:01:47.549> to<00:01:47.610> dramatically<00:01:48.119> reduce<00:01:48.360> the

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600 
that's going to dramatically reduce the

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:50.569 
that's going to dramatically reduce the
amount<00:01:48.930> of<00:01:49.049> boosting<00:01:49.470> in<00:01:49.560> the<00:01:49.619> game<00:01:49.799> as<00:01:49.950> well

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:50.579 
amount of boosting in the game as well

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:52.969 
amount of boosting in the game as well
as<00:01:50.790> the<00:01:50.939> nuke<00:01:51.210> is<00:01:51.450> gone<00:01:51.630> so<00:01:51.930> nuke<00:01:52.470> boosting<00:01:52.890> in

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979 
as the nuke is gone so nuke boosting in

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:55.370 
as the nuke is gone so nuke boosting in
modern<00:01:53.159> warfare<00:01:53.280> 2<00:01:53.579> was<00:01:53.790> huge<00:01:54.420> since<00:01:55.170> that's

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:55.380 
modern warfare 2 was huge since that's

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:57.139 
modern warfare 2 was huge since that's
gone<00:01:55.619> since<00:01:56.009> you<00:01:56.159> will<00:01:56.280> no<00:01:56.460> longer<00:01:56.490> get<00:01:56.909> head

00:01:57.139 --> 00:01:57.149 
gone since you will no longer get head

00:01:57.149 --> 00:01:58.819 
gone since you will no longer get head
shots<00:01:57.180> from<00:01:57.600> boosting<00:01:57.990> I<00:01:58.140> don't<00:01:58.649> think

00:01:58.819 --> 00:01:58.829 
shots from boosting I don't think

00:01:58.829 --> 00:01:59.959 
shots from boosting I don't think
boosters<00:01:59.159> are<00:01:59.340> really<00:01:59.549> going<00:01:59.640> to<00:01:59.729> have<00:01:59.820> much

00:01:59.959 --> 00:01:59.969 
boosters are really going to have much

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:01.639 
boosters are really going to have much
of<00:02:00.000> an<00:02:00.240> incentive<00:02:00.360> to<00:02:00.689> boost<00:02:01.079> so<00:02:01.350> that's<00:02:01.530> going

00:02:01.639 --> 00:02:01.649 
of an incentive to boost so that's going

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:02.840 
of an incentive to boost so that's going
to<00:02:01.740> reduce<00:02:01.860> the<00:02:02.130> boosting<00:02:02.460> that's<00:02:02.670> going<00:02:02.790> to

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:02.850 
to reduce the boosting that's going to

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:04.940 
to reduce the boosting that's going to
be<00:02:02.939> awesome<00:02:03.090> I<00:02:03.360> can't<00:02:03.420> wait<00:02:03.719> for<00:02:04.110> it<00:02:04.140> moving<00:02:04.860> on

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:04.950 
be awesome I can't wait for it moving on

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:06.200 
be awesome I can't wait for it moving on
to<00:02:05.009> the<00:02:05.070> next<00:02:05.130> week<00:02:05.520> this<00:02:05.729> guy<00:02:05.820> is<00:02:05.939> asking

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:06.210 
to the next week this guy is asking

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:08.300 
to the next week this guy is asking
about<00:02:06.540> crazy<00:02:07.020> challenges<00:02:07.740> in<00:02:07.920> modern<00:02:08.250> warfare

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:08.310 
about crazy challenges in modern warfare

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:09.919 
about crazy challenges in modern warfare
3<00:02:08.610> and<00:02:08.970> if<00:02:09.030> they're<00:02:09.149> going<00:02:09.239> to<00:02:09.330> have<00:02:09.509> any<00:02:09.750> and

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:09.929 
3 and if they're going to have any and

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:11.990 
3 and if they're going to have any and
Robert<00:02:10.470> Bowling<00:02:10.619> replies<00:02:11.009> we're<00:02:11.489> introducing

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:12.000 
Robert Bowling replies we're introducing

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:13.220 
Robert Bowling replies we're introducing
new<00:02:12.150> challenges<00:02:12.629> all<00:02:12.840> the<00:02:12.959> time

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:13.230 
new challenges all the time

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:14.780 
new challenges all the time
in<00:02:13.260> the<00:02:13.349> game<00:02:13.530> now<00:02:13.560> with<00:02:13.980> daily<00:02:14.370> and<00:02:14.550> weekly

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:14.790 
in the game now with daily and weekly

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:16.850 
in the game now with daily and weekly
challenges<00:02:15.510> so<00:02:15.780> what<00:02:16.260> does<00:02:16.319> that<00:02:16.379> sound<00:02:16.709> like

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:16.860 
challenges so what does that sound like

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:18.890 
challenges so what does that sound like
it<00:02:17.159> sounds<00:02:17.640> like<00:02:17.730> contracts<00:02:18.299> from<00:02:18.420> black<00:02:18.659> ops

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:18.900 
it sounds like contracts from black ops

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:20.690 
it sounds like contracts from black ops
so<00:02:19.140> that<00:02:19.530> is<00:02:19.650> awesome<00:02:19.830> they're<00:02:20.220> taking<00:02:20.459> a<00:02:20.519> page

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:20.700 
so that is awesome they're taking a page

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:22.280 
so that is awesome they're taking a page
at<00:02:20.849> a<00:02:20.879> tray<00:02:21.120> arcs<00:02:21.330> book<00:02:21.540> and<00:02:21.720> it's<00:02:21.840> a<00:02:21.900> good<00:02:22.110> page

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:22.290 
at a tray arcs book and it's a good page

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:23.690 
at a tray arcs book and it's a good page
to<00:02:22.500> take<00:02:22.680> because<00:02:23.010> those<00:02:23.220> things<00:02:23.400> keep<00:02:23.670> the

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:23.700 
to take because those things keep the

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:25.399 
to take because those things keep the
game<00:02:23.940> fresh<00:02:23.970> they<00:02:24.480> give<00:02:24.629> you<00:02:24.690> fun<00:02:24.900> stuff<00:02:25.140> to<00:02:25.170> do

00:02:25.399 --> 00:02:25.409 
game fresh they give you fun stuff to do

00:02:25.409 --> 00:02:27.800 
game fresh they give you fun stuff to do
and<00:02:25.590> I<00:02:26.250> think<00:02:26.280> that<00:02:26.580> was<00:02:26.670> a<00:02:26.700> good<00:02:26.849> move<00:02:27.060> now<00:02:27.750> the

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:27.810 
and I think that was a good move now the

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:29.390 
and I think that was a good move now the
next<00:02:27.989> tweet<00:02:28.260> here<00:02:28.530> is<00:02:28.680> asking<00:02:29.069> about<00:02:29.250> the

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:29.400 
next tweet here is asking about the

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:31.100 
next tweet here is asking about the
level<00:02:29.730> cap<00:02:29.910> in<00:02:30.090> modern<00:02:30.360> warfare<00:02:30.420> 3<00:02:30.660> so<00:02:30.989> the

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:31.110 
level cap in modern warfare 3 so the

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:33.140 
level cap in modern warfare 3 so the
highest<00:02:31.500> level<00:02:31.920> on<00:02:32.099> the<00:02:32.220> prestigious<00:02:32.730> is<00:02:32.910> 80

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:33.150 
highest level on the prestigious is 80

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:34.820 
highest level on the prestigious is 80
so<00:02:33.420> you<00:02:33.480> get<00:02:33.660> up<00:02:33.750> to<00:02:33.870> level<00:02:34.019> 80<00:02:34.290> then<00:02:34.560> you<00:02:34.709> can

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:34.830 
so you get up to level 80 then you can

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:36.619 
so you get up to level 80 then you can
prestige<00:02:35.190> and<00:02:35.430> do<00:02:35.519> it<00:02:35.640> all<00:02:35.760> again<00:02:35.790> and<00:02:36.239> he's

00:02:36.619 --> 00:02:36.629 
prestige and do it all again and he's

00:02:36.629 --> 00:02:38.210 
prestige and do it all again and he's
asking<00:02:37.019> is<00:02:37.170> it<00:02:37.260> going<00:02:37.379> to<00:02:37.440> be<00:02:37.530> easier<00:02:37.890> to<00:02:37.920> rank

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:38.220 
asking is it going to be easier to rank

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:40.160 
asking is it going to be easier to rank
up<00:02:38.400> or<00:02:38.610> is<00:02:39.030> it<00:02:39.120> going<00:02:39.209> to<00:02:39.269> take<00:02:39.420> less<00:02:39.660> time<00:02:39.780> and

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:40.170 
up or is it going to take less time and

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:42.020 
up or is it going to take less time and
Robert<00:02:40.709> Bowling<00:02:40.890> replies<00:02:41.220> the<00:02:41.640> curve<00:02:41.910> is

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:42.030 
Robert Bowling replies the curve is

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:44.059 
Robert Bowling replies the curve is
different<00:02:42.510> and<00:02:42.599> less<00:02:42.840> of<00:02:42.900> a<00:02:43.079> grind<00:02:43.470> at<00:02:43.709> the<00:02:43.860> end

00:02:44.059 --> 00:02:44.069 
different and less of a grind at the end

00:02:44.069 --> 00:02:45.890 
different and less of a grind at the end
than<00:02:44.400> it<00:02:44.519> was<00:02:44.670> a<00:02:44.700> modern<00:02:45.060> warfare<00:02:45.209> 2<00:02:45.510> so<00:02:45.750> that

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:45.900 
than it was a modern warfare 2 so that

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:47.569 
than it was a modern warfare 2 so that
