I'm actually pretty interested to see
what<00:00:37.790> this<00:00:37.940> plate<00:00:38.270> is<00:00:38.450> going<00:00:38.630> to<00:00:38.720> look<00:00:38.900> like

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:38.930 
what this plate is going to look like

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:41.500 
what this plate is going to look like
this<00:00:39.890> car<00:00:40.250> just<00:00:40.280> passed<00:00:40.700> a<00:00:40.880> hundred<00:00:41.180> thousand

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:41.510 
this car just passed a hundred thousand

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:43.750 
this car just passed a hundred thousand
miles<00:00:41.720> and<00:00:42.140> to<00:00:43.070> the<00:00:43.190> best<00:00:43.400> of<00:00:43.610> my<00:00:43.730> knowledge

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:43.760 
miles and to the best of my knowledge

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:46.680 
miles and to the best of my knowledge
has<00:00:44.270> never<00:00:44.300> had<00:00:44.750> the<00:00:44.900> EGR<00:00:45.200> cake<00:00:45.560> plate<00:00:45.950> Queen

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:46.690 
has never had the EGR cake plate Queen

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:50.530 
has never had the EGR cake plate Queen
so<00:00:47.690> we'll<00:00:48.290> see<00:00:48.880> so<00:00:49.880> now<00:00:49.910> you're<00:00:50.180> just<00:00:50.210> going<00:00:50.480> to

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:50.540 
so we'll see so now you're just going to

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:55.810 
so we'll see so now you're just going to
evenly<00:00:51.260> pull<00:00:51.620> this<00:00:51.770> back<00:00:54.340> light<00:00:55.340> it<00:00:55.489> off<00:00:55.610> the

00:00:55.810 --> 00:00:55.820 
evenly pull this back light it off the

00:00:55.820 --> 00:01:06.980 
evenly pull this back light it off the
studs

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:11.100 

and<00:01:07.470> then<00:01:07.680> from<00:01:07.979> there

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:11.110 

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:12.900 

should<00:01:11.410> be<00:01:11.560> able<00:01:11.770> to<00:01:11.860> do<00:01:11.980> the<00:01:12.100> same<00:01:12.340> thing<00:01:12.670> with

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:12.910 
should be able to do the same thing with

00:01:12.910 --> 00:01:15.450 
should be able to do the same thing with
the<00:01:13.090> plate<00:01:13.360> itself<00:01:13.810> let<00:01:14.800> me<00:01:14.890> see<00:01:15.070> if<00:01:15.160> I<00:01:15.250> can<00:01:15.370> get

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:15.460 
the plate itself let me see if I can get

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:47.190 
the plate itself let me see if I can get
a<00:01:15.490> better<00:01:15.700> view<00:01:15.940> here

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:47.200 

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:49.200 

okay

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:49.210 
okay

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:50.820 
okay
so<00:01:49.780> now<00:01:49.930> you<00:01:49.990> just<00:01:50.320> kind<00:01:50.530> of<00:01:50.590> keep<00:01:50.770> some

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:50.830 
so now you just kind of keep some

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:55.460 
so now you just kind of keep some
tension<00:01:51.430> on<00:01:51.520> this<00:01:52.350> you're<00:01:53.350> going<00:01:53.470> to<00:01:53.560> want<00:01:53.830> to

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:55.470 
tension on this you're going to want to

00:01:55.470 --> 00:02:01.880 
tension on this you're going to want to
wiggle<00:01:56.470> the<00:01:56.770> plate<00:01:57.010> off

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:01.890 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:04.370 

keep<00:02:02.460> it<00:02:02.640> straight<00:02:02.969> so<00:02:03.240> it<00:02:03.329> comes<00:02:03.509> off<00:02:03.750> evenly

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:04.380 
keep it straight so it comes off evenly

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:08.330 
keep it straight so it comes off evenly
doesn't<00:02:06.049> mess<00:02:07.049> with<00:02:07.079> any<00:02:07.469> of<00:02:07.560> the<00:02:07.740> threads<00:02:08.039> on

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:08.340 
doesn't mess with any of the threads on

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:17.280 
doesn't mess with any of the threads on
the<00:02:08.429> studs

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:17.290 

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:22.050 

so<00:02:18.150> you<00:02:19.150> can<00:02:19.330> see<00:02:19.569> here<00:02:19.900> that<00:02:20.519> is<00:02:21.519> the<00:02:21.700> EGR

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:22.060 
so you can see here that is the EGR

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:25.530 
so you can see here that is the EGR
plate<00:02:23.220> not<00:02:24.220> actually<00:02:24.730> quite<00:02:24.939> as<00:02:25.060> bad<00:02:25.269> as<00:02:25.299> I

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:25.540 
plate not actually quite as bad as I

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:29.970 
plate not actually quite as bad as I
expected<00:02:25.659> but<00:02:26.400> very<00:02:27.400> oily<00:02:28.620> which<00:02:29.620> doesn't

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:29.980 
expected but very oily which doesn't

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:34.080 
expected but very oily which doesn't
make<00:02:30.069> me<00:02:30.220> too<00:02:30.849> terribly<00:02:31.180> happy<00:02:32.430> so<00:02:33.430> we'll<00:02:33.879> set

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:34.090 
make me too terribly happy so we'll set

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:36.839 
make me too terribly happy so we'll set
that<00:02:34.120> aside<00:02:34.269> for<00:02:34.510> now<00:02:34.780> and<00:02:35.680> we're<00:02:36.489> also<00:02:36.610> going

00:02:36.839 --> 00:02:36.849 
that aside for now and we're also going

00:02:36.849 --> 00:02:41.220 
that aside for now and we're also going
to<00:02:36.940> want<00:02:37.090> to<00:02:37.120> take<00:02:37.299> off<00:02:37.480> the<00:02:37.690> gasket<00:02:38.290> and<00:02:40.200> put<00:02:41.200> a

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:41.230 
to want to take off the gasket and put a

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:45.180 
to want to take off the gasket and put a
new<00:02:41.470> one<00:02:41.620> on<00:02:41.680> there<00:02:42.040> and<00:02:43.560> that<00:02:44.560> minimum<00:02:44.920> you're

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:45.190 
new one on there and that minimum you're

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:46.860 
new one on there and that minimum you're

00:03:01.289 --> 00:03:01.299 
can see there's some deposits buildup in

00:03:01.299 --> 00:03:03.509 
can see there's some deposits buildup in
there<00:03:01.450> I'd<00:03:02.109> recommend<00:03:02.620> using<00:03:02.799> a<00:03:03.040> wire<00:03:03.220> brush

00:03:03.509 --> 00:03:03.519 
there I'd recommend using a wire brush

00:03:03.519 --> 00:03:06.360 
there I'd recommend using a wire brush
maybe<00:03:03.849> some<00:03:04.090> carb<00:03:04.299> cleaner<00:03:04.859> even<00:03:05.859> of<00:03:05.980> that<00:03:06.159> him

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:06.370 
maybe some carb cleaner even of that him

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:07.920 
maybe some carb cleaner even of that him
to<00:03:06.519> vacuum<00:03:06.879> out<00:03:06.970> any<00:03:07.150> sediment<00:03:07.450> you<00:03:07.659> really

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:07.930 
to vacuum out any sediment you really

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:09.089 
to vacuum out any sediment you really
don't<00:03:08.109> want<00:03:08.260> to<00:03:08.290> suck<00:03:08.530> that<00:03:08.709> up<00:03:08.859> into<00:03:09.040> your

00:03:09.089 --> 00:03:09.099 
don't want to suck that up into your

00:03:09.099 --> 00:03:13.170 
don't want to suck that up into your
intake<00:03:09.459> not<00:03:10.450> a<00:03:10.510> good<00:03:10.750> idea<00:03:10.900> so<00:03:11.670> in<00:03:12.670> part<00:03:12.909> three

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:13.180 
intake not a good idea so in part three

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:15.479 
intake not a good idea so in part three
I<00:03:13.209> will<00:03:13.480> show<00:03:13.780> you<00:03:13.840> how<00:03:14.139> to<00:03:14.200> clean<00:03:14.859> the<00:03:15.069> EGR

00:03:15.479 --> 00:03:15.489 
I will show you how to clean the EGR

00:03:15.489 --> 00:03:18.239 
I will show you how to clean the EGR
plate<00:03:15.849> itself
