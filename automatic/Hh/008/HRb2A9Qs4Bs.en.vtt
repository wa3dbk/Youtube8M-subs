00:01:52.599 --> 00:01:54.659 
which is very exciting that it's going
to<00:01:52.689> be<00:01:52.779> on<00:01:52.899> this<00:01:53.049> one<00:01:53.259> as<00:01:53.499> well<00:01:53.560> it'll<00:01:54.489> be

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:54.669 
to be on this one as well it'll be

00:01:54.669 --> 00:01:56.279 
to be on this one as well it'll be
available<00:01:54.759> in<00:01:55.090> two<00:01:55.209> different<00:01:55.329> colors<00:01:55.899> black

00:01:56.279 --> 00:01:56.289 
available in two different colors black

00:01:56.289 --> 00:01:59.039 
available in two different colors black
and<00:01:56.529> wine<00:01:57.009> red<00:01:57.340> as<00:01:57.639> they've<00:01:58.299> been<00:01:58.509> calling<00:01:58.809> it

00:01:59.039 --> 00:01:59.049 
and wine red as they've been calling it

00:01:59.049 --> 00:02:01.169 
and wine red as they've been calling it
and<00:01:59.229> in<00:02:00.039> terms<00:02:00.309> of<00:02:00.489> the<00:02:00.579> design<00:02:00.939> is<00:02:01.090> very

00:02:01.169 --> 00:02:01.179 
and in terms of the design is very

00:02:01.179 --> 00:02:05.309 
and in terms of the design is very
similar<00:02:01.599> to<00:02:01.749> Samsung's<00:02:02.700> existing<00:02:03.700> Tizen<00:02:04.329> line

00:02:05.309 --> 00:02:05.319 
similar to Samsung's existing Tizen line

00:02:05.319 --> 00:02:08.550 
similar to Samsung's existing Tizen line
of<00:02:05.590> gear<00:02:06.549> smartwatches<00:02:07.090> and<00:02:07.479> they've<00:02:08.319> pretty

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:08.560 
of gear smartwatches and they've pretty

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:11.160 
of gear smartwatches and they've pretty
much<00:02:08.739> just<00:02:09.009> put<00:02:09.759> Android<00:02:10.239> wear<00:02:10.479> on<00:02:10.719> there<00:02:10.959> and

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:11.170 
much just put Android wear on there and

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:12.680 
much just put Android wear on there and
tweak<00:02:11.709> the<00:02:11.890> design<00:02:11.920> a<00:02:12.250> bit

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:12.690 
tweak the design a bit

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:15.200 
tweak the design a bit
so<00:02:12.810> that's<00:02:13.410> all<00:02:13.770> I<00:02:13.800> can<00:02:14.160> really<00:02:14.460> say<00:02:14.670> about<00:02:14.910> the

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:15.210 
so that's all I can really say about the

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:16.210 
so that's all I can really say about the
design<00:02:15.450> also<00:02:15.660> I<00:02:15.780> want<00:02:15.990> to<00:02:16.050> mention

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:16.220 
design also I want to mention

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:18.350 
design also I want to mention
unfortunately<00:02:17.220> to<00:02:17.400> me<00:02:17.430> I<00:02:17.880> haven't<00:02:18.090> actually

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:18.360 
unfortunately to me I haven't actually

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:20.930 
unfortunately to me I haven't actually
had<00:02:18.810> a<00:02:18.870> chance<00:02:19.320> to<00:02:19.470> look<00:02:19.650> at<00:02:19.800> it<00:02:19.980> but<00:02:20.460> it<00:02:20.580> looks

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:20.940 
had a chance to look at it but it looks

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:24.620 
had a chance to look at it but it looks
very<00:02:21.110> bulky<00:02:22.220> the<00:02:23.220> top<00:02:23.490> part<00:02:23.760> the<00:02:23.850> part<00:02:24.480> where

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:24.630 
very bulky the top part the part where

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:26.810 
very bulky the top part the part where
the<00:02:24.750> display<00:02:25.080> is<00:02:25.260> it<00:02:25.770> just<00:02:26.010> looks<00:02:26.130> very<00:02:26.280> very

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:26.820 
the display is it just looks very very

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:29.600 
the display is it just looks very very
bulky<00:02:27.180> and<00:02:27.630> I'm<00:02:28.350> not<00:02:28.740> sure<00:02:29.070> how<00:02:29.250> that<00:02:29.460> would

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:29.610 
bulky and I'm not sure how that would

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:32.210 
bulky and I'm not sure how that would
actually<00:02:29.640> look<00:02:30.000> on<00:02:30.480> someone's<00:02:31.050> hand<00:02:31.410> but

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:32.220 
actually look on someone's hand but

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:34.640 
actually look on someone's hand but
