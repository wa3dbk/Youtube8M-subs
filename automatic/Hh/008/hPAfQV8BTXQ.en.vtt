a<00:02:41.650> prime<00:02:41.890> example<00:02:41.920> of<00:02:42.430> a<00:02:42.550> zombie<00:02:42.730> game<00:02:43.030> that

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:43.270 
a prime example of a zombie game that

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:44.610 
a prime example of a zombie game that
doesn't<00:02:43.450> have<00:02:43.600> the<00:02:43.660> greatest<00:02:43.990> graphics<00:02:44.500> in

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:47.860 
I'm not saying it's because of the

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:49.980 
I'm not saying it's because of the
limited<00:02:48.280> capabilities<00:02:49.030> a<00:02:49.060> little<00:02:49.300> wii<00:02:49.390> u<00:02:49.600> not

the fact that while it is a first-person

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:03.360 
the fact that while it is a first-person
view<00:03:01.150> very<00:03:01.540> much<00:03:01.720> like<00:03:01.930> zombie<00:03:02.350> you<00:03:02.560> is<00:03:02.770> not<00:03:03.310> a

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:11.410 
there's like they're saying that the

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:13.590 
there's like they're saying that the
best<00:03:11.680> method<00:03:12.190> sometimes<00:03:12.610> is<00:03:12.790> trying<00:03:13.210> to<00:03:13.300> slip

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:13.600 
best method sometimes is trying to slip

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:15.930 
best method sometimes is trying to slip
past<00:03:13.630> those<00:03:14.230> zombies<00:03:14.620> rather<00:03:14.860> than<00:03:15.130> you<00:03:15.880> know

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:15.940 
past those zombies rather than you know

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:19.710 
past those zombies rather than you know
it's<00:03:16.360> not<00:03:16.630> it's<00:03:16.930> not<00:03:17.410> like<00:03:17.520> grabbing<00:03:18.520> an<00:03:18.720> ak-47

00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:19.720 
it's not it's not like grabbing an ak-47

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:21.360 
it's not it's not like grabbing an ak-47
and<00:03:19.810> killing<00:03:20.140> wave<00:03:20.380> after<00:03:20.680> wave<00:03:20.890> of<00:03:21.310> zombies

are<00:03:22.060> availa<00:03:22.540> anyways<00:03:23.500> um<00:03:23.970> but<00:03:24.970> my<00:03:25.180> concern<00:03:25.540> is

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:25.930 
are availa anyways um but my concern is

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:29.910 
are availa anyways um but my concern is

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:29.920 
this they've only really released the

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:33.240 
this they've only really released the
one<00:03:30.160> trailer<00:03:30.960> minimal<00:03:31.960> gameplay<00:03:32.470> is<00:03:32.770> shown

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:33.250 
one trailer minimal gameplay is shown

one trailer minimal gameplay is shown
and<00:03:33.760> I'm<00:03:34.600> just<00:03:34.960> stuff<00:03:35.950> like<00:03:36.040> that<00:03:36.160> makes<00:03:36.700> me

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:37.060 
and I'm just stuff like that makes me

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:39.480 
and I'm just stuff like that makes me
very<00:03:37.210> very<00:03:37.870> nervous<00:03:38.230> we're<00:03:38.710> only<00:03:38.830> weeks<00:03:39.250> away

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:39.490 
very very nervous we're only weeks away

00:03:39.490 --> 00:03:42.390 
very very nervous we're only weeks away
maybe<00:03:40.330> even<00:03:40.540> two<00:03:40.840> weeks<00:03:40.870> away<00:03:41.770> from<00:03:42.010> the

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:42.400 
maybe even two weeks away from the

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:44.100 
maybe even two weeks away from the
release<00:03:42.670> of<00:03:42.820> this<00:03:43.030> game<00:03:43.240> and<00:03:43.510> we<00:03:43.810> really

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:44.110 
release of this game and we really

00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:45.330 
release of this game and we really
haven't<00:03:44.380> seen<00:03:44.590> anything<00:03:44.860> about<00:03:45.190> it<00:03:45.310> now

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:45.340 
haven't seen anything about it now

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:49.230 
haven't seen anything about it now
usually<00:03:46.020> usually<00:03:47.220> that<00:03:48.220> is<00:03:48.430> the<00:03:48.580> formula<00:03:48.910> for

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:49.240 
usually usually that is the formula for

00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:52.080 
usually usually that is the formula for
a<00:03:49.570> bad<00:03:49.900> game<00:03:50.380> I'm<00:03:50.890> hoping<00:03:51.190> it's<00:03:51.340> not<00:03:51.550> but

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:52.090 
a bad game I'm hoping it's not but

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:54.360 
a bad game I'm hoping it's not but
usually<00:03:52.420> when<00:03:52.600> developers<00:03:53.380> make<00:03:53.590> a<00:03:53.620> game<00:03:53.950> and

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:54.370 
usually when developers make a game and

00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:56.520 
usually when developers make a game and
I<00:03:54.580> like<00:03:54.760> we're<00:03:55.060> not<00:03:55.270> really<00:03:55.660> gonna<00:03:55.870> show<00:03:56.260> up

00:03:56.520 --> 00:03:56.530 
I like we're not really gonna show up

00:03:56.530 --> 00:03:58.710 
I like we're not really gonna show up
very<00:03:56.920> much<00:03:57.070> of<00:03:57.370> this<00:03:57.460> game<00:03:57.670> at<00:03:57.820> all<00:03:57.940> we're<00:03:58.600> not

very much of this game at all we're not

00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:00.000 
very much of this game at all we're not
gonna<00:03:58.840> release<00:03:59.140> a<00:03:59.230> demo<00:03:59.470> or<00:03:59.590> anything<00:03:59.980> like

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:00.010 
gonna release a demo or anything like

00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:01.950 
gonna release a demo or anything like
that<00:04:00.100> it<00:04:00.400> usually<00:04:00.430> means<00:04:00.940> they're<00:04:01.240> counting

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:01.960 
that it usually means they're counting
