people<00:00:14.070> are<00:00:14.429> usually<00:00:14.639> upgrade<00:00:15.179> to<00:00:15.360> stainless

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:15.690 
people are usually upgrade to stainless

people are usually upgrade to stainless
steel<00:00:15.870> lines<00:00:16.109> is<00:00:16.350> because<00:00:16.710> they<00:00:17.369> like<00:00:17.640> their

00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:17.880 
steel lines is because they like their

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:20.390 
steel lines is because they like their
brake<00:00:18.449> pedal<00:00:18.779> to<00:00:18.900> feel<00:00:19.080> more<00:00:19.260> firm<00:00:19.650> more

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:20.400 
brake pedal to feel more firm more

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:23.060 
brake pedal to feel more firm more
direct<00:00:20.850> and<00:00:21.180> more<00:00:21.359> precise<00:00:21.840> when<00:00:22.680> they<00:00:22.800> apply

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:23.070 
direct and more precise when they apply

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:25.040 
direct and more precise when they apply
the<00:00:23.130> brakes<00:00:23.460> and<00:00:23.699> it<00:00:23.820> has<00:00:24.630> come

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:25.050 
the brakes and it has come

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:27.380 
the brakes and it has come
and<00:00:25.140> then<00:00:25.320> troubles<00:00:25.740> through<00:00:25.949> into<00:00:26.400> the<00:00:26.789> brick

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:27.390

CalPERS<00:00:27.779> I<00:00:28.050> show<00:00:28.590> this<00:00:28.680> techni<00:00:29.039> fit<00:00:29.279> I<00:00:29.550> love

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:30.150 
CalPERS I show this techni fit I love

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:32.780 
CalPERS I show this techni fit I love
techni<00:00:30.510> fit<00:00:30.720> so<00:00:31.080> it's<00:00:31.830> a<00:00:32.040> user<00:00:32.430> comes<00:00:32.640> in

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:32.790 
techni fit so it's a user comes in

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:34.880 
techni fit so it's a user comes in
silver<00:00:32.969> and<00:00:33.360> I<00:00:33.960> think<00:00:34.140> they<00:00:34.440> usually<00:00:34.559> making

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:34.890 
silver and I think they usually making

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:36.020 
silver and I think they usually making
that<00:00:34.980> out<00:00:35.070> of<00:00:35.160> flowers<00:00:35.460> too<00:00:35.579> if<00:00:35.640> you<00:00:35.760> request

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:36.030 
that out of flowers too if you request

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:38.330 
that out of flowers too if you request
it<00:00:36.270> but<00:00:36.630> some<00:00:37.469> of<00:00:37.590> those<00:00:37.649> tan<00:00:37.829> colors<00:00:38.160> for

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:38.340 
it but some of those tan colors for

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:41.060 
it but some of those tan colors for
techni<00:00:38.579> fits<00:00:38.820> and<00:00:39.570> here<00:00:40.050> the<00:00:40.260> forensic

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.070 
techni fits and here the forensic

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:43.280 
techni fits and here the forensic
findings<00:00:41.250> I<00:00:41.430> have<00:00:41.579> then<00:00:42.120> I<00:00:42.420> need<00:00:42.989> the<00:00:43.110> clutch

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.290 
findings I have then I need the clutch

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:46.010 
findings I have then I need the clutch
line<00:00:43.500> -<00:00:43.770> so<00:00:44.040> the<00:00:44.219> clutch<00:00:44.399> also<00:00:44.670> has<00:00:44.879> a<00:00:45.120> rubber

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020 
line - so the clutch also has a rubber

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:47.510 
line - so the clutch also has a rubber
hose<00:00:46.230> from<00:00:46.440> the<00:00:46.530> factory<00:00:46.980> that<00:00:47.010> cops<00:00:47.340> like

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520 
hose from the factory that cops like

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:51.650 
hose from the factory that cops like
spam<00:00:47.820> so<00:00:48.660> basically<00:00:48.899> the<00:00:49.110> clutch<00:00:49.739> and<00:00:50.660> brake

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:51.660 
spam so basically the clutch and brake

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:53.750 
spam so basically the clutch and brake
lines<00:00:51.899> they<00:00:52.170> usually<00:00:52.320> have<00:00:52.680> rubber<00:00:53.430> hoses

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760 
lines they usually have rubber hoses

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:55.040 
lines they usually have rubber hoses
where<00:00:53.879> it<00:00:54.000> can<00:00:54.120> expand<00:00:54.539> and<00:00:54.719> that's<00:00:54.809> where

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
where it can expand and that's where

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:57.830 
where it can expand and that's where
wasted<00:00:55.890> power<00:00:56.100> can<00:00:56.399> go<00:00:56.430> so<00:00:56.670> this<00:00:57.090> job<00:00:57.390> is<00:00:57.660> not

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840 
wasted power can go so this job is not

00:00:57.840 --> 00:00:58.430 
wasted power can go so this job is not
that<00:00:58.020> hard

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
that hard

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:00.110 
that hard
so<00:00:58.649> basically<00:00:58.920> the<00:00:59.219> first<00:00:59.399> you<00:00:59.579> gonna<00:00:59.730> do<00:00:59.910> is

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
so basically the first you gonna do is

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:02.420 
so basically the first you gonna do is
gonna<00:01:00.239> raise<00:01:00.539> the<00:01:00.750> car<00:01:00.989> maybe<00:01:01.859> the<00:01:02.010> section<00:01:02.340> -

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
gonna raise the car maybe the section -

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:04.820 
gonna raise the car maybe the section -
I<00:01:02.660> raise<00:01:03.660> this<00:01:03.930> section<00:01:04.290> of<00:01:04.379> the<00:01:04.439> car<00:01:04.619> that<00:01:04.739> you

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:50.060 
because
because<00:01:48.960> you<00:01:49.049> can<00:01:49.170> see<00:01:49.289> it<00:01:49.560> wraps<00:01:49.859> around

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:50.070 
because you can see it wraps around

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:52.370 
because you can see it wraps around
almost<00:01:50.520> complete<00:01:50.999> circle<00:01:51.420> but<00:01:52.079> as<00:01:52.170> a<00:01:52.229> little

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380 
almost complete circle but as a little

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:55.010 
almost complete circle but as a little
spike<00:01:52.649> opening<00:01:53.159> on<00:01:53.310> my<00:01:53.700> hands<00:01:54.030> I<00:01:54.119> can<00:01:54.270> go<00:01:54.840> into

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020 
spike opening on my hands I can go into

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:56.929 
spike opening on my hands I can go into
the<00:01:55.259> brake<00:01:55.469> line<00:01:55.679> and<00:01:56.399> then<00:01:56.520> and<00:01:56.819> then

00:01:56.929 --> 00:01:56.939 
the brake line and then and then

00:01:56.939 --> 00:01:58.429 
the brake line and then and then
remember<00:01:57.240> on<00:01:57.329> the<00:01:57.420> die<00:01:57.569> this<00:01:58.109> one's<00:01:58.319> more

00:01:58.429 --> 00:01:58.439 
remember on the die this one's more

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:00.230 
remember on the die this one's more
surface<00:01:58.770> area<00:01:58.890> than<00:01:59.069> just<00:01:59.909> a<00:01:59.939> little<00:02:00.030> wrench

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:00.240 
surface area than just a little wrench

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:03.529 
surface area than just a little wrench
so<00:02:01.200> it'll<00:02:01.740> be<00:02:02.009> much<00:02:02.310> less<00:02:02.700> likely<00:02:02.729> to<00:02:03.090> strip

00:02:03.529 --> 00:02:03.539 
so it'll be much less likely to strip

00:02:03.539 --> 00:02:06.050 
so it'll be much less likely to strip
the<00:02:03.689> nut<00:02:03.899> with<00:02:04.140> this<00:02:04.350> pine<00:02:04.649> wrench<00:02:04.950> instead<00:02:05.939> of

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:06.060 
the nut with this pine wrench instead of

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:08.029 
the nut with this pine wrench instead of
adjustable<00:02:06.479> wrench<00:02:06.750> so<00:02:07.679> it's<00:02:07.799> highly

00:02:08.029 --> 00:02:08.039 
adjustable wrench so it's highly

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:09.919 
adjustable wrench so it's highly
recommended<00:02:08.250> you<00:02:08.580> use<00:02:08.640> that<00:02:08.879> when<00:02:09.479> you<00:02:09.629> bleed
