00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:02.929
 good 

00:00:04.870 --> 00:00:12.490
 godzilla versus caigan or godzilla 

00:00:08.459 --> 00:00:14.620
 they showed in their release in the USA something 

00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:16.950
 that only about two minutes will be shown 

00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:18.870
 but we will decide 

00:00:16.950 --> 00:00:22.830
 the plot unfolds on a 

00:00:18.870 --> 00:00:25.410
 draftsman that is that in relation to 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:27.870
 godzilla and they are just their main would be 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:30.900
 a very normal giant statue of the world 

00:00:27.870 --> 00:00:32.730
 the king of the keys but those who 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:35.610
 they ordered to get this part of 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:37.380
 amusements are mutating cockroaches and the 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:40.160
 planet 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:40.160
 efe 

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:47.040
 they are already bad and the only thing 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:49.890
 they needed was this park like graves 

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:53.390
 in operations to unleash to fall and 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:53.390
 now here 

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:59.269
 we will see an epic confrontation of 

00:00:57.410 --> 00:01:02.329
 several that help here we are already less 

00:00:59.269 --> 00:01:07.640
 good to the world communicated 

00:01:02.329 --> 00:01:11.240
 but how 

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:14.060
 because it was good but now he's still alive 

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:16.640
 if we remember and watched the videos 

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:19.400
 previous we took off 62 the votes 

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:22.070
 they put a godmother and they killed him what 

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:23.810
 they left dusting the answer is that 

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:25.880
 destroy some verses would be in the future 

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:28.880
 the one that tells us that this movie is in 

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:30.200
 the present and good is chaos too 

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:32.090
 let's see that there are a lot of 

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:36.380
 repeated messages from your engines 

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:38.509
 again and the footage hit the famous 

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:40.670
 because it's godzilla footage 

00:01:38.509 --> 00:01:43.670
 contradict the sections to our 

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:46.220
 let's go and then what can we do is cause truth 

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:49.009
 it's something well given to girls but 

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:50.070
 good returning them the firm fall 

00:01:49.009 --> 00:01:52.800
 children 

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:55.470
 and golden ones are going to destroy the world and 

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:58.380
 that attracts the attention of garage and good 

00:01:55.470 --> 00:02:00.960
 ok if he is upset he asks for help for the 

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:02.580
 good eels here happens another of the 

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:04.890
 strangest things you can see in the 

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:07.670
 crisis films because in the usa 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:07.670
 they speak 

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:16.640
 jac 

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:24.670
 well they spoke in japan 

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:26.620
 They talked game dialogue as the 

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:29.140
 comics that was a little more decent 

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:30.760
 because as I already taught as if someone 

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:33.790
 was mixing the music would be 

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:34.959
 very loaded in English well now we're going 

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:38.800
 watching the movie in the showdown 

00:02:34.959 --> 00:02:41.890
 between shanghai ocs and the contract it 

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:45.220
 will liquidate is wow as you are seeing is 

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:46.750
 full of blood sweat glory chaos wow 

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:48.700
 here is the truth is that the 

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:51.160
 movie was no longer so oriented to the 

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:53.920
 children if they were more adults a little 

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:56.290
 are the lazy psychological adults who 

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:57.710
 it was another wave of truth we have everything 

00:02:56.290 --> 00:03:00.480
 in this film 

00:02:57.710 --> 00:03:04.890
 and we saw that it is already a step away from 

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:07.170
 the ravens since this shows us a 

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:11.230
 little more than is the war of the 

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:12.849
 cayos and its unleashes psychological environment 

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:15.010
 if you like movies if you 

00:03:12.849 --> 00:03:17.590
 it was costing this to throw a 

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:20.110
 Look, you know, I'll leave the links in 

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:23.500
 the description to see blood tears 

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:27.269
 sweat godzilla higuain immensity of 

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:27.269
 things we see in the movies
