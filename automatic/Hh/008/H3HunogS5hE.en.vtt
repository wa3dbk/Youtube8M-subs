00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.380
 Hi everyone, today I would like to 

00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:05.940
 tell you and show things one chair 

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:08.880
 which I take with me to the sea 

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:11.060
 I will say right away it will not be much because 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:13.700
 i don't like holding on 

00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:15.980
 releasing heavy bags changing body bags 

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:18.740
 in general, how much was more or less 

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:21.080
 easy decided shops and mother Valya 

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:23.180
 few units and i will need me here 

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:25.490
 so let's get started this first thing 

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:28.490
 which I take with me to the sea and I think 

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:31.250
 obviously this swimsuit was buying it in 

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:31.910
 Turkey did not like to wear it 

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:34.579
 grid 

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:37.370
 here is such where where is still a plate and 

00:00:34.579 --> 00:00:41.750
 that's such a down and it was probably worth 

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:44.660
 dollars 17 or 20 I do not remember the article 

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:46.910
 / Carefully to me that you do not want him 

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:49.700
 nonsense so I will take only one further 

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:50.210
 sundress in which I will walk just in 

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:53.000
 the room 

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:54.650
 he is from the bottom like shorts and he is on top 

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:57.080
 buttons on you them not 

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:59.420
 and seen as he straps 

00:00:57.080 --> 00:01:01.190
 this one is ripped off i think the class will fall to 

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:04.009
 walk in the world because i will not 

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:06.619
 hot he's thin enough i also take 

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:08.810
 Shorts course Black from the store Kohl 

00:01:06.619 --> 00:01:10.400
 No, they denim track, I think you can 

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:11.630
 will wear in the evenings with T-shirts or 

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:13.970
 in general not only in the evenings 

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:16.010
 but the explosions are cool 

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:18.500
 there surely will be hot I'm sure of it 

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:21.050
 but just in case, all the same I take with 

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:22.220
 a cardigan from my cardigan 

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:26.210
 house store 

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:28.760
 I bought it back in May is a cardigan 

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:31.040
 just gorgeous i think if there will be 

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:33.800
 cool it can be thrown and all 

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:36.110
 it will be good because neither is hot 

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:37.070
 nor cold it fastens just like that 

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:39.110
 and hanging out 

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:41.510
 goes further south and don't really remember 

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:44.630
 where I bought but very capacious to me 

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:47.210
 like she looks very lush and 

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:50.240
 because here lined sewn 

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:51.770
 lace and they make the beer more lush 

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:53.900
 I like it very much I think 

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:55.820
 you can dress in the evening and take a walk 

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:57.350
 with ballet flats here's this black cape 

00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:59.600
 which I just showed you 

00:01:57.350 --> 00:02:02.330
 head to and will be very cool image 

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:04.640
 this year, for some reason, I wear 

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:06.890
 Dresses before I not particularly loved but in 

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:09.530

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:11.900
 so I take with you a dress like this 

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:13.850
 Here and earlier on from the collins shop she 

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:15.980
 with a little strap on I take with 

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:18.380
 a two white t-shirt absolutely 

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:20.870
 the same price of this size I will buy 

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:22.340
 their collins store yesterday by the way they tell me 

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:25.340
 like because they are very practical 

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:27.260
 and they can be worn and school and just 

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:29.480

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:31.640

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:37.580
 Chonde with a short 

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:39.709
 there and the neckline is pretty good 

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:43.220

00:02:39.709 --> 00:02:45.260

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:47.160
