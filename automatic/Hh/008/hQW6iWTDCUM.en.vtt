00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:32.520 
talk about sort of deaf streaks I think

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:33.530 
talk about sort of deaf streaks I think
they<00:00:32.579> should<00:00:32.730> get<00:00:32.790> rid<00:00:32.940> of<00:00:33.000> deaf<00:00:33.239> streaks

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:33.540 
they should get rid of deaf streaks

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:36.229 
they should get rid of deaf streaks
mainly<00:00:33.809> because<00:00:34.100> people<00:00:35.100> so<00:00:35.670> the<00:00:35.820> newer

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:36.239 
mainly because people so the newer

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:38.090 
mainly because people so the newer
players<00:00:36.570> are<00:00:36.809> sort<00:00:36.960> of<00:00:37.020> relying<00:00:37.739> on<00:00:37.920> them

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:38.100 
players are sort of relying on them

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:40.850 
players are sort of relying on them
compared<00:00:38.850> to<00:00:38.940> like<00:00:39.510> obviously<00:00:39.750> in<00:00:40.500> the<00:00:40.649> slight

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860 
compared to like obviously in the slight

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:42.200 
compared to like obviously in the slight
slightly<00:00:41.309> like<00:00:41.460> people<00:00:41.820> have<00:00:41.879> been<00:00:42.000> playing

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210 
slightly like people have been playing

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:44.750 
slightly like people have been playing
it<00:00:42.329> for<00:00:42.480> a<00:00:42.960> long<00:00:43.110> time<00:00:43.140> so<00:00:43.920> for<00:00:44.070> instance<00:00:44.129> I

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
it for a long time so for instance I

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:46.100 
it for a long time so for instance I
think<00:00:44.940> juices<00:00:45.300> all<00:00:45.450> right<00:00:45.539> I<00:00:45.570> think<00:00:45.870> they

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.110 
think juices all right I think they

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:47.540 
think juices all right I think they
could<00:00:46.260> keep<00:00:46.379> like<00:00:46.590> certain<00:00:47.100> dev<00:00:47.250> streaks

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 
could keep like certain dev streaks

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:49.369 
could keep like certain dev streaks
things<00:00:48.270> like<00:00:48.450> Mardon<00:00:48.930> they've<00:00:49.079> had<00:00:49.200> that

00:00:49.369 --> 00:00:49.379 
things like Mardon they've had that

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:51.049 
things like Mardon they've had that
since<00:00:49.559> like<00:00:49.680> orgy<00:00:50.039> for<00:00:50.309> probably<00:00:50.640> before<00:00:50.789> that

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:51.059 
since like orgy for probably before that

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:53.479 
since like orgy for probably before that
have<00:00:51.149> actually<00:00:51.300> paid<00:00:51.600> and<00:00:51.780> evac<00:00:51.989> orgies<00:00:52.489> 400g

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:53.489 
have actually paid and evac orgies 400g

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:55.840 
have actually paid and evac orgies 400g
before<00:00:53.789> I<00:00:54.000> also<00:00:54.930> think<00:00:55.170> they<00:00:55.320> should

00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:55.850 
before I also think they should

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:57.799 
before I also think they should
obviously<00:00:56.850> get<00:00:57.210> rid<00:00:57.329> of<00:00:57.360> things<00:00:57.480> at<00:00:57.660> dead

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
obviously get rid of things at dead

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:00.229 
obviously get rid of things at dead

need<00:01:47.220> to<00:01:47.280> get<00:01:47.369> rid<00:01:47.520> of<00:01:47.549> things<00:01:47.759> like<00:01:47.970> the

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:48.180 
need to get rid of things like the

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:50.210 
need to get rid of things like the
stealth<00:01:48.450> bomber<00:01:48.570> and<00:01:48.990> precision<00:01:49.860> aetna

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:50.220 
stealth bomber and precision aetna

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:51.950 
stealth bomber and precision aetna
precision<00:01:50.670> Esther<00:01:50.909> I'm<00:01:51.060> not<00:01:51.180> sure<00:01:51.329> stealth

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:51.960 
precision Esther I'm not sure stealth

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:53.929 
precision Esther I'm not sure stealth
bomber<00:01:52.229> recon<00:01:53.100> Joanna<00:01:53.399> finish<00:01:53.610> to<00:01:53.700> get<00:01:53.790> rid<00:01:53.909> of

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:53.939 
bomber recon Joanna finish to get rid of

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:56.749 
bomber recon Joanna finish to get rid of
that<00:01:54.090> just<00:01:54.329> because<00:01:54.979> maybe<00:01:55.979> keep<00:01:56.310> the<00:01:56.399> recon

00:01:56.749 --> 00:01:56.759 
that just because maybe keep the recon

00:01:56.759 --> 00:01:58.429 
that just because maybe keep the recon
drone<00:01:56.969> but<00:01:57.149> not<00:01:57.299> have<00:01:57.420> it<00:01:57.540> flashing<00:01:58.079> because<00:01:58.320> I

00:01:58.429 --> 00:01:58.439 
drone but not have it flashing because I

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:00.319 
drone but not have it flashing because I
know<00:01:58.500> that<00:01:58.740> has<00:01:58.950> really<00:01:59.189> annoyed<00:01:59.399> me<00:01:59.430> or<00:02:00.000> so

00:02:00.319 --> 00:02:00.329 
know that has really annoyed me or so

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:01.760 
know that has really annoyed me or so
think<00:02:00.540> they<00:02:00.630> should<00:02:00.780> get<00:02:00.869> rid<00:02:01.020> of<00:02:01.079> that<00:02:01.170> if

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:01.770 
think they should get rid of that if

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:04.160 
think they should get rid of that if
they<00:02:01.890> bring<00:02:02.579> your<00:02:02.700> back<00:02:02.790> support<00:02:03.210> and<00:02:03.420> sort<00:02:04.140> of

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:04.170 
they bring your back support and sort of

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:05.149 
they bring your back support and sort of
carrying<00:02:04.560> on<00:02:04.619> from<00:02:04.680> all<00:02:04.860> for<00:02:05.009> free

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:05.159 
carrying on from all for free

carrying on from all for free

killstreaks get rid of the i think is

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:10.219

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:12.450 
any need for that it's sort of like a

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:13.820 
any need for that it's sort of like a
bit<00:02:12.870> of<00:02:12.900> an<00:02:13.020> overpowered

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830 
bit of an overpowered

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:15.320 
bit of an overpowered
kill<00:02:14.070> shook<00:02:14.280> a<00:02:14.340> bit<00:02:14.490> like<00:02:14.610> their<00:02:14.760> stealth<00:02:15.120> R

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:15.330

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:17.300 
kill shook a bit like their stealth R
which<00:02:15.840> is<00:02:15.990> like<00:02:16.110> really<00:02:16.440> really<00:02:16.770> overpowered

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:17.310 
which is like really really overpowered

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:19.130 
which is like really really overpowered
at<00:02:17.490> ends<00:02:17.700> don't<00:02:18.090> quite<00:02:18.420> know<00:02:18.450> why<00:02:18.720> that's<00:02:18.930> in

at ends don't quite know why that's in
asked<00:02:19.530> support<00:02:20.310> guess<00:02:21.000> it's<00:02:21.180> it<00:02:21.480> gets<00:02:21.540> quite

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:21.960 
asked support guess it's it gets quite

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:23.480 
asked support guess it's it gets quite
good<00:02:22.080> for<00:02:22.170> objective<00:02:22.590> playing<00:02:22.830> but<00:02:23.400> I've

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:23.490 
good for objective playing but I've

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:25.640 
good for objective playing but I've
never<00:02:23.610> really<00:02:23.880> used<00:02:24.090> support<00:02:24.510> salary<00:02:25.140> no<00:02:25.350> it's

never really used support salary no it's

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:27.590 
never really used support salary no it's
probably<00:02:25.890> good<00:02:26.040> just<00:02:26.970> pull<00:02:27.120> because<00:02:27.300> you<00:02:27.480> can

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:27.600 
probably good just pull because you can

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:29.060 
probably good just pull because you can
clear<00:02:27.780> a<00:02:27.810> certain<00:02:28.140> part<00:02:28.320> of<00:02:28.350> the<00:02:28.410> month<00:02:28.620> but<00:02:28.980> it

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:29.070 
clear a certain part of the month but it

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:31.670 
clear a certain part of the month but it
also<00:02:29.220> pisses<00:02:29.550> people<00:02:29.790> off<00:02:30.030> like<00:02:30.680> ridiculous

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:31.680 
also pisses people off like ridiculous

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:36.170 
also pisses people off like ridiculous
amounts<00:02:32.100> yes<00:02:33.090> so<00:02:33.530> guns<00:02:34.790> quite<00:02:35.790> like<00:02:35.970> white

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:36.180 
amounts yes so guns quite like white

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:37.310 
amounts yes so guns quite like white
like<00:02:36.300> some<00:02:36.450> of<00:02:36.540> the<00:02:36.600> gun<00:02:36.780> silver<00:02:37.110> a<00:02:37.140> bit

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:37.320 
like some of the gun silver a bit

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:39.800 
like some of the gun silver a bit
overpowered<00:02:37.890> like<00:02:38.070> the<00:02:38.280> ACR<00:02:39.000> some<00:02:39.480> guns<00:02:39.690> are

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:39.810 
overpowered like the ACR some guns are

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:41.300 
overpowered like the ACR some guns are
obviously<00:02:40.080> more<00:02:40.230> use<00:02:40.500> more<00:02:40.770> than<00:02:40.950> others<00:02:41.040> I

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:41.310 
obviously more use more than others I

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:44.300 
obviously more use more than others I
think<00:02:42.060> the<00:02:42.270> PM<00:02:42.720> 9<00:02:43.020> is<00:02:43.350> really<00:02:43.620> powerful<00:02:43.860> but

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:44.310 
think the PM 9 is really powerful but

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:45.980 
think the PM 9 is really powerful but
obviously<00:02:44.940> less<00:02:45.090> people<00:02:45.300> use<00:02:45.510> it<00:02:45.690> because<00:02:45.810> of

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:45.990 
obviously less people use it because of

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:47.180 
obviously less people use it because of
the<00:02:46.050> amount<00:02:46.170> of<00:02:46.260> recoil<00:02:46.470> but<00:02:46.890> obviously<00:02:47.100> you

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:47.190 
the amount of recoil but obviously you

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:50.720 
the amount of recoil but obviously you
need<00:02:47.340> to<00:02:47.460> hit<00:02:47.700> fire<00:02:47.970> a<00:02:48.000> bit<00:02:48.240> more<00:02:49.190> fa<00:02:50.190> dr<00:02:50.580> quite

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:50.730 
need to hit fire a bit more fa dr quite

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:51.920 
need to hit fire a bit more fa dr quite

don't quite know why it's got like let
you<00:03:41.220> know<00:03:41.480> recoil<00:03:42.480> because<00:03:42.989> obviously<00:03:43.230> now<00:03:43.530> it

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:43.650 
you know recoil because obviously now it

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:45.740 
you know recoil because obviously now it
just<00:03:43.680> attracts<00:03:44.310> people<00:03:44.760> to<00:03:44.790> use<00:03:45.060> and<00:03:45.300> I

00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:45.750 
just attracts people to use and I

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:49.130 
just attracts people to use and I
actually<00:03:46.530> find<00:03:46.800> it<00:03:46.980> can<00:03:47.220> be<00:03:47.400> more<00:03:47.780> useful<00:03:48.780> at

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:49.140 
actually find it can be more useful at

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:50.990 
actually find it can be more useful at
Cross<00:03:49.320> maps<00:03:49.590> than<00:03:50.190> sort<00:03:50.519> of<00:03:50.580> our<00:03:50.670> assault

00:03:50.990 --> 00:03:51.000

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:52.550 
Cross maps than sort of our assault
rifles<00:03:51.390> which<00:03:51.540> sounds<00:03:51.870> like<00:03:51.989> really<00:03:52.470> really

00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:52.560 
rifles which sounds like really really

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:55.160 
rifles which sounds like really really
stupid<00:03:52.920> but<00:03:53.760> it<00:03:54.060> actually<00:03:54.239> actually<00:03:54.810> is<00:03:54.930> it's

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:55.170 
stupid but it actually actually is it's

00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:57.110 
stupid but it actually actually is it's
like<00:03:55.320> literally<00:03:55.709> no<00:03:55.860> recoil<00:03:56.220> at<00:03:56.370> all<00:03:56.550> if<00:03:57.030> you

00:03:57.110 --> 00:03:57.120 
like literally no recoil at all if you

00:03:57.120 --> 00:03:59.509 
like literally no recoil at all if you
put<00:03:57.269> a<00:03:57.300> silencer<00:03:57.570> on<00:03:57.840> it<00:03:57.989> kick<00:03:58.290> that<00:03:58.620> you<00:03:58.980> can't

00:03:59.509 --> 00:03:59.519 
put a silencer on it kick that you can't

00:03:59.519 --> 00:04:00.680 
put a silencer on it kick that you can't
tell<00:03:59.700> the<00:03:59.760> difference<00:03:59.940> between<00:04:00.090> that<00:04:00.450> an<00:04:00.570> air

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:00.690 
tell the difference between that an air

tell the difference between that an air
assault<00:04:01.440> rifle<00:04:01.980> obviously<00:04:02.250> the<00:04:02.400> bullets<00:04:02.910> do

00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:03.030

so<00:04:03.180> drop<00:04:03.420> off<00:04:03.540> a<00:04:03.600> bit<00:04:03.959> a<00:04:04.620> bit<00:04:04.830> further<00:04:05.610> or

00:04:05.990 --> 00:04:06.000 
so drop off a bit a bit further or

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:07.880 
so drop off a bit a bit further or
earlier<00:04:06.600> then<00:04:06.840> assault<00:04:07.230> rifles<00:04:07.620> but

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:07.890 
earlier then assault rifles but

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:11.320 
earlier then assault rifles but
obviously<00:04:08.610> for<00:04:08.760> close<00:04:08.970> range<00:04:09.120> it's<00:04:09.840> mad<00:04:10.680> I

00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:11.330 
obviously for close range it's mad I

00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:13.490 
obviously for close range it's mad I
really<00:04:12.330> like<00:04:12.450> the<00:04:12.600> pp<00:04:12.840> night<00:04:12.989> either<00:04:13.140> pinay

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:33.750 
think I'm the ak-47 obviously obviously

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:37.550 
think I'm the ak-47 obviously obviously
in<00:04:34.050> my<00:04:34.080> life<00:04:34.490> three<00:04:35.490> the<00:04:36.060> ak-47<00:04:36.930> wasn't<00:04:37.200> quite

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:37.560 
in my life three the ak-47 wasn't quite

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:41.930 
in my life three the ak-47 wasn't quite
as<00:04:37.740> used<00:04:38.040> as<00:04:38.310> much<00:04:38.900> as<00:04:39.950> it<00:04:40.950> was<00:04:41.070> in<00:04:41.310> black<00:04:41.790> ops

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:41.940 
as used as much as it was in black ops

00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:43.280 
as used as much as it was in black ops
many<00:04:42.180> because<00:04:42.360> it's<00:04:42.540> quite<00:04:42.660> a<00:04:42.690> high<00:04:42.810> level<00:04:43.110> and

00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:43.290 
many because it's quite a high level and

00:04:43.290 --> 00:04:46.400 
many because it's quite a high level and
I<00:04:43.530> don't<00:04:43.950> really<00:04:44.160> think<00:04:44.640> many<00:04:44.880> people<00:04:45.410> are

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:46.410 
I don't really think many people are

00:04:46.410 --> 00:04:49.520 
I don't really think many people are
sort<00:04:46.560> of<00:04:46.650> needed<00:04:46.950> need<00:04:47.640> to<00:04:47.790> use<00:04:47.970> it<00:04:48.210> and<00:04:48.810> then

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:49.530 
sort of needed need to use it and then

00:04:49.530 --> 00:04:52.430 
sort of needed need to use it and then
also<00:04:49.860> to<00:04:50.010> talk<00:04:50.610> sort<00:04:51.210> of<00:04:51.270> like<00:04:51.330> going<00:04:51.900> on<00:04:52.110> to

00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:52.440 
also to talk sort of like going on to

00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:54.620 
also to talk sort of like going on to
knife<00:04:53.310> in<00:04:53.550> I<00:04:53.670> think<00:04:53.880> the<00:04:53.940> knife<00:04:54.090> already<00:04:54.390> to<00:04:54.570> be

00:04:54.620 --> 00:04:54.630 
knife in I think the knife already to be

00:04:54.630 --> 00:04:56.360 
knife in I think the knife already to be
fixed<00:04:55.050> just<00:04:55.230> purely<00:04:55.830> because<00:04:55.980> it's<00:04:56.250> like

00:04:56.360 --> 00:04:56.370 
fixed just purely because it's like

00:04:56.370 --> 00:04:58.190 
fixed just purely because it's like
obviously<00:04:56.520> yeah<00:04:57.180> like<00:04:57.330> commando<00:04:57.900> I<00:04:57.930> think

00:04:58.190 --> 00:04:58.200 
obviously yeah like commando I think

00:04:58.200 --> 00:05:01.130 
obviously yeah like commando I think
wasn't<00:04:58.470> it<00:04:58.620> in<00:04:58.800> a<00:04:59.000> more<00:05:00.000> fair<00:05:00.240> to<00:05:00.450> waken<00:05:00.870> I

00:05:01.130 --> 00:05:01.140 
wasn't it in a more fair to waken I

00:05:01.140 --> 00:05:03.350 
wasn't it in a more fair to waken I
