00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:25.289
 eo click on create this is the window 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:29.160
 for the creation of the groups I insert the 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:32.130
 name of the group I want to create I want 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:36.320
 create the group for my class iii g 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:39.950
 l for English for the school year 

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:44.879
 2013 2014 

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:48.570
 I don't choose a single level because then 

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:50.969
 I will find this entry in my profile 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:53.789
 I want you to see in my profile 

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:57.570
 who teaches in high school 

00:00:53.789 --> 00:01:02.010
 according to the American system by the ninth 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:06.330
 twelfth class class for 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:10.590
 find English I have to choose arts 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:13.320
 of language and then English these voices 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:15.450
 they must be chosen otherwise the system will not 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:17.880
 lets go ahead 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:20.930
 this is the first step of two I go 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:20.930
 at the next step 

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:27.689
 how big the group will be 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:31.159
 say I'm not sure yet but I know 

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:35.450
 that in this case the class consists of 

00:01:31.159 --> 00:01:42.509
 22 23 students so I look for this item 

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:46.439
 this entry is not necessary ends on 

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:50.070
 my group was created this is the 

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:54.479
 code that I will use tomorrow that I 

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:57.810
 I will communicate to my students tomorrow how 

00:01:54.479 --> 00:02:00.710
 do you eliminate a group 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:05.610
 let's see a group for example 

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:08.580
 that I've already used this for 

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:11.690
 example if I want to delete the group 

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:11.690
 this is the name of the group 

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:17.090
 I just need to click on the wheel 

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:19.790
 this icon which is a wheel e 

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:23.540
 symbolizes the settings one opens 

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:28.150
 group settings window 

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:32.540
 I click on the group and can decide to 

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:35.300
 change or delete if I go here 

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:38.780
 group will be eliminated 

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:41.720
 but this I will not do for today there are 

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:44.480
 other groups that I joined 

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:47.150
 for example this group here on 

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:50.090
 mind maps is an inactive group 

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:53.060
 that I don't really care 

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:56.599
 it is not a group that I created but from 

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:58.959
 this group I can withdraw by acting 

00:02:56.599 --> 00:03:03.140
 on this settings wheel 

00:02:58.959 --> 00:03:06.140
 I find the voice retreat 

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:09.950
 the click or you're sure you want 

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:11.750
 I'm sure to withdraw from this group 

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:14.450
 and I click on yes 

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:17.900
 here the group disappeared from the list of 

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:20.109
 my shots for today is over at 

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:20.109
 next
