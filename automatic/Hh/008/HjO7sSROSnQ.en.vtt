again well don't worry there's a reason

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:16.060 
again well don't worry there's a reason
for<00:00:14.219> that<00:00:14.429> and<00:00:14.730> in<00:00:15.150> this<00:00:15.299> video<00:00:15.540> I'll<00:00:15.960> explain

why<00:00:17.070> it<00:00:17.130> happens<00:00:17.580> on<00:00:17.730> how<00:00:18.240> to<00:00:18.300> come<00:00:18.690> back<00:00:18.900> to<00:00:19.109> it

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:20.510 
why it happens on how to come back to it

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:23.870 
why it happens on how to come back to it
stress<00:00:21.510> is<00:00:21.810> not<00:00:22.140> just<00:00:22.410> a<00:00:22.529> mental<00:00:22.859> reaction<00:00:23.550> but

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:23.880 
stress is not just a mental reaction but

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:28.250 
stress is not just a mental reaction but
a<00:00:24.029> physical<00:00:24.660> condition<00:00:26.689> web<00:00:27.689> placed<00:00:27.960> on<00:00:28.140> the

a physical condition web placed on the
stress<00:00:28.619> your<00:00:29.189> body<00:00:29.220> will<00:00:29.670> produce<00:00:29.720> adrenaline

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:30.720 
stress your body will produce adrenaline

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:33.020 
stress your body will produce adrenaline
but<00:00:31.170> it<00:00:31.260> also<00:00:31.500> produces<00:00:32.160> a<00:00:32.309> hormone<00:00:32.340> called

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:33.030 
but it also produces a hormone called

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:37.910 
but it also produces a hormone called
cortisol<00:00:34.430> this<00:00:35.430> hormone<00:00:36.000> is<00:00:36.680> responsible<00:00:37.680> for

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:37.920 
cortisol this hormone is responsible for

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:40.580 
cortisol this hormone is responsible for
pumping<00:00:38.100> energy<00:00:38.430> in<00:00:38.760> the<00:00:38.850> form<00:00:38.879> of<00:00:39.210> sugar<00:00:39.590> into

the body to fuel the adrenaline work
stress<00:00:44.129> is<00:00:44.430> then<00:00:44.789> a<00:00:44.969> natural<00:00:45.510> bodily<00:00:45.780> function

00:00:46.119 --> 00:00:46.129 
stress is then a natural bodily function

00:00:46.129 --> 00:00:48.650 
stress is then a natural bodily function
