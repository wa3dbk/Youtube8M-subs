00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:22.839
 slow in English crouch pot or slow that 

00:00:20.199 --> 00:00:25.539
 this type of pot allows them to cook 

00:00:22.839 --> 00:00:27.669
 nutritious and livestock foods that 

00:00:25.539 --> 00:00:30.339
 will be ready to be served as soon as 

00:00:27.669 --> 00:00:32.169
 come back home like that is many people 

00:00:30.339 --> 00:00:34.540
 They have electric cooker for slow cooking 

00:00:32.169 --> 00:00:36.370
 but they do not take advantage of it if you are one of 

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:39.160
 you will see that after seeing this 

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:41.470
 video that resolve to use it allow us 

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:43.240
 speak for a moment to those 

00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:45.270
 people in the audience who do not have 

00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:48.370
 a slow cooker 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:51.190
 these tips will help you to know 

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:53.170
 what kind of pot the pots should buy 

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:55.420
 electric for slow cooking come in 

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:56.860
 different shapes and sizes some are 

00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:59.740
 simpler and more complex 

00:00:56.860 --> 00:01:01.750
 let's start talking about the size to 

00:00:59.740 --> 00:01:03.520
 a family of four or more people 

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:06.189
 would fit one of six quarts 

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:06.670
 a family of two could use a 

00:01:06.189 --> 00:01:08.950
 cooking pot 

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:10.750
 the quarts does not suit you 

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:12.970
 pot too big because for that 

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:15.369
 the food cook well the pot 

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:17.799
 must be full at least the 

00:01:15.369 --> 00:01:20.350
 half you will also have to choose between 

00:01:17.799 --> 00:01:22.299
 a round pot or an oval in the 

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:23.979
 rounds are well cooked soups and 

00:01:22.299 --> 00:01:26.289
 stews but if you can choose 

00:01:23.979 --> 00:01:28.330
 I would recommend an oval because in it 

00:01:26.289 --> 00:01:31.210
 it also fits a complete chicken or a 

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:33.310
 cut of rest when you have identified 

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:35.799
 several pots of the size and shape that 

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:38.080
 you prefer the next step is to look 

00:01:35.799 --> 00:01:40.330
 good in its characteristics a good 

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:42.909
 pot must have a lid that sinha well 

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:45.369
 of transparent glass so you can 

00:01:42.909 --> 00:01:47.380
 see the foods and these can be 

00:01:45.369 --> 00:01:49.569
 cook without lifting the lid and leave 

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:51.580
 escape the heat because this delays the 

00:01:49.569 --> 00:01:53.759
 cooking process is also good 

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:56.470
 have a pot with a removable base 

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:58.270
 if the pot is of this type you can carry 

00:01:56.470 --> 00:02:00.459
 the food as a serving source 

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:02.590
 directly to the table, notice that you have 

00:02:00.459 --> 00:02:04.270
 strong and large handles where the 

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:06.580
 you can grab to take the food 

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:08.560
 directly to the kitchen to the table with 

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:10.360
 comfort and safety 

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:12.700
 this light comes on when the pot 

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:14.890
 electrical is in operation this 

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:17.190
 there is no risk of leaving it on 

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:19.720
 unintentionally if you have an automatic watch 

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:22.270
 this can be programmed so that the pot 

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:24.450
 at a specific time lower the 

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:26.590
 firing temperature to a lower level 

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:29.080
 just to keep the food 

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:31.180
 hot if instead of an automatic 

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:32.380
 you choose a mechanical pot you will have 

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:34.959
 adjust the cooking temperature 

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:36.700
 manually there are many types of pots 

00:02:34.959 --> 00:02:39.489
 with automatic watches that can 

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:41.110
 cost from 20 to 200 dollars take your 

00:02:39.489 --> 00:02:43.180
 time to read the box and the 

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:45.250
 characteristics of the product so that 

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:47.709
 know for sure that each one offers you 

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:50.560
 now let's see how the 

00:02:47.709 --> 00:02:52.390
 slow cooker electric cooker no 

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:55.090
 it only helps you cook in your 

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:57.310
 absence ' also saves you money not 

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:59.799
 you need to buy expensive meat and 

00:02:57.310 --> 00:03:02.230
 exquisite you can buy more cuts 

00:02:59.799 --> 00:03:04.150
 cheap and without fat because cooking 

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:06.670
 slow of the pot makes the meats 

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:08.680
 are more tender and there is no risk of 

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:11.080
 that the food is spoiled in a 

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:12.910
 Electric cooker for slow cooking is 

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:13.990
 totally safe because the pot 

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:16.330
 encloses the steam 

00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:18.430
 between the food and its lid followed and the 

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:20.590
 foods are cooked in the direct heat of 

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:22.660
 the pot for a long time in the 

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:25.630
 pot should be cooked with 

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:29.020
 quite liquid as in stewed soups 

00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:31.390
 chili tomato sauce and cuts of meat 

00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:33.910
 in broth and before you start should 

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:36.340
 make sure that everything is clean 

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:38.350
 the utensils your hands the area of 

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:39.750
 food preparation to avoid 

00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:42.250
 any risk of contamination 

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:43.990
 make sure to wash your hands before 

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:46.450
 take food and during the 

00:03:43.990 --> 00:03:48.250
 preparation according to food 

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:50.410
 that you are manipulating 

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:54.670
 what we will do today to see let's make a chili 

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:56.770
 with chicken how rich is an easy recipe and 

00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:58.660
 tasty that carries ingredients that 

00:03:56.770 --> 00:04:00.730
 you can buy with the assistance that you 

00:03:58.660 --> 00:04:02.440
 offer the week program I cut 

00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:04.570
 previously the vegetables and the chicken and 

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:05.740
 the rope in the refrigerator now the 

00:04:04.570 --> 00:04:07.660
 I bring 

00:04:05.740 --> 00:04:09.790
 always keep refrigerated 

00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:12.730
 perishable foods until you're 

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:15.430
 ready to use them if you are going to use meats 

00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:18.220
 or frozen chickens thaw those in 

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:21.160
 the refrigerator before using them another 

00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:23.740
 caution syllables fabrics and short 

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:25.900
 food the night before saves the 

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:28.540
 meats and vegetables separately in the 

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:30.970
 refrigerator always keep these two 

00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:34.060
 food groups separately for 

00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:36.800
 prevent these bacteria While we will 

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:39.940
 start with raw vegetables 

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:39.940
 the sweet peppers 

00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:44.700
 the onions 

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:48.229
 the carrots 

00:04:49.409 --> 00:04:53.309
 always for the raw vegetables first 

00:04:51.659 --> 00:04:55.830
 because it takes longer to cook than the 

00:04:53.309 --> 00:04:58.849
 meat now we must add the 

00:04:55.830 --> 00:04:58.849
 chicken bits 

00:05:04.590 --> 00:05:09.750
 we should wash the beans before 

00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:12.680
 use them with cold water now we add 

00:05:09.750 --> 00:05:12.680
 the white beans 

00:05:16.510 --> 00:05:19.770
 the black beans 

00:05:21.889 --> 00:05:25.569
 and the red beans 

00:05:28.249 --> 00:05:32.919
 they are followed by the tomatoes they are going to offer 

00:05:30.349 --> 00:05:32.919
 liquid 

00:05:35.480 --> 00:05:40.660
 and finally I sprinkle chili 

00:05:38.210 --> 00:05:40.660
 powder 

00:05:42.449 --> 00:05:47.729
 I mix it a bit and since the vegetables 

00:05:45.150 --> 00:05:49.799
 are cooked I will mix everything 

00:05:47.729 --> 00:05:53.559
 more intensely 

00:05:49.799 --> 00:05:55.449
 fantastic now we put the lid 

00:05:53.559 --> 00:05:57.999
 we will only raise to mix the 

00:05:55.449 --> 00:05:59.649
 chili or see if it's cooked maybe it 

00:05:57.999 --> 00:06:02.079
 are asking what temperature is 

00:05:59.649 --> 00:06:03.339
 puts the pot well most of the 

00:06:02.079 --> 00:06:05.709
 pots have two levels 

00:06:03.339 --> 00:06:07.689
 the recipes indicate and should be cooked 

00:06:05.709 --> 00:06:10.029
 high temperature or low temperature 

00:06:07.689 --> 00:06:12.339
 but if you 're not sure in general, 

00:06:10.029 --> 00:06:14.289
 they cook at low temperature if you have a 

00:06:12.339 --> 00:06:15.969
 little time before you leave you can 

00:06:14.289 --> 00:06:18.369
 put the ingredients to cook 

00:06:15.969 --> 00:06:20.739
 high temperature and then let it continue 

00:06:18.369 --> 00:06:23.409
 the cooking at low temperature but you do not 

00:06:20.739 --> 00:06:24.699
 worry the food will cook well if 

00:06:23.409 --> 00:06:26.979
 the kitchens from the beginning to 

00:06:24.699 --> 00:06:28.979
 low temperature that same thing I will do 

00:06:26.979 --> 00:06:32.110
 I now if the electricity is cut 

00:06:28.979 --> 00:06:34.389
 throw away the food when you're not at home 

00:06:32.110 --> 00:06:36.009
 to take no risks if it turns out that 

00:06:34.389 --> 00:06:38.860
 you were at home when you cut the 

00:06:36.009 --> 00:06:41.050
 electricity then passes the food to 

00:06:38.860 --> 00:06:43.300
 a common saucepan and ends 

00:06:41.050 --> 00:06:45.699
 cooking it on the stove fire or in 

00:06:43.300 --> 00:06:48.099
 a grill or maybe in another house 

00:06:45.699 --> 00:06:50.069
 person if the meal was over 

00:06:48.099 --> 00:06:51.909
 of cooking when the light was cut 

00:06:50.069 --> 00:06:54.399
 then you can save in the 

00:06:51.909 --> 00:06:55.700
 refrigerator or you can eat it while 

00:06:54.399 --> 00:06:58.340
 be hot 

00:06:55.700 --> 00:07:00.920
 you can keep the food in the pot 

00:06:58.340 --> 00:07:03.760
 electric from plugged in up to 2 

00:07:00.920 --> 00:07:06.800
 hours but no more other important data 

00:07:03.760 --> 00:07:09.080
 you can not reheat food in the pot 

00:07:06.800 --> 00:07:10.880
 electric for slow cooking would take 

00:07:09.080 --> 00:07:13.610
 too much time to heat food 

00:07:10.880 --> 00:07:15.830
 refrigerated in the pot therefore it is 

00:07:13.610 --> 00:07:16.850
 better do it in a pan in the oven or 

00:07:15.830 --> 00:07:19.310
 in the microwave 

00:07:16.850 --> 00:07:20.210
 if you want to use the pot to keep the 

00:07:19.310 --> 00:07:23.180
 hot meal 

00:07:20.210 --> 00:07:25.040
 you should light the pot to heat the 

00:07:23.180 --> 00:07:27.310
 food aside and since they are both 

00:07:25.040 --> 00:07:29.750
 hot to pass the food to the pot 

00:07:27.310 --> 00:07:32.690
 well let's let it be finished 

00:07:29.750 --> 00:07:35.210
 chili cook when you are ready not 

00:07:32.690 --> 00:07:37.250
 It is more than serving it if you want you can 

00:07:35.210 --> 00:07:40.070
 accompany it with brown rice and 

00:07:37.250 --> 00:07:42.620
 salad you can find this and other 

00:07:40.070 --> 00:07:46.390
 recipes in the link more information
