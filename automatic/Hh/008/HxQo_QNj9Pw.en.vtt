00:00:03.890 --> 00:00:09.769
 well here we go that little place 

00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:12.020
 take away and that is possible with a punch biopsy 

00:00:09.769 --> 00:00:13.910
 then just so we call it a look 

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:19.820
 we have different water levels 

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:21.710
 are from 2 mm 4 mm 6 mm 8 mm 8 mm 

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:23.509
 over the rain 6mm seems to me too 

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:25.099
 exaggerated their this 

00:00:23.509 --> 00:00:27.079
 actually appeals to me to have 

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:30.589
 he can do that at once 

00:00:27.079 --> 00:00:32.750
 be on and then it is immediately gone 

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:34.340
 or you with that 

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:36.949
 and what you're left with is no longer 

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:37.699
 attach how no more need be attached 

00:00:36.949 --> 00:00:40.160
 to become 

00:00:37.699 --> 00:00:43.399
 that is the question but we see that 

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:48.440
 then so good we will agree 

00:00:43.399 --> 00:00:54.500
 you get stunned for a moment 

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:57.620
 the injection comes now I spray something there 

00:00:54.500 --> 00:01:00.190
 soul okay with 

00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:00.190
 is going to win 

00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:07.960
 expect that you would be sufficiently stunned 

00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:09.630
 to be 

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:12.960
 [Music] 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:14.010
 we had chosen these now we get 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:16.910
 then 

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:16.910
 of pathology 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:21.860
 put in all these different sizes 

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:30.600
 and see if that was indeed appropriate 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:32.729
 just exactly and then we go the skin 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:34.920
 pull it apart 

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:37.710
 if we like that then you put the round together 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:42.660
 treasure of a turning the biopsy 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:46.200
 down and then razor-sharp 

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:49.950
 so here that out here that way 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:51.690
 is already there and one wants to do the 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:52.740
 pathologist anatomist and go i knew you 

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:55.560
 not with that 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:57.750
 tweezers we pick what you do that you pay attention to 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:02:01.800
 that's what we call those cells 

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:03.899
 sitting with difficulty with a needle 

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:05.819
 turns out it is also loose in these cases 

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:08.130
 My revenge is what you do 

00:02:05.819 --> 00:02:10.800
 then you have to pull it out 

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:12.990
 cutting in that case is not in this case 

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:14.550
 needed but the light goes in one 

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:16.140
 little pot 

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:18.450
 and now have a round hole here 

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:20.819
 but with my feeling a little too big 

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:21.930
 is not so falling apart that you 

00:02:20.819 --> 00:02:23.430
 nothing to do about it anymore 

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:26.270
 the fact would nevertheless a forklift you 

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:26.270
 must go through 

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:54.620
 red bit this one 

00:02:52.139 --> 00:02:54.620
 in a jar 

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:07.630
 nice but paper is being received 

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:11.170
 been for me 

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:14.670
 diameter of the mm is that someone has one 

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:14.670
 or tap into a syria 

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:26.720
 termes point is the tissue fragment 

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:28.760
 covered with a normal broad 

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:30.349
 come up regularly called baby the hermes 

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:33.290
 without trance or paris every time 

00:03:30.349 --> 00:03:35.959
 keratosis point the lazy is in its normal 

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:38.050
 and the nest and even cell exist 

00:03:35.959 --> 00:03:40.519
 a good issue in the trough 

00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:42.500
 no ascension by going on a road 

00:03:40.519 --> 00:03:44.290
 blush come a phormicola bridge 

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:45.680
 vibroplasty conspiracy plot 

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:47.450
 dilatation 

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:51.790
 or environment times of quote igniters 

00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:51.790
 I don't want my deep mitosis bridge
