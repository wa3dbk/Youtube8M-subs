the ambit 2 has all similar features and
weather<00:01:25.860> functions<00:01:26.369> and<00:01:26.880> like<00:01:27.240> the<00:01:27.360> 2s<00:01:27.810> it<00:01:28.110> has

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:28.409 
weather functions and like the 2s it has

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:30.980

multi-sport functions the ambit 2

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:33.530 
multi-sport functions the ambit 2
however<00:01:31.409> has<00:01:31.950> the<00:01:31.979> unique<00:01:32.400> fuse<00:01:32.850> LT<00:01:33.270> feature
