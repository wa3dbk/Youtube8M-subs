00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:23.189 
one will continue to part for our pipe

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:26.420 
one will continue to part for our pipe
bomb<00:01:23.400> so<00:01:23.610> there's<00:01:23.790> one<00:01:24.049> TNT<00:01:25.049> the<00:01:26.040> next<00:01:26.280> one

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:26.430 
bomb so there's one TNT the next one

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:29.240 
bomb so there's one TNT the next one
over<00:01:26.580> here<00:01:26.939> excuse<00:01:27.750> me<00:01:27.900> and<00:01:28.350> this<00:01:28.710> is<00:01:28.829> the<00:01:28.950> fuse
