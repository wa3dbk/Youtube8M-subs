00:00:00.869 --> 00:00:04.640
 for all of them woody and holstein a very simple tutorial 

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:07.680
 peralta dell inc as 

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:09.369
 to download 

00:00:09.369 --> 00:00:11.599
 of the death of game 

00:00:11.599 --> 00:00:14.259
 or I can take pictures of foul minds 

00:00:14.259 --> 00:00:16.269
 start your success 

00:00:16.269 --> 00:00:19.269
 for that is the only thing that we need peace according to 

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:22.159
 happy 

00:00:22.159 --> 00:00:25.649
 recommended that it be difficult if relatives Moscow 

00:00:27.249 --> 00:00:29.259
 these controls 

00:00:29.259 --> 00:00:32.259
 a program called pulsebeats 

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:35.950
 I'm going to teach them how to compose images 

00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:37.460
 to the parade 

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:38.789
 dedicated to one 

00:00:38.789 --> 00:00:41.490
 images of any game 

00:00:41.490 --> 00:00:44.700
 first of all we'll start by downloading the included world let down 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:47.199
 the same followed 

00:00:47.199 --> 00:00:50.570
 bush and that will be available 

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:52.780
 once downloaded uu 

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:54.650
 two folders 

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:57.410
 one if you love 

00:00:57.410 --> 00:01:01.120
 in Beijing two points 0 the other one because it looks like it's 

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:02.530
 explore 

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:05.220
 point 0 0 6 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:08.220
 the first folder 

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:12.130
 this folder 

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:18.600
 this one in the folder 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:21.600
 percent we're going to be the tlc and we're going 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:24.050
 discover 

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:27.050
 so to speak in the folders that they are going to put us 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:30.090
 first of all 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:33.330
 I have to say that her boyfriend starts that he knows who is 

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:34.840
 formatted 

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:36.440
 why the quisco 

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:39.380
 what do you mean by that what do you have to enter 

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:42.380
 options and it ends in memory and they add 

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:44.960
 no agreement he regretted 

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:48.440
 few always say only excellent match 

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:49.979
 uncertain some folders 

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:51.240
 who can not see 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:54.240
 only with the program it was surreal 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:56.840
 first to notify 

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:59.120
 the program works 

00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:00.670
 this is the injury 

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:01.650
 33 

00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:04.720
 elms with 32 

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:06.530
 it is not the best expression 

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:09.269
 for me 

00:02:09.269 --> 00:02:11.319
 will ask us to update it 

00:02:11.319 --> 00:02:13.779
 yes that is to update it to the injury 

00:02:13.779 --> 00:02:14.820
 44 

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:16.379
 you can do it 

00:02:16.379 --> 00:02:19.379
 I recommend them I think it's better 

00:02:20.579 --> 00:02:21.969
 although the 

00:02:21.969 --> 00:02:23.999
 Cardenas said 

00:02:23.999 --> 00:02:26.529
 here you have the comparison 

00:02:26.529 --> 00:02:28.929
 left today towards the iss 

00:02:28.929 --> 00:02:30.699
 the ecuador account version 

00:02:30.699 --> 00:02:33.699
 we are 

00:02:34.349 --> 00:02:37.349
 we are at this 

00:03:25.049 --> 00:03:27.799
 pablo hernández who did this to us 

00:03:27.799 --> 00:03:30.259
 we're going hamdán taha 

00:03:30.259 --> 00:03:32.129
 then happy 

00:03:32.129 --> 00:03:34.039
 it's where we're going to have to let go 

00:03:34.039 --> 00:03:37.459
 the profile of the player 

00:03:37.459 --> 00:03:40.019
 the desert there is a folder with 

00:03:40.019 --> 00:03:41.629
 and I do not think that 

00:03:41.629 --> 00:03:43.199
 in bbc 

00:03:43.199 --> 00:03:44.639
 the folder that is 

00:03:44.639 --> 00:03:47.639
 We are not going to put in the folder that is so thirsty 

00:03:49.329 --> 00:03:52.329
 then we can download profiles 

00:03:57.259 --> 00:04:00.259
 on this web page on 8 

00:04:01.869 --> 00:04:03.499
 forums 

00:04:03.499 --> 00:04:06.209
 the section between the game 

00:04:06.209 --> 00:04:09.059
 and inside games section we have several sections 

00:04:09.059 --> 00:04:11.449
 it may be the ssj 

00:04:11.449 --> 00:04:14.919
 few cantaores like 

00:04:14.919 --> 00:04:17.180
 hosaka de teatinos 

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:19.489
 we can download all kinds of this 

00:04:19.489 --> 00:04:21.419
 as before 

00:04:21.419 --> 00:04:24.419
 I was on the screen in him 

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:28.990
 the teolo hill arches the first pack of downloadable party maps 

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:32.860
 and she discharged me here works great 

00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:36.559
 and then you have to lower that sublime of this 

00:04:36.559 --> 00:04:39.319
 and these four 

00:04:39.319 --> 00:04:42.330
 these seven leagues 

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:44.610
 there is an arrangement of three races 

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:48.470
 I think this is what hides one of its limitations that the portfolio that 

00:04:48.469 --> 00:04:49.930
 he drives 

00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:51.529
 this link 

00:04:51.529 --> 00:04:52.849
 the sahara 

00:04:52.849 --> 00:04:55.659
 as 5-1 5 

00:04:55.659 --> 00:04:58.659
 it is in power in the folder 

00:04:59.469 --> 00:05:02.469
 it's going to be a number like this 

00:05:04.270 --> 00:05:06.020
 in the images of the player 

00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:08.599
 It is also going to insert here the folder where so many 

00:05:08.599 --> 00:05:10.529
 what happens that the club 

00:05:10.529 --> 00:05:13.529
 sharma specific folder 

00:05:14.330 --> 00:05:17.330
 3 the fis 

00:05:18.219 --> 00:05:19.409
 inside this one 

00:05:19.409 --> 00:05:20.960
 we will go 

00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:23.509
 to this street 

00:05:23.509 --> 00:05:25.099
 let's put the images 

00:05:25.099 --> 00:05:27.990
 is that we are left 

00:05:27.990 --> 00:05:30.279
 I stopped to see the images 

00:05:30.279 --> 00:05:32.319
 It's very simple 

00:05:32.319 --> 00:05:34.629
 what we have to do 

00:05:34.629 --> 00:05:36.249
 as always is april 

00:05:36.249 --> 00:05:39.249
 Folder 

00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:51.180
 put the pictures makes us feel you do not need and a lot of them are just 

00:05:51.180 --> 00:05:52.270
 the program 

00:05:52.270 --> 00:05:54.099
 miguel vs 

00:05:54.099 --> 00:05:57.099
 you need to do a second 

00:05:57.610 --> 00:05:59.919
 first of all before it deserves 

00:05:59.919 --> 00:06:02.300
 this in the region of the game 

00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:04.469
 in the united states and spain 

00:06:04.469 --> 00:06:06.369
 Great Britain whatever 

00:06:06.369 --> 00:06:09.759
 I recommend that you do not touch the United States cap 

00:06:09.759 --> 00:06:11.990
 canceled most 

00:06:11.990 --> 00:06:13.210
 here you can search 

00:06:13.210 --> 00:06:14.599
 Any game 

00:06:14.599 --> 00:06:17.619
 for example 

00:06:17.619 --> 00:06:20.619
 Carlos Delfino 

00:06:22.089 --> 00:06:25.789
 when you have is the game ancona calculates that you want cities of the 

00:06:25.789 --> 00:06:28.879
 fishing 

00:06:28.879 --> 00:06:31.879
 start looking for the goal of honor 

00:06:33.080 --> 00:06:36.080
 these are the images that we are going to have 

00:06:41.710 --> 00:06:42.710
 it hurt 

00:06:42.710 --> 00:06:44.999
 that for her 

00:06:44.999 --> 00:06:46.990
 there are more pictures 

00:06:46.990 --> 00:06:48.589
 if someone dares 

00:06:48.589 --> 00:06:51.949
 If they want me to continue looking for a bank among many more 

00:06:51.949 --> 00:06:54.219
 once we have these futures 

00:06:54.219 --> 00:06:57.219
 what we are going to have to do is select 

00:06:58.580 --> 00:07:01.860
 cobos langley 

00:07:01.860 --> 00:07:04.000
 after a thorough analysis 

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:05.569
 steve jobs 

00:07:05.569 --> 00:07:08.569
 we arrived here 

00:07:10.659 --> 00:07:13.659
 as very confident images 

00:07:15.389 --> 00:07:18.389
 and there it begins 

00:07:19.529 --> 00:07:22.360
 the overweight 

00:07:22.360 --> 00:07:23.909
 once we have this 

00:07:23.909 --> 00:07:26.909
 what we should not do is insert this file 

00:07:27.889 --> 00:07:30.589
 the folder that before those facts 

00:07:30.589 --> 00:07:33.589
 then repeat between the contain the road with 

00:07:35.229 --> 00:07:36.139
 down here 

00:07:36.139 --> 00:07:37.080
 in the folder 

00:07:37.080 --> 00:07:38.649
 with three fish 

00:07:38.649 --> 00:07:41.050
 at first 

00:07:41.050 --> 00:07:44.050
 your folder 

00:07:44.860 --> 00:07:47.860
 here we even have to show you your 

00:07:49.789 --> 00:07:51.419
 there was a state crisis 

00:07:51.419 --> 00:07:53.960
 mobile and in eighth place 

00:07:53.960 --> 00:07:56.110
 and calm 

00:07:56.110 --> 00:07:59.559
 the only thing you have to do then 

00:07:59.559 --> 00:08:01.719
 Intralinks avoid profile 

00:08:01.719 --> 00:08:04.210
 I insi the stage an image 

00:08:04.210 --> 00:08:07.210
 yesterday go sant 

00:08:08.270 --> 00:08:09.830
 That's all for today 

00:08:09.830 --> 00:08:12.909
 I hope they do it without detainees and that according to 

00:08:12.909 --> 00:08:15.520
 descend a collapse 

00:08:15.520 --> 00:08:16.509
 and nothing more 

00:08:16.509 --> 00:08:17.149
 until another
