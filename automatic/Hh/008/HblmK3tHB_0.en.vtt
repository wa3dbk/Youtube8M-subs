needle<00:00:58.620> and<00:00:59.870> I<00:01:00.870> have<00:01:01.050> two<00:01:01.230> different<00:01:01.559> size

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
needle and I have two different size

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:04.160 
needle and I have two different size
hooks<00:01:02.010> that<00:01:02.219> I<00:01:02.280> used<00:01:02.520> in<00:01:02.670> this<00:01:02.789> project<00:01:03.449> one<00:01:03.899> is

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
hooks that I used in this project one is

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:06.740 
hooks that I used in this project one is
the<00:01:04.439> size<00:01:04.710> N<00:01:05.070> or<00:01:05.489> 10<00:01:05.790> millimeter<00:01:06.240> which<00:01:06.450> is<00:01:06.479> the

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
the size N or 10 millimeter which is the

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:09.609 
the size N or 10 millimeter which is the
pink<00:01:06.990> one<00:01:07.229> and<00:01:07.500> the<00:01:08.220> other<00:01:08.340> one<00:01:08.490> was<00:01:08.670> a<00:01:08.700> size<00:01:08.970> J

00:01:09.609 --> 00:01:09.619 
pink one and the other one was a size J

00:01:09.619 --> 00:01:14.980 
pink one and the other one was a size J
and<00:01:10.619> I<00:01:10.710> think<00:01:11.100> that<00:01:11.430> is<00:01:11.729> the<00:01:12.740> six<00:01:13.740> millimeter

00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:14.990 
and I think that is the six millimeter

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:18.320 
and I think that is the six millimeter
pair<00:01:15.990> of<00:01:16.080> scissors<00:01:16.909> and<00:01:17.909> these<00:01:18.119> are<00:01:18.240> the

pair of scissors and these are the

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:20.510 
pair of scissors and these are the
pieces<00:01:18.479> that<00:01:18.840> we<00:01:19.020> have<00:01:19.049> crocheted<00:01:19.979> everything

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
pieces that we have crocheted everything

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:22.940 
pieces that we have crocheted everything
has<00:01:20.610> done<00:01:20.759> a<00:01:20.790> double<00:01:21.030> crochet<00:01:21.560> this<00:01:22.560> is<00:01:22.799> the

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
has done a double crochet this is the

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:25.850 
has done a double crochet this is the
large<00:01:23.159> triangle<00:01:23.580> for<00:01:24.060> the<00:01:24.090> back<00:01:24.330> and<00:01:24.720> it<00:01:25.710> is

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
large triangle for the back and it is

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:28.940 
large triangle for the back and it is
nine<00:01:26.420> rows<00:01:27.420> or<00:01:27.960> circles<00:01:28.439> that's<00:01:28.619> how<00:01:28.710> you<00:01:28.770> can

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950 
nine rows or circles that's how you can

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:31.999 
nine rows or circles that's how you can
count<00:01:29.100> how<00:01:29.310> big<00:01:29.520> it<00:01:29.640> is<00:01:30.409> just<00:01:31.409> by<00:01:31.530> counting

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:32.009 
count how big it is just by counting

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:34.010 
count how big it is just by counting
these<00:01:32.159> little<00:01:32.460> holes<00:01:32.640> and<00:01:33.060> there<00:01:33.689> are<00:01:33.810> nine

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
these little holes and there are nine

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:38.719 
these little holes and there are nine
and<00:01:35.450> then<00:01:36.450> we<00:01:36.630> have<00:01:36.810> a<00:01:36.840> small<00:01:37.259> one<00:01:37.530> and<00:01:37.799> it<00:01:38.549> is

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:38.729 
and then we have a small one and it is

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:41.630 
and then we have a small one and it is
three<00:01:39.180> rows<00:01:39.650> this<00:01:40.650> one<00:01:40.860> is<00:01:40.979> really<00:01:41.130> simple<00:01:41.549> you

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 
three rows this one is really simple you

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:43.840 
three rows this one is really simple you
can<00:01:41.790> make<00:01:41.939> this<00:01:42.060> one<00:01:42.210> up<00:01:42.360> in<00:01:42.479> like<00:01:42.630> 15<00:01:43.020> minutes

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:43.850 
can make this one up in like 15 minutes

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:46.789 
can make this one up in like 15 minutes
and<00:01:44.850> then<00:01:45.270> I<00:01:45.299> did<00:01:45.570> put<00:01:45.840> some<00:01:46.140> baubles<00:01:46.530> on<00:01:46.680> the

see if I can get an angle so that you
can<00:02:15.000> see<00:02:15.209> that<00:02:15.420> they<00:02:15.959> stick<00:02:16.290> out<00:02:16.470> a<00:02:16.770> little

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:16.800 
can see that they stick out a little

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:19.160 
can see that they stick out a little
puffy<00:02:17.310> and<00:02:18.000> I'm<00:02:18.270> not<00:02:18.420> sure<00:02:18.599> if<00:02:18.750> I'm<00:02:18.900> going<00:02:19.080> to

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:19.170 
puffy and I'm not sure if I'm going to

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:22.309 
puffy and I'm not sure if I'm going to
keep<00:02:19.530> that<00:02:19.709> or<00:02:19.890> not<00:02:20.010> but<00:02:20.190> we'll<00:02:20.370> sink<00:02:21.260> so<00:02:22.260> you

00:02:22.309 --> 00:02:22.319 
keep that or not but we'll sink so you

00:02:22.319 --> 00:02:23.809 
keep that or not but we'll sink so you
need<00:02:22.560> the<00:02:22.650> two<00:02:22.830> rectangles

00:02:23.809 --> 00:02:23.819 
need the two rectangles

00:02:23.819 --> 00:02:27.559 
need the two rectangles
they're<00:02:24.180> both<00:02:24.360> 22<00:02:24.930> rows<00:02:25.200> and<00:02:26.300> the<00:02:27.300> two

00:02:27.559 --> 00:02:27.569 
they're both 22 rows and the two

00:02:27.569 --> 00:02:36.920 
they're both 22 rows and the two
triangles<00:02:28.500> and<00:02:30.470> that's<00:02:31.470> it<00:02:35.690> so<00:02:36.690> hopefully

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:36.930 
triangles and that's it so hopefully

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:40.370 
triangles and that's it so hopefully
you'll<00:02:37.230> try<00:02:37.410> this<00:02:37.440> project<00:02:37.800> with<00:02:38.160> me
