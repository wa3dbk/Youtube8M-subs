00:00:13.741 --> 00:00:15.841
 Most people like to eat pizza, 

00:00:15.841 --> 00:00:17.567
 But it can be chaotic. 

00:00:17.567 --> 00:00:21.385
 The pizza is soft and bendable, so how can you stop all that cheese from falling? 

00:00:21.385 --> 00:00:22.886
 You may know some of the tricks: 

00:00:22.886 --> 00:00:23.821
 You can use hands Monday, 

00:00:23.821 --> 00:00:24.758
 Not very neat, 

00:00:24.758 --> 00:00:26.090
 Or you can use a paper plate 

00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:28.792
 And just let the pizza head out. 

00:00:28.792 --> 00:00:29.899
 There is another trick: 

00:00:29.899 --> 00:00:33.222
 Pasting the crust, you can somehow collapse a piece of pizza in the middle. 

00:00:33.222 --> 00:00:35.137
 Now the pizza party is not falling, 

00:00:35.137 --> 00:00:37.964
 You can eat them without finding tomato sauce all over yourself 

00:00:37.964 --> 00:00:40.770
 Or accidentally bite some of that paper dish 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:43.897
 But, why should the head stay on top just because you cut the crust? 

00:00:43.897 --> 00:00:46.240
 To understand this, you need to know two things: 

00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:48.314
 A little about mathematical curved shapes, 

00:00:48.314 --> 00:00:50.886
 And a little about thin sheet physics. 

00:00:50.886 --> 00:00:51.965
 First, mathematics. 

00:00:51.965 --> 00:00:54.044
 Suppose I have a sheet made of rubber. 

00:00:54.044 --> 00:00:57.664
 It's very thin and bendable, so it's easy to fold it into a cylinder. 

00:00:57.664 --> 00:01:00.423
 I do not need to extend the paper at all, just bend it. 

00:01:00.423 --> 00:01:03.326
 This property is where one shape can be converted to another 

00:01:03.326 --> 00:01:06.362
 Without stretch or wrinkle called equal dimensional. 

00:01:06.362 --> 00:01:10.244
 The mathematician would say that the flat plate is equal to the cylinder. 

00:01:10.244 --> 00:01:11.995
 However, not all shapes are of equal dimensions. 

00:01:11.995 --> 00:01:14.745
 If you try to convert two plane sheets to a part of a ball, 

00:01:14.745 --> 00:01:16.021
 There is no way for me to do that. 

00:01:16.021 --> 00:01:17.998
 You can check this yourself by trying to contain 

00:01:17.998 --> 00:01:19.975
 Flat sheet of paper on a football 

00:01:19.975 --> 00:01:21.843
 Without stretching or wrinkling the paper. 

00:01:21.843 --> 00:01:23.292
 it's not possible. 

00:01:23.292 --> 00:01:24.497
 So the mathematician will say 

00:01:24.497 --> 00:01:27.778
 The flat plate and the ball are not equal in dimensions. 

00:01:27.778 --> 00:01:30.010
 There is more than a familiar form is not equal dimensions 

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:31.914
 For any of the formats we've seen so far: 

00:01:31.914 --> 00:01:32.893
 Potato chip. 

00:01:32.893 --> 00:01:35.496
 The potato chip is not equal to the flat sheets. 

00:01:35.496 --> 00:01:38.615
 If you want to get a flat piece of rubber in the form of potato chips, 

00:01:38.615 --> 00:01:39.915
 You need to provide it, 

00:01:39.915 --> 00:01:42.148
 Not only bend it, but extend it too. 

00:01:42.148 --> 00:01:43.537
 So, that is mathematics. 

00:01:43.537 --> 00:01:44.750
 Not too difficult, right? 

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:45.944
 Now for physics. 

00:01:45.944 --> 00:01:47.714
 Can be summed up in one sentence: 

00:01:47.714 --> 00:01:50.655
 Thin sheets are easy to bend but hard to stretch. 

00:01:50.655 --> 00:01:52.361
 This is very important. 

00:01:52.361 --> 00:01:55.486
 Thin sheets are easy to bend but hard to stretch. 

00:01:55.486 --> 00:01:58.523
 Remember when we rolled our flat sheet of rubber into a cylinder? 

00:01:58.523 --> 00:01:59.813
 That was not hard, was it? 

00:01:59.813 --> 00:02:01.868
 But imagine how difficult it is to draw on paper 

00:02:01.868 --> 00:02:04.008
 To increase its area by 10%. 

00:02:04.008 --> 00:02:05.587
 It will be very difficult. 

00:02:05.587 --> 00:02:09.292
 The goal is to bend a thin plate takes a relatively small amount of force, 

00:02:09.292 --> 00:02:12.735
 But a D-wrinkle or thin newspaper is much harder. 

00:02:12.735 --> 00:02:15.426
 Now, finally, we get to talk about pizza. 

00:02:15.426 --> 00:02:18.322
 Suppose you went to a pizza restaurant and bought yourself a piece of pizza. 

00:02:18.322 --> 00:02:21.303
 Hold it from the crust, first, without bending. 

00:02:21.303 --> 00:02:24.075
 Because of gravity, the piece bends down. 

00:02:24.075 --> 00:02:25.758
 After all, the pizza is very thin 

00:02:25.758 --> 00:02:28.305
 We know that thin sheets are easy to bend. 

00:02:28.305 --> 00:02:29.515
 You can not insert them into your mouth, 

00:02:29.515 --> 00:02:31.293
 Cheese and tomato sauce are falling everywhere, 

00:02:31.293 --> 00:02:32.425
 It's a big mess. 

00:02:32.425 --> 00:02:33.414
 So degrade the crust. 

00:02:33.414 --> 00:02:36.660
 When you do this, force the pizza shape into something like a tacos. 

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:38.109
 It is not difficult to do so. 

00:02:38.109 --> 00:02:41.920
 After all, this shape is equally dimensional to the original pizza, which was flat. 

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:44.864
 But imagine what would happen if the pizza fell down 

00:02:44.864 --> 00:02:46.329
 While you bend it. 

00:02:46.329 --> 00:02:48.224
 Now look like a tacos. 

00:02:48.224 --> 00:02:49.940
 And how does the tacos look swaying? 

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:51.047
 Potato chip! 

00:02:51.047 --> 00:02:54.878
 But we know that the potato chips are not equal to the dimensions of a flat piece of rubber, 

00:02:54.878 --> 00:02:56.337
 Or flat pizzas 

00:02:56.337 --> 00:02:58.805
 This means that in order to get the form in which it is now, 

00:02:58.805 --> 00:03:00.925
 The pizza piece had to be stretched. 

00:03:00.925 --> 00:03:03.593
 Because pizza is thin, this requires a lot of strength, 

00:03:03.593 --> 00:03:05.221
 Compared to the amount of force that it takes 

00:03:05.221 --> 00:03:06.965
 To discourage the pizza in the first place. 

00:03:06.965 --> 00:03:08.993
 So, what is the conclusion? 

00:03:08.993 --> 00:03:10.708
 When you praise pizza at the crust, 

00:03:10.708 --> 00:03:14.095
 Make it in shape where a lot of force is needed to bend the tip down. 

00:03:14.095 --> 00:03:16.974
 Gravity is often not strong enough to provide this strength. 

00:03:16.974 --> 00:03:18.411
 So it was quite a lot of information, 

00:03:18.411 --> 00:03:20.369
 So let us make a quick summary back. 

00:03:20.369 --> 00:03:22.140
 When the pizza is folded into the crust, 

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:24.033
 Gravity is not strong enough to bend the edge. 

00:03:24.033 --> 00:03:24.648
 Why? 

00:03:24.648 --> 00:03:26.481
 Because bending the pizza is difficult 

00:03:26.481 --> 00:03:27.705
 And bend the head down 

00:03:27.705 --> 00:03:29.250
 The pizza must be stretched. 

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:29.872
 Why? 

00:03:29.872 --> 00:03:31.622
 Because the shape of the pizza, 

00:03:31.622 --> 00:03:32.818
 Tacos, 

00:03:32.818 --> 00:03:35.210
 It is not an asymmetrical shape of the original flat pizza. 

00:03:35.210 --> 00:03:35.812
 Why? 

00:03:35.812 --> 00:03:37.372
 Because of mathematics. 

00:03:37.372 --> 00:03:38.772
 As shown in the pizza example, 

00:03:38.772 --> 00:03:42.337
 We can learn a lot by looking at the mathematical properties of various shapes. 

00:03:42.337 --> 00:03:45.315
 And it's especially nice when those pizza sliced ​​shapes.
