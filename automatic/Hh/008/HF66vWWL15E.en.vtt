00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:24.090 

even<00:00:21.970> the<00:00:22.150> body<00:00:22.360> dies<00:00:22.630> but<00:00:22.960> we<00:00:23.200> are<00:00:23.590> always<00:00:23.830> the

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:24.100 
even the body dies but we are always the

00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:27.990 
even the body dies but we are always the
observer<00:00:24.460> and<00:00:24.670> even<00:00:25.060> after<00:00:25.360> death<00:00:25.890> all<00:00:27.000> what

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:28.000 
observer and even after death all what

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.220 
observer and even after death all what
we<00:00:28.119> have<00:00:28.300> to<00:00:28.450> do<00:00:28.660> is<00:00:30.720> you<00:00:31.720> know<00:00:31.840> we're

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:32.230 
we have to do is you know we're

00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:36.000 
we have to do is you know we're
constantly<00:00:32.559> observing<00:00:33.190> in<00:00:33.400> some<00:00:33.700> form<00:00:34.150> and<00:00:35.010> we

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:36.010 
constantly observing in some form and we

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:42.260 
constantly observing in some form and we
don't<00:00:36.130> remember<00:00:37.020> that<00:00:38.020> we<00:00:38.230> were<00:00:38.410> Galileo<00:00:40.110> like

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270 
don't remember that we were Galileo like

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:46.410 
don't remember that we were Galileo like
because<00:00:43.270> we're<00:00:43.840> always<00:00:44.050> in<00:00:44.440> a<00:00:44.530> new<00:00:44.650> form<00:00:45.420> with

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:46.420 
because we're always in a new form with

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:49.049 
because we're always in a new form with
a<00:00:46.449> new<00:00:46.750> new<00:00:47.260> name<00:00:47.830> and<00:00:48.129> a<00:00:48.250> new<00:00:48.280> fresh

00:00:49.049 --> 00:00:49.059 
a new new name and a new fresh

00:00:49.059 --> 00:00:52.500 
a new new name and a new fresh
perspective<00:00:49.690> on<00:00:49.809> reality<00:00:50.160> and<00:00:51.160> we<00:00:52.090> have<00:00:52.330> to

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:52.510 
perspective on reality and we have to

00:00:52.510 --> 00:01:00.049 
perspective on reality and we have to
learn<00:00:52.690> to<00:00:56.820> understand<00:00:57.820> ourselves<00:00:59.040> quicker

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
learn to understand ourselves quicker

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:04.499 
learn to understand ourselves quicker
and<00:01:01.059> it's<00:01:01.719> so<00:01:02.140> hard<00:01:02.530> to<00:01:02.649> do<00:01:03.010> that<00:01:03.180> that's<00:01:04.180> the

00:01:04.499 --> 00:01:04.509 
and it's so hard to do that that's the

00:01:04.509 --> 00:01:06.029 
and it's so hard to do that that's the
that's<00:01:04.780> the<00:01:04.930> hardest<00:01:05.259> thing<00:01:05.379> for<00:01:05.530> Humanity<00:01:05.950> to

00:01:06.029 --> 00:01:06.039 
that's the hardest thing for Humanity to

00:01:06.039 --> 00:01:09.389 
that's the hardest thing for Humanity to
do<00:01:06.190> is<00:01:06.310> to<00:01:06.430> understand<00:01:06.880> itself<00:01:08.009> so<00:01:09.009> if<00:01:09.250> people

00:01:09.389 --> 00:01:09.399 
do is to understand itself so if people

00:01:09.399 --> 00:01:10.800 
do is to understand itself so if people
have<00:01:09.610> struggled<00:01:09.970> with<00:01:10.060> it<00:01:10.180> for<00:01:10.210> years<00:01:10.390> and<00:01:10.630> you

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:10.810 
have struggled with it for years and you

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:12.180 
have struggled with it for years and you
see<00:01:10.990> like<00:01:11.020> every<00:01:11.350> once<00:01:11.500> in<00:01:11.590> a<00:01:11.649> while<00:01:11.740> you<00:01:11.770> like

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:12.190 
see like every once in a while you like

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:13.469 
see like every once in a while you like
somebody<00:01:12.490> that<00:01:12.610> really<00:01:12.850> understands

00:01:13.469 --> 00:01:13.479 
somebody that really understands

00:01:13.479 --> 00:01:17.670 
somebody that really understands
themselves<00:01:14.140> and<00:01:15.750> people<00:01:16.750> Harold<00:01:17.350> them<00:01:17.530> is

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:17.680 
themselves and people Harold them is

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:19.620 
themselves and people Harold them is
like<00:01:17.800> a<00:01:17.830> prophet<00:01:18.369> or<00:01:18.460> some<00:01:18.700> some<00:01:19.240> they<00:01:19.479> put

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:19.630 
like a prophet or some some they put

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:20.730 
like a prophet or some some they put
them<00:01:19.750> up<00:01:19.810> on<00:01:19.899> a<00:01:19.960> pedestal<00:01:20.110> and<00:01:20.440> that's<00:01:20.590> the

00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:20.740 
them up on a pedestal and that's the

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:22.740 
them up on a pedestal and that's the
problem<00:01:20.950> because<00:01:21.729> everyone<00:01:22.090> can<00:01:22.300> understand

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:22.750 
problem because everyone can understand

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:24.719 
problem because everyone can understand
themselves<00:01:22.930> and<00:01:23.500> some<00:01:24.220> people<00:01:24.430> just<00:01:24.550> likes

00:01:24.719 --> 00:01:24.729 
themselves and some people just likes

00:01:24.729 --> 00:01:25.859 
themselves and some people just likes
always<00:01:25.180> like<00:01:25.270> they<00:01:25.360> slip<00:01:25.600> through<00:01:25.750> the<00:01:25.840> cracks

00:01:25.859 --> 00:01:25.869 
always like they slip through the cracks

00:01:25.869 --> 00:01:29.039 
always like they slip through the cracks
and<00:01:26.470> somehow<00:01:26.950> come<00:01:27.939> away<00:01:28.060> with<00:01:28.180> like<00:01:28.510> this

00:01:29.039 --> 00:01:29.049 
and somehow come away with like this

00:01:29.049 --> 00:01:33.510 
and somehow come away with like this
understanding<00:01:31.799> but<00:01:32.799> I<00:01:32.860> think<00:01:33.189> that<00:01:33.220> it's<00:01:33.400> not

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:33.520 
understanding but I think that it's not

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:34.800 
understanding but I think that it's not
really<00:01:33.729> slipping<00:01:34.000> through<00:01:34.119> the<00:01:34.150> cracks<00:01:34.210> it's

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:34.810 
really slipping through the cracks it's

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:37.230 
really slipping through the cracks it's
just<00:01:34.960> like<00:01:35.110> some<00:01:35.439> people<00:01:35.920> are<00:01:36.040> raised<00:01:36.759> really

00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:37.240 
just like some people are raised really

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:41.160 
just like some people are raised really
well<00:01:37.540> and<00:01:37.930> are<00:01:38.820> nurtured<00:01:39.820> to<00:01:39.970> think<00:01:40.390> and<00:01:40.960> a<00:01:41.020> lot

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:41.170 
well and are nurtured to think and a lot

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:42.749 
well and are nurtured to think and a lot
of<00:01:41.200> times<00:01:41.409> it<00:01:41.590> comes<00:01:41.710> in<00:01:41.920> societies<00:01:42.490> when

00:01:42.749 --> 00:01:42.759 
of times it comes in societies when

00:01:42.759 --> 00:01:44.700 
of times it comes in societies when
people<00:01:43.150> don't<00:01:43.659> have<00:01:43.869> to<00:01:43.930> fight<00:01:44.350> for<00:01:44.590> their

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:44.710 
people don't have to fight for their

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:47.370 
people don't have to fight for their
food<00:01:44.950> they're<00:01:45.130> not<00:01:45.250> struggling<00:01:46.380> physically

00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:47.380 
food they're not struggling physically

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:51.770 
food they're not struggling physically
much<00:01:48.250> you<00:01:49.090> live<00:01:49.270> in<00:01:49.299> like<00:01:49.540> a<00:01:49.570> safe<00:01:50.110> environment

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:51.780 
much you live in like a safe environment

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:54.450 
much you live in like a safe environment
somehow<00:01:52.780> maybe<00:01:53.079> I<00:01:53.380> don't<00:01:53.500> know<00:01:53.710> there's<00:01:54.130> other

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:54.460 
somehow maybe I don't know there's other

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:58.830 
somehow maybe I don't know there's other
people<00:01:56.280> sometimes<00:01:57.280> people<00:01:57.610> just<00:01:57.790> really<00:01:58.630> get

00:01:58.830 --> 00:01:58.840 
people sometimes people just really get

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:02.310 
people sometimes people just really get
it<00:01:58.960> quickly<00:01:59.200> I<00:02:00.240> think<00:02:01.240> the<00:02:01.479> way<00:02:01.930> that<00:02:01.960> happens

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:02.320 
it quickly I think the way that happens

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:07.319 
it quickly I think the way that happens
is<00:02:02.619> if<00:02:02.740> you're<00:02:02.920> told<00:02:03.250> it<00:02:05.070> people<00:02:06.070> tell<00:02:06.340> you<00:02:06.579> if

00:02:07.319 --> 00:02:07.329 
is if you're told it people tell you if

00:02:07.329 --> 00:02:13.210 
is if you're told it people tell you if
your<00:02:07.509> parents<00:02:08.049> are<00:02:10.500> understand<00:02:11.500> themselves

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:13.220 
your parents are understand themselves

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:14.950 
your parents are understand themselves
and<00:02:13.580> they<00:02:13.880> communicate<00:02:14.390> with<00:02:14.420> you<00:02:14.750> when

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:14.960 
and they communicate with you when

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:19.060 
and they communicate with you when
you're<00:02:15.050> a<00:02:15.110> child<00:02:16.750> then<00:02:17.750> you<00:02:18.470> will<00:02:18.590> understand

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:19.070 
you're a child then you will understand

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:21.610 
you're a child then you will understand
yourself<00:02:19.190> as<00:02:19.490> a<00:02:19.520> child<00:02:19.850> and<00:02:20.300> you'll<00:02:20.540> have<00:02:21.260> such

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:21.620 
yourself as a child and you'll have such

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:23.410 
yourself as a child and you'll have such
a<00:02:21.890> balanced<00:02:22.610> perspective<00:02:22.760> of<00:02:23.390> reality

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:23.420 
a balanced perspective of reality

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:27.580 
a balanced perspective of reality
