there's no guarantee that it's organic

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:59.510 
there's no guarantee that it's organic
so<00:00:57.420> I<00:00:57.449> just<00:00:57.719> use<00:00:57.899> it<00:00:58.050> on<00:00:58.140> our<00:00:58.520> flowerbeds

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520 
so I just use it on our flowerbeds

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:02.450 
so I just use it on our flowerbeds
around<00:01:00.239> our<00:01:00.420> house<00:01:00.660> and<00:01:01.020> I<00:01:01.739> get<00:01:02.100> a<00:01:02.129> different

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
around our house and I get a different

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
one for our vegetable beds but this

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:07.550 
one for our vegetable beds but this
works<00:01:04.710> great<00:01:05.010> it's<00:01:05.760> economical<00:01:06.600> I<00:01:06.840> like<00:01:07.350> it

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 
works great it's economical I like it

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:11.060 
works great it's economical I like it
that<00:01:07.770> it<00:01:08.070> is<00:01:08.310> dark<00:01:08.939> like<00:01:09.409> really<00:01:10.409> rich<00:01:10.619> dirt

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
that it is dark like really rich dirt

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:14.170 
that it is dark like really rich dirt
and<00:01:11.310> it<00:01:11.880> feeds<00:01:12.299> the<00:01:12.450> soil<00:01:12.780> as<00:01:13.080> it<00:01:13.320> breaks<00:01:13.470> down

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:14.180 
and it feeds the soil as it breaks down

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:18.289 
and it feeds the soil as it breaks down
which<00:01:15.180> is<00:01:15.420> different<00:01:15.900> than<00:01:16.200> just<00:01:16.229> a<00:01:16.830> pine<00:01:17.299> bark

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:18.299

and it just grows and there's no way no
amount<00:01:57.329> of<00:01:57.479> digging<00:01:57.840> is<00:01:57.990> going<00:01:58.259> to<00:01:58.380> make<00:01:59.070> it

00:01:59.179 --> 00:01:59.189 
amount of digging is going to make it

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:01.399 
amount of digging is going to make it
disappear<00:01:59.340> so<00:01:59.939> I<00:01:59.969> can<00:02:00.210> keep<00:02:00.450> it<00:02:00.600> under<00:02:00.840> control

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:01.409 
disappear so I can keep it under control

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:04.330 
disappear so I can keep it under control
by<00:02:02.040> covering<00:02:02.640> it<00:02:02.820> with<00:02:03.270> a<00:02:03.329> heavy<00:02:03.630> layer<00:02:03.930> of

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:04.340 
by covering it with a heavy layer of

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:07.590 
by covering it with a heavy layer of
newspaper<00:02:05.340> and<00:02:05.670> then<00:02:06.030> mulch<00:02:06.270> on

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:07.600 
newspaper and then mulch on

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:10.300 
newspaper and then mulch on
depending<00:02:08.600> on<00:02:08.720> where<00:02:09.080> you're<00:02:09.410> laying<00:02:09.679> this

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:10.310

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:19.040 
these are just one page thick so these

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:20.470
