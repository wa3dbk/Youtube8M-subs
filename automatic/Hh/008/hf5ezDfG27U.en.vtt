00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:01.920 
GTX 780 superclocked SC I think SV

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:06.280 
GTX 780 superclocked SC I think SV
stands<00:02:02.250> for<00:02:02.460> super<00:02:02.579> clock<00:02:03.000> with<00:02:03.659> a<00:02:03.689> AMD<00:02:04.399> 8350

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:06.290 
stands for super clock with a AMD 8350

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:08.900 
stands for super clock with a AMD 8350
it's<00:02:07.290> got<00:02:07.530> these<00:02:07.740> I<00:02:08.160> think<00:02:08.280> they're<00:02:08.550> knocked

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:08.910 
it's got these I think they're knocked

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:12.850 
this thing

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:16.260 
this thing
I<00:02:12.990> rarely<00:02:13.990> here<00:02:14.470> and<00:02:14.620> unless<00:02:14.740> some<00:02:15.040> plane<00:02:15.370> have

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:16.270 
I rarely here and unless some plane have

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:20.220 
I rarely here and unless some plane have
a<00:02:16.300> we<00:02:16.600> some<00:02:17.380> video<00:02:17.650> games<00:02:18.240> cause<00:02:19.240> Spotify<00:02:19.930> here

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:20.230 
a we some video games cause Spotify here

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:25.520 
a we some video games cause Spotify here

recommend<00:02:33.970> those<00:02:34.120> programs<00:02:34.780> and<00:02:35.230> then<00:02:35.560> I<00:02:35.650> have

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:35.770 
recommend those programs and then I have

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:39.540 
recommend those programs and then I have
the<00:02:35.890> second<00:02:36.310> monitor<00:02:36.960> just<00:02:37.960> helps<00:02:38.320> me<00:02:38.950> have<00:02:39.490> a

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:39.550 
the second monitor just helps me have a

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:42.660 
the second monitor just helps me have a
little<00:02:39.910> better<00:02:40.120> workflow<00:02:41.460> keyboard<00:02:42.460> is

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:42.670 
little better workflow keyboard is

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:46.190 
little better workflow keyboard is
pretty<00:02:43.030> dirty<00:02:43.330> it's<00:02:43.750> um<00:02:44.200> the<00:02:44.530> logic<00:02:45.340> logic

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:46.200 
pretty dirty it's um the logic logic

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:47.700 
pretty dirty it's um the logic logic
