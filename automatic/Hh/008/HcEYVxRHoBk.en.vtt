00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:25.740 
about it well initially started with the

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:28.700 
about it well initially started with the
idea<00:00:26.010> of<00:00:26.039> doing<00:00:26.189> a<00:00:26.310> heresy<00:00:26.730> campaign<00:00:27.710> called

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:28.710 
idea of doing a heresy campaign called

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:31.189 
idea of doing a heresy campaign called
the<00:00:28.890> army<00:00:29.310> and<00:00:29.760> we<00:00:29.910> want<00:00:30.269> to<00:00:30.390> recreate<00:00:30.929> some<00:00:31.170> of

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:31.199 
the army and we want to recreate some of

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:33.920 
the army and we want to recreate some of
the<00:00:31.289> battles<00:00:31.619> of<00:00:31.710> the<00:00:31.769> heresy<00:00:32.309> and<00:00:33.000> we<00:00:33.690> said

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:33.930 
the battles of the heresy and we said

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:35.290 
the battles of the heresy and we said
well<00:00:34.079> we're<00:00:34.230> going<00:00:34.350> to<00:00:34.410> end<00:00:34.500> up<00:00:34.590> with<00:00:34.649> the<00:00:34.920> seed

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:35.300 
well we're going to end up with the seed

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:37.880 
well we're going to end up with the seed
apparently<00:00:36.300> so<00:00:36.600> and<00:00:36.960> with<00:00:37.110> the<00:00:37.230> hackers<00:00:37.620> are

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890 
apparently so and with the hackers are

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:40.639 
apparently so and with the hackers are
building<00:00:38.340> their<00:00:38.460> first<00:00:38.930> absolutely<00:00:39.930> IDs<00:00:40.500> turn

00:00:40.639 --> 00:00:40.649 
building their first absolutely IDs turn

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:43.549 
building their first absolutely IDs turn
into<00:00:40.860> another<00:00:40.950> so<00:00:41.629> I'll<00:00:42.629> get<00:00:42.840> that<00:00:42.989> I<00:00:43.050> ended<00:00:43.469> up

00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:43.559 
into another so I'll get that I ended up

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:45.470 
into another so I'll get that I ended up
with<00:00:43.620> this<00:00:43.829> and<00:00:44.550> so<00:00:44.730> this<00:00:44.850> of<00:00:45.030> course<00:00:45.059> is<00:00:45.329> the

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480
