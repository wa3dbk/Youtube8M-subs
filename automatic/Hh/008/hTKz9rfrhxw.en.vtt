which i think is fantastic because then

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:10.450 
which i think is fantastic because then
it<00:01:09.020> ensures<00:01:09.620> that<00:01:09.650> it's<00:01:09.920> gonna<00:01:10.040> get<00:01:10.250> you

00:01:58.929 --> 00:01:58.939 
deal with noisy external pumps which i

00:01:58.939 --> 00:02:02.200 
deal with noisy external pumps which i
think<00:01:59.000> is<00:01:59.270> great<00:01:59.619> so<00:02:00.619> this<00:02:00.860> is<00:02:01.100> rated<00:02:01.670> at

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:02.210 
think is great so this is rated at

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:04.569 
think is great so this is rated at
around<00:02:02.659> 300<00:02:03.409> litres<00:02:03.680> per<00:02:03.770> hour<00:02:04.040> but<00:02:04.369> it<00:02:04.490> should

00:02:04.569 --> 00:02:04.579 
around 300 litres per hour but it should

00:02:04.579 --> 00:02:07.359 
around 300 litres per hour but it should
actually<00:02:04.729> be<00:02:04.909> above<00:02:05.360> that<00:02:05.390> usually<00:02:05.930> about<00:02:06.369> 325

00:02:07.359 --> 00:02:07.369 
actually be above that usually about 325

00:02:07.369 --> 00:02:09.710 
actually be above that usually about 325
litres<00:02:08.360> per<00:02:08.390> hours<00:02:08.869> where<00:02:09.050> this<00:02:09.170> is<00:02:09.319> a

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:09.720 
litres per hours where this is a

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:12.830 
litres per hours where this is a
so<00:02:09.810> the<00:02:09.899> flow<00:02:10.680> rated<00:02:11.250> at<00:02:11.430> so<00:02:11.700> an<00:02:11.840> extremely

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:12.840 
so the flow rated at so an extremely

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:15.470 
so the flow rated at so an extremely
extremely<00:02:13.560> high<00:02:14.340> flowing<00:02:14.820> pump<00:02:15.060> and<00:02:15.270> it's

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:15.480 
extremely high flowing pump and it's

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:17.960 
extremely high flowing pump and it's
also<00:02:15.780> incredibly<00:02:16.470> quiet<00:02:16.770> now<00:02:17.430> the<00:02:17.490> reason

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:17.970 
also incredibly quiet now the reason

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:20.240 
also incredibly quiet now the reason
this<00:02:18.120> is<00:02:18.330> quiet<00:02:18.720> and<00:02:19.050> flows<00:02:19.530> so<00:02:19.860> well<00:02:19.890> is

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:20.250 
this is quiet and flows so well is

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:21.680 
this is quiet and flows so well is
because<00:02:20.280> they<00:02:20.580> actually<00:02:20.760> use<00:02:21.000> a<00:02:21.030> turbine

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:21.690 
because they actually use a turbine

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:25.490 
because they actually use a turbine
impeller<00:02:22.200> to<00:02:22.800> pick<00:02:23.250> up<00:02:23.400> the<00:02:23.520> fuel<00:02:23.790> now<00:02:24.540> again

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:25.500 
impeller to pick up the fuel now again

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:27.350 
impeller to pick up the fuel now again
what<00:02:25.770> that<00:02:25.920> does<00:02:26.220> that<00:02:26.520> keeps<00:02:27.120> everything

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:27.360 
what that does that keeps everything

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:29.240 
what that does that keeps everything
nice<00:02:27.600> and<00:02:27.660> quiet<00:02:28.050> you<00:02:28.560> don't<00:02:28.710> want<00:02:28.890> a<00:02:29.010> very

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:29.250 
nice and quiet you don't want a very

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:30.770 
nice and quiet you don't want a very
loud<00:02:29.460> fuel<00:02:29.760> tank<00:02:30.000> buzzing<00:02:30.360> around<00:02:30.450> in<00:02:30.690> your

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:30.780 
loud fuel tank buzzing around in your

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:34.700 
loud fuel tank buzzing around in your
tank<00:02:31.130> and<00:02:32.130> that's<00:02:32.340> also<00:02:32.990> very<00:02:33.990> reliable<00:02:34.320> as

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:34.710 
tank and that's also very reliable as

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:36.740 
tank and that's also very reliable as
well<00:02:34.920> you<00:02:35.310> close<00:02:35.580> an<00:02:35.730> incredible<00:02:36.540> amount

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:36.750 
well you close an incredible amount

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:40.010 
well you close an incredible amount
you'll<00:02:37.310> 325<00:02:38.310> liters<00:02:38.790> per<00:02:38.970> hour<00:02:39.120> to<00:02:39.360> be<00:02:39.450> exact
