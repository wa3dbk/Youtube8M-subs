00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.920
 and here I say it is criminal for me and because 

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:06.870
 I say it is criminal because although it is 

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:09.120
 true the two players raise the 

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:11.670
 leg first the action of 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:14.250
 fun goalie maybe with your hand and 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:17.029
 here the slowest speed who plays 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:20.160
 the ball who plays it is primarily 

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:23.070
 rodríguez choose who plays the ball and 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:25.650
 in the end he is late he does not arrive late 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:28.109
 it's not there, look there , it's late, 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:29.609
 impacts because if there is no contact it is 

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:32.009
 dangerous game is well again the 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:33.899
 played but if there is contact it becomes 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:36.120
 in direct free kick in that sense 

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:38.270
 inside the penalty area I already want in 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:41.399
 this teacher action really better 

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:43.590
 reproach this attitude look at that the 

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:45.300
 phrase that says teacher forgot that 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:47.430
 we are professional football 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:49.530
 here link the assistant or the room 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:51.210
 official would have said if I have value and 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:53.250
 if I have the courage to speak the referee and 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:55.199
 to have him expel you but 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:56.879
 unfortunately I do not know if it was that 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:58.949
 outwardly they told him why he had 

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:00.899
 last five or six minutes when he says 

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:02.190
 the teacher was expelled better the 

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:03.989
 true that 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:05.729
 such situations to which no 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:08.040
 re-present for you criminal 

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:11.100
 for me it is criminal for the situation is what 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:12.659
 that I had come in the analysis by 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:15.119
 the way that if there are no contacts 

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:17.100
 companions even when with the camera 

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:18.720
 a little difficult but if there is contact 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:21.420
 it stops being dangerous game if there is no 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:23.640
 contact is the decision that the 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:25.920
 referee as indirect free kick because 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:28.649
 the two players go with the exception 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:30.630
 at the discretion of the Lord departures and I 

00:01:28.649 --> 00:01:32.850
 I refer rule 12 where are the 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:34.440
 faults and inaccuracies where it establishes 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:37.020
 that when a player can see the 

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:39.030
 rule 12 the first paragraph of the rule 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:40.470
 12 where they are even in the part of 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:41.550
 Below are the explanations to the 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:45.780
 interpretations that are given to the 

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:49.860
 rule says that when a player comes out 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:52.320
 with the intention of touching the ball and 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:54.750
 puts someone's integrity at risk 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:58.680
 naval or its integrity 

00:01:54.750 --> 00:02:01.560
 ss indirect free mark and bad and in that 

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:03.149
 saga in that move of noel valladares and 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:07.229
 of palomo rodríguez 

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:09.420
 the two players go with their foot 

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:16.590
 ie up to meet you going to 

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:19.230
 help because the ball was or is the 

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:24.860
 palomo rodríguez is a divided play 

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:28.140
 and direct 

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:30.600
 he even touches the photo with his hand 

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:32.190
 it's true the two players go with foot 

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:35.269
 raised look at the height of the two 

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:35.269
 the two players 

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:43.319
 now listen think well at that moment 

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:46.410
 who touches the ball is rodríguez and noel 

00:02:43.319 --> 00:02:48.690
 arrives late and hits the ankle of the 

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:50.459
 attacker of the espanya and excuse me that 

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:53.329
 I contradict you but at this moment 

00:02:50.459 --> 00:02:53.329
 me neither 

00:02:53.810 --> 00:03:04.740
 the apology that I have makes him talk 

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:06.540
 with combat and if you touch the ball and if not 

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:09.100
 touch the ball would be simple is 

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:11.020
 Rodriguez comes 

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:13.480
 okay it's fine that ultimately to 

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:16.570
 play loose work on it at last 

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:19.000
 instance the word luck look at not the 

00:03:16.570 --> 00:03:21.670
 touches but then after that 

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:23.980
 Rodriguez has impacted and in the end the 

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:28.120
 ankle on the plate the tackle itself 

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:31.570
 from the Olympia goalkeeper and 

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:35.740
 logically causes the player to be knocked down 

00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:37.630
 and the dangerous game name can not 

00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:40.320
 have contact or can not have contact 

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:40.320
 to make it game 

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:57.760
 there is no contact there is no ignorance of 

00:03:55.390 --> 00:03:59.200
 regulation because if there are contacts leaves 

00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:03.400
 of being dangerous games 

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:05.440
 games and rough play but gentleman will 

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:11.610
 misguided advised more because if 

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:11.610
 there are good and that is the difference 

00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:30.690
 but the rule night pause
