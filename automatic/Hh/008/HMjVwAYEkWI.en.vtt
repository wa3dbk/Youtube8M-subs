it'll<00:02:05.870> kind<00:02:06.080> of<00:02:06.260> cut<00:02:06.470> it<00:02:06.620> so<00:02:07.580> it's<00:02:08.180> like<00:02:08.600> I<00:02:08.630> said

00:02:08.859 --> 00:02:08.869 
it'll kind of cut it so it's like I said

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:11.770 
it'll kind of cut it so it's like I said
it's<00:02:09.050> it's<00:02:09.320> decent<00:02:09.890> just<00:02:10.190> not<00:02:10.390> not<00:02:11.390> the<00:02:11.570> best

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:11.780 
it's it's decent just not not the best

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:14.170 
it's it's decent just not not the best
so<00:02:12.620> what<00:02:12.860> you<00:02:12.980> do<00:02:13.100> first<00:02:13.130> is<00:02:13.640> you<00:02:13.700> have<00:02:14.030> to

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:14.180 
so what you do first is you have to

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:16.420 
so what you do first is you have to
align<00:02:14.450> this<00:02:15.410> edge<00:02:15.650> of<00:02:15.860> the<00:02:15.980> knife<00:02:16.160> up<00:02:16.400> here

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:16.430 
align this edge of the knife up here

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:18.520 
align this edge of the knife up here
with<00:02:17.300> this<00:02:17.450> bag<00:02:17.690> it<00:02:18.050> comes<00:02:18.200> with<00:02:18.440> the

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:18.530 
with this bag it comes with the

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:19.990 
with this bag it comes with the
instructions<00:02:19.070> I've<00:02:19.250> already<00:02:19.460> done<00:02:19.640> that<00:02:19.820> and

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:20.000 
instructions I've already done that and

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.750 
instructions I've already done that and
you<00:02:20.960> check<00:02:21.230> the<00:02:21.440> the<00:02:21.860> knife<00:02:22.040> angle<00:02:22.520> to<00:02:22.640> make

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:22.760 
you check the the knife angle to make

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:24.100 
you check the the knife angle to make
sure<00:02:22.940> it's<00:02:23.060> correct<00:02:23.240> like<00:02:23.780> I<00:02:23.810> said<00:02:24.020> I've

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:24.110 
sure it's correct like I said I've

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:26.830 
sure it's correct like I said I've
already<00:02:24.200> done<00:02:24.530> that<00:02:24.710> so<00:02:25.670> with<00:02:26.180> the<00:02:26.330> stone<00:02:26.600> you

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:26.840 
already done that so with the stone you

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:30.280 
already done that so with the stone you
just<00:02:27.050> start<00:02:27.290> to<00:02:28.000> start<00:02:29.000> working<00:02:29.300> out<00:02:29.390> the<00:02:29.660> edge

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:30.290 
just start to start working out the edge

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:33.000 
just start to start working out the edge
I'm<00:02:31.010> not<00:02:31.220> applying<00:02:31.490> any<00:02:31.820> pressure<00:02:31.970> right<00:02:32.780> now

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:33.010 
I'm not applying any pressure right now

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:36.040 
I'm not applying any pressure right now
I'm<00:02:34.010> just<00:02:34.280> letting<00:02:34.580> the<00:02:34.820> stone<00:02:35.390> and<00:02:35.720> a<00:02:35.780> grind

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:36.050 
I'm just letting the stone and a grind

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:37.930 
I'm just letting the stone and a grind
away<00:02:36.170> and<00:02:36.380> this<00:02:36.440> isn't<00:02:36.650> exactly<00:02:36.980> the<00:02:37.550> proper

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:37.940 
away and this isn't exactly the proper

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:40.810 
away and this isn't exactly the proper
way<00:02:38.060> to<00:02:38.090> do<00:02:38.390> it<00:02:38.570> to<00:02:39.440> get<00:02:39.590> the<00:02:39.740> best<00:02:40.250> edge<00:02:40.520> right

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:40.820 
way to do it to get the best edge right

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:44.010 
way to do it to get the best edge right
now<00:02:40.880> I'm<00:02:41.120> just<00:02:41.240> trying<00:02:41.450> to<00:02:42.280> wear<00:02:43.280> down<00:02:43.310> the

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:44.020 
now I'm just trying to wear down the

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:46.660 
now I'm just trying to wear down the
edge<00:02:45.020> of<00:02:45.230> the<00:02:45.350> knife<00:02:45.500> to<00:02:45.920> the<00:02:46.160> best<00:02:46.370> possible

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:46.670 
edge of the knife to the best possible

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:48.430 
edge of the knife to the best possible
position<00:02:47.150> before<00:02:47.870> I<00:02:47.900> actually<00:02:48.020> start

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:48.440 
position before I actually start

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:57.070 
position before I actually start
finishing<00:02:48.920> it<00:02:49.070> out<00:02:55.240> the<00:02:56.240> hardest<00:02:56.600> part<00:02:56.810> to

00:02:57.070 --> 00:02:57.080 
finishing it out the hardest part to

00:02:57.080 --> 00:03:00.310 
finishing it out the hardest part to
this<00:02:57.560> whole<00:02:57.740> process<00:02:57.980> is<00:02:58.990> figuring<00:02:59.990> out<00:03:00.080> what

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:00.320 
this whole process is figuring out what

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:04.570 
this whole process is figuring out what
the<00:03:00.440> angle<00:03:00.800> is<00:03:00.920> of<00:03:01.250> the<00:03:01.670> knife<00:03:01.850> blade<00:03:02.470> and<00:03:03.580> they

00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:04.580 
the angle is of the knife blade and they

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:06.880 
the angle is of the knife blade and they
have<00:03:04.760> Marc's<00:03:05.180> pre-made<00:03:05.720> in<00:03:06.020> the<00:03:06.290> metal<00:03:06.590> home

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:06.890 
have Marc's pre-made in the metal home

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:10.150 
have Marc's pre-made in the metal home
blue<00:03:07.459> yellow<00:03:07.940> red<00:03:08.450> notches<00:03:09.020> that<00:03:09.230> define<00:03:10.130> what

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:10.160 
blue yellow red notches that define what

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:14.140 
blue yellow red notches that define what
they<00:03:10.580> say<00:03:10.880> is<00:03:11.060> the<00:03:11.270> angle<00:03:11.660> but<00:03:12.790> like<00:03:13.790> most

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:14.150 
they say is the angle but like most

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:16.330 
they say is the angle but like most
people<00:03:14.630> I<00:03:14.750> doubt<00:03:15.290> you<00:03:15.560> know<00:03:15.739> what<00:03:15.980> the<00:03:16.130> angle

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:16.340 
people I doubt you know what the angle

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:18.520 
people I doubt you know what the angle
of<00:03:16.430> your<00:03:16.580> knife<00:03:16.730> is<00:03:16.940> especially<00:03:17.840> becomes<00:03:18.320> on<00:03:18.500> a

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:18.530 
of your knife is especially becomes on a

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:20.800 
of your knife is especially becomes on a
set<00:03:18.860> like<00:03:19.040> these<00:03:19.280> knives<00:03:19.630> they're<00:03:20.630> all

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:20.810 
set like these knives they're all

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:23.680 
set like these knives they're all
different<00:03:21.170> angles<00:03:21.760> the<00:03:22.760> most<00:03:22.970> most<00:03:23.330> kitchen

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:23.690 
different angles the most most kitchen

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:26.050 
different angles the most most kitchen
knives<00:03:23.840> they<00:03:24.019> say<00:03:24.230> are<00:03:24.380> about<00:03:24.680> a<00:03:24.709> 20<00:03:25.160> 20<00:03:25.820> degree

00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:26.060 
knives they say are about a 20 20 degree

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:27.820 
knives they say are about a 20 20 degree
angle<00:03:26.090> and<00:03:26.570> that's<00:03:27.110> kind<00:03:27.470> of<00:03:27.530> what<00:03:27.680> I've<00:03:27.800> got

00:03:27.820 --> 00:03:27.830 
angle and that's kind of what I've got

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:30.100 
angle and that's kind of what I've got
this<00:03:28.130> set<00:03:28.340> to<00:03:28.550> it's<00:03:29.030> close<00:03:29.239> to<00:03:29.269> that<00:03:29.570> 20<00:03:29.840> degree

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:30.110 
this set to it's close to that 20 degree

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:33.310 
this set to it's close to that 20 degree
mark<00:03:30.970> but<00:03:31.970> also<00:03:32.150> depends<00:03:32.690> on<00:03:32.810> where<00:03:32.959> you<00:03:33.110> set

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:33.320 
mark but also depends on where you set

00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:43.320 
mark but also depends on where you set
your<00:03:33.350> knife<00:03:33.620> on<00:03:33.830> here<00:03:34.040> now<00:03:34.220> pick<00:03:34.489> the<00:03:34.700> knife<00:03:34.850> is

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:43.330 

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:45.850 

so<00:03:44.330> in<00:03:44.630> it<00:03:44.780> you<00:03:44.900> may<00:03:45.020> have<00:03:45.140> noticed<00:03:45.500> I<00:03:45.650> didn't

00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:45.860 
so in it you may have noticed I didn't

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:50.410 
so in it you may have noticed I didn't
even<00:03:46.010> wet<00:03:46.250> this<00:03:46.490> stone<00:03:48.790> the<00:03:49.790> only<00:03:50.060> reason<00:03:50.330> why

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:50.420 
even wet this stone the only reason why

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:52.390 
even wet this stone the only reason why
it<00:03:50.480> wet<00:03:50.930> this<00:03:51.110> stone<00:03:51.320> actually<00:03:51.770> with<00:03:51.920> these<00:03:52.130> is

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:52.400 
it wet this stone actually with these is

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:55.840 
it wet this stone actually with these is
to<00:03:52.820> remove<00:03:53.330> the<00:03:53.660> metal<00:03:54.380> swarf<00:03:54.920> that<00:03:55.430> builds<00:03:55.700> up

00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:55.850 
to remove the metal swarf that builds up

00:03:55.850 --> 00:03:58.920 
to remove the metal swarf that builds up
that<00:03:56.270> prevents<00:03:56.750> it<00:03:56.840> from<00:03:57.100> grinding<00:03:58.100> properly

00:03:58.920 --> 00:03:58.930 
that prevents it from grinding properly

00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:02.830 
that prevents it from grinding properly
so<00:03:59.930> after<00:04:00.320> doing<00:04:00.860> one<00:04:01.040> knife<00:04:01.250> idea<00:04:01.760> remove<00:04:02.720> all

00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:02.840 
so after doing one knife idea remove all

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:07.810 
so after doing one knife idea remove all
of<00:04:02.960> the<00:04:03.020> metal<00:04:03.260> particles<00:04:03.530> on<00:04:03.950> it<00:04:06.820> actually

00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:07.820 
of the metal particles on it actually

00:04:07.820 --> 00:04:11.770 
of the metal particles on it actually
going<00:04:08.030> to<00:04:09.700> rub<00:04:10.700> it<00:04:10.730> down<00:04:10.880> with<00:04:11.240> a<00:04:11.270> wet<00:04:11.510> cloth

00:04:11.770 --> 00:04:11.780 
going to rub it down with a wet cloth

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:17.770 
going to rub it down with a wet cloth
right<00:04:12.080> now<00:04:13.540> and<00:04:15.160> when<00:04:16.160> when<00:04:16.700> the<00:04:16.880> stone<00:04:17.450> gets

00:04:17.770 --> 00:04:17.780 
right now and when when the stone gets

00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:21.070 
right now and when when the stone gets
embedded<00:04:18.350> with<00:04:18.739> metal<00:04:19.400> particles<00:04:19.910> I<00:04:20.120> put<00:04:21.049> a

00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:21.080 
embedded with metal particles I put a

00:04:21.080 --> 00:04:23.230 
embedded with metal particles I put a
very<00:04:21.830> fine<00:04:22.130> piece<00:04:22.340> of<00:04:22.520> sandpaper<00:04:22.820> on<00:04:23.090> the

00:04:23.230 --> 00:04:23.240 
very fine piece of sandpaper on the

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:25.810 
very fine piece of sandpaper on the

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:30.700 
across it on the flat on a flat surface
and<00:04:28.910> takes<00:04:29.600> all<00:04:29.750> the<00:04:29.870> metal<00:04:30.110> particles<00:04:30.560> off

00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:30.710 
and takes all the metal particles off

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:34.780 
and takes all the metal particles off
and<00:04:30.950> it's<00:04:31.070> it's<00:04:31.610> good<00:04:31.820> again<00:04:33.400> it's<00:04:34.400> just<00:04:34.490> hard

00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:38.840 
side down instead of right side up like

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:46.780 
side down instead of right side up like
most<00:04:39.170> stones<00:04:43.870> but<00:04:44.870> you<00:04:45.020> see<00:04:45.250> I'm<00:04:46.250> able<00:04:46.430> to<00:04:46.580> keep

00:04:46.790 --> 00:04:49.000 
most stones but you see I'm able to keep
the<00:04:46.910> knife<00:04:47.090> perfectly<00:04:47.600> still<00:04:47.930> and<00:04:48.380> I'm<00:04:48.890> able

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:49.010 
the knife perfectly still and I'm able

00:04:49.010 --> 00:04:54.630 
the knife perfectly still and I'm able
to<00:04:49.160> keep<00:04:49.370> the<00:04:49.520> angle<00:04:49.880> the<00:04:50.570> same<00:04:50.600> on<00:04:51.230> this<00:04:51.410> stone

00:04:54.630 --> 00:04:54.640 

00:04:54.640 --> 00:04:57.550 

which<00:04:55.640> for<00:04:56.270> someone<00:04:56.570> who<00:04:56.660> is<00:04:56.810> new<00:04:56.990> like<00:04:57.230> me<00:04:57.410> to

00:04:57.550 --> 00:04:57.560 
which for someone who is new like me to

00:04:57.560 --> 00:05:00.520 
which for someone who is new like me to
sharpening<00:04:58.040> that<00:04:58.100> that's<00:04:58.790> what<00:04:59.030> I<00:04:59.060> really<00:04:59.530> was

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:00.530 
sharpening that that's what I really was

00:05:00.530 --> 00:05:02.140 
sharpening that that's what I really was
not<00:05:00.710> able<00:05:00.920> to<00:05:01.010> do<00:05:01.220> with<00:05:01.430> the<00:05:01.550> standard<00:05:01.940> water

00:05:02.140 --> 00:05:02.150 
not able to do with the standard water

00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:05.550 
not able to do with the standard water
stone<00:05:02.680> so<00:05:03.680> I'm<00:05:03.830> going<00:05:04.010> to<00:05:04.070> pull<00:05:04.430> this<00:05:04.580> off<00:05:04.790> now

00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:05.560 
stone so I'm going to pull this off now

00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:08.620 
stone so I'm going to pull this off now
after<00:05:06.560> I<00:05:06.590> make<00:05:06.860> a<00:05:06.890> couple<00:05:07.160> more<00:05:07.400> passes<00:05:07.640> this

00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:08.630 
after I make a couple more passes this

00:05:08.630 --> 00:05:11.380 
after I make a couple more passes this
isn't<00:05:09.110> as<00:05:09.490> sharpen<00:05:10.490> as<00:05:10.670> I<00:05:10.820> was<00:05:11.000> making<00:05:11.300> the

00:05:11.380 --> 00:05:11.390 
isn't as sharpen as I was making the

00:05:11.390 --> 00:05:13.450 
isn't as sharpen as I was making the
other<00:05:11.510> knives<00:05:11.780> but<00:05:12.050> this<00:05:12.260> is<00:05:12.410> just<00:05:12.590> to<00:05:13.220> try<00:05:13.400> to

00:05:13.450 --> 00:05:13.460 
other knives but this is just to try to

00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:17.980 
other knives but this is just to try to
demonstrate<00:05:14.020> just<00:05:15.020> with<00:05:15.200> a<00:05:15.230> few<00:05:15.500> passes<00:05:16.990> what

00:05:17.980 --> 00:05:17.990 
demonstrate just with a few passes what

00:05:17.990 --> 00:05:19.840 
demonstrate just with a few passes what
this<00:05:18.170> thing<00:05:18.380> can<00:05:18.530> do<00:05:18.710> and<00:05:19.070> I<00:05:19.310> don't<00:05:19.580> have<00:05:19.700> the

00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:19.850 
this thing can do and I don't have the

00:05:19.850 --> 00:05:23.040 
this thing can do and I don't have the
full<00:05:20.030> technique<00:05:20.450> I<00:05:20.570> just<00:05:20.810> got<00:05:20.960> it<00:05:21.080> today<00:05:21.280> so

00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:23.050 
full technique I just got it today so

00:05:23.050 --> 00:05:25.690 
full technique I just got it today so
there's<00:05:24.050> still<00:05:24.710> a<00:05:24.770> lot<00:05:24.800> of<00:05:25.010> practice<00:05:25.400> I<00:05:25.550> need

00:05:25.690 --> 00:05:25.700 
there's still a lot of practice I need

00:05:25.700 --> 00:05:27.400 
there's still a lot of practice I need
to<00:05:25.820> do<00:05:25.940> and<00:05:26.180> figuring<00:05:26.600> out<00:05:26.690> what's<00:05:26.900> the<00:05:26.960> best<00:05:27.020> I

00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:27.410 
to do and figuring out what's the best I

00:05:27.410 --> 00:05:31.300 
to do and figuring out what's the best I
also<00:05:27.740> ordered<00:05:28.070> um<00:05:28.370> some<00:05:29.320> to<00:05:30.320> two<00:05:30.770> thousand<00:05:31.250> and

00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:31.310 
also ordered um some to two thousand and

00:05:31.310 --> 00:05:34.090 
also ordered um some to two thousand and
three<00:05:31.490> thousand<00:05:31.910> grit<00:05:32.060> stones<00:05:32.450> and<00:05:32.890> the<00:05:33.890> only

00:05:34.090 --> 00:05:34.100 
three thousand grit stones and the only

00:05:34.100 --> 00:05:35.800 
three thousand grit stones and the only
place<00:05:34.310> is<00:05:34.490> able<00:05:34.730> to<00:05:34.790> find<00:05:35.030> them<00:05:35.180> was<00:05:35.360> in<00:05:35.510> China

00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:35.810 
place is able to find them was in China

00:05:35.810 --> 00:05:37.990 
place is able to find them was in China
so<00:05:36.200> it'll<00:05:36.920> take<00:05:37.010> them<00:05:37.130> a<00:05:37.250> couple<00:05:37.520> weeks<00:05:37.730> to<00:05:37.880> get

00:05:37.990 --> 00:05:38.000 
so it'll take them a couple weeks to get

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:40.950 
so it'll take them a couple weeks to get
here

00:05:40.950 --> 00:05:40.960 

00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:44.219 

so<00:05:41.440> let's<00:05:41.770> see<00:05:41.949> what<00:05:42.370> that<00:05:42.610> has<00:05:42.669> done<00:05:42.940> just<00:05:43.479> the

00:05:44.219 --> 00:05:44.229 
so let's see what that has done just the

00:05:44.229 --> 00:05:48.770 
so let's see what that has done just the
basic<00:05:44.710> I<00:05:44.919> mean<00:05:45.009> I<00:05:45.220> haven't<00:05:45.370> even<00:05:46.530> haven't<00:05:47.530> even

00:05:48.770 --> 00:05:48.780 
basic I mean I haven't even haven't even

00:05:48.780 --> 00:05:56.999 
basic I mean I haven't even haven't even
really<00:05:49.780> done<00:05:49.960> it<00:05:50.110> as<00:05:50.320> I<00:05:50.590> as<00:05:50.979> I<00:05:51.039> should<00:05:55.889> you<00:05:56.889> can

00:05:56.999 --> 00:05:57.009 
really done it as I as I should you can

00:05:57.009 --> 00:06:03.590 
really done it as I as I should you can
see<00:05:57.190> even<00:05:57.460> even<00:05:58.060> with<00:05:58.180> the<00:05:58.270> beginning<00:05:58.539> passes

00:06:03.590 --> 00:06:03.600 

00:06:03.600 --> 00:06:19.350 

someone<00:06:17.099> that<00:06:18.099> is<00:06:18.280> it<00:06:18.610> is<00:06:18.759> sharper<00:06:19.120> than<00:06:19.150> it

00:06:19.350 --> 00:06:19.360 
someone that is it is sharper than it

00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:24.540 
someone that is it is sharper than it
was<00:06:22.199> still<00:06:23.199> not<00:06:23.380> super<00:06:24.039> sharp

00:06:24.540 --> 00:06:24.550 
was still not super sharp

00:06:24.550 --> 00:06:27.960 
was still not super sharp
secta<00:06:25.710> for<00:06:26.710> just<00:06:26.919> a<00:06:27.009> couple<00:06:27.310> of<00:06:27.370> passes<00:06:27.789> with

00:06:27.960 --> 00:06:27.970 
secta for just a couple of passes with

00:06:27.970 --> 00:06:29.430 
secta for just a couple of passes with
this<00:06:28.150> thing<00:06:28.389> if<00:06:28.570> it<00:06:28.720> is<00:06:28.900> definitely

00:06:29.430 --> 00:06:29.440 
this thing if it is definitely

00:06:29.440 --> 00:06:32.159 
this thing if it is definitely
impressive<00:06:30.250> blade<00:06:30.550> and<00:06:30.880> I<00:06:31.360> do<00:06:31.419> it<00:06:31.690> even<00:06:31.990> more

00:06:32.159 --> 00:06:32.169 
impressive blade and I do it even more

00:06:32.169 --> 00:06:37.279 
impressive blade and I do it even more
with<00:06:32.650> them<00:06:34.919> with<00:06:35.919> the<00:06:36.370> knife<00:06:36.550> once<00:06:36.880> I'm

00:06:37.279 --> 00:06:37.289 
with them with the knife once I'm

00:06:37.289 --> 00:06:39.450 
with them with the knife once I'm
completely<00:06:38.289> done<00:06:38.500> with<00:06:38.680> it<00:06:38.830> then<00:06:39.130> hopefully

00:06:39.450 --> 00:06:39.460 
completely done with it then hopefully

00:06:39.460 --> 00:06:41.370 
completely done with it then hopefully
once<00:06:39.610> they<00:06:39.729> get<00:06:39.820> the<00:06:39.970> two<00:06:40.120> thousand<00:06:40.599> and<00:06:40.780> three

00:06:41.370 --> 00:06:41.380 
once they get the two thousand and three

00:06:41.380 --> 00:06:43.320 
once they get the two thousand and three
thousand<00:06:41.830> grit<00:06:42.009> I'll<00:06:42.550> be<00:06:42.729> able<00:06:42.910> to<00:06:43.000> make<00:06:43.120> it

00:06:43.320 --> 00:06:43.330 
thousand grit I'll be able to make it

00:06:43.330 --> 00:06:46.409 
thousand grit I'll be able to make it
razor<00:06:43.810> razor<00:06:44.139> sharp<00:06:44.669> but<00:06:45.669> once<00:06:46.030> you<00:06:46.120> find<00:06:46.330> the

00:06:46.409 --> 00:06:46.419 
razor razor sharp but once you find the

00:06:46.419 --> 00:06:48.719 
razor razor sharp but once you find the
angle<00:06:46.720> that<00:06:46.870> pretty<00:06:47.409> much<00:06:47.560> pretty<00:06:48.430> much<00:06:48.550> is

00:06:48.719 --> 00:06:48.729 
angle that pretty much pretty much is

00:06:48.729 --> 00:06:49.950 
angle that pretty much pretty much is
all<00:06:48.849> you<00:06:48.909> have<00:06:49.030> to<00:06:49.120> do<00:06:49.270> and<00:06:49.449> especially<00:06:49.539> if<00:06:49.900> you

00:06:49.950 --> 00:06:49.960 
all you have to do and especially if you

00:06:49.960 --> 00:06:51.360 
all you have to do and especially if you
have<00:06:50.020> set<00:06:50.320> some<00:06:50.500> knives<00:06:50.710> where<00:06:50.949> you<00:06:51.039> have<00:06:51.190> like

00:06:51.360 --> 00:06:51.370 
have set some knives where you have like

00:06:51.370 --> 00:06:54.659 
have set some knives where you have like
five<00:06:51.699> or<00:06:51.970> six<00:06:52.000> or<00:06:52.479> so<00:06:53.470> the<00:06:53.830> same<00:06:54.070> knife<00:06:54.340> you<00:06:54.580> can
