outdoor<00:03:48.860> pictures<00:03:49.160> not<00:03:49.430> really<00:03:49.670> indoor<00:03:50.000> but

00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:50.840 
outdoor pictures not really indoor but

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:52.150 
outdoor pictures not really indoor but
you<00:03:50.930> see<00:03:51.080> it<00:03:51.170> took<00:03:51.290> a<00:03:51.380> darker<00:03:51.650> pitch<00:03:51.830> and<00:03:51.980> a<00:03:52.010> lot

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:52.160 
you see it took a darker pitch and a lot

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:53.170 
you see it took a darker pitch and a lot
of<00:03:52.190> picture<00:03:52.549> and<00:03:52.670> it's<00:03:52.850> going<00:03:52.970> to<00:03:53.030> combine

00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:53.180 
of picture and it's going to combine

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:55.530 
of picture and it's going to combine
them<00:03:53.480> together<00:03:53.600> to<00:03:53.870> make<00:03:53.989> one<00:03:54.410> picture<00:03:54.860> itself

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:55.540 
them together to make one picture itself

00:03:55.540 --> 00:03:59.140 
them together to make one picture itself
and<00:03:57.010> so<00:03:58.010> that's<00:03:58.190> the<00:03:58.280> picture<00:03:58.459> right<00:03:58.700> there<00:03:58.730> so

00:03:59.140 --> 00:03:59.150 
and so that's the picture right there so

00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:01.240 
and so that's the picture right there so
it<00:03:59.269> doesn't<00:03:59.570> really<00:03:59.630> look<00:03:59.959> I<00:04:00.200> mean<00:04:00.500> this<00:04:01.100> is

00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:01.250 
it doesn't really look I mean this is

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:02.860 
it doesn't really look I mean this is
not<00:04:01.370> a<00:04:01.430> really<00:04:01.670> good<00:04:01.790> representation<00:04:02.480> I<00:04:02.750> want

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:02.870 
not a really good representation I want

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:04.990 
not a really good representation I want
to<00:04:02.930> put<00:04:03.019> a<00:04:03.049> picture<00:04:03.260> up<00:04:03.440> here<00:04:03.560> for<00:04:03.830> you<00:04:03.950> for<00:04:04.880> you
