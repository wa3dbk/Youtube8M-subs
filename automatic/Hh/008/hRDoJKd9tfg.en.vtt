personal trainer I'm real excited to
bring<00:00:06.299> this<00:00:06.509> technique<00:00:06.930> to<00:00:07.140> you

00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:07.440 
bring this technique to you

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:09.080 
bring this technique to you
I'm<00:00:07.770> going<00:00:07.980> to<00:00:08.040> show<00:00:08.220> you<00:00:08.280> the<00:00:08.460> technique<00:00:08.880> on

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:09.090 
I'm going to show you the technique on

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:10.669 
I'm going to show you the technique on
the<00:00:09.240> flat<00:00:09.450> bench<00:00:09.690> press<00:00:09.809> but<00:00:10.019> you<00:00:10.290> can<00:00:10.440> do<00:00:10.559> it

00:00:10.669 --> 00:00:10.679 
the flat bench press but you can do it

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:12.589 
the flat bench press but you can do it
with<00:00:10.920> any<00:00:11.099> exercise<00:00:11.340> that<00:00:11.730> you<00:00:11.820> do<00:00:11.969> it's

00:00:12.589 --> 00:00:12.599 
with any exercise that you do it's

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:14.120 
with any exercise that you do it's
called<00:00:12.809> a<00:00:12.900> drop<00:00:13.110> set<00:00:13.410> but<00:00:13.620> if<00:00:13.740> you<00:00:13.830> have<00:00:13.950> heard

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:14.130 
called a drop set but if you have heard

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:15.829 
called a drop set but if you have heard
of<00:00:14.219> it<00:00:14.370> but<00:00:15.210> I<00:00:15.240> can<00:00:15.269> tell<00:00:15.509> you<00:00:15.630> what<00:00:15.750> I<00:00:15.780> just

00:00:15.829 --> 00:00:15.839 
of it but I can tell you what I just

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:17.480 
of it but I can tell you what I just
started<00:00:16.320> practicing<00:00:16.529> and<00:00:17.220> I've<00:00:17.279> seen

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:17.490 
started practicing and I've seen

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:19.490 
started practicing and I've seen
excellent<00:00:18.330> results<00:00:18.840> from<00:00:18.930> it<00:00:19.109> and<00:00:19.230> I<00:00:19.260> think

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:19.500 
excellent results from it and I think

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:21.410 
excellent results from it and I think
people<00:00:19.619> too<00:00:19.949> now<00:00:20.520> the<00:00:20.580> premise<00:00:20.850> behind<00:00:21.000> it

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:21.420 
people too now the premise behind it

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:24.769 
people too now the premise behind it
behind<00:00:21.600> a<00:00:21.810> drop<00:00:22.080> set<00:00:22.410> is<00:00:23.189> that<00:00:23.640> you<00:00:24.359> do<00:00:24.510> a<00:00:24.539> way

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:24.779 
behind a drop set is that you do a way

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:25.670 
behind a drop set is that you do a way
to<00:00:24.840> failure

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:25.680 
to failure

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:28.189 
to failure
nice<00:00:25.980> and<00:00:26.279> slow<00:00:26.490> you<00:00:26.730> rack<00:00:27.060> it<00:00:27.090> maybe<00:00:27.900> lighten

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:28.199 
nice and slow you rack it maybe lighten

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:30.019 
nice and slow you rack it maybe lighten
up<00:00:28.320> the<00:00:28.439> weight<00:00:28.560> a<00:00:28.590> little<00:00:28.949> bit<00:00:29.099> and<00:00:29.340> then<00:00:29.910> you

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:30.029 
up the weight a little bit and then you

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:31.999 
up the weight a little bit and then you
do<00:00:30.179> a<00:00:30.210> set<00:00:30.480> about<00:00:30.630> 30<00:00:30.929> to<00:00:31.080> 45<00:00:31.349> seconds<00:00:31.830> right

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:32.009 
do a set about 30 to 45 seconds right

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:34.010 
do a set about 30 to 45 seconds right
after<00:00:32.340> that<00:00:32.520> I<00:00:32.700> want<00:00:33.149> to<00:00:33.210> do<00:00:33.360> that<00:00:33.690> technique

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:34.020 
after that I want to do that technique

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:37.970 
after that I want to do that technique
on<00:00:34.590> the<00:00:35.520> last<00:00:35.760> set<00:00:36.149> of<00:00:36.180> the<00:00:36.960> exercise<00:00:37.440> maybe<00:00:37.770> do

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:37.980 
on the last set of the exercise maybe do

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:39.619 
on the last set of the exercise maybe do
it<00:00:38.070> on<00:00:38.250> two<00:00:38.640> or<00:00:38.790> three<00:00:38.969> exercises<00:00:39.480> in<00:00:39.540> the

00:00:39.619 --> 00:00:39.629 
it on two or three exercises in the

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:41.540 
it on two or three exercises in the
routine<00:00:39.899> otherwise<00:00:40.200> it's<00:00:40.410> too<00:00:40.469> much<00:00:40.800> the

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550 
routine otherwise it's too much the

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:43.250 
routine otherwise it's too much the
premise<00:00:41.969> is<00:00:42.180> that<00:00:42.210> you're<00:00:42.750> going<00:00:42.870> to<00:00:42.930> get<00:00:43.050> more

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
premise is that you're going to get more

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:45.740 
premise is that you're going to get more
blood<00:00:43.590> flow<00:00:43.920> into<00:00:44.250> the<00:00:44.430> muscle<00:00:44.910> and<00:00:45.450> it's<00:00:45.600> not

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750 
blood flow into the muscle and it's not

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:48.580 
blood flow into the muscle and it's not
you're<00:00:45.930> going<00:00:46.050> to<00:00:46.110> feel<00:00:46.289> a<00:00:46.320> pump<00:00:46.680> and<00:00:47.480> the

00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:48.590 
you're going to feel a pump and the

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:50.569 
you're going to feel a pump and the
philosophy<00:00:49.590> is<00:00:49.680> that<00:00:49.890> that<00:00:50.039> more<00:00:50.309> blood

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:50.579 
philosophy is that that more blood

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:53.090 
philosophy is that that more blood
inside<00:00:51.120> the<00:00:51.329> muscle<00:00:51.750> during<00:00:52.350> that<00:00:52.469> drop<00:00:52.770> set

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
inside the muscle during that drop set

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:55.010 
inside the muscle during that drop set
is<00:00:53.250> going<00:00:53.489> to<00:00:53.640> see<00:00:53.910> if<00:00:54.059> you<00:00:54.180> can<00:00:54.329> feel<00:00:54.570> the<00:00:54.780> pump

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020 
is going to see if you can feel the pump

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:56.869 
is going to see if you can feel the pump
that's<00:00:55.199> for<00:00:55.440> sure<00:00:55.680> it's<00:00:56.250> going<00:00:56.489> to<00:00:56.550> stretch

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 
that's for sure it's going to stretch

00:00:56.879 --> 00:00:58.760 
that's for sure it's going to stretch
the<00:00:57.120> fashion<00:00:57.629> or<00:00:57.780> the<00:00:57.809> thin<00:00:58.230> sheets<00:00:58.530> of<00:00:58.680> the

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770 
the fashion or the thin sheets of the

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:00.590 
the fashion or the thin sheets of the
covering<00:00:59.129> that<00:00:59.219> covers<00:00:59.489> up<00:00:59.579> the<00:00:59.609> muscle<00:01:00.059> and

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
covering that covers up the muscle and

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:02.180 
covering that covers up the muscle and
it<00:01:00.690> gets<00:01:00.840> used<00:01:01.109> to<00:01:01.289> that<00:01:01.410> stretch<00:01:01.800> you<00:01:01.829> just

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190 
it gets used to that stretch you just

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:05.899 
it gets used to that stretch you just
for<00:01:02.399> them<00:01:02.780> 3045<00:01:03.780> minutes<00:01:04.049> during<00:01:04.799> that<00:01:05.100> post

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909 
for them 3045 minutes during that post

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:07.910 
for them 3045 minutes during that post
workout<00:01:06.390> of<00:01:06.750> pump<00:01:07.110> feeling<00:01:07.439> from<00:01:07.590> the<00:01:07.680> drop

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
workout of pump feeling from the drop

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:10.880 
workout of pump feeling from the drop
set<00:01:08.220> and<00:01:08.600> therefore<00:01:09.600> it<00:01:09.930> gets<00:01:10.080> used<00:01:10.500> to

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
set and therefore it gets used to

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:13.760 
set and therefore it gets used to
stretching<00:01:11.880> so<00:01:12.450> in<00:01:12.600> the<00:01:12.689> future<00:01:13.170> as<00:01:13.409> you<00:01:13.439> work

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
stretching so in the future as you work

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:16.700 
stretching so in the future as you work
out<00:01:13.979> that<00:01:14.580> masher<00:01:15.090> recovery<00:01:15.509> is<00:01:15.750> softer<00:01:16.619> and

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
out that masher recovery is softer and

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:19.190 
out that masher recovery is softer and
more<00:01:16.890> pliable<00:01:17.189> and<00:01:17.580> will<00:01:18.000> allow<00:01:18.659> the<00:01:18.720> muscle

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
more pliable and will allow the muscle

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.200 
more pliable and will allow the muscle
inside<00:01:19.530> to<00:01:19.740> grow<00:01:20.040> so<00:01:20.670> there's<00:01:20.909> a<00:01:20.970> lot<00:01:21.119> of

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
inside to grow so there's a lot of

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:23.330 
inside to grow so there's a lot of
people<00:01:21.330> who<00:01:21.509> think<00:01:21.810> that<00:01:21.869> the<00:01:22.650> fash<00:01:22.950> or<00:01:23.250> the

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
people who think that the fash or the

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:24.350 
people who think that the fash or the
cover<00:01:23.520> and<00:01:23.640> the<00:01:23.700> muscle<00:01:24.000> is<00:01:24.060> really<00:01:24.270> the

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
cover and the muscle is really the

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:27.710 
cover and the muscle is really the
limiting<00:01:24.750> factor<00:01:25.290> in<00:01:26.130> new<00:01:26.880> and<00:01:27.180> more<00:01:27.420> growth

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720 
limiting factor in new and more growth

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:29.480 
limiting factor in new and more growth
into<00:01:27.930> the<00:01:27.960> future<00:01:28.049> and<00:01:28.380> I<00:01:28.439> would<00:01:28.590> agree<00:01:28.799> and

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
into the future and I would agree and

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:31.100 
into the future and I would agree and
then<00:01:29.670> on<00:01:29.909> assignment<00:01:30.450> we'll<00:01:30.540> talk<00:01:30.720> about<00:01:30.900> legs

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110 
then on assignment we'll talk about legs

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:33.560 
then on assignment we'll talk about legs
but<00:01:31.259> also<00:01:31.439> the<00:01:31.710> nerves<00:01:32.070> your<00:01:32.729> nerves<00:01:33.060> limit

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570 
but also the nerves your nerves limit

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:34.850 
but also the nerves your nerves limit
your<00:01:33.720> muscle<00:01:34.020> growth<00:01:34.140> as<00:01:34.320> well<00:01:34.470> I'll<00:01:34.650> talk

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860 
your muscle growth as well I'll talk

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:36.859 
your muscle growth as well I'll talk
about<00:01:34.890> a<00:01:35.100> supplement<00:01:35.579> technique<00:01:36.030> and<00:01:36.600> if<00:01:36.689> you

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:36.869 
about a supplement technique and if you

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:13.700 
the chest muscles up focus on better

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:15.880 
the chest muscles up focus on better
during<00:02:14.390> any<00:02:14.510> chest<00:02:14.810> movement<00:02:15.170> and<00:02:15.290> that<00:02:15.830> is

during any chest movement and that is

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:18.880 
during any chest movement and that is
arched<00:02:17.110> when<00:02:18.110> you<00:02:18.170> get<00:02:18.290> down<00:02:18.410> in<00:02:18.560> the<00:02:18.620> pressed

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:18.890 
arched when you get down in the pressed

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:21.870 
arched when you get down in the pressed
position<00:02:19.420> you<00:02:20.420> guys<00:02:20.600> bring<00:02:20.870> your<00:02:20.900> feet<00:02:21.200> back

position you guys bring your feet back
arch<00:02:22.880> at<00:02:23.120> lower<00:02:23.360> back<00:02:23.570> up<00:02:23.780> with<00:02:23.959> that<00:02:23.989> chest

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:24.380 
arch at lower back up with that chest

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:26.050 
arch at lower back up with that chest
open<00:02:24.560> so<00:02:24.890> there's<00:02:25.070> a<00:02:25.130> space<00:02:25.370> here<00:02:25.640> this<00:02:25.820> is<00:02:25.940> a

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:26.060 
open so there's a space here this is a

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:29.830 
open so there's a space here this is a
classic<00:02:26.810> power<00:02:27.050> lifter<00:02:27.560> a<00:02:27.980> body<00:02:28.760> position<00:02:29.390> it

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:29.840 
classic power lifter a body position it

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:30.820 
classic power lifter a body position it
aligns<00:02:30.140> the<00:02:30.320> chest

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:30.830 
aligns the chest

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:32.560 
aligns the chest
hence<00:02:31.010> the<00:02:31.160> shoulders<00:02:31.610> down<00:02:31.820> so<00:02:32.239> that<00:02:32.330> you<00:02:32.420> can

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:32.570 
hence the shoulders down so that you can

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:35.280 
hence the shoulders down so that you can
feel<00:02:32.720> the<00:02:32.870> focus<00:02:33.170> on<00:02:33.290> the<00:02:33.380> chest<00:02:33.560> warm<00:02:34.209> and

lifter<00:03:37.890> is<00:03:37.950> lifting<00:03:38.250> more<00:03:38.370> weight<00:03:38.640> but

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:39.300 
lifter is lifting more weight but

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:40.910 
lifter is lifting more weight but
stressing<00:03:39.870> their<00:03:39.990> joints<00:03:40.410> and<00:03:40.530> not<00:03:40.620> putting

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:42.270 
the books where they really wanted to

00:03:42.270 --> 00:03:44.840 
the books where they really wanted to
make<00:03:42.390> the<00:03:42.510> chest<00:03:42.780> muscles<00:03:43.110> grow<00:03:43.290> so<00:03:44.160> maybe<00:03:44.760> a

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:44.850 
make the chest muscles grow so maybe a

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:48.260 
make the chest muscles grow so maybe a
technique<00:03:45.300> in<00:03:45.480> between<00:03:45.930> your<00:03:46.440> drop<00:03:46.740> set<00:03:47.060> is<00:03:48.060> to

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:48.270 
technique in between your drop set is to

00:03:48.270 --> 00:03:49.430 
technique in between your drop set is to
stretch<00:03:48.570> out<00:03:48.780> the<00:03:48.900> muscle<00:03:49.230> that<00:03:49.260> you're

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:49.440 
stretch out the muscle that you're

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:51.200 
stretch out the muscle that you're
focusing<00:03:49.800> on<00:03:49.950> so<00:03:50.310> this<00:03:50.670> would<00:03:50.850> be<00:03:51.000> a<00:03:51.030> nice

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:51.210 
focusing on so this would be a nice

00:03:51.210 --> 00:03:53.570 
focusing on so this would be a nice
chest<00:03:51.540> stretch<00:03:51.840> then<00:03:52.770> those<00:03:52.950> elbows<00:03:53.160> go

00:03:53.570 --> 00:03:53.580 
chest stretch then those elbows go
