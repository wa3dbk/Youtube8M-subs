00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:05.070
 Ema Tabata was fully enjoyed 

00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:08.079
 Stern 

00:00:08.079 --> 00:00:11.139
 Though it is having watched Oshikakubo blog 

00:00:11.139 --> 00:00:12.389
 About him 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:15.839
 I understand it well, but I use the same policy theme 

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:18.279
 Was it a question 

00:00:18.279 --> 00:00:21.279
 Today is about the work of the production 

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:25.609
 I would like to talk 

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:29.289
 I've heard about what I'm doing for 5 days 

00:00:29.899 --> 00:00:31.960
 If he were 

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:34.920
 I told you that it was a pipe role 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:37.210
 In other words 

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:39.750
 Animation is 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:43.050
 Start the layout 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:45.310
 Please and background picture 

00:00:45.310 --> 00:00:48.440
 It is the first attempt for these to be together 

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:50.240
 Can make 

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:53.290
 This is one cut voice but 

00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:54.260
 This too 

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:56.620
 Are you doing so 

00:00:56.620 --> 00:00:57.930
 Policy 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:00.090
 What is Matsumoto 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:02.440
 Erythrocytes 

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:03.930
 From Linda 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:05.360
 Red thing 

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:08.900
 Passed to the same building and / or the video canceled 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:12.580
 Some people are working outside the studio 

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:15.580
 I wanted to go outside and collect it outside 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:17.640
 When you know it 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:19.460
 Then the background picture 

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:20.970
 This is also in charge 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:23.970
 It is also possible to return one by one 

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:27.770
 Completely completed 

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:30.940
 Organize this from the perspective 

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:34.380
 I think it is the main task of policy 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:36.829
 Of course it has a schedule management function 

00:01:36.829 --> 00:01:39.190
 It will be an important job 

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:40.260
 others 

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:42.530
 Communicate with the anime went 

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:44.470
 Valley school 

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:47.300
 Do you want me to work properly? 

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:50.300
 It is in Takatsuki while saying that it is Comiket 

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:54.920
 We cook out to those who say that there are a lot of hits 

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:57.100
 May be taken away 

00:01:57.100 --> 00:01:58.480
 Well this is a horse 

00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:01.140
 Do something like Chiba City 

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:04.680
 I will create an atmosphere while enhancing my real knowledge 

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:07.999
 I think that it is work of production to go 

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:12.040
 In addition to this, a group of policies has a sound in 

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:14.699
 There are staff doing music 

00:02:14.699 --> 00:02:16.689
 It's Macko argument 

00:02:16.689 --> 00:02:18.439
 In other words, not writing work 

00:02:18.439 --> 00:02:20.529
 Before doing all things 

00:02:20.529 --> 00:02:23.929
 I think that is not something of the production 

00:02:23.929 --> 00:02:26.089
 That's it 

00:02:26.089 --> 00:02:29.339
 The animation is too late for the schedule 

00:02:29.339 --> 00:02:32.339
 I will go towards completion while taking back 

00:02:33.609 --> 00:02:36.309
 I talked about the work of the production
