control over here all it does is control
your<00:02:03.590> power<00:02:04.660> you<00:02:05.660> can<00:02:05.780> go<00:02:05.950> 1<00:02:06.950> hour<00:02:07.160> or<00:02:07.370> less<00:02:09.670> you

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:10.670 
your power you can go 1 hour or less you

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:14.410 
your power you can go 1 hour or less you
can<00:02:10.910> change<00:02:11.209> your<00:02:11.510> camera<00:02:11.959> view<00:02:13.180> over<00:02:14.180> here

can change your camera view over here

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:16.900 
can change your camera view over here
and<00:02:15.170> now<00:02:15.320> you're<00:02:15.530> like<00:02:15.830> like<00:02:16.490> you're<00:02:16.520> sitting

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:16.910 
and now you're like like you're sitting

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:18.670 
and now you're like like you're sitting
on<00:02:17.030> the<00:02:17.090> other<00:02:17.209> side<00:02:17.360> of<00:02:17.540> the<00:02:17.600> room<00:02:17.810> you<00:02:18.590> know

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:18.680 
on the other side of the room you know

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:21.729 
on the other side of the room you know
this<00:02:18.860> is<00:02:19.010> stationary<00:02:19.550> place<00:02:20.350> and<00:02:21.350> then<00:02:21.620> you

00:02:21.729 --> 00:02:21.739 
this is stationary place and then you

00:02:21.739 --> 00:02:23.290 
this is stationary place and then you
can<00:02:21.950> change<00:02:22.190> what<00:02:22.340> so<00:02:22.489> you're<00:02:22.670> like<00:02:22.850> actually

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:23.300 
can change what so you're like actually

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:26.620 
can change what so you're like actually
you<00:02:23.420> know<00:02:23.540> it<00:02:23.720> out<00:02:23.870> there<00:02:25.270> be<00:02:26.270> a<00:02:26.300> little<00:02:26.540> better

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:26.630 
you know it out there be a little better

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:30.690 
you know it out there be a little better
so<00:02:26.900> I<00:02:26.959> can<00:02:27.020> see<00:02:27.320> what's<00:02:27.470> going<00:02:27.530> on<00:02:28.420> so<00:02:29.420> if<00:02:29.900> you

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:30.700 
so I can see what's going on so if you

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:32.320 
so I can see what's going on so if you
tilt<00:02:31.700> it<00:02:31.880> forward

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:32.330 
tilt it forward

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:36.400 
tilt it forward
you'll<00:02:32.510> go<00:02:32.690> forward<00:02:34.630> you<00:02:35.630> can<00:02:35.840> turn<00:02:35.989> side<00:02:36.260> to

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:36.410 
you'll go forward you can turn side to

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:38.790 
you'll go forward you can turn side to
side

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:38.800 

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:44.680 

picking<00:02:39.800> the<00:02:39.920> power<00:02:40.810> the<00:02:41.810> power<00:02:41.990> to<00:02:43.420> go<00:02:44.420> up<00:02:44.510> and

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:44.690 
picking the power the power to go up and

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:46.930 
picking the power the power to go up and
down<00:02:44.810> to<00:02:45.140> so<00:02:45.830> this<00:02:45.980> tilt<00:02:46.370> it<00:02:46.490> forward<00:02:46.520> it<00:02:46.910> goes

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:46.940 
down to so this tilt it forward it goes

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:49.270 
down to so this tilt it forward it goes
forward<00:02:47.510> or<00:02:47.990> backwards<00:02:48.500> it<00:02:48.590> comes<00:02:48.770> backwards

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:49.280 
forward or backwards it comes backwards

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:52.530 
forward or backwards it comes backwards
and<00:02:49.490> then<00:02:50.390> your<00:02:50.600> car<00:02:50.810> gets<00:02:51.080> you<00:02:51.230> up<00:02:51.320> and<00:02:51.440> down

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:52.540 
and then your car gets you up and down

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:54.550 
and then your car gets you up and down
so<00:02:53.540> you<00:02:53.630> can<00:02:53.720> see<00:02:53.840> there's<00:02:54.020> all<00:02:54.110> kinds<00:02:54.350> of<00:02:54.410> cool

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:54.560 
so you can see there's all kinds of cool

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:56.320 
so you can see there's all kinds of cool
stuff<00:02:54.590> you<00:02:54.950> can<00:02:55.100> go<00:02:55.250> over<00:02:55.610> here<00:02:55.640> under<00:02:56.240> the
