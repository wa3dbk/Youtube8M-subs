midfielder<00:00:27.029> about<00:00:27.180> here<00:00:27.570> he<00:00:28.199> don't<00:00:28.380> tend<00:00:28.590> to

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:28.619 
midfielder about here he don't tend to

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:30.740 
midfielder about here he don't tend to
play<00:00:28.769> that<00:00:28.920> well<00:00:29.070> so<00:00:29.699> i<00:00:29.730> recommend<00:00:30.269> planning

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:30.750 
play that well so i recommend planning

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:33.950 
play that well so i recommend planning
right<00:00:31.019> white-winged<00:00:32.690> moderate<00:00:33.690> center

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:33.960 
right white-winged moderate center

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:36.500 
right white-winged moderate center
midfielder<00:00:34.440> he's<00:00:35.430> pretty<00:00:35.670> capable<00:00:35.969> playing

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.510 
midfielder he's pretty capable playing

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:38.590 
midfielder he's pretty capable playing
there<00:00:36.750> and<00:00:36.989> I<00:00:37.469> didn't<00:00:37.710> mean<00:00:37.800> to<00:00:37.829> click<00:00:38.070> that

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:38.600 
there and I didn't mean to click that

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:42.880 
there and I didn't mean to click that
but<00:00:39.600> it's<00:00:39.750> a<00:00:39.899> fully<00:00:40.260> capable<00:00:40.469> plane<00:00:41.040> there<00:00:41.309> and

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:42.890 
but it's a fully capable plane there and

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:45.110 
but it's a fully capable plane there and
find<00:00:43.890> the<00:00:44.010> Vox<00:00:44.190> probably<00:00:44.520> a<00:00:44.550> better<00:00:44.670> attacking

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120 
find the Vox probably a better attacking

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:46.850 
find the Vox probably a better attacking
midfielder<00:00:45.629> a<00:00:45.660> better<00:00:45.930> goal<00:00:46.170> scorers<00:00:46.500> and<00:00:46.710> he

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
midfielder a better goal scorers and he

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:49.910 
midfielder a better goal scorers and he
