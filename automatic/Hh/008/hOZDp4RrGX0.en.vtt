00:00:09.459 --> 00:00:14.629
 or latitudes 102,000 and well I did a lot 

00:00:12.260 --> 00:00:16.550
 women cim with line version 1.16 

00:00:14.629 --> 00:00:19.640
 pose within the secret plant of the 

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:22.099
 efe and bbva the plant 53 and the plant 

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:23.539
 47 how good a week ago I am a 

00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:25.760
 trick to get inside that idea 

00:00:23.539 --> 00:00:27.619
 burned and we can enter inside this 

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:29.660
 site that is totally secret that almost 

00:00:27.619 --> 00:00:32.210
 nobody knows what is the part that is not 

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:34.400
 is burned inside the fbi since it is a 

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:36.589
 Very rare site to see worth is very little 

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:38.360
 known and good and you can see a door 

00:00:36.589 --> 00:00:39.860
 that you can fly with a c4 me with this 

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:41.120
 I have been impressed it is worth it 

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:42.860
 shoot nothing happens but if good 

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:44.540
 11-4 the door explodes and lets you enter 

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:46.940
 so then let's go with the 

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:48.680
 tutorial of this trick and well then I'll 

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:50.420
 At a very simple step we simply take 

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:52.549
 a gualco helicopter that can 

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:54.710
 being the diver may already be the new one can 

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:56.689
 be the voice charge can be a plane if 

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:58.580
 you want and I'm in parachute and 

00:00:56.689 --> 00:01:00.290
 we'll have to go to the fbi building 

00:00:58.580 --> 00:01:02.089
 it's worth one of the highest of all 

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:04.189
 the map that good you can see clearly 

00:01:02.089 --> 00:01:06.260
 that puts efe and sees and what we have to 

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:07.790
 to do is park just above and 

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:09.289
 let's get into the burnt building and 

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:11.390
 I'm going to show you a route that you have to 

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:12.060
 follow and then a trick to go up to 

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:13.500
 building 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:15.420
 when we arrived, I always recommend 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:17.070
 burst the helicopter seven pieces 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:19.079
 It's worth it, in case we die 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:20.460
 that will surely happen to us what is going 

00:01:19.079 --> 00:01:21.570
 to pass is to take to stick a I'm going to 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:23.430
 say that we already have the cost here and 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:24.960
 We can not ask another voucher then 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:26.159
 well we have to run against this 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:27.960
 corner is worth and make our 

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:29.610
 character to fall that even this can 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:31.110
 be a bit difficult and many times 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:32.670
 it may happen that you fall and go to 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:34.860
 stay under the whole building and you go 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:36.270
 to die is worth this usually happens a lot 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:38.280
 usually more or less one of each 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:39.539
 four times then good one is that 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:41.759
 we are inside building you have to follow 

00:01:39.539 --> 00:01:43.380
 the road that I follow is already valid you will have to 

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:45.149
 come here through the door is up 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:46.649
 the stairs and you are going to have to arrive 

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:48.990
 until the place I die, which is the 

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:50.850
 Trick to be able to climb to the 53rd floor 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:52.979
 then well we will follow all the 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:54.390
 doors that I follow to not lose you what 

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:55.799
 good is to simply climb up and 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:56.729
 follow everything straight because there is no 

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:58.020
 Another exit 

00:01:56.729 --> 00:01:59.520
 you have to follow the doors all the time and 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:00.929
 it's already good how everything is 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:02.759
 Well, it can be a little messy 

00:02:00.929 --> 00:02:04.860
 but let's go perfectly works 

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:06.450
 it's very easy and good here you can see that 

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:08.670
 the site has already arrived, good is worth the site 

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:09.950
 good is this is this piece here that 

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:12.030
 you can see that there is a hole up 

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:13.440
 just the top part and good 

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:15.330
 we have to get into those cabinets 

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:16.620
 to do the trick it's worth this for 

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:17.760
 become very difficult ok we can 

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:18.780
 throw us between two and three minutes 

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:20.069
 doing it 

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:21.360
 and well we have to put ourselves in the 

00:02:20.069 --> 00:02:22.890
 right closet someone we put on 

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:24.870
 over the right and we'll start 

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:26.220
 jump until we go to the part of 

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:28.770
 up and this and do the building 

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:30.209
 secret is worth the building without burning like 

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:32.040
 you can see right now it 's all burnt 

00:02:30.209 --> 00:02:33.690
 ok and we just have to continue 

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:36.090
 straight all this and we will find the 

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:38.040
 normal plant of the fbi that good then I 

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:39.660
 I guess almost nobody knows this site 

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:41.220
 ok then what we have to do is 

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:43.290
 very easy, we sell here 

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:44.730
 right through this door here we go 

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:45.989
 to enter again to the right and 

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:47.400
 we will go up the stairs on the left 

00:02:45.989 --> 00:02:49.140
 ok you have to upload them up 

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:50.310
 so good when we find the 

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:52.170
 staircase is red we're going to have to 

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:53.910
 climb up and when I climb higher 

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:56.040
 above all it will be the 53rd floor 

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:57.690
 it's worth it and underneath it all will be the 47 that 

00:02:56.040 --> 00:03:00.120
 is very down there you can see that it is the 

00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:01.709
 53 then good on entering we can see 

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:03.150
 through that follows building well and 

00:03:01.709 --> 00:03:04.140
 we can see here the pictures placed by 

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:05.940
 the wall and all this that you see 

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:08.069
 is perfectly in fire alarm 

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:10.170
 and all that but here you can see the piece 

00:03:08.069 --> 00:03:12.209
 normal is worth this but equivocal to the 

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:13.530
 energy five campaigns and good for the 

00:03:12.209 --> 00:03:14.910
 crystals all this we can break if 

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:16.769
 we shot vouchers that we got nothing 

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:17.940
 but it can be done and there is a door that 

00:03:16.769 --> 00:03:18.930
 she is very pretty that she has taught him 

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:20.760
 beginning of the video that can be 

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:22.920
 bursting with a c4 voucher is like a box 

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:24.180
 strong that good this door if you 

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:25.340
 we shoot with a gun is not going to happen 

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:27.410
 nothing is worth because this 

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:29.450
 but instead if we put a c4 and the 

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:31.280
 is going to rub the door there you can see that 

00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:32.810
 I'm firing it and nothing happens and 

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:34.879
 leader to mention the c4 so you can 

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:36.860
 see is worth and inside what is a room 

00:03:34.879 --> 00:03:38.239
 of computer vale there are here two 

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:40.310
 computers as an office so 

00:03:38.239 --> 00:03:42.260
 say an office and tiny with the 

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:43.910
 wall computers is one on one side and 

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:45.319
 another for another and good because it is already worth 

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:47.150
 here we can bust them senators and 

00:03:45.319 --> 00:03:48.739
 all that then by the sides also 

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:50.690
 We have a computer room and more things 

00:03:48.739 --> 00:03:53.690
 reid is worth and below we have the 

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:55.190
 plant 47 then good then 

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:56.930
 we're just going to go down it's worth now 

00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:58.370
 well if at the bottom or are they 

00:03:56.930 --> 00:04:00.620
 a little more need so you can 

00:03:58.370 --> 00:04:02.720
 see for example the piece this is worth here 

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:04.670
 there are more computers and all this is like 

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:06.170
 a bigger office and we're going to add 

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:07.700
 the other part is worth the cesc door 

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:09.230
 it is good to open perfectly almost all 

00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:11.150
 there are some areas to open them but almost 

00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:12.440
 all of them let you open them, so a 

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:14.269
 site that is well done and all that 

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:15.920
 then we can continue to the other side that 

00:04:14.269 --> 00:04:18.079
 it's exactly the same thing worth here what 

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:19.729
 you can see that it is the same and it is already 

00:04:18.079 --> 00:04:22.070
 now let's go down to the bottom 

00:04:19.729 --> 00:04:24.169
 It's worth to plant number 47 

00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:25.610
 so forward the video and I go back to 

00:04:24.169 --> 00:04:27.289
 get to the 47th floor that does not have 

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:29.120
 many things we are simply going to lower 

00:04:27.289 --> 00:04:30.740
 all the stairs are worth the truth 

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:33.259
 they are quite long to download are 

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:34.340
 I think they are nacho ladder or so and 

00:04:33.259 --> 00:04:36.830
 once we download them all go to 

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:39.830
 find the 47th floor is worth here is the 

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:42.289
 49 then 48 and there's going to be the 

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:44.030
 47 then good when we go down already 

00:04:42.289 --> 00:04:45.919
 we will be able to see a door like this 

00:04:44.030 --> 00:04:47.630
 from here we are going to enter and you can see that 

00:04:45.919 --> 00:04:49.520
 know everything as yellow is worth there goes 

00:04:47.630 --> 00:04:50.690
 to see as yellow and the other part then 

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:52.699
 they will look black here you can not see 

00:04:50.690 --> 00:04:54.500
 as above then good here seems 

00:04:52.699 --> 00:04:56.449
 amount or one that is worth meets the 

00:04:54.500 --> 00:04:57.889
 that all yellow things are put on and 

00:04:56.449 --> 00:04:59.569
 that and it looks very bad the map then here 

00:04:57.889 --> 00:05:01.880
 the same goes it seems that everything looks very bad 

00:04:59.569 --> 00:05:03.319
 and good the truth that the plant 47 does not 

00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:05.000
 has many interesting things since 

00:05:03.319 --> 00:05:06.380
 are all the doors closed and what 

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:08.060
 unique interesting so to speak that 

00:05:06.380 --> 00:05:09.979
 has is that there is like an elevator that 

00:05:08.060 --> 00:05:11.750
 can open voucher simply opens and 

00:05:09.979 --> 00:05:13.039
 it is already do not do more things then 

00:05:11.750 --> 00:05:14.300
 Well, we'll have to enter through this 

00:05:13.039 --> 00:05:15.949
 door and you can see that there are two 

00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:17.630
 elevators is worth the elevator of the 

00:05:15.949 --> 00:05:19.400
 right does not work and that of des wants 

00:05:17.630 --> 00:05:20.840
 so it works and as you can see the 

00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:22.909
 extinguisher if the shots then fleet is worth 

00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:24.800
 a normal thing there you can see the plant 

00:05:22.909 --> 00:05:26.139
 47 which puts it right there we will go one 

00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:28.340
 elevator on the right and on the left 

00:05:26.139 --> 00:05:29.630
 then good can enter the 

00:05:28.340 --> 00:05:30.800
 right that is the only one that opens already 

00:05:29.630 --> 00:05:33.110
 what's on the left, it does not work 

00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:34.670
 it's worth only is there to propose 

00:05:33.110 --> 00:05:36.830
 and this is going to close but it will not happen 

00:05:34.670 --> 00:05:39.500
 nothing so good I like this trick 

00:05:36.830 --> 00:05:42.050
 from youtube like to comment and subscribe and 

00:05:39.500 --> 00:05:44.920
 well let's follow 256 for this trick would be 

00:05:42.050 --> 00:05:44.920
 perfect goodbye
