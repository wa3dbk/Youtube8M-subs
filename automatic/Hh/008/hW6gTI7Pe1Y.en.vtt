let's<00:00:06.680> take<00:00:07.009> a<00:00:07.040> look<00:00:07.250> at<00:00:07.429> Matt<00:00:07.639> cam<00:00:08.029> and<00:00:08.360> how<00:00:08.600> to

00:00:08.650 --> 00:00:08.660 
let's take a look at Matt cam and how to

00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:12.579 
let's take a look at Matt cam and how to
work<00:00:09.200> with<00:00:09.760> stock<00:00:10.760> material<00:00:11.629> used<00:00:12.110> to<00:00:12.230> define

00:00:12.579 --> 00:00:12.589 
work with stock material used to define

00:00:12.589 --> 00:00:15.640 
work with stock material used to define
stock<00:00:12.950> material<00:00:13.700> in<00:00:13.849> simultaneous<00:00:14.780> four<00:00:15.230> four

00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:15.650 
stock material in simultaneous four four

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:20.409 
stock material in simultaneous four four
axes<00:00:17.470> here<00:00:18.470> we<00:00:18.619> have<00:00:18.770> a<00:00:18.800> model<00:00:19.250> and<00:00:19.550> we<00:00:20.390> have

00:00:20.409 --> 00:00:20.419 
axes here we have a model and we have

00:00:20.419 --> 00:00:25.300 
axes here we have a model and we have
created<00:00:21.279> stopped<00:00:22.279> material<00:00:23.000> and<00:00:23.500> some<00:00:24.500> cap

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:25.310 
created stopped material and some cap

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:29.859 
created stopped material and some cap
surfaces<00:00:26.830> so<00:00:27.830> if<00:00:28.429> we<00:00:28.759> would<00:00:29.090> like<00:00:29.300> to<00:00:29.330> start

00:00:29.859 --> 00:00:29.869 
surfaces so if we would like to start

00:00:29.869 --> 00:00:37.299 
surfaces so if we would like to start
machine<00:00:30.679> this<00:00:31.960> we<00:00:33.370> select<00:00:35.680> the<00:00:36.680> model<00:00:37.070> for

00:00:37.299 --> 00:00:37.309 
machine this we select the model for

00:00:37.309 --> 00:00:43.539 
machine this we select the model for
Malcolm<00:00:37.540> and<00:00:39.519> we<00:00:41.500> select<00:00:42.500> cutter<00:00:42.920> for<00:00:43.489> the

00:00:43.539 --> 00:00:43.549 
Malcolm and we select cutter for the

00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:47.740 
Malcolm and we select cutter for the
roughing<00:00:44.530> we<00:00:45.530> could<00:00:45.830> pick<00:00:46.119> six<00:00:47.119> millimeter

00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:47.750 
roughing we could pick six millimeter

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:51.990 
roughing we could pick six millimeter
flat<00:00:48.350> and<00:00:49.000> 0.5<00:00:50.000> millimeters<00:00:50.690> talk<00:00:50.900> to<00:00:51.110> leave

00:00:51.990 --> 00:00:52.000 
flat and 0.5 millimeters talk to leave

00:00:52.000 --> 00:01:00.390 
flat and 0.5 millimeters talk to leave
we<00:00:53.229> show<00:00:54.610> stock<00:00:55.610> material<00:00:56.470> select<00:00:58.659> the<00:00:59.659> stock

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:00.400 
we show stock material select the stock

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:08.849 
we show stock material select the stock
and<00:01:02.769> then<00:01:03.769> we<00:01:04.010> select<00:01:04.369> the<00:01:06.640> rotary<00:01:07.640> axis<00:01:07.939> and

00:01:08.849 --> 00:01:08.859 
and then we select the rotary axis and

00:01:08.859 --> 00:01:13.620 
and then we select the rotary axis and
spindle<00:01:09.859> axis<00:01:10.810> and<00:01:11.810> then<00:01:12.469> it's<00:01:12.679> just<00:01:12.979> to

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:13.630 
spindle axis and then it's just to

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:26.230 
spindle axis and then it's just to
create<00:01:14.630> roughing<00:01:15.320> tool<00:01:15.530> path<00:01:17.229> click<00:01:18.229> OK

00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:26.240 

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:31.580 

and<00:01:27.240> I<00:01:27.630> we<00:01:27.840> have<00:01:27.960> the<00:01:28.170> roughing<00:01:28.650> tool<00:01:29.009> path<00:01:30.590> we

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:31.590 
and I we have the roughing tool path we

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:33.740 
and I we have the roughing tool path we
can<00:01:31.619> see<00:01:31.979> that<00:01:32.280> if<00:01:32.850> we<00:01:32.909> hide<00:01:33.270> the<00:01:33.509> stock

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 
can see that if we hide the stock

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:38.109 
can see that if we hide the stock
material<00:01:34.440> we<00:01:34.650> can<00:01:34.830> see<00:01:35.070> it<00:01:35.520> has<00:01:36.000> created

00:01:38.109 --> 00:01:38.119 
material we can see it has created

00:01:38.119 --> 00:01:43.700 
material we can see it has created
pocketing<00:01:39.830> rough<00:01:40.970> to<00:01:41.970> path<00:01:42.330> and<00:01:42.360> it<00:01:42.899> will<00:01:43.350> only

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:43.710 
pocketing rough to path and it will only

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:47.660 
pocketing rough to path and it will only
rough<00:01:43.920> where<00:01:44.880> it<00:01:45.030> could<00:01:45.869> find<00:01:46.170> material<00:01:47.159> from

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
rough where it could find material from

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:51.289 
rough where it could find material from
our<00:01:48.360> stock<00:01:48.780> model<00:01:49.259> and<00:01:49.740> the<00:01:50.490> stock<00:01:50.729> model<00:01:51.180> is

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:51.299 
our stock model and the stock model is

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:54.200 
our stock model and the stock model is
active<00:01:51.930> as<00:01:52.200> long<00:01:52.500> as<00:01:52.740> we<00:01:52.950> don't<00:01:53.100> reselect<00:01:54.000> the

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.210 
active as long as we don't reselect the

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:57.710 
active as long as we don't reselect the
model<00:01:54.570> or<00:01:54.840> select<00:01:55.409> a<00:01:55.530> new<00:01:55.710> stock<00:01:56.070> model<00:01:56.509> so<00:01:57.509> we

00:01:57.710 --> 00:01:57.720 
model or select a new stock model so we

00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:00.399 
model or select a new stock model so we
can<00:01:57.930> hide<00:01:58.140> the<00:01:58.350> toolpath<00:01:58.590> and<00:01:59.220> then<00:01:59.880> we<00:02:00.090> can

00:02:00.399 --> 00:02:00.409 
can hide the toolpath and then we can

00:02:00.409 --> 00:02:06.770 
can hide the toolpath and then we can
select<00:02:01.409> a<00:02:02.720> three<00:02:03.720> millimeter<00:02:04.399> Boland<00:02:05.399> and<00:02:05.780> we

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:06.780 
select a three millimeter Boland and we

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:19.059 
select a three millimeter Boland and we
can<00:02:07.130> create<00:02:08.750> Zed<00:02:09.750> level<00:02:10.200> finishing<00:02:10.739> toolpath

00:02:19.059 --> 00:02:19.069 

00:02:19.069 --> 00:02:23.770 

and<00:02:19.640> there<00:02:19.969> we<00:02:20.120> have<00:02:20.239> the<00:02:20.920> simultaneous<00:02:22.780> four

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:23.780 
and there we have the simultaneous four

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:29.470 
and there we have the simultaneous four
axes<00:02:24.319> third<00:02:25.099> level<00:02:25.609> finishing<00:02:26.180> to<00:02:26.390> both<00:02:28.480> now

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:29.480 
axes third level finishing to both now

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:35.920 
axes third level finishing to both now
we<00:02:29.950> use<00:02:30.950> the<00:02:31.340> cap<00:02:31.609> surfaces<00:02:33.370> so<00:02:34.599> mad<00:02:35.599> cam

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:35.930 
we use the cap surfaces so mad cam

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:39.099 
we use the cap surfaces so mad cam
didn't<00:02:36.349> create<00:02:36.650> any<00:02:36.950> two<00:02:37.250> paths<00:02:37.609> down<00:02:38.480> in<00:02:38.900> this

00:02:39.099 --> 00:02:39.109 
didn't create any two paths down in this

00:02:39.109 --> 00:02:45.119 
didn't create any two paths down in this
cavity<00:02:40.959> so<00:02:41.959> now<00:02:42.379> we<00:02:42.439> can<00:02:42.970> machine<00:02:43.970> those

00:02:45.119 --> 00:02:45.129 
cavity so now we can machine those

00:02:45.129 --> 00:02:50.830 
cavity so now we can machine those
afterwards<00:02:46.750> and<00:02:47.750> it's<00:02:47.989> just<00:02:48.349> to<00:02:49.389> hide<00:02:50.389> the<00:02:50.629> cap

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:50.840 
afterwards and it's just to hide the cap

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:58.440 
afterwards and it's just to hide the cap
surfaces<00:02:52.629> reflect<00:02:53.769> the<00:02:54.769> model<00:02:56.829> we<00:02:57.829> can

00:02:58.440 --> 00:02:58.450 
surfaces reflect the model we can

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:02.229 
surfaces reflect the model we can
machine<00:02:59.500> with<00:03:00.500> a<00:03:00.530> three<00:03:01.040> millimeter<00:03:01.340> captor

00:03:02.229 --> 00:03:02.239 
machine with a three millimeter captor

00:03:02.239 --> 00:03:08.199 
machine with a three millimeter captor
and<00:03:03.579> we<00:03:04.579> can<00:03:04.849> show<00:03:05.090> the<00:03:05.389> cap<00:03:05.629> surfaces<00:03:06.409> and<00:03:07.209> we

00:03:08.199 --> 00:03:08.209 
and we can show the cap surfaces and we

00:03:08.209 --> 00:03:13.750 
and we can show the cap surfaces and we
can<00:03:09.109> select<00:03:10.120> one<00:03:11.120> cap<00:03:11.480> surface<00:03:12.079> as<00:03:12.349> our<00:03:12.919> stock

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:13.760 
can select one cap surface as our stock

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:16.390 
can select one cap surface as our stock
material<00:03:14.569> the<00:03:15.230> stock<00:03:15.500> material<00:03:16.099> can<00:03:16.370> be

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:16.400 
material the stock material can be

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:23.559 
material the stock material can be
solids<00:03:17.150> and<00:03:17.389> surfaces<00:03:18.079> or<00:03:18.819> poly<00:03:19.819> surfaces<00:03:22.569> now

00:03:23.559 --> 00:03:23.569 
solids and surfaces or poly surfaces now

00:03:23.569 --> 00:03:30.640 
solids and surfaces or poly surfaces now
we<00:03:23.659> can<00:03:25.510> select<00:03:27.549> rotor<00:03:28.549> axis<00:03:29.000> and<00:03:29.650> spindle

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:30.650 
we can select rotor axis and spindle

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:45.660 
we can select rotor axis and spindle
axis<00:03:30.799> and<00:03:32.409> create<00:03:33.409> a<00:03:33.440> roughing<00:03:33.979> tool<00:03:34.190> path

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:45.670 

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:49.800 

and<00:03:46.270> we<00:03:46.510> can<00:03:46.720> see<00:03:46.930> it's<00:03:48.030> the<00:03:49.030> only<00:03:49.210> machine

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:49.810 
and we can see it's the only machine

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:52.530 
and we can see it's the only machine
where<00:03:50.770> it<00:03:50.860> could<00:03:51.040> find<00:03:51.340> material<00:03:52.060> from<00:03:52.330> our

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:52.540 
where it could find material from our

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:59.240 
where it could find material from our
stock<00:03:53.280> stopped<00:03:54.280> modeled<00:03:54.819> surface<00:03:55.980> so<00:03:56.980> we<00:03:57.190> can

00:03:59.240 --> 00:03:59.250 

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:06.440 

select<00:04:00.250> stock<00:04:00.910> material<00:04:01.890> on<00:04:02.890> this<00:04:03.190> side<00:04:04.380> and

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:06.450 
select stock material on this side and

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:16.909 
select stock material on this side and
create<00:04:07.450> a<00:04:07.540> roughing<00:04:08.050> to<00:04:08.230> both

00:04:16.909 --> 00:04:16.919 

00:04:16.919 --> 00:04:18.800 

and<00:04:17.459> there<00:04:17.669> we<00:04:17.819> have<00:04:17.849> the<00:04:18.180> roughing<00:04:18.569> tool<00:04:18.780> path

00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:18.810 
and there we have the roughing tool path

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:23.719 
and there we have the roughing tool path
on<00:04:19.349> the<00:04:19.469> other<00:04:19.620> side<00:04:20.009> and<00:04:22.249> now<00:04:23.249> we<00:04:23.310> can

00:04:23.719 --> 00:04:23.729 
on the other side and now we can

00:04:23.729 --> 00:04:34.909 
on the other side and now we can
simulate<00:04:26.569> everything<00:04:27.569> together<00:04:33.710> see<00:04:34.710> it

00:04:34.909 --> 00:04:34.919 
simulate everything together see it

00:04:34.919 --> 00:04:51.159 
simulate everything together see it
starts<00:04:35.699> to<00:04:35.789> create<00:04:36.150> the<00:04:37.009> roughing

00:04:51.159 --> 00:04:51.169 

00:04:51.169 --> 00:05:05.429 

and<00:04:51.259> the<00:04:52.009> Zedd<00:04:52.310> level<00:04:52.789> finishing<00:04:53.360> toolpath

00:05:05.429 --> 00:05:05.439 

00:05:05.439 --> 00:05:14.149 

and<00:05:05.979> the<00:05:06.249> roughing<00:05:06.729> tool<00:05:06.939> path

00:05:14.149 --> 00:05:14.159 

00:05:14.159 --> 00:05:25.070 

and<00:05:14.389> Ruffing<00:05:15.389> on<00:05:15.719> the<00:05:15.959> other<00:05:16.110> side

00:05:25.070 --> 00:05:25.080 

00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:29.020 

that's<00:05:26.009> how<00:05:26.490> it<00:05:26.669> works<00:05:27.330> when<00:05:28.199> using

00:05:29.020 --> 00:05:29.030 
that's how it works when using

00:05:29.030 --> 00:05:33.020 
that's how it works when using
user-defined<00:05:30.030> stock<00:05:30.900> models<00:05:31.409> in<00:05:32.000> mandiant

00:05:33.020 --> 00:05:33.030 
user-defined stock models in mandiant

00:05:33.030 --> 00:05:37.159 
user-defined stock models in mandiant
with<00:05:33.599> simultaneous<00:05:34.590> four<00:05:35.580> axes<00:05:36.060> thank<00:05:37.020> you

00:05:37.159 --> 00:05:37.169 
with simultaneous four axes thank you

00:05:37.169 --> 00:05:39.590 
with simultaneous four axes thank you
very<00:05:37.319> much
