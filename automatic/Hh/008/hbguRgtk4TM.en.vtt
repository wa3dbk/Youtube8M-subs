00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.589
 what good that they follow us and do not 

00:00:01.709 --> 00:00:07.529

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:18.290
 I know how important it is that yesterday we had 

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:20.210
 a talk just that many 

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:21.890
 Sometimes we do not realize what 

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:25.099
 wonderful that is our body 

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:26.720
 it produces incredible things and many times 

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:28.670
 we do not pay attention that we should 

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:30.650
 meet and I think it's important 

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:32.480
 give attention to what is taking us 

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:34.940
 and what brings us up that lowers us 

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:36.140
 every day that is our body like this 

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:38.000
 that we're going to use an alternative that the 

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:40.309
 today with salgado has us the 

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:43.059
 stem cells that wonderful we're going to 

00:00:40.309 --> 00:00:43.059
 see i want 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:46.530
 you knew that with the components of 

00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:48.840
 our blood we can achieve a complexion 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:51.420
 flexible and toned for all the 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:53.760
 no longer imagine it because now 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:55.260
 It is a beautiful reality because the implant 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:01:00.620
 from being a mother our body can 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:01:00.620
 fold that and much more let's see it 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:12.040
 we have in our clinic a 

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:14.380
 60-year-old patient who is in 

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:16.420
 a climacteric stage in a stage in 

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:18.970
 the one that menopause disorders 

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:23.190
 Well, she starts to feel symptoms 

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:26.079
 such as fatigue such as 

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:29.079
 dryness in your skin 

00:01:26.079 --> 00:01:29.079
 hot flashes 

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:34.460
 is ready to receive the 

00:01:31.159 --> 00:01:38.869
 what treatment will do the right now 

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:42.289
 doctor is to make two points of 

00:01:38.869 --> 00:01:45.789
 local anesthesia this is necessary for 

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:45.789
 to be able to perform the implantation 

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:53.680
 at this moment the doctor is 

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:57.840
 making an incision of medium 

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:59.880
 centimeter in the level of abdomen 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:03.390
 these two points are the points 

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:06.689
 specific acupuncture that is 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:09.330
 demonstrated is where we have a greater 

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:13.050
 blood supply so that the 

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:15.030
 implant work properly as 

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:17.260
 they notice the patient does not have any 

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:20.870
 annoyance 

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:26.260
 and what we are going to do is that 

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:30.590
 is going to introduce this implant that was 

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:34.190
 specially designed for her you have 

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:38.599
 a lyophilized implant obtained from 

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:42.430
 umbilical cord which is rich in 

00:02:38.599 --> 00:02:42.430
 amino acids in proteins 

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:48.850
 that will be completely compatible 

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:50.690
 with our patient the stem cells 

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:52.940
 what do we use 

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:55.870
 they are obtained through the placenta and 

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:58.409
 human umbilical cord 

00:02:55.870 --> 00:03:02.730
 what ensures biosecurity 

00:02:58.409 --> 00:03:02.730
 excellent in all our treatments 

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:12.129
 and to finish with a flourish we are going to 

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:14.239
 perform the application of stem cells 

00:03:12.129 --> 00:03:20.690
 specialized for the stage of 

00:03:14.239 --> 00:03:23.390
 menopause this implant is injectable 

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:25.640
 it's a liquid implant that was also 

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:27.350
 prepared in a particular way for 

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:30.500
 our patient 

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:32.780
 that likewise does not cause any kind 

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:34.940
 of disability and yes it is very important 

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:39.250
 mention that the patient must 

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:39.250
 return the review in a week 

00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:44.700
 to present a technique of 

00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:48.360
 facial rejuvenation made on the basis of 

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:51.480
 stem cells stem cells what 

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:55.770
 are going to do face and oval oval facial 

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:58.860
 and neck is to give a tonicity a 

00:03:55.770 --> 00:04:00.920
 firmness then to those tissues that are going 

00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:03.870
 hanging they are falling over time 

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:06.740
 the stem cells are stem cells of 

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:06.740
 autologous type 

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:16.910
 does is draw blood directly from 

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:22.280
 the patient's vein that subsequently 

00:04:16.910 --> 00:04:22.280
 is placed in a centrifuge 

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:37.690
 and the centrifugation process is 15 

00:04:34.630 --> 00:04:40.490
 minutes at 4000 revolutions per minute 

00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:43.490
 what will allow 

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:46.039
 that the plasma is separated for 

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:49.030
 later to be applied on the face 

00:04:46.039 --> 00:04:49.030
 of the patient 

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:54.230
 this is what we are going to apply in the 

00:04:52.879 --> 00:04:57.050
 face 

00:04:54.230 --> 00:05:00.770
 of the patient and this is what is going to 

00:04:57.050 --> 00:05:03.340
 Give all the support in neck oval and 

00:05:00.770 --> 00:05:03.340
 face 

00:05:06.719 --> 00:05:13.650
 once obtained the plasma 

00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:17.360
 what the doctor is going to be 

00:05:13.650 --> 00:05:17.360
 through a mesotherapy technique 

00:05:18.190 --> 00:05:24.660
 at different points the mesotherapy 

00:05:21.670 --> 00:05:28.840
 will help reach deep layers 

00:05:24.660 --> 00:05:31.180
 of the skin to stimulate the synthesis of 

00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:34.590
 supporting proteins which is collagen 

00:05:31.180 --> 00:05:34.590
 the elastin 

00:05:34.810 --> 00:05:42.639
 which will help to form networks 

00:05:38.040 --> 00:05:45.550
 to help the firmness and tone of the 

00:05:42.639 --> 00:05:48.540
 Skin the neck is also an area 

00:05:45.550 --> 00:05:48.540
 important 

00:05:49.370 --> 00:05:53.949
 and the application of stem cells 

00:05:54.660 --> 00:05:59.810
 will help that training precisely 

00:05:57.630 --> 00:06:03.110
 of the tissues 

00:05:59.810 --> 00:06:04.760
 and of proteins there is no 

00:06:03.110 --> 00:06:08.450
 contraindication for this type of 

00:06:04.760 --> 00:06:12.460
 treatment and the doctor what 

00:06:08.450 --> 00:06:12.460
 Recommend after the application 

00:06:12.540 --> 00:06:19.450
 take care 

00:06:15.310 --> 00:06:22.230
 of the sun exposure keep a 

00:06:19.450 --> 00:06:26.250
 adequate diet 

00:06:22.230 --> 00:06:28.620
 also use products that are 

00:06:26.250 --> 00:06:31.600
 compatible with your skin type 

00:06:28.620 --> 00:06:33.520
 incredible truth because in just 20 

00:06:31.600 --> 00:06:36.220
 minutes we started the regeneration of 

00:06:33.520 --> 00:06:38.100
 our skin do not hesitate to come as it is 

00:06:36.220 --> 00:06:40.689
 an ambulatory and painless process 

00:06:38.100 --> 00:06:43.509
 let's do it
