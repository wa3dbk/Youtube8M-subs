00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:34.079
 most important factor to consider e 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:36.750
 do not apply rozzone by touching 

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:40.350

 our motion without leaving one 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:08.670
 space in the region after the operation 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:12.360
 made with this lotion will disappear 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:16.229
 the coasts that it was so will leave i 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:20.630
 patients with the process from the rash is 

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:25.110
 the disappearance of the scabs is very easy 

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:28.409
 we have to wait for 45 minutes an hour 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:31.300
 from the effect of the reduction is a nice one 

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:34.360
 crusts movement 

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:37.720
 all this process is performed 

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:41.890
 the washing operation after apply 

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:45.240
 report and wait for 45 minutes for

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:55.800
 water that is not too hot or too hot 

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:59.470
 cold ie with warm water 

00:01:55.800 --> 00:02:02.350

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:06.040
 performed the rinsing process with 

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:07.180

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:19.830
 transplanted and to the neck region then 

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:22.000
 we risk it alone with warm water 

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:25.450
 we apply the washing process 

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:29.200
 after three days of hair transplantation 

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:33.480

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:38.230
 where we started washing the area 

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:42.459
 we can slowly start washing 

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:44.910
 the transplanted area rubbing with the 

00:02:42.459 --> 00:02:44.910

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:53.290
 after this wash 80 will disappear 

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:56.760
 90 percent off the coasts not 

00:02:53.290 --> 00:03:01.989
