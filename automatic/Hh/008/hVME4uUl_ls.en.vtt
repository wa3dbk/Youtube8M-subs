00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.110
 hello friends sometimes asks how 

00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:05.640
 eat sprouted grains 

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:09.780
 wheat because they are enough 

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:12.380
 tough here look so they are tough 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:12.380
 and dense and 

00:00:13.099 --> 00:00:17.940
 teeth at all chew them they are such 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:21.960
 elastic and chew them not very nice and 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:23.519
 not very comfortable and before i show 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:25.380
 one way to eat 

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:27.750
 comfortable enough germinated 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:29.519
 Grain would like to remind that any 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:32.940
 germinated grain need to be as good as possible 

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:37.969
 flush more often and 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:37.969
 This is done using a regular colander. 

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:47.690
 we pour the necessary portion 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:57.320
 that's the amount for one 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:01:00.300
 man will be quite enough and 

00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:02.690
 Now I try it under the stream of cold 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:02.690
 water 

00:01:14.619 --> 00:01:24.530
 washing went successfully put the grain 

00:01:18.079 --> 00:01:26.240
 in the blender in the mixer we are with him with a mixer 

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:27.530
 must be sufficient order somewhere 

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:30.709
 five hundred or 600 

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:33.170
 if it is less powerful then it will be 

00:01:30.709 --> 00:01:36.020
 Of course a little while but enough 

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:37.929
 its not only now what is there 

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:41.530
 subtleties 

00:01:37.929 --> 00:01:44.920
 in order to use 

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:49.880
 not very powerful blender this blender 

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:52.329
 520 raw foodists who often use to 

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:57.200
 often drink such cocktails they usually 

00:01:52.329 --> 00:02:02.860
 buy more powerful before 

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:05.270
 do zirgan cocktail should be mixed or 

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:11.110
 grind in a little water 

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:11.110
 for a start close the lid turn on 

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:20.150
 fiber was a little speed here dick 

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:24.099
 as a mixer, it is quite low-power 

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:24.099
 he has little speed 

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:33.390
 the smaller the particles will be winter 

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:34.980
 ground so pleasant to drink 

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:38.330
 cocktail should ideally work 

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:38.330
 such a homogeneous mass 

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:50.490
 you can periodically try 

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:52.910
 pulsating mode here I am now at it 

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:56.450
 I push practically nothing changes 

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:56.450
 just because 

00:02:56.520 --> 00:03:01.130
 I repeat the power of this device is not 

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:01.130
 very big 

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:08.730
 that I am a little speed and add 

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:19.380
 wheat grinds quite hard 

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:22.340
 there are much more suitable for this 

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:22.340
 cereals operations 

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:26.680
 let's wait wait some more 

00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:38.420
 I repeat the less being 

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:38.420
 pleasant cocktail is to strengthen 

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:47.099
 there are still enough particles here 

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:49.610
 major we will stand when they become 

00:03:47.099 --> 00:03:49.610
 even smaller 

00:03:54.440 --> 00:04:00.420
 I will try the speed because absolutely 

00:03:57.700 --> 00:04:00.420
 mixed with 

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:06.780
 if you pay attention not all wear 

00:04:04.239 --> 00:04:06.780
 external 

00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:13.540
 treatment 

00:04:14.569 --> 00:04:17.160
 performs the function 

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:18.600
 OK 

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:21.130
 but nevertheless this device is enough 

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:23.610
 simple and for everyday use 

00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:23.610
 here to me 

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:30.590
 particles that fall on the edge about 

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:33.610
 already small enough 

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:33.610
 wait she became single 

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:39.220
 look for me these pieces already 

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:41.260
 small enough I'll stop him now 

00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:43.060
 because wait still because 

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:44.060
 not cleaned so pleasant because 

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:46.430
 youtube 

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:47.620
 he already has enough peace 

00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:56.320
 will stop 

00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:58.300
 this barrel organ is now the easiest 

00:04:56.320 --> 00:05:02.350
 fact 

00:04:58.300 --> 00:05:05.750
 by which you can give a taste 

00:05:02.350 --> 00:05:11.479
 this cocktail is a banana he 

00:05:05.750 --> 00:05:14.540
 inexpensive sweet sold at any 

00:05:11.479 --> 00:05:18.250
 time of day in almost any store 

00:05:14.540 --> 00:05:20.510
 where are the products sold and most importantly 

00:05:18.250 --> 00:05:23.720
 bananas grow in poor enough 

00:05:20.510 --> 00:05:25.330
 countries and in these countries are generally not 

00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:27.620
 enough money for all kinds of body 

00:05:25.330 --> 00:05:31.000
 inorganic fertilizers for all chemicals 

00:05:27.620 --> 00:05:32.930
 so ecological banana she 

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:37.010
 high enough without help 

00:05:32.930 --> 00:05:39.250
 saved now add water 

00:05:37.010 --> 00:05:39.250
 drinking 

00:05:43.810 --> 00:05:48.940
 but that amount for one person 

00:05:46.870 --> 00:05:51.760
 enough for two 

00:05:48.940 --> 00:05:53.560
 like this the daily dose needs sufficient 

00:05:51.760 --> 00:05:57.490
 in order to maintain the body in 

00:05:53.560 --> 00:06:02.730
 good mood in good here in 

00:05:57.490 --> 00:06:02.730
 condition go on now mix 

00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:15.729
 woman develops fast enough 

00:06:09.190 --> 00:06:26.789
 long hold no sense open 

00:06:15.729 --> 00:06:26.789
 cover pour glass 

00:06:38.789 --> 00:06:41.789
 mood 

00:06:51.620 --> 00:06:53.650
 but
