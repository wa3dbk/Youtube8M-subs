that but then there's this so I need to

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:15.860 
that but then there's this so I need to
compensate<00:02:14.550> for<00:02:14.910> that<00:02:14.940> I<00:02:15.270> mean<00:02:15.540> we<00:02:15.660> make

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:15.870 
compensate for that I mean we make

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:20.570 
compensate for that I mean we make
ourselves<00:02:16.050> crazy<00:02:17.000> doing<00:02:18.000> this<00:02:18.380> ok<00:02:19.380> because<00:02:20.220> we

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:20.580 
ourselves crazy doing this ok because we

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:23.390 
ourselves crazy doing this ok because we
haven't<00:02:20.910> really<00:02:21.120> learned<00:02:21.480> to<00:02:21.900> to<00:02:22.830> get<00:02:23.100> to<00:02:23.280> that

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:23.400 
haven't really learned to to get to that

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:25.760 
haven't really learned to to get to that
place<00:02:23.610> inside<00:02:24.209> where<00:02:25.170> we<00:02:25.200> just<00:02:25.500> learn<00:02:25.740> to

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:25.770 
place inside where we just learn to

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:30.170 
place inside where we just learn to
trust<00:02:26.280> the<00:02:26.550> flow<00:02:28.370> because<00:02:29.370> we've<00:02:29.610> not

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:30.180 
trust the flow because we've not

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:32.980 
trust the flow because we've not
embraced<00:02:30.780> the<00:02:31.260> flow<00:02:31.590> in<00:02:31.950> a<00:02:32.430> very<00:02:32.670> long<00:02:32.910> time

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:32.990 
embraced the flow in a very long time

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:35.240 
embraced the flow in a very long time
now<00:02:33.990> I<00:02:34.020> don't<00:02:34.200> necessarily<00:02:34.320> mean<00:02:35.130> the

it<00:04:21.940> is<00:04:22.060> happening<00:04:22.600> okay<00:04:23.260> the<00:04:23.830> blinds<00:04:24.100> are

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:24.280 
it is happening okay the blinds are

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:27.120 
it is happening okay the blinds are
being<00:04:24.490> lifted<00:04:25.650> people<00:04:26.650> are<00:04:26.740> coming<00:04:26.860> out<00:04:27.100> of

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:27.130 
being lifted people are coming out of

00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:30.000 
being lifted people are coming out of
their<00:04:27.310> comas<00:04:27.729> and<00:04:28.530> this<00:04:29.530> is<00:04:29.680> what<00:04:29.800> it's<00:04:29.950> about

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:30.010 
their comas and this is what it's about

00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:40.390 
their comas and this is what it's about
and<00:04:30.430> it's<00:04:31.360> happening<00:04:31.570> in<00:04:31.930> all<00:04:32.050> walks<00:04:32.350> of<00:04:32.530> life

00:04:40.390 --> 00:04:40.400 

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:42.640 

let's<00:04:41.060> take<00:04:41.270> the<00:04:41.389> 2012<00:04:41.960> scenario<00:04:42.410> for<00:04:42.590> a

00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:42.650 
let's take the 2012 scenario for a

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:47.200 
let's take the 2012 scenario for a
moment<00:04:42.830> let<00:04:43.550> suppose<00:04:45.699> there<00:04:46.699> was<00:04:46.820> going<00:04:47.060> to<00:04:47.180> be

00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:47.210 
moment let suppose there was going to be

00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:51.159 
moment let suppose there was going to be
a<00:04:47.300> pole<00:04:47.570> shift<00:04:49.479> okay<00:04:50.479> this<00:04:50.630> is<00:04:50.780> strictly<00:04:50.960> a

00:04:51.159 --> 00:04:51.169 
a pole shift okay this is strictly a

00:04:51.169 --> 00:04:55.060 
a pole shift okay this is strictly a
hypothetical<00:04:51.860> all<00:04:52.310> right<00:04:52.490> and<00:04:53.949> it's<00:04:54.949> an

00:04:55.060 --> 00:04:55.070 
hypothetical all right and it's an

00:04:55.070 --> 00:04:59.140 
hypothetical all right and it's an
interesting<00:04:55.250> lesson<00:04:56.169> exercise<00:04:58.030> let<00:04:59.030> us

00:04:59.140 --> 00:04:59.150 
interesting lesson exercise let us

00:04:59.150 --> 00:05:03.219 
interesting lesson exercise let us
suppose<00:04:59.389> for<00:04:59.600> a<00:04:59.660> moment<00:04:59.720> that<00:05:02.110> there<00:05:03.110> was

00:05:03.219 --> 00:05:03.229 
suppose for a moment that there was

00:05:03.229 --> 00:05:07.659 
suppose for a moment that there was
going<00:05:03.410> to<00:05:03.500> be<00:05:03.560> a<00:05:03.919> pole<00:05:04.789> shift<00:05:05.120> in<00:05:06.430> half<00:05:07.430> of<00:05:07.610> the

00:05:07.659 --> 00:05:07.669 
going to be a pole shift in half of the

00:05:07.669 --> 00:05:09.700 
going to be a pole shift in half of the
world's<00:05:07.910> population<00:05:08.169> was<00:05:09.169> going<00:05:09.380> to<00:05:09.440> be<00:05:09.530> gone

00:05:09.700 --> 00:05:09.710 
world's population was going to be gone

00:05:09.710 --> 00:05:12.249 
world's population was going to be gone
that<00:05:10.090> the<00:05:11.090> world<00:05:11.270> could<00:05:11.419> only<00:05:11.600> sustain<00:05:11.810> half

00:05:12.249 --> 00:05:12.259 
that the world could only sustain half

00:05:12.259 --> 00:05:15.010 
that the world could only sustain half
and<00:05:12.639> the<00:05:13.639> government<00:05:14.030> came<00:05:14.210> out<00:05:14.360> forward<00:05:14.840> and

00:05:15.010 --> 00:05:15.020 
and the government came out forward and

00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:16.960 
and the government came out forward and
said<00:05:15.199> hey<00:05:15.380> this<00:05:15.949> is<00:05:16.130> really<00:05:16.430> what's<00:05:16.610> going<00:05:16.850> to

00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:16.970 
said hey this is really what's going to

00:05:16.970 --> 00:05:18.670 
said hey this is really what's going to
happen<00:05:17.330> and<00:05:18.260> we've<00:05:18.380> been<00:05:18.530> preparing

00:05:18.670 --> 00:05:18.680 
happen and we've been preparing

00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:20.409 
happen and we've been preparing
ourselves<00:05:19.100> we<00:05:19.699> built<00:05:19.970> our<00:05:20.090> underground

00:05:20.409 --> 00:05:20.419 
ourselves we built our underground

00:05:20.419 --> 00:05:22.240 
ourselves we built our underground
facilities<00:05:20.960> sorry<00:05:21.620> they're<00:05:21.830> not<00:05:21.860> for<00:05:22.220> you

00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:22.250 
facilities sorry they're not for you

00:05:22.250 --> 00:05:24.129 
facilities sorry they're not for you
we've<00:05:23.090> been<00:05:23.240> building<00:05:23.419> bases<00:05:23.870> on<00:05:24.020> the<00:05:24.050> moon

00:05:24.129 --> 00:05:24.139 
we've been building bases on the moon

00:05:24.139 --> 00:05:27.219 
we've been building bases on the moon
and<00:05:24.440> mars<00:05:24.590> sorry<00:05:25.490> they're<00:05:25.729> not<00:05:25.760> for<00:05:26.150> you<00:05:26.229> and

00:05:27.219 --> 00:05:27.229 
and mars sorry they're not for you and

00:05:27.229 --> 00:05:29.379 
and mars sorry they're not for you and
we<00:05:27.350> have<00:05:27.470> all<00:05:27.620> this<00:05:27.740> advanced<00:05:28.190> technology<00:05:28.850> but

00:05:29.379 --> 00:05:29.389 
we have all this advanced technology but

00:05:29.389 --> 00:05:30.490 
we have all this advanced technology but
there's<00:05:29.570> no<00:05:29.660> point<00:05:29.930> giving<00:05:30.080> it<00:05:30.320> to<00:05:30.410> you

00:05:30.490 --> 00:05:30.500 
there's no point giving it to you

00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:32.110 
there's no point giving it to you
because<00:05:30.590> all<00:05:31.190> this<00:05:31.430> is<00:05:31.520> going<00:05:31.639> to<00:05:31.729> happen<00:05:31.849> to

00:05:32.110 --> 00:05:32.120 
because all this is going to happen to

00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:35.080 
because all this is going to happen to
the<00:05:32.210> planet<00:05:32.660> you're<00:05:33.530> on<00:05:33.560> your<00:05:33.889> own<00:05:33.970> not<00:05:34.970> that

00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:35.090 
the planet you're on your own not that

00:05:35.090 --> 00:05:44.129 
the planet you're on your own not that
they<00:05:35.210> would<00:05:35.360> ever<00:05:35.479> ever<00:05:35.930> be<00:05:36.229> that<00:05:36.410> honest<00:05:37.599> okay

00:05:44.129 --> 00:05:44.139 

00:05:44.139 --> 00:05:48.040 

okay<00:05:45.139> let's<00:05:45.770> just<00:05:45.860> suppose<00:05:46.690> so<00:05:47.690> let's<00:05:47.900> suppose

00:05:48.040 --> 00:05:48.050 
okay let's just suppose so let's suppose

00:05:48.050 --> 00:05:52.570 
okay let's just suppose so let's suppose
you<00:05:48.800> now<00:05:49.070> knew<00:05:49.400> for<00:05:49.639> a<00:05:49.669> fact<00:05:50.380> that<00:05:51.380> we<00:05:51.650> had<00:05:51.830> year

00:05:52.570 --> 00:05:52.580 
you now knew for a fact that we had year

00:05:52.580 --> 00:05:57.669 
you now knew for a fact that we had year
and<00:05:52.699> a<00:05:52.820> half<00:05:52.940> to<00:05:53.150> two<00:05:53.180> years<00:05:54.669> nope
