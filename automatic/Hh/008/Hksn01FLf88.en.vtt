before the match he was already chewing

00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:41.640 
before the match he was already chewing
it<00:00:39.190> he's<00:00:39.520> ready<00:00:39.820> to<00:00:39.970> go<00:00:40.120> and<00:00:40.930> I<00:00:41.140> am<00:00:41.290> so<00:00:41.620> excited

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:41.650 
it he's ready to go and I am so excited

00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:43.740 
it he's ready to go and I am so excited
because<00:00:42.160> this<00:00:42.460> is<00:00:42.610> going<00:00:42.760> to<00:00:42.850> finish<00:00:43.030> up<00:00:43.330> the

00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:43.750 
because this is going to finish up the

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:46.020 
because this is going to finish up the
round<00:00:43.960> of<00:00:44.080> 36<00:00:44.530> and<00:00:44.680> the<00:00:44.830> best<00:00:45.040> possible<00:00:45.250> way<00:00:45.580> I

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:46.030 
round of 36 and the best possible way I

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:50.580 
round of 36 and the best possible way I
think<00:00:47.280> not<00:00:48.280> only<00:00:48.309> because<00:00:48.940> stork<00:00:49.360> is<00:00:49.590> involved

00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:50.590 
think not only because stork is involved

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:53.580 
think not only because stork is involved
but<00:00:51.160> I<00:00:51.190> think<00:00:51.400> lo<00:00:51.879> mo<00:00:51.910> is<00:00:52.360> up<00:00:52.840> to<00:00:53.020> the<00:00:53.140> task<00:00:53.170> of

00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:53.590 
but I think lo mo is up to the task of

00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:55.710 
but I think lo mo is up to the task of
beating<00:00:54.010> stork<00:00:54.340> if<00:00:54.550> he<00:00:54.820> really<00:00:55.120> really<00:00:55.360> wants

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:55.720 
beating stork if he really really wants

00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:58.950 
beating stork if he really really wants
to<00:00:56.100> even<00:00:57.100> though<00:00:57.160> store<00:00:57.430> keys<00:00:57.790> I'd<00:00:58.390> say<00:00:58.720> he's

00:00:58.950 --> 00:00:58.960 
to even though store keys I'd say he's

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:01.500 
to even though store keys I'd say he's
probably<00:00:59.290> the<00:00:59.470> most<00:00:59.590> consistent<00:01:00.040> player<00:01:00.520> in

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:54.290 
does actually lose today but I think

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:55.870 
does actually lose today but I think
it's<00:02:54.410> actually<00:02:54.560> possible<00:02:54.950> lomos<00:02:55.580> a<00:02:55.610> good

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:55.880 
it's actually possible lomos a good

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:59.410 
it's actually possible lomos a good
player<00:02:56.330> obviously<00:02:57.200> a<00:02:57.230> very<00:02:57.470> good<00:02:57.680> Terran<00:02:58.420> he

00:02:59.410 --> 00:02:59.420 
player obviously a very good Terran he

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:01.720 
player obviously a very good Terran he
chews<00:02:59.660> gum<00:02:59.900> all<00:03:00.080> the<00:03:00.200> time<00:03:00.440> which<00:03:00.709> I<00:03:01.069> hear<00:03:01.580> that

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:01.730 
chews gum all the time which I hear that

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:03.280 
chews gum all the time which I hear that
chewing<00:03:01.910> gum<00:03:02.180> can<00:03:02.450> actually<00:03:02.780> make<00:03:02.930> your<00:03:03.110> brain

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:03.290 
chewing gum can actually make your brain

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:05.680 
chewing gum can actually make your brain
work<00:03:03.620> like<00:03:04.160> six<00:03:04.730> percent<00:03:05.120> faster<00:03:05.330> or

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:05.690 
work like six percent faster or

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:08.740 
work like six percent faster or
something<00:03:05.959> like<00:03:06.080> that<00:03:06.140> so<00:03:06.610> obviously<00:03:07.610> that<00:03:08.510> is

00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:08.750 
something like that so obviously that is

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:11.890 
something like that so obviously that is
going<00:03:09.049> to<00:03:09.110> work<00:03:09.230> in<00:03:09.380> his<00:03:09.470> favor<00:03:10.450> what's<00:03:11.450> dork

up yet but stork as soon as dragoon
range<00:06:06.110> comes<00:06:06.349> up<00:06:06.500> I<00:06:06.590> think<00:06:06.800> he's<00:06:06.889> going<00:06:07.010> to<00:06:07.099> try

00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:07.250 
range comes up I think he's going to try

00:06:07.250 --> 00:06:09.550 
range comes up I think he's going to try
to<00:06:07.280> attack<00:06:07.669> here<00:06:07.910> because<00:06:08.810> Loma<00:06:09.110> is<00:06:09.139> putting

00:06:09.550 --> 00:06:09.560 
to attack here because Loma is putting

00:06:09.560 --> 00:06:10.900 
to attack here because Loma is putting
down<00:06:09.710> his<00:06:09.860> expansion<00:06:10.310> he's<00:06:10.610> going<00:06:10.789> to<00:06:10.849> be

00:06:10.900 --> 00:06:10.910 
down his expansion he's going to be

00:06:10.910 --> 00:06:13.180 
down his expansion he's going to be
limited<00:06:11.150> as<00:06:11.930> far<00:06:11.990> as<00:06:12.200> troop<00:06:12.410> count<00:06:12.620> goes<00:06:12.860> and

00:06:13.180 --> 00:06:13.190 
limited as far as troop count goes and

00:06:13.190 --> 00:06:14.440 
limited as far as troop count goes and
Stuart<00:06:13.580> could<00:06:13.789> definitely<00:06:14.150> take<00:06:14.389> advantage

00:06:14.440 --> 00:06:14.450 
Stuart could definitely take advantage

00:06:14.450 --> 00:06:16.390 
Stuart could definitely take advantage
of<00:06:14.900> this<00:06:15.050> because<00:06:15.560> I<00:06:15.680> don't<00:06:15.860> think<00:06:16.039> stork<00:06:16.310> is

00:06:16.390 --> 00:06:16.400 
of this because I don't think stork is

00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:18.629 
of this because I don't think stork is
going<00:06:16.669> for<00:06:16.849> his<00:06:16.940> nexus<00:06:17.330> at<00:06:17.570> the<00:06:17.720> moment

00:06:18.629 --> 00:06:18.639 
going for his nexus at the moment

00:06:18.639 --> 00:06:21.909 
going for his nexus at the moment
Dragoon<00:06:19.639> range<00:06:19.820> did<00:06:20.090> finish<00:06:20.360> and<00:06:20.750> I<00:06:21.740> don't

00:06:21.909 --> 00:06:21.919 
Dragoon range did finish and I don't

00:06:21.919 --> 00:06:23.230 
Dragoon range did finish and I don't
think<00:06:22.010> he<00:06:22.160> has<00:06:22.250> any<00:06:22.430> more<00:06:22.610> buildings<00:06:22.970> out<00:06:23.090> here

00:06:23.230 --> 00:06:23.240 
think he has any more buildings out here

00:06:23.240 --> 00:06:24.730 
think he has any more buildings out here
so<00:06:23.389> I<00:06:23.419> think<00:06:23.599> he's<00:06:23.780> just<00:06:23.930> committing<00:06:24.349> to<00:06:24.590> an

00:06:24.730 --> 00:06:24.740 
so I think he's just committing to an

00:06:24.740 --> 00:06:28.990 
so I think he's just committing to an
army<00:06:25.070> here<00:06:25.310> to<00:06:25.460> a<00:06:25.789> stop<00:06:26.270> lumo<00:06:27.880> fighting<00:06:28.880> off

00:06:28.990 --> 00:06:29.000 
army here to a stop lumo fighting off

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:30.730 
army here to a stop lumo fighting off
the<00:06:29.030> initial<00:06:29.450> vulture<00:06:29.720> but<00:06:29.930> man<00:06:30.229> storks<00:06:30.620> got

00:06:30.730 --> 00:06:30.740 
the initial vulture but man storks got

00:06:30.740 --> 00:06:32.529 
the initial vulture but man storks got
to<00:06:30.830> be<00:06:30.889> very<00:06:30.919> careful<00:06:31.099> here<00:06:31.550> he<00:06:32.240> saw<00:06:32.389> that

00:06:32.529 --> 00:06:32.539 
to be very careful here he saw that

00:06:32.539 --> 00:06:34.390 
to be very careful here he saw that
vulture<00:06:32.750> coming<00:06:33.169> up<00:06:33.260> coming<00:06:33.889> out<00:06:34.039> so<00:06:34.310> he

00:06:34.390 --> 00:06:34.400 
vulture coming up coming out so he

00:06:34.400 --> 00:06:37.350 
vulture coming up coming out so he
probably<00:06:34.760> assumes<00:06:35.690> that<00:06:36.110> mines<00:06:36.590> are<00:06:36.770> out<00:06:36.889> here

00:06:37.350 --> 00:06:37.360 
probably assumes that mines are out here

00:06:37.360 --> 00:06:40.480 
probably assumes that mines are out here
he<00:06:38.360> might<00:06:38.570> try<00:06:38.780> some<00:06:38.990> tricky<00:06:39.470> micro<00:06:39.919> to<00:06:40.340> get

00:06:40.480 --> 00:06:40.490 
he might try some tricky micro to get

00:06:40.490 --> 00:06:42.060 
he might try some tricky micro to get
rid<00:06:40.639> of<00:06:40.669> those<00:06:40.820> minds<00:06:41.270> which<00:06:41.360> I<00:06:41.510> love<00:06:41.750> to<00:06:41.870> see

00:06:42.060 --> 00:06:42.070 
rid of those minds which I love to see

00:06:42.070 --> 00:06:44.920 
rid of those minds which I love to see
anti-mine<00:06:43.070> micro<00:06:43.580> from<00:06:43.820> any<00:06:43.970> race<00:06:44.210> it's<00:06:44.720> just

00:06:44.920 --> 00:06:44.930 
anti-mine micro from any race it's just

00:06:44.930 --> 00:06:47.290 
anti-mine micro from any race it's just
hilarious<00:06:45.050> to<00:06:45.530> watch<00:06:45.610> it's<00:06:46.610> usually<00:06:46.940> a<00:06:47.120> bit
