today<00:00:05.520> in<00:00:05.700> after-effects<00:00:06.299> we're<00:00:06.509> going<00:00:06.720> to<00:00:06.810> be

00:00:06.889 --> 00:00:06.899 
today in after-effects we're going to be

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:08.570 
today in after-effects we're going to be
taking<00:00:07.259> a<00:00:07.319> look<00:00:07.500> at<00:00:07.680> creating<00:00:08.069> this<00:00:08.220> kinetic

00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:08.580 
taking a look at creating this kinetic

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:10.940 
taking a look at creating this kinetic
type<00:00:08.910> effect<00:00:09.360> so<00:00:10.080> to<00:00:10.200> get<00:00:10.290> started<00:00:10.440> I'm<00:00:10.800> going

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:10.950 
type effect so to get started I'm going

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:13.370 
type effect so to get started I'm going
to<00:00:11.070> go<00:00:11.250> up<00:00:11.490> to<00:00:11.730> composition<00:00:12.179> and<00:00:12.660> create<00:00:13.049> a<00:00:13.080> new

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:13.380 
to go up to composition and create a new

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:16.129 
to go up to composition and create a new
composition<00:00:13.620> now<00:00:14.610> I'll<00:00:14.700> be<00:00:14.790> making<00:00:15.089> my<00:00:15.269> 1920

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:16.139 
composition now I'll be making my 1920

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:19.070 
composition now I'll be making my 1920
by<00:00:16.350> 1080<00:00:16.740> and<00:00:16.980> clicking<00:00:17.460> okay<00:00:17.820> so<00:00:18.690> after<00:00:18.960> that

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:19.080 
by 1080 and clicking okay so after that

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:20.779 
by 1080 and clicking okay so after that
we<00:00:19.230> need<00:00:19.380> to<00:00:19.439> first<00:00:19.680> start<00:00:19.890> by<00:00:20.220> creating<00:00:20.490> some

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:20.789 
we need to first start by creating some

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:22.790 
we need to first start by creating some
text<00:00:21.150> or<00:00:21.270> other<00:00:21.449> graphics<00:00:22.020> on<00:00:22.170> the<00:00:22.289> stage<00:00:22.500> to

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:22.800 
text or other graphics on the stage to

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:24.679 
text or other graphics on the stage to
start<00:00:23.039> animating<00:00:23.460> so<00:00:24.090> I'll<00:00:24.180> go<00:00:24.359> up<00:00:24.390> and<00:00:24.600> grab

00:00:24.679 --> 00:00:24.689 
start animating so I'll go up and grab

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:26.029 
start animating so I'll go up and grab
my<00:00:24.930> text<00:00:25.140> tool<00:00:25.439> and<00:00:25.650> then<00:00:25.769> create<00:00:26.010> two

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:26.039 
my text tool and then create two

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:28.160 
my text tool and then create two
separate<00:00:26.609> words<00:00:26.880> now<00:00:27.539> I'll<00:00:27.660> make<00:00:27.779> the<00:00:27.900> letters

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:28.170 
separate words now I'll make the letters

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:30.769 
separate words now I'll make the letters
rcg<00:00:28.740> larger<00:00:29.250> and<00:00:29.429> white<00:00:29.849> and<00:00:30.119> then<00:00:30.359> position

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:30.779 
rcg larger and white and then position

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:33.049 
rcg larger and white and then position
those<00:00:30.929> on<00:00:31.109> top<00:00:31.320> of<00:00:31.500> the<00:00:31.619> word<00:00:31.800> tutorials<00:00:32.489> in<00:00:32.640> an

00:00:33.049 --> 00:00:33.059 
those on top of the word tutorials in an

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:35.420 
those on top of the word tutorials in an
orangish<00:00:33.420> yellow<00:00:33.480> color<00:00:34.050> so<00:00:34.890> since<00:00:35.100> we<00:00:35.250> want

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:35.430 
orangish yellow color so since we want

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:36.830 
orangish yellow color so since we want
to<00:00:35.489> be<00:00:35.579> able<00:00:35.640> to<00:00:35.760> animate<00:00:36.180> these<00:00:36.360> two<00:00:36.600> pieces

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:36.840 
to be able to animate these two pieces

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:38.780 
to be able to animate these two pieces
of<00:00:36.989> text<00:00:37.380> as<00:00:37.469> a<00:00:37.500> whole<00:00:37.800> we<00:00:38.370> need<00:00:38.489> to<00:00:38.610> select

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:38.790 
of text as a whole we need to select

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:40.400 
of text as a whole we need to select
both<00:00:39.059> of<00:00:39.090> these<00:00:39.360> layers<00:00:39.629> and<00:00:39.930> then<00:00:40.079> go<00:00:40.170> up<00:00:40.260> to

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:40.410 
both of these layers and then go up to

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:42.500 
both of these layers and then go up to
layer<00:00:40.649> and<00:00:40.890> then<00:00:41.309> down<00:00:41.489> to<00:00:41.520> pre<00:00:41.879> compose<00:00:42.210> all

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.510 
layer and then down to pre compose all

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:44.299 
layer and then down to pre compose all
the<00:00:42.750> way<00:00:42.840> at<00:00:42.930> the<00:00:42.989> bottom<00:00:43.140> of<00:00:43.379> the<00:00:43.500> menu<00:00:43.649> this

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:44.309 
the way at the bottom of the menu this

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:46.069 
the way at the bottom of the menu this
will<00:00:44.520> then<00:00:44.670> move<00:00:44.879> these<00:00:45.030> two<00:00:45.300> layers<00:00:45.570> into<00:00:46.050> a

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079 
will then move these two layers into a

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:47.990 
will then move these two layers into a
larger<00:00:46.530> layer<00:00:46.739> essentially<00:00:47.309> grouping<00:00:47.850> them

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
larger layer essentially grouping them

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:49.910 
larger layer essentially grouping them
so<00:00:48.750> now<00:00:48.840> that<00:00:48.930> we<00:00:49.050> have<00:00:49.079> this<00:00:49.320> done<00:00:49.559> we<00:00:49.739> need<00:00:49.860> to

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 
so now that we have this done we need to

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:51.740 
so now that we have this done we need to
take<00:00:50.190> and<00:00:50.370> change<00:00:50.610> where<00:00:50.820> the<00:00:51.000> pre<00:00:51.210> comp<00:00:51.480> layer

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
take and change where the pre comp layer

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:54.049 
take and change where the pre comp layer
rotates<00:00:52.289> around<00:00:52.739> so<00:00:53.399> I<00:00:53.430> will<00:00:53.610> go<00:00:53.760> up<00:00:53.789> and<00:00:53.969> grab

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
rotates around so I will go up and grab

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:56.150 
rotates around so I will go up and grab
my<00:00:54.270> pan<00:00:54.539> behind<00:00:54.960> tool<00:00:55.140> for<00:00:55.379> my<00:00:55.500> tool<00:00:55.770> bar<00:00:55.949> and

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.160 
my pan behind tool for my tool bar and

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:58.340 
my pan behind tool for my tool bar and
then<00:00:56.340> zoom<00:00:56.610> in<00:00:56.789> so<00:00:57.600> after<00:00:57.840> that<00:00:57.960> grab<00:00:58.199> the

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
then zoom in so after that grab the

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:00.049 
then zoom in so after that grab the
anchor<00:00:58.620> point<00:00:58.890> of<00:00:59.010> our<00:00:59.129> layer<00:00:59.370> and<00:00:59.609> then<00:00:59.879> take

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
anchor point of our layer and then take

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:01.639 
anchor point of our layer and then take
and<00:01:00.239> move<00:01:00.359> it<00:01:00.480> to<00:01:00.570> the<00:01:00.690> very<00:01:00.930> bottom<00:01:01.350> of<00:01:01.469> the

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:01.649 
and move it to the very bottom of the

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:03.380 
and move it to the very bottom of the
text<00:01:02.039> this<00:01:02.460> will<00:01:02.609> mean<00:01:02.699> that<00:01:02.879> our<00:01:02.969> text<00:01:03.210> will

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
text this will mean that our text will

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:06.050 
text this will mean that our text will
now<00:01:03.510> rotate<00:01:03.780> and<00:01:04.170> move<00:01:04.320> around<00:01:04.530> this<00:01:04.860> point<00:01:05.159> so

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
now rotate and move around this point so

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:07.039 
now rotate and move around this point so
after<00:01:06.270> that<00:01:06.390> we're<00:01:06.570> ready<00:01:06.750> to<00:01:06.869> start

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049 
after that we're ready to start

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:09.620 
after that we're ready to start
animating<00:01:07.560> so<00:01:08.159> go<00:01:08.310> ahead<00:01:08.430> and<00:01:08.580> check<00:01:09.060> the<00:01:09.240> 3d

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
animating so go ahead and check the 3d

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:12.050 
animating so go ahead and check the 3d
layer<00:01:09.869> box<00:01:10.140> for<00:01:10.530> your<00:01:10.680> pre<00:01:10.950> comp<00:01:11.220> and<00:01:11.430> press<00:01:11.820> R

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
layer box for your pre comp and press R

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:14.240 
layer box for your pre comp and press R
to<00:01:12.090> bring<00:01:12.390> up<00:01:12.510> the<00:01:12.659> rotation<00:01:12.990> keyframes<00:01:13.650> so<00:01:14.130> go

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
to bring up the rotation keyframes so go

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:16.160 
to bring up the rotation keyframes so go
ahead<00:01:14.369> and<00:01:14.670> click<00:01:14.880> the<00:01:15.030> stopwatch<00:01:15.330> for<00:01:15.570> the<00:01:16.020> X

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
ahead and click the stopwatch for the X

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:17.899 
ahead and click the stopwatch for the X
rotation<00:01:16.409> to<00:01:16.799> set<00:01:17.009> a<00:01:17.040> keyframe<00:01:17.250> for<00:01:17.520> that

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909 
rotation to set a keyframe for that

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:19.760 
rotation to set a keyframe for that
property<00:01:18.420> so<00:01:18.600> after<00:01:19.290> that<00:01:19.409> move<00:01:19.590> your

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
property so after that move your

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:21.080 
property so after that move your
playhead<00:01:19.979> out<00:01:20.250> to<00:01:20.430> about<00:01:20.580> a<00:01:20.640> third<00:01:20.909> of<00:01:21.000> a

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090 
playhead out to about a third of a

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:23.090 
playhead out to about a third of a
second<00:01:21.479> and<00:01:21.600> then<00:01:21.960> raise<00:01:22.200> up<00:01:22.500> the<00:01:22.650> X<00:01:22.860> rotation

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
second and then raise up the X rotation

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:25.520 
second and then raise up the X rotation
until<00:01:23.820> the<00:01:23.939> text<00:01:24.240> falls<00:01:24.540> forward<00:01:24.930> and<00:01:25.290> lays

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
until the text falls forward and lays

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:27.620 
until the text falls forward and lays
flat<00:01:25.830> on<00:01:25.890> the<00:01:26.159> ground<00:01:26.430> so<00:01:27.299> during<00:01:27.509> this

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
flat on the ground so during this

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:28.940 
flat on the ground so during this
animation<00:01:28.020> we're<00:01:28.259> also<00:01:28.409> going<00:01:28.650> to<00:01:28.710> want<00:01:28.890> to

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950 
animation we're also going to want to

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:30.770 
animation we're also going to want to
animate<00:01:29.310> the<00:01:29.430> opacity<00:01:29.460> so<00:01:30.180> go<00:01:30.329> ahead<00:01:30.540> and

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 
animate the opacity so go ahead and

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:32.539 
animate the opacity so go ahead and
press<00:01:30.990> shift<00:01:31.470> T<00:01:31.710> on<00:01:31.860> your<00:01:31.979> keyboard<00:01:32.040> to<00:01:32.460> bring

up<00:01:32.790> that<00:01:33.000> property<00:01:33.509> so<00:01:33.689> then<00:01:34.170> we<00:01:34.259> can<00:01:34.409> take<00:01:34.500> and

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
up that property so then we can take and

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:36.740 
up that property so then we can take and
animate<00:01:35.040> the<00:01:35.189> opacity<00:01:35.220> so<00:01:35.970> that<00:01:36.090> as<00:01:36.270> the<00:01:36.479> text

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750 
animate the opacity so that as the text

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:38.749 
animate the opacity so that as the text
gets<00:01:36.960> closer<00:01:37.229> to<00:01:37.350> the<00:01:37.500> ground<00:01:37.799> we<00:01:38.280> fade<00:01:38.460> it<00:01:38.610> out

00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:38.759 
gets closer to the ground we fade it out

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:41.780 
gets closer to the ground we fade it out
over<00:01:39.060> a<00:01:39.090> few<00:01:39.329> frames<00:01:40.130> so<00:01:41.130> there<00:01:41.280> we<00:01:41.400> go<00:01:41.430> now<00:01:41.549> we

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:41.790 
over a few frames so there we go now we

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:43.550 
over a few frames so there we go now we
have<00:01:42.000> the<00:01:42.150> first<00:01:42.420> piece<00:01:42.720> of<00:01:42.780> the<00:01:43.049> animation

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560 
have the first piece of the animation

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:45.499 
have the first piece of the animation
complete<00:01:43.979> now<00:01:44.490> for<00:01:44.670> the<00:01:44.759> second<00:01:45.090> piece<00:01:45.210> we<00:01:45.420> can

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:45.509 
complete now for the second piece we can

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:47.330 
complete now for the second piece we can
double<00:01:45.840> click<00:01:45.869> on<00:01:46.079> our<00:01:46.290> pre<00:01:46.680> comp<00:01:46.950> and<00:01:47.130> then

back to our main comp and paste it so

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:53.600 
back to our main comp and paste it so
I'll<00:01:52.200> then<00:01:52.380> change<00:01:52.680> this<00:01:52.860> text<00:01:53.100> to<00:01:53.340> a<00:01:53.369> blue

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:53.610 
I'll then change this text to a blue

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:55.700 
I'll then change this text to a blue
color<00:01:53.880> and<00:01:54.149> scale<00:01:54.509> it<00:01:54.659> up<00:01:54.780> now<00:01:55.350> I'm<00:01:55.439> also<00:01:55.590> going

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:55.710 
color and scale it up now I'm also going

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:57.319 
color and scale it up now I'm also going
to<00:01:55.890> be<00:01:56.040> changing<00:01:56.399> what<00:01:56.549> the<00:01:56.700> text<00:01:56.969> says<00:01:57.119> and

00:01:57.319 --> 00:01:57.329 
to be changing what the text says and

00:01:57.329 --> 00:01:59.660 
to be changing what the text says and
we're<00:01:57.420> going<00:01:57.630> to<00:01:57.659> make<00:01:57.780> it<00:01:57.930> say<00:01:58.110> on<00:01:58.460> so<00:01:59.460> you<00:01:59.549> can

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670 
we're going to make it say on so you can

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:01.100 
we're going to make it say on so you can
move<00:01:59.790> this<00:01:59.969> text<00:02:00.119> around<00:02:00.329> a<00:02:00.509> little<00:02:00.630> bit<00:02:00.899> but

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:01.110 
move this text around a little bit but

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:02.810 
move this text around a little bit but
make<00:02:01.320> sure<00:02:01.500> to<00:02:01.649> keep<00:02:01.799> this<00:02:01.979> text<00:02:02.340> on<00:02:02.430> the<00:02:02.610> same

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:02.820 
make sure to keep this text on the same

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:04.850 
make sure to keep this text on the same
x<00:02:03.090> axis<00:02:03.689> so<00:02:03.719> that<00:02:03.840> it<00:02:04.020> rotates<00:02:04.409> around<00:02:04.590> the

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:04.860 
x axis so that it rotates around the

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:06.920 
x axis so that it rotates around the
same<00:02:05.100> area<00:02:05.430> now<00:02:06.149> feel<00:02:06.360> free<00:02:06.420> to<00:02:06.630> move<00:02:06.780> it

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:06.930 
same area now feel free to move it

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:08.419 
same area now feel free to move it
horizontally<00:02:07.170> so<00:02:07.710> that<00:02:07.740> it<00:02:07.950> lines<00:02:08.129> up<00:02:08.369> with

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:08.429 
horizontally so that it lines up with

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:10.639 
horizontally so that it lines up with
the<00:02:08.670> previous<00:02:09.060> rotation<00:02:09.629> so<00:02:10.229> again<00:02:10.440> make<00:02:10.619> sure

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:10.649 
the previous rotation so again make sure

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:13.250 
the previous rotation so again make sure
and<00:02:11.039> turn<00:02:11.250> this<00:02:11.430> layer<00:02:11.640> into<00:02:12.000> a<00:02:12.030> 3d<00:02:12.510> layer<00:02:12.750> and

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:13.260 
and turn this layer into a 3d layer and

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:13.760 
and turn this layer into a 3d layer and
then<00:02:13.349> go<00:02:13.470> ahead

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:13.770 
then go ahead

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:15.080 
then go ahead
move<00:02:13.890> your<00:02:14.010> playhead<00:02:14.250> over<00:02:14.460> to<00:02:14.880> where<00:02:15.060> the

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:15.090 
move your playhead over to where the

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:17.300 
move your playhead over to where the
first<00:02:15.450> layer<00:02:15.780> started<00:02:16.230> to<00:02:16.320> rotate<00:02:16.530> and<00:02:16.920> then

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:17.310 
first layer started to rotate and then

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:19.220 
first layer started to rotate and then
set<00:02:17.490> an<00:02:17.610> extra<00:02:17.910> rotation<00:02:18.390> and<00:02:18.600> an<00:02:18.720> opacity

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:19.230 
set an extra rotation and an opacity

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:21.350 
set an extra rotation and an opacity
keyframe<00:02:19.530> so<00:02:20.460> after<00:02:20.700> that<00:02:20.820> you<00:02:20.880> can<00:02:21.120> go<00:02:21.150> ahead

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:21.360 
keyframe so after that you can go ahead

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:22.700 
keyframe so after that you can go ahead
and<00:02:21.480> move<00:02:21.630> the<00:02:21.750> playhead<00:02:21.990> to<00:02:22.170> where<00:02:22.380> the<00:02:22.500> first

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:22.710 
and move the playhead to where the first

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:24.560 
and move the playhead to where the first
layer<00:02:23.010> had<00:02:23.220> faded<00:02:23.430> out<00:02:23.760> and<00:02:24.030> set<00:02:24.330> two<00:02:24.540> more

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:24.570 
layer had faded out and set two more

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:26.810 
layer had faded out and set two more
keyframes<00:02:24.960> so<00:02:25.500> once<00:02:26.070> you've<00:02:26.190> done<00:02:26.340> this<00:02:26.520> go

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:26.820 
keyframes so once you've done this go

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:28.700 
keyframes so once you've done this go
back<00:02:26.970> to<00:02:27.180> your<00:02:27.330> first<00:02:27.630> X<00:02:27.900> rotation<00:02:28.200> keyframe

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:28.710 
back to your first X rotation keyframe

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:30.710 
back to your first X rotation keyframe
and<00:02:29.190> lower<00:02:29.370> the<00:02:29.610> value<00:02:29.760> so<00:02:30.150> that<00:02:30.270> the<00:02:30.420> text

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:30.720 
and lower the value so that the text

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:33.620 
and lower the value so that the text
rotates<00:02:31.200> downward<00:02:31.770> to<00:02:32.190> lay<00:02:32.340> on<00:02:32.460> its<00:02:32.640> back<00:02:32.880> now

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:33.630 
rotates downward to lay on its back now

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:35.510 
rotates downward to lay on its back now
again<00:02:33.870> we<00:02:34.020> want<00:02:34.230> the<00:02:34.290> text<00:02:34.530> to<00:02:34.710> fade<00:02:34.920> in<00:02:35.100> so<00:02:35.370> go

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:35.520 
again we want the text to fade in so go

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:36.950 
again we want the text to fade in so go
ahead<00:02:35.610> and<00:02:35.760> set<00:02:36.030> your<00:02:36.060> first<00:02:36.450> keyframe<00:02:36.690> to

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:36.960 
ahead and set your first keyframe to

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:38.720 
ahead and set your first keyframe to
zero<00:02:37.380> and<00:02:37.830> then<00:02:37.950> move<00:02:38.070> the<00:02:38.190> second<00:02:38.550> keyframe

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:38.730 
zero and then move the second keyframe

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:41.330 
zero and then move the second keyframe
in<00:02:39.150> so<00:02:39.420> that<00:02:39.570> the<00:02:39.690> text<00:02:39.990> fades<00:02:40.170> in<00:02:40.380> quickly<00:02:40.800> so

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:41.340 
in so that the text fades in quickly so

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:43.070 
in so that the text fades in quickly so
now<00:02:41.460> we<00:02:41.520> have<00:02:41.700> the<00:02:41.820> text<00:02:42.120> animating<00:02:42.660> in<00:02:42.840> and

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:43.080 
now we have the text animating in and

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:44.480 
now we have the text animating in and
since<00:02:43.380> we<00:02:43.500> want<00:02:43.710> the<00:02:43.830> text<00:02:44.100> to<00:02:44.160> stay<00:02:44.370> around

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:44.490 
since we want the text to stay around

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:46.700 
since we want the text to stay around
for<00:02:44.910> a<00:02:44.940> little<00:02:45.030> bit<00:02:45.180> on<00:02:45.300> this<00:02:45.600> second<00:02:45.990> piece<00:02:46.230> we

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:46.710 
for a little bit on this second piece we

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:48.260 
for a little bit on this second piece we
can<00:02:46.890> take<00:02:47.040> and<00:02:47.220> move<00:02:47.340> the<00:02:47.460> playhead<00:02:47.670> out<00:02:47.970> about

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:48.270 
can take and move the playhead out about

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:50.300 
can take and move the playhead out about
another<00:02:48.540> 3/4<00:02:49.170> of<00:02:49.290> a<00:02:49.410> second<00:02:49.800> and<00:02:49.920> create<00:02:50.280> a

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:50.310 
another 3/4 of a second and create a

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:52.280 
another 3/4 of a second and create a
next<00:02:50.670> rotation<00:02:51.090> keyframe<00:02:51.300> and<00:02:51.720> an<00:02:51.780> opacity

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:52.290 
next rotation keyframe and an opacity

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:54.560 
next rotation keyframe and an opacity
keyframe<00:02:52.500> so<00:02:52.940> after<00:02:53.940> you're<00:02:54.090> happy<00:02:54.330> with<00:02:54.420> the

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:54.570 
keyframe so after you're happy with the

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:56.090 
keyframe so after you're happy with the
timing<00:02:54.930> on<00:02:55.050> that<00:02:55.200> you<00:02:55.350> can<00:02:55.500> move<00:02:55.650> out<00:02:55.800> another

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:56.100 
timing on that you can move out another

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:58.160 
timing on that you can move out another
third<00:02:56.550> of<00:02:56.670> a<00:02:56.730> second<00:02:57.090> or<00:02:57.210> so<00:02:57.390> and<00:02:57.600> then<00:02:57.960> create

00:02:58.160 --> 00:02:58.170 
third of a second or so and then create

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:00.290 
third of a second or so and then create
another<00:02:58.410> X<00:02:58.650> rotation<00:02:59.220> keyframe<00:02:59.460> as<00:02:59.910> well<00:03:00.150> as

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:00.300 
another X rotation keyframe as well as

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:02.390 
another X rotation keyframe as well as
an<00:03:00.390> opacity<00:03:00.930> keyframe<00:03:01.170> so<00:03:01.890> then<00:03:02.040> again<00:03:02.220> we're

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:02.400 
an opacity keyframe so then again we're

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:04.160 
an opacity keyframe so then again we're
going<00:03:02.550> to<00:03:02.640> adjust<00:03:02.910> the<00:03:03.090> value<00:03:03.390> of<00:03:03.570> the<00:03:03.660> last<00:03:03.870> X

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:04.170 
going to adjust the value of the last X

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:06.200 
going to adjust the value of the last X
rotation<00:03:04.650> keyframe<00:03:04.830> so<00:03:05.100> the<00:03:05.460> text<00:03:05.760> then<00:03:05.940> falls

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:06.210 
rotation keyframe so the text then falls

00:03:06.210 --> 00:03:08.420 
rotation keyframe so the text then falls
forward<00:03:06.600> so<00:03:07.500> then<00:03:07.620> we're<00:03:07.710> also<00:03:07.830> going<00:03:08.100> to<00:03:08.250> take

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:08.430 
forward so then we're also going to take

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:10.430 
forward so then we're also going to take
the<00:03:08.550> last<00:03:08.730> opacity<00:03:09.420> keyframe<00:03:09.600> and<00:03:10.050> make<00:03:10.200> that

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:10.440 
the last opacity keyframe and make that

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:12.650 
the last opacity keyframe and make that
zero<00:03:10.830> and<00:03:11.100> adjust<00:03:11.670> the<00:03:11.760> opacity<00:03:12.000> keyframe<00:03:12.420> so

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:12.660 
zero and adjust the opacity keyframe so

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:15.230 
zero and adjust the opacity keyframe so
the<00:03:13.020> text<00:03:13.290> fades<00:03:13.470> out<00:03:13.710> as<00:03:13.890> it<00:03:14.190> falls<00:03:14.430> so<00:03:15.150> the

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:15.240 
the text fades out as it falls so the

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:16.640 
the text fades out as it falls so the
steps<00:03:15.480> for<00:03:15.600> the<00:03:15.720> third<00:03:15.900> and<00:03:16.050> final<00:03:16.170> piece<00:03:16.470> are

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:16.650 
steps for the third and final piece are

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:18.170 
steps for the third and final piece are
very<00:03:16.860> similar<00:03:17.130> to<00:03:17.280> the<00:03:17.430> beginning<00:03:17.790> of<00:03:17.970> the

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:18.180 
very similar to the beginning of the

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:20.480 
very similar to the beginning of the
second<00:03:18.600> piece<00:03:18.750> so<00:03:19.320> first<00:03:19.560> go<00:03:19.770> ahead<00:03:19.860> and<00:03:20.190> copy

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:20.490 
second piece so first go ahead and copy

00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:22.580 
second piece so first go ahead and copy
the<00:03:20.880> text<00:03:20.910> from<00:03:21.240> the<00:03:21.480> inside<00:03:21.990> of<00:03:22.200> the<00:03:22.290> first

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:22.590 
the text from the inside of the first

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:26.620 
the text from the inside of the first
pre-comp<00:03:23.250> and<00:03:23.340> paste<00:03:23.760> a<00:03:23.910> copy<00:03:23.940> on<00:03:24.450> the<00:03:24.660> stage

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:26.630 
pre-comp and paste a copy on the stage

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:28.630 
pre-comp and paste a copy on the stage
I<00:03:26.690> will<00:03:27.410> then<00:03:27.500> change<00:03:27.680> the<00:03:27.920> text<00:03:28.280> and<00:03:28.400> then<00:03:28.610> go

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:28.640 
I will then change the text and then go

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:30.670 
I will then change the text and then go
ahead<00:03:28.850> and<00:03:29.150> duplicate<00:03:29.630> this<00:03:29.780> layer<00:03:29.840> again<00:03:30.110> and

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:30.680 
ahead and duplicate this layer again and

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:32.890 
ahead and duplicate this layer again and
then<00:03:31.040> change<00:03:31.280> that<00:03:31.520> text<00:03:31.760> so<00:03:32.480> after<00:03:32.690> that<00:03:32.780> I

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:32.900 
then change that text so after that I

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:34.330 
then change that text so after that I
can<00:03:33.050> scale<00:03:33.320> up<00:03:33.350> the<00:03:33.590> pieces<00:03:33.920> of<00:03:34.040> text

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:34.340 
can scale up the pieces of text

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:36.100 
can scale up the pieces of text
accordingly<00:03:34.790> and<00:03:35.090> then<00:03:35.420> make<00:03:35.570> the<00:03:35.720> top<00:03:35.900> word

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:36.110 
accordingly and then make the top word

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:38.740 
accordingly and then make the top word
white<00:03:36.380> and<00:03:36.650> the<00:03:36.740> bottom<00:03:37.040> one<00:03:37.220> red<00:03:37.600> so<00:03:38.600> while

00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:38.750 
white and the bottom one red so while

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:40.090 
white and the bottom one red so while
you're<00:03:38.900> doing<00:03:39.140> this<00:03:39.230> don't<00:03:39.440> forget<00:03:39.590> to<00:03:39.740> scrub

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:40.100 
you're doing this don't forget to scrub

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:41.680 
you're doing this don't forget to scrub
in<00:03:40.280> to<00:03:40.400> where<00:03:40.550> the<00:03:40.670> pieces<00:03:40.880> overlap<00:03:41.210> with<00:03:41.570> the

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:41.690 
in to where the pieces overlap with the

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:43.180 
in to where the pieces overlap with the
second<00:03:42.080> piece<00:03:42.260> in<00:03:42.620> order<00:03:42.770> to<00:03:42.920> make<00:03:43.040> sure<00:03:43.070> that

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:43.190 
second piece in order to make sure that

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:45.559 
second piece in order to make sure that
they<00:03:43.400> are<00:03:43.490> centered<00:03:43.820> up<00:03:43.970> correctly

00:03:45.559 --> 00:03:45.569 
they are centered up correctly

00:03:45.569 --> 00:03:47.479 
they are centered up correctly
so<00:03:46.230> since<00:03:46.439> again<00:03:46.650> we're<00:03:46.799> using<00:03:46.829> two<00:03:47.310> layers

00:03:47.479 --> 00:03:47.489 
so since again we're using two layers

00:03:47.489 --> 00:03:49.309 
so since again we're using two layers
make<00:03:47.819> sure<00:03:48.000> in<00:03:48.180> pre-comp<00:03:48.719> these<00:03:48.930> and<00:03:49.170> then

00:03:49.309 --> 00:03:49.319 
make sure in pre-comp these and then

00:03:49.319 --> 00:03:50.990 
make sure in pre-comp these and then
zoom<00:03:49.530> in<00:03:49.680> to<00:03:49.890> move<00:03:50.040> the<00:03:50.159> anchor<00:03:50.459> point<00:03:50.730> to<00:03:50.879> the

00:03:50.990 --> 00:03:51.000 
zoom in to move the anchor point to the

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:52.429 
zoom in to move the anchor point to the
bottom<00:03:51.299> of<00:03:51.359> the<00:03:51.480> text<00:03:51.810> with<00:03:51.959> the<00:03:51.989> Pan<00:03:52.260> behind

00:03:52.429 --> 00:03:52.439 
bottom of the text with the Pan behind

00:03:52.439 --> 00:04:00.830 
bottom of the text with the Pan behind
tool

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:00.840 

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:02.690 

now<00:04:01.319> after<00:04:01.440> that<00:04:01.709> it's<00:04:01.890> as<00:04:02.040> easy<00:04:02.220> as<00:04:02.489> turning

00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:02.700 
now after that it's as easy as turning

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:04.699 
now after that it's as easy as turning
the<00:04:02.970> layer<00:04:03.150> into<00:04:03.480> a<00:04:03.510> 3d<00:04:04.020> layer<00:04:04.230> and<00:04:04.500> then

00:04:04.699 --> 00:04:04.709 
the layer into a 3d layer and then

00:04:04.709 --> 00:04:06.860 
the layer into a 3d layer and then
animating<00:04:05.250> the<00:04:05.370> text<00:04:05.640> upward<00:04:06.060> and<00:04:06.300> fading<00:04:06.750> it

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:06.870 
animating the text upward and fading it

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:08.510 
animating the text upward and fading it
in<00:04:07.020> now<00:04:07.560> I'm<00:04:07.650> not<00:04:07.800> going<00:04:07.980> to<00:04:08.040> spend<00:04:08.220> a<00:04:08.280> lot<00:04:08.400> of

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:08.520 
in now I'm not going to spend a lot of

00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:10.250 
in now I'm not going to spend a lot of
time<00:04:08.670> covering<00:04:08.880> this<00:04:09.209> key<00:04:09.450> four<00:04:09.690> key<00:04:09.870> as<00:04:10.110> we

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:10.260 
time covering this key four key as we

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:11.750 
time covering this key four key as we
have<00:04:10.410> discussed<00:04:10.830> a<00:04:10.920> lot<00:04:11.040> of<00:04:11.099> these<00:04:11.280> concepts

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:11.760 
have discussed a lot of these concepts

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:14.600 
have discussed a lot of these concepts
and<00:04:11.970> the<00:04:12.030> other<00:04:12.209> two<00:04:12.450> pieces

00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:14.610 
and the other two pieces

00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:16.250 
and the other two pieces
so<00:04:15.270> now<00:04:15.360> when<00:04:15.570> you're<00:04:15.690> finished<00:04:16.019> you<00:04:16.110> can<00:04:16.170> go

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:16.260 
so now when you're finished you can go

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:17.900 
so now when you're finished you can go
ahead<00:04:16.470> and<00:04:16.590> throw<00:04:16.950> a<00:04:17.010> few<00:04:17.250> finishing<00:04:17.459> touches

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:17.910 
ahead and throw a few finishing touches

00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:19.759 
ahead and throw a few finishing touches
