00:00:00.760 --> 00:00:03.270
 ah 

00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:08.120
 well we are in a new video of 

00:00:06.559 --> 00:00:10.370
 Naruto Shippuden Ultimate Ninja Storm 

00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:12.080
 revolution we are in a game 

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:16.369
 multiplayer I've finally been able to play 

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:17.930
 online in the super demo or basically 

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:20.350
 I just have to have patience and so 

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:23.250
 Well, you can play 

00:00:20.350 --> 00:00:23.250
 then in the whore 

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:28.579
 but not me 

00:00:29.850 --> 00:00:34.990
 you are given out for friends 

00:00:32.419 --> 00:00:36.970
 they are out the trunks 

00:00:34.990 --> 00:00:39.040
 well that what he said basically 

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:41.740
 we can play online with the demo because 

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:43.950
 we will start a new section we could 

00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:47.680
 say multiplayer games to which 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:50.080
 this water gets into every beating in this 

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:54.510
 game that they support before a million 

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:54.510
 but so the ipyc nes 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:58.790
 so good will be what you can more 

00:00:56.970 --> 00:01:02.239
 of filming history surely but 

00:00:58.790 --> 00:01:02.239
 fun above all 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:05.510
 First 

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:14.950
 OK 

00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:17.710
 good question, I do not know if there is someone 

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:20.330
 that is following the series will give many 

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:22.130
 thanks for both spoiler but good 

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:23.960
 basically put of our videos 

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:27.530
 under your responsibility is the law 

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:29.630
 that are going to see you are going to have things that 

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:31.690
 they are right now in what is the series 

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:33.700
 of the sleeve with which 

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:35.530
 is what there is if you do not follow the series of 

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:38.010
 day possibly by his many theory 

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:38.010
 doors 

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:44.740
 we go 

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:48.119
 not much else fought more the shamans have 

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:48.119
 stayed the triangle and then the X 

00:01:51.909 --> 00:01:57.780
 is that I can not talk while I play 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:57.780
 It's a fucking shit 

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:05.970
 the wells 

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:11.950
 no no 

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:19.829
 12 

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:22.850
 and now 

00:02:19.829 --> 00:02:25.370
 I tried to jump, I think 

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:27.440
 good resigned team fly a little good 

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:29.570
 basically that changes a lot of things 

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:32.270
 about it during the games there 

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:35.240
 several modalities of people that stops 

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:37.220
 choose one that has the awakening one 

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:38.840
 that does not have it is the one that does not have it 

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:41.960
 excessively in awakening the other is 

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:44.480
 that he has another is basically without 

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:45.740
 special attack we could say it does 

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:48.020
 something else 

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:50.000
 many very many moves 

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:52.880
 different things that as I say then 

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:55.130
 try to dominate as soon as possible to see if 

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:57.440
 I have time for it is that I am a 

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:58.760
 pretty busy person here and I'm going 

00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:00.650
 uploading everything because they can continue 

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:04.310
 until next time 

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:06.079
 well this is a new fight of fuck 

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:09.140
 Naruto Shippuden Ultimate Ninja Storm 

00:03:06.079 --> 00:03:11.710
 revolution in the whore to say all the 

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:14.820
 name if the territory lands the villa 

00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:14.820
 I can die 

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:26.790
 well I'm the one with the rare account prt cgh h 

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:28.650
 we 're hitting a whore 

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:29.960
 beating the same does not have a 

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:33.320
 due goodbye 

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:36.370

00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:36.370

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:45.879
 Oh my God 

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:45.879
 Oh my God 

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:50.620
 I do not have anything at all 

00:03:51.460 --> 00:03:54.850
 of the handsome 

00:03:55.110 --> 00:04:00.370
 Uncle is humiliating me this character 

00:03:57.590 --> 00:04:05.099
 I was humiliating 

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:05.099
 this was at the final level the previous vague 

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:12.130
 Y 

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:12.130
 host uncle 

00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:22.040
 leaves humiliated but we're going so 

00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:25.190
 amazing is water I feel stupid or 

00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:28.090
 dirty and disgusting do not see the beating that 

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:28.090
 He has me next 

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:33.800
 in this demo there is already a lot of level already 

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:33.800
 he saw 

00:04:34.129 --> 00:04:41.439
 they want to break the most eyes and 

00:04:37.849 --> 00:04:41.439
 anger and stuck a beating 

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:46.110
 well here we are in a game of 

00:04:43.970 --> 00:04:48.600
 Naruto Shippuden Ultimate Ninja Storm 

00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:54.570
 revolution and one the truth that they are 

00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:58.860
 getting many beatings I go like 99 to 29 

00:04:54.570 --> 00:05:01.920
 I do not know there are no losses already and one or two or 

00:04:58.860 --> 00:05:04.480
 three victories get me every beating 

00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:07.470
 that the little bit 

00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:07.470
 with the state 

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:12.220
 they do not know the name uncle with kaka 

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:18.740
 let's do 

00:05:15.740 --> 00:05:22.220
 this is not that it's very good so 

00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:23.960
 it looks is an opportunity although it has 

00:05:22.220 --> 00:05:26.199
 more victories than this man be the 

00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:26.199
 father 

00:05:26.210 --> 00:05:31.969
 no no 

00:05:28.390 --> 00:05:36.799
 we can not help you recover 

00:05:31.969 --> 00:05:38.689
 you see god and you've seen that 

00:05:36.799 --> 00:05:39.889
 does with the r2 and the square that's the 

00:05:38.689 --> 00:05:42.199
 stun who is talking in the 

00:05:39.889 --> 00:05:43.669
 previous video if we do it well what 

00:05:42.199 --> 00:05:46.869
 we were doing and we can put in special 

00:05:43.669 --> 00:05:50.360
 basically this 

00:05:46.869 --> 00:05:52.189
 we could say but not state pgje 

00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:53.959
 because if we fail if we do not 

00:05:52.189 --> 00:05:55.309
 ok we can get the special and go 

00:05:53.959 --> 00:05:56.419
 to make love to talk to us though 

00:05:55.309 --> 00:06:01.509
 has not tried to see if you can be a 

00:05:56.419 --> 00:06:01.509
 trunk when it fails 

00:06:02.460 --> 00:06:08.250
 but I could not use a trunk basically 

00:06:05.580 --> 00:06:10.169
 although not in particular I imagine that 

00:06:08.250 --> 00:06:11.659
 the first the first blow that you get 

00:06:10.169 --> 00:06:15.090
 good 

00:06:11.659 --> 00:06:18.969
 I do not know how to hold on I do not remember now 

00:06:15.090 --> 00:06:21.579
 a lot of 2 and 4 

00:06:18.969 --> 00:06:26.069
 it is not asked below I remember then the 

00:06:21.579 --> 00:06:26.069
 the probable new desire at the end 

00:06:27.360 --> 00:06:30.590
 give me your life 

00:06:30.600 --> 00:06:35.490
 good are fertilizer 

00:06:32.790 --> 00:06:37.800
 it's over for what you're liking 

00:06:35.490 --> 00:06:39.590
 much at stake despite the losses I 

00:06:37.800 --> 00:06:41.670
 I think this is better than the last 

00:06:39.590 --> 00:06:43.830
 since it has with chairs like the one 

00:06:41.670 --> 00:06:45.120
 you've seen this stun and such 

00:06:43.830 --> 00:06:46.800
 they make it a bit more technical, not what 

00:06:45.120 --> 00:06:49.080
 limit what the trunks are in 

00:06:46.800 --> 00:06:51.690
 what is defense is the improvement 

00:06:49.080 --> 00:06:53.580
 quite and there are many more things like 

00:06:51.690 --> 00:06:54.810
 I'll have to beat him in time 

00:06:53.580 --> 00:06:56.550
 game to go trying different 

00:06:54.810 --> 00:06:58.860
 you get to know what is the best 

00:06:56.550 --> 00:07:02.190
 but for now I like this tactic more 

00:06:58.860 --> 00:07:07.460
 that beats more truth so nothing else 

00:07:02.190 --> 00:07:07.460
 let's go in the next next fight
