 two days more exploited 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:49.110
 but on a modest job hike because all the yellow birch leaves 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:50.910

 I forgive debuchy but also landmarks on masson 

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:04.330
 we can go hunting for natural disturbances such as 

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:06.140
 outbreaks 

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:09.140

 it takes 500 wounded 

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:19.280
 same thing if the idea to know a lot of barriers 

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:21.230
 so here we had 

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:23.680
 who was surrounded by women 

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:26.820

00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:35.470
