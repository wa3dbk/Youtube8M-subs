so<00:00:15.299> you<00:00:15.360> mentioned<00:00:15.900> it<00:00:16.199> just<00:00:16.379> I'm<00:00:16.500> going<00:00:16.619> to<00:00:16.680> go

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:16.770 
so you mentioned it just I'm going to go

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:18.590 
so you mentioned it just I'm going to go
to<00:00:16.830> Sheba's<00:00:17.279> cell<00:00:17.580> TV<00:00:18.000> it's<00:00:18.210> the<00:00:18.390> Cell

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:18.600 
to Sheba's cell TV it's the Cell

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:21.140 
to Sheba's cell TV it's the Cell
processor<00:00:18.630> it's<00:00:19.380> a<00:00:19.500> TV<00:00:19.890> why<00:00:20.490> what's<00:00:20.910> the<00:00:20.970> cell

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:21.150 
processor it's a TV why what's the cell

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:23.420 
processor it's a TV why what's the cell
prob<00:00:21.359> what's<00:00:21.689> a<00:00:21.779> ps3<00:00:22.080> process<00:00:22.740> are<00:00:22.830> doing<00:00:23.070> in<00:00:23.340> a

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:23.430 
prob what's a ps3 process are doing in a

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:25.310 
prob what's a ps3 process are doing in a
toshiba<00:00:23.910> HDTV<00:00:24.269> well<00:00:24.900> the<00:00:25.109> Cell<00:00:25.289> processor

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:25.320 
toshiba HDTV well the Cell processor

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:27.320 
toshiba HDTV well the Cell processor
that<00:00:25.800> powers<00:00:26.099> the<00:00:26.189> ps3<00:00:26.609> was<00:00:26.760> co-developed<00:00:27.060> by

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:27.330 
that powers the ps3 was co-developed by

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:31.009 
that powers the ps3 was co-developed by
IBM<00:00:28.140> Toshiba<00:00:28.920> and<00:00:29.070> Sony<00:00:29.460> so<00:00:30.000> it's<00:00:30.539> about<00:00:30.750> time

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:31.019 
IBM Toshiba and Sony so it's about time

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:32.269 
IBM Toshiba and Sony so it's about time
they<00:00:31.199> actually<00:00:31.470> put<00:00:31.590> this<00:00:31.619> to<00:00:31.859> work<00:00:32.040> I<00:00:32.160> mean

00:00:32.269 --> 00:00:32.279 
they actually put this to work I mean

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:34.250 
they actually put this to work I mean
you<00:00:32.369> can<00:00:32.460> buy<00:00:32.579> a<00:00:32.610> blade<00:00:32.820> server<00:00:33.090> from<00:00:33.270> IBM<00:00:33.690> but

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:34.260 
you can buy a blade server from IBM but

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:36.110 
you can buy a blade server from IBM but
putting<00:00:35.010> it<00:00:35.160> in<00:00:35.250> a<00:00:35.309> TV<00:00:35.489> last<00:00:35.790> year<00:00:35.969> they

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:36.120 
putting it in a TV last year they

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:38.030 
putting it in a TV last year they
demonstrated<00:00:36.600> this<00:00:36.719> as<00:00:36.870> a<00:00:36.899> prototype<00:00:37.200> doing

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.040 
demonstrated this as a prototype doing

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:40.280 
demonstrated this as a prototype doing
say<00:00:38.370> eight<00:00:38.610> HD<00:00:38.969> streams<00:00:39.480> at<00:00:39.629> once<00:00:39.809> all<00:00:40.050> being

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:40.290 
say eight HD streams at once all being

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:41.569 
say eight HD streams at once all being
decoded<00:00:40.590> using<00:00:41.040> the<00:00:41.129> power<00:00:41.280> of<00:00:41.399> that

00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:41.579 
decoded using the power of that

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:43.160 
decoded using the power of that
processor<00:00:42.059> they're<00:00:42.660> going<00:00:42.780> to<00:00:42.840> use<00:00:42.870> it<00:00:43.140> for

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:43.170 
processor they're going to use it for

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:45.260 
processor they're going to use it for
things<00:00:43.410> like<00:00:43.559> 2d<00:00:44.010> to<00:00:44.129> 3d<00:00:44.160> conversion<00:00:44.489> they're

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:45.270 
things like 2d to 3d conversion they're

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:46.520 
things like 2d to 3d conversion they're
also<00:00:45.420> going<00:00:45.539> to<00:00:45.600> use<00:00:45.719> it<00:00:45.870> for<00:00:45.899> up-conversion

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
also going to use it for up-conversion

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:48.229 
also going to use it for up-conversion
cleaning<00:00:47.250> the<00:00:47.340> video<00:00:47.579> there<00:00:47.850> is<00:00:47.879> going<00:00:48.090> to

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239 
cleaning the video there is going to

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:49.100 
cleaning the video there is going to
take<00:00:48.329> advantage<00:00:48.510> of<00:00:48.719> something<00:00:49.020> that's

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110 
take advantage of something that's

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:51.290 
take advantage of something that's
roughly<00:00:49.770> they're<00:00:49.980> claiming<00:00:50.160> 140<00:00:50.910> times<00:00:51.090> more

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 
roughly they're claiming 140 times more

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:53.990 
roughly they're claiming 140 times more
powerful<00:00:51.600> than<00:00:51.750> any<00:00:51.960> other<00:00:52.170> cpu<00:00:53.039> and<00:00:53.340> a<00:00:53.399> TV<00:00:53.760> and

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 
powerful than any other cpu and a TV and

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.240 
powerful than any other cpu and a TV and
using<00:00:54.870> that<00:00:54.899> to<00:00:55.020> make<00:00:55.199> better<00:00:55.649> features<00:00:55.920> and

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
using that to make better features and

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:57.979 
using that to make better features and
better<00:00:56.370> performance<00:00:56.940> out<00:00:57.030> of<00:00:57.090> it<00:00:57.239> other

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989 
better performance out of it other

00:00:57.989 --> 00:00:59.150 
better performance out of it other
things<00:00:58.199> I<00:00:58.350> liked<00:00:58.559> about<00:00:58.620> that<00:00:58.920> particular

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 
things I liked about that particular

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:00.410 
things I liked about that particular

bright as any other dissenters that is
really<00:01:08.760> really<00:01:08.790> bright<00:01:09.180> that's<00:01:09.450> just<00:01:09.600> it

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750 
really really bright that's just it

backlit LED backlight system it's not an

it<00:01:18.150> would<00:01:18.240> be<00:01:18.330> fairly<00:01:18.540> thin<00:01:18.810> it<00:01:18.930> being<00:01:19.080> under

an inch thick but it's going to have

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.179 
an inch thick but it's going to have
