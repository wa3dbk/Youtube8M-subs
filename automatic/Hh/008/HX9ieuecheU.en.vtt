spliced into the hot and neutral wire of
the<00:01:58.969> auxiliary<00:01:59.969> port<00:02:00.390> and<00:02:00.740> that's<00:02:01.740> what<00:02:01.950> feeds

00:02:02.209 --> 00:02:02.219 
the auxiliary port and that's what feeds

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:04.670 
the auxiliary port and that's what feeds
my<00:02:02.340> switch<00:02:02.790> and<00:02:03.060> what<00:02:03.210> feeds<00:02:03.509> my<00:02:03.689> inner<00:02:04.380> edge

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:04.680 
my switch and what feeds my inner edge

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:06.950 
my switch and what feeds my inner edge
light<00:02:04.979> up<00:02:05.310> here<00:02:05.579> so<00:02:06.299> I'm<00:02:06.360> going<00:02:06.540> to<00:02:06.570> turn<00:02:06.780> that
