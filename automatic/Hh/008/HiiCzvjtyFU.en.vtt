 Nowadays we give a play 

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:55.880
 only it was installed correctly 

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:58.940
 you see this 

00:02:55.880 --> 00:03:03.020
 from here on down it will be 

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:04.610
 written opte fine one point 7.10 hd 

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:08.270
 get here to see if it's working 

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:12.290
 correctly is I use texture for the 

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:16.340
 minecraft because I'd rather use it for 

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:18.920
 see and test whether it will crash or 

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:22.160
 will not lock up from opti 

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:25.690
 fine touch he was wearing 

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:31.130
 correctly if you come and give a sc 

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:32.120
 life options now in 

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:35.120
 video 

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:41.049
 it has several other options here op 

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:43.880
 advanced gl and this you can come here is 

00:03:41.049 --> 00:03:47.320
 in my case it was not necessary 

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:50.030
 update or modify any boy 

00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:53.510
 because he has already picked up the automatic 

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:56.330
 also set the video card and 

00:03:53.510 --> 00:04:00.680
 he saw the amount that is bearable 

00:03:56.330 --> 00:04:02.450
 so that minecraft can quietly 

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:05.600
 it is running very high graph 

00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:08.030
 here in the case beautiful graphics and here 

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:10.910
 look smooth nation and leave off by 

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:13.760
 while but I can activate it at most 

00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:16.010
 and here I can leave it at 100 per 

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:19.910
 one hundred or less 

00:04:16.010 --> 00:04:24.380
 brightness usually left 90% up 

00:04:19.910 --> 00:04:26.240
 they turned out to finish here ok he is 

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:29.030
 running quietly 

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:31.580
 remembering that minecraft for sure 

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:34.490
 one hour or another it will give a 

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:38.660
 You're there, there's no way 

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:42.500
 it be a system run a program a 

00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:44.540
 game played in java java generally 

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:48.260
 usually happens when you are 

00:04:44.540 --> 00:04:50.780
 're close to lava in other things 

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:54.140
 That's the way we ended up doing a 

00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:57.080
 optical and fine video to your mini 

00:04:54.140 --> 00:05:02.750
 crash run more smoothly without leg 

00:04:57.080 --> 00:05:06.740
 and softer with textures for your mini 

00:05:02.750 --> 00:05:09.290
