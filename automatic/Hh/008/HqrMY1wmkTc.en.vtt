but you want to get the oil at the right
temperature<00:00:52.980> too<00:00:53.160> hot<00:00:53.430> and<00:00:53.550> it<00:00:53.610> will<00:00:53.699> curl<00:00:53.910> up

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
temperature too hot and it will curl up

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:58.040 
temperature too hot and it will curl up
like<00:00:54.090> a<00:00:54.239> fist<00:00:54.920> too<00:00:55.920> cold<00:00:56.579> and<00:00:56.940> it<00:00:57.600> won't<00:00:57.899> cook

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.050 
like a fist too cold and it won't cook

00:00:58.050 --> 00:00:59.660 
like a fist too cold and it won't cook
thoroughly<00:00:58.379> and<00:00:58.739> they'll<00:00:58.829> end<00:00:58.949> up<00:00:59.039> all<00:00:59.219> bubbly

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
thoroughly and they'll end up all bubbly

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:03.799 
thoroughly and they'll end up all bubbly
and<00:01:00.109> not<00:01:01.109> very<00:01:01.230> nice<00:01:01.500> at<00:01:01.680> all<00:01:01.829> so<00:01:02.670> I<00:01:03.030> recommend

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:03.809 
and not very nice at all so I recommend

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:07.490 
and not very nice at all so I recommend
getting<00:01:03.870> your<00:01:04.080> oil<00:01:04.170> to<00:01:04.439> about<00:01:04.619> 200<00:01:05.430> and<00:01:06.110> I<00:01:07.110> love

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
getting your oil to about 200 and I love

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:09.200 
getting your oil to about 200 and I love
the<00:01:07.590> fat<00:01:07.799> fryer<00:01:08.040> obviously<00:01:08.340> we<00:01:08.430> can<00:01:08.580> set<00:01:08.850> it<00:01:09.030> at

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
the fat fryer obviously we can set it at

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:11.359 
the fat fryer obviously we can set it at
that<00:01:09.450> which<00:01:10.020> makes<00:01:10.260> our<00:01:10.380> job<00:01:10.590> a<00:01:10.619> bit<00:01:10.830> easier<00:01:10.950> so

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:11.369 
that which makes our job a bit easier so

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:14.690 
that which makes our job a bit easier so
you<00:01:12.060> want<00:01:12.450> to<00:01:12.570> sort<00:01:12.780> of<00:01:12.869> get<00:01:13.380> if<00:01:14.220> you<00:01:14.400> can't<00:01:14.580> get

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
you want to sort of get if you can't get

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:16.219 
you want to sort of get if you can't get
one<00:01:14.790> of<00:01:14.850> those<00:01:14.939> little<00:01:15.030> probes<00:01:15.390> just<00:01:15.750> to<00:01:15.840> set

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229 
one of those little probes just to set

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:19.370 
one of those little probes just to set
the<00:01:16.259> temperature<00:01:16.710> and<00:01:17.189> do<00:01:18.150> a<00:01:18.180> test<00:01:18.600> that's

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
the temperature and do a test that's

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:20.840 
the temperature and do a test that's
what<00:01:19.560> I<00:01:19.590> recommend<00:01:20.009> you<00:01:20.040> do<00:01:20.159> get<00:01:20.369> the<00:01:20.490> oil<00:01:20.610> to

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
what I recommend you do get the oil to

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:22.609 
what I recommend you do get the oil to
where<00:01:21.000> you<00:01:21.119> think<00:01:21.360> it's<00:01:21.509> about<00:01:21.630> right<00:01:22.020> either

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:22.619 
where you think it's about right either

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:24.050 
where you think it's about right either
break<00:01:22.950> off<00:01:23.130> a<00:01:23.159> piece<00:01:23.280> of<00:01:23.610> pop<00:01:23.729> it<00:01:23.850> on<00:01:23.970> will

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060 
break off a piece of pop it on will

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:26.120 
break off a piece of pop it on will
sacrifice<00:01:24.240> a<00:01:24.509> whole<00:01:24.810> one<00:01:25.020> and<00:01:25.229> just<00:01:25.799> try<00:01:26.070> it

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
sacrifice a whole one and just try it

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:27.890 
sacrifice a whole one and just try it
once<00:01:26.729> you've<00:01:26.880> got<00:01:26.970> the<00:01:27.090> temperature<00:01:27.479> right

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900 
once you've got the temperature right

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:29.749 
once you've got the temperature right
then<00:01:28.140> just<00:01:28.439> tweak<00:01:28.890> your<00:01:29.040> gas<00:01:29.220> to<00:01:29.460> make<00:01:29.579> sure

00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:29.759 
then just tweak your gas to make sure

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:31.700 
then just tweak your gas to make sure
you<00:01:29.850> don't<00:01:29.970> get<00:01:30.090> it<00:01:30.210> any<00:01:30.329> hotter<00:01:30.479> than<00:01:30.840> that<00:01:30.900> so

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
you don't get it any hotter than that so

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:33.800 
you don't get it any hotter than that so
I'll<00:01:32.130> show<00:01:32.280> you<00:01:32.369> what<00:01:32.490> what<00:01:32.759> you<00:01:32.880> do<00:01:33.030> basically

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810 
I'll show you what what you do basically

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:35.480 
I'll show you what what you do basically
it's<00:01:34.290> very<00:01:34.320> simple<00:01:34.500> to<00:01:34.860> get<00:01:34.920> nice<00:01:35.130> round

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
it's very simple to get nice round

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:36.620 
it's very simple to get nice round

popper Dom's

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:39.160 
popper Dom's
just<00:01:37.020> drop<00:01:37.200> it<00:01:37.350> into<00:01:37.470> your<00:01:37.590> hot<00:01:37.770> oil<00:01:38.070> like<00:01:38.549> that

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:39.170 
just drop it into your hot oil like that

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:42.319 
just drop it into your hot oil like that
and<00:01:40.170> it<00:01:40.350> will<00:01:40.439> start<00:01:40.650> to<00:01:40.829> bubble<00:01:40.950> up<00:01:41.220> to<00:01:42.000> a<00:01:42.030> few

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:42.329 
and it will start to bubble up to a few

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:46.789 
and it will start to bubble up to a few
seconds<00:01:42.840> turn<00:01:43.619> it<00:01:43.740> over<00:01:45.409> if<00:01:46.409> you're<00:01:46.560> doing<00:01:46.740> a

few seconds over on the other side and

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:59.389 
few seconds over on the other side and
then<00:01:54.780> out<00:01:55.079> you<00:01:55.670> can<00:01:56.670> get<00:01:56.790> a<00:01:56.820> grip<00:01:57.090> on<00:01:57.240> it<00:01:58.399> let

you want to put it in something that you

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:08.090 
you want to put it in something that you
can<00:02:05.880> stack<00:02:06.390> them<00:02:06.660> up<00:02:06.810> so<00:02:07.170> the<00:02:07.410> oil<00:02:07.620> continues

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:08.100 
can stack them up so the oil continues

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:13.490 
can stack them up so the oil continues
to<00:02:08.130> drain<00:02:08.550> off<00:02:10.460> something<00:02:11.460> like<00:02:11.610> that<00:02:12.500> and

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:13.500 
to drain off something like that and

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:15.890 
to drain off something like that and
then<00:02:13.830> just<00:02:13.950> work<00:02:14.130> your<00:02:14.340> way<00:02:14.430> along<00:02:14.580> and<00:02:15.090> if<00:02:15.780> you
