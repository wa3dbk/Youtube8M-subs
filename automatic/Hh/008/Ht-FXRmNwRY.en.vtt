00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:49.500 
few things in this trailer lots of

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:51.200 
few things in this trailer lots of
changes<00:01:49.770> to<00:01:49.920> the<00:01:50.130> launch<00:01:50.310> but<00:01:50.520> small<00:01:50.760> changes

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.210 
changes to the launch but small changes

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:54.080 
changes to the launch but small changes
but<00:01:51.600> significant<00:01:52.110> changes<00:01:52.470> so<00:01:53.190> let's<00:01:53.820> start

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090 
but significant changes so let's start

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:55.969 
but significant changes so let's start
up<00:01:54.270> by<00:01:54.450> talking<00:01:54.510> about<00:01:54.900> this<00:01:55.260> new<00:01:55.590> third

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:55.979 
up by talking about this new third

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:58.640 
up by talking about this new third
stabbed<00:01:56.400> in<00:01:56.610> the<00:01:56.640> standard<00:01:57.330> launch<00:01:57.570> 3po<00:01:58.200> combo

00:01:58.640 --> 00:01:58.650 
stabbed in the standard launch 3po combo

00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:00.380 
stabbed in the standard launch 3po combo
the<00:01:59.070> new<00:01:59.220> upwards<00:01:59.760> stabbed<00:02:00.090> in<00:02:00.270> that

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:00.390 
the new upwards stabbed in that

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:01.940 
the new upwards stabbed in that
three-point<00:02:00.840> combo<00:02:01.140> there's<00:02:01.380> probably<00:02:01.710> still

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:01.950 
three-point combo there's probably still

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:03.740 
three-point combo there's probably still
the<00:02:02.070> regular<00:02:02.550> forward<00:02:02.970> stab<00:02:03.210> because<00:02:03.600> I<00:02:03.690> know

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:03.750 
the regular forward stab because I know

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:05.150 
the regular forward stab because I know
that<00:02:03.990> you<00:02:04.050> have<00:02:04.170> the<00:02:04.259> option<00:02:04.710> to<00:02:04.740> do<00:02:04.920> it<00:02:05.040> or<00:02:05.130> not

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:05.160 
that you have the option to do it or not

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:07.969 
that you have the option to do it or not
but<00:02:06.030> the<00:02:06.119> new<00:02:06.270> upward<00:02:06.690> staff<00:02:06.960> is<00:02:07.200> a<00:02:07.229> multi-hit

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:07.979 
but the new upward staff is a multi-hit

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:10.400 
but the new upward staff is a multi-hit
which<00:02:08.220> has<00:02:08.369> a<00:02:08.399> wind-up<00:02:08.880> time<00:02:09.149> and<00:02:09.390> a<00:02:09.810> multi-hit

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:10.410 
which has a wind-up time and a multi-hit

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:12.380 
which has a wind-up time and a multi-hit
stab<00:02:10.709> which<00:02:10.920> apparently<00:02:11.160> does<00:02:11.640> huge<00:02:12.090> damage

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:12.390 
stab which apparently does huge damage

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:14.809 
stab which apparently does huge damage
and<00:02:12.660> multiple<00:02:13.410> hits<00:02:13.590> which<00:02:13.800> also<00:02:14.040> makes<00:02:14.310> Lance

00:02:14.809 --> 00:02:14.819 
and multiple hits which also makes Lance

00:02:14.819 --> 00:02:16.699 
and multiple hits which also makes Lance
a<00:02:15.030> lot<00:02:15.239> more<00:02:15.360> viable<00:02:15.569> as<00:02:15.840> an<00:02:15.930> elemental<00:02:16.440> weapon

00:02:16.699 --> 00:02:16.709 
a lot more viable as an elemental weapon

00:02:16.709 --> 00:02:18.050 
a lot more viable as an elemental weapon
so<00:02:17.100> what<00:02:17.220> do<00:02:17.280> you<00:02:17.340> guys<00:02:17.400> think<00:02:17.459> about<00:02:17.670> that<00:02:17.880> I

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:18.060 
so what do you guys think about that I

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:19.160 
so what do you guys think about that I
think<00:02:18.270> that's<00:02:18.390> quite<00:02:18.540> a<00:02:18.570> good<00:02:18.870> change

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:19.170 
think that's quite a good change

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:21.050 
think that's quite a good change
personally<00:02:19.770> yeah<00:02:20.040> I<00:02:20.100> think<00:02:20.430> it<00:02:20.610> makes<00:02:20.820> the

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:21.060 
personally yeah I think it makes the

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:23.810 
personally yeah I think it makes the
Lance<00:02:21.390> more<00:02:22.230> of<00:02:22.680> one<00:02:23.100> of<00:02:23.220> those<00:02:23.310> balanced

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:23.820 
Lance more of one of those balanced

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:26.120 
Lance more of one of those balanced
weapons<00:02:24.239> yeah<00:02:24.690> it<00:02:24.840> doesn't<00:02:25.140> rely<00:02:25.620> too<00:02:25.680> much<00:02:25.860> on

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:26.130 
weapons yeah it doesn't rely too much on

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:28.430 
weapons yeah it doesn't rely too much on
raw<00:02:26.430> or<00:02:26.760> element<00:02:27.239> it's<00:02:27.750> just<00:02:27.930> nice<00:02:28.170> in<00:02:28.350> the

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:28.440 
raw or element it's just nice in the

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:30.020 
raw or element it's just nice in the
middle<00:02:28.739> and<00:02:29.070> it<00:02:29.220> still<00:02:29.430> gets<00:02:29.580> off<00:02:29.700> a<00:02:29.760> lot<00:02:30.000> of

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:30.030 
middle and it still gets off a lot of

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:33.170 
middle and it still gets off a lot of
damage<00:02:30.600> on<00:02:30.840> both<00:02:30.989> sides<00:02:31.910> that'll<00:02:32.910> be<00:02:33.000> pretty

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:33.180 
damage on both sides that'll be pretty

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:34.699 
damage on both sides that'll be pretty
interesting<00:02:33.690> actually<00:02:33.810> as<00:02:34.200> opposed<00:02:34.530> to

00:02:34.699 --> 00:02:34.709 
interesting actually as opposed to

00:02:34.709 --> 00:02:36.560 
interesting actually as opposed to
before<00:02:34.830> I<00:02:35.070> always<00:02:35.340> primarily<00:02:36.030> with<00:02:36.300> sword<00:02:36.510> and

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:36.570 
before I always primarily with sword and

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:38.720 
before I always primarily with sword and
shield<00:02:36.690> and<00:02:36.989> dual<00:02:37.170> swords<00:02:37.560> that<00:02:37.680> rely<00:02:38.489> the<00:02:38.550> mat

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:38.730 
shield and dual swords that rely the mat

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:40.250 
shield and dual swords that rely the mat
heavily<00:02:38.880> on<00:02:39.269> everything<00:02:39.690> else<00:02:39.840> was<00:02:40.050> wrong

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:40.260 
heavily on everything else was wrong

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:42.680 
heavily on everything else was wrong
yeah<00:02:40.620> I<00:02:41.610> think<00:02:41.910> important<00:02:42.269> thing<00:02:42.390> to<00:02:42.510> note

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:42.690 
yeah I think important thing to note

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:44.750 
yeah I think important thing to note
though<00:02:42.870> that<00:02:43.050> third<00:02:43.560> strike<00:02:44.040> that<00:02:44.280> super

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:44.760 
though that third strike that super

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:47.960 
though that third strike that super
strike<00:02:45.030> has<00:02:45.480> super<00:02:46.440> armor<00:02:46.620> not<00:02:47.220> hyper<00:02:47.489> ama<00:02:47.760> you

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:47.970 
strike has super armor not hyper ama you

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:50.060 
strike has super armor not hyper ama you
can<00:02:48.120> still<00:02:48.360> take<00:02:48.540> damage<00:02:48.570> during<00:02:49.230> it<00:02:49.470> but<00:02:49.920> you

00:03:13.039 --> 00:03:13.049 
get away get away anyway so the super

00:03:13.049 --> 00:03:14.630 
get away get away anyway so the super
armor<00:03:13.170> on<00:03:13.320> that<00:03:13.440> attack<00:03:13.680> is<00:03:13.860> fantastic<00:03:14.519> it

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:14.640 
armor on that attack is fantastic it

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:16.940 
armor on that attack is fantastic it
also<00:03:14.880> allows<00:03:15.120> the<00:03:15.360> Lance<00:03:15.810> users<00:03:16.200> maybe<00:03:16.560> tank<00:03:16.860> a

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:16.950 
also allows the Lance users maybe tank a

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:18.319 
also allows the Lance users maybe tank a
bit<00:03:17.070> more<00:03:17.220> damage<00:03:17.579> and<00:03:17.700> I<00:03:18.000> think<00:03:18.239> it

00:03:18.319 --> 00:03:18.329 
bit more damage and I think it

00:03:18.329 --> 00:03:19.880 
bit more damage and I think it
encourages<00:03:18.600> guard<00:03:19.049> Lance<00:03:19.230> a<00:03:19.410> lot<00:03:19.560> because<00:03:19.709> as

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:19.890 
encourages guard Lance a lot because as

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:22.100 
encourages guard Lance a lot because as
you<00:03:20.010> can<00:03:20.040> see<00:03:20.190> out<00:03:20.610> of<00:03:20.670> the<00:03:21.030> counter<00:03:21.450> here<00:03:21.690> you

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:22.110 
you can see out of the counter here you

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:24.140 
you can see out of the counter here you
go<00:03:22.230> straight<00:03:22.530> into<00:03:22.799> the<00:03:22.920> super<00:03:23.310> stab<00:03:23.519> then<00:03:24.030> you

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:24.150 
go straight into the super stab then you

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:25.670 
go straight into the super stab then you
can<00:03:24.329> jab<00:03:24.570> again<00:03:24.930> and<00:03:25.140> then<00:03:25.470> you<00:03:25.530> can<00:03:25.650> go

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:25.680 
can jab again and then you can go

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:27.110 
can jab again and then you can go
straight<00:03:25.950> into<00:03:26.190> the<00:03:26.310> super<00:03:26.610> snap<00:03:26.760> because<00:03:26.910> the

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:27.120 
straight into the super snap because the

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:29.300 
straight into the super snap because the
super<00:03:28.049> snap<00:03:28.230> from<00:03:28.410> the<00:03:28.440> counter<00:03:28.980> counts<00:03:29.250> as

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:29.310 
super snap from the counter counts as

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:30.650 
super snap from the counter counts as
your<00:03:29.400> first<00:03:29.610> hit<00:03:29.880> for<00:03:29.910> the<00:03:30.030> three-year<00:03:30.360> combo

your first hit for the three-year combo

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:32.660 
your first hit for the three-year combo
I<00:03:30.810> think<00:03:31.380> that's<00:03:31.500> an<00:03:31.590> amazing<00:03:31.829> buff<00:03:32.310> to<00:03:32.549> the

of<00:04:23.930> iframes<00:04:24.440> if<00:04:24.800> that<00:04:24.979> forward<00:04:25.280> hot<00:04:25.400> but<00:04:25.550> you

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:25.610 
of iframes if that forward hot but you

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:27.400 
of iframes if that forward hot but you
can't<00:04:25.820> chain<00:04:26.060> them<00:04:26.210> together<00:04:26.330> either<00:04:26.690> so<00:04:27.380> I

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:27.410 
can't chain them together either so I

00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:28.870 
can't chain them together either so I
really<00:04:27.770> don't<00:04:27.979> think<00:04:28.039> that<00:04:28.280> a<00:04:28.370> babe<00:04:28.520> Lance<00:04:28.729> is

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:28.880 
really don't think that a babe Lance is

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:30.610 
really don't think that a babe Lance is
going<00:04:29.000> to<00:04:29.060> be<00:04:29.150> a<00:04:29.180> great<00:04:29.389> choice<00:04:29.600> with<00:04:30.080> Ariel

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:30.620 
going to be a great choice with Ariel

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:32.320 
going to be a great choice with Ariel
style<00:04:30.889> but<00:04:31.400> if<00:04:31.639> you<00:04:31.760> can<00:04:31.880> still<00:04:32.090> do<00:04:32.180> your

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:32.330 
style but if you can still do your

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:33.790 
style but if you can still do your
shield<00:04:32.600> advance<00:04:32.930> and<00:04:33.169> you<00:04:33.199> can<00:04:33.380> still<00:04:33.590> do<00:04:33.680> your

00:04:33.790 --> 00:04:33.800 
shield advance and you can still do your

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:35.590 
shield advance and you can still do your
counter<00:04:34.160> with<00:04:34.310> it<00:04:34.430> I<00:04:34.580> think<00:04:35.240> God<00:04:35.389> Lance

00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:35.600 
counter with it I think God Lance

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:38.439 
counter with it I think God Lance
aerostar<00:04:36.260> is<00:04:36.560> really<00:04:37.190> here<00:04:37.370> call<00:04:38.300> it<00:04:38.419> the

00:04:38.439 --> 00:04:38.449 
aerostar is really here call it the

00:04:38.449 --> 00:04:40.740 
aerostar is really here call it the
flying<00:04:38.780> guard<00:04:39.050> Lance<00:04:39.260> and<00:04:39.560> just<00:04:39.889> go<00:04:40.370> for<00:04:40.550> it

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:40.750 
flying guard Lance and just go for it

00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:44.890 
flying guard Lance and just go for it
yeah<00:04:41.750> um<00:04:42.400> I<00:04:43.400> really<00:04:44.000> like<00:04:44.240> the<00:04:44.419> fact<00:04:44.600> that<00:04:44.750> you

00:04:44.890 --> 00:04:44.900 
yeah um I really like the fact that you

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:46.420 
yeah um I really like the fact that you
can<00:04:45.080> go<00:04:45.199> straight<00:04:45.530> into<00:04:45.830> your<00:04:45.949> charge<00:04:46.280> attack

00:04:46.420 --> 00:04:46.430 
can go straight into your charge attack

00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:48.370 
can go straight into your charge attack
from<00:04:46.850> the<00:04:47.030> aerial<00:04:47.389> with<00:04:47.510> the<00:04:47.600> Lance<00:04:47.810> I<00:04:48.080> think

00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:48.380 
from the aerial with the Lance I think

00:04:48.380 --> 00:04:50.890 
from the aerial with the Lance I think
that's<00:04:48.530> really<00:04:48.650> interesting<00:04:48.830> ah<00:04:49.449> I<00:04:50.449> think

00:04:50.890 --> 00:04:50.900 
that's really interesting ah I think

00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:52.930 
that's really interesting ah I think
that<00:04:51.080> it<00:04:51.199> was<00:04:51.260> interesting<00:04:51.919> to<00:04:51.949> see<00:04:52.340> the<00:04:52.370> turn

00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:52.940 
that it was interesting to see the turn

00:04:52.940 --> 00:04:55.900 
that it was interesting to see the turn
attack<00:04:53.270> is<00:04:54.070> straight<00:04:55.070> out<00:04:55.220> of<00:04:55.310> that<00:04:55.639> God

00:04:55.900 --> 00:04:55.910 
attack is straight out of that God

00:04:55.910 --> 00:04:58.409 
attack is straight out of that God
attack<00:04:56.180> jump<00:04:56.479> so<00:04:56.810> he<00:04:56.900> does<00:04:57.020> the<00:04:57.139> jump<00:04:57.380> into<00:04:57.620> the

00:04:58.409 --> 00:04:58.419 
attack jump so he does the jump into the

00:04:58.419 --> 00:05:00.760 
attack jump so he does the jump into the
charge<00:04:59.419> attack<00:04:59.539> and<00:04:59.900> then<00:05:00.229> turns<00:05:00.470> around<00:05:00.620> and

00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:00.770 
charge attack and then turns around and

00:05:00.770 --> 00:05:02.260 
charge attack and then turns around and
hits<00:05:00.950> them<00:05:01.070> with<00:05:01.099> that<00:05:01.310> turnaround<00:05:01.639> swipe<00:05:02.060> I

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:02.270 
hits them with that turnaround swipe I

00:05:02.270 --> 00:05:03.550 
hits them with that turnaround swipe I
think<00:05:02.720> that<00:05:02.840> that<00:05:03.020> will<00:05:03.200> mean<00:05:03.380> that<00:05:03.410> the

00:05:03.550 --> 00:05:03.560 
think that that will mean that the

00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:05.260 
think that that will mean that the
turnaround<00:05:03.979> swipe<00:05:04.160> will<00:05:04.340> be<00:05:04.430> used<00:05:04.639> a<00:05:04.789> lot<00:05:04.940> more

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:05.270 
turnaround swipe will be used a lot more

00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:07.270 
turnaround swipe will be used a lot more
it's<00:05:05.539> a<00:05:05.630> move<00:05:05.780> that<00:05:05.810> isn't<00:05:06.229> often<00:05:06.410> used<00:05:06.740> in<00:05:06.979> for

00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:07.280 
it's a move that isn't often used in for

00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:09.339 
it's a move that isn't often used in for
you<00:05:07.490> denied<00:05:08.450> the<00:05:08.630> fact<00:05:08.750> that<00:05:08.840> it's<00:05:09.020> very<00:05:09.169> fancy

00:05:09.339 --> 00:05:09.349 
you denied the fact that it's very fancy

00:05:09.349 --> 00:05:12.520 
you denied the fact that it's very fancy
can<00:05:09.710> very<00:05:09.889> pretty<00:05:10.099> I<00:05:10.750> feel<00:05:11.750> like<00:05:11.900> and<00:05:12.139> this<00:05:12.470> is

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:12.530 
can very pretty I feel like and this is

00:05:12.530 --> 00:05:15.520 
can very pretty I feel like and this is
probably<00:05:13.010> a<00:05:13.160> little<00:05:13.280> silly<00:05:13.669> but<00:05:13.820> uh<00:05:14.380> rides<00:05:15.380> are

00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:15.530 
probably a little silly but uh rides are

00:05:15.530 --> 00:05:16.930 
probably a little silly but uh rides are
gonna<00:05:15.620> be<00:05:15.800> a<00:05:15.830> little<00:05:16.039> bit<00:05:16.250> easier<00:05:16.580> to<00:05:16.610> give<00:05:16.820> up

00:05:16.930 --> 00:05:16.940 
gonna be a little bit easier to give up

00:05:16.940 --> 00:05:18.640 
gonna be a little bit easier to give up

00:05:26.409 --> 00:05:26.419 
to do the jump and then could only

00:05:26.419 --> 00:05:27.850

00:05:52.210 --> 00:05:52.220 
is a shield charge it's just basically

what<00:06:28.530> we've<00:06:28.710> seen<00:06:28.830> from<00:06:28.890> the<00:06:29.130> trailer<00:06:29.400> it

00:06:29.540 --> 00:06:29.550 
what we've seen from the trailer it

00:06:29.550 --> 00:06:31.130 
what we've seen from the trailer it
looks<00:06:29.580> like<00:06:30.090> as<00:06:30.240> soon<00:06:30.390> as<00:06:30.540> you<00:06:30.600> get<00:06:30.720> two<00:06:30.900> of<00:06:30.930> the

00:06:31.130 --> 00:06:31.140 
looks like as soon as you get two of the

shield bash hits off it automatically

00:06:32.910 --> 00:06:34.250 
shield bash hits off it automatically
stabs<00:06:33.270> but<00:06:33.660> that<00:06:33.780> could<00:06:33.990> have<00:06:34.080> been<00:06:34.140> the

00:06:34.250 --> 00:06:34.260 
stabs but that could have been the

00:06:34.260 --> 00:06:35.810 
stabs but that could have been the
person<00:06:34.410> had<00:06:34.680> the<00:06:34.770> control<00:06:35.070> of<00:06:35.100> pro<00:06:35.370> at<00:06:35.700> the

control add the 3ds pressing the stamp
on<00:06:37.980> or<00:06:38.490> it<00:06:38.790> could<00:06:38.970> be<00:06:39.000> that<00:06:39.660> it<00:06:39.810> forces<00:06:40.260> you

00:06:40.430 --> 00:06:40.440 
on or it could be that it forces you

that<00:06:42.000> could<00:06:42.120> be<00:06:42.180> a<00:06:42.210> really<00:06:42.450> good<00:06:42.540> way<00:06:42.690> to<00:06:42.750> care

00:06:43.070 --> 00:06:43.080 
that could be a really good way to care

00:06:43.080 --> 00:06:45.680 
that could be a really good way to care
