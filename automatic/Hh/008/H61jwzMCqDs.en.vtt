00:00:01.710 --> 00:00:07.930
 imagine a world in which we help 

00:00:04.420 --> 00:00:10.559
 preserve natural resources a 

00:00:07.930 --> 00:00:12.999
 world in which we do more with less 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:16.110
 thanks to a new concept of work 

00:00:12.999 --> 00:00:16.110
 eco-efficiency 

00:00:19.850 --> 00:00:27.430
 imagine materials with a lot of life that 

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:29.980
 They can be recycled again and again 

00:00:27.430 --> 00:00:34.290
 to light a bulb with what up 

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:38.600
 now we simply discard 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:38.600
 imagine a better world 

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:44.810
 in the saica group we work every day 

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:48.640
 making this dream come true 

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:51.740
 reduce reuse recycle and enhance 

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:53.120
 a clear environmental commitment that 

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:56.540
 for more than half a century 

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:58.850
 guide our work a philosophy that 

00:00:56.540 --> 00:01:01.070
 has allowed to provide support 

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:02.600
 key strategy to any company 

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:04.760
 that seeks the valuation of its 

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:07.960
 secondary raw materials and management 

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:07.960
 efficient of your waste 

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:13.840
 be European leaders in manufacturing 

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:16.260
 of paper for packaging and boxes 

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:16.260
 corrugated paperboard 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:23.100
 and develop together with our customers 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:26.900
 sustainable packaging solutions and 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:29.960
 innovators that favor development 

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:33.610
 all this always putting the 

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:33.610
 safety of each person 

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:39.620
 but we want more there is always a way out 

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:42.820
 alternative and landfill our goal 

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:42.820
 inverted zero 

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:48.229
 clear vocation for recycling and 

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:51.470
 reuse teaches us that each 

00:01:48.229 --> 00:01:53.840
 waste is an opportunity 

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:56.150
 that is why we encourage production cycles 

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:57.680
 sustainable practices that maximize the value of 

00:01:56.150 --> 00:01:59.690
 waste as raw material 

00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:02.150
 high school 

00:01:59.690 --> 00:02:04.400
 proof of this commitment is the plant 

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:06.500
 of energy recovery in the borough 

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:08.810
 of ebro a strategic project 

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:10.369
 sustainable and innovative with which we give 

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:12.380
 an alternative exit to those 

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:15.470
 waste that until now could not be 

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:17.810
 recycled finishing a landfill instead 

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:19.640
 of it after a meticulous classification 

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:23.030
 and crushing the waste are 

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:25.040
 converted into this r fuel 

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:26.780
 this fuel is stored and 

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:29.330
 transported to a bed boiler 

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:31.130
 fluid that generates enough steam 

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:33.680
 to get through a large 

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:36.290
 turbine 49 megawatts of energy 

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:38.440
 mostly supplied to the network 

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:38.440
 electric 

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:45.030
 well to sake firmly committed to 

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:48.350
 the environment leaders in 

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:48.350
 sustainability and innovation 

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:55.280
 shaikh managing your waste 

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:55.280
 we build the future
