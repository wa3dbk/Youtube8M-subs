00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:22.780 
could in a million years I didn't have a

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:25.500 
could in a million years I didn't have a
child<00:02:22.989> who<00:02:23.049> and<00:02:23.170> then<00:02:23.260> tendo's<00:02:23.590> stop<00:02:24.510> asking

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:25.510 
child who and then tendo's stop asking

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:26.699 
child who and then tendo's stop asking
but<00:02:25.629> then<00:02:25.780> again<00:02:25.870> I've<00:02:26.080> done<00:02:26.260> stuff<00:02:26.530> in<00:02:26.650> the

00:02:26.699 --> 00:02:26.709 
but then again I've done stuff in the

00:02:26.709 --> 00:02:29.640 
but then again I've done stuff in the
past<00:02:26.890> like<00:02:27.129> slender<00:02:27.879> so<00:02:28.180> you<00:02:28.239> know<00:02:28.510> it's<00:02:28.840> a

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:29.650 
past like slender so you know it's a

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:31.470 
past like slender so you know it's a
mishmash<00:02:29.920> yes<00:02:30.250> it's<00:02:30.459> a<00:02:30.549> review<00:02:30.879> show<00:02:31.090> of

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:31.480 
mishmash yes it's a review show of

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:33.809 
mishmash yes it's a review show of
mostly<00:02:32.110> retro<00:02:32.500> games<00:02:32.739> but<00:02:32.980> occasionally<00:02:33.430> just

00:02:33.809 --> 00:02:33.819 
mostly retro games but occasionally just

00:02:33.819 --> 00:02:36.360 
mostly retro games but occasionally just
something<00:02:34.329> that<00:02:34.360> you<00:02:34.930> know<00:02:35.079> probably<00:02:35.890> springs

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:36.370 
something that you know probably springs

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:38.009 
something that you know probably springs
to<00:02:36.489> fancy<00:02:36.790> if<00:02:36.849> I<00:02:36.940> can<00:02:37.090> make<00:02:37.239> a<00:02:37.269> few<00:02:37.630> good<00:02:37.840> jokes

00:02:38.009 --> 00:02:38.019 
to fancy if I can make a few good jokes

00:02:38.019 --> 00:02:40.520 
to fancy if I can make a few good jokes
out<00:02:38.230> of<00:02:38.349> it<00:02:38.470> I'll<00:02:38.620> probably<00:02:38.860> make<00:02:39.190> it<00:02:39.400> into<00:02:39.970> a

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:40.530 
out of it I'll probably make it into a

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:42.809 
out of it I'll probably make it into a
episode<00:02:41.530> so<00:02:41.769> yeah<00:02:41.890> that's<00:02:42.099> my<00:02:42.130> main<00:02:42.400> show<00:02:42.640> my

every week on the sunday and maybe the

00:05:00.670 --> 00:05:02.280 
every week on the sunday and maybe the
current<00:05:00.850> quickies<00:05:01.330> would<00:05:01.570> be<00:05:01.750> kind<00:05:01.990> of<00:05:02.050> in

00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:02.290 
current quickies would be kind of in

00:05:02.290 --> 00:05:05.070 
current quickies would be kind of in
between<00:05:02.860> if<00:05:03.730> it<00:05:03.970> depends<00:05:04.450> but<00:05:04.660> most<00:05:04.870> of<00:05:05.020> the

00:05:05.070 --> 00:05:05.080 
between if it depends but most of the

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:07.740 
between if it depends but most of the
time<00:05:05.290> pretty<00:05:06.130> much<00:05:06.220> expect<00:05:06.970> to<00:05:07.210> have<00:05:07.360> a<00:05:07.390> video

00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:07.750 
time pretty much expect to have a video

00:05:07.750 --> 00:05:09.930 
time pretty much expect to have a video
from<00:05:08.080> me<00:05:08.290> once<00:05:08.710> every<00:05:08.890> two<00:05:09.160> weeks<00:05:09.190> on<00:05:09.520> a<00:05:09.550> Sunday

that's a very good question and the
simple<00:05:18.580> answer<00:05:18.790> is<00:05:18.820> I<00:05:19.150> have<00:05:19.570> a<00:05:19.750> lot<00:05:20.110> of<00:05:20.290> jobs<00:05:20.800> I

big<00:05:44.200> load<00:05:44.620> off<00:05:44.770> my<00:05:44.800> shoulders<00:05:44.950> and<00:05:45.610> we<00:05:45.940> can

00:05:46.110 --> 00:05:46.120 
big load off my shoulders and we can

00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:47.700

still<00:05:47.919> got<00:05:48.070> the<00:05:48.160> jobs<00:05:48.370> that's<00:05:48.610> why<00:05:48.820> I<00:05:48.850> have<00:05:49.330> to

00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:49.450 
still got the jobs that's why I have to

00:05:49.450 --> 00:05:51.630 
still got the jobs that's why I have to
extend<00:05:49.990> the<00:05:50.230> upload<00:05:50.530> times<00:05:50.770> that<00:05:51.160> and<00:05:51.370> I<00:05:51.400> used

00:05:51.630 --> 00:05:51.640 
extend the upload times that and I used

00:05:51.640 --> 00:05:53.220 
extend the upload times that and I used
to<00:05:51.700> make<00:05:51.880> one<00:05:52.060> a<00:05:52.090> week<00:05:52.300> and<00:05:52.540> I<00:05:52.600> actually<00:05:52.810> made

00:05:53.220 --> 00:05:53.230 
to make one a week and I actually made

00:05:53.230 --> 00:05:55.290 
to make one a week and I actually made
myself<00:05:53.410> a<00:05:53.770> very<00:05:53.950> ill<00:05:54.370> and<00:05:54.700> I<00:05:54.760> had<00:05:54.790> to<00:05:55.090> take<00:05:55.270> a

00:05:55.290 --> 00:05:55.300 
myself a very ill and I had to take a

00:05:55.300 --> 00:05:57.600 
myself a very ill and I had to take a
week<00:05:55.630> off<00:05:55.870> I<00:05:56.260> was<00:05:56.620> bedridden<00:05:56.800> for<00:05:56.980> three<00:05:57.400> days

00:05:57.600 --> 00:05:57.610 
week off I was bedridden for three days

00:05:57.610 --> 00:05:59.790 
week off I was bedridden for three days
because<00:05:57.880> one<00:05:58.510> video<00:05:58.960> a<00:05:58.990> week<00:05:59.080> along<00:05:59.620> with

00:05:59.790 --> 00:05:59.800 
because one video a week along with

00:05:59.800 --> 00:06:02.250 
because one video a week along with
everything<00:06:00.100> else<00:06:00.340> I<00:06:00.460> was<00:06:00.490> doing<00:06:00.940> it<00:06:01.419> killed<00:06:01.870> me

00:06:02.250 --> 00:06:02.260 
everything else I was doing it killed me

00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:04.890 
everything else I was doing it killed me
so<00:06:02.380> that<00:06:02.650> is<00:06:02.830> why<00:06:03.070> upload<00:06:03.850> times<00:06:04.090> I<00:06:04.300> once<00:06:04.510> every

00:06:04.890 --> 00:06:04.900 
so that is why upload times I once every

00:06:04.900 --> 00:06:06.500 
so that is why upload times I once every
two<00:06:05.080> weeks<00:06:05.410> if<00:06:05.590> you<00:06:05.680> want<00:06:05.890> to<00:06:06.040> get<00:06:06.190> the<00:06:06.280> best

00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:06.510 
two weeks if you want to get the best

00:06:06.510 --> 00:06:10.980 
two weeks if you want to get the best
results<00:06:07.510> from<00:06:07.810> me<00:06:08.970> let<00:06:09.970> let<00:06:10.360> that<00:06:10.570> lift<00:06:10.840> the

00:06:10.980 --> 00:06:10.990 
results from me let let that lift the

00:06:10.990 --> 00:06:13.020 
results from me let let that lift the
time<00:06:11.230> take<00:06:12.100> its<00:06:12.280> course<00:06:12.490> and<00:06:12.820> the<00:06:12.910> other

00:06:13.020 --> 00:06:13.030 
time take its course and the other

00:06:13.030 --> 00:06:15.270 
time take its course and the other
reason<00:06:13.360> for<00:06:13.390> these<00:06:13.570> long<00:06:13.990> upload<00:06:14.590> gaps<00:06:14.890> on<00:06:15.130> my

00:06:15.270 --> 00:06:15.280 
reason for these long upload gaps on my

00:06:15.280 --> 00:06:17.700 
reason for these long upload gaps on my
channel<00:06:15.700> is<00:06:15.880> because<00:06:16.180> I<00:06:16.600> actually<00:06:17.290> have

00:06:17.700 --> 00:06:17.710 
channel is because I actually have

00:06:17.710 --> 00:06:20.850 
channel is because I actually have
another<00:06:18.070> video<00:06:18.280> making<00:06:18.760> job<00:06:19.750> let's<00:06:20.169> say<00:06:20.380> with
