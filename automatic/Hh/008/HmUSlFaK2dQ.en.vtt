00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:18.260
 hello girls and guys good today 

00:00:15.380 --> 00:00:21.529
 I'm going to teach you a very easy way 

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:24.680
 to be able to extract or edit or as you 

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:30.050
 they want to say take out a granite and that 

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:33.620
 leave mark this technique is very easy 

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:35.810
 very simple with very instruments 

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:39.530
 easy and I'll explain step by step 

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:41.630
 for you to do it this way then you 

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:44.630
 It helps not to leave marks because like you 

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:46.970
 you take it off like that with your finger and you do not know 

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:49.010
 more or less uncomfortable then you 

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:51.860
 It helps a lot to avoid you 

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:54.170
 leave a mark on the face then it is 

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:56.360
 super easy the procedure and good what 

00:00:54.170 --> 00:01:00.470
 what we are going to need is going to be water 

00:00:56.360 --> 00:01:03.290
 oxygenated or alcohol we will need 

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:05.420
 and we are objective as you know them 

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:11.390
 but it's these and we're going to use 

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:13.280
 also a needle and a lighter and 

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:18.310
 Well first thing we're going to do 

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:18.310
 to clean the needle with hydrogen peroxide 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:25.700
 so that a trickle falls on the tip 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:28.820
 and after that 

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:30.920
 let's pass him the lighter by 

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:33.939
 Ensemble not so much time because then it 

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:37.179
 He heats is here he does not take so much 

00:01:33.939 --> 00:01:41.450
 already after this we already use it 

00:01:37.179 --> 00:01:43.640
 so as he is bold, only 

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:46.210
 let's go through enimita paper for 

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:46.210
 that you 

00:01:46.659 --> 00:01:51.369
 that's how it always gets to metal and good 

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:52.929
 is already sterilized then what 

00:01:51.369 --> 00:01:55.090
 let's do I have a granite 

00:01:52.929 --> 00:01:57.370
 then I will take advantage to be able 

00:01:55.090 --> 00:02:00.900
 do the extraction very well 

00:01:57.370 --> 00:02:00.900
 then what are we going to do 

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:08.119
 okay 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:08.119
 does not itch 

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:17.320
 had those that gives him an opening 

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:20.840
 I'm sure I did an adventure 

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:23.020
 now what I am going to do we are going to 

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:26.330
 battle because as I'm recording 

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:29.120
 then I will have a little bit the same 

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:31.160
 the first time you do not have it left or it is not 

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:35.090
 do you very well 

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:37.820
 with this technique you will achieve here already 

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:41.180
 you see that this text is granites sometimes 

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:44.690
 it looks like days later it turns you 

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:46.940
 to leave the same granite as that what 

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:48.980
 we had inside to come back out or be the 

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:51.740
 It's greasy that made us come out 

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:56.260
 as yellowish then what are we going to 

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:58.860
 do you're going to give the critic's the two 

00:02:56.260 --> 00:03:04.430
 and what are you going to do, let's do this 

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:04.430
 let's try that letter all 

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:08.280
 how found 

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:20.090
 it hurts a little bit I will not lie if it hurts or 

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:23.420
 be depending on what grain because 

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:26.630
 those who hurt a lot arrive but you have 

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:30.890
 to make sure you get everything out and if 

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:33.680
 you get sangrita sacate a little more 

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:39.470
 although not see and I amarillito SÃ¡cate 

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:44.810
 more so this one goes to corroborate that you do not 

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:46.340
 go out more like the days after 

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:48.620
 more yellowish what is watching you 

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:51.030
 right now I will corroborate well 

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:52.920
 that I have left everything 

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:55.530
 will be rojito and as this will 

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:57.810
 be normal but as I say 

00:03:55.530 --> 00:04:00.010
 and is that mustache very well that is mature 

00:03:57.810 --> 00:04:02.000
 so you have 

00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:04.250
 yellow that means they are 

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:07.790
 mature and it's not like that, do not go to 

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:11.299
 take out because if you do it you're not going to be 

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:13.879
 like little red and it will swell I'm going 

00:04:11.299 --> 00:04:16.220
 to give a tip for the nose the nose is 

00:04:13.879 --> 00:04:18.350
 very good to extract it is the same although 

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:21.769
 do not have pimples that something will come out 

00:04:18.350 --> 00:04:23.300
 I have mixed skin then if I have it 

00:04:21.769 --> 00:04:26.690
 that needs the part of the nose 

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:28.639
 then I do it like that and I start 

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:32.440
 extract extract like I tell you I do not have 

00:04:28.639 --> 00:04:35.350
 no grain and you start from your fingers 

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:37.470
 because of the skin you start to discs and 

00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:40.930
 also to mari and as well as that of each 

00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:43.540
 point I do not know how to tell you from every pore 

00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:46.390
 I ask for salt and yellow things for everything 

00:04:43.540 --> 00:04:48.580
 do it that little bit, take me out like that all 

00:04:46.390 --> 00:04:50.320
 all all all the nose its 

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:52.240
 successful because you do it and not have 

00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:54.100
 no big left yellow yellow 

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:55.960
 yellows imported to the nose and 

00:04:54.100 --> 00:04:59.230
 parents the nose is that as you do it 

00:04:55.960 --> 00:05:01.830
 nothing else you have red and you do not run the 

00:04:59.230 --> 00:05:04.000
 risk as you have the best 

00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:05.780
 hurt or something like that is the easiest thing 

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:08.389
 to remove 

00:05:05.780 --> 00:05:10.010
 so all the great quote that we have 

00:05:08.389 --> 00:05:12.500
 all the impurities that we have inside 

00:05:10.010 --> 00:05:15.410
 and I recommend that you wash each 

00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:18.139
 two weeks is to get rid of impurities 

00:05:15.410 --> 00:05:20.840
 the nose because where else together and 

00:05:18.139 --> 00:05:23.510
 you also have to check more than 

00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:25.910
 your face I also like that 

00:05:23.510 --> 00:05:28.010
 here and I distracted me a little that is 

00:05:25.910 --> 00:05:31.220
 from here the chin on the forehead does not 

00:05:28.010 --> 00:05:33.889
 I had nothing more this granite and well then 

00:05:31.220 --> 00:05:36.110
 that would be all I hope and will serve you this 

00:05:33.889 --> 00:05:38.450
 video and this technique that is not so 

00:05:36.110 --> 00:05:41.090
 difficult and complicated but it helps you 

00:05:38.450 --> 00:05:43.700
 very much to achieve then take away the 

00:05:41.090 --> 00:05:46.840
 granite and good see you until the 

00:05:43.700 --> 00:05:46.840
 next video bye 

00:05:47.300 --> 00:05:50.300
 and 

00:05:55.300 --> 00:06:01.669
 and 

00:05:58.289 --> 00:06:01.669
 it's okay
