00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:17.520
 and the news that Paul bought bh 

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:19.650
 electronics for 3,200 million 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:21.290
 dollars is all over the network despite 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:24.539
 have not been officially confirmed 

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:27.480
 however, it has already been taken by many 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:29.220
 as a fact whether the potential is real or not 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:31.230
 of this acquisition remains in the air 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:33.540
 there is no simple way to 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:35.130
 understand its meaning the best 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:36.899
 indication which is about the 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:39.059
 veracity of this purchase is a 

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:41.280
 publication on the facebook page of 

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:43.440
 actor tyrese gibson where you can see 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:45.629
 to the doctor of the hip hop singer and 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:48.059
 co-founder of beatz who started this 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:49.920
 company six years ago talking about 

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:52.499
 the purchase and upon his arrival at the club 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:54.629
 the billionaire guys dr.dre 

00:00:52.499 --> 00:00:56.519
 appears in a video taken by the actor 

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:59.010
 throw yourself gibson where they talk about the 

00:00:56.519 --> 00:01:01.319
 purchase dr.dre appears in a video taken 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:03.719
 by actor tyrese gibson where they speak 

00:01:01.319 --> 00:01:06.000
 about the purchase next to that video that 

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:08.100
 unfortunately it was removed little 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.380
 after its publication it read the 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:12.479
 text as I finish in the study with 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:14.970
 dr.dre on the night that was made public 

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:17.700
 the deal he made with the pool for 3,200 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:19.290
 million beatz earphones have just 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:21.690
 switch to hip hop 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:24.480
 he wrote gibson now so he wants to 

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:26.910
 pola beatz you have to remember something to 

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:28.860
 difference from other brands like htc that 

00:01:26.910 --> 00:01:31.050
 they included a prominent see in some 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:33.210
 smartphone models to promote 

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:35.490
 that those devices included beatz 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:37.980
 audio and paul is widely known for 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:39.630
 keep your brand intact so the 

00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:41.520
 probability that see a 'ipad' or 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:44.070
 ipone with the print is practically 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:46.410
 null out of this the plan of 'Paul' 

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:48.330
 can be much more ambitious than that of 

00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:50.610
 put a better audio chip to your 

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:52.800
 products the company could be 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:55.110
 preparing to grow the brand 

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:58.020
 beatz up to heaven this without doing 

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:59.970
 really transcendental changes beatz 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:02.610
 since beatz has the whole exhibition 

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:04.500
 public that has even needed was the 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:06.630
 mark that the athletes used in the 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:08.910
 last olympic games and came to 

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:10.649
 unseat the iconic white hearing aid from 

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:12.780
 'hip-hop' to take its place as the 

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:14.640
 hearing aids that everyone wants to have and Paul 

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:17.580
 I would be buying a passport to 

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:19.530
 potentially infinite gains according to 

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:21.810
 a publication of the new york times' 

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:24.330
 of 2013 it is estimated that a couple of 

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:26.220
 headphones that cost $ 200 

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:28.020
 fashion brands like beat 

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:30.180
 in an attractive design but not 

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:32.550
 necessarily the best audio quality 

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:34.170
 can have a production price of 

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:36.450
 only 14 dollars 

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:38.250
 this is the merit of beatz because it was achieved 

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:40.020
 make a brand that people 

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:42.060
 they aspire and that is not necessarily 

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:44.610
 accessible but offering a 

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:46.560
 acceptable sound experience without leaving 

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:48.810
 sideways a wide profit margin 

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:51.320
 for the company that designs them manufactures and 

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:54.000
 then distribute what can be expected 

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:56.580
 Paul's plans to take advantage 

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:58.830
 of this acquisition are not clear and 

00:02:56.580 --> 00:03:01.020
 it may be a while before 

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:03.060
 be revealed there are at least two 

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:05.520
 possible uses that could be given to the 

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:07.410
 The first one is for Paul to have a 

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:09.840
 wide line of accessories for your 

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:12.150
 products all with the brand see being 

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:14.070
 used independently although 

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:16.140
 doing some campaign that links 

00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:17.790
 both firms to position them in the 

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:20.610
 customers like a 

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:23.010
 Perfect combination dr.dre using a 

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:24.959
 couple of beas dr.dre using a pair of 

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:27.540
 beatz is also the way of 

00:03:24.959 --> 00:03:29.790
 streaming audio since beatz has its 

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:32.040
 audio music service that works 

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:33.180
 way similar to spotify and had a good 

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:35.939
 welcome in your 

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:37.920
 what happened a few months ago there is a great 

00:03:35.939 --> 00:03:39.629
 probability that paul will use this 

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:41.939
 to complement your services 

00:03:39.629 --> 00:03:44.400
 Musical purchases of music in 

00:03:41.939 --> 00:03:46.769
 itunes although they are still in progress 

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:48.510
 they are not as popular as before and 

00:03:46.769 --> 00:03:50.519
 people have begun to migrate to 

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:52.469
 streaming services instead of 

00:03:50.519 --> 00:03:54.329
 Acquire song by song for your 

00:03:52.469 --> 00:03:57.000
 library then 

00:03:54.329 --> 00:03:59.159
 beatz music could be the answer of 

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:01.530
 be confirmed by the pool the purchase of 

00:03:59.159 --> 00:04:03.750
 beat would be the most expensive I've made 

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:05.609
 this company in years and it would show the 

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:07.590
 interest of the apple brand by 

00:04:05.609 --> 00:04:09.689
 find a new ally to stay 

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:11.250
 in the taste of the younger market that is 

00:04:09.689 --> 00:04:13.799
 also the one who can consume more 

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:17.419
 products and services just wait 

00:04:13.799 --> 00:04:17.419
