00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:26.260 
take a look at the pattern it is indeed

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:28.680 
take a look at the pattern it is indeed
a<00:00:26.320> paradiddle<00:00:27.090> we're<00:00:28.090> going<00:00:28.210> to<00:00:28.270> start<00:00:28.570> by

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:28.690 
a paradiddle we're going to start by

00:00:28.690 --> 00:00:30.060 
a paradiddle we're going to start by
playing<00:00:28.930> our<00:00:29.080> right<00:00:29.260> hand<00:00:29.530> on<00:00:29.830> the<00:00:29.890> right

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:30.070 
playing our right hand on the right

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:32.280 
playing our right hand on the right
cymbal<00:00:30.730> and<00:00:30.910> the<00:00:31.360> left<00:00:31.570> hand<00:00:31.810> on<00:00:32.050> the<00:00:32.230> snare

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:57.390 
cymbal and the left hand on the snare
like<00:00:33.160> so<00:00:55.110> you'll<00:00:56.110> notice<00:00:56.440> that<00:00:56.590> the<00:00:56.740> L<00:00:56.890> is<00:00:57.250> the

00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:57.400 
like so you'll notice that the L is the

00:00:57.400 --> 00:00:59.280 
like so you'll notice that the L is the
backbeat<00:00:57.820> of<00:00:57.970> the<00:00:58.120> groove<00:00:58.420> it<00:00:58.870> should<00:00:59.140> be

00:00:59.280 --> 00:00:59.290 
backbeat of the groove it should be

00:00:59.290 --> 00:01:01.979 
backbeat of the groove it should be
played<00:00:59.560> loud<00:01:00.070> and<00:01:00.400> prominent<00:01:01.000> as<00:01:01.180> opposed<00:01:01.840> to

played loud and prominent as opposed to
those<00:01:02.200> notes<00:01:02.560> around<00:01:03.070> it<00:01:03.370> which<00:01:04.030> should<00:01:04.210> be

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:04.270 
those notes around it which should be

00:01:04.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
those notes around it which should be
played<00:01:05.110> quieter<00:01:05.910> also<00:01:06.990> think<00:01:07.990> of<00:01:08.110> these<00:01:08.259> as

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:08.290 
played quieter also think of these as

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:24.410 
played quieter also think of these as
sixteenth<00:01:09.190> notes

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:26.850

the contrast away from those one good

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:28.070 
the contrast away from those one good
way<00:02:10.750> of<00:02:10.780> doing<00:02:11.080> this<00:02:11.380> is<00:02:11.620> to<00:02:11.650> use<00:02:11.890> rim<00:02:12.190> shots

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:28.080 

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:30.390 

let<00:02:29.080> me<00:02:29.170> show<00:02:29.320> you<00:02:29.380> what<00:02:29.560> I<00:02:29.650> find<00:02:29.920> to<00:02:30.100> be<00:02:30.190> one<00:02:30.340> of

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:30.400 
let me show you what I find to be one of

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:31.980 
let me show you what I find to be one of
the<00:02:30.460> most<00:02:30.640> effective<00:02:31.120> kick<00:02:31.360> patterns<00:02:31.780> for

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:31.990 
the most effective kick patterns for

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:33.810 
the most effective kick patterns for
this<00:02:32.110> groove<00:02:32.470> I'll<00:02:32.740> play<00:02:33.340> it<00:02:33.430> without<00:02:33.520> the

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:33.820 
this groove I'll play it without the

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:35.400 
this groove I'll play it without the
paradiddle<00:02:34.180> so<00:02:34.540> you<00:02:34.630> can<00:02:34.750> really<00:02:34.990> see<00:02:35.170> what<00:02:35.320> it

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:35.410 
paradiddle so you can really see what it

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:54.870 
paradiddle so you can really see what it
is<00:02:35.440> now<00:02:52.710> let's<00:02:53.710> combine<00:02:53.980> the<00:02:54.250> pattern<00:02:54.670> with

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:54.880 
is now let's combine the pattern with

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:57.570 
is now let's combine the pattern with
the<00:02:55.030> kick<00:02:55.500> now<00:02:56.500> if<00:02:56.830> you're<00:02:56.980> not<00:02:57.130> used<00:02:57.340> to<00:02:57.430> the

00:02:57.570 --> 00:02:57.580 
the kick now if you're not used to the

00:02:57.580 --> 00:02:59.370 
the kick now if you're not used to the
independence<00:02:58.180> of<00:02:58.360> this<00:02:58.510> it<00:02:58.750> might<00:02:58.960> get<00:02:59.110> kind

00:02:59.370 --> 00:02:59.380 
independence of this it might get kind

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:01.260 
independence of this it might get kind
of<00:02:59.470> tricky<00:02:59.620> so<00:03:00.190> what<00:03:00.310> I<00:03:00.340> recommend<00:03:00.580> is

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:01.270 
of tricky so what I recommend is

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:03.540 
of tricky so what I recommend is
starting<00:03:02.230> at<00:03:02.320> a<00:03:02.350> really<00:03:02.680> slow<00:03:02.950> tempo<00:03:03.370> and

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:03.550 
starting at a really slow tempo and

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:05.760 
starting at a really slow tempo and
working<00:03:03.880> your<00:03:03.970> way<00:03:04.030> up<00:03:04.150> really<00:03:05.140> concentrate

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:05.770 
working your way up really concentrate

00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:31.330 
working your way up really concentrate
on<00:03:05.800> building<00:03:06.700> control<00:03:07.330> and<00:03:07.540> independence

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:31.340 

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:33.560 

once<00:03:32.340> you<00:03:32.460> have<00:03:32.580> the<00:03:32.670> groove<00:03:32.910> down<00:03:33.090> up<00:03:33.300> to<00:03:33.420> this

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:33.570 
once you have the groove down up to this

00:03:33.570 --> 00:03:36.650 
once you have the groove down up to this
point<00:03:33.840> you<00:03:34.590> can<00:03:34.770> add<00:03:34.890> the<00:03:35.010> hi-hat<00:03:35.220> and<00:03:35.730> you<00:03:36.540> can

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:36.660 
point you can add the hi-hat and you can

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:38.600 
point you can add the hi-hat and you can
play<00:03:36.810> quarter<00:03:37.200> notes<00:03:37.230> on<00:03:37.710> the<00:03:37.890> downbeats<00:03:38.370> like

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:38.610 
play quarter notes on the downbeats like

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:57.140 
play quarter notes on the downbeats like
this<00:03:54.980> or<00:03:55.980> you<00:03:56.370> can<00:03:56.520> play<00:03:56.730> them<00:03:56.910> on<00:03:56.970> the

00:03:57.140 --> 00:03:57.150 
this or you can play them on the

00:03:57.150 --> 00:03:59.210 
this or you can play them on the
offbeat's<00:03:57.660> which<00:03:58.020> I<00:03:58.200> personally<00:03:58.500> find<00:03:58.770> more

00:03:59.210 --> 00:03:59.220 
offbeat's which I personally find more

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:18.729 
offbeat's which I personally find more
suitable<00:03:59.670> for<00:03:59.730> the<00:04:00.000> groove

00:04:18.729 --> 00:04:18.739 

00:04:18.739 --> 00:04:21.050 

you<00:04:19.739> can<00:04:19.889> play<00:04:20.070> this<00:04:20.220> rhythm<00:04:20.459> straight<00:04:20.910> or

00:04:21.050 --> 00:04:21.060 
you can play this rhythm straight or

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:24.200 
you can play this rhythm straight or
swung<00:04:21.740> now<00:04:22.740> personally<00:04:23.340> I<00:04:23.370> think<00:04:23.729> it's<00:04:23.880> at<00:04:24.060> its

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:24.210 
swung now personally I think it's at its

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:26.540 
swung now personally I think it's at its
prime<00:04:24.570> when<00:04:24.810> it's<00:04:24.990> swung<00:04:25.290> and<00:04:25.650> this<00:04:26.220> is<00:04:26.370> what<00:04:26.520> I

00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:26.550 
prime when it's swung and this is what I

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:28.909 
prime when it's swung and this is what I
mean<00:04:26.760> by<00:04:26.820> straight<00:04:27.270> and<00:04:27.419> swung<00:04:27.740> take<00:04:28.740> your

00:04:28.909 --> 00:04:28.919 
mean by straight and swung take your

00:04:28.919 --> 00:04:31.010 
mean by straight and swung take your
sixteenth<00:04:29.430> notes<00:04:29.729> and<00:04:30.060> play<00:04:30.419> them<00:04:30.630> evenly

00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:31.020 
sixteenth notes and play them evenly

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:32.930 
sixteenth notes and play them evenly
this<00:04:31.530> is<00:04:31.680> going<00:04:31.830> to<00:04:31.889> get<00:04:32.070> you<00:04:32.220> a<00:04:32.250> straight<00:04:32.639> feel

straight and then I'm going to play a

00:05:11.220 --> 00:05:33.860 
straight and then I'm going to play a
swung<00:05:32.210> so<00:05:33.210> let's<00:05:33.389> hear<00:05:33.479> what<00:05:33.630> the<00:05:33.720> whole

swung so let's hear what the whole

00:05:33.870 --> 00:05:35.600 
swung so let's hear what the whole
groove<00:05:34.169> sounds<00:05:34.560> like<00:05:34.680> when<00:05:34.860> it's<00:05:35.039> swung<00:05:35.370> as

00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:35.610 
groove sounds like when it's swung as

00:05:35.610 --> 00:05:37.430 
groove sounds like when it's swung as
opposed<00:05:35.940> to<00:05:36.180> straight<00:05:36.419> I'm<00:05:37.169> going<00:05:37.380> to

00:05:37.430 --> 00:05:37.440 
opposed to straight I'm going to

00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:39.920 
opposed to straight I'm going to
alternate<00:05:37.979> I'm<00:05:38.280> going<00:05:38.430> to<00:05:38.490> do<00:05:38.669> two<00:05:39.570> measures

00:05:39.920 --> 00:05:39.930 
alternate I'm going to do two measures

00:05:39.930 --> 00:05:41.779 
alternate I'm going to do two measures
of<00:05:40.110> straight<00:05:40.530> and<00:05:40.770> then<00:05:41.099> two<00:05:41.310> measures<00:05:41.610> of

00:05:41.779 --> 00:05:41.789 
of straight and then two measures of

00:05:41.789 --> 00:05:43.550 
of straight and then two measures of
swung<00:05:42.150> so<00:05:42.660> that<00:05:42.840> you<00:05:42.930> can<00:05:43.110> hear<00:05:43.289> what<00:05:43.440> the

00:05:43.550 --> 00:05:43.560 
swung so that you can hear what the

00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:54.290 
swung so that you can hear what the
difference<00:05:43.919> is

00:05:54.290 --> 00:05:54.300 

00:05:54.300 --> 00:06:13.499

00:06:16.090 --> 00:06:16.100 
after you master the groove feel free to

00:06:16.100 --> 00:06:18.370 
after you master the groove feel free to
experiment<00:06:16.610> with<00:06:16.970> it<00:06:17.180> start<00:06:17.900> by<00:06:18.050> putting<00:06:18.259> the

00:06:18.370 --> 00:06:18.380 
experiment with it start by putting the

00:06:18.380 --> 00:06:21.010 
experiment with it start by putting the
kick<00:06:18.650> in<00:06:18.800> different<00:06:19.130> places<00:06:19.370> and<00:06:20.090> decorate<00:06:20.870> it

00:06:21.010 --> 00:06:21.020 
kick in different places and decorate it

00:06:21.020 --> 00:06:23.529 
kick in different places and decorate it
with<00:06:21.050> fills<00:06:21.530> give<00:06:22.430> us<00:06:22.550> some<00:06:22.699> contrast<00:06:23.270> by

00:06:23.529 --> 00:06:23.539 
with fills give us some contrast by

00:06:23.539 --> 00:06:26.469 
with fills give us some contrast by
playing<00:06:23.810> different<00:06:24.229> grooves<00:06:24.440> around<00:06:24.680> it<00:06:25.479> well

00:06:26.469 --> 00:06:26.479 
playing different grooves around it well

00:06:26.479 --> 00:06:30.370 
playing different grooves around it well
good<00:06:27.020> luck<00:06:27.169> and<00:06:27.410> thanks<00:06:27.800> for<00:06:27.919> tuning<00:06:28.070> in
