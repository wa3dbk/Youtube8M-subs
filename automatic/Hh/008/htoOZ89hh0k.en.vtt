00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:57.010 
i guess you could use it when you were

00:01:57.010 --> 00:02:01.380 
i guess you could use it when you were
record<00:01:57.400> live<00:01:57.670> and<00:01:58.479> that<00:01:59.380> would<00:01:59.590> be<00:02:00.390> in

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:01.390 
record live and that would be in

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:03.149 
record live and that would be in
theaters<00:02:01.750> want<00:02:01.960> to<00:02:02.020> use<00:02:02.140> just<00:02:02.350> two<00:02:02.500> tracks<00:02:02.890> and

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:03.159 
theaters want to use just two tracks and

00:02:03.159 --> 00:02:06.960 
theaters want to use just two tracks and
you<00:02:03.460> want<00:02:03.670> to<00:02:03.760> record<00:02:04.060> live<00:02:04.360> so<00:02:05.640> you<00:02:06.640> got<00:02:06.820> the

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:10.989 
most time by using that now mt2 was the

00:02:10.989 --> 00:02:13.199 
most time by using that now mt2 was the
one<00:02:11.709> that<00:02:11.860> was<00:02:12.040> default<00:02:12.610> and<00:02:12.820> that's<00:02:12.910> the<00:02:13.060> one
