00:00:01.810 --> 00:00:07.210
 friends of youtube this is my first 

00:00:04.689 --> 00:00:12.650
 tutorial where I'll be 

00:00:07.210 --> 00:00:15.369
 teaching how to root your htc one is more 

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:18.020
 I had already tried with many others 

00:00:15.369 --> 00:00:20.150
 tutorials to try to remove it but 

00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:22.610
 none worked for me 

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:25.189
 after a long search I 

00:00:22.610 --> 00:00:27.349
 found an application that has 

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:29.779
 rooted my phone and it has been very 

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:32.680
 beneficial to me and I think that also 

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:36.640
 could you help them 

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:38.740
 what they will need is to download from 

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:41.970
 the prehistory totally free 

00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:45.150
 the router for 

00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:48.150
 check if your phone is blocked and 

00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:51.680
 supersur to give you access to what they are 

00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:51.680
 your applications that need it 

00:00:52.650 --> 00:01:00.230
 you are going to have to download from google 

00:00:56.810 --> 00:01:03.130
 this first application that is with the 

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:04.699
 who are going to pick up their phone 

00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:06.950
 is 

00:01:04.699 --> 00:01:09.829
 and well, they should only install 

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:13.150
 I do not do it because I already saw it in 

00:01:09.829 --> 00:01:16.060
 tared and if I give it is going to replace 

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:18.700
 but they only need this application 

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:20.530
 and downloading these files this is not 

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:24.190
 necessary only open it but 

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:28.520
 they come back and the days give and with this is that 

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:30.390
 they will be able to promote your phone 

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:33.650
 after what 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:33.650
 after she 

00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:39.980
 as this is here and when you give 

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:42.650
 the click 

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:44.620
 this application then she's going to 

00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:47.330
 restart your phone and it will root 

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:50.240
 I 've already done it so I do not know 

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:53.210
 restart the phone 

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:56.030
 but when the phone comes back again 

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:58.960
 tend only have to give 

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:58.960
 reuters 

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:02.950
 vidal to verify what he is going to say 

00:02:01.119 --> 00:02:05.490
 congratulations this device has 

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:05.490
 access 

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:11.990
 and then we will be able to do everything 

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:15.560
 they wanted to do 

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:21.160
 I hope this quick tutorial will 

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:21.160
 has been useful and please
