00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:13.370 
guys different techniques so today we're
going<00:00:10.950> to<00:00:11.040> focus<00:00:11.130> on<00:00:11.580> a<00:00:11.639> soft<00:00:12.210> cut<00:00:12.599> crease<00:00:12.929> so

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:13.380 
going to focus on a soft cut crease so

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:14.749 
going to focus on a soft cut crease so
it's<00:00:13.500> really<00:00:13.679> natural<00:00:13.950> but<00:00:14.370> if<00:00:14.490> you<00:00:14.610> have

00:00:14.749 --> 00:00:14.759 
it's really natural but if you have

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:16.129 
it's really natural but if you have
hooded<00:00:15.000> eyes<00:00:15.210> or<00:00:15.509> if<00:00:15.599> you<00:00:15.690> have<00:00:15.750> smaller

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:16.139 
hooded eyes or if you have smaller

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:18.380 
hooded eyes or if you have smaller
almond<00:00:16.560> shaped<00:00:16.800> eyes<00:00:16.890> as<00:00:17.310> i<00:00:17.490> do<00:00:17.550> then<00:00:18.180> this

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:18.390 
almond shaped eyes as i do then this

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:20.090 
almond shaped eyes as i do then this
look<00:00:18.570> is<00:00:18.720> perfect<00:00:18.990> whether<00:00:19.470> you<00:00:19.650> want<00:00:19.859> to<00:00:19.949> wear

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:20.100 
look is perfect whether you want to wear

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:22.070 
look is perfect whether you want to wear
it<00:00:20.130> everyday<00:00:20.520> for<00:00:20.670> a<00:00:20.970> work<00:00:21.150> or<00:00:21.390> when<00:00:21.840> you<00:00:21.960> go

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:22.080 
it everyday for a work or when you go

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:23.689 
it everyday for a work or when you go
out<00:00:22.320> at<00:00:22.529> night<00:00:22.560> because<00:00:22.949> it<00:00:23.189> actually<00:00:23.340> does

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:23.699 
out at night because it actually does

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:26.089 
out at night because it actually does
photograph<00:00:24.210> fairly<00:00:24.689> well<00:00:24.869> and<00:00:25.140> the<00:00:25.830> reason

00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:26.099 
photograph fairly well and the reason

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:27.950 
photograph fairly well and the reason
that<00:00:26.130> is<00:00:26.369> is<00:00:26.400> because<00:00:26.609> it<00:00:27.029> creates<00:00:27.390> more<00:00:27.630> depth

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:27.960 
that is is because it creates more depth

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:29.599 
that is is because it creates more depth
and<00:00:28.140> dimension<00:00:28.320> so<00:00:28.949> it<00:00:29.039> makes<00:00:29.189> your<00:00:29.400> eyes<00:00:29.580> look

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:29.609 
and dimension so it makes your eyes look

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:31.910 
and dimension so it makes your eyes look
deeper<00:00:30.300> set<00:00:30.660> and<00:00:30.990> it<00:00:31.289> can<00:00:31.380> also<00:00:31.529> make<00:00:31.769> them

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:31.920 
deeper set and it can also make them

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:34.880 
deeper set and it can also make them
larger<00:00:32.250> today<00:00:33.030> i<00:00:33.210> created<00:00:33.989> a<00:00:34.170> slightly<00:00:34.500> winged

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:34.890

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:39.560 
239 and I'm going to lift the lids just
so<00:02:37.230> I<00:02:37.290> can<00:02:37.350> see<00:02:37.800> exactly<00:02:38.490> where<00:02:38.730> my<00:02:38.850> crease<00:02:39.270> is

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:39.570

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:41.510 
so I can see exactly where my crease is
and<00:02:39.870> you<00:02:40.500> can<00:02:40.530> kind<00:02:40.770> of<00:02:40.890> play<00:02:41.160> with<00:02:41.190> it<00:02:41.340> a

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:41.520 
and you can kind of play with it a

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:42.950 
and you can kind of play with it a
little<00:02:41.550> bit<00:02:41.760> just<00:02:42.120> push<00:02:42.390> it<00:02:42.420> into<00:02:42.720> the<00:02:42.870> eye

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:42.960 
little bit just push it into the eye

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:47.120 
little bit just push it into the eye
socket<00:02:43.710> and<00:02:44.990> my<00:02:45.990> eyelid<00:02:46.380> and<00:02:46.500> my<00:02:46.620> crease<00:02:46.950> are

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:47.130 
socket and my eyelid and my crease are

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:50.360 
socket and my eyelid and my crease are
about<00:02:47.550> the<00:02:47.820> same<00:02:48.030> area<00:02:48.800> so<00:02:49.800> I'm<00:02:49.860> just<00:02:50.070> going<00:02:50.280> to

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:50.370 
about the same area so I'm just going to

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:53.210 
about the same area so I'm just going to
gently<00:02:50.700> trace<00:02:51.390> that<00:02:51.750> and<00:02:52.260> you<00:02:52.860> don't<00:02:53.040> want<00:02:53.160> to

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:53.220 
gently trace that and you don't want to

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:54.800 
gently trace that and you don't want to
use<00:02:53.340> too<00:02:53.670> much<00:02:53.880> of<00:02:54.120> this<00:02:54.240> because<00:02:54.630> this<00:02:54.750> is

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:54.810 
use too much of this because this is

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:57.320 
use too much of this because this is
going<00:02:55.050> to<00:02:55.200> be<00:02:55.290> the<00:02:55.440> deepest<00:02:55.980> part<00:02:56.520> of<00:02:56.790> the<00:02:57.300> eye

00:02:57.320 --> 00:02:57.330 
going to be the deepest part of the eye

00:02:57.330 --> 00:02:59.450 
going to be the deepest part of the eye
look<00:02:57.780> and<00:02:57.990> that's<00:02:58.710> why<00:02:58.920> we're<00:02:59.100> using<00:02:59.250> the

00:02:59.450 --> 00:02:59.460 
look and that's why we're using the

00:02:59.460 --> 00:03:01.130 
look and that's why we're using the
darkest<00:02:59.910> color<00:03:00.120> but<00:03:00.450> that<00:03:00.570> doesn't<00:03:00.870> mean<00:03:01.020> you

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:01.140 
darkest color but that doesn't mean you

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:03.800 
darkest color but that doesn't mean you
should<00:03:01.320> apply<00:03:01.890> it<00:03:01.950> all<00:03:02.220> over<00:03:02.280> the<00:03:02.880> eye<00:03:02.910> because

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:03.810 
should apply it all over the eye because

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:05.960 
should apply it all over the eye because
a<00:03:04.020> soft<00:03:04.440> cut<00:03:04.830> crease<00:03:05.130> is<00:03:05.370> actually<00:03:05.940> very

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:05.970 
a soft cut crease is actually very

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:08.650 
a soft cut crease is actually very
pretty<00:03:06.510> and<00:03:06.750> it<00:03:07.650> defines<00:03:07.950> the<00:03:08.220> eye<00:03:08.250> without

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:08.660 
pretty and it defines the eye without

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:10.730 
pretty and it defines the eye without
overwhelming<00:03:09.660> it<00:03:09.750> with<00:03:09.960> color<00:03:10.230> if<00:03:10.530> you're

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:10.740 
overwhelming it with color if you're

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:12.770 
overwhelming it with color if you're
looking<00:03:11.040> to<00:03:11.280> elongate<00:03:11.820> the<00:03:12.270> shape<00:03:12.540> of<00:03:12.750> your

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:12.780 
looking to elongate the shape of your

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:14.990 
looking to elongate the shape of your
eye<00:03:12.930> you<00:03:13.830> can<00:03:13.980> go<00:03:14.130> ahead<00:03:14.250> and<00:03:14.400> drag<00:03:14.730> it<00:03:14.910> out

00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:15.000 
eye you can go ahead and drag it out

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:16.520 
eye you can go ahead and drag it out
just<00:03:15.150> a<00:03:15.300> little<00:03:15.330> bit<00:03:15.570> just<00:03:16.170> make<00:03:16.320> sure<00:03:16.350> that

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:16.530 
just a little bit just make sure that

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:18.350 
just a little bit just make sure that
you<00:03:16.770> drag<00:03:17.010> it<00:03:17.040> out<00:03:17.280> a<00:03:17.310> little<00:03:17.640> extra<00:03:17.880> than<00:03:18.239> you

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:18.360 
you drag it out a little extra than you

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:20.390 
you drag it out a little extra than you
normally<00:03:18.510> would<00:03:18.810> because<00:03:19.530> we<00:03:19.770> want<00:03:20.250> to
