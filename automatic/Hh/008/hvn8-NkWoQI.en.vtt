00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:02.899

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:11.010 
well and win the game and that we

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:13.330 
well and win the game and that we
weren't<00:00:11.250> quite<00:00:11.519> where<00:00:12.000> we<00:00:12.150> needed<00:00:12.360> to<00:00:12.570> be<00:00:12.750> so

00:00:13.330 --> 00:00:13.340 
weren't quite where we needed to be so

00:00:13.340 --> 00:00:16.279 
weren't quite where we needed to be so
yeah<00:00:14.340> the<00:00:14.880> Warrington<00:00:15.269> would<00:00:15.540> just<00:00:15.900> on<00:00:16.139> the

00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:16.289 
yeah the Warrington would just on the

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:17.390 
yeah the Warrington would just on the
bottom<00:00:16.470> today<00:00:16.770> I<00:00:16.890> thought<00:00:17.190> they<00:00:17.340> were

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:17.400 
bottom today I thought they were

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:21.310 
bottom today I thought they were
excellent<00:00:17.730> and<00:00:18.020> had<00:00:19.020> too<00:00:19.230> much<00:00:19.380> intent<00:00:19.859> for<00:00:20.070> us

00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:21.320 
excellent and had too much intent for us

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:26.300 
excellent and had too much intent for us
we<00:00:22.320> look<00:00:22.920> like<00:00:23.160> we<00:00:24.029> had<00:00:24.150> a<00:00:24.180> week<00:00:24.840> off<00:00:25.050> next<00:00:25.410> week

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:26.310 
we look like we had a week off next week

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:27.740 
we look like we had a week off next week
and<00:00:26.550> they<00:00:26.640> look<00:00:26.820> like<00:00:26.939> that<00:00:27.180> something<00:00:27.630> to

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:27.750 
and they look like that something to

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:29.390 
and they look like that something to
really<00:00:27.990> build<00:00:28.199> towards<00:00:28.650> which<00:00:28.800> I<00:00:28.949> thought<00:00:29.279> it

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:29.400 
really build towards which I thought it

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:31.609 
really build towards which I thought it
might<00:00:29.550> be<00:00:29.580> the<00:00:29.670> other<00:00:29.789> way<00:00:30.000> around<00:00:30.029> but<00:00:30.619> yeah

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:31.619 
might be the other way around but yeah

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:35.299 
might be the other way around but yeah
so<00:00:31.800> it<00:00:31.890> was<00:00:31.980> disappointing<00:00:32.579> that<00:00:33.800> our<00:00:34.800> effort

00:00:35.299 --> 00:00:35.309 
so it was disappointing that our effort

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:38.060 
so it was disappointing that our effort
and<00:00:35.460> commitment<00:00:36.090> was<00:00:36.630> way<00:00:37.050> way<00:00:37.410> off<00:00:37.440> where<00:00:38.040> it

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:38.070 
and commitment was way way off where it

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:41.720 
and commitment was way way off where it
usually<00:00:38.700> is<00:00:39.000> and<00:00:39.360> we<00:00:40.050> need<00:00:40.200> to<00:00:40.320> get<00:00:40.469> the<00:00:40.730> two

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:41.730 
usually is and we need to get the two

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:44.119 
usually is and we need to get the two
groups<00:00:41.940> on<00:00:42.120> that<00:00:42.300> pretty<00:00:42.480> quickly<00:00:42.920> before<00:00:43.920> our

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:44.129 
groups on that pretty quickly before our

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:47.420 
groups on that pretty quickly before our
next<00:00:44.280> game<00:00:45.230> but<00:00:46.230> I'll<00:00:46.620> take<00:00:46.980> anything<00:00:47.250> away

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430 
next game but I'll take anything away

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:50.209 
next game but I'll take anything away
from<00:00:47.520> Warrington<00:00:48.649> that<00:00:49.649> I<00:00:49.680> thought<00:00:49.890> they<00:00:50.010> were

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219 
from Warrington that I thought they were

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:52.459

that<00:02:05.489> I<00:02:05.759> think<00:02:06.239> there<00:02:06.360> might<00:02:06.450> have<00:02:06.509> eight<00:02:06.689> as

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:06.840 
that I think there might have eight as

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:08.539 
that I think there might have eight as
were<00:02:06.989> twelve<00:02:07.229> men<00:02:07.409> to<00:02:07.560> be<00:02:07.679> honest<00:02:07.890> today

00:02:59.839 --> 00:02:59.849 
said I'm not sure it would have made any

00:02:59.849 --> 00:03:01.699 
said I'm not sure it would have made any
difference<00:02:59.970> today<00:03:00.630> cuz<00:03:00.870> we<00:03:01.019> were<00:03:01.139> just<00:03:01.349> we

00:03:01.699 --> 00:03:01.709 
difference today cuz we were just we

00:03:01.709 --> 00:03:04.159 
difference today cuz we were just we
were<00:03:01.739> just<00:03:01.950> so<00:03:02.130> far<00:03:02.160> off<00:03:02.669> and<00:03:02.880> to<00:03:03.630> many<00:03:03.870> of<00:03:04.019> our

00:03:04.159 --> 00:03:04.169 
were just so far off and to many of our

00:03:04.169 --> 00:03:05.809 
were just so far off and to many of our
players<00:03:04.590> individually<00:03:04.919> and<00:03:05.489> obviously

00:03:05.809 --> 00:03:05.819 
players individually and obviously

00:03:05.819 --> 00:03:08.780 
players individually and obviously
collectively<00:03:06.450> we<00:03:06.720> were<00:03:06.870> we<00:03:07.739> were<00:03:07.859> just<00:03:08.040> really

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:08.790 
collectively we were we were just really

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:11.300 
collectively we were we were just really
shabby<00:03:09.269> today<00:03:09.690> I<00:03:09.900> thought<00:03:10.230> defensively<00:03:10.680> we

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:11.310 
shabby today I thought defensively we

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:14.569 
shabby today I thought defensively we
were<00:03:11.430> poor<00:03:12.019> and<00:03:13.019> that<00:03:13.590> impacted<00:03:14.250> on<00:03:14.400> our

00:03:14.569 --> 00:03:14.579 
were poor and that impacted on our

00:03:14.579 --> 00:03:16.610 
were poor and that impacted on our
ability<00:03:14.849> to<00:03:15.180> play<00:03:15.389> the<00:03:15.569> game<00:03:15.750> you<00:03:16.349> know<00:03:16.470> they

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:16.620 
ability to play the game you know they

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:18.319 
ability to play the game you know they
did<00:03:16.829> towards<00:03:17.190> what<00:03:17.340> we<00:03:17.430> wanted<00:03:17.730> to<00:03:17.849> do<00:03:17.970> to<00:03:18.150> them

00:03:18.319 --> 00:03:18.329 
did towards what we wanted to do to them

00:03:18.329 --> 00:03:20.089 
did towards what we wanted to do to them
and<00:03:18.540> they<00:03:18.870> were<00:03:18.959> very<00:03:19.139> good<00:03:19.319> at<00:03:19.440> it<00:03:19.470> thought

00:03:20.089 --> 00:03:20.099 
and they were very good at it thought

00:03:20.099 --> 00:03:21.740 
and they were very good at it thought
there<00:03:20.310> aft<00:03:20.519> Bucks<00:03:20.760> were<00:03:20.940> very<00:03:21.120> good<00:03:21.329> their

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:21.750 
there aft Bucks were very good their

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:23.890 
there aft Bucks were very good their
fault<00:03:22.019> pack<00:03:22.290> just<00:03:22.590> cleaned<00:03:22.829> that<00:03:23.040> was<00:03:23.190> up<00:03:23.340> and

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:23.900 
fault pack just cleaned that was up and

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:27.770 
fault pack just cleaned that was up and
it<00:03:24.900> was<00:03:25.019> a<00:03:25.049> pretty<00:03:26.150> complete<00:03:27.150> performance

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:27.780 
it was a pretty complete performance

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:29.629 
it was a pretty complete performance
from<00:03:27.989> them<00:03:28.169> I<00:03:28.260> thought<00:03:28.440> they<00:03:28.500> the<00:03:29.160> role<00:03:29.340> does

00:03:29.629 --> 00:03:29.639 
from them I thought they the role does

00:03:29.639 --> 00:03:32.020 
from them I thought they the role does
in<00:03:29.849> in<00:03:30.150> every<00:03:30.359> department

00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:32.030 
in in every department

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:34.750 
in in every department
I<00:03:32.060> know<00:03:32.750> I<00:03:32.780> think<00:03:33.740> probably<00:03:34.130> most<00:03:34.400> of<00:03:34.640> our

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:34.760 
I know I think probably most of our

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:36.820 
I know I think probably most of our
bodies<00:03:35.120> were<00:03:35.300> worth<00:03:35.960> to<00:03:36.170> be<00:03:36.290> honest<00:03:36.560> not

00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:36.830 
bodies were worth to be honest not

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:39.070 
bodies were worth to be honest not
junior<00:03:37.250> miles<00:03:37.490> come<00:03:37.730> on<00:03:37.850> and<00:03:38.000> did<00:03:38.150> a<00:03:38.180> did<00:03:39.050> a

00:03:39.070 --> 00:03:39.080 
junior miles come on and did a did a

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:43.990 
junior miles come on and did a did a
pretty<00:03:39.800> good<00:03:39.980> job<00:03:41.920> no<00:03:42.920> I<00:03:42.950> think<00:03:43.490> it's<00:03:43.760> pretty

00:03:43.990 --> 00:03:44.000 
pretty good job no I think it's pretty

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.060 
pretty good job no I think it's pretty
hard<00:03:44.090> to<00:03:44.210> take<00:03:44.420> any<00:03:44.630> positives<00:03:45.110> from<00:03:45.260> that<00:03:45.500> and

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:46.070 
hard to take any positives from that and

00:03:46.070 --> 00:03:48.220 
hard to take any positives from that and
positives<00:03:46.730> are<00:03:46.970> we've<00:03:47.210> got<00:03:47.450> a<00:03:47.480> week<00:03:47.690> off<00:03:47.900> next

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:48.230 
positives are we've got a week off next

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:50.440 
positives are we've got a week off next
week<00:03:48.320> and<00:03:48.770> but<00:03:49.730> I'm<00:03:49.820> not<00:03:49.940> sure<00:03:50.120> that<00:03:50.300> helps

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:50.450 
week and but I'm not sure that helps

00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:52.780 
week and but I'm not sure that helps
really<00:03:50.900> maybe<00:03:51.770> that's<00:03:52.010> the<00:03:52.130> reason<00:03:52.280> why<00:03:52.580> I'm

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:52.790 
really maybe that's the reason why I'm

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:56.580 
really maybe that's the reason why I'm
sad<00:03:53.660> to<00:03:53.810> say<00:03:54.020> but<00:03:54.230> you<00:03:54.950> know<00:03:55.040> we've<00:03:55.490> got<00:03:55.700> to
