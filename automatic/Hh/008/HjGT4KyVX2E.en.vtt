Greek modes okay

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:45.350 
Greek modes okay
these<00:00:43.559> are<00:00:43.800> modes<00:00:44.040> passed<00:00:44.610> down<00:00:44.910> to<00:00:45.149> us<00:00:45.329> from

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:45.360 
these are modes passed down to us from

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:47.389 
these are modes passed down to us from
Pythagoras<00:00:45.989> this<00:00:46.500> time<00:00:46.770> right

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:47.399 
Pythagoras this time right

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:49.369 
Pythagoras this time right
Pythagoras<00:00:48.149> wasn't<00:00:48.600> just<00:00:48.809> by<00:00:48.960> the<00:00:49.020> way<00:00:49.140> it

00:00:49.369 --> 00:00:49.379 
Pythagoras wasn't just by the way it

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:51.350 
Pythagoras wasn't just by the way it
wasn't<00:00:49.590> just<00:00:49.890> a<00:00:49.980> mathematician<00:00:50.340> it<00:00:51.180> was<00:00:51.329> a

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360 
wasn't just a mathematician it was a

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:53.240 
wasn't just a mathematician it was a
musician<00:00:51.840> which<00:00:52.379> tells<00:00:52.680> you<00:00:52.829> a<00:00:52.890> little<00:00:53.129> bit

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
musician which tells you a little bit

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:55.580 
musician which tells you a little bit
about<00:00:53.430> music<00:00:54.030> it's<00:00:54.329> all<00:00:54.539> math<00:00:54.780> based<00:00:55.110> right

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
about music it's all math based right

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:58.310 
about music it's all math based right
which<00:00:56.340> is<00:00:56.520> bad<00:00:57.090> for<00:00:57.420> people<00:00:57.600> who<00:00:57.960> are<00:00:58.079> bad<00:00:58.289> at

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
which is bad for people who are bad at

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:01.549 
which is bad for people who are bad at
math<00:00:58.620> like<00:00:58.949> me<00:00:59.160> but<00:00:59.460> it's<00:00:59.969> actually<00:01:00.480> good<00:01:00.780> if

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559 
math like me but it's actually good if

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:04.100 
math like me but it's actually good if
you're<00:01:01.920> not<00:01:01.949> so<00:01:02.430> good<00:01:02.579> at<00:01:02.640> math<00:01:02.910> playing<00:01:03.660> music

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
you're not so good at math playing music

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:06.789 
you're not so good at math playing music
really<00:01:04.500> helps<00:01:04.680> out<00:01:05.159> your<00:01:05.369> math<00:01:05.610> jobs<00:01:06.030> okay

00:01:06.789 --> 00:01:06.799 
really helps out your math jobs okay

00:01:06.799 --> 00:01:08.899 
really helps out your math jobs okay
alright<00:01:07.799> so<00:01:07.830> how<00:01:08.340> do<00:01:08.400> you<00:01:08.520> figure<00:01:08.670> out<00:01:08.820> a

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909 
alright so how do you figure out a

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:11.450 
alright so how do you figure out a
Dorian<00:01:09.330> scale<00:01:09.479> well<00:01:10.140> let's<00:01:10.500> just<00:01:10.799> say<00:01:11.040> we're

supplies

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:57.240 

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:02.240 

that's<00:01:58.170> it<00:01:59.630> simple<00:02:00.630> huh<00:02:00.860> take<00:02:01.860> the<00:02:02.040> major

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:02.250 
that's it simple huh take the major

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:04.910 
that's it simple huh take the major
scale<00:02:02.670> go<00:02:03.659> to<00:02:03.720> the<00:02:03.840> second<00:02:04.229> scale<00:02:04.409> degree<00:02:04.470> and

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:04.920 
scale go to the second scale degree and

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:06.950 
scale go to the second scale degree and
boom<00:02:05.130> you're<00:02:05.340> there<00:02:05.369> right<00:02:05.940> here's<00:02:06.840> another

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:06.960 
boom you're there right here's another

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:09.380 
boom you're there right here's another
one<00:02:07.260> let's<00:02:07.860> say<00:02:08.039> we're<00:02:08.190> in<00:02:08.280> the<00:02:08.369> key<00:02:08.399> of<00:02:08.580> E<00:02:08.850> he

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:09.390 
one let's say we're in the key of E he

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:12.860 
one let's say we're in the key of E he
has<00:02:09.630> how<00:02:09.899> many<00:02:09.959> sharps<00:02:11.240> what<00:02:12.240> that's<00:02:12.569> right

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:12.870 
has how many sharps what that's right

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:16.070 
has how many sharps what that's right
four<00:02:13.290> sharps<00:02:13.770> very<00:02:14.100> good<00:02:14.370> right<00:02:14.880> on<00:02:15.090> one<00:02:15.930> of

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:16.080 
four sharps very good right on one of

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:18.050 
four sharps very good right on one of
those<00:02:16.290> one<00:02:16.830> of<00:02:16.860> those<00:02:17.100> key<00:02:17.340> signatures<00:02:17.880> I

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:18.060 
those one of those key signatures I

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:20.600 
those one of those key signatures I
think<00:02:18.600> that's<00:02:18.780> great<00:02:19.130> let's<00:02:20.130> check<00:02:20.370> it<00:02:20.489> out

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:20.610 
think that's great let's check it out
