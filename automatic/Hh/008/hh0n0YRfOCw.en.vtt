then<00:00:44.830> is<00:00:45.570> the<00:00:46.570> private<00:00:47.110> symbol<00:00:48.360> which<00:00:49.360> is<00:00:49.780> this

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:50.650 
then is the private symbol which is this

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:52.380 
then is the private symbol which is this
symbol<00:00:51.040> right<00:00:51.160> here<00:00:51.220> and<00:00:51.700> that's<00:00:52.030> going<00:00:52.120> to<00:00:52.240> go

00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:52.390 
symbol right here and that's going to go

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:55.410 
symbol right here and that's going to go
right<00:00:52.660> here<00:00:52.870> to<00:00:53.020> make<00:00:53.320> the<00:00:54.030> upper<00:00:55.030> part<00:00:55.300> of<00:00:55.360> the

eye next is a 3 rounded it's the three
two<00:01:02.980> trout<00:01:03.190> and<00:01:03.460> then<00:01:03.610> I<00:01:03.730> rotated<00:01:04.329> it<00:01:04.629> to<00:01:05.109> make

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:05.950 
two trout and then I rotated it to make

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:12.360 
two trout and then I rotated it to make
it<00:01:05.979> look<00:01:06.100> like<00:01:06.219> eyes

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:12.370 

00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:15.580 

next<00:01:13.370> is<00:01:13.610> another<00:01:13.970> 3<00:01:14.240> rounded<00:01:14.720> this<00:01:15.320> time

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:15.590 
next is another 3 rounded this time

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:21.040 
next is another 3 rounded this time
underneath<00:01:16.250> that<00:01:16.610> one<00:01:17.050> say<00:01:18.050> to<00:01:18.770> put<00:01:19.310> the<00:01:20.050> bags

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:21.050

underneath that one say to put the bags
under<00:01:21.260> his<00:01:21.440> eyes<00:01:22.930> then<00:01:23.930> the<00:01:24.560> grins<00:01:24.920> are<00:01:26.770> going

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:27.770 
under his eyes then the grins are going

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:35.640 
under his eyes then the grins are going
to<00:01:27.890> be<00:01:29.710> right<00:01:30.710> here<00:01:33.729> just<00:01:34.729> rotate<00:01:34.910> it<00:01:35.210> slightly

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:35.650 
to be right here just rotate it slightly

00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:39.820 
to be right here just rotate it slightly
then<00:01:36.650> another<00:01:36.890> grin<00:01:37.870> right<00:01:38.870> here<00:01:39.200> same<00:01:39.530> color

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:39.830 
then another grin right here same color

then another grin right here same color
rotate<00:01:40.520> it<00:01:40.640> slightly<00:01:41.920> then<00:01:42.920> another<00:01:43.130> 3

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:43.550 
rotate it slightly then another 3

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:48.010 
rotate it slightly then another 3
rounded<00:01:45.130> which<00:01:46.130> is<00:01:46.310> at<00:01:46.460> three<00:01:46.790> and<00:01:47.270> it<00:01:47.869> goes

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:48.020 
rounded which is at three and it goes

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:49.780 
rounded which is at three and it goes
here<00:01:48.350> to<00:01:48.470> cover<00:01:48.650> up<00:01:48.890> the<00:01:49.160> next<00:01:49.369> part<00:01:49.610> of<00:01:49.700> the

here to cover up the next part of the

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:55.570 
here to cover up the next part of the
mouth<00:01:51.759> then<00:01:52.759> a<00:01:52.790> multi<00:01:53.390> pointed<00:01:53.840> store<00:01:54.580> now

00:01:55.570 --> 00:01:55.580 
mouth then a multi pointed store now

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:57.670 
mouth then a multi pointed store now
this<00:01:55.820> looks<00:01:56.180> like<00:01:56.479> and<00:01:57.170> get<00:01:57.410> you<00:01:57.500> a<00:01:57.560> better

I'm sorry onto the circle then is the
circle<00:02:17.230> which<00:02:17.350> makes<00:02:17.590> the<00:02:17.709> head<00:02:18.600> you<00:02:19.600> make<00:02:19.810> as

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:19.930 
circle which makes the head you make as

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:23.000 
circle which makes the head you make as
big<00:02:19.959> or<00:02:20.380> as<00:02:20.440> small<00:02:20.500> as<00:02:20.830> you<00:02:20.890> want<00:02:20.920> and<00:02:21.430> then

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:27.640 
finally is the bio symbol which let me

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:28.980 
finally is the bio symbol which let me
bring<00:02:27.790> that<00:02:27.970> up<00:02:28.000> just<00:02:28.150> to<00:02:28.480> show<00:02:28.660> you<00:02:28.720> all<00:02:28.870> what

bring that up just to show you all what

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:35.490 
bring that up just to show you all what
it<00:02:29.080> looks<00:02:29.260> like<00:02:29.410> in<00:02:29.560> case<00:02:29.740> you<00:02:29.860> don't<00:02:30.010> know<00:02:34.500> if

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:35.500 
it looks like in case you don't know if

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:37.260 
it looks like in case you don't know if

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:37.270 
you can see that pretty much you know

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:41.010 
you can see that pretty much you know
what<00:02:37.360> I<00:02:37.480> biosimilars<00:02:38.110> I'm<00:02:38.230> sure<00:02:38.820> and<00:02:40.020> finally

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:41.020 
what I biosimilars I'm sure and finally

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:44.360 
what I biosimilars I'm sure and finally
you<00:02:41.050> make<00:02:41.350> sure<00:02:41.500> it's<00:02:41.709> behind<00:02:41.950> everything<00:02:42.519> I

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:44.370 
you make sure it's behind everything I

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:46.440 
you make sure it's behind everything I
kind<00:02:45.370> of<00:02:45.430> screw<00:02:45.580> them<00:02:45.730> up<00:02:45.790> here<00:02:46.030> but<00:02:46.209> you<00:02:46.390> get

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:46.450 
kind of screw them up here but you get

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:49.580 
kind of screw them up here but you get
the<00:02:46.510> point<00:02:46.810> and<00:02:47.320> you're<00:02:47.950> going<00:02:48.070> to<00:02:48.130> have<00:02:48.310> to<00:02:48.459> be
