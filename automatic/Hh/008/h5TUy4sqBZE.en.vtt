and<00:00:00.659> what<00:00:00.780> I<00:00:00.810> want<00:00:01.170> to<00:00:01.260> get<00:00:01.500> flavor<00:00:01.860> into<00:00:02.340> the

00:00:02.480 --> 00:00:02.490 
and what I want to get flavor into the

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:04.970 
and what I want to get flavor into the
rice<00:00:02.669> is<00:00:02.970> the<00:00:03.120> onion<00:00:03.480> to<00:00:03.659> be<00:00:03.840> nice<00:00:04.440> and<00:00:04.740> sort<00:00:04.920> of

00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:04.980 
rice is the onion to be nice and sort of

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:08.810 
rice is the onion to be nice and sort of
toasted<00:00:05.580> and<00:00:06.410> caramelized<00:00:07.410> now<00:00:08.040> if<00:00:08.280> you<00:00:08.519> if

00:00:08.810 --> 00:00:08.820 
toasted and caramelized now if you if

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:11.180 
toasted and caramelized now if you if
you<00:00:09.030> want<00:00:09.240> to<00:00:09.360> do<00:00:09.750> without<00:00:09.870> the<00:00:10.200> onion<00:00:10.559> I<00:00:10.740> would

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:11.190 
you want to do without the onion I would

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:12.680 
you want to do without the onion I would
still<00:00:11.429> suggest<00:00:11.639> you<00:00:12.000> have<00:00:12.150> a<00:00:12.179> little<00:00:12.450> bit<00:00:12.570> of

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:12.690 
still suggest you have a little bit of

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:14.539 
still suggest you have a little bit of
oil<00:00:12.840> because<00:00:13.530> it<00:00:13.650> does<00:00:13.799> help<00:00:14.070> to<00:00:14.130> keep<00:00:14.370> the

00:00:14.539 --> 00:00:14.549 
oil because it does help to keep the

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:17.480 
oil because it does help to keep the
grains<00:00:14.790> separate<00:00:15.389> now<00:00:16.320> cooking<00:00:16.830> perfect<00:00:17.279> rice

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:17.490 
grains separate now cooking perfect rice

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:20.870 
grains separate now cooking perfect rice
is<00:00:17.789> very<00:00:18.150> very<00:00:18.449> easy<00:00:19.130> provided<00:00:20.130> you<00:00:20.460> know<00:00:20.490> what

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:20.880 
is very very easy provided you know what

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:24.230 
is very very easy provided you know what
the<00:00:21.000> rules<00:00:21.240> are<00:00:21.480> so<00:00:22.289> number<00:00:22.619> one<00:00:22.830> is<00:00:23.100> it's<00:00:23.850> best

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:24.240 
the rules are so number one is it's best

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:27.140 
the rules are so number one is it's best
I<00:00:24.480> always<00:00:24.840> think<00:00:25.109> to<00:00:25.199> use<00:00:25.529> a<00:00:25.740> wide<00:00:26.099> prying<00:00:26.849> pan

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:27.150 
I always think to use a wide prying pan

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:30.410 
I always think to use a wide prying pan
and<00:00:27.529> it<00:00:28.529> needs<00:00:28.859> to<00:00:29.010> have<00:00:29.279> a<00:00:29.460> lid<00:00:29.730> now<00:00:30.210> this

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:30.420 
and it needs to have a lid now this

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:33.440 
and it needs to have a lid now this
frying<00:00:30.720> pan<00:00:30.840> actually<00:00:31.500> has<00:00:31.740> its<00:00:32.099> own<00:00:32.309> lid<00:00:32.669> but

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:33.450 
frying pan actually has its own lid but

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:35.000 
frying pan actually has its own lid but
if<00:00:33.719> you<00:00:33.899> haven't<00:00:34.170> got<00:00:34.290> a<00:00:34.320> frying<00:00:34.590> pan<00:00:34.680> with<00:00:34.829> a

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.010 
if you haven't got a frying pan with a

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:36.620 
if you haven't got a frying pan with a
lid<00:00:35.250> if<00:00:35.399> you<00:00:35.489> dig<00:00:35.700> about<00:00:35.820> in<00:00:36.149> your<00:00:36.329> saucepan

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:36.630 
lid if you dig about in your saucepan

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:38.780 
lid if you dig about in your saucepan
cupboard<00:00:37.200> you<00:00:37.620> can<00:00:37.739> probably<00:00:37.920> find<00:00:38.280> one<00:00:38.610> that

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:38.790 
cupboard you can probably find one that

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:41.209 
cupboard you can probably find one that
will<00:00:38.910> fit<00:00:39.149> a<00:00:39.329> frying<00:00:39.690> pan<00:00:39.780> but<00:00:40.170> this<00:00:40.739> shallow

00:00:41.209 --> 00:00:41.219 
will fit a frying pan but this shallow

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:44.090 
will fit a frying pan but this shallow
pan<00:00:41.670> is<00:00:42.000> very<00:00:42.300> important<00:00:43.020> because<00:00:43.290> it<00:00:43.710> keeps

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
pan is very important because it keeps

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:47.029 
pan is very important because it keeps
the<00:00:44.399> grain<00:00:44.610> separate<00:00:45.210> rule<00:00:46.170> number<00:00:46.410> two<00:00:46.770> is

00:00:47.029 --> 00:00:47.039 
the grain separate rule number two is

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:49.729 
the grain separate rule number two is
always<00:00:47.610> measure<00:00:48.030> the<00:00:48.300> rice<00:00:48.510> by<00:00:48.930> volume<00:00:49.469> and

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
always measure the rice by volume and

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:52.670 
always measure the rice by volume and
not<00:00:50.100> by<00:00:50.430> weight<00:00:50.730> because<00:00:51.690> the<00:00:51.840> correct<00:00:52.199> amount

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
not by weight because the correct amount

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:55.910 
not by weight because the correct amount
of<00:00:52.890> liquid<00:00:53.430> is<00:00:53.670> twice<00:00:54.390> the<00:00:54.930> volume<00:00:55.079> so<00:00:55.860> you

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
of liquid is twice the volume so you

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:58.160 
of liquid is twice the volume so you
measure<00:00:56.309> the<00:00:56.460> rice<00:00:56.789> in<00:00:57.090> a<00:00:57.210> measuring<00:00:57.629> jug<00:00:57.899> and

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
measure the rice in a measuring jug and

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:00.770 
measure the rice in a measuring jug and
you<00:00:59.010> need<00:00:59.190> about<00:00:59.430> two<00:00:59.760> and<00:00:59.820> a<00:00:59.879> half<00:00:59.940> ounces<00:01:00.570> per

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
you need about two and a half ounces per

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:03.619 
you need about two and a half ounces per
person<00:01:01.289> I've<00:01:01.410> got<00:01:01.739> ten<00:01:02.370> ounces<00:01:03.030> here<00:01:03.270> so<00:01:03.480> it's

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629 
person I've got ten ounces here so it's

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:06.469 
person I've got ten ounces here so it's
up<00:01:03.840> to<00:01:04.049> the<00:01:04.170> 10<00:01:04.350> ounce<00:01:04.500> measure<00:01:04.949> and<00:01:05.299> then<00:01:06.299> you

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
up to the 10 ounce measure and then you

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:09.950 
up to the 10 ounce measure and then you
use<00:01:06.780> twice<00:01:07.260> that<00:01:07.650> of<00:01:07.950> liquid<00:01:08.700> so<00:01:09.420> measure<00:01:09.750> by

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960 
use twice that of liquid so measure by

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:11.840 
use twice that of liquid so measure by
volume<00:01:10.380> and<00:01:10.530> always<00:01:10.890> use<00:01:11.100> twice<00:01:11.490> the<00:01:11.760> amount

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
volume and always use twice the amount

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:14.149 
volume and always use twice the amount
of<00:01:12.060> liquid<00:01:12.510> to<00:01:12.689> the<00:01:12.900> rice<00:01:13.080> this<00:01:13.920> will<00:01:14.070> be

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:14.159 
of liquid to the rice this will be

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:15.740 
of liquid to the rice this will be
enough<00:01:14.340> for<00:01:14.369> four<00:01:14.700> people<00:01:14.909> so<00:01:15.360> I'm<00:01:15.509> going<00:01:15.689> to

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
enough for four people so I'm going to

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:23.210 
enough for four people so I'm going to
put<00:01:15.869> the<00:01:15.960> rice<00:01:16.140> in<00:01:16.380> the<00:01:16.409> pan<00:01:21.920> what<00:01:22.920> that<00:01:23.100> little

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:23.220 
put the rice in the pan what that little

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:27.670 
put the rice in the pan what that little
bit<00:01:23.430> of<00:01:23.520> oil<00:01:23.759> does<00:01:24.119> is<00:01:24.659> as<00:01:24.869> you<00:01:24.900> move<00:01:25.259> it<00:01:25.470> around

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:27.680 

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:31.850 

each<00:01:28.680> grain<00:01:29.189> gets<00:01:29.850> just<00:01:30.390> a<00:01:30.479> very<00:01:30.689> very<00:01:30.860> faint

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 
each grain gets just a very very faint

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:34.490 
each grain gets just a very very faint
smidgen<00:01:32.549> of<00:01:32.670> oil<00:01:32.880> and<00:01:33.180> this<00:01:33.659> helps<00:01:34.229> to<00:01:34.350> keep

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
smidgen of oil and this helps to keep

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:39.649 
smidgen of oil and this helps to keep
the<00:01:34.710> grains<00:01:34.950> separate<00:01:38.000> so<00:01:39.000> just<00:01:39.210> toss<00:01:39.450> them

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:39.659 
the grains separate so just toss them

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:41.300 
the grains separate so just toss them
around<00:01:39.780> until<00:01:40.320> they've<00:01:40.710> all<00:01:40.860> got<00:01:41.009> a<00:01:41.040> nice

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
around until they've all got a nice

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:43.730 
around until they've all got a nice
coating<00:01:41.700> and<00:01:42.090> then<00:01:42.899> the<00:01:43.020> next<00:01:43.290> thing<00:01:43.439> you<00:01:43.560> do

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 
coating and then the next thing you do

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:46.010 
coating and then the next thing you do
is<00:01:43.770> add<00:01:44.130> the<00:01:44.189> liquid<00:01:44.880> I'm<00:01:45.060> just<00:01:45.450> using<00:01:45.689> water

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
is add the liquid I'm just using water

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:51.020 
is add the liquid I'm just using water
today<00:01:46.560> but<00:01:46.799> you<00:01:46.920> can<00:01:47.070> use<00:01:47.280> stock<00:01:49.759> so<00:01:50.759> in<00:01:50.909> it

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 
today but you can use stock so in it

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:55.910 
today but you can use stock so in it
goes<00:01:51.060> and<00:01:53.240> then<00:01:54.240> I'm<00:01:55.170> just<00:01:55.409> going<00:01:55.590> to<00:01:55.710> give<00:01:55.890> it

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 
goes and then I'm just going to give it

00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:01.580 
goes and then I'm just going to give it
a<00:01:56.130> stir<00:01:56.520> and<00:01:58.939> what<00:01:59.939> I<00:01:59.969> didn't<00:02:00.299> tell<00:02:00.450> you<00:02:00.630> is<00:02:00.960> you

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590 
a stir and what I didn't tell you is you

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:04.490 
a stir and what I didn't tell you is you
don't<00:02:01.860> ever<00:02:02.090> wash<00:02:03.090> rice<00:02:03.570> you<00:02:03.869> don't<00:02:04.079> need<00:02:04.320> to

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:04.500 
don't ever wash rice you don't need to

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:06.410 
don't ever wash rice you don't need to
it's<00:02:04.770> all<00:02:05.040> cleansed<00:02:05.670> in<00:02:05.790> the<00:02:05.909> milling<00:02:06.240> and

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:06.420 
it's all cleansed in the milling and

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:09.229 
it's all cleansed in the milling and
sometimes<00:02:07.290> some<00:02:07.500> of<00:02:07.590> the<00:02:07.680> nutrients<00:02:08.310> that<00:02:09.119> are

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:09.239 
sometimes some of the nutrients that are

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:10.880 
sometimes some of the nutrients that are
clinging<00:02:09.599> onto<00:02:09.750> the<00:02:09.989> rice<00:02:10.140> are<00:02:10.410> best<00:02:10.619> left

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:10.890 
clinging onto the rice are best left

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:12.770 
clinging onto the rice are best left
there<00:02:11.280> so<00:02:11.730> you<00:02:11.790> don't<00:02:11.970> need<00:02:12.180> to<00:02:12.270> wash<00:02:12.480> it<00:02:12.660> in

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:12.780 
there so you don't need to wash it in

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:13.300 
there so you don't need to wash it in
any

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:13.310 
any

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:15.370 
any
it'll<00:02:13.910> be<00:02:14.000> purified<00:02:14.270> because<00:02:14.810> it's<00:02:15.110> going<00:02:15.290> to

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:15.380 
it'll be purified because it's going to

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:17.559 
it'll be purified because it's going to
be<00:02:15.560> boiled<00:02:15.860> this<00:02:16.640> will<00:02:16.850> come<00:02:17.000> up<00:02:17.030> to<00:02:17.270> simmering

00:02:17.559 --> 00:02:17.569 
be boiled this will come up to simmering

00:02:17.569 --> 00:02:19.510 
be boiled this will come up to simmering
point<00:02:17.900> in<00:02:18.080> a<00:02:18.140> minute<00:02:18.260> so<00:02:18.980> you<00:02:19.069> don't<00:02:19.250> have<00:02:19.400> to

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:19.520 
point in a minute so you don't have to

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:21.730 
point in a minute so you don't have to
worry<00:02:19.700> about<00:02:19.819> that<00:02:20.150> then<00:02:21.020> as<00:02:21.290> soon<00:02:21.470> as<00:02:21.530> it

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:21.740 
worry about that then as soon as it

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:23.260 
worry about that then as soon as it
comes<00:02:21.920> up<00:02:22.069> to<00:02:22.220> simmering<00:02:22.520> point<00:02:22.760> which<00:02:23.030> that

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:23.270 
comes up to simmering point which that

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:27.460 
comes up to simmering point which that
is<00:02:23.480> now<00:02:23.810> you<00:02:24.500> put<00:02:24.740> a<00:02:24.770> lid<00:02:25.100> on<00:02:25.130> and<00:02:26.110> you<00:02:27.110> give<00:02:27.319> it

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:27.470 
is now you put a lid on and you give it

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:31.570 
is now you put a lid on and you give it
between<00:02:27.920> 12<00:02:28.880> and<00:02:29.090> 15<00:02:29.330> minutes<00:02:30.080> to<00:02:30.290> cook<00:02:30.580> now

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:31.580 
between 12 and 15 minutes to cook now

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:33.160 
between 12 and 15 minutes to cook now
I'm<00:02:31.670> going<00:02:31.850> to<00:02:31.910> give<00:02:32.030> you<00:02:32.090> the<00:02:32.209> most<00:02:32.330> important

I'm going to give you the most important
rule<00:02:33.380> of<00:02:33.410> all<00:02:33.709> and<00:02:33.950> where<00:02:34.580> most<00:02:35.000> people<00:02:35.180> go

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:35.660 
rule of all and where most people go

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:38.440 
rule of all and where most people go
wrong<00:02:35.900> and<00:02:36.770> that<00:02:36.950> is<00:02:37.250> you<00:02:37.550> must<00:02:37.880> leave<00:02:38.270> it

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:38.450 
wrong and that is you must leave it

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:42.370 
wrong and that is you must leave it
alone<00:02:39.790> what<00:02:40.790> happens<00:02:41.239> is<00:02:41.450> you<00:02:41.690> know<00:02:41.720> you're

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:42.380 
alone what happens is you know you're

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:43.809 
alone what happens is you know you're
cooking<00:02:42.709> rice<00:02:42.890> you<00:02:43.220> might<00:02:43.370> be<00:02:43.489> doing<00:02:43.580> it<00:02:43.730> for

00:02:43.809 --> 00:02:43.819 
cooking rice you might be doing it for

00:02:43.819 --> 00:02:44.890 
cooking rice you might be doing it for
the<00:02:43.880> first<00:02:44.030> time<00:02:44.300> you<00:02:44.450> might<00:02:44.600> be<00:02:44.720> a<00:02:44.750> bit

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:44.900 
the first time you might be a bit

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:45.490 
the first time you might be a bit
nervous

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:45.500 
nervous

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:47.440 
nervous
so<00:02:45.860> you<00:02:45.920> take<00:02:46.220> the<00:02:46.370> lid<00:02:46.550> off<00:02:46.580> and<00:02:47.030> then<00:02:47.120> you<00:02:47.239> go

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:47.450 
so you take the lid off and then you go

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:50.530 
so you take the lid off and then you go
in<00:02:47.600> with<00:02:47.720> your<00:02:47.870> spoon<00:02:48.230> and<00:02:48.470> have<00:02:48.590> a<00:02:48.620> stir<00:02:49.540> and

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:50.540 
in with your spoon and have a stir and

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:53.140 
in with your spoon and have a stir and
what<00:02:50.750> that<00:02:50.930> does<00:02:51.170> is<00:02:51.530> it<00:02:52.190> disturbs<00:02:52.640> the<00:02:52.880> grains

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:53.150 
what that does is it disturbs the grains

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:56.380 
what that does is it disturbs the grains
the<00:02:53.989> stirring<00:02:54.650> breaks<00:02:55.070> them<00:02:55.459> and<00:02:55.700> all<00:02:56.269> the

00:02:56.380 --> 00:02:56.390 
the stirring breaks them and all the

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:58.540 
the stirring breaks them and all the
starch<00:02:56.750> that's<00:02:57.200> inside<00:02:57.590> the<00:02:57.800> grains<00:02:58.069> comes

00:02:58.540 --> 00:02:58.550 
starch that's inside the grains comes

00:02:58.550 --> 00:03:01.030 
starch that's inside the grains comes
out<00:02:58.850> and<00:02:59.150> the<00:02:59.510> rice<00:02:59.720> becomes<00:03:00.260> sticky<00:03:00.709> and

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:01.040 
out and the rice becomes sticky and

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:03.699 
out and the rice becomes sticky and
that's<00:03:01.610> why<00:03:01.970> you've<00:03:02.630> probably<00:03:02.870> had<00:03:03.260> failures

00:03:03.699 --> 00:03:03.709 
that's why you've probably had failures

00:03:03.709 --> 00:03:06.100 
that's why you've probably had failures
in<00:03:03.830> the<00:03:03.920> past<00:03:03.950> if<00:03:04.459> you<00:03:04.550> have<00:03:04.730> had<00:03:04.940> failures<00:03:05.420> so

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:06.110 
in the past if you have had failures so

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:08.470 
in the past if you have had failures so
the<00:03:06.680> most<00:03:06.980> important<00:03:07.489> rule<00:03:07.700> is<00:03:07.910> please<00:03:08.450> please

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:08.480 
the most important rule is please please

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:09.970 
the most important rule is please please
leave<00:03:09.290> it<00:03:09.440> alone

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:09.980 
leave it alone

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:12.430 
leave it alone

in<00:03:12.590> 12<00:03:12.860> minutes<00:03:13.130> just<00:03:13.459> take<00:03:13.640> a<00:03:13.670> little<00:03:14.030> grain

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:14.480 
in 12 minutes just take a little grain

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:17.110 
in 12 minutes just take a little grain
between<00:03:15.050> your<00:03:15.260> fingers<00:03:15.980> and<00:03:16.190> see<00:03:16.580> if<00:03:16.850> it's

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:17.120 
between your fingers and see if it's

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:19.250 
between your fingers and see if it's
cooked

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:19.260

cooked
and<00:03:20.690> when<00:03:21.690> the<00:03:21.840> rice<00:03:22.050> is<00:03:22.319> cooked<00:03:22.800> as<00:03:23.159> I<00:03:23.790> said

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:23.970 
and when the rice is cooked as I said

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:26.180 
and when the rice is cooked as I said
before<00:03:24.120> you<00:03:24.540> can<00:03:24.720> just<00:03:24.930> take<00:03:25.140> a<00:03:25.170> little<00:03:25.409> grain

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:26.190 
before you can just take a little grain

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:28.130 
before you can just take a little grain
to<00:03:26.519> see<00:03:26.640> if<00:03:26.730> it's<00:03:26.879> ready<00:03:27.060> another<00:03:27.569> way<00:03:27.780> to<00:03:27.840> tell

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:28.140 
to see if it's ready another way to tell

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:31.009

there's no liquid left you know that
it's<00:03:35.790> all<00:03:35.970> been<00:03:36.180> absorbed<00:03:36.720> and<00:03:36.840> the<00:03:37.049> rice<00:03:37.230> is

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:37.440 
it's all been absorbed and the rice is

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:39.440 
it's all been absorbed and the rice is
ready<00:03:37.620> the<00:03:38.280> next<00:03:38.549> thing<00:03:38.700> you<00:03:38.790> need<00:03:38.910> to<00:03:39.030> do<00:03:39.209> is

switch the heat off and then what you do
is<00:03:42.900> you<00:03:43.170> put<00:03:43.379> a<00:03:43.590> tea<00:03:44.280> cloth<00:03:44.549> on<00:03:44.819> the<00:03:45.060> rice<00:03:45.269> like

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:45.840 
is you put a tea cloth on the rice like

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:48.800 
is you put a tea cloth on the rice like
that<00:03:46.079> and<00:03:46.410> just<00:03:47.220> leave<00:03:47.459> it<00:03:47.730> for<00:03:47.910> five<00:03:48.390> or<00:03:48.420> ten

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:48.810 
that and just leave it for five or ten

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:50.869 
that and just leave it for five or ten
minutes<00:03:49.170> to<00:03:49.349> settle<00:03:49.650> and<00:03:50.220> what<00:03:50.370> happens<00:03:50.730> is

00:03:50.869 --> 00:03:50.879 
minutes to settle and what happens is

00:03:50.879 --> 00:03:53.180 
minutes to settle and what happens is
the<00:03:51.030> steam<00:03:51.360> will<00:03:51.900> be<00:03:52.049> absorbed<00:03:52.560> in<00:03:52.709> the<00:03:52.769> cloth
