00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.120
 Hi everyone, I managed to put in 

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:09.120
 function my fantastic newest 

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:11.880
 wonderful wonderful put that said 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:13.559
 however leave trying to do this 

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:17.850
 video what surely will feel a 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:19.830
 little bit and I don't know it anyway 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:23.400
 trying now to make you a very video 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:27.390
 simple to try it supplied to reason 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:28.980
 you want to do and time like video for 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:31.470
 the my kitchen lab series even if in 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:34.290
 In reality it is really a nonsense 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:39.270
 however video that this nonsense from in 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:41.969
 reality appears a turning point and precise 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:44.430
 now around let's try it I try it 

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:47.340
 with this body because tomorrow I would like 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:49.200
 take it around with me and so I want to 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:50.870
 a little bit to understand well since the 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:54.059
 first time using it 

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:56.760
 then what am I talking about today? 

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:59.879
 homemade bluish then I am from 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:02.760
 when I'm bb but trying to do i 

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:04.589
 Homemade popsicles with the juices of 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:07.110
 fruit and since they are big but that 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:08.340
 punctually then when I go to 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:11.100
 to resume I really remain 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:15.479
 very bad now instead a moment below 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:18.930
 the water is removed from the film archive voice 

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:21.330
 stretch our exhibition journey to the conad 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:24.000
 learned these little things for very little 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:26.430
 make popsicles precisely and I don't know if 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.530
 you have never tried but put in 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:29.820
 ice with fruit juices 

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:33.090
 the part punctually traditional 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:35.220
 practice is down and tasty ago 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:37.380
 result of fruit juice while 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:39.780
 the other part above knows practically of 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:41.220
 ice water because the juices that 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:42.960
 around the supermarkets are nissim 

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:47.070
 they are usually composed mainly 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:48.799
 from water sugars and I said other to 

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:52.530
 a turning point 

00:01:48.799 --> 00:01:55.259
 with these on who here one hundred percent 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:56.560
 fruit the one for which a band lived 

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:58.630
 I had taken to nature 

00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:01.270
 however for example this here or a 

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:04.750
 juice one hundred percent apple the match 

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:07.479
 very good and using these juices 

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:09.330
 then one hundred percent fruit to make i 

00:02:07.479 --> 00:02:12.670
 icicles the icicles as you see 

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:14.380
 they all know the same taste 

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:17.410
 so there is no separation between water and 

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:27.550
 juice because all juice all fruit and 

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:29.459
 so it's a wonderful cool thing 

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:33.280
 so nothing I know is trivial 

00:02:29.459 --> 00:02:35.080
 surely though without then i 

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:37.060
 those icicles to buy we know 

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:38.830
 very well they are full full of 

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:41.739
 sugar dyes that obviously 

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:44.590
 they hurt this is a great solution 

00:02:41.739 --> 00:02:46.299
 because in the end we also save ourselves 

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:48.970
 because here is a package here 

00:02:46.299 --> 00:02:51.610
 with you a liter of juice one hundred percent 

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:54.580
 cost fruit it cost me two had 

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:57.430
 also for another it is organic and all that is 

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:59.049
 with this here you want to do i 

00:02:57.430 --> 00:03:01.570
 Popsicles with a whole bottle of 

00:02:59.049 --> 00:03:04.450
 these and icicles are sharply 

00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:07.780
 more good are much healthier and 

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:09.910
 so fantastic so I repeat only e 

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:11.500
 maybe it may seem trivial though 

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:14.230
 it was a life I was trying to do for myself 

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:16.000
 icicles in the house and finally they are 

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:18.130
 managed to find the method to do 

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:20.799
 Homemade popsicles 

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:23.160
 in short, even a little healthier than the state a 

00:03:20.799 --> 00:03:25.470
 those around 

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:27.360
 nothing therefore alive 100 percent juices 

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:29.480
 fruit and then I wonder what that is 

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:31.740
 can make 100 percent fruit juices 

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:33.660
 because they just don't do enough for you 

00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:36.900
 one hundred fruit and 109 on junk table 

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:37.350
 inside junk dyes preservatives 

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:39.540
 bach 

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:43.710
 anyway apart from that I hope you will 

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:45.210
 see you feel good was a test let's say 

00:03:43.710 --> 00:03:47.360
 a buddha owner to say this 

00:03:45.210 --> 00:03:49.440
 which did not require a video 

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:51.930
 in particular a video recording 

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:55.530
 particular to try this 

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:57.150
 telecamerina is slow and with that it is 

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:59.930
 all of manager and a toilet bowl china 

00:03:57.150 --> 00:03:59.930
 next video hello
