edger which i just recently picked up it
has<00:01:07.590> really<00:01:07.890> improved<00:01:08.189> my<00:01:08.490> quality<00:01:08.850> a<00:01:09.360> lot<00:01:09.810> of

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960 
has really improved my quality a lot of

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:12.500 
has really improved my quality a lot of
times<00:01:10.369> logs<00:01:11.369> that<00:01:11.670> I<00:01:11.880> mean<00:01:12.090> lumber<00:01:12.390> that

times logs that I mean lumber that

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:13.880 
times logs that I mean lumber that
wouldn't<00:01:12.869> normally<00:01:13.049> needed<00:01:13.500> to<00:01:13.650> be<00:01:13.740> edged

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
wouldn't normally needed to be edged

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:16.039 
wouldn't normally needed to be edged
I'll<00:01:14.159> run<00:01:14.369> through<00:01:14.640> the<00:01:15.090> edger<00:01:15.420> just<00:01:15.720> to<00:01:15.869> make

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049 
I'll run through the edger just to make

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:18.920 
I'll run through the edger just to make
it<00:01:16.080> a<00:01:16.229> better<00:01:16.380> quality<00:01:16.710> piece<00:01:17.280> I<00:01:17.659> also<00:01:18.659> reach

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
it a better quality piece I also reach

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:20.660 
it a better quality piece I also reach
are<00:01:19.110> from<00:01:19.290> own<00:01:19.439> blades<00:01:19.770> I<00:01:19.950> wanted<00:01:20.189> to<00:01:20.280> control

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
are from own blades I wanted to control

are from own blades I wanted to control
over<00:01:20.850> to<00:01:21.090> sharpen<00:01:21.420> at<00:01:21.570> my<00:01:21.689> convenience<00:01:22.110> and<00:01:22.710> I

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:22.799 
over to sharpen at my convenience and I

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:24.530 
over to sharpen at my convenience and I
think<00:01:23.070> I'm<00:01:23.159> working<00:01:23.430> with<00:01:23.520> about<00:01:23.640> 75<00:01:24.240> blades

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
think I'm working with about 75 blades

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:26.300 
think I'm working with about 75 blades
right<00:01:24.750> now<00:01:24.960> so<00:01:25.229> I'll<00:01:25.350> take<00:01:25.500> a<00:01:25.560> rainy<00:01:25.830> day<00:01:26.070> or<00:01:26.100> a

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
sharpen blades all day that way I can

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:33.469 
sharpen blades all day that way I can
keep<00:01:32.189> myself<00:01:32.340> in<00:01:32.640> the<00:01:32.670> fresh<00:01:32.880> supply<00:01:33.119> which<00:01:33.329> as

you<00:01:33.600> can<00:01:33.659> see<00:01:33.780> I'm<00:01:34.110> depleted<00:01:35.040> right<00:01:35.189> now<00:01:35.369> so<00:01:35.549> I

00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:35.579 
you can see I'm depleted right now so I

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:40.100 
you can see I'm depleted right now so I
need<00:01:35.759> to<00:01:35.820> sharpen<00:01:36.180> soon<00:01:38.630> well<00:01:39.630> of<00:01:39.720> course<00:01:39.780> when

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
need to sharpen soon well of course when

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:41.840 
need to sharpen soon well of course when
I<00:01:40.140> when<00:01:40.409> I<00:01:40.439> need<00:01:40.650> logs<00:01:40.860> of<00:01:41.159> whatever<00:01:41.400> species

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
I when I need logs of whatever species

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:43.910 
I when I need logs of whatever species
I'll<00:01:42.240> call<00:01:42.450> up<00:01:42.630> the<00:01:42.780> logger<00:01:42.990> I<00:01:43.110> work<00:01:43.409> with<00:01:43.619> and

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920 
I'll call up the logger I work with and

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:45.859 
I'll call up the logger I work with and
he'll<00:01:44.040> roll<00:01:44.220> in<00:01:44.430> and<00:01:45.119> we'll<00:01:45.240> unload<00:01:45.570> him<00:01:45.750> and

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:45.869 
he'll roll in and we'll unload him and

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:47.060 
he'll roll in and we'll unload him and
the<00:01:45.930> first<00:01:46.140> thing<00:01:46.320> we're<00:01:46.439> going<00:01:46.530> to<00:01:46.590> do<00:01:46.799> is

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:47.070 
the first thing we're going to do is

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:48.800 
the first thing we're going to do is
encode<00:01:47.490> the<00:01:47.640> logs<00:01:47.820> with<00:01:48.090> anchor<00:01:48.390> steel<00:01:48.630> and

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:48.810 
encode the logs with anchor steel and

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:50.389 
encode the logs with anchor steel and
that<00:01:48.930> will<00:01:49.049> help<00:01:49.439> prevent<00:01:49.710> checking<00:01:50.159> on<00:01:50.280> the

00:01:50.389 --> 00:01:50.399 
that will help prevent checking on the

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:52.940 
that will help prevent checking on the
ends<00:01:50.729> and<00:01:50.909> I<00:01:51.360> do<00:01:51.420> use<00:01:51.840> a<00:01:51.869> color<00:01:52.530> coding<00:01:52.920> system

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950 
ends and I do use a color coding system

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:55.039 
ends and I do use a color coding system
in<00:01:53.460> some<00:01:53.670> cases<00:01:53.939> to<00:01:54.210> help<00:01:54.299> me<00:01:54.479> differentiate

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:55.049 
in some cases to help me differentiate

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:57.080 
in some cases to help me differentiate
the<00:01:55.350> species<00:01:55.829> if<00:01:56.040> they're<00:01:56.189> customer<00:01:56.610> logs<00:01:56.820> or

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:57.090 
the species if they're customer logs or

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:58.429 
the species if they're customer logs or
my<00:01:57.180> logs<00:01:57.390> or<00:01:57.659> whatever

00:01:58.429 --> 00:01:58.439 
my logs or whatever

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:00.709 
my logs or whatever
and<00:01:59.249> then<00:01:59.729> hopefully<00:01:59.909> I'll<00:02:00.210> get<00:02:00.390> right<00:02:00.509> on

00:02:00.709 --> 00:02:00.719 
and then hopefully I'll get right on

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:03.499 
and then hopefully I'll get right on
those<00:02:00.990> logs<00:02:01.319> within<00:02:01.829> the<00:02:01.920> next<00:02:02.179> week<00:02:03.179> or<00:02:03.329> two

00:02:03.499 --> 00:02:03.509 
those logs within the next week or two

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:13.030 
those logs within the next week or two
and<00:02:03.810> get<00:02:04.020> on<00:02:04.200> them<00:02:04.380> and<00:02:04.469> cut<00:02:04.770> them<00:02:04.829> up

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:13.040 

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:15.320 

put<00:02:14.040> them<00:02:14.160> out<00:02:14.250> in<00:02:14.280> the<00:02:14.430> air<00:02:14.580> drying<00:02:14.850> building

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:15.330 
put them out in the air drying building

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:18.110 
put them out in the air drying building
where<00:02:15.480> they<00:02:15.600> can<00:02:15.780> air<00:02:15.930> dry<00:02:16.170> and<00:02:16.610> the<00:02:17.610> more<00:02:18.000> they

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:18.120 
where they can air dry and the more they

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:20.240 
where they can air dry and the more they
air<00:02:18.270> dry<00:02:18.540> the<00:02:18.960> less<00:02:19.440> time<00:02:19.680> they'll<00:02:19.890> spend<00:02:20.130> in

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:20.250 
air dry the less time they'll spend in

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:22.250 
air dry the less time they'll spend in
the<00:02:20.340> kiln<00:02:20.580> eventually<00:02:21.120> which<00:02:21.780> saves<00:02:22.050> me<00:02:22.140> money

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:22.260 
the kiln eventually which saves me money

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:26.300 
the kiln eventually which saves me money
on<00:02:22.530> electricity<00:02:23.160> and<00:02:23.690> then<00:02:24.690> as<00:02:25.200> the<00:02:25.770> kiln<00:02:26.040> load

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:26.310 
on electricity and then as the kiln load

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:28.940 
on electricity and then as the kiln load
winds<00:02:26.760> down<00:02:26.970> I'll<00:02:27.270> pick<00:02:27.600> up<00:02:27.780> and<00:02:27.960> call<00:02:28.170> the

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:28.950 
winds down I'll pick up and call the

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:30.710 
winds down I'll pick up and call the
customers<00:02:29.490> that<00:02:29.730> tend<00:02:30.030> to<00:02:30.090> take<00:02:30.270> the<00:02:30.420> larger

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:30.720 
customers that tend to take the larger

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:32.180 
customers that tend to take the larger
quantities<00:02:31.260> of<00:02:31.410> whatever<00:02:31.650> is<00:02:31.740> in<00:02:31.830> the<00:02:31.950> kiln

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:32.190 
quantities of whatever is in the kiln

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:34.340 
quantities of whatever is in the kiln
and<00:02:32.460> try<00:02:32.940> to<00:02:33.000> time<00:02:33.300> it<00:02:33.330> so<00:02:33.630> they<00:02:33.750> can<00:02:33.930> come<00:02:34.140> and

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:34.350 
and try to time it so they can come and

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:35.990 
and try to time it so they can come and
pick<00:02:34.830> up<00:02:35.010> right<00:02:35.070> out<00:02:35.340> of<00:02:35.430> the<00:02:35.490> kiln<00:02:35.730> and<00:02:35.850> I'll

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:36.000 
pick up right out of the kiln and I'll

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:37.430 
pick up right out of the kiln and I'll
give<00:02:36.180> them<00:02:36.270> a<00:02:36.390> ten<00:02:36.570> percent<00:02:36.810> discount<00:02:36.900> because

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:37.440 
give them a ten percent discount because

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:39.530 
give them a ten percent discount because
I<00:02:37.560> don't<00:02:37.740> handle<00:02:38.100> it<00:02:38.250> again<00:02:38.520> and<00:02:38.910> then

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:39.540 
I don't handle it again and then

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:40.850 
I don't handle it again and then
whatever<00:02:39.810> doesn't<00:02:40.080> sell<00:02:40.380> out<00:02:40.410> of<00:02:40.560> the<00:02:40.650> kiln

whatever doesn't sell out of the kiln

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:43.040 
whatever doesn't sell out of the kiln
will<00:02:40.980> be<00:02:41.100> stacked<00:02:41.370> over<00:02:41.670> in<00:02:41.820> the<00:02:42.050> building

00:04:47.129 --> 00:04:47.139 
because if I hadn't bought one then I

00:04:47.139 --> 00:04:48.690 
because if I hadn't bought one then I
would<00:04:47.380> have<00:04:47.470> bought<00:04:47.620> one<00:04:47.770> by<00:04:47.980> now<00:04:48.130> anyway

00:04:48.690 --> 00:04:48.700 
would have bought one by now anyway
