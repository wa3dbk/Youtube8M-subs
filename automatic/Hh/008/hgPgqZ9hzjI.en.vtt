that beauty of the under painting up at
the<00:00:08.940> usual<00:00:09.330> kind<00:00:09.960> of<00:00:10.080> painting<00:00:10.469> on<00:00:10.590> top

00:00:10.879 --> 00:00:10.889 
the usual kind of painting on top

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:14.919 
the usual kind of painting on top
leave<00:00:11.580> the<00:00:12.389> under<00:00:12.719> painting<00:00:12.990> showing<00:00:13.559> through

00:00:14.919 --> 00:00:14.929 
leave the under painting showing through

00:00:14.929 --> 00:00:24.609 
leave the under painting showing through
okay<00:00:15.929> let's<00:00:16.830> see<00:00:17.190> go<00:00:18.150> some<00:00:18.570> more

00:00:24.609 --> 00:00:24.619 

00:00:24.619 --> 00:00:28.009 

good<00:00:25.619> and<00:00:25.949> then<00:00:26.460> you<00:00:26.580> can<00:00:26.760> actually<00:00:27.000> even<00:00:27.840> put

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:28.019 
good and then you can actually even put

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:31.099 
good and then you can actually even put
some<00:00:28.730> positive<00:00:29.730> branches<00:00:30.269> on<00:00:30.510> there<00:00:30.929> as<00:00:31.080> well

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:31.109 
some positive branches on there as well

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:34.220 
some positive branches on there as well
within<00:00:32.009> there<00:00:32.520> we<00:00:33.120> I<00:00:33.149> know<00:00:33.239> we<00:00:33.540> did<00:00:33.719> positive

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:34.230 
within there we I know we did positive

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:36.410 
within there we I know we did positive
branches<00:00:34.860> on<00:00:35.010> the<00:00:35.070> outside<00:00:35.700> without<00:00:36.000> here

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:36.420 
branches on the outside without here

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:40.610 
branches on the outside without here
like<00:00:36.719> that<00:00:36.989> so<00:00:37.860> on<00:00:38.100> but<00:00:38.610> you<00:00:38.760> can<00:00:38.940> do<00:00:39.540> it<00:00:39.719> on<00:00:39.930> the

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
like that so on but you can do it on the

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:42.920 
like that so on but you can do it on the
inside<00:00:41.160> as<00:00:41.399> well<00:00:41.610> like<00:00:41.910> for<00:00:42.090> instance<00:00:42.149> this

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930 
inside as well like for instance this

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:46.700 
inside as well like for instance this
tells<00:00:43.290> me<00:00:43.469> that<00:00:44.129> it<00:00:44.340> could<00:00:44.579> be<00:00:44.820> a<00:00:45.030> branch<00:00:45.710> doing

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
tells me that it could be a branch doing

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:54.319 
tells me that it could be a branch doing
something<00:00:47.250> like<00:00:47.280> that<00:00:48.020> okay<00:00:49.020> and<00:00:49.579> so<00:00:51.260> that<00:00:53.329> now

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:54.329 
something like that okay and so that now

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:56.389 
something like that okay and so that now

friends is here I need to have a little

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:59.119 
friends is here I need to have a little
bit<00:00:56.550> more<00:00:56.760> of<00:00:56.969> a<00:00:57.120> push<00:00:57.899> I<00:00:58.140> call<00:00:58.350> it<00:00:58.469> a<00:00:58.559> pushback

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
bit more of a push I call it a pushback

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:01.970 
bit more of a push I call it a pushback
so<00:00:59.760> what<00:00:59.969> I'm<00:01:00.120> doing<00:01:00.390> I'm<00:01:01.170> putting<00:01:01.710> a<00:01:01.800> little

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
so what I'm doing I'm putting a little

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:05.890 
so what I'm doing I'm putting a little
bit<00:01:02.160> of<00:01:02.250> sky<00:01:02.789> like<00:01:03.239> color<00:01:03.809> right<00:01:04.799> in<00:01:05.040> there

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:05.900 
bit of sky like color right in there

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:09.770 
bit of sky like color right in there
picking<00:01:06.900> up<00:01:07.049> that<00:01:07.380> color<00:01:07.830> and<00:01:08.250> so<00:01:09.240> it<00:01:09.420> gives

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
picking up that color and so it gives

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:12.460 
picking up that color and so it gives
the<00:01:10.020> feeling<00:01:10.320> of<00:01:10.680> it<00:01:10.860> that<00:01:11.460> is<00:01:11.640> pushing<00:01:12.030> back

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:12.470 
the feeling of it that is pushing back

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:17.149 
the feeling of it that is pushing back
and<00:01:13.610> we<00:01:14.610> and<00:01:14.820> creating<00:01:15.630> them<00:01:15.930> that<00:01:16.500> foreground

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159 
and we and creating them that foreground

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:19.820 
and we and creating them that foreground
three<00:01:17.520> then<00:01:18.000> you<00:01:18.240> could<00:01:18.420> very<00:01:18.720> easily<00:01:18.830> with

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830 
three then you could very easily with

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:23.390 
three then you could very easily with
some<00:01:20.040> very<00:01:20.340> darks<00:01:20.850> as<00:01:21.840> we<00:01:22.080> did<00:01:22.290> earlier<00:01:22.770> with

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400 
some very darks as we did earlier with

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:26.499 
some very darks as we did earlier with
some<00:01:23.640> very<00:01:23.970> darks<00:01:24.420> come<00:01:25.229> in<00:01:25.380> and<00:01:25.680> do<00:01:25.979> some

00:01:26.499 --> 00:01:26.509 
some very darks come in and do some

00:01:26.509 --> 00:01:29.810 
some very darks come in and do some
outlining<00:01:27.509> and<00:01:27.990> texturing<00:01:28.650> and<00:01:29.310> all<00:01:29.490> that

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
outlining and texturing and all that

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:32.179 
outlining and texturing and all that
kind<00:01:30.150> of<00:01:30.240> stuff<00:01:30.390> that's<00:01:30.750> that<00:01:31.470> that<00:01:31.860> you<00:01:32.009> can

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:32.189 
kind of stuff that's that that you can

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:36.260 
kind of stuff that's that that you can
do<00:01:32.310> with<00:01:32.490> the<00:01:32.610> dry<00:01:32.909> brush<00:01:33.240> and<00:01:35.000> watch<00:01:36.000> out<00:01:36.240> oh

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270 
do with the dry brush and watch out oh

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:39.620 
do with the dry brush and watch out oh
don't<00:01:36.750> overdo<00:01:37.560> that<00:01:37.829> only<00:01:38.579> do<00:01:39.060> it<00:01:39.210> kind<00:01:39.509> of

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630 
don't overdo that only do it kind of

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:42.980 
don't overdo that only do it kind of
basically<00:01:40.170> at<00:01:40.650> your<00:01:41.250> major<00:01:42.030> tree<00:01:42.570> which<00:01:42.840> I

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990 
basically at your major tree which I

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:46.039 
basically at your major tree which I
think<00:01:43.259> this<00:01:43.470> is<00:01:43.649> the<00:01:43.799> major<00:01:44.040> tree<00:01:44.549> I<00:01:45.049> think

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:46.049 
think this is the major tree I think

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:51.499 
think this is the major tree I think
that<00:01:46.470> at<00:01:46.619> this<00:01:46.770> moment<00:01:47.270> and<00:01:49.850> if<00:01:50.850> that<00:01:51.090> is<00:01:51.270> too

00:01:51.499 --> 00:01:51.509 
that at this moment and if that is too

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:54.230 
that at this moment and if that is too
light<00:01:51.750> in<00:01:52.259> comparison<00:01:52.409> to<00:01:52.890> that<00:01:53.009> tone<00:01:53.880> it<00:01:54.090> down

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:54.240 
light in comparison to that tone it down

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:57.980 
light in comparison to that tone it down
a<00:01:54.299> bit<00:01:54.450> doesn't<00:01:55.409> take<00:01:55.740> much<00:01:56.070> to<00:01:56.399> just<00:01:56.790> kind<00:01:57.780> of

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:57.990 
a bit doesn't take much to just kind of

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:01.310 
a bit doesn't take much to just kind of
take<00:01:58.920> a<00:01:58.950> little<00:01:59.310> thing<00:01:59.909> it's<00:02:00.600> so<00:02:00.780> easy<00:02:01.079> to

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:01.320 
take a little thing it's so easy to

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:05.450 
take a little thing it's so easy to
destroy<00:02:02.159> a<00:02:02.490> light<00:02:02.850> and<00:02:03.329> it's<00:02:03.719> so<00:02:03.960> hard<00:02:04.350> to<00:02:04.680> get

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:05.460 
destroy a light and it's so hard to get

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:09.249 
destroy a light and it's so hard to get
a<00:02:05.490> light<00:02:06.560> reestablished<00:02:07.560> in<00:02:07.770> watercolor

00:02:09.249 --> 00:02:09.259 
a light reestablished in watercolor

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:12.130 
a light reestablished in watercolor
but<00:02:09.979> anyway<00:02:10.940> this<00:02:11.150> gives<00:02:11.450> you<00:02:11.599> an<00:02:11.690> idea<00:02:11.840> of

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:12.140 
but anyway this gives you an idea of

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:16.479 
but anyway this gives you an idea of
negative<00:02:12.560> painting<00:02:13.250> and<00:02:14.890> the<00:02:15.890> fun<00:02:16.129> you<00:02:16.280> can

00:02:16.479 --> 00:02:16.489 
negative painting and the fun you can

00:02:16.489 --> 00:02:19.420 
negative painting and the fun you can
have<00:02:16.519> just<00:02:17.299> doing<00:02:17.870> that<00:02:18.140> but<00:02:18.860> I<00:02:18.920> really

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:19.430 
have just doing that but I really

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:21.820 
have just doing that but I really
recommend<00:02:19.700> that<00:02:20.420> you<00:02:21.080> do<00:02:21.230> some<00:02:21.530> of<00:02:21.560> those

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:21.830 
recommend that you do some of those

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:25.539 
recommend that you do some of those
pattern<00:02:22.370> sketches<00:02:23.260> as<00:02:24.260> well<00:02:24.709> let's<00:02:24.980> look<00:02:25.340> at

00:02:25.539 --> 00:02:25.549 
pattern sketches as well let's look at

00:02:25.549 --> 00:02:26.110 
pattern sketches as well let's look at
this

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:26.120 
this

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:31.000 
this
in<00:02:26.780> a<00:02:27.440> matte<00:02:28.030> and<00:02:29.030> you<00:02:29.090> see<00:02:29.360> you<00:02:30.170> can<00:02:30.290> have<00:02:30.470> fun

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:31.010 
in a matte and you see you can have fun

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:33.580 
in a matte and you see you can have fun
it<00:02:31.160> it<00:02:31.610> it<00:02:31.879> holds<00:02:32.180> together<00:02:32.450> well<00:02:32.750> there's<00:02:33.440> a

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:33.590 
it it it holds together well there's a

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:38.649 
it it it holds together well there's a
lot<00:02:34.099> of<00:02:34.250> liveliness<00:02:35.000> we<00:02:35.540> are<00:02:37.060> we<00:02:38.060> are<00:02:38.090> unified

00:02:38.649 --> 00:02:38.659 
lot of liveliness we are we are unified

00:02:38.659 --> 00:02:42.850 
lot of liveliness we are we are unified
in<00:02:39.140> color<00:02:39.440> and<00:02:39.970> I<00:02:40.970> think<00:02:41.660> what<00:02:42.290> we've<00:02:42.500> done<00:02:42.799> now

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:42.860 
in color and I think what we've done now

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:45.729 
in color and I think what we've done now
weave<00:02:43.370> weave<00:02:43.760> from<00:02:44.360> in<00:02:44.660> Chapter<00:02:45.140> one<00:02:45.410> we've

00:02:45.729 --> 00:02:45.739 
weave weave from in Chapter one we've

00:02:45.739 --> 00:02:49.839 
weave weave from in Chapter one we've
learned<00:02:46.400> how<00:02:46.610> to<00:02:46.640> do<00:02:46.970> a<00:02:47.590> pattern<00:02:48.590> sketch<00:02:49.129> in

00:02:49.839 --> 00:02:49.849 
learned how to do a pattern sketch in

00:02:49.849 --> 00:02:53.080 
learned how to do a pattern sketch in
Chapter<00:02:50.569> two<00:02:50.900> we've<00:02:51.620> learned<00:02:51.920> how<00:02:52.250> to<00:02:52.280> do<00:02:52.730> the

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:53.090 
Chapter two we've learned how to do the

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:56.020 
Chapter two we've learned how to do the
under<00:02:53.540> painting<00:02:53.840> in<00:02:54.379> Chapter<00:02:55.310> three<00:02:55.609> to<00:02:55.849> put

00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:56.030 
under painting in Chapter three to put

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:58.900 
under painting in Chapter three to put
them<00:02:56.180> all<00:02:56.299> together<00:02:56.540> and<00:02:57.049> then<00:02:57.920> in<00:02:58.400> this<00:02:58.849> one

00:02:58.900 --> 00:02:58.910 
them all together and then in this one

00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:01.569 
them all together and then in this one
we<00:02:59.510> listen<00:03:00.260> to<00:03:00.290> the<00:03:00.530> paper<00:03:00.799> a<00:03:00.980> little<00:03:01.129> bit<00:03:01.280> more

00:03:01.569 --> 00:03:01.579 
we listen to the paper a little bit more

00:03:01.579 --> 00:03:05.349 
we listen to the paper a little bit more
and<00:03:01.879> learn<00:03:02.269> how<00:03:02.510> to<00:03:02.540> paint<00:03:02.930> negatively<00:03:04.239> next<00:03:05.239> I

00:03:05.349 --> 00:03:05.359 
and learn how to paint negatively next I

00:03:05.359 --> 00:03:06.849 
and learn how to paint negatively next I
think<00:03:05.629> we're<00:03:05.810> going<00:03:05.959> to<00:03:06.049> have<00:03:06.200> some<00:03:06.440> final

00:03:06.849 --> 00:03:06.859 
think we're going to have some final

00:03:06.859 --> 00:03:09.339 
think we're going to have some final
thoughts<00:03:07.099> and<00:03:07.640> that<00:03:07.970> will<00:03:08.209> end<00:03:08.480> this

00:03:09.339 --> 00:03:09.349 
thoughts and that will end this

00:03:09.349 --> 00:03:11.949 
thoughts and that will end this
presentation<00:03:09.769> which<00:03:10.670> has<00:03:10.910> certainly<00:03:11.390> been<00:03:11.660> a

00:03:11.949 --> 00:03:11.959 
presentation which has certainly been a

00:03:11.959 --> 00:03:16.450 
presentation which has certainly been a
lot<00:03:12.470> of<00:03:12.500> fun<00:03:12.799> for<00:03:13.010> me<00:03:13.069> and<00:03:13.400> stick<00:03:14.299> around
