00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:14.110 
it's very important that you don't pull

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:16.950 
it's very important that you don't pull
this<00:03:14.470> yarn<00:03:14.530> up<00:03:15.070> tight<00:03:15.370> and<00:03:15.700> one<00:03:16.300> way<00:03:16.450> I<00:03:16.480> keep

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:16.960 
this yarn up tight and one way I keep

00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:18.900 
this yarn up tight and one way I keep
myself<00:03:17.350> from<00:03:17.770> doing<00:03:18.100> that<00:03:18.250> is<00:03:18.430> I<00:03:18.550> keep<00:03:18.760> my

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:18.910 
myself from doing that is I keep my

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:20.640 
myself from doing that is I keep my
finger<00:03:19.270> right<00:03:19.480> between<00:03:19.660> the<00:03:19.930> two<00:03:19.960> needles<00:03:20.230> and

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:20.650 
finger right between the two needles and

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:23.730 
finger right between the two needles and
that<00:03:21.400> way<00:03:21.580> it's<00:03:22.090> basically<00:03:22.720> impossible<00:03:22.900> for

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:23.740 
that way it's basically impossible for

00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:25.980 
that way it's basically impossible for
me<00:03:23.830> to<00:03:23.860> tool<00:03:24.190> to<00:03:24.970> pull<00:03:25.210> the<00:03:25.330> yarn<00:03:25.360> up<00:03:25.720> tightly

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:25.990

hook<00:03:29.170> and<00:03:29.550> tidy<00:03:30.550> up<00:03:30.850> that<00:03:31.300> join<00:03:32.200> that's<00:03:32.830> much

00:03:33.210 --> 00:03:33.220 
hook and tidy up that join that's much

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:35.460

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:25.390 
it's okay you just act as though there

00:04:25.390 --> 00:04:26.400 
it's okay you just act as though there
was<00:04:25.690> a<00:04:25.990> sec

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:26.410 
was a sec

00:04:26.410 --> 00:04:30.150 
was a sec
and<00:04:26.500> stitching<00:04:27.010> you<00:04:27.130> go<00:04:27.730> knit<00:04:28.420> off<00:04:28.920> no<00:04:29.920> problem

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:30.160 
and stitching you go knit off no problem

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:32.610 
and stitching you go knit off no problem
and<00:04:30.730> then<00:04:31.300> you<00:04:31.420> go<00:04:31.600> to<00:04:31.660> the<00:04:31.840> back<00:04:32.050> and<00:04:32.320> you<00:04:32.440> do

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:32.620 
and then you go to the back and you do

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:35.420 
and then you go to the back and you do
purl<00:04:32.950> off<00:04:33.390> no<00:04:34.390> problem

00:04:35.420 --> 00:04:35.430 
purl off no problem

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:38.580 
purl off no problem
needles<00:04:36.430> are<00:04:36.550> completely<00:04:37.030> gone<00:04:37.570> purl<00:04:38.350> your

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:38.590 
needles are completely gone purl your

00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:41.340 
needles are completely gone purl your
yarn<00:04:38.860> through<00:04:39.250> okay<00:04:40.150> now<00:04:40.360> you<00:04:40.930> have<00:04:40.960> a<00:04:41.080> choice

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:41.350 
yarn through okay now you have a choice

00:04:41.350 --> 00:04:44.370 
yarn through okay now you have a choice
I<00:04:41.710> oftentimes<00:04:42.610> don't<00:04:43.270> use<00:04:43.720> a<00:04:43.750> crochet<00:04:44.110> hook

00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:44.380 
I oftentimes don't use a crochet hook

00:04:44.380 --> 00:04:46.020 
I oftentimes don't use a crochet hook
for<00:04:44.770> this<00:04:44.890> next<00:04:45.130> part<00:04:45.220> simply<00:04:45.760> because<00:04:45.910> I

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:46.030 
for this next part simply because I

00:04:46.030 --> 00:04:47.550 
for this next part simply because I
never<00:04:46.270> seem<00:04:46.480> to<00:04:46.510> have<00:04:46.750> one<00:04:47.020> with<00:04:47.290> me

00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:47.560 
never seem to have one with me

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:50.430 
never seem to have one with me
when<00:04:47.890> I'm<00:04:47.980> closing<00:04:48.580> the<00:04:48.790> toes<00:04:49.090> of<00:04:49.570> a<00:04:50.050> sock<00:04:50.260> or

when I'm closing the toes of a sock or

00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:52.560 
when I'm closing the toes of a sock or
anything<00:04:50.620> so<00:04:50.950> does<00:04:51.580> it<00:04:51.670> really<00:04:51.850> matter<00:04:52.060> this

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:52.570 
anything so does it really matter this

00:04:52.570 --> 00:04:55.140 
anything so does it really matter this
is<00:04:52.750> very<00:04:52.960> very<00:04:53.230> loose<00:04:53.410> what<00:04:54.250> you<00:04:54.370> do<00:04:54.610> is

00:04:55.140 --> 00:04:55.150 
is very very loose what you do is

00:04:55.150 --> 00:04:57.720 
is very very loose what you do is
whether<00:04:55.330> it's<00:04:55.570> a<00:04:55.660> sock<00:04:55.930> or<00:04:56.260> whether<00:04:56.470> it's<00:04:56.800> the

whether it's a sock or whether it's the

whether it's a sock or whether it's the
top<00:04:58.060> of<00:04:58.210> your<00:04:58.360> mitten<00:04:58.860> you<00:04:59.860> put<00:05:00.610> your<00:05:00.760> hand<00:05:00.940> in

00:05:01.140 --> 00:05:01.150 
top of your mitten you put your hand in

00:05:01.150 --> 00:05:02.610 
top of your mitten you put your hand in
there<00:05:01.300> and<00:05:01.360> see<00:05:01.690> look<00:05:01.900> look<00:05:01.930> look

Oh<00:05:02.650> messy<00:05:03.430> messy<00:05:03.730> and<00:05:04.000> at<00:05:04.540> the<00:05:04.660> first<00:05:05.380> part<00:05:05.950> the

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:06.250 
Oh messy messy and at the first part the

00:05:06.250 --> 00:05:08.190 
Oh messy messy and at the first part the
end<00:05:06.490> opposite<00:05:07.240> of<00:05:07.420> where<00:05:07.570> you've<00:05:07.750> got<00:05:07.990> your

00:05:08.190 --> 00:05:08.200 
end opposite of where you've got your

00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:13.500 
end opposite of where you've got your
nice<00:05:08.350> long<00:05:08.680> tail<00:05:09.070> you<00:05:11.370> find<00:05:12.370> the<00:05:12.700> very<00:05:13.120> very

00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:13.510 
nice long tail you find the very very

00:05:13.510 --> 00:05:17.640 
nice long tail you find the very very
first<00:05:14.550> kind<00:05:15.550> of<00:05:15.700> stitch<00:05:16.390> that<00:05:16.600> you<00:05:16.720> did<00:05:17.080> there

00:05:17.640 --> 00:05:17.650 
first kind of stitch that you did there

00:05:17.650 --> 00:05:19.920 
first kind of stitch that you did there
so<00:05:18.040> you<00:05:18.160> can<00:05:18.340> see<00:05:18.580> where<00:05:18.730> I'm<00:05:18.850> kind<00:05:19.150> of<00:05:19.240> pulling

00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:19.930 
so you can see where I'm kind of pulling

00:05:19.930 --> 00:05:21.990 
so you can see where I'm kind of pulling
in<00:05:20.200> there<00:05:20.380> it<00:05:20.500> is<00:05:20.590> okay<00:05:21.070> so<00:05:21.490> you<00:05:21.580> kind<00:05:21.760> of<00:05:21.820> pull

00:05:21.990 --> 00:05:22.000 
in there it is okay so you kind of pull

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:25.440 
in there it is okay so you kind of pull
that<00:05:22.200> then<00:05:23.200> you<00:05:23.410> move<00:05:23.620> on<00:05:23.890> and<00:05:24.490> you<00:05:24.820> go<00:05:25.000> to<00:05:25.060> the

00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:25.450 
that then you move on and you go to the

00:05:25.450 --> 00:05:27.600 
that then you move on and you go to the
next<00:05:25.780> one<00:05:26.140> and<00:05:26.380> sometimes<00:05:27.070> you<00:05:27.190> pull<00:05:27.370> on<00:05:27.490> the

00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:27.610 
next one and sometimes you pull on the

00:05:27.610 --> 00:05:28.260 
next one and sometimes you pull on the
wrong<00:05:27.790> one

00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:28.270 
wrong one

00:05:28.270 --> 00:05:30.660 
wrong one
and<00:05:28.900> you<00:05:29.020> just<00:05:29.230> fix<00:05:29.560> that<00:05:29.650> see<00:05:30.160> any<00:05:30.280> there<00:05:30.430> we

00:05:30.660 --> 00:05:30.670 
and you just fix that see any there we

00:05:30.670 --> 00:05:32.640 
and you just fix that see any there we
go<00:05:30.820> that's<00:05:31.030> not<00:05:31.180> that<00:05:31.420> there<00:05:31.900> we<00:05:31.990> go<00:05:32.140> now<00:05:32.620> I

00:05:32.640 --> 00:05:32.650 
go that's not that there we go now I

00:05:32.650 --> 00:05:35.280 
go that's not that there we go now I
tend<00:05:33.220> to<00:05:33.460> pull<00:05:33.850> when<00:05:34.390> I'm<00:05:34.510> doing<00:05:34.780> the<00:05:34.900> kitchens

00:05:35.280 --> 00:05:35.290 
tend to pull when I'm doing the kitchens

00:05:35.290 --> 00:05:37.710 
tend to pull when I'm doing the kitchens
that<00:05:35.590> Kitchener<00:05:36.160> stitch<00:05:36.190> a<00:05:36.700> little<00:05:37.060> tighter

00:05:37.710 --> 00:05:37.720 
that Kitchener stitch a little tighter

00:05:37.720 --> 00:05:40.140 
that Kitchener stitch a little tighter
than<00:05:38.080> maybe<00:05:38.410> the<00:05:38.620> whole<00:05:38.800> body<00:05:39.130> of<00:05:39.280> stitches

00:05:40.140 --> 00:05:40.150 
than maybe the whole body of stitches

00:05:40.150 --> 00:05:41.760 
than maybe the whole body of stitches
just<00:05:40.180> because<00:05:40.900> this<00:05:41.050> is<00:05:41.200> going<00:05:41.350> to<00:05:41.410> get<00:05:41.530> a<00:05:41.560> lot

00:05:41.760 --> 00:05:41.770 
just because this is going to get a lot

00:05:41.770 --> 00:05:44.460 
just because this is going to get a lot
of<00:05:41.890> stress<00:05:42.280> and<00:05:43.030> I<00:05:43.150> just<00:05:43.390> as<00:05:43.540> soon<00:05:43.570> it<00:05:43.930> be<00:05:44.169> tight

00:05:44.460 --> 00:05:44.470 
of stress and I just as soon it be tight

00:05:44.470 --> 00:05:47.790 
of stress and I just as soon it be tight
so<00:05:45.190> I'm<00:05:45.669> gonna<00:05:45.790> continue<00:05:46.030> on<00:05:46.630> I'm<00:05:47.200> gonna<00:05:47.410> kind

00:05:47.790 --> 00:05:47.800 
so I'm gonna continue on I'm gonna kind

00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:51.450 
so I'm gonna continue on I'm gonna kind
of<00:05:47.890> pull<00:05:48.190> OC<00:05:48.910> and<00:05:49.560> pull<00:05:50.560> that<00:05:51.010> one<00:05:51.220> really

00:05:51.450 --> 00:05:51.460 
of pull OC and pull that one really

00:05:51.460 --> 00:05:54.540 
of pull OC and pull that one really
tight<00:05:51.880> and<00:05:52.660> I<00:05:52.900> tend<00:05:53.380> to<00:05:53.470> move<00:05:53.770> this<00:05:53.919> out<00:05:54.160> of<00:05:54.340> my

00:05:54.540 --> 00:05:54.550 
tight and I tend to move this out of my

00:05:54.550 --> 00:05:59.540 
tight and I tend to move this out of my
way<00:05:54.900> so<00:05:55.900> I<00:05:55.930> can<00:05:56.080> see<00:05:56.580> where<00:05:57.900> Sam<00:05:58.900> right<00:05:59.169> there

00:05:59.540 --> 00:05:59.550 
way so I can see where Sam right there

00:05:59.550 --> 00:06:01.860 
way so I can see where Sam right there
pull<00:06:00.550> on<00:06:00.700> that<00:06:00.910> and<00:06:01.120> you<00:06:01.180> can<00:06:01.210> tell<00:06:01.600> it's<00:06:01.780> gonna

00:06:01.860 --> 00:06:01.870 
pull on that and you can tell it's gonna

00:06:01.870 --> 00:06:04.170 
pull on that and you can tell it's gonna
pull<00:06:02.230> from<00:06:02.470> there<00:06:02.710> and<00:06:03.490> it's<00:06:03.730> gonna<00:06:03.850> pull<00:06:04.060> that

00:06:04.170 --> 00:06:04.180 
pull from there and it's gonna pull that

00:06:04.180 --> 00:06:06.090 
pull from there and it's gonna pull that
and<00:06:04.240> so<00:06:04.480> this<00:06:04.720> is<00:06:04.930> the<00:06:05.050> loop<00:06:05.290> that<00:06:05.710> needs<00:06:05.919> to<00:06:06.070> be

00:06:06.090 --> 00:06:06.100 
and so this is the loop that needs to be

00:06:06.100 --> 00:06:08.850 
and so this is the loop that needs to be
pulled<00:06:06.490> tightly<00:06:07.000> so<00:06:07.930> I<00:06:07.960> send<00:06:08.350> it<00:06:08.470> to<00:06:08.500> the<00:06:08.650> back

00:06:08.850 --> 00:06:08.860 
pulled tightly so I send it to the back

00:06:08.860 --> 00:06:10.830 
pulled tightly so I send it to the back
and<00:06:09.190> it<00:06:09.310> makes<00:06:09.520> it<00:06:09.669> a<00:06:09.730> lot<00:06:09.940> easier<00:06:10.240> for<00:06:10.660> me<00:06:10.720> to

00:06:10.830 --> 00:06:10.840 
and it makes it a lot easier for me to

00:06:10.840 --> 00:06:14.159 
and it makes it a lot easier for me to
see<00:06:11.230> see<00:06:11.890> when<00:06:12.190> it<00:06:12.310> starts<00:06:12.340> shrinking<00:06:13.169> that

00:06:14.159 --> 00:06:14.169 
see see when it starts shrinking that

00:06:14.169 --> 00:06:16.560 
see see when it starts shrinking that
means<00:06:14.440> I<00:06:14.560> grab<00:06:14.860> the<00:06:15.070> right<00:06:15.250> one<00:06:15.550> let's<00:06:16.360> say<00:06:16.510> you

00:06:16.560 --> 00:06:16.570 
means I grab the right one let's say you
