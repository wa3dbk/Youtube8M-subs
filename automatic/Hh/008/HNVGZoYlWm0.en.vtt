00:00:03.740 --> 00:00:09.030
 hi we are curious viewers of me 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:12.120
 my name is black, my answers are ready 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:15.630
 go first question what is better 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:18.300
 catch shark hunting for sharks is underway 

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:20.689
 all year around the world and such 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:24.180
 fishing is becoming very popular 

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:26.880
 hunt are drifting or going small 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:29.130
 the course of boats with any method of fishing 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:30.859
 sharks and as bait use 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:33.480
 finely chopped fish 

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:36.450
 the main thing that the trail of the bait was 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:38.160
 continuous experienced hunters pruned 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:40.800
 tail fin that creates 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:43.860
 impression of helplessness fish bait 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:47.280
 off the coast of southwest africa especially 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:49.620
 large specimens line directly from the shore and for 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:51.960
 baits use ordinary meat 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:54.239
 the main factor is good bait 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:56.730
 its freshness is therefore to 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:58.980
 preservation bait include especially 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:01.109
 carefully the bait should be 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:03.690
 aromatic and fat so she could 

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:06.270
 attract shark shark hunting this 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:08.430
 pretty dangerous kind of sea fishing so 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:11.220
 like sharks is a predator reacting to 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:13.650
 fresh blood she feels wounded 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:16.320
 animal or fish as well as man on 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:18.509
 very long distance therefore 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:21.330
 hunting for these predators should be respected 

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:23.820
 extreme caution and novice in 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:26.009
 first time going to go out for a shark 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:28.500
 should go out with an experienced hunter 

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:29.040
 who already knew the art of hunting 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:32.189
 shark 

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:34.799
 the second question is why the person who 

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:37.500
 listens to your favorite music run over the body 

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:39.990
 goosebumps scientists have discovered that 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:42.119
 listening to your favorite music causes 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:44.189
 mediator dopamine release 

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:46.710
 involved in the regulation of important 

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:48.720
 goose bumps or musical 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:51.420
 shivering are well established 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:54.330
 signs of peak emotional reaction but 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:56.729
 language new combination of methods 

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:59.939
 brain imaging revealed 

00:01:56.729 --> 00:02:02.520
 that dopamine release is more active when 

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:04.530
 listening to your favorite music than when 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:06.740
 listening to some kind of neutral and 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:09.060
 dopamine release rate 

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:11.790
 corresponds to the degree of emotional 

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:13.910
 excitement and enjoyment level of music 

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:16.400
 These results are the first proof 

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:19.170
 what is abstract 

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:20.840
 reward how music can lead 

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:23.730
 to release dopamine 

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:26.760
 the third question is can a person 

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:29.220
 memorize everything at once in order to 

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:32.549
 remember everything and immediately take years 

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:35.790
 workouts or just need to have a gift 

00:02:32.549 --> 00:02:37.680
 or some talent for memorizing things like 

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:40.650
 for example, man is naturally good 

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:42.870
 draws or sings also by nature can 

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:45.299
 be good memory true there 

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:49.130
 few tricks how to fill in the important 

00:02:45.299 --> 00:02:51.660
 information for you 1 visualization 

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:55.260
 pretend all words and phrases 

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:58.130
 which you literally teach if you teach 

00:02:55.260 --> 00:03:01.320
 verb conjugation jump jump a 

00:02:58.130 --> 00:03:04.500
 if you need to learn and a foot or difficult in 

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:07.500
 mind play the scene you will see all 

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:10.380
 remembered incredibly quickly the second 

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:13.019
 listen to yourself learning some 

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:15.329
 information on speak it on the voice recorder 

00:03:13.019 --> 00:03:18.209
 when you fall asleep quietly turn on 

00:03:15.329 --> 00:03:20.340
 This entry needs precisely sleep under it 

00:03:18.209 --> 00:03:21.870
 a similar way you could observe 

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:24.209
 the film is a big change 

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:26.850
 here's the truth he learned a little bit not that 

00:03:24.209 --> 00:03:28.079
 so this is just a terrific method for 

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:30.660
 to fasten 

00:03:28.079 --> 00:03:34.680
 familiar but poorly remembered things 

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:37.069
 third warm up learn quiet lectures 

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:39.120
 or reports wrapped circles around the room 

00:03:37.069 --> 00:03:41.459
 the fact is that walking 

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:43.470
 activate the brain and your 

00:03:41.459 --> 00:03:46.410
 memorization ability significantly 

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:47.280
 is increasing and the fourth is the logic 

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:49.440
 Cicero 

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:51.870
 Cicero is an ancient Greek speaker 

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:52.710
 who was famous for being able to easily 

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:55.680
 memory of you 

00:03:52.710 --> 00:03:58.410
 produce any dates names quotes and 

00:03:55.680 --> 00:04:01.080
 even speeches when preparing to speak 

00:03:58.410 --> 00:04:03.960
 he had the right information in good 

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:06.600
 familiar to him the room then passed her 

00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:08.970
 several times around we repeat 

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:11.910
 all the same thing only in my thoughts 

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:14.880
 This method is closest to what 

00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:17.270
 makes sherlock his mind chambers then 

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:19.980
 have you post the information you need 

00:04:17.270 --> 00:04:22.500
 together which you can remember and 

00:04:19.980 --> 00:04:24.990
 describe in detail and if you 

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:26.880
 will need any information you 

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:29.520
 mentally enough to return to it 

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:32.670
 place and you all remember and train 

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:34.590
 and you will definitely succeed here 

00:04:32.670 --> 00:04:36.420
 I got such answers
