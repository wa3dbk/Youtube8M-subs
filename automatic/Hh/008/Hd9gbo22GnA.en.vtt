00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:10.360
 hello ladies and gentlemen and today we are 

00:00:08.620 --> 00:00:12.730
 let's talk about cooking 

00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:15.720
 maybe someone already tried something 

00:00:12.730 --> 00:00:18.880
 make someone knew someone I didn't know 

00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:22.390
 I'll tell you everything will start completely 

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:26.770
 we are with someone who learn cooking 

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:30.430
 she is the capital to study here 

00:00:26.770 --> 00:00:32.829
 at the cook respectively a cooking trainer 

00:00:30.430 --> 00:00:34.870
 when you learn from him you can 

00:00:32.829 --> 00:00:35.790
 buy a trailer you are big enough 

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:38.590
 quantity 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:41.399
 but one thing is given to you by default 

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:41.399
 we will start with him 

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:51.320
 first of all here is butcher butcher and two 

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:55.730
 variants of which of it can 

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:58.190
 chase away the buns so let's say spice york and 

00:00:55.730 --> 00:00:59.659
 sweaters one I have already open it I 

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:00.949
 made specifically for convenience in order 

00:00:59.659 --> 00:01:05.449
 to show you which of these 

00:01:00.949 --> 00:01:09.020
 perhaps we will start from the very beginning 

00:01:05.449 --> 00:01:11.869
 the main thing is actually our white meat 

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:13.850
 that's what she can jump alone 

00:01:11.869 --> 00:01:16.940
 the recipe as I have said is open to me 

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:18.860
 here are catalysts catalysts give 

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:22.369
 additional bonuses to what we 

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:25.030
 get i have one well actually i 

00:01:22.369 --> 00:01:28.130
 I see no reason to use now 

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:30.350
 we start craft all essence of craft 

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:33.560
 is the following you have 

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:36.350
 permissible range 

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:40.090
 let's say it is in this area can 

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:43.069
 appear your recipe that is missing 

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:45.530
 a little bit to the left namely here you are 

00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:47.990
 see the seasoning window here 

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:50.450
 pepper and salt or make more 

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:52.610
 sweet whichever 

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:55.759
 ingredient you choose you see the goal 

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:57.200
 your task is to make it all right 

00:01:55.759 --> 00:01:59.239
 this allowable area 

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:01.910
 I note that when you use pepper 

00:01:59.239 --> 00:02:04.849
 here you see what is moving away from the center 

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:07.759
 right if you use again 

00:02:04.849 --> 00:02:09.500
 pepper he will move even more to the right then 

00:02:07.759 --> 00:02:10.550
 there is if you salted something next time 

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:14.000
 will be even more 

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:15.800
 salty it goes without saying therefore the first 

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:18.830
 time I advise you just to sweep 

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:20.920
 the area is corny that is what i am now and 

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:20.920
 will do 

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:27.110
 notice dependencies on different 

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:28.490
 ingredients are all in different 

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:32.650
 areas that may be necessary 

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:35.060
 choose here for convenience and 

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:39.560
 special arrows that is up 

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:44.650
 right up left down right then 

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:49.049
 there is where the principle goes our goal 

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:51.879
 well, let it be like this 

00:02:49.049 --> 00:02:56.040
 after that we actually click on 

00:02:51.879 --> 00:02:59.200
 craft and see what we have we 

00:02:56.040 --> 00:03:01.269
 opened sweaters a 

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:04.480
 spicy jerkeys we opened congratulations 

00:03:01.269 --> 00:03:09.010
 friends we can now craft it 

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:11.769
 constantly here it is 

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:13.540
 now for convenience I will reload to 

00:03:11.769 --> 00:03:17.019
 the allowed area has disappeared and will show 

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:19.810
 how very quickly craft how 

00:03:17.019 --> 00:03:23.319
 you see areas of valid no more 

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:25.299
 catalyst do not use here unfortunately 

00:03:23.319 --> 00:03:27.129
 if you press very quickly from you 

00:03:25.299 --> 00:03:30.400
 only the window opens with 

00:03:27.129 --> 00:03:32.640
 which you can do this or that 

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:34.750
 eat it doesn't pick the ingredients itself 

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:37.780
 maybe it's some kind of flaw and 

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:39.250
 more will be well so long as you choose 

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:40.000
 a window opens let's say i want 

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:44.739
 sweaters 

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:49.569
 our task is to make it so that 

00:03:44.739 --> 00:03:51.940
 somehow intersected hop 1 intersection 

00:03:49.569 --> 00:03:54.970
 one ingredient is enough to 

00:03:51.940 --> 00:04:00.299
 now you have what you need 

00:03:54.970 --> 00:04:00.299
 namely green rock click on craft 

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:06.280
 as you see it turned out that we 

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:08.260
 like happiness or unfortunately with meat 

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:09.040
 not very lucky i found very quickly 

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:12.220
 second recipe 

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:14.560
 Now I will show you what happens when you 

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:16.769
 do not immediately find exactly what you want 

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:16.769
 I want to 

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:30.009
 let the set be so hope that I 

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:30.009
 I can't guess 

00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:38.680
 Here I did not guess in this case if you do not 

00:04:35.949 --> 00:04:39.490
 guess you spell the result all 

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:43.180
 know the game 

00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:45.550
 cold warmer hot the same thing 

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:48.880
 here that is our result is very far 

00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:51.100
 and what you need more 

00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:52.990
 more sweet and items that you 

00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:55.300
 used but it really isn't 

00:04:52.990 --> 00:04:56.949
 essence as important accordingly based 

00:04:55.300 --> 00:04:57.870
 we will do this now 

00:04:56.949 --> 00:05:00.870
 adjustment 

00:04:57.870 --> 00:05:03.220
 I will note that our previous experience 

00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:05.620
 is shown here and the arrow indicates 

00:05:03.220 --> 00:05:07.419
 what direction should we look for our 

00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:13.289
 option that is, our case is below 

00:05:07.419 --> 00:05:13.289
 on the right using more sweet look 

00:05:16.910 --> 00:05:21.780
 the last time I used twice 

00:05:19.350 --> 00:05:25.100
 garlic and we were recommended 

00:05:21.780 --> 00:05:27.600
 use the view well actually from that 

00:05:25.100 --> 00:05:32.130
 what we see sweet we have two 

00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:41.130
 option or pinch or well, that's it 

00:05:32.130 --> 00:05:45.030
 name we choose to start it as you 

00:05:41.130 --> 00:05:47.850
 see and this time we are much closer 

00:05:45.030 --> 00:05:50.660
 closer but we need more 

00:05:47.850 --> 00:05:57.000
 that is, we are offered what to choose 

00:05:50.660 --> 00:05:59.690
 try again later n-th amount 

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:03.150
 I did try to find a recipe 

00:05:59.690 --> 00:06:05.160
 Here is the essence of this supplement 

00:06:03.150 --> 00:06:07.800
 was to show how how 

00:06:05.160 --> 00:06:10.950
 wrong choices appear like 

00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:14.160
 they point you to where you need it 

00:06:10.950 --> 00:06:16.680
 move so we opened here 

00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:17.270
 this recipe accordingly this here 

00:06:16.680 --> 00:06:21.590
 region 

00:06:17.270 --> 00:06:23.670
 permissible it will disappear for the second 

00:06:21.590 --> 00:06:26.370
 unknown recipe will only 

00:06:23.670 --> 00:06:29.760
 this is following the example you discover and this 

00:06:26.370 --> 00:06:31.950
 Cooking recipe, respectively, too 

00:06:29.760 --> 00:06:35.490
 there is pumping wrong to believe that 

00:06:31.950 --> 00:06:39.360
 pumping is right here when choosing 

00:06:35.490 --> 00:06:42.180
 hobby cooking in other words cooking it 

00:06:39.360 --> 00:06:44.220
 only conditions conditions of getting talents 

00:06:42.180 --> 00:06:46.040
 let's say to get talent 

00:06:44.220 --> 00:06:48.390
 you need to cook the wings and 

00:06:46.040 --> 00:06:49.470
 actually all different written there 

00:06:48.390 --> 00:06:51.630
 great amount 

00:06:49.470 --> 00:06:54.240
 when you fulfill all these conditions you 

00:06:51.630 --> 00:06:56.520
 will give one talent talents this is 

00:06:54.240 --> 00:06:58.320
 just the same pumping and talents already 

00:06:56.520 --> 00:07:01.890
 used here in this tree 

00:06:58.320 --> 00:07:04.410
 when you buy all three 

00:07:01.890 --> 00:07:07.140
 actually open the second level 3 and 

00:07:04.410 --> 00:07:09.630
 so up to 8 this is called pumping 

00:07:07.140 --> 00:07:12.420
 cooking they are opening here of this tree 

00:07:09.630 --> 00:07:14.730
 do not confuse warm with soft the same 

00:07:12.420 --> 00:07:17.240
 regards by the way absolutely any 

00:07:14.730 --> 00:07:17.240
 professions 

00:07:17.580 --> 00:07:22.030
 so summarize 

00:07:19.210 --> 00:07:23.650
 in order to pump the cooking you need 

00:07:22.030 --> 00:07:26.530
 buy prescription from this uncle 

00:07:23.650 --> 00:07:27.220
 either beat them out of adventure or else 

00:07:26.530 --> 00:07:30.610
 from somewhere 

00:07:27.220 --> 00:07:32.020
 in order to make the subject even 

00:07:30.610 --> 00:07:33.970
 more precisely open it extra 

00:07:32.020 --> 00:07:34.840
 properties need to use spices for 

00:07:33.970 --> 00:07:36.790
 order to add 

00:07:34.840 --> 00:07:39.190
 special property to use 

00:07:36.790 --> 00:07:41.350
 catalysts and actually pumping 

00:07:39.190 --> 00:07:43.810
 myself skill tree when pumping 

00:07:41.350 --> 00:07:46.360
 opens talents which is used 

00:07:43.810 --> 00:07:48.610
 here in other words we upgrade them 

00:07:46.360 --> 00:07:51.370
 your cooking and becoming great 

00:07:48.610 --> 00:07:56.190
 Nexus village cook on this thank you
