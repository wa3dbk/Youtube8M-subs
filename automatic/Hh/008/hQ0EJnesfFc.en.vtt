00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
of fiction that had made me think about

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:25.010 
of fiction that had made me think about
how<00:01:22.979> I<00:01:23.369> was<00:01:23.580> connected<00:01:24.090> to<00:01:24.119> people<00:01:24.509> far<00:01:24.750> away

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.360 
and then I asked myself what if anything
