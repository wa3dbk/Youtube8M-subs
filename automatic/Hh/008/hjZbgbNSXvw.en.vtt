00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:36.170 
doing is making a homemade protein

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:38.650 
doing is making a homemade protein
treatment<00:00:36.739> the<00:00:37.460> last<00:00:37.699> time<00:00:37.910> I<00:00:37.940> did<00:00:38.180> a<00:00:38.210> protein

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:38.660 
treatment the last time I did a protein

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:42.479 
treatment the last time I did a protein
treatment<00:00:39.079> on<00:00:39.140> my<00:00:39.170> hair<00:00:39.559> was<00:00:39.980> I<00:00:40.579> think<00:00:41.000> around

this time what I'm going to do is make a

00:00:57.460 --> 00:00:57.470 
protein treatment using ingredients that

00:00:57.470 --> 00:01:00.189 
protein treatment using ingredients that
I<00:00:57.589> have<00:00:57.860> at<00:00:58.010> home<00:00:58.190> I<00:00:58.519> read<00:00:59.210> online<00:00:59.420> that<00:00:59.629> there

00:01:01.869 --> 00:01:01.879 
are multiple benefits of doing protein

00:01:01.879 --> 00:01:04.270 
are multiple benefits of doing protein

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:47.859 
then the rest is going to be my
conditioner<00:01:46.009> so<00:01:46.850> you<00:01:46.880> need<00:01:47.149> half<00:01:47.420> a<00:01:47.539> cup<00:01:47.569> of

00:01:49.719 --> 00:01:49.729 
boiling water half a cup of mayonnaise

00:01:49.729 --> 00:01:53.980 
boiling water half a cup of mayonnaise
or<00:01:50.649> conditioner<00:01:51.649> and<00:01:52.329> just<00:01:53.329> a<00:01:53.450> little<00:01:53.569> bowl<00:01:53.840> to

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:53.990 
or conditioner and just a little bowl to

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:57.849 
or conditioner and just a little bowl to
mix<00:01:54.170> it<00:01:54.469> an<00:01:54.999> application<00:01:55.999> brush<00:01:56.240> and<00:01:56.859> about

00:01:57.849 --> 00:01:57.859 
mix it an application brush and about

00:01:57.859 --> 00:01:59.679 
mix it an application brush and about
one<00:01:58.100> or<00:01:58.249> two<00:01:58.369> packs<00:01:58.639> of<00:01:58.850> gelatin<00:01:59.299> I<00:01:59.389> think<00:01:59.600> it

00:01:59.679 --> 00:01:59.689 
one or two packs of gelatin I think it

00:01:59.689 --> 00:02:02.919 
one or two packs of gelatin I think it
depends<00:02:00.079> on<00:02:00.319> how<00:02:00.679> thick<00:02:00.950> your<00:02:01.069> hair<00:02:01.310> is<00:02:01.780> so<00:02:02.780> the

00:02:02.919 --> 00:02:02.929 
depends on how thick your hair is so the

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:08.050 
depends on how thick your hair is so the
first<00:02:03.109> thing<00:02:03.350> I'm<00:02:03.469> going<00:02:03.499> to<00:02:03.740> do<00:02:04.149> is<00:02:06.909> pour<00:02:07.909> the

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:08.060 
first thing I'm going to do is pour the

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:10.500 
first thing I'm going to do is pour the
gelatin<00:02:08.630> mix<00:02:08.899> now<00:02:09.530> this<00:02:09.740> is<00:02:09.920> the<00:02:10.069> plain

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:10.510 
gelatin mix now this is the plain

00:02:10.510 --> 00:02:12.790 
gelatin mix now this is the plain
unflavored<00:02:11.510> gelatin<00:02:11.990> don't<00:02:12.290> get<00:02:12.560> the

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:12.800 
unflavored gelatin don't get the

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:16.630 
unflavored gelatin don't get the
strawberry<00:02:13.459> or<00:02:14.770> any<00:02:15.770> other<00:02:16.040> flavor<00:02:16.370> they<00:02:16.610> have

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:16.640 
strawberry or any other flavor they have

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:19.020 
strawberry or any other flavor they have
you<00:02:17.090> don't<00:02:17.270> want<00:02:17.390> to<00:02:17.450> put<00:02:17.600> that<00:02:17.720> in<00:02:17.900> your<00:02:18.050> hair

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:19.030 
you don't want to put that in your hair

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:22.059 
you don't want to put that in your hair
so<00:02:20.030> we're<00:02:20.959> going<00:02:21.050> to<00:02:21.140> pour<00:02:21.440> in<00:02:21.620> the<00:02:21.830> boiling

00:02:22.059 --> 00:02:22.069 
so we're going to pour in the boiling

00:02:22.069 --> 00:02:27.260 
so we're going to pour in the boiling
water<00:02:23.290> to<00:02:24.290> dissolve<00:02:24.500> the<00:02:25.160> gelatin<00:02:25.190> and

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:27.270 
water to dissolve the gelatin and

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:29.360 
water to dissolve the gelatin and
my<00:02:27.660> hair<00:02:28.050> is<00:02:28.200> kind<00:02:28.440> of<00:02:28.590> thick<00:02:28.860> I'm<00:02:29.070> going<00:02:29.280> to

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:29.370 
my hair is kind of thick I'm going to

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:35.540 
my hair is kind of thick I'm going to
put<00:02:29.640> two<00:02:30.120> packs<00:02:33.560> and<00:02:34.560> that's<00:02:34.830> the<00:02:35.040> only<00:02:35.250> reason

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:35.550 
put two packs and that's the only reason

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:38.320 
put two packs and that's the only reason
I<00:02:35.610> bought<00:02:35.790> the<00:02:36.030> unflavored<00:02:36.510> gelatin<00:02:37.260> is<00:02:37.500> um

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:38.330 
I bought the unflavored gelatin is um

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:41.120 
I bought the unflavored gelatin is um
just<00:02:39.330> for<00:02:40.140> the<00:02:40.260> purpose<00:02:40.560> of<00:02:40.650> the<00:02:40.740> protein

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:41.130 
just for the purpose of the protein

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:43.580 
just for the purpose of the protein
treatment<00:02:41.550> now<00:02:42.450> some<00:02:42.690> of<00:02:42.720> you<00:02:42.930> might<00:02:43.110> ask<00:02:43.290> why

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:43.590 
treatment now some of you might ask why

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:46.100 
treatment now some of you might ask why
would<00:02:43.860> you<00:02:44.010> use<00:02:44.450> unflavored<00:02:45.450> gelatin<00:02:45.900> the

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:46.110 
would you use unflavored gelatin the

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:48.170 
would you use unflavored gelatin the
reason<00:02:46.530> you<00:02:46.650> would<00:02:46.830> use<00:02:46.860> unflavored<00:02:47.700> gelatin

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:48.180 
reason you would use unflavored gelatin

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:50.740 
reason you would use unflavored gelatin
is<00:02:48.360> because<00:02:48.720> there<00:02:49.380> is<00:02:49.560> an<00:02:49.710> ingredient<00:02:49.980> in

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:50.750 
is because there is an ingredient in

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:54.320 
is because there is an ingredient in
gelatin<00:02:51.750> hydrolyzed<00:02:52.650> protein<00:02:53.460> that's<00:02:54.090> the

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:54.330 
gelatin hydrolyzed protein that's the

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:56.510 
gelatin hydrolyzed protein that's the
main<00:02:54.540> ingredient<00:02:55.170> in<00:02:55.290> gelatin<00:02:55.770> which<00:02:55.950> is<00:02:56.100> also

00:02:56.510 --> 00:02:56.520 
main ingredient in gelatin which is also

00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:58.760 
main ingredient in gelatin which is also
the<00:02:57.090> main<00:02:57.330> ingredient<00:02:57.900> in<00:02:58.050> the<00:02:58.080> athletic

00:02:58.760 --> 00:02:58.770 
the main ingredient in the athletic

00:02:58.770 --> 00:03:00.950 
the main ingredient in the athletic
protein<00:02:59.160> treatment<00:02:59.610> so<00:03:00.120> if<00:03:00.300> you<00:03:00.420> can<00:03:00.600> use<00:03:00.750> the

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:00.960 
protein treatment so if you can use the

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:03.110 
protein treatment so if you can use the
Appaji<00:03:01.380> protein<00:03:01.830> treatment<00:03:02.310> for<00:03:02.820> the

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:03.120 
Appaji protein treatment for the

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:05.900 
Appaji protein treatment for the
hydrolyzed<00:03:03.720> protein<00:03:04.560> you<00:03:05.010> can<00:03:05.220> also<00:03:05.400> just<00:03:05.790> use

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:05.910 
hydrolyzed protein you can also just use

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:08.660 
hydrolyzed protein you can also just use
the<00:03:06.240> regular<00:03:07.110> gelatin<00:03:07.860> that<00:03:07.890> already<00:03:08.310> has<00:03:08.490> it

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:08.670 
the regular gelatin that already has it

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:11.870 
the regular gelatin that already has it
in<00:03:08.790> it<00:03:09.320> so<00:03:10.320> I'm<00:03:10.470> going<00:03:10.680> to<00:03:10.710> take<00:03:11.010> some<00:03:11.580> of<00:03:11.760> the

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:11.880 
in it so I'm going to take some of the

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:19.580 
in it so I'm going to take some of the
mayonnaise<00:03:13.820> actually<00:03:17.540> just<00:03:18.540> put<00:03:19.170> that<00:03:19.380> in

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:19.590 
mayonnaise actually just put that in

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:23.780 
mayonnaise actually just put that in
there<00:03:20.720> and<00:03:21.720> normally<00:03:22.170> I<00:03:22.200> don't<00:03:22.320> use<00:03:22.790> edible

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:23.790 
there and normally I don't use edible

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:25.580 
there and normally I don't use edible
ingredients<00:03:24.480> in<00:03:24.600> the<00:03:24.720> bathroom<00:03:25.170> but<00:03:25.380> my

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:25.590 
ingredients in the bathroom but my

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:30.470 
ingredients in the bathroom but my
lighting<00:03:26.010> is<00:03:26.160> better<00:03:27.110> in<00:03:28.110> the<00:03:28.380> bathroom<00:03:29.480> so

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:30.480 
lighting is better in the bathroom so

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:36.780 
lighting is better in the bathroom so
I'm<00:03:30.570> going<00:03:30.810> to<00:03:30.840> mix<00:03:31.080> all<00:03:31.440> of<00:03:31.500> this<00:03:32.220> up<00:03:32.460> Oh

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:36.790 

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:39.210 

like<00:03:37.540> I'm<00:03:37.720> going<00:03:37.840> to<00:03:37.900> put<00:03:38.140> a<00:03:38.170> little<00:03:38.650> bit<00:03:39.159> more

00:03:39.210 --> 00:03:39.220 
like I'm going to put a little bit more

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:47.320 
like I'm going to put a little bit more
water<00:03:39.640> in<00:03:39.909> there

00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:47.330 

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:49.450 

and<00:03:47.870> as<00:03:48.020> you<00:03:48.230> can<00:03:48.380> see<00:03:48.440> right<00:03:48.890> here<00:03:49.160> on<00:03:49.310> the

00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:49.460 
and as you can see right here on the

00:03:49.460 --> 00:03:51.400 
and as you can see right here on the
brush<00:03:49.760> you<00:03:50.000> can<00:03:50.180> see<00:03:50.210> the<00:03:50.600> gelatin<00:03:51.140> getting

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:51.410 
brush you can see the gelatin getting

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:53.860 
brush you can see the gelatin getting
hard<00:03:51.880> so<00:03:52.880> I'm<00:03:52.970> going<00:03:53.120> to<00:03:53.180> add<00:03:53.270> a<00:03:53.300> little<00:03:53.630> more

00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:53.870 
hard so I'm going to add a little more

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:57.580 
hard so I'm going to add a little more
water<00:03:54.170> so<00:03:54.500> it<00:03:54.620> dissolves<00:03:55.190> the<00:03:55.280> gelatin<00:03:56.590> and

00:03:57.580 --> 00:03:57.590 
water so it dissolves the gelatin and

00:03:57.590 --> 00:03:59.760 
water so it dissolves the gelatin and
gets<00:03:58.070> mixed<00:03:58.400> up<00:03:58.730> really<00:03:59.180> well

00:03:59.760 --> 00:03:59.770 
gets mixed up really well

00:03:59.770 --> 00:04:14.000 
gets mixed up really well
and<00:04:00.770> while<00:04:01.100> I'm<00:04:01.280> making<00:04:01.460> a<00:04:01.700> mess<00:04:01.940> Oh

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:14.010 

00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:16.460 

I'm<00:04:14.490> add<00:04:14.670> a<00:04:14.700> little<00:04:15.150> bit<00:04:15.450> more<00:04:15.480> conditioner

00:04:16.460 --> 00:04:16.470 
I'm add a little bit more conditioner

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:22.099 
I'm add a little bit more conditioner
just<00:04:16.500> to<00:04:16.889> thicken<00:04:17.130> it<00:04:17.400> up

00:04:22.099 --> 00:04:22.109 

00:04:22.109 --> 00:04:25.670 

okay<00:04:23.099> so<00:04:23.159> I<00:04:23.430> have<00:04:23.909> finished<00:04:24.360> mixing<00:04:24.990> up<00:04:25.199> all<00:04:25.409> of

00:04:25.670 --> 00:04:25.680 
okay so I have finished mixing up all of

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:29.210 
okay so I have finished mixing up all of
the<00:04:25.830> ingredients<00:04:26.699> and<00:04:27.319> it's<00:04:28.319> a<00:04:28.500> little<00:04:28.800> watery

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:29.220 
the ingredients and it's a little watery

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:31.129 
the ingredients and it's a little watery
but<00:04:29.520> you<00:04:29.639> can<00:04:29.789> still<00:04:30.090> see<00:04:30.330> some<00:04:30.360> of<00:04:30.719> the<00:04:30.780> chunks

00:04:31.129 --> 00:04:31.139 
but you can still see some of the chunks

00:04:31.139 --> 00:04:33.920 
but you can still see some of the chunks
of<00:04:31.259> the<00:04:31.379> gelatin<00:04:31.919> right<00:04:32.159> here<00:04:32.539> so<00:04:33.539> what<00:04:33.840> I'm

00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:33.930 
of the gelatin right here so what I'm

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:36.170 
of the gelatin right here so what I'm
going<00:04:34.050> to<00:04:34.110> do<00:04:34.379> is<00:04:34.770> apply<00:04:35.099> all<00:04:35.849> of<00:04:36.060> the

00:04:36.170 --> 00:04:36.180 
going to do is apply all of the

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:38.480 
going to do is apply all of the
treatment<00:04:36.629> to<00:04:36.659> my<00:04:36.900> hair<00:04:37.259> I<00:04:37.500> will<00:04:38.129> come<00:04:38.340> back

00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:38.490 
treatment to my hair I will come back

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:40.309 
treatment to my hair I will come back
and<00:04:38.729> show<00:04:38.879> you<00:04:38.909> guys<00:04:39.270> what<00:04:39.629> the<00:04:39.750> product<00:04:40.139> looks

00:04:40.309 --> 00:04:40.319 
and show you guys what the product looks

00:04:40.319 --> 00:04:43.159 
and show you guys what the product looks
like<00:04:40.530> in<00:04:40.680> my<00:04:40.800> hair<00:04:41.039> and<00:04:41.280> then<00:04:41.870> after<00:04:42.870> that<00:04:42.990> I'm

00:04:43.159 --> 00:04:43.169 
like in my hair and then after that I'm

00:04:43.169 --> 00:04:44.779 
like in my hair and then after that I'm
going<00:04:43.319> to<00:04:43.349> set<00:04:43.620> under<00:04:43.800> the<00:04:43.919> DRAM<00:04:44.280> bag<00:04:44.520> so<00:04:44.759> I

00:04:44.779 --> 00:04:44.789 
going to set under the DRAM bag so I

00:04:44.789 --> 00:04:47.390 
going to set under the DRAM bag so I
applied<00:04:45.270> all<00:04:45.569> of<00:04:45.599> the<00:04:46.020> protein<00:04:46.919> treatment<00:04:47.280> to

00:04:47.390 --> 00:04:47.400 
applied all of the protein treatment to

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:49.330 
applied all of the protein treatment to
my<00:04:47.550> hair<00:04:47.819> so<00:04:48.150> this<00:04:48.360> is<00:04:48.539> what<00:04:48.719> it<00:04:48.840> looks<00:04:49.020> like

00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:49.340 
my hair so this is what it looks like

00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:54.980 
my hair so this is what it looks like
with<00:04:50.340> all<00:04:50.580> of<00:04:50.969> the<00:04:52.099> protein<00:04:53.990> treatment

00:04:54.980 --> 00:04:54.990 
with all of the protein treatment

00:04:54.990 --> 00:04:58.490 
with all of the protein treatment
applied<00:04:56.240> and<00:04:57.240> what<00:04:57.449> I<00:04:57.479> forgot<00:04:57.840> to<00:04:58.020> mention<00:04:58.199> is

00:04:58.490 --> 00:04:58.500 
applied and what I forgot to mention is

00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:01.550 
applied and what I forgot to mention is
that<00:04:58.710> before<00:04:59.250> you<00:04:59.639> apply<00:05:00.000> the<00:05:00.560> protein

00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:01.560 
that before you apply the protein

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:02.930 
that before you apply the protein
treatment<00:05:01.919> to<00:05:02.009> your<00:05:02.039> hair<00:05:02.370> you<00:05:02.520> should<00:05:02.639> always

00:05:02.930 --> 00:05:02.940 
treatment to your hair you should always

00:05:02.940 --> 00:05:06.140 
treatment to your hair you should always
start<00:05:03.479> a<00:05:03.629> freshly<00:05:04.199> washed<00:05:04.409> hair<00:05:04.909> because<00:05:05.909> that

00:05:06.140 --> 00:05:06.150 
start a freshly washed hair because that

00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:07.640 
start a freshly washed hair because that
way<00:05:06.330> you've<00:05:06.629> gotten<00:05:07.080> rid<00:05:07.199> of<00:05:07.289> all<00:05:07.469> the

00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:07.650 
way you've gotten rid of all the

00:05:07.650 --> 00:05:09.649 
way you've gotten rid of all the
build-up<00:05:08.039> and<00:05:08.219> then<00:05:08.550> your<00:05:08.969> hair<00:05:09.210> is<00:05:09.419> more

00:05:09.649 --> 00:05:09.659 
build-up and then your hair is more

00:05:09.659 --> 00:05:11.869 
build-up and then your hair is more
likely<00:05:10.080> to<00:05:10.110> absorb<00:05:10.650> the<00:05:10.949> maximum<00:05:11.129> amount<00:05:11.729> of

00:05:11.869 --> 00:05:11.879 
likely to absorb the maximum amount of

00:05:11.879 --> 00:05:13.879 
likely to absorb the maximum amount of
protein<00:05:12.360> if<00:05:12.629> it's<00:05:12.810> completely<00:05:13.349> clean
