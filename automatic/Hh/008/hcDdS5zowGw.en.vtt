 standard for water and dust

 I find at least the two numbers 57 are i 

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:19.439
 relative standards for water and dust 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:22.920

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:47.689
 there are nfc tags that the only other one 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:51.710
 which we might expect 

00:01:47.689 --> 00:01:54.470
 this is the low smartphone we extract 

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:56.759
 this is quite a curious design 

00:01:54.470 --> 00:02:00.210
 species of curvatures of the old 

00:01:56.759 --> 00:02:02.369

 above always under a rubber pad because 

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:25.370
 obviously a certified smartphone 

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:25.880
 to resist water there is a jack 

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:27.830
