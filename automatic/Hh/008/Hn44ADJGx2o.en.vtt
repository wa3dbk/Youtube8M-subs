00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:16.510 
chest the way it is so i'm just going to

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:19.410 
chest the way it is so i'm just going to
focus<00:02:16.720> on<00:02:17.250> bulking<00:02:18.250> and<00:02:18.610> then<00:02:18.760> cutting<00:02:19.090> and

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:19.420 
focus on bulking and then cutting and

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:21.090 
focus on bulking and then cutting and
not<00:02:19.540> worry<00:02:19.840> too<00:02:19.930> much<00:02:20.110> about<00:02:20.260> my<00:02:20.620> chest<00:02:20.860> and

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:21.100 
not worry too much about my chest and

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:23.210 
not worry too much about my chest and
just<00:02:21.220> let<00:02:21.459> time<00:02:21.730> heal<00:02:21.760> it<00:02:22.300> instead<00:02:22.690> of<00:02:22.750> the<00:02:22.900> gym

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:23.220 
just let time heal it instead of the gym

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:31.560 
just let time heal it instead of the gym
so<00:02:24.220> this<00:02:24.580> is<00:02:24.610> it<00:02:24.910> soft<00:02:25.330> I<00:02:27.780> guess<00:02:29.970> yeah<00:02:30.970> I<00:02:31.330> don't

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:31.570 
so this is it soft I guess yeah I don't

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:32.310 
so this is it soft I guess yeah I don't
think<00:02:31.690> there's<00:02:31.840> that<00:02:31.900> much<00:02:32.110> of<00:02:32.230> a<00:02:32.290> difference

think there's that much of a difference

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:34.020 
think there's that much of a difference
