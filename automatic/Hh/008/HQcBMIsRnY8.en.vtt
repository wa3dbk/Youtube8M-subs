the martial art side of things you know
bitter<00:02:02.460> self-defense<00:02:03.060> but<00:02:03.270> it<00:02:03.660> looked<00:02:03.780> like

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:03.870 
bitter self-defense but it looked like

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:05.600 
bitter self-defense but it looked like
fun<00:02:04.080> I<00:02:04.350> mean<00:02:04.560> it's<00:02:04.710> always<00:02:05.160> a<00:02:05.250> little<00:02:05.340> bit<00:02:05.520> more

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:05.610 
fun I mean it's always a little bit more

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:10.490 
fun I mean it's always a little bit more
fun<00:02:05.820> with<00:02:06.000> you<00:02:06.800> martial<00:02:07.800> arts<00:02:07.910> group<00:02:08.910> and<00:02:09.750> you

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:10.500 
fun with you martial arts group and you

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:13.280 
fun with you martial arts group and you
you<00:02:10.890> know<00:02:10.979> there's<00:02:11.220> basic<00:02:11.610> stances<00:02:12.060> which<00:02:12.630> you

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:13.290 
you know there's basic stances which you

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:15.650 
you know there's basic stances which you
quite<00:02:13.670> quite<00:02:14.670> hard<00:02:14.910> to<00:02:15.000> do<00:02:15.150> so<00:02:15.360> that's<00:02:15.540> what

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:15.660 
quite quite hard to do so that's what

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:18.230 
quite quite hard to do so that's what
you<00:02:15.750> have<00:02:15.900> to<00:02:15.930> sustain<00:02:16.260> so<00:02:16.980> I<00:02:17.490> think<00:02:17.640> the<00:02:18.120> way

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:18.240 
you have to sustain so I think the way

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:19.730 
you have to sustain so I think the way
that<00:02:18.270> we<00:02:18.510> train<00:02:18.810> was<00:02:19.020> sustaining<00:02:19.530> what<00:02:19.650> we

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:19.740 
that we train was sustaining what we

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:21.410 
that we train was sustaining what we
call<00:02:19.890> horse<00:02:20.100> stance<00:02:20.400> so<00:02:20.640> imagine<00:02:21.060> riding<00:02:21.210> on<00:02:21.360> a

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:21.420 
call horse stance so imagine riding on a

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:22.670 
call horse stance so imagine riding on a
horse<00:02:21.570> and<00:02:21.690> sustaining<00:02:22.260> that<00:02:22.380> for<00:02:22.530> a<00:02:22.590> long

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:22.680 
horse and sustaining that for a long

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:24.110 
horse and sustaining that for a long
period<00:02:22.800> of<00:02:22.950> time<00:02:23.040> that's<00:02:23.340> the<00:02:23.490> basis<00:02:23.880> of<00:02:24.000> the

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:24.120 
period of time that's the basis of the

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:25.850 
period of time that's the basis of the
whole<00:02:24.300> liners<00:02:25.170> but<00:02:25.200> you<00:02:25.440> also<00:02:25.590> have<00:02:25.770> to<00:02:25.800> have

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:25.860 
whole liners but you also have to have

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:28.340 
whole liners but you also have to have
agility<00:02:26.340> okay<00:02:27.270> and<00:02:27.600> that's<00:02:27.810> a<00:02:27.930> lot<00:02:28.080> of<00:02:28.110> you

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:28.350 
agility okay and that's a lot of you

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:30.620 
agility okay and that's a lot of you
know<00:02:28.470> when<00:02:28.590> you're<00:02:28.770> lifting<00:02:29.300> so<00:02:30.300> the<00:02:30.420> tail<00:02:30.600> off

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:30.630 
know when you're lifting so the tail off

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:32.300 
know when you're lifting so the tail off
it<00:02:30.959> obviously<00:02:31.380> has<00:02:31.500> to<00:02:31.530> lift<00:02:31.770> the<00:02:31.890> line<00:02:32.040> head

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:32.310 
it obviously has to lift the line head

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:34.640 
it obviously has to lift the line head
but<00:02:32.760> you<00:02:32.820> also<00:02:32.910> to<00:02:33.090> be<00:02:33.480> very<00:02:33.720> light<00:02:34.350> on<00:02:34.560> your

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:37.430 
but you also to be very light on your
feet<00:02:34.860> very<00:02:35.100> active<00:02:35.670> so<00:02:36.000> because<00:02:36.750> ideally<00:02:37.140> the

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:37.440 
feet very active so because ideally the

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:40.730 
feet very active so because ideally the
line<00:02:37.590> has<00:02:37.980> to<00:02:38.010> bring<00:02:38.700> alive<00:02:38.970> a<00:02:39.420> lion<00:02:40.020> you<00:02:40.620> know

emotions that we feel it's humans so on

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:46.729 
emotions that we feel it's humans so on
the<00:02:45.300> line<00:02:45.450> has<00:02:45.630> to<00:02:45.660> be<00:02:45.810> also<00:02:45.989> be<00:02:46.110> very<00:02:46.440> creative

00:02:46.729 --> 00:02:46.739 
the line has to be also be very creative

00:02:46.739 --> 00:02:48.979 
the line has to be also be very creative
as<00:02:47.190> well<00:02:47.430> and<00:02:48.270> when<00:02:48.390> you're<00:02:48.480> actually<00:02:48.630> in<00:02:48.810> the

00:02:48.979 --> 00:02:48.989 
as well and when you're actually in the

00:02:48.989 --> 00:02:51.350 
as well and when you're actually in the
line<00:02:49.170> it's<00:02:49.800> so<00:02:50.489> you<00:02:50.550> have<00:02:50.730> to<00:02:50.820> have<00:02:50.940> strength

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:51.360 
line it's so you have to have strength

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:52.580 
line it's so you have to have strength
and<00:02:51.510> you<00:02:51.600> have<00:02:51.690> to<00:02:51.840> have<00:02:51.959> endurance<00:02:52.380> because

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:52.590 
and you have to have endurance because

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:54.890 
and you have to have endurance because
sometimes<00:02:53.459> especially<00:02:53.670> in<00:02:54.000> Australia<00:02:54.450> we're

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:54.900 
sometimes especially in Australia we're

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:57.199 
sometimes especially in Australia we're
performing<00:02:55.260> during<00:02:55.440> summer<00:02:55.739> 40<00:02:56.550> degree<00:02:56.880> heat

00:02:57.199 --> 00:02:57.209 
performing during summer 40 degree heat

00:02:57.209 --> 00:03:00.229 
performing during summer 40 degree heat
in<00:02:57.570> a<00:02:57.900> line<00:02:58.110> so<00:02:58.620> I'll<00:02:59.010> say<00:02:59.370> you're<00:02:59.519> it's<00:02:59.940> very

00:03:00.229 --> 00:03:00.239 
in a line so I'll say you're it's very

00:03:00.239 --> 00:03:02.930 
in a line so I'll say you're it's very
claustrophobic<00:03:00.540> and<00:03:01.080> stuff<00:03:01.320> in<00:03:01.470> the<00:03:01.590> line<00:03:01.940> and

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:02.940 
claustrophobic and stuff in the line and

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:05.870 
claustrophobic and stuff in the line and
but<00:03:03.870> it's<00:03:04.800> kind<00:03:05.100> of<00:03:05.160> like<00:03:05.310> every<00:03:05.580> time<00:03:05.760> you

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:05.880 
but it's kind of like every time you

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:07.280 
but it's kind of like every time you
play<00:03:06.000> a<00:03:06.060> sport<00:03:06.360> you<00:03:06.480> have<00:03:06.510> an<00:03:06.690> adrenaline<00:03:07.170> rush

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:07.290 
play a sport you have an adrenaline rush

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:09.380 
play a sport you have an adrenaline rush
so<00:03:07.680> I<00:03:07.739> liken<00:03:08.519> it<00:03:08.580> to<00:03:08.640> that<00:03:08.940> you<00:03:09.060> get<00:03:09.180> at<00:03:09.300> this

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:09.390 
so I liken it to that you get at this

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:11.210 
so I liken it to that you get at this
adrenaline<00:03:09.720> rush<00:03:09.989> about<00:03:10.140> 10-15<00:03:10.739> minutes<00:03:11.040> and

00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:11.220 
adrenaline rush about 10-15 minutes and

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:13.280 
adrenaline rush about 10-15 minutes and
you<00:03:11.280> just<00:03:11.400> go<00:03:11.519> all<00:03:11.670> out<00:03:11.700> to<00:03:12.060> bring<00:03:12.420> a<00:03:12.480> live<00:03:12.660> this

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:13.290 
you just go all out to bring a live this

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:16.370 
you just go all out to bring a live this
story<00:03:13.590> behind<00:03:14.040> the<00:03:14.280> line<00:03:14.459> is<00:03:15.380> there's
