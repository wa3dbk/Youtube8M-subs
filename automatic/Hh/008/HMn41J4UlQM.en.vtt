magazine<00:02:27.350> has<00:02:27.470> now<00:02:27.620> got<00:02:27.800> there<00:02:27.950> at<00:02:28.040> the<00:02:28.130> TV

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:28.310 
magazine has now got there at the TV

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:30.580 
magazine has now got there at the TV
station<00:02:28.459> so<00:02:28.940> we<00:02:28.970> knew<00:02:29.300> that<00:02:29.570> we<00:02:30.080> were<00:02:30.170> in<00:02:30.290> safe

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:30.590 
station so we knew that we were in safe

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:33.970 
station so we knew that we were in safe
hands<00:02:30.860> but<00:02:31.280> when<00:02:32.060> we<00:02:32.209> actually<00:02:32.500> became<00:02:33.500> the

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:33.980 
hands but when we actually became the

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:36.430 
hands but when we actually became the
subject<00:02:34.250> of<00:02:34.670> our<00:02:34.760> own<00:02:34.940> experiment<00:02:35.720> we<00:02:36.320> were

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:36.440 
subject of our own experiment we were

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:39.220 
subject of our own experiment we were
almost<00:02:36.620> complicit<00:02:37.520> in<00:02:37.700> this<00:02:38.150> crazy<00:02:38.570> analysis

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:39.230 
almost complicit in this crazy analysis

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:41.199 
almost complicit in this crazy analysis
and<00:02:39.440> it<00:02:40.070> was<00:02:40.190> really<00:02:40.400> hard<00:02:40.640> to<00:02:40.730> open<00:02:40.940> up

00:02:41.199 --> 00:02:41.209 
and it was really hard to open up

00:02:41.209 --> 00:02:43.390 
and it was really hard to open up
because<00:02:41.570> initially<00:02:41.840> we<00:02:42.620> started<00:02:42.650> off<00:02:43.160> as<00:02:43.310> a

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:43.400 
because initially we started off as a

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:45.100 
because initially we started off as a
kind<00:02:43.550> of<00:02:43.580> a<00:02:43.670> fairly<00:02:43.970> light<00:02:44.180> decorating<00:02:44.870> show

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:45.110 
kind of a fairly light decorating show

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:47.020 
kind of a fairly light decorating show
because<00:02:45.620> we<00:02:45.769> ripped<00:02:46.040> yourselves<00:02:46.489> from<00:02:46.760> a

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:47.030 
because we ripped yourselves from a

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:48.759 
because we ripped yourselves from a
restrained<00:02:47.959> world<00:02:48.230> where<00:02:48.500> we<00:02:48.590> talk<00:02:48.709> about

00:02:48.759 --> 00:02:48.769 
restrained world where we talk about

00:02:48.769 --> 00:02:50.949 
restrained world where we talk about
other<00:02:49.040> people's<00:02:49.400> houses<00:02:49.610> and<00:02:49.940> we<00:02:50.720> actually

00:02:50.949 --> 00:02:50.959 
other people's houses and we actually

00:02:50.959 --> 00:02:53.020 
other people's houses and we actually
put<00:02:51.410> the<00:02:51.470> microscope<00:02:51.950> in<00:02:52.070> ourselves<00:02:52.400> and<00:02:52.610> it

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:53.030 
put the microscope in ourselves and it

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:54.520 
put the microscope in ourselves and it
was<00:02:53.180> really<00:02:53.660> hard<00:02:53.870> i<00:02:54.019> mean<00:02:54.140> i<00:02:54.170> don't<00:02:54.350> want<00:02:54.470> to

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:54.530 
was really hard i mean i don't want to

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:56.830 
was really hard i mean i don't want to
play<00:02:54.620> the<00:02:54.769> martyr<00:02:54.980> but<00:02:55.400> we<00:02:56.000> cried<00:02:56.330> virtually
