00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.470
 so we are already our big ones 

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:07.410
 moment comes closer the thing is always 

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:09.210
 not yet packed, he can do it once 

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:10.910
 a cable or something is loose 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:15.020
 In the back we only have ours 

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:20.220
 power cable down in mouse keyboard and 

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:24.630
 mini hdmi to hdmi port for monitor 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:26.730
 the whole thing goes then mouse keyboard and 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:29.369
 I still test that with the old one 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:32.009
 screen like a 27 inch acer 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:41.340
 so here and now come press 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:48.000
 on it and nothing is fan once ok 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:49.770
 and hallelujah, that's worth it 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:53.219
 shows us cottbus and then reports 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:56.340
 Of course, nothing to find 

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:59.969
 very nice so it will hear you again 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:03.059
 then on, everything turns on 

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:09.840
 Upper fan works cpu fan 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:12.689
 it also turns in the front 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:17.640
 it rotates everywhere the front 

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:22.350
 buttons have ours ours 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:23.850
 drive also has electricity very nice like that 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:29.310
 it was here apparently not yet 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:30.420
 But the status LEDs are right 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:32.280
 and off switch already has 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:40.110
 works if they work here 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:42.659
 if you can see it when i am on the 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:45.860
 monitor has gone black for a while 

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:48.930
 reset button works very well too 

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:51.960
 and again too slowly to get into the bios 

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:54.210
 But we'll do it the same way 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:56.850
 often fitch the thing then synonymous directly 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:59.009
 working out again works as the only one 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:02.550
 times have to look in the status leds 

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:04.690
 and as I said the connections 

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:07.410
 Now you see me very much 

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:07.410
