00:00:01.950 --> 00:00:04.610
 Hello 

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:18.870
 I have 4 vases all different shapes 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:22.140
 these glass products blown by 

00:00:18.870 --> 00:00:24.390
 Very tall delgadito is open on 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:28.940
 short guy will come all of himself for the 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:28.940
 polarity because I in the house 

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:51.230
 I like to think that things and we are 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:51.230
 taking vases 

00:00:53.410 --> 00:01:02.550
 copper plated and we are using three 

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:02.550
 types 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:24.310
 but actually you put it 

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:24.310
 we do not count it ok these pretty 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:31.050
 If I put them right now, the water goes to 

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:36.620
 notice do not tell me later that I do not 

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:36.620
 I told you you have to fill them with water 

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:48.079
 what better the planes with much 

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:48.079
 dedication 

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:53.799
 a good syringe you know 

00:01:55.719 --> 00:02:01.960
 but a very good tour because if you do not 

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:04.909
 loose we can water you vain drops 

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:09.050
 you have to fill one by one the 

00:02:04.909 --> 00:02:12.050
 spheres of water and after putting the 

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:15.890
 water for things I recommend you to 

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:20.540
 chance this you do not fight and where you 

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:24.890
 you're less fat with gerbera with 

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:30.549
 salt what I find red flowers by the 

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:30.549
 color you want if we put the spheres 

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:44.080
 and look a lot 

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:46.570
 the light is called the little things to hang 

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:51.640
 everyone is thinking with this woman that 

00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:55.470
 hands have breaks because fill 

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:59.540
 crystal spheres if it's another matter 

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:59.540
 while it breaks nothing else 

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:08.600
 plastic balls 

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:22.070
 then we have 

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:35.060
 the slats are very stately very 

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:38.170
 I really like these parents because 

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:38.170
 they are wired 

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:47.720
 father at this time we are not going to 

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:50.540
 but I will accompany them and 

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:53.320
 sitel has been teaching the arrangement what 

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:53.320
 we will accompany 

00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:07.280
 white and clean and accounts 

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:10.360
 yellow because I want it to be 

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:10.360
 reflect light 

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:15.920
 I will want that in addition to the light that 

00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:18.620
 they will handle the spheres of light for 

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:20.950
 fix the water of all that game we have 

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:26.500
 the lights below 

00:04:20.950 --> 00:04:29.120
 ok we will extend the parents and 

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:31.180
 last we are going to put them 

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:40.360
 the roses already 

00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:45.300
 then we are going to make the arrangements but 

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:52.660
 the joke is like, and there it goes, it flies you 

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:55.720
 that I eat rice or all things 

00:04:52.660 --> 00:04:59.850
 it's already changed hydrated are looking 

00:04:55.720 --> 00:04:59.850
 that the compresses this morning 

00:04:59.920 --> 00:05:06.060
 and then let's make some women 

00:05:10.140 --> 00:05:13.140
 66 

00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:23.870
 because they are so high 

00:05:19.780 --> 00:05:33.380
 because here the idea of flowers 

00:05:23.870 --> 00:05:35.870
 it's all flower house and the 

00:05:33.380 --> 00:05:38.720
 nature arrives alone 

00:05:35.870 --> 00:05:42.320
 and it is what is very rich according to me and that 

00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:47.600
 it's going to be the concept of my arrangement 

00:05:42.320 --> 00:05:54.220
 really never 

00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:54.220
 and then you're going to fix something like that 

00:05:54.370 --> 00:05:59.320
 very very stretched 

00:06:01.689 --> 00:06:08.649
 I like to think these I'm going to put 

00:06:05.649 --> 00:06:11.139
 very stops 

00:06:08.649 --> 00:06:14.660
 and the courts 

00:06:11.139 --> 00:06:17.249
 to make a world 

00:06:14.660 --> 00:06:20.200
 if the buoys daughters 

00:06:17.249 --> 00:06:22.390
 but the consent with him 

00:06:20.200 --> 00:06:24.400
 the league you can put a little bit of 

00:06:22.390 --> 00:06:27.810
 coloring so you do not see the league 

00:06:24.400 --> 00:06:27.810
 but I do not see it here 

00:06:27.950 --> 00:06:35.289
 the little 

00:06:31.199 --> 00:06:37.979
 the naughty one with all the little ones of 

00:06:35.289 --> 00:06:37.979
 the houses 

00:06:44.060 --> 00:06:48.940
 taking care that you do not see is not 

00:06:46.310 --> 00:06:48.940
 too 

00:06:51.120 --> 00:06:54.419
 these 3 

00:06:54.780 --> 00:06:59.460
 It's not the messy house 

00:07:03.830 --> 00:07:13.969
 let's see 

00:07:06.529 --> 00:07:16.699
 2 reach more layers and has already shown in 

00:07:13.969 --> 00:07:18.139
 the high ones we are going to 

00:07:16.699 --> 00:07:21.190
 check 

00:07:18.139 --> 00:07:26.020
 I believe that directly 

00:07:21.190 --> 00:07:29.440
 and dining because I want to see them but 

00:07:26.020 --> 00:07:32.760
 get and arrange so rich so different 

00:07:29.440 --> 00:07:32.760
 and rebel 

00:07:33.750 --> 00:07:36.750
