those 10 minutes you can decide whether

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:29.160 
those 10 minutes you can decide whether
or<00:01:27.700> not<00:01:27.850> your<00:01:28.150> dough<00:01:28.390> is<00:01:28.630> a<00:01:28.659> little<00:01:28.900> bit<00:01:28.990> on<00:01:29.080> the

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:29.170 
or not your dough is a little bit on the

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:32.370 
or not your dough is a little bit on the
dry<00:01:29.380> side<00:01:29.409> or<00:01:29.979> if<00:01:30.369> it's<00:01:30.790> too<00:01:31.479> wet<00:01:31.750> if<00:01:32.050> it's<00:01:32.229> too

00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:32.380 
dry side or if it's too wet if it's too

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:33.330 
dry side or if it's too wet if it's too
wet<00:01:32.530> you're<00:01:32.680> going<00:01:32.800> to<00:01:32.860> want<00:01:33.040> to<00:01:33.100> add<00:01:33.159> more

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:33.340 
wet you're going to want to add more

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:35.550 
wet you're going to want to add more
flour<00:01:33.610> if<00:01:33.880> it's<00:01:34.030> too<00:01:34.210> dry<00:01:34.390> go<00:01:34.780> ahead<00:01:34.960> and<00:01:35.140> add<00:01:35.290> a

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:35.560 
flour if it's too dry go ahead and add a

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:40.080 
flour if it's too dry go ahead and add a
little<00:01:35.770> bit<00:01:35.950> more<00:01:36.220> water<00:01:37.860> okay<00:01:38.860> so<00:01:39.039> this<00:01:39.910> is

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:40.090 
little bit more water okay so this is

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:41.400 
little bit more water okay so this is
where<00:01:40.210> I<00:01:40.240> would<00:01:40.330> leave<00:01:40.509> it<00:01:40.630> for<00:01:40.960> about<00:01:41.110> 10

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:41.410 
where I would leave it for about 10

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:44.430 
where I would leave it for about 10
minutes<00:01:41.590> to<00:01:41.860> absorb<00:01:42.149> if<00:01:43.149> I<00:01:43.780> wanted<00:01:44.020> to<00:01:44.080> after

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:44.440 
minutes to absorb if I wanted to after

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:46.499 
minutes to absorb if I wanted to after
my<00:01:44.560> 10<00:01:44.740> minutes<00:01:45.039> I<00:01:45.160> could<00:01:45.640> transfer<00:01:46.030> this<00:01:46.300> to<00:01:46.479> a

00:01:46.499 --> 00:01:46.509 
my 10 minutes I could transfer this to a

00:01:46.509 --> 00:01:48.930 
my 10 minutes I could transfer this to a
stand<00:01:46.780> mixer<00:01:46.960> and<00:01:47.380> let<00:01:47.979> it<00:01:48.100> work<00:01:48.310> for<00:01:48.670> about
