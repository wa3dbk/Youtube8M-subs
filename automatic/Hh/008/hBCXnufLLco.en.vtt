00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.969 

here's<00:00:00.630> the<00:00:00.780> final<00:00:01.020> step<00:00:01.380> solving<00:00:01.860> the

00:00:01.969 --> 00:00:01.979 
here's the final step solving the

00:00:01.979 --> 00:00:04.519 
here's the final step solving the
Rubik's<00:00:02.280> Cube<00:00:02.520> revenge<00:00:02.820> at<00:00:03.510> this<00:00:03.780> point<00:00:04.020> you

00:00:04.519 --> 00:00:04.529 
Rubik's Cube revenge at this point you

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:06.950 
Rubik's Cube revenge at this point you
should<00:00:04.560> have<00:00:05.089> everything<00:00:06.089> except<00:00:06.720> for<00:00:06.839> the

00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:06.960 
should have everything except for the

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:10.280 
should have everything except for the
centers<00:00:07.350> on<00:00:07.560> four<00:00:07.830> sides<00:00:09.110> the<00:00:10.110> good<00:00:10.260> thing

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:10.290 
centers on four sides the good thing

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:13.190 
centers on four sides the good thing
about<00:00:10.440> getting<00:00:10.710> the<00:00:10.920> center's<00:00:11.280> is<00:00:11.490> it's<00:00:12.480> once

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:13.200 
about getting the center's is it's once

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:17.420 
about getting the center's is it's once
again<00:00:13.290> all<00:00:13.650> logic<00:00:16.190> basically<00:00:17.190> what<00:00:17.340> you're

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:17.430 
again all logic basically what you're

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:20.510 
again all logic basically what you're
doing<00:00:17.490> is<00:00:17.850> half<00:00:18.750> a<00:00:19.020> center<00:00:19.380> swap<00:00:19.650> like<00:00:20.400> you

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:20.520 
doing is half a center swap like you

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:22.730 
doing is half a center swap like you
would<00:00:20.670> with<00:00:21.270> a<00:00:21.300> three<00:00:21.660> by<00:00:21.779> three<00:00:21.810> and<00:00:22.170> then<00:00:22.710> you

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:22.740 
would with a three by three and then you

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:25.580 
would with a three by three and then you
do<00:00:22.920> it<00:00:22.949> backwards<00:00:23.600> a<00:00:24.600> little<00:00:24.900> complicated

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:25.590 
do it backwards a little complicated

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:27.980 
do it backwards a little complicated
little<00:00:26.160> confusing<00:00:26.550> but<00:00:27.510> it<00:00:27.660> gets<00:00:27.779> your

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:27.990 
little confusing but it gets your

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:31.009 
little confusing but it gets your
centers<00:00:28.410> where<00:00:28.920> they<00:00:29.039> need<00:00:29.220> to<00:00:29.250> be<00:00:30.019> although

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:31.019 
centers where they need to be although

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:34.130 
centers where they need to be although
this<00:00:31.199> is<00:00:31.380> a<00:00:31.410> fairly<00:00:32.340> easy<00:00:32.460> step<00:00:33.090> it<00:00:33.630> takes<00:00:33.960> up

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:34.140 
this is a fairly easy step it takes up

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:36.139 
this is a fairly easy step it takes up
about<00:00:34.350> half<00:00:34.860> of<00:00:35.010> your<00:00:35.160> solving<00:00:35.610> time<00:00:35.820> for<00:00:36.090> the

00:00:36.139 --> 00:00:36.149 
about half of your solving time for the

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:37.459 
about half of your solving time for the
four<00:00:36.360> by<00:00:36.480> four<00:00:36.719> just<00:00:37.020> because<00:00:37.170> there<00:00:37.350> are<00:00:37.440> so

00:00:37.459 --> 00:00:37.469 
four by four just because there are so

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:44.090 
four by four just because there are so
many<00:00:37.770> centers<00:00:39.829> so<00:00:40.829> let's<00:00:41.760> see<00:00:42.000> there's<00:00:42.989> a<00:00:43.110> good

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
many centers so let's see there's a good

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:47.840 
many centers so let's see there's a good
center<00:00:44.610> and<00:00:46.100> what<00:00:47.100> you<00:00:47.160> want<00:00:47.309> to<00:00:47.340> do<00:00:47.430> is<00:00:47.550> swap

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850 
center and what you want to do is swap

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:52.310 
center and what you want to do is swap
it<00:00:48.030> with<00:00:48.180> another<00:00:48.510> one<00:00:50.510> let's<00:00:51.510> see<00:00:51.870> I<00:00:51.899> think<00:00:51.989> we

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320 
it with another one let's see I think we

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:53.959 
it with another one let's see I think we
should<00:00:52.350> swap<00:00:52.800> it<00:00:52.980> with<00:00:53.010> a<00:00:53.160> yellow<00:00:53.399> because

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969 
should swap it with a yellow because

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:56.330 
should swap it with a yellow because
once<00:00:54.180> a<00:00:54.239> yellow<00:00:54.420> gets<00:00:54.629> down<00:00:54.809> here<00:00:55.050> get<00:00:55.920> yo<00:00:56.100> side

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:56.340 
once a yellow gets down here get yo side

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:59.450 
once a yellow gets down here get yo side
over<00:00:56.489> here<00:00:56.930> white<00:00:57.930> center

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
over here white center

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:04.850 
over here white center
yellow<00:01:00.210> Center<00:01:03.170> skinny<00:01:04.170> sort<00:01:04.440> of<00:01:04.500> tricky<00:01:04.710> to

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
yellow Center skinny sort of tricky to

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:08.200 
yellow Center skinny sort of tricky to
explain<00:01:04.890> i'll<00:01:05.519> see<00:01:05.670> if<00:01:05.729> you<00:01:05.790> can<00:01:05.940> grasp<00:01:06.420> it<00:01:07.010> now

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:08.210 
explain i'll see if you can grasp it now

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:11.260 
explain i'll see if you can grasp it now
since<00:01:09.210> this<00:01:09.510> is<00:01:09.780> one<00:01:10.500> piece<00:01:10.619> you<00:01:10.740> want<00:01:10.830> to<00:01:10.950> get

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:11.270 
since this is one piece you want to get

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:15.080 
since this is one piece you want to get
you<00:01:12.270> won't<00:01:12.630> turn<00:01:12.840> this<00:01:13.020> down<00:01:13.790> you'll<00:01:14.790> see<00:01:14.880> why

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
you won't turn this down you'll see why

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:17.240 
you won't turn this down you'll see why
in<00:01:15.119> a<00:01:15.210> second<00:01:15.450> let's<00:01:15.720> turn<00:01:16.020> if<00:01:16.770> this<00:01:17.040> lice

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
in a second let's turn if this lice

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:19.790 
in a second let's turn if this lice
wants<00:01:17.550> to<00:01:17.640> get<00:01:17.759> up<00:01:17.850> here<00:01:18.200> will<00:01:19.200> turn<00:01:19.409> this

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:19.800 
wants to get up here will turn this

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:24.800 
wants to get up here will turn this
slice<00:01:20.759> down<00:01:21.030> and<00:01:22.130> this<00:01:23.130> one<00:01:23.340> over<00:01:23.509> C<00:01:24.509> a<00:01:24.570> LOX

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
slice down and this one over C a LOX

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:27.980 
slice down and this one over C a LOX
nicely<00:01:25.200> into<00:01:25.380> place<00:01:26.450> now<00:01:27.450> the<00:01:27.509> reason<00:01:27.780> we

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990 
nicely into place now the reason we

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:30.080 
nicely into place now the reason we
don't<00:01:28.170> do<00:01:28.320> with<00:01:28.590> the<00:01:28.649> other<00:01:28.800> slice<00:01:29.190> which<00:01:29.909> as

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
don't do with the other slice which as

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:32.090 
don't do with the other slice which as
we<00:01:30.270> have<00:01:30.360> the<00:01:30.450> center<00:01:30.750> on<00:01:30.810> it<00:01:30.990> it's<00:01:31.470> because<00:01:31.800> it

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 
we have the center on it it's because it

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:36.680 
we have the center on it it's because it
would<00:01:32.220> be<00:01:32.369> displaced<00:01:33.030> and<00:01:35.149> also<00:01:36.149> this<00:01:36.509> one

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:36.690 
would be displaced and also this one

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:38.650 
would be displaced and also this one
we're<00:01:36.869> not<00:01:36.990> getting<00:01:37.200> the<00:01:37.259> right<00:01:37.320> spot

00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:38.660 
we're not getting the right spot

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:42.100 
we're not getting the right spot
sometimes<00:01:39.660> you<00:01:40.110> need<00:01:40.259> to<00:01:40.320> turn<00:01:40.590> the<00:01:40.950> top<00:01:41.130> side

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:42.110 
sometimes you need to turn the top side

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:45.020 
sometimes you need to turn the top side
to<00:01:43.110> make<00:01:43.229> sure<00:01:43.440> the<00:01:43.590> center's<00:01:43.950> don't<00:01:44.250> you<00:01:44.940> know

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.030 
to make sure the center's don't you know

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:48.859 
to make sure the center's don't you know
hit<00:01:45.479> each<00:01:45.600> other<00:01:46.460> but<00:01:47.460> not<00:01:47.880> in<00:01:48.000> this<00:01:48.060> case<00:01:48.119> so

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:48.869 
hit each other but not in this case so

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:52.899 
hit each other but not in this case so
let's<00:01:49.229> turn<00:01:49.560> the<00:01:49.710> slice<00:01:49.950> down

00:01:52.899 --> 00:01:52.909 

00:01:52.909 --> 00:01:56.099 

bring<00:01:53.869> the<00:01:54.049> edge<00:01:54.229> in<00:01:54.590> a<00:01:54.770> place<00:01:55.039> see<00:01:55.579> outfits

00:01:56.099 --> 00:01:56.109 
bring the edge in a place see outfits

00:01:56.109 --> 00:01:58.710 
bring the edge in a place see outfits
and<00:01:57.109> bring<00:01:57.319> it<00:01:57.409> up

00:01:58.710 --> 00:01:58.720 
and bring it up

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:01.230 
and bring it up
now<00:01:59.170> you<00:01:59.770> can<00:01:59.950> see<00:02:00.130> here<00:02:00.460> the<00:02:00.610> two<00:02:00.820> orange

00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:01.240 
now you can see here the two orange

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:03.750 
now you can see here the two orange
edges<00:02:01.630> they<00:02:02.470> will<00:02:02.650> be<00:02:02.770> going<00:02:03.100> back<00:02:03.130> over<00:02:03.460> here

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:03.760 
edges they will be going back over here

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:06.810 
edges they will be going back over here
so<00:02:04.480> turn<00:02:04.750> it<00:02:04.780> so<00:02:05.410> that<00:02:05.560> your<00:02:06.040> other<00:02:06.310> center

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:06.820 
so turn it so that your other center

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:18.400 
so turn it so that your other center
falls<00:02:07.660> into<00:02:07.990> place

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:18.410 

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:20.560 

then<00:02:18.920> just<00:02:19.160> turn<00:02:19.370> the<00:02:19.520> top<00:02:19.700> flow<00:02:20.360> everything

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:20.570 
then just turn the top flow everything

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:24.150 
then just turn the top flow everything
lines<00:02:20.840> up<00:02:20.960> yeah

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:24.160 

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:26.280 

okay<00:02:24.880> I<00:02:25.120> realized<00:02:25.660> this<00:02:25.750> part<00:02:26.020> may<00:02:26.230> be

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:26.290 
okay I realized this part may be

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:28.560 
okay I realized this part may be
incredibly<00:02:26.950> confusing<00:02:27.460> but<00:02:28.180> if<00:02:28.300> I<00:02:28.390> were<00:02:28.450> to

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:28.570 
incredibly confusing but if I were to

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:30.420 
incredibly confusing but if I were to
write<00:02:28.600> out<00:02:28.870> every<00:02:29.350> single<00:02:29.560> algorithm<00:02:30.220> for

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:30.430 
write out every single algorithm for

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:35.010 
write out every single algorithm for
every<00:02:30.670> combination<00:02:30.940> I<00:02:31.450> would<00:02:32.260> have<00:02:34.020> 16

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:35.020 
every combination I would have 16

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:36.720 
every combination I would have 16
algorithms<00:02:35.680> and<00:02:35.860> I'm<00:02:36.130> sure<00:02:36.370> you<00:02:36.460> don't<00:02:36.550> want

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:36.730 
algorithms and I'm sure you don't want

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:40.440 
algorithms and I'm sure you don't want
to<00:02:36.790> memorize<00:02:37.000> 16<00:02:37.600> short<00:02:37.990> algorithms<00:02:39.450> let's

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:40.450 
to memorize 16 short algorithms let's

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:44.160 
to memorize 16 short algorithms let's
see<00:02:40.780> here's<00:02:41.350> another<00:02:41.410> Center<00:02:42.090> there's<00:02:43.090> a<00:02:43.210> good

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:44.170 
see here's another Center there's a good

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:46.770 
see here's another Center there's a good
center<00:02:44.530> switch<00:02:44.770> it<00:02:44.920> with<00:02:45.010> red<00:02:45.580> and<00:02:45.670> white<00:02:45.850> with

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:46.780 
center switch it with red and white with

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:50.580 
center switch it with red and white with
red<00:02:47.020> side<00:02:47.290> Whiteside<00:02:48.660> this<00:02:49.660> when<00:02:50.260> you<00:02:50.350> turn<00:02:50.500> it

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:50.590 
red side Whiteside this when you turn it

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:52.830 
red side Whiteside this when you turn it
will<00:02:50.860> end<00:02:50.980> up<00:02:51.160> over<00:02:51.520> here<00:02:51.550> so<00:02:52.360> we<00:02:52.390> have<00:02:52.570> shirt

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:52.840 
will end up over here so we have shirt

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:57.990 
will end up over here so we have shirt
this<00:02:53.350> slice<00:02:53.620> down

00:02:57.990 --> 00:02:58.000 

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:01.110 

there<00:02:58.570> we<00:02:58.660> go<00:02:58.780> here's<00:02:59.080> the<00:02:59.170> white<00:02:59.290> center

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:01.120 
there we go here's the white center

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:03.210 
there we go here's the white center
now<00:03:01.690> the<00:03:01.750> current<00:03:02.140> so<00:03:02.530> at<00:03:02.590> the<00:03:02.709> white<00:03:02.890> center

00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:03.220 
now the current so at the white center

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:07.649 
now the current so at the white center
falls<00:03:03.519> into<00:03:03.700> place<00:03:03.760> down<00:03:04.180> here<00:03:06.510> rotate<00:03:07.510> it

00:03:07.649 --> 00:03:07.659 
falls into place down here rotate it

00:03:07.659 --> 00:03:14.509 
falls into place down here rotate it
over<00:03:08.500> here<00:03:08.950> bring<00:03:09.909> this<00:03:10.090> up<00:03:11.069> and<00:03:12.209> it's<00:03:13.209> solved

00:03:14.509 --> 00:03:14.519 
over here bring this up and it's solved

00:03:14.519 --> 00:03:16.530 
over here bring this up and it's solved
you<00:03:15.519> will<00:03:15.640> have<00:03:15.730> to<00:03:15.879> figure<00:03:16.060> some<00:03:16.390> of<00:03:16.420> these

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:16.540 
you will have to figure some of these

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:18.119 
you will have to figure some of these
parts<00:03:16.870> out<00:03:17.019> on<00:03:17.200> your<00:03:17.349> own<00:03:17.379> because<00:03:17.709> I<00:03:17.890> can't

00:03:18.119 --> 00:03:18.129 
parts out on your own because I can't

00:03:18.129 --> 00:03:23.990 
parts out on your own because I can't
show<00:03:18.370> you<00:03:18.400> every<00:03:19.000> possible<00:03:19.720> situation<00:03:22.170> okay

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:24.000 
show you every possible situation okay

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.840 
show you every possible situation okay
so<00:03:24.630> let's<00:03:25.020> just<00:03:25.260> blast<00:03:25.860> you<00:03:26.100> sinners<00:03:26.400> in<00:03:26.520> place

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:26.850 
so let's just blast you sinners in place

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:30.550 
so let's just blast you sinners in place
here<00:03:28.040> we'll<00:03:29.040> get<00:03:29.220> pretty<00:03:29.370> quick<00:03:29.580> at<00:03:29.700> this

00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:30.560 
here we'll get pretty quick at this

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:33.170 
here we'll get pretty quick at this
after<00:03:31.560> little<00:03:32.010> practice<00:03:32.370> may<00:03:32.700> be<00:03:32.760> confusing

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:33.180 
after little practice may be confusing

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:50.390 
after little practice may be confusing
now<00:03:33.530> but<00:03:34.530> it<00:03:34.770> should<00:03:35.070> just<00:03:35.310> click

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:50.400 

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:52.399 

I<00:03:50.459> always<00:03:51.120> thought<00:03:51.269> this<00:03:51.450> was<00:03:51.659> most

00:03:52.399 --> 00:03:52.409 
I always thought this was most

00:03:52.409 --> 00:04:04.630 
I always thought this was most
satisfying<00:03:52.860> step<00:03:53.220> mostly<00:03:53.790> it's<00:03:54.030> the<00:03:54.150> last<00:03:54.329> one

00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:04.640 

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:28.270 

you<00:04:05.240> more<00:04:05.510> centers<00:04:05.990> to<00:04:06.170> go

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:28.280 

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:31.360 

ooh<00:04:28.340> now<00:04:29.180> you're<00:04:29.210> tricky<00:04:29.900> situation<00:04:30.470> once

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:31.370 
ooh now you're tricky situation once

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:35.670 
ooh now you're tricky situation once
around<00:04:31.760> one<00:04:31.910> side<00:04:32.920> last<00:04:33.920> center<00:04:34.190> on<00:04:34.280> the<00:04:34.370> other

00:04:35.670 --> 00:04:35.680 
around one side last center on the other

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:38.170 
around one side last center on the other
simple<00:04:36.680> just<00:04:36.950> switch<00:04:37.160> it<00:04:37.190> with<00:04:37.550> center<00:04:37.970> on<00:04:38.150> a

00:04:38.170 --> 00:04:38.180 
simple just switch it with center on a

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:45.970 
simple just switch it with center on a
side<00:04:38.450> in<00:04:38.660> between<00:04:38.750> the<00:04:39.110> two

00:04:45.970 --> 00:04:45.980 

00:04:45.980 --> 00:04:47.900 

so<00:04:46.980> that<00:04:47.160> at<00:04:47.280> this<00:04:47.370> point<00:04:47.550> you<00:04:47.699> will<00:04:47.820> have

00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:47.910 
so that at this point you will have

00:04:47.910 --> 00:04:53.990 
so that at this point you will have
three<00:04:48.449> displaced<00:04:49.260> on<00:04:49.820> the<00:04:50.820> Jason<00:04:51.180> sides

00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:54.000 

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:57.890 

now<00:04:54.570> we<00:04:54.630> can<00:04:55.050> switch<00:04:55.590> to<00:04:56.060> them<00:04:57.060> getting<00:04:57.450> one<00:04:57.870> in

00:04:57.890 --> 00:04:57.900 
now we can switch to them getting one in

00:04:57.900 --> 00:05:01.040 
now we can switch to them getting one in
place<00:04:58.340> usually<00:04:59.340> try<00:04:59.700> to<00:04:59.730> get<00:04:59.940> the<00:05:00.630> ones<00:05:00.810> in

00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:01.050 
place usually try to get the ones in

00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:02.750 
place usually try to get the ones in
between<00:05:01.140> the<00:05:01.410> two<00:05:01.530> centers<00:05:01.830> see<00:05:02.340> there's<00:05:02.670> the

00:05:02.750 --> 00:05:02.760 
between the two centers see there's the

00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:16.290 
between the two centers see there's the
middle<00:05:02.970> one<00:05:03.090> get<00:05:04.020> down<00:05:04.200> in<00:05:04.350> place<00:05:04.560> first

00:05:16.290 --> 00:05:16.300 

00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:18.540 

I<00:05:16.389> made<00:05:16.960> of<00:05:17.050> two<00:05:17.229> out<00:05:17.319> of<00:05:17.409> place<00:05:17.560> looks<00:05:18.250> sort<00:05:18.490> of

00:05:18.540 --> 00:05:18.550 
I made of two out of place looks sort of

00:05:18.550 --> 00:05:26.090 
I made of two out of place looks sort of
cool

00:05:26.090 --> 00:05:26.100 

00:05:26.100 --> 00:05:31.660 

just<00:05:26.700> bring<00:05:26.940> this<00:05:27.470> right<00:05:28.470> down<00:05:28.800> there

00:05:31.660 --> 00:05:31.670 

00:05:31.670 --> 00:05:34.680 

and<00:05:31.790> if<00:05:32.600> you<00:05:32.840> have<00:05:32.960> done<00:05:33.140> this<00:05:33.290> step<00:05:33.530> correctly

00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:34.690 
and if you have done this step correctly

00:05:34.690 --> 00:05:40.210 
and if you have done this step correctly
York<00:05:35.690> you<00:05:36.020> will<00:05:36.860> be<00:05:37.070> complete<00:05:38.620> this<00:05:39.620> is<00:05:39.800> a<00:05:39.830> very

00:05:40.210 --> 00:05:40.220 
York you will be complete this is a very

00:05:40.220 --> 00:05:43.900 
York you will be complete this is a very
confusing<00:05:40.820> step<00:05:42.190> try<00:05:43.190> watching<00:05:43.400> my<00:05:43.610> video

00:05:43.900 --> 00:05:43.910 
confusing step try watching my video

00:05:43.910 --> 00:05:46.510 
confusing step try watching my video
over<00:05:44.360> a<00:05:44.390> few<00:05:44.630> times<00:05:44.690> at<00:05:45.620> least<00:05:45.830> this<00:05:46.040> last<00:05:46.280> part

00:05:46.510 --> 00:05:46.520 
over a few times at least this last part

00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:49.420 
over a few times at least this last part
if<00:05:47.090> you<00:05:47.150> don't<00:05:47.360> understand<00:05:47.780> it<00:05:47.900> but<00:05:48.110> I'm<00:05:48.770> sure

00:05:49.420 --> 00:05:49.430 
if you don't understand it but I'm sure

00:05:49.430 --> 00:05:52.690 
if you don't understand it but I'm sure
you'll<00:05:49.670> get<00:05:49.850> it<00:05:49.970> eventually<00:05:50.060> and<00:05:51.520> you<00:05:52.520> should

00:05:52.690 --> 00:05:52.700 
you'll get it eventually and you should

00:05:52.700 --> 00:05:54.070 
you'll get it eventually and you should
be<00:05:52.730> able<00:05:52.820> to<00:05:53.000> solve<00:05:53.180> this<00:05:53.390> thing<00:05:53.450> with

00:05:54.070 --> 00:05:54.080 
be able to solve this thing with

00:05:54.080 --> 00:05:56.470 
be able to solve this thing with
practice<00:05:54.590> in<00:05:54.800> about<00:05:55.490> seven<00:05:56.000> minutes<00:05:56.210> my

00:05:56.470 --> 00:05:56.480 
practice in about seven minutes my

00:05:56.480 --> 00:05:59.320 
practice in about seven minutes my
record<00:05:56.870> was<00:05:57.160> five<00:05:58.160> minutes<00:05:58.310> and<00:05:58.580> 17<00:05:58.910> seconds

00:05:59.320 --> 00:05:59.330 
record was five minutes and 17 seconds

00:05:59.330 --> 00:06:01.930 
record was five minutes and 17 seconds
as<00:06:00.290> I<00:06:00.680> mentioned<00:06:00.710> one<00:06:01.100> of<00:06:01.190> my<00:06:01.250> earlier<00:06:01.580> videos

00:06:01.930 --> 00:06:01.940 
as I mentioned one of my earlier videos

00:06:01.940 --> 00:06:06.580 
as I mentioned one of my earlier videos
I<00:06:02.120> used<00:06:02.300> to<00:06:02.390> be<00:06:02.480> around<00:06:02.570> 13<00:06:03.230> minutes<00:06:03.790> but<00:06:05.590> it

00:06:06.580 --> 00:06:06.590 
I used to be around 13 minutes but it

00:06:06.590 --> 00:06:08.620 
I used to be around 13 minutes but it
gets<00:06:06.740> pretty<00:06:06.890> easy<00:06:07.160> if<00:06:07.340> for<00:06:07.550> a<00:06:07.580> while<00:06:07.730> the<00:06:08.420> five

00:06:08.620 --> 00:06:08.630 
gets pretty easy if for a while the five

00:06:08.630 --> 00:06:12.490 
gets pretty easy if for a while the five
by<00:06:08.780> five<00:06:10.030> actually<00:06:11.030> four<00:06:11.360> by<00:06:11.480> four<00:06:11.720> and<00:06:11.900> up<00:06:12.110> to

00:06:12.490 --> 00:06:12.500 
by five actually four by four and up to

00:06:12.500 --> 00:06:15.250 
by five actually four by four and up to
any<00:06:12.650> size<00:06:12.920> all<00:06:13.300> work<00:06:14.300> in<00:06:14.540> the<00:06:14.600> same<00:06:14.780> sort<00:06:15.230> of

00:06:15.250 --> 00:06:15.260 
any size all work in the same sort of

00:06:15.260 --> 00:06:17.680 
any size all work in the same sort of
method<00:06:15.440> i<00:06:15.800> can<00:06:16.340> even<00:06:16.550> solve<00:06:16.910> three<00:06:17.270> by<00:06:17.420> three

00:06:17.680 --> 00:06:17.690 
method i can even solve three by three

00:06:17.690 --> 00:06:20.920 
method i can even solve three by three
using<00:06:18.590> a<00:06:18.740> very<00:06:19.070> similar<00:06:19.400> method<00:06:19.910> the<00:06:20.660> only

00:06:20.920 --> 00:06:20.930 
using a very similar method the only

00:06:20.930 --> 00:06:22.720 
using a very similar method the only
problem<00:06:21.140> is<00:06:21.290> sometimes<00:06:21.620> when<00:06:22.370> you're<00:06:22.490> doing

00:06:22.720 --> 00:06:22.730 
problem is sometimes when you're doing

00:06:22.730 --> 00:06:25.390 
problem is sometimes when you're doing
the<00:06:22.850> edges<00:06:23.260> you<00:06:24.260> get<00:06:24.380> the<00:06:24.470> right<00:06:24.620> spot<00:06:24.950> it<00:06:25.220> just

00:06:25.390 --> 00:06:25.400 
the edges you get the right spot it just

00:06:25.400 --> 00:06:29.140 
the edges you get the right spot it just
flipped<00:06:25.910> um<00:06:26.980> I'll<00:06:27.980> make<00:06:28.310> a<00:06:28.340> video<00:06:28.550> for<00:06:28.700> the<00:06:28.940> 5

00:06:29.140 --> 00:06:29.150 
flipped um I'll make a video for the 5

00:06:29.150 --> 00:06:32.800 
flipped um I'll make a video for the 5
by<00:06:29.330> 5<00:06:29.590> which<00:06:30.590> solves<00:06:31.490> that<00:06:31.580> problem<00:06:31.660> if<00:06:32.660> you

00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:32.810 
by 5 which solves that problem if you

00:06:32.810 --> 00:06:36.730 
by 5 which solves that problem if you
have<00:06:32.990> a<00:06:33.100> virtual<00:06:34.100> cube<00:06:34.430> generator<00:06:35.000> um<00:06:35.740> you

00:06:36.730 --> 00:06:36.740 
have a virtual cube generator um you

00:06:36.740 --> 00:06:39.190 
have a virtual cube generator um you
know<00:06:36.800> you<00:06:36.890> can<00:06:37.100> do<00:06:37.220> any<00:06:37.700> size<00:06:38.390> up<00:06:38.600> to<00:06:38.630> the<00:06:38.810> 20<00:06:39.080> by

00:06:39.190 --> 00:06:39.200 
know you can do any size up to the 20 by

00:06:39.200 --> 00:06:40.820 
know you can do any size up to the 20 by
20

00:06:40.820 --> 00:06:40.830 
20

00:06:40.830 --> 00:06:44.100 
20
just<00:06:41.830> use<00:06:41.980> the<00:06:42.070> same<00:06:42.310> method<00:06:42.670> it<00:06:42.960> takes<00:06:43.960> a<00:06:44.050> long

00:06:44.100 --> 00:06:44.110 
just use the same method it takes a long

00:06:44.110 --> 00:06:45.930 
just use the same method it takes a long
time<00:06:44.170> maybe<00:06:44.770> i'll<00:06:44.950> post<00:06:45.130> a<00:06:45.220> tutorial<00:06:45.520> for<00:06:45.700> one

00:06:45.930 --> 00:06:45.940 
time maybe i'll post a tutorial for one

00:06:45.940 --> 00:06:48.540 
time maybe i'll post a tutorial for one
of<00:06:46.030> those<00:06:46.150> sometime
