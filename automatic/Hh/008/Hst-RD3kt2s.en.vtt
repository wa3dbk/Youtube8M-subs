00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:44.440 
to print it made a bunch of really cool
flower<00:01:42.230> pattern<00:01:42.680> strips<00:01:42.980> we<00:01:43.850> went<00:01:44.030> ahead<00:01:44.120> here

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:44.450 
flower pattern strips we went ahead here

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:47.830 
flower pattern strips we went ahead here
we<00:01:44.570> cut<00:01:44.780> out<00:01:44.900> some<00:01:45.350> of<00:01:45.650> the<00:01:45.860> patterns<00:01:46.280> now<00:01:47.060> the

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:47.840 
we cut out some of the patterns now the

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:49.690 
we cut out some of the patterns now the
whole<00:01:47.990> idea<00:01:48.020> is<00:01:48.530> we're<00:01:49.280> simply<00:01:49.580> gonna

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:49.700 
whole idea is we're simply gonna

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:51.850 
whole idea is we're simply gonna
decoupage<00:01:50.090> them<00:01:50.479> around<00:01:50.870> I've<00:01:51.530> gone<00:01:51.740> ahead

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:51.860 
decoupage them around I've gone ahead

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:54.760 
decoupage them around I've gone ahead
and<00:01:51.979> done<00:01:52.160> the<00:01:52.220> insides<00:01:52.760> and<00:01:53.090> the<00:01:53.360> outsides<00:01:53.810> so

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:54.770 
and done the insides and the outsides so

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:56.260 
and done the insides and the outsides so
if<00:01:55.010> you're<00:01:55.160> going<00:01:55.370> to<00:01:55.490> do<00:01:55.580> the<00:01:55.670> insides<00:01:56.060> I

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:56.270 
if you're going to do the insides I

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:58.210 
if you're going to do the insides I
would<00:01:56.390> actually<00:01:56.690> recommend<00:01:57.530> that<00:01:57.740> you<00:01:57.860> start

00:01:58.210 --> 00:01:58.220 
would actually recommend that you start

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:00.190 
would actually recommend that you start
with<00:01:58.340> the<00:01:58.640> insides<00:01:59.030> and<00:01:59.420> I'm<00:01:59.570> gonna<00:01:59.810> curl<00:02:00.080> up

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:00.200 
with the insides and I'm gonna curl up

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:02.140 
with the insides and I'm gonna curl up
the<00:02:00.350> edges<00:02:00.620> around<00:02:00.920> the<00:02:01.040> side<00:02:01.250> now<00:02:01.850> what<00:02:02.000> this

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:02.150
