00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:07.710
 well we are finally ready to 

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:09.630
 apply thinking there are many small 

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:11.640
 details that we have to cover before 

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:13.440
 install the painting what I have done 

00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:15.120
 now he was cleaning the car with a 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:17.250
 air gun to remove dust 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:19.260
 Bryant and I rode the entire car and 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:20.909
 we clean it with prette spray the last 

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:23.099
 What we should do is clean all 

00:00:20.909 --> 00:00:25.019
 car with a plush cloth rag is a 

00:00:23.099 --> 00:00:26.999
 somewhat sticky cloth that cleans 

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:28.980
 surface of lint and all the dust 

00:00:26.999 --> 00:00:31.409
 that the cloth has stayed on 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:32.910
 collects when it is painted with thought 

00:00:31.409 --> 00:00:34.829
 Any heavy paint is very 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:36.510
 important that you wear a respirator inside 

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:38.160
 from our painted booth we have a 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:40.470
 filter system but definitely 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:41.730
 will want to use a respirator finally in 

00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:43.590
 what refers to the gun of 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:46.020
 paint or sprayer we have a gun 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:48.150
 hb lp which means it is high 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:50.490
 volume and low pressure so with this 

00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:52.680
 gun will need about 20 psi 

00:00:50.490 --> 00:00:54.210
 to paint and that's it can also 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:56.490
 use a gun or sprayer 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:59.130
 conventional with he thought but in that 

00:00:56.490 --> 00:01:01.020
 case you will have to use between 30 and 40 psi 

00:00:59.130 --> 00:01:03.390
 but this will depend on the model of 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:05.339
 gun or sprayer that you use first 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:07.320
 Start by spraying a piece of cardboard or 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:09.299
 some test panel and you will want to perform 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:10.380
 all the settings on that piece of cardboard 

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:11.880
 or panel before 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:13.920
 with the body of the car that more 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:15.780
 we have to do well we are in a 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:17.640
 painted booth we are keeping 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:19.200
 all the dust out but we're in a 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:21.329
 warehouse and the floor where we 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:23.070
 we found it is a bit dirty so 

00:01:21.329 --> 00:01:25.170
 What we are going to do is pour water 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:27.000
 floor to prevent dust from starting 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:29.100
 float everywhere because the last 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.140
 What we need is for dust to fall on 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:33.600
 our painting work I'm going to start 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:36.030
 with that I have already advanced a little but I'm going 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:39.079
 to finish so we can continue 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:39.079
 I'm going to mix the paint 

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:09.450
 well now I can start painting 

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:10.920
 but there is a quick technique from which 

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:11.550
 I want to talk to you when you spray the 

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:13.620
 painting 

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:15.450
 start from the top down so 

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:17.549
 I'm going to paint the fender from here and 

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:19.230
 continue to the right I'll stop 

00:02:17.549 --> 00:02:21.090
 in the space in the panel and then 

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:22.680
 I will continue spraying paint but 

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:25.080
 moving towards the place where I started 

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:27.000
 superimpose the color with each pass to 

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:28.680
 that there are not many scratches left over 

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.450
 painting a bit so that of this 

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:32.670
 way the paint cover is 

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:33.959
 couple from the tip down also 

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:35.849
 will want to make sure that the zones 

00:02:33.959 --> 00:02:37.650
 difficult to reach be covered 

00:02:35.849 --> 00:02:39.450
 first so you do not have to bend over 

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:41.400
 over the car and finish with the painting 

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:43.140
 getting muddied on your clothes first I'm going to 

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:44.970
 paint the back of the panel the 

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:46.950
 header and also the back of 

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:49.760
 the fender and then I'll paint the 

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:49.760
 point down 

00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:18.010
 it's time to start 

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:34.420
 we're a little tight here in 

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:36.110
 our paint booth and 

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:38.300
 unfortunately when we were 

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:40.160
 painting the door was ruined a bit 

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:41.900
 our work when we open it for 

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:43.849
 paint the door beam as 

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:46.220
 our pants touched the side of the car 

00:03:43.849 --> 00:03:48.590
 but something that is great to think about is that 

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:51.230
 we can enter here sanding it like I did 

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:53.030
 with the grade 600 sandpaper to match it and 

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:54.830
 then give it a couple of hours before 

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:57.170
 repaint so I just 

00:03:54.830 --> 00:03:59.420
 finish with this adjustment and brian is going to 

00:03:57.170 --> 00:04:01.400
 ready paint or spray gun 

00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:03.350
 and very soon we are going to paint this other 

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:05.769
 time you will never notice that we had this 

00:04:03.350 --> 00:04:05.769
 problem
