 Thank you for turning on you have me 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:15.510
 a few questions posted in the 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:17.730
 comments and partly in the 

00:00:15.510 --> 00:00:19.380
 private messages and in this video 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:21.000
 just before Christmas , that's it 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:22.730
 last video before christmas yes me 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.350
 hope that nothing comes there Wednesday 

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:25.800
 I'm on the first Christmas holiday 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:28.109
 Do not be mistaken 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:29.789
 and yes i definitely want this one 

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:31.019
 video answer all questions i hope 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:32.790
 I have all have noted none of 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:34.590
 forget you if it shit there 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:36.510
 below comments then which oneself 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:39.059
 of course also answer and then 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:41.160
 you start shooting with the question 

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:42.809
 first question was what were you all 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:45.780
 First dish that I cooked alone 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:48.300
 I think it was relative at the time 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:49.980
 just pizza and have a few 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:52.530
 ingredients sound it was not alone at home 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:54.360
 and no money at all 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:56.579
 order or so then just with 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:58.440
 flour and salt and a bit of water 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:00.719
 stayed made pizza dough and a few 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:02.850
 ingredients on top of it also works quite well 

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:05.210
 works however of the 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:07.410
 Of course, perfection is still far away 

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:10.170
 Next question was then I have with the 

00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:12.900
 So I'm 25 now 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:16.350
 he did my internship in 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:18.630
 the kitchen was there i think i was 15 and 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:21.060
 I started cooking privately 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:23.670
 I think so with 13 flights but so with 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:26.670
 13 14 15 himself has started me well 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:28.560
 cooked slowly regularly then yes 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:31.530
 I still have a great question and that 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:32.909
 is who is my role model as cook it 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:35.579
 There are many German cuisine I like 

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:37.470
 and then, of course, to the melzer, though 

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:39.030
 of the presentation and the style of the 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:41.280
 cooking and especially one more 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:42.630
 presentation you are still jamie 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:46.020
 oliver of course the best known 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:47.579
 However, again from the 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:49.350
 staging how everything looks like 

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:51.810
 that may be my performance either way 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:53.220
 big role model and there I am someday 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:55.079
 Of course, too , it would be great if it were 

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:56.000
 would work still further 

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:58.590
 path 

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:00.540
 then a very good question what is 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:03.420
 the most conspicuous wallis ever cooked 

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:03.840
 I do not know what is not yet 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:06.570
 times 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:08.399
 21 there's a good question what was that 

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:10.530
 most elaborate thing I've ever cooked 

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:12.599
 pretty good question I do not know if it 

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:14.489
 but the most elaborate beats on everyone 

00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:16.950
 case for me in remembrance wait 

00:02:14.489 --> 00:02:19.349
 is namely difficult rally driver and 

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:21.060
 I had a hard time back then 

00:02:19.349 --> 00:02:22.260
 done since all the traction to find that 

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:22.769
 then combine everything well and to 

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:24.989
 do 

00:02:22.769 --> 00:02:26.549
 Nevertheless, the choice of meat was that 

00:02:24.989 --> 00:02:29.700
 At least that's what got me a bit then 

00:02:26.549 --> 00:02:31.530
 overwhelmed and therefore at least in 

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:33.569
 memory is rafa for me that 

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:34.080
 most elaborate thing that has at least cooked in 

00:02:33.569 --> 00:02:37.260
 memory 

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:39.660
 yes my biggest bad luck happen 

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:41.519
 remembered when baking button makes 

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:42.120
 I have so much fun everything is up to me 

00:02:41.519 --> 00:02:44.549
 not exactly 

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:46.380
 and yes that just happens to me 

00:02:44.549 --> 00:02:47.940
 best thing is somehow forgotten 

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:50.150
 too fat then returns vicious turn 

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:53.250
 or the form is everything apart 

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:55.590
 and at least with the vanillekipferl 

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:57.329
 ground had made as a video that must 

00:02:55.590 --> 00:03:00.810
 I, in fact, there is a soft two 

00:02:57.329 --> 00:03:02.310
 turn it because yes somehow it is 

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:03.840
 dough got rid of 

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:06.269
 the initial charge in the fridge 

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:07.739
 to let go a little bit and 

00:03:06.269 --> 00:03:10.139
 This was still a bit brave and 

00:03:07.739 --> 00:03:12.510
 yes I had to wait twice in the 

00:03:10.139 --> 00:03:15.720
 push oven and then but has too 

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:17.160
 So I started to cook 

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:18.660
 me, of course, in my family 

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:19.680
 mother with my grandma that has such a 

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:21.440
 started a little bit long 

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:25.769
 of course, pulled the trigger, the first buyer 

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:27.480
 and so it started sometime like me yes 

00:03:25.769 --> 00:03:30.090
 earlier a driver in the country more 

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:31.680
 go on alone yes I have found myself 

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:32.639
 I started to cook and me down and 

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:34.530
 again, platzeck's cabbage 

00:03:32.639 --> 00:03:35.700
 Eventually the internet came too 

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:37.889
 Search and I as well as a couple 

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:41.280
 could bring helpful tips to and 

00:03:37.889 --> 00:03:43.169
 That's how I started then 

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:45.359
 a really interesting question like him 

00:03:43.169 --> 00:03:46.709
 has to do with the cooking and me 

00:03:45.359 --> 00:03:48.720
 People often ask even now in the next 

00:03:46.709 --> 00:03:50.280
 video what the name is here on it 

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:53.130
 I know has now realize quite well 

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:55.980
 can this be the picture because 

00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:57.630
 my phone is used to cooking and yes me 

00:03:55.980 --> 00:04:00.389
 I broke my arm someday 

00:03:57.630 --> 00:04:02.660
 can a titan plate in and you have 

00:04:00.389 --> 00:04:05.130
 even statements long super cool and 

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:06.599
 yes as I said 30 times the dawn 

00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:07.140
 the last time it was through 

00:04:06.599 --> 00:04:09.660
 feast 

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:11.459
 there has a plate in and had to 

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:14.010
 therefore this wonderful evening again 

00:04:11.459 --> 00:04:15.510
 must be removed and yes that is so 

00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:19.290
 a small follower of my stupidity 

00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:22.290
 from the past maybe a few 

00:04:19.290 --> 00:04:24.600
 of you in charge of the again 3 2 1 

00:04:22.290 --> 00:04:25.980
 then maybe for some new 

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:27.120
 interesting what for me what 

00:04:25.980 --> 00:04:30.030
 use or the camera, the 

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:31.680
 used that was the fighting before 

00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:35.130
 brought more than one year had was a 

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:36.450
 Panasonic is the 99 say a whole 

00:04:35.130 --> 00:04:38.580
 normal hd camcorder with the me 

00:04:36.450 --> 00:04:39.900
 At the time I was recording for the camera 

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:41.970
 decided with me such an external 

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:43.470
 Microphone has something to plug in more 

00:04:41.970 --> 00:04:45.600
 how one can even here I see here am 

00:04:43.470 --> 00:04:46.890
 infect microphone is not of the best 

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:50.280
 But quality is also 

00:04:46.890 --> 00:04:52.740
 repaired and cut programs 

00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:54.810
 I use the reaction 11 

00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:57.030
 that's how I started it, too 

00:04:54.810 --> 00:04:58.560
 I learned from them and I keep that 

00:04:57.030 --> 00:05:00.860
 I also definitely care about it 

00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:03.030
 great fun to work with 

00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:04.710
 In any case, I wish you already 

00:05:03.030 --> 00:05:06.360

00:05:11.070 --> 00:05:14.160

00:05:12.540 --> 00:05:16.080

00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:18.479

00:05:27.630 --> 00:05:31.919
 components includes that fits great 

00:05:29.220 --> 00:05:33.690
