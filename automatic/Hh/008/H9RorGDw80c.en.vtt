soft<00:00:11.910> mats<00:00:12.210> would<00:00:12.510> basically<00:00:12.840> what<00:00:13.080> we're

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:13.200 
soft mats would basically what we're

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:15.169

00:00:15.169 --> 00:00:15.179 
going to do is through exercises we're

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:16.519 
going to do is through exercises we're
going<00:00:15.330> to<00:00:15.389> start<00:00:15.570> with<00:00:15.660> a<00:00:15.750> bicycle<00:00:16.170> crunch

00:00:16.519 --> 00:00:16.529 
going to start with a bicycle crunch

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:19.130 
going to start with a bicycle crunch
then<00:00:17.310> we're<00:00:17.580> going<00:00:17.670> to<00:00:17.730> do<00:00:17.910> a<00:00:18.240> plank<00:00:18.810> on<00:00:19.020> the

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:19.140 
then we're going to do a plank on the

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:21.380 
then we're going to do a plank on the
ball<00:00:19.380> we<00:00:20.039> were<00:00:20.160> just<00:00:20.190> moving<00:00:20.520> the<00:00:20.699> arms<00:00:21.029> codes

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:21.390 
ball we were just moving the arms codes

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:23.179 
ball we were just moving the arms codes
create<00:00:21.720> a<00:00:21.750> more<00:00:21.960> more<00:00:22.350> call<00:00:22.560> instability

00:00:23.179 --> 00:00:23.189 
create a more more call instability

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:25.070 
create a more more call instability
right<00:00:24.000> and<00:00:24.269> then<00:00:24.330> the<00:00:24.449> last<00:00:24.570> one<00:00:24.779> we're<00:00:24.990> going

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:25.080 
right and then the last one we're going

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:27.380 
right and then the last one we're going
to<00:00:25.170> do<00:00:25.289> is<00:00:25.529> just<00:00:26.039> crunches<00:00:26.519> on<00:00:26.699> the<00:00:26.789> ball<00:00:26.970> okay

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:27.390 
to do is just crunches on the ball okay

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:29.480 
to do is just crunches on the ball okay
so<00:00:27.449> what<00:00:27.720> you<00:00:27.900> do<00:00:28.109> is<00:00:28.349> your<00:00:28.859> bicycle<00:00:29.369> you're

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:29.490 
so what you do is your bicycle you're

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:32.119 
so what you do is your bicycle you're
going<00:00:29.609> to<00:00:29.670> do<00:00:29.760> 20<00:00:30.029> repetitions<00:00:30.529> okay<00:00:31.529> then

00:00:32.119 --> 00:00:32.129 
going to do 20 repetitions okay then

00:00:32.129 --> 00:00:34.250 
going to do 20 repetitions okay then
you're<00:00:32.220> going<00:00:32.340> to<00:00:32.400> go<00:00:32.460> into<00:00:32.910> your<00:00:33.449> ball<00:00:33.870> plank

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:34.260 
you're going to go into your ball plank

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:35.720 
you're going to go into your ball plank
we<00:00:34.440> moving<00:00:34.770> the<00:00:34.860> arms<00:00:35.130> forward<00:00:35.370> and<00:00:35.520> back

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:35.730 
we moving the arms forward and back

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:38.569 
we moving the arms forward and back
going<00:00:36.719> to<00:00:36.840> go<00:00:36.930> for<00:00:37.170> 20<00:00:37.500> of<00:00:37.590> them<00:00:37.739> right<00:00:38.370> and

00:00:38.569 --> 00:00:38.579 
going to go for 20 of them right and

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:39.530 
going to go for 20 of them right and
then<00:00:38.700> it<00:00:38.790> then<00:00:38.940> we're<00:00:39.059> going<00:00:39.149> to<00:00:39.239> do<00:00:39.329> 20

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:39.540 
then it then we're going to do 20

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:41.389 
then it then we're going to do 20
crunches<00:00:39.960> right<00:00:40.800> you're<00:00:40.950> going<00:00:41.040> to<00:00:41.129> do<00:00:41.219> three

00:00:41.389 --> 00:00:41.399 
crunches right you're going to do three

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:43.280 
crunches right you're going to do three
sets<00:00:41.730> but<00:00:42.329> what<00:00:42.480> we're<00:00:42.600> going<00:00:42.690> to<00:00:42.780> do<00:00:42.840> is<00:00:43.079> every

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.290 
sets but what we're going to do is every

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:44.510 
sets but what we're going to do is every
time<00:00:43.440> we're<00:00:43.590> going<00:00:43.680> to<00:00:43.739> drop<00:00:43.950> off<00:00:44.160> four

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520 
time we're going to drop off four

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:45.950 
time we're going to drop off four
repetitions<00:00:44.730> so<00:00:45.180> you<00:00:45.239> can<00:00:45.390> start<00:00:45.629> with<00:00:45.840> 20

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
repetitions so you can start with 20

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:47.930 
repetitions so you can start with 20
repetitions<00:00:46.379> of<00:00:46.800> each<00:00:46.950> we're<00:00:47.640> going<00:00:47.760> to<00:00:47.820> go

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
repetitions of each we're going to go

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:50.360 
repetitions of each we're going to go
down<00:00:48.120> to<00:00:48.149> 16<00:00:48.809> repetitions<00:00:49.350> of<00:00:49.469> each<00:00:49.590> and<00:00:49.860> then

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
down to 16 repetitions of each and then

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:52.130 
down to 16 repetitions of each and then
down<00:00:50.579> into<00:00:50.760> 12<00:00:51.090> repetitions<00:00:51.360> of<00:00:51.719> each<00:00:51.840> see

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
down into 12 repetitions of each see

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:54.020 
down into 12 repetitions of each see
this<00:00:52.289> system<00:00:52.920> athlete<00:00:53.219> is<00:00:53.340> dropping<00:00:53.789> off<00:00:53.910> the

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
this system athlete is dropping off the

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:55.670 
this system athlete is dropping off the
repetitions<00:00:54.570> and<00:00:54.750> what<00:00:55.350> we're<00:00:55.440> going<00:00:55.469> to<00:00:55.620> do

over time is that last set we do 12 you

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:00.619 
over time is that last set we do 12 you
want<00:00:58.949> to<00:00:59.010> add<00:00:59.160> more<00:00:59.579> repetition<00:01:00.090> so<00:01:00.239> that<00:01:00.390> you

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:00.629 
want to add more repetition so that you

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:03.560 
want to add more repetition so that you
will<00:01:00.780> start<00:01:01.140> like<00:01:01.320> said<00:01:01.789> 2016<00:01:02.789> 12<00:01:03.090> but<00:01:03.359> as<00:01:03.449> you

will start like said 2016 12 but as you

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:05.270 
will start like said 2016 12 but as you
get<00:01:03.660> stronger<00:01:03.930> through<00:01:04.379> the<00:01:04.530> weeks<00:01:04.710> you'll

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280

get stronger through the weeks you'll
add<00:01:05.489> more<00:01:05.729> repetitions<00:01:06.479> to<00:01:07.110> the<00:01:07.229> middle<00:01:07.530> and

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.049 
the last slow sets eventually you'll be

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:12.980 
the last slow sets eventually you'll be
doing<00:01:10.290> 20<00:01:10.740> 20<00:01:11.310> 20<00:01:11.610> all<00:01:12.119> right<00:01:12.270> three<00:01:12.630> rounds<00:01:12.930> of
