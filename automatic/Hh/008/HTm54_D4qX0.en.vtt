00:03:37.769 --> 00:03:39.289 
not my only complaint about the book was
the<00:03:38.040> writing<00:03:38.340> style<00:03:38.579> is<00:03:38.819> a<00:03:38.880> little<00:03:39.000> tough<00:03:39.269> to

00:03:39.289 --> 00:03:39.299 
the writing style is a little tough to

00:03:39.299 --> 00:03:42.830 
the writing style is a little tough to
get<00:03:39.569> used<00:03:39.780> to<00:03:40.069> the<00:03:41.069> sentence<00:03:41.400> structure<00:03:41.700> is<00:03:42.389> I

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:42.840 
get used to the sentence structure is I

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:45.890 
get used to the sentence structure is I
thought<00:03:43.260> a<00:03:43.319> little<00:03:43.709> a<00:03:43.980> little<00:03:44.730> unorthodox<00:03:45.239> and

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:45.900 
thought a little a little unorthodox and

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:47.750 
thought a little a little unorthodox and
sometimes<00:03:46.650> there<00:03:47.400> weren't<00:03:47.639> really

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:47.760 
sometimes there weren't really

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:49.729 
sometimes there weren't really
paragraphs<00:03:48.540> so<00:03:48.750> it<00:03:48.989> took<00:03:49.109> me<00:03:49.290> maybe<00:03:49.440> two

00:03:49.729 --> 00:03:49.739 
paragraphs so it took me maybe two

00:03:49.739 --> 00:03:51.949 
paragraphs so it took me maybe two
chapters<00:03:50.220> to<00:03:50.250> get<00:03:50.489> used<00:03:50.700> to<00:03:50.850> the<00:03:51.090> writing

00:03:51.949 --> 00:03:51.959 
chapters to get used to the writing

00:03:51.959 --> 00:03:53.479 
chapters to get used to the writing
style<00:03:52.170> but<00:03:52.470> it<00:03:52.560> was<00:03:52.650> still<00:03:52.859> difficult<00:03:53.010> to

00:03:53.479 --> 00:03:53.489 
style but it was still difficult to

00:03:53.489 --> 00:03:56.300 
style but it was still difficult to
follow<00:03:53.700> at<00:03:54.000> times<00:03:54.500> but<00:03:55.500> other<00:03:55.889> than<00:03:56.100> that<00:03:56.160> I

00:03:56.300 --> 00:03:56.310 
follow at times but other than that I

00:03:56.310 --> 00:03:58.490 
follow at times but other than that I
thought<00:03:56.639> it's<00:03:56.880> a<00:03:56.940> worthwhile<00:03:57.150> read<00:03:57.780> again<00:03:58.319> if

00:03:58.490 --> 00:03:58.500 
thought it's a worthwhile read again if

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:02.960 
thought it's a worthwhile read again if
you<00:03:59.340> know<00:03:59.459> it's<00:04:00.299> not<00:04:00.480> a<00:04:00.840> true<00:04:01.139> memoir<00:04:01.650> and<00:04:02.130> if

00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:02.970 
you know it's not a true memoir and if

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:05.150 
you know it's not a true memoir and if
you<00:04:03.480> know<00:04:03.630> you<00:04:04.049> might<00:04:04.260> find<00:04:04.470> it's<00:04:04.739> not<00:04:04.859> worth

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:05.160 
you know you might find it's not worth

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:08.059 
you know you might find it's not worth
it<00:04:05.370> to<00:04:05.549> read<00:04:05.760> if<00:04:06.269> you<00:04:06.510> you<00:04:06.959> know<00:04:07.079> if<00:04:07.349> you<00:04:07.769> really

00:04:08.059 --> 00:04:08.069 
it to read if you you know if you really

00:04:08.069 --> 00:04:10.290 
it to read if you you know if you really
want<00:04:08.280> to<00:04:08.370> read<00:04:08.489> a<00:04:08.519> memoir<00:04:09.060> and

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:10.300 
want to read a memoir and

00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:12.360 
want to read a memoir and
and<00:04:10.540> it's<00:04:10.870> not<00:04:11.020> based<00:04:11.200> on<00:04:11.440> truth<00:04:11.770> so<00:04:12.010> you<00:04:12.040> may

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:12.370 
and it's not based on truth so you may

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:13.980 
and it's not based on truth so you may
or<00:04:12.490> may<00:04:12.610> not<00:04:12.640> find<00:04:13.060> it<00:04:13.240> worth<00:04:13.450> to<00:04:13.660> read<00:04:13.840> if

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:13.990 
or may not find it worth to read if

00:04:13.990 --> 00:04:15.600 
or may not find it worth to read if
you're<00:04:14.080> looking<00:04:14.410> for<00:04:14.590> something<00:04:14.890> that's<00:04:15.100> fact

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:15.610 
you're looking for something that's fact

00:04:15.610 --> 00:04:19.500 
you're looking for something that's fact
but<00:04:16.200> overall<00:04:17.200> as<00:04:17.709> a<00:04:17.739> fiction<00:04:18.400> I<00:04:18.790> thought<00:04:19.330> it

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:19.510 
but overall as a fiction I thought it

00:04:19.510 --> 00:04:22.560 
but overall as a fiction I thought it
was<00:04:19.600> worth<00:04:19.780> it<00:04:20.050> thank<00:04:20.500> you
