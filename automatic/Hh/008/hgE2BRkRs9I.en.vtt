 punto net and this subclass by youtube a 

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:47.300
 next we are going to define a word 

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:50.809
 key that are mentioned throughout the class 

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:53.090
 and what is the chats is a very word 

00:00:50.809 --> 00:00:55.930
 interesting and that throughout my 

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:58.010
 career has had an impact 

00:00:55.930 --> 00:01:01.190
 very important 

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:02.750
 jobs are the skills in the battery or 

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:04.430
 how fast can I make a 

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:06.740
 Battery chats that the builders 

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:09.560
 below we will see are exercises 

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:13.420
 based on rhythmic reading which 

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:13.420
 we are going to fill them with doubles 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:41.240
 Y 

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:11.350
 once mastered in the axes 

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:13.960
 ready for everything that is coming we are going to 

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:18.220
 work what are the chop builders in 

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:21.520
 what is the rhythmic reading we work 

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:23.890
 two sections let's say two measures of 5 

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:25.570
 destruct grasping the accents in the 

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:26.860
 drummer of each of the figures of 

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:29.620
 the right way left right 

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:31.750
 left and then 2 bars filling 

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:33.550
 with doubles you can also do it 

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:36.370
 little bit more interesting taking a 

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:38.740
 ostinato on our feet basic by 

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:41.740
 example the numbers on eighth notes the 

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:44.830
 numbers in the hype and in the hyatt the 

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:47.290
 suns or a little more interesting what 

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:49.060
 they are sixteenths in the double bass drum and 

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:51.190
 do the exercise in the drummer 

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:53.590

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:55.570
 to develop quickly but also what 

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:58.600
 you can use in films you can 

00:02:55.570 --> 00:03:00.550
 use in one or you can use it 

00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:02.980
 in classes with hype and there are a lot of 

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:05.430
 more options so I hope you like them and
