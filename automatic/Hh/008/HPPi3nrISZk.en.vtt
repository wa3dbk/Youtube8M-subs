00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:36.860 
all right let's try a little more you
see<00:03:32.620> you<00:03:32.680> coming<00:03:32.950> out<00:03:33.010> the<00:03:33.130> bottom

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:36.870 

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:39.890 

smell<00:03:37.590> rainwater<00:03:38.270> should<00:03:39.270> not<00:03:39.390> just<00:03:39.660> pour

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:39.900

over<00:03:40.260> my<00:03:40.410> gutter<00:03:40.620> it<00:03:41.040> should<00:03:41.190> actually<00:03:41.310> go

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:41.550 
over my gutter it should actually go

00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:44.059 
over my gutter it should actually go
down<00:03:41.819> my<00:03:42.030> downspout<00:03:42.450> and<00:03:42.720> not<00:03:43.680> flood<00:03:43.950> my

basement and it really wasn't that hard
it<00:03:48.630> looked<00:03:48.810> worse<00:03:48.930> than<00:03:48.989> it<00:03:49.230> really<00:03:49.290> was<00:03:53.450> when

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:54.450 
it looked worse than it really was when

00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:55.610
