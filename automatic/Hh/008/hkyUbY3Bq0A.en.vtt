this<00:00:04.080> video<00:00:04.410> provides<00:00:04.800> a<00:00:04.920> quick<00:00:05.069> introduction

00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:05.490 
this video provides a quick introduction

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:09.020 
this video provides a quick introduction
to<00:00:05.730> some<00:00:05.819> playmaker<00:00:06.330> basics<00:00:07.790> here<00:00:08.790> we<00:00:08.910> have<00:00:09.000> a

00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:09.030 
to some playmaker basics here we have a

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:11.000 
to some playmaker basics here we have a
simple<00:00:09.330> test<00:00:09.540> scene<00:00:09.809> let's<00:00:10.530> say<00:00:10.680> we<00:00:10.770> want<00:00:10.950> to

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:11.010 
simple test scene let's say we want to

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:14.299 
simple test scene let's say we want to
control<00:00:11.280> this<00:00:11.430> cube<00:00:11.760> using<00:00:12.150> playmaker<00:00:13.160> we<00:00:14.160> can

00:00:14.299 --> 00:00:14.309 
control this cube using playmaker we can

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:16.640 
control this cube using playmaker we can
select<00:00:14.580> the<00:00:14.699> cube<00:00:14.940> and<00:00:15.209> add<00:00:15.959> a<00:00:15.990> state<00:00:16.289> machine

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:16.650 
select the cube and add a state machine

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:21.230 
select the cube and add a state machine
or<00:00:16.830> FSM<00:00:17.640> for<00:00:17.850> short<00:00:19.609> every<00:00:20.609> state<00:00:20.820> machine<00:00:21.119> has

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:21.240 
or FSM for short every state machine has

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:23.900 
or FSM for short every state machine has
a<00:00:21.269> start<00:00:21.630> state<00:00:22.220> that's<00:00:23.220> called<00:00:23.519> this<00:00:23.669> state

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:23.910 
a start state that's called this state

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:29.829 
a start state that's called this state
off<00:00:27.230> now<00:00:28.230> let's<00:00:28.439> add<00:00:28.589> an<00:00:28.710> action<00:00:28.890> to<00:00:29.160> the<00:00:29.279> state

00:00:29.829 --> 00:00:29.839 
off now let's add an action to the state

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:32.359 
off now let's add an action to the state
the<00:00:30.839> action<00:00:31.199> browser<00:00:31.410> shows<00:00:31.710> all<00:00:31.919> the<00:00:32.070> actions

00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:32.369 
the action browser shows all the actions

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:37.689 
the action browser shows all the actions
available<00:00:34.160> let's<00:00:35.160> select<00:00:35.640> a<00:00:36.000> material<00:00:36.719> action

00:00:37.689 --> 00:00:37.699 
available let's select a material action

00:00:37.699 --> 00:00:41.060 
available let's select a material action
set<00:00:38.699> material<00:00:38.850> color<00:00:39.500> and<00:00:40.500> add<00:00:40.680> it<00:00:40.859> to<00:00:40.949> the

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.070 
set material color and add it to the

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:48.250 
set material color and add it to the
state<00:00:43.489> now<00:00:44.489> we<00:00:44.550> can<00:00:44.760> set<00:00:44.969> the<00:00:45.059> color<00:00:45.410> to<00:00:46.410> red

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:48.260 
state now we can set the color to red

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:54.229 
state now we can set the color to red
now<00:00:49.260> if<00:00:49.320> we<00:00:49.469> press<00:00:49.649> play<00:00:52.850> we'll<00:00:53.850> see<00:00:54.000> that<00:00:54.120> the

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239 
now if we press play we'll see that the

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:59.650 
now if we press play we'll see that the
off<00:00:54.359> state<00:00:54.690> is<00:00:54.719> active<00:00:55.230> and<00:00:55.890> the<00:00:56.370> cube<00:00:56.579> is<00:00:56.699> red

00:00:59.650 --> 00:00:59.660 

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:03.169 

the<00:01:00.660> graph<00:01:00.870> view<00:01:01.140> here<00:01:01.500> is<00:01:01.940> where<00:01:02.940> you<00:01:03.030> add

00:01:03.169 --> 00:01:03.179 
the graph view here is where you add

00:01:03.179 --> 00:01:05.630 
the graph view here is where you add
states<00:01:03.570> and<00:01:03.750> transitions<00:01:04.460> so<00:01:05.460> let's

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
states and transitions so let's

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:07.700 
states and transitions so let's
right-click<00:01:05.850> on<00:01:06.150> the<00:01:06.270> canvas<00:01:06.660> and<00:01:07.290> add<00:01:07.470> a<00:01:07.500> new

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
right-click on the canvas and add a new

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:15.410 
right-click on the canvas and add a new
state<00:01:08.690> let's<00:01:09.690> call<00:01:09.930> this<00:01:10.080> state<00:01:10.580> on<00:01:14.360> now<00:01:15.360> we

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
state let's call this state on now we

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:16.820 
state let's call this state on now we
want<00:01:15.660> to<00:01:15.750> add<00:01:15.840> a<00:01:15.870> transition<00:01:16.290> from<00:01:16.560> the<00:01:16.710> off

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
want to add a transition from the off

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:20.570 
want to add a transition from the off
state<00:01:17.160> to<00:01:17.310> the<00:01:17.400> on<00:01:17.520> state<00:01:19.340> so<00:01:20.340> we<00:01:20.460> can

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
state to the on state so we can

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:22.430 
state to the on state so we can
right-click<00:01:20.760> the<00:01:21.120> off<00:01:21.210> state<00:01:21.510> and<00:01:22.290> add<00:01:22.410> a

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:22.440 
right-click the off state and add a

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:25.490 
right-click the off state and add a
transition<00:01:23.990> transitions<00:01:24.990> are<00:01:25.110> triggered<00:01:25.380> by

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
transition transitions are triggered by

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:27.650 
transition transitions are triggered by
events<00:01:25.920> if<00:01:26.760> we<00:01:26.880> right-click<00:01:27.150> on<00:01:27.510> the

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:27.660 
events if we right-click on the

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:29.810 
events if we right-click on the
transition<00:01:28.200> we<00:01:28.920> can<00:01:29.070> see<00:01:29.220> all<00:01:29.370> the<00:01:29.490> built-in

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
transition we can see all the built-in

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:34.970 
transition we can see all the built-in
events<00:01:31.100> let's<00:01:32.100> use<00:01:32.370> mouse<00:01:32.880> down<00:01:33.830> which<00:01:34.830> is

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:34.980 
events let's use mouse down which is

00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:37.150 
events let's use mouse down which is
sent<00:01:35.220> when<00:01:35.310> you<00:01:35.340> click<00:01:35.580> on<00:01:35.610> an<00:01:35.820> object<00:01:36.180> and

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:37.160 
sent when you click on an object and

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:41.690 
sent when you click on an object and
drag<00:01:38.160> a<00:01:38.220> link<00:01:38.490> to<00:01:38.580> the<00:01:38.700> on<00:01:38.790> state<00:01:40.400> on<00:01:41.400> the<00:01:41.580> on

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 
drag a link to the on state on the on

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:52.060 
drag a link to the on state on the on
state<00:01:43.730> set<00:01:44.730> the<00:01:44.820> material<00:01:45.210> color<00:01:45.450> to<00:01:46.070> green

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:52.070 

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:59.060 

now<00:01:53.070> if<00:01:53.219> you<00:01:53.310> press<00:01:53.490> play<00:01:57.560> and<00:01:58.560> you<00:01:58.710> click<00:01:58.920> on

00:01:59.060 --> 00:01:59.070 
now if you press play and you click on

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:02.600 
now if you press play and you click on
the<00:01:59.189> box<00:02:00.200> the<00:02:01.200> on-state<00:02:01.530> becomes<00:02:01.979> active<00:02:02.369> and

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:02.610 
the box the on-state becomes active and

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:06.740 
the box the on-state becomes active and
the<00:02:02.729> cube<00:02:02.969> is<00:02:03.090> green<00:02:04.969> to<00:02:05.969> finish<00:02:06.270> the<00:02:06.420> simple

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:06.750 
the cube is green to finish the simple

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:09.320 
the cube is green to finish the simple
example<00:02:07.229> let's<00:02:08.220> add<00:02:08.369> a<00:02:08.459> transition<00:02:08.970> back<00:02:09.119> to

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:09.330 
example let's add a transition back to

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:19.160 
example let's add a transition back to
the<00:02:09.420> off<00:02:09.539> state<00:02:09.810> on<00:02:10.019> mouse<00:02:10.410> up<00:02:17.750> now<00:02:18.750> let's<00:02:18.930> test

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:19.170 
the off state on mouse up now let's test

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:31.849 
the off state on mouse up now let's test
it<00:02:28.849> great
