BOA system is you have a dial at the top
to<00:00:32.800> tighten<00:00:33.250> the<00:00:33.310> boot<00:00:33.460> you<00:00:33.489> simply<00:00:33.940> turn<00:00:34.210> the

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:34.390 
to tighten the boot you simply turn the

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:38.010 
to tighten the boot you simply turn the
dial<00:00:35.160> with<00:00:36.160> this<00:00:36.340> system<00:00:36.550> obviously<00:00:37.329> you<00:00:37.899> know

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:38.020 
dial with this system obviously you know

to<00:00:52.180> get<00:00:52.300> out<00:00:52.449> of<00:00:52.600> the<00:00:52.690> boots<00:00:52.870> it's<00:00:53.079> extremely

00:00:53.759 --> 00:00:53.769 
to get out of the boots it's extremely

00:00:53.769 --> 00:00:56.849 
to get out of the boots it's extremely
simple<00:00:54.010> you<00:00:54.280> simply<00:00:54.550> pull<00:00:54.850> out<00:00:54.879> the<00:00:55.120> dial<00:00:55.859> pull

00:00:56.849 --> 00:00:56.859 
simple you simply pull out the dial pull

00:00:56.859 --> 00:00:58.619 
simple you simply pull out the dial pull
the<00:00:57.010> tongue<00:00:57.219> forward<00:00:57.609> and<00:00:58.120> you're<00:00:58.359> released

out of the boot definitely really nice
system<00:01:01.500> one<00:01:02.500> downfall<00:01:03.039> of<00:01:03.250> this<00:01:03.399> system

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:03.760 
system one downfall of this system

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:05.430 
system one downfall of this system
versus<00:01:04.030> others<00:01:04.300> is<00:01:04.540> that<00:01:04.720> you<00:01:04.839> don't<00:01:05.050> have<00:01:05.260> any

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:05.440 
versus others is that you don't have any

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:08.010 
versus others is that you don't have any
independent<00:01:06.060> adjustment<00:01:07.060> it's<00:01:07.390> give<00:01:07.750> me<00:01:07.840> the

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:08.020 
independent adjustment it's give me the

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:11.780 
independent adjustment it's give me the
same<00:01:08.230> tension<00:01:08.520> from<00:01:09.520> the<00:01:09.910> dial<00:01:10.420> to<00:01:11.290> the<00:01:11.320> toe

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790

these<00:01:56.179> boots<00:01:56.390> are<00:01:56.600> nice<00:01:56.810> because<00:01:57.020> they<00:01:57.590> have

00:01:58.080 --> 00:01:58.090 
these boots are nice because they have

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:43.010 
top of the mountain and you're looking

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:44.559 
top of the mountain and you're looking
to<00:02:43.069> do<00:02:43.190> some<00:02:43.370> trees<00:02:43.610> and<00:02:43.910> powder<00:02:44.060> stuff<00:02:44.390> like

00:02:44.559 --> 00:02:44.569 
to do some trees and powder stuff like

00:02:44.569 --> 00:02:46.599 
to do some trees and powder stuff like
that<00:02:44.780> you<00:02:45.290> can<00:02:45.440> really<00:02:45.650> crank<00:02:45.920> on<00:02:46.130> this<00:02:46.250> upper

00:02:46.599 --> 00:02:46.609 
that you can really crank on this upper

00:02:46.609 --> 00:02:48.940 
that you can really crank on this upper
portion<00:02:46.819> and<00:02:47.239> it<00:02:47.720> changes<00:02:48.290> the<00:02:48.440> Flex<00:02:48.680> of<00:02:48.859> the

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:48.950 
portion and it changes the Flex of the

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:51.280 
portion and it changes the Flex of the
boot<00:02:49.160> where<00:02:49.790> a<00:02:49.819> traditional<00:02:50.150> boot<00:02:50.750> you<00:02:51.260> know

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:51.290 
boot where a traditional boot you know

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:53.110 
boot where a traditional boot you know
might<00:02:51.709> have<00:02:51.739> had<00:02:51.950> a<00:02:51.980> flex<00:02:52.250> rate<00:02:52.430> of<00:02:52.549> five<00:02:52.790> under

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:53.120 
might have had a flex rate of five under

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:54.970 
might have had a flex rate of five under
one<00:02:53.269> to<00:02:53.359> ten<00:02:53.540> scale<00:02:53.720> boots<00:02:54.470> like<00:02:54.620> this<00:02:54.799> are

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:54.980 
one to ten scale boots like this are

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:56.319 
one to ten scale boots like this are
going<00:02:55.130> to<00:02:55.190> be<00:02:55.310> more<00:02:55.489> of<00:02:55.609> like<00:02:55.639> a<00:02:55.760> four<00:02:56.060> to<00:02:56.209> A<00:02:56.239> six

00:02:56.319 --> 00:02:56.329 
going to be more of like a four to A six

00:02:56.329 --> 00:02:58.629 
going to be more of like a four to A six
so<00:02:57.230> they're<00:02:57.410> a<00:02:57.769> little<00:02:57.889> bit<00:02:58.040> more<00:02:58.220> versatile

00:02:58.629 --> 00:02:58.639 
so they're a little bit more versatile

00:02:58.639 --> 00:03:01.750 
so they're a little bit more versatile

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:02.930 
again a lot of people worry about the

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:05.500 
again a lot of people worry about the

overall weight of the boot robert was
traditionally<00:03:58.430> used<00:03:58.489> in<00:03:58.790> the<00:03:58.910> past<00:03:59.180> but<00:03:59.660> a

00:03:59.680 --> 00:03:59.690 
traditionally used in the past but a

materials on the market now obviously

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:04.960 
materials on the market now obviously
it's<00:04:03.709> durability<00:04:04.129> in<00:04:04.459> its<00:04:04.580> grip<00:04:04.819> is<00:04:04.940> really

00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:04.970 
it's durability in its grip is really

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:06.970 
it's durability in its grip is really
good<00:04:05.390> so<00:04:05.840> what<00:04:05.930> companies<00:04:06.290> have<00:04:06.440> done<00:04:06.620> is<00:04:06.830> they

file on material which you'll see as a

00:04:16.639 --> 00:04:18.280 
file on material which you'll see as a
