 hello to all tankers with you, you rude me 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:20.460
 today i want to make such a short 

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:22.230
 video appeal to developers hope 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:23.910
 at least one of them sees this well 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:26.460
 or someone from those who see who 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:28.260
 knows the developers they throw it is not 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:30.090
 I know even the actual problem 

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:32.669
 I don't even know how her 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:34.950
 correctly describe but this problem is already on 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:37.050
 over the last few patches 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:39.180
 may not just explain to me 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:41.040
 make it not so well or 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:43.980
 try to fix it please 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:46.440
 because i buy a premium account yes 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:48.930
 and how glad I am to see the premium hangar 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:50.489
 always that is i like it like i 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:52.320
 I love him that is, I do not like to put 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:53.789
 what kind of fashion for special hangars me 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:56.129
 like it here is my premium hangar 

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:58.469
 standard without any problems there 

00:00:56.129 --> 00:01:00.149
 I like only the standard here, but I 

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:02.879
 I don't see it because I'm always buying 

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:04.229
 straight and i want to see normal 

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:05.970
 premium hangar they are such 

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:08.280
 black bullshit which happens to me 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:11.460
 sorry of course for saying yes garbage in 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:14.460
 principle, but it is not a mate, and just like that 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:16.470
 as if the expression does not suit me 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:19.200
 absolutely what i see here is this black 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:21.000
 nonsense and this is no longer know for 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:24.030
 two or three packs several times a 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.680
 I have a day and I do not know how 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:27.360
 so play because i like it 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:30.540
 of course yes the gameplay is not 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:33.030
 interferes but hangar black thats not good 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:35.400
 at least there are mods at least there are no mods I checked 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:38.670
 all the same this theme happens 

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:39.060
 15-20 battles spent went to the black hangar 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:41.400
 hangar 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:42.869
 of course then went into battle and after the battle 

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:44.159
 everything is already fine 

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:45.720
 perezashel in the tank as well as though 

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:47.310
 copes but still it doesn't 

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:49.890

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:51.990
