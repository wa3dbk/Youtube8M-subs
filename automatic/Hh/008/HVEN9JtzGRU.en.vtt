00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:11.290 
the fourth round I think when Deonte

landed<00:02:11.709> a<00:02:11.770> big<00:02:12.069> left<00:02:12.430> hook<00:02:12.790> I<00:02:13.090> think<00:02:13.540> it<00:02:13.630> was

the first significant left hook he'd

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:18.059 
the first significant left hook he'd
landed<00:02:16.000> in<00:02:16.150> the<00:02:16.270> fight<00:02:16.510> which<00:02:16.810> dropped<00:02:17.260> Molina

00:03:46.710 --> 00:03:46.720 
lot of his power but I thought he was

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:49.319

00:03:49.319 --> 00:03:49.329 
basically a power puncher with a shaky

00:03:49.329 --> 00:03:52.020 
basically a power puncher with a shaky
twitching<00:03:50.019> and<00:03:50.260> questionable<00:03:51.250> technique<00:03:51.760> and

twitching and questionable technique and

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:54.150 
twitching and questionable technique and
he's<00:03:52.720> proved<00:03:53.019> me<00:03:53.230> wrong<00:03:53.380> on<00:03:53.650> that

changed<00:04:14.760> my<00:04:15.030> opinion<00:04:15.720> about<00:04:15.870> him<00:04:16.440> was<00:04:17.100> I<00:04:17.310> was

00:04:17.510 --> 00:04:17.520 
changed my opinion about him was I was

00:04:17.520 --> 00:04:20.000 
changed my opinion about him was I was
convinced<00:04:18.300> that<00:04:18.360> sooner<00:04:18.960> or<00:04:18.990> later<00:04:19.110> remains

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:20.010 
convinced that sooner or later remains

00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:21.800 
convinced that sooner or later remains
the<00:04:20.310> burn<00:04:20.550> was<00:04:20.880> going<00:04:21.120> to<00:04:21.210> catch<00:04:21.450> him<00:04:21.690> with

00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:21.810 
the burn was going to catch him with

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:24.320 
the burn was going to catch him with
something<00:04:22.320> big<00:04:22.590> and<00:04:22.860> I<00:04:23.400> didn't<00:04:23.790> think<00:04:23.970> the<00:04:24.180> odd

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:24.330 
something big and I didn't think the odd

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:26.720 
something big and I didn't think the odd
day<00:04:24.600> would<00:04:24.810> be<00:04:24.960> able<00:04:25.260> to<00:04:25.350> survive<00:04:25.740> that<00:04:25.800> but

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:26.730 
day would be able to survive that but

00:04:26.730 --> 00:04:30.280 
day would be able to survive that but
instead<00:04:26.880> what<00:04:27.480> I<00:04:27.510> saw<00:04:27.930> much<00:04:28.500> to<00:04:28.740> my<00:04:28.920> surprise

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:30.290 
instead what I saw much to my surprise

00:04:30.290 --> 00:04:34.070 
instead what I saw much to my surprise
was<00:04:31.290> a<00:04:31.320> Wilder<00:04:32.040> who<00:04:32.220> was<00:04:32.430> disciplined<00:04:33.180> who<00:04:33.870> was

00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:34.080 
was a Wilder who was disciplined who was

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:37.310 
was a Wilder who was disciplined who was
using<00:04:34.350> a<00:04:34.620> good<00:04:34.830> jab<00:04:35.390> fighting<00:04:36.390> intelligently

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:37.320 
using a good jab fighting intelligently

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:40.310 
using a good jab fighting intelligently
his<00:04:37.950> technique<00:04:38.550> seemed<00:04:38.940> improved<00:04:39.480> matches

00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:40.320 
his technique seemed improved matches

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:43.580 
his technique seemed improved matches
very<00:04:41.130> good<00:04:41.430> athleticism<00:04:42.030> and<00:04:42.690> then<00:04:43.380> there's

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:43.590 
very good athleticism and then there's

00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:46.460 
very good athleticism and then there's
always<00:04:43.830> that<00:04:44.280> power<00:04:44.700> factor<00:04:45.420> with<00:04:45.600> Deonte<00:04:46.230> and

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:46.470 
always that power factor with Deonte and

00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:49.310 
always that power factor with Deonte and
I<00:04:47.340> thought<00:04:47.820> he<00:04:48.090> made<00:04:48.300> a<00:04:48.330> fine<00:04:48.720> account<00:04:49.200> of

00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:49.320 
I thought he made a fine account of

00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:52.070 
I thought he made a fine account of
himself<00:04:49.770> against<00:04:50.250> the<00:04:50.430> verb<00:04:50.700> the<00:04:51.330> problem<00:04:51.900> now

00:04:52.070 --> 00:04:52.080 
himself against the verb the problem now

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:54.860 
himself against the verb the problem now
becomes<00:04:52.590> for<00:04:52.860> Deontay<00:04:53.400> Wilder<00:04:53.430> and<00:04:54.300> I'm<00:04:54.600> not

00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:54.870 
becomes for Deontay Wilder and I'm not

00:04:54.870 --> 00:04:56.840 
becomes for Deontay Wilder and I'm not
going<00:04:55.080> to<00:04:55.140> be<00:04:55.290> too<00:04:55.500> critical<00:04:55.830> of<00:04:56.160> his<00:04:56.340> team<00:04:56.640> in

00:04:56.840 --> 00:04:56.850 
going to be too critical of his team in

00:04:56.850 --> 00:04:59.300 
going to be too critical of his team in
the<00:04:56.880> sense<00:04:57.240> that<00:04:57.390> he's<00:04:58.320> undefeated

00:04:59.300 --> 00:04:59.310 
the sense that he's undefeated

00:04:59.310 --> 00:05:00.590 
the sense that he's undefeated
and<00:04:59.460> they've<00:04:59.700> guided<00:04:59.940> him<00:05:00.330> to<00:05:00.480> this

00:05:00.590 --> 00:05:00.600 
and they've guided him to this

00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:03.590 
and they've guided him to this
undefeated<00:05:01.350> record<00:05:01.620> as<00:05:02.040> a<00:05:02.240> very<00:05:03.240> rare

00:05:03.590 --> 00:05:03.600 
undefeated record as a very rare

00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:06.260 
undefeated record as a very rare
commodity<00:05:04.350> in<00:05:04.380> this<00:05:04.680> stage<00:05:04.950> day<00:05:05.400> in<00:05:05.550> age<00:05:05.730> as<00:05:06.000> an

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:06.270 
commodity in this stage day in age as an

00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:09.980 
commodity in this stage day in age as an
American<00:05:06.930> heavyweight<00:05:07.490> champion<00:05:08.490> and<00:05:08.990> they

00:05:09.980 --> 00:05:09.990 
American heavyweight champion and they

00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:12.020 
American heavyweight champion and they
got<00:05:10.230> him<00:05:10.410> there<00:05:10.650> but<00:05:11.190> I<00:05:11.220> think<00:05:11.520> the<00:05:11.640> problem

00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:12.030 
got him there but I think the problem

00:05:12.030 --> 00:05:14.890 
got him there but I think the problem
for<00:05:12.060> Wilder<00:05:12.690> now<00:05:12.900> is<00:05:13.250> with<00:05:14.250> the<00:05:14.430> lack<00:05:14.700> of

00:05:14.890 --> 00:05:14.900 
for Wilder now is with the lack of

00:05:14.900 --> 00:05:17.390 
for Wilder now is with the lack of
appropriate<00:05:15.900> preparation<00:05:16.890> the<00:05:17.130> type<00:05:17.370> of

00:05:17.390 --> 00:05:17.400 
appropriate preparation the type of

00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:19.700 
appropriate preparation the type of
fights<00:05:17.910> that<00:05:18.300> helped<00:05:18.540> build<00:05:18.870> him<00:05:19.260> and<00:05:19.470> bring

00:05:19.700 --> 00:05:19.710 
fights that helped build him and bring

00:05:19.710 --> 00:05:21.290 
fights that helped build him and bring
him<00:05:19.860> to<00:05:19.890> the<00:05:20.100> next<00:05:20.280> level<00:05:20.880> and<00:05:21.000> gain

00:05:21.290 --> 00:05:21.300 
him to the next level and gain

00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:24.410 
him to the next level and gain
experience<00:05:22.140> points<00:05:22.550> he<00:05:23.550> didn't<00:05:23.880> have<00:05:24.090> those

00:05:24.410 --> 00:05:24.420 
experience points he didn't have those

00:05:24.420 --> 00:05:27.890 
experience points he didn't have those
type<00:05:24.810> of<00:05:24.840> fights<00:05:25.460> Malina<00:05:26.460> this<00:05:26.940> past<00:05:27.240> weekend

00:05:27.890 --> 00:05:27.900 
type of fights Malina this past weekend

00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:30.230 
type of fights Malina this past weekend
represented<00:05:28.890> one<00:05:29.100> of<00:05:29.220> those<00:05:29.400> type<00:05:29.730> of<00:05:29.760> fights

00:05:30.230 --> 00:05:30.240

represented one of those type of fights
that<00:05:30.510> he<00:05:30.690> really<00:05:31.200> needed<00:05:31.440> to<00:05:31.590> have<00:05:32.780> before<00:05:33.780> he

00:05:34.430 --> 00:05:34.440 
that he really needed to have before he

00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:36.800 
that he really needed to have before he
was<00:05:34.590> in<00:05:34.770> the<00:05:34.890> driver's<00:05:35.040> seat<00:05:35.490> as<00:05:35.820> an<00:05:36.210> American

00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:36.810 
was in the driver's seat as an American

was in the driver's seat as an American
Heavyweight<00:05:37.380> Champion<00:05:38.160> so<00:05:38.910> even<00:05:39.210> though

00:05:39.530 --> 00:05:39.540 
Heavyweight Champion so even though

00:05:39.540 --> 00:05:42.500 
Heavyweight Champion so even though
Wilders<00:05:40.230> team<00:05:40.590> guided<00:05:41.190> him<00:05:41.370> to<00:05:41.400> the<00:05:41.580> title<00:05:42.300> in

Wilders team guided him to the title in

00:05:42.510 --> 00:05:45.080 
Wilders team guided him to the title in
a<00:05:43.200> sense<00:05:43.530> I<00:05:43.710> think<00:05:44.040> they<00:05:44.190> did<00:05:44.460> him<00:05:44.670> a<00:05:44.700> great

00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:45.090 
a sense I think they did him a great

00:05:45.090 --> 00:05:47.900 
a sense I think they did him a great
disservice<00:05:45.390> because<00:05:46.350> now<00:05:46.590> as<00:05:46.830> the<00:05:47.040> champion<00:05:47.670> I

00:05:47.900 --> 00:05:47.910 
disservice because now as the champion I

00:05:47.910 --> 00:05:50.570 
disservice because now as the champion I
don't<00:05:48.600> think<00:05:48.870> he<00:05:49.050> has<00:05:49.260> the<00:05:49.530> experience<00:05:49.710> he

00:05:50.570 --> 00:05:50.580 
don't think he has the experience he

00:05:50.580 --> 00:05:53.750 
don't think he has the experience he
needs<00:05:50.910> to<00:05:51.870> be<00:05:52.050> fully<00:05:52.380> prepared<00:05:52.710> for<00:05:53.280> these<00:05:53.370> big

00:05:53.750 --> 00:05:53.760

fight<00:07:10.320> him<00:07:10.470> one<00:07:10.710> punch<00:07:11.070> and<00:07:11.370> even<00:07:11.639> against

he'd<00:07:17.160> certainly<00:07:17.759> have<00:07:17.940> a<00:07:17.970> chance<00:07:18.389> because

00:07:18.620 --> 00:07:18.630 
he'd certainly have a chance because

he'd certainly have a chance because
he's<00:07:19.050> got<00:07:19.320> that<00:07:19.590> power<00:07:19.889> and<00:07:20.430> Vlad<00:07:21.240> himself<00:07:21.840> I

00:07:22.010 --> 00:07:22.020 
he's got that power and Vlad himself I

00:07:22.020 --> 00:07:23.510 
he's got that power and Vlad himself I
think<00:07:22.289> is<00:07:22.440> started<00:07:22.860> to<00:07:22.949> show<00:07:23.130> his<00:07:23.310> age<00:07:23.490> a

think is started to show his age a

00:07:23.520 --> 00:07:26.480

little bit the last year or two but be

little bit the last year or two but be
that<00:07:26.729> as<00:07:26.760> it<00:07:26.970> may
