00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:31.170 
is you could actually link a couple of

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:33.319 
is you could actually link a couple of
different<00:00:31.590> drums<00:00:31.830> together<00:00:32.309> for<00:00:32.880> instance<00:00:33.210> if

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:35.790 
I want to make this kick drum really

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:38.479 
I want to make this kick drum really
uniquely<00:00:36.510> customized<00:00:37.230> and<00:00:37.950> not<00:00:38.160> sound<00:00:38.430> like

00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:38.489 
uniquely customized and not sound like

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:40.940 
uniquely customized and not sound like
anybody<00:00:38.790> else's<00:00:39.360> I<00:00:39.600> can<00:00:40.200> do<00:00:40.320> that<00:00:40.500> a<00:00:40.530> couple<00:00:40.680> of

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:40.950 
anybody else's I can do that a couple of

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:44.209 
anybody else's I can do that a couple of
different<00:00:41.280> ways<00:00:41.809> now<00:00:42.809> watch<00:00:43.050> this<00:00:43.320> of<00:00:44.010> course

I've got it loaded and we've listened to

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:57.290 
I've got it loaded and we've listened to
our<00:00:46.020> kit<00:00:46.320> already<00:00:54.050> and<00:00:55.820> what<00:00:56.820> if<00:00:56.940> I<00:00:57.000> want<00:00:57.239> to

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399 
make that kick really really heavy I'm

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:03.950 
make that kick really really heavy I'm
going<00:01:02.550> to<00:01:02.609> go<00:01:02.670> up<00:01:02.760> to<00:01:02.820> the<00:01:02.910> percussion<00:01:03.480> slot

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
going to go up to the percussion slot

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:07.429 
going to go up to the percussion slot
here<00:01:04.409> and<00:01:04.799> double<00:01:05.129> click<00:01:05.280> on<00:01:05.519> it<00:01:06.110> then<00:01:07.110> we<00:01:07.320> go

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:07.439 
here and double click on it then we go

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:09.830 
here and double click on it then we go
to<00:01:07.500> the<00:01:07.590> top<00:01:07.830> where<00:01:08.220> it<00:01:08.280> says<00:01:08.400> type<00:01:08.880> it

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
to the top where it says type it

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:11.240 
to the top where it says type it
automatically<00:01:10.530> is<00:01:10.680> going<00:01:10.950> to<00:01:11.040> load

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
automatically is going to load

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:12.890 
automatically is going to load
percussion<00:01:11.939> since<00:01:12.240> that's<00:01:12.390> a<00:01:12.450> percussion

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
percussion since that's a percussion

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:16.969 
percussion since that's a percussion
slot<00:01:13.640> let's<00:01:14.640> change<00:01:14.909> that<00:01:15.150> and<00:01:15.650> let's<00:01:16.650> load

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:16.979 
slot let's change that and let's load

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:21.740 
slot let's change that and let's load
kick<00:01:18.500> and<00:01:19.500> I'm<00:01:19.590> going<00:01:19.770> to<00:01:19.830> take<00:01:20.070> a<00:01:20.540> sample<00:01:21.540> from

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
kick and I'm going to take a sample from

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:25.310 
kick and I'm going to take a sample from
the<00:01:22.439> drum<00:01:22.710> machine<00:01:23.070> from<00:01:23.250> the<00:01:23.369> 808<00:01:23.790> and<00:01:24.689> put

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 
the drum machine from the 808 and put

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:28.819 
the drum machine from the 808 and put
that<00:01:25.470> here<00:01:26.180> now<00:01:27.180> of<00:01:27.299> course<00:01:27.509> it's<00:01:28.439> up<00:01:28.650> here

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:28.829 
that here now of course it's up here

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:33.620 
that here now of course it's up here
right<00:01:28.979> now<00:01:30.710> but<00:01:31.710> I'm<00:01:31.860> going<00:01:31.979> to<00:01:32.070> link<00:01:32.280> them<00:01:32.630> so

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
right now but I'm going to link them so

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:35.960 
right now but I'm going to link them so
how<00:01:33.780> do<00:01:33.840> we<00:01:33.930> do<00:01:34.170> that<00:01:34.229> so<00:01:34.590> it<00:01:34.770> will<00:01:34.920> play<00:01:35.280> every

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970 
how do we do that so it will play every

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:39.260 
how do we do that so it will play every
time<00:01:36.180> to<00:01:36.600> kick<00:01:36.780> drum<00:01:36.990> plays<00:01:37.909> go<00:01:38.909> to<00:01:38.970> the<00:01:39.090> kick

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270 
time to kick drum plays go to the kick

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:42.469 
time to kick drum plays go to the kick
drum<00:01:39.320> select<00:01:40.320> it<00:01:40.520> go<00:01:41.520> over<00:01:41.670> to<00:01:41.790> the<00:01:41.909> left<00:01:42.119> here

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:42.479 
drum select it go over to the left here

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:47.539 
drum select it go over to the left here
so<00:01:43.470> it<00:01:43.590> says<00:01:43.740> link<00:01:44.899> okay<00:01:45.899> then<00:01:46.200> drag<00:01:46.560> it<00:01:46.590> up<00:01:46.829> to

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:47.549 
so it says link okay then drag it up to

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:50.320 
so it says link okay then drag it up to
here

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:50.330 

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:54.670 

now<00:01:51.200> every<00:01:51.590> time<00:01:52.270> we<00:01:53.270> trigger<00:01:53.630> the<00:01:53.960> kick<00:01:54.290> we're

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:54.680 
now every time we trigger the kick we're

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:56.430 
now every time we trigger the kick we're
also<00:01:54.860> going<00:01:55.070> to<00:01:55.160> get<00:01:55.310> the<00:01:55.460> 808<00:01:55.970> kick

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:56.440 
also going to get the 808 kick

00:01:56.440 --> 00:02:07.360 
also going to get the 808 kick
simultaneously<00:01:57.550> Laird<00:02:04.600> not<00:02:05.600> cool<00:02:06.250> we<00:02:07.250> also

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:07.370 
simultaneously Laird not cool we also

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:09.370 
simultaneously Laird not cool we also
have<00:02:07.610> the<00:02:07.700> ability<00:02:07.790> of<00:02:08.119> course<00:02:08.479> to<00:02:08.720> mix

00:02:09.370 --> 00:02:09.380 
have the ability of course to mix

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:11.770 
have the ability of course to mix
between<00:02:09.680> the<00:02:10.070> two<00:02:10.390> using<00:02:11.390> this<00:02:11.510> knob<00:02:11.750> here

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:11.780 
between the two using this knob here

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:13.510 
between the two using this knob here
let's<00:02:12.440> say<00:02:12.530> we<00:02:12.590> want<00:02:12.800> this<00:02:12.860> a<00:02:12.920> little<00:02:13.220> lower

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:13.520 
let's say we want this a little lower

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:17.860 
let's say we want this a little lower
and<00:02:15.130> then<00:02:16.130> as<00:02:16.370> I<00:02:16.640> showed<00:02:16.880> you<00:02:16.910> before<00:02:17.120> we<00:02:17.720> can

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:17.870 
and then as I showed you before we can

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:23.100 
and then as I showed you before we can
change<00:02:18.520> the<00:02:19.520> pitch<00:02:20.440> so<00:02:21.440> let's<00:02:21.680> go<00:02:21.860> over<00:02:22.190> and

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:23.110 
change the pitch so let's go over and

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:27.400 
change the pitch so let's go over and
while<00:02:24.110> it's<00:02:24.320> playing<00:02:24.650> let's<00:02:25.400> adjust<00:02:25.820> the<00:02:26.410> some

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:27.410 
while it's playing let's adjust the some

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:28.750 
while it's playing let's adjust the some
of<00:02:27.500> the<00:02:27.560> features<00:02:27.680> we've<00:02:27.980> got<00:02:28.130> here<00:02:28.340> such<00:02:28.640> as

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:28.760 
of the features we've got here such as

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:48.720 
of the features we've got here such as
the<00:02:28.880> frequency<00:02:29.060> the<00:02:30.020> damping<00:02:30.500> and<00:02:31.060> the<00:02:32.060> tuning

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:48.730 

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:53.250 

okay<00:02:49.730> so<00:02:50.390> what<00:02:50.540> do<00:02:50.630> we<00:02:50.690> just<00:02:50.959> do<00:02:51.580> we<00:02:52.580> layered<00:02:52.880> a

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:53.260 
okay so what do we just do we layered a

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:56.740 
okay so what do we just do we layered a
drum<00:02:54.260> machine<00:02:54.350> kick<00:02:55.310> with<00:02:55.850> a<00:02:55.880> real<00:02:56.239> acoustic

00:02:56.740 --> 00:02:56.750 
drum machine kick with a real acoustic

00:02:56.750 --> 00:03:01.600 
drum machine kick with a real acoustic
kit<00:02:57.280> kick<00:02:58.390> we've<00:02:59.390> linked<00:02:59.780> them<00:02:59.900> together<00:03:00.610> we

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:01.610 
kit kick we've linked them together we

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:05.610 
kit kick we've linked them together we
controlled<00:03:02.150> the<00:03:02.510> amount<00:03:03.410> of<00:03:03.530> damp<00:03:04.180> tuning

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:05.620 
controlled the amount of damp tuning

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:09.640 
controlled the amount of damp tuning
dynamics<00:03:06.620> and<00:03:06.830> mix<00:03:08.110> now<00:03:09.110> let's<00:03:09.410> say

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:09.650 
dynamics and mix now let's say

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:11.590
