00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.440
 it is considered that in extreme 

00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:06.629
 situations traumatic pistol is the 

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:09.120
 reliable security guarantee 

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:11.550
 however lately we have increasingly 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:13.799
 see the opposite using travmatiku 

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:16.049
 too many citizens fall if not 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:18.330
 under the counter strike then on the bench 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:21.449
 defendants what rules need to be followed 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:24.410
 to defend yourself not to go behind bars about 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:24.410
 this yuri kormushin 

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:32.850
 once in the arsenal of funds 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:35.370
 self appeared traumatic 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:36.600
 the gun he immediately called ambiguous 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:38.910
 social reaction 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:41.070
 as this weapon began to be used not 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:41.940
 only good citizens in order 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:44.280
 self defense 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:46.440
 but street hooligans are amateurs 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:49.470
 conflicts and trials on the roads and 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:51.150
 just cheeky robbers every year 

00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:52.320
 the spread of traumatic 

00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:54.390
 pistols in Russia 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:56.610
 increased the number of cases it 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:59.390
 use not only in self defense 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:02.780
 we are the number of incidents of the so-called 

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:05.280
 misuse of trauma 

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:07.280
 one of the clearest examples of controversial 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:09.440
 use of traumatic weapons 

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:11.700
 scandalous matter of alexander lotkovo 

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:12.600
 arranged shooting at the metro station 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:18.060
 color boulevard 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:20.189
 in Moscow on May 26, 2012 what is the reason 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:22.500
 such a large amount of excess 

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:25.170
 citizens of the so-called limits 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:27.689
 necessary defense in russia why 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:30.210
 weapons created to protect spawned 

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:32.820
 so many problems when we talk about 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:34.980
 traumatic gun situations 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:37.320
 self defense then the whole problem is it 

00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:39.960
 fair use is to 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:46.830
 the absurdity of the law that does not allow 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:49.230
 effectively protect yourself only look 

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:52.080
 so you can apply traumatic 

00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:52.710
 gun situations of self when on 

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:56.360
 you were attacked 

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:56.360
 need to remove weapons 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:06.020
 then make a weapon for shooting 

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:06.020
 having previously removed it from the fuse 

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:18.660
 attention must now be warned 

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:23.760
 on the use of weapons and only after that 

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:27.000
 start shooting and even necessary 

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:30.120
 wait until the offender can change 

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:33.120
 your plans and stop attacking is 

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:37.220
 law now let's calculate how much 

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:37.220
 time spent on all these preparations 

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:51.880
 as the form it took about four seconds and 

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:53.560
 now let's see what can 

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:56.610
 make a criminal in that time 

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:56.610
 armed with a knife 

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:10.180
 so in 4 seconds the offender managed 

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:14.050
 stab more than ten times with a knife 

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:16.720
 but that 's not all, even if you started 

00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:18.580
 shoot the attacker then by law you are not 

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:20.860
 have the right to fire from a distance 

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:23.440
 closer than 1 meter and you do not have the right 

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:25.030
 shoot in the face to the heart and groin 

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:27.310
 now imagine if 

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:30.340
 attackers have already begun to strike 

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:33.670
 knife you are closer 

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:35.830
 1 meter either way you are n’t 

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:39.340
 can control where you get into 

00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:43.480
 face area of ​​the heart or groin like that 

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:45.580
 laws in russia congratulate yourself in 

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:48.160
 Western countries such as America 

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:50.560
 Germany-France lawmakers long ago 

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:52.900
 understand that the person trying to protect 

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:54.900
 yourself from attack can not have time 

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:57.280
 on compliance with complex rules of application 

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:57.760
 gunshot or traumatic 

00:03:57.280 --> 00:04:00.520
 weapons 

00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:01.060
 so in the west the laws are very clear and 

00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:03.310
 clear 

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:06.070
 governs the right of citizens to their 

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:08.110
 self defense for example citizen 

00:04:06.070 --> 00:04:09.880
 united states of america can 

00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:12.610
 free to shoot at any uninvited 

00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:14.290
 guest who bursts into his house and beyond 

00:04:12.610 --> 00:04:16.720
 such actions will not only be 

00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:18.910
 punished we will receive thanks from 

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:21.340
 police officers in some 

00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:22.780
 European countries also any person 

00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:25.330
 can use self defense weapons 

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:27.790
 against any aggression without being considered 

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:30.850
 compliance with some difficult conditions or 

00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:32.980
 points of the law are quite obvious 

00:04:30.850 --> 00:04:35.860
 open unlawful intent with 

00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:38.169
 criminal side compared to 

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:40.210
 russia in western countries man himself 

00:04:38.169 --> 00:04:42.610
 feels much more protected 

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:45.669
 acquiring a weapon of self defense 

00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:47.740
 here's an example if a criminal swings 

00:04:45.669 --> 00:04:50.530
 begin to strike then by law 

00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:51.460
 Germany, France, USA, I have the right 

00:04:50.530 --> 00:04:58.500
 shoot him from the traumatic 

00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:58.500
 gun shoot point-blank 

00:05:00.419 --> 00:05:05.650
 in Russia for such self-defense you will be given 

00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:07.419
 term is another significant prime in 

00:05:05.650 --> 00:05:09.639
 united states of america if someone 

00:05:07.419 --> 00:05:12.669
 shows aggression against another 

00:05:09.639 --> 00:05:17.500
 human citizen usa can shoot 

00:05:12.669 --> 00:05:19.690
 a criminal in Russia for such actions 

00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:21.669
 you are accused of intentional infliction 

00:05:19.690 --> 00:05:24.070
 harm the criminal and go to jail 

00:05:21.669 --> 00:05:28.510
 why is it going hard to understand but 

00:05:24.070 --> 00:05:31.180
 This is a fact in Russia the imperfection of the law 

00:05:28.510 --> 00:05:33.550
 self defense and gun law say 

00:05:31.180 --> 00:05:35.590
 long ago however any amendments or 

00:05:33.550 --> 00:05:40.000
 supplements not only does not improve 

00:05:35.590 --> 00:05:42.040
 situations but also complicating the sensational 

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:44.110
 Alexander the case of Ivanov boxer 

00:05:42.040 --> 00:05:44.830
 novel Romanchuk pensioner Nicholas 

00:05:44.110 --> 00:05:46.840
 fiendish 

00:05:44.830 --> 00:05:48.610
 and many others would never have 

00:05:46.840 --> 00:05:51.040
 worried and not split 

00:05:48.610 --> 00:05:53.290
 public if the legal right to 

00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:55.210
 necessary defense in russia would be 

00:05:53.290 --> 00:05:56.830
 clearly defined and would allow 

00:05:55.210 --> 00:06:01.930
 to any person 

00:05:56.830 --> 00:06:03.550
 protect yourself what is reasonable 

00:06:01.930 --> 00:06:06.070
 be able to do if you have 

00:06:03.550 --> 00:06:08.200
 traumatic gun and how to protect 

00:06:06.070 --> 00:06:11.289
 their lives even breaking the absurd 

00:06:08.200 --> 00:06:12.760
 the requirements of the law life is more expensive because 

00:06:11.289 --> 00:06:14.830
 unexpected attack you are not only 

00:06:12.760 --> 00:06:16.300
 must quickly grab the weapon lead 

00:06:14.830 --> 00:06:18.970
 its on alert but also 

00:06:16.300 --> 00:06:22.560
 shoot so that the criminal could not 

00:06:18.970 --> 00:06:25.750
 for example get you a knife blow 

00:06:22.560 --> 00:06:27.430
 an expert is known for such a fact even if 

00:06:25.750 --> 00:06:29.800
 the criminal is at a distance 

00:06:27.430 --> 00:06:31.389
 few meters from the victim and starts 

00:06:29.800 --> 00:06:34.000
 pull together in order to inflict 

00:06:31.389 --> 00:06:37.200
 stabbing a man does not have time to snatch 

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:37.200
 weapon and defend yourself 

00:06:46.420 --> 00:06:51.760
 how to be how to save yourself see how 

00:06:50.290 --> 00:06:53.680
 only the attacker starts abruptly 

00:06:51.760 --> 00:06:55.990
 draw closer you have to move away quickly 

00:06:53.680 --> 00:06:58.860
 back while removing the weapon 

00:06:55.990 --> 00:07:01.950
 putting it on standby and 

00:06:58.860 --> 00:07:01.950
 start shooting 

00:07:07.290 --> 00:07:11.890
 Here is such a technique can save you if u 

00:07:10.210 --> 00:07:14.290
 you have a weapon of self defense 

00:07:11.890 --> 00:07:17.070
 try to master his second chance 

00:07:14.290 --> 00:07:17.070
 you may not be 

00:07:20.310 --> 00:07:25.020
 in Russia continue to make 

00:07:22.830 --> 00:07:27.720
 convictions to people who 

00:07:25.020 --> 00:07:30.480
 the opinion of the law exceed the measures necessary 

00:07:27.720 --> 00:07:32.550
 defense and we will only learn about the most 

00:07:30.480 --> 00:07:35.280
 high-profile cases facts about which 

00:07:32.550 --> 00:07:37.170
 seeps into the press why our 

00:07:35.280 --> 00:07:39.720
 experts from gaining laws about 

00:07:37.170 --> 00:07:43.580
 self-defense does not teach no western experience no 

00:07:39.720 --> 00:07:43.580
 common sense is not clear
