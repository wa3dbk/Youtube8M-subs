00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:11.099
 The Mannheimers have this season high 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:12.480
 Goals and you have them during the week 

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:14.759
 again with their two 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:17.850
 underwriting obligations underlined 

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:20.880
 Dennis Seidenberg and God's core 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:21.529
 the nhl back to mannheim is god 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:24.359
 at it 

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:26.640
 silk mountain arrives on friday in munich 

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:28.740
 you have completely different problems four goals 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:30.779
 in four, that's not exactly what they're playing 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:33.120
 the coach team exploited themselves 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:35.820
 had made in the face of this 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:39.350
 Torflaute adheres to the enthusiasm 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:41.640
 some fans in limits 

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:43.770
 We're going to the party in Munich 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:46.079
 Immediately try the folder in the hand too 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:48.210
 but not very much to take 

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:50.460
 the fans in lively discussion like them 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:53.250
 Helping your team can help 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:55.440
 On the other hand, you do not need to be a beggar 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:59.699
 and the puck fidgeted in the net 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:01:01.649
 Hitler shows it you have it right 

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:04.409
 Matthias Plachta still has the shot 

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:07.140
 deflected and gets hit him too 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:08.909
 the mannheimer fans credited out 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:10.170
 tried the cottage and munich 

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:12.510
 to hold against it 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:14.670
 From this angle felix is ​​a bridge man 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:17.549
 but not so easy to overcome 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:20.220
 and in the stadium was discussed how to 

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:22.740
 the eagle could trim the wings in 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:26.280
 At any rate, God did not fail 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:28.909
 pass on Michael Glumac who is in the eye 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:32.189
 and above all things with the shot 

00:01:28.909 --> 00:01:35.369
 beautiful hammer directly into the gate of 

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:37.229
 Munich the 20th 

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:38.369
 The Bernese fans are allowed to return 

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:41.040
 looking forward 

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:42.810
 seconds later munich in the overpaid 

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:45.060
 chance for the goal hit 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:47.009
 at first it looks pretty good then goes 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:50.130
 but it quickly into the 

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:51.210
 wrong direction marcus king on the way 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:54.869
 to the 3 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:57.979
 to zero a splendid place we traders 

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:57.979
 enjoy it again 

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:08.520
 13 o'clock not quite nine minutes for 

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:09.090
 The Mannheim fans was the world in 

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:10.860
 order 

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:12.810
 and if it already works outnumbered 

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:13.860
 then it will probably outnumber it 

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:16.530
 fold right 

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:19.890
 I'd like to break that 

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:21.780
 match hits also outnumbered 

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:23.880
 same right for everyone on this 

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:26.630
 We look at shorthander from wichert 

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:26.630
 Once again 

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:34.459
 the cheers of the Munich fans but one 

00:02:31.459 --> 00:02:36.530
 some times capable and red bull munich 

00:02:34.459 --> 00:02:38.540
 also wants to change this very quickly 

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:40.700
 second third of pat cortina im 

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:41.810
 attack and brügmann must go back behind 

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:44.660
 grab yourself 

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:48.380
 toni knight is to be reclaimed the 

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:52.340
 rebounds of martin hinterstocker are 

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:53.900
 diana is the fire in munich 

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:56.090
 again simply reason mannheim 

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:57.230
 They are really something in this phase 

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:59.269
 broken-winged 

00:02:57.230 --> 00:03:04.580
 stand wise about the scorer 

00:02:59.269 --> 00:03:05.989
 more or less only now became the 

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:08.060
 jubilation of Munich fans already one 

00:03:05.989 --> 00:03:10.790
 a bit euphoric of cleaning 

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:12.410
 later the euphoria brake sascha goc 

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:14.769
 lightning fast and then the puck is already 

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:18.349
 in the gate 

00:03:14.769 --> 00:03:20.720
 what a gamer to pass his third 

00:03:18.349 --> 00:03:23.750
 is in the game and at the same time 

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:25.370
 most beautiful but frank wall we want 

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:28.130
 Of course, do not forget yourself 

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:29.410
 Such templates must first be able 

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:31.940
 be recycled 

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:35.989
 who still rejoice the mannheimer fans 

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:38.299
 put Munich but not first ulrich 

00:03:35.989 --> 00:03:41.660
 masons with the big chance 

00:03:38.299 --> 00:03:42.410
 and then blake sloan with the next 

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:44.420
 possibility 

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:48.530
 the fire in munich is not yet 

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:50.630
 went out with 4 to 2 then went to the 

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:52.430
 Cabin in the last section of Munich 

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:55.400
 first again in the forward passage 

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:57.380
 lubor dibelka relies too much on the 

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:58.880
 taste of mannheimer defense and that 

00:03:57.380 --> 00:04:01.700
 he is informed immediately 

00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:03.880
 the pages harden slightly but the 

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:06.290
 fronts are cleared up quickly 

00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:07.790
 mannheim's trainer harold circle with the 

00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:09.709
 course of the last third not 

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:11.660
 he is happy for his nerves 

00:04:09.709 --> 00:04:14.140
 certainly more enjoyable if it is not anymore 

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:16.989
 is exciting well 

00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:19.120
 Thomas was not invented correctly 

00:04:16.989 --> 00:04:21.190
 residue oktoberfest mood on the 

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:23.140
 it was rumored that it was rumbling and that 

00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:26.140
 rightly Munich made it right again 

00:04:23.140 --> 00:04:27.070
 steam to a hit, however, it was enough 

00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:29.650
 no more 

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:33.070
 mannheim wins the game with 4 to 2 

00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:35.910
 and table leader cologne stays close up 

00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:35.910
 his heels 

00:04:36.390 --> 00:04:42.100
 pretty good game from us directly 

00:04:38.290 --> 00:04:43.390
 Markets made too many mistakes 

00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:45.640
 have and the possibilities to good 

00:04:43.390 --> 00:04:47.169
 chances are come then one is one 

00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:50.860
 play a bit more consistent and afterwards 

00:04:47.169 --> 00:04:51.669
 guess we have to play 60 minutes 

00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:53.680
 we are hard to beat 

00:04:51.669 --> 00:04:55.480
 we have the first quarter two times 

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:56.260
 little bit we sleep hard into 

00:04:55.480 --> 00:04:57.880
 found a game 

00:04:56.260 --> 00:04:59.050
 Finally, have a bit better 

00:04:57.880 --> 00:05:00.850
 played but unfortunately we do not have it 

00:04:59.050 --> 00:05:03.600
 managed to shoot the next goal 

00:05:00.850 --> 00:05:03.600
 and a connection
