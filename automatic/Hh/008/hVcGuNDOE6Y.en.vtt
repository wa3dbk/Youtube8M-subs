hello welcome to my tutorial I'm going

00:00:03.419 --> 00:00:05.960 
hello welcome to my tutorial I'm going
to<00:00:03.510> strap<00:00:03.750> and<00:00:03.899> repair<00:00:04.170> a<00:00:04.350> noisy<00:00:04.650> equal<00:00:05.040> ELC<00:00:05.730> -

00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:05.970 
to strap and repair a noisy equal ELC -

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:08.870 
to strap and repair a noisy equal ELC -
I<00:00:06.890> would<00:00:07.890> imagine<00:00:08.069> you<00:00:08.309> can<00:00:08.429> apply<00:00:08.670> this<00:00:08.730> to

00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:08.880 
I would imagine you can apply this to

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:10.820 
I would imagine you can apply this to
the<00:00:09.090> one<00:00:09.210> in<00:00:09.330> three<00:00:09.480> versions<00:00:09.690> of<00:00:10.019> the<00:00:10.200> popular

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:10.830 
the one in three versions of the popular

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:13.759 
the one in three versions of the popular
system<00:00:11.309> as<00:00:11.429> well<00:00:11.840> remove<00:00:12.840> the<00:00:12.990> edge<00:00:13.110> screws<00:00:13.440> on

and then see the CPU block yeah there

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:06.140 
and then see the CPU block yeah there
because<00:02:03.840> I<00:02:03.900> don't<00:02:03.960> know<00:02:04.170> what<00:02:04.850> like<00:02:05.850> wood<00:02:06.000> was

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:06.150 
because I don't know what like wood was

to remove the fun I keep on a load on

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:19.940 
to remove the fun I keep on a load on
because<00:02:17.670> it<00:02:17.790> protects<00:02:18.090> on<00:02:18.270> CD<00:02:18.540> radio<00:02:18.950> I'll

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:19.950 
because it protects on CD radio I'll

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:21.140 
because it protects on CD radio I'll
remove<00:02:20.160> it<00:02:20.310> now<00:02:20.430> because<00:02:20.760> we're<00:02:20.910> going<00:02:21.000> to<00:02:21.060> be
