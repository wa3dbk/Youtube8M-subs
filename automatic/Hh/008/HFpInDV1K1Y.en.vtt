00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:43.789 
in the top corner top center of e and
searched<00:01:40.229> value<00:01:40.710> 24<00:01:41.930> you<00:01:42.930> should<00:01:43.170> have<00:01:43.500> maybe

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:43.799 
searched value 24 you should have maybe

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:46.850 
searched value 24 you should have maybe
one<00:01:44.100> or<00:01:44.220> two<00:01:44.250> values<00:01:45.259> let's<00:01:46.259> pause<00:01:46.560> the<00:01:46.829> game

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:46.860 
one or two values let's pause the game

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:49.819 
one or two values let's pause the game
with<00:01:47.220> our<00:01:47.399> speed<00:01:47.729> hack<00:01:47.970> now<00:01:48.439> make<00:01:49.439> sure<00:01:49.470> we

00:01:49.819 --> 00:01:49.829 
with our speed hack now make sure we

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:52.730 
with our speed hack now make sure we
don't<00:01:49.860> die<00:01:50.250> here<00:01:50.930> we<00:01:51.930> won't<00:01:52.140> change<00:01:52.439> this

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:52.740 
don't die here we won't change this

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:56.560 
don't die here we won't change this
value<00:01:52.979> to<00:01:53.549> 120<00:01:54.360> this<00:01:55.290> will<00:01:55.350> boot<00:01:55.860> us<00:01:56.040> past

00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:56.570 
value to 120 this will boot us past

00:01:56.570 --> 00:01:58.969 
value to 120 this will boot us past
level<00:01:57.570> and<00:01:58.020> will<00:01:58.200> just<00:01:58.409> freeze<00:01:58.619> that<00:01:58.799> there

00:01:58.969 --> 00:01:58.979 
level and will just freeze that there

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:00.950 
level and will just freeze that there
this<00:01:59.280> will<00:01:59.430> buddhist<00:01:59.790> past<00:02:00.060> level<00:02:00.360> 15

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:00.960 
this will buddhist past level 15

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:02.690 
this will buddhist past level 15
therefore<00:02:01.439> we<00:02:01.619> won't<00:02:01.860> have<00:02:02.070> to<00:02:02.100> do<00:02:02.369> the<00:02:02.490> boss

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:02.700 
therefore we won't have to do the boss

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:06.050 
therefore we won't have to do the boss
and<00:02:03.170> like<00:02:04.170> many<00:02:04.469> have<00:02:04.740> tried<00:02:04.950> before<00:02:05.070> died<00:02:05.790> at

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:06.060 
and like many have tried before died at

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:08.600 
and like many have tried before died at
the<00:02:06.090> very<00:02:06.659> last<00:02:06.840> boss<00:02:07.170> in<00:02:07.380> game<00:02:07.649> it<00:02:07.979> just<00:02:08.009> makes

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:08.610 
the very last boss in game it just makes

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:11.900 
the very last boss in game it just makes
things<00:02:08.729> a<00:02:09.030> lot<00:02:09.179> simpler<00:02:10.009> so<00:02:11.009> this<00:02:11.220> is<00:02:11.400> a<00:02:11.520> level

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:11.910 
things a lot simpler so this is a level

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:12.950 
things a lot simpler so this is a level
hack

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:12.960 
hack

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:15.140
