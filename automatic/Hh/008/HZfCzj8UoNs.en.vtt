00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:07.780 

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:09.750 

again

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:09.760 
again

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:12.660 
again
then<00:03:10.239> you<00:03:10.330> get<00:03:10.480> all<00:03:10.659> the<00:03:10.780> way<00:03:10.900> to<00:03:10.959> this<00:03:11.670> switch

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:19.380 

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:22.710 

so<00:03:20.380> in<00:03:20.530> the<00:03:20.650> end<00:03:20.770> what<00:03:21.100> you'll<00:03:21.250> get<00:03:21.460> in<00:03:22.360> the<00:03:22.510> end

00:03:22.710 --> 00:03:22.720 
so in the end what you'll get in the end

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:53.710 
so in the end what you'll get in the end
it<00:03:22.990> should<00:03:23.170> be

00:03:53.710 --> 00:03:53.720 

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:58.630 

and<00:03:56.110> hopefully<00:03:57.110> with<00:03:57.650> a<00:03:57.710> bit<00:03:57.830> of<00:03:57.860> practice<00:03:58.130> you

00:03:58.630 --> 00:03:58.640 
and hopefully with a bit of practice you

00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:00.700 
and hopefully with a bit of practice you
should<00:03:58.670> be<00:03:58.880> able<00:03:58.970> to<00:03:59.060> play<00:03:59.240> it<00:03:59.380> better<00:04:00.380> than<00:04:00.530> me

00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:00.710 
should be able to play it better than me

00:04:00.710 --> 00:04:04.990 
should be able to play it better than me
so<00:04:01.570> get<00:04:02.570> practicing
