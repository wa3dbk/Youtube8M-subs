00:00:52.049 --> 00:00:52.059 
very thick long hair so this just lets

00:00:52.059 --> 00:00:55.529 
very thick long hair so this just lets
you<00:00:52.210> see<00:00:52.480> that<00:00:53.100> really<00:00:54.100> even<00:00:54.460> on<00:00:54.789> thick<00:00:55.180> here

00:00:55.529 --> 00:00:55.539 
you see that really even on thick here

00:00:55.539 --> 00:00:57.330 
you see that really even on thick here
you<00:00:55.780> can<00:00:55.989> get<00:00:56.170> that<00:00:56.350> bubble<00:00:56.800> round<00:00:57.010> a<00:00:57.190> few

00:00:57.330 --> 00:00:57.340 
you can get that bubble round a few

00:00:57.340 --> 00:00:59.070

the ponytail and really securely know

00:01:05.370 --> 00:01:09.600 
the ponytail and really securely know
why<00:01:06.370> invisible<00:01:07.320> it's<00:01:08.320> not<00:01:08.560> called<00:01:08.860> invisible

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:09.610 
why invisible it's not called invisible

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:11.370 
why invisible it's not called invisible
because<00:01:09.760> you<00:01:10.000> can't<00:01:10.240> see<00:01:10.480> it<00:01:10.570> because<00:01:10.750> clearly

00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:11.380 
because you can't see it because clearly

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:14.030 
because you can't see it because clearly
you<00:01:11.590> can<00:01:11.830> it's<00:01:12.370> called<00:01:12.700> invisible<00:01:13.000> because

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040 
you can it's called invisible because

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:17.610 
you can it's called invisible because
when<00:01:15.040> we<00:01:15.250> take<00:01:15.580> this<00:01:15.940> bubble<00:01:16.420> out<00:01:16.630> it<00:01:17.320> leaves

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:17.620 
when we take this bubble out it leaves

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:20.370 
when we take this bubble out it leaves
no<00:01:18.100> trace<00:01:18.700> in<00:01:19.000> the<00:01:19.330> hair<00:01:19.570> at<00:01:19.720> all<00:01:20.050> so<00:01:20.320> you

00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:20.380 
no trace in the hair at all so you

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:22.890 
no trace in the hair at all so you
cannot<00:01:20.860> tell<00:01:21.250> that<00:01:21.550> the<00:01:22.030> hair<00:01:22.300> has<00:01:22.479> been<00:01:22.690> in<00:01:22.810> a

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:26.370 
cannot tell that the hair has been in a
ponytail<00:01:23.229> so<00:01:24.100> say<00:01:24.310> for<00:01:24.340> example<00:01:24.640> you<00:01:25.420> need<00:01:25.990> to

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:36.310 
you can just put it round fill it twice

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:40.559 
you can just put it round fill it twice
and<00:02:36.790> it's<00:02:36.940> and<00:02:37.390> it's<00:02:37.510> done<00:02:37.860> no<00:02:39.569> invisible

is this is the way to go

00:03:23.709 --> 00:03:26.040 
is this is the way to go
and<00:03:24.040> one<00:03:24.790> of<00:03:24.910> the<00:03:25.030> common<00:03:25.420> problems<00:03:25.450> and

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:26.050 
and one of the common problems and

00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:28.259 
and one of the common problems and
actually<00:03:26.500> again<00:03:27.130> I've<00:03:27.310> experienced<00:03:28.120> this

00:03:28.259 --> 00:03:28.269 
actually again I've experienced this

00:03:28.269 --> 00:03:31.140 
actually again I've experienced this
myself<00:03:28.480> is<00:03:28.959> that<00:03:29.830> sometimes<00:03:30.549> when<00:03:30.760> you<00:03:30.940> have

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:31.150 
myself is that sometimes when you have

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:33.600 
myself is that sometimes when you have
your<00:03:31.299> hair<00:03:31.480> tied<00:03:31.780> back<00:03:32.019> for<00:03:32.560> a<00:03:32.830> longer<00:03:33.370> period

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:33.610 
your hair tied back for a longer period

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:36.660 
your hair tied back for a longer period
of<00:03:33.819> time<00:03:34.150> it<00:03:34.900> can<00:03:34.930> actually<00:03:35.440> cause<00:03:35.799> quite<00:03:36.610> a

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:36.670 
of time it can actually cause quite a

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:39.120 
of time it can actually cause quite a
lot<00:03:36.880> of<00:03:36.970> pain<00:03:37.330> and<00:03:37.630> the<00:03:38.260> reason<00:03:38.590> for<00:03:38.830> the<00:03:38.920> pain

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:39.130 
lot of pain and the reason for the pain

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:42.059 
lot of pain and the reason for the pain
is<00:03:39.370> that<00:03:39.519> the<00:03:39.670> hairs<00:03:39.880> under<00:03:40.450> tension<00:03:40.980> one<00:03:41.980> of

00:03:42.059 --> 00:03:42.069 
is that the hairs under tension one of

00:03:42.069 --> 00:03:44.759 
is that the hairs under tension one of
the<00:03:42.160> other<00:03:42.340> benefits<00:03:42.880> of<00:03:43.060> this<00:03:43.590> invisible<00:03:44.590> is

00:03:44.759 --> 00:03:44.769 
the other benefits of this invisible is

00:03:44.769 --> 00:03:47.850 
the other benefits of this invisible is
that<00:03:45.220> it<00:03:45.970> really<00:03:46.450> doesn't<00:03:47.170> give<00:03:47.650> you<00:03:47.830> that

00:03:47.850 --> 00:03:47.860 
that it really doesn't give you that

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:50.220 
that it really doesn't give you that
tension<00:03:48.580> headache<00:03:49.000> and<00:03:49.480> I<00:03:49.870> think<00:03:50.049> that's

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:50.230 
tension headache and I think that's

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:52.770 
tension headache and I think that's
really<00:03:50.470> important<00:03:51.040> and<00:03:51.330> so<00:03:52.330> it's<00:03:52.480> a<00:03:52.540> good

00:03:52.770 --> 00:03:52.780 
really important and so it's a good

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:54.300 
really important and so it's a good
thing<00:03:53.019> to<00:03:53.200> know<00:03:53.350> that<00:03:53.530> you<00:03:53.620> can<00:03:53.799> tie<00:03:54.010> your<00:03:54.040> hair

00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:54.310 
thing to know that you can tie your hair

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:56.099 
thing to know that you can tie your hair
back<00:03:54.549> and<00:03:54.819> not<00:03:55.000> have<00:03:55.180> that<00:03:55.329> real<00:03:55.660> sort<00:03:56.049> of

00:03:56.099 --> 00:03:56.109 
back and not have that real sort of

00:03:56.109 --> 00:03:57.509 
back and not have that real sort of
horrible<00:03:56.620> pain

00:03:57.509 --> 00:03:57.519 
horrible pain

00:03:57.519 --> 00:03:59.460 
horrible pain
I<00:03:57.549> think<00:03:58.120> it<00:03:58.209> often<00:03:58.510> actually<00:03:58.930> puts<00:03:59.170> people

00:03:59.460 --> 00:03:59.470 
I think it often actually puts people

00:03:59.470 --> 00:04:02.009 
I think it often actually puts people
off<00:03:59.590> tying<00:04:00.250> the<00:04:00.400> hair<00:04:00.549> back<00:04:01.019> another

00:04:02.009 --> 00:04:02.019 
off tying the hair back another

00:04:02.019 --> 00:04:04.110 
off tying the hair back another
important<00:04:02.530> thing<00:04:02.590> would<00:04:03.010> be<00:04:03.250> this<00:04:03.700> does<00:04:03.910> not

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:04.120 
important thing would be this does not

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:05.340 
important thing would be this does not
cause<00:04:04.390> any<00:04:04.420> splittings

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:05.350 
cause any splittings

00:04:05.350 --> 00:04:07.770 
cause any splittings
I've<00:04:05.799> seen<00:04:06.100> many<00:04:06.430> many<00:04:06.549> times<00:04:06.790> people<00:04:07.510> who

00:04:07.770 --> 00:04:07.780 
I've seen many many times people who

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:09.569 
I've seen many many times people who
have<00:04:07.989> to<00:04:08.200> tie<00:04:08.410> they're<00:04:08.620> here<00:04:08.769> but<00:04:08.950> regularly

00:04:09.569 --> 00:04:09.579 
have to tie they're here but regularly

00:04:09.579 --> 00:04:13.140 
have to tie they're here but regularly
with<00:04:10.540> here's<00:04:11.049> broken<00:04:11.680> just<00:04:12.160> exactly<00:04:12.579> where

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:13.150 
with here's broken just exactly where

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:15.900 
with here's broken just exactly where
the<00:04:13.420> band<00:04:13.630> has<00:04:13.989> been<00:04:14.019> in<00:04:14.680> the<00:04:15.010> hair<00:04:15.250> so<00:04:15.760> that

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:15.910 
the band has been in the hair so that

00:04:15.910 --> 00:04:17.279 
the band has been in the hair so that
would<00:04:16.030> be<00:04:16.120> another<00:04:16.209> reason<00:04:16.750> to<00:04:16.900> be<00:04:16.989> using

00:04:17.279 --> 00:04:17.289 
would be another reason to be using
