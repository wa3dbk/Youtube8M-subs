00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:11.839 
that surgeons need to practice more but
I'm<00:02:10.890> not<00:02:11.069> sure<00:02:11.280> that's<00:02:11.430> it

00:02:11.839 --> 00:02:11.849 
I'm not sure that's it

00:02:11.849 --> 00:02:13.160 
I'm not sure that's it
surgeons<00:02:12.480> practice

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:13.170 
surgeons practice

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:15.740 
surgeons practice
plenty<00:02:13.470> we<00:02:13.980> all<00:02:14.160> do<00:02:14.370> hundreds<00:02:14.760> of<00:02:14.880> cases<00:02:15.090> every

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:15.750 
plenty we all do hundreds of cases every

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:17.930 
plenty we all do hundreds of cases every
single<00:02:16.050> year<00:02:16.319> and<00:02:16.470> what<00:02:17.010> we<00:02:17.040> need<00:02:17.340> is<00:02:17.370> not<00:02:17.700> just

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:17.940 
single year and what we need is not just

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:20.540 
single year and what we need is not just
to<00:02:18.090> do<00:02:18.209> more<00:02:18.390> cases<00:02:18.870> but<00:02:19.440> to<00:02:19.620> learn<00:02:19.800> how<00:02:20.130> to<00:02:20.160> do

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:20.550 
to do more cases but to learn how to do

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:24.130 
to do more cases but to learn how to do
them<00:02:20.730> better<00:02:21.380> we<00:02:22.380> believe<00:02:22.770> that<00:02:23.040> a<00:02:23.250> systematic

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:24.140 
them better we believe that a systematic

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:26.960 
them better we believe that a systematic
data-driven<00:02:25.140> approach<00:02:25.410> to<00:02:26.250> coaching<00:02:26.730> could

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:26.970 
data-driven approach to coaching could

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:29.420 
data-driven approach to coaching could
make<00:02:27.120> all<00:02:27.330> surgeons<00:02:27.690> better<00:02:28.220> and<00:02:29.220> that

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:29.430 
make all surgeons better and that

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:32.090 
make all surgeons better and that
implies<00:02:29.850> not<00:02:30.420> simply<00:02:31.170> practice<00:02:31.770> but

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:32.100 
implies not simply practice but

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:34.490 
implies not simply practice but
deliberate<00:02:32.819> practice<00:02:33.330> coaching<00:02:34.110> and

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:34.500 
deliberate practice coaching and

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:37.280 
deliberate practice coaching and
feedback<00:02:34.530> about<00:02:35.340> what<00:02:35.940> it<00:02:36.150> is<00:02:36.330> about<00:02:36.660> the<00:02:37.170> way

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:37.290 
feedback about what it is about the way

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:38.900 
feedback about what it is about the way
that<00:02:37.590> we<00:02:37.739> do<00:02:37.920> certain<00:02:38.310> types<00:02:38.430> of<00:02:38.610> procedures

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:38.910 
that we do certain types of procedures

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:41.180 
that we do certain types of procedures
or<00:02:39.180> how<00:02:39.420> well<00:02:39.630> we<00:02:39.810> do<00:02:39.959> them<00:02:40.170> that<00:02:40.739> could<00:02:41.010> be

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:41.190 
or how well we do them that could be

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:43.370 
or how well we do them that could be
better
