00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:36.309
 hello guys and welcome back to the wardrobe 

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.530
 of you style today to talk about a theme 

00:00:36.309 --> 00:00:40.629
 important which is which women to buy 

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:42.910
 for autumn and winter 

00:00:40.629 --> 00:00:44.770
 I will show you a series of matches 

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:47.320
 and in such a way new models do not 

00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:49.480
 you may miss the first one, for example 

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:52.210
 outfit provides a mini one great 

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:54.879
 then return of a great classic that 

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:57.010
 if combined in an unusual way as in 

00:00:54.879 --> 00:00:59.019
 this case sequins plus a pullover 

00:00:57.010 --> 00:01:02.230
 choose it maybe not too tight and 

00:00:59.019 --> 00:01:04.750
 snug but also the soft esbwr 

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:07.509
 used and then we obviously match 

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:09.240
 your pantyhose is to mitigate the effect 

00:01:07.509 --> 00:01:11.050
 min and therefore not seem too much 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:13.149
 provocative but therefore to be able to 

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:15.700
 use a couple of all day 

00:01:13.149 --> 00:01:18.670
 men's shoes like these with buckles 

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:22.560
 a mini among hills and you will be perfect 

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:22.560
 instead we look at the second skirt 

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:31.220
 in this case you can buy instead 

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:33.530
 a longuette for which the tube skirt 

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:36.290
 snug and inspiring this 

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:39.200
 authorities some 40 years then mixed by 

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:40.640
 even with a blouse that leaves 

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:42.470
 glimpse the neck anyway 

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:45.050
 properly inserted into the 

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:47.690
 your pullover with a slightly coarse texture 

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:49.790
 then knit with braids of 

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:51.350
 coasts and there are some of these 

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:53.720
 processes that will be easy for you 

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:55.700
 find him an outerwear if you want to 

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:57.080
 be more glamorous put it on 

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:59.600
 shoulders otherwise put it on 

00:01:57.080 --> 00:02:02.060
 quietly it's a pair of shoes 

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:04.400
 these too are clearly inspired by the years 

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:07.070
 40 then with ankle straps o 

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:09.890
 that which links the 

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:12.530
 strap at the front of the 

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:14.720
 shoe for which however also sandals and 

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:16.850
 if you don't like it instead of wearing i 

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:19.250
 high heels you can also opt for a 

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:20.780
 masculine-inspired moccasin 

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:23.350
 then we see the third woman ad 

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:23.350
 buy 

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:34.579
 another purchase to make the full skirt 

00:02:32.299 --> 00:02:36.799
 which gives you a bit of that romantic air 

00:02:34.579 --> 00:02:39.319
 elegant bonton a little French though 

00:02:36.799 --> 00:02:42.560
 we want if you want to play with it 

00:02:39.319 --> 00:02:44.719
 even a shirt worn with a collar 

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:46.549
 open then no longer buttoned like 

00:02:44.719 --> 00:02:48.170
 fashion usually recommends us in 

00:02:46.549 --> 00:02:50.510
 so as to counter this 

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:53.120
 bonne effect then a little bonbonniÃ¨re tone 

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:55.489
 match us a bomberino however one 

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:58.639
 spencer a short jacket that therefore 

00:02:55.489 --> 00:03:01.400
 let us see the breadth of yours 

00:02:58.639 --> 00:03:05.269
 skirt created precisely on the hips and then 

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:07.370
 to complete your outfit opt 

00:03:05.269 --> 00:03:09.079
 lose high-heeled shoes because 

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:12.409
 at least slender the figure since 

00:03:09.079 --> 00:03:14.689
 you have this footprint around you like 

00:03:12.409 --> 00:03:17.510
 in my case of Mary Jane or of the 

00:03:14.689 --> 00:03:19.400
 shoes with rounded ends with one 

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:21.560
 series of straps and straps that 

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:22.819
 wrap your ankle 

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:25.659
 let's look at the next one 

00:03:22.819 --> 00:03:25.659
 woman to buy 

00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:34.620
 another purchase to make the other woman 

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:36.570
 piece because you know in the fashion courses 

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:38.390
 appeals all comes back so maybe you 

00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:40.890
 he found it again in your closet 

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:43.320
 since it gives them trapeze they are already 

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:46.110
 a little flared on the sides but anyway 

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:48.600
 without expanding, opt for a 

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:51.690
 pairing of a top that is from the 

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:53.820
 very graphic form without swaddling on 

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:56.580
 waist or hip us in jargon and 

00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:59.580
 say box as if it were just one 

00:03:56.580 --> 00:04:02.250
 box to guard you then add one 

00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:03.930
 shopper in this case I made rabbi 

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:06.240
 between the top because in one of the 

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:08.670
 seasonal patterns therefore very trendy 

00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:11.670
 to match a bright and decisive color 

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:15.280
 like fuchsia and then your tights 

00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:18.760
 covering is a pair of 

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:19.989
 ankle boots with chunky heels block the di 

00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:23.940
 great trend 

00:04:19.989 --> 00:04:23.940
 good shopping then girls hello
