okay<00:00:00.510> so<00:00:00.570> imagine<00:00:00.719> we<00:00:01.020> have<00:00:01.110> a<00:00:01.140> tank<00:00:01.350> like<00:00:01.530> this

00:00:01.730 --> 00:00:01.740 
okay so imagine we have a tank like this

00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:04.039 
okay so imagine we have a tank like this
with<00:00:02.159> a<00:00:02.190> layer<00:00:02.550> of<00:00:02.730> oil<00:00:02.939> floating<00:00:03.449> on<00:00:03.629> top<00:00:03.810> of<00:00:03.959> a

00:00:04.039 --> 00:00:04.049 
with a layer of oil floating on top of a

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:05.749 
with a layer of oil floating on top of a
layer<00:00:04.200> of<00:00:04.259> water<00:00:04.620> we<00:00:04.890> want<00:00:05.040> to<00:00:05.100> find<00:00:05.279> out<00:00:05.460> what

00:00:05.749 --> 00:00:05.759 
layer of water we want to find out what

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:07.490 
layer of water we want to find out what
is<00:00:05.970> the<00:00:06.210> pressure<00:00:06.390> at<00:00:06.720> the<00:00:06.839> bottom<00:00:07.049> of<00:00:07.379> the

00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:07.500 
is the pressure at the bottom of the

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:09.589 
is the pressure at the bottom of the
tank<00:00:07.649> if<00:00:07.950> it's<00:00:08.099> open<00:00:08.400> to<00:00:08.490> that<00:00:08.639> atmosphere<00:00:09.269> so

00:00:09.589 --> 00:00:09.599 
tank if it's open to that atmosphere so

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:11.150 
tank if it's open to that atmosphere so
first<00:00:09.960> of<00:00:10.050> all<00:00:10.139> let's<00:00:10.349> say<00:00:10.469> that<00:00:10.590> we<00:00:10.769> have<00:00:10.889> here

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:11.160 
first of all let's say that we have here

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:12.830 
first of all let's say that we have here
this<00:00:11.280> is<00:00:11.400> the<00:00:11.490> level<00:00:11.880> surface<00:00:12.120> touching<00:00:12.750> the

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:12.840 
this is the level surface touching the

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:13.879 
this is the level surface touching the
atmosphere<00:00:13.290> and<00:00:13.380> we're<00:00:13.469> going<00:00:13.590> to<00:00:13.650> say<00:00:13.740> that

00:00:13.879 --> 00:00:13.889 
atmosphere and we're going to say that

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:20.300 
atmosphere and we're going to say that
this<00:00:14.009> is<00:00:14.570> P<00:00:15.570> naught<00:00:15.780> equals<00:00:16.699> P<00:00:17.779> 80<00:00:18.779> M<00:00:19.500> all<00:00:20.250> right

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:20.310 
this is P naught equals P 80 M all right

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:22.370 
this is P naught equals P 80 M all right
first<00:00:21.150> of<00:00:21.240> all<00:00:21.300> let's<00:00:21.449> put<00:00:21.600> on<00:00:21.689> some<00:00:21.720> some

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:22.380 
first of all let's put on some some

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:24.710 
first of all let's put on some some
distances<00:00:22.800> here<00:00:23.010> let's<00:00:23.279> say<00:00:23.430> that<00:00:23.609> the<00:00:23.820> oil<00:00:24.090> or

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:24.720 
distances here let's say that the oil or

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:29.509 
distances here let's say that the oil or
the<00:00:24.960> water<00:00:25.609> say<00:00:26.609> that<00:00:26.760> the<00:00:26.820> water<00:00:27.000> is<00:00:28.519> 2.5

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:29.519 
the water say that the water is 2.5

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:32.709 
the water say that the water is 2.5
meters<00:00:30.390> deep<00:00:30.630> and<00:00:30.869> then<00:00:31.500> somehow<00:00:31.949> we<00:00:32.009> have

00:00:32.709 --> 00:00:32.719 
meters deep and then somehow we have

00:00:32.719 --> 00:00:35.030 
meters deep and then somehow we have
let's<00:00:33.719> say<00:00:33.870> one-and-a-half<00:00:34.410> meters<00:00:34.739> of<00:00:34.860> oil

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:35.040 
let's say one-and-a-half meters of oil

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:40.299 
let's say one-and-a-half meters of oil
floating<00:00:35.430> on<00:00:35.640> top<00:00:35.670> it's<00:00:36.270> a<00:00:36.360> lot<00:00:36.450> of<00:00:36.480> oil<00:00:38.450> okay

00:00:40.299 --> 00:00:40.309 
floating on top it's a lot of oil okay

00:00:40.309 --> 00:00:42.020 
floating on top it's a lot of oil okay
we're<00:00:41.309> going<00:00:41.399> to<00:00:41.460> need<00:00:41.640> to<00:00:41.730> know<00:00:41.760> what<00:00:41.940> the

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:42.030 
we're going to need to know what the

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:43.310 
we're going to need to know what the
densities<00:00:42.420> are<00:00:42.600> so<00:00:42.780> let's<00:00:42.930> say<00:00:43.050> that<00:00:43.079> this<00:00:43.230> is

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:43.320 
densities are so let's say that this is

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:48.229 
densities are so let's say that this is
all<00:00:43.469> at<00:00:43.590> 20<00:00:43.950> degrees<00:00:44.309> Celsius<00:00:45.980> and<00:00:46.980> let's<00:00:47.969> so

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239 
all at 20 degrees Celsius and let's so

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:50.180 
all at 20 degrees Celsius and let's so
that<00:00:48.390> would<00:00:48.510> mean<00:00:48.660> that<00:00:48.690> our<00:00:48.899> our<00:00:49.530> water<00:00:49.890> has<00:00:50.129> a

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
that would mean that our our water has a

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:59.139 
that would mean that our our water has a
density<00:00:53.449> water<00:00:54.449> has<00:00:54.690> a<00:00:54.719> density<00:00:54.809> of<00:00:56.239> 998

00:00:59.139 --> 00:00:59.149 
density water has a density of 998

00:00:59.149 --> 00:01:03.110 
density water has a density of 998
kilograms<00:01:00.149> per<00:01:00.359> cubic<00:01:00.800> meter<00:01:01.800> all<00:01:02.190> right<00:01:02.940> add

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
kilograms per cubic meter all right add

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:04.939 
kilograms per cubic meter all right add
20<00:01:03.539> degrees<00:01:03.840> Celsius<00:01:04.229> you<00:01:04.379> can<00:01:04.500> find<00:01:04.710> that<00:01:04.799> in

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949 
20 degrees Celsius you can find that in

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:06.830 
20 degrees Celsius you can find that in
a<00:01:05.040> table<00:01:05.220> and<00:01:05.460> a<00:01:05.549> fluids<00:01:05.909> or<00:01:06.090> a<00:01:06.119> thermodynamics

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:06.840 
a table and a fluids or a thermodynamics

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:10.070 
a table and a fluids or a thermodynamics
textbook<00:01:07.110> let's<00:01:07.890> say<00:01:08.010> your<00:01:08.130> oil<00:01:09.020> has<00:01:10.020> a

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080 
textbook let's say your oil has a

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:13.760 
textbook let's say your oil has a
specific<00:01:10.740> gravity<00:01:12.229> there's<00:01:13.229> a<00:01:13.290> specific

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
specific gravity there's a specific

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:18.020 
specific gravity there's a specific
gravity<00:01:13.950> of<00:01:14.900> 0.8<00:01:16.430> well<00:01:17.430> that<00:01:17.580> just<00:01:17.670> means<00:01:17.850> that

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
gravity of 0.8 well that just means that

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:20.660 
gravity of 0.8 well that just means that
it's<00:01:18.420> going<00:01:18.630> to<00:01:18.689> be<00:01:18.840> zero<00:01:19.170> like<00:01:19.560> 80%<00:01:19.890> as<00:01:20.400> dense

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
it's going to be zero like 80% as dense

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:23.960 
it's going to be zero like 80% as dense
as<00:01:20.880> as<00:01:21.570> the<00:01:22.020> water<00:01:22.310> that<00:01:23.310> we're<00:01:23.430> referencing

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
as as the water that we're referencing

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:28.010 
as as the water that we're referencing
so<00:01:24.240> all<00:01:24.659> we<00:01:25.020> have<00:01:25.140> to<00:01:25.229> do<00:01:25.380> is<00:01:25.619> take<00:01:26.240> our<00:01:27.240> density

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
so all we have to do is take our density

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:34.490 
so all we have to do is take our density
over<00:01:28.409> oil<00:01:29.900> is<00:01:30.900> equal<00:01:31.200> to<00:01:31.549> 0.8<00:01:32.990> times<00:01:33.990> density

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
over oil is equal to 0.8 times density

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:39.649 
over oil is equal to 0.8 times density
of<00:01:34.799> our<00:01:35.009> water<00:01:36.200> so<00:01:37.200> that<00:01:37.470> means<00:01:37.799> 0.8<00:01:38.369> times<00:01:38.659> 998

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:39.659 
of our water so that means 0.8 times 998

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:42.850 
of our water so that means 0.8 times 998
that's<00:01:39.960> going<00:01:40.170> to<00:01:40.229> give<00:01:40.350> us<00:01:40.380> value<00:01:40.799> of<00:01:41.689> 798

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:42.860 
that's going to give us value of 798

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:48.950 
that's going to give us value of 798
point<00:01:43.860> four<00:01:44.310> kilograms<00:01:45.530> per<00:01:46.530> cubic<00:01:46.790> meter<00:01:47.960> all

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:48.960 
point four kilograms per cubic meter all

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:50.300 
point four kilograms per cubic meter all
right<00:01:49.200> so<00:01:49.470> now<00:01:49.590> we<00:01:49.649> have<00:01:49.799> all<00:01:49.829> the<00:01:50.130> information

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.310 
right so now we have all the information

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:52.429 
right so now we have all the information
we<00:01:50.549> need<00:01:50.850> to<00:01:50.880> solve<00:01:51.390> what<00:01:51.780> is<00:01:51.990> the<00:01:52.140> pressure

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:52.439 
we need to solve what is the pressure

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:56.569 
we need to solve what is the pressure
down<00:01:53.100> here<00:01:53.960> you<00:01:54.960> can<00:01:55.079> even<00:01:55.229> say<00:01:55.579> pressure

00:01:56.569 --> 00:01:56.579 
down here you can even say pressure

00:01:56.579 --> 00:01:59.690 
down here you can even say pressure
equals<00:01:57.329> question<00:01:58.079> mark<00:01:58.350> so<00:01:59.159> maybe<00:01:59.310> let's<00:01:59.520> call

00:01:59.690 --> 00:01:59.700 
equals question mark so maybe let's call

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:01.280 
equals question mark so maybe let's call
this<00:01:59.850> level<00:02:00.090> here<00:02:00.420> actually<00:02:00.840> let's<00:02:00.990> call<00:02:01.049> this

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:01.290 
this level here actually let's call this

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:04.130 
this level here actually let's call this
level<00:02:01.530> one<00:02:01.890> so<00:02:02.189> this<00:02:02.340> will<00:02:02.520> be<00:02:02.790> P<00:02:03.329> one<00:02:03.540> you<00:02:04.020> know

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:04.140 
level one so this will be P one you know

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:06.679 
level one so this will be P one you know
at<00:02:04.350> this<00:02:04.530> boundary<00:02:04.950> and<00:02:05.729> this<00:02:06.240> we'll<00:02:06.509> call

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:06.689 
at this boundary and this we'll call

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:08.660 
at this boundary and this we'll call
this<00:02:06.840> you<00:02:07.380> know<00:02:07.500> level<00:02:07.770> two<00:02:07.920> at<00:02:08.039> the<00:02:08.129> bottom<00:02:08.250> so

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:08.670 
this you know level two at the bottom so

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:10.609 
this you know level two at the bottom so
this<00:02:08.789> is<00:02:08.940> also<00:02:09.209> going<00:02:09.300> to<00:02:09.360> be<00:02:09.450> equal<00:02:09.750> to<00:02:09.929> P<00:02:10.349> two

00:02:10.609 --> 00:02:10.619 
this is also going to be equal to P two

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:12.670 
this is also going to be equal to P two
you<00:02:11.039> know<00:02:11.129> at<00:02:11.250> the<00:02:11.340> very<00:02:11.520> bottom<00:02:11.760> of<00:02:11.970> the<00:02:12.090> tank

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:12.680 
you know at the very bottom of the tank

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:15.640 
you know at the very bottom of the tank
and<00:02:12.830> we<00:02:13.610> already<00:02:13.790> said<00:02:14.030> this<00:02:14.180> is<00:02:14.299> P<00:02:14.450> not<00:02:14.659> so

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:15.650 
and we already said this is P not so

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:17.559 
and we already said this is P not so
first<00:02:16.220> of<00:02:16.340> all<00:02:16.430> so<00:02:16.730> we<00:02:16.849> want<00:02:17.060> to<00:02:17.120> first<00:02:17.299> want<00:02:17.510> to

00:02:17.559 --> 00:02:17.569 
first of all so we want to first want to

00:02:17.569 --> 00:02:19.210 
first of all so we want to first want to
calculate<00:02:17.720> for<00:02:17.959> p1<00:02:18.260> we<00:02:18.560> could<00:02:18.709> do<00:02:18.799> this<00:02:18.950> kind

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:19.220 
calculate for p1 we could do this kind

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:21.100 
calculate for p1 we could do this kind
of<00:02:19.310> one<00:02:19.790> fluid<00:02:20.090> at<00:02:20.330> a<00:02:20.360> time<00:02:20.629> because<00:02:20.900> they<00:02:20.989> have

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:21.110 
of one fluid at a time because they have

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:24.250 
of one fluid at a time because they have
different<00:02:21.530> densities<00:02:22.209> so<00:02:23.209> first<00:02:24.110> of<00:02:24.200> all

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:24.260 
different densities so first of all

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:26.589 
different densities so first of all
calculate<00:02:24.470> pressure<00:02:24.890> at<00:02:25.220> p1<00:02:25.489> so<00:02:25.879> we<00:02:26.000> have<00:02:26.150> P<00:02:26.569> 1

00:02:26.589 --> 00:02:26.599 
calculate pressure at p1 so we have P 1

00:02:26.599 --> 00:02:34.960 
calculate pressure at p1 so we have P 1
is<00:02:27.379> equal<00:02:27.830> to<00:02:28.420> P<00:02:29.420> naught<00:02:29.659> plus<00:02:30.489> Rho<00:02:31.489> G<00:02:32.079> H<00:02:33.970> okay

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:34.970 
is equal to P naught plus Rho G H okay

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:35.710 
is equal to P naught plus Rho G H okay
so<00:02:35.030> P<00:02:35.360> naught

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:35.720 
so P naught

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:37.030 
so P naught
I<00:02:35.750> guess<00:02:36.049> well<00:02:36.260> maybe<00:02:36.470> you<00:02:36.590> have<00:02:36.680> to<00:02:36.799> say<00:02:36.920> what

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:37.040 
I guess well maybe you have to say what

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:38.470 
I guess well maybe you have to say what
the<00:02:37.190> atmospheric<00:02:37.670> pressure<00:02:37.700> is<00:02:37.970> let's<00:02:38.360> say

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:38.480 
the atmospheric pressure is let's say

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:39.610 
the atmospheric pressure is let's say
that<00:02:38.659> in<00:02:38.810> this<00:02:38.870> case<00:02:38.930> the<00:02:39.200> atmospheric

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:39.620 
that in this case the atmospheric

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:44.140 
that in this case the atmospheric
pressure<00:02:39.650> is<00:02:39.920> 101<00:02:41.140> kiloPascals<00:02:42.970> this<00:02:43.970> could

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:44.150 
pressure is 101 kiloPascals this could

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:45.520 
pressure is 101 kiloPascals this could
change<00:02:44.180> if<00:02:44.599> you<00:02:44.720> know<00:02:44.780> here<00:02:44.989> at<00:02:45.079> the<00:02:45.170> top<00:02:45.319> of<00:02:45.470> a

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:45.530 
change if you know here at the top of a

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:47.710 
change if you know here at the top of a
mountain<00:02:45.890> or<00:02:46.040> something<00:02:46.609> or<00:02:46.730> below<00:02:47.209> the<00:02:47.390> ocean

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:47.720 
mountain or something or below the ocean

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:49.869 
mountain or something or below the ocean
sea<00:02:48.170> level<00:02:48.440> but<00:02:48.620> words<00:02:48.859> can<00:02:49.129> say<00:02:49.250> this<00:02:49.340> is<00:02:49.459> 101

00:02:49.869 --> 00:02:49.879 
sea level but words can say this is 101

00:02:49.879 --> 00:02:55.900 
sea level but words can say this is 101
kiloPascals<00:02:50.799> so<00:02:51.799> we<00:02:51.920> have<00:02:52.040> 100<00:02:52.519> and<00:02:54.910> 1000

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:55.910 
kiloPascals so we have 100 and 1000

00:02:55.910 --> 00:03:03.099 
kiloPascals so we have 100 and 1000
Pascal's<00:02:58.870> plus<00:02:59.870> we<00:03:00.530> have<00:03:01.450> the<00:03:02.450> first<00:03:02.840> layer<00:03:03.079> is

00:03:03.099 --> 00:03:03.109 
Pascal's plus we have the first layer is

00:03:03.109 --> 00:03:10.559 
Pascal's plus we have the first layer is
oil<00:03:03.560> so<00:03:03.799> we<00:03:03.890> have<00:03:04.010> our<00:03:04.180> density<00:03:05.180> is<00:03:06.849> 798<00:03:08.109> 0.4

00:03:10.559 --> 00:03:10.569 
oil so we have our density is 798 0.4

00:03:10.569 --> 00:03:17.339 
oil so we have our density is 798 0.4
kilogram<00:03:11.569> per<00:03:11.810> cubic<00:03:12.170> meter<00:03:13.269> times<00:03:14.349> 9.81

00:03:17.339 --> 00:03:17.349

kilogram per cubic meter times 9.81
m/s^2<00:03:18.849> times<00:03:19.849> H<00:03:20.180> that's<00:03:20.660> going<00:03:21.019> to<00:03:21.079> be<00:03:21.200> this

00:03:21.339 --> 00:03:21.349 
m/s^2 times H that's going to be this

00:03:21.349 --> 00:03:22.930 
m/s^2 times H that's going to be this
from<00:03:21.739> the<00:03:21.829> surface<00:03:22.160> down<00:03:22.340> to<00:03:22.489> 1<00:03:22.669> that's<00:03:22.819> the

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:22.940 
from the surface down to 1 that's the

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:25.360 
from the surface down to 1 that's the
difference<00:03:23.359> in<00:03:23.660> you<00:03:24.349> know<00:03:24.470> in<00:03:24.709> height<00:03:25.130> it's

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:25.370 
difference in you know in height it's

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:29.319 
difference in you know in height it's
going<00:03:25.519> to<00:03:25.579> be<00:03:25.639> 1.5<00:03:26.209> meters<00:03:26.709> and<00:03:28.120> again<00:03:29.120> if<00:03:29.239> you

00:03:29.319 --> 00:03:29.329 
going to be 1.5 meters and again if you

00:03:29.329 --> 00:03:30.369 
going to be 1.5 meters and again if you
multiply<00:03:29.660> all<00:03:29.750> these<00:03:29.870> together<00:03:30.019> you're<00:03:30.290> going

00:03:30.369 --> 00:03:30.379 
multiply all these together you're going

00:03:30.379 --> 00:03:34.270 
multiply all these together you're going
to<00:03:30.440> get<00:03:30.560> units<00:03:30.889> of<00:03:31.010> Pascal's<00:03:31.930> so<00:03:32.930> we<00:03:33.079> get<00:03:33.280> 100

00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:34.280 
to get units of Pascal's so we get 100

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:39.159 
to get units of Pascal's so we get 100
and<00:03:35.500> 1000<00:03:36.500> Pascal's<00:03:37.030> plus<00:03:38.030> when<00:03:38.750> you<00:03:38.840> multiply

00:03:39.159 --> 00:03:39.169 
and 1000 Pascal's plus when you multiply

00:03:39.169 --> 00:03:41.159 
and 1000 Pascal's plus when you multiply
all<00:03:39.290> these<00:03:39.470> together<00:03:39.859> we<00:03:40.190> will<00:03:40.370> get<00:03:40.519> about

00:03:41.159 --> 00:03:41.169 
all these together we will get about

00:03:41.169 --> 00:03:46.869 
all these together we will get about
11,000<00:03:43.299> 748<00:03:45.190> Pascal's<00:03:46.190> and<00:03:46.430> when<00:03:46.669> we<00:03:46.790> add

00:03:46.869 --> 00:03:46.879 
11,000 748 Pascal's and when we add

00:03:46.879 --> 00:03:53.520 
11,000 748 Pascal's and when we add
these<00:03:47.000> together<00:03:47.209> we<00:03:47.569> just<00:03:47.810> get<00:03:50.590> 112,000<00:03:51.970> 748

00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:53.530 
these together we just get 112,000 748

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:56.500 
these together we just get 112,000 748
Pascal's<00:03:54.760> all<00:03:55.760> right<00:03:55.940> so<00:03:56.120> now<00:03:56.239> we<00:03:56.299> know<00:03:56.480> that

00:03:56.500 --> 00:03:56.510 
Pascal's all right so now we know that

00:03:56.510 --> 00:03:59.680 
Pascal's all right so now we know that
this<00:03:56.810> is<00:03:57.280> p1<00:03:58.280> so<00:03:58.910> what<00:03:59.030> we<00:03:59.120> can<00:03:59.209> do<00:03:59.329> now<00:03:59.480> is<00:03:59.599> we

00:03:59.680 --> 00:03:59.690 
this is p1 so what we can do now is we

00:03:59.690 --> 00:04:01.629 
this is p1 so what we can do now is we
can<00:03:59.810> use<00:03:59.959> p1<00:04:00.410> to<00:04:00.620> calculate<00:04:01.099> the<00:04:01.280> difference

00:04:01.629 --> 00:04:01.639 
can use p1 to calculate the difference

00:04:01.639 --> 00:04:06.580 
can use p1 to calculate the difference
in<00:04:01.790> pressure<00:04:01.940> from<00:04:02.449> p1<00:04:02.720> to<00:04:02.930> p2<00:04:04.480> so<00:04:05.480> maybe<00:04:06.349> let's

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:06.590 
in pressure from p1 to p2 so maybe let's

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:11.140 
in pressure from p1 to p2 so maybe let's
change<00:04:06.769> colors<00:04:07.099> here<00:04:07.599> so<00:04:08.599> we'll<00:04:08.780> have<00:04:09.760> p2<00:04:10.760> is

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:11.150 
change colors here so we'll have p2 is

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:16.000 
change colors here so we'll have p2 is
going<00:04:11.419> to<00:04:11.629> equal<00:04:11.780> now<00:04:12.530> p1<00:04:13.190> plus<00:04:14.109> Rho<00:04:15.109> G<00:04:15.470> H

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:16.010 
going to equal now p1 plus Rho G H

00:04:16.010 --> 00:04:17.620 
going to equal now p1 plus Rho G H
you'll<00:04:16.370> see<00:04:16.489> this<00:04:16.609> this<00:04:16.820> formula<00:04:17.030> is<00:04:17.329> just<00:04:17.539> the

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:17.630 
you'll see this this formula is just the

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:20.370 
you'll see this this formula is just the
difference<00:04:18.049> you<00:04:18.349> know<00:04:18.470> difference<00:04:19.160> in<00:04:19.370> in

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:20.380 
difference you know difference in in

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:22.659 
difference you know difference in in
depths<00:04:21.380> of<00:04:21.530> a<00:04:21.620> fluid<00:04:21.979> so<00:04:22.130> we<00:04:22.250> conveniently

00:04:22.659 --> 00:04:22.669 
depths of a fluid so we conveniently

00:04:22.669 --> 00:04:23.980 
depths of a fluid so we conveniently
usually<00:04:23.120> use<00:04:23.240> for<00:04:23.419> the<00:04:23.479> surface<00:04:23.780> but<00:04:23.900> if

00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:23.990 
usually use for the surface but if

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:25.350 
usually use for the surface but if
there's<00:04:24.140> two<00:04:24.349> different

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:25.360 
there's two different

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:26.610 
there's two different
fluids<00:04:25.599> and<00:04:25.780> we<00:04:25.840> have<00:04:25.990> to<00:04:26.139> you<00:04:26.229> know<00:04:26.319> use<00:04:26.500> the

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:26.620 
fluids and we have to you know use the

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:28.589 
fluids and we have to you know use the
different<00:04:26.860> boundaries<00:04:27.419> because<00:04:28.419> obviously

00:04:28.589 --> 00:04:28.599 
different boundaries because obviously

00:04:28.599 --> 00:04:30.929 
different boundaries because obviously
the<00:04:28.900> densities<00:04:29.319> change<00:04:29.560> so<00:04:30.430> anyways<00:04:30.699> we<00:04:30.849> have

00:04:30.929 --> 00:04:30.939 
the densities change so anyways we have

00:04:30.939 --> 00:04:35.879 
the densities change so anyways we have
p1<00:04:31.180> this<00:04:31.629> is<00:04:31.719> going<00:04:31.840> to<00:04:31.900> be<00:04:32.039> one<00:04:33.659> 112<00:04:34.889> seven

00:04:35.879 --> 00:04:35.889 
p1 this is going to be one 112 seven

00:04:35.889 --> 00:04:39.779 
p1 this is going to be one 112 seven
four<00:04:36.280> eight<00:04:37.770> Pascal's<00:04:38.770> plus<00:04:39.310> now<00:04:39.490> we're<00:04:39.699> using

00:04:39.779 --> 00:04:39.789 
four eight Pascal's plus now we're using

00:04:39.789 --> 00:04:42.360 
four eight Pascal's plus now we're using
a<00:04:40.000> density<00:04:40.389> of<00:04:40.479> water<00:04:41.009> so<00:04:42.009> we're<00:04:42.129> going<00:04:42.250> to

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:42.370 
a density of water so we're going to

00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:43.589 
a density of water so we're going to
drop<00:04:42.460> the<00:04:42.610> units<00:04:42.819> to<00:04:42.849> save<00:04:43.060> some<00:04:43.210> time<00:04:43.240> we'll

00:04:43.589 --> 00:04:43.599 
drop the units to save some time we'll

00:04:43.599 --> 00:04:47.659 
drop the units to save some time we'll
have<00:04:43.860> 998<00:04:44.879> kilogram<00:04:45.879> per<00:04:46.060> meter<00:04:46.330> cubed<00:04:46.990> times

00:04:47.659 --> 00:04:47.669 
have 998 kilogram per meter cubed times

00:04:47.669 --> 00:04:52.439 
have 998 kilogram per meter cubed times
9.81<00:04:48.990> m/s^2<00:04:50.280> times<00:04:51.280> H<00:04:51.639> is<00:04:51.879> going<00:04:52.060> to<00:04:52.150> be<00:04:52.240> from

00:04:52.439 --> 00:04:52.449 
9.81 m/s^2 times H is going to be from

00:04:52.449 --> 00:04:54.029 
9.81 m/s^2 times H is going to be from
the<00:04:52.569> difference<00:04:52.870> from<00:04:52.960> here<00:04:53.050> to<00:04:53.530> here<00:04:53.860> which

00:04:54.029 --> 00:04:54.039 
the difference from here to here which

00:04:54.039 --> 00:04:55.679 
the difference from here to here which
will<00:04:54.159> be<00:04:54.250> two<00:04:54.430> point<00:04:54.669> five<00:04:54.849> meters

00:04:55.679 --> 00:04:55.689 
will be two point five meters

00:04:55.689 --> 00:04:57.779 
will be two point five meters
times<00:04:55.900> two<00:04:56.169> point<00:04:56.319> five<00:04:56.590> meters<00:04:57.159> and<00:04:57.430> again

times two point five meters and again

00:04:57.789 --> 00:05:00.029 
times two point five meters and again
it's<00:04:57.969> all<00:04:58.090> turn<00:04:58.270> out<00:04:58.360> to<00:04:58.449> be<00:04:58.479> Pascal's<00:04:58.990> so<00:04:59.919> we

00:05:00.029 --> 00:05:00.039 
it's all turn out to be Pascal's so we

00:05:00.039 --> 00:05:06.209 
it's all turn out to be Pascal's so we
get<00:05:00.159> 112<00:05:01.830> seven<00:05:02.830> four<00:05:03.129> eight<00:05:03.430> plus<00:05:04.830> this<00:05:05.830> term

00:05:06.209 --> 00:05:06.219 
get 112 seven four eight plus this term

00:05:06.219 --> 00:05:11.610 
get 112 seven four eight plus this term
becomes<00:05:06.789> twenty<00:05:07.419> four<00:05:07.599> thousand<00:05:10.620> four

00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:11.620 
becomes twenty four thousand four

00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:13.920 
becomes twenty four thousand four
hundred<00:05:11.860> and<00:05:12.279> seventy<00:05:12.909> six<00:05:13.270> this<00:05:13.599> is<00:05:13.659> all

00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:13.930 
hundred and seventy six this is all

00:05:13.930 --> 00:05:15.240 
hundred and seventy six this is all
Pascal's<00:05:14.469> and<00:05:14.680> when<00:05:14.770> we<00:05:14.860> add<00:05:14.949> these<00:05:15.069> together

00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:15.250 
Pascal's and when we add these together

00:05:15.250 --> 00:05:17.939 
Pascal's and when we add these together
we're<00:05:15.550> going<00:05:15.639> to<00:05:15.729> find<00:05:15.909> that<00:05:16.029> p2<00:05:16.389> is<00:05:16.960> going<00:05:17.860> to

00:05:17.939 --> 00:05:17.949 
we're going to find that p2 is going to

00:05:17.949 --> 00:05:21.260 
we're going to find that p2 is going to
equal<00:05:18.099> about<00:05:18.610> one<00:05:18.969> hundred<00:05:19.360> and<00:05:19.509> thirty-seven

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:21.270 
equal about one hundred and thirty-seven

00:05:21.270 --> 00:05:23.369 
equal about one hundred and thirty-seven
thousand<00:05:22.270> two<00:05:22.479> hundred<00:05:22.509> and<00:05:22.870> twenty<00:05:23.169> four

00:05:23.369 --> 00:05:23.379 
thousand two hundred and twenty four

00:05:23.379 --> 00:05:28.409 
thousand two hundred and twenty four
Pascal's<00:05:24.629> or<00:05:26.520> probably<00:05:27.520> more<00:05:27.879> conveniently

00:05:28.409 --> 00:05:28.419 
Pascal's or probably more conveniently

00:05:28.419 --> 00:05:31.409 
Pascal's or probably more conveniently
we<00:05:28.629> can<00:05:28.779> say<00:05:28.960> that<00:05:29.370> P<00:05:30.370> two<00:05:30.639> is<00:05:30.669> going<00:05:31.180> to<00:05:31.270> equal

00:05:31.409 --> 00:05:31.419 
we can say that P two is going to equal

00:05:31.419 --> 00:05:34.339 
we can say that P two is going to equal
about<00:05:32.110> a<00:05:32.169> hundred<00:05:32.680> and<00:05:32.710> thirty-seven

00:05:34.339 --> 00:05:34.349 
about a hundred and thirty-seven

00:05:34.349 --> 00:05:37.409 
about a hundred and thirty-seven
kilo<00:05:35.349> Pascal's<00:05:35.889> so<00:05:36.610> that's<00:05:36.759> like<00:05:36.879> if<00:05:37.150> you<00:05:37.270> have

00:05:37.409 --> 00:05:37.419 
kilo Pascal's so that's like if you have

00:05:37.419 --> 00:05:38.850 
kilo Pascal's so that's like if you have
you<00:05:37.629> could<00:05:37.719> have<00:05:37.900> more<00:05:38.110> fluids<00:05:38.500> in<00:05:38.620> this<00:05:38.740> you

00:05:38.850 --> 00:05:38.860 
you could have more fluids in this you

00:05:38.860 --> 00:05:40.350 
you could have more fluids in this you
could<00:05:39.009> have<00:05:39.039> you<00:05:39.339> know<00:05:39.430> three<00:05:39.669> or<00:05:39.849> four<00:05:39.909> fluids

00:05:40.350 --> 00:05:40.360 
could have you know three or four fluids

00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:41.610 
could have you know three or four fluids
stacked<00:05:40.569> on<00:05:40.719> top<00:05:40.750> of<00:05:40.870> each<00:05:41.050> other<00:05:41.229> and<00:05:41.379> as<00:05:41.500> long

00:05:41.610 --> 00:05:41.620 
stacked on top of each other and as long

00:05:41.620 --> 00:05:42.959 
stacked on top of each other and as long
as<00:05:41.650> they're<00:05:41.860> not<00:05:41.979> all<00:05:42.099> mixed<00:05:42.370> up<00:05:42.430> together<00:05:42.610> if

00:05:42.959 --> 00:05:42.969 
as they're not all mixed up together if

00:05:42.969 --> 00:05:44.279 
as they're not all mixed up together if
they<00:05:43.150> can<00:05:43.360> separate<00:05:43.690> out<00:05:43.810> into<00:05:44.020> these<00:05:44.110> nice

00:05:44.279 --> 00:05:44.289 
they can separate out into these nice

00:05:44.289 --> 00:05:47.040 
they can separate out into these nice
layers<00:05:44.849> then<00:05:45.849> you<00:05:46.060> just<00:05:46.240> do<00:05:46.330> it<00:05:46.449> one<00:05:46.659> layer<00:05:46.900> at

00:05:47.040 --> 00:05:47.050 
layers then you just do it one layer at

00:05:47.050 --> 00:05:48.899 
layers then you just do it one layer at
a<00:05:47.110> time<00:05:47.139> and<00:05:47.620> just<00:05:48.069> keep<00:05:48.250> making<00:05:48.580> sure<00:05:48.759> that

00:05:48.899 --> 00:05:48.909 
a time and just keep making sure that

00:05:48.909 --> 00:05:50.850 
a time and just keep making sure that
you<00:05:49.000> use<00:05:49.029> the<00:05:49.360> right<00:05:49.569> height<00:05:49.900> of<00:05:50.139> that<00:05:50.560> fluid

00:05:50.850 --> 00:05:50.860 
you use the right height of that fluid

00:05:50.860 --> 00:05:55.919 
you use the right height of that fluid
column<00:05:51.219> and<00:05:51.580> also<00:05:51.879> they're<00:05:52.060> right<00:05:52.919> density
