packaging now before we go into each

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:19.820 
packaging now before we go into each
turtle<00:01:18.390> each<00:01:18.540> one<00:01:18.810> does<00:01:19.020> come<00:01:19.320> on<00:01:19.470> with<00:01:19.799> a

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.100 
them clip on I would assume it's more

00:05:04.990 --> 00:05:07.110 
because his stealth accessory is a
loudspeaker<00:05:05.460> when<00:05:06.460> I<00:05:06.490> first<00:05:06.729> saw<00:05:06.880> it<00:05:06.910> in<00:05:07.060> the

00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:07.120 
loudspeaker when I first saw it in the

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:08.610 
loudspeaker when I first saw it in the
packaging<00:05:07.600> I<00:05:07.690> thought<00:05:07.900> this<00:05:08.020> was<00:05:08.169> just<00:05:08.440> some

00:05:08.610 --> 00:05:08.620 
packaging I thought this was just some

00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:11.249 
packaging I thought this was just some
sort<00:05:08.800> of<00:05:08.979> like<00:05:09.850> listening<00:05:10.389> device<00:05:10.660> but<00:05:10.960> no<00:05:11.080> it

00:05:11.249 --> 00:05:11.259 
sort of like listening device but no it

00:05:11.259 --> 00:05:13.439 
sort of like listening device but no it
goes<00:05:11.440> into<00:05:11.800> debt<00:05:12.550> on<00:05:12.699> the<00:05:12.729> bank<00:05:12.940> calls<00:05:13.150> like<00:05:13.330> a

00:05:13.439 --> 00:05:13.449 
goes into debt on the bank calls like a

00:05:13.449 --> 00:05:15.180 
goes into debt on the bank calls like a
voice<00:05:13.780> amplification<00:05:14.320> device<00:05:14.830> or<00:05:14.979> something

00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:15.190 
voice amplification device or something

00:05:15.190 --> 00:05:17.820 
voice amplification device or something
basically<00:05:15.460> a<00:05:15.580> loudspeaker<00:05:15.960> so<00:05:16.960> I<00:05:17.320> don't<00:05:17.650> see

00:05:17.820 --> 00:05:17.830 
basically a loudspeaker so I don't see

00:05:17.830 --> 00:05:20.370 
basically a loudspeaker so I don't see
why<00:05:18.009> you<00:05:18.070> would<00:05:18.310> give<00:05:18.490> the<00:05:18.729> silliest<00:05:19.389> honestly

00:05:20.370 --> 00:05:20.380 
why you would give the silliest honestly

00:05:20.380 --> 00:05:21.840 
why you would give the silliest honestly
