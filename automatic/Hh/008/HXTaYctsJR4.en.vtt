thing<00:02:05.640> going<00:02:05.969> on<00:02:06.119> I<00:02:06.469> definitely<00:02:07.970> when<00:02:08.970> I<00:02:09.000> first

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:09.330 
thing going on I definitely when I first

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:10.359 
thing going on I definitely when I first
went<00:02:09.569> and<00:02:09.660> got<00:02:09.780> this<00:02:09.929> dialed

00:02:10.359 --> 00:02:10.369 
went and got this dialed

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:12.699 
went and got this dialed
and<00:02:10.459> I<00:02:10.580> asked<00:02:11.090> for<00:02:11.750> a<00:02:11.810> hairdresser<00:02:12.319> to<00:02:12.440> make<00:02:12.560> my

00:02:12.699 --> 00:02:12.709 
and I asked for a hairdresser to make my

00:02:12.709 --> 00:02:15.309 
and I asked for a hairdresser to make my
hair<00:02:12.920> look<00:02:12.950> like<00:02:13.159> hers<00:02:13.640> and<00:02:14.030> it's<00:02:14.810> basically

00:02:15.309 --> 00:02:15.319 
hair look like hers and it's basically

00:02:15.319 --> 00:02:16.839 
hair look like hers and it's basically
I'm<00:02:15.650> I<00:02:15.769> think<00:02:15.950> hers<00:02:16.069> has<00:02:16.280> quite<00:02:16.489> a<00:02:16.549> bit<00:02:16.700> more

00:02:16.839 --> 00:02:16.849 
I'm I think hers has quite a bit more

00:02:16.849 --> 00:02:18.850 
I'm I think hers has quite a bit more
layers<00:02:17.060> though<00:02:17.390> but<00:02:17.989> that's<00:02:18.170> kind<00:02:18.470> of<00:02:18.560> what<00:02:18.830> I

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:18.860 
layers though but that's kind of what I

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:21.610 
layers though but that's kind of what I
was<00:02:19.099> going<00:02:19.340> for<00:02:19.489> so<00:02:20.239> yeah<00:02:21.080> that's<00:02:21.470> what<00:02:21.590> it

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:21.620 
was going for so yeah that's what it

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:22.930 
was going for so yeah that's what it
looks<00:02:21.830> like<00:02:21.980> a<00:02:22.040> really<00:02:22.310> long<00:02:22.519> hair<00:02:22.700> that<00:02:22.879> goes

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:22.940 
looks like a really long hair that goes

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:25.059

00:02:36.759 --> 00:02:36.769 
she does it she basically just like she

00:02:36.769 --> 00:02:38.259
