so<00:03:12.070> when<00:03:12.190> it's<00:03:12.340> all<00:03:12.460> set<00:03:12.670> up<00:03:12.790> you<00:03:12.820> can<00:03:13.090> have

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:13.210 
so when it's all set up you can have

00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:14.820 
so when it's all set up you can have
those<00:03:13.360> two<00:03:13.570> fingers<00:03:13.900> there<00:03:14.080> and<00:03:14.410> this<00:03:14.560> one<00:03:14.710> is

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:14.830 
those two fingers there and this one is

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:36.780 
those two fingers there and this one is
just<00:03:14.860> going<00:03:15.250> for<00:03:15.430> it<00:03:15.490> off<00:03:17.220> like<00:03:18.220> that

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:36.790 

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:40.330 

so<00:03:37.790> the<00:03:37.910> next<00:03:38.090> part<00:03:38.270> is<00:03:38.450> the<00:03:38.510> chords<00:03:39.220> chords<00:03:40.220> a

00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:40.340 
so the next part is the chords chords a

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:48.820 
so the next part is the chords chords a
minor<00:03:41.920> C<00:03:42.920> D<00:03:44.560> and<00:03:45.880> the<00:03:46.880> strum<00:03:47.210> is<00:03:47.390> just<00:03:47.720> now<00:03:48.530> my

00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:48.830 
minor C D and the strum is just now my

00:03:48.830 --> 00:04:01.160 
minor C D and the strum is just now my
hands<00:03:49.160> are<00:03:49.250> hurting

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:01.170 

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:03.420 

the<00:04:02.170> difference<00:04:02.530> is<00:04:02.709> that<00:04:02.739> you're<00:04:03.040> doing<00:04:03.190> it<00:04:03.400> a

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:03.430 
the difference is that you're doing it a

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:20.770 
the difference is that you're doing it a
little<00:04:03.580> bit<00:04:03.760> faster<00:04:04.209> so<00:04:04.360> you<00:04:04.660> go

00:04:20.770 --> 00:04:20.780 

00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:23.659 

cool<00:04:21.780> and<00:04:22.139> that's<00:04:22.260> the<00:04:22.470> whole<00:04:22.590> song<00:04:22.830> so<00:04:23.610> I'll

00:04:23.659 --> 00:04:23.669 
cool and that's the whole song so I'll

00:04:23.669 --> 00:04:48.590 
cool and that's the whole song so I'll
play<00:04:23.820> that<00:04:23.970> strumming<00:04:24.389> again

00:04:48.590 --> 00:04:48.600 

00:04:48.600 --> 00:05:38.970 

so<00:04:49.600> I<00:04:49.630> see<00:04:49.810> the<00:04:50.020> whole<00:04:50.170> thing<00:04:50.200> slowly<00:04:50.740> once

00:05:38.970 --> 00:05:38.980 

00:05:38.980 --> 00:05:41.380 

so<00:05:39.980> that<00:05:40.130> was<00:05:40.220> the<00:05:40.340> slow<00:05:40.460> version<00:05:40.730> once<00:05:41.300> you

00:05:41.380 --> 00:05:41.390 
so that was the slow version once you

00:05:41.390 --> 00:05:42.370 
so that was the slow version once you
get<00:05:41.510> it<00:05:41.600> up<00:05:41.690> to<00:05:41.840> speed

00:05:42.370 --> 00:05:42.380 
get it up to speed

00:05:42.380 --> 00:06:13.240 
get it up to speed
I<00:05:42.410> should<00:05:42.770> sound<00:05:43.010> a<00:05:43.070> bit<00:05:43.100> like<00:05:43.310> this

00:06:13.240 --> 00:06:13.250 

00:06:13.250 --> 00:06:52.300 

stop<00:06:21.169> stop

00:06:52.300 --> 00:06:52.310 

00:06:52.310 --> 00:06:56.480 

have<00:06:53.310> you<00:06:53.430> strumming<00:06:53.790> see<00:06:54.120> you<00:06:54.180> next<00:06:54.360> week
