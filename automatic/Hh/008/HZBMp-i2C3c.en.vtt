to your system or a VCR starting up our
controller<00:03:42.060> works<00:03:42.390> but<00:03:42.660> if<00:03:42.780> you<00:03:42.870> already<00:03:42.959> have

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:43.290 
controller works but if you already have

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:45.110 
controller works but if you already have
a<00:03:43.320> Genesis<00:03:43.830> I<00:03:43.980> think<00:03:44.489> you<00:03:44.700> know<00:03:44.880> how<00:03:45.060> the

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:45.120 
a Genesis I think you know how the

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:48.080 
a Genesis I think you know how the
controller<00:03:45.540> works<00:03:45.980> but<00:03:46.980> these<00:03:47.190> manuals<00:03:47.940> have

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:48.090 
controller works but these manuals have

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:51.260 
controller works but these manuals have
to<00:03:48.239> be<00:03:48.360> foolproof<00:03:49.850> so<00:03:50.850> here's<00:03:51.120> everything

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:51.270 
to be foolproof so here's everything

00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:54.740 
to be foolproof so here's everything
again<00:03:51.810> but<00:03:51.989> then<00:03:52.170> in<00:03:52.380> French<00:03:53.040> I<00:03:53.340> think<00:03:53.600> half<00:03:54.600> of

00:03:54.740 --> 00:03:54.750 
again but then in French I think half of

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:56.150 
again but then in French I think half of
the<00:03:54.840> Oh<00:03:54.870> half<00:03:55.230> of<00:03:55.380> the<00:03:55.470> but<00:03:55.650> half<00:03:55.980> of<00:03:56.070> the

00:03:56.150 --> 00:03:56.160 
the Oh half of the but half of the

00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:58.310 
the Oh half of the but half of the
booklet<00:03:56.340> is<00:03:56.550> French<00:03:56.820> half<00:03:57.030> but<00:03:57.209> if<00:03:57.330> half<00:03:57.930> of<00:03:58.170> it

00:03:58.310 --> 00:03:58.320 
booklet is French half but if half of it

00:03:58.320 --> 00:04:01.640 
booklet is French half but if half of it
is<00:03:58.560> English<00:03:59.459> so<00:04:00.390> this<00:04:00.600> is<00:04:00.720> either<00:04:00.870> a<00:04:00.989> Canadian

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:01.650 
is English so this is either a Canadian

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:03.530 
is English so this is either a Canadian
version<00:04:01.680> or<00:04:02.190> they<00:04:02.670> used<00:04:02.910> it<00:04:03.090> in<00:04:03.209> all<00:04:03.330> different

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:03.540 
version or they used it in all different

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:05.900 
version or they used it in all different
regions<00:04:04.320> so<00:04:05.070> they<00:04:05.190> could<00:04:05.340> sell<00:04:05.520> it<00:04:05.610> in<00:04:05.670> Canada

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:05.910 
regions so they could sell it in Canada

00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:08.240 
regions so they could sell it in Canada
