00:00:03.970 --> 00:00:10.320
 villa maxi dolphin e51 favor 15 meters long and 40 2 centimeters wide 4 meters 26 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:13.429
 but it only weighs ten tons 

00:00:13.429 --> 00:00:17.359
 this is the result of a construction based on experience 

00:00:17.359 --> 00:00:20.730
 in the production of furniture, performance will be just released 

00:00:21.279 --> 00:00:26.089
 unina stretched so contained for the mac installed the power reduced to two 

00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:31.710
 400 35 horsepower engines with the ks propulsion system of volvo ibs 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:34.710
 repent let's see what the results are 

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:39.960
 one of the fundamental characteristics of this type of propulsion la 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:43.109
 maneuverability grace joistyck that allows 

00:00:43.109 --> 00:00:45.680
 front I saw the boat be consoled 

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:48.280
 in a very simple way even if we are not 

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:50.370
 of the prophet sailors 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:54.350
 meanwhile, an important aspect is the drive for this much more effective production 

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:56.370
 than that of a line from you because it comes 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:59.430
 direct exactly parallel photo 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:02.370
 but what is the line of travel of the state 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:03.989
 designer wanted to give 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:09.130
 a racing angle this boat maybe slightly higher than what 

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:10.710
 we usually find on 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:14.320
 motor yacht opener of this size means that 

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:17.720
 we have to correct the outstanding character above all for bringing 

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:22.120
 breaded we have lowered it to the minimum of beautiful in this way 

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:25.710
 we manage to glide eh already skilled eighteenth century from 13 knots 

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:32.640
 2000 engine revs 17 knots speed this is an excellent result 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:33.289
 we have 

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:37.590
 a power that about half that of others normally do 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:41.270
 boats of this size and also the result is 

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:43.710
 definitely interesting 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:47.070
 not just in the hotel atrocities aspect. 

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:50.650
 but also and above all for what concerns di.uniba that with a power 

00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:54.000
 minor we naturally have apulia in force 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:58.380
 needing fuel right now we are consuming just 20 liters of 

00:01:58.380 --> 00:01:59.030
 diesel fuel 

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:01.560
 motor peroni 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:06.210
 of course it is a boat with this technology we like cowgirl also a 

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:07.320
 gait 

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:09.320
 we carry a little higher then 

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:13.939
 at 2000 400 minute turns when the engine curves indicating 

00:02:13.939 --> 00:02:17.760
 performance is a bit dynalite take that port viro judge 

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:19.269
 very important that 

00:02:19.269 --> 00:02:24.379
 consumption and results in terms of speed and then we test via 2000 

00:02:24.379 --> 00:02:29.319
 400 minute turns sailing at about 23 knots speed 

00:02:29.319 --> 00:02:30.740
 we have a consumption 

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:35.490
 overall seen sandals I repeat for a 50 feet 

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:38.209
 this very interesting result 

00:02:38.209 --> 00:02:41.700
 increasing the speed of the boats we have two different ways of 

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:44.500
 say obama we can hold the glans in position 

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:45.909
 that's enough - 

00:02:45.909 --> 00:02:49.879
 in this way the hull emerges from the stern bow we see the best 

00:02:49.879 --> 00:02:52.049
 minimum stability 20 

00:02:52.049 --> 00:02:53.040
 find the loves 

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:57.039
 give a couple of speed nodes we can earn instead 

00:02:57.039 --> 00:03:00.329
 completely done dog studies completely the best for 

00:03:01.169 --> 00:03:03.109
 in the latter case 

00:03:03.109 --> 00:03:04.330
 think of some 

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:07.460
 degree of vision especially near the test 

00:03:10.039 --> 00:03:13.829
 one of the important characteristics required of a boat is that 

00:03:13.829 --> 00:03:16.779
 which is naturally very maneuverable 

00:03:16.779 --> 00:03:19.299
 and then we see we know what 

00:03:19.299 --> 00:03:22.039
 this state is offered 

00:03:22.039 --> 00:03:24.699
 tattoo the heeling angle to which 

00:03:24.699 --> 00:03:28.400
 the boat is subjected to modest so I would say that 

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:32.250
 we have no worries having to keep the grid in balance but it is 

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:36.470
 sufficiently narrow and this is due not only to the hull brands 

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:41.479
 of the type of propulsion that we have libia s600 of volvo penta 

00:03:41.479 --> 00:03:43.859
 let's try to change course we see that 

00:03:43.859 --> 00:03:48.179
 as soon as the hull rotates with fear the hull changes its direction then 

00:03:48.179 --> 00:03:49.539
 also this tour 

00:03:49.539 --> 00:03:52.839
 a remarkable sense of security a governed firm that makes us feel 

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:57.209
 the boat in the hands is an object that we are not used to driving 

00:03:57.209 --> 00:04:01.489
 every day like the car and have this feeling of safety of 

00:04:01.489 --> 00:04:04.489
 maneuverability that really nice 

00:04:05.619 --> 00:04:08.949
 welcome the security in which we have tried these parts action 

00:04:08.949 --> 00:04:11.949
 now we wait to the maximum 

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:27.170
 play with the game switches of the platone describes in the best way 

00:04:27.169 --> 00:04:30.250
 possible is also a fun way to find out who we are 

00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:34.470
 really riders if we can find the best performance in ours 

00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:36.620
 boat that does not drive with so much 

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:39.080
 colgate with the steering wheel 

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:42.080
 . with the affection checker 

00:04:49.229 --> 00:04:53.319
 first take off that reacts promptly every variation of the many to many clubs 

00:04:53.319 --> 00:04:55.460
 metro vando winter 

00:04:55.460 --> 00:04:56.830
 their world is better 

00:04:56.830 --> 00:04:58.870
 best nation we've come to 

00:04:58.870 --> 00:05:04.169
 malnatt maximum engine speed 3300 mini at maximum speed 37 knots 

00:05:06.430 --> 00:05:07.750
 chronometer the hand. 

00:05:07.750 --> 00:05:11.059
 lol give you another indication of this boat 

00:05:11.059 --> 00:05:14.249
 let's start it off we start a suddenly telemachus 

00:05:18.319 --> 00:05:21.300
 6 seconds 10 knots 

00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:24.409
 15 knots of time 

00:05:24.409 --> 00:05:26.979
 20 knots 13 seconds 

00:05:26.979 --> 00:05:30.240
 25th night 16th century 

00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:33.319
 reads 30 knots in 20 seconds 

00:05:33.319 --> 00:05:36.189
 I agree we are not on the arrival grid 

00:05:36.189 --> 00:05:40.499
 a grand prix of formula 1 however this is an important indication 

00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:45.880
 we do not have the brakes the only tool we have to decide how to govern 

00:05:45.879 --> 00:05:49.409
 the boat. the rudder and the accelerator rotate 

00:05:49.409 --> 00:05:53.099
 try to imagine the unpleasant feeling that you would have in a car without 

00:05:53.099 --> 00:05:54.069
 brakes 

00:05:54.069 --> 00:05:58.830
 but the plague even without accelerator cutting recommended revenge 4 button 

00:05:58.830 --> 00:06:01.889
 a curve in speed the accelerator serves 

00:06:01.889 --> 00:06:03.050
 coffee is not there 

00:06:03.050 --> 00:06:06.050
 and therefore having a prompt cash response is very important 

00:06:20.639 --> 00:06:25.340
 maxi dolphin 51 pawar is not just a boat to give me 

00:06:25.340 --> 00:06:30.060
 unparalleled marchesale aesthetic qualities exceptional performance chi 

00:06:30.060 --> 00:06:34.389
 we realized connelly no stop surfing party 

00:06:34.389 --> 00:06:38.319
 with the whole experience gained from the construction site 

00:06:38.319 --> 00:06:42.999
 key realization you will remain sailing which made it possible to make fly-do engine 

00:06:42.999 --> 00:06:47.500
 where few horses pass it will keep sailing at high gaits of Caserta 

00:06:48.279 --> 00:06:52.129
 low fuel consumption, especially the one I like best 

00:06:52.129 --> 00:06:53.219
 utmost respect 

00:06:53.219 --> 00:06:54.639
 for the filming environment
