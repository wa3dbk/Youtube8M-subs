00:00:00.920 --> 00:00:05.420 

okay<00:00:01.920> this<00:00:02.220> is<00:00:03.230> the<00:00:04.230> wasabi<00:00:04.620> gardens<00:00:05.190> under

00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:05.430 
okay this is the wasabi gardens under

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:08.450 
okay this is the wasabi gardens under
the<00:00:06.049> lean-to<00:00:07.049> against<00:00:07.710> the<00:00:07.799> shed

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:08.460 
the lean-to against the shed

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:14.120 
the lean-to against the shed
I<00:00:09.050> think<00:00:10.050> it's<00:00:10.170> 75%<00:00:10.620> shade<00:00:11.460> cloth<00:00:11.809> and<00:00:13.130> things

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:14.130 
I think it's 75% shade cloth and things

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:17.090 
I think it's 75% shade cloth and things
are<00:00:14.690> flowering<00:00:15.690> right<00:00:15.870> now<00:00:16.080> so<00:00:16.500> I<00:00:16.529> figured<00:00:16.920> out

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:17.100 
are flowering right now so I figured out

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:18.410 
are flowering right now so I figured out
what<00:00:17.310> the<00:00:17.400> hell<00:00:17.550> I'll<00:00:17.670> let<00:00:17.820> him<00:00:17.910> go<00:00:18.240> ahead<00:00:18.300> and

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:18.420 
what the hell I'll let him go ahead and

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:23.660 
what the hell I'll let him go ahead and
do<00:00:18.570> whatever<00:00:18.720> they're<00:00:18.990> gonna<00:00:19.080> do<00:00:21.140> and<00:00:22.670> started

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:23.670 
do whatever they're gonna do and started

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:27.200 
do whatever they're gonna do and started
out<00:00:23.850> with<00:00:23.880> six<00:00:24.539> and<00:00:25.170> I<00:00:25.550> divided<00:00:26.550> a<00:00:26.640> couple<00:00:27.029> of

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:27.210 
out with six and I divided a couple of

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:30.710 
out with six and I divided a couple of
them<00:00:27.359> one<00:00:28.109> time<00:00:28.820> and<00:00:29.820> I<00:00:30.060> just<00:00:30.240> dumped<00:00:30.510> a<00:00:30.539> bunch

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:30.720 
them one time and I just dumped a bunch

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:33.020 
them one time and I just dumped a bunch
of<00:00:30.900> compost<00:00:31.439> in<00:00:31.679> right<00:00:32.160> there<00:00:32.430> so<00:00:32.460> that's<00:00:32.730> kind

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:33.030 
of compost in right there so that's kind

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:35.209 
of compost in right there so that's kind
of<00:00:33.120> covered<00:00:33.390> up<00:00:33.480> a<00:00:33.570> bunch<00:00:33.780> of<00:00:33.870> stuff<00:00:34.110> but<00:00:34.440> it

00:00:35.209 --> 00:00:35.219 
of covered up a bunch of stuff but it

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:36.920 
of covered up a bunch of stuff but it
seems<00:00:35.430> to<00:00:35.520> be<00:00:35.579> pretty<00:00:35.820> tough<00:00:36.180> as<00:00:36.600> long<00:00:36.750> as<00:00:36.870> the

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930 
seems to be pretty tough as long as the

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:41.270 
seems to be pretty tough as long as the
Sun<00:00:37.140> doesn't<00:00:37.410> get<00:00:37.620> on<00:00:37.800> it<00:00:38.180> and<00:00:39.980> if<00:00:40.980> that'll

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280 
Sun doesn't get on it and if that'll

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:44.650 
Sun doesn't get on it and if that'll
come<00:00:41.399> into<00:00:41.610> focus<00:00:42.079> that's<00:00:43.079> what<00:00:43.260> I<00:00:43.290> grow<00:00:43.590> it<00:00:43.739> in

00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:44.660 
come into focus that's what I grow it in

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:48.139 
come into focus that's what I grow it in
cedar<00:00:45.660> farms<00:00:46.200> compost<00:00:46.860> and<00:00:47.100> cheap<00:00:47.399> junk<00:00:47.789> from

the Frog farm that was a good dip

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:57.410 
the Frog farm that was a good dip
because<00:00:56.550> apparently<00:00:56.969> this<00:00:57.180> that's

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
because apparently this that's

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:59.510 
because apparently this that's
relatively<00:00:57.899> hard<00:00:58.199> to<00:00:58.350> grow<00:00:58.559> but<00:00:58.800> I<00:00:59.010> have<00:00:59.309> no

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:09.119 
sometimes it gets hit by the weather

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:10.580 
sometimes it gets hit by the weather
sometimes<00:01:09.630> it<00:01:09.840> does<00:01:09.990> looks<00:01:10.320> like<00:01:10.409> it's<00:01:10.500> doing

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
sometimes it does looks like it's doing

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:11.890 
sometimes it does looks like it's doing
pretty<00:01:10.650> good<00:01:10.920> not<00:01:11.070> looks<00:01:11.310> like<00:01:11.400> I<00:01:11.460> need<00:01:11.610> some

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049 
some more snail bait so I don't even

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:20.690 
some more snail bait so I don't even
know<00:01:16.229> how<00:01:16.380> many<00:01:16.530> plants<00:01:16.830> are<00:01:17.040> now<00:01:19.549> let's<00:01:20.549> see

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
know how many plants are now let's see

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:23.330 
know how many plants are now let's see
here's<00:01:20.909> some<00:01:20.970> flowers<00:01:21.740> will<00:01:22.740> it<00:01:22.830> focus<00:01:23.159> that

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
here's some flowers will it focus that

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:31.330 
here's some flowers will it focus that
close<00:01:24.560> think<00:01:25.560> so<00:01:26.060> maybe<00:01:27.060> the<00:01:27.270> closest

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:31.340 

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:33.220 

yeah

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:33.230 
yeah

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:35.410 
yeah
that<00:01:33.830> anyhow<00:01:34.190> little<00:01:34.790> clusters<00:01:35.270> of<00:01:35.300> white

00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:35.420 
that anyhow little clusters of white

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:37.330 
that anyhow little clusters of white
flowers<00:01:36.200> and<00:01:36.380> then<00:01:36.500> they<00:01:36.620> fall<00:01:36.890> off<00:01:37.100> and<00:01:37.280> it

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:37.340 
flowers and then they fall off and it

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:40.540 
flowers and then they fall off and it
looks<00:01:37.490> like<00:01:37.520> it's<00:01:37.730> gonna<00:01:37.820> make<00:01:38.060> a<00:01:38.090> seed<00:01:39.430> if<00:01:40.430> you

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:40.550 
looks like it's gonna make a seed if you

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:42.160 
looks like it's gonna make a seed if you
can<00:01:40.670> see<00:01:40.880> those<00:01:41.120> try<00:01:41.510> and<00:01:41.600> get<00:01:41.690> it<00:01:41.780> against<00:01:42.020> the

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:42.170 
can see those try and get it against the

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:46.450 
can see those try and get it against the
black<00:01:42.380> background<00:01:42.410> there<00:01:43.660> Center<00:01:45.250> and<00:01:46.250> he<00:01:46.340> has

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:46.460 
black background there Center and he has

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:48.250 
black background there Center and he has
a<00:01:46.580> little<00:01:46.670> fat<00:01:47.000> deal<00:01:47.240> on<00:01:47.450> the<00:01:47.570> end<00:01:47.720> of<00:01:47.840> the<00:01:47.930> stem

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:48.260 
a little fat deal on the end of the stem

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:49.860 
a little fat deal on the end of the stem
there<00:01:48.560> where<00:01:48.680> the<00:01:48.770> petals<00:01:49.130> used<00:01:49.370> to<00:01:49.520> be

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:49.870 
there where the petals used to be

00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:55.390 
there where the petals used to be
there's<00:01:50.870> some<00:01:51.110> more<00:01:52.570> and<00:01:54.160> let's<00:01:55.160> see<00:01:55.280> the
