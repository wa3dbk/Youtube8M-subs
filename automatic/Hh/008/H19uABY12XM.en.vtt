00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:23.039 
yeah so basically I'm testing out the

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:26.359 
yeah so basically I'm testing out the
let's<00:00:23.730> see<00:00:24.260> the<00:00:25.260> two<00:00:25.470> cloth<00:00:25.710> one<00:00:26.010> of<00:00:26.099> them<00:00:26.220> is

with<00:00:51.270> the<00:00:51.860> 32<00:00:52.860> attack<00:00:53.070> it<00:00:53.160> s<00:00:53.309> e<00:00:53.840> okay<00:00:54.840> 9<00:00:55.199> 1889<00:00:56.160> 20

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
with the 32 attack it s e okay 9 1889 20

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:01.119 
with the 32 attack it s e okay 9 1889 20
20<00:00:57.149> something<00:00:57.739> 20.7<00:00:59.120> I<00:01:00.120> can't<00:01:00.600> really<00:01:00.690> see

00:01:01.119 --> 00:01:01.129 
20 something 20.7 I can't really see

00:01:01.129 --> 00:01:02.810 
20 something 20.7 I can't really see
recording<00:01:02.129> it's<00:01:02.219> kind<00:01:02.370> of<00:01:02.399> pain<00:01:02.550> in<00:01:02.699> the<00:01:02.760> ass

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
recording it's kind of pain in the ass

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:05.630 
recording it's kind of pain in the ass
really<00:01:03.830> okay<00:01:04.830> but<00:01:04.860> I<00:01:04.979> remember<00:01:05.250> to<00:01:05.339> be<00:01:05.460> slow

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
really okay but I remember to be slow

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:08.510 
really okay but I remember to be slow
like<00:01:05.820> we<00:01:05.970> saw<00:01:06.090> it<00:01:06.180> is<00:01:06.270> kind<00:01:06.420> of<00:01:06.450> like<00:01:06.570> the<00:01:07.560> 50%

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
like we saw it is kind of like the 50%

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:10.399 
like we saw it is kind of like the 50%
is<00:01:08.729> a<00:01:08.760> little<00:01:09.299> better<00:01:09.479> I<00:01:09.750> think<00:01:09.990> I<00:01:10.140> guess<00:01:10.290> it's

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
is a little better I think I guess it's

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:11.630 
is a little better I think I guess it's
because<00:01:10.470> the<00:01:10.680> how<00:01:10.830> many<00:01:10.950> clock<00:01:11.070> you<00:01:11.220> have<00:01:11.250> but

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
because the how many clock you have but

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:14.030 
because the how many clock you have but
in<00:01:11.760> this<00:01:12.390> case<00:01:12.630> 15%<00:01:13.229> is<00:01:13.290> a<00:01:13.320> little<00:01:13.619> better<00:01:13.770> and

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040 
in this case 15% is a little better and

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:16.609 
in this case 15% is a little better and
then<00:01:14.939> therefore<00:01:15.330> I<00:01:15.540> am<00:01:15.869> going<00:01:16.259> to<00:01:16.380> transfer

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
then therefore I am going to transfer

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:20.719 
then therefore I am going to transfer
the<00:01:17.430> 50%<00:01:18.330> to<00:01:18.860> the<00:01:19.860> Phantom<00:01:20.189> and<00:01:20.220> gonna<00:01:20.490> keep

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
the 50% to the Phantom and gonna keep

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:25.850 
the 50% to the Phantom and gonna keep
the<00:01:20.939> 32<00:01:21.240> attack<00:01:21.479> here<00:01:22.020> and<00:01:22.290> yeah<00:01:23.280> so<00:01:24.740> so<00:01:25.740> the

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
the 32 attack here and yeah so so the

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:26.929 
the 32 attack here and yeah so so the
Reed<00:01:26.009> restocks<00:01:26.340> I<00:01:26.400> mean<00:01:26.520> it's<00:01:26.640> not<00:01:26.759> that

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:26.939 
Reed restocks I mean it's not that

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:28.310 
Reed restocks I mean it's not that
bigger<00:01:27.150> difference<00:01:27.479> like<00:01:27.659> I<00:01:27.750> have<00:01:27.930> out<00:01:28.110> or

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
bigger difference like I have out or

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:29.510 
bigger difference like I have out or
something<00:01:28.650> percent<00:01:28.829> lock<00:01:29.009> but<00:01:29.189> I<00:01:29.220> don't<00:01:29.430> have

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
something percent lock but I don't have

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:31.490 
something percent lock but I don't have
that<00:01:29.700> many<00:01:29.820> weapon<00:01:30.150> attack<00:01:30.390> to<00:01:30.540> be<00:01:30.630> honest<00:01:30.869> so

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.500 
that many weapon attack to be honest so

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:34.760 
that many weapon attack to be honest so
basically<00:01:31.950> is<00:01:32.520> both<00:01:32.850> like<00:01:33.060> 1k<00:01:33.450> better<00:01:33.659> 101<00:01:34.619> to

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770 
basically is both like 1k better 101 to

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:36.890 
basically is both like 1k better 101 to
2k<00:01:35.070> better<00:01:35.310> probably<00:01:35.909> my<00:01:36.150> this<00:01:36.509> is<00:01:36.630> just<00:01:36.810> from

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:36.900 
2k better probably my this is just from

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:38.780 
2k better probably my this is just from
like<00:01:37.110> too<00:01:37.320> many<00:01:37.439> testing<00:01:37.920> it<00:01:38.579> might<00:01:38.700> be

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:38.790 
like too many testing it might be

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:43.429 
like too many testing it might be
different<00:01:39.150> but<00:01:39.360> yeah<00:01:41.899> you<00:01:42.899> can<00:01:43.020> take<00:01:43.259> a<00:01:43.290> look

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:43.439 
different but yeah you can take a look

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:45.350 
different but yeah you can take a look
you<00:01:43.890> know<00:01:44.009> it<00:01:44.189> it's<00:01:44.729> kind<00:01:44.880> of<00:01:44.909> hard<00:01:45.119> to<00:01:45.149> like

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:45.360 
you know it it's kind of hard to like

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:46.609 
you know it it's kind of hard to like
follow<00:01:45.509> out<00:01:45.720> what<00:01:45.840> I'm<00:01:45.930> doing<00:01:45.960> because<00:01:46.320> this

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:46.619 
follow out what I'm doing because this

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:49.670 
follow out what I'm doing because this
recording<00:01:47.399> you<00:01:48.180> know<00:01:48.270> pretty<00:01:49.020> stupid<00:01:49.229> moving

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:49.680 
recording you know pretty stupid moving

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:51.950 
recording you know pretty stupid moving
my<00:01:49.740> mic<00:01:49.920> but<00:01:50.100> yeah<00:01:50.250> so<00:01:50.610> yes<00:01:50.850> and<00:01:51.000> see<00:01:51.210> its<00:01:51.780> kind
