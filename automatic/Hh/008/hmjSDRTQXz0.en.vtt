and<00:01:56.690> then<00:01:57.800> forwarded<00:01:58.800> to<00:01:58.979> me<00:01:59.160> and<00:01:59.430> then<00:01:59.670> I<00:01:59.940> have

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:00.210 
and then forwarded to me and then I have

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:04.520 
and then forwarded to me and then I have
to<00:02:00.390> make<00:02:00.600> them<00:02:00.840> but<00:02:02.000> there's<00:02:03.080> there's<00:02:04.080> so

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:04.530 
to make them but there's there's so

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:07.820 
to make them but there's there's so
there's<00:02:05.040> gray<00:02:05.729> area<00:02:06.150> there<00:02:06.380> that<00:02:07.380> is<00:02:07.560> where

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:07.830 
there's gray area there that is where

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:10.580 
there's gray area there that is where
the<00:02:08.070> magic<00:02:08.490> happens<00:02:08.940> because<00:02:09.209> each<00:02:09.660> store<00:02:10.320> is

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:10.590 
the magic happens because each store is

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:13.900 
the magic happens because each store is
different<00:02:10.950> and<00:02:11.580> each<00:02:12.000> different<00:02:12.780> space<00:02:13.440> and
