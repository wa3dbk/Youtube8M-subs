more<00:01:37.350> cinematic<00:01:37.829> storyline<00:01:38.520> lends<00:01:38.970> itself

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:39.299 
more cinematic storyline lends itself

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:41.600 
more cinematic storyline lends itself
better<00:01:39.420> to<00:01:39.780> film<00:01:40.020> than<00:01:40.229> the<00:01:40.320> original<00:01:40.770> once

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
better to film than the original once

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:43.190 
better to film than the original once
again<00:01:41.880> the<00:01:42.000> ending<00:01:42.329> is<00:01:42.450> punched<00:01:42.780> up<00:01:42.869> to<00:01:43.049> make

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
again the ending is punched up to make

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:44.719 
again the ending is punched up to make
it<00:01:43.320> more<00:01:43.439> exciting<00:01:43.740> as<00:01:44.100> the<00:01:44.280> battle<00:01:44.520> against

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:44.729 
it more exciting as the battle against

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:46.520 
it more exciting as the battle against
the<00:01:44.880> basilisk<00:01:45.420> is<00:01:45.570> much<00:01:45.780> longer<00:01:46.020> than<00:01:46.229> in<00:01:46.439> the

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.530 
the basilisk is much longer than in the

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:48.139 
the basilisk is much longer than in the
book<00:01:46.680> and<00:01:46.890> there's<00:01:47.490> better<00:01:47.729> use<00:01:47.939> of<00:01:47.970> the

00:01:48.139 --> 00:01:48.149 
book and there's better use of the

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:49.280 
book and there's better use of the
soundtrack<00:01:48.600> this<00:01:48.780> time<00:01:48.960> around<00:01:49.110> to

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:49.290 
soundtrack this time around to

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:52.280 
soundtrack this time around to
accentuate<00:01:49.619> the<00:01:49.950> action<00:01:50.310> scenes<00:01:50.899> the<00:01:51.899> acting

accentuate the action scenes the acting
is<00:01:52.439> once<00:01:52.619> again<00:01:52.740> good<00:01:52.950> and<00:01:53.369> the<00:01:53.759> special

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090 
is once again good and the special

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:55.580 
is once again good and the special
effects<00:01:54.360> continue<00:01:54.689> to<00:01:54.930> be<00:01:55.020> great<00:01:55.229> and<00:01:55.439> are

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:56.909 
used to better effect this time around

00:01:56.909 --> 00:01:59.810 
used to better effect this time around

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:09.690 
of Voldemort in the end it's not the

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:11.660 
of Voldemort in the end it's not the

but<00:02:13.980> at<00:02:14.280> least<00:02:14.430> I<00:02:14.610> can<00:02:14.640> say<00:02:14.940> it<00:02:15.150> is<00:02:15.270> improved

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:15.720 
but at least I can say it is improved

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:17.990 
but at least I can say it is improved
