played<00:04:19.180> a<00:04:19.889> 64-bit<00:04:20.889> video<00:04:21.340> game<00:04:21.609> in<00:04:21.880> home

00:04:22.379 --> 00:04:22.389 
played a 64-bit video game in home

00:04:22.389 --> 00:04:25.230 
played a 64-bit video game in home
systems<00:04:22.990> it<00:04:23.680> measures<00:04:24.370> what<00:04:24.550> it<00:04:24.580> does<00:04:24.850> is<00:04:25.090> the

00:04:25.230 --> 00:04:25.240 
systems it measures what it does is the

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:28.200 
systems it measures what it does is the
remote<00:04:25.510> control<00:04:26.520> measures<00:04:27.520> where<00:04:27.730> your<00:04:27.880> hand

00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:28.210 
remote control measures where your hand

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:30.659 
remote control measures where your hand
is<00:04:28.450> moving<00:04:28.630> to<00:04:29.320> play<00:04:29.560> the<00:04:29.710> game<00:04:29.919> so<00:04:30.130> instead<00:04:30.490> of

00:04:30.659 --> 00:04:30.669 
is moving to play the game so instead of

00:04:30.669 --> 00:04:33.810 
is moving to play the game so instead of
using<00:04:31.030> the<00:04:31.510> joystick<00:04:31.840> buttons<00:04:32.710> to<00:04:33.310> roll<00:04:33.610> the

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:33.820 
using the joystick buttons to roll the

00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:35.400 
using the joystick buttons to roll the
ball<00:04:33.850> you're<00:04:34.210> actually<00:04:34.480> gonna<00:04:34.600> swing<00:04:35.080> the

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:35.410 
ball you're actually gonna swing the

00:04:35.410 --> 00:04:38.400 
ball you're actually gonna swing the
remote<00:04:35.889> control<00:04:36.790> like<00:04:37.480> you're<00:04:37.690> bowling<00:04:38.200> it's

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:38.410 
remote control like you're bowling it's

00:04:38.410 --> 00:04:40.740 
remote control like you're bowling it's
much<00:04:38.889> more<00:04:39.190> interactive<00:04:39.550> now<00:04:40.300> I<00:04:40.360> know<00:04:40.480> that's

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:40.750 
much more interactive now I know that's

00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:43.050 
much more interactive now I know that's
gonna<00:04:40.930> be<00:04:40.990> hard<00:04:41.290> to<00:04:41.410> do<00:04:41.590> inside<00:04:42.160> a<00:04:42.220> car<00:04:42.550> but

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:43.060 
gonna be hard to do inside a car but

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:44.370 
gonna be hard to do inside a car but
that<00:04:43.090> you<00:04:43.450> doesn't<00:04:43.780> mean<00:04:43.870> you<00:04:43.930> can<00:04:44.110> only<00:04:44.139> play

00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:44.380 
that you doesn't mean you can only play

00:04:44.380 --> 00:04:45.780 
that you doesn't mean you can only play
games<00:04:44.590> in<00:04:44.800> the<00:04:44.860> car<00:04:45.040> you<00:04:45.190> could<00:04:45.310> actually<00:04:45.490> play

00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:45.790 
games in the car you could actually play

00:04:45.790 --> 00:04:47.670 
games in the car you could actually play
these<00:04:45.940> video<00:04:46.240> games<00:04:46.419> at<00:04:46.630> home<00:04:46.840> or<00:04:47.169> at<00:04:47.320> the<00:04:47.350> park

00:04:47.670 --> 00:04:47.680 
these video games at home or at the park

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:49.950 
these video games at home or at the park
wherever<00:04:48.130> you're<00:04:48.400> at<00:04:48.430> you<00:04:49.360> could<00:04:49.570> play<00:04:49.750> these

00:04:53.850 --> 00:04:53.860 
video games okay we showed you the video

00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:56.400 
video games okay we showed you the video
games<00:04:54.340> in<00:04:54.580> the<00:04:54.700> touchscreen<00:04:55.090> and<00:04:55.630> that<00:04:56.260> is

00:04:56.400 --> 00:04:56.410 
games in the touchscreen and that is

00:04:56.410 --> 00:04:58.890 
games in the touchscreen and that is
very<00:04:56.740> neat<00:04:57.310> functionality<00:04:58.240> this<00:04:58.419> is<00:04:58.570> like<00:04:58.750> I

00:04:58.890 --> 00:04:58.900 
very neat functionality this is like I

00:04:58.900 --> 00:05:01.290 
very neat functionality this is like I
said<00:04:59.110> cutting-edge<00:04:59.669> also<00:05:00.669> these<00:05:00.880> units

00:05:01.290 --> 00:05:01.300 
said cutting-edge also these units

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:04.500 
said cutting-edge also these units
include<00:05:01.750> audio<00:05:02.620> video<00:05:03.160> inputs<00:05:03.880> and<00:05:04.060> outputs

00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:04.510 
include audio video inputs and outputs

00:05:04.510 --> 00:05:06.840 
include audio video inputs and outputs
so<00:05:04.870> you<00:05:04.930> can<00:05:05.260> do<00:05:05.380> with<00:05:05.560> RCA<00:05:05.950> cables<00:05:06.430> you<00:05:06.580> could

00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:06.850 
so you can do with RCA cables you could

00:05:06.850 --> 00:05:09.600 
so you can do with RCA cables you could
connect<00:05:07.270> the<00:05:07.419> units<00:05:07.750> up<00:05:07.960> together<00:05:08.350> or<00:05:08.979> you

00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:09.610 
connect the units up together or you

00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:12.090 
connect the units up together or you
could<00:05:09.850> connect<00:05:10.330> them<00:05:10.690> to<00:05:11.140> an<00:05:11.260> outside<00:05:11.770> game

00:05:12.090 --> 00:05:12.100 
could connect them to an outside game

00:05:12.100 --> 00:05:14.520 
could connect them to an outside game
system<00:05:12.669> or<00:05:13.360> you<00:05:13.660> could<00:05:13.840> actually<00:05:13.990> use<00:05:14.290> them<00:05:14.440> as

00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:14.530 
system or you could actually use them as

00:05:14.530 --> 00:05:17.100 
system or you could actually use them as
like<00:05:14.680> a<00:05:14.710> photo<00:05:15.130> frame<00:05:15.720> you<00:05:16.720> could<00:05:16.840> do<00:05:16.960> all

00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:17.110 
like a photo frame you could do all

00:05:17.110 --> 00:05:20.159 
like a photo frame you could do all
kinds<00:05:17.139> of<00:05:17.470> things<00:05:17.710> but<00:05:18.100> this<00:05:18.630> Jack<00:05:19.630> makes<00:05:19.990> that

00:05:20.159 --> 00:05:20.169 
kinds of things but this Jack makes that

00:05:20.169 --> 00:05:23.010 
kinds of things but this Jack makes that
easy<00:05:20.410> to<00:05:20.620> connect<00:05:20.950> up<00:05:21.450> next<00:05:22.450> we<00:05:22.570> want<00:05:22.750> to<00:05:22.780> show
