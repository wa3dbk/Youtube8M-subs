I don't really know what that has to do

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:38.539 
I don't really know what that has to do
with<00:03:36.480> blood<00:03:36.720> pressure<00:03:36.959> but<00:03:37.370> obviously<00:03:38.370> the

with blood pressure but obviously the

00:03:38.549 --> 00:03:42.650 
with blood pressure but obviously the
doctor<00:03:38.790> thinks<00:03:39.090> it's<00:03:39.870> worth<00:03:40.110> checking<00:03:40.140> so<00:03:41.660> to

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:42.660 
doctor thinks it's worth checking so to

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:05.400 
that's how they do it but I rather never

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:06.650

00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:44.090 
the only reason I stopped eating is not

00:05:44.090 --> 00:05:45.400 
the only reason I stopped eating is not
pleased<00:05:44.360> as<00:05:44.450> I<00:05:44.510> feel<00:05:44.660> full<00:05:44.930> but<00:05:44.960> because<00:05:45.320> I

00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:45.410 
pleased as I feel full but because I

00:05:45.410 --> 00:05:47.350 
pleased as I feel full but because I

00:05:59.120 --> 00:06:02.020 
that'll mean that I don't have to be fat
Stacy<00:05:59.450> any<00:05:59.720> more<00:05:59.930> I'm<00:06:00.650> sure<00:06:01.040> opal<00:06:01.310> oof<00:06:01.490> Stacy

Stacy any more I'm sure opal oof Stacy

00:06:02.030 --> 00:06:05.530 
Stacy any more I'm sure opal oof Stacy
inside<00:06:02.630> my<00:06:02.810> head<00:06:03.020> for<00:06:03.560> a<00:06:04.030> lot<00:06:05.030> longer<00:06:05.180> and<00:06:05.450> I'll

00:06:05.530 --> 00:06:05.540 
inside my head for a lot longer and I'll

00:06:05.540 --> 00:06:08.290 
inside my head for a lot longer and I'll
be<00:06:05.630> Stacy<00:06:06.110> on<00:06:06.290> the<00:06:06.380> outside<00:06:06.770> but<00:06:07.730> I<00:06:07.820> think<00:06:08.060> I

00:06:08.290 --> 00:06:08.300 
be Stacy on the outside but I think I

00:06:08.300 --> 00:06:09.880 
be Stacy on the outside but I think I
don't<00:06:08.600> think<00:06:08.750> that<00:06:08.960> losing<00:06:09.350> weight<00:06:09.560> will

00:06:09.880 --> 00:06:09.890 
don't think that losing weight will

00:06:09.890 --> 00:06:12.780 
don't think that losing weight will
solve<00:06:10.190> my<00:06:10.460> issues<00:06:10.820> but<00:06:11.150> I<00:06:11.180> think<00:06:11.510> it<00:06:11.660> will<00:06:11.780> um<00:06:12.020> I

00:06:12.780 --> 00:06:12.790 
solve my issues but I think it will um I

00:06:12.790 --> 00:06:15.070 
solve my issues but I think it will um I
think<00:06:13.790> it<00:06:14.030> will<00:06:14.120> leave<00:06:14.300> room<00:06:14.570> for<00:06:14.600> me<00:06:14.810> to<00:06:14.930> focus

00:06:15.070 --> 00:06:15.080 
think it will leave room for me to focus

00:06:15.080 --> 00:06:17.170 
think it will leave room for me to focus
on<00:06:15.410> other<00:06:15.620> issues<00:06:15.800> issues<00:06:16.580> that<00:06:16.820> are<00:06:16.910> going<00:06:16.940> on

00:06:17.170 --> 00:06:17.180

on other issues issues that are going on
in<00:06:17.300> my<00:06:17.330> head<00:06:17.660> rather<00:06:18.320> than<00:06:18.590> right<00:06:19.370> now<00:06:19.400> I<00:06:19.610> can't

way

00:06:32.630 --> 00:06:36.220 
way
instead<00:06:32.990> of<00:06:33.430> considering<00:06:34.840> anything<00:06:35.840> else<00:06:36.020> and

00:06:36.220 --> 00:06:36.230 
instead of considering anything else and

00:06:36.230 --> 00:06:38.200

00:06:39.580 --> 00:06:39.590 
I can start dealing with everything else
