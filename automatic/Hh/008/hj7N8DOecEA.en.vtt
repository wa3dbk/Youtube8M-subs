without it now some people have thought
maybe<00:00:25.890> that<00:00:26.250> means<00:00:26.519> that<00:00:27.180> there<00:00:27.449> will<00:00:27.630> be

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:27.660 
maybe that means that there will be

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:31.460 
maybe that means that there will be
eventually<00:00:28.380> a<00:00:29.000> connect<00:00:30.000> less<00:00:30.420> xbox<00:00:31.230> one

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:35.820

kinect from the bundle then that would
be<00:02:41.650> a<00:02:41.800> 180<00:02:42.340> but<00:02:42.610> that<00:02:42.850> is<00:02:43.060> not<00:02:43.480> going<00:02:44.050> to<00:02:44.200> happen

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:44.500 
be a 180 but that is not going to happen

be a 180 but that is not going to happen
this<00:02:45.040> was<00:02:45.250> a<00:02:45.280> very<00:02:45.370> minor<00:02:45.880> policy<00:02:46.330> change<00:02:46.600> for

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:46.870 
this was a very minor policy change for

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:48.540 
this was a very minor policy change for
people<00:02:47.140> who<00:02:47.260> had<00:02:47.380> privacy<00:02:47.800> concerns<00:02:48.280> or

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:48.550 
people who had privacy concerns or

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:51.270 
people who had privacy concerns or
repair<00:02:49.420> issues<00:02:49.690> as<00:02:50.170> someone<00:02:50.830> stated<00:02:51.040> earlier

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:51.280 
repair issues as someone stated earlier

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:53.310 
repair issues as someone stated earlier
my<00:02:51.640> guess<00:02:51.880> is<00:02:52.180> that<00:02:52.210> very<00:02:52.690> few<00:02:52.870> people<00:02:53.020> will

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:53.320 
my guess is that very few people will

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:55.170 
my guess is that very few people will
take<00:02:53.470> advantage<00:02:53.530> of<00:02:54.130> this<00:02:54.250> feature<00:02:54.490> but

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:55.180 
take advantage of this feature but

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:58.040 
take advantage of this feature but
knowing<00:02:55.600> it's<00:02:55.840> there<00:02:55.930> as<00:02:56.410> an<00:02:56.920> option<00:02:57.160> is

00:02:58.040 --> 00:02:58.050 
knowing it's there as an option is

00:02:58.050 --> 00:03:01.500 
knowing it's there as an option is
important<00:02:59.050> so<00:02:59.830> for<00:03:00.310> those<00:03:00.790> who<00:03:01.210> may<00:03:01.450> be

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:01.510 
important so for those who may be

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:03.540 
important so for those who may be
thinking<00:03:02.020> that<00:03:02.440> we<00:03:02.740> might<00:03:02.770> hear<00:03:03.280> about<00:03:03.310> a

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:03.550 
thinking that we might hear about a

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:06.060 
thinking that we might hear about a
Kinect<00:03:04.090> less<00:03:04.300> version<00:03:04.870> of<00:03:05.050> xbox<00:03:05.590> coming<00:03:05.950> out

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:06.070 
Kinect less version of xbox coming out

00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:08.520 
Kinect less version of xbox coming out
soon<00:03:06.310> or<00:03:06.610> coming<00:03:07.090> out<00:03:07.180> at<00:03:07.390> the<00:03:07.480> same<00:03:07.690> time<00:03:07.990> that

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:08.530 
soon or coming out at the same time that

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:11.750 
soon or coming out at the same time that
xbox<00:03:08.950> one<00:03:09.130> is<00:03:09.250> released<00:03:09.610> at<00:03:10.180> this<00:03:10.840> point<00:03:11.140> today

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:14.980 
does not seem like that is very likely

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:16.590
