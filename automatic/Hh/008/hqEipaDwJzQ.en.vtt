00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:43.470 
honest with you as a character I think

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:44.630 
honest with you as a character I think
that<00:01:43.590> he<00:01:43.710> has<00:01:43.829> one<00:01:44.070> of<00:01:44.159> the<00:01:44.250> most<00:01:44.280> stale

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:44.640 
that he has one of the most stale

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:46.460 
that he has one of the most stale
characters<00:01:45.119> in<00:01:45.270> the<00:01:45.390> WWE<00:01:45.960> he's<00:01:46.290> not

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:46.470 
characters in the WWE he's not

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:48.200 
characters in the WWE he's not
undergoing<00:01:46.860> any<00:01:47.070> character<00:01:47.610> development<00:01:48.000> at

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:50.490 
all I mean it's at what is I guess his

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:52.039 
all I mean it's at what is I guess his
character<00:01:50.880> development<00:01:51.240> was<00:01:51.509> he<00:01:51.659> used<00:01:51.810> to<00:01:51.869> pop

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:52.049 
character development was he used to pop

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:54.469 
character development was he used to pop
up<00:01:52.079> from<00:01:52.380> underneath<00:01:52.649> the<00:01:53.090> stage<00:01:54.090> and<00:01:54.360> now<00:01:54.420> he

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:54.479 
up from underneath the stage and now he

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:56.389 
up from underneath the stage and now he
just<00:01:54.720> walks<00:01:54.930> out<00:01:55.140> and<00:01:55.320> the<00:01:55.470> the<00:01:55.680> pyro<00:01:55.950> goes<00:01:56.219> off

00:01:56.389 --> 00:01:56.399 
just walks out and the the pyro goes off

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:58.520
