00:02:33.339 --> 00:02:33.349 
run this might take a little bit and

00:02:33.349 --> 00:02:34.539 
run this might take a little bit and
it's<00:02:33.530> going<00:02:33.590> to<00:02:33.680> back<00:02:33.890> up<00:02:34.069> all<00:02:34.280> of<00:02:34.400> your

00:03:06.819 --> 00:03:06.829 
cleaned it earlier today before the demo

00:03:06.829 --> 00:03:08.800 
cleaned it earlier today before the demo
so<00:03:07.069> that's<00:03:07.220> why<00:03:07.400> it's<00:03:07.430> for<00:03:08.000> only<00:03:08.180> so<00:03:08.510> small

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:11.589 
so that's why it's for only so small
file<00:03:09.579> obviously<00:03:10.579> after<00:03:10.819> you<00:03:11.060> clean<00:03:11.269> the<00:03:11.390> catch

00:03:11.589 --> 00:03:11.599 
file obviously after you clean the catch

00:03:11.599 --> 00:03:14.589 
file obviously after you clean the catch
a<00:03:12.129> very<00:03:13.129> very<00:03:13.579> important<00:03:14.060> step<00:03:14.209> a<00:03:14.359> lot<00:03:14.510> of
