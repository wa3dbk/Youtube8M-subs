it<00:02:24.020> from<00:02:24.050> the<00:02:24.349> back<00:02:24.500> of<00:02:24.680> the<00:02:24.770> clocks<00:02:24.980> are

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:25.190 
it from the back of the clocks are

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:27.220 
it from the back of the clocks are
because<00:02:25.819> of<00:02:25.849> the<00:02:26.000> configuration<00:02:26.420> of<00:02:27.050> the

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:27.230 
because of the configuration of the

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:30.610 
because of the configuration of the
motors<00:02:27.910> or<00:02:28.910> the<00:02:29.480> air<00:02:29.600> saves<00:02:29.959> within<00:02:30.440> this

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:30.620 
motors or the air saves within this

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:34.300 
motors or the air saves within this
block<00:02:31.390> I'm<00:02:32.390> actually<00:02:32.750> wanting<00:02:33.290> to<00:02:33.860> fit<00:02:34.100> it

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:34.310 
block I'm actually wanting to fit it

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:39.720 
block I'm actually wanting to fit it
upside<00:02:34.760> down<00:02:35.230> so<00:02:36.230> that<00:02:36.260> motor<00:02:36.830> one<00:02:37.280> is<00:02:38.120> here

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:39.730 
upside down so that motor one is here

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:44.350 
upside down so that motor one is here
most<00:02:40.730> of<00:02:40.940> two<00:02:41.209> is<00:02:41.540> their<00:02:42.760> motor<00:02:43.760> three<00:02:44.180> is

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:44.360 
most of two is their motor three is

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:47.290 
most of two is their motor three is
there<00:02:44.660> and<00:02:45.290> four<00:02:45.860> is<00:02:46.040> there<00:02:46.340> because<00:02:47.090> that's

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:47.300 
there and four is there because that's

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:49.600 
there and four is there because that's
the<00:02:47.569> way<00:02:47.750> that<00:02:48.019> it's<00:02:48.200> set<00:02:48.470> out<00:02:48.530> on<00:02:48.920> the<00:02:49.069> kk

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:49.610 
the way that it's set out on the kk

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:51.759 
the way that it's set out on the kk
board<00:02:49.940> so<00:02:50.810> that's<00:02:50.930> going<00:02:51.200> to<00:02:51.260> make<00:02:51.380> more<00:02:51.560> life

00:02:51.759 --> 00:02:51.769 
board so that's going to make more life

00:02:51.769 --> 00:02:57.210 
board so that's going to make more life
nice<00:02:52.100> and<00:02:52.430> easy<00:02:53.200> so<00:02:54.200> I<00:02:54.230> intend<00:02:54.950> to<00:02:55.400> fit<00:02:56.390> this<00:02:56.660> on

back to using small ASA's it's very very

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:24.759 
back to using small ASA's it's very very
simple<00:03:22.280> to<00:03:22.549> do<00:03:22.880> and<00:03:23.290> just<00:03:24.290> gonna<00:03:24.440> run<00:03:24.650> the

simple to do and just gonna run the

00:03:24.769 --> 00:03:27.069 
simple to do and just gonna run the
three<00:03:25.010> wires<00:03:25.280> up<00:03:25.640> the<00:03:25.790> arms<00:03:26.030> coming<00:03:26.690> it<00:03:26.870> looks

00:03:27.069 --> 00:03:27.079 
three wires up the arms coming it looks

00:03:27.079 --> 00:03:29.229 
three wires up the arms coming it looks
like<00:03:27.290> it<00:03:27.470> was<00:03:27.590> almost<00:03:27.769> mine<00:03:28.190> for<00:03:28.549> the<00:03:28.760> any<00:03:28.910> cop

not<00:04:42.319> sure<00:04:42.349> what<00:04:42.800> the<00:04:42.949> white<00:04:43.159> saving<00:04:43.909> is

00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:51.560 

00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:54.340 

look<00:04:52.560> how<00:04:52.740> simple<00:04:53.370> that<00:04:53.550> is

00:04:54.340 --> 00:04:54.350 
look how simple that is

00:04:54.350 --> 00:04:57.950 
look how simple that is
one<00:04:55.350> of<00:04:55.500> those<00:04:55.680> wires<00:04:56.300> go<00:04:57.300> to<00:04:57.360> your<00:04:57.690> flight

00:04:57.950 --> 00:04:57.960 
one of those wires go to your flight

00:04:57.960 --> 00:05:03.440 
one of those wires go to your flight
controller<00:05:00.500> the<00:05:01.500> the<00:05:02.250> wire<00:05:02.520> there's<00:05:02.880> a<00:05:02.940> single

00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:03.450 
controller the the wire there's a single

00:05:03.450 --> 00:05:07.250 
controller the the wire there's a single
wire<00:05:03.660> in<00:05:03.990> these<00:05:04.230> and<00:05:05.360> only<00:05:06.360> one<00:05:06.630> of<00:05:06.810> them

00:05:07.250 --> 00:05:07.260 
wire in these and only one of them

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:10.430 
wire in these and only one of them
number<00:05:07.860> three<00:05:08.330> carries<00:05:09.330> the<00:05:09.600> power<00:05:09.840> to<00:05:10.230> your

00:05:10.430 --> 00:05:10.440 
number three carries the power to your

00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:15.740 
number three carries the power to your
own<00:05:10.680> flight<00:05:11.610> controller<00:05:13.730> so<00:05:14.730> one<00:05:15.030> seven<00:05:15.480> three

00:05:15.740 --> 00:05:15.750 
own flight controller so one seven three

00:05:15.750 --> 00:05:20.450 
own flight controller so one seven three
of<00:05:16.200> red<00:05:16.800> brown<00:05:17.610> and<00:05:18.030> yellow<00:05:18.540> and<00:05:18.990> the<00:05:19.890> signal

00:05:20.450 --> 00:05:20.460 
of red brown and yellow and the signal

00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:24.800 
of red brown and yellow and the signal
goes<00:05:20.700> to<00:05:20.940> the<00:05:21.240> right-hand<00:05:21.930> side<00:05:23.120> of<00:05:24.120> the<00:05:24.540> cake

00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:24.810 
goes to the right-hand side of the cake

00:05:24.810 --> 00:05:27.320 
goes to the right-hand side of the cake
a<00:05:25.020> board<00:05:25.320> from<00:05:26.190> that<00:05:26.490> that's<00:05:26.790> what<00:05:27.000> I'll<00:05:27.120> be

00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:27.330 
a board from that that's what I'll be

00:05:27.330 --> 00:05:31.490 
a board from that that's what I'll be
using<00:05:27.980> so<00:05:28.980> I'm<00:05:29.040> really<00:05:29.370> really<00:05:29.880> simple<00:05:30.510> not<00:05:31.320> as

00:05:31.490 --> 00:05:31.500 
using so I'm really really simple not as

00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:34.850 
using so I'm really really simple not as
many<00:05:31.770> wires<00:05:32.100> we're<00:05:33.030> going<00:05:33.180> to<00:05:33.240> pop<00:05:33.420> an<00:05:33.620> xt60<00:05:34.620> on
