00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:05.230
 hello good morning santi will be camps and I am 

00:00:02.870 --> 00:00:05.230
 of tele 

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:13.870
 Y 

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:18.800
 we have seen that you are the expert in 

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:21.259
 animals that means that it is also the 

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:24.230
 more strict jury good the truth that 

00:00:21.259 --> 00:00:26.539
 yes a little more especially on the subject 

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:30.110
 that there is no bad treatment and 

00:00:26.539 --> 00:00:32.360
 that the animal is working happily 

00:00:30.110 --> 00:00:34.550
 and it's the only thing I want because if a 

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:37.339
 animal happily works the show 

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:39.050
 Earn 80% and that's what I 'm 

00:00:37.339 --> 00:00:42.589
 playing for that can be a little more 

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:44.269
 district on the other topic but they have been 

00:00:42.589 --> 00:00:46.400
 everything is very strict with all that the 

00:00:44.269 --> 00:00:48.800
 goal is to have fun and you're 

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:50.809
 yes most of all is having fun the goal 

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:52.969
 but the biggest goal is that the 

00:00:50.809 --> 00:00:54.800
 people see that animals have to 

00:00:52.969 --> 00:00:57.320
 work well and there can not be wrong 

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:59.239
 treatment and for example if some 

00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:01.100
 animal stays let's say in white 

00:00:59.239 --> 00:01:03.449
 it happens to us there is some second 

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:07.270
 opportunity 

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:09.070
 behind the television when you see it not 

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:11.440
 there is a second chance because 

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:12.970
 when a current animal comes they know that 

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:15.960
 they have to go on a plate they have to 

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:18.119
 take a little bit prepared and can not 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:21.479
 to see a second chance if you do not 

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:23.010
 it could extend much time either 

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:24.659
 a funny anecdote that you can 

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:27.540
 tell that it happened that sure 

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:30.659
 There are many, there are many, I think that 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:33.420
 it's good that people see it because there 

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:35.310
 many pretty funny lines with the 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:37.259
 animals and especially in the then that 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:39.290
 they are touching the heart of 

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:41.430
 animals that are helping 

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:43.950
 owner and properties that have 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:47.250
 helped a lot the animal and you 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:48.869
 specialty is to the horses in that 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:52.020
 felt the horses the days as more 

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:55.560
 put the eye have come many here to 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:58.560
 program if the good because I am a 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:59.750
 little difficult to judge horses by 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:02.390
 what 

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:03.930
 I'm looking at the technique a lot and it's a 

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:06.980
 animal that 

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:09.860
 it's hard to work 

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:12.140
 within sites and that you are very happy and 

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:14.360
 is is a difficult animal because of that and because 

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:18.240
 I 'm pretty much judging that subject 

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:21.180
 because that 

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:23.520
 of a topic that I have experienced so much 

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:26.220
 of so many years because it has been difficult for me 

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:28.410
 judge it but I've put enough to all 

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:30.510
 the animals not only the horses but 

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:32.340
 to all the animals because I've worked 

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:35.220
 many animals at home my specialty 

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:37.320
 they are the horses but work 

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:40.680
 all kinds of animals for filming and 

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:42.990
 movies and shows and that and a little 

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:44.910
 I know them all but the 

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:46.680
 specialty are the cables so I 

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:48.980
 I have given a little more eye in the world 

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:48.980
