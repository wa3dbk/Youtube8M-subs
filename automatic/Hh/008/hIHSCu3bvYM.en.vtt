the song by ear what we're going to do
is<00:00:52.320> discuss<00:00:53.010> core<00:00:53.430> theory<00:00:53.730> and<00:00:53.940> apply<00:00:54.180> core

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
is discuss core theory and apply core

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:56.840 
is discuss core theory and apply core
theory<00:00:55.170> and<00:00:55.350> some<00:00:55.530> music<00:00:55.829> theory<00:00:56.100> into

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
theory and some music theory into

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:59.540 
theory and some music theory into
playing<00:00:57.449> by<00:00:57.600> ear<00:00:57.629> okay<00:00:58.440> so<00:00:58.500> this<00:00:58.739> is<00:00:58.920> where<00:00:59.280> we

one complete you started narrowing it
down<00:05:47.029> so<00:05:47.419> instead<00:05:47.779> of<00:05:47.839> having<00:05:48.020> 12<00:05:48.620> Keys<00:05:48.830> to

00:05:48.999 --> 00:05:49.009 
down so instead of having 12 Keys to

00:05:49.009 --> 00:05:50.320 
down so instead of having 12 Keys to
choose<00:05:49.219> from<00:05:49.430> you<00:05:49.759> get<00:05:49.909> you've<00:05:50.060> narrowed<00:05:50.240> it

00:05:58.089 --> 00:05:58.099 
you just by just figuring out what key

00:05:58.099 --> 00:06:00.610 
you just by just figuring out what key
it's<00:05:58.279> in<00:05:58.459> you've<00:05:59.060> taken<00:05:59.419> thousands<00:06:00.289> of<00:06:00.469> core

00:06:00.610 --> 00:06:00.620 
it's in you've taken thousands of core

knowing your chords and knowing your
core<00:06:47.680> theory<00:06:47.889> okay<00:06:48.520> so<00:06:48.940> let's<00:06:49.090> do<00:06:49.180> this<00:06:49.300> for

00:06:49.500 --> 00:06:49.510 
core theory okay so let's do this for

00:06:49.510 --> 00:06:52.080 
core theory okay so let's do this for
another<00:06:49.690> key<00:06:50.400> all<00:06:51.400> right<00:06:51.550> let's<00:06:51.790> say<00:06:51.910> we've

00:06:52.080 --> 00:06:52.090 
another key all right let's say we've

00:06:52.090 --> 00:06:55.379 
another key all right let's say we've
