00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:25.049 
what do you get quite a big support and

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:26.179 
what do you get quite a big support and
what<00:01:25.140> kind<00:01:25.350> of<00:01:25.380> attendance<00:01:25.830> is<00:01:25.950> to<00:01:26.070> get

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189 
what kind of attendance is to get

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:27.950 
what kind of attendance is to get
because<00:01:26.369> you<00:01:26.490> do<00:01:26.610> get<00:01:26.729> TV<00:01:27.090> coverage<00:01:27.330> down<00:01:27.750> yet

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960 
because you do get TV coverage down yet

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:30.380 
because you do get TV coverage down yet
yeah<00:01:28.439> it's<00:01:28.710> on<00:01:28.829> it's<00:01:29.280> on<00:01:29.400> Sky<00:01:29.640> Sports<00:01:29.670> each

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.390 
yeah it's on it's on Sky Sports each

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:32.240 
yeah it's on it's on Sky Sports each
week<00:01:30.720> and<00:01:30.960> I<00:01:31.350> think<00:01:31.770> last<00:01:31.890> year<00:01:32.040> the<00:01:32.159> average

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250 
week and I think last year the average

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:35.060 
week and I think last year the average
attendance<00:01:32.759> was<00:01:32.850> around<00:01:33.060> around<00:01:33.420> 300<00:01:34.020> but<00:01:34.259> it

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070 
attendance was around around 300 but it

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:37.190 
attendance was around around 300 but it
peaked<00:01:35.310> at<00:01:35.460> 500<00:01:36.000> for<00:01:36.540> Northern<00:01:36.750> Thunder<00:01:37.049> so

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
peaked at 500 for Northern Thunder so

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:38.780 
peaked at 500 for Northern Thunder so
we're<00:01:37.590> hoping<00:01:37.740> to<00:01:37.920> improve<00:01:38.280> that<00:01:38.460> this<00:01:38.640> year

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:38.790
