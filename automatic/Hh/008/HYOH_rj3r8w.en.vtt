00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:45.430 
things emerge and there's news emerges

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:47.160 
things emerge and there's news emerges
in<00:02:45.670> steadily<00:02:46.030> the<00:02:46.090> red<00:02:46.240> arrows<00:02:46.570> are<00:02:46.780> going<00:02:47.080> to

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:47.170 
in steadily the red arrows are going to

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:49.830 
in steadily the red arrows are going to
be<00:02:47.290> there<00:02:47.470> despite<00:02:47.800> all<00:02:47.980> speculation<00:02:48.730> we<00:02:49.630> are

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:49.840 
be there despite all speculation we are

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:51.540 
be there despite all speculation we are
having<00:02:50.020> the<00:02:50.230> red<00:02:50.410> arrows<00:02:50.800> they're<00:02:51.340> going<00:02:51.460> to

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:51.550 
having the red arrows they're going to

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:54.900 
having the red arrows they're going to
fly<00:02:51.700> over<00:02:51.730> some<00:02:52.450> sometime<00:02:52.960> shortly<00:02:53.820> near<00:02:54.820> the

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:54.910 
fly over some sometime shortly near the

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:57.840 
fly over some sometime shortly near the
beginning<00:02:55.030> of<00:02:55.270> the<00:02:55.360> ceremony<00:02:55.780> I<00:02:55.870> think<00:02:56.160> so<00:02:57.160> all

00:02:57.840 --> 00:02:57.850 
beginning of the ceremony I think so all

00:02:57.850 --> 00:02:59.100 
beginning of the ceremony I think so all
this<00:02:58.060> speculation<00:02:58.240> like<00:02:58.630> the<00:02:58.720> round<00:02:58.900> red

00:02:59.100 --> 00:02:59.110 
this speculation like the round red

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:01.050 
this speculation like the round red
hours<00:02:59.350> not<00:02:59.530> being<00:02:59.800> there<00:02:59.950> because<00:03:00.160> they<00:03:00.970> were

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:01.060 
hours not being there because they were

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:02.610 
hours not being there because they were
going<00:03:01.210> to<00:03:01.270> have<00:03:01.390> alien<00:03:01.690> spacecraft<00:03:02.290> or

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:02.620 
going to have alien spacecraft or

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:04.470 
going to have alien spacecraft or
Holograms<00:03:03.280> or<00:03:03.550> follow<00:03:03.880> the<00:03:03.910> fake<00:03:04.120> alien

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:04.480 
Holograms or follow the fake alien

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:08.190 
Holograms or follow the fake alien
spacecraft<00:03:04.990> is<00:03:05.350> not<00:03:05.620> true<00:03:06.000> not<00:03:07.000> that<00:03:07.210> simply

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:08.200 
spacecraft is not true not that simply

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:09.510 
spacecraft is not true not that simply
the<00:03:08.290> red<00:03:08.410> hours<00:03:08.680> being<00:03:08.920> there<00:03:09.160> means<00:03:09.310> there

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:09.520 
the red hours being there means there

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:11.550 
the red hours being there means there
won't<00:03:09.640> be<00:03:09.850> fake<00:03:10.090> alien<00:03:10.450> spacecraft<00:03:10.990> or<00:03:11.260> real

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:11.560 
won't be fake alien spacecraft or real

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:14.490 
won't be fake alien spacecraft or real
alien<00:03:11.920> spacecraft<00:03:12.490> it's<00:03:13.120> just<00:03:13.330> just<00:03:14.320> that

00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:14.500 
alien spacecraft it's just just that

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:18.180 
alien spacecraft it's just just that
particular<00:03:14.800> rumor<00:03:15.310> was<00:03:15.460> not<00:03:15.610> true<00:03:16.950> all<00:03:17.950> right

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:18.190

00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:22.780 
um well we've had this thing here this

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:24.510 
um well we've had this thing here this
boat<00:03:23.050> I<00:03:23.290> suspect<00:03:23.800> those<00:03:23.890> rollers<00:03:24.340> aren't

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:24.520

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:26.220 
boat I suspect those rollers aren't
really<00:03:24.820> pushing<00:03:25.209> it<00:03:25.300> you<00:03:25.360> know<00:03:25.540> i<00:03:25.720> just<00:03:25.780> i

think<00:03:26.860> it's<00:03:27.160> got<00:03:27.280> an<00:03:27.370> engine<00:03:27.550> and<00:03:27.880> the<00:03:27.970> rollers

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:28.270 
think it's got an engine and the rollers

00:03:28.270 --> 00:03:29.610 
think it's got an engine and the rollers
