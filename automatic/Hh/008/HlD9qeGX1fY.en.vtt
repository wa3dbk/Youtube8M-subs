I'm going to be showing you one of the

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:12.740 
I'm going to be showing you one of the
big<00:00:08.610> creations<00:00:09.120> a<00:00:09.269> day<00:00:10.340> so<00:00:11.340> me<00:00:12.269> a<00:00:12.300> couple<00:00:12.599> of

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:12.750 
big creations a day so me a couple of

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:15.110 
big creations a day so me a couple of
friends<00:00:12.960> been<00:00:13.200> working<00:00:13.650> on<00:00:13.769> in<00:00:14.040> digital<00:00:14.849> clock

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:15.120 
friends been working on in digital clock

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:19.099 
friends been working on in digital clock
that<00:00:15.150> tells<00:00:15.630> in<00:00:15.929> game<00:00:16.680> time<00:00:17.070> and<00:00:17.779> trust<00:00:18.779> me<00:00:18.840> is

00:00:19.099 --> 00:00:19.109 
that tells in game time and trust me is

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:20.810 
that tells in game time and trust me is
very<00:00:19.439> fun<00:00:19.650> playing<00:00:19.980> I<00:00:20.070> believe<00:00:20.340> it's<00:00:20.550> one<00:00:20.699> of

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:20.820 
very fun playing I believe it's one of

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:25.390 
very fun playing I believe it's one of
the<00:00:20.910> first<00:00:21.210> on<00:00:21.689> Xbox<00:00:22.529> has<00:00:22.859> been<00:00:23.070> replicas<00:00:24.050> so

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:25.400 
the first on Xbox has been replicas so

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:29.540 
the first on Xbox has been replicas so
yeah<00:00:26.660> if<00:00:27.660> you<00:00:27.779> want<00:00:27.960> a<00:00:28.109> better<00:00:28.560> view<00:00:28.769> of<00:00:29.279> to

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:29.550 
yeah if you want a better view of to

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:31.640 
yeah if you want a better view of to
come<00:00:29.730> up<00:00:29.849> here<00:00:30.170> rightly<00:00:31.170> it<00:00:31.260> took<00:00:31.439> us<00:00:31.560> about

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:31.650 
come up here rightly it took us about

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:34.370 
come up here rightly it took us about
three<00:00:31.800> days<00:00:32.550> to<00:00:32.610> make<00:00:33.059> this<00:00:33.360> and<00:00:33.809> to<00:00:34.079> make<00:00:34.200> sure

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:34.380 
three days to make this and to make sure

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:37.060 
three days to make this and to make sure
it<00:00:34.469> works<00:00:34.710> properly<00:00:35.149> it<00:00:36.149> tells<00:00:36.390> in-game<00:00:36.930> time

00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:37.070 
it works properly it tells in-game time

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:40.520 
it works properly it tells in-game time
hours<00:00:38.070> and<00:00:38.489> minutes<00:00:38.760> exhale<00:00:39.510> and<00:00:39.780> tells<00:00:40.170> you<00:00:40.350> a

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:40.530 
hours and minutes exhale and tells you a

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:42.680 
hours and minutes exhale and tells you a
more<00:00:40.800> pin<00:00:40.980> its<00:00:41.219> company<00:00:41.670> not<00:00:41.910> on<00:00:42.149> so<00:00:42.510> it's

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:42.690 
more pin its company not on so it's

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:46.520 
more pin its company not on so it's
stuck<00:00:43.290> like<00:00:43.620> that<00:00:44.360> yeah<00:00:45.360> so<00:00:45.899> if<00:00:46.200> you<00:00:46.289> want<00:00:46.469> to

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
stuck like that yeah so if you want to

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:49.069 
stuck like that yeah so if you want to
see<00:00:46.680> how<00:00:47.000> how<00:00:48.000> much<00:00:48.239> yet<00:00:48.570> to<00:00:48.690> do<00:00:48.840> for<00:00:49.020> the

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:49.079 
see how how much yet to do for the

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:51.319 
see how how much yet to do for the
written<00:00:49.410> once<00:00:49.710> it's<00:00:50.070> um<00:00:50.280> just<00:00:50.760> behind<00:00:51.059> here

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:51.329 
written once it's um just behind here

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:56.540 
written once it's um just behind here
and<00:00:51.660> it<00:00:52.320> is<00:00:52.469> very<00:00:52.620> complicated<00:00:53.579> so<00:00:53.969> I<00:00:55.399> might<00:00:56.399> be

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
and it is very complicated so I might be

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:58.670 
and it is very complicated so I might be
making<00:00:56.699> tutorial<00:00:57.629> on<00:00:57.719> it<00:00:57.870> but<00:00:58.050> I<00:00:58.109> might<00:00:58.379> not

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
making tutorial on it but I might not

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:03.110 
making tutorial on it but I might not
it's<00:00:59.010> very<00:00:59.190> complicated<00:00:59.640> as<00:01:00.000> you<00:01:00.030> consider<00:01:02.120> so

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
it's very complicated as you consider so

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:05.420 
it's very complicated as you consider so
I'm<00:01:03.420> gonna<00:01:03.989> briefly<00:01:04.589> explain<00:01:05.040> what

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430 
I'm gonna briefly explain what

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:10.310 
I'm gonna briefly explain what
everything<00:01:06.060> is<00:01:06.240> here<00:01:07.010> so<00:01:08.510> the<00:01:09.510> big<00:01:10.020> things

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
everything is here so the big things

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:13.580 
everything is here so the big things
that<00:01:10.470> you<00:01:10.680> see<00:01:10.860> here<00:01:11.100> our<00:01:11.400> memory<00:01:12.270> banks<00:01:12.590> these

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
that you see here our memory banks these

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:16.580 
that you see here our memory banks these
are<00:01:13.799> what<00:01:14.030> sends<00:01:15.030> signals<00:01:15.509> through<00:01:16.229> the<00:01:16.290> red

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
are what sends signals through the red

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:19.910 
are what sends signals through the red
zone<00:01:16.619> to<00:01:17.189> the<00:01:17.220> to<00:01:17.759> this<00:01:17.939> piston<00:01:18.630> which<00:01:19.049> changes

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
zone to the to this piston which changes

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:24.380 
zone to the to this piston which changes
in<00:01:20.070> numbers<00:01:20.490> domain<00:01:21.210> time<00:01:22.880> practically<00:01:23.880> the

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
in numbers domain time practically the

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:27.410 
in numbers domain time practically the
glass<00:01:24.830> the<00:01:25.830> resident<00:01:26.490> circuit<00:01:26.909> can't<00:01:27.119> trouble

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420 
glass the resident circuit can't trouble

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:29.929 
glass the resident circuit can't trouble
for<00:01:27.570> the<00:01:27.659> glass<00:01:27.869> and<00:01:28.369> control<00:01:29.369> for<00:01:29.579> the<00:01:29.670> blocks

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:29.939 
for the glass and control for the blocks

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:32.749 
for the glass and control for the blocks
so<00:01:30.600> you<00:01:30.659> have<00:01:31.049> to<00:01:31.200> place<00:01:31.770> the<00:01:32.340> block<00:01:32.549> from<00:01:32.700> the

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:32.759 
so you have to place the block from the

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:34.130 
so you have to place the block from the
glass<00:01:33.030> and<00:01:33.180> the<00:01:33.240> website<00:01:33.630> used<00:01:33.810> to<00:01:33.900> make<00:01:34.049> the

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140 
glass and the website used to make the

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:36.999 
glass and the website used to make the
right<00:01:34.320> numbers<00:01:34.740> which<00:01:35.070> took<00:01:35.310> a<00:01:35.520> long<00:01:35.970> time

00:01:36.999 --> 00:01:37.009 
right numbers which took a long time

00:01:37.009 --> 00:01:40.880 
right numbers which took a long time
there's<00:01:38.009> a<00:01:38.189> smaller<00:01:38.520> memory<00:01:39.210> bank<00:01:39.540> here<00:01:39.750> or<00:01:40.079> at

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890 
there's a smaller memory bank here or at

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:46.460 
there's a smaller memory bank here or at
this<00:01:42.320> the<00:01:43.320> smaller<00:01:43.619> memory<00:01:43.860> bank<00:01:44.189> here<00:01:44.460> and<00:01:45.470> on

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:46.470 
this the smaller memory bank here and on

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:48.889 
this the smaller memory bank here and on
each<00:01:46.829> end<00:01:47.100> and<00:01:47.340> this<00:01:47.549> bigger<00:01:47.790> ones<00:01:48.030> in<00:01:48.329> each<00:01:48.570> of

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:48.899 
each end and this bigger ones in each of

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:51.859 
each end and this bigger ones in each of
the<00:01:49.320> middle<00:01:49.740> so<00:01:50.490> probably<00:01:50.970> the<00:01:51.180> big<00:01:51.329> 12<00:01:51.600> for

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869 
the middle so probably the big 12 for

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:53.840 
the middle so probably the big 12 for
the<00:01:51.899> bigger<00:01:52.140> numbers<00:01:52.590> and<00:01:52.829> smaller<00:01:53.369> ones<00:01:53.610> for

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:53.850 
the bigger numbers and smaller ones for

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:58.100 
the bigger numbers and smaller ones for
the<00:01:53.939> less<00:01:54.180> big<00:01:55.110> in<00:01:55.259> the<00:01:55.380> birth<00:01:55.590> tol<00:01:56.159> me<00:01:56.189> so<00:01:56.909> I'm

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.110 
the less big in the birth tol me so I'm

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:03.380 
the less big in the birth tol me so I'm
yeah<00:01:59.010> the<00:01:59.880> red<00:02:00.060> stone<00:02:00.800> goes<00:02:01.800> a<00:02:01.830> long<00:02:02.340> way<00:02:02.670> and<00:02:03.000> a

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:03.390 
yeah the red stone goes a long way and a

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:08.139 
yeah the red stone goes a long way and a
little<00:02:03.630> tip<00:02:03.840> cop<00:02:04.530> slaps<00:02:05.750> um<00:02:06.800> one<00:02:07.800> more<00:02:07.830> time

00:02:08.139 --> 00:02:08.149 
little tip cop slaps um one more time

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:10.639 
little tip cop slaps um one more time
circuit<00:02:09.149> still<00:02:09.390> go<00:02:09.539> through<00:02:09.570> slabs<00:02:10.110> so<00:02:10.470> that's

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:10.649 
circuit still go through slabs so that's

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:14.210 
circuit still go through slabs so that's
helpful<00:02:11.600> so<00:02:12.600> yeah<00:02:12.810> as<00:02:13.140> you<00:02:13.620> can<00:02:13.710> see<00:02:13.890> it's<00:02:14.010> all

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:14.220 
helpful so yeah as you can see it's all

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:17.120 
helpful so yeah as you can see it's all

linked up to these Pistons via the red
Sun<00:02:17.310> circuits<00:02:17.970> and<00:02:18.270> Revere's<00:02:18.870> and<00:02:19.080> at<00:02:19.800> the

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:19.920 
Sun circuits and Revere's and at the

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:22.820 
Sun circuits and Revere's and at the
moment<00:02:20.780> there's<00:02:21.780> only<00:02:21.960> a<00:02:22.110> one<00:02:22.470> showing

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:22.830 
moment there's only a one showing

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:27.080 
moment there's only a one showing
because<00:02:24.080> these<00:02:25.080> distance<00:02:25.620> of<00:02:25.740> each<00:02:25.830> out<00:02:26.610> and

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:27.090 
because these distance of each out and

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:30.410 
because these distance of each out and
say<00:02:27.570> these<00:02:27.959> aren't<00:02:28.380> out<00:02:28.530> which<00:02:29.130> means<00:02:29.420> it's

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:30.420 
say these aren't out which means it's

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:34.970 
say these aren't out which means it's
going<00:02:30.570> to<00:02:30.690> show<00:02:30.900> a<00:02:31.250> 1<00:02:32.250> etc<00:02:32.580> for<00:02:33.209> the<00:02:33.270> rest<00:02:33.980> also

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:34.980 
going to show a 1 etc for the rest also

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:37.400 
going to show a 1 etc for the rest also
we've<00:02:35.310> added<00:02:35.730> this<00:02:36.300> little<00:02:36.360> dark<00:02:37.080> in<00:02:37.290> the

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:37.410 
we've added this little dark in the

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:38.810 
we've added this little dark in the
middle<00:02:37.650> that<00:02:37.680> you<00:02:37.860> have<00:02:38.100> in<00:02:38.220> a<00:02:38.250> digital<00:02:38.430> clock

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:38.820 
middle that you have in a digital clock

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:41.030 
middle that you have in a digital clock
which<00:02:39.270> pops<00:02:39.780> in<00:02:39.959> and<00:02:40.050> pops<00:02:40.290> out<00:02:40.560> which<00:02:40.860> is<00:02:40.890> a

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:41.040 
which pops in and pops out which is a

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:45.080 
which pops in and pops out which is a
very<00:02:41.280> nice<00:02:41.610> tool<00:02:42.620> so<00:02:43.620> yeah<00:02:43.890> I'm<00:02:44.760> just<00:02:44.940> gonna

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:45.090 
very nice tool so yeah I'm just gonna

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:47.660 
very nice tool so yeah I'm just gonna
start<00:02:45.480> your<00:02:45.600> but<00:02:46.350> I<00:02:46.620> won't<00:02:47.070> start<00:02:47.400> it<00:02:47.550> when

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:47.670 
start your but I won't start it when

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:49.640 
start your but I won't start it when
I've<00:02:47.820> got<00:02:48.000> to<00:02:48.390> make<00:02:48.540> it<00:02:48.570> like<00:02:48.840> the<00:02:49.170> right<00:02:49.380> time

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:49.650 
I've got to make it like the right time

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:52.160 
I've got to make it like the right time
just<00:02:50.070> to<00:02:50.160> show<00:02:50.340> an<00:02:50.400> example<00:02:50.730> if<00:02:51.540> I<00:02:51.720> wanted<00:02:52.020> to

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:52.170 
just to show an example if I wanted to

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:53.840 
just to show an example if I wanted to
start<00:02:52.350> utility<00:02:52.860> right<00:02:53.010> on<00:02:53.250> must<00:02:53.430> start<00:02:53.640> yet

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:53.850 
start utility right on must start yet

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:55.520 
start utility right on must start yet
know<00:02:54.120> at<00:02:54.420> the<00:02:54.570> time<00:02:54.600> that's<00:02:54.900> despite<00:02:55.230> on<00:02:55.380> there

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:55.530 
know at the time that's despite on there

00:02:55.530 --> 00:03:00.440 
know at the time that's despite on there
but<00:02:55.830> it<00:02:56.430> would<00:02:56.640> be<00:02:56.670> too<00:02:56.910> long<00:02:58.310> so<00:02:59.310> as<00:02:59.730> you<00:03:00.330> can

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:00.450 
but it would be too long so as you can

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:06.470 
but it would be too long so as you can
see<00:03:02.269> is<00:03:03.269> it<00:03:03.540> working<00:03:04.519> no<00:03:05.519> no<00:03:05.580> yeah<00:03:05.910> see<00:03:06.360> that's
