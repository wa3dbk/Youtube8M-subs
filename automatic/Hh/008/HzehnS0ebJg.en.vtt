penny-farthing but it was a number of
years<00:00:41.840> ago<00:00:41.960> so<00:00:42.200> what's<00:00:42.410> changed<00:00:42.620> over<00:00:43.370> the

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:43.430 
years ago so what's changed over the

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:45.910 
years ago so what's changed over the
years<00:00:43.700> well<00:00:44.570> forty<00:00:45.110> percent<00:00:45.440> of<00:00:45.680> children

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:52.790 
that can't cyber by that age and then

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:55.479 
that can't cyber by that age and then
continue<00:00:53.720> never<00:00:53.960> to<00:00:54.230> cycle<00:00:54.710> we<00:00:55.370> were

years<00:00:58.250> ago<00:00:58.489> in<00:00:59.450> Germany<00:01:00.079> and<00:01:00.399> this<00:01:01.399> is<00:01:01.579> the<00:01:01.700> way

00:01:01.810 --> 00:01:01.820 
years ago in Germany and this is the way

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:03.819 
years ago in Germany and this is the way
that<00:01:02.090> children<00:01:02.420> most<00:01:03.230> children<00:01:03.620> on<00:01:03.710> the

this<00:01:06.740> is<00:01:06.770> a<00:01:06.890> balance<00:01:07.250> bike<00:01:07.490> and<00:01:07.729> as<00:01:07.790> you<00:01:07.880> can

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:08.030 
this is a balance bike and as you can

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:09.849 
this is a balance bike and as you can
see<00:01:08.060> there<00:01:08.450> are<00:01:08.539> no<00:01:08.630> pedals<00:01:09.020> and<00:01:09.469> I<00:01:09.679> know

stabilizers<00:01:10.700> the<00:01:11.270> key<00:01:11.450> thing<00:01:11.479> about<00:01:11.719> that<00:01:12.049> is

00:01:12.279 --> 00:01:12.289 
stabilizers the key thing about that is

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:13.959 
stabilizers the key thing about that is
that<00:01:12.380> it<00:01:12.679> doesn't<00:01:12.950> need<00:01:13.069> clearance<00:01:13.639> for<00:01:13.939> the

feet up then they're starting to develop
that<00:02:39.580> sense<00:02:39.820> of<00:02:40.000> balance<00:02:41.280> it's<00:02:42.280> all<00:02:42.370> about

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:42.400 
that sense of balance it's all about

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:44.850 
that sense of balance it's all about
confidence<00:02:42.840> as<00:02:43.840> soon<00:02:44.140> as<00:02:44.290> the<00:02:44.440> kids<00:02:44.560> have<00:02:44.740> got

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:44.860 
confidence as soon as the kids have got

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:52.350 
accelerates dramatically high five high
five<00:02:50.310> so<00:02:51.310> how<00:02:51.459> do<00:02:51.520> they<00:02:51.610> make<00:02:51.760> the<00:02:51.880> transition

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:52.360 
five so how do they make the transition

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:53.940 
five so how do they make the transition
from<00:02:52.390> running<00:02:52.990> lifting<00:02:53.440> their<00:02:53.709> feet<00:02:53.920> to

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:53.950 
from running lifting their feet to

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:55.680 
from running lifting their feet to
actually<00:02:54.430> pushing<00:02:54.700> the<00:02:54.790> pedals<00:02:55.150> well<00:02:55.570> that

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:55.690 
actually pushing the pedals well that

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:58.020 
actually pushing the pedals well that
really<00:02:55.900> is<00:02:56.110> the<00:02:56.230> magic<00:02:56.530> moment<00:02:56.950> and<00:02:57.190> what<00:02:57.910> we

00:02:58.020 --> 00:02:58.030 
really is the magic moment and what we

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:00.360 
really is the magic moment and what we
find<00:02:58.270> is<00:02:58.510> it<00:02:58.690> through<00:02:58.959> the<00:02:59.080> course<00:02:59.320> and<00:02:59.620> then

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:00.370 
find is it through the course and then

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:02.160 
find is it through the course and then
developing<00:03:00.790> a<00:03:00.910> really<00:03:01.450> strong<00:03:01.690> sense<00:03:02.020> of

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:02.170 
developing a really strong sense of

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:04.890 
developing a really strong sense of
balance<00:03:02.400> the<00:03:03.400> pedaling<00:03:03.790> is<00:03:03.970> a<00:03:04.000> is<00:03:04.390> a<00:03:04.420> secondary

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:04.900 
balance the pedaling is a is a secondary

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:06.830 
balance the pedaling is a is a secondary
motion<00:03:05.320> really<00:03:05.709> and<00:03:05.920> as<00:03:06.010> you've<00:03:06.160> seen<00:03:06.340> today

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:06.840 
motion really and as you've seen today

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:09.930 
motion really and as you've seen today
peddling<00:03:07.840> comes<00:03:08.020> quite<00:03:08.230> naturally<00:03:08.790> would<00:03:09.790> you

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:09.940 
peddling comes quite naturally would you

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:13.050 
peddling comes quite naturally would you

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:14.750 

when<00:03:13.660> I<00:03:13.810> guess
