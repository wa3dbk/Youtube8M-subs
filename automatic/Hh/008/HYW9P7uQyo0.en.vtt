there's visceral fat now the
subcutaneous<00:00:35.250> fat<00:00:35.850> is<00:00:36.059> basically<00:00:36.870> the<00:00:37.110> fat<00:00:37.320> on

00:00:37.459 --> 00:00:37.469

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:40.440 
that outside it's over the muscle it's

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:41.840 
that outside it's over the muscle it's
right<00:00:40.649> under<00:00:40.950> the<00:00:41.070> skin<00:00:41.309> it's<00:00:41.520> the<00:00:41.610> stuff<00:00:41.820> that

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:41.850

you can see and hold onto causes the

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:45.229 
you can see and hold onto causes the
dimpling<00:00:43.980> in<00:00:44.129> the<00:00:44.219> cellulite<00:00:44.700> that's

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 
dimpling in the cellulite that's

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:48.049 
dimpling in the cellulite that's
actually<00:00:45.539> that<00:00:45.989> not<00:00:46.379> as<00:00:46.590> bad<00:00:46.950> fat<00:00:47.309> the<00:00:47.760> real

bad<00:00:48.300> one<00:00:48.480> is<00:00:48.660> the<00:00:48.809> visceral<00:00:49.200> fat<00:00:49.440> now<00:00:49.649> this<00:00:49.829> is

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:49.980 
bad one is the visceral fat now this is

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:51.979 
bad one is the visceral fat now this is
the<00:00:50.010> stuff<00:00:50.280> that's<00:00:50.430> inside<00:00:50.640> the<00:00:51.210> abdomen<00:00:51.390> it's

the stuff that's inside the abdomen it's
under<00:00:52.710> the<00:00:52.739> muscle<00:00:53.120> and<00:00:54.120> it<00:00:54.270> surrounds<00:00:54.480> the

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
under the muscle and it surrounds the

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:56.450 
under the muscle and it surrounds the
organs<00:00:55.379> and<00:00:55.590> actually<00:00:55.980> can<00:00:56.100> infiltrate

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
organs and actually can infiltrate

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:58.340

through the different organs and even
like<00:00:58.469> strangulate<00:00:59.010> the<00:00:59.129> heart<00:00:59.370> this<00:01:00.059> is<00:01:00.270> a<00:01:00.300> bad

like strangulate the heart this is a bad

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:02.119 
like strangulate the heart this is a bad
stuff<00:01:00.809> that<00:01:00.840> causes<00:01:01.199> an<00:01:01.559> increase<00:01:01.770> risk<00:01:01.890> for

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
stuff that causes an increase risk for

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:04.219 
stuff that causes an increase risk for
coronary<00:01:02.550> artery<00:01:02.969> disease<00:01:03.000> for<00:01:03.989> a<00:01:04.019> high

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 
coronary artery disease for a high

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:06.950 
coronary artery disease for a high
cholesterol<00:01:04.619> for<00:01:05.369> even<00:01:05.970> stroke<00:01:06.479> and<00:01:06.810> diabetes

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
cholesterol for even stroke and diabetes

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:09.350

and<00:01:07.470> even<00:01:07.500> sudden<00:01:07.979> death<00:01:08.220> so<00:01:08.729> that's<00:01:08.939> a<00:01:09.119> part

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
and even sudden death so that's a part

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:10.969 
and even sudden death so that's a part
that<00:01:09.479> we<00:01:09.570> want<00:01:09.780> people<00:01:09.990> to<00:01:10.140> be<00:01:10.260> decreasing

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979 
that we want people to be decreasing

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:13.640 
that we want people to be decreasing
watching<00:01:11.729> for<00:01:12.060> in<00:01:12.270> trying<00:01:13.049> to<00:01:13.140> eliminate<00:01:13.320> as

watching for in trying to eliminate as
much<00:01:13.830> as<00:01:14.010> I<00:01:14.100> can<00:01:14.159> now<00:01:14.939> the<00:01:15.000> irony<00:01:15.420> in<00:01:15.540> this<00:01:15.689> is

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869 
much as I can now the irony in this is

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:18.380 
much as I can now the irony in this is
that<00:01:16.049> as<00:01:16.650> most<00:01:16.950> of<00:01:17.100> us<00:01:17.250> will<00:01:17.400> focus<00:01:17.670> on<00:01:18.090> the

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
that as most of us will focus on the

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:21.200 
that as most of us will focus on the
cellulite<00:01:19.080> and<00:01:19.590> that<00:01:19.979> subcutaneous<00:01:20.369> fat<00:01:20.909> that

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
cellulite and that subcutaneous fat that

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:23.359 
cellulite and that subcutaneous fat that
we<00:01:21.330> worry<00:01:21.540> about<00:01:21.630> our<00:01:21.810> appearance<00:01:22.409> but<00:01:23.040> the

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:23.369 
we worry about our appearance but the

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:25.070 
we worry about our appearance but the
visceral<00:01:23.729> is<00:01:23.880> really<00:01:24.180> as<00:01:24.330> you<00:01:24.360> as<00:01:24.750> you<00:01:24.810> said

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 
visceral is really as you as you said

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:26.420 
visceral is really as you as you said
what<00:01:25.259> can<00:01:25.380> put<00:01:25.500> your<00:01:25.619> healthy<00:01:25.920> greatest<00:01:26.250> risk

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:26.430 
what can put your healthy greatest risk

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:27.710 
what can put your healthy greatest risk
how<00:01:26.549> do<00:01:26.610> you<00:01:26.759> know<00:01:26.850> that<00:01:27.030> you<00:01:27.150> have<00:01:27.299> visceral

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720 
how do you know that you have visceral

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:28.880 
how do you know that you have visceral
fat<00:01:27.869> because<00:01:28.049> that's<00:01:28.350> not<00:01:28.500> going<00:01:28.650> to<00:01:28.710> show<00:01:28.799> up

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
and the truth be told visceral fat can

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:42.620 
and the truth be told visceral fat can
happen<00:01:41.189> to<00:01:41.220> anybody<00:01:41.520> even<00:01:42.060> if<00:01:42.150> your<00:01:42.299> normal

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:42.630 
happen to anybody even if your normal

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:45.649 
happen to anybody even if your normal
weight<00:01:42.810> or<00:01:43.320> if<00:01:43.770> you're<00:01:43.920> even<00:01:43.950> underweight<00:01:44.820> and

weight or if you're even underweight and
you<00:01:45.840> since<00:01:46.200> you<00:01:46.259> can't<00:01:46.500> see<00:01:46.770> it<00:01:46.860> or<00:01:46.920> hold<00:01:47.070> on<00:01:47.280> to

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340 
you since you can't see it or hold on to

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:49.069 
you since you can't see it or hold on to
it<00:01:47.670> you<00:01:48.030> really<00:01:48.299> don't<00:01:48.479> even<00:01:48.600> know<00:01:48.840> if<00:01:48.960> you

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:49.079 
it you really don't even know if you

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:51.560 
it you really don't even know if you
have<00:01:49.320> it<00:01:49.500> unless<00:01:50.399> you<00:01:50.460> do<00:01:50.700> a<00:01:50.729> true<00:01:51.030> MRI<00:01:51.450> and

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:51.570 
have it unless you do a true MRI and

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:53.630 
have it unless you do a true MRI and
since<00:01:52.110> we<00:01:52.200> don't<00:01:52.320> typically<00:01:52.799> do<00:01:52.979> MRIs<00:01:53.399> on

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:53.640 
since we don't typically do MRIs on

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:55.190 
since we don't typically do MRIs on
people<00:01:53.970> it's<00:01:54.060> not<00:01:54.240> one<00:01:54.450> something<00:01:54.990> that<00:01:55.110> we

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200 
people it's not one something that we

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:56.929 
people it's not one something that we
standardly<00:01:55.680> do<00:01:55.829> so<00:01:56.280> the<00:01:56.430> best<00:01:56.579> thing<00:01:56.670> is<00:01:56.909> to

00:01:56.929 --> 00:01:56.939 
standardly do so the best thing is to

00:01:56.939 --> 00:01:59.510 
standardly do so the best thing is to
know<00:01:57.329> first<00:01:57.810> your<00:01:58.079> risk<00:01:58.320> and<00:01:58.649> then<00:01:59.100> how<00:01:59.490> to

00:01:59.510 --> 00:01:59.520 
know first your risk and then how to

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:01.219 
know first your risk and then how to
eliminate<00:01:59.909> it<00:02:00.240> or<00:02:00.420> decrease<00:02:00.810> it<00:02:00.960> the<00:02:01.049> best

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:01.229 
eliminate it or decrease it the best

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:03.230 
eliminate it or decrease it the best
that<00:02:01.290> you<00:02:01.409> possibly<00:02:01.530> can<00:02:02.189> so<00:02:02.790> that's<00:02:02.969> kind<00:02:03.180> of

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:03.240 
that you possibly can so that's kind of

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:04.940 
that you possibly can so that's kind of
what<00:02:03.390> you're<00:02:03.540> looking<00:02:03.570> for<00:02:04.110> what<00:02:04.649> are<00:02:04.740> some<00:02:04.770> of

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:04.950 
what you're looking for what are some of

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:06.109 
what you're looking for what are some of
the<00:02:05.040> things<00:02:05.070> that<00:02:05.280> put<00:02:05.460> you<00:02:05.579> at<00:02:05.670> risk<00:02:05.700> is<00:02:06.000> this

00:02:06.109 --> 00:02:06.119 
the things that put you at risk is this

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:07.850 
the things that put you at risk is this
like<00:02:06.540> so<00:02:06.689> many<00:02:06.840> things<00:02:06.899> genetics<00:02:07.590> could<00:02:07.740> that

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:07.860 
like so many things genetics could that

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:09.889 
like so many things genetics could that
be<00:02:07.979> a<00:02:08.009> factor<00:02:08.369> genetics<00:02:09.360> do<00:02:09.479> play<00:02:09.660> a<00:02:09.690> role<00:02:09.869> for

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:09.899 
be a factor genetics do play a role for

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:12.530 
be a factor genetics do play a role for
sure<00:02:10.200> the<00:02:11.039> people<00:02:11.190> that<00:02:11.489> have<00:02:11.730> that<00:02:12.000> the<00:02:12.209> apple

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:12.540 
sure the people that have that the apple

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:13.880 
sure the people that have that the apple
body<00:02:12.750> shape<00:02:12.989> is<00:02:13.110> called<00:02:13.170> an<00:02:13.379> anvil

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:13.890 
body shape is called an anvil

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:15.710 
body shape is called an anvil
little<00:02:14.069> shape<00:02:14.310> there<00:02:14.850> at<00:02:15.000> the<00:02:15.090> highest<00:02:15.330> risk

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:15.720 
little shape there at the highest risk

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:16.970 
little shape there at the highest risk
so<00:02:15.960> if<00:02:16.050> you've<00:02:16.170> ever<00:02:16.290> heard<00:02:16.500> anyone<00:02:16.740> say<00:02:16.950> I

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:16.980 
so if you've ever heard anyone say I

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:17.900 
so if you've ever heard anyone say I
don't<00:02:17.250> understand<00:02:17.550> I<00:02:17.610> have<00:02:17.640> these<00:02:17.819> little

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:17.910 
don't understand I have these little

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:19.520 
don't understand I have these little
chicken<00:02:18.330> legs<00:02:18.510> but<00:02:18.750> then<00:02:18.870> I<00:02:18.930> have<00:02:19.110> everything

chicken legs but then I have everything
here<00:02:19.920> that<00:02:20.490> should<00:02:20.790> put<00:02:20.880> up<00:02:21.000> a<00:02:21.060> red<00:02:21.240> flag<00:02:21.270> as<00:02:21.780> an

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:21.930 
here that should put up a red flag as an

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:23.870 
here that should put up a red flag as an
oh<00:02:22.080> I<00:02:22.500> bet<00:02:22.740> I<00:02:22.770> have<00:02:22.950> some<00:02:23.130> visceral<00:02:23.430> fat<00:02:23.580> going
