so<00:00:04.950> what<00:00:05.040> we're<00:00:05.130> going<00:00:05.220> to<00:00:05.310> make<00:00:05.540> now<00:00:06.540> is<00:00:06.960> a

00:00:07.519 --> 00:00:07.529 
so what we're going to make now is a

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:09.919 
so what we're going to make now is a
chocolate<00:00:08.280> mousse<00:00:09.210> in<00:00:09.450> the<00:00:09.510> shape<00:00:09.719> of<00:00:09.809> a

00:00:09.919 --> 00:00:09.929 
chocolate mousse in the shape of a

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:14.749 
chocolate mousse in the shape of a
walnut<00:00:10.139> on<00:00:10.740> a<00:00:10.940> warm<00:00:11.940> up<00:00:12.059> biscuit<00:00:12.440> base<00:00:13.759> to

00:00:14.749 --> 00:00:14.759 
walnut on a warm up biscuit base to

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:16.340 
walnut on a warm up biscuit base to
start<00:00:14.820> with<00:00:15.120> we're<00:00:15.389> going<00:00:15.480> to<00:00:15.990> show<00:00:16.139> you<00:00:16.170> how

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:16.350 
start with we're going to show you how

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:19.250 
start with we're going to show you how
to<00:00:16.410> make<00:00:16.680> a<00:00:16.710> silicone<00:00:17.580> mold<00:00:17.760> to<00:00:18.750> replicate<00:00:19.230> a

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:19.260 
to make a silicone mold to replicate a

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:22.759 
to make a silicone mold to replicate a
walnut<00:00:19.850> so<00:00:20.850> first<00:00:21.570> off<00:00:21.779> we<00:00:21.900> take<00:00:22.260> you<00:00:22.650> take

00:00:22.759 --> 00:00:22.769 
walnut so first off we take you take

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:25.279 
walnut so first off we take you take
some<00:00:22.949> Watts<00:00:23.689> we<00:00:24.689> just<00:00:24.869> need<00:00:24.990> to<00:00:25.080> make<00:00:25.230> sure

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:25.289 
some Watts we just need to make sure

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:26.900 
some Watts we just need to make sure
there's<00:00:25.619> no<00:00:25.710> holes<00:00:25.920> but<00:00:26.250> sometimes<00:00:26.609> a<00:00:26.730> walnut

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:26.910 
there's no holes but sometimes a walnut

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:28.519 
there's no holes but sometimes a walnut
can<00:00:27.150> have<00:00:27.269> little<00:00:27.660> holes<00:00:27.960> where<00:00:28.080> the<00:00:28.289> silicone

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:28.529 
can have little holes where the silicone

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:30.740 
can have little holes where the silicone
will<00:00:28.680> fall<00:00:28.920> through<00:00:29.160> it<00:00:29.310> so<00:00:29.910> I've<00:00:30.359> got<00:00:30.570> two

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:30.750 
will fall through it so I've got two

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:33.139 
will fall through it so I've got two
that<00:00:30.929> I've<00:00:31.019> selected<00:00:31.170> here<00:00:31.669> I'm<00:00:32.669> now<00:00:32.880> going<00:00:33.059> to

00:00:33.139 --> 00:00:33.149 
that I've selected here I'm now going to

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:36.290 
that I've selected here I'm now going to
fasten<00:00:33.630> them<00:00:33.930> into<00:00:34.350> a<00:00:34.380> into<00:00:34.800> a<00:00:34.980> plastic<00:00:35.910> tube

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:36.300 
fasten them into a into a plastic tube

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:39.709 
fasten them into a into a plastic tube
so<00:00:36.809> I'm<00:00:37.020> just<00:00:37.170> going<00:00:37.290> to<00:00:37.370> put<00:00:38.370> a<00:00:38.399> blob<00:00:38.730> of<00:00:38.910> hot

00:00:39.709 --> 00:00:39.719 
so I'm just going to put a blob of hot

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:43.490 
so I'm just going to put a blob of hot
glue<00:00:39.870> on<00:00:40.399> the<00:00:41.399> bottom<00:00:42.050> and<00:00:43.050> then<00:00:43.230> going<00:00:43.440> to

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:43.500 
glue on the bottom and then going to

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:46.750 
glue on the bottom and then going to
turn<00:00:43.829> this<00:00:43.950> over<00:00:44.129> and<00:00:44.489> place<00:00:45.210> inside<00:00:45.629> the

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:46.760 
turn this over and place inside the

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:49.310 
turn this over and place inside the
topper<00:00:47.760> where<00:00:47.969> so<00:00:48.660> I'm<00:00:48.750> going<00:00:48.870> to<00:00:48.899> put<00:00:49.050> two

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320 
topper where so I'm going to put two

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:51.709 
topper where so I'm going to put two
walnuts<00:00:49.920> into<00:00:50.160> this<00:00:50.250> one<00:00:50.430> mold<00:00:50.700> so<00:00:51.449> I'll<00:00:51.539> put

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719 
walnuts into this one mold so I'll put

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:56.510 
walnuts into this one mold so I'll put
the<00:00:51.870> hot<00:00:52.140> glue<00:00:52.820> same<00:00:53.820> as<00:00:53.969> the<00:00:54.059> first<00:00:54.239> one<00:00:55.520> place

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.520 
the hot glue same as the first one place

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:58.250 
the hot glue same as the first one place
it<00:00:56.670> inside<00:00:56.820> and<00:00:57.210> leave<00:00:57.300> a<00:00:57.360> slight<00:00:57.750> gap<00:00:58.020> between

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
it inside and leave a slight gap between

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:03.470 
it inside and leave a slight gap between
the<00:00:58.559> two<00:01:00.289> like<00:01:01.289> so<00:01:01.609> I'm<00:01:02.609> using<00:01:02.820> a<00:01:03.000> food<00:01:03.300> grade

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
the two like so I'm using a food grade

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:05.840 
the two like so I'm using a food grade
silicone<00:01:03.830> for<00:01:04.830> this<00:01:04.979> particular<00:01:05.280> mold<00:01:05.670> I'm

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850 
silicone for this particular mold I'm

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:08.090 
silicone for this particular mold I'm
going<00:01:06.030> to<00:01:06.090> need<00:01:06.210> about<00:01:06.420> 150<00:01:07.020> grams<00:01:07.439> so<00:01:07.979> I'm

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
going to need about 150 grams so I'm

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:10.219 
going to need about 150 grams so I'm
using<00:01:08.310> a<00:01:08.490> thirty<00:01:08.909> sure<00:01:09.180> here<00:01:09.479> sometimes<00:01:10.200> I

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229 
using a thirty sure here sometimes I

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:12.890 
using a thirty sure here sometimes I
might<00:01:10.320> use<00:01:10.470> twenty<00:01:10.970> so<00:01:11.970> we<00:01:12.090> have<00:01:12.210> the<00:01:12.299> liquid

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
might use twenty so we have the liquid

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:16.100 
might use twenty so we have the liquid
in<00:01:13.380> wanton<00:01:14.240> and<00:01:15.240> we<00:01:15.360> have<00:01:15.450> a<00:01:15.479> second<00:01:15.780> liquid<00:01:15.900> in

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
in wanton and we have a second liquid in

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:18.289 
in wanton and we have a second liquid in
another<00:01:16.350> ten<00:01:16.560> which<00:01:16.650> is<00:01:16.680> a<00:01:16.799> catalyst<00:01:17.310> so<00:01:18.180> we

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:18.299 
another ten which is a catalyst so we

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:19.940 
another ten which is a catalyst so we
add<00:01:18.420> a<00:01:18.450> small<00:01:18.689> percentage<00:01:19.259> of<00:01:19.350> catalyst<00:01:19.799> to

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 
add a small percentage of catalyst to

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:22.010 
add a small percentage of catalyst to
the<00:01:19.979> silicon<00:01:20.460> which<00:01:20.970> will<00:01:21.119> help<00:01:21.210> it<00:01:21.360> secure<00:01:21.750> so

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
the silicon which will help it secure so

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:24.920 
the silicon which will help it secure so
this<00:01:22.500> is<00:01:22.590> about<00:01:22.770> six<00:01:23.070> our<00:01:23.220> cure<00:01:23.520> time<00:01:23.759> so<00:01:24.750> in

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930 
this is about six our cure time so in

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:27.649 
this is about six our cure time so in
the<00:01:25.020> zero<00:01:25.229> the<00:01:25.350> scales<00:01:26.390> and<00:01:27.390> we're<00:01:27.570> gonna

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:27.659 
the zero the scales and we're gonna

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:29.990 
the zero the scales and we're gonna
weigh<00:01:27.930> in<00:01:28.110> their<00:01:28.520> way<00:01:29.520> a<00:01:29.549> little<00:01:29.670> bit<00:01:29.790> more

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
weigh in their way a little bit more

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:35.210 
weigh in their way a little bit more
than<00:01:30.119> I<00:01:30.150> need<00:01:30.390> so<00:01:31.009> that's<00:01:32.299> 190<00:01:33.299> grams<00:01:33.979> so<00:01:34.979> I'm

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:35.220 
than I need so that's 190 grams so I'm

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:38.539 
than I need so that's 190 grams so I'm
going<00:01:35.369> to<00:01:35.430> add<00:01:35.610> 10<00:01:36.119> percent<00:01:36.770> catalyst<00:01:37.770> to<00:01:38.430> this

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:38.549 
going to add 10 percent catalyst to this

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:41.480 
going to add 10 percent catalyst to this
so<00:01:38.880> it's<00:01:39.030> 19<00:01:39.360> grams<00:01:39.630> of<00:01:39.869> catalyst<00:01:40.320> and<00:01:41.280> that's

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
so it's 19 grams of catalyst and that's

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:45.200 
so it's 19 grams of catalyst and that's
just<00:01:41.640> pushed<00:01:41.850> straight<00:01:42.299> on<00:01:42.570> top<00:01:43.310> okay<00:01:44.310> so

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210 
just pushed straight on top okay so

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:48.649 
just pushed straight on top okay so
that's<00:01:45.360> 19<00:01:45.810> grams<00:01:46.110> of<00:01:46.860> the<00:01:47.009> catalyst<00:01:47.490> so<00:01:48.479> once

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:48.659 
that's 19 grams of the catalyst so once

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:50.300 
that's 19 grams of the catalyst so once
that's<00:01:48.810> mixed<00:01:49.020> through<00:01:49.290> we're<00:01:49.890> going<00:01:50.009> to<00:01:50.070> pour

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.310 
that's mixed through we're going to pour

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:52.429 
that's mixed through we're going to pour
now<00:01:51.030> as<00:01:51.210> I<00:01:51.240> start<00:01:51.450> support<00:01:51.810> I'm<00:01:51.990> not<00:01:52.170> going<00:01:52.320> to

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:52.439 
now as I start support I'm not going to

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:53.719 
now as I start support I'm not going to
touch<00:01:52.619> the<00:01:52.860> walnut<00:01:53.159> I'm<00:01:53.250> going<00:01:53.399> to<00:01:53.460> go<00:01:53.549> from

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:53.729 
touch the walnut I'm going to go from

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:55.310 
touch the walnut I'm going to go from
the<00:01:53.820> bottom<00:01:53.970> upwards<00:01:54.270> so<00:01:54.899> I'm<00:01:54.960> going<00:01:55.079> to<00:01:55.140> pour

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:55.320 
the bottom upwards so I'm going to pour

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:57.859 
the bottom upwards so I'm going to pour
it<00:01:55.409> down<00:01:55.500> into<00:01:55.680> the<00:01:55.799> corner<00:01:56.189> and<00:01:56.540> I<00:01:57.540> point<00:01:57.750> for

00:01:57.859 --> 00:01:57.869 
it down into the corner and I point for

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:00.679 
it down into the corner and I point for
my<00:01:57.960> height<00:01:58.200> so<00:01:59.070> it<00:01:59.130> creates<00:01:59.430> a<00:01:59.520> stream<00:01:59.880> of

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:00.689 
my height so it creates a stream of

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:02.060 
my height so it creates a stream of
silicone

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:02.070 
silicone

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:05.760 
silicone
it's<00:02:03.070> quite<00:02:03.310> fluid<00:02:03.700> so<00:02:03.850> it<00:02:03.970> will<00:02:04.409> flow<00:02:05.409> around

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:05.770 
it's quite fluid so it will flow around

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:07.440 
it's quite fluid so it will flow around
the<00:02:05.950> warm-up<00:02:06.280> from<00:02:06.430> the<00:02:06.520> bottom<00:02:06.820> upwards<00:02:06.970> if<00:02:07.360> I

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:07.450 
the warm-up from the bottom upwards if I

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:10.760 
the warm-up from the bottom upwards if I
keep<00:02:07.659> going<00:02:07.750> to<00:02:07.930> the<00:02:08.020> same<00:02:08.200> place<00:02:09.000> so

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:10.770 
keep going to the same place so

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:12.570 
keep going to the same place so
depending<00:02:11.770> on<00:02:11.830> the<00:02:11.890> silicon<00:02:12.250> you<00:02:12.340> use

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:12.580 
depending on the silicon you use

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:13.920 
depending on the silicon you use
depending<00:02:13.030> on<00:02:13.060> the<00:02:13.270> amount<00:02:13.420> of<00:02:13.510> catalyst

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:13.930 
depending on the amount of catalyst

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:15.870 
depending on the amount of catalyst
you've<00:02:14.110> used<00:02:14.349> I've<00:02:14.650> you<00:02:14.890> are<00:02:15.099> used<00:02:15.280> ten

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:15.880 
you've used I've you are used ten

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:17.970 
you've used I've you are used ten
percent<00:02:16.180> this<00:02:17.110> is<00:02:17.230> going<00:02:17.380> to<00:02:17.440> take<00:02:17.590> about<00:02:17.860> six

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:17.980 
percent this is going to take about six

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:19.830 
percent this is going to take about six
hours<00:02:18.340> so<00:02:18.970> we<00:02:19.090> can<00:02:19.120> just<00:02:19.390> use<00:02:19.480> a<00:02:19.510> pallet<00:02:19.690> knife

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:19.840 
hours so we can just use a pallet knife

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:22.740 
hours so we can just use a pallet knife
just<00:02:20.800> to<00:02:20.890> down<00:02:21.099> this<00:02:21.250> around<00:02:21.580> the<00:02:21.670> side<00:02:21.910> just

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:22.750 
just to down this around the side just

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:26.970 
just to down this around the side just
to<00:02:22.900> coax<00:02:23.170> it<00:02:23.349> out<00:02:24.180> there<00:02:25.180> we<00:02:25.300> go<00:02:25.769> and<00:02:26.769> we<00:02:26.890> want

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:26.980 
to coax it out there we go and we want

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:30.449 
to coax it out there we go and we want
to<00:02:27.160> cut<00:02:27.430> four<00:02:27.970> lines<00:02:28.950> following<00:02:29.950> the<00:02:30.099> shape<00:02:30.310> of

00:02:30.449 --> 00:02:30.459 
to cut four lines following the shape of

00:02:30.459 --> 00:02:32.490 
to cut four lines following the shape of
the<00:02:30.580> walnut<00:02:30.910> this<00:02:31.540> will<00:02:31.720> help<00:02:31.930> it<00:02:32.110> to<00:02:32.230> release

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:32.500 
the walnut this will help it to release

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:42.360 
the walnut this will help it to release
and<00:02:32.709> to<00:02:32.800> come<00:02:32.950> away<00:02:38.280> these<00:02:39.280> out<00:02:39.819> so<00:02:41.310> this<00:02:42.310> is

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:42.370 
and to come away these out so this is

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:44.309 
and to come away these out so this is
now<00:02:42.670> we'll<00:02:43.150> put<00:02:43.299> on<00:02:43.420> one<00:02:43.510> side<00:02:43.750> and<00:02:44.080> this<00:02:44.170> is

00:02:44.309 --> 00:02:44.319 
now we'll put on one side and this is

00:02:44.319 --> 00:02:45.840 
now we'll put on one side and this is
ready<00:02:44.500> now<00:02:44.560> to<00:02:44.709> fill<00:02:45.130> with<00:02:45.310> a<00:02:45.370> chocolate

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:45.850 
ready now to fill with a chocolate

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:47.070 
ready now to fill with a chocolate
mousse<00:02:46.120> I'll<00:02:46.510> show<00:02:46.690> you<00:02:46.750> how<00:02:46.900> we're<00:02:47.019> gonna

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:47.080 
mousse I'll show you how we're gonna

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:48.600 
mousse I'll show you how we're gonna
make<00:02:47.260> the<00:02:47.350> chocolate<00:02:47.620> mousse<00:02:47.709> so<00:02:48.370> we're<00:02:48.519> going

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:48.610 
make the chocolate mousse so we're going

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:51.000 
make the chocolate mousse so we're going
to<00:02:48.670> start<00:02:48.880> by<00:02:49.030> making<00:02:49.180> a<00:02:49.450> ganache<00:02:49.840> which<00:02:50.769> is

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:51.010 
to start by making a ganache which is

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:52.710 
to start by making a ganache which is
again<00:02:51.459> a<00:02:51.489> tempered<00:02:51.970> ganache<00:02:52.239> so<00:02:52.390> we've<00:02:52.540> got

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:52.720 
again a tempered ganache so we've got

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:56.070 
again a tempered ganache so we've got
tempered<00:02:53.140> milk<00:02:53.799> chocolate<00:02:54.840> and<00:02:55.840> we're<00:02:55.959> going

00:02:56.070 --> 00:02:56.080 
tempered milk chocolate and we're going

00:02:56.080 --> 00:03:00.080 
tempered milk chocolate and we're going
to<00:02:56.110> pour<00:02:56.290> in<00:02:57.600> the<00:02:58.600> same<00:02:58.840> temperature<00:02:59.170> cream

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:00.090 
to pour in the same temperature cream

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:02.339 
to pour in the same temperature cream
that<00:03:01.090> goes<00:03:01.120> in<00:03:01.420> and<00:03:01.599> we<00:03:01.660> need<00:03:02.019> to<00:03:02.140> stir

00:03:02.339 --> 00:03:02.349 
that goes in and we need to stir

00:03:02.349 --> 00:03:04.860 
that goes in and we need to stir
straightaway<00:03:03.120> and<00:03:04.120> we<00:03:04.239> create<00:03:04.480> an<00:03:04.540> emotion

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:04.870 
straightaway and we create an emotion

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:08.630 
straightaway and we create an emotion
between<00:03:04.959> the<00:03:05.260> two<00:03:06.450> so<00:03:07.450> at<00:03:07.540> this<00:03:07.660> point<00:03:07.900> now

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:08.640 
between the two so at this point now

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:13.319 
between the two so at this point now
just<00:03:09.640> mixing<00:03:10.030> through<00:03:11.220> so<00:03:12.220> I'm<00:03:12.730> gonna<00:03:12.880> I'm

00:03:13.319 --> 00:03:13.329 
just mixing through so I'm gonna I'm

00:03:13.329 --> 00:03:15.800 
just mixing through so I'm gonna I'm
going<00:03:13.510> to<00:03:13.570> tip<00:03:13.720> in<00:03:13.840> some<00:03:14.109> some<00:03:15.040> ground<00:03:15.280> walnuts

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:15.810 
going to tip in some some ground walnuts

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:17.640 
going to tip in some some ground walnuts
they're<00:03:16.810> going<00:03:16.930> to<00:03:16.989> get<00:03:17.109> thrown<00:03:17.290> in<00:03:17.500> and

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:17.650 
they're going to get thrown in and

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:20.940 
they're going to get thrown in and
stirred<00:03:17.859> through<00:03:18.100> as<00:03:18.190> well<00:03:19.350> and<00:03:20.350> the<00:03:20.920> last

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:20.950 
stirred through as well and the last

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:22.319 
stirred through as well and the last
thing<00:03:21.310> I'm<00:03:21.400> going<00:03:21.489> to<00:03:21.549> do<00:03:21.700> now<00:03:21.850> to<00:03:21.910> turn<00:03:22.180> it

00:03:22.319 --> 00:03:22.329 
thing I'm going to do now to turn it

00:03:22.329 --> 00:03:23.759 
thing I'm going to do now to turn it
from<00:03:22.450> being<00:03:22.600> just<00:03:22.690> a<00:03:22.870> ganache<00:03:23.170> into<00:03:23.350> a<00:03:23.470> natural

00:03:23.759 --> 00:03:23.769 
from being just a ganache into a natural

00:03:23.769 --> 00:03:26.069 
from being just a ganache into a natural
cream<00:03:24.040> or<00:03:24.250> music<00:03:24.670> type<00:03:25.269> texture<00:03:25.690> is<00:03:25.780> I'm<00:03:25.930> going

00:03:26.069 --> 00:03:26.079 
cream or music type texture is I'm going

00:03:26.079 --> 00:03:28.830 
cream or music type texture is I'm going
to<00:03:26.140> fall<00:03:26.350> through<00:03:26.459> some<00:03:27.459> pre<00:03:28.269> whipped<00:03:28.480> cream

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:28.840 
to fall through some pre whipped cream

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:37.319 
to fall through some pre whipped cream
so<00:03:29.440> whipping<00:03:29.859> cream<00:03:33.900> 3<00:03:34.900> 3/4<00:03:35.680> whips<00:03:36.209> so<00:03:37.209> it's

00:03:37.319 --> 00:03:37.329 
so whipping cream 3 3/4 whips so it's

00:03:37.329 --> 00:03:39.120 
so whipping cream 3 3/4 whips so it's
got<00:03:37.480> some<00:03:37.510> air<00:03:37.780> air<00:03:38.140> in<00:03:38.319> it<00:03:38.410> but<00:03:38.530> it's<00:03:38.680> not<00:03:38.799> over

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:39.130 
got some air air in it but it's not over

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:45.349 
got some air air in it but it's not over
whipped<00:03:39.310> that's<00:03:40.180> going<00:03:40.359> to<00:03:40.420> go<00:03:40.540> in<00:03:40.690> here<00:03:40.720> and

00:03:45.349 --> 00:03:45.359 

00:03:45.359 --> 00:03:47.460 

we're<00:03:46.359> just<00:03:46.450> going<00:03:46.630> to<00:03:46.720> start<00:03:46.930> to<00:03:47.049> just<00:03:47.079> fold

00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:47.470 
we're just going to start to just fold

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:48.960 
we're just going to start to just fold
that<00:03:47.769> through<00:03:47.829> nice<00:03:48.220> and<00:03:48.519> gently<00:03:48.730> as<00:03:48.880> we're

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:17.440 
going to tap it on every side so one
side<00:04:10.900> second<00:04:14.470> fourth<00:04:15.910> this<00:04:16.910> is<00:04:17.060> just<00:04:17.209> to<00:04:17.299> make

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:17.450 
side second fourth this is just to make

00:04:17.450 --> 00:04:19.060 
side second fourth this is just to make
sure<00:04:17.480> that<00:04:17.840> it's<00:04:17.989> that<00:04:18.079> it's<00:04:18.470> fully<00:04:18.739> mixed

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:19.070 
sure that it's that it's fully mixed

00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:20.860 
sure that it's that it's fully mixed
into<00:04:19.400> each<00:04:19.700> side<00:04:20.000> so<00:04:20.209> they<00:04:20.359> don't<00:04:20.540> get<00:04:20.660> any<00:04:20.750> air

00:04:20.860 --> 00:04:20.870 
into each side so they don't get any air

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:23.260 
into each side so they don't get any air
bubbles<00:04:21.160> and<00:04:22.160> now<00:04:22.430> we<00:04:22.490> can<00:04:22.730> fill<00:04:23.000> them<00:04:23.150> all

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:23.270 
bubbles and now we can fill them all

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:26.440 
bubbles and now we can fill them all
completely<00:04:23.510> I<00:04:24.790> think<00:04:25.790> this<00:04:25.970> one<00:04:26.090> going<00:04:26.210> to<00:04:26.360> the

00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:46.940 
nice kind of warmth a biscuit so that's

00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:48.340 
nice kind of warmth a biscuit so that's
them<00:04:47.090> placed<00:04:47.450> onto<00:04:47.690> some<00:04:48.050> mixed<00:04:48.260> together

00:05:13.450 --> 00:05:13.460 
when it comes out of the oven like this

00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:16.420 
when it comes out of the oven like this
while<00:05:14.390> it's<00:05:14.540> still<00:05:14.720> hot<00:05:15.020> I<00:05:15.350> tend<00:05:15.620> to<00:05:15.680> sprinkle

00:05:16.420 --> 00:05:16.430 
while it's still hot I tend to sprinkle

00:05:16.430 --> 00:05:17.469 
while it's still hot I tend to sprinkle
with<00:05:16.550> a<00:05:16.610> microt

00:05:17.469 --> 00:05:17.479 
with a microt

00:05:17.479 --> 00:05:20.050 
with a microt
this<00:05:18.320> is<00:05:18.470> a<00:05:18.500> powdered<00:05:19.190> cocoa<00:05:19.430> butter<00:05:19.700> from

00:05:20.050 --> 00:05:20.060 
this is a powdered cocoa butter from

00:05:20.060 --> 00:05:22.870 
this is a powdered cocoa butter from
Keller<00:05:20.300> Oh<00:05:21.190> what<00:05:22.190> this<00:05:22.340> will<00:05:22.490> do<00:05:22.580> is<00:05:22.729> it<00:05:22.850> will

00:05:22.870 --> 00:05:22.880 
Keller Oh what this will do is it will

00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:27.880 
Keller Oh what this will do is it will
give<00:05:23.060> me<00:05:23.150> a<00:05:23.210> film<00:05:23.510> of<00:05:23.740> clear<00:05:25.360> non<00:05:26.360> tasting<00:05:26.960> fat

00:05:27.880 --> 00:05:27.890 
give me a film of clear non tasting fat

00:05:27.890 --> 00:05:30.700 
give me a film of clear non tasting fat
so<00:05:28.760> if<00:05:28.880> I<00:05:29.000> put<00:05:29.180> anything<00:05:29.360> soft<00:05:30.200> on<00:05:30.380> to<00:05:30.500> here

00:05:30.700 --> 00:05:30.710 
so if I put anything soft on to here

00:05:30.710 --> 00:05:32.200 
so if I put anything soft on to here
it's<00:05:30.830> not<00:05:30.979> gonna<00:05:31.070> absorb<00:05:31.340> into<00:05:31.669> it<00:05:31.760> too<00:05:31.910> quick

00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:32.210 
it's not gonna absorb into it too quick

00:05:32.210 --> 00:05:34.000 
it's not gonna absorb into it too quick
so<00:05:32.450> it's<00:05:32.930> giving<00:05:33.169> that<00:05:33.229> kind<00:05:33.470> of<00:05:33.500> fat<00:05:33.680> barrier

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:34.010 
so it's giving that kind of fat barrier

00:05:34.010 --> 00:05:37.270 
so it's giving that kind of fat barrier
so<00:05:34.940> stay<00:05:35.720> crispy<00:05:36.110> and<00:05:36.229> crunchy<00:05:36.590> that<00:05:37.100> look<00:05:37.250> a

00:05:37.270 --> 00:05:37.280 
so stay crispy and crunchy that look a

00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:39.700 
so stay crispy and crunchy that look a
bit<00:05:37.460> longer<00:05:38.020> so<00:05:39.020> once<00:05:39.200> it's<00:05:39.350> out<00:05:39.470> of<00:05:39.500> the<00:05:39.620> oven

00:05:39.700 --> 00:05:39.710 
bit longer so once it's out of the oven

00:05:39.710 --> 00:05:41.950 
bit longer so once it's out of the oven
you've<00:05:40.100> put<00:05:40.220> on<00:05:40.250> micro<00:05:40.580> of<00:05:40.760> its<00:05:40.880> cooled<00:05:41.150> I<00:05:41.450> can

00:05:41.950 --> 00:05:41.960 
you've put on micro of its cooled I can

00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:43.600 
you've put on micro of its cooled I can
then<00:05:42.080> use<00:05:42.229> some<00:05:42.410> rods<00:05:42.620> and<00:05:42.800> a<00:05:42.890> knife<00:05:43.310> chopping
