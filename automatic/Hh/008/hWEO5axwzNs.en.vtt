a message or whatever and I will look at
it<00:00:13.830> I<00:00:13.950> think<00:00:14.009> oh<00:00:14.400> yeah<00:00:14.670> that<00:00:14.910> would<00:00:15.059> be<00:00:15.089> cool<00:00:15.389> to

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:15.570 
it I think oh yeah that would be cool to

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:17.990 
it I think oh yeah that would be cool to
do<00:00:15.719> and<00:00:15.990> i'll<00:00:16.109> see<00:00:16.350> if<00:00:16.470> i<00:00:16.619> can<00:00:16.800> get<00:00:16.920> it<00:00:16.980> done<00:00:17.340> so

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:18.000 
do and i'll see if i can get it done so

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.330 
do and i'll see if i can get it done so
i<00:00:18.390> actually<00:00:18.539> had<00:00:18.869> this<00:00:18.960> idea<00:00:19.140> someone<00:00:19.770> who<00:00:20.279> i

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:20.340 
i actually had this idea someone who i

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:23.210 
i actually had this idea someone who i
know<00:00:20.490> in<00:00:20.939> real<00:00:21.180> life<00:00:21.500> he<00:00:22.500> suggested<00:00:23.039> do<00:00:23.160> you

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:23.220 
know in real life he suggested do you

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:25.519 
know in real life he suggested do you
want<00:00:23.400> something<00:00:23.730> made<00:00:23.880> for<00:00:24.029> me<00:00:24.150> so<00:00:25.080> you<00:00:25.140> know<00:00:25.500> i

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:25.529 
want something made for me so you know i

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:27.019 
want something made for me so you know i
thought<00:00:26.010> yeah<00:00:26.279> why<00:00:26.460> not<00:00:26.580> i<00:00:26.640> could<00:00:26.880> make<00:00:27.000> a

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:27.029 
thought yeah why not i could make a

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:29.240 
thought yeah why not i could make a
series<00:00:27.390> out<00:00:27.510> of<00:00:27.660> this<00:00:27.779> because<00:00:28.680> it<00:00:28.800> helps<00:00:29.070> me

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:29.250 
series out of this because it helps me

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:31.099 
series out of this because it helps me
with<00:00:29.400> the<00:00:29.609> inspiration<00:00:30.359> problem<00:00:30.689> which<00:00:30.840> a<00:00:30.960> lot

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:31.109 
with the inspiration problem which a lot

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:34.459 
with the inspiration problem which a lot
of<00:00:31.140> redstone<00:00:31.529> is<00:00:31.650> face<00:00:32.059> so<00:00:33.059> that<00:00:33.780> is<00:00:33.989> what

00:00:34.459 --> 00:00:34.469 
of redstone is face so that is what

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:35.660 
of redstone is face so that is what
we're<00:00:34.649> going<00:00:34.770> to<00:00:34.860> have<00:00:34.890> today<00:00:35.219> so<00:00:35.280> this<00:00:35.579> is

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:35.670 
we're going to have today so this is

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:38.139 
we're going to have today so this is
episode<00:00:35.910> 1<00:00:36.210> and<00:00:36.450> today<00:00:36.780> it<00:00:37.020> is<00:00:37.200> an<00:00:37.350> infinitely

00:00:38.139 --> 00:00:38.149 
episode 1 and today it is an infinitely

00:00:38.149 --> 00:00:41.630 
episode 1 and today it is an infinitely
vertically<00:00:39.149> staff<00:00:39.800> stackable<00:00:40.800> as<00:00:41.040> a<00:00:41.219> mouthful

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:41.640 
vertically staff stackable as a mouthful

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:44.209 
vertically staff stackable as a mouthful
infinitely<00:00:42.510> vertically<00:00:43.079> stackable<00:00:43.620> triple

00:00:44.209 --> 00:00:44.219 
infinitely vertically stackable triple

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:46.580 
infinitely vertically stackable triple
piston<00:00:44.550> extender<00:00:45.079> horizontal<00:00:46.079> trip<00:00:46.230> missing

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:46.590 
piston extender horizontal trip missing

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:49.100 
piston extender horizontal trip missing
extender<00:00:46.980> that<00:00:47.100> is<00:00:47.309> so<00:00:48.180> let's<00:00:48.690> just<00:00:48.870> pick<00:00:49.020> this

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110 
extender that is so let's just pick this

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:51.979 
extender that is so let's just pick this
lever<00:00:49.789> you<00:00:50.789> can<00:00:50.910> see<00:00:51.030> it<00:00:51.090> extends<00:00:51.570> nice<00:00:51.780> and

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:51.989 
lever you can see it extends nice and

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:57.529 
lever you can see it extends nice and
quickly<00:00:52.170> and<00:00:53.840> it<00:00:54.840> also<00:00:55.940> we're<00:00:56.940> tracks<00:00:57.210> very

00:00:57.529 --> 00:00:57.539 
quickly and it also we're tracks very

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:03.910 
quickly and it also we're tracks very
quickly<00:01:00.199> as<00:01:01.199> you<00:01:01.440> can<00:01:01.530> see<00:01:01.829> now<00:01:02.670> this<00:01:03.270> thing<00:01:03.329> is

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:03.920 
quickly as you can see now this thing is

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:06.980 
quickly as you can see now this thing is
pretty<00:01:04.920> quick<00:01:05.220> and<00:01:05.400> pretty<00:01:05.580> simple<00:01:06.090> now<00:01:06.780> in

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
pretty quick and pretty simple now in

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:08.899 
pretty quick and pretty simple now in
order<00:01:07.170> to<00:01:07.350> get<00:01:07.560> it<00:01:07.680> this<00:01:07.830> size<00:01:08.159> I<00:01:08.430> had<00:01:08.729> to

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909 
order to get it this size I had to

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:10.609 
order to get it this size I had to
basically<00:01:09.090> make<00:01:09.420> it<00:01:09.600> to<00:01:09.810> tool<00:01:10.049> where<00:01:10.290> all<00:01:10.470> the

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619 
basically make it to tool where all the

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:13.160 
basically make it to tool where all the
inputs<00:01:10.979> will<00:01:11.520> with<00:01:11.700> repeaters<00:01:12.299> so<00:01:12.750> I<00:01:12.810> managed

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
inputs will with repeaters so I managed

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:15.080 
inputs will with repeaters so I managed
to<00:01:13.200> do<00:01:13.409> that<00:01:13.439> and<00:01:13.770> then<00:01:13.920> I<00:01:14.100> could<00:01:14.159> simply<00:01:14.820> stack

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
to do that and then I could simply stack

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:16.550 
to do that and then I could simply stack
all<00:01:15.270> the<00:01:15.330> layers<00:01:15.479> on<00:01:15.689> top<00:01:15.720> of<00:01:16.020> each<00:01:16.110> other<00:01:16.259> and

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
all the layers on top of each other and

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:19.249 
all the layers on top of each other and
get<00:01:17.310> a<00:01:17.340> finished<00:01:17.909> design<00:01:18.270> apart<00:01:18.960> from<00:01:19.080> this

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259 
get a finished design apart from this

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:21.620 
get a finished design apart from this
tower<00:01:19.530> up<00:01:19.680> here<00:01:19.920> this<00:01:20.460> slab<00:01:20.820> tower<00:01:21.119> that's

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
tower up here this slab tower that's

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:24.490 
tower up here this slab tower that's
basically<00:01:22.080> just<00:01:22.290> to<00:01:22.409> get<00:01:22.530> the<00:01:22.619> final<00:01:22.830> pulse<00:01:23.250> so

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:24.500 
basically just to get the final pulse so

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:27.980 
basically just to get the final pulse so
that's<00:01:25.500> all<00:01:25.680> that's<00:01:25.830> for<00:01:26.540> so<00:01:27.540> a<00:01:27.570> quick<00:01:27.720> bit<00:01:27.960> of

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990 
that's all that's for so a quick bit of

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:29.450 
that's all that's for so a quick bit of
explanation<00:01:28.259> if<00:01:28.740> I<00:01:28.860> just<00:01:29.009> get<00:01:29.159> rid<00:01:29.250> of<00:01:29.340> this

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
explanation if I just get rid of this

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:33.109 
explanation if I just get rid of this
torch<00:01:29.790> and<00:01:30.860> that<00:01:31.860> for<00:01:32.100> the<00:01:32.130> moment<00:01:32.340> you<00:01:32.970> can

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:33.119 
torch and that for the moment you can

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:36.940 
torch and that for the moment you can
see<00:01:33.329> first<00:01:34.140> bit<00:01:34.409> this<00:01:34.590> is<00:01:34.650> just<00:01:34.979> extension<00:01:35.670> and

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:36.950 
see first bit this is just extension and

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:39.980 
see first bit this is just extension and
it<00:01:37.950> does<00:01:38.189> that<00:01:38.220> so<00:01:38.909> it's<00:01:39.150> very<00:01:39.360> simple<00:01:39.630> against

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:39.990 
it does that so it's very simple against

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:41.719 
it does that so it's very simple against
are<00:01:40.140> all<00:01:40.259> done<00:01:40.500> in<00:01:40.680> such<00:01:40.829> a<00:01:40.890> tiny<00:01:41.250> amount<00:01:41.430> of

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:41.729 
are all done in such a tiny amount of

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:44.330 
are all done in such a tiny amount of
space<00:01:42.030> that's<00:01:42.390> nice<00:01:42.630> and<00:01:42.960> this<00:01:43.619> 40<00:01:44.009> repeater

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:44.340 
space that's nice and this 40 repeater

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:47.480 
space that's nice and this 40 repeater
that<00:01:44.670> also<00:01:45.030> pulls<00:01:45.360> this<00:01:45.840> piston<00:01:46.320> back<00:01:46.500> as<00:01:46.979> well

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:47.490 
that also pulls this piston back as well

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:51.950 
that also pulls this piston back as well
so<00:01:48.240> that's<00:01:48.360> great<00:01:48.720> and<00:01:49.490> then<00:01:50.630> because<00:01:51.630> we<00:01:51.780> get

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:51.960 
so that's great and then because we get

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:53.359 
so that's great and then because we get
an<00:01:52.110> extra<00:01:52.229> bit<00:01:52.500> of<00:01:52.530> delay<00:01:52.680> here<00:01:53.009> we<00:01:53.100> can<00:01:53.250> simply

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:53.369 
an extra bit of delay here we can simply

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:55.910 
an extra bit of delay here we can simply
send<00:01:53.640> another<00:01:53.970> to<00:01:54.210> tick<00:01:54.479> and<00:01:54.689> power<00:01:55.140> this<00:01:55.530> and

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 
send another to tick and power this and

00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:00.170 
send another to tick and power this and
it<00:01:56.850> all<00:01:56.969> works<00:01:57.180> out<00:01:57.420> very<00:01:57.829> nicely<00:01:58.880> the<00:01:59.880> reason

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:00.180 
it all works out very nicely the reason

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:01.700 
it all works out very nicely the reason
we<00:02:00.270> can't<00:02:00.479> just<00:02:00.659> send<00:02:00.780> more<00:02:00.990> delay<00:02:01.259> into<00:02:01.500> this

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:01.710 
we can't just send more delay into this

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:04.459 
we can't just send more delay into this
one<00:02:01.979> is<00:02:02.219> because<00:02:02.670> it<00:02:02.880> has<00:02:03.030> the<00:02:03.210> turn<00:02:03.420> off<00:02:03.659> once

00:02:04.459 --> 00:02:04.469 
one is because it has the turn off once

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:06.520 
one is because it has the turn off once
already<00:02:04.710> so

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:06.530 
already so

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:08.800 
already so
we<00:02:07.310> can<00:02:07.460> only<00:02:07.549> use<00:02:07.700> inputs<00:02:08.090> that<00:02:08.179> have<00:02:08.479> to<00:02:08.600> turn

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:08.810 
we can only use inputs that have to turn

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:12.040 
we can only use inputs that have to turn
off<00:02:08.840> just<00:02:09.679> the<00:02:09.770> once<00:02:10.330> so<00:02:11.330> this<00:02:11.510> final<00:02:11.870> pulse

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:12.050 
off just the once so this final pulse

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:13.449 
off just the once so this final pulse
the<00:02:12.200> way<00:02:12.290> I<00:02:12.319> did<00:02:12.440> it<00:02:12.650> was<00:02:12.770> put<00:02:12.950> a<00:02:12.980> torch<00:02:13.250> down

00:02:13.449 --> 00:02:13.459 
the way I did it was put a torch down

00:02:13.459 --> 00:02:16.090 
the way I did it was put a torch down
here<00:02:13.730> um<00:02:14.080> and<00:02:15.080> a<00:02:15.230> solid<00:02:15.560> block<00:02:15.680> it<00:02:15.980> would

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:16.100 
here um and a solid block it would

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:18.160 
here um and a solid block it would
simply<00:02:16.400> get<00:02:16.580> pulled<00:02:16.819> over<00:02:16.910> this<00:02:17.180> torch<00:02:17.480> and

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:18.170 
simply get pulled over this torch and

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:19.780 
simply get pulled over this torch and
when<00:02:18.410> the<00:02:18.500> solid<00:02:18.800> block<00:02:18.950> goes<00:02:19.130> over<00:02:19.520> power

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:19.790 
when the solid block goes over power

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:22.809 
when the solid block goes over power
goes<00:02:20.000> up<00:02:20.180> here<00:02:20.450> but<00:02:21.290> then<00:02:21.470> the<00:02:21.950> block<00:02:22.370> quickly

00:02:22.809 --> 00:02:22.819 
goes up here but then the block quickly

00:02:22.819 --> 00:02:25.270 
goes up here but then the block quickly
gets<00:02:23.000> retracted<00:02:23.300> so<00:02:23.810> as<00:02:24.410> soon<00:02:24.620> as<00:02:24.739> it's<00:02:24.890> on<00:02:25.040> it

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:25.280 
gets retracted so as soon as it's on it

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:27.670 
gets retracted so as soon as it's on it
comes<00:02:25.550> off<00:02:25.790> and<00:02:26.060> that<00:02:26.810> creates<00:02:27.170> a<00:02:27.260> quick<00:02:27.440> pulse

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:27.680 
comes off and that creates a quick pulse

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:31.090 
comes off and that creates a quick pulse
which<00:02:28.040> it<00:02:28.340> removes<00:02:28.910> the<00:02:29.180> need<00:02:29.209> for<00:02:30.170> a<00:02:30.470> pulse

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:31.100 
which it removes the need for a pulse

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:33.430 
which it removes the need for a pulse
generator<00:02:31.610> and<00:02:31.850> this<00:02:32.000> is<00:02:32.150> very<00:02:32.390> helpful<00:02:32.600> does

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:33.440 
generator and this is very helpful does

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:35.590 
generator and this is very helpful does
make<00:02:33.620> it<00:02:33.770> slightly<00:02:33.980> larger<00:02:34.610> but<00:02:35.300> you<00:02:35.480> know

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:35.600 
make it slightly larger but you know

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:38.140 
make it slightly larger but you know
what<00:02:35.900> are<00:02:35.959> you<00:02:36.020> gonna<00:02:36.140> do<00:02:36.520> so<00:02:37.520> I<00:02:37.550> guess<00:02:37.670> as<00:02:37.970> this

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:38.150 
what are you gonna do so I guess as this

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:39.640 
what are you gonna do so I guess as this
is<00:02:38.330> a<00:02:38.360> request<00:02:38.720> it<00:02:39.019> would<00:02:39.110> be<00:02:39.170> pretty<00:02:39.380> useless

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:39.650 
is a request it would be pretty useless

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:41.560 
is a request it would be pretty useless
if<00:02:39.980> I<00:02:40.100> didn't<00:02:40.400> show<00:02:40.580> you<00:02:40.640> how<00:02:40.790> to<00:02:40.850> build<00:02:41.209> it<00:02:41.420> so

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:41.570 
if I didn't show you how to build it so

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:43.210 
if I didn't show you how to build it so
it's<00:02:41.750> pretty<00:02:41.930> simple<00:02:42.170> and<00:02:42.470> I'll<00:02:42.890> get<00:02:43.070> right

00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:43.220 
it's pretty simple and I'll get right

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:46.000 
it's pretty simple and I'll get right
into<00:02:43.430> it<00:02:43.580> now<00:02:43.820> so<00:02:44.810> it's<00:02:44.900> tough<00:02:45.110> start<00:02:45.650> off<00:02:45.830> with

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:46.010 
into it now so it's tough start off with

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:47.970 
into it now so it's tough start off with
you're<00:02:46.130> gonna<00:02:46.250> need<00:02:46.430> it<00:02:46.580> a<00:02:46.730> five<00:02:47.269> by<00:02:47.540> seven

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:47.980 
you're gonna need it a five by seven

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:50.890 
you're gonna need it a five by seven
area<00:02:48.980> and<00:02:49.610> then<00:02:49.730> in<00:02:49.940> the<00:02:50.060> middle<00:02:50.209> of<00:02:50.300> this<00:02:50.420> area

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:50.900 
area and then in the middle of this area

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:52.390 
area and then in the middle of this area
and<00:02:51.050> one<00:02:51.380> block<00:02:51.560> from<00:02:51.590> the<00:02:51.800> end<00:02:51.980> place<00:02:52.190> your

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:52.400 
and one block from the end place your

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:54.670 
and one block from the end place your
three<00:02:52.640> piston<00:02:53.060> so<00:02:53.239> you<00:02:53.330> have<00:02:53.540> it<00:02:54.140> looking<00:02:54.620> like

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:54.680 
three piston so you have it looking like

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:57.009 
three piston so you have it looking like
this<00:02:55.100> then<00:02:55.730> place<00:02:56.000> your<00:02:56.030> block<00:02:56.360> on<00:02:56.540> front<00:02:56.840> and

00:02:57.009 --> 00:02:57.019 
this then place your block on front and

00:02:57.019 --> 00:02:58.840 
this then place your block on front and
you're<00:02:57.260> ready<00:02:57.410> to<00:02:57.560> go<00:02:57.860> I'm<00:02:58.400> actually<00:02:58.550> going<00:02:58.760> to

00:02:58.840 --> 00:02:58.850 
you're ready to go I'm actually going to

00:02:58.850 --> 00:03:02.110 
you're ready to go I'm actually going to
have<00:02:58.940> to<00:02:59.090> raise<00:02:59.360> this<00:02:59.830> network<00:03:00.830> nevermind<00:03:01.400> so

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:02.120 
have to raise this network nevermind so

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:03.370 
have to raise this network nevermind so
the<00:03:02.540> first<00:03:02.780> thing<00:03:02.840> you're<00:03:03.019> gonna<00:03:03.110> do<00:03:03.350> is

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:03.380 
the first thing you're gonna do is

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:07.180 
the first thing you're gonna do is
basically<00:03:04.010> just<00:03:05.080> replace<00:03:06.080> all<00:03:06.380> these<00:03:06.650> with

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:07.190 
basically just replace all these with

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:13.120 
basically just replace all these with
solid<00:03:07.700> blocks<00:03:09.130> like<00:03:10.130> that<00:03:11.090> and<00:03:11.570> then<00:03:12.530> this<00:03:12.920> is

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:13.130 
solid blocks like that and then this is

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:15.240 
solid blocks like that and then this is
your<00:03:13.160> extension<00:03:13.850> so<00:03:14.060> one<00:03:14.299> tick<00:03:14.480> repeat<00:03:14.750> here

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:15.250 
your extension so one tick repeat here

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:18.520 
your extension so one tick repeat here
to<00:03:16.250> take<00:03:16.459> repeater<00:03:16.760> there<00:03:17.090> and<00:03:17.299> a<00:03:17.780> dust<00:03:18.079> along

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:18.530 
to take repeater there and a dust along

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:20.920 
to take repeater there and a dust along
there<00:03:18.860> just<00:03:19.340> join<00:03:19.579> us<00:03:19.760> all<00:03:19.910> up<00:03:20.090> put<00:03:20.120> dust<00:03:20.660> along

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:20.930 
there just join us all up put dust along

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:24.009 
there just join us all up put dust along
the<00:03:21.079> whole<00:03:21.230> of<00:03:21.260> this<00:03:21.560> row<00:03:21.860> and<00:03:22.790> then<00:03:23.019> 240

00:03:24.009 --> 00:03:24.019 
the whole of this row and then 240

00:03:24.019 --> 00:03:26.949 
the whole of this row and then 240
repeaters<00:03:24.470> here<00:03:24.820> actually<00:03:25.820> just<00:03:26.269> don't<00:03:26.510> do

00:03:26.949 --> 00:03:26.959 
repeaters here actually just don't do

00:03:26.959 --> 00:03:29.949 
repeaters here actually just don't do
that<00:03:26.989> there<00:03:27.440> 148<00:03:28.400> repeater<00:03:28.670> their<00:03:28.970> rock<00:03:29.660> there

00:03:29.949 --> 00:03:29.959 
that there 148 repeater their rock there

00:03:29.959 --> 00:03:32.289 
that there 148 repeater their rock there
now<00:03:30.590> we<00:03:30.650> can<00:03:30.829> try<00:03:31.010> this<00:03:31.070> out<00:03:31.340> extension<00:03:32.090> and

00:03:32.289 --> 00:03:32.299 
now we can try this out extension and

00:03:32.299 --> 00:03:34.900 
now we can try this out extension and
quite<00:03:33.079> a<00:03:33.110> bit<00:03:33.290> of<00:03:33.380> a<00:03:33.470> retraction<00:03:33.829> done<00:03:34.160> already

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:34.910 
quite a bit of a retraction done already

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:37.270 
quite a bit of a retraction done already
so<00:03:35.660> you<00:03:35.750> can<00:03:35.870> see<00:03:36.049> how<00:03:36.230> cool<00:03:36.650> this<00:03:36.859> design<00:03:37.250> is

00:03:37.270 --> 00:03:37.280 
so you can see how cool this design is

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:41.949 
so you can see how cool this design is
now<00:03:38.000> for<00:03:38.180> this<00:03:38.269> bit<00:03:38.510> just<00:03:39.160> do<00:03:40.160> this<00:03:40.630> dust<00:03:41.630> to

00:03:41.949 --> 00:03:41.959 
now for this bit just do this dust to

00:03:41.959 --> 00:03:44.740 
now for this bit just do this dust to
tick<00:03:42.590> and<00:03:42.829> there<00:03:43.070> you<00:03:43.160> go<00:03:43.220> so<00:03:44.180> now<00:03:44.359> if<00:03:44.480> we<00:03:44.570> flip

00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:44.750 
tick and there you go so now if we flip

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:46.120 
tick and there you go so now if we flip
the<00:03:44.810> lever<00:03:44.989> we<00:03:45.290> should<00:03:45.470> see<00:03:45.680> an<00:03:45.829> extra

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:46.130 
the lever we should see an extra

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:49.210 
the lever we should see an extra
movement<00:03:46.310> in<00:03:46.670> there<00:03:46.910> already<00:03:47.510> and<00:03:48.170> that<00:03:48.230> is

00:03:49.210 --> 00:03:49.220 
movement in there already and that is

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:50.920 
movement in there already and that is
really<00:03:49.489> all<00:03:49.609> there<00:03:50.000> is<00:03:50.030> to<00:03:50.329> it<00:03:50.359> I<00:03:50.600> just<00:03:50.780> had<00:03:50.900> to

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:50.930 
really all there is to it I just had to

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:53.349 
really all there is to it I just had to
add<00:03:51.170> in<00:03:51.320> that<00:03:51.470> final<00:03:51.769> movement<00:03:52.280> so<00:03:53.060> break<00:03:53.329> a

00:03:53.349 --> 00:03:53.359 
add in that final movement so break a

00:03:53.359 --> 00:03:55.720 
add in that final movement so break a
rock<00:03:53.570> down<00:03:53.630> here<00:03:54.019> place<00:03:54.530> a<00:03:54.560> torch<00:03:54.859> there<00:03:55.430> by

00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:55.730 
rock down here place a torch there by

00:03:55.730 --> 00:03:58.870 
rock down here place a torch there by
the<00:03:55.790> end<00:03:56.090> and<00:03:56.769> then<00:03:57.769> you<00:03:58.130> just<00:03:58.310> need<00:03:58.519> to<00:03:58.670> build

00:03:58.870 --> 00:03:58.880 
the end and then you just need to build

00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:01.210 
the end and then you just need to build
a<00:03:59.090> slab<00:03:59.450> tower<00:03:59.810> up<00:04:00.079> now<00:04:00.530> it<00:04:00.590> always<00:04:00.799> amazes<00:04:01.070> me

00:04:01.210 --> 00:04:01.220 
a slab tower up now it always amazes me

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:03.490 
a slab tower up now it always amazes me
when<00:04:01.519> I<00:04:01.579> see<00:04:01.820> people<00:04:01.850> building<00:04:02.480> these<00:04:02.660> because

00:04:03.490 --> 00:04:03.500 
when I see people building these because

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:06.849 
when I see people building these because
they<00:04:03.859> do<00:04:03.920> some<00:04:04.340> weird<00:04:04.640> thing<00:04:04.970> like<00:04:05.500> they<00:04:06.500> place

00:04:06.849 --> 00:04:06.859 
they do some weird thing like they place

00:04:06.859 --> 00:04:08.680 
they do some weird thing like they place
all<00:04:07.100> this

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:08.690 
all this

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:12.090 
all this
and<00:04:08.810> no<00:04:09.650> don't<00:04:10.010> do<00:04:10.190> that<00:04:10.370> all<00:04:10.970> you<00:04:11.090> have<00:04:11.210> to<00:04:11.330> do

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:12.100 
and no don't do that all you have to do

00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:16.360 
and no don't do that all you have to do
so<00:04:13.100> right<00:04:14.050> block<00:04:15.050> place<00:04:15.650> a<00:04:15.680> block<00:04:15.920> on<00:04:15.980> top<00:04:16.160> of

00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:16.370 
so right block place a block on top of

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:20.500 
so right block place a block on top of
the<00:04:16.430> slab<00:04:16.700> and<00:04:17.480> a<00:04:17.630> slab<00:04:17.900> there<00:04:19.120> that<00:04:20.120> is<00:04:20.269> all

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:20.510 
the slab and a slab there that is all

00:04:20.510 --> 00:04:22.390 
the slab and a slab there that is all
you<00:04:20.660> have<00:04:20.780> to<00:04:20.900> do<00:04:21.049> to<00:04:21.320> build<00:04:21.500> a<00:04:21.709> quick<00:04:22.160> and

00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:22.400 
you have to do to build a quick and

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:24.910 
you have to do to build a quick and
efficient<00:04:22.910> slab<00:04:23.180> staircase<00:04:23.840> then<00:04:24.560> break<00:04:24.800> out

00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:24.920 
efficient slab staircase then break out

00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:26.680 
efficient slab staircase then break out
those<00:04:25.070> box<00:04:25.310> when<00:04:25.490> you're<00:04:25.610> done<00:04:25.760> fill<00:04:26.480> it<00:04:26.600> in

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:26.690 
those box when you're done fill it in

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:30.910 
those box when you're done fill it in
with<00:04:26.810> redstone<00:04:27.190> simple<00:04:28.190> as<00:04:28.280> that<00:04:28.690> now<00:04:29.920> it's

00:04:30.910 --> 00:04:30.920 
with redstone simple as that now it's

00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:32.470 
with redstone simple as that now it's
not<00:04:31.130> actually<00:04:31.370> necessary<00:04:31.400> for<00:04:32.030> the<00:04:32.090> bottom

00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:32.480 
not actually necessary for the bottom

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:36.460 
not actually necessary for the bottom
but<00:04:33.110> what<00:04:33.320> you<00:04:33.410> need<00:04:33.560> to<00:04:33.710> do<00:04:33.860> not<00:04:34.490> that<00:04:35.470> you

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:36.470 
but what you need to do not that you

00:04:36.470 --> 00:04:40.390 
but what you need to do not that you
need<00:04:37.150> three<00:04:38.150> want<00:04:38.510> equal<00:04:38.780> pieces<00:04:38.960> so<00:04:39.710> what<00:04:40.340> am

00:04:40.390 --> 00:04:40.400 
need three want equal pieces so what am

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:45.490 
need three want equal pieces so what am
I<00:04:40.460> doing<00:04:40.490> here<00:04:41.380> and<00:04:42.380> one<00:04:42.860> second<00:04:44.350> get<00:04:45.350> my

00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:45.500 
I doing here and one second get my

00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:49.120 
I doing here and one second get my
repeaters<00:04:45.950> back<00:04:46.130> or<00:04:46.250> so<00:04:46.400> you<00:04:46.610> need<00:04:47.590> one<00:04:48.590> two

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:49.130 
repeaters back or so you need one two

00:04:49.130 --> 00:04:52.150 
repeaters back or so you need one two
and<00:04:49.370> three<00:04:49.880> thus<00:04:50.450> there<00:04:50.750> and<00:04:51.650> that<00:04:51.800> should<00:04:52.040> all

00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:52.160 
and three thus there and that should all

00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:56.020 
and three thus there and that should all
work<00:04:52.340> nicely<00:04:52.670> so<00:04:53.510> to<00:04:53.600> stack<00:04:54.110> this<00:04:54.260> up<00:04:54.910> all<00:04:55.910> you

00:04:56.020 --> 00:04:56.030 
work nicely so to stack this up all you

00:04:56.030 --> 00:04:57.790 
work nicely so to stack this up all you
have<00:04:56.150> to<00:04:56.270> do<00:04:56.390> is<00:04:56.600> place<00:04:56.780> blocks<00:04:57.050> on<00:04:57.320> top<00:04:57.350> and

00:04:57.790 --> 00:04:57.800 
have to do is place blocks on top and

00:04:57.800 --> 00:04:59.590 
have to do is place blocks on top and
you<00:04:57.950> can<00:04:57.980> hold<00:04:58.280> shift<00:04:58.640> and<00:04:58.850> fly<00:04:59.090> by<00:04:59.270> doing<00:04:59.480> this

00:04:59.590 --> 00:04:59.600 
you can hold shift and fly by doing this

00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:01.420 
you can hold shift and fly by doing this
if<00:04:59.780> you<00:04:59.810> weren't<00:04:59.930> created<00:05:00.170> by<00:05:00.590> the<00:05:00.650> way<00:05:00.830> very

00:05:01.420 --> 00:05:01.430 
if you weren't created by the way very

00:05:01.430 --> 00:05:03.310 
if you weren't created by the way very
simple<00:05:01.880> if<00:05:02.210> you're<00:05:02.480> in<00:05:02.570> survival<00:05:02.690> you<00:05:03.170> can

00:05:03.310 --> 00:05:03.320 
simple if you're in survival you can

00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:05.920 
simple if you're in survival you can
still<00:05:03.530> hold<00:05:03.710> shift<00:05:04.040> and<00:05:04.250> place<00:05:05.090> blocks<00:05:05.540> on<00:05:05.870> top

00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:05.930 
still hold shift and place blocks on top

00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:10.150 
still hold shift and place blocks on top
of<00:05:06.290> right<00:05:07.280> clickable<00:05:07.730> objects<00:05:08.470> do<00:05:09.470> this<00:05:09.740> so

00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:10.160 
of right clickable objects do this so

00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:12.640 
of right clickable objects do this so
remember<00:05:10.490> you<00:05:10.910> need<00:05:11.060> for<00:05:11.480> tick<00:05:11.690> there<00:05:11.990> for

00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:12.650 
remember you need for tick there for

00:05:12.650 --> 00:05:14.740 
remember you need for tick there for
tick<00:05:12.890> there<00:05:13.130> and<00:05:13.400> for<00:05:13.760> tick<00:05:13.970> there<00:05:14.210> one<00:05:14.600> take

00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:14.750 
tick there and for tick there one take

00:05:14.750 --> 00:05:16.960 
tick there and for tick there one take
here<00:05:14.960> to<00:05:15.230> tick<00:05:15.410> there<00:05:15.650> now<00:05:16.460> just<00:05:16.669> place<00:05:16.820> your

00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:16.970 
here to tick there now just place your

00:05:16.970 --> 00:05:22.960 
here to tick there now just place your
Pistons<00:05:17.470> point<00:05:18.470> did<00:05:19.250> it<00:05:19.300> get<00:05:20.300> it<00:05:20.660> and<00:05:21.970> I'm

00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:22.970 
Pistons point did it get it and I'm

00:05:22.970 --> 00:05:26.920 
Pistons point did it get it and I'm
actually<00:05:23.590> going<00:05:24.590> to<00:05:25.090> for<00:05:26.090> the<00:05:26.210> sake<00:05:26.419> of<00:05:26.480> this

00:05:26.920 --> 00:05:26.930 
actually going to for the sake of this

00:05:26.930 --> 00:05:31.270 
actually going to for the sake of this
do<00:05:28.750> that<00:05:29.750> I<00:05:30.140> think<00:05:30.440> that's<00:05:30.770> what<00:05:30.950> it<00:05:31.040> should<00:05:31.070> be

00:05:31.270 --> 00:05:31.280 
do that I think that's what it should be

00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:35.590 
do that I think that's what it should be
anyway<00:05:31.610> so<00:05:31.760> just<00:05:32.060> replace<00:05:32.419> that<00:05:33.850> and<00:05:34.850> then

00:05:35.590 --> 00:05:35.600 
anyway so just replace that and then

00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:38.920 
anyway so just replace that and then
it's<00:05:35.960> very<00:05:36.080> easy<00:05:36.830> just<00:05:37.220> copy<00:05:37.970> basically<00:05:38.780> what

00:05:38.920 --> 00:05:38.930 
it's very easy just copy basically what

00:05:38.930 --> 00:05:42.180 
it's very easy just copy basically what
you've<00:05:39.050> got<00:05:39.169> on<00:05:39.200> the<00:05:39.320> bottom<00:05:39.680> and<00:05:40.690> then<00:05:41.690> this

00:05:42.180 --> 00:05:42.190 
you've got on the bottom and then this

00:05:42.190 --> 00:05:45.850 
you've got on the bottom and then this
this<00:05:43.190> pulse<00:05:43.610> you<00:05:43.910> just<00:05:44.090> have<00:05:44.240> to<00:05:44.530> copy<00:05:45.530> it<00:05:45.740> over

00:05:45.850 --> 00:05:45.860 
this pulse you just have to copy it over

00:05:45.860 --> 00:05:47.740 
this pulse you just have to copy it over
now<00:05:46.580> because<00:05:46.730> I've<00:05:47.030> messed<00:05:47.240> this<00:05:47.360> up<00:05:47.570> a<00:05:47.720> bit

00:05:47.740 --> 00:05:47.750 
now because I've messed this up a bit

00:05:47.750 --> 00:05:50.810 
now because I've messed this up a bit
it's<00:05:48.530> going<00:05:48.710> to<00:05:48.770> be<00:05:48.890> a<00:05:48.919> bit<00:05:49.130> weird

00:05:50.810 --> 00:05:50.820 
it's going to be a bit weird

00:05:50.820 --> 00:05:55.830 
it's going to be a bit weird
but<00:05:51.820> something<00:05:52.660> along<00:05:53.050> these<00:05:53.290> lines<00:05:53.400> and<00:05:54.840> that

00:05:55.830 --> 00:05:55.840 
but something along these lines and that

00:05:55.840 --> 00:06:00.779 
but something along these lines and that
should<00:05:56.169> be<00:05:56.590> stackable<00:05:57.460> so<00:05:59.039> yes<00:06:00.039> there's<00:06:00.610> my

00:06:00.779 --> 00:06:00.789 
should be stackable so yes there's my

00:06:00.789 --> 00:06:04.560 
should be stackable so yes there's my
problem<00:06:01.380> place<00:06:02.380> your<00:06:02.560> lever<00:06:02.740> there<00:06:03.360> now<00:06:04.360> one

00:06:04.560 --> 00:06:04.570 
problem place your lever there now one

00:06:04.570 --> 00:06:09.029 
problem place your lever there now one
problem<00:06:04.840> with<00:06:04.990> this<00:06:05.050> design<00:06:05.500> is<00:06:07.440> the<00:06:08.440> input<00:06:08.650> as

00:06:09.029 --> 00:06:09.039 
problem with this design is the input as

00:06:09.039 --> 00:06:11.189 
problem with this design is the input as
you<00:06:09.190> can<00:06:09.340> see<00:06:09.580> if<00:06:10.180> we<00:06:10.419> start<00:06:10.630> setting<00:06:10.960> this<00:06:11.050> up

00:06:11.189 --> 00:06:11.199 
you can see if we start setting this up

00:06:11.199 --> 00:06:13.140 
you can see if we start setting this up
to<00:06:11.620> what<00:06:11.800> we<00:06:11.919> have<00:06:12.100> here<00:06:12.460> we<00:06:12.880> need<00:06:13.060> to

00:06:13.140 --> 00:06:13.150 
to what we have here we need to

00:06:13.150 --> 00:06:14.939 
to what we have here we need to
introduce<00:06:13.389> a<00:06:13.780> slab<00:06:14.080> tower<00:06:14.380> to<00:06:14.590> actually<00:06:14.860> get

00:06:14.939 --> 00:06:14.949 
introduce a slab tower to actually get

00:06:14.949 --> 00:06:16.020 
introduce a slab tower to actually get
the<00:06:14.979> input<00:06:15.370> to<00:06:15.490> all<00:06:15.610> of<00:06:15.729> these<00:06:15.820> different

00:06:16.020 --> 00:06:16.030 
the input to all of these different

00:06:16.030 --> 00:06:17.430 
the input to all of these different
things<00:06:16.479> because<00:06:16.990> they're<00:06:17.289> not

00:06:17.430 --> 00:06:17.440 
things because they're not

00:06:17.440 --> 00:06:20.760 
things because they're not
interconnected<00:06:17.759> now<00:06:19.229> this<00:06:20.229> is<00:06:20.380> a<00:06:20.410> bit<00:06:20.620> of<00:06:20.650> a

00:06:20.760 --> 00:06:20.770 
interconnected now this is a bit of a

00:06:20.770 --> 00:06:22.170 
interconnected now this is a bit of a
problem<00:06:20.800> because<00:06:21.190> what<00:06:21.639> you<00:06:21.729> actually<00:06:21.880> need

00:06:22.170 --> 00:06:22.180 
problem because what you actually need

00:06:22.180 --> 00:06:26.670 
problem because what you actually need
is<00:06:22.419> a<00:06:23.250> least<00:06:24.250> a<00:06:24.550> signal<00:06:24.940> strength<00:06:25.180> of<00:06:25.360> 8<00:06:25.680> into

00:06:26.670 --> 00:06:26.680 
is a least a signal strength of 8 into

00:06:26.680 --> 00:06:29.189 
is a least a signal strength of 8 into
this<00:06:26.860> dust<00:06:27.190> there<00:06:27.460> or<00:06:27.639> seven<00:06:28.389> or<00:06:28.539> eight<00:06:28.690> seven

Orioles<00:06:29.460> one<00:06:30.460> of<00:06:30.490> those<00:06:30.669> two<00:06:31.680> but<00:06:32.680> what<00:06:32.949> that

00:06:33.090 --> 00:06:33.100 
Orioles one of those two but what that

00:06:33.100 --> 00:06:36.900 
Orioles one of those two but what that
will<00:06:33.280> do<00:06:33.430> is<00:06:34.470> it<00:06:35.470> will<00:06:35.530> give<00:06:36.400> just<00:06:36.789> enough

00:06:36.900 --> 00:06:36.910 
will do is it will give just enough

00:06:36.910 --> 00:06:38.430 
will do is it will give just enough
signal<00:06:37.389> to<00:06:37.510> get<00:06:37.600> to<00:06:37.720> the<00:06:37.780> end<00:06:37.930> here<00:06:37.990> because<00:06:38.350> if

00:06:38.430 --> 00:06:38.440 
signal to get to the end here because if

00:06:38.440 --> 00:06:39.960 
signal to get to the end here because if
we<00:06:38.530> don't<00:06:38.650> have<00:06:38.830> enough<00:06:39.070> it<00:06:39.310> won't<00:06:39.490> work<00:06:39.729> it

00:06:39.960 --> 00:06:39.970 
we don't have enough it won't work it

00:06:39.970 --> 00:06:42.689 
we don't have enough it won't work it
won't<00:06:40.000> extend<00:06:40.449> properly<00:06:40.900> and<00:06:41.550> that's<00:06:42.550> not

00:06:42.689 --> 00:06:42.699 
won't extend properly and that's not

00:06:42.699 --> 00:06:44.189 
won't extend properly and that's not
what<00:06:43.000> we<00:06:43.060> want<00:06:43.389> so<00:06:43.570> if<00:06:43.720> you<00:06:43.840> are<00:06:43.960> extending

00:06:44.189 --> 00:06:44.199 
what we want so if you are extending

00:06:44.199 --> 00:06:47.540 
what we want so if you are extending
this<00:06:44.470> to<00:06:44.650> more<00:06:44.830> than<00:06:44.860> about<00:06:45.099> four<00:06:45.520> I<00:06:45.870> recommend

00:06:47.540 --> 00:06:47.550 
this to more than about four I recommend

00:06:47.550 --> 00:06:50.610 
this to more than about four I recommend
just<00:06:48.550> place<00:06:48.789> repeaters<00:06:49.660> pointing<00:06:50.289> into<00:06:50.500> all

00:06:50.610 --> 00:06:50.620 
just place repeaters pointing into all

00:06:50.620 --> 00:06:53.760 
just place repeaters pointing into all
of<00:06:50.650> all<00:06:51.340> of<00:06:51.520> the<00:06:51.610> ones<00:06:51.789> you<00:06:51.970> have<00:06:52.180> and<00:06:52.539> then<00:06:53.530> a

00:06:53.760 --> 00:06:53.770 
of all of the ones you have and then a

00:06:53.770 --> 00:07:00.920 
of all of the ones you have and then a
nice<00:06:54.039> simple<00:06:55.080> slab<00:06:56.080> tower<00:06:58.560> like<00:06:59.560> that<00:06:59.800> and

00:07:00.920 --> 00:07:00.930 
nice simple slab tower like that and

00:07:00.930 --> 00:07:03.750 
nice simple slab tower like that and
then<00:07:01.930> just<00:07:02.199> copy<00:07:02.590> that<00:07:02.860> up<00:07:03.010> and<00:07:03.250> you<00:07:03.490> can<00:07:03.610> place

00:07:03.750 --> 00:07:03.760 
then just copy that up and you can place

00:07:03.760 --> 00:07:06.000 
then just copy that up and you can place
your<00:07:03.880> inputs<00:07:04.270> at<00:07:04.360> the<00:07:04.479> bottom<00:07:04.840> and<00:07:05.560> the<00:07:05.830> whole

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:06.010 
your inputs at the bottom and the whole

00:07:06.010 --> 00:07:08.070 
your inputs at the bottom and the whole
thing<00:07:06.400> should<00:07:07.000> work<00:07:07.210> nicely<00:07:07.389> the<00:07:07.720> one<00:07:07.840> problem

00:07:08.070 --> 00:07:08.080 
thing should work nicely the one problem

00:07:08.080 --> 00:07:10.439 
thing should work nicely the one problem
you<00:07:08.229> do<00:07:08.349> run<00:07:08.530> into<00:07:08.560> is<00:07:09.070> when<00:07:09.310> your<00:07:09.849> slabs<00:07:10.210> run

00:07:10.439 --> 00:07:10.449 
you do run into is when your slabs run

00:07:10.449 --> 00:07:12.050 
you do run into is when your slabs run
out<00:07:10.570> of<00:07:10.599> power<00:07:10.810> then<00:07:11.110> you<00:07:11.199> can<00:07:11.349> simply

00:07:12.050 --> 00:07:12.060 
out of power then you can simply

00:07:12.060 --> 00:07:18.420 
out of power then you can simply
repeater<00:07:13.060> and<00:07:14.699> carry<00:07:15.699> this<00:07:15.849> on<00:07:16.620> however<00:07:17.620> far

00:07:18.420 --> 00:07:18.430 
repeater and carry this on however far

00:07:18.430 --> 00:07:23.399 
repeater and carry this on however far
you<00:07:18.990> want<00:07:20.789> like<00:07:21.789> that<00:07:22.090> and<00:07:22.840> you<00:07:23.020> can<00:07:23.139> just<00:07:23.229> keep

00:07:23.399 --> 00:07:23.409 
you want like that and you can just keep

00:07:23.409 --> 00:07:25.980 
you want like that and you can just keep
on<00:07:23.650> going<00:07:24.030> upwards<00:07:25.030> the<00:07:25.270> sky<00:07:25.570> is<00:07:25.630> the<00:07:25.840> limit

00:07:25.980 --> 00:07:25.990 
on going upwards the sky is the limit

00:07:25.990 --> 00:07:29.490 
on going upwards the sky is the limit
remember<00:07:26.740> actually<00:07:27.090> 256<00:07:28.090> is<00:07:28.240> the<00:07:28.360> limit<00:07:28.630> but<00:07:29.470> I

00:07:29.490 --> 00:07:29.500 
remember actually 256 is the limit but I

00:07:29.500 --> 00:07:31.260 
remember actually 256 is the limit but I
guess<00:07:29.770> I've<00:07:29.949> rambled<00:07:30.159> on<00:07:30.400> enough<00:07:30.760> for<00:07:31.060> this

00:07:31.260 --> 00:07:31.270 
guess I've rambled on enough for this

00:07:31.270 --> 00:07:33.839 
guess I've rambled on enough for this
video<00:07:31.720> so<00:07:32.409> as<00:07:32.740> I<00:07:32.889> said<00:07:32.949> if<00:07:33.310> you<00:07:33.430> do<00:07:33.610> have<00:07:33.820> any

video so as I said if you do have any

00:07:33.849 --> 00:07:35.460 
video so as I said if you do have any
requests<00:07:34.539> feel<00:07:34.750> free<00:07:34.990> just<00:07:35.020> to<00:07:35.289> leave<00:07:35.409> a
