that I could be for a female dog or a
male<00:00:32.989> but<00:00:33.989> I'm<00:00:34.200> on<00:00:34.380> the<00:00:34.500> female<00:00:34.860> side<00:00:34.920> and

male but I'm on the female side and

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:38.150 
male but I'm on the female side and
here's<00:00:36.630> a<00:00:36.719> pattern<00:00:37.260> i<00:00:37.380> think<00:00:37.590> it's<00:00:37.739> really

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:38.160 
here's a pattern i think it's really

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:40.750 
here's a pattern i think it's really
really<00:00:38.370> cute<00:00:38.579> and<00:00:38.790> in<00:00:39.450> the<00:00:39.600> back<00:00:39.809> it<00:00:40.140> just<00:00:40.350> has

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
buttons on the sides and i think that

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:48.170 
buttons on the sides and i think that
the<00:00:44.820> buttons<00:00:45.120> are<00:00:45.270> really<00:00:45.600> cute<00:00:46.910> they<00:00:47.910> say

like Martha Stewart I thought that was
really<00:00:50.129> cute<00:00:50.600> so<00:00:51.600> that's<00:00:51.750> the<00:00:51.899> first<00:00:52.079> thing<00:00:52.199> I

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
really cute so that's the first thing I

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:57.170 
really cute so that's the first thing I
got<00:00:52.590> and<00:00:52.860> on<00:00:53.670> it<00:00:54.360> was<00:00:54.629> originally<00:00:55.440> 90<00:00:56.219> 99<00:00:56.430> but

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 
got and on it was originally 90 99 but

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:00.049 
got and on it was originally 90 99 but
they<00:00:57.899> marked<00:00:58.230> it<00:00:58.289> down<00:00:58.350> to<00:00:58.500> 987<00:00:59.399> which<00:00:59.879> is

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
they marked it down to 987 which is

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:02.479 
they marked it down to 987 which is
really<00:01:00.300> good<00:01:00.539> because<00:01:00.680> if<00:01:01.680> not<00:01:02.010> I<00:01:02.070> probably

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489

would<00:01:45.810> have<00:01:45.990> enough<00:01:46.259> money<00:01:46.439> because<00:01:46.770> i<00:01:46.829> only

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:46.950 
would have enough money because i only

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:50.420 
would have enough money because i only
have<00:01:47.189> fifteen<00:01:47.549> dollars<00:01:47.970> and<00:01:48.979> so<00:01:49.979> that's<00:01:50.130> why<00:01:50.399> i

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100 
didn't get like a big one but um next

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:58.639
