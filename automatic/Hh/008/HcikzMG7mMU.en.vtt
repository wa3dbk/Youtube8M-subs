battery now it may seem pretty silly to
you<00:00:30.369> for<00:00:30.640> me<00:00:30.699> to<00:00:30.789> be<00:00:30.880> talking<00:00:31.029> about<00:00:31.890> testing

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:32.890 
you for me to be talking about testing

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:34.710 
you for me to be talking about testing
batteries<00:00:33.370> because<00:00:33.790> everybody<00:00:34.330> knows<00:00:34.510> how<00:00:34.660> to

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:34.720 
batteries because everybody knows how to

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:36.479 
batteries because everybody knows how to
do<00:00:34.870> that<00:00:35.080> right<00:00:35.350> you<00:00:35.620> just<00:00:36.040> grab<00:00:36.220> your

00:00:36.479 --> 00:00:36.489 
do that right you just grab your

00:00:36.489 --> 00:00:41.729 
do that right you just grab your
multimeter<00:00:38.160> put<00:00:39.160> it<00:00:39.280> on<00:00:39.400> volts<00:00:40.210> and<00:00:40.739> check

00:00:41.729 --> 00:00:41.739 
multimeter put it on volts and check

00:00:41.739 --> 00:00:44.430 
multimeter put it on volts and check
your<00:00:41.920> battery<00:00:42.250> right<00:00:42.630> so<00:00:43.630> I'll<00:00:43.930> see<00:00:44.200> you<00:00:44.230> I'll

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:44.440 
your battery right so I'll see you I'll

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:46.500 
your battery right so I'll see you I'll
put<00:00:44.649> it<00:00:44.739> on<00:00:44.890> this<00:00:45.370> power<00:00:45.730> cell<00:00:46.210> right<00:00:46.450> here

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:46.510 
put it on this power cell right here

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:48.799 
put it on this power cell right here
that<00:00:47.469> must<00:00:47.590> mean<00:00:47.680> it's<00:00:47.800> packed<00:00:48.250> with<00:00:48.370> power

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:48.809 
that must mean it's packed with power

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:51.030 
that must mean it's packed with power
actually<00:00:49.809> means<00:00:49.960> it's<00:00:50.110> heavy<00:00:50.260> duty<00:00:50.440> it's<00:00:50.710> crap

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:51.040 
actually means it's heavy duty it's crap

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:55.049 
actually means it's heavy duty it's crap
but<00:00:51.550> anyway<00:00:52.059> this'n<00:00:52.690> says<00:00:52.899> 9.0<00:00:53.710> nine<00:00:53.920> volts<00:00:54.340> so

00:00:55.049 --> 00:00:55.059 
but anyway this'n says 9.0 nine volts so

00:00:55.059 --> 00:00:59.250 
but anyway this'n says 9.0 nine volts so
obviously<00:00:55.899> it's<00:00:56.440> good<00:00:56.680> right<00:00:57.300> well<00:00:58.300> no<00:00:58.840> this

00:00:59.250 --> 00:00:59.260 
obviously it's good right well no this

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:01.350 
obviously it's good right well no this
battery<00:00:59.649> is<00:00:59.680> bad<00:00:59.920> you<00:01:00.730> can't<00:01:01.000> just<00:01:01.180> use<00:01:01.329> a

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:01.360 
battery is bad you can't just use a

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:04.350 
battery is bad you can't just use a
multimeter<00:01:02.140> to<00:01:02.410> test<00:01:02.620> batteries<00:01:03.280> and<00:01:03.520> I'm

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:04.360 
multimeter to test batteries and I'm

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:08.910 
multimeter to test batteries and I'm
going<00:01:04.509> to<00:01:04.570> describe<00:01:04.839> why<00:01:05.379> that<00:01:05.619> is<00:01:07.920> this

00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:08.920 
going to describe why that is this

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:11.400 
going to describe why that is this
battery<00:01:09.340> is<00:01:09.369> bad<00:01:09.670> and<00:01:09.970> this<00:01:10.810> battery<00:01:11.229> over

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:11.410 
battery is bad and this battery over

00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:14.030 
battery is bad and this battery over
here<00:01:11.860> is<00:01:12.070> brand<00:01:12.549> new<00:01:12.670> in<00:01:12.970> the<00:01:13.030> package<00:01:13.330> and

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040 
here is brand new in the package and

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:17.039 
here is brand new in the package and
this<00:01:15.040> one<00:01:15.220> should<00:01:15.640> be<00:01:15.790> good<00:01:16.030> it<00:01:16.540> will<00:01:16.689> probably

00:01:17.039 --> 00:01:17.049 
this one should be good it will probably

00:01:17.049 --> 00:01:19.469 
this one should be good it will probably
read<00:01:17.229> a<00:01:17.409> slightly<00:01:17.770> higher<00:01:18.070> voltage<00:01:18.580> because

00:01:19.469 --> 00:01:19.479 
read a slightly higher voltage because

00:01:19.479 --> 00:01:23.340 
read a slightly higher voltage because
it<00:01:19.600> is<00:01:19.780> brand<00:01:20.080> new<00:01:20.670> 9.8<00:01:21.670> volts<00:01:22.060> but<00:01:22.990> that's<00:01:23.170> not

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:23.350 
it is brand new 9.8 volts but that's not

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:24.780 
it is brand new 9.8 volts but that's not
the<00:01:23.470> reason<00:01:23.590> that<00:01:23.710> this<00:01:23.890> battery<00:01:24.250> is<00:01:24.280> good<00:01:24.490> and

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:24.790 
the reason that this battery is good and

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:27.060 
the reason that this battery is good and
this<00:01:24.909> one<00:01:25.060> is<00:01:25.240> bad<00:01:25.479> there<00:01:26.170> are<00:01:26.409> two<00:01:26.799> parameters

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:27.070 
this one is bad there are two parameters

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:29.999 
this one is bad there are two parameters
in<00:01:27.729> a<00:01:28.180> battery<00:01:28.630> that<00:01:28.750> describe<00:01:29.320> whether<00:01:29.590> it<00:01:29.860> is

00:01:29.999 --> 00:01:30.009 
in a battery that describe whether it is

00:01:30.009 --> 00:01:32.130 
in a battery that describe whether it is
good<00:01:30.220> or<00:01:30.490> not<00:01:30.520> and<00:01:31.090> it<00:01:31.659> depends<00:01:31.990> on<00:01:32.020> the

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:32.140 
good or not and it depends on the

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:32.850 
good or not and it depends on the
application

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:32.860 
application

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:35.789 
application
one<00:01:33.670> is<00:01:33.939> the<00:01:34.180> voltage<00:01:34.299> it<00:01:35.020> has<00:01:35.259> to<00:01:35.439> have<00:01:35.560> enough

00:01:35.789 --> 00:01:35.799 
one is the voltage it has to have enough

00:01:35.799 --> 00:01:39.450 
one is the voltage it has to have enough
voltage<00:01:36.130> to<00:01:36.400> drive<00:01:36.640> your<00:01:37.090> load<00:01:37.710> two<00:01:38.710> it<00:01:39.040> has<00:01:39.430> to

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:39.460 
voltage to drive your load two it has to

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:41.310 
voltage to drive your load two it has to
have<00:01:39.729> a<00:01:39.759> low<00:01:40.090> enough<00:01:40.210> internal<00:01:40.720> resistance

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:41.320 
have a low enough internal resistance

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:43.620 
have a low enough internal resistance
this<00:01:42.159> battery<00:01:42.549> may<00:01:42.820> work<00:01:43.030> okay<00:01:43.390> if<00:01:43.479> you're

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:43.630 
this battery may work okay if you're

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:45.120 
this battery may work okay if you're
just<00:01:43.750> running<00:01:43.930> a<00:01:44.140> digital<00:01:44.560> watch<00:01:44.799> or

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:45.130 
just running a digital watch or

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:47.190 
just running a digital watch or
something<00:01:45.490> of<00:01:45.610> that<00:01:45.640> nature<00:01:45.790> but<00:01:46.780> this<00:01:46.900> was<00:01:47.079> in

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:47.200 
something of that nature but this was in

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:49.469 
something of that nature but this was in
a<00:01:47.259> smoke<00:01:47.500> alarm<00:01:47.530> and<00:01:47.950> smoke<00:01:48.670> alarm<00:01:49.000> when<00:01:49.390> it

it has failed internally and it no

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:08.850 
it has failed internally and it no
longer<00:02:05.530> works<00:02:06.570> and<00:02:07.570> for<00:02:08.410> that<00:02:08.500> reason<00:02:08.829> you

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:08.860 
longer works and for that reason you

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:11.819 
longer works and for that reason you
can't<00:02:09.160> just<00:02:09.310> use<00:02:09.519> a<00:02:09.729> multimeter<00:02:10.239> now<00:02:11.079> there<00:02:11.709> is

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:11.829 
can't just use a multimeter now there is

00:02:11.829 --> 00:02:13.440 
can't just use a multimeter now there is
a<00:02:11.860> really<00:02:12.220> simple<00:02:12.370> way<00:02:12.610> you<00:02:12.670> can<00:02:12.880> do<00:02:12.970> this<00:02:13.180> if

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:13.450 
a really simple way you can do this if

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:15.360 
a really simple way you can do this if
you<00:02:13.570> have<00:02:13.600> for<00:02:14.230> example<00:02:14.320> this<00:02:15.100> flashlight

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:15.370 
you have for example this flashlight

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:17.970 
you have for example this flashlight
here<00:02:15.819> takes<00:02:16.090> triple-a<00:02:16.569> batteries<00:02:17.020> I<00:02:17.200> know

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:17.980 
here takes triple-a batteries I know

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:19.540 
here takes triple-a batteries I know
that<00:02:18.220> this<00:02:18.370> light<00:02:18.550> works

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:19.550 
that this light works

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:21.640 
that this light works
and<00:02:19.640> I<00:02:20.090> can<00:02:20.270> just<00:02:20.450> put<00:02:20.810> in<00:02:20.930> three<00:02:21.260> Triple<00:02:21.560> A

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:21.650 
and I can just put in three Triple A

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:23.920 
and I can just put in three Triple A
batteries<00:02:21.680> and<00:02:22.310> if<00:02:23.030> this<00:02:23.240> light<00:02:23.300> works<00:02:23.690> well

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:23.930 
batteries and if this light works well

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:25.570 
batteries and if this light works well
then<00:02:24.230> I<00:02:24.350> know<00:02:24.410> the<00:02:24.680> batteries<00:02:25.010> are<00:02:25.130> good<00:02:25.280> and

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:25.580 
then I know the batteries are good and

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:27.370 
then I know the batteries are good and
that<00:02:26.120> really<00:02:26.330> is<00:02:26.510> a<00:02:26.540> valid<00:02:26.900> way<00:02:27.020> to<00:02:27.050> test

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:27.380 
that really is a valid way to test

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:29.710 
that really is a valid way to test
batteries<00:02:27.860> but<00:02:28.130> it's<00:02:28.790> not<00:02:29.060> a<00:02:29.240> very<00:02:29.510> scientific

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:29.720 
batteries but it's not a very scientific

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:31.780 
batteries but it's not a very scientific
way<00:02:30.260> and<00:02:30.560> it's<00:02:30.950> not<00:02:31.040> a<00:02:31.190> way<00:02:31.370> to<00:02:31.430> test<00:02:31.670> them

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:31.790 
way and it's not a way to test them

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:34.630 
way and it's not a way to test them
individually<00:02:32.170> so<00:02:33.170> there<00:02:33.620> is<00:02:33.770> a<00:02:33.800> better<00:02:34.310> way

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:34.640 
individually so there is a better way

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:37.810 
individually so there is a better way
now<00:02:35.200> I<00:02:36.200> can<00:02:36.530> go<00:02:36.650> through<00:02:36.680> here<00:02:37.130> and<00:02:37.160> test<00:02:37.550> each

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:37.820 
now I can go through here and test each

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:39.280 
now I can go through here and test each
one<00:02:38.030> of<00:02:38.120> these<00:02:38.210> batteries<00:02:38.690> and<00:02:38.990> make<00:02:39.140> sure

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:39.290 
one of these batteries and make sure

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:42.460 
one of these batteries and make sure
they're<00:02:39.440> good<00:02:39.850> but<00:02:40.850> and<00:02:41.090> this<00:02:42.050> apparently

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:42.470 
they're good but and this apparently

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:43.930 
they're good but and this apparently
isn't<00:02:42.710> or<00:02:43.100> am<00:02:43.310> I<00:02:43.370> just<00:02:43.400> having<00:02:43.760> a<00:02:43.820> bad

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:43.940 
isn't or am I just having a bad

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:46.210 
isn't or am I just having a bad
connection<00:02:44.210> here<00:02:44.420> oh<00:02:44.690> there<00:02:44.870> we<00:02:44.960> are<00:02:44.990> so<00:02:45.920> I<00:02:45.950> can

00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:46.220 
connection here oh there we are so I can

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:47.620 
connection here oh there we are so I can
go<00:02:46.400> through<00:02:46.640> here<00:02:46.850> and<00:02:46.880> test<00:02:47.240> all<00:02:47.390> of<00:02:47.510> these

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:47.630 
go through here and test all of these

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:48.790 
go through here and test all of these
batteries<00:02:48.020> I<00:02:48.140> think<00:02:48.350> they<00:02:48.470> should<00:02:48.650> all<00:02:48.740> be

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:48.800 
batteries I think they should all be

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:51.610 
batteries I think they should all be
good<00:02:49.210> but<00:02:50.210> this<00:02:50.810> doesn't<00:02:51.110> really<00:02:51.290> tell<00:02:51.560> me

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:51.620 
good but this doesn't really tell me

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:55.780 
good but this doesn't really tell me
they're<00:02:52.310> good<00:02:52.550> or<00:02:52.790> not<00:02:53.090> as<00:02:53.990> I<00:02:54.800> described<00:02:55.280> this

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:55.790 
they're good or not as I described this

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:57.790 
they're good or not as I described this
is<00:02:56.000> only<00:02:56.150> telling<00:02:56.360> me<00:02:56.480> the<00:02:56.630> voltage<00:02:56.990> not<00:02:57.620> the

00:02:57.790 --> 00:02:57.800 
is only telling me the voltage not the

00:02:57.800 --> 00:02:59.620 
is only telling me the voltage not the
internal<00:02:58.160> resistance<00:02:58.640> and<00:02:58.880> this<00:02:59.330> here<00:02:59.540> is<00:02:59.600> a

00:02:59.620 --> 00:02:59.630 
internal resistance and this here is a

00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:00.910 
internal resistance and this here is a
NiCad<00:03:00.110> so<00:03:00.290> it's<00:03:00.410> going<00:03:00.530> to<00:03:00.590> read<00:03:00.710> a<00:03:00.740> lower

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:00.920 
NiCad so it's going to read a lower

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:04.420 
NiCad so it's going to read a lower
voltage<00:03:01.660> it's<00:03:02.660> a<00:03:02.810> discharge<00:03:03.050> NiCad<00:03:03.890> so<00:03:04.220> we're

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:04.430 
voltage it's a discharge NiCad so we're

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:05.770 
voltage it's a discharge NiCad so we're
just<00:03:04.460> going<00:03:04.700> to<00:03:04.790> chuck<00:03:04.970> that<00:03:05.000> one<00:03:05.270> aside<00:03:05.540> for

00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:05.780 
just going to chuck that one aside for

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:07.990 
just going to chuck that one aside for
now<00:03:05.900> this<00:03:06.650> came<00:03:06.920> out<00:03:07.040> of<00:03:07.190> a<00:03:07.310> solar<00:03:07.730> light

00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:08.000 
now this came out of a solar light

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.120 
now this came out of a solar light
outside<00:03:08.210> my<00:03:08.600> house<00:03:08.810> it<00:03:09.410> hasn't<00:03:09.590> been<00:03:09.830> charged

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:10.130 
outside my house it hasn't been charged

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:12.370 
outside my house it hasn't been charged
in<00:03:10.310> probably<00:03:10.700> a<00:03:10.730> year<00:03:10.790> and<00:03:11.030> a<00:03:11.060> half<00:03:11.210> so<00:03:11.540> it's<00:03:11.690> no

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:12.380 
in probably a year and a half so it's no

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:13.960 
in probably a year and a half so it's no
wonder<00:03:12.560> that<00:03:12.680> it's<00:03:12.920> dead<00:03:13.130> we'll<00:03:13.670> just<00:03:13.820> set

00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:13.970 
wonder that it's dead we'll just set

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:16.420 
wonder that it's dead we'll just set
that<00:03:14.120> aside<00:03:14.210> but<00:03:14.780> in<00:03:15.170> any<00:03:15.350> case<00:03:15.380> I'm<00:03:16.220> going<00:03:16.370> to

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:16.430 
that aside but in any case I'm going to

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:18.520 
that aside but in any case I'm going to
show<00:03:16.580> you<00:03:16.640> how<00:03:17.090> you<00:03:17.510> can<00:03:17.690> actually<00:03:17.960> test<00:03:18.350> these

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:18.530 
show you how you can actually test these

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:21.640 
show you how you can actually test these
batteries<00:03:18.980> with<00:03:19.730> a<00:03:19.760> multimeter<00:03:20.420> now<00:03:21.230> you<00:03:21.290> can

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:21.650 
batteries with a multimeter now you can

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:23.620 
batteries with a multimeter now you can
buy<00:03:21.860> a<00:03:22.070> battery<00:03:22.520> load<00:03:22.730> tester<00:03:23.150> they're<00:03:23.420> pretty

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:23.630 
buy a battery load tester they're pretty

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:24.880 
buy a battery load tester they're pretty
cheap<00:03:23.690> and<00:03:24.080> you<00:03:24.140> can<00:03:24.290> buy<00:03:24.380> them<00:03:24.530> just<00:03:24.590> about

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:24.890 
cheap and you can buy them just about

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:27.520 
cheap and you can buy them just about
anywhere<00:03:24.950> and<00:03:25.520> they<00:03:26.360> do<00:03:26.480> the<00:03:26.630> base<00:03:26.780> same<00:03:27.170> basic

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:27.530 
anywhere and they do the base same basic

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:29.470 
anywhere and they do the base same basic
procedure<00:03:27.920> as<00:03:28.220> I<00:03:28.550> am<00:03:28.640> going<00:03:28.850> to<00:03:28.940> do<00:03:29.060> here

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:29.480 
procedure as I am going to do here

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:31.449 
procedure as I am going to do here
they<00:03:29.840> just<00:03:29.990> integrate<00:03:30.410> it<00:03:30.530> inside<00:03:30.890> the<00:03:31.070> tester

00:03:31.449 --> 00:03:31.459 
they just integrate it inside the tester

00:03:31.459 --> 00:03:34.630 
they just integrate it inside the tester
and<00:03:32.080> to<00:03:33.080> properly<00:03:33.440> check<00:03:33.709> batteries<00:03:34.160> you<00:03:34.459> need

00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:34.640 
and to properly check batteries you need

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:37.510 
and to properly check batteries you need
both<00:03:34.850> a<00:03:35.120> voltage<00:03:35.570> meter<00:03:35.600> and<00:03:36.140> a<00:03:36.800> known<00:03:37.100> load

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:37.520 
both a voltage meter and a known load

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:39.430 
both a voltage meter and a known load
and<00:03:38.300> there's<00:03:38.570> lots<00:03:38.750> of<00:03:38.840> ways<00:03:38.930> to<00:03:39.110> get<00:03:39.200> a<00:03:39.260> known

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:39.440 
and there's lots of ways to get a known

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:42.580 
and there's lots of ways to get a known
load<00:03:39.709> I'm<00:03:40.250> going<00:03:40.580> to<00:03:40.670> use<00:03:40.820> this<00:03:41.270> method<00:03:41.540> I<00:03:41.990> have

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:42.590 
load I'm going to use this method I have

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:46.449 
load I'm going to use this method I have
this<00:03:42.800> aluminum<00:03:43.520> resistor<00:03:44.300> it's<00:03:45.050> about<00:03:45.459> 110

00:03:46.449 --> 00:03:46.459

through it for projects and whatnot but

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:12.670 
through it for projects and whatnot but
they're<00:04:10.580> just<00:04:10.700> quarter<00:04:11.120> ohm<00:04:11.470> carbon<00:04:12.470> film

and<00:04:19.209> probably<00:04:20.209> only<00:04:20.299> cost<00:04:20.480> you<00:04:20.660> a<00:04:20.690> few<00:04:20.840> cents

00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:21.140 
and probably only cost you a few cents

00:04:21.140 --> 00:04:23.830 
and probably only cost you a few cents
to<00:04:21.320> get<00:04:21.440> one<00:04:21.650> if<00:04:22.100> you<00:04:22.310> know<00:04:22.460> where<00:04:22.640> to<00:04:22.669> look<00:04:22.840> so

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:23.840 
to get one if you know where to look so

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:26.740 
to get one if you know where to look so
basically<00:04:24.530> what<00:04:25.250> I'm<00:04:25.370> going<00:04:25.610> to<00:04:25.640> do<00:04:25.850> is<00:04:26.060> take

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:26.750 
basically what I'm going to do is take

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:29.830 
basically what I'm going to do is take
my<00:04:26.900> resistor<00:04:27.380> here<00:04:27.680> and<00:04:27.830> I<00:04:28.669> need<00:04:29.000> to<00:04:29.180> load<00:04:29.630> down

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:29.840 
my resistor here and I need to load down

my resistor here and I need to load down
the<00:04:30.020> batteries<00:04:30.440> well<00:04:30.830> how<00:04:30.950> do<00:04:31.010> i<00:04:31.130> connect<00:04:31.400> this

00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:31.550 
the batteries well how do i connect this

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:32.770 
the batteries well how do i connect this
to<00:04:31.729> the<00:04:31.820> battery<00:04:32.180> right

00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:32.780 
to the battery right

00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:35.110

doesn't<00:04:33.230> really<00:04:33.350> fit<00:04:33.950> on<00:04:34.100> there<00:04:34.430> well<00:04:34.580> it's

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:35.120 
doesn't really fit on there well it's

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:37.990 
doesn't really fit on there well it's
pretty<00:04:35.480> easy<00:04:36.070> so<00:04:37.070> you<00:04:37.160> take<00:04:37.460> your<00:04:37.610> multimeter

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:38.000 
pretty easy so you take your multimeter

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:43.000 
pretty easy so you take your multimeter

00:04:57.070 --> 00:04:57.080 
resistor and connect it to my other

00:04:57.080 --> 00:05:01.570 
resistor and connect it to my other
probe<00:04:57.730> now<00:04:58.730> I<00:04:58.790> have<00:04:59.240> these<00:04:59.960> probes<00:05:00.580> connected

00:05:01.570 --> 00:05:01.580 
probe now I have these probes connected

is new out of the package it should be

00:05:11.750 --> 00:05:17.040 
is new out of the package it should be
good<00:05:11.930> and<00:05:12.230> we'll<00:05:13.220> see<00:05:13.370> what<00:05:13.490> this<00:05:13.610> and<00:05:13.760> reads

eight<00:05:18.050> point<00:05:18.350> nine<00:05:18.470> six<00:05:18.680> volts<00:05:19.130> it<00:05:19.370> will<00:05:19.580> read

00:05:19.780 --> 00:05:19.790 
eight point nine six volts it will read

00:05:19.790 --> 00:05:21.250 
eight point nine six volts it will read
a<00:05:19.820> little<00:05:20.060> bit<00:05:20.240> lower<00:05:20.420> because<00:05:20.720> it's<00:05:21.050> being

00:05:21.250 --> 00:05:21.260 
a little bit lower because it's being

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:24.730 
a little bit lower because it's being
drawn<00:05:21.920> down<00:05:21.950> by<00:05:22.190> a<00:05:22.460> 100<00:05:23.180> ohm<00:05:23.270> load<00:05:23.560> but<00:05:24.560> that's

00:05:24.730 --> 00:05:24.740 
drawn down by a 100 ohm load but that's

00:05:24.740 --> 00:05:26.950 
drawn down by a 100 ohm load but that's
still<00:05:25.010> good<00:05:25.220> it's<00:05:25.640> about<00:05:25.790> nine<00:05:26.030> volts<00:05:26.419> we'll

00:05:26.950 --> 00:05:26.960 
still good it's about nine volts we'll

00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:28.690 
still good it's about nine volts we'll
try<00:05:27.230> this<00:05:27.560> 9-volt<00:05:28.010> battery<00:05:28.340> the<00:05:28.460> one<00:05:28.580> that

00:05:28.690 --> 00:05:28.700 
try this 9-volt battery the one that

00:05:28.700 --> 00:05:30.520 
try this 9-volt battery the one that
tested<00:05:29.030> over<00:05:29.360> nine<00:05:29.540> volts<00:05:29.870> before<00:05:30.169> open

00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:30.530 
tested over nine volts before open

00:05:30.530 --> 00:05:33.670 
tested over nine volts before open
circuit<00:05:30.890> and<00:05:31.750> now<00:05:32.750> you<00:05:32.810> can<00:05:32.990> see<00:05:33.169> under<00:05:33.440> load

00:05:33.670 --> 00:05:33.680

00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:40.180 
it's only two point seven volts very
clearly<00:05:37.640> bad<00:05:38.110> so<00:05:39.110> this<00:05:39.320> battery<00:05:39.740> even<00:05:39.950> though

00:05:40.180 --> 00:05:40.190 
clearly bad so this battery even though

it tested good open circuit on a
multimeter<00:05:42.020> is<00:05:42.290> no<00:05:42.919> good<00:05:43.160> and<00:05:43.400> I<00:05:43.790> can<00:05:43.940> just

00:05:44.020 --> 00:05:44.030 
multimeter is no good and I can just

00:05:44.030 --> 00:05:47.140 
multimeter is no good and I can just
chuck<00:05:44.210> that<00:05:44.270> away<00:05:44.630> because<00:05:45.200> it<00:05:45.560> is<00:05:45.830> bad<00:05:46.220> now

00:05:47.140 --> 00:05:47.150 
chuck that away because it is bad now

00:05:47.150 --> 00:05:48.670 
chuck that away because it is bad now
the<00:05:47.210> rest<00:05:47.510> of<00:05:47.600> these<00:05:47.690> batteries<00:05:48.140> I<00:05:48.320> can<00:05:48.470> do<00:05:48.560> the

00:05:48.670 --> 00:05:48.680 
the rest of these batteries I can do the

00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:54.400 
the rest of these batteries I can do the
same<00:05:48.860> thing<00:05:49.160> with<00:05:51.910> 1.5<00:05:52.910> volts<00:05:53.330> that<00:05:54.200> one's

00:05:54.400 --> 00:05:54.410 
same thing with 1.5 volts that one's

00:05:54.410 --> 00:06:02.850 
same thing with 1.5 volts that one's
good<00:05:54.680> check<00:05:55.640> this<00:05:55.790> one<00:05:57.490> 1.5<00:05:58.490> that<00:05:58.880> one's<00:05:59.030> good

00:06:02.850 --> 00:06:02.860 

00:06:02.860 --> 00:06:05.070 

I'm<00:06:03.520> going<00:06:03.820> for<00:06:04.060> the<00:06:04.450> since<00:06:04.630> may<00:06:04.780> be<00:06:04.840> a<00:06:04.900> little

00:06:05.070 --> 00:06:05.080 
I'm going for the since may be a little

00:06:05.080 --> 00:06:10.520 
I'm going for the since may be a little
bit<00:06:05.230> weak<00:06:05.470> but<00:06:05.500> I'm<00:06:05.860> going<00:06:05.980> to<00:06:06.040> keep<00:06:06.190> it<00:06:08.070> and

00:06:10.520 --> 00:06:10.530 
bit weak but I'm going to keep it and

00:06:10.530 --> 00:06:13.590 
bit weak but I'm going to keep it and
1.5<00:06:11.530> so<00:06:12.250> out<00:06:12.370> of<00:06:12.490> curiosity<00:06:12.790> I'm<00:06:13.240> just<00:06:13.420> going

00:06:13.590 --> 00:06:13.600 
1.5 so out of curiosity I'm just going

00:06:13.600 --> 00:06:15.480 
1.5 so out of curiosity I'm just going
to<00:06:13.660> see<00:06:13.870> what<00:06:14.140> this<00:06:14.260> one<00:06:14.440> is<00:06:14.470> open<00:06:15.010> circuit<00:06:15.340> and

00:06:15.480 --> 00:06:15.490 
to see what this one is open circuit and

00:06:15.490 --> 00:06:18.390 
to see what this one is open circuit and
closed<00:06:16.120> circuit<00:06:16.440> one<00:06:17.440> point<00:06:17.680> four<00:06:17.950> to<00:06:18.100> six

00:06:18.390 --> 00:06:18.400 
closed circuit one point four to six

00:06:18.400 --> 00:06:20.610 
closed circuit one point four to six
volts<00:06:18.730> I'm<00:06:19.330> going<00:06:19.570> to<00:06:19.630> take<00:06:19.720> my<00:06:19.870> load<00:06:20.050> off<00:06:20.350> and

00:06:20.610 --> 00:06:20.620 
volts I'm going to take my load off and

00:06:20.620 --> 00:06:26.960 
volts I'm going to take my load off and
test<00:06:21.490> it<00:06:21.670> again<00:06:24.330> one<00:06:25.330> point<00:06:25.570> four<00:06:25.750> three<00:06:25.960> seven

00:06:26.960 --> 00:06:26.970 
test it again one point four three seven

00:06:26.970 --> 00:06:30.120 
test it again one point four three seven
so<00:06:27.970> this<00:06:28.090> battery<00:06:28.480> is<00:06:28.510> still<00:06:28.930> good<00:06:29.230> but<00:06:29.740> its

00:06:30.120 --> 00:06:30.130 
so this battery is still good but its

00:06:30.130 --> 00:06:32.610 
so this battery is still good but its
capacity<00:06:30.730> has<00:06:30.880> decreased<00:06:31.330> probably<00:06:32.320> because

00:06:32.610 --> 00:06:32.620 
capacity has decreased probably because

00:06:32.620 --> 00:06:35.430 
capacity has decreased probably because
it<00:06:32.770> says<00:06:33.010> used<00:06:33.490> by<00:06:33.670> December<00:06:34.210> 2011<00:06:34.750> on<00:06:35.140> it<00:06:35.260> and

00:06:35.430 --> 00:06:35.440 
it says used by December 2011 on it and

00:06:35.440 --> 00:06:38.190 
it says used by December 2011 on it and
it's<00:06:36.160> now<00:06:36.460> about<00:06:36.730> two<00:06:37.150> years<00:06:37.390> past<00:06:37.750> that<00:06:38.020> date

00:06:38.190 --> 00:06:38.200 
it's now about two years past that date

00:06:38.200 --> 00:06:39.960 
it's now about two years past that date
I've<00:06:38.500> had<00:06:38.740> this<00:06:38.860> in<00:06:39.010> storage<00:06:39.250> for<00:06:39.490> a<00:06:39.520> long<00:06:39.730> time

00:06:39.960 --> 00:06:39.970 
I've had this in storage for a long time

00:06:39.970 --> 00:06:42.000 
I've had this in storage for a long time
it's<00:06:40.660> still<00:06:40.840> a<00:06:40.870> good<00:06:41.050> battery<00:06:41.290> but<00:06:41.650> it's<00:06:41.830> not

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:42.010 
it's still a good battery but it's not

00:06:42.010 --> 00:06:44.190 
it's still a good battery but it's not
as<00:06:42.160> fresh<00:06:42.460> as<00:06:42.670> it<00:06:42.700> could<00:06:42.940> be<00:06:43.090> the<00:06:43.900> rest<00:06:44.020> of

00:06:44.190 --> 00:06:44.200 
as fresh as it could be the rest of

00:06:44.200 --> 00:06:46.560 
as fresh as it could be the rest of
these<00:06:44.290> are<00:06:44.530> all<00:06:44.620> in<00:06:44.950> great<00:06:45.160> shape<00:06:45.400> this<00:06:46.180> one<00:06:46.390> is

00:06:46.560 --> 00:06:46.570 
these are all in great shape this one is

00:06:46.570 --> 00:06:49.200 
these are all in great shape this one is
bad<00:06:46.960> and<00:06:47.280> that's<00:06:48.280> just<00:06:48.460> a<00:06:48.520> quick<00:06:48.640> video<00:06:48.940> on<00:06:49.000> how

00:06:49.200 --> 00:06:49.210 
bad and that's just a quick video on how

00:06:49.210 --> 00:06:52.470 
bad and that's just a quick video on how
to<00:06:49.420> properly<00:06:49.930> check<00:06:50.470> a<00:06:50.680> standard<00:06:51.340> battery<00:06:51.760> for

00:06:52.470 --> 00:06:52.480 
to properly check a standard battery for

00:06:52.480 --> 00:06:55.380 
to properly check a standard battery for
proper<00:06:53.320> function<00:06:53.760> you<00:06:54.760> can't<00:06:55.030> just<00:06:55.210> take<00:06:55.330> a

00:06:55.380 --> 00:06:55.390 
proper function you can't just take a

00:06:55.390 --> 00:06:58.110 
proper function you can't just take a
multimeter<00:06:55.960> and<00:06:56.170> check<00:06:56.980> your<00:06:57.130> battery<00:06:57.460> that

00:06:58.110 --> 00:06:58.120 
multimeter and check your battery that

00:06:58.120 --> 00:06:59.400 
multimeter and check your battery that
won't<00:06:58.270> tell<00:06:58.450> you<00:06:58.540> if<00:06:58.600> it's<00:06:58.720> good<00:06:58.870> or<00:06:58.900> not<00:06:59.020> you

00:06:59.400 --> 00:06:59.410 
won't tell you if it's good or not you

00:06:59.410 --> 00:07:01.710 
won't tell you if it's good or not you
need<00:06:59.590> to<00:06:59.680> have<00:06:59.860> a<00:07:00.070> load<00:07:00.310> of<00:07:00.490> some<00:07:00.640> sort<00:07:00.940> you<00:07:01.600> can

00:07:01.710 --> 00:07:01.720 
need to have a load of some sort you can

00:07:01.720 --> 00:07:03.060 
need to have a load of some sort you can
use<00:07:01.810> a<00:07:01.840> resistor<00:07:02.290> like<00:07:02.410> this<00:07:02.620> or<00:07:02.800> anything

00:07:03.060 --> 00:07:03.070 
use a resistor like this or anything

00:07:03.070 --> 00:07:06.180 
use a resistor like this or anything
that's<00:07:03.310> about<00:07:03.610> 100<00:07:04.150> ohms<00:07:04.440> so<00:07:05.440> thanks<00:07:06.100> for

00:07:06.180 --> 00:07:06.190 
that's about 100 ohms so thanks for

00:07:06.190 --> 00:07:08.550 
that's about 100 ohms so thanks for
watching
