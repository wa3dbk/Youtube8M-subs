00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:07.280 
like a six month period of development

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:09.649 
like a six month period of development
so<00:01:08.280> even<00:01:08.820> though<00:01:08.850> it<00:01:09.090> didn't<00:01:09.330> really<00:01:09.420> change

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 
so even though it didn't really change

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:12.230 
so even though it didn't really change
much<00:01:09.900> of<00:01:10.080> the<00:01:10.140> game<00:01:10.470> it<00:01:10.920> did<00:01:11.250> add<00:01:11.490> a<00:01:11.520> lot<00:01:12.000> new

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
much of the game it did add a lot new

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:14.270 
much of the game it did add a lot new
world<00:01:12.450> generation<00:01:12.840> in<00:01:13.110> 1.7<00:01:13.830> which<00:01:13.920> is<00:01:14.100> why

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
world generation in 1.7 which is why

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:16.190 
world generation in 1.7 which is why
it's<00:01:14.490> called<00:01:14.700> the<00:01:15.210> update<00:01:15.659> that<00:01:15.810> changed<00:01:16.170> the

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
it's called the update that changed the

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:18.469 
it's called the update that changed the
world<00:01:16.290> so<00:01:16.950> that<00:01:17.070> took<00:01:17.220> about<00:01:17.400> six<00:01:17.850> months<00:01:18.150> to

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
world so that took about six months to

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:20.450 
world so that took about six months to
make<00:01:18.689> okay<00:01:19.020> let's<00:01:19.680> keep<00:01:19.860> that<00:01:19.979> in<00:01:20.100> mind<00:01:20.189> six

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 
make okay let's keep that in mind six

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:22.990 
make okay let's keep that in mind six
months<00:01:20.700> now<00:01:21.689> if<00:01:22.200> we're<00:01:22.320> going<00:01:22.409> to<00:01:22.470> compare<00:01:22.860> the

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:23.000 
months now if we're going to compare the

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.420 
months now if we're going to compare the
1.7<00:01:24.000> update<00:01:24.450> to<00:01:24.869> the<00:01:25.020> 1.8<00:01:25.770> Update<00:01:26.009> we're

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:26.430 
1.7 update to the 1.8 Update we're

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:30.999 
1.7 update to the 1.8 Update we're
starting<00:01:26.909> to<00:01:27.030> get<00:01:27.210> into<00:01:27.659> the<00:01:28.460> much<00:01:29.460> larger

00:01:30.999 --> 00:01:31.009 
starting to get into the much larger

00:01:31.009 --> 00:01:34.160 
starting to get into the much larger
longer<00:01:32.060> development<00:01:33.060> period<00:01:33.329> because<00:01:34.020> this

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.170 
longer development period because this

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:36.289 
longer development period because this
update<00:01:34.500> came<00:01:34.710> out<00:01:34.829> of<00:01:35.040> sit<00:01:35.280> in<00:01:35.400> September<00:01:36.180> of

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299 
update came out of sit in September of

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:40.429 
update came out of sit in September of
2014<00:01:37.290> so<00:01:37.799> this<00:01:37.950> is<00:01:38.159> actually<00:01:38.340> a<00:01:39.439> 10-month

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:40.439 
2014 so this is actually a 10-month

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:42.679 
2014 so this is actually a 10-month
development<00:01:41.100> cycle<00:01:41.520> for<00:01:41.759> this<00:01:41.909> update<00:01:42.119> so<00:01:42.570> we

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:42.689 
development cycle for this update so we

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:45.530 
development cycle for this update so we
went<00:01:42.840> just<00:01:43.200> from<00:01:43.470> six<00:01:43.920> months<00:01:44.340> to<00:01:44.670> 10<00:01:45.270> months

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:45.540 
went just from six months to 10 months

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:47.510 
went just from six months to 10 months
and<00:01:45.810> pretty<00:01:46.619> much<00:01:46.680> why<00:01:46.979> that<00:01:47.159> is<00:01:47.280> is<00:01:47.310> because

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
and pretty much why that is is because

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:49.850 
and pretty much why that is is because
there<00:01:47.759> are<00:01:47.820> a<00:01:47.850> ton<00:01:48.240> of<00:01:48.299> gameplay<00:01:49.229> in<00:01:49.439> general

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:49.860 
there are a ton of gameplay in general

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:52.130 
there are a ton of gameplay in general

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
changes including a lot of the backend

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:54.170 
changes including a lot of the backend
stuff<00:01:52.380> for<00:01:52.649> the<00:01:52.710> coding<00:01:53.189> behind<00:01:53.579> the<00:01:53.700> game<00:01:53.909> and
