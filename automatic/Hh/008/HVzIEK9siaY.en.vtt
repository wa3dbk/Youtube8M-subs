00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.049
 a pretty also his briefcase and for 

00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:05.670
 that's not some super nice idea and 

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:07.500
 flirty to carry in our chairs 

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:09.690
 if you want to learn how to do follow 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:11.670
 with the tutorial the first house 

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:13.410
 need is a white base that's 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:15.240
 white flame stove and put how many 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:17.670
 layers you need until you have one 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:19.830
 well concentrated color now I take a 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:22.830
 apple red was compassion so super 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:24.539
 vibrant and we're going to make the kisses with 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:26.400
 a fine tip brush we are going to paint 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:27.960
 two lines that come together in the center and 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:30.689
 after these two lines we will 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:33.480
 draw two more I imagine it as a 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:36.090
 M shape elongated or like two mountains 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:37.800
 united throughout the center as they could 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:39.450
 see on the bottom paint the lip 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:42.260
 inferior making a way for a 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:44.760
 elongated that unites the two ends of the m 

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:46.200
 always leave a blank space just 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:48.960
 in the center of the mouth to be 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:50.579
 see a lot sexier and we're going to repeat the 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:52.920
 procedure let's paint a small 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:55.020
 sees knows they will leave two other colitas 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:59.449
 that form an m in the bottom 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:59.449
 let's continue the elongated and fill 

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:09.490
 This design requires a bit of 

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:11.320
 patience because you have to paint one 

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:13.090
 for one the little kisses but I can 

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:14.560
 recommend that with your little finger you 

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:16.780
 give a support so that it is not so 

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:18.880
 difficult and try that your enamels are 

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:22.260
 rather liquid and not so thick for 

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:22.260
 everything flows much better 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:27.460
 the design already depends on your tastes 

00:01:25.869 --> 00:01:28.899
 because there are people who like it with 

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:30.970
 many kisses there are people who 

00:01:28.899 --> 00:01:33.580
 they will prefer no more than one little kiss per fingernail 

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:35.500
 then it is what you like most 

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:37.030
 and you can also play with colors 

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:38.350
 that you like most this is the 

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:40.750
 traditional but you could also 

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:46.330
 make fuchsia blue blacks dare to 

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:48.490
 play with whatever you want let it dry 

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:50.710
 at least 20 minutes before applying 

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:53.170
 the spicy toast and ready we have finished 

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:54.730
 it's a very creative and super fast idea 

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:56.800
 of doing and also that they remain super 

00:01:54.730 --> 00:01:58.780
 beautiful and striking for this time of 

00:01:56.800 --> 00:02:00.520
 appointments and all that and if you do not have an appointment 

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:02.590
 for that day do not worry you can 

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:05.320
 join your friends and among all 

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:06.580
 they make fun designs like this like this 

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:09.930
 I invite you to be inspired with your 

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:09.930
 dreams and give many kisses 

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:17.450
 and that has been all for today I hope that 

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:19.280
