00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
Joe: Thank you all for joining us again.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.000
In this segment we'll continue our discussion on

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.500
the mystery of human life and the purpose of man's existence.

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:21.500
Mark, in this segment, we'll be discussing specifically how

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:24.000
someone can receive the Lord for the first time

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
and contact God with their spirit for the first time.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
Can you share with us a little bit about this?

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.500
Mark: Right, yes. In the last segment
we covered how we need to use our spirit,

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:39.500
the third part of man's being, in order to contact God 
because God is Spirit

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:45.000
and so in order for us to contact Him as Spirit, 
we need to use our spirit.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:52.500
But how to receive Him for the first time, practically, 
it involves the following:

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:57.000
First, there needs to be what the Bible calls a repentance.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:03.000
Now, repentance is not a feeling of remorsefulness.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:08.000
It's not a turning over a new leaf. It's not making a resolution.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:13.000
Repentance is simply having a change of mind, 
kind of a change of heart.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.500
And many of the viewers may have already had this.

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:19.000
They now are turning their hearts away from whatever it was,

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.000
whether they were doing good or bad, it doesn't matter,

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.500
they're having a little bit of a turn.

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:30.000
And the next, the Bible according to John 1:12, tells us that: 
We need to believe into Him.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:37.500
We believe into Him, and by believing into Him, 
that's how we receive Him into our being.

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:41.000
According to John 1:12, "But as many as received Him,

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:46.000
He gave them authority to become children of God, 
to those who believe into His name."

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:52.000
But not only do we believe into Him, that's in our heart. 
There also needs to be a confession of our mouth.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.500
And that confession of the mouth is by calling on the Lord.

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:59.500
Calling Him, declaring that He is Lord: "Lord Jesus!"

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:06.000
According to Romans 10:9 it says, 
"If you confess with your mouth Lord Jesus

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:11.000
and believe in your heart that God has raised Him form the dead, 
you shall be saved."

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:20.000
But this culminates... the actual action that is required is prayer.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:25.500
It's by opening your mouth, believing in your heart, 
this culminates in a simple prayer.

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:29.500
And it can be quite a simple prayer.
It could be something to the effect of:

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:34.000
"Lord Jesus, thank you for dying for me,

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.500
I believe that You have risen from the dead

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:41.000
and become the life-giving Spirit so that You can come into me.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:46.500
I open my heart to You so that I can receive You, 
I believe into You,

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:53.000
I want You to save me, I receive You as my Lord 
and I receive You as my Savior.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:56.000
Lord Jesus I love You."

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.000
With such a simple prayer like that,

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:03.500
that is how we use our spirit to contact God, to receive Him,

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:11.000
and thereby fulfill the purpose of our human existence 
and begin to answer the mystery of human life.

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:16.500
Joe: Some who are viewing may have thought that it's very 
complicated and difficult to contact God,

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:20.000
even to pray to Him or even to receive Him for the first time.

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:24.500
But as you shared it's very easy. 
Just with a short simple prayer,

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:29.000
by turning your heart to the Lord, 
and asking Him to come in and to live inside of you,

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:33.500
anyone who is watching today can pray a prayer like this

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:35.000
and receive the Lord into their heart.

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:39.000
Mark, thank you for joining us today.

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:39.500
My pleasure.

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:42.500
For all of you, thank for joining us as well.

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:47.500
And we look forward to having more conversations 
on the "Basic Elements of the Christian Life" in the future.
