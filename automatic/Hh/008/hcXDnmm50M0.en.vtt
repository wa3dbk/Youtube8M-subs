00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:38.360 
that they've really given the amp it's

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:41.020 
that they've really given the amp it's
just<00:00:38.809> do<00:00:39.079> so<00:00:39.949> that's<00:00:40.129> what<00:00:40.370> I<00:00:40.400> figured<00:00:40.790> I<00:00:40.820> would

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:41.030 
just do so that's what I figured I would

00:00:43.519 --> 00:00:46.270 
do for you today it just put some
examples<00:00:44.030> on<00:00:44.239> of<00:00:44.420> the<00:00:45.260> different<00:00:45.680> sounds<00:00:46.160> when

00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:46.280 
examples on of the different sounds when

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:47.950 
examples on of the different sounds when
you<00:00:46.400> tweak<00:00:46.699> it<00:00:46.850> just<00:00:46.879> a<00:00:47.120> little<00:00:47.390> bit<00:00:47.540> what<00:00:47.809> you

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:47.960 
you tweak it just a little bit what you

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:49.750 
you tweak it just a little bit what you
can<00:00:48.110> get<00:00:48.260> out<00:00:48.410> of<00:00:48.530> this<00:00:48.620> amplifier<00:00:49.040> and<00:00:49.489> I

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:49.760 
can get out of this amplifier and I

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:52.329 
can get out of this amplifier and I
think<00:00:50.030> it's<00:00:50.180> really<00:00:50.540> excellent<00:00:50.930> so<00:00:51.860> we<00:00:52.070> start

00:00:52.329 --> 00:00:52.339 
think it's really excellent so we start

00:00:52.339 --> 00:00:54.160 
think it's really excellent so we start
off<00:00:52.430> with<00:00:52.580> a<00:00:52.640> little<00:00:52.940> bit<00:00:53.059> of<00:00:53.089> our<00:00:53.330> rock<00:00:53.900> type

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:54.170

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:12.730 
I think it's got everything it needs a

00:01:12.730 --> 00:01:13.980 
I think it's got everything it needs a
little<00:01:12.820> bit<00:01:13.000> of<00:01:13.150> a<00:01:13.240> tweak<00:01:13.480> it<00:01:13.660> sounds

00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:13.990

00:05:49.980 --> 00:05:49.990 
so I think it has it all excellent and

00:05:49.990 --> 00:05:52.500 
so I think it has it all excellent and
excellent<00:05:50.310> choices<00:05:51.310> even<00:05:52.060> though<00:05:52.330> it's
