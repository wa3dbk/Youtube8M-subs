 well let's make a list with what 

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:24.230
 which for us are the best 

00:00:21.110 --> 00:00:25.189
 smartphones of recent years so 

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:30.619
 without more 

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:32.750
 we started 1 samsung galaxy s 4 no doubt 

00:00:30.619 --> 00:00:35.449
 some is the best smartphone for 

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:38.300
 deadly to date if already the other 

00:00:35.449 --> 00:00:40.879
 samsung galaxy s3 was very good with 

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:42.049
 a lot of fluidity and power this is still 

00:00:40.879 --> 00:00:44.659
 best 

00:00:42.049 --> 00:00:47.780
 simply insurmountable almost did not 

00:00:44.659 --> 00:00:50.030
 hangs never touch screen hd camera 

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:52.580
 with a resolution of infarction and finally 

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:55.580
 can not say much more than no longer 

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:58.159
 You know why the bad is spectacular 

00:00:55.580 --> 00:01:03.049
 as always the price but that is already 

00:00:58.159 --> 00:01:05.320
 irremediable 2 samsung galaxy s3 when 

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:07.729
 it came out was a real bombshell 

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:10.310
 quickly if he said he was going to compete 

00:01:07.729 --> 00:01:12.049
 with him and puts 5 of 'paul' but with the 

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:13.040
 same speed with which the 

00:01:12.049 --> 00:01:16.850
 comparison 

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:19.220
 it went very fluid good camera good ram 

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:24.140
 and also as it takes android very 

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:27.200
 customizable 3 xperia z are finally and 

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:29.210
 hit the spot after trying without 

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:31.970
 very successful open a hole in the 

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:34.610
 market for new mobile Now 

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:36.560
 that has hit the table a 

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:41.390
 very good camera and good stability 

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:43.370
 support the xperia z4 and put 4 s when 

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:47.509
 He came out he also had many criticisms 

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:49.910
 positive an 8 mp camera recording 

00:01:47.509 --> 00:01:53.540
 video in 1080p and what else can you 

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:57.979
 and request processor myocardial 

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:59.840
 the best of the market 5 and puts 5 

00:01:57.979 --> 00:02:02.420
 but he lost the battle against 

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:04.910
 samsung galaxy yes and still a 

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:07.160

 eleventh htc does not get to match with 

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:19.489
 the big ones like the samsung cop but it's 

00:02:17.569 --> 00:02:21.980
 a good mobile if you do not have much 

00:02:19.489 --> 00:02:24.879
 budget speed and stability 

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:30.470
