00:00:41.209 --> 00:00:41.219 
years you use it sometimes not all the

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:41.690

time

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:41.700 
time

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:44.420 
time
but<00:00:42.180> tell<00:00:42.510> me<00:00:42.540> reasons<00:00:43.469> why<00:00:43.620> you<00:00:43.680> would<00:00:44.010> use<00:00:44.250> it

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
but tell me reasons why you would use it

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:46.670

maybe<00:00:45.390> if<00:00:45.510> you're<00:00:45.660> struggling<00:00:45.989> why<00:00:46.379> you<00:00:46.440> would

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.680 
maybe if you're struggling why you would

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:48.740 
maybe if you're struggling why you would
add<00:00:46.860> this<00:00:47.070> to<00:00:47.340> it<00:00:47.520> to<00:00:47.879> your<00:00:48.030> forehand<00:00:48.480> and

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:48.750 
add this to it to your forehand and

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:50.510 
add this to it to your forehand and
talked<00:00:49.230> a<00:00:49.260> little<00:00:49.410> bit<00:00:49.559> about<00:00:49.649> that<00:00:49.890> well<00:00:50.489> I

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:50.520 
talked a little bit about that well I

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:51.770 
talked a little bit about that well I
feel<00:00:50.820> like<00:00:50.879> it<00:00:51.120> really<00:00:51.149> helps<00:00:51.539> me<00:00:51.660> get

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780 
feel like it really helps me get

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:53.779 
feel like it really helps me get
balanced<00:00:52.230> after<00:00:52.680> the<00:00:52.800> shot<00:00:53.010> and<00:00:53.309> stops<00:00:53.670> me

00:00:53.779 --> 00:00:53.789 
balanced after the shot and stops me

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:55.310 
balanced after the shot and stops me
from<00:00:53.940> getting<00:00:54.120> stuck<00:00:54.390> on<00:00:54.539> my<00:00:54.690> front<00:00:54.960> foot<00:00:55.020> when

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
from getting stuck on my front foot when

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:57.590 
from getting stuck on my front foot when
I<00:00:55.350> step<00:00:55.620> in<00:00:55.649> so<00:00:56.550> it<00:00:56.730> kept<00:00:56.969> secure<00:00:57.239> my<00:00:57.390> weight

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
I step in so it kept secure my weight

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:59.090 
I step in so it kept secure my weight
moving<00:00:57.840> through<00:00:58.140> the<00:00:58.260> ball<00:00:58.469> and<00:00:58.739> I<00:00:58.920> can

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
moving through the ball and I can

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:00.950 
moving through the ball and I can
usually<00:00:59.219> hit<00:00:59.460> a<00:00:59.489> really<00:00:59.699> solid<00:00:59.850> shot<00:01:00.180> right

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 
usually hit a really solid shot right

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:03.590 
usually hit a really solid shot right
and<00:01:01.230> and<00:01:01.440> one<00:01:02.399> thing<00:01:02.430> that<00:01:02.640> I've<00:01:02.850> helped<00:01:03.449> him

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
and and one thing that I've helped him

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:05.090 
and and one thing that I've helped him
understand<00:01:04.170> is<00:01:04.320> that<00:01:04.500> at<00:01:04.589> the<00:01:04.680> end<00:01:04.710> of<00:01:05.010> the

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
understand is that at the end of the

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:07.070 
understand is that at the end of the
shot<00:01:05.339> if<00:01:05.580> he<00:01:05.610> feels<00:01:05.909> balanced<00:01:06.540> it<00:01:06.630> actually

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
shot if he feels balanced it actually

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:08.990 
shot if he feels balanced it actually
improves<00:01:07.530> the<00:01:07.650> quality<00:01:07.890> of<00:01:08.220> that<00:01:08.520> shot<00:01:08.790> even

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
improves the quality of that shot even

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.120 
improves the quality of that shot even
though<00:01:09.119> the<00:01:09.299> ball<00:01:09.479> is<00:01:09.659> long<00:01:09.900> gone<00:01:10.200> because<00:01:11.010> he

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
though the ball is long gone because he

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:12.950 
though the ball is long gone because he
has<00:01:11.340> in<00:01:11.520> his<00:01:11.640> mind<00:01:11.939> that<00:01:12.150> he<00:01:12.210> needs<00:01:12.479> to<00:01:12.630> get<00:01:12.750> to

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 
has in his mind that he needs to get to

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:15.200 
has in his mind that he needs to get to
a<00:01:12.990> certain<00:01:13.260> position<00:01:13.799> an<00:01:14.159> athletic<00:01:14.820> balanced

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
a certain position an athletic balanced

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:17.690 
a certain position an athletic balanced
position<00:01:15.780> so<00:01:16.409> max<00:01:16.920> is<00:01:17.070> going<00:01:17.220> to<00:01:17.280> go<00:01:17.400> ahead<00:01:17.460> and

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
position so max is going to go ahead and

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:19.910 
position so max is going to go ahead and
demonstrate<00:01:17.850> a<00:01:18.180> couple<00:01:18.570> and<00:01:18.720> then<00:01:19.290> when<00:01:19.770> we're
