rally<00:01:42.750> cars<00:01:43.049> out<00:01:43.289> there<00:01:43.320> I<00:01:43.740> don't<00:01:43.890> think<00:01:44.130> I've

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369 
rally cars out there I don't think I've

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:46.940 
rally cars out there I don't think I've
ever<00:01:44.520> seen<00:01:44.909> a<00:01:45.270> mid-race<00:01:45.869> pileup<00:01:46.439> as<00:01:46.619> big<00:01:46.799> as

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:46.950 
ever seen a mid-race pileup as big as

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:49.429 
ever seen a mid-race pileup as big as
that<00:01:47.100> one<00:01:47.159> that's<00:01:47.850> catastrophic<00:01:48.359> but<00:01:49.320> it's

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:49.439 
that one that's catastrophic but it's

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:51.770 
that one that's catastrophic but it's
catapulted<00:01:50.130> me<00:01:50.250> straight<00:01:50.759> into<00:01:50.939> p6<00:01:51.539> and

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:51.780 
catapulted me straight into p6 and

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:54.109 
catapulted me straight into p6 and
suddenly<00:01:52.380> there's<00:01:52.649> a<00:01:52.740> podium<00:01:53.250> possibility

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:54.119 
suddenly there's a podium possibility

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:55.789 
suddenly there's a podium possibility
here<00:01:54.299> as<00:01:54.420> I've<00:01:54.539> Drive<00:01:54.840> through<00:01:55.170> lots<00:01:55.409> of<00:01:55.560> dust

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:55.799

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:13.770 
driving sideways won't entirely sure

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:15.920 
driving sideways won't entirely sure
that<00:02:13.950> it<00:02:14.430> must<00:02:14.670> be<00:02:14.820> hovercraft<00:02:15.330> that<00:02:15.480> car<00:02:15.750> or

that it must be hovercraft that car or

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:17.480 
that it must be hovercraft that car or
something<00:02:16.320> because<00:02:16.620> something<00:02:17.040> fishy<00:02:17.280> was

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:17.490 
something because something fishy was

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:18.290 
something because something fishy was
going<00:02:17.580> on<00:02:17.910> there

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:18.300 
going on there

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:20.030 
going on there
and<00:02:18.390> he<00:02:18.690> just<00:02:18.870> started<00:02:19.260> driving<00:02:19.500> sideways

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:20.040 
and he just started driving sideways

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:22.640

I've<00:02:20.790> played<00:02:21.180> so<00:02:21.540> many<00:02:21.810> hours<00:02:21.959> of<00:02:22.140> this<00:02:22.409> game

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:22.650 
I've played so many hours of this game

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:24.990 
I've played so many hours of this game
but<00:02:22.830> it<00:02:22.950> still<00:02:23.250> throws<00:02:23.580> up<00:02:23.790> surprises

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:25.000 
but it still throws up surprises

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.450 
but it still throws up surprises
is<00:02:25.300> like<00:02:25.510> me<00:02:25.720> being<00:02:25.960> in<00:02:26.140> p4<00:02:26.620> as<00:02:26.860> we<00:02:27.010> go<00:02:27.130> over<00:02:27.370> the

start/finish straight but oh no the
Sabbath<00:02:29.830> air<00:02:29.980> has<00:02:30.190> soared<00:02:31.120> to<00:02:31.240> the<00:02:31.360> end<00:02:31.570> of

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:31.720 
Sabbath air has soared to the end of

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:33.930 
Sabbath air has soared to the end of
that<00:02:31.870> one<00:02:32.080> and<00:02:32.290> cut<00:02:32.620> me<00:02:32.740> cut<00:02:33.490> me<00:02:33.580> down<00:02:33.730> with

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:33.940 
that one and cut me cut me down with

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:35.370 
that one and cut me cut me down with
better<00:02:34.120> exit<00:02:34.540> speed<00:02:34.780> and<00:02:34.960> I've<00:02:35.050> now<00:02:35.170> got<00:02:35.350> a

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:35.380 
better exit speed and I've now got a

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:37.080 
better exit speed and I've now got a
Williams<00:02:35.830> on<00:02:35.980> my<00:02:36.100> inside<00:02:36.400> this<00:02:36.610> could<00:02:36.820> be<00:02:37.000> an

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:37.090 
Williams on my inside this could be an

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:38.550 
Williams on my inside this could be an
ugly<00:02:37.360> term<00:02:37.600> one<00:02:37.840> or<00:02:37.990> it<00:02:38.080> could<00:02:38.230> be<00:02:38.320> a<00:02:38.350> pretty

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:38.560 
ugly term one or it could be a pretty

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:40.620 
ugly term one or it could be a pretty
one<00:02:38.800> depending<00:02:39.190> on<00:02:39.280> the<00:02:39.400> ration<00:02:40.180> recklessness

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:40.630 
one depending on the ration recklessness

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:43.140 
one depending on the ration recklessness
of<00:02:40.960> that<00:02:41.080> Williams<00:02:41.440> but<00:02:41.560> he<00:02:41.680> pretty<00:02:42.640> reserved

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:43.150 
of that Williams but he pretty reserved

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:45.630 
of that Williams but he pretty reserved
so<00:02:43.540> far<00:02:43.840> because<00:02:44.620> he's<00:02:44.830> not<00:02:45.040> thrown<00:02:45.430> it<00:02:45.610> down

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:45.640 
so far because he's not thrown it down

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:48.120 
so far because he's not thrown it down
me<00:02:45.880> inside<00:02:46.240> and<00:02:46.390> I<00:02:46.480> maintain<00:02:46.750> p5<00:02:47.650> behind<00:02:48.010> this

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:48.130 
me inside and I maintain p5 behind this

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:50.130 
me inside and I maintain p5 behind this
Salva<00:02:48.550> and<00:02:48.730> look<00:02:49.510> at<00:02:49.630> it<00:02:49.750> I<00:02:49.840> could<00:02:49.900> actually

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:50.140 
Salva and look at it I could actually

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:51.840 
Salva and look at it I could actually
win<00:02:50.350> this<00:02:50.770> Grand<00:02:51.100> Prix<00:02:51.370> you<00:02:51.520> know<00:02:51.640> I'm<00:02:51.730> not

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:51.850 
win this Grand Prix you know I'm not

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:54.630 
win this Grand Prix you know I'm not
that<00:02:52.030> far<00:02:52.300> behind<00:02:52.530> behind<00:02:53.530> the<00:02:53.740> the<00:02:54.430> leader

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:54.640 
that far behind behind the the leader

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:56.580 
that far behind behind the the leader
he's<00:02:54.880> only<00:02:55.030> about<00:02:55.270> a<00:02:55.300> corner<00:02:55.840> or<00:02:56.020> so<00:02:56.260> ahead<00:02:56.500> of

00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:56.590 
he's only about a corner or so ahead of

00:02:56.590 --> 00:02:58.500 
he's only about a corner or so ahead of
me<00:02:56.709> I<00:02:56.740> realized<00:02:57.190> that<00:02:57.340> every<00:02:57.940> time<00:02:58.150> I<00:02:58.180> say<00:02:58.480> that

00:02:58.500 --> 00:02:58.510 
me I realized that every time I say that

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:00.900 
me I realized that every time I say that
I<00:02:58.750> do<00:02:58.870> I'd<00:02:59.080> end<00:02:59.200> up<00:02:59.260> losing<00:02:59.530> but<00:02:59.950> anyway<00:03:00.280> it's

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:00.910 
I do I'd end up losing but anyway it's

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:02.729 
I do I'd end up losing but anyway it's
at<00:03:01.120> this<00:03:01.270> stage<00:03:01.570> I<00:03:01.840> realize<00:03:02.170> the<00:03:02.350> Grand<00:03:02.560> Prix

00:03:02.729 --> 00:03:02.739 
at this stage I realize the Grand Prix

00:03:02.739 --> 00:03:04.170 
at this stage I realize the Grand Prix
is<00:03:02.800> getting<00:03:03.040> a<00:03:03.100> bit<00:03:03.280> dull<00:03:03.580> as<00:03:03.760> I'm<00:03:03.880> sort<00:03:04.060> of
