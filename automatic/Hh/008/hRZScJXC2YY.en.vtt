up on the house top ears so it's like

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:13.830 
up on the house top ears so it's like
one<00:02:06.600> three<00:02:10.170> and<00:02:11.170> we<00:02:11.319> go<00:02:11.470> to<00:02:11.530> a<00:02:11.709> C<00:02:12.390> C's<00:02:13.390> gonna<00:02:13.660> go

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:13.840 
one three and we go to a C C's gonna go

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:16.260 
one three and we go to a C C's gonna go
by<00:02:14.050> real<00:02:14.319> fast<00:02:14.350> because<00:02:15.160> this<00:02:15.489> measure<00:02:15.850> is

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:16.270 
by real fast because this measure is

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:18.390 
by real fast because this measure is
shared<00:02:16.690> with<00:02:16.989> G<00:02:17.290> they're<00:02:17.560> each<00:02:17.739> gonna<00:02:17.980> get<00:02:18.190> two

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:18.400 
shared with G they're each gonna get two

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:23.720 
shared with G they're each gonna get two
beats<00:02:18.640> the<00:02:18.970> C<00:02:19.209> goes<00:02:19.480> out<00:02:20.700> jumps<00:02:21.700> then<00:02:22.690> G<00:02:22.959> good

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:23.730 
beats the C goes out jumps then G good

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:29.759 
beats the C goes out jumps then G good
see<00:02:24.730> that<00:02:24.910> was<00:02:25.090> one<00:02:25.450> two<00:02:26.140> three<00:02:27.930> sea<00:02:28.930> bass<00:02:29.350> note

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:44.680 
itself D or D seven I'll do a D this

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:51.030 
itself D or D seven I'll do a D this
time<00:02:44.920> that's<00:02:45.730> a<00:02:45.880> part<00:02:46.120> that<00:02:46.150> goes<00:02:49.200> so<00:02:50.200> we<00:02:50.709> need

00:04:49.659 --> 00:04:49.669 
three four down through the chimney you

00:04:49.669 --> 00:04:52.990 
three four down through the chimney you
know<00:04:49.849> or<00:04:50.120> I<00:04:50.150> can<00:04:50.360> just

00:04:52.990 --> 00:04:53.000 

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:56.390 

I<00:04:54.000> mess<00:04:54.720> around<00:04:54.750> whatever<00:04:55.590> and<00:04:55.920> then<00:04:56.010> finally

00:04:56.390 --> 00:04:56.400 
I mess around whatever and then finally

00:04:56.400 --> 00:04:59.660 
I mess around whatever and then finally
come<00:04:56.580> in<00:04:56.760> down<00:04:57.560> at<00:04:58.560> the<00:04:58.680> point<00:04:58.950> so<00:04:59.190> you<00:04:59.250> hold<00:04:59.520> it

00:04:59.660 --> 00:04:59.670 
come in down at the point so you hold it

00:04:59.670 --> 00:05:02.210 
come in down at the point so you hold it
as<00:04:59.820> long<00:04:59.850> as<00:05:00.030> you<00:05:00.240> want<00:05:00.510> to<00:05:00.650> and<00:05:01.650> if<00:05:01.860> it<00:05:01.980> feels

00:05:02.210 --> 00:05:02.220 
as long as you want to and if it feels

00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:07.910 
as long as you want to and if it feels
good<00:05:02.640> then<00:05:03.150> do<00:05:03.510> it<00:05:03.750> you<00:05:04.320> know<00:05:04.760> and<00:05:05.760> so<00:05:06.650> the<00:05:07.650> next

00:05:07.910 --> 00:05:07.920 
good then do it you know and so the next

00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:10.400 
good then do it you know and so the next
after<00:05:08.400> that<00:05:08.430> holding<00:05:08.910> that<00:05:08.940> 87<00:05:09.570> we<00:05:09.660> need<00:05:09.840> a<00:05:09.870> g1

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:10.410 
after that holding that 87 we need a g1

00:05:10.410 --> 00:05:15.320 
after that holding that 87 we need a g1
measure<00:05:10.710> down<00:05:11.520> through<00:05:12.150> the<00:05:12.390> tube<00:05:12.720> and<00:05:13.460> then<00:05:14.460> a

00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:15.330 
measure down through the tube and then a

00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:23.120 
measure down through the tube and then a
d7<00:05:16.200> and<00:05:16.590> a<00:05:17.460> G<00:05:21.080> same<00:05:22.080> thing<00:05:22.410> we're<00:05:22.560> holding<00:05:22.980> that

00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:23.130 
d7 and a G same thing we're holding that

00:05:23.130 --> 00:05:27.170 
d7 and a G same thing we're holding that
now<00:05:23.790> it<00:05:24.000> goes<00:05:24.210> back<00:05:25.100> to<00:05:26.100> the<00:05:26.310> very<00:05:26.580> beginning

00:05:27.170 --> 00:05:27.180 
now it goes back to the very beginning

00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:30.380 
now it goes back to the very beginning
and<00:05:27.390> repeats<00:05:27.840> everything<00:05:28.530> we<00:05:28.740> just<00:05:28.770> did<00:05:29.580> again

00:05:30.380 --> 00:05:30.390 
and repeats everything we just did again

00:05:30.390 --> 00:05:34.910 
and repeats everything we just did again
for<00:05:31.350> the<00:05:31.500> second<00:05:32.010> verse<00:05:32.840> and<00:05:33.840> then<00:05:34.530> we<00:05:34.650> come<00:05:34.890> to

00:05:34.910 --> 00:05:34.920 
for the second verse and then we come to

00:05:34.920 --> 00:05:38.060 
for the second verse and then we come to
the<00:05:35.190> end<00:05:35.370> where<00:05:36.440> I'm<00:05:37.440> going<00:05:37.650> to<00:05:37.710> take<00:05:37.800> it<00:05:37.950> from

00:05:38.060 --> 00:05:38.070 
the end where I'm going to take it from

00:05:38.070 --> 00:05:41.300 
the end where I'm going to take it from
that<00:05:38.720> down<00:05:39.720> through<00:05:40.590> the<00:05:40.710> chimney<00:05:40.920> thing

00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:41.310 
that down through the chimney thing

00:05:41.310 --> 00:05:46.220
