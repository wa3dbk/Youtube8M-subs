help you hear it better I've opened up

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:19.340 
help you hear it better I've opened up
the<00:00:15.690> case<00:00:16.020> of<00:00:16.520> the<00:00:17.520> duo<00:00:17.760> depth<00:00:18.150> this<00:00:18.990> lets<00:00:19.260> the

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:19.350 
the case of the duo depth this lets the

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:22.370 
the case of the duo depth this lets the
sound<00:00:19.710> travel<00:00:20.130> from<00:00:20.310> the<00:00:20.460> speakers<00:00:20.880> into<00:00:21.380> the

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:22.380 
sound travel from the speakers into the

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:26.089 
sound travel from the speakers into the
camera<00:00:22.650> a<00:00:23.070> little<00:00:23.699> bit<00:00:24.090> easier<00:00:24.920> so<00:00:25.920> this

00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:26.099 
camera a little bit easier so this

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:29.810 
camera a little bit easier so this
program<00:00:26.580> is<00:00:26.789> pretty<00:00:27.390> simple<00:00:28.109> all<00:00:28.590> you<00:00:29.340> do<00:00:29.699> is

502 this song is I used to demonstrate

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:24.340 
502 this song is I used to demonstrate
the<00:01:19.450> arpeggiated<00:01:20.710> ability<00:01:21.710> of<00:01:21.920> the<00:01:22.340> music<00:01:23.350> on

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:24.350

the arpeggiated ability of the music on
the<00:01:24.830> duo<00:01:25.009> depp's<00:01:25.310> so<00:01:25.940> you'll<00:01:26.330> notice<00:01:26.720> that

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:26.750 
the duo depp's so you'll notice that

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:31.060 
the duo depp's so you'll notice that
there's<00:01:27.070> two<00:01:28.070> parts<00:01:28.580> of<00:01:28.790> the<00:01:29.119> song<00:01:29.530> where<00:01:30.530> it

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:31.070 
there's two parts of the song where it

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:33.870 
there's two parts of the song where it
plays<00:01:31.429> notes<00:01:31.840> alternatingly<00:01:32.840> really<00:01:33.560> fast

00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:33.880 
plays notes alternatingly really fast

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:45.100 
plays notes alternatingly really fast
I'll<00:01:34.880> just<00:01:35.090> let<00:01:35.240> you<00:01:35.300> listen<00:01:35.840> to<00:01:35.990> it<00:01:42.369> so<00:01:44.110> that's

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:45.110 
I'll just let you listen to it so that's

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:48.460 
I'll just let you listen to it so that's
when<00:01:45.830> it<00:01:45.950> plays<00:01:46.160> two<00:01:46.429> notes<00:01:46.460> in<00:01:47.470> alternating

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:48.470 
when it plays two notes in alternating

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:50.100 
when it plays two notes in alternating
order<00:01:48.860> really<00:01:49.009> quickly<00:01:49.460> that's<00:01:49.670> called

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:50.110 
order really quickly that's called

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:54.160 
order really quickly that's called
arpeggio<00:01:51.110> and<00:01:51.940> that<00:01:52.940> can<00:01:53.090> be<00:01:53.149> used<00:01:53.450> to<00:01:53.600> make<00:01:53.780> it

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:54.170 
arpeggio and that can be used to make it

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:56.200 
arpeggio and that can be used to make it
sound<00:01:54.470> like<00:01:54.830> you're<00:01:55.069> playing<00:01:55.310> two<00:01:55.729> notes<00:01:55.940> at

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:56.210 
sound like you're playing two notes at

00:01:56.210 --> 00:01:59.050 
sound like you're playing two notes at
the<00:01:56.240> same<00:01:56.360> time<00:01:56.899> although<00:01:57.740> you<00:01:58.100> aren't<00:01:58.520> really

00:01:59.050 --> 00:01:59.060 
the same time although you aren't really

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:00.820 
the same time although you aren't really
because<00:01:59.659> there's<00:01:59.840> only<00:01:59.960> one<00:02:00.170> sound<00:02:00.500> channel

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:00.830 
because there's only one sound channel

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:05.289 
because there's only one sound channel
that's<00:02:01.820> all<00:02:02.090> I<00:02:02.329> have<00:02:02.689> fun<00:02:03.049> now<00:02:03.790> on<00:02:04.790> the<00:02:05.149> next

00:02:05.289 --> 00:02:05.299 
that's all I have fun now on the next

00:02:05.299 --> 00:02:08.050 
that's all I have fun now on the next
video<00:02:05.659> I<00:02:05.960> will<00:02:05.990> actually<00:02:06.590> write<00:02:07.340> some<00:02:07.790> of<00:02:07.939> the

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:08.060 
video I will actually write some of the

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:10.690 
video I will actually write some of the
songs<00:02:08.420> that<00:02:08.600> you<00:02:08.899> guys<00:02:09.079> recommended<00:02:09.769> and<00:02:09.920> then
