00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.750
 the godfather of this case of 

00:00:01.650 --> 00:00:06.120
 child disappearance yes in hill 

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:08.429
 ivory serving are all 

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:11.340
 parents of children here and I was pastor 

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:12.630
 to find that ritual crimes have 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:15.450
 gained momentum at the new coast 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:18.510
 of ivory with children who are 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:21.840
 kidnapped on the way to school in 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:25.910
 the heads are cut off the organs 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:25.910
 genitals are completely mutilated 

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:30.560
 it's scary when you've seen the 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:34.410
 images that I saw on the net 

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:39.300
 these two there you speak to me to me and 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:41.280
 it only makes the place stop 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:44.730
 a few people like you liked about 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:46.680
 miss as higher wages 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:49.170
 and the people who opposed his actions 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:50.190
 but the party is only doing dance is 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:52.500
 the occasion of a leap for me for 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:55.230
 come back all new to history remember 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:56.730
 here that this practice there the clip 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:57.120
 hold a gale is not 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:00.469
 news 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:04.140
 yes when the Ivory Coast rebellion 

00:01:00.469 --> 00:01:09.540
 had cut the country in two at the level 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:12.330
 from the north in 2002 there were crimes 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:17.340
 rituals where we saw rebels 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:20.159
 slaughtering human beings group himself 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:23.070
 feel to save what we slaughtered the 

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:26.580
 say between those who were there they 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:28.409
 have been drinking a mass and I 'm going 

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:31.079
 ask because I do not want any more 

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:34.950
 shows this picture going on there were some 

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:38.549
 white soldiers during French by 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:39.060
 meriem during these rituals of which it is 

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:42.420
 not new 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:45.000
 what do people do with 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:47.310
 practices also also dentist of this 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.110
 type there they will tell themselves what power 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:51.420
 they have no power 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:53.040
 these are stories he tells in 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:56.070
 what a cry of alarmed once more 

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:58.140
 that I launch to all peoples 

00:01:56.070 --> 00:02:00.479
 African to all African decision makers 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:03.840
 to those who think that does politics 

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:05.640
 has also plunged his man and where 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:08.369
 his body in practices too 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:10.020
 dark as far as really what 

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:11.340
 last are not unique to the coast 

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:13.470
 ivory 

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:16.349
 really we saw gabon german 

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:19.290
 even dominate in cameroon abandoned a 

00:02:16.349 --> 00:02:21.450
 knee let's say that these are practices 

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:24.269
 takes us back that he does not do 

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:25.860
 at all advanced is alas all 

00:02:24.269 --> 00:02:27.780
 parents can see today it is 

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:30.900
 people to send children to school 

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:31.620
 so so really I hope that the 

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:33.930
 authorities in place 

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:36.900
 we can measure this case I 

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:38.879
 now I do not know if it's wrong 

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:41.370
 laughed well if fred it's a little for 

00:02:38.879 --> 00:02:43.860
 this i feel the most and the sameth 

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:46.349
 bakayoko says no it's another 

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:48.540
 way to love them the ivory coast 

00:02:46.349 --> 00:02:50.640
 to tarnish the image of the Ivory Coast 

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:53.310
 but there are some nice gentleman facts but 

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:56.280
 would not be towards a did not play there at 

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:59.190
 the Cliff Pemble to measurement problems 

00:02:56.280 --> 00:03:02.190
 instead of doubling everything to return is this 

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:03.829
 not the poor game on the obs it's 

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:06.780
 really unacceptable 

00:03:03.829 --> 00:03:09.090
 this way of thinking and managing the 

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:12.920
 things in an early patio because there we think 

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:12.920
 as important as yours
