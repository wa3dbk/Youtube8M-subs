went off those two domes wouldn't get

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:46.670 
went off those two domes wouldn't get
out<00:01:44.579> we<00:01:44.790> were<00:01:44.880> stuck<00:01:45.090> in<00:01:45.210> the<00:01:45.270> middle<00:01:45.390> but<00:01:46.290> it

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:46.680 
out we were stuck in the middle but it

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:49.280 
out we were stuck in the middle but it
was<00:01:46.829> just<00:01:47.040> a<00:01:47.130> case<00:01:47.310> of<00:01:47.570> fighting<00:01:48.570> on<00:01:48.899> survive

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:49.290 
was just a case of fighting on survive

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:51.139 
was just a case of fighting on survive
and<00:01:49.710> shoot<00:01:50.130> the<00:01:50.250> soldiers<00:01:50.670> that<00:01:50.790> would<00:01:50.970> come

00:01:51.139 --> 00:01:51.149 
and shoot the soldiers that would come

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:54.139 
and shoot the soldiers that would come
in<00:01:51.270> in<00:01:51.799> but<00:01:52.799> apart<00:01:53.159> from<00:01:53.250> that<00:01:53.399> it<00:01:53.759> was<00:01:53.909> pretty

00:01:54.139 --> 00:01:54.149 
in in but apart from that it was pretty

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:57.770 
in in but apart from that it was pretty
straightforward<00:01:54.509> and<00:01:55.909> when<00:01:56.909> the<00:01:57.119> aerial

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:57.780 
straightforward and when the aerial

00:01:57.780 --> 00:01:59.899 
straightforward and when the aerial
rounds<00:01:58.200> come<00:01:58.469> we<00:01:58.680> were<00:01:58.770> basically<00:01:59.070> just<00:01:59.460> pop

00:01:59.899 --> 00:01:59.909 
rounds come we were basically just pop

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:01.819 
rounds come we were basically just pop
jump<00:02:00.240> and<00:02:00.450> popping<00:02:00.780> out<00:02:00.930> popping<00:02:01.619> them<00:02:01.710> off

00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:01.829 
jump and popping out popping them off

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:03.469 
jump and popping out popping them off
because<00:02:01.979> they<00:02:02.219> they<00:02:02.610> seemed<00:02:02.880> to<00:02:03.090> have<00:02:03.119> come

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:03.479 
because they they seemed to have come

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:05.660 
because they they seemed to have come

remember<00:03:51.850> what<00:03:52.240> they<00:03:52.330> call<00:03:52.570> now<00:03:52.780> we're<00:03:53.200> not

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:53.320 
remember what they call now we're not

00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:55.800 
remember what they call now we're not
gonna<00:03:53.440> do<00:03:53.620> raid<00:03:53.890> because<00:03:54.490> rage<00:03:54.760> is<00:03:54.970> only<00:03:55.120> 211

00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:55.810 
gonna do raid because rage is only 211

00:03:55.810 --> 00:03:59.270 
gonna do raid because rage is only 211
and<00:03:56.200> if<00:03:56.709> you've<00:03:57.300> managed<00:03:58.300> to<00:03:58.450> unlock<00:03:58.630> raid

00:03:59.270 --> 00:03:59.280 
and if you've managed to unlock raid

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:02.400 
and if you've managed to unlock raid
then<00:04:00.300> you<00:04:01.300> shouldn't<00:04:02.110> have<00:04:02.170> a<00:04:02.320> problem

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:02.410 
then you shouldn't have a problem

00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:04.650 
then you shouldn't have a problem
getting<00:04:02.980> to<00:04:03.070> wave<00:04:03.340> 11<00:04:03.850> so<00:04:04.150> there's<00:04:04.390> no<00:04:04.510> point

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:04.660 
getting to wave 11 so there's no point

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:08.370 
getting to wave 11 so there's no point
is<00:04:04.870> doing<00:04:05.110> the<00:04:05.170> strategy<00:04:05.560> for<00:04:05.709> that<00:04:07.110> and<00:04:08.110> as

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:08.380 
is doing the strategy for that and as

00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:10.110 
is doing the strategy for that and as
you<00:04:08.530> know<00:04:08.680> it<00:04:08.860> turns<00:04:09.130> into<00:04:09.340> the<00:04:09.520> old<00:04:09.670> zombies

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:10.120 
you know it turns into the old zombies

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:12.390 
you know it turns into the old zombies
mode<00:04:10.390> so<00:04:11.080> we're<00:04:11.470> looking<00:04:11.740> forward<00:04:11.980> to<00:04:12.130> that

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:12.400 
mode so we're looking forward to that

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:14.550 
mode so we're looking forward to that
and<00:04:12.580> apparently<00:04:12.760> it's<00:04:13.120> coming<00:04:13.420> in<00:04:13.570> January<00:04:13.870> so

00:04:14.550 --> 00:04:14.560 
and apparently it's coming in January so

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:16.590 
and apparently it's coming in January so
we're<00:04:15.490> trying<00:04:15.760> to<00:04:15.880> get<00:04:15.970> all<00:04:16.120> these<00:04:16.270> strategies

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:16.600 
we're trying to get all these strategies

00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:18.840 
we're trying to get all these strategies
mopped<00:04:17.049> up<00:04:17.260> and<00:04:17.560> then<00:04:18.280> we'll<00:04:18.460> see<00:04:18.640> what

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:18.850 
mopped up and then we'll see what

00:04:18.850 --> 00:04:20.400 
mopped up and then we'll see what
