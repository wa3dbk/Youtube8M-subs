00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:52.110 
which are balanced armature drivers

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:53.870 
which are balanced armature drivers
don't<00:01:52.409> know<00:01:52.649> how<00:01:52.710> to<00:01:52.860> pronounce<00:01:53.159> that<00:01:53.430> which

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:53.880 
don't know how to pronounce that which

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:57.590 
don't know how to pronounce that which
is<00:01:54.090> a<00:01:54.180> plus<00:01:54.509> digest<00:01:55.020> there<00:01:55.460> and<00:01:56.460> if<00:01:56.610> you<00:01:56.729> just

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:57.600 
is a plus digest there and if you just

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:59.749 
is a plus digest there and if you just
that<00:01:57.840> cluster<00:01:58.320> there<00:01:58.649> then<00:01:59.040> you<00:01:59.250> have<00:01:59.280> that

00:01:59.749 --> 00:01:59.759 
that cluster there then you have that

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:03.260 
that cluster there then you have that
short<00:01:59.969> dynamic<00:02:00.630> driver<00:02:00.869> which<00:02:01.140> is<00:02:01.640> the<00:02:02.640> black

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:03.270 
short dynamic driver which is the black

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:05.810 
short dynamic driver which is the black
