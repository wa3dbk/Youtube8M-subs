00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:15.650 
470 6850 experience / body and I died

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:19.260 
470 6850 experience / body and I died
out<00:02:15.800> there<00:02:15.920> cool

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:19.270 

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:21.520 

so<00:02:20.270> you're<00:02:20.390> halfway<00:02:20.540> done<00:02:20.690> at<00:02:20.870> this<00:02:20.930> point<00:02:21.200> I'm

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:21.530 
so you're halfway done at this point I'm

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:25.090 
so you're halfway done at this point I'm
just<00:02:21.620> going<00:02:21.830> to<00:02:21.860> resin<00:02:22.160> my<00:02:22.250> corpse<00:02:23.320> and<00:02:24.320> we're

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:25.100 
just going to resin my corpse and we're

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:27.250 
just going to resin my corpse and we're
going<00:02:25.220> to<00:02:25.250> want<00:02:25.460> to<00:02:25.520> round<00:02:25.820> up<00:02:26.150> the<00:02:26.900> rest<00:02:27.080> of

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:27.260 
going to want to round up the rest of

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:32.730 
going to want to round up the rest of
them<00:02:27.380> over<00:02:27.440> here<00:02:27.560> to<00:02:27.710> the<00:02:27.800> left<00:02:29.650> in<00:02:30.650> this<00:02:30.860> room

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:32.740 
them over here to the left in this room

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:35.650 
them over here to the left in this room
so<00:02:33.740> without<00:02:34.400> that<00:02:34.460> death<00:02:34.820> they'd<00:02:35.060> be<00:02:35.210> a<00:02:35.240> little

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:35.660 
so without that death they'd be a little

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:37.720 
so without that death they'd be a little
faster<00:02:36.080> but<00:02:36.260> as<00:02:36.500> you<00:02:37.190> can<00:02:37.280> see<00:02:37.460> it's<00:02:37.580> pretty

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:37.730 
faster but as you can see it's pretty

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:41.140 
faster but as you can see it's pretty
fast<00:02:38.030> itself<00:02:38.480> already<00:02:39.670> long<00:02:40.670> you<00:02:40.850> don't<00:02:41.000> get

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:41.150 
fast itself already long you don't get

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:48.160 
fast itself already long you don't get
