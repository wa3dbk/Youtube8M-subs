need<00:00:53.160> replacing<00:00:54.350> so<00:00:55.350> what<00:00:55.500> I'm<00:00:55.590> going<00:00:55.739> to<00:00:55.829> do

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039 
need replacing so what I'm going to do

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:58.970 
need replacing so what I'm going to do
is<00:00:56.309> take<00:00:56.969> a<00:00:57.000> quicker<00:00:57.329> closer<00:00:58.320> look<00:00:58.739> at<00:00:58.859> these

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
is take a quicker closer look at these

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:01.689 
is take a quicker closer look at these
and<00:00:59.340> then<00:00:59.670> get<00:00:59.850> on<00:00:59.879> with<00:01:00.120> replacing<00:01:00.690> them<00:01:00.870> with

00:01:01.689 --> 00:01:01.699 
and then get on with replacing them with

00:01:01.699 --> 00:01:04.429 
and then get on with replacing them with
this<00:01:02.699> main<00:01:02.940> board<00:01:03.210> then<00:01:03.480> connecting<00:01:04.260> on<00:01:04.350> the

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:04.439 
this main board then connecting on the

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:06.800 
this main board then connecting on the
stage<00:01:04.650> you<00:01:04.830> can<00:01:04.979> see<00:01:05.339> is<00:01:06.060> damaged<00:01:06.450> from<00:01:06.570> here<00:01:06.780> I

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
stage you can see is damaged from here I

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:09.320 
stage you can see is damaged from here I
sort<00:01:07.110> of<00:01:07.140> quite<00:01:07.350> an<00:01:07.560> to<00:01:07.740> shape<00:01:07.979> so<00:01:08.430> we're<00:01:09.180> going

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
sort of quite an to shape so we're going

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:12.490 
sort of quite an to shape so we're going
to<00:01:09.570> d<00:01:09.900> solder<00:01:10.380> and<00:01:10.640> solder<00:01:11.640> a<00:01:11.670> new<00:01:11.880> one<00:01:12.119> on

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:12.500 
to d solder and solder a new one on

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:14.539 
to d solder and solder a new one on
connector<00:01:13.500> number<00:01:13.710> seven<00:01:14.010> doesn't<00:01:14.310> look<00:01:14.520> that

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549 
connector number seven doesn't look that

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:18.560 
connector number seven doesn't look that
bad<00:01:15.030> i'm<00:01:15.270> told<00:01:15.630> though<00:01:15.930> that<00:01:16.549> the<00:01:17.570> Wi-Fi

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570 
bad i'm told though that the Wi-Fi

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:23.390 
bad i'm told though that the Wi-Fi
connects<00:01:19.049> our<00:01:19.259> the<00:01:19.439> mobile<00:01:20.420> antenna<00:01:21.740> can<00:01:22.740> come

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400 
connects our the mobile antenna can come

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:27.140 
connects our the mobile antenna can come
off<00:01:23.840> quite<00:01:24.840> easily<00:01:24.869> sometimes<00:01:25.590> so<00:01:26.280> we've<00:01:27.060> been

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:27.150 
off quite easily sometimes so we've been

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:31.280 
off quite easily sometimes so we've been
asked<00:01:27.420> to<00:01:28.009> solder<00:01:29.009> the<00:01:29.189> new<00:01:29.520> connector<00:01:30.060> on<00:01:30.290> to

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:31.290 
asked to solder the new connector on to

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:32.899 
asked to solder the new connector on to
make<00:01:31.470> sure<00:01:31.590> that<00:01:31.770> doesn't<00:01:31.799> happen<00:01:32.130> again<00:01:32.430> so

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:32.909 
make sure that doesn't happen again so

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:34.730 
make sure that doesn't happen again so
we're<00:01:33.060> going<00:01:33.180> to<00:01:33.299> solder<00:01:34.020> in<00:01:34.229> two<00:01:34.530> new

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740 
we're going to solder in two new

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:36.760 
we're going to solder in two new
connectors<00:01:35.369> and<00:01:35.579> then<00:01:36.030> we'll<00:01:36.210> put<00:01:36.420> the

sold it in with our file contacts so
next<00:02:14.590> we're<00:02:14.830> going<00:02:14.950> to<00:02:15.010> be<00:02:15.100> cutting<00:02:15.280> in<00:02:16.680> this

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:17.680 
next we're going to be cutting in this

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:19.890 
next we're going to be cutting in this
connector<00:02:18.160> here<00:02:18.370> for<00:02:18.820> connecting<00:02:19.510> number<00:02:19.720> six

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:19.900 
connector here for connecting number six

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:21.540 
connector here for connecting number six
for<00:02:19.990> the<00:02:20.080> Wi-Fi<00:02:20.470> and<00:02:20.800> then<00:02:20.950> we'll<00:02:21.040> go<00:02:21.160> test<00:02:21.430> it

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:21.550 
for the Wi-Fi and then we'll go test it

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:23.310 
for the Wi-Fi and then we'll go test it
here<00:02:21.730> we<00:02:22.090> are<00:02:22.240> then<00:02:22.360> the<00:02:22.510> new<00:02:22.600> connector<00:02:23.050> six

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:23.320 
here we are then the new connector six

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:27.200 
here we are then the new connector six
is<00:02:23.530> in<00:02:23.940> next<00:02:24.940> now<00:02:25.300> we're<00:02:25.540> going<00:02:25.690> to<00:02:25.810> be<00:02:26.020> testing

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:27.210 
is in next now we're going to be testing

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:31.560 
is in next now we're going to be testing
the<00:02:28.410> main<00:02:29.410> baat<00:02:29.650> in<00:02:29.980> a<00:02:30.430> 3gs<00:02:30.970> coach<00:02:31.210> to<00:02:31.420> make

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:31.570 
the main baat in a 3gs coach to make

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:33.390 
the main baat in a 3gs coach to make
sure<00:02:31.690> everything<00:02:32.200> is<00:02:32.380> okay<00:02:32.830> testing<00:02:33.250> this

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:33.400 
sure everything is okay testing this

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:37.170 
sure everything is okay testing this
main<00:02:33.700> board<00:02:34.030> with<00:02:34.360> the<00:02:34.900> connector<00:02:35.910> the<00:02:36.910> new

make sure everything is okay we've got
it<00:02:43.510> in<00:02:43.630> this<00:02:44.070> test<00:02:45.070> case<00:02:45.610> of<00:02:45.880> ours<00:02:46.210> we're<00:02:46.870> just

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:46.960 
it in this test case of ours we're just

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:48.030 
it in this test case of ours we're just
going<00:02:47.140> to<00:02:47.200> put<00:02:47.290> the<00:02:47.380> screen<00:02:47.680> on<00:02:47.800> the<00:02:47.890> would

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:48.040 
going to put the screen on the would

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:50.520 
going to put the screen on the would
love<00:02:48.250> here<00:02:48.430> and<00:02:48.780> then<00:02:49.780> yeah<00:02:49.959> like<00:02:50.170> so<00:02:50.350> we'll

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:50.530 
love here and then yeah like so we'll

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:52.620 
love here and then yeah like so we'll
get<00:02:50.620> sassy<00:02:50.860> phone<00:02:51.550> switching<00:02:52.030> on<00:02:52.150> now<00:02:52.330> so<00:02:52.510> we

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:52.630 
get sassy phone switching on now so we

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:56.220 
get sassy phone switching on now so we
can<00:02:52.660> test<00:02:53.100> the<00:02:54.660> connector<00:02:55.660> six<00:02:55.930> in<00:02:56.110> number

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:56.230 
can test the connector six in number

00:02:56.230 --> 00:02:58.710 
can test the connector six in number
seven<00:02:56.830> that<00:02:57.580> they<00:02:58.270> are<00:02:58.390> in<00:02:58.510> the<00:02:58.600> new

00:02:58.710 --> 00:02:58.720 
seven that they are in the new
