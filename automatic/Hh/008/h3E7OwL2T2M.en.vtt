00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
health and also too we should talk about

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:12.920 
health and also too we should talk about
simply<00:01:10.950> why<00:01:11.310> we're<00:01:11.520> creating<00:01:11.850> it<00:01:11.939> raw<00:01:12.240> the

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930 
simply why we're creating it raw the

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:15.620 
simply why we're creating it raw the
best<00:01:13.170> reasons<00:01:13.650> for<00:01:13.950> creating<00:01:14.280> stuff<00:01:14.820> or<00:01:15.030> raw

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
best reasons for creating stuff or raw

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:18.289 
best reasons for creating stuff or raw
dishes<00:01:16.229> is<00:01:16.650> that<00:01:17.220> we<00:01:17.369> of<00:01:17.549> course<00:01:17.790> don't<00:01:18.000> heat

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:18.299 
dishes is that we of course don't heat

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:19.999 
dishes is that we of course don't heat
them<00:01:18.540> because<00:01:18.780> when<00:01:18.900> we<00:01:19.049> heat<00:01:19.259> them<00:01:19.439> we<00:01:19.619> do<00:01:19.770> two

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
them because when we heat them we do two

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:23.600 
them because when we heat them we do two
things<00:01:20.210> we<00:01:21.210> destroy<00:01:21.930> nutrition<00:01:22.650> the<00:01:23.130> longer

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 
things we destroy nutrition the longer

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:25.550 
things we destroy nutrition the longer
and<00:01:23.820> the<00:01:23.909> higher<00:01:24.090> the<00:01:24.330> heat<00:01:24.540> would<00:01:25.290> just<00:01:25.439> draw

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
and the higher the heat would just draw

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:28.219 
and the higher the heat would just draw
more<00:01:25.770> and<00:01:25.860> more<00:01:25.979> nutrition<00:01:26.580> and<00:01:26.909> also<00:01:27.450> heat

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
more and more nutrition and also heat

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:30.649 
more and more nutrition and also heat
destroys<00:01:28.619> enzymes<00:01:29.340> enzymes<00:01:29.640> are<00:01:30.299> in<00:01:30.420> food
