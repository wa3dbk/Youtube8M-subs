reflow 2013 and we are going to watch
how<00:00:05.339> to<00:00:05.370> create<00:00:05.790> a<00:00:05.910> Christopher<00:00:06.629> are<00:00:06.750> below

00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:06.990 
how to create a Christopher are below

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:09.259 
how to create a Christopher are below
where<00:00:07.170> the<00:00:07.980> filter<00:00:08.250> will<00:00:08.730> be<00:00:08.849> contained

00:00:09.259 --> 00:00:09.269 
where the filter will be contained

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:13.339 
where the filter will be contained
inside<00:00:09.660> of<00:00:09.870> a<00:00:10.110> container<00:00:10.969> okay<00:00:11.969> so<00:00:12.750> the<00:00:13.170> first

00:00:13.339 --> 00:00:13.349 
inside of a container okay so the first

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:15.530 
inside of a container okay so the first
thing<00:00:13.469> to<00:00:13.590> do<00:00:13.799> will<00:00:14.280> be<00:00:14.309> at<00:00:14.580> a<00:00:14.910> domain<00:00:15.210> in<00:00:15.360> their

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:15.540 
thing to do will be at a domain in their

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:17.920 
thing to do will be at a domain in their
relationship<00:00:16.139> editor<00:00:16.529> tape<00:00:17.160> in<00:00:17.340> the<00:00:17.430> main

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:17.930 
relationship editor tape in the main

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:21.109 
relationship editor tape in the main
okay<00:00:18.930> and<00:00:19.410> here's<00:00:19.710> my<00:00:19.830> domain<00:00:20.100> note<00:00:20.279> the

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:21.119 
okay and here's my domain note the

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:23.689 
okay and here's my domain note the
domain<00:00:21.390> note<00:00:21.600> will<00:00:22.320> be<00:00:22.350> the<00:00:22.470> most<00:00:22.830> basic<00:00:23.010> of<00:00:23.310> to

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:23.699 
domain note will be the most basic of to

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:26.870 
domain note will be the most basic of to
work<00:00:23.880> without<00:00:24.240> diluting<00:00:24.720> reflow<00:00:25.260> 2013<00:00:25.920> also

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:26.880 
work without diluting reflow 2013 also

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:28.820 
work without diluting reflow 2013 also
in<00:00:27.510> the<00:00:27.630> same<00:00:27.810> way<00:00:27.960> we<00:00:28.170> need<00:00:28.320> to<00:00:28.439> have<00:00:28.650> a

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:28.830 
in the same way we need to have a

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:30.589 
in the same way we need to have a
container<00:00:29.220> it<00:00:29.490> can<00:00:29.550> be<00:00:29.849> any<00:00:30.090> clothes<00:00:30.420> the

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:30.599 
container it can be any clothes the

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:32.269 
container it can be any clothes the
geometry<00:00:31.019> if<00:00:31.140> we<00:00:31.289> want<00:00:31.470> to<00:00:31.560> hold<00:00:31.740> the<00:00:31.920> flute<00:00:32.099> in

00:00:32.269 --> 00:00:32.279 
geometry if we want to hold the flute in

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:34.160 
geometry if we want to hold the flute in
a<00:00:32.399> specific<00:00:32.640> place<00:00:33.120> like<00:00:33.600> a<00:00:33.630> pool<00:00:33.899> for<00:00:34.110> example

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:34.170 
a specific place like a pool for example

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:37.370 
a specific place like a pool for example
so<00:00:35.070> in<00:00:35.309> this<00:00:35.460> occasion<00:00:36.270> the<00:00:36.719> container<00:00:37.200> will

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:37.380 
so in this occasion the container will

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:39.619 
so in this occasion the container will
be<00:00:37.410> a<00:00:37.530> simple<00:00:37.950> queue<00:00:38.190> and<00:00:38.370> we<00:00:39.090> need<00:00:39.239> to<00:00:39.329> connect

00:00:39.619 --> 00:00:39.629 
be a simple queue and we need to connect

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:41.090 
be a simple queue and we need to connect
it<00:00:39.719> within<00:00:39.960> the<00:00:40.140> main<00:00:40.290> because<00:00:40.649> if<00:00:40.770> we<00:00:40.890> will

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:41.100 
it within the main because if we will

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:45.590 
it within the main because if we will
collide<00:00:41.340> with<00:00:41.610> disk<00:00:42.000> you<00:00:42.350> okay<00:00:43.460> and<00:00:44.460> now<00:00:45.030> a<00:00:45.059> we

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600 
collide with disk you okay and now a we

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:47.299 
collide with disk you okay and now a we
need<00:00:45.690> to<00:00:45.840> indicate<00:00:46.020> what<00:00:46.469> tire<00:00:46.680> will<00:00:46.980> be<00:00:47.070> solid

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309 
need to indicate what tire will be solid

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:49.340 
need to indicate what tire will be solid
and<00:00:47.670> what<00:00:47.879> area<00:00:48.210> will<00:00:48.390> be<00:00:48.510> fluid<00:00:48.809> for<00:00:49.020> our<00:00:49.110> in

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
and what area will be fluid for our in

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:50.299 
and what area will be fluid for our in
China<00:00:49.620> okay

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:50.309 
China okay

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:52.580 
China okay
in<00:00:50.610> order<00:00:50.879> to<00:00:50.910> do<00:00:51.149> that<00:00:51.329> in<00:00:51.750> the<00:00:52.079> volume<00:00:52.379> tap

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:52.590 
in order to do that in the volume tap

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:55.729 
in order to do that in the volume tap
for<00:00:52.829> the<00:00:52.920> cue<00:00:53.129> object<00:00:53.629> we<00:00:54.629> choose<00:00:54.899> solid<00:00:55.590> or

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739 
for the cue object we choose solid or

site as volume mode okay so let's say so

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:05.000 
site as volume mode okay so let's say so
little<00:01:03.570> site<00:01:03.840> is<00:01:04.140> indicating<00:01:04.680> that<00:01:04.710> the

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
little site is indicating that the

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:07.190 
little site is indicating that the
outside<00:01:05.460> 400<00:01:05.820> and<00:01:06.060> China<00:01:06.270> will<00:01:06.570> be<00:01:06.659> solid<00:01:06.930> on

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
outside 400 and China will be solid on

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:09.350 
outside 400 and China will be solid on
the<00:01:07.290> fluid<00:01:07.500> warm<00:01:07.799> bid<00:01:08.010> are<00:01:08.220> only<00:01:08.520> inside<00:01:09.330> the

the fluid warm bid are only inside the
container<00:01:10.100> I'm<00:01:11.100> going<00:01:11.340> to<00:01:11.460> scale<00:01:11.820> up<00:01:11.970> with<00:01:12.180> a

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:12.299 
container I'm going to scale up with a

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:15.070 
container I'm going to scale up with a
cube<00:01:12.510> to<00:01:12.720> have<00:01:12.869> a<00:01:12.900> pick<00:01:13.320> a<00:01:13.350> container

cube to have a pick a container

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:19.300 
cube to have a pick a container
it<00:01:16.080> make<00:01:16.500> sure<00:01:16.580> when<00:01:17.580> we<00:01:18.299> are<00:01:18.450> importing

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:19.310 
it make sure when we are importing

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:21.980 
it make sure when we are importing
geometry<00:01:20.310> from<00:01:20.430> out<00:01:20.640> of<00:01:20.909> realflow<00:01:21.479> to<00:01:21.750> have

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
geometry from out of realflow to have

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:28.179 
geometry from out of realflow to have
the<00:01:22.320> coral<00:01:22.740> geometry<00:01:23.420> with<00:01:24.420> welded<00:01:25.290> vertex

00:01:28.179 --> 00:01:28.189 

00:01:28.189 --> 00:01:33.069 

okay<00:01:29.720> I'm<00:01:30.720> going<00:01:30.869> to<00:01:30.960> move<00:01:31.170> down<00:01:31.250> the<00:01:32.250> domain

00:01:33.069 --> 00:01:33.079 
okay I'm going to move down the domain

00:01:33.079 --> 00:01:36.830 
okay I'm going to move down the domain
is<00:01:34.079> no<00:01:34.950> necessary<00:01:35.189> issue<00:01:35.820> for<00:01:36.420> having<00:01:36.750> a

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840 
is no necessary issue for having a

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:39.920 
is no necessary issue for having a
kerosene<00:01:38.750> okay

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:39.930 
kerosene okay

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:42.889 
kerosene okay
I<00:01:40.610> also<00:01:41.610> we<00:01:42.000> need<00:01:42.119> to<00:01:42.240> create<00:01:42.450> the<00:01:42.689> emitter

00:01:42.889 --> 00:01:42.899 
I also we need to create the emitter

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:45.319 
I also we need to create the emitter
emitter<00:01:43.439> can<00:01:43.740> be<00:01:43.890> any<00:01:44.100> close<00:01:44.369> to<00:01:44.520> geometry<00:01:44.759> so

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:45.329 
emitter can be any close to geometry so

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:49.280 
emitter can be any close to geometry so
we<00:01:46.110> are<00:01:46.200> going<00:01:46.380> to<00:01:46.500> duplicate<00:01:47.450> the<00:01:48.450> cube

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:49.290 
we are going to duplicate the cube

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:53.569 
we are going to duplicate the cube
rename<00:01:50.130> the<00:01:50.280> notice<00:01:50.759> emitter<00:01:51.240> okay<00:01:52.079> and<00:01:52.579> Renee

00:01:53.569 --> 00:01:53.579 
rename the notice emitter okay and Renee

00:01:53.579 --> 00:02:01.459 
rename the notice emitter okay and Renee
first<00:01:54.240> Cuba's<00:01:54.750> container<00:01:56.509> okay<00:01:59.990> well<00:02:00.990> I<00:02:01.259> am

00:02:01.459 --> 00:02:01.469 
first Cuba's container okay well I am

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:03.620 
first Cuba's container okay well I am
going<00:02:02.040> to<00:02:02.159> a<00:02:02.189> scale<00:02:02.549> a<00:02:02.579> move<00:02:03.030> down<00:02:03.299> the

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:03.630 
going to a scale a move down the

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:09.010 
going to a scale a move down the
diameter<00:02:05.270> so

00:02:09.010 --> 00:02:09.020 

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:12.310 

it<00:02:09.620> is<00:02:10.370> necessary<00:02:11.210> to<00:02:11.690> connect<00:02:12.050> the<00:02:12.200> meter

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:12.320 
it is necessary to connect the meter

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:14.170 
it is necessary to connect the meter
with<00:02:12.650> the<00:02:12.770> domain<00:02:13.040> because<00:02:13.280> it<00:02:13.640> will<00:02:13.790> be<00:02:13.910> only

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:14.180 
with the domain because it will be only

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:15.850 
with the domain because it will be only
a<00:02:14.420> geometry<00:02:14.750> reference<00:02:15.440> for<00:02:15.710> the

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:15.860 
a geometry reference for the

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:19.150 
a geometry reference for the
arithmometer<00:02:16.630> in<00:02:17.630> this<00:02:17.840> case<00:02:18.080> is<00:02:18.560> letting<00:02:19.040> the

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:19.160 
arithmometer in this case is letting the

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:21.490 
arithmometer in this case is letting the
meter<00:02:19.340> geometry<00:02:19.820> will<00:02:20.150> type<00:02:20.390> a<00:02:20.630> meter<00:02:20.840> in<00:02:21.200> the

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:21.500 
meter geometry will type a meter in the

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:23.110 
meter geometry will type a meter in the
relationship<00:02:22.070> editor<00:02:22.430> and<00:02:22.640> choose<00:02:22.910> the

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:23.120 
relationship editor and choose the

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:26.290 
relationship editor and choose the
obrador<00:02:23.630> meter<00:02:23.840> node<00:02:24.170> so<00:02:25.010> here<00:02:25.820> is<00:02:25.940> the<00:02:26.090> node

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:26.300 
obrador meter node so here is the node

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:29.080 
obrador meter node so here is the node
and<00:02:26.600> the<00:02:27.350> meter<00:02:27.560> geometry<00:02:28.010> has<00:02:28.190> been<00:02:28.490> added

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:29.090 
and the meter geometry has been added

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:33.990 
and the meter geometry has been added
automatically<00:02:30.020> to<00:02:30.170> the<00:02:30.350> radiometer<00:02:31.540> okay

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:34.000 
automatically to the radiometer okay

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.880 
automatically to the radiometer okay
also<00:02:35.000> we<00:02:35.510> need<00:02:35.600> to<00:02:35.780> make<00:02:35.930> sure<00:02:35.960> that<00:02:36.260> the<00:02:36.710> meter

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:36.890 
also we need to make sure that the meter

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:38.980 
also we need to make sure that the meter
geometry<00:02:37.370> has<00:02:37.550> the<00:02:37.790> poly<00:02:38.030> mode<00:02:38.360> to<00:02:38.690> solid

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:38.990 
geometry has the poly mode to solid

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:43.300 
geometry has the poly mode to solid
inside<00:02:39.700> okay<00:02:40.750> it<00:02:41.750> is<00:02:41.990> because<00:02:42.320> the<00:02:42.470> fluid<00:02:42.800> will

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:43.310 
inside okay it is because the fluid will

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:48.210 
inside okay it is because the fluid will
be<00:02:43.340> a<00:02:43.460> metaphor<00:02:44.120> in<00:02:44.270> geometry<00:02:44.540> inside<00:02:46.060> okay

00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:48.220 
be a metaphor in geometry inside okay

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:50.920 
be a metaphor in geometry inside okay
debris<00:02:49.220> the<00:02:49.460> meter<00:02:49.670> will<00:02:50.240> need<00:02:50.510> to<00:02:50.810> be

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:50.930 
debris the meter will need to be

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:53.020 
debris the meter will need to be
connected<00:02:51.200> with<00:02:51.470> the<00:02:51.680> domain<00:02:51.920> to<00:02:52.130> emit<00:02:52.400> say

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:53.030 
connected with the domain to emit say

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:55.930 
connected with the domain to emit say
actually<00:02:53.870> any<00:02:54.110> bitter<00:02:54.410> note<00:02:54.680> will<00:02:55.490> need<00:02:55.670> to<00:02:55.820> be

00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:55.940 
actually any bitter note will need to be

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:59.190 
actually any bitter note will need to be
connected<00:02:56.180> with<00:02:56.420> the<00:02:56.600> domain<00:02:56.870> so<00:02:57.170> it<00:02:57.410> can<00:02:57.680> work

00:02:59.190 --> 00:02:59.200 
connected with the domain so it can work

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:02.500 
connected with the domain so it can work
now<00:03:00.200> if<00:03:00.860> we<00:03:01.190> say<00:03:01.580> that<00:03:01.610> the<00:03:01.850> original<00:03:02.240> domain

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:02.510 
now if we say that the original domain

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:07.000 
now if we say that the original domain
we<00:03:03.290> can<00:03:03.440> see<00:03:03.710> we<00:03:04.160> have<00:03:04.370> four<00:03:05.060> small<00:03:05.270> boxes<00:03:06.010> okay

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:07.010 
we can see we have four small boxes okay

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:09.100 
we can see we have four small boxes okay

and<00:06:53.740> I'm<00:06:54.740> going<00:06:54.949> to<00:06:55.039> check<00:06:55.370> the<00:06:55.580> option<00:06:56.000> to

00:06:56.110 --> 00:06:56.120 
and I'm going to check the option to

00:06:56.120 --> 00:06:57.879 
and I'm going to check the option to
simulate<00:06:56.300> become<00:06:56.810> aligned<00:06:57.110> and<00:06:57.380> this<00:06:57.590> ocean

00:06:57.879 --> 00:06:57.889 
simulate become aligned and this ocean

00:06:57.889 --> 00:07:00.939 
simulate become aligned and this ocean

00:07:07.330 --> 00:07:07.340 
Sinagua with the actual essay it will be

00:07:07.340 --> 00:07:10.000 
Sinagua with the actual essay it will be

00:07:16.420 --> 00:07:16.430 

00:07:16.430 --> 00:07:19.749 

okay<00:07:17.430> now<00:07:18.030> the<00:07:18.090> simulation<00:07:18.690> is<00:07:18.930> complete<00:07:19.020> and

00:07:19.749 --> 00:07:19.759 
okay now the simulation is complete and

00:07:19.759 --> 00:07:22.879 
okay now the simulation is complete and
once<00:07:20.759> it<00:07:21.090> is<00:07:21.120> simulated<00:07:21.449> we'll<00:07:22.110> legatee<00:07:22.740> and

00:07:22.879 --> 00:07:22.889 
once it is simulated we'll legatee and

00:07:22.889 --> 00:07:25.270 
once it is simulated we'll legatee and
go<00:07:23.009> to<00:07:23.070> the<00:07:23.310> frame<00:07:23.520> we<00:07:23.729> want<00:07:23.880> to<00:07:24.120> see<00:07:24.270> the<00:07:24.360> fluid

00:07:25.270 --> 00:07:25.280 
go to the frame we want to see the fluid

00:07:25.280 --> 00:07:30.230 
go to the frame we want to see the fluid
okay<00:07:26.479> we<00:07:27.479> can<00:07:27.750> my<00:07:27.930> file<00:07:28.229> a<00:07:28.259> display<00:07:28.770> to<00:07:29.699> paint<00:07:29.970> a

00:07:30.230 --> 00:07:30.240 
okay we can my file a display to paint a

00:07:30.240 --> 00:07:33.740 
okay we can my file a display to paint a
range<00:07:30.539> of<00:07:30.900> velocities<00:07:32.000> for<00:07:33.000> instance<00:07:33.330> my

00:07:33.740 --> 00:07:33.750 
range of velocities for instance my

00:07:33.750 --> 00:07:39.879 
range of velocities for instance my
friend<00:07:34.050> too<00:07:34.289> -<00:07:35.030> okay<00:07:36.030> of<00:07:36.210> higher<00:07:36.389> values<00:07:38.030> okay

00:07:39.879 --> 00:07:39.889 
friend too - okay of higher values okay

00:07:39.889 --> 00:07:43.070 
friend too - okay of higher values okay
but<00:07:40.889> I<00:07:41.250> will<00:07:41.490> if<00:07:41.610> the<00:07:41.820> default<00:07:42.120> value<00:07:42.389> -<00:07:42.570> to<00:07:42.960> me

00:07:43.070 --> 00:07:43.080 
but I will if the default value - to me

00:07:43.080 --> 00:07:47.790 
but I will if the default value - to me
deeper<00:07:43.350> in<00:07:43.560> this<00:07:43.650> case

00:07:47.790 --> 00:07:47.800 

00:07:47.800 --> 00:07:52.090 

the<00:07:48.800> previously<00:07:49.340> I<00:07:49.430> made<00:07:49.940> a<00:07:50.620> we<00:07:51.620> can<00:07:51.770> see<00:07:51.949> this

00:07:52.090 --> 00:07:52.100 
the previously I made a we can see this

00:07:52.100 --> 00:07:53.950 
the previously I made a we can see this
for<00:07:52.280> passing<00:07:52.729> through<00:07:52.880> the<00:07:53.030> future<00:07:53.419> how<00:07:53.690> it<00:07:53.870> is

00:07:53.950 --> 00:07:53.960 
for passing through the future how it is

00:07:53.960 --> 00:08:00.240 
for passing through the future how it is
writing<00:07:54.650> with<00:07:54.800> with<00:07:55.310> a<00:07:55.340> geometry<00:07:55.699> sir<00:07:58.870> okay

00:08:00.240 --> 00:08:00.250 
writing with with a geometry sir okay

00:08:00.250 --> 00:08:03.580 
writing with with a geometry sir okay
nice<00:08:01.250> it<00:08:01.580> thank<00:08:02.210> you<00:08:02.330> for<00:08:02.479> watching<00:08:02.900> and<00:08:03.169> enjoy

00:08:03.580 --> 00:08:03.590 
nice it thank you for watching and enjoy
