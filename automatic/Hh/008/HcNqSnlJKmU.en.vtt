00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:28.460 
stores beautifully in these bags and I

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:31.270 
stores beautifully in these bags and I
just<00:01:28.670> keep<00:01:28.850> a<00:01:28.940> bunch<00:01:29.119> of<00:01:29.330> them<00:01:29.860> it's<00:01:30.860> loaded

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:31.280 
just keep a bunch of them it's loaded

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:34.120 
just keep a bunch of them it's loaded
with<00:01:31.310> vitamin<00:01:31.820> C<00:01:32.090> and<00:01:32.390> if<00:01:32.540> you<00:01:32.659> had<00:01:32.869> to<00:01:33.229> live

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:34.130 
with vitamin C and if you had to live

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:36.609
