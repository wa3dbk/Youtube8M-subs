 hi friends today to success 21 

00:00:02.540 --> 00:00:06.600
 in this tutorial I will help you download and install the mx ix mode 

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:09.600
 san andreas I hope you pay close attention 

00:00:14.939 --> 00:00:17.230
 have the san andreas installed 

00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:21.410
 safer and recommended would be to have the full so the opponent does not grab 

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:24.410
 some motorbike to most 

00:00:27.899 --> 00:00:31.499
 to which they will see that I have the full so the opponent does not catch very well with 

00:00:31.499 --> 00:00:33.360
 some ways 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:37.370
 to download the full and the rib of san andreas I will leave clinic 

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:38.850
 video made by me 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:41.850
 in the description of the video 

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:45.700
 second 

00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:48.990
 have the mister ix moto to which I will also leave them in the description 

00:00:48.990 --> 00:00:53.300
 of the video good friends before testing the game told them that before 

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:56.560
 install the game save your previous saved files 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:00.690
 so if you install the modem and st-ericsson it will erase everything 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:02.800
 saved and you'll start from scratch 

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:07.250
 better to save and after installing everything place your saved files in 

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:11.710
 where it corresponds good friends now let's start to install it just follow the 

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:14.950
 recommended steps as it goes in the video and it will give you a good lorre 

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:28.400

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:03.500
 auto san andreas 

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:07.530
 to continue with the island nation we will put where our gt is 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:10.530
 a san andreas and we place next 

00:02:16.889 --> 00:02:20.759
 good friends I do not give it to the next because I already have it and its draft in the 

00:02:20.759 --> 00:02:22.089
 San Andreas 

00:02:22.089 --> 00:02:23.649
 for some reason 

00:02:23.649 --> 00:02:27.039
 I can lose the saved files that I have in the game 

00:02:27.629 --> 00:02:31.790
 but if you give the following if it will work after installing the 

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:34.759
 modem and st-ericsson will show you something like 

00:02:34.759 --> 00:02:37.759
 they give him in esti and to play 

00:02:54.279 --> 00:02:56.659
 do not forget to go to hold 

00:02:56.659 --> 00:03:00.339
 to san andreas' to be able to copy a shortcut in case some errors 

00:03:03.419 --> 00:03:06.419

00:03:56.629 --> 00:03:59.599
