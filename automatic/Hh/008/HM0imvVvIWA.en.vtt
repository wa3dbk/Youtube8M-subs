the number 12 is your number but again
you<00:04:52.439> have<00:04:52.469> to<00:04:52.650> understand<00:04:53.310> that<00:04:53.729> at<00:04:54.599> some

00:04:55.070 --> 00:04:55.080 
you have to understand that at some

00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:58.700 
you have to understand that at some
point<00:04:55.340> you<00:04:56.340> have<00:04:56.610> to<00:04:56.639> keep<00:04:56.969> trying<00:04:57.360> until<00:04:57.779> you

00:04:58.700 --> 00:04:58.710 
point you have to keep trying until you

00:04:58.710 --> 00:05:02.149 
point you have to keep trying until you
get<00:04:59.250> it<00:04:59.719> no<00:05:00.719> it's<00:05:01.139> not<00:05:01.229> an<00:05:01.529> option

00:05:02.149 --> 00:05:02.159 
get it no it's not an option

get it no it's not an option
tell<00:05:02.550> you<00:05:02.879> it's<00:05:03.150> not<00:05:03.389> a<00:05:03.449> net<00:05:03.750> is<00:05:04.169> not<00:05:04.199> an<00:05:04.710> option

00:05:05.179 --> 00:05:05.189 
tell you it's not a net is not an option

00:05:05.189 --> 00:05:06.439 
tell you it's not a net is not an option
it's<00:05:05.400> not<00:05:05.580> the<00:05:05.819> answer

00:05:06.439 --> 00:05:06.449 
it's not the answer

00:05:06.449 --> 00:05:08.899 
it's not the answer
so<00:05:06.810> again<00:05:07.199> forget<00:05:07.590> about<00:05:07.710> your<00:05:07.979> past<00:05:08.189> failure

so again forget about your past failure
there's<00:05:09.120> a<00:05:09.240> reason<00:05:09.689> why<00:05:10.650> your<00:05:10.889> rearview

00:05:11.209 --> 00:05:11.219 
there's a reason why your rearview

00:05:11.219 --> 00:05:14.330 
there's a reason why your rearview
mirror<00:05:11.759> is<00:05:12.060> is<00:05:12.779> this<00:05:13.199> big<00:05:13.560> now<00:05:13.949> if<00:05:14.099> you're<00:05:14.250> in<00:05:14.310> a

00:05:14.330 --> 00:05:14.340 
mirror is is this big now if you're in a

00:05:14.340 --> 00:05:16.279 
mirror is is this big now if you're in a
Cadillac<00:05:14.580> it<00:05:15.120> said<00:05:15.360> you<00:05:15.479> folks<00:05:15.719> in<00:05:15.870> five<00:05:16.080> head

00:05:16.279 --> 00:05:16.289 
Cadillac it said you folks in five head

00:05:16.289 --> 00:05:18.679 
Cadillac it said you folks in five head
of<00:05:16.379> leggings<00:05:16.620> might<00:05:16.830> that<00:05:17.009> be<00:05:17.069> but<00:05:17.610> again<00:05:17.729> most

00:05:18.679 --> 00:05:18.689 
of leggings might that be but again most

00:05:18.689 --> 00:05:22.219 
of leggings might that be but again most
rearview<00:05:19.500> mirrors<00:05:20.219> is<00:05:20.729> about<00:05:21.599> that<00:05:21.750> big<00:05:21.990> and

00:05:22.219 --> 00:05:22.229 
rearview mirrors is about that big and

00:05:22.229 --> 00:05:25.399 
rearview mirrors is about that big and
again<00:05:22.770> your<00:05:23.219> big<00:05:23.460> windshield<00:05:24.089> is<00:05:24.300> that<00:05:24.810> big<00:05:25.139> is

00:05:25.399 --> 00:05:25.409 
again your big windshield is that big is

00:05:25.409 --> 00:05:27.619 
again your big windshield is that big is
that<00:05:25.919> why<00:05:26.159> there's<00:05:26.879> a<00:05:26.939> reason<00:05:27.240> why<00:05:27.330> it's<00:05:27.509> so

00:05:27.619 --> 00:05:27.629 
that why there's a reason why it's so

00:05:27.629 --> 00:05:29.779 
that why there's a reason why it's so
small<00:05:27.990> compared<00:05:28.770> to<00:05:28.979> what's<00:05:29.189> in<00:05:29.310> front<00:05:29.339> of<00:05:29.669> you

00:05:29.779 --> 00:05:29.789 
small compared to what's in front of you

00:05:29.789 --> 00:05:31.730 
small compared to what's in front of you
being<00:05:29.999> that<00:05:30.240> big<00:05:30.449> there's<00:05:30.930> a<00:05:31.020> reason<00:05:31.319> for<00:05:31.349> that

00:05:31.730 --> 00:05:31.740 
being that big there's a reason for that

00:05:31.740 --> 00:05:34.010 
being that big there's a reason for that
so<00:05:31.979> again<00:05:32.310> we're<00:05:32.729> going<00:05:32.939> to<00:05:33.180> make<00:05:33.330> three<00:05:33.569> again

00:05:34.010 --> 00:05:34.020 
so again we're going to make three again
