00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:42.850 
perfect size for car to go into the very

00:04:42.850 --> 00:04:50.920 
perfect size for car to go into the very
okay<00:04:45.010> next<00:04:46.010> we<00:04:46.550> have<00:04:46.580> got<00:04:46.700> this<00:04:49.060> medium<00:04:50.060> it<00:04:50.900> is

00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:50.930 
okay next we have got this medium it is

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:56.129 
okay next we have got this medium it is
the<00:04:51.729> XO<00:04:52.729> Terra<00:04:53.060> Raptor<00:04:53.660> reptile<00:04:54.289> cave<00:04:54.919> large

00:04:56.129 --> 00:04:56.139 
the XO Terra Raptor reptile cave large

00:04:56.139 --> 00:04:59.980 
the XO Terra Raptor reptile cave large
and<00:04:57.139> I<00:04:57.260> really<00:04:57.800> like<00:04:58.010> it<00:04:58.190> it's<00:04:58.310> quite<00:04:58.550> flat<00:04:58.990> the

00:04:59.980 --> 00:04:59.990 
and I really like it it's quite flat the

00:04:59.990 --> 00:05:01.779 
and I really like it it's quite flat the
reason<00:05:00.260> I<00:05:00.349> like<00:05:00.470> that<00:05:00.500> so<00:05:00.740> much<00:05:00.800> is<00:05:01.400> because<00:05:01.610> it

00:05:01.779 --> 00:05:01.789 
reason I like that so much is because it

00:05:01.789 --> 00:05:03.879 
reason I like that so much is because it
kind<00:05:02.150> of<00:05:02.270> serves<00:05:02.599> two<00:05:02.870> purposes<00:05:02.900> the<00:05:03.680> snake

00:05:03.879 --> 00:05:03.889 
kind of serves two purposes the snake

00:05:03.889 --> 00:05:06.520 
kind of serves two purposes the snake
can<00:05:04.099> go<00:05:04.370> in<00:05:04.550> through<00:05:05.000> here<00:05:05.240> and<00:05:05.479> be<00:05:05.660> secure<00:05:05.990> and

00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:06.530 
can go in through here and be secure and

00:05:06.530 --> 00:05:09.129 
can go in through here and be secure and
can<00:05:06.770> also<00:05:06.950> lie<00:05:07.669> on<00:05:07.820> top<00:05:08.090> because<00:05:08.510> it's<00:05:08.900> quite

00:05:09.129 --> 00:05:09.139 
can also lie on top because it's quite

00:05:09.139 --> 00:05:10.629 
can also lie on top because it's quite
flat<00:05:09.380> and<00:05:09.410> also<00:05:09.830> put<00:05:09.979> the<00:05:10.070> heat<00:05:10.190> quite<00:05:10.400> nicely

00:05:10.629 --> 00:05:10.639 
flat and also put the heat quite nicely

00:05:10.639 --> 00:05:13.060 
flat and also put the heat quite nicely
which<00:05:11.150> is<00:05:11.300> why<00:05:11.450> I<00:05:11.479> really<00:05:11.900> like<00:05:12.050> these<00:05:12.229> paper

00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:13.070 
which is why I really like these paper

00:05:13.070 --> 00:05:14.040 
which is why I really like these paper

can see it's high and deep which will

00:05:27.950 --> 00:05:30.350 
can see it's high and deep which will
mean<00:05:28.099> they<00:05:28.250> all<00:05:28.400> make<00:05:28.610> a<00:05:28.639> perfect<00:05:29.090> fit<00:05:29.300> for
