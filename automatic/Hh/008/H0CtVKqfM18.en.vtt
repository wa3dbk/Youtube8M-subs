00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:09.370
 the garra fanini are nice 

00:00:06.670 --> 00:00:12.250
 evergreen perennials that yes 

00:00:09.370 --> 00:00:14.379
 they can also cultivate invaded and each 

00:00:12.250 --> 00:00:17.320
 year they give us vivid blooms a 

00:00:14.379 --> 00:00:19.090
 sometimes even nicely scented they are 

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:21.279
 of easy cultivation we see together 

00:00:19.090 --> 00:00:23.619
 the care they need 

00:00:21.279 --> 00:00:25.390
 once purchased the plants in 

00:00:23.619 --> 00:00:27.580
 genus and are found in the of vaio the 

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:30.400
 garden in the spring we will go to 

00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:32.579
 repot based on size and more 

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:35.560
 big we can also predict 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:38.199
 different color compositions 

00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:40.840
 then we fill the jar with the 

00:00:38.199 --> 00:00:43.539
 specific soil for flowering plants 

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:45.039
 blue man and thor fi at the bottom of the vase 

00:00:43.539 --> 00:00:47.920
 we have previously put 

00:00:45.039 --> 00:00:51.160
 of expanded clay to avoid 

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:55.780
 then the water stagnation remains 

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:58.269
 we're going to make a hole more or less than 

00:00:55.780 --> 00:01:01.300
 size of the earth bread of the 

00:00:58.269 --> 00:01:08.890
 plant purchased and we place the 

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:12.340
 plant in the pot this way here 

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:15.090
 we fill the remaining spaces with the vase 

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:15.090
 with soil 

00:01:28.159 --> 00:01:47.149
 let us fight the ground and then recall 

00:01:43.759 --> 00:01:50.759
 to favor the engraftment of the 

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:53.039
 plant we treat the soil with alga ton 

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:57.770
 specialty based on seaweed 

00:01:53.039 --> 00:02:07.940
 we dilute the dose indicated on the label 

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:11.160
 in water and with the solution more recall 

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:12.959
 the terrain 

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:16.799
 in this way the seedlings will grow 

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:18.780
 without stress, stronger and stronger we will go 

00:02:16.799 --> 00:02:21.239
 at this point to position the carnations 

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:22.590
 in a corner of the balcony of the terrace 

00:02:21.239 --> 00:02:26.190
 sunny and possibly even 

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:29.609
 ventilated also withstand the sun and 

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:31.980
 direct in case of low light the 

00:02:29.609 --> 00:02:33.810
 plant will not have an optimal development e 

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:36.569
 flowers and will have less colors e 

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:38.190
 brilliants does not tolerate temperatures 

00:02:36.569 --> 00:02:41.190
 less than 10 degrees 

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:43.230
 remove high temperatures instead e 

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:44.519
 mobile phones are plants that 

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:48.480
 kind exist very well 

00:02:44.519 --> 00:02:52.079
 to pollution and saltiness 

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:54.810
 while a poor drainage and shade 

00:02:52.079 --> 00:02:57.870
 excessive can cause damage 

00:02:54.810 --> 00:03:00.480
 to the plant they are perennials but in 

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:03.150
 general after autumn tend to 

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:05.519
 lose and dry to lose then for 

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:09.329
 flowers and leaves to then push the 

00:03:05.519 --> 00:03:11.940
 spring and next the carnations e 

00:03:09.329 --> 00:03:14.060
 they are less demanding plants and in 

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:16.889
 water does not require irrigation 

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:19.560
 frequent in the summer in the presence of 

00:03:16.889 --> 00:03:22.049
 high temperatures water when the 

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:24.630
 soil is dry in winter instead 

00:03:22.049 --> 00:03:26.849
 the rains will be enough 

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:29.160
 avoid stagnation of water or soil 

00:03:26.849 --> 00:03:32.819
 very soaked as they can 

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:33.640
 lead to the development of rot is 

00:03:32.819 --> 00:03:35.980
 very important 

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:38.200
 however many provide the plants with i 

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:39.760
 nutrients and specific and this 

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:41.350
 through fertilization we can 

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:44.170
 choose to consume with the fertilizer 

00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:46.090
 liquid large green flowering plants like 

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:52.020
 our case it is a plant 

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:56.190
 in pot by diluting the dose of use in 

00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:59.260
 water and irrigating the ground or 

00:03:56.190 --> 00:04:02.050
 spraying the solution obtained e 

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:03.760
 on the leaves or if you choose to 

00:04:02.050 --> 00:04:06.150
 cultivate their fans in the open ground 

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:08.980
 we can also use the fertilizer 

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:11.080
 water-soluble specific for geraniums e 

00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:14.440
 flowering plants also in this case 

00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:16.329
 enough to dilute the dosage obtained on 

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:19.510
 dosage indicated on the label in water 

00:04:16.329 --> 00:04:21.850
 and precisely to irrigate the ideal soil 

00:04:19.510 --> 00:04:23.830
 fanini I suffer from the attack of the foster families 

00:04:21.850 --> 00:04:25.360
 infestations begin in the genus in 

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:28.300
 spring is therefore always convenient 

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:30.790
 check well and the plants insects 

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:34.120
 they will go to place on the leaves and 

00:04:30.790 --> 00:04:36.340
 on the flowers they suck the sap r not the 

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:38.770
 sticky plant later precisely 

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:41.620
 to the emission of honeydew they produce 

00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:43.450
 during stings in the presence of these 

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:46.810
 annoying insects we use 

00:04:43.450 --> 00:04:49.150
 the specific insecticide ready for use e 

00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:51.760
 c for block in stations instead 

00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:54.360
 particularly adverse to the seedlings 

00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:56.860
 they can be damaged by snails 

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:59.200
 especially the seedlings grown in 

00:04:56.860 --> 00:05:02.020
 full ground to prevent attack 

00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:03.760
 of snails or to eliminate them 

00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:08.140
 we're going to spread the 

00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:10.270
 matricide luna block to always have 

00:05:08.140 --> 00:05:11.729
 of beautiful plants and stimulate 

00:05:10.270 --> 00:05:15.850
 always issuing new flowers 

00:05:11.729 --> 00:05:18.030
 we are going to eliminate those that 

00:05:15.850 --> 00:05:20.220
 they dry up as they detach 

00:05:18.030 --> 00:05:22.870
 we use scissors well 

00:05:20.220 --> 00:05:25.539
 disinfected and cleaned and precisely e 

00:05:22.870 --> 00:05:29.280
 let's get rid of the dried man flowers 

00:05:25.539 --> 00:05:29.280
 hand that dries up
