00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:35.620 
splinter and I roughened up the paint
texture<00:02:32.780> as<00:02:32.960> you<00:02:33.560> can<00:02:33.740> see<00:02:34.090> some<00:02:35.090> of<00:02:35.210> this<00:02:35.300> wood

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:35.630 
texture as you can see some of this wood

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:39.970 
texture as you can see some of this wood
that<00:02:35.930> was<00:02:36.610> painted<00:02:37.610> by<00:02:38.210> whoever<00:02:38.570> owned<00:02:38.980> the

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:39.980 
that was painted by whoever owned the

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:42.850 
that was painted by whoever owned the
building<00:02:40.400> this<00:02:40.520> was<00:02:40.760> on<00:02:40.970> was<00:02:41.840> very<00:02:42.410> weathered

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:42.860 
building this was on was very weathered

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:45.280 
building this was on was very weathered
and<00:02:43.220> raised<00:02:43.580> the<00:02:44.000> grain<00:02:44.270> was<00:02:44.480> raised<00:02:44.870> quite<00:02:45.230> a

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:45.290 
and raised the grain was raised quite a

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:47.440 
and raised the grain was raised quite a
bit<00:02:45.530> so<00:02:45.800> this<00:02:46.400> is<00:02:46.490> going<00:02:46.610> to<00:02:46.700> really<00:02:46.850> be<00:02:47.120> a<00:02:47.150> fun

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:47.450 
bit so this is going to really be a fun

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:51.070 
bit so this is going to really be a fun
project<00:02:47.690> to<00:02:48.250> use<00:02:49.250> this<00:02:49.520> for<00:02:49.910> and<00:02:50.300> the

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:51.080 
project to use this for and the

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:54.970 
project to use this for and the
technique<00:02:51.860> that<00:02:51.890> I've<00:02:52.900> seen<00:02:53.900> by<00:02:54.260> Shane<00:02:54.620> and

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:54.980 
technique that I've seen by Shane and

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:57.430 
technique that I've seen by Shane and
and<00:02:55.280> others<00:02:55.700> is<00:02:56.000> to<00:02:56.030> use<00:02:56.390> other<00:02:56.780> color<00:02:57.110> pane

00:02:57.430 --> 00:02:57.440 
and others is to use other color pane

00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:00.520 
and others is to use other color pane
and<00:02:57.680> I<00:02:57.800> just<00:02:58.010> have<00:02:58.220> some<00:02:58.550> red<00:02:59.540> paint<00:02:59.840> it's<00:03:00.170> just

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:00.530 
and I just have some red paint it's just

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:03.580 
and I just have some red paint it's just
this<00:03:01.220> kind<00:03:01.489> of<00:03:01.610> acrylic<00:03:02.150> paint<00:03:02.390> that<00:03:03.230> you<00:03:03.260> can

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:03.590 
this kind of acrylic paint that you can

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:05.600 
get and I'm going to rub that all over

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:09.610 
get and I'm going to rub that all over
these<00:03:06.320> pieces<00:03:06.590> and<00:03:07.010> let<00:03:07.760> it<00:03:07.880> dry<00:03:08.180> wipe<00:03:08.930> off<00:03:09.170> you

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:09.620 
these pieces and let it dry wipe off you

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:11.530 
these pieces and let it dry wipe off you
know<00:03:09.770> a<00:03:09.800> lot<00:03:10.040> of<00:03:10.070> the<00:03:10.250> excess<00:03:10.580> let<00:03:10.880> it<00:03:11.000> dry<00:03:11.239> and

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:11.540 
know a lot of the excess let it dry and

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:13.300 
know a lot of the excess let it dry and
then<00:03:11.930> we'll<00:03:12.050> sand<00:03:12.380> it<00:03:12.500> one<00:03:12.650> more<00:03:12.800> time<00:03:13.040> and

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:13.310 
then we'll sand it one more time and

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:25.300 
then we'll sand it one more time and
we'll<00:03:14.060> be<00:03:14.239> ready<00:03:14.390> for<00:03:14.750> assembly<00:03:14.959> I<00:03:24.310> sanded

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:25.310 
we'll be ready for assembly I sanded

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:27.699 
we'll be ready for assembly I sanded
down<00:03:25.370> with<00:03:25.910> the<00:03:26.120> red<00:03:26.480> paint<00:03:26.750> applied<00:03:27.140> and<00:03:27.530> I've

00:03:27.699 --> 00:03:27.709 
down with the red paint applied and I've

00:03:27.709 --> 00:03:29.949 
down with the red paint applied and I've
gotten<00:03:28.160> this<00:03:28.370> effect<00:03:28.850> it's<00:03:29.480> a<00:03:29.660> little

00:03:29.949 --> 00:03:29.959 
gotten this effect it's a little

00:03:29.959 --> 00:03:32.800 
gotten this effect it's a little
different<00:03:30.200> from<00:03:30.530> what<00:03:30.769> I<00:03:30.799> expected<00:03:31.750> but<00:03:32.750> I

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:32.810 
different from what I expected but I

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:36.520 
different from what I expected but I
think<00:03:33.110> I<00:03:33.230> like<00:03:33.440> it<00:03:33.680> it<00:03:34.930> kinda<00:03:35.930> looks<00:03:36.170> like<00:03:36.260> it

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:36.530 
think I like it it kinda looks like it

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:39.699 
think I like it it kinda looks like it
was<00:03:36.680> painted<00:03:36.920> red<00:03:37.340> at<00:03:37.760> one<00:03:37.790> time<00:03:38.180> and<00:03:38.600> white<00:03:39.320> at

00:03:39.699 --> 00:03:39.709 
was painted red at one time and white at

00:03:39.709 --> 00:03:43.960 
was painted red at one time and white at
one<00:03:39.890> time<00:03:40.360> so<00:03:41.709> came<00:03:42.709> out<00:03:42.890> like<00:03:43.100> this<00:03:43.340> anyway

00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:43.970 
one time so came out like this anyway

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:47.140 
one time so came out like this anyway
it's<00:03:44.870> for<00:03:45.110> a<00:03:45.170> crate<00:03:45.620> for<00:03:45.890> pete's<00:03:46.100> sake<00:03:46.310> it

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:47.150 
it's for a crate for pete's sake it

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:48.699 
it's for a crate for pete's sake it
really<00:03:47.420> doesn't<00:03:47.780> matter<00:03:47.959> that<00:03:48.140> much<00:03:48.320> what<00:03:48.650> it

00:03:48.699 --> 00:03:48.709 
really doesn't matter that much what it

00:03:48.709 --> 00:03:51.039 
really doesn't matter that much what it
looks<00:03:48.890> like<00:03:49.130> but<00:03:50.090> I<00:03:50.150> think<00:03:50.239> it<00:03:50.480> looks<00:03:50.660> kind<00:03:50.989> of

00:03:51.039 --> 00:03:51.049 
looks like but I think it looks kind of

00:03:51.049 --> 00:03:57.430 
looks like but I think it looks kind of
like<00:03:51.200> it<00:03:51.410> was<00:03:51.530> on<00:03:51.739> a<00:03:51.769> barn<00:03:52.130> at<00:03:52.340> one<00:03:52.489> time<00:03:56.410> put<00:03:57.410> a

00:03:57.430 --> 00:03:57.440 
like it was on a barn at one time put a

00:03:57.440 --> 00:03:59.789 
like it was on a barn at one time put a
little<00:03:57.620> glue<00:03:57.860> on<00:03:57.890> the<00:03:58.190> middle<00:03:58.519> of<00:03:58.610> each<00:03:58.790> one

00:03:59.789 --> 00:03:59.799 
little glue on the middle of each one

00:03:59.799 --> 00:04:29.580 
little glue on the middle of each one
should<00:04:00.799> be<00:04:00.860> fine

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:29.590 

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:32.350 

I'll<00:04:30.590> just<00:04:30.830> repeat<00:04:31.280> that<00:04:31.310> around<00:04:31.880> the<00:04:32.090> crate

00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:32.360 
I'll just repeat that around the crate

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:36.280 
I'll just repeat that around the crate
and<00:04:32.600> we'll<00:04:32.900> get<00:04:33.140> it<00:04:33.230> assembled<00:04:35.050> all<00:04:36.050> right

00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:36.290 
and we'll get it assembled all right

00:04:36.290 --> 00:04:46.120 
and we'll get it assembled all right
there<00:04:43.810> I'll<00:04:44.810> do<00:04:44.960> that<00:04:45.170> on<00:04:45.320> the<00:04:45.440> other<00:04:45.530> side<00:04:45.860> and

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:46.130 
there I'll do that on the other side and

00:04:46.130 --> 00:04:50.770 
there I'll do that on the other side and
we'll<00:04:46.250> get<00:04:46.400> the<00:04:46.490> bottom<00:04:46.820> stall<00:04:49.240> okay<00:04:50.240> it's<00:04:50.660> a

00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:50.780 
we'll get the bottom stall okay it's a

00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:54.670 
we'll get the bottom stall okay it's a
little<00:04:51.080> cup<00:04:51.350> these<00:04:52.340> boards<00:04:52.790> are<00:04:53.380> but<00:04:54.380> who

00:04:54.670 --> 00:04:54.680 
little cup these boards are but who

00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:59.680 
little cup these boards are but who
cares<00:04:55.010> let's<00:04:55.370> just<00:04:55.640> for<00:04:56.380> box<00:04:57.380> here<00:04:57.800> so<00:04:58.690> like

00:04:59.680 --> 00:04:59.690 
cares let's just for box here so like

00:04:59.690 --> 00:05:01.030 
cares let's just for box here so like
that<00:04:59.930> we'll<00:05:00.140> put<00:05:00.290> a<00:05:00.350> few<00:05:00.500> Brad's<00:05:00.770> in<00:05:00.920> the

00:05:01.030 --> 00:05:01.040 
that we'll put a few Brad's in the

00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:03.400 
that we'll put a few Brad's in the
bottom<00:05:01.460> maybe<00:05:02.090> some<00:05:02.540> from<00:05:02.750> the<00:05:02.900> sides<00:05:03.170> and

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:03.410 
bottom maybe some from the sides and

00:05:03.410 --> 00:05:06.130 
bottom maybe some from the sides and
we'll<00:05:04.220> basically<00:05:05.030> be<00:05:05.510> done<00:05:05.750> with<00:05:05.960> the

00:05:06.130 --> 00:05:06.140 
we'll basically be done with the

00:05:06.140 --> 00:05:12.760 
we'll basically be done with the
assembly<00:05:10.750> this<00:05:11.750> box<00:05:12.110> will<00:05:12.320> work<00:05:12.530> out<00:05:12.740> just

00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:12.770 
assembly this box will work out just

00:05:12.770 --> 00:05:16.840 
assembly this box will work out just
fine<00:05:13.190> I<00:05:14.200> posted<00:05:15.200> a<00:05:15.380> short<00:05:15.410> video<00:05:15.980> on<00:05:16.160> my<00:05:16.490> keek

00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:16.850 
fine I posted a short video on my keek

00:05:16.850 --> 00:05:19.300 
fine I posted a short video on my keek
account<00:05:17.360> and<00:05:17.660> somebody<00:05:18.560> said<00:05:18.890> they<00:05:19.070> thought

00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:19.310 
account and somebody said they thought

00:05:19.310 --> 00:05:21.970 
account and somebody said they thought
the<00:05:19.520> paint<00:05:19.790> job<00:05:20.060> looked<00:05:20.390> like<00:05:20.510> bacon<00:05:21.290> so<00:05:21.950> I

00:05:21.970 --> 00:05:21.980 
the paint job looked like bacon so I

00:05:21.980 --> 00:05:25.540 
the paint job looked like bacon so I
guess<00:05:22.400> the<00:05:23.150> bacon<00:05:23.570> box<00:05:23.810> complete<00:05:24.410> it'll<00:05:25.250> get<00:05:25.520> a

00:05:25.540 --> 00:05:25.550 
guess the bacon box complete it'll get a

00:05:25.550 --> 00:05:28.390 
guess the bacon box complete it'll get a
lot<00:05:25.790> of<00:05:25.940> good<00:05:26.120> use<00:05:26.710> thanks<00:05:27.710> for<00:05:27.890> watching
