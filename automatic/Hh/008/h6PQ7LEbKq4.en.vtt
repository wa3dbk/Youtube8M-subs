00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.740
 Hi guys, I've been taking a step to 

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:11.910
 step of this bag I made this is a 

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:14.040
 but I have no baggage 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:18.270
 time I wanted to make another bag and 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:19.920
 record everything so step by step 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:21.990
 doing is not ordinary 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:25.109
 I'm late, I 'll do the following. 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:27.300
 I'll go pro cesa meditates that the fact 

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:30.150
 It's what I did on top of the mold that I did 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:33.329
 and then I'll pass the video link that 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:35.250
 I took this bag was in a program 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:38.430
 of tv 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:42.239
 so I'm going to take the steps I 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:46.200
 I have done to scholarship here what I did I 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:48.739
 I grabbed a piece of cardboard and brings in 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:53.430
 a rectangle where he had 39 

00:00:48.739 --> 00:00:55.230
 inches wide by 35 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:58.859
 inches tall 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:01:01.530
 I made a rectangle of 39 by 35 

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:06.780
 then I found the middle of that rectangle 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:10.140
 divides into 17 formed half 17 the other 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:13.740
 Finding half here and I passed this line 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:17.700
 as I also traced on the belt, so I did 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:20.700
 a cross here from the middle of the part 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:22.830
 What is it like to be a 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:25.409
 this white part is the part 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:26.939
 which is symbolizing a rectangle 

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:30.030
 they were there and month 

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:33.329
 So from that top I found that 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:36.299
 a diagonal I took a diagonal of this 

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:37.290
 top that stayed in 2 and so many 

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:42.509
 smaller 

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:44.670
 measure diagonally and measure is 18 centimeters 

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:48.750
 half and mark a point 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:51.299
 in this middle line I marked the middle and 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:55.409
 in this line that the 17 6 

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:58.579
 hence I did with the free hand and rounded 

00:01:55.409 --> 00:02:02.850
 here and I cut then she stayed 

00:01:58.579 --> 00:02:09.069
 This way, it 's the bag. 

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:13.540
 part of the bag from here that page 

00:02:09.069 --> 00:02:22.090
 in front and back they got this 

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:25.989
 measure that was 39 by 35 to half of it 

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:28.859
 straight and half up I rounded 

00:02:25.989 --> 00:02:32.709
 making the goal I said I found a diagonal 

00:02:28.859 --> 00:02:37.030
 measures eight and a half and risquÃ© munir 

00:02:32.709 --> 00:02:40.870
 so this was the measure of the part of the 

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:47.109
 front and back for the measurement of 

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:50.739
 background that goes from here to make easy 

00:02:47.109 --> 00:02:55.180
 background and come here and I cut a cloth 

00:02:50.739 --> 00:03:02.370
 17 centimeters by 70 in length 

00:02:55.180 --> 00:03:07.719
 by fabric on the blanket in the lining and top 

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:12.099
 for the cyber what I did I cut it 

00:03:07.719 --> 00:03:16.750
 two centimeters of the fabric of the 

00:03:12.099 --> 00:03:19.449
 top of the liner and the mantle tissue and 

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:22.030
 video will see that it has no bias I wanted 

00:03:19.449 --> 00:03:26.019
 so listen for bias 

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:28.569
 I cut bias four centimeters in one 

00:03:26.019 --> 00:03:29.530
 strip four centimeters by 60 

00:03:28.569 --> 00:03:34.780
 feeling 

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:36.310
 I used the 60 zipper to feel the handle I did 

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:40.239
 commands 

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:44.560
 I cut the blanket from what I did until 

00:03:40.239 --> 00:03:50.609
 here for you I cut the blanket of three 

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:55.719
 centimeters and a half by 60 in length 

00:03:50.609 --> 00:04:00.069
 and to the fabric that wrapped this blanket 

00:03:55.719 --> 00:04:02.879
 I cut 60 in length by 12 6 

00:04:00.069 --> 00:04:08.379
 so here are the measurements I made 

00:04:02.879 --> 00:04:12.579
 zipper 60 by 8 twice that one side is 

00:04:08.379 --> 00:04:17.669
 here one side and another and another bias 24 

00:04:12.579 --> 00:04:17.669
 centimeters percent also twice 

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:24.710
 is the bottom part of 17 by 70 

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:29.450
 manta for reader 

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:35.980
 the cuffs the 36 year old 60 and the fabric 

00:04:29.450 --> 00:04:35.980
 if it is the fabric was 12 medium by itself 

00:04:44.479 --> 00:04:50.190
 I'll give her a link. 

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:52.620
 that will be well explained 

00:04:50.190 --> 00:04:53.880
 differences is the extent that anime 

00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:57.300
 edit another 

00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:58.590
 the other thing I put in my two 

00:04:57.300 --> 00:05:02.639
 courses 

00:04:58.590 --> 00:05:05.430
 so I love with two courses I come 

00:05:02.639 --> 00:05:07.470
 how until now and until this is the 

00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:08.910
 criterion of each student I find it easier 

00:05:07.470 --> 00:05:11.310
 put two 

00:05:08.910 --> 00:05:15.539
 I put this to yes here also that 

00:05:11.310 --> 00:05:19.650
 have the video and parsley 

00:05:15.539 --> 00:05:22.229
 time to pull those who want to put can 

00:05:19.650 --> 00:05:26.580
 put and put this little piece here 

00:05:22.229 --> 00:05:29.550
 complete on the huse part 

00:05:26.580 --> 00:05:32.400
 only in the part of z this also does not need 

00:05:29.550 --> 00:05:33.960
 in the video there is no more if someone wants me 

00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:35.099
 I thought it was more cute, this one. 

00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:38.669
 detail 

00:05:35.099 --> 00:05:43.409
 Good people, the purse so ready, she stayed 

00:05:38.669 --> 00:05:50.849
 with 36 

00:05:43.409 --> 00:05:53.400
 the 40 and the width of 16 

00:05:50.849 --> 00:05:56.330
 now I have put on a team clothes without 

00:05:53.400 --> 00:05:59.460
 notion of what is the capacity of 

00:05:56.330 --> 00:06:02.610
 clothes you want to carry in this bag do not 

00:05:59.460 --> 00:06:04.440
 I took precious pieces you see that 

00:06:02.610 --> 00:06:08.280
 she fits a lot 

00:06:04.440 --> 00:06:12.990
 the sweater in very thick stone uses quim 

00:06:08.280 --> 00:06:17.219
 ax but a pair of pants 

00:06:12.990 --> 00:06:22.590
 jeans other jeans and a pair of pants 

00:06:17.219 --> 00:06:25.380
 thick jeans and even a bag with the 

00:06:22.590 --> 00:06:28.680
 sneakers and I forgot to talk to you 

00:06:25.380 --> 00:06:31.740
 she has a hell of a lot of pockets 

00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:37.500
 or do they need a hilton hotel 

00:06:31.740 --> 00:06:40.639
 very good here in the inside 

00:06:37.500 --> 00:06:43.949
 in the video that you'll see after he 

00:06:40.639 --> 00:06:45.030
 I have 11 goals so I decided to put more 

00:06:43.949 --> 00:06:48.260
 goals 

00:06:45.030 --> 00:06:51.420
 Sometimes they want to use this bag to 

00:06:48.260 --> 00:06:54.870
 going out doing something by day had to 

00:06:51.420 --> 00:06:57.600
 But I made it measure the size of a 

00:06:54.870 --> 00:07:01.200
 Fish word ruler and had it in your pocket 

00:06:57.600 --> 00:07:03.900
 I put the veil on facebook already 

00:07:01.200 --> 00:07:06.420
 closed at home and a ruler here 

00:07:03.900 --> 00:07:08.790
 on one side so I made it big 

00:07:06.420 --> 00:07:11.880
 On the other side I did more 

00:07:08.790 --> 00:07:14.820
 I did not do the same thing 

00:07:11.880 --> 00:07:19.050
 split here only I passed stitching 

00:07:14.820 --> 00:07:22.140
 so she gives me the cutter she gives 

00:07:19.050 --> 00:07:25.470
 for me with scissors 

00:07:22.140 --> 00:07:29.370
 She gives me a tape measure. 

00:07:25.470 --> 00:07:30.630
 I'm going to roll a ribbon or pin 

00:07:29.370 --> 00:07:33.330
 anything else you want 

00:07:30.630 --> 00:07:36.090
 here and in time a pocket here in 

00:07:33.330 --> 00:07:38.760
 Up you can by cellphone whatever you want 

00:07:36.090 --> 00:07:41.580
 this part does not have in the video but this 

00:07:38.760 --> 00:07:43.710
 bag that has and just does not have the sky 

00:07:41.580 --> 00:07:46.770
 you trust the same thing and divide 

00:07:43.710 --> 00:07:49.410
 makes the division here of the internal part of the 

00:07:46.770 --> 00:07:52.950
 The way that you found the best 

00:07:49.410 --> 00:07:56.070
 Good. So, our bag was this. 

00:07:52.950 --> 00:07:58.560
 As I showed the link of the assembly goes 

00:07:56.070 --> 00:08:00.920
 here somewhere on the screen or 

00:07:58.560 --> 00:08:03.990
 pass the link to you 

00:08:00.920 --> 00:08:06.120
 I hope everyone has enjoyed it 

00:08:03.990 --> 00:08:10.850
 Enjoy the my page on our website
