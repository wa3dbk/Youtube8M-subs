00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:55.880 
and then there's a flex cable on top of
it<00:01:55.080> so<00:01:55.200> this<00:01:55.320> one<00:01:55.500> you<00:01:55.530> actually<00:01:55.620> have

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:55.890 
it so this one you actually have

00:01:55.890 --> 00:02:00.950 
it so this one you actually have
separated<00:01:56.310> two<00:01:56.520> places<00:01:58.760> I'm<00:01:59.760> good

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:00.960 
separated two places I'm good

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:03.630 
separated two places I'm good
all<00:02:01.440> right<00:02:01.710> now

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:03.640 
all right now

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:05.370 
all right now
using<00:02:04.300> your<00:02:04.360> small<00:02:04.570> pry<00:02:04.780> tool<00:02:04.990> go<00:02:05.170> ahead<00:02:05.290> and

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:05.380 
using your small pry tool go ahead and

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:06.930 
using your small pry tool go ahead and
start<00:02:05.500> lifting<00:02:05.680> the<00:02:05.920> motherboard<00:02:06.370> off<00:02:06.610> town

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:06.940 
start lifting the motherboard off town

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:34.250 
start lifting the motherboard off town
is<00:02:07.180> loosing<00:02:07.540> it<00:02:07.630> all<00:02:07.720> the<00:02:07.840> way<00:02:07.930> around

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:34.260 

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:36.410 

there's<00:02:34.769> a<00:02:34.890> slight<00:02:35.400> bit<00:02:35.610> of<00:02:35.730> adhesive<00:02:35.849> right

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:36.420 
there's a slight bit of adhesive right

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:39.259 
there's a slight bit of adhesive right
there<00:02:36.629> for<00:02:37.500> the<00:02:37.739> ellipse<00:02:38.040> the<00:02:38.190> earpiece<00:02:38.519> that

00:02:39.259 --> 00:02:39.269 
there for the ellipse the earpiece that

00:02:39.269 --> 00:02:40.640 
there for the ellipse the earpiece that
sticks<00:02:39.569> to<00:02:39.720> the<00:02:39.810> board<00:02:39.959> so<00:02:40.200> give<00:02:40.470> you<00:02:40.530> a<00:02:40.560> little

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:40.650 
sticks to the board so give you a little

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:42.680 
sticks to the board so give you a little
bit<00:02:40.799> of<00:02:40.920> resistance<00:02:41.159> up<00:02:41.489> there<00:02:41.640> top<00:02:42.000> but<00:02:42.330> you

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:42.690 
bit of resistance up there top but you

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:43.490 
bit of resistance up there top but you
should<00:02:42.840> peel<00:02:43.049> right<00:02:43.230> off

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:43.500 
should peel right off

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:45.039 
should peel right off
now<00:02:43.709> we've<00:02:43.830> separated<00:02:44.010> out<00:02:44.370> the<00:02:44.400> motherboard

00:02:45.039 --> 00:02:45.049 
now we've separated out the motherboard

00:02:45.049 --> 00:02:49.070 
now we've separated out the motherboard
we<00:02:46.049> are<00:02:46.170> down<00:02:46.379> to<00:02:46.409> the<00:02:47.030> frame<00:02:48.030> right<00:02:48.629> here<00:02:48.870> and
