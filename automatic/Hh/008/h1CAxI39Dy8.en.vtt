destroyed one addition and if you pay
one<00:01:01.829> of<00:01:02.070> every<00:01:02.370> single<00:01:02.550> will<00:01:02.820> including<00:01:03.809> a

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
one of every single will including a

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:06.649 
one of every single will including a
will<00:01:04.049> from<00:01:04.260> muj<00:01:04.530> dart<00:01:04.909> then<00:01:05.909> you<00:01:06.119> get<00:01:06.270> flying

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659 
will from muj dart then you get flying

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:08.480 
will from muj dart then you get flying
and<00:01:07.170> swiftness<00:01:07.590> until<00:01:07.979> the<00:01:08.040> end<00:01:08.159> of<00:01:08.220> the<00:01:08.310> turn

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
and swiftness until the end of the turn

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:11.780 
and swiftness until the end of the turn
when<00:01:08.610> she<00:01:08.760> enters<00:01:09.950> the<00:01:10.950> big<00:01:11.220> thing<00:01:11.430> to<00:01:11.520> note<00:01:11.640> is

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
when she enters the big thing to note is

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:13.789 
when she enters the big thing to note is
you<00:01:12.000> don't<00:01:12.180> get<00:01:12.330> multiple<00:01:13.020> of<00:01:13.140> each<00:01:13.260> effects

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:13.799 
you don't get multiple of each effects

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:15.560 
you don't get multiple of each effects
so<00:01:14.010> like<00:01:14.130> if<00:01:14.220> you<00:01:14.280> pay<00:01:14.460> two<00:01:14.520> light<00:01:14.939> you're

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
so like if you pay two light you're

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:16.940 
so like if you pay two light you're
still<00:01:15.900> only<00:01:15.990> gonna<00:01:16.200> gain<00:01:16.439> a<00:01:16.470> thousand<00:01:16.920> Life

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
still only gonna gain a thousand Life

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:19.580 
still only gonna gain a thousand Life
that's<00:01:17.430> really<00:01:17.700> important<00:01:18.060> to<00:01:18.150> remember<00:01:18.590> it's

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
that's really important to remember it's

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:21.080 
that's really important to remember it's
really<00:01:20.220> really<00:01:20.430> cool<00:01:20.580> the<00:01:20.759> fact<00:01:20.909> that<00:01:20.970> you

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090 
really really cool the fact that you

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:22.580 
really really cool the fact that you
should<00:01:21.150> have<00:01:21.360> this<00:01:21.479> kind<00:01:21.630> of<00:01:21.720> variety<00:01:21.900> so<00:01:22.500> if

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 
should have this kind of variety so if

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:24.109 
should have this kind of variety so if
you<00:01:22.650> jacked<00:01:22.950> me<00:01:23.130> early<00:01:23.520> you<00:01:23.670> can<00:01:23.820> still<00:01:24.000> get

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:24.119 
you jacked me early you can still get

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:25.940 
you jacked me early you can still get
some<00:01:24.150> powerful<00:01:24.509> hints<00:01:24.960> or<00:01:25.439> if<00:01:25.500> you<00:01:25.560> activate

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
some powerful hints or if you activate

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:27.980 
some powerful hints or if you activate
later<00:01:26.189> you<00:01:26.430> can<00:01:26.610> get<00:01:26.820> a<00:01:26.850> lot<00:01:27.270> of<00:01:27.420> effects<00:01:27.869> all

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990 
later you can get a lot of effects all

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:30.679 
later you can get a lot of effects all
at<00:01:28.170> once<00:01:28.490> really<00:01:29.490> really<00:01:29.820> unique<00:01:29.970> idea<00:01:30.390> for<00:01:30.479> a

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:30.689 
at once really really unique idea for a

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:32.840 
at once really really unique idea for a
roller<00:01:31.020> so<00:01:31.770> let's<00:01:31.979> go<00:01:32.130> ahead<00:01:32.220> and<00:01:32.460> dig<00:01:32.579> into

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850 
roller so let's go ahead and dig into

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:38.630 
roller so let's go ahead and dig into

lot of even cards in the deck so that's

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:06.050

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:06.060 
why we only play two as opposed to like

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:07.580 
why we only play two as opposed to like
four<00:02:06.390> like<00:02:06.750> some<00:02:06.929> other<00:02:07.049> decks<00:02:07.289> would<00:02:07.409> play

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:55.890 
get the whole idea of the deck is to

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:57.470 
get the whole idea of the deck is to
kind<00:02:56.069> of<00:02:56.160> course<00:02:56.459> your<00:02:56.609> opponent<00:02:57.030> to<00:02:57.150> never

00:02:57.470 --> 00:02:57.480 
kind of course your opponent to never

00:02:59.330 --> 00:02:59.340 
really know what's coming next for them

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:01.580 
really know what's coming next for them
and<00:03:00.299> so<00:03:00.510> a<00:03:00.540> place<00:03:00.870> he<00:03:01.019> has<00:03:01.109> a<00:03:01.170> demon<00:03:01.380> of<00:03:01.470> fate

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:01.590 
and so a place he has a demon of fate

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:03.110 
and so a place he has a demon of fate
helps<00:03:01.859> to<00:03:01.950> do<00:03:02.100> that<00:03:02.280> because<00:03:02.519> you<00:03:02.790> get<00:03:02.940> to

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:03.120 
helps to do that because you get to

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:04.400 
helps to do that because you get to
reveal<00:03:03.450> the<00:03:03.569> top<00:03:03.690> card<00:03:03.930> of<00:03:03.989> your<00:03:04.049> opponent's

of your own deck at any point in time so

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:19.550 
of your own deck at any point in time so
it<00:03:17.519> gives<00:03:17.670> a<00:03:17.760> lot<00:03:17.880> of<00:03:17.940> information<00:03:18.209> to<00:03:18.540> you<00:03:18.720> and

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:19.560 
it gives a lot of information to you and

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:21.080 
it gives a lot of information to you and
puts<00:03:19.980> your<00:03:20.040> opponent<00:03:20.430> in<00:03:20.489> this<00:03:20.579> kind<00:03:20.790> of<00:03:20.849> state

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:21.090 
puts your opponent in this kind of state

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:22.970 
puts your opponent in this kind of state
of<00:03:21.269> like<00:03:21.420> I<00:03:21.569> don't<00:03:21.630> really<00:03:21.900> know<00:03:22.049> exactly<00:03:22.410> what

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:22.980 
of like I don't really know exactly what

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:24.410 
of like I don't really know exactly what
I'm<00:03:23.069> gonna<00:03:23.190> be<00:03:23.280> dealing<00:03:23.579> with<00:03:23.730> or<00:03:24.060> what<00:03:24.329> I'm

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:24.420 
I'm gonna be dealing with or what I'm

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:26.360 
I'm gonna be dealing with or what I'm
gonna<00:03:24.540> draw<00:03:24.720> into<00:03:24.989> next<00:03:25.260> which<00:03:25.950> is<00:03:25.980> really

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:26.370 
gonna draw into next which is really

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:27.740 
gonna draw into next which is really
powerful<00:03:26.519> when<00:03:26.880> you<00:03:27.000> get<00:03:27.150> them<00:03:27.269> into<00:03:27.389> a<00:03:27.480> state

keeping the Mach off pace off guard and

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:59.119 
keeping the Mach off pace off guard and
zero<00:03:55.709> really<00:03:55.920> helps<00:03:56.189> to<00:03:56.310> do<00:03:56.430> that<00:03:57.769> and<00:03:58.769> then<00:03:59.040> of

think<00:05:18.409> there's<00:05:19.409> a<00:05:19.470> lot<00:05:19.590> of<00:05:19.620> control<00:05:19.979> decks<00:05:20.190> out

00:05:20.330 --> 00:05:20.340 
think there's a lot of control decks out

00:05:20.340 --> 00:05:23.030 
think there's a lot of control decks out
there<00:05:20.580> and<00:05:20.880> so<00:05:21.060> the<00:05:21.599> ability<00:05:21.810> to

00:05:23.030 --> 00:05:23.040 
there and so the ability to

00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:25.490 
there and so the ability to
just<00:05:23.580> force<00:05:23.940> them<00:05:24.030> to<00:05:24.120> go<00:05:24.360> down<00:05:24.510> 2-0<00:05:24.660> cards<00:05:25.230> can

00:05:25.490 --> 00:05:25.500 
just force them to go down 2-0 cards can

00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:27.050 
just force them to go down 2-0 cards can
be<00:05:25.530> really<00:05:25.890> really<00:05:26.100> effective<00:05:26.520> especially

00:05:27.050 --> 00:05:27.060 
be really really effective especially

00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:28.280 
be really really effective especially
when<00:05:27.390> they're<00:05:27.510> spending<00:05:27.870> all<00:05:28.110> their<00:05:28.230> time

00:05:28.280 --> 00:05:28.290 
when they're spending all their time

00:05:28.290 --> 00:05:31.820 
when they're spending all their time
worrying<00:05:28.680> about<00:05:28.860> trying<00:05:29.700> to<00:05:30.030> get<00:05:30.500> like<00:05:31.500> elvish

00:05:31.820 --> 00:05:31.830 
worrying about trying to get like elvish

00:05:31.830 --> 00:05:33.260 
worrying about trying to get like elvish
briefs<00:05:32.040> and<00:05:32.220> stuff<00:05:32.400> on<00:05:32.550> board<00:05:32.730> to<00:05:32.940> ramp<00:05:33.120> up

00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:33.270 
briefs and stuff on board to ramp up

00:05:33.270 --> 00:05:35.000 
briefs and stuff on board to ramp up
their<00:05:33.360> mana<00:05:33.570> you<00:05:33.870> can<00:05:34.290> just<00:05:34.440> say<00:05:34.590> oh<00:05:34.620> cool

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:35.010 
their mana you can just say oh cool

00:05:35.010 --> 00:05:36.500 
their mana you can just say oh cool
since<00:05:35.280> you're<00:05:35.370> not<00:05:35.460> drawing<00:05:35.700> cards<00:05:36.030> my<00:05:36.210> little

00:05:36.500 --> 00:05:36.510 
since you're not drawing cards my little

00:05:36.510 --> 00:05:38.660 
since you're not drawing cards my little
spare<00:05:36.720> and<00:05:36.960> just<00:05:37.590> put<00:05:37.980> them<00:05:38.070> into<00:05:38.220> a<00:05:38.280> top<00:05:38.490> deck

00:05:38.660 --> 00:05:38.670 
spare and just put them into a top deck

00:05:38.670 --> 00:05:39.800 
spare and just put them into a top deck
mode<00:05:38.850> we're<00:05:39.030> having<00:05:39.300> all<00:05:39.390> that<00:05:39.540> man<00:05:39.690> it

00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:39.810

mode we're having all that man it
doesn't<00:05:39.930> really<00:05:40.140> help<00:05:40.290> them<00:05:41.120> and<00:05:42.120> then<00:05:42.300> for

00:05:42.620 --> 00:05:42.630 
doesn't really help them and then for

00:05:42.630 --> 00:05:45.880 
doesn't really help them and then for
our<00:05:42.660> removal<00:05:43.170> we<00:05:43.320> run<00:05:43.500> to<00:05:43.860> starting<00:05:44.220> to<00:05:44.310> death

00:05:45.880 --> 00:05:45.890 
our removal we run to starting to death

00:05:45.890 --> 00:05:48.230 
our removal we run to starting to death
for<00:05:46.890> flames<00:05:47.430> of<00:05:47.610> outer<00:05:47.730> world

00:05:48.230 --> 00:05:48.240 
for flames of outer world

00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:49.310 
for flames of outer world
I<00:05:48.270> think<00:05:48.510> claims<00:05:48.720> about<00:05:48.840> a<00:05:48.960> world<00:05:49.170> right<00:05:49.290> now

00:05:49.310 --> 00:05:49.320 
I think claims about a world right now

00:05:49.320 --> 00:05:52.160 
I think claims about a world right now
is<00:05:49.530> just<00:05:49.710> a<00:05:49.800> better<00:05:50.100> card<00:05:50.780> than<00:05:51.780> stoning<00:05:52.140> to

00:05:52.160 --> 00:05:52.170 
is just a better card than stoning to

00:05:52.170 --> 00:05:53.810 
is just a better card than stoning to
death<00:05:52.260> but<00:05:52.590> I<00:05:52.620> still<00:05:52.860> like<00:05:53.070> having<00:05:53.250> stoning

00:05:53.810 --> 00:05:53.820 
death but I still like having stoning

00:05:53.820 --> 00:05:55.730 
death but I still like having stoning
because<00:05:54.390> planes<00:05:54.780> can't<00:05:55.080> kill<00:05:55.290> stuff<00:05:55.500> likes

00:05:55.730 --> 00:05:55.740 
because planes can't kill stuff likes

00:05:55.740 --> 00:06:00.590 
because planes can't kill stuff likes
blazer<00:05:56.160> or<00:05:56.610> Mustafa<00:05:57.450> lease<00:05:59.060> so<00:06:00.060> flames<00:06:00.480> of

00:06:00.590 --> 00:06:00.600 
blazer or Mustafa lease so flames of

00:06:00.600 --> 00:06:02.180 
blazer or Mustafa lease so flames of
outer<00:06:00.750> world<00:06:00.960> really<00:06:01.620> really<00:06:01.830> good<00:06:01.950> card

00:06:02.180 --> 00:06:02.190 
outer world really really good card

00:06:02.190 --> 00:06:03.230 
outer world really really good card
right<00:06:02.340> now<00:06:02.370> just<00:06:02.610> because<00:06:02.790> it's<00:06:02.940> untraceable

00:06:03.230 --> 00:06:03.240 
right now just because it's untraceable

00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:05.990 
right now just because it's untraceable
it<00:06:03.540> kills<00:06:03.690> a<00:06:03.780> lot<00:06:03.810> of<00:06:03.960> stuff<00:06:04.670> not<00:06:05.670> very<00:06:05.850> much<00:06:05.970> of

00:06:05.990 --> 00:06:06.000 
it kills a lot of stuff not very much of

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:09.050 
it kills a lot of stuff not very much of
stuff<00:06:06.330> is<00:06:06.660> is<00:06:07.110> more<00:06:07.860> than<00:06:08.070> 800<00:06:08.580> except<00:06:08.880> for

00:06:09.050 --> 00:06:09.060 
stuff is is more than 800 except for

00:06:09.060 --> 00:06:11.420 
stuff is is more than 800 except for
things<00:06:09.150> like<00:06:09.270> blazer<00:06:09.570> so<00:06:10.190> flames<00:06:11.190> about<00:06:11.400> a

00:06:11.420 --> 00:06:11.430 
things like blazer so flames about a

00:06:11.430 --> 00:06:12.470 
things like blazer so flames about a
world<00:06:11.610> I<00:06:11.730> think<00:06:11.910> is<00:06:12.030> really<00:06:12.180> good<00:06:12.360> especially

00:06:12.470 --> 00:06:12.480 
world I think is really good especially

00:06:12.480 --> 00:06:13.910 
world I think is really good especially
than<00:06:12.810> the<00:06:12.870> fact<00:06:13.020> that<00:06:13.050> it<00:06:13.200> can't<00:06:13.440> be<00:06:13.500> countered

00:06:13.910 --> 00:06:13.920 
than the fact that it can't be countered

00:06:13.920 --> 00:06:16.460 
than the fact that it can't be countered
so<00:06:14.390> really<00:06:15.390> really<00:06:15.510> good<00:06:15.600> and<00:06:15.990> then<00:06:16.140> stomach

00:06:16.460 --> 00:06:16.470 
so really really good and then stomach

00:06:16.470 --> 00:06:17.690 
so really really good and then stomach
to<00:06:16.530> death<00:06:16.680> is<00:06:16.830> just<00:06:16.980> for<00:06:17.100> those<00:06:17.220> things<00:06:17.430> that

00:06:17.690 --> 00:06:17.700 
to death is just for those things that

00:06:17.700 --> 00:06:21.440 
to death is just for those things that
flames<00:06:18.300> can't<00:06:18.630> deal<00:06:18.780> with<00:06:18.990> and<00:06:19.260> then<00:06:20.160> tree<00:06:21.090> to

00:06:21.440 --> 00:06:21.450 
flames can't deal with and then tree to

00:06:21.450 --> 00:06:24.380 
flames can't deal with and then tree to
