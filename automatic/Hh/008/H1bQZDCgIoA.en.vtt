00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:12.140 
tomahawk and then it's just going to

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:14.260 
tomahawk and then it's just going to

00:01:18.279 --> 00:01:18.289 
to pick up the upgraded version so i

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:20.499 
to pick up the upgraded version so i
would<00:01:18.800> suggest<00:01:19.220> you<00:01:19.520> have<00:01:19.700> one<00:01:19.880> zombie<00:01:20.270> left

00:01:20.499 --> 00:01:20.509

you<00:01:20.929> toss<00:01:21.860> it<00:01:22.100> down<00:01:22.130> you<00:01:22.520> go<00:01:22.640> through<00:01:22.819> around

00:01:23.139 --> 00:01:23.149 
you toss it down you go through around

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:24.730 
you toss it down you go through around
and<00:01:23.390> then<00:01:23.479> once<00:01:23.750> you<00:01:23.869> do<00:01:23.990> that<00:01:24.020> you<00:01:24.259> go<00:01:24.410> back<00:01:24.440> to

00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:24.740 
and then once you do that you go back to

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:26.790 
and then once you do that you go back to
where<00:01:25.130> you<00:01:25.250> first<00:01:25.459> get<00:01:25.729> your<00:01:25.759> tomahawk<00:01:26.240> and
