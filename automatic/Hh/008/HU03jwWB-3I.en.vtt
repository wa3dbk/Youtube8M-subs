00:00:06.630 --> 00:00:09.230
 ah 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:13.650
 very good to all the boys and girls 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:15.570
 welcome to a new video word of 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:17.640
 warcraft I am face gamer and today I am going to 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:19.710
 teach a video a little different from what 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:21.570
 I do not usually come with a guide of 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:24.539
 bands or with a dungeon guide 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:26.880
 neither with any battlefield in 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:29.429
 pvp or anything like that today I'm going to 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:32.099
 have a video to show you and what 

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:33.600
 you think you see how about everything 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:35.370
 for people who do not have my standards 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:39.020
 already or simply do not play the 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:42.020
 official and still has not heard 

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:43.910
 of this mount you see that dragon that you see 

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:45.980
 there good because that's a saddle 

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:47.600
 God takes it all now so that this 

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:50.150
 video like I bring it a little late 

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:53.090
 because you're already going through a storm and it 's 

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:54.950
 peta and ximo of dragons nimbus by 

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:57.290
 any city or any area is 

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:58.610
 that is the same dragon dragons how 

00:00:57.290 --> 00:01:01.040
 you get this dragon 

00:00:58.610 --> 00:01:03.470
 well then when you complete almost all or 

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:06.590
 all the missions of the jade forest 

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:09.200
 worth the continent of Pandaria one 

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:11.900
 region that fills with trees and such 

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:14.690
 in the arboretum that is an area they give you 

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:17.030
 daily missions of the organization or 

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:19.759
 rather the order of the dragon nimbus 

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:22.580
 is worth the order of the dragon limbo it is 

00:01:19.759 --> 00:01:24.860
 an order of riders that is dedicated to 

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:26.840
 ride this kind of exclusive dragons 

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:29.600
 of the continent of panda area and when 

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:31.640
 complete all the missions one and the other 

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:33.770
 time and you get to the reputation of exalted 

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:36.710
 as always because it gives you in this saddle 

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:38.390
 eye they give you because you can buy it 

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:42.290
 You can also buy in the blue color 

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:44.180
 the golden color and the green color are worth 

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:45.920
 mine in this case is green as 

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:47.690
 you have seen there that they were celebrating 

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:49.670
 it will be like a celebration party 

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:51.740
 because it has already made me a rider 

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:54.530
 the order and good what I wanted to tell you 

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:56.600
 is that they give it to you because at the beginning of 

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:58.400
 the daily missions give you an egg that 

00:01:56.600 --> 00:02:01.190
 hatch shortly after starting the 

00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:03.200
 missions and from there you have to go 

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:05.540
 completing daily missions one day after 

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:07.160
 another one day after another and good as 

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:08.640
 that it took me to complete the missions 

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:10.800
 daily 

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:13.740
 if you meet every day then at the end 

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:16.860
 your dragon becomes big when 

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:19.740
 you reach 100% reputation 

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:22.050
 exalted your dragon 'supposedly 

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:25.260
 become an adult dragon and it gives you 

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:27.090
 the mount or they give you the dragon that's 

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:29.130
 a good thing because of course it's a 

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:31.440
 reward for having come to exalted 

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:33.450
 with the nimbus entry order also 

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:35.820
 there are other red dragons but 

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:38.430
 This is achieved by killing a bug 

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:40.470
 quite narrow a weird and it's pretty 

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:42.690
 difficult to access him you can not kill him 

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:45.330
 as well as if you find it too 

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:47.610
 the dragon says it is black 

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:50.550
 you kill the sat of the anger of the video 

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:51.810
 earlier that I will upload wow and can can 

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:54.060
 happen to be touching you 

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:55.709
 dragon or nif and also if you get to the 

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:59.070
 reputation of exalted with the bushes 

00:02:55.709 --> 00:03:02.280
 is heavenly yes yes to tastes 

00:02:59.070 --> 00:03:04.500
 heavenly, they give you a nimbus dragon 

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:06.930
 but that has little lines around his 

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:08.310
 body well so very rare and good that already 

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:10.320
 you have seen it because I pretend 

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:12.239
 support me all the nimbus dragons that 

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:14.370
 There is because, because on a whim and 

00:03:12.239 --> 00:03:15.060
 good point people comment the video 

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:17.280
 you know 

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:19.080
 something different today is not bad about this 

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:21.800
 saddle I like a lot and up 

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:21.800
 the next chao
