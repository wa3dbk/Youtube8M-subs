00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:21.750 
to my heart and that is time off people

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:23.630 
to my heart and that is time off people
ask<00:00:21.990> me<00:00:22.170> how<00:00:22.350> can<00:00:22.529> our<00:00:22.619> clients<00:00:23.130> take<00:00:23.310> so<00:00:23.490> much

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:23.640 
ask me how can our clients take so much

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:24.620 
ask me how can our clients take so much
time<00:00:23.910> off<00:00:24.150> because<00:00:24.269> this<00:00:24.449> is<00:00:24.570> a

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:24.630 
time off because this is a

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:26.089 
time off because this is a
characteristic<00:00:25.019> that<00:00:25.289> I've<00:00:25.529> studied<00:00:25.740> for<00:00:26.039> the

00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:26.099 
characteristic that I've studied for the

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:28.790 
characteristic that I've studied for the
last<00:00:26.310> almost<00:00:27.029> thirty<00:00:27.420> years<00:00:27.539> now<00:00:28.050> and<00:00:28.289> the

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:28.800 
last almost thirty years now and the

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:30.830 
last almost thirty years now and the
clients<00:00:29.369> that<00:00:29.550> we<00:00:29.640> work<00:00:29.670> with<00:00:30.210> that<00:00:30.449> take<00:00:30.689> the

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:30.840 
clients that we work with that take the

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:33.350 
clients that we work with that take the
most<00:00:30.869> time<00:00:31.230> off<00:00:31.710> and<00:00:32.099> the<00:00:32.250> taking<00:00:32.790> time<00:00:33.000> off<00:00:33.180> at

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:33.360 
most time off and the taking time off at

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:35.270 
most time off and the taking time off at
regular<00:00:33.750> intervals<00:00:34.170> always<00:00:34.860> seem<00:00:35.070> to<00:00:35.100> out

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:35.280 
regular intervals always seem to out

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:36.740 
regular intervals always seem to out
produce<00:00:35.730> those<00:00:35.969> that<00:00:36.180> seem<00:00:36.360> to<00:00:36.480> have<00:00:36.600> their

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750 
produce those that seem to have their

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:38.569 
produce those that seem to have their
nose<00:00:36.960> down<00:00:37.200> to<00:00:37.260> the<00:00:37.469> grindstone<00:00:37.829> every<00:00:38.399> day

00:00:38.569 --> 00:00:38.579 
nose down to the grindstone every day

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:40.910 
nose down to the grindstone every day
and<00:00:38.850> are<00:00:39.480> down<00:00:39.960> in<00:00:40.140> the<00:00:40.200> mouth<00:00:40.350> all<00:00:40.620> the<00:00:40.770> time

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920 
and are down in the mouth all the time

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:43.549 
and are down in the mouth all the time
as<00:00:41.100> we<00:00:41.250> say<00:00:41.600> the<00:00:42.600> interesting<00:00:43.079> thing<00:00:43.320> is<00:00:43.530> that

00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:43.559 
as we say the interesting thing is that

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:46.310 
as we say the interesting thing is that
we<00:00:43.770> go<00:00:43.950> through<00:00:44.160> these<00:00:44.309> stages<00:00:44.730> in<00:00:45.270> our<00:00:45.480> work

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
we go through these stages in our work

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:48.709 
we go through these stages in our work
life<00:00:47.010> that<00:00:47.579> we<00:00:47.700> we<00:00:48.120> go<00:00:48.270> through<00:00:48.539> and<00:00:48.660> we

00:00:48.709 --> 00:00:48.719 
life that we we go through and we

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:50.389 
life that we we go through and we
probably<00:00:48.930> recognize<00:00:49.530> these<00:00:49.770> but<00:00:50.010> usually

00:00:50.389 --> 00:00:50.399 
probably recognize these but usually

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:52.670 
probably recognize these but usually
it's<00:00:50.520> too<00:00:50.730> late<00:00:50.969> when<00:00:51.210> we<00:00:51.239> recognize<00:00:51.660> them<00:00:52.110> but

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
it's too late when we recognize them but

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:55.430 
it's too late when we recognize them but
we<00:00:52.890> go<00:00:53.039> on<00:00:53.129> a<00:00:53.219> vacation<00:00:53.809> we<00:00:54.809> actually<00:00:55.199> come

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
we go on a vacation we actually come

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:58.310 
we go on a vacation we actually come
back<00:00:55.680> fresh<00:00:56.309> we've<00:00:56.760> been<00:00:57.180> rested<00:00:57.989> and<00:00:58.140> ready

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
back fresh we've been rested and ready

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:01.099 
back fresh we've been rested and ready
to<00:00:58.469> go<00:00:58.770> we're<00:00:59.399> full<00:00:59.789> of<00:00:59.910> energy<00:01:00.420> and<00:01:00.930> I<00:01:01.079> think

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
to go we're full of energy and I think

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:03.529 
to go we're full of energy and I think
that<00:01:01.469> that<00:01:01.530> energy<00:01:02.070> level<00:01:02.579> is<00:01:02.760> what<00:01:03.149> makes<00:01:03.390> a

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539 
that that energy level is what makes a

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:05.479 
that that energy level is what makes a
huge<00:01:03.840> difference<00:01:04.260> in<00:01:04.379> a<00:01:04.470> dental<00:01:04.949> practice<00:01:05.339> or

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
huge difference in a dental practice or

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:07.250 
huge difference in a dental practice or
anything<00:01:05.700> for<00:01:06.030> that<00:01:06.150> matter<00:01:06.390> in<00:01:06.570> life<00:01:06.600> and

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260 
anything for that matter in life and

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:09.440 
anything for that matter in life and
it's<00:01:07.979> not<00:01:08.189> a<00:01:08.220> huge<00:01:08.700> difference<00:01:08.880> it's<00:01:09.299> that

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450 
it's not a huge difference it's that

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:11.570 
it's not a huge difference it's that
it's<00:01:09.990> it's<00:01:10.320> not<00:01:10.439> this<00:01:10.650> huge<00:01:10.890> difference<00:01:11.400> it's

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
it's it's not this huge difference it's

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:12.859 
it's it's not this huge difference it's
this<00:01:11.700> little<00:01:11.939> difference<00:01:12.420> it<00:01:12.570> makes<00:01:12.720> the

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
this little difference it makes the

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:14.660 
this little difference it makes the
difference<00:01:12.990> so<00:01:13.979> we<00:01:14.100> come<00:01:14.310> back<00:01:14.340> from<00:01:14.549> a

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
difference so we come back from a

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:16.609 
difference so we come back from a
vacation<00:01:14.700> if<00:01:15.360> you<00:01:15.450> can<00:01:15.600> visualize<00:01:15.780> this<00:01:16.259> we<00:01:16.439> go

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
vacation if you can visualize this we go

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:19.550 
vacation if you can visualize this we go
through<00:01:16.950> a<00:01:17.100> productive<00:01:18.090> phase<00:01:18.390> for<00:01:18.750> several

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
through a productive phase for several

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:22.100 
through a productive phase for several
weeks<00:01:19.830> now<00:01:20.220> I've<00:01:20.850> found<00:01:21.119> that<00:01:21.390> number<00:01:21.930> to<00:01:22.080> be

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
weeks now I've found that number to be

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:23.899 
weeks now I've found that number to be
varying<00:01:22.650> between<00:01:22.770> doc<00:01:23.130> different<00:01:23.520> doctors

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909 
varying between doc different doctors

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:26.390 
varying between doc different doctors
but<00:01:24.090> somewhere<00:01:24.689> between<00:01:24.930> four<00:01:25.920> and<00:01:25.950> eight

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 
but somewhere between four and eight

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:28.999 
but somewhere between four and eight
weeks<00:01:26.670> out<00:01:26.939> here<00:01:27.210> most<00:01:27.810> doctors<00:01:28.140> hit<00:01:28.590> what<00:01:28.829> we

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:29.009 
weeks out here most doctors hit what we

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:31.429 
weeks out here most doctors hit what we
call<00:01:29.310> the<00:01:29.700> mechanical<00:01:30.570> stage<00:01:30.900> now<00:01:31.409> the

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:31.439 
call the mechanical stage now the

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:33.350 
call the mechanical stage now the
mechanical<00:01:32.130> stages<00:01:32.579> you're<00:01:32.790> still<00:01:33.119> showing

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360 
mechanical stages you're still showing

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:35.060 
mechanical stages you're still showing
up<00:01:33.570> for<00:01:33.750> work<00:01:33.810> you're<00:01:34.200> coming<00:01:34.530> in<00:01:34.650> on<00:01:34.740> time

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070 
up for work you're coming in on time

up for work you're coming in on time
you're<00:01:35.759> going<00:01:36.030> through<00:01:36.329> the<00:01:36.450> motions<00:01:36.900> but<00:01:37.110> the

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:37.680 
you're going through the motions but the

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:40.130 
you're going through the motions but the
juices<00:01:38.159> just<00:01:38.189> aren't<00:01:38.790> flowing<00:01:39.299> this<00:01:39.720> is<00:01:39.930> where

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140 
juices just aren't flowing this is where

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:41.600 
juices just aren't flowing this is where
you're<00:01:40.320> starting<00:01:40.560> to<00:01:40.799> think<00:01:40.829> to<00:01:41.159> yourself

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
you're starting to think to yourself

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:43.460 
you're starting to think to yourself
this<00:01:41.790> is<00:01:41.850> getting<00:01:42.270> old<00:01:42.509> I'm<00:01:42.810> getting<00:01:43.049> tired<00:01:43.259> of

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:43.470 
this is getting old I'm getting tired of

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:45.020 
this is getting old I'm getting tired of
this<00:01:43.680> I<00:01:43.920> need<00:01:44.399> a<00:01:44.430> break

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.030 
this I need a break

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:47.179 
this I need a break
well<00:01:45.240> then<00:01:45.899> if<00:01:46.079> you<00:01:46.170> don't<00:01:46.380> take<00:01:46.560> a<00:01:46.590> break<00:01:46.799> here

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:47.189 
well then if you don't take a break here

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:49.370 
well then if you don't take a break here
what<00:01:47.460> happens<00:01:47.820> is<00:01:47.970> you<00:01:48.090> go<00:01:48.270> into<00:01:48.540> what<00:01:48.960> we<00:01:49.079> call
