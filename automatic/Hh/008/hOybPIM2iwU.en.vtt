00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:27.779 
including this really fast and very

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:30.080

the<00:00:30.960> actual<00:00:31.230> mechanics<00:00:31.650> haven't<00:00:31.920> changed<00:00:32.279> but

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:32.790 
the actual mechanics haven't changed but

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:34.220 
the actual mechanics haven't changed but
actually<00:00:32.910> I<00:00:33.149> think<00:00:33.360> this<00:00:33.420> is<00:00:33.480> a<00:00:33.600> good<00:00:33.809> thing<00:00:33.870> as

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:34.230 
actually I think this is a good thing as

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:35.690 
actually I think this is a good thing as
a<00:00:34.260> soil<00:00:34.469> mechanics<00:00:34.680> with<00:00:35.010> lightsabers<00:00:35.520> mix

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:35.700 
a soil mechanics with lightsabers mix

action although without force powers the

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:42.530 
action although without force powers the
duel<00:00:40.770> of<00:00:40.920> fates<00:00:41.129> is<00:00:41.370> very<00:00:41.640> difficult<00:00:41.969> to<00:00:42.329> stay

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:42.540

00:02:59.429 --> 00:02:59.439 
grenades are hilariously fun on this map

00:02:59.439 --> 00:03:01.589 
grenades are hilariously fun on this map
because<00:02:59.799> you<00:02:59.890> send<00:03:00.129> people<00:03:00.250> flying<00:03:00.519> and<00:03:00.970> you

00:03:01.589 --> 00:03:01.599 
because you send people flying and you

00:03:01.599 --> 00:03:03.839 
because you send people flying and you
get<00:03:01.780> sent<00:03:01.959> flying<00:03:02.260> it<00:03:02.590> is<00:03:03.040> just<00:03:03.310> so<00:03:03.670> ridiculous

00:03:03.839 --> 00:03:03.849 
get sent flying it is just so ridiculous

00:03:03.849 --> 00:03:07.050 
get sent flying it is just so ridiculous
I<00:03:04.569> love<00:03:05.230> this<00:03:05.349> quick<00:03:05.680> although<00:03:06.549> the<00:03:06.670> crossbow

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:07.060 
I love this quick although the crossbow

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:09.059 
I love this quick although the crossbow
to<00:03:07.120> laser<00:03:07.390> conversion<00:03:08.079> is<00:03:08.230> pretty<00:03:08.620> lame<00:03:08.890> at

00:03:09.059 --> 00:03:09.069 
to laser conversion is pretty lame at

00:03:09.069 --> 00:03:12.030 
to laser conversion is pretty lame at
the<00:03:09.189> moment<00:03:09.519> anyway<00:03:10.510> i<00:03:11.349> hope<00:03:11.409> this<00:03:11.590> isn't<00:03:11.980> the

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:12.040 
the moment anyway i hope this isn't the

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:13.470 
the moment anyway i hope this isn't the
end<00:03:12.189> for<00:03:12.250> the<00:03:12.400> Star<00:03:12.640> Wars<00:03:12.760> much<00:03:12.970> as<00:03:13.120> it<00:03:13.239> shows<00:03:13.450> a

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:13.480 
end for the Star Wars much as it shows a

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:15.479 
end for the Star Wars much as it shows a
lot<00:03:13.569> of<00:03:13.750> promise<00:03:14.230> and<00:03:14.409> there's<00:03:14.590> already<00:03:14.829> fun

00:03:15.479 --> 00:03:15.489 
lot of promise and there's already fun

00:03:15.489 --> 00:03:17.069 
lot of promise and there's already fun
to<00:03:15.640> play<00:03:15.819> and<00:03:16.060> the<00:03:16.329> maps<00:03:16.599> are<00:03:16.810> pretty

00:03:17.069 --> 00:03:17.079 
to play and the maps are pretty

00:03:17.079 --> 00:03:18.960 
to play and the maps are pretty
brilliant<00:03:17.319> although<00:03:18.129> this<00:03:18.250> the<00:03:18.459> palace<00:03:18.790> map

00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:18.970 
brilliant although this the palace map

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:20.460 
brilliant although this the palace map
doesn't<00:03:19.180> have<00:03:19.389> those<00:03:19.510> laser<00:03:19.810> beam<00:03:20.079> shutters

00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:20.470 
doesn't have those laser beam shutters

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:22.229 
doesn't have those laser beam shutters
that<00:03:20.620> qui-gon<00:03:20.859> and<00:03:21.069> dark<00:03:21.370> more<00:03:21.579> get<00:03:21.819> stuck<00:03:22.030> in

00:03:22.229 --> 00:03:22.239 
that qui-gon and dark more get stuck in

00:03:22.239 --> 00:03:26.460 
that qui-gon and dark more get stuck in
I<00:03:22.420> really<00:03:23.139> would<00:03:23.290> like<00:03:23.379> to<00:03:23.440> see<00:03:23.560> those<00:03:25.470> anyway

00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:26.470 
I really would like to see those anyway
