 contender maybe 2 scoring chances we 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:00.510
 completely controlled the middle zone 

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:02.579
 because no one could overcome her not 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:04.320
 losing speed while we 

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:06.170

 advantage of our players in a foreign zone 

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:10.560
 frankly the game in defense was 2 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:12.479
 the most dominant part of our game 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:15.390

 displeased this time goes to 

00:01:19.009 --> 00:01:23.570
 North American national team to look for 

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:25.380
 dull played and the stars did not flash

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:35.009
 created by a brilliantly big go on 

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:37.290
 the olympiad did not throw a single puck 

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:39.240

 by the way he and the whole vancouver sat in 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:42.180
 shadows likewise honored on 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:44.220
 the only goal in the final 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:46.560
 and is it a bit early proclaimed new 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:48.240
 walnut blood run as enviable 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:50.189

 pitsburg coming to the world championship 

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:53.880

 international tournament cars national team 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:59.610
 for a Canadian he just can not afford to 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:00.240
 real experts are usually in 

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:02.430
 delighted 

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:04.130
 in an interview championship com Oleg brother 

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:06.360
 admired how to look confidently 

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:08.940
 North American teams at the site 

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:11.190
 European size and this too 

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:12.260
 amazing how tactically competent and 

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:14.269
 flexibly played 

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:16.459
 Canadians ends on unusual ground 

00:02:14.269 --> 00:02:19.069
 unusual not only in size but also in 

00:02:16.459 --> 00:02:20.959
 the markup these teams during the match even 

00:02:19.069 --> 00:02:22.280
 corrected their tactics we saw and 

00:02:20.959 --> 00:02:23.900
 rollback in their performance 

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:26.030
 for example Canadians in the first period with 

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:28.519
 Team USA Americans in match with Russia 

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:31.010
 the whole game for these teams was built 

00:02:28.519 --> 00:02:33.500
 competently and positional defense and such 

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:35.329
 Canadians launched the attack showed the ideal 

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:42.799
 hockey today and on 

00:02:35.329 --> 00:02:44.900
 European site in the meantime 

00:02:42.799 --> 00:02:46.909
 khl championship fun before playoff 

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:49.099
 All that remains is nothing Soviet sport 

00:02:46.909 --> 00:02:51.230
 determines 6 intrigues of the final stage 

00:02:49.099 --> 00:02:53.420
 Regularly in the east are fighting for

 admiral and avant-garde in Omsk no chance 

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:59.989
 so much and probably this season will turn out 

00:02:57.799 --> 00:03:02.780
 a failure in the west the situation is quite 

00:02:59.989 --> 00:03:05.000
 similar to the same abyss risk 

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:07.010
 crash locomotive a year ago Yaroslavl 

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:08.629
 for the first time did not break through the eight and now 

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:10.730
 may altogether instead of the Gagarin Cup 

00:03:08.629 --> 00:03:12.980
 proceed to the draw of the cup of hope 

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:14.900
 save the situation caused from canada 

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:16.760
 Mentor veteran Dave King

 another corner of the ring coach debutant 

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:21.019
 Alexey Kudashov how sorry that his atlas 

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:23.329
 so many reasons in this regular season 

00:03:21.019 --> 00:03:25.160
 meet here it would be hack but all 

00:03:23.329 --> 00:03:27.440
 equal ending is expected to be rare 

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:29.840
 fascinating locomotive and atlas will 

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:32.090
 same rivals motorist 

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:34.819
 game boris and attention the most important thing 

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:37.280
 avant-garde rye is quite possible and on 

00:03:34.819 --> 00:03:40.280
 Czech choleric and decide who Yaroslavl 

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:42.049
 whether mother are looking to play playoff connection with 

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:44.629
 Ukrainian events national newspaper 

00:03:42.049 --> 00:03:46.400
 worry about the fate of the Donbass for example 

00:03:44.629 --> 00:03:47.840
 recently to neutral territory was 

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:50.389
 brought a football match with 

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:52.069
 Kiev Dynamo and you have a similar fate 

00:03:50.389 --> 00:03:54.169
 hockey team from Donetsk 

00:03:52.069 --> 00:03:56.419
 Sergey Begishev phoned to the President 

00:03:54.169 --> 00:03:59.599
 Donbas Boris Kolesnikova is tuned 

00:03:56.419 --> 00:04:00.739
 optimistically Donetsk is still not cues to 

00:03:59.599 --> 00:04:02.389
 besides there is a football stadium 

00:04:00.739 --> 00:04:04.370
 olympic is only one and a half 

00:04:02.389 --> 00:04:05.780
 kilometers from Independence Square and 

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:07.879
 of course it was extremely undesirable 

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:09.680
 hold a football match on it to 

00:04:07.879 --> 00:04:12.590
 did he fall on the day of national mourning 

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:14.569
 in general there were objective reasons for 

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:16.699
 Donetsk football will be on this 

00:04:14.569 --> 00:04:19.010
 a week miner will play a league match europe and 

00:04:16.699 --> 00:04:22.389
 Of course the city is preparing for that of hell 

00:04:19.010 --> 00:04:22.389
 where did we go for the first time 

00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:29.840
 match against Slovakia Ilya 

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:31.520
 Kovalchuk earned damage to the meniscus 

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:33.230
 despite the pain of the captain of St. Petersburg 

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:34.460
 CSKA held and following games against 

00:04:33.230 --> 00:04:36.260
 Norway and Finland 

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:38.230
 the heroic deed of Kovalchuk 

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:40.880
 admires Soviet sport 

00:04:38.230 --> 00:04:42.770
 Kovalchuk could not understand that in this 

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:45.050
 the moment for Russia perhaps puts on 

00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:46.820
 con general all career in particular that 

00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:48.110
 the scofield season and now is great 

00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:49.190
 the likelihood that he will miss the first 

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:51.680
 playoff round 

00:04:49.190 --> 00:04:53.390
 and in it ska can face cisco and 

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:55.850
 not the fact that in this error will win 

00:04:53.390 --> 00:04:57.710
 Petersburg club pistol how to respond 

00:04:55.850 --> 00:05:00.260
 northern capital and sliska will finish the season 

00:04:57.710 --> 00:05:02.300
 so early is it possible in such a situation 

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:04.550
 throw a stone and pour it broken 

00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:07.070
 broken for the sake of russia making this 

00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:08.510
 the moment all that could not his fault sooner 

00:05:07.070 --> 00:05:11.180
 the trouble of our entire hockey industry 

00:05:08.510 --> 00:05:13.940
 what is it all at the moment just 

00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:15.430
 fifth place on the games president 

00:05:13.940 --> 00:05:17.930
 Moscow Dynamo Arkady Rotenberg 

00:05:15.430 --> 00:05:19.370
 told the sports express about how to 

00:05:17.930 --> 00:05:21.260
 club refers to the possible value 

00:05:19.370 --> 00:05:24.200
 Oleg Snorka for the post of head coach 

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:26.300
 Russian team I think Znarok with his 

00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:28.670
 teams of specialists ripe for work 

00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:30.920
 with the national team the local moment the coach 

00:05:28.670 --> 00:05:32.780
 day should not fall out of tone otherwise 

00:05:30.920 --> 00:05:35.120
 he instantly loses form therefore 

00:05:32.780 --> 00:05:37.070
 combination of posts in the national club 

00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:40.010
 team most professional option 

00:05:37.070 --> 00:05:41.720
 and in my opinion optimal in opinion 

00:05:40.010 --> 00:05:42.860
 rotenberg contract must be valid until 

00:05:41.720 --> 00:05:45.140
 next olympiad 

00:05:42.860 --> 00:05:46.850
 there is no need to invent anything in the 

00:05:45.140 --> 00:05:49.130
 four years though mean for example 

00:05:46.850 --> 00:05:51.169
 coach give and two Olympic cycles 

00:05:49.130 --> 00:05:53.390
 so that one generation can shoot a 

00:05:51.169 --> 00:05:56.360
 the second got to her feet and knocked at 

00:05:53.390 --> 00:05:58.820
 door on the new coach 

00:05:56.360 --> 00:06:00.050
 expressed almost all of his blog on 

00:05:58.820 --> 00:06:01.700
 Soviet sports website 

00:06:00.050 --> 00:06:04.250
 This issue has also been touched by the flock 

00:06:01.700 --> 00:06:05.990
 and in the future we need not touchy 

00:06:04.250 --> 00:06:07.610
 coaches and players wise but 

00:06:05.990 --> 00:06:09.440
 friendly coach for whom 

00:06:07.610 --> 00:06:11.300
 whom to put and with whom is not 

00:06:09.440 --> 00:06:12.830
 quadrature with respect to 

00:06:11.300 --> 00:06:14.090
 to journalists as annoying stupid 

00:06:12.830 --> 00:06:16.640
 corporate style 

00:06:14.090 --> 00:06:18.560
 I have already said and will repeat our guys not 

00:06:16.640 --> 00:06:20.720
 can apologize if they do it 

00:06:18.560 --> 00:06:21.290
 do as a mentor through clenched teeth for 

00:06:20.720 --> 00:06:23.840
 pro forma 

00:06:21.290 --> 00:06:25.490
 and snarling you need a trainer who and this 

00:06:23.840 --> 00:06:27.560
 does humanly first 

00:06:25.490 --> 00:06:28.220
 I need a coach who did not have to 

00:06:27.560 --> 00:06:30.680
 would apologize 

00:06:28.220 --> 00:06:32.840
 explained shrug azarov and 

00:06:30.680 --> 00:06:36.850
 now the Ukrainian fighters are training the club 

00:06:32.840 --> 00:06:36.850
 and the national team so you will not buy for the first time 

00:06:39.900 --> 00:06:44.650
 our program has come to an end follow 

00:06:42.849 --> 00:06:45.279
 hockey and we will follow 

00:06:44.650 --> 00:06:47.199
 news 

00:06:45.279 --> 00:06:49.229
 it was continental reading to see you soon 

00:06:47.199 --> 00:06:49.229
 meeting
