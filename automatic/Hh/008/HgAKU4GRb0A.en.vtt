00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
these sort of epic things this guy I

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:23.899 
these sort of epic things this guy I
believe<00:01:22.500> even<00:01:22.830> if<00:01:22.950> somebody<00:01:23.490> would<00:01:23.670> have<00:01:23.790> been

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909 
believe even if somebody would have been

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:26.149 
believe even if somebody would have been
stronger<00:01:24.420> than<00:01:24.510> him<00:01:24.720> in<00:01:24.900> terms<00:01:25.170> of<00:01:25.260> power<00:01:25.470> he

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:26.159 
stronger than him in terms of power he

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:29.090 
stronger than him in terms of power he
has<00:01:26.369> that<00:01:27.030> technique<00:01:27.869> master<00:01:28.290> be<00:01:28.740> able<00:01:28.979> to

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100 
has that technique master be able to

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:30.620 
has that technique master be able to
every<00:01:29.430> part<00:01:29.640> of<00:01:29.700> his<00:01:29.820> body<00:01:29.850> to<00:01:30.180> perform<00:01:30.479> its

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
every part of his body to perform its

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:32.960 
every part of his body to perform its
own<00:01:30.780> attack<00:01:31.110> then<00:01:31.710> I<00:01:31.740> believe<00:01:32.040> in<00:01:32.189> then<00:01:32.729> he

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970 
own attack then I believe in then he

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:34.580 
own attack then I believe in then he
wouldn't<00:01:33.210> lose<00:01:33.420> because<00:01:33.659> even<00:01:34.350> if<00:01:34.470> you're

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
wouldn't lose because even if you're

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:36.170 
wouldn't lose because even if you're
stronger<00:01:35.010> than<00:01:35.040> it<00:01:35.250> was<00:01:35.280> it<00:01:35.880> would<00:01:36.090> be

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.180 
stronger than it was it would be

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:37.609 
stronger than it was it would be
impossible<00:01:36.390> to<00:01:36.750> be<00:01:36.900> stronger<00:01:37.140> than<00:01:37.290> this<00:01:37.409> guy

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:37.619 
impossible to be stronger than this guy

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:38.929 
impossible to be stronger than this guy
but<00:01:37.860> let's<00:01:38.159> just<00:01:38.250> say<00:01:38.490> that<00:01:38.520> if

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:38.939 
but let's just say that if

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:41.270 
but let's just say that if
hypothetically<00:01:39.510> i<00:01:40.049> still<00:01:40.770> don't<00:01:40.979> know<00:01:41.070> if<00:01:41.189> you

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:41.280 
hypothetically i still don't know if you

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:43.490 
hypothetically i still don't know if you
were<00:01:41.460> to<00:01:41.670> be<00:01:41.790> able<00:01:42.000> to<00:01:42.240> beat<00:01:42.509> him<00:01:42.720> because<00:01:43.110> this

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500 
were to be able to beat him because this

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:46.039 
were to be able to beat him because this
is<00:01:43.650> a<00:01:43.680> guy<00:01:43.950> that<00:01:44.159> really<00:01:44.430> from<00:01:45.360> what<00:01:45.630> it<00:01:45.780> seems

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:46.049 
is a guy that really from what it seems
