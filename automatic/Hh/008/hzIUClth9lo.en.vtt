00:00:01.130 --> 00:00:03.160
 U 

00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:12.860
 Dog Health pythons propagation is threatened by parasites called heartworm 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:12.860
 There is 

00:00:14.050 --> 00:00:20.880
 Heartworm infections begin in the process of mosquitoes called dogs coupe 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:28.789
 Heartworms 2 3 stage Yucheon 3 larvae enter through the skin of dogs 

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:41.750
 The 3-gun u-gun, about 1 mm in size , 

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:47.270
 It enters the body of the system through a wound caused by a mosquito 

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:51.440
 The skin layer causes the heartworm larva to go to the next stage , 

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:56.239
 Within three days, it will become the next larva 

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:57.379
 And over the next several weeks, the larvae move into the internal organs of the dog 

00:00:56.239 --> 00:01:03.350
 It's possible 

00:00:57.379 --> 00:01:05.089
 The next larva grows up to the upper mature adult at about 50 to 71 after infection 

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:11.720
 It's possible 

00:01:05.089 --> 00:01:14.590
 After infection , immature adults penetrate the blood vessels and enter the lungs and heart of the system. 

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:14.590
 Moves towards 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:26.030
 When the needle 121 after heartworm infection are a dull times smaller vessels namely waste 

00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:26.030
 The capillaries will arrive 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:38.990
 By the time of transplantation , immature adults will be about 2.5 to 4 cm in size 

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:43.060
 From that time onward, it has grown rapidly, moving to larger vessels and finally 

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:43.060
 P near the heart will lead to apnea 

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:51.280
 Two of the cardiovascular events remain in the blood vessels and inflammation of the blood vessels and surrounding lung tissue 

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:56.290
 It raises it. 

00:01:51.280 --> 00:02:00.540
 Inflammation has progressed to cause a morbid change in the pair vessels and eventually the resistance of the blood vessels 

00:01:56.290 --> 00:02:06.480
 Lose and cause obstructive hypertension. 

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:11.869
 As these heartworms become more and more intense , 

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:11.869
 It causes heart failure and eventually leads to death. 

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:24.920
 Heartworms also play a role in increasing the risk of thrombosis 

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:28.720
 When a dead dog dies , it blocks the small blood vessels and supplies the blood supply to the surrounding tissues . 

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:28.720
 You can completely block it 

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:40.970
 From 7 to 9 months after the infection , the sexually mature ancestor 

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:43.570
 Heart baby worms called onchocerciasis is one group of micro-pillars larvae Ria 

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:43.570
 Produce 

00:02:48.910 --> 00:03:00.060
 2 is a micro-pillar Ria is wandering along a single infected blood 

00:02:53.440 --> 00:03:00.060
 As the mosquitoes absorb heat, the blood flows into the throat 

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:10.400
 After approximately 14 days in the throat, the second stage larvae are infected with stage 2, 3 larvae 

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:10.400
 It's possible 

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:19.379
 This mosquito is now a new mediator that can move heartworms 

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:25.080
 The surrounding area threatens the lives of dogs and cats. 

00:03:19.379 --> 00:03:28.290
 Thus, prevention of heartworm is via necessarily be fatal because once infected 

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:30.950
 2 We must protect the life of the water family 

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:30.950
 Thank you
