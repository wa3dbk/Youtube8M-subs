just<00:01:06.450> crashed<00:01:06.689> Michael<00:01:07.049> now<00:01:07.170> another<00:01:07.470> cool

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
just crashed Michael now another cool

but not as big as the mega explosion
sort<00:01:46.829> of<00:01:46.890> like<00:01:47.040> pretending<00:01:47.520> to<00:01:47.640> be<00:01:47.759> a<00:01:47.790> creeper

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.240 
sort of like pretending to be a creeper

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:50.690 
sort of like pretending to be a creeper
but<00:01:48.750> you<00:01:49.170> can<00:01:49.320> actually<00:01:49.470> directionally<00:01:50.340> shoot

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700 
but you can actually directionally shoot

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:52.580 
but you can actually directionally shoot
so<00:01:51.000> I'll<00:01:51.180> let's<00:01:51.329> go<00:01:51.509> should<00:01:51.960> be<00:01:52.200> over<00:01:52.380> there

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590 
so I'll let's go should be over there

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:55.190 
so I'll let's go should be over there
and<00:01:52.890> it'll<00:01:53.159> create<00:01:53.460> actual<00:01:53.909> holes<00:01:54.329> so<00:01:54.630> that's

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200 
and it'll create actual holes so that's

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:56.719 
and it'll create actual holes so that's
quite<00:01:55.409> fun<00:01:55.680> to<00:01:55.710> muck<00:01:55.979> around<00:01:56.130> with<00:01:56.399> now<00:01:56.670> you

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:56.729 
quite fun to muck around with now you

00:01:56.729 --> 00:01:58.639 
quite fun to muck around with now you
may<00:01:56.969> be<00:01:57.000> thinking<00:01:57.119> well<00:01:57.719> this<00:01:57.990> mod<00:01:58.200> is<00:01:58.350> very

00:01:58.639 --> 00:01:58.649 
may be thinking well this mod is very

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:00.469 
may be thinking well this mod is very
overpowered<00:01:59.280> well<00:01:59.490> actually<00:01:59.729> it's<00:02:00.060> not<00:02:00.149> it's

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:00.479 
overpowered well actually it's not it's

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:02.330 
overpowered well actually it's not it's
actually<00:02:00.630> very<00:02:01.079> hard<00:02:01.350> to<00:02:01.590> craft<00:02:01.920> and<00:02:02.250> it

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:02.340 
actually very hard to craft and it

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:04.219 
actually very hard to craft and it
implements<00:02:02.700> three<00:02:03.090> different<00:02:03.420> oils<00:02:03.750> into<00:02:04.049> the

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:04.229 
implements three different oils into the

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:07.110 
implements three different oils into the
actual<00:02:04.619> game<00:02:04.740> and<00:02:05.280> we're<00:02:06.000> just<00:02:06.180> going<00:02:06.420> go<00:02:06.570> into

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:07.120 
actual game and we're just going go into

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:09.300 
actual game and we're just going go into
I<00:02:07.150> enough<00:02:08.110> items<00:02:08.320> and<00:02:08.740> I<00:02:08.860> see<00:02:09.040> what<00:02:09.190> you

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:09.310 
I enough items and I see what you

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:11.880 
I enough items and I see what you
actually<00:02:09.460> need<00:02:09.700> to<00:02:09.760> craft<00:02:10.150> so<00:02:10.690> it<00:02:11.050> starts<00:02:11.740> off

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:11.890 
actually need to craft so it starts off

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:13.500 
actually need to craft so it starts off
quite<00:02:12.160> simple<00:02:12.550> with<00:02:12.610> some<00:02:12.670> glass<00:02:13.030> and<00:02:13.330> some

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:39.160 
suit also some rockets in the way crafts

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:41.730 
suit also some rockets in the way crafts
a<00:02:39.340> rocket<00:02:39.760> either<00:02:39.970> by<00:02:40.240> using<00:02:40.420> an<00:02:40.660> armor<00:02:41.470> plate

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:41.740

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:44.020 
iron ingots and also TNT creates five

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:47.250 
iron ingots and also TNT creates five
rockets<00:02:44.650> alright<00:02:45.340> so<00:02:45.610> I'm<00:02:45.870> also<00:02:46.870> you<00:02:47.050> need<00:02:47.200> to

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:47.260 
rockets alright so I'm also you need to

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:49.740 
rockets alright so I'm also you need to
create<00:02:47.650> a<00:02:47.680> powered<00:02:48.220> suit<00:02:48.610> which<00:02:49.090> I<00:02:49.330> needed<00:02:49.690> an

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:49.750 
create a powered suit which I needed an

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:51.810 
create a powered suit which I needed an
