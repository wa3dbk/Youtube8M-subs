and yeah that's about it so there's not
a<00:02:33.550> lot<00:02:33.760> of<00:02:33.790> color<00:02:34.060> in<00:02:34.269> this<00:02:34.450> as<00:02:34.720> you<00:02:34.810> can<00:02:34.959> see<00:02:35.170> a

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:35.410 
a lot of color in this as you can see a

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:37.920 
a lot of color in this as you can see a
lot<00:02:36.400> of<00:02:36.430> it<00:02:36.700> comes<00:02:37.180> from<00:02:37.330> the<00:02:37.480> fact<00:02:37.660> that<00:02:37.690> goes

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:37.930 
lot of it comes from the fact that goes

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:40.530 
lot of it comes from the fact that goes
in<00:02:38.080> the<00:02:38.110> dark<00:02:38.380> and<00:02:38.940> yeah<00:02:39.940> that's<00:02:40.180> going<00:02:40.420> to<00:02:40.480> be

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:40.540 
in the dark and yeah that's going to be

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:42.750 
in the dark and yeah that's going to be
an<00:02:40.629> absolute<00:02:41.110> nightmare<00:02:41.319> to<00:02:41.709> try<00:02:41.890> and<00:02:42.010> film<00:02:42.280> so

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:42.760 
an absolute nightmare to try and film so

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:46.559 
an absolute nightmare to try and film so
I<00:02:44.160> guess<00:02:45.160> the<00:02:45.670> best<00:02:45.849> way<00:02:46.030> of<00:02:46.060> saying<00:02:46.330> this<00:02:46.420> is

00:02:46.559 --> 00:02:46.569 
I guess the best way of saying this is

00:02:46.569 --> 00:02:49.259 
I guess the best way of saying this is
go<00:02:46.750> to<00:02:46.810> my<00:02:46.989> website<00:02:47.200> sanitize<00:02:47.920> you<00:02:48.310> quedado<00:02:48.940> UK
