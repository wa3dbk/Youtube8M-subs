called a cannibal he's called a cannibal

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:49.729 
called a cannibal he's called a cannibal
I'm<00:00:48.780> wondering<00:00:49.079> if<00:00:49.170> that's<00:00:49.230> actually<00:00:49.440> fucking

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
I'm wondering if that's actually fucking

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:53.360 
I'm wondering if that's actually fucking
true<00:00:50.100> if<00:00:50.340> he<00:00:50.670> eats<00:00:50.820> people<00:00:51.090> I<00:00:51.649> mean<00:00:52.649> they're

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
true if he eats people I mean they're

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:58.069 
true if he eats people I mean they're
crazy<00:00:53.699> but<00:00:55.340> yeah<00:00:56.340> bartolomeo<00:00:57.270> is<00:00:57.600> getting

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079 
crazy but yeah bartolomeo is getting

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:00.560 
crazy but yeah bartolomeo is getting
built<00:00:58.379> up<00:00:58.620> right<00:00:58.920> and<00:00:59.160> then<00:00:59.730> we<00:00:59.850> have<00:01:00.059> Bellamy

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:00.570 
built up right and then we have Bellamy

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:02.119 
built up right and then we have Bellamy
returning<00:01:01.050> but<00:01:01.230> they're<00:01:01.350> in<00:01:01.440> the<00:01:01.530> same<00:01:01.710> block

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
returning but they're in the same block

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:04.399 
returning but they're in the same block
so<00:01:02.789> I'm<00:01:02.940> thinking<00:01:02.969> bartholomay<00:01:03.809> was<00:01:03.989> going<00:01:04.260> to

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:04.409 
so I'm thinking bartholomay was going to

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:06.620 
so I'm thinking bartholomay was going to
defeat<00:01:04.650> Bellamy<00:01:05.369> but<00:01:05.820> at<00:01:05.880> the<00:01:05.939> same<00:01:06.150> time<00:01:06.390> I

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:06.630 
defeat Bellamy but at the same time I

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:08.539 
defeat Bellamy but at the same time I
mean<00:01:06.810> I<00:01:06.990> don't<00:01:07.470> think<00:01:07.650> Bellamy<00:01:08.010> is<00:01:08.159> that

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549 
mean I don't think Bellamy is that

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:10.820 
mean I don't think Bellamy is that
strong<00:01:08.909> and<00:01:09.210> I<00:01:09.930> don't<00:01:10.080> think<00:01:10.260> he's<00:01:10.380> gonna<00:01:10.470> have

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:10.830 
strong and I don't think he's gonna have

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:13.010 
strong and I don't think he's gonna have
too<00:01:11.400> big<00:01:11.729> of<00:01:11.790> an<00:01:12.000> impact<00:01:12.150> on<00:01:12.510> the<00:01:12.600> story<00:01:12.840> but

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
too big of an impact on the story but

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:14.539 
too big of an impact on the story but
he's<00:01:13.110> still<00:01:13.290> having<00:01:13.560> a<00:01:13.710> bigger<00:01:13.890> impact<00:01:14.220> than<00:01:14.400> I

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549 
he's still having a bigger impact than I

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:16.280 
he's still having a bigger impact than I
thought<00:01:15.000> he<00:01:15.060> would<00:01:15.240> because<00:01:15.720> I<00:01:15.840> didn't<00:01:16.049> expect

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
thought he would because I didn't expect

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:19.070 
thought he would because I didn't expect
him<00:01:16.470> to<00:01:16.530> come<00:01:16.710> back<00:01:16.979> really<00:01:17.460> and<00:01:17.869> you<00:01:18.869> know<00:01:18.960> we

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.080 
him to come back really and you know we

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:20.920 
him to come back really and you know we
learn<00:01:19.259> about<00:01:19.290> Bellamy<00:01:20.040> going<00:01:20.280> to<00:01:20.340> skype<00:01:20.640> yeah

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:20.930 
learn about Bellamy going to skype yeah

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:23.179 
learn about Bellamy going to skype yeah
which<00:01:21.930> leads<00:01:22.229> me<00:01:22.320> to<00:01:22.409> believe<00:01:22.500> that<00:01:22.770> he<00:01:23.040> might

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:23.189 
which leads me to believe that he might

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:24.859 
which leads me to believe that he might
have<00:01:23.340> you<00:01:23.580> might<00:01:23.729> have<00:01:23.880> really<00:01:24.210> changed<00:01:24.450> I

00:03:31.979 --> 00:03:31.989 
chapters but yeah hmm not really much

00:03:31.989 --> 00:03:35.250 
chapters but yeah hmm not really much
else<00:03:32.049> to<00:03:32.350> talk<00:03:32.590> about<00:03:33.600> Bellamy<00:03:34.600> recognized

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:35.260 
else to talk about Bellamy recognized

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:40.050 
else to talk about Bellamy recognized
Luffy<00:03:36.120> but<00:03:37.120> that's<00:03:37.569> really<00:03:37.799> what's<00:03:39.060> not

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:40.060 
Luffy but that's really what's not

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:42.960 
Luffy but that's really what's not
really<00:03:40.209> to<00:03:40.329> be<00:03:40.450> video<00:03:41.370> it<00:03:42.370> was<00:03:42.489> talking<00:03:42.819> about

00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:42.970 
really to be video it was talking about

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:44.879 
really to be video it was talking about
Bellamy<00:03:43.389> bring<00:03:43.600> him<00:03:43.720> back<00:03:43.900> a<00:03:43.930> pillar<00:03:44.350> of<00:03:44.440> gold

00:03:44.879 --> 00:03:44.889 
Bellamy bring him back a pillar of gold

00:03:44.889 --> 00:03:46.680 
Bellamy bring him back a pillar of gold
for<00:03:45.340> doflamingo<00:03:45.549> so<00:03:46.120> I<00:03:46.180> guess<00:03:46.329> that's<00:03:46.510> how<00:03:46.630> he

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:46.690 
for doflamingo so I guess that's how he

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:48.690 
for doflamingo so I guess that's how he
redeemed<00:03:47.170> himself<00:03:47.170> and<00:03:47.829> he's<00:03:48.250> really<00:03:48.549> just

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:48.700 
redeemed himself and he's really just

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:51.599 
redeemed himself and he's really just
like<00:03:49.630> trying<00:03:50.019> to<00:03:50.109> get<00:03:50.319> back<00:03:50.769> on<00:03:50.980> doe<00:03:51.190> flamingos

like trying to get back on doe flamingos

00:03:51.609 --> 00:03:52.860 
like trying to get back on doe flamingos
good<00:03:51.819> side<00:03:52.060> and<00:03:52.209> if<00:03:52.299> he<00:03:52.389> wins<00:03:52.569> this<00:03:52.660> tournament

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:52.870 
good side and if he wins this tournament

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:55.020 
good side and if he wins this tournament
he'll<00:03:53.170> be<00:03:53.260> on<00:03:53.350> the<00:03:53.380> executive<00:03:53.980> staff<00:03:54.310> so<00:03:54.880> it's
