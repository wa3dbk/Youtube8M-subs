on how to make trees and so I'm posting
the<00:00:21.600> video<00:00:21.869> right<00:00:22.140> now<00:00:22.170> on<00:00:22.880> a<00:00:23.880> few<00:00:24.330> ways<00:00:24.449> that

the video right now on a few ways that
you<00:00:24.720> can<00:00:24.840> make<00:00:24.960> trees<00:00:25.230> the<00:00:25.410> first<00:00:25.619> way<00:00:25.859> is<00:00:26.070> when

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:26.670 
you can make trees the first way is when

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:28.429 
you can make trees the first way is when
you<00:00:26.760> go<00:00:26.880> to<00:00:26.939> Michael's<00:00:27.390> you<00:00:27.689> can<00:00:27.840> get<00:00:27.990> a<00:00:28.019> potted

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:28.439 
you go to Michael's you can get a potted

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:30.380 
you go to Michael's you can get a potted
plant<00:00:28.470> and<00:00:29.250> they<00:00:29.369> have<00:00:29.699> little<00:00:29.939> ends<00:00:30.240> that

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:30.390 
plant and they have little ends that

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:33.530 
plant and they have little ends that
look<00:00:30.480> like<00:00:30.630> this<00:00:31.700> you<00:00:32.700> can<00:00:32.850> buy<00:00:32.969> the<00:00:33.030> plant<00:00:33.390> and

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:33.540 
look like this you can buy the plant and

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:35.690 
look like this you can buy the plant and
then<00:00:33.630> snip<00:00:33.930> them<00:00:34.140> off<00:00:34.260> the<00:00:35.250> plant<00:00:35.489> would<00:00:35.640> be

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:35.700 
then snip them off the plant would be

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:37.370 
then snip them off the plant would be
ten<00:00:36.270> dollars<00:00:36.690> and<00:00:36.930> you<00:00:36.960> would<00:00:37.110> get<00:00:37.290> about

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:37.380 
ten dollars and you would get about

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:39.709 
ten dollars and you would get about
twenty<00:00:37.980> or<00:00:38.010> thirty<00:00:38.280> of<00:00:38.370> these<00:00:38.550> little<00:00:38.730> trees

00:00:39.709 --> 00:00:39.719 
twenty or thirty of these little trees

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:44.420 
twenty or thirty of these little trees
for<00:00:40.469> size<00:00:40.620> comparison<00:00:40.649> here's<00:00:41.340> a<00:00:41.399> razor<00:00:43.430> okay

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
for size comparison here's a razor okay

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:49.310 
for size comparison here's a razor okay
and<00:00:44.700> so<00:00:45.770> basically<00:00:47.210> what<00:00:48.210> I<00:00:48.270> would<00:00:48.420> have<00:00:48.719> is<00:00:49.079> it

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320 
and so basically what I would have is it

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:51.560 
and so basically what I would have is it
I<00:00:49.469> would<00:00:49.860> take<00:00:50.100> the<00:00:50.250> little<00:00:50.460> the<00:00:51.000> edge<00:00:51.149> after<00:00:51.539> I

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570 
I would take the little the edge after I

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:53.990 
I would take the little the edge after I
cut<00:00:51.809> it<00:00:51.899> off<00:00:52.020> from<00:00:52.110> the<00:00:52.289> plant<00:00:52.530> I<00:00:52.800> have<00:00:53.760> a<00:00:53.820> piece

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 
cut it off from the plant I have a piece

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:59.060 
cut it off from the plant I have a piece
of<00:00:54.120> styrofoam<00:00:54.300> and<00:00:55.219> I<00:00:56.219> could<00:00:56.430> poke<00:00:56.699> a<00:00:56.730> hole<00:00:58.070> and

00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070 
of styrofoam and I could poke a hole and

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:01.160 
of styrofoam and I could poke a hole and
then<00:01:00.059> I<00:01:00.180> could<00:01:00.329> stick<00:01:00.539> the<00:01:00.660> plant<00:01:00.899> in<00:01:01.020> with

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
then I could stick the plant in with

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:04.369 
then I could stick the plant in with
some<00:01:01.320> glue<00:01:02.420> all<00:01:03.420> right<00:01:03.570> so<00:01:03.809> now<00:01:03.930> is<00:01:04.049> yours<00:01:04.229> two

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
some glue all right so now is yours two

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:05.630 
some glue all right so now is yours two
types<00:01:04.589> of<00:01:04.710> trees<00:01:04.949> the<00:01:05.280> one<00:01:05.400> that<00:01:05.549> I<00:01:05.610> just

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
types of trees the one that I just

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:08.330 
types of trees the one that I just
showed<00:01:06.000> you<00:01:06.060> that<00:01:06.770> looks<00:01:07.770> really<00:01:07.950> good<00:01:08.159> with

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 
showed you that looks really good with

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:10.100 
showed you that looks really good with
this<00:01:08.430> type<00:01:08.640> of<00:01:08.670> blank<00:01:09.030> with<00:01:09.299> this<00:01:09.540> type<00:01:09.750> of<00:01:09.780> um

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
this type of blank with this type of um

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:13.100 
this type of blank with this type of um
pill<00:01:10.530> and<00:01:10.830> then<00:01:11.790> another<00:01:12.030> type<00:01:12.360> is<00:01:12.540> this<00:01:12.750> dead

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
pill and then another type is this dead

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:15.920 
pill and then another type is this dead
tree<00:01:13.140> that's<00:01:14.040> swaying<00:01:14.369> in<00:01:14.520> the<00:01:14.549> wind<00:01:14.930> like

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930 
tree that's swaying in the wind like

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:19.670 
tree that's swaying in the wind like
that<00:01:16.189> okay<00:01:17.189> and<00:01:17.400> I<00:01:18.330> just<00:01:18.570> cut<00:01:19.110> that<00:01:19.229> off<00:01:19.290> of<00:01:19.590> a

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.680 
that okay and I just cut that off of a

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:21.770 
that okay and I just cut that off of a
little<00:01:19.860> hedge<00:01:20.220> that<00:01:20.250> I<00:01:20.610> found<00:01:20.850> the<00:01:21.299> hedge

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
little hedge that I found the hedge

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:23.539 
little hedge that I found the hedge
somewhere<00:01:22.259> along<00:01:22.560> my<00:01:22.799> street<00:01:23.130> in<00:01:23.250> my<00:01:23.400> old

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:23.549 
somewhere along my street in my old

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:26.539 
somewhere along my street in my old
house<00:01:23.729> so<00:01:24.000> I<00:01:24.810> just<00:01:25.290> cut<00:01:26.040> a<00:01:26.070> couple<00:01:26.250> of<00:01:26.430> these

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:26.549 
house so I just cut a couple of these

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:27.950 
house so I just cut a couple of these
off<00:01:26.759> and<00:01:26.970> stabbed<00:01:27.240> them<00:01:27.450> into<00:01:27.689> the<00:01:27.780> styrofoam

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960 
off and stabbed them into the styrofoam

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:29.990 
off and stabbed them into the styrofoam
and<00:01:28.409> they<00:01:28.500> look<00:01:28.680> good<00:01:28.860> for<00:01:29.369> more<00:01:29.549> detail<00:01:29.850> you

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
and they look good for more detail you

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.030 
and they look good for more detail you
can<00:01:30.119> add<00:01:30.240> some<00:01:30.420> block<00:01:30.689> around<00:01:30.900> the<00:01:31.110> bottom<00:01:31.470> in

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
can add some block around the bottom in

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:34.760 
can add some block around the bottom in
a<00:01:32.970> different<00:01:33.360> color<00:01:33.780> or<00:01:34.140> the<00:01:34.229> same<00:01:34.380> color<00:01:34.560> as

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770 
a different color or the same color as

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:38.539 
a different color or the same color as
you<00:01:34.979> use<00:01:35.189> this<00:01:35.810> and<00:01:36.860> so<00:01:37.860> those<00:01:38.130> are<00:01:38.280> two<00:01:38.430> ways

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:38.549 
you use this and so those are two ways

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:41.480 
you use this and so those are two ways
to<00:01:38.610> make<00:01:38.939> trees<00:01:39.240> and<00:01:39.810> now<00:01:40.740> the<00:01:40.799> last<00:01:41.100> way<00:01:41.310> that

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
to make trees and now the last way that

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:42.980 
to make trees and now the last way that
you<00:01:41.579> can<00:01:41.729> make<00:01:41.850> a<00:01:41.880> tree<00:01:42.150> I<00:01:42.180> don't<00:01:42.540> have<00:01:42.689> a<00:01:42.720> pick

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990 
you can make a tree I don't have a pick

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:44.870 
you can make a tree I don't have a pick
any<00:01:43.200> with<00:01:43.619> me<00:01:43.649> because<00:01:44.159> I<00:01:44.189> don't<00:01:44.369> have<00:01:44.670> any

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880 
any with me because I don't have any

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:48.380 
any with me because I don't have any
clay<00:01:45.439> but<00:01:46.439> you<00:01:46.530> can<00:01:46.680> mold<00:01:46.920> a<00:01:47.130> strange<00:01:47.880> tree<00:01:48.240> out

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390 
clay but you can mold a strange tree out

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:50.960 
clay but you can mold a strange tree out
of<00:01:48.540> clay<00:01:48.780> and<00:01:49.020> then<00:01:50.009> you<00:01:50.159> can<00:01:50.310> take<00:01:50.490> the<00:01:50.790> little

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:50.970 
of clay and then you can take the little

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:54.289 
of clay and then you can take the little
bristles<00:01:51.630> from<00:01:51.960> this<00:01:52.200> tree<00:01:52.670> or<00:01:53.670> you<00:01:53.970> can<00:01:54.119> take

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:54.299 
bristles from this tree or you can take

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:58.550
