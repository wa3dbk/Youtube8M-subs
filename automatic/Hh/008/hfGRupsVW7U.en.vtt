 now it 's personal let's solve it now 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:54.570
 this problem pcp a fan is that I he 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:57.590
 usually walking boot and 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:59.910
 solve is the following you will have to 

00:00:57.590 --> 00:01:03.000
 Turning on your computer's power will 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:04.799
 remove all power cables at all 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.750
 cars that are connected to a 

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:09.150
 computer so that it works and does not 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:11.549
 can tolerate the energy will open the 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:15.240
 cabinet will screw you in and unscrew 

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:19.369
 an attractive market to use you will 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:24.450
 remove that cover from the case cover 

00:01:19.369 --> 00:01:26.850
 and it's the following we're going to have to 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:28.350
 and tactics of the body and how it 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:30.720
 You will see that we will see that 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:34.170
 this metal part that is not painted 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:37.070
 will put two hands and will leave here 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:40.829
 for a while 

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:42.990
 Well done you can already move here 

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:45.990
 inside it is clear that if you are 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:48.810
 using your computer you should tell the 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:50.790
 and left ten minutes stopped here. 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:53.880
 It will cool and then it will be done now. 

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:55.890
 if it is not a year it will be off 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:58.049
 You can do what I already showed you. 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:02:01.710
 come straight here puts the hand open the 

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:04.049
 cabinet puts your hand and you can already 

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:06.540
 here to put 29 that this part 

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:09.570
 metal that was not painted 

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:11.880
 well two of the sons of God to 

00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:15.510
 give this sector problem the phone 

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:18.210
 the first is that the connector you 

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:20.700
 connects your processor may be 

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:23.190
 in the wrong place in the club 

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:25.800
 wrong then it means do you go 

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:28.320
 look for another location to connect 

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:32.700
 where will fit perfectly this 

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:34.560
 plugin that had here three times nor 

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:37.470
 you will look for another place where you 

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:41.160
 connected can be engaged a fondness 

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:45.930
 here you will find another place to 

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:47.670
 fit it and you go testing put 

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:49.920
 In that place you pick up the 

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:51.990
 computer again to see if it will 

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:54.870
 will not normally ask you to 

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:56.790
 attend this does not turn to tighten 

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:59.880
 If you disconnect it connects to your 

00:02:56.790 --> 00:03:02.370
 new and does the same thing to look for another 

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:03.510
 place to fit done it did not 

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:06.300
 not right 

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:09.180
 another possible is that the club can 

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:11.730
 to be in that place then in case you should 

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:14.130
 buy another cooler make a test 

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:16.320
 against another cooler of course said 

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:18.450
 others possible with the possible 

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:20.790
 problems that cause this but the 

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:22.769
 these would be 

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:25.320
 so I guess it was that kind of thing 

00:03:22.769 --> 00:03:27.450
 so these are the two possible mistakes 

00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:30.510
 which can cause the hospital problem 

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:32.430
 funk the connector state a course is 

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:34.049
 connected in the wrong place or 

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:35.720
 event is working 

00:03:34.049 --> 00:03:41.310
 of course you can give bionz 

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:42.750
 look for it and power and see if it's wrong 

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:44.790
 kill my schedule 

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:46.950
 I think it's too risky, you should not 

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:49.769
 to do this have to get a person 

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:51.799
 because it really talks about how to mess with 

00:03:49.769 --> 00:03:54.780
 but this is not usually beyonce 

00:03:51.799 --> 00:03:57.030
 wrong telemarketing connector or the 

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:57.600
 processor of course, how was it? 

00:03:57.030 --> 00:04:00.630
 Speaking 

00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:02.820
 there are other possible mistakes but 

00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:04.980
 the main the one that gives you 

00:04:02.820 --> 00:04:07.080
 check and even solve the problem 

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:07.980
 problem and I hope you have 

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:09.989
 Enjoyed the class 

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:12.209
 thank you to watch the video and even 

00:04:09.989 --> 00:04:14.720
