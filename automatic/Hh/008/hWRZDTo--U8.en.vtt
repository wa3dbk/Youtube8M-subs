00:00:08.090 --> 00:00:13.570
 so 

00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:13.570
 yes I 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:19.280
 here it is 

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:22.960
 with my fins but he should 

00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:26.510
 represent so-called creek basin 

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:29.570
 and the goal has actually been 

00:00:26.510 --> 00:00:33.170
 the current really like a creek 

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:34.370
 just to have run in one direction me 

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:40.790
 not quite successful 

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:45.080
 but up here you see, for example 

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:46.960
 both pumps and now here 

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:54.680
 go on 

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:57.260
 You see her behind for me okay though 

00:00:54.680 --> 00:01:01.720
 For example, they are against here 

00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:04.820
 fourth here, the water is attracted 

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:06.560
 sometimes a pipe system to the 

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:10.010
 located below the gravel 

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:14.420
 or sand returned and 

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:17.299
 here again to the point so fins 

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:19.190
 suckers need a lot of flow the two 

00:01:17.299 --> 00:01:21.500
 score in here have done 

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:24.860
 together if I am right now 1500 

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:26.719
 liter was too little for me therefore 

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:29.920
 even the small flow pump with 

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:33.200
 race which also makes 750 liters 

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:35.000
 and I already believe that I am here 

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:41.259
 hammer out a reasonable flow 

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:43.880
 have stones as you can see 

00:01:41.259 --> 00:01:46.929
 beautiful field what flowed clean 

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:53.630
 love and need you too 

00:01:46.929 --> 00:01:56.270
 what so many old classes need 

00:01:53.630 --> 00:02:00.020
 worry do not eat the albums but 

00:01:56.270 --> 00:02:03.320
 more grew up or the 

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:07.579
 microorganisms in those old ones 

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:09.200
 So let's live here now 

00:02:07.579 --> 00:02:14.040
 see if we flowed in cleaner 

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:15.920
 get there 

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:22.079
 he is a bit out of focus i think 

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:24.569
 but there sits one and see if we 

00:02:22.079 --> 00:02:25.859
 Now here you can find a place here 

00:02:24.569 --> 00:02:28.260
 also give the same feed Rhine 

00:02:25.859 --> 00:02:32.099
 and I have today or respectively 

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:34.650
 yesterday in the aquaristik magazine 

00:02:32.099 --> 00:02:41.700
 your feed sample forms bl inside 

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:46.079
 had named moment plankton pure by 

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:50.310
 jbl that it's this stuff here it should 

00:02:46.079 --> 00:02:52.169
 according to jbl someday i believe her 

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:52.970
 said something from 7 october in the trade 

00:02:52.169 --> 00:02:55.049
 give 

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:59.849
 Today I will always sample the feed 

00:02:55.049 --> 00:03:03.799
 give up because yes as I said flowed 

00:02:59.849 --> 00:03:07.049
 suckers actually love it 

00:03:03.799 --> 00:03:09.659
 microorganisms in the alps 

00:03:07.049 --> 00:03:11.250
 maybe like to try it 

00:03:09.659 --> 00:03:12.930
 went here now 1 2 forward 

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:15.900
 Really that we go in now 

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:18.829
 and then we will see if they are 

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:18.829
 be attracted 

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:44.080
 so here now here anybody 

00:03:41.709 --> 00:03:49.330
 upright i would have the bag before 

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:50.950
 had washed and now with me 

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:52.420
 not somehow decoupled here 

00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:56.650
 things like other people i know what 

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:58.120
 been here on the toilet and then fuck not 

00:03:56.650 --> 00:04:00.459
 hands washed and bags 

00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:02.620
 have packed if I do not like something 

00:04:00.459 --> 00:04:04.560
 I have come to the basin before 

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:07.989
 once washed off 

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:09.549
 Thus we see here whether there 

00:04:07.989 --> 00:04:13.109
 in the corner you can now here 

00:04:09.549 --> 00:04:17.250
 not see what is happening 

00:04:13.109 --> 00:04:17.250
 Let's see how it goes on here 

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:30.250
 here is also just one 

00:04:26.729 --> 00:04:32.580
 but unfortunately god for you not to 

00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:32.580
 see 

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:51.009
 Here we have an example where is 

00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:53.710
 he is there now you are these 

00:04:51.009 --> 00:05:02.039
 fantastic they look like little ones 

00:04:53.710 --> 00:05:10.149
 minirÃ¶cken and yes in this basin 

00:05:02.039 --> 00:05:12.339
 There are currently 20 animals is one 

00:05:10.149 --> 00:05:14.129
 a little bit I realized was not clear 

00:05:12.339 --> 00:05:19.089
 different 

00:05:14.129 --> 00:05:20.469
 but look up here is 

00:05:19.089 --> 00:05:22.649
 someone on the points head you can 

00:05:20.469 --> 00:05:35.589
 also do not see 

00:05:22.649 --> 00:05:37.960
 yes because here so well in the next 

00:05:35.589 --> 00:05:40.169
 I will talk a little bit more about it 

00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:42.399
 the fins concern 

00:05:40.169 --> 00:05:47.349
 At the moment it should have been now 

00:05:42.399 --> 00:05:51.629
 the basin is a bit strong 

00:05:47.349 --> 00:05:57.099
 but as outdated as I said 

00:05:51.629 --> 00:06:01.629
 fins even love this and yes too 

00:05:57.099 --> 00:06:06.729
 in the filthy algae they put their eggs 

00:06:01.629 --> 00:06:09.249
 free and there we hope sooner or 

00:06:06.729 --> 00:06:11.199
 later on offspring it could be here 

00:06:09.249 --> 00:06:17.680
 just a look over the 

00:06:11.199 --> 00:06:20.800
 stone over rough 

00:06:17.680 --> 00:06:24.399
 everything blurs is the same 

00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:27.240
 a bit unfavorable okay that should be it then 

00:06:24.399 --> 00:06:27.240
 have been first
