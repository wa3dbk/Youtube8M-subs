00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:36.659 
this cage okay well under this which is

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:38.120 
this cage okay well under this which is
there's<00:01:36.930> a<00:01:36.990> cage<00:01:37.229> that<00:01:37.530> you<00:01:37.590> can<00:01:37.680> climb<00:01:37.860> onto

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.130 
there's a cage that you can climb onto

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:39.770 
there's a cage that you can climb onto
their<00:01:38.280> i'm<00:01:38.579> going<00:01:38.909> to<00:01:38.970> show<00:01:39.090> you<00:01:39.119> a<00:01:39.240> route<00:01:39.479> but

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 
their i'm going to show you a route but

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:42.859 
their i'm going to show you a route but
uh<00:01:40.430> it's<00:01:41.430> basically<00:01:41.790> a<00:01:41.909> speedrunning<00:01:42.570> route

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:42.869 
uh it's basically a speedrunning route

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:45.260 
uh it's basically a speedrunning route
but<00:01:43.470> i<00:01:43.500> find<00:01:44.040> it<00:01:44.100> a<00:01:44.220> lot<00:01:44.340> easier<00:01:44.520> as<00:01:45.000> well<00:01:45.060> i

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:45.270 
but i find it a lot easier as well i

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:46.609 
but i find it a lot easier as well i
think<00:01:45.390> it<00:01:45.630> is<00:01:45.659> meant<00:01:45.960> to<00:01:46.020> be<00:01:46.110> easier<00:01:46.470> as<00:01:46.590> well

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:46.619 
think it is meant to be easier as well

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:48.319 
think it is meant to be easier as well
why<00:01:47.310> don't<00:01:47.490> think<00:01:47.640> nintendo<00:01:48.000> put<00:01:48.149> it<00:01:48.240> in

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:48.329 
why don't think nintendo put it in

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:50.870 
why don't think nintendo put it in

you remember that

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:14.070 
you remember that
on<00:02:12.040> make<00:02:12.940> sure<00:02:12.970> you<00:02:13.120> get<00:02:13.270> yourself<00:02:13.390> soaked<00:02:13.900> and

just spin and it's literally lonesome
repeat<00:02:17.019> I<00:02:17.140> guess<00:02:17.349> I<00:02:17.440> even<00:02:17.680> applies<00:02:17.950> here

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:18.160 
repeat I guess I even applies here

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:20.850 
repeat I guess I even applies here
properly<00:02:18.430> that's<00:02:19.420> literally<00:02:19.840> here<00:02:20.080> so<00:02:20.769> just

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:20.860 
properly that's literally here so just

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:23.070 
properly that's literally here so just
do<00:02:21.129> until<00:02:21.459> you've<00:02:21.550> got<00:02:21.580> enough<00:02:22.090> space<00:02:22.390> to<00:02:22.420> jump

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:23.080 
do until you've got enough space to jump

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:26.000 
do until you've got enough space to jump
and<00:02:23.940> jump<00:02:24.940> over<00:02:25.060> the<00:02:25.239> other<00:02:25.390> side<00:02:25.420> and

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:26.010 
and jump over the other side and

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:29.220 
and jump over the other side and
basically<00:02:27.010> talk<00:02:27.310> to<00:02:27.489> them<00:02:27.640> there<00:02:27.819> I<00:02:28.230> think

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:29.230 
basically talk to them there I think

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:31.620

00:07:13.370 --> 00:07:13.380 
I like to do too sure I'm per episode I

00:07:13.380 --> 00:07:16.159 
I like to do too sure I'm per episode I
would<00:07:13.590> do<00:07:13.740> more<00:07:13.979> but<00:07:14.909> that's<00:07:15.509> been<00:07:15.840> the<00:07:15.930> way<00:07:16.050> it

00:07:16.159 --> 00:07:16.169 
would do more but that's been the way it

00:07:16.169 --> 00:07:19.010 
would do more but that's been the way it
is<00:07:16.259> through<00:07:16.560> the<00:07:16.650> whole<00:07:16.830> serious<00:07:17.669> project<00:07:18.240> so

00:07:19.010 --> 00:07:19.020
