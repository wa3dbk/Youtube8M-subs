00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:18.130 
long did I play soccer for him why did I

00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:21.150

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:21.160 
stopped I played from probably about

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:24.379

nine years old up until about eighteen

00:04:24.389 --> 00:04:27.540 
nine years old up until about eighteen
because<00:04:25.389> all<00:04:26.380> of<00:04:26.650> the<00:04:26.710> jobs<00:04:27.010> they<00:04:27.190> seemed<00:04:27.370> to

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:27.550 
because all of the jobs they seemed to

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:29.310 
because all of the jobs they seemed to
have<00:04:27.580> I<00:04:28.030> could<00:04:28.240> never<00:04:28.449> guarantee<00:04:29.050> that<00:04:29.260> I

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:29.320 
have I could never guarantee that I

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:31.770 
have I could never guarantee that I
would<00:04:29.530> be<00:04:29.680> off<00:04:29.919> on<00:04:30.340> like<00:04:30.490> a<00:04:30.550> Saturday<00:04:31.150> or<00:04:31.750> a

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:31.780 
would be off on like a Saturday or a

00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:35.790 
would be off on like a Saturday or a
Sunday<00:04:32.190> so<00:04:33.190> I<00:04:33.220> just<00:04:33.610> never<00:04:34.169> never<00:04:35.169> signed<00:04:35.560> up

00:04:35.790 --> 00:04:35.800 
Sunday so I just never never signed up

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:39.210 
Sunday so I just never never signed up
after<00:04:36.039> that<00:04:37.080> how<00:04:38.080> do<00:04:38.139> I<00:04:38.260> feel<00:04:38.530> about<00:04:38.560> growing

00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:39.220 
after that how do I feel about growing

00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:42.210 
after that how do I feel about growing
older<00:04:39.699> as<00:04:39.789> a<00:04:39.820> gamer<00:04:40.180> do<00:04:41.020> I<00:04:41.080> feel<00:04:41.530> I'll<00:04:41.889> be<00:04:42.130> able

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:42.220 
older as a gamer do I feel I'll be able

00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:44.250 
older as a gamer do I feel I'll be able
to<00:04:42.310> maintain<00:04:42.639> my<00:04:42.940> abilities<00:04:43.600> on<00:04:43.900> well<00:04:44.110> they

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:44.260 
to maintain my abilities on well they

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:48.540 
to maintain my abilities on well they
decline<00:04:45.330> this<00:04:46.330> is<00:04:46.449> a<00:04:46.479> very<00:04:46.810> good<00:04:46.960> question<00:04:47.550> I

00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:48.550 
decline this is a very good question I

00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:50.640 
decline this is a very good question I
don't<00:04:49.479> really<00:04:49.810> have<00:04:49.990> an<00:04:50.110> opinion<00:04:50.410> about

00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:50.650 
don't really have an opinion about

00:04:50.650 --> 00:04:52.290 
don't really have an opinion about
growing<00:04:51.010> older<00:04:51.280> because<00:04:51.370> I<00:04:51.729> don't<00:04:52.000> personally

00:04:52.290 --> 00:04:52.300 
growing older because I don't personally

00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:55.830 
growing older because I don't personally
think<00:04:52.900> that<00:04:52.990> my<00:04:53.320> abilities<00:04:54.070> or<00:04:54.310> anything<00:04:54.840> are

00:04:55.830 --> 00:04:55.840 
think that my abilities or anything are

00:04:55.840 --> 00:04:59.460 
think that my abilities or anything are
something<00:04:56.530> that<00:04:56.560> I<00:04:56.710> should<00:04:57.010> cherish<00:04:58.440> but<00:04:59.440> I

00:04:59.460 --> 00:04:59.470 
something that I should cherish but I

00:04:59.470 --> 00:05:02.279 
something that I should cherish but I
think<00:05:00.000> it's<00:05:01.000> a<00:05:01.180> pretty<00:05:01.419> well-known<00:05:01.660> factor

00:05:02.279 --> 00:05:02.289 
think it's a pretty well-known factor

00:05:02.289 --> 00:05:04.320 
think it's a pretty well-known factor
like<00:05:02.440> the<00:05:02.590> owner<00:05:02.800> you<00:05:03.010> get<00:05:03.220> your<00:05:03.550> reaction

00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:04.330 
like the owner you get your reaction

00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:09.240 
like the owner you get your reaction
time<00:05:04.539> soft<00:05:04.990> just<00:05:05.229> declines<00:05:06.479> so<00:05:07.479> I<00:05:08.250> don't

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:09.250 
time soft just declines so I don't

00:05:09.250 --> 00:05:12.420 
time soft just declines so I don't
necessarily<00:05:09.539> feel<00:05:10.650> anything<00:05:11.650> about<00:05:12.070> growing

00:05:12.420 --> 00:05:12.430 
necessarily feel anything about growing

00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:14.580 
necessarily feel anything about growing
older<00:05:12.789> I<00:05:13.000> thought<00:05:13.870> this<00:05:14.020> was<00:05:14.200> gonna<00:05:14.320> be<00:05:14.410> about

00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:14.590 
older I thought this was gonna be about

00:05:14.590 --> 00:05:16.500 
older I thought this was gonna be about
the<00:05:14.830> stigma<00:05:15.310> that<00:05:15.340> old<00:05:15.700> people<00:05:16.210> shouldn't

00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:16.510 
the stigma that old people shouldn't

00:05:16.510 --> 00:05:18.450 
the stigma that old people shouldn't
older<00:05:17.289> people<00:05:17.710> shouldn't<00:05:17.919> play<00:05:18.070> games<00:05:18.310> which

00:05:18.450 --> 00:05:18.460 
older people shouldn't play games which

00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:20.730 
older people shouldn't play games which
i<00:05:18.610> think<00:05:18.669> is<00:05:18.970> fucking<00:05:19.330> ridiculous<00:05:19.810> if<00:05:20.470> you're

00:05:20.730 --> 00:05:20.740 
i think is fucking ridiculous if you're

00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:23.279 
i think is fucking ridiculous if you're
older<00:05:21.280> if<00:05:21.669> you're<00:05:21.970> if<00:05:22.570> you<00:05:22.750> have<00:05:22.960> you

00:05:23.279 --> 00:05:23.289 
older if you're if you have you

00:05:23.289 --> 00:05:25.800 
older if you're if you have you
