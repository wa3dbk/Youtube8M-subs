00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
heard that I did my research on this I'm

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:54.619 
heard that I did my research on this I'm
gonna<00:00:51.390> bleed<00:00:51.629> wakey<00:00:52.110> and<00:00:52.350> it<00:00:52.710> says<00:00:53.010> that<00:00:53.629> it

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
gonna bleed wakey and it says that it

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:55.760 
gonna bleed wakey and it says that it
says<00:00:54.809> that<00:00:54.930> this<00:00:55.079> one's<00:00:55.289> a<00:00:55.440> little<00:00:55.559> bit

heavier<00:00:56.129> or<00:00:56.610> something<00:00:57.030> and<00:00:57.239> there's<00:00:57.360> a

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
heavier or something and there's a

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:58.849 
heavier or something and there's a
little<00:00:57.600> bit<00:00:57.750> more<00:00:57.870> recoil<00:00:58.260> so<00:00:58.559> it's<00:00:58.680> better

00:00:58.849 --> 00:00:58.859 
little bit more recoil so it's better

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:01.189 
little bit more recoil so it's better
than<00:00:59.039> l-drago<00:00:59.370> destroy<00:00:59.960> actually<00:01:00.960> it<00:01:01.020> does

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199 
than l-drago destroy actually it does

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:02.450 
than l-drago destroy actually it does
look<00:01:01.379> different<00:01:01.410> that's<00:01:01.920> actually<00:01:02.219> kind<00:01:02.430> of
