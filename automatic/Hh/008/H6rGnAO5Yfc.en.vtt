suspension<00:00:47.520> which<00:00:47.879> is<00:00:47.910> on<00:00:48.180> this<00:00:48.360> unit<00:00:48.840> we've

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620 
suspension which is on this unit we've

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:52.069 
suspension which is on this unit we've
got<00:00:49.829> a<00:00:49.859> scaffolding<00:00:50.570> connector<00:00:51.570> on<00:00:51.780> the<00:00:51.840> other

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
got a scaffolding connector on the other

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:55.639 
got a scaffolding connector on the other
unit<00:00:52.699> to<00:00:53.699> feed<00:00:53.910> the<00:00:54.120> Rope<00:00:54.300> through<00:00:54.410> the<00:00:55.410> rope

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:55.649 
unit to feed the Rope through the rope

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:58.900 
unit to feed the Rope through the rope
just<00:00:56.039> feeds<00:00:56.340> through<00:00:56.899> around<00:00:57.899> the<00:00:58.140> pulley

00:00:58.900 --> 00:00:58.910 
just feeds through around the pulley

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:01.939 
just feeds through around the pulley
back<00:00:59.910> out<00:01:00.180> and<00:01:00.899> we<00:01:01.019> have<00:01:01.170> a<00:01:01.199> little<00:01:01.500> blocking

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
back out and we have a little blocking

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:03.709 
back out and we have a little blocking
mechanism<00:01:02.129> which<00:01:02.820> is<00:01:02.850> a<00:01:03.000> little<00:01:03.239> braking

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719 
mechanism which is a little braking

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:06.320 
mechanism which is a little braking
mechanism<00:01:03.870> which<00:01:04.769> is<00:01:05.040> the<00:01:05.190> twist<00:01:05.489> that<00:01:06.060> we've

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
mechanism which is the twist that we've

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:07.460 
mechanism which is the twist that we've
incorporated

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470 
incorporated

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:11.600 
incorporated
so<00:01:08.100> once<00:01:08.670> the<00:01:08.880> rope<00:01:09.090> spent<00:01:09.540> through<00:01:10.280> you<00:01:11.280> can

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
so once the rope spent through you can

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:15.230 
so once the rope spent through you can
lift<00:01:12.030> the<00:01:12.240> load<00:01:12.450> safe<00:01:12.810> way<00:01:13.080> so<00:01:14.009> what<00:01:14.610> we<00:01:14.729> do<00:01:14.909> we

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
lift the load safe way so what we do we

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:17.749 
lift the load safe way so what we do we
just<00:01:15.270> create<00:01:15.750> a<00:01:15.810> 15<00:01:16.200> degree<00:01:16.439> angle<00:01:16.650> you<00:01:17.250> can

00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:17.759 
just create a 15 degree angle you can

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:20.090 
just create a 15 degree angle you can
lift<00:01:17.970> it<00:01:18.180> up<00:01:18.390> and<00:01:18.689> then<00:01:18.750> what<00:01:19.530> we<00:01:19.650> can<00:01:19.799> do<00:01:19.979> is

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.100 
lift it up and then what we can do is

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:22.910 
lift it up and then what we can do is
put<00:01:20.310> the<00:01:20.430> rope<00:01:20.640> back<00:01:20.909> in<00:01:21.119> vertically<00:01:21.890> into<00:01:22.890> a

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
put the rope back in vertically into a

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:25.399 
put the rope back in vertically into a
vertical<00:01:23.189> plane<00:01:23.790> and<00:01:24.119> then<00:01:24.570> the<00:01:24.750> mechanism

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409 
vertical plane and then the mechanism

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:27.830 
vertical plane and then the mechanism
basically<00:01:25.680> locks<00:01:26.250> onto<00:01:26.549> the<00:01:26.850> rope<00:01:27.090> through

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
basically locks onto the rope through

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:31.130 
basically locks onto the rope through
using<00:01:28.079> your<00:01:28.320> suspension<00:01:29.540> never<00:01:30.540> leave<00:01:30.810> a<00:01:30.840> load

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.140 
using your suspension never leave a load

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:34.730 
using your suspension never leave a load
of<00:01:31.350> suspended<00:01:32.040> but<00:01:32.579> as<00:01:32.880> a<00:01:33.240> safety<00:01:33.630> feature<00:01:34.049> is

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740 
of suspended but as a safety feature is

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:38.719 
of suspended but as a safety feature is
bang<00:01:35.159> on<00:01:35.340> the<00:01:35.520> money<00:01:35.670> so<00:01:36.540> to<00:01:37.020> release<00:01:37.729> create

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:38.729 
bang on the money so to release create

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:42.410 
bang on the money so to release create
the<00:01:38.939> sling<00:01:39.180> need<00:01:39.390> angle<00:01:39.780> 15<00:01:40.560> degrees<00:01:41.210> you<00:01:42.210> hear

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:42.420 
the sling need angle 15 degrees you hear

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:44.899 
the sling need angle 15 degrees you hear
the<00:01:42.600> brake<00:01:43.079> mechanism<00:01:43.290> lock<00:01:43.890> off<00:01:44.159> and<00:01:44.490> then

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:44.909 
the brake mechanism lock off and then

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:46.990 
the brake mechanism lock off and then
you<00:01:45.000> can<00:01:45.030> lower<00:01:45.450> it<00:01:45.630> to<00:01:45.659> the<00:01:45.810> ground

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:47.000 
you can lower it to the ground

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.550 
you can lower it to the ground
we<00:01:48.000> thought<00:01:48.540> we'd<00:01:48.689> like<00:01:48.810> to<00:01:49.020> just<00:01:49.140> give<00:01:49.380> you<00:01:49.409> a
