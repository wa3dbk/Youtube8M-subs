the<00:00:02.850> develop<00:00:03.210> module<00:00:03.360> is<00:00:03.750> really<00:00:04.110> where<00:00:04.319> the

00:00:04.519 --> 00:00:04.529 
the develop module is really where the

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:07.040 
the develop module is really where the
art<00:00:04.740> and<00:00:05.010> craft<00:00:05.460> of<00:00:05.760> photography<00:00:06.450> inside<00:00:06.960> of

00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:07.050 
art and craft of photography inside of

00:00:07.050 --> 00:00:09.380 
art and craft of photography inside of
Lightroom<00:00:07.470> takes<00:00:07.800> place<00:00:08.130> especially<00:00:08.730> now<00:00:09.240> is

00:00:09.380 --> 00:00:09.390 
Lightroom takes place especially now is

00:00:09.390 --> 00:00:11.030 
Lightroom takes place especially now is
we're<00:00:09.540> captioner<00:00:10.050> images<00:00:10.530> more<00:00:10.769> and<00:00:10.889> more

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:11.040 
we're captioner images more and more

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:13.280 
we're captioner images more and more
frequently<00:00:11.460> in<00:00:11.610> this<00:00:11.730> raw<00:00:11.910> format<00:00:12.450> because<00:00:12.929> as

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:13.290 
frequently in this raw format because as

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:15.650 
frequently in this raw format because as
you<00:00:13.530> know<00:00:13.559> those<00:00:14.339> raw<00:00:14.639> files<00:00:14.969> are<00:00:15.179> just<00:00:15.389> a<00:00:15.480> bit

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:15.660 
you know those raw files are just a bit

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:17.570 
you know those raw files are just a bit
dull<00:00:15.959> and<00:00:16.260> so<00:00:16.770> it's<00:00:16.890> the<00:00:16.980> develop<00:00:17.400> module

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:17.580 
dull and so it's the develop module

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:19.160 
dull and so it's the develop module
where<00:00:18.090> we're<00:00:18.330> going<00:00:18.449> to<00:00:18.539> go<00:00:18.720> in<00:00:18.930> order<00:00:19.109> to

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:19.170 
where we're going to go in order to

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:21.349 
where we're going to go in order to
really<00:00:19.410> bring<00:00:19.859> our<00:00:20.100> images<00:00:20.550> to<00:00:20.699> life<00:00:20.880> and<00:00:21.150> you

00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:21.359 
really bring our images to life and you

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:22.550 
really bring our images to life and you
know<00:00:21.480> what<00:00:21.630> you're<00:00:21.869> going<00:00:22.019> to<00:00:22.080> spend<00:00:22.380> the

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:22.560 
know what you're going to spend the

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:24.919 
know what you're going to spend the
majority<00:00:23.039> of<00:00:23.550> your<00:00:23.789> time<00:00:23.820> in<00:00:24.300> Lightroom

00:00:24.919 --> 00:00:24.929 
majority of your time in Lightroom

00:00:24.929 --> 00:00:26.990 
majority of your time in Lightroom
inside<00:00:25.560> of<00:00:25.679> the<00:00:25.740> develop<00:00:26.039> module<00:00:26.189> working

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:27.000 
inside of the develop module working

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:28.790 
inside of the develop module working
with<00:00:27.269> these<00:00:27.390> panels<00:00:27.810> over<00:00:28.080> here<00:00:28.320> on<00:00:28.500> the<00:00:28.619> right

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:28.800 
with these panels over here on the right

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:30.740 
with these panels over here on the right
now<00:00:29.250> because<00:00:29.640> of<00:00:29.789> this<00:00:29.939> I<00:00:30.150> thought<00:00:30.630> it'd<00:00:30.720> be

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:30.750 
now because of this I thought it'd be

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:32.630 
now because of this I thought it'd be
worthwhile<00:00:31.019> to<00:00:31.289> take<00:00:31.679> a<00:00:31.710> few<00:00:32.040> minutes<00:00:32.279> to<00:00:32.610> talk

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:32.640 
worthwhile to take a few minutes to talk

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:34.910 
worthwhile to take a few minutes to talk
about<00:00:32.970> a<00:00:33.090> few<00:00:33.330> shortcuts<00:00:33.960> that<00:00:34.350> you<00:00:34.530> can<00:00:34.710> use

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:34.920 
about a few shortcuts that you can use

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:37.340 
about a few shortcuts that you can use
in<00:00:35.129> order<00:00:35.640> to<00:00:35.760> navigate<00:00:35.969> in<00:00:36.480> these<00:00:36.719> panels<00:00:37.200> and

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.350 
in order to navigate in these panels and

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:39.560 
in order to navigate in these panels and
in<00:00:37.440> this<00:00:37.590> module<00:00:37.800> so<00:00:38.700> in<00:00:38.790> order<00:00:38.910> to<00:00:39.030> do<00:00:39.210> that<00:00:39.360> I

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.570 
in this module so in order to do that I

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:41.000 
in this module so in order to do that I
want<00:00:39.719> to<00:00:39.840> pull<00:00:39.989> up<00:00:40.110> a<00:00:40.200> slide<00:00:40.500> and<00:00:40.770> on<00:00:40.980> a

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.010 
want to pull up a slide and on a

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:42.799 
want to pull up a slide and on a
highlight<00:00:41.579> a<00:00:41.610> few<00:00:41.760> navigation<00:00:42.570> shortcuts

00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:42.809 
highlight a few navigation shortcuts

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:44.660 
highlight a few navigation shortcuts

one tone curve is too what I want to do

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:12.260 
one tone curve is too what I want to do
is<00:01:10.110> zoom<00:01:10.620> in<00:01:10.860> on<00:01:11.010> this<00:01:11.220> in<00:01:11.490> order<00:01:11.700> to<00:01:11.850> make<00:01:12.030> this

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
even a little bit more clear here now

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:16.010 
even a little bit more clear here now
once<00:01:14.970> we<00:01:15.090> remove<00:01:15.270> all<00:01:15.630> of<00:01:15.810> the<00:01:15.900> other

of contrast alright well so far so good

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:46.580 
of contrast alright well so far so good
yet<00:02:45.209> one<00:02:45.390> of<00:02:45.450> the<00:02:45.540> problems<00:02:46.019> that<00:02:46.140> you<00:02:46.319> may<00:02:46.530> be

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:46.590

00:04:52.970 --> 00:04:52.980 
panel now you know that there are a

00:04:52.980 --> 00:04:54.860

couple<00:04:53.100> of<00:04:53.340> ways<00:04:53.520> to<00:04:53.550> do<00:04:53.850> this<00:04:53.880> right<00:04:54.270> we<00:04:54.480> can

00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:54.870 
couple of ways to do this right we can

00:04:54.870 --> 00:04:56.630 
couple of ways to do this right we can
either<00:04:54.990> scroll<00:04:55.410> with<00:04:55.620> the<00:04:55.710> scroll<00:04:55.980> bar<00:04:56.130> we

either scroll with the scroll bar we

00:04:56.640 --> 00:04:58.820 
either scroll with the scroll bar we
could<00:04:56.790> do<00:04:56.910> that<00:04:56.940> we<00:04:57.600> could<00:04:57.780> hover<00:04:57.990> over<00:04:58.470> one<00:04:58.710> of

00:04:58.820 --> 00:04:58.830 
could do that we could hover over one of

00:04:58.830 --> 00:05:00.710 
could do that we could hover over one of
the<00:04:58.890> panels<00:04:59.250> and<00:04:59.370> then<00:04:59.940> use<00:05:00.090> a<00:05:00.120> scroll<00:05:00.540> wheel

00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:00.720 
the panels and then use a scroll wheel

00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:02.990 
the panels and then use a scroll wheel
if<00:05:00.930> we<00:05:01.020> have<00:05:01.110> a<00:05:01.170> three<00:05:01.410> button<00:05:01.590> mouse<00:05:01.680> or<00:05:02.160> we

00:05:02.990 --> 00:05:03.000 
if we have a three button mouse or we

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:04.700 
if we have a three button mouse or we
could<00:05:03.180> use<00:05:03.390> one<00:05:03.570> of<00:05:03.600> these<00:05:03.750> new<00:05:04.140> shortcuts

00:05:04.700 --> 00:05:04.710
