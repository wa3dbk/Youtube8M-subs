00:00:01.310 --> 00:00:05.750
 hi hello electors how are you 

00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:08.029
 welcome again when I read 

00:00:05.750 --> 00:00:10.430
 I fall in love today we are on the last day of 

00:00:08.029 --> 00:00:12.170
 cycle seven days seven reviews and as already 

00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:14.270
 I had told you from the beginning 

00:00:12.170 --> 00:00:16.430
 to talk about pride and prejudice 

00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:18.699
 from jane austen so let's go to 

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:18.699
 start 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:36.390
 it is a truth that universally 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:38.430
 known that a single man possessor 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:40.290
 of a great fortune he needs a wife 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:41.970
 this is how pride and prejudice begin 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:43.890
 and I think that phrase encompasses 

00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:45.300
 perfectly history in this 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:47.160
 booklet here we will find the 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:50.730
 family history of this family are 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:53.850
 Benet has five daughters who are Jane 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:55.770
 elizabeth lidia and you image this book 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:57.330
 It perfectly reflects the societies 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:01:00.660
 then it means that we also 

00:00:57.330 --> 00:01:02.550
 reflects that need or desire that 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:04.910
 they had women to get a good 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:07.229
 party that practically the woman 

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:09.300
 I just had to worry about that 

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:10.979
 for getting married with a good match we have 

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:12.780
 to a benet lady who really is a 

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:15.240
 character that stresses me a lot 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:16.830
 because it is how it is very stressful 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:19.170
 well there she is worried because she has 

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:21.390
 five daughters and practically has the 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:23.460
 obligation to get a good 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:25.229
 party those five daughters that's why 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:26.790
 When he gets to his ears, Diaz learns 

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:29.850
 that a very young boy is coming 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:31.530
 wealthy to the place decides that she is going 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:33.600
 to do the impossible because some of 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:34.030
 his daughters I conquered this boy and 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:36.310
 I achieved 

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:38.530
 so everything will change from the 

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:40.360
 arrival of Mr. Bean now he does not come 

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:42.729
 it only comes with some friends among 

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:46.090
 them my pig if I'm good is a 

00:01:42.729 --> 00:01:48.400
 Lovely boy smiling very friendly and 

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:49.740
 super friendly while his friend my 

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:51.850
 closed and it's just the opposite 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:54.130
 apparently from those gentlemen to 

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:55.720
 which good with his look nothing more 

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:57.700
 you realize that he thinks that all the 

00:01:55.720 --> 00:02:00.100
 world is inferior or that is what is going to 

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:02.590
 appear when my being darcy and elisabeth 

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:04.930
 know each other a relationship will be generated 

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:06.820
 very uncomfortable very unfriendly is 

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:08.979
 really because both are going to leave 

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:10.479
 led by their prejudices about 

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:12.100
 another as you should already know the 

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:14.410
 main story actually of this 

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:16.959
 book is that of Isabel and mister d'arcy 

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:18.610
 who afterwards in the beginning like them 

00:02:16.959 --> 00:02:20.500
 I say has a very unfriendly relationship 

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:22.420
 and then we're going to see everything in the 

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:24.580
 association of events that are going to go 

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:26.590
 happening that really make it 

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:28.630
 in a very beautiful story they are 

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:31.180
 among my favorite literary partners 

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:33.280
 because they are simply they are 

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:35.080
 great and if you still do not know this 

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:36.910
 history have to know her yes or yes 

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:38.260
 something important to say about the book 

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:40.239
 is that although the writing of the 

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:41.769
 author is masterly and very beautiful 

00:02:40.239 --> 00:02:43.780
 because he has a beautiful feather for 

00:02:41.769 --> 00:02:45.519
 write and to describe the scenarios 

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:47.739
 and apart that they have their humor so 

00:02:45.519 --> 00:02:50.110
 sarcastic that only she has to 

00:02:47.739 --> 00:02:51.940
 reflect this society that really 

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:54.579
 Kill the laughter watching what she 

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:56.410
 account apart from that I have to tell you 

00:02:54.579 --> 00:02:58.600
 and that if you are readers that 

00:02:56.410 --> 00:03:00.519
 they are just starting is if the book 

00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:01.840
 It can be a bit heavy because of the way 

00:03:00.519 --> 00:03:04.329
 in which it is written because this book 

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:06.250
 I was more than 200 years old so 

00:03:04.329 --> 00:03:08.829
 can understand that no is not so 

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:10.359
 easy to read however I'm going to 

00:03:08.829 --> 00:03:12.220
 say something and I want you to have it in 

00:03:10.359 --> 00:03:14.290
 account please and is that if one day 

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:16.180
 they read or have read rugby prejudice and 

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:18.760
 it has seemed very heavy missing from 

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:21.070
 that do not advance leave it there and then 

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:22.269
 resume the later take back the 

00:03:21.070 --> 00:03:24.040
 why the books are worth it 

00:03:22.269 --> 00:03:25.750
 read then there will come a time in 

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:28.060
 their lives in which they will be 

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:30.549
 ready to read this book and they will 

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:32.260
 enjoy so if you found them heavy 

00:03:30.549 --> 00:03:34.060
 it seems very heavy for what they 

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:36.730
 I'm talking ok 

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:40.180
 but please at some point of your 

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:42.430
 Take it and read it and they're going to 

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:43.450
 I enjoy making sure of them completely 

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:45.580
 the adaptations of 'pride and 

00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:48.160
 prejudice 'I have only seen two the 

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:49.569
 first was the 2005 movie that 

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:51.430
 I'm going to give you an image of the 

00:03:49.569 --> 00:03:53.080
 poster surely have seen it because 

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:54.580
 is one of the most recent with the 

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:56.590
 first I saw and of 'pride and 

00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:59.290
 Prejudice 'was with the mental cylinder 

00:03:56.590 --> 00:04:00.910
 dominating is great music the 

00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:02.830
 scenography I love it I love it 

00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:04.690
 just so if you can see it 

00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:06.280
 also out there can help them from 

00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:07.840
 suddenly watch the movie and then read 

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:09.370
 the book who knows and the second 

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:10.870
 performance that I saw was the bbc series 

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:14.319
 that I'm also going to put an image 

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:16.419

00:04:14.319 --> 00:04:18.400

00:04:16.419 --> 00:04:20.470
 so if you like colin filter let's go 

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:22.300
 to see there as my soldiers and really 

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:25.030

00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:28.900

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:32.979
 of has few chapters and it is 

00:04:30.910 --> 00:04:35.050
 practically literal today dialogues 

00:04:32.979 --> 00:04:37.900
 literals of the book so it's super 

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:40.840
 great you can see the enjoy 

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:42.370
 of the movie like the book but if 

00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:46.419

00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:48.160

00:04:46.419 --> 00:04:50.169

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:51.819
 beautiful beautiful that I love him as he already 

00:04:50.169 --> 00:04:53.710
 they can give an account so if they are 

00:04:51.819 --> 00:04:56.259
 looking for classics give it a try 

00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:58.389
 but it's fine if they do not reach 

00:04:56.259 --> 00:04:59.530
 move forward do not worry do not worry 

00:04:58.389 --> 00:05:01.870
