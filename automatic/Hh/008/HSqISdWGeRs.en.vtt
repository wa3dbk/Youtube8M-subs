00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:07.840
 I find today for a 

00:00:05.890 --> 00:00:10.480
 new recipe so again we 

00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:13.630
 will make a revisited vinaigrette 

00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:15.610
 since I like to make salads 

00:00:13.630 --> 00:00:18.340
 composed that are in winter or in summer 

00:00:15.610 --> 00:00:20.619
 and then it's nice to have lots of 

00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:22.300
 full of alternatives and variants of 

00:00:20.619 --> 00:00:24.039
 vinaigrette for power never has 

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:25.690
 weary of these salads so today 

00:00:24.039 --> 00:00:29.380
 we will make a different vinaigrette 

00:00:25.690 --> 00:00:32.100
 with garlic and soy yogurt so 

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:36.370
 to go to soy is 100% soy 

00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:39.970
 with a little bit of parsley 

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:42.969
 need a clove of garlic from an apple and 

00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:45.309
 as usual from now on I 

00:00:42.969 --> 00:00:47.410
 pressed for to put in 

00:00:45.309 --> 00:00:50.290
 a little bit of vinegar if you want 

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:51.610
 livinec of his best sites and if 

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:54.190
 do you prefer what to put juice 

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:56.350
 lemon and add to the end a little 

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:58.329
 little sparkling beer yeast 

00:00:56.350 --> 00:01:00.640
 for for vitamins of group b 

00:00:58.329 --> 00:01:04.809
 if that tempts you so we will start 

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:07.270
 immediately chop the garlic and the 

00:01:04.809 --> 00:01:09.520
 parsley the whole I broke my 

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:13.090
 precious blow I do everything by hand 

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:15.670
 and the ideal is really to chop them 

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:18.549
 together the parsley and there and for for 

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:22.590
 that the taste of ouch dispels well 

00:01:18.549 --> 00:01:22.590
 in the parsley so we go h and all that 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:50.909
 now it's finished vociferous 

00:01:44.939 --> 00:02:06.060
 all but we put it in our salad 

00:01:50.909 --> 00:02:08.849
 and now what they want you 

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:09.509
 put some salt the ideal it is not necessary 

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:12.930
 not put 

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:14.580
 but I know that unfortunately I 

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:16.410
 can not do without salt it's sad 

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:17.519
 but that's the sad reality I eat 

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:18.959
 much less than before 

00:02:17.519 --> 00:02:20.489
 if you can do without that 

00:02:18.959 --> 00:02:21.120
 passed you from cm1 frankly this is it 

00:02:20.489 --> 00:02:23.400
 that there is better to do 

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:29.610
 so then you will take a 

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:32.190
 apple you to peel them or then you 

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:34.819
 to keep skin if you are if you have 

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:34.819
 an organic apple 

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:58.390
 then we'll rape it directly into 

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:58.390
 water it was 

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:16.730
 now we will add a trickle of 

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:18.590
 vinegar up 

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:21.349
 or lemon juice the lemon juice 

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:24.950
 it's better I do not have it on hand and 

00:03:21.349 --> 00:03:27.760
 then we will press to we will have jeans 

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:27.760
 snow has three 

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:57.040
 then we pour 

00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:59.820
 in the vinaigrette we take with a 

00:03:57.040 --> 00:03:59.820
 soup spoon 

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:24.580
 we will put the yogurt or its garden to 

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:34.020
 nantes be a little bit of yeast 

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:34.020
 visor and hop it's gone 

00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:48.030
 geffray see at apple pips 

00:04:53.169 --> 00:05:12.009
 it's a party so it smells great 

00:05:09.370 --> 00:05:13.599
 good it makes me hungry is now in 

00:05:12.009 --> 00:05:14.800
 do you have a dressing I know 

00:05:13.599 --> 00:05:16.449
 that it is not very beautiful I do not think that 

00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:19.599
 I could do pictures that put 

00:05:16.449 --> 00:05:22.629
 worth the video but it's really 

00:05:19.599 --> 00:05:24.610
 super good we tested it yesterday and it's 

00:05:22.629 --> 00:05:27.129
 really excellent so you can 

00:05:24.610 --> 00:05:29.469
 then put the vegetables or fruits 

00:05:27.129 --> 00:05:31.960
 or the fruits and vegetables of your choice 

00:05:29.469 --> 00:05:33.729
 according to what you have in the 

00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:37.719
 fridge depending on what you find 

00:05:33.729 --> 00:05:40.120
 in your supermarkets we this afternoon I 

00:05:37.719 --> 00:05:41.310
 think it's going to be a room 

00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:43.360
 zucchini 

00:05:41.310 --> 00:05:44.919
 I do not know what we will put others 

00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:46.330
 in it I would actually see in 

00:05:44.919 --> 00:05:47.650
 function of which a fridge but in all 

00:05:46.330 --> 00:05:49.210
 case it will be our vinaigrette for this 

00:05:47.650 --> 00:05:51.310
 noon and I would really like to test it 

00:05:49.210 --> 00:05:52.749
 because it's super good it brings a 

00:05:51.310 --> 00:05:56.379
 completely different shot from 

00:05:52.749 --> 00:05:58.569
 usually and it's still tart 

00:05:56.379 --> 00:05:59.860
 really very very tasty so I hope 

00:05:58.569 --> 00:06:01.270
 that you 're going to test it that you have 

00:05:59.860 --> 00:06:04.620
 made you want and I'll see you soon 

00:06:01.270 --> 00:06:04.620
