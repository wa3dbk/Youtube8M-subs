of<00:02:33.520> the<00:02:33.670> others<00:02:33.940> is<00:02:34.180> the<00:02:34.360> wheel<00:02:34.780> wells<00:02:35.050> and<00:02:35.410> the

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:35.830 
of the others is the wheel wells and the

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:39.000 
of the others is the wheel wells and the
wheels<00:02:36.460> are<00:02:36.670> perfectly<00:02:37.180> aligned<00:02:38.010> nothing

wheels are perfectly aligned nothing

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:40.440

annoys<00:02:39.250> me<00:02:39.280> more<00:02:39.700> than<00:02:39.880> having<00:02:40.030> the<00:02:40.270> wheel

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:40.450 
annoys me more than having the wheel

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:43.590

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:43.600 
offset in the wheel well so we usually

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:46.440 
offset in the wheel well so we usually
set<00:02:44.080> these<00:02:44.230> things<00:02:44.560> right<00:02:45.460> up<00:02:45.490> in<00:02:45.790> the<00:02:46.030> dead
