00:00:28.990 --> 00:00:30.900 
about the Centurion hook Centurion hook
was<00:00:29.200> the<00:00:29.380> second<00:00:29.860> hook<00:00:30.070> that<00:00:30.520> I<00:00:30.730> ever

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:30.910 
was the second hook that I ever

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:34.520 
was the second hook that I ever
introduced<00:00:31.480> 14<00:00:32.410> years<00:00:32.649> ago<00:00:32.920> into<00:00:33.700> Carper<00:00:34.210> us

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:34.530 
introduced 14 years ago into Carper us

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:37.290 
introduced 14 years ago into Carper us
and<00:00:35.530> the<00:00:35.620> reason<00:00:35.949> I<00:00:36.129> introduced<00:00:36.910> this<00:00:37.030> hook

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:37.300 
and the reason I introduced this hook

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:40.560 
and the reason I introduced this hook
because<00:00:37.750> it<00:00:38.019> is<00:00:38.230> the<00:00:38.649> the<00:00:39.190> strongest<00:00:39.850> small

00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:40.570 
because it is the the strongest small

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:45.900 
because it is the the strongest small
hook<00:00:40.899> I<00:00:41.170> have<00:00:41.679> ever<00:00:41.949> ever<00:00:42.219> seen<00:00:44.190> in<00:00:45.190> the<00:00:45.429> 14

on fluorocarbon onto this Centurion hook
now<00:02:22.480> the<00:02:23.480> problem<00:02:23.930> is<00:02:24.080> because<00:02:24.380> the

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:25.220 
now the problem is because the

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:28.630

fluorocarbon is stiff this hook does not
easily<00:02:29.060> turn<00:02:29.900> so<00:02:30.860> sometimes<00:02:31.760> it<00:02:32.090> does<00:02:32.720> but<00:02:33.050> a

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:33.350 
easily turn so sometimes it does but a
