00:00:00.949 --> 00:00:08.420
 this is the complete tractor you see 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:21.240
 after which I opened envelope number 3 

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:23.330
 with a few pieces inside to be able to do the 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:27.740
 tank car 

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:30.869
 now let's see for a moment 

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:33.480
 how it proceeds 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:35.070
 just what else to say about the famous ones 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:37.739
 wheels from a tractor 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:41.340
 of course these are free suns 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:43.680
 front or a combination of colors that 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:46.079
 honestly yellow-green borough sometimes I 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:49.410
 I ask because I didn't do everything black 

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:52.530
 example where that remains below though 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:54.329
 in short, green 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:57.930
 and of course these are much more 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:01:00.690
 hard because there is the subject of the engine 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:03.660
 of the mechanism that cultural 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:06.270
 of course the cockpit e 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:07.320
 reversible in the part there are lights 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:09.560
 red 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:12.240
 on one side there are white lights 

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:14.820
 pretty little detail 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:16.470
 with the lid of course as I said 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:19.320
 no one sees anything, there is the famous 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:21.650
 feel here to crush I don't know if 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:26.850
 you have heard the tec 

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:29.220
 ok enough cute and all in all a bit 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:31.439
 read and I must say that I have the 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:34.409
 heaviness because there is the engine and everything 

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:37.049
 what the pieces are small ie not 

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:39.270
 there are mechanisms for which maybe it is 

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:43.110
 assembled one in a single block are 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:45.420
 however, many pieces of 2 from 1 the windows 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:50.280
 a note box is placed maybe a 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:53.250
 piece along the entire ball line 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:56.640
 for strengthened that here apart from the base 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:57.930
 that the two pieces of eight here below 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:01.170
 we say is 

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:04.050
 I don't know, it seems to me leggerina 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:05.760
 leggerina as colaiocco goes well mine 

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:08.250
 impression of course I'm not a 

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:11.820
 happily engineer a passionate 

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:15.209
 now I start with the assembly and the wagon e 

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:18.000
 I think I'll even while we are 

00:02:15.209 --> 00:02:20.490
 envelope number 4 if I find it now 

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:22.470
 education must see if enough 

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:23.850
 easy to do even maybe the two cars e 

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:27.830
 i'm remember pd anyway we see 

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:27.830
 now begin to assemble this
