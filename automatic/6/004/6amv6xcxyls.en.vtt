against India there was a suggestion

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:01.160 
against India there was a suggestion
that<00:00:59.760> the<00:00:59.879> loss<00:01:00.090> was<00:01:00.359> because<00:01:00.690> of<00:01:00.809> reasons

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
that the loss was because of reasons

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:03.500

beyond<00:01:01.590> their<00:01:01.980> control<00:01:02.219> good<00:01:02.879> teams<00:01:03.149> don't<00:01:03.390> do

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
beyond their control good teams don't do

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:04.880

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
that was disappointing and I thought

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:10.130 
that was disappointing and I thought
after<00:01:08.310> that<00:01:08.820> that<00:01:09.030> maybe<00:01:09.299> Bangladesh<00:01:09.900> cricket

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
after that that maybe Bangladesh cricket

after that that maybe Bangladesh cricket
is<00:01:10.229> in<00:01:10.320> trouble<00:01:10.530> it's<00:01:10.770> not<00:01:10.920> willing<00:01:11.189> to<00:01:11.220> look

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
is in trouble it's not willing to look

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:14.060 
is in trouble it's not willing to look
in<00:01:11.640> the<00:01:11.760> mirror<00:01:11.960> but<00:01:12.960> then<00:01:13.470> followed<00:01:13.950> the

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 
in the mirror but then followed the

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:16.100 
in the mirror but then followed the
series<00:01:14.400> against<00:01:14.729> Pakistan<00:01:15.240> and<00:01:15.450> III<00:01:15.750> thought

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
series against Pakistan and III thought

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:18.230

they<00:01:16.229> were<00:01:16.290> excellent<00:01:16.680> to<00:01:17.369> beat<00:01:17.549> Pakistan<00:01:17.820> as

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 
they were excellent to beat Pakistan as

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:19.999 
they were excellent to beat Pakistan as
comprehensively<00:01:19.170> as<00:01:19.380> they<00:01:19.560> did<00:01:19.740> was

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
comprehensively as they did was

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:22.370 
comprehensively as they did was
fantastic<00:01:20.729> but<00:01:21.720> then<00:01:21.840> came<00:01:21.960> the<00:01:22.020> Test<00:01:22.320> match

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:42.570 
move up in much the manner that my

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:44.990 
move up in much the manner that my
madula<00:01:43.020> reacted<00:01:43.549> for<00:01:44.549> a<00:01:44.579> long<00:01:44.729> time<00:01:44.909> we

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000 
madula reacted for a long time we

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:46.219 
madula reacted for a long time we
thought<00:01:45.119> use<00:01:45.299> of<00:01:45.420> bits<00:01:45.570> and<00:01:45.720> pieces<00:01:45.869> player

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:46.229 
thought use of bits and pieces player

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:48.020 
thought use of bits and pieces player
you<00:01:46.710> empowered<00:01:47.130> him<00:01:47.369> gotten<00:01:47.670> too<00:01:47.759> bad<00:01:47.880> at

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
you empowered him gotten too bad at

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:49.130 
you empowered him gotten too bad at
number<00:01:48.270> four<00:01:48.450> you<00:01:48.540> discovered<00:01:48.930> a<00:01:48.960> completely

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.140 
number four you discovered a completely

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:50.719 
number four you discovered a completely
new<00:01:49.619> player<00:01:49.860> was<00:01:50.009> waiting<00:01:50.340> to<00:01:50.430> be<00:01:50.520> discovered

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:50.729 
new player was waiting to be discovered

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:52.280 
new player was waiting to be discovered
so<00:01:50.970> maybe<00:01:51.240> some<00:01:51.479> of<00:01:51.570> these<00:01:51.689> players<00:01:52.020> are<00:01:52.170> like

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:52.290 
so maybe some of these players are like

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:52.969 
so maybe some of these players are like
that<00:01:52.500> as<00:01:52.619> well

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979 
that as well

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:54.679 
that as well
but<00:01:53.310> the<00:01:53.430> reason<00:01:53.790> I'm<00:01:53.939> more<00:01:54.180> excited<00:01:54.479> about

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:54.689 
but the reason I'm more excited about

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:56.690 
but the reason I'm more excited about

00:01:59.270 --> 00:01:59.280 
Tuscan and rouble teams that have good

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:02.899 
Tuscan and rouble teams that have good
fast<00:01:59.610> bowlers<00:02:00.090> are<00:02:00.360> able<00:02:01.259> to<00:02:01.380> compete<00:02:01.799> in<00:02:02.070> in

fast bowlers are able to compete in in

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:05.690 
fast bowlers are able to compete in in
much<00:02:03.420> more<00:02:03.630> difficult<00:02:04.170> environments<00:02:04.860> so<00:02:05.310> that

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:05.700 
much more difficult environments so that

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:07.880 
much more difficult environments so that
is<00:02:05.850> what<00:02:06.030> I'm<00:02:06.149> looking<00:02:06.420> forward<00:02:06.750> to<00:02:06.780> to<00:02:07.649> see<00:02:07.799> if

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:07.890 
is what I'm looking forward to to see if

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:08.960 
is what I'm looking forward to to see if
