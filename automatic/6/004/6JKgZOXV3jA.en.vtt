with<00:00:59.250> most<00:00:59.670> of<00:00:59.789> the<00:00:59.850> sandwiches<00:01:00.300> at<00:01:00.600> jolly

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
with most of the sandwiches at jolly

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:03.080 
with most of the sandwiches at jolly
holiday<00:01:01.050> is<00:01:01.410> that<00:01:01.680> they'll<00:01:02.399> make<00:01:02.609> them<00:01:02.850> and

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.090 
holiday is that they'll make them and

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:04.160 
holiday is that they'll make them and
then<00:01:03.210> they'll<00:01:03.359> kind<00:01:03.480> of<00:01:03.600> sit<00:01:03.780> under<00:01:03.989> heat

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
then they'll kind of sit under heat

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:07.100 
then they'll kind of sit under heat
lamps<00:01:04.199> for<00:01:04.920> multiple<00:01:05.760> hours<00:01:05.820> at<00:01:06.119> a<00:01:06.150> time<00:01:06.360> but

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
lamps for multiple hours at a time but

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:08.899 
lamps for multiple hours at a time but
overall<00:01:07.500> it's<00:01:07.740> worth<00:01:07.890> trying<00:01:08.220> it's<00:01:08.520> only<00:01:08.670> nine

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909 
overall it's worth trying it's only nine

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:10.280 
overall it's worth trying it's only nine
dollars<00:01:09.210> and<00:01:09.360> sixty-nine<00:01:09.750> cents<00:01:10.020> so<00:01:10.170> you're

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
dollars and sixty-nine cents so you're

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:11.929 
dollars and sixty-nine cents so you're
not<00:01:10.409> really<00:01:10.530> losing<00:01:10.920> out<00:01:11.010> on<00:01:11.040> much<00:01:11.369> if<00:01:11.610> you<00:01:11.729> do

the seasonal cupcakes these are 499
which<00:01:27.570> is<00:01:27.720> just<00:01:27.900> outrageously<00:01:28.530> priced<00:01:28.710> in<00:01:29.009> my

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
which is just outrageously priced in my

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:32.090 
which is just outrageously priced in my
opinion<00:01:29.689> cupcake<00:01:30.689> is<00:01:30.840> good<00:01:31.049> but<00:01:31.619> in<00:01:31.920> typical

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100
