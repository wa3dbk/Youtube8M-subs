00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:31.050 
which is I really appreciate it even

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:33.319

having<00:00:31.380> it<00:00:31.470> on<00:00:31.800> it<00:00:32.070> was<00:00:32.160> just<00:00:32.369> kind<00:00:32.579> of<00:00:32.640> soft<00:00:33.030> on

00:00:33.319 --> 00:00:33.329 
having it on it was just kind of soft on

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:35.450 
having it on it was just kind of soft on
my<00:00:33.480> face<00:00:33.809> so<00:00:34.079> it<00:00:34.590> wasn't<00:00:34.950> that<00:00:35.010> uncomfortable

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:35.460 
my face so it wasn't that uncomfortable

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:38.030 
my face so it wasn't that uncomfortable
it's<00:00:36.000> still<00:00:36.180> a<00:00:36.210> 5.7<00:00:36.930> inch<00:00:37.170> screen<00:00:37.559> but<00:00:37.590> now

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.040 
it's still a 5.7 inch screen but now

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:40.280 
it's still a 5.7 inch screen but now
instead<00:00:38.460> of<00:00:38.520> being<00:00:38.610> LCD<00:00:39.180> it's<00:00:39.329> an<00:00:39.450> OLED<00:00:39.899> screen

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:40.290 
instead of being LCD it's an OLED screen

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:43.280 
instead of being LCD it's an OLED screen
I<00:00:40.590> would<00:00:41.129> say<00:00:41.250> the<00:00:41.370> graphics<00:00:41.960> they're<00:00:42.960> running

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.290 
I would say the graphics they're running

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:45.290 
I would say the graphics they're running
at<00:00:43.379> 1080p<00:00:43.800> but<00:00:44.190> the<00:00:44.280> graphics<00:00:44.640> aren't<00:00:44.879> that

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300 
at 1080p but the graphics aren't that

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:48.139 
at 1080p but the graphics aren't that
impressive<00:00:45.770> they're<00:00:46.770> a<00:00:47.129> little<00:00:47.340> bit<00:00:47.520> Jaggi

00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:48.149 
impressive they're a little bit Jaggi

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:50.990 
impressive they're a little bit Jaggi
and<00:00:48.329> look<00:00:48.480> maybe<00:00:49.110> not<00:00:49.320> PlayStation<00:00:50.010> 4<00:00:50.460> quality

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
and look maybe not PlayStation 4 quality

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.479 
and look maybe not PlayStation 4 quality
maybe<00:00:51.149> PlayStation<00:00:51.809> 3<00:00:52.260> quality<00:00:52.800> this<00:00:53.129> is<00:00:53.190> my

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:53.489 
maybe PlayStation 3 quality this is my

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:56.150 
maybe PlayStation 3 quality this is my
opinion<00:00:53.789> the<00:00:54.780> demos<00:00:55.140> that<00:00:55.289> I<00:00:55.379> saw<00:00:55.620> saw<00:00:55.860> two

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.160 
opinion the demos that I saw saw two

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:58.430 
opinion the demos that I saw saw two
demos<00:00:56.550> one<00:00:57.270> of<00:00:57.360> them<00:00:57.480> you<00:00:57.989> know<00:00:58.079> you're<00:00:58.320> just

what<00:01:16.439> VR<00:01:16.830> is<00:01:17.100> the<00:01:17.790> one<00:01:17.939> that<00:01:18.030> I<00:01:18.150> really<00:01:18.390> like

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659 
what VR is the one that I really like

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:20.960 
what VR is the one that I really like
however<00:01:18.900> was<00:01:19.409> a<00:01:19.710> demo<00:01:19.979> called<00:01:20.280> London<00:01:20.700> heist

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:20.970 
however was a demo called London heist

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:22.940 
however was a demo called London heist
so<00:01:21.240> basically<00:01:21.659> you<00:01:21.840> start<00:01:22.049> off<00:01:22.320> you're<00:01:22.590> in

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
so basically you start off you're in

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:24.649 
so basically you start off you're in
this<00:01:23.460> kind<00:01:23.729> of<00:01:23.790> warehouse<00:01:24.060> you're<00:01:24.509> being

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659 
this kind of warehouse you're being

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:26.630 
this kind of warehouse you're being
interrogated<00:01:25.170> by<00:01:25.290> this<00:01:25.439> really<00:01:25.770> tough<00:01:26.040> guy<00:01:26.280> in

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 
interrogated by this really tough guy in

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:28.819 
interrogated by this really tough guy in
a<00:01:26.729> in<00:01:26.909> a<00:01:27.270> tank<00:01:27.570> top<00:01:27.750> he's<00:01:28.229> about<00:01:28.409> to<00:01:28.590> probably

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:28.829 
a in a tank top he's about to probably

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:30.530 
a in a tank top he's about to probably
do<00:01:28.979> some<00:01:29.220> really<00:01:29.430> bad<00:01:29.670> stuff<00:01:30.030> to<00:01:30.210> you<00:01:30.329> and

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.540 
do some really bad stuff to you and

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:32.300 
do some really bad stuff to you and
you're<00:01:30.960> using<00:01:31.290> the<00:01:31.380> move<00:01:31.590> controller<00:01:32.040> so<00:01:32.189> you

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310 
you're using the move controller so you

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:33.920 
you're using the move controller so you
have<00:01:32.430> a<00:01:32.460> move<00:01:32.850> controller<00:01:33.210> in<00:01:33.329> each<00:01:33.479> hand<00:01:33.750> you

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:33.930 
have a move controller in each hand you

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:36.469 
have a move controller in each hand you
have<00:01:34.079> a<00:01:34.110> trigger<00:01:34.500> for<00:01:34.799> each<00:01:34.920> hand<00:01:35.220> and<00:01:35.520> it<00:01:36.329> was

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479 
have a trigger for each hand and it was

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:37.700 
have a trigger for each hand and it was
actually<00:01:36.810> really<00:01:36.960> immersive<00:01:37.470> there<00:01:37.560> was<00:01:37.650> a

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710 
actually really immersive there was a
