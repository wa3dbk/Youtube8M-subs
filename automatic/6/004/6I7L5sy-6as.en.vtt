00:00:01.130 --> 00:00:07.190
 hello very good everyone today I bring you a 

00:00:03.830 --> 00:00:09.290
 video of being here with me how to do 

00:00:07.190 --> 00:00:12.850
 I currently use my profile called 

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:15.920
 brian because even in exchange for the name 

00:00:12.850 --> 00:00:19.550
 they continue in this channel but I have a view 

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:22.340
 structural and good today I want you 

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:24.860
 teach a fairly simple strategy 

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:27.530
 for people like me who do not know 

00:00:24.860 --> 00:00:30.090
 which multitrack to start called 

00:00:27.530 --> 00:00:34.260
 the sixteen strategy 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:36.250
 impure that I think it is at 60 in 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:39.640
 a pool 

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:41.040
 well we started first today by 

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:44.440
 chance playing a game 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:47.410
 randomly I got myself with a terÃ¡n 

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:50.080
 called liz and very habitual in being 

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:52.629
 here to greet the entity for a game 

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:55.510
 but the truth is that I have no time 

00:00:52.629 --> 00:00:59.830
 for that I prefer to focus on everything 

00:00:55.510 --> 00:01:03.340
 goal but good as you see I do not do 

00:00:59.830 --> 00:01:05.800
 drones because the game tried to get 

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:09.660
 as soon as possible to 200 supplies 

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:09.660
 to be able to do physics first 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:15.270
 that serves the being to create prosperity 

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:18.540
 a very important thing that they have to 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:20.820
 keep in mind is the scouteo since 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:22.590
 the maps like this one there are several points 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:26.220
 where the enemy can leave but 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:29.910
 normally he will always come out in front of 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:31.410
 your base will know if you leave them 

00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:34.560
 example like me right now with a drone 

00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:36.450
 where is your enemy and for me 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:38.280
 ruiz strategy that is to take games 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:40.259
 very very rare of gain I have to 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:42.810
 know if I know where they are not 

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:46.830
 I'm going to lose time and my 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:49.050
 enemy closes the ramp before living 

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:50.520
 well here you can see how I have the 

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:53.370
 Production reserve about to 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:54.540
 finish I'll just have four working 

00:01:53.370 --> 00:01:57.150
 drones 

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:59.460
 and what you try to do is save two 

00:01:57.150 --> 00:02:01.290
 larvae in my hatcheries or three do 

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:03.990
 possible so that just when it 

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:06.159
 finished in my booking this race 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:10.289
 transform practices 

00:02:06.159 --> 00:02:10.289
 you can see it there 

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:20.450
 but then after that 

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:22.550
 I had left my base sending the sayings 

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:25.069
 so to yours 

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:28.310
 I thought there that I had seen in the 

00:02:25.069 --> 00:02:30.200
 next days something very smart up 

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:31.760
 face 

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:34.430
 enemies when you arrive before 

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:35.810
 construction that with your carts well not 

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:37.160
 build and what it is 

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:39.680
 building do not count that you can 

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:43.250
 get to kill but as we see here it 

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:44.569
 realize that decided to go around 

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:47.590
 so that I do not keep the drone and 

00:02:44.569 --> 00:02:47.590
 have him busy 

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:53.890
 as you can see they have arrived I will 

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:56.380
 attack the drone 

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:57.940
 and drone previously I do not know anyone but 

00:02:56.380 --> 00:03:00.610
 I decide instead of going back because 

00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:02.560
 flies I decide to put you create a 

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:05.950
 refinery know that it costs me enough 

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:09.940
 little 25 mineral and so I have a 

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:11.650
 vision of the long enemy camp 

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:14.740
 but in this game you can already see that 

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:20.140
 they are practically very dead there what 

00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:23.230
 You can see killed with 4 servings how many 6 

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:25.540
 works there you can see the capital 

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:26.860
 wanting to do it and they are not so bad 

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:29.260
 how it looks 

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:32.550
 good here and the game ends 

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:37.060
 true that pretty fast I'm up to date 

00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:40.240
 of copper then that for now is 

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:42.640
 all pretty country and you're all but what 

00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:45.420
 help 

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:45.420
 until next time 

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:49.190
 love
