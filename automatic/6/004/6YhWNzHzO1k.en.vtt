00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.480
 good to all my name is rami and 

00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:05.430
 welcome to another video this time 

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:08.069
 I bring a 9 of easter west of in the 

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:09.929
 multiplayer map of ruins say that 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:11.849
 the best this easter egg as it is not 

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:13.950
 is complete but what you are going to see 

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:17.279
 obviously yes it is an easter egg 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:19.410
 for everything that needs to be done and such good 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:21.240
 what we have to do is press a 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:23.490
 button combination the buttons that 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:25.859
 There are scattered around the map to activate 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:28.080
 the bridge there we see a yellow thing 

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:30.029
 bouncing well that's a clown it's worth 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:32.850
 It's small but when we make the egg 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:34.680
 of Easter will be huge then we will 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:36.870
 do the button combination this is 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:39.719
 the first one who is in the temple 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:41.660
 then we have to press the one that is 

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:45.020
 in the caves 

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:47.320
 then the one who is in the booth then 

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:51.010
 we go back to the caves 

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:53.350
 then who is in the waterfall then to 

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:56.980
 the sentry box 

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:59.230
 and finally to the caves after pressing 

00:00:56.980 --> 00:01:01.809
 this button will already be made the game of 

00:00:59.230 --> 00:01:03.820
 easter the giant clown will come out but 

00:01:01.809 --> 00:01:06.190
 before pressing it I would like to say of 

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:08.740
 that you do not need to shoot any 

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:11.259
 helmet that is somewhere in the map 

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:13.420
 Well, for example, what are you going to see there? 

00:01:11.259 --> 00:01:15.130
 so you do not have to shoot him 

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:17.700
 activate this easter egg so 

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:17.700
 let's give it 

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:34.440
 and well there you just see how I am 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:37.170
 giant this is the easter egg of 

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:39.360
 ruins map is not known if there is something else 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:42.180
 I sincerely believe that it can be of 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:44.490
 that there is something more basically for the 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:46.410
 helmets that have scattered around the map and 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:48.570
 besides that the clown is not yet gone 

00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:51.870
 but there are still in the waterfalls there 

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:54.750
 you can see his huge head and also 

00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:57.780
 say that we tried to shoot him from 

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:59.640
 all with grenades with sniper with 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:00.930
 throw or even with boomers 

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:04.950
 but there is a kind of invisible wall 

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:07.830
 or something that does not allow us to 

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:09.990
 lets give it but well I do not know if there will be 

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:13.290
 something else finally is simply 

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:16.110
 show you the following with the boom is 

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:19.530
 we just take it because they come out like 

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:20.880
 flowers some flowers and I do not know if 

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:23.610
 better with the volume you have to do something 

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:26.460
 honestly I do not know and then because 

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:29.370
 last when we make a gesture is a 

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:32.420
 person or we kill it because sometimes it comes out 

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:32.420
 a voice to laughs 

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:39.750
 in this case they were like a voice 

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:42.240
 saying how pretty much I do not know if 

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:44.340
 you have listened but good basically 

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:45.810
 this is the easter egg I do not know if it's 

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:47.670
 full one hundred percent but this 

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:49.020
 obviously it's an easter egg so 

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:53.120
 well, nothing, I hope that I have 

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:53.120
 liked and see you in another video
