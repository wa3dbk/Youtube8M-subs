00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:33.380 
do come out but just be patient with it
don't<00:02:31.320> rush<00:02:31.620> it<00:02:31.830> and<00:02:31.890> realize<00:02:32.250> it's<00:02:33.150> going<00:02:33.330> to

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:33.390 
don't rush it and realize it's going to

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:36.610 
don't rush it and realize it's going to
give<00:02:33.570> you<00:02:33.690> a<00:02:33.720> little<00:02:33.780> bit<00:02:34.140> of<00:02:34.230> a<00:02:34.320> problem

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:36.620 

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:39.380 

that's<00:02:37.620> why<00:02:37.890> I<00:02:37.920> use<00:02:37.950> the<00:02:38.310> screwdriver<00:02:38.610> just<00:02:39.240> to

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:39.390 
that's why I use the screwdriver just to

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:42.560 
that's why I use the screwdriver just to
push<00:02:39.600> that<00:02:39.780> clamp<00:02:40.140> down<00:02:40.580> it<00:02:41.580> should<00:02:41.610> slide<00:02:42.330> off

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:42.570 
push that clamp down it should slide off

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:48.920 
push that clamp down it should slide off
really<00:02:42.840> easy<00:02:43.520> so<00:02:45.680> after<00:02:46.680> you<00:02:47.040> remove<00:02:47.970> that<00:02:48.000> red

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:48.930 
really easy so after you remove that red

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:55.010 
really easy so after you remove that red

in at all before you put on the new CPS

00:04:01.519 --> 00:04:04.039 
in at all before you put on the new CPS
that's<00:04:02.519> looking<00:04:02.940> on<00:04:03.090> the<00:04:03.120> inside<00:04:03.360> and<00:04:03.900> that's

00:04:04.039 --> 00:04:04.049 
that's looking on the inside and that's

00:04:04.049 --> 00:04:06.289 
that's looking on the inside and that's
where<00:04:04.290> you<00:04:04.380> look<00:04:04.590> for<00:04:04.620> the<00:04:04.860> where<00:04:05.160> there<00:04:06.150> isn't

00:04:06.289 --> 00:04:06.299 
where you look for the where there isn't

00:04:06.299 --> 00:04:09.050 
where you look for the where there isn't
very<00:04:06.480> much<00:04:06.780> we're<00:04:07.110> on<00:04:07.290> this<00:04:07.470> one<00:04:07.769> so<00:04:08.760> there's

00:04:09.050 --> 00:04:09.060 
very much we're on this one so there's

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:11.150 
very much we're on this one so there's
not<00:04:09.180> much<00:04:09.480> movement<00:04:09.750> in<00:04:10.110> that<00:04:10.140> cam<00:04:10.560> not<00:04:10.950> much

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:11.160 
not much movement in that cam not much

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:17.630 
not much movement in that cam not much
to<00:04:11.370> worry<00:04:11.579> about<00:04:14.810> if<00:04:15.810> you<00:04:16.169> happen<00:04:17.100> to<00:04:17.459> catch

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:17.640 
to worry about if you happen to catch

the<00:04:18.560> video<00:04:19.560> I<00:04:19.590> made<00:04:19.950> on<00:04:20.250> these<00:04:20.700> wobble

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:21.320 
the video I made on these wobble

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:24.920 
the video I made on these wobble
extensions<00:04:22.940> that's<00:04:23.940> what<00:04:24.120> I<00:04:24.150> used<00:04:24.450> here<00:04:24.750> they

00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:24.930 
extensions that's what I used here they

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:27.150 
extensions that's what I used here they
helped<00:04:25.140> me<00:04:25.289> a<00:04:25.320> lot<00:04:25.560> this<00:04:26.520> here<00:04:26.880> is

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:27.160 
helped me a lot this here is

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:28.830 
helped me a lot this here is
different<00:04:27.400> than<00:04:27.460> your<00:04:27.730> normal<00:04:27.840> extension

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:28.840 
different than your normal extension

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:31.620 
different than your normal extension
because<00:04:29.050> these<00:04:29.950> corners<00:04:30.520> are<00:04:30.700> rounded<00:04:30.730> and<00:04:31.420> it

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:31.630 
because these corners are rounded and it

00:04:31.630 --> 00:04:35.850 
because these corners are rounded and it
gives<00:04:32.020> you<00:04:32.290> about<00:04:33.070> 15<00:04:33.610> degrees<00:04:33.790> of<00:04:34.330> wobble<00:04:34.860> so

00:04:35.850 --> 00:04:35.860 
gives you about 15 degrees of wobble so

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:40.320 
gives you about 15 degrees of wobble so
it's<00:04:36.400> it<00:04:37.060> isn't<00:04:37.270> a<00:04:37.600> dead-on<00:04:39.060> push<00:04:40.060> with<00:04:40.300> the

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:40.330 
it's it isn't a dead-on push with the

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:44.280 
it's it isn't a dead-on push with the
socket<00:04:40.920> it's<00:04:41.920> hard<00:04:42.190> to<00:04:42.400> get<00:04:42.580> out<00:04:42.820> so<00:04:43.390> I<00:04:43.660> needed

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:44.290 
socket it's hard to get out so I needed

00:04:44.290 --> 00:04:46.350 
socket it's hard to get out so I needed
a<00:04:44.380> little<00:04:44.620> bit<00:04:44.890> of<00:04:44.920> an<00:04:45.100> angle<00:04:45.280> on<00:04:45.610> the<00:04:45.790> socket

00:04:46.350 --> 00:04:46.360 
a little bit of an angle on the socket

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:49.770 
a little bit of an angle on the socket
just<00:04:47.230> to<00:04:47.380> make<00:04:47.560> life<00:04:47.830> easier<00:04:48.400> that<00:04:49.060> little<00:04:49.270> 15

00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:49.780 
just to make life easier that little 15

00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:52.710 
just to make life easier that little 15
degrees<00:04:50.200> gave<00:04:50.620> me<00:04:50.800> what<00:04:50.980> I<00:04:51.010> needed<00:04:51.360> to<00:04:52.360> put<00:04:52.600> it

00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:52.720 
degrees gave me what I needed to put it

00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:57.630 
degrees gave me what I needed to put it
on<00:04:52.900> and<00:04:53.170> it<00:04:53.800> helped<00:04:55.470> get<00:04:56.470> that<00:04:56.680> the<00:04:57.310> bottom

00:04:57.630 --> 00:04:57.640 
on and it helped get that the bottom

00:04:57.640 --> 00:05:00.810 
on and it helped get that the bottom
bolt<00:04:57.880> in<00:04:58.150> on<00:04:58.330> that<00:04:58.480> one<00:04:58.660> corner<00:04:59.170> because<00:04:59.820> like

00:05:00.810 --> 00:05:00.820 
bolt in on that one corner because like

00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:02.850 
bolt in on that one corner because like
I<00:05:00.970> say<00:05:01.180> of<00:05:01.420> needing<00:05:02.140> that<00:05:02.290> little<00:05:02.620> bit<00:05:02.740> of

00:05:02.850 --> 00:05:02.860 
I say of needing that little bit of

00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:07.560 
I say of needing that little bit of
curve<00:05:03.160> on<00:05:03.400> the<00:05:03.610> socket<00:05:04.890> these<00:05:06.570> wobble

00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:07.570 
curve on the socket these wobble

00:05:07.570 --> 00:05:10.980 
curve on the socket these wobble
extensions<00:05:08.260> give<00:05:09.010> you<00:05:09.130> that<00:05:09.370> and<00:05:09.750> as<00:05:10.750> I<00:05:10.930> said

00:05:10.980 --> 00:05:10.990 
extensions give you that and as I said

00:05:10.990 --> 00:05:13.140 
extensions give you that and as I said
in<00:05:11.350> my<00:05:11.380> previous<00:05:11.740> video<00:05:12.130> when<00:05:12.550> I<00:05:12.580> talked<00:05:12.970> about

00:05:13.140 --> 00:05:13.150 
in my previous video when I talked about

00:05:13.150 --> 00:05:15.860 
in my previous video when I talked about
them<00:05:13.570> you<00:05:14.290> can<00:05:14.470> even<00:05:14.590> put<00:05:14.710> two<00:05:15.100> together<00:05:15.250> and

00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:15.870 
them you can even put two together and

00:05:15.870 --> 00:05:22.200 
them you can even put two together and
create<00:05:16.870> more<00:05:17.970> maneuverability<00:05:20.970> we<00:05:21.970> have

00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:22.210 
create more maneuverability we have

00:05:22.210 --> 00:05:28.560 
create more maneuverability we have
things<00:05:22.630> back<00:05:23.050> together<00:05:23.350> now<00:05:24.360> the<00:05:27.000> PVC<00:05:28.000> hoses

00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:28.570 
things back together now the PVC hoses

00:05:28.570 --> 00:05:30.920 
things back together now the PVC hoses
on<00:05:28.750> the<00:05:29.260> electrical<00:05:29.740> connectors<00:05:30.250> are<00:05:30.520> back

00:05:30.920 --> 00:05:30.930 
on the electrical connectors are back

00:05:30.930 --> 00:05:36.120 
on the electrical connectors are back
done<00:05:31.930> up<00:05:32.140> and<00:05:33.360> the<00:05:34.360> air<00:05:34.450> cleaner<00:05:34.660> hose<00:05:35.130> the

00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:36.130 
done up and the air cleaner hose the

00:05:36.130 --> 00:05:39.720 
done up and the air cleaner hose the
bolts<00:05:36.490> are<00:05:36.640> tight<00:05:37.440> I've<00:05:38.440> gone<00:05:38.740> and<00:05:39.130> it<00:05:39.280> started

00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:39.730 
bolts are tight I've gone and it started

00:05:39.730 --> 00:05:43.560 
bolts are tight I've gone and it started
up<00:05:40.590> after<00:05:41.590> I<00:05:41.620> put<00:05:41.860> the<00:05:41.980> battery<00:05:42.430> in<00:05:42.460> you<00:05:43.330> see<00:05:43.540> I

00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:43.570 
up after I put the battery in you see I

00:05:43.570 --> 00:05:45.480 
up after I put the battery in you see I
just<00:05:43.810> need<00:05:43.990> to<00:05:44.020> put<00:05:44.380> the<00:05:44.500> battery<00:05:44.919> in<00:05:44.950> now<00:05:45.220> and

00:05:45.480 --> 00:05:45.490 
just need to put the battery in now and

00:05:45.490 --> 00:05:49.440 
just need to put the battery in now and
it's<00:05:46.300> running<00:05:46.540> and<00:05:46.960> work<00:05:47.830> great<00:05:48.210> very<00:05:49.210> easy

00:06:00.750 --> 00:06:00.760 
pretty easy job to fix the p.o 340 code

00:06:00.760 --> 00:06:03.840 
pretty easy job to fix the p.o 340 code
on<00:06:01.030> a<00:06:01.060> motor<00:06:01.390> it's<00:06:01.600> a<00:06:01.720> generic<00:06:02.080> code<00:06:02.440> so<00:06:02.800> a<00:06:03.040> lot

00:06:03.840 --> 00:06:03.850 
on a motor it's a generic code so a lot

00:06:03.850 --> 00:06:06.659 
on a motor it's a generic code so a lot
of<00:06:03.880> motors<00:06:04.300> will<00:06:05.140> bring<00:06:05.410> up<00:06:05.590> that<00:06:05.800> that<00:06:06.400> very

00:06:06.659 --> 00:06:06.669 
of motors will bring up that that very

00:06:06.669 --> 00:06:10.440 
of motors will bring up that that very
code<00:06:07.290> you<00:06:08.290> find<00:06:08.680> your<00:06:09.100> crankshaft<00:06:09.640> position

00:06:10.440 --> 00:06:10.450 
code you find your crankshaft position

00:06:10.450 --> 00:06:15.900 
code you find your crankshaft position
sensor<00:06:10.480> on<00:06:11.020> your<00:06:11.230> motor<00:06:11.470> and<00:06:14.550> it'll<00:06:15.550> be<00:06:15.730> about

00:06:15.900 --> 00:06:15.910 
sensor on your motor and it'll be about

00:06:15.910 --> 00:06:18.680 
sensor on your motor and it'll be about
the<00:06:16.120> same<00:06:16.300> steps<00:06:16.720> as<00:06:16.900> this<00:06:17.110> just<00:06:17.430> unbolting<00:06:18.430> it

00:06:18.680 --> 00:06:18.690 
the same steps as this just unbolting it

00:06:18.690 --> 00:06:21.960 
the same steps as this just unbolting it
bolting<00:06:19.690> your<00:06:19.870> other<00:06:20.020> one<00:06:20.260> in<00:06:20.500> and<00:06:20.850> you're<00:06:21.850> on

00:06:21.960 --> 00:06:21.970 
bolting your other one in and you're on

00:06:21.970 --> 00:06:23.909 
bolting your other one in and you're on
your<00:06:22.000> way<00:06:22.210> and<00:06:22.570> saved<00:06:22.840> yourself<00:06:23.050> a<00:06:23.500> few

00:06:23.909 --> 00:06:23.919 
your way and saved yourself a few

00:06:23.919 --> 00:06:27.210 
your way and saved yourself a few
