or<00:02:23.450> you<00:02:23.750> know<00:02:23.870> it<00:02:23.930> it's<00:02:24.080> it's<00:02:24.380> a<00:02:24.440> little<00:02:24.560> bit

00:02:24.729 --> 00:02:24.739 
or you know it it's it's a little bit

00:02:24.739 --> 00:02:26.800 
or you know it it's it's a little bit
more<00:02:24.890> expensive<00:02:25.220> than<00:02:25.400> body<00:02:25.640> filler<00:02:25.970> but<00:02:26.690> it

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:26.810 
more expensive than body filler but it

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:29.350 
more expensive than body filler but it
really<00:02:26.989> helps<00:02:27.440> eliminate<00:02:28.040> any<00:02:28.519> pinholes<00:02:29.060> and

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:29.360 
really helps eliminate any pinholes and

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:32.170 
really helps eliminate any pinholes and
it<00:02:30.320> doesn't<00:02:30.620> really<00:02:30.709> have<00:02:30.829> much<00:02:30.980> shrinkage<00:02:31.760> so

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:32.180 
it doesn't really have much shrinkage so

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:34.900 
it doesn't really have much shrinkage so
you<00:02:32.480> know<00:02:32.570> helps

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:34.910 

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:40.880 

I<00:02:36.560> recommend<00:02:37.560> using<00:02:37.770> it<00:02:39.200> some<00:02:40.200> shops<00:02:40.440> may<00:02:40.680> not
