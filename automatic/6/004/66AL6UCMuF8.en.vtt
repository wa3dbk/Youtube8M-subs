00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:08.889 
it in a secure location so you don't
lose<00:02:08.399> it

00:02:08.889 --> 00:02:08.899 
lose it

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:13.120

the<00:02:09.899> next<00:02:10.200> step<00:02:10.440> is<00:02:10.649> to<00:02:11.220> go<00:02:11.400> into<00:02:11.430> your<00:02:11.760> C<00:02:12.000> Drive

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:13.130 
the next step is to go into your C Drive

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:19.170 
the next step is to go into your C Drive
and<00:02:13.630> create<00:02:14.630> a<00:02:14.660> directory<00:02:15.170> called<00:02:15.560> NV<00:02:16.190> flash

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:19.180 

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:21.550 

it's<00:02:20.180> not<00:02:20.330> critical<00:02:20.630> to<00:02:20.840> call<00:02:21.080> it<00:02:21.170> NV<00:02:21.380> flash

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:21.560 
it's not critical to call it NV flash

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:23.020 
it's not critical to call it NV flash
you<00:02:21.740> can<00:02:21.770> call<00:02:21.980> it<00:02:22.070> whatever<00:02:22.220> you<00:02:22.400> want<00:02:22.550> I'm

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:23.030 
you can call it whatever you want I'm

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:24.340 
you can call it whatever you want I'm
just<00:02:23.210> going<00:02:23.480> to<00:02:23.540> name<00:02:23.660> it<00:02:23.720> NV<00:02:24.020> flash<00:02:24.200> because

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:24.350 
just going to name it NV flash because

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:29.080 
just going to name it NV flash because
it's<00:02:24.560> easy<00:02:24.770> and<00:02:27.280> you'll<00:02:28.280> open<00:02:28.430> up<00:02:28.640> your<00:02:28.760> NV

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:29.090 
it's easy and you'll open up your NV

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:30.520 
it's easy and you'll open up your NV

Exe file and the two NV flash 32 and 64
Syst<00:02:38.840> files<00:02:39.970> put<00:02:40.970> those<00:02:41.120> in<00:02:41.450> your<00:02:41.480> NV<00:02:41.930> flash

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:42.140 
Syst files put those in your NV flash

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:44.500 
Syst files put those in your NV flash
directory<00:02:42.650> and<00:02:42.800> then<00:02:43.640> you<00:02:43.760> want<00:02:43.940> to<00:02:43.970> grab<00:02:44.210> the

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:44.510 
directory and then you want to grab the

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:49.240 
directory and then you want to grab the
hydro<00:02:45.020> copper<00:02:45.500> ROM<00:02:46.460> file<00:02:46.790> and<00:02:47.950> drop<00:02:48.950> that<00:02:49.100> in

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:49.250 
hydro copper ROM file and drop that in

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:50.350 
hydro copper ROM file and drop that in
there<00:02:49.400> as<00:02:49.490> well<00:02:49.700> so<00:02:50.000> you're<00:02:50.090> going<00:02:50.210> to<00:02:50.270> have

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:50.360 
there as well so you're going to have

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:52.090 
there as well so you're going to have
four<00:02:50.600> total<00:02:50.810> files<00:02:51.170> in<00:02:51.440> your<00:02:51.500> NV<00:02:51.890> flash

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:52.100 
four total files in your NV flash

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:54.850 
four total files in your NV flash
directory<00:02:52.870> okay<00:02:53.870> the<00:02:54.020> next<00:02:54.230> step<00:02:54.320> is<00:02:54.620> to<00:02:54.740> open

00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:54.860 
directory okay the next step is to open

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:56.710 
directory okay the next step is to open
up<00:02:55.010> the<00:02:55.160> administrative<00:02:55.760> command<00:02:56.090> prompt<00:02:56.540> and

Drive NV flash folder that we made and

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:20.860 
Drive NV flash folder that we made and
then<00:03:16.220> type<00:03:16.700> in<00:03:16.910> NV<00:03:17.360> flash<00:03:19.210> space<00:03:20.210> the<00:03:20.570> file

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:20.870 
then type in NV flash space the file

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:30.130 
then type in NV flash space the file

now<00:03:30.470> what<00:03:31.100> that<00:03:31.130> override<00:03:31.700> command<00:03:32.120> does<00:03:32.360> is

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:32.600 
now what that override command does is

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:35.950 
now what that override command does is
it<00:03:32.750> allows<00:03:32.990> for<00:03:33.050> a<00:03:33.860> firmware<00:03:34.370> and<00:03:34.760> adapter<00:03:35.420> PCI

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:35.960 
it allows for a firmware and adapter PCI

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:39.250 
it allows for a firmware and adapter PCI
subsystem<00:03:36.710> ID<00:03:36.980> mismatch<00:03:38.110> essentially<00:03:39.110> what

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:39.260 
subsystem ID mismatch essentially what

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:42.220 
subsystem ID mismatch essentially what
that<00:03:39.290> means<00:03:39.440> is<00:03:40.160> the<00:03:40.880> stock<00:03:41.180> ROM<00:03:41.480> image<00:03:41.870> that

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:42.230 
that means is the stock ROM image that

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:44.410 
that means is the stock ROM image that
you<00:03:42.440> have<00:03:42.680> on<00:03:43.100> your<00:03:43.340> graphics<00:03:43.670> card<00:03:43.880> does<00:03:44.150> not

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:44.420 
you have on your graphics card does not

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:47.440 
you have on your graphics card does not
match<00:03:45.130> the<00:03:46.130> ROM<00:03:46.580> image<00:03:46.940> that<00:03:47.150> you're<00:03:47.240> about<00:03:47.390> to

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:47.450 
match the ROM image that you're about to

00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:50.710 
match the ROM image that you're about to
flash<00:03:47.920> so<00:03:48.920> this<00:03:49.340> override<00:03:49.730> command<00:03:50.450> enables

00:03:50.710 --> 00:03:50.720 
flash so this override command enables

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:54.580 
flash so this override command enables
you<00:03:51.080> to<00:03:52.120> do<00:03:53.120> a<00:03:53.150> force<00:03:53.450> flash<00:03:53.720> essentially<00:03:54.380> of

00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:54.590 
you to do a force flash essentially of

00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:58.000 
you to do a force flash essentially of
