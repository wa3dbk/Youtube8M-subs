00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:33.550
 good role-playing series 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:46.050
 where the tantrums of time unfolds over 23 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:48.350
 years before the events of the first part many 

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:50.620
 familiar characters are still young however 

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:52.840
 passion van menture is already losing serious 

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:53.350
 by fire 

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:55.469
 Our hero swims to study in the port 

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:57.250
 the city should be ed the same company 

00:00:57.250 --> 00:00:59.609
 is still a living organ of combat 

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:01.739
 badass shaped charming goblet 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:04.340
 england and pretty or date 

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:06.110
 for a place in general we ask 

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:08.100
 staying at the obvious dope 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:09.960
 prevailing in the journey no one 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:11.790
 expected what could happen 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:14.880
 something to attack but it still happens 1 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:16.950
 pirates and after a little brawl 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:20.030
 the main character sends a blow to the head 

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:22.240
 uncomfortable to sleep 

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:25.090
 and for the first time everything is already in the city 

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:27.610
 ask the operator nobody knows anything 

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:29.760
 the borrower of the city is happening some sort 

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:31.990
 strange things port chief 

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:34.490

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:36.690
 your country interest 

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:38.960
 gradually step by step we open 

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:40.750
 the veil of secrecy and handed over to stand 

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:42.260
 unexpected picture 

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:45.260
 no evil dragons no malcor 

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:48.260
 just an ordinary sort of conspiracy 

00:01:53.370 --> 00:01:55.430
 throughout half the game hero 

00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:57.800
 find out what happens at all 

00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:00.190
 what it costs to whom it is necessary and in general 

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:01.590
 is being started 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:04.020
 and what is especially pleased with the task became 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:06.140
 the order is more interesting still happy that 

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:08.380
 mission style avoided killed 

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:10.339
 ramirez almost disappeared 

00:02:10.339 --> 00:02:12.269
 no, of course nobody talks about them 

00:02:12.269 --> 00:02:14.309
 absence but there are so few of them 

00:02:14.309 --> 00:02:15.919
 I don't want to find fault 

00:02:15.919 --> 00:02:18.379
 scriptwriters have worked well 

00:02:18.379 --> 00:02:21.299
 each task has its own mini story 

00:02:21.299 --> 00:02:23.019
 you treat puzzles too 

00:02:23.019 --> 00:02:25.459
 benefited the idea of ​​breaks when us 

00:02:25.459 --> 00:02:27.180
 no need to wash your enemies powder 

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:29.459
 team to think on a simple sale 

00:02:29.459 --> 00:02:30.699
 nice puzzle 

00:02:30.699 --> 00:02:33.329
 key functions and at ease 

00:02:33.329 --> 00:02:34.500
 go to the sector 

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:37.370
 promised nonlinearity no differs only 

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:39.550
 initial missions of the reaction of some 

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:42.410
 personalities expensive and passing some 

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:43.279
 tasks 

00:02:43.279 --> 00:02:45.049
 sometimes offers to choose 

00:02:45.049 --> 00:02:47.379
 whom to save from the death of a partner armenia 

00:02:47.379 --> 00:02:49.000
 specifics 

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.460
 give the fraudster to the guests 

00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:53.640
 but one single final yet 

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:56.879
 whatever your decision 

00:02:56.879 --> 00:02:58.969
 cjsc Belarusian as a whole a little 

00:02:58.969 --> 00:03:00.290
 different from the original 

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:02.299
 it's just a big cache with new ones 

00:03:02.299 --> 00:03:04.659
 corporeal plots and various 

00:03:04.659 --> 00:03:07.209
 little things from the more you get 

00:03:07.209 --> 00:03:09.709
 exactly the same as two years ago role-playing 

00:03:09.709 --> 00:03:12.609
 the system is also deep and interesting in 

00:03:12.609 --> 00:03:14.870
 the game has become three classes more and also 

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:16.290
 it became more and in every way 

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:18.250
 characteristics with skills many 

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:20.280
 abilities are still useless and 

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:23.170
 used two or three times for the whole game and 

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:25.409
 we are not used at all 

00:03:25.409 --> 00:03:28.120
 boevka everything is also the old slowly with 

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:29.909
 using all sorts of skills and 

00:03:29.909 --> 00:03:31.829
 spells 

00:03:31.829 --> 00:03:33.479
 sudden movements 

00:03:33.479 --> 00:03:35.789
 all my registry moves are tactical 

00:03:35.789 --> 00:03:37.569
 pause still in stock and in 

00:03:37.569 --> 00:03:39.889
 In many cases, everything also performs its 

00:03:39.889 --> 00:03:42.869
 the role here of any five years to give orders 

00:03:42.869 --> 00:03:43.860
 my companion 

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:45.970
 the graphics in the game remain the same but 

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:47.430
 beautiful places in the interior 

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:49.059
 increased at times 

00:03:49.059 --> 00:03:51.479
 But how do they like to be somewhere on 

00:03:51.479 --> 00:03:53.649
 slope and look to order 

00:03:53.649 --> 00:03:55.839
 labor it looks very beautiful without 

00:03:55.839 --> 00:03:57.909
 pranks the style which is sustained to trifles 

00:03:57.909 --> 00:03:59.519
 impressive 

00:03:59.519 --> 00:04:01.650
 still can not but rejoice fast 

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:03.049
 moving 

00:04:03.049 --> 00:04:05.650
 I think they will go to a place 

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:07.510
 Now open the mini 

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:10.540
 enter the territory with quick 

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:12.209
 movement will move already 

00:04:12.209 --> 00:04:14.549
 the exploration of places the world is huge here 

00:04:14.549 --> 00:04:16.629
 so time more than turn around 

00:04:16.629 --> 00:04:19.560
 separate pleasant by those who exactly blankets 

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:21.269
 from which at times increased 

00:04:21.269 --> 00:04:23.419
 amount of good humor and survivor 

00:04:23.419 --> 00:04:24.590
 after such a blow 

00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:26.900
 The text clearly favors as much as possible. 

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:29.840
 their arias is just so short and checkers 

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:33.259
 as for reportedly 

00:04:33.259 --> 00:04:34.590
 fights 

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:36.540
 I want at least for the day of Kiev 

00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:39.320
 ceased to dog each other 

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:42.009
 that is difficult 

00:04:42.009 --> 00:04:43.659
 what about when 

00:04:43.659 --> 00:04:45.659
 by half 

00:04:45.659 --> 00:04:47.239
 it seems that someone wakes up 

00:04:47.239 --> 00:04:49.449
 it's easier to trace the character 

00:04:49.449 --> 00:04:50.949
 characters Russian localization 

00:04:50.949 --> 00:04:53.819
 performed great actors done 

00:04:53.819 --> 00:04:56.550
 colossal work rarely localization 

00:04:56.550 --> 00:04:58.800
 is at the original level but such 

00:04:58.800 --> 00:04:59.620
 happens 

00:04:59.620 --> 00:05:01.449
 about this case 

00:05:01.449 --> 00:05:03.259
 Rustavi Bay undoubtedly 

00:05:03.259 --> 00:05:05.319
 fans will enjoy the first part of the game 

00:05:05.319 --> 00:05:07.039
 it remains exactly the same as the two 

00:05:07.039 --> 00:05:09.469
 years ago and if they played then they will 

00:05:09.469 --> 00:05:11.629
 play now even if not played 

00:05:11.629 --> 00:05:13.729
 the first part try maybe u 

00:05:13.729 --> 00:05:16.729
 you are attracted by this extraordinary gaming 

00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:34.830
 32 in the SEC
