this<00:01:55.920> is<00:01:55.979> just<00:01:56.280> a<00:01:56.369> single<00:01:56.729> sheet<00:01:56.969> bypass

00:01:57.469 --> 00:01:57.479 
this is just a single sheet bypass

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:00.740 
this is just a single sheet bypass
feeder<00:01:57.750> and<00:01:58.159> to<00:01:59.159> get<00:01:59.340> to<00:01:59.490> the<00:01:59.610> toners<00:02:00.149> there<00:02:00.479> is

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:00.750 
feeder and to get to the toners there is

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:02.469 
feeder and to get to the toners there is
a<00:02:00.780> switch<00:02:01.140> here<00:02:01.439> on<00:02:01.530> the<00:02:01.619> right-hand<00:02:01.829> side

00:02:02.469 --> 00:02:02.479 
a switch here on the right-hand side

00:02:02.479 --> 00:02:07.940 
a switch here on the right-hand side
when<00:02:03.479> you<00:02:03.659> squeeze<00:02:04.530> a<00:02:04.560> switch<00:02:06.200> the<00:02:07.200> lid<00:02:07.590> lifts

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:07.950 
when you squeeze a switch the lid lifts

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:09.889 
when you squeeze a switch the lid lifts
up<00:02:08.069> and<00:02:08.250> it<00:02:08.340> locks<00:02:08.550> into<00:02:08.819> place<00:02:09.000> like<00:02:09.450> this<00:02:09.720> so

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:09.899 
up and it locks into place like this so

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:11.059 
up and it locks into place like this so
you're<00:02:09.989> not<00:02:10.050> going<00:02:10.200> to<00:02:10.289> trap<00:02:10.500> your<00:02:10.679> fingers

00:02:11.059 --> 00:02:11.069 
you're not going to trap your fingers

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:13.220 
you're not going to trap your fingers
while<00:02:11.280> you're<00:02:11.700> getting<00:02:11.910> the<00:02:12.360> toners<00:02:12.810> out<00:02:12.989> so

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:13.230 
while you're getting the toners out so

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:13.809 
while you're getting the toners out so
telling

00:02:13.809 --> 00:02:13.819 
telling

00:02:13.819 --> 00:02:18.069 
telling
simply<00:02:14.510> pull<00:02:14.749> out<00:02:14.780> like<00:02:15.170> so<00:02:16.150> you'll<00:02:17.150> notice<00:02:17.480> a

00:02:18.069 --> 00:02:18.079 
simply pull out like so you'll notice a

00:02:18.079 --> 00:02:20.860 
simply pull out like so you'll notice a
common<00:02:18.620> theme<00:02:19.069> with<00:02:19.579> a<00:02:19.609> Lexmark<00:02:20.209> design<00:02:20.629> they

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:20.870 
common theme with a Lexmark design they

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:22.869 
common theme with a Lexmark design they
do<00:02:21.019> have<00:02:21.230> printers<00:02:21.799> that<00:02:22.340> work<00:02:22.579> in<00:02:22.790> exactly

00:02:22.869 --> 00:02:22.879 
do have printers that work in exactly

00:02:22.879 --> 00:02:25.509 
do have printers that work in exactly
the<00:02:23.329> same<00:02:23.569> way<00:02:23.900> so<00:02:24.680> there<00:02:24.859> are<00:02:25.159> the<00:02:25.310> four

00:02:25.509 --> 00:02:25.519 
the same way so there are the four

00:02:25.519 --> 00:02:28.300 
the same way so there are the four
toners<00:02:26.239> you<00:02:26.989> could<00:02:27.200> pull<00:02:27.379> the<00:02:27.469> front<00:02:27.650> of<00:02:28.010> the

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:28.310 
toners you could pull the front of the

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:31.209 
toners you could pull the front of the
printer<00:02:28.519> down<00:02:28.730> like<00:02:29.060> so<00:02:29.450> and<00:02:29.689> here<00:02:30.500> you<00:02:30.889> have

00:02:31.209 --> 00:02:31.219 
printer down like so and here you have

00:02:31.219 --> 00:02:33.550 
printer down like so and here you have
access<00:02:31.430> to<00:02:32.150> where<00:02:32.359> the<00:02:32.510> paper<00:02:32.689> comes<00:02:33.019> out<00:02:33.260> and

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:33.560 
access to where the paper comes out and

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:36.039 
access to where the paper comes out and
through<00:02:34.310> and<00:02:34.609> out<00:02:35.000> of<00:02:35.359> the<00:02:35.599> back<00:02:35.810> of<00:02:35.959> the

00:02:36.039 --> 00:02:36.049 
through and out of the back of the

00:02:36.049 --> 00:02:38.470 
through and out of the back of the
machine<00:02:36.439> if<00:02:36.739> you<00:02:36.980> get<00:02:37.099> a<00:02:37.129> paper<00:02:37.430> jam<00:02:37.760> you<00:02:38.299> can

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:38.480 
machine if you get a paper jam you can

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:41.259 
machine if you get a paper jam you can
access<00:02:38.900> that<00:02:39.139> from<00:02:39.379> there<00:02:39.739> and<00:02:40.040> then<00:02:40.609> let<00:02:41.150> me

00:02:41.259 --> 00:02:41.269 
access that from there and then let me

00:02:41.269 --> 00:02:45.190 
access that from there and then let me
just<00:02:41.480> get<00:02:41.629> round<00:02:41.930> at<00:02:42.200> this<00:02:42.379> side<00:02:44.139> this<00:02:45.139> side

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:45.200 
just get round at this side this side

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:47.709 
just get round at this side this side
panel<00:02:45.829> comes<00:02:46.069> off<00:02:46.400> so<00:02:46.879> when<00:02:47.239> we<00:02:47.389> take<00:02:47.540> the

00:02:47.709 --> 00:02:47.719 
panel comes off so when we take the

00:02:47.719 --> 00:02:55.300 
panel comes off so when we take the
siphon<00:02:48.049> off<00:02:50.169> like<00:02:51.169> so<00:02:53.379> we<00:02:54.379> can<00:02:54.409> get<00:02:54.680> to<00:02:54.949> the

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:55.310 
siphon off like so we can get to the

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:58.929 
siphon off like so we can get to the
waste<00:02:55.549> toner<00:02:55.909> bottle<00:02:56.419> which<00:02:56.959> comes<00:02:57.260> out<00:02:57.939> just

00:02:58.929 --> 00:02:58.939 
waste toner bottle which comes out just

00:02:58.939 --> 00:03:01.659 
waste toner bottle which comes out just
by<00:02:59.180> pushing<00:02:59.629> the<00:02:59.989> green<00:03:00.230> switches<00:03:00.620> this<00:03:01.519> is

00:03:01.659 --> 00:03:01.669 
by pushing the green switches this is

00:03:01.669 --> 00:03:03.550 
by pushing the green switches this is
empty<00:03:02.060> when<00:03:02.329> it<00:03:02.449> fills<00:03:02.599> up<00:03:02.840> you<00:03:03.169> buy<00:03:03.319> a<00:03:03.349> new<00:03:03.530> one

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:03.560 
empty when it fills up you buy a new one

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:05.709 
empty when it fills up you buy a new one
from<00:03:03.829> printerbase<00:03:04.129> and<00:03:04.579> you<00:03:05.269> can<00:03:05.389> slot<00:03:05.569> it

00:03:05.709 --> 00:03:05.719 
from printerbase and you can slot it

00:03:05.719 --> 00:03:10.409 
from printerbase and you can slot it
back<00:03:05.870> in<00:03:06.049> quite<00:03:06.379> easily<00:03:07.540> you<00:03:08.540> also<00:03:08.750> have<00:03:09.349> here

00:03:10.409 --> 00:03:10.419 
back in quite easily you also have here

00:03:10.419 --> 00:03:14.080 
back in quite easily you also have here
the<00:03:11.419> imaging<00:03:12.109> kit<00:03:12.530> now<00:03:13.010> you<00:03:13.669> have<00:03:13.819> talked

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:14.090 
the imaging kit now you have talked

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:16.780 
the imaging kit now you have talked
about<00:03:14.299> this<00:03:14.599> previously<00:03:15.019> so<00:03:15.859> the<00:03:16.099> imaging<00:03:16.489> kit

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:16.790 
about this previously so the imaging kit

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:20.199 
about this previously so the imaging kit
is<00:03:17.180> what<00:03:18.079> actually<00:03:18.470> puts<00:03:18.769> the<00:03:19.040> toner<00:03:19.370> onto<00:03:20.090> the

00:03:20.199 --> 00:03:20.209 
is what actually puts the toner onto the

00:03:20.209 --> 00:03:22.689 
is what actually puts the toner onto the
paper<00:03:20.389> itself<00:03:20.900> and<00:03:21.229> they<00:03:22.069> do<00:03:22.189> last<00:03:22.400> quite<00:03:22.519> a

00:03:22.689 --> 00:03:22.699 
paper itself and they do last quite a

00:03:22.699 --> 00:03:24.819 
paper itself and they do last quite a
long<00:03:22.939> time<00:03:23.180> so<00:03:23.540> most<00:03:23.810> users<00:03:24.290> won't<00:03:24.439> need<00:03:24.709> to

00:03:24.819 --> 00:03:24.829 
long time so most users won't need to

00:03:24.829 --> 00:03:26.710 
long time so most users won't need to
replace<00:03:25.129> them<00:03:25.489> where<00:03:25.939> you<00:03:26.030> can<00:03:26.180> see<00:03:26.389> that<00:03:26.599> if

00:03:26.710 --> 00:03:26.720 
replace them where you can see that if

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:28.689 
replace them where you can see that if
you<00:03:26.840> do<00:03:26.989> need<00:03:27.290> to<00:03:27.409> replace<00:03:27.709> them<00:03:27.979> they<00:03:28.519> all

00:03:28.689 --> 00:03:28.699 
you do need to replace them they all

00:03:28.699 --> 00:03:30.069 
you do need to replace them they all
come<00:03:28.970> out<00:03:29.090> very<00:03:29.299> easily

00:03:30.069 --> 00:03:30.079 
come out very easily

00:03:30.079 --> 00:03:31.780 
come out very easily
and<00:03:30.290> slot<00:03:30.889> back<00:03:31.099> in<00:03:31.310> I'm<00:03:31.430> not<00:03:31.549> going<00:03:31.669> to<00:03:31.729> go

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:31.790 
and slot back in I'm not going to go

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:35.259 
and slot back in I'm not going to go
into<00:03:32.030> too<00:03:32.269> much<00:03:32.299> detail<00:03:32.810> on<00:03:33.349> these<00:03:34.250> units<00:03:35.000> here

00:03:35.259 --> 00:03:35.269 
into too much detail on these units here

00:03:35.269 --> 00:03:39.640 
into too much detail on these units here
but<00:03:35.720> we<00:03:35.810> do<00:03:36.049> have<00:03:36.079> a<00:03:37.000> cs3<00:03:38.000> 10<00:03:38.389> video<00:03:38.780> which<00:03:39.439> is

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:39.650 
but we do have a cs3 10 video which is

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:40.780 
but we do have a cs3 10 video which is
just<00:03:39.859> the<00:03:39.919> printed<00:03:40.310> version<00:03:40.579> of<00:03:40.669> this

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:40.790 
just the printed version of this

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:42.969 
just the printed version of this
multifunction<00:03:41.569> machine<00:03:41.900> and<00:03:42.139> I<00:03:42.500> go<00:03:42.680> into

00:03:42.969 --> 00:03:42.979 
multifunction machine and I go into

00:03:42.979 --> 00:03:44.949 
multifunction machine and I go into
quite<00:03:43.220> a<00:03:43.280> lot<00:03:43.549> of<00:03:43.579> detail<00:03:43.849> in<00:03:44.329> that<00:03:44.629> video<00:03:44.810> so

00:03:44.949 --> 00:03:44.959 
quite a lot of detail in that video so

00:03:44.959 --> 00:03:48.219 
quite a lot of detail in that video so
take<00:03:45.319> a<00:03:45.379> look<00:03:45.680> if<00:03:46.040> you<00:03:46.370> are<00:03:46.579> interested<00:03:47.329> in<00:03:48.019> the

00:03:48.219 --> 00:03:48.229 
take a look if you are interested in the

00:03:48.229 --> 00:03:49.929 
take a look if you are interested in the
inner<00:03:48.439> workings<00:03:49.040> of<00:03:49.159> this<00:03:49.340> machine<00:03:49.699> so<00:03:49.909> I

00:03:49.929 --> 00:03:49.939 
inner workings of this machine so I

00:03:49.939 --> 00:03:51.399 
inner workings of this machine so I
could<00:03:50.090> just<00:03:50.329> flop<00:03:50.569> this<00:03:50.780> all<00:03:51.019> back<00:03:51.199> together

00:03:51.399 --> 00:03:51.409 
could just flop this all back together

00:03:51.409 --> 00:03:54.819 
could just flop this all back together
now<00:03:51.829> for<00:03:52.189> you<00:03:52.750> it's<00:03:53.750> just<00:03:54.019> hopeful<00:03:54.409> gives<00:03:54.650> you

00:03:54.819 --> 00:03:54.829 
now for you it's just hopeful gives you

00:03:54.829 --> 00:03:57.339 
now for you it's just hopeful gives you
a<00:03:54.859> bit<00:03:54.949> of<00:03:55.040> an<00:03:55.129> idea<00:03:55.699> of<00:03:56.479> how<00:03:56.780> easy<00:03:56.810> this

00:03:57.339 --> 00:03:57.349 
a bit of an idea of how easy this

00:03:57.349 --> 00:03:58.959 
a bit of an idea of how easy this
machine<00:03:57.739> is<00:03:57.889> to<00:03:57.919> maintain<00:03:58.519> so<00:03:58.729> they're<00:03:58.849> all

00:03:58.959 --> 00:03:58.969 
machine is to maintain so they're all

00:03:58.969 --> 00:04:01.569 
machine is to maintain so they're all
color-coded<00:03:59.719> so<00:04:00.049> this<00:04:00.199> is<00:04:00.319> the<00:04:00.439> magenta<00:04:01.009> and

00:04:01.569 --> 00:04:01.579 
color-coded so this is the magenta and

00:04:01.579 --> 00:04:03.729 
color-coded so this is the magenta and
that<00:04:01.729> will<00:04:01.849> go<00:04:01.969> into<00:04:02.419> the<00:04:02.629> magenta<00:04:03.079> slot

00:04:03.729 --> 00:04:03.739 
that will go into the magenta slot

00:04:03.739 --> 00:04:08.289 
that will go into the magenta slot
okay<00:04:04.430> the<00:04:04.549> black<00:04:04.819> is<00:04:05.290> their<00:04:06.459> yellow<00:04:07.459> as<00:04:08.180> you

00:04:08.289 --> 00:04:08.299 
okay the black is their yellow as you

00:04:08.299 --> 00:04:09.729 
okay the black is their yellow as you
can<00:04:08.449> see<00:04:08.629> it<00:04:08.719> doesn't<00:04:08.989> matter<00:04:09.169> which<00:04:09.469> order

00:04:09.729 --> 00:04:09.739 
can see it doesn't matter which order

00:04:09.739 --> 00:04:15.789 
can see it doesn't matter which order
you<00:04:10.729> put<00:04:10.879> them<00:04:11.030> in<00:04:11.180> and<00:04:12.519> plan<00:04:13.519> finally<00:04:14.799> will

00:04:15.789 --> 00:04:15.799 
you put them in and plan finally will

00:04:15.799 --> 00:04:18.729 
you put them in and plan finally will
pop<00:04:16.009> the<00:04:16.789> side<00:04:17.030> door<00:04:17.329> back<00:04:17.570> on

00:04:18.729 --> 00:04:18.739 
pop the side door back on

00:04:18.739 --> 00:04:23.330 
pop the side door back on
close<00:04:19.739> the<00:04:20.340> front<00:04:21.410> as<00:04:22.410> I<00:04:22.560> said<00:04:22.740> this<00:04:22.860> is<00:04:22.920> locked

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:23.340 
close the front as I said this is locked

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:26.060 
close the front as I said this is locked
so<00:04:23.730> all<00:04:23.880> we<00:04:23.970> do<00:04:24.090> is<00:04:24.240> squeeze<00:04:24.540> again<00:04:24.960> and<00:04:25.830> goes

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:26.070 
so all we do is squeeze again and goes

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:28.940 
so all we do is squeeze again and goes
down<00:04:26.750> back<00:04:27.750> into<00:04:27.930> place<00:04:28.140> let<00:04:28.350> me<00:04:28.440> just<00:04:28.620> spin

00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:28.950 
down back into place let me just spin

00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:30.710 
down back into place let me just spin
the<00:04:29.220> machine<00:04:29.520> round<00:04:29.850> for<00:04:30.150> you<00:04:30.270> just<00:04:30.450> to<00:04:30.540> take

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:30.720 
the machine round for you just to take

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:32.990 
the machine round for you just to take
you<00:04:31.410> for<00:04:31.650> a<00:04:31.680> walk<00:04:31.710> around<00:04:32.250> the<00:04:32.400> machine<00:04:32.760> it's

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:33.000 
you for a walk around the machine it's

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:36.800 
you for a walk around the machine it's
quite<00:04:33.360> heavy<00:04:33.900> and<00:04:34.680> it<00:04:35.250> has<00:04:35.490> rubber<00:04:35.880> feet<00:04:36.000> so<00:04:36.570> it

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:36.810 
quite heavy and it has rubber feet so it

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:39.740 
quite heavy and it has rubber feet so it
is<00:04:37.020> difficult<00:04:37.290> to<00:04:37.650> spin<00:04:38.070> round<00:04:38.370> there<00:04:39.330> we<00:04:39.540> go

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:39.750 
is difficult to spin round there we go

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:41.390 
is difficult to spin round there we go
so<00:04:40.020> here's<00:04:40.500> the<00:04:40.650> back<00:04:40.770> of<00:04:40.890> the<00:04:40.950> machine<00:04:41.160> got

00:04:41.390 --> 00:04:41.400 
so here's the back of the machine got

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:44.420 
so here's the back of the machine got
the<00:04:41.490> network<00:04:41.820> connection<00:04:42.570> there<00:04:42.750> USB<00:04:43.680> and<00:04:43.980> if

00:04:44.420 --> 00:04:44.430 
the network connection there USB and if

00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:46.070 
the network connection there USB and if
you<00:04:44.520> go<00:04:44.640> for<00:04:44.790> the<00:04:44.850> Wi-Fi<00:04:45.270> dongle<00:04:45.510> that<00:04:45.900> just

00:04:46.070 --> 00:04:46.080 
you go for the Wi-Fi dongle that just

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:48.560 
you go for the Wi-Fi dongle that just
plugs<00:04:46.290> in<00:04:46.440> there<00:04:46.650> power<00:04:47.400> socket<00:04:47.820> in<00:04:47.940> there

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:48.570 
plugs in there power socket in there

00:04:48.570 --> 00:04:51.470 
plugs in there power socket in there
spin<00:04:49.140> it<00:04:49.230> around<00:04:49.290> a<00:04:49.440> bit<00:04:49.560> further<00:04:49.770> and<00:04:50.330> you<00:04:51.330> can

00:04:51.470 --> 00:04:51.480 
spin it around a bit further and you can

00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:53.240 
spin it around a bit further and you can
see<00:04:51.690> the<00:04:51.900> power<00:04:52.110> switch<00:04:52.260> there<00:04:52.650> on<00:04:52.800> that<00:04:52.980> side

00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:53.250 
see the power switch there on that side

00:04:53.250 --> 00:04:57.260 
see the power switch there on that side
I<00:04:53.580> think<00:04:54.570> that<00:04:55.610> gives<00:04:56.610> you<00:04:56.760> a<00:04:56.820> bit<00:04:57.060> of<00:04:57.090> an

00:04:57.260 --> 00:04:57.270 
I think that gives you a bit of an

00:04:57.270 --> 00:04:59.660 
I think that gives you a bit of an
overview<00:04:57.630> of<00:04:57.930> the<00:04:58.020> machine<00:04:58.620> if<00:04:58.830> you<00:04:59.490> would

00:04:59.660 --> 00:04:59.670 
overview of the machine if you would

00:04:59.670 --> 00:05:01.430 
overview of the machine if you would
like<00:04:59.850> more<00:05:00.030> information<00:05:00.300> than<00:05:00.810> obviously<00:05:01.260> get

00:05:01.430 --> 00:05:01.440 
like more information than obviously get

00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:02.690 
like more information than obviously get
in<00:05:01.620> touch<00:05:01.860> we're<00:05:02.070> going<00:05:02.190> to<00:05:02.250> now<00:05:02.340> look<00:05:02.370> at<00:05:02.640> the

00:05:02.690 --> 00:05:02.700 
in touch we're going to now look at the

00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:05.450 
in touch we're going to now look at the
machine<00:05:03.030> printing<00:05:03.740> I've<00:05:04.740> now<00:05:05.010> set<00:05:05.250> this
