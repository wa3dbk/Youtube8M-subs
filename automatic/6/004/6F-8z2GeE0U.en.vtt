00:00:06.850 --> 00:00:12.740
 hello everyone today i'm doing a video on 

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:16.850
 request and I was asked to do 

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:19.730
 lamb say immediately that in the area 

00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:21.560
 I am very much involved in animal husbandry 

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:23.120
 flowers and trees are what i love 

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:25.760
 make from beads 

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:30.110
 but nevertheless I will try it will be the one 

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:32.210
 the same is a challenge for me but here I am 

00:00:30.110 --> 00:00:35.450
 share a little plan as I decided 

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:39.559
 all make this big bead this 

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:44.149
 there will be a lamb head according to this pattern 

00:00:39.559 --> 00:00:46.579
 cut her body out of the material and on 

00:00:44.149 --> 00:00:51.170
 i have this head 

00:00:46.579 --> 00:00:52.879
 I will decorate a little with nose and eyes and ears 

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:57.710
 and then on the material 

00:00:52.879 --> 00:00:59.690
 at night well, how would such a nap with beads 

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:01.940
 it's like such a plan see what of 

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:05.570
 I will do this for a start 

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:07.729
 muzzle and muzzle for muzzle here to me 

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:09.920
 need such a piece of wire 

00:01:07.729 --> 00:01:16.910
 first i wear a black bead and 

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:18.950
 scrolling and a little then I 

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:22.030
 replaying these little things matter 

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:22.030
 from two sides 

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:37.780
 it's my mouth and nose should simultaneously 

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:37.780
 turn out 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:47.520
 next i do eye and for this i am you and 

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:50.630
 Hebe wire and see that eye 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:56.390
 it will be but at about this height 

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:56.390
 I then twist the wires together 

00:02:17.319 --> 00:02:26.810
 the very kudlaka looks like 

00:02:21.879 --> 00:02:29.030
 then I do too and ears and will also 

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:31.930
 make black beads like that 

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:31.930
 hanging 

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:04.830
 but for now it looks like this 

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:08.760
 more or less stim ears like 

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:16.440
 muzzle testicles further I choose a place 

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:20.930
 where the head will be located for 

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:20.930
 started taking a couple of white beads 

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:34.510
 head of course will be done right 

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:36.640
 because for the seamy side 

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:39.840
 cut out of the skin that's exactly the same 

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:42.160
 a piece and it will then override and 

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:45.120
 fix it at that height 

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:47.880
 Well, now you can proceed to 

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:53.190
 embroidery for this I need 

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:53.190
 white thread needle but here's the blank 

00:04:00.460 --> 00:04:09.960
 I take on 2 things at first I do as 

00:04:04.570 --> 00:04:12.640
 would be extremely row and always take 2 pieces and 

00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:14.440
 go to the second I do it like this 

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:17.230
 specifically not to do later 

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:20.200
 finishing row it turns out that this 

00:04:17.230 --> 00:04:23.400
 the row is bent slightly inside out and 

00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:23.400
 looks beautiful 

00:04:32.409 --> 00:04:40.209
 I am stitching 2 then I take out the needle 

00:04:37.119 --> 00:04:46.689
 about the middle I am going through the second 

00:04:40.209 --> 00:04:49.029
 and then I type 2 again and it turns out that 

00:04:46.689 --> 00:04:51.249
 the row holds very tightly each 

00:04:49.029 --> 00:04:55.659
 the bead passes get stitched 

00:04:51.249 --> 00:04:58.919
 Well, I sheathed this part . this is where 

00:04:55.659 --> 00:05:02.679
 there will be a head and now I start doing 

00:04:58.919 --> 00:05:05.619
 lamb wool it will be eyelets 

00:05:02.679 --> 00:05:12.179
 loops again loops I thread 

00:05:05.619 --> 00:05:16.509
 needle I start from the bottom and collect beads 

00:05:12.179 --> 00:05:18.879
 So I scored 12 beads and now I'm 

00:05:16.509 --> 00:05:23.099
 here I needle out of here 

00:05:18.879 --> 00:05:26.379
 side by side i run the needle back 

00:05:23.099 --> 00:05:29.019
 such an eyelet is formed and here 

00:05:26.379 --> 00:05:32.099
 such loops I have done so much to 

00:05:29.019 --> 00:05:35.829
 cover the entire surface of this area 

00:05:32.099 --> 00:05:37.990
 then at the end I will sew paws and 

00:05:35.829 --> 00:05:41.379
 most likely there will be only two because 

00:05:37.990 --> 00:05:43.119
 that since I have a lamb so shaggy 

00:05:41.379 --> 00:05:46.569
 This hind legs and in fact would definitely not 

00:05:43.119 --> 00:05:49.809
 I want to show what I have up to 

00:05:46.569 --> 00:05:52.329
 so far it turned out these are all the loops 

00:05:49.809 --> 00:05:56.409
 loops here where the head loops here 

00:05:52.329 --> 00:05:58.689
 length and I have already gained 18 16 beads in 

00:05:56.409 --> 00:06:01.059
 one loop but there are about 6 of them 

00:05:58.689 --> 00:06:04.179
 pieces on legs 

00:06:01.059 --> 00:06:06.729
 I scored 9 beads then three more 

00:06:04.179 --> 00:06:09.519
 three spun like here in nine 

00:06:06.729 --> 00:06:11.800
 come back on what am I 

00:06:09.519 --> 00:06:13.409
 you need to do it by J and this one 

00:06:11.800 --> 00:06:14.949
 here's the part so you can 

00:06:13.409 --> 00:06:17.439
 to glue 

00:06:14.949 --> 00:06:22.139
 skin for that i just like that 

00:06:17.439 --> 00:06:22.139
 I pass large stitches on the base 

00:06:36.380 --> 00:06:42.840
 Of course, if you and the sheep can 

00:06:39.330 --> 00:06:46.230
 get anything for example brooch 

00:06:42.840 --> 00:06:48.390
 if you change a pin from behind but I donâ€™t know 

00:06:46.230 --> 00:06:53.280
 about brooches are not sure yet and better 

00:06:48.390 --> 00:06:54.390
 make a pendant on the Christmas tree or just as 

00:06:53.280 --> 00:06:59.030
 home decor 

00:06:54.390 --> 00:06:59.030
 so I take here a piece of ribbon 

00:07:04.490 --> 00:07:11.790
 further so I already have a blank ready 

00:07:07.560 --> 00:07:12.650
 it's good I take the glue from me 

00:07:11.790 --> 00:07:17.550
 that's glue 

00:07:12.650 --> 00:07:20.490
 found some house and swore it the same 

00:07:17.550 --> 00:07:23.810
 the very thing that glue moment glues quickly and 

00:07:20.490 --> 00:07:23.810
 securely ups 

00:07:43.129 --> 00:07:48.279
 but now I just have to wait 

00:07:45.289 --> 00:07:51.439
 to keep it tight 

00:07:48.279 --> 00:07:53.300
 stuck so that everything is dry but I 

00:07:51.439 --> 00:07:55.550
 I will wait for your comments 

00:07:53.300 --> 00:07:59.979
 to find out how you like such a sheep 

00:07:55.550 --> 00:07:59.979
 liked it thank you for your attention and good luck
