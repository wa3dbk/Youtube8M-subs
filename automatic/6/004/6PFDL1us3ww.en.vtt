00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.540
 dear garden video point is coming my 

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:06.660
 name is markus planing behind the camera 

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:10.050
 in front of the camera peter haslhofer dahlien 

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:12.509
 breeder st pancras in upper austria 

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:15.690
 here his dahlias gardener Peter our 

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:17.940
 theme is the flower care the 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:19.949
 flower care bathing dahlem what to do 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:22.020
 to have as nice loans as possible 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:24.119
 so they bloom rich and what do you need 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:26.099
 make that second question that one 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:28.740
 beautiful long stems as a cut flower 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:31.820
 So yes that 's basically 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:34.890
 once the variety and music varieties 

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:36.590
 accept the relatively long-stemmed ones 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:39.270
 bring the election seem stile 

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:40.980
 there is always good choice we have 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:43.040
 a lot of hospital in the what so easy 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:45.000
 suitable for a cut durability 

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:47.370
 extra trick is just that 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.899
 reach out for the buds in the light 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:51.440
 Just show that they are the rows 

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:54.149
 At that time I slow down first 

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:56.010
 divorced or do you want to show here 

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:57.480
 yes , there's the one now 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:59.370
 middle buds were then the 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:01.680
 lateral buds outlook in those 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:03.960
 stadium where the buds are about peas big 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:07.500
 have the advantage that they are then 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:10.380
 a nice strong bloom get like 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:12.510
 for example, there hobbits what I 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:14.880
 believe that days that one there 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:19.380
 have broken out in front of about three 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:20.939
 weeks then have one have a main 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:24.030
 drove a prime bloom what I here 

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:25.830
 can cut in about 40 cm or 50 cm 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:28.470
 Some listened in any case 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:30.119
 and I have no buds on the side 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:30.720
 what you can do in the vase faster world 

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:33.240
 become 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:35.460
 they were right of exhibitions flowers 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:37.439
 I do not have to do it in the garden 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:39.479
 I do it if I'm not too many 

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:40.680
 flowering like you have to borrow too 

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:42.869
 then cut out the withered ones 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:44.820
 cut away then they bloom more 

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:47.070
 you always believe you have to turn it all off 

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:49.020
 you should not let it all off 

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:51.180
 the more you cut dahlias the more 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:52.740
 If they bloom, they will believe you 

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:53.509
 you do not always believe you have to 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:55.890
 let me dare 

00:01:53.509 --> 00:01:57.750
 important is to cut a lot of italy 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:58.680
 one stimulates the budding picture and correct 

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:01.229
 right on 

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:03.299
 So as I said first, the pages 

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:05.130
 Remove flowers for longer styles 

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:06.509
 Second , they had to take away the faded 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:08.520
 definitely other flowers 

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:11.440
 Take away growth and blooming 

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:13.180
 to encourage for more floor 

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:15.120
 So more schmidt brings more 

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:19.110
 You can say flowers as well, yes 

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:19.110
 thanks a lot to Peter Hasler
