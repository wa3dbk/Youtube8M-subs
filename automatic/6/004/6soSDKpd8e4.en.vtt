direct web-based I think it's certainly

direct web-based I think it's certainly
you<00:03:29.510> know<00:03:29.600> evolved<00:03:30.170> a<00:03:30.470> lot<00:03:30.950> when<00:03:31.340> I<00:03:31.459> was

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:31.490 
you know evolved a lot when I was

00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:33.970 
you know evolved a lot when I was
starting<00:03:31.850> whirling<00:03:32.570> in<00:03:32.780> with<00:03:33.200> a<00:03:33.230> great<00:03:33.770> team

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:33.980 
starting whirling in with a great team

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:38.590 
starting whirling in with a great team
in<00:03:34.480> 2004<00:03:35.480> and<00:03:36.070> it<00:03:37.070> was<00:03:37.280> more<00:03:37.790> the<00:03:38.030> dogma<00:03:38.390> let's

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:38.600 
in 2004 and it was more the dogma let's

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:41.229 
in 2004 and it was more the dogma let's
say<00:03:38.720> I<00:03:38.780> think<00:03:39.080> that<00:03:39.230> has<00:03:39.380> evolved<00:03:39.769> a<00:03:40.400> long<00:03:41.000> way

00:03:41.229 --> 00:03:41.239 
say I think that has evolved a long way

00:03:41.239 --> 00:03:42.820 
say I think that has evolved a long way
and<00:03:41.450> it's<00:03:41.660> been<00:03:41.840> through<00:03:42.080> the<00:03:42.230> efforts<00:03:42.620> of

00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:42.830 
and it's been through the efforts of

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:44.650 
and it's been through the efforts of
both<00:03:42.860> some<00:03:43.550> low-cost<00:03:44.000> airlines<00:03:44.450> and

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:44.660 
both some low-cost airlines and

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:46.509 
both some low-cost airlines and
companies<00:03:45.590> like<00:03:45.739> a<00:03:45.800> Medeiros<00:03:46.130> that<00:03:46.280> have<00:03:46.400> you

00:03:46.509 --> 00:03:46.519 
companies like a Medeiros that have you

00:03:46.519 --> 00:03:48.460 
companies like a Medeiros that have you
know<00:03:46.550> evolved<00:03:46.970> which<00:03:47.630> used<00:03:48.050> to<00:03:48.080> be<00:03:48.200> much<00:03:48.320> more

00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:48.470 
know evolved which used to be much more

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:50.110 
know evolved which used to be much more
expensive<00:03:48.680> by<00:03:49.010> the<00:03:49.070> way<00:03:49.190> now<00:03:49.400> it's<00:03:49.550> much<00:03:49.940> more

00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:50.120 
expensive by the way now it's much more

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:52.480 
expensive by the way now it's much more
efficient
