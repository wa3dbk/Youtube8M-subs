are<00:02:06.240> skills<00:02:06.540> I<00:02:06.750> developed<00:02:06.810> at<00:02:07.409> her<00:02:07.770> tea

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:08.250 
are skills I developed at her tea

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:10.669 
are skills I developed at her tea
how<00:02:08.910> to<00:02:08.970> do<00:02:09.209> qualitative<00:02:09.840> research<00:02:10.229> how<00:02:10.410> to<00:02:10.470> do

00:02:10.669 --> 00:02:10.679 
how to do qualitative research how to do

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:12.619 
how to do qualitative research how to do
quantitative<00:02:11.340> research<00:02:11.730> how<00:02:11.940> to<00:02:11.970> depicted

00:02:12.619 --> 00:02:12.629 
quantitative research how to depicted

00:02:12.629 --> 00:02:13.170 
quantitative research how to depicted
then

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:13.180 
then

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:15.809 
then
to<00:02:13.299> produce<00:02:13.540> and<00:02:14.040> that<00:02:15.040> comes<00:02:15.340> on<00:02:15.549> very

00:02:15.809 --> 00:02:15.819 
to produce and that comes on very

00:02:15.819 --> 00:02:17.789 
to produce and that comes on very
strongly<00:02:16.180> I<00:02:16.359> think<00:02:16.719> in<00:02:16.840> any<00:02:17.079> work<00:02:17.349> that<00:02:17.650> most

00:02:17.789 --> 00:02:17.799 
strongly I think in any work that most

00:02:17.799 --> 00:02:22.650 
strongly I think in any work that most
of<00:02:18.040> us<00:02:18.189> would<00:02:18.400> be<00:02:18.579> doing<00:02:19.079> post<00:02:20.079> hurty
