00:00:03.760 --> 00:00:03.770 
if you're using a computer then you've

00:00:03.770 --> 00:00:06.130 
if you're using a computer then you've
probably<00:00:03.980> customized<00:00:04.880> it<00:00:05.180> just<00:00:05.479> for<00:00:05.750> you

00:00:06.130 --> 00:00:06.140 
probably customized it just for you

probably customized it just for you
they're<00:00:06.259> probably<00:00:06.580> specific<00:00:07.580> application

00:00:08.379 --> 00:00:08.389 
they're probably specific application

they're probably specific application
configurations<00:00:09.320> you<00:00:09.559> might<00:00:09.709> have<00:00:09.920> documents

00:00:10.510 --> 00:00:10.520 
configurations you might have documents

00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:11.890 
configurations you might have documents
that<00:00:10.580> you<00:00:10.789> have<00:00:10.910> stored<00:00:11.180> on<00:00:11.299> your<00:00:11.330> system

00:00:11.890 --> 00:00:11.900 
that you have stored on your system

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:13.779 
that you have stored on your system
maybe<00:00:12.350> there's<00:00:12.590> specialized<00:00:13.100> bookmarks<00:00:13.730> that

00:00:13.779 --> 00:00:13.789 
maybe there's specialized bookmarks that

00:00:13.789 --> 00:00:15.640 
maybe there's specialized bookmarks that
you've<00:00:14.059> created<00:00:14.360> on<00:00:14.629> to<00:00:14.840> your<00:00:14.990> computer<00:00:15.139> and

00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:15.650 
you've created on to your computer and

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:17.560 
you've created on to your computer and
if<00:00:16.039> you<00:00:16.160> move<00:00:16.369> from<00:00:16.520> one<00:00:16.609> computer<00:00:17.300> to<00:00:17.330> another

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:17.570 
if you move from one computer to another

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:20.170 
if you move from one computer to another
you<00:00:18.080> don't<00:00:18.260> want<00:00:18.530> to<00:00:18.650> lose<00:00:18.890> those<00:00:19.190> we<00:00:20.030> have

00:00:20.170 --> 00:00:20.180 
you don't want to lose those we have

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:21.820 
you don't want to lose those we have
gone<00:00:20.360> through<00:00:20.630> videos<00:00:20.960> before<00:00:21.290> where<00:00:21.680> we've

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:21.830 
gone through videos before where we've

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:24.370 
gone through videos before where we've
described<00:00:22.370> the<00:00:22.580> process<00:00:23.150> of<00:00:23.360> doing<00:00:23.660> upgrades

00:00:24.370 --> 00:00:24.380 
described the process of doing upgrades

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:27.070 
described the process of doing upgrades
where<00:00:24.710> you<00:00:25.039> put<00:00:25.250> in<00:00:25.430> an<00:00:25.810> installation<00:00:26.810> disk

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:27.080 
where you put in an installation disk

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:29.080 
where you put in an installation disk
and<00:00:27.289> it<00:00:27.440> simply<00:00:27.770> upgrades<00:00:28.340> a<00:00:28.460> system<00:00:28.880> all<00:00:29.030> in

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:29.090 
and it simply upgrades a system all in

00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:31.210 
and it simply upgrades a system all in
one<00:00:29.539> place<00:00:29.810> but<00:00:30.380> sometimes<00:00:30.800> you<00:00:30.920> don't<00:00:31.010> have

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:31.220 
one place but sometimes you don't have

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:32.799 
one place but sometimes you don't have
that<00:00:31.430> option<00:00:31.610> for<00:00:31.850> instance<00:00:32.360> if<00:00:32.480> you<00:00:32.570> want<00:00:32.750> to

00:00:32.799 --> 00:00:32.809 
that option for instance if you want to

00:00:32.809 --> 00:00:35.380 
that option for instance if you want to
go<00:00:32.899> from<00:00:33.050> Windows<00:00:33.410> XP<00:00:33.920> and<00:00:34.130> jump<00:00:34.489> to<00:00:34.610> Windows<00:00:34.940> 7

00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:35.390 
go from Windows XP and jump to Windows 7

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:38.170 
go from Windows XP and jump to Windows 7
there's<00:00:35.810> no<00:00:35.989> upgrade<00:00:36.530> between<00:00:37.040> those<00:00:37.310> two<00:00:37.579> so

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:38.180 
there's no upgrade between those two so

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:40.030 
there's no upgrade between those two so
you<00:00:38.239> have<00:00:38.450> to<00:00:38.600> find<00:00:38.810> some<00:00:39.110> way<00:00:39.290> to<00:00:39.320> migrate

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:40.040 
you have to find some way to migrate

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:42.819 
you have to find some way to migrate
that<00:00:40.250> data<00:00:40.310> between<00:00:41.270> Windows<00:00:41.660> XP<00:00:42.110> and<00:00:42.320> somehow

00:00:42.819 --> 00:00:42.829 
that data between Windows XP and somehow

00:00:42.829 --> 00:00:45.550 
that data between Windows XP and somehow
get<00:00:43.070> it<00:00:43.190> into<00:00:43.399> Windows<00:00:44.120> 7<00:00:44.570> there<00:00:45.020> may<00:00:45.200> also<00:00:45.350> be

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:45.560 
get it into Windows 7 there may also be

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:46.960 
get it into Windows 7 there may also be
a<00:00:45.710> time<00:00:45.980> where<00:00:46.160> you're<00:00:46.280> not<00:00:46.370> upgrading<00:00:46.880> the

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:46.970 
a time where you're not upgrading the

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:48.850 
a time where you're not upgrading the
same<00:00:47.180> computer<00:00:47.720> maybe<00:00:47.989> you're<00:00:48.200> changing<00:00:48.680> to<00:00:48.710> a

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:48.860 
same computer maybe you're changing to a

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:51.190 
same computer maybe you're changing to a
brand<00:00:49.280> new<00:00:49.399> system<00:00:49.790> so<00:00:50.450> in<00:00:50.600> that<00:00:50.720> case<00:00:51.020> you

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:51.200 
brand new system so in that case you

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:52.330 
brand new system so in that case you
can't<00:00:51.440> really<00:00:51.649> upgrade<00:00:52.190> the<00:00:52.309> operating

00:00:52.330 --> 00:00:52.340 
can't really upgrade the operating

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:54.459 
can't really upgrade the operating
system<00:00:53.090> either<00:00:53.270> you<00:00:53.780> need<00:00:53.930> to<00:00:54.170> move

00:00:54.459 --> 00:00:54.469 
system either you need to move

00:00:54.469 --> 00:00:56.709 
system either you need to move
everything<00:00:55.430> to<00:00:55.700> a<00:00:55.730> brand<00:00:56.149> new<00:00:56.420> computer

00:00:56.709 --> 00:00:56.719 
everything to a brand new computer

00:00:56.719 --> 00:00:58.900 
everything to a brand new computer
itself<00:00:57.590> and<00:00:57.920> if<00:00:58.250> you<00:00:58.370> run<00:00:58.550> into<00:00:58.700> those

00:00:58.900 --> 00:00:58.910 
itself and if you run into those

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:01.330 
itself and if you run into those
situations<00:00:59.149> you<00:00:59.780> might<00:00:59.989> want<00:01:00.260> to<00:01:00.350> use<00:01:00.680> some<00:01:01.219> of

00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:01.340 
situations you might want to use some of

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:03.040 
situations you might want to use some of
those<00:01:01.489> migration<00:01:02.210> tools<00:01:02.450> that<00:01:02.660> are<00:01:02.780> built

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:03.050 
those migration tools that are built

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:06.010 
those migration tools that are built
into<00:01:03.410> Microsoft<00:01:03.739> Windows<00:01:04.549> if<00:01:05.509> you're

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:06.020 
into Microsoft Windows if you're

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:08.020 
into Microsoft Windows if you're
migrating<00:01:06.229> from<00:01:06.679> one<00:01:06.770> physical<00:01:07.130> computer<00:01:07.850> to

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:08.030 
migrating from one physical computer to

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:10.029 
migrating from one physical computer to
another<00:01:08.270> physical<00:01:08.899> computer<00:01:09.409> you<00:01:09.799> can<00:01:09.950> do

00:01:10.029 --> 00:01:10.039 
another physical computer you can do

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:11.679 
another physical computer you can do
what's<00:01:10.249> called<00:01:10.310> a<00:01:10.670> side-by-side<00:01:11.030> migration

00:01:11.679 --> 00:01:11.689 
what's called a side-by-side migration

00:01:11.689 --> 00:01:13.660 
what's called a side-by-side migration
you've<00:01:12.319> got<00:01:12.469> both<00:01:12.679> computers<00:01:13.219> there<00:01:13.429> they're

00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:13.670 
you've got both computers there they're

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:16.270 
you've got both computers there they're
turned<00:01:13.999> on<00:01:14.270> at<00:01:14.600> exactly<00:01:14.719> the<00:01:15.259> same<00:01:15.469> time<00:01:15.530> you

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:16.280 
turned on at exactly the same time you

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:18.039 
turned on at exactly the same time you
can<00:01:16.490> connect<00:01:16.909> them<00:01:17.119> with<00:01:17.329> a<00:01:17.389> specialized

00:01:18.039 --> 00:01:18.049 
can connect them with a specialized

00:01:18.049 --> 00:01:19.870 
can connect them with a specialized
transfer<00:01:18.740> cable<00:01:19.009> so<00:01:19.399> you<00:01:19.490> can<00:01:19.670> send

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:19.880 
transfer cable so you can send

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:22.330 
transfer cable so you can send
information<00:01:20.179> between<00:01:20.959> the<00:01:21.380> two<00:01:21.409> and<00:01:21.859> it<00:01:22.219> will

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:22.340 
information between the two and it will

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:24.129 
information between the two and it will
simply<00:01:22.549> move<00:01:22.939> information<00:01:23.209> from<00:01:23.899> one

00:01:24.129 --> 00:01:24.139 
simply move information from one

00:01:24.139 --> 00:01:26.440 
simply move information from one
computer<00:01:24.170> to<00:01:24.709> another<00:01:24.939> another<00:01:25.939> type<00:01:26.270> of

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:26.450 
computer to another another type of

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:28.539 
computer to another another type of
migration<00:01:26.630> is<00:01:27.170> called<00:01:27.409> a<00:01:27.590> wipe<00:01:27.950> and<00:01:28.159> load

00:01:28.539 --> 00:01:28.549 
migration is called a wipe and load

00:01:28.549 --> 00:01:30.999 
migration is called a wipe and load
that's<00:01:29.090> where<00:01:29.329> you<00:01:29.539> are<00:01:29.569> taking<00:01:30.170> all<00:01:30.619> of<00:01:30.829> the

two-step process to be able to perform
these<00:04:39.100> migrations<00:04:39.880> the<00:04:40.449> first<00:04:40.780> step<00:04:41.050> is<00:04:41.260> to<00:04:41.500> do

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:41.590 
these migrations the first step is to do

00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:44.129 
these migrations the first step is to do
something<00:04:42.010> called<00:04:42.220> a<00:04:42.460> scan<00:04:43.210> state<00:04:43.720> which<00:04:43.990> is

00:04:44.129 --> 00:04:44.139 
something called a scan state which is

00:04:44.139 --> 00:04:46.290 
something called a scan state which is
going<00:04:44.260> to<00:04:44.320> take<00:04:44.500> all<00:04:44.740> of<00:04:44.800> your<00:04:45.280> data<00:04:45.580> and<00:04:45.880> it's

00:04:46.290 --> 00:04:46.300 
going to take all of your data and it's

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:48.000 
going to take all of your data and it's
going<00:04:46.419> to<00:04:46.510> compile<00:04:46.870> it<00:04:47.020> all<00:04:47.199> together<00:04:47.560> and

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:48.010 
going to compile it all together and

00:04:48.010 --> 00:04:50.280 
going to compile it all together and
store<00:04:48.550> that<00:04:48.580> somewhere<00:04:49.449> else<00:04:49.630> so<00:04:49.870> you<00:04:49.930> have<00:04:50.139> to

00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:50.290 
store that somewhere else so you have to

00:04:50.290 --> 00:04:52.920 
store that somewhere else so you have to
be<00:04:50.410> running<00:04:50.680> as<00:04:50.919> an<00:04:51.580> elevated<00:04:52.270> prompt<00:04:52.780> in

00:04:59.940 --> 00:04:59.950 
XP once that information has been

00:04:59.950 --> 00:05:02.129 
XP once that information has been
scanned<00:05:00.430> and<00:05:00.639> stored<00:05:00.850> elsewhere<00:05:01.240> you<00:05:02.110> can

00:05:02.129 --> 00:05:02.139 
scanned and stored elsewhere you can

00:05:02.139 --> 00:05:04.770 
scanned and stored elsewhere you can
then<00:05:02.560> load<00:05:03.220> it<00:05:03.400> into<00:05:03.610> the<00:05:03.880> new<00:05:04.300> operating

00:05:04.770 --> 00:05:04.780 
then load it into the new operating

00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:06.840 
then load it into the new operating
system<00:05:05.290> the<00:05:05.530> second<00:05:05.950> step<00:05:06.190> would<00:05:06.430> be<00:05:06.490> to

00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:06.850 
system the second step would be to

00:05:06.850 --> 00:05:08.909 
system the second step would be to
perform<00:05:07.060> a<00:05:07.479> load<00:05:07.870> State<00:05:08.229> where<00:05:08.560> we're<00:05:08.740> taking

00:05:08.909 --> 00:05:08.919 
perform a load State where we're taking

00:05:08.919 --> 00:05:10.920 
perform a load State where we're taking
all<00:05:09.310> of<00:05:09.370> that<00:05:09.610> profile<00:05:10.150> information<00:05:10.450> that

00:05:10.920 --> 00:05:10.930 
all of that profile information that

00:05:10.930 --> 00:05:12.930 
all of that profile information that
we've<00:05:11.050> saved<00:05:11.320> elsewhere<00:05:11.860> and<00:05:12.040> we're<00:05:12.580> loading

00:05:12.930 --> 00:05:12.940 
we've saved elsewhere and we're loading

00:05:12.940 --> 00:05:15.960 
we've saved elsewhere and we're loading
it<00:05:13.210> into<00:05:13.750> our<00:05:14.020> new<00:05:14.260> operating<00:05:14.650> system<00:05:15.340> so<00:05:15.789> by

00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:15.970 
it into our new operating system so by

00:05:15.970 --> 00:05:18.540 
it into our new operating system so by
combining<00:05:16.479> this<00:05:16.750> capability<00:05:16.960> of<00:05:17.560> using<00:05:18.070> scan

00:05:18.540 --> 00:05:18.550
