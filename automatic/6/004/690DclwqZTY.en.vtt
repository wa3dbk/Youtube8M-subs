00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:58.290 
very it's way better than plastic man
for<00:02:56.500> size<00:02:56.740> comparison<00:02:56.910> here's<00:02:57.910> next<00:02:58.210> to

00:02:58.290 --> 00:02:58.300 
for size comparison here's next to

00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:02.820 
for size comparison here's next to
Plastic<00:02:58.720> Man<00:02:59.790> Plastic<00:03:00.790> Man<00:03:00.820> and<00:03:01.600> then<00:03:02.140> they're

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:02.830 
Plastic Man Plastic Man and then they're

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:05.790 
Plastic Man Plastic Man and then they're
the<00:03:02.980> same<00:03:03.160> size<00:03:03.220> and<00:03:03.820> I'd<00:03:04.750> say<00:03:04.959> Plastic<00:03:05.440> Man<00:03:05.470> is

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:05.800 
the same size and I'd say Plastic Man is

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:08.640 
the same size and I'd say Plastic Man is
just<00:03:06.040> a<00:03:06.160> snitch<00:03:06.550> taller<00:03:06.970> or<00:03:07.930> maybe<00:03:08.200> in<00:03:08.410> to

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:08.650 
just a snitch taller or maybe in to

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:10.800 
just a snitch taller or maybe in to
snitches<00:03:09.160> two<00:03:09.520> or<00:03:09.700> three<00:03:10.000> snitches<00:03:10.510> taller

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:10.810 
snitches two or three snitches taller

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:16.110 
snitches two or three snitches taller
than<00:03:11.110> blue<00:03:11.830> beetle<00:03:12.570> now<00:03:14.640> the<00:03:15.640> other<00:03:15.670> leg

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:16.120 
than blue beetle now the other leg

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:19.680 
than blue beetle now the other leg
doesn't<00:03:16.360> act<00:03:16.600> activate<00:03:17.320> but<00:03:17.530> only<00:03:18.040> the<00:03:18.690> left

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:19.690 
doesn't act activate but only the left

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:23.490 
doesn't act activate but only the left
leg<00:03:19.959> does<00:03:20.260> and<00:03:20.880> his<00:03:21.880> arms<00:03:22.209> can<00:03:22.390> rotate<00:03:22.500> his

00:03:23.490 --> 00:03:23.500 
leg does and his arms can rotate his

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:27.420 
leg does and his arms can rotate his
head<00:03:23.530> can<00:03:24.070> rotate<00:03:24.520> no<00:03:25.860> and<00:03:26.860> his<00:03:27.040> arms<00:03:27.280> can

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:27.430 
head can rotate no and his arms can

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:30.900 
head can rotate no and his arms can
rotate<00:03:27.489> and<00:03:28.090> his<00:03:28.260> legs<00:03:29.260> can<00:03:29.410> rotate<00:03:29.980> but<00:03:30.340> this

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:30.910 
rotate and his legs can rotate but this

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:32.310 
rotate and his legs can rotate but this
like<00:03:31.270> can't<00:03:31.540> because<00:03:31.870> it<00:03:31.989> has<00:03:32.110> a<00:03:32.140> little

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:32.320 
like can't because it has a little

00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:37.260

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:02.320 
protect on the leg from being messed up

00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:06.750 
protect on the leg from being messed up
I<00:04:03.220> would<00:04:03.760> prefer<00:04:03.790> doing<00:04:04.330> that<00:04:04.690> because<00:04:05.609> so<00:04:06.609> the

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:06.760 
I would prefer doing that because so the

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:08.460 
I would prefer doing that because so the
leg<00:04:06.940> will<00:04:07.180> get<00:04:07.390> messed<00:04:07.660> up<00:04:07.900> it<00:04:08.170> will<00:04:08.320> protect

00:04:08.460 --> 00:04:08.470 
leg will get messed up it will protect

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:10.830 
leg will get messed up it will protect
it<00:04:08.890> from

00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:10.840 
it from

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:13.990 
it from
be<00:04:11.840> messed<00:04:12.140> up<00:04:12.380> and<00:04:12.680> it's<00:04:13.430> kind<00:04:13.730> of<00:04:13.760> hard<00:04:13.940> to

00:04:13.990 --> 00:04:14.000 
be messed up and it's kind of hard to

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:17.830 
be messed up and it's kind of hard to
explain<00:04:14.090> I<00:04:14.569> guess<00:04:14.830> all<00:04:15.830> right<00:04:16.040> now<00:04:16.840> that's

00:04:17.830 --> 00:04:17.840 
explain I guess all right now that's

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:19.360 
explain I guess all right now that's
clean<00:04:18.079> the<00:04:18.350> and<00:04:18.560> thank<00:04:18.980> you<00:04:19.130> guys<00:04:19.310> for
