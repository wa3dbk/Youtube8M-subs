simple<00:02:38.299> enough<00:02:38.420> it<00:02:38.750> comes<00:02:38.930> apart<00:02:39.230> with<00:02:39.470> some

00:02:40.089 --> 00:02:40.099 
simple enough it comes apart with some

00:02:40.099 --> 00:02:41.740 
simple enough it comes apart with some

00:02:43.149 --> 00:02:43.159 
probably just sand it all off and

00:02:43.159 --> 00:02:45.069 
probably just sand it all off and
repaint<00:02:43.579> it<00:02:43.700> and<00:02:43.760> order<00:02:44.389> a<00:02:44.420> coat<00:02:44.689> it<00:02:44.840> or<00:02:44.959> do

reason I've been able to do that is

00:03:59.229 --> 00:04:02.080 
reason I've been able to do that is
because<00:04:00.229> I<00:04:00.530> carry<00:04:01.129> this<00:04:01.310> thing<00:04:01.549> that<00:04:01.849> I<00:04:01.879> can

because I carry this thing that I can

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:04.119 
because I carry this thing that I can
just<00:04:02.269> kind<00:04:02.299> of<00:04:02.510> beat<00:04:02.720> on<00:04:02.900> and<00:04:03.169> not<00:04:03.680> really<00:04:03.919> care
