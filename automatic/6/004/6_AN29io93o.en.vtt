00:02:55.449 --> 00:02:55.459 
half again and then fold it in 1/4

00:02:55.459 --> 00:02:57.610 
half again and then fold it in 1/4
because<00:02:55.760> what<00:02:56.060> you're<00:02:56.180> trying<00:02:56.359> to<00:02:56.569> do<00:02:56.720> is<00:02:57.319> find

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:01.670 
the center of the flower so you can

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:06.009 
the center of the flower so you can
little<00:03:01.819> snip<00:03:03.310> take<00:03:04.310> your<00:03:04.489> pipe<00:03:04.670> cleaner<00:03:05.030> and

take your bead I'm gonna take a bead

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:11.339 
take your bead I'm gonna take a bead
that<00:03:08.720> um<00:03:09.319> I<00:03:09.709> had<00:03:10.190> done<00:03:10.340> in<00:03:10.489> a<00:03:10.549> previous<00:03:10.910> video

00:03:11.339 --> 00:03:11.349 
that um I had done in a previous video

00:03:11.349 --> 00:03:17.620 
that um I had done in a previous video
with<00:03:12.349> the<00:03:12.440> marbling<00:03:12.829> put<00:03:13.760> your<00:03:16.359> pipe<00:03:17.359> cleaner

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:17.630 
with the marbling put your pipe cleaner

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:19.030 
with the marbling put your pipe cleaner
through<00:03:17.720> there<00:03:18.049> and<00:03:18.290> you<00:03:18.380> want<00:03:18.560> to<00:03:18.620> fold<00:03:18.829> it

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:19.040 
through there and you want to fold it

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:22.030 
through there and you want to fold it
like<00:03:19.280> this<00:03:20.030> and<00:03:20.329> then<00:03:20.630> have<00:03:20.900> done<00:03:21.230> the<00:03:21.799> two

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:22.040 
like this and then have done the two

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:25.170 
like this and then have done the two
pieces<00:03:22.549> of<00:03:22.579> the<00:03:23.319> the<00:03:24.319> pipe<00:03:24.530> cleaner<00:03:24.859> meet

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:25.180 
pieces of the the pipe cleaner meet

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:28.589 
pieces of the the pipe cleaner meet
underneath<00:03:26.180> into<00:03:26.450> the<00:03:26.660> middle<00:03:26.900> of<00:03:27.079> that<00:03:27.319> so

00:03:28.589 --> 00:03:28.599 
underneath into the middle of that so

00:03:28.599 --> 00:03:31.000 
underneath into the middle of that so
this<00:03:29.599> is<00:03:29.780> you<00:03:29.930> a<00:03:29.959> bigger<00:03:30.349> bead<00:03:30.709> than<00:03:30.919> I

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:31.010 
this is you a bigger bead than I

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:37.120 
this is you a bigger bead than I
normally<00:03:31.069> use<00:03:31.489> so<00:03:32.209> we'll<00:03:32.389> see<00:03:32.540> how<00:03:32.750> it<00:03:32.930> looks

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:37.130 

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:39.940 

okay<00:03:37.940> and<00:03:38.210> then<00:03:38.540> you<00:03:38.660> find<00:03:38.930> your<00:03:39.110> opening<00:03:39.560> and

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:39.950 
okay and then you find your opening and

00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:42.070 
okay and then you find your opening and
you<00:03:40.250> feed<00:03:40.460> it<00:03:40.610> through<00:03:40.690> all<00:03:41.690> the<00:03:41.780> way<00:03:41.870> through

00:03:42.070 --> 00:03:42.080 
you feed it through all the way through

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:45.370 
you feed it through all the way through
that's<00:03:42.290> why<00:03:42.470> you<00:03:42.530> need<00:03:42.830> it<00:03:42.950> twisted<00:03:43.370> good<00:03:44.380> and

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:45.380 
that's why you need it twisted good and

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:47.260 
that's why you need it twisted good and
now's<00:03:45.680> the<00:03:45.860> time<00:03:46.070> where<00:03:46.370> I<00:03:46.400> would<00:03:46.550> end<00:03:46.970> up

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:47.270 
now's the time where I would end up

00:03:47.270 --> 00:03:49.090 
now's the time where I would end up
spreading<00:03:47.720> the<00:03:47.840> leaves<00:03:48.050> a<00:03:48.230> little<00:03:48.470> bit<00:03:48.620> kind

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:49.100 
spreading the leaves a little bit kind

00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:56.680 
spreading the leaves a little bit kind
of<00:03:49.720> moving<00:03:50.720> them<00:03:50.840> around<00:03:54.940> so<00:03:55.940> they're<00:03:56.090> all<00:03:56.210> not

00:03:56.680 --> 00:03:56.690 
of moving them around so they're all not

00:03:56.690 --> 00:04:01.839 
of moving them around so they're all not
in<00:03:56.900> the<00:03:57.020> same<00:03:57.260> exact<00:03:57.620> spot

00:04:01.839 --> 00:04:01.849 

00:04:01.849 --> 00:04:07.179 

see<00:04:02.329> that<00:04:04.239> okay<00:04:05.239> the<00:04:05.840> next<00:04:06.049> step<00:04:06.170> is<00:04:06.650> take<00:04:07.159> a

00:04:07.179 --> 00:04:07.189 
see that okay the next step is take a

00:04:07.189 --> 00:04:09.399 
see that okay the next step is take a
little<00:04:07.400> bit<00:04:07.489> of<00:04:07.549> hot<00:04:07.760> glue<00:04:07.969> and<00:04:08.359> you're<00:04:08.900> around

00:04:09.399 --> 00:04:09.409 
little bit of hot glue and you're around

00:04:09.409 --> 00:04:11.170 
little bit of hot glue and you're around
the<00:04:09.650> middle<00:04:09.980> you're<00:04:10.280> going<00:04:10.489> to<00:04:10.549> want<00:04:10.760> to<00:04:10.879> run<00:04:11.120> a

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:11.180 
the middle you're going to want to run a

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:13.809 
the middle you're going to want to run a
bead<00:04:11.480> of<00:04:11.540> glue<00:04:11.920> and<00:04:12.920> this<00:04:13.040> is<00:04:13.219> basically<00:04:13.700> just

00:04:13.809 --> 00:04:13.819 
bead of glue and this is basically just

00:04:13.819 --> 00:04:18.039 
bead of glue and this is basically just
to<00:04:14.180> hold<00:04:14.390> everything<00:04:14.719> in<00:04:15.170> place<00:04:16.840> so<00:04:17.840> things

00:04:18.039 --> 00:04:18.049 
to hold everything in place so things

00:04:18.049 --> 00:04:20.550 
to hold everything in place so things
don't<00:04:18.259> slip<00:04:18.560> out<00:04:18.680> or<00:04:18.979> things<00:04:19.190> don't<00:04:19.430> tear<00:04:19.699> out

00:04:20.550 --> 00:04:20.560 
don't slip out or things don't tear out

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:23.650 
don't slip out or things don't tear out
so<00:04:21.560> go<00:04:21.769> ahead<00:04:21.829> and<00:04:22.160> just<00:04:22.520> run<00:04:22.729> it<00:04:22.880> around<00:04:23.000> and

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:23.660 
so go ahead and just run it around and

00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:27.490 
so go ahead and just run it around and
then<00:04:24.259> take<00:04:24.650> take<00:04:25.460> some<00:04:25.639> glitter<00:04:26.350> put<00:04:27.350> it<00:04:27.410> on

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:27.500 
then take take some glitter put it on

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:34.480 
then take take some glitter put it on
there<00:04:27.830> and<00:04:31.570> then<00:04:33.070> you're<00:04:34.070> gonna<00:04:34.190> let<00:04:34.430> that

00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:34.490 
there and then you're gonna let that

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:36.999 
there and then you're gonna let that
cool<00:04:35.300> a<00:04:35.360> little<00:04:35.570> bit<00:04:35.720> and<00:04:36.320> you're<00:04:36.560> gonna<00:04:36.650> shake

00:04:36.999 --> 00:04:37.009 
cool a little bit and you're gonna shake

00:04:37.009 --> 00:04:41.560 
cool a little bit and you're gonna shake
off<00:04:37.340> any<00:04:37.639> excess<00:04:38.120> glitter<00:04:40.210> and<00:04:41.210> of<00:04:41.360> course

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:41.570 
off any excess glitter and of course

00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:44.080 
off any excess glitter and of course
that<00:04:41.720> access<00:04:42.139> can<00:04:42.320> always<00:04:42.530> go<00:04:42.680> back<00:04:42.880> to<00:04:43.880> use

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:44.090 
that access can always go back to use

00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:48.549 
that access can always go back to use
for<00:04:44.300> a<00:04:44.360> different<00:04:44.630> project

00:04:48.549 --> 00:04:48.559 

00:04:48.559 --> 00:04:50.799 

okay<00:04:49.129> so<00:04:49.429> when<00:04:49.789> it's<00:04:49.969> dry<00:04:50.179> that's<00:04:50.479> what<00:04:50.689> it

00:04:50.799 --> 00:04:50.809 
okay so when it's dry that's what it

00:04:50.809 --> 00:04:52.389 
okay so when it's dry that's what it
will<00:04:50.959> look<00:04:51.079> like<00:04:51.139> and<00:04:51.589> then<00:04:52.129> you're<00:04:52.249> going<00:04:52.339> to

00:04:52.389 --> 00:04:52.399 
will look like and then you're going to

00:04:52.399 --> 00:04:53.739 
will look like and then you're going to
want<00:04:52.579> to<00:04:52.729> flip<00:04:52.849> it<00:04:52.999> over<00:04:53.119> and<00:04:53.299> do<00:04:53.449> the<00:04:53.539> same

00:04:53.739 --> 00:04:53.749 
want to flip it over and do the same

00:04:53.749 --> 00:04:56.949 
want to flip it over and do the same
thing<00:04:53.959> here<00:04:54.169> otherwise<00:04:55.119> the<00:04:56.119> tissue<00:04:56.839> paper

00:04:56.949 --> 00:04:56.959 
thing here otherwise the tissue paper

00:04:56.959 --> 00:05:02.739 
thing here otherwise the tissue paper
will<00:04:57.529> will<00:04:58.429> slide<00:04:58.729> right<00:04:58.759> off<00:04:59.229> so<00:05:01.569> okay<00:05:02.569> now

00:05:02.739 --> 00:05:02.749 
will will slide right off so okay now

00:05:02.749 --> 00:05:04.239 
will will slide right off so okay now
that<00:05:03.079> everything's<00:05:03.469> cooled<00:05:03.799> all<00:05:04.099> you're

00:05:04.239 --> 00:05:04.249 
that everything's cooled all you're

00:05:04.249 --> 00:05:08.349 
that everything's cooled all you're
going<00:05:04.369> to<00:05:04.429> do<00:05:04.609> is<00:05:04.819> take<00:05:05.059> each<00:05:05.299> piece<00:05:06.019> of<00:05:07.359> tissue

00:05:08.349 --> 00:05:08.359 
going to do is take each piece of tissue

00:05:08.359 --> 00:05:11.019 
going to do is take each piece of tissue
paper<00:05:08.509> and<00:05:08.959> squish<00:05:09.469> it<00:05:09.649> up<00:05:09.799> around<00:05:10.309> the<00:05:10.639> center

00:05:11.019 --> 00:05:11.029 
paper and squish it up around the center

00:05:11.029 --> 00:05:15.369 
paper and squish it up around the center
