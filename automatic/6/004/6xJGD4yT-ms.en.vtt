00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:10.469
 the aegon future journal of this 

00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:13.049
 soak soon with the a2 of aex in the mini 

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:16.410
 classic against feyenoord a2 now first 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:19.140
 the e2 of ajax against dvs e1 with here the 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:22.080
 first part of the competition comes on already 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:26.960
 van let Klaassen the boss of backwards 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:31.500
 of new profile rack and it is a zero 

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:34.500
 then tbs in the attack 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:36.960
 this number 20 may just have to go through 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:40.129
 intervention of the prince is not good 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:40.129
 and it's one thing 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:46.980
 many goals this duel fall here 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:50.940
 the two becomes a nice free kick from 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:52.710
 far in the goal of nigel eye look 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:55.170
 that was three goals in the 1st half 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:56.879
 in the second half there would still be 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:59.729
 eight at here come the shot 

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:02.819
 distance that is blown into Wajo Bobson and luc 

00:00:59.729 --> 00:01:04.440
 with his second of the competition 

00:01:02.819 --> 00:01:09.110
 easy tag but he counts 

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:09.110
 naturally boxing again 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:15.030
 son of kevin bobson who is there vario 

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:18.110
 shot eventually ends up at 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:21.550
 ambitious axel dongen 

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:21.550
 there it is 4th 

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:31.790
 You two from Ajax had a good match 

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:33.770
 played against dvs e1 

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:35.750
 here again a shot from a distance again the 

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:37.010
 tilt that you are not comfortable with and again 

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:39.979
 is it about one 

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:41.960
 who can tap from close by 5 a 

00:01:39.979 --> 00:01:46.250
 and on his second of the competition 

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:48.530
 tms also gives something back as the tip 

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:55.310
 bars set for wrong and the 5th 

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:57.770
 being that was the last of dbs 

00:01:55.310 --> 00:02:00.320
 again it is Ajax's boss 

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:04.580
 quaedvlieg ends up at daan yo 

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:06.560
 ruperti and he made 6 2 of it 

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:09.380
 that was a ruperti with a relative 

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:11.959
 easy goal this is ruperti again 

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:15.050
 great shot with a beautiful goal 

00:02:11.959 --> 00:02:16.400
 the far corner there goes milio luberti 

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:19.550
 just like his teammate 

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:21.290
 julian burners for the goal from 

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:22.790
 the month with this unlikely 

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:25.580
 to meet 

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:27.440
 burners who won the patty in August 

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:28.549
 certainly goes along with the election 

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:31.040
 September 

00:02:28.549 --> 00:02:33.739
 here it is ruperti again and another one 

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:35.360
 charity 3 goals range of one 

00:02:33.739 --> 00:02:37.310
 number 10 

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:39.830
 weather quaedvlieg here has the will one 

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:43.450
 couple assist and now scores themselves and such 

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:43.450
 game ended in 9 2 

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:47.720
 we move on to the a2 of ajax such as 

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:49.940
 said to feyenoord a2 

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:51.920
 on the future and here the first 

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:54.350
 good evening of the competition 

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:57.980
 and immediately it is a goal this is 

00:02:54.350 --> 00:03:01.250
 Jeff are associated with the one zero 

00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:03.440
 getting into suffering is not 

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:05.150
 well and man osama is completely free and 

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:07.310
 Jannie disguised the goalkeeper 

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:08.270
 is a hopeless lot of feyenoord 

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:11.470
 lead 

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:11.470
 on this f malfidus 

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:19.850
 les marines ajax accurately adheres to the 

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:22.280
 attack via bruijn vof nice feed is then 

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:25.250
 the cross towards Ezra Walian the striker 

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:27.680
 and that is called a beautiful goal look now 

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:30.040
 what a goal of the number 9 of the 

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:30.040
 a tree 

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:38.300
 this striker scores so easily 

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:42.050
 and this is a very good goal 

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:44.690
 this the ball over sem of the arrow and 

00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:48.040
 tim van der linden has passed in that 

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:48.040
 checkmarks to train the a2 

00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:54.040
 is feyenoord and the attack 

00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:58.879
 brown takes over and proceeds balian type with 

00:03:56.750 --> 00:04:01.340
 a wonderful depth boss it done 

00:03:58.879 --> 00:04:03.980
 balian about the goalkeeper over from the linden 

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:04.760
 but variant is knocked down and 

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:07.190
 that means 

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:08.989
 red for van der linden Feyenoord not 

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:10.160
 continue with ten men 

00:04:08.989 --> 00:04:12.190
 justified decision of the 

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:12.190
 referee 

00:04:14.830 --> 00:04:18.310
 the free kick ultimately delivers nothing 

00:04:16.450 --> 00:04:20.919
 on 

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:24.730
 ajax with the man again so on the hunt for 

00:04:20.919 --> 00:04:27.210
 the lead but it's feyenoord with 

00:04:24.730 --> 00:04:29.080
 the first big chance after the red card 

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:30.700
 uncertainty here between milan 

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:31.900
 fashion week ankie the mill disguised 

00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:33.430
 slip 

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:35.950
 rick van der struijs then shoots the ball 

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:38.590
 the inside of the pole and the a2 of 

00:04:35.950 --> 00:04:40.980
 Ajax escapes ability has pain can 

00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:40.980
 well beyond that 

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:46.990
 this one of the struijs must make the two 

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:49.120
 for feyenoord ajax the ball is then again 

00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:49.900
 lost quickly because feyenoord has it here 

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:51.639
 again 

00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:53.050
 and here it is quite expensive 

00:04:51.639 --> 00:04:55.540
 albertus 

00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:56.260
 and albertus 1 to 1 is disguised 

00:04:55.540 --> 00:04:59.280
 the goal 

00:04:56.260 --> 00:04:59.280
 2nd for feyenoord 

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:08.620
 organization away from the a2 and the 

00:05:02.350 --> 00:05:10.150
 backlog also against 10 men so zakaria 

00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:11.800
 el azzouzi captain 

00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:13.780
 gives the ball to tamil thanks 

00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:16.930
 thanksgiving sounds ahead 

00:05:13.780 --> 00:05:19.720
 no balian but el azzouzi immediately after the 

00:05:16.930 --> 00:05:21.460
 2e of feyenoord is the 222 

00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:23.169
 but I was also the last chance of the 

00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:23.950
 competition and that's how this mini ends 

00:05:23.169 --> 00:05:26.370
 classic 

00:05:23.950 --> 00:05:26.370
 in a draw
