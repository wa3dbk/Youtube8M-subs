00:00:00.590 --> 00:00:07.710
 very raw 

00:00:04.510 --> 00:00:09.750
 welcome to live 

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:11.400
 Here I bring you another seed for the 

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:13.500
 generation of the world this time I bring you 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:16.260
 the ice cream seed as you see the 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:18.720
 first it was capitalized and makes it 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:21.240
 cream is also capitalized to have it 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:23.640
 in account and good is a seed 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:24.989
 quite peculiar something very very different 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:28.079
 to what we have seen in other seeds 

00:00:24.989 --> 00:00:30.899
 as you are going to see has a quantity of 

00:00:28.079 --> 00:00:33.270
 impressive plains that is land 

00:00:30.899 --> 00:00:35.790
 very very very flat as you are going to see and 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:37.530
 how are you seeing there of materials 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:39.989
 it is well seasoned the seed is 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:41.489
 pretty cool has enough wood 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:44.309
 pretty natural games as you see 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:46.679
 there is also a lot of stone and good is 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:49.350
 what is different about this seed is that it is 

00:00:46.679 --> 00:00:52.109
 pretty pretty plain there's hardly 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:55.140
 mountains and mountains there are very 

00:00:52.109 --> 00:00:56.940
 little elevated and good is simply what 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:58.350
 I bring for the difference because 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:00.749
 we are always like living 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:01.499
 mountain seeds and others and the truth 

00:01:00.749 --> 00:01:03.600
 is that it has caught my attention 

00:01:01.499 --> 00:01:06.000
 simply because it's simpler and has 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:07.710
 a lot of flipflops yes 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.170
 above all valleys as you can see there between 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:13.570
 mountains there is quite valley and above all 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:16.040
 very flat ground that for certain 

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:18.170
 well there are also natural caves by 

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:20.600
 there as you see and well, it has simply 

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:22.430
 surprised by the subject this I tell you 

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:24.860
 that is a land especially very very 

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:27.590
 very very flat and good also has 

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:30.050
 snow areas as you are going to see out there and 

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:31.640
 the truth is that it is great simply 

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:33.170
 I would tell you to take a look at it 

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:35.240
 for certain constructions these 

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:36.950
 such flat lands will help us and 

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:39.890
 well just share it with 

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:41.480
 your friends who will thank you and me 

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:42.710
 I would give a positive vote to this seed 

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:45.800
 because it has caught my attention 

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:48.310
 is very different from the others and give it a 

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:51.200
 like if you liked it and su for next 

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:53.360
 videos so nothing with this live 

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:56.120
 saying goodbye or just trying this 

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:57.920
 seed that is worth it and nothing a 

00:01:56.120 --> 00:02:00.550
