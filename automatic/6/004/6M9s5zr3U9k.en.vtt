your scalpel Oh bring it on in I curve

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:35.590 
your scalpel Oh bring it on in I curve
it<00:03:33.650> down<00:03:33.799> a<00:03:33.830> little<00:03:34.150> are<00:03:35.150> we<00:03:35.209> going<00:03:35.360> through

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:35.600 
it down a little are we going through

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:37.120 
it down a little are we going through
those<00:03:35.690> main<00:03:35.959> arteries<00:03:36.320> or<00:03:36.440> they<00:03:36.680> may<00:03:36.860> ya

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:37.130 
those main arteries or they may ya

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:39.009 
those main arteries or they may ya
ordered<00:03:37.580> right<00:03:37.670> here<00:03:37.910> you<00:03:38.570> cut<00:03:38.810> them<00:03:38.930> up

00:03:39.009 --> 00:03:39.019 
ordered right here you cut them up

00:03:39.019 --> 00:03:42.550 
ordered right here you cut them up
you'll<00:03:39.470> see<00:03:39.650> that<00:03:39.769> they<00:03:39.920> slice<00:03:40.600> them<00:03:41.600> in<00:03:42.380> this

00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:42.560 
you'll see that they slice them in this

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:49.569 
you'll see that they slice them in this
slice<00:03:47.769> then<00:03:48.769> you<00:03:48.860> can<00:03:48.980> tell<00:03:49.130> that<00:03:49.160> the<00:03:49.340> heart

00:03:49.569 --> 00:03:49.579 
slice then you can tell that the heart

00:03:49.579 --> 00:03:51.330 
slice then you can tell that the heart
is<00:03:49.670> still<00:03:49.880> beating<00:03:50.090> so<00:03:50.390> you<00:03:50.450> can't<00:03:50.630> go<00:03:50.750> like

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:51.340 
is still beating so you can't go like

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:57.460 
is still beating so you can't go like
get<00:03:52.340> in<00:03:52.459> there<00:03:52.579> and<00:03:52.610> let's<00:03:52.880> slice<00:03:53.269> it<00:03:53.480> up<00:03:56.470> just

00:03:57.460 --> 00:03:57.470 
get in there and let's slice it up just

00:03:57.470 --> 00:04:03.009 
get in there and let's slice it up just
like<00:03:57.680> that<00:03:58.989> stop<00:03:59.989> beating<00:04:01.329> we<00:04:02.329> can<00:04:02.510> go<00:04:02.630> in<00:04:02.870> and

00:04:03.009 --> 00:04:03.019 
like that stop beating we can go in and

00:04:03.019 --> 00:04:08.800 
like that stop beating we can go in and
treat<00:04:03.860> it<00:04:05.980> really<00:04:06.980> simple<00:04:07.459> actually<00:04:08.090> not

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:08.810 
treat it really simple actually not

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:11.650 
treat it really simple actually not
simple<00:04:09.170> at<00:04:09.230> all<00:04:09.380> goes<00:04:09.880> art<00:04:10.880> never<00:04:11.150> wants<00:04:11.510> to<00:04:11.570> go

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:11.660 
simple at all goes art never wants to go

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:35.910 
simple at all goes art never wants to go
or<00:04:11.989> in<00:04:12.230> your<00:04:12.410> hand

00:05:55.050 --> 00:05:55.060 
like six times orissa alright so 357 is

00:05:55.060 --> 00:05:56.850 
like six times orissa alright so 357 is
my<00:05:55.150> time<00:05:55.360> so<00:05:55.689> I'm<00:05:55.900> moving<00:05:56.169> that<00:05:56.469> you<00:05:56.560> cannot

00:05:56.850 --> 00:05:56.860 
my time so I'm moving that you cannot

00:05:56.860 --> 00:05:59.070 
my time so I'm moving that you cannot
err<00:05:57.250> you<00:05:57.400> can<00:05:57.639> cut<00:05:58.180> through<00:05:58.389> the<00:05:58.509> arteries<00:05:58.750> and

00:05:59.070 --> 00:05:59.080 
err you can cut through the arteries and

00:05:59.080 --> 00:06:02.010 
err you can cut through the arteries and
pull<00:05:59.289> the<00:05:59.349> heart<00:05:59.530> out<00:06:00.150> fairly<00:06:01.150> simple<00:06:01.629> it<00:06:01.960> is

00:06:02.010 --> 00:06:02.020 
pull the heart out fairly simple it is

00:06:02.020 --> 00:06:04.019 
pull the heart out fairly simple it is
kind<00:06:02.379> of<00:06:02.469> tricky<00:06:02.650> to<00:06:03.009> actually<00:06:03.520> get<00:06:03.699> the<00:06:03.849> heart

00:06:04.019 --> 00:06:04.029 
kind of tricky to actually get the heart

00:06:04.029 --> 00:06:06.749 
kind of tricky to actually get the heart
to<00:06:04.180> stop<00:06:04.360> pumping<00:06:04.830> but<00:06:05.830> what<00:06:05.949> I<00:06:05.979> do<00:06:06.099> is<00:06:06.400> there's

00:06:06.749 --> 00:06:06.759 
to stop pumping but what I do is there's

00:06:06.759 --> 00:06:09.149 
to stop pumping but what I do is there's
four<00:06:07.120> so<00:06:07.900> there's<00:06:08.080> like<00:06:08.229> one<00:06:08.409> two<00:06:08.590> three<00:06:08.860> so

00:06:09.149 --> 00:06:09.159 
four so there's like one two three so

00:06:09.159 --> 00:06:10.619 
four so there's like one two three so
what<00:06:09.279> I<00:06:09.310> do<00:06:09.400> is<00:06:09.520> I<00:06:09.669> kind<00:06:09.849> of<00:06:09.879> like<00:06:10.029> Kate<00:06:10.479> the

00:06:10.619 --> 00:06:10.629 
what I do is I kind of like Kate the

00:06:10.629 --> 00:06:13.589 
what I do is I kind of like Kate the
first<00:06:10.870> two<00:06:11.020> out<00:06:11.370> with<00:06:12.370> a<00:06:12.400> scalpel<00:06:12.639> because<00:06:13.150> so

00:06:13.589 --> 00:06:13.599 
first two out with a scalpel because so

00:06:13.599 --> 00:06:15.140 
first two out with a scalpel because so
when<00:06:13.719> it<00:06:13.810> takes<00:06:13.960> out<00:06:14.199> of<00:06:14.229> that<00:06:14.409> you<00:06:14.650> get<00:06:14.830> the

00:06:15.140 --> 00:06:15.150 
when it takes out of that you get the

00:06:15.150 --> 00:06:18.119 
when it takes out of that you get the
heart<00:06:16.150> can<00:06:16.569> rotate<00:06:17.020> kind<00:06:17.259> of<00:06:17.349> thing<00:06:17.469> so<00:06:17.979> if<00:06:18.039> you

00:06:18.119 --> 00:06:18.129 
heart can rotate kind of thing so if you

00:06:18.129 --> 00:06:19.980 
heart can rotate kind of thing so if you
hit<00:06:18.250> the<00:06:18.340> scalpel<00:06:18.759> it<00:06:18.879> like<00:06:19.029> slip<00:06:19.300> up<00:06:19.449> and<00:06:19.629> then

00:06:19.980 --> 00:06:19.990 
hit the scalpel it like slip up and then

00:06:19.990 --> 00:06:22.529 
hit the scalpel it like slip up and then
you<00:06:20.439> look<00:06:20.620> at<00:06:20.889> gave<00:06:21.310> you<00:06:21.460> access<00:06:21.639> to<00:06:22.000> more<00:06:22.330> like

00:06:22.529 --> 00:06:22.539 
you look at gave you access to more like

00:06:22.539 --> 00:06:24.450 
you look at gave you access to more like
underneath<00:06:23.110> the<00:06:23.349> heart<00:06:23.529> that<00:06:24.039> kind<00:06:24.219> of<00:06:24.250> comes

00:06:24.450 --> 00:06:24.460 
underneath the heart that kind of comes

00:06:24.460 --> 00:06:26.760 
underneath the heart that kind of comes
out<00:06:24.669> it's<00:06:24.849> kind<00:06:25.000> of<00:06:25.029> hard<00:06:25.210> to<00:06:25.270> hit<00:06:25.419> and<00:06:25.900> once

00:06:26.760 --> 00:06:26.770 
out it's kind of hard to hit and once

00:06:26.770 --> 00:06:28.200 
out it's kind of hard to hit and once
you<00:06:26.830> hit<00:06:26.949> those<00:06:27.129> bringing<00:06:27.759> it<00:06:27.879> simply<00:06:28.180> just

00:06:28.200 --> 00:06:28.210 
you hit those bringing it simply just

00:06:28.210 --> 00:06:29.519 
you hit those bringing it simply just
take<00:06:28.419> the<00:06:28.509> heart<00:06:28.629> out<00:06:28.719> and<00:06:28.779> just<00:06:29.050> drop<00:06:29.319> the

00:06:29.519 --> 00:06:29.529 
take the heart out and just drop the

00:06:29.529 --> 00:06:31.950 
take the heart out and just drop the
heart<00:06:29.740> in<00:06:29.889> and<00:06:30.520> then<00:06:30.610> when<00:06:31.389> it's<00:06:31.419> in<00:06:31.659> there<00:06:31.840> you

00:06:31.950 --> 00:06:31.960 
heart in and then when it's in there you

00:06:31.960 --> 00:06:33.809 
heart in and then when it's in there you
grab<00:06:32.199> it<00:06:32.379> and<00:06:32.500> when<00:06:32.680> you<00:06:32.710> grab<00:06:33.009> it<00:06:33.190> it<00:06:33.370> ends<00:06:33.759> a

00:06:33.809 --> 00:06:33.819 
grab it and when you grab it it ends a

00:06:33.819 --> 00:06:36.510 
grab it and when you grab it it ends a
surgery<00:06:34.240> so<00:06:34.770> so<00:06:35.770> yeah<00:06:35.889> so<00:06:36.069> this<00:06:36.190> has<00:06:36.339> been

00:06:36.510 --> 00:06:36.520 
surgery so so yeah so this has been

00:06:36.520 --> 00:06:38.159 
surgery so so yeah so this has been
another<00:06:36.789> video<00:06:37.120> from<00:06:37.240> camera<00:06:37.479> to<00:06:37.659> gamers<00:06:38.050> your

00:06:38.159 --> 00:06:38.169
