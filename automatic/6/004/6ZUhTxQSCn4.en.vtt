have to use IDs so what I do is I

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:01.369 
have to use IDs so what I do is I
instead<00:03:59.970> of<00:04:00.060> using<00:04:00.269> my<00:04:00.420> driver's<00:04:00.810> license<00:04:01.200> in

instead of using my driver's license in

00:04:01.379 --> 00:04:03.140 
instead of using my driver's license in
case<00:04:01.530> it<00:04:01.650> gets<00:04:01.709> lost<00:04:02.040> you<00:04:02.370> know<00:04:02.459> swiping<00:04:02.849> it<00:04:02.970> I

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:03.150 
case it gets lost you know swiping it I

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:08.960 
case it gets lost you know swiping it I
used<00:04:03.720> to<00:04:03.840> just<00:04:03.959> a<00:04:04.019> regular<00:04:04.290> ID<00:04:04.440> card<00:04:07.970> like

00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:08.970 
used to just a regular ID card like

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:11.630 
used to just a regular ID card like
you've<00:04:09.120> seen<00:04:09.329> in<00:04:09.420> my<00:04:09.510> previous<00:04:10.310> videos<00:04:11.310> where

00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:11.640 
you've seen in my previous videos where

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:17.180 
you've seen in my previous videos where
the<00:04:12.540> curtains<00:04:13.790> they<00:04:14.790> do<00:04:14.849> closed<00:04:16.100> the<00:04:17.100> only

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:17.190 
the curtains they do closed the only

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:19.909 
the curtains they do closed the only
downfall<00:04:17.549> is<00:04:17.970> that<00:04:18.380> it<00:04:19.380> would<00:04:19.590> get<00:04:19.799> a<00:04:19.829> little

00:04:19.909 --> 00:04:19.919 
downfall is that it would get a little

00:04:19.919 --> 00:04:21.500 
downfall is that it would get a little
bit<00:04:20.039> warmer<00:04:20.430> in<00:04:20.459> there<00:04:20.639> just<00:04:20.789> because<00:04:21.120> of<00:04:21.359> the

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:21.510 
bit warmer in there just because of the

00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:24.590 
bit warmer in there just because of the
heat<00:04:22.260> and<00:04:22.440> cool<00:04:22.650> duct<00:04:22.860> right<00:04:23.100> there<00:04:23.600> I've

00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:24.600 
heat and cool duct right there I've

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:26.379 
heat and cool duct right there I've
noticed<00:04:24.990> that<00:04:25.110> a<00:04:25.169> couple<00:04:25.500> times<00:04:25.740> on<00:04:25.860> this<00:04:25.979> ship

00:04:26.379 --> 00:04:26.389 
noticed that a couple times on this ship

00:04:26.389 --> 00:04:28.430 
noticed that a couple times on this ship
so<00:04:27.389> when<00:04:27.510> you<00:04:27.630> close<00:04:27.780> those<00:04:27.990> curtains<00:04:28.020> you

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:28.440 
so when you close those curtains you

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:30.200 
so when you close those curtains you
don't<00:04:28.590> get<00:04:28.710> that<00:04:28.860> cooler<00:04:29.160> back<00:04:29.520> there<00:04:29.550> but<00:04:30.000> I

00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:30.210 
don't get that cooler back there but I

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:32.180 
don't get that cooler back there but I
guess<00:04:30.840> if<00:04:30.990> you're<00:04:31.139> cold<00:04:31.380> and<00:04:31.560> you<00:04:31.680> don't<00:04:31.740> you

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:32.190 
guess if you're cold and you don't you

00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:33.710 
guess if you're cold and you don't you
grow<00:04:32.340> them<00:04:32.430> too<00:04:32.580> bad<00:04:32.760> you<00:04:33.150> can<00:04:33.270> always<00:04:33.330> close

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:33.720 
grow them too bad you can always close

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:39.700 
grow them too bad you can always close
those<00:04:34.310> now<00:04:35.310> this<00:04:35.520> particular<00:04:38.120> couch<00:04:39.120> here

square foot it is a little bit nicer
then<00:06:29.850> you<00:06:30.390> know<00:06:30.480> my<00:06:30.630> previous<00:06:31.020> video<00:06:31.290> is<00:06:31.380> on

00:06:31.490 --> 00:06:31.500 
then you know my previous video is on

00:06:31.500 --> 00:06:33.140 
then you know my previous video is on
like<00:06:31.680> the<00:06:31.800> monarch<00:06:32.010> which<00:06:32.400> was<00:06:32.580> very<00:06:32.820> small

00:06:33.140 --> 00:06:33.150 
like the monarch which was very small

00:06:33.150 --> 00:06:37.460 
like the monarch which was very small
but<00:06:34.160> in<00:06:35.160> a<00:06:35.280> good<00:06:35.430> thing<00:06:35.610> about<00:06:35.700> 45<00:06:36.210> 27<00:06:36.990> if<00:06:37.260> you

00:06:37.460 --> 00:06:37.470 
but in a good thing about 45 27 if you

00:06:37.470 --> 00:06:39.620 
but in a good thing about 45 27 if you
look<00:06:37.650> on<00:06:37.800> the<00:06:37.890> map<00:06:38.070> this<00:06:38.760> is<00:06:38.820> very<00:06:39.210> very<00:06:39.360> good

00:06:39.620 --> 00:06:39.630 
look on the map this is very very good

00:06:39.630 --> 00:06:41.960 
look on the map this is very very good
because<00:06:39.780> right<00:06:40.170> above<00:06:41.040> us<00:06:41.220> is<00:06:41.430> Deck<00:06:41.640> five

00:06:41.960 --> 00:06:41.970 
because right above us is Deck five

00:06:41.970 --> 00:06:45.400 
because right above us is Deck five
where<00:06:42.420> you<00:06:42.510> can<00:06:42.600> go<00:06:42.720> to<00:06:42.780> the<00:06:42.960> port<00:06:43.200> side<00:06:43.410> and
