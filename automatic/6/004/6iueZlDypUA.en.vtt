at<00:01:06.030> my<00:01:06.119> life<00:01:06.330> and<00:01:06.510> decided<00:01:07.200> that<00:01:07.229> art<00:01:08.010> was

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
at my life and decided that art was

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:10.070 
at my life and decided that art was
gonna<00:01:08.310> be<00:01:08.490> the<00:01:08.549> most<00:01:08.610> difficult<00:01:09.080> eternally

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080 
gonna be the most difficult eternally

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:12.140 
gonna be the most difficult eternally
challenging<00:01:10.619> thing<00:01:10.860> that<00:01:11.310> I<00:01:11.460> could<00:01:11.729> find<00:01:12.000> to

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
challenging thing that I could find to

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:14.240 
challenging thing that I could find to
do<00:01:12.299> and<00:01:12.630> so<00:01:13.110> I<00:01:13.140> went<00:01:13.350> ahead<00:01:13.409> and<00:01:13.680> just<00:01:13.860> went<00:01:14.189> for

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
do and so I went ahead and just went for

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:16.249 
do and so I went ahead and just went for
that<00:01:14.490> and<00:01:14.729> then<00:01:15.180> it<00:01:15.390> took<00:01:15.509> me<00:01:15.659> about<00:01:15.840> five

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259 
that and then it took me about five

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:18.710 
that and then it took me about five
years<00:01:16.590> of<00:01:16.860> schooling<00:01:17.189> and<00:01:17.520> practice<00:01:17.939> to<00:01:18.540> get

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720 
years of schooling and practice to get

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:20.240 
years of schooling and practice to get
to<00:01:18.869> that<00:01:18.960> professional<00:01:19.560> level<00:01:19.860> to<00:01:20.040> get<00:01:20.130> to

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
to that professional level to get to

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:21.499 
to that professional level to get to
that<00:01:20.369> level<00:01:20.549> where<00:01:20.700> I<00:01:20.820> could<00:01:21.000> actually<00:01:21.119> make<00:01:21.450> a

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509 
that level where I could actually make a

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:23.359 
that level where I could actually make a
living<00:01:21.720> at<00:01:21.900> this<00:01:21.930> stuff<00:01:22.259> and<00:01:22.409> at<00:01:22.890> that<00:01:23.009> point<00:01:23.159> I

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:23.369 
living at this stuff and at that point I

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:25.219 
living at this stuff and at that point I
figured<00:01:23.909> you<00:01:24.240> know<00:01:24.299> maybe<00:01:24.390> I<00:01:24.750> did<00:01:24.960> make<00:01:25.110> the

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
figured you know maybe I did make the

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:28.039 
figured you know maybe I did make the
right<00:01:25.259> decision<00:01:25.799> choosing<00:01:26.520> art<00:01:26.850> I<00:01:27.210> tend<00:01:27.990> to

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:28.049 
right decision choosing art I tend to

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:30.140 
right decision choosing art I tend to
work<00:01:28.200> digitally<00:01:28.590> almost<00:01:29.520> all<00:01:29.670> my<00:01:29.820> work<00:01:30.000> is

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.150 
work digitally almost all my work is

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:31.520 
work digitally almost all my work is
digital<00:01:30.509> these<00:01:30.630> days<00:01:30.689> but<00:01:31.140> that's<00:01:31.320> mainly

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
digital these days but that's mainly

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:33.140 
digital these days but that's mainly
because<00:01:31.799> of<00:01:31.920> time<00:01:32.189> constraints<00:01:32.700> some<00:01:33.000> of<00:01:33.060> my

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:33.150 
because of time constraints some of my
