this says that's going to help which is
windchill<00:02:50.090> dramatically<00:02:51.120> well<00:02:51.570> you'll<00:02:51.690> also

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:51.840 
windchill dramatically well you'll also

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:53.300 
windchill dramatically well you'll also
notice<00:02:52.200> is<00:02:52.470> what<00:02:52.620> you<00:02:52.739> can<00:02:52.950> do<00:02:53.100> is<00:02:53.160> they've

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:53.310 
notice is what you can do is they've

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:54.500 
notice is what you can do is they've
they've<00:02:53.489> pretty<00:02:53.670> much<00:02:53.760> sealed<00:02:54.120> the<00:02:54.239> bottom

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:54.510 
they've pretty much sealed the bottom

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:56.750 
they've pretty much sealed the bottom
part<00:02:54.750> off<00:02:54.870> of<00:02:55.140> the<00:02:55.620> actual<00:02:55.709> outside<00:02:56.040> pocket<00:02:56.640> so

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:56.760 
part off of the actual outside pocket so

00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:58.280 
part off of the actual outside pocket so
you<00:02:56.880> can<00:02:57.000> actually<00:02:57.120> use<00:02:57.480> this<00:02:57.630> as<00:02:57.690> well<00:02:58.110> as

00:02:58.280 --> 00:02:58.290 
you can actually use this as well as

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:00.380 
you can actually use this as well as
additional<00:02:58.769> storage<00:02:58.830> so<00:02:59.550> it's<00:03:00.180> wide<00:03:00.360> enough

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:00.390 
additional storage so it's wide enough

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:03.080 
additional storage so it's wide enough
for<00:03:00.750> your<00:03:00.840> OS<00:03:01.019> maps<00:03:01.500> and<00:03:01.830> your<00:03:02.220> GPS<00:03:02.670> systems

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:03.090 
for your OS maps and your GPS systems

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:04.100 
for your OS maps and your GPS systems
bits<00:03:03.330> that<00:03:03.450> you<00:03:03.510> kind<00:03:03.750> of<00:03:03.780> want<00:03:03.959> to<00:03:03.989> keep

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:04.110 
bits that you kind of want to keep

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:06.199 
bits that you kind of want to keep
polish<00:03:04.440> to<00:03:04.590> your<00:03:04.650> chest<00:03:04.980> and<00:03:05.310> now<00:03:05.910> obviously

00:03:06.199 --> 00:03:06.209 
polish to your chest and now obviously

00:03:06.209 --> 00:03:07.940 
polish to your chest and now obviously
depending<00:03:06.900> on<00:03:06.989> the<00:03:07.080> space<00:03:07.320> and<00:03:07.500> that<00:03:07.560> depends

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:07.950 
depending on the space and that depends

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:09.530 
depending on the space and that depends
on<00:03:08.040> how<00:03:08.190> oft<00:03:08.340> how<00:03:08.760> will<00:03:08.910> you<00:03:09.000> actually<00:03:09.180> fill

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:09.540 
on how oft how will you actually fill

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:12.440 
on how oft how will you actually fill
those<00:03:09.690> main<00:03:10.019> pockets<00:03:10.470> as<00:03:10.650> well<00:03:11.180> so<00:03:12.180> let<00:03:12.360> me

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:12.450 
those main pockets as well so let me

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:15.110 
those main pockets as well so let me
just<00:03:12.630> zip<00:03:12.870> this<00:03:13.019> up<00:03:13.230> and<00:03:13.560> then<00:03:14.489> we'll<00:03:14.640> spin<00:03:14.970> it

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:15.120 
just zip this up and then we'll spin it

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:17.509 
just zip this up and then we'll spin it
around<00:03:15.290> so<00:03:16.290> the<00:03:16.440> back<00:03:16.620> you<00:03:16.920> can<00:03:17.070> see<00:03:17.220> it<00:03:17.250> never

00:03:17.509 --> 00:03:17.519 
around so the back you can see it never

00:03:17.519 --> 00:03:19.520 
around so the back you can see it never
reflective<00:03:18.180> panels<00:03:18.600> on<00:03:18.780> there<00:03:19.079> and<00:03:19.230> it<00:03:19.350> does

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:19.530 
reflective panels on there and it does

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:21.350 
reflective panels on there and it does
have<00:03:19.799> an<00:03:19.950> alpine<00:03:20.489> fit<00:03:20.790> of<00:03:20.940> it<00:03:21.030> so<00:03:21.209> it's

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:21.360 
have an alpine fit of it so it's

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:23.420 
have an alpine fit of it so it's
slightly<00:03:21.630> lowering<00:03:22.140> the<00:03:22.320> bum<00:03:22.500> section<00:03:22.920> and<00:03:23.130> it

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:23.430 
slightly lowering the bum section and it

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:24.740 
slightly lowering the bum section and it
does<00:03:23.579> have<00:03:23.730> a<00:03:23.820> slight<00:03:24.030> fit<00:03:24.269> to<00:03:24.390> it<00:03:24.480> this<00:03:24.570> means

00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:24.750 
does have a slight fit to it this means

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:26.360 
does have a slight fit to it this means
the<00:03:24.959> softshell<00:03:25.260> jackets<00:03:25.709> actually<00:03:26.130> going<00:03:26.280> to
