00:02:01.009 --> 00:02:03.490 
mean it's a more accurate as
improvements<00:02:01.460> to<00:02:01.820> the<00:02:01.939> focus<00:02:02.390> system<00:02:02.689> which

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:03.500 
improvements to the focus system which

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:05.649 
improvements to the focus system which
how<00:02:04.369> much<00:02:04.520> detail<00:02:04.729> you<00:02:04.909> want<00:02:05.090> to<00:02:05.150> go<00:02:05.210> into<00:02:05.360> but

00:02:05.649 --> 00:02:05.659 
how much detail you want to go into but

00:02:05.659 --> 00:02:07.870 
how much detail you want to go into but
it's<00:02:05.810> a<00:02:05.990> the<00:02:06.470> medium<00:02:06.860> deep<00:02:07.009> focus<00:02:07.189> promise<00:02:07.759> to

00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:07.880 
it's a the medium deep focus promise to

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:09.790 
it's a the medium deep focus promise to
being<00:02:08.060> free<00:02:08.300> okay<00:02:08.840> which<00:02:09.140> means<00:02:09.440> that<00:02:09.649> when

00:02:09.790 --> 00:02:09.800 
being free okay which means that when

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:11.260 
being free okay which means that when
things<00:02:10.069> are<00:02:10.250> sort<00:02:10.399> of<00:02:10.429> half<00:02:10.700> out<00:02:10.940> of<00:02:10.970> focus

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:11.270 
things are sort of half out of focus

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:13.330 
things are sort of half out of focus
able<00:02:12.110> to<00:02:12.290> them<00:02:12.410> back<00:02:12.560> into<00:02:12.709> focus<00:02:12.890> much<00:02:13.310> more

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:13.340 
able to them back into focus much more

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:16.360 
able to them back into focus much more
quickly<00:02:13.640> than<00:02:14.260> previous<00:02:15.260> models<00:02:15.290> okay<00:02:15.920> so

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:16.370 
quickly than previous models okay so

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:18.010 
quickly than previous models okay so
that's<00:02:16.520> a<00:02:16.640> really<00:02:16.819> good<00:02:17.180> of<00:02:17.270> improvement<00:02:17.810> and

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:18.020 
that's a really good of improvement and

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:20.949 
that's a really good of improvement and
as<00:02:18.950> I<00:02:19.220> said<00:02:19.280> we<00:02:20.090> have<00:02:20.209> the<00:02:20.330> contrast<00:02:20.690> a<00:02:20.810> tech

00:02:20.949 --> 00:02:20.959 
as I said we have the contrast a tech

00:02:20.959 --> 00:02:22.990 
as I said we have the contrast a tech
live<00:02:21.170> view<00:02:21.440> for<00:02:22.069> a<00:02:22.130> kind<00:02:22.310> of<00:02:22.459> live<00:02:22.610> view<00:02:22.760> modes

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:23.000 
live view for a kind of live view modes

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:27.880 
live view for a kind of live view modes
which<00:02:23.319> wasn't<00:02:24.319> in<00:02:24.500> the<00:02:24.560> 400<00:02:24.980> e<00:02:25.569> and<00:02:26.569> also<00:02:26.989> a<00:02:27.530> new

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:27.890 
which wasn't in the 400 e and also a new

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:30.340 
which wasn't in the 400 e and also a new
mouse<00:02:28.069> or<00:02:28.430> a<00:02:28.459> highlight<00:02:29.120> tone<00:02:29.360> priority<00:02:29.900> right

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:30.350 
mouse or a highlight tone priority right

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:33.250 
mouse or a highlight tone priority right
and<00:02:30.830> that<00:02:30.920> essentially<00:02:31.310> moves<00:02:31.700> the<00:02:32.260> exposure

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:33.260 
and that essentially moves the exposure

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:35.800 
and that essentially moves the exposure
up<00:02:33.470> myself<00:02:33.680> are<00:02:34.010> stopped<00:02:34.310> so<00:02:34.519> you<00:02:34.580> get<00:02:34.880> much

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:35.810 
up myself are stopped so you get much

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:37.479 
up myself are stopped so you get much
more<00:02:35.959> detail<00:02:36.290> in<00:02:36.380> the<00:02:36.440> highlights<00:02:36.769> okay

00:02:37.479 --> 00:02:37.489 
more detail in the highlights okay

00:02:37.489 --> 00:02:39.309 
more detail in the highlights okay
because<00:02:37.910> I<00:02:38.060> very<00:02:38.420> easy<00:02:38.600> to<00:02:38.720> blow<00:02:38.840> out<00:02:38.989> detail

00:02:39.309 --> 00:02:39.319 
because I very easy to blow out detail

00:02:39.319 --> 00:02:40.720 
because I very easy to blow out detail
in<00:02:39.410> highlights<00:02:39.799> but<00:02:40.280> you<00:02:40.370> said<00:02:40.519> that<00:02:40.580> before

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:40.730 
in highlights but you said that before

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:42.190 
in highlights but you said that before
we<00:02:40.940> take<00:02:41.090> the<00:02:41.180> pictur<00:02:41.390> does<00:02:41.660> it<00:02:41.750> do<00:02:41.840> that<00:02:41.870> to

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:42.200 
we take the pictur does it do that to

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:43.630 
we take the pictur does it do that to
picture<00:02:42.530> afterwards<00:02:42.950> and<00:02:43.130> save<00:02:43.340> a<00:02:43.370> coffee

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:43.640 
picture afterwards and save a coffee

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:45.550 
picture afterwards and save a coffee
before<00:02:44.450> you<00:02:44.510> take<00:02:44.690> the<00:02:44.780> broader<00:02:44.959> picture<00:02:45.290> okay

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:45.560 
before you take the broader picture okay

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:47.740 
before you take the broader picture okay
and<00:02:45.980> custom<00:02:46.250> function<00:02:46.610> well<00:02:47.000> okay<00:02:47.299> so<00:02:47.660> it

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:47.750 
and custom function well okay so it

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:49.809 
and custom function well okay so it
means<00:02:47.870> that<00:02:47.989> the<00:02:48.530> expense<00:02:48.920> of<00:02:49.130> a<00:02:49.430> detail<00:02:49.730> in

00:02:49.809 --> 00:02:49.819 
means that the expense of a detail in

00:02:49.819 --> 00:02:52.270 
means that the expense of a detail in
the<00:02:49.880> shadows<00:02:49.910> which<00:02:50.540> to<00:02:50.750> be<00:02:50.840> honest<00:02:51.110> isn't<00:02:51.950> it

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:52.280 
the shadows which to be honest isn't it

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:54.070 
the shadows which to be honest isn't it
is<00:02:52.519> always<00:02:52.670> there<00:02:52.940> in<00:02:53.120> a<00:02:53.180> way<00:02:53.299> in<00:02:53.450> England<00:02:53.810> side

if you're under exposed and bringin up a

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:19.720 
if you're under exposed and bringin up a
bit<00:03:16.010> in<00:03:16.040> a<00:03:16.400> frozen<00:03:16.640> food<00:03:17.980> also<00:03:18.980> uses<00:03:19.430> a<00:03:19.459> face

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:19.730 
bit in a frozen food also uses a face

can<00:05:36.650> see<00:05:36.800> that<00:05:36.950> we<00:05:37.070> have<00:05:37.100> a<00:05:37.220> medir<00:05:37.760> seen<00:05:37.940> star

00:05:38.200 --> 00:05:38.210 
can see that we have a medir seen star

00:05:38.210 --> 00:05:41.140 
can see that we have a medir seen star
yeah

00:05:41.140 --> 00:05:41.150 

00:05:41.150 --> 00:05:43.270 

and<00:05:41.690> press<00:05:41.990> the<00:05:42.140> exposure<00:05:42.680> lock<00:05:42.830> button<00:05:43.100> as

and press the exposure lock button as
normal<00:05:43.580> and<00:05:44.030> it<00:05:44.330> gains<00:05:44.540> focus<00:05:44.960> like<00:05:45.140> dses<00:05:45.590> do

00:05:45.760 --> 00:05:45.770 
normal and it gains focus like dses do

00:05:45.770 --> 00:05:47.890 
normal and it gains focus like dses do
it<00:05:45.890> goes<00:05:46.040> green<00:05:46.310> coconut<00:05:47.150> got<00:05:47.300> the<00:05:47.360> focus<00:05:47.720> and

00:05:47.890 --> 00:05:47.900 
it goes green coconut got the focus and

then you press the shutter button okay
it's<00:05:50.510> really<00:05:50.720> useful<00:05:50.930> for<00:05:51.200> the<00:05:51.260> kind<00:05:51.440> of

00:05:51.490 --> 00:05:51.500 
it's really useful for the kind of

00:05:51.500 --> 00:05:53.320 
it's really useful for the kind of
people<00:05:51.710> living<00:05:51.890> in<00:05:51.980> buying<00:05:52.160> this<00:05:52.280> camera<00:05:52.640> they

00:05:53.320 --> 00:05:53.330 
people living in buying this camera they

00:05:53.330 --> 00:05:54.820 
people living in buying this camera they
may<00:05:53.720> have<00:05:53.840> come<00:05:54.020> up<00:05:54.140> from<00:05:54.320> dear<00:05:54.500> see<00:05:54.680> in<00:05:54.740> the

may have come up from dear see in the

00:05:54.830 --> 00:05:56.320 
may have come up from dear see in the
first<00:05:55.040> place<00:05:55.190> they're<00:05:55.790> much<00:05:55.940> more<00:05:56.090> familiar

00:05:56.320 --> 00:05:56.330 
first place they're much more familiar

00:05:56.330 --> 00:05:57.730 
first place they're much more familiar
with<00:05:56.540> the<00:05:56.690> idea<00:05:56.960> of<00:05:57.020> looking<00:05:57.200> at<00:05:57.470> the<00:05:57.530> photo

00:05:57.730 --> 00:05:57.740 
with the idea of looking at the photo

00:05:57.740 --> 00:05:59.410 
with the idea of looking at the photo
and<00:05:58.220> looking<00:05:58.490> at<00:05:58.580> the<00:05:58.670> preview<00:05:59.030> on<00:05:59.300> the

00:05:59.410 --> 00:05:59.420 
and looking at the preview on the

00:05:59.420 --> 00:06:01.450 
and looking at the preview on the
Supreme<00:05:59.720> so<00:06:00.320> this<00:06:00.470> is<00:06:00.590> making<00:06:01.130> the<00:06:01.190> camera<00:06:01.430> a

00:06:01.450 --> 00:06:01.460 
Supreme so this is making the camera a

00:06:01.460 --> 00:06:04.960 
Supreme so this is making the camera a
lot<00:06:01.580> more<00:06:01.700> useful<00:06:01.820> for<00:06:02.180> them<00:06:03.730> so<00:06:04.730> I<00:06:04.760> gather

00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:04.970 
lot more useful for them so I gather

00:06:04.970 --> 00:06:07.390 
lot more useful for them so I gather
also<00:06:05.300> this<00:06:05.710> camera<00:06:06.710> comes<00:06:06.920> with<00:06:06.980> the<00:06:07.100> new<00:06:07.190> kit

00:06:07.390 --> 00:06:07.400 
also this camera comes with the new kit

00:06:07.400 --> 00:06:11.260 
also this camera comes with the new kit
lens<00:06:07.580> as<00:06:07.760> well<00:06:07.940> yes<00:06:08.720> the<00:06:09.410> 18<00:06:09.650> to<00:06:09.800> 55<00:06:10.100> kit<00:06:11.090> lens

lens as well yes the 18 to 55 kit lens

00:06:11.270 --> 00:06:13.060 
lens as well yes the 18 to 55 kit lens
quite<00:06:12.260> similar<00:06:12.530> to<00:06:12.560> the<00:06:12.650> one<00:06:12.770> that<00:06:12.890> came<00:06:12.950> with

00:06:13.060 --> 00:06:13.070 
quite similar to the one that came with

00:06:13.070 --> 00:06:14.650 
quite similar to the one that came with
the<00:06:13.130> 400d<00:06:13.670> but<00:06:13.910> the<00:06:14.000> critical<00:06:14.330> thing<00:06:14.510> about

00:06:14.650 --> 00:06:14.660 
the 400d but the critical thing about

00:06:14.660 --> 00:06:16.480 
the 400d but the critical thing about
this<00:06:14.810> it's<00:06:15.410> now<00:06:15.530> about<00:06:15.590> English<00:06:15.920> stabilizing

00:06:16.480 --> 00:06:16.490 
this it's now about English stabilizing

00:06:16.490 --> 00:06:17.920 
this it's now about English stabilizing
standard<00:06:17.120> to<00:06:17.210> the<00:06:17.330> kit<00:06:17.510> lens<00:06:17.540> with<00:06:17.840> this

00:06:17.920 --> 00:06:17.930 
standard to the kit lens with this

00:06:17.930 --> 00:06:21.160 
standard to the kit lens with this
camera<00:06:18.170> as<00:06:18.470> are<00:06:19.120> all<00:06:20.120> image<00:06:20.750> stabilizer

00:06:21.160 --> 00:06:21.170 
camera as are all image stabilizer

00:06:21.170 --> 00:06:23.380 
camera as are all image stabilizer
systems<00:06:21.740> right<00:06:22.040> I<00:06:22.370> guess<00:06:23.090> that's<00:06:23.240> something

00:06:23.380 --> 00:06:23.390 
systems right I guess that's something

00:06:23.390 --> 00:06:25.780 
systems right I guess that's something
you've<00:06:23.660> done<00:06:23.780> to<00:06:23.930> counter<00:06:24.350> the<00:06:24.790> competition

00:06:25.780 --> 00:06:25.790 
you've done to counter the competition

00:06:25.790 --> 00:06:27.400 
you've done to counter the competition
would<00:06:25.910> have<00:06:26.090> built<00:06:26.300> in<00:06:26.450> stabilization<00:06:26.930> on<00:06:27.320> the

00:06:27.400 --> 00:06:27.410 
would have built in stabilization on the

00:06:27.410 --> 00:06:30.790 
would have built in stabilization on the
sensor<00:06:27.800> either<00:06:29.410> manufactures<00:06:30.410> out<00:06:30.530> they<00:06:30.650> know

00:06:30.790 --> 00:06:30.800 
sensor either manufactures out they know

00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:32.470 
sensor either manufactures out they know
they're<00:06:31.010> putting<00:06:31.310> body<00:06:31.880> image<00:06:32.450> and

00:06:32.470 --> 00:06:32.480 
they're putting body image and

00:06:32.480 --> 00:06:34.630 
they're putting body image and
organization<00:06:33.170> but<00:06:33.590> we<00:06:33.800> at<00:06:33.890> canon<00:06:34.130> we<00:06:34.250> do

00:06:34.630 --> 00:06:34.640 
organization but we at canon we do

00:06:34.640 --> 00:06:36.070 
organization but we at canon we do
really<00:06:34.850> firmly<00:06:35.180> believe<00:06:35.480> that<00:06:35.510> lens

00:06:36.070 --> 00:06:36.080 
really firmly believe that lens

00:06:36.080 --> 00:06:38.860 
really firmly believe that lens
stabilization<00:06:37.040> is<00:06:37.310> the<00:06:37.580> best<00:06:37.790> method<00:06:38.030> and

00:06:38.860 --> 00:06:38.870 
stabilization is the best method and

00:06:38.870 --> 00:06:41.380 
stabilization is the best method and
firstly<00:06:39.320> for<00:06:39.770> start<00:06:40.070> you<00:06:40.430> get<00:06:40.640> the<00:06:40.820> image

00:06:41.380 --> 00:06:41.390 
firstly for start you get the image

00:06:41.390 --> 00:06:42.970 
firstly for start you get the image
stabilized<00:06:41.810> effect<00:06:42.140> in<00:06:42.260> the<00:06:42.320> viewfinder<00:06:42.500> and

00:06:42.970 --> 00:06:42.980 
stabilized effect in the viewfinder and

00:06:42.980 --> 00:06:44.710 
stabilized effect in the viewfinder and
so<00:06:43.700> that's<00:06:43.910> especially<00:06:44.360> if<00:06:44.510> you're<00:06:44.600> shooting

00:06:44.710 --> 00:06:44.720 
so that's especially if you're shooting

00:06:44.720 --> 00:06:46.330 
so that's especially if you're shooting
the<00:06:44.930> long<00:06:45.110> lens<00:06:45.290> you<00:06:45.620> really<00:06:45.890> do<00:06:46.040> want<00:06:46.220> to<00:06:46.280> be

00:06:46.330 --> 00:06:46.340 
the long lens you really do want to be

00:06:46.340 --> 00:06:48.430 
the long lens you really do want to be
able<00:06:46.400> to<00:06:46.550> see<00:06:46.760> the<00:06:47.090> image<00:06:47.630> stabilized<00:06:48.230> before

00:06:48.430 --> 00:06:48.440 
able to see the image stabilized before

00:06:48.440 --> 00:06:51.300 
able to see the image stabilized before
you<00:06:48.680> shoot<00:06:48.890> right<00:06:49.460> and<00:06:50.060> of<00:06:50.150> course

00:06:51.300 --> 00:06:51.310 
you shoot right and of course

00:06:51.310 --> 00:06:53.700 
you shoot right and of course
along<00:06:51.940> with<00:06:51.970> that<00:06:52.150> is<00:06:52.960> if<00:06:53.260> you<00:06:53.410> are<00:06:53.560> shooting

00:06:53.700 --> 00:06:53.710 
along with that is if you are shooting

00:06:53.710 --> 00:06:55.590 
along with that is if you are shooting
over<00:06:54.010> the<00:06:54.100> long<00:06:54.220> lens<00:06:54.430> you<00:06:54.970> want<00:06:55.150> the<00:06:55.300> AF

00:06:55.590 --> 00:06:55.600 
over the long lens you want the AF

00:06:55.600 --> 00:06:58.470 
over the long lens you want the AF
system<00:06:55.780> to<00:06:56.110> be<00:06:56.230> able<00:06:56.260> to<00:06:56.440> see<00:06:57.270> staple<00:06:58.270> image

00:06:58.470 --> 00:06:58.480 
system to be able to see staple image

other thing is of course especially as a
cannon<00:07:16.660> we've<00:07:16.780> got<00:07:16.930> such<00:07:17.110> a<00:07:17.140> big<00:07:17.380> heritage<00:07:17.860> in

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:18.010 
cannon we've got such a big heritage in

00:07:18.010 --> 00:07:19.890 
cannon we've got such a big heritage in
lenses<00:07:18.430> and<00:07:18.820> in<00:07:19.180> the<00:07:19.270> image<00:07:19.450> stabilized

00:07:19.890 --> 00:07:19.900 
lenses and in the image stabilized

00:07:19.900 --> 00:07:21.930 
lenses and in the image stabilized
system<00:07:20.290> is<00:07:20.770> that<00:07:20.950> for<00:07:21.190> each<00:07:21.250> lens<00:07:21.610> you<00:07:21.910> can

00:07:21.930 --> 00:07:21.940 
system is that for each lens you can

00:07:21.940 --> 00:07:23.760 
system is that for each lens you can
optimize<00:07:22.570> them<00:07:22.840> the<00:07:23.020> image<00:07:23.230> stabilizer<00:07:23.650> for

00:07:23.760 --> 00:07:23.770 
optimize them the image stabilizer for

00:07:23.770 --> 00:07:25.920 
optimize them the image stabilizer for
that<00:07:24.070> particular<00:07:24.190> lens<00:07:24.640> right<00:07:25.150> if<00:07:25.570> you<00:07:25.690> put<00:07:25.870> it

00:07:25.920 --> 00:07:25.930 
that particular lens right if you put it

00:07:25.930 --> 00:07:26.910 
that particular lens right if you put it
in<00:07:25.990> the<00:07:26.050> body<00:07:26.230> as<00:07:26.470> a<00:07:26.590> fan<00:07:26.710> of<00:07:26.740> a

00:07:26.910 --> 00:07:26.920 
in the body as a fan of a

00:07:26.920 --> 00:07:29.610 
in the body as a fan of a
one-size-fits-all<00:07:27.960> methodology<00:07:28.960> with<00:07:29.140> you

00:07:29.610 --> 00:07:29.620 
one-size-fits-all methodology with you

00:07:29.620 --> 00:07:32.960 
one-size-fits-all methodology with you
can't<00:07:29.860> get<00:07:30.070> the<00:07:30.220> most<00:07:30.610> out<00:07:30.850> of<00:07:30.880> the<00:07:31.150> system

00:07:32.960 --> 00:07:32.970 
can't get the most out of the system

00:07:32.970 --> 00:07:40.170 
can't get the most out of the system
okay<00:07:33.990> yeah<00:07:34.990> okay<00:07:38.340> the<00:07:39.340> body<00:07:39.520> is<00:07:39.610> very<00:07:39.970> similar

00:07:40.170 --> 00:07:40.180 
okay yeah okay the body is very similar

00:07:40.180 --> 00:07:42.170 
okay yeah okay the body is very similar
to<00:07:40.300> the<00:07:40.420> 400<00:07:40.900> days<00:07:41.020> and<00:07:41.230> it's<00:07:41.440> almost<00:07:41.800> the<00:07:41.920> same

00:07:42.170 --> 00:07:42.180 
to the 400 days and it's almost the same

00:07:42.180 --> 00:07:45.540 
to the 400 days and it's almost the same
external<00:07:43.180> body<00:07:43.480> a<00:07:43.660> few<00:07:43.870> refinements<00:07:44.170> and<00:07:44.620> we

00:07:45.540 --> 00:07:45.550 
external body a few refinements and we

00:07:45.550 --> 00:07:47.730 
external body a few refinements and we
now<00:07:45.670> use<00:07:45.850> SD<00:07:46.090> card<00:07:46.450> only<00:07:46.600> in<00:07:46.840> here<00:07:47.110> right<00:07:47.440> and

00:07:47.730 --> 00:07:47.740 
now use SD card only in here right and

00:07:47.740 --> 00:07:49.320 
now use SD card only in here right and
we<00:07:47.920> felt<00:07:48.130> that<00:07:48.190> the<00:07:48.370> people<00:07:48.790> who<00:07:49.000> buying<00:07:49.240> this

00:07:49.320 --> 00:07:49.330 
we felt that the people who buying this

00:07:49.330 --> 00:07:51.240 
we felt that the people who buying this
camera<00:07:49.690> would<00:07:49.870> be<00:07:49.990> familiar<00:07:50.350> with<00:07:50.380> SD<00:07:50.830> and

00:07:51.240 --> 00:07:51.250 
camera would be familiar with SD and

00:07:51.250 --> 00:07:53.100 
camera would be familiar with SD and
smaller<00:07:51.670> actually<00:07:52.360> enables<00:07:52.630> the<00:07:52.690> camera<00:07:52.930> tree

00:07:53.100 --> 00:07:53.110 
smaller actually enables the camera tree

00:07:53.110 --> 00:07:55.530 
smaller actually enables the camera tree
about<00:07:53.440> three<00:07:53.770> millimeters<00:07:54.100> thinner<00:07:54.700> okay

00:07:55.530 --> 00:07:55.540 
about three millimeters thinner okay

00:07:55.540 --> 00:07:57.930 
about three millimeters thinner okay
it's<00:07:56.410> a<00:07:56.470> slightly<00:07:56.710> bigger<00:07:57.010> camera<00:07:57.400> in<00:07:57.640> general

00:07:57.930 --> 00:07:57.940 
it's a slightly bigger camera in general

00:07:57.940 --> 00:07:59.250 
it's a slightly bigger camera in general
but<00:07:58.030> that's<00:07:58.210> mainly<00:07:58.390> to<00:07:58.690> make<00:07:58.840> it<00:07:58.990> a<00:07:59.020> bit

00:07:59.250 --> 00:07:59.260 
but that's mainly to make it a bit

00:07:59.260 --> 00:08:01.620 
but that's mainly to make it a bit
easier<00:07:59.500> to<00:07:59.710> handle<00:07:59.920> and<00:08:00.310> find<00:08:00.790> that<00:08:00.940> the<00:08:01.090> grip

00:08:01.620 --> 00:08:01.630 
easier to handle and find that the grip

00:08:01.630 --> 00:08:04.230 
easier to handle and find that the grip
is<00:08:01.870> a<00:08:02.530> real<00:08:02.740> pleasure<00:08:02.920> to<00:08:03.160> follow<00:08:03.340> down<00:08:03.580> it's

00:08:04.230 --> 00:08:04.240 
is a real pleasure to follow down it's

00:08:04.240 --> 00:08:06.930 
is a real pleasure to follow down it's
been<00:08:04.390> extended<00:08:04.840> isn't<00:08:05.110> it<00:08:05.320> feels<00:08:05.620> a<00:08:05.940> chunkier

00:08:06.930 --> 00:08:06.940 
been extended isn't it feels a chunkier

00:08:06.940 --> 00:08:09.850 
been extended isn't it feels a chunkier
bigger<00:08:07.120> bigger<00:08:07.750> purchasing<00:08:08.110> focus<00:08:08.650> on<00:08:08.800> it
