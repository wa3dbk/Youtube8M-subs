00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:54.670 
gonna shoot so i quickly changed her fur
claw<00:02:52.940> her<00:02:53.510> far<00:02:53.750> fan<00:02:53.959> who<00:02:54.140> I<00:02:54.170> wanted<00:02:54.440> to<00:02:54.530> shoot

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:54.680 
claw her far fan who I wanted to shoot

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:56.050 
claw her far fan who I wanted to shoot
it<00:02:54.830> and<00:02:55.010> he<00:02:55.250> wasn't<00:02:55.370> able<00:02:55.489> to<00:02:55.580> get<00:02:55.670> back<00:02:55.880> there

00:02:56.050 --> 00:02:56.060 
it and he wasn't able to get back there

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:57.430 
it and he wasn't able to get back there
in<00:02:56.180> time<00:02:56.330> quite<00:02:56.720> at<00:02:56.810> home<00:02:56.930> right<00:02:57.200> top<00:02:57.410> corner

00:02:57.430 --> 00:02:57.440 
in time quite at home right top corner

00:02:57.440 --> 00:02:59.650 
in time quite at home right top corner
and<00:02:57.980> I<00:02:58.760> think<00:02:58.970> that's<00:02:59.120> the<00:02:59.209> first<00:02:59.450> time<00:02:59.540> I

00:02:59.650 --> 00:02:59.660 
and I think that's the first time I

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:01.630 
and I think that's the first time I
squirt<00:02:59.900> a<00:02:59.930> free-kick<00:03:00.170> in<00:03:00.470> this<00:03:00.620> series<00:03:00.830> I'm

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:01.640 
squirt a free-kick in this series I'm

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:03.130 
squirt a free-kick in this series I'm
not<00:03:01.790> exactly<00:03:02.000> sure<00:03:02.180> but<00:03:02.330> it's<00:03:02.810> pretty<00:03:02.930> awesome

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:03.140 
not exactly sure but it's pretty awesome

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:05.710 
not exactly sure but it's pretty awesome
and<00:03:03.560> I<00:03:03.620> like<00:03:03.739> I<00:03:03.890> think<00:03:04.280> guys<00:03:04.489> if<00:03:05.150> you're<00:03:05.330> doing

00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:05.720 
and I like I think guys if you're doing

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:07.090 
and I like I think guys if you're doing
a<00:03:05.780> free-kick<00:03:05.959> and<00:03:06.290> you<00:03:06.350> notice<00:03:06.590> him<00:03:06.739> run<00:03:06.980> his

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:07.100 
a free-kick and you notice him run his

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:09.550 
a free-kick and you notice him run his
player<00:03:07.670> back<00:03:07.880> there<00:03:08.090> us<00:03:08.720> and<00:03:09.080> you<00:03:09.140> want<00:03:09.380> to<00:03:09.470> use

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:09.560 
player back there us and you want to use

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:11.500

the<00:03:09.709> play<00:03:09.890> that<00:03:10.010> you<00:03:10.070> originally<00:03:10.280> have<00:03:10.700> to<00:03:10.970> you

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:11.510 
the play that you originally have to you

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:12.880 
the play that you originally have to you
can<00:03:11.660> just<00:03:11.690> switch<00:03:12.050> to<00:03:12.080> a<00:03:12.260> random<00:03:12.500> and<00:03:12.800> then

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:12.890 
can just switch to a random and then

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:14.710 
can just switch to a random and then
switch<00:03:13.190> right<00:03:13.400> back<00:03:13.580> that<00:03:13.820> originally<00:03:14.660> got

00:03:14.710 --> 00:03:14.720 
switch right back that originally got

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:16.539 
switch right back that originally got
real<00:03:14.930> quick<00:03:15.170> and<00:03:15.410> then<00:03:15.470> just<00:03:16.070> make<00:03:16.220> sure<00:03:16.430> you

germany<00:03:32.450> as<00:03:32.570> about<00:03:32.810> average<00:03:33.680> stats<00:03:33.950> i<00:03:34.100> think

00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:34.250 
germany as about average stats i think

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:36.820 
germany as about average stats i think
he's<00:03:34.340> got<00:03:34.400> like<00:03:34.580> 80<00:03:34.790> pace<00:03:35.110> he's<00:03:36.110> got<00:03:36.260> like<00:03:36.380> 70

00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:36.830 
he's got like 80 pace he's got like 70

very many good left-backs actually in
the<00:03:40.700> Bundesliga<00:03:41.180> he's<00:03:41.360> probably<00:03:41.570> like<00:03:41.810> the

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:42.230 
the Bundesliga he's probably like the

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:44.199 
the Bundesliga he's probably like the
better<00:03:42.380> ones<00:03:42.680> alarms<00:03:43.310> are<00:03:43.430> right<00:03:43.579> back<00:03:43.790> and<00:03:44.060> I

00:03:44.199 --> 00:03:44.209 
better ones alarms are right back and I

00:03:44.209 --> 00:03:45.930 
better ones alarms are right back and I
didn't<00:03:44.510> see<00:03:44.600> any<00:03:44.720> other<00:03:44.780> good<00:03:44.959> left<00:03:45.200> backs

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:45.940

didn't see any other good left backs
after<00:03:46.940> that<00:03:47.030> I<00:03:47.090> was<00:03:47.180> looking<00:03:47.420> for<00:03:47.660> a<00:03:47.690> new

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:48.320

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:04.160 
strike your sunny 9 overall and it'll be

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:05.440 
strike your sunny 9 overall and it'll be
good<00:04:04.190> for<00:04:04.370> the<00:04:04.549> chemistry<00:04:04.970> I<00:04:05.030> was<00:04:05.180> hoping<00:04:05.299> but

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:05.450 
good for the chemistry I was hoping but

00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:07.120 
good for the chemistry I was hoping but
then<00:04:05.660> I<00:04:05.690> remembered<00:04:05.959> that<00:04:06.140> my<00:04:06.530> son<00:04:06.799> attacking

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:07.130 
then I remembered that my son attacking

00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:09.520 
then I remembered that my son attacking
mid<00:04:07.280> and<00:04:07.459> striker<00:04:08.000> both<00:04:08.420> actually<00:04:08.870> Japanese

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:09.530 
mid and striker both actually Japanese

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:11.410 
mid and striker both actually Japanese
in<00:04:09.680> Nigerian<00:04:10.130> so<00:04:10.340> didn't<00:04:11.030> really<00:04:11.180> matter<00:04:11.329> that

00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:11.420 
in Nigerian so didn't really matter that

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:13.720 
in Nigerian so didn't really matter that
he<00:04:11.600> was<00:04:11.720> German<00:04:11.930> but<00:04:12.400> eventually<00:04:13.400> i'll<00:04:13.640> be

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:13.730 
he was German but eventually i'll be

00:04:13.730 --> 00:04:14.949 
he was German but eventually i'll be
getting<00:04:13.820> a<00:04:13.940> german<00:04:14.269> manager<00:04:14.630> so<00:04:14.780> that<00:04:14.810> will

00:04:14.949 --> 00:04:14.959 
getting a german manager so that will

00:04:14.959 --> 00:04:18.099 
getting a german manager so that will
help<00:04:15.079> the<00:04:15.260> chemistry<00:04:15.650> of<00:04:15.709> 200<00:04:16.160> and<00:04:16.900> as<00:04:17.900> you

00:04:18.099 --> 00:04:18.109 
help the chemistry of 200 and as you

00:04:18.109 --> 00:04:19.270 
help the chemistry of 200 and as you
