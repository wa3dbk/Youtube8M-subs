00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:25.020
 allows you to remove 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:27.090
 odors from the multicooker if it is some 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:30.450
 time is not used or you are allowed 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:35.570

 stand for steaming and 

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:57.300
 bowl 

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:57.780
 means the total amount of multicooker we have 4 

00:01:57.300 --> 00:02:00.990
 liter 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:03.150
 the volume of the bowl I mean flying usable volume 

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:04.890
 we have three liters bowl made of 

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:07.860
 anodized aluminum with non-stick 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:09.570
 coated with daikin 

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:12.090
 I also want to draw your attention to the fact that 

00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:15.480
 the bowl cover is made in the shape of a honeycomb 

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:18.900
 allows you to more evenly distribute 

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:21.150
 the heat inside the bowl is very yes but it is not yet 

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:23.130
 all feature multicooker stadler form 

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:26.820
 the fact that she has 2 heating elements 

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:29.910
 one on top another bottom and this allows 

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:32.070
 do 3d heat and from 2 you whose account 

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:35.640
 many competitors are here 

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:37.830
 the advantage of this hour is this disk 

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:40.470
 removable then it can be easily pulled out 

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:42.780
 because itâ€™s also easy to wash 

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:44.940
 back insert now we have summer 

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:47.910
 the weather is hot according to 

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:50.580
 and I think we will cook today 

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:55.160
 a lot of fresh vegetables and fruits 

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:57.299
 apples dough begin to proceed 

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:58.769
 what we need for cooking 

00:02:57.299 --> 00:03:05.040
 of this charlotte 

00:02:58.769 --> 00:03:08.150
 dough dough is 4 eggs sugar is all 

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:11.519
 stir and add a glass of flour 

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:15.290
 green apples peeled and chopped 

00:03:11.519 --> 00:03:17.970
 cubes could be red and by the way 

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:20.610
 apples can be any color important 

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:25.280
 so they were up to proceed to 

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:25.280
 getting started means laying apples 

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:30.650
 dough of course 

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:37.390
 can 

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:40.819
 and pour dough we laid out apples 

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:43.910
 evenly filled them with dough and anatolia 

00:03:40.819 --> 00:03:46.599
 what mode do we expose 

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:51.800
 baking mode 

00:03:46.599 --> 00:03:55.459
 so we have it only automatic 

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:58.130
 we will need to set the time what 

00:03:55.459 --> 00:04:01.130
 time we need well i think if here 

00:03:58.130 --> 00:04:03.739
 3d mode means time we need maximum 

00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:06.739

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:16.090
