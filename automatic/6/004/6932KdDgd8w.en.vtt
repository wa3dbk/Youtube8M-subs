appreciating<00:05:21.350> his<00:05:21.560> work<00:05:21.770> anymore<00:05:22.100> either<00:05:22.580> so

00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:23.450 
appreciating his work anymore either so

00:05:23.450 --> 00:05:27.520 
appreciating his work anymore either so
we<00:05:23.690> weren't<00:05:23.930> on<00:05:24.320> the<00:05:25.100> cusp<00:05:25.370> and<00:05:25.840> literally<00:05:26.840> we

00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:27.530 
we weren't on the cusp and literally we

00:05:27.530 --> 00:05:29.740 
we weren't on the cusp and literally we
both<00:05:27.950> had<00:05:28.370> reached<00:05:28.640> out<00:05:28.940> to<00:05:28.970> each<00:05:29.180> other<00:05:29.450> at

00:05:29.740 --> 00:05:29.750 
both had reached out to each other at

00:05:29.750 --> 00:05:32.500 
both had reached out to each other at
the<00:05:29.900> same<00:05:30.140> time<00:05:30.530> like<00:05:31.100> this<00:05:31.430> needs<00:05:31.910> to<00:05:32.090> be<00:05:32.180> done

00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:32.510 
the same time like this needs to be done

00:05:32.510 --> 00:05:34.750 
the same time like this needs to be done
then<00:05:33.440> that's<00:05:33.980> actually<00:05:34.160> a<00:05:34.430> good<00:05:34.700> thing

00:05:34.750 --> 00:05:34.760 
then that's actually a good thing

00:05:34.760 --> 00:05:37.950 
then that's actually a good thing
because<00:05:35.630> certain<00:05:36.260> things<00:05:36.560> in<00:05:37.460> life

00:05:37.950 --> 00:05:37.960 
because certain things in life

00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:40.030 
because certain things in life
friendships<00:05:38.960> things<00:05:39.260> like<00:05:39.470> that<00:05:39.650> aren't
