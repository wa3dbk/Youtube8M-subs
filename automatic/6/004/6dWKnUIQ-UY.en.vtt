00:00:08.310 --> 00:00:14.580
 lady, sir, this stew is carbonated 

00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:17.040
 it is spectacular the pumpkin long all 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:20.160
 the sweet the same as the dried apricots 

00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:23.220
 peach and damask but aside there 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:26.669
 we have the rice starch because 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:29.310
 you someone offers your company your 

00:00:26.669 --> 00:00:32.700
 friendship your affection and massage it with the 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:35.130
 wooden spoon stirring talk with 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:36.360
 the scream befriends and then he 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:38.790
 eat 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:41.010
 and he answers, I'm worried he's spent 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:44.090
 there is a dialogue already yielded a lot in 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:46.520
 joke to me they have spoken to me the stews 

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:48.290
 but of course if the corn that 

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:50.920
 it also gives a taste and a color this 

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:53.360
 formidable and the meat you need 

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:56.120
 approximately between 45 to 50 minutes 

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:58.520
 so that it gets tender tenderly 

00:00:56.120 --> 00:01:01.070
 remember that it was a palette a needle a 

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:03.559
 Robin cut into cubes previously 

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:05.869
 golden and in the same pan once 

00:01:03.559 --> 00:01:07.790
 that the pain and removed the meat goes with the 

00:01:05.869 --> 00:01:10.280
 vegetables with onion with onion 

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:13.220
 green with the pepper after incorporating 

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:15.320
 the rice incorporates the marked meat and 

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:17.690
 really there we have the saying that it is 

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:20.509
 super super rich then in spend 

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:22.970
 will begin to plate we will pay the 

00:01:20.509 --> 00:01:25.369
 country having bowls saw how cute they are 

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:27.870
 of mud are very cute very very clever 

00:01:25.369 --> 00:01:31.400
 then one there 

00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:35.130
 and it puts it regulates of course the 

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:38.040
 stew density with two systems per 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:40.830
 one side has this mine that pretty saws 

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:43.970
 this house full of broth if you see that 

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:47.220
 it is absorbing it evaporates 

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:49.650
 the liquid someone I am still rice 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:52.620
 it is raw and it lacks good there 

00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:55.590
 adds another broth the system is to do it 

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:57.630
 a pot uncovered if a stage generates 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:02:00.420
 steam and the liquid is contained if 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:02.880
 uncovers the liquid evaporates so what 

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:05.460
 we are going to place slowly and because 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:08.250
