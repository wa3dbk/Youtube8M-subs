00:00:40.879 --> 00:00:45.260

 I listen to you start learning Ukrainian 

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:49.670
 the language between here attracts you 

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:51.979
 and how the TV presenter thought about it but 

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:53.899
 and I told you they do nâ€™t have 

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:56.180
 I have the same roots of Ukrainian I 

00:00:53.899 --> 00:00:58.850
 grandmother in the village under the Poltava 

00:00:56.180 --> 00:01:01.460
 born therefore in general somewhere else 

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:03.199
 one quarter of my heart I'm 

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:05.330
 Ukrainian roots we are not with you 

00:01:03.199 --> 00:01:06.830
 have seen a new wave for half a year and just 

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:08.690
 after a new wave it became known that you 

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:10.369
 with lera no longer together we are now 

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:13.039
 continue to enter the new year together 

00:01:10.369 --> 00:01:14.960
 corporate parties together brought the song of the year 

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:16.789
 have you keep dating 

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:18.890
 exclusively for work I can say 

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:22.340
 hours that was for the period after the new wave 

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:24.170
 when I personally paused in our 

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:26.200
 relationships and in our in our communication 

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:28.880
 two and a half months exactly that is 

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:30.319
 I did not get in touch for me 

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:32.569
 there were at least two months so that all 

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:35.119
 realize understand and somehow with new with 

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:37.399
 new forces to communicate further and you all 

00:01:35.119 --> 00:01:39.770
 still painful to meet with lira or have 

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:41.479
 you don't have time then she has it 

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:44.569
 time we will still have shooting ahead 

00:01:41.479 --> 00:01:45.700
 we do not have a lot of corporate space 

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:47.599
 david only 

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:50.390
 television and big projects and 

00:01:47.599 --> 00:01:54.619
 corporate weddings I do not lead there I sing 

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:56.599
 if it is necessary as for our communication 

00:01:54.619 --> 00:01:59.330
 she happens she but without any 

00:01:56.599 --> 00:02:01.610
 conflicts without scandals cooler and now 

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:06.170
 new relationships began in my opinion 

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:08.060
 very soon so quickly but nokiyu that lera 

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:10.300
 Kudryavtseva can marry so quickly 

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:12.739
 she hasn't gotten married yet 

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:16.040
 going to marry she because of me 

00:02:12.739 --> 00:02:18.170
 I played what I wish her to keep that 

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:20.269
 that we could not save at 

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:21.500
 as much as possible to protect this relationship 

00:02:20.269 --> 00:02:23.330
 do not stand 

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:27.020
 from the hut, too, I personally do not welcome a 

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:28.820
 that I started to see it so much now in 

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:30.350
 I order the magazine does not accept countries 

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:32.630
 how our history looked like when with 

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:34.880
 each with each cover we together it 

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:37.190
 all fools and idiots so impossible 

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:38.360
 that you appeared so much in the press in 

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:41.000
 some time they started saying that it was 

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:42.950
 only pr-campaign of you two 

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.660
 no matter what happens now 

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:46.790
 most with their couple because he is the same 

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:48.700
 younger just ran what was he like there 

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:51.590
 the difference is so big lasers where 1 frame 

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:54.620
 there is even more like it so I 

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:56.090
 Well, drag love and I will try 

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:58.700
 enjoy as much as possible 

00:02:56.090 --> 00:03:00.830
 if you are invited to sing lera's wedding 

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:02.750
 kudryavtsev 200 time score we'll see 

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:04.700
 decided to enter the calibration for free will 

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:07.010
 he himself is not the troops that free will be new 

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:09.860
 maintain accurate and yet I will not come 

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:11.750
 singing and not so much the fact that the ice yet 

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:13.370
 No, I'm just not on this topic of the track 

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:15.980
 talked than the thing did you really 

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:18.110
 not when you're curious to see whether you become 

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:20.060
 years it's true when the former climbs in 

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:22.459
 Regarding the present it is somehow strange 

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:23.810
 In my opinion it is necessary to yourself I'm a man I'm 

00:03:22.459 --> 00:03:25.640
 should hold correctly 

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:28.780
 so it seems to me and now is not very 

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:28.780
 that's right, I'm talking about it
