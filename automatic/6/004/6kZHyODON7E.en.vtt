the guy that was bald the ball felon is

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:44.000 
the guy that was bald the ball felon is
also<00:00:42.360> so<00:00:43.170> it's<00:00:43.320> it's<00:00:43.559> a<00:00:43.649> great<00:00:43.829> accomplishment

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.010 
also so it's it's a great accomplishment

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:45.229 
also so it's it's a great accomplishment
but<00:00:44.399> at<00:00:44.520> the<00:00:44.579> same<00:00:44.700> time<00:00:44.850> we<00:00:45.000> got<00:00:45.120> to<00:00:45.180> move

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 
but at the same time we got to move

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:47.600 
but at the same time we got to move
forward<00:00:45.539> what's<00:00:46.379> most<00:00:46.649> impressive<00:00:46.950> about<00:00:47.309> the

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
forward what's most impressive about the

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:49.490 
forward what's most impressive about the
record<00:00:47.940> is<00:00:48.059> he's<00:00:48.180> only<00:00:48.390> in<00:00:48.539> his<00:00:48.600> third<00:00:49.020> of<00:00:49.230> five

years of eligibility boy he's been

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:55.130 
years of eligibility boy he's been
amazing<00:00:53.670> in<00:00:53.789> so<00:00:53.820> many<00:00:54.180> ways<00:00:54.420> it's<00:00:54.750> hard<00:00:54.989> to
