recording<00:00:21.789> guitars<00:00:22.150> when<00:00:22.449> I<00:00:22.480> want<00:00:22.750> to<00:00:22.840> record

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:22.990 
recording guitars when I want to record

00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:26.640 
recording guitars when I want to record
the<00:00:23.800> the<00:00:24.400> DI<00:00:24.609> alongside<00:00:25.240> the<00:00:25.930> signal<00:00:26.470> from<00:00:26.560> the

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:26.650 
the the DI alongside the signal from the

00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:28.800 
the the DI alongside the signal from the
amp<00:00:26.920> so<00:00:27.820> here<00:00:27.970> I've<00:00:28.029> got<00:00:28.180> a<00:00:28.210> song<00:00:28.449> in<00:00:28.600> Pro<00:00:28.779> Tools

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:28.810 
amp so here I've got a song in Pro Tools

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:31.500 
amp so here I've got a song in Pro Tools
just<00:00:29.320> a<00:00:29.439> just<00:00:29.740> a<00:00:29.830> quick<00:00:30.039> little<00:00:30.240> rock<00:00:31.240> riff

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:31.510 
just a just a quick little rock riff

00:00:31.510 --> 00:00:37.010 
just a just a quick little rock riff
here

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:37.020 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:43.640 

got<00:00:37.620> the<00:00:37.890> guitar<00:00:38.280> amp<00:00:38.820> signal

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:43.650 

00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:47.220 

and<00:00:44.650> then<00:00:44.830> the<00:00:45.070> guitar<00:00:45.430> di<00:00:45.820> signal<00:00:46.330> so<00:00:47.140> the

00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:47.230 
and then the guitar di signal so the

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:48.840 
and then the guitar di signal so the
reason<00:00:47.350> I<00:00:47.500> recorded<00:00:47.860> di<00:00:48.010> separate<00:00:48.550> is<00:00:48.670> if<00:00:48.760> I

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:48.850 
reason I recorded di separate is if I

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:51.030 
reason I recorded di separate is if I
want<00:00:49.060> to<00:00:49.150> re-amp<00:00:49.390> at<00:00:49.570> a<00:00:49.660> later<00:00:49.930> time<00:00:50.020> or<00:00:50.800> if<00:00:50.890> I

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:51.040 
want to re-amp at a later time or if I

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:54.150 
want to re-amp at a later time or if I
want<00:00:51.070> to<00:00:51.600> if<00:00:52.600> I<00:00:52.750> wanted<00:00:52.990> to<00:00:53.080> edit<00:00:53.230> the<00:00:53.740> the

00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:54.160 
want to if I wanted to edit the the

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:56.190 
want to if I wanted to edit the the
guitar<00:00:54.460> and<00:00:54.670> make<00:00:54.850> it<00:00:54.970> really<00:00:55.120> tight<00:00:55.240> on<00:00:55.480> onto

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:56.200 
guitar and make it really tight on onto

00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:57.960 
guitar and make it really tight on onto
onto<00:00:56.740> a<00:00:56.890> grid<00:00:57.190> or<00:00:57.340> something<00:00:57.580> like<00:00:57.670> that<00:00:57.730> it's

00:00:57.960 --> 00:00:57.970 
onto a grid or something like that it's

00:00:57.970 --> 00:00:59.610 
onto a grid or something like that it's
easier<00:00:58.240> to<00:00:58.360> see<00:00:58.570> or<00:00:58.900> if<00:00:59.020> I<00:00:59.140> want<00:00:59.170> to<00:00:59.410> put<00:00:59.560> an

00:00:59.610 --> 00:00:59.620 
easier to see or if I want to put an

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:02.160 
easier to see or if I want to put an
effect<00:00:59.980> pedal<00:01:00.340> on<00:01:00.520> it<00:01:00.700> at<00:01:00.820> some<00:01:01.030> point<00:01:01.170> I've

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:02.170 
effect pedal on it at some point I've

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:06.000 
effect pedal on it at some point I've
got<00:01:02.350> the<00:01:02.440> clean<00:01:02.710> di<00:01:02.950> to<00:01:03.700> do<00:01:03.880> that<00:01:04.059> with<00:01:05.010> while

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:06.010 
got the clean di to do that with while

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:07.320 
got the clean di to do that with while
you're<00:01:06.250> tracking<00:01:06.550> while<00:01:07.030> you're<00:01:07.150> editing

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:07.330 
you're tracking while you're editing

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:10.770 
you're tracking while you're editing
basically<00:01:08.110> that's<00:01:08.320> just<00:01:08.560> there<00:01:09.400> just<00:01:09.750> in<00:01:10.750> case

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:10.780 
basically that's just there just in case

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:12.420 
basically that's just there just in case
you<00:01:11.110> need<00:01:11.290> it<00:01:11.320> I<00:01:11.560> don't<00:01:11.830> want<00:01:11.950> to<00:01:12.010> be<00:01:12.070> listening

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:12.430 
you need it I don't want to be listening

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:15.270 
you need it I don't want to be listening
to<00:01:12.580> it<00:01:12.730> so<00:01:13.030> what<00:01:13.630> I<00:01:13.660> do<00:01:13.780> is<00:01:13.930> what<00:01:14.740> I<00:01:14.770> used<00:01:15.010> to<00:01:15.100> do

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:15.280 
to it so what I do is what I used to do

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:19.710 
to it so what I do is what I used to do
is<00:01:15.460> I'd<00:01:15.970> used<00:01:16.270> to<00:01:16.690> mono<00:01:17.320> tracks<00:01:18.030> 1<00:01:19.030> the<00:01:19.270> amp<00:01:19.420> one

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:19.720 
is I'd used to mono tracks 1 the amp one

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:21.620 
is I'd used to mono tracks 1 the amp one
the<00:01:19.810> DI<00:01:19.990> and<00:01:20.260> then<00:01:20.350> I<00:01:20.410> would<00:01:20.560> just<00:01:20.740> mute<00:01:20.979> the<00:01:21.130> DI

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
the DI and then I would just mute the DI

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:24.210 
the DI and then I would just mute the DI
as<00:01:22.630> you<00:01:22.840> can<00:01:22.930> see<00:01:23.140> my<00:01:23.290> inputs<00:01:23.650> here<00:01:23.710> I've<00:01:24.010> got

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:24.220 
as you can see my inputs here I've got

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:27.570 
as you can see my inputs here I've got
one<00:01:24.970> and<00:01:25.330> two<00:01:25.960> different<00:01:26.770> signals<00:01:27.100> obviously

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:27.580 
one and two different signals obviously

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:30.000 
one and two different signals obviously
I<00:01:27.790> stumbled<00:01:28.780> upon<00:01:28.869> this<00:01:29.200> little<00:01:29.650> trick<00:01:29.979> that

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:30.010 
I stumbled upon this little trick that

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:32.160 
I stumbled upon this little trick that
actually<00:01:30.550> helped<00:01:30.910> me<00:01:31.060> quite<00:01:31.360> a<00:01:31.420> bit<00:01:31.540> in<00:01:31.780> terms

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:32.170 
actually helped me quite a bit in terms

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:33.960 
actually helped me quite a bit in terms
of<00:01:32.380> my<00:01:32.560> session<00:01:33.070> management<00:01:33.400> and<00:01:33.729> just<00:01:33.850> my

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:33.970 
of my session management and just my

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:35.730 
of my session management and just my
workflow<00:01:34.450> and<00:01:34.780> being<00:01:34.960> able<00:01:35.050> to<00:01:35.260> do<00:01:35.380> various

00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:35.740 
workflow and being able to do various

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:37.859 
workflow and being able to do various
things<00:01:35.830> and<00:01:36.340> keeping<00:01:36.970> things<00:01:37.240> neat<00:01:37.510> and<00:01:37.540> tidy

00:01:37.859 --> 00:01:37.869 
things and keeping things neat and tidy

00:01:37.869 --> 00:01:41.730 
things and keeping things neat and tidy
and<00:01:38.260> that<00:01:38.950> trick<00:01:39.250> is<00:01:39.430> to<00:01:39.600> utilize<00:01:40.600> a<00:01:41.080> stereo

00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:41.740 
and that trick is to utilize a stereo

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:45.330 
and that trick is to utilize a stereo
track<00:01:41.820> to<00:01:42.820> put<00:01:42.850> both<00:01:43.450> of<00:01:43.479> these<00:01:44.160> both<00:01:45.160> of<00:01:45.190> these

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:45.340 
track to put both of these both of these

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:48.270 
track to put both of these both of these
clips<00:01:45.729> on<00:01:45.940> to<00:01:46.500> and<00:01:47.500> then<00:01:47.620> actually<00:01:47.830> once<00:01:48.160> I

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:48.280 
clips on to and then actually once I

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:49.830 
clips on to and then actually once I
started<00:01:48.550> doing<00:01:48.700> that<00:01:48.970> I<00:01:49.030> ended<00:01:49.450> up<00:01:49.600> just

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:49.840 
started doing that I ended up just

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:52.230 
started doing that I ended up just
starting<00:01:50.200> to<00:01:50.290> record<00:01:50.680> onto<00:01:51.370> the<00:01:51.490> stereo<00:01:51.880> track

00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:52.240 
starting to record onto the stereo track

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:53.790 
starting to record onto the stereo track
instead<00:01:52.540> of<00:01:52.750> recording<00:01:53.050> onto<00:01:53.350> two<00:01:53.590> mono

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:53.800 
instead of recording onto two mono

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:56.310 
instead of recording onto two mono
tracks<00:01:54.130> and<00:01:54.340> then<00:01:54.430> changing<00:01:54.850> later<00:01:55.210> so<00:01:55.480> let<00:01:56.200> me

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:56.320 
tracks and then changing later so let me

00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:58.050 
tracks and then changing later so let me
show<00:01:56.650> you<00:01:56.680> what<00:01:56.950> I<00:01:56.980> mean<00:01:57.070> and<00:01:57.550> then<00:01:57.640> once<00:01:57.910> you

00:01:58.050 --> 00:01:58.060 
show you what I mean and then once you

00:01:58.060 --> 00:01:59.910 
show you what I mean and then once you
figure<00:01:58.360> out<00:01:58.390> the<00:01:58.870> concept<00:01:59.380> you<00:01:59.470> can<00:01:59.590> apply<00:01:59.860> it

00:01:59.910 --> 00:01:59.920 
figure out the concept you can apply it

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:01.260 
figure out the concept you can apply it
to<00:02:00.100> a<00:02:00.130> bunch<00:02:00.340> of<00:02:00.520> different<00:02:00.820> things<00:02:01.030> and<00:02:01.180> I'll

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:01.270 
to a bunch of different things and I'll

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:03.840 
to a bunch of different things and I'll
actually<00:02:01.620> post<00:02:02.620> a<00:02:02.740> few<00:02:02.920> other<00:02:03.100> examples<00:02:03.280> and

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:03.850 
actually post a few other examples and

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:05.940 
actually post a few other examples and
some<00:02:03.940> other<00:02:04.090> videos<00:02:04.450> of<00:02:04.710> examples<00:02:05.710> of<00:02:05.770> how<00:02:05.890> you

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:05.950 
some other videos of examples of how you

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:08.009 
some other videos of examples of how you
could<00:02:06.130> use<00:02:06.340> this<00:02:06.520> so<00:02:06.760> so<00:02:07.540> you<00:02:07.630> have<00:02:07.720> got<00:02:07.840> my<00:02:07.960> two

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:08.019 
could use this so so you have got my two

00:02:08.019 --> 00:02:10.440 
could use this so so you have got my two

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:04.740 
the amp on a left and then the DI on our

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:06.860 
the amp on a left and then the DI on our
right<00:03:04.950> first<00:03:05.610> of<00:03:05.730> all<00:03:05.880> we<00:03:06.120> want<00:03:06.300> to<00:03:06.390> the<00:03:06.480> amp<00:03:06.690> up

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:06.870 
right first of all we want to the amp up

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:08.720 
right first of all we want to the amp up
the<00:03:07.020> middle

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:08.730 
the middle

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:11.089 
the middle
I<00:03:08.819> don't<00:03:09.569> even<00:03:09.659> want<00:03:09.930> to<00:03:09.959> hear<00:03:10.200> the<00:03:10.349> DI<00:03:10.530> h1<00:03:10.980> it

00:03:11.089 --> 00:03:11.099 
I don't even want to hear the DI h1 it

00:03:11.099 --> 00:03:13.850 
I don't even want to hear the DI h1 it
muted<00:03:11.519> so<00:03:12.239> here's<00:03:12.569> where<00:03:12.900> the<00:03:13.140> fun<00:03:13.170> comes<00:03:13.349> in

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:13.860 
muted so here's where the fun comes in

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:17.089 
muted so here's where the fun comes in
to<00:03:14.760> go<00:03:14.879> up<00:03:14.940> to<00:03:15.030> your<00:03:15.090> inserts<00:03:15.510> and<00:03:15.720> you<00:03:16.709> select

00:03:17.089 --> 00:03:17.099 
to go up to your inserts and you select

00:03:17.099 --> 00:03:20.449 
to go up to your inserts and you select
a<00:03:17.280> multiple<00:03:18.060> mono<00:03:18.540> plug-in<00:03:19.470> and<00:03:20.069> I<00:03:20.250> use<00:03:20.430> the

00:03:20.449 --> 00:03:20.459 
a multiple mono plug-in and I use the

00:03:20.459 --> 00:03:23.539 
a multiple mono plug-in and I use the
trim<00:03:20.940> plug-in<00:03:21.450> because<00:03:21.720> it<00:03:21.810> lets<00:03:21.989> me<00:03:22.340> mute<00:03:23.340> and

00:03:23.539 --> 00:03:23.549 
trim plug-in because it lets me mute and

00:03:23.549 --> 00:03:25.039 
trim plug-in because it lets me mute and
adjust<00:03:23.970> the<00:03:24.060> volume<00:03:24.180> and<00:03:24.450> adjust<00:03:24.720> the<00:03:24.750> phase

00:03:25.039 --> 00:03:25.049 
adjust the volume and adjust the phase

00:03:25.049 --> 00:03:26.990 
adjust the volume and adjust the phase
so<00:03:25.620> I<00:03:25.650> usually<00:03:26.099> this<00:03:26.220> is<00:03:26.370> the<00:03:26.459> first<00:03:26.700> plug-in

00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:27.000 
so I usually this is the first plug-in

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:31.850 
so I usually this is the first plug-in
in<00:03:27.209> my<00:03:27.330> chain<00:03:27.599> what<00:03:27.810> I'm<00:03:27.930> doing<00:03:28.200> this<00:03:29.150> and<00:03:30.860> when

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:31.860 
in my chain what I'm doing this and when

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:33.650 
in my chain what I'm doing this and when
you<00:03:31.980> open<00:03:32.580> up<00:03:32.610> the<00:03:32.730> multiple<00:03:33.120> mono<00:03:33.299> there's<00:03:33.599> a

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:33.660 
you open up the multiple mono there's a

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:35.300 
you open up the multiple mono there's a
little<00:03:33.810> link<00:03:34.080> button<00:03:34.410> here<00:03:34.769> that's<00:03:34.950> usually

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:35.310 
little link button here that's usually

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:37.490 
little link button here that's usually
engaged<00:03:35.700> you<00:03:35.970> want<00:03:36.150> to<00:03:36.209> engage<00:03:36.599> that<00:03:37.110> and<00:03:37.319> what

00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:37.500 
engaged you want to engage that and what

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:39.710 
engaged you want to engage that and what
that<00:03:37.680> lets<00:03:37.890> you<00:03:38.040> do<00:03:38.310> is<00:03:38.610> it<00:03:39.060> lets<00:03:39.269> you<00:03:39.480> have

00:03:39.710 --> 00:03:39.720 
that lets you do is it lets you have

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:42.380 
that lets you do is it lets you have
different<00:03:40.560> settings<00:03:41.190> for<00:03:41.459> the<00:03:41.579> left<00:03:41.790> side<00:03:42.120> and

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:42.390 
different settings for the left side and

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:44.410 
different settings for the left side and
the<00:03:42.540> right<00:03:42.569> side<00:03:42.750> and<00:03:43.319> really<00:03:44.040> at<00:03:44.099> this<00:03:44.310> point

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:44.420 
the right side and really at this point

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:46.819 
the right side and really at this point
it's<00:03:45.420> just<00:03:45.690> it's<00:03:45.930> just<00:03:45.959> a<00:03:46.140> two<00:03:46.260> channel<00:03:46.290> track

00:03:46.819 --> 00:03:46.829 
it's just it's just a two channel track

00:03:46.829 --> 00:03:48.920 
it's just it's just a two channel track
left<00:03:47.220> and<00:03:47.400> right<00:03:47.549> is<00:03:47.760> just<00:03:48.060> a<00:03:48.150> label<00:03:48.359> we're<00:03:48.780> not

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:48.930 
left and right is just a label we're not

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:51.380 
left and right is just a label we're not
using<00:03:49.260> the<00:03:49.590> left<00:03:49.829> side<00:03:50.099> for<00:03:50.370> panning<00:03:50.940> left<00:03:50.970> and

00:06:00.020 --> 00:06:00.030 
mono track and here's one of the main

00:06:00.030 --> 00:06:01.480 
mono track and here's one of the main
reasons<00:06:00.479> and<00:06:00.630> this<00:06:00.720> is<00:06:00.810> actually<00:06:01.110> how<00:06:01.229> i

00:06:01.480 --> 00:06:01.490 
reasons and this is actually how i

00:06:01.490 --> 00:06:06.050 
reasons and this is actually how i
stumbled<00:06:02.490> upon<00:06:02.580> the<00:06:02.820> idea<00:06:03.090> to<00:06:03.419> do<00:06:03.900> this<00:06:04.940> like<00:06:05.940> I

00:06:06.050 --> 00:06:06.060 
stumbled upon the idea to do this like I

00:06:06.060 --> 00:06:08.420 
stumbled upon the idea to do this like I
said<00:06:06.120> now<00:06:06.509> I<00:06:06.810> set<00:06:07.229> up<00:06:07.349> I'll<00:06:07.560> set<00:06:07.979> up<00:06:08.009> the<00:06:08.099> stair

00:06:08.420 --> 00:06:08.430 
said now I set up I'll set up the stair

00:06:08.430 --> 00:06:10.370 
said now I set up I'll set up the stair
I'll<00:06:08.639> set<00:06:08.849> up<00:06:08.880> a<00:06:09.030> stereo<00:06:09.389> track<00:06:09.419> before<00:06:09.960> I<00:06:10.169> even

00:06:10.370 --> 00:06:10.380 
I'll set up a stereo track before I even

00:06:10.380 --> 00:06:12.800 
I'll set up a stereo track before I even
record<00:06:11.009> and<00:06:11.250> I<00:06:11.310> really<00:06:11.880> record<00:06:12.300> my<00:06:12.449> guitars

00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:12.810 
record and I really record my guitars

00:06:12.810 --> 00:06:16.219 
record and I really record my guitars
now<00:06:13.560> like<00:06:13.860> this<00:06:14.070> onto<00:06:14.550> a<00:06:14.580> stereo<00:06:15.060> track<00:06:15.229> which

00:06:16.219 --> 00:06:16.229 
now like this onto a stereo track which

00:06:16.229 --> 00:06:18.610 
now like this onto a stereo track which
is<00:06:16.259> with<00:06:16.440> the<00:06:16.560> right<00:06:16.710> side<00:06:16.949> the<00:06:17.190> DI<00:06:17.370> muted

00:06:18.610 --> 00:06:18.620 
is with the right side the DI muted

00:06:18.620 --> 00:06:21.469 
is with the right side the DI muted
whereas<00:06:19.620> you<00:06:19.800> I<00:06:20.070> used<00:06:20.220> to<00:06:20.370> basically<00:06:20.909> do<00:06:21.360> it

00:06:21.469 --> 00:06:21.479 
whereas you I used to basically do it

00:06:21.479 --> 00:06:23.750 
whereas you I used to basically do it
separate<00:06:21.840> and<00:06:22.020> then<00:06:22.320> put<00:06:23.190> it<00:06:23.279> on<00:06:23.400> the<00:06:23.550> stereo

00:06:23.750 --> 00:06:23.760 
separate and then put it on the stereo

00:06:23.760 --> 00:06:25.670 
separate and then put it on the stereo
track<00:06:24.090> just<00:06:24.240> to<00:06:24.450> make<00:06:24.750> it<00:06:24.779> easier<00:06:25.139> but<00:06:25.320> I<00:06:25.440> just

00:06:25.670 --> 00:06:25.680 
track just to make it easier but I just

00:06:25.680 --> 00:06:27.050 
track just to make it easier but I just
record<00:06:25.979> onto<00:06:26.159> it<00:06:26.250> now<00:06:26.310> it's<00:06:26.610> part<00:06:26.880> of

00:06:27.050 --> 00:06:27.060
