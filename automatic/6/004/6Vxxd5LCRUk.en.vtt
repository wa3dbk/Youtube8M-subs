to the Civic Center we needed equipment

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:48.310 
to the Civic Center we needed equipment
that<00:00:46.159> could<00:00:46.339> work<00:00:46.730> in<00:00:46.940> tight<00:00:47.150> spaces

00:00:48.310 --> 00:00:48.320 
that could work in tight spaces

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:50.860 
that could work in tight spaces
yet<00:00:48.829> the<00:00:49.280> equipment<00:00:49.730> had<00:00:49.879> to<00:00:49.909> be<00:00:50.059> a<00:00:50.180> strong

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:50.870 
yet the equipment had to be a strong

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:53.380 
yet the equipment had to be a strong
enough<00:00:51.170> or<00:00:51.470> certainly<00:00:52.089> functional<00:00:53.089> enough

00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:53.390 
enough or certainly functional enough

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:55.000 
enough or certainly functional enough
that<00:00:53.600> it<00:00:53.720> can<00:00:53.870> be<00:00:53.989> used<00:00:54.260> in<00:00:54.589> these<00:00:54.710> tight

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:55.010

00:02:47.209 --> 00:02:49.330 
in the 37 years I've been in this
business<00:02:47.480> I've<00:02:48.170> always<00:02:48.560> been<00:02:48.709> amazed<00:02:49.040> how<00:02:49.280> the

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:49.340 
business I've always been amazed how the

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:51.160 
business I've always been amazed how the
machinery<00:02:49.790> could<00:02:50.060> make<00:02:50.239> such<00:02:50.450> a<00:02:50.480> difference

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:51.170 
machinery could make such a difference

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:53.170 
machinery could make such a difference
you<00:02:51.349> just<00:02:51.590> cannot<00:02:52.069> wait<00:02:52.340> around<00:02:52.819> while<00:02:53.150> a

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:53.180 
you just cannot wait around while a

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:56.440 
you just cannot wait around while a
machine<00:02:53.569> gets<00:02:53.810> gets<00:02:54.560> fixed<00:02:55.150> there's<00:02:56.150> really

00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:56.450 
machine gets gets fixed there's really

00:02:56.450 --> 00:02:58.809 
machine gets gets fixed there's really
you<00:02:56.780> can't<00:02:57.290> even<00:02:57.469> build<00:02:57.739> that<00:02:57.980> in<00:02:58.249> and<00:02:58.549> when

00:02:58.809 --> 00:02:58.819 
you can't even build that in and when

00:02:58.819 --> 00:03:00.910 
you can't even build that in and when
you're<00:02:58.969> estimating<00:02:59.329> so<00:03:00.200> you<00:03:00.260> got<00:03:00.530> to<00:03:00.709> have<00:03:00.889> a

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:00.920 
you're estimating so you got to have a

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:03.160 
you're estimating so you got to have a
machine<00:03:01.400> that<00:03:01.639> you<00:03:01.730> can<00:03:01.879> depend<00:03:02.180> on<00:03:02.389> and<00:03:02.689> it

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:03.170 
machine that you can depend on and it

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:04.929 
machine that you can depend on and it
functions<00:03:03.469> the<00:03:03.859> way<00:03:04.099> you<00:03:04.159> expect<00:03:04.760> it<00:03:04.879> to

00:03:04.929 --> 00:03:04.939 
functions the way you expect it to

00:03:04.939 --> 00:03:06.970 
functions the way you expect it to
function<00:03:05.510> I've<00:03:05.989> always<00:03:06.409> found<00:03:06.590> that<00:03:06.769> with

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:06.980 
function I've always found that with

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:27.790 
function I've always found that with
caterpillar<00:03:07.430> equipment

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:27.800 

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:31.380 

it's<00:03:28.430> just<00:03:28.610> a<00:03:28.670> workhorse
