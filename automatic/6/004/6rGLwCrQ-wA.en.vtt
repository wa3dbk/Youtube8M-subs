00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:36.440 
it also had a huge diversity you know
there<00:01:35.130> were<00:01:35.490> a<00:01:35.520> lot<00:01:35.729> of<00:01:35.759> bands<00:01:36.090> that<00:01:36.240> were

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
there were a lot of bands that were

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:38.030 
there were a lot of bands that were
popular<00:01:36.659> in<00:01:36.840> 80's<00:01:37.200> that<00:01:37.350> were<00:01:37.530> quite

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
popular in 80's that were quite

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:41.690 
popular in 80's that were quite
different<00:01:38.369> from<00:01:38.610> each<00:01:38.820> other<00:01:39.060> and<00:01:40.670> you<00:01:41.670> know

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 
different from each other and you know

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:44.030 
different from each other and you know
what<00:01:42.060> you<00:01:42.180> hear<00:01:42.360> on<00:01:42.420> the<00:01:42.600> radio<00:01:42.750> today<00:01:43.439> it

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:44.040 
what you hear on the radio today it

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:45.649 
what you hear on the radio today it
depends<00:01:44.430> on<00:01:44.460> what<00:01:44.610> radio<00:01:44.939> station<00:01:44.970> you<00:01:45.360> listen

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:45.659 
depends on what radio station you listen

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:47.149 
depends on what radio station you listen
to<00:01:45.750> you<00:01:45.930> can<00:01:46.079> often<00:01:46.439> hear<00:01:46.619> a<00:01:46.680> lot<00:01:46.829> of<00:01:46.950> groups

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 
to you can often hear a lot of groups

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:49.069 
to you can often hear a lot of groups
that<00:01:47.250> sound<00:01:47.579> very<00:01:47.880> similar<00:01:48.240> to<00:01:48.540> each<00:01:48.570> other<00:01:48.810> so

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:49.079 
that sound very similar to each other so

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:50.510 
that sound very similar to each other so
you<00:01:49.110> don't<00:01:49.320> have<00:01:49.409> the<00:01:49.560> diversity<00:01:50.009> that<00:01:50.369> you're

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
you don't have the diversity that you're

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:52.520 
you don't have the diversity that you're
hearing<00:01:50.700> in<00:01:50.970> mainstream<00:01:51.659> radio<00:01:51.840> you<00:01:52.259> got<00:01:52.380> to

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530 
hearing in mainstream radio you got to

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:55.850 
hearing in mainstream radio you got to
search<00:01:52.770> elsewhere<00:01:53.869> well<00:01:54.869> you<00:01:55.470> know<00:01:55.590> if<00:01:55.740> I

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860 
search elsewhere well you know if I

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:59.749 
search elsewhere well you know if I
could<00:01:55.920> find<00:01:56.219> a<00:01:56.399> record<00:01:56.729> shop<00:01:57.000> very<00:01:57.420> start<00:01:58.759> I

00:01:59.749 --> 00:01:59.759 
could find a record shop very start I

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:02.330 
could find a record shop very start I
would<00:02:00.689> probably<00:02:00.960> I'd<00:02:01.560> start<00:02:01.890> in<00:02:02.009> the<00:02:02.130> Jazz

00:02:05.319 --> 00:02:05.329 
section I'd be looking through to see

00:02:05.329 --> 00:02:08.089 
section I'd be looking through to see
you<00:02:06.329> know<00:02:06.479> if<00:02:06.750> any<00:02:07.140> particular<00:02:07.350> artists<00:02:08.009> that

00:02:12.309 --> 00:02:12.319 
recording that I'd not heard or maybe

00:02:12.319 --> 00:02:14.199 
recording that I'd not heard or maybe

00:02:14.199 --> 00:02:14.209 
had been recommended to me

00:02:14.209 --> 00:02:16.509 
had been recommended to me
Sean<00:02:14.629> Freeman<00:02:15.079> who<00:02:15.140> plays<00:02:15.349> sax<00:02:15.650> level<00:02:15.980> 42<00:02:16.250> he's

Sean Freeman who plays sax level 42 he's

00:02:16.519 --> 00:02:18.100 
Sean Freeman who plays sax level 42 he's
great<00:02:16.790> because<00:02:17.209> he's<00:02:17.360> always<00:02:17.540> sort<00:02:17.780> of<00:02:17.930> named

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:18.110 
great because he's always sort of named

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:20.860 
great because he's always sort of named
taking<00:02:18.500> great<00:02:19.040> recordings<00:02:19.640> you<00:02:20.450> know<00:02:20.569> from

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:20.870 
taking great recordings you know from

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:22.869 
taking great recordings you know from
like<00:02:21.140> people<00:02:21.829> like<00:02:21.920> Wayne<00:02:22.099> Shorter<00:02:22.519> and<00:02:22.640> so<00:02:22.760> on

00:02:22.869 --> 00:02:22.879 
like people like Wayne Shorter and so on

00:02:22.879 --> 00:02:25.210 
like people like Wayne Shorter and so on
that<00:02:23.000> I'd<00:02:23.120> never<00:02:23.349> you<00:02:24.349> know<00:02:24.470> come<00:02:24.739> across<00:02:25.040> or

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:25.220 
that I'd never you know come across or

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:27.309 
that I'd never you know come across or
have<00:02:25.430> a<00:02:25.459> chance<00:02:25.790> to<00:02:26.000> check<00:02:26.180> out<00:02:26.360> so<00:02:27.110> I<00:02:27.170> probably

00:02:27.309 --> 00:02:27.319 
have a chance to check out so I probably

00:02:27.319 --> 00:02:29.259 
have a chance to check out so I probably
start<00:02:27.680> there<00:02:27.890> and<00:02:28.129> then<00:02:28.310> I<00:02:28.489> probably<00:02:29.060> go<00:02:29.209> to

00:02:29.259 --> 00:02:29.269 
start there and then I probably go to

00:02:29.269 --> 00:02:32.259 
start there and then I probably go to
the<00:02:29.560> if<00:02:30.560> you<00:02:30.620> like<00:02:30.860> world's<00:02:31.430> music<00:02:31.730> section<00:02:32.120> I

00:02:32.259 --> 00:02:32.269 
the if you like world's music section I

00:02:32.269 --> 00:02:36.039 
the if you like world's music section I
check<00:02:32.510> in<00:02:32.629> African<00:02:33.110> Brazilian<00:02:34.209> and<00:02:35.209> then<00:02:35.870> I

00:02:36.039 --> 00:02:36.049 
check in African Brazilian and then I

00:02:36.049 --> 00:02:37.509 
check in African Brazilian and then I
would<00:02:36.260> next<00:02:36.530> probably<00:02:36.709> go<00:02:36.859> to<00:02:36.920> the<00:02:37.040> classical

00:02:37.509 --> 00:02:37.519 
would next probably go to the classical

00:02:37.519 --> 00:02:39.670 
would next probably go to the classical
section
