first thing I like to do is pull both
wheels<00:00:11.940> off<00:00:12.120> the<00:00:12.240> bike<00:00:12.450> that<00:00:13.170> gives<00:00:13.350> us<00:00:13.530> the

00:00:13.670 --> 00:00:13.680 
wheels off the bike that gives us the

00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:16.670 
wheels off the bike that gives us the
ability<00:00:13.740> to<00:00:14.219> clean<00:00:15.090> the<00:00:15.240> wheels<00:00:15.560> inspect<00:00:16.560> the

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:16.680 
ability to clean the wheels inspect the

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:19.279 
ability to clean the wheels inspect the
hubs<00:00:16.890> and<00:00:17.310> the<00:00:17.550> barians<00:00:18.150> in<00:00:18.240> the<00:00:18.330> hubs<00:00:18.510> for<00:00:18.660> any

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:19.289 
hubs and the barians in the hubs for any

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:22.220 
hubs and the barians in the hubs for any
play<00:00:19.590> and<00:00:19.890> then<00:00:20.699> that<00:00:20.850> will<00:00:21.119> let<00:00:21.720> us<00:00:21.750> be<00:00:22.050> able

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:22.230 
play and then that will let us be able

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:24.290 
play and then that will let us be able
to<00:00:22.350> true<00:00:22.530> the<00:00:22.650> wheels<00:00:22.850> which<00:00:23.850> is<00:00:23.970> basically

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:24.300 
to true the wheels which is basically

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:26.210 
to true the wheels which is basically
just<00:00:24.530> straightening<00:00:25.530> them<00:00:25.680> from<00:00:25.890> side<00:00:26.100> to

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:26.220 
just straightening them from side to

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:28.130 
just straightening them from side to
side<00:00:26.250> and<00:00:26.790> then<00:00:27.090> making<00:00:27.270> sure<00:00:27.390> there's<00:00:27.660> no<00:00:27.780> up

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:28.140 
side and then making sure there's no up

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:31.779 
side and then making sure there's no up
and<00:00:28.380> down<00:00:28.470> hops<00:00:28.830> in<00:00:29.039> the<00:00:29.100> wheels

00:00:31.779 --> 00:00:31.789 

00:00:31.789 --> 00:00:34.229 

now<00:00:32.509> the<00:00:32.570> wheels<00:00:32.989> have<00:00:33.140> been<00:00:33.260> taken<00:00:33.620> care<00:00:33.800> of

00:00:34.229 --> 00:00:34.239 
now the wheels have been taken care of

00:00:34.239 --> 00:00:36.819 
now the wheels have been taken care of
they're<00:00:35.239> straight<00:00:35.570> they're<00:00:35.840> clean<00:00:36.079> we<00:00:36.680> can

00:00:36.819 --> 00:00:36.829 
they're straight they're clean we can

00:00:36.829 --> 00:00:39.040 
they're straight they're clean we can
turn<00:00:37.280> our<00:00:37.309> attention<00:00:37.760> back<00:00:37.790> to<00:00:37.910> the<00:00:38.030> frame<00:00:38.360> so

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:39.050 
turn our attention back to the frame so

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:41.020 
turn our attention back to the frame so
first<00:00:39.440> thing<00:00:39.559> I<00:00:39.590> like<00:00:39.710> to<00:00:39.739> do<00:00:40.010> is<00:00:40.309> just<00:00:40.640> kind<00:00:40.940> of

00:00:43.479 --> 00:00:43.489 
the frame look good wipe down again

00:00:43.489 --> 00:00:45.610 
the frame look good wipe down again
makes<00:00:44.149> for<00:00:44.390> a<00:00:44.420> nice<00:00:44.570> clean<00:00:44.930> looking<00:00:45.230> brand<00:00:45.440> new

makes for a nice clean looking brand new

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:47.259 
makes for a nice clean looking brand new
bike<00:00:45.800> but<00:00:46.399> it<00:00:46.489> also<00:00:46.640> gives<00:00:46.910> us<00:00:47.030> time<00:00:47.239> to

00:00:47.259 --> 00:00:47.269 
bike but it also gives us time to

00:00:47.269 --> 00:00:50.079 
bike but it also gives us time to

so the next thing we want to check is
the<00:01:04.370> Craig<00:01:05.120> the<00:01:05.300> bottom<00:01:05.570> bracket<00:01:05.810> assembly<00:01:05.900> so

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:06.470 
the Craig the bottom bracket assembly so

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:08.290 
the Craig the bottom bracket assembly so
basically<00:01:06.740> what<00:01:06.890> we<00:01:06.950> want<00:01:07.070> to<00:01:07.160> do<00:01:07.280> is<00:01:07.970> we<00:01:08.120> just

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:08.300 
basically what we want to do is we just

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:09.850 
basically what we want to do is we just
want<00:01:08.420> to<00:01:08.480> grab<00:01:08.630> each<00:01:08.810> crank<00:01:09.080> arm<00:01:09.290> and<00:01:09.590> kind<00:01:09.800> of

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:09.860 
want to grab each crank arm and kind of

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:12.070 
want to grab each crank arm and kind of
give<00:01:09.980> it<00:01:10.010> a<00:01:10.130> side-to-side<00:01:10.690> weibull<00:01:11.690> that<00:01:11.960> way

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:12.080 
give it a side-to-side weibull that way

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:13.930 
give it a side-to-side weibull that way
we're<00:01:12.260> checking<00:01:12.590> for<00:01:12.680> any<00:01:12.770> lateral<00:01:13.100> you<00:01:13.820> know

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:13.940 
we're checking for any lateral you know

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:16.630 
we're checking for any lateral you know
looseness<00:01:14.870> in<00:01:15.410> the<00:01:15.650> bottom<00:01:15.890> bracket<00:01:16.190> bearings

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:16.640 
looseness in the bottom bracket bearings

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:19.000 
looseness in the bottom bracket bearings
bottom<00:01:17.480> bracket<00:01:17.570> here<00:01:17.840> feels<00:01:18.110> good<00:01:18.230> the<00:01:18.860> one

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:19.010 
bottom bracket here feels good the one

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:20.080 
bottom bracket here feels good the one
thing<00:01:19.130> will<00:01:19.280> probably<00:01:19.310> just<00:01:19.670> want<00:01:19.850> to<00:01:19.910> throw<00:01:20.000> a

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:20.090 
thing will probably just want to throw a

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:22.540 
thing will probably just want to throw a
wrench<00:01:20.120> on<00:01:20.480> is<00:01:20.690> the<00:01:21.470> crank<00:01:21.710> bolts<00:01:21.980> themselves

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:22.550 
wrench on is the crank bolts themselves

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:24.820 
wrench on is the crank bolts themselves
so<00:01:22.850> all<00:01:23.510> we<00:01:23.660> need<00:01:23.690> big<00:01:24.170> eight<00:01:24.410> millimeter

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:24.830 
so all we need big eight millimeter

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:28.030 
so all we need big eight millimeter
allen<00:01:25.460> head<00:01:25.850> wrench<00:01:26.230> and<00:01:27.230> basically<00:01:27.650> throw<00:01:27.920> it

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:28.040 
allen head wrench and basically throw it

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:30.910 
allen head wrench and basically throw it
end<00:01:28.220> grab<00:01:28.820> the<00:01:28.970> pedal<00:01:29.500> and<00:01:30.500> see<00:01:30.650> if<00:01:30.710> you<00:01:30.800> can

00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:30.920 
end grab the pedal and see if you can

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:32.710 
end grab the pedal and see if you can
get<00:01:31.040> anything<00:01:31.190> to<00:01:31.640> you<00:01:32.240> know<00:01:32.330> tighten<00:01:32.660> down

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:32.720 
get anything to you know tighten down

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:34.690 
get anything to you know tighten down
that<00:01:33.110> one<00:01:33.710> clutch<00:01:33.890> good<00:01:34.160> we'll<00:01:34.370> check<00:01:34.520> the

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:34.700 
that one clutch good we'll check the

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:41.800 
that one clutch good we'll check the
other<00:01:34.820> one<00:01:37.630> a<00:01:39.160> little<00:01:40.160> bit<00:01:40.369> loose<00:01:40.550> so<00:01:41.060> again

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:41.810 
other one a little bit loose so again

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:44.570 
other one a little bit loose so again
could<00:01:42.140> we<00:01:42.290> check<00:01:42.470> that

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:44.580 
could we check that

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:46.690 
could we check that
okay<00:01:45.420> so<00:01:45.510> lastly<00:01:45.960> probably<00:01:46.350> most<00:01:46.560> importantly

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:46.700 
okay so lastly probably most importantly

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:49.670 
okay so lastly probably most importantly
let's<00:01:47.700> check<00:01:47.940> the<00:01:48.180> tire<00:01:48.720> pressure<00:01:49.020> in<00:01:49.380> the

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:49.680 
let's check the tire pressure in the

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:52.100 
let's check the tire pressure in the
tires<00:01:49.860> on<00:01:50.220> this<00:01:50.820> standard<00:01:51.450> mountain<00:01:51.690> bike<00:01:51.840> if

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:52.110 
tires on this standard mountain bike if

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:54.230 
tires on this standard mountain bike if
we're<00:01:52.260> going<00:01:52.350> to<00:01:52.410> go<00:01:52.530> out<00:01:52.710> ride<00:01:53.430> the<00:01:53.580> trails<00:01:53.850> we

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:54.240 
we're going to go out ride the trails we
