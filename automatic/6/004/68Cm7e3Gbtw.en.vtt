00:00:01.970 --> 00:00:09.719
 Now we are at the earlier unity to 

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:11.809
 good where grows so small 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:15.089
 pretty plant called 

00:00:11.809 --> 00:00:17.390
 Veronica Dubravnaya is plants 

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:20.039
 small but remote 

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:21.170
 defeating such formidable diseases as 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:25.470
 fungi 

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:27.570
 surprisingly sad that these fungi 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:30.210
 develop everywhere they develop 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:32.489
 respiratory tract and on the skin and nails 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:36.860
 and even in the internal organs 

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:36.860
 having dangerously the first easy way themselves 

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:43.260
 dwell they were the leading fungi in 

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:47.219
 intestinal cavities and many people suffer 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:49.110
 from these fungi though our salvation here in 

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:52.320
 this beautiful grass called 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:53.300
 Veronica plants say a little but 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:56.340
 remote 

00:00:53.300 --> 00:01:00.539
 fees and and laborious but imagine 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:03.570
 But if you drink this grass as tea and tea 

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:06.990
 how do we make a spoonful of grass 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:08.790
 a glass of boiling water for about 30 minutes must be insisted 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:13.290
 so that the grass is steamed 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:16.950
 and this glass is divided into three parts 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:19.320
 need to drink in the morning for 10 minutes before meals for lunch 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:19.950
 and dinner and if you drink two or three weeks 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:24.210
 poison 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:28.829
 then in rows disappears both in the body and in 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:31.770
 blood and little by little and our nails will become 

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:32.479
 also clean plants going from 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:34.759
 land 

00:01:32.479 --> 00:01:39.720
 that's such a little stretch 

00:01:34.759 --> 00:01:42.750
 going to the beginning of flowering when the bottom 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:45.040
 Flowers bloomed and other flowers 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:49.000
 buds 

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:51.280
 the plant is to dry quickly necessarily 

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:55.480
 at a temperature of about 40 degrees then 

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:58.990
 is it frying a roof over here or is it 

00:01:55.480 --> 00:02:00.360
 some kind of well in the village dries the warmed 

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:04.410
 ovens 

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:08.220
 because the long carcass of this plant 

00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:10.260
 when in cold weather leads to the fact that 

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:12.610
 substances 

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:16.300
 disease-destroying fungal gri 

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:20.970
 fail to listen necessarily places 

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:26.470
 inaccessible for light but ventilated 

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:29.920
 rural environment is the roof of the shed here 

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:30.910
 under the roof of the barn or in the attic 

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:34.020
 country house 

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:34.020
 but under the iron roof
