00:00:00.199 --> 00:00:04.710
 Welcome to the fifth issue 

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:07.080
 of the bach shipyards today we introduce 

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:11.190
 you the Japanese 49 destroyers the 

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:14.190
 career before after their launch on 27 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:15.839
 september 1938 was the career too 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:18.660
 start only in connection with 

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:19.949
 other ships suitable for use 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:22.500
 one at the almost nonexistent 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:24.150
 air defense to the other but also to the 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:26.189
 lack of radar equipment was 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:29.130
 Both became in the following years 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:31.590
 improved or retrofitted in return 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:33.230
 However , the kg lost one of her 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:35.640
 three artillery towers 

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:37.980
 although they are at enemy because of their long 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:39.809
 lenz torpedoes so torpedoes with extreme 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:42.629
 high range was very much feared 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:44.579
 Eventually 18 of the 19 were built 

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:46.410
 Ships sunk most of them 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:48.870
 fell to enemy air raids 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:50.489
 sacrifice because despite being retrofitted aflac was 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:52.829
 the career is still very much the same 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:54.449
 vulnerable the last surviving ship 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:56.039
 the series went to the second 

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:58.800
 world war as war booty to the 

00:00:56.039 --> 00:01:00.500
 Chinese where it still in use until 1970 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:03.540
 do 

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:05.700
 the kg has three or two 

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:09.290
 artillery towers each with two 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:12.150
 cannons 127 mm are equipped 

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:15.960
 Then there are two torpedo throws 

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:19.640
 each 4 610 mm torpedoes in both 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:19.640
 directions of the ship 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:25.080
 as an air defense are several 25 mm 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:27.240
 Flak guns mounted the enemy 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:29.030
 aircraft from about three kilometers below 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:31.680
 take fire 

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:34.970
 but look enough of the dry theory 

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:34.970
 let's move on 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:41.940
 The kadyrov owns for a destroyer 

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:43.380
 an average acceleration 

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:45.780
 and with her 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:47.370
 final speed of 35 knots 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:49.530
 however, most other vessels 

00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:51.510
 this class is also inferior 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:53.480
 Armor and structure points is concerned 

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:55.650
 she rather lower mediocrity 

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:57.060
 therefore always move in the 

00:01:55.650 --> 00:01:59.520
 Connected with other ships 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:01.320
 so you increase your viability 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:02.940
 considerably that the opponent does not 

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:06.750
 only on you but on several ships 

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:08.880
 at the same time, the 

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:10.590
 artillery towers of kg and very 

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:12.300
 sedate have a pretty low 

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:14.090
 fire rate and caused 

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:16.320
 a lot of damage on average 

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:18.720
 but in return they are pretty 

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:21.650
 unerring and well-chosen 

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:21.650
 every shot is a hit 

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:28.310
 artillery duels with other destroyers 

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:30.380
 leads you therefore at eye level and 

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:32.240
 Ultimately, your own goal decides 

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:34.900
 Can ship about which ship first 

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:34.900
 goes down 

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:41.180
 slow-moving artillery may 

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:43.040
 The cadeaux require here, however 

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:44.780
 a bit of foresight then they are in the 

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:48.140
 Wrong direction have not turned any 

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:50.060
 possibility of becoming dueling with you 

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:52.160
 enemy cruiser you should do this 

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:53.840
 Get out of the way of your firepower 

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:55.940
 Hard to counter her 

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:57.020
 quite the contrary cruiser captains 

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:58.970
 Be about easy goals 

00:02:57.020 --> 00:03:03.620
 bonfires generally on you 

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:05.390
 concentrate your weak armor 

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:06.770
 there is no help for you here 

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:08.210
 an enemy cruiser on you 

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:10.130
 you can only shoot yourself 

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:11.990
 Imagine and hope that he is on time 

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:14.530
 but could often disappear 

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:17.300
 goes wrong 

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:20.860
 the really deadly weapon of attack 

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:23.480
 career, however, are the torpedoes 

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:25.519
 These are relatively slow 

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:28.220
 and have a loading time of over 

00:03:25.519 --> 00:03:30.470
 two minutes cause enormous 

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:31.760
 damage and thanks to the reach of 15 

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:35.170
 you do not even have to drive kilometers 

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:35.170
 especially close to the enemy 

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:42.560
 because the cargo is worth an extremely good 

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:43.909
 owns and only from 68 kilometers of 

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:46.129
 other ships is discovered 

00:03:43.909 --> 00:03:48.230
 Do you have the possibility of your paperwork? 

00:03:46.129 --> 00:03:50.510
 museum the opponents to years 

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:54.700
 then you lean back and watch 

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:54.700
 their deadly cargo sunk the enemy 

00:03:57.790 --> 00:04:02.900
 another big advantage of the topteams 

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:04.519
 the cargo is centered on the towers 

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:06.560
 are arranged and you thus the 

00:04:04.519 --> 00:04:07.760
 possibility off and all eight torpedoes in 

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:10.299
 same direction of the ship 

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:10.299
 fire 

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:18.930
 that would be the enemy ships in the 

00:04:16.799 --> 00:04:21.500
 melee a true inferno from top 

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:21.500
 teams against 

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:29.020
 and if you are still halfway 

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:32.040
 Neat goal of the opponent hardly more 

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:32.040
 to avoid a chance 

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:36.910
 main goals for your torpedoes should be 

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:38.110
 of course, enemy battleships 

00:04:36.910 --> 00:04:39.730
 and its aircraft carrier 

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:41.350
 pay close attention to this 

00:04:39.730 --> 00:04:43.030
 Range advantages tableaus 

00:04:41.350 --> 00:04:45.280
 play out and not too close ans 

00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:46.750
 approaching enemies already 

00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:48.610
 the sec and the artillery of some 

00:04:46.750 --> 00:04:50.260
 Battleships is strong enough for yours 

00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:53.700
 to move career faster than 

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:53.700
 orthopedist could meet 

00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:59.650
 then we summarize the career again 

00:04:56.590 --> 00:05:01.630
 In short, she is a destroyer 

00:04:59.650 --> 00:05:03.520
 its advantages clearly in the very 

00:05:01.630 --> 00:05:06.850
 high torpedo reach and the very 

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:08.230
 good values the artillery is 

00:05:06.850 --> 00:05:10.300
 unerringly enough to do it with others 

00:05:08.230 --> 00:05:12.580
 However, one has to take in destroyers 

00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:13.560
 low rate of fire and slow speed 

00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:16.060
 towers 

00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:17.950
 in addition an air defense comes the self 

00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:19.720
 is extremely bad for a destroyer 

00:05:17.950 --> 00:05:21.130
 you can do this through modules 

00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:22.990
 improve then you are however 

00:05:21.130 --> 00:05:24.750
 only two instead of three artillery 

00:05:22.990 --> 00:05:27.520
 Towers available 

00:05:24.750 --> 00:05:29.230
 the career is suitable thanks to the good 

00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:30.520
 downhill especially enemy 

00:05:29.230 --> 00:05:32.470
 battleships or aircraft carriers 

00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:32.980
 looked around with torpedoes under pressure too 

00:05:32.470 --> 00:05:34.870
 put 

00:05:32.980 --> 00:05:36.610
 any melee with other ships 

00:05:34.870 --> 00:05:40.060
 you should, however, as far as possible from the 

00:05:36.610 --> 00:05:41.470
 go away with this issue of the 

00:05:40.060 --> 00:05:43.480
 baw shipyards i hope you had fun 

00:05:41.470 --> 00:05:45.460
 while watching and listening and we see 

00:05:43.480 --> 00:05:48.240
 us in the next one then with the 

00:05:45.460 --> 00:05:52.470
 American 14th cruiser of the demo in 

00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:52.470
 this sense until next time
