00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:12.679 
we've used the same two mounting screws
for<00:01:09.450> our<00:01:09.630> shock<00:01:09.899> tower<00:01:10.200> as<00:01:10.700> dinky<00:01:11.700> RC<00:01:12.030> uses<00:01:12.450> for

00:01:12.679 --> 00:01:12.689 
for our shock tower as dinky RC uses for

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:14.300 
for our shock tower as dinky RC uses for
their<00:01:12.840> cantilever<00:01:13.439> suspension<00:01:13.920> kit<00:01:14.100> so

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
you can see the movement on that is just

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:25.910 
you can see the movement on that is just
fantastic<00:01:23.700> and<00:01:24.359> the<00:01:25.079> other<00:01:25.229> change<00:01:25.530> we<00:01:25.619> made

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920 
fantastic and the other change we made

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:27.529 
fantastic and the other change we made
there's<00:01:26.429> two<00:01:26.549> other<00:01:26.700> changes<00:01:27.119> that<00:01:27.270> we<00:01:27.359> made

to<00:01:40.409> give<00:01:40.529> us<00:01:40.560> a<00:01:40.770> little<00:01:40.979> different<00:01:41.219> suspension

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
to give us a little different suspension

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:43.399 
to give us a little different suspension
geometry<00:01:41.789> but<00:01:42.270> we've<00:01:42.420> also<00:01:42.659> got<00:01:42.840> the<00:01:43.170> drop

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:43.409 
geometry but we've also got the drop

us lower the links a little bit here at

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:27.020 
us lower the links a little bit here at
the<00:02:25.049> bottom<00:02:25.409> because<00:02:26.069> this<00:02:26.519> truck<00:02:26.790> has<00:02:27.000> a

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:28.500 
little bit of a suspension lift so

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:30.050 
little bit of a suspension lift so
instead<00:02:28.769> of<00:02:28.830> the<00:02:29.010> class<00:02:29.250> one<00:02:29.549> where<00:02:29.760> we<00:02:29.879> want

instead of the class one where we want

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:32.210 
instead of the class one where we want

keep the suspension low on the class two

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:35.930 
keep the suspension low on the class two
we're<00:02:34.709> actually<00:02:34.920> giving<00:02:35.400> it<00:02:35.489> a<00:02:35.549> suspension

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:35.940 
we're actually giving it a suspension

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:38.210 
we're actually giving it a suspension
lift<00:02:36.330> and<00:02:36.540> in<00:02:36.930> order<00:02:37.170> to<00:02:37.200> keep<00:02:37.440> the<00:02:37.620> geometry

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:38.220 
lift and in order to keep the geometry

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:40.280 
lift and in order to keep the geometry
nice<00:02:38.400> as<00:02:38.670> you<00:02:39.269> can<00:02:39.390> see<00:02:39.540> it's<00:02:39.690> the<00:02:39.870> links<00:02:40.200> are

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:40.290 
nice as you can see it's the links are

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:43.819 
nice as you can see it's the links are
almost<00:02:40.530> flat<00:02:41.209> we've<00:02:42.209> actually<00:02:42.450> used<00:02:42.690> the<00:02:43.079> GCM

00:02:43.819 --> 00:02:43.829 
almost flat we've actually used the GCM

almost flat we've actually used the GCM
drop<00:02:44.069> skid<00:02:44.310> here<00:02:44.579> and<00:02:44.730> that<00:02:45.390> also<00:02:45.569> gives<00:02:45.959> us<00:02:46.200> a

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:46.290 
drop skid here and that also gives us a

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:48.350 
drop skid here and that also gives us a
little<00:02:46.440> extra<00:02:46.860> room<00:02:47.040> for<00:02:47.849> this<00:02:48.000> taller

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:48.360 
little extra room for this taller

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:50.360 
little extra room for this taller
high-low<00:02:49.019> transfer<00:02:49.470> case<00:02:49.650> it's<00:02:49.950> quite<00:02:50.129> a<00:02:50.160> bit

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:50.370 
high-low transfer case it's quite a bit

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:52.160 
high-low transfer case it's quite a bit
taller<00:02:50.519> than<00:02:50.819> our<00:02:50.849> one-to-one<00:02:51.450> transfer<00:02:51.989> case

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:52.170 
taller than our one-to-one transfer case

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:54.650 
taller than our one-to-one transfer case
but<00:02:53.069> still<00:02:53.190> obviously<00:02:53.700> a<00:02:53.819> little<00:02:54.120> quite<00:02:54.480> a<00:02:54.510> bit

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:54.660 
but still obviously a little quite a bit

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:57.110 
but still obviously a little quite a bit
lower<00:02:54.810> than<00:02:54.930> the<00:02:55.400> than<00:02:56.400> the<00:02:56.430> floor<00:02:56.849> and<00:02:57.060> the

rear here that you can see where the

00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:00.720 
frame rail would have extended too so

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:02.479 
frame rail would have extended too so
with<00:03:01.109> the<00:03:01.230> drop<00:03:01.470> skid<00:03:01.769> and<00:03:01.920> then<00:03:02.040> the<00:03:02.160> high-low

00:03:02.479 --> 00:03:02.489 
with the drop skid and then the high-low

00:03:02.489 --> 00:03:03.949 
with the drop skid and then the high-low
we've<00:03:02.730> still<00:03:02.940> got<00:03:03.090> room<00:03:03.239> for<00:03:03.299> the<00:03:03.540> interior

00:03:03.949 --> 00:03:03.959 
we've still got room for the interior

00:03:03.959 --> 00:03:05.360 
we've still got room for the interior
and<00:03:04.200> we're<00:03:04.470> going<00:03:04.590> to<00:03:04.650> be<00:03:04.709> using<00:03:04.890> another<00:03:05.069> one

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:05.370 
and we're going to be using another one

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:08.270 
and we're going to be using another one
of<00:03:05.459> these<00:03:05.549> Jeep<00:03:06.359> bodies<00:03:06.750> here<00:03:06.930> that's<00:03:07.280> gonna

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:08.280 
of these Jeep bodies here that's gonna

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:11.300 
of these Jeep bodies here that's gonna
be<00:03:08.459> dropped<00:03:08.760> onto<00:03:08.970> this<00:03:09.239> skeleton<00:03:09.959> j2<00:03:10.200> now<00:03:10.980> I

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:11.310 
be dropped onto this skeleton j2 now I

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:12.559 
be dropped onto this skeleton j2 now I
don't<00:03:11.640> think<00:03:11.819> I<00:03:11.910> talked<00:03:12.180> about<00:03:12.269> this<00:03:12.510> before

00:03:12.559 --> 00:03:12.569 
don't think I talked about this before

00:03:12.569 --> 00:03:14.360 
don't think I talked about this before
but<00:03:12.989> I<00:03:13.260> wanted<00:03:13.650> to<00:03:13.709> talk<00:03:13.920> a<00:03:13.950> little<00:03:14.129> bit<00:03:14.280> more

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:14.370 
but I wanted to talk a little bit more

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:17.000 
but I wanted to talk a little bit more
about<00:03:14.910> the<00:03:15.120> dual<00:03:15.810> servo<00:03:16.410> mount<00:03:16.680> and<00:03:16.829> there's<00:03:16.950> a

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:17.010 
about the dual servo mount and there's a

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:19.759 
about the dual servo mount and there's a
reason<00:03:17.310> because<00:03:17.579> when<00:03:18.420> we<00:03:18.599> did<00:03:18.840> our<00:03:18.870> K<00:03:19.379> 44

00:03:19.759 --> 00:03:19.769 
reason because when we did our K 44

00:03:19.769 --> 00:03:22.039 
reason because when we did our K 44

bracket here that you can see mounted on
the<00:03:45.870> axle<00:03:46.260> this<00:03:46.799> bracket<00:03:47.400> is<00:03:47.630> a<00:03:48.630> driver's<00:03:49.169> side

00:03:49.339 --> 00:03:49.349 
the axle this bracket is a driver's side

00:03:49.349 --> 00:03:52.670 
the axle this bracket is a driver's side
a<00:03:49.620> left<00:03:49.950> side<00:03:50.190> drop<00:03:50.549> for<00:03:51.419> the<00:03:51.510> panhard<00:03:51.930> so

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:52.680 
a left side drop for the panhard so

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:56.089 
a left side drop for the panhard so
that's<00:03:53.130> different<00:03:53.489> than<00:03:53.669> our<00:03:53.790> class<00:03:54.120> 2<00:03:55.099> sorry

00:03:56.089 --> 00:03:56.099 
that's different than our class 2 sorry

00:03:56.099 --> 00:03:57.440 
that's different than our class 2 sorry
for<00:03:56.310> the<00:03:56.400> sloppy<00:03:56.609> steering<00:03:57.060> there<00:03:57.180> I<00:03:57.209> left

00:03:57.440 --> 00:03:57.450 
for the sloppy steering there I left

00:03:57.450 --> 00:04:00.650 
for the sloppy steering there I left
that<00:03:57.599> off<00:03:57.780> so<00:03:57.930> I<00:03:57.959> can<00:03:58.109> show<00:03:58.260> you<00:03:59.209> you'll<00:04:00.209> see<00:04:00.450> on

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:00.660 
that off so I can show you you'll see on

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:02.770 
that off so I can show you you'll see on
this<00:04:00.959> class<00:04:01.410> to<00:04:01.650> rig<00:04:01.919> that<00:04:01.950> we're<00:04:02.280> doing<00:04:02.370> now

00:04:02.770 --> 00:04:02.780 
this class to rig that we're doing now

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:06.339 
this class to rig that we're doing now
the<00:04:03.780> panhard<00:04:04.590> is<00:04:04.950> actually<00:04:05.489> on<00:04:05.700> the

00:04:06.339 --> 00:04:06.349 
the panhard is actually on the

00:04:06.349 --> 00:04:10.159 
the panhard is actually on the
right-hand<00:04:07.349> side<00:04:07.440> of<00:04:07.709> the<00:04:07.769> truck<00:04:08.389> so<00:04:09.389> the

00:04:10.159 --> 00:04:10.169 
right-hand side of the truck so the

00:04:10.169 --> 00:04:12.259 
right-hand side of the truck so the
panhard<00:04:10.560> route<00:04:10.829> is<00:04:11.250> not<00:04:11.459> on<00:04:11.609> the<00:04:11.669> left<00:04:11.910> like<00:04:12.150> it

00:04:12.259 --> 00:04:12.269 
panhard route is not on the left like it

00:04:12.269 --> 00:04:14.360 
panhard route is not on the left like it
is<00:04:12.359> on<00:04:12.480> the<00:04:12.569> K<00:04:12.720> 44<00:04:13.049> truck<00:04:13.530> it's<00:04:13.949> now<00:04:14.160> on<00:04:14.340> the

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:14.370 
is on the K 44 truck it's now on the

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:16.339 
is on the K 44 truck it's now on the
right<00:04:14.609> and<00:04:14.819> the<00:04:15.150> reason<00:04:15.449> why<00:04:15.569> this<00:04:15.629> is<00:04:15.930> so<00:04:16.109> cool

00:04:16.339 --> 00:04:16.349 
right and the reason why this is so cool

00:04:16.349 --> 00:04:18.529 
right and the reason why this is so cool
is<00:04:16.620> because<00:04:16.949> this<00:04:17.760> suspension<00:04:18.120> mount<00:04:18.419> this

00:04:18.529 --> 00:04:18.539 
is because this suspension mount this

00:04:18.539 --> 00:04:20.569 
is because this suspension mount this
servo<00:04:19.229> mount<00:04:19.500> is<00:04:19.620> so<00:04:19.739> cool<00:04:20.010> is<00:04:20.130> because<00:04:20.280> it's

00:04:20.569 --> 00:04:20.579 
servo mount is so cool is because it's

00:04:20.579 --> 00:04:23.150 
servo mount is so cool is because it's
reversible<00:04:21.090> I<00:04:21.359> had<00:04:21.900> a<00:04:21.930> question<00:04:22.169> asked<00:04:22.830> the

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:23.160 
reversible I had a question asked the

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:24.740 
reversible I had a question asked the
other<00:04:23.310> day<00:04:23.550> by<00:04:24.000> a<00:04:24.030> couple<00:04:24.390> different<00:04:24.659> people

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:24.750 
other day by a couple different people

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:28.940 
other day by a couple different people
so<00:04:25.310> what<00:04:26.310> happens<00:04:26.760> if<00:04:26.909> I<00:04:27.060> want<00:04:27.270> to<00:04:27.450> do<00:04:27.599> a<00:04:27.900> driver

00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:28.950 
so what happens if I want to do a driver

00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:31.730 
so what happens if I want to do a driver
side<00:04:29.160> drop<00:04:29.750> passenger<00:04:30.750> side<00:04:30.960> drop<00:04:31.290> on<00:04:31.590> the

00:04:31.730 --> 00:04:31.740 
side drop passenger side drop on the

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:33.860 
side drop passenger side drop on the
axle<00:04:32.160> or<00:04:32.370> I<00:04:32.790> want<00:04:33.060> to<00:04:33.150> do<00:04:33.270> a<00:04:33.300> different<00:04:33.630> setup

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:33.870 
axle or I want to do a different setup

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:35.660 
axle or I want to do a different setup
is<00:04:34.170> there<00:04:34.590> any<00:04:34.710> way<00:04:34.830> for<00:04:34.860> me<00:04:35.130> to<00:04:35.250> move<00:04:35.430> the

00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:35.670 
is there any way for me to move the

00:04:35.670 --> 00:04:38.090 
is there any way for me to move the
motor<00:04:35.940> mount<00:04:36.270> over<00:04:37.230> to<00:04:37.350> the<00:04:37.470> other<00:04:37.590> side<00:04:37.830> well

00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:38.100 
motor mount over to the other side well

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:39.320 
motor mount over to the other side well
of<00:04:38.220> course<00:04:38.250> there<00:04:38.550> is<00:04:38.640> because<00:04:38.820> the<00:04:39.150> motor

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:39.330 
of course there is because the motor

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:41.210 
of course there is because the motor
mount<00:04:39.600> sits<00:04:39.960> inside<00:04:40.200> the<00:04:40.410> two<00:04:40.680> sides<00:04:41.010> of<00:04:41.130> the

00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:41.220 
mount sits inside the two sides of the

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:44.060 
mount sits inside the two sides of the
frame<00:04:41.430> here<00:04:41.730> and<00:04:41.910> so<00:04:42.900> the<00:04:43.380> motor<00:04:43.590> mount<00:04:43.860> can<00:04:44.040> be

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:44.070 
frame here and so the motor mount can be

00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:45.440 
frame here and so the motor mount can be
switched<00:04:44.400> from<00:04:44.610> left<00:04:44.820> to<00:04:44.910> right<00:04:45.120> doesn't

00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:45.450 
switched from left to right doesn't

00:04:45.450 --> 00:04:46.430 
switched from left to right doesn't
really<00:04:45.570> matter<00:04:45.780> you<00:04:45.870> just<00:04:45.960> turn<00:04:46.260> it<00:04:46.290> around

00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:46.440 
really matter you just turn it around

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:49.580 
really matter you just turn it around
and<00:04:46.920> the<00:04:47.520> axial<00:04:47.970> transmission<00:04:48.720> allows<00:04:49.170> you<00:04:49.380> to

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:49.590 
and the axial transmission allows you to

00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:51.860 
and the axial transmission allows you to
adjust<00:04:49.740> the<00:04:50.130> input<00:04:50.730> shaft<00:04:51.120> from<00:04:51.420> the<00:04:51.480> front<00:04:51.780> of

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:51.870 
adjust the input shaft from the front of

00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:53.180 
adjust the input shaft from the front of
the<00:04:51.930> tranny<00:04:52.170> to<00:04:52.350> the<00:04:52.470> back<00:04:52.650> and<00:04:52.830> then<00:04:52.920> you<00:04:52.980> can

00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:53.190 
the tranny to the back and then you can

00:04:53.190 --> 00:04:54.680 
the tranny to the back and then you can
switch<00:04:53.490> it<00:04:53.520> all<00:04:53.700> around<00:04:53.730> so<00:04:54.120> this<00:04:54.270> could<00:04:54.510> this

00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:54.690 
switch it all around so this could this

00:04:54.690 --> 00:04:57.260 
switch it all around so this could this
is<00:04:54.840> a<00:04:54.870> completely<00:04:55.380> reversible<00:04:56.010> system<00:04:56.280> both

00:04:57.260 --> 00:04:57.270 
is a completely reversible system both

00:04:57.270 --> 00:05:00.320 
is a completely reversible system both
rails<00:04:57.630> are<00:04:58.020> symmetrical<00:04:58.710> and<00:04:59.060> the<00:05:00.060> mount

00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:00.330 
rails are symmetrical and the mount

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:06.020 
rails are symmetrical and the mount
works<00:05:01.140> on<00:05:01.350> either<00:05:01.590> rail<00:05:02.510> the<00:05:03.510> servo<00:05:03.810> mount<00:05:05.030> can

00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:06.030 
works on either rail the servo mount can

00:05:06.030 --> 00:05:10.130 
works on either rail the servo mount can
be<00:05:06.270> a<00:05:06.690> left<00:05:07.140> side<00:05:07.410> kick<00:05:07.800> or<00:05:08.930> switched<00:05:09.930> around

00:05:10.130 --> 00:05:10.140 
be a left side kick or switched around

00:05:10.140 --> 00:05:12.410 
be a left side kick or switched around
to<00:05:10.530> be<00:05:10.650> a<00:05:10.680> right<00:05:10.980> side<00:05:11.280> kick<00:05:11.580> and<00:05:11.760> you<00:05:12.270> can

00:05:12.410 --> 00:05:12.420 
to be a right side kick and you can

00:05:12.420 --> 00:05:14.510 
to be a right side kick and you can
still<00:05:12.660> get<00:05:13.140> the<00:05:13.290> dual<00:05:13.470> mount<00:05:13.710> accessory<00:05:14.370> on

00:05:14.510 --> 00:05:14.520 
still get the dual mount accessory on

00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:16.670 
still get the dual mount accessory on
the<00:05:14.640> front<00:05:14.880> here<00:05:15.120> you<00:05:15.960> see<00:05:16.170> the<00:05:16.320> dual<00:05:16.470> mount

00:05:16.670 --> 00:05:16.680 
the front here you see the dual mount

00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:18.350 
the front here you see the dual mount
right<00:05:16.920> up<00:05:17.070> front<00:05:17.310> here<00:05:17.400> that's<00:05:18.150> actually

00:05:18.350 --> 00:05:18.360 
right up front here that's actually

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:22.790 
right up front here that's actually
bolted<00:05:18.810> on<00:05:18.960> of<00:05:19.170> course<00:05:19.310> right<00:05:20.340> so<00:05:21.320> this<00:05:22.320> second

00:05:22.790 --> 00:05:22.800 
bolted on of course right so this second

00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:24.320 
bolted on of course right so this second
servo<00:05:23.010> mount<00:05:23.340> here<00:05:23.550> is<00:05:23.700> actually<00:05:24.060> just<00:05:24.180> a

00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:24.330 
servo mount here is actually just a

00:05:24.330 --> 00:05:25.850 
servo mount here is actually just a
bracket<00:05:24.690> bolted<00:05:24.990> onto<00:05:25.110> the<00:05:25.290> bottom<00:05:25.560> servo

00:05:25.850 --> 00:05:25.860 
bracket bolted onto the bottom servo

00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:26.960 
bracket bolted onto the bottom servo
mount<00:05:26.100> so<00:05:26.280> this<00:05:26.430> whole<00:05:26.610> thing<00:05:26.640> is

00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:26.970 
mount so this whole thing is

00:05:26.970 --> 00:05:28.700 
mount so this whole thing is
interchangeable<00:05:27.510> and<00:05:27.690> reversible<00:05:28.230> and<00:05:28.440> if

00:05:28.700 --> 00:05:28.710 
interchangeable and reversible and if

00:05:28.710 --> 00:05:30.080 
interchangeable and reversible and if
you<00:05:28.800> did<00:05:28.980> happen<00:05:29.310> to<00:05:29.370> have<00:05:29.520> room<00:05:29.760> underneath

00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:30.090 
you did happen to have room underneath

00:05:30.090 --> 00:05:32.300 
you did happen to have room underneath
here<00:05:30.900> in<00:05:31.050> the<00:05:31.140> front<00:05:31.410> you<00:05:31.590> could<00:05:32.130> actually

00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:32.310 
here in the front you could actually

00:05:32.310 --> 00:05:34.010 
here in the front you could actually
take<00:05:32.730> the<00:05:32.910> second<00:05:33.300> servo<00:05:33.510> mount<00:05:33.840> in<00:05:33.930> the

SC x width offset Pig in the front and
this<00:06:04.350> setup<00:06:04.650> is<00:06:04.920> going<00:06:05.070> to<00:06:05.130> allow<00:06:05.370> us<00:06:05.520> to<00:06:05.550> use

00:06:05.720 --> 00:06:05.730 
this setup is going to allow us to use

00:06:05.730 --> 00:06:09.740 
this setup is going to allow us to use
our<00:06:06.600> standard<00:06:07.290> SC<00:06:07.770> x<00:06:07.920> width<00:06:08.630> specifically<00:06:09.630> in

our standard SC x width specifically in

00:06:09.750 --> 00:06:11.840 
our standard SC x width specifically in
the<00:06:09.840> back<00:06:10.020> because<00:06:10.980> it's<00:06:11.160> centered<00:06:11.460> so<00:06:11.670> that's

00:06:11.840 --> 00:06:11.850 
the back because it's centered so that's

00:06:11.850 --> 00:06:14.210 
the back because it's centered so that's
an<00:06:11.970> easy<00:06:12.090> drop-in<00:06:12.660> and<00:06:12.840> in<00:06:13.770> the<00:06:13.860> front<00:06:14.070> we're

00:06:14.210 --> 00:06:14.220 
an easy drop-in and in the front we're

00:06:14.220 --> 00:06:16.250 
an easy drop-in and in the front we're
gonna<00:06:14.310> add<00:06:14.520> our<00:06:14.700> own<00:06:14.730> long<00:06:15.450> and<00:06:15.660> short<00:06:15.870> axles

00:06:16.250 --> 00:06:16.260 
gonna add our own long and short axles

00:06:16.260 --> 00:06:18.170 
gonna add our own long and short axles
here<00:06:16.440> with<00:06:16.680> the<00:06:16.830> standard<00:06:17.250> STX<00:06:17.640> drivetrain

00:06:18.170 --> 00:06:18.180 
here with the standard STX drivetrain

00:06:18.180 --> 00:06:21.200 
here with the standard STX drivetrain
parts<00:06:18.480> and<00:06:18.680> we<00:06:19.680> needed<00:06:20.100> to<00:06:20.760> get<00:06:20.880> the<00:06:21.000> pan

00:06:21.200 --> 00:06:21.210 
parts and we needed to get the pan

00:06:21.210 --> 00:06:24.290 
parts and we needed to get the pan
higher<00:06:21.480> down<00:06:21.720> to<00:06:21.990> the<00:06:22.170> passenger<00:06:22.800> side<00:06:23.300> which

00:06:24.290 --> 00:06:24.300 
higher down to the passenger side which

00:06:24.300 --> 00:06:26.090 
higher down to the passenger side which
means<00:06:24.480> we<00:06:24.720> need<00:06:24.840> the<00:06:25.020> servo<00:06:25.410> driving<00:06:25.860> from<00:06:26.040> the

00:06:26.090 --> 00:06:26.100 
means we need the servo driving from the

00:06:26.100 --> 00:06:28.250 
means we need the servo driving from the
driver's<00:06:26.550> side<00:06:26.580> to<00:06:26.760> go<00:06:27.060> to<00:06:27.120> meet<00:06:27.630> to<00:06:27.900> match<00:06:28.050> up

00:06:28.250 --> 00:06:28.260 
driver's side to go to meet to match up

00:06:28.260 --> 00:06:29.870 
driver's side to go to meet to match up
with<00:06:28.380> the<00:06:28.470> panhard<00:06:28.830> so<00:06:29.070> I<00:06:29.100> don't<00:06:29.430> didn't<00:06:29.730> think

00:06:29.870 --> 00:06:29.880 
with the panhard so I don't didn't think

00:06:29.880 --> 00:06:31.670 
with the panhard so I don't didn't think
I've<00:06:29.970> really<00:06:30.180> talked<00:06:30.390> about<00:06:30.510> that<00:06:30.690> suspension

00:06:31.670 --> 00:06:31.680 
I've really talked about that suspension

00:06:31.680 --> 00:06:34.370 
I've really talked about that suspension
setup<00:06:32.010> and<00:06:32.300> servo<00:06:33.300> mount<00:06:33.600> setup<00:06:33.960> in<00:06:34.080> the<00:06:34.170> last

00:06:34.370 --> 00:06:34.380

00:06:34.380 --> 00:06:36.020 
setup and servo mount setup in the last
video<00:06:34.680> so<00:06:34.740> I<00:06:35.130> just<00:06:35.370> want<00:06:35.520> to<00:06:35.610> show<00:06:35.760> you<00:06:35.820> an
