00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:31.230 
competitive nature of the sport when you

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:33.320 
competitive nature of the sport when you
dive<00:00:31.410> in<00:00:31.560> a<00:00:31.619> pool<00:00:31.830> it's<00:00:32.099> just<00:00:32.730> you<00:00:33.090> and<00:00:33.120> the

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:33.330 
dive in a pool it's just you and the

00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:35.150 
dive in a pool it's just you and the
clock<00:00:33.540> and<00:00:33.570> the<00:00:33.870> pool<00:00:34.080> and<00:00:34.350> each<00:00:34.710> lane<00:00:34.949> is<00:00:35.040> the

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:35.160 
clock and the pool and each lane is the

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:37.490 
clock and the pool and each lane is the
same<00:00:35.400> you<00:00:35.940> don't<00:00:36.090> depend<00:00:36.390> on<00:00:36.570> luck<00:00:36.720> you<00:00:37.260> only

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:37.500 
same you don't depend on luck you only

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:39.740 
same you don't depend on luck you only
depend<00:00:37.769> on<00:00:37.830> yourself<00:00:37.940> each<00:00:38.940> person's<00:00:39.390> on<00:00:39.570> his

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750 
depend on yourself each person's on his

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:41.900 
depend on yourself each person's on his
own<00:00:39.930> and<00:00:40.199> I<00:00:40.949> think<00:00:41.190> that's<00:00:41.370> why<00:00:41.550> I<00:00:41.580> was

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:41.910 
own and I think that's why I was

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:43.910 
own and I think that's why I was
initially<00:00:42.120> drawn<00:00:42.449> to<00:00:42.629> swimming<00:00:42.989> I<00:00:43.199> guess<00:00:43.650> now

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920 
initially drawn to swimming I guess now

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:45.229 
initially drawn to swimming I guess now
that<00:00:43.949> I<00:00:44.280> look<00:00:44.460> back<00:00:44.640> at<00:00:44.910> it

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 
that I look back at it

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:47.090 
that I look back at it
what<00:00:45.750> I<00:00:45.780> liked<00:00:46.050> and<00:00:46.079> what<00:00:46.350> made<00:00:46.590> me<00:00:46.710> stuck<00:00:46.950> with

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
what I liked and what made me stuck with

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:49.610 
what I liked and what made me stuck with
swimming<00:00:47.309> is<00:00:47.630> you<00:00:48.630> know<00:00:48.750> that<00:00:48.960> field<00:00:49.260> that<00:00:49.380> you

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350 
get each time you dive in a pool it's

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:53.360 
get each time you dive in a pool it's
hard<00:00:52.590> to<00:00:52.649> describe<00:00:52.890> but<00:00:53.100> you<00:00:53.190> feel<00:00:53.309> like
