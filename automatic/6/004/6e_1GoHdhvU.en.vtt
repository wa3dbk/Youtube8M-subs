and you hover over that bounty that you

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:52.249 
and you hover over that bounty that you
think<00:01:51.090> you<00:01:51.149> complete<00:01:51.479> it<00:01:51.509> and<00:01:51.689> it<00:01:51.840> also<00:01:51.990> have<00:01:52.229> a

00:01:52.249 --> 00:01:52.259 
think you complete it and it also have a

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:53.989 
think you complete it and it also have a

little yellow corner with a star on it

00:01:53.999 --> 00:01:55.550 
little yellow corner with a star on it
so<00:01:54.210> that<00:01:54.329> means<00:01:54.450> it's<00:01:54.659> completed<00:01:55.020> another

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:20.550 
that good stuff as well so this is also

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:22.910 
that good stuff as well so this is also
really<00:02:21.000> easy<00:02:21.030> way<00:02:21.540> to<00:02:21.600> level<00:02:22.020> up<00:02:22.230> so<00:02:22.710> it's

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:22.920 
really easy way to level up so it's

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:24.290 
really easy way to level up so it's
probably<00:02:23.130> bit<00:02:23.280> easier<00:02:23.610> than<00:02:23.760> brownies<00:02:24.000> but

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:24.300 
probably bit easier than brownies but

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:26.240 
probably bit easier than brownies but
bounties<00:02:24.780> you<00:02:24.900> do<00:02:25.020> get<00:02:25.200> a<00:02:25.230> lot<00:02:25.380> more<00:02:25.440> XP<00:02:26.010> so

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:26.250 
bounties you do get a lot more XP so

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:27.500 
bounties you do get a lot more XP so
it's<00:02:26.400> a<00:02:26.459> lot<00:02:26.610> but<00:02:26.819> if<00:02:26.970> you<00:02:27.060> do<00:02:27.239> brownies

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:27.510 
it's a lot but if you do brownies

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:29.360 
it's a lot but if you do brownies
brownies<00:02:27.780> are<00:02:28.260> bit<00:02:28.470> harder<00:02:28.770> than<00:02:28.800> doing<00:02:29.220> it

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:29.370 
brownies are bit harder than doing it

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:30.770 
brownies are bit harder than doing it
patrols<00:02:29.790> on<00:02:29.970> the<00:02:30.030> clothes<00:02:30.209> were<00:02:30.360> drawing<00:02:30.569> but

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:32.730 
either way they're both fun so that's

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:34.309 
either way they're both fun so that's
really<00:02:32.880> it<00:02:33.030> today<00:02:33.390> is<00:02:33.540> how<00:02:33.660> to<00:02:33.720> level<00:02:33.959> up<00:02:34.050> fast
