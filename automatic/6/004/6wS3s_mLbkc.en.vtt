00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:07.589
 hello girls today I share this idea for 

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:11.010
 organize earrings use a lid 

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:12.990
 shoe boxes and put some 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:15.600
 horizontal cardboard bars at 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:17.760
 which I added the same cartons 

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:20.220
 with which the earrings come or if not 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:21.990
 you can put the earrings directly 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:24.029
 missair this are clip-pons style of 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:26.039
 those that are pressure but they 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:28.380
 I share does not care because I know 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:31.169
 this lends itself to organize all kinds 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:33.329
 of lenses you just have to open the 

00:00:31.169 --> 00:00:35.750
 holes to the cartoncitos for your 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:35.750
 earrings 

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:43.870
 for a bigger stage I recommend you 

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:46.630
 that you hit another bar in the center 

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:48.910
 cardboard to serve as a support to 

00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:52.720
 the other horizontal bars that will 

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:55.600
 be placing in this way 

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:58.180
 you stick it in the center and you're going to put it 

00:00:55.600 --> 00:01:00.400
 at the height of the edge of the lid 

00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:03.520
 then the others you hit in the 

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:06.940
 center and towards the ends with rubber 

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:10.680
 silicone and place them at height or in 

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:10.680
 Separate distances that you like 

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:16.420
 as mine is smaller it does not need 

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:18.880
 add any bar in the center 

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:21.340
 I just paint it white and I know this 

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:23.500
 paint it and the truth is the finish 

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:26.850
 he liked it very much because it seemed as if 

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:26.850
 outside a wooden box 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:35.220
 after painting or lining the lid 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:37.680
 lining the cardboard bars 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:41.510
 I made three each one measures the width of 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:41.510
 the lid by two and a half centimeters 

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:47.909
 and I put them at a distance of 7 

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:50.249
 centimeters each 

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:52.969
 I made this video taking into account the 

00:01:50.249 --> 00:01:55.319
 requests I had about 

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:56.420
 organizers for networks that will stick 

00:01:55.319 --> 00:01:59.219
 on the wall 

00:01:56.420 --> 00:02:01.530
 I did not stick it on the wall but I did not 

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:03.119
 I recommend that you leave it as I have it 

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:05.909
 because it does not have the necessary stability 

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:07.560
 to leave it more stop however the 

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:09.810
 paradito style so I like it because it's 

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:13.940
 as a boutique style but good all 

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:13.940
 in a matter of taste of each 

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:39.090
 and well this is all as they see super 

00:02:36.599 --> 00:02:41.310
 fast too practical I think 

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:43.580
 I hope that the idea works for you 

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:43.580

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:48.430
