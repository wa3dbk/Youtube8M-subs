00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.200
 Hello UTB crazy how much I love Arthur 

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:08.420
 your internet is just a super car 

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:12.799
 Telyakovsky 

00:00:08.420 --> 00:00:17.550
 the internet that I have via modem 

00:00:12.799 --> 00:00:21.270
 Callisto 821 + modem and the ancient 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:24.990
 probably we don’t know about seven years 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:27.859
 but not exactly the joke is that yesterday 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:31.019
 I played so well all day in the tank 

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:33.660
 I played at night and here is the morning morning 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:35.760
 we were going to finish everything with 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:39.239
 not pink route grew up in battle so here 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:42.210
 suddenly and something lagged start and music 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:44.789
 miracle stopped playing from contact me 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:47.969
 so I want something I did not understand well ka and when I played 

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:51.690
 fight and now on merged because of this all 

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:53.579
 And such an opa and the Internet does not collapse then 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:56.789
 is kind of like that it is switched on skype 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:57.420
 works in timspike I can hear but with 

00:00:56.789 --> 00:00:59.730
 lags 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:02.520
 that is, well, just the speed of the chambers to 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:04.799
 minimum and all modem disabled enabled 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:08.790
 like fixed stop it up again 

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:10.619
 Well, in short, today I am all 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:13.110
 spent the day without the Internet therefore 

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:17.820
 uploaded the video that I made back at 5 am 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:20.070
 that is, it's 2 nights and i'm five in the morning 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:24.960
 More video was ready to fill but could not 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:27.810
 pour how cool yes this this this 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:30.960
 feeling when you sit from the internet is 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:35.009
 just divinely even telly looked 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:38.100
 a little bit and now i have already done there 

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:41.130
 a bunch of applications there sharpened their type to do 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:44.670
 it is her brother that they are not his 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:47.759
 type said they would do tomorrow there before 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:49.649
 15 hours I think look now I 'll start 

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:52.290
 I will try to go suddenly including a computer 

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:55.380
 working as if nothing had happened that is, 

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:58.990
 how did they lead you why why you 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:02:02.350
 will know that is generally super 

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:03.939
 because they didn’t say we were 

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:06.970
 reviewed your application 

00:02:03.939 --> 00:02:08.020
 and for some reason you have indicated that the Internet 

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:09.729
 disabled for non-payment 

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:12.580
 how is it for nonpayment disabled if 

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:15.370
 just a couple of days ago totally hit 

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:16.989
 debt but we don't know we see 

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:20.620
 that you have repaid the debt but 

00:02:16.989 --> 00:02:23.130
 for some reason, our from the router is shorter well, they 

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:29.010
 so maybe we carried it this hard 

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:29.010
 i'm shorter just just get high really 

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:37.030
 by the way here who knows in general who vkurse 

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:39.880
 just told me the site that there is 

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:42.370
 some companies that are engaged here 

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:44.980
 purely conducts the Internet through some 

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:46.690
 is there an optical cable yes there or something like that 

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:49.299
 that but it certainly costs money there 

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:50.890
 2000 hryvnia can one and a half I'm ready 

00:02:49.299 --> 00:02:55.030
 pay i just really don't know either 

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:56.830
 One company here is a pancake that can 

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:58.630
 hold me after private sectors 

00:02:56.830 --> 00:03:01.030
 that is, here only here tamed who 

00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:02.730
 via modem via telephone line and all 

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:05.680
 another internet and there is no 

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:07.780
 if I could get in touch 

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:10.690
 with someone who is doing this or finding 

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:14.019
 at least some name well I can 

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:17.730
 google but something not really nothing 

00:03:14.019 --> 00:03:22.480
 found in the general Internet about this 

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:26.920
 will be shorter if anyone knows write in 

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:28.780
 the comments here if i find some 

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:31.630
 such a firm, I would love to 

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:33.940
 invested somewhere I ’m getting some money but 

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:37.030
 if there was a normal internet I could 

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:40.239
 shipping video more often but really it 

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:43.510
 that my video download takes a couple 

00:03:40.239 --> 00:03:45.819
 ie hours and leads to the IPCC weighs 

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:50.910
 no gock pour it should be well two hours it 

00:03:45.819 --> 00:03:50.910
 at least so that such sadness 

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:59.250
 in principle, what is there to look at prices 

00:03:56.540 --> 00:04:01.670
 online stores and a little bit 

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:04.440
 as now all iron prices have risen 

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:07.500
 if more processors are there more or less 

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:09.660
 it's limits there plus minus something 

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:15.109
 the graphics card I just ohrenel my vidyaha 

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:20.250
 which I bought at the end of spring for 6,800 

00:04:15.109 --> 00:04:24.120
 now 9 800 now and look 

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:26.820
 I'm just now right now I will clarify now 

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:29.580
 just because I ohrenel just like 

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:31.650
 may generally increase in price with that 

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:34.320
 the idea of ​​iron, on the contrary, should become obsolete 

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:37.080
 Well, as if I should be cheaper by the logic, I 

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:43.800
 I understand what to know and then rise in price 

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:49.229
 all that but not as much as m 780 

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:52.290
 We introduce here it is lightning up to 9 833 hryvnia 

00:04:49.229 --> 00:04:54.930
 and where do they themselves come from, that is, in 

00:04:52.290 --> 00:04:56.880
 same photo suite store and took such 

00:04:54.930 --> 00:05:02.180
 now they just have to just 

00:04:56.880 --> 00:05:07.350
 class class put class these prices yes 

00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:11.039
 Okay, who knows the internet campaign 

00:05:07.350 --> 00:05:13.639
 Write in the comments here before I paper 

00:05:11.039 --> 00:05:13.639
 further vidosa
