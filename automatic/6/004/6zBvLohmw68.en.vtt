00:00:04.340 --> 00:00:09.860
 sure all the girls guys this is 

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:12.750
 a video on the Athens sheet and we'll do a 

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:13.830
 bracelet with paper and ribbon 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:17.369
 adhesive 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:19.890
 you simply have to take a tape 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:22.290
 finished sticker of the card of 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:24.450
 newspaper you can choose these kind of 

00:00:22.290 --> 00:00:26.399
 newspaper almost kind of paper me 

00:00:24.450 --> 00:00:29.130
 stylizing the example this is where he has 

00:00:26.399 --> 00:00:31.079
 in that and the end as well you see 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:33.870
 there are already some strips of one 

00:00:31.079 --> 00:00:36.510
 greatness to me with I am also 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:38.220
 approximately 6 mm the colors reduced 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:40.020
 imaginable possible but you can 

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:42.620
 quietly take note 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:46.350
 any type of magazine is cut out 

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:49.860
 after that you will need a couple of 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:53.790
 scissors in order to cut out precisely 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:56.310
 these strips of paper from the con 

00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:58.200
 the vinavil and with which they will glue e 

00:00:56.310 --> 00:01:02.130
 we will eventually protect ours 

00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:09.030
 bracelet and a very simple brush 

00:01:02.130 --> 00:01:11.010
 so let's start right away with the 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:13.640
 put some wine at the villa on a 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:15.570
 piece of paper in order to facilitate 

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:18.990
 the 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:19.590
 the procedure and I would immediately put it in reach 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:22.970
 of hand 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:25.950
 the glue you can use after that 

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:29.160
 I take with my brush is a little bit 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:32.130
 of cola I dip it and I go to pass it to 

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:37.140
 small portions on my carp band 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:39.869
 terminated both from the outside always 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:41.970
 small strokes because we will do this 

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:45.119
 full floor work both in the part 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:47.940
 internal because the objective is to 

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:52.950
 wrap my paper tape with 

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:56.700
 some strips of paper so I have 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:59.310
 chose the orange color and I go to 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:02.220
 insert a first one inside 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:06.000
 end and slowly let us join 

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:11.959
 the whole surface of the right cina.il 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:11.959
 paper on the tape on our visual 

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:19.370
 by slightly crossing each other 

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:19.370
 other 

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:24.810
 just almost imperceptibly 

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:30.440
 one millimeter and continues with others 

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:30.440
 always strip from the inside 

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:36.050
 in this way 

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:44.420
 once finished I go to change 

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:46.760
 color I used a green then 

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:49.430
 I created two orange ends in 

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:52.820
 this way and then another green one 

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:57.920
 it is a single strip of this 

00:02:52.820 --> 00:03:02.960
 beautiful blue color that does a little 

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:05.810
 from break a little these two colors from 

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:09.470
 movement and this is the result 

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:11.600
 finished to give more precision 

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:13.970
 let's go and fix the inner part 

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:16.250
 by cutting a strip of paper from the 

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:19.000
 color we want in this case myself 

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:21.680
 I choose the green of the same size 

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:24.650
 I therefore use the help of a 

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:27.709
 square and draw a first line 

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:32.690
 in the upper part is a second line 

00:03:27.709 --> 00:03:35.750
 in the lower part in this way I have to 

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:38.320
 however check the height of this one 

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:42.380
 band that matches exactly 

00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:47.030
 inside my tape in this 

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:49.640
 way once cut and the 

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:56.030
 strip that I'm going to insert 

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:59.959
 inside I can continue passing the 

00:03:56.030 --> 00:04:06.170
 glue slightly just a lot 

00:03:59.959 --> 00:04:10.370
 slightly diluted in the back of mine 

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:12.709
 band of my green stripe applied 

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:17.590
 the glue also in the inner part of the 

00:04:12.709 --> 00:04:20.950
 my tape wrap like this 

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:25.940
 I insert and pay close attention 

00:04:20.950 --> 00:04:27.590
 I'm going to spread this strip of 

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:29.720
 paper 

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:33.169
 flattening as much as possible to 

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:37.280
 avoid creating bubbles in 

00:04:33.169 --> 00:04:41.000
 this way as you well see here 

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:44.360
 a small part is missing then cropping 

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:47.090
 a little piece of my strips 

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:50.210
 the green paste this quietly 

00:04:47.090 --> 00:04:52.070
 finished result we now have to instead 

00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:55.610
 protect it we can do it through 

00:04:52.070 --> 00:04:59.720
 a solution that is used for 

00:04:55.610 --> 00:05:03.560
 protective dÃ©coupage or simply 

00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:07.190
 a vinavil given nor a series of past 

00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:09.530
 at least two or three passes from the walnut 

00:05:07.190 --> 00:05:12.320
 nature and the other is the bracelet 

00:05:09.530 --> 00:05:16.630
 is practically finished I leave you at 

00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:16.630
 photo a kiss and the next hello
