00:00:02.150 --> 00:00:09.809
 well let's repair 

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:12.640
 This hair clipper is very a 

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:16.150
 very very used model 

00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:19.060
 with different brands are or not 

00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:23.500
 apparently does not have any brand and 

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:26.170
 we are going to replace the rechargeable battery 

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:29.070
 although I do not have unarmed 

00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:29.070
 it can be proved 

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:34.510
 ah 

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:43.520
 we can see that here 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:45.610
 It has two screws one here and one here 

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:45.610
 ah 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:50.840
 first we have disassembled this head 

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:59.230
 just pulling 

00:00:54.550 --> 00:01:02.980
 we disassembled unscrew those those two 

00:00:59.230 --> 00:01:06.300
 screws this head comes out 

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:06.300
 then we have another here 

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:11.090
 and what we have to remove is this 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:14.829
 stage 

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:17.730
 to remove this stage this should come out 

00:01:14.829 --> 00:01:20.340
 over here 

00:01:17.730 --> 00:01:26.100
 pulling quite strong because it has 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:29.670
 a few tabs here some clips that yes 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:32.540
 we rotate this we can see that you hear 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:32.540
 a click like a ball 

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:41.570
 ok and by pulling hard here 

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:41.570
 and if we can do it we can see 

00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:53.290
 already this stage comes out perfectly 

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:55.680
 and we can see 

00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:58.680
 the two batteries 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:02:01.220
 that are normal rechargeable batteries that 

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:04.870
 we can buy anywhere 

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:04.870
 the only thing we have to do 

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:08.750
 is to remove these two tabs 

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:15.910
 if we do it with a stranger at finite and 

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:17.580
 pressing hard here we can take it out 

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:21.500
 llosa each 

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:21.500
 let's see if we can see how I get the other 

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:48.349
 He has split a little but good to the 

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:52.090
 welding time we can add a 

00:02:48.349 --> 00:02:52.090
 little bit more tin and that's it 

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:58.000
 memory 

00:02:56.290 --> 00:03:03.080
 and we just have to change this 

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:06.410
 replace it and put it back here 

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:07.660
 remember that you can see here I do not know if it 

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:12.140
 can see 

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:16.960
 that this positive and be negative 

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:16.960
 to then find out where we can put it 

00:03:24.159 --> 00:03:28.450
 and unite them on this other side 

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:33.160
 positive negative and what corresponds 

00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:35.940
 on the other side 

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:38.540
 for nothing this all 

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:38.540
 all right
