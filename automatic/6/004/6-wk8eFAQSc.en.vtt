00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:33.900
 Product introduction but that 

00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:36.200
 The Ne something but one little small 

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:42.180
 I something recently 

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:43.120
 There is a collaboration t-shirt for the UNIQLO game of the red house game 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:45.750

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:50.010
 Call of duty 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:55.940
 This is metal gear but the game 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:01:02.950
 I'm a little addicted to these Pixar collaboration t-shirts recently 

00:00:55.940 --> 00:01:04.550
 It's a bit of a voice to say what goes on and what to say 

00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:09.770
 Surprisingly 

00:01:04.550 --> 00:01:14.450
 It was a guy of this in the black after Metal Gear This Toka But Pixar guy I 

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:17.040
 Surprisingly I design I was in this castle I think kana mark 6 is to become wearing the 

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:18.760
 Because it is good 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:23.170
 A little sentimental 

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:28.400

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:39.590
 But I also used one and a half minutes to introduce products 

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:41.180
 It is product introduction , but seems to be for a limited time if it is this Cat fan ー ー ー ー 's peach is still 

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:43.470
 Ne 

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:49.100
 Well Panta 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:50.730
 I do not drink except personal grapes but I basically do not drink 

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:56.800
 that 

00:01:50.730 --> 00:02:01.760
 It seems like you're not going to burn so many things 

00:01:56.800 --> 00:02:04.010
 I thought that carbonation to protect so much was an adult error I drank 

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:08.140
 Well 

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:09.520
 Because it becomes amazing but I had my once Nanda' 

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:16.350
 I wonder 

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:17.930
 Aftertaste will come clean great I said I'm delicious was'm Yes Well drilled have 

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:19.319
 Hey smell 

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:22.790
 that 

00:02:19.319 --> 00:02:29.680
 By what he is 

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:32.250
 You have things skin-ish new Well I think that I want to drink right away hey 

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:32.250
 town 

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:44.670
 It Well 

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:48.280
 I think this is probably bad 

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:52.000
 It's loose and it tastes a little 

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:56.070
 A little loosely I taste it is something of Ares 

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:56.070
 It's usually delicious but delicious 

00:02:58.190 --> 00:03:01.120
 The color of I mean what in 

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:08.460
 I think that 

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:13.020
 Carbonate in something so much feeling with the things smell 

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:18.390
 Even if I say that I will make things happen 

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:20.780
 Oh also I do not might not good What is this suddenly useless of product introduction one-shot eyes octopus 

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:24.840
 I wonder if it's okay to put out 

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:30.130
 I think a little bit ahead but I think a little bit 

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:33.780
 I'm fine and I say Zubazuba 

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:37.140
 It's delicious like me 

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:38.770
 Tteyuu Na whether that Tteyuu itself was a little badly cooked 

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:44.340
 In any case 

00:03:38.770 --> 00:03:47.780
 I would suffer with it that way easy to wonder if perhaps Toka apple was good 

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:53.150
 I think this is delicious even this 

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:59.200
 I Nde peach aroma of is that good feeling in the cat 

00:03:53.150 --> 00:04:03.319
 It is kind of sweet to say people who like things 

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:07.830
 Not Made up love carbonate and I wonder if another say something female 

00:04:03.319 --> 00:04:11.040
 Or the people who like the feeling that carbonic acid is a little omission of cola is a probably love 

00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:16.019
 I think that's the taste why Nema little eyes 

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:20.130
 It has been a long time, but if it is a product introduction again, it will be about two and a half to three minutes 

00:04:16.019 --> 00:04:24.860
 Oh, I wanted to do it, but first of all, collaboration of cats T-shirts and collaboration of UNIQLO 

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:27.129
 I'm talking about the chart and I'm getting too big 

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:27.129
 Oh dear 

00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:29.710
 I agree 

00:04:30.319 --> 00:04:39.569
 Yes I think it's good again 

00:04:35.129 --> 00:04:43.800
 Next time I usually say it is a little 

00:04:39.569 --> 00:04:44.990
 There is a confectionary snack, so I would like to introduce you in the next place I would like to introduce you 

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:48.860
 I think 

00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:53.180
 Well, it was a fun peach! 

00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:53.600

00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:58.030
