emulsion and emulsion occurs when you've
got<00:01:31.380> to<00:01:31.650> unmix<00:01:32.070> abul<00:01:32.430> things<00:01:32.759> and<00:01:33.750> you<00:01:34.200> have<00:01:34.380> to

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
got to unmix abul things and you have to

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:37.880 
got to unmix abul things and you have to
mix<00:01:34.680> them<00:01:34.950> together<00:01:35.990> so<00:01:36.990> something<00:01:37.439> like<00:01:37.470> that

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
mix them together so something like that

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:39.869 
as you can imagine has to be done slowly

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:42.830 
as you can imagine has to be done slowly
and<00:01:40.290> gently<00:01:40.470> in<00:01:40.829> a<00:01:40.890> sense<00:01:41.189> and<00:01:41.759> it<00:01:42.450> has<00:01:42.600> to<00:01:42.630> be

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
and gently in a sense and it has to be

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:44.929 
and gently in a sense and it has to be
done<00:01:42.990> with<00:01:43.200> care<00:01:43.500> so<00:01:44.189> that<00:01:44.369> the<00:01:44.490> item<00:01:44.759> so

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:44.939 
done with care so that the item so

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:48.980 
done with care so that the item so
separate<00:01:45.479> and<00:01:45.630> break<00:01:47.420> so<00:01:48.420> again<00:01:48.659> I'm<00:01:48.780> just

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990

hitting<00:01:55.890> all<00:01:56.159> one<00:01:56.369> color<00:01:56.610> is<00:01:56.850> what<00:01:57.090> I<00:01:57.119> usually

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.390 
hitting all one color is what I usually

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:00.230 
hitting all one color is what I usually
try<00:01:57.930> to<00:01:58.020> instruct<00:01:58.530> people<00:01:58.710> to<00:01:58.979> do<00:01:59.240> because

kind<00:02:09.450> of<00:02:09.539> a<00:02:09.660> buffer<00:02:09.929> in<00:02:10.379> that<00:02:11.009> sense

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:11.980 
kind of a buffer in that sense

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:16.990 
kind of a buffer in that sense

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:33.410 
ingredients in there so that will cut

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:35.860 
ingredients in there so that will cut
through<00:02:33.680> these<00:02:34.400> very<00:02:34.670> rich<00:02:34.940> flavors<00:02:35.510> of<00:02:35.540> the

going to do this nice and gentle the
clarified<00:02:52.580> butter<00:02:52.760> itself<00:02:53.299> is<00:02:53.600> warm<00:02:53.930> warm<00:02:54.650> to

clarified butter itself is warm warm to

00:02:54.830 --> 00:03:05.259 
clarified butter itself is warm warm to
the<00:02:54.860> touch<00:02:55.060> not<00:02:56.060> hot<00:03:03.730> and<00:03:04.730> as<00:03:04.910> you<00:03:05.090> can<00:03:05.239> see

the touch not hot and as you can see

00:03:05.269 --> 00:03:08.830 
the touch not hot and as you can see
from<00:03:05.630> the<00:03:05.780> color<00:03:06.549> we've<00:03:07.549> got<00:03:07.730> this<00:03:07.760> nice<00:03:08.209> rich

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:08.840 
from the color we've got this nice rich

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:12.370 
from the color we've got this nice rich
yellow<00:03:09.700> and<00:03:10.700> thought<00:03:11.060> this<00:03:11.390> sauce<00:03:11.690> itself<00:03:12.110> is

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:12.380 
yellow and thought this sauce itself is

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:19.000 
yellow and thought this sauce itself is
starting<00:03:12.739> to<00:03:12.830> kind<00:03:13.040> of<00:03:13.130> thicken<00:03:17.920> so<00:03:18.920> you're

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:19.010 
starting to kind of thicken so you're

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:20.380 
starting to kind of thicken so you're
going<00:03:19.100> to<00:03:19.160> put<00:03:19.340> a<00:03:19.370> little<00:03:19.549> bit<00:03:19.730> more<00:03:19.940> butter<00:03:20.180> in

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:20.390 
going to put a little bit more butter in

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:22.420 
going to put a little bit more butter in
there<00:03:20.540> that<00:03:20.720> we<00:03:21.680> start<00:03:22.010> to<00:03:22.130> get<00:03:22.280> this

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:22.430 
there that we start to get this

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:24.400 
there that we start to get this
thickness<00:03:22.760> going<00:03:23.239> as<00:03:23.660> you<00:03:23.870> can<00:03:23.989> see<00:03:24.200> in<00:03:24.320> the

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:24.410 
thickness going as you can see in the

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:27.970 
thickness going as you can see in the
pan<00:03:25.090> with<00:03:26.090> a<00:03:26.150> mixing<00:03:26.480> bowl<00:03:26.600> rather<00:03:27.049> as<00:03:27.319> it

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:27.980 
pan with a mixing bowl rather as it

starts<00:03:28.250> to<00:03:28.310> get<00:03:28.459> thick<00:03:28.700> and<00:03:28.910> gates<00:03:29.060> and<00:03:29.269> body

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:29.420 
starts to get thick and gates and body

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:31.420 
starts to get thick and gates and body
we<00:03:29.690> can<00:03:29.840> actually<00:03:30.200> add<00:03:30.350> clarified<00:03:30.980> butter<00:03:31.280> a

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:31.430 
we can actually add clarified butter a

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:36.759 
we can actually add clarified butter a
little<00:03:31.579> bit<00:03:31.819> more<00:03:31.970> quickly<00:03:32.269> now<00:03:35.380> and<00:03:36.380> mix<00:03:36.590> that

00:03:36.759 --> 00:03:36.769 
little bit more quickly now and mix that

00:03:36.769 --> 00:03:38.860 
little bit more quickly now and mix that
in<00:03:36.920> together<00:03:37.100> again<00:03:37.850> i<00:03:37.970> just<00:03:38.000> used<00:03:38.390> two<00:03:38.660> egg
