subject<00:01:14.930> to<00:01:15.020> focus<00:01:15.350> on<00:01:15.500> so<00:01:15.650> the<00:01:15.829> the<00:01:16.189> overall

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:16.520 
subject to focus on so the the overall

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:19.179 
subject to focus on so the the overall
Christmas's<00:01:17.180> is<00:01:17.420> average<00:01:17.869> ditto<00:01:18.770> here<00:01:19.040> and

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:23.210 
again there one subject to focus on so

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:25.780 
again there one subject to focus on so
