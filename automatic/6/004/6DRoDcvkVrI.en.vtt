00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:21.000

 hidden that I have a shit skin 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:32.910
 totally it's the disaster 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:35.430
 but here is the life I'm finally from 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:38.280
 puberty of gasoline and low blow 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:39.329
 like many of us I have 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:41.850
 buttons from time to time and today 

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:43.440
 it was perfect day to film because 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:45.360
 that I burgeoned with a thousand fires 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:46.350
 everywhere it's great it's too beautiful and 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:48.960
 it was wonderful 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:50.280
 so it was the perfect opportunity 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:52.920
 we will say to show you how I 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:54.180
 could hide all that so I hope that 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:55.920
 by far you do not see too much 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:57.719
 horrors that do not shock your eyes 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:01.050
 there I am makeup yes yes I am 

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:04.170
 makeup and I made a super wedding 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:06.630
 fresh late super samples and me what 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:08.510
 I like a lot for the time I love you 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:11.040
 explain how I'm doing right now 

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:12.510
 I started with my moisturizer 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:14.280
 darling that I had spoken to you already 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:15.720
 on this channel and that I like a lot 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:17.880
 this is where the cnil could 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:19.110
 ducret technical trends so 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:22.229
 it's a moisturizer that ever 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:23.490
 really everywhere on your face and his 

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:26.189
 cream I like a lot because she 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:27.479
 moisturizes really well and I like to tell myself 

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:27.930
 yes but that buttons by a skin 

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:29.790
 dried 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:31.619
 the problem is that my treatment 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:33.720
 against acne at these games tarpaulin world at 

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:35.970
 pau and suddenly if I make up by 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:37.710
 above it starts to peel everything 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:40.190
 it's a disaster so is a good one 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:42.740
 moisturizer is really necessary 

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:43.760
 do you think I hold the head it takes 

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:45.380
 wait a little bit for it to penetrate 

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:47.450
 so in the meantime I'm going to make up my 

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:49.040
 eyes I drew a kind of small line 

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:50.810
 eyeliner to its ends with a blush to 

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:53.510
 eyelids from these forums this is the 

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:56.750
 must have number 6 and it's a lighthouse 

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:58.490
 dark gray rather dark and matte 

00:01:56.750 --> 00:02:00.440
 so I like it a lot with a little 

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:03.200
 brush to his ends I traced a small 

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:05.210
 awesome black awning liner is it going 

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:07.040
 lower also to call back and for 

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:09.080
 that it redefines my eyes 

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:10.610
 but I did not make a makeup at all 

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:11.750
 very elaborate on the eyes with 

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:15.040
 gradient full of colors and 

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:15.040
 lighting on ista and that 

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:21.120
 then I put my favorite mascara 

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:24.330
 moment that will invest that caused the 

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:25.650
 luxurious life is maxi brush mascara and 

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:28.920
 so invest with a brush 

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:30.780
 currently obese and that I like 

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:33.560
 a lot because it really brings 

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:35.489
 beautiful lob lannoy length conceals 

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:36.870
 so once I had done my 

00:02:35.489 --> 00:02:39.120
 eye makeup that was 

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:40.830
 relatively simple and sober I can 

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:42.810
 put tags and got it because my cream 

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:45.060
 moisturizer had well penetrated into the 

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:47.220
 skin and suddenly it was possible to 

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:49.709
 start the makeup of the spell i 

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:53.459
 applied without surprise my darling 

00:02:49.709 --> 00:02:57.090
 little bp wanted to prevent curtain in 

00:02:53.459 --> 00:02:58.680
 the iss perfector agreement 00 I like 

00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:00.599
 a lot a lot a lot of his time 

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:03.060
 I talk about it all the time in my video 

00:03:00.599 --> 00:03:04.980
 really glad he is very little 

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:07.379
 even if covering them finally I love them 

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:10.109
 hugely sudden so I applied in 

00:03:07.379 --> 00:03:12.930
 patting on my face and then with 

00:03:10.109 --> 00:03:15.720
 my paint brush again is the 

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:18.120
 mineral powder 45 of sephora so with 

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:19.920
 his brushes game background I'm talking about the center 

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:21.780
 to the outside of my face and games 

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:23.250
 do well at the bottom of a pit descendants 

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:25.169
 blow a little on the ears etc 

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:26.579
 even if it's a foundation that is 

00:03:25.169 --> 00:03:28.739
 relatively the color of our skin 

00:03:26.579 --> 00:03:30.329
 we freeze but I really do not 

00:03:28.739 --> 00:03:32.970
 want to have demarcations on the 

00:03:30.329 --> 00:03:35.040
 face so I degrade well the whole the 

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:36.690
 all the way round then we tackle the 

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:38.250
 correction six months that's what I tell you 

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:40.919
 advise if you have imperfections 

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:42.810
 like me to put thin layers 

00:03:40.919 --> 00:03:43.610
 not to put thick layer causes 

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:45.140
 of funds 

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:47.330
 big thick golfers 

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:49.340
 thick layer of powder for me 

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:51.560
 the foundation I put it I put it 

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:53.360
 this is especially my face to unify 

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:55.040
 he has good coverage I am 

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:57.080
 really satisfied but not 

00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:58.250
 enough for you to do what 

00:03:57.080 --> 00:04:00.200
 the imperfections you drive I 'm going 

00:03:58.250 --> 00:04:02.510
 take a more cover of make up for 

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:03.710
 ever and with a brush stroke 

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:05.660
 his purposes that I use for the 

00:04:03.710 --> 00:04:07.670
 corrector is really the duo with 

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:09.170
 rising that makes me feel good to me 

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:11.209
 breathe because I know it's 

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:13.340
 really what will not cover for 

00:04:11.209 --> 00:04:16.310
 my part my imperfections so never 

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:17.959
 really a little bit about my 

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:20.000
 pimples a little bit on my dark circles 

00:04:17.959 --> 00:04:21.320
 I also internally uses it 

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:23.810
 true that we have to defend well because 

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:26.540
 otherwise very thick material but very 

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:28.430
 practice that I like a lot and so that 

00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:30.500
 I put a little everywhere on the 

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:32.240
 imperfections and I tap your finger and 

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:34.460
 then I end up with new ones 

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:36.230
 brushes for ironing for payet 

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:38.560
 demarcation for this be well melted 

00:04:36.230 --> 00:04:38.560
 aero 

00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:43.670
 Once it's over there we have 

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:46.040
 soon finished me i'm going to put my 

00:04:43.670 --> 00:04:47.930
 powder is a sephora powder and it's 

00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:50.540
 the compact matifying powder twitter 

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:53.210
 you located relatively in the air 

00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:53.900
 blurry but she's cool with a big 

00:04:53.210 --> 00:04:55.610
 powder brush 

00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:57.560
 I live everywhere on my face for 

00:04:55.610 --> 00:04:59.600
 mattify effect retain a makeup 

00:04:57.560 --> 00:05:01.580
 especially it's really what I 

00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:03.680
 research for me is the holding of the 

00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:05.690
 makeup then once was 

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:07.550
 finished the wound as an envelope so 

00:05:05.690 --> 00:05:09.500
 this is a blush is an aqua cream 

00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:11.090
 is actually mecha for amber and that's 

00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:12.890
 a great thing that is very good 

00:05:11.090 --> 00:05:14.630
 can use on the lips on the 

00:05:12.890 --> 00:05:17.009
 cheeks on the eyes personally it's 

00:05:14.630 --> 00:05:20.309
 a color that I like a lot about 

00:05:17.009 --> 00:05:21.779
 diot I often apply in bluff it 

00:05:20.309 --> 00:05:23.849
 holds very well and it's a color 

00:05:21.779 --> 00:05:26.369
 pretty cute highly pigmented dont 

00:05:23.849 --> 00:05:27.689
 do not pay attention but then I think that 

00:05:26.369 --> 00:05:29.399
 it happened a little bit the complexion 

00:05:27.689 --> 00:05:31.680
 was a little spring it's a little 

00:05:29.399 --> 00:05:34.559
 little we need color too 

00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:36.360
 I then attacked my 

00:05:34.559 --> 00:05:38.729
 eyebrows with a pencil that I like 

00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:40.469
 many avesnes the pub very 

00:05:38.729 --> 00:05:42.719
 slightly in the eyebrow for a small 

00:05:40.469 --> 00:05:44.580
 little filled the holes can be I 

00:05:42.719 --> 00:05:46.649
 find that the pencil in the eyebrows 

00:05:44.580 --> 00:05:47.969
 his re defines the look these genres in 

00:05:46.649 --> 00:05:49.710
 the more I had done little makeup 

00:05:47.969 --> 00:05:51.240
 eyes there it gives back a little bit 

00:05:49.710 --> 00:05:53.430
 definition look I like a lot 

00:05:51.240 --> 00:05:55.319
 then I finish with your brushes and my 

00:05:53.430 --> 00:05:56.610
 eyebrows so that they are well in 

00:05:55.319 --> 00:05:58.680
 place well the day 

00:05:56.610 --> 00:05:59.969
 last step of this makeup a red 

00:05:58.680 --> 00:06:02.249
 I like a lot of the 

00:05:59.969 --> 00:06:04.169
 brand sephora and it's the unique pink 

00:06:02.249 --> 00:06:05.789
 is actually it's a lipstick that 

00:06:04.169 --> 00:06:09.240
 do not really have colors like that 

00:06:05.789 --> 00:06:10.860
 in the cube and he will adapt to the 

00:06:09.240 --> 00:06:12.870
 toll-fly and change color 

00:06:10.860 --> 00:06:14.789
 according to the ph of volesvres so a priori 

00:06:12.870 --> 00:06:16.379
 it's supposed to be a lipstick 

00:06:14.789 --> 00:06:18.689
 different on each person and that's 

00:06:16.379 --> 00:06:20.430
 so I like it a lot because he 

00:06:18.689 --> 00:06:22.379
 is very discreet a landscape very very 

00:06:20.430 --> 00:06:24.089
 of course it's wise not because 

00:06:22.379 --> 00:06:25.160
 it's something more hydrating so 

00:06:24.089 --> 00:06:27.620
 not bad 

00:06:25.160 --> 00:06:30.200
 is it very comfortable and the color 

00:06:27.620 --> 00:06:31.880
 is so discreetly even time wake up 

00:06:30.200 --> 00:06:33.050
 the makeup I finally find it's 

00:06:31.880 --> 00:06:35.240
 really what we lacked from a 

00:06:33.050 --> 00:06:37.830
 makeup so here I am very happy 

00:06:35.240 --> 00:06:40.810
 of this lipstick I like a lot 

00:06:37.830 --> 00:06:43.090
 I think I went around in my 

00:06:40.810 --> 00:06:44.919
 make up products and tutorials 

00:06:43.090 --> 00:06:48.190
 machiels I hope you liked it 

00:06:44.919 --> 00:06:50.080
 here I say again I have a skin no 

00:06:48.190 --> 00:06:51.880
 shit we can say it's really at 

00:06:50.080 --> 00:06:53.259
 the disaster but I think it can 

00:06:51.880 --> 00:06:55.150
 get to everyone in all 

00:06:53.259 --> 00:06:56.680
 this is a little routine and a 

00:06:55.150 --> 00:06:58.900
 little makeup that I find very 

00:06:56.680 --> 00:07:00.449
 pretty and that can hide the most 

00:06:58.900 --> 00:07:02.199
 possible while being natural 

00:07:00.449 --> 00:07:03.669
 I hope you liked it 

00:07:02.199 --> 00:07:05.650
 please do not hesitate to me 

00:07:03.669 --> 00:07:07.720
 leave my favorite product for the 

00:07:05.650 --> 00:07:10.150
 dyed to have a nice fresh complexion with 

00:07:07.720 --> 00:07:11.530
 spring your favorite to you that
