I'm really excited about this new option
can<00:00:37.290> you<00:00:37.350> tell<00:00:37.500> us<00:00:37.530> a<00:00:37.620> little<00:00:37.650> bit<00:00:37.860> about<00:00:38.100> what

00:00:38.299 --> 00:00:38.309 
can you tell us a little bit about what

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:39.890 
can you tell us a little bit about what
this<00:00:38.400> is<00:00:38.519> going<00:00:38.640> to<00:00:38.699> do<00:00:38.879> for<00:00:39.120> milers<00:00:39.720> with

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:39.900 
this is going to do for milers with

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:41.270 
this is going to do for milers with
their<00:00:40.019> airplanes<00:00:40.320> well<00:00:40.680> we're<00:00:40.949> very<00:00:40.980> excited

engine size design that we've designed

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:51.560 
engine size design that we've designed
here<00:00:50.370> in<00:00:50.460> the<00:00:50.550> US<00:00:50.789> and<00:00:51.030> we're<00:00:51.180> working<00:00:51.420> with<00:00:51.539> a

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570 
here in the US and we're working with a

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:54.290 
here in the US and we're working with a
company<00:00:51.840> and<00:00:52.170> out<00:00:52.469> of<00:00:52.620> st.<00:00:52.829> Louis<00:00:52.859> to<00:00:53.340> come<00:00:54.149> up

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
company and out of st. Louis to come up

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:56.000 
company and out of st. Louis to come up
we<00:00:54.420> came<00:00:54.600> up<00:00:54.750> with<00:00:54.870> a<00:00:54.930> fuel<00:00:55.199> injection<00:00:55.500> system

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
we came up with a fuel injection system

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:58.279 
we came up with a fuel injection system
for<00:00:56.309> this<00:00:56.489> particular<00:00:56.820> engine<00:00:57.120> which<00:00:57.960> will

00:00:58.279 --> 00:00:58.289 
for this particular engine which will

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:00.439 
for this particular engine which will
reduce<00:00:58.500> any<00:00:59.039> need<00:00:59.340> to<00:00:59.370> make<00:00:59.609> any<00:00:59.760> adjustments

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:00.449 
reduce any need to make any adjustments

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:01.639 
reduce any need to make any adjustments
to<00:01:00.510> your<00:01:00.600> engine<00:01:00.989> they<00:01:01.170> get<00:01:01.350> the<00:01:01.440> fuel

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:01.649 
to your engine they get the fuel

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:03.020 
to your engine they get the fuel
injector<00:01:02.039> system<00:01:02.160> those<00:01:02.550> what<00:01:02.730> it<00:01:02.850> needs

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
injector system those what it needs

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:05.270 
injector system those what it needs
delivers<00:01:03.750> it<00:01:03.899> to<00:01:03.929> the<00:01:04.050> engine<00:01:04.259> and<00:01:04.589> it<00:01:05.070> works

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280 
delivers it to the engine and it works

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:07.070 
delivers it to the engine and it works
every<00:01:05.580> single<00:01:05.700> time<00:01:06.030> now

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
every single time now

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:09.139 
every single time now
we've<00:01:07.380> integrated<00:01:07.679> it<00:01:08.130> with<00:01:08.160> the<00:01:08.550> ignition

00:01:09.139 --> 00:01:09.149 
we've integrated it with the ignition

00:01:09.149 --> 00:01:11.300 
we've integrated it with the ignition
system<00:01:09.479> so<00:01:09.840> it<00:01:09.929> only<00:01:09.990> takes<00:01:10.259> a<00:01:10.440> single<00:01:10.619> battery

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
system so it only takes a single battery

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:15.590 
system so it only takes a single battery
it<00:01:11.759> takes<00:01:12.060> a<00:01:12.380> 2s<00:01:13.380> lipo<00:01:13.410> battery<00:01:14.130> about<00:01:14.850> 1300

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
it takes a 2s lipo battery about 1300

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:19.040 
it takes a 2s lipo battery about 1300
the<00:01:15.630> 2000<00:01:16.320> Williams<00:01:16.619> to<00:01:17.460> drive<00:01:17.729> both<00:01:18.390> the<00:01:18.750> fuel

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:19.050 
the 2000 Williams to drive both the fuel

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:20.660 
the 2000 Williams to drive both the fuel
injection<00:01:19.320> system<00:01:19.800> and<00:01:19.950> the<00:01:20.130> ignition<00:01:20.520> system

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
injection system and the ignition system

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:22.640 
injection system and the ignition system
they<00:01:21.450> get<00:01:21.630> plugged<00:01:21.840> in<00:01:22.020> together<00:01:22.170> so<00:01:22.530> they're

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650 
they get plugged in together so they're

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:24.740 
they get plugged in together so they're
integrated<00:01:23.250> so<00:01:23.729> the<00:01:23.850> fuel<00:01:24.060> injection<00:01:24.329> already

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750 
integrated so the fuel injection already

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:26.749 
integrated so the fuel injection already
knows<00:01:25.020> exactly<00:01:25.470> where<00:01:25.979> it<00:01:26.130> needs<00:01:26.280> to<00:01:26.400> be<00:01:26.490> it

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:26.759 
knows exactly where it needs to be it

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:28.069 
knows exactly where it needs to be it
runs<00:01:26.939> off<00:01:27.119> to<00:01:27.150> the<00:01:27.299> magnet<00:01:27.689> that's<00:01:27.810> on<00:01:27.990> the

runs off to the magnet that's on the

runs off to the magnet that's on the
front<00:01:28.229> just<00:01:28.829> like<00:01:28.950> you<00:01:29.159> would<00:01:29.310> with<00:01:29.340> an

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
front just like you would with an

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:31.969 
front just like you would with an
ignition<00:01:29.850> system<00:01:30.829> simple<00:01:31.829> to<00:01:31.950> operate

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979 
ignition system simple to operate

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:34.340 
ignition system simple to operate
doesn't<00:01:32.939> require<00:01:33.119> a<00:01:33.210> three-line<00:01:33.750> fuel<00:01:34.079> tank

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
doesn't require a three-line fuel tank

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:36.050 
doesn't require a three-line fuel tank
because<00:01:34.590> there's<00:01:34.770> a<00:01:34.890> return<00:01:35.220> line<00:01:35.490> from<00:01:35.820> the

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
because there's a return line from the

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:39.380 
because there's a return line from the
carburetor<00:01:37.020> back<00:01:37.829> to<00:01:38.189> the<00:01:38.369> fuel<00:01:38.610> tank<00:01:38.640> to<00:01:39.030> any

unused fuel these someplace to go so it

00:01:42.149 --> 00:01:44.450 
unused fuel these someplace to go so it

fairly normal setup inside of your
airplane<00:01:47.180> typical<00:01:48.180> operation<00:01:48.659> is<00:01:48.810> the<00:01:48.960> first

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170 
airplane typical operation is the first

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:51.020 
airplane typical operation is the first
part<00:01:49.380> of<00:01:49.469> the<00:01:49.590> day<00:01:49.740> we<00:01:50.340> have<00:01:50.460> a<00:01:50.490> little<00:01:50.790> primer

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 
part of the day we have a little primer

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:52.399 
part of the day we have a little primer
bulb<00:01:51.329> to<00:01:51.570> build<00:01:51.780> a<00:01:51.840> little<00:01:51.990> bit<00:01:52.140> of<00:01:52.229> pressure

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:52.409 
bulb to build a little bit of pressure

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:54.319 
bulb to build a little bit of pressure
inside<00:01:52.710> of<00:01:53.009> the<00:01:53.070> throttle<00:01:53.430> body<00:01:53.670> for<00:01:53.969> the<00:01:54.030> just

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:54.329 
inside of the throttle body for the just

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:56.240 
inside of the throttle body for the just
only<00:01:54.479> for<00:01:54.689> the<00:01:54.780> first<00:01:54.930> start<00:01:55.229> of<00:01:55.320> the<00:01:55.439> day<00:01:55.590> then

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:56.250 
only for the first start of the day then

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:58.760 
only for the first start of the day then
it's<00:01:56.430> just<00:01:56.520> turn<00:01:57.180> the<00:01:57.299> system<00:01:57.479> on<00:01:57.750> or<00:01:58.439> maybe

00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:58.770 
it's just turn the system on or maybe

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:00.469
