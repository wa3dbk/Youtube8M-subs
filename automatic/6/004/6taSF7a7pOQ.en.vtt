learning curve on the great scheme of

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:51.889 
learning curve on the great scheme of
things<00:01:48.479> but<00:01:48.899> going<00:01:49.619> back<00:01:50.009> to<00:01:50.460> xbox<00:01:51.060> after

things but going back to xbox after
playing<00:01:52.140> pc<00:01:52.500> for<00:01:52.710> so<00:01:52.829> long<00:01:52.950> was<00:01:53.130> really<00:01:53.670> really

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:53.820 
playing pc for so long was really really

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:55.130 
playing pc for so long was really really
difficult<00:01:54.090> for<00:01:54.450> me<00:01:54.540> because<00:01:54.600> I'm<00:01:54.810> like<00:01:54.930> man

this<00:01:55.350> just<00:01:55.530> feels<00:01:55.740> so<00:01:56.009> much<00:01:56.130> different

00:01:56.230 --> 00:01:56.240 
this just feels so much different

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:58.370 
this just feels so much different
because<00:01:57.240> I'm<00:01:57.420> used<00:01:57.600> to<00:01:57.689> playing<00:01:57.869> in<00:01:58.020> between

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380 
because I'm used to playing in between

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:00.499 
because I'm used to playing in between
like<00:01:58.560> you<00:01:58.680> know<00:01:58.770> like<00:01:58.799> 70<00:01:59.430> 80<00:01:59.610> 90<00:01:59.909> frames<00:02:00.270> per

00:02:00.499 --> 00:02:00.509 
like you know like 70 80 90 frames per

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:04.490 
like you know like 70 80 90 frames per
second<00:02:00.930> versus<00:02:01.290> the<00:02:01.850> standard<00:02:02.850> 30<00:02:03.719> or<00:02:04.020> 29

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:04.500

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:07.219 
second versus the standard 30 or 29
point<00:02:04.890> what<00:02:05.759> is<00:02:05.850> it<00:02:05.969> 92<00:02:06.210> or<00:02:06.540> whatever<00:02:07.049> that's

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:07.229 
point what is it 92 or whatever that's

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:10.969 
point what is it 92 or whatever that's
on<00:02:07.439> the<00:02:07.700> console<00:02:08.700> so<00:02:09.229> it<00:02:10.229> was<00:02:10.379> difficult<00:02:10.560> for

00:02:10.969 --> 00:02:10.979 
on the console so it was difficult for

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:13.190 
on the console so it was difficult for
me<00:02:11.190> to<00:02:11.459> kind<00:02:12.060> of<00:02:12.120> adjust<00:02:12.270> going<00:02:12.840> back<00:02:13.020> and

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:13.200 
me to kind of adjust going back and

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:13.700 
me to kind of adjust going back and
forth

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:13.710 
forth

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:15.680 
forth
I<00:02:13.740> eventually<00:02:14.190> just<00:02:14.460> stop<00:02:14.820> pulling<00:02:15.120> on<00:02:15.180> xbox

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:15.690

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:14.930 
even know that you're going to
eventually<00:03:12.960> like<00:03:13.350> PC<00:03:13.770> gaming<00:03:14.040> because<00:03:14.310> I've

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:14.940 
eventually like PC gaming because I've

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:16.430 
eventually like PC gaming because I've
seen<00:03:15.150> so<00:03:15.330> many<00:03:15.420> people<00:03:15.780> that<00:03:15.930> I've<00:03:16.080> talked<00:03:16.320> to

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:16.440 
seen so many people that I've talked to

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:17.990 
seen so many people that I've talked to
about<00:03:16.560> it<00:03:16.830> you<00:03:16.890> know<00:03:16.920> they<00:03:17.250> come<00:03:17.640> to<00:03:17.760> me<00:03:17.850> than

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:18.000 
about it you know they come to me than

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:19.640 
about it you know they come to me than
like<00:03:18.150> hey<00:03:18.330> I<00:03:18.540> want<00:03:19.050> to<00:03:19.110> do<00:03:19.200> this<00:03:19.350> I<00:03:19.470> want<00:03:19.590> to

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:19.650 
like hey I want to do this I want to

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:21.380 
like hey I want to do this I want to
make<00:03:19.740> the<00:03:19.830> transition<00:03:19.980> they<00:03:20.970> admit<00:03:21.240> they

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:21.390 
make the transition they admit they

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:23.450 
make the transition they admit they
build<00:03:21.630> their<00:03:21.750> computer<00:03:22.140> they<00:03:22.320> play<00:03:23.130> it<00:03:23.280> for

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:23.460 
build their computer they play it for

00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:24.620 
build their computer they play it for
maybe<00:03:23.550> a<00:03:23.670> month<00:03:23.850> and<00:03:24.120> after<00:03:24.330> that<00:03:24.450> they're

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:24.630 
maybe a month and after that they're

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:25.940 
maybe a month and after that they're
back<00:03:24.780> on<00:03:24.810> console<00:03:25.380> just<00:03:25.590> because<00:03:25.800> they're

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:25.950 
back on console just because they're

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:27.380 
back on console just because they're
more<00:03:26.130> used<00:03:26.340> to<00:03:26.400> it<00:03:26.490> so<00:03:26.640> you<00:03:26.730> really<00:03:27.030> have<00:03:27.060> to<00:03:27.360> be

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:27.390 
more used to it so you really have to be

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:29.870 
more used to it so you really have to be
able<00:03:27.600> to<00:03:27.840> commit<00:03:28.140> to<00:03:28.320> it<00:03:28.470> like<00:03:28.650> if<00:03:29.490> you<00:03:29.700> don't

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:29.880 
able to commit to it like if you don't

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:31.010 
able to commit to it like if you don't
think<00:03:30.000> that<00:03:30.180> you're<00:03:30.270> going<00:03:30.390> to<00:03:30.480> do<00:03:30.630> if<00:03:30.870> you're

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:31.020 
think that you're going to do if you're

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:32.750 
think that you're going to do if you're
bad<00:03:31.350> at<00:03:31.500> making<00:03:31.620> commitments<00:03:32.070> you're<00:03:32.400> bad<00:03:32.580> at

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:32.760 
bad at making commitments you're bad at

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:34.430 
bad at making commitments you're bad at
trying<00:03:33.090> to<00:03:33.240> practice<00:03:33.630> as<00:03:33.960> something<00:03:34.230> and<00:03:34.350> get

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:34.440 
trying to practice as something and get

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:35.930 
trying to practice as something and get
better<00:03:34.620> the<00:03:35.130> transition<00:03:35.610> is<00:03:35.670> going<00:03:35.700> to<00:03:35.850> be<00:03:35.910> a

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:35.940 
better the transition is going to be a

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:37.130 
better the transition is going to be a
lot<00:03:36.150> harder<00:03:36.270> because<00:03:36.510> let<00:03:36.720> me<00:03:36.750> tell<00:03:36.810> you<00:03:37.020> guys

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:37.140 
lot harder because let me tell you guys

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:38.990 
lot harder because let me tell you guys
you're<00:03:37.320> going<00:03:37.470> to<00:03:37.530> get<00:03:37.650> your<00:03:37.860> butt<00:03:38.010> kicked<00:03:38.070> for

00:03:38.990 --> 00:03:39.000 
you're going to get your butt kicked for

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:41.870 
you're going to get your butt kicked for
the<00:03:39.060> first<00:03:39.270> you<00:03:40.080> know<00:03:40.200> month<00:03:40.800> to<00:03:41.430> even<00:03:41.730> maybe

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:41.880 
the first you know month to even maybe

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:45.250 
the first you know month to even maybe
two<00:03:42.150> months<00:03:42.300> it's<00:03:42.870> really<00:03:43.170> kind<00:03:43.620> of<00:03:43.680> hard<00:03:43.920> to

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:45.260 
two months it's really kind of hard to

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:47.390 
two months it's really kind of hard to
judge<00:03:46.260> how<00:03:46.500> long<00:03:46.680> it's<00:03:46.830> going<00:03:46.980> to<00:03:47.040> take<00:03:47.130> you

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:47.400 
judge how long it's going to take you

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:48.830 
judge how long it's going to take you
because<00:03:47.550> everybody<00:03:48.000> adjusts<00:03:48.450> differently

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:48.840 
because everybody adjusts differently

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:50.870 
because everybody adjusts differently
but<00:03:49.080> for<00:03:50.010> the<00:03:50.070> most<00:03:50.190> part<00:03:50.280> you<00:03:50.490> just<00:03:50.520> have<00:03:50.760> to

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:50.880 
but for the most part you just have to

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:52.310 
but for the most part you just have to
keep<00:03:51.000> trucking<00:03:51.450> and<00:03:51.630> it'll<00:03:51.990> come<00:03:52.170> to<00:03:52.260> you

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:52.320 
keep trucking and it'll come to you

00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:54.290 
keep trucking and it'll come to you
eventually<00:03:52.500> like<00:03:52.920> my<00:03:53.160> aim<00:03:53.340> is<00:03:53.670> not<00:03:53.700> very<00:03:54.090> good

00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:54.300 
eventually like my aim is not very good

00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:55.640 
eventually like my aim is not very good
at<00:03:54.420> all<00:03:54.570> like<00:03:54.810> I'll<00:03:54.960> be<00:03:55.050> the<00:03:55.170> first<00:03:55.200> to<00:03:55.440> tell

00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:55.650 
at all like I'll be the first to tell

00:03:55.650 --> 00:03:57.530 
at all like I'll be the first to tell
you<00:03:55.710> that<00:03:55.770> like<00:03:56.130> oftentimes<00:03:56.880> I<00:03:57.150> find<00:03:57.180> myself

00:03:57.530 --> 00:03:57.540 
you that like oftentimes I find myself

00:03:57.540 --> 00:03:59.390 
you that like oftentimes I find myself
trying<00:03:57.930> to<00:03:58.170> track<00:03:58.410> people<00:03:58.590> and<00:03:58.950> it's<00:03:59.040> a<00:03:59.160> little

00:03:59.390 --> 00:03:59.400 
trying to track people and it's a little

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:01.160 
trying to track people and it's a little
bit<00:03:59.520> harder<00:03:59.790> for<00:03:59.940> me<00:04:00.030> to<00:04:00.060> judge<00:04:00.360> like<00:04:00.630> some

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:01.170 
bit harder for me to judge like some

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:02.540 
bit harder for me to judge like some
days<00:04:01.320> are<00:04:01.470> better<00:04:01.620> than<00:04:01.740> others<00:04:01.890> it<00:04:02.310> really

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:02.550 
days are better than others it really

00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:05.120 
days are better than others it really
just<00:04:02.700> depends<00:04:03.060> on<00:04:03.270> what<00:04:03.750> kind<00:04:04.470> of<00:04:04.680> mood<00:04:04.740> i'm<00:04:05.010> in

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:05.130 
just depends on what kind of mood i'm in

00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:07.820 
just depends on what kind of mood i'm in
i<00:04:05.250> guess<00:04:05.520> i<00:04:05.730> guess<00:04:06.030> but<00:04:06.500> for<00:04:07.500> the<00:04:07.560> most<00:04:07.710> part

00:04:07.820 --> 00:04:07.830 
i guess i guess but for the most part

00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:09.560 
i guess i guess but for the most part
your<00:04:08.100> aim<00:04:08.250> will<00:04:08.460> come<00:04:08.670> with<00:04:09.030> time<00:04:09.240> I<00:04:09.300> mean

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:09.570 
your aim will come with time I mean

00:04:09.570 --> 00:04:10.670 
your aim will come with time I mean
that's<00:04:09.630> just<00:04:09.870> something<00:04:10.050> that<00:04:10.260> you<00:04:10.350> get<00:04:10.500> used

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:10.680 
that's just something that you get used

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:12.410 
that's just something that you get used
to<00:04:10.770> you<00:04:10.980> know<00:04:11.070> the<00:04:11.190> muscle<00:04:11.520> memory<00:04:11.700> builds<00:04:12.330> up

00:04:12.410 --> 00:04:12.420 
to you know the muscle memory builds up

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:14.000 
to you know the muscle memory builds up
in<00:04:12.540> your<00:04:12.570> hand<00:04:12.900> but<00:04:13.080> it<00:04:13.350> is<00:04:13.590> not<00:04:13.710> impossible

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:14.010 
in your hand but it is not impossible

00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:17.539 
in your hand but it is not impossible
guys<00:04:14.460> I<00:04:15.330> think<00:04:16.170> it<00:04:16.260> helps<00:04:16.620> if<00:04:16.920> you've<00:04:17.100> grown<00:04:17.370> up

00:04:17.539 --> 00:04:17.549 
guys I think it helps if you've grown up

00:04:17.549 --> 00:04:19.099 
guys I think it helps if you've grown up
with<00:04:17.700> computers<00:04:18.150> obviously<00:04:18.630> you're<00:04:18.750> used<00:04:18.960> to

00:04:19.099 --> 00:04:19.109 
with computers obviously you're used to

00:04:19.109 --> 00:04:21.200 
with computers obviously you're used to
a<00:04:19.140> mouse<00:04:19.380> but<00:04:19.770> it's<00:04:20.010> a<00:04:20.310> weird<00:04:20.489> transition<00:04:20.730> to

00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:21.210 
a mouse but it's a weird transition to

00:04:21.210 --> 00:04:25.140 
a mouse but it's a weird transition to
kind<00:04:21.420> of<00:04:21.510> think<00:04:21.750> about<00:04:22.250> adding<00:04:23.250> the<00:04:23.790> mouse<00:04:24.090> as

00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:25.150 
kind of think about adding the mouse as

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:26.430 
kind of think about adding the mouse as
you<00:04:25.180> know<00:04:25.270> the<00:04:25.389> moving<00:04:25.750> around<00:04:25.840> and<00:04:26.290> moving

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:26.440 
you know the moving around and moving

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:28.140 
you know the moving around and moving
your<00:04:26.620> gun<00:04:26.830> it's<00:04:27.009> kind<00:04:27.370> of<00:04:27.430> weird<00:04:27.639> going<00:04:27.729> from

00:04:28.140 --> 00:04:28.150 
your gun it's kind of weird going from

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:30.840 
your gun it's kind of weird going from
Council<00:04:28.570> to<00:04:28.780> pc<00:04:29.139> so<00:04:29.410> just<00:04:30.160> keep<00:04:30.280> trying<00:04:30.580> and

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:30.850 
Council to pc so just keep trying and

00:04:30.850 --> 00:04:32.280 
Council to pc so just keep trying and
it'll<00:04:31.150> eventually<00:04:31.300> come<00:04:31.780> with<00:04:32.020> time<00:04:32.259> I

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:32.290 
it'll eventually come with time I

00:04:32.290 --> 00:04:35.790 
it'll eventually come with time I
promise<00:04:32.889> but<00:04:33.669> another<00:04:33.880> another<00:04:34.360> tip<00:04:35.080> that<00:04:35.110> I<00:04:35.320> i

00:04:35.790 --> 00:04:35.800 
promise but another another tip that I i

but I found that when I was learning to
use<00:04:44.680> the<00:04:44.860> pc<00:04:45.190> it<00:04:45.310> was<00:04:45.400> a<00:04:45.430> lot<00:04:45.729> easier<00:04:45.940> to<00:04:46.240> start

that<00:04:58.960> sounds<00:04:59.350> horrible<00:04:59.590> well<00:05:00.250> I<00:05:00.520> use<00:05:00.820> toggle

00:05:01.290 --> 00:05:01.300 
that sounds horrible well I use toggle

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:03.570 
that sounds horrible well I use toggle
up<00:05:01.539> until<00:05:02.020> about<00:05:02.169> a<00:05:02.380> month<00:05:02.560> ago<00:05:02.979> and<00:05:03.280> I<00:05:03.310> finally

00:05:03.570 --> 00:05:03.580 
up until about a month ago and I finally

00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:05.520 
up until about a month ago and I finally
weaned<00:05:03.940> myself<00:05:04.060> off<00:05:04.570> of<00:05:04.630> it<00:05:04.900> I<00:05:04.930> found<00:05:05.229> it<00:05:05.380> was<00:05:05.500> a

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:05.530 
weaned myself off of it I found it was a

00:05:05.530 --> 00:05:07.950 
weaned myself off of it I found it was a
lot<00:05:05.740> easier<00:05:05.770> to<00:05:06.100> start<00:05:06.430> with<00:05:06.760> toggle<00:05:07.210> just

00:05:07.950 --> 00:05:07.960 
lot easier to start with toggle just

00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:09.090 
lot easier to start with toggle just
because<00:05:08.110> it<00:05:08.229> helps<00:05:08.470> you<00:05:08.560> aim<00:05:08.740> a<00:05:08.770> little<00:05:08.919> bit

00:05:09.090 --> 00:05:09.100 
because it helps you aim a little bit

00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:11.520 
because it helps you aim a little bit
more<00:05:09.250> it<00:05:09.370> seems<00:05:09.610> to<00:05:09.789> be<00:05:09.940> easier<00:05:10.930> to<00:05:10.990> adjust

00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:11.530 
more it seems to be easier to adjust

00:05:11.530 --> 00:05:13.740 
more it seems to be easier to adjust
going<00:05:12.160> from<00:05:12.400> using<00:05:12.699> a<00:05:12.789> controller<00:05:13.120> to<00:05:13.389> a<00:05:13.419> mouse

00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:13.750 
going from using a controller to a mouse

00:05:13.750 --> 00:05:15.570 
going from using a controller to a mouse
when<00:05:14.410> you<00:05:14.500> have<00:05:14.650> toggle<00:05:15.100> aim<00:05:15.160> down<00:05:15.340> sight

00:05:15.570 --> 00:05:15.580 
when you have toggle aim down sight

00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:16.980 
when you have toggle aim down sight
because<00:05:15.729> with<00:05:15.910> the<00:05:16.000> controller<00:05:16.389> it's<00:05:16.630> no<00:05:16.780> big

00:05:16.980 --> 00:05:16.990 
because with the controller it's no big

00:05:16.990 --> 00:05:19.020 
because with the controller it's no big
big<00:05:17.500> deal<00:05:17.710> just<00:05:17.740> to<00:05:18.160> sit<00:05:18.340> there<00:05:18.460> and<00:05:18.520> hold<00:05:18.789> the

00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:19.030 
big deal just to sit there and hold the

00:05:19.030 --> 00:05:20.939 
big deal just to sit there and hold the
right<00:05:19.240> trigger<00:05:19.479> as<00:05:19.720> you<00:05:19.870> aim<00:05:20.050> it<00:05:20.349> was<00:05:20.800> with<00:05:20.919> a

00:05:20.939 --> 00:05:20.949 
right trigger as you aim it was with a

00:05:20.949 --> 00:05:22.560 
right trigger as you aim it was with a
mouse<00:05:21.220> it's<00:05:21.460> a<00:05:21.520> little<00:05:21.760> bit<00:05:21.849> more<00:05:22.000> tricky<00:05:22.210> just

00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:22.570 
mouse it's a little bit more tricky just

00:05:22.570 --> 00:05:24.150 
mouse it's a little bit more tricky just
because<00:05:22.840> of<00:05:22.960> the<00:05:23.020> way<00:05:23.169> your<00:05:23.320> hand<00:05:23.590> has<00:05:23.800> to<00:05:23.979> kind

00:05:24.150 --> 00:05:24.160 
because of the way your hand has to kind

00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:26.820 
because of the way your hand has to kind
of<00:05:24.250> contort<00:05:24.699> to<00:05:24.940> hold<00:05:25.150> it<00:05:25.410> so<00:05:26.410> it<00:05:26.500> does<00:05:26.650> take

00:05:26.820 --> 00:05:26.830 
of contort to hold it so it does take

00:05:26.830 --> 00:05:28.350 
of contort to hold it so it does take
time<00:05:27.009> I<00:05:27.070> found<00:05:27.400> that<00:05:27.610> if<00:05:27.729> you<00:05:27.820> start<00:05:28.060> with<00:05:28.180> that

00:05:28.350 --> 00:05:28.360 
time I found that if you start with that

00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:29.850 
time I found that if you start with that
and<00:05:28.419> you<00:05:28.599> kind<00:05:28.810> of<00:05:28.900> wean<00:05:29.080> yourself<00:05:29.199> off<00:05:29.560> of<00:05:29.740> it

00:05:29.850 --> 00:05:29.860 
and you kind of wean yourself off of it

00:05:29.860 --> 00:05:31.560 
and you kind of wean yourself off of it
you<00:05:29.979> do<00:05:30.160> tend<00:05:30.520> to<00:05:30.760> have<00:05:31.180> better<00:05:31.360> results

00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:31.570 
you do tend to have better results

00:05:31.570 --> 00:05:33.330 
you do tend to have better results
that's<00:05:31.960> just<00:05:32.139> my<00:05:32.229> personal<00:05:32.620> experience<00:05:33.130> lying

00:05:41.189 --> 00:05:41.199 
found it a little bit more advantageous

00:05:41.199 --> 00:05:42.870 
found it a little bit more advantageous
just<00:05:41.740> to<00:05:41.889> have<00:05:42.039> it<00:05:42.070> on<00:05:42.280> normal<00:05:42.460> aim<00:05:42.729> down
