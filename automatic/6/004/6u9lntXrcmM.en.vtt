00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
like a canvas sort of texture and then

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:05.450 
like a canvas sort of texture and then
we've<00:01:04.110> also<00:01:04.289> put<00:01:04.589> a<00:01:04.619> three-dimensional

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:39.910 
everything on the face there are set
patterns<00:01:37.259> that<00:01:37.740> we<00:01:38.280> define<00:01:39.210> as<00:01:39.240> expressions

00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:39.920 
patterns that we define as expressions

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:42.109 
patterns that we define as expressions
Alex<00:01:40.920> worked<00:01:41.100> out<00:01:41.220> on<00:01:41.369> the<00:01:41.490> art<00:01:41.640> department

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:48.119 
patterns along the way we realized well

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:50.240 
patterns along the way we realized well
we're<00:01:48.990> gonna<00:01:49.110> be<00:01:49.229> faithful<00:01:49.439> to<00:01:49.680> the<00:01:49.890> graphic

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250

put into each panel and how they would
change<00:01:58.140> sometimes<00:01:58.680> we<00:01:59.280> wanted<00:01:59.520> to<00:01:59.610> get<00:01:59.759> that
