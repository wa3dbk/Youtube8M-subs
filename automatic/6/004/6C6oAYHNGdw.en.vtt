00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:04.790
 we had a story hanging from the bakers of esplús five hours 

00:00:04.790 --> 00:00:09.670
 After processing and with the wood oven at 230 degrees it is time to 

00:00:09.670 --> 00:00:12.670
 start lay the bread 

00:00:13.689 --> 00:00:16.409
 beyond the time of granting 

00:00:16.409 --> 00:00:17.480
 so is 

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:20.039
 for fermented is at its point 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:24.439
 now we put a little napoles on top to burn him then he gives a 

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:27.390
 point that more more good is worth 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:31.810
 If everything handcrafted the whole process all process and the texts all the way up 

00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:33.780
 wood oven with shovel 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:36.340
 porn with the stone where it cooks 

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:39.410
 as it has always been done 

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:43.140
 I am going to give of subjects there is going to stop was for many years preta deserves that 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:44.460
 you are 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:46.320
 professional musician 11 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:48.480
 I loved him and 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:51.030
 It helps me to avoid a bit of 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:52.600
 of what networking is 

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:56.010
 but if today he wins he worked last night he always does it because of the groping 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:57.650
 the music of always at night 

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:59.569
 it is expected that it is a bit 4 

00:00:59.569 --> 00:01:01.620
 but August hours is 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:03.960
 look for the monotony of this 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:07.140
 in the scale and applied of those who are so beautiful and that you are whereabouts 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:08.440
 for 20 years 

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:11.960
 seven weeks next steps but this is also a diploma in education 

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:16.100
 social if so that of table that the race to by the uned also for 

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:18.180
 have some other step more and try 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:22.170
 i but well here we are fighting that we are fighting good already happened to me 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:24.180
 gloves again you want too 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:28.070
 but at the same time I was going to put the bread in the oven arséne helps and so much that yes and 

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:31.000
 there will always be easy 

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.630
 first we are going to put the bread prepared the shovel 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:36.000
 we put a little napoles top 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:37.980
 spurred 

00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:40.910
 I will not say anything about the world 

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:43.910
 since it is the one that makes the shovel catch without fear 

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:48.080
 It's a little bit and with the bread, too, but you'll see how to distribute 

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:51.210
 enter the fallacy inside the door 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:53.729
 do for Farah that one there 

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:54.850
 a little more 

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:58.619
 and now with the guerrilla now when you see strongly behind 

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:01.619
 strong without fear 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:05.610
 and it is that this is a trade after falling a little into oblivion 

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:11.459
 it is a profession that as we do it is condemned 

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:14.719
 unless you can not get it 

00:02:14.719 --> 00:02:19.439
 Well, to give value to this type of bread because its part practically 

00:02:19.439 --> 00:02:22.309
 you can not find we are very few for those of us who still carry the same 

00:02:22.309 --> 00:02:24.609
 process as like all of life 

00:02:24.609 --> 00:02:28.810
 cooking it this way giving you your time so then the final product 

00:02:28.809 --> 00:02:32.329
 well, that is differentiating with respect to the plans that are made 

00:02:32.329 --> 00:02:33.829
 more industrial way 

00:02:33.829 --> 00:02:37.549
 it is hours later eduardo yedro of the guide you can get something true 

00:02:38.239 --> 00:02:41.099
 because boyle very well brown and the pint 

00:02:41.099 --> 00:02:44.099
 that's what he tells us that he even pointed 

00:02:44.949 --> 00:02:49.159
 to get the amount of goods two kilos of bread two kilos 

00:02:49.159 --> 00:02:50.759
 about 2 - chelsea 

00:02:50.759 --> 00:02:52.109
 small palmero 

00:02:52.109 --> 00:02:53.839
 Juan, what do we do with this hour? 

00:02:53.839 --> 00:02:56.939
 to cassano home directly to home is caught 

00:02:56.939 --> 00:02:59.939
 without fear 

00:03:00.649 --> 00:03:02.390
 but the food agency 

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:03.669
 the one who feeds 

00:03:03.669 --> 00:03:05.969
 The sixth special presentation is not 

00:03:05.969 --> 00:03:07.160
 yes cd 

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:08.309
 it's a presentation 

00:03:08.309 --> 00:03:12.059
 that I think is up to the product because if to express it we are 

00:03:12.059 --> 00:03:12.739
 different 

00:03:12.739 --> 00:03:13.740
 Maria Victoria 

00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:17.890
 ban said jobs you could say because nothing is the same that there are two equal 

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:20.709
 out of topic ensure is that tomorrow 

00:03:20.709 --> 00:03:23.869

00:03:26.719 --> 00:03:29.349
 there are many thanks the flower of esplús for you 

00:03:29.349 --> 00:03:31.439
