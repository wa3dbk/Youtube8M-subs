00:00:00.029 --> 00:00:03.440
 I like very much 

00:00:03.440 --> 00:00:06.870
 when the 

00:00:08.989 --> 00:00:10.729
 3 

00:00:10.729 --> 00:00:14.569
 3-1 min 

00:00:15.099 --> 00:00:19.060
 one as always I requested 14 

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:23.609
 and I'll give a tutorial on how to play the only server and game mode remove 

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:24.539
 your clubs 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:30.060
 good in this game at the beginning you must choose a team are network 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:35.050
 owned the red then the club that the subsequent ones as the site that serves to 

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:37.510
 do not play until the next round 

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:39.980
 I always choose any team 

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:45.070
 well let's start with the game had only goal is to survive good not 

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:50.750
 you alone but your entire team and kill all your rivals if your opponent has 

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:56.330
 more players than your team when they kill you will be revived to play one 2 

00:00:56.330 --> 00:01:02.580
 With more games when the round is over you can change your team by 

00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:06.970
 example if you were in the red team if you want you can play the team 

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:12.360
 Blue for getting out of the round with the sector if you continue on your own team 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:17.620
 exchange the places of the beginning for example if I started where I started 

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:21.980
 A while ago he moved to another place where his rival had started 

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:27.110
 He also exchanges the characters although there is no need if you change to 

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:31.460
 another team will be in the same beginning and the same character though 

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:36.990
 there are players who could be rookies playing this ja ja p killed 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:37.720
 one 

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:42.070
 and another thing if your team that has more players of its rival if they kill you 

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:47.320
 you were out of the round until the next round we're going for those idiots 

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:52.840
 hahaha good in this service there is no administrator as they are 

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:57.350
 called the two come there are none on this server and there are many many 

00:01:57.350 --> 00:02:00.680
 looting the fierce fight he had and drums 

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:06.270
 the cadets have infinite life ain already know how the packers are 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:10.360
 dairy products are those that have many programs open and brings problems to the 

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:15.640
 be pouring us the assholes are the ones who kill each other and the 

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:20.530
 campers are the ones who hide in a strategic place to kill and stay 

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:23.329
 all the time in the same place 

00:02:23.329 --> 00:02:34.589
 There is only one left to be able to baa one more is left and that is what I tell you 

00:02:34.589 --> 00:02:35.699
 he is a cowboy 

00:02:35.699 --> 00:02:41.849
 childress won the game when a large team will appear again the 

00:02:41.849 --> 00:02:47.269
 option to change good team I hope you have learned less points 

00:02:47.269 --> 00:02:49.499

00:02:49.499 --> 00:02:52.949
