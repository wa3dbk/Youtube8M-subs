00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.659 

while<00:00:00.930> we<00:00:01.110> were<00:00:01.260> recently<00:00:01.500> in<00:00:01.890> South<00:00:02.100> Africa

00:00:02.659 --> 00:00:02.669 
while we were recently in South Africa

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:04.970 
while we were recently in South Africa
we<00:00:02.820> had<00:00:02.970> the<00:00:03.120> rare<00:00:03.419> imitation<00:00:04.290> by<00:00:04.500> Sharon

00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:04.980 
we had the rare imitation by Sharon

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:08.270 
we had the rare imitation by Sharon
Johnson<00:00:05.640> and<00:00:05.850> the<00:00:06.450> Belgravia<00:00:07.170> high<00:00:07.440> school<00:00:07.830> to

00:00:08.270 --> 00:00:08.280 
Johnson and the Belgravia high school to

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:11.450 
Johnson and the Belgravia high school to
come<00:00:08.519> and<00:00:08.730> teach<00:00:08.970> tre<00:00:09.599> to<00:00:10.019> the<00:00:10.170> students<00:00:10.830> we

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:11.460 
come and teach tre to the students we

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:14.810 
come and teach tre to the students we
had<00:00:11.639> about<00:00:11.940> 300<00:00:12.870> students<00:00:13.410> in<00:00:13.679> a<00:00:14.400> giant

00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:14.820 
had about 300 students in a giant

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:17.750 
had about 300 students in a giant
gymnasium<00:00:15.809> and<00:00:16.049> we<00:00:16.199> had<00:00:16.440> the<00:00:16.619> great<00:00:17.160> fun<00:00:17.520> of

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:17.760 
gymnasium and we had the great fun of

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:32.139 
gymnasium and we had the great fun of
teaching<00:00:18.240> them<00:00:18.420> tre

00:00:32.139 --> 00:00:32.149 

00:00:32.149 --> 00:00:55.070 

then

00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:55.080 

00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:58.050 

we<00:00:56.080> separated<00:00:56.770> the<00:00:57.010> boys<00:00:57.250> from<00:00:57.490> the<00:00:57.580> girls

00:00:58.050 --> 00:00:58.060 
we separated the boys from the girls

00:00:58.060 --> 00:01:00.229 
we separated the boys from the girls
because<00:00:58.690> of<00:00:58.720> cultural<00:00:59.530> and<00:00:59.890> social

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
because of cultural and social

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:03.960 
because of cultural and social
differences<00:01:01.239> and<00:01:01.590> then<00:01:02.590> we<00:01:03.040> simply<00:01:03.489> guided

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:03.970 
differences and then we simply guided

00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:06.570 
differences and then we simply guided
them<00:01:04.150> through<00:01:04.180> the<00:01:04.540> exercises<00:01:05.110> as<00:01:05.620> a<00:01:06.070> way<00:01:06.400> of

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:06.580 
them through the exercises as a way of

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:09.240 
them through the exercises as a way of
demonstrating<00:01:06.820> that<00:01:07.630> you<00:01:07.840> can<00:01:08.200> do<00:01:08.590> trauma

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:09.250 
demonstrating that you can do trauma

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:11.540 
demonstrating that you can do trauma
reducing<00:01:09.850> exercises<00:01:10.630> with<00:01:11.140> large

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:11.550 
reducing exercises with large

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:14.010 
reducing exercises with large
populations<00:01:12.550> of<00:01:12.670> people<00:01:13.270> who<00:01:13.420> experience

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:14.020 
populations of people who experience

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:16.140 
populations of people who experience
stress<00:01:14.440> and<00:01:14.740> traumas<00:01:15.310> part<00:01:15.640> of<00:01:15.790> their<00:01:15.910> daily

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:16.150 
stress and traumas part of their daily

00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:21.020 
stress and traumas part of their daily
life<00:01:18.570> once<00:01:19.570> we<00:01:19.869> did<00:01:20.080> the<00:01:20.140> standing<00:01:20.830> exercises

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
life once we did the standing exercises

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:23.940 
life once we did the standing exercises
the<00:01:22.030> next<00:01:22.360> thing<00:01:22.570> to<00:01:22.750> do<00:01:22.930> is<00:01:23.140> to<00:01:23.320> lay<00:01:23.470> down<00:01:23.500> on

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:23.950 
the next thing to do is to lay down on

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:26.100 
the next thing to do is to lay down on
the<00:01:24.070> floor<00:01:24.369> to<00:01:25.060> activate<00:01:25.660> the<00:01:25.810> tremor

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:26.110 
the floor to activate the tremor

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:29.190 
the floor to activate the tremor
mechanism<00:01:26.890> so<00:01:27.430> they<00:01:27.640> could<00:01:27.880> passively<00:01:28.600> allow

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:29.200 
mechanism so they could passively allow

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:31.320 
mechanism so they could passively allow
the<00:01:29.259> tremors<00:01:29.920> to<00:01:30.070> travel<00:01:30.550> through<00:01:30.790> the<00:01:30.910> muscle

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:31.330 
the tremors to travel through the muscle

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:33.950 
the tremors to travel through the muscle
tissue<00:01:31.540> the<00:01:31.840> body<00:01:32.110> and<00:01:32.470> feel<00:01:32.740> the<00:01:32.920> effects

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960 
tissue the body and feel the effects

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:37.200 
tissue the body and feel the effects
what<00:01:34.960> is<00:01:35.140> also<00:01:35.410> important<00:01:36.220> for<00:01:36.430> us<00:01:36.520> is<00:01:36.910> that<00:01:36.940> we

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:37.210 
what is also important for us is that we

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:39.930 
what is also important for us is that we
went<00:01:37.509> around<00:01:37.600> giving<00:01:38.380> every<00:01:38.890> student<00:01:38.940> some

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:39.940 
went around giving every student some

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:42.270 
went around giving every student some
individual<00:01:40.720> and<00:01:40.930> personal<00:01:41.500> attention<00:01:41.830> you

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:42.280 
individual and personal attention you

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:44.400 
individual and personal attention you
wanted<00:01:42.940> to<00:01:43.090> make<00:01:43.360> sure<00:01:43.630> that<00:01:43.810> they<00:01:44.020> knew<00:01:44.229> they

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:44.410 
wanted to make sure that they knew they

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:58.960 
wanted to make sure that they knew they
were<00:01:44.470> seen<00:01:44.800> by<00:01:45.070> us

00:01:58.960 --> 00:01:58.970 

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:02.030 

after<00:01:59.970> they<00:02:00.119> finished<00:02:00.540> the<00:02:00.689> exercises<00:02:01.590> we<00:02:01.830> let

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:02.040 
after they finished the exercises we let

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:04.010 
after they finished the exercises we let
them<00:02:02.189> lay<00:02:02.430> down<00:02:02.700> and<00:02:02.939> rest<00:02:03.149> for<00:02:03.479> a<00:02:03.570> little<00:02:03.780> bit

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:04.020 
them lay down and rest for a little bit

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:06.080 
them lay down and rest for a little bit
so<00:02:04.320> that<00:02:04.500> they<00:02:04.649> could<00:02:04.860> reintegrate<00:02:05.670> from<00:02:06.000> the

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:06.090 
so that they could reintegrate from the

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:08.240 
so that they could reintegrate from the
work<00:02:06.299> they<00:02:06.509> did<00:02:06.780> come<00:02:07.470> back<00:02:07.649> to<00:02:07.710> a<00:02:07.979> very

conscious<00:02:08.940> state<00:02:09.209> of<00:02:09.360> mind<00:02:09.630> so<00:02:09.869> they<00:02:09.989> could

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:10.170 
conscious state of mind so they could

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:30.620 
conscious state of mind so they could
walk<00:02:10.350> out<00:02:10.590> being<00:02:11.009> integrated<00:02:11.700> and<00:02:29.420> then<00:02:30.420> we

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:30.630 
walk out being integrated and then we

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:33.440 
walk out being integrated and then we
