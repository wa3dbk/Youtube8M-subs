we're<00:00:20.310> to<00:00:20.490> kneel<00:00:20.670> down<00:00:20.910> and<00:00:21.210> no<00:00:21.420> part<00:00:22.020> of<00:00:22.080> me

minutes left and I was like there's no

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:30.380 
minutes left and I was like there's no
way<00:00:28.050> to<00:00:28.769> make<00:00:28.949> it<00:00:29.010> to<00:00:29.340> make<00:00:29.519> any<00:00:29.640> substitutions

village just isn't quick enough to get
to<00:00:33.630> stage<00:00:34.050> and<00:00:34.290> Suarez<00:00:35.300> Fellaini<00:00:36.300> I<00:00:36.510> think

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:36.870 
to stage and Suarez Fellaini I think

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:38.810 
to stage and Suarez Fellaini I think
fellaini<00:00:37.230> looks<00:00:37.469> like<00:00:37.620> a<00:00:37.680> liability<00:00:37.920> all<00:00:38.520> the

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:38.820 
fellaini looks like a liability all the

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:41.869 
fellaini looks like a liability all the
time<00:00:39.829> are<00:00:40.829> you<00:00:40.890> up<00:00:41.160> for<00:00:41.190> it<00:00:41.399> was<00:00:41.579> better<00:00:41.760> than

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879 
time are you up for it was better than

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:43.850 
time are you up for it was better than
character<00:00:42.270> day<00:00:42.510> which<00:00:43.290> doesn't<00:00:43.649> say<00:00:43.770> a<00:00:43.800> lot

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:43.860 
character day which doesn't say a lot

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:45.619 
character day which doesn't say a lot
yeah<00:00:44.309> yeah<00:00:44.670> I<00:00:44.700> mean<00:00:44.910> they're<00:00:45.120> both<00:00:45.239> but<00:00:45.480> it's

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:45.629 
yeah yeah I mean they're both but it's

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:47.779 
yeah yeah I mean they're both but it's
just<00:00:45.780> just<00:00:45.930> like<00:00:46.140> we<00:00:46.920> need<00:00:47.100> two<00:00:47.309> central

00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:47.789 
just just like we need two central

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:50.420 
just just like we need two central
midfielders<00:00:48.329> so<00:00:48.600> badly<00:00:48.930> also<00:00:49.860> I<00:00:50.100> think<00:00:50.160> it's

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
midfielders so badly also I think it's

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:52.819 
midfielders so badly also I think it's
just<00:00:50.579> like<00:00:50.700> when<00:00:51.239> you<00:00:51.360> have<00:00:51.539> Jana<00:00:52.020> say<00:00:52.289> and

it's like he's

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:14.520 
it's like he's
they're<00:02:13.060> just<00:02:13.330> thinking<00:02:13.510> like<00:02:13.870> how<00:02:14.200> is<00:02:14.380> this

their squads we should at least be
challenging<00:02:47.200> for<00:02:47.230> the<00:02:47.380> top<00:02:47.560> for<00:02:48.630> quite<00:02:49.630> easily

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:49.930

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:54.970 
I keep I keep maybe thinking my eyes

I keep I keep maybe thinking my eyes
will<00:02:55.630> do<00:02:55.810> well<00:02:56.050> but<00:02:56.380> I<00:02:56.620> think<00:02:57.520> it<00:02:57.610> was<00:02:57.700> I<00:02:57.760> think

00:02:57.960 --> 00:02:57.970 
will do well but I think it was I think

00:02:57.970 --> 00:02:59.550 
will do well but I think it was I think
I<00:02:58.180> was<00:02:58.300> wrong<00:02:58.450> I<00:02:58.660> said<00:02:58.720> at<00:02:58.960> the<00:02:59.020> beginning<00:02:59.080> I

00:02:59.550 --> 00:02:59.560 
I was wrong I said at the beginning I

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:00.930 
I was wrong I said at the beginning I
think<00:02:59.830> Mourinho<00:03:00.250> should<00:03:00.400> have<00:03:00.490> got<00:03:00.610> the<00:03:00.700> job

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:00.940

think Mourinho should have got the job
but<00:03:01.540> I<00:03:01.600> wanted<00:03:02.440> him<00:03:02.680> to<00:03:02.710> do<00:03:03.010> well<00:03:03.190> because<00:03:03.430> I

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:03.670 
but I wanted him to do well because I

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:05.940 
but I wanted him to do well because I
thought<00:03:03.880> it<00:03:04.450> was<00:03:04.630> almost<00:03:04.810> just<00:03:05.050> like<00:03:05.110> a<00:03:05.200> nice

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:05.950 
thought it was almost just like a nice

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:08.610 
thought it was almost just like a nice
idea<00:03:06.880> that<00:03:07.150> we<00:03:07.240> wouldn't<00:03:07.840> be<00:03:07.990> like<00:03:08.200> a<00:03:08.230> people

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:08.620 
idea that we wouldn't be like a people

idea that we wouldn't be like a people
club<00:03:08.860> and<00:03:09.130> we'll<00:03:09.490> get<00:03:09.670> someone<00:03:09.970> in<00:03:10.150> and<00:03:10.360> they

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:10.450 
club and we'll get someone in and they

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:15.540 
club and we'll get someone in and they
would<00:03:10.570> do<00:03:10.690> well<00:03:10.900> but<00:03:11.170> hasn't<00:03:12.070> worked<00:03:12.280> out<00:03:14.550> them

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:15.550
