the<00:01:00.149> sugar<00:01:00.329> may<00:01:00.600> vary<00:01:00.870> because<00:01:01.530> the<00:01:02.219> fruit

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
the sugar may vary because the fruit

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:05.870 
the sugar may vary because the fruit
tartness<00:01:03.030> will<00:01:03.539> vary<00:01:03.809> and<00:01:04.439> rhubarb<00:01:05.309> is<00:01:05.549> very
