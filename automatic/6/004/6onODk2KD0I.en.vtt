00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:41.280

00:00:52.440 --> 00:01:00.210
 rain and snow and ice cold but not for 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:02.430
 ado let's get to the subject 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:04.860

 Very cool, I 'll show you around now. 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:11.010
 same 

00:01:08.659 --> 00:01:14.390
 first child to show that the 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:17.729
 deck trample regular deck're 

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:22.680
 normal is because it really has all 

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:25.560
 the cards of the common deck done this 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:27.450
 Do not do the following you lose your 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:31.490
 spectator to pick up some card can be 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:31.490
 anyone independent of the order here 

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:39.350
 144 gold 

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:54.960
 even without markings on anything goes 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:56.460
 shuffle them enough can give in hand 

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:58.619
 of the viewer including 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:04.320
 shuffle if you want and if it 

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:07.049
 want to show that there are none of the 

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:09.390
 first letters right really none 

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:11.650
 here and there is none of the latest 

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:14.200
 letters ok 

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:16.540
 This is not the trick of the cheat deck . 

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:19.299
 You're not manipulating or anything. 

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:20.950
 Move it, they'll continue now. 

00:02:19.299 --> 00:02:24.370
 done it does not do the following I'll get it 

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:27.040
 the paraná in that right position here that 

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:30.430
 I'll just lay a hand on him where he is. 

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:33.959
 exactly a letter that is exactly the 

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:36.430
 previously chosen letter 

00:02:33.959 --> 00:02:39.280
 Good people, let's go another tank with one 

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:42.849
 single deck I'll get you the 

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:44.620
 four aces that have to deck and show 

00:02:42.849 --> 00:02:48.510
 To you that they are friends. 

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:52.900
 inseparable from their infancy 

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:56.889
 You need to understand why I'm just going now. 

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:59.200
 do the following I'll get these here 

00:02:56.889 --> 00:03:02.220
 and I'll separate them in the pack 

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:04.780
 ok separated as follows only 

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:05.620
 each one in a part here of the 

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:09.420
 pack 

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:09.420
 they want to win and even stop 

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:20.669
 for themselves can prove that they 

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:23.799
 are the bread inseparable friends that ok alone 

00:03:20.669 --> 00:03:26.829
 Separate beauty that each one a part 

00:03:23.799 --> 00:03:31.470
 or insert the separate places 

00:03:26.829 --> 00:03:35.019
 ok boats nothing was downloaded more 

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:37.629
 of that scramble awakens you 

00:03:35.019 --> 00:03:39.280
 again this part can give the deck 

00:03:37.629 --> 00:03:41.229
 viewer's hand to stop him 

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:44.109
 coke as the spectator does not have 

00:03:41.229 --> 00:03:46.829
 I'll do it myself then obviously 

00:03:44.109 --> 00:03:49.629
 deck was choked well can cut 

00:03:46.829 --> 00:03:52.060
 do as you please 

00:03:49.629 --> 00:03:53.500
 Beauty done what I'll do I'll 

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:55.299
 hold a pack of 

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:58.260
 way here the paper that has an attack 

00:03:55.299 --> 00:04:00.819
 low will come back to get out of here 

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:03.340
 the better it gets cooler 

00:04:00.819 --> 00:04:06.459
 So here I know that I will hold 

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:11.650
 way pass it again and we have here 

00:04:06.459 --> 00:04:15.389
 exactly four booklets that are the 

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:17.980
 our inseparable friends 

00:04:15.389 --> 00:04:20.380
 This is the bisotê deck in my opinion. 

00:04:17.980 --> 00:04:22.570
 Barzotto is very cool because the trick 

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:23.500
 it is imperceptible to the teacher and 

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:25.480
 researcher 

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:27.580
 so really he can take the hand he 

00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:29.350
 You can examine how much he wants it. 

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:32.650
 You can scramble over the touches 

00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:34.389
 you will not realize exactly what you have to 

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:36.160
 especially that deck I know I 

00:04:34.389 --> 00:04:38.169
 always praises the products that I am 

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:40.300
 showing you here up to this point 

00:04:38.169 --> 00:04:43.030
 of the channel but the videos I made up 

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:45.639
 now is to get to show magic that the 

00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:47.260
 I think it's easy to perform 

00:04:45.639 --> 00:04:48.760
 I'm not a professional magician. There are people. 

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:50.950
 Who already asked that for me but I? 

00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:52.810
 really do magic just for robot or 

00:04:50.950 --> 00:04:54.280
 I usually go out on the street to do magic and 

00:04:52.810 --> 00:04:56.260
 so consequently I myself have 

00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:57.940
 a lot of trouble when you bought one that 

00:04:56.260 --> 00:05:00.010
 it's very difficult to execute 

00:04:57.940 --> 00:05:01.479
 in the case of single cards such as 

00:05:00.010 --> 00:05:02.320
 Most of the videos I showed here 

00:05:01.479 --> 00:05:05.110
 in the channel 

00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:07.360
 it is easy to do the same but 

00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:09.280
 so I understand the easy magic that already 

00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:12.100
 I showed here on the channel so compare 

00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:13.900
 bisotê and also the difficult magic that 

00:05:12.100 --> 00:05:16.590
 I'll show you along the videos 

00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:21.070
 they need a lot of training before they 

00:05:16.590 --> 00:05:24.460
 new package they need a lot 

00:05:21.070 --> 00:05:26.200
 and executed because it makes a difference 

00:05:24.460 --> 00:05:28.060
 I'm talking this may seem like a mean 

00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:30.370
 Obvious but I'm a guy, for example. 

00:05:28.060 --> 00:05:33.340
 very stubborn that I want to buy magic 

00:05:30.370 --> 00:05:35.710
 I already did and I already freaked out 

00:05:33.340 --> 00:05:38.410
 because of that, I also tread 

00:05:35.710 --> 00:05:40.570
 realize that if you stop and get a 

00:05:38.410 --> 00:05:42.250
 time served a little for 

00:05:40.570 --> 00:05:44.470
 keep training a little to hold your 

00:05:42.250 --> 00:05:46.210
 anxiety is a much better message 

00:05:44.470 --> 00:05:47.110
 then it is worth training worth 

00:05:46.210 --> 00:05:49.750
 hold on a little anxiety 

00:05:47.110 --> 00:05:51.370
 really because in the end you're going 

00:05:49.750 --> 00:05:53.680
 perform in a way that you feel 

00:05:51.370 --> 00:05:55.479
 The more comfortable the change is to leave more 

00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:58.030
 perfect viewer will be more 

00:05:55.479 --> 00:05:59.889
 impressed then you train a lot 

00:05:58.030 --> 00:06:01.210
 It will be worth it I'm sure 

00:05:59.889 --> 00:06:02.860
 you will not regret having 

00:06:01.210 --> 00:06:07.479
 spent a little more time 

00:06:02.860 --> 00:06:09.250
 to train and now let's go to the price of 

00:06:07.479 --> 00:06:11.050
 deck voted as if they could see the 

00:06:09.250 --> 00:06:12.789
 Video my deck already have down with 

00:06:11.050 --> 00:06:14.710
 he because he is very old was a 

00:06:12.789 --> 00:06:17.410
 of the first brands I bought this 

00:06:14.710 --> 00:06:20.430
 baradei 2007 then make six years that the 

00:06:17.410 --> 00:06:22.960
 time and it really is a deck that 

00:06:20.430 --> 00:06:25.150
 it lasted a lot in my hand but anyway 

00:06:22.960 --> 00:06:27.160
 Come back our price will not solve 

00:06:25.150 --> 00:06:29.680
 is not expensive and should cost around 20 

00:06:27.160 --> 00:06:32.260
 and a few reais 30 at the most 

00:06:29.680 --> 00:06:34.030
 is already low with the same and you can 

00:06:32.260 --> 00:06:36.010
 choose between red and blue colors 

00:06:34.030 --> 00:06:38.110
 in most of the shops around 

00:06:36.010 --> 00:06:40.840
 books showing various logs 

00:06:38.110 --> 00:06:42.550
 I've shown only a few 

00:06:40.840 --> 00:06:44.500
 here also if the video does not 

00:06:42.550 --> 00:06:46.420
 It's very time-consuming, I think that's it. 

00:06:44.500 --> 00:06:47.920
 that she thinks I understood a little bit 

00:06:46.420 --> 00:06:50.320
 I left in the video a little over a year 

00:06:47.920 --> 00:06:51.940
 As I said more than the ordinary 

00:06:50.320 --> 00:06:53.830
 I wanted to clarify a few things 

00:06:51.940 --> 00:06:55.840
 that I remembered throughout my 

00:06:53.830 --> 00:06:57.460
 I started to get away from the subject a little 

00:06:55.840 --> 00:06:59.320
 so if you have any questions 

00:06:57.460 --> 00:07:00.880
