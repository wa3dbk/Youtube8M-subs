a group of farmers have sort of realized

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:03.649 
a group of farmers have sort of realized
that<00:00:02.490> we've<00:00:02.669> got<00:00:02.850> to<00:00:02.970> do<00:00:03.120> something<00:00:03.510> different

00:00:03.649 --> 00:00:03.659 
that we've got to do something different

00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:06.410 
that we've got to do something different
we<00:00:04.230> can't<00:00:04.529> go<00:00:04.710> on<00:00:04.740> the<00:00:05.549> way<00:00:05.580> we've<00:00:05.940> been<00:00:05.970> going

00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:06.420 
we can't go on the way we've been going

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:08.030 
we can't go on the way we've been going
on<00:00:06.569> depleting<00:00:07.109> our<00:00:07.200> soils

00:00:08.030 --> 00:00:08.040 
on depleting our soils

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:14.089 
on depleting our soils
I<00:00:11.240> was<00:00:12.240> farming<00:00:12.719> and<00:00:12.870> all<00:00:13.200> I<00:00:13.230> was<00:00:13.559> ever<00:00:13.710> worried

00:00:14.089 --> 00:00:14.099 
I was farming and all I was ever worried

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:17.029 
I was farming and all I was ever worried
about<00:00:14.309> was<00:00:14.519> the<00:00:14.670> animals<00:00:15.320> and<00:00:16.320> I<00:00:16.500> never<00:00:16.680> looked

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:17.039 
about was the animals and I never looked

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:19.130 
about was the animals and I never looked
at<00:00:17.190> the<00:00:17.279> ground<00:00:17.490> none<00:00:17.970> of<00:00:18.090> my<00:00:18.270> forefathers

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:19.140 
at the ground none of my forefathers

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:21.560 
at the ground none of my forefathers
ever<00:00:19.320> told<00:00:19.590> me<00:00:19.710> to<00:00:20.670> look<00:00:20.850> at<00:00:21.000> the<00:00:21.090> ground<00:00:21.330> and

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:21.570 
ever told me to look at the ground and

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:24.370 
ever told me to look at the ground and
see<00:00:21.689> what's<00:00:21.900> going<00:00:22.140> on<00:00:22.260> there

00:00:24.370 --> 00:00:24.380 
see what's going on there

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:28.730 
see what's going on there
it's<00:00:25.380> a<00:00:25.699> system<00:00:26.699> of<00:00:26.820> moving<00:00:27.029> cattle<00:00:27.740> quite

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:28.740 
it's a system of moving cattle quite

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:31.700 
it's a system of moving cattle quite
frequently<00:00:29.250> but<00:00:29.849> getting<00:00:30.710> animal

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:31.710 
frequently but getting animal

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:33.560 
frequently but getting animal
interaction<00:00:32.460> with<00:00:32.610> the<00:00:32.669> soil<00:00:32.910> getting<00:00:33.270> but

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:33.570 
interaction with the soil getting but

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:35.150 
interaction with the soil getting but
getting<00:00:33.780> a<00:00:33.840> bit<00:00:33.960> of<00:00:34.050> trampling<00:00:34.380> going<00:00:34.710> which

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:35.160 
getting a bit of trampling going which

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:37.240 
getting a bit of trampling going which
is<00:00:35.190> helping<00:00:35.760> stimulate<00:00:36.000> the<00:00:36.540> the<00:00:36.989> soil

00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:37.250 
is helping stimulate the the soil

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:39.530 
is helping stimulate the the soil
increasing<00:00:38.250> the<00:00:38.340> soil<00:00:38.550> soil<00:00:39.000> microbial

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:39.540 
increasing the soil soil microbial

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:42.560 
increasing the soil soil microbial
activity<00:00:40.079> and<00:00:40.850> just<00:00:41.850> basically<00:00:42.239> getting<00:00:42.450> a

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570 
activity and just basically getting a

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:48.410 
activity and just basically getting a
healthier<00:00:42.899> soil<00:00:46.940> currently<00:00:47.940> what<00:00:48.120> we've<00:00:48.270> done

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
healthier soil currently what we've done

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:50.209 
healthier soil currently what we've done
is<00:00:48.629> have<00:00:48.809> a<00:00:48.840> few<00:00:49.200> animals<00:00:49.620> just<00:00:49.829> slightly

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219 
is have a few animals just slightly

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:51.830 
is have a few animals just slightly
spread<00:00:50.670> over<00:00:50.789> the<00:00:51.000> ground<00:00:51.239> thinking<00:00:51.690> that

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:51.840 
spread over the ground thinking that

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:53.810 
spread over the ground thinking that
that's<00:00:51.960> going<00:00:52.230> to<00:00:52.289> be<00:00:52.440> good<00:00:52.620> for<00:00:52.800> the<00:00:52.920> land<00:00:53.160> but

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820 
that's going to be good for the land but

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:56.180 
that's going to be good for the land but
what<00:00:54.000> happens<00:00:54.480> is<00:00:54.660> the<00:00:54.840> plants<00:00:55.350> that<00:00:55.559> are<00:00:55.710> that

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
what happens is the plants that are that

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:58.389 
what happens is the plants that are that
are<00:00:56.460> desirable<00:00:57.030> never<00:00:57.449> get<00:00:57.690> a<00:00:57.719> rest<00:00:58.050> from

00:00:58.389 --> 00:00:58.399 
are desirable never get a rest from

00:00:58.399 --> 00:01:05.270 
are desirable never get a rest from
being<00:00:59.399> clipped<00:00:59.699> and<00:00:59.910> re<00:01:00.059> clipped<00:01:04.129> what<00:01:05.129> we're

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280 
being clipped and re clipped what we're

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:08.359 
being clipped and re clipped what we're
doing<00:01:05.670> is<00:01:06.170> trying<00:01:07.170> to<00:01:07.290> use<00:01:07.470> the<00:01:07.650> animals<00:01:08.130> and

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:08.369 
doing is trying to use the animals and

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:11.690 
doing is trying to use the animals and
their<00:01:08.580> impacts<00:01:09.680> not<00:01:10.680> only<00:01:10.740> in<00:01:11.070> what<00:01:11.280> they<00:01:11.460> eat

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
their impacts not only in what they eat

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:13.399 
their impacts not only in what they eat
but<00:01:11.909> what<00:01:12.060> they're<00:01:12.270> trampling<00:01:12.900> to<00:01:13.170> get

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:13.409 
but what they're trampling to get

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:16.490 
but what they're trampling to get
basically<00:01:14.159> to<00:01:14.490> get<00:01:15.020> whatever<00:01:16.020> doesn't<00:01:16.259> go

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
basically to get whatever doesn't go

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:17.929 
basically to get whatever doesn't go
through<00:01:16.680> their<00:01:16.860> belly<00:01:17.070> into<00:01:17.490> the<00:01:17.670> Earth's

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:17.939 
through their belly into the Earth's

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:22.130 
through their belly into the Earth's
belly<00:01:18.360> and<00:01:19.040> and<00:01:20.270> then<00:01:21.270> we're<00:01:21.479> trying<00:01:21.750> to<00:01:21.869> allow

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
belly and and then we're trying to allow

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:30.800 
belly and and then we're trying to allow
that<00:01:23.630> that<00:01:24.630> contact<00:01:26.240> to<00:01:28.369> feed<00:01:29.369> the<00:01:29.549> earth<00:01:29.810> help

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810 
that that contact to feed the earth help

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:33.050 
that that contact to feed the earth help
capture<00:01:31.350> the<00:01:31.500> water<00:01:31.740> by<00:01:32.189> having<00:01:32.400> litter<00:01:32.850> on

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
capture the water by having litter on

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:35.780 
capture the water by having litter on
the<00:01:33.090> ground<00:01:33.320> and<00:01:34.320> hold<00:01:34.619> the<00:01:34.770> water<00:01:34.950> in<00:01:35.100> by

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:35.790 
the ground and hold the water in by

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:37.460 
the ground and hold the water in by
protecting<00:01:36.390> it<00:01:36.420> from<00:01:36.540> the<00:01:36.630> sunlight<00:01:36.990> or

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:37.470 
protecting it from the sunlight or

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:40.490 
protecting it from the sunlight or
protecting<00:01:37.979> it<00:01:38.070> from<00:01:38.159> the<00:01:38.250> wind<00:01:38.549> and<00:01:39.140> then<00:01:40.140> get

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
protecting it from the wind and then get

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:42.200 
protecting it from the wind and then get
the<00:01:40.650> animals<00:01:41.040> to<00:01:41.130> a<00:01:41.280> different<00:01:41.700> place<00:01:41.909> so<00:01:41.939> that

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.210 
the animals to a different place so that

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:43.969 
the animals to a different place so that
this<00:01:42.509> place<00:01:42.689> has<00:01:43.020> plenty<00:01:43.320> of<00:01:43.439> time<00:01:43.590> to<00:01:43.619> rest

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:43.979 
this place has plenty of time to rest

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:46.520 
this place has plenty of time to rest
and<00:01:44.310> digest<00:01:44.399> its<00:01:45.299> meal<00:01:45.570> so<00:01:45.869> to<00:01:45.930> speak<00:01:46.259> and

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.530 
and digest its meal so to speak and

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:49.460 
and digest its meal so to speak and
recover<00:01:47.070> from<00:01:47.310> that<00:01:47.549> activity<00:01:48.180> and<00:01:48.420> so<00:01:49.320> we've

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:49.470 
recover from that activity and so we've

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:50.539 
recover from that activity and so we've
been<00:01:49.619> looking<00:01:49.799> at<00:01:49.950> a<00:01:50.040> system<00:01:50.159> where<00:01:50.369> I'll<00:01:50.460> be

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:50.549 
been looking at a system where I'll be

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:52.249 
been looking at a system where I'll be
moving<00:01:50.880> the<00:01:50.939> cattle<00:01:51.270> everyday<00:01:51.630> running<00:01:52.049> them

00:01:52.249 --> 00:01:52.259 
moving the cattle everyday running them

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:54.469 
moving the cattle everyday running them
there's<00:01:52.470> quite<00:01:52.649> a<00:01:52.680> large<00:01:52.890> group<00:01:53.040> and<00:01:53.520> leaving

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:54.479 
there's quite a large group and leaving

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:56.270 
there's quite a large group and leaving
what<00:01:54.630> appears<00:01:54.990> to<00:01:55.170> be<00:01:55.320> quite<00:01:55.590> a<00:01:55.710> lot<00:01:55.920> of<00:01:55.979> growth

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:56.280 
what appears to be quite a lot of growth

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:57.830 
what appears to be quite a lot of growth
and<00:01:56.670> some<00:01:57.000> people<00:01:57.210> might<00:01:57.299> consider<00:01:57.630> it<00:01:57.750> a

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 
and some people might consider it a

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:00.020 
and some people might consider it a
waste<00:01:58.189> but<00:01:59.189> I've<00:01:59.280> been<00:01:59.460> moving<00:01:59.640> the<00:01:59.759> animals

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:00.030 
waste but I've been moving the animals

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:01.670 
waste but I've been moving the animals
which<00:02:00.149> gives<00:02:00.360> the<00:02:00.479> grass<00:02:00.719> time<00:02:01.170> to<00:02:01.350> recover

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:01.680 
which gives the grass time to recover

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:06.499 
which gives the grass time to recover
and<00:02:02.390> and<00:02:03.390> to<00:02:03.750> to<00:02:04.680> grow<00:02:04.890> again<00:02:05.329> replenish<00:02:06.329> quite

00:02:06.499 --> 00:02:06.509 
and and to to grow again replenish quite

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:07.980 
and and to to grow again replenish quite
quickly<00:02:06.780> I've

00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:07.990 
quickly I've

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:12.600 
quickly I've
I've<00:02:08.979> cut<00:02:09.280> my<00:02:10.260> mineral<00:02:11.260> consumption<00:02:12.100> by<00:02:12.580> about

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:12.610 
I've cut my mineral consumption by about

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:15.690 
I've cut my mineral consumption by about
almost<00:02:13.330> 90%<00:02:13.690> from<00:02:14.290> when<00:02:14.440> I<00:02:14.470> first<00:02:14.709> started<00:02:15.160> the

almost 90% from when I first started the

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:17.400 
almost 90% from when I first started the
land<00:02:15.940> is<00:02:16.120> getting<00:02:16.240> healthier<00:02:16.810> with<00:02:16.959> a<00:02:16.990> deeper

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:19.780 
root system and the roots are going

root system and the roots are going
deeper<00:02:20.020> and<00:02:20.200> they're<00:02:20.350> storing<00:02:20.709> more<00:02:20.950> carbon

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:21.490

and that is definitely working with
nature<00:02:43.150> because<00:02:43.660> I<00:02:43.690> would<00:02:43.900> defy<00:02:44.200> any

man is kind of been everywhere we have

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:50.280 
man is kind of been everywhere we have
an<00:03:47.590> expanding<00:03:48.100> population<00:03:48.930> and<00:03:49.930> we<00:03:50.110> have

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:50.290 
an expanding population and we have

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:53.940 
an expanding population and we have
reduced<00:03:51.150> natural<00:03:52.150> capital<00:03:52.900> so<00:03:53.079> to<00:03:53.140> speak<00:03:53.470> soil

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:53.950 
reduced natural capital so to speak soil

00:03:53.950 --> 00:03:59.250 
reduced natural capital so to speak soil
and<00:03:54.310> so<00:03:55.269> now<00:03:57.180> we<00:03:58.180> are<00:03:58.359> going<00:03:58.540> to<00:03:58.630> become<00:03:58.810> more

00:03:59.250 --> 00:03:59.260 
and so now we are going to become more

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:01.470 
and so now we are going to become more
and<00:03:59.320> more<00:03:59.500> responsible<00:04:00.310> for<00:04:00.579> not<00:04:01.060> only<00:04:01.209> what

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:01.480 
and more responsible for not only what

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:03.780 
and more responsible for not only what
we<00:04:01.630> take<00:04:01.959> out<00:04:02.170> but<00:04:02.829> how<00:04:03.040> much<00:04:03.220> are<00:04:03.430> we<00:04:03.549> putting

we take out but how much are we putting

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:06.539 
we take out but how much are we putting

back in all I'm doing is managing chaos
I'm<00:04:06.850> just<00:04:07.180> working<00:04:07.450> with<00:04:07.720> nature<00:04:07.959> and<00:04:08.290> that
