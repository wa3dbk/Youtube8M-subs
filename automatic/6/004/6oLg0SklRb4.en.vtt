00:02:11.089 --> 00:02:11.099 
the water but it also gives fish that

the water but it also gives fish that
are<00:02:11.220> going<00:02:11.310> to<00:02:11.370> come<00:02:11.549> up<00:02:11.610> and<00:02:11.970> strike<00:02:12.239> at<00:02:12.420> the

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:12.540 
are going to come up and strike at the

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:15.140 
are going to come up and strike at the
bait<00:02:12.720> a<00:02:12.900> lot<00:02:13.200> more<00:02:13.410> to<00:02:13.530> hold<00:02:13.709> on<00:02:13.920> to<00:02:14.160> other<00:02:14.670> than

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:15.150 
bait a lot more to hold on to other than

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:17.089 
bait a lot more to hold on to other than
the<00:02:15.299> hooks<00:02:15.540> a<00:02:15.870> lot<00:02:16.349> of<00:02:16.500> the<00:02:16.560> times<00:02:16.799> I<00:02:16.920> get<00:02:17.069> a

00:02:17.089 --> 00:02:17.099 
the hooks a lot of the times I get a

00:02:17.099 --> 00:02:19.180 
the hooks a lot of the times I get a
hold<00:02:17.280> of<00:02:17.340> those<00:02:17.459> legs<00:02:17.730> pull<00:02:18.090> that<00:02:18.269> frog<00:02:18.569> down

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:19.190 
hold of those legs pull that frog down

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:21.500 
hold of those legs pull that frog down
when<00:02:20.190> you<00:02:20.310> said<00:02:20.580> obviously<00:02:20.970> you<00:02:21.090> never<00:02:21.209> have<00:02:21.450> a

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:21.510 
when you said obviously you never have a

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:23.870 
when you said obviously you never have a
chance<00:02:21.750> so<00:02:22.590> the<00:02:22.709> first<00:02:22.920> thing<00:02:23.130> I<00:02:23.250> do<00:02:23.310> is<00:02:23.549> I<00:02:23.640> trim

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:23.880 
chance so the first thing I do is I trim

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:25.250 
chance so the first thing I do is I trim
up<00:02:24.000> the<00:02:24.150> legs<00:02:24.360> I<00:02:24.569> mean<00:02:24.599> you<00:02:24.810> can<00:02:24.930> see<00:02:25.110> the

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:25.260 
up the legs I mean you can see the

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:27.770 
up the legs I mean you can see the
difference<00:02:25.590> I<00:02:25.709> cut<00:02:25.920> them<00:02:26.010> pretty<00:02:26.310> short<00:02:26.780> it's

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:27.780 
difference I cut them pretty short it's

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:29.630 
difference I cut them pretty short it's
like<00:02:27.989> that<00:02:28.200> with<00:02:28.349> all<00:02:28.530> my<00:02:28.680> frogs<00:02:28.950> they're<00:02:29.459> all

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:29.640 
like that with all my frogs they're all

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:33.110 
like that with all my frogs they're all
short<00:02:30.650> that's<00:02:31.650> going<00:02:31.980> to<00:02:32.040> help<00:02:32.340> you<00:02:32.549> get<00:02:32.880> those

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:33.120 
short that's going to help you get those

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:35.990 
short that's going to help you get those
fish<00:02:33.650> instead<00:02:34.650> of<00:02:34.920> targeting<00:02:35.430> back<00:02:35.640> in<00:02:35.910> the

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:36.000 
fish instead of targeting back in the

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.449 
fish instead of targeting back in the
back<00:02:36.209> they<00:02:37.110> don't<00:02:37.260> have<00:02:37.560> as<00:02:37.739> much<00:02:37.950> back<00:02:38.220> here

00:02:38.449 --> 00:02:38.459 
back they don't have as much back here

00:02:38.459 --> 00:02:39.949 
back they don't have as much back here
to<00:02:38.579> bite<00:02:38.790> so<00:02:39.060> when<00:02:39.180> they<00:02:39.299> come<00:02:39.510> up<00:02:39.660> they<00:02:39.810> have<00:02:39.930> a

00:02:39.949 --> 00:02:39.959 
to bite so when they come up they have a

00:02:39.959 --> 00:02:42.650 
to bite so when they come up they have a
tendency<00:02:40.290> to<00:02:40.590> get<00:02:40.829> the<00:02:41.459> whole<00:02:41.700> frog<00:02:42.060> instead

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:42.660 
tendency to get the whole frog instead

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:45.500 
tendency to get the whole frog instead
of<00:02:42.750> just<00:02:43.019> the<00:02:43.140> legs<00:02:43.579> the<00:02:44.579> second<00:02:45.120> thing<00:02:45.329> that<00:02:45.360> I

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:45.510 
of just the legs the second thing that I

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:48.440 
of just the legs the second thing that I
do<00:02:45.630> and<00:02:46.019> this<00:02:46.410> is<00:02:46.620> by<00:02:46.890> far<00:02:46.920> the<00:02:47.370> most<00:02:47.790> important

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:48.450 
do and this is by far the most important

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:52.309 
do and this is by far the most important
for<00:02:49.049> anybody<00:02:49.470> fishing<00:02:49.769> a<00:02:50.040> frog<00:02:50.370> is<00:02:51.019> when<00:02:52.019> frogs

00:02:52.309 --> 00:02:52.319 
for anybody fishing a frog is when frogs

00:02:52.319 --> 00:02:54.170 
for anybody fishing a frog is when frogs
are<00:02:52.560> designed<00:02:52.950> they're<00:02:53.519> designed<00:02:53.970> to<00:02:54.090> be

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:54.180 
are designed they're designed to be

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:56.390 
are designed they're designed to be
weedless<00:02:54.720> right<00:02:55.049> most<00:02:55.319> people<00:02:55.590> fish<00:02:56.010> them<00:02:56.160> on

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:56.400 
weedless right most people fish them on

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:59.090 
weedless right most people fish them on
mats<00:02:56.730> I<00:02:57.380> generally<00:02:58.380> don't<00:02:58.530> I<00:02:58.709> fish<00:02:58.950> them

00:02:59.090 --> 00:02:59.100 
mats I generally don't I fish them

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:01.099 
mats I generally don't I fish them
around<00:02:59.310> grass<00:02:59.670> a<00:02:59.700> lot<00:03:00.090> but<00:03:00.389> I<00:03:00.420> also<00:03:00.600> fish<00:03:00.959> them

00:03:01.099 --> 00:03:01.109 
around grass a lot but I also fish them

00:03:01.109 --> 00:03:05.059 
around grass a lot but I also fish them
in<00:03:01.200> open<00:03:01.470> water<00:03:01.790> but<00:03:02.790> it's<00:03:02.940> critical<00:03:03.799> to<00:03:04.799> deal

00:03:05.059 --> 00:03:05.069 
in open water but it's critical to deal

00:03:05.069 --> 00:03:06.920 
in open water but it's critical to deal
with<00:03:05.370> these<00:03:05.579> hooks<00:03:05.940> because<00:03:06.600> when<00:03:06.780> they're

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:06.930 
with these hooks because when they're

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:09.140 
with these hooks because when they're
designed<00:03:07.260> to<00:03:07.319> be<00:03:07.410> weedless<00:03:08.150> that's

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:09.150 
designed to be weedless that's

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:12.349 
designed to be weedless that's
inherently<00:03:09.900> going<00:03:10.290> to<00:03:10.470> miss<00:03:10.889> some<00:03:11.130> fish<00:03:11.370> so

00:03:12.349 --> 00:03:12.359 
inherently going to miss some fish so

00:03:12.359 --> 00:03:15.170 
inherently going to miss some fish so
what<00:03:12.810> I'll<00:03:12.930> do<00:03:13.170> is<00:03:13.410> I<00:03:14.340> take<00:03:14.549> that<00:03:14.609> hook<00:03:14.970> that's

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:15.180 
what I'll do is I take that hook that's

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:16.670 
what I'll do is I take that hook that's
a<00:03:15.329> stalk<00:03:15.630> up<00:03:15.900> hopefully<00:03:16.139> you<00:03:16.350> can<00:03:16.470> see<00:03:16.650> that

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:16.680 
a stalk up hopefully you can see that

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:19.069 
a stalk up hopefully you can see that
this<00:03:16.950> is<00:03:17.130> the<00:03:17.280> spittin<00:03:17.700> wall<00:03:17.910> and<00:03:18.209> I<00:03:18.750> talked

00:03:19.069 --> 00:03:19.079 
this is the spittin wall and I talked

00:03:19.079 --> 00:03:20.539 
this is the spittin wall and I talked
about<00:03:19.230> showing<00:03:19.620> you<00:03:19.829> guys<00:03:19.950> how<00:03:20.010> to<00:03:20.220> modify

00:03:20.539 --> 00:03:20.549 
about showing you guys how to modify

00:03:20.549 --> 00:03:23.479 
about showing you guys how to modify
this<00:03:20.730> frog<00:03:21.090> like<00:03:21.420> a<00:03:21.690> year<00:03:22.530> ago<00:03:22.799> and<00:03:23.040> never<00:03:23.250> got

00:03:23.479 --> 00:03:23.489 
this frog like a year ago and never got

00:03:23.489 --> 00:03:26.930 
this frog like a year ago and never got
around<00:03:23.519> to<00:03:23.910> it<00:03:24.150> so<00:03:24.359> this<00:03:25.049> is<00:03:25.290> one<00:03:25.530> that<00:03:26.280> stalk

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:26.940 
around to it so this is one that stalk

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:30.020 
around to it so this is one that stalk
this<00:03:27.630> is<00:03:27.900> one<00:03:28.109> that<00:03:28.290> I've<00:03:28.380> modified<00:03:29.000> now<00:03:30.000> I

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:30.030 
this is one that I've modified now I

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:31.309 
this is one that I've modified now I
don't<00:03:30.269> know<00:03:30.359> if<00:03:30.450> you<00:03:30.569> guys<00:03:30.690> can<00:03:30.959> see<00:03:31.170> the

00:03:31.309 --> 00:03:31.319 
don't know if you guys can see the

00:03:31.319 --> 00:03:33.949 
don't know if you guys can see the
differences<00:03:31.799> or<00:03:31.980> not<00:03:32.180> but<00:03:33.180> basically<00:03:33.660> what<00:03:33.930> I

00:03:33.949 --> 00:03:33.959 
differences or not but basically what I

00:03:33.959 --> 00:03:37.039 
differences or not but basically what I
do<00:03:34.280> is<00:03:35.280> I'll<00:03:35.489> take<00:03:35.519> my<00:03:35.730> hooks<00:03:36.209> which<00:03:36.750> you<00:03:36.870> can

00:03:37.039 --> 00:03:37.049 
do is I'll take my hooks which you can

00:03:37.049 --> 00:03:39.620 
do is I'll take my hooks which you can
see<00:03:37.290> are<00:03:37.500> tipped<00:03:38.190> in<00:03:38.400> and<00:03:38.849> they're<00:03:39.480> also

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:39.630 
see are tipped in and they're also

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:42.979 
see are tipped in and they're also
tipped<00:03:40.139> down<00:03:40.639> into<00:03:41.639> the<00:03:41.849> body<00:03:42.060> helps<00:03:42.660> it<00:03:42.870> be

00:03:42.979 --> 00:03:42.989 
tipped down into the body helps it be

00:03:42.989 --> 00:03:46.309 
tipped down into the body helps it be
more<00:03:43.200> weedless<00:03:43.560> I<00:03:43.910> tip<00:03:44.910> them<00:03:45.120> slightly<00:03:45.540> up<00:03:45.900> and

00:03:46.309 --> 00:03:46.319 
more weedless I tip them slightly up and

00:03:46.319 --> 00:03:50.960 
more weedless I tip them slightly up and
then<00:03:47.310> I<00:03:47.340> tip<00:03:47.700> them<00:03:47.970> out<00:03:48.209> a<00:03:48.810> lot<00:03:49.680> and<00:03:50.040> I<00:03:50.700> do<00:03:50.760> it

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:50.970 
then I tip them out a lot and I do it

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:52.510 
then I tip them out a lot and I do it
with<00:03:51.090> all<00:03:51.269> my<00:03:51.299> frogs

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:52.520 
with all my frogs

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:57.070 
with all my frogs
so<00:03:53.060> what<00:03:53.270> you'll<00:03:53.450> see<00:03:53.540> is<00:03:54.200> that<00:03:55.780> most<00:03:56.780> frogs

00:03:57.070 --> 00:03:57.080 
so what you'll see is that most frogs

00:03:57.080 --> 00:03:58.420 
so what you'll see is that most frogs
when<00:03:57.290> they<00:03:57.380> come<00:03:57.530> out<00:03:57.620> of<00:03:57.770> the<00:03:57.860> package<00:03:58.250> have

00:03:58.420 --> 00:03:58.430 
when they come out of the package have

00:03:58.430 --> 00:04:01.800 
when they come out of the package have
that<00:03:58.580> tip<00:03:58.880> in<00:03:59.120> I<00:04:00.100> don't<00:04:01.100> completely

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:01.810 
that tip in I don't completely

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:04.930 
that tip in I don't completely
straighten<00:04:02.810> them<00:04:02.900> out<00:04:03.370> but<00:04:04.370> I<00:04:04.400> bend<00:04:04.700> them<00:04:04.820> out

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:04.940 
straighten them out but I bend them out

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:07.800 
straighten them out but I bend them out
quite<00:04:05.660> a<00:04:05.690> ways<00:04:06.160> almost<00:04:07.160> to<00:04:07.370> where<00:04:07.520> they're

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:07.810 
quite a ways almost to where they're

00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:10.240 
quite a ways almost to where they're
they're<00:04:08.810> out<00:04:08.960> parallel<00:04:09.500> to<00:04:09.920> each<00:04:10.070> other

00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:10.250 
they're out parallel to each other

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:12.700 
they're out parallel to each other
instead<00:04:10.760> of<00:04:10.820> kicked<00:04:11.240> way<00:04:11.480> in<00:04:11.690> like<00:04:11.960> an<00:04:12.080> e<00:04:12.200> WG

00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:12.710 
instead of kicked way in like an e WG

00:04:12.710 --> 00:04:15.430 
instead of kicked way in like an e WG
style<00:04:12.980> hook<00:04:13.220> they're<00:04:13.850> more<00:04:14.150> parallel<00:04:14.750> what

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:15.440 
style hook they're more parallel what

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:19.390 
style hook they're more parallel what
that's<00:04:15.650> going<00:04:15.920> to<00:04:16.070> do<00:04:16.370> is<00:04:17.320> allow<00:04:18.320> that<00:04:18.650> hook<00:04:19.040> to

00:04:19.390 --> 00:04:19.400 
that's going to do is allow that hook to

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:24.370 
that's going to do is allow that hook to
be<00:04:19.760> exposed<00:04:21.340> much<00:04:22.340> sooner<00:04:22.760> so<00:04:23.480> a<00:04:23.510> stock<00:04:23.990> bait

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:24.380 
be exposed much sooner so a stock bait

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:28.090 
be exposed much sooner so a stock bait
has<00:04:25.100> to<00:04:25.400> be<00:04:25.550> very<00:04:25.910> very<00:04:26.120> compressed<00:04:26.900> and<00:04:27.320> the

00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:28.100 
has to be very very compressed and the

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:30.420 
has to be very very compressed and the
fish<00:04:28.280> has<00:04:28.490> to<00:04:28.640> have<00:04:28.760> it<00:04:28.940> fully<00:04:29.180> engulfed

00:04:30.420 --> 00:04:30.430 
fish has to have it fully engulfed

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:33.880 
fish has to have it fully engulfed
before<00:04:31.430> you've<00:04:31.670> got<00:04:31.820> hook<00:04:32.120> exposure<00:04:32.890> once

00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:33.890 
before you've got hook exposure once

00:04:33.890 --> 00:04:36.670 
before you've got hook exposure once
they're<00:04:34.130> bent<00:04:34.430> out<00:04:34.840> all<00:04:35.840> they<00:04:36.200> have<00:04:36.320> to<00:04:36.470> do<00:04:36.560> is

00:04:36.670 --> 00:04:36.680 
they're bent out all they have to do is

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:39.820 
they're bent out all they have to do is
touch<00:04:36.920> that<00:04:37.220> thing<00:04:37.460> either<00:04:38.330> way<00:04:38.540> and<00:04:39.020> they've

00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:39.830 
touch that thing either way and they've

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:42.940 
touch that thing either way and they've
got<00:04:40.070> hook<00:04:40.280> exposure<00:04:41.350> that's<00:04:42.350> going<00:04:42.680> to<00:04:42.770> put

00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:42.950 
got hook exposure that's going to put

00:04:42.950 --> 00:04:45.550 
got hook exposure that's going to put
more<00:04:43.100> fish<00:04:43.310> in<00:04:43.520> the<00:04:43.610> boat<00:04:43.760> for<00:04:43.790> you<00:04:44.560> obviously

00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:45.560 
more fish in the boat for you obviously

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:47.920 
more fish in the boat for you obviously
you<00:04:46.040> want<00:04:46.280> your<00:04:46.430> frog<00:04:46.670> to<00:04:46.820> be<00:04:46.940> weedless<00:04:47.330> so<00:04:47.870> you

00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:47.930
