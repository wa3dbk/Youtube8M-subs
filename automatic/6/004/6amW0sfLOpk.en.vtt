sort of the the granddaddy's again you

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:02.090 
sort of the the granddaddy's again you
want<00:00:59.190> something<00:00:59.520> solid<00:00:59.780> now<00:01:00.780> because<00:01:01.530> of<00:01:01.710> the

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100 
want something solid now because of the

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:04.429 
want something solid now because of the
angle<00:01:02.609> of<00:01:02.760> your<00:01:03.030> hand<00:01:03.420> you're<00:01:03.899> going<00:01:04.110> to<00:01:04.229> want

angle of your hand you're going to want

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:06.649 
angle of your hand you're going to want
to<00:01:04.559> probably<00:01:05.280> bend<00:01:05.670> the<00:01:05.880> picks<00:01:06.090> a<00:01:06.240> little<00:01:06.479> bit

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659 
to probably bend the picks a little bit

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:09.320 
to probably bend the picks a little bit
especially<00:01:07.080> the<00:01:07.830> middle<00:01:08.549> finger<00:01:08.939> here

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
especially the middle finger here

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:11.450 
especially the middle finger here
because<00:01:09.869> your<00:01:10.140> hand<00:01:10.350> is<00:01:10.500> is<00:01:10.710> going<00:01:11.010> to<00:01:11.100> be<00:01:11.220> sort

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
because your hand is is going to be sort

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:14.630 
because your hand is is going to be sort
of<00:01:11.520> crooked<00:01:12.030> like<00:01:12.659> this<00:01:12.930> and<00:01:13.170> but<00:01:14.100> the<00:01:14.250> ideal

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
of crooked like this and but the ideal

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:17.030 
of crooked like this and but the ideal
attack<00:01:15.119> for<00:01:15.450> the<00:01:15.479> pick<00:01:15.750> is<00:01:16.200> as<00:01:16.380> much<00:01:16.590> straight

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
attack for the pick is as much straight

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:19.070 
attack for the pick is as much straight
on<00:01:17.220> as<00:01:17.400> possible<00:01:17.970> so<00:01:18.270> since<00:01:18.509> your<00:01:18.720> hand<00:01:18.930> is<00:01:19.049> not

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.080 
on as possible so since your hand is not

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:21.260 
on as possible so since your hand is not
actually<00:01:19.860> coming<00:01:20.189> at<00:01:20.280> a<00:01:20.310> straight-on<00:01:20.670> angle

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
actually coming at a straight-on angle

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:24.550 
actually coming at a straight-on angle
probably<00:01:21.930> want<00:01:22.140> to<00:01:22.200> bend<00:01:22.500> this<00:01:22.740> slightly<00:01:23.159> over

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:24.560 
probably want to bend this slightly over

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:29.300 
probably want to bend this slightly over
toward<00:01:25.560> this<00:01:26.040> way<00:01:26.310> to<00:01:26.909> accommodate<00:01:28.070> so<00:01:29.070> as<00:01:29.130> to

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
toward this way to accommodate so as to

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:31.940 
toward this way to accommodate so as to
have<00:01:29.549> the<00:01:29.759> pick<00:01:29.939> be<00:01:30.210> aligned<00:01:30.659> it<00:01:31.049> as<00:01:31.650> straight

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
have the pick be aligned it as straight

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:33.980 
have the pick be aligned it as straight
as<00:01:32.130> possible<00:01:32.159> as<00:01:32.729> you<00:01:32.759> can<00:01:32.880> this<00:01:33.630> applies<00:01:33.960> to

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990 
as possible as you can this applies to

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:35.870 
as possible as you can this applies to
to<00:01:34.500> really<00:01:34.890> everything<00:01:35.340> you're<00:01:35.460> gonna<00:01:35.579> do

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
to really everything you're gonna do

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:38.060 
to really everything you're gonna do
with<00:01:36.090> a<00:01:36.150> thumb<00:01:36.479> again<00:01:37.079> a<00:01:37.259> straight<00:01:37.619> an<00:01:37.770> attack

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:38.070 
with a thumb again a straight an attack

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:39.649 
with a thumb again a straight an attack
as<00:01:38.280> possible<00:01:38.820> it's<00:01:38.970> going<00:01:39.090> to<00:01:39.150> produce<00:01:39.360> a

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:39.659 
as possible it's going to produce a

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:42.560 
as possible it's going to produce a
better<00:01:39.840> sound<00:01:40.200> clean<00:01:40.740> even<00:01:41.430> strike<00:01:41.759> thumb

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:42.570 
better sound clean even strike thumb

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:45.200 
better sound clean even strike thumb
picks<00:01:42.780> very<00:01:43.140> subjective<00:01:43.470> I<00:01:44.040> prefer<00:01:44.729> a<00:01:44.759> lighter

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210 
picks very subjective I prefer a lighter

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:47.120 
picks very subjective I prefer a lighter
one<00:01:45.479> you<00:01:45.930> can<00:01:46.140> get<00:01:46.320> all<00:01:46.500> sorts<00:01:46.979> of<00:01:47.070> different

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
one you can get all sorts of different

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:49.460 
one you can get all sorts of different
kinds<00:01:47.610> some<00:01:47.909> of<00:01:48.030> them<00:01:48.149> are<00:01:48.270> much<00:01:48.420> heavier<00:01:48.750> that

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:49.470 
kinds some of them are much heavier that

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:51.649 
kinds some of them are much heavier that
they<00:01:49.710> sort<00:01:49.890> of<00:01:49.979> a<00:01:50.399> good<00:01:50.759> class<00:01:51.180> barrier<00:01:51.509> your

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:51.659 
they sort of a good class barrier your

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:54.050 
they sort of a good class barrier your
your<00:01:51.960> thumb<00:01:52.259> with<00:01:52.500> more<00:01:52.979> grip<00:01:53.520> and<00:01:53.790> there's

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.060 
your thumb with more grip and there's

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:56.630 
your thumb with more grip and there's
just<00:01:54.600> more<00:01:54.630> plastic<00:01:55.409> maybe<00:01:55.950> that's<00:01:56.250> what<00:01:56.520> you

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
just more plastic maybe that's what you

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:59.179 
just more plastic maybe that's what you
like<00:01:56.880> I<00:01:57.119> found<00:01:57.570> that<00:01:57.899> after<00:01:58.079> a<00:01:58.290> while<00:01:58.469> it<00:01:58.979> was<00:01:59.159> a

00:01:59.179 --> 00:01:59.189 
like I found that after a while it was a

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:01.910 
like I found that after a while it was a
little<00:01:59.509> unwieldy<00:02:00.509> and<00:02:00.990> that<00:02:01.350> a<00:02:01.380> lighter<00:02:01.619> pick

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:01.920 
little unwieldy and that a lighter pick
