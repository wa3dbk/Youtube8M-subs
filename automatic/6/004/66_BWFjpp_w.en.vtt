the<00:03:09.660> characteristics<00:03:10.350> of<00:03:10.440> this<00:03:10.560> hockey<00:03:10.800> club

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:11.100 
the characteristics of this hockey club

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:13.100 
the characteristics of this hockey club
describe<00:03:11.490> them<00:03:11.640> for<00:03:11.670> us<00:03:11.940> well<00:03:12.540> I<00:03:12.600> think<00:03:12.810> that

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:13.110 
describe them for us well I think that

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:15.470 
describe them for us well I think that
we're<00:03:13.560> a<00:03:13.590> relatively<00:03:14.010> young<00:03:14.310> club<00:03:14.640> with<00:03:14.850> with

we're a relatively young club with with

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:16.850 
we're a relatively young club with with
good<00:03:15.690> seniors<00:03:16.020> and<00:03:16.200> I<00:03:16.230> think<00:03:16.410> we've<00:03:16.530> gained<00:03:16.770> a

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:16.860 
good seniors and I think we've gained a

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:18.110 
good seniors and I think we've gained a
lot<00:03:16.980> of<00:03:17.070> poise<00:03:17.250> the<00:03:17.430> last<00:03:17.640> half<00:03:17.820> the<00:03:17.940> season

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:18.120 
lot of poise the last half the season

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:20.090 
lot of poise the last half the season
we're<00:03:18.390> not<00:03:18.510> taking<00:03:18.900> the<00:03:19.050> as<00:03:19.560> many<00:03:19.680> stupid

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:20.100 
we're not taking the as many stupid

we're not taking the as many stupid
penalties<00:03:20.330> we're<00:03:21.330> playing<00:03:21.570> with<00:03:21.690> good<00:03:21.900> poise

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:22.140 
penalties we're playing with good poise

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:23.210

whether we're ahead or whether we're
behind<00:03:23.550> and<00:03:23.820> I<00:03:24.120> think<00:03:24.660> that<00:03:24.780> we're<00:03:24.930> beginning

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:25.620
