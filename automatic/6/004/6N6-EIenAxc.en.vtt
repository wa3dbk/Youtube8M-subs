00:00:31.419 --> 00:00:37.100
 personal hello okay this natural 

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:40.010
 week is a super simple makeup and 

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:42.379
 Stylish is easy to make 

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:45.680
 the main charm is in the eyeliner 

00:00:42.379 --> 00:00:47.150
 red lipstick is also a highlight and if 

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:49.250
 You do not like red lipstick, do you? 

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:50.420
 You can replace last and will also 

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:52.550
 stay super handsome 

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:55.150
 so let's go there step by step and I hope 

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:55.150
 that you like 

00:00:56.840 --> 00:01:02.670
 so I start applying the collective in 

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:07.500
 the entire eyelid to make the action 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:08.850
 for grude and that with the most intense color 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:11.850
 since I'm going to work with a shadow 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:14.820
 well clear then apply the concealer 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:21.390
 in every eyelid that I go 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:23.700
 use of natura watercolor and now with 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:26.039
 this palette of a grass is a 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:28.289
 customizable reed has her review on the 

00:01:26.039 --> 00:01:30.570
 blog then if you still do not know gives 

00:01:28.289 --> 00:01:33.869
 One glance there the shadows are super 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:37.170
 segmented and I'm still riding my 

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:40.140
 palette actually and I chose a tone of 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:44.340
 champagne to pass all over the bank 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:47.340
 the brush is very chubby 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:51.509
 so he gets enough of his own product 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:53.310
 paste the net that my eyebrow is 

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:56.299
 she has a slight flicker that goes 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:56.299
 stay super handsome 

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:06.310
 now with a medium brown tone 

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:09.070
 eggplant I'll apply everything with cable is 

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:10.570
 I wanted to put a little bit of horn 

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:13.270
 with the car to escape the brown 

00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:15.460
 traditional but if you still prefer 

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:17.920
 a clothes you can wear that goes 

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:21.780
 to be super cute is also what I wanted 

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:21.780
 give a different touch on makeup 

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:27.040
 already that simple makeup, then I 

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:31.000
 wanted to put a different color in the 

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:32.800
 concave there with the smoking brush 

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:36.700
 only this is a little more dot dinho 

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:39.040
 then it applies more precisely and the 

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:41.740
 informed 

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:42.760
 if you do not put too much pressure 

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:44.890
 brush 

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:49.150
 so I 'm going to make a move of vai 

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:51.370
 seeing you I'm already used to it 

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:54.940
 Concentrate this color well there on coconut bamboo 

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:57.880
 and go up just a little now with a tone 

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:59.170
 beige is a super satiny kiss 

00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:01.150
 handsome too he has a slight 

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:03.510
 Complication twitching throughout eyelid 

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:03.510
 mobile 

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:10.989
 The cool thing about this makeup besides them is 

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:13.360
 super simple and quick to do so if 

00:03:10.989 --> 00:03:15.159
 You have little time and you play this game. 

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:17.019
 Makeup that she will be perfect 

00:03:15.159 --> 00:03:19.230
 for a party mainly was 

00:03:17.019 --> 00:03:19.230
 morning 

00:03:23.489 --> 00:03:28.900
 now I have returned to using the eyeliner in 

00:03:26.019 --> 00:03:30.250
 gel to do the outline but you can 

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:32.500
 use the liquid 

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:33.670
 finally you took prefer can 

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:35.409
 until the weiss 

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:38.019
 if you do not have much skill with 

00:03:35.409 --> 00:03:41.379
 video eyeliner here on the channel 

00:03:38.019 --> 00:03:43.599
 teaching to apply eyeliner then gives 

00:03:41.379 --> 00:03:45.970
 A little glance too if you still do not 

00:03:43.599 --> 00:03:48.819
 is very familiar with one with this 

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:51.489
 type of product but the makeup 

00:03:48.819 --> 00:03:53.379
 no doubt is the outline and in this case I 

00:03:51.489 --> 00:03:56.230
 I pulled the trigger but you too. 

00:03:53.379 --> 00:03:59.730
 can make his walks more blurred than 

00:03:56.230 --> 00:03:59.730
 It will get super stylish too. 

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:12.030
 lower eyelashes I chose not to 

00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:15.569
 put no shadow till new pencil 

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:19.109
 beige is the intention is really a 

00:04:15.569 --> 00:04:22.049
 simple practice and makeup quickie and 

00:04:19.109 --> 00:04:24.480
 so do not weigh so much just to 

00:04:22.049 --> 00:04:25.590
 you can use one at the event during the 

00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:27.120
 day 

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:31.290
 so when I used a 

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:33.300
 low shade but this is at the discretion 

00:04:31.290 --> 00:04:36.360
 of you like it you can apply 

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:39.690
 black pencil too and of course it's like 

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:43.770
 Simple makeup I never left the 

00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:46.260
 put the circus chi chuan and pt such esse 

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:48.440
 is a very nice pillar model of my 

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:48.440
 store 

00:04:48.810 --> 00:04:53.820
 I applied the speech of the uterus to dry 

00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:57.150
 then I am applying this pencil beige 

00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:59.510
 here said berenice particularly the 

00:04:57.150 --> 00:04:59.510
 my favorite 

00:05:02.729 --> 00:05:09.509
 and there will reign to top with mask 

00:05:05.610 --> 00:05:11.610
 eyelashes to that hen when they are 

00:05:09.509 --> 00:05:14.849
 it is transparent but it is important 

00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:17.759
 such as passing an eyeliner on top just to 

00:05:14.849 --> 00:05:20.039
 ensure that there is no difference 

00:05:17.759 --> 00:05:22.319
 outlined in the know so I always like 

00:05:20.039 --> 00:05:24.889
 to return with eyeliner over the 

00:05:22.319 --> 00:05:24.889
 hill 

00:05:40.849 --> 00:05:45.979
 This is the result of skin makeup 

00:05:43.159 --> 00:05:48.860
 is also very light to us with the 

00:05:45.979 --> 00:05:50.779
 outline and the blush well marked as I 

00:05:48.860 --> 00:05:53.779
 I like this, I particularly think 

00:05:50.779 --> 00:05:55.849
 beautiful is that illuminator that is the 

00:05:53.779 --> 00:06:01.009
 the nec author of shopping that is my 

00:05:55.849 --> 00:06:03.499
 preferred and in the mouth is the ballet of dairj 

00:06:01.009 --> 00:06:05.659
 mixed with a sneaker made a 

00:06:03.499 --> 00:06:07.610
 misturinha of course I was more 

00:06:05.659 --> 00:06:08.990
 the ballet than the shoe I have 

00:06:07.610 --> 00:06:11.179
 a certain difficulty because of the 

00:06:08.990 --> 00:06:12.770
