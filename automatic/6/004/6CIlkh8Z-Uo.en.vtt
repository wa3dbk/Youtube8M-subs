prefer<00:03:20.310> a<00:03:20.549> brush<00:03:21.209> to<00:03:21.419> me<00:03:21.540> just<00:03:21.810> goes<00:03:21.959> on<00:03:22.109> faster

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:22.680 
prefer a brush to me just goes on faster

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:25.159 
prefer a brush to me just goes on faster
and<00:03:22.859> is<00:03:22.949> a<00:03:22.980> lot<00:03:23.190> easier<00:03:23.220> now<00:03:24.150> I<00:03:24.359> used<00:03:24.720> a<00:03:24.930> sample

00:03:25.159 --> 00:03:25.169 
and is a lot easier now I used a sample

00:03:25.169 --> 00:03:27.949 
and is a lot easier now I used a sample
sized<00:03:25.680> jar<00:03:26.069> of<00:03:26.250> wax<00:03:26.519> I've<00:03:27.299> used<00:03:27.599> this<00:03:27.720> one

00:03:27.949 --> 00:03:27.959 
sized jar of wax I've used this one

00:03:27.959 --> 00:03:30.170 
sized jar of wax I've used this one
sample<00:03:28.349> size<00:03:28.709> on<00:03:28.980> many<00:03:29.459> many<00:03:29.699> pieces<00:03:30.030> of

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:30.180 
sample size on many many pieces of

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:32.930 
sample size on many many pieces of
furniture<00:03:30.480> so<00:03:31.379> a<00:03:31.409> little<00:03:31.739> wax<00:03:32.069> goes<00:03:32.459> a<00:03:32.519> long

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:32.940 
furniture so a little wax goes a long

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:36.920 
furniture so a little wax goes a long
long<00:03:33.750> way<00:03:34.129> go<00:03:35.129> ahead<00:03:35.459> and<00:03:35.790> brush<00:03:36.120> or<00:03:36.449> rub<00:03:36.750> in

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:36.930 
long way go ahead and brush or rub in

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:38.479 
long way go ahead and brush or rub in
your<00:03:36.959> wax<00:03:37.349> it's<00:03:37.709> your<00:03:37.859> choice

00:03:38.479 --> 00:03:38.489 
your wax it's your choice

00:03:38.489 --> 00:03:40.729 
your wax it's your choice
and<00:03:38.579> do<00:03:39.299> it<00:03:39.449> to<00:03:39.540> your<00:03:39.659> whole<00:03:39.810> piece<00:03:40.079> just<00:03:40.530> make

00:03:40.729 --> 00:03:40.739 
and do it to your whole piece just make

00:03:40.739 --> 00:03:44.210 
and do it to your whole piece just make
sure<00:03:40.949> you<00:03:41.069> seal<00:03:41.430> in<00:03:41.699> that<00:03:41.970> paint<00:03:42.560> I<00:03:43.560> even<00:03:44.069> did

00:03:44.210 --> 00:03:44.220 
sure you seal in that paint I even did

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:45.979 
sure you seal in that paint I even did
it<00:03:44.250> on<00:03:44.370> the<00:03:44.489> tabletop<00:03:44.879> even<00:03:45.479> though<00:03:45.629> I'm<00:03:45.840> going

00:03:45.979 --> 00:03:45.989 
it on the tabletop even though I'm going

00:03:45.989 --> 00:03:48.170 
it on the tabletop even though I'm going
to<00:03:46.139> decoupage<00:03:46.500> the<00:03:46.889> tabletop<00:03:47.400> so<00:03:47.909> it<00:03:47.970> just

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:48.180 
to decoupage the tabletop so it just

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:49.879 
to decoupage the tabletop so it just
felt<00:03:48.389> like<00:03:48.449> it<00:03:48.569> sealed<00:03:49.139> it<00:03:49.319> in<00:03:49.440> a<00:03:49.530> little<00:03:49.769> bit

00:03:49.879 --> 00:03:49.889 
felt like it sealed it in a little bit

00:03:49.889 --> 00:03:52.309 
felt like it sealed it in a little bit
more<00:03:50.069> now<00:03:50.790> once<00:03:51.060> your<00:03:51.239> piece<00:03:51.389> cures<00:03:51.810> for<00:03:52.079> a<00:03:52.139> day

00:03:52.309 --> 00:03:52.319 
more now once your piece cures for a day

00:03:52.319 --> 00:03:55.009 
more now once your piece cures for a day
or<00:03:52.470> two<00:03:52.500> it's<00:03:52.859> time<00:03:53.099> for<00:03:53.340> the<00:03:53.400> montaging<00:03:54.150> now<00:03:54.810> I

00:03:55.009 --> 00:03:55.019 
or two it's time for the montaging now I

00:03:55.019 --> 00:03:57.559 
or two it's time for the montaging now I
chose<00:03:55.500> a<00:03:55.639> Disneyland<00:03:56.639> theme<00:03:56.940> because<00:03:57.359> my

00:03:57.559 --> 00:03:57.569 
chose a Disneyland theme because my

00:03:57.569 --> 00:04:00.289 
chose a Disneyland theme because my
sister-in-law<00:03:58.409> loves<00:03:59.159> Disneyland<00:03:59.699> she<00:04:00.150> goes

00:04:00.289 --> 00:04:00.299 
sister-in-law loves Disneyland she goes

00:04:00.299 --> 00:04:03.080 
sister-in-law loves Disneyland she goes
all<00:04:00.540> the<00:04:00.599> time<00:04:01.379> so<00:04:01.979> I<00:04:02.040> felt<00:04:02.340> like<00:04:02.489> this<00:04:02.609> is<00:04:02.819> very

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:03.090 
all the time so I felt like this is very

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:05.839 
all the time so I felt like this is very
appropriate<00:04:03.449> for<00:04:04.109> her<00:04:04.260> I<00:04:04.500> found<00:04:05.190> an<00:04:05.400> old<00:04:05.579> book

00:04:05.839 --> 00:04:05.849 
appropriate for her I found an old book

00:04:05.849 --> 00:04:08.270 
appropriate for her I found an old book
and<00:04:06.030> I<00:04:06.150> cut<00:04:06.359> it<00:04:06.449> up<00:04:06.569> and<00:04:06.870> the<00:04:07.379> hardest<00:04:07.769> part<00:04:07.859> is

00:04:08.270 --> 00:04:08.280 
and I cut it up and the hardest part is

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:10.759 
and I cut it up and the hardest part is
figuring<00:04:08.760> out<00:04:09.090> the<00:04:09.239> placement<00:04:09.479> so<00:04:10.440> once<00:04:10.620> you

00:04:10.759 --> 00:04:10.769 
figuring out the placement so once you

00:04:10.769 --> 00:04:12.500 
figuring out the placement so once you
get<00:04:10.889> that<00:04:11.069> all<00:04:11.250> figured<00:04:11.609> out<00:04:11.729> it's<00:04:11.970> time<00:04:12.239> for

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:12.510 
get that all figured out it's time for

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:15.469 
get that all figured out it's time for
the<00:04:12.599> Mod<00:04:12.780> Podge<00:04:13.190> now<00:04:14.190> I<00:04:14.220> am<00:04:14.639> NOT<00:04:14.849> a<00:04:14.879> pro<00:04:15.239> at

00:04:15.469 --> 00:04:15.479 
the Mod Podge now I am NOT a pro at

00:04:15.479 --> 00:04:17.330 
the Mod Podge now I am NOT a pro at
decoupaging<00:04:16.109> and<00:04:16.500> there<00:04:16.590> may<00:04:16.739> be<00:04:16.769> an<00:04:17.099> easier

00:04:17.330 --> 00:04:17.340 
decoupaging and there may be an easier

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:19.909 
decoupaging and there may be an easier
way<00:04:17.880> of<00:04:17.909> doing<00:04:18.120> it<00:04:18.570> and<00:04:18.810> if<00:04:19.019> so<00:04:19.260> let<00:04:19.680> me<00:04:19.799> know

00:04:19.909 --> 00:04:19.919 
way of doing it and if so let me know

00:04:19.919 --> 00:04:21.979 
way of doing it and if so let me know

these paper I lay its out flat and after

00:04:31.169 --> 00:04:33.050 
these paper I lay its out flat and after
some<00:04:31.379> trial<00:04:31.650> and<00:04:31.800> error<00:04:31.979> I<00:04:32.280> found<00:04:32.610> out<00:04:32.849> that

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:33.060 
some trial and error I found out that

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:35.420 
some trial and error I found out that
using<00:04:33.479> a<00:04:33.599> credit<00:04:33.930> card<00:04:34.289> to<00:04:34.740> smooth<00:04:35.099> it<00:04:35.250> all<00:04:35.400> out

00:04:35.420 --> 00:04:35.430 
using a credit card to smooth it all out

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:37.700 
using a credit card to smooth it all out
takes<00:04:36.330> all<00:04:36.479> the<00:04:36.599> bubbles<00:04:36.870> out<00:04:36.990> and<00:04:37.050> makes<00:04:37.530> it

00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:37.710 
takes all the bubbles out and makes it

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:40.850 
takes all the bubbles out and makes it
just<00:04:37.860> look<00:04:38.759> even<00:04:39.090> better<00:04:39.210> so<00:04:40.199> after<00:04:40.590> you<00:04:40.710> do

00:04:40.850 --> 00:04:40.860 
just look even better so after you do

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:43.850 
just look even better so after you do
this<00:04:41.069> after<00:04:41.490> repeating<00:04:42.330> it<00:04:42.509> several<00:04:43.289> hundred

00:04:43.850 --> 00:04:43.860 
this after repeating it several hundred

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:45.619 
this after repeating it several hundred
times<00:04:44.039> or<00:04:44.310> however<00:04:44.520> many<00:04:44.849> pictures<00:04:45.300> you<00:04:45.330> have

00:04:45.619 --> 00:04:45.629 
times or however many pictures you have

00:04:45.629 --> 00:04:48.350 
times or however many pictures you have
your<00:04:46.379> project<00:04:46.830> turns<00:04:47.069> out<00:04:47.250> like<00:04:47.460> this<00:04:47.699> I<00:04:48.000> think

00:04:48.350 --> 00:04:48.360 
your project turns out like this I think

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:50.450 
your project turns out like this I think
it<00:04:48.629> came<00:04:48.780> out<00:04:48.840> really<00:04:49.289> really<00:04:49.439> cute<00:04:49.949> and<00:04:50.219> I

00:04:54.140 --> 00:04:54.150 
love it and I want one now so to seal in

00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:56.240 
love it and I want one now so to seal in
your<00:04:54.330> project<00:04:54.840> you<00:04:54.960> use<00:04:55.110> the<00:04:55.319> Mod<00:04:55.500> Podge<00:04:55.800> again

00:04:56.240 --> 00:04:56.250 
your project you use the Mod Podge again

00:04:56.250 --> 00:04:59.629 
your project you use the Mod Podge again
I<00:04:56.659> used<00:04:57.659> a<00:04:57.810> foam<00:04:58.020> brush<00:04:58.229> and<00:04:58.620> just<00:04:58.830> brush<00:04:59.159> the

00:04:59.629 --> 00:04:59.639 
I used a foam brush and just brush the

00:04:59.639 --> 00:05:02.119 
I used a foam brush and just brush the
glue<00:05:00.000> on<00:05:00.180> there<00:05:00.419> like<00:05:00.629> it<00:05:00.810> was<00:05:00.930> paint<00:05:01.169> dries

00:05:02.119 --> 00:05:02.129 
glue on there like it was paint dries

00:05:02.129 --> 00:05:04.730 
glue on there like it was paint dries
really<00:05:02.400> fast<00:05:02.539> it<00:05:03.539> seals<00:05:03.900> it<00:05:04.139> in<00:05:04.259> and<00:05:04.500> it<00:05:04.590> gives

00:05:04.730 --> 00:05:04.740 
really fast it seals it in and it gives

00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:07.100
