00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:08.290
 hello sophy in this video I 

00:00:06.790 --> 00:00:10.570
 would like to show you how to make up 

00:00:08.290 --> 00:00:13.750
 a pretty princess crown with 

00:00:10.570 --> 00:00:15.400
 precious stones and flowers I do 

00:00:13.750 --> 00:00:17.470
 first three pairs of small 

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:19.720
 points that will allow me to determine 

00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:22.779
 the top and the bottom of each stone 

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:24.580
 valuable that allows me to make sure 

00:00:22.779 --> 00:00:27.250
 that their size is adapted to the shape 

00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:29.189
 of the face and that they are positioned 

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:32.379
 well and metric way 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:35.260
 I now form 3 rounded rhombus 

00:00:32.379 --> 00:00:38.350
 on the sides by joining each loses 

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:39.579
 two points by a thin line I 

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:41.679
 then covers completely 

00:00:39.579 --> 00:00:44.050
 the inside of the lozenges with a 

00:00:41.679 --> 00:00:45.639
 light purple color if you do not 

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:48.129
 not this color you can everything 

00:00:45.639 --> 00:00:50.710
 just mixed a little rape with 

00:00:48.129 --> 00:00:52.719
 white to get it also note 

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:55.780
 currently I'm using a small 

00:00:52.719 --> 00:00:57.249
 round brush of the size number 3 in 

00:00:55.780 --> 00:00:59.920
 pushing a little more on my brush 

00:00:57.249 --> 00:01:02.079
 to get a thicker line jean 

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:04.080
 circle now every diamond with 

00:01:02.079 --> 00:01:07.000
 a golden color 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:09.580
 some golden makeup have a 

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:12.070
 rather fine consistency which gives a 

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:13.600
 made quite transparent on the skin in 

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:14.440
 this case you can first applied 

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:16.000
 a first layer 

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:18.160
 let it dry a little while and 

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:22.180
 apply a second coat over 

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:24.460
 to get a very good view 

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:27.220
 I now read the gemstone 

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:31.140
 from the middle with the other two in 

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:33.180
 forming a kind of small rounded bridge 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:35.440
 sorry for the lack of visibility 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:37.479
 I still hope that you can 

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:40.390
 see through my hair that I am 

00:01:37.479 --> 00:01:43.090
 doing a line in the form of 

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:45.640
 u between the two eyes that I extend from 

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:48.280
 each side following the shape of 

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:51.700
 diamond located above and that I 

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:53.710
 ends with a hook after doing 

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:56.560
 exactly the same on the other side 

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:59.290
 I position my brush just at 

00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:01.840
 above the hook and I trace a long 

00:01:59.290 --> 00:02:04.869
 slightly rounded line to the 

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:06.310
 hair birth over this 

00:02:04.869 --> 00:02:09.100
 line I'm doing another now 

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:11.200
 hook in the opposite direction to 

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:14.290
 the one I had already done and 

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:16.750
 I'm rounding the angles I have now 

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:19.770
 finished with the golden color and that's it 

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:22.840
 what the crown looks like at this stage 

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:24.940
 to give relief it is necessary now 

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:28.090
 put shadows I start with the 

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:30.519
 shadows on the golden color always 

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:33.340
 with my brush in number 3 is a 

00:02:30.519 --> 00:02:36.730
 dark brown color that I apply from 

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:39.640
 very light and superficial way only 

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:42.250
 not too dark and weigh down their looks 

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:44.709
 makeup to determine the 

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:47.860
 correct placement of the shadows think 

00:02:44.709 --> 00:02:49.959
 always where does the light come from in this 

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:52.480
 case the light comes from the top 

00:02:49.959 --> 00:02:55.360
 shadows will be placed always underneath 

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:57.280
 of a specific line or form and 

00:02:55.360 --> 00:03:00.610
 especially remember that the route of 

00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:02.080
 shadows must be subtle and light you 

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:04.330
 can to possibly degrade 

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:06.130
 use the fingertip or the tip 

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:06.670
 of your brush if this one is enough 

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:09.700
 dry 

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:12.040
 I now take a pink color 

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:15.280
 metallic and I add three pearls 

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:18.610
 round to the crown for flowers 

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:20.829
 I add 3 oval shape enough 

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:23.920
 irregular on the temples of each 

00:03:20.829 --> 00:03:25.720
 side of the face the flora of the middle being 

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:28.570
 slightly larger than both 

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:30.850
 others for more depth and 

00:03:28.570 --> 00:03:34.030
 reliefs game but now a little bit of 

00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:36.550
 dark red on every little pearl 

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:38.590
 rose that I degraded with the end of 

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:40.840
 finger is funny asymmetrical shape 

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:42.880
 does not look like at the moment not at all 

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:45.610
 to small roses but look like 

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:47.890
 it's easy to turn them 

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:50.560
 start by doing a semicircle all 

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:53.800
 upstairs that I am by little 

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:54.840
 rounded lines from the outside 

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:57.220
 towards the inside 

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:59.970
 always alternating right left 

00:03:57.220 --> 00:03:59.970
 right left 

00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:04.580
 I now take a purple color 

00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:06.970
 dark to add shadows to 

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:09.350
 inside each diamond 

00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:11.180
 they must not be made 

00:04:09.350 --> 00:04:13.400
 in an absolutely perfect way is 

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:14.840
 identical because the light is not reflected 

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:15.549
 never really the same on every 

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:18.530
 area 

00:04:15.549 --> 00:04:22.070
 the goal is to create shapes rather 

00:04:18.530 --> 00:04:23.830
 triangular up and down to 

00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:26.600
 inside each diamond 

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:27.860
 in fact it's quite difficult to 

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:29.060
 explain but you see pretty much what 

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:34.160
 that I'm doing on the 

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:35.540
 video and if the contrast between 

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:36.890
 different shades of purple is not 

00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:40.330
 quite supported you can of course 

00:04:36.890 --> 00:04:40.330
 add a second layer 

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:50.220
 the small roses located on the side and 

00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:52.020
 else on the temples are in my opinion 

00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:52.500
 quite optional for this 

00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:55.379
 makeup 

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:57.419
 however, if you want to include them 

00:04:55.379 --> 00:05:00.979
 I advise you to add some 

00:04:57.419 --> 00:05:05.069
 small leaves in light green and dark 

00:05:00.979 --> 00:05:10.139
 to avoid the flowers being too 

00:05:05.069 --> 00:05:11.699
 isolated on each side of the face in desolate 

00:05:10.139 --> 00:05:13.139
 the camera was off 

00:05:11.699 --> 00:05:14.550
 oh that's what I did during this 

00:05:13.139 --> 00:05:16.740
 time there I simply add 

00:05:14.550 --> 00:05:19.060
 two small dots on the top right of 

00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:22.210
 every gemstone 

00:05:19.060 --> 00:05:24.520
 originally I actually wanted to complete 

00:05:22.210 --> 00:05:26.620
 this makeup at this point but it has me 

00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:28.900
 appeared a little bland and a little too clear 

00:05:26.620 --> 00:05:31.139
 so I decided to accentuate the shadows 

00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:33.490
 and add small black lines 

00:05:31.139 --> 00:05:35.320
 I'll admit it was enough 

00:05:33.490 --> 00:05:37.750
 scary because I was afraid of too much 

00:05:35.320 --> 00:05:39.669
 dark all the makeup in the end 

00:05:37.750 --> 00:05:42.340
 counting the final result I liked 

00:05:39.669 --> 00:05:44.680
 so I think it was a good idea 

00:05:42.340 --> 00:05:47.650
 I leave you however the care of 

00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:51.790
 choose to add these little lines 

00:05:47.650 --> 00:05:53.830
 black or not if you decide to 

00:05:51.790 --> 00:05:55.660
 add I advise you to use a 

00:05:53.830 --> 00:05:58.510
 very fine brush of size number one 

00:05:55.660 --> 00:06:00.729
 or number two is to position the 

00:05:58.510 --> 00:06:04.490
 small black lines where the areas 

00:06:00.729 --> 00:06:06.590
 shaded would be the most pronounced 

00:06:04.490 --> 00:06:09.169
 and it's not absolutely necessary 

00:06:06.590 --> 00:06:11.389
 to add these thin black lines on 

00:06:09.169 --> 00:06:13.460
 the set of shaded areas I you 

00:06:11.389 --> 00:06:14.930
 advise from time to time to back off 

00:06:13.460 --> 00:06:17.060
 a few steps and look at the 

00:06:14.930 --> 00:06:18.740
 makeup as a whole what you 

00:06:17.060 --> 00:06:21.650
 will determine where 

00:06:18.740 --> 00:06:25.039
 it is necessary to add more 

00:06:21.650 --> 00:06:26.300
 contrast here is now one of 

00:06:25.039 --> 00:06:28.849
 steps that I appreciate everything 

00:06:26.300 --> 00:06:31.280
 especially add points 

00:06:28.849 --> 00:06:33.530
 whites at the end of the makeup especially in 

00:06:31.280 --> 00:06:35.810
 descending order game positions them 

00:06:33.530 --> 00:06:40.490
 first of all above each diamond 

00:06:35.810 --> 00:06:42.550
 purple then between the two eyes and finally 

00:06:40.490 --> 00:06:44.750
 on each side of the face 

00:06:42.550 --> 00:06:46.789
 this may not be the makeup 

00:06:44.750 --> 00:06:48.110
 that I would do if I make up is a 

00:06:46.789 --> 00:06:50.030
 event and that there was a very 

00:06:48.110 --> 00:06:51.110
 long queues courses for 

00:06:50.030 --> 00:06:52.550
 a girl who invites to a 

00:06:51.110 --> 00:06:54.440
 birthday or who like to dress up 

00:06:52.550 --> 00:06:57.199
 in princess it's certainly all about 

00:06:54.440 --> 00:06:59.840
 made fit I hope you liked it I 

00:06:57.199 --> 00:07:00.979
 thank you for following him and I 

00:06:59.840 --> 00:07:03.520
 wish you a good end of the day 

00:07:00.979 --> 00:07:03.520
 see you soon
