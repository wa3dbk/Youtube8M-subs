00:00:52.219 --> 00:00:53.470

to put the dates in the food processor

00:00:55.370 --> 00:00:56.770

00:00:56.770 --> 00:00:56.780 
because they take a little bit to break

00:00:56.780 --> 00:00:59.290 
because they take a little bit to break
up<00:00:56.960> and<00:00:57.320> I<00:00:58.010> like<00:00:58.399> I<00:00:58.730> know<00:00:58.850> a<00:00:58.969> lot<00:00:59.149> of<00:00:59.210> people

00:00:59.290 --> 00:00:59.300 
up and I like I know a lot of people

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:10.080 
up and I like I know a lot of people
like<00:00:59.719> medjool<00:01:00.170> dates<00:01:00.410> I<00:01:00.649> like<00:01:00.980> the<00:01:01.160> dog

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:10.090 

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:14.190 

and<00:01:10.770> the<00:01:11.770> flavor<00:01:12.070> of<00:01:12.219> the<00:01:12.340> dates<00:01:12.609> is<00:01:13.200> more

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:16.260 
and the flavor of the dates is more
buttery<00:01:14.649> so<00:01:15.100> I<00:01:15.130> think<00:01:15.250> when<00:01:15.670> you're<00:01:15.789> not<00:01:16.000> using

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:16.270 
buttery so I think when you're not using

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:19.139 
buttery so I think when you're not using
dairy<00:01:16.689> in<00:01:16.899> a<00:01:16.990> recipe<00:01:17.289> it's<00:01:18.219> just<00:01:18.579> for<00:01:19.000> me<00:01:19.119> I
