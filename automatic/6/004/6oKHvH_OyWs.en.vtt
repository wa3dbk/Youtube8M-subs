while<00:00:04.420> the<00:00:04.750> page<00:00:04.960> navigation<00:00:05.230> and<00:00:05.980> view<00:00:06.460> is

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:06.700 
while the page navigation and view is

00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:09.060 
while the page navigation and view is
great<00:00:07.359> for<00:00:07.600> simple<00:00:07.810> apps<00:00:08.200> most<00:00:08.500> developers

00:00:09.060 --> 00:00:09.070 
great for simple apps most developers

00:00:09.070 --> 00:00:10.580 
great for simple apps most developers
need<00:00:09.309> a<00:00:09.340> lot<00:00:09.610> more<00:00:09.790> options<00:00:10.000> and<00:00:10.360> features

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:10.590 
need a lot more options and features

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:13.170 
need a lot more options and features
more<00:00:11.590> like<00:00:11.740> the<00:00:11.860> navigation<00:00:12.309> view<00:00:12.730> controller

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:13.180 
more like the navigation view controller

00:00:13.180 --> 00:00:15.990 
more like the navigation view controller
in<00:00:13.480> regular<00:00:14.110> iOS<00:00:14.619> programming<00:00:14.949> and<00:00:15.459> that's

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:16.000 
in regular iOS programming and that's

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.680 
in regular iOS programming and that's
what<00:00:16.209> the<00:00:16.360> hierarchical<00:00:17.020> navigation<00:00:17.350> is<00:00:17.920> for

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:18.690 
what the hierarchical navigation is for

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:21.180 
what the hierarchical navigation is for
so<00:00:19.690> here<00:00:19.900> I<00:00:19.930> have<00:00:20.050> so<00:00:20.680> the<00:00:20.770> first<00:00:20.950> thing<00:00:21.100> I'm

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:21.190 
so here I have so the first thing I'm

00:00:21.190 --> 00:00:22.650 
so here I have so the first thing I'm
going<00:00:21.280> to<00:00:21.340> do<00:00:21.460> is<00:00:21.580> delete<00:00:21.880> this<00:00:22.060> segue<00:00:22.450> and

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:22.660 
going to do is delete this segue and

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:25.440 
going to do is delete this segue and
delete<00:00:23.170> the<00:00:23.290> second<00:00:23.680> view<00:00:23.940> I'm<00:00:24.940> going<00:00:25.180> to<00:00:25.240> drag

00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:25.450 
delete the second view I'm going to drag

00:00:25.450 --> 00:00:31.710 
delete the second view I'm going to drag
in<00:00:25.660> to<00:00:26.110> new<00:00:26.770> interface<00:00:27.700> controllers<00:00:28.380> and<00:00:30.720> two

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:31.720 
in to new interface controllers and two

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:35.900 
in to new interface controllers and two
buttons<00:00:32.520> into<00:00:33.520> our<00:00:33.760> first<00:00:34.210> initial<00:00:35.079> interface

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:35.910 
buttons into our first initial interface

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:41.450 
buttons into our first initial interface
and<00:00:37.560> this<00:00:38.560> is<00:00:38.650> because<00:00:38.980> there's<00:00:39.430> two<00:00:39.880> types<00:00:40.630> of

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
and this is because there's two types of

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:46.319 
and this is because there's two types of
hierarchical<00:00:42.570> segues<00:00:43.680> the<00:00:44.680> first<00:00:45.270> so<00:00:46.270> to

00:00:46.319 --> 00:00:46.329 
hierarchical segues the first so to

00:00:46.329 --> 00:00:49.920 
hierarchical segues the first so to
create<00:00:46.750> a<00:00:47.079> segue<00:00:48.070> between<00:00:48.520> two<00:00:48.910> interfaces<00:00:49.510> we

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:49.930 
create a segue between two interfaces we

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:51.900 
create a segue between two interfaces we
of<00:00:50.110> course<00:00:50.350> control<00:00:50.739> drag<00:00:51.040> from<00:00:51.280> our<00:00:51.520> button

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:51.910 
of course control drag from our button

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:55.229 
of course control drag from our button
to<00:00:52.870> one<00:00:53.530> of<00:00:53.649> our<00:00:53.770> interfaces<00:00:54.130> now<00:00:54.550> the<00:00:54.969> first

00:00:55.229 --> 00:00:55.239 
to one of our interfaces now the first

00:00:55.239 --> 00:01:00.000 
to one of our interfaces now the first
action<00:00:55.870> segue<00:00:56.290> is<00:00:56.680> a<00:00:56.829> push<00:00:57.690> the<00:00:58.690> second<00:00:59.110> is<00:00:59.649> a

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:00.010 
action segue is a push the second is a

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:02.700 
action segue is a push the second is a
modal<00:01:00.730> now<00:01:01.450> if<00:01:01.600> you've<00:01:01.750> done<00:01:02.020> iOS<00:01:02.500> programming

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:02.710 
modal now if you've done iOS programming

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:04.649 
modal now if you've done iOS programming
before<00:01:03.129> you<00:01:03.399> you've<00:01:03.760> probably<00:01:03.969> heard<00:01:04.390> of<00:01:04.509> each

00:01:04.649 --> 00:01:04.659 
before you you've probably heard of each

00:01:04.659 --> 00:01:06.929 
before you you've probably heard of each
piece<00:01:04.960> they<00:01:05.680> work<00:01:05.890> the<00:01:06.130> same<00:01:06.369> way<00:01:06.399> as<00:01:06.670> they<00:01:06.880> do

00:01:06.929 --> 00:01:06.939 
piece they work the same way as they do

00:01:06.939 --> 00:01:09.899 
piece they work the same way as they do
in<00:01:07.180> regular<00:01:07.360> iOS<00:01:07.899> programming<00:01:08.109> and<00:01:08.819> show<00:01:09.819> you

00:01:09.899 --> 00:01:09.909 
in regular iOS programming and show you

00:01:09.909 --> 00:01:11.969 
in regular iOS programming and show you
that<00:01:10.030> I'm<00:01:10.240> going<00:01:10.359> to<00:01:10.389> run<00:01:10.630> the<00:01:10.810> app<00:01:10.929> so<00:01:11.439> here<00:01:11.889> we

00:01:11.969 --> 00:01:11.979 
that I'm going to run the app so here we

00:01:11.979 --> 00:01:14.940 
that I'm going to run the app so here we
have<00:01:12.130> our<00:01:12.310> two<00:01:12.579> buttons<00:01:12.990> the<00:01:13.990> first<00:01:14.020> having<00:01:14.829> a

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:14.950 
have our two buttons the first having a

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:18.090 
have our two buttons the first having a
push<00:01:15.429> segue<00:01:15.909> as<00:01:16.359> you<00:01:17.200> can<00:01:17.289> see<00:01:17.439> just<00:01:17.889> like<00:01:18.069> a

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:18.100

00:01:21.599 --> 00:01:21.609 
regular iOS as you can see it pulls that

00:01:21.609 --> 00:01:24.330 
regular iOS as you can see it pulls that
other<00:01:21.789> interface<00:01:22.240> in<00:01:22.840> from<00:01:23.229> the<00:01:23.319> right<00:01:23.529> like<00:01:24.100> a

can see like a modal view controller on

00:01:43.689 --> 00:01:47.489 
can see like a modal view controller on
iOS<00:01:44.139> it<00:01:44.380> pulls<00:01:45.689> that<00:01:46.689> new<00:01:46.959> interface

00:01:47.489 --> 00:01:47.499 
iOS it pulls that new interface

00:01:47.499 --> 00:01:50.730 
iOS it pulls that new interface
controller<00:01:48.299> over<00:01:49.299> the<00:01:49.419> top<00:01:49.659> of<00:01:49.869> the<00:01:50.469> interface

it<00:02:27.959> just<00:02:27.990> pulls<00:02:28.380> that<00:02:28.620> mode<00:02:28.920> over<00:02:29.640> the<00:02:29.730> top<00:02:29.940> we

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:30.450 
it just pulls that mode over the top we

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:32.690 
it just pulls that mode over the top we
can<00:02:30.660> dismiss<00:02:30.959> it<00:02:31.020> and<00:02:31.800> we<00:02:31.920> can<00:02:32.069> continue<00:02:32.370> to

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:35.250 
navigate between our two screens but our

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:39.260 
navigate between our two screens but our
push<00:02:35.610> button<00:02:36.180> doesn't<00:02:36.690> work<00:02:37.130> it<00:02:38.130> tries<00:02:38.970> to

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:39.270 
push button doesn't work it tries to

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:41.390 
push button doesn't work it tries to
pull<00:02:39.450> that<00:02:39.569> interface<00:02:39.989> over<00:02:40.230> to<00:02:40.410> the<00:02:40.500> side<00:02:40.709> but

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:41.400 
pull that interface over to the side but

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:43.760 
pull that interface over to the side but
it<00:02:41.670> just<00:02:42.300> doesn't<00:02:42.630> do<00:02:42.720> it<00:02:42.750> properly<00:02:43.110> that's

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:43.770 
it just doesn't do it properly that's

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:46.729 
it just doesn't do it properly that's
because<00:02:44.130> you<00:02:44.220> can't<00:02:44.489> use<00:02:44.700> a<00:02:44.730> push<00:02:45.150> segue<00:02:45.930> from

00:02:46.729 --> 00:02:46.739 
because you can't use a push segue from

00:02:46.739 --> 00:02:49.580 
because you can't use a push segue from
a<00:02:47.160> page<00:02:47.880> navigation<00:02:48.570> interface<00:02:49.170> controller

you<00:02:50.400> just<00:02:50.580> can't<00:02:50.820> you<00:02:51.390> can<00:02:51.510> only<00:02:51.720> use<00:02:52.080> modal

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:52.860 
you just can't you can only use modal

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:56.720 
you just can't you can only use modal
segues<00:02:53.580> to<00:02:54.000> pull<00:02:54.540> an<00:02:54.870> interface<00:02:55.650> over<00:02:56.190> the<00:02:56.519> top

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:56.730 
segues to pull an interface over the top

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:04.910 
of the page view so being able to
navigate<00:03:01.650> is<00:03:02.280> a<00:03:02.670> great<00:03:03.120> step<00:03:03.480> forward<00:03:03.930> but<00:03:04.830> the

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:04.920 
navigate is a great step forward but the

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:06.020 
navigate is a great step forward but the
