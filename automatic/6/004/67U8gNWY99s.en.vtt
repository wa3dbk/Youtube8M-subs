starter clutch how the clutch works is
that<00:00:18.390> when<00:00:18.690> I<00:00:18.720> pull<00:00:19.020> the<00:00:19.140> rope<00:00:20.900> it'll<00:00:21.900> it'll

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:22.289 
that when I pull the rope it'll it'll

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:24.710 
that when I pull the rope it'll it'll
grab<00:00:22.650> a<00:00:22.680> hole<00:00:22.920> and<00:00:23.160> spin<00:00:23.460> the<00:00:23.640> engine<00:00:23.699> but<00:00:24.570> then

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:24.720 
grab a hole and spin the engine but then

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:27.240 
when the Rope rewind it spins back in

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:29.419 
when the Rope rewind it spins back in
place<00:00:27.480> so<00:00:27.660> it's<00:00:27.810> a<00:00:27.869> ratcheting<00:00:28.289> action<00:00:28.560> he'll

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:29.429 
place so it's a ratcheting action he'll

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:33.950 
place so it's a ratcheting action he'll
turn<00:00:29.580> one<00:00:29.820> way<00:00:31.009> but<00:00:32.009> not<00:00:32.160> the<00:00:32.340> other<00:00:32.460> and<00:00:32.960> I'm

chisel and a small hammer and let's see

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:46.250 
chisel and a small hammer and let's see
if<00:00:43.680> I<00:00:43.800> can<00:00:43.829> do<00:00:44.040> this<00:00:44.070> on<00:00:44.340> the<00:00:44.399> first<00:00:44.610> try<00:00:45.260> we're

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:46.260 
if I can do this on the first try we're

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:48.250 
if I can do this on the first try we're
going<00:00:46.350> to<00:00:46.440> do<00:00:46.500> a<00:00:46.530> separate<00:00:46.890> these<00:00:47.070> two<00:00:47.129> pieces

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:48.260 
going to do a separate these two pieces

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:57.840 
going to do a separate these two pieces
just<00:00:49.260> tap<00:00:49.440> gently

00:00:57.840 --> 00:00:57.850

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:09.580 

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:12.610 

this<00:01:10.580> part<00:01:10.850> here<00:01:11.060> it<00:01:11.630> will<00:01:11.780> slide<00:01:12.080> off<00:01:12.110> of<00:01:12.290> here

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:12.620 
this part here it will slide off of here

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:15.670 
this part here it will slide off of here
very<00:01:13.370> easily<00:01:14.020> now<00:01:15.020> for<00:01:15.200> the<00:01:15.290> sake<00:01:15.470> of<00:01:15.500> the

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:45.450 
each of the balls and put it in one of
the<00:01:36.110> six<00:01:36.729> slots<00:01:37.900> and<00:01:38.900> this<00:01:39.259> bus<00:01:39.500> to<00:01:39.619> hear

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:45.460 

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:49.230 

now<00:01:46.090> hopefully<00:01:46.720> you<00:01:46.930> can<00:01:47.110> see<00:01:47.350> this<00:01:48.240> what

now hopefully you can see this what

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:52.440 
now hopefully you can see this what
happens<00:01:49.600> is<00:01:49.780> the<00:01:50.200> balls<00:01:50.440> will<00:01:51.100> allow<00:01:51.340> the<00:01:51.450> this

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:52.450 
happens is the balls will allow the this

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:55.230 
happens is the balls will allow the this
part<00:01:52.840> to<00:01:53.200> spin<00:01:53.530> that<00:01:53.710> way<00:01:53.950> but<00:01:54.790> when<00:01:54.909> you<00:01:55.030> spin

00:01:55.230 --> 00:01:55.240 
part to spin that way but when you spin

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:57.510 
part to spin that way but when you spin
it<00:01:55.360> the<00:01:55.390> other<00:01:55.540> way<00:01:55.740> the<00:01:56.740> balls<00:01:56.950> lock<00:01:57.250> it<00:01:57.430> in

00:01:57.510 --> 00:01:57.520 
it the other way the balls lock it in

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:03.770 
it the other way the balls lock it in
place<00:01:57.670> and<00:01:58.140> then<00:01:59.140> one<00:01:59.320> spin<00:01:59.650> what<00:02:00.600> do<00:02:01.600> it<00:02:01.659> again

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:03.780 
place and then one spin what do it again

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:14.840 
place and then one spin what do it again
that<00:02:04.780> in<00:02:04.899> place

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:14.850 

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:18.890 

again<00:02:15.570> it<00:02:16.020> won't<00:02:16.320> it<00:02:16.710> will<00:02:16.800> lock<00:02:17.310> that<00:02:17.580> way<00:02:17.900> but

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:18.900 
again it won't it will lock that way but

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:21.620 
again it won't it will lock that way but
release<00:02:19.260> that<00:02:19.500> way<00:02:20.210> I'm<00:02:21.210> going<00:02:21.330> to<00:02:21.390> take<00:02:21.480> this

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:21.630 
release that way I'm going to take this

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:26.020 
release that way I'm going to take this
piece<00:02:21.720> here<00:02:23.060> slide<00:02:24.060> the<00:02:24.210> back<00:02:24.360> on<00:02:24.570> top<00:02:24.840> there

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:26.030 
piece here slide the back on top there

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:29.540 
piece here slide the back on top there
put<00:02:27.030> your<00:02:27.060> hammer<00:02:27.830> and<00:02:28.830> gently<00:02:29.190> tap<00:02:29.400> it

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:36.000 
together got it back together and again

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.940 
together got it back together and again
turns<00:02:36.810> that<00:02:37.020> way<00:02:37.370> put<00:02:38.370> grabs<00:02:38.610> ahold<00:02:38.760> that<00:02:39.600> way
