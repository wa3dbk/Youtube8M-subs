00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710 
obviously there's not gonna be too many

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:07.070 
obviously there's not gonna be too many
of<00:01:05.070> them<00:01:05.159> on<00:01:05.430> the<00:01:05.610> auction<00:01:05.760> block<00:01:06.060> so<00:01:06.780> he's<00:01:06.930> up

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080

when they're pretty much just initially

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:00.350 
when they're pretty much just initially
looking<00:02:58.739> at<00:02:58.830> him<00:02:58.950> they're<00:02:59.280> very<00:02:59.640> similar<00:03:00.209> but

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:00.360 
looking at him they're very similar but

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:01.910 
looking at him they're very similar but
this<00:03:00.569> way<00:03:00.720> you<00:03:00.780> could<00:03:00.959> obviously<00:03:01.319> dive<00:03:01.680> into

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:01.920 
this way you could obviously dive into

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:03.650 
this way you could obviously dive into
their<00:03:02.100> stats<00:03:02.430> it<00:03:02.760> would<00:03:02.910> just<00:03:03.030> make<00:03:03.209> life<00:03:03.420> so

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:03.660 
their stats it would just make life so

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:05.390 
their stats it would just make life so
much<00:03:03.690> easier<00:03:04.049> and<00:03:04.290> again<00:03:04.590> you<00:03:04.950> wouldn't<00:03:05.190> have

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:05.400 
much easier and again you wouldn't have

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:06.740 
much easier and again you wouldn't have
to<00:03:05.549> own<00:03:05.730> these<00:03:05.910> two<00:03:06.090> cards<00:03:06.390> you<00:03:06.450> can<00:03:06.569> just

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:06.750 
to own these two cards you can just

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:08.270 
to own these two cards you can just
highlight<00:03:06.959> them<00:03:07.290> as<00:03:07.410> long<00:03:07.560> as<00:03:07.739> they're<00:03:07.860> on<00:03:08.040> the

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:08.280 
highlight them as long as they're on the

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:11.059 
highlight them as long as they're on the
same<00:03:08.549> auction<00:03:08.819> block<00:03:09.480> page<00:03:09.840> you<00:03:10.440> could<00:03:10.709> do<00:03:10.890> it

00:03:11.059 --> 00:03:11.069 
same auction block page you could do it

00:03:11.069 --> 00:03:13.580 
same auction block page you could do it
