and<00:03:20.959> then<00:03:21.350> one<00:03:21.590> of<00:03:21.709> our<00:03:21.769> flights<00:03:22.160> had<00:03:22.459> a<00:03:22.489> little

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:22.700 
and then one of our flights had a little

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:25.150 
and then one of our flights had a little
bit<00:03:22.880> of<00:03:22.970> turbulence<00:03:23.209> so<00:03:23.870> I<00:03:24.319> had<00:03:24.769> to<00:03:24.859> take<00:03:24.980> one

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:25.160 
bit of turbulence so I had to take one

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:26.860 
bit of turbulence so I had to take one
of<00:03:25.190> these<00:03:25.340> in<00:03:25.519> the<00:03:25.609> air<00:03:25.730> for<00:03:26.120> that<00:03:26.359> day<00:03:26.569> we<00:03:26.750> got

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:26.870 
of these in the air for that day we got

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:29.199 
of these in the air for that day we got
back<00:03:27.079> and<00:03:27.470> I<00:03:27.650> did<00:03:27.829> take<00:03:28.040> a<00:03:28.069> few<00:03:28.370> on<00:03:28.760> the<00:03:28.940> trip

00:03:29.199 --> 00:03:29.209 
back and I did take a few on the trip

00:03:29.209 --> 00:03:31.509 
back and I did take a few on the trip
because<00:03:29.989> sometimes<00:03:30.709> like<00:03:31.040> I<00:03:31.190> won't<00:03:31.370> actually

00:03:31.509 --> 00:03:31.519 
because sometimes like I won't actually

00:03:31.519 --> 00:03:33.129 
because sometimes like I won't actually
feel<00:03:31.880> physically<00:03:32.420> sick<00:03:32.450> but<00:03:32.870> I'll<00:03:32.959> get<00:03:33.109> a

00:03:33.129 --> 00:03:33.139 
feel physically sick but I'll get a

00:03:33.139 --> 00:03:35.410 
feel physically sick but I'll get a
little<00:03:33.350> bit<00:03:33.470> of<00:03:33.650> a<00:03:33.709> headache<00:03:33.970> and<00:03:34.970> this<00:03:35.150> takes

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:35.420 
little bit of a headache and this takes

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:37.870 
little bit of a headache and this takes
care<00:03:35.750> of<00:03:35.810> that<00:03:36.109> so<00:03:36.410> Bo<00:03:36.889> 9<00:03:37.100> is<00:03:37.549> what<00:03:37.850> I

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:37.880 
care of that so Bo 9 is what I

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:41.530 
care of that so Bo 9 is what I
definitely<00:03:38.269> recommend<00:03:38.569> for<00:03:39.530> seasickness<00:03:40.540> and

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:41.540 
definitely recommend for seasickness and

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:44.860 
definitely recommend for seasickness and
then<00:03:41.690> we<00:03:41.780> also<00:03:41.989> have<00:03:42.380> some<00:03:42.859> gas<00:03:43.430> acts<00:03:43.870> another

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:44.870 
then we also have some gas acts another

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:47.170
