00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:11.280
 Hi guys 

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:13.920
 This is a mechanical drive and today we will have a vidosik 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:16.350
 You know about the cruiser 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:18.539
 began to notice such a thing that tanchiki 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:20.789
 which I like with my appearance 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:23.250
 starts i like out gameplay 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:25.230
 point of view and one of these tanchiki 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:27.750
 recently became a cruiser 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:30.810
 I have long noticed this typewriter British 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:33.630
 branches and she told me very, very, very much 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:35.430
 liked its appearance but under 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:37.710
 gameplay point of view this tanchik 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:40.410
 I was absolutely not attracted because 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:43.980
 This is a LT-scale with a maximum speed of 45 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:46.200
 kilometers per hour and in fact it is a nile. 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:48.809
 This is a medium tank but a medium tank which 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:51.149
 has its unique chips first 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:53.670
 since the developers have identified this tank 

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:56.399
 how light is lightweight tanks have a chip 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:57.930
 that the tank when stationary has 

00:00:56.399 --> 00:01:00.780
 exactly the same masking ratio 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:03.090
 as in motion that is rolling on the field 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:05.460
 robins with enlightened optics you 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:08.130
 can flash your opponents 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:10.320
 without lightening yourself because 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:13.920
 you masking factor is much better 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:15.960
 than your opponent but 2 chips 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:18.659
 This tank, I think this is what is 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:20.460
 opportunity to take the orlik medal once 

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:22.320
 this is a light tank means a light tank 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:24.060
 it is possible to take the actual 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:25.830
 Orlik medal but there is a small 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:28.080
 poser load and grief like me 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:30.930
 It seemed to take a lot of Orlik medal 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:32.310
 harder than on the same tree or watch 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:33.570
 firstly due to the fact that we have 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:36.540
 rather weak 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:38.070
 gun yes we have a breakthrough gold 180 

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:40.470
 millimeters if you charge 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:42.150
 enough gold as you see with me and 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:44.880
 and 50 in ammunition 

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:47.340
 i.e. this is a big part of it basically 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:49.710
 problems with breaking those six tanks 7 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:51.329
 level you will not have but the fact is that 

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:52.920
 here ammunition is very small 

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:55.170
 sixty five shells would seem 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:57.990
 quite a lot but 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:02:01.110
 tailor with this dpms rate of fire 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:03.329
 these shells end very quickly and have 

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:04.340
 I even had some situations when 

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:06.560
 these shells are not 

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:09.470
 enough and due to this we poured the tub 

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:11.930
 and believe me this is really a shame I 

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:13.819
 the situation is by the way when i bought a cruiser 

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:16.280
 I was very interested in him 

00:02:13.819 --> 00:02:18.530
 the gun that is the same gun itself 

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:20.620
 which stands on the Soviet Churchill and 

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:23.150
 premium and me she is very much 

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:25.700
 interested because she firstly 

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:28.819
 very quick second good 

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:31.580
 Gold break but she has a few 

00:02:28.819 --> 00:02:34.580
 cons is quite a long speed 

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:37.519
 information and bad enough accuracy but 

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:39.860
 the joke is that when you are completely 

00:02:37.519 --> 00:02:41.930
 come together as if the shells are flying well, not 

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:43.579
 very straight that is to get with this 

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:46.549
 guns over long distance it's still 

00:02:43.579 --> 00:02:48.650
 need to try but when you shoot with 

00:02:46.549 --> 00:02:51.440
 wizards shells almost always 

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:54.620
 go where you send well, plus or minus 

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:55.459
 regarding its accuracy with the guard 

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:58.250
 this tanchik 

00:02:55.459 --> 00:03:00.379
 not very bad shoots and it 

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:03.530
 gives such a unique feeling 

00:03:00.379 --> 00:03:05.500
 when it seems like a tanchik is very accurate 

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:08.540
 when you shoot from the floor of the guard but 

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:10.989
 when you get off completely this tanchik 

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:13.940
 really mows me a little bit 

00:03:10.989 --> 00:03:16.670
 let's say so annoying but still 

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:19.549
 it delivered a lot to me 

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:21.680
 unique feeling and i think every 

00:03:19.549 --> 00:03:23.060
 of you must experience it but now 

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:25.310
 a little bit about choice 

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:27.560
 additional modules on the cruiser 

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:30.560
 I put the rammer here 

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:32.959
 crosstalk and stereo will now explain on 

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:36.049
 order rammer this in order to 

00:03:32.959 --> 00:03:39.079
 strengthen our good dm since i 

00:03:36.049 --> 00:03:41.120
 played on cruz and a hole in dpm i mean i 

00:03:39.079 --> 00:03:43.639
 tried to keep us as much as possible 

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:46.250
 average damage but also due to 

00:03:43.639 --> 00:03:48.680
 I tried my little stereo 

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:50.599
 still on candles vat and by the way cruiser 

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:53.780
 became one of those tanks on which I 

00:03:50.599 --> 00:03:55.790
 took three marks on the barrel but I took them 

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:58.220
 in just two days you imagine 

00:03:55.790 --> 00:04:01.220
 sample rolled up 2 good sessions of 40 

00:03:58.220 --> 00:04:04.130
 fights and for 80 fights exactly 80 shares I 

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:07.160
 took on it three marks on the trunk yes 

00:04:04.130 --> 00:04:09.169
 of course after 90 percent there was not much 

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:10.930
 difficult to take and had to charge 

00:04:09.169 --> 00:04:14.200
 almost fu gold 

00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:16.690
 and put the dog poop here 

00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:18.579
 but at the same time I have been misting all my life 

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:20.470
 three marks and now you are watching the fight 

00:04:18.579 --> 00:04:22.630
 actually in which I took them 

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:24.550
 but now a little bit about 

00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:27.370
 drives aiming them to put here 

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:30.070
 necessarily if you want to stuff on 

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:32.259
 there is damage that is when this tanchik 

00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:34.210
 reloading gun nominally not 

00:04:32.259 --> 00:04:37.270
 manages to come down to him 

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:39.520
 and you almost always have to 

00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:42.070
 shoot with incomplete information and this 

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:43.840
 very annoying I mean, I already 

00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:45.580
 talked about the shells without 

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:48.550
 full details fly here more or less 

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:50.530
 exactly but guys when you sit down all 

00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:53.860
 equal shells will fly anyway 

00:04:50.530 --> 00:04:56.259
 more precisely than the sleighs and drives slept 

00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:57.729
 tips are very much justified here and 

00:04:56.259 --> 00:04:59.620
 summing up a small summary on the cruiser 

00:04:57.729 --> 00:05:02.110
 I would like to say that this is tanchik 

00:04:59.620 --> 00:05:04.000
 provides an unusual gameplay that is 

00:05:02.110 --> 00:05:06.190
 This is a unique car that is on its 

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:08.380
 level is able to deliver a lot 

00:05:06.190 --> 00:05:10.180
 pleasure to its owner of course 

00:05:08.380 --> 00:05:12.400
 on condition that you are right 

00:05:10.180 --> 00:05:14.020
 enjoy its advantages as well 

00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:15.849
 cruiser owners i would like 

00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:18.490
 ask to unsubscribe in the comments and 

00:05:15.849 --> 00:05:19.330
 write about how you live now 

00:05:18.490 --> 00:05:21.430
 him in random 

00:05:19.330 --> 00:05:23.020
 well guys if you need this video 

00:05:21.430 --> 00:05:24.729
 liked to put the class and 

00:05:23.020 --> 00:05:27.340
 subscribe to my channel not to 

00:05:24.729 --> 00:05:30.300
 miss my new vidosiki thanks for 

00:05:27.340 --> 00:05:30.300
 view everyone good luck
