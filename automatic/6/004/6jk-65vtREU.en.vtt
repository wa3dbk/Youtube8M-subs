look anything like that and it's still

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:38.290 
look anything like that and it's still
way<00:02:37.550> smaller

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:38.300 
way smaller

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:40.240 
way smaller
just<00:02:38.720> like<00:02:38.870> other<00:02:39.080> legends<00:02:39.650> and<00:02:39.830> South<00:02:40.010> Texas

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:40.250 
just like other legends and South Texas

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:42.520 
just like other legends and South Texas
like<00:02:40.640> the<00:02:40.790> chupacabra<00:02:40.940> there's<00:02:41.810> no<00:02:42.110> way<00:02:42.350> of

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:42.530 
like the chupacabra there's no way of
