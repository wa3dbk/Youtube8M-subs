00:00:43.069 --> 00:00:43.079 
concept this one right here is is one of

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:45.170 
concept this one right here is is one of
my<00:00:43.170> favorites<00:00:43.559> okay<00:00:44.309> that<00:00:44.520> the<00:00:44.789> technique

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.180 
my favorites okay that the technique

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:50.389 
my favorites okay that the technique
itself<00:00:45.480> is<00:00:45.719> very<00:00:47.480> well<00:00:48.480> thought-out<00:00:49.070> okay<00:00:50.070> and

00:00:50.389 --> 00:00:50.399 
itself is very well thought-out okay and

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:53.000 
itself is very well thought-out okay and
it's<00:00:50.780> well<00:00:51.780> it<00:00:52.020> has<00:00:52.140> the<00:00:52.289> obvious<00:00:52.649> advantage

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
it's well it has the obvious advantage

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:54.740 
it's well it has the obvious advantage
of<00:00:53.160> being<00:00:53.550> able<00:00:53.730> to<00:00:53.879> be<00:00:54.030> done<00:00:54.180> with<00:00:54.300> one<00:00:54.510> hand

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750 
of being able to be done with one hand

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:56.930 
of being able to be done with one hand
so<00:00:55.710> this<00:00:55.980> is<00:00:56.129> definitely<00:00:56.430> a<00:00:56.550> good<00:00:56.699> one<00:00:56.850> to

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
so this is definitely a good one to

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:59.750 
so this is definitely a good one to
learn<00:00:57.120> and<00:00:57.770> I'll<00:00:58.770> show<00:00:58.980> you<00:00:59.100> how<00:00:59.190> to<00:00:59.250> do<00:00:59.399> it<00:00:59.550> so

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
learn and I'll show you how to do it so

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:02.510 
learn and I'll show you how to do it so
let's<00:00:59.910> break<00:01:00.090> it<00:01:00.210> down<00:01:01.309> you're<00:01:02.309> going<00:01:02.430> to

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:02.520 
let's break it down you're going to

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:05.350 
let's break it down you're going to
start<00:01:02.730> with<00:01:02.879> the<00:01:02.969> cards<00:01:03.149> and<00:01:03.629> a<00:01:04.220> modified

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:05.360 
start with the cards and a modified

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:08.480 
start with the cards and a modified
Biddle<00:01:06.360> grip<00:01:06.590> okay<00:01:07.590> so<00:01:07.650> it's<00:01:07.890> exactly<00:01:08.250> like<00:01:08.340> a

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
Biddle grip okay so it's exactly like a

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:11.450 
Biddle grip okay so it's exactly like a
standard<00:01:09.240> builder<00:01:09.540> if<00:01:09.659> except<00:01:10.140> your<00:01:10.979> pinky

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
standard builder if except your pinky

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:13.810 
standard builder if except your pinky
the<00:01:12.119> tip<00:01:12.360> of<00:01:12.510> it<00:01:12.630> is<00:01:12.720> going<00:01:12.869> to<00:01:12.960> be<00:01:13.049> contacting

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:13.820 
the tip of it is going to be contacting

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:16.910 
the tip of it is going to be contacting
the<00:01:14.820> top<00:01:15.090> right<00:01:15.360> corner<00:01:15.780> of<00:01:15.960> the<00:01:16.350> top<00:01:16.560> card<00:01:16.830> of

the top right corner of the top card of
the<00:01:17.009> deck<00:01:17.540> okay<00:01:18.799> so<00:01:19.799> something<00:01:20.280> like<00:01:20.430> this

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:23.600 

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:26.690

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.500 
need to have a bit of friction between

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:32.120 
need to have a bit of friction between
your<00:01:28.979> pinky<00:01:29.250> in<00:01:29.640> the<00:01:29.820> top<00:01:30.329> right<00:01:30.540> corner<00:01:30.720> so<00:01:31.130> if

just want to lick it but normally you

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:38.300 
just want to lick it but normally you
know<00:01:37.049> you'll<00:01:37.259> be<00:01:37.380> fine<00:01:37.409> you<00:01:37.920> don't<00:01:38.100> need<00:01:38.220> that

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
know you'll be fine you don't need that

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:40.069 
know you'll be fine you don't need that
much<00:01:38.460> because<00:01:39.210> what<00:01:39.479> you're<00:01:39.570> going<00:01:39.689> to<00:01:39.750> do<00:01:39.900> is

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:40.079 
much because what you're going to do is

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:43.160 
much because what you're going to do is
you're<00:01:41.009> going<00:01:41.100> to<00:01:41.159> push<00:01:41.850> on<00:01:42.210> the<00:01:42.540> top<00:01:42.930> right

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 
you're going to push on the top right

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:46.940 
you're going to push on the top right
corner<00:01:44.420> outwards<00:01:45.590> and<00:01:46.590> that's<00:01:46.770> going<00:01:46.890> to

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:46.950 
corner outwards and that's going to

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:49.819 
corner outwards and that's going to
cause<00:01:47.130> this<00:01:47.310> card<00:01:47.640> to<00:01:48.210> get<00:01:49.200> angle<00:01:49.560> jogged

00:01:49.819 --> 00:01:49.829 
cause this card to get angle jogged

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:51.889 
cause this card to get angle jogged
slightly<00:01:50.490> you'll<00:01:50.820> need<00:01:51.149> to<00:01:51.240> angle<00:01:51.420> target

00:01:51.889 --> 00:01:51.899 
slightly you'll need to angle target

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:57.709 
slightly you'll need to angle target
just<00:01:52.350> a<00:01:52.500> little<00:01:52.740> bit<00:01:52.920> from<00:01:53.700> here<00:01:54.290> to<00:01:55.290> here<00:01:56.719> okay

00:01:57.709 --> 00:01:57.719 
just a little bit from here to here okay

00:01:57.719 --> 00:01:58.999 
just a little bit from here to here okay
I<00:01:57.930> guess<00:01:58.320> when<00:01:58.469> you're<00:01:58.530> starting<00:01:58.740> out<00:01:58.950> you

00:01:58.999 --> 00:01:59.009 
I guess when you're starting out you

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:00.980 
I guess when you're starting out you
might<00:01:59.130> want<00:01:59.399> to<00:01:59.460> angle<00:01:59.820> cha<00:02:00.060> get<00:02:00.270> a<00:02:00.450> lot<00:02:00.719> more

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:00.990 
might want to angle cha get a lot more

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:03.620 
might want to angle cha get a lot more
just<00:02:01.799> to<00:02:01.979> get<00:02:02.100> used<00:02:02.310> to<00:02:02.399> the<00:02:02.520> technique<00:02:02.909> that's

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:03.630 
just to get used to the technique that's

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:05.480 
just to get used to the technique that's
the<00:02:03.780> idea<00:02:04.020> so<00:02:04.200> if<00:02:04.259> I<00:02:04.380> remove<00:02:04.590> my<00:02:04.710> hand<00:02:05.040> here's

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:05.490 
the idea so if I remove my hand here's

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:09.740 
the idea so if I remove my hand here's
that<00:02:05.670> position<00:02:06.149> of<00:02:06.240> the<00:02:06.329> top<00:02:06.509> card<00:02:08.629> so<00:02:09.629> it's

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:09.750 
that position of the top card so it's

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:11.720 
that position of the top card so it's
hanging<00:02:10.020> out<00:02:10.319> just<00:02:10.590> a<00:02:10.709> little<00:02:10.739> bit<00:02:11.190> from<00:02:11.580> the

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:11.730 
hanging out just a little bit from the

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:12.230 
hanging out just a little bit from the
front<00:02:11.970> edge<00:02:12.090> of

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:12.240 
front edge of

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:16.360 
front edge of
Dec<00:02:12.480> and<00:02:12.930> you<00:02:13.500> can<00:02:13.650> see<00:02:13.800> you<00:02:13.920> singled<00:02:14.370> away

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:16.370 
Dec and you can see you singled away

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:20.360 
Dec and you can see you singled away
once<00:02:17.370> you<00:02:17.460> have<00:02:17.610> done<00:02:17.820> that<00:02:19.190> you're<00:02:20.190> going<00:02:20.250> to

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:20.370 
once you have done that you're going to

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:21.830 
once you have done that you're going to
readjust<00:02:20.730> your<00:02:21.090> pinkie<00:02:21.390> a<00:02:21.420> little<00:02:21.660> bit<00:02:21.750> you're

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:21.840 
readjust your pinkie a little bit you're

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:24.100 
readjust your pinkie a little bit you're
going<00:02:21.930> to<00:02:22.020> move<00:02:22.110> it<00:02:22.230> forward<00:02:22.560> to<00:02:22.770> the<00:02:22.890> very

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:24.110 
going to move it forward to the very

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:29.170 
going to move it forward to the very
front<00:02:25.110> edge<00:02:25.410> of<00:02:25.620> that<00:02:25.770> card<00:02:26.100> of<00:02:26.550> the<00:02:26.700> corner

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:29.180 

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:32.120 

and<00:02:30.180> you're<00:02:30.300> going<00:02:30.450> to<00:02:30.540> push<00:02:30.900> down<00:02:30.930> on<00:02:31.260> it<00:02:31.500> now

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:32.130 
and you're going to push down on it now

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:33.350 
and you're going to push down on it now
let<00:02:32.370> me<00:02:32.430> try<00:02:32.580> to<00:02:32.610> give<00:02:32.850> you<00:02:32.880> an<00:02:33.000> exposed

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:33.360 
let me try to give you an exposed

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:35.420 
let me try to give you an exposed
anywhere<00:02:33.750> maybe<00:02:34.140> this<00:02:34.410> is<00:02:34.560> a<00:02:34.590> good<00:02:34.830> way<00:02:35.400> to

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:35.430 
anywhere maybe this is a good way to

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:38.290 
anywhere maybe this is a good way to
show<00:02:35.640> you<00:02:36.020> when<00:02:37.020> you<00:02:37.110> push<00:02:37.500> down<00:02:37.530> on<00:02:38.100> that

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:38.300 
show you when you push down on that

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:41.570 
show you when you push down on that
corner<00:02:39.300> with<00:02:39.480> your<00:02:39.510> pinkie<00:02:40.040> the<00:02:41.040> card<00:02:41.340> is

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:41.580 
corner with your pinkie the card is

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:44.000 
corner with your pinkie the card is
going<00:02:41.790> to<00:02:42.000> spring<00:02:42.930> up<00:02:43.230> okay<00:02:43.680> now<00:02:43.770> there's<00:02:43.950> a

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:44.010 
going to spring up okay now there's a

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:46.610 
going to spring up okay now there's a
there's<00:02:44.730> a<00:02:44.820> tension<00:02:45.060> point<00:02:45.450> here<00:02:45.600> because<00:02:45.810> my

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:46.620 
there's a tension point here because my

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:50.510 
there's a tension point here because my
thumb<00:02:47.160> is<00:02:48.020> holding<00:02:49.020> the<00:02:49.770> bottom<00:02:50.190> left<00:02:50.430> corner

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:50.520 
thumb is holding the bottom left corner

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:53.600 
thumb is holding the bottom left corner
of<00:02:50.850> that<00:02:51.000> card<00:02:51.830> so<00:02:52.830> when<00:02:52.980> I<00:02:53.040> push<00:02:53.340> with<00:02:53.490> my

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:53.610 
of that card so when I push with my

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:55.250 
of that card so when I push with my
pinkie<00:02:53.970> I'm<00:02:54.090> creating<00:02:54.510> a<00:02:54.630> little<00:02:54.930> bit<00:02:55.080> of

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:55.260 
pinkie I'm creating a little bit of

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:57.530 
pinkie I'm creating a little bit of
tension<00:02:55.560> there<00:02:55.740> and<00:02:56.040> now<00:02:56.670> if<00:02:56.850> I<00:02:56.970> release<00:02:57.330> with

00:02:57.530 --> 00:02:57.540 
tension there and now if I release with

00:02:57.540 --> 00:02:59.260 
tension there and now if I release with
my<00:02:57.660> thumb<00:02:57.870> a<00:02:57.900> little<00:02:58.170> bit<00:02:58.290> if<00:02:58.350> I<00:02:58.410> curl<00:02:58.680> it<00:02:58.800> in

00:02:59.260 --> 00:02:59.270 
my thumb a little bit if I curl it in

00:02:59.270 --> 00:03:03.260 
my thumb a little bit if I curl it in
that<00:03:00.270> crys<00:03:00.510> just<00:03:00.810> going<00:03:00.960> to<00:03:01.020> fling<00:03:01.620> up<00:03:02.270> and

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:03.270 
that crys just going to fling up and

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:06.740 
that crys just going to fling up and
it's<00:03:03.390> going<00:03:03.480> to<00:03:03.540> jump<00:03:03.810> it<00:03:03.930> to<00:03:04.050> my<00:03:04.140> hand<00:03:05.750> all

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:06.750 
it's going to jump it to my hand all

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:10.250 
it's going to jump it to my hand all
right<00:03:07.610> now<00:03:08.610> you<00:03:08.670> can<00:03:08.910> start<00:03:09.210> off<00:03:09.420> with<00:03:09.780> the

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:10.260 
right now you can start off with the

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:11.990 
right now you can start off with the
thumb<00:03:10.560> kind<00:03:10.830> of<00:03:10.980> curled<00:03:11.220> in<00:03:11.430> so<00:03:11.580> that<00:03:11.700> I<00:03:11.760> never

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:12.000 
thumb kind of curled in so that I never

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:15.310 
thumb kind of curled in so that I never
I<00:03:12.770> produces<00:03:13.770> that<00:03:13.890> resistance<00:03:14.430> there<00:03:14.670> and

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:15.320 
I produces that resistance there and

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:18.830 
I produces that resistance there and
that<00:03:16.320> way<00:03:16.470> you'll<00:03:16.680> have<00:03:16.740> a<00:03:16.920> smoother<00:03:17.610> top<00:03:18.600> palm

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:18.840 
that way you'll have a smoother top palm

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:21.800 
that way you'll have a smoother top palm
so<00:03:19.230> let<00:03:19.350> me<00:03:19.440> give<00:03:19.620> you<00:03:19.740> maybe<00:03:20.460> a<00:03:20.610> palm<00:03:20.910> up<00:03:21.180> angle

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:21.810 
so let me give you maybe a palm up angle

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:24.260 
so let me give you maybe a palm up angle
for<00:03:21.960> this<00:03:22.490> this<00:03:23.490> is<00:03:23.610> actually<00:03:23.940> a<00:03:23.970> good<00:03:24.090> way<00:03:24.210> to

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:24.270 
for this this is actually a good way to

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:26.360 
for this this is actually a good way to
practice<00:03:24.890> because<00:03:25.890> it<00:03:26.040> makes<00:03:26.190> no<00:03:26.250> difference

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:26.370 
practice because it makes no difference

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:28.190 
practice because it makes no difference
whether<00:03:26.880> your<00:03:27.120> hand<00:03:27.300> is<00:03:27.390> like<00:03:27.750> this<00:03:27.930> or<00:03:28.170> like

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:28.200 
whether your hand is like this or like

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:30.230 
whether your hand is like this or like
this<00:03:28.500> when<00:03:28.710> when<00:03:29.130> doing<00:03:29.340> this<00:03:29.430> move<00:03:29.640> obviously

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:30.240 
this when when doing this move obviously

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:31.880 
this when when doing this move obviously
in<00:03:30.600> performance<00:03:31.050> you<00:03:31.170> would<00:03:31.260> do<00:03:31.380> it<00:03:31.500> palm<00:03:31.680> down

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:31.890 
in performance you would do it palm down

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:34.460 
in performance you would do it palm down
but<00:03:32.580> for<00:03:32.730> practice<00:03:33.090> sake<00:03:33.270> do<00:03:33.810> it<00:03:33.930> palm<00:03:34.080> up<00:03:34.230> just

00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:34.470 
but for practice sake do it palm up just

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:37.330 
but for practice sake do it palm up just
to<00:03:34.590> get<00:03:34.740> a<00:03:34.770> better<00:03:34.980> idea<00:03:35.190> of<00:03:35.630> what's<00:03:36.630> going<00:03:36.900> on

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:37.340 
to get a better idea of what's going on

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:41.180 
to get a better idea of what's going on
so<00:03:38.340> I'm<00:03:38.460> pushing<00:03:38.760> that<00:03:39.590> top<00:03:40.590> corner<00:03:41.040> of<00:03:41.070> the

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:41.190 
so I'm pushing that top corner of the

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:44.750 
so I'm pushing that top corner of the
card<00:03:41.490> with<00:03:41.670> my<00:03:41.790> pinky<00:03:42.150> just<00:03:43.080> angle<00:03:43.980> drawing<00:03:44.490> it

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:44.760 
card with my pinky just angle drawing it

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:48.080 
card with my pinky just angle drawing it
just<00:03:45.150> a<00:03:45.240> little<00:03:45.390> bit<00:03:45.560> and<00:03:46.560> now<00:03:46.920> I<00:03:46.980> push<00:03:47.520> on<00:03:47.790> that

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:48.090 
just a little bit and now I push on that

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:51.260 
just a little bit and now I push on that
corner<00:03:48.480> and<00:03:49.350> it's<00:03:49.950> going<00:03:50.070> to<00:03:50.130> flank<00:03:50.550> into

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:51.270 
corner and it's going to flank into

00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:54.320 
corner and it's going to flank into
perfect<00:03:51.660> position<00:03:52.520> so<00:03:53.520> now<00:03:53.550> if<00:03:53.790> I<00:03:53.880> remove<00:03:54.150> this

00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:54.330 
perfect position so now if I remove this

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:58.010 
perfect position so now if I remove this
deck<00:03:55.220> you'll<00:03:56.220> notice<00:03:56.580> that<00:03:56.760> it<00:03:57.030> is<00:03:57.060> in<00:03:57.360> the

00:03:58.010 --> 00:03:58.020 
deck you'll notice that it is in the

00:03:58.020 --> 00:04:01.940 
deck you'll notice that it is in the
proper<00:03:58.260> classic<00:03:59.040> palm<00:03:59.220> position<00:04:00.590> okay<00:04:01.590> this

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:01.950 
proper classic palm position okay this

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:03.680 
proper classic palm position okay this
is<00:04:02.070> an<00:04:02.190> a<00:04:02.310> key<00:04:02.370> move<00:04:02.670> it's<00:04:03.270> going<00:04:03.480> to<00:04:03.540> take

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:03.690 
is an a key move it's going to take

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:09.170 
is an a key move it's going to take
practice<00:04:03.870> but<00:04:06.410> the<00:04:07.410> the<00:04:08.070> concept<00:04:08.490> behind<00:04:08.700> is

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:09.180 
practice but the the concept behind is

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:13.760 
practice but the the concept behind is
is<00:04:09.420> very<00:04:09.870> simple<00:04:11.870> so<00:04:12.870> I'm<00:04:13.020> going<00:04:13.260> to<00:04:13.290> push

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:13.770 
is very simple so I'm going to push

00:04:13.770 --> 00:04:17.390 
is very simple so I'm going to push
right<00:04:13.920> there<00:04:15.049> I'm<00:04:16.049> going<00:04:16.260> to<00:04:16.320> allow<00:04:16.980> the<00:04:17.040> car

00:04:17.390 --> 00:04:17.400 
right there I'm going to allow the car

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:21.979 
right there I'm going to allow the car
to<00:04:17.430> clear<00:04:17.910> my<00:04:18.780> thumb<00:04:19.280> well<00:04:20.280> I<00:04:20.609> just<00:04:21.150> flipped<00:04:21.810> it

00:04:21.979 --> 00:04:21.989 
to clear my thumb well I just flipped it

00:04:21.989 --> 00:04:24.760 
to clear my thumb well I just flipped it
feels<00:04:22.500> good<00:04:22.770> too<00:04:23.070> I<00:04:23.280> could<00:04:23.760> do<00:04:23.880> this<00:04:24.000> move

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:24.770 
feels good too I could do this move

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:28.900 
feels good too I could do this move
I'm<00:04:25.580> just<00:04:25.849> gonna<00:04:25.940> and<00:04:26.300> now<00:04:27.039> you<00:04:28.039> know<00:04:28.160> when<00:04:28.819> you

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:28.910 
I'm just gonna and now you know when you

00:04:28.910 --> 00:04:33.339 
I'm just gonna and now you know when you
first<00:04:29.120> start<00:04:29.419> the<00:04:29.720> card<00:04:29.990> might<00:04:30.490> not<00:04:31.490> be<00:04:32.349> flamed

00:04:33.339 --> 00:04:33.349 
first start the card might not be flamed

00:04:33.349 --> 00:04:36.779 
first start the card might not be flamed
into<00:04:33.710> the<00:04:33.800> perfect<00:04:34.009> position<00:04:34.280> it<00:04:34.819> might<00:04:35.110> be

00:04:36.779 --> 00:04:36.789 
into the perfect position it might be

00:04:36.789 --> 00:04:39.309 
into the perfect position it might be
flashing<00:04:37.789> right<00:04:38.360> it<00:04:38.569> might<00:04:38.690> be<00:04:38.750> sticking<00:04:39.169> out

00:04:39.309 --> 00:04:39.319 
flashing right it might be sticking out

00:04:39.319 --> 00:04:41.170 
flashing right it might be sticking out
so<00:04:39.889> that's<00:04:40.069> just<00:04:40.220> something<00:04:40.430> that<00:04:40.550> you<00:04:40.669> know

00:04:41.170 --> 00:04:41.180 
so that's just something that you know

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:43.180 
so that's just something that you know
is<00:04:41.270> going<00:04:41.419> to<00:04:41.479> come<00:04:41.630> with<00:04:41.720> practice<00:04:42.190> you're

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:43.190 
is going to come with practice you're

00:04:43.190 --> 00:04:44.650 
is going to come with practice you're
going<00:04:43.340> to<00:04:43.460> you're<00:04:44.060> going<00:04:44.180> to<00:04:44.240> get<00:04:44.449> a<00:04:44.479> better

00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:44.660 
going to you're going to get a better

00:04:44.660 --> 00:04:46.570 
going to you're going to get a better
idea<00:04:44.840> of<00:04:45.110> where<00:04:45.919> you<00:04:46.099> need<00:04:46.220> to<00:04:46.340> apply<00:04:46.550> that

00:04:46.570 --> 00:04:46.580 
idea of where you need to apply that

00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:49.689 
idea of where you need to apply that
pressure<00:04:46.729> in<00:04:47.270> order<00:04:47.509> for<00:04:47.750> it<00:04:47.840> to<00:04:47.870> pull<00:04:48.590> in<00:04:48.889> the

00:04:49.689 --> 00:04:49.699 
pressure in order for it to pull in the

00:04:49.699 --> 00:04:52.930 
pressure in order for it to pull in the
perfect<00:04:50.090> spot<00:04:50.349> so<00:04:51.349> you<00:04:52.099> know<00:04:52.190> just<00:04:52.400> experiment

00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:52.940 
perfect spot so you know just experiment

00:04:52.940 --> 00:04:55.360 
perfect spot so you know just experiment
with<00:04:52.970> that<00:04:53.180> and<00:04:53.599> you'll<00:04:53.960> get<00:04:54.169> it<00:04:54.319> but<00:04:55.220> that's

00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:55.370 
with that and you'll get it but that's

00:04:55.370 --> 00:04:56.890 
with that and you'll get it but that's
really<00:04:55.580> the<00:04:55.699> basic<00:04:56.120> concept<00:04:56.479> behind<00:04:56.539> a<00:04:56.720> move

00:04:56.890 --> 00:04:56.900 
really the basic concept behind a move

00:04:56.900 --> 00:04:58.420 
really the basic concept behind a move
there's<00:04:57.229> not<00:04:57.409> really<00:04:57.590> much<00:04:57.800> else<00:04:57.860> I<00:04:58.099> can<00:04:58.130> tell

00:04:58.420 --> 00:04:58.430 
there's not really much else I can tell

00:04:58.430 --> 00:05:01.089 
there's not really much else I can tell
you<00:04:58.550> about<00:04:58.699> it<00:04:59.080> but<00:05:00.080> I<00:05:00.139> will<00:05:00.380> what<00:05:00.710> I<00:05:00.740> will<00:05:00.830> say

00:05:01.089 --> 00:05:01.099 
you about it but I will what I will say

00:05:01.099 --> 00:05:05.649 
you about it but I will what I will say
is<00:05:01.840> this<00:05:02.840> move<00:05:03.139> should<00:05:03.319> be<00:05:03.380> done<00:05:04.449> in<00:05:05.449> an

00:05:05.649 --> 00:05:05.659 
is this move should be done in an

00:05:05.659 --> 00:05:07.300 
is this move should be done in an
offbeat<00:05:05.840> in<00:05:06.229> a<00:05:06.560> moment<00:05:06.919> of<00:05:06.979> relaxation

00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:07.310 
offbeat in a moment of relaxation

00:05:07.310 --> 00:05:09.939 
offbeat in a moment of relaxation
because<00:05:07.789> from<00:05:08.180> the<00:05:08.270> front<00:05:08.539> it<00:05:09.470> is<00:05:09.650> covered

00:05:09.939 --> 00:05:09.949 
because from the front it is covered

00:05:09.949 --> 00:05:12.129 
because from the front it is covered
right<00:05:10.130> very<00:05:10.490> well<00:05:10.699> but<00:05:11.120> there's<00:05:11.900> sometimes

00:05:12.129 --> 00:05:12.139 
right very well but there's sometimes

00:05:12.139 --> 00:05:14.320 
right very well but there's sometimes
will<00:05:12.500> be<00:05:12.530> a<00:05:12.680> flash<00:05:13.009> there's<00:05:13.729> definitely<00:05:14.300> a

00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:14.330 
will be a flash there's definitely a

00:05:14.330 --> 00:05:18.249 
will be a flash there's definitely a
nose<00:05:14.630> a<00:05:14.870> noticeable<00:05:15.530> change<00:05:16.419> and<00:05:17.419> tension<00:05:18.050> in

00:05:18.249 --> 00:05:18.259 
nose a noticeable change and tension in

00:05:18.259 --> 00:05:23.159 
nose a noticeable change and tension in
your<00:05:18.380> hand<00:05:18.620> when<00:05:18.830> doing<00:05:19.039> this<00:05:19.099> move<00:05:19.340> okay<00:05:20.530> so

00:05:23.159 --> 00:05:23.169 
your hand when doing this move okay so

00:05:23.169 --> 00:05:26.379 
your hand when doing this move okay so
try<00:05:24.169> to<00:05:24.259> do<00:05:24.470> this<00:05:24.590> when<00:05:24.889> the<00:05:25.250> spectators<00:05:25.759> are

00:05:26.379 --> 00:05:26.389 
try to do this when the spectators are

00:05:26.389 --> 00:05:28.749 
try to do this when the spectators are
not<00:05:26.720> looking<00:05:27.169> at<00:05:27.289> the<00:05:27.409> pack<00:05:27.590> okay<00:05:28.250> so<00:05:28.310> but

00:05:28.749 --> 00:05:28.759 
not looking at the pack okay so but

00:05:28.759 --> 00:05:30.010 
not looking at the pack okay so but
since<00:05:29.000> it's<00:05:29.180> done<00:05:29.330> with<00:05:29.509> one<00:05:29.659> hand<00:05:29.870> that's

00:05:30.010 --> 00:05:30.020 
since it's done with one hand that's

00:05:30.020 --> 00:05:31.480 
since it's done with one hand that's
very<00:05:30.169> easy<00:05:30.349> to<00:05:30.380> do<00:05:30.560> just<00:05:30.830> gesture<00:05:31.159> your<00:05:31.310> left

00:05:31.480 --> 00:05:31.490 
very easy to do just gesture your left

00:05:31.490 --> 00:05:35.129 
very easy to do just gesture your left
hand<00:05:31.669> boom<00:05:31.940> do<00:05:32.150> the<00:05:32.240> move<00:05:32.449> and<00:05:32.810> you're<00:05:33.560> done

00:05:35.129 --> 00:05:35.139 
hand boom do the move and you're done

00:05:35.139 --> 00:05:37.870 
hand boom do the move and you're done
okay<00:05:36.139> it<00:05:36.530> can<00:05:36.770> be<00:05:36.800> done<00:05:37.070> when<00:05:37.490> your<00:05:37.610> hands<00:05:37.759> are

00:05:37.870 --> 00:05:37.880 
okay it can be done when your hands are

00:05:37.880 --> 00:05:39.480 
okay it can be done when your hands are
being<00:05:38.060> burned<00:05:38.300> and<00:05:38.570> you'll<00:05:38.930> probably<00:05:39.139> be<00:05:39.349> okay

00:05:39.480 --> 00:05:39.490 
being burned and you'll probably be okay

00:05:39.490 --> 00:05:42.939 
being burned and you'll probably be okay
but<00:05:40.490> it's<00:05:40.610> just<00:05:40.699> better<00:05:40.969> if<00:05:41.300> it's<00:05:42.259> not<00:05:42.530> done<00:05:42.800> in

00:05:42.939 --> 00:05:42.949 
but it's just better if it's not done in

00:05:42.949 --> 00:05:45.070 
but it's just better if it's not done in
that<00:05:43.099> moment<00:05:43.630> all<00:05:44.630> right<00:05:44.810> that's<00:05:45.020> the

00:05:45.070 --> 00:05:45.080 
that moment all right that's the
