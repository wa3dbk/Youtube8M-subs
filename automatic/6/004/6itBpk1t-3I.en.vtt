00:00:01.200 --> 00:00:05.100
 The first step to put a car aside is to have a good reason. 

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:11.350
 There are many reasons to put a car aside, but you have to have a good one. 

00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:18.950
 Examples are driving through a red traffic light, driving too fast and many other things. 

00:00:19.030 --> 00:00:25.000
 Those were just a few examples, but there are numerous! 

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:30.040
 Once you have a reason, put on your siren, and have you and the car stop on the right side of the road. 

00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:33.590
 Then you want to tell the control room that you have stopped traffic. 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:42.840
 Then enter your name and unit number on the radio. 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:57.650
 Now walk quietly to the vehicle, and ask the occupant's name. 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:01.370
 Hello, can I see a license plate and ID? 

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:05.050
 My name is kfperin. 

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:12.080
 Then you want to check at the control room whether this person has done anything wrong. 

00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:13.650
 37 - Emergency room 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:15.350
 37, please. 

00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:19.330
 Can I have a scan on one kfperin? 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:23.870
 Unit 37, kfperin is clean. 

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:26.010
 Thank you, 37 out. 

00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:32.200
 Then you want to talk to the person you just brought to the side, and explain why he was taken to the side. 

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:35.650
 You can do this before you check the person, but you decide this yourself. 

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:39.560
 You then decide whether to give the driver a fine or just a warning. 

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:46.450
 His driver's license can be taken for a certain time, but this depends on his past. 

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:51.410
 Only the control room can decide this. 

00:01:56.680 --> 00:02:00.430
 Hello, I just checked your past, and you're clean. 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:04.750
 I'm going to be kind, even though you've driven through the red light. 

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:06.950
 I'll give you some points on your driver's license. 

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:13.550
 If you get even more points, the third party will ensure that your driver's license is taken. 

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:16.890
 Have a nice day, and drive carefully, sir! 

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:28.770
 If the situation becomes out of control, ask for support. 

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:35.800
 What is the problem here agent? - Get back in the vehicle! 

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:43.120
 What the hell is the problem here? Tell me what the problem is! 

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:46.100
 Sir, get back in the vehicle. - It's a simple question, answer! 

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:47.550
 Get back in the vehicle! - What's the problem!? 

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:50.800
 Unit 49, so on. 

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:54.480

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:56.640
 Ok 49, just a moment. 

00:02:56.640 --> 00:03:01.960
 Unit 78, answer to help 49 1 block to the west at the fire station. 

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:25.640
 Now some tips, If you put someone aside at a busy highway, stand in a safe place. 

00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:33.390
 If shooting is required, immediately request support and seek coverage. 

00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:25.270
