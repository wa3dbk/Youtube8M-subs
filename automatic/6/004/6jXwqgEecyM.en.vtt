00:00:05.529 --> 00:00:12.800
 with the information of the banks 

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:14.330
 I'm going to show three images of guaymas 

00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:16.279
 images but I think some are not 

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:18.380
 necessary because you always see the same 

00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:20.060
 but the case is three images that are 

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:22.940
 the most interesting and it has to be the 

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:24.260
 plane inside the carrier of 

00:00:22.940 --> 00:00:26.180
 zealous they worked with vegetation with 

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:27.920
 line then it has effectively 

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:29.510
 filtering wanted to be the plane from within 

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:31.010
 how will he be what he is also 

00:00:29.510 --> 00:00:32.780
 it's inside it seems to be going to have 

00:00:31.010 --> 00:00:37.510
 three heights counting the height of 

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:37.510
 the surface what is this 

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:44.480
 because after that or be the by 

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:45.559
 he also insisted on 33 heights but 

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:47.180
 then as you already know the x 

00:00:45.559 --> 00:00:48.890
 has the control tower and clear in 

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:50.660
 all these images are all set 

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:51.980
 you have it on the floors of the tower 

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:53.540
 of total control and a lot of plants 

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:55.309
 that you simply see the plane of a 

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:56.600
 small square that of the simple tower of 

00:00:55.309 --> 00:00:58.340
 control and there you can not differentiate 

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:59.899
 nothing and as I say is a loss of type 

00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:01.760
 provided the case and it simply follows 

00:00:59.899 --> 00:01:03.620
 the three surfaces of what is the 

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:05.780
 aircraft carrier and from the bottom and 

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:07.490
 the whole subject so it is therefore the truth 

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:09.110
 is that I do not know which one on the top 

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:11.150
 and the part below but good the case 

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:12.980
 I'll leave the three images would put image 

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:15.710
 an image two images three obviously 

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:18.440
 I can not with the first image in 

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:20.360
 which, then, I have deduced that it is 

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:22.880
 the part of the surface of the whole 

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:24.290
 because then because he does not have many things 

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:26.270
 so to speak it has many walls not 

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:27.710
 it has many doors does not have many 

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:29.330
 Little things want to be the plane 

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:30.770
 So, I think that this will be the 

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:31.970
 part of the surface too much and as 

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:34.040
 things to the side he knew they will be 

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:35.810
 boxes or things of armament and all the 

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:37.340
 subject then I do not know because I have deduced 

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:38.810
 which is on the top of the whole 

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:40.460
 I think you leave what I 

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:42.259
 you want comments so nothing 

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:44.390
 Well this is the first image we're going with 

00:01:42.259 --> 00:01:46.610
 the second image and well then we are 

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:48.200
 here will be the bottom part of the whole the 

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:49.820
 in the middle I have no idea or even at 

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:51.740
 up because as I say I do not know with 

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:53.000
 confirmed if the one that I just taught in 

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:54.740
 the top part does not but the good case 

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.500
 the second image is writing 

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:59.180
 lack of the I believe that this is the second 

00:01:56.500 --> 00:02:00.380
 and I think the other one is the third one or 

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:02.570
 that I do not know very well but I think that 

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:05.060
 is in the second because they look like 

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:09.739
 two gates like this one and I tend and 

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:13.910
 come there as good rooms do not 

00:02:09.739 --> 00:02:15.350
 difference but 

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:17.420
 and this from here from side I do not know 

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:18.980
 differentiate which part is but good if 

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:21.290
 you see as a kind of means of what 

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:23.810
 is the plane you see a room that 

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:25.010
 it went to the right and I do not understand very 

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:26.390
 well what room can those be 

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:28.280
 things I do not know if not even if you can 

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:29.420
 enter even good sofÃ­a just in 

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:30.830
 the central corridor as there is a 

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:33.620
 hallway super super if you look 

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:35.090
 just above he took some that 

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:36.560
 they go a kind of black line and 

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:38.750
 down the same in black line but it's 

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:40.550
 as broken or open afterwards to the best 

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:41.870
 can be imposed with doors inside 

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:43.940
 there we have to open those floodgates 

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:45.800
 to be able to pass I do not know something about that 

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:46.940
 it seems to be so good is the second 

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:49.400
 image of the portal going inside and 

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:51.490
 we go with the third one which is this one 

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:54.470
 well, I have deduced that it can be 

00:02:51.490 --> 00:02:55.580
 the bottom part of the whole are all 

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:56.870
 the junk not because, as it is all 

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:58.550
 them from boxes all full of things 

00:02:56.870 --> 00:03:00.320
 then I knew that that will be the part 

00:02:58.550 --> 00:03:03.020
 from below where it goes by so saying little 

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:04.490
 the material not all the things that will 

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:06.710
 transporting the portal and I think 

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:08.960
 is what I deduced action nothing then 

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:10.460
 basically this is everything and also look 

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:11.840
 if you notice just this one look here 

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:14.570
 It can be because I have not just realized 

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:16.910
 of something is worth that exactly in the image 

00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:18.680
 up and down to the left 

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:19.220
 down down the left and up the 

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:20.810
 right 

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:24.319
 you can see that like two tubes 

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:26.420
 that's why I suppose they will be able to 

00:03:24.319 --> 00:03:28.190
 go out with boats 

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:29.930
 because the boats will be on board will be 

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:32.030
 as a mini port in the airplane port and 

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:34.310
 well then we can go out with that 

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:36.319
 sort of tunnel aft with our 

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:37.700
 marks towards nobody as this is known 

00:03:36.319 --> 00:03:38.989
 is everything you already know leave it without strong and 

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:40.370
 He has to leave your theories for the 

00:03:38.989 --> 00:03:42.819
 comments and nothing then see you in the 

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:42.819
 next video
