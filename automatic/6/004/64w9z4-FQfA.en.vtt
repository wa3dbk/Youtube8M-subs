of<00:00:45.050> tobor<00:00:46.050> which<00:00:46.289> was<00:00:46.500> done<00:00:46.739> and<00:00:46.860> resin<00:00:47.420> so<00:00:48.420> I

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:48.450 
of tobor which was done and resin so I

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:51.040 
of tobor which was done and resin so I
was<00:00:48.600> trying<00:00:48.750> to<00:00:48.960> come<00:00:49.350> up<00:00:49.379> with<00:00:49.500> a<00:00:49.890> version<00:00:50.820> of

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:51.050 
was trying to come up with a version of

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:54.680 
was trying to come up with a version of
die-cast<00:00:52.050> aluminum<00:00:52.949> and<00:00:53.270> I've<00:00:54.270> been<00:00:54.420> able<00:00:54.539> to

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
die-cast aluminum and I've been able to

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:58.189 
die-cast aluminum and I've been able to
do<00:00:55.199> that<00:00:55.410> in<00:00:55.710> a<00:00:55.800> good<00:00:56.010> size<00:00:56.899> here<00:00:57.899> for

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
do that in a good size here for

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:04.070 
do that in a good size here for
reference<00:00:58.410> for<00:00:59.039> scale<00:00:59.070> is<00:01:00.260> robot<00:01:01.260> V<00:01:02.809> so<00:01:03.809> it

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 
reference for scale is robot V so it

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:06.890 
reference for scale is robot V so it
actually<00:01:04.260> fits<00:01:04.769> the<00:01:05.070> scale<00:01:05.339> well<00:01:05.750> for<00:01:06.750> the

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900 
actually fits the scale well for the

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:12.649 
actually fits the scale well for the
robots<00:01:08.780> he<00:01:09.780> turned<00:01:10.049> out<00:01:10.260> very<00:01:10.650> well<00:01:11.280> I<00:01:11.880> have

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:12.659 
robots he turned out very well I have

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:17.090 
robots he turned out very well I have
clear<00:01:13.409> resin<00:01:13.860> eyes<00:01:14.390> for<00:01:15.390> him<00:01:15.659> as<00:01:15.869> well<00:01:16.409> as<00:01:16.860> the

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100 
clear resin eyes for him as well as the

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:20.480 
clear resin eyes for him as well as the
the<00:01:17.610> clear<00:01:17.939> visor<00:01:18.360> and<00:01:18.869> such<00:01:19.140> I<00:01:19.470> was<00:01:20.280> debating

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
the clear visor and such I was debating

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:26.450 
the clear visor and such I was debating
on<00:01:21.030> marketing<00:01:22.610> tobor<00:01:23.610> and<00:01:25.310> unfortunately<00:01:26.310> I'm

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 
on marketing tobor and unfortunately I'm

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:29.719 
on marketing tobor and unfortunately I'm
not<00:01:26.490> sure<00:01:26.970> just<00:01:27.630> because<00:01:28.020> this<00:01:28.860> is<00:01:29.100> there<00:01:29.549> is

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:29.729 
not sure just because this is there is

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:32.510 
not sure just because this is there is
there<00:01:29.759> was<00:01:30.030> a<00:01:30.060> lot<00:01:30.360> to<00:01:30.390> building<00:01:30.990> this<00:01:31.520> robot

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520 
there was a lot to building this robot

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:37.929 
there was a lot to building this robot
so<00:01:33.329> I'm<00:01:34.049> still<00:01:34.350> trying<00:01:34.710> to<00:01:34.770> find<00:01:35.009> out<00:01:35.250> if<00:01:35.579> I<00:01:35.909> can

00:01:37.929 --> 00:01:37.939 
so I'm still trying to find out if I can

00:01:37.939 --> 00:01:44.240 
so I'm still trying to find out if I can
market<00:01:38.939> this<00:01:39.270> robot<00:01:40.170> this<00:01:40.860> tobor<00:01:41.840> for<00:01:42.840> a<00:01:43.250> you

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250 
market this robot this tobor for a you

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:46.280 
market this robot this tobor for a you
know<00:01:44.340> a<00:01:44.369> pretty<00:01:44.880> decent<00:01:45.240> price<00:01:45.450> but<00:01:45.750> right<00:01:46.079> now

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290 
know a pretty decent price but right now

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:49.819 
know a pretty decent price but right now
it's<00:01:46.680> pretty<00:01:46.740> costly<00:01:47.369> to<00:01:47.579> manufacture<00:01:48.360> and<00:01:48.829> I

00:01:49.819 --> 00:01:49.829 
it's pretty costly to manufacture and I

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:52.999 
it's pretty costly to manufacture and I
haven't<00:01:50.369> quite<00:01:50.549> decided<00:01:51.210> if<00:01:51.720> that<00:01:52.530> will<00:01:52.799> be

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:53.009 
haven't quite decided if that will be

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:55.819 
haven't quite decided if that will be
truly<00:01:53.909> a<00:01:54.030> go<00:01:54.270> at<00:01:54.450> this<00:01:54.600> point<00:01:54.960> so<00:01:55.590> I<00:01:55.619> just

it and again compared to the 24 inch
resin<00:02:11.099> version<00:02:11.550> which<00:02:12.209> is<00:02:12.239> still<00:02:12.569> fine

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:14.660 
resin version which is still fine

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:20.150
