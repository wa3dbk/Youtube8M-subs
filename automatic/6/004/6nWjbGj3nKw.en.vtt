00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:25.859 
what I've been calling them anyway but

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:29.330 
what I've been calling them anyway but
they<00:00:25.980> are<00:00:26.070> brand<00:00:26.250> spankin<00:00:26.789> new<00:00:27.500> I<00:00:28.500> think<00:00:29.250> this

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:29.340 
they are brand spankin new I think this

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:32.740 
they are brand spankin new I think this
one<00:00:29.750> this<00:00:30.750> one<00:00:31.050> in<00:00:31.289> particular<00:00:31.560> is<00:00:32.399> the

00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:32.750 
one this one in particular is the

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:36.440 
one this one in particular is the
Chipotle<00:00:33.750> this<00:00:34.350> is<00:00:34.559> the<00:00:34.710> less<00:00:35.040> hot<00:00:35.880> of<00:00:36.149> all

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:36.450 
Chipotle this is the less hot of all

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:38.690 
Chipotle this is the less hot of all
three<00:00:36.899> but<00:00:37.469> hopefully<00:00:38.340> it'll<00:00:38.489> have<00:00:38.670> a

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:38.700 
three but hopefully it'll have a

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:40.880 
three but hopefully it'll have a
Chipotle<00:00:39.390> kind<00:00:39.660> of<00:00:39.750> smoky<00:00:40.290> taste<00:00:40.530> to<00:00:40.800> it

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890 
Chipotle kind of smoky taste to it

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:42.950 
Chipotle kind of smoky taste to it
that's<00:00:41.340> what<00:00:41.520> I'm<00:00:41.610> expecting<00:00:42.239> this<00:00:42.600> to<00:00:42.809> have

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960 
that's what I'm expecting this to have

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:45.700 
that's what I'm expecting this to have
but<00:00:43.649> you<00:00:43.800> never<00:00:43.980> know<00:00:44.100> with<00:00:44.129> these<00:00:44.280> things<00:00:44.430> so

00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:45.710 
but you never know with these things so

00:00:45.710 --> 00:01:01.380 
but you never know with these things so
hmm<00:00:46.710> let's<00:00:47.520> go<00:00:47.610> ahead<00:00:47.730> and<00:00:47.820> give<00:00:47.910> it<00:00:47.940> a<00:00:48.030> go<00:00:55.340> hmm

00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:01.390 

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:03.910 

so<00:01:02.390> much<00:01:02.539> more<00:01:02.690> flavor<00:01:02.899> in<00:01:03.260> this<00:01:03.410> one<00:01:03.590> I<00:01:03.739> mean

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:03.920 
so much more flavor in this one I mean

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:06.430 
so much more flavor in this one I mean
it<00:01:04.400> seems<00:01:04.760> like<00:01:04.909> the<00:01:05.630> hotter<00:01:05.869> it<00:01:05.990> gets<00:01:06.110> the

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:06.440 
it seems like the hotter it gets the

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:09.460 
it seems like the hotter it gets the
less<00:01:06.590> flavor<00:01:07.159> full<00:01:07.760> it<00:01:08.030> is<00:01:08.210> so<00:01:08.690> there<00:01:09.140> it<00:01:09.229> is<00:01:09.320> on

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:09.470 
less flavor full it is so there it is on

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:11.289 
less flavor full it is so there it is on
the<00:01:09.530> inside<00:01:09.770> this<00:01:10.490> one<00:01:10.640> doesn't<00:01:10.759> have<00:01:10.880> as<00:01:11.060> much

00:01:11.289 --> 00:01:11.299 
the inside this one doesn't have as much

00:01:11.299 --> 00:01:28.630 
the inside this one doesn't have as much
in<00:01:11.570> it<00:01:18.310> for<00:01:19.310> the<00:01:19.430> flavor<00:01:19.759> so<00:01:20.210> much<00:01:20.360> there<00:01:27.369> so<00:01:28.369> in

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:28.640 
in it for the flavor so much there so in

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:30.999 
in it for the flavor so much there so in
terms<00:01:29.030> of<00:01:29.180> the<00:01:29.270> heat<00:01:29.530> this<00:01:30.530> one's<00:01:30.740> going<00:01:30.950> to

00:01:30.999 --> 00:01:31.009 
terms of the heat this one's going to

00:01:31.009 --> 00:01:35.609 
terms of the heat this one's going to
get<00:01:31.310> a<00:01:31.460> one<00:01:32.830> it's<00:01:33.830> very<00:01:34.160> little<00:01:34.640> if<00:01:35.179> at<00:01:35.509> all

00:01:35.609 --> 00:01:35.619 
get a one it's very little if at all

00:01:35.619 --> 00:01:39.520 
get a one it's very little if at all
very<00:01:36.619> little<00:01:36.800> it's<00:01:37.429> like<00:01:37.550> a<00:01:37.580> low<00:01:37.850> one<00:01:38.289> so<00:01:39.289> I'm

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:39.530 
very little it's like a low one so I'm

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:41.260 
very little it's like a low one so I'm
gonna<00:01:39.710> need<00:01:39.860> to<00:01:39.979> put<00:01:40.159> some<00:01:40.340> fire<00:01:40.789> sauce<00:01:41.090> on

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:41.270 
gonna need to put some fire sauce on

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:44.889 
gonna need to put some fire sauce on
this<00:01:41.420> or<00:01:41.630> spruce<00:01:41.990> it<00:01:42.140> up<00:01:43.300> yeah<00:01:44.300> the<00:01:44.450> fire<00:01:44.630> sauce

00:01:44.889 --> 00:01:44.899 
this or spruce it up yeah the fire sauce

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:50.309 
this or spruce it up yeah the fire sauce
has<00:01:45.140> more<00:01:45.380> more<00:01:46.100> heat<00:01:46.280> than<00:01:46.490> this<00:01:47.979> so<00:01:48.979> yeah<00:01:49.310> um

00:01:50.309 --> 00:01:50.319 
has more more heat than this so yeah um

00:01:50.319 --> 00:01:52.630 
has more more heat than this so yeah um
for<00:01:51.319> heat<00:01:51.470> it's<00:01:51.649> not<00:01:51.800> that<00:01:51.950> good<00:01:52.130> but<00:01:52.429> for

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:52.640 
for heat it's not that good but for

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:56.669 
for heat it's not that good but for
flavor<00:01:52.970> damn<00:01:53.830> definitely<00:01:54.830> has<00:01:54.950> that<00:01:54.979> smoky

00:01:56.669 --> 00:01:56.679 
flavor damn definitely has that smoky

00:01:56.679 --> 00:02:00.520 
flavor damn definitely has that smoky
Chipotle<00:01:57.679> taste<00:01:57.979> to<00:01:58.159> it<00:01:58.390> um<00:01:59.390> which<00:02:00.110> is<00:02:00.289> really

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:00.530 
Chipotle taste to it um which is really

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:02.260 
Chipotle taste to it um which is really
good<00:02:00.770> for<00:02:00.950> something<00:02:01.250> like<00:02:01.340> this<00:02:01.399> I<00:02:01.789> think<00:02:02.179> it

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:02.270 
good for something like this I think it

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:06.929 
good for something like this I think it
goes<00:02:02.450> really<00:02:02.720> well<00:02:03.020> with<00:02:03.080> this<00:02:03.970> beefy<00:02:05.680> nacho

00:02:06.929 --> 00:02:06.939 
goes really well with this beefy nacho

00:02:06.939 --> 00:02:11.590 
goes really well with this beefy nacho

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:29.720 
my old friend um but it is a very high

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:32.319 
my old friend um but it is a very high
four<00:02:30.620> out<00:02:30.709> of<00:02:30.769> five<00:02:30.950> it's<00:02:31.670> about<00:02:31.760> in<00:02:32.030> the<00:02:32.120> same

00:02:32.319 --> 00:02:32.329 
four out of five it's about in the same

00:02:32.329 --> 00:02:34.000 
four out of five it's about in the same
range<00:02:32.600> as<00:02:32.780> the<00:02:32.930> habanero<00:02:33.350> but<00:02:33.620> it<00:02:33.709> does<00:02:33.829> have<00:02:33.980> a

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:34.010 
range as the habanero but it does have a

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:35.680 
range as the habanero but it does have a
little<00:02:34.220> more<00:02:34.310> flavor<00:02:34.609> I<00:02:34.820> think<00:02:35.120> I<00:02:35.239> think<00:02:35.600> the

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:35.690 
little more flavor I think I think the

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:38.110 
little more flavor I think I think the
flavor<00:02:36.049> of<00:02:36.170> this<00:02:36.350> one<00:02:36.590> just<00:02:37.280> works<00:02:37.880> a<00:02:38.000> lot

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:38.120 
flavor of this one just works a lot

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:41.170 
flavor of this one just works a lot
better<00:02:38.180> with<00:02:38.570> these<00:02:38.750> loaded<00:02:39.019> grillers<00:02:39.640> um<00:02:40.640> but

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:41.180 
better with these loaded grillers um but

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:45.430 
better with these loaded grillers um but
you<00:02:41.660> know<00:02:43.390> so<00:02:44.390> there<00:02:44.540> you<00:02:44.600> go<00:02:44.690> guys<00:02:44.780> that
