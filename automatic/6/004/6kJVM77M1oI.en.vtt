00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:43.350 
think it's orphans actually on okay then

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:45.319 
think it's orphans actually on okay then
you<00:00:43.410> have<00:00:43.530> three<00:00:43.739> channels<00:00:44.039> one<00:00:44.850> channel<00:00:45.149> 2

00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:45.329 
you have three channels one channel 2

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:48.619 
you have three channels one channel 2
channel<00:00:45.359> 3<00:00:45.899> channel<00:00:46.850> basically<00:00:47.850> each<00:00:48.120> channel

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:48.629

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320 
has two lines the first two channels you

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:55.700 
has two lines the first two channels you
can<00:00:52.350> pick<00:00:52.800> between<00:00:52.940> either<00:00:53.940> of<00:00:54.149> phone<00:00:54.570> a<00:00:54.870> phone

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
can pick between either of phone a phone

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:59.240 
can pick between either of phone a phone
a<00:00:55.769> plug<00:00:56.250> for<00:00:56.399> turntable<00:00:56.940> or<00:00:57.539> a<00:00:58.140> line<00:00:58.410> that's<00:00:59.010> on

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
a plug for turntable or a line that's on

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:01.880 
a plug for turntable or a line that's on
both<00:00:59.370> first<00:00:59.850> on<00:01:00.090> the<00:01:00.149> second<00:01:00.390> channel<00:01:00.600> on<00:01:01.589> the

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
both first on the second channel on the

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:04.100 
both first on the second channel on the
third<00:01:02.160> channel<00:01:02.640> it<00:01:02.969> can<00:01:03.000> only<00:01:03.300> treat<00:01:03.690> choose

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
third channel it can only treat choose

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:07.250 
third channel it can only treat choose
between<00:01:04.260> two<00:01:04.949> lines<00:01:05.150> so<00:01:06.150> in<00:01:06.510> total<00:01:06.810> you<00:01:07.170> can

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260 
between two lines so in total you can

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:09.790 
between two lines so in total you can
actually<00:01:07.560> use<00:01:08.040> six<00:01:08.430> devices<00:01:08.790> on<00:01:09.120> this<00:01:09.270> mixer

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:09.800 
actually use six devices on this mixer

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:12.230 
actually use six devices on this mixer
but<00:01:10.800> you<00:01:10.860> can<00:01:11.010> only<00:01:11.160> use<00:01:11.310> three<00:01:11.790> at<00:01:11.880> the<00:01:12.030> same

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
but you can only use three at the same

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:14.510 
but you can only use three at the same
time<00:01:12.510> but<00:01:12.990> you<00:01:13.140> can<00:01:13.290> connect<00:01:13.590> all<00:01:13.710> six<00:01:13.980> devices

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
time but you can connect all six devices

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:17.540 
time but you can connect all six devices
so<00:01:14.730> that<00:01:14.760> makes<00:01:15.180> it<00:01:15.360> quite<00:01:15.600> cool<00:01:15.960> for<00:01:16.830> for<00:01:17.310> the

so that makes it quite cool for for the

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:18.940 
so that makes it quite cool for for the
high<00:01:17.760> high<00:01:18.030> high<00:01:18.300> tech<00:01:18.600> and<00:01:18.840> high

choose between master and key output and

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:03.380 
choose between master and key output and
you<00:02:01.170> can<00:02:01.320> actually<00:02:01.530> use<00:02:02.070> it<00:02:02.220> to<00:02:02.460> set<00:02:02.730> your

to new cue so you can just select

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:26.410 
to new cue so you can just select
between<00:02:23.900> those<00:02:24.050> and<00:02:24.910> then<00:02:25.910> you<00:02:25.940> also<00:02:26.180> have<00:02:26.390> a

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:26.420 
between those and then you also have a

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:29.170 
between those and then you also have a
queue<00:02:26.690> volume<00:02:27.110> that's<00:02:27.500> just<00:02:27.770> for<00:02:28.460> the<00:02:28.820> volume

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:29.180 
queue volume that's just for the volume

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:31.600 
queue volume that's just for the volume
of<00:02:29.270> your<00:02:29.300> hates<00:02:29.900> it<00:02:30.080> and<00:02:30.230> then<00:02:30.920> you<00:02:31.130> selector

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:31.610 
of your hates it and then you selector
