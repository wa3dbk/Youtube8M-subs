maybe<00:01:56.650> mid<00:01:57.009> to<00:01:57.220> late<00:01:57.399> January<00:01:57.690> it's<00:01:58.690> gonna

00:01:58.770 --> 00:01:58.780 
maybe mid to late January it's gonna

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:00.090 
maybe mid to late January it's gonna
consist<00:01:58.990> of<00:01:59.229> like<00:01:59.380> three<00:01:59.619> tracks<00:01:59.920> or

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:00.100 
consist of like three tracks or

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:11.910 
consist of like three tracks or
something<00:02:00.189> like<00:02:00.399> that<00:02:10.230> we<00:02:11.230> usually<00:02:11.380> use<00:02:11.620> a

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:11.920 
something like that we usually use a

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:14.670 
something like that we usually use a
delay<00:02:12.250> on<00:02:12.580> the<00:02:12.730> Pioneer<00:02:13.239> we<00:02:14.200> just<00:02:14.380> like<00:02:14.560> the

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:14.680 
delay on the Pioneer we just like the

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:16.229 
delay on the Pioneer we just like the
way<00:02:14.770> it<00:02:14.860> feels<00:02:15.069> as<00:02:15.310> far<00:02:15.520> as<00:02:15.640> like<00:02:15.819> the<00:02:15.970> you<00:02:16.150> know

00:02:16.229 --> 00:02:16.239 
way it feels as far as like the you know

00:02:16.239 --> 00:02:18.180 
way it feels as far as like the you know
join<00:02:16.870> the<00:02:16.989> parameters<00:02:17.590> and<00:02:17.890> you<00:02:18.100> know

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:18.190 
join the parameters and you know

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:20.580 
join the parameters and you know
everything<00:02:18.610> else<00:02:18.790> the<00:02:19.660> depth<00:02:19.930> of<00:02:20.110> it<00:02:20.260> the<00:02:20.350> time

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:20.590 
everything else the depth of it the time

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:23.130 
everything else the depth of it the time
we<00:02:20.980> like<00:02:21.130> that<00:02:21.730> control<00:02:22.120> as<00:02:22.269> far<00:02:22.300> as<00:02:22.510> in<00:02:22.840> the

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:23.140 
we like that control as far as in the

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:24.750 
we like that control as far as in the
Pioneer<00:02:23.560> so<00:02:23.739> usually<00:02:24.069> the<00:02:24.220> delay<00:02:24.519> on<00:02:24.550> the

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:24.760 
Pioneer so usually the delay on the

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:27.360 
Pioneer so usually the delay on the
Pioneer<00:02:25.209> and<00:02:25.390> the<00:02:25.480> reverb<00:02:26.350> on<00:02:26.590> on<00:02:26.830> on<00:02:27.100> the<00:02:27.130> on

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:27.370 
Pioneer and the reverb on on on the on

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:36.000 
Pioneer and the reverb on on on the on
the<00:02:27.640> tractor<00:02:33.030> this<00:02:34.030> is<00:02:35.019> the<00:02:35.110> fate<00:02:35.319> of<00:02:35.350> box<00:02:35.680> this

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:36.010 
the tractor this is the fate of box this

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:38.430 
the tractor this is the fate of box this
basically<00:02:36.489> controls<00:02:36.940> you<00:02:37.840> can<00:02:37.989> control<00:02:38.230> all

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:38.440 
basically controls you can control all

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:40.440 
basically controls you can control all
my<00:02:38.590> effects<00:02:38.890> alright<00:02:39.519> you<00:02:39.610> go<00:02:39.760> down<00:02:40.030> here<00:02:40.299> you

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:40.450 
my effects alright you go down here you

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:44.670 
my effects alright you go down here you
can<00:02:40.569> see<00:02:42.690> this<00:02:43.690> can<00:02:43.870> this<00:02:44.200> right<00:02:44.380> here<00:02:44.560> can

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:44.680 
can see this can this right here can

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:47.850 
can see this can this right here can
control<00:02:45.040> the<00:02:45.280> play<00:02:45.910> that<00:02:46.150> stops<00:02:46.590> when<00:02:47.590> we<00:02:47.620> get

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:47.860 
control the play that stops when we get

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:50.970 
control the play that stops when we get
to<00:02:48.040> use<00:02:48.250> the<00:02:48.880> the<00:02:49.019> digital<00:02:50.019> program<00:02:50.650> such<00:02:50.950> as

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:50.980 
to use the the digital program such as

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:53.340 
to use the the digital program such as
factor<00:02:51.549> while<00:02:52.360> still<00:02:52.720> using<00:02:52.959> the<00:02:53.049> hardware

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:53.350 
factor while still using the hardware

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:55.319 
factor while still using the hardware
that<00:02:53.500> that<00:02:54.010> were<00:02:54.130> customers<00:02:54.549> using<00:02:54.790> a<00:02:54.940> Cassini

00:02:55.319 --> 00:02:55.329 
that that were customers using a Cassini

00:02:55.329 --> 00:02:57.960 
that that were customers using a Cassini
J's<00:02:55.540> and<00:02:55.750> the<00:02:55.840> external<00:02:56.260> mixer<00:02:56.620> it<00:02:57.610> allows<00:02:57.820> for

00:02:57.960 --> 00:02:57.970 
J's and the external mixer it allows for

00:02:57.970 --> 00:03:00.479 
J's and the external mixer it allows for
a<00:02:58.030> lot<00:02:58.120> of<00:02:58.239> flexibility<00:02:58.859> we<00:02:59.859> can<00:02:59.980> use<00:03:00.100> effects

00:03:00.479 --> 00:03:00.489 
a lot of flexibility we can use effects

00:03:00.489 --> 00:03:02.910 
a lot of flexibility we can use effects
from<00:03:00.730> back<00:03:01.000> there

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:02.920 
from back there

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:10.290 
from back there
oh<00:03:08.040> we<00:03:09.040> still<00:03:09.250> mining<00:03:09.640> stuff<00:03:09.849> and<00:03:10.000> we're<00:03:10.090> still

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:10.300 
oh we still mining stuff and we're still

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:12.479 
oh we still mining stuff and we're still
designing<00:03:10.720> things<00:03:10.900> you<00:03:11.709> know<00:03:11.800> I'm<00:03:11.890> just<00:03:12.010> know

00:03:12.479 --> 00:03:12.489 
designing things you know I'm just know

00:03:12.489 --> 00:03:14.100 
designing things you know I'm just know
practice<00:03:12.970> makes<00:03:13.000> perfect<00:03:13.330> you<00:03:13.599> don't<00:03:13.660> think

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:14.110 
practice makes perfect you don't think

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:14.640 
practice makes perfect you don't think
so

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:14.650 
so

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:17.460 
so

00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:17.470 
what you love you know just keep active

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:28.590 
what you love you know just keep active

like oh man I think I miss playing
records<00:03:47.319> but<00:03:47.410> when<00:03:47.530> they<00:03:47.620> sit<00:03:47.680> behind<00:03:48.040> the

00:03:48.270 --> 00:03:48.280 
records but when they sit behind the

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:49.949 
records but when they sit behind the
decks<00:03:48.459> and<00:03:48.610> actually<00:03:49.060> see<00:03:49.269> what<00:03:49.390> it<00:03:49.480> takes<00:03:49.750> to

00:03:49.949 --> 00:03:49.959 
decks and actually see what it takes to

00:03:49.959 --> 00:03:52.080 
decks and actually see what it takes to
do<00:03:50.140> to<00:03:50.410> do<00:03:50.590> what<00:03:50.739> we<00:03:50.860> do<00:03:51.040> again<00:03:51.519> I<00:03:51.700> think<00:03:51.819> I

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:52.090 
do to do what we do again I think I

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:55.049 
do to do what we do again I think I
think<00:03:52.239> they'll<00:03:52.330> appreciate<00:03:52.630> it
