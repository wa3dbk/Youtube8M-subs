00:00:05.530 --> 00:00:11.381
 Let's put our attention in the eyes of the model. As they are, they seem rather subdued. 

00:00:11.381 --> 00:00:19.774
 The eyes are the most important part of the face, especially for the cover of a magazine, so let's cheer them up a bit. 

00:00:19.774 --> 00:00:25.722
 We begin by making a selection of the eyes. Now, you may remember that when we selected the hair, 

00:00:25.722 --> 00:00:33.664
 we use the Quick Mask to make our selection, and as the Quick Mask paints a mask, then we had to convert the selection. 

00:00:33.664 --> 00:00:45.053
 We can correct this by double clicking on the Quick Mask icon and changing the way it passes from Masked Areas to Selected Areas. 

00:00:45.053 --> 00:01:01.536
 The area we painted in Quick Mask will be selected when we exit in this way. We give OK. We change back to the Brush tool. 

00:01:01.536 --> 00:01:14.258
 We go to Quick Mask mode and we can paint the area that covers the entire eye in black and that we also have on the eyebrow. 

00:01:14.258 --> 00:01:29.905
 We do the same in the other eye. We can hit the Q once again by exiting the Quick Mask mode, and here we have our selection. 

00:01:29.905 --> 00:01:39.518
 To make a new layer of this, we can go to the "face" layer and we can give Command J or Control J to create a new layer. 

00:01:39.518 --> 00:01:44.847
 But if we do so, what happens is that we make a new layer 

00:01:44.847 --> 00:01:53.180
 but it includes that surface blur and it is not what we want, because it makes the eyes too soft. 

00:01:53.180 --> 00:02:07.304
 We undo that. Here we have our new selection. All we have to do is deselect Smart Filters, and now we do Command J or Control J. 

00:02:07.304 --> 00:02:15.280
 Here we have the eyes without the intelligent filter and if we give the click we see them again. 

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:33.409
 We call this layer "eyes" and we move to the top layer and that's fine, so we start with the irises. They are also quite muted. 

00:02:33.409 --> 00:02:48.408
 We change to the Overexpose tool and with a small brush set in half tones, we paint over the irises to illuminate them a little. 

00:02:48.408 --> 00:03:00.968
 This is one and this is the other. And it is already getting much better. We can look at the whites of our eyes again. 

00:03:00.968 --> 00:03:12.148
 You see that in the corners they are in shadow, where we can paint again with the tool Overexpose and give them more brightness. 

00:03:12.148 --> 00:03:22.519
 And so we will give the eyes a much more attractive look. Let's raise the tone to the color of the eye a bit. 

00:03:22.519 --> 00:03:28.501
 Just below the Overexpose tool is the Sponge tool; a tool with a funny name. 

00:03:28.501 --> 00:03:35.110
 The normal way of working is Desaturate, but we can change to Saturate. 

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:52.508
 And now when we paint over the irises, they have more color and look much better. 

00:03:52.508 --> 00:04:05.699
 So our next step is to put more tabs. We go to New layer and call it "tabs". 

00:04:05.699 --> 00:04:17.637
 I'm going to zoom in at 100 percent and that way we can paint. We return to the Brush tool and choose a very small one. 

00:04:17.637 --> 00:04:30.359
 We reduce this to a small size, over three pixels, and we take a color sample from one of the tabs here, 

00:04:30.359 --> 00:04:46.712
 we give the options key on the Mac; Alt on the PC, we take the color on this eyelid as a sample and begin to paint lashes. 

00:04:46.712 --> 00:05:09.569
 Raising the brush of the tablet like this, it diminishes the opacity when we paint, so the eyelashes go off slowly as we move around the tablet. 

00:05:09.569 --> 00:05:31.051
 We are going to put a pair on the eyelid above, between the gaps between the lashes, and we move to the other eye. 

00:05:31.051 --> 00:05:41.569
 Now it is important to keep the irregularity a bit. Do not make them all as long. This may be too long. 

00:05:41.569 --> 00:05:59.045
 But mix long with short because that way they look more real lashes; and again; also on the upper eyelid. 

00:05:59.045 --> 00:06:12.916
 Here you have our eyelashes. A few more in the right eye; the left eye as we see. 

00:06:12.916 --> 00:06:18.692
 And so they are a little better, but they seem a bit artificial, because they are too strong. 

00:06:18.692 --> 00:06:30.005
 Let's soften them up a bit using a little blur. We go to Filter&gt; Blur and Gaussian Blur. 

00:06:30.005 --> 00:06:36.374
 If we start with a lot of blurring, we see that it blurs them too much. 

00:06:36.374 --> 00:06:45.386
 We can use the cursor keys to lower the radius and it will decrease in increments of one pixel. 

00:06:45.386 --> 00:06:50.271
 With a radius of one pixel, it is still too out of focus. 

00:06:50.271 --> 00:07:03.724
 We reduce it to 0.7 pixels and this causes the effect we are looking for. We give OK. 

00:07:03.724 --> 00:07:14.643
 So this is how I was before I adjusted my eyes and here after; a significant improvement. 

00:07:14.643 --> 00:07:29.089
 Now that we are here, we are going to see the eyebrows. We can darken them to make them stronger, so this time we use the Underexpose tool. 

00:07:29.089 --> 00:07:40.504
 We change to the eye layer and paint over the eyebrows to darken these midtones. 

00:07:40.504 --> 00:07:57.341
 Now we move to the other one and it's much better. We move away a little. These are our finished eyes. 

00:07:57.341 --> 00:08:13.000
 Again, that's how it was before, and here we have the photo with darkened eyebrows, and improved eyes; a much better appearance.
