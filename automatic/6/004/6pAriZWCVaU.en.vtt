00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:27.330 
of the ramp or just around this location

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:29.359 
of the ramp or just around this location
and<00:00:27.420> have<00:00:28.019> the<00:00:28.199> stalkers<00:00:28.619> and<00:00:28.650> century<00:00:29.070> shoot

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:29.369 
and have the stalkers and century shoot

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:32.359 
and have the stalkers and century shoot
at<00:00:29.609> the<00:00:29.820> potential<00:00:30.410> supply<00:00:31.410> people<00:00:31.800> or<00:00:32.009> the

00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:32.369 
at the potential supply people or the

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:34.850 
at the potential supply people or the
add-on<00:00:32.759> and<00:00:33.030> the<00:00:33.239> barracks<00:00:33.719> over<00:00:33.989> here<00:00:34.410> that's

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:34.860 
add-on and the barracks over here that's

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:36.620 
add-on and the barracks over here that's
why<00:00:35.010> a<00:00:35.040> lot<00:00:35.100> of<00:00:35.280> players<00:00:35.550> especially<00:00:36.030> Terran

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:36.630 
why a lot of players especially Terran

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:38.090 
why a lot of players especially Terran
and<00:00:36.780> Protoss<00:00:37.050> don't<00:00:37.290> want<00:00:37.469> a<00:00:37.559> wall<00:00:37.710> in<00:00:37.890> and

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:38.100 
and Protoss don't want a wall in and

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:40.010 
and Protoss don't want a wall in and
especially<00:00:39.090> for<00:00:39.420> the<00:00:39.540> Protoss<00:00:39.840> player

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:40.020 
especially for the Protoss player

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:42.319 
especially for the Protoss player
because<00:00:40.320> the<00:00:40.530> Terran<00:00:40.770> player<00:00:41.059> does<00:00:42.059> have<00:00:42.300> a

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:42.329 
because the Terran player does have a

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:44.869 
because the Terran player does have a
lot<00:00:42.600> of<00:00:42.629> range<00:00:43.110> for<00:00:43.469> instance<00:00:44.010> the<00:00:44.129> marine<00:00:44.670> and

00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:44.879 
lot of range for instance the marine and

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:46.520 
lot of range for instance the marine and
Marauder<00:00:45.239> one<00:00:45.570> of<00:00:45.629> the<00:00:45.719> first<00:00:45.960> two<00:00:46.140> units<00:00:46.410> in

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
Marauder one of the first two units in

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:48.080 
Marauder one of the first two units in
the<00:00:46.680> game<00:00:46.890> will<00:00:47.070> be<00:00:47.160> able<00:00:47.219> to<00:00:47.370> knock<00:00:47.579> down<00:00:47.610> that

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:48.090 
the game will be able to knock down that

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:50.000 
the game will be able to knock down that
gateway<00:00:48.420> and<00:00:48.780> pylon<00:00:49.170> really<00:00:49.530> really<00:00:49.770> fast

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010 
gateway and pylon really really fast

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:53.090 
gateway and pylon really really fast
very<00:00:50.370> very<00:00:50.690> early<00:00:51.690> and<00:00:51.840> we<00:00:52.260> do<00:00:52.440> see<00:00:52.620> cloud<00:00:52.860> is

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
very very early and we do see cloud is

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:55.490 
very very early and we do see cloud is
going<00:00:53.309> to<00:00:53.370> be<00:00:53.460> scouting<00:00:54.090> with<00:00:54.239> his<00:00:54.390> SUV<00:00:54.780> and<00:00:55.079> he

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:21.689 
immediately on the gas and cloud does

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:23.570 
immediately on the gas and cloud does
the<00:01:21.810> same<00:01:21.960> thing<00:01:22.140> with<00:01:22.470> his<00:01:22.710> gas<00:01:22.950> line<00:01:23.220> as<00:01:23.400> well

the same thing with his gas line as well
we<00:01:24.299> do<00:01:24.479> see<00:01:24.720> one<00:01:25.080> barracks<00:01:25.500> only<00:01:25.920> and<00:01:26.130> a<00:01:26.400> cyber

built very very close some players do

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:53.210 
built very very close some players do
like<00:01:51.119> to<00:01:51.270> build<00:01:51.450> very<00:01:51.720> very<00:01:51.930> compactly<00:01:52.770> around

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:53.220 
like to build very very compactly around

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:54.649 
like to build very very compactly around
the<00:01:53.369> base<00:01:53.490> because<00:01:53.820> this<00:01:54.000> will<00:01:54.119> allow<00:01:54.390> them<00:01:54.509> to

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:54.659 
the base because this will allow them to

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:57.050 
the base because this will allow them to
have<00:01:54.689> fewer<00:01:55.530> points<00:01:55.829> to<00:01:56.130> Gore<00:01:56.399> should<00:01:56.939> the

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.060 
have fewer points to Gore should the

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:58.459 
have fewer points to Gore should the
game<00:01:57.270> last<00:01:57.479> a<00:01:57.719> little<00:01:57.810> bit<00:01:57.899> longer<00:01:58.140> because

00:01:58.459 --> 00:01:58.469 
game last a little bit longer because

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:02.359 
game last a little bit longer because
usually<00:01:58.829> end<00:01:59.310> longer<00:01:59.759> games<00:02:00.320> it<00:02:01.320> comes<00:02:02.040> really

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:02.369 
usually end longer games it comes really

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:04.190 
usually end longer games it comes really
hard<00:02:02.670> to<00:02:02.790> guard<00:02:02.969> all<00:02:03.270> of<00:02:03.420> your<00:02:03.540> bases<00:02:03.930> but<00:02:04.049> if

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:04.200 
hard to guard all of your bases but if

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:06.260 
hard to guard all of your bases but if
your<00:02:04.320> bases<00:02:04.890> are<00:02:05.009> really<00:02:05.340> concentrated<00:02:06.119> and

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:06.270 
your bases are really concentrated and

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:07.910 
your bases are really concentrated and
close<00:02:06.479> together<00:02:06.689> it<00:02:07.049> becomes<00:02:07.140> a<00:02:07.409> little<00:02:07.829> bit

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:07.920 
close together it becomes a little bit

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:09.830 
close together it becomes a little bit
easier<00:02:08.369> but<00:02:08.580> that's<00:02:08.729> just<00:02:08.910> in<00:02:09.149> the<00:02:09.270> long

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:09.840 
easier but that's just in the long

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:11.990 
easier but that's just in the long
my<00:02:10.080> belief<00:02:10.379> and<00:02:10.649> we<00:02:11.190> do<00:02:11.340> siebie<00:02:11.610> second

I think what cloud is going to be going
for<00:02:56.190> and<00:02:57.079> the<00:02:58.079> probe<00:02:58.739> is<00:02:59.010> dancing<00:02:59.400> back<00:02:59.610> and

these ella might be thinking about

00:03:44.069 --> 00:03:46.250 
opponent we will see one reaper on the
way<00:03:44.250> as<00:03:44.489> that<00:03:44.819> factory<00:03:45.269> is<00:03:45.569> being<00:03:45.930> constructed

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:46.260 
way as that factory is being constructed

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:48.409 
way as that factory is being constructed
as<00:03:46.739> well<00:03:47.069> so<00:03:47.609> i<00:03:47.639> thought<00:03:47.970> this<00:03:48.090> was<00:03:48.269> going<00:03:48.359> to

00:03:48.409 --> 00:03:48.419 
as well so i thought this was going to

00:03:48.419 --> 00:03:50.240 
as well so i thought this was going to
be<00:03:48.480> a<00:03:48.540> very<00:03:48.630> heavy<00:03:48.959> inventory<00:03:49.500> bill<00:03:49.680> but<00:03:50.220> i

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:50.250 
be a very heavy inventory bill but i

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:51.740 
be a very heavy inventory bill but i
think<00:03:50.669> he<00:03:50.880> might<00:03:51.090> be<00:03:51.120> thinking<00:03:51.239> about<00:03:51.510> getting

00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:51.750 
think he might be thinking about getting

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:54.409 
think he might be thinking about getting
some<00:03:52.049> additional<00:03:52.680> stuff<00:03:53.040> as<00:03:53.400> we<00:03:53.760> see<00:03:53.970> sock<00:03:54.239> is

00:03:54.409 --> 00:03:54.419 
some additional stuff as we see sock is

00:03:54.419 --> 00:03:56.690 
some additional stuff as we see sock is
going<00:03:54.900> to<00:03:55.079> move<00:03:55.230> out<00:03:55.470> with<00:03:55.680> one<00:03:55.919> pile<00:03:56.130> on<00:03:56.250> this

00:03:56.690 --> 00:03:56.700 
going to move out with one pile on this

00:03:56.700 --> 00:03:58.370 
going to move out with one pile on this
violent<00:03:57.030> will<00:03:57.120> allow<00:03:57.299> the<00:03:57.359> reinforces<00:03:58.049> troops

00:03:58.370 --> 00:03:58.380 
violent will allow the reinforces troops

00:03:58.380 --> 00:04:00.229 
violent will allow the reinforces troops
a<00:03:58.500> little<00:03:58.829> bit<00:03:58.919> easier<00:03:59.250> as<00:03:59.609> he<00:03:59.730> does<00:03:59.880> have<00:04:00.060> one

00:04:00.229 --> 00:04:00.239 
a little bit easier as he does have one

00:04:00.239 --> 00:04:02.270 
a little bit easier as he does have one
pilot<00:04:00.540> over<00:04:00.780> here<00:04:00.989> so<00:04:01.109> we<00:04:01.230> can<00:04:01.319> warp<00:04:01.859> troops<00:04:02.099> in

00:04:02.270 --> 00:04:02.280
