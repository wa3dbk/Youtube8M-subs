00:00:01.300 --> 00:00:05.019 

right<00:00:02.300> then<00:00:02.480> this<00:00:02.720> is<00:00:02.780> the<00:00:03.290> the<00:00:04.160> old<00:00:04.339> belt<00:00:04.669> and

00:00:05.019 --> 00:00:05.029 
right then this is the the old belt and

00:00:05.029 --> 00:00:09.009 
right then this is the the old belt and
as<00:00:05.180> you<00:00:05.390> can<00:00:05.539> see<00:00:05.600> as<00:00:07.690> there's<00:00:08.690> a<00:00:08.750> lot<00:00:08.870> of

00:00:09.009 --> 00:00:09.019 
as you can see as there's a lot of

00:00:09.019 --> 00:00:13.110 
as you can see as there's a lot of
cracks<00:00:09.290> in<00:00:09.559> that<00:00:10.509> he's<00:00:11.509> better<00:00:11.780> in<00:00:11.870> that<00:00:12.110> light

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:13.120 
cracks in that he's better in that light

00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:18.940 
cracks in that he's better in that light
but<00:00:14.410> that's<00:00:15.410> pretty<00:00:15.709> bad<00:00:15.980> and<00:00:16.570> that<00:00:17.570> belt<00:00:17.950> had

00:00:18.940 --> 00:00:18.950 
but that's pretty bad and that belt had

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:21.880 
but that's pretty bad and that belt had
stretched<00:00:19.370> about<00:00:19.670> ten<00:00:20.120> mil<00:00:20.390> extra<00:00:21.200> so<00:00:21.680> that

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:21.890 
stretched about ten mil extra so that

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:24.220 
stretched about ten mil extra so that
does<00:00:22.070> take<00:00:22.280> a<00:00:22.310> lot<00:00:22.520> of<00:00:22.580> the<00:00:22.700> tension<00:00:23.150> off<00:00:23.270> so

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:24.230 
does take a lot of the tension off so

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:26.320 
does take a lot of the tension off so
the<00:00:24.500> tension<00:00:24.740> it<00:00:25.010> was<00:00:25.130> pretty<00:00:25.400> much<00:00:25.580> where<00:00:26.270> it

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:26.330 
the tension it was pretty much where it

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:28.870 
the tension it was pretty much where it
was<00:00:26.420> past<00:00:26.690> its<00:00:26.930> maximum<00:00:27.530> stage<00:00:27.860> so<00:00:28.580> it<00:00:28.730> was

00:00:28.870 --> 00:00:28.880 
was past its maximum stage so it was

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:30.940 
was past its maximum stage so it was
flapping<00:00:29.360> around<00:00:29.450> on<00:00:29.840> there<00:00:30.140> and<00:00:30.590> I've<00:00:30.710> been

00:00:30.940 --> 00:00:30.950 
flapping around on there and I've been

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:34.450 
flapping around on there and I've been
using<00:00:31.160> that<00:00:32.500> sticky<00:00:33.500> stuff<00:00:33.530> to<00:00:33.980> stop<00:00:34.160> the<00:00:34.280> belt

00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:34.460 
using that sticky stuff to stop the belt

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:36.190 
using that sticky stuff to stop the belt
from<00:00:34.610> slipping<00:00:35.180> when<00:00:35.210> I<00:00:35.390> did<00:00:35.600> do<00:00:35.810> that<00:00:36.050> but

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:36.200 
from slipping when I did do that but

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:39.069 
from slipping when I did do that but
then<00:00:36.290> it<00:00:36.410> was<00:00:36.530> still<00:00:36.770> was<00:00:37.810> slapping<00:00:38.810> against

00:00:39.069 --> 00:00:39.079 
then it was still was slapping against

00:00:39.079 --> 00:00:41.080 
then it was still was slapping against
the<00:00:39.350> tensioner<00:00:40.160> so<00:00:40.310> that<00:00:40.460> was<00:00:40.610> making<00:00:40.850> the

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:41.090 
the tensioner so that was making the

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:43.180 
the tensioner so that was making the
rattling<00:00:41.420> noise<00:00:41.600> but<00:00:42.410> anyway<00:00:42.740> the<00:00:42.860> job's<00:00:43.100> done

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:43.190 
rattling noise but anyway the job's done

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:47.110 
rattling noise but anyway the job's done
so<00:00:43.840> 25<00:00:44.840> quid<00:00:45.079> for<00:00:45.260> the<00:00:45.350> belt<00:00:45.820> if<00:00:46.820> it<00:00:46.940> had<00:00:47.030> gone

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:47.120 
so 25 quid for the belt if it had gone

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:49.180 
so 25 quid for the belt if it had gone
to<00:00:47.329> a<00:00:47.360> garage<00:00:47.630> they<00:00:48.350> would<00:00:48.500> had<00:00:48.650> to<00:00:48.680> put<00:00:48.950> a<00:00:48.980> new

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:49.190 
to a garage they would had to put a new

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:50.560 
to a garage they would had to put a new
tensioner<00:00:49.670> on<00:00:49.760> that's<00:00:50.000> just<00:00:50.180> what<00:00:50.300> they<00:00:50.420> have

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:50.570 
tensioner on that's just what they have

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:53.200 
tensioner on that's just what they have
to<00:00:50.750> do<00:00:51.370> so<00:00:52.370> they<00:00:52.489> would<00:00:52.520> have<00:00:52.700> spent<00:00:52.850> eighty

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:53.210 
to do so they would have spent eighty

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:55.389 
to do so they would have spent eighty
five<00:00:53.540> quid<00:00:53.780> for<00:00:53.899> that<00:00:54.079> and<00:00:54.350> then<00:00:54.500> 25<00:00:54.980> for<00:00:55.310> the

00:00:55.389 --> 00:00:55.399 
five quid for that and then 25 for the

00:00:55.399 --> 00:00:58.180 
five quid for that and then 25 for the
belts<00:00:56.030> that's<00:00:56.270> 110<00:00:56.930> and<00:00:57.140> then<00:00:57.649> whatever<00:00:57.860> their

00:00:58.180 --> 00:00:58.190 
belts that's 110 and then whatever their

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:00.280 
belts that's 110 and then whatever their
hourly<00:00:58.570> rate<00:00:59.570> is<00:00:59.600> I<00:00:59.899> would<00:01:00.050> have<00:01:00.110> thought

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:00.290 
hourly rate is I would have thought

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:03.220 
hourly rate is I would have thought
their<00:01:00.530> charge<00:01:00.860> here<00:01:01.250> and<00:01:01.730> now<00:01:02.630> we're<00:01:02.870> probably

00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:03.230 
their charge here and now we're probably

00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:05.889 
their charge here and now we're probably
most<00:01:03.680> garages<00:01:04.219> do<00:01:04.489> but<00:01:04.909> some<00:01:05.569> of<00:01:05.689> them<00:01:05.780> are

00:01:05.889 --> 00:01:05.899 
most garages do but some of them are

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:08.499 
most garages do but some of them are
probably<00:01:06.200> do<00:01:06.499> you<00:01:06.799> half<00:01:07.520> an<00:01:07.729> hour's<00:01:07.999> break<00:01:08.270> for

00:01:08.499 --> 00:01:08.509 
probably do you half an hour's break for

00:01:08.509 --> 00:01:10.620 
probably do you half an hour's break for
that<00:01:08.659> but<00:01:09.259> yes<00:01:09.439> so<00:01:09.679> you<00:01:09.740> still<00:01:10.159> looking<00:01:10.399> around

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:10.630 
that but yes so you still looking around

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:15.069 
that but yes so you still looking around
150<00:01:11.630> 160<00:01:12.409> quid<00:01:12.889> just<00:01:13.069> to<00:01:13.639> get<00:01:13.819> that<00:01:14.479> done<00:01:14.810> and

00:01:15.069 --> 00:01:15.079 
150 160 quid just to get that done and

00:01:15.079 --> 00:01:17.349 
150 160 quid just to get that done and
let's<00:01:15.469> be<00:01:15.619> honest<00:01:15.950> it's<00:01:16.459> an<00:01:16.639> easy<00:01:16.789> little<00:01:16.999> job

00:01:17.349 --> 00:01:17.359 
let's be honest it's an easy little job

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:20.319 
let's be honest it's an easy little job
I<00:01:17.600> would<00:01:18.319> probably<00:01:18.530> have<00:01:18.770> a<00:01:18.799> go<00:01:18.979> yourself<00:01:19.329> but

00:01:20.319 --> 00:01:20.329 
I would probably have a go yourself but

00:01:20.329 --> 00:01:24.219 
I would probably have a go yourself but
main<00:01:20.780> thing<00:01:21.049> is<00:01:21.289> make<00:01:21.740> sure<00:01:21.770> that<00:01:22.929> you<00:01:23.929> put<00:01:24.139> the

00:01:24.219 --> 00:01:24.229 
main thing is make sure that you put the

00:01:24.229 --> 00:01:27.279 
main thing is make sure that you put the
belt<00:01:24.380> on<00:01:24.560> right<00:01:24.590> and<00:01:25.479> also<00:01:26.479> before<00:01:26.990> you<00:01:27.109> take

00:01:27.279 --> 00:01:27.289 
belt on right and also before you take

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:30.099 
belt on right and also before you take
the<00:01:27.380> belt<00:01:27.560> off<00:01:27.770> more<00:01:28.219> importantly<00:01:28.759> to<00:01:29.109> mention

00:01:30.099 --> 00:01:30.109 
the belt off more importantly to mention

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:33.069 
the belt off more importantly to mention
make<00:01:30.709> sure<00:01:31.039> you<00:01:31.579> draw<00:01:31.850> a<00:01:31.880> little<00:01:32.029> map<00:01:32.359> of<00:01:32.569> how

00:01:33.069 --> 00:01:33.079 
make sure you draw a little map of how

00:01:33.079 --> 00:01:35.469 
make sure you draw a little map of how
it<00:01:33.259> goes<00:01:33.469> and<00:01:33.889> which<00:01:34.670> way<00:01:34.880> the<00:01:35.060> teeth<00:01:35.270> are

00:01:35.469 --> 00:01:35.479 
it goes and which way the teeth are

00:01:35.479 --> 00:01:39.190 
it goes and which way the teeth are
facing<00:01:35.689> or<00:01:36.649> the<00:01:36.829> grooves<00:01:37.100> sorry<00:01:37.459> so<00:01:38.119> you<00:01:38.600> know

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:39.200 
facing or the grooves sorry so you know

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:41.889 
facing or the grooves sorry so you know
you<00:01:39.259> which<00:01:39.920> way<00:01:40.100> to<00:01:40.159> put<00:01:40.340> it<00:01:40.459> on<00:01:40.579> because<00:01:41.060> trust

00:01:41.889 --> 00:01:41.899 
you which way to put it on because trust

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:44.739 
you which way to put it on because trust
me<00:01:42.189> even<00:01:43.189> when<00:01:43.310> you've<00:01:43.459> got<00:01:43.700> the<00:01:43.939> map<00:01:44.119> it<00:01:44.389> still

00:01:44.739 --> 00:01:44.749 
me even when you've got the map it still

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:47.019 
me even when you've got the map it still
looks<00:01:44.959> a<00:01:45.109> little<00:01:45.229> bit<00:01:45.499> a<00:01:45.950> little<00:01:46.520> bit<00:01:46.759> fiddly

00:01:47.019 --> 00:01:47.029 
looks a little bit a little bit fiddly

00:01:47.029 --> 00:01:49.179 
looks a little bit a little bit fiddly
anyway<00:01:47.869> there<00:01:48.049> you<00:01:48.139> go<00:01:48.319> hope<00:01:48.649> it's<00:01:48.979> bigger

00:01:49.179 --> 00:01:49.189 
anyway there you go hope it's bigger

00:01:49.189 --> 00:01:53.499 
anyway there you go hope it's bigger
help<00:01:49.639> for<00:01:49.849> some<00:01:50.060> people<00:01:51.939> but<00:01:52.939> I<00:01:53.209> would<00:01:53.359> have

00:01:53.499 --> 00:01:53.509 
help for some people but I would have

00:01:53.509 --> 00:01:54.940 
help for some people but I would have
thought<00:01:53.539> some<00:01:53.959> other<00:01:54.109> people<00:01:54.469> will<00:01:54.649> have<00:01:54.799> to

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:54.950 
thought some other people will have to

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:56.529 
thought some other people will have to
change<00:01:55.219> the<00:01:55.369> tension<00:01:55.789> as<00:01:55.909> they<00:01:56.060> do<00:01:56.119> go

00:01:56.529 --> 00:01:56.539 
change the tension as they do go

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:59.529 
change the tension as they do go
bearings<00:01:57.529> go<00:01:57.799> even<00:01:58.490> alternative<00:01:59.029> bearings<00:01:59.329> go

00:01:59.529 --> 00:01:59.539 
bearings go even alternative bearings go

00:01:59.539 --> 00:02:04.569 
bearings go even alternative bearings go
but<00:02:00.279> anyway<00:02:01.279> thanks<00:02:01.669> for<00:02:01.700> watching<00:02:01.789> just
