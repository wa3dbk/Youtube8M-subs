get fluoride treatments where they

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:58.010 
get fluoride treatments where they
literally<00:00:57.000> would<00:00:57.180> put<00:00:57.420> the<00:00:57.510> fluoride<00:00:57.899> in

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020 
literally would put the fluoride in

00:00:58.020 --> 00:00:59.599 
literally would put the fluoride in
these<00:00:58.140> like<00:00:58.289> mouth<00:00:58.590> guards<00:00:58.949> pop<00:00:59.219> into<00:00:59.520> our

00:00:59.599 --> 00:00:59.609 
these like mouth guards pop into our

that's<00:01:43.890> because<00:01:44.369> it's<00:01:44.670> a<00:01:44.850> toxin<00:01:45.390> links<00:01:46.020> to<00:01:46.140> my

below<00:01:47.939> now<00:01:48.180> I'm<00:01:48.689> particularly<00:01:49.229> concerned<00:01:49.470> for

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:50.040 
below now I'm particularly concerned for

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:51.499 
below now I'm particularly concerned for
children<00:01:50.520> because<00:01:50.939> you<00:01:50.970> think<00:01:51.180> about<00:01:51.420> it

00:01:51.499 --> 00:01:51.509 
children because you think about it

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:52.670 
children because you think about it
they're<00:01:51.659> brushing<00:01:51.899> their<00:01:52.020> teeth<00:01:52.110> a<00:01:52.409> couple

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:52.680 
they're brushing their teeth a couple

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:54.590 
they're brushing their teeth a couple
times<00:01:52.829> a<00:01:52.950> day<00:01:53.119> getting<00:01:54.119> that<00:01:54.210> fluoride<00:01:54.479> in

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:54.600 
times a day getting that fluoride in

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:55.069 
times a day getting that fluoride in
their<00:01:54.720> mouths

00:01:55.069 --> 00:01:55.079 
their mouths

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:57.380 
their mouths
kids<00:01:55.470> swallow<00:01:56.159> things<00:01:56.520> so<00:01:56.939> you<00:01:57.000> know<00:01:57.090> that

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.390 
kids swallow things so you know that

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:58.580 
kids swallow things so you know that
they're<00:01:57.509> swallowing<00:01:57.810> some<00:01:58.170> of<00:01:58.259> that<00:01:58.320> stuff

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:58.590 
they're swallowing some of that stuff

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:00.380 
they're swallowing some of that stuff
plus<00:01:59.189> they're<00:01:59.399> drinking<00:01:59.759> 8<00:01:59.909> cups<00:02:00.210> of

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:00.390 
plus they're drinking 8 cups of

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:02.719 
plus they're drinking 8 cups of
fluoridated<00:02:00.930> water<00:02:00.960> every<00:02:01.500> day<00:02:01.530> this<00:02:02.159> can<00:02:02.430> add

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:02.729 
fluoridated water every day this can add

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:05.450 
fluoridated water every day this can add
up<00:02:03.000> and<00:02:03.180> cost<00:02:03.270> problems<00:02:04.200> and<00:02:04.469> the<00:02:04.950> problem<00:02:05.280> is

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:05.460 
up and cost problems and the problem is

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:07.370 
up and cost problems and the problem is
things<00:02:05.670> like<00:02:05.820> a<00:02:05.939> Brita<00:02:06.270> water<00:02:06.360> filter<00:02:06.659> that

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:07.380 
things like a Brita water filter that

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:08.869 
things like a Brita water filter that
doesn't<00:02:07.829> take<00:02:07.979> out<00:02:08.099> fluoride<00:02:08.520> in<00:02:08.700> our<00:02:08.819> water

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:08.879 
doesn't take out fluoride in our water

00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:10.520 
doesn't take out fluoride in our water
it's<00:02:09.300> very<00:02:09.390> difficult<00:02:10.020> to<00:02:10.140> get<00:02:10.229> rid<00:02:10.500> of

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:10.530 
it's very difficult to get rid of

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:12.589 
it's very difficult to get rid of
fluoride<00:02:10.920> in<00:02:11.039> the<00:02:11.340> water<00:02:11.370> so<00:02:12.239> what<00:02:12.360> you<00:02:12.480> can

00:02:12.589 --> 00:02:12.599 
fluoride in the water so what you can

00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:13.640 
fluoride in the water so what you can
use<00:02:12.720> instead<00:02:13.020> is

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:13.650 
use instead is

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:15.289 
use instead is
water<00:02:13.950> that's<00:02:14.220> an<00:02:14.370> excellent<00:02:14.849> source<00:02:15.090> it's

00:02:15.289 --> 00:02:15.299 
water that's an excellent source it's

00:02:15.299 --> 00:02:16.699 
water that's an excellent source it's
usually<00:02:15.450> very<00:02:15.900> low<00:02:16.140> and<00:02:16.319> naturally<00:02:16.650> occurring

00:02:16.699 --> 00:02:16.709 
usually very low and naturally occurring

00:02:16.709 --> 00:02:18.619 
usually very low and naturally occurring
fluoride<00:02:17.129> another<00:02:18.030> thing<00:02:18.180> you<00:02:18.269> can<00:02:18.390> do<00:02:18.510> is

00:02:18.619 --> 00:02:18.629 
fluoride another thing you can do is

00:02:18.629 --> 00:02:21.110 
fluoride another thing you can do is
find<00:02:18.840> special<00:02:19.319> water<00:02:19.560> filters<00:02:20.010> that<00:02:20.250> take<00:02:20.909> out

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:21.120 
find special water filters that take out

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:23.180 
find special water filters that take out
that<00:02:21.330> fluoride<00:02:21.690> now<00:02:22.530> it<00:02:22.620> is<00:02:22.769> true<00:02:23.159> that

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:23.190 
that fluoride now it is true that

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:26.089 
that fluoride now it is true that
fluoride<00:02:23.819> has<00:02:24.000> been<00:02:24.239> proven<00:02:24.890> topically<00:02:25.890> to

00:02:26.089 --> 00:02:26.099 
fluoride has been proven topically to

00:02:26.099 --> 00:02:28.460 
fluoride has been proven topically to
strengthen<00:02:26.640> the<00:02:26.790> tooth<00:02:27.090> but<00:02:27.930> there's<00:02:28.140> a<00:02:28.230> lot

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:28.470 
strengthen the tooth but there's a lot

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:30.259 
strengthen the tooth but there's a lot
of<00:02:28.560> other<00:02:28.799> things<00:02:29.099> we<00:02:29.250> can<00:02:29.400> do<00:02:29.549> they<00:02:30.000> can<00:02:30.030> do

00:02:30.259 --> 00:02:30.269 
of other things we can do they can do

00:02:30.269 --> 00:02:31.729 
of other things we can do they can do
just<00:02:30.480> the<00:02:30.599> same<00:02:30.780> thing<00:02:31.049> and<00:02:31.170> I<00:02:31.260> don't<00:02:31.319> think<00:02:31.560> we

00:02:31.729 --> 00:02:31.739 
just the same thing and I don't think we

00:02:31.739 --> 00:02:33.380 
just the same thing and I don't think we
need<00:02:31.860> to<00:02:31.980> use<00:02:32.129> something<00:02:32.400> that's<00:02:32.489> toxic<00:02:33.120> to<00:02:33.239> do

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:33.390

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:35.310 
that now some alternatives to tooth base

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:36.949 
that now some alternatives to tooth base
