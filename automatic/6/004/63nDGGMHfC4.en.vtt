00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.500
This is making of our latest video

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000
It´s the hardest video we have made so far

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:16.180
It took us almost 8 months to make it

00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:18.920
And it´s not the first Minecraft video we have made

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:21.560
And this is not our first Youtube channel we have ever had

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:26.620
Before this channel we had a channel focusing just on Minecraft videos

00:00:26.620 --> 00:00:29.900
It´s called SquareFreaks, the link is in the description if you would like to check it out

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:31.900
So we decided to film yet

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:34.620
one last cool Minecraft video

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:36.620
We have been working on it from december

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:39.360
that´s when we did the first test which we posted on Facebook

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:41.360
And we started to film it approximately in January

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:44.240
we were filming it for four months and

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:46.200
the rest was editing

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:46.240
It´s the most complex video we have ever made
the rest was editing

00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:48.240
It´s the most complex video we have ever made

00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:51.840
So for the first time ever

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:53.840
we made a story board

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:55.840
where we drew every single shot

00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:56.680
from this video

00:00:56.680 --> 00:00:59.840
Event though in the end we did everything without it

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:01.400
but we got story board!

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:03.820
Filming

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:05.820
We had to film it 13 times

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:07.820
in a studio which is not in my house

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:09.820
so we had to go there every time

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:12.340
It´s a really profesionally equiped studio

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:14.860
it wasn´t easy to film so technically advanced shots

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:16.860
with so bad green screen

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:18.860
because we had it badly lighted

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:20.860
or wrinkled

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:22.860
we had minimum of time

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:26.000
we had it dirtied by cakes

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:30.580
Most of the shots we had to redo 5-10 times

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:32.580
or we made multiple variants

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:34.580
and each on of those we had to redo

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:37.620
A lot of shots didn´t even make the final cut

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:40.320
for the first time we used practical effects

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:41.460
we made blood

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:49.920
it´s cool that this video has approximately 65 shots with full 3D graphics

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:51.920
Our normal video, for example,

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:53.420
"motorbike chase"

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:55.120
has 1 shot with 3D graphics

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:57.120
Only one in the whole video

00:01:57.120 --> 00:01:59.120
In this video there´s 65 of them

00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:01.120
In couple of shots

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:03.120
one frame of video rendered for

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:05.120
approximately 3 minutes

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:07.120
Our video has 24 frames per second

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:10.240
so that´s 72 minutes of rendering for 1 second of video

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:12.240
That´s why it took 6 months

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:14.240
Most of the shots are easy

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:16.240
Just keyed out the green screen

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:18.240
and rendered Minecraft background

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:20.440
But we have a couple of more difficult ones

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:21.820
where´s interaction

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:23.820
for example climbing out of holes or

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:25.820
catching a wall

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:27.820
or the tnt shot

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:29.820
We always used a real object

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:31.820
which we could grab

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:34.880
Sometimes we had to use various tables

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:36.880
boxes and things like that so

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:39.780
we could approximately build the enviroment we needed

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:42.260
For the table not to move

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:43.860
when I step up it´s corner

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:45.860
we resolved it really creatively

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:53.800
hey, iron, wohooo

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:57.000
the sound design was really interesting

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:01.300
because we didn´t film a single sound

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:02.160
during filming

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:03.900
everything had to be made after filming

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:05.140
every single sound

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:07.140
because it would not be practical to also capture sounds

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:09.140
when we were short on time

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:11.480
most of the sounds were interaction with enviroment

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:13.820
which weren´t in the studio, because it was made digitally

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:15.200
so it was impossible to capture sound

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:20.520
we didn´t oil the wheels

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:22.520
Pretty much every shot is composed of

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:24.520
few sound layers

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:26.280
there has to be ambience

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:28.280
which is sound of the background

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:29.520
because in real life 

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:30.860
there is never complete silence

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:32.860
Either there´s a fridge in the background

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:34.860
air conditioning or

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:36.860
cars outside, the wind is blowing

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:39.880
Then there are sounds such as

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:41.880
steps

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:43.880
or rustle of clothes

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:47.680
Just interaction, which we did a great deal of work on

00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:50.680
because it completes realism of the enviroment

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:54.700
And in the rest of the video there are vocals, voices

00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:56.700
Just warious hmmm or

00:03:56.700 --> 00:03:58.920
growling and sounds like that

00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:00.700
"no way, iron!"

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:04.840
At some moments there are Minecraft sounds

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:08.620
which aren´t common, but they are mixed in

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:12.320
Event though it´s Minecraft, but we wanted to make it somehow differently

00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:19.080
And on top of that there can be also music

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:22.060
Few sounds are available online

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:24.060
because they aren´t easy to make

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:26.060
But they aren´t always good enough

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:27.940
and that´s why we made a lot of sounds by ourselves

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:29.940
We usually do that when filming

00:05:05.140 --> 00:05:07.120
If we forgot something just write us

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:09.120
ask us in the comments or on the Facebook

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:10.740
We will gladly answer

00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:12.420
And that´s it

00:05:12.420 --> 00:05:15.620
It was the harderst video we´ve ever made

00:05:15.660 --> 00:05:16.960
and I hope it won´t have many views

00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:18.540
 so we won´t have to film another one

00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:57.980
