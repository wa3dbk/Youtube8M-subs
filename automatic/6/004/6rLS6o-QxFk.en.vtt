00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.200
 hey niklas in her this time in the cinema check 

00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:06.120
 it's about birdman and love 

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:08.429
 Michael Keaton ends his wings 

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:10.320
 receives and why the movie fobbed off so 

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:16.139
 and still pretty cool that 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:20.330
 you find out now we are only here 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:24.449
 I landed after luck 

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:25.500
 we had everything so it was star 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:27.750
 already forgotten 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:29.160
 they fear people could say they 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:30.869
 make this piece against the 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:33.360
 impression to fight you are one 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:35.070
 wrecked superhero absolutely not 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:38.960
 so I have to 20 years ago 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:38.960
 refused to turn with four 

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:45.809
 You only do that because you have a chance 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:47.700
 Like all other're just important 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:49.940
 now you are about to destroy it 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:52.140
 what's left of your career 

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:54.090
 will have to do the reality show 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:55.630
 We offered to know that I am 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:58.010
 right have the flaps 

00:00:55.630 --> 00:00:59.570
 the hollywood star akon thompson 

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:01.790
 played by michael keaton was earlier 

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:03.560
 one of the big ones in the 90s 

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:06.140
 He was very successful for years 

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:07.820
 played the comic hero birdman as he 

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:10.460
 but this is the filming of the 

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:12.800
 fourth part on said he crashed into a 

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:14.570
 career low now he tries the turn 

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:16.580
 at the broadway and tries as 

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:18.950
 director and actor 

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:20.480
 but not only leaves his old role 

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:22.400
 not really going on but also 

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:24.980
 his cast drives him slowly but 

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:26.300
 safe in the madness and the premiere 

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:28.070
 but moves closer and closer 

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:30.560
 what else happens in the movie 

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:31.970
 and how the whole piece starts later 

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:33.619
 You will find out in the cinema 

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:34.940
 the focus is on the birdman 

00:01:33.619 --> 00:01:36.770
 on the one hand, on the main protagonist 

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:38.479
 stretch thompson of his former 

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:39.860
 highly formally backcountry and necessarily 

00:01:38.479 --> 00:01:41.450
 want to create the big success 

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:44.270
 On the other hand, the film is also one 

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:45.590
 satire is about yes hollywood 

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:47.780
 just right on the shovel 

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:49.820
 takes and cares about everyone too big and 

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:51.830
 Mighty blockbuster makes fun of and 

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:53.479
 just as a movie is one becomes 

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:54.770
 not because the tragicomedy is coming 

00:01:53.479 --> 00:01:56.630
 something extreme again 

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:58.790
 sophisticated in the cinema where the 

00:01:56.630 --> 00:02:00.590
 spectators often times in the dark 

00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:03.500
 what is left real and what is left 

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:05.870
 Fiction is and you have to watch the movie here 

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:07.610
 make a huge praise because it was 

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:10.429
 an experiment started the film becomes 

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:12.290
 as apparent and aker recorded that 

00:02:10.429 --> 00:02:14.570
 means the cuts were at the places 

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:15.230
 where you do not put the untrained eye 

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:17.810
 able to see 

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:19.130
 that makes the film very fluid 

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:20.989
 and also gives him a very nice one 

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:22.519
 narrative tempo I think so well 

00:02:20.989 --> 00:02:24.410
 It should also be mentioned that the 

00:02:22.519 --> 00:02:27.769
 large part of the film at a set play 

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:30.500
 because he is mainly in the theater where 

00:02:27.769 --> 00:02:31.970
 also there then the cast very tight and 

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:33.890
 constantly meets and must 

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:35.750
 you really praise the cast then straight 

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:38.690
 Michael Keaton as the anti hero or 

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:40.549
 Edward Norton as an actor easy 

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:43.370
 Everything gets out of its roll just what 

00:02:40.549 --> 00:02:46.510
 is really brilliant then yes 

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:48.799
 emma stone is still the one here 

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:50.780
 former drug addict and very 

00:02:48.799 --> 00:02:52.790
 introverts plays when you 

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:54.650
 must say look at her too 

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:55.670
 a slip were recorded where they 

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:57.320
 really how you really ask yourself 

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:58.940
 how has she got all this text 

00:02:57.320 --> 00:03:00.530
 So you can really remember here 

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:04.310
 actually the cast by the bank away 

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:06.480
 an absolute hat off or create 

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:08.130
 the film does not only do it 

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:10.170
 due to his occupation due to 

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:12.599
 chaos fun but he is too 

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:14.280
 properly durchgeknallt somehow through 

00:03:12.599 --> 00:03:15.870
 the desperate attempts finally 

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:18.330
 to become famous again and through the 

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:20.459
 constant presence drunk and 

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:22.620
 former junkies will not only 

00:03:20.459 --> 00:03:25.110
 slowly but surely the main protagonist 

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:27.180
 crazy because it somehow pulls 

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:28.220
 the audience keeps on coming in 

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:31.220
 the madness 

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:33.390
 also the side blows on hollywood 

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:35.040
 Just enjoy each of the times over the 

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:36.299
 it looks right at the edge of the plate 

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:38.910
 is again at the time one 

00:03:36.299 --> 00:03:41.700
 typical superhero movie very different 

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:44.880
 and so birdman rings that 

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:47.100
 yes, there antiheroes and heroes properly 

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:49.620
 we'll see hollywood with us 

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:51.540
 this criticism goes around and let's see yes 

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:53.010
 when oscars table comes i'm on it 

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:55.080
 We are very excited about the film 

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:56.970
 In any case 9 out of 10 score it 

00:03:55.080 --> 00:04:00.030
 definitely a cinema cinema movie though 

00:03:56.970 --> 00:04:02.069

 rather in other movie should watch 

00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:10.470
 because as already mentioned birdman is 

00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:11.340
 a bit more demanding yes too
