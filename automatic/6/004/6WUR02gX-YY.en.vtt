00:00:05.690 --> 00:00:05.700 
hello there YouTube Exodus here and one

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:07.639 
hello there YouTube Exodus here and one
of<00:00:05.819> the<00:00:05.879> things<00:00:05.940> i<00:00:06.330> love<00:00:06.690> doing<00:00:06.930> with<00:00:07.109> redstone

00:00:07.639 --> 00:00:07.649 
of the things i love doing with redstone

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:13.610 
of the things i love doing with redstone
is<00:00:08.570> spending<00:00:09.570> a<00:00:10.309> number<00:00:11.309> of<00:00:11.370> hours<00:00:12.620> making

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:13.620 
is spending a number of hours making

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:16.609 
is spending a number of hours making
some<00:00:13.920> complex<00:00:14.400> stuff<00:00:14.700> in<00:00:15.540> order<00:00:15.750> to<00:00:15.990> save<00:00:16.199> me<00:00:16.440> a

00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:16.619 
some complex stuff in order to save me a

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:20.840 
some complex stuff in order to save me a
few<00:00:16.920> seconds<00:00:17.310> later<00:00:17.760> on<00:00:18.000> in<00:00:18.150> the<00:00:18.210> game<00:00:19.670> this<00:00:20.670> is

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:20.850 
few seconds later on in the game this is

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:25.730 
few seconds later on in the game this is
what<00:00:21.029> I've<00:00:21.119> done<00:00:21.300> here<00:00:21.359> and<00:00:22.050> this<00:00:22.800> is<00:00:22.980> a<00:00:24.740> tree

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:25.740 
what I've done here and this is a tree

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:31.519 
what I've done here and this is a tree
farm<00:00:26.099> sort<00:00:26.880> of<00:00:27.000> and<00:00:27.949> what<00:00:28.949> it<00:00:29.130> will<00:00:29.340> do<00:00:29.580> is<00:00:30.529> push

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:31.529 
farm sort of and what it will do is push

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:36.139 
farm sort of and what it will do is push
all<00:00:31.830> the<00:00:32.040> wood<00:00:32.250> blocks<00:00:32.520> out<00:00:33.090> here<00:00:33.649> and<00:00:35.149> that's

00:00:36.139 --> 00:00:36.149 
all the wood blocks out here and that's

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:42.020 
all the wood blocks out here and that's
about<00:00:36.270> it<00:00:37.550> and<00:00:39.379> I've<00:00:40.489> tried<00:00:41.489> to<00:00:41.790> make<00:00:42.000> one

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:42.030 
about it and I've tried to make one

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:47.240 
about it and I've tried to make one
before<00:00:43.910> but<00:00:44.910> and<00:00:45.829> there<00:00:46.829> are<00:00:46.890> a<00:00:46.920> couple<00:00:47.070> of

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.250 
before but and there are a couple of

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:51.560 
before but and there are a couple of
things<00:00:47.340> that<00:00:47.820> made<00:00:48.059> it<00:00:48.210> difficult<00:00:48.930> and<00:00:50.420> was<00:00:51.420> I

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570 
things that made it difficult and was I

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:54.350 
things that made it difficult and was I
will<00:00:51.750> solve<00:00:52.050> my<00:00:52.110> problems<00:00:52.680> by<00:00:53.149> having<00:00:54.149> two

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
will solve my problems by having two

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:59.180 
will solve my problems by having two
separate<00:00:55.670> mechanisms<00:00:56.670> one<00:00:57.660> pushes<00:00:58.649> the<00:00:58.859> wood

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190 
separate mechanisms one pushes the wood

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:04.250 
separate mechanisms one pushes the wood
this<00:00:59.550> way<00:00:59.730> and<00:01:00.469> then<00:01:01.550> sand<00:01:02.550> will<00:01:03.120> fall<00:01:03.899> down<00:01:04.110> on

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260 
this way and then sand will fall down on

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:05.870 
this way and then sand will fall down on
top<00:01:04.409> of<00:01:04.470> the<00:01:04.619> tree<00:01:04.830> in<00:01:05.159> order<00:01:05.430> to<00:01:05.549> be<00:01:05.670> able<00:01:05.729> to

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
top of the tree in order to be able to

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:11.190 
top of the tree in order to be able to
push<00:01:06.090> the<00:01:06.299> wood<00:01:06.630> down<00:01:07.200> and<00:01:08.330> then<00:01:09.330> once<00:01:10.049> the

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:11.200 
push the wood down and then once the

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:15.719 
push the wood down and then once the
all<00:01:11.680> the<00:01:12.039> wood<00:01:12.219> is<00:01:12.369> gone<00:01:12.610> the<00:01:14.340> sand<00:01:15.340> will<00:01:15.579> get

00:01:15.719 --> 00:01:15.729 
all the wood is gone the sand will get

00:01:15.729 --> 00:01:19.610 
all the wood is gone the sand will get
pushed<00:01:16.000> in<00:01:16.329> another<00:01:16.659> direction

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:19.620 

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:24.650 

that<00:01:20.280> enabled<00:01:20.820> me<00:01:20.880> to<00:01:20.970> solve<00:01:21.360> my<00:01:23.660> problems

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:24.660 
that enabled me to solve my problems

00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:26.859 
that enabled me to solve my problems
with<00:01:24.840> this

00:01:26.859 --> 00:01:26.869 
with this

00:01:26.869 --> 00:01:32.719 
with this
semi-automatic<00:01:27.869> tree<00:01:28.259> formatting<00:01:29.119> and<00:01:30.119> so<00:01:31.729> in

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729 
semi-automatic tree formatting and so in

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:34.560 
semi-automatic tree formatting and so in
the<00:01:32.909> back<00:01:33.090> I<00:01:33.390> have

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:34.570 
the back I have

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:40.950 
the back I have
start<00:01:35.570> button<00:01:36.100> it<00:01:37.100> goes<00:01:37.159> into<00:01:37.869> this<00:01:38.869> little

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:40.960 
start button it goes into this little

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:45.539 
start button it goes into this little
RS<00:01:41.710> nor<00:01:41.890> latch<00:01:41.950> and<00:01:42.960> that<00:01:43.960> enables<00:01:44.470> the<00:01:44.770> clock

00:01:45.539 --> 00:01:45.549 
RS nor latch and that enables the clock

00:01:45.549 --> 00:01:47.990 
RS nor latch and that enables the clock
signal<00:01:45.760> to<00:01:46.360> go<00:01:46.510> through

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:48.000 
signal to go through

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.540 
signal to go through
the<00:01:48.540> start<00:01:49.110> button<00:01:49.350> also<00:01:49.710> goes<00:01:50.100> into<00:01:50.130> this

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:50.550 
the start button also goes into this

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:53.660 
the start button also goes into this
monostable<00:01:51.210> circuit<00:01:52.100> which<00:01:53.100> sends<00:01:53.490> out<00:01:53.640> a

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670 
monostable circuit which sends out a

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:59.410 
monostable circuit which sends out a
pulse<00:01:54.200> which<00:01:55.820> works<00:01:56.820> as<00:01:57.030> a<00:01:57.060> clock<00:01:57.540> signal

00:01:59.410 --> 00:01:59.420 
pulse which works as a clock signal

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:03.870 
pulse which works as a clock signal
and<00:02:00.850> every<00:02:01.850> time<00:02:01.880> it<00:02:02.180> goes<00:02:02.330> it<00:02:02.869> comes<00:02:03.200> here<00:02:03.439> it

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:03.880 
and every time it goes it comes here it

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:07.060 
and every time it goes it comes here it
will<00:02:04.880> go<00:02:05.119> through<00:02:05.450> this<00:02:05.630> block<00:02:05.960> and<00:02:06.229> the<00:02:06.830> first

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:07.070 
will go through this block and the first

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:09.520 
will go through this block and the first
couple<00:02:08.030> of<00:02:08.179> times<00:02:08.270> it<00:02:08.720> will<00:02:08.810> go<00:02:08.989> into<00:02:09.229> this

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:09.530 
couple of times it will go into this

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:13.240 
couple of times it will go into this
part<00:02:10.429> of<00:02:10.520> the<00:02:10.610> mechanism<00:02:10.759> and<00:02:11.920> then<00:02:12.920> it<00:02:13.069> will

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:13.250 
part of the mechanism and then it will

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:15.699 
part of the mechanism and then it will
switch<00:02:13.489> and<00:02:13.819> go<00:02:13.940> into<00:02:14.090> this<00:02:14.330> part<00:02:14.599> and<00:02:14.870> that's

00:02:15.699 --> 00:02:15.709 
switch and go into this part and that's

00:02:15.709 --> 00:02:19.979 
switch and go into this part and that's
because<00:02:15.950> I<00:02:16.250> have<00:02:16.400> a<00:02:16.430> counter<00:02:16.970> in<00:02:17.180> the<00:02:17.450> back<00:02:18.459> and

00:02:19.979 --> 00:02:19.989 
because I have a counter in the back and

00:02:19.989 --> 00:02:22.030 
because I have a counter in the back and
here

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:22.040 
here

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:25.010 
here
and<00:02:22.129> after<00:02:23.030> seven

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:25.020 
and after seven

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:27.340 
and after seven
cycles

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:27.350 
cycles

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:30.790 
cycles
it<00:02:27.920> will<00:02:28.160> switch<00:02:28.430> this<00:02:28.700> RS<00:02:29.030> nor<00:02:29.180> latch<00:02:29.240> and<00:02:30.230> so

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:30.800 
it will switch this RS nor latch and so

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:35.170 
it will switch this RS nor latch and so
the<00:02:31.810> piston<00:02:32.810> moves<00:02:32.840> and<00:02:33.290> then<00:02:34.280> after<00:02:34.820> seven

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:35.180 
the piston moves and then after seven

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:39.640 
the piston moves and then after seven
more<00:02:35.360> cycles<00:02:35.890> it<00:02:36.890> will<00:02:37.390> reset<00:02:38.390> the<00:02:38.650> reset

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:39.650 
more cycles it will reset the reset

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:42.550 
more cycles it will reset the reset
itself<00:02:39.950> they<00:02:40.340> counter<00:02:40.790> resets<00:02:41.120> itself<00:02:41.560> resets

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:42.560 
itself they counter resets itself resets

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:48.580 
itself they counter resets itself resets
this<00:02:42.830> one<00:02:43.040> and<00:02:44.050> turns<00:02:45.050> the<00:02:45.290> clock<00:02:45.500> off<00:02:46.210> so<00:02:47.590> let

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:48.590 
this one and turns the clock off so let

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:50.250 
this one and turns the clock off so let
me<00:02:48.620> show<00:02:48.860> you<00:02:48.890> how<00:02:49.010> it<00:02:49.190> works<00:02:49.250> I'm<00:02:49.790> going<00:02:49.850> to

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:50.260 
me show you how it works I'm going to

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:53.230 
me show you how it works I'm going to
prove<00:02:51.260> this<00:02:51.560> tree<00:02:51.980> a<00:02:52.010> bit<00:02:52.250> so<00:02:52.730> that<00:02:52.760> you<00:02:53.000> can

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:53.240 
prove this tree a bit so that you can

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:59.860 
prove this tree a bit so that you can
see

00:02:59.860 --> 00:02:59.870 

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:08.640 

what's<00:03:00.319> gonna<00:03:00.500> happen

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:08.650 

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:11.339 

see<00:03:09.129> the<00:03:09.430> first<00:03:09.819> wood<00:03:10.540> block<00:03:10.780> is<00:03:10.959> pushed<00:03:11.200> out

00:03:11.339 --> 00:03:11.349 
see the first wood block is pushed out

00:03:11.349 --> 00:03:13.289 
see the first wood block is pushed out
and<00:03:11.620> then<00:03:11.709> there<00:03:11.860> will<00:03:11.950> be<00:03:12.129> two<00:03:12.340> empty<00:03:12.730> cycles

00:03:13.289 --> 00:03:13.299 
and then there will be two empty cycles

00:03:13.299 --> 00:03:19.440 
and then there will be two empty cycles
or<00:03:13.629> even<00:03:14.319> three<00:03:14.650> a<00:03:17.310> now<00:03:18.310> to<00:03:18.370> set<00:03:18.819> two<00:03:19.030> cycles

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:19.450 
or even three a now to set two cycles

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:22.679 
or even three a now to set two cycles
before<00:03:19.780> the<00:03:20.260> food<00:03:20.890> starts<00:03:21.760> getting<00:03:22.180> pushed<00:03:22.510> up

00:03:22.679 --> 00:03:22.689 
before the food starts getting pushed up

00:03:22.689 --> 00:03:24.720 
before the food starts getting pushed up
again

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:24.730 
again

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:26.880 
again
and<00:03:25.120> you<00:03:25.390> can<00:03:25.540> start<00:03:25.720> shopping<00:03:26.019> at<00:03:26.409> once<00:03:26.680> if

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:26.890 
and you can start shopping at once if

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:29.930 
and you can start shopping at once if
you<00:03:27.010> want<00:03:27.390> we<00:03:28.390> can<00:03:28.540> wait<00:03:28.780> until<00:03:28.810> it's<00:03:29.230> finished

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:29.940 
you want we can wait until it's finished

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:33.800 
you want we can wait until it's finished
then<00:03:30.940> the<00:03:31.360> other<00:03:31.750> cycle<00:03:32.620> stops<00:03:32.890> which<00:03:33.549> is

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:33.810 
then the other cycle stops which is

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:35.760 
then the other cycle stops which is
pushing<00:03:34.810> d

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:35.770 
pushing d

00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:45.140 
pushing d
son<00:03:36.490> back<00:03:36.970> up<00:03:37.120> again<00:03:37.420> and<00:03:38.140> fill<00:03:38.440> this<00:03:38.860> stack

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:45.150 

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:48.860 

so<00:03:45.900> the<00:03:46.590> first<00:03:46.829> part<00:03:47.099> is<00:03:47.510> working<00:03:48.510> with<00:03:48.659> this

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:48.870 
so the first part is working with this

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:54.800 
so the first part is working with this
this<00:03:49.500> and<00:03:50.180> this<00:03:52.159> piston<00:03:53.159> and<00:03:53.340> the<00:03:53.629> second<00:03:54.629> part

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:54.810 
this and this piston and the second part

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:58.350 
this and this piston and the second part
works<00:03:55.200> with<00:03:55.439> the<00:03:55.560> rest<00:03:55.769> this<00:03:56.220> one<00:03:56.430> this<00:03:56.849> one

00:03:58.350 --> 00:03:58.360 
works with the rest this one this one

00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:01.620 
works with the rest this one this one
this<00:03:58.900> one<00:03:59.170> this<00:03:59.470> one<00:03:59.740> and<00:03:59.920> this<00:04:00.010> one<00:04:00.580> and<00:04:00.910> that

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:01.630 
this one this one and this one and that

00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:05.330 
this one this one and this one and that
refills<00:04:02.230> the<00:04:02.350> stack<00:04:02.680> up<00:04:02.860> here<00:04:03.450> so<00:04:04.450> that<00:04:04.690> it<00:04:04.870> can

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:05.340 
refills the stack up here so that it can

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:08.370 
refills the stack up here so that it can
come<00:04:06.340> down<00:04:06.550> again<00:04:06.780> one<00:04:07.780> of<00:04:07.810> the<00:04:07.990> important

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:08.380 
come down again one of the important

00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:11.100 
come down again one of the important
things<00:04:08.470> with<00:04:08.830> this<00:04:09.040> is<00:04:09.340> that<00:04:09.670> the<00:04:10.080> height<00:04:11.080> of

00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:11.110 
things with this is that the height of

00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:14.520 
things with this is that the height of
the<00:04:11.410> tree<00:04:11.650> is<00:04:11.830> limited<00:04:12.520> to<00:04:12.790> its<00:04:12.940> minimum<00:04:13.530> so

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:14.530 
the tree is limited to its minimum so

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:16.550 
the tree is limited to its minimum so
that<00:04:14.560> it<00:04:14.950> will<00:04:15.220> always<00:04:15.640> be<00:04:15.880> the<00:04:16.000> same<00:04:16.030> height

00:04:16.550 --> 00:04:16.560 
that it will always be the same height

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:22.920 
that it will always be the same height
it<00:04:18.420> it<00:04:19.420> can't<00:04:20.170> go<00:04:20.410> higher<00:04:20.620> than<00:04:20.680> this<00:04:21.240> and<00:04:22.240> I

00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:22.930 
it it can't go higher than this and I

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:25.380 
it it can't go higher than this and I
can<00:04:23.380> if<00:04:23.920> this<00:04:24.100> is<00:04:24.280> the<00:04:24.310> smallest<00:04:24.760> size<00:04:25.090> and

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:25.390 
can if this is the smallest size and

00:04:25.390 --> 00:04:28.080 
can if this is the smallest size and
this<00:04:26.080> block<00:04:26.680> here<00:04:26.890> prevents<00:04:27.460> the<00:04:27.580> tree<00:04:27.880> from

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:28.090 
this block here prevents the tree from

00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:31.710 
this block here prevents the tree from
growing<00:04:28.560> and<00:04:29.560> its<00:04:29.950> holder<00:04:30.220> if<00:04:30.400> it<00:04:31.180> grew<00:04:31.360> taller

00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:31.720 
growing and its holder if it grew taller

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:34.380 
growing and its holder if it grew taller
you<00:04:32.050> would<00:04:32.620> need<00:04:32.770> a<00:04:32.830> variable<00:04:33.460> amount<00:04:33.700> of<00:04:33.880> sand

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:34.390 
you would need a variable amount of sand

00:04:34.390 --> 00:04:37.320 
you would need a variable amount of sand
falling<00:04:34.720> down<00:04:35.190> so<00:04:36.190> that<00:04:36.580> would<00:04:37.000> be<00:04:37.030> a<00:04:37.150> bit

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:37.330 
falling down so that would be a bit

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:44.270 
falling down so that would be a bit
difficult<00:04:37.540> and<00:04:38.010> also<00:04:39.010> if<00:04:39.370> you<00:04:41.790> start<00:04:42.790> it<00:04:42.970> and

00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:44.280 
difficult and also if you start it and

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:51.950 
difficult and also if you start it and
before<00:04:45.990> all<00:04:46.990> the<00:04:47.290> trees<00:04:47.560> have<00:04:47.800> grown<00:04:48.270> it<00:04:49.270> can

00:04:51.950 --> 00:04:51.960 

00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:55.970 

fail<00:04:52.960> I<00:04:53.430> guess<00:04:54.430> it<00:04:54.639> will

00:04:55.970 --> 00:04:55.980 
fail I guess it will

00:04:55.980 --> 00:04:58.370 
fail I guess it will
start<00:04:56.670> pushing<00:04:57.030> sand<00:04:57.330> out<00:04:57.570> this<00:04:57.780> way<00:04:57.990> and<00:04:58.020> then

00:04:58.370 --> 00:04:58.380 
start pushing sand out this way and then

00:04:58.380 --> 00:05:00.590 
start pushing sand out this way and then
there<00:04:58.500> will<00:04:58.620> be<00:04:58.680> enough<00:04:59.070> sand<00:04:59.370> going<00:04:59.970> up<00:05:00.120> to

00:05:00.590 --> 00:05:00.600 
there will be enough sand going up to

00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:05.270 
there will be enough sand going up to
refill<00:05:03.350> as<00:05:04.350> long<00:05:04.560> as<00:05:04.590> all<00:05:04.800> the<00:05:04.920> trees<00:05:05.160> have

00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:05.280 
refill as long as all the trees have

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:20.870 
refill as long as all the trees have
grown<00:05:05.460> it<00:05:06.090> works<00:05:06.540> very<00:05:06.960> well

00:05:20.870 --> 00:05:20.880 

00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:24.879 

and<00:05:21.000> one<00:05:21.390> more

00:05:24.879 --> 00:05:24.889 

00:05:24.889 --> 00:05:33.790 

yeah<00:05:25.460> it's<00:05:25.969> back<00:05:26.240> to<00:05:26.560> its<00:05:27.560> original<00:05:27.919> state

00:05:33.790 --> 00:05:33.800 

00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:37.730 

and<00:05:33.919> the

00:05:37.730 --> 00:05:37.740 

00:05:37.740 --> 00:05:40.070 

and<00:05:38.460> one<00:05:38.940> of<00:05:38.970> the<00:05:39.120> issues<00:05:39.210> is<00:05:39.389> you<00:05:39.750> have<00:05:39.870> to<00:05:39.990> be

00:05:40.070 --> 00:05:40.080 
and one of the issues is you have to be

00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:42.020 
and one of the issues is you have to be
careful<00:05:40.259> with<00:05:40.560> the<00:05:40.710> timing<00:05:41.130> and<00:05:41.250> on<00:05:41.910> the

00:05:42.020 --> 00:05:42.030 
careful with the timing and on the

00:05:42.030 --> 00:05:45.409 
careful with the timing and on the
Pistons<00:05:42.419> so<00:05:42.780> that<00:05:43.400> this<00:05:44.400> block<00:05:44.759> get<00:05:44.970> pushed<00:05:45.210> in

00:05:45.409 --> 00:05:45.419 
Pistons so that this block get pushed in

00:05:45.419 --> 00:05:49.879 
Pistons so that this block get pushed in
just<00:05:45.990> as<00:05:46.199> this<00:05:47.330> piston<00:05:48.330> retracts<00:05:48.810> so<00:05:49.470> that<00:05:49.680> it

00:05:49.879 --> 00:05:49.889 
just as this piston retracts so that it

00:05:49.889 --> 00:05:53.089 
just as this piston retracts so that it
can<00:05:50.360> put<00:05:51.360> the<00:05:51.569> new<00:05:51.810> son<00:05:52.080> look<00:05:52.319> under<00:05:52.710> the<00:05:52.860> stack

00:05:53.089 --> 00:05:53.099 
can put the new son look under the stack

00:05:53.099 --> 00:05:56.960 
can put the new son look under the stack
before<00:05:53.310> the<00:05:53.639> stock<00:05:53.880> falls<00:05:54.120> down<00:05:54.389> and<00:05:55.849> what<00:05:56.849> I'm

00:05:56.960 --> 00:05:56.970 
before the stock falls down and what I'm

00:05:56.970 --> 00:06:00.460 
before the stock falls down and what I'm
using<00:05:57.240> is<00:05:57.690> they

00:06:00.460 --> 00:06:00.470 

00:06:00.470 --> 00:06:02.810 

so

00:06:02.810 --> 00:06:02.820 
so

00:06:02.820 --> 00:06:05.940 
so
with<00:06:03.390> this<00:06:03.570> bonus<00:06:03.960> terrible<00:06:04.260> circuit<00:06:04.590> it

00:06:05.940 --> 00:06:05.950 
with this bonus terrible circuit it

00:06:05.950 --> 00:06:10.460 
with this bonus terrible circuit it
turns<00:06:06.550> into<00:06:06.790> four<00:06:07.270> tix<00:06:07.540> between<00:06:08.050> each<00:06:08.460> piston

00:06:10.460 --> 00:06:10.470 
turns into four tix between each piston

00:06:10.470 --> 00:06:13.980 
turns into four tix between each piston
actually<00:06:11.470> like<00:06:11.710> the<00:06:12.210> five<00:06:13.210> tix<00:06:13.510> I<00:06:13.660> had<00:06:13.840> to

00:06:13.980 --> 00:06:13.990 
actually like the five tix I had to

00:06:13.990 --> 00:06:17.490 
actually like the five tix I had to
adjust<00:06:14.260> it<00:06:14.500> actually<00:06:14.980> so<00:06:15.550> it's<00:06:15.840> on<00:06:16.840> sum<00:06:17.230> of<00:06:17.380> the

00:06:17.490 --> 00:06:17.500 
adjust it actually so it's on sum of the

00:06:17.500 --> 00:06:20.400 
adjust it actually so it's on sum of the
distances<00:06:18.280> for<00:06:18.910> ticks<00:06:19.180> and<00:06:19.360> someone's<00:06:19.750> five

00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:20.410 
distances for ticks and someone's five

00:06:20.410 --> 00:06:25.380 
distances for ticks and someone's five
tix<00:06:20.710> I<00:06:20.860> do<00:06:21.220> not<00:06:21.400> understand<00:06:22.180> why<00:06:23.730> it's<00:06:24.730> acting

00:06:25.380 --> 00:06:25.390 
tix I do not understand why it's acting

00:06:25.390 --> 00:06:34.830 
tix I do not understand why it's acting
that<00:06:25.840> way<00:06:25.900> but<00:06:26.500> anyway<00:06:26.950> works

00:06:34.830 --> 00:06:34.840 

00:06:34.840 --> 00:06:36.260 

so

00:06:36.260 --> 00:06:36.270 
so

00:06:36.270 --> 00:06:45.020 
so
that's<00:06:36.900> why<00:06:37.080> send<00:06:37.530> me<00:06:37.590> with<00:06:37.710> my<00:06:37.890> factory<00:06:38.220> phone

00:06:45.020 --> 00:06:45.030 

00:06:45.030 --> 00:06:48.560 

I<00:06:45.120> have<00:06:45.810> an<00:06:45.930> early<00:06:46.290> version<00:06:47.130> of<00:06:47.430> it<00:06:47.580> here<00:06:47.850> and

00:06:48.560 --> 00:06:48.570 
I have an early version of it here and

00:06:48.570 --> 00:06:52.820 
I have an early version of it here and
this<00:06:48.870> is<00:06:49.050> how<00:06:49.170> I<00:06:49.200> started<00:06:49.740> up<00:06:49.860> and<00:06:51.830> tree

00:06:52.820 --> 00:06:52.830 
this is how I started up and tree

00:06:52.830 --> 00:06:54.950 
this is how I started up and tree
growing<00:06:53.130> here<00:06:53.430> pushing<00:06:53.970> the<00:06:54.150> wood<00:06:54.300> out<00:06:54.330> and

00:06:54.950 --> 00:06:54.960 
growing here pushing the wood out and

00:06:54.960 --> 00:06:58.370 
growing here pushing the wood out and
pushing<00:06:55.920> the<00:06:56.130> sound<00:06:56.340> this<00:06:56.520> way<00:06:57.170> sign<00:06:58.170> goes

00:06:58.370 --> 00:06:58.380 
pushing the sound this way sign goes

00:06:58.380 --> 00:07:03.220 
pushing the sound this way sign goes
around<00:06:58.710> and<00:06:58.920> refills<00:06:59.880> this<00:07:00.210> stack

00:07:03.220 --> 00:07:03.230 

00:07:03.230 --> 00:07:05.880 

but<00:07:03.470> i<00:07:03.500> was<00:07:03.860> able<00:07:03.950> to<00:07:04.220> make<00:07:04.370> it<00:07:04.520> a<00:07:04.730> bit<00:07:05.270> smaller

00:07:05.880 --> 00:07:05.890 
but i was able to make it a bit smaller

00:07:05.890 --> 00:07:15.830 
but i was able to make it a bit smaller
with<00:07:06.890> this<00:07:07.070> setup<00:07:07.420> instead

00:07:15.830 --> 00:07:15.840 

00:07:15.840 --> 00:07:20.540
