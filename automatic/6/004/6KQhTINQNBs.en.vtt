00:00:00.010 --> 00:00:08.650
 So forgive me, I am Stalin, the party committee today 

00:00:06.190 --> 00:00:12.100
 we will discuss the transfer box 

00:00:08.650 --> 00:00:13.059
 framework I twisted it in principle 

00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:19.090
 quick 

00:00:13.059 --> 00:00:21.270
 from the mustache bagels trimming wanted to say 

00:00:19.090 --> 00:00:24.180
 about 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:28.500
 foundation crowded 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:42.100
 such as the frame was not so simple 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:50.829
 sheathed with plywood 

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:55.589
 boring and that's so pretty long I'm with this 

00:00:50.829 --> 00:00:55.589
 here are the doctors so interesting 

00:00:55.709 --> 00:01:04.140
 In principle, everything happened to Vasina for a long time. 

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:13.590
 played him 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:13.590
 here is the noise it turned out we estimate here op 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:17.670
 once and for all 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:38.220
 brittle stands behind st i hung and the most 

00:01:32.659 --> 00:01:44.039
 ordinary boxes used for frame 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:51.590
 300 and here, in principle , the song 30 also melts 

00:01:44.039 --> 00:02:00.030
 frame semi frame here is frame 300 

00:01:51.590 --> 00:02:03.409
 introducts take insert and look at 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:12.920
 easy here they are there frames 

00:02:03.409 --> 00:02:12.920
 fine it still remains a gap see 

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:25.200
 I would also like to tell you the size 

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:27.180
 the hull of what so here we look at 

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:36.920
 me lina 

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:47.640
 exactly 500 turned out 500 so here 

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:48.739
 let's see it turned out exactly 305 and 

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:53.549
 riding 

00:02:48.739 --> 00:02:59.390
 Well, that 's basically all I wanted 

00:02:53.549 --> 00:03:02.390
 tell what kind of hooks are there 

00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:02.390
 box 

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:21.940
 principle assembled and you can take it 

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:21.940
 use apiary remove once all 

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:29.560
 we insert frames we pull out in general I 

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:37.810
 satisfied wants so beautiful too 

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:37.810
 it turned out we appreciate
