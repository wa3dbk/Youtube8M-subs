the same way that a waypoint does you

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:40.010 
the same way that a waypoint does you
right-click<00:00:38.010> the<00:00:38.309> center<00:00:38.670> and<00:00:39.360> you<00:00:39.840> get<00:00:39.989> a

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
in island until we activate the center

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:19.670 
in island until we activate the center
of<00:01:17.369> the<00:01:17.580> river<00:01:17.729> and<00:01:18.200> the<00:01:19.200> first<00:01:19.409> thing<00:01:19.560> you'll

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.680 
of the river and the first thing you'll

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:20.990 
of the river and the first thing you'll
notice<00:01:19.860> is<00:01:20.100> that<00:01:20.159> the<00:01:20.369> center<00:01:20.670> goal<00:01:20.850> block

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000 
notice is that the center goal block

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:21.960 
notice is that the center goal block
gets

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:21.970 
gets

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:25.590 
gets
whatever<00:01:22.840> you<00:01:24.300> programming<00:01:25.300> a<00:01:25.480> new

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:25.600 
whatever you programming a new

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:27.000 
whatever you programming a new
destination<00:01:26.230> so<00:01:26.380> that's<00:01:26.530> something<00:01:26.710> to<00:01:26.920> be

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:27.010 
destination so that's something to be

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:29.640 
destination so that's something to be
aware<00:01:27.040> of<00:01:27.220> do<00:01:27.940> that<00:01:28.090> sparingly<00:01:28.630> and<00:01:29.320> when<00:01:29.560> you

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:29.650 
aware of do that sparingly and when you

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:32.520 
aware of do that sparingly and when you
activate<00:01:30.130> it<00:01:30.160> a<00:01:30.400> couple<00:01:30.670> of<00:01:30.760> things<00:01:30.940> happen<00:01:31.530> on

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:32.530 
activate it a couple of things happen on

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:34.740 
activate it a couple of things happen on
successful<00:01:33.100> activation<00:01:33.970> you<00:01:34.120> get<00:01:34.330> that<00:01:34.480> glass

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:34.750 
successful activation you get that glass

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:36.510 
successful activation you get that glass
sphere<00:01:35.170> that<00:01:35.380> occurs<00:01:35.680> around<00:01:35.710> you<00:01:36.160> and<00:01:36.310> in<00:01:36.400> the

the base point as such another
interesting<00:01:47.950> thing<00:01:48.070> to<00:01:48.760> note<00:01:48.970> is<00:01:49.210> that<00:01:49.240> like

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:49.570 
interesting thing to note is that like

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:54.990 
interesting thing to note is that like

input<00:02:00.670> location<00:02:01.000> will<00:02:01.300> be<00:02:01.330> at<00:02:01.570> the<00:02:01.690> top<00:02:01.900> of

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:02.110 
input location will be at the top of

input location will be at the top of
that<00:02:02.260> column<00:02:02.680> so<00:02:02.860> in<00:02:03.130> this<00:02:03.280> case<00:02:03.550> I<00:02:03.820> can

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:04.540 
that column so in this case I can

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:07.740 
that column so in this case I can
reactivate<00:02:05.080> this<00:02:05.350> room<00:02:05.560> and<00:02:06.310> because<00:02:07.270> there

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:07.750 
reactivate this room and because there

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:09.389 
reactivate this room and because there
was<00:02:07.869> a<00:02:07.900> solid<00:02:08.290> column<00:02:08.500> up<00:02:08.800> from<00:02:08.979> the<00:02:09.070> bottom<00:02:09.220> of

00:02:09.389 --> 00:02:09.399 
was a solid column up from the bottom of

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:13.050 
was a solid column up from the bottom of
the<00:02:09.520> face<00:02:09.670> point<00:02:10.980> when<00:02:11.980> to<00:02:12.190> steal<00:02:12.430> some<00:02:12.670> glass

the face point when to steal some glass

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:16.199 
the face point when to steal some glass
here<00:02:13.950> but<00:02:14.950> because<00:02:15.220> of<00:02:15.250> that<00:02:15.550> solid<00:02:15.970> column

00:02:16.199 --> 00:02:16.209 
here but because of that solid column

00:02:16.209 --> 00:02:18.840 
here but because of that solid column
and<00:02:16.510> the<00:02:17.140> face<00:02:17.740> island<00:02:18.190> went<00:02:18.400> all<00:02:18.610> the<00:02:18.640> way<00:02:18.760> up

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:18.850 
and the face island went all the way up

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:22.290 
and the face island went all the way up
to<00:02:19.090> the<00:02:19.180> top<00:02:19.390> of<00:02:19.810> that<00:02:20.260> column<00:02:21.030> this<00:02:22.030> is<00:02:22.090> a

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:43.180 

okie-dokie<00:02:41.990> so<00:02:42.140> we<00:02:42.260> built<00:02:42.470> our<00:02:42.620> active<00:02:43.010> here

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:43.190 
okie-dokie so we built our active here

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:44.980 
okie-dokie so we built our active here
and<00:02:43.370> here<00:02:43.520> we<00:02:43.640> have<00:02:43.760> it<00:02:43.880> encloses<00:02:44.120> it<00:02:44.420> yet<00:02:44.690> but

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:44.990 
and here we have it encloses it yet but

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:48.370 
and here we have it encloses it yet but
we'll<00:02:45.320> build<00:02:45.680> up<00:02:45.920> a<00:02:46.190> nice<00:02:46.550> bounce<00:02:47.060> column<00:02:47.570> in

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:48.380 
we'll build up a nice bounce column in

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:51.010 
we'll build up a nice bounce column in
the<00:02:48.620> middle<00:02:48.860> of<00:02:48.980> here<00:02:49.430> build<00:02:50.150> it<00:02:50.300> oversize

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:51.020 
the middle of here build it oversize

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:57.400 
the middle of here build it oversize
just<00:02:51.380> to<00:02:51.500> be<00:02:52.270> certain<00:02:53.270> activate<00:02:54.260> it<00:02:56.410> obstacles

just to be certain activate it obstacles

00:02:57.410 --> 00:02:58.690 
just to be certain activate it obstacles
at<00:02:57.560> your<00:02:57.710> destination<00:02:57.860> that's<00:02:58.340> an<00:02:58.520> error

with the face island that are blocking
it<00:03:03.110> in<00:03:03.650> this<00:03:03.800> particular<00:03:04.010> case<00:03:04.580> it's<00:03:05.240> because

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:05.590 
it in this particular case it's because

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:08.949 
it in this particular case it's because
the<00:03:06.590> this<00:03:07.190> islands<00:03:07.610> that<00:03:07.850> I<00:03:07.880> just<00:03:08.360> encoded<00:03:08.840> is

00:03:08.949 --> 00:03:08.959 
the this islands that I just encoded is

00:03:08.959 --> 00:03:12.220 
the this islands that I just encoded is
too<00:03:09.230> big<00:03:09.440> to<00:03:09.680> fit<00:03:09.830> in<00:03:09.980> that<00:03:10.130> gap<00:03:10.340> there<00:03:10.990> so<00:03:11.990> if

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:12.230 
too big to fit in that gap there so if

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:14.320 
too big to fit in that gap there so if
we<00:03:12.350> move<00:03:12.500> this<00:03:12.680> one<00:03:12.860> down<00:03:13.000> then<00:03:14.000> we'll<00:03:14.120> be<00:03:14.240> able

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:14.330 
we move this one down then we'll be able

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:16.860 
we move this one down then we'll be able
to<00:03:14.450> bounce<00:03:14.630> two<00:03:15.020> on<00:03:15.200> top<00:03:15.410> of<00:03:15.470> it<00:03:15.709> quite<00:03:16.160> happy<00:03:16.430> I

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:16.870 
to bounce two on top of it quite happy I

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:22.050 
to bounce two on top of it quite happy I
get<00:03:17.870> rid<00:03:17.959> of<00:03:18.020> these<00:03:18.140> extra<00:03:18.620> blocks<00:03:18.860> here<00:03:19.610> and

the faith island docks on Weaver are all

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:26.920 
the faith island docks on Weaver are all
built<00:03:25.459> for<00:03:25.700> one<00:03:25.850> size<00:03:26.120> and<00:03:26.480> they're<00:03:26.600> all<00:03:26.690> built

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:26.930 
built for one size and they're all built

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:29.020 
built for one size and they're all built
with<00:03:27.020> bouncing<00:03:27.590> in<00:03:27.680> mind<00:03:27.890> the<00:03:28.520> idea<00:03:28.790> being

00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:29.030 
with bouncing in mind the idea being

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:30.850 
with bouncing in mind the idea being
that<00:03:29.120> you<00:03:29.390> pop<00:03:29.600> in<00:03:29.780> now<00:03:30.200> you've<00:03:30.560> arrived<00:03:30.830> at

00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:30.860 
that you pop in now you've arrived at

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:32.680 
that you pop in now you've arrived at
the<00:03:31.100> parking<00:03:31.430> space<00:03:31.760> then<00:03:32.090> you<00:03:32.209> bounce<00:03:32.360> up<00:03:32.660> to

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:32.690 
the parking space then you bounce up to

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:35.170 
the parking space then you bounce up to
do<00:03:32.989> the<00:03:33.170> first<00:03:33.380> available<00:03:33.650> dock<00:03:34.070> and<00:03:34.430> then

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:35.180 
do the first available dock and then

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:39.970 
do the first available dock and then
you're<00:03:35.390> good<00:03:35.770> and<00:03:37.510> see<00:03:38.510> now<00:03:39.230> I<00:03:39.260> can<00:03:39.530> use<00:03:39.860> this

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:39.980 
you're good and see now I can use this

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:43.030 
you're good and see now I can use this
one<00:03:40.040> again<00:03:40.910> and<00:03:41.150> I'll<00:03:41.600> bounce<00:03:41.810> through<00:03:42.650> that

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:43.040 
one again and I'll bounce through that

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:46.210 
one again and I'll bounce through that
one<00:03:43.250> the<00:03:43.790> the<00:03:44.120> view<00:03:44.660> of<00:03:44.810> whatever<00:03:45.080> it<00:03:45.320> is<00:03:45.440> -<00:03:46.040> on

00:03:46.210 --> 00:03:46.220 
one the the view of whatever it is - on

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:50.380 
one the the view of whatever it is - on
top<00:03:46.430> of<00:03:46.459> it<00:03:46.720> and<00:03:47.720> so<00:03:47.959> forth<00:03:49.180> current<00:03:50.180> bounce

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:50.390 
top of it and so forth current bounce

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:52.600 
top of it and so forth current bounce
down<00:03:50.750> the<00:03:50.900> way<00:03:50.989> though<00:03:51.170> because<00:03:51.590> the<00:03:51.769> size<00:03:52.280> is

00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:52.610 
down the way though because the size is

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:56.020 
down the way though because the size is
too<00:03:53.209> big<00:03:53.239> for<00:03:53.810> that<00:03:54.200> so<00:03:55.190> I'll<00:03:55.400> share<00:03:55.670> another

00:03:56.020 --> 00:03:56.030 
too big for that so I'll share another

00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:58.479 
too big for that so I'll share another
trick<00:03:56.360> that<00:03:56.690> was<00:03:56.870> shared<00:03:57.350> with<00:03:57.470> me<00:03:57.680> and<00:03:58.100> that

00:03:58.479 --> 00:03:58.489 
trick that was shared with me and that

00:03:58.489 --> 00:04:01.449 
trick that was shared with me and that
trick<00:03:58.760> I<00:03:58.940> was<00:03:59.330> shown<00:03:59.810> is<00:04:00.080> this<00:04:00.590> you<00:04:00.860> get<00:04:01.040> water

00:04:01.449 --> 00:04:01.459 
trick I was shown is this you get water

00:04:01.459 --> 00:04:06.190 
trick I was shown is this you get water
here<00:04:02.060> and<00:04:03.489> now<00:04:04.489> beware<00:04:04.700> of<00:04:04.880> that<00:04:05.060> spread<00:04:05.900> you

here and now beware of that spread you
can<00:04:06.310> interfere<00:04:07.310> with<00:04:07.459> the<00:04:07.549> corners<00:04:07.910> of<00:04:08.030> the

00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:08.120 
can interfere with the corners of the

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:10.750 
can interfere with the corners of the
pattern<00:04:08.480> in<00:04:08.720> some<00:04:08.959> cases<00:04:09.200> not<00:04:10.160> in<00:04:10.340> this<00:04:10.459> case

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:10.760 
pattern in some cases not in this case

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:14.420 
pattern in some cases not in this case
so<00:04:11.150> should<00:04:11.600> be<00:04:11.720> alright

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:14.430 

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:18.390 

age<00:04:15.430> it<00:04:15.640> in<00:04:15.790> and<00:04:16.230> now<00:04:17.230> what<00:04:17.590> we<00:04:17.709> have<00:04:17.890> here<00:04:18.190> is

00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:18.400 
age it in and now what we have here is

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:21.270 
age it in and now what we have here is
whenever<00:04:18.880> we<00:04:19.359> have<00:04:19.900> to<00:04:20.140> pee<00:04:20.380> up<00:04:20.560> I'm<00:04:21.010> going<00:04:21.190> to

00:04:21.270 --> 00:04:21.280 
whenever we have to pee up I'm going to

00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:23.400 
whenever we have to pee up I'm going to
pause<00:04:21.609> this<00:04:21.820> video<00:04:22.030> and<00:04:22.420> move<00:04:22.600> this<00:04:22.870> island<00:04:23.290> to

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:23.410 
pause this video and move this island to

00:04:23.410 --> 00:04:26.370 
pause this video and move this island to
the<00:04:23.530> side<00:04:23.770> using<00:04:24.190> Pegasus<00:04:24.730> and<00:04:25.110> that's<00:04:26.110> that

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:26.380 
the side using Pegasus and that's that

00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:27.930 
the side using Pegasus and that's that
island<00:04:26.740> moved<00:04:27.010> somewhere<00:04:27.430> off<00:04:27.580> into<00:04:27.820> the

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:27.940 
island moved somewhere off into the

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:29.510 
island moved somewhere off into the
distance<00:04:28.090> doesn't<00:04:28.750> really<00:04:28.990> matter<00:04:29.170> where

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:29.520 
distance doesn't really matter where

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:31.740 
distance doesn't really matter where
okay<00:04:30.520> so<00:04:30.580> we've<00:04:30.820> got<00:04:30.850> water<00:04:31.090> pouring<00:04:31.480> out<00:04:31.630> at

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:31.750 
okay so we've got water pouring out at

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:33.230 
okay so we've got water pouring out at
the<00:04:31.810> bottom<00:04:32.080> and<00:04:32.260> that<00:04:32.530> means<00:04:32.770> whenever<00:04:33.010> I

00:04:33.230 --> 00:04:33.240 
the bottom and that means whenever I

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:37.830 
the bottom and that means whenever I
bounce<00:04:34.240> up<00:04:34.600> the<00:04:34.840> way<00:04:35.790> the<00:04:36.790> water<00:04:37.060> column<00:04:37.390> will

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:37.840 
bounce up the way the water column will

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:40.200 
bounce up the way the water column will
flicker<00:04:38.200> off<00:04:38.410> briefly<00:04:38.890> but<00:04:39.790> then<00:04:39.970> it<00:04:40.090> will

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:40.210 
flicker off briefly but then it will

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:41.790 
flicker off briefly but then it will
start<00:04:40.420> pouring<00:04:40.690> out<00:04:40.990> of<00:04:41.020> the<00:04:41.260> bottom<00:04:41.530> of<00:04:41.650> the

00:04:41.790 --> 00:04:41.800 
start pouring out of the bottom of the

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:43.440 
start pouring out of the bottom of the
new<00:04:41.950> faith<00:04:42.160> island<00:04:42.550> when<00:04:42.730> that<00:04:42.940> column<00:04:43.300> a

00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:43.450 
new faith island when that column a

00:04:43.450 --> 00:04:45.540 
new faith island when that column a
fully<00:04:44.050> reaches<00:04:44.350> the<00:04:44.470> bottom<00:04:44.770> would<00:04:45.310> be<00:04:45.460> able

00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:45.550 
fully reaches the bottom would be able

00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:46.800 
fully reaches the bottom would be able
to<00:04:45.700> bounce<00:04:45.850> again<00:04:46.240> it<00:04:46.450> will<00:04:46.540> be<00:04:46.630> able<00:04:46.720> to

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:46.810 
to bounce again it will be able to

00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:48.120 
to bounce again it will be able to
bounce<00:04:46.930> higher<00:04:47.290> and<00:04:47.620> higher<00:04:47.800> and<00:04:48.070> higher

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:48.130 
bounce higher and higher and higher

00:04:48.130 --> 00:04:51.650 
bounce higher and higher and higher
until<00:04:48.750> we<00:04:49.750> bounce<00:04:49.990> at<00:04:50.290> the<00:04:50.440> top<00:04:50.590> of<00:04:50.740> the<00:04:50.860> world

00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:51.660 
until we bounce at the top of the world

00:04:51.660 --> 00:04:54.659 
until we bounce at the top of the world
or<00:04:52.660> not<00:04:52.960> a<00:04:53.200> founding<00:04:53.740> member<00:04:53.800> of<00:04:54.040> that<00:04:54.220> bug<00:04:54.430> has

00:04:54.659 --> 00:04:54.669 
or not a founding member of that bug has

00:04:54.669 --> 00:04:56.940 
or not a founding member of that bug has
yet<00:04:54.850> been<00:04:54.880> fixed<00:04:55.360> that's<00:04:56.050> good<00:04:56.260> just<00:04:56.410> just<00:04:56.830> go

00:04:56.940 --> 00:04:56.950 
yet been fixed that's good just just go

00:04:56.950 --> 00:05:00.450 
yet been fixed that's good just just go
and<00:04:57.010> find<00:04:57.250> out<00:04:57.990> the<00:04:58.990> FT<00:04:59.680> people<00:05:00.040> it<00:05:00.220> will

00:05:00.450 --> 00:05:00.460 
and find out the FT people it will

00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:02.159 
and find out the FT people it will
transport<00:05:01.030> mobs<00:05:01.300> with<00:05:01.510> it<00:05:01.630> let's<00:05:01.840> get<00:05:01.960> some

00:05:02.159 --> 00:05:02.169 
transport mobs with it let's get some

00:05:02.169 --> 00:05:05.880 
transport mobs with it let's get some
eggs<00:05:02.440> that<00:05:02.980> gets<00:05:03.870> there<00:05:04.870> not<00:05:05.080> a<00:05:05.110> gasp<00:05:05.350> I<00:05:05.680> guess

00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:05.890 
eggs that gets there not a gasp I guess

00:05:05.890 --> 00:05:07.820 
eggs that gets there not a gasp I guess
would<00:05:06.040> be<00:05:06.160> a<00:05:06.190> bad<00:05:06.400> idea<00:05:06.430> as<00:05:06.880> get<00:05:07.120> some<00:05:07.360> slimes

00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:07.830 
would be a bad idea as get some slimes

00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:10.740 
would be a bad idea as get some slimes
okay<00:05:08.830> so<00:05:09.220> back<00:05:09.610> to<00:05:09.669> the<00:05:10.120> experimentation

00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:10.750 
okay so back to the experimentation

00:05:10.750 --> 00:05:13.110 
okay so back to the experimentation
process<00:05:11.350> there's<00:05:11.710> a<00:05:11.800> slime<00:05:12.250> that's<00:05:12.640> a<00:05:12.850> slime

00:05:13.110 --> 00:05:13.120 
process there's a slime that's a slime

00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:15.180 
process there's a slime that's a slime
we<00:05:13.270> can<00:05:13.450> use<00:05:13.690> waters<00:05:14.440> all<00:05:14.650> the<00:05:14.740> way<00:05:14.860> down<00:05:15.040> to

00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:15.190 
we can use waters all the way down to

00:05:15.190 --> 00:05:18.780 
we can use waters all the way down to
the<00:05:15.280> bottom<00:05:15.400> now<00:05:15.700> so<00:05:16.060> we<00:05:16.300> can<00:05:17.160> you<00:05:18.160> see<00:05:18.640> it

00:05:18.780 --> 00:05:18.790 
the bottom now so we can you see it

00:05:18.790 --> 00:05:20.700 
the bottom now so we can you see it
flops<00:05:19.120> up<00:05:19.330> probably<00:05:19.900> about<00:05:20.020> to<00:05:20.380> go<00:05:20.500> off<00:05:20.680> the

00:05:20.700 --> 00:05:20.710 
flops up probably about to go off the

00:05:20.710 --> 00:05:25.510 
flops up probably about to go off the
edge<00:05:22.020> hilariously

00:05:25.510 --> 00:05:25.520 

00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:28.839 

did<00:05:26.360> you<00:05:26.449> take<00:05:26.660> full<00:05:26.840> damage<00:05:27.020> fancy<00:05:27.919> that<00:05:28.069> but

00:05:28.839 --> 00:05:28.849 
did you take full damage fancy that but

00:05:28.849 --> 00:05:32.230 
did you take full damage fancy that but
there<00:05:29.000> we<00:05:29.090> go<00:05:30.280> glass<00:05:31.280> gets<00:05:31.580> left<00:05:31.789> behind

00:05:32.230 --> 00:05:32.240 
there we go glass gets left behind

00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:35.860 
there we go glass gets left behind
I<00:05:32.360> think<00:05:32.810> that<00:05:33.199> glass<00:05:33.819> duplication<00:05:34.819> thing<00:05:35.090> can

00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:35.870 
I think that glass duplication thing can

00:05:35.870 --> 00:05:38.839 
I think that glass duplication thing can
sometimes<00:05:36.289> occur<00:05:36.620> when<00:05:37.490> the

00:05:38.839 --> 00:05:38.849 
sometimes occur when the

00:05:38.849 --> 00:05:44.439 
sometimes occur when the
MTP<00:05:39.830> column<00:05:40.830> wraps<00:05:41.129> part<00:05:41.550> of<00:05:41.669> itself<00:05:41.999> but

00:05:44.439 --> 00:05:44.449 
MTP column wraps part of itself but

00:05:44.449 --> 00:05:46.369 
MTP column wraps part of itself but
usually<00:05:45.449> indicates<00:05:45.899> that<00:05:46.020> your<00:05:46.229> balance

00:05:46.369 --> 00:05:46.379 
usually indicates that your balance

00:05:46.379 --> 00:05:49.290 
usually indicates that your balance
pillar<00:05:46.830> is<00:05:47.129> too<00:05:47.399> short

00:05:49.290 --> 00:05:49.300 
pillar is too short

00:05:49.300 --> 00:05:52.200 
pillar is too short
okay<00:05:50.140> so<00:05:50.500> am<00:05:50.830> i<00:05:51.070> cheated<00:05:51.490> use<00:05:51.730> Pegasus

00:05:52.200 --> 00:05:52.210 
okay so am i cheated use Pegasus

00:05:52.210 --> 00:05:54.750 
okay so am i cheated use Pegasus
together<00:05:52.510> so<00:05:52.690> pretty<00:05:52.990> up<00:05:53.140> high<00:05:53.380> and<00:05:53.710> and<00:05:54.130> now

00:05:54.750 --> 00:05:54.760 
together so pretty up high and and now

00:05:54.760 --> 00:05:56.490 
together so pretty up high and and now
it's<00:05:54.940> just<00:05:55.030> a<00:05:55.180> case<00:05:55.360> of<00:05:55.420> performing<00:05:56.260> the

00:05:56.490 --> 00:05:56.500 
it's just a case of performing the

00:05:56.500 --> 00:06:02.280 
it's just a case of performing the
bounce<00:05:56.740> and<00:05:57.900> oh<00:05:59.700> yes<00:06:00.700> yes<00:06:01.060> I<00:06:01.330> had<00:06:01.810> an<00:06:01.930> accent

00:06:02.280 --> 00:06:02.290 
bounce and oh yes yes I had an accent

00:06:02.290 --> 00:06:03.960 
bounce and oh yes yes I had an accent
with<00:06:02.470> the<00:06:02.500> water<00:06:02.770> and<00:06:03.130> as<00:06:03.340> you<00:06:03.490> can<00:06:03.610> see<00:06:03.670> it

00:06:03.960 --> 00:06:03.970 
with the water and as you can see it

00:06:03.970 --> 00:06:06.690 
with the water and as you can see it
spilled<00:06:04.450> over<00:06:04.630> and<00:06:05.130> afflicted<00:06:06.130> the<00:06:06.280> corners

00:06:06.690 --> 00:06:06.700 
spilled over and afflicted the corners

00:06:06.700 --> 00:06:07.440 
spilled over and afflicted the corners
of<00:06:06.910> the<00:06:07.060> room

00:06:07.440 --> 00:06:07.450 
of the room

00:06:07.450 --> 00:06:09.300 
of the room
that's<00:06:07.870> meaning<00:06:08.230> that<00:06:08.440> the<00:06:08.590> pattern<00:06:08.950> is

00:06:09.300 --> 00:06:09.310 
that's meaning that the pattern is

00:06:09.310 --> 00:06:12.630 
that's meaning that the pattern is
broken<00:06:10.150> and<00:06:10.600> the<00:06:11.230> fake<00:06:11.410> point<00:06:11.680> temporarily

00:06:12.630 --> 00:06:12.640 
broken and the fake point temporarily
