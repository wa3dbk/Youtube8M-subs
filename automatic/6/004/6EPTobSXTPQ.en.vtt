00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:16.590 
can get all the way up to one point nine

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:20.390 
can get all the way up to one point nine
now<00:00:16.890> so<00:00:17.990> in<00:00:18.990> order<00:00:19.199> to<00:00:19.320> add<00:00:19.470> servers<00:00:19.859> I<00:00:19.980> F<00:00:20.130> Jews
