00:00:01.379 --> 00:00:06.989
 a dichotomous key is a tool that allows us to classify elements 

00:00:08.869 --> 00:00:10.929
 this tool 

00:00:10.929 --> 00:00:14.209
 is built for the first time 

00:00:14.209 --> 00:00:15.539
 biology 

00:00:15.539 --> 00:00:19.199
 to classify animal species and the card 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:24.170
 here you have for example a dichotomous key that allows you to classify 

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:27.029
 other pleasures 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:29.039
 animal rings 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:31.509
 we are going to pay we will try to talk 

00:00:31.509 --> 00:00:34.930
 to classify for example a frog 

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:36.780
 The first question 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:39.440
 He says he has hair 

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:41.390
 Well, if it were 

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:44.740
 the answer yes we would be talking about a mammal 

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:48.000
 but as the frog does not have hair 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.840
 we have to ask ourselves the following question 

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:52.230
 it has feathers 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:53.550
 Well, no 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:56.490
 we have to move on to this other question 

00:00:56.490 --> 00:00:58.550
 and jaws 

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:01.110
 mckiernan of cures the frog 

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:03.940
 Well yes it has jaws 

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:07.720
 but it has fins that we would be in this dilemma now 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:12.450
 well fins the frog does not have 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:14.860
 and his skin like on his skin 

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:19.590
 if it were dry with scaly subject talking about a reptile but that is not the case 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:20.400
 the branch 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:23.570
 but it has a moist and cynical skin 

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:28.799
 therefore the frog belongs to alak host houses 

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:32.200
 com has been able to observe 

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:35.200
 asking questions and answering that question 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:42.230
 about a certain animal we can classify it among the different 

00:01:42.229 --> 00:01:45.229
 classes that exists 

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:49.270
 a series of questions 

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:52.000
 about the characteristics 

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.000
 d a set of inventions 

00:01:56.570 --> 00:01:58.080
 they do not allow 

00:01:58.080 --> 00:01:59.820
 sort out 

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:02.820
 that set 

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:06.990
 this after that is called a dichotomous key
