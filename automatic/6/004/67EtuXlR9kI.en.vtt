on wearing it until I was like 12 at
which<00:01:25.920> point<00:01:25.950> it<00:01:26.340> was<00:01:26.490> way<00:01:26.820> too<00:01:26.850> small<00:01:27.329> for<00:01:27.630> me

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
which point it was way too small for me

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:31.940 
which point it was way too small for me
whenever<00:01:28.229> I<00:01:28.530> put<00:01:28.770> it<00:01:28.920> on<00:01:29.039> I<00:01:30.439> untucked<00:01:31.439> my<00:01:31.619> ears

from<00:01:32.640> it<00:01:32.880> so<00:01:33.299> that<00:01:33.329> they<00:01:33.659> were<00:01:33.719> like<00:01:34.020> sticking

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:34.680 
from it so that they were like sticking

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:38.090 
from it so that they were like sticking
straight<00:01:34.950> out<00:01:35.009> and<00:01:35.670> I<00:01:36.439> was<00:01:37.439> like<00:01:37.770> pretty<00:01:37.979> much

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.100 
straight out and I was like pretty much

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:39.950 
straight out and I was like pretty much
a<00:01:38.250> kite<00:01:38.579> because<00:01:38.939> my<00:01:39.149> ears<00:01:39.329> would<00:01:39.570> catch<00:01:39.810> in

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
a kite because my ears would catch in

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:41.630 
a kite because my ears would catch in
the<00:01:40.079> wind<00:01:40.259> and<00:01:40.500> they'd<00:01:40.740> flat<00:01:41.009> back<00:01:41.219> and<00:01:41.399> forth

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 
the wind and they'd flat back and forth

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:44.749 
the wind and they'd flat back and forth
and<00:01:41.850> it<00:01:41.939> was<00:01:42.090> just<00:01:42.329> hazardous<00:01:43.079> so<00:01:43.890> I'm<00:01:44.460> gonna

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:44.759

00:02:04.719 --> 00:02:04.729 
laugh because it's pretty ridiculous and

00:02:04.729 --> 00:02:07.399 
laugh because it's pretty ridiculous and
there's<00:02:05.729> a<00:02:05.789> specific<00:02:06.450> way<00:02:06.659> I<00:02:06.689> always<00:02:07.079> had<00:02:07.319> to

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:07.409 
there's a specific way I always had to

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:11.720 
there's a specific way I always had to
put<00:02:07.560> it<00:02:07.679> on<00:02:07.799> too<00:02:08.069> so<00:02:08.789> just<00:02:09.450> like<00:02:09.600> this<00:02:09.780> and<00:02:10.730> it's

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:11.730 
put it on too so just like this and it's

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:13.640 
put it on too so just like this and it's
kind<00:02:12.060> of<00:02:12.150> I<00:02:12.420> could<00:02:12.690> probably<00:02:12.870> use<00:02:13.319> it<00:02:13.500> as<00:02:13.620> a

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:13.650 
kind of I could probably use it as a

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:16.910 
kind of I could probably use it as a
bobcat<00:02:14.190> now<00:02:14.430> and<00:02:15.230> sometimes<00:02:16.230> i<00:02:16.470> just<00:02:16.500> took<00:02:16.860> my

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:16.920 
bobcat now and sometimes i just took my

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:19.780 
bobcat now and sometimes i just took my
hair<00:02:17.220> in<00:02:17.310> it<00:02:17.430> but<00:02:17.760> that's<00:02:18.569> kind<00:02:19.110> of<00:02:19.170> lame<00:02:19.350> so

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:19.790 
hair in it but that's kind of lame so

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:29.220

00:02:39.839 --> 00:02:39.849 
because she'd never seen them before so

00:02:39.849 --> 00:02:41.940

00:02:43.979 --> 00:02:43.989 
in and we were watching the Disney Land

00:02:43.989 --> 00:02:47.550 
in and we were watching the Disney Land
one<00:02:44.260> where<00:02:44.530> your<00:02:44.709> pass<00:02:45.430> expired<00:02:46.030> and<00:02:46.560> he

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:47.560 
one where your pass expired and he

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:49.259 
one where your pass expired and he
watched<00:02:47.769> almost<00:02:48.129> the<00:02:48.430> whole<00:02:48.549> thing<00:02:48.819> and<00:02:49.030> he

00:02:49.259 --> 00:02:49.269 
watched almost the whole thing and he

00:02:49.269 --> 00:02:51.839 
watched almost the whole thing and he
was<00:02:49.420> like<00:02:49.629> he<00:02:50.349> reminds<00:02:50.860> me<00:02:51.010> of<00:02:51.040> Kenneth<00:02:51.610> from

00:02:51.839 --> 00:02:51.849 
was like he reminds me of Kenneth from

00:02:51.849 --> 00:02:54.680 
was like he reminds me of Kenneth from
30<00:02:52.120> rock<00:02:52.209> and<00:02:52.569> I<00:02:52.780> was<00:02:52.959> like<00:02:53.170> okay<00:02:53.799> you<00:02:54.099> say<00:02:54.519> so

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:54.690 
30 rock and I was like okay you say so

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:57.539 
30 rock and I was like okay you say so
but<00:02:55.690> then<00:02:55.870> I<00:02:55.900> was<00:02:56.049> like<00:02:56.230> hmm<00:02:56.860> that's<00:02:57.250> pretty

00:02:57.539 --> 00:02:57.549 
but then I was like hmm that's pretty

00:02:57.549 --> 00:03:00.809 
but then I was like hmm that's pretty
weird<00:02:57.819> because<00:02:58.409> Peter<00:02:59.409> really<00:03:00.010> like<00:03:00.220> Tina<00:03:00.549> Fey

00:03:00.809 --> 00:03:00.819 
weird because Peter really like Tina Fey

00:03:00.819 --> 00:03:04.770 
weird because Peter really like Tina Fey
and<00:03:01.239> she's<00:03:01.510> in<00:03:01.690> 30<00:03:01.930> rock<00:03:02.200> and<00:03:03.329> my<00:03:04.329> dad<00:03:04.540> thought

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:04.780 
and she's in 30 rock and my dad thought

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:07.770 
and she's in 30 rock and my dad thought
he<00:03:04.959> looked<00:03:05.110> like<00:03:05.260> Kenneth<00:03:05.769> so<00:03:06.430> you<00:03:07.359> know<00:03:07.540> what

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:07.780 
he looked like Kenneth so you know what

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:11.970 
he looked like Kenneth so you know what
maybe<00:03:08.230> you<00:03:09.220> are<00:03:09.459> Jack<00:03:09.819> McBrayer<00:03:10.209> and<00:03:10.980> that

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:11.980 
maybe you are Jack McBrayer and that

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:13.410 
maybe you are Jack McBrayer and that
would<00:03:12.160> be<00:03:12.310> awesome<00:03:12.430> because<00:03:12.819> you<00:03:12.910> could<00:03:13.209> just

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:13.420 
would be awesome because you could just

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:17.509 
would be awesome because you could just
spend<00:03:13.599> all<00:03:13.810> of<00:03:13.930> this<00:03:14.739> time<00:03:14.980> with<00:03:15.879> Tina<00:03:16.120> Fey<00:03:16.359> and

00:03:17.509 --> 00:03:17.519 
spend all of this time with Tina Fey and

00:03:17.519 --> 00:03:22.979 
spend all of this time with Tina Fey and
then<00:03:18.720> your<00:03:19.720> videos<00:03:20.109> about<00:03:20.980> to<00:03:21.310> her<00:03:21.959> would<00:03:22.959> be

00:03:22.979 --> 00:03:22.989 
then your videos about to her would be

00:03:22.989 --> 00:03:29.880 
then your videos about to her would be
kind<00:03:23.410> of<00:03:23.530> be<00:03:23.620> irrelevant<00:03:23.890> but<00:03:24.400> that's<00:03:24.700> okay<00:03:28.890> so

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:29.890 
kind of be irrelevant but that's okay so

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:35.400 
kind of be irrelevant but that's okay so
