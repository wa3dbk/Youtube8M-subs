times did somebody come and the problem

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:41.310 
times did somebody come and the problem
with<00:00:39.760> that<00:00:39.790> metric<00:00:40.270> is<00:00:40.420> that<00:00:40.570> averages<00:00:40.989> lie

00:00:41.310 --> 00:00:41.320 
with that metric is that averages lie

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:44.310 
with that metric is that averages lie
and<00:00:41.739> and<00:00:42.070> and<00:00:42.340> they<00:00:43.180> tend<00:00:43.420> to<00:00:43.480> give<00:00:43.719> data<00:00:44.079> that

00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:44.320 
and and and they tend to give data that

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:46.139 
and and and they tend to give data that
is<00:00:44.410> not<00:00:44.559> very<00:00:44.590> actionable<00:00:45.219> so<00:00:45.579> the<00:00:45.730> report

00:00:46.139 --> 00:00:46.149 
is not very actionable so the report

00:00:46.149 --> 00:00:48.360
