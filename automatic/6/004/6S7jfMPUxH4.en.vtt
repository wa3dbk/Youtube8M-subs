00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:05.109
 Hello friends are like me here 

00:00:02.739 --> 00:00:07.269
 with a new video this time 

00:00:05.109 --> 00:00:09.639
 I bring like preparing a salad 

00:00:07.269 --> 00:00:13.250
 cucumber then we go with the 

00:00:09.639 --> 00:00:15.480
 ingredients that would be cucumber 

00:00:13.250 --> 00:00:17.200
 onion 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:20.560
 lemon 

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:24.039
 white dressing that could be ranch or 

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:27.339
 ranchero or blue cheese dressing 

00:00:24.039 --> 00:00:28.910
 and a little salt then we're going to 

00:00:27.339 --> 00:00:31.640
 prepare 

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:32.980
 the salad the first thing we should do 

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:35.800
 is 

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:39.970
 cut our bad peel our cucumber 

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:42.460
 and cut it into slices let's cut 

00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:44.329
 also apply a little onion and 

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:48.469
 we are going to 

00:00:44.329 --> 00:00:49.730
 to stir the other ingredients with 

00:00:48.469 --> 00:00:51.979
 our cucumber in our onion 

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:53.989
 then we go to the chopper and I'm going 

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:56.359
 to teach how it would be good friends already 

00:00:53.989 --> 00:00:58.609
 that we have our peeled cucumber and 

00:00:56.359 --> 00:01:03.110
 cut into slices as they see it 

00:00:58.609 --> 00:01:05.540
 Now let's cut a lemon 

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:09.080
 we cut the lemon 

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:10.480
 and in a bowl in a bowl as well 

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:13.010
 this 

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:15.590
 in a dish compare soup 

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:18.890
 you see here what is the 

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:22.070
 chopped onion that they throw to him we go to 

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:23.540
 let's remove the nugget first 

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:27.590
 animal 

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:31.210
 we do not want our salad to have 

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:34.210
 the nuggets there we are going to take a lemon 

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:34.210
 full 

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:40.710
 we removed this the other half 

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:50.179
 very well 

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:53.159
 and we are going to throw what is ours 

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:56.000
 our dressing if I have a ranch 

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:58.770
 here or rancher as you want to tell him 

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:01.610
 As I repeat, it can be 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:05.580
 this the range 

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:09.620
 it is roughly calculates a spoonful 

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:09.620
 that is, he can do this 

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:16.890
 the range then 

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:19.820
 when we already have all this we are going to 

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:19.820
 put our cucumbers 

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:31.050
 and put our here goes a cucumber that 

00:02:29.129 --> 00:02:33.330
 it's a pretty small pine defense 

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:35.610
 it's so big and we're going to need to 

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:37.370
 this 

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:40.760
 a spoon 

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:43.819
 and we're going to add salt to the taste that 

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:46.030
 we have our by throwing a little 

00:02:43.819 --> 00:02:46.030
 Salt 

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:51.370
 a little 

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:54.500
 and let's stir with our spoon 

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:56.450
 in the middle 

00:02:54.500 --> 00:03:01.150
 are of twists and turns can be 

00:02:56.450 --> 00:03:01.150
 add a little parsley too for 

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:07.650
 have a better flavor but the truth is 

00:03:05.329 --> 00:03:10.920
 that as we are preparing it 

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:15.380
 it's pretty good then 

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:15.380
 we finished our salad 

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:19.900
 and so it would be 

00:03:20.069 --> 00:03:26.870
 our cucumber salad 

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:28.220
 you can try it if you feel that it is 

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:29.850
 it takes a little bit you can add 

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:31.580
 lemon 

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:34.020
 or if you need a little more dressing 

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:39.460
 but I recommend you say a lemon 

00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:41.740
 of those remains that are not so big 

00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:44.680
 if they use a large lemon made in the middle 

00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:47.580
 lemon and our dressing 

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:50.890
 add a big spoonful then 

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:51.670
 I hope you like it and it will be until 

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:53.820
 next 

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:53.820
 bye
