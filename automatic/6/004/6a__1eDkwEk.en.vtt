 and then you live here it's welcome but the video 

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:11.280
 this time guys 

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:15.150
 This is a historical landmark video by 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:17.789
 that because I as you can see already 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:19.890
 I do not belong to this place to give a more 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:23.850
 turn of the 11 shown 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:26.580
 it looks like a bad guy passed by and stole 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:28.619
 everything I had was almost nothing and 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:31.920
 stole all my clothes or 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:33.540
 none that have almost no clothes but I 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:35.670
 I took the computer 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:39.719
 I took everything that was my guard from inside 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:41.820
 from the car and I'm leaving soon 

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:45.059
 an adventure in adventure 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:47.129
 I will live alone for the first time will 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:51.690
 become a semi-adult because you always 

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:53.520
 a little between a child and indeed 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:55.770
 this video has two purposes 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:57.480
 The first is to warn you that since I was 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:59.579
 traveling I will go through a phase of 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:01.949
 I rented a flat there in 

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:03.809
 I'm going to take a while, maybe. 

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:05.460
 to post video or maybe not 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:09.360
 get a hotel internet las and there 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:11.280
 You do and if I miss a few days video 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:13.770
 Forgive me that 's why she's going 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:15.090
 be a time-consuming process but 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:17.430
 I think in a week it will give everything 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:19.619
 okay but I'll try to continue 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:22.439
 to provide every day I'm taking 

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:25.470

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:28.140
