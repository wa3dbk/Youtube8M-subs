to need a weapon of the same type that

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:46.340 
to need a weapon of the same type that
consumes<00:00:44.280> more<00:00:44.520> than<00:00:44.579> 1<00:00:44.789> M<00:00:44.940> up<00:00:45.030> is<00:00:45.180> shot<00:00:45.360> so<00:00:46.230> the

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350

light<00:00:46.500> drums<00:00:46.770> and<00:00:46.950> the<00:00:47.010> soul<00:00:47.219> rifles<00:00:47.579> so<00:00:47.820> we're

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
light drums and the soul rifles so we're

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:49.310 
light drums and the soul rifles so we're
going<00:00:48.059> to<00:00:48.149> use<00:00:48.270> a<00:00:48.300> Bearcat<00:00:48.510> here<00:00:48.899> because<00:00:49.170> it

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320 
going to use a Bearcat here because it

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:51.799 
going to use a Bearcat here because it
consumes<00:00:49.680> 6<00:00:49.980> ml<00:00:50.280> per<00:00:50.370> shot<00:00:50.610> let's<00:00:51.510> say<00:00:51.629> you're

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809 
consumes 6 ml per shot let's say you're

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:53.779 
consumes 6 ml per shot let's say you're
going<00:00:51.960> to<00:00:51.989> use<00:00:52.199> a<00:00:52.230> stinger<00:00:52.829> then<00:00:53.250> you<00:00:53.520> can<00:00:53.699> use

00:00:53.779 --> 00:00:53.789 
going to use a stinger then you can use

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:55.189 
going to use a stinger then you can use
a<00:00:53.820> herald<00:00:54.239> because<00:00:54.480> it<00:00:54.629> consumes<00:00:54.899> more<00:00:55.110> the

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
a herald because it consumes more the

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:58.220 
a herald because it consumes more the
one<00:00:55.289> aim<00:00:55.440> up<00:00:55.530> a<00:00:55.620> shot<00:00:55.829> and<00:00:57.079> anything<00:00:58.079> works

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
one aim up a shot and anything works

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:00.590 
one aim up a shot and anything works
like<00:00:58.410> I<00:00:58.500> said<00:00:58.680> so<00:00:58.949> and<00:00:59.520> you're<00:01:00.059> also<00:01:00.239> going<00:01:00.510> to

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
like I said so and you're also going to

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:02.569 
like I said so and you're also going to
need<00:01:00.809> a<00:01:01.050> flat<00:01:01.469> off<00:01:01.680> rocket<00:01:01.980> launcher<00:01:02.219> because

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
need a flat off rocket launcher because

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:04.100 
need a flat off rocket launcher because
we<00:01:02.760> need<00:01:02.910> to<00:01:03.059> do<00:01:03.180> the<00:01:03.329> infinite<00:01:03.719> ammo<00:01:03.899> glitch

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
we need to do the infinite ammo glitch

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:06.050 
we need to do the infinite ammo glitch
so<00:01:04.619> obviously<00:01:05.040> this<00:01:05.309> isn't<00:01:05.549> going<00:01:05.820> to<00:01:05.909> be<00:01:05.970> a

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
so obviously this isn't going to be a

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:07.520 
so obviously this isn't going to be a
legit<00:01:06.479> kill<00:01:06.689> or<00:01:06.810> anything<00:01:06.990> it's<00:01:07.290> something

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
legit kill or anything it's something

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:09.050 
legit kill or anything it's something

go ahead and get infinite ammo so we're

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:16.460 
go ahead and get infinite ammo so we're
going<00:01:14.640> to<00:01:14.700> do<00:01:14.820> that<00:01:15.000> now<00:01:15.210> Barbara<00:01:16.200> did<00:01:16.380> a

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
shoot infinitely obviously we can't

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:35.780 
shoot infinitely obviously we can't
money<00:01:34.170> shot<00:01:34.380> yet<00:01:34.590> because<00:01:34.890> I'll<00:01:35.430> show<00:01:35.490> you<00:01:35.729> how

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:35.790 
money shot yet because I'll show you how

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400 
to do that in a second so what we're

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:40.940 
to do that in a second so what we're
going<00:01:38.490> to<00:01:38.549> do<00:01:38.729> is<00:01:38.970> gun<00:01:39.180> silk<00:01:39.479> and<00:01:39.720> a<00:01:40.470> singe

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
going to do is gun silk and a singe

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:42.530 
going to do is gun silk and a singe
beacon<00:01:41.130> so<00:01:41.460> we're<00:01:41.790> going<00:01:41.909> to<00:01:42.030> shoot<00:01:42.360> our

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:42.540 
beacon so we're going to shoot our

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:44.810 
beacon so we're going to shoot our
Bearcat<00:01:42.990> and<00:01:43.619> what<00:01:43.740> that'll<00:01:43.920> do<00:01:44.130> is<00:01:44.159> cause<00:01:44.610> our

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:44.820 
Bearcat and what that'll do is cause our

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:46.789 
Bearcat and what that'll do is cause our
ammo<00:01:45.090> to<00:01:45.390> go<00:01:45.509> to<00:01:45.570> a<00:01:45.720> negative<00:01:45.899> value<00:01:46.229> dropping

us<00:01:46.920> to<00:01:47.070> zero<00:01:47.430> and<00:01:47.700> causing<00:01:48.659> the<00:01:48.840> electron<00:01:49.259> to

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:49.409 
us to zero and causing the electron to

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:50.840 
us to zero and causing the electron to
impanel<00:01:49.619> a<00:01:49.860> money<00:01:50.070> shot<00:01:50.280> because<00:01:50.490> of<00:01:50.759> the
