00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.560
 which is already more accurate which year of school 

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:06.299
 consists of two meat and explains why 

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:08.550
 it still turns if you connect 

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:14.849
 the battery is so simple how are you 

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:16.500
 say multiplicity that is coherence 

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:19.650
 which creates these good ones 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:21.330
 prerequisites for impulse pause 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:23.279
 proper uniqueness of the engine 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:25.199
 shkondina she is in everything firstly herself 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:26.789
 the engine is in the wheel and the seat 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:27.960
 absolutely does not occupy the basis of everything 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:28.680
 this case is an ordinary bicycle 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:30.960
 children 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:33.660
 But these batteries here are enough for 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:36.360
 then to go 30 40 kilometers then 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:38.130
 have practically cross 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:40.050
 the car reaches about speed 

00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:45.630
 holidays for those who love 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:47.370
 hot can and hot he invented 

00:00:45.630 --> 00:00:48.240
 your engine eighties then 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:50.190
 ten patent 

00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:51.390
 correspondence with the scientific community was like 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:53.670
 like in different languages 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:56.520
 he doesnâ€™t work 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:58.830
 It happens why you write equidistant 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:00.809
 magnets what it is I answer 

00:00:58.830 --> 00:01:02.970
 equidistant magnets are magnets 

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:04.559
 deleted at an equal distance from all 

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:06.510
 such correspondence gates we want years 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:08.340
 The volitional decision of the Minister for 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:09.840
 inventions cases after reading all reports on 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:12.270
 that it can't work 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:13.590
 forces his wheelchair she gets up on 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:15.570
 give the gas the buck 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:16.830
 leading experts summoned to the carpet and 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:18.840
 ordered to patent 

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:20.610
 he remained his garage with 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:22.470
 machine tools magnetic drawings 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:24.210
 only now research director 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:26.190
 international company man in gray 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:28.229
 a suit there on the road is an american 

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:29.940
 united a bunch of like this lacked school 

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:31.229
 narrow motor great pleasure 

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:33.509
 riding his bike 

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:35.700
 Vitalievna immediately realized that this wheel 

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:37.740
 inject goes for two times longer 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:38.369
 of all six parts and accelerates as 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:40.290
 motorcycle 

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:42.450
 it means here millions you sit down on 

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:45.240
 bike and it's like a rocket like a ferrara 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:47.729
 that is, and take off this moment 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:50.130
 which we call zip factor or count 

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:52.260
 factor this is a huge advantage 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:54.720
 which will allow anand to build good 

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:56.460
 affiliate shkondin shows all 

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:58.290
 the palette and then ordered the entire stroller 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:59.940
 a society of older Japanese they have a pension 

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:02.250
 nice and they are very mobile 

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:04.500
 this electric car drive 80 kilometers 

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:06.570
 an hour it will buy or profintern 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:08.670
 emulators from moscow to petersburg he 

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:10.110
 again ready to show everything and prove it 

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:12.600
 power engine is not applicable 

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:15.830
 here is another bike editorial machine 

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:15.830
 weighs one and a half tons 

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:23.700
 sustainability who is not the case reduced from 

00:02:21.959 --> 00:02:25.770
 garage bullets crowned everything became a business 

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:28.160
 this year schoolchildren and motors start 

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:28.160
 conquer and
