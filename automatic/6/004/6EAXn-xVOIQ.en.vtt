can see cow manure and the cal- in

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:01.280 
can see cow manure and the cal- in
itself<00:00:59.280> is<00:00:59.490> a<00:00:59.520> lot<00:01:00.120> of<00:01:00.240> diversity<00:01:00.600> providing

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:01.290 
itself is a lot of diversity providing

00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:04.030 
itself is a lot of diversity providing
the<00:01:01.380> pasture<00:01:01.770> they're<00:01:01.950> eating<00:01:02.310> is<00:01:02.460> diverse

that might be worth adding is a little
bit<00:01:29.460> of<00:01:29.550> moldy<00:01:29.880> Lusa<00:01:30.270> and<00:01:30.420> high<00:01:30.540> if<00:01:30.720> you<00:01:30.900> have

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:31.080 
bit of moldy Lusa and high if you have

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:34.219 
bit of moldy Lusa and high if you have
any<00:01:31.200> that<00:01:31.980> around<00:01:32.280> yeah<00:01:32.520> yeah<00:01:33.270> little<00:01:33.600> bill

doctor<00:01:35.000> I've<00:01:36.000> done<00:01:36.510> that<00:01:36.690> in<00:01:36.840> the<00:01:36.870> past<00:01:36.960> a<00:01:37.350> few

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.530 
doctor I've done that in the past a few

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:39.410 
doctor I've done that in the past a few
years<00:01:37.710> ago<00:01:37.920> and<00:01:38.250> I<00:01:38.310> and<00:01:38.729> I<00:01:38.790> saw<00:01:39.030> the<00:01:39.090> worms

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
years ago and I and I saw the worms

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:41.149 
years ago and I and I saw the worms
really<00:01:39.870> enjoyed<00:01:40.170> it<00:01:40.320> they<00:01:40.500> really<00:01:40.740> did<00:01:40.950> well

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
really enjoyed it they really did well

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:45.070 
really enjoyed it they really did well
and<00:01:41.460> probably<00:01:42.360> good<00:01:42.720> for<00:01:42.750> building<00:01:43.340> he<00:01:44.340> was

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:45.080 
and probably good for building he was

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:48.050 
and probably good for building he was
because<00:01:46.080> the<00:01:46.290> they<00:01:47.070> really<00:01:47.370> liked<00:01:47.549> the<00:01:47.670> humans

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060 
because the they really liked the humans

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:51.860 
because the they really liked the humans
and<00:01:48.150> the<00:01:48.990> loosen<00:01:49.680> and<00:01:50.030> it<00:01:51.030> seems<00:01:51.299> to<00:01:51.390> generate

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:51.870 
and the loosen and it seems to generate

00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:53.810 
and the loosen and it seems to generate
a<00:01:51.900> lot<00:01:52.140> more<00:01:52.290> activity<00:01:52.530> in<00:01:52.950> them<00:01:53.100> and<00:01:53.580> will

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:53.820 
a lot more activity in them and will

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:57.080 
a lot more activity in them and will
also<00:01:53.970> increase<00:01:54.390> your<00:01:54.600> funk<00:01:54.840> of<00:01:54.990> content<00:01:56.090> okay

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:57.090 
also increase your funk of content okay

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:01.580 
also increase your funk of content okay
right<00:01:57.780> out<00:01:57.990> well<00:01:58.830> let's<00:01:59.040> worth<00:01:59.250> knowing
