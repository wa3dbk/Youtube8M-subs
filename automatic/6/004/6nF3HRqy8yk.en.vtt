I've heard great reviews from people

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:07.080 
I've heard great reviews from people
that<00:03:04.990> have<00:03:05.140> used<00:03:05.410> them<00:03:05.680> on<00:03:05.920> stuff<00:03:06.700> like<00:03:06.760> our

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:07.090 
that have used them on stuff like our

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:10.790 
that have used them on stuff like our
ones<00:03:07.360> and<00:03:07.720> fire<00:03:08.650> blades<00:03:09.010> and<00:03:09.310> again<00:03:09.970> they

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:10.800 
ones and fire blades and again they

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:12.720 
ones and fire blades and again they
typically<00:03:11.800> tend<00:03:12.040> to<00:03:12.160> mention<00:03:12.340> that<00:03:12.580> the

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:12.730 
typically tend to mention that the

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:17.160 
typically tend to mention that the
profile<00:03:13.180> feels<00:03:13.540> a<00:03:13.690> lot<00:03:13.810> flatter<00:03:14.550> than<00:03:16.170> stuff

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:17.170 
profile feels a lot flatter than stuff

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:19.680 
profile feels a lot flatter than stuff
like<00:03:17.380> the<00:03:17.530> BT<00:03:17.830> 83<00:03:18.370> so<00:03:18.640> you<00:03:19.240> do<00:03:19.390> have<00:03:19.600> this

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:19.690 
like the BT 83 so you do have this

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:21.450 
like the BT 83 so you do have this
feeling<00:03:19.930> of<00:03:20.170> almost<00:03:20.530> starting<00:03:21.040> to<00:03:21.160> tumble

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:21.460 
feeling of almost starting to tumble

00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:22.980 
feeling of almost starting to tumble
into<00:03:21.760> the<00:03:21.880> corners<00:03:22.300> once<00:03:22.450> you<00:03:22.600> start<00:03:22.810> pushing

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:22.990 
into the corners once you start pushing

00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:27.080 
into the corners once you start pushing
on<00:03:23.170> the<00:03:23.790> push<00:03:24.790> in<00:03:24.940> the<00:03:25.030> lean<00:03:25.210> angles<00:03:25.630> a<00:03:25.720> bit

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:27.090 
on the push in the lean angles a bit

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:31.020 
on the push in the lean angles a bit
would<00:03:28.090> I<00:03:28.120> recommend<00:03:29.050> them<00:03:29.410> yes<00:03:30.160> to<00:03:30.790> anyone

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:31.030 
would I recommend them yes to anyone

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:33.410 
would I recommend them yes to anyone
that<00:03:31.240> is<00:03:31.330> looking<00:03:31.360> for<00:03:31.750> sports<00:03:31.990> touring<00:03:32.320> tires

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:33.420 
that is looking for sports touring tires

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:35.760 
that is looking for sports touring tires
especially<00:03:34.420> as<00:03:34.720> I<00:03:34.990> think<00:03:35.050> Kylie's<00:03:35.560> got<00:03:35.680> an

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:35.770 
especially as I think Kylie's got an

00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:38.580 
especially as I think Kylie's got an
offer<00:03:35.890> on<00:03:36.070> now<00:03:36.310> where<00:03:36.550> you<00:03:36.700> get<00:03:36.940> a<00:03:37.600> Friedan<00:03:38.290> EC

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:38.590 
offer on now where you get a Friedan EC

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:42.120 
offer on now where you get a Friedan EC
back<00:03:39.190> protector<00:03:39.820> when<00:03:40.270> you<00:03:40.450> buy<00:03:40.810> a<00:03:40.840> pair<00:03:41.290> so

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:42.130 
back protector when you buy a pair so

00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:47.180 
back protector when you buy a pair so
that's<00:03:42.370> definitely<00:03:42.640> worth<00:03:43.060> looking<00:03:43.480> at<00:03:46.080> but

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:47.190 
that's definitely worth looking at but

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:50.190 
that's definitely worth looking at but
personally<00:03:48.190> I<00:03:48.490> don't<00:03:48.940> think<00:03:49.450> that<00:03:50.080> they

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:50.200 
personally I don't think that they

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:52.260 
personally I don't think that they
complement<00:03:50.740> the<00:03:50.830> street<00:03:51.100> triple<00:03:51.310> very<00:03:52.090> well

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:52.270 
complement the street triple very well

00:03:52.270 --> 00:03:57.810 
complement the street triple very well
at<00:03:52.390> all<00:03:54.150> if<00:03:55.150> I<00:03:55.330> show<00:03:55.570> you<00:03:55.830> where<00:03:56.830> the<00:03:56.980> chicken

00:03:57.810 --> 00:03:57.820 
at all if I show you where the chicken

00:03:57.820 --> 00:04:01.980 
at all if I show you where the chicken
strips<00:03:58.180> are<00:03:58.450> the<00:03:59.260> kind<00:03:59.530> of<00:03:59.590> on<00:03:59.740> the<00:03:59.950> a<00:04:00.780> of<00:04:01.780> the

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:01.990 
strips are the kind of on the a of the

00:04:01.990 --> 00:04:04.470 
strips are the kind of on the a of the
angel<00:04:02.380> just<00:04:02.590> underneath<00:04:02.860> the<00:04:03.070> a<00:04:03.480> that's

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:04.480 
angel just underneath the a that's

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:06.930 
angel just underneath the a that's
scraping<00:04:05.170> pegs<00:04:05.500> so<00:04:06.220> as<00:04:06.310> you<00:04:06.460> can<00:04:06.580> see<00:04:06.730> there's

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:06.940 
scraping pegs so as you can see there's

00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:12.030 
scraping pegs so as you can see there's
a<00:04:07.000> really<00:04:08.040> peculiar<00:04:09.040> profile<00:04:09.640> on<00:04:09.760> here<00:04:10.980> so<00:04:11.980> if

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:12.040 
a really peculiar profile on here so if

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:14.160 
a really peculiar profile on here so if
you're<00:04:12.220> really<00:04:12.580> into<00:04:12.880> pushing<00:04:13.270> your<00:04:13.390> bike<00:04:13.570> in

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:14.170 
you're really into pushing your bike in

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:18.630 
you're really into pushing your bike in
the<00:04:14.430> dry<00:04:15.900> then<00:04:16.900> I<00:04:17.200> think<00:04:17.560> these<00:04:18.190> times<00:04:18.489> will

00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:18.640 
the dry then I think these times will

00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:20.729 
the dry then I think these times will
disappoint<00:04:19.030> you<00:04:19.270> I'm<00:04:19.900> certainly<00:04:20.410> going<00:04:20.650> to

00:04:20.729 --> 00:04:20.739 
disappoint you I'm certainly going to

00:04:20.739 --> 00:04:24.240 
disappoint you I'm certainly going to
consider<00:04:22.080> moving<00:04:23.080> back<00:04:23.290> to<00:04:23.710> a<00:04:23.740> more<00:04:23.920> sport

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:24.250 
consider moving back to a more sport

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:28.470 
consider moving back to a more sport
orientated<00:04:25.060> tire<00:04:25.270> in<00:04:25.900> the<00:04:26.080> future<00:04:27.120> and<00:04:28.120> having

00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:28.480 
orientated tire in the future and having

00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:31.200 
orientated tire in the future and having
to<00:04:28.600> take<00:04:28.720> it<00:04:28.870> a<00:04:28.930> lot<00:04:29.020> easier<00:04:29.380> in<00:04:29.470> the<00:04:29.560> wet<00:04:29.940> but<00:04:30.940> I

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:31.210 
to take it a lot easier in the wet but I

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:33.590 
to take it a lot easier in the wet but I
mean<00:04:31.600> they've<00:04:31.780> never<00:04:32.020> let<00:04:32.230> me<00:04:32.380> down<00:04:32.530> they<00:04:32.770> do

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:33.600 
mean they've never let me down they do

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:38.900 
mean they've never let me down they do
like<00:04:34.600> I<00:04:34.630> say<00:04:34.930> attract<00:04:35.320> punctures<00:04:35.980> they<00:04:36.940> do

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:38.910 
like I say attract punctures they do

00:04:38.910 --> 00:04:41.790 
like I say attract punctures they do
behave<00:04:39.910> really<00:04:40.270> badly<00:04:40.660> on<00:04:40.990> stuff<00:04:41.350> like<00:04:41.440> loose

00:04:41.790 --> 00:04:41.800 
behave really badly on stuff like loose

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:47.460 
behave really badly on stuff like loose
gravel<00:04:42.310> and<00:04:44.460> they<00:04:45.460> tend<00:04:45.940> to<00:04:46.360> slip<00:04:47.170> and<00:04:47.380> slide

00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:47.470 
gravel and they tend to slip and slide

00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:50.100 
gravel and they tend to slip and slide
even<00:04:47.890> if<00:04:48.160> there's<00:04:48.340> just<00:04:48.400> a<00:04:48.610> bit<00:04:48.880> of<00:04:49.210> dirt<00:04:49.810> on

00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:50.110 
even if there's just a bit of dirt on

00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:53.740 
even if there's just a bit of dirt on
the<00:04:50.560> road<00:04:50.710> when<00:04:51.220> you<00:04:51.340> get<00:04:51.490> on<00:04:51.580> the<00:04:51.670> power<00:04:51.970> and

00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:53.750 
the road when you get on the power and

00:04:53.750 --> 00:04:56.710 
the road when you get on the power and
but<00:04:54.620> there<00:04:55.160> decade<00:04:55.760> I<00:04:55.970> think<00:04:56.180> the<00:04:56.240> mileage<00:04:56.570> is

00:04:56.710 --> 00:04:56.720 
but there decade I think the mileage is

00:04:56.720 --> 00:04:59.320 
but there decade I think the mileage is
fantastic<00:04:57.380> again<00:04:57.620> I<00:04:57.670> certainly<00:04:58.670> anything<00:04:59.030> up

00:04:59.320 --> 00:04:59.330 
fantastic again I certainly anything up

00:04:59.330 --> 00:05:06.190 
fantastic again I certainly anything up
to<00:04:59.540> 9<00:04:59.840> K<00:05:01.450> which<00:05:02.450> seem<00:05:02.750> plausible<00:05:04.870> but<00:05:05.870> yeah<00:05:06.170> I

00:05:06.190 --> 00:05:06.200 
to 9 K which seem plausible but yeah I

00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:08.980 
to 9 K which seem plausible but yeah I
mean<00:05:06.590> that's<00:05:06.740> my<00:05:06.950> thoughts<00:05:07.250> so<00:05:07.660> great<00:05:08.660> for

00:05:08.980 --> 00:05:08.990 
mean that's my thoughts so great for

00:05:08.990 --> 00:05:11.740 
mean that's my thoughts so great for
maybe<00:05:09.320> something<00:05:09.710> like<00:05:10.010> a<00:05:10.180> CBR<00:05:11.180> 600<00:05:11.630> or

00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:11.750 
maybe something like a CBR 600 or

00:05:11.750 --> 00:05:17.100 
maybe something like a CBR 600 or
something<00:05:11.990> that<00:05:13.060> doesn't<00:05:14.860> want<00:05:15.860> such

00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:17.110 
something that doesn't want such

00:05:17.110 --> 00:05:20.260 
something that doesn't want such
