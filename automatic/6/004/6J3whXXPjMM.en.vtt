00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:17.710
 from here 

00:00:12.959 --> 00:00:21.670
 flower all good day today i want 

00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:25.060
 I will offer you a choice of scythes 

00:00:21.670 --> 00:00:26.890
 do it on myself and the same braids I 

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:30.400
 gonna do on my daughter 

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:33.850
 so let's get started for a start you turn over 

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:39.449
 hair on one side and carefully them 

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:41.520
 combing further inside 

00:00:39.449 --> 00:00:45.219
 separate strands of hair 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:47.520
 it will be your next design 

00:00:45.219 --> 00:00:47.520
 spit 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:57.969
 you remove the strand 

00:00:52.420 --> 00:01:01.449
 wherever you need and start to weave 

00:00:57.969 --> 00:01:06.400
 the most ordinary course that is divide 

00:01:01.449 --> 00:01:13.200
 hair into three parts and start them 

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:13.200
 weave into the usual course 

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:24.259
 and here is the part that goes with you 

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:27.189
 top down with it, you have to separate 

00:01:24.259 --> 00:01:27.189
 a strand of hair 

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:35.740
 bind again and separate again 

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:35.740
 a strand of hair 

00:01:38.079 --> 00:01:47.649
 once again and before the strand and so on until 

00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:47.649
 the end of your spit 

00:01:54.300 --> 00:02:02.760
 then we do the course a little by volume 

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:05.390
 I pull each link with one and with 

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:05.390
 the other side 

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:17.410
 now we take that hello hair 

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:21.340
 which left us without work I will 

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:25.450
 do on themselves harness we share a nice two 

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:27.580
 pieces and start spinning them each 

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:30.670
 strand separately in the same 

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:33.420
 side and twist between each other in 

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:36.099
 opposite side 

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:39.910
 when we get to 

00:02:36.099 --> 00:02:44.049
 the strands that we had were free and 

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:46.630
 we screw it in our harness and press it 

00:02:44.049 --> 00:02:49.410
 Spit to this harness tightly lay on 

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:49.410
 our spit 

00:02:50.519 --> 00:02:55.599
 so we scrolled on each strand 

00:02:53.349 --> 00:02:57.720
 screwing loose strand to it 

00:02:55.599 --> 00:02:57.720
 braids 

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:12.140
 instead of harness can be quite calm 

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:16.000
 work tape also you can place 

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:21.860
 harness make braid which i will show you 

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:24.410
 In the next part of the video the thickness of the harnesses 

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:27.530
 you may also be adjusted, it can 

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:31.100
 be thinner thickness may be thicker 

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:34.280
 braids can also adjust and so here 

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:38.240
 I got this braid now I 

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:40.880
 I'll show you the second option and even the braids we 

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:45.290
 already done upstairs daughter's suit now 

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:47.840
 we begin to weave the usual course for 

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:51.230
 this, I again divided the hair into three 

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:55.000
 parts and also begin to weave 

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:55.000
 leave loose strands 

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:05.610
 here is the same strand each strand 

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:09.520
 need to be any thickness 

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:12.910
 as well as the upper strand which is now 

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:16.020
 We have a free situation 

00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:16.020
 this pigtail
