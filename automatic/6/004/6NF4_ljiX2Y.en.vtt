perforations<00:00:20.220> in<00:00:20.550> their<00:00:20.699> shoes<00:00:20.970> because<00:00:21.720> when

00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:22.100 
perforations in their shoes because when

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:24.080 
perforations in their shoes because when
they<00:00:23.100> would<00:00:23.189> be<00:00:23.310> walking<00:00:23.640> in<00:00:23.730> the<00:00:23.789> country

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:24.090 
they would be walking in the country

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:25.790 
they would be walking in the country
it'd<00:00:24.180> be<00:00:24.269> moist<00:00:24.539> or<00:00:24.810> wet<00:00:24.840> and<00:00:25.470> it<00:00:25.560> would<00:00:25.680> help

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:25.800 
it'd be moist or wet and it would help

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:27.740 
it'd be moist or wet and it would help
the<00:00:26.010> water<00:00:26.189> drain<00:00:26.760> out<00:00:26.910> of<00:00:26.939> their<00:00:27.180> shoe<00:00:27.420> so<00:00:27.720> it

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:27.750 
the water drain out of their shoe so it

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:30.169 
the water drain out of their shoe so it
wouldn't<00:00:28.140> be<00:00:28.289> soaking<00:00:29.099> in<00:00:29.250> there<00:00:29.460> and<00:00:29.670> staying

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:30.179 
wouldn't be soaking in there and staying

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:32.120 
wouldn't be soaking in there and staying
in<00:00:30.359> the<00:00:30.449> chute<00:00:30.689> constantly<00:00:31.289> and<00:00:31.500> basically

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:32.130 
in the chute constantly and basically

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:34.549 
in the chute constantly and basically
all<00:00:32.420> broguing<00:00:33.420> is<00:00:33.660> is<00:00:33.960> these<00:00:34.410> little

Brogan is today however it's used

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:49.970 
Brogan is today however it's used
strictly<00:00:47.340> for<00:00:47.550> design<00:00:48.539> exactly<00:00:49.469> right<00:00:49.710> I<00:00:49.860> mean

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:49.980 
strictly for design exactly right I mean

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:51.410 
strictly for design exactly right I mean
yeah<00:00:50.129> exactly<00:00:50.340> it<00:00:50.730> doesn't<00:00:50.969> have<00:00:51.059> anything<00:00:51.270> to

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
yeah exactly it doesn't have anything to

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:53.630 
yeah exactly it doesn't have anything to
do<00:00:51.629> with<00:00:51.660> really<00:00:52.590> I<00:00:52.829> mean<00:00:53.129> it<00:00:53.340> does<00:00:53.489> happen

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
Brogan in the front which means it is

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:15.800 
Brogan in the front which means it is

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:23.430 
not on the front it's only along the cap

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:27.380 
not on the front it's only along the cap
and<00:01:24.080> towards<00:01:25.080> the<00:01:25.200> back<00:01:25.380> of<00:01:25.409> the<00:01:25.590> shoe<00:01:26.390> the

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
and towards the back of the shoe the

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:30.230 
and towards the back of the shoe the
next<00:01:27.630> one<00:01:27.780> is<00:01:27.960> the<00:01:28.080> semi<00:01:28.320> broke<00:01:28.740> and<00:01:28.979> the<00:01:29.700> semi

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
next one is the semi broke and the semi

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:31.730 
next one is the semi broke and the semi
broke<00:01:30.450> does<00:01:30.720> have<00:01:30.930> the<00:01:31.049> brownie<00:01:31.350> on<00:01:31.470> the<00:01:31.560> toe

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
broke does have the brownie on the toe

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:34.370 
broke does have the brownie on the toe
but<00:01:32.310> it<00:01:32.400> only<00:01:32.640> has<00:01:33.000> it<00:01:33.210> along<00:01:33.509> the<00:01:33.810> cap<00:01:34.049> of<00:01:34.290> the

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 
but it only has it along the cap of the

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:36.620 
but it only has it along the cap of the
toe<00:01:34.799> as<00:01:35.009> well<00:01:35.040> not<00:01:35.549> closer<00:01:36.210> to<00:01:36.390> the<00:01:36.450> back<00:01:36.600> I

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
toe as well not closer to the back I

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:38.600 
toe as well not closer to the back I
mean<00:01:36.869> this<00:01:36.990> one<00:01:37.170> goes<00:01:37.320> a<00:01:37.350> little<00:01:37.500> far<00:01:37.770> back<00:01:37.979> but

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610 
mean this one goes a little far back but

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:40.670 
mean this one goes a little far back but
it<00:01:38.729> is<00:01:38.909> still<00:01:39.210> the<00:01:39.360> cap<00:01:39.600> of<00:01:39.810> the<00:01:39.960> toe<00:01:40.140> because

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.680 
it is still the cap of the toe because

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:43.100 
it is still the cap of the toe because
you<00:01:41.009> can<00:01:41.400> see<00:01:41.520> that<00:01:41.670> it's<00:01:42.390> been<00:01:42.570> broke<00:01:42.869> the

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110 
you can see that it's been broke the

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:44.780 
you can see that it's been broke the
scientist<00:01:43.530> working<00:01:43.740> his<00:01:43.920> way<00:01:43.950> up<00:01:44.070> right

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:44.790

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:51.109 
throughout issue so I'm going to do a
little<00:01:49.619> compare<00:01:50.159> and<00:01:50.250> contrast<00:01:50.369> you<00:01:50.790> see

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:51.119 
little compare and contrast you see

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:53.840 
little compare and contrast you see
right<00:01:51.689> if<00:01:51.869> this<00:01:52.049> if<00:01:52.290> this<00:01:52.409> had<00:01:52.680> the<00:01:53.250> toe<00:01:53.399> broken

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:53.850 
right if this if this had the toe broken

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:55.899 
right if this if this had the toe broken
this<00:01:54.060> would<00:01:54.210> be<00:01:54.360> a<00:01:54.630> semi<00:01:55.110> broke<00:01:55.320> as<00:01:55.470> well

00:01:55.899 --> 00:01:55.909 
this would be a semi broke as well

00:01:55.909 --> 00:01:59.810 
this would be a semi broke as well
exactly<00:01:56.909> and<00:01:57.409> the<00:01:58.409> full<00:01:58.710> broke<00:01:58.920> full<00:01:59.549> brogue

00:01:59.810 --> 00:01:59.820 
exactly and the full broke full brogue

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:03.830 
exactly and the full broke full brogue
is<00:02:00.090> a<00:02:01.219> brownie<00:02:02.219> pretty<00:02:02.579> much<00:02:02.759> everywhere<00:02:03.719> on

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:03.840 
is a brownie pretty much everywhere on

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:05.780 
is a brownie pretty much everywhere on
the<00:02:03.930> shoe<00:02:04.140> that's<00:02:04.290> on<00:02:04.439> the<00:02:04.619> toe<00:02:05.250> it's<00:02:05.520> on<00:02:05.670> the

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:05.790 
the shoe that's on the toe it's on the
