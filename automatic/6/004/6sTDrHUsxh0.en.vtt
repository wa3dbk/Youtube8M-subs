00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:44.440 
so it's actually kind of you know from

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:45.870 
so it's actually kind of you know from
an<00:03:44.530> engineering<00:03:44.890> perspective<00:03:45.100> I<00:03:45.550> would<00:03:45.610> argue

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:45.880 
an engineering perspective I would argue

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:47.520 
an engineering perspective I would argue
that<00:03:46.060> this<00:03:46.300> one<00:03:46.510> kind<00:03:46.690> of<00:03:46.750> creates<00:03:47.440> a<00:03:47.500> little

00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:47.530 
that this one kind of creates a little

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:49.680 
that this one kind of creates a little
bit<00:03:47.770> more<00:03:47.950> of<00:03:48.010> an<00:03:48.130> airfoil<00:03:48.550> effect<00:03:49.000> so<00:03:49.450> it<00:03:49.540> kind

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:49.690 
bit more of an airfoil effect so it kind

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:51.120 
bit more of an airfoil effect so it kind
of<00:03:49.720> catches<00:03:49.930> that<00:03:50.230> wind<00:03:50.410> and<00:03:50.560> pushes<00:03:50.860> it<00:03:51.010> up

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:51.130 
of catches that wind and pushes it up

00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:53.430 
of catches that wind and pushes it up
and<00:03:51.310> out<00:03:51.459> as<00:03:51.670> opposed<00:03:52.000> you<00:03:52.660> know<00:03:52.780> up<00:03:53.080> and<00:03:53.290> out

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:53.440 
and out as opposed you know up and out

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:54.900 
and out as opposed you know up and out
the<00:03:53.620> side<00:03:53.830> as<00:03:54.010> opposed<00:03:54.310> to<00:03:54.430> hitting<00:03:54.820> the

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:14.650 
to the other two like I said basically

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:16.409 
to the other two like I said basically
got<00:04:15.070> three<00:04:15.100> windshields<00:04:15.850> from<00:04:16.030> three<00:04:16.269> great

00:04:16.409 --> 00:04:16.419

probably<00:04:21.519> more<00:04:21.910> variety<00:04:22.390> than<00:04:22.419> we<00:04:22.630> really

00:04:22.890 --> 00:04:22.900 
probably more variety than we really

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:24.510 
probably more variety than we really
need<00:04:23.050> to<00:04:23.200> have<00:04:23.320> it<00:04:23.590> probably<00:04:23.919> just<00:04:24.130> kind<00:04:24.430> of

00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:24.520

can't<00:04:38.120> really<00:04:38.360> go<00:04:38.449> wrong<00:04:38.479> with<00:04:38.779> any<00:04:39.139> of<00:04:39.169> them<00:04:39.349> I

00:04:39.519 --> 00:04:39.529 
can't really go wrong with any of them I

00:04:39.529 --> 00:04:41.860 
can't really go wrong with any of them I
wouldn't<00:04:39.860> be<00:04:39.979> surprised<00:04:40.669> if<00:04:40.939> going<00:04:41.300> forward

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:41.870 
wouldn't be surprised if going forward

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:44.709 
wouldn't be surprised if going forward
well<00:04:42.259> we<00:04:42.529> didn't<00:04:42.860> drop<00:04:43.069> like<00:04:43.400> at<00:04:44.210> least<00:04:44.419> one<00:04:44.599> of

00:04:44.709 --> 00:04:44.719 
well we didn't drop like at least one of

00:04:44.719 --> 00:04:45.850 
well we didn't drop like at least one of
them<00:04:44.779> and<00:04:44.990> just<00:04:45.110> kind<00:04:45.289> of<00:04:45.319> had<00:04:45.469> you<00:04:45.740> know

00:04:45.850 --> 00:04:45.860 
them and just kind of had you know

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:47.499 
them and just kind of had you know
options<00:04:46.039> a<00:04:46.370> and<00:04:46.400> B<00:04:46.639> instead<00:04:46.879> of<00:04:46.999> options<00:04:47.389> a<00:04:47.479> B

00:04:50.379 --> 00:04:50.389 
and C but those are the three options

we've<00:04:51.349> got<00:04:51.680> installed<00:04:52.490> on<00:04:52.669> a<00:04:52.699> bv<00:04:53.150> 350<00:04:53.719> on<00:04:54.020> my

00:04:54.219 --> 00:04:54.229 
we've got installed on a bv 350 on my

00:04:54.229 --> 00:04:56.950 
we've got installed on a bv 350 on my
right<00:04:54.499> here<00:04:54.830> we've<00:04:55.610> actually<00:04:55.849> got<00:04:56.270> the<00:04:56.300> Biondi

00:04:56.950 --> 00:04:56.960 
right here we've actually got the Biondi

00:04:56.960 --> 00:04:58.719 
right here we've actually got the Biondi
windshield<00:04:57.349> installed<00:04:57.740> so<00:04:57.889> the<00:04:57.919> B<00:04:58.099> on<00:04:58.219> d1<00:04:58.430> was

00:04:58.719 --> 00:04:58.729 
windshield installed so the B on d1 was

00:04:58.729 --> 00:05:01.330 
windshield installed so the B on d1 was
the<00:04:58.849> first<00:04:59.060> one<00:04:59.240> that<00:04:59.270> we<00:04:59.449> installed<00:05:00.340> you'll

00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:01.340 
the first one that we installed you'll

00:05:01.340 --> 00:05:04.420 
the first one that we installed you'll
see<00:05:01.610> the<00:05:02.150> gradiated<00:05:02.659> bottom<00:05:03.259> really<00:05:04.069> kind<00:05:04.370> of

00:05:04.420 --> 00:05:04.430 
see the gradiated bottom really kind of

00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:05.950 
see the gradiated bottom really kind of
hides<00:05:04.729> some<00:05:04.999> of<00:05:05.029> the<00:05:05.180> hardware<00:05:05.449> some<00:05:05.810> of<00:05:05.900> the

hides some of the hardware some of the
unsightly<00:05:06.289> hardware's<00:05:06.800> it<00:05:07.009> kind<00:05:07.189> of

00:05:07.239 --> 00:05:07.249 
unsightly hardware's it kind of

00:05:07.249 --> 00:05:09.550 
unsightly hardware's it kind of
telescopes<00:05:07.729> into<00:05:07.939> the<00:05:08.089> handlebars<00:05:08.539> and<00:05:08.779> these

00:05:09.550 --> 00:05:09.560 
telescopes into the handlebars and these

00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:11.800 
telescopes into the handlebars and these
actually<00:05:10.189> installed<00:05:10.819> just<00:05:10.999> like<00:05:11.270> all<00:05:11.509> the

00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:11.810 
actually installed just like all the

00:05:11.810 --> 00:05:13.689 
actually installed just like all the
other<00:05:11.960> rest<00:05:12.229> was<00:05:12.409> in<00:05:12.560> piaggio<00:05:13.069> x'<00:05:13.099> there's<00:05:13.610> a

00:05:13.689 --> 00:05:13.699 
other rest was in piaggio x' there's a

00:05:13.699 --> 00:05:15.760 
other rest was in piaggio x' there's a
female<00:05:14.029> cylinder<00:05:14.779> built<00:05:15.409> into<00:05:15.680> the

00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:22.510 
male expansion fitting of the windshield
hardware<00:05:20.449> telescopes<00:05:21.169> into<00:05:21.349> that<00:05:21.560> expands

00:05:22.510 --> 00:05:22.520 
hardware telescopes into that expands

00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:24.010 
hardware telescopes into that expands
and<00:05:22.639> voila<00:05:22.969> you've<00:05:23.210> got<00:05:23.240> the<00:05:23.509> thing<00:05:23.689> held<00:05:23.870> in

00:05:24.010 --> 00:05:24.020 
and voila you've got the thing held in

00:05:24.020 --> 00:05:26.019 
and voila you've got the thing held in
place<00:05:24.259> I<00:05:24.499> must<00:05:25.279> say<00:05:25.460> installing<00:05:25.939> these
