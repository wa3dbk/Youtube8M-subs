00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:04.670 
ever day on the first ever part I

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:09.139 
ever day on the first ever part I
literally<00:02:05.670> spooned<00:02:06.180> around<00:02:07.020> here<00:02:07.970> like<00:02:08.970> if

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:09.149 
literally spooned around here like if

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:10.430 
literally spooned around here like if
you<00:02:09.209> can<00:02:09.330> look<00:02:09.420> at<00:02:09.509> my<00:02:09.599> compass<00:02:10.020> is<00:02:10.140> actually

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:10.440 
you can look at my compass is actually

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:12.440 
you can look at my compass is actually
pointed<00:02:10.950> to<00:02:11.099> where<00:02:11.250> it<00:02:11.370> is

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:12.450 
pointed to where it is

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:15.199 
pointed to where it is
so<00:02:13.260> if<00:02:13.349> I<00:02:13.410> said<00:02:13.590> in<00:02:13.680> my<00:02:13.709> spot<00:02:14.129> look<00:02:14.760> it's<00:02:14.970> simply

00:02:15.199 --> 00:02:15.209 
so if I said in my spot look it's simply

00:02:15.209 --> 00:02:16.610 
so if I said in my spot look it's simply
rise<00:02:15.360> for<00:02:15.510> hire<00:02:15.660> me<00:02:15.810> when<00:02:16.080> I<00:02:16.170> move<00:02:16.349> back<00:02:16.590> a

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:16.620 
rise for hire me when I move back a

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:19.970 
rise for hire me when I move back a
point<00:02:17.190> to<00:02:17.250> be<00:02:17.280> forward<00:02:18.650> so<00:02:19.650> I'd<00:02:19.739> say<00:02:19.890> it's

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:19.980 
point to be forward so I'd say it's

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:22.009 
point to be forward so I'd say it's
pretty<00:02:20.099> epic<00:02:20.360> it's<00:02:21.360> really<00:02:21.540> good<00:02:21.629> if<00:02:21.840> you<00:02:21.900> get

00:02:22.009 --> 00:02:22.019 
pretty epic it's really good if you get

00:02:22.019 --> 00:02:24.740 
pretty epic it's really good if you get
lost<00:02:22.200> I'll<00:02:22.650> tell<00:02:22.890> you<00:02:22.920> that<00:02:23.390> well<00:02:24.390> soon<00:02:24.569> as<00:02:24.660> we

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:24.750 
lost I'll tell you that well soon as we

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:27.440 
lost I'll tell you that well soon as we
don't<00:02:24.870> really<00:02:25.050> need<00:02:25.260> that<00:02:25.319> right<00:02:25.680> now<00:02:26.450> module

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:27.450 
don't really need that right now module

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:29.330 
don't really need that right now module
I<00:02:27.660> like<00:02:27.959> having<00:02:28.410> the<00:02:28.470> compass<00:02:28.739> there<00:02:28.890> so<00:02:29.069> I<00:02:29.220> can

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:29.340 
I like having the compass there so I can

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:31.610 
I like having the compass there so I can
actually<00:02:29.730> tell<00:02:29.910> which<00:02:30.060> way<00:02:30.239> to<00:02:30.300> which<00:02:30.620> like

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:31.620 
actually tell which way to which like

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:35.330 
actually tell which way to which like
from<00:02:31.860> my<00:02:32.010> spawn<00:02:32.340> point<00:02:32.640> or<00:02:32.790> away<00:02:33.980> so<00:02:34.980> that's<00:02:35.190> my

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:35.340 
from my spawn point or away so that's my

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:37.430 
from my spawn point or away so that's my
