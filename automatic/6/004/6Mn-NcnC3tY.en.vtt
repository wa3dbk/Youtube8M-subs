 In this video I 'm going to teach you 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:15.509
 how to change the language of your book of 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:19.260
 legends to switch to English 

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:21.000
 if it's good now here I left for 

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:23.130
 Portuguese but I can change the 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:26.039
 region here put north america 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:27.990
 English, save and go quietly. 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:31.349
 for English but for you to do 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:32.550
 It's very simple, come on, you 're going to 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:35.850
 your computer 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:40.350
 c2 points later will invade games 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:42.059
 league of legends heads sistan and looking for 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:44.070
 here by block this path goes in 

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:47.450
 description there by chance someone loses 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:50.700
 something you open this lock with 

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:52.739
 11 with the notepad and will be 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:55.710
 subscribed en how I just changed 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:58.050
 Now English is written in Beverly. 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:01:02.550
 hills but you're going to be en-br then 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:04.199
 you put on walking there and the anecy neci 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:05.549
 en br or leave my subscription 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:08.939
 right 

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:11.520
 there's like you write there, but you save 

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:14.460
 there phase what you have to do in 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:18.180
 20 properties and tag the attribute 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:20.729
 read only because before 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:22.770
 prevents you from updating it 

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:24.659
 I returned Portuguese because if I did not have 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:27.570
 marked when you have to authorize 

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:30.450
 Going back Portuguese remembering that 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:33.000
 After you do that, you'll soon update 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:34.229
 will update the 300 megs heavyweight 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.930
 Why do you have to lower all the lines? 

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:39.390
 English the client gets everything in English and 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:42.000
 I think it's very interesting, this is me. 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:44.070
 English because it changes all the voiceovers 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:46.740
 seems to be playing against the character 

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:49.409
 if you see those of the original neighborhood combines 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:51.030
 but this makes us very good is good 

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:54.630
 everyone there at least give a try 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:57.479
 of the bar a life there but then 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:02:03.869
 after it's done this will update 

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:07.200
 annually English and Portuguese places 

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:10.289
 brazil portuguese saves being a little bit 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:12.569
 and it's going to come back Portuguese but then this 

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:13.740
 video fast video just press to 

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:16.080

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:18.510
 possible to leave the film in English too 

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:20.910
 It's very good to leave him, but not even that. 

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:23.490
 I hope you enjoyed it if you liked it. 

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:24.450
 a favorite link and to divulge 

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:26.450
 but that's it 

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:36.120
 Thank you for the follow up so far. 

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:38.670
 said that it is good that you researched a friend of 

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:45.030
 One way out of a way 

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:47.520
 thing that one learns the cruise and 

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:49.940
 could google and find a solution and not 

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:49.940
 simply
