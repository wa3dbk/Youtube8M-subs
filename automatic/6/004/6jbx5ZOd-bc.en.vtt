00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.950
 So I told her, I won’t pay for your abortion. 

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:03.950
 We can take the money to the amusement park. 

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.950
 Hey, hey, how are you? Just didn’t notice you. 

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
 The first film of the week was a clip from the TLC Travel Life Channel. 

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.940
 The couple, they insisted on the first kiss after marriage. 

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:20.090
 I declare that you have become a husband and now you can kiss the bride. 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:29.940
 Well, if your first kiss will make your dad cover up, you should know where it is wrong. 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.950
 This film has seen 1.5 million people in just a few days. 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.950
 I just mentioned that this is a movie from the TLC channel. The name of the program is "Diary of Diary". 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:37.950
 I don't know where they are going and shoot this virgin virgin. 

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.950
 Anyway, TLC will have some weird shows, but if this is their first kiss, 

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:42.950
 I really can't imagine how they want to round the room. 

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.950
 Or does the virgin world have their own "counter system"? 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:49.950
 The first base is the Eskimo-style kissing (with the nose rubbing each other) 

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.950
 The second base is a butterfly-style kiss (close-up blinking eyelashes contact the skin) third base is married 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.950
 Then this strange terrorist act is the home base. 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.950
 Then why are they getting married? Is it for kissing or for sex? 

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.950
 After all, you know that once a person has married, he will stop. 

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.950
 The next video is called "My Subway Experience" 

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:11.550
 You probably have already seen it because this film has seen 8 million people in the past few days. 

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:13.950
 Actually, I am not sure if I should comment on this film because the woman in this film... 

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:15.950
 The degree of racism is incredible 

00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:19.300
 The whole car is black, and there are a bunch of Poles from him!! 

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:27.360
 You are not British!! Do you dare to say that you are British?? I am!! Give me a shut up, your black talent is not British! 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:29.950
 God, where should I start? 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.950
 How about talking about a child from her knee? 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.950
 Although I am sorry, this lady’s behavior is really evil. 

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.950
 How evil is it? 

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.950
 If I want to say something, she is more evil than the suicide bomber with a machete. 

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.900
 It is also evil than Freddy, who joined the Nazis who are still working at the Vehicle Authority (US Supervisory Unit) (Freddy, "The Midnight Ghosts" series of horror movie protagonists) 

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:54.540
 It’s also evil than the one that Mariah Carey took at the VMA Music Awards. 

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:56.950
 This video is really unpleasant 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:58.950
 So I want to say if I can make it interesting. 

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.900
 For example, if you match the music of the circus 

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:07.950
 Ok, this doesn't make it interesting if you add some fat clowns? 

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:13.940
 Oh, still can't do that if you add canned laughter 

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.000
 To play a situational comedy? 

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.050
 I think even Larry David (comedian, screenwriter, producer) can't make this movie interesting. 

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.940
 Now the last paragraph is about a deer film. 

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:30.080
 This deer has obviously not been well trained in sexual harassment prevention. 

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:36.290
 Oh my god! I have a shot here. 

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:39.510
 It is going to start on you!! 

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:41.950
 He is like the behavior of all the men in the world after drinking a few cans of beer. 

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:43.940
 And my most uncomfortable place 

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.440
 It’s this deer that has stolen my signature action. 

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:48.950
 "Oh, it doesn't matter, it won't be like it~" 

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:52.510
 Oh, then I really like this guy who is filming, especially this part. 

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:57.100
 This deer has been chasing you, yeah, hahahaha 

00:02:57.170 --> 00:03:03.000
 This is really good, hahaha is really embarrassing. 

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:03.130
 Wow, that deer is really super-poor, right? Is this really good? Hahaha is really embarrassing. 

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:05.540
 Wow, that deer is really super poor, right? 

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:09.510
 It’s like a horror movie, especially when it’s close to the car, it feels like it’s 

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:11.670
 It’s gone, we’re going to flash 

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.940
 Although it may have caused some harassment to her, I think it is basically a good deer. 

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.940
 So let's imagine it together. 

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.940
 If they really go out on a date together 

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:26.000
 What will happen? 

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:30.160
 What is your father doing? Hey, my dad is a hunter. 

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:34.010
 Waiter, come for venison, thank you for telling the truth? 

00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:37.820
 Honestly, madam, I am really fascinated by you. 

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:40.040
 Well, I am very happy to be with you. 

00:03:40.070 --> 00:03:42.880
 Oh, but you are still slow, he is just a deer. 

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:49.000
 What do you say? I bet, if they come to a first kiss, they will still be more uncomfortable than this. 

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:53.940
 But do you know that there is nothing too super? 

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.090
 Today's problem is raised by the audience, he said... 

00:04:06.350 --> 00:04:09.130
 Tell me what is your record? 

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:15.940
 Oh, this is really cool. "What is your filing?" 

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:16.940

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:26.940
 Hey, hurry, I haven’t left yet. 

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:28.940
 Tell you, I opened a new animation channel with some guys. 

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:30.940
 Call it "AniMonster", go check it out. 

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:32.940
 There are many different cartoon shows inside. 

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:34.940

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:37.940
 See you in a few days. 

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:40.940
 Tell me now, what are you looking at? 

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:42.940
 (I don't want to be a virgin) 

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:45.690
 Is that the eyelashes on Ray's face? 

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:49.280
 An old comedian who talks about some old jokes. 

00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:53.940
 Then every time he finishes, he will "These are the jokes of this time, I..." 

00:04:55.440 --> 00:05:00.620
 More evil than a spider! She is even more evil than a gay Republican! 

00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:01.940
 More evil than obese purple criminals 

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:04.940
 Evil than Ann Culter (lawyer, columnist) 

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:07.940
 Evil than Westboro (extreme anti-gay church) evil than Peter... 

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:11.000
 I like it! Ah, really like 

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:20.000
