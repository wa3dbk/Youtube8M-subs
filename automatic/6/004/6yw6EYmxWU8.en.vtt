00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:17.910 
with my 3-way SLI set up and had a

and<00:00:23.369> so<00:00:23.490> I<00:00:23.519> decided<00:00:23.880> to<00:00:24.000> try<00:00:24.779> one<00:00:25.019> myself<00:00:25.230> and

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:25.769 
and so I decided to try one myself and

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:28.460 
and so I decided to try one myself and
I've<00:00:26.519> been<00:00:26.670> extremely<00:00:27.240> happy<00:00:27.689> with<00:00:27.720> it<00:00:28.019> so<00:00:28.050> far

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:33.650 
so I thought I'd show you a little bit
about<00:00:30.679> what<00:00:31.679> it<00:00:31.800> looks<00:00:31.980> like<00:00:32.099> today<00:00:32.430> so<00:00:33.120> this

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:33.660 
about what it looks like today so this

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:36.049 
about what it looks like today so this
is<00:00:33.690> the<00:00:33.809> system<00:00:34.230> from<00:00:34.350> the<00:00:34.530> sign<00:00:34.770> here<00:00:35.070> and<00:00:35.760> you

is the system from the sign here and you

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:37.940 
is the system from the sign here and you
can<00:00:36.149> see<00:00:36.420> it's<00:00:36.809> ridiculous<00:00:37.440> in<00:00:37.590> terms<00:00:37.620> of

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:37.950 
can see it's ridiculous in terms of

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:42.230 
just temporary that's going to change

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530 
looks so I've got the sleeving kits and

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:14.840 
looks so I've got the sleeving kits and
whatnot<00:02:13.830> so<00:02:13.860> I<00:02:14.040> have<00:02:14.130> a<00:02:14.160> lot<00:02:14.310> of<00:02:14.340> work<00:02:14.550> to<00:02:14.730> do

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:14.850 
whatnot so I have a lot of work to do

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:16.520 
whatnot so I have a lot of work to do
yet<00:02:15.090> but<00:02:15.390> I<00:02:15.420> just<00:02:15.480> couldn't<00:02:15.750> resist<00:02:15.990> them<00:02:16.380> you

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:16.530 
yet but I just couldn't resist them you

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:18.920 
yet but I just couldn't resist them you
know<00:02:16.680> just<00:02:17.430> plan<00:02:18.060> on<00:02:18.090> sleeping<00:02:18.450> all<00:02:18.750> those

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:18.930 
know just plan on sleeping all those

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:23.240 
know just plan on sleeping all those
power<00:02:19.290> cables<00:02:19.830> and<00:02:19.980> whatnot<00:02:21.050> my<00:02:22.050> buddy<00:02:22.380> one<00:02:23.160> of

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:23.250 
power cables and whatnot my buddy one of

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:26.900 
power cables and whatnot my buddy one of
my<00:02:23.310> buddies<00:02:23.430> built<00:02:23.850> a<00:02:25.400> water-cooled<00:02:26.400> set<00:02:26.760> up

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:26.910 
my buddies built a water-cooled set up

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:29.660 
my buddies built a water-cooled set up
on<00:02:27.120> what<00:02:27.930> danger<00:02:28.350> den<00:02:28.530> cooling<00:02:28.980> and<00:02:29.130> such<00:02:29.340> and

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:29.670 
on what danger den cooling and such and

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:32.630 
on what danger den cooling and such and
I<00:02:30.330> got<00:02:30.780> the<00:02:30.960> I<00:02:31.290> think<00:02:32.220> it's<00:02:32.340> called<00:02:32.490> the

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:32.640 
I got the I think it's called the

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:34.100 
I got the I think it's called the
Ascension<00:02:33.240> and<00:02:33.390> that<00:02:33.570> thing<00:02:33.780> is<00:02:33.810> just

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:34.110 
Ascension and that thing is just

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:36.650 
Ascension and that thing is just
ridiculous<00:02:34.800> in<00:02:35.520> terms<00:02:35.580> of<00:02:35.910> size<00:02:36.150> it<00:02:36.420> stands

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:36.660 
ridiculous in terms of size it stands

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:38.800 
ridiculous in terms of size it stands
about<00:02:36.900> six<00:02:37.230> inches<00:02:37.410> higher<00:02:37.710> than<00:02:37.740> this<00:02:38.100> does

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:38.810 
about six inches higher than this does

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:43.010 
about six inches higher than this does
so<00:02:40.430> we<00:02:41.430> can<00:02:41.700> show<00:02:42.150> you<00:02:42.180> what<00:02:42.360> it<00:02:42.450> looks<00:02:42.480> like<00:02:42.780> on

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:43.020 
so we can show you what it looks like on

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:46.070 
so we can show you what it looks like on
the<00:02:43.080> inside<00:02:43.730> so<00:02:44.730> you<00:02:44.760> can<00:02:44.940> see<00:02:45.360> pardon<00:02:45.990> the

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:46.080 
the inside so you can see pardon the

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:49.840 
the inside so you can see pardon the
mess<00:02:46.230> of<00:02:46.440> wires<00:02:46.700> but<00:02:47.700> plenty<00:02:48.540> of<00:02:48.570> room<00:02:49.320> for

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:49.850 
mess of wires but plenty of room for

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:52.820 
mess of wires but plenty of room for
radiators<00:02:50.850> and<00:02:50.880> whatnot<00:02:51.360> and<00:02:51.660> in<00:02:52.500> there<00:02:52.710> right

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:52.830 
radiators and whatnot and in there right

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:55.730 
radiators and whatnot and in there right
now<00:02:53.010> is<00:02:53.160> just<00:02:53.190> my<00:02:53.520> little<00:02:54.330> hyper<00:02:54.780> 212<00:02:55.080> plus

00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:55.740 
now is just my little hyper 212 plus

00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:59.180 
now is just my little hyper 212 plus
that's<00:02:56.700> been<00:02:57.060> serving<00:02:57.360> me<00:02:57.630> just<00:02:57.870> fine<00:02:58.050> so<00:02:58.830> I'll

00:02:59.180 --> 00:02:59.190 
that's been serving me just fine so I'll

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:01.310 
that's been serving me just fine so I'll
go<00:02:59.280> ahead<00:02:59.310> and<00:02:59.430> turn<00:02:59.610> it<00:02:59.760> on<00:02:59.880> here<00:03:00.090> these<00:03:01.020> are

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:01.320 
go ahead and turn it on here these are

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:03.980 
go ahead and turn it on here these are
great<00:03:01.710> just<00:03:02.160> these<00:03:02.640> are<00:03:02.850> nickel<00:03:03.300> plated<00:03:03.900> or

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:03.990 
great just these are nickel plated or

00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:06.290 
great just these are nickel plated or
they<00:03:04.740> may<00:03:04.890> be<00:03:04.950> solid<00:03:05.400> nickel<00:03:05.700> but<00:03:05.880> very<00:03:06.210> very

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:06.300 
they may be solid nickel but very very

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:13.700 
they may be solid nickel but very very
high<00:03:06.750> quality<00:03:07.340> switches<00:03:08.340> and<00:03:08.630> there<00:03:09.630> we<00:03:09.750> go

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:13.710 

00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:18.860 

so<00:03:14.580> the<00:03:15.150> the<00:03:16.020> air<00:03:16.200> flow<00:03:16.590> across<00:03:16.920> the<00:03:17.870> three

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:18.870 
so the the air flow across the three

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:23.150 
so the the air flow across the three
cards<00:03:19.440> is<00:03:20.030> just<00:03:21.030> tremendous<00:03:21.360> so<00:03:22.230> it<00:03:22.950> does<00:03:23.130> a

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:23.160 
cards is just tremendous so it does a

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:27.080 
cards is just tremendous so it does a
good<00:03:23.340> job<00:03:23.400> keeping<00:03:23.730> those<00:03:24.000> cool<00:03:24.360> and<00:03:25.820> so<00:03:26.820> far

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:27.090 
good job keeping those cool and so far

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:29.600 
good job keeping those cool and so far
I've<00:03:27.240> just<00:03:27.510> been<00:03:28.050> even<00:03:28.800> impressed<00:03:29.310> with<00:03:29.460> the

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:29.610 
I've just been even impressed with the

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:32.450 
I've just been even impressed with the
noise<00:03:30.270> level<00:03:30.770> judging<00:03:31.770> by<00:03:31.800> but<00:03:32.190> you<00:03:32.280> know<00:03:32.340> the

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:32.460 
noise level judging by but you know the

00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:34.070 
noise level judging by but you know the
number<00:03:32.700> of<00:03:32.820> 120<00:03:33.360> s<00:03:33.450> that<00:03:33.540> I<00:03:33.630> have<00:03:33.750> in<00:03:33.900> there

00:03:34.070 --> 00:03:34.080 
number of 120 s that I have in there

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:37.160 
number of 120 s that I have in there
it's<00:03:34.230> it's<00:03:34.590> still<00:03:34.980> fairly<00:03:35.160> quiet<00:03:35.690> so<00:03:36.690> anyway

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:37.170 
it's it's still fairly quiet so anyway

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:39.200 
it's it's still fairly quiet so anyway
so<00:03:37.230> that's<00:03:37.500> it<00:03:37.770> let's<00:03:38.310> get<00:03:38.670> a<00:03:38.700> better<00:03:38.880> shot<00:03:38.970> of

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:39.210 
so that's it let's get a better shot of

00:03:39.210 --> 00:03:43.940 
so that's it let's get a better shot of
the<00:03:39.330> front<00:03:39.630> here<00:03:42.080> and<00:03:43.080> I<00:03:43.230> still<00:03:43.770> haven't

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:43.950 
the front here and I still haven't

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:45.650 
the front here and I still haven't
unpacked<00:03:44.220> everything<00:03:44.670> there<00:03:45.180> so<00:03:45.390> eventually

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:45.660 
unpacked everything there so eventually

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:48.200 
unpacked everything there so eventually
there'll<00:03:45.960> be<00:03:45.990> a<00:03:46.110> bay<00:03:46.350> here<00:03:46.710> but<00:03:47.700> that's<00:03:47.850> it<00:03:48.030> i

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:48.210 
there'll be a bay here but that's it i

00:03:48.210 --> 00:03:50.150 
there'll be a bay here but that's it i
hope<00:03:48.780> you<00:03:49.020> guys<00:03:49.170> find<00:03:49.350> this<00:03:49.500> video
