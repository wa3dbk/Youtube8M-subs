00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:23.420
 hi today we are talking about a 

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:27.830
 basic maneuver 

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:30.439
 August octurn rollerblade rollerblading or top 

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:31.820
 turn means a high wave turn he 

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:33.650
 There is a multitude of maneuvers 

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:35.300
 high waves with appellations all 

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:37.220
 as important as confusing next 

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:39.230
 the surfer's origin his culture his 

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:40.790
 generation but all lines 

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:41.230
 the action of going to perform a turn in 

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:43.610
 high wave 

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:46.580
 this maneuver is necessarily 

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:48.440
 following a bottom turn to achieve 

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:50.090
 this maneuver the ideal situation and 

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:52.129
 to face the wave finally of 

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:53.839
 bottom once to the two waves the 

00:00:52.129 --> 00:00:55.670
 surfers bent should pretty quickly 

00:00:53.839 --> 00:00:57.650
 pointing the top of his body down 

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:59.059
 of the wave the upper body and motors 

00:00:57.650 --> 00:01:01.760
 and above all anticipates the future 

00:00:59.059 --> 00:01:04.040
 trajectory the gaze then the hands the 

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:05.540
 pelvis and finally the whole body feet 

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:08.070
 curl up successively to make a 

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:10.470
 more or less tight turn 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:12.270
 in high wave the back foot grows 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:13.800
 on the drift triangle while 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:16.909
 the front leg is trying to bring back the 

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:16.909
 middle of the board under the shoulders 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:21.930
 the surfer can chain a new 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:23.850
 descent into the wave and comes to relay 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:24.990
 this action by rapidly increasing the 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:27.119
 weight on the front of his board 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:28.710
 the roller seems more difficult to 

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:31.320
 execute in frontside position that 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:33.000
 backside indeed in backside position 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:34.380
 the surfer will naturally have the 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.539
 possibility of choosing a trajectory 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:37.560
 vertical by letting go back up his 

00:01:36.539 --> 00:01:39.600
 board up the wave 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:41.310
 being back also allows 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:42.840
 to accentuate the thrust on the foot 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:44.750
 back and thus make the maneuver 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:46.910
 more radical 

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:47.960
 whatever the stealth the output 

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:49.490
 a roller from a place to a new 

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:50.870
 descent into the wave to chain 

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:52.470
 a new maneuver and continue his 

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:54.660
 project on the wave 

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:56.760
 in summary at the exit of your bottom 

00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:58.770
 goes up against the wave in the climb 

00:01:56.760 --> 00:02:00.900
 your hands and upper body anticipates 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:02.550
 the turn brings the board back under 

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:03.750
 feet and tilts the point in the 

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:07.040
 descent to chain with another 

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:09.450
 nice tom now to you to play 

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:11.970
 takes into account those who are in the water 

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:12.730
 with you take advantage of his advice and my 

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:28.230
 surf
