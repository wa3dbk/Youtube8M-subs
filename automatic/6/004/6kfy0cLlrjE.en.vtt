00:00:01.759 --> 00:00:04.630
 Also, you are thinking of resorting to a 

00:00:04.630 --> 00:00:08.590
 not the foot borrowed by the inter enter of buying the house itself and 

00:00:08.590 --> 00:00:12.869
 pension in the federal economic box think it is easier are smaller 

00:00:12.869 --> 00:00:17.079
 Is it really that Paul is the step-by-step for you to get money in 

00:00:17.079 --> 00:00:19.650
 Federal savings bank to buy your own home 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:23.090
 and it's missing for us it's marcelo silver that left the car three 

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:26.580
 also spent the whole morning before anything else writes to people who are hot 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:27.619
 crash nation 

00:00:27.619 --> 00:00:31.470
 to the text an online tool that helps people who want to acquire the house 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:34.770
 itself via real estate financing finds the best rates 

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:38.730
 and that at no additional cost to Brazil by another guy who is buying real estate 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:40.050
 crafts 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:43.270
 I hope that we can move to your country. 

00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:46.680
 financing in the federal savings bank the purchase of the home 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:51.880
 the selection process begins with credit analysis does not have how the bank look 

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:55.070
 for this process but also without arrears payment of the 

00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:55.940
 buyer 

00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:59.760
 so the first step is to look for a box agency that is close to 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:02.030
 region where there were Texan buyers 

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:05.330
 and there seek the information with the bank manager that he will provide 

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:09.560
 what are the chief colire lines then in case the cashier always looks for agency 

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:13.510
 For example, the subject has an income from the dino family. 

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:16.710
 5 million initial orders 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:20.130
 have to be consistent with the family's income, this is exactly what the 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:23.640
 banks make the federal savings bank one of them is to make available on the internet 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:24.969
 a simulator 

00:01:24.969 --> 00:01:28.590
 then the customer can already have a concept but at least 40 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:31.950
 needed for the amount of funding that he needs 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:36.180
 the home owners are actually smaller than in the other past retail bank 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:40.080
 there has to be a bit of myth that exists in the market nécaras like mica they 

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:42.830
 always been a great bank. 

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:44.770
 is a homeowner 

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:48.310
 but this has been changing drastically in recent years and today all the great 

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:51.570
 retail banks have a keen pro-kremlin appetite we have an idea more 

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:52.260
 pointed out 

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:55.780
 banks charge interest to anyone who asks for financing to buy house 

00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:57.110
 own 

00:01:57.110 --> 00:02:01.200
 I have to do with the specialist. 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:04.340
 I can say the following have mobile teams up to 150 thousand 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:08.560
 is to go to those who earn up to six minimum wages the box will have conditions 

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:12.410
 even offering a lower rate because those with funding 

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:16.170
 it means where the resource comes from in the exchange is said it is cheaper than the fgts 

00:02:16.829 --> 00:02:21.430
 so we're talking about rates can be 6 to 7 a half percent 

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:26.420
 to Holland the year if and when we talk about the scenes and 150 thousand there 

00:02:26.419 --> 00:02:28.220
 all sides are very similar 

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:32.319
 we're talking about rates ranging from eight and a half to 11 percent 

00:02:32.319 --> 00:02:34.569
 always attached the value of the property 

00:02:34.569 --> 00:02:38.239
 also a year a year understands and has to have law must have 

00:02:38.239 --> 00:02:40.120
 coherence with family income 

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:44.840
 The rule that banks use is that the person can commit up to 30% of the 

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:47.840
 income from the first installment of the 

00:02:48.479 --> 00:02:52.439
 then this is the rule takes the real estate loan which phase the emma thing but 

00:02:52.439 --> 00:02:56.359
 faster in the case of the economic box I could get money to finance 

00:02:56.359 --> 00:02:57.849
 a car and motivation 

00:02:57.849 --> 00:03:01.990
 was married has a credit distribution policy that is by 

00:03:01.989 --> 00:03:03.389
 superintendencies 

00:03:03.389 --> 00:03:07.029
 then each region has its superintendencies means that it will 

00:03:07.029 --> 00:03:09.199
 take care of that process is born 

00:03:09.199 --> 00:03:12.459
 so have a dash of luck in that front debut 

00:03:12.459 --> 00:03:16.369
 We have cases in Brazil here today so the athlete had Brazil all over 

00:03:16.369 --> 00:03:18.839
 So we talk to customers everywhere. 

00:03:18.839 --> 00:03:22.609
 and there are ten processes that are very agile in the south of the country, for example 

00:03:22.609 --> 00:03:26.689
 process that took a few months and 11 7 million then the same bank 

00:03:26.689 --> 00:03:28.430
 even if it came even product 

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:32.500
 other possibility of handing over the money depends on the 

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:37.030
 superintendence of the one that is a high region of processes in the 

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:40.380
 with very large volumes and then you never know if you're going 

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:44.350
 that process and will be the first in the queue where I am unfortunately 

00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:49.130
 characteristics were basic documents that are required on a case by case basis. 

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:51.739
 ask for home financing 

00:03:51.739 --> 00:03:55.139
 The first step is that the income part does not have much secrecy that the 

00:03:55.139 --> 00:03:57.769
 personal documents and proof of income 

00:03:57.769 --> 00:04:00.769
 which has changed a lot in recent years 

00:04:12.239 --> 00:04:15.369
 then someone who standalone for example and can present the last three 

00:04:15.369 --> 00:04:19.879
 bank statements that the bank will understand that if the real income per capita 

00:04:19.879 --> 00:04:20.569
 there is nothing 

00:04:20.569 --> 00:04:25.159
 the impact has a minutest minimum if the idea of ​​how much the box lends to the 

00:04:25.159 --> 00:04:26.480
 maximum goes as far as 

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:30.720
 it is minimum water it practically does not exist today that we would make 20 thousand 

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:33.289
 real is not the least 

00:04:33.289 --> 00:04:36.819
 helium it also it does not require that it will depend 

00:04:37.509 --> 00:04:41.930
 I asked rape for these values ​​have what kind of resource the customer is 

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:42.909
 ceasing 

00:04:42.909 --> 00:04:45.909
 so let's say it's ceased it wants to eg use fgts 

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:48.220
 as part of payment 

00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:52.430
 he will be able to buy real estate up to 500 thousand reais only but above that he will 

00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:55.560
 able to buy will have access to sfac credit and will be able to use the 

00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:57.930
 guarantee and comes with a tram in the box that is loosening up 

00:04:57.930 --> 00:05:00.460
 a closet with a sônia home mouth 

00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:04.500
 You can lose your balance in the guarantee fund. 

00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:08.060
 once you can not miss a bit of myth also the best of all 

00:05:08.060 --> 00:05:11.509
 large commercial banks are authorized by the central bank and the 

00:05:11.509 --> 00:05:13.449
 fat and fgts curator council 

00:05:13.449 --> 00:05:18.289
 to make the bottom of the bar the retired was carried out by europa 

00:05:18.289 --> 00:05:22.319
 then it is a myth that is in the market according to the house if the manager of the children 

00:05:22.319 --> 00:05:23.360
 pf 

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:26.810
 but today anyone can do prayer action is very serious because he is the 

00:05:26.810 --> 00:05:29.340
 room in my training conversation thank you 

00:05:29.340 --> 00:05:33.070
 delegate you also want to buy more 65 and maicon way you need to learn one 

00:05:33.070 --> 00:05:37.910
 little more like asking for financing for your own house by the economic box 

00:05:37.910 --> 00:05:38.850
 federal is lousy
