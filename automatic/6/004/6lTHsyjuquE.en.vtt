the red tube coming from the turbo down
here<00:00:58.089> and<00:00:59.089> our<00:00:59.239> modules<00:00:59.689> just<00:00:59.899> underneath

00:01:00.130 --> 00:01:00.140 
here and our modules just underneath

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:02.200 
here and our modules just underneath
this<00:01:00.350> bracket<00:01:00.739> right<00:01:00.890> here<00:01:00.949> so<00:01:01.699> if<00:01:01.789> we<00:01:01.879> look<00:01:02.059> up

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:02.210 
this bracket right here so if we look up

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:06.850 
this bracket right here so if we look up
close<00:01:02.619> they're<00:01:04.689> four<00:01:05.740> bolts<00:01:06.740> that<00:01:06.770> are

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:06.860 
close they're four bolts that are

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:09.010 
close they're four bolts that are
holding<00:01:06.950> it<00:01:07.250> in<00:01:07.310> place<00:01:07.429> with<00:01:08.119> a<00:01:08.149> reverse<00:01:08.600> Torx

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:09.020 
holding it in place with a reverse Torx

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:13.359 
holding it in place with a reverse Torx
head<00:01:09.110> so<00:01:10.100> we<00:01:10.340> go<00:01:10.490> one<00:01:11.090> here<00:01:11.479> one<00:01:12.049> here<00:01:12.100> and<00:01:13.100> then

00:01:13.359 --> 00:01:13.369 
head so we go one here one here and then

00:01:13.369 --> 00:01:14.680 
head so we go one here one here and then
to<00:01:13.549> here<00:01:13.850> so<00:01:14.000> we're<00:01:14.119> going<00:01:14.240> to<00:01:14.299> go<00:01:14.390> ahead<00:01:14.509> and

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:14.690 
to here so we're going to go ahead and

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:20.410 
to here so we're going to go ahead and
remove<00:01:14.960> all<00:01:15.140> those<00:01:15.289> bolts<00:01:19.030> nice<00:01:20.030> we<00:01:20.240> have<00:01:20.330> the

00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:20.420

set<00:01:30.280> aside<00:01:30.750> now<00:01:31.750> a<00:01:31.780> module<00:01:32.320> should<00:01:32.500> come<00:01:32.710> right

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:32.830 
set aside now a module should come right

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:39.990 
set aside now a module should come right
out<00:01:32.980> of<00:01:33.010> here<00:01:38.340> here's<00:01:39.340> our<00:01:39.430> log<00:01:39.670> squeeze

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:40.000
