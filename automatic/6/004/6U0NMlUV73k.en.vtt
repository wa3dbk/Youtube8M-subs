 let's model our work from what 

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:29.610
 we will need to start the first to find it 

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:34.290
 these communities as we search for them 

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:35.070
 see let's say we choose headphones 

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:40.200

 a person in a group 

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:15.890
 that is, we go down to the bottom and look for 

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:19.730
 groups with the smallest number 

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:23.030
 participants that is got off enough 

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:26.840
 just just scroll to the bottom 

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:31.160

00:06:52.700 --> 00:07:04.910
 understandable that is find a group see 

00:07:01.780 --> 00:07:06.350

00:07:04.910 --> 00:07:09.560
 her goods 

00:07:06.350 --> 00:07:12.800
 reviews that is because it happens 

00:07:09.560 --> 00:07:16.640
 you open groups and just stand here 

00:07:12.800 --> 00:07:19.430
 picture 10 participants and here is just 

00:07:16.640 --> 00:07:22.910
 everything is empty now go to the next 

00:07:19.430 --> 00:07:25.970
