know<00:01:43.740> it's<00:01:43.860> kind<00:01:44.010> of<00:01:44.040> like<00:01:44.159> a<00:01:44.220> copper<00:01:44.549> tone<00:01:44.760> to

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:44.909 
know it's kind of like a copper tone to

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:46.280 
know it's kind of like a copper tone to
silver<00:01:45.270> right<00:01:45.420> over<00:01:45.659> here<00:01:45.869> at<00:01:45.960> the<00:01:46.020> very<00:01:46.170> end

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290 
silver right over here at the very end

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:47.510 
silver right over here at the very end
which<00:01:46.770> I<00:01:46.830> think<00:01:46.979> it's<00:01:47.100> a<00:01:47.130> very<00:01:47.220> cool-looking

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
which I think it's a very cool-looking

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:49.429 
which I think it's a very cool-looking
choice<00:01:47.970> I<00:01:48.210> like<00:01:48.390> it<00:01:48.570> then<00:01:48.990> the<00:01:49.110> rest<00:01:49.140> of<00:01:49.350> this

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:49.439 
choice I like it then the rest of this

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:50.840 
choice I like it then the rest of this
is<00:01:49.590> sculpted<00:01:49.920> out<00:01:50.010> pretty<00:01:50.280> well<00:01:50.369> it's<00:01:50.670> just<00:01:50.700> a

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:50.850 
is sculpted out pretty well it's just a

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:52.550 
is sculpted out pretty well it's just a
solid<00:01:51.000> brown<00:01:51.330> piece<00:01:51.540> of<00:01:51.689> plastic<00:01:52.170> but<00:01:52.320> you<00:01:52.409> get

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560 
solid brown piece of plastic but you get

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:54.020 
solid brown piece of plastic but you get
these<00:01:52.740> lines<00:01:53.010> sculpted<00:01:53.460> in<00:01:53.580> here<00:01:53.729> making<00:01:53.970> it

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
these lines sculpted in here making it

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:55.399 
these lines sculpted in here making it
look<00:01:54.150> like<00:01:54.299> it's<00:01:54.450> actual<00:01:54.780> wood<00:01:55.020> now<00:01:55.260> you're

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:55.409 
look like it's actual wood now you're

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:56.870 
look like it's actual wood now you're
looking<00:01:55.530> at<00:01:55.770> the<00:01:55.860> head<00:01:56.040> sculpt<00:01:56.430> and<00:01:56.549> I<00:01:56.610> think

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:56.880 
looking at the head sculpt and I think

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:59.690 
looking at the head sculpt and I think
it<00:01:57.000> came<00:01:57.180> out<00:01:57.360> fantastic<00:01:57.600> I<00:01:58.380> love<00:01:58.770> it<00:01:58.920> is<00:01:59.130> just

00:01:59.690 --> 00:01:59.700 
it came out fantastic I love it is just

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:01.460 
it came out fantastic I love it is just
dead<00:01:59.939> on<00:01:59.970> Kraven<00:02:00.689> and<00:02:00.810> I<00:02:00.930> think<00:02:01.110> it<00:02:01.200> looks

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:01.470 
dead on Kraven and I think it looks

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:03.020 
dead on Kraven and I think it looks
great<00:02:01.799> now<00:02:02.070> one<00:02:02.220> thing<00:02:02.369> I<00:02:02.490> think<00:02:02.700> people<00:02:02.729> were

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:03.030 
great now one thing I think people were

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:04.399 
great now one thing I think people were
concerned<00:02:03.450> about<00:02:03.570> is<00:02:03.810> if<00:02:03.840> they're<00:02:04.049> gonna<00:02:04.170> use

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:04.409 
concerned about is if they're gonna use

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:06.350 
concerned about is if they're gonna use
the<00:02:04.590> Doctor<00:02:05.070> Strange<00:02:05.130> figure<00:02:05.790> head<00:02:05.970> sculpt

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:06.360 
the Doctor Strange figure head sculpt

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:08.359 
the Doctor Strange figure head sculpt
you<00:02:06.450> know<00:02:06.570> to<00:02:06.630> redo<00:02:07.110> it<00:02:07.140> for<00:02:07.259> this<00:02:07.560> Craven<00:02:07.979> but

00:02:08.359 --> 00:02:08.369 
you know to redo it for this Craven but

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:09.800 
you know to redo it for this Craven but
no<00:02:08.519> they<00:02:08.729> haven't<00:02:08.940> as<00:02:09.209> you<00:02:09.299> can<00:02:09.450> see<00:02:09.630> they're

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:09.810 
no they haven't as you can see they're

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:11.420 
no they haven't as you can see they're
totally<00:02:10.259> different<00:02:10.560> head<00:02:10.679> sculpts<00:02:11.130> right

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:11.430 
totally different head sculpts right

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:13.130 
totally different head sculpts right
yeah<00:02:11.850> they<00:02:12.120> have<00:02:12.239> similar<00:02:12.540> features<00:02:12.870> but

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:13.140 
yeah they have similar features but

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:14.750 
yeah they have similar features but
they're<00:02:13.290> totally<00:02:13.709> different<00:02:13.860> and<00:02:14.519> I<00:02:14.580> think

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:14.760 
they're totally different and I think

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:16.370 
they're totally different and I think
the<00:02:14.820> flesh<00:02:15.060> tone<00:02:15.269> looks<00:02:15.450> really<00:02:15.810> good<00:02:15.959> on<00:02:16.019> this

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:16.380 
the flesh tone looks really good on this

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:17.960 
the flesh tone looks really good on this
I<00:02:16.530> like<00:02:16.890> how<00:02:16.950> the<00:02:17.010> paint<00:02:17.310> came<00:02:17.489> out<00:02:17.670> for<00:02:17.880> the

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:17.970 
I like how the paint came out for the

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:19.699 
I like how the paint came out for the
most<00:02:18.150> part<00:02:18.480> I<00:02:18.660> think<00:02:18.780> that<00:02:19.019> left<00:02:19.290> eye<00:02:19.500> is<00:02:19.560> just

00:02:19.699 --> 00:02:19.709 
most part I think that left eye is just

00:02:19.709 --> 00:02:21.860 
most part I think that left eye is just
slightly<00:02:20.519> to<00:02:20.850> the<00:02:20.880> left<00:02:21.090> but<00:02:21.480> only<00:02:21.660> a<00:02:21.780> very

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:21.870 
slightly to the left but only a very

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:23.900 
slightly to the left but only a very
little<00:02:22.380> bit<00:02:22.680> so<00:02:22.950> it's<00:02:23.160> not<00:02:23.310> too<00:02:23.549> bad<00:02:23.730> it

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:23.910 
little bit so it's not too bad it

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:25.640 
little bit so it's not too bad it
doesn't<00:02:24.060> really<00:02:24.269> bother<00:02:24.450> me<00:02:24.720> at<00:02:24.810> all<00:02:24.930> looking

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:25.650 
doesn't really bother me at all looking

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:27.199 
doesn't really bother me at all looking
on<00:02:25.739> the<00:02:25.829> side<00:02:25.980> over<00:02:26.160> here<00:02:26.250> the<00:02:26.579> hair<00:02:26.730> sculpted

00:02:27.199 --> 00:02:27.209 
on the side over here the hair sculpted

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:29.210 
on the side over here the hair sculpted
nicely<00:02:27.600> and<00:02:27.750> painted<00:02:28.049> very<00:02:28.170> well<00:02:28.500> I<00:02:28.680> like<00:02:29.130> how

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:29.220 
nicely and painted very well I like how

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:30.620 
nicely and painted very well I like how
they<00:02:29.340> even<00:02:29.550> got<00:02:29.670> that<00:02:29.790> cowlick<00:02:30.150> right<00:02:30.420> over

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:30.630 
they even got that cowlick right over

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:32.180 
they even got that cowlick right over
there<00:02:30.780> so<00:02:30.989> very<00:02:31.170> nice<00:02:31.319> attention<00:02:31.620> to<00:02:31.800> detail

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:32.190 
there so very nice attention to detail

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:33.710 
there so very nice attention to detail
on<00:02:32.220> the<00:02:32.430> head<00:02:32.610> sculpt<00:02:33.000> and<00:02:33.150> looking<00:02:33.360> at<00:02:33.450> the

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:33.720 
on the head sculpt and looking at the

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:35.390 
on the head sculpt and looking at the
to<00:02:33.810> the<00:02:33.900> figure<00:02:34.170> they<00:02:34.380> did<00:02:34.620> reuse<00:02:34.980> the<00:02:35.160> Grim

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:35.400 
to the figure they did reuse the Grim

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:37.040 
to the figure they did reuse the Grim
Reaper<00:02:35.730> body<00:02:36.030> mold<00:02:36.360> which<00:02:36.600> I<00:02:36.720> think<00:02:36.930> was<00:02:37.020> a

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:37.050 
Reaper body mold which I think was a

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:38.750 
Reaper body mold which I think was a
great<00:02:37.440> move<00:02:37.710> and<00:02:37.950> I<00:02:38.070> think<00:02:38.100> it<00:02:38.340> really<00:02:38.520> works

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:38.760 
great move and I think it really works

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:40.280 
great move and I think it really works

is still a great figure I remember when

00:06:02.729 --> 00:06:03.950 
is still a great figure I remember when
I<00:06:02.789> first<00:06:02.969> picked<00:06:03.210> this<00:06:03.389> up<00:06:03.599> I<00:06:03.750> was<00:06:03.899> thinking

00:06:03.950 --> 00:06:03.960 
I first picked this up I was thinking

00:06:03.960 --> 00:06:05.869 
I first picked this up I was thinking
like<00:06:04.319> oh<00:06:04.439> man<00:06:04.620> why<00:06:05.159> can't<00:06:05.399> we<00:06:05.460> get<00:06:05.610> one<00:06:05.729> like

00:06:05.869 --> 00:06:05.879 
like oh man why can't we get one like

00:06:05.879 --> 00:06:07.369 
like oh man why can't we get one like
that<00:06:05.909> from<00:06:06.210> Laurel<00:06:06.479> legends<00:06:06.899> and<00:06:07.110> now<00:06:07.319> we

00:06:07.369 --> 00:06:07.379 
that from Laurel legends and now we

00:06:07.379 --> 00:06:09.320 
that from Laurel legends and now we
finally<00:06:07.740> have<00:06:08.159> it<00:06:08.399> then<00:06:08.669> here's<00:06:08.849> Craven<00:06:09.180> next

00:06:09.320 --> 00:06:09.330 
finally have it then here's Craven next

00:06:09.330 --> 00:06:10.790 
finally have it then here's Craven next
to<00:06:09.389> the<00:06:09.449> Marvel<00:06:09.659> Legends<00:06:09.899> chameleon<00:06:10.379> figure

00:06:10.790 --> 00:06:10.800 
to the Marvel Legends chameleon figure

00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:12.019 
to the Marvel Legends chameleon figure
now<00:06:11.159> let's<00:06:11.310> see<00:06:11.399> if<00:06:11.460> we<00:06:11.520> can<00:06:11.610> get<00:06:11.699> some<00:06:11.849> head

00:06:12.019 --> 00:06:12.029 
now let's see if we can get some head

00:06:12.029 --> 00:06:13.909 
now let's see if we can get some head
swapping<00:06:12.449> action<00:06:12.779> going<00:06:13.020> on<00:06:13.080> over<00:06:13.139> here<00:06:13.560> huh<00:06:13.710> I

00:06:13.909 --> 00:06:13.919 
swapping action going on over here huh I

00:06:13.919 --> 00:06:15.439 
swapping action going on over here huh I
wonder<00:06:14.069> if<00:06:14.189> this<00:06:14.310> is<00:06:14.399> gonna<00:06:14.490> fit<00:06:14.759> probably<00:06:15.300> not

00:06:15.439 --> 00:06:15.449 
wonder if this is gonna fit probably not

00:06:15.449 --> 00:06:16.820 
wonder if this is gonna fit probably not
because<00:06:15.750> the<00:06:15.839> Craven<00:06:16.139> figure<00:06:16.379> is<00:06:16.439> so<00:06:16.649> much

00:06:16.820 --> 00:06:16.830 
because the Craven figure is so much

00:06:16.830 --> 00:06:19.700 
because the Craven figure is so much
larger<00:06:17.069> and<00:06:17.839> it<00:06:18.839> actually<00:06:18.990> pops<00:06:19.379> on<00:06:19.560> there

00:06:19.700 --> 00:06:19.710 
larger and it actually pops on there

00:06:19.710 --> 00:06:22.309 
larger and it actually pops on there
very<00:06:20.039> nicely<00:06:20.339> but<00:06:21.180> it<00:06:21.360> does<00:06:21.629> look<00:06:21.930> a<00:06:22.050> little

00:06:22.309 --> 00:06:22.319 
very nicely but it does look a little

00:06:22.319 --> 00:06:26.209 
very nicely but it does look a little
big<00:06:23.810> and<00:06:24.810> then<00:06:25.110> here's<00:06:25.319> Kraven<00:06:25.800> the<00:06:25.830> hunter
