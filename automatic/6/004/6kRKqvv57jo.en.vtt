 display that should appear soon 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:24.449
 and we'll deal with it that way today 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:27.449
 called satellites and I have you 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:30.230
 say in advance these monsters are very very 

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:32.969
 strong just too the exits are very 

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:35.880
 apart from my opinion so catch 

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:38.670
 we just do that with those 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:40.680
 principle is only once these knights 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:42.809
 quite simply if you summon them then 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:44.969
 you can activate an effect 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:48.600
 and the effect of that all 

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:51.300
 just you can do a twitter entirely 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:54.420
 just add your hand from the deck 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:58.370
 and this effect only once a time 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:01:02.609
 activate turn then we have here 

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:04.019
 Carla and illness can be following 

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:07.650
 activate effect 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:09.720
 You can be a knight from your deck 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:13.950
 the cemetery are of course that too 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:17.729
 only once per turn then here the 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:20.479
 old the following can her a can 

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:23.100
 plate knight monster in the cemetery like 

00:01:20.479 --> 00:01:25.590
 then in the open 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:26.970
 summon defensive position and 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:31.710
 if 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:34.080
 this will effect enabled may for 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:36.950
 the rest of the game no other monster 

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:39.540
 except to attack these valleys knights 

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:41.730
 and of course very good because of that 

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:44.150
 opponents aufgeschmissen plays his 

00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:47.640
 also with tuyer then we have here 

00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:50.400
 Sirius He has the following effect 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:53.070
 five valleys knights from the cemetery 

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:54.480
 you can choose and all five of them instead 

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:56.820
 then a card can be rhythmic 

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:58.890
 can draw accordingly is very 

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:02.310
 very good because you have a lot of cards 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:04.550
 Again index plus power and the whole 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:08.160
 can use effects here again 

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:10.590
 In addition, deer also very handy 

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:12.420
 because you can the opponent if this straight 

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:15.510
 Just summon up 1000 like that 

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:20.160
 inflicting harm is so very strong 

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:22.080
 windy as well here proxy quite simply 

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:25.709
 if this card is summoned then 

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:28.260
 you can call a 1 tele knight monster of 

00:02:25.709 --> 00:02:30.120
 lay the hand in the cemetery and 

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:32.910
 if you do that, you can draw a card 

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:35.640
 So make another one plus and one 

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:38.220
 you just get more valleys knight on 

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:41.370
 the cemetery just here, too 

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:43.800
 Serious effect to activate and all the 

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:45.090
 to recover vega is too 

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:48.630
 very special 

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:53.070
 you can be a third monster of 

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:55.110
 the hand special numm yes then yes too 

00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:57.630
 quicker to summon an exit 

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:59.280
 So this card is very strong 

00:02:57.630 --> 00:03:01.500
 actually the strongest because you are so 

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:04.769
 just can get very fast exit 

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:09.030
 then here i have the sign of satire 

00:03:04.769 --> 00:03:10.920
 knights simply you can make a topic 

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:13.459
 knight monster what you control 

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:17.640
 Choose and have a theme knight monster 

00:03:13.459 --> 00:03:20.459
 Special Summon from your deck 

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:24.360
 conjure up another name 

00:03:20.459 --> 00:03:27.570
 Selected target then wants 16 back and 

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:30.810
 so long as this game special 

00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:33.300
 weighted monster is on the field 

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:35.310
 can give you can not themselves 

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:37.620
 other monsters except many knights as 

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:39.270
 is summon special incantation 

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:41.940
 namely very convenient because you are here 

00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:44.340
 can choose which theme knight 

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:46.489
 monster in the cemetery 

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:49.319
 wants to get the field 

00:03:46.489 --> 00:03:52.140
 next we have the influence here 

00:03:49.319 --> 00:03:54.900
 the stele knight too that is very very 

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:56.819
 good because you can equip a monster 

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:59.220
 that receives 500 attika and the windows 

00:03:56.819 --> 00:04:01.830
 in addition and besides, it stays off 

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:04.350
 effects that are unaffected 

00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:06.360
 is very very good only disadvantage 

00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:08.370
 if you do not become a topic of the 

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:10.860
 monster then controls this 

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:13.310
 map destroyed and the last fall 

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:17.130
 Map is simply the English one 

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:19.079
 once per turn during the dyna 

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:21.000
 thinks face chamber next to the begged 

00:04:19.079 --> 00:04:23.610
 or in the battle face just the opposite 

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:24.600
 that unites all knights by the hand 

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:27.330
 weaken a few times 

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:30.270
 that's really nice because it poses 

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:32.210
 you sometimes sets before her have this card 

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:34.100
 then one 

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:36.699
 Shaan, for example, is weakened and 

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:39.259
 then you can still here in the final phase 

00:04:36.699 --> 00:04:41.060
 The enemy may not come across it 

00:04:39.259 --> 00:04:43.039
 by chance or you have that 

00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:45.110
 do not come over their seats 

00:04:43.039 --> 00:04:50.479
 here in the Licher, you have three 

00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:52.970
 just that easily a yes satire on knight 

00:04:50.479 --> 00:04:55.639
 the world and now, of course, come the 

00:04:52.970 --> 00:05:02.500
 You can not talk about any of them here 

00:04:55.639 --> 00:05:07.789
 both the details or 

00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:09.470
 terrors and or the trevi call something 

00:05:07.789 --> 00:05:11.780
 can trivia she needs first 

00:05:09.470 --> 00:05:13.509
 three valleys knights monster of level four 

00:05:11.780 --> 00:05:17.660
 okay that would be given 

00:05:13.509 --> 00:05:20.300
 and you can pull this in the game 

00:05:17.660 --> 00:05:22.039
 This card has not been activated 

00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:23.720
 Special summon except 

00:05:22.039 --> 00:05:27.169
 camouflaged by tena is so very very 

00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:29.210
 good and if this card as exit 

00:05:27.169 --> 00:05:30.860
 Summon sworn would give all 

00:05:29.210 --> 00:05:32.479
 other cards on the field on the 

00:05:30.860 --> 00:05:34.630
 hand back that is the playing field that 

00:05:32.479 --> 00:05:37.970
 completely empty yes free course 

00:05:34.630 --> 00:05:40.220
 you can already do a lot with 2100 at 

00:05:37.970 --> 00:05:41.840
 can do it and play once per game 

00:05:40.220 --> 00:05:44.000
 you agree material monster of 

00:05:41.840 --> 00:05:46.729
 depend on this card and one at random 

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:49.159
 card from the hand of the opponent on the 

00:05:46.729 --> 00:05:51.409
 Laying cemetery is so very nice 

00:05:49.159 --> 00:05:53.330
 and if this card in the cemetery 

00:05:51.409 --> 00:05:55.639
 it is laid to say that looks material 

00:05:53.330 --> 00:05:57.380
 monster has a plate knight 

00:05:55.639 --> 00:05:59.449
 Monsters in the cemetery choose this one 

00:05:57.380 --> 00:06:03.889
 then weaken so we have three here 

00:05:59.449 --> 00:06:05.570
 super cool effects and as I said that 

00:06:03.889 --> 00:06:08.840
 the field completely empty if you the 

00:06:05.570 --> 00:06:12.650
 then we have here again date 

00:06:08.840 --> 00:06:17.630
 eros easily when there applies the 

00:06:12.650 --> 00:06:20.000
 same could be yes if this too 

00:06:17.630 --> 00:06:22.400
 exten material monster resp 

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:25.400
 as long as this card material has monster 

00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:27.199
 The opponent can not have a card or effects 

00:06:25.400 --> 00:06:29.449
 Enable if you monster as normal 

00:06:27.199 --> 00:06:31.849
 or special summons complains that 

00:06:29.449 --> 00:06:34.280
 So it's really hot because you 

00:06:31.849 --> 00:06:36.860
 You can say so to the opponent 

00:06:34.280 --> 00:06:39.349
 all trains check chess if you like that 

00:06:36.860 --> 00:06:41.479
 wants to lock and once per turn 

00:06:39.349 --> 00:06:43.370
 one can just agree that one sees in it 

00:06:41.479 --> 00:06:44.409
 monster depend on this map and 

00:06:43.370 --> 00:06:46.569
 then one 

00:06:44.409 --> 00:06:48.909
 select the card on the field and that 

00:06:46.569 --> 00:06:50.979
 once to destroy the goal 

00:06:48.909 --> 00:06:52.869
 and if this card from the field on 

00:06:50.979 --> 00:06:55.389
 You can give it to the cemetery 

00:06:52.869 --> 00:06:57.129
 your theme knight monster as against 

00:06:55.389 --> 00:06:59.289
 Special provision of your hand or 

00:06:57.129 --> 00:07:01.179
 the deck complaints so that's right 

00:06:59.289 --> 00:07:03.399
 hot because then you have the here again 

00:07:01.179 --> 00:07:05.769
 It is possible, for example, here so 

00:07:03.399 --> 00:07:08.439
 to bring in the peace vega and then 

00:07:05.769 --> 00:07:11.199
 you very quickly to another 

00:07:08.439 --> 00:07:13.389

00:07:11.199 --> 00:07:14.919
 i hope that in small informations 

00:07:13.389 --> 00:07:16.779
 I liked it video I wanted it 

00:07:14.919 --> 00:07:18.610
 a little bit shorter is me now 

00:07:16.779 --> 00:07:20.379
 maybe not really successful 

00:07:18.610 --> 00:07:22.689
 In any case, the comments 

00:07:20.379 --> 00:07:26.969
