00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:07.560 
obviously I'm doing deadlifts once a

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:08.960 
obviously I'm doing deadlifts once a
week<00:02:07.680> and<00:02:07.860> sandwich<00:02:08.340> in<00:02:08.520> between<00:02:08.789> my<00:02:08.910> two

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:08.970 
week and sandwich in between my two

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:11.630 
week and sandwich in between my two
squats<00:02:09.360> or<00:02:09.509> so<00:02:09.869> a<00:02:10.080> lot<00:02:11.009> of<00:02:11.039> the<00:02:11.129> time<00:02:11.280> I<00:02:11.310> tend<00:02:11.580> to

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:11.640

squats or so a lot of the time I tend to
be<00:02:11.760> quite<00:02:11.910> tired<00:02:12.239> a<00:02:12.360> little<00:02:12.450> bit<00:02:12.629> fatigued

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:13.100 
be quite tired a little bit fatigued

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:14.590 
be quite tired a little bit fatigued
so<00:02:13.340> like<00:02:13.550> I<00:02:13.580> said<00:02:13.700> with<00:02:13.850> this<00:02:13.970> fire<00:02:14.120> buff<00:02:14.330> I<00:02:14.420> was

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:14.600 
so like I said with this fire buff I was

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:16.120 
so like I said with this fire buff I was
just<00:02:14.720> the<00:02:14.870> case<00:02:15.020> of<00:02:15.200> getting<00:02:15.500> done<00:02:15.710> really<00:02:16.010> and

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:16.130 
just the case of getting done really and

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:17.620 
just the case of getting done really and
the<00:02:16.190> fact<00:02:16.400> that<00:02:16.460> I<00:02:16.580> can<00:02:16.730> continue<00:02:16.970> to<00:02:17.390> put<00:02:17.540> the

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:17.630 
the fact that I can continue to put the

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:20.440 
the fact that I can continue to put the
way<00:02:17.750> up<00:02:17.960> and<00:02:18.140> I'm<00:02:19.040> hitting<00:02:19.250> kind<00:02:19.640> of<00:02:19.790> pr's<00:02:20.090> week

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:20.450 
way up and I'm hitting kind of pr's week

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:22.090 
way up and I'm hitting kind of pr's week
on<00:02:20.630> week<00:02:20.810> four<00:02:21.140> reps<00:02:21.380> and<00:02:21.530> sets<00:02:21.680> is<00:02:21.830> obviously

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:22.100 
on week four reps and sets is obviously

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:24.190 
on week four reps and sets is obviously
very<00:02:22.160> pleasing<00:02:22.790> but<00:02:23.690> the<00:02:23.750> biggest<00:02:23.960> thing<00:02:24.080> for

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:24.200 
very pleasing but the biggest thing for

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:25.540 
very pleasing but the biggest thing for
me<00:02:24.320> is<00:02:24.380> just<00:02:24.470> getting<00:02:24.800> that<00:02:24.950> working<00:02:25.370> as<00:02:25.460> I

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:25.550 
me is just getting that working as I

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:26.920 
me is just getting that working as I
know<00:02:25.610> that<00:02:25.880> when<00:02:26.000> I<00:02:26.030> fresh<00:02:26.390> when<00:02:26.600> I'm<00:02:26.690> fresh

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:26.930 
know that when I fresh when I'm fresh

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:29.680 
know that when I fresh when I'm fresh
when<00:02:27.080> I<00:02:27.140> see<00:02:27.320> load<00:02:27.530> I've<00:02:28.460> got<00:02:28.730> PRS<00:02:29.090> to<00:02:29.210> come<00:02:29.390> and

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:29.690 
when I see load I've got PRS to come and

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:31.630 
when I see load I've got PRS to come and
here's<00:02:30.380> the<00:02:30.560> fifth<00:02:30.770> think<00:02:30.980> this<00:02:31.100> was<00:02:31.280> a<00:02:31.310> pretty

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:31.640 
here's the fifth think this was a pretty

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:34.540 
here's the fifth think this was a pretty
big<00:02:32.180> grind<00:02:32.510> it<00:02:32.690> was<00:02:32.810> fairly<00:02:33.050> ugly<00:02:33.290> but<00:02:34.130> turns

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:34.550 
big grind it was fairly ugly but turns

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:36.130 
big grind it was fairly ugly but turns
it's<00:02:34.670> not<00:02:34.760> bad<00:02:35.000> feeling<00:02:35.300> quite<00:02:35.480> like<00:02:35.690> grinding

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:36.140 
it's not bad feeling quite like grinding

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:38.020 
it's not bad feeling quite like grinding
a<00:02:36.230> trips<00:02:36.470> because<00:02:36.740> obviously<00:02:37.490> when<00:02:37.730> it<00:02:37.850> comes

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:38.030 
a trips because obviously when it comes

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:40.330 
a trips because obviously when it comes
to<00:02:38.180> a<00:02:38.210> PR<00:02:38.510> like<00:02:39.110> a<00:02:39.140> big<00:02:39.410> PR<00:02:39.620> I'm<00:02:39.800> gonna<00:02:39.980> have<00:02:40.190> to

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:40.340 
to a PR like a big PR I'm gonna have to

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:41.740 
to a PR like a big PR I'm gonna have to
grind<00:02:40.490> it<00:02:40.640> out<00:02:40.700> so<00:02:40.880> I<00:02:40.940> think<00:02:41.030> it's<00:02:41.300> good<00:02:41.510> to<00:02:41.540> get

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:41.750 
grind it out so I think it's good to get

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:43.540 
grind it out so I think it's good to get
used<00:02:41.930> to<00:02:42.020> that<00:02:42.110> obviously<00:02:42.440> you<00:02:42.740> don't<00:02:43.430> be

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:43.550 
used to that obviously you don't be

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:44.740 
used to that obviously you don't be
doing<00:02:43.700> all<00:02:43.850> the<00:02:43.940> time<00:02:44.090> because<00:02:44.330> then<00:02:44.600> you're

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:44.750 
doing all the time because then you're

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:47.140 
doing all the time because then you're
going<00:02:45.020> to<00:02:45.170> die<00:02:45.710> but<00:02:46.010> to<00:02:46.550> do<00:02:46.670> it<00:02:46.700> sometimes

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:47.150 
going to die but to do it sometimes

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:48.760 
going to die but to do it sometimes
obviously<00:02:47.600> it's<00:02:47.750> good<00:02:47.990> experience<00:02:48.320> and<00:02:48.680> that

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:48.770 
obviously it's good experience and that

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:51.490 
obviously it's good experience and that
my<00:02:48.980> friends<00:02:49.280> my<00:02:49.430> 565<00:02:50.120> going<00:02:50.870> down<00:02:51.050> it<00:02:51.200> sucks

deficits<00:03:14.330> it's<00:03:14.630> kind<00:03:14.780> of<00:03:14.930> led<00:03:15.590> me<00:03:15.740> to<00:03:15.920> wonder

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:16.190 
deficits it's kind of led me to wonder

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:18.730 
deficits it's kind of led me to wonder
what<00:03:17.000> I<00:03:17.030> could<00:03:17.090> do<00:03:17.390> for<00:03:17.720> you<00:03:17.960> know<00:03:18.560> like<00:03:18.710> a

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:18.740 
what I could do for you know like a

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:20.470 
what I could do for you know like a
regular<00:03:18.980> conventional<00:03:19.310> it<00:03:19.670> because<00:03:19.970> that's

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:20.480 
regular conventional it because that's

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:22.510 
regular conventional it because that's
400<00:03:21.020> pounds<00:03:21.350> and<00:03:21.500> it<00:03:21.560> feels<00:03:21.770> really<00:03:22.160> really

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:22.520 
400 pounds and it feels really really

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:24.160 
400 pounds and it feels really really
easy<00:03:22.820> and<00:03:23.060> that's<00:03:23.240> on<00:03:23.420> a<00:03:23.450> deficit<00:03:23.900> and<00:03:24.020> it's

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:24.170 
easy and that's on a deficit and it's

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:25.720 
easy and that's on a deficit and it's
also<00:03:24.320> after<00:03:24.680> a<00:03:24.710> big<00:03:24.950> session<00:03:25.160> where<00:03:25.400> I'm<00:03:25.460> tired

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:25.730 
also after a big session where I'm tired

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:28.960 
also after a big session where I'm tired
so<00:03:26.000> I<00:03:26.210> am<00:03:27.200> tempted<00:03:27.560> to<00:03:27.920> give<00:03:28.100> convention<00:03:28.640> or<00:03:28.700> go

00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:28.970 
so I am tempted to give convention or go

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:31.180 
so I am tempted to give convention or go
at<00:03:29.120> some<00:03:29.300> point<00:03:29.600> I<00:03:29.780> may<00:03:29.810> well<00:03:30.290> do<00:03:30.470> it<00:03:30.620> before<00:03:30.860> my

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:31.190 
at some point I may well do it before my

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:32.590 
at some point I may well do it before my
competition<00:03:31.370> i'll<00:03:31.730> see<00:03:31.910> how<00:03:32.000> i'm<00:03:32.060> feeling<00:03:32.120> but

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:32.600 
competition i'll see how i'm feeling but

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:34.330 
competition i'll see how i'm feeling but
i<00:03:32.630> would<00:03:32.900> like<00:03:33.050> to<00:03:33.170> see<00:03:33.380> what<00:03:33.950> i<00:03:34.010> can<00:03:34.070> do<00:03:34.310> that

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:34.340 
i would like to see what i can do that

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:36.850 
i would like to see what i can do that
because<00:03:34.670> there's<00:03:35.180> a<00:03:35.300> chance<00:03:35.690> it<00:03:36.560> could<00:03:36.590> be

00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:36.860 
because there's a chance it could be

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:38.200 
because there's a chance it could be
better<00:03:37.100> than<00:03:37.220> my<00:03:37.400> sewer<00:03:37.700> which<00:03:37.970> would<00:03:38.090> be

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:38.210 
better than my sewer which would be

00:03:38.210 --> 00:03:39.940 
better than my sewer which would be
exciting<00:03:38.840> and<00:03:38.870> also<00:03:39.380> a<00:03:39.410> little<00:03:39.560> bit<00:03:39.650> annoying
