00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.110
 so big hello to all today i will 

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:05.790
 speak 

00:00:03.110 --> 00:00:08.160
 exclusively about decorative cosmetics i 

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:11.160
 I'll tell you about my January favorites 

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:13.200
 and the start I wanted to do in my Sturshe 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:16.139
 Basically, I like the mascara 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:18.480
 Saint Laurent and this is one of them I already 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:20.520
 bought a mascara in a brown shade 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:23.070
 I bought this one because 2 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:26.039
 I dried up and here it is very, very straight 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:28.410
 love much sometimes I really don't 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:30.300
 I really like black in makeup eyes 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:32.430
 what seems to me that he is at once 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:34.980
 makes me aggressive 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:37.469
 or vice versa too puppet and i'm for 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:40.620
 how to soften makeup 

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:42.540
 I buy myself sometimes dark blue dark 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:45.030
 brown mascara is sometimes so gray 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:47.850
 green and I really like the result 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:50.190
 wonderful mascaras i'm straight pretty on 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:52.530
 one hundred percent so if you are looking for yourself 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:55.170
 some beautiful brown mascara 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:59.460
 be sure to take a look and look in 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:01:02.940
 Samara and further on without retreating from 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:03.930
 I have one more miniature on this topic. 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:07.290
 appeared 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:09.180
 quenched they flew fired up chanel I 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:11.100
 I don’t use this ink directly 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:13.530
 few years now i like this here 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:14.520
 very mascara and clinics so 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:16.860
 dark green 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:19.259
 but I do not know this mascara, I'm straight 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:21.659
 very very happy here and now I am to her 

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:23.909
 Dyed up and I really like it 

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:25.560
 the result and by the way sometimes even well 

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:27.570
 principle, almost always and not beautiful 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:30.180
 lower lashes because it 's mascara 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:32.490
 so opens your eyes and here if you 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:34.170
 In search of something, I think that to this carcass 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:37.409
 can take a closer look heard from many 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:40.470
 girls positive reviews about this 

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:42.840
 carcasses and by the way about brown not recently 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:45.869
 got such a wonderful liner 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:49.770
 living here I have in brown 

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:51.479
 number two i'm very pleased with this liner 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:54.000
 what I’ve said before and sometimes 

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:56.010
 and I don't want to do my black makeup 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:58.410
 I do not like flowers 

00:01:56.010 --> 00:02:01.170
 use black mascara black liners and 

00:01:58.410 --> 00:02:03.120
 i do it in brown when you 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:05.310
 bring the brush to the color of this liner 

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:07.590
 quite strange some even seems 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:09.860
 little red brown needed after 

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:12.210
 after you apply it to yourself and 

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:14.610
 liner dry up then it becomes 

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:17.160
 dark brown and rather pleasant 

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:18.750
 in color, so this thing too 

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:21.000
 quite occasionally over this liner 

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:22.920
 put some shadows and he is so soft 

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:25.530
 shaded and it turns out very 

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:27.390
 beautiful such effect and the result is not a 

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:28.860
 how can I not brag about me 

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:31.530
 there is a perfume prada candy 

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:35.010
 not my sister gave a set in which 

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:35.690
 included parfum body lotion gel for 

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:40.380
 soul 

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:42.480
 lotion and gi don I gave here I 

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:44.490
 showing a beautiful box and not 

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:46.860
 I really like the smell of this 

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:49.350
 perfume and respectively in gel and 

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:50.130
 lotion because it seems to be and 

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:52.410
 sweet 

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:54.840
 playful but at the same time unobtrusive and 

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:57.240
 he is not heavy by any means that 

00:02:54.840 --> 00:03:00.209
 very important and also wanted to talk about 

00:02:57.240 --> 00:03:02.670
 its behind all concealer tubes and 

00:03:00.209 --> 00:03:04.860
 collistar filler 

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:07.350
 I am very pleased with them especially in the winter 

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:10.110
 time of the year when the skin is sometimes 

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:12.630
 somehow dry or chapped and he 

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:14.700
 I emphasizes peeling and 

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:17.910
 on the contrary it seems to me even somehow 

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:20.070
 moisturize and hide all flaws so 

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:23.040
 that here is this thing I am very pleased and 

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:25.410
 I enjoy using it in the winter and now 

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:27.630
 I want to say about my beautiful varnish for 

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:29.370
 nails I already would have it then 

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:31.769
 gave her sister and still bought 

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:33.840
 I imagine one more thing he told me is very straight 

00:03:31.769 --> 00:03:37.769
 really like a very noble shade 

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:40.010
 With this varnish he can say chameleon 

00:03:37.769 --> 00:03:43.760
 shimmers from 

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:45.769
 turquoise to purple like something like that 

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:48.439
 a little non-standard unusual shade 

00:03:45.769 --> 00:03:52.069
 but he looks very noble I him 

00:03:48.439 --> 00:03:55.730
 straight love and here's what wanted to head 

00:03:52.069 --> 00:03:58.340
 what I can and that's what I wanted to remind 

00:03:55.730 --> 00:04:00.379
 and me, this thing is also a long time 

00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:03.739
 even in them 2 in my opinion such somewhere else 

00:04:00.379 --> 00:04:06.230
 one lies to me right today a day 

00:04:03.739 --> 00:04:10.069
 memories and and analysis of their wands 

00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:11.870
 so this is a perfume tank and there 

00:04:10.069 --> 00:04:14.030
 you can pour any perfume here I have 

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:16.430
 ours there is something irreplaceable and 

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:18.709
 if you need to take the spirit somewhere 

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:21.220
 so as not to carry this huge bottle 

00:04:18.709 --> 00:04:24.169
 that they are still heavy I take with me 

00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:27.590
 Now this small capacitance is at least very 

00:04:24.169 --> 00:04:29.720
 beautiful and sweet and i'm in every 

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:32.150
 Almost video probably in each block 

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:33.710
 talked about how I would go a notch from or 

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:36.680
 still in some shop and buy yourself 

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:38.900
 lipstick finally find something but everything 

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:41.240
 it did not work for her and bought herself 

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:44.030
 lipstick helped me a young man 

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:46.039
 consultant to me right a lot 

00:04:44.030 --> 00:04:47.690

00:04:46.039 --> 00:04:49.849
 I liked one lipstick, that is, we 

00:04:47.690 --> 00:04:52.550

00:04:49.849 --> 00:04:54.949
 and here he really helped me here and me 

00:04:52.550 --> 00:04:56.900
 liked so shade one i say yes 

00:04:54.949 --> 00:04:59.030
 here it is a cool shade he says 

00:04:56.900 --> 00:05:01.220
 it is also a discount of lipstick then eh 

00:04:59.030 --> 00:05:03.139
 the previous collection in general besides 

00:05:01.220 --> 00:05:06.139
 at a great price lipstick to me directly 

00:05:03.139 --> 00:05:07.970

00:05:06.139 --> 00:05:10.270
 estee lauder she me by the way now on 

00:05:07.970 --> 00:05:14.660
 lips 

00:05:10.270 --> 00:05:16.539
 signal another 19 shade of my light 

00:05:14.660 --> 00:05:19.250
 I love the orchid packaging 

00:05:16.539 --> 00:05:21.139
 packaging design the lipstick itself 

00:05:19.250 --> 00:05:23.090
 beautiful here I have been looking for myself 

00:05:21.139 --> 00:05:24.770
 something like that I really like this 

00:05:23.090 --> 00:05:26.599
 hue itself didn't really know what 

00:05:24.770 --> 00:05:30.400
 I wanted but when I saw this lipstick 

00:05:26.599 --> 00:05:34.449
 I realized that I want her 

00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:37.430
 it is very very light in texture and 

00:05:34.449 --> 00:05:39.440
 even when it is eaten, it remains 

00:05:37.430 --> 00:05:41.840
 such an easy light pigment 

00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:44.090
 in any case does not roll does not clog 

00:05:41.840 --> 00:05:45.949
 in the cracks does not emphasize peeling then 

00:05:44.090 --> 00:05:47.960
 what is the way chew yes she already seems 

00:05:45.949 --> 00:05:50.659
 she said it was a moisturizing lipstick 

00:05:47.960 --> 00:05:52.090
 that she is very, very happy, I think 

00:05:50.659 --> 00:05:54.490
 what is the way universal 

00:05:52.090 --> 00:05:56.910
 walls and he is very suitable for me 

00:05:54.490 --> 00:06:00.460
 there is still a bunch of all sorts of gifts for the lines 

00:05:56.910 --> 00:06:02.919
 something there Yandex try me 

00:06:00.460 --> 00:06:04.300
 so many probes are all sorts and I them 

00:06:02.919 --> 00:06:08.860
 I do not use it will be necessary 

00:06:04.300 --> 00:06:10.449
 popolzovatsya and some night 

00:06:08.860 --> 00:06:13.479
 recovery will need more details 

00:06:10.449 --> 00:06:15.669
 read what it is and it is already possible I 

00:06:13.479 --> 00:06:18.370
 I'll try to tell you my opinion later 

00:06:15.669 --> 00:06:20.050
 about this and another very pleasant 

00:06:18.370 --> 00:06:22.410
 my joy is not really like that 

00:06:20.050 --> 00:06:26.380
 this is the shadow of sephora 

00:06:22.410 --> 00:06:28.090
 Well, I do not know the wardrobe to say how to describe I 

00:06:26.380 --> 00:06:30.370
 I didn’t even expect me so 

00:06:28.090 --> 00:06:33.700
 Do you like this palette ? Is it perfect ? 

00:06:30.370 --> 00:06:35.440
 every day option has it all 

00:06:33.700 --> 00:06:37.810
 shades here are three shimmer shades 

00:06:35.440 --> 00:06:39.250
 but not principle all shimmer not watch 

00:06:37.810 --> 00:06:41.740
 then these are all the colors on the eyes are very 

00:06:39.250 --> 00:06:43.120
 beautiful noble I'm right very often 

00:06:41.740 --> 00:06:45.090
 I use you this one 

00:06:43.120 --> 00:06:47.770
 dark brown can 

00:06:45.090 --> 00:06:49.930
 underline eyebrows or darken fold 

00:06:47.770 --> 00:06:51.970
 upper eyelid so here's the straight i don't know 

00:06:49.930 --> 00:06:55.270
 very happy and think what else is not 

00:06:51.970 --> 00:06:57.220
 I'll look at all the handicap and get it, and since 

00:06:55.270 --> 00:06:59.350
 I have such a day of memories that already 

00:06:57.220 --> 00:07:02.260
 too long stayed on the shelf then 

00:06:59.350 --> 00:07:05.950
 I would like to pay attention 

00:07:02.260 --> 00:07:07.870

00:07:07.870 --> 00:07:13.180
 I was given this set and I 

00:07:10.660 --> 00:07:15.099
 periodically with one pencil with another 

00:07:13.180 --> 00:07:18.360
 use it and put it back in 

00:07:15.099 --> 00:07:20.919
 probably most often used black 

00:07:18.360 --> 00:07:23.530
 brown but that's about the others somehow and not 

00:07:20.919 --> 00:07:25.389

00:07:23.530 --> 00:07:28.000
 full size options all these colors 

00:07:25.389 --> 00:07:29.550
 and there is also a very clever river 

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:33.400

00:07:46.090 --> 00:07:49.360
 can say gold with brown 

00:07:48.730 --> 00:07:52.470
 shade 

00:07:49.360 --> 00:07:54.460
