00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:28.190 
provided we find him which I think we

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:29.469 
provided we find him which I think we
will<00:01:28.310> right<00:01:28.520> now<00:01:28.700> I'd<00:01:28.790> really<00:01:29.030> like<00:01:29.149> to<00:01:29.270> find

00:01:29.469 --> 00:01:29.479

will right now I'd really like to find
my<00:01:29.660> arrow

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:30.320 
my arrow

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:34.749 
my arrow
there's<00:01:31.130> my<00:01:31.310> arrow<00:01:33.070> do<00:01:34.070> you<00:01:34.160> went<00:01:34.340> this<00:01:34.520> way<00:01:34.729> I

00:01:34.749 --> 00:01:34.759 
there's my arrow do you went this way I

00:01:34.759 --> 00:01:36.910 
there's my arrow do you went this way I
mean<00:01:35.210> I<00:01:35.300> have<00:01:35.390> a<00:01:35.420> pretty<00:01:35.660> good<00:01:35.810> idea<00:01:36.020> he<00:01:36.800> was

00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:36.920 
mean I have a pretty good idea he was

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:38.170 
mean I have a pretty good idea he was
getting<00:01:37.100> wobbly<00:01:37.580> and<00:01:37.670> I<00:01:37.729> thought<00:01:37.940> he's<00:01:38.060> gonna

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:38.180 
getting wobbly and I thought he's gonna

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:40.200 
getting wobbly and I thought he's gonna
fall<00:01:38.450> down<00:01:38.600> right<00:01:38.810> in<00:01:38.960> front<00:01:39.170> of<00:01:39.259> us<00:01:39.380> there<00:01:39.649> but

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:40.210 
fall down right in front of us there but

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:42.639 
fall down right in front of us there but
then<00:01:41.210> he<00:01:41.300> charged<00:01:41.690> into<00:01:41.810> that<00:01:42.020> fence<00:01:42.289> so<00:01:42.470> my

00:01:42.639 --> 00:01:42.649 
then he charged into that fence so my

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:44.290 
then he charged into that fence so my
guess<00:01:42.860> is<00:01:43.100> he's<00:01:43.250> right<00:01:43.430> in<00:01:43.550> there<00:01:43.670> not<00:01:43.850> too<00:01:44.060> far

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:44.300 
guess is he's right in there not too far

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:50.010 
guess is he's right in there not too far
we'll<00:01:44.990> see

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:50.020 

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:52.920 

let's<00:01:50.440> see<00:01:51.030> see<00:01:52.030> I<00:01:52.060> know<00:01:52.150> he<00:01:52.390> cut<00:01:52.630> in<00:01:52.780> here

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:52.930 
let's see see I know he cut in here

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:53.970 
let's see see I know he cut in here
somewhere<00:01:53.170> so<00:01:53.320> I'm<00:01:53.440> just<00:01:53.590> looking<00:01:53.800> for<00:01:53.920> the

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:53.980 
somewhere so I'm just looking for the

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:57.210 
somewhere so I'm just looking for the
trail<00:01:54.190> that<00:01:54.310> he<00:01:54.400> cut<00:01:54.610> in<00:01:54.730> on<00:01:54.940> and<00:01:55.650> in<00:01:56.650> fact<00:01:56.920> I

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:57.220 
trail that he cut in on and in fact I

00:01:57.220 --> 00:01:59.130 
trail that he cut in on and in fact I
guess<00:01:58.030> I<00:01:58.120> don't<00:01:58.270> really<00:01:58.540> look<00:01:58.750> for<00:01:58.900> the<00:01:58.930> trail

00:01:59.130 --> 00:01:59.140 
guess I don't really look for the trail

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:00.810 
guess I don't really look for the trail
he<00:01:59.230> cut<00:01:59.410> in<00:01:59.530> on<00:01:59.650> because<00:01:59.980> I<00:02:00.190> can<00:02:00.220> see<00:02:00.520> the<00:02:00.610> deers

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:00.820 
he cut in on because I can see the deers

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:06.600 
he cut in on because I can see the deers
rack<00:02:02.490> that's<00:02:03.490> really<00:02:04.000> really<00:02:04.270> nice<00:02:04.570> see<00:02:05.610> urban

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:06.610 
rack that's really really nice see urban

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:09.810 
rack that's really really nice see urban
deer<00:02:06.790> hunting<00:02:07.090> at<00:02:07.180> its<00:02:07.330> best<00:02:08.310> but<00:02:09.310> look<00:02:09.640> at

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:09.820 
deer hunting at its best but look at

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:17.030 
deer hunting at its best but look at
that<00:02:10.000> I<00:02:11.850> see<00:02:14.070> four<00:02:15.070> or<00:02:15.100> five<00:02:15.360> supersonic<00:02:16.360> I

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:17.040 
that I see four or five supersonic I

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:23.400 
that I see four or five supersonic I
guess<00:02:18.040> he's<00:02:18.190> got<00:02:18.310> 11<00:02:18.430> points<00:02:22.020> and<00:02:23.020> he's<00:02:23.200> got

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:23.410 
guess he's got 11 points and he's got

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:26.880 
guess he's got 11 points and he's got
some<00:02:23.650> prawns<00:02:23.890> with<00:02:24.100> his<00:02:24.220> lungs<00:02:25.350> 11<00:02:26.350> point<00:02:26.590> buck

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:28.440 
some prawns with his lungs 11 point buck
it's<00:02:27.340> probably<00:02:27.700> like<00:02:27.820> a<00:02:27.880> three<00:02:28.180> and<00:02:28.239> a<00:02:28.330> half

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:28.450 
it's probably like a three and a half

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:29.010 
it's probably like a three and a half

I must say I was just about right 135
140<00:02:32.470> maybe<00:02:32.680> right<00:02:32.950> in<00:02:32.980> that<00:02:33.160> range<00:02:33.400> you<00:02:34.390> know

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:34.480 
140 maybe right in that range you know

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:36.240 
140 maybe right in that range you know
not<00:02:34.690> a<00:02:34.720> giant<00:02:35.320> like<00:02:35.410> I've<00:02:35.560> killed<00:02:35.770> in<00:02:35.890> Ohio<00:02:36.130> in

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:36.250 
not a giant like I've killed in Ohio in

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:38.270 
not a giant like I've killed in Ohio in
the<00:02:36.310> past<00:02:36.550> but<00:02:36.700> you<00:02:36.760> know<00:02:36.910> what

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:38.280 
the past but you know what

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:40.470 
the past but you know what
sometimes<00:02:39.280> you<00:02:39.370> take<00:02:39.520> what<00:02:39.730> the<00:02:39.760> gift<00:02:40.060> is<00:02:40.270> and

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:40.480 
sometimes you take what the gift is and

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:41.699 
sometimes you take what the gift is and
this<00:02:40.570> was<00:02:40.720> the<00:02:40.810> gift<00:02:41.020> last<00:02:41.320> night<00:02:41.500> this<00:02:41.650> year

00:02:41.699 --> 00:02:41.709
