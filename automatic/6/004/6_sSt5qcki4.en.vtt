when it comes to relocating video

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:27.950 
when it comes to relocating video
there's<00:00:26.310> one<00:00:26.609> simple<00:00:26.970> concept<00:00:27.150> to<00:00:27.660> keep<00:00:27.840> in

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:27.960 
there's one simple concept to keep in

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:31.880 
there's one simple concept to keep in

mind inputs and outputs the Gamecube

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:33.850 
mind inputs and outputs the Gamecube
itself<00:00:32.250> has<00:00:32.430> a<00:00:32.460> bunch<00:00:32.759> of<00:00:32.880> inputs<00:00:33.239> and<00:00:33.329> outputs

for<00:00:34.860> example<00:00:35.309> when<00:00:35.670> you<00:00:35.760> press<00:00:35.940> the<00:00:36.090> a<00:00:36.120> button

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:36.239 
for example when you press the a button

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:38.420 
for example when you press the a button
on<00:00:36.630> your<00:00:36.660> controller<00:00:36.899> that's<00:00:37.710> an<00:00:37.890> input<00:00:38.219> or

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430 
on your controller that's an input or
