 Hello friends, welcome to 

00:00:11.769 --> 00:00:16.590
 review total war 

00:00:12.879 --> 00:00:19.509
 and the body or as barvars rome conquered 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:21.880
 confess after amazed corner 

00:00:19.509 --> 00:00:24.520
 many fingers on the mouse itch 

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:26.919
 and the studio of creativity of the earth struggled 

00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:29.369
 painting their offspring 9 and gray 

00:00:26.919 --> 00:00:31.419
 the goods did not stint on the promise 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:34.480
 list will not be enough 

00:00:31.419 --> 00:00:37.260
 express it so all that was good for u 

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:39.430
 predecessors the best of what was bad 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:41.770
 fix new features 

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:45.220
 add and serve the sauce out 

00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:47.620
 gorgeous picture of game trailers and their 

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:50.650
 delighted the eye and called to decide the fate 

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:53.410
 stories and the body itself was threatened with tough 

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:55.930
 punishment to the great ren that day has come 

00:00:53.410 --> 00:01:00.010
 the world froze anticipation at least 

00:00:55.930 --> 00:01:02.620
 world of fans of the series unfortunately in arrange 

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:04.360
 happy life with a belt franc and the rest 

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:05.049
 having sex on behalf of yourself and those on not 

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:07.299
 will turn out 

00:01:05.049 --> 00:01:09.790
 take the leader of the Huns even gave him 

00:01:07.299 --> 00:01:12.430
 playing a playable character is not 

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:15.460
 apparently to beginner commander of her and 

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:18.310
 his name was glorious we have the phrase and his 

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:19.390
 days of experience because action and action such 

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:23.440
 anyway 

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:25.299
 riot and blame are not so much composed of 

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:26.830
 the game itself and how many problems with 

00:01:25.299 --> 00:01:30.340
 optimization 

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:32.230
 on the version suffered after the fps scheme and 

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:33.030
 periodic departures set 

00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:35.170
 players 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:36.190
 predominantly using let 

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:38.770
 swim cut 

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:40.870
 surely stop the beautiful nasa graphics 

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:43.930
 brushes no requirements were inevitable 

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:46.450
 but when the game starts to lag even on 

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:49.090
 powerful computers successfully manage 

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:51.340
 huge army is very problematic 

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:52.480
 means either dancing bubo in the menu 

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:55.450
 settings either wait 

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:59.530
 fairness patches worth noting 

00:01:55.450 --> 00:02:02.380
 that the first patches and although we eliminated 

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:04.960
 ancestors crash plunge gamers in 

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:06.700
 the rage of the tattoo of the big wheels that game where you can 

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:10.869
 use your fleet endlessly 

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:12.640
 so the game thefts are at the very end of the 90 and not 

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:14.140
 simple battles face massive 

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:18.400
 the extinction of nerve cells that 

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:20.200
 occurred at first game 

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:22.720
 mechanics have changed dramatically 

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:24.780
 relative to the previous parts , we have everything 

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:29.080
 there is also a state of its own 

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:31.570
 brave troops and excessive ambitions for 

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:33.880
 expansion of influence in practice 

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:35.860
 embody these ambitions in life will be oh 

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:39.310
 how not easy especially if you haven't previously 

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:40.090
 I became a product from the series and of course I am writing a set 

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:43.620
 training 

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:46.000
 but to become a successful ruler you can 

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:48.010
 to study a lot of morning gaming 

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:51.040
 improving materials seemed 5 

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:53.709
 typical stone scissors mad cavalry 

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:56.680
 like a red-hot knife smashes into infantry 

00:02:53.709 --> 00:02:57.820
 shredding right and left infantry nimble 

00:02:56.680 --> 00:03:01.989
 seeps through 

00:02:57.820 --> 00:03:02.950
 pikemen poles deftly wielding swords 

00:03:01.989 --> 00:03:05.150
 hatchet them 

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:07.400
 pikemen courtesy 

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:09.140
 cavalrymen do not call for spears 

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:11.209
 canada and 

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:13.640
 kinds of evil guarded by archers 

00:03:11.209 --> 00:03:16.489
 chilling military passions with a rain of arrows 

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:17.959
 does not sound difficult and as if not so 

00:03:16.489 --> 00:03:21.379
 each type of troops 

00:03:17.959 --> 00:03:23.959
 there are unique both common skill 

00:03:21.379 --> 00:03:26.840
 different versions of constructions for different 

00:03:23.959 --> 00:03:29.359
 situations need time to hide the soldiers behind 

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:29.900
 wall of bills need to quickly throw 

00:03:29.359 --> 00:03:32.689
 the enemy 

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:34.609
 shortening the distance after maneuvering 

00:03:32.689 --> 00:03:36.560
 attack stella crush the opponent with 

00:03:34.609 --> 00:03:38.569
 flank necessarily have to consider 

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:40.090
 weather conditions and terrain soldiers like 

00:03:38.569 --> 00:03:42.500
 the rule is not good at fighting 

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:42.769
 having made a march throw through the snowy 

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:47.200
 forest 

00:03:42.769 --> 00:03:48.379
 blizzard followed by filling on the course

 field 

00:03:48.379 --> 00:03:53.450
 who turned up it is not just great 

00:03:50.959 --> 00:03:56.750
 the landscape is not hundreds of n. waging a war not on 

00:03:53.450 --> 00:03:59.720
 life and death in the decoration of smoke and 

00:03:56.750 --> 00:04:02.299
 the dwelling of buildings is dynamically changing 

00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:03.019
 the event opened to learn from them correctly 

00:04:02.299 --> 00:04:05.689
 to react 

00:04:03.019 --> 00:04:08.750
 turning its favor will come out a winner 

00:04:05.689 --> 00:04:11.389
 of many glorious battles otherwise 

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:14.840
 even more powerful prepared army 

00:04:11.389 --> 00:04:17.000
 lose to good tactics developers 

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:19.310
 tried to give you the best players 

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:22.370
 who prefer to conquer nations neither

 new gaming features allows 

00:04:24.470 --> 00:04:28.730
 literally burn it

 Yes, the ground is plunging the enemy

 terrified 

00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:34.310
 even ordinary students do not disdain

 add and gunkan your wall what 

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:37.880
 talk about huge siege machines 

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:39.110
 scatter incendiary shells 

00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:42.830
 city ​​streets 

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:45.200
 or not this whole series is dark and beautiful 

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:49.770
 where we collect the eyes of the USA Come secret 

00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:54.210
 the city is gradually becoming, receive 

00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:56.310
 and set however to forget that the player and 

00:04:54.210 --> 00:04:58.740
 his opponents are equal 

00:04:56.310 --> 00:05:00.690
 conditions if you on takes cool 

00:04:58.740 --> 00:05:01.310
 turnover and enemy troops flock to 

00:05:00.690 --> 00:05:05.370
 sea 

00:05:01.310 --> 00:05:07.440
 strongholds are sometimes better and what can 

00:05:05.370 --> 00:05:10.050
 make a fire 

00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:12.419
 locality and rush to save people 

00:05:10.050 --> 00:05:14.069
 and the enemy will either have to spend the supplies 

00:05:12.419 --> 00:05:16.409
 plenty of time and resources on his 

00:05:14.069 --> 00:05:19.560
 recovery from either thread cozy 

00:05:16.409 --> 00:05:21.810
 wintering in the heat is canceled around alone 

00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:22.770
 walls and ash and this is another 

00:05:21.810 --> 00:05:25.979
 innovation 

00:05:22.770 --> 00:05:27.389
 like the possibility of building barricades 

00:05:25.979 --> 00:05:31.979
 assisting with the siege 

00:05:27.389 --> 00:05:33.810
 if there are chances and could build 

00:05:31.979 --> 00:05:36.750
 get the impression that the goods from 

00:05:33.810 --> 00:05:40.560
 body and then extremely tough cruel 

00:05:36.750 --> 00:05:42.780

00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:44.669
 no desire or ability to do from 

00:05:42.780 --> 00:05:46.910
 skull of the next leader 

00:05:44.669 --> 00:05:49.370
 private bowl 

00:05:46.910 --> 00:05:52.250
 try to share with him bread and salt 

00:05:49.370 --> 00:05:54.530
 diplomacy comes in here 

00:05:52.250 --> 00:05:56.510
 and it is inseparable from the war 

00:05:54.530 --> 00:05:59.330
 turns on just worn on the map 

00:05:56.510 --> 00:06:01.130
 crushing right and wrong every turn 

00:05:59.330 --> 00:06:02.510
 takes time and significant 

00:06:01.130 --> 00:06:04.790
 game years are flying 

00:06:02.510 --> 00:06:08.270
 cities without a player and must 

00:06:04.790 --> 00:06:10.400
 develop comes into decline and cannot 

00:06:08.270 --> 00:06:12.920
 compete with a developing name 

00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:15.430
 neighbors and neighbors themselves are harboring a grudge 

00:06:12.920 --> 00:06:19.220
 can unite and take revenge 

00:06:15.430 --> 00:06:21.350
 self-confident conqueror returned even

 their subjects themselves they may not 

00:06:24.020 --> 00:06:31.720
 they will be delighted, but new ones will appear 

00:06:27.380 --> 00:06:31.720
 levers of political influence 

00:06:32.080 --> 00:06:37.450
 kept their heads changing rapidly 

00:06:34.550 --> 00:06:40.250

 the smallest battle with is fixed in 

00:06:48.230 --> 00:06:53.720
 game chroniclers sprinkle with cheese 2 

00:06:51.500 --> 00:06:56.180
 this system has been optimized now 

00:06:53.720 --> 00:07:00.260
 find information of interest 

00:06:56.180 --> 00:07:03.710

 there is some wooden 

00:07:14.930 --> 00:07:19.169
 animation of the troops but given the scale 

00:07:17.630 --> 00:07:26.430
 battles for this 

00:07:19.169 --> 00:07:28.860
