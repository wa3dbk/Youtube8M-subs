00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:39.270 
have the ground splitter right here this

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:42.350 
have the ground splitter right here this
is<00:00:39.450> this<00:00:39.600> it's<00:00:39.989> kind<00:00:40.320> of<00:00:40.410> see-through<00:00:40.680> egg<00:00:41.460> for

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:42.360

it's a teal color there's that galaxy

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:51.049 
it's a teal color there's that galaxy
circle<00:00:48.510> I'm<00:00:48.600> not<00:00:48.629> sure<00:00:48.899> it's<00:00:49.770> a<00:00:49.890> galaxy<00:00:50.520> circle

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:51.059 
circle I'm not sure it's a galaxy circle

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:54.470 
circle I'm not sure it's a galaxy circle
or<00:00:51.239> what<00:00:51.449> that<00:00:51.600> symbol<00:00:52.170> is<00:00:52.379> called<00:00:53.030> called<00:00:54.030> but

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
some sort of galaxy circle so I'm

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:02.240 
some sort of galaxy circle so I'm
calling<00:01:00.180> it<00:01:00.570> the<00:01:00.629> galaxy<00:01:01.410> circle<00:01:01.800> now<00:01:01.920> but

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
calling it the galaxy circle now but

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:05.870 
calling it the galaxy circle now but
yeah<00:01:03.059> there's<00:01:03.780> that<00:01:03.989> kind<00:01:04.559> of<00:01:04.739> swirl<00:01:05.189> thing<00:01:05.610> in

the center there so I'm just looking up
the<00:01:09.799> galaxy<00:01:10.799> circle<00:01:11.250> yeah<00:01:11.430> it<00:01:12.119> kind<00:01:12.390> of<00:01:12.420> looks

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
the galaxy circle yeah it kind of looks

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:15.020 
the galaxy circle yeah it kind of looks
like<00:01:12.720> it<00:01:13.590> kind<00:01:13.770> of<00:01:13.860> looks<00:01:14.070> like<00:01:14.159> it<00:01:14.430> if<00:01:14.760> you<00:01:14.909> go

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
ground splitter as they call it this

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:27.499 
ground splitter as they call it this
dragon<00:01:25.380> was<00:01:25.560> trained<00:01:26.040> by<00:01:26.490> Alvin<00:01:27.330> the

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:27.509 
dragon was trained by Alvin the

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:31.609 
dragon was trained by Alvin the
treacherous<00:01:27.540> and<00:01:29.479> here<00:01:30.479> he<00:01:30.689> is<00:01:30.900> I<00:01:30.930> think<00:01:31.259> he

learned<00:01:42.150> how<00:01:42.479> to<00:01:42.509> train<00:01:42.930> the<00:01:43.079> dragon<00:01:43.619> from

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310 
learned how to train the dragon from

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:47.420 
learned how to train the dragon from
hiccup<00:01:44.790> and<00:01:45.000> then<00:01:45.210> mildew<00:01:45.750> went<00:01:46.259> to<00:01:47.130> tell

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:00.689 
it is the the ground splitter you'll

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:03.800 
it is the the ground splitter you'll
notice<00:02:01.049> that<00:02:01.290> he's<00:02:01.860> always<00:02:02.250> standing<00:02:03.090> on<00:02:03.299> its

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:03.810 
notice that he's always standing on its

notice that he's always standing on its
tail<00:02:04.200> I<00:02:04.530> don't<00:02:04.710> think<00:02:04.920> this<00:02:05.070> was<00:02:05.310> how<00:02:06.030> the

00:02:06.969 --> 00:02:06.979 
tail I don't think this was how the

00:02:06.979 --> 00:02:09.979
