00:00:00.439 --> 00:00:05.500
 hello and fiorentina about my body in yoga cobbles 

00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:08.429
 your windows 7 computer a lot faster 

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:12.299
 the first thing we are going to do is the system settings of windows 

00:00:12.299 --> 00:00:15.299
 on a minima so do all version 

00:00:16.099 --> 00:00:20.369
 Balleke and Windows Gamer return to the default interface that he has one 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:21.919
 much faster 

00:00:21.919 --> 00:00:24.860
 of course we do so by printing on the winning 

00:00:24.860 --> 00:00:26.679
 and then 

00:00:26.679 --> 00:00:30.909
 right click on this computer or computer 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:34.040
 continue to press off the shelves 

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:38.460
 and then we go to the left side the advanced system settings tab 

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:44.780
 luckily I have a good time under the stations at institutions 

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:49.350
 and as you can see in my example it is automatic 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:52.190
 we are going to adjust to the best performance 

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:53.200
 you'll see 

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:55.670
 that all those check marks also go away right away 

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:58.410
 you can check what the computer leaves 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:01.530
 when it gets up and that it is constantly being charged 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:05.560
 they also advise to click best performance and then the bottom three 

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:08.930
 the city is displaying soft bands around the font 

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:14.480
 Visual style also fans and buttons and fans both minimize the animations 

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:17.600
 maximize to turn on then you still have 

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:21.070
 a bit of a nice ballet and nice pants 

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:23.820
 that is according to apply 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:26.570
 and because it is briefly based on your computer 

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:29.570
 have already done one in the first part 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:32.900
 the next thing we are going to do 

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:34.780
 the search function windows 

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:38.580
 as you may have noticed, that whole cup of tea becomes less certain 

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:40.200
 continuously indexed 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:41.670
 if you search 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:46.700
 is very very busy here to find something well if you put that off 

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:49.950
 saves shirt a lot of computer power 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:52.950
 how do you do that 

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:57.350
 we are going to win the left button am not happy with the right mouse button 

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:58.160
 the computer 

00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:01.160
 we now also print manage 

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:09.449
 and we're going to now 

00:02:09.449 --> 00:02:12.449
 service and applications 

00:02:16.799 --> 00:02:18.629
 press servers 

00:02:18.629 --> 00:02:20.619
 then you have to look carefully 

00:02:20.619 --> 00:02:23.789
 because we are looking make windozers lunch 

00:02:27.399 --> 00:02:30.489
 but the servier 

00:02:30.489 --> 00:02:33.989
 the day follows with the right mouse button and press properties 

00:02:35.419 --> 00:02:38.829
 and as you can see, it is automatically canceled every time 

00:02:40.349 --> 00:02:42.509
 you see banning parkpop 

00:02:42.509 --> 00:02:45.919
 switched off 

00:02:45.919 --> 00:02:48.919
 stop the head 

00:02:50.099 --> 00:02:53.099
 others according to application 

00:02:57.069 --> 00:02:58.559
 and then ok too 

00:02:58.559 --> 00:03:01.139
 truth has now been plotted 

00:03:01.139 --> 00:03:04.139
 You will see that this very quickly comes out of your credit 

00:03:04.879 --> 00:03:08.409
 the next thing we are going to turn off is the users via a counter 

00:03:09.049 --> 00:03:12.359
 this only applies to people who only work on the computer 

00:03:13.059 --> 00:03:16.059
 tip does this by pressing startup 

00:03:16.929 --> 00:03:19.929
 mh control panel 

00:03:21.149 --> 00:03:23.779
 used up his chance 

00:03:23.779 --> 00:03:25.359
 and then on 

00:03:25.359 --> 00:03:28.359
 to click the word extensively 

00:03:29.819 --> 00:03:33.839
 and and click the change settings for more users button 

00:03:38.719 --> 00:03:40.409
 and then you must do it 

00:03:40.409 --> 00:03:44.489
 slider all the way down so for most people step bystanders 

00:03:44.489 --> 00:03:47.059
 following all the way down 

00:03:47.059 --> 00:03:49.859
 you get fewer notifications 

00:03:49.859 --> 00:03:51.959
 saves a lot of irritation 

00:03:51.959 --> 00:03:55.829
 once again you come from above what I in most member states all but just 

00:03:55.829 --> 00:03:58.829
 in this example I had put commander down 

00:04:04.739 --> 00:04:07.039
 well these were with this kind of time 

00:04:07.039 --> 00:04:07.879
 until next time
