I think first time players just won't do
it's<00:00:55.890> something<00:00:56.070> that<00:00:56.550> if<00:00:57.300> you<00:00:57.480> don't<00:00:57.660> do<00:00:58.020> may

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770 
it's something that if you don't do may

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:00.860 
it's something that if you don't do may
cause<00:00:59.039> you<00:00:59.250> to<00:00:59.609> stop<00:00:59.850> playing<00:01:00.149> the<00:01:00.390> game<00:01:00.600> or

they start wailing at them like a
lunatic<00:01:55.759> and<00:01:57.380> the<00:01:58.380> only<00:01:58.500> one<00:01:58.770> I<00:01:58.799> watched

00:01:59.149 --> 00:01:59.159 
lunatic and the only one I watched

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:01.819 
lunatic and the only one I watched
PewDiePie<00:02:00.000> his<00:02:00.149> video<00:02:00.869> his<00:02:01.290> first<00:02:01.590> video<00:02:01.710> I

00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:01.829 
PewDiePie his video his first video I

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:03.350 
PewDiePie his video his first video I
don't<00:02:01.950> know<00:02:02.100> if<00:02:02.159> he's<00:02:02.310> gonna<00:02:02.700> make<00:02:02.909> a<00:02:02.969> second

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:03.360 
don't know if he's gonna make a second

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:07.910 
don't know if he's gonna make a second
one<00:02:03.390> and<00:02:03.869> I<00:02:03.960> watched

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:07.920 

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:14.729 

and<00:02:10.080> I<00:02:11.080> was<00:02:11.200> like<00:02:11.580> yeah<00:02:12.580> I<00:02:13.110> don't<00:02:14.110> think<00:02:14.470> too

00:02:14.729 --> 00:02:14.739 
and I was like yeah I don't think too

00:02:14.739 --> 00:02:16.110 
and I was like yeah I don't think too
many<00:02:14.770> people<00:02:15.340> will<00:02:15.430> just<00:02:15.459> do<00:02:15.790> this<00:02:15.849> because

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:16.120 
many people will just do this because

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:18.600 
many people will just do this because
the<00:02:16.750> game<00:02:17.050> doesn't<00:02:17.410> tell<00:02:17.739> you<00:02:17.890> you<00:02:18.069> can<00:02:18.280> block

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:18.610 
the game doesn't tell you you can block

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:23.280 
the game doesn't tell you you can block
and<00:02:19.510> I<00:02:20.470> think<00:02:21.340> for<00:02:21.730> used<00:02:21.970> to<00:02:22.239> games<00:02:22.569> telling<00:02:23.140> us

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:23.290 
and I think for used to games telling us

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:26.280 
and I think for used to games telling us
we<00:02:23.500> can<00:02:23.739> do<00:02:24.010> this<00:02:24.310> extra<00:02:24.790> stuff<00:02:25.180> it<00:02:25.930> should<00:02:26.140> be

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:26.290 
we can do this extra stuff it should be

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:28.500 
we can do this extra stuff it should be
common<00:02:26.530> I<00:02:27.400> can't<00:02:27.880> even<00:02:28.000> say<00:02:28.209> it<00:02:28.239> should<00:02:28.420> be

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:28.510 
common I can't even say it should be

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:30.199 
common I can't even say it should be
common<00:02:28.660> sense<00:02:28.840> it<00:02:29.140> I<00:02:29.319> guess<00:02:29.470> it<00:02:29.590> should<00:02:29.769> be

00:02:30.199 --> 00:02:30.209 
common sense it I guess it should be

00:02:30.209 --> 00:02:34.220 
common sense it I guess it should be
logical<00:02:31.209> that<00:02:31.300> the<00:02:31.420> game<00:02:31.599> would<00:02:31.750> have<00:02:31.780> a

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:34.230 

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:54.330 

parrying<00:02:35.230> system<00:02:35.739> but<00:02:52.200> waste<00:02:53.200> cannibals<00:02:54.040> like

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:54.340 
parrying system but waste cannibals like

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:56.280 
parrying system but waste cannibals like
I<00:02:54.730> thought<00:02:55.030> this<00:02:55.209> game<00:02:55.390> was<00:02:55.569> difficult<00:02:56.140> this

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:56.290 
I thought this game was difficult this

00:02:56.290 --> 00:03:02.670 
I thought this game was difficult this
shit

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:02.680 

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:05.339 

and<00:03:02.799> I<00:03:02.950> saw<00:03:03.519> comments<00:03:04.090> as<00:03:04.239> well<00:03:04.450> saying<00:03:04.780> this

00:03:05.339 --> 00:03:05.349 
and I saw comments as well saying this

00:03:05.349 --> 00:03:07.440 
and I saw comments as well saying this
is<00:03:05.560> one<00:03:05.830> of<00:03:05.860> the<00:03:06.010> hardest<00:03:06.340> games<00:03:06.430> I<00:03:06.880> have<00:03:07.209> ever

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:07.450 
is one of the hardest games I have ever

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:18.979 
is one of the hardest games I have ever
what<00:03:08.260> he<00:03:08.349> played<00:03:10.950> I<00:03:11.950> saw<00:03:12.880> comments<00:03:13.060> like<00:03:13.390> that

00:03:18.979 --> 00:03:18.989
