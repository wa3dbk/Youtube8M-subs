00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:16.480 
something like that but that would be a

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:18.449 
something like that but that would be a
good<00:02:16.660> picture<00:02:16.900> about<00:02:17.770> when<00:02:17.980> he<00:02:18.069> used<00:02:18.310> in<00:02:18.430> the

not<00:04:06.959> a<00:04:06.989> great<00:04:07.439> shooter<00:04:07.769> but<00:04:08.040> he<00:04:08.129> knocked<00:04:08.340> out<00:04:08.519> a

00:04:08.569 --> 00:04:08.579 
not a great shooter but he knocked out a

00:04:08.579 --> 00:04:10.309

00:04:13.039 --> 00:04:13.049 
to squeeze it off but he I think the

00:04:13.049 --> 00:04:15.170 
to squeeze it off but he I think the
only<00:04:13.199> issue<00:04:13.530> is<00:04:13.739> he's<00:04:14.040> not<00:04:14.250> a<00:04:14.280> great<00:04:14.639> athlete

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:15.180

00:04:17.749 --> 00:04:17.759 
and somewhat of a a limited finisher he

00:04:17.759 --> 00:04:20.899
