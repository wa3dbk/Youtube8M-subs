00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:53.590 
comparisons now the most glaring thing

00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:54.840 
comparisons now the most glaring thing
you'll<00:00:53.710> notice<00:00:53.829> about<00:00:54.010> the<00:00:54.219> trackpad<00:00:54.640> other

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:54.850 
you'll notice about the trackpad other

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:57.209 
you'll notice about the trackpad other
than<00:00:55.090> its<00:00:55.239> monster<00:00:55.809> size<00:00:56.050> is<00:00:56.410> the<00:00:56.620> omission<00:00:57.010> of

00:00:57.209 --> 00:00:57.219 
than its monster size is the omission of

00:00:57.219 --> 00:00:59.819 
than its monster size is the omission of
any<00:00:57.489> recognizable<00:00:58.030> mouse<00:00:58.420> buttons<00:00:58.870> and<00:00:59.079> Apple

00:00:59.819 --> 00:00:59.829 
any recognizable mouse buttons and Apple

00:00:59.829 --> 00:01:02.520 
any recognizable mouse buttons and Apple
solve<00:01:00.219> this<00:01:00.540> by<00:01:01.540> actually<00:01:01.750> making<00:01:02.020> the<00:01:02.230> whole

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:02.530 
solve this by actually making the whole

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:05.069 
solve this by actually making the whole
track<00:01:02.950> pad<00:01:03.190> itself<00:01:03.520> a<00:01:03.760> button<00:01:04.119> and<00:01:04.239> the

00:01:05.069 --> 00:01:05.079 
track pad itself a button and the

00:01:05.079 --> 00:01:06.450 
track pad itself a button and the
concept<00:01:05.649> seems<00:01:05.950> like<00:01:06.189> it'd<00:01:06.310> be<00:01:06.399> very

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:06.460 
concept seems like it'd be very

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:08.310 
concept seems like it'd be very
difficult<00:01:06.759> to<00:01:07.030> get<00:01:07.149> used<00:01:07.180> to<00:01:07.509> and<00:01:07.810> hard<00:01:08.140> to

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:08.320 
difficult to get used to and hard to

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:10.020 
difficult to get used to and hard to
adapt<00:01:08.650> but<00:01:09.250> in<00:01:09.369> fact<00:01:09.490> it's<00:01:09.729> actually<00:01:10.000> very

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:10.030 
adapt but in fact it's actually very

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:12.420 
adapt but in fact it's actually very
quick<00:01:10.659> and<00:01:10.900> took<00:01:11.229> me<00:01:11.350> about<00:01:11.590> five<00:01:11.979> minutes<00:01:12.010> get

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:12.430 
quick and took me about five minutes get

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:13.500 
quick and took me about five minutes get
used<00:01:12.580> to<00:01:12.700> it<00:01:12.820> now<00:01:12.850> I<00:01:12.940> don't<00:01:13.150> notice<00:01:13.360> any

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:13.510 
used to it now I don't notice any

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:16.020 
used to it now I don't notice any
difference<00:01:13.810> at<00:01:13.900> all<00:01:14.250> the<00:01:15.250> whole<00:01:15.430> trackpad

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:16.030 
difference at all the whole trackpad

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:18.300 
difference at all the whole trackpad
like<00:01:16.450> I<00:01:16.540> said<00:01:16.600> is<00:01:16.900> actually<00:01:17.140> a<00:01:17.170> button<00:01:17.440> you
