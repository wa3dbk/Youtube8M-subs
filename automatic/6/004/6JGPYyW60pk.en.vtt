going into the shop and getting a long
piece<00:02:30.430> of<00:02:30.610> steel<00:02:30.940> and<00:02:31.530> using<00:02:32.530> that<00:02:32.560> as<00:02:32.770> a<00:02:32.800> pry

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:33.190 
piece of steel and using that as a pry

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:35.220 
piece of steel and using that as a pry
bar<00:02:33.220> to<00:02:33.550> get<00:02:33.880> this<00:02:34.030> ding<00:02:34.300> box<00:02:34.660> off<00:02:34.930> of<00:02:35.140> this

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:35.230 
bar to get this ding box off of this

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:47.920 
bar to get this ding box off of this
thing

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:47.930 

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:50.060 

but<00:02:48.930> then<00:02:49.080> I<00:02:49.230> was<00:02:49.380> faced<00:02:49.620> with<00:02:49.650> another

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:50.070 
but then I was faced with another

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:52.460 
but then I was faced with another
dilemma<00:02:50.430> now<00:02:50.970> that<00:02:51.150> was<00:02:51.300> off<00:02:51.510> the<00:02:51.780> trailer<00:02:52.260> I

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:52.470 
dilemma now that was off the trailer I

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:54.620 
dilemma now that was off the trailer I
had<00:02:53.070> to<00:02:53.190> try<00:02:53.430> to<00:02:53.490> maneuver<00:02:53.820> it<00:02:54.090> into<00:02:54.270> position

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:54.630 
had to try to maneuver it into position

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:58.430 
had to try to maneuver it into position
next<00:02:55.380> to<00:02:55.800> the<00:02:56.160> other<00:02:56.370> box<00:02:56.880> you<00:02:57.840> can<00:02:58.020> see<00:02:58.200> by<00:02:58.380> the

00:02:58.430 --> 00:02:58.440 
next to the other box you can see by the

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:01.610 
next to the other box you can see by the
picture<00:02:58.530> that<00:02:58.980> the<00:02:59.780> underneath<00:03:00.780> these<00:03:00.990> boxes

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:01.620 
picture that the underneath these boxes

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:05.930 
picture that the underneath these boxes
are<00:03:02.510> a<00:03:03.510> little<00:03:04.410> too<00:03:04.650> by<00:03:04.800> force<00:03:05.130> that<00:03:05.430> are<00:03:05.610> that

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:05.940 
are a little too by force that are that

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:09.320 
are a little too by force that are that
they<00:03:06.120> can<00:03:06.300> that<00:03:07.370> lift<00:03:08.370> the<00:03:08.520> box<00:03:08.730> away<00:03:08.940> from<00:03:09.240> the

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:09.330 
they can that lift the box away from the

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:10.640 
they can that lift the box away from the
ground<00:03:09.570> so<00:03:09.750> they<00:03:09.990> can<00:03:10.140> use<00:03:10.260> a<00:03:10.290> forklift

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:10.650 
ground so they can use a forklift

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:13.340 
ground so they can use a forklift
underneath<00:03:11.340> it<00:03:11.520> well<00:03:12.000> now<00:03:12.570> I<00:03:12.600> kind<00:03:13.020> of<00:03:13.080> screwed

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:13.350 
underneath it well now I kind of screwed

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:16.370 
underneath it well now I kind of screwed
myself<00:03:13.710> and<00:03:14.610> realize<00:03:14.970> that<00:03:15.720> I<00:03:15.750> can't<00:03:16.200> move

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:16.380 
myself and realize that I can't move

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:18.230 
myself and realize that I can't move
this<00:03:16.620> thing<00:03:16.890> it's<00:03:17.160> too<00:03:17.340> heavy<00:03:17.610> for<00:03:17.850> me<00:03:17.940> to<00:03:18.030> try

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:18.240 
this thing it's too heavy for me to try

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:20.960 
this thing it's too heavy for me to try
walking<00:03:18.750> it<00:03:18.900> or<00:03:19.080> rolling<00:03:19.410> it<00:03:19.770> and<00:03:20.460> I<00:03:20.610> can't<00:03:20.820> put

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:20.970 
walking it or rolling it and I can't put

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:23.990 
walking it or rolling it and I can't put
the<00:03:21.090> pry<00:03:21.270> bar<00:03:21.300> underneath<00:03:21.840> it<00:03:22.110> so<00:03:23.100> I<00:03:23.460> to<00:03:23.790> come

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:24.000 
the pry bar underneath it so I to come

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:57.580 
the pry bar underneath it so I to come
up<00:03:24.120> with<00:03:24.240> a<00:03:24.270> different<00:03:24.480> solution

00:03:57.580 --> 00:03:57.590 

00:03:57.590 --> 00:04:00.410
