00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:08.910 
I hate snow the creator of I faith has

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:11.030 
I hate snow the creator of I faith has
just<00:00:09.210> released<00:00:09.330> it<00:00:09.630> today<00:00:09.900> after<00:00:10.559> many<00:00:10.830> months

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:11.040 
just released it today after many months

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:12.799 
just released it today after many months
of<00:00:11.250> work<00:00:11.460> with<00:00:11.670> many<00:00:11.969> developers<00:00:12.570> and

00:00:12.799 --> 00:00:12.809 
of work with many developers and

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:15.560 
of work with many developers and
basically<00:00:13.620> what<00:00:13.769> I<00:00:13.799> faith<00:00:14.190> does<00:00:14.580> is<00:00:14.910> it<00:00:15.330> allows

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:15.570 
basically what I faith does is it allows

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:18.500 
basically what I faith does is it allows

you to save your sh sh blob or file of
the<00:00:18.960> current<00:00:19.410> firmware<00:00:19.710> your<00:00:20.039> device<00:00:20.310> is

the current firmware your device is
running<00:00:20.880> that<00:00:21.420> firmware<00:00:21.930> does<00:00:22.140> not<00:00:22.410> need<00:00:22.590> to

00:00:22.759 --> 00:00:22.769 
running that firmware does not need to

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:25.040 
running that firmware does not need to
be<00:00:22.920> the<00:00:23.100> latest<00:00:23.580> updated<00:00:24.090> firmware<00:00:24.660> that

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:25.050 
be the latest updated firmware that

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:26.720 
be the latest updated firmware that
Apple<00:00:25.410> science<00:00:25.830> so<00:00:26.070> if<00:00:26.160> you're<00:00:26.310> running<00:00:26.490> an

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:23.549 
to update in the future but you're

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:25.190

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 
worried about the new firmware maybe

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:27.380 
worried about the new firmware maybe
there'll<00:01:25.500> be<00:01:25.530> no<00:01:25.799> jailbreak<00:01:26.100> the<00:01:26.759> performance

there'll be no jailbreak the performance

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:28.910 
there'll be no jailbreak the performance
isn't<00:01:27.509> just<00:01:27.780> the<00:01:27.900> same<00:01:28.140> and<00:01:28.439> maybe<00:01:28.710> you'll

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
isn't just the same and maybe you'll

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:30.560 
isn't just the same and maybe you'll
want<00:01:29.100> to<00:01:29.189> downgrade<00:01:29.430> to<00:01:30.090> the<00:01:30.210> current

three point one on the server okay you

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:26.390 
three point one on the server okay you
can<00:03:22.830> also<00:03:23.070> build<00:03:23.700> a<00:03:24.000> custom<00:03:24.450> IPSW<00:03:25.320> with<00:03:25.620> your

can also build a custom IPSW with your

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:29.270 
can also build a custom IPSW with your
sh<00:03:26.910> sh<00:03:27.300> blog<00:03:27.600> that<00:03:28.080> will<00:03:28.170> let<00:03:28.380> iTunes<00:03:28.800> restore
