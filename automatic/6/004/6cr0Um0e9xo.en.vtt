kill a child how can some levels we just

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:33.530 
kill a child how can some levels we just
threw<00:02:32.430> everything<00:02:32.549> in<00:02:32.910> together<00:02:33.209> see<00:02:33.420> what

threw everything in together see what

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:35.870 
threw everything in together see what
would<00:02:33.600> happen<00:02:34.220> we<00:02:35.220> made<00:02:35.370> the<00:02:35.489> multiplayer

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:35.880 
would happen we made the multiplayer

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:42.550 
would happen we made the multiplayer
levels<00:02:36.299> a<00:02:36.390> little<00:02:36.420> bit<00:02:36.720> more<00:02:36.900> challenging

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:42.560 

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:44.800 

I<00:02:42.739> think<00:02:43.489> you<00:02:43.550> got<00:02:43.700> two<00:02:43.880> minds<00:02:44.090> working<00:02:44.420> as<00:02:44.630> one

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:44.810 
I think you got two minds working as one

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:46.150 
I think you got two minds working as one
so<00:02:45.319> that<00:02:45.410> means<00:02:45.560> we<00:02:45.650> got<00:02:45.739> to<00:02:45.770> make<00:02:45.890> it<00:02:45.950> a<00:02:46.040> little

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:46.160 
so that means we got to make it a little

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:51.970 
so that means we got to make it a little
bit<00:02:46.310> more

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:51.980 

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:54.320 

sometimes<00:02:52.980> that<00:02:53.160> co-op<00:02:53.370> play<00:02:53.730> just<00:02:53.970> all<00:02:54.090> comes

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:54.330 
sometimes that co-op play just all comes

00:02:54.330 --> 00:03:01.729 
sometimes that co-op play just all comes
together<00:02:54.510> you<00:02:55.080> know<00:03:00.140> once<00:03:01.140> you've<00:03:01.260> frustrated

00:03:01.729 --> 00:03:01.739 
together you know once you've frustrated

00:03:01.739 --> 00:03:02.930 
together you know once you've frustrated
enough<00:03:01.890> with<00:03:02.040> working<00:03:02.340> with<00:03:02.370> your<00:03:02.610> friends
