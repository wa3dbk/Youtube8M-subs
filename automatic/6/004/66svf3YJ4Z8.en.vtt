line over a chord progression so what

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:18.560

you see in front of you on the screen is
a<00:00:18.600> fairly<00:00:18.869> typical<00:00:19.050> chord<00:00:19.529> chart<00:00:19.970> if<00:00:20.970> you're<00:00:21.150> a

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:21.210 
a fairly typical chord chart if you're a

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:22.640 
a fairly typical chord chart if you're a
guitar<00:00:21.359> player<00:00:21.570> or<00:00:21.869> a<00:00:22.020> bass<00:00:22.230> player<00:00:22.410> or<00:00:22.590> even

guitar player or a bass player or even
the<00:00:22.830> drummer<00:00:23.070> sometimes<00:00:23.519> you'll<00:00:23.640> just<00:00:23.760> get<00:00:23.880> a

00:00:23.929 --> 00:00:23.939 
the drummer sometimes you'll just get a

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:25.330 
the drummer sometimes you'll just get a
chart<00:00:24.390> like<00:00:24.449> that<00:00:24.660> and<00:00:24.810> you're<00:00:24.900> expected<00:00:25.289> to

00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:25.340 
chart like that and you're expected to

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:28.790 
chart like that and you're expected to
create<00:00:26.340> a<00:00:26.550> part<00:00:27.050> that's<00:00:28.050> appropriate<00:00:28.590> for<00:00:28.619> the

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:28.800 
create a part that's appropriate for the

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:32.430 
need to do is understand the structure

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:36.139 
need to do is understand the structure
of<00:00:32.460> the<00:00:32.640> chord<00:00:33.420> chart<00:00:34.460> okay<00:00:35.460> so<00:00:35.520> if<00:00:35.760> we<00:00:35.850> look<00:00:36.000> up

00:00:36.139 --> 00:00:36.149 
of the chord chart okay so if we look up

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:37.760 
of the chord chart okay so if we look up
here<00:00:36.329> we've<00:00:36.899> got<00:00:37.050> this<00:00:37.170> thing<00:00:37.230> here<00:00:37.530> this<00:00:37.590> is<00:00:37.739> a

bass clef such shows that this is a

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:42.799 
bass clef such shows that this is a
specific<00:00:41.399> chart<00:00:42.030> for<00:00:42.180> a<00:00:42.239> bass<00:00:42.390> clef

this case and we've got this thing for

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:48.770 
this case and we've got this thing for
four<00:00:46.860> which<00:00:47.489> is<00:00:47.730> a<00:00:47.760> time<00:00:48.030> signature<00:00:48.360> it<00:00:48.539> shows

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
four which is a time signature it shows

you that we've got four bits in the bar

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:51.709 
you that we've got four bits in the bar
that's<00:00:50.940> the<00:00:51.030> most<00:00:51.180> common<00:00:51.360> time<00:00:51.690> signature

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719 
that's the most common time signature

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:54.889 
that's the most common time signature
you'll<00:00:52.559> come<00:00:52.710> across<00:00:53.239> now<00:00:54.239> these<00:00:54.480> symbols

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
here are the chord symbols so if you've

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:01.490 
here are the chord symbols so if you've
got<00:00:59.039> a<00:00:59.100> just<00:00:59.760> a<00:00:59.879> letter<00:01:00.090> name<00:01:00.300> like<00:01:00.510> C<00:01:00.840> or<00:01:01.109> G

not sure about what that means go back

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:10.780 
not sure about what that means go back
and<00:01:09.150> have<00:01:09.240> a<00:01:09.270> look<00:01:09.390> at<00:01:09.479> some<00:01:09.600> of<00:01:09.720> our<00:01:09.810> videos<00:01:10.140> on

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:10.790 
and have a look at some of our videos on

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:13.010 
and have a look at some of our videos on
building<00:01:11.790> courts<00:01:12.119> in<00:01:12.210> the<00:01:12.270> backyard<00:01:12.630> basis

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
building courts in the backyard basis

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:14.920 
building courts in the backyard basis
and<00:01:13.320> it's<00:01:13.650> really<00:01:13.830> important<00:01:14.130> you<00:01:14.189> understand

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:14.930 
and it's really important you understand

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:18.230 
and it's really important you understand
what<00:01:15.930> those<00:01:16.110> mean<00:01:16.350> and<00:01:16.729> what<00:01:17.729> the<00:01:17.820> fretboard

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 
what those mean and what the fretboard

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:20.300 
what those mean and what the fretboard
patterns<00:01:18.720> for<00:01:18.900> those<00:01:19.049> are<00:01:19.259> let<00:01:20.040> me<00:01:20.100> get<00:01:20.220> to

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
patterns for those are let me get to

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:22.370 
patterns for those are let me get to
this<00:01:20.400> one<00:01:20.580> we've<00:01:20.759> got<00:01:20.790> a<00:01:21.119> with<00:01:21.750> a<00:01:21.780> lowercase<00:01:22.049> M

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.380 
this one we've got a with a lowercase M

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:25.010 
this one we've got a with a lowercase M
that's<00:01:22.530> a<00:01:22.680> minor<00:01:23.299> so<00:01:24.299> the<00:01:24.420> lowercase<00:01:24.689> M

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
that's a minor so the lowercase M

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:27.700 
that's a minor so the lowercase M
denotes<00:01:25.229> that<00:01:25.470> that's<00:01:25.680> a<00:01:25.770> minor<00:01:26.009> chord<00:01:26.450> okay

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:27.710 
denotes that that's a minor chord okay

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:30.170 
denotes that that's a minor chord okay
so<00:01:28.710> starting<00:01:29.490> at<00:01:29.610> the<00:01:29.670> start<00:01:29.729> we've<00:01:29.939> got<00:01:30.090> an

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180 
so starting at the start we've got an

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:33.830 
so starting at the start we've got an
intro<00:01:30.650> now<00:01:31.650> this<00:01:32.549> is<00:01:32.820> the<00:01:33.000> C<00:01:33.150> chord<00:01:33.180> here<00:01:33.570> you

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
intro now this is the C chord here you

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:35.569 
intro now this is the C chord here you
continue<00:01:34.439> playing<00:01:34.680> C<00:01:35.040> even<00:01:35.250> though<00:01:35.340> there's

00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:35.579 
continue playing C even though there's

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:38.270 
continue playing C even though there's
no<00:01:35.909> chord<00:01:36.210> chart<00:01:36.509> and<00:01:36.750> that<00:01:36.780> chord<00:01:37.200> symbol<00:01:37.530> you

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280 
no chord chart and that chord symbol you

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:39.830 
no chord chart and that chord symbol you
doesn't<00:01:38.700> mean<00:01:38.790> don't<00:01:38.970> play<00:01:39.210> it<00:01:39.270> means<00:01:39.450> keep

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 
doesn't mean don't play it means keep

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:41.810 
doesn't mean don't play it means keep
playing<00:01:40.170> the<00:01:40.320> same<00:01:40.530> chord<00:01:40.860> so<00:01:41.640> I've<00:01:41.700> actually

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 
playing the same chord so I've actually

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:44.480 
playing the same chord so I've actually
got<00:01:42.060> two<00:01:42.210> bars<00:01:42.420> on<00:01:42.600> C<00:01:42.869> there<00:01:43.100> this<00:01:44.100> thing<00:01:44.280> here

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 
got two bars on C there this thing here

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:47.600 
got two bars on C there this thing here
is<00:01:44.549> a<00:01:44.579> repeat<00:01:44.909> sign<00:01:45.530> the<00:01:46.530> double<00:01:46.829> dots<00:01:47.340> in<00:01:47.549> the

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:47.610 
is a repeat sign the double dots in the

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:49.670 
is a repeat sign the double dots in the
double<00:01:47.850> bar<00:01:48.000> line<00:01:48.210> shows<00:01:49.020> it's<00:01:49.200> repeat<00:01:49.500> time

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:49.680 
double bar line shows it's repeat time

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:50.810 
double bar line shows it's repeat time
what<00:01:49.829> that<00:01:49.860> means<00:01:50.130> is<00:01:50.280> somewhere<00:01:50.549> along<00:01:50.700> the

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:50.820 
what that means is somewhere along the

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:52.670 
what that means is somewhere along the
track<00:01:51.060> we're<00:01:51.659> gonna<00:01:51.780> repeat<00:01:52.110> back<00:01:52.380> to<00:01:52.590> this

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:52.680 
track we're gonna repeat back to this

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:55.160 
track we're gonna repeat back to this
point<00:01:52.950> in<00:01:53.159> the<00:01:53.250> tune<00:01:53.490> I<00:01:53.820> call<00:01:54.780> this<00:01:54.899> bit<00:01:55.079> the

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:55.170 
point in the tune I call this bit the

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:57.889 
point in the tune I call this bit the
verse<00:01:55.380> so<00:01:56.250> we've<00:01:56.369> got<00:01:56.520> a<00:01:56.549> bar<00:01:56.759> of<00:01:56.880> C<00:01:57.119> and<00:01:57.479> bar<00:01:57.810> of

00:01:57.889 --> 00:01:57.899 
verse so we've got a bar of C and bar of

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:02.569 
verse so we've got a bar of C and bar of
G<00:01:58.140> bar<00:01:58.920> of<00:01:59.040> a<00:01:59.159> minor<00:01:59.460> F<00:02:00.000> and<00:02:00.960> so<00:02:01.170> on<00:02:01.430> let<00:02:02.430> me<00:02:02.460> get

00:02:02.569 --> 00:02:02.579 
G bar of a minor F and so on let me get

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:04.670 
G bar of a minor F and so on let me get
to<00:02:02.700> here<00:02:02.820> we've<00:02:02.939> got<00:02:03.060> a<00:02:03.090> double<00:02:03.299> bar<00:02:03.570> line<00:02:03.840> this

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:04.680 
to here we've got a double bar line this

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:05.959 
to here we've got a double bar line this
doesn't<00:02:04.979> mean<00:02:05.070> repeat<00:02:05.399> it<00:02:05.549> just<00:02:05.579> means

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:05.969 
doesn't mean repeat it just means

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:07.399 
doesn't mean repeat it just means
because<00:02:06.329> it's<00:02:06.450> not<00:02:06.570> there's<00:02:06.750> no<00:02:06.840> dots<00:02:07.110> there's

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:07.409 
because it's not there's no dots there's

because it's not there's no dots there's
just<00:02:07.619> the<00:02:07.710> double<00:02:07.979> bar<00:02:08.129> line<00:02:08.369> it<00:02:08.940> shows<00:02:09.270> us

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:09.420 
just the double bar line it shows us

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:10.760 
just the double bar line it shows us
we're<00:02:09.569> going<00:02:09.780> into<00:02:09.929> a<00:02:09.989> different<00:02:10.170> section<00:02:10.679> of

chord two bars of G two bars of F two
bars<00:02:22.500> of<00:02:22.590> G<00:02:22.800> you<00:02:23.670> get<00:02:23.790> to<00:02:23.880> this<00:02:24.000> section<00:02:24.180> one

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:24.480 
bars of G you get to this section one

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:27.050 
bars of G you get to this section one
called<00:02:24.660> the<00:02:24.750> chorus<00:02:25.640> and<00:02:26.640> notice<00:02:26.970> that

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:27.060 
called the chorus and notice that

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:28.640 
called the chorus and notice that
there's<00:02:27.270> two<00:02:27.450> chords<00:02:27.870> in<00:02:27.930> each<00:02:28.050> bar<00:02:28.290> so<00:02:28.530> each

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:28.650 
there's two chords in each bar so each

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:29.990 
there's two chords in each bar so each
one<00:02:28.830> of<00:02:28.920> those<00:02:29.040> chords<00:02:29.400> is<00:02:29.460> only<00:02:29.610> worth<00:02:29.790> two

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:30.000 
one of those chords is only worth two

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.320 
one of those chords is only worth two
beats<00:02:30.240> so<00:02:31.110> I've<00:02:31.170> got<00:02:31.290> two<00:02:31.470> beats<00:02:31.710> on<00:02:31.860> C<00:02:32.130> T<00:02:33.090> beats

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:33.330 
beats so I've got two beats on C T beats

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:36.080 
beats so I've got two beats on C T beats
on<00:02:33.540> a<00:02:33.690> two<00:02:34.230> bits<00:02:34.440> on<00:02:34.590> F<00:02:34.770> two<00:02:35.220> bits<00:02:35.400> and<00:02:35.580> G<00:02:35.730> on<00:02:35.850> so

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:36.090 
on a two bits on F two bits and G on so

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:38.900 
on a two bits on F two bits and G on so
on<00:02:36.240> now<00:02:37.050> notice<00:02:37.350> that<00:02:37.380> this<00:02:37.680> bar<00:02:38.220> is<00:02:38.550> actually

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:38.910 
on now notice that this bar is actually

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:41.030 
on now notice that this bar is actually
longer<00:02:39.180> than<00:02:39.330> this<00:02:39.780> one<00:02:39.990> that<00:02:40.620> doesn't<00:02:40.650> really

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:41.040 
longer than this one that doesn't really

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:43.130 
longer than this one that doesn't really
mean<00:02:41.340> anything<00:02:41.610> of<00:02:42.060> great<00:02:42.300> significance<00:02:42.660> it's

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:43.140 
mean anything of great significance it's

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:45.230 
mean anything of great significance it's
just<00:02:43.320> the<00:02:43.440> music<00:02:43.530> software<00:02:44.010> I<00:02:44.130> used<00:02:44.340> to<00:02:44.490> print

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:45.240 
just the music software I used to print

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:47.150 
just the music software I used to print
this<00:02:45.390> chart<00:02:45.690> out<00:02:45.900> that's<00:02:46.740> the<00:02:46.860> way<00:02:47.010> it's

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:47.160 
this chart out that's the way it's

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:49.610 
this chart out that's the way it's
typeset<00:02:47.580> it<00:02:47.670> so<00:02:47.760> it's<00:02:47.850> just<00:02:48.000> made<00:02:48.150> that<00:02:48.620> bigger

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:49.620 
typeset it so it's just made that bigger

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:50.750 
typeset it so it's just made that bigger
because<00:02:49.710> there's<00:02:49.920> only<00:02:50.010> four<00:02:50.280> bars<00:02:50.430> in<00:02:50.640> that

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:50.760 
because there's only four bars in that

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:52.670 
because there's only four bars in that
line<00:02:50.970> okay<00:02:51.540> so<00:02:51.720> it<00:02:51.870> doesn't<00:02:52.110> mean<00:02:52.230> it's<00:02:52.440> longer

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:52.680 
line okay so it doesn't mean it's longer

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:54.680 
line okay so it doesn't mean it's longer
or<00:02:52.860> anything<00:02:53.010> like<00:02:53.250> that<00:02:53.300> now<00:02:54.300> when<00:02:54.420> we<00:02:54.510> play

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:54.690 
or anything like that now when we play

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:56.900 
or anything like that now when we play
through<00:02:54.930> that<00:02:55.110> section<00:02:55.860> there's<00:02:56.460> a<00:02:56.610> repeat

00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:56.910 
through that section there's a repeat

00:02:56.910 --> 00:02:58.250 
through that section there's a repeat
sign<00:02:57.120> so<00:02:57.240> we're<00:02:57.330> going<00:02:57.420> to<00:02:57.480> go<00:02:57.600> right<00:02:57.780> back<00:02:57.990> to

00:02:58.250 --> 00:02:58.260 
sign so we're going to go right back to

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:03.170 
sign so we're going to go right back to
the<00:02:59.250> verse<00:02:59.430> and<00:02:59.730> do<00:02:59.970> it<00:03:00.060> all<00:03:00.150> again<00:03:01.640> and<00:03:02.640> then

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:03.180 
the verse and do it all again and then

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:04.610 
the verse and do it all again and then
this<00:03:03.480> section<00:03:03.720> is<00:03:03.900> called<00:03:04.050> the<00:03:04.140> bridge<00:03:04.350> I

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:04.620 
this section is called the bridge I

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:05.720 
this section is called the bridge I
guess<00:03:04.860> because<00:03:05.010> it<00:03:05.220> takes<00:03:05.430> us<00:03:05.580> somewhere

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:05.730 
guess because it takes us somewhere

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:07.010 
guess because it takes us somewhere
different<00:03:06.000> it<00:03:06.210> goes<00:03:06.360> somewhere<00:03:06.630> different

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:07.020 
different it goes somewhere different

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:10.100 
different it goes somewhere different
and<00:03:07.830> we've<00:03:07.950> got<00:03:08.100> two<00:03:08.250> bars<00:03:08.460> of<00:03:08.610> a<00:03:08.700> minor<00:03:09.110> two

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:10.110 
and we've got two bars of a minor two

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:12.950 
and we've got two bars of a minor two
bars<00:03:10.320> of<00:03:10.440> e<00:03:10.680> minor<00:03:10.950> two<00:03:11.730> bars<00:03:11.940> of<00:03:12.030> a<00:03:12.180> minor<00:03:12.210> two

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:12.960 
bars of e minor two bars of a minor two

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:14.930 
bars of e minor two bars of a minor two
bars<00:03:13.170> of<00:03:13.290> G<00:03:13.320> and<00:03:13.770> then<00:03:14.400> we're<00:03:14.550> back<00:03:14.580> to<00:03:14.730> this

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:14.940 
bars of G and then we're back to this

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:16.520 
bars of G and then we're back to this
progression<00:03:15.480> we<00:03:15.540> had<00:03:15.690> in<00:03:15.810> the<00:03:15.870> chorus<00:03:16.140> before

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:16.530 
progression we had in the chorus before

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:19.580 
progression we had in the chorus before
and<00:03:16.740> notice<00:03:17.670> that<00:03:17.940> we've<00:03:18.900> got<00:03:19.080> a<00:03:19.110> repeat<00:03:19.380> sign

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:19.590 
and notice that we've got a repeat sign

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:22.760 
and notice that we've got a repeat sign
so<00:03:19.830> we<00:03:19.920> do<00:03:20.040> it<00:03:20.160> twice<00:03:21.200> the<00:03:22.200> last<00:03:22.410> note<00:03:22.650> I've

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:22.770 
so we do it twice the last note I've

00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:26.240 
so we do it twice the last note I've
notated<00:03:23.280> as<00:03:23.400> a<00:03:23.430> a<00:03:23.760> note<00:03:24.660> there<00:03:24.900> to<00:03:25.080> C<00:03:25.380> chords<00:03:25.860> C

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:26.250 
notated as a a note there to C chords C

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:28.640 
notated as a a note there to C chords C
note<00:03:26.459> and<00:03:26.670> this<00:03:27.330> thing<00:03:27.570> above<00:03:27.870> it<00:03:28.020> is<00:03:28.140> called<00:03:28.590> a

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:28.650 
note and this thing above it is called a

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:31.940 
note and this thing above it is called a
porcine<00:03:29.160> or<00:03:29.220> a<00:03:29.400> Fermata<00:03:29.730> and<00:03:30.620> that<00:03:31.620> just<00:03:31.770> means

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:31.950 
porcine or a Fermata and that just means

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:33.980 
porcine or a Fermata and that just means
you<00:03:32.040> hold<00:03:32.190> on<00:03:32.370> to<00:03:32.490> that<00:03:32.610> note<00:03:32.850> longer<00:03:33.750> than

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:33.990 
you hold on to that note longer than

00:03:33.990 --> 00:03:36.199 
you hold on to that note longer than
four<00:03:34.230> beats<00:03:34.580> beyond<00:03:35.580> the<00:03:35.670> last<00:03:35.820> note<00:03:36.090> of<00:03:36.120> the

00:03:36.199 --> 00:03:36.209 
four beats beyond the last note of the

00:03:36.209 --> 00:03:38.570 
four beats beyond the last note of the
song<00:03:36.270> and<00:03:36.750> someone<00:03:37.650> will<00:03:37.740> cut<00:03:38.160> you<00:03:38.280> off<00:03:38.400> at<00:03:38.550> the

00:03:38.570 --> 00:03:38.580 
song and someone will cut you off at the

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:40.550 
song and someone will cut you off at the
end<00:03:38.760> of<00:03:38.850> that<00:03:38.970> you<00:03:39.510> could<00:03:39.660> have<00:03:39.840> a<00:03:39.870> poor<00:03:40.260> sign

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:40.560 
end of that you could have a poor sign

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:41.930 
end of that you could have a poor sign
somewhere<00:03:40.920> during<00:03:41.100> the<00:03:41.280> piece<00:03:41.610> which<00:03:41.790> will

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:41.940 
somewhere during the piece which will

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:43.760 
somewhere during the piece which will
mean<00:03:42.060> you<00:03:42.180> just<00:03:42.330> go<00:03:42.480> along<00:03:42.660> and<00:03:42.720> pause<00:03:43.470> at<00:03:43.650> that

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:43.770 
mean you just go along and pause at that

00:03:43.770 --> 00:03:45.230 
mean you just go along and pause at that
point<00:03:44.040> for<00:03:44.310> a<00:03:44.340> little<00:03:44.490> bit<00:03:44.610> and<00:03:44.790> then<00:03:44.970> go<00:03:45.120> on

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:45.240 
point for a little bit and then go on

00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:47.420 
point for a little bit and then go on
again<00:03:45.480> but<00:03:46.260> nine<00:03:46.470> times<00:03:46.500> out<00:03:46.890> of<00:03:46.950> ten<00:03:47.220> you're

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:47.430 
again but nine times out of ten you're

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:52.310 
again but nine times out of ten you're
gonna<00:03:47.520> see<00:03:47.730> it<00:03:47.790> at<00:03:47.910> the<00:03:48.030> end<00:03:48.150> of<00:03:48.270> the<00:03:48.330> song<00:03:51.320> okay

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:52.320 
gonna see it at the end of the song okay

00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:53.870 
gonna see it at the end of the song okay
now<00:03:52.470> let's<00:03:52.680> look<00:03:52.740> at<00:03:52.980> what<00:03:53.100> we<00:03:53.220> can<00:03:53.340> do<00:03:53.520> to

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:53.880 
now let's look at what we can do to

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:55.130 
now let's look at what we can do to
create<00:03:54.000> a<00:03:54.150> baseline<00:03:54.480> over<00:03:54.600> this<00:03:54.930> chord

00:03:55.130 --> 00:03:55.140 
create a baseline over this chord

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:57.770 
create a baseline over this chord
progression<00:03:55.550> the<00:03:56.550> most<00:03:57.030> obvious<00:03:57.390> thing<00:03:57.570> to<00:03:57.600> do

00:03:57.770 --> 00:03:57.780 
progression the most obvious thing to do

00:03:57.780 --> 00:03:59.900 
progression the most obvious thing to do
is<00:03:57.900> to<00:03:58.020> play<00:03:58.170> the<00:03:58.200> root<00:03:58.440> notes<00:03:58.680> what<00:03:59.550> I<00:03:59.580> mean<00:03:59.790> by

00:03:59.900 --> 00:03:59.910 
is to play the root notes what I mean by

00:03:59.910 --> 00:04:01.820 
is to play the root notes what I mean by
that<00:04:00.090> is<00:04:00.330> in<00:04:00.480> the<00:04:00.600> first<00:04:00.780> bar<00:04:01.110> if<00:04:01.440> you've<00:04:01.650> got<00:04:01.800> a

00:04:01.820 --> 00:04:01.830 
that is in the first bar if you've got a

00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:04.610 
that is in the first bar if you've got a
chord<00:04:02.100> C<00:04:02.420> you<00:04:03.420> play<00:04:03.600> the<00:04:03.720> note<00:04:03.870> C<00:04:04.140> if<00:04:04.410> you've

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:04.620 
chord C you play the note C if you've

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:06.590 
chord C you play the note C if you've
got<00:04:04.770> a<00:04:04.800> G<00:04:05.010> you<00:04:05.160> play<00:04:05.340> a<00:04:05.370> G<00:04:05.640> if<00:04:06.180> you've<00:04:06.330> got<00:04:06.450> a

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:06.600 
got a G you play a G if you've got a

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:09.080 
got a G you play a G if you've got a
minor<00:04:06.870> you<00:04:07.200> play<00:04:07.500> a<00:04:07.709> so<00:04:08.580> playing<00:04:08.820> the<00:04:08.910> root

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:09.090 
minor you play a so playing the root

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:11.020 
minor you play a so playing the root
note<00:04:09.300> means<00:04:09.630> playing<00:04:09.900> the<00:04:10.050> same<00:04:10.380> letter<00:04:10.709> name

00:04:11.020 --> 00:04:11.030 
note means playing the same letter name

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:15.229 
note means playing the same letter name
but<00:04:12.030> the<00:04:12.120> chords<00:04:12.420> got<00:04:13.520> and<00:04:14.520> then<00:04:14.640> we<00:04:14.730> look<00:04:15.180> at

00:04:15.229 --> 00:04:15.239 
but the chords got and then we look at

00:04:15.239 --> 00:04:16.520 
but the chords got and then we look at
some<00:04:15.300> different<00:04:15.480> rhythms<00:04:15.870> we<00:04:15.989> can<00:04:16.140> play<00:04:16.290> to

00:04:16.520 --> 00:04:16.530 
some different rhythms we can play to

00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:19.190 
some different rhythms we can play to
start<00:04:16.770> off<00:04:16.859> with<00:04:17.010> let's<00:04:17.040> just<00:04:17.370> play<00:04:18.200> semibreve

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:19.200 
start off with let's just play semibreve

00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:21.800 
start off with let's just play semibreve
the<00:04:19.440> whole<00:04:19.620> notes<00:04:19.890> suffer<00:04:20.640> if<00:04:21.299> i<00:04:21.390> start<00:04:21.660> at<00:04:21.720> the

00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:21.810 
the whole notes suffer if i start at the

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:27.260 
the whole notes suffer if i start at the
verse<00:04:21.960> i<00:04:22.350> start<00:04:23.250> here<00:04:23.840> one<00:04:24.840> two<00:04:25.410> three<00:04:26.070> four

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:27.270 
verse i start here one two three four

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:37.500 
verse i start here one two three four
see<00:04:28.560> G<00:04:29.560> a<00:04:31.260> F<00:04:34.290> and<00:04:35.290> so<00:04:35.560> on<00:04:35.710> okay<00:04:36.400> so<00:04:37.210> that's<00:04:37.330> one

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:37.510 
see G a F and so on okay so that's one

00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:40.230 
see G a F and so on okay so that's one
option<00:04:37.690> or<00:04:38.050> I<00:04:38.590> could<00:04:38.950> play<00:04:39.160> a<00:04:39.520> slightly<00:04:40.060> more

00:04:40.230 --> 00:04:40.240 
option or I could play a slightly more

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:52.130 
option or I could play a slightly more
interesting<00:04:40.480> rhythm<00:04:40.930> one<00:04:41.710> two<00:04:41.910> three<00:04:42.910> four<00:04:43.480> a

00:04:52.130 --> 00:04:52.140 

00:04:52.140 --> 00:04:54.780 

third<00:04:53.140> option<00:04:53.320> could<00:04:53.650> be<00:04:53.710> to<00:04:54.070> play<00:04:54.340> quavers

00:04:54.780 --> 00:04:54.790 
third option could be to play quavers

00:04:54.790 --> 00:05:07.030 
third option could be to play quavers
one<00:04:55.630> two<00:04:56.140> three<00:04:56.740> four

00:05:07.030 --> 00:05:07.040 

00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:09.290 

okay<00:05:08.040> and<00:05:08.250> you<00:05:08.370> could<00:05:08.490> probably<00:05:08.729> think<00:05:08.880> upper

00:05:09.290 --> 00:05:09.300 
okay and you could probably think upper

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:10.670 
okay and you could probably think upper
some<00:05:09.540> of<00:05:09.690> your<00:05:09.810> own<00:05:09.960> rhythms<00:05:10.320> that<00:05:10.380> you<00:05:10.500> could

00:05:10.670 --> 00:05:10.680 
some of your own rhythms that you could

00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:16.070 
some of your own rhythms that you could
try<00:05:10.889> over<00:05:11.100> there<00:05:14.600> now<00:05:15.600> it's<00:05:15.750> not<00:05:15.840> gonna<00:05:15.960> be<00:05:16.050> a

00:05:16.070 --> 00:05:16.080 
try over there now it's not gonna be a

00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:17.150 
try over there now it's not gonna be a
lot<00:05:16.169> of<00:05:16.229> action<00:05:16.410> happening<00:05:16.710> on<00:05:16.949> the<00:05:17.039> screen

00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:17.160 
lot of action happening on the screen

00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:19.249 
lot of action happening on the screen
for<00:05:17.580> the<00:05:17.639> rest<00:05:17.970> of<00:05:18.090> this<00:05:18.240> video<00:05:18.539> but<00:05:19.080> what<00:05:19.229> I

00:05:19.249 --> 00:05:19.259 
for the rest of this video but what I

for the rest of this video but what I
want<00:05:19.440> you<00:05:19.500> to<00:05:19.620> try<00:05:19.830> and<00:05:19.979> do<00:05:20.100> is<00:05:20.160> use<00:05:20.370> those

want you to try and do is use those

00:05:20.550 --> 00:05:24.999 
want you to try and do is use those
three<00:05:20.759> options<00:05:20.970> long<00:05:21.720> notes<00:05:22.699> this<00:05:23.699> pattern

00:05:24.999 --> 00:05:25.009 
three options long notes this pattern

00:05:25.009 --> 00:05:29.480 
three options long notes this pattern
and<00:05:26.009> the<00:05:26.160> eighth<00:05:26.280> notes<00:05:26.550> of<00:05:26.729> quavers<00:05:28.490> just

00:05:29.480 --> 00:05:29.490 
and the eighth notes of quavers just

00:05:29.490 --> 00:05:30.620 
and the eighth notes of quavers just
using<00:05:29.759> the<00:05:29.820> root<00:05:30.000> notes<00:05:30.180> to<00:05:30.360> create<00:05:30.600> a
