00:00:06.250 --> 00:00:11.450
 hi dear friends subscribers 

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:12.320
 of my channel with you swords I ran into 

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:15.559
 such a problem 

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:19.279
 my stylish one does not start 

00:00:15.559 --> 00:00:22.190
 the game is purely no game i think that 

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:24.920
 I was banned but it turned out that there is no 

00:00:22.190 --> 00:00:29.450
 Generally I solved this problem rummaged 

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:32.480
 on the internet and now i will show you can 

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:37.699
 be someone and such a problem and I 

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:40.460
 Now all show show first 

00:00:37.699 --> 00:00:43.280
 the first way is to the right 

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:45.620
 check cache integrity here let's say i 

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:46.899
 decided to play counter strike then he 

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:50.319
 did not start 

00:00:46.899 --> 00:00:54.019
 you need to click probably you know all this 

00:00:50.319 --> 00:00:58.059
 need to click the property local files and 

00:00:54.019 --> 00:01:02.809
 check and check our cache it will take 

00:00:58.059 --> 00:01:06.170
 pretty ok time well this one 

00:01:02.809 --> 00:01:09.740
 The method did not help at all once I spent 

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:11.810
 there is not quite a lot of time for me 

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:14.780
 anyway, I think that will help me 

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:15.410
 render just don't understand and second 

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:18.530
 the way 

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:21.980
 Here is the second way I think that's me 

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:25.400
 purely help I think will help you 

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:30.400
 find where you installed your steam 

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:35.600
 here I have it loaded in disk d 

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:38.600
 here and see so many daddies here 

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:42.010
 a lot of butterflies clean all delete 

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:46.000
 all all all all all all except steamapps water 

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:51.220
 cleanly remove everything except steamapps and 

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:53.810
 because you see all the games are loaded and 

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:57.590
 if you remove the incentive at 100 

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:59.900
 not that all the games will fly and what you 

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:03.170
 bought it all go down the drain no 

00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:05.800
 just all the games just fly off your 

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:10.910
 computer and they will not be adopted and 

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:12.980
 so as if too much time if you 

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:15.470
 there is too much time you can 

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:19.610
 Of course remove steamapps but also think 

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:24.250
 nobody needs it and better leave 

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:28.040
 steam abs here we leave steamapps 

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:30.310
 waters and often remove all programs and 

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:32.270
 besides stim, that is, look 

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:36.460
 leave steam 

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:39.710
 steam and steamapps and the rest is clean 

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:43.520
 folders delete all all all delete Zion and 

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:47.570
 no need don't worry i say this 

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:50.050
 truth it helped me through not a word 

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:52.970
 I know why this can be 

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:55.190
 2014 maybe there is something with valve 

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:57.950
 happened well in short I myself do not know what 

00:02:55.190 --> 00:03:04.700
 case maybe it happened before 

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:08.660
 problem yes in general in general not 

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:10.790
 it helped after you delete 

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:13.910
 all files of a folder 

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:16.550
 you still will update steam 

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:22.160
 and then you will need your login and 

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:27.800
 the password will then be updated and then 

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:31.370
 need there your walls will require 

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:33.680
 code from the mail but from your course soap 

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:38.140
 bring out again come in we save 

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:41.000
 rejoice and gram well I think that I helped 

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:42.740
 really i probably helped if you 

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:45.530
 here for the first time you can like 

00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:49.990
 and sign my sword, I hope 

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:49.990
 helped everyone good luck and all bye for now
