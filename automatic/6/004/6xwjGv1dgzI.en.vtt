 someone this will be news

 that the European Union decided on 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:32.820
 classification change in particular 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:36.270

 issues related to the new changes 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:53.539
 classification later we asked him

 classification screw for you voiced yuri 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:16.640
 Ivanovich language going to teach our 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:16.640
 schools on course and on france 

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:26.490
 1935 the French cavalry decided 

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:29.340
 bring the classification of all the best 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:31.350
 winemaking territory features this 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:34.170
 was the first time on this scale and 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:36.270
 so carefully done and this 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:40.190
 the system will later serve as a model 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:43.500
 for many other countries waist spam it 

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:45.420
 such a definition was realized 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:47.970
 orange men control 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:50.270
 what translates as name 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:53.100
 controlled by origin 

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:54.649
 engaged in this classification and the next morning 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:56.910
 there is a state committee 

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:59.869
 paris and state committee 

00:01:56.910 --> 00:02:05.310
 appellations of origin 

00:01:59.869 --> 00:02:08.520
 evaluation criteria were developed based 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:09.989
 on the notion that the product is French 

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:12.930
 the word originated back in the middle ages 

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:16.850
 offer in burgundy and meaning 

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:18.709
 unique combination of soil climate 

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:21.390
 soil and climatic conditions and 

00:02:18.709 --> 00:02:23.580
 Exposure of everything else in a separate 

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:24.890
 wine region or even 

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:27.510
 native and 3 

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:29.700
 this is why these unique 

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:32.190
 natural conditions provide 

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:34.049
 the uniqueness of the wines produced 

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:37.950
 that is, rather, it is certainly not made 

00:02:34.049 --> 00:02:41.940
 blame together then by itself and grapes 

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:43.560
 grown in this product and such 

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:46.769
 grapes together such wine possesses 

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:49.019
 completely unique specific 

00:02:46.769 --> 00:02:53.670
 properties naturally high quality 

00:02:49.019 --> 00:02:55.920
 the authorities were guided by no 

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:58.140
 new wine regions this 

00:02:55.920 --> 00:03:00.630
 the history of this was taken into account 

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:02.190
 the district took into account the grape varieties 

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:04.319
 who became early for this 

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:06.840
 say classic types of wines only 

00:03:04.319 --> 00:03:10.319
 red only white or only 

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:14.489
 fortified wines sparkling wines 

00:03:10.319 --> 00:03:16.040
 and this is all that formed the basis of the system 

00:03:14.489 --> 00:03:18.450
 hotel forces 

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:20.280
 of course have been installed and pretty 

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:22.380
 strict requirements for manufacturers 

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:24.480
 who grow grapes in this 

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:26.910
 the district make it wine but it's in 

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:29.459
 certainly not necessary 

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:32.640
 comply with a number of other requirements of such 

00:03:29.459 --> 00:03:35.450
 how not to exceed the allowable yield 

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:37.530
 enhance certain grape varieties 

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:40.019
 plant a voluminous amount of hair on 

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:41.940
 hectare produce pkio wine two types with 

00:03:40.019 --> 00:03:46.920
 certain alcohol content and the 

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:49.440
 similar later to this system 

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:50.640
 rather, these categories were added and 

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:51.770
 other categories 

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:54.350
 on payments 

00:03:51.770 --> 00:03:58.700
 common years about which we talk a little 

00:03:54.350 --> 00:04:00.950
 later this categories were already taken 

00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:02.540
 for more modest wineries 

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:05.510
 areas but nonetheless highly go there 

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:08.510
 pleasant and as a result you have developed 

00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:09.340
 such a system is 4-stage ie 4 

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:12.020
 categories 

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:14.570
 OS is very portfolio intersecting 

00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:16.000
 over the years it is closed careers reduced 

00:04:14.570 --> 00:04:19.959
