is<00:02:19.170> what<00:02:19.260> does<00:02:19.350> goal<00:02:19.560> is<00:02:19.739> so<00:02:20.579> that's<00:02:20.760> what<00:02:20.910> make

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:21.030 
is what does goal is so that's what make

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:24.110 
is what does goal is so that's what make
the<00:02:21.150> book<00:02:21.660> unique<00:02:22.519> how<00:02:23.519> does<00:02:23.669> it<00:02:23.760> make<00:02:23.850> unique

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:24.120 
the book unique how does it make unique

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:25.699 
the book unique how does it make unique
you<00:02:24.329> plan<00:02:24.540> to<00:02:24.720> take<00:02:24.840> over<00:02:25.049> the<00:02:25.199> underground

00:02:25.699 --> 00:02:25.709 
you plan to take over the underground

00:02:25.709 --> 00:02:26.340 
you plan to take over the underground
world<00:02:25.919> for

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:26.350 
world for

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:28.650 
world for
and<00:02:26.620> then<00:02:27.220> hopefully<00:02:27.400> the<00:02:27.580> world<00:02:27.820> itself<00:02:28.240> is

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:28.660 
and then hopefully the world itself is

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:31.260 
and then hopefully the world itself is
also<00:02:29.020> very<00:02:29.140> greedy<00:02:29.580> so<00:02:30.580> this<00:02:30.700> is<00:02:30.820> just<00:02:30.970> plan

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:31.270 
also very greedy so this is just plan

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:33.150 
also very greedy so this is just plan
that's<00:02:31.840> why<00:02:31.990> it's<00:02:32.170> unique<00:02:32.470> that's<00:02:32.950> why<00:02:33.100> this

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:33.160 
that's why it's unique that's why this

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:35.400 
that's why it's unique that's why this
is<00:02:33.400> a<00:02:33.430> great<00:02:33.670> book<00:02:33.700> that's<00:02:34.660> why<00:02:34.840> Artemis<00:02:35.230> Fowl

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:35.410 
is a great book that's why Artemis Fowl

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:38.370

falls into the gradebook category the

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:41.160 
falls into the gradebook category the
last<00:02:38.590> reason<00:02:38.800> is<00:02:39.100> writing<00:02:39.520> the<00:02:39.900> way<00:02:40.900> the<00:02:41.020> book

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:41.170 
last reason is writing the way the book

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:43.650 
last reason is writing the way the book
is<00:02:41.320> written<00:02:41.760> also<00:02:42.760> makes<00:02:42.970> Artemis<00:02:43.450> Fowl<00:02:43.630> a

sentence<00:05:23.380> which<00:05:24.380> comes<00:05:24.620> from<00:05:24.770> here<00:05:25.130> and<00:05:26.650> this

00:05:27.640 --> 00:05:27.650 
sentence which comes from here and this

00:05:27.650 --> 00:05:35.980 
sentence which comes from here and this
is<00:05:27.710> an<00:05:27.920> opening<00:05:31.660> this<00:05:32.660> is<00:05:32.840> a<00:05:32.870> closing<00:05:33.410> and<00:05:34.990> this
