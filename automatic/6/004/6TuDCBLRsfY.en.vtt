going to be the outer chamber okay
we<00:00:10.320> got<00:00:10.500> our<00:00:10.620> paper<00:00:10.980> template<00:00:11.550> made<00:00:11.849> all<00:00:12.300> taped

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:12.690 
we got our paper template made all taped

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:15.499 
we got our paper template made all taped
on<00:00:13.009> we<00:00:14.009> come<00:00:14.219> up<00:00:14.340> here<00:00:14.370> we're<00:00:14.610> going<00:00:14.700> to<00:00:14.759> 37

on we come up here we're going to 37

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:18.590 
on we come up here we're going to 37
holes<00:00:15.719> because<00:00:16.350> here's<00:00:17.190> where<00:00:17.430> 38<00:00:17.970> inches<00:00:18.359> is

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:18.600 
holes because here's where 38 inches is

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:19.970 
holes because here's where 38 inches is
here's<00:00:18.900> where<00:00:19.109> why<00:00:19.289> we're<00:00:19.529> just<00:00:19.710> going<00:00:19.890> to

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:19.980 
here's where why we're just going to

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:21.470 
here's where why we're just going to
split<00:00:20.160> it<00:00:20.310> to<00:00:20.490> the<00:00:20.580> hole<00:00:20.730> in<00:00:20.939> the<00:00:21.060> middle

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:21.480 
split it to the hole in the middle

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:25.099 
split it to the hole in the middle
this<00:00:21.660> ain't<00:00:21.930> rocket<00:00:22.380> science<00:00:23.240> so<00:00:24.240> Google<00:00:24.960> draw

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:25.109 
this ain't rocket science so Google draw

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:27.140 
this ain't rocket science so Google draw
a<00:00:25.140> sharpie<00:00:25.590> lying<00:00:25.800> around<00:00:25.920> here<00:00:26.220> first<00:00:26.789> in

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:27.150 
a sharpie lying around here first in

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:29.120 
a sharpie lying around here first in
case<00:00:27.390> we<00:00:27.570> lose<00:00:27.720> the<00:00:27.930> paper<00:00:28.170> for<00:00:28.529> some<00:00:28.710> reason

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:29.130 
case we lose the paper for some reason

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:32.200 
case we lose the paper for some reason
and<00:00:29.490> we'll<00:00:30.179> mark<00:00:30.420> our<00:00:30.630> little<00:00:30.900> lines<00:00:31.590> on<00:00:31.920> there

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:32.210 
and we'll mark our little lines on there

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:35.150 
and we'll mark our little lines on there
we're<00:00:33.210> going<00:00:33.329> to<00:00:33.390> Center<00:00:33.660> punch<00:00:33.930> where<00:00:34.890> keep

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:35.160 
we're going to Center punch where keep

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:39.680 
we're going to Center punch where keep
the<00:00:35.309> hole<00:00:35.489> just<00:00:36.000> up<00:00:36.239> above<00:00:37.820> the<00:00:38.820> curve<00:00:39.120> we

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690 
the hole just up above the curve we

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:41.450 
the hole just up above the curve we
don't<00:00:39.840> want<00:00:39.960> to<00:00:40.020> be<00:00:40.110> down<00:00:40.260> here<00:00:40.620> so<00:00:41.190> that<00:00:41.219> on

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
don't want to be down here so that on

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:44.500 
don't want to be down here so that on
ashes<00:00:42.030> would<00:00:42.239> be<00:00:42.390> falling<00:00:42.660> down<00:00:42.960> in<00:00:43.140> here<00:00:43.530> so

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:44.510 
ashes would be falling down in here so

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:47.360 
ashes would be falling down in here so
these<00:00:45.510> may<00:00:45.930> be<00:00:45.989> one-inch<00:00:46.590> don't<00:00:46.950> quote<00:00:47.160> me

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.370 
these may be one-inch don't quote me

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:48.979 
these may be one-inch don't quote me
it's<00:00:47.700> going<00:00:47.940> to<00:00:48.000> be<00:00:48.120> whatever<00:00:48.300> looks<00:00:48.870> good

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
it's going to be whatever looks good

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:50.690 
it's going to be whatever looks good
well<00:00:49.739> it<00:00:49.950> can't<00:00:50.160> you<00:00:50.309> want<00:00:50.460> to<00:00:50.579> etch

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:50.700 
well it can't you want to etch

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:52.939 
well it can't you want to etch
correction<00:00:51.360> it's<00:00:52.020> only<00:00:52.199> one-inch<00:00:52.469> here<00:00:52.770> so

00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:52.949 
correction it's only one-inch here so

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:55.250 
correction it's only one-inch here so
you<00:00:53.010> can<00:00:53.129> only<00:00:53.280> be<00:00:53.460> like<00:00:53.640> 3/4<00:00:54.510> that<00:00:54.899> give<00:00:55.170> you

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
you can only be like 3/4 that give you

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:57.319 
you can only be like 3/4 that give you
half<00:00:55.500> inch<00:00:55.710> spacing<00:00:56.039> so<00:00:56.430> it<00:00:57.030> will<00:00:57.180> not<00:00:57.270> be

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
half inch spacing so it will not be

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:01.490 
half inch spacing so it will not be
better<00:00:57.780> than<00:00:58.109> 3/4<00:00:59.210> so<00:01:00.210> glad<00:01:00.930> we<00:01:01.079> corrected

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
better than 3/4 so glad we corrected

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:05.780 
better than 3/4 so glad we corrected
that<00:01:01.649> right<00:01:01.890> away<00:01:04.309> doctor<00:01:05.309> I'll<00:01:05.400> write<00:01:05.640> it

that's<00:01:18.940> a<00:01:19.030> lot<00:01:19.120> of<00:01:19.270> holes<00:01:19.450> took<00:01:20.380> up<00:01:20.620> pictures

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:21.010 
that's a lot of holes took up pictures

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:25.070 
that's a lot of holes took up pictures
of<00:01:21.130> do<00:01:21.340> it<00:01:21.490> that's<00:01:21.790> a<00:01:21.850> lot<00:01:21.940> of<00:01:21.970> hold<00:01:22.210> up<00:01:22.420> lot<00:01:22.630> air

no.12<00:01:26.080> big<00:01:26.380> holes<00:01:26.650> we<00:01:26.830> don't<00:01:26.980> want<00:01:27.160> it<00:01:27.280> the<00:01:27.460> ash

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:27.640 
no.12 big holes we don't want it the ash

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:29.100 
no.12 big holes we don't want it the ash
is<00:01:27.910> coming<00:01:27.940> out<00:01:28.300> because<00:01:28.390> the<00:01:28.630> ashes<00:01:28.990> are

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:29.110 
is coming out because the ashes are

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:30.900 
is coming out because the ashes are
going<00:01:29.230> to<00:01:29.290> collectiveness<00:01:29.860> if<00:01:30.400> they<00:01:30.640> fall

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:30.910 
going to collectiveness if they fall

00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:34.350 
going to collectiveness if they fall
through<00:01:30.940> anywhere<00:01:31.660> they<00:01:31.930> will<00:01:32.080> be<00:01:32.910> down<00:01:33.910> below

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:34.360 
through anywhere they will be down below

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:38.580 
through anywhere they will be down below
the<00:01:34.630> holes<00:01:34.840> where<00:01:35.650> curves<00:01:37.440> that's<00:01:38.440> we're

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:38.590 
the holes where curves that's we're

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:42.780 
the holes where curves that's we're
going<00:01:38.680> to<00:01:38.770> test<00:01:39.040> it<00:01:39.220> out<00:01:39.340> so<00:01:41.460> this<00:01:42.460> concludes

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:42.790 
going to test it out so this concludes

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:48.910 
going to test it out so this concludes
part<00:01:43.570> two

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:48.920 

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:52.270

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:52.280 
next one will be a test burn we have to

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:54.520 
next one will be a test burn we have to
tack<00:01:52.520> weld<00:01:52.880> that<00:01:53.090> top<00:01:53.630> ring<00:01:53.930> on<00:01:54.110> the<00:01:54.260> part

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:54.530

tack weld that top ring on the part
throw<00:01:54.980> it<00:01:55.070> in<00:01:55.160> there<00:01:55.340> and<00:01:55.460> do<00:01:55.550> a<00:01:55.580> test<00:01:55.880> for

00:01:56.050 --> 00:01:56.060 
throw it in there and do a test for

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:57.970 
throw it in there and do a test for
we're<00:01:56.630> going<00:01:56.780> to<00:01:56.840> use<00:01:56.960> the<00:01:57.080> 2x4<00:01:57.680> down<00:01:57.860> to

00:01:57.970 --> 00:01:57.980 
we're going to use the 2x4 down to

00:01:57.980 --> 00:02:00.280 
we're going to use the 2x4 down to
bottom<00:01:58.280> just<00:01:58.370> a<00:01:58.550> spacer<00:01:59.030> it<00:01:59.120> we<00:01:59.930> don't<00:02:00.020> care<00:02:00.140> if

bottom just a spacer it we don't care if

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:03.370 
bottom just a spacer it we don't care if
it<00:02:00.380> catches<00:02:00.530> on<00:02:00.800> fire<00:02:01.570> and<00:02:02.570> we'll<00:02:03.020> do<00:02:03.110> a<00:02:03.140> test

it catches on fire and we'll do a test

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:04.780 
it catches on fire and we'll do a test
burn<00:02:03.650> a<00:02:03.710> little<00:02:03.920> bit<00:02:04.130> of<00:02:04.220> wood<00:02:04.370> see<00:02:04.670> what

burn a little bit of wood see what

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:06.220 
burn a little bit of wood see what
happens<00:02:05.150> I<00:02:05.330> know<00:02:05.510> it's<00:02:05.750> going<00:02:05.840> to<00:02:05.900> be<00:02:05.960> messy

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:06.230 
happens I know it's going to be messy
