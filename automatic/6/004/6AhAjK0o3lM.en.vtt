00:00:01.310 --> 00:00:06.710
 here is how recovery usually looks like 

00:00:08.630 --> 00:00:16.020
 but the benefit is still in English 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:22.230
 But there is a Chinese recovery that is here 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:30.060

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:40.670
 recovery 

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:44.480

00:00:52.129 --> 00:00:59.360
 directly further we need 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:02.910
 to set 

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:06.979
 debugging is not avoided as it exposes 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:06.979
 go to the menu for developers 

00:01:07.759 --> 00:01:18.149
 put a tick near the tent yusbi 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:20.820
 We agree on all the Chinese are put 

00:01:18.149 --> 00:01:29.149
 totally different well I think with this you 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:31.830
 we will not experience them and so it means from this 

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:37.710
 File history 

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:41.310

00:01:54.750 --> 00:02:02.969
 we are standing sometimes when he is not here 

00:01:58.759 --> 00:02:06.659
 there is a separate little button with root 

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:11.100
 white breast if Ruth does not work as well in 

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:14.190
 we need something here or somewhere 

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:17.640
 There is a video or links in the description 

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:20.190
 see how to make the root further after 

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:23.040
 how we set root if it is not 

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:29.840
 Click on this tab here root backup 

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:33.000
 &amp; recovery here in this menu we choose 

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:38.359
 second point use but from

 phone and click recovery and boot 

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:44.700
 Agree with what the cvm will do 

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:47.349
 recovery 

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:47.920
 automatically that is, we need to be wise and 

00:02:47.349 --> 00:02:56.950
 kaveri 

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:59.349
 Yes, then the case of brick will have 

00:02:56.950 --> 00:03:01.780
 flash this file via flash tool 

00:02:59.349 --> 00:03:05.280
 try to install patched boot 

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:05.280
 phone click yes 

00:03:08.129 --> 00:03:18.069
 install the created erecovery phone 

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:21.780
 agree in the right corner we see everything 

00:03:18.069 --> 00:03:24.370
 these movements are being made 

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:26.790
 reboot phone in recovery mode 

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:29.969
 we can basically do it now 

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:29.969
 let's do 

00:03:37.270 --> 00:03:46.960
 there 

00:03:38.770 --> 00:03:47.440
 the phone has rebooted and now now 

00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:50.250
 my 

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:50.250
 unhooked 

00:03:52.110 --> 00:04:02.180
 and how you eat truth upside down 

00:03:56.310 --> 00:04:05.790
 kicking but it's tsivy and 

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:10.080
 recovery through which driving buttons 

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:13.700
 In this case, three Zion contrary 

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:17.340
 happens we can install patches 

00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:19.440
 do wipe and but most importantly we 

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:25.250
 we can install 

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:28.970
 and zip zip archives with custom firmware 

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:31.620
 with official in general with any 

00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:34.460
 finger and so on fixes gaps then 

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:37.650
 there is anything you can already 

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:41.280
 put through this menu throwing on 

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:44.070
 flash drive and so on but here again in principle 

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:46.860
 everything is standard everything in english 

00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:48.950
 that is, for those who have a recovery menu 

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:53.690
 In general, in Chinese it is the most convenient 

00:04:48.950 --> 00:04:57.540
 option so use 

00:04:53.690 --> 00:05:00.150
