00:00:13.210 --> 00:00:19.430
 it is about we will need for the 

00:00:15.830 --> 00:00:22.630
 sponge cake 3 eggs a natural yogurt a 

00:00:19.430 --> 00:00:26.210
 About yeast 200 grams of flour 

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:28.880
 200 grams of sugar and a glass of yogurt 

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:31.489
 of oil for the filling we will need 

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:32.809
 half a liter of cream and 250 grams of 

00:00:31.489 --> 00:00:34.430
 chocolate coverage 

00:00:32.809 --> 00:00:36.019
 we started putting melting the 

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:38.239
 chocolate for this we put to heat 

00:00:36.019 --> 00:00:40.760
 a little water and when it boils we turn off 

00:00:38.239 --> 00:00:43.100
 and we place the chocolate when it starts 

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:45.260
 to melt we give a few laps to 

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:47.059
 that is done by all the same good our 

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:49.339
 chocolate is already melted and now what 

00:00:47.059 --> 00:00:51.770
 we do is remove it and let it cool 

00:00:49.339 --> 00:00:54.230
 to then mix with the cream 

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:56.390
 we are going to prepare cream it is important that 

00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:58.460
 be both the cream and the container 

00:00:56.390 --> 00:01:01.820
 quite cold and remember that the cream 

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:04.120
 it must be 35% more nothing special for 

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:04.120
 mount 

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:12.149
 I start to get consistency cream 

00:01:09.929 --> 00:01:14.249
 we throw the sugar 4 tablespoons would be 

00:01:12.149 --> 00:01:18.170
 enough though each one does it to his 

00:01:14.249 --> 00:01:18.170
 taste and we just increase the welcome 

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:25.899
 and it really gets cold in our 

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:28.180
 chocolate we reserve the whipped cream 

00:01:25.899 --> 00:01:30.490
 the fridge and we start with the sponge cake 

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:33.220
 that we started putting in regulation 

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:34.180
 the oven at 180 degrees and we're going to prepare 

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:36.100
 our mold 

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:39.009
 We are going to use a removable mold of 22 

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:41.610
 centimeters but we put paper bake 

00:01:39.009 --> 00:01:41.610
 over the top 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:45.570
 and cut the ends 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:54.840
 we have a little margarine or 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:56.429
 butter the sides 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:59.149
 is strong in the necessary because 

00:01:56.429 --> 00:01:59.149
 we have our paper 

00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:04.370
 a finite layer 

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:06.550
 and with a little flour we are going 

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:08.620
 all over the side 

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:12.730
 if we go to the leftover line and 

00:02:08.620 --> 00:02:16.500
 we observe we start throwing the three 

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:16.500
 eggs and we begin to see 

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:27.370
 as soon as they make the foam we throw the joe 

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:27.370
 we use the yogurt of about 125 grams 

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:33.610
 assets 

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:43.790
 and we add the sugar 200 grams that 

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:45.710
 are equivalent to filling the container twice 

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:48.130
 de jong let's make the sugar and 

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:48.130
 stirring 

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:06.130
 next he called the flour and royal 

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:08.500
 we throw everything in the same container 

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:10.630
 and we will sift if you do not have a 

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:12.340
 filmmaker can do with it 

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:14.790
 strainer the objective is not to take 

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:18.060
 too many lumps 

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:21.720
 let's go throwing a quantity first 

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:21.720
 if we are stirring 

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:28.700
 we continue with the rest 

00:03:39.569 --> 00:03:43.230
 today we have it we will cry in the 

00:03:41.579 --> 00:03:45.430
 theme to be shown liberdade country or 

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:47.560
 we use the yogurt container 

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:50.079
 and we throw olive oil or oil 

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:53.330
 sunflower we put practically full 

00:03:50.079 --> 00:03:56.200
 about 100 milliliters half a glass 

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:56.200
 and we remove 

00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:04.160
 and here we would have seen it now what 

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:08.770
 we have in our furniture and bake 

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:08.770
 we bake at 180 degrees about 40 minutes 

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:15.770
 45 minutes before we click to 

00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:15.770
 check 

00:04:17.489 --> 00:04:21.169
 and here we have our cake 

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:28.210
 and we unmold 

00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:29.620
 once we open you carefully 

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:32.729
 and here we would have our cake 

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:35.319
 prepared as you see is at its point 

00:04:32.729 --> 00:04:37.539
 let's prepare the truffle for it 

00:04:35.319 --> 00:04:39.759
 we are going to use the cream that we assemble and the 

00:04:37.539 --> 00:04:43.090
 melted chocolate and as you can see it 's cold 

00:04:39.759 --> 00:04:44.860
 you see that it is thick 

00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:48.310
 and let's reserve a little cream 

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:51.389
 first that is going to be the external base of 

00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:55.150
 our decoration more or less as well as 

00:04:51.389 --> 00:05:00.060
 a cup and now in the remaining cream 

00:04:55.150 --> 00:05:00.060
 let's mix our chocolate 

00:05:02.569 --> 00:05:07.899
 and the next step is with the rods 

00:05:04.429 --> 00:05:07.899
 you just released 

00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:13.820
 and here we would have it 

00:05:11.630 --> 00:05:14.720
 well we have our cold letter and 

00:05:13.820 --> 00:05:16.490
 now what are we going to do that 

00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:17.000
 fill it up for them with the help of a 

00:05:16.490 --> 00:05:18.660
 knife 

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:21.860
 let's go cutting now 

00:05:18.660 --> 00:05:21.860
 let's cut in half 

00:05:22.330 --> 00:05:25.050
 we are turning 

00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:28.060
 and now 

00:05:28.210 --> 00:05:33.139
 carefully 

00:05:30.150 --> 00:05:34.879
 remove the top cover 

00:05:33.139 --> 00:05:36.500
 for our next step is going to be 

00:05:34.879 --> 00:05:39.290
 half war 

00:05:36.500 --> 00:05:41.480
 We pick up this truffle and we go attending 

00:05:39.290 --> 00:05:43.930
 a uniform layer we could also 

00:05:41.480 --> 00:05:45.910
 do it with a baker 

00:05:43.930 --> 00:05:47.409
 and now we come back to this vine with 

00:05:45.910 --> 00:05:49.749
 watch out 

00:05:47.409 --> 00:05:51.519
 we distribute all the cream and now the 

00:05:49.749 --> 00:05:53.830
 next step will be decorate it with the 

00:05:51.519 --> 00:05:55.979
 chocolate let's fill our sleeve 

00:05:53.830 --> 00:05:55.979
 pastry 

00:05:56.360 --> 00:06:00.550
 an account we will remove the excess 

00:05:58.340 --> 00:06:00.550
 air 

00:06:00.710 --> 00:06:04.180
 and we start with this decoration 

00:06:17.240 --> 00:06:22.100
 good since we already have 

00:06:20.210 --> 00:06:23.960

00:06:22.100 --> 00:06:25.759
