00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.410
 in the swamp business the first sacrifices on Thursday 

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:06.930
 Dutch Rotterdam has committed suicide 

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:09.360
 Alexander Dolmatov Physics scientist who 

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:11.010
 In the summer, an activist fled from Russia Dolmat 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:13.200
 opposition party other Russia 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:15.719
 feared arrest on charges of organizing 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:17.400
 riots in the marsh area in 

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:19.740
 the netherlands he asked for political 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:22.380
 asylum but in granting status 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:24.300
 refugee denied him Dolmatov filed 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:27.029
 appeal but not waiting for a decision 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:29.010
 committed suicide not all allies 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:31.230
 Dolmatov believe in what he did away with 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:32.640
 after all, in Russia dolmats despite 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:34.980
 youth was the lead designer 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:37.320
 one of the defense enterprises and myself 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:38.989
 repeatedly talked about spying 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:41.219
 there was also a suicide note 

00:00:38.989 --> 00:00:43.800
 the opposition who only more 

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:47.969
 all confused to go to this step I think 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:50.520
 it is necessary as a last resort your country better 

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:52.620
 still try not to leave the past 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:54.960
 autumn we filmed both ran lives 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:57.210
 oppositionist in holland there him right away 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:59.520
 issued documents of candidates refugees 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:01.649
 provided this housing and even 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:04.320
 paid for medical insurance and 

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:06.570
 weekly translated benefits but 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:08.850
 as a result, the Dutch authorities unexpectedly decided 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:10.790
 refuse Russian refugees in 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:13.860
 political asylum 

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:15.240
 Dolmatov participated in the opposition rally 6 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:17.580
 May in the swamp area 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:22.130
 but he said that he felt for a long time 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:22.130
 spying on politics 

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:48.170
 they are constantly technical information 

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:51.020
 never mom alexander dolmatova 

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:54.680
 ask the authorities and the Netherlands and Russia 

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:57.080
 attention spelling out son's death 

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:59.990
 the official version of suicide she is not 

00:01:57.080 --> 00:02:03.140
 believes it looks like a massacre 

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:05.869
 this is a massacre almost 2 weeks before death 

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:08.720
 close lost contact with alexander his 

00:02:05.869 --> 00:02:11.269
 transferred to deportation prison and from there 

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:13.310
 should have been sent back to Russia 

00:02:11.269 --> 00:02:14.959
 but the lawyer did not even know about it 

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:17.720
 Dolmatova who claims that 

00:02:14.959 --> 00:02:19.910
 Alexander himself before the transfer to prison 

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:22.160
 stopped answering calls and generally 

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:25.370
 somehow changed a lot 

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:29.480
 closed to me here someone called and 

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:29.840
 said here there is a letter or a note means 

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:33.019
 this 

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:35.239
 This is already in Holland so interpreted that here 

00:02:33.019 --> 00:02:37.519
 it's not related to them on friday 

00:02:35.239 --> 00:02:39.739
 the Internet was published deathbed 

00:02:37.519 --> 00:02:42.079
 Dalmatian letter but this text is only 

00:02:39.739 --> 00:02:44.239
 more confusing in this 

00:02:42.079 --> 00:02:46.430
 note dolmatov addressing mom 

00:02:44.239 --> 00:02:49.430
 says he doesn't want to come back 

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:51.910
 traitor and disgrace your whole mouth this 

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:54.890
 quote still writes that life in Russia 

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:56.900
 better than anywhere else content 

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:58.850
 notes caused a lot of questions at the 

00:02:56.900 --> 00:03:01.100
 alexander friends alone now 

00:02:58.850 --> 00:03:03.140
 tell that promising physics 

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:04.519
 as if inclined to cooperate 

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:07.130
 the authorities of the Netherlands 

00:03:04.519 --> 00:03:08.989
 here almost others were recruited 

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:09.859
 that did not notice the Russian 

00:03:08.989 --> 00:03:12.410
 oppositionist 

00:03:09.859 --> 00:03:14.930
 no signs of depression though power 

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:17.630
 Galadze argue that dolmatov centers 

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:18.049
 for refugees twice tried to do away with 

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:20.359
 by myself 

00:03:18.049 --> 00:03:22.880
 here it is not about some 

00:03:20.359 --> 00:03:24.530
 voluntary life care nobody 

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:27.440
 noticed no concern or 

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:30.829
 some experiences there in his soul 

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:33.709
 but I do not exclude the version that it is direct 

00:03:30.829 --> 00:03:35.569
 revenge here by the way is also a mystery if 

00:03:33.709 --> 00:03:37.190
 true that dolmatov several times 

00:03:35.569 --> 00:03:38.900
 tried to commit suicide 

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:41.720
 why after the first attempt of suicide 

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:43.880
 he was not taken to the hospital but tried 

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:46.100
 only urgently to deport to Russia 

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:48.740
 Now, human rights activists are asked to understand 

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:51.470
 in this case the Parliament of the Netherlands 

00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:54.350
 Obama Dolmatova talks about the problems 

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:56.770
 with special services here at home after 

00:03:54.350 --> 00:03:59.270
 each meeting to go to his work 

00:03:56.770 --> 00:04:02.540
 the message is that such and such is yours 

00:03:59.270 --> 00:04:05.590
 the employee was at a rally deal 

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:07.970
 why do we have that person 

00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:12.500
 who went to the rally 

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:14.540
 he is already known and good and the death of his son 

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:16.430
 mother Alexander Dolmatova learned from 

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:19.040
 press they are from officials 

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:21.350
 netherlands or russia dolmatov himself in 

00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:21.950
 emigration talked a lot about nostalgia for 

00:04:21.350 --> 00:04:24.080
 homeland 

00:04:21.950 --> 00:04:26.750
 more about the inconvenience 

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:28.490
 due to escaping from the country and others 

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:31.270
 accused in a marsh case 

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:31.270
 are in prison
