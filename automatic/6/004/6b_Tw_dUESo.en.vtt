00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:06.690 
make a video about how to find a good

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:12.350 
make a video about how to find a good
ground<00:00:07.970> so<00:00:10.700> I'm<00:00:11.700> going<00:00:11.880> to<00:00:11.910> teach<00:00:12.120> you<00:00:12.300> guys

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:12.360 
ground so I'm going to teach you guys

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:19.029 
ground so I'm going to teach you guys
how<00:00:12.509> to<00:00:12.719> find<00:00:12.990> a<00:00:13.080> good<00:00:13.200> ground<00:00:13.559> right<00:00:13.860> now

00:00:19.029 --> 00:00:19.039 

00:00:19.039 --> 00:00:25.070 

first<00:00:20.039> off<00:00:21.050> let<00:00:22.050> me<00:00:22.080> show<00:00:22.410> you<00:00:22.830> that<00:00:23.100> I<00:00:24.080> made

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:25.080 
first off let me show you that I made

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:28.250 
first off let me show you that I made
the<00:00:25.199> trunk<00:00:25.470> a<00:00:25.560> little<00:00:25.670> bit<00:00:26.670> nicer<00:00:27.080> there's<00:00:28.080> all

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:28.260 
the trunk a little bit nicer there's all

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:31.130 
the trunk a little bit nicer there's all
the<00:00:28.380> rungs<00:00:28.590> from<00:00:28.859> the<00:00:28.949> alternator<00:00:29.369> I<00:00:30.140> put

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:31.140 
the rungs from the alternator I put

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:33.530 
the rungs from the alternator I put
another<00:00:31.380> ground<00:00:31.740> on<00:00:31.949> each<00:00:32.099> battery<00:00:32.550> so

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:33.540 
another ground on each battery so

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:38.569 
another ground on each battery so
there's<00:00:33.750> three<00:00:34.110> on<00:00:34.320> each<00:00:34.469> battery<00:00:35.750> none<00:00:37.579> all

00:00:38.569 --> 00:00:38.579 
there's three on each battery none all

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:48.709 
there's three on each battery none all
this<00:00:43.730> so<00:00:44.730> I<00:00:46.670> had<00:00:47.670> a<00:00:47.700> shitload<00:00:48.059> of<00:00:48.210> 4<00:00:48.510> gauge

00:00:48.709 --> 00:00:48.719 
this so I had a shitload of 4 gauge

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:50.510 
this so I had a shitload of 4 gauge
laying<00:00:49.020> around<00:00:49.170> so<00:00:49.559> that's<00:00:49.680> why<00:00:49.890> everything<00:00:50.280> I

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:50.520 
laying around so that's why everything I

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:56.029 
laying around so that's why everything I
did<00:00:51.059> yesterday<00:00:52.129> is<00:00:53.129> in<00:00:53.280> 4<00:00:53.489> gauge<00:00:54.949> actually<00:00:55.949> I'm

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039 
did yesterday is in 4 gauge actually I'm

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:59.299 
did yesterday is in 4 gauge actually I'm
just<00:00:56.100> gonna<00:00:56.460> need<00:00:56.670> this<00:00:56.820> up<00:00:57.680> ok<00:00:58.680> so<00:00:59.219> what

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
just gonna need this up ok so what

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:00.950 
just gonna need this up ok so what
you're<00:00:59.370> going<00:00:59.520> to<00:00:59.579> need<00:00:59.760> to<00:01:00.510> find<00:01:00.690> a<00:01:00.809> good

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 
you're going to need to find a good

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:04.789 
you're going to need to find a good
ground<00:01:01.230> is<00:01:01.859> a<00:01:02.010> digital<00:01:02.430> multimeter<00:01:02.760> I<00:01:03.799> don't

00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:04.799 
ground is a digital multimeter I don't

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:06.310 
ground is a digital multimeter I don't
actually<00:01:04.979> have<00:01:05.220> to<00:01:05.309> take<00:01:05.430> that<00:01:05.760> back<00:01:05.909> up

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:06.320 
actually have to take that back up

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:08.810 
actually have to take that back up
you're<00:01:07.320> going<00:01:07.409> to<00:01:07.470> need<00:01:07.590> a<00:01:08.040> digital

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820 
you're going to need a digital

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:15.550 
you're going to need a digital
multimeter<00:01:10.939> and<00:01:11.939> that's<00:01:12.720> it

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:15.560 

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:18.800 

so<00:01:16.560> what<00:01:17.280> you're<00:01:17.400> going<00:01:17.520> to<00:01:17.610> do<00:01:17.850> is<00:01:18.180> you're

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
so what you're going to do is you're

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:21.590 
so what you're going to do is you're
going<00:01:18.840> to<00:01:18.990> perform<00:01:19.350> a<00:01:19.530> voltage<00:01:19.979> drop<00:01:20.189> test<00:01:20.670> on

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600 
going to perform a voltage drop test on

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:24.560 
going to perform a voltage drop test on
your<00:01:22.080> battery<00:01:22.670> not<00:01:23.670> even<00:01:23.939> on<00:01:24.030> the<00:01:24.119> battery<00:01:24.450> on

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 
your battery not even on the battery on

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:26.590 
your battery not even on the battery on
the<00:01:24.659> ground<00:01:24.900> side<00:01:25.590> circuit<00:01:26.040> of<00:01:26.130> your<00:01:26.250> saw

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:26.600 
the ground side circuit of your saw

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:29.630 
the ground side circuit of your saw
system<00:01:27.600> so<00:01:28.320> what<00:01:28.439> you<00:01:28.500> want<00:01:28.680> to<00:01:28.740> do<00:01:28.890> go<00:01:29.430> ahead

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
system so what you want to do go ahead

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:34.490 
system so what you want to do go ahead
and<00:01:29.759> set<00:01:29.939> it<00:01:29.970> to<00:01:30.150> DC<00:01:30.420> volts<00:01:32.180> then<00:01:33.180> on<00:01:33.630> mine<00:01:33.960> I've

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
and set it to DC volts then on mine I've

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:37.850 
and set it to DC volts then on mine I've
the<00:01:34.799> alligator<00:01:35.250> clamps<00:01:35.670> on<00:01:35.820> it<00:01:36.000> so<00:01:36.810> so<00:01:37.710> it'll

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
the alligator clamps on it so so it'll

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:44.090 
the alligator clamps on it so so it'll
be<00:01:37.950> easier<00:01:38.490> on<00:01:39.619> me<00:01:41.180> we<00:01:42.180> put<00:01:43.020> you're<00:01:43.890> going<00:01:44.040> to

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100 
be easier on me we put you're going to

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:47.359 
be easier on me we put you're going to
take<00:01:44.430> one<00:01:44.670> lead<00:01:45.560> put<00:01:46.560> it<00:01:46.649> on<00:01:46.770> the<00:01:46.950> negative

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:47.369 
take one lead put it on the negative

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:50.899 
take one lead put it on the negative
terminal<00:01:47.820> of<00:01:48.750> your<00:01:48.990> battery<00:01:49.610> take<00:01:50.610> the<00:01:50.759> other

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:50.909 
terminal of your battery take the other

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:53.389 
terminal of your battery take the other
lead<00:01:51.180> and<00:01:51.479> then<00:01:52.380> put<00:01:52.649> it<00:01:52.740> on<00:01:52.829> your<00:01:52.890> ground

00:01:53.389 --> 00:01:53.399 
lead and then put it on your ground

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:57.289 
lead and then put it on your ground
mines<00:01:54.329> right<00:01:54.570> there<00:01:54.979> you<00:01:55.979> do<00:01:56.310> not<00:01:56.549> want<00:01:57.060> to<00:01:57.149> see

00:01:57.289 --> 00:01:57.299 
mines right there you do not want to see

00:01:57.299 --> 00:02:01.940 
mines right there you do not want to see
more<00:01:57.509> than<00:01:57.719> point<00:01:58.110> two<00:01:58.500> on<00:01:58.860> your<00:01:59.369> DMM<00:01:59.930> so<00:02:00.950> I'm

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:01.950 
more than point two on your DMM so I'm

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:03.170 
more than point two on your DMM so I'm
going<00:02:02.100> to<00:02:02.189> put<00:02:02.340> that<00:02:02.549> down<00:02:02.759> there<00:02:02.820> on<00:02:03.119> the

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:03.180 
going to put that down there on the

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:09.410 
going to put that down there on the
ground

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:09.420 

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:12.420 

perfect<00:02:10.420> that's<00:02:11.319> a<00:02:11.500> great<00:02:11.800> ground<00:02:12.220> right

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:12.430 
perfect that's a great ground right

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:18.030 
perfect that's a great ground right
there<00:02:15.360> alright<00:02:16.360> and<00:02:16.569> now<00:02:17.260> I'm<00:02:17.680> going<00:02:17.800> to<00:02:17.890> show

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:18.040 
there alright and now I'm going to show

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:20.940 
there alright and now I'm going to show
you<00:02:18.099> on<00:02:18.340> my<00:02:18.370> other<00:02:18.580> ground<00:02:18.970> which<00:02:19.720> is<00:02:19.950> back

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:20.950 
you on my other ground which is back

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:30.809 
you on my other ground which is back
here<00:02:21.989> put<00:02:22.989> it<00:02:23.140> on<00:02:23.680> there<00:02:29.190> and<00:02:30.190> that's<00:02:30.489> a<00:02:30.670> good

00:02:30.809 --> 00:02:30.819 
here put it on there and that's a good

00:02:30.819 --> 00:02:34.280 
here put it on there and that's a good
ground<00:02:31.180> too

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:34.290 

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:36.470 

so<00:02:35.290> that's<00:02:35.440> it

so that's it

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:40.290 
so that's it
that's<00:02:37.480> how<00:02:37.630> you<00:02:37.690> find<00:02:37.900> a<00:02:38.019> ground
