00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:22.410 
talk about this because pretty much all

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:23.509 
talk about this because pretty much all
of<00:00:22.529> us<00:00:22.619> know<00:00:22.830> that<00:00:22.859> the<00:00:23.100> game<00:00:23.250> is<00:00:23.369> going<00:00:23.460> to

00:00:23.509 --> 00:00:23.519 
of us know that the game is going to

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:25.700 
of us know that the game is going to
come<00:00:23.699> out<00:00:23.730> in<00:00:23.970> November<00:00:24.420> and<00:00:24.630> we<00:00:25.470> think

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:25.710 
come out in November and we think

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:27.410 
come out in November and we think
they're<00:00:25.920> going<00:00:26.010> to<00:00:26.070> be<00:00:26.220> remix<00:00:26.699> or<00:00:27.029> maybe<00:00:27.300> even

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:27.420 
they're going to be remix or maybe even

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:29.540 
they're going to be remix or maybe even
sequels<00:00:28.260> and<00:00:28.500> that's<00:00:28.830> why<00:00:29.039> I'm<00:00:29.130> trying<00:00:29.310> to<00:00:29.460> get

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:29.550 
sequels and that's why I'm trying to get

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:32.420 
sequels and that's why I'm trying to get
here<00:00:29.849> because<00:00:30.830> they<00:00:31.830> might<00:00:32.070> not<00:00:32.279> even

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:32.430 
here because they might not even

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:34.250 
here because they might not even
actually<00:00:32.969> do<00:00:33.149> remake<00:00:33.540> this<00:00:33.719> could<00:00:34.020> be<00:00:34.230> a

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:34.260 
actually do remake this could be a

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:36.380

or even you Nova so does that mean that

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:50.270 
or even you Nova so does that mean that
there's<00:01:47.220> actually<00:01:47.850> a<00:01:47.880> new<00:01:48.270> region<00:01:48.659> and<00:01:49.280> just

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280 
there's actually a new region and just

so happens I Kyogre and growling are
going<00:01:52.530> to<00:01:52.590> be<00:01:52.680> a<00:01:52.710> part<00:01:52.950> of<00:01:52.979> the<00:01:53.100> story<00:01:53.399> again<00:01:53.549> it

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:53.880 
going to be a part of the story again it

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:56.389 
going to be a part of the story again it
looks<00:01:54.570> like<00:01:54.689> in<00:01:55.140> my<00:01:55.439> opinion<00:01:55.799> that<00:01:56.040> this<00:01:56.250> is

00:01:56.389 --> 00:01:56.399 
looks like in my opinion that this is

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:58.520 
looks like in my opinion that this is
going<00:01:56.520> to<00:01:56.610> be<00:01:56.729> some<00:01:57.000> sort<00:01:57.210> of<00:01:57.329> sequel<00:01:57.810> that

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:58.530 
going to be some sort of sequel that

00:01:58.530 --> 00:01:59.840 
going to be some sort of sequel that
probably<00:01:58.890> is<00:01:59.040> going<00:01:59.159> to<00:01:59.250> have<00:01:59.369> a<00:01:59.399> new<00:01:59.579> region

00:01:59.840 --> 00:01:59.850 
probably is going to have a new region

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:01.310 
probably is going to have a new region
whether<00:02:00.180> it's<00:02:00.390> going<00:02:00.540> to<00:02:00.600> have<00:02:00.750> the<00:02:00.869> Oval

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:01.320 
whether it's going to have the Oval

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:04.880 
whether it's going to have the Oval
region<00:02:01.710> or<00:02:01.860> not<00:02:02.159> I<00:02:02.430> am<00:02:03.030> really<00:02:03.780> like<00:02:04.259> just<00:02:04.649> I

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:04.890 
region or not I am really like just I

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:06.530 
region or not I am really like just I
don't<00:02:05.310> know<00:02:05.490> I<00:02:05.549> feel<00:02:05.880> really<00:02:06.180> good<00:02:06.479> about

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:06.540 
don't know I feel really good about

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:08.270 
don't know I feel really good about
there<00:02:06.899> being<00:02:07.020> a<00:02:07.170> new<00:02:07.290> region<00:02:07.530> obviously<00:02:08.099> with

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:41.750 
much else and usually that's kind of

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:43.360 
much else and usually that's kind of

00:02:48.369 --> 00:02:48.379 
black white too but I know with X of why

00:02:48.379 --> 00:02:50.470

00:02:58.839 --> 00:02:58.849 
like we know what sixteen is going to

00:02:58.849 --> 00:03:00.729 
like we know what sixteen is going to
look<00:02:58.970> like<00:02:59.030> in<00:02:59.329> this<00:02:59.569> game<00:02:59.840> obviously<00:03:00.049> we<00:03:00.470> know

00:03:00.729 --> 00:03:00.739 
look like in this game obviously we know

00:03:00.739 --> 00:03:02.199 
look like in this game obviously we know
we<00:03:01.220> have<00:03:01.280> pretty<00:03:01.519> good<00:03:01.639> ideas<00:03:01.939> of<00:03:02.090> how<00:03:02.150> the

00:03:02.199 --> 00:03:02.209 
we have pretty good ideas of how the

00:03:02.209 --> 00:03:03.550 
we have pretty good ideas of how the
graphics<00:03:02.659> are<00:03:02.750> going<00:03:02.900> to<00:03:02.959> look<00:03:03.049> so<00:03:03.109> maybe<00:03:03.409> they

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:03.560 
graphics are going to look so maybe they

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:05.110 
graphics are going to look so maybe they
didn't<00:03:03.829> need<00:03:03.920> as<00:03:04.159> big<00:03:04.459> of<00:03:04.489> an<00:03:04.609> introduction

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:05.120 
didn't need as big of an introduction

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:07.360 
didn't need as big of an introduction
but<00:03:06.079> still<00:03:06.290> it's<00:03:06.560> really<00:03:07.040> interesting

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:07.370 
but still it's really interesting

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:09.580 
but still it's really interesting
because<00:03:07.609> it<00:03:08.000> really<00:03:08.329> just<00:03:08.900> wants<00:03:09.200> to<00:03:09.230> make<00:03:09.319> you

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:09.590 
because it really just wants to make you

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:10.839 
because it really just wants to make you
think<00:03:09.620> that<00:03:09.889> there's<00:03:10.129> going<00:03:10.280> to<00:03:10.370> be<00:03:10.400> a<00:03:10.459> new

00:03:10.839 --> 00:03:10.849 
think that there's going to be a new

00:03:10.849 --> 00:03:13.240 
think that there's going to be a new
region<00:03:11.120> for<00:03:11.420> everyone<00:03:11.750> to<00:03:11.870> explore<00:03:12.260> and<00:03:12.620> keep

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:13.250 
region for everyone to explore and keep

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:15.220 
region for everyone to explore and keep
in<00:03:13.400> mind<00:03:13.609> that<00:03:13.700> ruby<00:03:14.120> sapphire<00:03:14.359> sales<00:03:14.870> weren't

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:15.230 
in mind that ruby sapphire sales weren't

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:16.750 
in mind that ruby sapphire sales weren't
that<00:03:15.500> great<00:03:15.709> and<00:03:16.010> I<00:03:16.069> guess<00:03:16.280> they're<00:03:16.549> now

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:16.760 
that great and I guess they're now

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:18.970 
that great and I guess they're now
trying<00:03:16.819> to<00:03:17.419> just<00:03:17.629> get<00:03:17.810> some<00:03:18.049> new<00:03:18.260> people<00:03:18.650> on

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:18.980 
trying to just get some new people on

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:20.860 
trying to just get some new people on
you<00:03:19.549> know<00:03:19.639> some<00:03:19.879> people<00:03:20.180> who<00:03:20.209> even<00:03:20.660> you<00:03:20.810> know

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:20.870 
you know some people who even you know

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:22.569 
you know some people who even you know
maybe<00:03:21.349> even<00:03:21.590> had<00:03:21.829> played<00:03:22.099> they<00:03:22.129> remake

00:03:22.569 --> 00:03:22.579 
maybe even had played they remake

00:03:22.579 --> 00:03:24.400 
maybe even had played they remake
they're<00:03:23.150> trying<00:03:23.359> to<00:03:23.389> do<00:03:23.569> that<00:03:23.780> and<00:03:23.989> they're

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:24.410 
they're trying to do that and they're

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:26.080 
they're trying to do that and they're
also<00:03:24.530> trying<00:03:24.680> to<00:03:24.919> entice<00:03:25.129> people<00:03:25.430> by<00:03:25.849> saying

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:27.680 
that there's a new region and you know

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:29.439 
that there's a new region and you know
obviously<00:03:27.919> that<00:03:28.310> you<00:03:28.849> should<00:03:29.060> go<00:03:29.150> check<00:03:29.329> this

00:03:29.439 --> 00:03:29.449 
obviously that you should go check this

00:03:29.449 --> 00:03:31.210 
obviously that you should go check this
out<00:03:29.629> because<00:03:29.810> new<00:03:30.109> regions<00:03:30.560> are<00:03:30.709> always<00:03:30.980> fun

00:03:31.210 --> 00:03:31.220 
out because new regions are always fun

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:34.569 
out because new regions are always fun

00:03:34.569 --> 00:03:34.579 
so um that's really interesting and

00:03:34.579 --> 00:03:36.670
