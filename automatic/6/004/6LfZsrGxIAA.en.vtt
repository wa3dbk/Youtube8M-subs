professionally done it was quite

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:30.319

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:32.430

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
hair at the bottom because before this I

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:05.690 
hair at the bottom because before this I
actually<00:01:03.630> had<00:01:03.989> black<00:01:04.379> hair<00:01:04.409> darker<00:01:05.369> than<00:01:05.519> my

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
natural hair which is a natural black so

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:10.969 
natural hair which is a natural black so
it<00:01:08.430> took<00:01:08.580> me<00:01:08.810> many<00:01:09.810> many<00:01:09.960> treatments<00:01:10.710> to<00:01:10.830> get

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979 
it took me many many treatments to get

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:13.490 
it took me many many treatments to get
this<00:01:11.220> light<00:01:11.520> but<00:01:12.360> it<00:01:12.510> is<00:01:12.690> doing<00:01:13.020> really<00:01:13.170> nicely

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500 
this light but it is doing really nicely

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:15.469 
this light but it is doing really nicely
now<00:01:13.830> and<00:01:14.100> it's<00:01:14.790> holding<00:01:14.970> the<00:01:15.270> color

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
now and it's holding the color

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:18.410 
now and it's holding the color
surprisingly<00:01:16.080> well<00:01:16.320> so<00:01:17.130> normally<00:01:17.760> what<00:01:18.060> I<00:01:18.120> did

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
surprisingly well so normally what I did

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:20.180 
surprisingly well so normally what I did
the<00:01:18.990> last<00:01:19.170> time<00:01:19.440> is<00:01:19.620> I<00:01:19.710> was<00:01:19.830> experimenting

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:20.190 
the last time is I was experimenting

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:22.820 
the last time is I was experimenting
with<00:01:20.520> different<00:01:21.390> conditioners<00:01:22.080> and<00:01:22.470> color

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830

safe<00:01:23.100> shampoos<00:01:23.520> and<00:01:23.820> no<00:01:23.970> matter<00:01:24.120> what<00:01:24.210> you

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
safe shampoos and no matter what you

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:27.550 
safe shampoos and no matter what you
have<00:01:25.140> to<00:01:25.350> use<00:01:25.530> a<00:01:25.560> color<00:01:25.979> safe<00:01:26.370> shampoo<00:01:27.060> any

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:27.560 
have to use a color safe shampoo any

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:31.520 
have to use a color safe shampoo any
kind<00:01:29.299> you<00:01:30.299> can<00:01:30.540> experiment<00:01:30.930> with<00:01:31.140> what<00:01:31.380> you

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
kind you can experiment with what you

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:34.520 
kind you can experiment with what you
like<00:01:31.740> but<00:01:32.220> red<00:01:32.520> is<00:01:33.080> particularly<00:01:34.080> hard<00:01:34.380> to

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530 
like but red is particularly hard to

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:37.490 
like but red is particularly hard to
keep<00:01:34.680> so<00:01:35.369> I<00:01:35.729> like<00:01:36.119> so<00:01:36.390> far<00:01:36.630> I<00:01:36.659> like<00:01:36.780> the<00:01:36.960> l'oreal

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:37.500 
keep so I like so far I like the l'oreal

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:40.430 
keep so I like so far I like the l'oreal
pure<00:01:38.010> the<00:01:39.000> everpure<00:01:39.540> shampoo<00:01:40.170> and

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:40.440 
pure the everpure shampoo and

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:43.010 
pure the everpure shampoo and
conditioner<00:01:40.890> the<00:01:41.159> moisture<00:01:41.580> one<00:01:41.729> I<00:01:41.909> feel<00:01:42.869> like

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
conditioner the moisture one I feel like

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:45.230 
conditioner the moisture one I feel like
it<00:01:43.170> really<00:01:43.320> locks<00:01:43.740> in<00:01:43.979> the<00:01:44.010> color<00:01:44.310> it<00:01:44.909> doesn't

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240 
it really locks in the color it doesn't

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:46.280 
it really locks in the color it doesn't
wash<00:01:45.360> it<00:01:45.510> out<00:01:45.540> too<00:01:45.720> much<00:01:45.840> because<00:01:46.020> it<00:01:46.200> is

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290 
wash it out too much because it is

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:48.830 
wash it out too much because it is
alcohol<00:01:46.680> free<00:01:46.920> and<00:01:47.100> it<00:01:47.939> just<00:01:48.180> it<00:01:48.390> keeps<00:01:48.659> my

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:48.840 
alcohol free and it just it keeps my

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:53.270 
alcohol free and it just it keeps my
hair<00:01:49.080> looking<00:01:49.619> nicer<00:01:50.159> for<00:01:50.430> long<00:01:51.020> longer<00:01:52.159> and<00:01:53.159> I

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 
hair looking nicer for long longer and I

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:55.190 
hair looking nicer for long longer and I
also<00:01:53.430> like<00:01:53.670> the<00:01:53.700> john<00:01:54.030> frieda<00:01:54.360> conditioner<00:01:55.020> in

me<00:02:34.209> such<00:02:34.450> a<00:02:34.480> nice<00:02:34.659> body<00:02:34.959> after<00:02:35.469> i'm<00:02:35.590> done<00:02:35.739> with

00:02:35.879 --> 00:02:35.889 
me such a nice body after i'm done with

00:02:35.889 --> 00:02:38.759 
me such a nice body after i'm done with
it<00:02:35.950> and<00:02:36.450> it<00:02:37.450> just<00:02:37.480> it<00:02:37.840> seems<00:02:38.109> to<00:02:38.230> keep<00:02:38.379> my<00:02:38.530> color

00:02:38.759 --> 00:02:38.769 
it and it just it seems to keep my color

00:02:38.769 --> 00:02:40.709 
it and it just it seems to keep my color
in<00:02:39.010> I<00:02:39.219> don't<00:02:39.519> know<00:02:39.609> why<00:02:39.819> because<00:02:40.480> I<00:02:40.569> would

00:02:40.709 --> 00:02:40.719 
in I don't know why because I would

00:02:40.719 --> 00:02:42.390 
in I don't know why because I would
think<00:02:40.840> the<00:02:41.019> tea<00:02:41.170> tree<00:02:41.349> oil<00:02:41.409> would<00:02:41.859> be<00:02:42.010> a<00:02:42.040> little

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:42.400 
think the tea tree oil would be a little

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:44.640 
think the tea tree oil would be a little
bit<00:02:42.579> more<00:02:42.670> acidic<00:02:43.090> but<00:02:43.299> it's<00:02:44.200> worked<00:02:44.469> really

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:44.650 
bit more acidic but it's worked really

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:46.140 
bit more acidic but it's worked really
well<00:02:44.769> so<00:02:45.129> far<00:02:45.159> so<00:02:45.340> I'm<00:02:45.579> going<00:02:45.700> to<00:02:45.730> keep<00:02:45.849> doing

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:46.150 
well so far so I'm going to keep doing

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:48.679 
well so far so I'm going to keep doing
that<00:02:46.269> and<00:02:46.329> hopefully<00:02:46.629> my<00:02:46.989> hair<00:02:47.170> grows<00:02:47.349> out<00:02:47.500> so

00:02:48.679 --> 00:02:48.689 
that and hopefully my hair grows out so

00:02:48.689 --> 00:02:51.420 
that and hopefully my hair grows out so
normally<00:02:49.689> i<00:02:49.720> do<00:02:49.900> do<00:02:50.200> quite<00:02:50.500> a<00:02:50.530> few<00:02:50.680> processes

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:51.430 
normally i do do quite a few processes

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:54.929 
normally i do do quite a few processes
on<00:02:51.970> my<00:02:52.359> hair<00:02:52.629> as<00:02:52.810> well<00:02:52.840> and<00:02:53.489> this<00:02:54.489> is<00:02:54.669> going<00:02:54.849> to

00:02:54.929 --> 00:02:54.939 
on my hair as well and this is going to

00:02:54.939 --> 00:02:58.199 
on my hair as well and this is going to
be<00:02:55.060> a<00:02:55.329> double<00:02:55.689> process<00:02:56.230> i<00:02:56.379> think<00:02:56.739> as<00:02:56.919> i<00:02:56.980> do<00:02:57.669> have

00:02:58.199 --> 00:02:58.209 
be a double process i think as i do have

00:02:58.209 --> 00:02:59.670 
be a double process i think as i do have
to<00:02:58.419> bleach<00:02:58.629> my<00:02:58.659> hair<00:02:58.870> and<00:02:59.200> then<00:02:59.319> i<00:02:59.349> have<00:02:59.439> to

00:02:59.670 --> 00:02:59.680 
to bleach my hair and then i have to

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:03.809 
to bleach my hair and then i have to
diet<00:02:59.889> so<00:03:00.930> it's<00:03:01.930> probably<00:03:02.260> not<00:03:02.469> the<00:03:02.919> best<00:03:02.950> for

00:03:03.809 --> 00:03:03.819 
diet so it's probably not the best for

00:03:03.819 --> 00:03:06.720 
diet so it's probably not the best for
my<00:03:03.969> hair<00:03:04.349> probably<00:03:05.349> the<00:03:05.500> black<00:03:05.709> dye<00:03:06.340> was

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:06.730 
my hair probably the black dye was

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:08.250 
my hair probably the black dye was
better<00:03:07.060> for<00:03:07.359> it<00:03:07.450> because<00:03:07.569> it<00:03:07.750> was<00:03:07.870> only<00:03:08.049> one

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:08.260 
better for it because it was only one

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:10.709 
better for it because it was only one
process<00:03:08.709> but<00:03:09.340> i<00:03:09.639> really<00:03:10.030> do<00:03:10.150> like<00:03:10.299> this<00:03:10.450> color

00:03:10.709 --> 00:03:10.719 
process but i really do like this color

00:03:10.719 --> 00:03:15.179 
process but i really do like this color
and<00:03:11.530> i<00:03:11.650> feel<00:03:11.919> like<00:03:12.719> it<00:03:13.719> illuminates<00:03:14.590> my<00:03:14.739> pale

00:03:15.179 --> 00:03:15.189 
and i feel like it illuminates my pale

00:03:15.189 --> 00:03:17.940 
and i feel like it illuminates my pale
skin<00:03:15.669> a<00:03:15.939> lot<00:03:16.480> better<00:03:16.840> than<00:03:17.319> the<00:03:17.409> black<00:03:17.650> did

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:17.950 
skin a lot better than the black did

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:19.740 
skin a lot better than the black did
because<00:03:18.519> for<00:03:18.790> the<00:03:18.909> longest<00:03:19.060> time<00:03:19.359> I<00:03:19.510> was

00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:19.750 
because for the longest time I was

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:21.869 
because for the longest time I was
saying<00:03:19.930> oh<00:03:20.109> you<00:03:20.919> know<00:03:21.040> my<00:03:21.280> black<00:03:21.459> hair<00:03:21.699> it

00:03:21.869 --> 00:03:21.879 
saying oh you know my black hair it

00:03:21.879 --> 00:03:23.640 
saying oh you know my black hair it
highlights<00:03:22.239> my<00:03:22.389> eyes<00:03:22.540> makes<00:03:23.169> my<00:03:23.319> skin<00:03:23.379> look

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:23.650 
highlights my eyes makes my skin look

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:26.460 
highlights my eyes makes my skin look
wider<00:03:23.949> yeah<00:03:24.519> it's<00:03:24.879> really<00:03:25.000> nice<00:03:25.180> and<00:03:25.449> then<00:03:26.440> I

00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:26.470 
wider yeah it's really nice and then I

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:28.020 
wider yeah it's really nice and then I
started<00:03:26.829> seeing<00:03:27.040> more<00:03:27.370> pictures<00:03:27.699> of<00:03:27.849> myself

00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:28.030 
started seeing more pictures of myself

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:32.819 
started seeing more pictures of myself
and<00:03:29.489> it<00:03:30.489> wasn't<00:03:30.970> looking<00:03:31.209> so<00:03:31.389> good<00:03:31.569> after<00:03:32.169> six

00:03:32.819 --> 00:03:32.829 
and it wasn't looking so good after six

00:03:32.829 --> 00:03:34.860 
and it wasn't looking so good after six
years<00:03:32.949> so<00:03:33.549> i<00:03:33.790> think<00:03:33.909> it<00:03:34.299> was<00:03:34.419> time<00:03:34.659> to<00:03:34.840> change

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:34.870 
years so i think it was time to change

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:37.800 
years so i think it was time to change
my<00:03:35.139> color<00:03:35.319> so<00:03:36.069> i<00:03:36.099> went<00:03:36.340> for<00:03:36.519> red<00:03:36.669> again<00:03:36.909> and<00:03:37.359> i

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:37.810 
my color so i went for red again and i

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:40.679 
my color so i went for red again and i
couldn't<00:03:38.199> be<00:03:38.229> happier<00:03:38.290> right<00:03:38.620> now<00:03:38.799> so<00:03:39.689> but

00:03:40.679 --> 00:03:40.689 
couldn't be happier right now so but

I<00:04:10.569> have<00:04:11.259> natural<00:04:11.739> black<00:04:11.919> hair<00:04:12.310> so<00:04:12.669> I<00:04:12.699> have<00:04:13.000> to

00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:13.120 
I have natural black hair so I have to

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:17.099 
I have natural black hair so I have to
die<00:04:13.269> at<00:04:13.689> least<00:04:14.079> every<00:04:14.370> four<00:04:15.370> weeks<00:04:15.519> so<00:04:15.849> if<00:04:16.509> I

00:04:17.099 --> 00:04:17.109 
die at least every four weeks so if I

00:04:17.109 --> 00:04:20.789 
die at least every four weeks so if I
can<00:04:17.259> stand<00:04:17.530> it<00:04:17.769> I'll<00:04:17.919> go<00:04:18.190> to<00:04:18.250> six<00:04:18.639> weeks<00:04:19.799> but

00:04:20.789 --> 00:04:20.799 
can stand it I'll go to six weeks but

00:04:20.799 --> 00:04:22.589 
can stand it I'll go to six weeks but
it'll<00:04:21.190> be<00:04:21.310> pretty<00:04:21.489> faded<00:04:21.759> by<00:04:21.970> that<00:04:22.180> point<00:04:22.360> so<00:04:22.479> i

00:04:22.589 --> 00:04:22.599 
it'll be pretty faded by that point so i

00:04:22.599 --> 00:04:24.360 
it'll be pretty faded by that point so i
recommend<00:04:23.020> probably<00:04:23.590> between<00:04:23.740> four<00:04:24.099> and<00:04:24.130> six
