00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
 You have a crisis of maturity trying to get where I've been 

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
 Well, Miss V, if you want that bad, you can have it 

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:20.000
 although when you see me arrive it is better that you go back, because I will try to hit you everywhere 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:35.000
 Oh, I do not hold my breath and I'm not going to shut up and I know you know that I do not fall before anyone, before anyone (x2) 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.000
 Oh, you should have stayed at home, you should know better 

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.000
 However I melt in your mouth like liquid sugar 

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:52.000
 You thought you could throw it in my face but, tell me, how do you know my leftovers? 

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:06.000
 With all your plastic surgery you seem to be in your 20's, though, darling, you'll never see yourself as well as I would cost you a lot more money 

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.000
 You can not keep your legs closed, your baratez and annoyance 

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.000
 And you'll ask yourself why you seem singular and with the past 30 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:28.000
 Oh, I do not hold my breath and I'm not going to shut up and I know you know that I do not fall before anyone, before anyone (x2) 

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:33.000
 Oh, you should have stayed at home, you should know better 

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.000
 However I melt in your mouth like liquid sugar 

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:45.000
 You thought you could throw it in my face but, tell me, how do you know my leftovers? 

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:57.000
 How do you know my leftovers? Tell me, how do you know my leftovers? (x2) 

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:15.000
 How do you know my leftovers? Tell me, how do you lick my plate? 

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:27.000
 Ooooooh How do you know my leftovers?
