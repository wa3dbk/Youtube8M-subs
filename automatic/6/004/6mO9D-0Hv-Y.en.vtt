00:00:00.740 --> 00:00:17.880
 I'm the sonja and show today 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:20.400
 I give you vegetable antipasti that we eat 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:23.640
 happy to be with white bread in summer 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:27.420
 butter and I have bought more here 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:29.310
 an aubergine then paprika red and yellow 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:31.890
 I do not think it would always be that green 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:33.840
 a bit bitter and then zucchini 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:37.860
 and you need dressing for the dressing 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:39.480
 garlic and lemon juice and it can 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:42.440
 we have other times I have the 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:47.700
 diced garlic 

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:48.620
 I need lemon juice then comes 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:01:01.350
 purely 

00:00:48.620 --> 00:01:11.909
 salt and then balsamic vinegar there come 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:14.420
 I enter several and uli I have to 

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:20.330
 make my vegetables and I start 

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:20.330
 with the eggplant the slices cut 

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:27.810
 put the then in a sieve in and 

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:30.630
 salt each slice of eggplant 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:33.210
 then the water is out and behind 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:36.150
 then she gives in a grill pan 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:38.250
 bit of olive oil grilled the zucchini 

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:41.100
 I also decide to cut and made 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:46.020
 in the grill pan in olive oil and 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:52.130
 Paprika the rest under the green 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:55.790
 he will be happy to come out now 

00:01:52.130 --> 00:02:00.770
 then I prepared myself a 

00:01:55.790 --> 00:02:00.770
 baking tray with aluminum foil 

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:11.070
 then it comes in under the oil in the 

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:12.380
 oven until the skin of paprika fraune 

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:16.140
 blows throws 

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:19.080
 and then I give it to cool in 

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:21.690
 A freezing bag makes it pure 

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:24.830
 cool that bit and then I can 

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:28.020
 namely peel the peppers quite easily 

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:31.520
 so the skin of paprika can then be 

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:34.140
 just pull off 

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:36.300
 I always recommend gloves too 

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:41.400
 otherwise the fingers will discolor 

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:45.300
 so i cut the paprika in three 

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:48.810
 parts to my marinade to my 

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:52.020
 I offered zucchini from both 

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:54.030
 I also share the eggplants 

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:56.940
 a little bit less so 

00:02:54.030 --> 00:03:00.140
 are and then you can still something 

00:02:56.940 --> 00:03:03.120
 of balsamic vinegar and olive oil 

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:05.820
 Add and I'll leave it one then 

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:08.850
 pull through the hour and then you can do that 

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:11.360
 eat with piece of white bread baguette 

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:15.120
 ciabatta and that's a great one 

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:16.880
 simple gentle summer dish exact 

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:19.260
 read as always on my homepage 

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:22.280
