00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:21.840 
2007 Crown Victoria basically let me

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:27.260 
2007 Crown Victoria basically let me
show<00:00:22.050> you<00:00:22.110> where<00:00:22.380> we're<00:00:22.560> at<00:00:22.740> so<00:00:26.029> I've<00:00:27.029> altered

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:27.270 
show you where we're at so I've altered

00:00:27.270 --> 00:00:28.880 
show you where we're at so I've altered
the<00:00:27.570> plumbing<00:00:27.960> and<00:00:28.079> everything<00:00:28.200> several

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:28.890 
the plumbing and everything several

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:30.799 
the plumbing and everything several
times<00:00:29.189> trying<00:00:29.460> to<00:00:29.610> get<00:00:29.730> the<00:00:29.910> best<00:00:30.090> run<00:00:30.419> on<00:00:30.450> just

00:00:30.799 --> 00:00:30.809 
times trying to get the best run on just

00:00:30.809 --> 00:00:33.680 
times trying to get the best run on just
the<00:00:31.050> hydroxy<00:00:31.710> and<00:00:32.099> we've<00:00:33.059> had<00:00:33.300> some<00:00:33.510> pretty

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:33.690 
the hydroxy and we've had some pretty

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:35.510 
the hydroxy and we've had some pretty
good<00:00:33.899> success<00:00:33.960> we've<00:00:34.590> got<00:00:34.770> our<00:00:34.890> new<00:00:35.070> pressure

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:35.520 
good success we've got our new pressure

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:37.370 
good success we've got our new pressure
regulator<00:00:36.149> in<00:00:36.360> there<00:00:36.540> and<00:00:36.690> basically<00:00:36.870> what

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:37.380 
regulator in there and basically what

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:38.150 
regulator in there and basically what
that's<00:00:37.530> for

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:38.160 
that's for

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:40.220 
that's for
is<00:00:38.820> the<00:00:39.030> computer<00:00:39.480> controls<00:00:39.870> to<00:00:40.050> feel

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:40.230 
is the computer controls to feel

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:42.200 
is the computer controls to feel
pressure<00:00:40.560> all<00:00:40.770> in<00:00:40.920> rail<00:00:41.220> and<00:00:41.640> we<00:00:41.790> wanted<00:00:42.090> to

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210 
pressure all in rail and we wanted to

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:43.880 
pressure all in rail and we wanted to
take<00:00:42.390> that<00:00:42.630> control<00:00:42.900> away<00:00:43.140> so<00:00:43.350> when<00:00:43.770> it

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890 
take that control away so when it

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:45.710 
take that control away so when it
escalates<00:00:44.490> higher<00:00:44.730> than<00:00:45.000> what<00:00:45.150> we<00:00:45.300> can<00:00:45.480> manage

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:45.720 
escalates higher than what we can manage

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:49.940 
escalates higher than what we can manage
out<00:00:46.050> of<00:00:46.170> our<00:00:46.880> blue<00:00:47.880> box<00:00:48.290> this<00:00:49.290> is<00:00:49.530> actually

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:49.950 
out of our blue box this is actually

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:52.310 
out of our blue box this is actually
going<00:00:50.100> to<00:00:50.250> return<00:00:50.700> the<00:00:50.970> excess<00:00:51.390> fuel<00:00:51.660> to<00:00:52.200> the

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320 
going to return the excess fuel to the

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:55.190 
going to return the excess fuel to the
gas<00:00:52.350> tank<00:00:52.940> now<00:00:53.940> to<00:00:54.000> do<00:00:54.360> the<00:00:54.480> repairs<00:00:54.870> on<00:00:55.050> the

00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:55.200 
gas tank now to do the repairs on the

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:57.010 
gas tank now to do the repairs on the
gas<00:00:55.380> tank<00:00:55.680> I<00:00:55.860> had<00:00:56.070> to<00:00:56.190> get<00:00:56.340> to<00:00:56.490> the<00:00:56.640> fuel<00:00:56.880> tank

00:00:57.010 --> 00:00:57.020 
gas tank I had to get to the fuel tank

00:00:57.020 --> 00:01:05.870 
gas tank I had to get to the fuel tank
completely<00:01:02.660> now<00:01:03.660> as<00:01:03.900> you<00:01:04.110> can<00:01:04.259> see<00:01:04.549> we<00:01:05.549> put<00:01:05.579> a

completely now as you can see we put a

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:09.230 
completely now as you can see we put a
new<00:01:06.119> little<00:01:07.100> nozzle<00:01:08.100> into<00:01:08.280> the<00:01:08.430> fuel<00:01:08.759> tank<00:01:09.060> and

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240 
new little nozzle into the fuel tank and

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:11.270 
new little nozzle into the fuel tank and
just<00:01:09.420> JB<00:01:09.869> welded<00:01:10.229> in<00:01:10.409> their<00:01:10.649> repaired<00:01:11.070> all<00:01:11.250> a

rattles a run down in the heels you can

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:41.180 
rattles a run down in the heels you can
see<00:01:38.760> we've<00:01:38.940> gone<00:01:39.150> through<00:01:39.450> a<00:01:39.479> lot<00:01:39.690> of<00:01:39.720> water<00:01:40.190> so

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:41.190 
see we've gone through a lot of water so

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:43.039 
see we've gone through a lot of water so
I<00:01:41.220> know<00:01:41.400> that<00:01:41.760> we're<00:01:41.909> producing<00:01:42.360> lots<00:01:42.659> of

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:43.049 
I know that we're producing lots of

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:48.080 
I know that we're producing lots of
hydrogen<00:01:43.470> lots<00:01:44.159> of<00:01:44.400> hydrogen<00:01:46.640> and<00:01:47.640> we<00:01:47.940> got

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090 
hydrogen lots of hydrogen and we got

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:50.270 
hydrogen lots of hydrogen and we got
everything<00:01:48.540> all<00:01:48.930> put<00:01:49.229> together<00:01:49.409> inside<00:01:50.070> the

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280 
everything all put together inside the

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:54.800 
everything all put together inside the
vehicle

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:57.560 

as<00:01:55.770> you<00:01:56.070> can<00:01:56.130> see<00:01:56.430> we<00:01:56.700> have<00:01:56.850> a<00:01:56.880> pressure<00:01:57.270> gauge

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:57.570 
as you can see we have a pressure gauge

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:00.499 
as you can see we have a pressure gauge
which<00:01:57.869> shows<00:01:58.110> us<00:01:58.350> our<00:01:58.500> manifold<00:01:59.040> pressure<00:01:59.509> we

00:02:00.499 --> 00:02:00.509 
which shows us our manifold pressure we

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:02.149 
which shows us our manifold pressure we
have<00:02:00.540> the<00:02:00.840> altar<00:02:01.140> gauge<00:02:01.350> mounted<00:02:01.829> up<00:02:01.979> on<00:02:02.100> the

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:02.159 
have the altar gauge mounted up on the

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:05.929 
have the altar gauge mounted up on the
top<00:02:02.490> so<00:02:02.820> the<00:02:03.000> driver<00:02:03.450> has<00:02:03.780> pretty<00:02:04.079> much<00:02:04.939> eyes

00:02:05.929 --> 00:02:05.939 
top so the driver has pretty much eyes

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:08.059 
top so the driver has pretty much eyes
on<00:02:06.329> all<00:02:06.600> the<00:02:06.720> gauges<00:02:07.110> all<00:02:07.289> the<00:02:07.409> time<00:02:07.680> and<00:02:07.950> how

00:02:08.059 --> 00:02:08.069 
on all the gauges all the time and how

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:09.620 
on all the gauges all the time and how
we're<00:02:08.250> going<00:02:08.340> to<00:02:08.429> be<00:02:08.550> regulating<00:02:09.179> our<00:02:09.330> bias

00:02:09.620 --> 00:02:09.630 
we're going to be regulating our bias

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:11.570 
we're going to be regulating our bias
pressure<00:02:10.080> where<00:02:10.530> the<00:02:10.649> fuel<00:02:10.950> is<00:02:11.190> with<00:02:11.400> that

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:11.580 
pressure where the fuel is with that

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:15.050 
pressure where the fuel is with that
little<00:02:11.819> rheostat<00:02:12.450> there<00:02:13.459> anyway<00:02:14.459> I've<00:02:14.790> got

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:15.060 
little rheostat there anyway I've got

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:18.470 
little rheostat there anyway I've got
the<00:02:15.300> new<00:02:15.750> laptop<00:02:15.780> all<00:02:16.470> fixed<00:02:16.860> up<00:02:17.269> ready<00:02:18.269> to

the new laptop all fixed up ready to

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:21.740 
the new laptop all fixed up ready to
rock<00:02:18.660> and<00:02:18.690> roll<00:02:18.959> here<00:02:19.760> and<00:02:20.760> I'm<00:02:21.420> going<00:02:21.540> to<00:02:21.569> show

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:21.750 
rock and roll here and I'm going to show

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:24.949 
rock and roll here and I'm going to show
you<00:02:21.840> how<00:02:21.989> everything<00:02:22.140> works<00:02:22.650> now<00:02:23.840> what<00:02:24.840> we

00:02:24.949 --> 00:02:24.959 
you how everything works now what we

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:26.449 
you how everything works now what we
have<00:02:25.110> to<00:02:25.260> do<00:02:25.410> just<00:02:25.650> build<00:02:25.920> up<00:02:26.069> just<00:02:26.310> a<00:02:26.430> little

00:02:26.449 --> 00:02:26.459 
have to do just build up just a little

00:02:26.459 --> 00:02:29.330 
have to do just build up just a little
bit<00:02:26.700> more<00:02:27.000> pressure<00:02:27.330> likes<00:02:27.840> twenty-plus<00:02:28.590> to

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:29.340 
bit more pressure likes twenty-plus to

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:34.190 
bit more pressure likes twenty-plus to
run<00:02:29.549> Mountain<00:02:30.470> while<00:02:31.470> it's<00:02:31.709> doing<00:02:31.920> back<00:02:33.200> I'm

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:34.200 
run Mountain while it's doing back I'm

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:35.660 
run Mountain while it's doing back I'm
going<00:02:34.410> to<00:02:34.500> show<00:02:34.709> you<00:02:34.739> that<00:02:35.100> we<00:02:35.640> have

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:35.670 
going to show you that we have

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:38.030 
going to show you that we have
absolutely<00:02:36.660> no<00:02:36.870> fuel<00:02:37.230> in<00:02:37.440> the<00:02:37.560> gas<00:02:37.709> tank

we're going to be running on is that

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:46.100 
we're going to be running on is that
hydroxy<00:02:43.110> pressure<00:02:43.380> on<00:02:43.709> the<00:02:43.920> gauge<00:02:44.870> now<00:02:45.870> that

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:46.110 
hydroxy pressure on the gauge now that

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:49.070 
hydroxy pressure on the gauge now that
I've<00:02:46.200> got<00:02:46.410> the<00:02:46.560> system<00:02:47.010> up<00:02:47.900> we're<00:02:48.900> going<00:02:49.019> to

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:49.080 
I've got the system up we're going to

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:53.259 
I've got the system up we're going to
hit<00:02:49.260> go<00:02:49.440> ahead<00:02:49.620> and<00:02:49.739> plug<00:02:49.950> in<00:02:50.130> our<00:02:50.250> little<00:02:50.930> USB

morning<00:03:19.280> you<00:03:19.340> see<00:03:19.519> we're<00:03:19.760> running<00:03:20.090> on<00:03:20.239> about

00:03:21.449 --> 00:03:21.459 
morning you see we're running on about

00:03:21.459 --> 00:03:25.960 
morning you see we're running on about
50<00:03:22.459> amps<00:03:23.769> we've<00:03:24.769> installed<00:03:25.190> the<00:03:25.400> gauge<00:03:25.580> so<00:03:25.849> we

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:25.970 
50 amps we've installed the gauge so we

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:27.940 
50 amps we've installed the gauge so we
can<00:03:26.150> see<00:03:26.360> with<00:03:26.540> our<00:03:26.569> pressure<00:03:26.989> is<00:03:27.200> and<00:03:27.590> this<00:03:27.739> is

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:27.950 
can see with our pressure is and this is

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:33.729 
can see with our pressure is and this is
our<00:03:28.160> maiden<00:03:28.550> voyage<00:03:28.790> on<00:03:29.260> hydrogen<00:03:32.560> and<00:03:33.560> that

00:03:33.729 --> 00:03:33.739 
our maiden voyage on hydrogen and that

00:03:33.739 --> 00:03:38.290 
our maiden voyage on hydrogen and that
down<00:03:33.980> a<00:03:34.010> little<00:03:34.250> bit<00:03:34.400> about<00:03:34.670> 20

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:38.300 

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:43.300 

we<00:03:38.810> are<00:03:38.930> running<00:03:39.140> just<00:03:39.290> on<00:03:39.680> water<00:03:42.130> we<00:03:43.130> got<00:03:43.280> a

00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:43.310 
we are running just on water we got a

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:45.190 
we are running just on water we got a
pretty<00:03:43.610> good<00:03:43.670> grade<00:03:44.000> coming<00:03:44.420> out<00:03:44.660> here<00:03:44.960> so

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:45.200 
pretty good grade coming out here so

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:46.510 
pretty good grade coming out here so
this<00:03:45.380> is<00:03:45.560> going<00:03:45.740> to<00:03:45.830> be<00:03:45.980> a<00:03:46.010> pretty<00:03:46.280> good

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:46.520 
this is going to be a pretty good

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:48.880 
this is going to be a pretty good
opportunity<00:03:47.450> for<00:03:47.840> us<00:03:48.080> to<00:03:48.320> see<00:03:48.530> what<00:03:48.710> he's

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:48.890 
opportunity for us to see what he's

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:57.460 
opportunity for us to see what he's
gonna<00:03:49.130> work<00:03:49.400> it<00:03:49.610> up

00:03:57.460 --> 00:03:57.470 

00:03:57.470 --> 00:04:06.350 

you<00:03:58.040> can<00:03:58.190> see<00:03:58.400> we're<00:03:58.580> completely<00:03:59.000> out<00:03:59.150> of<00:03:59.420> feel

00:04:06.350 --> 00:04:06.360 

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:08.270 

a<00:04:06.450> little<00:04:06.960> bit<00:04:07.080> rough<00:04:07.350> or<00:04:07.650> hoping<00:04:07.950> that<00:04:08.130> the

00:04:08.270 --> 00:04:08.280 
a little bit rough or hoping that the

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:21.690 
a little bit rough or hoping that the
Volvo<00:04:08.670> will<00:04:08.850> take<00:04:09.660> over<00:04:09.870> here

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:21.700 

00:04:21.700 --> 00:04:24.170 

like<00:04:22.330> I<00:04:22.360> say<00:04:22.660> it's<00:04:22.870> really<00:04:23.200> hard<00:04:23.470> to<00:04:23.800> get<00:04:24.010> a

00:04:24.170 --> 00:04:24.180 
like I say it's really hard to get a

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:27.330 
like I say it's really hard to get a
standard<00:04:25.180> engine<00:04:25.510> especially<00:04:26.340> computerized

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:27.340 
standard engine especially computerized

00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:29.100 
standard engine especially computerized
one<00:04:27.610> to<00:04:27.820> do<00:04:27.940> all<00:04:28.150> the<00:04:28.300> things<00:04:28.510> that<00:04:28.630> you<00:04:28.840> wanted

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:29.110 
one to do all the things that you wanted

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:32.160 
one to do all the things that you wanted
to<00:04:29.290> do<00:04:29.910> but<00:04:30.910> we've<00:04:31.120> come<00:04:31.360> pretty<00:04:31.570> close<00:04:31.780> to<00:04:32.050> the

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:32.170 
to do but we've come pretty close to the

00:04:32.170 --> 00:04:41.139 
to do but we've come pretty close to the
bolo<00:04:32.410> with<00:04:32.770> the<00:04:32.950> sh<00:04:33.400> o<00:04:34.050> program<00:04:35.050> in<00:04:35.260> it

00:04:41.139 --> 00:04:41.149 

00:04:41.149 --> 00:04:44.959 

here<00:04:42.149> we<00:04:42.269> are<00:04:42.299> just<00:04:42.689> driving<00:04:43.199> on<00:04:43.289> water<00:04:43.759> yes<00:04:44.759> we

00:04:44.959 --> 00:04:44.969 
here we are just driving on water yes we

00:04:44.969 --> 00:04:49.309 
here we are just driving on water yes we
can<00:04:45.209> motivate<00:04:46.819> windows<00:04:47.819> here<00:04:48.119> hear<00:04:49.049> what<00:04:49.229> I'm

00:04:49.309 --> 00:04:49.319 
can motivate windows here hear what I'm

00:04:49.319 --> 00:04:58.280 
can motivate windows here hear what I'm
saying

00:04:58.280 --> 00:04:58.290 

00:04:58.290 --> 00:05:00.590 

and<00:04:58.560> we've<00:04:59.220> got<00:04:59.400> things<00:04:59.640> down<00:04:59.940> to<00:05:00.120> about<00:05:00.240> four

00:05:00.590 --> 00:05:00.600 
and we've got things down to about four

00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:02.780 
and we've got things down to about four
amps<00:05:00.960> all<00:05:01.260> we're<00:05:01.440> cruising<00:05:01.830> on<00:05:01.950> right<00:05:02.190> now<00:05:02.370> now

00:05:02.780 --> 00:05:02.790 
amps all we're cruising on right now now

00:05:02.790 --> 00:05:05.150 
amps all we're cruising on right now now
the<00:05:03.570> difference<00:05:04.080> is<00:05:04.260> when<00:05:04.620> we<00:05:04.770> get<00:05:04.920> things

00:05:05.150 --> 00:05:05.160 
the difference is when we get things

00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:11.180 
the difference is when we get things
that<00:05:05.460> high<00:05:05.730> and<00:05:05.970> pressure<00:05:08.060> the<00:05:09.560> HHO<00:05:10.590> has<00:05:10.920> a<00:05:10.950> lot

00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:11.190 
that high and pressure the HHO has a lot

00:05:11.190 --> 00:05:12.650 
that high and pressure the HHO has a lot
more<00:05:11.400> energy<00:05:11.610> because<00:05:12.120> I<00:05:12.270> think<00:05:12.510> we're

00:05:12.650 --> 00:05:12.660 
more energy because I think we're

00:05:12.660 --> 00:05:14.690 
more energy because I think we're
actually<00:05:12.810> folding<00:05:13.560> the<00:05:13.710> hydrogen<00:05:14.220> molecules

00:05:14.690 --> 00:05:14.700 
actually folding the hydrogen molecules

00:05:14.700 --> 00:05:18.890 
actually folding the hydrogen molecules
together<00:05:14.910> to<00:05:15.300> make<00:05:15.450> a<00:05:15.600> CH<00:05:15.630> for<00:05:17.540> anybody<00:05:18.540> has<00:05:18.870> a

00:05:18.890 --> 00:05:18.900 
together to make a CH for anybody has a

00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:20.660 
together to make a CH for anybody has a
lot<00:05:19.200> more<00:05:19.230> energy<00:05:19.830> the<00:05:19.980> higher<00:05:20.160> the<00:05:20.400> pressure

00:05:20.660 --> 00:05:20.670 
lot more energy the higher the pressure

00:05:20.670 --> 00:05:24.260 
lot more energy the higher the pressure
you<00:05:20.940> go<00:05:21.150> the<00:05:21.780> more<00:05:21.930> energy<00:05:22.410> it<00:05:22.500> has<00:05:23.270> little

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:24.270 
you go the more energy it has little

00:05:24.270 --> 00:05:38.690 
you go the more energy it has little
step<00:05:24.480> on<00:05:24.690> it<00:05:24.840> here

00:05:38.690 --> 00:05:38.700 

00:05:38.700 --> 00:05:41.270 

I'm<00:05:39.240> a<00:05:39.420> little<00:05:39.780> bit<00:05:39.990> jumpy<00:05:40.230> but<00:05:40.620> hey<00:05:40.860> we're

00:05:41.270 --> 00:05:41.280 
I'm a little bit jumpy but hey we're

00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:43.580 
I'm a little bit jumpy but hey we're
running<00:05:41.610> on<00:05:41.760> water<00:05:42.000> what<00:05:42.300> do<00:05:42.360> you<00:05:42.450> expect<00:05:42.600> yeah

00:05:43.580 --> 00:05:43.590 
running on water what do you expect yeah

00:05:43.590 --> 00:05:47.350 
running on water what do you expect yeah
we're<00:05:43.860> up<00:05:43.980> to<00:05:44.130> about<00:05:44.250> 90<00:05:44.790> on<00:05:44.970> a<00:05:45.000> 35<00:05:45.930> some<00:05:46.320> inner

00:05:47.350 --> 00:05:47.360 
we're up to about 90 on a 35 some inner

00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:54.480 
we're up to about 90 on a 35 some inner
cooler<00:05:48.360> jets<00:05:48.660> attack

00:05:54.480 --> 00:05:54.490 

00:05:54.490 --> 00:05:56.550 

anyway<00:05:55.330> I'm<00:05:55.479> going<00:05:55.720> to<00:05:55.810> splice<00:05:56.050> a<00:05:56.110> couple

00:05:56.550 --> 00:05:56.560 
anyway I'm going to splice a couple

00:05:56.560 --> 00:05:58.499 
anyway I'm going to splice a couple
pieces<00:05:56.949> from<00:05:57.190> one<00:05:57.400> before<00:05:57.789> I<00:05:57.819> got<00:05:58.000> the<00:05:58.180> car<00:05:58.360> off

00:05:58.499 --> 00:05:58.509 
pieces from one before I got the car off

00:05:58.509 --> 00:06:00.809 
pieces from one before I got the car off
the<00:05:58.539> jack<00:05:58.960> stands<00:05:59.319> again<00:06:00.220> this<00:06:00.430> is<00:06:00.610> before

00:06:00.809 --> 00:06:00.819 
the jack stands again this is before

00:06:00.819 --> 00:06:06.570 
the jack stands again this is before
fuel<00:06:02.370> we're<00:06:03.370> running<00:06:03.699> on<00:06:03.849> just<00:06:04.470> the<00:06:05.580> hydroxy

00:06:06.570 --> 00:06:06.580 
fuel we're running on just the hydroxy

00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:10.090 
pressure in the injection rail and we're

00:06:10.090 --> 00:06:13.650 
pressure in the injection rail and we're
doing<00:06:10.240> it<00:06:10.889> about<00:06:11.889> five<00:06:12.250> amps<00:06:12.729> pretty

00:06:13.650 --> 00:06:13.660 
doing it about five amps pretty

00:06:13.660 --> 00:06:19.320 
doing it about five amps pretty
miraculous<00:06:14.229> I<00:06:14.530> think<00:06:17.220> now<00:06:18.220> we<00:06:18.280> have<00:06:18.669> probably

00:06:19.320 --> 00:06:19.330 
miraculous I think now we have probably

00:06:19.330 --> 00:06:21.990 
miraculous I think now we have probably
a<00:06:19.419> gallons<00:06:19.990> worth<00:06:20.289> of<00:06:20.500> pressurized<00:06:21.400> space<00:06:21.759> in

00:06:21.990 --> 00:06:22.000 
a gallons worth of pressurized space in

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:24.839 
a gallons worth of pressurized space in
there<00:06:22.319> so<00:06:23.319> now<00:06:23.560> that<00:06:23.620> my<00:06:23.860> pressures<00:06:24.340> gone<00:06:24.580> down

00:06:24.839 --> 00:06:24.849 
there so now that my pressures gone down

00:06:24.849 --> 00:06:26.159 
there so now that my pressures gone down
a<00:06:24.880> little<00:06:25.030> bit<00:06:25.270> I'm<00:06:25.479> going<00:06:25.660> to<00:06:25.720> hit<00:06:25.930> a<00:06:26.020> little

00:06:26.159 --> 00:06:26.169 
a little bit I'm going to hit a little

00:06:26.169 --> 00:06:32.220 
a little bit I'm going to hit a little
bit<00:06:26.349> more<00:06:26.680> amperage

00:06:32.220 --> 00:06:32.230 

00:06:32.230 --> 00:06:36.540 

I<00:06:32.490> promise<00:06:33.490> up<00:06:33.670> to<00:06:33.790> about<00:06:33.970> 16<00:06:35.280> we're<00:06:36.280> going

00:06:36.540 --> 00:06:36.550 
I promise up to about 16 we're going

00:06:36.550 --> 00:06:38.430 
I promise up to about 16 we're going
downhill<00:06:36.760> and<00:06:37.180> not<00:06:37.300> using<00:06:37.720> anything<00:06:37.990> it's

00:06:38.430 --> 00:06:38.440 
downhill and not using anything it's

00:06:38.440 --> 00:06:44.070 
downhill and not using anything it's
time<00:06:38.710> to<00:06:38.920> Spacey<00:06:42.240> no<00:06:43.240> problems<00:06:43.690> because<00:06:43.900> we're

00:06:44.070 --> 00:06:44.080 
time to Spacey no problems because we're

00:06:44.080 --> 00:06:47.250 
time to Spacey no problems because we're
drying<00:06:44.380> but<00:06:44.680> 18<00:06:45.160> ants<00:06:45.400> from<00:06:45.730> the<00:06:46.260> charging

00:06:47.250 --> 00:06:47.260 
drying but 18 ants from the charging

00:06:47.260 --> 00:06:52.900 
drying but 18 ants from the charging
system

00:06:52.900 --> 00:06:52.910 

00:06:52.910 --> 00:06:55.630 

excuse<00:06:53.750> the<00:06:53.780> shaky<00:06:54.380> video<00:06:54.770> but<00:06:55.040> this<00:06:55.220> is<00:06:55.460> what

00:06:55.630 --> 00:06:55.640 
excuse the shaky video but this is what

00:06:55.640 --> 00:06:58.050 
excuse the shaky video but this is what
I<00:06:55.670> got<00:06:55.910> to<00:06:55.940> work<00:06:56.090> with

00:06:58.050 --> 00:06:58.060 
I got to work with

00:06:58.060 --> 00:06:59.820 
I got to work with
and<00:06:58.300> I<00:06:58.480> think<00:06:58.690> we're<00:06:58.870> doing<00:06:59.020> pretty<00:06:59.140> darn<00:06:59.590> good

00:06:59.820 --> 00:06:59.830 
and I think we're doing pretty darn good

00:06:59.830 --> 00:07:02.790 
and I think we're doing pretty darn good
with<00:07:00.040> what<00:07:00.220> we're<00:07:00.430> working<00:07:00.460> was<00:07:01.000> here<00:07:01.800> thank

00:07:02.790 --> 00:07:02.800 
with what we're working was here thank

00:07:02.800 --> 00:07:05.070 
with what we're working was here thank
Jesus<00:07:03.220> this<00:07:03.640> thing<00:07:03.940> is<00:07:04.120> running<00:07:04.330> great<00:07:04.660> now

00:07:05.070 --> 00:07:05.080 
Jesus this thing is running great now

00:07:05.080 --> 00:07:08.220 
Jesus this thing is running great now
kind<00:07:05.860> of<00:07:05.920> now<00:07:06.610> that<00:07:06.820> we've<00:07:06.970> almost<00:07:07.690> got<00:07:08.050> the

00:07:08.220 --> 00:07:08.230 
kind of now that we've almost got the

00:07:08.230 --> 00:07:11.310 
kind of now that we've almost got the
engine<00:07:08.500> up<00:07:08.650> to<00:07:08.800> temperature<00:07:09.750> that<00:07:10.750> means<00:07:10.810> that

00:07:11.310 --> 00:07:11.320 
engine up to temperature that means that

00:07:11.320 --> 00:07:15.150 
engine up to temperature that means that
it's<00:07:11.500> going<00:07:11.680> to<00:07:13.290> be<00:07:14.290> heating<00:07:14.710> up<00:07:14.770> the<00:07:14.950> water

00:07:15.150 --> 00:07:15.160 
it's going to be heating up the water

00:07:15.160 --> 00:07:17.460 
it's going to be heating up the water
the<00:07:15.550> cell<00:07:15.790> will<00:07:15.940> put<00:07:16.120> out<00:07:16.240> that<00:07:16.570> orange<00:07:16.870> steam

00:07:17.460 --> 00:07:17.470 
the cell will put out that orange steam

00:07:17.470 --> 00:07:20.220 
the cell will put out that orange steam
seems<00:07:17.830> to<00:07:18.070> slow<00:07:18.340> down<00:07:18.520> the<00:07:18.820> burn<00:07:19.660> rate<00:07:19.960> and

00:07:20.220 --> 00:07:20.230 
seems to slow down the burn rate and

00:07:20.230 --> 00:07:21.600 
seems to slow down the burn rate and
make<00:07:20.440> it<00:07:20.620> a<00:07:20.680> little<00:07:20.860> bit<00:07:21.040> more<00:07:21.220> compatible

00:07:21.600 --> 00:07:21.610 
make it a little bit more compatible

00:07:21.610 --> 00:07:24.270 
make it a little bit more compatible
with<00:07:22.030> the<00:07:22.150> vehicle's<00:07:22.600> computer<00:07:23.080> I<00:07:23.380> think<00:07:23.920> what

00:07:24.270 --> 00:07:24.280 
with the vehicle's computer I think what

00:07:24.280 --> 00:07:25.710 
with the vehicle's computer I think what
we're<00:07:24.460> going<00:07:24.580> to<00:07:24.640> need<00:07:24.910> in<00:07:25.090> the<00:07:25.210> future<00:07:25.420> is

00:07:25.710 --> 00:07:25.720 
we're going to need in the future is

00:07:25.720 --> 00:07:27.960 
we're going to need in the future is
probably<00:07:26.110> a<00:07:26.200> dual<00:07:26.530> injection<00:07:27.160> system<00:07:27.610> for<00:07:27.790> one

00:07:27.960 --> 00:07:27.970 
probably a dual injection system for one

00:07:27.970 --> 00:07:32.499 
probably a dual injection system for one
of<00:07:28.090> these

00:07:32.499 --> 00:07:32.509 

00:07:32.509 --> 00:07:35.300 

where<00:07:33.509> we<00:07:33.659> can<00:07:33.840> inject<00:07:34.139> the<00:07:34.349> fuel<00:07:34.620> and<00:07:34.949> the

00:07:35.300 --> 00:07:35.310 
where we can inject the fuel and the

00:07:35.310 --> 00:07:37.309 
where we can inject the fuel and the
hydroxy<00:07:35.969> because<00:07:36.180> when<00:07:36.389> we<00:07:36.539> go<00:07:36.689> to<00:07:36.749> mix<00:07:37.020> things

00:07:37.309 --> 00:07:37.319 
hydroxy because when we go to mix things

00:07:37.319 --> 00:07:39.020 
hydroxy because when we go to mix things
it<00:07:37.590> gets<00:07:37.800> a<00:07:37.889> little<00:07:38.009> bit<00:07:38.249> complicated<00:07:38.639> because

00:07:39.020 --> 00:07:39.030 
it gets a little bit complicated because

00:07:39.030 --> 00:07:40.700 
it gets a little bit complicated because
you<00:07:39.150> always<00:07:39.389> have<00:07:39.689> one<00:07:39.930> trying<00:07:40.289> to<00:07:40.409> overwork

00:07:40.700 --> 00:07:40.710 
you always have one trying to overwork

00:07:40.710 --> 00:07:42.890 
you always have one trying to overwork
the<00:07:40.949> other<00:07:41.069> one<00:07:41.279> we<00:07:42.150> don't<00:07:42.360> have<00:07:42.479> a<00:07:42.509> really

00:07:42.890 --> 00:07:42.900 
the other one we don't have a really

00:07:42.900 --> 00:07:44.779 
the other one we don't have a really
good<00:07:43.050> proportioning<00:07:43.740> system<00:07:44.189> it's<00:07:44.340> just<00:07:44.460> kind

00:07:44.779 --> 00:07:44.789 
good proportioning system it's just kind

00:07:44.789 --> 00:07:46.879 
good proportioning system it's just kind
of<00:07:44.849> line-of-sight<00:07:45.389> watch<00:07:45.659> your<00:07:45.930> gauges<00:07:46.169> time

00:07:46.879 --> 00:07:46.889 
of line-of-sight watch your gauges time

00:07:46.889 --> 00:07:49.369

00:07:49.369 --> 00:07:49.379 
to be able anyway this is doing

00:07:49.379 --> 00:07:52.519 
to be able anyway this is doing
marvelous<00:07:49.590> this<00:07:50.099> morning<00:07:50.520> and<00:07:51.259> this<00:07:52.259> is

00:07:52.519 --> 00:07:52.529 
marvelous this morning and this is

00:07:52.529 --> 00:07:54.499 
marvelous this morning and this is
probably<00:07:52.830> the<00:07:53.099> end<00:07:53.249> of<00:07:53.370> our<00:07:53.520> series<00:07:53.969> 3<00:07:54.180> video

00:07:54.499 --> 00:07:54.509 
probably the end of our series 3 video

00:07:54.509 --> 00:07:56.890 
probably the end of our series 3 video
because<00:07:54.840> I<00:07:54.960> better<00:07:55.169> concentrate<00:07:55.830> on<00:07:55.979> driving

00:07:56.890 --> 00:07:56.900
