00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.009
 hi my name is possible dima in this 

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:08.849
 video would like to tell you how to weave 

00:00:04.009 --> 00:00:14.450
 broom straight weave here I sleep . 

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:21.230
 for at home why don't you take it off 

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:24.570
 one strand pushes a string of raspberries and 

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:28.349
 down that is it turns out like this then 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:32.130
 twist and thrust this thread here 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:36.590
 here that is, it turns out the usual node 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:36.590
 and tighten it 

00:00:38.899 --> 00:00:45.059
 it turns out such a knot from 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:49.559
 such nodules occur our whole 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:53.570
 bauble take the next and do exactly 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:59.579
 the same knot we pass down spinning and 

00:00:53.570 --> 00:01:02.420
 in the eyelet and again tightened happened 

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:09.000
 one more knot 

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:15.320
 again we take we push down we twist 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:15.320
 their eyelet and tighten again 

00:01:21.149 --> 00:01:27.430
 so we reached the end of the series and now we 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:30.460
 people tied a knot to the last and 

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:33.159
 tied knot one more to find in 

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:35.880
 soak the other side too 

00:01:33.159 --> 00:01:38.470
 nodule and it turns out such here 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:40.720
 it turns out on 1 erased went to 

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:42.460
 and now it turns out my calls in another 

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:46.509
 direction then again here in this and 

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:53.880
 back let's show you take 

00:01:46.509 --> 00:01:59.759
 thread cracking tripod take thread 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:59.759
 fold the loops in and out 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:19.420
 take a thread for this thread 

00:02:08.549 --> 00:02:24.450
 we turn and in loops here on 

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:24.450
 case if forgot showed once again 

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:34.000
 I will say that we will succeed when weaving 

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:41.799
 This row guarantees fingers 

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:48.290
 fans and chick in general oh my god here we have 

00:02:41.799 --> 00:02:54.439
 it turns out now here 

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:57.519
 so here we get thanks for 

00:02:54.439 --> 00:02:57.519
 view bye bye
