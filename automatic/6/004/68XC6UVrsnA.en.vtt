00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:50.250

like that but it looks like our next DLC
will<00:02:50.880> probably<00:02:51.450> be<00:02:51.750> Easter<00:02:52.380> time<00:02:52.590> so<00:02:52.950> just<00:02:53.370> in

a<00:02:53.580> couple<00:02:53.820> of<00:02:53.880> weeks<00:02:53.940> maybe<00:02:54.330> we<00:02:55.230> should<00:02:55.410> be

00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:55.500 
a couple of weeks maybe we should be

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:57.410

00:02:57.410 --> 00:02:57.420 
getting hopefully in my opinion

00:02:57.420 --> 00:02:59.660
