that picture in a second if i zoom in
here<00:00:46.440> at<00:00:46.770> the<00:00:46.920> bottom<00:00:47.370> you<00:00:48.149> can<00:00:48.180> see<00:00:48.360> that<00:00:49.230> it

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
here at the bottom you can see that it

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:52.729 
here at the bottom you can see that it
looks<00:00:49.800> exactly<00:00:50.219> like<00:00:50.670> the<00:00:51.149> m8<00:00:51.539> now<00:00:51.780> and<00:00:52.140> they

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:52.739 
looks exactly like the m8 now and they

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:54.529 
looks exactly like the m8 now and they
could<00:00:52.949> be<00:00:53.070> on-screen<00:00:53.760> buttons<00:00:54.180> but<00:00:54.360> they've

00:00:54.529 --> 00:00:54.539 
could be on-screen buttons but they've

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:58.750 
could be on-screen buttons but they've
moved<00:00:54.809> the<00:00:55.350> HTC<00:00:56.070> logo<00:00:56.250> to<00:00:56.579> the<00:00:56.699> top<00:00:56.969> now

00:00:58.750 --> 00:00:58.760 
moved the HTC logo to the top now

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:01.340 
moved the HTC logo to the top now
there's<00:00:59.760> a<00:00:59.850> couple<00:01:00.059> of<00:01:00.270> speculations<00:01:00.989> with

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
there's a couple of speculations with

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:03.349 
there's a couple of speculations with
this<00:01:01.559> that<00:01:01.829> means<00:01:02.129> that<00:01:02.309> the<00:01:02.399> display<00:01:02.820> if<00:01:03.059> it's

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359 
this that means that the display if it's

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:07.010 
this that means that the display if it's
on-screen<00:01:03.899> buttons<00:01:04.640> with<00:01:05.640> the<00:01:05.850> smaller<00:01:06.270> HTC

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
on-screen buttons with the smaller HTC

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:09.830 
on-screen buttons with the smaller HTC
logo<00:01:07.640> the<00:01:08.640> display<00:01:09.119> could<00:01:09.330> be<00:01:09.450> slightly

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
logo the display could be slightly

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:12.380 
logo the display could be slightly
bigger<00:01:10.500> inside<00:01:11.250> of<00:01:11.549> this<00:01:11.670> Windows<00:01:12.030> Phone<00:01:12.210> I

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390 
bigger inside of this Windows Phone I

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:14.030 
bigger inside of this Windows Phone I
think<00:01:12.659> it's<00:01:12.780> going<00:01:12.840> to<00:01:12.930> be<00:01:13.020> exactly<00:01:13.799> the<00:01:14.010> same

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040 
think it's going to be exactly the same

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:17.780 
think it's going to be exactly the same
as<00:01:14.280> the<00:01:14.460> m8<00:01:15.140> we've<00:01:16.140> heard<00:01:16.350> some<00:01:16.650> rumors<00:01:17.460> that

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790 
as the m8 we've heard some rumors that

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:21.200 
as the m8 we've heard some rumors that
it<00:01:18.119> could<00:01:18.540> be<00:01:18.570> a<00:01:19.130> better<00:01:20.130> camera<00:01:20.460> set<00:01:20.880> like

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
it could be a better camera set like

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:24.020 
it could be a better camera set like
from<00:01:21.689> the<00:01:21.990> butterfly<00:01:22.650> J<00:01:23.250> which<00:01:23.549> we<00:01:23.700> see<00:01:23.850> that's

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
from the butterfly J which we see that's

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:25.460 
from the butterfly J which we see that's
going<00:01:24.150> to<00:01:24.210> be<00:01:24.330> getting<00:01:24.479> released<00:01:24.900> in<00:01:25.080> Japan

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
going to be getting released in Japan

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:30.050 
going to be getting released in Japan
which<00:01:26.189> has<00:01:26.369> a<00:01:26.400> 13-megapixel<00:01:28.220> duo<00:01:29.220> camera

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
which has a 13-megapixel duo camera

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:31.550 
which has a 13-megapixel duo camera
right<00:01:30.420> so<00:01:30.659> they're<00:01:30.810> going<00:01:30.930> to<00:01:31.020> bring<00:01:31.170> the<00:01:31.320> duo

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
right so they're going to bring the duo

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:33.649 
right so they're going to bring the duo
feature<00:01:31.920> with<00:01:32.189> a<00:01:32.220> higher<00:01:32.549> megapixel<00:01:33.240> camera

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:33.659 
feature with a higher megapixel camera

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:35.990 
feature with a higher megapixel camera
hopefully<00:01:34.619> it's<00:01:34.740> not<00:01:34.860> the<00:01:35.040> 13<00:01:35.400> megapixel

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
hopefully it's not the 13 megapixel

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.350 
hopefully it's not the 13 megapixel
sensor<00:01:36.299> that<00:01:36.450> we<00:01:36.570> find<00:01:36.869> in<00:01:36.990> the<00:01:37.079> HTC<00:01:37.650> one<00:01:37.920> mini

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:38.360 
sensor that we find in the HTC one mini

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:41.560 
sensor that we find in the HTC one mini
because<00:01:39.360> that<00:01:39.509> sensor<00:01:39.840> kind<00:01:40.020> of<00:01:40.110> sucks<00:01:40.460> but

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:41.570 
because that sensor kind of sucks but

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:43.880 
because that sensor kind of sucks but
we'll<00:01:42.570> look<00:01:42.720> and<00:01:42.899> see<00:01:42.990> what<00:01:43.110> happens<00:01:43.470> but<00:01:43.530> I

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
we'll look and see what happens but I

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:45.679 
we'll look and see what happens but I
want<00:01:44.549> to<00:01:44.610> know<00:01:44.670> what<00:01:44.790> you<00:01:44.909> guys<00:01:45.030> think<00:01:45.360> do<00:01:45.630> you

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:45.689 
want to know what you guys think do you

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:48.620 
want to know what you guys think do you

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
think it's going to take obviously we

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:50.749 
think it's going to take obviously we
know<00:01:48.720> about<00:01:48.840> the<00:01:49.110> apps<00:01:49.350> in<00:01:49.710> the<00:01:49.799> ecosystem<00:01:50.220> but

00:01:50.749 --> 00:01:50.759 
know about the apps in the ecosystem but

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:52.039 
know about the apps in the ecosystem but
what<00:01:50.909> do<00:01:51.000> you<00:01:51.060> think<00:01:51.240> it's<00:01:51.329> going<00:01:51.450> to<00:01:51.540> take<00:01:51.810> to

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030 
my particular case I think it's all

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:58.609 
my particular case I think it's all
about<00:01:57.180> hardware<00:01:57.689> I<00:01:57.869> know<00:01:58.049> no<00:01:58.320> key<00:01:58.500> has<00:01:58.590> been

00:01:58.609 --> 00:01:58.619 
about hardware I know no key has been

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:02.179 
about hardware I know no key has been
doing<00:01:59.009> amazing<00:01:59.219> things<00:01:59.880> with<00:02:00.979> hardware<00:02:01.979> from

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:02.189 
doing amazing things with hardware from

and that's going to help them push more

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:55.880 
and that's going to help them push more
units<00:02:52.680> that's<00:02:53.010> just<00:02:53.190> a<00:02:53.280> fact<00:02:53.780> so<00:02:54.780> all<00:02:55.050> i<00:02:55.590> had<00:02:55.770> to

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:55.890 
units that's just a fact so all i had to

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:57.650 
units that's just a fact so all i had to
call<00:02:56.070> it<00:02:56.160> the<00:02:56.220> samsung<00:02:56.730> model<00:02:56.970> they<00:02:57.270> just<00:02:57.450> push

00:02:57.650 --> 00:02:57.660 
call it the samsung model they just push

00:02:57.660 --> 00:02:59.750 
call it the samsung model they just push
out<00:02:58.080> and<00:02:58.380> you<00:02:58.800> can<00:02:58.980> see<00:02:59.220> it<00:02:59.340> so<00:02:59.580> I<00:02:59.610> think

00:02:59.750 --> 00:02:59.760 
out and you can see it so I think

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:01.430 
out and you can see it so I think
for<00:02:59.970> Windows<00:03:00.330> Phone<00:03:00.630> they<00:03:00.900> have<00:03:01.020> to<00:03:01.170> have<00:03:01.290> an

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:01.440 
for Windows Phone they have to have an

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:03.410 
for Windows Phone they have to have an
HTC<00:03:01.590> and<00:03:02.220> I<00:03:02.280> think<00:03:02.490> if<00:03:02.580> they<00:03:02.700> were<00:03:02.790> smart<00:03:02.970> they

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:03.420 
HTC and I think if they were smart they

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:05.000 
HTC and I think if they were smart they
were<00:03:03.480> smart<00:03:03.810> they<00:03:03.990> would<00:03:04.020> push<00:03:04.320> samsung<00:03:04.560> and

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:05.010 
were smart they would push samsung and

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:07.040 
were smart they would push samsung and
they<00:03:05.070> would<00:03:05.190> release<00:03:05.370> a<00:03:05.520> galaxy<00:03:06.000> s5<00:03:06.390> with

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:07.050 
they would release a galaxy s5 with

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:10.040 
they would release a galaxy s5 with
Windows<00:03:07.440> Phone<00:03:07.740> on<00:03:07.920> it<00:03:08.360> it<00:03:09.360> would<00:03:09.510> be<00:03:09.630> a<00:03:09.660> smart

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:10.050 
Windows Phone on it it would be a smart

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:13.010 
Windows Phone on it it would be a smart
