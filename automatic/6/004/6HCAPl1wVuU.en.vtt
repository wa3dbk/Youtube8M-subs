00:00:03.350 --> 00:00:07.830
 And then, you guys, my beauty is one more 

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:10.440
 video moxi but some things that I 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:13.139
 I received here is guzzi first collection 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:15.150
 So you're going to travel again and give 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:17.070
 the tip for you is the group masters games 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:19.320
 You'll find lots of cool things to 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:21.930
 you buy their games there site 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:23.460
 of the free market anyway always these 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:25.830
 tips are vague tips that you will 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:29.070
 get enough thing the good price né 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:31.140
 come on it was a blow here matters is 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:32.550
 that is on the table of the box will take 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:35.130
 hence 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:38.040
 some items are two of them at least for 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:41.100
 I lately do not think so in 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:44.579
 Nowhere to get the economy of 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:47.160
 video there are some of those here joseph 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:49.320
 two of them is the government is very 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:50.910
 hard to find mostly a 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:53.399
 them in good condition, right? 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:54.719
 since you will understand and one of these 

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:57.390
 more interesting items that will have 

00:00:54.719 --> 00:01:00.210
 still another video related to the subject 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:01.289
 I think it's a smart study. 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:03.719
 commented 

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:04.619
 and will make a video about it 

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:06.630
 also ne 

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:09.119
 but it is a first cycle of which are two 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:11.490
 years and I intend to show the 

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:14.369
 You two here are two cartridges. 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:15.869
 pirates is not to get you parallel in 

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:18.390
 but for quality if you put a 

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:19.439
 screw you dont you say he's a 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:21.479
 kitty, right? 

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:23.670
 the game of aladdin that he restored with 

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:25.680
 he painter with a special ink looks 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:28.290
 Just how cool is the law, I'm going to bed. 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:30.990
 very well printed probably made in 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:33.930
 a laser right 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:36.900
 Look, you just need the quality that the 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:39.000
 cartridge is very good, it's brand new 

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:41.490
 as if no one put a screw me 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:44.220
 see here you do not say you're a pirate and 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:49.590
 sergio aquino is certainly a second 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:50.369
 here some time ago someone with shadow 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:51.960
 huh 

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:53.700
 who does not know the game and later 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:56.520
 until I make an MP that shows you 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:58.920
 not playing really cool ebdon if not me 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:00.119
 cheating that he is a ninja in the game that 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:02.430
 It's cool, right? 

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:06.060
 I played a lot of myself but I want to bring 

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:07.590
 It is pretty cool too hard really cool 

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:09.240
 even one of the last ones that was behind 

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:10.289
 from a super nintendo collection now 

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:11.790
 missing a bit, right? 

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:14.550
 I already got aladim and the code-share 

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:17.640
 I was wanting now the lion king the 

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:20.070
 rock roll racing and left thinking more 

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:22.020
 something missing for my collection that I 

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:23.700
 I remember those two more head than 

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:26.510
 I need to pick up on my collection. 

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:29.430
 but the one that two more to waste time 

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:31.610
 greater for the others now implies that 

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:31.610
 huh 

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:41.880
 the first is the sport a pec 64 is yours 

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:43.830
 memory expansion card from 64 you 

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:45.810
 puts teaching and it improves 

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:48.360
 quality graphics games some games 

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:50.820
 require your team to run and for whom 

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:53.220
 do not know this here a card with 4 megs 

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:55.500
 of ram 64 olive you 

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:58.260
 put on it it will add that to 

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:59.280
 Ohio Video Game Leaving It Faster 

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:00.840
 the games are not 

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:03.450
 loading a little more texture with 

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:05.370
 the effects of some of the more details 

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:07.620
 it's a very difficult thing you could not 

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:10.380
 find it easily here whenever the 

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:12.299
 People think that just putting the knife is 

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:13.920
 have not sells and is an item 

00:03:12.299 --> 00:03:17.459
 essential for those who want the 

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:21.660
 nintendo 64 out of 64 and want to play 

00:03:17.459 --> 00:03:24.030
 some games like that when 64 is r 

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:25.739
 10 hours but that required 

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:27.570
 memory that is not a singer either. 

00:03:25.739 --> 00:03:28.410
 is not a memory card and ejected in the 

00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:30.930
 true, right? 

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:36.180
 Let's confuse things but finally 

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:41.040
 I managed to find mine and it's 64 and last. 

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:45.090
 the last item is the cushion control 

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:49.470
 has a Nintendo 64 controller and retail 

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:51.930
 people look at the logic of it connect without 

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:54.180
 No play, this was my logic. 

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:57.269
 It's a rare thing to find yourself today. 

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:59.310
 can find controls from 64 to 

00:03:57.269 --> 00:04:01.170
 sell bonuses that are in good logic here 

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:02.730
 because it here he wears with 

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:03.690
 time will be terrible 

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:05.850
 huh 

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:07.900
 and gained control of a fourth well 

00:04:05.850 --> 00:04:10.609
 kept well at the end 

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:13.430
 all the cool buttons and I now 

00:04:10.609 --> 00:04:16.370
 I can play my 107 rule my 

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:20.000
 64 husband in this control without the 

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:21.680
 analogue problem, but people 

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:25.430
 one more video but one blow but some 

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:28.220
 pressure control items of the 6 4 and 

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:30.229
 expands a beautiful pack and runs after 

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:33.110
 I returned to make a video about the 

00:04:30.229 --> 00:04:35.930
 expression pack about racism to english 

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:37.130
 console hardware is a written 

00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:39.169
 channel that commented 

00:04:37.130 --> 00:04:42.320
 she said ah well with the consoles 

00:04:39.169 --> 00:04:43.849
 They could have as we give an upgrade in 

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:46.009
 hardware is to increase memory 

00:04:43.849 --> 00:04:47.270
 something but to be able to extend the 

00:04:46.009 --> 00:04:49.520
 consoles lifetime 

00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:51.650
 nowadays they do not do more 

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:53.690
 they used to look already 

00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:56.180
 a great example in a flash a pack 

00:04:53.690 --> 00:04:58.699
 with 84 adding 4 megs of ram 

00:04:56.180 --> 00:05:00.199
 nowadays speaks with 4 gb of ram is only 

00:04:58.699 --> 00:05:02.030
 very little nowadays but in the 

00:05:00.199 --> 00:05:05.449
 when it made a difference 

00:05:02.030 --> 00:05:07.310
 you have no idea forum 34 sega 

00:05:05.449 --> 00:05:09.440
 saturn also that we had the cartridge 

00:05:07.310 --> 00:05:13.159
 passed from memory but it's already a subject for 

00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:14.630
 another video and here leave here two 

00:05:13.159 --> 00:05:18.259
 cartridges like I said my pressure 

00:05:14.630 --> 00:05:20.150
 with all super nintendo xandão and the game 

00:05:18.259 --> 00:05:22.550
 Aladdin is one of the best statesmen 

00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:23.680
 for the super nintendo but feels more 

00:05:22.550 --> 00:05:26.539
 video that you liked 

00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:28.659
 anything and until the next 

00:05:26.539 --> 00:05:28.659
 the people
