00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:05.990 

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:08.840 

here's<00:01:06.990> the<00:01:07.170> board<00:01:07.410> and<00:01:07.979> get<00:01:08.100> a<00:01:08.130> pile<00:01:08.400> of<00:01:08.430> dice

them on the starting space and what
you're<00:01:18.210> going<00:01:18.390> to<00:01:18.420> do<00:01:18.600> on<00:01:18.780> your<00:01:18.810> turn<00:01:19.170> is

you're going to do on your turn is
you're<00:01:19.860> going<00:01:20.009> to<00:01:20.070> move<00:01:20.220> forward<00:01:20.550> a<00:01:20.759> space<00:01:21.229> if

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:22.229 
you're going to move forward a space if

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:24.320 
you're going to move forward a space if
you<00:01:22.830> the<00:01:23.220> first<00:01:23.250> one<00:01:23.550> you<00:01:23.610> get<00:01:23.700> to<00:01:23.820> do<00:01:23.940> for<00:01:24.119> free

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.330 
you the first one you get to do for free

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:26.600 
you the first one you get to do for free
but<00:01:24.540> after<00:01:24.810> that<00:01:24.930> you<00:01:25.590> must<00:01:25.979> on<00:01:26.250> the<00:01:26.369> space

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610 
but after that you must on the space

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:28.040 
but after that you must on the space
you're<00:01:26.790> on<00:01:26.880> you<00:01:27.060> must<00:01:27.240> accomplish<00:01:27.570> the<00:01:27.720> goal

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:28.050 
you're on you must accomplish the goal

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:30.200 
you're on you must accomplish the goal
there<00:01:28.320> and<00:01:28.500> then<00:01:29.070> you<00:01:29.220> may<00:01:29.369> move<00:01:29.550> forward<00:01:30.000> one

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210 
there and then you may move forward one

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:32.300 
there and then you may move forward one
so<00:01:30.780> each<00:01:31.050> of<00:01:31.080> these<00:01:31.290> spaces<00:01:31.500> has<00:01:31.860> different

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310 
so each of these spaces has different

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:34.430 
so each of these spaces has different
things<00:01:32.490> now<00:01:33.060> most<00:01:33.330> of<00:01:33.479> the<00:01:33.540> many<00:01:33.960> spaces<00:01:34.229> on

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:34.440 
things now most of the many spaces on

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:37.550 
things now most of the many spaces on
the<00:01:34.530> board<00:01:34.560> or<00:01:34.950> draw<00:01:35.759> a<00:01:35.790> story<00:01:36.420> card<00:01:36.810> so<00:01:37.380> when

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
the board or draw a story card so when

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:39.800 
the board or draw a story card so when
that<00:01:37.740> happens<00:01:38.220> you<00:01:38.340> will<00:01:38.700> do<00:01:38.910> what<00:01:39.180> it<00:01:39.390> says

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810 
that happens you will do what it says

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:42.200 
that happens you will do what it says
and<00:01:39.990> you<00:01:40.140> will<00:01:40.320> draw<00:01:40.590> a<00:01:40.619> story<00:01:41.070> card<00:01:41.430> most<00:01:42.090> of

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.210 
and you will draw a story card most of

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:43.820 
and you will draw a story card most of
these<00:01:42.300> story<00:01:42.540> cards<00:01:42.869> or<00:01:43.259> all<00:01:43.380> of<00:01:43.500> them<00:01:43.650> have

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:43.830 
these story cards or all of them have

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:45.530 
these story cards or all of them have
some<00:01:44.040> kind<00:01:44.070> of<00:01:44.250> story<00:01:44.520> on<00:01:44.670> them<00:01:44.850> and<00:01:45.000> most<00:01:45.450> of

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:46.860 
them will say move forward one space

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:48.950 
them will say move forward one space
there<00:01:47.850> are<00:01:47.880> some<00:01:48.240> though<00:01:48.390> that<00:01:48.570> say<00:01:48.750> move

there are some though that say move
backwards<00:01:49.410> one<00:01:49.590> space<00:01:49.860> some<00:01:50.520> will<00:01:50.700> say<00:01:50.880> oh

next<00:02:26.760> turn<00:02:26.970> and<00:02:27.120> then<00:02:27.209> you<00:02:27.269> try<00:02:27.450> it<00:02:27.510> again<00:02:27.570> on

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:28.410 
next turn and then you try it again on

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:30.770 
next turn and then you try it again on
pink<00:02:28.920> purple<00:02:29.580> and<00:02:29.880> blue<00:02:30.120> you<00:02:30.150> only<00:02:30.390> need<00:02:30.570> three

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:30.780 
pink purple and blue you only need three

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:31.850 
pink purple and blue you only need three
of<00:02:30.840> the<00:02:30.900> dice<00:02:31.049> because<00:02:31.230> one<00:02:31.500> of<00:02:31.530> the<00:02:31.650> letters

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:31.860 
of the dice because one of the letters

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:33.949 
of the dice because one of the letters
is<00:02:31.980> already<00:02:32.220> on<00:02:32.310> the<00:02:32.400> board<00:02:32.580> for<00:02:33.299> example<00:02:33.390> here

00:02:33.949 --> 00:02:33.959 
is already on the board for example here

00:02:33.959 --> 00:02:36.410 
is already on the board for example here
in<00:02:34.080> the<00:02:34.470> pink<00:02:34.709> one<00:02:34.890> the<00:02:35.100> last<00:02:35.280> letter<00:02:35.880> here<00:02:36.239> is

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:36.420 
in the pink one the last letter here is

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:39.830 
in the pink one the last letter here is
T<00:02:36.810> and<00:02:37.140> so<00:02:38.040> you<00:02:38.580> have<00:02:38.760> to<00:02:38.880> find<00:02:39.090> some<00:02:39.450> way<00:02:39.600> that

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:39.840 
T and so you have to find some way that

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:45.229 
T and so you have to find some way that
you<00:02:40.019> can<00:02:40.230> make<00:02:40.470> T<00:02:40.769> so<00:02:41.010> I<00:02:41.040> could<00:02:41.340> say<00:02:41.549> m<00:02:41.850> i<00:02:44.239> st

00:02:45.229 --> 00:02:45.239 
you can make T so I could say m i st

00:02:45.239 --> 00:02:47.449 
you can make T so I could say m i st
missed<00:02:45.690> and<00:02:46.080> then<00:02:46.650> i<00:02:46.709> can<00:02:46.890> move<00:02:47.040> forward<00:02:47.340> to

00:02:47.449 --> 00:02:47.459 
missed and then i can move forward to

00:02:47.459 --> 00:02:49.220 
missed and then i can move forward to
the<00:02:47.519> next<00:02:47.790> spot<00:02:48.000> so<00:02:48.510> you<00:02:48.570> will<00:02:48.810> keep<00:02:48.989> rolling

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:49.230 
the next spot so you will keep rolling

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:50.870 
the next spot so you will keep rolling
letters<00:02:49.590> here<00:02:49.890> or<00:02:50.340> spinning<00:02:50.730> the<00:02:50.820> spinner

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:50.880 
letters here or spinning the spinner

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:53.330 
letters here or spinning the spinner
until<00:02:51.660> you<00:02:51.750> move<00:02:51.900> on<00:02:52.140> when<00:02:52.890> you<00:02:52.980> get<00:02:53.070> up<00:02:53.190> here

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:53.340 
until you move on when you get up here

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:55.670 
until you move on when you get up here
to<00:02:53.489> the<00:02:53.640> bag<00:02:53.880> of<00:02:54.090> numbers<00:02:54.480> here<00:02:55.260> you<00:02:55.320> roll

00:05:06.159 --> 00:05:06.169 
winning spot and then the game is over I

00:05:06.169 --> 00:05:09.110 
winning spot and then the game is over I
think<00:05:07.169> I<00:05:07.440> could<00:05:07.590> say<00:05:07.740> with<00:05:07.919> 100%<00:05:08.550> certainty

00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:09.120 
think I could say with 100% certainty

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:12.710 
think I could say with 100% certainty
that<00:05:09.510> this<00:05:10.229> game<00:05:10.530> is<00:05:10.770> not<00:05:11.010> geared<00:05:11.610> towards<00:05:11.940> me

00:05:12.710 --> 00:05:12.720 
that this game is not geared towards me

00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:14.750 
that this game is not geared towards me
not<00:05:12.810> even<00:05:13.110> remotely<00:05:13.830> the<00:05:14.130> questions<00:05:14.580> weren't

00:05:14.750 --> 00:05:14.760 
not even remotely the questions weren't

00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:16.520 
not even remotely the questions weren't
geared<00:05:15.030> towards<00:05:15.330> me<00:05:15.480> I<00:05:15.750> couldn't<00:05:16.290> stand<00:05:16.410> the

00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:16.530 
geared towards me I couldn't stand the

00:05:16.530 --> 00:05:18.230 
geared towards me I couldn't stand the
fact<00:05:16.770> that<00:05:16.860> you<00:05:16.980> turned<00:05:17.430> a<00:05:17.610> card<00:05:17.850> over<00:05:18.090> and<00:05:18.180> it

00:05:18.230 --> 00:05:18.240 
fact that you turned a card over and it

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:19.670 
fact that you turned a card over and it
told<00:05:18.390> you<00:05:18.510> to<00:05:18.630> go<00:05:18.750> forward<00:05:18.990> or<00:05:19.170> backwards<00:05:19.530> one

00:05:19.670 --> 00:05:19.680 
told you to go forward or backwards one

00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:21.830 
told you to go forward or backwards one
and<00:05:19.890> I<00:05:20.490> mean<00:05:20.910> I<00:05:20.940> did<00:05:21.090> like<00:05:21.360> the<00:05:21.540> rolling<00:05:21.780> the

00:05:21.830 --> 00:05:21.840 
and I mean I did like the rolling the

00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:23.060 
and I mean I did like the rolling the
dice<00:05:21.990> and<00:05:22.140> making<00:05:22.380> it<00:05:22.470> word<00:05:22.590> that<00:05:22.830> part<00:05:23.040> that

00:05:23.060 --> 00:05:23.070 
dice and making it word that part that

00:05:23.070 --> 00:05:25.040 
dice and making it word that part that
was<00:05:23.220> name<00:05:23.490> but<00:05:23.700> it's<00:05:23.970> not<00:05:24.240> geared<00:05:24.540> towards<00:05:24.900> me

00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:25.050 
was name but it's not geared towards me

00:05:25.050 --> 00:05:27.470 
was name but it's not geared towards me
so<00:05:25.290> my<00:05:25.410> opinion<00:05:25.860> doesn't<00:05:26.310> matter<00:05:26.670> let's<00:05:27.210> check

00:05:27.470 --> 00:05:27.480 
so my opinion doesn't matter let's check

00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:30.290 
so my opinion doesn't matter let's check
with<00:05:27.600> the<00:05:27.720> kids<00:05:27.960> what<00:05:28.500> did<00:05:28.590> you<00:05:28.710> think<00:05:28.920> I<00:05:29.300> like
