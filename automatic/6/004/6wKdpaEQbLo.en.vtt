another<00:00:01.290> technique<00:00:01.680> for<00:00:01.740> applying

00:00:02.389 --> 00:00:02.399 
another technique for applying

00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:04.579 
another technique for applying
watercolor<00:00:03.120> paint<00:00:03.449> is<00:00:03.570> called<00:00:03.780> stippling<00:00:04.200> I

00:00:04.579 --> 00:00:04.589 
watercolor paint is called stippling I

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:07.010 
watercolor paint is called stippling I
could<00:00:05.279> stipple<00:00:05.700> by<00:00:05.790> using<00:00:06.089> a<00:00:06.299> small<00:00:06.540> brush<00:00:06.690> and

00:00:07.010 --> 00:00:07.020 
could stipple by using a small brush and

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:08.540 
could stipple by using a small brush and
putting<00:00:07.230> lots<00:00:07.529> of<00:00:07.620> little<00:00:07.799> dots<00:00:07.980> on<00:00:08.220> there<00:00:08.400> but

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:08.550 
putting lots of little dots on there but

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:10.520 
putting lots of little dots on there but
that<00:00:08.670> gets<00:00:08.760> a<00:00:08.880> little<00:00:09.059> tedious<00:00:09.330> so<00:00:10.230> I<00:00:10.260> can

00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:10.530 
that gets a little tedious so I can

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:13.879 
that gets a little tedious so I can
actually<00:00:10.679> use<00:00:11.280> stiff<00:00:12.210> bristle<00:00:12.660> brushes<00:00:13.080> to

00:00:13.879 --> 00:00:13.889 
actually use stiff bristle brushes to

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:16.310 
actually use stiff bristle brushes to
splatter<00:00:14.790> the<00:00:15.089> paint<00:00:15.120> on<00:00:15.599> a<00:00:15.630> lot<00:00:15.900> of<00:00:15.929> times<00:00:16.170> you

00:00:16.310 --> 00:00:16.320 
splatter the paint on a lot of times you

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:18.410 
splatter the paint on a lot of times you
see<00:00:16.710> this<00:00:16.890> called<00:00:17.130> splattering<00:00:17.609> in<00:00:17.910> other

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:18.420 
see this called splattering in other

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:20.240 
see this called splattering in other
books<00:00:18.779> and<00:00:18.990> things<00:00:19.260> so<00:00:19.770> I've<00:00:19.830> got<00:00:19.949> a<00:00:19.980> variety

you can go and you know buy a brush
specifically<00:00:31.890> for<00:00:32.160> this<00:00:32.399> I<00:00:32.579> also<00:00:33.149> have<00:00:33.559> three

00:00:34.549 --> 00:00:34.559 
specifically for this I also have three

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:37.130 
specifically for this I also have three
different<00:00:34.710> sizes<00:00:34.980> of<00:00:35.489> white<00:00:36.390> nylon<00:00:36.870> brushes

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.140 
different sizes of white nylon brushes

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:38.959 
different sizes of white nylon brushes
they're<00:00:37.590> no<00:00:37.710> longer<00:00:37.829> white<00:00:38.190> because<00:00:38.610> of<00:00:38.820> the

00:00:38.959 --> 00:00:38.969 
they're no longer white because of the

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:40.639 
they're no longer white because of the
watercolor<00:00:39.210> paint<00:00:39.629> that<00:00:39.780> I<00:00:39.809> use<00:00:40.140> and<00:00:40.440> it

00:00:40.639 --> 00:00:40.649 
watercolor paint that I use and it

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:43.010 
watercolor paint that I use and it
stains<00:00:41.100> it<00:00:41.309> but<00:00:41.460> it's<00:00:41.579> not<00:00:41.670> a<00:00:41.700> big<00:00:41.940> deal<00:00:42.180> so<00:00:42.930> at

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.020 
stains it but it's not a big deal so at

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:44.540 
stains it but it's not a big deal so at
three<00:00:43.170> different<00:00:43.469> sizes<00:00:43.649> will<00:00:44.040> actually<00:00:44.309> give

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
three different sizes will actually give

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:45.979 
three different sizes will actually give
me<00:00:44.760> three<00:00:45.059> different<00:00:45.180> effects<00:00:45.690> three

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
me three different effects three

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:48.290 
me three different effects three
different<00:00:46.320> splatter<00:00:47.070> patterns<00:00:47.610> so<00:00:48.090> I'm<00:00:48.149> going

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300 
different splatter patterns so I'm going

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:51.189 
different splatter patterns so I'm going
to<00:00:48.390> use<00:00:48.510> all<00:00:48.719> four<00:00:49.200> of<00:00:49.500> these<00:00:49.739> brushes<00:00:50.129> to

00:00:51.189 --> 00:00:51.199 
to use all four of these brushes to

00:00:51.199 --> 00:00:55.069 
to use all four of these brushes to
start<00:00:52.199> applying<00:00:53.039> the<00:00:53.399> paint<00:00:53.840> without<00:00:54.840> ever

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079 
start applying the paint without ever

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:57.500 
start applying the paint without ever

now<00:03:06.810> my<00:03:06.990> smaller<00:03:07.260> brushes<00:03:07.560> I<00:03:07.920> can<00:03:08.610> do<00:03:08.700> the<00:03:08.790> same

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:09.000 
now my smaller brushes I can do the same

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:13.010 
now my smaller brushes I can do the same
thing<00:03:09.290> the<00:03:10.290> shorter<00:03:10.590> the<00:03:10.710> bristles<00:03:11.930> sort<00:03:12.930> of

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:13.020 
thing the shorter the bristles sort of

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:15.020 
thing the shorter the bristles sort of
the<00:03:13.110> finer<00:03:13.410> the<00:03:13.530> mist<00:03:13.950> of<00:03:14.190> paint<00:03:14.460> that<00:03:14.700> it<00:03:14.880> will

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:15.030 
the finer the mist of paint that it will

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:16.990 
the finer the mist of paint that it will
actually<00:03:15.780> splatter

00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:17.000 
actually splatter

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:21.620 
actually splatter
and<00:03:18.830> the<00:03:19.830> less<00:03:20.010> water<00:03:20.280> I<00:03:20.430> have<00:03:20.760> the<00:03:21.120> finer<00:03:21.390> the

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:21.630 
and the less water I have the finer the

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:27.320 
and the less water I have the finer the
mist<00:03:24.500> so<00:03:25.500> this<00:03:25.740> kind<00:03:25.980> of<00:03:26.070> spiders<00:03:26.490> it<00:03:26.670> in<00:03:26.880> a

00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:27.330 
mist so this kind of spiders it in a

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:32.000 
mist so this kind of spiders it in a
smaller<00:03:27.810> area<00:03:30.350> so<00:03:31.350> I<00:03:31.380> have<00:03:31.530> to<00:03:31.620> kind<00:03:31.800> of<00:03:31.830> move

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:32.010 
smaller area so I have to kind of move

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:36.920 
smaller area so I have to kind of move
it<00:03:32.130> around<00:03:32.220> a<00:03:32.550> lot<00:03:32.670> more<00:03:35.420> okay<00:03:36.420> and<00:03:36.690> then

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:36.930 
it around a lot more okay and then

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:39.770 
it around a lot more okay and then
finally<00:03:37.350> my<00:03:37.470> little<00:03:37.770> teeny<00:03:37.950> tiny<00:03:38.190> brush<00:03:38.520> I<00:03:38.850> can

00:03:39.770 --> 00:03:39.780
