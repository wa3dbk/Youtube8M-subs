sims in SimCity fight and when you do

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:41.030 
sims in SimCity fight and when you do
build<00:00:38.790> your<00:00:39.180> initial<00:00:39.510> city<00:00:39.780> you'll<00:00:40.710> notice

that<00:00:41.219> the<00:00:41.399> water<00:00:41.610> is<00:00:42.030> actually<00:00:42.690> a<00:00:42.719> resource

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:43.230 
that the water is actually a resource

that the water is actually a resource
and<00:00:43.649> you<00:00:44.219> will<00:00:44.399> deplete<00:00:44.760> it<00:00:44.969> just<00:00:45.180> like<00:00:45.390> coal

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750 
and you will deplete it just like coal

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:50.900 
and you will deplete it just like coal
oil<00:00:46.070> or<00:00:47.239> oil<00:00:48.239> and<00:00:48.680> alloys<00:00:49.680> and<00:00:50.010> once<00:00:50.280> it's<00:00:50.640> gone

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
stumbled across the solution that's kind

it sewage outflow pipe it can no longer
take<00:01:09.780> any<00:01:10.020> in<00:01:10.229> you're<00:01:10.470> gonna<00:01:10.560> have<00:01:10.799> to<00:01:10.920> upgrade

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
to the sewage treatment plant when you

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:14.810 
to the sewage treatment plant when you
finally<00:01:13.560> get<00:01:13.710> the<00:01:13.830> cash<00:01:14.040> this<00:01:14.369> is<00:01:14.520> a<00:01:14.549> good

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 
treatment plant and what it does is it

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:20.929 
treatment plant and what it does is it
takes<00:01:19.200> in<00:01:19.380> the<00:01:19.500> sewage<00:01:19.860> processes<00:01:20.640> it<00:01:20.790> and

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:20.939 
takes in the sewage processes it and

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:24.109 
takes in the sewage processes it and
then<00:01:21.060> puts<00:01:21.540> out<00:01:21.720> water<00:01:21.750> yep<00:01:22.710> and<00:01:22.880> so<00:01:23.880> right

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:24.119 
then puts out water yep and so right

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:26.240 
then puts out water yep and so right
here<00:01:24.150> this<00:01:24.479> dark<00:01:24.990> blue<00:01:25.259> area<00:01:25.590> this<00:01:25.830> actually

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
here this dark blue area this actually

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:28.370 
here this dark blue area this actually
wasn't<00:01:26.640> there<00:01:26.909> when<00:01:27.119> I<00:01:27.180> started<00:01:27.720> there<00:01:28.259> was

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
wasn't there when I started there was

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:31.010 
wasn't there when I started there was
only<00:01:28.619> a<00:01:28.650> little<00:01:28.860> water<00:01:29.329> available<00:01:30.329> and<00:01:30.540> then<00:01:30.990> I

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
only a little water available and then I

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:33.800 
only a little water available and then I
noticed<00:01:31.439> that<00:01:31.500> maybe<00:01:31.979> I'm<00:01:32.640> not<00:01:32.850> sure<00:01:33.150> but<00:01:33.659> it

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810 
noticed that maybe I'm not sure but it

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:36.499 
noticed that maybe I'm not sure but it
seemed<00:01:34.140> like<00:01:34.229> I<00:01:34.560> had<00:01:34.770> initially<00:01:35.009> built<00:01:35.509> my

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:36.509 
seemed like I had initially built my

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:38.539 
seemed like I had initially built my
water<00:01:36.780> well<00:01:37.200> let<00:01:37.409> me<00:01:37.500> talk<00:01:37.680> about<00:01:37.710> that<00:01:37.950> before

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:38.549 
water well let me talk about that before

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:40.940 
water well let me talk about that before
we<00:01:38.640> go<00:01:38.790> so<00:01:39.240> then<00:01:39.420> what<00:01:39.630> you<00:01:39.720> do<00:01:39.869> is<00:01:40.049> you<00:01:40.619> build<00:01:40.770> a

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
we go so then what you do is you build a

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:44.270 
we go so then what you do is you build a
water<00:01:41.250> pumping<00:01:41.970> station<00:01:42.030> and<00:01:42.780> you<00:01:43.770> put<00:01:44.009> it<00:01:44.100> as

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
water pumping station and you put it as

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:46.730 
water pumping station and you put it as
close<00:01:44.729> as<00:01:44.759> possible<00:01:45.060> to<00:01:45.869> your<00:01:46.380> sewage

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740 
close as possible to your sewage

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:48.740 
close as possible to your sewage
treatment<00:01:47.009> plan<00:01:47.460> and<00:01:47.700> that's<00:01:48.390> what<00:01:48.570> I<00:01:48.600> was

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:48.750 
treatment plan and that's what I was

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:50.420 
treatment plan and that's what I was
talking<00:01:49.020> about<00:01:49.079> before<00:01:49.320> I<00:01:49.530> had<00:01:49.710> initially<00:01:49.979> put

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:50.430 
talking about before I had initially put

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:52.120 
talking about before I had initially put
it<00:01:50.520> up<00:01:50.670> here<00:01:50.909> but<00:01:51.090> maybe<00:01:51.299> through<00:01:51.689> the

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:52.130 
it up here but maybe through the

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:55.130 
it up here but maybe through the
topography<00:01:53.130> the<00:01:53.700> water<00:01:54.329> had<00:01:54.600> seemed<00:01:54.899> to<00:01:55.020> be

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:55.140 
topography the water had seemed to be

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:57.889 
topography the water had seemed to be
pulling<00:01:55.409> down<00:01:55.860> in<00:01:56.070> here<00:01:56.460> so<00:01:57.000> initially<00:01:57.570> I

00:01:57.889 --> 00:01:57.899 
pulling down in here so initially I

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:00.980 
pulling down in here so initially I
moved<00:01:58.890> my<00:01:59.610> plant<00:01:59.939> from<00:02:00.149> there<00:02:00.360> to<00:02:00.509> there<00:02:00.630> I<00:02:00.689> had

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:00.990 
moved my plant from there to there I had

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:03.319 
moved my plant from there to there I had
some<00:02:01.170> money<00:02:01.290> to<00:02:01.530> burn<00:02:01.740> and<00:02:02.040> moved<00:02:02.969> it<00:02:03.119> over

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:03.329 
some money to burn and moved it over

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:05.240 
some money to burn and moved it over
there<00:02:03.509> as<00:02:03.689> you<00:02:04.140> can<00:02:04.290> see<00:02:04.500> over<00:02:04.649> time<00:02:05.009> it<00:02:05.219> really

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:05.250 
there as you can see over time it really

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:08.300 
there as you can see over time it really
didn't<00:02:05.700> matter<00:02:05.880> because<00:02:06.180> it<00:02:06.829> it<00:02:07.829> filled<00:02:08.160> in

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:08.310 
didn't matter because it it filled in

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:10.249 
didn't matter because it it filled in
that<00:02:08.399> area<00:02:08.819> nicely<00:02:09.239> but<00:02:09.390> it<00:02:09.539> did<00:02:09.690> leave<00:02:10.050> me

00:02:10.249 --> 00:02:10.259 
that area nicely but it did leave me

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:12.600 
that area nicely but it did leave me
more<00:02:10.500> room<00:02:10.800> to<00:02:11.129> build<00:02:11.430> stuff

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:12.610 
more room to build stuff

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:16.380 
more room to build stuff
to<00:02:12.730> the<00:02:12.820> north<00:02:13.080> so<00:02:14.080> anyway<00:02:15.010> so<00:02:15.910> that's<00:02:16.090> it

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:16.390 
to the north so anyway so that's it

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:18.360 
to the north so anyway so that's it
that's<00:02:16.690> all<00:02:16.990> you<00:02:17.020> do<00:02:17.350> you'd<00:02:17.560> build<00:02:17.830> the<00:02:17.980> water

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:18.370 
that's all you do you'd build the water

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:21.840 
that's all you do you'd build the water
treatment<00:02:18.700> plant<00:02:18.970> and<00:02:19.540> a<00:02:20.640> sewage<00:02:21.640> treatment

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:21.850 
treatment plant and a sewage treatment

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:23.730 
treatment plant and a sewage treatment
plant<00:02:22.270> and<00:02:22.450> then<00:02:22.600> you<00:02:22.720> add<00:02:22.870> the<00:02:23.110> water<00:02:23.290> pumping

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:23.740 
plant and then you add the water pumping

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:25.680 
plant and then you add the water pumping
station<00:02:23.800> next<00:02:24.430> to<00:02:24.520> it<00:02:24.640> and<00:02:24.820> then<00:02:25.390> you<00:02:25.510> have<00:02:25.660> a

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:25.690 
station next to it and then you have a

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:27.450 
station next to it and then you have a
endless<00:02:26.260> supply<00:02:26.590> of<00:02:26.620> water<00:02:26.860> and<00:02:27.100> you're

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:27.460 
endless supply of water and you're

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:30.330 
endless supply of water and you're
probably<00:02:27.610> wondering<00:02:27.820> well<00:02:28.830> it<00:02:29.830> must<00:02:30.130> be

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:30.340 
probably wondering well it must be

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:33.000 
probably wondering well it must be
filthy<00:02:31.060> you<00:02:31.390> know<00:02:31.510> it<00:02:31.600> must<00:02:31.720> be<00:02:31.900> dirty<00:02:32.140> I'm<00:02:32.680> not

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:33.010 
filthy you know it must be dirty I'm not

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:34.890 
filthy you know it must be dirty I'm not
doing<00:02:33.340> anything<00:02:33.610> this<00:02:33.910> isn't<00:02:34.300> any<00:02:34.480> water

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:34.900 
doing anything this isn't any water

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:37.740 
doing anything this isn't any water
treatment<00:02:35.530> I<00:02:35.680> don't<00:02:35.860> it's<00:02:36.100> just<00:02:36.220> I<00:02:36.610> don't<00:02:37.600> have

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:37.750 
treatment I don't it's just I don't have

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:39.630 
treatment I don't it's just I don't have
any<00:02:37.930> of<00:02:38.200> those<00:02:38.350> things<00:02:38.410> built<00:02:38.950> but<00:02:39.430> if<00:02:39.550> you

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:39.640 
any of those things built but if you

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:41.730 
any of those things built but if you
come<00:02:39.790> over<00:02:39.940> here<00:02:40.180> and<00:02:40.240> you<00:02:40.330> look<00:02:40.510> there's<00:02:41.350> the

come over here and you look there's the

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:43.660 
pollution level there's the high end

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:45.540 
pollution level there's the high end
there's<00:02:43.930> the<00:02:44.080> low<00:02:44.260> end<00:02:44.500> it's<00:02:44.770> as<00:02:44.980> low<00:02:45.310> as

there's the low end it's as low as

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:47.470 
possible it's as low as you can get I

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:49.320 
possible it's as low as you can get I
don't<00:02:47.980> have<00:02:48.130> any<00:02:48.370> factories<00:02:49.000> or<00:02:49.150> anything

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:49.330 
don't have any factories or anything

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:52.410 
don't have any factories or anything
near<00:02:49.690> this<00:02:49.930> station<00:02:50.860> so<00:02:51.209> that's<00:02:52.209> not

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:52.420 
near this station so that's not

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:54.720 
near this station so that's not
contributing<00:02:52.989> to<00:02:53.020> put<00:02:53.170> the<00:02:53.290> sewer<00:02:53.500> water<00:02:53.830> once

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:54.730 
contributing to put the sewer water once

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:57.449 
contributing to put the sewer water once
it's<00:02:54.940> treated<00:02:55.330> is<00:02:55.650> 100%<00:02:56.650> clean<00:02:56.890> I<00:02:56.920> guess

00:02:57.449 --> 00:02:57.459 
it's treated is 100% clean I guess

00:02:57.459 --> 00:02:59.670 
it's treated is 100% clean I guess
