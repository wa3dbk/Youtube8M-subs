00:00:16.219 --> 00:00:21.619
 saucer and his comments 

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:25.860

00:00:21.619 --> 00:00:29.610

 and some ability to put the seeds 

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:52.540
 then if you did not get the 

00:00:49.989 --> 00:00:55.090
 peeled almonds you can put them in 

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:57.270
 hot water to be able to peel them 

00:00:55.090 --> 00:01:00.050
 easily 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:03.810
 once the almonds are soaked 

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:05.440
 we proceed to peel them is done with 

00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:09.370
 ease 

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:11.830
 and we put them on the canvas to be 

00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:15.840
 dry 

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:15.840
 and we can split them 

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:26.720
 if the equals do not get them that from 

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:30.259
 security as it is very easy to do not 

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:32.540
 they should only be fresh so that 

00:01:30.259 --> 00:01:36.190
 you can take out the seed 

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:39.640
 and not break the skin 

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:43.450
 when you have finished after all 

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:45.040
 We put the plums in the wine 

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:48.240
 White 

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:54.090
 this is to lower it a little 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:54.090
 so much sugar arrived condensed milk 

00:01:56.909 --> 00:02:00.689
 delete your website 

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:06.410
 Y 

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:18.190
 we are also going to proceed to chop the 

00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:18.190
 almond and we already discovered dry 

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:30.890
 now to put it side 

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:30.890
 condensed milk to make a mixture 

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:38.910
 with the nut and with the almond 

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:49.390
 we make it envelope 

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:54.630
 to be noticed 

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:54.630
 the pieces of the seeds 

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:09.680
 and this will serve to fill 

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:14.790
 the raisins we already have 

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:20.990
 previously drained 

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:20.990
 ah 

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:31.830
 the wine or serve to remove to lower 

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:34.740
 a little the sugar of the mixture 

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:38.960
 the sweet fruit the sweet mixture and apart 

00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:38.960
 of the food is total 

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:42.659
 it is placed in the fields 

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:50.710
 that 

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:50.710
 but also a little bit of acidity 

00:04:00.770 --> 00:04:06.090
 plus 

00:04:03.069 --> 00:04:06.090
 and almonds 

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:15.840
 what can we do with white quotes 

00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:19.040
 the alternative paper we can not do it 

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:19.040
 with a muscovado sugar 

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:25.370
 another option would be to have a 

00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:29.800
 mixture which has 

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:29.800
 Well, it has almonds 

00:04:40.689 --> 00:04:48.219
 this is another quick recipe for a post 

00:04:45.269 --> 00:04:50.080
 Take the ingredients are chocolate 

00:04:48.219 --> 00:04:52.810
 for pastry 

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:57.120
 and cherries and we also need 

00:04:52.810 --> 00:04:59.699
 ability to place cherries 

00:04:57.120 --> 00:05:02.130
 chocolate for pastry is placed 

00:04:59.699 --> 00:05:06.639
 in a container that we are going to put 

00:05:02.130 --> 00:05:09.909
 bain- marie to dissolve 

00:05:06.639 --> 00:05:12.430
 to melt it better and to be able to 

00:05:09.909 --> 00:05:15.099
 use chocolate for pastry 

00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:18.400
 it can be sliced ​​like that though 

00:05:15.099 --> 00:05:21.490
 they sell one that is for ice cream but that 

00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:23.560
 it's a little more bait 

00:05:21.490 --> 00:05:26.469
 once we put the chocolate melt 

00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:28.719
 while we have to put the cherries to 

00:05:26.469 --> 00:05:32.860
 drain is very important to remove the 

00:05:28.719 --> 00:05:34.870
 syrup the syrup begins to cut it goes 

00:05:32.860 --> 00:05:37.990
 to react with the chocolate then 

00:05:34.870 --> 00:05:40.750
 afterwards it will not dry well it is also 

00:05:37.990 --> 00:05:44.580
 important that cherries have this 

00:05:40.750 --> 00:05:46.719
 detail because we are going with this we are going to 

00:05:44.580 --> 00:05:48.330
 use them to put the action on 

00:05:46.719 --> 00:05:51.590
 chocolate 

00:05:48.330 --> 00:05:54.800
 the chocolate is then the 

00:05:51.590 --> 00:05:54.800
 procedure is 

00:05:55.750 --> 00:05:59.130
 and put the cherry 

00:05:59.540 --> 00:06:05.800
 and take it to one side and another 

00:06:01.990 --> 00:06:08.800
 let them cover perfectly 

00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:11.879
 never take hallway 

00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:11.879
 and place it 

00:06:12.340 --> 00:06:17.850
 we repeat the operation spears gone and 

00:06:14.980 --> 00:06:17.850
 return 

00:06:18.190 --> 00:06:24.160
 discover 

00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:24.160
 and place in the capacity 

00:06:25.510 --> 00:06:30.580
 the wick must be quite long but 

00:06:28.780 --> 00:06:33.650
 if it is short equal nothing else that we 

00:06:30.580 --> 00:06:36.160
