how<00:01:30.960> I<00:01:30.990> did<00:01:31.259> the<00:01:31.979> teleport<00:01:32.400> effects<00:01:32.700> when<00:01:32.909> the

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
how I did the teleport effects when the

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:38.600 
how I did the teleport effects when the
camera<00:01:33.329> was<00:01:33.450> moving<00:01:35.390> well<00:01:36.530> what<00:01:37.530> we<00:01:37.650> did<00:01:37.829> is<00:01:38.070> uh

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610 
camera was moving well what we did is uh

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:41.569 
camera was moving well what we did is uh
I<00:01:39.060> can't<00:01:39.780> with<00:01:39.900> an<00:01:39.990> idea<00:01:40.229> where<00:01:40.409> I<00:01:40.590> set<00:01:41.159> because

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:41.579 
I can't with an idea where I set because

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:43.819 
I can't with an idea where I set because
Amla<00:01:42.000> sees<00:01:42.240> so<00:01:42.450> this<00:01:42.600> this<00:01:43.079> axis<00:01:43.649> right<00:01:43.770> here

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:43.829 
Amla sees so this this axis right here

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:46.700 
Amla sees so this this axis right here
this<00:01:44.549> joystick<00:01:45.060> controls<00:01:45.960> this<00:01:46.380> way<00:01:46.560> right

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:46.710 
this joystick controls this way right

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:48.350 
this joystick controls this way right
here<00:01:46.920> and<00:01:47.100> then<00:01:47.729> this<00:01:47.850> one<00:01:48.030> right<00:01:48.060> here<00:01:48.270> you

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:48.360 
here and then this one right here you

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:49.999 
here and then this one right here you

00:02:26.099 --> 00:02:26.109 
you don't want them to disappear and so

00:02:26.109 --> 00:02:27.330 
you don't want them to disappear and so
they're<00:02:26.230> going<00:02:26.319> to<00:02:26.409> move<00:02:26.530> or<00:02:26.739> something<00:02:27.159> and

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:27.340 
they're going to move or something and

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:30.270 
they're going to move or something and
so<00:02:27.909> then<00:02:28.060> what<00:02:28.239> you'll<00:02:28.390> do<00:02:28.540> is<00:02:28.689> go<00:02:28.750> in<00:02:29.049> is<00:02:29.560> right

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:30.280 
so then what you'll do is go in is right

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:32.069 
so then what you'll do is go in is right
after<00:02:30.640> that<00:02:30.790> have<00:02:31.299> the<00:02:31.450> exact<00:02:31.659> same<00:02:31.689> thing

00:02:32.069 --> 00:02:32.079 
after that have the exact same thing

00:02:32.079 --> 00:02:33.750 
after that have the exact same thing
shoot<00:02:32.349> it<00:02:32.470> exactly<00:02:32.950> like<00:02:33.129> you<00:02:33.250> just<00:02:33.400> did<00:02:33.549> again

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:33.760 
shoot it exactly like you just did again

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:36.690

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:36.700 
very slow without the after there so

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:38.089 
very slow without the after there so
what's<00:02:36.879> going<00:02:37.000> to<00:02:37.030> do<00:02:37.150> is<00:02:37.239> right<00:02:37.420> in<00:02:37.540> between

00:02:38.089 --> 00:02:38.099 
what's going to do is right in between

00:02:38.099 --> 00:02:40.440 
what's going to do is right in between
