00:00:08.159 --> 00:00:13.319
 Marcos Baghdatis from Cyprus was not only clear on paper 

00:00:13.319 --> 00:00:17.879
 Favorite went first content final of the BMW Open by 11 EU Aldi 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:19.360
 they go 

00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:23.510
 the last German in the field Philipp Kohlschreiber 30 places in the 

00:00:23.510 --> 00:00:26.130
 World ranking are between the two 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:28.579
 and Philipp Kohlschreiber he fought here 

00:00:28.579 --> 00:00:34.109
 cited his entry into his first crack finale on the time clock while Baghdad is on 

00:00:34.109 --> 00:00:37.239
 this year already a tournament the bees do not give the group 

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:43.200
 under his big star he already went on a past year as he did 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:48.120
 completely surprisingly at the Austrian Open the final had reached 

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:54.980
 The first match of the two against each other already fought hard 

00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:57.320
 completed ten minutes 

00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:01.050
 Many breakballs already have many balls for Kohlschreiber for 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:03.850
 fatal this but somehow you had the impression 

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:05.620
 neither wanted 

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:07.760
 close the bag 

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:11.610
 the center court on the MTTC Iphitos plant almost sold out 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:16.170
 Iron bender Vinzelberg left 

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:19.010
 like actually 

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:22.170
 on all days he is another first 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:25.550
 Break ball 

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:28.030
 for Philipp Kohlschreiber 

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:31.990
 Beyer here is something of a home game has been born in Augsburg 

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:32.960
 Oberhaching 

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:35.960
 the Bundeswehr is trained there 

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:07.800
 Parts of Speck by Philipp Kohlschreiber still help 

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:10.249
 Lucerne is clearly a field 

00:02:10.249 --> 00:02:13.249
 the Fed, he had imagined 

00:02:17.329 --> 00:02:22.150
 Facility or on the center court which, of course, primarily in 

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:25.099
 German here and roll 

00:02:25.099 --> 00:02:29.260
 He continued to do so Philipp Kohlschreiber then led quickly with 5 

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:30.549
 to 2 

00:02:30.549 --> 00:02:32.799
 and had at 40 15 

00:02:32.799 --> 00:02:35.799
 two sentence balls who would have thought that 

00:02:42.719 --> 00:02:45.189
 a very clear since she 

00:02:45.189 --> 00:02:47.039
 Opportunity of SC through 

00:02:47.039 --> 00:02:48.439
 one with six to two 

00:02:48.439 --> 00:02:51.449
 the water was running 

00:02:51.449 --> 00:02:54.449
 Kohlschreiber and the highly deserved 

00:02:56.349 --> 00:03:01.190
 Kohlschreiber the Clavister still though soon she was so right from the start 

00:03:01.189 --> 00:03:04.680
 were trying hard to keep level 4 

00:03:07.789 --> 00:03:09.329
 Kohlschreiber 

00:03:09.329 --> 00:03:11.040
 because they take life 

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:12.849
 rallies 

00:03:12.849 --> 00:03:14.559
 set at the end of May 

00:03:14.559 --> 00:03:17.559
 the little the decisive tick better 

00:03:19.459 --> 00:03:23.409
 He has confidently entered the tournament at the beginning of the tournament 

00:03:23.409 --> 00:03:26.239
 Tournament week he said "I'm kicking years for this 

00:03:26.239 --> 00:03:29.239
 To reach the final and now he was out 

00:03:37.939 --> 00:03:42.510
 high time with the once 2 3 behind were ever the second set 

00:03:42.509 --> 00:03:45.499
 the 5 different from the first one 

00:03:45.499 --> 00:03:50.650
 many breaks on both sides only one remained similar in the end had Maik's 

00:03:50.649 --> 00:03:53.040
 Philipp Kohlschreiber in the lead 

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:56.040
 So up comes the end 

00:04:04.909 --> 00:04:06.979
 again and again over the backhand 

00:04:06.979 --> 00:04:08.429
 along the line 

00:04:08.429 --> 00:04:11.589
 Botox is knowingly broad 

00:04:14.089 --> 00:04:17.089
 He had already guessed three match points at 0 40 

00:04:18.129 --> 00:04:19.459
 then came the 

00:04:19.459 --> 00:04:23.310
 Man from Cyprus again but now a fourth match point for Philipp 

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:26.310
 Kohlschreiber 

00:04:29.749 --> 00:04:35.330
 This last fantastic rally and is especially from Hungary Israel 

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:38.960
 which is clear for the Kohlschreiber first time in his career 

00:04:39.969 --> 00:04:41.669
 in the final here with the Queen 

00:04:41.669 --> 00:04:43.979
 we hope for more 

00:04:43.979 --> 00:04:46.979
 Sarkozy is his favorite 

00:04:47.539 --> 00:04:50.539
 they had no chance that he had to see 

00:04:51.059 --> 00:04:54.059
 harder to fall 

00:05:02.839 --> 00:05:06.059
 The situation in Iceland after 2002 was again sharp 

00:05:08.389 --> 00:05:11.389
 in the year 

00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:17.110
 in the game 

00:05:17.110 --> 00:05:18.139
 they are since 4 

00:05:18.139 --> 00:05:19.460
 not yet determined 

00:05:19.460 --> 00:05:20.710
 as Berbig 

00:05:20.710 --> 00:05:23.110
 or his twin partner 

00:05:23.110 --> 00:05:24.580
 Michael Juschni 

00:05:24.580 --> 00:05:27.559
 none of the two US to be are colorful 

00:05:27.559 --> 00:05:29.199
 Philipp Kohlschreiber 

00:05:29.199 --> 00:05:31.289
 he also had no favorite 

00:05:31.289 --> 00:05:32.870
 because whom he prefers 

00:05:32.870 --> 00:05:35.870
 want to play with the finals 

00:05:37.270 --> 00:05:39.990
 i would rather wish Juschni a bit i also have a positive one 

00:05:39.990 --> 00:05:42.279
 Balance sheet says it is not clean 

00:05:42.279 --> 00:05:46.139
 in particular evil kon-tiki he all saw it the judge Richard Nitzsche and 

00:05:46.139 --> 00:05:48.199
 Reich always trains unfortunately 

00:05:48.199 --> 00:05:51.559
 For each a feeling then in the game but they have to first 

00:05:52.180 --> 00:05:54.360
 hit the balls around the ears 

00:05:54.360 --> 00:05:58.490
 and the two skin are actually the balls around the ears 

00:05:58.490 --> 00:06:01.490
 House in the first place somewhat surprising Mikhail Juschni 

00:06:03.270 --> 00:06:07.030
 the new construction of the fire this time there he had to keep tight 

00:06:12.860 --> 00:06:14.659
 a little bit 

00:06:14.659 --> 00:06:18.539
 the story of the game the tight the tight wave Dietingen almost Allez 

00:06:18.539 --> 00:06:21.419
 in favor of Mikhail Yushni 

00:06:21.419 --> 00:06:23.689
 the first sentence 

00:06:23.689 --> 00:06:26.970
 already with four to six or six to four 

00:06:26.970 --> 00:06:29.970
 had decided for themselves 

00:06:30.930 --> 00:06:33.930
 30 kilos 

00:06:35.499 --> 00:06:38.499
 for the man from Russia 

00:06:43.059 --> 00:06:47.229
 Puma a point win for Tomas but I already at this stage was clear 

00:06:48.360 --> 00:06:51.570
 Since we are a little teen wonder must happen 

00:06:51.570 --> 00:06:55.070
 To turn this match again, it's also easy to rain 

00:06:55.070 --> 00:06:58.479
 started the only rain 

00:06:58.479 --> 00:07:01.469
 and this very much 

00:07:01.469 --> 00:07:03.719
 6 very very sunny 

00:07:03.719 --> 00:07:06.869
 in every way sunny tournament days 

00:07:06.869 --> 00:07:09.869
 Both are missing at the BMW Open 

00:07:10.369 --> 00:07:11.949
 That will be a short choice 

00:07:11.949 --> 00:07:12.870
 in favor of 

00:07:12.870 --> 00:07:15.870
 of guys are also still on the line 

00:07:17.999 --> 00:07:20.999
 what Berbig is true is not somehow his day 

00:07:21.740 --> 00:07:24.740
 could still do about this point 

00:07:30.559 --> 00:07:33.559
 I can not run a child already 

00:07:34.899 --> 00:07:37.399
 for Yushni, the final would be 

00:07:37.399 --> 00:07:39.270
 opponent 

00:07:39.270 --> 00:07:42.680
 by Philipp Kohlschreiber become for the bio-snow and Kohlschreiber the 

00:07:42.680 --> 00:07:46.149
 both of them together in the doubles 

00:07:46.149 --> 00:07:47.530
 also a very very 

00:07:47.530 --> 00:07:50.530
 interesting constellation 

00:07:52.789 --> 00:07:55.749
 and firmly leave this shape state 

00:07:55.749 --> 00:08:00.400
 Minute Milos Slaby Laser 6 2 4 6 2 3 wins eleven lines service 

00:08:00.400 --> 00:08:02.369
 hostages 

00:08:02.369 --> 00:08:03.409
 deliver the battles
