00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.460
 about number three for advanced 

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:07.410
 on the gym ball are atomic push 

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:10.559
 ups will now sometimes just once before 

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:12.150
 make and then tell something about this because 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:12.660
 Here are some things to consider 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:15.269
 should 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:17.310
 the topix goes as follows number two 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:19.949
 had the static co musculature and 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:21.840
 a dynamic share for the back 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:23.490
 now at third exercise at the atomic 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:25.320
 we have a dynamic message 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:27.480
 structures thanks to recommendations in the abdomen 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:29.640
 and again a press release a coup 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:31.849
 has everything connected with that now 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:31.849
 Pezziball 

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:43.730
 The first issue is how come in 

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:46.120
 my starting position i will now 

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:47.350
 first take and show 23 years 

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:50.090
 starting position 

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:51.290
 the forest is on the swing and 

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:53.150
 the lower leg and goes in 

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:55.640
 push-up position 

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:57.800
 so now a push up is done nicely deep 

00:00:55.640 --> 00:01:00.260
 not by sinking but it is hull 

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:02.050
 deep, and export the ball through to 

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:07.270
 Hook of the knee pulled to the chest 

00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:07.270
 make the license long 

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:17.840
 I 

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:19.010
 what we should not do I think 

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:22.700
 there are always people coming 

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:24.140
 available to you like you the next day 

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:26.150
 also do what we do not do right now 

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:28.910
 Of course it should be difficult, of course 

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:33.020
 the movement for the building is us 

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:34.550
 soon start the legs off for 

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:37.130
 a lower leg so in the air 

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:38.170
 directly becomes project for one 

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:42.190
 lower leg 

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:44.630
 So I am always very next day 

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:46.160
 I do not see anything so often 

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:49.640
 that someone turns off the boys abruptly 

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:51.710
 next day, it's amazing how easy 

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:54.200
 that's you need from their 

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:56.750
 deep muscles claimed per way 

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:58.900
 tip the ball as close as 

00:01:56.750 --> 00:01:58.900
 possible 

00:02:04.659 --> 00:02:11.399
 last something to get on the 

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:11.399
 The easiest way to know it is best 

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:22.140
 either way or if you already have one 

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:26.099
 a bit of culture nature has it once 

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:26.099
 go a piece of ammunition 

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:33.780
 3 tomic messages 

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:38.920
 I still have a little goodie 

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:41.720
 nice to control for 

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:45.220
 hull muscles and everything 

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:48.680
 the hip surrounds a great exercise for 

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:50.870
 the pool reading and so on that 

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:53.180
 had the alternate leg supporting position 

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:55.370
 Static work for all that 

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:58.280
 There is a need to work dynamically 

00:02:55.370 --> 00:03:00.829
 the people are going to shoot the same 

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:02.989
 starting position like tommy fischer so 

00:03:00.829 --> 00:03:05.590
 a support width where the lower leg up 

00:03:02.989 --> 00:03:05.590
 the pcb are 

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:12.410
 so now comes dynamic work for the 

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:14.210
 whole hip around the muscles in those 

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:16.220
 its important that the outside is plugged 

00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:18.500
 and knee joint, one leg works on the 

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:20.870
 bottom tip many stretch out of the 

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:23.590
 Butt beauty can describes again 

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:23.590
 on the ball on it 

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:43.410
 Of course, do not move it 

00:03:39.770 --> 00:03:47.099
 so that was the fourth exercise for 

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:49.500
 advanced back muscles are available 

00:03:47.099 --> 00:03:51.980
 I thank you for the partie 

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:51.980
 to see
