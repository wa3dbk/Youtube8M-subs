don't know if you realize but this is
not<00:03:45.230> something<00:03:45.530> that<00:03:45.800> I<00:03:45.860> put<00:03:46.100> together<00:03:47.230> this

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:48.230 
not something that I put together this

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:50.410 
not something that I put together this
is<00:03:48.410> not<00:03:48.560> a<00:03:48.590> performance<00:03:49.459> of<00:03:49.850> the<00:03:49.910> students

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:50.420 
is not a performance of the students

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:53.199 
is not a performance of the students
that<00:03:51.080> I<00:03:51.470> said<00:03:52.099> okay<00:03:52.519> you<00:03:52.670> punch<00:03:53.000> with<00:03:53.150> the

that I said okay you punch with the
right<00:03:53.239> budget<00:03:53.690> letting<00:03:54.110> you<00:03:54.170> do<00:03:54.319> this<00:03:54.350> you<00:03:54.590> can

00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:54.680 
right budget letting you do this you can

00:03:58.080 --> 00:03:58.090 
do that it's completely uncontrolled

00:03:58.090 --> 00:04:00.030 
do that it's completely uncontrolled
well<00:03:59.090> that's<00:03:59.269> it

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:00.040 
well that's it

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:02.430 
well that's it
you<00:04:01.040> know<00:04:01.160> you<00:04:01.220> can<00:04:01.459> pretty<00:04:01.700> much<00:04:01.790> tell

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:02.440 
you know you can pretty much tell

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:06.490 
you know you can pretty much tell
whether<00:04:03.440> your<00:04:03.680> techniques<00:04:04.100> work<00:04:04.870> cuz<00:04:05.870> if<00:04:06.440> you

00:04:06.490 --> 00:04:06.500 
whether your techniques work cuz if you

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:08.800 
whether your techniques work cuz if you
if<00:04:06.980> you<00:04:07.130> can<00:04:07.220> kind<00:04:07.370> of<00:04:07.489> messed<00:04:07.670> up<00:04:07.850> you<00:04:08.720> get

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:08.810 
if you can kind of messed up you get

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:11.320 
if you can kind of messed up you get
bopped<00:04:09.049> in<00:04:09.319> and<00:04:10.160> I've<00:04:10.280> gotten<00:04:10.610> punched<00:04:10.940> many

00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:11.330 
bopped in and I've gotten punched many

00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:14.070 
bopped in and I've gotten punched many
times<00:04:11.620> so<00:04:12.620> you<00:04:13.250> know<00:04:13.340> I'm<00:04:13.430> not<00:04:13.489> Superman

00:04:14.070 --> 00:04:14.080 
times so you know I'm not Superman

00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:16.330 
times so you know I'm not Superman
everybody<00:04:15.080> gets<00:04:15.260> it<00:04:15.440> even<00:04:15.470> the<00:04:15.739> best<00:04:15.920> martial

00:04:16.330 --> 00:04:16.340 
everybody gets it even the best martial

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:19.479 
everybody gets it even the best martial
arts<00:04:16.519> get<00:04:16.700> popped<00:04:17.090> it<00:04:17.840> make<00:04:18.109> mistakes<00:04:18.530> but

00:04:19.479 --> 00:04:19.489 
arts get popped it make mistakes but

00:04:19.489 --> 00:04:23.050 
arts get popped it make mistakes but
basically<00:04:20.450> I<00:04:20.630> would<00:04:20.989> say<00:04:21.340> the<00:04:22.340> most<00:04:22.520> important

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:23.060 
basically I would say the most important

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:28.150 
basically I would say the most important
principle<00:04:23.630> of<00:04:25.360> the<00:04:26.360> egg<00:04:26.510> is<00:04:26.660> just<00:04:27.130> that<00:04:28.130> I

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:28.160 
principle of the egg is just that I

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:33.580 
principle of the egg is just that I
teach<00:04:28.460> is<00:04:30.340> don't<00:04:31.340> be<00:04:31.640> there<00:04:31.960> so<00:04:32.960> you<00:04:33.020> move<00:04:33.289> out

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:33.590 
teach is don't be there so you move out

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:36.520 
teach is don't be there so you move out
of<00:04:33.620> the<00:04:33.890> way<00:04:33.919> of<00:04:34.490> techniques<00:04:35.200> that's<00:04:36.200> a<00:04:36.289> first

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:36.530 
of the way of techniques that's a first

00:04:36.530 --> 00:04:40.029 
of the way of techniques that's a first
thing<00:04:37.030> second<00:04:38.030> principle<00:04:38.539> is<00:04:38.800> when<00:04:39.800> someone

00:04:40.029 --> 00:04:40.039 
thing second principle is when someone

00:04:40.039 --> 00:04:42.880 
thing second principle is when someone
attacks<00:04:40.340> you<00:04:41.169> make<00:04:42.169> sure<00:04:42.320> they<00:04:42.440> really<00:04:42.560> try<00:04:42.860> to

00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:42.890 
attacks you make sure they really try to

00:04:42.890 --> 00:04:45.820 
attacks you make sure they really try to
hit<00:04:43.130> you<00:04:43.280> because<00:04:43.520> if<00:04:43.970> you<00:04:44.600> if<00:04:45.020> you<00:04:45.289> play

00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:45.830 
hit you because if you if you play

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:48.070 
hit you because if you if you play
around<00:04:46.100> with<00:04:46.280> it<00:04:46.430> in<00:04:46.520> the<00:04:46.580> dojo<00:04:46.789> whether<00:04:47.210> the

00:04:48.070 --> 00:04:48.080 
around with it in the dojo whether the

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:49.719 
around with it in the dojo whether the
school<00:04:48.350> or<00:04:48.590> they're<00:04:48.770> really<00:04:48.979> not<00:04:49.220> trying<00:04:49.550> to

00:04:49.719 --> 00:04:49.729 
school or they're really not trying to

00:04:49.729 --> 00:04:52.900 
school or they're really not trying to
hit<00:04:49.910> you<00:04:50.860> then<00:04:51.860> you<00:04:51.950> go<00:04:52.100> out<00:04:52.250> and<00:04:52.520> don't<00:04:52.700> really

00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:52.910 
hit you then you go out and don't really

00:04:52.910 --> 00:04:53.770 
hit you then you go out and don't really
attacked<00:04:53.300> you

00:04:53.770 --> 00:04:53.780 
attacked you

00:04:53.780 --> 00:04:57.460 
attacked you
that's<00:04:54.320> unrealistic<00:04:54.800> okay<00:04:55.760> so<00:04:56.630> I'm<00:04:57.229> something

00:04:57.460 --> 00:04:57.470 
that's unrealistic okay so I'm something

00:04:57.470 --> 00:05:00.760 
that's unrealistic okay so I'm something
I've<00:04:57.800> been<00:04:57.830> doing<00:04:58.190> my<00:04:58.400> demos<00:04:58.880> that<00:04:59.750> I<00:05:00.020> do<00:05:00.080> demos

00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:00.770 
I've been doing my demos that I do demos

00:05:00.770 --> 00:05:02.950 
I've been doing my demos that I do demos
all<00:05:01.039> the<00:05:01.220> time<00:05:01.460> or<00:05:01.640> anything<00:05:01.789> but<00:05:02.210> when<00:05:02.810> I<00:05:02.840> do

00:05:02.950 --> 00:05:02.960 
all the time or anything but when I do

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:06.159 
all the time or anything but when I do
have<00:05:03.140> the<00:05:03.289> chance<00:05:03.500> to<00:05:04.100> do<00:05:04.220> demo<00:05:04.490> I<00:05:04.820> just<00:05:05.750> saved

00:05:06.159 --> 00:05:06.169 
have the chance to do demo I just saved

00:05:06.169 --> 00:05:09.689 
have the chance to do demo I just saved
my<00:05:06.320> student<00:05:06.650> attack

00:05:09.689 --> 00:05:09.699 

00:05:09.699 --> 00:05:11.939 

and<00:05:10.569> that's<00:05:10.809> how<00:05:10.929> you<00:05:10.989> know<00:05:11.169> extra<00:05:11.499> jets<00:05:11.709> I

00:05:11.939 --> 00:05:11.949 
and that's how you know extra jets I

00:05:11.949 --> 00:05:13.709 
and that's how you know extra jets I
think<00:05:12.609> that<00:05:12.729> makes<00:05:12.939> a<00:05:13.029> good<00:05:13.209> idea<00:05:13.449> to<00:05:13.539> jet

00:05:13.709 --> 00:05:13.719 
think that makes a good idea to jet

00:05:13.719 --> 00:05:16.679 
think that makes a good idea to jet
system<00:05:14.079> if<00:05:14.409> it<00:05:14.949> works<00:05:15.359> anybody<00:05:16.359> who<00:05:16.539> questions

00:05:16.679 --> 00:05:16.689 
system if it works anybody who questions
