00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:56.170 
think this thing can't move if the

00:01:56.170 --> 00:02:00.810 
think this thing can't move if the
weights<00:01:56.380> at<00:01:56.560> five<00:01:59.280> I'm<00:02:00.280> gonna<00:02:00.399> keep<00:02:00.610> ice

flower<00:02:04.020> missing<00:02:05.020> starts<00:02:05.289> sinking<00:02:05.670> maybe<00:02:08.849> as

00:02:09.839 --> 00:02:09.849 
flower missing starts sinking maybe as

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:11.890 
if these little tiny coupe or goombahs

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:15.830 
if these little tiny coupe or goombahs
weight<00:02:12.130> anything

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:15.840 

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:19.410 

apparently<00:02:16.840> mario<00:02:17.140> weighs<00:02:17.319> nothing<00:02:17.590> I<00:02:18.420> find

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:19.420 
apparently mario weighs nothing I find

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:22.540 
apparently mario weighs nothing I find
that<00:02:19.599> hard<00:02:19.870> to<00:02:19.989> believe

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:22.550 

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:25.930 

I<00:02:23.560> think<00:02:24.560> it's<00:02:24.680> the<00:02:24.920> POW<00:02:25.130> block<00:02:25.160> you<00:02:25.700> got<00:02:25.820> to

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:25.940 
I think it's the POW block you got to

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:40.200 
I think it's the POW block you got to
keep<00:02:26.090> for<00:02:26.360> a<00:02:26.420> long<00:02:26.570> time<00:02:35.350> maybe<00:02:36.350> I<00:02:36.710> can't<00:02:37.190> oh

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:40.210 

00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:44.200
