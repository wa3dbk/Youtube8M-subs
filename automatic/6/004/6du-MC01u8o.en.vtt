00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:40.970 
oh this is the only one that's actually

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:42.460 
oh this is the only one that's actually
pretty<00:02:41.209> modern<00:02:41.750> but<00:02:41.930> it's<00:02:42.080> clear<00:02:42.440> that

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:42.470 
pretty modern but it's clear that

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:44.710 
pretty modern but it's clear that
instead<00:02:42.920> of<00:02:42.980> being<00:02:43.280> barren<00:02:43.819> Osborne<00:02:44.420> he's

00:02:44.710 --> 00:02:44.720 
instead of being barren Osborne he's

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:46.600 
instead of being barren Osborne he's
mayor<00:02:45.020> Osborne<00:02:45.680> and<00:02:45.800> he<00:02:45.950> runs<00:02:46.190> everything

mayor Osborne and he runs everything
right<00:02:47.209> right<00:02:47.570> and<00:02:47.870> what's<00:02:48.080> great<00:02:48.290> acclaim<00:02:48.920> is

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:49.100 
right right and what's great acclaim is

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:50.650 
right right and what's great acclaim is
trying<00:02:49.370> to<00:02:49.430> get<00:02:49.580> close<00:02:49.730> to<00:02:50.000> him<00:02:50.120> but<00:02:50.300> the<00:02:50.420> crazy

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:50.660 
trying to get close to him but the crazy

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:52.479 
trying to get close to him but the crazy
thing<00:02:50.870> is<00:02:51.050> she<00:02:51.320> can<00:02:51.350> actually<00:02:51.920> kind<00:02:52.310> of

00:02:52.479 --> 00:02:52.489 
thing is she can actually kind of

00:02:52.489 --> 00:02:55.960 
thing is she can actually kind of
remember<00:02:52.970> her<00:02:53.180> death<00:02:53.540> at<00:02:53.810> his<00:02:53.989> hands<00:02:54.970> range

00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:55.970 
remember her death at his hands range

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:58.809 
remember her death at his hands range
and<00:02:56.630> so<00:02:56.930> this<00:02:57.080> is<00:02:57.260> like<00:02:57.380> a<00:02:57.440> half<00:02:57.800> revenge<00:02:58.459> half

00:02:58.809 --> 00:02:58.819 
and so this is like a half revenge half

00:02:58.819 --> 00:03:00.670 
and so this is like a half revenge half
I<00:02:59.000> got<00:02:59.150> to<00:02:59.300> find<00:02:59.540> out<00:02:59.660> what's<00:02:59.959> happening<00:03:00.410> to
