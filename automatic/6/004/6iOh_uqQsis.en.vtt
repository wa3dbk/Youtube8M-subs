00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.810
 Hello everyone in this video I want you 

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:06.569
 tell about spinning from the company 

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:09.090
 The flagship of this spinning is called Kohl. 

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:12.599
 performance test spinning has 

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:14.460
 length 2 13 casting from 5 to 20 m in total 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:15.900
 what I want to say therefore spinning and 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:19.020
 spinning bought 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:23.279
 about 1 year ago 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:26.460
 In general, this spinning was catching 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:28.680
 pike in the amount of 5 and a half kilograms 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:31.320
 he was also wearing a skirt 9 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:34.230
 kilogram itself all catching 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:36.239
 happened in jack in general and spinning 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:39.899
 worked well established itself 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:42.090
 the best part works fine 

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:44.879
 All the bites well in the hand 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:46.649
 spinning is a little easier spinning 

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:49.890
 possesses fuji rings 

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:51.480
 has a glued-in reel holder 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:54.989
 at the back on looks like this 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:55.710
 way pretty comfortable and grip 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:58.170
 handy 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:01:00.840
 here is such a length in principle 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:04.229
 spinning good cool given back 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:06.270
 on can also answer 31 back to 

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:09.150
 possible limits I think since here 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:11.420
 captive tip somewhere somewhere well I 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:15.000
 you're still up to nine or ten 

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:17.130
 inside a bit of principle like twitch twitching 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:20.840
 it turns out pretty good 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:24.090
 bites off bite catching 

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:25.950
 trophy fish eat principle spinning 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:29.939
 works well not bad what I can say 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:32.820
 by buying this sweden as this 

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:35.009
 budget and budget series of spinning from 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:37.680
 company flagship you generally spinning yourself 

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:41.090
 On itself Well, since it is a budget then 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:43.500
 In principle, this spinning need to buy 

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:45.930
 directly at the points of sale that is 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:48.710
 in little that is in the shops on the Internet 

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:50.850
 this spinning is absolutely not for you 

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:52.110
 I recommend ordering for the simple 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:55.500
 the reason 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:57.090
 there are a lot of errors here 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:02:01.290
 that is, when I came to buy this 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:04.020
 shop to shop spinning I carried 

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:07.080
 The first model on the first model was such 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:08.880
 defect kent you tip this one 

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:11.280
 he watched the tip and so that's how it 

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:13.350
 way up there is something here 

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:15.300
 when it was all done well what about 

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:19.170
 so arched and that is why 

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:21.000
 peeling would then not endured 2 spinning on 

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:23.400
 the second spinning was such here 

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:26.190
 the situation here is this here is a tube for 

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:28.980
 connects with the main part of the back on 

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:31.230
 it was like this 

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:33.450
 circumcised that is or it is a factory marriage 

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:35.190
 was this summer in the store so did 

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:37.260
 because here it was possible to crack 

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:39.090
 I don't know well, that is, it was like this 

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:41.459
 Here until half this already says about 

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:45.000
 that k so my put on the main part 

00:02:41.459 --> 00:02:47.220
 then they began to melt do the fence but that 

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:49.190
 this year till the top tip is completely 

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:53.100
 part of it would just fly 

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:55.770
 power throws that is, it is already a marriage 3 

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:58.260
 who was on this spinnings in the third 

00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:59.239
 I got carried out this here 

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:02.070
 rings 

00:02:59.239 --> 00:03:04.799
 that is, when we connect them to the main 

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:06.959
 in part they did not look at each other 

00:03:04.799 --> 00:03:09.150
 there they were different then they were in 

00:03:06.959 --> 00:03:11.160
 different sides that is it is already a view of 

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:14.459
 that on this spinning bad bad 

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:17.130
 passed great and accordingly what have 

00:03:14.459 --> 00:03:19.739
 on the lure's flight range was by 

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:21.630
 reduced due to the fact that we would have something 

00:03:19.739 --> 00:03:25.049
 there is a big not exactly exactly 

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:27.360
 would go around the rings principle what else 

00:03:25.049 --> 00:03:29.430
 I can say therefore I strongly 

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:30.989
 I recommend that this spinning on the Internet 

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:32.700
 do not order because when you 

00:03:30.989 --> 00:03:34.799
 get the parcel open and see 

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:36.390
 highlighting will be able to spin on the spot not 

00:03:34.799 --> 00:03:38.760
 broken but when you come home 

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:41.040
 begin to examine it carefully or 

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:43.650
 You will already be used on a fishing trip you 

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:45.840
 notice defects and defects I think I will 

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:49.170
 because i'm out of three spinning then 

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:51.329
 there are 4 4 turned out to be less that is 

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:53.640
 you will go home you will see that such here 

00:03:51.329 --> 00:03:55.200
 the situation you will become very incomprehensible 

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:57.300
 you will call and in 

00:03:55.200 --> 00:04:00.900
 strands back well well i mean it will be 

00:03:57.300 --> 00:04:03.890
 posts on the bad filing for your time 

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:06.239
 so i recommend strongly 

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:08.370
 buy spinning directly in 

00:04:06.239 --> 00:04:10.800
 point of sale, you will see go 

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:12.599
 feel look take note 

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:14.760
 is there not with nato is everything here 

00:04:12.599 --> 00:04:17.160
 keeps well that is completely 

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:19.350
 Do you see the whole bank? 

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:21.840
 defects cracks then generally stick 

00:04:19.350 --> 00:04:25.740
 cool stick works fine everything 

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:28.410
 poklevki give in hand that is catch 

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:30.540
 trophy fish on it for this wand was 

00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:32.729
 Spinning itself is cool but since 

00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:36.030
 he budget that is the manufacturer decides 

00:04:32.729 --> 00:04:40.310
 and here such nuances here with rings 

00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:43.050
 problems here it is you part connects with 

00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:45.360
 this part is basic with the main part 

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:47.669
 back we also had problems that is 

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:50.100
 so I recommend you budget 

00:04:47.669 --> 00:04:52.350
 sticks must buy points 

00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:54.960
 sales because already my 

00:04:52.350 --> 00:04:57.090
 friends you ordered budget sticks and 

00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:57.650
 small defects were obtained which 

00:04:57.090 --> 00:05:00.389
 then 

00:04:57.650 --> 00:05:01.440
 brought very great inconvenience on 

00:05:00.389 --> 00:05:03.630
 fishing 

00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:06.090
 Well, in principle, who was interested in it 

00:05:03.630 --> 00:05:09.200
 video like everyone thanks for 

00:05:06.090 --> 00:05:09.200
 attention to new meetings
