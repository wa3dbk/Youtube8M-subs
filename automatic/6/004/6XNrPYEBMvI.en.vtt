redownload them well sometimes what it

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:17.649 
redownload them well sometimes what it
does<00:01:15.390> is<00:01:15.570> it<00:01:15.750> puts<00:01:16.200> the<00:01:16.409> excess<00:01:16.830> logs<00:01:17.189> of<00:01:17.549> your

00:01:17.649 --> 00:01:17.659 
does is it puts the excess logs of your

00:01:17.659 --> 00:01:20.590 
does is it puts the excess logs of your
cache<00:01:18.659> data<00:01:18.960> into<00:01:19.350> those<00:01:19.500> two<00:01:19.770> files<00:01:20.070> and

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:20.600 
cache data into those two files and

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:22.940 
cache data into those two files and
Sutton<00:01:21.600> and<00:01:21.930> when<00:01:22.080> they<00:01:22.170> get<00:01:22.320> full<00:01:22.619> it

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
Sutton and when they get full it

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:25.460 
Sutton and when they get full it
basically<00:01:23.670> just<00:01:24.000> exchanges<00:01:24.659> them<00:01:24.840> out<00:01:25.020> so

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
basically just exchanges them out so

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:27.380 
basically just exchanges them out so
this<00:01:25.590> gives<00:01:25.860> you<00:01:26.009> a<00:01:26.040> fresh<00:01:26.400> rebuild<00:01:26.939> of<00:01:27.119> a<00:01:27.240> of

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
this gives you a fresh rebuild of a of

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:32.450 
this gives you a fresh rebuild of a of
your<00:01:27.799> fable<00:01:28.799> anniversary<00:01:29.100> cache<00:01:30.890> so<00:01:31.890> once

00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:56.550 
largely unchanged you know I'm planning

00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:58.220 
largely unchanged you know I'm planning
on<00:02:56.700> a<00:02:56.760> high-end<00:02:57.150> PC<00:02:57.540> and<00:02:57.690> I<00:02:57.750> still<00:02:58.050> got

00:02:58.220 --> 00:02:58.230 
on a high-end PC and I still got

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:00.440 
on a high-end PC and I still got
stuttering<00:02:58.620> but<00:02:59.340> make<00:02:59.490> sure<00:02:59.670> your<00:02:59.850> vsync<00:03:00.330> is

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:00.450 
stuttering but make sure your vsync is

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:07.520 
stuttering but make sure your vsync is
on<00:03:00.980> that<00:03:01.980> will<00:03:02.160> help<00:03:02.280> fix<00:03:02.580> it<00:03:06.170> so<00:03:07.170> I'm<00:03:07.380> gonna

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:07.530 
on that will help fix it so I'm gonna

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:13.950 
on that will help fix it so I'm gonna
load<00:03:07.740> up<00:03:07.770> Oakville

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:13.960 

00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:18.180 

I<00:03:15.960> like<00:03:16.960> the<00:03:17.110> new<00:03:17.230> loading<00:03:17.530> screens<00:03:17.980> there

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:18.190 
I like the new loading screens there

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:24.750 
I like the new loading screens there
they're<00:03:18.670> pretty<00:03:18.820> nifty<00:03:23.670> something<00:03:24.670> that

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:24.760 
they're pretty nifty something that

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:26.130 
they're pretty nifty something that
you're<00:03:24.880> going<00:03:25.000> to<00:03:25.030> notice<00:03:25.390> right<00:03:25.450> off<00:03:25.780> the<00:03:25.960> bat

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:26.140 
you're going to notice right off the bat

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:34.170 
you're going to notice right off the bat
is<00:03:27.000> the<00:03:28.000> choppiness

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:34.180 

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:37.459 

you<00:03:34.659> see<00:03:34.840> how<00:03:34.989> see<00:03:35.709> how<00:03:35.739> it<00:03:36.040> skips<00:03:36.549> like<00:03:36.819> that<00:03:37.090> I

00:03:37.459 --> 00:03:37.469 
you see how see how it skips like that I

00:03:37.469 --> 00:03:39.509 
you see how see how it skips like that I
don't<00:03:38.469> know<00:03:38.650> why<00:03:38.829> I<00:03:38.859> think<00:03:39.069> it's<00:03:39.370> just

00:03:39.509 --> 00:03:39.519 
don't know why I think it's just

00:03:39.519 --> 00:03:41.550 
don't know why I think it's just
Oakville

00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:41.560 
Oakville

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:45.509 
Oakville
it's<00:03:42.459> it's<00:03:43.500> it's<00:03:44.500> so<00:03:44.739> irritating

00:03:45.509 --> 00:03:45.519 
it's it's it's so irritating

00:03:45.519 --> 00:03:47.610 
it's it's it's so irritating
I<00:03:45.670> think<00:03:46.000> it's<00:03:46.120> just<00:03:46.390> Oakville<00:03:46.540> that<00:03:47.200> ends<00:03:47.530> up

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:47.620 
I think it's just Oakville that ends up

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:51.629 
I think it's just Oakville that ends up
actually<00:03:47.829> breaking<00:03:48.579> it<00:03:48.730> so<00:03:49.950> but<00:03:50.950> after<00:03:51.579> you

00:03:51.629 --> 00:03:51.639 
actually breaking it so but after you

00:03:51.639 --> 00:03:53.550 
actually breaking it so but after you
get<00:03:51.760> out<00:03:51.819> of<00:03:52.030> Oakville<00:03:52.299> the<00:03:53.049> other<00:03:53.230> places

00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:53.560 
get out of Oakville the other places

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:57.300 
get out of Oakville the other places
we're<00:03:53.889> stuttering<00:03:54.280> too<00:03:54.780> but<00:03:55.780> after<00:03:55.930> you<00:03:56.310> clear

00:03:57.300 --> 00:03:57.310 
we're stuttering too but after you clear

00:03:57.310 --> 00:04:00.809

here we go

00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:29.210 
here we go
I<00:04:12.790> mean<00:04:13.599> loaded<00:04:13.870> up<00:04:13.959> hero's<00:04:14.319> guild

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:29.220 

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:33.050 

you'll<00:04:30.220> be<00:04:30.340> sharing<00:04:30.760> this<00:04:30.880> room<00:04:31.120> with<00:04:31.180> whisper

it's time to wake up
I<00:04:38.070> think<00:04:39.070> some<00:04:39.490> of<00:04:39.520> the<00:04:39.670> reason<00:04:40.030> why<00:04:40.240> it's

00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:40.540 
I think some of the reason why it's

00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:42.650 
I think some of the reason why it's
actually<00:04:41.020> messing<00:04:41.470> up<00:04:41.620> and<00:04:41.890> bugging<00:04:42.400> and

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:42.660 
actually messing up and bugging and

00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:45.990 
actually messing up and bugging and
stuff<00:04:43.660> like<00:04:43.810> that<00:04:44.110> funk<00:04:44.500> do<00:04:44.770> is<00:04:45.280> mostly<00:04:45.850> just

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:46.000 
stuff like that funk do is mostly just

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:48.810 
stuff like that funk do is mostly just
because<00:04:46.210> of<00:04:46.600> the<00:04:46.660> fact<00:04:46.960> that<00:04:47.220> they<00:04:48.220> reported

00:04:48.810 --> 00:04:48.820 
because of the fact that they reported

00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:52.050 
because of the fact that they reported
this<00:04:48.970> game<00:04:49.240> to<00:04:49.510> the<00:04:49.600> Unreal<00:04:49.960> Engine<00:04:50.730> I'm<00:04:51.730> not

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:52.060 
this game to the Unreal Engine I'm not

00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:53.430 
this game to the Unreal Engine I'm not
sure<00:04:52.300> if<00:04:52.420> it<00:04:52.540> was<00:04:52.630> actually<00:04:52.840> using<00:04:53.260> Unreal

00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:53.440 
sure if it was actually using Unreal
