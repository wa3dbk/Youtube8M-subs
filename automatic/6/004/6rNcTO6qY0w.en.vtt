00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 
hard mode and dollars in relation should

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:32.780 
hard mode and dollars in relation should
have<00:01:30.869> brought<00:01:31.110> new<00:01:31.530> drops<00:01:31.860> the<00:01:32.130> table<00:01:32.520> I<00:01:32.579> mean

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:32.790 
have brought new drops the table I mean

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:34.340 
have brought new drops the table I mean

I don't know what kind of new drops they
could<00:01:34.500> do<00:01:34.680> but<00:01:35.280> it<00:01:35.460> could<00:01:35.579> be<00:01:35.670> just<00:01:35.759> a<00:01:35.880> tiny<00:01:36.180> bit

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:36.329 
could do but it could be just a tiny bit

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:37.880 
could do but it could be just a tiny bit
better<00:01:36.479> than<00:01:36.869> the<00:01:37.049> regular<00:01:37.259> Bandos<00:01:37.799> glove

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
better than the regular Bandos glove

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:39.410 
better than the regular Bandos glove
with<00:01:38.220> the<00:01:38.250> regular<00:01:38.579> vandals<00:01:38.939> boot<00:01:39.119> so<00:01:39.329> the

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
with the regular vandals boot so the

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:41.330 
with the regular vandals boot so the
regular<00:01:39.750> bandos<00:01:40.110> passes<00:01:40.530> and<00:01:40.710> chest<00:01:40.920> just

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 
regular bandos passes and chest just

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:43.910 
regular bandos passes and chest just
like<00:01:41.460> a<00:01:41.579> tiny<00:01:41.909> bit<00:01:42.180> better<00:01:42.630> wouldn't<00:01:43.560> put<00:01:43.740> the

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920 
like a tiny bit better wouldn't put the

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:46.219 
like a tiny bit better wouldn't put the
original<00:01:44.100> ones<00:01:44.579> to<00:01:44.729> shit<00:01:44.970> but<00:01:45.479> obviously<00:01:46.140> if

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:46.229 
original ones to shit but obviously if

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:48.080 
original ones to shit but obviously if
you<00:01:46.320> want<00:01:46.560> to<00:01:46.619> look<00:01:46.770> for<00:01:46.829> in<00:01:47.159> even<00:01:47.579> better<00:01:47.729> gear

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090 
you want to look for in even better gear

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:50.359

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:53.359 
than it would be that and for everyone I
think<00:01:50.570> I'm<00:01:51.570> sure<00:01:51.810> of<00:01:51.990> they<00:01:52.350> promised<00:01:52.829> us<00:01:53.009> that

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:53.369 
think I'm sure of they promised us that

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:54.499 
think I'm sure of they promised us that
they're<00:01:53.700> actually<00:01:53.790> going<00:01:54.000> to<00:01:54.090> bring<00:01:54.240> out<00:01:54.360> new

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:55.770 
drops and they didn't so it's kind of a

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:57.260 
drops and they didn't so it's kind of a
letdown<00:01:55.950> but<00:01:56.280> anyways<00:01:56.640> contending<00:01:57.030> moment

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:31.870 
sure if that just means the staff or the

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:34.080 
sure if that just means the staff or the
actual<00:02:32.290> armor<00:02:32.859> like<00:02:33.040> replacing<00:02:33.579> virtus<00:02:33.939> i

00:02:37.349 --> 00:02:37.359 
would assume more of being like a off

00:02:37.359 --> 00:02:39.509 
would assume more of being like a off
hand<00:02:37.689> weapon<00:02:38.140> and<00:02:38.409> main<00:02:38.799> wet<00:02:39.010> hand<00:02:39.220> weapon

00:02:39.509 --> 00:02:39.519 
hand weapon and main wet hand weapon

00:02:39.519 --> 00:02:41.369
