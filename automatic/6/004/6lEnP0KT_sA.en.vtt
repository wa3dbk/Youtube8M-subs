00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:20.350 
very similar feel not exactly like this

00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:23.340 
very similar feel not exactly like this

what<00:03:25.300> fact<00:03:25.600> the<00:03:26.170> only<00:03:26.410> little<00:03:26.920> niggle<00:03:27.280> that<00:03:27.430> we

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:27.640 
what fact the only little niggle that we

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:30.090 
what fact the only little niggle that we
could<00:03:27.910> see<00:03:28.120> was<00:03:28.450> the<00:03:28.600> area<00:03:29.170> for<00:03:29.530> the<00:03:29.620> right<00:03:29.830> and

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:30.100 
could see was the area for the right and

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:32.490 
could see was the area for the right and
the<00:03:30.160> left<00:03:30.280> clicking<00:03:30.610> keys<00:03:31.239> is<00:03:31.600> very<00:03:32.110> close<00:03:32.470> to

00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:32.500 
the left clicking keys is very close to

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:35.340 
the left clicking keys is very close to
the<00:03:32.770> edge<00:03:32.920> so<00:03:33.390> ideally<00:03:34.390> it<00:03:34.540> won't<00:03:34.780> work<00:03:34.959> here

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:35.350 
the edge so ideally it won't work here

00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:38.310 
the edge so ideally it won't work here
usually<00:03:36.280> it's<00:03:36.760> perfect<00:03:37.480> if<00:03:37.630> you<00:03:37.780> press<00:03:38.290> it

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:38.320 
usually it's perfect if you press it

also<00:04:34.710> books<00:04:34.919> but<00:04:35.820> the<00:04:35.970> most<00:04:36.120> interesting<00:04:36.419> bit

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:36.840 
also books but the most interesting bit

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:40.310 
also books but the most interesting bit
is<00:04:37.139> it's<00:04:37.740> a<00:04:38.009> gorilla<00:04:38.250> glass<00:04:38.669> display<00:04:39.180> with<00:04:39.570> h2h

00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:40.320 
is it's a gorilla glass display with h2h

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:42.469 
is it's a gorilla glass display with h2h
glass<00:04:40.680> so<00:04:41.070> there<00:04:41.280> is<00:04:41.340> absolutely<00:04:41.520> no<00:04:42.090> need<00:04:42.120> for

00:04:42.469 --> 00:04:42.479 
glass so there is absolutely no need for

00:04:42.479 --> 00:04:44.629 
glass so there is absolutely no need for
the<00:04:42.570> plastic<00:04:42.780> or<00:04:43.440> the<00:04:43.590> flimsy<00:04:44.009> looking<00:04:44.310> bezel

with<00:05:02.760> that<00:05:02.940> is<00:05:03.000> it<00:05:03.780> can<00:05:03.810> be<00:05:04.050> compensated<00:05:04.409> by

00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:04.770 
with that is it can be compensated by

00:05:04.770 --> 00:05:06.760 
with that is it can be compensated by
increasing<00:05:05.490> the<00:05:05.639> brightness<00:05:05.789> slightly

00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:10.320 
increasing the brightness does not mean

00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:12.080 
increasing the brightness does not mean
