00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:40.250 
up to the root of C but at this point

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:42.890 
up to the root of C but at this point
the<00:01:41.250> rhythm<00:01:41.520> section<00:01:41.550> hit<00:01:42.000> Send<00:01:42.240> so<00:01:42.660> now<00:01:42.840> we

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:42.900 
the rhythm section hit Send so now we

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:44.390 
the rhythm section hit Send so now we
think<00:01:43.229> of<00:01:43.290> this<00:01:43.410> in<00:01:43.560> terms<00:01:43.590> of<00:01:43.860> that<00:01:44.009> this<00:01:44.250> is

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:44.400 
think of this in terms of that this is

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:51.969 
think of this in terms of that this is
the<00:01:44.550> fifth<00:01:44.960> for<00:01:46.550> second<00:01:47.550> madly<00:01:48.390> up<00:01:48.479> to<00:01:49.460> 3m<00:01:50.810> so

00:01:51.969 --> 00:01:51.979 
the fifth for second madly up to 3m so

00:01:51.979 --> 00:02:03.020 
the fifth for second madly up to 3m so
really<00:01:52.979> three<00:01:53.550> parts<00:01:53.630> g<00:01:54.630> minor<00:01:57.350> C<00:02:01.700> and<00:02:02.700> then

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:03.030 
really three parts g minor C and then

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:06.580 
really three parts g minor C and then
really<00:02:03.479> from<00:02:03.660> here<00:02:03.899> what<00:02:04.050> they<00:02:04.200> can<00:02:04.350> have<00:02:04.530> em

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:06.590 
really from here what they can have em

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:09.050 
really from here what they can have em
so<00:02:07.590> this<00:02:07.740> link<00:02:07.950> really<00:02:08.160> spells<00:02:08.520> out<00:02:08.729> each

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:09.060 
so this link really spells out each

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:11.680 
so this link really spells out each
chord<00:02:09.540> change<00:02:09.780> step<00:02:10.170> by<00:02:10.380> step<00:02:10.649> and<00:02:10.860> this<00:02:11.489> is<00:02:11.640> a
