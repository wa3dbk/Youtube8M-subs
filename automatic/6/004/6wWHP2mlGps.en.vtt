00:00:05.340 --> 00:00:09.180
 so what is going on my dear friends 

00:00:07.260 --> 00:00:10.639
 izmir re-entry from ingame masters 

00:00:09.180 --> 00:00:12.630
 and welcome to the first vigorous 

00:00:10.639 --> 00:00:14.430
 tips and tricks video on our 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:16.439
 channel and this video is about 

00:00:14.430 --> 00:00:18.029
 The question how to bankrupt quickly 

00:00:16.439 --> 00:00:19.860
 I can do a few things 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:22.619
 selected and written down 

00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:24.480
 which tips can give and we catch 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:26.580
 First of all, with my most important opinion 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:27.960
 after that this is the game mode 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:30.869
 Of course, game mode should be many 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:33.629
 bring and there are two game modes 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:35.129
 how to play or 

00:00:33.629 --> 00:00:37.170
 which are very good for leveling that is for 

00:00:35.129 --> 00:00:39.329
 to seek and save 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:42.420
 to seek a combination between 

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:45.000
 destroy and completion confirmed and 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:47.550
 the good thing about the mode you get 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.050
 250 points per graduation when you get the 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:50.280
 conclusion confirms the name of the brand 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:51.989
 of the against a collection there is still 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:54.480
 once 250 points when you graduate 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:56.250
 that means when you use the brand 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:58.559
 are of fallen comrades picks 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:00.570
 It also has 250 points and if you have one 

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:03.360
 headshot makes or the complete plaster 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:05.750
 whole 500 points as you can see there 

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:07.920
 a lot of p in the mode 

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:08.520
 However, the mode is not for everyone 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:10.770
 suitable 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:12.420
 all those who are not so upset 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:13.850
 I have slow gameplay standing there 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:16.380
 yet another mode for you though 

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:18.030
 All those who like to destroy destroy sooner 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:19.399
 have played what is an unfortunately 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:21.599
 strong main part does not exist anymore 

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:23.250
 Be sure with this mode 

00:01:21.599 --> 00:01:25.200
 a lot of success and a lot of fun then 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:27.179
 have leveling and for all those who 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:28.740
 do not stand so on slow gameplay 

00:01:27.179 --> 00:01:30.810
 the search for and rescue indeed the case 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:32.130
 there will be another mode for 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:34.200
 you and that is the new mode 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:36.300
 is pumped up and taken basically 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:37.890
 the team deathmatch with the little one 

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:39.750
 innovation that when you graduate 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:40.679
 you have 30 seconds to get a new one 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:43.670
 to conclude 

00:01:40.679 --> 00:01:45.990
 you get tempelbergs as for example 

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:47.340
 dexterity or stocker and how 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:48.390
 say you have 30 seconds to the time 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:50.910
 to make another conclusion otherwise 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:53.160
 you explode yourself and the good thing about it 

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:54.509
 is the first graduation if you have the 

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:57.000
 you can get 100 for the first degree 

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:59.160
 points and all others are 1 200 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:01.319
 worth points that means whether you team 

00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:01.679
 play deathmatch with double ep 

00:02:01.319 --> 00:02:04.250
 would 

00:02:01.679 --> 00:02:06.630
 there you can also level very quickly and 

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:08.670
 In general, it is actually one too 

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:10.679
 two player mode because he runs one 

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:13.110
 just head through the area 

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:14.849
 around and just try so many opponents 

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:17.040
 as possible take a life like this 

00:02:14.849 --> 00:02:18.269
 that things play modes 

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:20.310
 Finally, there's a small one 

00:02:18.269 --> 00:02:22.290
 Let's also add a side note 

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:24.690
 can earn a bit of ep and that with 

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:26.190
 Operation and operations are nothing 

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:27.930
 other than challenges the two 

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:28.709
 from last fall knows only those are called 

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:30.450
 different this time 

00:02:28.709 --> 00:02:31.800
 and as you can see there are 

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:34.110
 different categories 

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:37.590
 in the operations there are for example extra 

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:39.690
 operation or game modes operation and 

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:41.580
 they are most of them at least 

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:43.349
 are actually pretty easy as you are 

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:45.269
 you can sprint five miles with you 

00:02:43.349 --> 00:02:46.799
 By the way, women's marathon is done 

00:02:45.269 --> 00:02:49.049
 just equip marathon and after 

00:02:46.799 --> 00:02:52.430
 a few rounds you have one 

00:02:49.049 --> 00:02:54.900
 Operation done there are new ones 

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:58.040
 Adjustment unlock objects as you like 

00:02:54.900 --> 00:03:00.510
 can see and there are still 

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:02.640
 pressure points that you unlock for 

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:03.959
 I can still use it for that 

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:05.400
 a separate video you do the 

00:03:03.959 --> 00:03:06.989
 can earn pressure points faster 

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:09.299
 but otherwise it was actually 

00:03:06.989 --> 00:03:10.829
 Also with the tips how to level fast 

00:03:09.299 --> 00:03:12.299
 I hope that she is failed 

00:03:10.829 --> 00:03:13.920
 to evaluate the forgetful video too 

00:03:12.299 --> 00:03:15.390
 comment and subscribe if it 

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:16.709
 you liked and writes best 

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:18.840
 same and in the comments 

00:03:16.709 --> 00:03:20.100
 if you have another good method 

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:22.049
 to level up there I leave myself 

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:23.670
 of course happy to teach and otherwise 

00:03:22.049 --> 00:03:26.510
 I thank you for watching and until 

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:26.510
 next time skin acts
