whereas the like Liliana and acidic
slime<00:01:45.329> double<00:01:45.810> up<00:01:45.930> against<00:01:46.290> them<00:01:46.439> and<00:01:46.619> I<00:01:46.680> think

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740 
slime double up against them and I think

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:49.789 
slime double up against them and I think
they're<00:01:47.009> good<00:01:48.079> acidic<00:01:49.079> slime<00:01:49.229> is<00:01:49.350> also<00:01:49.619> good

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:49.799 
they're good acidic slime is also good

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:51.530 
they're good acidic slime is also good
against<00:01:50.100> like<00:01:50.220> your<00:01:50.460> mid-range<00:01:50.640> decks<00:01:51.090> the

hexproof<00:01:56.610> well<00:01:57.299> if<00:01:57.899> you<00:01:58.020> don't<00:01:58.290> die<00:01:58.500> before

hexproof well if you don't die before

00:01:58.680 --> 00:01:59.899 
hexproof well if you don't die before
then<00:01:59.040> you<00:01:59.250> can<00:01:59.369> blow<00:01:59.490> up<00:01:59.610> one<00:01:59.759> of<00:01:59.850> their

then you can blow up one of their

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:01.429 
then you can blow up one of their
enchantments<00:02:00.329> and<00:02:00.570> even<00:02:00.810> block<00:02:01.020> like<00:02:01.200> a<00:02:01.229> guy
