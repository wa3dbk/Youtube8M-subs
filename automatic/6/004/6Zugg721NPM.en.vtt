the glue targets or whatever they are
when<00:05:33.110> you<00:05:33.170> chew<00:05:33.350> em<00:05:33.470> they<00:05:33.560> glow<00:05:33.800> like<00:05:34.040> a

different color they're black if you use
those<00:05:36.530> at<00:05:36.710> 200<00:05:37.070> yards<00:05:37.100> you<00:05:37.850> have<00:05:38.000> no<00:05:38.180> problem

00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:38.570 
those at 200 yards you have no problem

00:05:38.570 --> 00:05:40.750 
those at 200 yards you have no problem
you<00:05:38.600> can<00:05:38.660> see<00:05:38.990> it<00:05:39.080> easily<00:05:39.490> now<00:05:40.490> if<00:05:40.610> you're

00:05:40.750 --> 00:05:40.760 
you can see it easily now if you're

00:05:40.760 --> 00:05:44.620 
you can see it easily now if you're
using<00:05:40.790> this<00:05:41.980> scope<00:05:42.980> to<00:05:43.250> go<00:05:43.460> hunting<00:05:43.850> like<00:05:44.390> out

00:05:44.620 --> 00:05:44.630 
using this scope to go hunting like out

using this scope to go hunting like out
in<00:05:44.660> Montana<00:05:45.200> or<00:05:45.500> wherever<00:05:45.740> you<00:05:46.130> know<00:05:46.190> you<00:05:46.280> got

00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:46.370 
in Montana or wherever you know you got

00:05:46.370 --> 00:05:48.100 
in Montana or wherever you know you got
a<00:05:46.400> whole<00:05:46.550> lot<00:05:46.670> of<00:05:46.760> open<00:05:46.970> space<00:05:47.210> this

00:05:48.100 --> 00:05:48.110 
a whole lot of open space this

00:05:48.110 --> 00:05:49.450 
a whole lot of open space this
definitely<00:05:48.590> won't<00:05:48.740> be<00:05:48.920> it<00:05:49.040> but<00:05:49.220> if<00:05:49.310> you're

00:05:49.450 --> 00:05:49.460 
definitely won't be it but if you're

00:05:49.460 --> 00:05:52.120 
definitely won't be it but if you're
like<00:05:49.640> a<00:05:49.670> place<00:05:49.970> like<00:05:50.180> Ohio<00:05:50.540> like<00:05:50.780> I<00:05:50.930> am<00:05:51.130> it's

00:05:52.120 --> 00:05:52.130 
like a place like Ohio like I am it's

00:05:52.130 --> 00:05:53.410 
like a place like Ohio like I am it's
not<00:05:52.190> a<00:05:52.280> whole<00:05:52.430> bunch<00:05:52.460> of<00:05:52.640> flatland<00:05:53.030> it's<00:05:53.270> not<00:05:53.390> a

00:05:53.410 --> 00:05:53.420 
not a whole bunch of flatland it's not a

00:05:53.420 --> 00:05:55.030 
not a whole bunch of flatland it's not a
whole<00:05:53.570> bunch<00:05:53.600> of<00:05:53.840> hills<00:05:54.080> I<00:05:54.380> think<00:05:54.740> this<00:05:54.890> is

00:05:55.030 --> 00:05:55.040 
whole bunch of hills I think this is

00:05:55.040 --> 00:05:55.420 
whole bunch of hills I think this is
good

00:05:55.420 --> 00:05:55.430 
good

00:05:55.430 --> 00:05:57.850 
good
I<00:05:55.460> can<00:05:56.060> definitely<00:05:56.180> count<00:05:56.510> points<00:05:57.350> on<00:05:57.590> a<00:05:57.620> buck

00:05:57.850 --> 00:05:57.860 
I can definitely count points on a buck

00:05:57.860 --> 00:05:59.740 
I can definitely count points on a buck
from<00:05:58.100> 500<00:05:58.580> yards<00:05:58.640> away<00:05:58.820> easy<00:05:59.120> with<00:05:59.330> this<00:05:59.480> and

00:05:59.740 --> 00:05:59.750 
from 500 yards away easy with this and

00:05:59.750 --> 00:06:04.090 
from 500 yards away easy with this and
you<00:06:00.710> know<00:06:00.790> it<00:06:01.790> works<00:06:02.240> good<00:06:02.390> for<00:06:02.450> that<00:06:03.070> like<00:06:04.070> I

00:06:04.090 --> 00:06:04.100 
you know it works good for that like I

00:06:04.100 --> 00:06:05.230 
you know it works good for that like I
said<00:06:04.370> you<00:06:04.520> know<00:06:04.640> if<00:06:04.730> you're<00:06:04.910> if<00:06:05.060> you're<00:06:05.090> going

00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:06.820 
said you know if you're if you're going
if<00:06:05.630> you're<00:06:05.750> using<00:06:05.960> this<00:06:06.140> just<00:06:06.320> for<00:06:06.500> the<00:06:06.590> range

00:06:06.820 --> 00:06:06.830 
if you're using this just for the range

00:06:06.830 --> 00:06:09.670 
if you're using this just for the range
definitely<00:06:07.610> get<00:06:07.700> the<00:06:07.790> straig<00:06:08.470> don't<00:06:09.470> get<00:06:09.590> the

pushing the limits of this so hopefully

00:07:51.970 --> 00:07:53.220 
pushing the limits of this so hopefully
this<00:07:52.270> helped<00:07:52.480> you<00:07:52.540> out<00:07:52.570> if<00:07:52.750> you<00:07:52.840> know<00:07:52.930> any
