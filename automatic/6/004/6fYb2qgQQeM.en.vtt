bluray projects and I'm going to talk

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:19.970 
bluray projects and I'm going to talk
about<00:00:18.210> those<00:00:18.570> guys<00:00:18.840> in<00:00:19.170> this<00:00:19.320> tutorial

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:19.980 
about those guys in this tutorial

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:22.010 
about those guys in this tutorial
starting<00:00:20.789> off<00:00:20.910> there's<00:00:21.180> a<00:00:21.210> rule<00:00:21.390> of<00:00:21.510> thumb<00:00:21.570> for

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:22.020 
starting off there's a rule of thumb for

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:24.230 
starting off there's a rule of thumb for
DVDs<00:00:22.500> and<00:00:22.859> that<00:00:22.980> is<00:00:23.130> you<00:00:23.580> could<00:00:23.730> have<00:00:23.910> two

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:24.240 
DVDs and that is you could have two

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:26.720 
DVDs and that is you could have two
hours<00:00:24.390> of<00:00:24.720> reasonably<00:00:25.619> good<00:00:25.890> quality<00:00:26.430> video

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:26.730 
hours of reasonably good quality video

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:29.570 
hours of reasonably good quality video
on<00:00:27.060> a<00:00:27.119> single<00:00:27.689> sided<00:00:27.930> single<00:00:28.439> layer<00:00:28.650> DVD<00:00:29.340> and

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:29.580 
on a single sided single layer DVD and

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:31.279 
on a single sided single layer DVD and
that's<00:00:29.730> kind<00:00:30.119> of<00:00:30.210> the<00:00:30.269> cusp<00:00:30.689> that's<00:00:30.990> kind<00:00:31.230> of

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:31.289 
that's kind of the cusp that's kind of

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:32.900 
that's kind of the cusp that's kind of
where<00:00:31.470> things<00:00:31.650> start<00:00:32.009> dropping<00:00:32.430> off<00:00:32.579> in<00:00:32.730> terms

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:32.910 
where things start dropping off in terms

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:34.940 
where things start dropping off in terms
of<00:00:33.090> quality<00:00:33.570> at<00:00:34.140> two<00:00:34.410> hours<00:00:34.590> you're

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:34.950 
of quality at two hours you're

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:36.889 
of quality at two hours you're
compressing<00:00:35.550> your<00:00:35.670> video<00:00:36.000> and<00:00:36.210> audio<00:00:36.510> at

00:00:36.889 --> 00:00:36.899 
compressing your video and audio at

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:39.950 
compressing your video and audio at
about<00:00:37.110> five<00:00:37.410> megabits<00:00:38.250> per<00:00:38.399> second<00:00:39.239> the<00:00:39.719> top

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:39.960 
about five megabits per second the top

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:42.530 
about five megabits per second the top
end<00:00:40.320> of<00:00:40.649> a<00:00:40.739> compression<00:00:41.100> level<00:00:41.550> for<00:00:41.820> mpeg-2<00:00:42.360> is

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:42.540 
end of a compression level for mpeg-2 is

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:44.270 
end of a compression level for mpeg-2 is
a<00:00:42.570> little<00:00:42.930> bit<00:00:43.050> more<00:00:43.230> than<00:00:43.379> nine<00:00:43.620> megabits<00:00:44.219> per

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 
a little bit more than nine megabits per

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:45.619 
a little bit more than nine megabits per
second<00:00:44.670> so<00:00:44.730> this<00:00:44.820> is<00:00:44.969> a<00:00:45.000> little<00:00:45.180> bit<00:00:45.270> more<00:00:45.450> than

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:45.629 
second so this is a little bit more than

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:47.840 
second so this is a little bit more than
half<00:00:45.930> of<00:00:46.140> the<00:00:46.289> top<00:00:46.500> end<00:00:46.860> so<00:00:47.430> when<00:00:47.550> you<00:00:47.610> get<00:00:47.730> to

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850 
half of the top end so when you get to

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:49.459 
half of the top end so when you get to
about<00:00:48.000> two<00:00:48.180> hours<00:00:48.360> you're<00:00:48.690> reaching<00:00:48.899> kind<00:00:49.350> of

00:00:49.459 --> 00:00:49.469 
about two hours you're reaching kind of

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:50.869 
about two hours you're reaching kind of
the<00:00:49.530> point<00:00:49.800> where<00:00:49.950> the<00:00:50.100> quality<00:00:50.550> will<00:00:50.670> start

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:50.879 
the point where the quality will start

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:52.819 
the point where the quality will start
falling<00:00:51.239> off<00:00:51.600> so<00:00:52.289> if<00:00:52.379> you're<00:00:52.440> thinking<00:00:52.800> about

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:52.829 
falling off so if you're thinking about

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:54.500 
falling off so if you're thinking about
having<00:00:53.190> something<00:00:53.370> longer<00:00:53.850> than<00:00:54.030> two<00:00:54.329> hours

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
having something longer than two hours

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:56.569 
having something longer than two hours
let's<00:00:55.230> say<00:00:55.350> considerably<00:00:55.890> longer<00:00:56.190> like<00:00:56.460> you

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579 
let's say considerably longer like you

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:57.979 
let's say considerably longer like you
know<00:00:56.640> two<00:00:56.879> and<00:00:56.910> a<00:00:57.059> half<00:00:57.210> three<00:00:57.570> or<00:00:57.750> whatever

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989 
know two and a half three or whatever

00:00:57.989 --> 00:00:59.119 
know two and a half three or whatever
you<00:00:58.109> really<00:00:58.140> should<00:00:58.410> think<00:00:58.590> about<00:00:58.649> going<00:00:58.980> to<00:00:59.100> a

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
you really should think about going to a

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:02.930 
you really should think about going to a
dual<00:00:59.489> layer<00:01:00.120> DVD<00:01:00.840> or<00:01:01.079> a<00:01:01.109> two-sided<00:01:01.649> DVD<00:01:02.280> okay

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.940 
dual layer DVD or a two-sided DVD okay

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:04.880 
dual layer DVD or a two-sided DVD okay
let's<00:01:03.120> talk<00:01:03.210> about<00:01:03.270> blu-ray<00:01:03.899> blu-ray<00:01:04.439> the

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
let's talk about blu-ray blu-ray the

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:07.070 
let's talk about blu-ray blu-ray the
rule<00:01:05.040> of<00:01:05.159> thumb<00:01:05.339> is<00:01:05.549> similar<00:01:06.150> but<00:01:06.750> this<00:01:06.930> is

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
rule of thumb is similar but this is

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:08.630 
rule of thumb is similar but this is
kind<00:01:07.320> of<00:01:07.409> the<00:01:07.560> low<00:01:07.770> end<00:01:08.130> for<00:01:08.369> the<00:01:08.460> rule<00:01:08.610> of

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
kind of the low end for the rule of

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:12.080 
kind of the low end for the rule of
thumb<00:01:08.970> you<00:01:09.090> can<00:01:09.330> aim<00:01:09.570> for<00:01:09.600> about<00:01:10.340> 2.2<00:01:11.340> hours<00:01:11.850> of

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.090 
thumb you can aim for about 2.2 hours of

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:14.390 
thumb you can aim for about 2.2 hours of
video<00:01:12.360> when<00:01:12.869> you're<00:01:12.990> compressing<00:01:13.680> at<00:01:13.799> 25

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:14.400 
video when you're compressing at 25

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:16.640 
video when you're compressing at 25
megabits<00:01:14.909> per<00:01:15.060> second<00:01:15.540> but<00:01:15.659> 25<00:01:16.080> megabits<00:01:16.530> per

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:16.650 
megabits per second but 25 megabits per

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:18.800 
megabits per second but 25 megabits per
second<00:01:17.070> unlike<00:01:17.400> the<00:01:17.640> DVD<00:01:18.090> setting<00:01:18.479> is<00:01:18.630> not

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
second unlike the DVD setting is not

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:20.749 
second unlike the DVD setting is not
really<00:01:19.229> the<00:01:19.380> low<00:01:19.560> end<00:01:19.860> of<00:01:20.100> the<00:01:20.220> compression

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759 
really the low end of the compression

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:22.520 
really the low end of the compression
for<00:01:20.970> blu-ray<00:01:21.270> the<00:01:21.659> low<00:01:21.840> end<00:01:22.020> of<00:01:22.080> compression

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
for blu-ray the low end of compression

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:24.800 
for blu-ray the low end of compression
for<00:01:22.560> blu-ray<00:01:22.950> is<00:01:23.070> 15<00:01:23.640> megabits<00:01:24.150> per<00:01:24.270> second<00:01:24.720> so

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
for blu-ray is 15 megabits per second so

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:27.200 
for blu-ray is 15 megabits per second so
25<00:01:25.200> is<00:01:25.290> kind<00:01:25.470> of<00:01:25.530> the<00:01:25.650> mid-range<00:01:26.250> and<00:01:26.549> so<00:01:27.119> you

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210 
25 is kind of the mid-range and so you

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:29.899 
25 is kind of the mid-range and so you
get<00:01:27.420> in<00:01:27.540> two<00:01:27.810> hours<00:01:28.229> of<00:01:28.409> really<00:01:28.680> good<00:01:29.130> quality

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:29.909 
get in two hours of really good quality

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:32.179 
get in two hours of really good quality
video<00:01:30.180> at<00:01:30.329> 25<00:01:30.720> megabits<00:01:31.110> per<00:01:31.259> second<00:01:31.710> you<00:01:32.159> can

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:32.189 
video at 25 megabits per second you can

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:34.249 
video at 25 megabits per second you can
get<00:01:32.490> maybe<00:01:32.759> three<00:01:33.210> and<00:01:33.329> a<00:01:33.420> half<00:01:33.659> hours<00:01:34.170> of

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259 
get maybe three and a half hours of

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:36.950 
get maybe three and a half hours of
pretty<00:01:35.070> good<00:01:35.369> quality<00:01:35.640> video<00:01:36.180> running<00:01:36.450> at<00:01:36.600> 15

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
pretty good quality video running at 15

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:38.870 
pretty good quality video running at 15
megabits<00:01:37.380> per<00:01:37.470> second<00:01:37.979> on<00:01:38.100> a<00:01:38.159> blu-ray<00:01:38.490> as<00:01:38.700> well

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
megabits per second on a blu-ray as well

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:41.390 
megabits per second on a blu-ray as well
so<00:01:39.150> think<00:01:39.689> in<00:01:39.780> terms<00:01:39.960> of<00:01:40.229> your<00:01:40.530> length<00:01:40.860> of<00:01:41.100> time

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:41.400 
so think in terms of your length of time

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:43.850 
so think in terms of your length of time
for<00:01:41.759> one<00:01:42.240> single<00:01:42.840> sided<00:01:43.049> single<00:01:43.680> layer

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860 
for one single sided single layer

for one single sided single layer
blu-ray<00:01:44.340> disc<00:01:44.610> as<00:01:44.790> something<00:01:45.299> between<00:01:45.450> two

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:45.869 
blu-ray disc as something between two

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:47.840 
blu-ray disc as something between two
and<00:01:46.049> a<00:01:46.110> half<00:01:46.320> to<00:01:46.619> three<00:01:46.649> and<00:01:47.310> a<00:01:47.399> half<00:01:47.579> right

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850 
and a half to three and a half right

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:49.370 
and a half to three and a half right
around<00:01:48.000> there<00:01:48.210> in<00:01:48.329> terms<00:01:48.479> of<00:01:48.720> amount<00:01:49.200> of<00:01:49.320> time

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380 
around there in terms of amount of time

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:51.740 
around there in terms of amount of time
that<00:01:49.979> you<00:01:50.100> can<00:01:50.220> have<00:01:50.490> on<00:01:50.790> a<00:01:50.850> blu-ray<00:01:51.270> disc<00:01:51.630> and

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:51.750 
that you can have on a blu-ray disc and

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:54.319 
that you can have on a blu-ray disc and
still<00:01:51.990> have<00:01:52.110> pretty<00:01:52.530> good<00:01:53.009> quality<00:01:53.670> let<00:01:54.210> me

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:54.329 
still have pretty good quality let me

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:55.940 
still have pretty good quality let me
show<00:01:54.450> you<00:01:54.509> how<00:01:54.600> this<00:01:54.720> translates<00:01:55.259> out<00:01:55.409> inside

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:55.950 
show you how this translates out inside

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:58.190 
show you how this translates out inside
encore<00:01:56.670> here's<00:01:57.390> a<00:01:57.479> little<00:01:57.659> project<00:01:57.869> that<00:01:58.110> I

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:58.200 
encore here's a little project that I

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:00.260 
encore here's a little project that I
made<00:01:58.439> just<00:01:58.469> to<00:01:58.950> demonstrate<00:01:59.520> this<00:01:59.790> so<00:02:00.149> the

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:00.270 
made just to demonstrate this so the

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:02.600 
made just to demonstrate this so the
project<00:02:00.689> has<00:02:00.869> the<00:02:00.899> five<00:02:01.439> timelines<00:02:02.130> in<00:02:02.310> it

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:02.610 
project has the five timelines in it

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:04.010 
project has the five timelines in it
when<00:02:02.820> the<00:02:02.939> timelines<00:02:03.390> have<00:02:03.600> some<00:02:03.780> video

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:04.020 
when the timelines have some video

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:06.139 
when the timelines have some video
inside<00:02:04.320> them<00:02:04.619> has<00:02:05.040> a<00:02:05.100> slideshow<00:02:05.520> and<00:02:05.850> do<00:02:05.969> keep

00:02:06.139 --> 00:02:06.149 
inside them has a slideshow and do keep

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:07.730 
inside them has a slideshow and do keep
in<00:02:06.240> mind<00:02:06.390> that<00:02:06.509> slideshows<00:02:06.990> are<00:02:07.170> included<00:02:07.619> in

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:07.740 
in mind that slideshows are included in

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:09.889 
in mind that slideshows are included in
the<00:02:07.829> overall<00:02:07.860> size<00:02:08.670> of<00:02:09.000> the<00:02:09.119> DVD<00:02:09.509> they're

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:09.899 
the overall size of the DVD they're

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:12.380 
the overall size of the DVD they're
compressed<00:02:10.259> too<00:02:10.560> just<00:02:10.979> like<00:02:11.069> videos<00:02:11.489> are<00:02:11.700> then

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:12.390 
compressed too just like videos are then

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:13.670 
compressed too just like videos are then
here<00:02:12.599> are<00:02:12.690> the<00:02:12.720> actual<00:02:13.140> assets

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680 
here are the actual assets

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:15.020 
here are the actual assets
are<00:02:13.799> going<00:02:13.890> to<00:02:13.950> be<00:02:14.069> compressed<00:02:14.459> in<00:02:14.760> addition

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:15.030 
are going to be compressed in addition

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:17.179 
are going to be compressed in addition
to<00:02:15.150> the<00:02:15.269> slides<00:02:15.599> bunch<00:02:16.379> of<00:02:16.530> video<00:02:16.859> and<00:02:17.069> audio

00:02:17.179 --> 00:02:17.189 
to the slides bunch of video and audio

00:02:17.189 --> 00:02:19.220 
to the slides bunch of video and audio
files<00:02:17.700> so<00:02:18.299> this<00:02:18.480> is<00:02:18.599> great<00:02:18.840> little<00:02:19.049> feature

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:19.230 
files so this is great little feature

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:21.259 
files so this is great little feature
inside<00:02:19.709> encore<00:02:20.099> that<00:02:20.129> tells<00:02:20.519> you<00:02:20.760> how<00:02:21.000> much

00:02:21.259 --> 00:02:21.269 
inside encore that tells you how much

00:02:21.269 --> 00:02:23.209 
inside encore that tells you how much
space<00:02:21.540> your<00:02:21.959> project<00:02:22.409> is<00:02:22.530> going<00:02:22.709> to<00:02:22.769> take<00:02:22.829> up

00:02:23.209 --> 00:02:23.219 
space your project is going to take up

00:02:23.219 --> 00:02:25.520 
space your project is going to take up
based<00:02:23.819> on<00:02:24.120> the<00:02:24.299> transcode<00:02:24.870> settings<00:02:25.260> that<00:02:25.379> you

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:25.530 
based on the transcode settings that you

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:27.500 
based on the transcode settings that you
set<00:02:25.859> for<00:02:26.250> that<00:02:26.370> project<00:02:26.700> so<00:02:27.090> if<00:02:27.150> you<00:02:27.239> go<00:02:27.329> to<00:02:27.390> the

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:27.510 
set for that project so if you go to the

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:30.050 
set for that project so if you go to the
build<00:02:27.780> panel<00:02:28.349> and<00:02:28.980> let's<00:02:29.129> say<00:02:29.250> I<00:02:29.280> look<00:02:29.430> at<00:02:29.549> DVD

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:30.060 
build panel and let's say I look at DVD

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:31.520 
build panel and let's say I look at DVD
and<00:02:30.239> scroll<00:02:30.569> down<00:02:30.750> here<00:02:30.989> you're<00:02:31.109> gonna<00:02:31.230> see

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:31.530 
and scroll down here you're gonna see

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:33.619 
and scroll down here you're gonna see
how<00:02:31.709> much<00:02:31.889> space<00:02:32.250> the<00:02:32.760> stuff<00:02:33.030> that<00:02:33.239> you've<00:02:33.359> got

00:02:33.619 --> 00:02:33.629 
how much space the stuff that you've got

00:02:33.629 --> 00:02:36.500 
how much space the stuff that you've got
will<00:02:33.959> take<00:02:34.230> up<00:02:34.500> on<00:02:34.739> a<00:02:34.799> DVD<00:02:35.159> the<00:02:35.670> prediction

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:36.510 
will take up on a DVD the prediction

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:38.000 
will take up on a DVD the prediction
here<00:02:36.659> the<00:02:36.840> calculated<00:02:37.379> prediction<00:02:37.739> is<00:02:37.859> that

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:38.010 
here the calculated prediction is that

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:39.559 
here the calculated prediction is that
that<00:02:38.219> material<00:02:38.700> we<00:02:38.790> saw<00:02:38.939> earlier<00:02:39.269> will<00:02:39.420> take

00:02:39.559 --> 00:02:39.569 
that material we saw earlier will take

00:02:39.569 --> 00:02:41.990 
that material we saw earlier will take
up<00:02:39.719> about<00:02:40.010> 391<00:02:41.010> megabytes<00:02:41.549> meaning<00:02:41.879> you've

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:42.000 
up about 391 megabytes meaning you've

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.119 
up about 391 megabytes meaning you've
got<00:02:42.150> 4.3<00:02:42.959> left<00:02:43.319> you<00:02:43.590> know<00:02:43.709> you<00:02:43.799> start<00:02:44.010> with

00:02:44.119 --> 00:02:44.129 
got 4.3 left you know you start with

00:02:44.129 --> 00:02:46.909 
got 4.3 left you know you start with
about<00:02:44.219> 4.7<00:02:45.090> here's<00:02:45.900> what's<00:02:46.109> left<00:02:46.200> after<00:02:46.709> you

00:02:46.909 --> 00:02:46.919 
about 4.7 here's what's left after you

00:02:46.919 --> 00:02:48.679 
about 4.7 here's what's left after you
put<00:02:47.129> that<00:02:47.250> much<00:02:47.489> stuff<00:02:47.819> on<00:02:48.060> so<00:02:48.239> you<00:02:48.329> got<00:02:48.480> quite

00:02:48.679 --> 00:02:48.689 
put that much stuff on so you got quite

00:02:48.689 --> 00:02:50.750 
put that much stuff on so you got quite
a<00:02:48.720> bit<00:02:48.870> more<00:02:48.959> room<00:02:49.200> here<00:02:49.230> to<00:02:49.620> go<00:02:49.799> and<00:02:50.040> the

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:50.760 
a bit more room here to go and the

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:52.129 
a bit more room here to go and the
blu-ray<00:02:50.939> side<00:02:51.299> of<00:02:51.450> things<00:02:51.659> if<00:02:51.840> you<00:02:51.930> were<00:02:52.049> to

00:02:52.129 --> 00:02:52.139 
blu-ray side of things if you were to

00:02:52.139 --> 00:02:54.349 
blu-ray side of things if you were to
create<00:02:52.319> a<00:02:52.409> blu-ray<00:02:52.709> out<00:02:52.829> of<00:02:52.950> that<00:02:53.069> material<00:02:53.359> it

00:02:54.349 --> 00:02:54.359 
create a blu-ray out of that material it

00:02:54.359 --> 00:02:56.240 
create a blu-ray out of that material it
would<00:02:54.480> take<00:02:54.659> up<00:02:54.840> about<00:02:55.139> a<00:02:55.200> gigabyte<00:02:55.590> or<00:02:55.889> so

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:56.250 
would take up about a gigabyte or so

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:58.640 
would take up about a gigabyte or so
right<00:02:56.879> there<00:02:57.180> the<00:02:57.900> thing<00:02:58.079> is<00:02:58.200> this<00:02:58.349> is<00:02:58.530> the

00:02:58.640 --> 00:02:58.650 
right there the thing is this is the

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:00.589 
right there the thing is this is the
prediction<00:02:59.040> based<00:02:59.430> on<00:02:59.669> your<00:02:59.939> projects

00:03:00.589 --> 00:03:00.599 
prediction based on your projects

00:03:00.599 --> 00:03:02.720 
prediction based on your projects
transcode<00:03:01.230> settings<00:03:01.620> let<00:03:02.129> me<00:03:02.219> show<00:03:02.400> you<00:03:02.459> where

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:05.040 
you can see those settings it's going to

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:08.390 
you can see those settings it's going to
file<00:03:05.569> project<00:03:06.569> settings<00:03:06.959> like<00:03:07.200> that<00:03:07.439> that

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:08.400 
file project settings like that that

00:03:31.729 --> 00:03:31.739 
megabits per second I think it should be

00:03:31.739 --> 00:03:34.219 
megabits per second I think it should be
25<00:03:32.280> but<00:03:32.609> nevertheless<00:03:32.819> that<00:03:33.299> is<00:03:33.510> the<00:03:33.900> default

00:03:34.219 --> 00:03:34.229

00:03:35.939 --> 00:03:37.309 
setting 15 megabits per second and
that's<00:03:36.090> what<00:03:36.329> was<00:03:36.479> set<00:03:36.720> when<00:03:36.930> you<00:03:37.019> created

00:03:37.309 --> 00:03:37.319 
that's what was set when you created

00:03:37.319 --> 00:03:38.990 
that's what was set when you created
this<00:03:37.439> project<00:03:38.010> let's<00:03:38.489> take<00:03:38.669> a<00:03:38.699> look<00:03:38.849> at<00:03:38.909> the

00:03:38.990 --> 00:03:39.000 
this project let's take a look at the

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:42.080 
this project let's take a look at the
DVD<00:03:39.150> side<00:03:39.629> the<00:03:40.379> DVD<00:03:40.739> side<00:03:40.979> its<00:03:41.129> mpeg-2<00:03:41.729> it<00:03:41.879> has

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:42.090 
DVD side the DVD side its mpeg-2 it has

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:43.610 
DVD side the DVD side its mpeg-2 it has
to<00:03:42.239> be<00:03:42.329> mpeg-2<00:03:42.900> you<00:03:43.049> don't<00:03:43.199> have<00:03:43.290> a<00:03:43.349> choice

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:43.620 
to be mpeg-2 you don't have a choice

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:45.170 
to be mpeg-2 you don't have a choice
there<00:03:43.979> and<00:03:44.220> we're<00:03:44.609> going<00:03:44.729> to<00:03:44.759> do<00:03:44.879> Dolby

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:45.180 
there and we're going to do Dolby

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:46.909 
there and we're going to do Dolby
Digital<00:03:45.209> audio<00:03:45.840> here<00:03:45.989> as<00:03:46.049> well<00:03:46.199> and<00:03:46.709> here<00:03:46.829> it

00:03:46.909 --> 00:03:46.919 
Digital audio here as well and here it

00:03:46.919 --> 00:03:48.920 
Digital audio here as well and here it
says<00:03:47.069> the<00:03:47.220> maximum<00:03:47.459> audio<00:03:48.120> video<00:03:48.389> bitrate<00:03:48.629> is

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:48.930 
says the maximum audio video bitrate is

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:50.960 
says the maximum audio video bitrate is
6<00:03:49.319> megabits<00:03:49.979> per<00:03:50.099> second<00:03:50.549> now<00:03:50.639> I<00:03:50.669> told<00:03:50.849> you

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:50.970 
6 megabits per second now I told you

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:53.240 
6 megabits per second now I told you
earlier<00:03:51.030> that<00:03:51.479> 5<00:03:52.049> megabits<00:03:52.530> per<00:03:52.650> second<00:03:53.040> less

00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:53.250 
earlier that 5 megabits per second less

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:55.009 
earlier that 5 megabits per second less
than<00:03:53.280> this<00:03:53.669> will<00:03:54.180> create<00:03:54.389> about<00:03:54.720> a<00:03:54.750> two<00:03:54.989> hour

00:03:55.009 --> 00:03:55.019 
than this will create about a two hour

00:03:55.019 --> 00:03:57.860 
than this will create about a two hour
DVD<00:03:56.009> so<00:03:56.370> can<00:03:56.609> you<00:03:56.699> go<00:03:56.909> less<00:03:57.180> than<00:03:57.209> this<00:03:57.569> and<00:03:57.810> the

00:03:57.860 --> 00:03:57.870 
DVD so can you go less than this and the

00:03:57.870 --> 00:04:00.020 
DVD so can you go less than this and the
default<00:03:58.199> transcon<00:03:58.650> settings<00:03:59.009> you<00:03:59.099> can't<00:03:59.400> but

00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:00.030 
default transcon settings you can't but

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:02.270 
default transcon settings you can't but
if<00:04:00.150> your<00:04:00.389> project<00:04:00.989> is<00:04:01.139> going<00:04:01.349> to<00:04:01.680> be<00:04:01.949> such<00:04:02.250> that

00:04:02.270 --> 00:04:02.280 
if your project is going to be such that

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:04.969 
if your project is going to be such that
it<00:04:02.699> needs<00:04:02.909> to<00:04:03.090> be<00:04:03.209> compressed<00:04:03.569> at<00:04:03.840> less<00:04:04.259> than<00:04:04.290> 6

00:04:04.969 --> 00:04:04.979 
it needs to be compressed at less than 6

00:04:04.979 --> 00:04:07.580 
it needs to be compressed at less than 6
then<00:04:05.579> encore<00:04:06.000> will<00:04:06.180> automatically<00:04:06.900> change<00:04:07.349> it

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:07.590 
then encore will automatically change it

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:09.259 
then encore will automatically change it
to<00:04:07.769> whatever<00:04:07.949> you<00:04:08.189> need<00:04:08.340> to<00:04:08.489> do<00:04:08.639> to<00:04:08.849> compress

00:04:09.259 --> 00:04:09.269 
to whatever you need to do to compress

00:04:09.269 --> 00:04:10.999 
to whatever you need to do to compress
and<00:04:09.810> again<00:04:10.049> though<00:04:10.169> if<00:04:10.290> you<00:04:10.379> get<00:04:10.530> much<00:04:10.739> above

00:04:10.999 --> 00:04:11.009 
and again though if you get much above

00:04:11.009 --> 00:04:12.499 
and again though if you get much above
two<00:04:11.159> hours<00:04:11.459> the<00:04:11.669> compression<00:04:12.090> will<00:04:12.120> be<00:04:12.269> too

00:04:12.499 --> 00:04:12.509 
two hours the compression will be too

00:04:12.509 --> 00:04:13.819 
two hours the compression will be too
much<00:04:12.750> for<00:04:12.930> it<00:04:13.019> to<00:04:13.079> be<00:04:13.199> any<00:04:13.290> good<00:04:13.409> you<00:04:13.680> really

00:04:13.819 --> 00:04:13.829 
much for it to be any good you really

00:04:13.829 --> 00:04:15.949 
much for it to be any good you really
need<00:04:13.979> to<00:04:14.069> switch<00:04:14.310> over<00:04:14.609> to<00:04:14.639> a<00:04:14.790> dual<00:04:15.120> layer<00:04:15.419> DVD

00:04:15.949 --> 00:04:15.959 
need to switch over to a dual layer DVD

00:04:15.959 --> 00:04:17.240 
need to switch over to a dual layer DVD
to<00:04:16.109> make<00:04:16.289> sure<00:04:16.409> you<00:04:16.530> don't<00:04:16.739> have<00:04:16.949> lousy

00:04:17.240 --> 00:04:17.250 
to make sure you don't have lousy

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:19.219 
to make sure you don't have lousy
compression<00:04:17.909> let<00:04:18.419> me<00:04:18.509> see<00:04:18.659> how<00:04:18.720> you<00:04:18.750> can<00:04:18.989> deal

00:04:19.219 --> 00:04:19.229 
compression let me see how you can deal

00:04:19.229 --> 00:04:21.020 
compression let me see how you can deal
with<00:04:19.259> the<00:04:19.709> transcode<00:04:20.280> settings<00:04:20.669> here<00:04:20.880> I'm

00:04:21.020 --> 00:04:21.030 
with the transcode settings here I'm

00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:22.310 
with the transcode settings here I'm
going<00:04:21.150> to<00:04:21.239> change<00:04:21.570> them<00:04:21.810> and<00:04:21.930> see<00:04:22.079> how<00:04:22.200> they

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:22.320 
going to change them and see how they

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:23.930 
going to change them and see how they
show<00:04:22.529> up<00:04:22.710> over<00:04:22.830> here<00:04:22.950> in<00:04:23.159> the<00:04:23.250> blu-ray<00:04:23.520> side<00:04:23.789> of

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:23.940 
show up over here in the blu-ray side of

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:25.760 
show up over here in the blu-ray side of
things<00:04:24.139> clicking<00:04:25.139> on<00:04:25.260> this<00:04:25.349> button<00:04:25.620> will

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:25.770 
things clicking on this button will

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:27.200

allow<00:04:26.370> me<00:04:26.490> to<00:04:26.520> change

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:27.210 
allow me to change

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:29.510 
allow me to change
default<00:04:27.630> to<00:04:27.750> transcode<00:04:28.139> settings<00:04:28.680> so<00:04:29.250> I'll<00:04:29.340> do

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:29.520 
default to transcode settings so I'll do

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:30.920 
default to transcode settings so I'll do
it<00:04:29.610> for<00:04:29.729> blu-ray<00:04:29.940> cuz<00:04:30.270> that<00:04:30.419> will<00:04:30.600> show<00:04:30.840> up

00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:30.930 
it for blu-ray cuz that will show up

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:32.300 
it for blu-ray cuz that will show up
right<00:04:31.020> here<00:04:31.139> as<00:04:31.350> we<00:04:31.470> watch<00:04:31.710> here<00:04:32.039> so<00:04:32.250> I'll

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:32.310 
right here as we watch here so I'll

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:34.730 
right here as we watch here so I'll
switch<00:04:32.520> over<00:04:32.669> and<00:04:32.940> we'll<00:04:33.690> just<00:04:33.810> go<00:04:34.080> instead<00:04:34.500> of

00:04:34.730 --> 00:04:34.740 
switch over and we'll just go instead of

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:37.010 
switch over and we'll just go instead of
15<00:04:35.669> megabits<00:04:36.150> per<00:04:36.240> second<00:04:36.660> for<00:04:36.720> the<00:04:36.810> default

15 megabits per second for the default

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:39.230 
15 megabits per second for the default

setting we'll go for the top and now the
top<00:04:39.479> end<00:04:39.720> here<00:04:39.900> is<00:04:39.990> 40<00:04:40.440> megabits<00:04:40.830> per<00:04:40.949> second

00:04:41.420 --> 00:04:41.430

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:43.530 
but the legal top end for the blu-ray

00:04:43.530 --> 00:04:46.520 
but the legal top end for the blu-ray

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:46.530 
spec is 48 megabits per second when you

00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:48.140 
spec is 48 megabits per second when you
combine<00:04:46.860> both<00:04:46.889> audio<00:04:47.460> and<00:04:47.610> video<00:04:47.849> and<00:04:48.000> my

combine both audio and video and my

00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:49.820 
combine both audio and video and my
guests<00:04:48.569> here<00:04:48.750> that<00:04:48.930> the<00:04:49.050> Adobe<00:04:49.500> engineers

00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:49.830 
guests here that the Adobe engineers

00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:51.920 
guests here that the Adobe engineers
really<00:04:50.069> intended<00:04:50.430> to<00:04:50.520> say<00:04:50.699> maximum<00:04:51.180> video<00:04:51.660> bit

00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:51.930 
really intended to say maximum video bit

00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:53.960 
really intended to say maximum video bit
rate<00:04:51.960> instead<00:04:52.319> of<00:04:52.440> audio<00:04:52.830> video<00:04:53.039> but<00:04:53.789> many

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:53.970 
rate instead of audio video but many

00:04:53.970 --> 00:04:56.150 
rate instead of audio video but many
rate<00:04:54.180> 40<00:04:54.840> is<00:04:54.930> the<00:04:54.960> top<00:04:55.229> it's<00:04:55.470> available<00:04:55.710> and<00:04:56.099> I

00:04:56.150 --> 00:04:56.160 
rate 40 is the top it's available and I

00:04:56.160 --> 00:04:57.589 
rate 40 is the top it's available and I
think<00:04:56.190> what<00:04:56.550> it<00:04:56.639> means<00:04:56.819> is<00:04:57.060> just<00:04:57.300> video

00:04:57.589 --> 00:04:57.599 
think what it means is just video

00:04:57.599 --> 00:04:59.270 
think what it means is just video
bitrate<00:04:57.870> not<00:04:58.229> audio<00:04:58.590> video<00:04:58.860> because<00:04:59.039> audio

00:04:59.270 --> 00:04:59.280 
bitrate not audio video because audio

00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:01.730 
bitrate not audio video because audio
video<00:04:59.520> max<00:04:59.789> is<00:05:00.030> 48<00:05:00.479> nevertheless<00:05:00.990> we'll<00:05:01.560> take

00:05:01.730 --> 00:05:01.740 
video max is 48 nevertheless we'll take

00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:03.379 
video max is 48 nevertheless we'll take
the<00:05:01.919> top<00:05:02.099> and<00:05:02.130> there<00:05:02.759> and<00:05:03.000> we'll<00:05:03.120> keep<00:05:03.240> the

00:05:03.379 --> 00:05:03.389 
the top and there and we'll keep the

00:05:03.389 --> 00:05:05.330 
the top and there and we'll keep the

00:05:11.839 --> 00:05:11.849 
here watch what happens over here it's

00:05:11.849 --> 00:05:14.510 
here watch what happens over here it's
gonna<00:05:11.970> go<00:05:12.150> from<00:05:12.270> 1.0<00:05:12.840> 1<00:05:13.110> let's<00:05:13.349> say<00:05:13.520> to

00:05:14.510 --> 00:05:14.520 
gonna go from 1.0 1 let's say to

00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:17.180 
gonna go from 1.0 1 let's say to
something<00:05:14.910> else<00:05:15.120> here<00:05:15.509> we<00:05:15.599> go<00:05:15.750> boom<00:05:16.530> 1<00:05:16.889> point<00:05:17.160> 1

00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:17.190 
something else here we go boom 1 point 1

00:05:17.190 --> 00:05:19.510 
something else here we go boom 1 point 1
4<00:05:17.520> it<00:05:17.639> went<00:05:17.820> up<00:05:17.910> point<00:05:18.300> 1<00:05:18.599> 3<00:05:18.630> gigabytes

00:05:19.510 --> 00:05:19.520 
4 it went up point 1 3 gigabytes

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:21.320 
4 it went up point 1 3 gigabytes
essentially<00:05:20.520> a<00:05:20.550> hundred<00:05:20.909> and<00:05:21.060> thirty

00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:21.330 
essentially a hundred and thirty

00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:24.200 
essentially a hundred and thirty
megabytes<00:05:21.900> so<00:05:22.080> by<00:05:22.530> increasing<00:05:23.039> the<00:05:23.370> quality

00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:24.210 
megabytes so by increasing the quality

00:05:24.210 --> 00:05:27.260 
megabytes so by increasing the quality
of<00:05:24.419> the<00:05:24.900> blu-ray<00:05:25.590> compression<00:05:26.400> we<00:05:26.849> increase

00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:27.270 
of the blu-ray compression we increase

00:05:27.270 --> 00:05:29.240 
of the blu-ray compression we increase
the<00:05:27.449> predicted<00:05:27.990> file<00:05:28.259> size<00:05:28.650> that's<00:05:28.919> going<00:05:29.159> to

00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:29.250 
the predicted file size that's going to

00:05:29.250 --> 00:05:31.339 
the predicted file size that's going to
go<00:05:29.340> on<00:05:29.580> this<00:05:29.789> DVD<00:05:30.060> I<00:05:30.539> want<00:05:31.020> to<00:05:31.080> show<00:05:31.169> you<00:05:31.229> what

00:05:31.339 --> 00:05:31.349 
go on this DVD I want to show you what

00:05:31.349 --> 00:05:33.529 
go on this DVD I want to show you what
happens<00:05:31.740> if<00:05:31.860> you<00:05:32.190> change<00:05:32.520> the<00:05:33.000> compression

00:05:33.529 --> 00:05:33.539 
happens if you change the compression

00:05:33.539 --> 00:05:35.870 
happens if you change the compression
for<00:05:33.810> a<00:05:33.840> single<00:05:34.440> asset<00:05:34.680> and<00:05:35.490> to<00:05:35.550> see<00:05:35.729> that

00:05:35.870 --> 00:05:35.880 
for a single asset and to see that

00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:37.279 
for a single asset and to see that
happen<00:05:36.180> in<00:05:36.300> real<00:05:36.330> time<00:05:36.720> I'm<00:05:36.930> going<00:05:37.080> to<00:05:37.139> drag

00:05:37.279 --> 00:05:37.289 
happen in real time I'm going to drag

00:05:37.289 --> 00:05:38.990 
happen in real time I'm going to drag
this<00:05:37.470> guy<00:05:37.590> to<00:05:37.740> a<00:05:37.860> different<00:05:38.370> panel<00:05:38.820> over<00:05:38.909> here

00:05:38.990 --> 00:05:39.000 
this guy to a different panel over here

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:41.390 
this guy to a different panel over here
so<00:05:39.330> you<00:05:39.419> can<00:05:39.509> see<00:05:40.199> that<00:05:40.380> guy<00:05:40.620> changed<00:05:40.979> while<00:05:41.370> I

00:05:41.390 --> 00:05:41.400 
so you can see that guy changed while I

00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:42.740 
so you can see that guy changed while I
changed<00:05:41.820> something<00:05:42.000> inside<00:05:42.240> the<00:05:42.539> project

00:05:42.740 --> 00:05:42.750 
changed something inside the project

00:05:42.750 --> 00:05:44.120 
changed something inside the project
panels<00:05:43.259> and<00:05:43.380> we<00:05:43.469> expand<00:05:43.770> this<00:05:43.860> for<00:05:44.039> you<00:05:44.099> a

00:05:44.120 --> 00:05:44.130 
panels and we expand this for you a

00:05:44.130 --> 00:05:46.249 
panels and we expand this for you a
little<00:05:44.190> bit<00:05:44.400> there<00:05:44.610> so<00:05:44.669> you<00:05:44.880> can<00:05:44.969> see<00:05:45.150> it<00:05:45.300> there

00:05:46.249 --> 00:05:46.259 
little bit there so you can see it there

00:05:46.259 --> 00:05:47.870 
little bit there so you can see it there
we<00:05:46.320> go<00:05:46.469> I'm<00:05:46.680> going<00:05:47.039> to<00:05:47.190> go<00:05:47.250> to<00:05:47.310> the<00:05:47.460> project

00:05:47.870 --> 00:05:47.880 
we go I'm going to go to the project

00:05:47.880 --> 00:05:50.149 
we go I'm going to go to the project
panel<00:05:48.030> and<00:05:48.300> just<00:05:48.810> change<00:05:49.169> the<00:05:49.560> compression

00:05:50.149 --> 00:05:50.159 
panel and just change the compression

00:05:50.159 --> 00:05:52.159 
panel and just change the compression
scheme<00:05:50.639> for<00:05:51.090> one<00:05:51.270> of<00:05:51.360> these<00:05:51.449> files<00:05:51.750> we'll<00:05:52.050> go

00:05:52.159 --> 00:05:52.169 
scheme for one of these files we'll go

00:05:52.169 --> 00:05:53.959 
scheme for one of these files we'll go

single<00:06:47.630> file<00:06:47.930> here<00:06:48.290> boom<00:06:49.070> 1.26<00:06:50.030> so<00:06:50.270> more<00:06:50.479> than

00:06:50.590 --> 00:06:50.600 
single file here boom 1.26 so more than

00:06:50.600 --> 00:06:52.779 
single file here boom 1.26 so more than
100<00:06:50.900> megabytes<00:06:51.320> more<00:06:51.800> just<00:06:52.430> because<00:06:52.580> we

00:06:52.779 --> 00:06:52.789 
100 megabytes more just because we

00:06:52.789 --> 00:06:54.219 
100 megabytes more just because we
decided<00:06:53.210> the<00:06:53.270> transcript<00:06:53.720> this<00:06:53.870> guy<00:06:54.050> at<00:06:54.169> a

00:06:54.229 --> 00:06:56.529 
decided the transcript this guy at a
higher<00:06:54.560> bitrate<00:06:55.070> so<00:06:55.880> that's<00:06:56.060> the<00:06:56.180> basic

00:06:56.529 --> 00:06:56.539 
higher bitrate so that's the basic

00:06:56.539 --> 00:06:58.360 
higher bitrate so that's the basic
process<00:06:56.570> you<00:06:57.139> need<00:06:57.350> to<00:06:57.530> think<00:06:57.800> about<00:06:58.070> when

00:06:58.360 --> 00:06:58.370 
process you need to think about when

00:06:58.370 --> 00:07:00.100 
process you need to think about when
you're<00:06:58.490> considering<00:06:58.970> the<00:06:59.180> length<00:06:59.690> of<00:06:59.930> the

material inside your project you know

00:07:02.150 --> 00:07:03.610 
material inside your project you know
the<00:07:02.300> ballpark<00:07:02.690> figure<00:07:02.990> for<00:07:03.020> two<00:07:03.320> hours<00:07:03.590> for
