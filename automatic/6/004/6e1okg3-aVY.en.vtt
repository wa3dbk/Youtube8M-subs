 In recent years, the global food crisis has worsened according to the 

00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:10.840
 results that the last summit of the organization of the nations 

00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:15.590
 united for agriculture and food fao carried out in 2008 the 

00:00:15.590 --> 00:00:18.600
 number of chronically hungry people around the world approaches 

00:00:18.599 --> 00:00:20.509
 the 900 million 

00:00:20.509 --> 00:00:23.509
 but of children with malnutrition exceeds 200 million 

00:00:25.179 --> 00:00:28.789
 there are currently 30 and one countries that depend on humanitarian aid for 

00:00:28.789 --> 00:00:30.429
 feed its inhabitants 

00:00:30.429 --> 00:00:34.160

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:42.740

 in Asia are ponce the countries whose food situation is critical between

 problems of poverty and behind or for its inhabitants 

00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:02.230
 In Latin America the most serious situation is experienced by Bolivia 

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:06.070
 and in Europe the Republic of Moldova located in the eastern part of 

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:09.820
 continent is the country with the most precarious situation according to fao 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:14.870
 most of these countries lack the necessary resources to solve 

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:17.350
 your food safety problems 

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:21.009
 that are generated by a combination of factors such as lack of food or 

00:01:21.009 --> 00:01:22.729
 limited access to them 

00:01:22.729 --> 00:01:26.600
 and serious but localized problems like the climatic changes that produce 

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:30.600
 droughts or excessive rains long-term armed conflicts

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:44.659
 for the UN Secretary-General ban ki-moon for much of the solution 

00:01:44.659 --> 00:01:47.510
 is in the political will of the governments of the world 

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:50.830
 who should avoid unflattering measures for poor countries 

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:54.540
 as agricultural protectionism through which the 

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:57.540
 export of basic products and importation is prevented 

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:01.850
 seriously affecting the stability of farmers in countries with 

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:04.120
 worse economic conditions 

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:05.759

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:18.140
 nations were called to oppose such measures immediately release the

00:02:24.149 --> 00:02:28.359
 the UN offered 200 million dollars to farmers in the regions most 

00:02:28.359 --> 00:02:31.289
 affected to encourage the production of food 

00:02:31.289 --> 00:02:34.599
 important support if we take into account that many of the countries that have 

00:02:34.599 --> 00:02:37.509
 managed to advance in the fight against hunger 

00:02:37.509 --> 00:02:40.899
 with agricultural growth rates above average 

00:02:40.899 --> 00:02:44.539
 the discussions also revolve around biofuels according to the 

00:02:44.539 --> 00:02:48.039
 studies the arable land worldwide is not enough to produce the 

00:02:48.039 --> 00:02:51.209
 food of the 6 billion inhabitants of planet earth 

00:02:51.209 --> 00:02:55.260
 which makes it even more serious that many of these soils are defined when planted 

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:56.409
 corn 

00:02:56.409 --> 00:02:59.930
 wheat and sugarcane as raw material to generate biofuels 

00:03:01.759 --> 00:03:05.949
 One of the objectives of the FAO for 2015 is to reduce by half the number of 

00:03:05.949 --> 00:03:08.509
 people who are hungry all over the world 

00:03:08.509 --> 00:03:12.629
 However, the panorama is not encouraging if one takes into account that according to 

00:03:12.629 --> 00:03:15.819
 calculations of the organization the prices of the food will remain 

00:03:15.819 --> 00:03:17.770
 elevated in the years to come 

00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:21.700
 and it will take between 15 and 20 billion dollars per year 

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:22.790
 to overcome the crisis
