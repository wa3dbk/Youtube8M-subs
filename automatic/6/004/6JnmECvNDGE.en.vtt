00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.990
 hello friends of youtube good time to 

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:06.210
 you a video in which I will debate with 

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:08.880
 You are a subject I will comment on a 

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:12.509
 subject in which it is worth 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:14.580
 buying a notebook or tablet is a 

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:16.470
 doubt a lot of people listen in the forums of 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:18.660
 internet when I went to buy too 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:21.180
 I even thought about replacing a tablet 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:22.980
 for one for my notebook pick up on selling 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:25.050
 a notebook is left with the tablet then 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:26.760
 Let's comment and for what kind of 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:28.349
 most recommended user you have a 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:30.170
 notebook a tablet I'm considering 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:32.850
 here in this video if you have not 

00:00:30.170 --> 00:00:34.260
 neither is the case you want 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:37.140
 discard the notebook to have a 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:38.760
 tablet or vice versa good when you I 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:39.960
 I'm just making a video in case you do not 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:42.780
 have one of the two 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:45.360
 so let's go to the beginning of 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:46.530
 talk a notebook a tablet replaces 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:50.190
 a laptop 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:52.039
 neither the stick nor think longer a 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:55.140
 attribute that replaces tablet 

00:00:52.039 --> 00:00:57.960
 practically yes practically yes 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:59.579
 listen to what I have to say, but no 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:01.620
 so you do not have either 

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:03.359
 you should buy everything depends on the profile 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:05.489
 you are the money you have 

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:07.920
 available because clearly you see 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:09.600
 clearly notebooks cost a lot 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:11.490
 more than a tablet will buy a 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:14.130
 notebook top or a top one tablet 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:16.740
 topic is much more expensive, right? 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:18.720
 So who is the most recommended for? 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:21.000
 The tablet or tablet is most recommended by 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:23.460
 people who make more casual use of 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.439
 internet or an electronic device 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:28.020
 that people who will use networks 

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:29.220
 to social networks and if some 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:32.280
 pages with some 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:33.750
 surveys play né play many times is 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:35.400
 better on your tablet than on your computer 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:37.079
 that people do not have a notion 

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:38.250
 settings to be installing 

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:39.479
 these things then on the tablet is very 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:42.240
 simplified you download the application 

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:44.670
 but it 's a game, just install it if it already 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:45.720
 go types and google play let 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:48.329
 install for example that in the case of 

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:49.380
 android is there to download it is 

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:50.880
 Why are you going to shoot? 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:53.759
 so you do not have to worry about 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:55.130
 setup with nothing you downloaded ran 

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:57.689
 understood do not have any concern 

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:59.939
 as they were without the social networks and will 

00:01:57.689 --> 00:02:01.229
 edit a little text here another one goes there 

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:03.240
 open humor websites 

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:05.820
 we knew how I said some issues 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:07.829
 very light but very simple image 

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:09.349
 with the very casual issues that the person 

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:10.619
 does not make the most 

00:02:09.349 --> 00:02:12.930
 simplified 

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:13.460
 then it is a simpler use for a 

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:16.520
 person 

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:17.840
 only a child or an adult so the 

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:20.720
 adolescent who has been using a 

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:22.070
 the Internet and electronic as a 

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:23.810
 all of you will use a more 

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:25.040
 simplified approach and which is a 

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:27.980
 A little more agility does not want to heat up 

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:31.610
 Head with nothing, do not look for anything. 

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:34.250
 more than a simplicity and that's it 

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:36.680
 so it's because a person 

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:40.100
 should buy a notebook and not the 

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:42.110
 Next laptop tablet you do a lot 

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:43.760
 more things you would not do on the tablet 

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:45.920
 has things and makes a tablet not doing 

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:47.570
 a notebook for example some features 

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:49.640
 that touch offers some types of 

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:51.230
 editing some things how to 

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:52.730
 You some cool games that you can 

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:55.010
 play only some applications that only 

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:56.300
 there for touch devices will not 

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:59.060
 can play a notebook 

00:02:56.300 --> 00:03:01.010
 so one more notebook is great 

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:03.380
 why man let's consider windows 

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:05.480
 né windows face you do everything you open 

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:07.100
 any web page you edit 

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:09.290
 that you want depending on the 

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:11.540
 phase setup can edit photos with 

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:13.610
 photoshop you can edit videos with the 

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:15.890
 move that sony vegas and everything else 

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:16.940
 you can install apps from everything 

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:19.970
 a lot depending on the configuration 

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:23.060
 you can install games then a 

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:24.410
 notebook is a much larger range of 

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:26.150
 things besides for example a notebook 

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:28.310
 has much better connectivity with 

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:30.710
 televisions with printers and 

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:32.870
 peripherals thing that the tablet even has 

00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:35.570
 but it is not so vast and so easy to 

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:37.370
 connectivity that the notebook has then 

00:03:35.570 --> 00:03:39.110
 how to you a notebook with 

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:41.630
 user that will take more seriously what 

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:43.610
 it will use it is to arrive here 

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:45.170
 user who understands more computer 

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:46.010
 technology will probably want a 

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:47.960
 notebook 

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:49.790
 but if you have a notebook make up 

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:52.160
 buy a tablet here comes the other question 

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:53.150
 It's good if you have the money to invest. 

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:55.970
 on tablet 

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:57.710
 It's up to you if you have the 

00:03:55.970 --> 00:03:59.060
 a very good thing many times you 

00:03:57.710 --> 00:04:00.560
 goes to a place that does not want to take a 

00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:02.210
 notebook or do not need to either 

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:04.670
 so we have some internet in that 

00:04:02.210 --> 00:04:07.070
 place has more faisal my tablet that 

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:08.870
 I intend to buy for example it has 3g only 

00:04:07.070 --> 00:04:11.420
 I want on the internet little social network 

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:12.950
 I want to play a game is better. 

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:14.450
 the tablet then if you have money to 

00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:15.410
 Invest if you have a notebook. 

00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:17.540
 there are 

00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:18.560
 confronted helm for 500 real and already 

00:04:17.540 --> 00:04:20.780
 especially then you have a 

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:23.570
 notebook a result so expensive right then 

00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:26.000
 you buy a tablet to take a 

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:26.389
 places you do not want notebook 

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.610
 by tel 

00:04:26.389 --> 00:04:30.499
 the mother of the notebook for the 

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:33.289
 it would have to be smaller than the tablet 

00:04:30.499 --> 00:04:35.900
 so the tablet is a good complement to 

00:04:33.289 --> 00:04:38.779
 Who has a notebook understands more and me? 

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:40.669
 Let's just say I 'll tell you, it's not 

00:04:38.779 --> 00:04:42.169
 is not essential but it is a 

00:04:40.669 --> 00:04:43.849
 cool add if you have money 

00:04:42.169 --> 00:04:46.460
 to invest in a tablet 

00:04:43.849 --> 00:04:48.050
 So, but there are people who 

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:49.999
 There were 5,000 more 

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:52.460
 simple you have little money because 

00:04:49.999 --> 00:04:55.699
 I want you to buy a good tablet, okay? 

00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:57.229
 né as a good relation and will run most 

00:04:55.699 --> 00:04:59.810
 most games is 

00:04:57.229 --> 00:05:03.259
 and R $ 500 and R $ 600 in the 

00:04:59.810 --> 00:05:06.139
 maximum a good tablet while the notebook 

00:05:03.259 --> 00:05:08.930
 good will pay at least one thousand and one hundred thousand 

00:05:06.139 --> 00:05:11.029
 Actual minimum of at least one notebook 

00:05:08.930 --> 00:05:12.919
 which will soon be out of date 

00:05:11.029 --> 00:05:14.930
 then for most people and it will 

00:05:12.919 --> 00:05:16.819
 give to your child and tals can give a 

00:05:14.930 --> 00:05:19.580
 tablet because in most cases it will 

00:05:16.819 --> 00:05:21.680
 be more servicing as I told you if you 

00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:23.599
 will not do anything very complex and 

00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:25.509
 It's going to make things very complex go out with 

00:05:23.599 --> 00:05:27.770
 comes a notebook 

00:05:25.509 --> 00:05:29.749
 ambon left yesterday once again to talk 

00:05:27.770 --> 00:05:31.490
 for you but I think it was just that 

00:05:29.749 --> 00:05:34.639
 matter of which notebook things 

00:05:31.490 --> 00:05:36.620
 complex internet tablet and user 

00:05:34.639 --> 00:05:38.810
 casual understood then this is what 

00:05:36.620 --> 00:05:39.979
 define for you if you have a reason to buy 

00:05:38.810 --> 00:05:42.529
 a tablet will serve as a complement 

00:05:39.979 --> 00:05:44.990
 good as portability can lead to 

00:05:42.529 --> 00:05:46.490
 place more portable and but I think 

00:05:44.990 --> 00:05:48.050
 essential for everyone to have a 

00:05:46.490 --> 00:05:49.460
 A notebook computer in the house is 

00:05:48.050 --> 00:05:52.129
 essential today, everyone has a 

00:05:49.460 --> 00:05:53.779
 computer for the sake of connectivity 

00:05:52.129 --> 00:05:55.399
 How are you talking to printers? 

00:05:53.779 --> 00:05:57.620
 you have a cell phone that 

00:05:55.399 --> 00:05:59.149
 connect a computer then but here in the 

00:05:57.620 --> 00:06:01.250
 if you do not mind talking book 

00:05:59.149 --> 00:06:02.810
 but then I think I was able to express 

00:06:01.250 --> 00:06:03.860
 I do not think so either of you the way 

00:06:02.810 --> 00:06:05.449
 I wanted 

00:06:03.860 --> 00:06:07.399
 the arguments I wanted to use here for 

00:06:05.449 --> 00:06:09.289
 explain the importance to those who serve 

00:06:07.399 --> 00:06:10.370
 plus the tablet for the fastest and one 

00:06:09.289 --> 00:06:11.870
 notebook 

00:06:10.370 --> 00:06:13.399
 Well, people, but that's what I 

00:06:11.870 --> 00:06:14.360
 I had to show you guys to talk. 

00:06:13.399 --> 00:06:15.949
 for you here 

00:06:14.360 --> 00:06:18.439
 Andrade was not shown much more 

00:06:15.949 --> 00:06:20.779
 spoken on the need to give your taste 

00:06:18.439 --> 00:06:22.069
 And if you liked the video, did you like the 

00:06:20.779 --> 00:06:24.620
