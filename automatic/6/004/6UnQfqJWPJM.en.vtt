00:00:08.950 --> 00:00:13.490
 what the economy is yes 

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:15.469
 Meanwhile, the health market is the big one 

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:17.119
 has become a driving force and you have to 

00:00:15.469 --> 00:00:19.369
 not always in our area 

00:00:17.119 --> 00:00:21.380
 Do more for less 

00:00:19.369 --> 00:00:23.210
 was level health market financially 

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:25.160
 limited we tried the 

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:27.430
 improve workflow and the whole 

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:30.290
 just more efficient 

00:00:27.430 --> 00:00:32.840
 because we work in an acute hospital 

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:34.760
 yes 24 hours a day and at night 

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:37.010
 So we're with the hospital too 

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:39.320
 to supply stored blood 

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:41.059
 and just after the local come in 

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:42.769
 I have to decide the day they do 

00:00:41.059 --> 00:00:46.039
 from the analytic or make the first 

00:00:42.769 --> 00:00:48.079
 conserve output if we have been so far 

00:00:46.039 --> 00:00:50.210
 from one device to another device in 

00:00:48.079 --> 00:00:52.370
 Persons had to wear so the mts 

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:54.530
 was the one that we with 1 

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:56.839
 system maybe 80 our samples 

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:58.940
 can cover and now on a sample 

00:00:56.839 --> 00:01:00.649
 also system is put on it and the 

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:02.769
 rest automatically 

00:01:00.649 --> 00:01:02.769
 can 

00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:08.380
 for me personally has changed 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:09.880
 that the processing of the samples now 

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:12.790
 has become much easier 

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:14.380
 Even the processes are simply improved 

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:16.930
 we do not have to go back now 

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:19.510
 hand unscrew the samples and also 

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:21.760
 no longer archive that works 

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:25.390
 now fully automatic and thereby 

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:27.340
 stay tuned on the 

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:31.240
 to focus on things that are important 

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:33.210
 how the evaluation of the results and the 

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:35.530
 maintenance of the equipment 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:37.390
 you have to say that the systems today 

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:39.250
 all work very similar but there are 

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:41.470
 in particular portable here at the system 

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:44.170
 even these individual transport 

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:46.390
 fast access to the primary, the 

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:48.430
 means the sample passes the device over the 

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:49.900
 device takes out what it needs and 

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:52.840
 the sample immediately free again 

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:54.700
 and the time the sample disappeared 

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:57.420
 for us this is not shorter what 

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:57.420
 with other systems 

00:01:58.690 --> 00:02:02.830
 In the long term, automation is for us 

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:04.930
 a great advantage and also a 

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:07.150
 necessity was a very young one 

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:09.640
 Businesses are slow though 

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:11.440
 grow steadily and our automation with 

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:12.670
 adapted to the growth of our laboratory 

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:14.860
 may be it means we have 

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:16.690
 various platform possibilities the 

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:17.980
 be extended and if that then 

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:19.840
 we can reach the next one 

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:21.430
 skip the platform and say we are 

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:23.410
 become so big with whom it is easy to 

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:25.090
 a new system over where we just left 

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:27.360
 work faster and more curves 

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:27.360
 can
