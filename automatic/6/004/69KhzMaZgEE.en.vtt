my lego hidden blade it's pretty simple
and<00:00:08.780> is<00:00:09.780> very<00:00:10.620> fun<00:00:10.920> to<00:00:11.070> use<00:00:11.280> I<00:00:12.920> know<00:00:13.920> that<00:00:14.580> a<00:00:14.610> lot

00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:14.820 
and is very fun to use I know that a lot

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:16.460 
and is very fun to use I know that a lot
of<00:00:14.849> people<00:00:15.150> are<00:00:15.269> looking<00:00:15.360> for<00:00:15.719> a<00:00:15.990> hand<00:00:16.260> blade

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:16.470 
of people are looking for a hand blade

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:21.380 
of people are looking for a hand blade
that<00:00:16.800> can<00:00:17.760> launch<00:00:18.300> out<00:00:18.600> and<00:00:19.460> retract<00:00:20.460> but

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:21.390 
that can launch out and retract but

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:24.290 
that can launch out and retract but
trust<00:00:22.380> me<00:00:22.529> is<00:00:22.800> really<00:00:23.340> hard<00:00:23.730> to<00:00:23.850> make<00:00:23.970> one<00:00:24.180> of

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:24.300 
trust me is really hard to make one of

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:26.540 
trust me is really hard to make one of
those<00:00:24.420> but<00:00:25.320> this<00:00:25.529> type<00:00:25.800> is<00:00:26.010> one<00:00:26.220> of<00:00:26.279> the<00:00:26.340> most

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:26.550 
those but this type is one of the most

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:33.440 
those but this type is one of the most
fun<00:00:28.849> it's<00:00:29.849> gravity<00:00:30.179> activate<00:00:30.539> so<00:00:30.779> won't<00:00:32.450> locks

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:33.450 
fun it's gravity activate so won't locks

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:38.080 
fun it's gravity activate so won't locks
into<00:00:33.600> place<00:00:34.880> the<00:00:35.880> ring<00:00:36.329> it<00:00:36.930> syncs<00:00:37.260> back<00:00:37.380> in

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:38.090 
into place the ring it syncs back in

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:42.319 
into place the ring it syncs back in
pretty<00:00:39.090> darn<00:00:39.180> simple<00:00:40.610> works<00:00:41.610> on<00:00:41.820> nylon

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:42.329 
pretty darn simple works on nylon

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:46.700 
pretty darn simple works on nylon
strings<00:00:43.460> pull<00:00:44.460> the<00:00:44.550> blade<00:00:44.730> back<00:00:45.559> now<00:00:46.559> our

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
strings pull the blade back now our

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:48.729 
strings pull the blade back now our
strings<00:00:46.950> work<00:00:47.129> brother<00:00:47.309> because<00:00:47.730> when<00:00:47.940> they

00:00:48.729 --> 00:00:48.739 
strings work brother because when they

00:00:48.739 --> 00:00:52.279 
strings work brother because when they
when<00:00:49.739> they<00:00:49.829> slide<00:00:50.070> against<00:00:50.460> Legos<00:00:51.110> they<00:00:52.110> don't

00:00:52.279 --> 00:00:52.289 
when they slide against Legos they don't

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:54.470 
when they slide against Legos they don't
rip<00:00:52.559> like<00:00:52.770> rubber<00:00:52.980> bands<00:00:53.160> would<00:00:53.370> like<00:00:54.300> when

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
rip like rubber bands would like when

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:56.240 
rip like rubber bands would like when
you<00:00:54.570> have<00:00:54.989> a<00:00:55.020> rubber<00:00:55.170> band<00:00:55.379> slice<00:00:55.980> against

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
you have a rubber band slice against

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:57.439 
you have a rubber band slice against
something<00:00:56.370> like<00:00:56.520> that<00:00:56.670> head<00:00:56.940> of<00:00:57.059> lay<00:00:57.180> cuts

00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:57.449 
something like that head of lay cuts

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:00.410 
something like that head of lay cuts
through<00:00:57.690> it<00:00:57.780> and<00:00:57.930> it<00:00:58.020> snaps<00:00:58.760> so<00:00:59.760> it<00:00:59.850> reduces<00:01:00.149> on

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
through it and it snaps so it reduces on

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:04.490 
through it and it snaps so it reduces on
worrying<00:01:00.989> about<00:01:01.109> it<00:01:01.680> breaking<00:01:01.949> on<00:01:02.219> you

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:06.770 

the<00:01:04.769> blade<00:01:04.949> itself<00:01:05.010> is<00:01:05.369> very<00:01:05.549> simple<00:01:06.150> there's

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:06.780 
the blade itself is very simple there's

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:11.690 
the blade itself is very simple there's
not<00:01:06.900> much<00:01:07.080> to<00:01:07.290> it<00:01:10.040> it's<00:01:11.040> just<00:01:11.100> three<00:01:11.520> of<00:01:11.549> these

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
not much to it it's just three of these

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:15.230 
not much to it it's just three of these
stock<00:01:12.000> pieces<00:01:12.420> pretty<00:01:12.630> much<00:01:13.070> with<00:01:14.119> you<00:01:15.119> know

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
stock pieces pretty much with you know

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:16.969 
stock pieces pretty much with you know
some<00:01:15.390> pieces<00:01:15.960> in<00:01:16.080> between<00:01:16.140> the<00:01:16.439> help<00:01:16.590> locking

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:16.979 
some pieces in between the help locking

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:19.359 
some pieces in between the help locking
place<00:01:17.220> and<00:01:17.490> hold<00:01:17.850> together<00:01:18.000> give<00:01:18.720> it's<00:01:18.840> frame

00:01:19.359 --> 00:01:19.369 
place and hold together give it's frame

00:01:19.369 --> 00:01:24.289 
place and hold together give it's frame
put<00:01:20.369> that<00:01:20.520> stuff<00:01:20.790> up<00:01:22.009> it<00:01:23.009> slides<00:01:23.310> along<00:01:23.460> these

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:24.299 
put that stuff up it slides along these

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:28.280 
put that stuff up it slides along these
a<00:01:24.360> flat<00:01:24.900> pieces<00:01:25.320> and<00:01:26.780> it<00:01:27.780> does<00:01:27.930> the<00:01:28.020> same<00:01:28.170> for

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:28.290 
a flat pieces and it does the same for

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:30.800 
a flat pieces and it does the same for
the<00:01:28.380> size<00:01:28.560> because<00:01:29.180> generically<00:01:30.180> like<00:01:30.479> with

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810 
the size because generically like with

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:32.840 
the size because generically like with
these<00:01:30.930> a<00:01:30.990> regular<00:01:31.710> piece<00:01:31.860> right<00:01:31.979> here<00:01:32.040> it

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850 
these a regular piece right here it

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:33.859 
these a regular piece right here it
would<00:01:32.970> have<00:01:33.090> a<00:01:33.119> lot<00:01:33.299> of<00:01:33.329> ribbon<00:01:33.630> goof<00:01:33.750> around

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:33.869 
would have a lot of ribbon goof around

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:37.850 
would have a lot of ribbon goof around
and<00:01:34.229> you<00:01:35.189> can<00:01:35.369> I<00:01:35.400> don't<00:01:35.549> want<00:01:35.700> that<00:01:35.850> I<00:01:36.530> mean<00:01:37.530> it

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
and you can I don't want that I mean it

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:40.670 
and you can I don't want that I mean it
wouldn't<00:01:38.369> really<00:01:38.579> hurt<00:01:38.880> it<00:01:39.000> too<00:01:39.150> much<00:01:39.329> but<00:01:39.680> so

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.680 
wouldn't really hurt it too much but so

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:44.240 
wouldn't really hurt it too much but so
makes<00:01:40.860> it<00:01:40.950> a<00:01:40.979> lot<00:01:41.070> better<00:01:41.840> I<00:01:42.840> use<00:01:43.530> these<00:01:44.070> type

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250 
makes it a lot better I use these type

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:47.120 
makes it a lot better I use these type
of<00:01:44.280> pieces<00:01:44.490> just<00:01:45.149> flat<00:01:45.420> for<00:01:45.750> the<00:01:45.840> sides<00:01:46.130> hurt

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
of pieces just flat for the sides hurt

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:51.190 
of pieces just flat for the sides hurt
they're<00:01:47.310> from<00:01:47.430> these<00:01:47.579> from<00:01:47.729> behind<00:01:49.280> that

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:51.200 
they're from these from behind that

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:53.870 
they're from these from behind that
there

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:53.880 
there

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:57.590 
there
or<00:01:54.409> you<00:01:55.409> could<00:01:55.560> use<00:01:55.710> like<00:01:55.970> these<00:01:56.970> which<00:01:57.450> I've

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:57.600 
or you could use like these which I've

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:01.219 
or you could use like these which I've
also<00:01:57.810> done<00:01:58.460> I've<00:01:59.460> been<00:01:59.640> here<00:01:59.880> you<00:02:00.030> just<00:02:00.240> take<00:02:00.659> a

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:01.229 
also done I've been here you just take a

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:03.400 
also done I've been here you just take a
piece<00:02:01.590> like<00:02:01.710> this<00:02:01.770> and<00:02:02.160> flip<00:02:02.460> it<00:02:02.550> that<00:02:02.640> way

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:03.410 
piece like this and flip it that way

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:07.550 
piece like this and flip it that way
stick<00:02:04.410> it<00:02:04.500> in<00:02:04.590> like<00:02:04.940> that<00:02:06.229> they<00:02:07.229> both<00:02:07.350> are<00:02:07.500> the

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:07.560 
stick it in like that they both are the

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:08.930 
stick it in like that they both are the
same<00:02:07.650> thing<00:02:07.920> and<00:02:08.100> that'll<00:02:08.310> really<00:02:08.429> stopped<00:02:08.759> it

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:08.940 
same thing and that'll really stopped it

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:10.660 
same thing and that'll really stopped it
as<00:02:09.030> long<00:02:09.179> as<00:02:09.270> it<00:02:09.390> able<00:02:09.990> to<00:02:10.050> keep<00:02:10.200> it<00:02:10.320> sliding

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:10.670 
as long as it able to keep it sliding

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:16.240 
as long as it able to keep it sliding
and<00:02:11.670> that<00:02:11.820> gank<00:02:12.330> on<00:02:12.540> stuff<00:02:12.930> it's<00:02:13.170> fine

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:16.250 

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:20.780 

blocking<00:02:17.250> mechanism<00:02:18.200> super<00:02:19.200> simple<00:02:19.790> it's

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:20.790 
blocking mechanism super simple it's

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:23.480 
blocking mechanism super simple it's
just<00:02:20.850> one<00:02:21.390> piece<00:02:21.690> that<00:02:22.050> is<00:02:22.620> hooked<00:02:22.800> up<00:02:23.010> these

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:23.490 
just one piece that is hooked up these

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:25.550 
just one piece that is hooked up these
little<00:02:23.640> things<00:02:23.910> are<00:02:24.030> just<00:02:24.120> kind<00:02:24.330> of<00:02:24.450> I<00:02:24.720> took

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:25.560 
little things are just kind of I took

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:26.840 
little things are just kind of I took
too<00:02:25.680> much<00:02:25.800> string<00:02:26.130> I<00:02:26.310> just<00:02:26.550> need<00:02:26.640> something

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:26.850 
too much string I just need something

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:29.540 
too much string I just need something
that<00:02:26.940> take<00:02:27.900> more<00:02:28.050> string<00:02:28.290> away<00:02:28.380> because<00:02:28.620> I<00:02:28.920> cut

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:29.550 
that take more string away because I cut

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:33.830 
that take more string away because I cut
too<00:02:29.670> much<00:02:31.790> yeah<00:02:32.790> it<00:02:33.030> just<00:02:33.060> kind<00:02:33.540> of<00:02:33.660> hooks<00:02:33.780> up

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:33.840 
too much yeah it just kind of hooks up

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:36.560 
too much yeah it just kind of hooks up
in<00:02:33.930> there<00:02:34.550> you<00:02:35.550> got<00:02:35.640> this<00:02:35.730> rubber<00:02:35.910> band<00:02:36.180> right

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:36.570 
in there you got this rubber band right

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:40.310 
in there you got this rubber band right
here<00:02:37.550> it<00:02:38.550> goes<00:02:38.730> back<00:02:38.970> and<00:02:39.750> hopes<00:02:39.959> up<00:02:40.080> to<00:02:40.290> a

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:40.320 
here it goes back and hopes up to a

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:46.120 
here it goes back and hopes up to a
piece<00:02:40.500> back<00:02:40.680> here<00:02:41.510> and<00:02:42.510> just<00:02:42.690> pulls<00:02:43.260> that<00:02:43.410> down

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:46.130 

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:50.840 

yeah<00:02:47.130> it's<00:02:47.370> it's<00:02:47.730> real<00:02:47.910> simple<00:02:49.700> doesn't<00:02:50.700> take

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:50.850 
yeah it's it's real simple doesn't take

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:52.040 
yeah it's it's real simple doesn't take
that<00:02:50.970> many<00:02:51.090> pieces<00:02:51.390> if<00:02:51.630> you<00:02:51.660> build<00:02:51.900> it<00:02:51.959> the

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:52.050 
that many pieces if you build it the

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:56.330 
that many pieces if you build it the
right<00:02:52.230> way<00:02:52.380> and<00:02:54.590> I'm<00:02:55.590> not<00:02:55.769> too<00:02:55.950> sure<00:02:56.130> if<00:02:56.160> you

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:56.340 
right way and I'm not too sure if you

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:58.039 
right way and I'm not too sure if you
get<00:02:56.610> any<00:02:56.820> thinner<00:02:57.030> because<00:02:57.450> the<00:02:57.750> thinnest

00:02:58.039 --> 00:02:58.049 
get any thinner because the thinnest

00:02:58.049 --> 00:03:01.699 
get any thinner because the thinnest
I've<00:02:58.200> been<00:02:58.320> able<00:02:58.440> to<00:02:58.560> get<00:02:58.680> this<00:02:58.920> design<00:03:00.530> if<00:03:01.530> you

00:03:01.699 --> 00:03:01.709 
I've been able to get this design if you

00:03:01.709 --> 00:03:05.180 
I've been able to get this design if you
can<00:03:01.950> find<00:03:02.100> a<00:03:02.160> way<00:03:02.250> to<00:03:02.459> do<00:03:02.640> it<00:03:02.790> and<00:03:03.980> post<00:03:04.980> me<00:03:05.130> a

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:05.190 
can find a way to do it and post me a

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:07.670 
can find a way to do it and post me a
comment<00:03:05.430> or<00:03:05.730> some<00:03:05.940> like<00:03:06.090> that<00:03:06.239> cuz<00:03:06.450> I<00:03:06.720> would<00:03:07.019> be

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:07.680 
comment or some like that cuz I would be

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:12.340 
comment or some like that cuz I would be
happy<00:03:07.980> to<00:03:08.070> know<00:03:09.230> I<00:03:10.519> had<00:03:11.519> this<00:03:11.700> piece<00:03:12.030> back<00:03:12.239> here

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:12.350 
happy to know I had this piece back here

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:14.420 
happy to know I had this piece back here
you<00:03:13.350> don't<00:03:13.440> necessarily<00:03:13.620> need<00:03:13.980> one<00:03:14.190> of<00:03:14.220> those

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:14.430 
you don't necessarily need one of those

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:16.430 
you don't necessarily need one of those
but<00:03:14.760> when<00:03:15.540> you<00:03:15.630> have<00:03:15.750> to<00:03:15.840> blade<00:03:16.019> going<00:03:16.230> back

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:16.440 
but when you have to blade going back

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:19.340 
but when you have to blade going back
and<00:03:16.620> forth<00:03:16.890> like<00:03:17.549> when<00:03:17.940> you<00:03:18.030> retract<00:03:18.390> it<00:03:18.540> got<00:03:19.320> a

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:19.350 
and forth like when you retract it got a

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:22.330 
and forth like when you retract it got a
tendency<00:03:19.890> to<00:03:20.370> shoot<00:03:20.760> out<00:03:21.000> the<00:03:21.030> back<00:03:21.480> so

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:22.340 
tendency to shoot out the back so

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:26.360 
tendency to shoot out the back so
retract<00:03:23.340> it<00:03:23.519> and<00:03:23.700> the<00:03:23.760> plate<00:03:23.970> goes<00:03:24.440> woo<00:03:25.440> back

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:26.370 
retract it and the plate goes woo back

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:28.940 
retract it and the plate goes woo back
there<00:03:26.610> and<00:03:26.820> it<00:03:27.060> just<00:03:27.470> it's<00:03:28.470> not<00:03:28.590> that<00:03:28.650> great

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:28.950 
there and it just it's not that great

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:31.490 
there and it just it's not that great
that<00:03:29.850> and<00:03:30.150> when<00:03:30.540> you're<00:03:30.690> walking<00:03:30.989> around<00:03:31.380> with

00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:31.500 
that and when you're walking around with

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:34.400 
that and when you're walking around with
it<00:03:31.590> on<00:03:32.420> the<00:03:33.420> plate<00:03:33.660> you'll<00:03:33.810> fall<00:03:33.989> back<00:03:34.170> there

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:34.410 
it on the plate you'll fall back there

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:37.000 
it on the plate you'll fall back there
and<00:03:34.739> it<00:03:35.610> just<00:03:35.760> kind<00:03:35.970> of<00:03:36.000> dangles<00:03:36.360> a<00:03:36.510> little<00:03:36.750> bit

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:37.010 
and it just kind of dangles a little bit

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:39.410 
and it just kind of dangles a little bit
like<00:03:38.010> I<00:03:38.130> had<00:03:38.340> that<00:03:38.430> they<00:03:38.579> ever<00:03:38.640> one<00:03:38.850> that<00:03:39.030> when

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:39.420 
like I had that they ever one that when

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:41.630 
like I had that they ever one that when
that<00:03:39.510> piece<00:03:39.690> is<00:03:39.810> there<00:03:40.070> has<00:03:41.070> a<00:03:41.100> tendency<00:03:41.549> to

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:41.640 
that piece is there has a tendency to

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:44.060 
that piece is there has a tendency to
bounce<00:03:41.820> right<00:03:41.940> back<00:03:42.060> out<00:03:42.620> as<00:03:43.620> you<00:03:43.769> saw<00:03:43.920> in<00:03:44.010> the

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:44.070 
bounce right back out as you saw in the

00:03:44.070 --> 00:03:47.090 
bounce right back out as you saw in the
first<00:03:44.220> video<00:03:44.370> so<00:03:44.820> I<00:03:45.440> don't<00:03:46.440> know<00:03:46.650> it's<00:03:46.920> like<00:03:46.950> a

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:47.100 
first video so I don't know it's like a

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:49.900 
first video so I don't know it's like a
love-hate<00:03:47.549> relationship<00:03:48.209> with<00:03:48.239> that<00:03:48.390> piece

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:49.910 
love-hate relationship with that piece

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:51.949 
love-hate relationship with that piece
but<00:03:50.910> you<00:03:51.000> don't<00:03:51.150> really<00:03:51.239> need<00:03:51.420> it<00:03:51.570> it<00:03:51.720> doesn't

00:03:51.949 --> 00:03:51.959 
but you don't really need it it doesn't

00:03:51.959 --> 00:03:58.960 
but you don't really need it it doesn't
really<00:03:52.049> matter<00:03:53.269> that's<00:03:54.269> pretty<00:03:55.110> much<00:03:55.230> it

00:03:58.960 --> 00:03:58.970 

00:03:58.970 --> 00:04:01.860 

those<00:03:59.240> comments<00:03:59.600> like<00:04:00.260> it<00:04:00.470> if<00:04:00.590> you<00:04:00.710> do

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:01.870 
those comments like it if you do

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:09.010 
those comments like it if you do
subscribe<00:04:03.460> I'll<00:04:04.460> make<00:04:04.610> more<00:04:04.760> videos<00:04:04.820> I<00:04:06.010> guess
