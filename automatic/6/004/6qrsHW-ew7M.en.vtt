00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:35.060 
idea was to post videos of how it gets
him<00:00:33.660> better<00:00:33.870> at<00:00:34.110> the<00:00:34.200> crucible<00:00:34.590> as<00:00:34.829> that's

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:35.070 
him better at the crucible as that's

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:37.100 
him better at the crucible as that's
what<00:00:35.280> she<00:00:35.520> enjoys<00:00:35.640> most<00:00:36.210> over<00:00:36.630> the<00:00:36.660> missions

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:37.110 
what she enjoys most over the missions

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:39.590 
what she enjoys most over the missions
and<00:00:37.260> obviously<00:00:37.890> as<00:00:38.160> she<00:00:38.670> pretty<00:00:38.940> much<00:00:39.149> started

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 
and obviously as she pretty much started

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:41.900 
and obviously as she pretty much started
playing<00:00:39.809> destiny<00:00:40.110> probably<00:00:41.010> this<00:00:41.280> weekend

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:41.910 
playing destiny probably this weekend

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:43.970 
playing destiny probably this weekend
she<00:00:42.390> obviously<00:00:42.510> isn't<00:00:42.930> the<00:00:43.200> best<00:00:43.379> player<00:00:43.710> and

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980 
she obviously isn't the best player and

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:45.860 
she obviously isn't the best player and
she<00:00:44.520> made<00:00:44.670> her<00:00:44.820> character<00:00:45.300> when<00:00:45.450> destiny

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
she made her character when destiny

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:47.840 
she made her character when destiny
first<00:00:46.170> launched<00:00:46.559> and<00:00:46.860> she<00:00:47.039> got<00:00:47.129> it<00:00:47.280> to<00:00:47.370> 8th<00:00:47.550> and

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850 
first launched and she got it to 8th and

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:49.490 
first launched and she got it to 8th and
about<00:00:48.090> you<00:00:48.539> know<00:00:48.660> like<00:00:48.809> two<00:00:48.989> or<00:00:49.110> three<00:00:49.320> days<00:00:49.469> or

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500 
about you know like two or three days or

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:51.860 
about you know like two or three days or
something<00:00:49.770> and<00:00:50.640> this<00:00:51.090> weekend<00:00:51.480> she<00:00:51.660> managed

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870 
something and this weekend she managed

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:54.080 
something and this weekend she managed
to<00:00:51.960> go<00:00:52.079> from<00:00:52.260> level<00:00:52.410> 8<00:00:52.710> to<00:00:53.309> level<00:00:53.579> 20<00:00:53.910> and<00:00:53.940> I

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.090 
to go from level 8 to level 20 and I

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:55.729 
to go from level 8 to level 20 and I
think<00:00:54.329> that's<00:00:54.449> pretty<00:00:54.660> good<00:00:55.020> for<00:00:55.530> somebody

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739 
think that's pretty good for somebody

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:58.220 
think that's pretty good for somebody
who's<00:00:56.010> never<00:00:56.280> played<00:00:56.699> games<00:00:56.969> previously<00:00:57.539> so

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
who's never played games previously so

00:00:58.230 --> 00:00:59.779 
who's never played games previously so
their<00:00:58.350> aim<00:00:58.500> is<00:00:58.530> to<00:00:58.739> help<00:00:58.890> her<00:00:59.070> get<00:00:59.309> better<00:00:59.520> at<00:00:59.760> a

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
their aim is to help her get better at a

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:01.880 
their aim is to help her get better at a
game<00:01:00.090> she<00:01:00.300> genuinely<00:01:00.600> joys<00:01:01.079> I<00:01:01.350> mean<00:01:01.649> for<00:01:01.800> it'd
