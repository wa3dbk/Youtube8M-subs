hi I'm an McKinnell thanks for joining
in<00:00:03.319> today<00:00:04.319> I<00:00:04.350> want<00:00:04.650> to<00:00:04.740> show<00:00:04.859> you<00:00:04.920> how<00:00:05.130> to

00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:05.190 
in today I want to show you how to

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:07.400 
in today I want to show you how to
create<00:00:05.490> a<00:00:05.609> multiple<00:00:06.210> exposure<00:00:06.660> effect<00:00:07.200> in

00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:07.410 
create a multiple exposure effect in

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:11.450 
create a multiple exposure effect in
Photoshop<00:00:08.010> I<00:00:09.620> find<00:00:10.620> this<00:00:10.769> technique<00:00:11.160> works

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:11.460 
Photoshop I find this technique works

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:14.330 
Photoshop I find this technique works
particularly<00:00:11.969> well<00:00:12.240> on<00:00:12.690> images<00:00:13.349> of<00:00:13.650> flowers

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:14.340 
particularly well on images of flowers

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:17.150 
particularly well on images of flowers
and<00:00:14.610> foliage<00:00:14.790> so<00:00:15.360> I<00:00:15.389> picked<00:00:15.719> this<00:00:16.170> image<00:00:16.560> of

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:17.160 
and foliage so I picked this image of

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:21.109 
and foliage so I picked this image of
these<00:00:17.369> red<00:00:17.580> flowers<00:00:18.000> here<00:00:18.270> to<00:00:18.420> start<00:00:19.939> so<00:00:20.939> what

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:21.119 
these red flowers here to start so what

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:23.000 
these red flowers here to start so what
I'm<00:00:21.210> going<00:00:21.449> to<00:00:21.510> do<00:00:21.720> is<00:00:22.020> duplicate<00:00:22.769> the

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:23.010 
I'm going to do is duplicate the

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:26.290 
I'm going to do is duplicate the
background<00:00:23.130> layer<00:00:23.670> by<00:00:24.410> dragging<00:00:25.410> the<00:00:25.560> layer

00:00:26.290 --> 00:00:26.300 
background layer by dragging the layer

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:29.390 
background layer by dragging the layer
down<00:00:27.300> over<00:00:27.660> to<00:00:27.810> that<00:00:27.930> icon<00:00:28.349> and<00:00:28.619> it<00:00:28.710> creates<00:00:29.039> a

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:29.400 
down over to that icon and it creates a

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:34.010 
down over to that icon and it creates a
new<00:00:30.150> copy<00:00:30.420> of<00:00:30.599> it<00:00:30.920> then<00:00:31.920> I'm<00:00:32.279> going<00:00:33.059> to<00:00:33.180> change

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:34.020 
new copy of it then I'm going to change

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:38.450 
new copy of it then I'm going to change
the<00:00:34.260> opacity<00:00:34.500> of<00:00:34.950> that<00:00:34.980> layer<00:00:35.239> to<00:00:36.239> 30%<00:00:37.460> and

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:38.460 
the opacity of that layer to 30% and

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:41.360 
the opacity of that layer to 30% and
then<00:00:39.270> I'm<00:00:39.450> just<00:00:39.600> going<00:00:39.930> to<00:00:39.989> move<00:00:40.920> this<00:00:41.129> layer

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:41.370 
then I'm just going to move this layer

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:46.430 
then I'm just going to move this layer
over<00:00:42.059> a<00:00:42.090> little<00:00:42.360> bit<00:00:42.710> like<00:00:43.710> that<00:00:45.140> then<00:00:46.140> I'm

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:46.440 
over a little bit like that then I'm

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:48.410 
over a little bit like that then I'm
going<00:00:46.590> to<00:00:46.649> keep<00:00:46.829> doing<00:00:47.010> this<00:00:47.340> another<00:00:48.120> four<00:00:48.390> or

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
going to keep doing this another four or

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:50.240 
going to keep doing this another four or
five<00:00:48.539> times<00:00:48.989> so<00:00:49.350> I<00:00:49.379> take<00:00:49.680> the<00:00:49.800> background

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 
five times so I take the background

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:53.930 
five times so I take the background
layer<00:00:51.020> duplicate<00:00:52.020> it<00:00:52.230> I'm<00:00:53.160> going<00:00:53.430> to<00:00:53.489> drag<00:00:53.760> it

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
layer duplicate it I'm going to drag it

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:56.869 
layer duplicate it I'm going to drag it
up<00:00:54.030> to<00:00:54.059> the<00:00:54.210> top<00:00:54.480> of<00:00:54.660> the<00:00:54.719> stack<00:00:55.670> change<00:00:56.670> the

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 
up to the top of the stack change the

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:01.010 
up to the top of the stack change the
opacity<00:00:57.090> to<00:00:57.660> 30%<00:00:57.690> and<00:00:58.730> then<00:00:59.730> move<00:01:00.690> it<00:01:00.780> over<00:01:00.840> a

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020 
opacity to 30% and then move it over a

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:05.179 
opacity to 30% and then move it over a
little<00:01:01.140> bit<00:01:01.379> so<00:01:03.350> I'll<00:01:04.350> just<00:01:04.530> repeat<00:01:04.920> this<00:01:05.129> a

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:05.189 
little bit so I'll just repeat this a

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:50.910 
little bit so I'll just repeat this a
few<00:01:05.339> more<00:01:05.610> times

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:50.920 

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:55.230 

there<00:01:52.290> now<00:01:53.290> you<00:01:53.350> can<00:01:53.710> see<00:01:54.070> a<00:01:54.400> little<00:01:54.970> bit

00:01:55.230 --> 00:01:55.240 
there now you can see a little bit

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:57.240 
there now you can see a little bit
around<00:01:55.479> the<00:01:55.630> edges<00:01:56.110> you<00:01:56.140> can<00:01:56.350> see<00:01:56.710> the<00:01:56.830> edges

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:57.250 
around the edges you can see the edges

00:01:57.250 --> 00:02:00.510 
around the edges you can see the edges
of<00:01:57.280> the<00:01:57.520> frames<00:01:58.470> so<00:01:59.470> I'm<00:01:59.740> going<00:01:59.920> to<00:01:59.979> crop<00:02:00.220> this

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:00.520 
of the frames so I'm going to crop this

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:04.080 
of the frames so I'm going to crop this
image<00:02:00.840> using<00:02:01.840> the<00:02:01.930> crop<00:02:02.170> tool<00:02:02.439> and<00:02:02.799> just<00:02:03.790> crop

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:04.090 
image using the crop tool and just crop

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:06.210 
image using the crop tool and just crop
out<00:02:04.330> those<00:02:04.600> edges<00:02:04.930> a<00:02:05.170> bit<00:02:05.409> so<00:02:05.619> you<00:02:05.710> can't<00:02:05.950> see

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:06.220 
out those edges a bit so you can't see

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:15.360 
out those edges a bit so you can't see
that<00:02:08.190> like<00:02:09.190> that<00:02:13.500> and<00:02:14.500> there's<00:02:14.770> our<00:02:15.069> final

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:15.370 
that like that and there's our final

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:18.449 
that like that and there's our final
image<00:02:15.880> has<00:02:16.540> a<00:02:16.569> sort<00:02:17.290> of<00:02:17.380> a<00:02:17.530> stippled<00:02:18.010> effect

00:02:18.449 --> 00:02:18.459 
image has a sort of a stippled effect

00:02:18.459 --> 00:02:20.640 
image has a sort of a stippled effect
that<00:02:18.730> you<00:02:18.940> would<00:02:19.060> see<00:02:19.300> maybe<00:02:20.230> in<00:02:20.500> an

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:20.650 
that you would see maybe in an

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:23.220 
that you would see maybe in an
impressionist<00:02:21.519> painting<00:02:22.000> I<00:02:22.180> hope<00:02:22.959> you<00:02:23.110> found

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:23.230 
impressionist painting I hope you found

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:27.030 
impressionist painting I hope you found
this<00:02:23.410> lesson<00:02:23.620> helpful<00:02:23.769> see<00:02:24.550> you<00:02:24.640> next<00:02:24.910> time
