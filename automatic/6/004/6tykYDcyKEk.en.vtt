00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:57.120 
flying based simulates swimming or just
a<00:00:54.100> hanging<00:00:55.030> anytime<00:00:55.990> somebody's<00:00:56.470> feet<00:00:56.800> leave

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:57.130 
a hanging anytime somebody's feet leave

00:00:57.130 --> 00:00:59.310 
a hanging anytime somebody's feet leave
the<00:00:57.160> ground<00:00:57.310> or<00:00:57.820> have<00:00:58.450> to<00:00:58.630> be<00:00:58.720> off<00:00:58.960> the<00:00:59.200> ground

00:00:59.310 --> 00:00:59.320 
the ground or have to be off the ground

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:02.160 
the ground or have to be off the ground
for<00:00:59.650> a<00:00:59.860> period<00:01:00.400> of<00:01:00.550> time<00:01:00.730> they<00:01:01.570> usually<00:01:01.930> call

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:02.170 
for a period of time they usually call

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:03.780 
for a period of time they usually call
me<00:01:02.380> and<00:01:02.530> say<00:01:02.739> look<00:01:03.220> this<00:01:03.370> is<00:01:03.550> what<00:01:03.670> we're

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:03.790 
me and say look this is what we're

00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:05.940 
me and say look this is what we're
trying<00:01:03.940> to<00:01:04.089> do<00:01:04.270> how<00:01:04.869> safe<00:01:05.140> can<00:01:05.170> we<00:01:05.440> do<00:01:05.560> it<00:01:05.710> I

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:05.950 
trying to do how safe can we do it I

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:09.450 
trying to do how safe can we do it I
think<00:01:06.430> flying<00:01:06.729> is<00:01:07.979> statistically<00:01:08.979> safer<00:01:09.190> than

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:09.460 
think flying is statistically safer than

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:12.630 
think flying is statistically safer than
dancing<00:01:09.820> on<00:01:09.970> stage<00:01:10.060> there<00:01:10.600> are<00:01:10.810> more<00:01:11.640> dancer

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:12.640 
dancing on stage there are more dancer

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:14.340 
dancing on stage there are more dancer
accidents<00:01:13.300> than<00:01:13.570> there<00:01:13.810> are<00:01:13.840> flying

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:14.350 
accidents than there are flying

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:16.050 
accidents than there are flying
accidents<00:01:15.009> so<00:01:15.310> these<00:01:15.430> are<00:01:15.580> the<00:01:15.610> fly<00:01:15.820> wires

00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:16.060 
accidents so these are the fly wires

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:18.060 
accidents so these are the fly wires
there<00:01:16.479> are<00:01:16.570> 3<00:01:17.050> 30<00:01:17.290> seconds<00:01:17.740> of<00:01:17.830> an<00:01:17.950> inch

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:18.070 
there are 3 30 seconds of an inch

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:20.190 
there are 3 30 seconds of an inch
they're<00:01:18.790> just<00:01:19.060> a<00:01:19.330> little<00:01:19.360> bit<00:01:19.690> thicker<00:01:19.899> than

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:20.200 
they're just a little bit thicker than

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:22.170 
they're just a little bit thicker than
then<00:01:20.590> pencil<00:01:21.070> lead<00:01:21.250> but<00:01:21.910> they're<00:01:22.030> a<00:01:22.060> lot

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:22.180 
then pencil lead but they're a lot

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:24.420 
then pencil lead but they're a lot
stronger<00:01:22.560> each<00:01:23.560> one<00:01:23.860> of<00:01:23.890> these<00:01:24.040> will<00:01:24.280> hold

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:24.430 
stronger each one of these will hold

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:28.890 
stronger each one of these will hold
roughly<00:01:25.950> roughly<00:01:26.950> a<00:01:27.100> thousand<00:01:27.549> pounds<00:01:27.909> this

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:28.900 
roughly roughly a thousand pounds this

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:31.380 
roughly roughly a thousand pounds this
is<00:01:29.020> the<00:01:29.140> harness<00:01:29.440> of<00:01:29.560> the<00:01:29.650> actors<00:01:30.010> wear<00:01:30.390> and

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:31.390 
is the harness of the actors wear and

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:32.880 
is the harness of the actors wear and
this<00:01:31.540> would<00:01:31.720> sit<00:01:31.990> right<00:01:32.170> on<00:01:32.200> their<00:01:32.470> hip<00:01:32.650> and

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:32.890 
this would sit right on their hip and

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:35.399 
this would sit right on their hip and
this<00:01:33.729> swivels<00:01:34.180> which<00:01:34.750> it<00:01:34.930> gives<00:01:35.140> them<00:01:35.290> the

00:01:35.399 --> 00:01:35.409 
this swivels which it gives them the

00:01:35.409 --> 00:01:37.680 
this swivels which it gives them the
ability<00:01:35.500> to<00:01:35.890> do<00:01:36.040> somersaults<00:01:36.700> or<00:01:37.330> they<00:01:37.510> can

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:37.690 
ability to do somersaults or they can

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:39.570 
ability to do somersaults or they can
lie<00:01:37.840> out<00:01:38.020> like<00:01:38.200> Superman<00:01:38.740> where<00:01:39.340> they<00:01:39.430> can

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:39.580 
lie out like Superman where they can

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:41.340 
lie out like Superman where they can
dive<00:01:39.790> down<00:01:40.119> and<00:01:40.450> create<00:01:40.780> all<00:01:41.020> of<00:01:41.080> these

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:41.350 
dive down and create all of these

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:44.219 
dive down and create all of these
amazing<00:01:41.740> body<00:01:42.520> positions<00:01:43.030> and<00:01:43.210> it's<00:01:43.900> a<00:01:43.960> real

00:01:44.219 --> 00:01:44.229 
amazing body positions and it's a real

00:01:44.229 --> 00:01:47.310 
amazing body positions and it's a real
easy<00:01:44.590> connection<00:01:45.220> this<00:01:46.090> is<00:01:46.240> the<00:01:46.330> piece<00:01:46.570> slides

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:47.320 
easy connection this is the piece slides

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:48.780 
easy connection this is the piece slides
right<00:01:47.530> into<00:01:47.710> the<00:01:47.860> harness<00:01:48.070> like<00:01:48.340> so<00:01:48.549> and

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:48.790 
right into the harness like so and

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:53.280 
right into the harness like so and
they're<00:01:49.690> hooked<00:01:49.869> up<00:01:50.020> I<00:01:51.060> started<00:01:52.060> doing<00:01:52.290> magic

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:53.290 
they're hooked up I started doing magic

00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:55.410 
they're hooked up I started doing magic
when<00:01:53.710> I<00:01:53.740> was<00:01:53.950> eight<00:01:54.159> years<00:01:54.310> old<00:01:54.549> and<00:01:54.939> I<00:01:55.299> was

00:01:55.410 --> 00:01:55.420 
when I was eight years old and I was

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:57.179 
when I was eight years old and I was
doing<00:01:55.780> professional<00:01:56.320> shows<00:01:56.560> by<00:01:56.860> the<00:01:56.950> time<00:01:57.159> I

00:01:57.179 --> 00:01:57.189 
doing professional shows by the time I

00:01:57.189 --> 00:01:59.940 
doing professional shows by the time I
was<00:01:57.369> 11<00:01:57.760> I<00:01:57.909> think<00:01:58.479> being<00:01:59.080> a<00:01:59.170> magician<00:01:59.350> and

00:01:59.940 --> 00:01:59.950 
was 11 I think being a magician and

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:03.600 
was 11 I think being a magician and
illusionist<00:02:00.960> helped<00:02:01.960> in<00:02:02.340> creating<00:02:03.340> flying

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:03.610 
illusionist helped in creating flying

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:07.380 
illusionist helped in creating flying
sequences<00:02:04.259> in<00:02:05.259> the<00:02:05.560> sense<00:02:05.799> that<00:02:06.060> you're<00:02:07.060> able

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:07.390 
sequences in the sense that you're able
