student<00:01:15.869> pricing<00:01:16.530> and<00:01:16.710> I<00:01:17.490> think<00:01:17.820> the<00:01:17.970> pricing

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
student pricing and I think the pricing

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:20.899 
student pricing and I think the pricing
on<00:01:18.570> it<00:01:18.689> let<00:01:18.810> me<00:01:18.869> just<00:01:19.080> check<00:01:19.350> I<00:01:19.650> never<00:01:20.009> I<00:01:20.670> never

the price up of the Thunderbolt Display
on<00:01:26.790> here<00:01:27.030> I<00:01:27.060> think<00:01:27.150> is<00:01:27.420> about<00:01:27.659> a<00:01:27.720> thousand

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650 
on here I think is about a thousand

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:32.539 
on here I think is about a thousand
pounds<00:01:28.979> oh<00:01:29.040> I<00:01:29.070> they<00:01:29.369> go<00:01:29.750> 899<00:01:30.750> pounds<00:01:31.530> so<00:01:32.369> that's

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549 
pounds oh I they go 899 pounds so that's

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:36.880 
pounds oh I they go 899 pounds so that's
a<00:01:32.670> big<00:01:33.290> big<00:01:34.290> investment<00:01:35.070> when<00:01:35.729> it<00:01:35.850> comes<00:01:36.090> to

you could say that premium price you'll

00:02:35.769 --> 00:02:38.160 
you could say that premium price you'll
get<00:02:35.920> in<00:02:36.010> a<00:02:36.099> lot<00:02:36.340> of<00:02:36.900> technology<00:02:37.900> and

there is one alternative which I would

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:50.460 
there is one alternative which I would
