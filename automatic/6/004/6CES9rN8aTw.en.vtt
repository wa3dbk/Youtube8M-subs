00:00:00.660 --> 00:00:06.640
 hello today day showed 

00:00:03.420 --> 00:00:08.460
 how to choose your good seeds for 

00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:11.080
 the garden's as far as the plantation 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:14.380
 so here I want to show I have some 

00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:16.269
 seeds are melon seeds that's 

00:00:14.380 --> 00:00:17.289
 valid my tip is valid on 

00:00:16.269 --> 00:00:19.960
 all the seeds 

00:00:17.289 --> 00:00:20.319
 there is a selection to make before the 

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:22.630
 plant 

00:00:20.319 --> 00:00:25.029
 it'll save you from sowing seeds 

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:26.890
 who have never ever me and lose the 

00:00:25.029 --> 00:00:30.909
 Norman time or have holes of 

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:32.830
 your vegetable garden at the little tip the 

00:00:30.909 --> 00:00:34.330
 here we have to choose its sheaths 

00:00:32.830 --> 00:00:36.070
 according to their size of their 

00:00:34.330 --> 00:00:38.440
 thickness and I give ourselves another 

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:40.690
 so be it is really it's 

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:44.230
 that they are good simply I the 

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:47.680
 pour and then on then in a first 

00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:49.450
 time just choose 

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:51.790
 already it is that they all have the same 

00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:53.560
 regular size but seeds that have 

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:55.690
 an irregular irrigated size you 

00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:57.490
 can already deleted this one by 

00:00:55.690 --> 00:00:57.910
 example in sailing is clearly more 

00:00:57.490 --> 00:01:00.070
 small 

00:00:57.910 --> 00:01:02.380
 moreover it is clearer than 

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:03.760
 others it is a little whitish by 

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:07.630
 report while the others are good 

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:10.659
 so I'm going to pull it off it will already be the 

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:13.420
 first selection the second is 

00:01:10.659 --> 00:01:19.049
 very simple just put them in 

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:19.049
 this jar and add water to it 

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:27.100
 it's all you little shots 

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:41.380
 and just look at it a little bit 

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:43.750
 is happening and right now you 

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:46.240
 see I do not know if we are willing to t 

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:48.179
 she to two others coming out come out 

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:53.259
 completely white 

00:01:48.179 --> 00:01:55.149
 we can see here clearly his side they 

00:01:53.259 --> 00:01:58.869
 are of a totally different color 

00:01:55.149 --> 00:02:02.890
 and we realize thanks to us that are 

00:01:58.869 --> 00:02:04.990
 completely hollow and so what makes 

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:07.240
 we know very well still in the running 

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:08.799
 mans with all the best fertilizers that 

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:09.280
 you want we would never arrive 

00:02:08.799 --> 00:02:11.830
 sprout 

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:16.299
 so it's just a matter of 

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:18.040
 remove these we also see 

00:02:16.299 --> 00:02:21.400
 that it is much more fun than 

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:25.030
 others have completely French and 

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:27.790
 when we look at it closely we 

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:30.549
 also realizes that the hollow that is 

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:32.049
 unfortunately you will not see mali 

00:02:30.549 --> 00:02:34.599
 completely hollow we see it very 

00:02:32.049 --> 00:02:36.160
 well the super fine and so these are the 

00:02:34.599 --> 00:02:40.230
 skins the others to are subscribed 

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:42.970
 biliary none flows so I can 

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:47.230
 take this leave my and I am 

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:49.470
 certain that we have almost 100% all 

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:51.549
 managed but that was the right trick 

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:54.040
 it works with all ghana - 

00:02:51.549 --> 00:02:55.959
 it was good but it is mostly done 

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:57.459
 was winning by lying and it's okay 

00:02:55.959 --> 00:02:57.850
 avoid having holes in your 

00:02:57.459 --> 00:03:01.350
 vegetable garden 

00:02:57.850 --> 00:03:01.350
 There it is, thanks
