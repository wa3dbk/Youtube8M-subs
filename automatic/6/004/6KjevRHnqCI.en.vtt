00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.150 

I<00:00:02.870> need<00:00:03.870> to<00:00:03.990> know<00:00:04.170> how<00:00:04.380> to<00:00:04.410> fix<00:00:04.799> a<00:00:04.980> dehumidifier

00:00:05.150 --> 00:00:05.160 
I need to know how to fix a dehumidifier

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:08.330 
I need to know how to fix a dehumidifier
that<00:00:05.970> freezes<00:00:06.390> up<00:00:06.569> if<00:00:07.350> the<00:00:07.649> refrigerant<00:00:08.130> is

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:08.340 
that freezes up if the refrigerant is

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:10.430 
that freezes up if the refrigerant is
leaking<00:00:08.370> out<00:00:08.910> it'll<00:00:09.210> freeze<00:00:09.780> up<00:00:10.019> to<00:00:10.139> the<00:00:10.230> point

00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:10.440 
leaking out it'll freeze up to the point

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:12.200 
leaking out it'll freeze up to the point
that<00:00:10.620> it<00:00:10.830> runs<00:00:11.070> out<00:00:11.280> of<00:00:11.340> the<00:00:11.610> chemicals<00:00:12.120> to

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:12.210 
that it runs out of the chemicals to

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:15.289 
that it runs out of the chemicals to
make<00:00:12.450> stuff<00:00:12.780> freeze<00:00:13.049> at<00:00:13.740> that<00:00:14.370> point<00:00:14.759> it<00:00:15.000> will

00:00:15.289 --> 00:00:15.299 
make stuff freeze at that point it will

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:17.930 
make stuff freeze at that point it will
fall<00:00:15.599> and<00:00:15.900> it<00:00:16.710> won't<00:00:16.920> work<00:00:17.130> as<00:00:17.369> a<00:00:17.400> dehumidifier

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:17.940 
fall and it won't work as a dehumidifier

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:21.170 
fall and it won't work as a dehumidifier
at<00:00:18.480> that<00:00:18.690> point<00:00:18.960> and<00:00:19.289> in<00:00:20.220> the<00:00:20.310> meantime<00:00:20.520> it

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:21.180 
at that point and in the meantime it

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:24.050 
at that point and in the meantime it
won't<00:00:21.539> work<00:00:21.720> as<00:00:21.930> well<00:00:22.160> you'll<00:00:23.160> also<00:00:23.400> get<00:00:23.760> a<00:00:23.820> lot

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:24.060 
won't work as well you'll also get a lot

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:26.210 
won't work as well you'll also get a lot
of<00:00:24.210> sweat<00:00:24.510> on<00:00:24.720> the<00:00:24.840> dehumidifier<00:00:25.560> building<00:00:26.070> up

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:26.220 
of sweat on the dehumidifier building up

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:28.189 
of sweat on the dehumidifier building up
faster<00:00:26.699> than<00:00:26.730> it<00:00:27.000> is<00:00:27.150> designed<00:00:27.630> to<00:00:27.869> collect

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:28.199

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:30.259 
faster than it is designed to collect
some<00:00:28.800> of<00:00:28.949> which<00:00:29.160> will<00:00:29.369> freeze<00:00:29.670> around<00:00:30.119> the

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:30.269 
some of which will freeze around the

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:33.080 
some of which will freeze around the
refrigerant<00:00:30.840> leak<00:00:31.099> what<00:00:32.099> do<00:00:32.279> I<00:00:32.309> do<00:00:32.579> about<00:00:32.730> it

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:33.090 
refrigerant leak what do I do about it

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:35.900 
refrigerant leak what do I do about it
having<00:00:33.360> ice<00:00:33.719> on<00:00:33.989> it<00:00:34.020> if<00:00:34.980> you<00:00:35.190> need<00:00:35.370> to<00:00:35.399> thaw<00:00:35.730> it

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:35.910 
having ice on it if you need to thaw it

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:39.260 
having ice on it if you need to thaw it
out<00:00:36.059> faster<00:00:36.630> turn<00:00:37.170> it<00:00:37.350> off<00:00:37.500> I<00:00:37.879> suppose<00:00:38.879> a<00:00:38.910> blow

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:39.270 
out faster turn it off I suppose a blow

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:42.080 
out faster turn it off I suppose a blow
dryer<00:00:39.660> would<00:00:39.960> work<00:00:40.140> even<00:00:40.350> faster<00:00:40.739> I<00:00:41.190> thought

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090 
dryer would work even faster I thought

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:43.430 
dryer would work even faster I thought
there<00:00:42.300> was<00:00:42.450> something<00:00:42.719> I<00:00:43.050> could<00:00:43.260> do<00:00:43.410> to

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
there was something I could do to

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:46.279 
there was something I could do to
actually<00:00:44.070> fix<00:00:44.309> it<00:00:44.550> you<00:00:45.450> could<00:00:45.629> change<00:00:45.899> the<00:00:46.110> air

00:00:46.279 --> 00:00:46.289 
actually fix it you could change the air

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:48.170 
actually fix it you could change the air
filters<00:00:46.710> yourself<00:00:47.280> in<00:00:47.520> case<00:00:47.969> the

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180 
filters yourself in case the

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:50.569 
filters yourself in case the
dehumidifier<00:00:48.960> is<00:00:49.230> icing<00:00:49.739> up<00:00:49.890> because<00:00:50.190> of<00:00:50.340> poor

dehumidifier is icing up because of poor
air<00:00:50.850> flow<00:00:50.879> through<00:00:51.449> the<00:00:51.629> air<00:00:51.780> filters<00:00:52.350> I<00:00:52.559> can

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:53.489 
air flow through the air filters I can

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:55.520 
air flow through the air filters I can
see<00:00:53.760> how<00:00:53.969> clogged<00:00:54.360> filters<00:00:54.930> make<00:00:55.170> the<00:00:55.320> motor

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
see how clogged filters make the motor

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:57.560 
see how clogged filters make the motor
run<00:00:55.829> harder<00:00:56.160> to<00:00:56.280> get<00:00:56.460> the<00:00:56.579> same<00:00:56.850> output<00:00:57.090> but

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 
run harder to get the same output but

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:00.560 
run harder to get the same output but
not<00:00:58.050> how<00:00:58.260> that<00:00:58.469> causes<00:00:58.890> it<00:00:59.039> to<00:00:59.070> ice<00:00:59.340> up<00:00:59.670> the

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:00.570 
not how that causes it to ice up the

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:02.029 
not how that causes it to ice up the
lack<00:01:00.840> of<00:01:00.870> air<00:01:01.260> flow<00:01:01.289> around<00:01:01.680> the

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039 
lack of air flow around the

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:04.429 
lack of air flow around the
dehumidifiers<00:01:02.789> refrigerant<00:01:03.570> fill<00:01:03.750> coils<00:01:04.199> can

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:04.439 
dehumidifiers refrigerant fill coils can

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:06.620 
dehumidifiers refrigerant fill coils can
cause<00:01:04.680> the<00:01:04.949> cool<00:01:05.129> air<00:01:05.369> to<00:01:05.580> become<00:01:05.939> cold<00:01:06.240> enough

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:06.630 
cause the cool air to become cold enough

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:09.230 
cause the cool air to become cold enough
to<00:01:06.689> freeze<00:01:06.900> and<00:01:07.490> there's<00:01:08.490> not<00:01:08.729> enough<00:01:09.030> airflow

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240 
to freeze and there's not enough airflow

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:11.390 
to freeze and there's not enough airflow
passing<00:01:10.080> through<00:01:10.320> the<00:01:10.500> coils<00:01:10.890> to<00:01:10.979> melt<00:01:11.250> the

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
passing through the coils to melt the

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:14.899 
passing through the coils to melt the
ice<00:01:11.430> crystals<00:01:12.180> so<00:01:12.689> you<00:01:12.750> get<00:01:13.080> a<00:01:13.110> frozen<00:01:13.439> coil<00:01:13.909> so

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:14.909 
ice crystals so you get a frozen coil so

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:16.700 
ice crystals so you get a frozen coil so
changing<00:01:15.360> the<00:01:15.509> air<00:01:15.659> filter<00:01:16.110> could<00:01:16.320> fix<00:01:16.530> the

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
changing the air filter could fix the

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:18.910 
changing the air filter could fix the
airflow<00:01:17.189> problem<00:01:17.700> that<00:01:17.880> causes<00:01:18.150> it<00:01:18.479> to<00:01:18.509> freeze

00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:18.920 
airflow problem that causes it to freeze

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:22.130 
airflow problem that causes it to freeze
it<00:01:19.920> won't<00:01:20.250> fix<00:01:20.490> a<00:01:20.670> refrigerant<00:01:21.180> leak<00:01:21.270> but<00:01:21.990> it

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
it won't fix a refrigerant leak but it

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:24.080 
it won't fix a refrigerant leak but it
could<00:01:22.380> solve<00:01:22.680> freezing<00:01:23.189> due<00:01:23.369> to<00:01:23.520> other<00:01:23.700> things

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
could solve freezing due to other things

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:26.840 
could solve freezing due to other things
I<00:01:24.330> probably<00:01:25.290> need<00:01:25.710> to<00:01:25.740> wash<00:01:26.100> them<00:01:26.340> with<00:01:26.549> bleach

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
I probably need to wash them with bleach

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:28.999 
I probably need to wash them with bleach
water<00:01:27.150> anyway<00:01:27.689> to<00:01:27.750> minimize<00:01:28.350> the<00:01:28.590> mold<00:01:28.799> and

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:29.009 
water anyway to minimize the mold and

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:30.760 
water anyway to minimize the mold and
mildew<00:01:29.070> growth<00:01:29.400> it<00:01:29.790> could<00:01:30.000> have<00:01:30.180> and<00:01:30.659> then

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:30.770 
mildew growth it could have and then

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:33.260 
mildew growth it could have and then
there's<00:01:31.770> the<00:01:31.920> possibility<00:01:32.579> that<00:01:32.610> your<00:01:33.030> cold

there's the possibility that your cold

HVAC repair people have that license you

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:53.990 
HVAC repair people have that license you
probably<00:01:52.200> do<00:01:52.470> not<00:01:52.619> have<00:01:52.680> the<00:01:53.040> tools<00:01:53.280> to<00:01:53.610> fix<00:01:53.820> a

that's<00:01:59.219> what<00:01:59.549> an<00:01:59.670> HVAC<00:02:00.360> repair<00:02:00.899> person<00:02:01.380> is<00:02:01.560> for

00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:01.829 
that's what an HVAC repair person is for

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:04.399 
that's what an HVAC repair person is for
many<00:02:02.790> of<00:02:02.969> them<00:02:03.210> won't<00:02:03.479> touch<00:02:03.810> a<00:02:03.869> dehumidifier

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:04.409 
many of them won't touch a dehumidifier

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:06.889 
many of them won't touch a dehumidifier
so<00:02:05.310> you<00:02:05.369> have<00:02:05.670> to<00:02:05.820> take<00:02:06.000> it<00:02:06.149> to<00:02:06.180> an<00:02:06.420> authorized

could<00:02:10.860> simply<00:02:11.250> solve<00:02:11.580> the<00:02:11.760> problem<00:02:12.120> by

00:02:12.229 --> 00:02:12.239 
could simply solve the problem by
