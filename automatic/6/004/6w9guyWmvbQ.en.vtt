hi<00:00:10.110> this<00:00:10.170> is<00:00:10.380> rachel<00:00:10.889> from<00:00:10.920> full<00:00:11.219> swing<00:00:11.400> tennis

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:11.790 
hi this is rachel from full swing tennis

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:13.549 
hi this is rachel from full swing tennis
today<00:00:12.480> we're<00:00:12.660> going<00:00:12.809> to<00:00:12.870> go<00:00:13.080> through

00:00:13.549 --> 00:00:13.559 
today we're going to go through

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:16.580 
today we're going to go through
pronation<00:00:14.340> so<00:00:15.269> pronation<00:00:15.900> is<00:00:16.170> basically

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:16.590 
pronation so pronation is basically

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:18.890 
pronation so pronation is basically
where<00:00:16.859> we<00:00:17.039> rotate<00:00:17.640> our<00:00:17.760> palm<00:00:17.970> outward<00:00:18.630> when<00:00:18.779> we

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:18.900 
where we rotate our palm outward when we

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:22.040 
where we rotate our palm outward when we
hit<00:00:19.050> the<00:00:19.230> serve<00:00:19.470> and<00:00:19.890> it<00:00:20.550> allows<00:00:20.820> us<00:00:20.850> to<00:00:21.090> get

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:22.050 
hit the serve and it allows us to get

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:24.590 
hit the serve and it allows us to get
really<00:00:22.590> fast<00:00:22.920> racket<00:00:23.430> speed<00:00:23.640> right<00:00:24.150> before<00:00:24.480> we

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:24.600 
really fast racket speed right before we

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:28.730 
really fast racket speed right before we
contact<00:00:25.019> the<00:00:25.140> ball<00:00:25.400> so<00:00:26.400> if<00:00:26.670> you<00:00:26.820> don't<00:00:27.740> pronate

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:28.740 
contact the ball so if you don't pronate

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:30.500 
contact the ball so if you don't pronate
what<00:00:29.189> will<00:00:29.310> happen<00:00:29.609> is<00:00:29.760> the<00:00:30.000> racket<00:00:30.300> speed

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:30.510 
what will happen is the racket speed

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:34.130 
what will happen is the racket speed
will<00:00:31.439> be<00:00:31.800> at<00:00:32.040> its<00:00:32.070> maximum<00:00:32.399> speed<00:00:33.140> after

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:34.140 
will be at its maximum speed after

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:35.810 
will be at its maximum speed after
you've<00:00:34.260> contacted<00:00:34.559> the<00:00:34.800> ball<00:00:34.980> so<00:00:35.370> it<00:00:35.489> has<00:00:35.640> no

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:35.820 
you've contacted the ball so it has no

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:38.569 
you've contacted the ball so it has no
bearing<00:00:36.270> on<00:00:36.360> how<00:00:36.540> hard<00:00:36.750> you<00:00:36.840> hit<00:00:37.020> the<00:00:37.170> surf<00:00:37.579> so

00:00:38.569 --> 00:00:38.579 
bearing on how hard you hit the surf so

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:39.950 
bearing on how hard you hit the surf so
one<00:00:38.790> of<00:00:38.850> the<00:00:38.940> most<00:00:39.090> important<00:00:39.540> things<00:00:39.660> with

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:39.960 
one of the most important things with

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:42.229 
one of the most important things with
pronation<00:00:40.590> is<00:00:40.950> using<00:00:41.520> a<00:00:41.579> continental<00:00:42.210> grip

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:42.239 
pronation is using a continental grip

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:44.990 
pronation is using a continental grip
which<00:00:42.870> is<00:00:43.050> that<00:00:43.290> index<00:00:43.770> knuckle<00:00:44.219> on<00:00:44.399> that<00:00:44.730> top

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:45.000 
which is that index knuckle on that top

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.979 
which is that index knuckle on that top
corner<00:00:45.300> bevel<00:00:45.890> so<00:00:46.890> one<00:00:47.309> of<00:00:47.370> the<00:00:47.430> ways<00:00:47.550> that<00:00:47.579> we

00:00:47.979 --> 00:00:47.989 
corner bevel so one of the ways that we

00:00:47.989 --> 00:00:50.479 
corner bevel so one of the ways that we
introduce<00:00:48.989> pronation<00:00:49.440> to<00:00:49.800> the<00:00:50.039> smaller

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
introduce pronation to the smaller

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:52.430 
introduce pronation to the smaller
beginner<00:00:51.210> children<00:00:51.690> we<00:00:51.840> just<00:00:51.989> have<00:00:52.110> them<00:00:52.260> get

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
beginner children we just have them get

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:54.590 
beginner children we just have them get
the<00:00:52.530> continental<00:00:53.100> grip<00:00:53.280> and<00:00:53.600> practice

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 
the continental grip and practice

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:59.229 
the continental grip and practice
bouncing<00:00:55.079> the<00:00:55.170> ball<00:00:55.379> and<00:00:55.649> this<00:00:56.340> has<00:00:57.530> the<00:00:58.530> hand

00:00:59.229 --> 00:00:59.239 
bouncing the ball and this has the hand

00:00:59.239 --> 00:01:03.410 
bouncing the ball and this has the hand
start<00:01:00.239> to<00:01:00.449> pronate<00:01:00.870> naturally<00:01:01.760> and<00:01:02.760> then<00:01:03.239> once

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
start to pronate naturally and then once

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:06.050 
start to pronate naturally and then once
i<00:01:03.510> practice<00:01:03.899> that<00:01:04.140> a<00:01:04.379> few<00:01:04.409> times<00:01:04.949> the<00:01:05.820> next

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
i practice that a few times the next

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:07.700 
i practice that a few times the next
progression<00:01:06.210> would<00:01:06.689> be<00:01:06.900> to<00:01:07.080> do<00:01:07.260> what<00:01:07.439> we<00:01:07.530> call

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
progression would be to do what we call

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:09.830 
progression would be to do what we call
the<00:01:07.890> buck<00:01:08.130> two<00:01:08.340> ball<00:01:08.580> cap<00:01:08.820> drill<00:01:09.090> so<00:01:09.570> what<00:01:09.750> we

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
the buck two ball cap drill so what we

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:12.280 
the buck two ball cap drill so what we
have<00:01:10.020> is<00:01:10.260> the<00:01:10.920> student<00:01:11.340> just<00:01:11.430> practice

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:12.290 
have is the student just practice

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:15.649 
have is the student just practice
pronating<00:01:13.290> and<00:01:13.580> supinating<00:01:14.580> so<00:01:14.880> supination

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:15.659 
pronating and supinating so supination

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:20.330 
pronating and supinating so supination
pronation<00:01:16.400> supination<00:01:17.400> pronation<00:01:18.030> and<00:01:19.340> then

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
pronation supination pronation and then

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:21.560 
pronation supination pronation and then
we're<00:01:20.520> going<00:01:20.640> to<00:01:20.700> do<00:01:20.759> is<00:01:20.820> introduce<00:01:20.939> the<00:01:21.330> ball

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
we're going to do is introduce the ball

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:24.140 
we're going to do is introduce the ball
where<00:01:21.780> they<00:01:21.900> bounce<00:01:22.200> it<00:01:22.470> and<00:01:22.500> then<00:01:22.770> have<00:01:23.220> the

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150 
where they bounce it and then have the

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:26.240 
where they bounce it and then have the
ball<00:01:24.360> bounced<00:01:24.630> up<00:01:24.810> and<00:01:24.900> hit<00:01:24.990> the<00:01:25.200> butt<00:01:25.409> cap<00:01:25.619> so

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
ball bounced up and hit the butt cap so

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:28.280 
ball bounced up and hit the butt cap so
the<00:01:26.280> next<00:01:26.880> progression<00:01:27.090> of<00:01:27.630> the<00:01:27.750> ball<00:01:27.930> to<00:01:28.110> buck

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:28.290 
the next progression of the ball to buck

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:30.170 
the next progression of the ball to buck
cap<00:01:28.530> drill<00:01:28.799> is<00:01:28.979> actually<00:01:29.520> how<00:01:29.670> the<00:01:29.729> student

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180 
cap drill is actually how the student

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:32.899 
cap drill is actually how the student
hit<00:01:30.390> some<00:01:30.600> balls<00:01:30.750> and<00:01:30.960> pronate<00:01:31.890> and<00:01:32.040> in<00:01:32.640> doing

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:32.909 
hit some balls and pronate and in doing

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:35.240 
hit some balls and pronate and in doing
that<00:01:33.060> they'll<00:01:33.720> finish<00:01:34.259> with<00:01:34.680> the<00:01:34.829> butt<00:01:35.040> cap

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
that they'll finish with the butt cap

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:38.240 
that they'll finish with the butt cap
pointing<00:01:35.909> to<00:01:36.030> the<00:01:36.119> sky<00:01:36.450> and<00:01:36.869> also<00:01:37.680> encourage

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 
pointing to the sky and also encourage

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:40.999 
pointing to the sky and also encourage
them<00:01:38.430> to<00:01:38.490> stop<00:01:39.000> the<00:01:39.630> swing<00:01:39.900> before<00:01:40.530> they<00:01:40.799> hit

00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:41.009 
them to stop the swing before they hit

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:42.920 
them to stop the swing before they hit
the<00:01:41.070> net<00:01:41.430> so<00:01:41.850> usually<00:01:42.270> do<00:01:42.390> this<00:01:42.479> on<00:01:42.600> a<00:01:42.630> point

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:42.930 
the net so usually do this on a point

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:44.929 
the net so usually do this on a point
system<00:01:43.110> so<00:01:43.500> they<00:01:43.649> get<00:01:43.770> one<00:01:44.009> point<00:01:44.310> if<00:01:44.759> they

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:44.939 
system so they get one point if they

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:46.460 
system so they get one point if they
finish<00:01:45.299> with<00:01:45.420> the<00:01:45.570> butt<00:01:45.720> cap<00:01:45.930> pointing<00:01:46.290> to<00:01:46.380> the

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:46.470 
finish with the butt cap pointing to the

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:50.240 
finish with the butt cap pointing to the
sky<00:01:46.740> and<00:01:47.070> a<00:01:47.909> second<00:01:48.299> point<00:01:48.509> if<00:01:48.750> they<00:01:49.220> manage<00:01:50.220> to

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250 
sky and a second point if they manage to

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:53.539 
sky and a second point if they manage to
not<00:01:50.729> hit<00:01:51.030> the<00:01:51.479> net<00:01:51.750> on<00:01:52.020> the<00:01:52.799> follow-through<00:01:53.340> so

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:53.549 
not hit the net on the follow-through so

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:55.789 
not hit the net on the follow-through so
when<00:01:54.149> I<00:01:54.180> do<00:01:54.270> this<00:01:54.479> I<00:01:54.689> like<00:01:54.750> to<00:01:55.049> have<00:01:55.229> them<00:01:55.439> come

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:55.799 
when I do this I like to have them come

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:58.580 
when I do this I like to have them come
right<00:01:56.729> up<00:01:56.880> close<00:01:57.030> to<00:01:57.149> the<00:01:57.390> net<00:01:57.570> and<00:01:57.840> we're

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:58.590 
right up close to the net and we're

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:00.620 
right up close to the net and we're
having<00:01:59.040> them<00:01:59.159> just<00:01:59.280> hit<00:01:59.549> half<00:01:59.909> serve<00:02:00.270> so<00:02:00.509> the

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:00.630 
having them just hit half serve so the

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:03.109 
having them just hit half serve so the
racket<00:02:01.079> head<00:02:01.290> is<00:02:01.500> pointing<00:02:01.770> to<00:02:01.860> the<00:02:01.950> sky<00:02:02.250> and<00:02:02.640> I

00:02:03.109 --> 00:02:03.119 
racket head is pointing to the sky and I

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:05.030 
racket head is pointing to the sky and I
also<00:02:03.270> like<00:02:03.479> to<00:02:03.509> have<00:02:03.750> them<00:02:04.079> pretend<00:02:04.829> as<00:02:05.009> though

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:05.040 
also like to have them pretend as though

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:07.100 
also like to have them pretend as though
they<00:02:05.340> are<00:02:05.369> throwing<00:02:05.790> the<00:02:05.969> ball<00:02:06.149> toss<00:02:06.360> up<00:02:06.570> so

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:07.110 
they are throwing the ball toss up so

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:09.050 
they are throwing the ball toss up so
they<00:02:07.229> can<00:02:07.469> get<00:02:07.649> the<00:02:07.799> right<00:02:07.979> shoulder<00:02:08.429> tilt<00:02:08.819> as

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:09.060 
they can get the right shoulder tilt as

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:11.330 
they can get the right shoulder tilt as
we're<00:02:09.720> doing<00:02:09.840> this<00:02:10.110> kam<00:02:10.440> finishes<00:02:11.160> with<00:02:11.310> the

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:11.340 
we're doing this kam finishes with the

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:13.370 
we're doing this kam finishes with the
butt<00:02:11.550> cap<00:02:11.730> pointing<00:02:12.060> to<00:02:12.150> the<00:02:12.270> sky

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:13.380 
butt cap pointing to the sky

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:15.560 
butt cap pointing to the sky
and<00:02:13.500> he<00:02:13.830> stops<00:02:14.130> before<00:02:14.490> he<00:02:14.550> hits<00:02:14.730> the<00:02:14.820> net<00:02:15.060> and

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:15.570 
and he stops before he hits the net and

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:21.260 
and he stops before he hits the net and
so<00:02:15.720> just<00:02:15.930> practicing<00:02:17.540> pronation<00:02:18.540> as<00:02:20.270> half

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:21.270 
so just practicing pronation as half

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:26.120 
so just practicing pronation as half
serves<00:02:21.660> and<00:02:23.870> after<00:02:24.870> I've<00:02:24.990> done<00:02:25.230> a<00:02:25.560> few<00:02:26.010> of

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:26.130 
serves and after I've done a few of

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:30.620 
serves and after I've done a few of
these<00:02:27.020> will<00:02:28.020> have<00:02:28.200> camp<00:02:29.120> throw<00:02:30.120> the<00:02:30.270> ball<00:02:30.450> up

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:30.630 
these will have camp throw the ball up

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:44.470 
these will have camp throw the ball up
himself<00:02:31.050> and<00:02:39.140> after<00:02:40.140> doing<00:02:40.410> a<00:02:42.590> few<00:02:43.590> of<00:02:43.980> those

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:44.480 
himself and after doing a few of those

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:47.660 
himself and after doing a few of those
and<00:02:45.480> we<00:02:45.630> start<00:02:45.930> to<00:02:46.110> move<00:02:46.290> them<00:02:46.530> back<00:02:46.740> to<00:02:47.580> the

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:47.670 
and we start to move them back to the

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:50.260 
and we start to move them back to the
service<00:02:48.060> line<00:02:48.150> and<00:02:48.630> then<00:02:48.780> to<00:02:48.990> the<00:02:49.110> base<00:02:49.320> line

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:50.270 
service line and then to the base line

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:53.510 
service line and then to the base line
so<00:02:51.270> another<00:02:51.540> really<00:02:51.840> great<00:02:52.080> way<00:02:52.170> to<00:02:52.320> have<00:02:52.620> the

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:53.520 
so another really great way to have the

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:56.270 
so another really great way to have the
student<00:02:53.880> practice<00:02:54.090> pronation<00:02:54.810> is<00:02:55.280> also

00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:56.280 
student practice pronation is also

00:02:56.280 --> 00:03:03.920 
student practice pronation is also
hitting<00:02:56.610> up<00:02:56.730> against<00:02:57.120> the<00:02:57.210> fence<00:03:02.720> using<00:03:03.720> half

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:03.930 
hitting up against the fence using half

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:07.850 
hitting up against the fence using half
serves<00:03:04.320> I'll<00:03:04.890> have<00:03:05.010> Kim<00:03:05.280> just<00:03:06.210> hit<00:03:07.080> a<00:03:07.350> hundred

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:07.860 
serves I'll have Kim just hit a hundred

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:11.060 
serves I'll have Kim just hit a hundred
balls<00:03:08.280> up<00:03:09.120> against<00:03:09.540> the<00:03:09.810> fence<00:03:10.590> and<00:03:10.830> just

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:11.070 
balls up against the fence and just

00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:22.490 
balls up against the fence and just
practicing<00:03:11.790> that<00:03:11.940> pronation<00:03:12.420> I<00:03:21.500> really

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:22.500 
practicing that pronation I really

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:23.960 
practicing that pronation I really
encourage<00:03:22.800> people<00:03:22.950> to<00:03:23.130> practice<00:03:23.310> against<00:03:23.790> the

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:23.970 
encourage people to practice against the

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:26.390 
encourage people to practice against the
fence<00:03:24.180> because<00:03:24.990> you<00:03:25.230> can't<00:03:25.470> see<00:03:25.710> if<00:03:25.980> the<00:03:26.190> ball

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:26.400 
fence because you can't see if the ball

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:28.310 
fence because you can't see if the ball
lands<00:03:26.640> in<00:03:26.790> the<00:03:26.880> service<00:03:27.210> box<00:03:27.480> so<00:03:28.020> it's<00:03:28.200> not

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:28.320 
lands in the service box so it's not

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:30.440 
lands in the service box so it's not
about<00:03:28.470> the<00:03:28.620> result<00:03:29.130> of<00:03:29.430> where<00:03:29.790> the<00:03:29.970> ball<00:03:30.150> goes

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:30.450 
about the result of where the ball goes

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:32.720 
about the result of where the ball goes
it's<00:03:31.080> about<00:03:31.410> getting<00:03:31.800> the<00:03:31.950> racquet<00:03:32.400> up<00:03:32.550> and

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:32.730 
it's about getting the racquet up and

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:34.700 
it's about getting the racquet up and
finishing<00:03:33.720> with<00:03:33.840> the<00:03:33.930> butt<00:03:34.110> cap<00:03:34.290> pointing<00:03:34.620> to

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:34.710 
finishing with the butt cap pointing to

00:03:34.710 --> 00:03:46.490 
finishing with the butt cap pointing to
the<00:03:34.830> sky<00:03:44.510> so<00:03:45.510> I<00:03:45.540> recommend<00:03:45.870> starting<00:03:46.260> with

00:03:46.490 --> 00:03:46.500 
the sky so I recommend starting with

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:48.770 
the sky so I recommend starting with
passes<00:03:47.490> so<00:03:47.790> the<00:03:47.880> racket<00:03:48.240> is<00:03:48.300> pointing<00:03:48.330> to<00:03:48.660> the

00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:48.780 
passes so the racket is pointing to the

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:51.680 
passes so the racket is pointing to the
sky<00:03:49.110> and<00:03:49.610> finish<00:03:50.610> with<00:03:50.910> the<00:03:51.030> bucket<00:03:51.390> pointing

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:51.690 
sky and finish with the bucket pointing

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:54.350 
sky and finish with the bucket pointing
to<00:03:52.290> the<00:03:52.410> sky<00:03:52.620> and<00:03:53.010> then<00:03:53.850> after<00:03:54.120> you've<00:03:54.209> done

00:03:54.350 --> 00:03:54.360 
to the sky and then after you've done

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:57.949 
to the sky and then after you've done
that<00:03:54.420> 20<00:03:55.170> 50<00:03:55.470> times<00:03:55.740> you<00:03:56.010> can<00:03:56.390> incorporate<00:03:57.390> the

00:03:57.949 --> 00:03:57.959 
that 20 50 times you can incorporate the

00:03:57.959 --> 00:04:02.540 
that 20 50 times you can incorporate the
form<00:03:58.340> tennis<00:03:59.340> swing<00:04:01.100> so<00:04:02.100> I<00:04:02.130> really<00:04:02.430> recommend

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:02.550 
form tennis swing so I really recommend

00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:05.030 
form tennis swing so I really recommend
that<00:04:02.940> you<00:04:03.030> try<00:04:03.780> and<00:04:03.810> learn<00:04:04.110> pronation<00:04:04.590> if<00:04:04.950> you

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:05.040 
that you try and learn pronation if you

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:07.790 
that you try and learn pronation if you
want<00:04:05.190> to<00:04:05.250> have<00:04:05.370> a<00:04:05.400> good<00:04:05.700> serve<00:04:06.030> is<00:04:06.390> it's<00:04:06.930> easier

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:07.800 
want to have a good serve is it's easier

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:11.360 
want to have a good serve is it's easier
to<00:04:08.160> hit<00:04:08.520> a<00:04:08.700> harder<00:04:09.390> serve<00:04:09.690> and<00:04:10.110> there's<00:04:11.070> less

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:11.370 
to hit a harder serve and there's less

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:13.160 
to hit a harder serve and there's less
wear<00:04:11.550> and<00:04:11.610> tear<00:04:11.880> on<00:04:11.970> your<00:04:12.090> shoulder<00:04:12.480> so<00:04:12.959> if<00:04:13.050> you
