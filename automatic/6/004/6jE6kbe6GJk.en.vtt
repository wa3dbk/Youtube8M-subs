Pentax q7 is a third-generation q' lens
system<00:00:16.410> from<00:00:16.650> pentek's

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:17.250 
system from pentek's

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:20.000 
system from pentek's
why<00:00:17.789> is<00:00:17.850> it<00:00:18.060> called<00:00:18.180> 7<00:00:18.660> my<00:00:18.869> guess<00:00:19.199> is<00:00:19.529> that<00:00:19.740> it's

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:20.010 
why is it called 7 my guess is that it's

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:23.029 
why is it called 7 my guess is that it's
7<00:00:20.550> ounces<00:00:21.119> which<00:00:21.930> is<00:00:21.990> about<00:00:22.140> only<00:00:22.320> 200<00:00:22.830> grams

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:23.039 
7 ounces which is about only 200 grams

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:26.120 
7 ounces which is about only 200 grams
as<00:00:23.400> you<00:00:23.970> can<00:00:24.090> see<00:00:24.269> here<00:00:24.539> I<00:00:24.570> have<00:00:24.720> the<00:00:25.230> model

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:26.130 
as you can see here I have the model

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:27.710 
as you can see here I have the model
with<00:00:26.310> the<00:00:26.340> standard<00:00:26.910> kit<00:00:27.119> lens<00:00:27.359> that<00:00:27.660> goes

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:27.720 
with the standard kit lens that goes

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:30.589 
with the standard kit lens that goes
from<00:00:28.170> 5<00:00:28.560> to<00:00:29.010> 15<00:00:29.460> millimeter<00:00:29.939> because<00:00:30.480> the

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:30.599 
from 5 to 15 millimeter because the

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:33.830 
from 5 to 15 millimeter because the
sensor<00:00:31.019> is<00:00:31.170> only<00:00:31.349> one<00:00:31.769> one<00:00:32.250> point<00:00:32.940> seventh<00:00:33.630> of

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:33.840 
sensor is only one one point seventh of

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:37.220 
sensor is only one one point seventh of
an<00:00:34.050> inch<00:00:34.230> the<00:00:34.860> multiplier<00:00:35.579> rate<00:00:35.969> for<00:00:36.480> the

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:37.230 
an inch the multiplier rate for the

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:38.810 
an inch the multiplier rate for the
millimeter<00:00:37.680> account<00:00:38.100> is<00:00:38.340> actually<00:00:38.520> about

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:38.820 
millimeter account is actually about

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:41.090 
millimeter account is actually about
four<00:00:39.059> point<00:00:39.329> seven<00:00:39.719> so<00:00:40.379> this<00:00:40.530> is<00:00:40.680> above<00:00:40.980> the

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:41.100 
four point seven so this is above the

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:44.060 
four point seven so this is above the
equivalent<00:00:41.550> of<00:00:41.730> a<00:00:42.030> regular<00:00:42.719> lens<00:00:42.930> kit<00:00:43.230> that

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.070 
equivalent of a regular lens kit that

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:46.790 
equivalent of a regular lens kit that
you<00:00:44.100> will<00:00:44.370> get<00:00:44.579> a<00:00:44.610> DSLR<00:00:45.420> or<00:00:46.140> other<00:00:46.289> mirrorless

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
you will get a DSLR or other mirrorless

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:49.459 
you will get a DSLR or other mirrorless
system<00:00:47.120> so<00:00:48.120> what<00:00:48.360> really<00:00:48.570> sets<00:00:48.960> this<00:00:49.140> system

00:00:49.459 --> 00:00:49.469 
system so what really sets this system

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:52.279 
system so what really sets this system
apart<00:00:49.800> is<00:00:50.039> this<00:00:50.219> tiny<00:00:50.610> tiny<00:00:51.000> foam<00:00:51.329> factor<00:00:51.690> and

00:00:52.279 --> 00:00:52.289 
apart is this tiny tiny foam factor and

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:53.990 
apart is this tiny tiny foam factor and
as<00:00:52.410> I<00:00:52.500> mentioned<00:00:52.770> before<00:00:52.829> it's<00:00:53.190> only<00:00:53.280> seven

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 
as I mentioned before it's only seven

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.450 
as I mentioned before it's only seven
ounces<00:00:54.719> and<00:00:55.020> you<00:00:55.199> get<00:00:55.410> a<00:00:55.460> backside

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
ounces and you get a backside

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:59.689 
ounces and you get a backside
illuminated<00:00:57.000> CMOS<00:00:57.539> sensor<00:00:57.960> that's<00:00:58.770> only<00:00:59.160> 12

00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699 
illuminated CMOS sensor that's only 12

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:02.840 
illuminated CMOS sensor that's only 12
megapixel<00:01:00.390> but<00:01:00.930> it's<00:01:01.800> very<00:01:02.250> good<00:01:02.640> in

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
megapixel but it's very good in

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:06.350 
megapixel but it's very good in
low-light<00:01:03.949> for<00:01:04.949> the<00:01:05.070> price<00:01:05.339> range<00:01:05.729> because

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
low-light for the price range because

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:08.870 
low-light for the price range because
it's<00:01:06.630> got<00:01:06.869> built-in<00:01:07.500> image<00:01:07.740> stabilization<00:01:08.010> on

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
it's got built-in image stabilization on

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:11.090 
it's got built-in image stabilization on
the<00:01:09.420> sensor<00:01:09.780> itself<00:01:10.080> on<00:01:10.380> the<00:01:10.470> front<00:01:10.860> of<00:01:10.979> the

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100 
the sensor itself on the front of the

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:14.000 
the sensor itself on the front of the
camera<00:01:11.369> you'll<00:01:11.760> see<00:01:12.090> there<00:01:12.330> is<00:01:12.450> a<00:01:13.010> function

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
camera you'll see there is a function

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:15.830 
camera you'll see there is a function
dial<00:01:14.310> on<00:01:14.520> the<00:01:14.610> left<00:01:14.909> and<00:01:15.299> you<00:01:15.420> can<00:01:15.450> actually

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
dial on the left and you can actually

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:17.899 
dial on the left and you can actually
choose<00:01:16.320> your<00:01:16.470> own<00:01:16.590> setting<00:01:17.100> if<00:01:17.220> you<00:01:17.340> like<00:01:17.549> or

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909 
choose your own setting if you like or

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:21.230 
choose your own setting if you like or
the<00:01:17.939> default<00:01:18.450> or<00:01:19.400> image<00:01:20.400> filters<00:01:20.880> what<00:01:21.210> I

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
the default or image filters what I

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:22.969 
the default or image filters what I
really<00:01:21.540> like<00:01:21.750> about<00:01:21.780> this<00:01:22.140> camera<00:01:22.439> is<00:01:22.590> that<00:01:22.740> it

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
really like about this camera is that it

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:26.030 
really like about this camera is that it
shoots<00:01:23.280> raw<00:01:23.729> which<00:01:24.180> is<00:01:24.360> pretty<00:01:25.080> rare<00:01:25.470> for<00:01:25.500> a

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
shoots raw which is pretty rare for a

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:28.100 
shoots raw which is pretty rare for a
camera<00:01:26.369> of<00:01:26.460> this<00:01:26.580> size<00:01:26.790> and<00:01:27.150> with<00:01:27.240> JPEG<00:01:28.080> you

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
camera of this size and with JPEG you

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:30.289 
camera of this size and with JPEG you
catch<00:01:28.439> a<00:01:28.530> shoe<00:01:28.740> really<00:01:28.979> really<00:01:29.460> fast<00:01:29.820> burst

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
catch a shoe really really fast burst

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:32.240 
catch a shoe really really fast burst
modes<00:01:30.600> and<00:01:31.079> just<00:01:31.439> like<00:01:31.619> all<00:01:31.860> the<00:01:32.040> other

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250 
modes and just like all the other

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:34.640 
modes and just like all the other
cameras<00:01:32.700> out<00:01:32.850> there<00:01:32.880> it<00:01:33.329> takes<00:01:33.570> SD<00:01:33.930> card<00:01:34.439> and

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:34.650 
cameras out there it takes SD card and

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:37.219 
cameras out there it takes SD card and
also<00:01:34.890> actually<00:01:35.130> have<00:01:35.400> AI<00:01:35.670> fice<00:01:36.390> Wi-Fi<00:01:36.990> support

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229 
also actually have AI fice Wi-Fi support

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:40.490 
also actually have AI fice Wi-Fi support
built-in<00:01:38.189> so<00:01:38.790> this<00:01:39.090> thing<00:01:39.540> could<00:01:39.900> potentially

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
built-in so this thing could potentially

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:42.080 
built-in so this thing could potentially
have<00:01:40.650> Wi-Fi<00:01:41.040> now<00:01:41.610> the<00:01:41.670> only<00:01:41.850> thing<00:01:42.060> that's

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
have Wi-Fi now the only thing that's

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:44.480 
have Wi-Fi now the only thing that's
missing<00:01:42.450> in<00:01:42.990> this<00:01:43.560> camera<00:01:43.860> that<00:01:44.130> could<00:01:44.310> think

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 
missing in this camera that could think

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:47.660 
missing in this camera that could think
of<00:01:44.670> is<00:01:45.229> GPS<00:01:46.229> so<00:01:46.740> if<00:01:46.979> that's<00:01:47.220> something<00:01:47.520> that

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
of is GPS so if that's something that

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:50.030 
of is GPS so if that's something that
you<00:01:47.759> really<00:01:47.790> need<00:01:48.259> this<00:01:49.259> is<00:01:49.409> not<00:01:49.590> the<00:01:49.770> camera

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:50.040 
you really need this is not the camera

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:52.010 
you really need this is not the camera
for<00:01:50.220> you<00:01:50.369> I<00:01:50.549> really<00:01:51.210> wouldn't<00:01:51.390> compare<00:01:51.810> this

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020 
for you I really wouldn't compare this

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:55.609 
for you I really wouldn't compare this
to<00:01:52.320> a<00:01:52.350> heightened<00:01:53.210> DSLR<00:01:54.210> this<00:01:54.600> is<00:01:54.750> more<00:01:55.170> of<00:01:55.350> a

00:01:55.609 --> 00:01:55.619 
to a heightened DSLR this is more of a

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:59.359 
to a heightened DSLR this is more of a
high-end<00:01:56.780> point-and-shoot<00:01:57.920> but<00:01:58.920> you<00:01:59.159> have

00:01:59.359 --> 00:01:59.369 
high-end point-and-shoot but you have

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:02.630 
high-end point-and-shoot but you have
the<00:01:59.729> flexibility<00:02:00.329> of<00:02:00.829> changing<00:02:01.829> the<00:02:02.159> lens<00:02:02.340> if

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:02.640 
the flexibility of changing the lens if

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:05.600
