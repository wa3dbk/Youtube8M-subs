something<00:00:18.270> now<00:00:18.720> I<00:00:19.380> really<00:00:20.220> like<00:00:20.400> spider-man

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:21.210 
something now I really like spider-man

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:25.670 
something now I really like spider-man
because<00:00:21.480> he's<00:00:21.869> my<00:00:22.769> type<00:00:23.400> of<00:00:24.350> superhero<00:00:25.350> in

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:25.680 
because he's my type of superhero in

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:30.859 
because he's my type of superhero in
Marvel<00:00:26.430> so<00:00:27.230> I<00:00:28.230> think<00:00:28.830> that's<00:00:29.250> it<00:00:29.689> there's<00:00:30.689> no

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:30.869 
Marvel so I think that's it there's no

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:38.330 
Marvel so I think that's it there's no
comment<00:00:31.349> about<00:00:31.669> Sandman<00:00:32.669> now<00:00:34.940> I<00:00:37.340> give

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:39.530 
comment about Sandman now I give
spider-man

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:39.540 
spider-man

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:46.330 
spider-man
five<00:00:40.320> or<00:00:40.500> five<00:00:41.809> he's<00:00:42.809> perfect<00:00:43.739> nothing

00:00:46.330 --> 00:00:46.340 
five or five he's perfect nothing

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:53.950 
five or five he's perfect nothing
nothing<00:00:48.050> nothing<00:00:51.110> like<00:00:52.110> damage<00:00:52.829> or<00:00:53.100> something

00:00:53.950 --> 00:00:53.960 
nothing nothing like damage or something

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:56.840 
nothing nothing like damage or something
well<00:00:54.960> of<00:00:55.170> course<00:00:55.230> this<00:00:55.739> suit<00:00:56.190> or<00:00:56.399> something

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
well of course this suit or something

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:04.149 
well of course this suit or something
that<00:00:57.030> but<00:00:59.629> the<00:01:00.629> problem<00:01:01.109> is<00:01:01.289> I<00:01:01.710> can't<00:01:02.579> open<00:01:03.059> the

00:01:04.149 --> 00:01:04.159 
that but the problem is I can't open the

00:01:04.159 --> 00:01:11.690 
that but the problem is I can't open the
mask<00:01:05.390> that's<00:01:06.390> why<00:01:07.350> so<00:01:07.890> I<00:01:08.240> think<00:01:09.240> it's<00:01:10.580> hard<00:01:11.580> to

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
mask that's why so I think it's hard to

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:15.469 
mask that's why so I think it's hard to
open<00:01:11.880> if<00:01:12.510> you<00:01:12.659> have<00:01:12.990> this<00:01:13.260> or<00:01:13.950> some<00:01:14.790> of<00:01:14.939> you<00:01:15.119> or
