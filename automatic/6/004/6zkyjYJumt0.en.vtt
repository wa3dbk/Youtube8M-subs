00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:07.970
 his 

00:00:10.229 --> 00:00:13.829
 Hello in this video Markus pointed out that it also off if there is for him 

00:00:13.829 --> 00:00:16.199
 sometimes not really thinking 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:20.560
 you know for sure that is impressive the TR in this tournament part of the 

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:22.199
 Team something else 

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:23.689
 Anyway, they know 

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:26.429
 This is usually synonymous this week to a computer 

00:00:26.429 --> 00:00:30.319
 Windows can then, for example, this printer 

00:00:30.319 --> 00:00:33.609
 among other things for all other computers in the same network share 

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:38.080
 but when and if there is a solution because the corresponding computer always 

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:39.300
 Must be online 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:42.410
 that's not good enough for companies so far that's the reason why 

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:43.830
 called network printer 

00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:44.659
 printer 

00:00:44.659 --> 00:00:45.960
 like a computer 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:47.399
 are in the network 

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:51.359
 and print jobs are already available from the network 

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:55.970
 Of course, every printer manufacturer has to be on the Internet as well 

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:59.090
 equip the printer with a web interface 

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:02.800
 so then, for example, can be brought up to date on 

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:06.110
 the status of the printer so far so good 

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:11.540
 However, it seems that nobody in this company thought 

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:16.310
 above does that if someone from the LAN is on the printer's Stars Web Interface 

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:17.149
 can access 

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:19.880
 then somebody from the internet can do that too 

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:24.560
 so far, it is important to prohibit access from the Internet 

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:26.100
 which is obvious 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:27.990
 However, not everyone breathe 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:31.780
 so clever but it will then only turn the web interface 

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:34.230
 has a unique identifier 

00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:37.439
 and at the same time also Dr calculator 

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:39.609
 or we are super 

00:01:39.609 --> 00:01:42.930
 available on the internet so that he is next to Google 

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:44.790
 this one in the exiled one 

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:47.159
 including the recognizable string 

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:50.159
 but he would just look for it 

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:53.400
 Just go to Google 

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:56.909
 just type in URL colon HB 

00:01:56.909 --> 00:01:59.030
 / The choice is made 

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:00.250
 it is colorful 

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:03.490
 Elz i in Despair Chur 

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:06.920
 and it was just an example to mention if you have a network printer 

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:08.490
 they need to tell this man 

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:13.220
 and they see what identifier this printer has and then just look for it 

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:14.560
 what do you have it? 

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:16.519
 exemplary after 

00:02:16.519 --> 00:02:22.120
 Brucker Handful of hewlett-packard but now find here good 9600 is not 

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:23.179
 correctly 

00:02:23.179 --> 00:02:26.130
 what connoisseurs already be from the other video the Spring Neumann 

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:30.910
 So there are 70 printers that are definitely available on the internet for us 

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:34.389
 that's enough 

00:02:34.389 --> 00:02:38.149
 but that's enough because it will be particularly embarrassing if our printer there 

00:02:38.149 --> 00:02:41.289
 I am simply rewarded Â» 

00:02:41.289 --> 00:02:44.289
 just click on the corresponding link 

00:02:45.859 --> 00:02:48.469
 the connection is encrypted https 

00:02:48.469 --> 00:02:52.129
 there probably should not pretend any certainty 

00:02:52.129 --> 00:02:53.479
 really there 

00:02:53.479 --> 00:02:56.299
 Son and already are on the appropriate pressure or even in this 

00:02:56.299 --> 00:02:58.119
 Case a HB 

00:02:58.119 --> 00:02:59.999
 Corner reader Jet 

00:02:59.999 --> 00:03:03.709
 4000 700 euros can look at status 

00:03:07.759 --> 00:03:12.099
 So we see that, for example, the color of Ghent slowly but surely 

00:03:12.099 --> 00:03:13.849
 Tilts 

00:03:13.849 --> 00:03:15.829
 Configuration page 

00:03:15.829 --> 00:03:17.849
 Mussolini here 

00:03:17.849 --> 00:03:19.759
 how much memory 

00:03:19.759 --> 00:03:22.589
 is installed 

00:03:22.589 --> 00:03:25.589
 how many pages were printed 

00:03:28.479 --> 00:03:31.479
 he went to York 

00:03:33.619 --> 00:03:36.619
 when the printer skipped what paper 

00:03:38.429 --> 00:03:41.429
 you that late game 

00:03:42.149 --> 00:03:45.149
 so on their letters were 

00:03:47.379 --> 00:03:50.379
 7 60 thousand 500 pages printed 

00:03:51.809 --> 00:03:54.809
 Diagnostics b 

00:03:56.999 --> 00:03:59.189
 I think that I am particularly productive 

00:03:59.189 --> 00:04:02.199
 the white of people it might power struggle 

00:04:02.199 --> 00:04:04.109
 not useful either 

00:04:04.109 --> 00:04:08.709
 but from Volker 04 it started to make nonsense pull mode is switched on 

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:22.910
 Sleep mode turned on and you can now in all seriousness a file 

00:04:22.910 --> 00:04:24.120
 Upload 

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:27.120
 which is then printed 

00:04:28.189 --> 00:04:30.939
 of course I will not do that here now because we just open 

00:04:30.939 --> 00:04:34.340
 Point out security holes but never exploit them 

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:37.300
 that's what the well-endowed light obviously does 

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:40.110
 never made a bed of peasants because otherwise they would already have a catch 

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:41.020
 advanced 

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:45.120
 but it's amazing how people might believe theirs 

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:46.800
 Build networks 

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:50.159
 but if I was to send the 100 page document now with 100% 

00:04:50.159 --> 00:04:53.159
 some cartridges lost the cartridge is completely empty 

00:04:53.719 --> 00:04:57.679
 So check out if your printer is on the internet. It does not have to 

00:04:57.679 --> 00:04:58.150
 his 

00:04:58.150 --> 00:05:01.620
 even if they think they are on the Internet 

00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:06.550
 Printer access then there are much smaller approaches than in 

00:05:06.550 --> 00:05:08.939
 this 

00:05:08.939 --> 00:05:12.479
 should now be the one or the other spectators tried here nonsense 

00:05:12.479 --> 00:05:16.529
 so be forewarned that even if the admin here in this case 

00:05:16.529 --> 00:05:19.729
 has the intelligence of an average bratwurst 

00:05:19.729 --> 00:05:24.259
 so it would be possible that he checks the log-data after their attack and Udo 

00:05:24.259 --> 00:05:26.419
 Voigt her Eyed Peas victory 

00:05:26.419 --> 00:05:30.169
 that could then have very unpleasant side effects severe for them 

00:05:30.169 --> 00:05:33.289
 we have already penetrated the sign here in a foreign network 

00:05:42.449 --> 00:05:42.680
 his
