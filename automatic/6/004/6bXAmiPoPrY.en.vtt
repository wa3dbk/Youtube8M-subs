00:00:32.569 --> 00:00:32.579 
in the game boy version they were the

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:35.510 
in the game boy version they were the
first<00:00:32.610> levels<00:00:33.120> I<00:00:33.620> know<00:00:34.620> it's<00:00:34.920> a<00:00:34.980> shock<00:00:35.190> isn't

first levels I know it's a shock isn't
it<00:00:38.149> but<00:00:39.149> there<00:00:39.629> is<00:00:39.750> one<00:00:39.899> thing<00:00:39.960> to<00:00:40.170> note<00:00:40.350> this

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.070 
it but there is one thing to note this

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:43.580 
it but there is one thing to note this
version<00:00:41.430> is<00:00:41.489> considerably<00:00:42.030> harder<00:00:42.590> even

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:43.590 
version is considerably harder even

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:44.720 
version is considerably harder even
though<00:00:43.770> I<00:00:43.800> may<00:00:43.980> not<00:00:44.070> mean<00:00:44.280> anything<00:00:44.370> it<00:00:44.640> look

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730 
though I may not mean anything it look

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:47.720

that<00:00:44.879> way<00:00:45.590> also<00:00:46.590> the<00:00:46.770> Nintendo<00:00:47.129> version<00:00:47.309> skips

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.730 
that way also the Nintendo version skips

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:49.580 
that way also the Nintendo version skips
out<00:00:47.879> the<00:00:48.120> 50-meter<00:00:48.690> stage<00:00:48.989> and<00:00:49.200> I<00:00:49.230> really

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590 
out the 50-meter stage and I really

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:58.580 
out the 50-meter stage and I really
don't<00:00:49.860> know<00:00:49.920> why<00:00:50.280> I<00:00:56.030> think<00:00:57.030> it<00:00:57.149> was<00:00:57.590> memory

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:58.590 
don't know why I think it was memory

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:00.290 
don't know why I think it was memory
reasons<00:00:59.010> or<00:00:59.100> something<00:00:59.370> but<00:00:59.520> I<00:00:59.550> can't<00:00:59.640> really

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
reasons or something but I can't really

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:01.910 
reasons or something but I can't really
see<00:01:00.539> how<00:01:00.750> one<00:01:01.050> more<00:01:01.260> stage<00:01:01.559> would<00:01:01.770> have

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
see how one more stage would have

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:06.350 
see how one more stage would have
defected<00:01:02.309> at<00:01:02.399> that<00:01:02.579> much<00:01:04.880> also<00:01:05.880> important<00:01:06.270> to

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
defected at that much also important to

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:12.740 
defected at that much also important to
