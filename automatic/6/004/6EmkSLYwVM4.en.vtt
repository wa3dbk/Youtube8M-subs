00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:14.830
 value the beauty that is the most 

00:00:12.790 --> 00:00:16.540
 a more robust result for 

00:00:14.830 --> 00:00:20.410
 You already make this motherboard today. 

00:00:16.540 --> 00:00:23.410
 gigabyte model 81 h mh little sign of 

00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:26.289
 entry is by gigabyte which looks fine 

00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:28.510
 cool with your gay kit and you 

00:00:26.289 --> 00:00:31.960
 save a little on the motherboard invests 

00:00:28.510 --> 00:00:34.360
 on the processor and video card that is 

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:38.140
 what will give you that joy that the 

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:39.630
 fps up there so do a lot here 

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:42.730
 male with a stylus 

00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:46.180
 another good law that it gigabyte seal 

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:47.920
 to people talk about quality only 

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:49.899
 invented their own brand 

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:51.640
 So there's always this here, 

00:00:49.899 --> 00:00:54.910
 all have not all are good 

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:57.820
 they put is this seal to show 

00:00:54.910 --> 00:01:00.309
 that they are is that they have the 

00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:03.129
 requirements or some requirements 

00:01:00.309 --> 00:01:05.170
 their standards here until we can see 

00:01:03.129 --> 00:01:06.729
 is that the protection against moisture protection 

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:09.130
 against power failures 

00:01:06.729 --> 00:01:12.640
 the opposition counted temperatures 

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:16.720
 capacitors net one 

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:18.190
 greater durability of income over 

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:20.170
 I will not go into much detail 

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:22.509
 about this here we talk about the 

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:24.520
 technologies in the total of vulture 

00:01:22.509 --> 00:01:26.140
 The gigabyte really is pretty 

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:28.300
 nice here on the side 

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:30.670
 but about the brand here in the number of 

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:37.270
 series these little things but let it go 

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:40.660
 interested in are seeing that is well 

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:46.060
 simple is a doorway then no 

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:51.640
 has much rustling the m1to have explained to 

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:53.319
 You mean it's smaller size. 

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:57.840
 that the standard 

00:01:53.319 --> 00:02:01.060
 I find nothing manual fruit correct 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:03.190
 second discussion with the drivers né 

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:04.420
 the bar is not the old sticker that the 

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:07.119
 Guys like to stick a cabinet 

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:10.060
 inform the staff very much 

00:02:07.119 --> 00:02:13.810
 It's interesting to look at is in Portuguese 

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:15.700
 A current chaos is to continue. 

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:16.599
 the move and yielded 1 for example is sane 

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:18.270
 two cases 

00:02:16.599 --> 00:02:20.940
 we speak in room 3 

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:23.280
 and she's here with the motherboard mirror 

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:24.390
 we fit there in the back of the 

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:29.550
 cabinet 

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:31.440
 so I put it very well a little 

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:34.050
 site of a site with 64 default 

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:37.110
 any radio and have already realized this 

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:39.990
 Also then here is the 

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:43.400
 to perceive very dark gigabyte pattern 

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:45.450
 in that brown practically black pebble 

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:48.450
 personal page mark 

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:51.690
 So here the minutes at the side entrances 

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:55.830
 Sure, one black jumps two days. 

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:58.680
 white sata3 right two of each is é 

00:02:55.830 --> 00:03:02.130
 the day which is a lot in this 

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:04.110
 put the psd here can put post 

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:07.080
 to mount four chairs right 

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:10.380
 Anyway, school has room for 

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:13.010
 store many data memory two 

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:15.630
 spaces it supports up to 16 gigabytes 

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:17.430
 video card here you will put 

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:20.070
 in this first one right here and only neps 

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:22.680
 express 16 x has two more down here 

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:25.680
 That little one x 1 you see 

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:28.260
 here in these two causes will be a plaque 

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:31.230
 sound that you already have a board 

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:36.240
 or areas you choose 

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:38.790
 down here where it makes calls from the 

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:40.709
 led and dodô hd né in front of the panel

 the front of the pause button cabinet. 

00:03:40.709 --> 00:03:43.080
 reset button the question these inputs 

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:46.530

 here we have two USBs we also call 

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:52.050
 the front panel of the enclosure or the 

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:53.730
 front here back on the motherboard give you 4 

00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:56.130
 serve s 

00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:57.570
 here we put a fan and fan of 

00:03:56.130 --> 00:04:01.620
 office for making life easier

 improve what's good even from audio to 

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:06.660
 do board plate right angle extension 

00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:08.820
 board there with the front panel of the 

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:11.100
 standard motherboard on the motherboards already 

00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:17.850
 noticed that it is more or less always 

00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:21.359
 so I'm already used to it and 14 pins of the 

00:04:17.850 --> 00:04:23.190
 of the power supply so here it is 

00:04:21.359 --> 00:04:27.240
 the personal plaque for those who enter 

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:31.650

 to connect keyboard mouse majority 

00:04:44.729 --> 00:04:50.600
 using sbn is nowadays but still has 

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:54.270
 people who use people back there then 

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:55.940
 what is the little ball show plaque
