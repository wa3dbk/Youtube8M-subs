00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:05.120
 hello in this opportunity I'm going to 

00:00:02.659 --> 00:00:07.350
 show the characteristics that the 

00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:09.210
 digital microscope usb 

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:11.790
 punctually what you are seeing now 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:14.510
 is the application in electronics back 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:18.280
 at the tip a standard common text 

00:00:14.510 --> 00:00:20.530
 those are micro resistors 

00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:22.010
 the memories to the lack of left 

00:00:20.530 --> 00:00:23.930
 straight 

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:25.280
 in the pair of options preview it 

00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:28.160
 can see the resolutions that can 

00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:29.720
 show the micro capture program 

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:32.540
 you can turn left to the 

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:34.490
 right the image turn on the time and the 

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:37.580
 date to appear 

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:40.230
 and it shows the full screen language and 

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:42.149
 in preferences 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:44.610
 different effects that can be given to 

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:47.180
 the image this is typical of the device not 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:47.180
 there is program 

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:58.520
 face tracking what it allows is to make a 

00:00:56.270 --> 00:01:00.950
 Full screen tracking with 

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:04.360
 a much faster capture speed 

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:04.360
 fast than the full screen 

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:17.770
 manual are allows to be able to do without 

00:01:16.299 --> 00:01:20.859
 import the resolution you have 

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:22.539
 obviously it's a digital zoom going to 

00:01:20.859 --> 00:01:25.299
 degrade my image as it increases 

00:01:22.539 --> 00:01:27.159
 unless it is in a resolution 

00:01:25.299 --> 00:01:29.520
 low and one goes increasing it to 

00:01:27.159 --> 00:01:32.610
 reach the optimal resolution of 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:32.610
 digital microscope 

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:56.340
 the button take a photo allows 

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:59.610
 obviously what makes taking a picture in 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:02.270
 the moment that we have centered a 

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:02.270
 microscope 

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:08.780
 is quite useful or less for the 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:08.780
 application in electronics 

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:17.590
 in what is shown is how squeezing 

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:19.860
 the video button can be recorded a 

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:19.860
 video 

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:39.110
 the program has its own player 

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:39.110
 that allows you to show the recorded video 

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:50.210
 the noises and images are saved in 

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:50.210
 preset directories 

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:06.600
 the button looks like a cross on a cross 

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:08.180
 expansion and precisely make screen 

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:12.410
 where is the application in this case 

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:12.410
 that absurd show a life 

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:17.620
 what they are seeing now is 

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:27.459
 never pound 

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:33.540
 and it is shown with a purpose 

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:39.769
 with advanced options 1 can be 

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:42.680
 public horizontal or vertical this 

00:03:39.769 --> 00:03:44.300
 quite useful because if the microscope 

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:46.459
 like any other depends as one the 

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:48.920
 dea re in being waving 

00:03:46.459 --> 00:03:51.110
 up may the bio go to 

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:54.250
 down and quite uncomfortable unless if 

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:54.250
 It is pulled in this way 

00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:07.110
 there it is being achieved to the south 

00:04:11.850 --> 00:04:15.320
 for us in the x 

00:04:15.350 --> 00:04:20.720
 many great that that is not 800 x but if 

00:04:18.110 --> 00:04:25.220
 I do not get a nice standard that 

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:29.570
 has a resolution of 1024 x 768 and 7 a 

00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:32.240
 1024 x 768 really takes the measurements and 

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:34.550
 multiply it by the values ​​that you see 

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:36.890
 in preview remember that the size 

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:38.870
 in itself that would have the representation of 

00:04:36.890 --> 00:04:43.720
 that millimeter of black line black line 

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:43.720
 they are really 800 min 

00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:54.890
 and that increase by 640 480 800 without any 

00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:54.890
 increase the image 

00:04:55.550 --> 00:05:01.120
 after increasing 

00:04:58.280 --> 00:05:01.120
 to the maximum 

00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:07.990
 equal in percent can not be appreciated 

00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:11.310
 with me they obviously have the monitor that 

00:05:07.990 --> 00:05:11.310
 is having you
