00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.589
 hello to all welcome of which I pay 

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:06.629
 share today I want to redo the 

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:08.580
 video that I've done before but 

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:11.580
 I do them a little in the bowl I make them 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:14.250
 quickly to respond to requests 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:17.279
 so today we will see how I 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:22.710
 fill me my casting reel so 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:24.689
 here I chose an outline we need 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:28.140
 from nil to so because I put a 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:30.689
 backing that's it depends on everyone in 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:32.340
 anyway I put backing to do not 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:35.280
 not so that the braid clings well 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:36.390
 and for not there is the reason for 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:41.820
 which is especially not to 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:44.489
 wasting my pen a knife 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:52.350
 or a chisel so for starters I'm going 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:57.110
 take the pinwheel with the kite I the 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:57.110
 so go through the hole there 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:07.770
 and once in I pass in a 

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:15.000
 hole and I come out of it the other one 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:18.869
 parallel tale is not obvious here 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:21.979
 we arrive and after that we can do 

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:28.320
 any do I make a 

00:01:21.979 --> 00:01:30.710
 set double not single I cut the 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:30.710
 surplus 

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:37.090
 we have 

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:40.320
 alas my reel 

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:43.859
 so 

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:55.250
 I use my brake and walt and I mouline 

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:59.890
 I put it pretty much in the soothsayers 

00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:59.890
 up to 30 meters of nylon 

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:24.220
 here 

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:27.370
 I'm falling as soon as I get everything I 'm coming 

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:30.280
 still to see the holes of the reel I 

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:32.739
 do not stop me so here is for the 

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:35.500
 frozen braid already mounted on a reel 

00:02:32.739 --> 00:02:36.760
 for it to be easier and the 

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:39.060
 press when you go to see in the 

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:41.739
 video after I have two kinds of braids 

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:45.489
 so the press she's not going to see 

00:02:41.739 --> 00:02:47.709
 water is a truce that is worn but 

00:02:45.489 --> 00:02:49.980
 I always put it for not and it's 

00:02:47.709 --> 00:02:51.310
 a physio braid which is not a 

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:54.970
 known brand 

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:57.239
 so I put it only for not 

00:02:54.970 --> 00:03:00.160
 wasting mattress that I paid dearly 

00:02:57.239 --> 00:03:04.510
 so alas the most important is the 

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:08.170
 knot look well we take the kite and 

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:10.040
 the press have the langes it seems one 

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:12.680
 on the other 

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:15.879
 on one side of a side I take both 

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:23.030
 I make a loop I take the braid 

00:03:15.879 --> 00:03:25.219
 I pass it 4 x 2 which we will have 

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:27.400
 taking the braid and the nylon at the same 

00:03:25.219 --> 00:03:27.400
 time 

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:39.530
 I'm milling I pull the little end towards the 

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:42.290
 blow I do not know too much after I do 

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:44.930
 the same thing on the other side is this 

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:47.330
 time it's the milan that will go into 

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:53.720
 the loop always we take the braid 

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:57.440
 and the nile in four years I wet 

00:03:53.720 --> 00:04:03.200
 I stretch a little and there I am going to wet 

00:03:57.440 --> 00:04:05.239
 between the two knots I pull the nylon 

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:07.569
 dan side and the a13 of the other they go 

00:04:05.239 --> 00:04:11.390
 start to get closer 

00:04:07.569 --> 00:04:14.180
 and here I can go to test your 

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:16.299
 do not hesitate to go there and there 

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:17.570
 you do not go that much wrong 

00:04:16.299 --> 00:04:20.120
 to cut yourself 

00:04:17.570 --> 00:04:22.720
 so that means that it is good the 

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:22.720
 cut out the additions 

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:28.070
 we 

00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:39.800
 here 

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:43.930
 and here I serve, I must 

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:46.930
 have a tension between the reel 

00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:46.930
 here 

00:05:09.380 --> 00:05:15.670
 so all that's press he's going 

00:05:12.950 --> 00:05:15.670
 not see the oim 

00:05:32.849 --> 00:05:40.159
 and there it is my press that I have 

00:05:37.619 --> 00:05:44.219
 connect so the same thing as before 

00:05:40.159 --> 00:05:46.740
 it's the kind surgeon already tuned 

00:05:44.219 --> 00:05:51.990
 before she is ready she is very 

00:05:46.740 --> 00:05:56.869
 solid and I continue to mill and to 

00:05:51.990 --> 00:05:56.869
 fill my older boy 

00:06:50.420 --> 00:06:54.660
 here I am at the end 

00:06:52.290 --> 00:06:56.820
 normally I could still fill it 

00:06:54.660 --> 00:06:57.900
 but here I have more than 150 meters of 

00:06:56.820 --> 00:07:01.110
 braids that is largely enough 

00:06:57.900 --> 00:07:04.710
 it's 22 percent so 

00:07:01.110 --> 00:07:05.010
 here I hope the video will be 

00:07:04.710 --> 00:07:06.390
 useful 

00:07:05.010 --> 00:07:08.400

00:07:06.390 --> 00:07:11.409
