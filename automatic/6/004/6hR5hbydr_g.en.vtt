00:00:06.070 --> 00:00:09.219
 in general, what are the contacts 

00:00:09.219 --> 00:00:11.609
 now move the compass from the data and 

00:00:11.609 --> 00:00:14.999
 moved information to the database because 

00:00:14.999 --> 00:00:16.810
 What is the difference 

00:00:16.810 --> 00:00:18.730
 saves spelled out 

00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:19.689

 text our guard sa sam 

00:00:24.599 --> 00:00:25.509
 data 

00:00:25.509 --> 00:00:27.779
 and when snacks are needed 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:30.089
 connects these databases with code 

00:00:30.089 --> 00:00:31.890
 at 4 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:33.590
 speeds up work 

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:34.640
 decreases

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:42.200
 promotes 

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:43.510
 automation 

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:45.320
 work of our site 

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:48.560
 so frozen databases 

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:50.450
 we move 

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:52.120
 our server 

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:54.270
 for this he must be imprisoned than u 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:55.660
 I'm already running 

00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:57.370
 and here we go to 

00:00:57.370 --> 00:00:58.880
 and parcels 

00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:00.500
 but the collective farm 

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:01.840
 parable note 

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:03.070
 may however 

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:04.649
 mother's right to exchange 

00:01:04.649 --> 00:01:05.990
 allows 

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:07.540
 manages databases 

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:09.140
 knowing the square 

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:12.360
 let's create it here 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:14.700
 database 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:16.510
 well, let's call her 

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:19.510
 my site 

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:22.560
 my site 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:24.940
 to create 

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:26.070
 so and 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:28.860
 here you will see them 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:30.620
 but more data 

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:32.560
 created by 

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:33.980
 may site 

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:36.190
 in this database 

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:38.350
 create a table 

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:40.810
 from so far what is this report points about 

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:41.950
 what 

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:43.360
 empty base 

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:45.310
 and probably he 

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:47.230
 with this 

00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:48.400
 with this with 

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:50.440
 installations 

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:52.880
 let's set six fields 

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:55.790
 sixth 

00:01:55.790 --> 00:01:58.910
 at the same time we are hiding 

00:01:58.910 --> 00:02:02.040
 set by set 

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:04.240
 in subsequent years there was a Pole 

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:05.250
 fill in 

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:07.810
 first taiga 

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:10.810
 here you have type 

00:02:11.349 --> 00:02:12.789
 this field 

00:02:12.789 --> 00:02:14.810
 choose a whole cleaning and 

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:18.040
 but it is cheap selling 1 2 3 4 5 length 

00:02:18.619 --> 00:02:20.829
 let it be 2 

00:02:20.829 --> 00:02:22.199
 farther 

00:02:22.199 --> 00:02:24.159
 additional leave but here 

00:02:24.159 --> 00:02:26.719
 change and primary key 

00:02:26.719 --> 00:02:28.399
 next field 

00:02:28.399 --> 00:02:31.079
 This field visitors will be stored

00:02:45.249 --> 00:02:46.559
 such leave 

00:02:46.559 --> 00:02:48.249
 is there some more 

00:02:48.249 --> 00:02:50.369
 the next is

00:03:12.379 --> 00:03:13.709
 allowed 

00:03:13.709 --> 00:03:14.879
 we need for search engines 

00:03:14.879 --> 00:03:16.509
 understanding 

00:03:16.509 --> 00:03:18.289
 as if

00:03:25.719 --> 00:03:27.379
 page content 

00:03:27.379 --> 00:03:29.419
 ooo cooler in their words 

00:03:29.419 --> 00:03:30.919
 keywords which task 

00:03:30.919 --> 00:03:33.029
 appears on our page 

00:03:33.029 --> 00:03:35.899
 all these are search engine taxes 

00:03:35.899 --> 00:03:39.109
 so methods 

00:03:39.109 --> 00:03:40.849
 methods 

00:03:40.849 --> 00:03:44.179
