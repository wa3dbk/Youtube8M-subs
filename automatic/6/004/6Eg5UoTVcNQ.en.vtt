00:04:50.419 --> 00:04:52.360 

yep

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:52.370 
yep

00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:55.470 
yep
we<00:04:52.700> go<00:04:52.910> and<00:04:53.630> we'll<00:04:53.960> just<00:04:54.050> put<00:04:54.260> there<00:04:54.440> to<00:04:54.680> go<00:04:54.860> and

00:05:34.750 --> 00:05:38.430 
that you will usually crash around this
point<00:05:35.520> because<00:05:36.520> I<00:05:36.789> guess<00:05:37.060> the<00:05:37.419> soldiers<00:05:38.139> or

00:05:38.430 --> 00:05:38.440 
point because I guess the soldiers or

00:05:38.440 --> 00:05:43.890 
point because I guess the soldiers or
the<00:05:38.530> foot<00:05:38.910> foot<00:05:40.560> crap

00:05:43.890 --> 00:05:43.900 

00:05:43.900 --> 00:05:47.129 

how<00:05:44.620> discomforts<00:05:45.190> hold<00:05:45.370> your<00:05:45.520> spider<00:05:46.139> they

00:05:47.129 --> 00:05:47.139 
how discomforts hold your spider they

00:05:47.139 --> 00:05:49.620 
how discomforts hold your spider they
have<00:05:47.410> that<00:05:47.680> I<00:05:47.740> guess<00:05:47.979> they<00:05:48.160> use<00:05:48.400> the<00:05:48.639> human<00:05:49.060> to

00:05:49.620 --> 00:05:49.630 
have that I guess they use the human to

00:05:49.630 --> 00:05:54.390 
have that I guess they use the human to
diagnose<00:05:50.440> good<00:05:50.830> and<00:05:51.150> that's<00:05:52.229> is<00:05:53.229> what<00:05:53.470> makes

00:05:54.390 --> 00:05:54.400 
diagnose good and that's is what makes

00:05:54.400 --> 00:05:56.939 
diagnose good and that's is what makes
the<00:05:54.550> game<00:05:54.669> crash<00:05:54.970> because<00:05:55.180> the<00:05:55.800> current<00:05:56.800> one

00:05:56.939 --> 00:05:56.949 
the game crash because the current one

00:05:56.949 --> 00:05:59.850 
the game crash because the current one
