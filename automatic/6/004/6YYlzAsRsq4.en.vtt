that it will crack occasionally is the

00:03:09.099 --> 00:03:11.009 
that it will crack occasionally is the
addition<00:03:09.400> of<00:03:09.489> cream<00:03:09.819> that's<00:03:10.299> what<00:03:10.510> makes<00:03:10.840> the

00:03:11.009 --> 00:03:11.019 
addition of cream that's what makes the

00:03:11.019 --> 00:03:12.780
