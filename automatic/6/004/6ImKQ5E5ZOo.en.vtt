00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:40.260 
just to dress it up a little bit the

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:43.880 
just to dress it up a little bit the
strained<00:00:40.649> actually<00:00:41.809> it's<00:00:42.809> two<00:00:43.260> parts<00:00:43.590> that

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890 
strained actually it's two parts that

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:48.529 
strained actually it's two parts that
they<00:00:44.010> were<00:00:44.190> glued<00:00:44.789> together<00:00:45.090> I<00:00:45.450> think<00:00:45.660> and<00:00:47.539> it

00:00:48.529 --> 00:00:48.539 
they were glued together I think and it

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:50.979 
they were glued together I think and it
came<00:00:48.750> off<00:00:48.960> of<00:00:48.989> this<00:00:49.320> louis<00:00:49.950> vuitton<00:00:50.280> vernis

00:00:50.979 --> 00:00:50.989

00:00:50.989 --> 00:00:53.900 
came off of this louis vuitton vernis
tinmar<00:00:51.989> purse<00:00:52.320> it's<00:00:52.890> a<00:00:53.039> passport<00:00:53.280> case<00:00:53.760> I

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910 
tinmar purse it's a passport case I

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:56.240 
tinmar purse it's a passport case I
think<00:00:54.079> but<00:00:55.079> anyways<00:00:55.410> I<00:00:55.559> wasn't<00:00:55.800> using<00:00:55.980> it

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
think but anyways I wasn't using it

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:58.549 
think but anyways I wasn't using it
because<00:00:56.399> the<00:00:56.760> patents<00:00:57.270> peeling<00:00:57.750> off<00:00:57.899> of<00:00:58.170> it<00:00:58.350> so

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
because the patents peeling off of it so

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:01.310 
because the patents peeling off of it so
you<00:00:59.070> know<00:00:59.399> who<00:00:59.579> cares<00:00:59.879> but<00:01:00.719> anyways<00:01:01.109> I<00:01:01.260> took

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320 
you know who cares but anyways I took

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:03.460 
you know who cares but anyways I took
the<00:01:01.649> strings<00:01:01.949> up<00:01:02.160> of<00:01:02.370> it<00:01:02.489> and<00:01:02.640> peel<00:01:02.820> them<00:01:03.000> apart

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:03.470 
the strings up of it and peel them apart

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:07.880 
the strings up of it and peel them apart
so<00:01:04.470> I<00:01:04.500> ended<00:01:04.920> up<00:01:05.040> having<00:01:05.400> two<00:01:05.700> strings<00:01:06.890> instead

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
so I ended up having two strings instead

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:10.429 
so I ended up having two strings instead
of<00:01:08.130> just<00:01:08.340> one<00:01:08.720> so<00:01:09.720> now<00:01:09.869> I've<00:01:09.960> got<00:01:10.110> a<00:01:10.140> backup

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:10.439
