previous nova tech 70 amp esc they have

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:01.990 
previous nova tech 70 amp esc they have
now<00:03:00.320> gone<00:03:00.380> with<00:03:00.830> a<00:03:00.860> different<00:03:01.250> type<00:03:01.400> of<00:03:01.430> esc

00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:02.000 
now gone with a different type of esc

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:05.620 
now gone with a different type of esc
and<00:03:02.770> it<00:03:03.770> looks<00:03:04.160> similar<00:03:04.730> to<00:03:05.060> the<00:03:05.150> hobby<00:03:05.360> wings

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:05.630 
and it looks similar to the hobby wings

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:07.600 
and it looks similar to the hobby wings
that<00:03:05.810> might<00:03:06.080> be<00:03:06.260> able<00:03:06.410> to<00:03:06.560> be<00:03:06.830> programmed<00:03:07.190> with

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:07.610 
that might be able to be programmed with

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:10.300 
that might be able to be programmed with
a<00:03:07.640> hobby<00:03:07.880> hobby<00:03:08.420> wing<00:03:08.780> a<00:03:09.020> program<00:03:09.860> card<00:03:10.130> I'll

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:10.310 
a hobby hobby wing a program card I'll

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:13.150 
a hobby hobby wing a program card I'll
try<00:03:10.520> that<00:03:10.550> out<00:03:10.910> a<00:03:11.120> couple<00:03:11.570> minutes<00:03:11.990> I<00:03:12.200> plug<00:03:13.040> the

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:13.160 
try that out a couple minutes I plug the

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:17.710 
try that out a couple minutes I plug the
battery<00:03:13.520> in<00:03:13.640> earlier<00:03:14.230> so<00:03:15.230> we<00:03:15.380> can<00:03:16.450> test<00:03:17.450> it<00:03:17.600> out

00:03:17.710 --> 00:03:17.720 
battery in earlier so we can test it out

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:20.080 
battery in earlier so we can test it out
cool<00:03:18.500> thing<00:03:18.650> about<00:03:18.770> this<00:03:19.010> new<00:03:19.220> esc<00:03:19.640> is<00:03:19.790> it<00:03:19.940> also

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:20.090 
cool thing about this new esc is it also

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:21.970 
cool thing about this new esc is it also
includes<00:03:20.600> a<00:03:20.750> fan<00:03:21.080> which<00:03:21.350> keeps<00:03:21.620> it<00:03:21.770> nice<00:03:21.920> and

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:35.630 
you this cool new battery that it comes

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:38.530 
you this cool new battery that it comes
with<00:03:36.070> it<00:03:37.070> comes<00:03:37.310> with<00:03:37.459> a<00:03:37.489> 7<00:03:37.910> cell<00:03:38.090> nickel<00:03:38.450> metal

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:38.540 
with it comes with a 7 cell nickel metal

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:40.479 
with it comes with a 7 cell nickel metal
hydride<00:03:38.720> instead<00:03:39.440> of<00:03:39.560> the<00:03:39.680> previous<00:03:40.190> six

00:03:40.479 --> 00:03:40.489 
hydride instead of the previous six

00:03:40.489 --> 00:03:43.210 
hydride instead of the previous six
cells<00:03:41.140> again<00:03:42.140> this<00:03:42.260> is<00:03:42.440> only<00:03:42.620> on<00:03:42.860> the<00:03:42.980> pro

00:03:43.210 --> 00:03:43.220 
cells again this is only on the pro

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:44.830 
cells again this is only on the pro
version<00:03:43.250> that<00:03:43.820> you'll<00:03:43.940> get<00:03:44.150> the<00:03:44.270> 7<00:03:44.630> cell

00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:44.840 
version that you'll get the 7 cell

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:47.110 
version that you'll get the 7 cell
nickel<00:03:45.230> metal<00:03:45.350> hydride<00:03:45.500> battery<00:03:46.220> it's<00:03:46.880> a<00:03:46.940> lot

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:47.120 
nickel metal hydride battery it's a lot

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:49.330 
nickel metal hydride battery it's a lot
thicker<00:03:47.420> it's<00:03:47.810> actually<00:03:48.170> a<00:03:48.200> 3000<00:03:49.070> milliamp

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:49.340 
thicker it's actually a 3000 milliamp

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:51.820 
thicker it's actually a 3000 milliamp
hour<00:03:49.640> instead<00:03:50.450> of<00:03:50.630> the<00:03:50.750> previous<00:03:51.140> 1800

00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:51.830 
hour instead of the previous 1800

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:53.410 
hour instead of the previous 1800
milliamp<00:03:52.190> hour<00:03:52.340> which<00:03:52.550> gives<00:03:52.790> you<00:03:52.910> longer<00:03:53.150> run

00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:53.420 
milliamp hour which gives you longer run

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:55.840 
milliamp hour which gives you longer run
times<00:03:53.750> and<00:03:54.020> more<00:03:54.260> power<00:03:54.500> this<00:03:55.130> I<00:03:55.459> think<00:03:55.580> this

00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:55.850 
times and more power this I think this

00:03:55.850 --> 00:03:58.690 
times and more power this I think this
is<00:03:56.030> one<00:03:56.330> of<00:03:56.390> the<00:03:56.510> best<00:03:56.810> features<00:03:57.220> great<00:03:58.220> best

00:03:58.690 --> 00:03:58.700 
is one of the best features great best
