00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:17.250 
thought first if that's the case we will

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:19.700 
thought first if that's the case we will
not<00:00:17.430> see<00:00:17.730> it<00:00:17.880> on<00:00:18.060> google<00:00:18.090> i/o<00:00:18.630> this<00:00:18.960> may<00:00:19.439> a

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:25.830 
always owned listening mode so that you

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:28.130 
always owned listening mode so that you
can<00:00:26.010> wake<00:00:26.580> up<00:00:26.820> the<00:00:26.880> device<00:00:27.330> with<00:00:27.689> your<00:00:27.869> voice

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690 
mode it starts the camera so it's ready

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:03.500 
mode it starts the camera so it's ready
to<00:01:01.079> take<00:01:01.530> a<00:01:01.559> photo<00:01:01.890> for<00:01:02.010> example<00:01:02.699> that<00:01:03.239> could

to take a photo for example that could

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:05.630 
to take a photo for example that could
also<00:01:03.690> be<00:01:03.840> possible<00:01:04.170> because<00:01:04.589> google<00:01:05.489> has<00:01:05.610> a

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
also be possible because google has a

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:08.210 
also be possible because google has a
new<00:01:05.820> patent<00:01:06.630> for<00:01:07.020> a<00:01:07.049> machine<00:01:07.619> learning

kind of things the phone will learn how

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:17.570 
kind of things the phone will learn how
you<00:01:14.189> use<00:01:14.640> it<00:01:14.670> and<00:01:15.380> start<00:01:16.380> applications<00:01:17.340> and

services depending on where you are at a

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:23.510 
services depending on where you are at a
moment<00:01:20.100> your<00:01:20.880> location<00:01:21.689> and<00:01:21.960> how<00:01:22.950> you<00:01:23.009> hold

moment your location and how you hold
the<00:01:23.759> phone<00:01:24.030> and<00:01:24.299> so<00:01:24.479> on<00:01:24.689> so<00:01:25.080> this<00:01:25.890> feature

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
the phone and so on so this feature

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:30.020 
the phone and so on so this feature
could<00:01:26.700> be<00:01:26.939> true<00:01:27.840> and<00:01:28.080> it<00:01:28.740> sounds<00:01:29.280> a<00:01:29.369> very<00:01:29.400> very

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
could be true and it sounds a very very

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:32.539 
could be true and it sounds a very very
interesting<00:01:30.659> and<00:01:30.770> Exum<00:01:31.770> will<00:01:32.040> apparently

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549 
interesting and Exum will apparently

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:35.810 
interesting and Exum will apparently
also<00:01:32.970> be<00:01:33.360> always<00:01:33.659> connected<00:01:34.439> to<00:01:35.009> the<00:01:35.189> chrome

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820 
also be always connected to the chrome

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:38.300 
also be always connected to the chrome
web<00:01:36.180> browser<00:01:36.290> that<00:01:37.290> could<00:01:37.470> also<00:01:37.560> be<00:01:37.770> possible

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
web browser that could also be possible

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:42.289 
web browser that could also be possible
because<00:01:38.990> the<00:01:39.990> chrome<00:01:40.259> was<00:01:40.590> both<00:01:41.369> us<00:01:42.030> now

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:42.299 
because the chrome was both us now

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:46.639 
because the chrome was both us now
taking<00:01:42.840> over<00:01:42.990> android<00:01:43.649> so<00:01:44.509> he<00:01:45.509> will<00:01:45.750> be<00:01:46.020> the

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:46.649 
taking over android so he will be the

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:49.520 
taking over android so he will be the
boss<00:01:46.860> over<00:01:47.159> the<00:01:47.460> android<00:01:48.030> development<00:01:48.659> now<00:01:48.869> so

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:49.530 
boss over the android development now so

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:52.090 
boss over the android development now so
we<00:01:50.220> will<00:01:50.369> probably<00:01:50.579> see<00:01:50.939> more<00:01:51.420> tightly

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:52.100 
we will probably see more tightly

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:54.530 
we will probably see more tightly
integration<00:01:53.100> between<00:01:53.250> chrome<00:01:53.790> and<00:01:54.090> Android

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:54.540 
integration between chrome and Android

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:57.920 
integration between chrome and Android
and<00:01:55.079> to<00:01:55.799> me<00:01:55.950> personally<00:01:55.979> I<00:01:56.670> think<00:01:56.820> we<00:01:57.600> will<00:01:57.750> see

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:57.930 
and to me personally I think we will see

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:01.039 
and to me personally I think we will see
a<00:01:57.960> merge<00:01:58.320> somehow<00:01:59.219> in<00:02:00.060> the<00:02:00.299> future<00:02:00.780> between

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:01.049 
a merge somehow in the future between

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:04.280 
a merge somehow in the future between
Chrome<00:02:01.619> OS<00:02:01.649> and<00:02:02.219> Android<00:02:02.840> this<00:02:03.840> new<00:02:04.049> feature

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:04.290 
Chrome OS and Android this new feature

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:07.249 
Chrome OS and Android this new feature
could<00:02:04.710> allow<00:02:04.979> you<00:02:05.040> to<00:02:05.630> respond<00:02:06.630> to<00:02:06.840> text

00:02:07.249 --> 00:02:07.259 
could allow you to respond to text

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:10.699 
could allow you to respond to text
messages<00:02:07.920> find<00:02:08.550> your<00:02:08.819> phone<00:02:09.119> and<00:02:09.720> access<00:02:10.530> your

probably have a specific event for this
sometime<00:03:10.129> in<00:03:10.340> June<00:03:11.060> July<00:03:11.450> where<00:03:11.840> what<00:03:12.530> they

00:03:12.699 --> 00:03:12.709

will announce the motorola x phone
instead<00:03:15.379> and<00:03:15.980> that<00:03:16.310> could<00:03:16.519> be<00:03:16.549> a<00:03:16.940> great<00:03:17.419> way

00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:17.750 
instead and that could be a great way

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:19.990 
instead and that could be a great way
for<00:03:17.810> marketing<00:03:18.560> leaving<00:03:19.489> that<00:03:19.699> for<00:03:19.970> a

00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:20.000 
for marketing leaving that for a

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:23.229 
for marketing leaving that for a
specific<00:03:20.449> event<00:03:21.139> for<00:03:21.650> this<00:03:21.829> kind<00:03:22.370> of<00:03:22.519> device<00:03:22.940> i

think that could be a great way doing it
because<00:03:26.299> this<00:03:26.750> is<00:03:26.989> quite<00:03:27.410> big<00:03:27.769> the<00:03:28.730> motorola<00:03:29.030> x

00:03:29.409 --> 00:03:29.419 
because this is quite big the motorola x
