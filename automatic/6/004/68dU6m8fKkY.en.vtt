00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:23.160 
the galaxy s5 three two one and I'm very

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:24.620 
the galaxy s5 three two one and I'm very
mind<00:00:23.400> that<00:00:23.550> it<00:00:23.640> has<00:00:23.789> just<00:00:23.970> been<00:00:24.180> released<00:00:24.330> and

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:24.630 
mind that it has just been released and

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:25.759 
mind that it has just been released and
the<00:00:24.720> s5<00:00:25.019> has<00:00:25.140> been<00:00:25.260> out<00:00:25.350> for<00:00:25.470> a<00:00:25.529> while<00:00:25.740> but

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:25.769 
the s5 has been out for a while but

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:27.259 
the s5 has been out for a while but
nonetheless<00:00:26.310> that's<00:00:26.730> still<00:00:26.970> pretty

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:27.269 
nonetheless that's still pretty

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:29.029 
nonetheless that's still pretty
impressive<00:00:27.750> considering<00:00:28.260> you<00:00:28.859> know<00:00:28.949> the

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:29.039 
impressive considering you know the

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:31.070 
impressive considering you know the
galaxy<00:00:29.220> s5<00:00:29.640> is<00:00:29.880> sort<00:00:30.060> of<00:00:30.090> the<00:00:30.240> flagship<00:00:30.779> of<00:00:30.929> all

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:31.080 
galaxy s5 is sort of the flagship of all

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:33.290 
galaxy s5 is sort of the flagship of all
flagships<00:00:31.710> I<00:00:31.920> think<00:00:32.130> there's<00:00:32.759> more<00:00:33.030> hype

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:33.300 
flagships I think there's more hype

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:34.850 
flagships I think there's more hype
about<00:00:33.480> Samsung's<00:00:34.110> things<00:00:34.350> than<00:00:34.590> just<00:00:34.739> about

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:34.860 
about Samsung's things than just about

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:36.950 
about Samsung's things than just about
any<00:00:35.040> other<00:00:35.130> manufacturers<00:00:35.940> so<00:00:36.120> I'll<00:00:36.570> just<00:00:36.809> I'm

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:36.960 
any other manufacturers so I'll just I'm

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:38.479 
any other manufacturers so I'll just I'm
pretty<00:00:37.200> well<00:00:37.380> here<00:00:37.620> and<00:00:38.070> I<00:00:38.160> think<00:00:38.309> there's<00:00:38.430> a

00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:38.489 
pretty well here and I think there's a

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:39.889 
pretty well here and I think there's a
couple<00:00:38.640> of<00:00:38.820> things<00:00:38.940> that<00:00:39.120> have<00:00:39.360> really<00:00:39.690> made

00:00:39.889 --> 00:00:39.899 
couple of things that have really made

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:41.660 
couple of things that have really made
that<00:00:40.110> happen<00:00:40.290> the<00:00:40.920> number<00:00:41.160> one<00:00:41.280> is<00:00:41.520> the

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670 
that happen the number one is the

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:43.340 
that happen the number one is the
display<00:00:42.059> a<00:00:42.390> lot<00:00:42.899> of<00:00:42.989> people<00:00:43.170> have<00:00:43.290> been

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:43.350 
display a lot of people have been

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:45.200 
display a lot of people have been
complaining<00:00:43.530> about<00:00:44.010> this<00:00:44.309> and<00:00:44.610> obviously<00:00:45.059> I'm

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210 
complaining about this and obviously I'm

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:48.200 
complaining about this and obviously I'm
not<00:00:45.239> a<00:00:45.420> massive<00:00:45.750> fan<00:00:45.960> but<00:00:46.200> LG<00:00:46.829> a<00:00:47.070> qHD<00:00:47.969> display

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:48.210 
not a massive fan but LG a qHD display

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:50.990 
not a massive fan but LG a qHD display
on<00:00:48.690> the<00:00:48.780> LG<00:00:49.020> g3<00:00:49.230> and<00:00:49.530> that<00:00:49.770> was<00:00:49.920> kind<00:00:50.160> of<00:00:50.219> a<00:00:50.640> very

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
on the LG g3 and that was kind of a very

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:52.850 
on the LG g3 and that was kind of a very
brave<00:00:51.270> move<00:00:51.480> probably<00:00:52.020> quite<00:00:52.140> a<00:00:52.199> costly<00:00:52.590> move

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.860 
brave move probably quite a costly move

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:54.470 
brave move probably quite a costly move
but<00:00:53.160> at<00:00:53.250> the<00:00:53.340> same<00:00:53.489> time<00:00:53.730> I<00:00:53.789> think<00:00:53.969> it<00:00:54.149> was<00:00:54.210> very

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
but at the same time I think it was very

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:56.510 
but at the same time I think it was very
good<00:00:54.690> for<00:00:54.840> marketing<00:00:55.289> if<00:00:55.680> they<00:00:56.219> are<00:00:56.340> just

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.520 
good for marketing if they are just

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:57.920 
good for marketing if they are just
forming<00:00:56.760> 210<00:00:57.000> AIDS<00:00:57.149> people<00:00:57.510> are<00:00:57.570> not<00:00:57.750> there

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930 
forming 210 AIDS people are not there

00:00:57.930 --> 00:00:59.119 
forming 210 AIDS people are not there
would<00:00:57.989> have<00:00:58.079> been<00:00:58.140> literally<00:00:58.590> nothing<00:00:58.829> to

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
would have been literally nothing to

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:01.880 
would have been literally nothing to
separate<00:00:59.489> the<00:00:59.699> LG<00:00:59.940> g3<00:01:00.270> from<00:01:01.170> the<00:01:01.289> competition

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
separate the LG g3 from the competition

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:04.100 
separate the LG g3 from the competition
now<00:01:02.550> they<00:01:02.670> also<00:01:02.789> decided<00:01:03.210> to<00:01:03.359> adopt<00:01:03.570> a<00:01:03.780> metal

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
now they also decided to adopt a metal

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:06.350 
now they also decided to adopt a metal
body<00:01:04.350> which<00:01:04.619> is<00:01:04.799> seen<00:01:05.460> before<00:01:05.939> you<00:01:06.150> know<00:01:06.270> on

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
body which is seen before you know on

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:08.060 
body which is seen before you know on
the<00:01:06.450> HTC<00:01:06.659> One<00:01:06.930> m8<00:01:07.170> and<00:01:07.229> other<00:01:07.650> things<00:01:07.920> like

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
the HTC One m8 and other things like

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:10.160 
the HTC One m8 and other things like
that<00:01:08.130> but<00:01:08.520> I<00:01:08.790> think<00:01:09.210> you<00:01:09.600> know<00:01:09.720> the<00:01:10.140> whole

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170 
that but I think you know the whole

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:11.630 
that but I think you know the whole
package<00:01:10.619> code<00:01:10.830> comes<00:01:11.100> together<00:01:11.250> quite<00:01:11.610> nicely

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
package code comes together quite nicely

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:14.780 
package code comes together quite nicely
you<00:01:12.479> know<00:01:12.570> it's<00:01:12.659> got<00:01:12.750> a<00:01:12.780> 5.5<00:01:13.439> inch<00:01:13.619> screen<00:01:13.790> it's

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
you know it's got a 5.5 inch screen it's

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:16.850 
you know it's got a 5.5 inch screen it's
got<00:01:14.939> an<00:01:15.030> amazing<00:01:15.360> display<00:01:15.479> and<00:01:15.990> it's<00:01:16.650> got<00:01:16.830> a

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860 
got an amazing display and it's got a

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:18.440 
got an amazing display and it's got a
nice<00:01:17.100> build<00:01:17.400> quality<00:01:17.610> so<00:01:17.909> all<00:01:18.090> comes<00:01:18.299> together

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
nice build quality so all comes together

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:20.359 
nice build quality so all comes together
to<00:01:18.600> make<00:01:18.810> a<00:01:18.840> very<00:01:19.140> very<00:01:19.200> premium<00:01:19.619> package<00:01:20.159> that

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369 
to make a very very premium package that

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:22.340 
to make a very very premium package that
hasn't<00:01:20.939> really<00:01:21.090> been<00:01:21.330> seen<00:01:21.720> on<00:01:21.869> many<00:01:22.170> other

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
hasn't really been seen on many other

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:24.770 
hasn't really been seen on many other
devices<00:01:22.680> so<00:01:23.220> I<00:01:23.520> think<00:01:23.820> that<00:01:24.150> yes<00:01:24.330> it's

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780 
devices so I think that yes it's

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:26.060 
devices so I think that yes it's
catching<00:01:24.990> to<00:01:25.259> almost<00:01:25.470> the<00:01:25.650> kind<00:01:25.860> of<00:01:25.890> like<00:01:26.040> a

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.070 
catching to almost the kind of like a

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:27.469 
catching to almost the kind of like a
niche<00:01:26.310> audience<00:01:26.549> you<00:01:26.970> know<00:01:27.060> people<00:01:27.360> want

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:27.479 
niche audience you know people want

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:29.569 
niche audience you know people want
really<00:01:27.750> really<00:01:27.930> large<00:01:28.140> devices<00:01:28.560> but<00:01:29.009> it's

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:29.579 
really really large devices but it's

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:30.859 
really really large devices but it's
worked<00:01:29.850> whatever<00:01:30.329> they're<00:01:30.509> doing<00:01:30.600> it's

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
worked whatever they're doing it's

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:33.230 
worked whatever they're doing it's
working<00:01:31.290> so<00:01:31.560> I<00:01:31.829> say<00:01:32.369> they<00:01:32.490> stick<00:01:32.729> with<00:01:32.759> it

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
working so I say they stick with it

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:36.200 
working so I say they stick with it
now<00:01:33.720> onto<00:01:33.900> the<00:01:34.110> LG<00:01:34.380> g4<00:01:34.829> it's<00:01:35.310> you<00:01:35.820> know<00:01:35.939> I<00:01:36.150> know

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
now onto the LG g4 it's you know I know

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:38.390 
now onto the LG g4 it's you know I know
it's<00:01:36.420> kind<00:01:36.810> of<00:01:36.869> a<00:01:36.960> while<00:01:37.140> in<00:01:37.380> buns<00:01:37.680> but<00:01:38.040> I<00:01:38.189> mean

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400 
it's kind of a while in buns but I mean

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:39.410 
it's kind of a while in buns but I mean
there's<00:01:38.579> a<00:01:38.610> couple<00:01:38.850> of<00:01:38.909> things<00:01:39.060> I<00:01:39.210> would

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
there's a couple of things I would

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:42.469 
there's a couple of things I would
recommend<00:01:39.659> LG<00:01:40.290> do<00:01:40.500> in<00:01:40.979> order<00:01:41.670> to<00:01:41.850> really<00:01:42.240> well

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:42.479 
recommend LG do in order to really well

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:43.910 
recommend LG do in order to really well
people<00:01:42.869> next<00:01:43.170> year<00:01:43.229> because<00:01:43.439> it's<00:01:43.680> getting

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920 
people next year because it's getting

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:45.350 
people next year because it's getting
tougher<00:01:44.280> and<00:01:44.310> tougher<00:01:44.430> as<00:01:44.790> you<00:01:44.909> know<00:01:45.060> you<00:01:45.119> know

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:45.360 
tougher and tougher as you know you know

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:47.660 
tougher and tougher as you know you know
the<00:01:45.960> costs<00:01:46.350> of<00:01:46.470> components<00:01:46.979> is<00:01:47.040> increasing

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
the costs of components is increasing

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:49.399 
the costs of components is increasing
and<00:01:47.850> people's<00:01:48.119> expectations<00:01:48.810> keep<00:01:48.960> rising

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:49.409 
and people's expectations keep rising

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:51.830 
and people's expectations keep rising
exponentially<00:01:49.920> each<00:01:50.280> year<00:01:50.579> so<00:01:50.939> it's<00:01:51.600> going<00:01:51.780> to

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:51.840 
exponentially each year so it's going to

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:53.300 
exponentially each year so it's going to
be<00:01:51.930> difficult<00:01:52.110> especially<00:01:52.619> in<00:01:52.890> the<00:01:52.979> future

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.310 
be difficult especially in the future

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:55.550 
be difficult especially in the future
for<00:01:53.460> manufacturers<00:01:54.060> to<00:01:54.380> continue<00:01:55.380> to

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:55.560 
for manufacturers to continue to

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:57.149 
for manufacturers to continue to
actually<00:01:55.890> surprise<00:01:56.280> people<00:01:56.670> because

00:01:57.149 --> 00:01:57.159 
actually surprise people because

00:01:57.159 --> 00:01:58.200 
actually surprise people because
I<00:01:57.189> think<00:01:57.579> we're<00:01:57.700> going<00:01:57.790> to<00:01:57.880> be<00:01:57.939> seeing<00:01:58.119> more

00:01:58.200 --> 00:01:58.210 
I think we're going to be seeing more

00:01:58.210 --> 00:01:59.730 
I think we're going to be seeing more
and<00:01:58.450> more<00:01:58.600> software<00:01:58.840> innovations<00:01:59.530> throughout

00:01:59.730 --> 00:01:59.740 
and more software innovations throughout

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:02.190 
and more software innovations throughout
the<00:01:59.890> quad<00:02:00.100> renovations<00:02:00.789> and<00:02:01.210> yeah<00:02:01.990> I<00:02:02.020> think

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:02.200 
the quad renovations and yeah I think

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:04.590 
the quad renovations and yeah I think
that<00:02:02.729> consumer<00:02:03.729> expectation<00:02:04.240> is<00:02:04.329> just<00:02:04.360> way

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:04.600 
that consumer expectation is just way

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:06.870 
that consumer expectation is just way
too<00:02:04.659> high<00:02:04.990> but<00:02:05.259> you<00:02:05.740> know<00:02:05.860> if<00:02:06.009> LG<00:02:06.490> does<00:02:06.670> these

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:06.880 
too high but you know if LG does these

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:09.900 
too high but you know if LG does these
things<00:02:07.060> then<00:02:07.450> we're<00:02:08.229> in<00:02:08.410> for<00:02:08.440> a<00:02:08.649> treat<00:02:08.890> so<00:02:09.819> the

00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:09.910 
things then we're in for a treat so the

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:11.130 
things then we're in for a treat so the
first<00:02:10.119> thing<00:02:10.300> that<00:02:10.420> I<00:02:10.479> really<00:02:10.690> think<00:02:10.840> the<00:02:10.929> LG

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:11.140 
first thing that I really think the LG

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:14.250 
first thing that I really think the LG
g4<00:02:11.590> should<00:02:11.830> have<00:02:12.010> is<00:02:12.360> not<00:02:13.360> a<00:02:13.390> large<00:02:13.750> display

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:14.260 
g4 should have is not a large display

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:16.259 
g4 should have is not a large display
because<00:02:14.590> I<00:02:14.620> think<00:02:14.769> that<00:02:15.099> you<00:02:15.250> know<00:02:15.370> 505<00:02:16.120> is

00:02:16.259 --> 00:02:16.269 
because I think that you know 505 is

00:02:16.269 --> 00:02:17.790 
because I think that you know 505 is
really<00:02:16.599> pushing<00:02:16.810> and<00:02:17.200> what<00:02:17.319> tends<00:02:17.560> to<00:02:17.680> happen

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:17.800 
really pushing and what tends to happen

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:19.290 
really pushing and what tends to happen
is<00:02:18.099> manufacturers<00:02:18.790> you<00:02:18.940> know<00:02:19.030> every<00:02:19.269> year

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:19.300 
is manufacturers you know every year

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:21.059 
is manufacturers you know every year
when<00:02:19.630> they<00:02:19.720> release<00:02:19.959> a<00:02:19.989> new<00:02:20.230> device<00:02:20.590> they<00:02:20.890> will

00:02:21.059 --> 00:02:21.069 
when they release a new device they will

00:02:21.069 --> 00:02:22.890 
when they release a new device they will
you<00:02:21.700> know<00:02:21.819> incrementally<00:02:22.390> increase<00:02:22.780> the

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:22.900 
you know incrementally increase the

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:25.410 
you know incrementally increase the
display<00:02:23.230> size<00:02:23.500> and<00:02:23.769> it's<00:02:24.519> gonna<00:02:24.730> be<00:02:24.910> verging

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:25.420 
display size and it's gonna be verging

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:27.809 
display size and it's gonna be verging
very<00:02:25.870> much<00:02:26.140> on<00:02:26.380> tablet<00:02:26.800> poetry<00:02:27.280> and<00:02:27.519> I<00:02:27.610> think

00:02:27.809 --> 00:02:27.819 
very much on tablet poetry and I think

00:02:27.819 --> 00:02:30.390 
very much on tablet poetry and I think
the<00:02:27.940> 5.5<00:02:28.480> is<00:02:28.630> the<00:02:28.870> absolute<00:02:29.500> limit<00:02:30.010> for<00:02:30.220> sort

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:30.400 
the 5.5 is the absolute limit for sort

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:32.460 
the 5.5 is the absolute limit for sort
of<00:02:30.459> a<00:02:30.489> mainstream<00:02:31.060> market<00:02:31.510> phone<00:02:31.750> I<00:02:32.019> mean

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:32.470 
of a mainstream market phone I mean

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:33.900 
of a mainstream market phone I mean
clearly<00:02:32.680> the<00:02:32.860> will<00:02:33.010> be<00:02:33.130> niche<00:02:33.310> products<00:02:33.819> which

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:33.910 
clearly the will be niche products which

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:35.640 
clearly the will be niche products which
are<00:02:34.000> like<00:02:34.150> six<00:02:34.450> inches<00:02:34.630> seem<00:02:34.989> like<00:02:35.140> the<00:02:35.260> Galaxy

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:35.650 
are like six inches seem like the Galaxy

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:37.470 
are like six inches seem like the Galaxy
mega<00:02:35.799> that<00:02:36.099> kind<00:02:36.280> of<00:02:36.310> thing<00:02:36.459> but<00:02:36.610> in<00:02:37.180> order<00:02:37.420> to

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:37.480 
mega that kind of thing but in order to

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:39.990 
mega that kind of thing but in order to
actually<00:02:37.900> keep<00:02:38.410> it<00:02:38.650> into<00:02:39.040> mainstream<00:02:39.580> markets

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:40.000 
actually keep it into mainstream markets

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.000 
actually keep it into mainstream markets
L<00:02:40.540> do<00:02:40.690> you<00:02:40.780> really<00:02:41.110> need<00:02:41.260> to<00:02:41.349> keep<00:02:41.470> the<00:02:41.650> screen

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:42.010 
L do you really need to keep the screen

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:44.970 
L do you really need to keep the screen
screen<00:02:42.310> size<00:02:42.870> at<00:02:43.870> a<00:02:43.930> reasonable<00:02:44.440> level<00:02:44.590> and

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:44.980 
screen size at a reasonable level and

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:47.940 
screen size at a reasonable level and
five-point-five<00:02:45.640> really<00:02:46.060> is<00:02:46.180> kind<00:02:46.540> of<00:02:46.599> big<00:02:46.950> so

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:47.950 
five-point-five really is kind of big so

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:50.100 
five-point-five really is kind of big so
number<00:02:48.190> 2<00:02:48.340> LG<00:02:48.640> really<00:02:49.150> need<00:02:49.299> to<00:02:49.540> put<00:02:49.900> some

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:50.110 
number 2 LG really need to put some

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:53.220 
number 2 LG really need to put some
powerful<00:02:50.530> internals<00:02:51.160> on<00:02:51.280> that<00:02:51.459> so<00:02:51.790> I<00:02:52.120> mean<00:02:52.299> you

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:53.230 
powerful internals on that so I mean you

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:55.020 
powerful internals on that so I mean you
know<00:02:53.290> something<00:02:53.650> like<00:02:53.829> the<00:02:54.069> Snapdragon<00:02:54.730> 808

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:55.030 
know something like the Snapdragon 808

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:57.690 
know something like the Snapdragon 808
or<00:02:55.390> the<00:02:55.480> Snapdragon<00:02:55.959> 810<00:02:56.410> know<00:02:57.160> looking<00:02:57.549> at

00:02:57.690 --> 00:02:57.700 
or the Snapdragon 810 know looking at

00:02:57.700 --> 00:02:59.490 
or the Snapdragon 810 know looking at
LG's<00:02:57.940> previous<00:02:58.360> releases<00:02:58.660> a<00:02:58.900> lot<00:02:59.290> of<00:02:59.380> their

00:02:59.490 --> 00:02:59.500 
LG's previous releases a lot of their

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:01.319 
LG's previous releases a lot of their
devices<00:02:59.769> were<00:03:00.069> released<00:03:00.310> sort<00:03:00.579> of<00:03:00.640> towards

00:03:01.319 --> 00:03:01.329 
devices were released sort of towards

00:03:01.329 --> 00:03:03.150 
devices were released sort of towards
the<00:03:01.510> middle<00:03:01.870> of<00:03:02.079> the<00:03:02.230> year<00:03:02.470> so<00:03:02.709> sometimes

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:03.160 
the middle of the year so sometimes

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:05.220 
the middle of the year so sometimes
summer<00:03:03.489> and<00:03:03.970> by<00:03:04.269> that<00:03:04.450> time<00:03:04.480> those<00:03:04.900> chips

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:05.230 
summer and by that time those chips

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:07.349 
summer and by that time those chips
should<00:03:05.440> well<00:03:05.709> be<00:03:05.950> in<00:03:06.069> action<00:03:06.459> and<00:03:06.700> you<00:03:07.180> know<00:03:07.299> if

00:03:07.349 --> 00:03:07.359 
should well be in action and you know if

00:03:07.359 --> 00:03:08.610 
should well be in action and you know if
they<00:03:07.480> can<00:03:07.630> get<00:03:07.750> something<00:03:07.959> I'm<00:03:08.079> a-tellin

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:08.620 
they can get something I'm a-tellin

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:10.410 
they can get something I'm a-tellin
they're<00:03:08.769> amazing<00:03:09.430> I<00:03:09.609> think<00:03:09.850> it's<00:03:10.060> like<00:03:10.269> an

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:10.420 
they're amazing I think it's like an

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:12.210 
they're amazing I think it's like an
octa-core<00:03:10.750> chip<00:03:11.200> it'll<00:03:11.560> blow<00:03:11.829> away<00:03:11.980> the

00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:12.220 
octa-core chip it'll blow away the

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:14.250 
octa-core chip it'll blow away the
competition<00:03:12.370> and<00:03:12.940> I<00:03:13.000> think<00:03:13.209> if<00:03:13.720> they<00:03:13.930> get<00:03:14.079> in

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:14.260 
competition and I think if they get in

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:17.190 
competition and I think if they get in
there<00:03:14.440> before<00:03:14.560> sort<00:03:15.130> of<00:03:15.220> Samsung<00:03:15.790> and<00:03:16.120> HTC<00:03:16.389> who

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:17.200 
there before sort of Samsung and HTC who

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:18.629 
there before sort of Samsung and HTC who
tend<00:03:17.440> to<00:03:17.530> release<00:03:17.769> earlier<00:03:18.250> on<00:03:18.400> in<00:03:18.519> the<00:03:18.609> year

00:03:18.629 --> 00:03:18.639 
tend to release earlier on in the year

00:03:18.639 --> 00:03:20.789 
tend to release earlier on in the year
and<00:03:18.819> they<00:03:19.000> might<00:03:19.180> have<00:03:19.329> a<00:03:19.569> two<00:03:19.840> fives<00:03:20.319> or<00:03:20.530> two

00:03:20.789 --> 00:03:20.799 
and they might have a two fives or two

00:03:20.799 --> 00:03:22.879 
and they might have a two fives or two
eights<00:03:21.010> and<00:03:21.190> LG<00:03:21.489> will<00:03:21.609> have<00:03:21.730> a<00:03:21.760> real<00:03:22.030> step<00:03:22.329> up

00:03:22.879 --> 00:03:22.889 
eights and LG will have a real step up

00:03:22.889 --> 00:03:25.979 
eights and LG will have a real step up
also<00:03:23.889> three<00:03:24.700> gigabytes<00:03:25.000> of<00:03:25.299> RAM<00:03:25.480> I<00:03:25.630> think<00:03:25.870> is<00:03:25.959> a

00:03:25.979 --> 00:03:25.989 
also three gigabytes of RAM I think is a

00:03:25.989 --> 00:03:27.990 
also three gigabytes of RAM I think is a
necessity<00:03:26.319> I<00:03:26.620> think<00:03:26.950> that<00:03:27.190> in<00:03:27.489> this<00:03:27.819> day<00:03:27.880> and

00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:28.000 
necessity I think that in this day and

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:29.729 
necessity I think that in this day and
age<00:03:28.209> manufacturers<00:03:29.139> are<00:03:29.230> actually<00:03:29.470> sticking

00:03:29.729 --> 00:03:29.739 
age manufacturers are actually sticking

00:03:29.739 --> 00:03:31.740 
age manufacturers are actually sticking
to<00:03:30.069> two<00:03:30.400> gigabytes<00:03:30.850> of<00:03:30.940> RAM<00:03:31.150> because<00:03:31.269> they<00:03:31.540> see

00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:31.750 
to two gigabytes of RAM because they see

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:34.410 
to two gigabytes of RAM because they see
no<00:03:32.319> real<00:03:32.500> benefit<00:03:32.920> from<00:03:33.069> increasing<00:03:33.700> it<00:03:33.819> but<00:03:34.389> I

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:34.420 
no real benefit from increasing it but I

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:36.180 
no real benefit from increasing it but I
can<00:03:34.810> tell<00:03:34.989> from<00:03:35.139> previous<00:03:35.530> experience<00:03:35.980> that

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:36.190 
can tell from previous experience that

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:37.620 
can tell from previous experience that
firms<00:03:36.730> that<00:03:36.970> have<00:03:37.090> actually<00:03:37.359> had<00:03:37.450> two

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:37.630 
firms that have actually had two

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:39.660 
firms that have actually had two
gigabytes<00:03:38.109> of<00:03:38.230> RAM<00:03:38.380> in<00:03:38.560> I've<00:03:39.069> been<00:03:39.100> filling<00:03:39.489> up

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:39.670 
gigabytes of RAM in I've been filling up

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:41.129 
gigabytes of RAM in I've been filling up
very<00:03:39.940> very<00:03:40.000> quickly<00:03:40.389> you<00:03:40.540> know<00:03:40.690> as<00:03:40.780> Android

00:03:41.129 --> 00:03:41.139 
very very quickly you know as Android

00:03:41.139 --> 00:03:43.410 
very very quickly you know as Android
becomes<00:03:41.410> more<00:03:41.590> sophisticated<00:03:42.220> and<00:03:42.639> the<00:03:43.269> apps

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:43.420 
becomes more sophisticated and the apps

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:45.990 
becomes more sophisticated and the apps
become<00:03:43.660> more<00:03:43.930> demanding<00:03:44.410> I<00:03:44.620> think<00:03:44.859> that<00:03:45.100> more

00:03:45.990 --> 00:03:46.000 
become more demanding I think that more

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:49.170 
become more demanding I think that more
RAM<00:03:46.239> is<00:03:46.480> pretty<00:03:46.870> much<00:03:47.019> necessary<00:03:47.549> okay<00:03:48.549> so<00:03:48.609> the

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:49.180 
RAM is pretty much necessary okay so the

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:50.490 
RAM is pretty much necessary okay so the
next<00:03:49.299> thing<00:03:49.510> the<00:03:49.569> LG<00:03:49.840> we<00:03:49.900> really<00:03:50.139> need<00:03:50.260> to<00:03:50.350> do

00:03:50.490 --> 00:03:50.500 
next thing the LG we really need to do

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:52.319 
next thing the LG we really need to do
his<00:03:50.709> speakers<00:03:51.220> I<00:03:51.459> mean<00:03:51.639> I<00:03:51.819> can't<00:03:52.090> stress

00:03:52.319 --> 00:03:52.329 
his speakers I mean I can't stress

00:03:52.329 --> 00:03:54.539 
his speakers I mean I can't stress
enough<00:03:52.450> how<00:03:52.600> much<00:03:52.840> I<00:03:53.290> love<00:03:53.560> the<00:03:53.769> HTC<00:03:54.160> One<00:03:54.310> m8

00:03:54.539 --> 00:03:54.549 
enough how much I love the HTC One m8

00:03:54.549 --> 00:03:56.640 
enough how much I love the HTC One m8
for<00:03:54.940> its<00:03:55.090> speakers<00:03:55.540> because<00:03:55.930> honestly<00:03:56.319> apart

00:03:56.640 --> 00:03:56.650 
for its speakers because honestly apart

00:03:56.650 --> 00:03:57.930 
for its speakers because honestly apart
from<00:03:56.799> that<00:03:56.980> there's<00:03:57.370> nothing<00:03:57.700> that<00:03:57.819> really

00:03:57.930 --> 00:03:57.940 
from that there's nothing that really

00:03:57.940 --> 00:03:59.040 
from that there's nothing that really
attaches<00:03:58.420> me<00:03:58.540> to<00:03:58.660> the<00:03:58.750> phone

00:03:59.040 --> 00:03:59.050 
attaches me to the phone

00:03:59.050 --> 00:04:01.290 
attaches me to the phone
but<00:03:59.230> the<00:04:00.070> speakers<00:04:00.430> are<00:04:00.520> the<00:04:00.550> only<00:04:00.760> reason<00:04:01.180> I'm

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:01.300 
but the speakers are the only reason I'm

00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:02.910 
but the speakers are the only reason I'm
continuing<00:04:01.930> with<00:04:02.020> this<00:04:02.140> phone<00:04:02.380> I<00:04:02.620> would<00:04:02.740> much

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:02.920 
continuing with this phone I would much

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:04.500 
continuing with this phone I would much
rather<00:04:02.950> have<00:04:03.310> something<00:04:04.180> a<00:04:04.240> little<00:04:04.420> bit

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:04.510 
rather have something a little bit

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:05.730 
rather have something a little bit
bigger<00:04:04.660> I've<00:04:04.990> much<00:04:05.200> rather<00:04:05.380> have<00:04:05.590> someone

00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:05.740 
bigger I've much rather have someone

00:04:05.740 --> 00:04:07.620 
bigger I've much rather have someone
with<00:04:05.890> a<00:04:05.950> better<00:04:06.130> camera<00:04:06.340> but<00:04:07.090> I've<00:04:07.210> stuck<00:04:07.450> with

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:07.630 
with a better camera but I've stuck with

00:04:07.630 --> 00:04:09.630 
with a better camera but I've stuck with
it<00:04:07.750> just<00:04:07.900> because<00:04:08.200> I<00:04:08.410> love<00:04:08.710> listening<00:04:09.490> to

00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:09.640 
it just because I love listening to

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:11.430 
it just because I love listening to
music<00:04:10.000> and<00:04:10.180> it's<00:04:10.630> such<00:04:10.810> an<00:04:10.900> important<00:04:11.320> thing

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:11.440 
music and it's such an important thing

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:13.080 
music and it's such an important thing
for<00:04:11.620> so<00:04:11.800> many<00:04:11.980> people<00:04:12.250> I<00:04:12.490> don't<00:04:12.520> understand

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:13.090 
for so many people I don't understand

00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:15.210 
for so many people I don't understand
why<00:04:13.240> mine<00:04:13.420> factors<00:04:13.840> don't<00:04:13.990> get<00:04:14.230> this<00:04:14.470> I<00:04:14.680> think

00:04:15.210 --> 00:04:15.220 
why mine factors don't get this I think

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:16.830 
why mine factors don't get this I think
that<00:04:15.460> upgrading<00:04:16.000> the<00:04:16.090> speakers<00:04:16.480> won't<00:04:16.660> cost

00:04:16.830 --> 00:04:16.840 
that upgrading the speakers won't cost

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:19.140 
that upgrading the speakers won't cost
them<00:04:17.049> more<00:04:17.230> than<00:04:17.410> sort<00:04:17.680> of<00:04:17.820> 15-20<00:04:18.820> pound<00:04:19.030> you

00:04:19.140 --> 00:04:19.150 
them more than sort of 15-20 pound you

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:20.130 
them more than sort of 15-20 pound you
know<00:04:19.239> I've<00:04:19.299> heard<00:04:19.510> some<00:04:19.720> really<00:04:19.930> really

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:20.140 
know I've heard some really really

00:04:20.140 --> 00:04:22.770 
know I've heard some really really
top-quality<00:04:20.620> 15<00:04:21.280> 20<00:04:21.580> pound<00:04:21.820> Bluetooth

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:22.780 
top-quality 15 20 pound Bluetooth

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:24.510 
top-quality 15 20 pound Bluetooth
speakers<00:04:23.260> and<00:04:23.560> so<00:04:23.740> you<00:04:23.800> know<00:04:24.070> if<00:04:24.190> they<00:04:24.340> can

00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:24.520 
speakers and so you know if they can

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:26.220 
speakers and so you know if they can
just<00:04:25.060> climb<00:04:25.270> that<00:04:25.450> extra<00:04:25.780> bit<00:04:25.900> and<00:04:26.020> make

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:26.230 
just climb that extra bit and make

00:04:26.230 --> 00:04:28.080 
just climb that extra bit and make
something<00:04:26.500> really<00:04:26.590> special<00:04:27.340> then<00:04:27.520> I<00:04:27.730> think

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:28.090 
something really special then I think

00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:30.300 
something really special then I think
loads<00:04:28.330> of<00:04:28.450> people<00:04:28.540> switch<00:04:28.930> over<00:04:29.290> so<00:04:29.530> the<00:04:30.130> next

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:30.310 
loads of people switch over so the next

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:31.440 
loads of people switch over so the next
thing<00:04:30.490> is<00:04:30.610> a<00:04:30.640> little<00:04:30.760> bit<00:04:30.880> different<00:04:31.300> I

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:31.450 
thing is a little bit different I

00:04:31.450 --> 00:04:33.510 
thing is a little bit different I
actually<00:04:32.260> think<00:04:32.680> the<00:04:32.890> LG<00:04:33.220> would<00:04:33.340> really

00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:33.520 
actually think the LG would really

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:35.190 
actually think the LG would really
benefit<00:04:33.970> from<00:04:34.030> thinking<00:04:34.600> outside<00:04:34.780> the<00:04:34.990> box

00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:35.200 
benefit from thinking outside the box

00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:36.750 
benefit from thinking outside the box
little<00:04:35.650> I'm<00:04:35.800> coming<00:04:36.130> up<00:04:36.250> with<00:04:36.280> a<00:04:36.430> really

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:36.760 
little I'm coming up with a really

00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:38.760 
little I'm coming up with a really
unique<00:04:36.790> accessory<00:04:37.720> so<00:04:38.380> you've<00:04:38.470> seen<00:04:38.620> this

00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:38.770 
unique accessory so you've seen this
