00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:27.589

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:29.910 
possible it's possible I mean I think

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:34.280 
possible it's possible I mean I think
we're<00:00:30.119> a<00:00:30.650> obviously<00:00:31.650> a<00:00:31.740> less<00:00:32.899> in<00:00:33.899> some

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:34.290 
we're a obviously a less in some

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:38.930 
we're a obviously a less in some
respects<00:00:34.620> religious<00:00:35.130> culture<00:00:35.579> but<00:00:35.880> I<00:00:35.910> I<00:00:37.940> also

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:38.940 
respects religious culture but I I also

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:41.060 
respects religious culture but I I also
think<00:00:39.360> that<00:00:39.629> it's<00:00:39.960> just<00:00:40.110> simply<00:00:40.680> was<00:00:41.040> a

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.070 
think that it's just simply was a

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:45.110 
think that it's just simply was a
question<00:00:41.610> of<00:00:43.579> Emancipation<00:00:44.579> movements<00:00:45.000> that

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120 
question of Emancipation movements that

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:47.060 
question of Emancipation movements that
took<00:00:45.270> place<00:00:45.390> in<00:00:45.660> the<00:00:45.750> 70s<00:00:46.200> and<00:00:46.469> then<00:00:46.620> I<00:00:46.890> think

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:47.070 
took place in the 70s and then I think

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:54.290 
took place in the 70s and then I think
ultimately<00:00:47.750> it<00:00:48.750> was<00:00:49.370> I<00:00:50.989> don't<00:00:51.989> I<00:00:52.910> don't<00:00:53.910> know

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
ultimately it was I don't I don't know

00:00:54.300 --> 00:01:00.020 
ultimately it was I don't I don't know
when<00:00:55.110> this<00:00:56.539> worm<00:00:57.539> turned<00:00:58.309> really<00:00:59.309> I<00:00:59.640> mean<00:00:59.820> I<00:00:59.879> I

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
when this worm turned really I mean I I

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:03.229 
when this worm turned really I mean I I
really<00:01:01.020> do<00:01:01.170> believe<00:01:01.350> in<00:01:01.800> many<00:01:02.010> respects<00:01:02.460> it

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 
really do believe in many respects it

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:10.359 
really do believe in many respects it
has<00:01:03.420> to<00:01:03.629> do<00:01:03.780> with<00:01:05.960> with<00:01:06.960> TV<00:01:07.380> I<00:01:08.150> just<00:01:09.150> think<00:01:09.630> that

00:01:10.359 --> 00:01:10.369 
has to do with with TV I just think that

00:01:10.369 --> 00:01:14.060 
has to do with with TV I just think that
the<00:01:11.369> younger<00:01:11.760> generation<00:01:12.450> just<00:01:12.770> grew<00:01:13.770> up<00:01:13.799> in

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 
the younger generation just grew up in

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:18.170 
the younger generation just grew up in
an<00:01:14.189> age<00:01:14.479> where<00:01:15.479> you<00:01:16.409> know<00:01:16.850> seeing<00:01:17.850> a<00:01:18.030> gay

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
an age where you know seeing a gay

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:22.640 
an age where you know seeing a gay
person<00:01:18.509> on<00:01:20.330> you<00:01:21.330> know<00:01:21.450> on<00:01:21.810> TV<00:01:22.080> which<00:01:22.409> is<00:01:22.560> the

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650 
person on you know on TV which is the

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:24.490 
person on you know on TV which is the
ultimate<00:01:23.040> validator<00:01:23.490> in<00:01:23.729> our<00:01:23.850> society

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:24.500 
ultimate validator in our society

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:26.870 
ultimate validator in our society
essentially<00:01:25.500> was<00:01:25.710> basically<00:01:26.100> that<00:01:26.310> was<00:01:26.490> it<00:01:26.670> it

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
was just like what's the big deal I mean

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:33.920 
was just like what's the big deal I mean
I<00:01:29.729> can<00:01:29.909> only<00:01:30.000> I<00:01:30.479> mean<00:01:30.869> I<00:01:32.210> obviously<00:01:33.210> I'm<00:01:33.689> just

only<00:02:48.390> imagine<00:02:48.780> the<00:02:51.080> difference<00:02:52.080> between

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:52.230 
only imagine the difference between

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:55.840 
only imagine the difference between
those<00:02:52.470> feelings<00:02:52.920> of<00:02:53.070> complete<00:02:53.490> isolation<00:02:54.830> and

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:55.850 
those feelings of complete isolation and

00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:58.880 
those feelings of complete isolation and
and<00:02:56.850> then<00:02:57.480> it's<00:02:57.690> just<00:02:57.930> sort<00:02:58.110> of<00:02:58.170> cascades<00:02:58.740> from

00:02:58.880 --> 00:02:58.890 
and then it's just sort of cascades from

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:01.100 
and then it's just sort of cascades from
there<00:02:59.190> you<00:02:59.910> you<00:03:00.180> literally<00:03:00.690> you<00:03:00.900> have

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:01.110 
there you you literally you have

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:03.410 
there you you literally you have
generations<00:03:02.010> of<00:03:02.130> people<00:03:02.190> who<00:03:02.610> grow<00:03:02.910> up<00:03:03.120> and

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:03.420 
generations of people who grow up and

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:07.670 
generations of people who grow up and
can<00:03:04.140> out<00:03:04.380> themselves<00:03:05.780> and<00:03:06.780> express<00:03:07.500> who<00:03:07.650> they

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:07.680 
can out themselves and express who they

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:10.970 
can out themselves and express who they
are<00:03:08.660> even<00:03:09.660> if<00:03:09.870> it's<00:03:09.990> just<00:03:10.020> to<00:03:10.260> their<00:03:10.410> family

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:10.980 
are even if it's just to their family

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:13.490 
are even if it's just to their family
when<00:03:11.910> this<00:03:12.390> was<00:03:12.600> a<00:03:12.630> process<00:03:12.930> that<00:03:13.230> they<00:03:13.320> could

00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:13.500 
when this was a process that they could

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:15.080 
when this was a process that they could
not<00:03:13.650> do<00:03:13.860> until<00:03:14.220> they<00:03:14.340> were<00:03:14.430> in<00:03:14.610> their<00:03:14.640> early

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:15.090 
not do until they were in their early

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:18.830 
not do until they were in their early
20s<00:03:15.510> and<00:03:15.690> it<00:03:15.810> moved<00:03:16.080> to<00:03:16.920> a<00:03:17.760> big<00:03:18.270> city<00:03:18.510> where

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:18.840 
20s and it moved to a big city where

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:23.090 
20s and it moved to a big city where
there<00:03:19.020> was<00:03:19.140> a<00:03:19.170> community<00:03:19.590> of<00:03:19.700> of<00:03:21.560> gay<00:03:22.560> people<00:03:22.920> I

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:23.100 
there was a community of of gay people I

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:27.350 
there was a community of of gay people I
mean<00:03:23.250> it<00:03:24.090> I<00:03:24.300> I<00:03:25.110> think<00:03:25.530> it's<00:03:25.770> impossible<00:03:26.360> to

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:27.360 
mean it I I think it's impossible to

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:30.350 
mean it I I think it's impossible to
really<00:03:27.630> sort<00:03:28.200> of<00:03:28.260> fully<00:03:29.160> grasp<00:03:29.730> that<00:03:30.030> and<00:03:30.300> I

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:30.360 
really sort of fully grasp that and I

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:34.220 
really sort of fully grasp that and I
think<00:03:30.420> it<00:03:31.290> must<00:03:31.770> have<00:03:32.010> happened<00:03:33.110> you<00:03:34.110> know

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:34.230 
think it must have happened you know

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:40.750 
think it must have happened you know
sometime<00:03:35.040> I<00:03:36.410> think<00:03:37.410> in<00:03:37.830> the<00:03:37.980> 80s<00:03:38.940> early<00:03:39.930> 90s

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:40.760 
sometime I think in the 80s early 90s

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:43.310 
sometime I think in the 80s early 90s
because<00:03:41.760> you<00:03:42.060> look<00:03:42.270> at<00:03:42.390> the<00:03:42.480> polling<00:03:42.930> in<00:03:43.080> terms

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:43.320 
because you look at the polling in terms

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:45.530 
because you look at the polling in terms
of<00:03:43.500> where<00:03:43.620> kids<00:03:43.890> are<00:03:44.070> and<00:03:44.310> just<00:03:44.550> sort<00:03:44.700> of<00:03:44.760> at

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:45.540 
of where kids are and just sort of at

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:47.180 
of where kids are and just sort of at
one<00:03:45.870> point<00:03:45.900> I<00:03:46.230> hit<00:03:46.380> a<00:03:46.410> critical<00:03:46.560> mass<00:03:46.950> and<00:03:47.160> I

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:47.190 
one point I hit a critical mass and I

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:48.650 
one point I hit a critical mass and I
think<00:03:47.370> that<00:03:47.459> critical<00:03:47.790> mass<00:03:47.910> is<00:03:48.209> basically

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:48.660 
think that critical mass is basically

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:53.030 
think that critical mass is basically
just<00:03:49.590> that<00:03:51.020> you<00:03:52.020> know<00:03:52.110> things<00:03:52.350> like<00:03:52.410> Allen<00:03:52.890> I

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:53.040 
just that you know things like Allen I

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:55.610 
just that you know things like Allen I
mean<00:03:53.510> do<00:03:54.510> you<00:03:54.570> remember<00:03:54.750> I<00:03:54.900> mean<00:03:55.050> I<00:03:55.110> don't<00:03:55.440> know

00:03:55.610 --> 00:03:55.620 
mean do you remember I mean I don't know

00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:59.090 
mean do you remember I mean I don't know
if<00:03:55.680> you<00:03:55.770> guys<00:03:55.950> I<00:03:56.570> remember<00:03:57.570> the<00:03:57.810> the<00:03:58.110> scandal

00:03:59.090 --> 00:03:59.100 
if you guys I remember the the scandal

00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:01.190 
if you guys I remember the the scandal
when<00:03:59.940> Allen<00:04:00.300> kissed<00:04:00.570> the<00:04:00.660> woman<00:04:00.930> I<00:04:00.989> can't

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:01.200 
when Allen kissed the woman I can't

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:04.370 
when Allen kissed the woman I can't
remember<00:04:01.410> who<00:04:01.739> was<00:04:01.950> on<00:04:02.190> on<00:04:02.580> her<00:04:02.700> show<00:04:03.380> there

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:04.380 
remember who was on on her show there

00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:06.050 
remember who was on on her show there
may<00:04:04.530> have<00:04:04.620> been<00:04:04.680> shows<00:04:05.040> that<00:04:05.310> preceded<00:04:05.790> Ellen

00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:06.060 
may have been shows that preceded Ellen

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:08.449 
may have been shows that preceded Ellen
I<00:04:06.150> can't<00:04:06.180> I<00:04:06.690> can't<00:04:07.380> remember<00:04:07.680> but<00:04:07.950> that<00:04:08.010> was

00:04:08.449 --> 00:04:08.459 
I can't I can't remember but that was

00:04:08.459 --> 00:04:15.650 
I can't I can't remember but that was
certainly<00:04:08.910> the<00:04:09.209> most<00:04:09.330> high-profile<00:04:11.480> and<00:04:14.660> you

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:15.660 
certainly the most high-profile and you

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:17.630 
certainly the most high-profile and you
know<00:04:15.780> the<00:04:16.140> the<00:04:16.169> change<00:04:17.070> is<00:04:17.190> just<00:04:17.370> like<00:04:17.459> in<00:04:17.580> the

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:17.640 
know the the change is just like in the

00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:19.670 
know the the change is just like in the
past<00:04:17.790> politically<00:04:18.330> in<00:04:18.450> the<00:04:18.540> past<00:04:18.750> ten<00:04:19.320> years

00:04:19.670 --> 00:04:19.680 
past politically in the past ten years

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:21.170 
past politically in the past ten years
he's<00:04:19.919> been<00:04:20.070> stunning<00:04:20.370> it's<00:04:20.850> been<00:04:21.000> stunning

00:04:21.170 --> 00:04:21.180 
he's been stunning it's been stunning

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:23.029 
he's been stunning it's been stunning
now<00:04:21.600> I<00:04:21.630> think<00:04:21.810> in<00:04:22.169> going<00:04:22.740> back<00:04:22.830> to<00:04:22.890> the

00:04:23.029 --> 00:04:23.039 
now I think in going back to the

00:04:23.039 --> 00:04:24.980 
now I think in going back to the
religious<00:04:23.490> point<00:04:23.760> what's<00:04:24.360> interesting<00:04:24.630> is

00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:24.990 
religious point what's interesting is

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:26.720 
religious point what's interesting is
that<00:04:25.020> in<00:04:25.320> the<00:04:25.470> polls

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:26.730 
that in the polls

00:04:26.730 --> 00:04:30.200 
that in the polls
when<00:04:26.940> it<00:04:27.090> comes<00:04:27.360> to<00:04:27.600> younger<00:04:27.990> people<00:04:28.170> not<00:04:29.210> you

00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:30.210 
when it comes to younger people not you

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:32.150 
when it comes to younger people not you
know<00:04:30.360> you<00:04:31.200> know<00:04:31.260> older<00:04:31.620> people<00:04:31.650> when<00:04:32.040> it<00:04:32.130> comes

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:32.160 
know you know older people when it comes

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:34.280 
know you know older people when it comes
to<00:04:32.400> younger<00:04:32.730> people<00:04:32.850> the<00:04:33.450> religious<00:04:33.930> younger

00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:34.290 
to younger people the religious younger

00:04:34.290 --> 00:04:36.140 
to younger people the religious younger
people<00:04:34.590> are<00:04:34.650> also<00:04:34.920> the<00:04:35.280> exact<00:04:35.670> list<00:04:35.880> is<00:04:36.000> you

00:04:36.140 --> 00:04:36.150 
people are also the exact list is you

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:38.900 
people are also the exact list is you
really<00:04:36.540> significant<00:04:37.290> exactly<00:04:37.860> as<00:04:38.040> if<00:04:38.730> they're

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:38.910 
really significant exactly as if they're

00:04:38.910 --> 00:04:41.570 
really significant exactly as if they're
religiousness<00:04:39.450> is<00:04:39.810> not<00:04:40.020> is<00:04:40.380> not<00:04:41.070> making<00:04:41.490> the

00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:41.580 
religiousness is not is not making the

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:43.160 
religiousness is not is not making the
difference<00:04:41.850> I<00:04:41.880> mean<00:04:41.970> that<00:04:42.150> I<00:04:42.300> really<00:04:42.960> do<00:04:43.050> think

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:43.170 
difference I mean that I really do think

00:04:43.170 --> 00:04:48.080 
difference I mean that I really do think
the<00:04:43.320> difference<00:04:43.620> is<00:04:44.000> age<00:04:45.000> and<00:04:46.730> this<00:04:47.730> is<00:04:47.940> the

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:48.090 
the difference is age and this is the

00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:50.690 
the difference is age and this is the
biggest<00:04:48.360> change<00:04:48.720> that<00:04:48.840> we<00:04:49.020> have<00:04:49.050> seen<00:04:49.430> as<00:04:50.430> far

00:04:50.690 --> 00:04:50.700 
biggest change that we have seen as far

00:04:50.700 --> 00:04:52.130 
biggest change that we have seen as far
as<00:04:50.760> I<00:04:50.970> can<00:04:51.030> tell<00:04:51.210> I<00:04:51.270> mean<00:04:51.450> I<00:04:51.510> haven't<00:04:51.660> done<00:04:51.870> like

00:04:52.130 --> 00:04:52.140 
as I can tell I mean I haven't done like

00:04:52.140 --> 00:04:53.690 
as I can tell I mean I haven't done like
a<00:04:52.170> deep<00:04:52.410> dive<00:04:52.560> into<00:04:52.620> the<00:04:53.010> demographics<00:04:53.610> of

00:04:53.690 --> 00:04:53.700 
a deep dive into the demographics of

00:04:53.700 --> 00:04:55.790 
a deep dive into the demographics of
this<00:04:53.850> but<00:04:54.060> but<00:04:54.240> my<00:04:54.480> sense<00:04:54.840> is<00:04:54.990> is<00:04:55.290> is<00:04:55.590> what

00:04:55.790 --> 00:04:55.800 
this but but my sense is is is what

00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:58.490 
this but but my sense is is is what
Michael<00:04:56.190> just<00:04:56.370> expressed<00:04:57.000> and<00:04:57.420> if<00:04:57.900> it<00:04:58.020> is<00:04:58.200> age

00:04:58.490 --> 00:04:58.500 
Michael just expressed and if it is age

00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:01.810 
Michael just expressed and if it is age
then<00:04:59.340> the<00:04:59.670> question<00:05:00.030> is<00:05:00.180> is<00:05:00.450> what<00:05:00.780> happened

00:05:01.810 --> 00:05:01.820 
then the question is is what happened

00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:05.740 
then the question is is what happened
generationally<00:05:02.820> that<00:05:03.240> became<00:05:03.600> different<00:05:04.110> and

00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:05.750 
generationally that became different and

00:05:05.750 --> 00:05:08.900 
generationally that became different and
that<00:05:06.750> would<00:05:06.900> have<00:05:07.050> such<00:05:07.320> a<00:05:07.470> broad<00:05:08.190> impact<00:05:08.490> and

00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:08.910 
that would have such a broad impact and

00:05:08.910 --> 00:05:14.780 
that would have such a broad impact and
I<00:05:08.970> really<00:05:09.450> do<00:05:09.510> that<00:05:09.660> I<00:05:09.720> think<00:05:09.780> was<00:05:09.960> TV<00:05:10.880> I<00:05:13.790> think

00:05:14.780 --> 00:05:14.790 
I really do that I think was TV I think

00:05:14.790 --> 00:05:17.270 
I really do that I think was TV I think
it<00:05:14.880> was<00:05:14.970> TV
