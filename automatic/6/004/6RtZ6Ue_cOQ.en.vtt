00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:31.450
 the tazos 

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:39.950
 little has been said about the origin of 

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:42.800
 the tazos but there are those who claim that 

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:48.640
 Tazos are the product of a game 

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:51.530
 17th century Japanese men called with 

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:55.040
 many rules of the game were totally 

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:57.500
 identical to that of the tazos the 

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:59.750
 opponent threw his card against

 that of the other participant in such a way 

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:05.270
 that will manage to flip the letter if you do not 

00:02:02.869 --> 00:02:07.729
 It was giving way to the other's turn 

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:10.670
 participant and so on until 

00:02:07.729 --> 00:02:13.450
