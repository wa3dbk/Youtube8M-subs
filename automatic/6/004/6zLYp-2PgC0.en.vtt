 doubts that we need to have oil 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:36.809
 of olive in necessary quantity here 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:39.239
 I have salt that are not our technicians 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:41.879
 it's not all that we need 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:44.309
 here I have half an onion 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:46.469
 of rough cut mode that will be for 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:49.440
 our marinade that is practically going to be 

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:52.230
 of pure dried chiles are still here I have 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:54.750

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:56.789
 mirasol about three small chilies for 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:59.789
 chair and it is the spicy touch that is going to 

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:02.399
 give our chilitos de árbol 5 are 

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:05.379
 enough we're going to fall in love with what is 

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:09.189
 a sack of spices made up of 

00:01:05.379 --> 00:01:11.860
 love the clove oregano cumin 

00:01:09.189 --> 00:01:14.140
 whole here I have three cloves of garlic 

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:16.600
 that are observed well do not fight them like this 

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:19.179
 it's enough for that scent 

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:22.899
 characteristic a herbaceous touch of 

00:01:19.179 --> 00:01:25.960
 cilantro and half an onion that 

00:01:22.899 --> 00:01:27.729
 if they realize it is totally burned 

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:30.310
 in gastronomic terms you are 

00:01:27.729 --> 00:01:33.270
 known as òmnium brulé on the subject 

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:37.270
 it's that easy to give a good smoky flavor 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:40.270
 aromatic as they have no idea and our 

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:43.509
 meat for our bible meat for that 

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:45.849
 so easy and a half kilo is enough 

00:01:43.509 --> 00:01:48.610
 let's start what we do first is 

00:01:45.849 --> 00:01:50.500
 put together our sack of spices here in 

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:54.789
 our onion what we are going to do is 

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:57.069
 embed our cloves because 

00:01:54.789 --> 00:01:58.659
 it is important to embed them so that the 

00:01:57.069 --> 00:02:00.490
 moment they are in our bag of 

00:01:58.659 --> 00:02:03.189
 spices there in the boiling water with 

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:06.310
 our ingredients these are not the 

00:02:03.189 --> 00:02:09.850
 break guys come out to avoid that 

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:12.400
 let's embed the now that easy 

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:15.849
 let's put it well 

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:18.310
 our onion here in a telita can 

00:02:15.849 --> 00:02:21.370
 be a blanket of heaven and so on what 

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:25.959
 you want and we are going to add everything 

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:28.430
 what is the laurel this the cumin the 

00:02:25.959 --> 00:02:33.799
 oregano the garlic 

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:35.390
 and that's how easy it is to close it 

00:02:33.799 --> 00:02:38.510
 let's make our bag of 

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:40.190
 spices here in is reissued we're going to 

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:43.700
 turn 

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:45.790
 Oh, it's perfect and we're going to tie it 

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:48.800
 in a pot with boiling water 

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:53.680
 approximately 5 liters we are going to 

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:57.700
 put more or less a good salt 

00:02:53.680 --> 00:03:01.180
 there it is fine and our sack of spices 

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:05.920
 guys, look what we just put together there 

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:09.519
 is there and we are going to place our meat 

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:12.420
 to plant like that, we're going to 

00:03:09.519 --> 00:03:14.950
 place and we're going to leave it 

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:17.500
 about an hour and a half to two hours 

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:21.280
 guys go out for our marinade in a 

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:24.700
 hot pan over medium heat let's go to 

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:28.829
 add a touch of oil so that 

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:33.700
 then we begin to soften our 

00:03:28.829 --> 00:03:35.919
 onion and that 's fine that's why it makes us 

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:37.930
 So much effort to make beautiful cuts 

00:03:35.919 --> 00:03:40.599
 because because that bad and when nothing else 

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:43.959
 is to act of these faces come out 

00:03:40.599 --> 00:03:48.370
 now we softened our onion 

00:03:43.959 --> 00:03:50.680
 to add our dried chiles 

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:53.640
 in other bus recipes what they do 

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:56.110
 is that they are hills in water first 

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:59.110
 rehydrate them this is a way 

00:03:56.110 --> 00:04:01.870
 different but equally rich will see 

00:03:59.110 --> 00:04:04.510
 what we are going to do is give you some 

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:08.650
 strong dating nothing more to feel at 

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:11.860
 drop their aromas presence these guys 

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:14.980
 dry that are automated with the onion 

00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:18.220
 but let's do it just question 

00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:20.769
 one minute that because it is very 

00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:23.310
 delicate our dry chile after 

00:04:20.769 --> 00:04:26.300
 it burns us nothing else we're going to do that 

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:31.190
 enhance the aromas 

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:34.240
 now for now yes rehydrate them the 

00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:38.620
 same bottom where it's cooking 

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:38.620
 our flesh like him 

00:04:43.969 --> 00:04:50.029
 and it was not necessary to put a touch 

00:04:46.879 --> 00:04:52.579
 of salt put something to put another type of 

00:04:50.029 --> 00:04:55.849
 touch as herbaceous because because in 

00:04:52.579 --> 00:04:58.099
 our case is totally seasoned if 

00:04:55.849 --> 00:05:02.409
 you like 2-3 garlic cloves more 

00:04:58.099 --> 00:05:02.409
 how much we are going to continue 

00:05:08.510 --> 00:05:15.040
 our chillies ready, what follows is 

00:05:11.540 --> 00:05:15.040
 liquefy the guys for our 

00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:31.050
 already ready our meat what we are going to 

00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:35.810
 to do is remove it from the bottom and start 

00:05:31.050 --> 00:05:35.810
 crumble it and we continue with the recipe 

00:05:42.430 --> 00:05:48.970
 already crumbled our meat and ice cream 

00:05:46.180 --> 00:05:52.300
 previously cast what we are going to do 

00:05:48.970 --> 00:05:54.490
 is to remove the entourage of spices from 

00:05:52.300 --> 00:05:56.830
 our fund in the course of 

00:05:54.490 --> 00:05:58.870
 time that is cooking our 

00:05:56.830 --> 00:06:02.680
 meat is going to start consuming a little 

00:05:58.870 --> 00:06:05.200
 of water what you have to do is nothing 

00:06:02.680 --> 00:06:07.150
 more add more water during the process 

00:06:05.200 --> 00:06:10.420
 all the concentrates of the 

00:06:07.150 --> 00:06:13.550
 ingredients here are going to stay now 

00:06:10.420 --> 00:06:16.110
 what we are going to add 

00:06:13.550 --> 00:06:21.390
 to our fund 

00:06:16.110 --> 00:06:25.680
 our shredded meat there is very 

00:06:21.390 --> 00:06:29.310
 good and now 

00:06:25.680 --> 00:06:32.400
 and the marinade, as I repeat , had to 

00:06:29.310 --> 00:06:35.870
 strain to remove in your waste from the 

00:06:32.400 --> 00:06:41.060
 dried chilli husks 

00:06:35.870 --> 00:06:44.870
 to it is very good and a broad secret 

00:06:41.060 --> 00:06:47.210
 they listened well to a can of beer he 

00:06:44.870 --> 00:06:51.620
 answer nothing else 

00:06:47.210 --> 00:06:53.710
 all without fear but from no pain 

00:06:51.620 --> 00:06:56.350
 go out 

00:06:53.710 --> 00:07:00.400
 and we are going to remove a little so that 

00:06:56.350 --> 00:07:04.090
 see how it's going to take a little bit of color 

00:07:00.400 --> 00:07:06.100
 check and let's let it boil 

00:07:04.090 --> 00:07:08.530
 I know that they concentrate again 

00:07:06.100 --> 00:07:11.320
 mention our ingredients and 

00:07:08.530 --> 00:07:14.670
 about half an hour with that is 

00:07:11.320 --> 00:07:14.670
 more than enough 

00:07:26.409 --> 00:07:29.129
 good 

00:07:38.120 --> 00:07:42.830
 what do you think of this way of preparing 

00:07:40.220 --> 00:07:45.139
 a very universal recipe of 

00:07:42.830 --> 00:07:48.380
 Mexican gastronomy where you know all 

00:07:45.139 --> 00:07:50.540
 the republic as the south in the west 

00:07:48.380 --> 00:07:53.330
 He managed to get away with another technician and a challenge 

00:07:50.540 --> 00:07:55.220
 deduction totally different but it's 

00:07:53.330 --> 00:07:58.280
 the way we no longer prepare it for you 

00:07:55.220 --> 00:07:59.930
 I hope you liked guys do not 

00:07:58.280 --> 00:08:02.720

00:07:59.930 --> 00:08:04.550
 everything maybe they are already remember some doubt 

00:08:02.720 --> 00:08:06.380
