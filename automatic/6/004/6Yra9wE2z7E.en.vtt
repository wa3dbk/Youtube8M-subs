yeah they do almost look kind of like
shell<00:01:52.770> cordovan<00:01:53.159> although<00:01:53.520> I<00:01:53.549> imagine<00:01:53.729> when

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:54.240 
shell cordovan although I imagine when

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:56.270 
shell cordovan although I imagine when
these<00:01:54.360> break<00:01:54.659> in<00:01:54.950> you<00:01:55.950> know<00:01:56.040> they're<00:01:56.189> not

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:56.280 
these break in you know they're not

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:59.030 
these break in you know they're not
gonna<00:01:56.460> look<00:01:56.869> as<00:01:57.869> much<00:01:58.200> like<00:01:58.259> shell<00:01:58.649> cordovan

00:01:59.030 --> 00:01:59.040 
gonna look as much like shell cordovan

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:00.469 
gonna look as much like shell cordovan
because<00:01:59.340> they're<00:01:59.490> going<00:01:59.670> to<00:01:59.790> develop<00:01:59.909> you

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:00.479 
because they're going to develop you

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:03.230 
because they're going to develop you
know<00:02:00.600> the<00:02:01.310> different<00:02:02.310> kinds<00:02:02.579> of<00:02:02.700> cracks<00:02:03.030> and

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:03.240 
know the different kinds of cracks and

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:04.940 
know the different kinds of cracks and
folds<00:02:03.659> not<00:02:03.810> really<00:02:03.990> cracks<00:02:04.229> but<00:02:04.439> folds<00:02:04.829> and

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:04.950 
folds not really cracks but folds and

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:08.900 
folds not really cracks but folds and
stuff<00:02:05.390> that<00:02:06.390> normal<00:02:06.840> leather<00:02:07.049> get<00:02:07.910> rather

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:08.910 
stuff that normal leather get rather

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:12.080 
stuff that normal leather get rather
than<00:02:09.149> the<00:02:09.300> shell<00:02:09.450> cordovan<00:02:09.869> smoothness<00:02:11.060> but<00:02:12.060> I

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:12.090 
than the shell cordovan smoothness but I

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:12.949 
than the shell cordovan smoothness but I
think<00:02:12.330> these<00:02:12.390> are<00:02:12.480> going<00:02:12.599> to<00:02:12.660> be<00:02:12.750> very

00:02:12.949 --> 00:02:12.959 
think these are going to be very

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:13.580 
think these are going to be very
hard-wearing

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:13.590 
hard-wearing

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:17.869 
hard-wearing

no<00:03:00.900> contrast<00:03:01.470> stitching<00:03:01.739> as<00:03:02.010> you<00:03:02.160> saw<00:03:03.000> so<00:03:03.510> you

00:03:03.559 --> 00:03:03.569 
no contrast stitching as you saw so you

00:03:03.569 --> 00:03:05.089 
no contrast stitching as you saw so you
know<00:03:03.780> the<00:03:03.989> normal<00:03:04.170> any<00:03:04.410> boot<00:03:04.620> has<00:03:04.829> white

00:03:05.089 --> 00:03:05.099 
know the normal any boot has white

00:03:05.099 --> 00:03:07.910 
know the normal any boot has white
stitching<00:03:05.670> this<00:03:06.150> has<00:03:06.360> the<00:03:06.510> brown<00:03:06.690> also<00:03:07.560> has<00:03:07.709> a

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:07.920 
stitching this has the brown also has a

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:09.589 
stitching this has the brown also has a
slim<00:03:08.400> welt

00:03:09.589 --> 00:03:09.599 
slim welt

00:03:09.599 --> 00:03:14.270 
slim welt
so<00:03:10.110> the<00:03:10.980> welt<00:03:11.220> is<00:03:12.500> and<00:03:13.500> also<00:03:13.799> the<00:03:13.920> welt<00:03:14.069> is<00:03:14.250> a

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:14.280 
so the welt is and also the welt is a

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:16.460 
so the welt is and also the welt is a
sort<00:03:15.150> of<00:03:15.239> the<00:03:15.329> color<00:03:15.540> of<00:03:15.660> the<00:03:15.900> shoes<00:03:16.140> as<00:03:16.319> well

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:16.470 
sort of the color of the shoes as well

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:19.069 
sort of the color of the shoes as well
so<00:03:16.739> it<00:03:17.340> makes<00:03:17.609> for<00:03:17.700> a<00:03:17.850> pretty<00:03:18.030> good<00:03:18.299> package<00:03:18.750> in

00:03:19.069 --> 00:03:19.079 
so it makes for a pretty good package in

00:03:19.079 --> 00:03:21.370 
so it makes for a pretty good package in
terms<00:03:19.380> of<00:03:19.650> the<00:03:20.459> way<00:03:20.549> they<00:03:20.880> look

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:21.380 
terms of the way they look

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:26.240 
terms of the way they look
the<00:03:23.239> she<00:03:24.239> was<00:03:24.329> very<00:03:24.510> comfortable<00:03:24.959> as<00:03:25.260> you<00:03:26.100> know

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:26.250 
the she was very comfortable as you know

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:28.220 
the she was very comfortable as you know

way back here the stitching it just goes
to<00:04:01.769> there<00:04:01.919> so<00:04:02.069> it<00:04:02.130> doesn't<00:04:02.250> go<00:04:02.370> all<00:04:02.489> the<00:04:02.609> way

00:04:02.629 --> 00:04:02.639 
to there so it doesn't go all the way

00:04:02.639 --> 00:04:07.610 
to there so it doesn't go all the way
around<00:04:02.849> the<00:04:03.000> shoe<00:04:03.470> and<00:04:04.470> again<00:04:06.440> you<00:04:07.440> know<00:04:07.530> it's

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:07.620 
around the shoe and again you know it's

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:10.039 
around the shoe and again you know it's
a<00:04:07.650> bit<00:04:07.829> unique<00:04:08.040> for<00:04:08.430> indie<00:04:08.609> boots<00:04:08.790> because<00:04:09.480> you

00:04:10.049 --> 00:04:13.970 
a bit unique for indie boots because you
