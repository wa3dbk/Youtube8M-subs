00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:54.500 
series although I have to admit the
captain<00:00:53.430> from<00:00:53.550> Wally's<00:00:53.910> a<00:00:53.940> little<00:00:54.270> weak<00:00:54.480> but

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
captain from Wally's a little weak but

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:56.959 
captain from Wally's a little weak but
they've<00:00:54.840> already<00:00:54.989> done<00:00:55.170> wall-e<00:00:55.590> and<00:00:55.980> Eve<00:00:56.070> in<00:00:56.699> a

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
they've already done wall-e and Eve in a

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:59.750 
they've already done wall-e and Eve in a
special<00:00:57.329> limited<00:00:57.690> set<00:00:57.960> so<00:00:58.920> he's<00:00:59.190> probably<00:00:59.430> the

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
special limited set so he's probably the

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:01.970 
special limited set so he's probably the
only<00:00:59.910> other<00:01:00.059> character<00:01:00.390> they<00:01:00.510> could<00:01:00.690> do<00:01:00.840> and<00:01:01.199> I

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
only other character they could do and I

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:05.780 
only other character they could do and I
think<00:01:02.850> this<00:01:03.420> is<00:01:03.750> the<00:01:04.339> can't<00:01:05.339> even<00:01:05.549> think<00:01:05.670> of

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:05.790 
think this is the can't even think of

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:08.120 
think this is the can't even think of
his<00:01:05.909> name<00:01:06.080> that's<00:01:07.080> the<00:01:07.350> character<00:01:07.770> from<00:01:07.860> Bowl

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
his name that's the character from Bowl

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:11.390 
his name that's the character from Bowl
the<00:01:08.549> hamster<00:01:09.270> RINO<00:01:09.630> I<00:01:09.960> think<00:01:10.920> that's<00:01:11.100> who<00:01:11.250> that

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
the hamster RINO I think that's who that

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:14.870 
the hamster RINO I think that's who that
is<00:01:11.930> all<00:01:12.930> the<00:01:13.049> other<00:01:13.170> I<00:01:13.500> like<00:01:14.340> all<00:01:14.549> these<00:01:14.729> so
