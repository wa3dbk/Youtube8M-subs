 good hands you washed your hand 

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:19.610
 disgusting 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:24.539
 the ingredients that we're going to be 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:27.180
 using to make these worms these 

00:01:24.539 --> 00:01:30.270
 Gelatin worms are going to be two 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:32.340
 raspberry jelly packs each 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:34.530
 one of these packages have 40 grams or 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:36.119
 we are going to need 80 grams of 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:38.039
 raspberry jelly 

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:40.679
 we are going to need one more package but 

00:01:38.039 --> 00:01:42.659
 unflavored gelatin that would be 40 grams 

00:01:40.679 --> 00:01:44.659
 more that we can also use a bit of 

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:48.149
 sugar about 2 tablespoons sugar 

00:01:44.659 --> 00:01:50.750
 34 cups of cream common milk cream 

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:53.069
 we will also use these pages 

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:54.990
 enough the most can get or 

00:01:53.069 --> 00:01:57.000
 if not passed in the container they have 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:58.649
 good they will use more or less in this 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.240
 I'm going to use this container 

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:02.310
 what are the straws have to be 

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:05.849
 these flexible and what we're going to do 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:07.500
 is to stretch society come like this but 

00:02:05.849 --> 00:02:09.890
 we have to stretch them for 

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:12.209
 that are stretched in this way 

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:14.760
 You can also use the common ones I ended up 

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:16.620
 to mix also with commons because not 

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:19.049
 I got the necessary amount of this 

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:20.190
 I had some I bought some and I 

00:02:19.049 --> 00:02:21.810
 they were also from these pages 

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:24.480
 common we will need also 

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:26.850
 food coloring green color of this 

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:27.870
 we are going to need about 15 drops we are going to 

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:30.420
 see a lot of people too 

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:33.150
 tall and narrow container while more 

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:34.980
 narrower and higher is longer 

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:36.840
 to get them to be the worms and going to 

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:38.970
 show also boiling water that would be 

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:40.830
 to prepare the gelatin first let's go 

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:42.629
 to work with the cream we will have 

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:44.640
 to put the fourth cup of cream 

00:02:42.629 --> 00:02:46.950
 milk in a bowl and let's put 

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:47.970
 two tablespoons of sugar then we go to 

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:49.709
 have to start stirring 

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:51.840
 approximately for eight minutes 

00:02:49.709 --> 00:02:53.730
 until it starts to thicken it can be 

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:56.730
 more can be less always having 

00:02:53.730 --> 00:03:00.410
 be careful that we do not miss 

00:02:56.730 --> 00:03:00.410
 [Music] 

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:10.819
 [Music] 

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:10.819
 and 

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:15.690
 ah 

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:17.730
 then we will take three cups of water 

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:19.650
 boiling and we're going to dissolve the two 

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:21.630
 packages of raspberry jelly and the 

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:23.160
 unflavored gelatin pack this 

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:25.170
 we have to stir well until it 

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:27.209
 Dissolve all gelatins once 

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:28.800
 this is already warm do not have to leave it 

00:03:27.209 --> 00:03:31.080
 cool but you do not have to be 

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:32.819
 boiling let's put this this that 

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:34.800
 we did it would be a kind of burning djs 

00:03:32.819 --> 00:03:36.270
 I did not say it but it would be like cream 

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:44.069
 chantilly and we're going to mix it here 

00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:48.950
 inside and finally we're going to add some 

00:03:44.069 --> 00:03:48.950
 15 drops of green food coloring 

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:59.560
 and now we go with the next feat 

00:03:56.980 --> 00:04:01.630
 what is to put this inside our 

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:03.670
 narrow and long container while more 

00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:06.040
 narrow and long better and then to have 

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:07.900
 to go putting all the straws that the 

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:09.550
 flexible part is down and 

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:11.110
 remember that you have to stretch them and 

00:04:09.550 --> 00:04:13.210
 in creating as straight as possible well 

00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:15.120
 stretched because all the liquid has 

00:04:13.210 --> 00:04:22.850
 to enter if there is not going to be air 

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:25.140
 [Music] 

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:26.670
 and now to finish with this we're going 

00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:28.440
 to put on the slope or in the freezer 

00:04:26.670 --> 00:04:30.300
 until it takes consistency until it 

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:32.160
 cool you are going to ask how long 

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:35.560
 well that will depend on each refrigerator 

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:37.990
 or from each freezer 

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:39.490
 and once it has cooled down what 

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:41.500
 only thing left now to do to 

00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:43.570
 to end up producing us is to take one for 

00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:45.760
 one each of the straws we are going to 

00:04:43.570 --> 00:04:48.020
 take this and what we have to do is 

00:04:45.760 --> 00:05:09.580
 start squeezing in this way 

00:04:48.020 --> 00:05:09.690
 [Music] 

00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:15.779
 [Applause] 

00:05:09.690 --> 00:05:15.779

00:05:17.430 --> 00:05:23.050
 and if you want to see more videos like these 

00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:24.240
 well on the whole page of one 

00:05:23.050 --> 00:05:27.350
