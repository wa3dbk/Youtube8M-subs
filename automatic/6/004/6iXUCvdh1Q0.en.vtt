the<00:01:21.509> Daegu<00:01:21.810> mini<00:01:22.020> driver<00:01:22.200> was<00:01:22.500> the<00:01:22.590> obvious

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
the Daegu mini driver was the obvious

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:24.410 
the Daegu mini driver was the obvious
choice<00:01:22.950> of<00:01:23.280> the<00:01:23.400> brain<00:01:23.580> for<00:01:23.759> the<00:01:23.850> robot<00:01:24.150> as<00:01:24.270> it

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420 
choice of the brain for the robot as it

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:26.810 
choice of the brain for the robot as it
was<00:01:24.509> quite<00:01:24.750> small<00:01:24.930> and<00:01:25.290> it<00:01:25.680> also<00:01:25.799> had<00:01:26.070> handy

was quite small and it also had handy
male<00:01:27.030> headers<00:01:27.360> so<00:01:27.720> I<00:01:27.750> can<00:01:27.990> plug<00:01:28.170> in<00:01:28.320> the<00:01:28.650> female

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070

servo a form factor but they are in fact
DC<00:01:42.180> motors<00:01:42.479> so<00:01:42.899> again<00:01:43.110> I<00:01:43.200> chose<00:01:43.409> these<00:01:43.619> because

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:43.680 
DC motors so again I chose these because

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:47.450 
DC motors so again I chose these because
of<00:01:44.009> their<00:01:44.220> form<00:01:44.490> factor<00:01:44.909> the<00:01:46.369> programming<00:01:47.369> of

of their form factor the programming of

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:48.770 
of their form factor the programming of
pet<00:01:47.640> is<00:01:47.759> actually<00:01:48.090> quite<00:01:48.299> simple

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780 
pet is actually quite simple

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:50.240 
pet is actually quite simple
when<00:01:49.170> you<00:01:49.259> first<00:01:49.439> turn<00:01:49.649> ur<00:01:49.710> on<00:01:49.920> there<00:01:50.130> is<00:01:50.220> a

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:55.170 
environment is like this is this

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:56.749

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:07.350 
detect there's anyone around she will

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:09.350 
detect there's anyone around she will
actually<00:02:07.500> go<00:02:07.740> into<00:02:07.770> curiosity<00:02:08.160> mode<00:02:08.759> and<00:02:09.239> what

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:09.360 
actually go into curiosity mode and what

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:10.580 
actually go into curiosity mode and what
this<00:02:09.509> means<00:02:09.690> is<00:02:09.929> she'll<00:02:10.110> actually<00:02:10.229> go<00:02:10.470> into

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:10.590 
this means is she'll actually go into

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:12.350 
this means is she'll actually go into
obstacle<00:02:11.009> of<00:02:11.039> warning<00:02:11.310> mode<00:02:11.489> and<00:02:11.670> search<00:02:12.150> out

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:20.360 
comfortable and she feels okay however
if<00:02:18.750> in<00:02:19.140> this<00:02:19.290> first<00:02:19.530> bit<00:02:19.709> up<00:02:19.830> sequence<00:02:20.099> that

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:20.370 
if in this first bit up sequence that

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:22.550 
if in this first bit up sequence that
there<00:02:20.670> is<00:02:20.790> a<00:02:20.819> quite<00:02:21.300> a<00:02:21.330> large<00:02:21.959> amount<00:02:22.050> of<00:02:22.319> noise

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:22.560 
there is a quite a large amount of noise

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:24.680 
there is a quite a large amount of noise
she'll<00:02:23.400> actually<00:02:23.550> go<00:02:23.790> into<00:02:24.000> dark<00:02:24.239> seeking

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:24.690 
she'll actually go into dark seeking

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:26.150 
she'll actually go into dark seeking
mode<00:02:24.840> and<00:02:25.020> this<00:02:25.110> is<00:02:25.260> to<00:02:25.410> simulate<00:02:25.620> her<00:02:25.920> being

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:26.160 
mode and this is to simulate her being

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:27.770 
mode and this is to simulate her being
scared<00:02:26.520> and<00:02:26.640> wanting<00:02:27.000> to<00:02:27.030> find<00:02:27.360> the<00:02:27.450> darkest

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:27.780 
scared and wanting to find the darkest

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:30.199 
scared and wanting to find the darkest
spot<00:02:27.989> available<00:02:28.470> and<00:02:28.650> as<00:02:29.220> you<00:02:29.400> can<00:02:29.550> see<00:02:29.819> this

00:02:30.199 --> 00:02:30.209 
spot available and as you can see this

00:02:30.209 --> 00:02:32.990 
spot available and as you can see this
also<00:02:30.510> means<00:02:30.989> that<00:02:31.290> she'll<00:02:31.530> take<00:02:32.220> on<00:02:32.430> shelter

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:33.000 
also means that she'll take on shelter

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:34.910 
also means that she'll take on shelter
so<00:02:33.390> if<00:02:33.510> I<00:02:33.630> place<00:02:33.930> my<00:02:34.140> hand<00:02:34.410> over<00:02:34.590> her<00:02:34.890> to

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:34.920 
so if I place my hand over her to

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:37.009 
so if I place my hand over her to
provide<00:02:35.730> a<00:02:35.760> form<00:02:36.090> of<00:02:36.239> shelter<00:02:36.510> or<00:02:36.959> protection

00:02:37.009 --> 00:02:37.019 
provide a form of shelter or protection

00:02:37.019 --> 00:02:39.710 
provide a form of shelter or protection
she'll<00:02:37.800> take<00:02:38.040> that<00:02:38.280> and<00:02:38.430> she'll<00:02:38.640> most<00:02:39.120> most

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:39.720 
she'll take that and she'll most most

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:41.920 
she'll take that and she'll most most
usually<00:02:40.140> want<00:02:40.349> to<00:02:40.410> stay<00:02:40.560> underneath<00:02:41.010> my<00:02:41.250> hand

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:41.930 
usually want to stay underneath my hand

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:45.050 
usually want to stay underneath my hand
she'll<00:02:42.930> keep<00:02:43.140> doing<00:02:43.440> the<00:02:43.739> specific<00:02:44.700> routine

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:45.060 
she'll keep doing the specific routine

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:47.150 
she'll keep doing the specific routine
for<00:02:45.300> a<00:02:45.360> certain<00:02:45.630> amount<00:02:45.720> of<00:02:45.900> time<00:02:46.170> again<00:02:46.890> most

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:47.160 
for a certain amount of time again most

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:50.059 
for a certain amount of time again most
of<00:02:47.310> these<00:02:47.400> are<00:02:47.610> random<00:02:48.440> she<00:02:49.440> will<00:02:49.620> go<00:02:49.799> around

00:02:50.059 --> 00:02:50.069 
of these are random she will go around

00:02:50.069 --> 00:02:52.460 
of these are random she will go around
she'll<00:02:50.700> stop<00:02:51.000> again<00:02:51.299> and<00:02:51.450> then<00:02:52.049> she'll<00:02:52.260> listen

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:52.470 
she'll stop again and then she'll listen

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:54.559 
she'll stop again and then she'll listen
again<00:02:52.830> to<00:02:52.890> check<00:02:53.190> check<00:02:53.880> our<00:02:54.030> environment<00:02:54.480> and

again to check check our environment and
she'll<00:02:54.750> keep<00:02:54.959> doing<00:02:55.230> this<00:02:55.350> if<00:02:56.100> you'd<00:02:57.000> like<00:02:57.180> to

00:02:57.320 --> 00:02:57.330 
she'll keep doing this if you'd like to
