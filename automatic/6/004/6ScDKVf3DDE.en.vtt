take off the cover you can see when I
pick<00:00:09.090> up<00:00:09.240> the<00:00:09.360> pattern<00:00:09.809> how<00:00:10.380> detailed<00:00:10.740> it<00:00:11.160> is

00:00:11.270 --> 00:00:11.280 
pick up the pattern how detailed it is

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:13.100 
pick up the pattern how detailed it is
you<00:00:11.460> have<00:00:11.639> a<00:00:11.670> woman<00:00:12.090> leaning<00:00:12.540> up<00:00:12.660> against<00:00:13.049> the

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:27.000 
trees flowing all around and then

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:28.759 
trees flowing all around and then
another<00:00:27.359> pattern<00:00:27.689> that<00:00:27.869> starts<00:00:28.349> up<00:00:28.500> here

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:28.769 
another pattern that starts up here

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:31.040 
another pattern that starts up here
around<00:00:29.070> the<00:00:29.250> border<00:00:29.670> with<00:00:30.179> flowers<00:00:30.720> and<00:00:30.929> like

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:31.050 
around the border with flowers and like

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:33.440 
around the border with flowers and like
a<00:00:31.080> horn<00:00:31.439> of<00:00:31.560> plenty<00:00:31.740> with<00:00:32.309> leaf<00:00:32.610> patterns<00:00:33.270> in

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:33.450 
a horn of plenty with leaf patterns in

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:35.630 
a horn of plenty with leaf patterns in
it<00:00:33.540> and<00:00:33.750> then<00:00:34.140> again<00:00:34.469> you<00:00:34.680> see<00:00:34.710> another<00:00:35.160> border

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640 
it and then again you see another border

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:38.060 
it and then again you see another border
with<00:00:36.090> more<00:00:36.329> flowers<00:00:36.809> and<00:00:36.840> more<00:00:37.170> pattern<00:00:37.590> so

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:38.070 
with more flowers and more pattern so

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:39.920 
with more flowers and more pattern so
you<00:00:38.160> can<00:00:38.399> see<00:00:38.610> the<00:00:38.760> detail<00:00:39.210> that's<00:00:39.450> added<00:00:39.780> in

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930 
you can see the detail that's added in

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:42.979 
you can see the detail that's added in
here<00:00:40.200> with<00:00:40.469> more<00:00:40.739> detail<00:00:41.129> here<00:00:41.489> and<00:00:41.700> on<00:00:42.180> the<00:00:42.450> on

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:42.989 
here with more detail here and on the on

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:44.869 
here with more detail here and on the on
the<00:00:43.260> spouts<00:00:43.860> you<00:00:44.040> can<00:00:44.190> see<00:00:44.340> the<00:00:44.460> floral

00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:44.879 
the spouts you can see the floral

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:46.940 
the spouts you can see the floral
pattern<00:00:45.090> that<00:00:45.420> runs<00:00:45.600> up<00:00:45.870> the<00:00:45.899> spout<00:00:46.289> and<00:00:46.860> you

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950 
pattern that runs up the spout and you

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:49.010 
pattern that runs up the spout and you
usually<00:00:47.340> will<00:00:47.730> see<00:00:47.910> some<00:00:48.149> detail<00:00:48.180> on<00:00:48.780> the

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.020 
usually will see some detail on the

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:52.189 
usually will see some detail on the
handle<00:00:49.770> of<00:00:49.890> the<00:00:49.950> teapot<00:00:50.430> too<00:00:50.730> so<00:00:51.300> this<00:00:51.539> this<00:00:51.960> is

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199 
handle of the teapot too so this this is

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:54.229 
handle of the teapot too so this this is
a<00:00:52.230> really<00:00:52.770> intricate<00:00:53.100> patterns<00:00:53.820> very

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239 
a really intricate patterns very

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:57.170 
a really intricate patterns very
detailed<00:00:54.780> and<00:00:55.350> very<00:00:55.590> deep<00:00:56.010> blue<00:00:56.579> but<00:00:56.910> you<00:00:57.000> can

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 
detailed and very deep blue but you can

detailed and very deep blue but you can
also<00:00:57.360> see<00:00:57.660> how<00:00:57.780> crisp<00:00:58.230> the<00:00:58.469> pattern<00:00:58.829> is<00:00:58.949> you

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
also see how crisp the pattern is you

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:01.130 
also see how crisp the pattern is you
can<00:00:59.250> see<00:00:59.460> the<00:00:59.609> event<00:00:59.850> actually<00:01:00.420> you<00:01:00.989> can

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
can see the event actually you can

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:03.410 
can see the event actually you can
almost<00:01:01.289> it<00:01:01.800> almost<00:01:02.070> step<00:01:02.489> into<00:01:02.820> there<00:01:02.969> and<00:01:03.239> and

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
almost it almost step into there and and

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:05.479 
almost it almost step into there and and

some other examples here here's one with
the<00:01:23.520> birds<00:01:25.490> picking<00:01:26.490> at<00:01:26.790> the<00:01:27.350> seeds<00:01:28.549> on<00:01:29.549> the

00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:29.759 
the birds picking at the seeds on the

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:32.060 
the birds picking at the seeds on the
end<00:01:29.909> of<00:01:30.060> the<00:01:30.150> flower<00:01:30.479> there's<00:01:30.960> some<00:01:31.350> you<00:01:31.890> can

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
end of the flower there's some you can

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:33.950 
end of the flower there's some you can
see<00:01:32.220> the<00:01:32.340> detail<00:01:32.700> of<00:01:32.729> the<00:01:33.000> stems<00:01:33.360> with<00:01:33.630> a<00:01:33.659> very

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960 
see the detail of the stems with a very

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:35.899 
see the detail of the stems with a very
distinct<00:01:34.650> pattern<00:01:35.009> in<00:01:35.130> the<00:01:35.220> background<00:01:35.729> which

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:35.909 
distinct pattern in the background which

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:38.359 
distinct pattern in the background which
is<00:01:35.939> just<00:01:36.299> like<00:01:36.509> a<00:01:36.540> dot<00:01:36.960> pattern<00:01:37.259> but<00:01:37.979> it<00:01:38.100> sets

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:38.369 
is just like a dot pattern but it sets

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:40.219 
is just like a dot pattern but it sets
off<00:01:38.610> the<00:01:38.790> background<00:01:39.329> so<00:01:39.540> that<00:01:39.659> you<00:01:39.780> can<00:01:39.960> see

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
off the background so that you can see

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:42.710 
off the background so that you can see
the<00:01:40.770> detail<00:01:41.159> in<00:01:41.369> the<00:01:41.460> birds<00:01:41.670> feathers<00:01:42.000> and<00:01:42.570> in

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720 
the detail in the birds feathers and in

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:46.520 
the detail in the birds feathers and in
the<00:01:43.350> flowers<00:01:43.860> the<00:01:44.159> petals<00:01:44.549> and<00:01:44.759> the<00:01:45.439> in<00:01:46.439> the

the flowers the petals and the in the

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:48.319 
the flowers the petals and the in the
back<00:01:46.740> on<00:01:47.009> the<00:01:47.159> handle<00:01:47.610> you<00:01:47.729> can<00:01:47.880> also<00:01:48.030> see

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:48.329 
back on the handle you can also see

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:50.240 
back on the handle you can also see
