just to show you what you'll be

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:07.760 
just to show you what you'll be
receiving<00:00:05.879> in<00:00:06.480> the<00:00:06.600> next<00:00:06.839> week<00:00:06.960> or<00:00:07.109> so<00:00:07.170> this<00:00:07.649> is

00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:07.770 
receiving in the next week or so this is

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:10.970 
receiving in the next week or so this is
the<00:00:07.890> analog<00:00:08.099> man<00:00:08.519> Sun<00:00:08.910> face<00:00:09.150> the<00:00:09.389> end<00:00:09.599> KT<00:00:10.080> 275

00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:10.980 
the analog man Sun face the end KT 275

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:12.950 
the analog man Sun face the end KT 275
that's<00:00:11.910> the<00:00:12.000> name<00:00:12.120> of<00:00:12.150> the<00:00:12.300> transistor<00:00:12.840> these

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:12.960 
that's the name of the transistor these

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:14.690 
that's the name of the transistor these
are<00:00:13.110> the<00:00:13.170> old<00:00:13.380> germanium<00:00:14.070> transistors<00:00:14.670> that

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:14.700 
are the old germanium transistors that

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:18.320 
are the old germanium transistors that
are<00:00:14.849> in<00:00:15.030> here<00:00:15.740> at<00:00:16.740> its<00:00:17.039> heart<00:00:17.340> it<00:00:17.730> is<00:00:17.850> a<00:00:17.880> fuzz

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:18.330 
are in here at its heart it is a fuzz

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:22.189 
are in here at its heart it is a fuzz
face<00:00:18.600> fuzz<00:00:19.260> pedal<00:00:20.090> but<00:00:21.090> it's<00:00:21.750> the<00:00:21.930> best

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:22.199 
face fuzz pedal but it's the best

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:24.759 
face fuzz pedal but it's the best
sounding<00:00:22.529> fuzz<00:00:22.769> face<00:00:22.980> and<00:00:23.340> you<00:00:23.550> know<00:00:23.580> I've<00:00:23.910> had

00:00:24.759 --> 00:00:24.769 
sounding fuzz face and you know I've had

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:27.380 
sounding fuzz face and you know I've had
loads<00:00:25.769> of<00:00:25.920> them<00:00:26.039> I've<00:00:26.189> made<00:00:26.430> loads<00:00:26.640> that<00:00:26.910> loads

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:27.390 
loads of them I've made loads that loads

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:30.080 
loads of them I've made loads that loads
of<00:00:27.570> fuzz<00:00:27.720> faces<00:00:28.140> and<00:00:28.320> but<00:00:28.949> this<00:00:29.160> this<00:00:29.699> one<00:00:29.910> is

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:30.090 
of fuzz faces and but this this one is

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:33.139 
of fuzz faces and but this this one is
just<00:00:30.240> spectacular<00:00:31.669> when<00:00:32.669> you<00:00:32.790> being<00:00:33.000> such<00:00:33.120> a

00:00:33.139 --> 00:00:33.149 
just spectacular when you being such a

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:34.639 
just spectacular when you being such a
big<00:00:33.329> fan<00:00:33.510> of<00:00:33.540> the<00:00:33.750> 60s<00:00:34.170> and<00:00:34.320> that<00:00:34.350> I<00:00:34.440> thought

00:00:34.639 --> 00:00:34.649 
big fan of the 60s and that I thought

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:38.299 
big fan of the 60s and that I thought
well<00:00:34.850> this<00:00:35.850> is<00:00:36.090> this<00:00:37.020> will<00:00:37.200> find<00:00:37.469> a<00:00:37.590> lovely<00:00:38.010> new

00:00:38.299 --> 00:00:38.309 
well this is this will find a lovely new

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:42.260 
well this is this will find a lovely new
home<00:00:38.989> so<00:00:39.989> just<00:00:40.610> just<00:00:41.610> so<00:00:41.730> you<00:00:41.790> can<00:00:41.879> hear<00:00:42.059> it<00:00:42.120> so

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270 
home so just just so you can hear it so

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:45.860 
home so just just so you can hear it so
this<00:00:42.420> is<00:00:42.570> the<00:00:43.190> my<00:00:44.190> telly<00:00:44.460> into<00:00:44.940> the<00:00:45.149> Sun<00:00:45.660> face

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
this is the my telly into the Sun face

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:48.709 
this is the my telly into the Sun face
going<00:00:46.200> straight<00:00:46.500> into<00:00:46.770> the<00:00:46.860> lazy<00:00:47.129> j-20<00:00:47.910> this

00:00:48.709 --> 00:00:48.719 
going straight into the lazy j-20 this

00:00:48.719 --> 00:01:02.209 
going straight into the lazy j-20 this
is<00:00:48.899> the<00:00:49.079> plain<00:00:49.770> sound<00:01:00.410> okay<00:01:01.410> let's<00:01:01.980> put<00:01:02.160> the

00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:02.219 
is the plain sound okay let's put the

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:04.939 
is the plain sound okay let's put the
pedals<00:01:02.520> on<00:01:02.930> so<00:01:03.930> here's<00:01:04.170> the<00:01:04.350> yes<00:01:04.559> and<00:01:04.830> the

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949 
pedals on so here's the yes and the

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:22.789 
pedals on so here's the yes and the
pedal

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:22.799 

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:26.130 

so<00:01:23.799> just<00:01:24.429> a<00:01:24.520> few<00:01:24.579> pointers<00:01:25.570> on<00:01:25.689> how<00:01:25.719> to<00:01:25.869> use

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:26.140 
so just a few pointers on how to use

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:30.480 
so just a few pointers on how to use
this<00:01:27.030> I'm<00:01:28.030> just<00:01:28.149> going<00:01:28.329> to<00:01:28.360> show<00:01:28.750> you<00:01:28.810> I<00:01:29.490> think

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:30.490 
this I'm just going to show you I think

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:33.270 
this I'm just going to show you I think
it's<00:01:30.759> okay<00:01:31.509> now<00:01:31.539> you<00:01:31.810> can<00:01:31.990> see<00:01:32.200> the<00:01:32.380> volume

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:33.280 
it's okay now you can see the volume

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:36.179 
it's okay now you can see the volume
control<00:01:33.850> here<00:01:34.149> with<00:01:35.110> the<00:01:35.259> volume<00:01:35.679> all<00:01:35.950> the<00:01:36.009> way

00:01:36.179 --> 00:01:36.189 
control here with the volume all the way

00:01:36.189 --> 00:01:47.180 
control here with the volume all the way
up<00:01:36.280> it's<00:01:37.030> just<00:01:37.149> it's<00:01:37.569> outrageous

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:47.190 

00:01:47.190 --> 00:02:02.539 

but<00:01:47.850> if<00:01:47.940> I<00:01:48.030> turn<00:01:48.090> the<00:01:48.450> volume<00:01:48.480> down

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:02.549 

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:05.660 

the<00:02:03.060> volume<00:02:03.600> control<00:02:04.140> is<00:02:04.439> really<00:02:04.950> the<00:02:05.070> key<00:02:05.369> to

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:05.670 
the volume control is really the key to

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:07.940 
the volume control is really the key to
getting<00:02:05.820> the<00:02:05.909> most<00:02:05.969> out<00:02:06.600> of<00:02:06.689> or<00:02:07.380> out<00:02:07.560> of<00:02:07.829> any

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:07.950 
getting the most out of or out of any

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:10.940 
getting the most out of or out of any
fun<00:02:08.190> space<00:02:08.459> really<00:02:08.970> especially<00:02:09.899> this<00:02:10.229> it's<00:02:10.530> so

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:10.950 
fun space really especially this it's so

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:12.650 
fun space really especially this it's so
interactive<00:02:11.550> with<00:02:11.670> the<00:02:11.700> volume<00:02:12.060> control<00:02:12.390> so

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:12.660 
interactive with the volume control so

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:14.960 
interactive with the volume control so
just<00:02:13.260> dialing<00:02:13.620> back<00:02:13.800> just<00:02:14.190> a<00:02:14.340> hair<00:02:14.370> gives<00:02:14.910> you

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:14.970 
just dialing back just a hair gives you

00:02:14.970 --> 00:04:15.840 
just dialing back just a hair gives you
the<00:02:15.060> most<00:02:15.180> beautiful<00:02:16.489> plain<00:02:17.489> sailing

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:15.850
