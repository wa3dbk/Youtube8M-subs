 Hi, I am Anabel and we are in her 

00:00:05.529 --> 00:00:10.090
 web space hands to work if your house 

00:00:08.109 --> 00:00:12.190
 Need a change of look starts with 

00:00:10.090 --> 00:00:15.990
 floors restores stained sockets 

00:00:12.190 --> 00:00:15.990
 of your room with this simple project 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:24.000
 the materials that we are going to use to 

00:00:20.110 --> 00:00:24.000
 this project are enamel 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:27.529
 solvent base 

00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:32.990
 a plastic protector for the floor 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:36.440
 and gloves 

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:39.809
 and more 15 

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:45.210
 and the tools that we will use are a 

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:45.210
 mixer 

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:49.469
 and a brush 

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:53.900
 I recommend that before buying the 

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:56.570
 solvent base decide what kind of 

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:58.610
 finish you want matte or glossy and 

00:00:56.570 --> 00:01:02.710
 also remember that before you start 

00:00:58.610 --> 00:01:02.710
 you must fix the floor sockets very well 

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:06.180
 do not 

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:13.190
 the first step is to place a plastic in 

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:15.580
 the floor to prevent staining 

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:15.580
 painting 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:18.920
 A) Yes 

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:23.690
 the second step is to cover all 

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:25.790
 areas that you need to protect with the 

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:29.260
 blue masking tape recalls that 

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:29.260
 this tape will not damage your paint 

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:38.950
 you have to do it very accurately 

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:41.740
 for the third step protect your hands 

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:43.210
 with gloves and open the windows then 

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:47.640
 with the help of a wooden stick or a 

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:47.640
 Mixer mixes the thinner and the enamel 

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:56.090
 the fourth step is to paint the socket for 

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:57.760
 that with a brush 

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:59.650
 yes 

00:01:57.760 --> 00:02:02.100
 feeling delicately so that it stays 

00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:02.100
 neat 

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:07.160
 yes 

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:11.460
 and then you will have to wait 24 hours 

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:13.410
 and in that moment you're just going to be able to 

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:16.250
 do the fifth step that is to apply a 

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:16.250
 second coat of paint 

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:23.800
 now if our socket already dry and has 

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:25.989
 perfect, go ahead and do yours
