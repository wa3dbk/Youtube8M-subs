 This way I will be enormously 

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:48.110
 grateful but if you can not or do not 

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:50.450
 you want not to worry I'll keep 

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:53.930
 making and uploading the tutorials every 

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:57.050
 week today we are going to draw a picture of a 

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:58.950
 Swarovski crystal bear I hope you 

00:01:57.050 --> 00:02:01.710
 like 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:05.740
 we start by plotting the general form of 

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:09.550
 body with loose movements 

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:12.250
 and then the head with the snout and 

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:17.440
 we give a little more detail to the 

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:20.170
 legs very well we correct the face and you 

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:21.520
 we make the ears eyes 

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:23.950
 [Music] 

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:25.330
 I think this leg was a little bit 

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:27.640
 big 

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:33.000
 let's do the best 

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:33.000
 with the bottom more or less like that 

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:38.000
 when we are happy with the way 

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:41.810
 general we can start doing things 

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:43.880
 smaller and smaller we recommend that 

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:45.890
 do detail at the beginning because you can 

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:49.570
 find that the form was wrong and 

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:49.570
 you have to erase all your work 

00:02:50.069 --> 00:02:54.930
 with the moldable eraser or made 

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:57.490
 any eraser we clean the lines 

00:02:54.930 --> 00:03:00.130
 that we will not use 

00:02:57.490 --> 00:03:02.290
 since we have the correct stroke what 

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:04.590
 first thing we're going to do is put 

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:08.670
 some lights 

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:11.220
 I'm using a dry pastel pencil or 

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:13.710
 it's like a stew 

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:16.590
 the rest of the drawing I will do with pencils 

00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:19.350
 of colors but like this cake does not 

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:22.500
 grab on the greasy surface of 

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:25.920
 the pencils then you have to put it 

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:28.920
 first and now if we turn to pencils 

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:31.110
 of colors starting with black what 

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:34.710
 we use to make the nose the eyes 

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:38.100
 and some dark reflections draw 

00:03:34.710 --> 00:03:40.800
 Crystal is very fun and for you to 

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:43.980
 see shining you have to put reflections 

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:47.720
 both very clear with a white white 

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:50.180
 as very dark with the black 

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:52.220
 the white of the colored pencils does not 

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:55.610
 it's so intense is the one that I'm 

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:58.220
 using for a few light shades but 

00:03:55.610 --> 00:03:59.950
 not as bright as the ones I did with 

00:03:58.220 --> 00:04:02.140
 the cake 

00:03:59.950 --> 00:04:06.879
 this figure is going to have a large number of 

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:09.190
 facets and cuts with many reflections we 

00:04:06.879 --> 00:04:11.950
 we can achieve with different shades of 

00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:15.720
 lighter and darker grays as well as 

00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:18.750
 with white and with black 

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:21.780
 here we draw squares and triangles 

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:23.940
 with a light gray if you're copying it 

00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:27.090
 you do not have to do it the same you can 

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:30.710
 create your own forms here below 

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:33.860
 we can put other darker 

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:36.700
 I like how it is being how it is going 

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:38.160
 taking shape and life itself 

00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:40.110
 [Music] 

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:42.440
 the list of materials is in the 

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:46.510
 information under the video 

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:49.270
 let's move to the last area 

00:04:46.510 --> 00:04:53.170
 We can also use colors as a 

00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:55.840
 light blue or others of this style to 

00:04:53.170 --> 00:04:59.170
 give more richness of tones and that not all 

00:04:55.840 --> 00:05:01.750
 look gray it 's important to also do 

00:04:59.170 --> 00:05:03.120
 reflections and certain shadows on the 

00:05:01.750 --> 00:05:06.900
 surface 

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:09.600
 [Music] 

00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:13.440
 we give you the final details and it goes to 

00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:16.259
 be ready if you liked please 

00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:19.949
