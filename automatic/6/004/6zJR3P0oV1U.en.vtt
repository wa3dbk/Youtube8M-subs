00:05:34.060 --> 00:05:37.440 

the<00:05:35.020> keyboard<00:05:35.260> is<00:05:35.740> a<00:05:36.130> lot<00:05:36.610> better<00:05:36.970> because<00:05:37.240> I'm

00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:37.450 
the keyboard is a lot better because I'm

00:05:37.450 --> 00:05:39.240 
the keyboard is a lot better because I'm
one<00:05:38.200> of<00:05:38.290> the<00:05:38.350> things<00:05:38.530> I<00:05:38.680> really<00:05:38.710> struggle<00:05:39.220> with

00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:39.250 
one of the things I really struggle with

00:05:39.250 --> 00:05:42.420 
one of the things I really struggle with
on<00:05:39.430> the<00:05:39.520> keyboard<00:05:39.910> is<00:05:40.030> the<00:05:40.060> actual<00:05:41.340> size<00:05:42.340> of

00:05:42.420 --> 00:05:42.430 
on the keyboard is the actual size of

00:05:42.430 --> 00:05:45.390 
on the keyboard is the actual size of
the<00:05:42.520> key<00:05:42.700> is<00:05:42.760> my<00:05:43.000> Thornton<00:05:43.720> is<00:05:43.840> quite<00:05:44.080> big<00:05:44.400> as

00:05:45.390 --> 00:05:45.400 
the key is my Thornton is quite big as

00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:48.270 
the key is my Thornton is quite big as
you<00:05:45.730> can<00:05:45.850> see<00:05:46.060> so<00:05:46.960> this<00:05:47.110> is<00:05:47.139> having<00:05:47.770> that<00:05:47.950> much

00:05:48.270 --> 00:05:48.280 
you can see so this is having that much

00:05:48.280 --> 00:05:49.890 
you can see so this is having that much
bigger<00:05:48.460> keyboard<00:05:48.760> makes<00:05:49.150> a<00:05:49.300> big<00:05:49.510> difference

00:05:49.890 --> 00:05:49.900 
bigger keyboard makes a big difference

00:05:49.900 --> 00:05:53.490 
bigger keyboard makes a big difference
