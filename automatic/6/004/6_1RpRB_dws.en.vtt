today on MX TV we'll be covering

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:12.470 
today on MX TV we'll be covering
torque<00:00:10.440> specifications<00:00:11.370> why<00:00:11.849> we<00:00:12.059> should<00:00:12.240> talk

00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:12.480 
torque specifications why we should talk

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:15.020 
torque specifications why we should talk
bolts<00:00:12.990> and<00:00:13.170> the<00:00:13.590> torque<00:00:13.860> wrench<00:00:14.130> and<00:00:14.370> to<00:00:14.849> what

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:15.030 
bolts and the torque wrench and to what

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:17.420 
bolts and the torque wrench and to what
specification<00:00:15.839> we<00:00:16.080> talk<00:00:16.350> them<00:00:16.529> at<00:00:16.680> the<00:00:17.100> reason

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:17.430 
specification we talk them at the reason

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:19.970 
specification we talk them at the reason
we<00:00:17.520> talk<00:00:17.730> bolts<00:00:18.150> is<00:00:18.359> one<00:00:19.109> of<00:00:19.230> two<00:00:19.410> things<00:00:19.619> to

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:19.980 
we talk bolts is one of two things to

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:21.890 
we talk bolts is one of two things to
stop<00:00:20.189> the<00:00:20.340> bolt<00:00:20.550> from<00:00:20.699> falling<00:00:21.119> out<00:00:21.240> to<00:00:21.660> stop<00:00:21.869> a

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:21.900 
stop the bolt from falling out to stop a

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:24.140 
stop the bolt from falling out to stop a
bolt<00:00:22.170> from<00:00:22.320> stripping<00:00:22.680> and<00:00:23.150> another

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:24.150 
bolt from stripping and another

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:25.970 
bolt from stripping and another
important<00:00:24.720> sort<00:00:24.960> of<00:00:25.050> thing<00:00:25.230> is<00:00:25.500> a<00:00:25.529> crush

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:25.980 
important sort of thing is a crush

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:29.599 
important sort of thing is a crush
because<00:00:26.699> a<00:00:27.119> tight<00:00:27.630> bolt<00:00:28.050> will<00:00:28.650> cause<00:00:28.859> crush<00:00:29.250> to

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:29.609 
because a tight bolt will cause crush to

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:31.820 
because a tight bolt will cause crush to
the<00:00:29.699> material<00:00:30.179> here<00:00:30.810> we<00:00:30.929> have<00:00:31.109> the<00:00:31.289> the<00:00:31.320> front

this<00:00:35.100> is<00:00:35.280> designed<00:00:35.640> as<00:00:35.790> a<00:00:35.820> pinch<00:00:36.120> boat<00:00:36.360> bolt

00:00:36.709 --> 00:00:36.719 
this is designed as a pinch boat bolt

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:39.110 
this is designed as a pinch boat bolt
only<00:00:37.200> obviously<00:00:38.040> too<00:00:38.399> tight<00:00:38.670> of<00:00:38.820> the<00:00:38.879> bolt

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120 
only obviously too tight of the bolt

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:41.240 
only obviously too tight of the bolt
will<00:00:39.570> cause<00:00:39.840> prolonged<00:00:40.500> damage<00:00:40.829> to<00:00:41.070> your

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:41.250 
will cause prolonged damage to your

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:43.490 
will cause prolonged damage to your
actual<00:00:41.460> triple<00:00:41.850> clamp<00:00:42.059> and<00:00:42.239> thread<00:00:42.500> possibly

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:43.500 
actual triple clamp and thread possibly

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:46.310 
actual triple clamp and thread possibly
even<00:00:43.649> stripping<00:00:44.190> the<00:00:44.280> bolt<00:00:44.520> so<00:00:45.329> the

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
even stripping the bolt so the

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:48.260 
even stripping the bolt so the
manufacturers<00:00:46.920> designed<00:00:47.340> a<00:00:47.460> specification

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:48.270 
manufacturers designed a specification

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:52.310 
manufacturers designed a specification
clearly<00:00:48.989> to<00:00:49.640> prevent<00:00:50.640> this<00:00:50.850> and<00:00:51.180> it'll<00:00:51.989> affect

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320 
clearly to prevent this and it'll affect

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:53.660 
clearly to prevent this and it'll affect
the<00:00:52.410> handling<00:00:52.620> if<00:00:52.949> it's<00:00:53.070> too<00:00:53.250> tight<00:00:53.460> because

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
the handling if it's too tight because

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:55.639 
the handling if it's too tight because
of<00:00:53.940> the<00:00:54.030> Flex<00:00:54.300> characteristic<00:00:55.079> of<00:00:55.199> the<00:00:55.350> triple

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:55.649 
of the Flex characteristic of the triple

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:57.580 
of the Flex characteristic of the triple
clamp<00:00:55.860> so<00:00:56.460> what<00:00:56.640> you'll<00:00:56.760> find<00:00:56.969> for<00:00:57.210> example
