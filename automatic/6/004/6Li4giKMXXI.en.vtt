00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.130
 brings the new models abroad 

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:06.960
 daiger 800 

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:09.150
 I'll try to show here some of the 

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:11.160
 differences that I have not looking at 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:13.170
 some videos and photos that are 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:15.410
 available on the internet 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:18.060
 The main difference I noticed was 

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:22.650
 in that part of the bike in that fairing 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:24.990
 Zinho is the time changed quite well until 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:28.199
 down here more or less a new 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:31.710
 different model that this model here 

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:33.989
 here is less but this part 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:36.899
 of the fairing is much larger and has a 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:41.129
 air intake here in the place of this 

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:43.590
 cover a picture then it's a montage with 

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:46.710
 two models of the tag a model totally 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:53.579
 sold in brazil who is called betrays 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:56.280
 Tega being now her name is taiga xr 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:59.370
 there abroad the 2015 model 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:02.940
 and here in this assembly you can see the 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:06.060
 main difference in terms of 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:07.950
 appearance and functionality of the 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:11.100
 part of the fairing that is quite different 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:15.810
 from one model to the other to 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:20.040
 to note that the flow of hot air 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:23.400
 and radiator is captured here in the 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:25.290
 radiator that are in this part here and the 

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:29.640
 outlet of that hot air than in the 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:31.770
 current is is not does not receive any 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:34.710
 resistance has no fairing 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:41.939
 here that can contain this flow in the 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:44.570
 new model new model is hot air 

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:49.130
 that sung here to cool the 

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:53.130
 radiator has these two exits here 

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:55.670
 significantly large when 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:02:00.090
 compared to this little get out of here 

00:01:55.670 --> 00:02:03.030
 of the current model in Brazil and the air that 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:06.560
 everything here or freely for this 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:08.729
 party concerned a complaint 

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:11.220
 suddenly warming of the legs 

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:13.040
 this model that looks like it has a flow 

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:17.359
 of better air 

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:21.799
 is to divert the hot air from the 

00:02:17.359 --> 00:02:25.790
 pass the radio now another part is that 

00:02:21.799 --> 00:02:28.549
 It's noticeable that this protection has changed. 

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:31.069
 of the current that in the taiga of the current model 

00:02:28.549 --> 00:02:33.349
 and so far is one of the things that the 

00:02:31.069 --> 00:02:34.760
 staff says that it comes up depending 

00:02:33.349 --> 00:02:37.370
 the type of lubricant you are using 

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:43.030
 chain to mount the 

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:45.769
 current is lower than the model in the 

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:48.530
 a straight road you will see that it has 

00:02:45.769 --> 00:02:51.129
 all that part of the chain that does not 

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:53.180
 no protection at all 

00:02:51.129 --> 00:02:55.669
 then depending on how you 

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:58.519
 it never stays current 

00:02:55.669 --> 00:03:02.989
 if it is a little thinner this oil will 

00:02:58.519 --> 00:03:08.919
 jump here on the kid's leg or get dirty 

00:03:02.989 --> 00:03:11.840
 motorcycle extended the current protector 

00:03:08.919 --> 00:03:18.349
 well beyond the current then there is all this 

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:19.849
 area of protection here than it has 

00:03:18.349 --> 00:03:26.120
 in the current 

00:03:19.849 --> 00:03:31.400
 Another thing that changed was the 

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:34.370
 Brazil is a comfortable bench but it seems 

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:36.739
 that it has a better finish and the 

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:38.949
 material of the seat cover appears to be 

00:03:36.739 --> 00:03:38.949
 best 

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:47.150
 apparent seams 

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:51.859
 meanwhile it has no stitching 

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:53.479
 which is perhaps only aesthetic 

00:03:51.859 --> 00:03:56.000
 looking the other side of the bike you can see 

00:03:53.479 --> 00:03:58.220
 how different is the new new fairing 

00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:00.709
 caneÃ£ and protects much more motor and is 

00:03:58.220 --> 00:04:08.659
 much less exposed all this area here 

00:04:00.709 --> 00:04:12.650
 year in the autumn exposed here by the new 

00:04:08.659 --> 00:04:13.750
 fairing again to the small exit of 

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:18.420
 air 

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:20.790
 enter here leave behind here 

00:04:18.420 --> 00:04:27.100
 while this one goes here and 

00:04:20.790 --> 00:04:31.320
 is probably rebounded in these two 

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:31.320
 in these two parts of the fairing
