section three thoracic vertebrae typical

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:19.930 
section three thoracic vertebrae typical
dobrze<00:00:17.170> we<00:00:18.170> use<00:00:18.380> thoracic<00:00:19.040> vertebra<00:00:19.520> earlier

00:00:19.930 --> 00:00:19.940 
dobrze we use thoracic vertebra earlier

00:00:19.940 --> 00:00:23.230 
dobrze we use thoracic vertebra earlier
to<00:00:20.330> define<00:00:20.780> typical<00:00:21.530> features<00:00:22.100> of<00:00:22.240> typical

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:23.240 
to define typical features of typical

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:25.210 
to define typical features of typical

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:08.510 
vertebrae so let's take a look so here

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:11.800 
vertebrae so let's take a look so here
we<00:04:08.930> are<00:04:08.960> we're<00:04:09.830> saying<00:04:10.160> here<00:04:10.640> all<00:04:10.880> 12<00:04:11.570> thoracic

plastic cord and of course the spaces
that<00:04:18.560> we<00:04:18.859> would<00:04:19.040> expect<00:04:19.430> to<00:04:19.609> have<00:04:19.850> between

that we would expect to have between

living<00:04:23.480> person<00:04:23.720> would<00:04:24.110> be<00:04:24.320> far<00:04:24.800> greater

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:24.830 
living person would be far greater

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:27.010 
living person would be far greater
because<00:04:25.700> they<00:04:25.880> would<00:04:26.060> possess<00:04:26.420> the
