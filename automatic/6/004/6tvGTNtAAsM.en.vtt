00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:47.510 
too good for ps3 already did so we're

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:50.619 
too good for ps3 already did so we're
going<00:00:47.629> to<00:00:47.719> get<00:00:47.809> started<00:00:48.170> and<00:00:49.390> since<00:00:50.390> these<00:00:50.570> two

00:00:50.619 --> 00:00:50.629 
going to get started and since these two

00:00:50.629 --> 00:00:53.020 
going to get started and since these two
of<00:00:50.960> us<00:00:51.140> we're<00:00:51.710> going<00:00:51.949> to<00:00:52.039> make<00:00:52.250> a<00:00:52.309> double<00:00:52.730> watch

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:53.030 
of us we're going to make a double watch

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:56.819 
of us we're going to make a double watch
their<00:00:53.359> case<00:00:53.660> and<00:00:54.019> you<00:00:54.980> don't<00:00:55.160> have<00:00:55.370> to<00:00:55.699> and

00:00:56.819 --> 00:00:56.829

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:01.690 
also if you want to make spiral case

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:06.370 
also if you want to make spiral case
that's<00:01:02.690> okay<00:01:03.350> we're<00:01:04.280> just<00:01:04.550> doing<00:01:04.940> a<00:01:05.380> straight

00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:06.380 
that's okay we're just doing a straight

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:10.840 
that's okay we're just doing a straight
staircase<00:01:07.540> infer<00:01:08.620> preference<00:01:09.620> it<00:01:10.190> doesn't

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:10.850 
staircase infer preference it doesn't

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:13.930 
staircase infer preference it doesn't
make<00:01:11.600> any<00:01:11.659> difference<00:01:12.050> in<00:01:12.680> planning<00:01:13.100> time<00:01:13.310> and

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:13.940 
make any difference in planning time and

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:17.530 
make any difference in planning time and
so<00:01:14.750> what<00:01:15.200> we're<00:01:15.409> going<00:01:15.590> to<00:01:15.680> do<00:01:16.000> is<00:01:17.000> we're<00:01:17.360> going

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:17.540 
so what we're going to do is we're going

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:21.310 
so what we're going to do is we're going
to<00:01:17.600> mine<00:01:18.409> the<00:01:19.159> staircase<00:01:19.790> all<00:01:20.540> the<00:01:20.810> way<00:01:20.960> until

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:21.320 
to mine the staircase all the way until

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:23.740 
to mine the staircase all the way until
we<00:01:21.649> get<00:01:21.799> to<00:01:21.920> the<00:01:22.040> bottom<00:01:22.250> of<00:01:22.759> the<00:01:23.000> map<00:01:23.210> and<00:01:23.540> we

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:23.750 
we get to the bottom of the map and we

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:28.690 
we get to the bottom of the map and we
hit<00:01:24.020> bedrock<00:01:24.700> so<00:01:25.700> I'm<00:01:26.630> pause<00:01:27.140> video<00:01:27.520> once<00:01:28.520> we

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:28.700 
hit bedrock so I'm pause video once we

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:32.790 
hit bedrock so I'm pause video once we
hit<00:01:28.880> bedrock<00:01:29.119> I'll<00:01:29.630> start<00:01:29.899> it<00:01:29.990> back<00:01:30.140> up

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:32.800 

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:36.250 

hey<00:01:33.800> guys<00:01:34.070> too<00:01:34.640> good<00:01:34.880> for<00:01:35.090> ps3<00:01:35.360> is<00:01:35.570> just<00:01:35.960> enough

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:36.260 
hey guys too good for ps3 is just enough

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:38.110 
hey guys too good for ps3 is just enough
so<00:01:36.470> that<00:01:36.500> we<00:01:36.740> struck<00:01:37.070> bedrock<00:01:37.550> so<00:01:37.820> I'm<00:01:37.940> going

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:38.120 
so that we struck bedrock so I'm going

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:42.430 
so that we struck bedrock so I'm going
to<00:01:38.210> explain<00:01:38.600> the<00:01:38.840> layers<00:01:39.110> in<00:01:40.240> the<00:01:41.240> xbox<00:01:41.720> 360

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:42.440 
to explain the layers in the xbox 360

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:45.550 
to explain the layers in the xbox 360
edition<00:01:42.800> they<00:01:43.760> have<00:01:44.090> two<00:01:44.540> layers<00:01:44.870> of<00:01:45.020> bedrock

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:45.560 
edition they have two layers of bedrock

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:49.800 
edition they have two layers of bedrock
and<00:01:46.210> the<00:01:47.210> bottom<00:01:47.600> layer<00:01:47.750> bedrock<00:01:48.350> I<00:01:48.620> call

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:49.810 
and the bottom layer bedrock I call

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:53.290 
and the bottom layer bedrock I call
level<00:01:50.810> nothing<00:01:51.380> and<00:01:51.650> the<00:01:52.250> top<00:01:52.520> layer<00:01:52.760> bedrock

00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:53.300 
level nothing and the top layer bedrock

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:56.859 
level nothing and the top layer bedrock
I<00:01:53.510> call<00:01:53.750> level<00:01:54.590> 0<00:01:54.860> and<00:01:55.850> then<00:01:56.240> when<00:01:56.600> i'm<00:01:56.720> looking

00:01:56.859 --> 00:01:56.869 
I call level 0 and then when i'm looking

00:01:56.869 --> 00:02:01.890 
I call level 0 and then when i'm looking
for<00:01:57.229> diamond<00:01:57.619> i<00:01:57.830> go<00:01:58.100> level<00:01:58.340> nothing<00:01:59.830> level<00:02:00.830> 0

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:01.900 
for diamond i go level nothing level 0

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:08.710 
for diamond i go level nothing level 0
and<00:02:02.900> then<00:02:03.320> i<00:02:03.440> go<00:02:03.680> all<00:02:04.220> the<00:02:04.430> way<00:02:04.460> up<00:02:04.850> to<00:02:06.700> level<00:02:07.720> 12

00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:08.720 
and then i go all the way up to level 12

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:16.030 
and then i go all the way up to level 12
and<00:02:09.200> 13<00:02:09.830> is<00:02:10.160> what<00:02:10.729> I<00:02:10.759> mind<00:02:12.100> so<00:02:13.100> I<00:02:14.739> stand<00:02:15.739> on

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:16.040 
and 13 is what I mind so I stand on

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:22.800 
and 13 is what I mind so I stand on
level<00:02:17.030> 11<00:02:17.570> and<00:02:20.260> reason<00:02:21.260> I<00:02:21.380> do<00:02:21.440> this<00:02:21.590> is<00:02:21.830> because

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:22.810 
level 11 and reason I do this is because

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:26.680 
level 11 and reason I do this is because
diamond<00:02:23.810> is<00:02:24.050> found<00:02:24.830> anywhere<00:02:25.520> between<00:02:25.850> level

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:26.690 
diamond is found anywhere between level

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:32.580 
diamond is found anywhere between level
0<00:02:27.080> and<00:02:27.470> 20<00:02:27.800> and<00:02:28.420> rarely<00:02:29.590> 21<00:02:30.590> through<00:02:30.830> 23<00:02:31.190> and

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:32.590 
0 and 20 and rarely 21 through 23 and

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:36.759 
0 and 20 and rarely 21 through 23 and
the<00:02:33.590> most<00:02:33.860> common<00:02:34.580> spot<00:02:35.000> to<00:02:35.660> find<00:02:35.959> diamond<00:02:36.500> are

00:02:36.759 --> 00:02:36.769 
the most common spot to find diamond are

00:02:36.769 --> 00:02:42.699 
the most common spot to find diamond are
layers<00:02:37.269> 10<00:02:38.269> through<00:02:38.600> 16<00:02:39.970> so<00:02:40.970> I<00:02:41.450> just<00:02:41.930> mind

00:02:42.699 --> 00:02:42.709 
layers 10 through 16 so I just mind

00:02:42.709 --> 00:02:47.620 
layers 10 through 16 so I just mind
right<00:02:43.010> in<00:02:43.190> the<00:02:43.250> middle<00:02:43.430> at<00:02:43.840> well<00:02:44.840> be<00:02:45.049> 13<00:02:46.630> that

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:47.630 
right in the middle at well be 13 that

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:51.520 
right in the middle at well be 13 that
lava<00:02:48.200> spawns<00:02:48.739> on<00:02:49.250> level<00:02:49.640> 10<00:02:49.940> and<00:02:50.530> usually

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:51.530 
lava spawns on level 10 and usually

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:55.360 
lava spawns on level 10 and usually
you're<00:02:51.769> going<00:02:51.950> to<00:02:52.040> find<00:02:52.660> diamond<00:02:53.660> by<00:02:53.959> love<00:02:54.370> so

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:55.370 
you're going to find diamond by love so
