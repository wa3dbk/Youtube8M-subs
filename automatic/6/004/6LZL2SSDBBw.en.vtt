 I'm beautiful, I'm here for more 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:17.789
 an adventure 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:19.350
 This is even more of an adventure here in gt 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:22.619
 that 's how you see it in the middle of the 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:27.080
 Who helped me in this episode? 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:34.399
 Okay, what I put it in is out. 

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:34.399
 olympique such as the h1n1 gui r or flashback 

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:42.930
 that some parts of it have participated ii 

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:44.730
 is watching this guy and playing the drum 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:47.129
 and was trying to take a self 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:50.370
 I could not even talk to him. 

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:53.250
 press the mouse buttons and even then 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:59.940
 I can not see the surprise 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:01:01.260
 that will appear soon enough good 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:03.989
 that I have that I had to speak the 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:07.590
 next I was playing and not that one. 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:10.799
 so the passive there, that's what I talk about 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:14.369
 which is for those who do not know how to play even as 

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:18.570
 I will come and move, I'll get one shot. 

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:20.900
 kill and that's it for who it is 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:25.229
 end of rock only 

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:28.020
 just look at this the user is using 

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:31.500
 rakineh and put us this little house and 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:34.619
 This was happening with all the 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:37.310
 this a home for sale and 

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:37.310
 food ne 

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:43.930
 I had a rack I want using the radio 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:48.610
 I was making fun of everyone there. 

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:54.760
 the game started to catch fire I had 

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:59.010
 there the drum is there, the little uncle died 

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:59.010
 nor did he die toast there right? 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:11.380
 the hack there he started playing the 

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:13.720
 puppies and delay holding them away 

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:18.730
 You'll see that out of nowhere you're shot. 

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:22.140
 also there in the game I'm not touching and not 

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:22.140
 I can leave inside, right? 

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:30.180
 the dogs there né 

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:38.440
 and it was really cool that I left there 

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:41.200
 I saw that there were people who wanted to 

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:44.920
 I took the shots yet I stand up 

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:47.200
 I can leave the place 

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:50.100
 this little house but he has others 

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:52.299
 is that the hacker will put 

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:55.930
 You 'll see what happens. 

00:02:52.299 --> 00:02:57.820
 And then there are people on that day that I 

00:02:55.930 --> 00:03:00.700
 I played I had defeated the dindinho of 

00:02:57.820 --> 00:03:02.739
 dogs is on that day that we're 

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:05.670
 In order to play I found this very nice 

00:03:02.739 --> 00:03:08.080
 I check is in passive mode yet 

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:10.510
 because this hack does not work if you 

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:13.420
 you have it works both in the 

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:16.680
 normal as in the mode the passive is the 

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:16.680
 dog will attack me right? 

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:23.629
 I can not attack because in mode 

00:03:21.769 --> 00:03:25.099
 Passive, you can not hit it either. 

00:03:23.629 --> 00:03:31.580
 pull the gun right 

00:03:25.099 --> 00:03:33.879
 but turn around killing then here comes the sial 

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:39.829
 type ç fernan we take a walk around 

00:03:33.879 --> 00:03:41.599
 helicopter in transparent so because 

00:03:39.829 --> 00:03:44.319
 just the group and the process anyway 

00:03:41.599 --> 00:03:44.319
 passive right 

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:53.770

 It's wood and it's very cool, that's right. 

00:05:39.770 --> 00:05:44.960
