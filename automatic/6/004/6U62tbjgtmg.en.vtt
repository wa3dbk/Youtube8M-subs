it<00:01:03.899> works<00:01:04.170> out<00:01:04.409> somehow<00:01:04.890> and<00:01:05.100> that's<00:01:05.460> how<00:01:05.670> we

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
it works out somehow and that's how we

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:08.000 
it works out somehow and that's how we
get<00:01:06.090> the<00:01:06.150> actual<00:01:06.689> stock<00:01:06.960> market<00:01:07.380> so<00:01:07.530> this<00:01:07.740> is

get the actual stock market so this is
very<00:01:08.250> very<00:01:08.369> much<00:01:08.610> like<00:01:08.790> the<00:01:09.150> real<00:01:09.540> stock

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:09.869

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
now this is not talking about

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:16.940 
now this is not talking about
recessionary<00:01:15.090> like<00:01:15.330> that<00:01:15.540> normally<00:01:16.500> the<00:01:16.799> real

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
recessionary like that normally the real

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:19.820 
recessionary like that normally the real
stock<00:01:17.310> market<00:01:17.759> doesn't<00:01:18.030> fluctuate<00:01:18.830> huge

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830 
stock market doesn't fluctuate huge

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:23.090 
stock market doesn't fluctuate huge
amounts<00:01:20.610> like<00:01:21.119> the<00:01:21.270> LCN<00:01:21.930> it<00:01:22.200> fluctuates

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
amounts like the LCN it fluctuates

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:26.120 
amounts like the LCN it fluctuates
massively<00:01:24.090> it's<00:01:24.509> huge<00:01:25.049> this<00:01:25.590> is<00:01:25.650> more

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
massively it's huge this is more

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:27.560 
massively it's huge this is more
realistic<00:01:26.520> this<00:01:26.759> is<00:01:26.939> very<00:01:27.180> realistic

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570 
realistic this is very realistic

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:30.499 
realistic this is very realistic
actually<00:01:28.200> of<00:01:28.380> a<00:01:28.770> real<00:01:29.100> stock<00:01:29.549> market<00:01:30.090> so<00:01:30.270> as
