from<00:02:04.710> the<00:02:04.770> bottom<00:02:05.130> here<00:02:05.310> I<00:02:05.490> can<00:02:05.909> access<00:02:06.060> this

00:02:06.319 --> 00:02:06.329 
from the bottom here I can access this

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:08.359 
from the bottom here I can access this
pretty<00:02:06.570> comfortably<00:02:07.110> with<00:02:07.290> one<00:02:07.530> hand<00:02:07.860> but

00:02:08.359 --> 00:02:08.369 
pretty comfortably with one hand but

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:10.130 
pretty comfortably with one hand but
beyond<00:02:08.670> that<00:02:08.819> you<00:02:09.599> know<00:02:09.690> might<00:02:09.869> be<00:02:09.899> a<00:02:09.989> little

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:10.140 
beyond that you know might be a little

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:11.780 
beyond that you know might be a little
bit<00:02:10.289> too<00:02:10.440> big<00:02:10.649> if<00:02:10.800> you<00:02:10.860> get<00:02:10.950> them<00:02:11.039> to<00:02:11.160> 5.5<00:02:11.730> or

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:11.790 
bit too big if you get them to 5.5 or

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:13.790 
bit too big if you get them to 5.5 or
5.7<00:02:12.599> so<00:02:12.720> still<00:02:12.989> even<00:02:13.470> though<00:02:13.530> it'll

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:13.800 
5.7 so still even though it'll

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:15.350 
5.7 so still even though it'll
bigger<00:02:14.040> than<00:02:14.070> 5<00:02:14.370> and<00:02:14.610> I've<00:02:14.670> talked<00:02:14.940> about<00:02:15.150> five

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:15.360 
bigger than 5 and I've talked about five
