own objective sort of structure so

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:58.660 
own objective sort of structure so
over<00:00:57.110> the<00:00:57.230> city<00:00:57.470> there<00:00:57.710> were<00:00:57.770> certain<00:00:58.100> points

00:00:58.660 --> 00:00:58.670

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:00.470 
in the map but we had to basically go to

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:02.920 
in the map but we had to basically go to
your<00:01:01.280> son<00:01:01.490> objectives<00:01:01.970> like<00:01:02.120> pick<00:01:02.300> up<00:01:02.390> files
