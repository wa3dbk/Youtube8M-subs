00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.510
 I greet all the HDblog readers from 

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:05.759
 adam and j 

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:10.050
 today we offer a short video test 

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:12.269
 of reading mark files a title on ios 

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:15.599
 obviously third generation ipad the 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:18.180
 test device that inspires you 

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:20.279
 from how he makes the character understand the name 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:23.670
 by riddick interpreted in the saga 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:25.289
 film from vin diesel a game 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:29.099
 really interesting for both 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:30.840
 film buffs both for 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:33.079
 lovers of strategic titles 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:35.579
 let's talk about a stealth game indeed 

00:00:33.079 --> 00:00:39.050
 interesting with a view from above that 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:39.050
 we show you immediately 

00:01:00.379 --> 00:01:06.810
 we entered the main menu of 

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:09.810
 redick demark file as you see 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:11.840
 options are not many and beyond 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:16.020
 of the north where it will be possible 

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:18.869
 view other statistical games and 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:21.830
 the classic credits of the title 

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:23.880
 let's go straight to the play section 

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:26.340
 initially it is proposed in 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:28.440
 automatic a tutorial then to the first 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:31.470
 We will start the game immediately 

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:34.800
 inserted in the action to give way to 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:37.410
 quickly understand the controls and the 

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:39.660
 The type of rule the dark game is 

00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:41.789
 the preview of the next defendant who 

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:45.090
 will be published as a form of 

00:01:41.789 --> 00:01:48.330
 update for the title while of 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:50.680
 virus and the first playable campaign 

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:53.350
 this will be 

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:56.290
 the screen to select missions 

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:58.270
 unlocked obviously you will need to overcome them 

00:01:56.290 --> 00:02:00.310
 a dune and it will be an increasing difficulty 

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:05.190
 to be able to access the following ones 

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:07.330
 it was called a stealth action with 

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:08.590
 strategy elements 

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:10.920
 what should we do? 

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:13.930
 immediately in the first level 

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:15.970
 first the goals will be 

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:19.750
 You can choose three types of 

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:22.300
 takedown escape goal where we will have to 

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:25.060
 in essence, bringing down the guards 

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:26.650
 present flash ie recover 

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:29.200
 the object is to escape 

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:30.780
 let's try to face the first phase 

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:33.970
 that of escape 

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:35.620
 as you see a view from above for 

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:37.780
 what a gift and a lot of graphics 

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:39.459
 detailed as we will 

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:42.459
 there are a lot of checks 

00:02:39.459 --> 00:02:44.470
 simple with a tap on the display 

00:02:42.459 --> 00:02:47.680
 we will move our character with a 

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:48.459
 double tap on a point of course 

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:52.000
 we will do again 

00:02:48.459 --> 00:02:54.700
 but this will make us vulnerable because 

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:56.320
 our steps obviously heavier 

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:59.980
 guards will be heard 

00:02:56.320 --> 00:03:02.530
 they will control the zones so we will have to 

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:05.380
 move with great care try to 

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:06.910
 stay in the shadows and show us the 

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:10.370
 as little as possible 

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:12.260
 as for the rotation, it will be enough 

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:14.870
 keep the display pressed and move 

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:16.190
 very sensitive checks really well 

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:20.450
 facts 

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:23.319
 we also have a visual control 

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:27.400
 on the vicinity on the distance with the 

00:03:23.319 --> 00:03:29.720
 pinch to zoom so zooming and 

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:33.650
 tightening the view 

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:36.190
 we will enter a sort of map instead 

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:39.769
 zooming in this sense we will approach 

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:43.069
 further we try to face 

00:03:39.769 --> 00:03:46.099
 this first scheme which obviously will be 

00:03:43.069 --> 00:03:49.640
 very simple compared to the following ones 

00:03:46.099 --> 00:03:51.950
 as you see cession a guard must 

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:54.290
 try not to be seen 

00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:56.629
 consequently we take advantage of the moment 

00:03:54.290 --> 00:04:02.510
 in which she passes to get them to 

00:03:56.629 --> 00:04:05.569
 shoulders and we performed ours 

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:09.620
 Then the ground in Mestre guard us 

00:04:05.569 --> 00:04:12.500
 will leave a weapon if armed will be possible 

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:16.269
 also carry the body 

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:18.889
 let's see if this is useful in 

00:04:16.269 --> 00:04:21.289
 certain schemes where the guards 

00:04:18.889 --> 00:04:24.500
 will be multiple as they leave a 

00:04:21.289 --> 00:04:28.090
 corpse on the ground will set off the alarm 

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:31.160
 consequently they will come looking for us 

00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:35.450
 we abandon the body we control where 

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:40.250
 the exit we reach our goal for 

00:04:35.450 --> 00:04:42.620
 to be able to finish the double cup level yes 

00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:46.250
 said our riddick will come into 

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:48.380
 running mode accordingly the shoes 

00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:51.710
 we finished takedown and match for 

00:04:48.380 --> 00:04:53.419
 we already had this type of scheme 

00:04:51.710 --> 00:04:55.849
 made another particularity 

00:04:53.419 --> 00:04:59.389
 interesting of the title is that of 

00:04:55.849 --> 00:05:02.930
 to be able to review the video then with watch 

00:04:59.389 --> 00:05:05.900
 we will enter the vision mode in 

00:05:02.930 --> 00:05:09.220
 substance a replay where you can 

00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:09.220
 view our performance 

00:05:11.030 --> 00:05:16.529
 this is a marginal aspect of the thing 

00:05:14.060 --> 00:05:19.079
 because it is more designed for 

00:05:16.529 --> 00:05:22.319
 for a sharing in fact as you see 

00:05:19.079 --> 00:05:25.669
 on the right is the option available 

00:05:22.319 --> 00:05:29.939
 share option share that will let us in 

00:05:25.669 --> 00:05:32.219
 in the every play channel where we can 

00:05:29.939 --> 00:05:33.749
 make our video enter the 

00:05:32.219 --> 00:05:35.879
 our content also display 

00:05:33.749 --> 00:05:38.489
 that of other users who are 

00:05:35.879 --> 00:05:40.609
 playing nerd rugby file 

00:05:38.489 --> 00:05:44.509
 a very interesting option in optics 

00:05:40.609 --> 00:05:46.889
 sharing that is also useful for 

00:05:44.509 --> 00:05:48.599
 view the resolution of 

00:05:46.889 --> 00:05:51.989
 certain patterns to the approach that 

00:05:48.599 --> 00:05:55.949
 other players have come out of this 

00:05:51.989 --> 00:05:58.289
 visual and let's go into the selection in the 

00:05:55.949 --> 00:06:00.779
 levels to show you something of a 

00:05:58.289 --> 00:06:02.129
 more complex goal number 

00:06:00.779 --> 00:06:05.189
 4 

00:06:02.129 --> 00:06:07.789
 let's try the escape mode in this case 

00:06:05.189 --> 00:06:11.459
 the difficulty will certainly be higher 

00:06:07.789 --> 00:06:14.219
 the advice is in this game of 

00:06:11.459 --> 00:06:16.919
 to wait and study the movements of the 

00:06:14.219 --> 00:06:19.819
 opponents so you can build one 

00:06:16.919 --> 00:06:19.819
 winning strategy 

00:06:20.819 --> 00:06:26.069
 as you see in this case we have 

00:06:22.769 --> 00:06:29.029
 wrong because although the guard of 

00:06:26.069 --> 00:06:32.699
 in front of us was reachable e 

00:06:29.029 --> 00:06:35.119
 will land bill and the one coming has us 

00:06:32.699 --> 00:06:35.119
 seen 

00:06:52.540 --> 00:06:58.940
 we left a corpse this is 

00:06:55.580 --> 00:07:00.170
 made to alert others 

00:06:58.940 --> 00:07:02.720
 guards accordingly if they want 

00:07:00.170 --> 00:07:07.700
 look for us and with very good chances there 

00:07:02.720 --> 00:07:09.440
 they will kill us he saw us and he shot us 

00:07:07.700 --> 00:07:12.410
 consequently we failed to 

00:07:09.440 --> 00:07:13.910
 complete level as you see beyond 

00:07:12.410 --> 00:07:15.770
 of the first scheme which was rather 

00:07:13.910 --> 00:07:18.530
 simple complexity will increase 

00:07:15.770 --> 00:07:22.000
 a lot of the title can be purchased from 

00:07:18.530 --> 00:07:25.310
 app store for two euros is 69 if I'm not mistaken 

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:27.770
 I would say that for this video test is everything 

00:07:25.310 --> 00:07:30.170
 adam and j blog shack greets you and 

00:07:27.770 --> 00:07:32.470
 see you at the next videos, hello a 

00:07:30.170 --> 00:07:32.470
 all
