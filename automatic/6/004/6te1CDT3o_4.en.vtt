00:00:08.030 --> 00:00:08.040 
three finalists for Player of the Year I

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:10.400

think<00:00:08.820> that<00:00:09.030> you<00:00:09.870> know<00:00:09.960> it's<00:00:10.110> something<00:00:10.200> to

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:10.410 
think that you know it's something to

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:11.839 
think that you know it's something to
say<00:00:10.620> about<00:00:10.769> our<00:00:10.830> team<00:00:11.130> that<00:00:11.160> we<00:00:11.429> have<00:00:11.580> two

00:00:11.839 --> 00:00:11.849 
say about our team that we have two

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:15.410 
say about our team that we have two
members<00:00:12.630> from<00:00:13.070> the<00:00:14.070> US<00:00:14.099> national<00:00:14.670> team<00:00:14.880> on<00:00:15.089> the

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:15.420 
members from the US national team on the

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:17.840 
members from the US national team on the
finalist<00:00:15.960> list<00:00:16.199> to<00:00:16.740> have<00:00:16.890> both<00:00:17.160> Alex<00:00:17.580> and<00:00:17.730> I

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:17.850 
finalist list to have both Alex and I

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:20.240 
finalist list to have both Alex and I
going<00:00:18.779> over<00:00:18.900> and<00:00:19.320> representing<00:00:19.980> our<00:00:20.100> whole

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:20.250 
going over and representing our whole

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:22.220 
going over and representing our whole
team<00:00:20.460> I<00:00:20.820> think<00:00:21.060> it's<00:00:21.330> a<00:00:21.390> huge<00:00:21.600> deal<00:00:21.810> not<00:00:22.080> only

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:22.230 
team I think it's a huge deal not only

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:24.920 
team I think it's a huge deal not only
for<00:00:22.740> us<00:00:22.920> as<00:00:23.220> a<00:00:23.310> forward<00:00:23.789> line<00:00:24.000> because<00:00:24.720> it's

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:24.930 
for us as a forward line because it's

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:26.900 
for us as a forward line because it's
definitely<00:00:25.140> our<00:00:25.710> goal<00:00:26.010> to<00:00:26.400> score<00:00:26.670> many<00:00:26.849> goals

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:26.910 
definitely our goal to score many goals

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:29.720 
definitely our goal to score many goals
and<00:00:27.470> Alex<00:00:28.470> obviously<00:00:28.920> is<00:00:29.130> scoring<00:00:29.490> them<00:00:29.580> at<00:00:29.699> a

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:29.730 
and Alex obviously is scoring them at a

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:31.759 
and Alex obviously is scoring them at a
crazy<00:00:29.910> rate<00:00:30.119> and<00:00:30.480> assisting<00:00:31.289> them<00:00:31.380> at<00:00:31.529> a<00:00:31.590> crazy

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:31.769 
crazy rate and assisting them at a crazy

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:33.889 
crazy rate and assisting them at a crazy
rate<00:00:31.949> so<00:00:32.399> I<00:00:32.669> think<00:00:33.149> the<00:00:33.360> fact<00:00:33.540> that<00:00:33.570> we're<00:00:33.750> both

00:00:33.889 --> 00:00:33.899 
rate so I think the fact that we're both

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:35.690 
rate so I think the fact that we're both
going<00:00:34.200> over<00:00:34.440> there<00:00:34.620> we<00:00:35.100> really<00:00:35.340> want<00:00:35.520> to<00:00:35.579> be

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:35.700 
going over there we really want to be

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:37.340 
going over there we really want to be
representing<00:00:36.270> our<00:00:36.329> entire<00:00:36.630> team<00:00:36.870> because<00:00:37.200> we

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.350 
representing our entire team because we

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:38.869 
representing our entire team because we
know<00:00:37.500> we<00:00:37.620> wouldn't<00:00:37.860> be<00:00:37.920> there<00:00:38.160> or<00:00:38.340> be<00:00:38.640> even

00:00:38.869 --> 00:00:38.879 
know we wouldn't be there or be even

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:40.639 
know we wouldn't be there or be even
nominated<00:00:39.390> for<00:00:39.480> the<00:00:39.570> honor<00:00:39.660> unless<00:00:40.410> we<00:00:40.559> win

00:00:40.639 --> 00:00:40.649 
nominated for the honor unless we win

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:42.080 
nominated for the honor unless we win
gold<00:00:40.890> and<00:00:41.160> the<00:00:41.250> only<00:00:41.370> way<00:00:41.489> we<00:00:41.579> do<00:00:41.700> that<00:00:41.850> so<00:00:42.030> if

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090 
gold and the only way we do that so if

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:43.819 
gold and the only way we do that so if
we<00:00:42.149> have<00:00:42.300> a<00:00:42.600> full<00:00:42.899> team<00:00:43.170> behind<00:00:43.469> us<00:00:43.649> that
