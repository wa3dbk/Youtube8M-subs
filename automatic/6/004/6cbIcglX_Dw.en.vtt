challenging<00:04:09.630> just<00:04:09.780> other<00:04:10.050> youtubers<00:04:10.680> to

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:11.310 
challenging just other youtubers to

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:12.949 
challenging just other youtubers to
games<00:04:11.489> of<00:04:11.640> this<00:04:11.730> probably<00:04:12.060> on<00:04:12.180> a<00:04:12.239> weekly<00:04:12.600> basis

00:04:12.949 --> 00:04:12.959 
games of this probably on a weekly basis

00:04:12.959 --> 00:04:14.240 
games of this probably on a weekly basis
I<00:04:13.050> think<00:04:13.080> is<00:04:13.320> what<00:04:13.500> we<00:04:13.590> were<00:04:13.709> thinking<00:04:13.830> but

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:14.250 
I think is what we were thinking but

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:16.670 
I think is what we were thinking but
might<00:04:14.550> be<00:04:14.700> more<00:04:14.880> frequent<00:04:15.320> and<00:04:16.320> so<00:04:16.440> those<00:04:16.560> will

00:04:16.670 --> 00:04:16.680 
might be more frequent and so those will

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:17.990 
might be more frequent and so those will
be<00:04:16.830> probably<00:04:17.280> close<00:04:17.370> to<00:04:17.700> an<00:04:17.790> hour<00:04:17.880> long

00:04:17.990 --> 00:04:18.000 
be probably close to an hour long

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:19.460 
be probably close to an hour long
episodes<00:04:18.480> as<00:04:18.600> well<00:04:18.630> or<00:04:19.049> maybe<00:04:19.109> a<00:04:19.290> couple

00:04:19.460 --> 00:04:19.470 
episodes as well or maybe a couple

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:21.500 
episodes as well or maybe a couple
half-hour<00:04:19.919> episodes<00:04:20.400> just<00:04:21.180> to<00:04:21.270> make<00:04:21.390> it<00:04:21.419> a

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:21.510 
half-hour episodes just to make it a

00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:22.969 
half-hour episodes just to make it a
little<00:04:21.600> easier<00:04:22.049> to<00:04:22.169> render<00:04:22.440> and<00:04:22.560> upload<00:04:22.590> well

00:04:22.969 --> 00:04:22.979 
little easier to render and upload well

00:04:22.979 --> 00:04:24.500 
little easier to render and upload well
we're<00:04:23.340> figuring<00:04:23.490> out<00:04:23.760> the<00:04:23.850> details<00:04:24.120> on<00:04:24.270> that

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:24.510 
we're figuring out the details on that

00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:26.150 
we're figuring out the details on that
so<00:04:25.110> that's<00:04:25.229> something<00:04:25.470> else<00:04:25.650> to<00:04:25.770> look<00:04:25.919> forward

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:26.160 
so that's something else to look forward

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:27.379 
so that's something else to look forward
to

00:04:27.379 --> 00:04:27.389 
to

00:04:27.389 --> 00:04:29.270 
to
um<00:04:27.509> so<00:04:28.080> that's<00:04:28.139> pretty<00:04:28.740> much<00:04:28.889> what<00:04:29.039> you<00:04:29.129> got

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:29.280 
um so that's pretty much what you got

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:31.249 
um so that's pretty much what you got
for<00:04:29.699> news<00:04:30.330> and<00:04:30.360> updates

00:04:31.249 --> 00:04:31.259 
for news and updates

00:04:31.259 --> 00:04:32.659 
for news and updates
so<00:04:31.379> everything's<00:04:31.770> gonna<00:04:31.919> continue<00:04:32.310> as<00:04:32.430> it<00:04:32.550> is

00:04:32.659 --> 00:04:32.669 
so everything's gonna continue as it is

00:04:32.669 --> 00:04:34.219 
so everything's gonna continue as it is
and<00:04:32.969> you'll<00:04:33.090> probably<00:04:33.210> see<00:04:33.509> some<00:04:33.539> more<00:04:33.900> new

00:05:08.059 --> 00:05:08.069 
egg is actually been part of some

00:05:08.069 --> 00:05:10.969 
egg is actually been part of some
pixelmon<00:05:08.939> for<00:05:09.240> quite<00:05:09.449> a<00:05:09.479> while<00:05:09.830> but<00:05:10.830> there

00:05:10.969 --> 00:05:10.979 
pixelmon for quite a while but there

00:05:10.979 --> 00:05:12.140 
pixelmon for quite a while but there
were<00:05:11.039> some<00:05:11.159> texture<00:05:11.520> issues<00:05:11.759> that<00:05:11.909> made<00:05:12.029> it

00:05:12.140 --> 00:05:12.150 
were some texture issues that made it

00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:16.219 
were some texture issues that made it
not<00:05:12.419> as<00:05:12.659> visible<00:05:13.349> in<00:05:13.830> previous<00:05:14.610> updates<00:05:15.229> so

00:05:16.219 --> 00:05:16.229 
not as visible in previous updates so

00:05:16.229 --> 00:05:18.769 
not as visible in previous updates so
you<00:05:16.949> need<00:05:17.250> any<00:05:17.430> Magikarp<00:05:18.000> and<00:05:18.240> so<00:05:18.449> this<00:05:18.569> is<00:05:18.689> a

00:05:18.769 --> 00:05:18.779 
you need any Magikarp and so this is a

00:05:18.779 --> 00:05:21.890 
you need any Magikarp and so this is a
normal<00:05:18.930> Magikarp<00:05:19.529> and<00:05:20.250> if<00:05:21.210> you<00:05:21.419> light<00:05:21.659> them<00:05:21.839> on

00:05:21.890 --> 00:05:21.900 
normal Magikarp and if you light them on

00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:27.290 
normal Magikarp and if you light them on
fire<00:05:22.050> and<00:05:23.029> douse<00:05:24.029> him<00:05:24.919> then<00:05:25.919> I<00:05:26.219> believe<00:05:26.879> that

00:05:27.290 --> 00:05:27.300 
fire and douse him then I believe that

00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:29.689 
fire and douse him then I believe that
should<00:05:27.360> have<00:05:27.479> been<00:05:27.569> long<00:05:27.749> enough<00:05:28.069> yep<00:05:29.099> and<00:05:29.310> you

00:05:29.689 --> 00:05:29.699 
should have been long enough yep and you

00:05:29.699 --> 00:05:32.029 
should have been long enough yep and you
get<00:05:29.879> a<00:05:29.909> roasted<00:05:30.659> and<00:05:30.779> Magikarp<00:05:31.349> so<00:05:31.560> it<00:05:31.650> stays

00:05:32.029 --> 00:05:32.039 
get a roasted and Magikarp so it stays

00:05:32.039 --> 00:05:33.559 
get a roasted and Magikarp so it stays
with<00:05:32.219> this<00:05:32.370> texture<00:05:32.729> permanently<00:05:33.360> you<00:05:33.449> can

00:05:33.559 --> 00:05:33.569 
with this texture permanently you can

00:05:33.569 --> 00:05:34.850 
with this texture permanently you can
take<00:05:33.689> it<00:05:33.779> in<00:05:33.870> and<00:05:34.020> out<00:05:34.050> of<00:05:34.229> the<00:05:34.289> pokeball<00:05:34.710> and

00:05:34.850 --> 00:05:34.860 
take it in and out of the pokeball and

00:05:34.860 --> 00:05:36.709 
take it in and out of the pokeball and
it'll<00:05:35.009> keep<00:05:35.129> the<00:05:35.310> texture<00:05:35.699> it<00:05:36.270> won't<00:05:36.569> were

00:05:36.709 --> 00:05:36.719 
it'll keep the texture it won't were

00:05:36.719 --> 00:05:38.480 
it'll keep the texture it won't were
tame<00:05:37.020> the<00:05:37.169> roasted<00:05:37.560> texture<00:05:37.919> if<00:05:38.069> you<00:05:38.099> evolve

00:05:38.480 --> 00:05:38.490 
tame the roasted texture if you evolve

00:05:38.490 --> 00:05:41.300 
tame the roasted texture if you evolve
it<00:05:38.580> into<00:05:38.669> a<00:05:38.819> Gyarados<00:05:39.770> but<00:05:40.770> this<00:05:40.919> is<00:05:41.009> kind<00:05:41.189> of<00:05:41.219> a

00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:41.310 
it into a Gyarados but this is kind of a

00:05:41.310 --> 00:05:42.950

cool little thing you could have a level
100<00:05:43.139> roasted<00:05:44.009> Magikarp<00:05:44.639> and<00:05:45.469> it's<00:05:46.469> kind<00:05:46.710> of<00:05:46.770> a

00:05:46.850 --> 00:05:46.860 
100 roasted Magikarp and it's kind of a

00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:49.100 
100 roasted Magikarp and it's kind of a
nice<00:05:47.069> little<00:05:47.339> bonus<00:05:47.879> Easter<00:05:48.449> egg<00:05:48.599> thing<00:05:48.899> that

can have something that distinguishes

00:05:54.479 --> 00:05:55.999 
can have something that distinguishes
your<00:05:54.629> Magikarp<00:05:55.020> a<00:05:55.080> little<00:05:55.259> bit<00:05:55.379> from<00:05:55.560> the<00:05:55.830> rest

00:05:55.999 --> 00:05:56.009

00:05:56.009 --> 00:05:58.850 
your Magikarp a little bit from the rest
of<00:05:56.189> the<00:05:56.370> magikarps<00:05:57.120> on<00:05:57.240> a<00:05:57.270> server<00:05:57.620> and<00:05:58.620> you<00:05:58.680> can

00:05:58.850 --> 00:05:58.860 
of the magikarps on a server and you can

00:05:58.860 --> 00:06:00.769 
of the magikarps on a server and you can
do<00:05:58.919> this<00:05:59.039> with<00:05:59.159> wild<00:05:59.490> ones<00:05:59.729> as<00:05:59.879> well<00:06:00.060> kind<00:06:00.599> of<00:06:00.689> a

00:06:01.909 --> 00:06:01.919 
little harder to push the man it's

00:06:01.919 --> 00:06:03.260 
little harder to push the man it's
easier<00:06:02.129> to<00:06:02.219> capture<00:06:02.550> one<00:06:02.699> and<00:06:02.729> actually<00:06:03.060> throw

00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:03.270
