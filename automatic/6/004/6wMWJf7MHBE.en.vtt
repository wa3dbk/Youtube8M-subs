the<00:00:02.070> image<00:00:02.310> that<00:00:02.490> I'm<00:00:02.610> going<00:00:02.820> to<00:00:02.909> be<00:00:03.000> using<00:00:03.330> in

00:00:03.409 --> 00:00:03.419 
the image that I'm going to be using in

00:00:03.419 --> 00:00:05.690 
the image that I'm going to be using in
this<00:00:03.510> tutorial<00:00:03.570> is<00:00:04.350> a<00:00:04.740> photograph<00:00:05.400> that<00:00:05.640> I

00:00:05.690 --> 00:00:05.700 
this tutorial is a photograph that I

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:08.690 
this tutorial is a photograph that I
took<00:00:05.759> while<00:00:06.240> in<00:00:06.390> Tucson<00:00:06.839> Arizona<00:00:07.049> if<00:00:07.649> you<00:00:08.220> want

00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:08.700 
took while in Tucson Arizona if you want

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:10.370 
took while in Tucson Arizona if you want
to<00:00:08.790> follow<00:00:08.910> along<00:00:09.030> with<00:00:09.420> this<00:00:09.540> tutorial<00:00:09.750> using

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:10.380 
to follow along with this tutorial using

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:12.740 
to follow along with this tutorial using
the<00:00:10.469> exact<00:00:10.800> same<00:00:10.830> image<00:00:11.370> that<00:00:11.550> I'm<00:00:11.730> using<00:00:12.000> you

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:12.750 
the exact same image that I'm using you

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:14.180 
the exact same image that I'm using you
can<00:00:12.900> download<00:00:13.170> it<00:00:13.469> from<00:00:13.590> the<00:00:13.710> link<00:00:13.740> I<00:00:14.040> provided

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:14.190 
can download it from the link I provided

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:17.570 
can download it from the link I provided
in<00:00:14.759> the<00:00:14.880> description<00:00:16.100> so<00:00:17.100> the<00:00:17.190> first<00:00:17.400> thing

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:17.580 
in the description so the first thing

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:19.550 
in the description so the first thing
I'm<00:00:17.699> going<00:00:17.850> to<00:00:17.970> do<00:00:18.180> before<00:00:18.600> anything<00:00:18.900> else<00:00:19.260> is

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:19.560 
I'm going to do before anything else is

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:22.099 
I'm going to do before anything else is
blur<00:00:20.130> the<00:00:20.369> image<00:00:20.400> and<00:00:20.880> the<00:00:21.359> reason<00:00:21.660> why<00:00:21.779> I<00:00:21.810> do

00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:22.109 
blur the image and the reason why I do

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:24.439 
blur the image and the reason why I do
that<00:00:22.289> is<00:00:22.560> because<00:00:22.800> it<00:00:23.400> helps<00:00:23.760> remove<00:00:23.910> some<00:00:24.359> of

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:24.449 
that is because it helps remove some of

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:27.380 
that is because it helps remove some of
the<00:00:24.539> fine<00:00:24.810> detail<00:00:25.320> and<00:00:25.670> it<00:00:26.670> makes<00:00:26.910> the<00:00:27.060> edges

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:27.390 
the fine detail and it makes the edges

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:30.050 
the fine detail and it makes the edges
smoother<00:00:27.930> in<00:00:28.140> the<00:00:28.529> stencils<00:00:28.830> which<00:00:29.699> i<00:00:30.000> think

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:30.060 
smoother in the stencils which i think

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:31.820 
smoother in the stencils which i think
makes<00:00:30.390> the<00:00:30.599> image<00:00:30.900> look<00:00:30.929> a<00:00:31.439> little<00:00:31.560> more

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:31.830 
makes the image look a little more

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:36.740 
makes the image look a little more
artistic<00:00:32.840> so<00:00:33.840> I'm<00:00:34.230> gonna<00:00:34.829> go<00:00:35.070> to<00:00:35.130> filters<00:00:36.000> blur

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750 
artistic so I'm gonna go to filters blur

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:44.930 
artistic so I'm gonna go to filters blur
Gaussian<00:00:37.500> blur<00:00:38.870> and<00:00:39.870> just<00:00:40.800> click<00:00:41.070> OK<00:00:43.879> now<00:00:44.879> you

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 
Gaussian blur and just click OK now you

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:46.549 
Gaussian blur and just click OK now you
may<00:00:45.180> not<00:00:45.360> even<00:00:45.510> notice<00:00:45.899> a<00:00:45.989> change<00:00:46.260> in<00:00:46.469> the

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:46.559 
may not even notice a change in the

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:48.380 
may not even notice a change in the
image<00:00:46.770> after<00:00:46.950> you<00:00:47.190> blur<00:00:47.460> but<00:00:47.730> it<00:00:47.879> does<00:00:48.059> make<00:00:48.360> a

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390 
image after you blur but it does make a

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:51.350 
image after you blur but it does make a
big<00:00:48.480> difference<00:00:48.660> in<00:00:49.260> the<00:00:49.320> final<00:00:49.500> product<00:00:50.360> so

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360 
big difference in the final product so

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:53.600 
big difference in the final product so
the<00:00:51.539> next<00:00:51.719> step<00:00:52.020> is<00:00:52.260> to<00:00:52.739> duplicate<00:00:53.399> this<00:00:53.550> layer

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
the next step is to duplicate this layer

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:56.000 
the next step is to duplicate this layer
two<00:00:54.149> more<00:00:54.360> times<00:00:54.629> and<00:00:54.989> the<00:00:55.410> reason<00:00:55.710> I<00:00:55.770> do<00:00:55.829> that

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
two more times and the reason I do that

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:58.010 
two more times and the reason I do that
is<00:00:56.190> because<00:00:56.760> I<00:00:56.910> want<00:00:57.090> to<00:00:57.120> have<00:00:57.270> three<00:00:57.660> separate

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020 
is because I want to have three separate

00:00:58.020 --> 00:00:59.930 
is because I want to have three separate
layers<00:00:58.230> of<00:00:58.469> color<00:00:58.739> and<00:00:59.070> then<00:00:59.640> a<00:00:59.670> white

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
layers of color and then a white

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:02.990 
layers of color and then a white
background<00:01:00.239> and<00:01:00.980> you<00:01:01.980> need<00:01:02.160> a<00:01:02.399> separate<00:01:02.760> layer

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
background and you need a separate layer

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.299 
background and you need a separate layer
for<00:01:03.030> each<00:01:03.449> color<00:01:03.780> because<00:01:04.379> I'm<00:01:04.769> going<00:01:04.949> to<00:01:05.070> be

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
for each color because I'm going to be

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:09.469 
for each color because I'm going to be
using<00:01:05.850> the<00:01:05.970> threshold<00:01:07.280> tool<00:01:08.280> on<00:01:08.610> each<00:01:09.150> layer

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
using the threshold tool on each layer

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:12.830 
using the threshold tool on each layer
but<00:01:09.780> with<00:01:09.900> a<00:01:09.930> different<00:01:10.380> value<00:01:11.540> so<00:01:12.540> I'm<00:01:12.630> just

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
but with a different value so I'm just

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:16.039 
but with a different value so I'm just
gonna<00:01:12.930> click<00:01:13.170> duplicate<00:01:14.630> okay<00:01:15.630> so<00:01:15.689> now<00:01:16.020> that

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049 
gonna click duplicate okay so now that

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:17.960 
gonna click duplicate okay so now that
I've<00:01:16.259> got<00:01:16.470> my<00:01:16.619> three<00:01:16.950> layers<00:01:17.220> I'm<00:01:17.520> gonna<00:01:17.700> focus

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970 
I've got my three layers I'm gonna focus

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:21.499 
I've got my three layers I'm gonna focus
on<00:01:18.390> this<00:01:18.750> first<00:01:19.140> layer<00:01:19.380> the<00:01:19.650> bottom<00:01:19.830> layer<00:01:20.509> I'm

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509 
on this first layer the bottom layer I'm

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:26.810 
on this first layer the bottom layer I'm
gonna<00:01:21.659> go<00:01:21.869> to<00:01:21.930> colors<00:01:23.090> threshold<00:01:25.700> now<00:01:26.700> if

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
gonna go to colors threshold now if

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:28.340 
gonna go to colors threshold now if
you've<00:01:26.939> never<00:01:27.000> used<00:01:27.240> threshold<00:01:27.930> before<00:01:28.320> I

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
you've never used threshold before I

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:30.170 
you've never used threshold before I
suggest<00:01:28.950> playing<00:01:29.220> and<00:01:29.460> playing<00:01:29.820> around<00:01:29.939> with

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180 
suggest playing and playing around with

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:31.940 
suggest playing and playing around with
it<00:01:30.420> for<00:01:30.450> a<00:01:30.750> little<00:01:30.869> bit<00:01:31.110> you<00:01:31.500> can<00:01:31.680> kind<00:01:31.890> of

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
it for a little bit you can kind of

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:35.480 
it for a little bit you can kind of
figure<00:01:32.159> out<00:01:32.369> what<00:01:32.520> it<00:01:32.640> does<00:01:34.070> but<00:01:35.070> you<00:01:35.130> don't

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
figure out what it does but you don't

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:36.530 
figure out what it does but you don't
really<00:01:35.700> need<00:01:35.820> to<00:01:35.939> have<00:01:36.060> a<00:01:36.119> deep<00:01:36.390> understanding

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:36.540 
really need to have a deep understanding

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:39.380 
really need to have a deep understanding
of<00:01:37.170> thresholds<00:01:37.950> in<00:01:38.070> order<00:01:38.400> to<00:01:38.610> make<00:01:38.970> a<00:01:39.000> really

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.390 
of thresholds in order to make a really

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:42.380 
of thresholds in order to make a really
nice<00:01:39.540> stencil<00:01:40.079> image<00:01:40.380> so<00:01:40.970> what<00:01:41.970> I'm<00:01:42.090> going<00:01:42.270> to

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
nice stencil image so what I'm going to

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:45.889 
nice stencil image so what I'm going to
do<00:01:42.630> is<00:01:42.930> just<00:01:43.490> move<00:01:44.490> my<00:01:44.700> cursor<00:01:44.970> around<00:01:45.180> until<00:01:45.869> I

00:01:45.889 --> 00:01:45.899 
do is just move my cursor around until I

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:48.710 
do is just move my cursor around until I
find<00:01:46.259> a<00:01:46.530> suitable<00:01:47.159> image<00:01:47.430> that<00:01:47.850> I<00:01:47.880> like<00:01:48.210> and

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:48.720 
find a suitable image that I like and

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:50.090 
find a suitable image that I like and
you'll<00:01:48.869> notice<00:01:49.110> that<00:01:49.409> if<00:01:49.590> I<00:01:49.680> put<00:01:49.950> my<00:01:50.070> cursor

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100 
you'll notice that if I put my cursor

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:53.270 
you'll notice that if I put my cursor
over<00:01:50.460> here<00:01:51.030> on<00:01:51.180> this<00:01:51.540> peak<00:01:51.960> I<00:01:52.259> get<00:01:53.070> all<00:01:53.159> these

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 
over here on this peak I get all these

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:55.100 
over here on this peak I get all these
little<00:01:53.430> details<00:01:54.000> in<00:01:54.180> the<00:01:54.270> gravel<00:01:54.659> road<00:01:54.869> I

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:55.110 
little details in the gravel road I

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:56.630 
little details in the gravel road I
don't<00:01:55.350> really<00:01:55.619> want<00:01:55.860> that<00:01:56.040> level<00:01:56.219> of<00:01:56.460> detail

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
don't really want that level of detail

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:58.550 
don't really want that level of detail
in<00:01:56.969> this<00:01:57.060> image<00:01:57.420> so<00:01:57.719> I'm<00:01:57.930> gonna<00:01:58.049> move<00:01:58.290> the

00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:58.560 
in this image so I'm gonna move the

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:01.249 
in this image so I'm gonna move the
slider<00:01:58.860> over<00:01:59.369> here<00:01:59.759> to<00:02:00.420> the<00:02:00.540> value<00:02:00.869> of<00:02:00.899> about

00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:01.259 
slider over here to the value of about

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:05.090 
slider over here to the value of about
91<00:02:02.509> and<00:02:03.509> you'll<00:02:03.630> see<00:02:03.840> that<00:02:04.049> that's<00:02:04.530> left<00:02:04.920> the

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:05.100 
91 and you'll see that that's left the

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:07.910 
91 and you'll see that that's left the
gravel<00:02:05.520> road<00:02:05.729> as<00:02:06.149> just<00:02:06.570> a<00:02:06.659> nice<00:02:06.930> white<00:02:07.439> blank

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:07.920 
gravel road as just a nice white blank

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:10.760 
gravel road as just a nice white blank
surface<00:02:08.629> so<00:02:09.629> that<00:02:09.959> looks<00:02:10.110> pretty<00:02:10.170> good<00:02:10.379> so<00:02:10.530> I'm

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:10.770 
surface so that looks pretty good so I'm

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:13.430 
surface so that looks pretty good so I'm
just<00:02:10.950> gonna<00:02:11.039> click<00:02:11.370> OK

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:16.080 
and now I'm going to add some color to

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:19.220 
and now I'm going to add some color to
this<00:02:16.380> layer<00:02:16.760> so<00:02:17.760> for<00:02:18.390> this<00:02:18.480> bottom<00:02:18.840> layer<00:02:18.990> I'm

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:19.230 
this layer so for this bottom layer I'm

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:22.550 
this layer so for this bottom layer I'm
gonna<00:02:19.380> go<00:02:19.590> with<00:02:19.890> a<00:02:20.280> nice<00:02:21.180> light<00:02:21.750> blue<00:02:22.050> kind<00:02:22.500> of

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:25.830 
a sky blue I'm gonna use my select by

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:27.860 
a sky blue I'm gonna use my select by
color<00:02:26.040> tool<00:02:26.190> select<00:02:27.150> everything<00:02:27.510> that's

black and then fill it in with blue okay
now<00:02:35.760> the<00:02:35.820> next<00:02:36.270> step<00:02:36.510> this<00:02:36.780> one<00:02:36.930> is<00:02:37.050> very

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:37.320 
now the next step this one is very

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:39.260 
now the next step this one is very
important<00:02:37.860> I'm<00:02:38.010> going<00:02:38.310> to<00:02:38.400> select<00:02:38.700> all<00:02:38.970> of<00:02:39.030> the

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:39.270 
important I'm going to select all of the

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:44.330 
important I'm going to select all of the
white<00:02:39.450> space<00:02:39.480> and<00:02:40.110> just<00:02:41.100> delete<00:02:41.430> it<00:02:43.160> so<00:02:44.160> there

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:44.340 
white space and just delete it so there

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:45.950 
white space and just delete it so there
you<00:02:44.460> have<00:02:44.490> it<00:02:44.700> there's<00:02:45.030> your<00:02:45.210> first<00:02:45.480> layer<00:02:45.720> I

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:45.960 
you have it there's your first layer I

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:47.540 
you have it there's your first layer I
know<00:02:46.380> it<00:02:46.590> doesn't<00:02:46.770> look<00:02:46.920> like<00:02:47.070> much<00:02:47.520> but

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:47.550 
know it doesn't look like much but

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:49.760 
know it doesn't look like much but
you'll<00:02:48.330> see<00:02:48.540> it<00:02:48.690> all<00:02:48.780> come<00:02:49.080> together<00:02:49.260> at<00:02:49.620> the

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:49.770 
you'll see it all come together at the

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:52.130 
you'll see it all come together at the
end<00:02:49.880> so<00:02:50.880> I'm<00:02:50.970> going<00:02:51.090> to<00:02:51.120> move<00:02:51.240> on<00:02:51.420> to<00:02:51.570> my<00:02:51.690> second

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:52.140 
end so I'm going to move on to my second

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:55.700 
end so I'm going to move on to my second
layer<00:02:52.290> use<00:02:53.250> the<00:02:53.520> exact<00:02:53.940> same<00:02:53.970> process<00:02:54.870> except

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:55.710 
layer use the exact same process except

00:02:55.710 --> 00:02:57.920 
layer use the exact same process except
I'm<00:02:56.640> going<00:02:56.700> to<00:02:56.850> use<00:02:56.970> a<00:02:57.000> different<00:02:57.360> threshold

00:02:57.920 --> 00:02:57.930 
I'm going to use a different threshold

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:00.080 
I'm going to use a different threshold
value<00:02:58.290> so<00:02:58.530> for<00:02:58.830> my<00:02:58.920> first<00:02:59.190> one<00:02:59.430> and<00:02:59.670> had<00:03:00.060> a

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:00.090 
value so for my first one and had a

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:03.290 
value so for my first one and had a
value<00:03:00.510> of<00:03:00.540> about<00:03:00.770> 90<00:03:01.790> something<00:03:02.790> like<00:03:03.060> that

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:03.300 
value of about 90 something like that

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:05.450 
value of about 90 something like that
but<00:03:04.110> this<00:03:04.260> one<00:03:04.470> I'm<00:03:04.620> gonna<00:03:04.710> move<00:03:04.980> the<00:03:05.160> slider

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:05.460 
but this one I'm gonna move the slider

00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:09.860 
but this one I'm gonna move the slider
over<00:03:05.940> here<00:03:07.550> and<00:03:08.550> I'm<00:03:09.270> gonna<00:03:09.420> go<00:03:09.570> with<00:03:09.750> the

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:09.870 
over here and I'm gonna go with the

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:16.570 
over here and I'm gonna go with the
value<00:03:10.380> of<00:03:10.560> about<00:03:11.810> 54<00:03:12.810> that<00:03:13.020> looks<00:03:13.200> pretty<00:03:13.380> good

00:03:16.570 --> 00:03:16.580 

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:18.620 

so<00:03:17.580> now<00:03:17.700> I'm<00:03:17.730> going<00:03:17.940> to<00:03:18.120> select<00:03:18.330> everything

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:18.630 
so now I'm going to select everything

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:22.730 
so now I'm going to select everything
that's<00:03:19.080> black<00:03:19.440> and<00:03:20.420> this<00:03:21.420> layer<00:03:21.780> is<00:03:22.140> going<00:03:22.620> to

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:22.740 
that's black and this layer is going to

00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:27.290 
that's black and this layer is going to
be<00:03:22.890> kind<00:03:23.730> of<00:03:23.760> a<00:03:23.880> darker<00:03:24.360> blue<00:03:24.750> or<00:03:25.190> more<00:03:26.190> so<00:03:26.430> gray

I'm<00:03:35.100> gonna<00:03:35.220> select<00:03:35.490> all<00:03:35.820> the<00:03:35.970> white<00:03:36.150> space<00:03:36.330> and

00:03:37.070 --> 00:03:37.080 
I'm gonna select all the white space and

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:43.400 
I'm gonna select all the white space and
delete<00:03:37.590> it<00:03:41.120> and<00:03:42.120> now<00:03:42.270> onto<00:03:42.690> my<00:03:42.810> last<00:03:43.080> layer

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:43.410 
delete it and now onto my last layer

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:50.960 
delete it and now onto my last layer
same<00:03:43.860> process<00:03:44.489> color<00:03:45.500> threshold<00:03:49.220> and<00:03:50.220> for

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:50.970 
same process color threshold and for

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:54.410 
same process color threshold and for
this<00:03:51.120> one<00:03:51.480> I<00:03:52.489> just<00:03:53.489> want<00:03:53.640> to<00:03:53.700> have<00:03:53.790> the<00:03:53.910> finest

gonna<00:04:04.110> click<00:04:04.380> OK<00:04:04.830> and<00:04:07.340> this<00:04:08.340> layer<00:04:08.580> I'm<00:04:08.850> just

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:08.880 
gonna click OK and this layer I'm just

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:10.880 
gonna click OK and this layer I'm just
gonna<00:04:09.120> leave<00:04:09.330> it<00:04:09.480> black<00:04:09.720> that<00:04:10.560> looks<00:04:10.739> pretty

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:10.890 
gonna leave it black that looks pretty

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:12.979

good<00:04:11.030> I'm<00:04:12.030> going<00:04:12.150> to<00:04:12.209> select<00:04:12.390> all<00:04:12.690> the<00:04:12.810> white

00:04:12.979 --> 00:04:12.989 
good I'm going to select all the white

00:04:12.989 --> 00:04:17.920 
good I'm going to select all the white
space<00:04:13.170> and<00:04:13.650> then<00:04:14.130> delete<00:04:14.550> it<00:04:14.700> once<00:04:15.060> again<00:04:15.180> now

each<00:04:18.930> of<00:04:18.959> these<00:04:19.169> layers<00:04:19.500> doesn't<00:04:20.040> really<00:04:20.160> look

00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:20.370 
each of these layers doesn't really look

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:22.670 
each of these layers doesn't really look
like<00:04:20.609> too<00:04:20.790> much<00:04:20.989> but<00:04:21.989> when<00:04:22.109> you<00:04:22.140> add<00:04:22.380> them<00:04:22.530> all

00:04:22.670 --> 00:04:22.680 
like too much but when you add them all

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:24.860 
like too much but when you add them all
together<00:04:22.919> you<00:04:23.460> get<00:04:24.270> a<00:04:24.330> pretty<00:04:24.600> nice-looking
