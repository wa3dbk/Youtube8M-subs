00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:04.589
 Welcome to LZH in the online-shop of LÃ¼demann and Sakkara 

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:08.989
 Percent we have already shown in another video 

00:00:08.989 --> 00:00:11.549
 is there a Renault Sport 

00:00:11.549 --> 00:00:13.689
 Sheikh Knauf 5-speed 

00:00:13.689 --> 00:00:16.689
 Of course we do not want to give up the fight 

00:00:17.269 --> 00:00:19.970
 Of course, these are missing here below 

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:21.470
 the extension 

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:24.819
 the band 5-gang, however, has this one too 

00:00:24.819 --> 00:00:26.509
 accordingly give them courage 

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:29.289
 in order to keep in Schweighof 

00:00:29.289 --> 00:00:32.320
 Unilever quartz passage Tebbe record 

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:36.280
 that's important because otherwise it does not work 

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:39.490
 Sorbs assembly is relatively easy 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:43.910
 you have to spend a bit of power around this shift knob now 

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:45.160
 abzubekommen 

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:48.160
 you should pull it off as straight as possible 

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:52.270
 possible the second gear from the driver's side 

00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:53.430
 and 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:56.780
 Attention must be given security iPad Rock not that one yourself 

00:00:56.780 --> 00:00:57.930
 somehow 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:00.530
 the hands in the face skin or the like 

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:04.020
 I'm trying this for the first time before for the first time 

00:01:04.020 --> 00:01:06.100
 and that's why Oracle and square 

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:08.020
 and there it is 

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:10.620
 the spring sometimes falls away 

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:13.470
 there you have to be careful a bit the whole is then 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:16.470
 also quite relaxed here, the spring back in 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:21.450
 this is the standard gear knob 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:25.050
 and the crisis then swapped relatively quickly by the Renault Sport 

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:27.200
 shuccle room 

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:28.870
 put on 

00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:31.740
 I'm not making it on purpose now because 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:35.060
 he sits rock solid and then I have the problem I had to go back 

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:38.990
 I do not want to pull that off so often and make new vehicle like this 

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:40.160
 Evening is 

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:43.000
 and that is not so good 

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:44.760
 was modest 

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:47.190
 Ben Bernanke were 

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:50.550
 Reverse lock is picked up by the shift knob 

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:55.000
 100 percent compatible if I hit it right now 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:58.620
 then this shift knob is absolutely bombproof 

00:01:58.620 --> 00:02:00.420
 on the shift linkage 

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:03.420
 at around 17 well off course, of course, accordingly 

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:08.450
 to mitigation from the Nikon 3 Sheikh race then accordingly for all 

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:09.749
 Six-speed transmission 

00:02:09.749 --> 00:02:12.819
 I convert especially the standard increases again 

00:02:13.949 --> 00:02:15.979
 Hertha already entertained 

00:02:15.979 --> 00:02:21.239
 and on it 8 that was s -h and that's how it works with the Renault 

00:02:21.239 --> 00:02:22.319
 Sport gear knob 

00:02:22.319 --> 00:02:23.150
 until then too 

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:26.410
 Opel, she must now again and I pull hard around this again 

00:02:26.409 --> 00:02:27.549
 abzubekommen 

00:02:27.549 --> 00:02:31.029
 Percent blinkers Skinner blasts compatible to all 

00:02:31.029 --> 00:02:34.029
 nine renault models 

00:02:34.659 --> 00:02:37.049
 Cleo and 3 

00:02:37.049 --> 00:02:39.529
 I also believe a six-speed transmission 

00:02:39.529 --> 00:02:42.699
 then we would still have percent Simic 3 

00:02:42.699 --> 00:02:44.739
 do you have it up accordingly? 

00:02:44.739 --> 00:02:49.730
 yes i noticed two Laguna 3 for example when you dry it around 

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:51.369
 and here arises 

00:02:51.369 --> 00:02:55.260
 in the lower part a light candidate you can see the suspension 

00:02:55.879 --> 00:02:58.879
 It does not like everything everyone is Miltner light 

00:02:59.399 --> 00:03:00.949
 percent 

00:03:00.949 --> 00:03:04.309
 the clients still knew visible while mounting this 

00:03:04.309 --> 00:03:05.999
 Six-speed connection to buy 

00:03:05.999 --> 00:03:09.789
 I just say that in advance because some schools often go for it 

00:03:09.789 --> 00:03:11.899
 Laguna have set up three 

00:03:11.899 --> 00:03:15.079
 Of course, that did not like it then 

00:03:15.079 --> 00:03:18.029
 there is something else visible around them 

00:03:18.029 --> 00:03:24.139
 definitely at the liga- and three at Clio 3 as well as nods around them 3 

00:03:24.729 --> 00:03:28.759
 is not at all to see anything so 100 percent compatible with this 

00:03:28.759 --> 00:03:32.859
 Part I hope I could help with this video accordingly that 

00:03:32.859 --> 00:03:36.959
 You can see how fast and easy you can get the interior of a vehicle 

00:03:36.959 --> 00:03:38.899
 optical drive can 

00:03:38.899 --> 00:03:39.769
 have a nice day
