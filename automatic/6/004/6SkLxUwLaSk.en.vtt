here<00:00:53.810> I'm<00:00:53.960> trying

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:54.530 
here I'm trying

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:57.850 
here I'm trying
just<00:00:54.890> a<00:00:55.040> regular<00:00:55.190> stain<00:00:55.730> fed<00:00:56.350> the<00:00:57.350> ink<00:00:57.560> and

00:00:57.850 --> 00:00:57.860 
just a regular stain fed the ink and

00:00:57.860 --> 00:01:00.760 
just a regular stain fed the ink and

hard to clean off your fingers it's very

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:06.760 
hard to clean off your fingers it's very
messy<00:01:03.680> I<00:01:04.449> would<00:01:05.449> not<00:01:05.630> recommend<00:01:05.840> using<00:01:06.470> this

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:06.770 
messy I would not recommend using this

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:12.160 
messy I would not recommend using this
on<00:01:07.070> babies<00:01:07.580> or<00:01:07.850> young<00:01:07.910> children<00:01:10.660> it<00:01:11.660> does<00:01:11.870> give

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:12.170 
on babies or young children it does give

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:15.490 
on babies or young children it does give
a<00:01:12.200> fairly<00:01:12.530> clean<00:01:12.979> print<00:01:13.370> though<00:01:13.960> so<00:01:14.960> if<00:01:15.350> you

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:15.500 
a fairly clean print though so if you

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:17.230 
a fairly clean print though so if you
haven't<00:01:15.650> got<00:01:15.860> anything<00:01:16.130> else<00:01:16.490> and<00:01:16.729> it's<00:01:16.880> for

00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:17.240 
haven't got anything else and it's for

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:20.170 
haven't got anything else and it's for
an<00:01:17.330> adult<00:01:17.600> I<00:01:17.900> wouldn't<00:01:18.380> mind<00:01:18.560> using<00:01:18.830> it<00:01:19.180> you'll

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:20.180 
an adult I wouldn't mind using it you'll

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:21.999 
an adult I wouldn't mind using it you'll
need<00:01:20.450> some<00:01:20.780> solvent<00:01:21.290> to<00:01:21.410> clean<00:01:21.680> off<00:01:21.830> your

00:01:21.999 --> 00:01:22.009 
need some solvent to clean off your

00:01:22.009 --> 00:01:24.850 
need some solvent to clean off your
hands<00:01:22.340> so<00:01:22.540> just<00:01:23.540> a<00:01:23.660> baby<00:01:23.840> wipe<00:01:24.110> will<00:01:24.350> not<00:01:24.530> do<00:01:24.710> it

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:24.860 
hands so just a baby wipe will not do it

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:33.969 
hands so just a baby wipe will not do it
a<00:01:31.060> much<00:01:32.060> better<00:01:32.300> option<00:01:32.600> is<00:01:33.170> a<00:01:33.229> pigment<00:01:33.800> ink

00:01:33.969 --> 00:01:33.979 
a much better option is a pigment ink

00:01:33.979 --> 00:01:37.060 
a much better option is a pigment ink
pad<00:01:34.780> instead<00:01:35.780> of<00:01:36.020> a<00:01:36.110> dye<00:01:36.320> which<00:01:36.650> really

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:37.070 
pad instead of a dye which really

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:39.310 
pad instead of a dye which really
attaches<00:01:37.610> to<00:01:37.820> the<00:01:37.940> skin<00:01:38.240> the<00:01:38.600> pigment<00:01:39.080> wipes

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:39.320 
attaches to the skin the pigment wipes

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:42.969 
attaches to the skin the pigment wipes
off<00:01:39.590> quite<00:01:39.890> easily<00:01:41.320> most<00:01:42.320> of<00:01:42.500> it<00:01:42.619> will<00:01:42.800> come

00:01:42.969 --> 00:01:42.979 
off quite easily most of it will come

00:01:42.979 --> 00:01:45.520 
off quite easily most of it will come
off<00:01:43.160> with<00:01:43.340> a<00:01:43.399> baby<00:01:43.640> wipe<00:01:44.020> if<00:01:45.020> there's<00:01:45.320> a<00:01:45.380> little
