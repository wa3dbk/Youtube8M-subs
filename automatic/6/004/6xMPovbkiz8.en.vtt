you up because you don't have to go back

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:05.990 
you up because you don't have to go back
and<00:00:04.950> look<00:00:05.069> at<00:00:05.190> your<00:00:05.220> pattern<00:00:05.460> over<00:00:05.819> and<00:00:05.850> over

00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:06.000 
and look at your pattern over and over

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.059 
and look at your pattern over and over
again<00:00:06.210> so<00:00:06.509> first<00:00:07.350> I'm<00:00:07.529> going<00:00:07.649> to<00:00:07.740> show<00:00:07.830> you<00:00:07.859> how

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:09.980 
again so first I'm going to show you how
to<00:00:08.130> keep<00:00:08.340> track<00:00:08.550> of<00:00:08.580> your<00:00:08.820> rows<00:00:09.059> let's<00:00:09.719> say<00:00:09.870> our

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:09.990 
to keep track of your rows let's say our

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:13.730 
to keep track of your rows let's say our
pattern<00:00:10.349> says<00:00:11.059> you<00:00:12.059> knit<00:00:12.210> five<00:00:12.480> rows<00:00:12.780> from

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:13.740 
pattern says you knit five rows from

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:16.580 
pattern says you knit five rows from
here<00:00:14.599> slipping<00:00:15.599> the<00:00:15.690> first<00:00:15.719> steps<00:00:16.170> like<00:00:16.350> I<00:00:16.440> was

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:16.590 
here slipping the first steps like I was

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:19.460 
here slipping the first steps like I was
like<00:00:16.740> to<00:00:16.890> do<00:00:16.949> keeps<00:00:17.789> the<00:00:17.910> edge<00:00:18.029> nice<00:00:18.470> we're

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:19.470 
like to do keeps the edge nice we're

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:20.630 
like to do keeps the edge nice we're
going<00:00:19.590> to<00:00:19.650> start<00:00:19.800> to<00:00:19.859> knit<00:00:20.039> so<00:00:20.189> this<00:00:20.340> is<00:00:20.490> going

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:20.640 
going to start to knit so this is going

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:26.390 
going to start to knit so this is going
to<00:00:20.699> be<00:00:20.880> row<00:00:21.480> number<00:00:21.900> one<00:00:25.039> as<00:00:26.039> we're<00:00:26.250> knitting

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:26.400 
to be row number one as we're knitting

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:27.890 
to be row number one as we're knitting
row<00:00:26.580> number<00:00:26.820> one<00:00:26.970> I'm<00:00:27.090> going<00:00:27.240> to<00:00:27.330> put<00:00:27.480> a<00:00:27.510> marker

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:27.900 
row number one I'm going to put a marker

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:32.120 
row number one I'm going to put a marker
right<00:00:28.500> in<00:00:28.769> row<00:00:29.070> number<00:00:29.279> one<00:00:29.609> so<00:00:30.210> that<00:00:30.390> I<00:00:30.420> can<00:00:31.130> so

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:32.130 
right in row number one so that I can so

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:34.430 
right in row number one so that I can so
that<00:00:32.160> I<00:00:32.309> can<00:00:32.550> recognize<00:00:32.910> it<00:00:33.300> as<00:00:33.450> I<00:00:34.020> knit<00:00:34.230> so

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:34.440 
that I can recognize it as I knit so

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:35.600 
that I can recognize it as I knit so
that<00:00:34.559> it<00:00:34.649> will<00:00:34.710> be<00:00:34.829> really<00:00:35.070> easy<00:00:35.100> for<00:00:35.399> me<00:00:35.460> to

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:35.610 
that it will be really easy for me to

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:37.069 
that it will be really easy for me to
count<00:00:35.790> my<00:00:35.910> five<00:00:36.120> rows<00:00:36.390> so<00:00:36.600> this<00:00:36.750> is<00:00:36.899> how<00:00:37.020> I'm

00:00:37.069 --> 00:00:37.079 
count my five rows so this is how I'm

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:39.530 
count my five rows so this is how I'm
going<00:00:37.170> to<00:00:37.290> put<00:00:37.410> a<00:00:37.440> marker<00:00:37.770> in<00:00:38.090> all<00:00:39.090> the<00:00:39.420> way

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:39.540 
going to put a marker in all the way

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:41.510 
going to put a marker in all the way
around<00:00:39.899> just<00:00:40.170> any<00:00:40.350> stitch<00:00:40.649> in<00:00:40.770> this<00:00:40.890> row<00:00:41.100> all

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:41.520 
around just any stitch in this row all

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:44.240 
around just any stitch in this row all
the<00:00:41.969> way<00:00:42.090> around<00:00:42.530> the<00:00:43.530> stitch<00:00:43.770> on<00:00:44.010> the<00:00:44.160> needle

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:44.250 
the way around the stitch on the needle

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:49.000 
the way around the stitch on the needle
itself<00:00:44.670> so<00:00:45.210> let's<00:00:45.329> get<00:00:45.539> better<00:00:45.809> look<00:00:46.020> at<00:00:46.140> that

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:49.010 

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:58.400 

around<00:00:50.010> the<00:00:50.160> back<00:00:50.840> like<00:00:51.840> that

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:58.410 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:00.620 

see<00:00:58.950> if<00:00:59.040> that's<00:00:59.190> all<00:00:59.400> the<00:00:59.550> way<00:00:59.610> around<00:00:59.910> that

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:00.630 
see if that's all the way around that

00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:04.549 
see if that's all the way around that
loop<00:01:00.810> right<00:01:01.020> there<00:01:02.870> as<00:01:03.870> close<00:01:04.080> as<00:01:04.199> I<00:01:04.260> can<00:01:04.320> get

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
loop right there as close as I can get

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:07.730 
loop right there as close as I can get
to<00:01:04.620> the<00:01:04.800> needle<00:01:05.300> there<00:01:06.320> so<00:01:07.320> I'm<00:01:07.410> going<00:01:07.530> to<00:01:07.620> show

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
to the needle there so I'm going to show

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:08.930 
to the needle there so I'm going to show
you<00:01:07.800> what<00:01:07.979> that<00:01:08.010> looks<00:01:08.310> like<00:01:08.370> as<00:01:08.610> we<00:01:08.760> keep

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:08.940 
you what that looks like as we keep

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:10.880 
you what that looks like as we keep
knitting<00:01:09.240> I'm<00:01:09.900> going<00:01:10.080> to<00:01:10.140> show<00:01:10.260> you<00:01:10.350> what<00:01:10.800> it

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
knitting I'm going to show you what it

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:12.680 
knitting I'm going to show you what it
looks<00:01:11.070> like<00:01:11.220> once<00:01:11.729> I<00:01:11.880> need<00:01:11.940> a<00:01:12.090> few<00:01:12.330> more<00:01:12.479> rows

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:12.690 
looks like once I need a few more rows

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:14.719 
looks like once I need a few more rows
and<00:01:12.930> how<00:01:12.990> easy<00:01:13.290> it<00:01:13.470> is<00:01:13.560> to<00:01:13.770> count<00:01:14.010> once<00:01:14.550> you've

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729 
and how easy it is to count once you've

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:17.960 
and how easy it is to count once you've
got<00:01:14.880> your<00:01:14.910> marker<00:01:15.330> in<00:01:15.420> like<00:01:15.600> that<00:01:16.970> I've

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970 
got your marker in like that I've

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:19.760 
got your marker in like that I've
continued<00:01:18.600> knitting<00:01:18.900> a<00:01:18.990> few<00:01:19.229> more<00:01:19.410> rows<00:01:19.560> I

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
continued knitting a few more rows I

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:20.990 
continued knitting a few more rows I
don't<00:01:19.920> really<00:01:20.070> know<00:01:20.220> how<00:01:20.340> many<00:01:20.580> so<00:01:20.820> let's

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000 
don't really know how many so let's

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:21.859 
don't really know how many so let's
count<00:01:21.240> okay

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:21.869 
count okay

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:23.840 
count okay
so<00:01:22.229> here<00:01:22.590> is<00:01:22.770> our<00:01:22.890> marker<00:01:23.280> and<00:01:23.369> we<00:01:23.460> can<00:01:23.640> see

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
so here is our marker and we can see

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:27.140 
so here is our marker and we can see
it's<00:01:23.970> around<00:01:24.180> a<00:01:25.140> stitch<00:01:25.920> in<00:01:26.070> this<00:01:26.250> row<00:01:26.940> right

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:27.150 
it's around a stitch in this row right

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:29.930 
it's around a stitch in this row right
here<00:01:28.190> so<00:01:29.190> we're<00:01:29.310> just<00:01:29.430> going<00:01:29.550> to<00:01:29.580> count<00:01:29.700> this

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:29.940 
here so we're just going to count this

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:31.760 
here so we're just going to count this
one<00:01:30.090> this<00:01:30.210> is<00:01:30.390> number<00:01:30.570> one<00:01:30.840> so<00:01:31.410> that<00:01:31.530> just

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
one this is number one so that just

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:35.900 
one this is number one so that just
count<00:01:31.979> the<00:01:32.100> v's<00:01:32.280> right<00:01:32.490> there<00:01:32.729> one<00:01:33.479> two<00:01:34.910> three

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:35.910 
count the v's right there one two three

00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:37.430 
count the v's right there one two three
and<00:01:36.090> then<00:01:36.810> four

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:37.440 
and then four

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:39.440 
and then four
right<00:01:37.890> the<00:01:38.490> loop<00:01:38.670> on<00:01:38.910> the<00:01:39.030> needle<00:01:39.060> always

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
right the loop on the needle always

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:41.060 
right the loop on the needle always
counts<00:01:39.930> as<00:01:40.020> a<00:01:40.110> row<00:01:40.289> and<00:01:40.590> there's<00:01:40.800> a<00:01:40.890> row<00:01:41.039> of

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.070 
counts as a row and there's a row of

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:41.480 
counts as a row and there's a row of
loops

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
loops

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:43.460 
loops
it's<00:01:41.910> a<00:01:42.030> row<00:01:42.180> so<00:01:42.660> I've<00:01:42.780> done<00:01:42.990> four<00:01:43.289> rows<00:01:43.440> of

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:43.470 
it's a row so I've done four rows of

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:45.590 
it's a row so I've done four rows of
knitting<00:01:43.800> so<00:01:44.310> I<00:01:44.340> just<00:01:44.520> need<00:01:44.640> to<00:01:44.759> do<00:01:44.880> one<00:01:45.390> more

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
knitting so I just need to do one more

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:46.460 
knitting so I just need to do one more
and<00:01:45.810> then<00:01:45.990> I'll<00:01:46.110> be<00:01:46.259> done

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:46.470 
and then I'll be done

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:48.920 
and then I'll be done
so<00:01:47.070> this<00:01:47.220> is<00:01:47.369> a<00:01:47.399> really<00:01:47.850> wonderful<00:01:47.970> way<00:01:48.390> to

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:48.930 
so this is a really wonderful way to

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:50.960 
so this is a really wonderful way to
count<00:01:49.170> especially<00:01:49.440> for<00:01:50.369> instance<00:01:50.640> on<00:01:50.759> a<00:01:50.789> heel

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:50.970 
count especially for instance on a heel

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:54.499 
count especially for instance on a heel
flap<00:01:51.210> when<00:01:51.390> it<00:01:51.509> says<00:01:51.720> knit<00:01:52.460> 26<00:01:53.460> rows<00:01:53.729> and<00:01:54.060> you

00:01:54.499 --> 00:01:54.509 
flap when it says knit 26 rows and you

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:57.230 
flap when it says knit 26 rows and you
don't<00:01:54.690> really<00:01:54.840> want<00:01:55.740> to<00:01:55.920> write<00:01:56.130> it<00:01:56.250> down<00:01:56.399> I

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:57.240 
don't really want to write it down I

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:00.139 
don't really want to write it down I
think<00:01:57.539> writing<00:01:58.110> down<00:01:58.700> what<00:01:59.700> how<00:01:59.789> many<00:01:59.850> rows

00:02:00.139 --> 00:02:00.149 
think writing down what how many rows

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:01.700 
think writing down what how many rows
you've<00:02:00.330> done<00:02:00.509> can<00:02:01.110> actually<00:02:01.380> mess<00:02:01.500> you<00:02:01.649> up

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:01.710 
you've done can actually mess you up

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:02.899 
you've done can actually mess you up
because<00:02:01.950> what<00:02:02.100> if<00:02:02.190> you<00:02:02.280> forget<00:02:02.520> to<00:02:02.670> write<00:02:02.759> it

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:02.909 
because what if you forget to write it

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:04.280 
because what if you forget to write it
down<00:02:03.000> like<00:02:03.509> how<00:02:03.689> do<00:02:03.750> you<00:02:03.840> know<00:02:03.930> did<00:02:04.170> you

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:04.290 
down like how do you know did you

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:06.260 
down like how do you know did you
remember<00:02:04.439> did<00:02:04.770> you<00:02:04.860> not<00:02:05.040> how<00:02:05.850> can<00:02:06.030> you<00:02:06.119> be<00:02:06.240> sure

remember did you not how can you be sure
right<00:02:06.659> I<00:02:06.869> mean<00:02:07.170> you<00:02:07.259> can<00:02:07.439> use<00:02:07.560> it<00:02:07.590> you<00:02:07.890> can<00:02:08.160> use

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:08.280 
right I mean you can use it you can use

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:10.130 
right I mean you can use it you can use
a<00:02:08.310> counter<00:02:08.759> you<00:02:08.880> can<00:02:09.030> write<00:02:09.179> it<00:02:09.269> down<00:02:09.299> but<00:02:09.959> this

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:10.140 
a counter you can write it down but this

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:11.870 
a counter you can write it down but this
way<00:02:10.320> you<00:02:10.769> can<00:02:10.920> always<00:02:11.220> come<00:02:11.400> back<00:02:11.430> to<00:02:11.610> it<00:02:11.730> in

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:11.880 
way you can always come back to it in

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:13.009 
way you can always come back to it in

then four and if you have a lot of rows
to<00:02:25.230> count<00:02:25.590> let's<00:02:25.799> say<00:02:25.890> like<00:02:26.040> 50<00:02:26.519> rows<00:02:27.450> you<00:02:27.900> can

00:02:27.949 --> 00:02:27.959

knit five so how do you know let's look
a<00:03:01.320> 1<00:03:01.530> a<00:03:01.560> knit<00:03:01.709> two<00:03:01.829> together<00:03:01.920> it<00:03:02.190> looks<00:03:02.220> like

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:02.450 
a 1 a knit two together it looks like

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:06.530 
a 1 a knit two together it looks like
now<00:03:03.450> slip<00:03:03.720> that<00:03:03.870> first<00:03:04.170> stitch<00:03:05.389> and<00:03:06.389> knit<00:03:06.510> a

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:06.540 
now slip that first stitch and knit a

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:11.080 
now slip that first stitch and knit a
couple

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:11.090 

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:19.310 

let's<00:03:12.090> do<00:03:12.210> a<00:03:12.240> knit<00:03:12.420> two<00:03:12.510> together<00:03:16.370> okay<00:03:18.200> so<00:03:19.200> we

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:19.320 
let's do a knit two together okay so we

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:23.210 
let's do a knit two together okay so we
can<00:03:19.530> see<00:03:19.740> this<00:03:20.310> hallmark<00:03:21.050> double<00:03:22.220> decrease

00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:23.220 
can see this hallmark double decrease

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:24.740 
can see this hallmark double decrease
right<00:03:23.340> here<00:03:23.550> where<00:03:23.700> the<00:03:23.820> two<00:03:24.000> columns<00:03:24.360> become

00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:24.750 
right here where the two columns become

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:28.910 
right here where the two columns become
one<00:03:24.960> and<00:03:25.370> so<00:03:26.690> these<00:03:27.690> two<00:03:27.900> stitches<00:03:28.140> you<00:03:28.890> can

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:28.920 
one and so these two stitches you can

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:30.170 
one and so these two stitches you can
see<00:03:29.220> them<00:03:29.370> that<00:03:29.550> looks<00:03:29.760> like<00:03:29.880> a<00:03:29.910> knit<00:03:30.090> two

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:30.180 
see them that looks like a knit two

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:31.550 
see them that looks like a knit two
together<00:03:30.240> but<00:03:30.540> what<00:03:30.780> I<00:03:30.810> want<00:03:31.050> you<00:03:31.110> to<00:03:31.170> know<00:03:31.380> is

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:33.840 
that this stitch right here is actually

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:35.630 
that this stitch right here is actually
then<00:03:34.020> knit<00:03:34.140> two<00:03:34.290> together<00:03:34.410> this<00:03:35.310> is<00:03:35.520> the

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:35.640 
then knit two together this is the

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:37.670 
then knit two together this is the
stitch<00:03:35.910> that<00:03:36.090> we<00:03:36.300> made<00:03:36.540> when<00:03:37.110> we<00:03:37.290> did<00:03:37.440> a<00:03:37.470> knit

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:37.680 
stitch that we made when we did a knit

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:39.500 
stitch that we made when we did a knit
two<00:03:37.800> together<00:03:37.920> and<00:03:38.340> this<00:03:38.790> is<00:03:39.000> where<00:03:39.150> we<00:03:39.270> count

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:39.510 
two together and this is where we count

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:50.660 
two together and this is where we count
from<00:03:39.660> so<00:03:42.080> let's<00:03:43.080> go<00:03:43.410> a<00:03:43.440> few<00:03:43.800> more

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:50.670 

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:53.810 

and<00:03:51.240> count<00:03:51.510> how<00:03:51.660> many<00:03:51.720> we've<00:03:51.990> done<00:03:52.610> go<00:03:53.610> back

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:53.820 
and count how many we've done go back

00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:55.670 
and count how many we've done go back
find<00:03:54.480> the<00:03:54.630> weird<00:03:54.810> stitch<00:03:55.110> the<00:03:55.290> one<00:03:55.410> that<00:03:55.530> looks

00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:55.680 
find the weird stitch the one that looks

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:57.740 
find the weird stitch the one that looks
like<00:03:55.800> two<00:03:56.010> going<00:03:56.040> into<00:03:56.490> one<00:03:56.670> there's<00:03:57.300> n<00:03:57.510> it<00:03:57.630> two

00:03:57.740 --> 00:03:57.750 
like two going into one there's n it two

00:03:57.750 --> 00:03:59.870 
like two going into one there's n it two
together<00:03:57.870> so<00:03:58.230> we've<00:03:58.470> done<00:03:58.620> it<00:03:58.650> together<00:03:59.220> one

00:03:59.870 --> 00:03:59.880 
together so we've done it together one

00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:02.930 
together so we've done it together one
two<00:04:00.390> three<00:04:00.960> four<00:04:01.290> alright<00:04:02.190> so<00:04:02.430> what<00:04:02.580> I<00:04:02.610> want<00:04:02.850> to

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:02.940 
two three four alright so what I want to

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:05.210 
two three four alright so what I want to
show<00:04:03.090> you<00:04:03.150> now<00:04:03.480> is<00:04:03.810> how<00:04:03.840> to<00:04:03.990> count<00:04:04.380> from<00:04:04.920> a<00:04:05.070> knit

00:04:05.210 --> 00:04:05.220 
show you now is how to count from a knit

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:06.500 
show you now is how to count from a knit
two<00:04:05.310> together<00:04:05.400> when<00:04:05.730> you<00:04:05.880> have<00:04:06.060> to<00:04:06.150> do<00:04:06.270> a<00:04:06.300> few

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:06.510 
two together when you have to do a few

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:08.630 
two together when you have to do a few
rows<00:04:06.720> and<00:04:06.900> then<00:04:06.990> do<00:04:07.110> another<00:04:07.230> one<00:04:07.560> so<00:04:08.550> I'm

00:04:08.630 --> 00:04:08.640 
rows and then do another one so I'm

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:10.940 
rows and then do another one so I'm
going<00:04:08.790> to<00:04:08.850> keep<00:04:09.000> on<00:04:09.150> knitting<00:04:09.300> and<00:04:09.800> I<00:04:10.800> will

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:10.950 
going to keep on knitting and I will

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:14.470 
going to keep on knitting and I will
meet<00:04:11.160> you<00:04:11.400> in<00:04:11.820> a<00:04:12.360> few<00:04:12.390> rows

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:14.480 
meet you in a few rows

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:17.180 
meet you in a few rows
I've<00:04:15.480> now<00:04:15.720> knitted<00:04:16.079> a<00:04:16.170> few<00:04:16.380> more<00:04:16.560> rounds<00:04:16.769> and

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:17.190 
I've now knitted a few more rounds and

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:19.039 
I've now knitted a few more rounds and
let's<00:04:17.700> count<00:04:17.940> and<00:04:18.060> see<00:04:18.150> how<00:04:18.269> many<00:04:18.510> we've<00:04:18.810> done

00:04:19.039 --> 00:04:19.049 
let's count and see how many we've done

00:04:19.049 --> 00:04:20.840 
let's count and see how many we've done
this<00:04:19.560> is<00:04:19.680> especially<00:04:20.010> helpful<00:04:20.340> if<00:04:20.609> you<00:04:20.700> have<00:04:20.820> a

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:20.850 
this is especially helpful if you have a

00:04:20.850 --> 00:04:22.909 
this is especially helpful if you have a
pattern<00:04:21.090> that<00:04:21.239> says<00:04:21.510> do<00:04:22.049> a<00:04:22.079> decrease<00:04:22.530> round

00:04:22.909 --> 00:04:22.919 
pattern that says do a decrease round

00:04:22.919 --> 00:04:26.150 
pattern that says do a decrease round
and<00:04:23.490> that<00:04:23.669> X<00:04:24.480> number<00:04:24.870> of<00:04:24.900> plain<00:04:25.560> rounds<00:04:26.040> will

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:26.160 
and that X number of plain rounds will

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:27.770 
and that X number of plain rounds will
work<00:04:26.340> even<00:04:26.580> for<00:04:26.970> you<00:04:27.150> know<00:04:27.240> four<00:04:27.540> or<00:04:27.570> five

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:27.780 
work even for you know four or five

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:28.940 
work even for you know four or five
rounds<00:04:27.990> and<00:04:28.200> then<00:04:28.320> do<00:04:28.440> another<00:04:28.470> decrease

00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:28.950 
rounds and then do another decrease

00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:31.280 
rounds and then do another decrease
round<00:04:29.430> this<00:04:30.000> happens<00:04:30.419> a<00:04:30.540> lot<00:04:30.840> when<00:04:31.169> you're

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:31.290 
round this happens a lot when you're

00:04:31.290 --> 00:04:34.580 
round this happens a lot when you're
shaping<00:04:31.590> four<00:04:32.040> sleeves<00:04:32.490> or<00:04:32.820> sweater<00:04:33.630> so<00:04:34.410> let's

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:34.590 
shaping four sleeves or sweater so let's

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:36.890 
shaping four sleeves or sweater so let's
look<00:04:34.680> at<00:04:34.830> our<00:04:34.919> swatch<00:04:35.220> so<00:04:35.580> find<00:04:36.390> the<00:04:36.600> knit<00:04:36.780> two

00:04:36.890 --> 00:04:36.900 
look at our swatch so find the knit two

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:40.909 
look at our swatch so find the knit two
together<00:04:38.810> here<00:04:39.810> it<00:04:39.900> is<00:04:39.990> right<00:04:40.140> here<00:04:40.200> here<00:04:40.830> are

00:04:40.909 --> 00:04:40.919 
together here it is right here here are

00:04:40.919 --> 00:04:42.290 
together here it is right here here are
the<00:04:40.980> two<00:04:41.160> stitches<00:04:41.400> that<00:04:41.669> came<00:04:41.910> together<00:04:42.060> to

00:04:42.290 --> 00:04:42.300 
the two stitches that came together to

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:43.970 
the two stitches that came together to
become<00:04:42.450> one<00:04:42.810> and<00:04:42.990> so<00:04:43.169> what<00:04:43.470> the<00:04:43.590> important

00:04:43.970 --> 00:04:43.980 
become one and so what the important

00:04:43.980 --> 00:04:46.370 
become one and so what the important
thing<00:04:44.100> is<00:04:44.250> that<00:04:44.280> this<00:04:45.090> right<00:04:45.450> here<00:04:45.480> this<00:04:46.320> is

00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:46.380 
thing is that this right here this is

00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:48.230 
thing is that this right here this is
the<00:04:46.830> knit<00:04:47.010> two<00:04:47.160> together<00:04:47.280> this<00:04:47.700> is<00:04:47.910> the<00:04:48.060> row

00:04:48.230 --> 00:04:48.240 
the knit two together this is the row

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:50.090 
the knit two together this is the row
that<00:04:48.780> you<00:04:48.900> are<00:04:49.050> on<00:04:49.169> when<00:04:49.380> you<00:04:49.500> brought<00:04:49.800> those

00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:50.100 
that you are on when you brought those

00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:52.640 
that you are on when you brought those
two<00:04:50.370> previous<00:04:50.820> rows<00:04:51.030> together<00:04:51.240> so<00:04:52.140> here's<00:04:52.530> our

00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:52.650 
two previous rows together so here's our

00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:56.630 
two previous rows together so here's our
decrease<00:04:53.070> row<00:04:53.280> so<00:04:53.610> we've<00:04:54.000> got<00:04:54.590> one<00:04:55.590> two<00:04:56.310> three

00:04:56.630 --> 00:04:56.640 
decrease row so we've got one two three

00:04:56.640 --> 00:05:00.140 
decrease row so we've got one two three
plain<00:04:57.600> rounds<00:04:58.020> plain<00:04:58.410> rows<00:04:58.650> after<00:04:59.280> that<00:04:59.430> does

00:05:00.140 --> 00:05:00.150 
plain rounds plain rows after that does

00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:02.420 
plain rounds plain rows after that does
that<00:05:00.300> make<00:05:00.419> sense<00:05:00.680> so<00:05:01.680> this<00:05:01.890> isn't<00:05:02.100> the<00:05:02.250> knit

00:05:02.420 --> 00:05:02.430 
that make sense so this isn't the knit

00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:04.370 
that make sense so this isn't the knit
two<00:05:02.550> together<00:05:02.669> here<00:05:03.270> although<00:05:04.020> this<00:05:04.169> is<00:05:04.350> the

00:05:04.370 --> 00:05:04.380 
two together here although this is the

00:05:04.380 --> 00:05:05.750 
two together here although this is the
hallmark<00:05:04.680> of<00:05:04.919> a<00:05:05.040> knit<00:05:05.190> together<00:05:05.340> and<00:05:05.610> how<00:05:05.700> you

00:05:05.750 --> 00:05:05.760 
hallmark of a knit together and how you

00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:07.370 
hallmark of a knit together and how you
can<00:05:05.940> find<00:05:06.210> it<00:05:06.360> there's<00:05:06.900> our<00:05:07.080> knit<00:05:07.260> two

00:05:07.370 --> 00:05:07.380 
can find it there's our knit two

00:05:07.380 --> 00:05:10.670 
can find it there's our knit two
together<00:05:07.500> and<00:05:07.950> then<00:05:08.370> one<00:05:08.669> two<00:05:09.240> three<00:05:09.630> so<00:05:10.380> once

00:05:10.670 --> 00:05:10.680 
together and then one two three so once

00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:13.430 
together and then one two three so once
you<00:05:10.830> know<00:05:11.040> how<00:05:11.460> to<00:05:11.520> recognize<00:05:12.260> what<00:05:13.260> you've

00:05:13.430 --> 00:05:13.440 
you know how to recognize what you've

00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:16.490 
you know how to recognize what you've
done<00:05:13.680> and<00:05:13.950> how<00:05:14.150> many<00:05:15.150> rows<00:05:15.630> or<00:05:15.990> stitches<00:05:16.320> it's

00:05:16.490 --> 00:05:16.500 
done and how many rows or stitches it's

00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:18.409 
done and how many rows or stitches it's
been<00:05:16.650> since<00:05:16.890> you've<00:05:17.040> done<00:05:17.220> it<00:05:17.430> you<00:05:17.880> can<00:05:18.030> go<00:05:18.150> so

00:05:18.409 --> 00:05:18.419 
been since you've done it you can go so

00:05:18.419 --> 00:05:19.880 
been since you've done it you can go so
much<00:05:18.570> faster<00:05:18.840> because<00:05:19.050> you<00:05:19.380> can<00:05:19.500> just<00:05:19.650> look<00:05:19.740> at

00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:19.890 
much faster because you can just look at

00:05:19.890 --> 00:05:21.170 
much faster because you can just look at
your<00:05:19.979> work<00:05:20.160> as<00:05:20.340> opposed<00:05:20.580> to<00:05:20.640> writing<00:05:20.880> it<00:05:21.000> down

00:05:21.170 --> 00:05:21.180 
your work as opposed to writing it down

00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:23.180 
your work as opposed to writing it down
or<00:05:21.479> rereading<00:05:22.350> the<00:05:22.530> pattern<00:05:22.800> over<00:05:22.979> and<00:05:23.070> over

00:05:23.180 --> 00:05:23.190 
or rereading the pattern over and over

00:05:23.190 --> 00:05:25.070 
or rereading the pattern over and over
and<00:05:23.310> counting<00:05:23.760> back<00:05:24.000> or<00:05:24.630> anything<00:05:24.810> like<00:05:24.960> that
