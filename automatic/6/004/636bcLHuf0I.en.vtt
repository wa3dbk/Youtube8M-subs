00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:09.270
 hello dear welcome to 

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:12.930
 my recipes today i show you my 

00:00:09.270 --> 00:00:15.270
 which recipe with sheep's cheese filling 

00:00:12.930 --> 00:00:18.570
 First of all, I have 200 grams of sheep's cheese 

00:00:15.270 --> 00:00:20.820
 wore and dried with annika so far 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:23.460
 peppermint and leaf publicare 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:27.619
 specified and mulled then we need 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:29.930
 two days will be denied and sesame 

00:00:27.619 --> 00:00:33.050
 black cumin to sprinkle 

00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:40.159
 we need a glass for the dough 

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:45.260
 lukewarm milk a glass of lukewarm water 

00:00:40.159 --> 00:00:45.260
 always measure with the same glass 

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:55.640
 a glass 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:55.640
 oil 

00:01:00.249 --> 00:01:14.030
 then about two to three tablespoons 

00:01:03.379 --> 00:01:17.409
 sugar 1 tablespoon of salt and a packet 

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:17.409
 fresh help 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:34.590
 First of all, for me, the whole and 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:37.080
 then give me about a kilo of flour 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:41.670
 then always be careful 

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:45.229
 to give in because the village now not 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:45.229
 be very consolidated 

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:25.990
 so I do not have quite a kilometer 

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:26.410
 consumed the goods then so about 800 

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:28.270
 gram 

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:31.240
 Now we close the lid and 

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:33.550
 leave and spend a day in a warm place 

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:35.590
 about 30 minutes walk 

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:38.590
 Now there will be little balls 

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:41.160
 dripping from my dance probably not very 

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:41.160
 large 

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:55.600
 and then very briefly in oil 

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:55.600
 You can smear your trade with oil 

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:07.990
 with this subset you get now 

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:11.730
 right out so choose that is too much 

00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:11.730
 of course, the length can pull money 

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:31.440
 so now you can still have your kids 

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:37.530
 once smeared with oil and presses the 

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:41.150
 are easy with the finger in and 

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:41.150
 then this stuffing wrestled 

00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:14.130
 so now I have my best with 

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:16.200
 distance also a leaflet greedy and 

00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:19.230
 This then took about 15 minutes left 

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:21.860
 Let go and be with Beiger 

00:04:19.230 --> 00:04:23.760
 sprinkle with sesame and in 

00:04:21.860 --> 00:04:26.670
 sprinkle the black cumin 

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:31.620
 then they come in the oven at 160 degrees 

00:04:26.670 --> 00:04:34.200
 about 30 minutes where the particles are 

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:36.330
 get out of the oven and see her again 

00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:38.130
 Of course, super delicious, I hope so 

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:39.810
 was fun to watch and 

00:04:38.130 --> 00:04:43.700
 I wish you much fun baking yourself 

00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:43.700
 and say goodbye until the next video
