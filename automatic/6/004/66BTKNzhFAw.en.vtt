00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.940
 well my name is danilo I have nextel there 

00:00:03.290 --> 00:00:09.929
 practically three years and until then 

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:12.380
 It worked perfectly to solve 

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:18.180
 Migrate to these 3g plane junkies 

00:00:12.380 --> 00:00:20.270
 show you how good it is that 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:30.470
 it's on the phone 

00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:30.470
 nÃ©nÃ© moto x and look at the nextel sign 

00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:40.829
 I live in a central region and everything 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:43.879
 operators pay here including nextel 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:48.899
 hours my radio is only working 

00:00:43.879 --> 00:00:52.260
 because I have areas connected here in 

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:53.789
 my house because otherwise it does not work 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:54.690
 depends on a data connection to 

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:56.910
 to function 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:58.739
 that is, if you have a locality that 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:59.750
 does not work 3g you also run out 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:02.250
 radio 

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:08.460
 I'll try to make the call from you 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:11.220
 see mobile network not available 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:13.439
 It's been 20 days since the group got a new plan. 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:17.250
 since then he has never been able to 

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:20.340
 satisfactorily signal Nextel 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:22.350
 fluctuates a lot and bad teaching is bad 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:24.090
 in almost every place 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:26.729
 you can not use radio 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:28.020
 Can not use telephony, can not 

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:31.130
 use nothing 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:31.130
 the bill has arrived 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:36.000
 the day is now out of service 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:40.799
 works you get in touch with 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:45.299
 support media reports that it is normal 

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:48.210
 sign is that there is no competition 

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:50.100
 open they open a check of the 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:52.079
 load of technology that takes five 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:54.299
 days for their response and no sign of the 

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:56.540
 Normal right there tells you that the technology 

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:58.710
 3g has expansion for you to wait 

00:01:56.540 --> 00:02:00.930
 while paying to use 

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:03.600
 I adopted a cell phone here 

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:09.220

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:12.770

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:16.160

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:19.250

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:21.770

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:24.080

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:26.660

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:31.550
