or a two and a half inch brush now when

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:28.880 
or a two and a half inch brush now when
it<00:00:26.789> comes<00:00:26.970> to<00:00:27.060> paint<00:00:27.269> on<00:00:27.359> the<00:00:27.449> top<00:00:27.599> edge<00:00:27.890> it's

it comes to paint on the top edge it's

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:31.580

the<00:00:29.010> basics<00:00:29.429> of<00:00:29.519> all<00:00:29.699> cutting<00:00:29.939> in<00:00:30.410> you<00:00:31.410> just

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:31.590 
the basics of all cutting in you just

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:33.620 
the basics of all cutting in you just
run<00:00:31.830> the<00:00:31.859> brush<00:00:32.189> along<00:00:32.790> there<00:00:33.059> with<00:00:33.360> a<00:00:33.390> bit<00:00:33.540> of

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:33.630 
run the brush along there with a bit of

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:36.740 
run the brush along there with a bit of
paint<00:00:33.840> on<00:00:33.989> there<00:00:34.969> then<00:00:35.969> actually<00:00:36.270> come<00:00:36.510> back

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750 
paint on there then actually come back

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:40.850 
paint on there then actually come back
put<00:00:37.590> still<00:00:37.950> a<00:00:38.010> bit<00:00:38.190> too<00:00:38.219> much<00:00:38.430> paint<00:00:39.770> then<00:00:40.770> you

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860 
put still a bit too much paint then you

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:47.889 
put still a bit too much paint then you
come<00:00:41.070> back<00:00:41.250> and<00:00:41.899> go<00:00:42.899> in<00:00:43.079> close<00:00:43.350> to<00:00:43.559> the<00:00:43.649> wall

00:00:47.889 --> 00:00:47.899 

00:00:47.899 --> 00:00:49.970 

and<00:00:48.899> as<00:00:49.050> you<00:00:49.140> can<00:00:49.260> see<00:00:49.379> it's<00:00:49.530> only<00:00:49.620> really<00:00:49.829> the

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:49.980 
and as you can see it's only really the

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:51.290 
and as you can see it's only really the
back<00:00:50.190> bristles<00:00:50.670> of<00:00:50.730> the<00:00:50.760> brush<00:00:50.969> that's

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 
back bristles of the brush that's

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:56.720 
back bristles of the brush that's
actually<00:00:51.629> doing<00:00:51.870> the<00:00:51.960> work<00:00:55.430> once<00:00:56.430> you've<00:00:56.579> done

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
actually doing the work once you've done

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:01.369 
actually doing the work once you've done
that<00:00:57.350> you<00:00:58.350> want<00:00:58.530> to<00:00:58.590> do<00:00:58.710> the<00:00:59.809> that<00:01:00.809> lip<00:01:01.020> there

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
that you want to do the that lip there

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:04.490 
that you want to do the that lip there
you<00:01:01.920> don't<00:01:02.190> want<00:01:02.309> to<00:01:02.370> hit<00:01:02.460> the<00:01:02.579> wall<00:01:03.470> so<00:01:04.470> I

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
you don't want to hit the wall so I

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:08.840 
you don't want to hit the wall so I
normally<00:01:04.979> angle<00:01:05.280> the<00:01:05.369> brush<00:01:05.580> so<00:01:07.670> there's<00:01:08.670> no

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
normally angle the brush so there's no

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:10.399 
normally angle the brush so there's no
chance<00:01:09.210> of<00:01:09.420> any<00:01:09.540> of<00:01:09.659> the<00:01:09.720> bristles<00:01:10.110> actually

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
chance of any of the bristles actually

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:14.359 
chance of any of the bristles actually
hitting<00:01:10.560> the<00:01:10.650> wall<00:01:12.560> and<00:01:13.560> the<00:01:13.950> bottom<00:01:14.100> bits

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369 
hitting the wall and the bottom bits

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:18.140 
hitting the wall and the bottom bits
same<00:01:14.700> put<00:01:15.090> some<00:01:15.240> paint<00:01:15.420> on<00:01:15.540> there<00:01:16.520> as<00:01:17.520> he<00:01:17.970> a<00:01:18.000> bit

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:18.150 
same put some paint on there as he a bit

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:24.190 
same put some paint on there as he a bit
too<00:01:18.299> much<00:01:20.270> and<00:01:21.290> then<00:01:22.290> cut<00:01:22.530> the<00:01:22.619> bottom<00:01:22.860> bit<00:01:23.009> in

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:24.200 
too much and then cut the bottom bit in

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:26.450 
too much and then cut the bottom bit in
now<00:01:25.200> even<00:01:25.470> though<00:01:25.530> there's<00:01:25.680> not<00:01:25.770> carpet<00:01:26.310> he

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 
now even though there's not carpet he

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:28.780 
now even though there's not carpet he
are<00:01:26.580> still<00:01:26.850> don't<00:01:27.030> want<00:01:27.180> to<00:01:27.270> hit<00:01:27.360> the<00:01:27.479> floor

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:28.790 
are still don't want to hit the floor

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:35.649 
are still don't want to hit the floor
because<00:01:29.790> there<00:01:29.939> is<00:01:30.060> chance<00:01:30.390> and<00:01:30.689> pick<00:01:30.840> up<00:01:30.960> the

00:01:35.649 --> 00:01:35.659 

00:01:35.659 --> 00:01:42.310 

next<00:01:36.659> bit

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:42.320 

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:44.390 

now<00:01:43.320> dip<00:01:43.560> the<00:01:43.590> brush<00:01:43.830> and<00:01:44.070> I'll<00:01:44.130> generally

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:44.400 
now dip the brush and I'll generally

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:45.980 
now dip the brush and I'll generally
give<00:01:44.580> it<00:01:44.670> a<00:01:44.790> little<00:01:44.970> bit<00:01:45.120> of<00:01:45.180> a<00:01:45.240> war<00:01:45.450> so<00:01:45.810> there's

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:45.990 
give it a little bit of a war so there's

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:52.360 
give it a little bit of a war so there's
not<00:01:46.110> too<00:01:46.320> much<00:01:46.500> on<00:01:46.830> there<00:01:48.500> so<00:01:49.500> once<00:01:49.680> again

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:52.370 

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:58.580 

run<00:01:53.370> along<00:01:53.610> close<00:01:56.840> and<00:01:57.840> then<00:01:57.960> this<00:01:58.050> time<00:01:58.380> I'll

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:58.590 
run along close and then this time I'll

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:11.390 
run along close and then this time I'll
cut<00:01:58.920> it<00:01:59.010> in<00:02:09.140> then<00:02:10.140> we<00:02:10.229> left<00:02:10.440> the<00:02:10.619> nice<00:02:10.890> and<00:02:11.220> neat

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:11.400 
cut it in then we left the nice and neat

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:29.680 
cut it in then we left the nice and neat
line<00:02:20.330> and<00:02:21.330> as<00:02:21.540> before

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:29.690 

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:34.080 

so<00:02:30.410> definitely<00:02:30.860> I<00:02:30.980> want<00:02:31.070> to<00:02:31.190> eat<00:02:31.250> the<00:02:31.340> low<00:02:31.520> side

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:34.090 

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:45.850 

there<00:02:35.090> the<00:02:35.180> problem<00:02:35.360> bit

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:45.860 

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:48.229 

now<00:02:46.860> this<00:02:47.010> doorframe<00:02:47.459> is<00:02:47.640> the<00:02:47.700> actual<00:02:48.000> same

00:02:48.229 --> 00:02:48.239 
now this doorframe is the actual same

00:02:48.239 --> 00:02:51.380 
now this doorframe is the actual same
color<00:02:49.400> but<00:02:50.400> I<00:02:50.430> don't<00:02:50.640> really<00:02:50.760> want<00:02:50.969> overlap

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:51.390 
color but I don't really want overlap

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:53.780 
color but I don't really want overlap
marks<00:02:51.810> so<00:02:52.049> the<00:02:52.170> best<00:02:52.379> is<00:02:53.069> to<00:02:53.310> try<00:02:53.489> to<00:02:53.519> actually

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:53.790 
marks so the best is to try to actually

00:02:53.790 --> 00:03:00.820 
marks so the best is to try to actually
cut<00:02:54.060> it<00:02:54.150> in

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:00.830 

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:06.890 

so<00:03:01.830> yeah<00:03:02.010> that's<00:03:02.160> a<00:03:02.250> bit<00:03:02.370> of<00:03:02.460> a<00:03:02.520> demo<00:03:02.940> on<00:03:03.530> how<00:03:05.900> to

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:06.900 
so yeah that's a bit of a demo on how to

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:10.430 
so yeah that's a bit of a demo on how to
paint<00:03:07.200> skating's<00:03:07.680> or<00:03:07.830> baseboards
