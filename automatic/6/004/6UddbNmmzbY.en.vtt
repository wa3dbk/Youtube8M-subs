00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:16.020
 It was a special pleasure for me 

00:00:12.930 --> 00:00:18.900
 yes after that it is actually 30 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:21.150
 years ago is finished with the berliners 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:23.999
 a recording in these days are the 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:25.289
 this song the huge stories in 

00:00:23.999 --> 00:00:26.519
 Everything has happened here in the hall 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:28.409
 The room she is in has everything 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:30.150
 played by this through this door 

00:00:28.409 --> 00:00:32.040
 I came that was one 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:33.780
 Key experience for me as a musician 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:35.670
 in my life but not only for me 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:40.080
 I believe the whole first one back then 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:43.440
 that was a dog on heating her 

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:45.570
 later mozart g dur and for me 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:48.180
 memorable it was, of course, a 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:52.500
 beauty that you can only say 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:54.090
 it must have been composed for her 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:57.860
 it is comparable so relative 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:57.860
 incomprehensible took so long 

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:47.350
 for me, the musical time is beautiful 

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:48.580
 it's really me everywhere now that I'm there 

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:50.550
 not very much in recent years 

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:52.270
 intense with the work on the podium 

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:54.010
 I 've been busy again 

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:56.800
 Everything reveals the fingers already the 

00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:58.630
 The phrasing Kessler continued 

00:01:56.800 --> 00:02:00.790
 Partitur looked closely so it seemed 

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:03.390
 now it had to be absolutely everywhere 

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:03.390
 done 

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:18.829
 now 

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:32.930
 But there are many factors to it 

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:35.840
 have contributed that the borscher 

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:37.880
 concert played less often than 

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:40.010
 for example, the building authority, the small 

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:41.330
 allusion to technical characteristics and to 

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:42.769
 others certainly a whole 

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:45.290
 specific compositional 

00:02:42.769 --> 00:02:47.180
 given that a very fine 

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:49.880
 shine through and balance times 

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:52.190
 of the orchestra and yes 

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:53.900
 obviously there are not that many 

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:55.970
 musician the unusually 

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:58.269
 attack orchestrated work 

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:58.269
 wool 

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:15.380
 in this difficult situation the 

00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:17.030
 concert atmosphere again again 

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:19.580
 reproduce it all over 

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:21.350
 This thomas still phones microphones 

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:23.330
 be better and it is also very 

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:25.459
 on what you are centered on that one 

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:25.910
 that you turn off these obstacles 

00:03:25.459 --> 00:03:27.800
 can 

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:30.709
 that is, it is a bit mental 

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:32.120
 work that you know of course and knew 

00:03:30.709 --> 00:03:33.920
 Logically, the first time itself 

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:35.750
 overcome and its daily form arrives 

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:38.030
 the wonderful but very old for the 

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:40.400
 own but what would I have from 

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:41.660
 the decisive meaning is the 

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:43.730
 partnership the musical 

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:46.040
 partnership and if you are a conductor 

00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:48.110
 manfred honeck at his side has it 

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:51.410
 the rats and the madness 

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:52.940
 brings energy and with the berlinern 

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:55.900
 then I can not go wrong like that 

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:55.900
 every 17 

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:31.780
 it must never be the only concern 

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:34.570
 to set up technical things 

00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:38.290
 Of course, we expect that both the 

00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:41.050
 it was also the guests need 

00:04:38.290 --> 00:04:42.730
 of course playing sparkling clean and also 

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:44.860
 technically successful but we are allowed 

00:04:42.730 --> 00:04:47.350
 do not be tempted it's always it 

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:51.280
 it's always about the music it always works 

00:04:47.350 --> 00:04:52.060
 so something special from this moment 

00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:53.980
 to accomplish 

00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:56.230
 I think that's the big one 

00:04:53.980 --> 00:04:59.610
 Challenge I think it's beautiful 

00:04:56.230 --> 00:04:59.610
 as is well managed 

00:05:23.610 --> 00:05:29.770
 Interesting is like motion rim passion 

00:05:27.479 --> 00:05:31.569
 So this folksy is at 

00:05:29.770 --> 00:05:33.039
 lecture certainly an important element and 

00:05:31.569 --> 00:05:35.469
 yes, it's too big for him 

00:05:33.039 --> 00:05:37.749
 helped popularity and has last 

00:05:35.469 --> 00:05:39.479
 endes led so with Slavic 

00:05:37.749 --> 00:05:43.869
 dances or with his Irish wise 

00:05:39.479 --> 00:05:45.759
 it became known that his publishers give 

00:05:43.869 --> 00:05:47.169
 the romance bath and also around that makes 

00:05:45.759 --> 00:05:49.119
 back and that is one of the 

00:05:47.169 --> 00:05:50.979
 Why is that wonderfully coincidental and 

00:05:49.119 --> 00:05:53.110
 because it's two important elements 

00:05:50.979 --> 00:05:55.149
 from warsh create once more 

00:05:53.110 --> 00:05:59.249
 on the one hand embodies the songful and 

00:05:55.149 --> 00:05:59.249
 on the other hand, this folk dance
