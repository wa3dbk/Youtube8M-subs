kind<00:01:06.470> of<00:01:06.619> wake<00:01:06.799> up<00:01:07.009> and<00:01:07.250> not<00:01:07.340> be<00:01:07.400> in<00:01:07.610> the<00:01:07.670> dark

00:01:07.899 --> 00:01:07.909 
kind of wake up and not be in the dark

00:01:07.909 --> 00:01:10.929 
kind of wake up and not be in the dark
so<00:01:08.689> then<00:01:08.840> I<00:01:09.080> make<00:01:09.470> my<00:01:09.740> bed<00:01:09.920> which<00:01:10.310> is<00:01:10.580> a<00:01:10.640> pain

so then I make my bed which is a pain

00:01:10.939 --> 00:01:13.030 
so then I make my bed which is a pain
because<00:01:11.240> it's<00:01:11.420> against<00:01:11.840> the<00:01:11.930> wall<00:01:12.110> I<00:01:12.439> don't

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:00.910 
way which I guess I could have done that

00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:03.810 
way which I guess I could have done that
before<00:02:01.230> but<00:02:02.230> I<00:02:02.290> didn't<00:02:02.680> and<00:02:02.980> yes<00:02:03.370> my<00:02:03.580> blinds

got stuck that always happens to me and

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:09.300 
got stuck that always happens to me and
then<00:02:06.730> I<00:02:07.060> go<00:02:07.180> down<00:02:07.210> and<00:02:07.390> I<00:02:07.810> get<00:02:07.990> my<00:02:08.230> it's<00:02:08.560> 10<00:02:08.860> plus
