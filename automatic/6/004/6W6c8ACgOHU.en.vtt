00:00:05.029 --> 00:00:09.240
 hi how about 

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:12.330
 now we are going to learn to remove or 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:15.089
 whiten our nails as you see they have 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:18.449
 a yellow tone is therefore enamel 

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:21.320
 but now let's change that we're going to 

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:21.320
 make the roses 

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:28.259
 what we are going to need is a been a 

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:33.550
 bowl 

00:00:28.259 --> 00:00:37.920
 we are going to need water 

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:37.920
 we are going to need lemon 

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:44.250
 baking soda 

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:46.880
 cuticle oil 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:46.880
 and we believe 

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:54.920
 we are going to need a lime 

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:56.660
 and a brush even a brush 

00:00:54.920 --> 00:01:00.640
 teeth 

00:00:56.660 --> 00:01:00.640
 in our century we are going to deposit 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:05.330
 three tablespoons of water 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:20.869
 two tablespoons of flour 

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:37.140
 and finally bicarbonate 

00:01:54.409 --> 00:01:58.090
 let's put our fingers 

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:06.740
 let's leave them for a few moments and let's 

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:06.740
 move on to brush the 

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:17.900
 if they see that the spotting is very strong 

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:21.110
 of your yellow dreams we are going to give you 

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:25.810
 a little lime dic 

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:25.810
 in the nails where they are more yellow 

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:55.100
 or not 

00:03:56.660 --> 00:04:04.489
 already after having left it 25 minutes 

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:04.489
 like us more 

00:04:04.770 --> 00:04:08.570
 we proceed to rinse with water 

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:30.100
 I do not know 

00:04:26.949 --> 00:04:33.430
 you are going to see changes 

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:38.010
 it looks yellow and this has already taken on a tone 

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:38.010
 pink a rose 

00:04:46.969 --> 00:04:50.649
 after being super yellow 

00:04:56.980 --> 00:05:04.740
 now we go to a polygon to erase 

00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:04.740
 the marks that are left of the file 

00:05:24.729 --> 00:05:33.210
 after polishing it we are going to put 

00:05:28.719 --> 00:05:33.210
 cuticle oil around the nail 

00:05:34.100 --> 00:05:37.510
 then to increase it 

00:05:46.930 --> 00:05:52.030
 massage around the nail 

00:06:02.409 --> 00:06:08.350
 in funds 

00:06:05.230 --> 00:06:11.130
 we apply cream 

00:06:08.350 --> 00:06:11.130
 our hands 

00:06:17.390 --> 00:06:23.210
 and after that procedure we're going to 

00:06:20.870 --> 00:06:25.300
 rest to let rest our 

00:06:23.210 --> 00:06:28.000
 nail 

00:06:25.300 --> 00:06:31.330
 three days at least 

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:36.340
 without painting anything without acrylic 

00:06:31.330 --> 00:06:39.640
 put false nails nothing maximum 5 days 

00:06:36.340 --> 00:06:41.580
 to recover and regain're 

00:06:39.640 --> 00:06:46.600
 wetting 

00:06:41.580 --> 00:06:50.880
 his natural arm and well that would be all 

00:06:46.600 --> 00:06:50.880
