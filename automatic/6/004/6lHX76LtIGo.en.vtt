like it melted or something

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:03.770

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
so you open it and it has a cover to

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:05.960 
so you open it and it has a cover to
protect<00:01:03.989> the<00:01:04.350> blushes<00:01:04.830> so<00:01:05.430> I<00:01:05.489> did<00:01:05.729> end<00:01:05.939> up

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
protect the blushes so I did end up

those and go back over the two swatches
as<00:03:06.390> you<00:03:06.630> can<00:03:06.780> see<00:03:07.050> the<00:03:08.010> really<00:03:08.250> really<00:03:08.550> deep

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:08.880 
as you can see the really really deep

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:11.360 
as you can see the really really deep
one<00:03:09.140> after<00:03:10.140> adding<00:03:10.380> a<00:03:10.410> second<00:03:10.769> swatch<00:03:11.010> you

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:11.370 
one after adding a second swatch you

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:15.470 
one after adding a second swatch you
know<00:03:11.580> it's<00:03:11.910> a<00:03:12.709> pretty<00:03:13.709> good<00:03:14.010> color<00:03:14.550> the<00:03:15.209> pink

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:15.480 
know it's a pretty good color the pink

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:17.330 
know it's a pretty good color the pink
one<00:03:15.720> after<00:03:16.260> adding<00:03:16.470> a<00:03:16.530> second<00:03:16.799> swatch<00:03:17.070> is

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:17.340 
one after adding a second swatch is

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:20.780 
one after adding a second swatch is
still<00:03:17.579> pretty<00:03:17.850> light<00:03:18.120> but<00:03:18.860> like<00:03:19.860> I<00:03:20.010> said<00:03:20.070> you

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:20.790 
still pretty light but like I said you

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:22.850 
still pretty light but like I said you
know<00:03:20.940> you<00:03:21.570> wipe<00:03:21.810> and<00:03:22.200> it's<00:03:22.320> almost<00:03:22.500> like<00:03:22.709> the

00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:22.860 
know you wipe and it's almost like the

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:25.160 
know you wipe and it's almost like the
product<00:03:23.190> is<00:03:23.280> completely<00:03:23.940> gone<00:03:24.120> if<00:03:24.450> I<00:03:24.600> did<00:03:24.930> find

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:25.170 
product is completely gone if I did find

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:28.130 
product is completely gone if I did find
the<00:03:25.470> color<00:03:25.680> that<00:03:26.010> I<00:03:26.070> liked<00:03:26.310> in<00:03:26.489> here<00:03:26.700> I<00:03:27.140> think

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:28.140 
the color that I liked in here I think

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:30.170 
the color that I liked in here I think
it<00:03:28.380> would<00:03:28.440> probably<00:03:28.530> hit<00:03:29.310> pan<00:03:29.549> pretty<00:03:29.910> quickly

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:30.180 
it would probably hit pan pretty quickly

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:34.190 
it would probably hit pan pretty quickly
so<00:03:30.739> I<00:03:31.820> definitely<00:03:32.820> think<00:03:33.150> this<00:03:33.510> was<00:03:33.690> up<00:03:33.900> a

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:34.200 
so I definitely think this was up a

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:36.350 
so I definitely think this was up a
waste<00:03:34.769> of<00:03:34.950> my<00:03:35.100> money<00:03:35.130> I<00:03:35.579> am<00:03:35.790> gonna<00:03:36.030> try<00:03:36.180> and

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:36.360 
waste of my money I am gonna try and

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:39.830 
waste of my money I am gonna try and
make<00:03:36.420> them<00:03:36.690> work<00:03:36.930> but<00:03:38.450> definitely<00:03:39.450> this<00:03:39.660> is

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:39.840 
make them work but definitely this is

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:41.300 
make them work but definitely this is
something<00:03:40.140> that<00:03:40.170> I<00:03:40.290> think<00:03:40.320> maybe<00:03:40.709> only<00:03:41.040> I'll

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:41.310 
something that I think maybe only I'll

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:42.860 
something that I think maybe only I'll
be<00:03:41.459> able<00:03:41.519> to<00:03:41.640> use<00:03:41.730> in<00:03:41.910> the<00:03:42.000> spring<00:03:42.360> and<00:03:42.630> if<00:03:42.750> I

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:42.870 
be able to use in the spring and if I

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:44.690 
be able to use in the spring and if I
get<00:03:43.049> even<00:03:43.260> slightly<00:03:43.709> darker<00:03:44.250> in<00:03:44.400> the<00:03:44.489> summer

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:44.700 
get even slightly darker in the summer

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:46.640 
get even slightly darker in the summer
no<00:03:45.420> these<00:03:45.630> are<00:03:45.780> gonna<00:03:45.900> show<00:03:46.110> up<00:03:46.170> in<00:03:46.230> my<00:03:46.350> skins

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:46.650 
no these are gonna show up in my skins

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:48.289 
no these are gonna show up in my skins
you<00:03:47.100> win<00:03:47.250> some<00:03:47.519> you<00:03:47.549> lose<00:03:47.820> some

00:03:48.289 --> 00:03:48.299

00:03:48.299 --> 00:03:51.500 
you win some you lose some
I've<00:03:48.420> purchased<00:03:48.810> me<00:03:49.260> things<00:03:49.590> from<00:03:50.160> eBay<00:03:50.640> I've

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:51.510 
I've purchased me things from eBay I've

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:53.810 
I've purchased me things from eBay I've
always<00:03:51.810> had<00:03:51.930> good<00:03:52.079> experiences<00:03:52.980> so<00:03:53.400> this<00:03:53.670> was

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:53.820 
always had good experiences so this was

00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:57.319 
always had good experiences so this was
my<00:03:53.970> first<00:03:54.390> kind<00:03:54.690> of<00:03:54.810> disappointment<00:03:55.760> but<00:03:56.760> I

00:03:57.319 --> 00:03:57.329 
my first kind of disappointment but I

00:03:57.329 --> 00:03:59.720 
my first kind of disappointment but I
just<00:03:57.750> thought<00:03:57.959> I<00:03:58.019> would<00:03:58.290> share<00:03:58.620> my<00:03:58.920> opinion

00:03:59.720 --> 00:03:59.730 
just thought I would share my opinion

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:02.810 
just thought I would share my opinion
with<00:03:59.760> you<00:04:00.150> I<00:04:00.750> will<00:04:00.959> try<00:04:01.650> to<00:04:01.680> swatch<00:04:02.370> all<00:04:02.670> of

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:02.820 
with you I will try to swatch all of

00:04:02.820 --> 00:04:06.440 
with you I will try to swatch all of
them<00:04:03.030> and<00:04:04.220> post<00:04:05.220> pictures<00:04:05.459> at<00:04:06.030> the<00:04:06.150> end<00:04:06.299> of

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:06.450 
them and post pictures at the end of

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:09.530 
them and post pictures at the end of
this<00:04:06.540> video<00:04:06.890> but<00:04:07.890> I<00:04:08.250> definitely<00:04:08.910> think<00:04:09.209> this

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:09.540 
this video but I definitely think this

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:11.599 
this video but I definitely think this
is<00:04:09.750> something<00:04:09.989> that<00:04:10.200> you<00:04:10.650> should<00:04:10.950> steer<00:04:11.459> away

00:04:11.599 --> 00:04:11.609 
is something that you should steer away

00:04:11.609 --> 00:04:17.090 
is something that you should steer away
from<00:04:11.790> if<00:04:12.859> you<00:04:14.239> are<00:04:15.239> looking<00:04:15.810> for<00:04:16.229> a<00:04:16.590> blush

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:17.100 
from if you are looking for a blush

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:20.150 
from if you are looking for a blush
palette<00:04:17.370> it<00:04:18.000> might<00:04:18.329> just<00:04:18.750> be<00:04:18.840> safer<00:04:19.380> to<00:04:19.739> spend

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:20.160 
palette it might just be safer to spend

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:23.390 
palette it might just be safer to spend
that<00:04:20.340> extra<00:04:20.549> couple<00:04:21.450> of<00:04:21.630> dollars<00:04:21.840> and<00:04:22.349> get<00:04:23.190> one

00:04:23.390 --> 00:04:23.400 
that extra couple of dollars and get one

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:25.620 
that extra couple of dollars and get one
from<00:04:23.669> somewhere<00:04:24.599> that<00:04:24.630> you<00:04:24.870> know

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:25.630 
from somewhere that you know
