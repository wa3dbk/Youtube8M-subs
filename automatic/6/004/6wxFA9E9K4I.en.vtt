hair<00:02:10.240> and<00:02:10.450> then<00:02:10.990> I<00:02:11.470> just<00:02:12.160> put<00:02:12.459> a<00:02:13.150> satin<00:02:13.540> bonnet

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:13.720 
hair and then I just put a satin bonnet

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:16.440 
hair and then I just put a satin bonnet
on<00:02:14.080> and<00:02:14.500> kind<00:02:14.620> of<00:02:14.709> went<00:02:14.920> to<00:02:14.980> bed<00:02:15.250> and<00:02:15.580> they've

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:16.450 
on and kind of went to bed and they've

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:20.000 
on and kind of went to bed and they've
been<00:02:16.750> in<00:02:17.110> since<00:02:17.740> I<00:02:18.190> put<00:02:18.490> them<00:02:18.610> in<00:02:18.730> less

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:20.010 
been in since I put them in less

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:22.410 
been in since I put them in less
this<00:02:21.010> isn't<00:02:21.280> my<00:02:21.370> first<00:02:21.579> time<00:02:21.730> doing<00:02:22.030> cocoon

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:22.420 
this isn't my first time doing cocoon

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:23.970 
this isn't my first time doing cocoon
crawl<00:02:22.750> so<00:02:23.109> you<00:02:23.230> might<00:02:23.409> want<00:02:23.590> to<00:02:23.650> check<00:02:23.709> out

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:23.980 
crawl so you might want to check out

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:27.839 
crawl so you might want to check out
some<00:02:24.250> other<00:02:24.370> videos<00:02:24.489> of<00:02:25.359> mine<00:02:25.870> if<00:02:26.230> you<00:02:26.950> have

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:30.760 
not seen you know just some of the

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:32.940 
not seen you know just some of the
outcomes<00:02:30.909> of<00:02:31.450> my<00:02:32.019> doing<00:02:32.200> cocoon<00:02:32.560> crawls<00:02:32.799> in

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:32.950 
outcomes of my doing cocoon crawls in

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:35.309 
outcomes of my doing cocoon crawls in
the<00:02:33.040> past<00:02:33.310> now<00:02:34.000> what<00:02:34.239> I'm<00:02:34.359> going<00:02:34.480> to<00:02:34.540> do<00:02:34.719> is<00:02:34.930> I'm

00:02:35.309 --> 00:02:35.319 
the past now what I'm going to do is I'm

00:02:35.319 --> 00:02:37.619 
the past now what I'm going to do is I'm
going<00:02:35.379> to<00:02:35.829> take<00:02:36.010> these<00:02:36.519> down<00:02:36.819> and<00:02:37.150> when<00:02:37.540> you

00:02:37.619 --> 00:02:37.629 
going to take these down and when you

00:02:37.629 --> 00:02:39.929 
going to take these down and when you
create<00:02:38.319> the<00:02:38.500> cocoon<00:02:38.829> curls<00:02:39.189> you're<00:02:39.549> supposed

00:02:39.929 --> 00:02:39.939 
create the cocoon curls you're supposed

00:02:39.939 --> 00:02:41.759 
create the cocoon curls you're supposed
to<00:02:40.030> have<00:02:40.209> a<00:02:40.239> loop<00:02:40.510> and<00:02:40.780> then<00:02:41.230> you're<00:02:41.409> supposed

00:02:41.759 --> 00:02:41.769 
to have a loop and then you're supposed

00:02:41.769 --> 00:02:43.259 
to have a loop and then you're supposed
to<00:02:41.889> have<00:02:42.040> a<00:02:42.069> little<00:02:42.340> tail<00:02:42.579> so<00:02:42.879> I'm<00:02:43.000> just<00:02:43.120> going

00:02:43.259 --> 00:02:43.269 
to have a little tail so I'm just going

00:02:43.269 --> 00:02:45.780 
to have a little tail so I'm just going
to<00:02:43.329> pull<00:02:43.599> on<00:02:43.900> the<00:02:44.019> tail<00:02:44.230> and<00:02:44.620> then<00:02:45.280> the<00:02:45.489> cocoon

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:45.790 
to pull on the tail and then the cocoon

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:48.119 
to pull on the tail and then the cocoon
curl<00:02:46.060> will<00:02:46.209> come<00:02:46.420> down<00:02:46.659> all<00:02:47.290> right<00:02:47.500> so<00:02:48.099> I'm

00:02:48.119 --> 00:02:48.129 
curl will come down all right so I'm

00:02:48.129 --> 00:02:50.280 
curl will come down all right so I'm
going<00:02:48.370> to<00:02:48.430> do<00:02:48.579> that<00:02:48.760> and<00:02:49.090> then<00:02:50.019> I'm<00:02:50.109> going<00:02:50.230> to

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:50.290 
going to do that and then I'm going to

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:52.649 
going to do that and then I'm going to
take<00:02:50.349> these<00:02:50.620> aloose<00:02:51.180> while<00:02:52.180> I<00:02:52.209> take<00:02:52.450> them<00:02:52.629> a

00:02:52.649 --> 00:02:52.659 
take these aloose while I take them a

00:02:52.659 --> 00:02:54.390 
take these aloose while I take them a
loose<00:02:52.870> um<00:02:53.079> I'm<00:02:53.560> going<00:02:53.799> to<00:02:53.859> make<00:02:54.010> sure<00:02:54.159> that<00:02:54.370> i

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:34.790 

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:55.790 

you

00:03:55.790 --> 00:03:55.800 

00:03:55.800 --> 00:04:02.200 

you

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:02.210 

00:04:02.210 --> 00:04:05.830 

all<00:04:03.200> right<00:04:03.410> so<00:04:03.620> these<00:04:04.340> are<00:04:04.520> the<00:04:04.550> results<00:04:04.760> and<00:04:05.300> i

00:04:05.830 --> 00:04:05.840 
all right so these are the results and i

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:08.710 
all right so these are the results and i
kind<00:04:06.140> of<00:04:06.230> think<00:04:06.380> it's<00:04:06.590> okay<00:04:07.220> i'm<00:04:08.120> not<00:04:08.390> really

00:04:08.710 --> 00:04:08.720 
kind of think it's okay i'm not really

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:10.840 
kind of think it's okay i'm not really
pleased<00:04:09.110> with<00:04:09.290> it<00:04:09.410> I<00:04:09.800> kind<00:04:10.010> of<00:04:10.070> picked<00:04:10.460> it<00:04:10.640> out

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:10.850 
pleased with it I kind of picked it out

00:04:10.850 --> 00:04:13.270 
pleased with it I kind of picked it out
also<00:04:11.600> I<00:04:11.990> like<00:04:12.200> the<00:04:12.410> volume<00:04:12.800> when<00:04:12.980> I<00:04:13.010> pick<00:04:13.250> it

00:04:13.270 --> 00:04:13.280 
also I like the volume when I pick it

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:18.900 
also I like the volume when I pick it
out<00:04:13.690> but<00:04:14.690> I<00:04:14.720> don't<00:04:14.990> know<00:04:15.110> I<00:04:15.700> don't<00:04:16.700> know<00:04:16.880> I

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:18.910 
out but I don't know I don't know I

00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:22.270 
out but I don't know I don't know I
think<00:04:19.910> it's<00:04:20.210> okay<00:04:20.750> i<00:04:20.780> think<00:04:21.200> it's<00:04:21.320> just<00:04:21.410> okay<00:04:22.010> i

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:22.280 
think it's okay i think it's just okay i

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:25.360 
think it's okay i think it's just okay i
think<00:04:23.030> i<00:04:23.330> probably<00:04:23.540> with<00:04:24.380> cocoon<00:04:24.740> curls<00:04:25.100> would

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:25.370 
think i probably with cocoon curls would

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:29.680 
think i probably with cocoon curls would
have<00:04:25.610> better<00:04:25.880> results<00:04:26.380> on<00:04:27.790> wet<00:04:28.790> hair<00:04:28.820> maybe<00:04:29.300> I

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:29.690 
have better results on wet hair maybe I

00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:35.530 
have better results on wet hair maybe I
don't<00:04:29.990> know<00:04:30.200> I<00:04:30.740> all<00:04:31.580> know<00:04:31.760> y'all<00:04:33.550> anyway<00:04:34.550> it's

00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:35.540 
don't know I all know y'all anyway it's

00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:38.830 
don't know I all know y'all anyway it's
a<00:04:36.260> journey<00:04:36.560> right<00:04:36.830> so<00:04:37.730> I'm<00:04:38.000> going<00:04:38.270> to<00:04:38.330> continue

a journey right so I'm going to continue

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:41.730 
a journey right so I'm going to continue
to<00:04:39.020> kind<00:04:39.350> of<00:04:39.410> play<00:04:39.560> with<00:04:39.680> this<00:04:40.100> and<00:04:40.670> figure<00:04:41.180> out

00:04:41.730 --> 00:04:41.740 
to kind of play with this and figure out

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:45.940 
to kind of play with this and figure out
exactly<00:04:42.790> what<00:04:43.790> i<00:04:43.820> want<00:04:44.150> to<00:04:44.300> do<00:04:44.510> with<00:04:44.780> it<00:04:44.990> i<00:04:45.410> will

00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:45.950 
exactly what i want to do with it i will

00:04:45.950 --> 00:04:48.700 
exactly what i want to do with it i will
say<00:04:46.160> this<00:04:46.190> about<00:04:46.550> using<00:04:47.090> this<00:04:47.180> combination<00:04:47.810> i

00:04:48.700 --> 00:04:48.710 
say this about using this combination i

00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:52.080 
say this about using this combination i
like<00:04:49.280> i<00:04:49.490> like<00:04:49.880> the<00:04:50.030> hold<00:04:50.270> it's<00:04:50.540> very<00:04:50.840> soft<00:04:51.170> and

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:52.090 
like i like the hold it's very soft and

00:04:52.090 --> 00:04:56.650 
like i like the hold it's very soft and
um<00:04:53.680> yeah<00:04:54.680> i<00:04:54.710> mean<00:04:55.040> i<00:04:55.070> think<00:04:55.190> it<00:04:55.460> came<00:04:55.640> out<00:04:55.700> nice

00:04:56.650 --> 00:04:56.660 
um yeah i mean i think it came out nice

00:04:56.660 --> 00:04:59.200 
um yeah i mean i think it came out nice
in<00:04:57.080> terms<00:04:57.350> of<00:04:57.650> the<00:04:57.860> hold<00:04:58.130> and<00:04:58.370> the<00:04:58.490> definition

00:04:59.200 --> 00:04:59.210 
in terms of the hold and the definition

00:04:59.210 --> 00:05:02.680 
in terms of the hold and the definition
but<00:04:59.870> I<00:05:00.080> think<00:05:00.500> with<00:05:01.160> and<00:05:01.970> I've<00:05:02.090> done<00:05:02.330> cocoon

00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:02.690 
but I think with and I've done cocoon

00:05:02.690 --> 00:05:05.470 
but I think with and I've done cocoon
curls<00:05:03.020> before<00:05:03.500> I<00:05:03.770> think<00:05:04.040> for<00:05:04.460> me<00:05:04.490> they<00:05:05.210> come

00:05:05.470 --> 00:05:05.480 
curls before I think for me they come

00:05:05.480 --> 00:05:09.160 
curls before I think for me they come
out<00:05:05.720> better<00:05:06.020> when<00:05:06.770> I<00:05:06.800> do<00:05:06.920> too<00:05:07.250> two<00:05:08.150> things<00:05:08.390> when

00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:09.170 
out better when I do too two things when

00:05:09.170 --> 00:05:13.090 
out better when I do too two things when
I<00:05:09.410> do<00:05:10.010> a<00:05:10.040> flat<00:05:10.460> twist<00:05:11.500> for<00:05:12.500> at<00:05:12.650> least<00:05:12.770> a<00:05:12.950> little

00:05:13.090 --> 00:05:13.100 
I do a flat twist for at least a little

00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:14.800 
I do a flat twist for at least a little
bit<00:05:13.340> at<00:05:13.490> least<00:05:13.610> four<00:05:13.940> maybe<00:05:14.090> an<00:05:14.330> inch<00:05:14.540> or<00:05:14.750> two

00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:14.810 
bit at least four maybe an inch or two

00:05:14.810 --> 00:05:17.560 
bit at least four maybe an inch or two
inches<00:05:15.100> do<00:05:16.100> a<00:05:16.130> flat<00:05:16.460> twist<00:05:16.760> and<00:05:17.000> then<00:05:17.150> cocoon

00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:17.570 
inches do a flat twist and then cocoon

00:05:17.570 --> 00:05:19.630 
inches do a flat twist and then cocoon
carlet<00:05:18.110> so<00:05:18.560> I<00:05:18.590> think<00:05:18.740> it<00:05:19.010> comes<00:05:19.250> out<00:05:19.400> better

00:05:19.630 --> 00:05:19.640 
carlet so I think it comes out better

00:05:19.640 --> 00:05:22.120 
carlet so I think it comes out better
when<00:05:19.940> i<00:05:19.970> do<00:05:20.060> that<00:05:20.210> and<00:05:20.750> when<00:05:21.050> my<00:05:21.230> hair<00:05:21.530> is<00:05:21.560> not

00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:22.130 
when i do that and when my hair is not

00:05:22.130 --> 00:05:24.550 
when i do that and when my hair is not
soaking<00:05:22.460> wet<00:05:22.760> but<00:05:22.820> when<00:05:23.180> it's<00:05:23.360> damp<00:05:23.780> so<00:05:24.530> i

00:05:24.550 --> 00:05:24.560 
soaking wet but when it's damp so i

00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:28.180 
soaking wet but when it's damp so i
think<00:05:24.860> next<00:05:25.220> time<00:05:25.550> i<00:05:25.580> went<00:05:25.970> to<00:05:26.830> i'm<00:05:27.830> going<00:05:28.070> to

00:05:28.180 --> 00:05:28.190 
think next time i went to i'm going to

00:05:28.190 --> 00:05:30.460 
think next time i went to i'm going to
do<00:05:28.340> that<00:05:28.550> but<00:05:29.210> one<00:05:29.360> of<00:05:29.480> the<00:05:29.540> things<00:05:29.600> i<00:05:29.930> do<00:05:29.990> like

00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:30.470 
do that but one of the things i do like

00:05:30.470 --> 00:05:34.840 
do that but one of the things i do like
about<00:05:31.460> this<00:05:32.150> doing<00:05:32.990> it<00:05:33.140> this<00:05:33.170> way<00:05:33.350> is<00:05:33.830> that<00:05:34.340> my

00:05:34.840 --> 00:05:34.850 
about this doing it this way is that my

00:05:34.850 --> 00:05:39.220 
about this doing it this way is that my
roots<00:05:35.240> are<00:05:35.510> not<00:05:36.020> as<00:05:36.410> I<00:05:37.010> guess<00:05:37.250> taught<00:05:38.140> you<00:05:39.140> know

00:05:39.220 --> 00:05:39.230 
roots are not as I guess taught you know

00:05:39.230 --> 00:05:41.200 
roots are not as I guess taught you know
they're<00:05:39.380> loser<00:05:39.890> because<00:05:40.550> I<00:05:40.640> didn't<00:05:40.910> you<00:05:41.180> know

00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:41.210 
they're loser because I didn't you know

00:05:41.210 --> 00:05:43.150 
they're loser because I didn't you know
twist<00:05:41.600> these<00:05:41.750> and<00:05:42.020> then<00:05:42.140> pin<00:05:42.440> them<00:05:42.680> you<00:05:43.070> know

00:05:43.150 --> 00:05:43.160 
twist these and then pin them you know

00:05:43.160 --> 00:05:45.010 
twist these and then pin them you know
so<00:05:43.310> I'd<00:05:43.430> have<00:05:43.460> like<00:05:43.850> extra<00:05:44.270> definition<00:05:44.420> by<00:05:44.960> the

00:05:45.010 --> 00:05:45.020 
so I'd have like extra definition by the

00:05:45.020 --> 00:05:47.950 
so I'd have like extra definition by the
roots<00:05:45.320> I<00:05:45.560> didn't<00:05:46.010> do<00:05:46.100> that<00:05:46.300> and<00:05:47.300> one<00:05:47.810> of<00:05:47.900> the

00:05:47.950 --> 00:05:47.960 
roots I didn't do that and one of the

00:05:47.960 --> 00:05:50.500 
roots I didn't do that and one of the
great<00:05:48.170> outcomes<00:05:48.650> to<00:05:49.070> me<00:05:49.280> is<00:05:49.550> that<00:05:49.880> I<00:05:49.940> have<00:05:50.270> this

00:05:50.500 --> 00:05:50.510 
great outcomes to me is that I have this

00:05:50.510 --> 00:05:53.680 
great outcomes to me is that I have this
fullness<00:05:50.870> at<00:05:51.260> my<00:05:51.500> roots<00:05:51.830> which<00:05:52.790> allows<00:05:53.120> me<00:05:53.390> to

00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:53.690 
fullness at my roots which allows me to

00:05:53.690 --> 00:05:57.250 
fullness at my roots which allows me to
