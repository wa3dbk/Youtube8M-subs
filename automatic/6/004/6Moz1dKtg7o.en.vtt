00:04:19.449 --> 00:04:19.459 
that I assumed was because like that

00:04:19.459 --> 00:04:21.370 
that I assumed was because like that
dirt<00:04:19.699> you<00:04:19.820> know<00:04:19.910> that<00:04:20.150> 2-pack<00:04:20.600> daredevil<00:04:21.139> body

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:21.380 
dirt you know that 2-pack daredevil body

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:24.550 
dirt you know that 2-pack daredevil body
mold<00:04:22.270> because<00:04:23.270> what's<00:04:23.930> up<00:04:24.050> with<00:04:24.169> this<00:04:24.320> mask

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:24.560 
mold because what's up with this mask

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:31.540 
mold because what's up with this mask
right<00:04:24.770> here<00:04:25.009> that's<00:04:25.160> a<00:04:25.250> true<00:04:30.190> yeah<00:04:31.190> the<00:04:31.340> body

00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:31.550 
right here that's a true yeah the body

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:33.820 
right here that's a true yeah the body
molds<00:04:32.000> actually<00:04:32.449> they<00:04:32.990> have<00:04:33.229> only<00:04:33.440> so<00:04:33.680> much

00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:33.830 
molds actually they have only so much

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:35.860 
molds actually they have only so much
money<00:04:34.250> so<00:04:34.639> the<00:04:34.940> explanation<00:04:35.449> was<00:04:35.570> that<00:04:35.780> the

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:35.870 
money so the explanation was that the

00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:41.710 
money so the explanation was that the
only<00:04:35.990> have<00:04:36.139> so<00:04:36.320> much<00:04:36.410> money<00:04:38.590> and<00:04:40.300> the<00:04:41.300> molds

00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:41.720 
only have so much money and the molds

00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:48.999 
only have so much money and the molds
that<00:04:41.930> are<00:04:46.300> just<00:04:47.300> cost<00:04:47.840> less<00:04:48.259> even<00:04:48.740> though<00:04:48.860> they

00:04:48.999 --> 00:04:49.009 
that are just cost less even though they

00:04:49.009 --> 00:04:54.610 
that are just cost less even though they
already<00:04:49.310> have<00:04:52.000> so<00:04:53.000> that's<00:04:53.539> that's<00:04:54.259> basically

00:04:54.610 --> 00:04:54.620 
already have so that's that's basically

00:04:54.620 --> 00:04:56.999 
already have so that's that's basically
the<00:04:54.800> explanations<00:04:55.370> that<00:04:55.520> you<00:04:55.849> see<00:04:56.210> there<00:04:56.419> you

00:04:56.999 --> 00:04:57.009 
the explanations that you see there you

00:04:57.009 --> 00:04:59.980 
the explanations that you see there you
get<00:04:58.009> the<00:04:58.190> figure<00:04:58.610> with<00:04:58.970> less<00:04:59.240> articulation

00:04:59.980 --> 00:04:59.990 
get the figure with less articulation

00:04:59.990 --> 00:05:01.659 
get the figure with less articulation
than<00:05:00.139> you<00:05:00.229> warrant<00:05:00.620> or<00:05:00.800> it<00:05:01.190> doesn't<00:05:01.430> come<00:05:01.550> out

00:05:01.659 --> 00:05:01.669 
than you warrant or it doesn't come out
