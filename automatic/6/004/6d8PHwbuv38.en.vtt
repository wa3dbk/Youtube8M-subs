00:00:56.350 --> 00:01:00.760
 The work of the 

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:02.829
 rear and front suspension 

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:04.010
 and when we just saw the bikes 

00:01:02.829 --> 00:01:06.920
 track 

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:09.140
 in the most absolute limit ranging from 

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:10.880
 adherence to where the head is 

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:12.650
 of the pilot where the shoulders are with 

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:16.940
 respect to the floor and what is it 

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:19.280
 supporting nothing definitely nothing and if 

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:21.740
 you paid attention also in a 

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:23.900
 moment until I raise my knee like 

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:26.090
 to be able to tilt a little more the 

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:29.660
 I honestly do not know how to do it 

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:32.380
 how you reach that limit of years of 

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:35.140
 training and professionalism 

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:36.430
 can you do this this thing that to 

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:39.219
 We called our attention to 

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:42.570
 beings more normal human beings we 

00:01:39.219 --> 00:01:42.570
 they attract a lot of attention
