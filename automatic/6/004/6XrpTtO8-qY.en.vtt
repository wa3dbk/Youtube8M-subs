00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:40.520 
future so it's a flying Batmobile all
right<00:01:37.409> it's<00:01:37.799> got<00:01:37.950> to<00:01:38.100> be<00:01:38.189> a<00:01:38.220> flying<00:01:38.640> car<00:01:39.200> and<00:01:40.200> I

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
right it's got to be a flying car and I

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:42.530 
right it's got to be a flying car and I
loved<00:01:40.829> how<00:01:41.070> the<00:01:41.130> inside<00:01:41.610> of<00:01:41.759> the<00:01:41.820> cockpit<00:01:42.030> was

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:42.540 
loved how the inside of the cockpit was

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:45.260 
loved how the inside of the cockpit was
almost<00:01:42.899> monochromatic<00:01:43.860> like<00:01:44.820> there<00:01:45.000> was<00:01:45.119> this

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:45.270 
almost monochromatic like there was this

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:47.899 
almost monochromatic like there was this
red<00:01:45.630> light<00:01:45.869> inside<00:01:46.290> the<00:01:46.409> cockpit<00:01:46.759> the<00:01:47.759> bat

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:47.909 
red light inside the cockpit the bat

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:49.940 
red light inside the cockpit the bat
suit<00:01:48.210> was<00:01:48.390> linked<00:01:48.810> to<00:01:48.990> the<00:01:49.409> on-board<00:01:49.590> computer

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:49.950 
suit was linked to the on-board computer

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:52.490 
suit was linked to the on-board computer
so<00:01:50.939> Batman<00:01:51.180> was<00:01:51.570> really<00:01:51.869> the<00:01:51.960> only<00:01:51.990> one<00:01:52.350> who

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.500 
so Batman was really the only one who

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:55.100 
so Batman was really the only one who
could<00:01:52.649> pilot<00:01:53.040> this<00:01:53.159> car<00:01:53.509> the<00:01:54.509> Batmobile<00:01:54.930> was

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:55.110 
could pilot this car the Batmobile was

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:57.620 
could pilot this car the Batmobile was
almost<00:01:55.409> this<00:01:55.799> extension<00:01:56.369> of<00:01:56.759> the<00:01:57.210> bat<00:01:57.360> suit

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:57.630 
almost this extension of the bat suit

00:01:57.630 --> 00:01:59.719 
almost this extension of the bat suit
and<00:01:57.840> it<00:01:58.380> had<00:01:58.500> many<00:01:58.740> of<00:01:58.890> the<00:01:59.009> same<00:01:59.189> features<00:01:59.399> as

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:06.260 
it had stealth technology and visibility
as<00:02:04.200> well<00:02:04.259> as<00:02:04.500> grappling<00:02:05.159> hooks<00:02:05.399> magnetic

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:35.690 
that Eagle Moss chose that that pivotal

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:38.350 
that Eagle Moss chose that that pivotal
moment<00:03:35.750> in<00:03:36.380> the<00:03:36.500> story<00:03:36.700> to<00:03:37.700> display<00:03:38.060> for<00:03:38.299> the

00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:38.360 
moment in the story to display for the

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:42.550 
moment in the story to display for the
diorama<00:03:40.180> now<00:03:41.180> the<00:03:41.239> base<00:03:41.630> is<00:03:41.900> just<00:03:41.959> a

00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:42.560 
diorama now the base is just a

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:47.110 
diorama now the base is just a
continuation<00:03:43.070> of<00:03:43.700> the<00:03:44.000> cave<00:03:44.269> floor<00:03:44.769> and<00:03:46.120> I

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:47.120 
continuation of the cave floor and I

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:49.630 
continuation of the cave floor and I
think<00:03:47.299> the<00:03:47.390> model<00:03:47.750> looks<00:03:48.170> great<00:03:48.650> with<00:03:48.980> the

reminds<00:05:01.130> me<00:05:01.220> of<00:05:01.310> classic<00:05:01.970> Star<00:05:02.240> Trek

00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:02.660

you<00:05:02.960> know<00:05:03.080> like<00:05:03.260> on<00:05:03.560> the<00:05:03.710> bridge<00:05:03.980> of<00:05:04.220> the

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:04.250 
you know like on the bridge of the

00:05:04.250 --> 00:05:05.890 
you know like on the bridge of the
enterprise<00:05:04.340> there<00:05:04.940> are<00:05:05.000> all<00:05:05.150> these<00:05:05.330> square

00:05:05.890 --> 00:05:05.900 
enterprise there are all these square

00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:08.740 
enterprise there are all these square
lights<00:05:06.170> everywhere<00:05:07.040> they<00:05:07.970> probably<00:05:08.210> don't<00:05:08.540> do

00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:08.750 
lights everywhere they probably don't do

00:05:08.750 --> 00:05:11.140 
lights everywhere they probably don't do
anything<00:05:08.990> but<00:05:09.530> it<00:05:09.650> gives<00:05:09.950> it<00:05:10.220> that<00:05:10.370> futuristic

00:05:11.140 --> 00:05:11.150 
anything but it gives it that futuristic

00:05:11.150 --> 00:05:13.000 
anything but it gives it that futuristic
look<00:05:11.330> and<00:05:11.540> I<00:05:12.200> think<00:05:12.380> it<00:05:12.470> does<00:05:12.650> the<00:05:12.680> same<00:05:12.950> thing

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:13.010 
look and I think it does the same thing

00:05:21.430 --> 00:05:21.440 
model it continues underneath mine has a

00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:25.300 
model it continues underneath mine has a
few<00:05:22.150> QC<00:05:23.150> issues<00:05:23.620> but<00:05:24.620> that's<00:05:24.770> okay<00:05:25.040> it's<00:05:25.190> on
