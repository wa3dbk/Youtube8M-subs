00:00:04.120 --> 00:00:14.059
 ordered squad enters at all and all 

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:16.880
 the canvas people comes in scene that is 

00:00:14.059 --> 00:00:20.420
 one of the three most powerful and licked 

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:22.670
 with metz and green has not had many 

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:25.720
 conflicts from here by the way between between 

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:25.720
 bishops the burgher 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:33.239
 very very beautiful monuments and we will 

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:35.989
 have some in a few 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:35.989
 moments gentlemen 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:41.370
 because they scored the miners 

00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:43.140
 even have time to see small 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:45.750
 panic not yet but good blood 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:47.430
 still that's not worth it 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:50.160
 to have reduced the gap in any case 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:52.350
 to have kept a medium spread for 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:54.090
 all this step to get trapped 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:56.640
 in the final cost of the guns of her 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:57.930
 we are close to the minute thirty 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:00.840
 paul he does not want to take a risk 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:02.580
 so they started rolling normal yes 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:04.770
 and no danger two years when 

00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:05.760
 same fact they were six just now 

00:01:04.770 --> 00:01:08.869
 but they made many kilometers 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:11.190
 in front of the fatigue is well there can we 

00:01:08.869 --> 00:01:12.960
 it is sure it is controlled by the barrels 

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:15.330
 dell who still I think some 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:16.860
 resources but there are also others 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:18.930
 teams interested in victory 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:21.840
 stage in this pack is still 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:23.850
 world for by train action and why 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:26.130
 we do not like the beer we see the base 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:27.390
 this white jersey of michel k tosti 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:29.220
 why not an attack of 4 which 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:32.580
 in the end it's pretty much everything 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:35.369
 do 4 what is yesterday he had some 

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:37.590
 legs of fire michalka tons what the 

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:39.660
 Polish team omega pharma quick 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:41.850
 step all in white is finally only 

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:43.020
 50 seconds of the yellow jersey centoni ben 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:44.580
 it may be he who can 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:47.010
 simplify life on this tour de france 

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:49.470
 this weekend of the Italian runner 

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:51.690
 you waited by which 50 seconds 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:55.350
 in large two sides a few kilometers 

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:57.450
 it sounds great but good if the channel 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:02:02.700
 from marl to rhin, which is slow 2 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:04.530
 passes in 14 km 178 more tave gheit 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:07.680
 opened a long time ago since it was 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:09.890
 in 1853 he connects the marne to the rhine 

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:13.220
 simply on channel 

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:16.520
 the marl at the rhine the side channel of the 

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:18.080
 marne connect to the navigable network of 

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:20.410
 the scene towards ile-de-france is not 

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:20.410
 normal 

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:26.380
 all this has all good 

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:42.770
 50 to 15 

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:56.980
 I remained focused even in the tail of 

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:59.950
 platoon with whom 

00:02:56.980 --> 00:03:01.690
 a crossing of town so small 

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:04.260
 traps sometimes on the road needed 

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:06.370
 for cars good traffic 

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:08.230
 but still a lot of caution 

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:09.099
 asked and from the runners side and 

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:10.930
 especially a lot of concentration 

00:03:09.099 --> 00:03:13.060
 especially on a step of almost 5 

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:15.370
 hours it's tiring it's tiring for 

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:16.750
 the morale we have we come to the week of 

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:19.569

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:22.540

00:03:19.569 --> 00:03:24.879
 out of France which is on this channel of 

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:27.430

00:03:24.879 --> 00:03:29.470

 fortifications of vauban it is the point 

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:32.459
 ideal starting point for navigating the 

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:35.560

 it's the richest part that 

00:05:36.860 --> 00:05:42.080
 the building it contrasts with a little 

00:05:39.279 --> 00:05:44.569
 the austerity of the radiant Gothic that 

00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:47.659
 that can be found in the rest of the 

00:05:44.569 --> 00:05:50.749
