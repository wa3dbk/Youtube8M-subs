okay<00:00:17.310> this<00:00:17.609> is<00:00:17.789> a<00:00:17.820> QR<00:00:18.240> code<00:00:18.449> here<00:00:18.779> it's<00:00:18.960> a<00:00:19.020> 2d

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:19.350 
okay this is a QR code here it's a 2d

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:22.040 
okay this is a QR code here it's a 2d
barcode<00:00:19.830> that<00:00:20.430> points<00:00:20.939> to<00:00:21.270> the<00:00:21.630> interface

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:22.050 
barcode that points to the interface

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:24.740 
barcode that points to the interface
that<00:00:22.500> pulls<00:00:22.740> in<00:00:22.920> the<00:00:23.039> stream<00:00:23.340> for<00:00:23.699> indie<00:00:24.000> 1031

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:24.750 
that pulls in the stream for indie 1031

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:28.970 
that pulls in the stream for indie 1031
on<00:00:25.019> online<00:00:25.890> and<00:00:27.140> you<00:00:28.140> might<00:00:28.380> not<00:00:28.560> be<00:00:28.740> able<00:00:28.830> to

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:28.980 
on online and you might not be able to

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:31.880 
on online and you might not be able to
see<00:00:29.189> it<00:00:29.220> all<00:00:29.550> hold<00:00:29.880> it<00:00:30.060> up<00:00:30.240> it<00:00:30.570> says<00:00:30.900> radio<00:00:31.529> dock

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:31.890 
see it all hold it up it says radio dock

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:35.479 
see it all hold it up it says radio dock
so<00:00:32.550> this<00:00:32.820> basically<00:00:33.059> is<00:00:33.660> a<00:00:34.469> radio<00:00:34.829> docking

00:00:35.479 --> 00:00:35.489 
so this basically is a radio docking

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:37.549 
so this basically is a radio docking
station<00:00:35.969> is<00:00:36.090> how<00:00:36.239> I<00:00:36.270> like<00:00:36.570> to<00:00:36.600> look<00:00:36.840> at<00:00:37.020> it<00:00:37.170> this

00:00:37.549 --> 00:00:37.559 
station is how I like to look at it this

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:39.709 
station is how I like to look at it this
could<00:00:37.800> be<00:00:37.950> really<00:00:38.250> big<00:00:38.640> and<00:00:38.969> it<00:00:39.360> could<00:00:39.480> be<00:00:39.600> on

00:00:39.709 --> 00:00:39.719 
could be really big and it could be on

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:42.440 
could be really big and it could be on
the<00:00:39.840> side<00:00:40.050> of<00:00:40.079> a<00:00:40.290> billboard<00:00:40.559> or<00:00:41.370> it<00:00:42.149> could<00:00:42.300> be

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:42.450 
the side of a billboard or it could be

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:45.979 
the side of a billboard or it could be
really<00:00:42.660> small<00:00:43.200> like<00:00:43.910> on<00:00:44.910> this<00:00:45.210> coffee<00:00:45.600> cup

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
really small like on this coffee cup

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:50.080 
really small like on this coffee cup
here<00:00:46.200> indie<00:00:46.620> 1031<00:00:47.430> on<00:00:47.789> one<00:00:48.510> side<00:00:48.780> and<00:00:48.840> then<00:00:49.410> the

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:50.090 
here indie 1031 on one side and then the

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:52.729 
here indie 1031 on one side and then the
QR<00:00:51.090> code<00:00:51.120> on<00:00:51.390> the<00:00:51.750> other<00:00:51.899> side<00:00:52.140> so<00:00:52.379> literally

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:52.739 
QR code on the other side so literally

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:56.389 
QR code on the other side so literally
you<00:00:52.890> could<00:00:53.129> scan<00:00:53.430> this<00:00:53.699> and<00:00:54.890> get<00:00:55.890> you<00:00:56.160> the

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399 
you could scan this and get you the

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:59.630 
you could scan this and get you the
interface<00:00:57.140> you<00:00:58.140> can<00:00:58.170> scan<00:00:58.559> this<00:00:58.800> too<00:00:59.100> and<00:00:59.460> it's

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
interface you can scan this too and it's

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:02.330 
interface you can scan this too and it's
a<00:00:59.699> little<00:00:59.879> bit<00:00:59.969> bigger<00:01:00.149> so<00:01:00.239> we'll<00:01:00.600> use<00:01:00.629> it<00:01:01.340> and

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
a little bit bigger so we'll use it and

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:03.889 
a little bit bigger so we'll use it and
i'll<00:01:02.789> go<00:01:02.940> ahead<00:01:02.969> and<00:01:03.180> show<00:01:03.329> you<00:01:03.539> how<00:01:03.660> that's

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:03.899 
i'll go ahead and show you how that's

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:07.190 
i'll go ahead and show you how that's
done<00:01:04.189> basically<00:01:05.189> I<00:01:05.220> access<00:01:06.150> the<00:01:06.420> software<00:01:06.780> on

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
done basically I access the software on

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:11.060 
done basically I access the software on
my<00:01:07.380> phone<00:01:07.409> the<00:01:07.920> application<00:01:08.549> to<00:01:09.619> read<00:01:10.619> QR

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
my phone the application to read QR

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:14.200 
my phone the application to read QR
codes<00:01:11.310> and<00:01:11.549> there's<00:01:11.700> tons<00:01:12.119> of<00:01:12.360> free<00:01:13.320> software

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:14.210 
codes and there's tons of free software

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:17.510 
codes and there's tons of free software
that<00:01:15.210> you<00:01:15.509> can<00:01:15.720> download<00:01:15.869> and<00:01:16.439> then<00:01:16.950> basically

that you can download and then basically

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:20.510 
that you can download and then basically
I<00:01:17.880> hold<00:01:18.390> the<00:01:18.600> camera<00:01:19.170> in<00:01:19.799> front<00:01:20.009> of<00:01:20.189> the<00:01:20.250> code

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
I hold the camera in front of the code

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:23.480 
I hold the camera in front of the code
and<00:01:20.869> it<00:01:21.869> scans<00:01:22.439> it<00:01:22.770> and<00:01:22.979> then<00:01:23.100> it<00:01:23.220> immediately

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
and it scans it and then it immediately

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:28.749 
and it scans it and then it immediately
takes<00:01:24.090> me<00:01:24.530> to<00:01:25.530> indy<00:01:26.280> 1031<00:01:27.000> online<00:01:27.720> and

00:01:28.749 --> 00:01:28.759 
takes me to indy 1031 online and

00:01:28.759 --> 00:01:32.179 
takes me to indy 1031 online and
hopefully<00:01:29.759> it<00:01:29.880> gets<00:01:30.000> there<00:01:30.299> there<00:01:30.689> we<00:01:30.840> go<00:01:31.189> so

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:32.189 
hopefully it gets there there we go so

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:34.219 
hopefully it gets there there we go so
there's<00:01:32.520> the<00:01:32.790> stream<00:01:33.240> and<00:01:33.270> I'll<00:01:33.720> give<00:01:33.960> us<00:01:34.079> a

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:34.229 
there's the stream and I'll give us a

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:40.039 
there's the stream and I'll give us a
full<00:01:34.680> view<00:01:35.040> again<00:01:36.170> right<00:01:37.170> there<00:01:37.619> and<00:01:39.049> so

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:40.049 
full view again right there and so

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:44.870 
full view again right there and so
basically<00:01:42.110> it's<00:01:43.110> just<00:01:43.320> a<00:01:43.500> gives<00:01:44.100> us<00:01:44.250> a<00:01:44.399> way<00:01:44.430> to

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880 
basically it's just a gives us a way to

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:47.960 
basically it's just a gives us a way to
tie<00:01:45.570> the<00:01:45.630> real<00:01:46.259> to<00:01:46.560> the<00:01:46.680> virtual<00:01:46.860> because<00:01:47.820> we

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:47.970 
tie the real to the virtual because we

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:50.710 
tie the real to the virtual because we
can<00:01:48.149> put<00:01:48.329> that<00:01:48.509> code<00:01:48.810> on<00:01:49.049> anything<00:01:49.439> from

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:50.720 
can put that code on anything from

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:54.490 
can put that code on anything from
magazine<00:01:51.720> and<00:01:51.930> newspaper<00:01:52.850> advertisements<00:01:53.850> to

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:54.500 
magazine and newspaper advertisements to

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:58.459 
magazine and newspaper advertisements to
postcards<00:01:55.500> to<00:01:56.159> business<00:01:56.640> cards<00:01:57.090> to<00:01:57.750> like<00:01:58.290> I

00:01:58.459 --> 00:01:58.469 
postcards to business cards to like I

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:02.319 
postcards to business cards to like I
showed<00:01:58.829> you<00:01:58.890> before<00:01:59.130> coffee<00:01:59.700> coffee<00:02:00.630> cups

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:07.170 
can put it on and the goal is for people

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:08.400 
can put it on and the goal is for people
to<00:02:07.350> start<00:02:07.409> to<00:02:07.799> scan

00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:08.410 
to start to scan

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:20.500 
like having these QR codes you know

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:22.980 
like having these QR codes you know
literally<00:02:20.860> even<00:02:21.340> on<00:02:21.490> telephone<00:02:22.390> poles<00:02:22.420> and

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:22.990 
literally even on telephone poles and

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:25.230 
literally even on telephone poles and
stuff<00:02:23.230> and<00:02:23.470> I'd<00:02:24.220> like<00:02:24.400> I<00:02:24.670> think<00:02:25.000> it'd<00:02:25.090> be<00:02:25.120> a

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:25.240 
stuff and I'd like I think it'd be a

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:27.090 
stuff and I'd like I think it'd be a
great<00:02:25.420> idea<00:02:25.540> to<00:02:25.870> create<00:02:26.170> stickers<00:02:26.770> out<00:02:26.920> of

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:27.100 
great idea to create stickers out of

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:30.240 
great idea to create stickers out of
them<00:02:27.250> so<00:02:27.820> that<00:02:27.850> you<00:02:28.150> can<00:02:28.360> put<00:02:28.600> them<00:02:29.220> so<00:02:30.220> that

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:30.250 
them so that you can put them so that

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:32.070 
them so that you can put them so that
you<00:02:30.430> can<00:02:30.580> give<00:02:30.760> them<00:02:30.790> to<00:02:30.970> high<00:02:31.240> school<00:02:31.480> kids<00:02:31.780> so

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:32.080 
you can give them to high school kids so

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:34.200 
you can give them to high school kids so
that<00:02:32.110> they<00:02:32.260> can<00:02:32.530> use<00:02:32.560> them<00:02:32.860> and<00:02:33.010> stuff<00:02:33.220> I<00:02:33.460> think

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:34.210 
that they can use them and stuff I think

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:36.480 
that they can use them and stuff I think
also<00:02:34.810> as<00:02:35.170> I<00:02:35.290> showed<00:02:35.470> you<00:02:35.500> before<00:02:35.710> you<00:02:36.160> can<00:02:36.310> put

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:41.940 
these to our codes on shirts which is
another<00:02:38.590> way<00:02:39.130> to<00:02:39.270> to<00:02:40.270> create<00:02:41.110> access<00:02:41.350> points
