00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:38.320 
and overall I found it to perform quite

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:40.680 
and overall I found it to perform quite
well<00:02:38.380> especially<00:02:39.370> for<00:02:39.580> the<00:02:40.180> fairly

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:40.690 
well especially for the fairly

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:43.230 
well especially for the fairly
inexpensive<00:02:41.260> price<00:02:41.530> tag<00:02:41.800> of<00:02:42.040> around<00:02:42.580> fifty<00:02:43.150> or

you<00:02:44.320> know<00:02:44.440> this<00:02:44.560> keyboard<00:02:44.800> really<00:02:45.430> isn't<00:02:45.610> too

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:46.030 
you know this keyboard really isn't too

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:48.630 
you know this keyboard really isn't too
bad<00:02:46.270> of<00:02:46.570> a<00:02:46.840> deal<00:02:47.020> I<00:02:47.260> found<00:02:47.800> that<00:02:48.010> typing<00:02:48.430> on

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:48.640 
bad of a deal I found that typing on

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:50.729 
bad of a deal I found that typing on
this<00:02:48.880> keyboard<00:02:48.940> was<00:02:49.840> quite<00:02:50.290> well

00:02:50.729 --> 00:02:50.739 
this keyboard was quite well

00:02:50.739 --> 00:02:53.250 
this keyboard was quite well
they<00:02:50.860> are<00:02:51.010> scissor<00:02:51.340> style<00:02:51.700> keys<00:02:51.970> so<00:02:52.810> of<00:02:53.110> course

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:53.260 
they are scissor style keys so of course

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:54.750 
they are scissor style keys so of course
when<00:02:53.470> they're<00:02:53.560> typing<00:02:53.950> you<00:02:54.160> will<00:02:54.370> get<00:02:54.550> a

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:54.760 
when they're typing you will get a

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:58.199 
when they're typing you will get a
pretty<00:02:55.510> good<00:02:55.930> amount<00:02:56.170> of<00:02:56.610> response<00:02:57.610> back<00:02:57.970> on

00:02:58.199 --> 00:02:58.209 
pretty good amount of response back on

00:02:58.209 --> 00:03:01.710 
pretty good amount of response back on
your<00:02:58.330> finger<00:02:58.690> so<00:02:58.870> it<00:02:59.470> does<00:02:59.590> make<00:02:59.800> typing<00:03:00.720> quite

00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:01.720 
your finger so it does make typing quite

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:06.479 
your finger so it does make typing quite
fast<00:03:02.050> and<00:03:03.450> I<00:03:04.450> really<00:03:04.750> have<00:03:04.959> come<00:03:05.290> to<00:03:05.350> enjoy<00:03:05.830> the

00:03:06.479 --> 00:03:06.489 
fast and I really have come to enjoy the

00:03:06.489 --> 00:03:09.420 
fast and I really have come to enjoy the
overall<00:03:07.060> typing<00:03:07.420> experience<00:03:07.930> as<00:03:08.050> well<00:03:08.350> as<00:03:08.430> the

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:09.430 
overall typing experience as well as the

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:12.030 
overall typing experience as well as the
sort<00:03:09.940> of<00:03:09.970> arc<00:03:10.269> style<00:03:10.630> angle<00:03:11.620> you<00:03:11.769> know<00:03:11.860> it's

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:12.040 
sort of arc style angle you know it's

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:15.509 
sort of arc style angle you know it's
definitely<00:03:12.220> a<00:03:12.430> different<00:03:13.420> feel<00:03:13.780> like<00:03:14.530> I<00:03:14.830> said

00:03:15.509 --> 00:03:15.519 
definitely a different feel like I said

00:03:15.519 --> 00:03:17.699 
definitely a different feel like I said

just fine the keyboard itself is very
lightweight<00:03:49.690> and<00:03:50.140> compact<00:03:50.650> as<00:03:51.220> well<00:03:51.639> but

00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:52.030 
lightweight and compact as well but

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:54.509 
lightweight and compact as well but
unfortunately<00:03:52.690> because<00:03:53.139> of<00:03:53.350> its<00:03:53.590> compact

00:03:54.509 --> 00:03:54.519 
unfortunately because of its compact

00:03:54.519 --> 00:03:56.880 
unfortunately because of its compact
form<00:03:54.850> factor<00:03:54.910> this<00:03:55.690> keyboard<00:03:56.200> does

00:03:56.880 --> 00:03:56.890 
form factor this keyboard does

00:03:56.890 --> 00:03:59.040 
form factor this keyboard does
leave<00:03:57.280> out<00:03:57.490> one<00:03:57.820> very<00:03:58.210> important<00:03:58.900> feature

00:03:59.040 --> 00:03:59.050 
leave out one very important feature

00:03:59.050 --> 00:04:01.950 
leave out one very important feature
found<00:03:59.830> on<00:04:00.070> nearly<00:04:00.640> every<00:04:01.150> keyboard<00:04:01.540> out<00:04:01.690> there

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:01.960 
found on nearly every keyboard out there

00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:04.500 
found on nearly every keyboard out there
which<00:04:02.470> are<00:04:02.650> dedicated<00:04:02.890> arrow<00:04:03.550> key<00:04:03.850> and<00:04:04.030> for

which are dedicated arrow key and for

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:07.530 
which are dedicated arrow key and for
most<00:04:04.630> people<00:04:05.020> this<00:04:05.460> really<00:04:06.460> isn't<00:04:06.670> that<00:04:07.090> big

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:07.540 
most people this really isn't that big

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:09.660 
most people this really isn't that big
of<00:04:07.660> a<00:04:07.780> deal<00:04:07.990> but<00:04:08.380> if<00:04:08.500> you<00:04:08.620> are<00:04:08.770> any<00:04:09.010> type<00:04:09.400> of

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:09.670 
of a deal but if you are any type of

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:13.200 
of a deal but if you are any type of
gamer<00:04:10.150> or<00:04:10.920> rather<00:04:11.920> computer<00:04:12.520> gamers<00:04:12.910> if

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:13.210 
gamer or rather computer gamers if

00:04:13.210 --> 00:04:15.180 
gamer or rather computer gamers if
you're<00:04:13.540> a<00:04:13.570> casual<00:04:14.020> game<00:04:14.290> or<00:04:14.470> hardcore<00:04:14.770> gamer

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:15.190 
you're a casual game or hardcore gamer

00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:18.090 
you're a casual game or hardcore gamer
this<00:04:15.790> is<00:04:16.060> a<00:04:16.330> huge<00:04:16.900> factor<00:04:17.260> because<00:04:17.680> the<00:04:17.709> fact

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:18.100 
this is a huge factor because the fact

00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:21.449 
this is a huge factor because the fact
that<00:04:18.250> it<00:04:18.940> is<00:04:19.780> sort<00:04:20.440> of<00:04:20.470> being<00:04:20.709> replaced<00:04:21.070> by

00:04:21.449 --> 00:04:21.459 
that it is sort of being replaced by

00:04:21.459 --> 00:04:24.450 
that it is sort of being replaced by
this<00:04:21.520> directional<00:04:22.480> key<00:04:22.660> so<00:04:23.440> you<00:04:23.500> really<00:04:24.070> have

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:24.460 
this directional key so you really have

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:28.140 
this directional key so you really have
to<00:04:24.580> push<00:04:24.970> the<00:04:25.960> key<00:04:26.230> into<00:04:26.650> the<00:04:27.550> particular

00:04:28.140 --> 00:04:28.150 
to push the key into the particular

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:30.990 
to push the key into the particular
direction<00:04:28.360> that<00:04:29.260> you<00:04:29.410> want<00:04:29.620> to<00:04:29.880> give<00:04:30.880> the

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:31.000 
direction that you want to give the

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:34.140 
direction that you want to give the
command<00:04:31.270> to<00:04:31.420> now<00:04:32.260> it<00:04:32.590> does<00:04:32.800> work<00:04:33.130> don't<00:04:33.940> get<00:04:34.060> me

00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:34.150 
command to now it does work don't get me

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:36.120 
command to now it does work don't get me
wrong<00:04:34.180> about<00:04:34.450> that<00:04:34.810> but<00:04:35.110> again<00:04:35.440> it's<00:04:35.830> much

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:36.130 
wrong about that but again it's much

00:04:36.130 --> 00:04:39.180 
wrong about that but again it's much
