00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:38.170 
find the half molds to make the layers

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:41.039 
find the half molds to make the layers
so<00:01:39.159> you<00:01:39.670> can<00:01:39.819> make<00:01:39.939> the<00:01:40.060> layers<00:01:40.270> like<00:01:40.569> this

00:01:41.039 --> 00:01:41.049 
so you can make the layers like this

00:01:41.049 --> 00:01:43.769 
so you can make the layers like this
cake<00:01:41.319> how<00:01:41.560> we<00:01:41.619> did<00:01:41.829> here<00:01:42.419> there's<00:01:43.419> a<00:01:43.450> lot<00:01:43.749> of
