they have to and that means improving

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:11.929 
they have to and that means improving
AOC<00:01:10.350> but<00:01:10.680> it<00:01:10.770> also<00:01:10.920> means<00:01:11.220> offering<00:01:11.820> an

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:11.939 
AOC but it also means offering an

buttons<00:01:37.460> will<00:01:37.640> be<00:01:37.670> on<00:01:37.880> your<00:01:38.030> mini-map<00:01:38.270> you<00:01:38.720> can

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:38.870 
buttons will be on your mini-map you can

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:41.650 
buttons will be on your mini-map you can
just<00:01:39.080> type<00:01:39.260> to<00:01:39.500> chat<00:01:39.940> the<00:01:40.940> layout<00:01:41.300> would<00:01:41.480> be

00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:41.660 
just type to chat the layout would be

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:43.750 
just type to chat the layout would be
how<00:01:41.870> you<00:01:41.900> recognize<00:01:42.290> it<00:01:42.560> from<00:01:42.680> before<00:01:42.830> I<00:01:43.220> think

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:43.760 
how you recognize it from before I think

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:46.720 
how you recognize it from before I think
we<00:01:43.850> can<00:01:44.030> probably<00:01:44.150> do<00:01:44.860> the<00:01:45.860> old<00:01:46.070> fixed<00:01:46.370> window

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:46.730 
we can probably do the old fixed window

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:48.580 
we can probably do the old fixed window
layout<00:01:47.060> as<00:01:47.240> well<00:01:47.270> it's<00:01:47.930> so<00:01:48.080> important<00:01:48.440> that

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:48.590 
layout as well it's so important that

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:50.770 
layout as well it's so important that
legacy<00:01:48.830> mode<00:01:49.070> is<00:01:49.190> inclusive<00:01:49.820> you<00:01:50.120> can<00:01:50.240> play<00:01:50.480> on

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:50.780 
legacy mode is inclusive you can play on

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:52.990 
legacy mode is inclusive you can play on
the<00:01:50.840> same<00:01:51.200> servers<00:01:51.650> as<00:01:51.800> everyone<00:01:52.160> else<00:01:52.340> you

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:53.000 
the same servers as everyone else you

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.570 
the same servers as everyone else you
can<00:01:53.360> play<00:01:53.510> in<00:01:53.570> the<00:01:53.720> same<00:01:53.930> areas<00:01:54.440> the<00:01:55.160> community

00:01:55.570 --> 00:01:55.580 
can play in the same areas the community

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:57.280 
can play in the same areas the community
can<00:01:55.730> still<00:01:55.940> play<00:01:56.120> together<00:01:56.300> if<00:01:56.810> you<00:01:56.990> prefer

00:01:57.280 --> 00:01:57.290 
can still play together if you prefer

00:01:57.290 --> 00:01:59.050 
can still play together if you prefer
one<00:01:57.470> combat<00:01:57.800> system<00:01:58.070> over<00:01:58.280> the<00:01:58.370> other<00:01:58.520> you<00:01:58.880> can

00:01:59.050 --> 00:01:59.060 
one combat system over the other you can

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:00.880 
one combat system over the other you can
just<00:01:59.270> choose<00:01:59.510> and<00:01:59.810> get<00:01:59.930> on<00:02:00.050> with<00:02:00.080> get<00:02:00.650> on<00:02:00.770> with

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:00.890 
just choose and get on with get on with

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:04.860 
just choose and get on with get on with
gameplay<00:02:02.350> so<00:02:03.350> you<00:02:03.920> reckon<00:02:04.190> we<00:02:04.280> can<00:02:04.400> get<00:02:04.550> like

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:04.870 
gameplay so you reckon we can get like

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:07.450 
gameplay so you reckon we can get like
almost<00:02:05.870> exactly<00:02:06.350> the<00:02:06.560> same<00:02:06.590> how<00:02:06.980> close<00:02:07.220> do<00:02:07.400> you

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:07.460 
almost exactly the same how close do you

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:09.190 
almost exactly the same how close do you
think<00:02:07.520> it<00:02:07.820> can<00:02:08.030> be<00:02:08.179> I<00:02:08.390> think<00:02:08.450> we<00:02:08.690> can<00:02:08.840> get<00:02:08.990> damn

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:09.200 
think it can be I think we can get damn

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:10.660 
think it can be I think we can get damn
close<00:02:09.470> I<00:02:09.710> mean<00:02:09.920> there<00:02:10.040> are<00:02:10.130> going<00:02:10.220> to<00:02:10.310> be<00:02:10.429> some

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:10.670 
close I mean there are going to be some

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:13.000 
close I mean there are going to be some
areas<00:02:10.970> of<00:02:11.000> difference<00:02:11.480> because<00:02:11.920> legacy<00:02:12.920> mode

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:13.010 
areas of difference because legacy mode

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:14.170 
areas of difference because legacy mode
was<00:02:13.190> still<00:02:13.340> need<00:02:13.490> to<00:02:13.550> be<00:02:13.700> in<00:02:13.820> the<00:02:13.910> modern<00:02:14.150> game

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:14.180 
was still need to be in the modern game

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:16.120 
was still need to be in the modern game
and<00:02:14.600> it'll<00:02:14.780> need<00:02:14.870> to<00:02:14.930> be<00:02:14.990> competitive<00:02:15.560> as<00:02:16.010> well

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:16.130 
and it'll need to be competitive as well

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:18.940 
and it'll need to be competitive as well
so<00:02:16.520> you<00:02:17.390> need<00:02:17.570> to<00:02:17.660> use<00:02:17.780> dual<00:02:17.990> wielding<00:02:18.410> the

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:18.950 
so you need to use dual wielding the

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:21.610 
so you need to use dual wielding the
combat<00:02:19.430> triangle<00:02:19.850> rebalance<00:02:20.330> so<00:02:20.600> magic<00:02:21.470> and

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:21.620 
combat triangle rebalance so magic and

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:23.199 
combat triangle rebalance so magic and
ranged<00:02:21.770> are<00:02:22.070> better<00:02:22.310> you<00:02:22.670> know<00:02:22.760> it<00:02:22.910> will<00:02:23.060> have

00:02:23.199 --> 00:02:23.209 
ranged are better you know it will have

00:02:23.209 --> 00:02:24.490 
ranged are better you know it will have
that<00:02:23.390> yeah<00:02:23.660> of<00:02:23.690> course<00:02:23.989> it's<00:02:24.110> in<00:02:24.230> the<00:02:24.320> same

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:24.500 
that yeah of course it's in the same

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:26.560 
that yeah of course it's in the same
game<00:02:24.739> world<00:02:25.010> it<00:02:25.580> might<00:02:25.820> be<00:02:25.970> the<00:02:26.090> case<00:02:26.300> that

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:26.570 
game world it might be the case that

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:28.720 
game world it might be the case that
we'll<00:02:26.750> need<00:02:26.930> different<00:02:27.230> servers<00:02:27.890> from<00:02:28.340> people

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:28.730 
we'll need different servers from people

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:31.780 
we'll need different servers from people
in<00:02:28.940> PvP<00:02:29.570> to<00:02:30.440> fight<00:02:30.650> each<00:02:30.800> other<00:02:30.980> and<00:02:31.340> with<00:02:31.700> the

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:31.790 
in PvP to fight each other and with the

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:33.790 
in PvP to fight each other and with the
old<00:02:31.910> system<00:02:32.180> or<00:02:32.750> with<00:02:33.140> the<00:02:33.200> new<00:02:33.350> system<00:02:33.709> we

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:33.800 
old system or with the new system we

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:35.470 
old system or with the new system we
might<00:02:33.950> even<00:02:34.010> have<00:02:34.430> servers<00:02:34.700> where<00:02:35.270> both

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:35.480 
might even have servers where both

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:37.420 
might even have servers where both
systems<00:02:35.900> work<00:02:36.170> and<00:02:36.440> can<00:02:36.709> be<00:02:36.860> used<00:02:37.070> to<00:02:37.250> fight

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:37.430 
systems work and can be used to fight

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:38.949 
systems work and can be used to fight
against<00:02:37.670> your<00:02:38.000> interest<00:02:38.360> just<00:02:38.450> to<00:02:38.600> see<00:02:38.810> what

00:02:38.949 --> 00:02:38.959 
against your interest just to see what

00:02:38.959 --> 00:02:41.440 
against your interest just to see what
happens<00:02:39.350> I<00:02:39.620> think<00:02:39.890> however<00:02:40.430> we<00:02:40.730> do<00:02:40.880> it<00:02:41.060> we<00:02:41.330> need

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:41.450 
happens I think however we do it we need

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:43.180 
happens I think however we do it we need
to<00:02:41.510> make<00:02:41.750> sure<00:02:41.930> that<00:02:42.170> if<00:02:42.410> you<00:02:42.530> like<00:02:42.680> you<00:02:42.890> see

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:43.190 
to make sure that if you like you see

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:45.130 
to make sure that if you like you see
you<00:02:43.400> get<00:02:43.610> to<00:02:43.640> continue<00:02:44.150> playing<00:02:44.360> it<00:02:44.690> but<00:02:45.050> we

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:45.140 
you get to continue playing it but we

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:47.949 
you get to continue playing it but we
also<00:02:45.320> have<00:02:45.680> a<00:02:45.709> way<00:02:45.950> for<00:02:46.760> the<00:02:47.209> old<00:02:47.450> system<00:02:47.930> to

00:02:47.949 --> 00:02:47.959 
also have a way for the old system to

00:02:47.959 --> 00:02:49.990 
also have a way for the old system to
come<00:02:48.350> back<00:02:48.620> in<00:02:49.130> a<00:02:49.280> way<00:02:49.400> that<00:02:49.580> doesn't<00:02:49.730> split

00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:50.000 
come back in a way that doesn't split

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:51.729 
come back in a way that doesn't split
the<00:02:50.090> community<00:02:50.570> doesn't<00:02:51.080> mess<00:02:51.350> up<00:02:51.500> all<00:02:51.650> the

00:02:51.729 --> 00:02:51.739 
the community doesn't mess up all the

00:02:51.739 --> 00:02:54.400 
the community doesn't mess up all the
updates<00:02:52.130> or<00:02:52.580> the<00:02:52.760> update<00:02:53.030> rate<00:02:53.270> though<00:02:53.660> that

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:54.410 
updates or the update rate though that

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:57.330 
updates or the update rate though that
we're<00:02:54.530> doing<00:02:54.680> yes<00:02:55.160> that's<00:02:55.640> important<00:02:56.150> I<00:02:56.270> think

00:02:57.330 --> 00:02:57.340 
we're doing yes that's important I think

00:02:57.340 --> 00:03:01.240 
we're doing yes that's important I think
this<00:02:58.340> is<00:02:58.489> the<00:02:58.670> poll<00:02:58.880> kind<00:02:59.480> of<00:02:59.600> to<00:02:59.780> find<00:02:59.989> out<00:03:00.250> the

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:01.250 
this is the poll kind of to find out the

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:03.220 
this is the poll kind of to find out the
overall<00:03:01.760> feeling<00:03:02.090> and<00:03:02.450> whether<00:03:02.630> something

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:03.230 
overall feeling and whether something

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:05.290 
overall feeling and whether something
like<00:03:03.290> a<00:03:03.380> legacy<00:03:03.830> mode<00:03:03.980> is<00:03:04.160> what<00:03:04.370> the<00:03:05.000> players

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:05.300 
like a legacy mode is what the players

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:08.440 
like a legacy mode is what the players
of<00:03:05.570> new<00:03:05.780> and<00:03:06.020> old<00:03:06.110> want<00:03:06.550> it's<00:03:07.550> odd<00:03:07.820> for<00:03:07.850> me<00:03:08.209> we

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:08.450 
of new and old want it's odd for me we

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:10.060 
of new and old want it's odd for me we
just<00:03:08.480> don't<00:03:09.020> have<00:03:09.170> all<00:03:09.320> the<00:03:09.440> answers<00:03:09.470> we<00:03:10.040> don't

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:10.070 
just don't have all the answers we don't

00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:11.620 
just don't have all the answers we don't
know<00:03:10.580> how<00:03:10.790> all<00:03:10.940> these<00:03:11.090> things<00:03:11.360> are<00:03:11.480> going<00:03:11.570> to

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:11.630 
know how all these things are going to

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:13.660 
know how all these things are going to
work<00:03:11.900> with<00:03:12.500> each<00:03:12.650> other<00:03:12.860> because<00:03:13.100> both

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:13.670 
work with each other because both

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:15.370 
work with each other because both
systems<00:03:14.180> have<00:03:14.360> got<00:03:14.540> their<00:03:14.690> own<00:03:14.720> kind<00:03:15.260> of

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:15.380 
systems have got their own kind of

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:18.009 
systems have got their own kind of
unique<00:03:16.040> ways<00:03:16.430> of<00:03:16.820> looking<00:03:16.970> at<00:03:17.239> the<00:03:17.360> game<00:03:17.600> and

00:03:18.009 --> 00:03:18.019 
unique ways of looking at the game and

00:03:18.019 --> 00:03:19.810 
unique ways of looking at the game and
you<00:03:18.470> know<00:03:18.500> working<00:03:18.920> with<00:03:19.130> the<00:03:19.340> players<00:03:19.489> and

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:19.820 
you know working with the players and

00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:21.040 
you know working with the players and
making<00:03:20.120> sure<00:03:20.330> this<00:03:20.480> is<00:03:20.630> a<00:03:20.660> really

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:21.050 
making sure this is a really

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:22.990 
making sure this is a really
collaborative<00:03:21.560> effort<00:03:22.459> I<00:03:22.580> think

00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:23.000 
collaborative effort I think

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.600 
collaborative effort I think
it's<00:03:23.120> a<00:03:23.270> massive<00:03:23.900> deal<00:03:24.140> for<00:03:24.440> us<00:03:24.530> so<00:03:25.160> this<00:03:25.370> folks

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:25.610 
it's a massive deal for us so this folks

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:27.160 
it's a massive deal for us so this folks
a<00:03:25.790> little<00:03:26.000> bit<00:03:26.210> different<00:03:26.660> from<00:03:26.870> the<00:03:26.960> previous

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:27.170

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:35.330 
pure account still be in a viable option

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:37.659 
pure account still be in a viable option
in<00:04:35.419> the<00:04:35.540> wilderness<00:04:35.720> and<00:04:36.200> the<00:04:36.980> simple<00:04:37.640> answer

00:04:37.659 --> 00:04:37.669 
in the wilderness and the simple answer

00:04:37.669 --> 00:04:39.070 
in the wilderness and the simple answer
is<00:04:37.910> we<00:04:38.120> just<00:04:38.390> don't<00:04:38.600> know<00:04:38.780> yet

00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:39.080 
is we just don't know yet

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:40.990 
is we just don't know yet
I<00:04:39.200> think<00:04:39.470> the<00:04:39.650> combat<00:04:40.100> level<00:04:40.190> calculation<00:04:40.880> is

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:41.000 
I think the combat level calculation is

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:42.219 
I think the combat level calculation is
something<00:04:41.300> that's<00:04:41.450> going<00:04:41.630> to<00:04:41.690> be<00:04:41.780> a<00:04:41.810> challenge

00:04:42.219 --> 00:04:42.229 
something that's going to be a challenge
