hey everyone this is a story about my

00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:08.179 
hey everyone this is a story about my
computer<00:00:04.460> well<00:00:05.839> one<00:00:06.839> day<00:00:07.020> I<00:00:07.259> want<00:00:07.859> to<00:00:07.890> turn<00:00:08.099> it

00:00:08.179 --> 00:00:08.189 
computer well one day I want to turn it

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:17.960 
computer well one day I want to turn it
on<00:00:08.309> and<00:00:08.809> it<00:00:09.809> wouldn't<00:00:10.320> turn<00:00:10.559> on<00:00:11.900> what<00:00:12.900> I<00:00:12.929> did<00:00:16.970> as

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:17.970 
on and it wouldn't turn on what I did as

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:19.670 
on and it wouldn't turn on what I did as
I<00:00:18.090> decided<00:00:18.480> to<00:00:18.720> take<00:00:18.869> the<00:00:19.050> motherboard<00:00:19.529> out

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:19.680 
I decided to take the motherboard out

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:21.740 
I decided to take the motherboard out
after<00:00:20.189> about<00:00:20.460> five<00:00:20.880> days<00:00:21.210> of<00:00:21.449> it<00:00:21.539> not<00:00:21.689> being

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:21.750 
after about five days of it not being

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:25.370 
after about five days of it not being
able<00:00:22.170> to<00:00:22.350> be<00:00:22.650> used<00:00:22.949> and<00:00:23.990> what<00:00:24.990> I<00:00:25.050> think

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:25.380 
able to be used and what I think

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:29.120 
able to be used and what I think
happened<00:00:25.560> is<00:00:26.010> there<00:00:26.699> was<00:00:27.769> some<00:00:28.769> metal

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:29.130 
happened is there was some metal

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:31.580 
happened is there was some metal
touching<00:00:29.490> the<00:00:29.609> motherboard<00:00:30.119> or<00:00:30.269> something<00:00:30.720> so

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:31.590 
touching the motherboard or something so

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:34.069 
touching the motherboard or something so
I<00:00:31.650> took<00:00:31.740> it<00:00:31.890> out<00:00:32.070> and<00:00:32.250> placed<00:00:32.730> it<00:00:33.000> on<00:00:33.180> a<00:00:34.020> shoe

00:00:34.069 --> 00:00:34.079 
I took it out and placed it on a shoe

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:39.500 
I took it out and placed it on a shoe
box<00:00:34.790> and<00:00:35.790> I<00:00:36.360> decided<00:00:36.809> to<00:00:37.110> test<00:00:37.879> see<00:00:38.879> if<00:00:38.910> it

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:39.510 
box and I decided to test see if it

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:42.350 
box and I decided to test see if it
would<00:00:39.660> start<00:00:39.960> up<00:00:40.140> and<00:00:40.640> to<00:00:41.640> my<00:00:41.760> surprise<00:00:41.790> it

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:42.360 
would start up and to my surprise it

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:49.490 
would start up and to my surprise it
actually<00:00:42.780> did<00:00:44.510> so<00:00:45.510> here's<00:00:45.809> my<00:00:45.870> computer<00:00:47.660> um<00:00:48.660> to

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500 
actually did so here's my computer um to

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:54.650 
actually did so here's my computer um to
start<00:00:49.800> it<00:00:49.920> up<00:00:50.039> I<00:00:51.170> find<00:00:52.170> the<00:00:52.379> f<00:00:52.559> panel<00:00:53.129> and<00:00:53.660> there

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:54.660 
start it up I find the f panel and there

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:58.810 
start it up I find the f panel and there
should<00:00:54.989> be<00:00:55.199> two<00:00:55.890> metal<00:00:56.250> contacts<00:00:56.820> here<00:00:57.210> that

00:00:58.810 --> 00:00:58.820 
should be two metal contacts here that

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:01.610 
should be two metal contacts here that
governs<00:00:59.820> whether<00:01:00.239> or<00:01:00.809> not<00:01:00.899> the<00:01:01.109> computer<00:01:01.500> will

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620 
governs whether or not the computer will

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:04.520 
governs whether or not the computer will
start<00:01:01.890> up<00:01:02.010> and<00:01:02.219> what<00:01:02.760> this<00:01:02.910> does<00:01:03.049> you<00:01:04.049> connect

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
start up and what this does you connect

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:07.700 
start up and what this does you connect
your<00:01:04.650> power<00:01:05.040> switch<00:01:05.339> to<00:01:05.549> it<00:01:05.670> and<00:01:06.470> when<00:01:07.470> you

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
your power switch to it and when you

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:09.890 
your power switch to it and when you
press<00:01:08.250> your<00:01:08.430> switch<00:01:08.729> it<00:01:09.330> completes<00:01:09.780> the

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900 
press your switch it completes the

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:11.870 
press your switch it completes the
circuit<00:01:10.320> so<00:01:11.010> what<00:01:11.130> I'm<00:01:11.250> going<00:01:11.400> to<00:01:11.460> do<00:01:11.640> is<00:01:11.760> I'm

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
circuit so what I'm going to do is I'm

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:13.910 
circuit so what I'm going to do is I'm
going<00:01:12.000> to<00:01:12.060> complete<00:01:12.420> the<00:01:12.570> circuit<00:01:12.930> with<00:01:13.680> a

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
going to complete the circuit with a

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:20.950 
going to complete the circuit with a
paperclip<00:01:14.430> and<00:01:15.049> it<00:01:16.049> should<00:01:16.290> turn<00:01:16.470> on

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:20.960 

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:39.970 

and<00:01:21.470> it<00:01:21.860> turned<00:01:22.130> on

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:39.980 

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:44.230 

that's<00:01:40.610> my<00:01:40.760> computer<00:01:41.030> and<00:01:42.970> everything<00:01:43.970> works

00:01:44.230 --> 00:01:44.240 
that's my computer and everything works

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:46.960 
that's my computer and everything works
there's<00:01:44.600> my<00:01:44.750> hard<00:01:44.960> drive<00:01:45.460> it's<00:01:46.460> in<00:01:46.550> my<00:01:46.580> cage

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:46.970 
there's my hard drive it's in my cage

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:51.330 
there's my hard drive it's in my cage
hard<00:01:47.810> drive<00:01:48.020> cage<00:01:48.290> there's<00:01:49.100> my<00:01:49.370> DVD<00:01:50.060> drive<00:01:50.090> a

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:51.340 
hard drive cage there's my DVD drive a

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:58.960 
hard drive cage there's my DVD drive a
power<00:01:52.340> supply<00:01:55.690> and<00:01:57.010> for<00:01:58.010> cooling<00:01:58.550> so<00:01:58.910> it

00:01:58.960 --> 00:01:58.970 
power supply and for cooling so it

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:01.410 
power supply and for cooling so it
doesn't<00:01:59.120> get<00:01:59.270> too<00:01:59.330> hot<00:01:59.450> what<00:02:00.440> i<00:02:00.470> did<00:02:00.740> is<00:02:00.950> i

00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:01.420 
doesn't get too hot what i did is i

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:05.770 
doesn't get too hot what i did is i
found<00:02:02.420> the<00:02:02.540> fan<00:02:02.830> regular<00:02:03.830> house<00:02:03.980> man<00:02:04.250> and<00:02:04.780> i

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:05.780 
found the fan regular house man and i

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:11.230 
found the fan regular house man and i
tied<00:02:06.140> paper<00:02:06.440> to<00:02:06.770> it<00:02:07.930> turn<00:02:08.930> it<00:02:09.050> on<00:02:10.120> and<00:02:11.120> it

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:11.240 
tied paper to it turn it on and it

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:13.240 
tied paper to it turn it on and it
guides<00:02:11.510> the<00:02:11.810> air<00:02:12.050> down<00:02:12.380> and<00:02:12.800> into<00:02:13.160> the

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:13.250 
guides the air down and into the

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:19.450 
guides the air down and into the
motherboard<00:02:14.950> so<00:02:15.950> yeah<00:02:17.680> that's<00:02:18.680> pretty<00:02:19.310> much

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:19.460 
motherboard so yeah that's pretty much

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:23.170 
motherboard so yeah that's pretty much
it<00:02:20.920> this<00:02:21.920> is<00:02:22.070> just<00:02:22.310> a<00:02:22.430> temporary<00:02:22.730> thing

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:23.180 
it this is just a temporary thing

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:27.850 
it this is just a temporary thing
obviously<00:02:25.000> just<00:02:26.000> until<00:02:26.330> I<00:02:26.360> can<00:02:26.480> get<00:02:26.960> that

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:27.860 
obviously just until I can get that

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:30.760 
obviously just until I can get that
computer<00:02:28.280> up<00:02:28.520> anything<00:02:28.880> and<00:02:29.530> right<00:02:30.530> now<00:02:30.740> my

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:30.770 
computer up anything and right now my

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:42.600 
computer up anything and right now my
room<00:02:33.790> looks<00:02:34.790> like<00:02:36.160> computer<00:02:37.160> work<00:02:37.430> wearhouse

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:42.610 

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:48.309 

and<00:02:43.180> that's<00:02:43.360> it

00:02:48.309 --> 00:02:48.319 

00:02:48.319 --> 00:02:51.040 

good
