00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:05.670
 hi it's they video site 

00:00:03.389 --> 00:00:07.710
 test.com today i will talk to you 

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:10.590
 of the ultimate flu test of 

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:14.130
 myprotein this accessory that you can 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:15.690
 see so in the image so as his name l 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:19.910
 indicates this accessory in fact and it goes 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:19.910
 serve you in entering your bars 

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:23.750
 so general toasters these are 

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:24.410
 accessories that allow you to 

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:27.890
 different kinds 

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:29.329
 I am between 3 15 and 3 videos 

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:30.669
 different since these are three 

00:00:29.329 --> 00:00:35.690
 different products 

00:00:30.669 --> 00:00:39.170
 so that thanks to that actually it allows 

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:42.230
 actually isolate the muscles 

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:44.149
 work and so you're not going 

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:45.739
 not let go of another bar because of the 

00:00:44.149 --> 00:00:47.960
 grabbing but really because your 

00:00:45.739 --> 00:00:50.120
 muscle will be tired because well 

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:52.670
 often when you hold a bar I 

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:54.890
 think especially during the phases of 

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:57.199
 traction sometimes you still have some 

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:59.989
 juice on the back but here at 

00:00:57.199 --> 00:01:02.570
 quickly because of fatigue at the level of 

00:00:59.989 --> 00:01:04.059
 forward arm and hand so this is what 

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:06.979
 kind of accessory there is going to allow you 

00:01:04.059 --> 00:01:10.729
 to go a little further in in your 

00:01:06.979 --> 00:01:13.130
 some series are thick since in 

00:01:10.729 --> 00:01:14.630
 fact it has been shown that more to 

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:17.750
 Bahrain and thick and more you can 

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:20.210
 save heavy did not win 10 15 pounds 

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:22.300
 I just believe in taking flu 

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:26.329
 so rip faults 

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:27.590
 but hey this one so me I 

00:01:26.329 --> 00:01:29.899
 uses for the bench press 

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:32.149
 so I have them I replace it I 

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:32.450
 replaced my gloves with tehrik 

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:35.479
 influenza 

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:38.540
 so it looks as if you have 

00:01:35.479 --> 00:01:40.820
 so a party in rubber vigils 

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:43.640
 not semi-rigid because when 

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:46.670
 will be sexy but that's enough it's a 

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:50.119
 little thick so that presents two 

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:53.360
 reinforcements goes up it's a little 

00:01:50.119 --> 00:01:55.759
 little bulging yes and another a little more 

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:58.969
 down so that's gone there so corresponds 

00:01:55.759 --> 00:02:02.380
 at the palm of your hand is here at 

00:01:58.969 --> 00:02:07.039
 finger level you have a strap 

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:10.910
 so that is adjustable with a system of 

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:16.459
 scratch and finally so here you have and 

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:18.130
 there foam reinforcements to marry 

00:02:16.459 --> 00:02:20.390
 perfectly the form of allied groups 

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:23.670
 so here you can see the finish 

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:25.880
 it 's good quality 

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:27.989
 so concretely when you put 

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:29.610
 so I put one to show you 

00:02:27.989 --> 00:02:34.170
 how does it work that sounds like 

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:39.300
 that so you grab it so you put 

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:40.950
 your bar here you squeeze and there you 

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:43.440
 can go to work quietly 

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:43.830
 without hurting you at the level of 

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:46.620
 palm 

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:48.360
 so you have a good seizure since 

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:50.880
 you shake his life more perfectly 

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:53.819
 at the bar and you really have a 

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:55.739
 sensation of entry is 

00:02:53.819 --> 00:02:59.310
 interesting and at the same time at the level 

00:02:55.739 --> 00:03:00.959
 wrist seen that you without a return so 

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:02.970
 the wrist so you have a reinforcement 

00:03:00.959 --> 00:03:05.120
 to relieve a little wrist 

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:07.790
 so at this level of his reinforcement there 

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:11.519
 so now I had this tested 

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:15.540
 eight different people so one of whom 

00:03:11.519 --> 00:03:17.940
 that makes ridding heavy is good 

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:19.260
 for him that kind of and found that 

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:21.390
 interesting and me too 

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:23.450
 this part has rubber because 

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:26.430
 with that really you can really 

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:28.079
 work without hurting yourself by 

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:30.900
 against at the level of the wrist reinforcement 

00:03:28.079 --> 00:03:34.739
 he will not let go there his good old 

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:36.420
 strap system since announcing itself 

00:03:34.739 --> 00:03:40.320
 does not stop there the wrist if you 

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:42.510
 want to bend like these and the 

00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:43.920
 tension at the wrist is 

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:45.769
 always strong 

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:49.650
 so some have decreased but good 

00:03:45.769 --> 00:03:52.470
 after that it is accessory which is itself 

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:53.700
 advised since when I tell you that 

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:55.860
 avoids having the 

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:58.050
 the gloves what gloves it's 

00:03:55.860 --> 00:04:00.390
 tear very quickly yet already 

00:03:58.050 --> 00:04:01.500
 bought at 38 some rodez thanks and 

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:04.290
 design and then with children 

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:05.580
 interesting but after four or 

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:08.519
 five months with sweating and 

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:11.130
 cetera since friction on the barÃ§a 

00:04:08.519 --> 00:04:12.840
 are tearing apart while there with this 

00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:14.940
 system there it's cheap and it's true 

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:17.729
 that it's rubber so it resists 

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:20.220
 quite well even at the level of reinforcements 

00:04:17.729 --> 00:04:21.780
 wrists so you have some 

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:23.880
 of old moss and it absorbs a small 

00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:24.180
 little perspiration after each 

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:26.910
 meeting 

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:28.470
 you can dry the whole on 

00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:30.630
 you slip your wrist inside 

00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:32.750
 so the party the rubber part 

00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:35.370
 face the hen tomorrow 

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:37.320
 then you settle around your 

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:38.700
 wrist so what am I going to you 

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:41.160
 explain a little later about 

00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:43.530
 those who have peas is there so 

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:45.720
 good but if it affects the level of 

00:04:43.530 --> 00:04:47.930
 rubber protections but it can 

00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:52.410
 very well is getting too so 

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:54.300
 then we're going to go so the 

00:04:52.410 --> 00:04:56.250
 rubber part around the bar 

00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:58.950
 so what am I doing at this level 

00:04:56.250 --> 00:05:02.580
 it was that I had to go through 

00:04:58.950 --> 00:05:04.440
 below and I take the cross with the 

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:07.410
 inch so really the part in 

00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:08.990
 rubber goes around the bar this 

00:05:07.410 --> 00:05:10.979
 who although when I start doing 

00:05:08.990 --> 00:05:15.330
 pretty fast I really have a good grip 

00:05:10.979 --> 00:05:17.220
 in hand and no worries it does not move 

00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:19.580
 no I can really tight I'm not going 

00:05:17.220 --> 00:05:19.580
 hurt your throat 

00:05:23.330 --> 00:05:29.629
 so that's all for me I you 

00:05:28.069 --> 00:05:33.039
 see you soon for other tests 

00:05:29.629 --> 00:05:33.039
 video tests in point as hi
