i<00:01:46.020> really<00:01:46.500> would<00:01:46.649> do<00:01:46.860> this<00:01:47.210> they<00:01:48.210> at<00:01:48.329> they<00:01:48.540> get

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:48.930 
i really would do this they at they get

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:52.429 
i really would do this they at they get
it<00:01:49.020> on<00:01:49.200> day<00:01:49.680> on<00:01:50.310> the<00:01:50.549> dot<00:01:50.960> nearly<00:01:51.960> all<00:01:52.170> the<00:01:52.229> time

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:52.439 
it on day on the dot nearly all the time

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:53.810 
it on day on the dot nearly all the time
for<00:01:52.619> me<00:01:52.710> i<00:01:52.740> think<00:01:52.979> i<00:01:53.159> think<00:01:53.250> actually<00:01:53.460> every

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:53.820 
for me i think i think actually every

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:55.100 
for me i think i think actually every
time<00:01:53.939> for<00:01:54.060> me<00:01:54.119> but<00:01:54.240> sometimes<00:01:54.630> I<00:01:54.750> ever<00:01:54.869> that

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:55.110 
time for me but sometimes I ever that

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:57.050 
time for me but sometimes I ever that
don't<00:01:55.409> do<00:01:55.530> that<00:01:55.560> but<00:01:56.399> if<00:01:56.490> you're<00:01:56.610> not<00:01:56.700> above<00:01:56.880> it

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.060 
don't do that but if you're not above it

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:58.580 
don't do that but if you're not above it
and<00:01:57.180> get<00:01:57.509> it<00:01:57.540> for<00:01:57.750> me<00:01:57.840> it's<00:01:58.020> the<00:01:58.110> cheapest<00:01:58.500> way

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:58.590 
and get it for me it's the cheapest way

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:01.100 
and get it for me it's the cheapest way
you're<00:01:58.710> gonna<00:01:58.799> find<00:01:59.009> it<00:01:59.219> on<00:01:59.310> day<00:01:59.549> one<00:01:59.790> and<00:02:00.110> so
