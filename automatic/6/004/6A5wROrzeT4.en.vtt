going<00:02:10.160> to<00:02:10.190> show<00:02:10.250> you<00:02:10.460> the<00:02:10.820> inside<00:02:11.000> and<00:02:11.360> then

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:11.480 
going to show you the inside and then

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:15.690 
going to show you the inside and then
when<00:02:11.840> I<00:02:11.870> reach<00:02:12.200> the<00:02:13.010> top<00:02:13.250> there<00:02:13.460> I'm<00:02:13.670> gonna

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:15.700 
when I reach the top there I'm gonna

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:19.750 
when I reach the top there I'm gonna
rebuild<00:02:16.700> it<00:02:17.590> so<00:02:18.590> I<00:02:18.620> also<00:02:18.980> spawned<00:02:19.550> some

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:19.760 
rebuild it so I also spawned some

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:26.520 
rebuild it so I also spawned some
villagers<00:02:20.209> and<00:02:20.450> I<00:02:21.580> believe<00:02:22.580> I<00:02:23.090> have<00:02:23.330> some<00:02:23.720> lag

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:26.530 

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:29.350 

so<00:02:27.530> I've<00:02:27.740> made<00:02:27.980> some<00:02:28.160> villagers<00:02:28.670> as<00:02:28.880> well<00:02:29.120> and

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:29.360 
so I've made some villagers as well and

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:32.290 
so I've made some villagers as well and
here's<00:02:30.290> more<00:02:30.500> of<00:02:30.560> the<00:02:30.800> bedrock<00:02:31.250> that<00:02:31.489> I<00:02:31.520> put<00:02:32.060> to

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:32.300 
here's more of the bedrock that I put to

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:36.250 
here's more of the bedrock that I put to
make<00:02:32.480> my<00:02:32.630> castle<00:02:33.110> but<00:02:34.600> the<00:02:35.600> bedrock<00:02:35.959> wasn't

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:36.260 
make my castle but the bedrock wasn't

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:39.430 
make my castle but the bedrock wasn't
really<00:02:36.530> that<00:02:37.310> good<00:02:37.670> of<00:02:37.700> a<00:02:37.940> choice<00:02:38.209> now<00:02:38.570> there

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:39.440 
really that good of a choice now there

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:41.710 
really that good of a choice now there
was<00:02:39.560> more<00:02:39.890> inside<00:02:40.280> here<00:02:40.580> but<00:02:40.790> when<00:02:41.000> I<00:02:41.030> deleted

00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:41.720 
was more inside here but when I deleted

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:43.870 
was more inside here but when I deleted
the<00:02:41.870> walls<00:02:42.110> some<00:02:42.830> of<00:02:42.950> the<00:02:43.130> stuff<00:02:43.370> went<00:02:43.640> also

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:43.880 
the walls some of the stuff went also

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:47.920 
the walls some of the stuff went also
away<00:02:44.330> so<00:02:44.900> it<00:02:45.830> should<00:02:46.040> be<00:02:46.070> a<00:02:46.190> ladder<00:02:46.489> here<00:02:46.930> but

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:47.930 
away so it should be a ladder here but

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:51.760 
away so it should be a ladder here but
there's<00:02:48.650> no<00:02:48.770> ladder<00:02:48.980> anymore<00:02:49.250> and<00:02:50.770> there's

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:51.770

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:30.970 
in creative mode it is just for building

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:38.820 
in creative mode it is just for building
stuff<00:03:31.209> I<00:03:32.040> had<00:03:33.040> a<00:03:33.280> survival<00:03:34.150> mode<00:03:34.300> as<00:03:34.510> well<00:03:37.830> but

00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:38.830 
stuff I had a survival mode as well but

00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:42.540 
stuff I had a survival mode as well but
I<00:03:38.890> think<00:03:39.900> to<00:03:40.900> build<00:03:41.170> stuff<00:03:41.470> this<00:03:41.709> is<00:03:41.890> the<00:03:42.069> best

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:42.550 
I think to build stuff this is the best

00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:45.960 
I think to build stuff this is the best
thing<00:03:42.790> I'm<00:03:43.630> building<00:03:43.959> like<00:03:44.140> an<00:03:44.940> like<00:03:45.940> a

00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:45.970 
thing I'm building like an like a

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:48.990 
thing I'm building like an like a
defensive<00:03:46.690> watchtower<00:03:47.350> here<00:03:47.739> I<00:03:47.950> have<00:03:48.489> to

right<00:04:48.550> here<00:04:48.610> but<00:04:49.450> the<00:04:49.990> texture<00:04:50.289> pack<00:04:50.560> kind<00:04:50.800> of

00:04:50.909 --> 00:04:50.919 
right here but the texture pack kind of

00:04:50.919 --> 00:04:52.969 
right here but the texture pack kind of
fucked<00:04:51.130> it<00:04:51.250> up<00:04:51.370> so<00:04:51.669> i<00:04:51.700> had<00:04:52.000> to<00:04:52.150> delete<00:04:52.479> it<00:04:52.660> I

couldn't get a blocks right anymore but
I'm<00:04:56.110> just<00:04:56.350> gonna<00:04:56.440> rebuild<00:04:56.800> it<00:04:57.010> I<00:04:57.130> have<00:04:57.250> better

00:04:58.050 --> 00:04:58.060 
I'm just gonna rebuild it I have better

00:04:58.060 --> 00:05:00.840 
I'm just gonna rebuild it I have better
blocks<00:04:58.479> now<00:04:58.690> and<00:04:58.960> they<00:04:59.380> look<00:04:59.680> way<00:05:00.460> cooler<00:05:00.700> than

00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:00.850 
blocks now and they look way cooler than

00:05:00.850 --> 00:05:03.960 
blocks now and they look way cooler than
the<00:05:01.150> other<00:05:01.300> texture<00:05:01.720> pack<00:05:01.930> so<00:05:02.580> it<00:05:03.580> should<00:05:03.940> be

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:03.970 
the other texture pack so it should be

00:05:03.970 --> 00:05:07.500 
the other texture pack so it should be
no<00:05:04.210> problem<00:05:04.240> so<00:05:05.110> if<00:05:05.289> we<00:05:05.320> enter<00:05:05.590> here<00:05:06.180> then<00:05:07.180> I've

00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:07.510 
no problem so if we enter here then I've

00:05:07.510 --> 00:05:10.290 
no problem so if we enter here then I've
placed<00:05:07.870> some<00:05:08.110> seeds<00:05:08.470> here<00:05:08.830> and<00:05:08.979> the<00:05:09.880> ground<00:05:10.000> is

00:05:10.290 --> 00:05:10.300 
placed some seeds here and the ground is

00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:13.230 
placed some seeds here and the ground is
just<00:05:10.630> made<00:05:10.840> out<00:05:11.020> of<00:05:11.169> snow<00:05:11.620> I<00:05:12.100> could<00:05:12.520> delete<00:05:12.880> an

00:05:13.230 --> 00:05:13.240 
just made out of snow I could delete an

00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:13.990 
just made out of snow I could delete an
01

00:05:13.990 --> 00:05:14.000
