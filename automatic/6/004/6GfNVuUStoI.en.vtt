 Pop to create a folder must be placed where we want 

00:01:58.980 --> 00:02:02.130

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:08.219
 that we have a greeting on the most key 

00:02:08.219 --> 00:02:10.979
 or the cross on the left the spur 

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:13.979
 if we press on the cross

 a folder will be displayed and all folders will appear 

00:02:18.719 --> 00:02:22.400
 contained in it and the cross will become a minus sign 

00:02:23.229 --> 00:02:26.480
 This will take care of against the deployed fan

 for example here 

00:02:33.639 --> 00:02:36.069
 we do not press consigned less 

00:02:36.069 --> 00:02:39.069
 hired 

00:02:40.239 --> 00:02:43.179
 once published we want to injure 

00:02:43.179 --> 00:02:46.179
 by clicking on it 

00:02:50.539 --> 00:02:53.539
 suppose that this directory 

00:02:54.579 --> 00:02:57.579
 open the file menu 

00:02:58.609 --> 00:03:01.609
 select new 

00:03:04.159 --> 00:03:07.159
 we select remember the folder option 

00:03:10.109 --> 00:03:12.689
 now still life from the window 

00:03:12.689 --> 00:03:16.730
 right a new folder that has a new folder name 

00:03:17.939 --> 00:03:21.510
 This is the name that today will not be applied by default to the folder that 

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:25.659
 we create in the case of finding another fourth folder named the call 

00:03:25.659 --> 00:03:30.449
 new letter folder between parentheses two new folders of the 46 3 and so 

00:03:30.449 --> 00:03:31.939
 successively 

00:03:31.939 --> 00:03:35.519
 the nobel out by eta can change but we'll see it later 

00:03:39.189 --> 00:03:42.189
 for example, this folder could be named 

00:03:46.449 --> 00:03:49.489
 and we click with the button packed 

00:03:49.489 --> 00:03:53.739
 the button on the left to the side and since in that folder created with the name 

00:03:53.739 --> 00:03:57.159
 I put myself 

00:03:57.159 --> 00:04:00.159
 bit little by little and m 

00:04:01.379 --> 00:04:03.319
 We can see 

00:04:03.319 --> 00:04:06.299
 that exists 

00:04:06.299 --> 00:04:10.230
 directory trees in which we can also create 

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:12.409
 not just folders 

00:04:12.409 --> 00:04:14.159
 we can also create 

00:04:14.159 --> 00:04:17.399
 your spy folder others within them 

00:04:18.099 --> 00:04:19.979
 on several levels 

00:04:19.979 --> 00:04:25.889
 as you can see in this dakar with 150 folder 1 folder 1 point 1 

00:04:26.569 --> 00:04:30.139
 chastening 1 point 1 to 1 and within this we can 

00:04:30.969 --> 00:04:32.400
 even more 

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:34.270
 a new 

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:37.300
 scarpetta 

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:40.300
 let's put x 

00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:46.360
 to delete a folder you have to be first on it 

00:04:49.009 --> 00:04:52.619
 once the folder is selected we do not throw to the standard bar 

00:04:53.569 --> 00:04:56.569
 and press the x icon 

00:04:59.379 --> 00:05:03.589
 and this pop-up window appears asking us for confirmation to eliminate 

00:05:03.589 --> 00:05:06.770
 the folder selected in this case the folder x 

00:05:07.710 --> 00:05:10.349
 and warns us 

00:05:10.349 --> 00:05:14.319
 that all components of this folder die to the recycle bin 

00:05:15.439 --> 00:05:18.439
 we hope to continue 

00:05:19.330 --> 00:05:22.050
 another way to delete folder 

00:05:22.050 --> 00:05:24.289
 pre-select 

00:05:24.289 --> 00:05:27.289
 and also press the suppressed key 

00:05:28.229 --> 00:05:31.819
 with which we will have the same confirmation pop-up window 

00:05:31.819 --> 00:05:34.819
 we give him 

00:05:38.189 --> 00:05:42.550
 eder to remind you that when we delete the default folder or file by viewing it 

00:05:42.549 --> 00:05:45.219
 move to the recycling bin 

00:05:45.219 --> 00:05:49.710
 you can modify the understanding so that you eliminate it directly although that 

00:05:49.709 --> 00:05:52.550
 we will see later 

00:05:52.550 --> 00:05:55.550
 the recycling bin 

00:05:57.770 --> 00:06:00.610
 it's just a 

00:06:00.610 --> 00:06:03.960
 the recycling bin is nothing more than a reserved space 

00:06:04.900 --> 00:06:08.189
 on the hard drive a bit 

00:06:08.189 --> 00:06:09.150
 for what 

00:06:09.150 --> 00:06:11.759
 if you have eliminated an element 

00:06:11.759 --> 00:06:14.759
 Chinese it was necessary that we can get it back 

00:06:15.669 --> 00:06:18.599
 in our case 

00:06:18.599 --> 00:06:20.909
 we see the recycling bin 

00:06:20.909 --> 00:06:23.909
 up to the folder 1 point 1 

00:06:24.520 --> 00:06:28.290
 asks for the motion to subtract ar in the case that if we want to restore it 

00:06:30.509 --> 00:06:33.379
 and also the cart etc 

00:06:33.379 --> 00:06:37.999
 with love double click jaguars to leisure time slot jump with what she 

00:06:37.999 --> 00:06:39.360
 I would go back 

00:06:39.360 --> 00:06:41.150
 make a folder 

00:06:41.150 --> 00:06:42.949
 or the item removed 

00:06:42.949 --> 00:06:45.639
 in the place where 

00:06:45.639 --> 00:06:47.489
 we had eliminated
