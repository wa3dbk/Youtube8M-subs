had<00:02:28.170> a<00:02:28.200> lot<00:02:28.350> of<00:02:28.410> weight<00:02:28.590> to<00:02:28.650> it<00:02:29.150> and<00:02:30.150> just<00:02:30.210> I

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:30.750 
had a lot of weight to it and just I

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:32.720 
had a lot of weight to it and just I
don't<00:02:31.320> know<00:02:31.440> just<00:02:31.650> really<00:02:31.800> really<00:02:32.460> thick<00:02:32.700> and

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:32.730 
don't know just really really thick and

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:36.110 
don't know just really really thick and
nice<00:02:33.030> this<00:02:34.020> it's<00:02:35.010> a<00:02:35.070> really<00:02:35.430> light<00:02:35.640> figure

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:36.120 
nice this it's a really light figure

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:38.150 
nice this it's a really light figure
it's<00:02:36.810> like<00:02:36.870> hollow<00:02:37.170> plastic<00:02:37.410> I<00:02:37.770> think<00:02:37.800> it's

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:38.160 
it's like hollow plastic I think it's

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:41.240 
it's like hollow plastic I think it's
just<00:02:38.370> it<00:02:38.940> doesn't<00:02:39.090> feel<00:02:39.360> as<00:02:40.250> well-constructed

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:41.250 
just it doesn't feel as well-constructed

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:44.990 
just it doesn't feel as well-constructed
as<00:02:41.850> the<00:02:42.660> Red<00:02:42.840> Hulk<00:02:43.020> but<00:02:43.950> then<00:02:44.100> looking<00:02:44.760> in<00:02:44.880> the

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:45.000 
as the Red Hulk but then looking in the

as the Red Hulk but then looking in the
package<00:02:45.420> I<00:02:46.110> actually<00:02:46.950> can't<00:02:47.310> see<00:02:47.490> as<00:02:47.670> much<00:02:47.910> as

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:48.120 
package I actually can't see as much as

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:49.940 
package I actually can't see as much as
I<00:02:48.240> did<00:02:48.450> when<00:02:48.690> it<00:02:49.080> was<00:02:49.200> in<00:02:49.380> the<00:02:49.470> package<00:02:49.800> but

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:14.490 
battle damage to a scam it's just from

00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:16.220 
battle damage to a scam it's just from
the<00:03:14.610> pain<00:03:14.820> it<00:03:15.060> just<00:03:15.240> doesn't<00:03:15.810> look<00:03:15.840> very<00:03:15.990> good

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:16.230 
the pain it just doesn't look very good

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:22.100 
the pain it just doesn't look very good
and<00:03:17.930> that's<00:03:18.930> just<00:03:19.200> first<00:03:19.440> off<00:03:20.870> articulation<00:03:21.870> I

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:22.110 
and that's just first off articulation I

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:24.410 
and that's just first off articulation I
mean<00:03:22.860> the<00:03:23.220> Marvel<00:03:23.520> selects<00:03:23.820> don't<00:03:24.090> have<00:03:24.270> as

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:24.420 
mean the Marvel selects don't have as

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:28.190 
mean the Marvel selects don't have as
much<00:03:24.630> as<00:03:24.900> Marvel<00:03:25.620> Legends<00:03:26.010> but<00:03:26.910> this<00:03:27.360> one<00:03:27.660> has

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:28.200 
much as Marvel Legends but this one has

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:31.340 
much as Marvel Legends but this one has
only<00:03:28.740> about<00:03:29.250> as<00:03:29.490> half<00:03:29.730> as<00:03:29.940> much<00:03:30.209> as<00:03:30.510> the<00:03:31.050> Red

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:31.350 
only about as half as much as the Red

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:35.420 
only about as half as much as the Red
Hulk<00:03:31.500> even<00:03:31.890> I<00:03:32.340> mean<00:03:32.690> it's<00:03:33.690> terrible<00:03:34.290> the<00:03:34.430> there

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:35.430 
Hulk even I mean it's terrible the there

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:37.850 
Hulk even I mean it's terrible the there
is<00:03:35.580> not<00:03:35.790> balls<00:03:36.150> on<00:03:36.360> it<00:03:36.480> head<00:03:36.660> it's<00:03:37.290> just<00:03:37.470> a

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:37.860 
is not balls on it head it's just a

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:40.699 
is not balls on it head it's just a
swivel<00:03:38.600> so<00:03:39.600> I<00:03:39.630> mean<00:03:39.990> that's<00:03:40.200> about<00:03:40.320> as<00:03:40.500> far<00:03:40.650> as

00:03:40.699 --> 00:03:40.709 
swivel so I mean that's about as far as

00:03:40.709 --> 00:03:42.530 
swivel so I mean that's about as far as
you<00:03:40.800> get<00:03:40.950> on<00:03:41.010> that<00:03:41.100> it<00:03:41.610> does<00:03:41.790> have<00:03:42.030> Baldridge

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:42.540

bicep

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:45.020 
bicep

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:49.100 
bicep
there<00:03:46.020> is<00:03:46.200> no<00:03:46.590> elbow<00:03:47.130> movement<00:03:47.400> and<00:03:47.989> there<00:03:48.989> is

00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:49.110

00:03:50.949 --> 00:03:50.959 
a swivel at the wrist

00:03:50.959 --> 00:03:54.979 
a swivel at the wrist
there's<00:03:51.959> no<00:03:52.170> torso<00:03:52.590> movement<00:03:52.860> and<00:03:53.810> there<00:03:54.810> is

00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:00.030 
they just made this out of a an entire

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:04.430 
they just made this out of a an entire
hollow<00:04:00.300> shell<00:04:00.660> and<00:04:01.430> then<00:04:02.430> at<00:04:03.420> the<00:04:03.660> hips<00:04:03.900> it

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:04.440 
hollow shell and then at the hips it

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:06.380 
hollow shell and then at the hips it
goes<00:04:04.650> forward<00:04:05.340> and<00:04:05.430> back<00:04:05.580> a<00:04:05.610> little<00:04:05.880> bit<00:04:06.090> and

00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:06.390 
goes forward and back a little bit and

goes forward and back a little bit and
in<00:04:07.230> and<00:04:07.410> out<00:04:07.850> and<00:04:08.850> there<00:04:09.150> is<00:04:09.330> no<00:04:09.720> Niemann<00:04:10.560> so

00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:10.920 
in and out and there is no Niemann so

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:13.040 
in and out and there is no Niemann so
you're<00:04:11.160> stuck<00:04:11.489> with<00:04:11.640> these<00:04:11.820> these<00:04:12.510> bent<00:04:12.840> leg

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:13.050 
you're stuck with these these bent leg

00:04:13.050 --> 00:04:16.490 
you're stuck with these these bent leg
poses<00:04:13.920> and<00:04:14.840> on<00:04:15.840> the<00:04:16.049> feet

00:04:19.169 --> 00:04:22.700 
it does pivot forward back just a little
bit<00:04:19.730> so<00:04:20.730> and<00:04:21.690> it<00:04:21.989> does<00:04:22.169> have<00:04:22.320> a<00:04:22.350> side-to-side

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:22.710 
bit so and it does have a side-to-side

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:25.730 
bit so and it does have a side-to-side
pivot<00:04:23.310> which<00:04:23.520> is<00:04:23.700> which<00:04:24.180> is<00:04:24.210> always<00:04:24.419> nice

00:04:25.730 --> 00:04:25.740 
pivot which is which is always nice
