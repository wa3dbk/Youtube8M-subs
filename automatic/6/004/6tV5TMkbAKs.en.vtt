00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:14.099
 In this review we will discuss this 

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:14.820
 a great game like splinter cell 

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:17.220
 blacklist 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:19.859
 and we decided to tell you more about 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:22.080
 she will be in the game three passing style 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:24.480
 this ghost is a secretive passage without 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:27.090
 killing panther sneaky enemies 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:29.220
 passing with the elimination of enemies and assault 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:31.260
 not disguising and eliminating all enemies 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:33.210
 the plot of the game takes place after six 

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:35.430
 months after conviction 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:37.680
 the game begins with the fact that the terrorists with 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:40.079
 near asia threatened us to arrange 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:41.219
 a series of attacks if the united states does not stop 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:43.350
 to invade or countries 

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:45.120
 the terrorists created a blacklist in 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:46.800
 which you said threats which are not 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:49.039
 necessarily enforce 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:51.570
 if their requirements are not met 

00:00:49.039 --> 00:00:54.059
 US President personally speaks to Sam 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:56.879
 fisher for help sam agrees but 

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:59.250
 gives your requirements and creates 4 

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:01.770
 Shelone at the head of which becomes himself 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:03.120
 sam phisher age does no harm 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:05.670
 agent combat capability 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:07.740
 on the contrary over the years, Fischer Ing grows stronger 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:09.840
 he simply does not have an open fight 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:11.610
 rivals in a split second sam 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:14.130
 cracks down on a dozen terrorists 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:16.409
 updated system markin exhibit 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:18.869
 makes a phisher out of a mobile machine 

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:19.979
 to kill now memory targets for 

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:22.530
 quick elimination 

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:24.600
 sam can run a couple of tens of meters 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:26.009
 automatically giving away right and left 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:28.409
 accurate headshots 

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:30.329
 in especially hot spots fisher helps 

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:32.369
 air support call 

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:35.080
 the hero looked like his floods 

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:37.240
 overcoming the path to the desmond ancestors 

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:39.640
 assassin's creed agent than ever 

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:41.740
 quick and agile he ease climbs on 

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:44.230
 the roof jumps over cars and 

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:46.330
 clambering over rocks clinging to ledges 

00:01:44.230 --> 00:01:49.000
 apparently parkour in the game will be 

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:50.560
 quite a few from one country to phisher action 

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.630
 looks extremely spectacular 

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:55.360
 action game component worked 

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:57.850
 great however is this what we expect from 

00:01:55.360 --> 00:02:00.010
 new splinter cell entertainment now 

00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:02.680
 surprise no one but good stealth 

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:05.110
 worth its weight in gold and for sure it is his 

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:06.150
 fans of the first parts of the series expects from 

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:08.530
 blacklist 

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:10.360
 developers promise that their opportunity 

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:12.430
 his passing will be present 

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:14.980
 in addition to all sorts of ways to eliminate 

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:17.230
 the phisher will have a new opponent 

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:19.270
 the gadget is not just scanning nearby 

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:21.520
 terrain highlight the soup of enemies but 

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:22.390
 reflecting the structure of the room 

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:24.670
 need to penetrate 

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:27.040
 for example, if you calculate the trajectory 

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:28.810
 enemy movements behind the wall and then 

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:31.030
 certain moment blow up somewhere 

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:33.880
 all enemies will be blown up 

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:35.470
 next to him besides the authors argue 

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:36.600
 that did a great job on 

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:38.020
 spatial distribution 

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:40.480
 light sources 

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:43.450
 the ratio of shadow and light in the location 

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:45.190
 carefully thought out of course the developers 

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:46.630
 assure that the game will be satisfied and 

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:48.760
 fans and cash 

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:50.820
 however, we all understand that 

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:53.050
 armor-piercing heroes and the opportunity itself 

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:56.170
 ruthlessly without remorse 

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:58.090
 exterminate all moving does not stimulate 

00:02:56.170 --> 00:03:00.550
 the game is like a silent passage 

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:02.290
 blacklist looks very nice and 

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:04.650
 effectively and dynamically 

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:06.760
 on this our review comes to an end 

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:09.489
 recall that the game is approximately 

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:11.920

 xbox 360 

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:17.970

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:20.260

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:22.439
 all until new 

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:22.439
