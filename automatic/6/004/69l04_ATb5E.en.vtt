unofficial<00:00:48.320> remake<00:00:48.949> or<00:00:49.510> I<00:00:50.510> mean<00:00:50.690> yeah<00:00:51.109> modern

00:00:51.819 --> 00:00:51.829

retelling<00:00:52.519> you<00:00:52.879> know<00:00:52.969> I<00:00:52.999> mean<00:00:53.210> definitely

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:53.690 
retelling you know I mean definitely

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:55.840 
retelling you know I mean definitely
there<00:00:53.839> are<00:00:53.870> comparisons<00:00:54.379> and<00:00:55.039> similarities

00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:55.850 
there are comparisons and similarities

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:58.779 
there are comparisons and similarities
and<00:00:56.089> I<00:00:56.149> think<00:00:56.449> it<00:00:56.569> was<00:00:56.690> always<00:00:57.109> kind<00:00:57.800> of<00:00:58.129> as

00:00:58.779 --> 00:00:58.789 
and I think it was always kind of as

00:00:58.789 --> 00:01:01.509 
and I think it was always kind of as
opposed<00:00:59.269> to<00:00:59.449> saying<00:00:59.839> oh<00:01:00.170> hey<00:01:00.949> this<00:01:01.219> is<00:01:01.370> what

00:01:01.509 --> 00:01:01.519 
opposed to saying oh hey this is what

00:01:01.519 --> 00:01:02.290 
opposed to saying oh hey this is what
we're<00:01:01.670> doing

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:04.970 
it was kind of an unsaid unspoken

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:07.150 
it was kind of an unsaid unspoken
knowledge<00:01:05.690> that<00:01:05.990> everyone<00:01:06.260> on<00:01:06.500> set<00:01:06.830> kind<00:01:07.040> of

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:07.160 
knowledge that everyone on set kind of

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:10.030

00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:22.780 
situation that they didn't like then

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:24.479 
situation that they didn't like then
everyone<00:03:23.320> would<00:03:23.560> be<00:03:23.769> getting<00:03:24.040> out<00:03:24.250> of<00:03:24.370> their

everyone would be getting out of their
roommate<00:03:24.790> situation<00:03:25.390> so<00:03:25.690> it<00:03:25.750> would<00:03:25.900> just

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:25.930 
roommate situation so it would just

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:30.120 
roommate situation so it would just
cause<00:03:26.350> a<00:03:27.030> uproar<00:03:28.030> at<00:03:28.450> campus<00:03:29.140> and<00:03:29.410> so<00:03:29.650> you<00:03:30.010> know

cause a uproar at campus and so you know

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:32.550 
cause a uproar at campus and so you know
it's<00:03:30.280> not<00:03:30.459> very<00:03:30.700> practical<00:03:30.970> that<00:03:31.510> they<00:03:32.410> could

00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:32.560 
it's not very practical that they could

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:33.900 
it's not very practical that they could
let<00:03:32.680> them<00:03:32.769> move<00:03:32.920> but<00:03:33.070> that's<00:03:33.220> why<00:03:33.400> all<00:03:33.760> that

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:33.910 
let them move but that's why all that

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:35.370
