00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:21.060
 hi to all to the room i hope that 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:22.650
 you are fine 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:24.570
 hysterical today was not 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:26.550
 obviously obvious to guess it's a 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:28.470
 movie that came out at 14 so that's 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:30.240
 talk about the movie 60 seconds chrono that has 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:32.099
 for lead actor nicholas cage 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:33.960
 so for those of you who are 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:35.460
 still a little young it's already a little 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:37.410
 more difficult to know even if you 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:39.059
 see the scene so when you did 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:40.559
 half of the campaign there is a 

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:41.989
 mission with franklin called dead 

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:45.149
 to the cows where you are in this garage 

00:00:41.989 --> 00:00:46.530
 you see on the wall behind there is a 

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:48.090
 list of visible vehicles only 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:48.989
 Ultraviolet 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:50.700
 it makes it invisible ink 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:52.890
 moreover for info the garage is the 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:54.500
 garage to yes if you ever want it 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:56.699
 find in online mode 

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:58.260
 so this scene is a reference to 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:00.719
 the same scene in the movie 60 seconds 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:02.250
 chrono so with nicholas cage in the 

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:03.930
 film to carry out his plan he 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:07.979
 uses the same ink so inked 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:09.750
 invisible and therefore himself the character 

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:11.790
 main he has to fly 50 vehicles in 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:13.350
 only one night so here in the mission 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:15.869
 you can imagine that 50 vehicles 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:17.600
 it's way too much we 've got to go 5 and 

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:20.490
 that's not bad 

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:22.259
 in the movie nicholas cage he has the 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:24.240
 character of mickael the physics of 

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:26.580
 trevor and franklin's knowledge 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:27.780
 it's a coincidence but in any case 

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:30.689
 for my part I think it sticks 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:32.369
 great if you have not seen the movie 

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:34.409
 is not prejudiced because he 

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:36.119
 was released in 2000 even though you 

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:38.430
 look today it's still a great 

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:39.680
 movie by cons you like the action sa 

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:42.689
 mouth from beginning to end 

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:43.950
 a little search on google and you 

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:44.579
 can be easily found in 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:46.590
 streaming 

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:47.670
 after that if any of you who 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:49.950
 has a link to share in 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:52.200
 comment to watch the movie 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:54.689
 it will be even better so here are seven 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:56.969
 easter egg comes to an end in addition it's 

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:58.619
 the end of the stage too in the game I 

00:01:56.969 --> 00:01:59.640
 you say good game good day or good 

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:02.360
 night and see you next time 

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:02.360
