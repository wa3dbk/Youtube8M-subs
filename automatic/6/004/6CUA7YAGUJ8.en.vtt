00:00:16.940 --> 00:00:21.490
 here is the following 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:31.199
 there is the part of the plant that that of the tail 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:36.000
 You cut to separate 

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:44.269
 there to stay like that you what you cut 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:47.790
 he sure you place the leaning plant 

00:00:44.269 --> 00:00:52.040
 this without lenine 

00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:58.439
 the plant is leaning against and makes a cut 

00:00:52.040 --> 00:01:07.280
 same body is there that part of the 

00:00:58.439 --> 00:01:36.780
 right body because here it will fit 

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:43.560
 this piece until he touches the body he 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:49.530
 stir up to him he will move here 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:58.530
 inside and then you'll stick this 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:02:02.210
 if you use the motto if you do not 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:02.210
 you stick right 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:10.340
 that part that makes this movement of the 

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:10.340
 side you make a diagonal cut 

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:18.580

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:27.099
 better to the extent that the county is 

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:30.910
 following are you putting a plan is 

00:02:27.099 --> 00:02:34.660
 because neither of the stone does not leave 

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:36.760
 Coladinho this part po durex or tape and 

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:38.680
 mentor 

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:40.569

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:42.190
 It 's ready 

00:02:40.569 --> 00:02:48.700
 the question is difficult to put this here 

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:52.450
 after entering the body people who 

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:56.430

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:22.500
 the tail 

00:03:22.959 --> 00:03:27.959

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:42.250

 from above how far does the water go 

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:12.810
