00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.470
 halo movie search and welcome to film 

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:06.750
 select we had my wife and I 

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:08.639
 Yesterday had the honor to preview 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:10.320
 was supposed to go on the galaxy 

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:12.030
 can and we have the movies 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:13.650
 looked at five weeks before German 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:16.190
 state release and now comes our 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:16.190
 criticism 

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:22.859
 We are starting now with our expectations 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:24.210
 to love in the movie are gone in 

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:25.859
 So I 'm just a great one 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:27.390
 looked at and that was the first me 

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:29.429
 otherwise never trailer but I have 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:30.929
 somehow looked at it and found the whole thing 

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:32.579
 already a bit cool and thought 

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:33.960
 or the movie can definitely 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:35.399
 something but I have now synonymous 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:36.870
 not promised too much because then you 

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:39.059
 is disappointed too often and the 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:41.040
 movie is so new, so it is not 

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:42.780
 Continuation of something and I am 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:44.520
 actually with something higher 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:45.390
 Expectations input but not with whole 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:46.829
 high expectations 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:49.140
 Of course I have the trailer as well 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:50.340
 seen and I had to say after that 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:51.629
 i have no expectations at all 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:55.020
 I make a mental movie incredible 

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:57.059
 do not say boring and I had 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:59.100
 also totally consider what the animated 

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:01.020
 characters, yes, we were in the cinema 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:03.030
 have sat down and there were then 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:05.100
 first on and last posters of the 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:06.840
 film and you can win this if 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:08.040
 your turn at the end of the video then stays tuned 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:09.390
 can you find out how you like these 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:11.130
 In any case we can win 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:13.080
 for those with an English version 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:14.729
 the movie is good for two hours and that 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:16.470
 good thing about the movie is that really 

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:18.299
 The two hours it has used perfectly 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:19.770
 There are hardly any lengths or none at all 

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:22.080
 Lengths where you thought that would be now 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:24.090
 boring the movie has its story and 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:26.250
 The story is packed there really well 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:28.170
 the film has five main characters the 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:30.750
 main characters come and nobody comes 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:32.159
 too short they are all perfect with 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:34.290
 it should be integrated around the two hours 

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:36.240
 just feel good to you 

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:38.280
 she looks good and it will be on everyone 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:39.840
 Do not be bored with the movie, yes 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:42.329
 the characters that is a great 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:42.760
 keyword because I thought they all had 

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:44.710
 their 

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:46.000
 humor and everyone was really their own 

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:48.070
 character and it is really fun 

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.540
 made him look I have a lot 

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:51.780
 laughed in between was also one 

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:54.160
 a bit emotional but mainly 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:55.300
 incredibly well implemented like this 

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:56.230
 different figures with each other 

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:57.580
 to interact 

00:01:56.230 --> 00:01:59.440
 but that is only because the 

00:01:57.580 --> 00:02:01.030
 Actors also do their roles super well 

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:02.920
 There are in this film I give 

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:04.000
 somehow only chris pratt is the 

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:05.350
 main actor and surrenders to others 

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.360
 four supporting actors i am somehow 

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:09.070
 that all five are main actors and 

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:11.200
 all five do the great and throughout 

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:13.150
 movie are all five said mahle five 

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:14.920
 always permanently present there are 

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:15.910
 no now all the time can be seen 

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:17.530
 chris pratt a bit longer 

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:19.810
 screentime than the others but im 

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:21.520
 All are taken together and 

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:24.070
 together make a super cool team 

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:26.140
 and are super cool characters so will 

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:27.400
 the two animated characters are the more 

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:29.140
 have given a little thought to 

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:31.090
 At the beginning I was totally convinced 

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:32.710
 did not notice that they are animated 

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:34.420
 that it somehow seemed out of place 

00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:36.430
 or artificially no it fit right 

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:37.630
 good in and their characters too 

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:40.000
 super good with the other actors 

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:41.680
 harmonizes the two characters act like this 

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:43.150
 was the super good animated 

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:45.280
 but not just the two characters like 

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:48.040
 super well animated no even the whole 

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:49.660
 world with this movie is about galaxy 

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:51.580
 and travel and that's a lot 

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:54.330
 different worlds and races and everything 

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:56.350
 is very well detailed 

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:59.590
 has been put together or sees everything 

00:02:56.350 --> 00:03:01.060
 visually perfectly cool so it 

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:02.920
 There really is everything in this movie too 

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:04.060
 that's really great from update 

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:05.350
 Can you play the game mass effects 

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:06.760
 maybe somehow the whole movie 

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:08.800
 reminds me somehow of a mixture 

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:10.600
 from mass effect and star from 

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:12.580
 little bit because there are different ones today 

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:15.100
 worlds different races and one has 

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:17.560
 Here's another cool feeling from yes 

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:19.510
 that 's a big world and fat 

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:21.220
 galaxy and that brings that four times before 

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:22.900
 on account of the hot optics 

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:24.910
 sound technically is also technically technical 

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:26.440
 Everything is great and can be taken in the basics 

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:30.130
 I just say that's a really horny 

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:32.500
 action adventure comedy scifi movie is 

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:34.150
 and yes a really great superhero 

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:35.500
 film yes I found especially great on the 

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:37.239
 film that he is not too serious himself 

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:40.360
 takes and a little bit anyway 

00:03:37.239 --> 00:03:41.860
 feel good movie is super funny 

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:43.810
 every case really fun and if 

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:45.459
 you want to get your time why 

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:46.900
 you can see the movie really well what 

00:03:45.459 --> 00:03:48.489
 I can also say that is now 

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:49.770
 my expectation was already high 

00:03:48.489 --> 00:03:51.690
 even over here 

00:03:49.770 --> 00:03:54.060
 has been taken and therefore there's 

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:56.340
 nine out of ten points for me 

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:58.530
 great movie and all marvel fans or 

00:03:56.340 --> 00:04:00.330
 superhero fans should get this one 

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:02.010
 watch film you will definitely not 

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:03.780
 disappointed I also give 9 out of 10 

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:05.040
 score because he is absolutely positive for me 

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:06.470
 I was surprised he really thought 

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:08.250
 he 'll be a bit boring or 

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:08.730
 ridiculous that you are not serious 

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:10.170
 can take 

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:13.050
 but no, the movie is just one 

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:14.340
 really good mood movie and fun 

00:04:13.050 --> 00:04:16.500
 made him look I am 

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:18.360
 went out of the cinema and thought wow 

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:20.760
 when will the resumption finally come? 

00:04:18.360 --> 00:04:22.170
