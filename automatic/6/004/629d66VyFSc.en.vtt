camera or manual settings and that would
that'll<00:01:09.420> if<00:01:10.170> you<00:01:10.439> go<00:01:10.890> like<00:01:11.510> manual<00:01:12.510> settings

00:01:14.410 --> 00:01:14.420 
that'll if you go like manual settings

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:16.760 
that'll if you go like manual settings
what<00:01:15.420> that<00:01:15.600> will<00:01:15.750> do<00:01:15.869> is<00:01:15.900> you<00:01:16.110> can<00:01:16.290> you<00:01:16.590> can

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
what that will do is you can you can

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:19.429 
what that will do is you can you can
change<00:01:17.130> the<00:01:17.340> contrast<00:01:17.850> the<00:01:18.689> sharpness<00:01:19.080> and

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:19.439 
change the contrast the sharpness and

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:22.539 
change the contrast the sharpness and
the<00:01:19.500> exposure<00:01:20.100> and<00:01:20.869> they<00:01:21.869> have<00:01:22.080> different

00:01:22.539 --> 00:01:22.549 
the exposure and they have different

00:01:22.549 --> 00:01:27.890 
the exposure and they have different
levels<00:01:23.549> here<00:01:24.979> that<00:01:25.979> you<00:01:26.130> can<00:01:26.310> do<00:01:26.600> you<00:01:27.600> can<00:01:27.750> also

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900 
levels here that you can do you can also

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:32.420 
levels here that you can do you can also
adjust<00:01:28.799> the<00:01:29.159> metering<00:01:29.579> up<00:01:29.909> here<00:01:30.470> from<00:01:31.470> center

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:32.430 
adjust the metering up here from center

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:35.300 
adjust the metering up here from center
to<00:01:32.670> average<00:01:33.240> to<00:01:33.630> spot<00:01:34.049> I<00:01:34.409> have<00:01:34.770> no<00:01:34.950> idea<00:01:35.189> what

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 
to average to spot I have no idea what

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:36.710 
to average to spot I have no idea what
that<00:01:35.340> is<00:01:35.579> I'll<00:01:35.850> just<00:01:35.880> leave<00:01:36.150> it<00:01:36.180> where<00:01:36.420> it<00:01:36.540> was

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720 
that is I'll just leave it where it was

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:40.670 
that is I'll just leave it where it was
now<00:01:37.590> your<00:01:37.799> third<00:01:39.110> deal<00:01:40.110> that<00:01:40.320> you<00:01:40.470> could

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.680 
now your third deal that you could

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:43.929 
now your third deal that you could
change<00:01:41.250> is<00:01:41.430> the<00:01:41.549> audio<00:01:41.869> you<00:01:42.869> push<00:01:43.110> that<00:01:43.290> on<00:01:43.530> and

00:01:43.929 --> 00:01:43.939 
change is the audio you push that on and

00:01:43.939 --> 00:01:46.969 
change is the audio you push that on and
what<00:01:44.939> you<00:01:45.060> have<00:01:45.240> is<00:01:45.450> a<00:01:45.479> mic<00:01:45.810> sensitivity<00:01:46.140> and

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:46.979 
what you have is a mic sensitivity and

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:51.800 
what you have is a mic sensitivity and
you<00:01:47.030> can<00:01:48.860> flip<00:01:49.860> it<00:01:49.979> up<00:01:50.100> or<00:01:50.220> down<00:01:50.369> it's<00:01:51.270> at<00:01:51.479> 45

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:51.810 
you can flip it up or down it's at 45

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:55.550 
you can flip it up or down it's at 45
and<00:01:52.470> it<00:01:52.530> will<00:01:52.649> go<00:01:52.770> all<00:01:53.040> the<00:01:53.189> way<00:01:53.220> to<00:01:54.140> 59<00:01:55.140> and<00:01:55.470> you

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:55.560 
and it will go all the way to 59 and you

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:59.060 
and it will go all the way to 59 and you
can<00:01:55.770> see<00:01:55.979> where<00:01:56.189> I'm<00:01:56.340> going<00:01:57.560> I've<00:01:58.560> taken<00:01:58.890> that

00:01:59.060 --> 00:01:59.070 
can see where I'm going I've taken that

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:03.230 
can see where I'm going I've taken that
to<00:01:59.219> 49<00:01:59.729> and<00:01:59.759> now<00:02:00.119> I'm<00:02:00.210> going<00:02:00.390> back<00:02:00.479> to<00:02:00.750> 46<00:02:02.240> right

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:03.240 
to 49 and now I'm going back to 46 right

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:04.789 
to 49 and now I'm going back to 46 right
there<00:02:03.540> and<00:02:03.719> then<00:02:03.930> you<00:02:04.049> come<00:02:04.290> back<00:02:04.320> down<00:02:04.530> to

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:04.799 
there and then you come back down to

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:11.000 
there and then you come back down to
your<00:02:06.469> little<00:02:07.469> box<00:02:07.710> here<00:02:08.009> and<00:02:08.129> you<00:02:08.250> apply<00:02:08.550> it

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:11.010 

00:02:11.010 --> 00:02:14.160 

now<00:02:12.010> the<00:02:12.820> camera<00:02:13.180> has<00:02:13.330> a<00:02:13.360> high<00:02:13.720> and<00:02:13.930> a<00:02:13.990> low

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:14.170 
now the camera has a high and a low

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:16.740 
now the camera has a high and a low
switch<00:02:14.700> and<00:02:15.700> I'm<00:02:15.820> not<00:02:15.940> sure<00:02:16.150> if<00:02:16.240> this<00:02:16.360> is<00:02:16.540> meant

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:16.750 
switch and I'm not sure if this is meant

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:22.230 
switch and I'm not sure if this is meant
for<00:02:19.200> in<00:02:20.200> the<00:02:20.440> camera<00:02:20.800> itself<00:02:21.130> or<00:02:21.430> because<00:02:22.120> it

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:22.240 
for in the camera itself or because it

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:23.490 
for in the camera itself or because it
does<00:02:22.390> have<00:02:22.480> a<00:02:22.570> high<00:02:22.750> and<00:02:22.810> low<00:02:22.930> switch<00:02:23.200> in<00:02:23.410> the

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:23.500 
does have a high and low switch in the

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:26.910 
does have a high and low switch in the
camera<00:02:23.860> but<00:02:24.040> on<00:02:24.490> your<00:02:24.610> high<00:02:24.760> switch<00:02:25.650> you<00:02:26.650> can

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:26.920 
camera but on your high switch you can

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:34.800 
camera but on your high switch you can
go<00:02:27.270> from<00:02:28.680> full<00:02:29.680> HD<00:02:30.370> 1080<00:02:31.380> to<00:02:32.380> tall<00:02:32.980> HD<00:02:33.810> 960

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:34.810 
go from full HD 1080 to tall HD 960

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:38.280 
go from full HD 1080 to tall HD 960
action<00:02:35.440> HD<00:02:35.920> or<00:02:36.360> contour<00:02:37.360> HD<00:02:37.540> and<00:02:37.930> I<00:02:37.960> have<00:02:38.110> no

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:38.290 
action HD or contour HD and I have no

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:41.370 
action HD or contour HD and I have no
idea<00:02:38.560> what<00:02:38.740> all<00:02:38.770> this<00:02:39.100> means<00:02:39.390> but<00:02:40.390> it<00:02:40.780> says<00:02:41.140> the

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:41.380 
idea what all this means but it says the
