aggressive race wing that had been
mounted<00:02:24.500> on<00:02:24.769> so<00:02:25.459> we<00:02:25.610> knew<00:02:25.730> we<00:02:25.819> had<00:02:25.850> to<00:02:26.030> replace

00:02:26.229 --> 00:02:26.239 
mounted on so we knew we had to replace

mounted on so we knew we had to replace
the<00:02:26.420> trunk<00:02:26.720> and<00:02:26.959> that<00:02:27.650> was<00:02:27.800> looking<00:02:28.190> to<00:02:28.250> be<00:02:28.340> a

the trunk and that was looking to be a

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:29.590 
the trunk and that was looking to be a
bit<00:02:28.519> of<00:02:28.550> a<00:02:28.670> problem<00:02:28.910> so<00:02:29.180> we<00:02:29.209> went<00:02:29.510> online

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:29.600 
bit of a problem so we went online

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:31.930 
bit of a problem so we went online
started<00:02:30.200> looking<00:02:30.440> around<00:02:30.500> and<00:02:31.430> we<00:02:31.519> found<00:02:31.549> this

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:31.940 
started looking around and we found this

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:34.360 
started looking around and we found this
trunk<00:02:32.299> and<00:02:32.510> wing<00:02:32.959> combo<00:02:33.470> for<00:02:33.980> a<00:02:34.040> really<00:02:34.250> good

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:34.370 
trunk and wing combo for a really good

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:35.710 
trunk and wing combo for a really good
deal<00:02:34.519> and<00:02:34.670> we<00:02:34.910> wanted<00:02:35.180> a<00:02:35.269> wing<00:02:35.480> that<00:02:35.510> was

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:35.720 
deal and we wanted a wing that was

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:37.449 
deal and we wanted a wing that was
really<00:02:36.110> more<00:02:36.260> street<00:02:36.650> oriented<00:02:37.070> instead<00:02:37.310> of<00:02:37.400> a

00:02:37.449 --> 00:02:37.459 
really more street oriented instead of a

00:02:37.459 --> 00:02:40.449 
really more street oriented instead of a
giant<00:02:37.700> Raceway<00:02:38.150> so<00:02:38.780> this<00:02:38.930> is<00:02:39.079> a<00:02:39.110> Zil<00:02:39.560> a<00:02:39.709> wing

00:02:40.449 --> 00:02:40.459

actually<00:03:01.370> very<00:03:01.579> functional<00:03:02.269> wheels<00:03:02.510> they're

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:02.870 
actually very functional wheels they're

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:05.199 
actually very functional wheels they're
forged<00:03:03.350> and<00:03:03.560> the<00:03:03.950> RT<00:03:04.489> stands<00:03:04.820> for<00:03:05.030> rigid

00:03:05.199 --> 00:03:05.209 
forged and the RT stands for rigid

00:03:05.209 --> 00:03:07.660 
forged and the RT stands for rigid
tuning<00:03:05.810> which<00:03:06.380> means<00:03:06.680> they're<00:03:07.010> five<00:03:07.280> to<00:03:07.459> six

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:07.670 
tuning which means they're five to six

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:09.900 
tuning which means they're five to six
percent<00:03:07.820> more<00:03:08.510> rigid<00:03:08.930> than<00:03:09.049> the<00:03:09.500> pre

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:09.910

c28<00:03:10.630> eggs<00:03:10.900> and<00:03:11.200> actually<00:03:12.040> are<00:03:12.250> about<00:03:12.460> a<00:03:12.490> pound

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:12.790 
c28 eggs and actually are about a pound

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:15.480 
c28 eggs and actually are about a pound
lighter<00:03:13.060> so<00:03:14.050> the<00:03:14.080> reason<00:03:14.440> we<00:03:14.560> want<00:03:14.770> a<00:03:14.950> stiffer

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:15.490 
lighter so the reason we want a stiffer

00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:17.070 
lighter so the reason we want a stiffer
and<00:03:15.640> lighter<00:03:15.700> wheel<00:03:16.150> for<00:03:16.420> target<00:03:16.660> new<00:03:16.750> fund<00:03:16.960> is

00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:17.080 
and lighter wheel for target new fund is

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:18.800 
and lighter wheel for target new fund is
that<00:03:17.110> the<00:03:17.290> roads<00:03:17.500> there<00:03:17.710> are<00:03:17.740> super<00:03:18.250> rough

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:18.810 
that the roads there are super rough

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:21.240 
that the roads there are super rough
bedrooms<00:03:19.810> are<00:03:19.960> very<00:03:20.170> common<00:03:20.620> so<00:03:20.830> we<00:03:20.950> need<00:03:21.100> the

00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:21.250 
bedrooms are very common so we need the

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:23.340 
bedrooms are very common so we need the
strongest<00:03:21.790> wheel<00:03:22.120> money<00:03:22.390> can<00:03:22.570> buy<00:03:22.720> and<00:03:23.140> that's

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:23.350 
strongest wheel money can buy and that's

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:25.080 
strongest wheel money can buy and that's
exactly<00:03:23.650> what<00:03:23.950> we've<00:03:24.100> got<00:03:24.310> with<00:03:24.460> these<00:03:24.670> rigid

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:25.090 
exactly what we've got with these rigid

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:27.360 
exactly what we've got with these rigid
tuning<00:03:25.450> wheels<00:03:25.720> we<00:03:26.410> also<00:03:26.560> went<00:03:26.800> with<00:03:26.920> Motegi

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:27.370

Racing forged steel lug nuts and the

00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:31.230 
Racing forged steel lug nuts and the
reason<00:03:30.010> that's<00:03:30.100> important<00:03:30.580> is<00:03:30.670> they're<00:03:31.120> much

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:31.240 
reason that's important is they're much

00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:32.970 
reason that's important is they're much

00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:34.930 
tried before these are a 180 tread wear

00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:37.950 
tried before these are a 180 tread wear
they've<00:04:35.650> got<00:04:35.919> a<00:04:36.030> good<00:04:37.030> siphon<00:04:37.270> good<00:04:37.720> tread

but<00:04:39.490> they're<00:04:39.640> also<00:04:39.760> really<00:04:39.910> really<00:04:40.480> fast<00:04:40.690> in

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:40.840 
but they're also really really fast in
