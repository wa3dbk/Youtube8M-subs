00:01:11.730 --> 00:01:11.740 
area of the fender back out smoother

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:16.170 
area of the fender back out smoother
than<00:01:11.860> it<00:01:11.979> had<00:01:12.250> been<00:01:14.130> it<00:01:15.130> wasn't<00:01:15.520> too<00:01:15.670> bad<00:01:15.700> but<00:01:15.940> I

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:16.180 
than it had been it wasn't too bad but I

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:19.950 
than it had been it wasn't too bad but I
wanted<00:01:16.510> that<00:01:17.010> even<00:01:18.010> the<00:01:18.070> smoother<00:01:18.520> so<00:01:19.510> I<00:01:19.540> could

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:19.960 
wanted that even the smoother so I could

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:23.910 
wanted that even the smoother so I could
use<00:01:20.350> a<00:01:21.070> an<00:01:21.520> even<00:01:22.510> thinner<00:01:22.840> layer<00:01:23.140> of<00:01:23.409> bondo

00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:23.920 
use a an even thinner layer of bondo

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:25.950 
use a an even thinner layer of bondo
than<00:01:24.520> had<00:01:24.820> been<00:01:24.850> previously<00:01:25.180> used<00:01:25.540> when<00:01:25.930> I

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:25.960 
than had been previously used when I

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:29.610 
than had been previously used when I
finally<00:01:26.229> seal<00:01:26.560> this<00:01:26.680> off<00:01:26.860> and<00:01:27.510> I<00:01:28.510> also<00:01:28.720> welded

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:29.620

damage I caused by trying to weld up one
single<00:01:40.330> drill<00:01:40.540> hole<00:01:40.750> right<00:01:40.960> over<00:01:41.200> here<00:01:42.900> what

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:43.900 
single drill hole right over here what

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:44.940 
single drill hole right over here what
happened<00:01:44.140> was<00:01:44.200> I<00:01:44.290> was<00:01:44.380> having<00:01:44.619> trouble

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:44.950 
happened was I was having trouble

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:46.940 
happened was I was having trouble
welding<00:01:45.549> that<00:01:45.700> one<00:01:45.850> hole<00:01:46.119> and<00:01:46.150> I<00:01:46.479> just

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:46.950 
welding that one hole and I just

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:49.320 
welding that one hole and I just
kept-kept<00:01:47.950> Nolan<00:01:48.250> over<00:01:48.340> it<00:01:48.549> and<00:01:48.670> grinding<00:01:49.150> and

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:49.330 
kept-kept Nolan over it and grinding and

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:53.609 
kept-kept Nolan over it and grinding and
and<00:01:51.180> you<00:01:52.180> know<00:01:52.270> trying<00:01:52.810> to<00:01:52.900> weld<00:01:53.080> over<00:01:53.439> it<00:01:53.500> and

00:01:53.609 --> 00:01:53.619 
and you know trying to weld over it and

00:01:53.619 --> 00:01:55.500 
and you know trying to weld over it and
eventually<00:01:53.799> i<00:01:54.070> just<00:01:54.520> made<00:01:54.640> a<00:01:54.670> huge<00:01:54.970> mess<00:01:55.180> of<00:01:55.390> it

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:55.510 
eventually i just made a huge mess of it

00:01:55.510 --> 00:01:59.340 
eventually i just made a huge mess of it
and<00:01:56.700> figured<00:01:57.700> that<00:01:57.850> it<00:01:57.939> was<00:01:58.030> probably<00:01:58.350> best

00:01:59.340 --> 00:01:59.350 
and figured that it was probably best

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:03.030 
and figured that it was probably best
off<00:01:59.590> that<00:01:59.860> i<00:01:59.890> just<00:02:00.450> cut<00:02:01.450> my<00:02:01.570> losses<00:02:01.750> and<00:02:02.110> repair

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:03.040 
off that i just cut my losses and repair

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:07.070 
off that i just cut my losses and repair
this<00:02:03.220> right<00:02:03.490> here<00:02:03.820> with<00:02:03.970> fiberglass<00:02:04.540> and<00:02:04.570> then

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:07.080 
this right here with fiberglass and then

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:10.020 
this right here with fiberglass and then

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:40.590 
or not so I'm a fiberglass over that and
then<00:02:36.720> you<00:02:37.720> know<00:02:38.700> throw<00:02:39.700> some<00:02:39.910> bondo<00:02:40.270> added<00:02:40.540> I

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:40.600 
then you know throw some bondo added I

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:43.380 
then you know throw some bondo added I
might<00:02:40.780> get<00:02:40.960> to<00:02:41.110> that<00:02:41.260> tomorrow<00:02:41.710> and<00:02:42.270> smooth<00:02:43.270> it

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:43.390 
might get to that tomorrow and smooth it

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:49.700 
might get to that tomorrow and smooth it
out<00:02:43.480> throw<00:02:44.380> some<00:02:44.590> coating<00:02:44.890> on<00:02:44.980> the<00:02:45.070> back<00:02:45.250> and

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:49.710 

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:51.960 

and<00:02:50.710> bolt<00:02:50.980> the<00:02:51.100> fender<00:02:51.340> back<00:02:51.490> to<00:02:51.640> the<00:02:51.730> car<00:02:51.940> and

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:51.970 
and bolt the fender back to the car and

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:53.910 
and bolt the fender back to the car and
I'm<00:02:52.630> undecided<00:02:52.930> to<00:02:53.320> sweater<00:02:53.590> or<00:02:53.680> not<00:02:53.800> I'm

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:53.920 
I'm undecided to sweater or not I'm

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:55.650 
I'm undecided to sweater or not I'm
actually<00:02:54.040> going<00:02:54.340> to<00:02:54.400> shoot<00:02:54.610> paint<00:02:54.940> at<00:02:55.180> it<00:02:55.330> I

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:55.660 
actually going to shoot paint at it I

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:57.870 
actually going to shoot paint at it I
may<00:02:56.590> just<00:02:56.800> get<00:02:56.890> the<00:02:57.040> inside<00:02:57.430> edge<00:02:57.610> of<00:02:57.790> it

00:02:57.870 --> 00:02:57.880 
may just get the inside edge of it

00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:03.380 
may just get the inside edge of it
they're<00:03:00.000> just<00:03:01.000> so<00:03:01.120> it's<00:03:01.240> protected<00:03:01.840> but<00:03:02.020> I

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:03.390 
they're just so it's protected but I

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:07.320 
they're just so it's protected but I
also<00:03:04.390> may<00:03:04.810> hold<00:03:05.230> off<00:03:05.410> painting<00:03:05.950> until<00:03:06.190> I<00:03:06.330> you

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:07.330 
also may hold off painting until I you

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:09.030 
also may hold off painting until I you
know<00:03:07.420> get<00:03:07.750> the<00:03:07.900> whole<00:03:08.080> car<00:03:08.380> ready<00:03:08.650> for<00:03:08.950> it

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:09.040 
know get the whole car ready for it

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:10.350 
know get the whole car ready for it
which<00:03:09.160> is<00:03:09.280> not<00:03:09.430> going<00:03:09.520> to<00:03:09.580> be<00:03:09.670> for<00:03:09.850> a<00:03:09.910> long<00:03:10.030> time

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:10.360 
which is not going to be for a long time

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:16.170 
which is not going to be for a long time
so<00:03:13.950> as<00:03:14.950> it<00:03:15.130> is<00:03:15.250> y'all<00:03:15.430> probably<00:03:15.700> just<00:03:16.030> leave

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:16.180 
so as it is y'all probably just leave

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:18.650 
so as it is y'all probably just leave
the<00:03:16.330> whole<00:03:16.480> thing<00:03:16.690> primered<00:03:17.140> i<00:03:17.370> mean<00:03:18.370> the<00:03:18.490> the

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:18.660 
the whole thing primered i mean the the

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:21.300 
the whole thing primered i mean the the
dented<00:03:19.660> area<00:03:19.959> here<00:03:20.410> just<00:03:20.830> getting<00:03:21.010> back<00:03:21.130> to

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:21.310 
dented area here just getting back to

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:23.250 
dented area here just getting back to
this<00:03:21.400> for<00:03:21.610> a<00:03:21.640> moment<00:03:21.790> it's<00:03:22.690> certainly<00:03:22.840> not

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:23.260 
this for a moment it's certainly not

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:26.640 
this for a moment it's certainly not
perfect<00:03:23.320> you<00:03:23.950> can<00:03:24.070> still<00:03:24.310> see<00:03:24.610> it's<00:03:25.470> dented<00:03:26.470> up

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:26.650 
perfect you can still see it's dented up

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:28.020 
perfect you can still see it's dented up
and<00:03:26.800> I<00:03:26.830> probably<00:03:27.040> even<00:03:27.340> caused<00:03:27.640> a<00:03:27.790> little<00:03:27.910> bit

00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:28.030 
and I probably even caused a little bit

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:29.520 
and I probably even caused a little bit
of<00:03:28.150> warping<00:03:28.570> with<00:03:28.720> all<00:03:28.870> the<00:03:28.959> welding<00:03:29.230> I<00:03:29.350> did

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:29.530 
of warping with all the welding I did

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:33.390 
of warping with all the welding I did
but<00:03:29.739> I'm<00:03:30.340> not<00:03:30.580> too<00:03:30.730> worried<00:03:31.030> about<00:03:31.060> that<00:03:32.400> all

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:33.400 
but I'm not too worried about that all

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:34.920 
but I'm not too worried about that all
in<00:03:33.670> all<00:03:33.820> it<00:03:33.970> was<00:03:34.150> a<00:03:34.180> good<00:03:34.450> learning<00:03:34.510> experience

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:34.930 
in all it was a good learning experience

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:37.699 
in all it was a good learning experience
and<00:03:35.560> I'll<00:03:36.010> certainly<00:03:36.310> have<00:03:36.550> better<00:03:37.120> results

00:03:37.699 --> 00:03:37.709 
and I'll certainly have better results

00:03:37.709 --> 00:03:40.550 
and I'll certainly have better results
even<00:03:38.709> the<00:03:38.800> next<00:03:39.070> time<00:03:39.220> I<00:03:39.250> guess<00:03:39.489> the<00:03:39.610> welder<00:03:39.910> so

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:40.560 
even the next time I guess the welder so

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:42.840 
even the next time I guess the welder so
that's<00:03:41.560> where<00:03:41.800> this<00:03:41.920> is<00:03:42.130> for<00:03:42.310> now<00:03:42.400> when<00:03:42.790> you

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:42.850 
that's where this is for now when you

00:03:42.850 --> 00:03:46.740 
that's where this is for now when you
get<00:03:42.940> to<00:03:43.060> work<00:03:43.180> and<00:03:44.340> perhaps<00:03:45.340> show<00:03:45.760> you<00:03:45.820> what<00:03:46.720> I

00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:46.750 
get to work and perhaps show you what I

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:48.150 
get to work and perhaps show you what I
have<00:03:46.930> once<00:03:47.170> i<00:03:47.290> have<00:03:47.440> the<00:03:47.500> fiberglass<00:03:47.920> on<00:03:48.070> the

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:48.160 
have once i have the fiberglass on the

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:52.800 
have once i have the fiberglass on the
car<00:03:50.940> just<00:03:51.940> wanted<00:03:52.180> to<00:03:52.239> take<00:03:52.330> a<00:03:52.390> quick<00:03:52.630> video

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:52.810 
car just wanted to take a quick video

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:55.979 
car just wanted to take a quick video
here<00:03:53.200> before<00:03:53.500> i<00:03:53.530> went<00:03:54.010> any<00:03:54.280> further<00:03:54.519> so<00:03:55.090> in

00:03:55.979 --> 00:03:55.989 
here before i went any further so in

00:03:55.989 --> 00:04:00.120 
here before i went any further so in
order<00:03:56.140> to<00:03:57.090> do<00:03:58.090> fiberglassing<00:03:58.739> first<00:03:59.739> you<00:03:59.950> get

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:00.130 
order to do fiberglassing first you get

00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:06.600 
order to do fiberglassing first you get
fiberglass<00:04:01.090> cheating<00:04:01.600> and<00:04:02.880> you<00:04:03.880> cut<00:04:04.150> out<00:04:05.610> the

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:06.610 
fiberglass cheating and you cut out the

00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:08.970 
fiberglass cheating and you cut out the
size<00:04:06.820> you<00:04:07.090> need<00:04:07.209> roughly<00:04:07.570> now<00:04:08.050> i<00:04:08.110> actually

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:08.980 
size you need roughly now i actually

00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:10.500 
size you need roughly now i actually
have<00:04:09.130> a<00:04:09.160> couple<00:04:09.519> of<00:04:09.700> squares<00:04:10.030> here<00:04:10.300> that<00:04:10.480> i

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:10.510 
have a couple of squares here that i

00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:14.090 
have a couple of squares here that i
just<00:04:10.600> cut<00:04:10.930> out<00:04:11.459> roughly<00:04:12.459> the<00:04:12.610> right<00:04:12.640> size<00:04:13.000> with

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:14.100 
just cut out roughly the right size with

00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:16.259 
just cut out roughly the right size with
you<00:04:15.100> know<00:04:15.160> one<00:04:15.340> or<00:04:15.430> two<00:04:15.550> of<00:04:15.670> these<00:04:15.760> should<00:04:16.120> do

00:04:16.259 --> 00:04:16.269 
you know one or two of these should do

00:04:16.269 --> 00:04:22.230 
you know one or two of these should do
just<00:04:16.510> fine<00:04:16.630> and<00:04:16.989> then<00:04:17.140> what<00:04:18.100> you<00:04:18.130> do<00:04:18.340> is<00:04:21.240> you

00:04:22.230 --> 00:04:22.240 
just fine and then what you do is you

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:28.580 
just fine and then what you do is you
mix<00:04:22.540> up<00:04:22.780> the<00:04:24.240> fiberglass<00:04:25.240> resin<00:04:26.790> with<00:04:27.790> the

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:28.590 
mix up the fiberglass resin with the

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:31.740 
mix up the fiberglass resin with the
liquid<00:04:29.590> hardener<00:04:30.190> according<00:04:31.150> to<00:04:31.270> the<00:04:31.360> ratio

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:31.750 
liquid hardener according to the ratio

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:35.590 
liquid hardener according to the ratio
on<00:04:32.130> the<00:04:33.130> package<00:04:33.520> there

00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:35.600 
on the package there

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:38.860 
on the package there
and<00:04:35.720> then<00:04:36.230> you<00:04:36.410> only<00:04:36.590> have<00:04:36.860> a<00:04:37.480> fairly<00:04:38.480> short

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:38.870 
and then you only have a fairly short

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:44.020 
and then you only have a fairly short
working<00:04:39.620> time<00:04:39.860> I<00:04:41.170> use<00:04:42.170> I<00:04:42.770> cut<00:04:43.220> an<00:04:43.310> old<00:04:43.430> milk

00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:44.030 
working time I use I cut an old milk

00:04:44.030 --> 00:04:45.790 
working time I use I cut an old milk
bottle<00:04:44.420> in<00:04:44.540> half<00:04:44.780> here<00:04:45.050> and<00:04:45.080> I<00:04:45.170> use<00:04:45.320> these<00:04:45.470> as<00:04:45.530> I

00:04:45.790 --> 00:04:45.800 
bottle in half here and I use these as I

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:48.610 
bottle in half here and I use these as I

mixing trays cheap easy to come by
easily<00:04:49.580> disposable<00:04:49.940> and<00:04:50.980> then<00:04:51.980> you<00:04:52.280> uh<00:04:52.870> you

00:05:08.420 --> 00:05:12.100 
resin on the on the fiberglass squares
there<00:05:08.720> and<00:05:09.550> then<00:05:10.550> when<00:05:10.760> it's<00:05:10.910> dry<00:05:11.210> you<00:05:11.540> sand<00:05:12.020> it

00:05:12.100 --> 00:05:12.110 
there and then when it's dry you sand it

00:05:12.110 --> 00:05:16.120 
there and then when it's dry you sand it
smooth<00:05:12.440> and<00:05:14.470> after<00:05:15.470> that's<00:05:15.590> done<00:05:15.860> i'm<00:05:16.010> going

00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:16.130 
smooth and after that's done i'm going

00:05:16.130 --> 00:05:18.820 
smooth and after that's done i'm going
to<00:05:16.190> bondo<00:05:16.490> over<00:05:16.760> it<00:05:16.850> so<00:05:17.450> i'll<00:05:18.020> show<00:05:18.590> you<00:05:18.650> that

00:05:18.820 --> 00:05:18.830 
to bondo over it so i'll show you that

00:05:18.830 --> 00:05:21.610 
to bondo over it so i'll show you that
all<00:05:18.950> step<00:05:19.220> by<00:05:19.370> step<00:05:19.610> and<00:05:19.870> I'll<00:05:20.870> probably<00:05:21.080> have

00:05:21.610 --> 00:05:21.620 
all step by step and I'll probably have

00:05:21.620 --> 00:05:27.070 
all step by step and I'll probably have
to<00:05:21.650> continue<00:05:22.070> this<00:05:22.100> video<00:05:22.460> tomorrow<00:05:25.870> well<00:05:26.870> it

00:05:27.070 --> 00:05:27.080 
to continue this video tomorrow well it

00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:28.450 
to continue this video tomorrow well it
looks<00:05:27.110> like<00:05:27.350> i'm<00:05:27.530> definitely<00:05:28.100> going<00:05:28.280> to<00:05:28.370> be

00:05:28.450 --> 00:05:28.460 
looks like i'm definitely going to be

00:05:28.460 --> 00:05:30.700 
looks like i'm definitely going to be
continuing<00:05:29.000> this<00:05:29.120> tomorrow<00:05:29.600> you<00:05:30.410> can<00:05:30.560> see

00:05:30.700 --> 00:05:30.710 
continuing this tomorrow you can see

00:05:30.710 --> 00:05:33.970 
continuing this tomorrow you can see
here<00:05:31.040> I<00:05:31.070> have<00:05:31.190> the<00:05:31.430> I<00:05:32.380> have<00:05:33.380> the<00:05:33.530> fiberglass

00:05:33.970 --> 00:05:33.980 
here I have the I have the fiberglass

00:05:33.980 --> 00:05:36.460 
here I have the I have the fiberglass
applied<00:05:34.400> that<00:05:34.700> is<00:05:34.940> all<00:05:35.210> three<00:05:35.660> layers<00:05:36.110> there

00:05:36.460 --> 00:05:36.470 
applied that is all three layers there

00:05:36.470 --> 00:05:38.680 
applied that is all three layers there
and<00:05:36.650> you<00:05:36.710> see<00:05:36.890> the<00:05:37.070> fiber<00:05:37.550> less<00:05:37.820> and<00:05:38.150> the<00:05:38.330> resin

00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:38.690 
and you see the fiber less and the resin

00:05:38.690 --> 00:05:44.560 
and you see the fiber less and the resin
and<00:05:39.370> I<00:05:40.370> think<00:05:40.580> it<00:05:40.700> is<00:05:42.910> setting<00:05:43.910> up<00:05:44.030> pretty

00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:44.570 
and I think it is setting up pretty

00:05:44.570 --> 00:05:50.190 
and I think it is setting up pretty
quickly<00:05:44.840> they're<00:05:45.880> still<00:05:47.380> still<00:05:48.380> wet<00:05:48.590> though<00:05:48.800> I

00:05:50.190 --> 00:05:50.200 
quickly they're still still wet though I

00:05:50.200 --> 00:05:54.430 
quickly they're still still wet though I
looked<00:05:51.200> at<00:05:51.440> the<00:05:52.810> looked<00:05:53.810> at<00:05:53.900> the<00:05:53.990> can<00:05:54.260> of

00:05:54.430 --> 00:05:54.440 
looked at the looked at the can of

00:05:54.440 --> 00:05:58.090 
looked at the looked at the can of
fiberglass<00:05:54.980> resin<00:05:55.250> here<00:05:56.140> and<00:05:57.140> it<00:05:57.680> tells<00:05:57.860> me

00:05:58.090 --> 00:05:58.100 
fiberglass resin here and it tells me

00:05:58.100 --> 00:06:01.060 
fiberglass resin here and it tells me
that<00:05:58.280> I<00:05:58.900> have<00:05:59.900> to<00:06:00.050> wait<00:06:00.290> an<00:06:00.470> hour<00:06:00.680> and<00:06:00.890> a<00:06:00.920> half

00:06:01.060 --> 00:06:01.070 
that I have to wait an hour and a half

00:06:01.070 --> 00:06:02.470 
that I have to wait an hour and a half
to<00:06:01.220> two<00:06:01.280> hours<00:06:01.370> for<00:06:01.730> this<00:06:01.790> to<00:06:02.030> fully<00:06:02.210> cure

00:06:02.470 --> 00:06:02.480 
to two hours for this to fully cure

00:06:02.480 --> 00:06:05.530 
to two hours for this to fully cure
before<00:06:02.720> I<00:06:02.960> can<00:06:03.550> go<00:06:04.550> any<00:06:04.730> further<00:06:04.910> it's<00:06:05.270> already

to this tomorrow tomorrow to be fully
cured<00:06:16.880> what<00:06:17.780> I<00:06:17.810> can<00:06:17.990> do<00:06:18.080> right<00:06:18.110> then<00:06:18.500> is<00:06:20.200> sand

00:06:21.190 --> 00:06:21.200 
cured what I can do right then is sand

00:06:21.200 --> 00:06:22.630 
cured what I can do right then is sand
it<00:06:21.350> down<00:06:21.380> a<00:06:21.530> bit<00:06:21.650> and<00:06:21.920> it<00:06:22.040> doesn't<00:06:22.280> have<00:06:22.430> to<00:06:22.610> be

00:06:22.630 --> 00:06:22.640 
it down a bit and it doesn't have to be

00:06:22.640 --> 00:06:26.860 
it down a bit and it doesn't have to be
that<00:06:23.210> she<00:06:24.200> doesn't<00:06:24.350> even<00:06:24.500> have<00:06:24.800> to<00:06:24.830> be<00:06:25.870> very

00:06:26.860 --> 00:06:26.870 
that she doesn't even have to be very

00:06:26.870 --> 00:06:28.630 
that she doesn't even have to be very
exact<00:06:27.500> because<00:06:27.740> I'm<00:06:27.950> going<00:06:28.040> to<00:06:28.130> be<00:06:28.190> bonding

00:06:28.630 --> 00:06:28.640 
exact because I'm going to be bonding

00:06:28.640 --> 00:06:32.950 
exact because I'm going to be bonding
over<00:06:28.760> this<00:06:29.030> so<00:06:29.890> and<00:06:30.890> they<00:06:31.490> can<00:06:31.640> also<00:06:31.790> seal<00:06:32.720> off

00:06:32.950 --> 00:06:32.960 
over this so and they can also seal off

00:06:32.960 --> 00:06:34.600 
over this so and they can also seal off
the<00:06:33.230> back<00:06:33.410> of<00:06:33.620> that<00:06:33.650> to<00:06:34.100> prevent<00:06:34.250> moisture

00:06:34.600 --> 00:06:34.610 
the back of that to prevent moisture

00:06:34.610 --> 00:06:38.260 
the back of that to prevent moisture
coming<00:06:35.060> through<00:06:35.390> and<00:06:36.820> spoiling<00:06:37.820> any<00:06:38.060> of<00:06:38.180> the

00:06:38.260 --> 00:06:38.270 
coming through and spoiling any of the

00:06:38.270 --> 00:06:41.800 
coming through and spoiling any of the
bond<00:06:38.450> to<00:06:38.540> work<00:06:38.720> on<00:06:38.870> the<00:06:38.960> side<00:06:39.700> so<00:06:40.700> tomorrow<00:06:41.570> I'm

00:06:41.800 --> 00:06:41.810 
bond to work on the side so tomorrow I'm

00:06:41.810 --> 00:06:44.170 
bond to work on the side so tomorrow I'm
going<00:06:41.930> to<00:06:42.020> be<00:06:42.370> working<00:06:43.370> on<00:06:43.580> smoothing<00:06:43.970> this

00:06:44.170 --> 00:06:44.180 
going to be working on smoothing this

00:06:44.180 --> 00:06:46.859 
going to be working on smoothing this
out<00:06:44.390> even<00:06:45.320> more

00:06:46.859 --> 00:06:46.869 
out even more

00:06:46.869 --> 00:06:50.350 
out even more
just<00:06:47.869> to<00:06:47.990> be<00:06:48.080> sure<00:06:48.110> what<00:06:48.770> I'm<00:06:48.889> probably<00:06:49.580> going

00:06:50.350 --> 00:06:50.360 
just to be sure what I'm probably going

00:06:50.360 --> 00:06:52.449 
just to be sure what I'm probably going
to<00:06:50.689> do<00:06:50.839> and<00:06:51.110> I'm<00:06:51.169> just<00:06:51.379> kind<00:06:51.619> of<00:06:51.770> thinking<00:06:52.339> out

00:06:52.449 --> 00:06:52.459 
to do and I'm just kind of thinking out

00:06:52.459 --> 00:06:58.029 
to do and I'm just kind of thinking out
loud<00:06:52.490> and<00:06:52.909> strategizing<00:06:53.479> here<00:06:53.899> is<00:06:56.979> once<00:06:57.979> again

00:06:58.029 --> 00:06:58.039 
loud and strategizing here is once again

00:06:58.039 --> 00:06:59.679 
loud and strategizing here is once again
after<00:06:58.279> tomorrow<00:06:58.669> I'm<00:06:58.789> probably<00:06:58.969> probably

00:06:59.679 --> 00:06:59.689 
after tomorrow I'm probably probably

00:06:59.689 --> 00:07:01.739 
after tomorrow I'm probably probably
going<00:07:00.020> to<00:07:00.080> spray<00:07:00.409> the<00:07:00.679> back<00:07:00.860> of<00:07:01.069> the<00:07:01.159> fender

00:07:01.739 --> 00:07:01.749 
going to spray the back of the fender

00:07:01.749 --> 00:07:05.379 
going to spray the back of the fender
with<00:07:02.749> a<00:07:02.779> couple<00:07:03.679> of<00:07:03.740> layers<00:07:03.949> of<00:07:04.459> the<00:07:04.699> truck<00:07:05.209> bed

00:07:05.379 --> 00:07:05.389 
with a couple of layers of the truck bed

00:07:05.389 --> 00:07:06.909 
with a couple of layers of the truck bed
coating<00:07:05.719> really<00:07:06.110> just<00:07:06.319> to<00:07:06.439> seal<00:07:06.709> in<00:07:06.889> the

00:07:06.909 --> 00:07:06.919 
coating really just to seal in the

00:07:06.919 --> 00:07:10.799 
coating really just to seal in the
repairs<00:07:07.399> that<00:07:08.029> I've<00:07:08.119> done<00:07:08.240> so<00:07:08.479> far<00:07:08.509> and<00:07:09.639> then

00:07:10.799 --> 00:07:10.809 
repairs that I've done so far and then

00:07:10.809 --> 00:07:14.980 
repairs that I've done so far and then
mount<00:07:11.809> the<00:07:11.929> fender<00:07:13.449> where<00:07:14.449> it's<00:07:14.569> supposed<00:07:14.689> to

00:07:14.980 --> 00:07:14.990 
mount the fender where it's supposed to

00:07:14.990 --> 00:07:23.499 
mount the fender where it's supposed to
be<00:07:15.199> in<00:07:15.379> which<00:07:15.589> case<00:07:18.039> should<00:07:19.039> probably<00:07:22.509> know

00:07:23.499 --> 00:07:23.509 
be in which case should probably know

00:07:23.509 --> 00:07:25.570 
be in which case should probably know
didn't<00:07:24.379> even<00:07:24.559> primer<00:07:24.800> that<00:07:24.919> last<00:07:25.279> week<00:07:25.459> I

00:07:25.570 --> 00:07:25.580 
didn't even primer that last week I

00:07:25.580 --> 00:07:27.609 
didn't even primer that last week I
should<00:07:25.729> primer<00:07:25.909> that<00:07:25.999> right<00:07:26.240> now<00:07:26.559> so<00:07:27.559> I<00:07:27.589> have

00:07:27.609 --> 00:07:27.619 
should primer that right now so I have
