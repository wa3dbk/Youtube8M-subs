00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:18.930 
and you know even if you think about it

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:21.170 
and you know even if you think about it
getting<00:02:19.409> dogs<00:02:19.680> for<00:02:20.099> 17<00:02:20.579> kills<00:02:20.819> in<00:02:20.939> a<00:02:20.999> row

that's<00:02:21.689> not<00:02:21.870> even<00:02:21.989> really

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:22.470 
that's not even really

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:23.810 
that's not even really

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:23.820 
worth it I mean the dogs might get you

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:25.940 
worth it I mean the dogs might get you
an<00:02:23.910> extra<00:02:24.300> seven<00:02:24.780> to<00:02:24.960> ten<00:02:25.200> kills<00:02:25.470> or<00:02:25.650> something

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:28.950 
like that is that really worth it no not

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:30.770 
like that is that really worth it no not
not<00:02:29.190> really<00:02:29.550> you<00:02:29.670> know<00:02:29.760> it's<00:02:30.120> not<00:02:30.330> it<00:02:30.570> wouldn't

not really you know it's not it wouldn't

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:32.960

those high kill streaks you've got to

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:39.350 
those high kill streaks you've got to
play<00:02:37.980> the<00:02:38.010> objective<00:02:38.520> it's<00:02:38.700> going<00:02:38.850> to<00:02:38.910> be<00:02:39.030> so

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:39.360 
play the objective it's going to be so

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:40.850 
play the objective it's going to be so
much<00:02:39.720> more<00:02:40.020> worth<00:02:40.290> it<00:02:40.440> it's<00:02:40.590> going<00:02:40.710> to<00:02:40.770> help

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:40.860 
much more worth it it's going to help

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:42.830 
much more worth it it's going to help
you<00:02:41.040> get<00:02:41.190> burn<00:02:41.310> them<00:02:41.460> so<00:02:41.640> much<00:02:41.820> easier<00:02:42.150> and<00:02:42.300> so

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:42.840 
you get burn them so much easier and so

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:45.320 
you get burn them so much easier and so
much<00:02:42.900> quicker<00:02:43.230> now<00:02:43.530> on<00:02:44.370> top<00:02:44.730> of<00:02:44.790> that<00:02:45.060> on<00:02:45.180> top

with that that can stack up very very

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:47.150 
with that that can stack up very very
quickly<00:03:45.780> and<00:03:46.050> then<00:03:46.380> finally<00:03:46.769> the<00:03:46.860> stealth

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:49.350 
chopper I like because it's one that you

00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:50.570 
chopper I like because it's one that you
don't<00:03:49.530> have<00:03:49.620> to<00:03:49.739> control<00:03:50.070> you<00:03:50.220> don't<00:03:50.370> have<00:03:50.459> to

lot of kills an enemy team usually won't

00:03:56.310 --> 00:03:57.710 
lot of kills an enemy team usually won't
take<00:03:56.459> it<00:03:56.489> out<00:03:56.670> so<00:03:56.850> usually<00:03:57.209> that<00:03:57.330> one<00:03:57.480> can<00:03:57.630> be

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:15.289 
death machine you have to use yourself
when<00:04:14.160> you<00:04:14.250> could<00:04:14.400> be<00:04:14.489> using<00:04:14.730> your<00:04:14.820> regular<00:04:14.970> gun

00:04:15.289 --> 00:04:15.299 
when you could be using your regular gun

00:04:15.299 --> 00:04:17.449 
when you could be using your regular gun
so<00:04:15.570> really<00:04:16.229> if<00:04:16.410> you're<00:04:16.560> going<00:04:16.590> for<00:04:17.070> those<00:04:17.220> high

00:04:17.449 --> 00:04:17.459 
so really if you're going for those high

00:04:17.459 --> 00:04:19.370 
so really if you're going for those high
kill<00:04:17.729> streaks<00:04:18.030> I<00:04:18.209> would<00:04:18.600> suggest<00:04:18.750> you<00:04:19.049> use<00:04:19.109> the

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:19.380 
kill streaks I would suggest you use the

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:21.800 
kill streaks I would suggest you use the
UAV<00:04:19.830> the<00:04:20.430> counter<00:04:20.790> UAV<00:04:20.970> the<00:04:21.299> Guardian<00:04:21.720> the

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:25.830 
mixture of those and then one of the

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:27.650 
mixture of those and then one of the
larger<00:04:26.160> kill<00:04:26.340> streaks<00:04:26.550> really<00:04:26.850> my<00:04:27.030> favorite
