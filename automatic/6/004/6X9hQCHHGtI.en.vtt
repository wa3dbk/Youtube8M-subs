Huddersfield today to talk to us about
quantum<00:00:04.770> biology<00:00:05.029> but<00:00:06.029> I'd<00:00:06.150> just<00:00:06.180> like<00:00:06.480> you<00:00:06.600> to

00:00:06.650 --> 00:00:06.660 
quantum biology but I'd just like you to

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:08.990 
quantum biology but I'd just like you to
look<00:00:06.870> at<00:00:07.020> life<00:00:07.200> as<00:00:07.500> a<00:00:07.529> physicist<00:00:08.189> for<00:00:08.490> a<00:00:08.519> moment

00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:09.000 
look at life as a physicist for a moment

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.240 
look at life as a physicist for a moment
and<00:00:09.570> in<00:00:09.719> particular<00:00:09.840> the<00:00:10.320> idea<00:00:10.349> that<00:00:10.889> thorium

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:11.250 
and in particular the idea that thorium

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:12.890 
and in particular the idea that thorium
should<00:00:11.759> be<00:00:11.849> considered<00:00:12.389> as<00:00:12.630> an<00:00:12.809> alternative

00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:12.900 
should be considered as an alternative

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:16.400 
should be considered as an alternative

having come here to talk about quantum
biology<00:00:22.769> I<00:00:23.100> should<00:00:23.490> confess<00:00:24.119> that<00:00:24.359> my<00:00:24.680> main

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:25.680 
biology I should confess that my main

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:28.009 
biology I should confess that my main
research<00:00:26.099> area<00:00:26.730> is<00:00:26.939> nuclear<00:00:27.390> physics<00:00:27.750> so<00:00:27.900> I'm

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:28.019 
research area is nuclear physics so I'm

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:29.240 
research area is nuclear physics so I'm
a<00:00:28.050> nuclear<00:00:28.470> physicist<00:00:28.830> but<00:00:29.039> an<00:00:29.099> academic

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:29.250 
a nuclear physicist but an academic

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:32.179 
a nuclear physicist but an academic
nuclear<00:00:29.939> physicist<00:00:30.390> so<00:00:30.960> I<00:00:30.990> understand<00:00:31.590> the

00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:32.189 
nuclear physicist so I understand the

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:36.700 
nuclear physicist so I understand the
science<00:00:32.700> that<00:00:33.000> goes<00:00:33.210> into<00:00:34.190> nuclear<00:00:35.190> power<00:00:35.460> and

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:36.710 
science that goes into nuclear power and

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:39.560 
science that goes into nuclear power and
thorium<00:00:37.710> as<00:00:38.190> a<00:00:38.250> fuel<00:00:38.730> I<00:00:38.969> think<00:00:39.420> is

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.570 
thorium as a fuel I think is

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:42.979 
thorium as a fuel I think is
tremendously<00:00:40.230> exciting<00:00:40.640> now<00:00:41.719> you<00:00:42.719> know<00:00:42.809> I'm

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:42.989 
tremendously exciting now you know I'm

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:45.560 
tremendously exciting now you know I'm
not<00:00:43.200> an<00:00:43.350> expert<00:00:43.440> in<00:00:43.980> nuclear<00:00:44.670> power<00:00:44.940> but<00:00:45.210> I<00:00:45.270> can

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570 
not an expert in nuclear power but I can

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:47.750 
not an expert in nuclear power but I can
see<00:00:45.780> the<00:00:45.930> advantages<00:00:46.500> that<00:00:46.739> thorium<00:00:46.980> has<00:00:47.190> over

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.760 
see the advantages that thorium has over

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:50.990 
see the advantages that thorium has over
uranium<00:00:47.989> it's<00:00:48.989> cheaper<00:00:49.680> it's<00:00:50.010> more<00:00:50.309> abundant

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
uranium it's cheaper it's more abundant

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.479 
uranium it's cheaper it's more abundant
the<00:00:51.690> technology<00:00:52.379> is<00:00:52.590> there<00:00:52.800> that's<00:00:53.070> what's<00:00:53.250> so

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:53.489 
the technology is there that's what's so

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:55.639 
the technology is there that's what's so
so<00:00:54.059> so<00:00:54.390> wonderful<00:00:54.899> the<00:00:55.050> technology's<00:00:55.530> been

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:55.649 
so so wonderful the technology's been

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:57.319 
so so wonderful the technology's been
around<00:00:55.980> ever<00:00:56.280> since<00:00:56.399> the<00:00:56.730> early<00:00:56.969> days<00:00:57.149> of

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
around ever since the early days of

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:01.029 
around ever since the early days of
nuclear<00:00:57.750> power<00:00:57.930> in<00:00:58.170> the<00:00:58.250> 1940s<00:00:59.250> and<00:00:59.840> yet

00:01:01.029 --> 00:01:01.039 
nuclear power in the 1940s and yet

00:01:01.039 --> 00:01:03.290 
nuclear power in the 1940s and yet
governments<00:01:02.039> particularly<00:01:02.550> in<00:01:02.820> the<00:01:02.969> u.s.

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 
governments particularly in the u.s.

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:07.039 
governments particularly in the u.s.
move<00:01:04.080> towards<00:01:04.650> uranium<00:01:05.250> mainly<00:01:06.180> driven<00:01:06.600> by

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049 
move towards uranium mainly driven by

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:10.719 
move towards uranium mainly driven by
the<00:01:07.680> need<00:01:07.920> for<00:01:08.060> plutonium<00:01:09.060> for<00:01:09.689> the<00:01:09.810> arms<00:01:10.110> race

00:01:10.719 --> 00:01:10.729 
the need for plutonium for the arms race

00:01:10.729 --> 00:01:14.060 
the need for plutonium for the arms race
thorium<00:01:11.780> isn't<00:01:12.780> dirty<00:01:12.990> like<00:01:13.470> uranium<00:01:13.799> it

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 
thorium isn't dirty like uranium it

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:16.390 
thorium isn't dirty like uranium it
doesn't<00:01:14.460> produce<00:01:14.700> weapons-grade<00:01:15.630> plutonium

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:16.400 
doesn't produce weapons-grade plutonium

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:19.490 
doesn't produce weapons-grade plutonium
so<00:01:17.400> it<00:01:17.850> really<00:01:18.360> answers<00:01:18.600> many<00:01:19.229> of<00:01:19.380> the

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500 
so it really answers many of the

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:22.070 
so it really answers many of the
questions<00:01:19.710> of<00:01:20.130> concerns<00:01:20.729> that<00:01:21.509> the<00:01:21.659> public

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080 
questions of concerns that the public

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:24.469 
questions of concerns that the public
have<00:01:22.380> about<00:01:22.799> nuclear<00:01:23.220> power<00:01:23.460> so<00:01:24.090> I<00:01:24.119> would

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
have about nuclear power so I would

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:27.980 
have about nuclear power so I would
really<00:01:24.840> be<00:01:25.049> very<00:01:25.200> much<00:01:25.680> in<00:01:25.830> favor<00:01:26.330> in<00:01:27.330> pushing

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990 
really be very much in favor in pushing

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:30.350 
really be very much in favor in pushing
that<00:01:28.500> the<00:01:28.740> idea<00:01:29.009> that<00:01:29.159> thorium<00:01:29.520> should

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360 
that the idea that thorium should

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:32.600 
that the idea that thorium should
replace<00:01:30.750> uranium<00:01:31.350> in<00:01:31.530> future<00:01:32.040> nuclear<00:01:32.220> power

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
replace uranium in future nuclear power

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:35.620 
replace uranium in future nuclear power
reactors<00:01:33.180> would<00:01:33.990> that<00:01:34.200> be<00:01:34.439> a<00:01:34.680> huge

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:35.630 
reactors would that be a huge

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:39.200 
reactors would that be a huge
undertaking<00:01:36.630> to<00:01:37.560> change<00:01:38.040> the<00:01:38.280> one<00:01:38.490> to<00:01:39.060> the

reactors even some countries in the

00:01:57.689 --> 00:01:59.929 
reactors even some countries in the
Middle<00:01:57.899> East<00:01:58.049> that<00:01:58.200> have<00:01:58.799> a<00:01:58.829> lot<00:01:59.159> of<00:01:59.189> oil<00:01:59.430> are

00:01:59.929 --> 00:01:59.939 
Middle East that have a lot of oil are

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:03.350 
Middle East that have a lot of oil are
thinking<00:02:00.780> far<00:02:01.680> enough<00:02:01.860> ahead<00:02:02.130> that<00:02:02.460> they<00:02:03.180> may

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:03.360 
thinking far enough ahead that they may

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:05.420 
thinking far enough ahead that they may
want<00:02:03.600> to<00:02:03.659> move<00:02:03.930> towards<00:02:04.439> thorium<00:02:04.860> so<00:02:05.250> I<00:02:05.280> think

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:05.430 
want to move towards thorium so I think

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:09.440 
want to move towards thorium so I think
it's<00:02:05.820> not<00:02:06.180> a<00:02:06.560> mere<00:02:07.560> academics<00:02:08.250> dream<00:02:08.789> this<00:02:09.209> is

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:09.450 
it's not a mere academics dream this is

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:12.390 
it's not a mere academics dream this is
really<00:02:09.869> something<00:02:10.289> taken<00:02:10.830> seriously<00:02:11.280> by<00:02:11.580> many

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:12.400 
really something taken seriously by many

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:14.520 
really something taken seriously by many
country's<00:02:12.730> and<00:02:12.970> I<00:02:13.540> think<00:02:13.780> as<00:02:13.900> far<00:02:13.930> as<00:02:14.079> the<00:02:14.140> UK

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:14.530 
country's and I think as far as the UK

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:16.229 
country's and I think as far as the UK
is<00:02:14.590> concerned<00:02:14.709> what<00:02:15.340> it<00:02:15.459> would<00:02:15.700> address<00:02:15.939> is

00:02:16.229 --> 00:02:16.239 
is concerned what it would address is

00:02:16.239 --> 00:02:19.080 
is concerned what it would address is
this<00:02:16.390> public<00:02:16.750> worry<00:02:17.470> because<00:02:18.430> thorium<00:02:18.700> also

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:19.090 
this public worry because thorium also

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:21.350 
this public worry because thorium also
doesn't<00:02:19.420> produce<00:02:19.569> as<00:02:19.870> much<00:02:20.019> nuclear<00:02:20.439> waste<00:02:20.769> as

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:21.360 
doesn't produce as much nuclear waste as

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:24.600 
doesn't produce as much nuclear waste as
uranium<00:02:22.360> and<00:02:22.599> that's<00:02:23.110> usually<00:02:23.680> what<00:02:24.400> really

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:24.610 
uranium and that's usually what really

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:26.130 
uranium and that's usually what really
concerns<00:02:24.909> people<00:02:25.569> you<00:02:25.750> know<00:02:25.870> it's<00:02:25.989> all<00:02:26.049> very

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:26.140 
concerns people you know it's all very

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:28.170 
concerns people you know it's all very
well<00:02:26.409> building<00:02:26.920> nuclear<00:02:27.189> power<00:02:27.310> reactors<00:02:27.970> but

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:28.180 
well building nuclear power reactors but

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:31.140 
well building nuclear power reactors but
what<00:02:28.360> do<00:02:28.599> you<00:02:28.689> do<00:02:28.870> with<00:02:29.079> the<00:02:29.200> waste<00:02:29.349> I<00:02:29.769> think<00:02:30.430> it

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:31.150 
what do you do with the waste I think it

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:34.280 
what do you do with the waste I think it
thorium<00:02:31.840> would<00:02:31.959> go<00:02:32.170> a<00:02:32.439> long<00:02:32.769> way<00:02:33.040> in<00:02:33.310> terms<00:02:33.340> of

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:34.290 
thorium would go a long way in terms of

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:37.349 
thorium would go a long way in terms of
helping<00:02:35.290> public<00:02:36.010> acceptability<00:02:36.519> of<00:02:37.000> nuclear

00:02:37.349 --> 00:02:37.359 
helping public acceptability of nuclear

00:02:37.359 --> 00:02:39.750 
helping public acceptability of nuclear
power<00:02:37.540> so<00:02:37.840> I<00:02:37.870> don't<00:02:38.230> think<00:02:38.409> it's<00:02:38.709> really<00:02:39.129> such

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:39.760 
power so I don't think it's really such

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:43.679 
power so I don't think it's really such
