alright today I'm gonna talk about a

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:11.480 
alright today I'm gonna talk about a
program<00:00:07.049> that<00:00:07.639> will<00:00:08.639> greatly<00:00:09.599> increase<00:00:10.490> or

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:11.490 
program that will greatly increase or

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:15.770 
program that will greatly increase or
increase<00:00:12.420> the<00:00:12.809> the<00:00:14.240> speed<00:00:15.240> of<00:00:15.420> your<00:00:15.570> computer

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:15.780 
increase the the speed of your computer

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:20.810 
increase the the speed of your computer
and<00:00:16.410> it'll<00:00:16.890> free<00:00:17.310> up<00:00:17.340> a<00:00:17.970> lot<00:00:18.750> of<00:00:18.779> RAM<00:00:19.230> and<00:00:19.820> that

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:20.820 
and it'll free up a lot of RAM and that

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:25.580 
and it'll free up a lot of RAM and that
is<00:00:21.060> RAM<00:00:21.510> booster<00:00:22.970> which<00:00:23.970> is<00:00:25.019> that's<00:00:25.439> not

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:25.590 
is RAM booster which is that's not

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:26.240 
is RAM booster which is that's not
it

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:26.250 
it

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:32.479 
it
this<00:00:27.150> is<00:00:27.420> it<00:00:30.109> yeah<00:00:31.109> this<00:00:31.500> is<00:00:31.679> it<00:00:31.859> right<00:00:32.040> here

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:32.489 
this is it yeah this is it right here

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:35.840 
this is it yeah this is it right here
alright<00:00:33.090> it's<00:00:33.390> an<00:00:33.630> extremely<00:00:34.440> small<00:00:35.130> program

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:35.850 
alright it's an extremely small program

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:40.880 
alright it's an extremely small program
file<00:00:37.340> it<00:00:38.340> all<00:00:39.120> it<00:00:39.420> does<00:00:39.629> is<00:00:39.840> free<00:00:40.140> up<00:00:40.290> Ram<00:00:40.620> its

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890 
file it all it does is free up Ram its

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:44.750 
file it all it does is free up Ram its
Ram<00:00:41.190> booster<00:00:41.930> you<00:00:42.930> can<00:00:42.960> get<00:00:43.379> it<00:00:43.530> at<00:00:43.710> a<00:00:43.739> lot<00:00:44.610> of

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
Ram booster you can get it at a lot of

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:47.200 
Ram booster you can get it at a lot of
different<00:00:45.090> websites<00:00:45.210> I<00:00:45.899> got<00:00:46.140> it<00:00:46.289> from

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:47.210 
different websites I got it from

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:51.529 
different websites I got it from
download<00:00:48.210> comm<00:00:49.610> just<00:00:50.610> go<00:00:50.789> there<00:00:51.059> and<00:00:51.090> search

00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539 
download comm just go there and search

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:53.869 
download comm just go there and search
around<00:00:51.840> booster<00:00:52.620> and<00:00:52.890> I'm<00:00:52.980> pretty<00:00:53.370> sure<00:00:53.489> it

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879 
around booster and I'm pretty sure it

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:56.569 
around booster and I'm pretty sure it
would<00:00:54.030> be<00:00:54.210> one<00:00:55.050> of<00:00:55.170> the<00:00:55.260> first<00:00:55.530> ones<00:00:55.829> to<00:00:55.980> pop<00:00:56.309> up

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579 
would be one of the first ones to pop up

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:00.950 
would be one of the first ones to pop up
well<00:00:57.180> here's<00:00:57.780> the<00:00:58.079> deal<00:00:58.640> if<00:00:59.640> you<00:01:00.000> have<00:01:00.030> three

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 
well here's the deal if you have three

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:04.939 
well here's the deal if you have three
gigs<00:01:01.590> of<00:01:01.829> ram<00:01:02.100> or<00:01:02.579> more<00:01:03.210> like<00:01:03.809> i<00:01:04.019> do<00:01:04.080> i'd

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949 
gigs of ram or more like i do i'd

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:09.350 
gigs of ram or more like i do i'd
recommend<00:01:05.790> setting<00:01:06.299> it<00:01:06.689> on<00:01:07.640> 800<00:01:08.640> anywhere

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
recommend setting it on 800 anywhere

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:14.270 
recommend setting it on 800 anywhere
from<00:01:09.570> 800<00:01:10.320> to<00:01:10.490> 1500<00:01:11.840> that's<00:01:12.840> a<00:01:13.080> good<00:01:13.830> amount<00:01:14.159> of

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
from 800 to 1500 that's a good amount of

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:20.960 
from 800 to 1500 that's a good amount of
ram<00:01:14.580> to<00:01:14.880> free<00:01:15.150> up<00:01:17.390> any<00:01:18.390> lower<00:01:18.900> I'd<00:01:19.770> say<00:01:20.460> if<00:01:20.790> you

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:20.970 
ram to free up any lower I'd say if you

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:23.990 
ram to free up any lower I'd say if you
only<00:01:21.090> had<00:01:21.420> you<00:01:21.840> know<00:01:21.960> one<00:01:22.290> or<00:01:22.439> two<00:01:22.470> gigs<00:01:23.040> ram<00:01:23.549> I

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000 
only had you know one or two gigs ram I

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.929 
only had you know one or two gigs ram I
would<00:01:24.630> put<00:01:24.869> it<00:01:24.960> on<00:01:25.170> probably<00:01:25.920> anywhere<00:01:26.670> from

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:26.939 
would put it on probably anywhere from

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:32.149 
would put it on probably anywhere from
300<00:01:27.780> to<00:01:27.900> 500<00:01:29.840> other<00:01:30.840> than<00:01:31.200> that<00:01:31.530> yeah<00:01:31.950> that's

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159 
300 to 500 other than that yeah that's

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:40.210 
300 to 500 other than that yeah that's
that's<00:01:32.640> pretty<00:01:32.939> much<00:01:33.180> it<00:01:33.509> I<00:01:33.799> keep<00:01:34.799> mine<00:01:35.130> on<00:01:35.360> 805

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:40.220 

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:41.800 

damn<00:01:41.220> it

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:41.810 
damn it

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:45.850 
damn it
alright<00:01:42.810> 816<00:01:43.740> whatever<00:01:44.220> you<00:01:44.759> hit<00:01:44.909> optimize

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:45.860 
alright 816 whatever you hit optimize

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:49.520 
alright 816 whatever you hit optimize
and<00:01:46.860> it's<00:01:47.100> gonna<00:01:47.540> free<00:01:48.540> it<00:01:48.689> up<00:01:48.840> there<00:01:49.229> you<00:01:49.470> go

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:49.530 
and it's gonna free it up there you go

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:55.130 
and it's gonna free it up there you go
it<00:01:49.860> just<00:01:49.890> freed<00:01:50.399> up<00:01:50.450> that<00:01:51.450> much<00:01:51.869> of<00:01:52.939> memory<00:01:54.140> so

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:55.140 
it just freed up that much of memory so

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:58.399 
it just freed up that much of memory so
as<00:01:55.740> you<00:01:55.920> can<00:01:56.009> see<00:01:56.250> on<00:01:56.399> my<00:01:56.430> Ram<00:01:56.850> meter<00:01:57.210> over<00:01:57.630> here

00:01:58.399 --> 00:01:58.409 
as you can see on my Ram meter over here

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:01.130 
as you can see on my Ram meter over here
it<00:01:58.619> just<00:01:59.130> went<00:01:59.340> down<00:01:59.479> it<00:02:00.479> was<00:02:00.570> probably

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:01.140 
it just went down it was probably

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:03.289 
it just went down it was probably
somewhere<00:02:01.710> in<00:02:01.770> the<00:02:01.860> 50s<00:02:02.399> and<00:02:02.700> now<00:02:02.790> us<00:02:02.969> went

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:03.299 
somewhere in the 50s and now us went

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:07.040 
somewhere in the 50s and now us went
down<00:02:03.450> to<00:02:03.659> 42%<00:02:04.590> since<00:02:04.860> I've<00:02:05.210> optimized<00:02:06.210> and

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:07.050 
down to 42% since I've optimized and

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:10.400 
down to 42% since I've optimized and
use<00:02:07.200> the<00:02:07.500> RAM<00:02:07.680> booster<00:02:08.390> but<00:02:09.390> yeah<00:02:10.080> that's

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:10.410 
use the RAM booster but yeah that's

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:11.810 
use the RAM booster but yeah that's
pretty<00:02:10.740> much<00:02:11.100> it

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:11.820 
pretty much it

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:15.290 
pretty much it
it's<00:02:12.180> a<00:02:12.600> extremely<00:02:13.590> small<00:02:14.010> program<00:02:14.550> file<00:02:14.850> so

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:15.300 
it's a extremely small program file so

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:18.610 
it's a extremely small program file so
it<00:02:15.420> won't<00:02:15.600> use<00:02:15.900> up<00:02:15.930> a<00:02:16.230> lot<00:02:16.410> of<00:02:16.530> disk<00:02:16.800> space<00:02:16.980> and

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:18.620 
it won't use up a lot of disk space and

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:23.020 
it won't use up a lot of disk space and
yeah<00:02:19.620> that's<00:02:20.010> that<00:02:20.480> if<00:02:21.480> you<00:02:21.630> like<00:02:21.870> my<00:02:22.080> video

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:23.030 
yeah that's that if you like my video

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:28.100
