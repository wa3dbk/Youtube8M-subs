00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:24.860 
because it gets pretty hard to rotate

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:26.380 
because it gets pretty hard to rotate
the<00:02:25.010> new<00:02:25.160> stuff<00:02:25.459> to<00:02:25.640> the<00:02:25.760> back<00:02:25.970> we<00:02:26.209> have<00:02:26.239> to

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:26.390 
the new stuff to the back we have to

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:28.509

pull<00:02:26.750> it<00:02:26.780> all<00:02:27.049> out<00:02:27.080> you<00:02:27.890> can<00:02:28.069> see<00:02:28.220> there's<00:02:28.400> an

00:02:28.509 --> 00:02:28.519 
pull it all out you can see there's an

00:02:28.519 --> 00:02:30.039 
pull it all out you can see there's an
