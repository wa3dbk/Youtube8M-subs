prefer to get them done so lately I've
just<00:02:05.950> decided<00:02:06.280> that<00:02:06.579> it's<00:02:06.729> worth<00:02:06.970> it<00:02:07.180> for<00:02:07.450> me

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:07.479 
just decided that it's worth it for me

00:02:07.479 --> 00:02:10.649 
just decided that it's worth it for me
to<00:02:07.689> instead<00:02:08.619> of<00:02:08.879> continue<00:02:09.879> to<00:02:09.999> buy<00:02:10.179> all<00:02:10.479> these

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:10.659 
to instead of continue to buy all these

00:02:10.659 --> 00:02:13.140 
to instead of continue to buy all these
nail<00:02:10.899> polishes<00:02:11.409> I<00:02:11.620> have<00:02:12.400> told<00:02:12.579> myself<00:02:12.790> that<00:02:13.090> i

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:13.150

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:16.960 
up and I'll just go to manicure a week
so<00:02:15.860> that's<00:02:16.040> kind<00:02:16.250> of<00:02:16.280> what<00:02:16.430> I've<00:02:16.550> been<00:02:16.790> doing

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:16.970 
so that's kind of what I've been doing

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:19.690 
so that's kind of what I've been doing
and<00:02:17.270> i<00:02:17.300> also<00:02:17.480> have<00:02:17.780> really<00:02:18.200> like<00:02:18.470> dry<00:02:19.250> cuticles

nine French manicure I do think that
French<00:04:02.930> manicures<00:04:03.470> chip<00:04:04.250> a<00:04:04.400> little<00:04:04.670> bit

00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:04.820 
French manicures chip a little bit

00:04:04.820 --> 00:04:06.820 
French manicures chip a little bit
easier<00:04:05.000> so<00:04:05.570> I<00:04:05.600> don't<00:04:05.959> typically<00:04:06.320> get<00:04:06.590> them

00:04:06.820 --> 00:04:06.830

00:04:08.979 --> 00:04:08.989 
also because my nails are really short

00:04:08.989 --> 00:04:10.960
