00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:08.389
 Now let's talk about the boardwalk cistern. 

00:00:08.389 --> 00:00:11.889
 this is a construction that has the purpose of storing water for 

00:00:11.889 --> 00:00:15.230
 food production and small animal husbandry 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:21.330
 interconnected to the boardwalk that will capture the rainwater has 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:24.330
 store up to 52 thousand liters of water 

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:30.199
 The first step in building is the identification of the site, which should 

00:00:30.199 --> 00:00:33.839
 be in the backyard area to facilitate family work 

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:38.080
 then the excavation of the cistern begins 

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:41.190
 she should be one meter and 80 centimeters deep 

00:00:42.129 --> 00:00:44.350
 in seven meters of diameter 

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:47.069
 in it will be worked the bottom 

00:00:47.069 --> 00:00:51.569
 the walls painted ceiling to the excavation can be made with machines 

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:57.030
 but in the final meter the activity must be manual so as not to exceed the 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:58.660
 depth of each 

00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:00.980
 and avoid drowning in the bottom 

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:04.420
 which is structured with the subfloor with an iron grid 

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:08.170
 while reinforced to finalize 

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:13.650
 the next step is to lift the wall one of the most common forms of wall is 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:19.860
 with three lines of the board in the size of 60 by 50 centimeters these plates are 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:23.020
 made of sand and cement by mason 

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:28.190
 plates should be mounted on top of a tarp to prevent 

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:31.090
 system cost is good to get desperate 

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:33.549
 the button team on the bottom of the board 

00:01:33.549 --> 00:01:38.249
 I repeat is that part of the drug the carioca score regardless if you lose weight 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:41.850
 today from 7am of brazilian month placing 

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:51.140
 within the wall of CearÃ¡ for coverage 

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:55.079
 this step requires rafters made of concrete and iron 

00:01:56.010 --> 00:01:59.130
 they will give support to the ceiling plates 

00:01:59.130 --> 00:01:59.960
 after 

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:03.330
 every tank has towed down with white trousers 

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:06.630
 for the construction of the boardwalk 

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:09.509
 the land must be with 10 million added 

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:14.759
 if it is full it must be excavated to reach the slope of the roads 

00:02:14.759 --> 00:02:20.059
 should not be done so far as this causes possible cracks 

00:02:20.059 --> 00:02:21.869
 for this reason 

00:02:21.869 --> 00:02:25.009
 the request must be made in full not only on the day 

00:02:25.599 --> 00:02:28.920
 the whole area will be evaluated by a small masonry wall 

00:02:30.429 --> 00:02:35.219
 this should be done with concrete divided into parts if up to three meters 

00:02:35.219 --> 00:02:39.099
 squares this is at least 4 to 5 centimeters 

00:02:39.919 --> 00:02:43.529
 between the parties to make changes in pressure 

00:02:43.529 --> 00:02:45.599
 which can be silicone 

00:02:45.599 --> 00:02:48.089
 valencia - with other material 

00:02:48.089 --> 00:02:51.699
 the important thing is that they always have the same thickness of the plates 

00:02:52.539 --> 00:02:54.529
 still according to the teacher 

00:02:54.529 --> 00:02:58.549
 these care needs to be taken into account at the time of construction 

00:02:59.149 --> 00:03:00.799
 the others are 

00:03:00.799 --> 00:03:04.979
 placed also wavy and everything else in it are all external 

00:03:04.979 --> 00:03:05.950
 in the first 

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:07.050
 is covered 

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:10.550
 It's covered today. It was raining here. 

00:03:12.879 --> 00:03:14.090
 in that session 

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:17.090
 the team was opened the ambassador made magic 

00:03:18.869 --> 00:03:21.089
 it is important that she 

00:03:21.089 --> 00:03:23.819
 the current 

00:03:23.819 --> 00:03:26.729
 disposed be divisible weak drink 

00:03:26.729 --> 00:03:29.679
 in the concrete machined from above what 

00:03:29.679 --> 00:03:32.699
 that's allowed as I'm in the good phase 

00:03:32.699 --> 00:03:37.609
 enough water just to be able to mix without tiring much more 

00:03:37.609 --> 00:03:38.689
 in the north water 

00:03:38.689 --> 00:03:41.689
 otherwise it will weaken this will stay 

00:03:43.519 --> 00:03:46.519
 if other team cement case 

00:03:48.329 --> 00:03:51.310
 to carry water from the boardwalk into the cistern 

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:55.839
 a small tank known as decanted 

00:03:55.839 --> 00:03:57.949
 composed of two pipes 

00:03:57.949 --> 00:04:02.129
 one hundred millimeters with a sieve at one end to avoid 

00:04:02.129 --> 00:04:05.079
 of dirt into the tank 

00:04:05.079 --> 00:04:08.359
 and another of an inch that works like bleeding 

00:04:09.159 --> 00:04:14.609
 some care is needed the boardwalk should receive a fence to 

00:04:14.609 --> 00:04:17.129
 prevent the entry of people and animals 

00:04:17.129 --> 00:04:21.400
 the residents must take into account the fact that they make repairs whenever 

00:04:21.399 --> 00:04:22.029
 need
