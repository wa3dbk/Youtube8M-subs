00:00:00.199 --> 00:00:03.360
 hello to all I find you 

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:05.580
 today to make you a little 

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:06.750
 presentation of basic material that he 

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:08.400
 will you need if you are a 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:11.519
 beginner therefore arises there with I read 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:13.769
 and in Greece is a presentation of 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:14.910
 material without superfluous material that will 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:17.940
 you be essential to be able to 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:19.080
 make a complete break so that's 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:22.590
 I will introduce you 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:24.449
 healthy products not hand so for 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:26.010
 work on the cuticles it's fine 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:27.750
 to use the words having that one 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:29.340
 applies on the hull criticism that one 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:30.869
 lets act equivalent to soften 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:33.210
 this way it's going to be easier 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:37.040
 with the spatula after being able to 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:37.040
 pushed back and pop and if necessary 

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:44.989
 we will need to work our 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:48.030
 hull reviews of a metal spatula 

00:00:44.989 --> 00:00:49.200
 so there are several but I 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:53.370
 find that this one is really very 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:57.220
 well then to be able to cut them on 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:59.450
 will need a small clip 

00:00:57.220 --> 00:01:00.950
 so there are several but it's 

00:00:59.450 --> 00:01:02.540
 the same I prefer this one because she 

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:04.970
 costs very well this way there is no 

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:07.070
 need to force and we strongly avoid 

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:09.500
 cuts to be able to stick our 

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:14.870
 capsules need a small bottle of 

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:17.660
 glue we are going to need as much dantin 

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:19.670
 diotime tool that will serve us to do 

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:24.410
 our french is affixed logic of 

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:27.370
 building a dust brush that 

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:27.370
 is very very useful 

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:38.280
 we are going to need a brush so a 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:43.260
 square flat brush preferably 1 4 or 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:48.150
 1 6 a nail file so it is fine 

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:50.490
 to have a squeaky and a grain 180 on 

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:52.290
 will need a bottle of acetone 

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:54.210
 so for beginners it is very 

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:56.250
 important to have one to be able to 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:58.230
 take off the capsules that were wrong 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:58.830
 stuck so in fact it does not take off those 

00:01:58.230 --> 00:02:01.020
 melt 

00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:03.030
 we cut the capsule we put to soak the 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:05.250
 capsule will disappear by itself we go 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:10.290
 need a bottle of cleaner so 

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:12.450
 this to degrease nojel we will have 

00:02:10.290 --> 00:02:16.100
 need a small cuticle oil 

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:16.100
 so very good for hydration 

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:31.450
 we are going to need a guillotine of a 

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:35.230
 cost of captious we will need 

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:35.230
 a box of capsules 

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:47.270
 then we will need a gel of 

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:51.870
 base that serves as a fixer then a gel 

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:56.070
 french for your free edge a gel of 

00:02:51.870 --> 00:03:02.160
 finish for shine is a germ 

00:02:56.070 --> 00:03:03.560
 of construction for modeling we are going 

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:06.570
 need a UV lamp 

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:08.580
 so it's nice to have one with 

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:10.760
 timer and that she does at least 36 

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:10.760
 watt 

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:18.000
 we are going to need them chablon 

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:19.920
 for those who want to do 

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:23.880
 lengthening angel high and not in 

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:28.460
 capsules and finally we're going to have 

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:28.460
 need cellulose square 

00:03:31.349 --> 00:03:35.650
 so that's the presentation is over 

00:03:34.329 --> 00:03:36.909
 so you can see that it takes 

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:39.010
 really not much when you're 

00:03:36.909 --> 00:03:40.540
 starting your eric to buy too much 

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:42.999
 superfluous things we may be 

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:44.889
 not use now so I hope 

00:03:42.999 --> 00:03:46.150
