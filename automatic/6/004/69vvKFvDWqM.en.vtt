it's a piece of aluminum that is shaped

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:34.180 
it's a piece of aluminum that is shaped
to<00:00:30.270> go<00:00:30.539> in<00:00:30.779> front<00:00:31.170> of<00:00:31.439> your<00:00:31.619> radiation

it is an incredibly valuable piece of

00:00:36.829 --> 00:00:40.000 
it is an incredibly valuable piece of
equipment<00:00:37.039> because<00:00:37.969> it<00:00:38.269> starts<00:00:38.629> rocks<00:00:38.960> chips

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:40.010

radiator and potentially puncturing it
so<00:00:45.440> for<00:00:45.620> a<00:00:45.649> very<00:00:45.829> small<00:00:46.519> investment<00:00:46.879> you<00:00:47.420> can

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:47.570 
so for a very small investment you can

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:49.420 
so for a very small investment you can
have<00:00:47.750> something<00:00:47.989> that<00:00:48.230> is<00:00:48.260> a<00:00:48.379> huge<00:00:48.469> safeguard

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:49.430 
have something that is a huge safeguard

have something that is a huge safeguard
in<00:00:50.239> this<00:00:50.420> case<00:00:50.629> we<00:00:50.809> have<00:00:50.960> a<00:00:50.989> cox<00:00:51.290> radiator

00:00:51.759 --> 00:00:51.769 
in this case we have a cox radiator

00:00:51.769 --> 00:00:53.530 
in this case we have a cox radiator
guard<00:00:52.129> that<00:00:52.699> we're<00:00:52.790> going<00:00:52.879> to<00:00:52.940> fit<00:00:53.180> to<00:00:53.360> our

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:53.540 
guard that we're going to fit to our

guard that we're going to fit to our
2009<00:00:54.170> r6<00:00:55.100> so<00:00:55.940> let's<00:00:56.120> get<00:00:56.239> started<00:00:56.629> now<00:00:57.350> as

00:00:57.520 --> 00:00:57.530 
2009 r6 so let's get started now as

00:00:57.530 --> 00:00:59.229 
2009 r6 so let's get started now as
always<00:00:57.860> with<00:00:58.219> every<00:00:58.430> product<00:00:58.670> you<00:00:58.820> get<00:00:59.059> you

always with every product you get you
get<00:00:59.360> some<00:00:59.570> instructions<00:01:00.110> these<00:01:00.320> are<00:01:00.500> quite

00:01:00.639 --> 00:01:00.649 
get some instructions these are quite

00:01:00.649 --> 00:01:03.039 
get some instructions these are quite
comprehensive<00:01:01.299> so<00:01:02.299> what<00:01:02.449> we've<00:01:02.570> got<00:01:02.690> to<00:01:02.780> do<00:01:02.899> is
