00:02:16.269 --> 00:02:18.449 
stress programs and all these different
things<00:02:16.569> because<00:02:16.690> I<00:02:16.840> thought<00:02:16.989> my<00:02:17.200> acne<00:02:18.010> was<00:02:18.040> due

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:20.170 
to stress and I think it's actually what

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:21.990 
to stress and I think it's actually what
it<00:02:20.260> was<00:02:20.410> because<00:02:20.739> I<00:02:20.860> guess<00:02:21.040> like<00:02:21.250> if<00:02:21.430> your<00:02:21.550> acne

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:22.000 
it was because I guess like if your acne

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:23.670 
it was because I guess like if your acne
it's<00:02:22.150> like<00:02:22.239> a<00:02:22.269> topical<00:02:22.810> acne<00:02:23.080> like<00:02:23.440> you<00:02:23.530> can

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:23.680 
it's like a topical acne like you can

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:26.699 
it's like a topical acne like you can
treat<00:02:23.920> it<00:02:23.950> with<00:02:24.160> like<00:02:24.310> topical<00:02:25.060> stuff<00:02:25.330> so<00:02:25.840> my

00:02:26.699 --> 00:02:26.709 
treat it with like topical stuff so my

00:02:26.709 --> 00:02:28.710 
treat it with like topical stuff so my
wouldn't<00:02:27.040> go<00:02:27.130> away<00:02:27.310> though<00:02:27.489> so<00:02:27.819> basically

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:28.720 
wouldn't go away though so basically

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:30.479 
wouldn't go away though so basically
what<00:02:29.049> I<00:02:29.080> did<00:02:29.200> was<00:02:29.410> I<00:02:29.950> went<00:02:30.310> to<00:02:30.400> the

00:03:08.009 --> 00:03:08.019 
being able to it's a little bit harder

00:03:08.019 --> 00:03:09.360 
being able to it's a little bit harder
for<00:03:08.049> girls<00:03:08.320> just<00:03:08.709> because<00:03:08.920> you<00:03:09.010> have<00:03:09.130> to<00:03:09.220> take

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:09.370 
for girls just because you have to take

stuff there's all these weird nasty

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:14.430 
stuff there's all these weird nasty
gross<00:03:13.359> side<00:03:13.660> effects<00:03:13.989> that<00:03:14.170> you<00:03:14.230> guys<00:03:14.380> should

occu<00:04:32.940> team<00:04:33.120> did<00:04:33.300> was<00:04:33.449> it<00:04:33.600> actually<00:04:33.690> like<00:04:34.050> I

00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:34.080 
occu team did was it actually like I

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:36.020 
occu team did was it actually like I
think<00:04:34.380> destroyed<00:04:34.800> my<00:04:34.979> oil<00:04:35.250> glands<00:04:35.490> so<00:04:35.729> I<00:04:35.760> can't

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:36.030 
think destroyed my oil glands so I can't

00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:37.460 
think destroyed my oil glands so I can't
even<00:04:36.210> produce<00:04:36.389> oil<00:04:36.780> anymore<00:04:37.080> which<00:04:37.229> is<00:04:37.380> I

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:37.470 
even produce oil anymore which is I

00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:40.939 
even produce oil anymore which is I
think<00:04:37.740> the<00:04:37.979> reason<00:04:38.250> why<00:04:38.370> I<00:04:38.699> cannot<00:04:39.389> like<00:04:40.380> make

00:04:40.939 --> 00:04:40.949 
think the reason why I cannot like make

00:04:40.949 --> 00:04:43.790 
think the reason why I cannot like make
pimples<00:04:41.370> but<00:04:41.910> basically<00:04:42.479> the<00:04:43.050> cells<00:04:43.289> so<00:04:43.500> fast

00:04:43.790 --> 00:04:43.800 
pimples but basically the cells so fast

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:45.800 
pimples but basically the cells so fast
the<00:04:43.949> cleaners<00:04:44.310> actually<00:04:44.669> draw<00:04:45.150> your<00:04:45.419> face<00:04:45.600> in

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:45.810 
the cleaners actually draw your face in

00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:47.840 
the cleaners actually draw your face in
your<00:04:45.900> face<00:04:45.960> tries<00:04:46.560> to<00:04:46.740> create<00:04:47.130> more<00:04:47.310> oil<00:04:47.580> which

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:47.850 
your face tries to create more oil which

00:04:47.850 --> 00:04:49.879 
your face tries to create more oil which
in<00:04:47.970> return<00:04:48.120> creates<00:04:48.630> more<00:04:48.780> acne<00:04:48.990> so<00:04:49.410> those

00:04:49.879 --> 00:04:49.889 
in return creates more acne so those

00:04:49.889 --> 00:04:51.529 
in return creates more acne so those
cleaners<00:04:50.160> don't<00:04:50.400> really<00:04:50.699> work<00:04:50.910> very<00:04:50.940> well<00:04:51.240> I

00:06:02.330 --> 00:06:02.340 
like a ton of different products that I

00:06:02.340 --> 00:06:04.460 
like a ton of different products that I
use<00:06:02.550> on<00:06:02.699> a<00:06:02.729> daily<00:06:02.940> basis<00:06:03.419> literally<00:06:03.930> only<00:06:04.199> one

00:06:04.460 --> 00:06:04.470 
use on a daily basis literally only one

00:06:04.470 --> 00:06:08.090 
use on a daily basis literally only one
to<00:06:05.039> two<00:06:05.340> that<00:06:05.550> I<00:06:05.610> use<00:06:05.639> a<00:06:06.150> daily<00:06:06.870> and<00:06:07.380> I<00:06:07.949> don't

00:06:08.090 --> 00:06:08.100 
to two that I use a daily and I don't

00:06:08.100 --> 00:06:09.650

00:06:09.650 --> 00:06:09.660 
know they work for me but I think all of

00:06:09.660 --> 00:06:11.930 
know they work for me but I think all of
this<00:06:09.750> is<00:06:09.930> due<00:06:10.080> to<00:06:10.110> accutane<00:06:10.710> I<00:06:10.949> could<00:06:11.160> I<00:06:11.370> can't

00:06:11.930 --> 00:06:11.940 
this is due to accutane I could I can't

00:06:11.940 --> 00:06:14.900 
this is due to accutane I could I can't
really<00:06:12.150> like<00:06:12.630> say<00:06:13.440> anything<00:06:13.979> much<00:06:14.610> better

00:06:14.900 --> 00:06:14.910 
really like say anything much better

00:06:14.910 --> 00:06:16.490 
really like say anything much better
about<00:06:15.150> it<00:06:15.210> it<00:06:15.479> really<00:06:15.510> like<00:06:15.930> changed<00:06:16.289> the<00:06:16.410> way

00:06:16.490 --> 00:06:16.500 
about it it really like changed the way

00:06:16.500 --> 00:06:20.510 
about it it really like changed the way
that<00:06:16.650> I<00:06:17.000> look<00:06:18.000> and<00:06:18.240> I<00:06:18.539> love<00:06:19.470> that<00:06:19.650> I<00:06:19.710> was<00:06:20.100> on<00:06:20.340> it

00:06:20.510 --> 00:06:20.520 
that I look and I love that I was on it

00:06:20.520 --> 00:06:22.189 
that I look and I love that I was on it
I<00:06:20.639> think<00:06:20.699> it<00:06:20.910> was<00:06:21.000> great<00:06:21.150> thing<00:06:21.750> that<00:06:21.900> I<00:06:21.930> did

00:06:22.189 --> 00:06:22.199 
I think it was great thing that I did

00:06:22.199 --> 00:06:23.900 
I think it was great thing that I did
but<00:06:22.770> you<00:06:22.860> do<00:06:22.979> definitely<00:06:23.250> have<00:06:23.430> to<00:06:23.610> research

00:06:23.900 --> 00:06:23.910 
but you do definitely have to research

00:06:23.910 --> 00:06:25.820 
but you do definitely have to research
it<00:06:24.150> and<00:06:24.180> look<00:06:24.360> into<00:06:24.570> it<00:06:24.720> I<00:06:24.900> think<00:06:25.169> that<00:06:25.350> I<00:06:25.530> was

00:06:25.820 --> 00:06:25.830 
it and look into it I think that I was

00:06:25.830 --> 00:06:27.830 
it and look into it I think that I was
really<00:06:26.220> like<00:06:26.400> prone<00:06:26.760> to<00:06:26.970> do<00:06:27.150> it<00:06:27.300> because<00:06:27.539> my

00:06:27.830 --> 00:06:27.840 
really like prone to do it because my

00:06:27.840 --> 00:06:30.170 
really like prone to do it because my
brother<00:06:28.080> did<00:06:28.320> it<00:06:28.440> report<00:06:28.889> me<00:06:29.010> and<00:06:29.220> so<00:06:29.970> I

00:06:30.170 --> 00:06:30.180 
brother did it report me and so I

00:06:30.180 --> 00:06:31.670 
brother did it report me and so I
thought<00:06:30.450> outcome<00:06:30.900> that<00:06:31.020> he<00:06:31.169> had<00:06:31.380> and<00:06:31.500> I<00:06:31.560> was

00:06:31.670 --> 00:06:31.680
