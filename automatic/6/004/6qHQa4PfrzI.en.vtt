corpus boss the only way to damage them

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:30.410 
corpus boss the only way to damage them
is<00:01:29.009> to<00:01:29.130> hit<00:01:29.280> their<00:01:29.490> jet<00:01:29.729> packs<00:01:30.000> which<00:01:30.270> is

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
is to hit their jet packs which is

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:31.940 
is to hit their jet packs which is
pretty<00:01:30.570> annoying<00:01:30.900> considering<00:01:31.560> they<00:01:31.680> fly

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
pretty annoying considering they fly

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:33.590
