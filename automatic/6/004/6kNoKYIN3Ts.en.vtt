vindictive gaming in as you guys can see
i'll<00:00:11.519> look<00:00:11.610> a<00:00:11.730> little<00:00:11.849> bit<00:00:12.030> different<00:00:12.420> and

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:12.540 
i'll look a little bit different and

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:13.970 
i'll look a little bit different and
that's<00:00:12.719> mainly<00:00:13.019> because<00:00:13.170> we<00:00:13.620> got<00:00:13.740> a<00:00:13.799> new

00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:13.980 
that's mainly because we got a new

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:15.650 
that's mainly because we got a new
texture<00:00:14.340> pack<00:00:14.610> so<00:00:14.820> the<00:00:14.969> new<00:00:15.059> texture<00:00:15.389> pack<00:00:15.509> is

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:15.660 
texture pack so the new texture pack is

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:17.689 
texture pack so the new texture pack is

and it still looks very good in that

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:47.630 
and it still looks very good in that
that's<00:00:46.710> mainly<00:00:46.890> because<00:00:47.010> I<00:00:47.250> use<00:00:47.399> a<00:00:47.430> lot<00:00:47.520> of

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
that's mainly because I use a lot of

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:49.729 
that's mainly because I use a lot of
breaks<00:00:47.910> but<00:00:48.210> it<00:00:48.809> looks<00:00:48.960> amazing<00:00:49.140> i<00:00:49.440> like<00:00:49.590> it<00:00:49.710> so

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
breaks but it looks amazing i like it so

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:51.200 
breaks but it looks amazing i like it so
i<00:00:50.160> really<00:00:50.489> wouldn't<00:00:50.640> use<00:00:50.789> it<00:00:50.820> too<00:00:51.030> much<00:00:51.149> just

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:51.210 
i really wouldn't use it too much just

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:52.580 
i really wouldn't use it too much just
because<00:00:51.510> I'm<00:00:51.780> going<00:00:51.930> for<00:00:52.110> the<00:00:52.140> more<00:00:52.289> modern

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:52.590 
because I'm going for the more modern

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:54.920 
because I'm going for the more modern
theme<00:00:52.800> but<00:00:53.460> um<00:00:53.610> I<00:00:53.789> definitely<00:00:54.180> applaud<00:00:54.690> them

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930 
theme but um I definitely applaud them

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:56.240 
theme but um I definitely applaud them
on<00:00:55.079> this<00:00:55.199> texture<00:00:55.500> practice<00:00:55.800> is<00:00:55.920> probably<00:00:56.129> one

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
on this texture practice is probably one

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:57.470 
on this texture practice is probably one
of<00:00:56.280> the<00:00:56.430> better<00:00:56.550> ones<00:00:56.670> that<00:00:57.030> I<00:00:57.059> think<00:00:57.270> it<00:00:57.360> looks

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
of the better ones that I think it looks

00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:59.180 
of the better ones that I think it looks
amazing<00:00:57.539> especially<00:00:58.260> like<00:00:58.590> the<00:00:58.710> glowstone

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190 
amazing especially like the glowstone

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:00.979

we're<00:01:03.000> working<00:01:03.390> on<00:01:03.539> the<00:01:03.840> third<00:01:04.019> floor<00:01:04.229> third

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
we're working on the third floor third

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:06.020 
we're working on the third floor third
floor<00:01:04.680> is<00:01:04.979> probably<00:01:05.339> one<00:01:05.489> of<00:01:05.519> the<00:01:05.670> only<00:01:05.700> force

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
floor is probably one of the only force

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:07.760 
floor is probably one of the only force
that<00:01:06.090> didn't<00:01:06.390> have<00:01:06.510> anything<00:01:06.689> on<00:01:06.900> it<00:01:07.049> and<00:01:07.320> we

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
that didn't have anything on it and we

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:09.830 
that didn't have anything on it and we
finally<00:01:08.159> started<00:01:08.460> like<00:01:08.640> organizing<00:01:09.119> and<00:01:09.479> like

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
finally started like organizing and like

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:11.270 
finally started like organizing and like
laying<00:01:10.110> it<00:01:10.260> out<00:01:10.350> and<00:01:10.590> seeing<00:01:10.770> what<00:01:10.950> we<00:01:11.070> want

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
laying it out and seeing what we want

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:12.950 
laying it out and seeing what we want

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 
and we're getting really close so i

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:14.570 
and we're getting really close so i
would<00:01:13.350> say<00:01:13.560> we're<00:01:13.740> about<00:01:13.950> seventy<00:01:14.430> percent

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
would say we're about seventy percent

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:16.280 
would say we're about seventy percent

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:22.800 
recommends something and I use in my

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:24.890 
recommends something and I use in my
hotel<00:02:23.190> you<00:02:23.520> get<00:02:23.640> a<00:02:23.670> free<00:02:23.880> room<00:02:24.120> I'm<00:02:24.690> going<00:02:24.840> to

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:24.900 
hotel you get a free room I'm going to

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:26.000 
hotel you get a free room I'm going to
show<00:02:25.020> you<00:02:25.080> some<00:02:25.230> of<00:02:25.260> the<00:02:25.349> rooms<00:02:25.500> we<00:02:25.739> actually

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:26.010 
show you some of the rooms we actually

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:27.559 
show you some of the rooms we actually
added<00:02:26.099> a<00:02:26.370> whole<00:02:26.580> nother<00:02:26.819> layer<00:02:27.060> of<00:02:27.270> room<00:02:27.420> so

00:02:27.559 --> 00:02:27.569 
added a whole nother layer of room so

00:02:27.569 --> 00:02:28.760 
added a whole nother layer of room so
think<00:02:27.720> it's<00:02:27.840> like<00:02:27.930> four<00:02:28.170> different<00:02:28.319> rooms<00:02:28.620> are

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:28.770 
think it's like four different rooms are

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:30.860 
think it's like four different rooms are
very<00:02:28.800> big<00:02:29.190> with<00:02:29.760> only<00:02:30.000> one<00:02:30.239> bed<00:02:30.450> so<00:02:30.660> if<00:02:30.780> you

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:30.870 
very big with only one bed so if you

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:32.360 
very big with only one bed so if you
