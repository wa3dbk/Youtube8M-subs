almost<00:00:55.350> any<00:00:56.039> light<00:00:56.549> fixture<00:00:57.329> and<00:00:57.889> have<00:00:58.889> this

00:00:59.059 --> 00:00:59.069 
almost any light fixture and have this

00:00:59.069 --> 00:01:01.969 
almost any light fixture and have this
work<00:00:59.399> I<00:00:59.670> say<00:01:00.029> almost<00:01:00.269> any<00:01:00.690> fixture<00:01:01.350> because<00:01:01.709> it

00:01:01.969 --> 00:01:01.979 
work I say almost any fixture because it

00:01:01.979 --> 00:01:04.459 
work I say almost any fixture because it
is<00:01:02.100> only<00:01:02.309> one<00:01:02.760> size<00:01:03.089> so<00:01:03.510> if<00:01:03.659> the<00:01:03.779> sockets<00:01:04.170> too

00:01:04.459 --> 00:01:04.469 
is only one size so if the sockets too

00:01:04.469 --> 00:01:06.709 
is only one size so if the sockets too
big<00:01:04.710> or<00:01:05.100> too<00:01:05.159> small<00:01:05.460> it's<00:01:06.030> not<00:01:06.299> going<00:01:06.479> to<00:01:06.570> fit

00:01:06.709 --> 00:01:06.719 
big or too small it's not going to fit

00:01:06.719 --> 00:01:08.810 
big or too small it's not going to fit
but<00:01:06.930> it<00:01:07.020> is<00:01:07.109> made<00:01:07.320> to<00:01:07.350> fit<00:01:07.680> most<00:01:07.950> standard<00:01:08.549> size

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820 
but it is made to fit most standard size

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:10.639 
but it is made to fit most standard size
light<00:01:09.450> sockets<00:01:09.960> one<00:01:10.320> of<00:01:10.380> the<00:01:10.439> great<00:01:10.619> things

00:01:10.639 --> 00:01:10.649 
light sockets one of the great things

00:01:10.649 --> 00:01:12.830 
light sockets one of the great things
about<00:01:10.890> this<00:01:11.189> is<00:01:11.399> I<00:01:11.939> know<00:01:12.000> I<00:01:12.119> personally<00:01:12.299> am

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
about this is I know I personally am

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:14.840 
about this is I know I personally am
probably<00:01:13.200> going<00:01:13.439> to<00:01:13.590> use<00:01:13.740> this<00:01:13.920> in<00:01:14.130> my<00:01:14.430> bedroom

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:29.280 
want me to say it is super convenient

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:30.919 
want me to say it is super convenient
because<00:01:29.640> it<00:01:29.939> does<00:01:30.179> come<00:01:30.479> with<00:01:30.600> a<00:01:30.659> remote

00:01:30.919 --> 00:01:30.929

because it does come with a remote
control<00:01:31.219> hooking<00:01:32.219> this<00:01:32.369> up<00:01:32.549> is<00:01:32.759> super<00:01:33.270> easy

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299 
control hooking this up is super easy

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:36.080 
control hooking this up is super easy
it's<00:01:33.929> literally<00:01:34.350> only<00:01:34.679> three<00:01:35.039> steps<00:01:35.310> so<00:01:35.969> the

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
it's literally only three steps so the

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:37.669 
it's literally only three steps so the
first<00:01:36.329> step<00:01:36.450> is<00:01:36.689> you<00:01:36.810> want<00:01:37.020> to<00:01:37.079> make<00:01:37.289> sure<00:01:37.320> that

00:01:37.669 --> 00:01:37.679 
first step is you want to make sure that

00:01:37.679 --> 00:01:38.929 
first step is you want to make sure that
the<00:01:37.799> light<00:01:37.979> switch<00:01:38.249> or<00:01:38.429> lamp<00:01:38.609> that<00:01:38.789> you're

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:40.079 
going to be hooking this up to is

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:42.139 
going to be hooking this up to is
powered<00:01:40.619> off<00:01:41.039> once<00:01:41.640> it's<00:01:41.789> off<00:01:41.939> you're<00:01:42.119> just

00:01:42.139 --> 00:01:42.149 
powered off once it's off you're just

00:01:42.149 --> 00:01:44.149 
powered off once it's off you're just
going<00:01:42.390> to<00:01:42.450> go<00:01:42.539> ahead<00:01:42.659> and<00:01:43.049> screw<00:01:43.619> that<00:01:43.770> into

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:44.159 
going to go ahead and screw that into

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:54.720 
going to go ahead and screw that into
the<00:01:44.280> empty<00:01:44.670> light<00:01:44.850> fixture

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:54.730 

00:01:54.730 --> 00:01:56.910 

step<00:01:55.510> 2<00:01:55.750> you're<00:01:56.140> going<00:01:56.290> to<00:01:56.350> turn<00:01:56.500> the<00:01:56.620> light<00:01:56.740> on
