00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:37.580 
I didn't realize it was gonna be this

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:42.790 
I didn't realize it was gonna be this
small<00:01:39.310> when<00:01:40.310> you<00:01:40.430> do<00:01:40.610> this<00:01:41.680> attached<00:01:42.680> a

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:42.800 
small when you do this attached a

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:53.880 
small when you do this attached a
competition<00:01:43.220> timer<00:01:50.350> there<00:01:51.350> we<00:01:51.440> go

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:53.890 

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:56.080 

that's<00:01:54.890> the<00:01:55.010> mini<00:01:55.190> stack<00:01:55.460> right<00:01:55.670> I<00:01:55.850> didn't

00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:56.090 
that's the mini stack right I didn't

00:01:56.090 --> 00:02:00.280 
that's the mini stack right I didn't
realize<00:01:56.360> it<00:01:56.540> was<00:01:56.630> this<00:01:56.870> tiny<00:01:58.690> but<00:01:59.690> if<00:01:59.930> I<00:02:00.080> wanted

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:00.290

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:03.380 
to just carry it around I can just

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:08.350 
to just carry it around I can just
attach<00:02:04.130> it<00:02:04.160> to<00:02:04.430> that<00:02:04.490> no<00:02:05.330> big<00:02:05.540> deal<00:02:05.750> um<00:02:07.360> yeah

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:20.150 
you can probably see that signed by

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:25.140 
you can probably see that signed by

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:53.780 
get a bunch of cubers to sign it when I

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:56.380 
get a bunch of cubers to sign it when I
meet<00:02:54.019> them<00:02:54.640> so<00:02:55.640> yeah<00:02:55.790> that<00:02:56.000> was<00:02:56.090> my<00:02:56.150> unboxing
