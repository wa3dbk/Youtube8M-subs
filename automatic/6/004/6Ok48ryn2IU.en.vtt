that doesn't mean that it will be for
you<00:00:45.960> so<00:00:46.350> keep<00:00:46.680> that<00:00:46.800> in<00:00:46.860> mind<00:00:47.160> while<00:00:47.340> I<00:00:47.400> go<00:00:47.640> over

you so keep that in mind while I go over

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:50.330 
you so keep that in mind while I go over

this so to start off with it is not as

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:52.670 
this so to start off with it is not as

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
classes however in battlefield hardline

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:06.980 
classes however in battlefield hardline
every<00:01:05.070> single<00:01:05.430> class<00:01:05.670> has<00:01:05.970> exclusive<00:01:06.600> weapons

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
and for the operator that consists of

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:12.170 
and for the operator that consists of
both<00:01:09.450> the<00:01:09.509> carbines<00:01:10.290> and<00:01:10.560> the<00:01:11.399> assault<00:01:11.759> rifles

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 
both the carbines and the assault rifles

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:14.540 
both the carbines and the assault rifles
so<00:01:12.840> what<00:01:13.590> they<00:01:13.740> have<00:01:13.830> done<00:01:13.950> within<00:01:14.159> this<00:01:14.370> game

in<00:01:14.729> order<00:01:14.820> to<00:01:14.970> make<00:01:15.120> it<00:01:15.270> so<00:01:15.390> that<00:01:15.420> carbines<00:01:15.990> are

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229 
in order to make it so that carbines are

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:18.230 
in order to make it so that carbines are
not<00:01:16.470> overshadowed<00:01:17.250> by<00:01:17.400> the<00:01:17.460> assault<00:01:17.880> rifles

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 
not overshadowed by the assault rifles

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:19.820 
not overshadowed by the assault rifles
is<00:01:18.450> they<00:01:18.600> have<00:01:18.720> given<00:01:19.020> them<00:01:19.140> very<00:01:19.409> similar

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830 
is they have given them very similar

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:21.950 
is they have given them very similar
characteristics<00:01:20.250> and<00:01:20.820> statistics<00:01:21.570> so

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960 
characteristics and statistics so

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:23.870 
characteristics and statistics so
whenever<00:01:22.560> you<00:01:22.770> look<00:01:22.860> at<00:01:22.950> the<00:01:23.100> damage<00:01:23.310> models

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
whenever you look at the damage models

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:25.880 
whenever you look at the damage models
the<00:01:24.030> rate<00:01:24.180> of<00:01:24.299> fires<00:01:24.540> the<00:01:24.990> damage<00:01:25.380> drop-off

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
the rate of fires the damage drop-off

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:27.530 
the rate of fires the damage drop-off
and<00:01:26.130> things<00:01:26.310> like<00:01:26.460> that<00:01:26.520> for<00:01:27.210> all<00:01:27.390> of<00:01:27.420> the

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:27.540 
and things like that for all of the

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:29.960 
and things like that for all of the
carbines<00:01:28.110> they<00:01:28.740> do<00:01:28.799> stack<00:01:29.220> up<00:01:29.460> very<00:01:29.640> well

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:29.970 
carbines they do stack up very well

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:31.940 
carbines they do stack up very well
against<00:01:30.479> the<00:01:30.570> assault<00:01:30.870> rifles<00:01:31.260> giving<00:01:31.590> them<00:01:31.740> a

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
against the assault rifles giving them a

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:34.039 
against the assault rifles giving them a
very<00:01:32.430> similar<00:01:32.790> image<00:01:33.299> whenever<00:01:33.600> you<00:01:33.720> look<00:01:33.900> at

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:34.049 
very similar image whenever you look at

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:35.810 
very similar image whenever you look at
them<00:01:34.200> at<00:01:34.290> first<00:01:34.440> glance<00:01:34.799> at<00:01:35.310> this<00:01:35.460> point<00:01:35.729> in

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820 
them at first glance at this point in

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:37.550 
them at first glance at this point in
time<00:01:35.970> there<00:01:36.180> are<00:01:36.210> three<00:01:36.540> main<00:01:36.870> weapons<00:01:37.320> in<00:01:37.470> the

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:38.940 
operator class that everybody thinks

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:40.640 
operator class that everybody thinks
could<00:01:39.360> possibly<00:01:39.750> be<00:01:39.930> the<00:01:40.080> best<00:01:40.290> for<00:01:40.530> those

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:40.650 
could possibly be the best for those

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:42.859 
could possibly be the best for those
classes<00:01:41.190> those<00:01:41.790> three<00:01:42.030> weapons<00:01:42.360> are<00:01:42.630> the

reason<00:01:47.220> being<00:01:47.430> is<00:01:47.729> that<00:01:47.760> they<00:01:48.000> are<00:01:48.119> all<00:01:48.270> very

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:48.540 
reason being is that they are all very

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:50.600 
reason being is that they are all very

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:03.800 
comparing an apple to two oranges so
there<00:02:02.729> are<00:02:02.939> going<00:02:03.180> to<00:02:03.240> be<00:02:03.299> some<00:02:03.540> various

00:04:39.089 --> 00:04:39.099 
because it's rate of fire is pretty much

having that increased spread is what

00:04:44.139 --> 00:04:45.540 
having that increased spread is what

at<00:05:17.770> this<00:05:17.979> point<00:05:18.250> since<00:05:18.460> you<00:05:18.610> if<00:05:18.879> you<00:05:19.150> didn't

00:05:19.439 --> 00:05:19.449 
at this point since you if you didn't

00:05:19.449 --> 00:05:20.879 
at this point since you if you didn't
already<00:05:19.599> preorder<00:05:20.169> it<00:05:20.199> that's<00:05:20.469> the<00:05:20.590> only<00:05:20.770> way

00:05:20.879 --> 00:05:20.889 
already preorder it that's the only way

00:05:20.889 --> 00:05:23.219 
already preorder it that's the only way
you<00:05:20.949> can<00:05:21.129> get<00:05:21.370> it<00:05:21.520> but<00:05:21.759> to<00:05:22.419> be<00:05:22.539> honest<00:05:22.900> that's

00:05:23.219 --> 00:05:23.229 
you can get it but to be honest that's

00:05:23.229 --> 00:05:25.499 
you can get it but to be honest that's
not<00:05:23.469> necessarily<00:05:23.889> true<00:05:24.039> the<00:05:24.400> acw-r<00:05:24.939> is<00:05:25.180> great

00:05:25.499 --> 00:05:25.509 
not necessarily true the acw-r is great

00:05:25.509 --> 00:05:27.269 
not necessarily true the acw-r is great
I<00:05:25.659> think<00:05:25.960> it<00:05:26.050> is<00:05:26.199> probably<00:05:26.349> the<00:05:26.590> best<00:05:26.860> weapon

00:05:27.269 --> 00:05:27.279 
I think it is probably the best weapon

00:05:27.279 --> 00:05:30.330 
I think it is probably the best weapon
for<00:05:27.430> the<00:05:27.520> operator<00:05:27.819> class<00:05:28.060> but<00:05:28.930> as<00:05:29.139> I<00:05:29.469> said<00:05:29.800> it

00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:30.340 
for the operator class but as I said it

00:05:30.340 --> 00:05:34.140 
for the operator class but as I said it
in<00:05:30.639> the<00:05:30.819> m16a3<00:05:31.539> the<00:05:31.960> m416<00:05:32.620> are<00:05:32.860> also<00:05:33.039> even<00:05:33.969> in

00:05:34.140 --> 00:05:34.150 
in the m16a3 the m416 are also even in

00:05:34.150 --> 00:05:36.510 
in the m16a3 the m416 are also even in
most<00:05:34.659> of<00:05:34.840> their<00:05:34.960> statistics<00:05:35.620> that<00:05:36.099> even<00:05:36.430> if

00:05:36.510 --> 00:05:36.520 
most of their statistics that even if

00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:38.129 
most of their statistics that even if
you<00:05:36.639> don't<00:05:36.849> have<00:05:37.000> the<00:05:37.060> acw-r<00:05:37.659> you're<00:05:38.020> gonna

00:05:38.129 --> 00:05:38.139 
you don't have the acw-r you're gonna

00:05:38.139 --> 00:05:40.110 
you don't have the acw-r you're gonna
find<00:05:38.379> yourself<00:05:38.490> easily<00:05:39.490> at<00:05:39.610> home<00:05:39.639> with<00:05:40.029> the

00:05:40.110 --> 00:05:40.120 
find yourself easily at home with the

00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:43.320 
find yourself easily at home with the
m16a3<00:05:40.719> and<00:05:40.839> m416<00:05:41.710> thus<00:05:42.490> showing<00:05:42.940> that<00:05:43.120> the

00:05:43.320 --> 00:05:43.330 
m16a3 and m416 thus showing that the

00:05:43.330 --> 00:05:44.610 
m16a3 and m416 thus showing that the
weapon<00:05:43.690> balance<00:05:44.020> in<00:05:44.199> battlefield<00:05:44.589> hardline

00:05:44.610 --> 00:05:44.620 
weapon balance in battlefield hardline

00:05:44.620 --> 00:05:47.279 
weapon balance in battlefield hardline
is<00:05:45.069> very<00:05:45.490> very<00:05:45.879> good<00:05:46.210> and<00:05:46.419> even<00:05:47.050> though<00:05:47.139> the

00:05:47.279 --> 00:05:47.289 
is very very good and even though the

00:05:47.289 --> 00:05:49.829 
is very very good and even though the
acw-r<00:05:47.919> is<00:05:48.279> slightly<00:05:49.029> better<00:05:49.360> in<00:05:49.479> some

00:05:49.829 --> 00:05:49.839 
acw-r is slightly better in some

00:05:49.839 --> 00:05:52.950 
acw-r is slightly better in some
situations<00:05:50.560> than<00:05:50.800> the<00:05:50.949> m16<00:05:51.460> and<00:05:51.580> in<00:05:51.699> 416<00:05:52.389> that

00:05:52.950 --> 00:05:52.960 
situations than the m16 and in 416 that

00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:55.439 
situations than the m16 and in 416 that
does<00:05:53.229> not<00:05:53.409> mean<00:05:53.710> that<00:05:53.949> it<00:05:54.400> will<00:05:54.759> replace<00:05:55.089> them

00:05:55.439 --> 00:05:55.449 
does not mean that it will replace them

00:05:55.449 --> 00:05:57.269 
does not mean that it will replace them
completely<00:05:55.900> and<00:05:56.050> that<00:05:56.259> if<00:05:56.440> you<00:05:56.589> don't<00:05:56.800> have<00:05:57.099> it

00:05:57.269 --> 00:05:57.279 
completely and that if you don't have it

00:05:57.279 --> 00:05:58.680 
completely and that if you don't have it
you're<00:05:57.400> just<00:05:57.610> going<00:05:57.759> to<00:05:57.849> get<00:05:58.000> destroyed<00:05:58.389> by<00:05:58.629> it

00:05:58.680 --> 00:05:58.690 
you're just going to get destroyed by it

00:05:58.690 --> 00:06:00.749 
you're just going to get destroyed by it
because<00:05:59.080> the<00:05:59.680> gunfights<00:06:00.159> will<00:06:00.339> end<00:06:00.490> up<00:06:00.580> being

00:06:00.749 --> 00:06:00.759 
because the gunfights will end up being

00:06:00.759 --> 00:06:02.579 
because the gunfights will end up being
very<00:06:01.089> even<00:06:01.509> and<00:06:01.599> very<00:06:01.810> fair<00:06:02.110> between<00:06:02.259> those

00:06:02.579 --> 00:06:02.589 
very even and very fair between those

00:06:02.589 --> 00:06:04.709 
very even and very fair between those
weapons<00:06:02.770> and<00:06:03.190> basically<00:06:03.969> all<00:06:04.150> you're<00:06:04.360> getting

00:06:04.709 --> 00:06:04.719 
weapons and basically all you're getting

00:06:04.719 --> 00:06:07.529 
weapons and basically all you're getting
when<00:06:04.960> the<00:06:05.020> acw-r<00:06:05.620> is<00:06:06.009> an<00:06:06.430> early<00:06:06.849> unlock<00:06:07.300> for

00:06:07.529 --> 00:06:07.539 
when the acw-r is an early unlock for

00:06:07.539 --> 00:06:08.700 
when the acw-r is an early unlock for
those<00:06:07.689> of<00:06:07.779> you<00:06:07.839> who<00:06:07.930> do<00:06:08.080> have<00:06:08.199> the<00:06:08.259> digital

those of you who do have the digital

those of you who do have the digital

00:06:10.360 --> 00:06:12.089 
deluxe or did pre-order the game is
you're<00:06:10.839> basically<00:06:11.169> just<00:06:11.439> getting<00:06:11.710> early

00:06:12.089 --> 00:06:12.099 
you're basically just getting early

00:06:12.099 --> 00:06:14.969 
you're basically just getting early
access<00:06:12.580> to<00:06:12.819> an<00:06:12.939> m16<00:06:13.509> or<00:06:13.659> m4<00:06:13.689> 16<00:06:14.500> just<00:06:14.800> with<00:06:14.949> a

access to an m16 or m4 16 just with a
different<00:06:15.129> name<00:06:15.639> so<00:06:16.060> overall<00:06:16.930> that's<00:06:17.289> my

00:06:17.519 --> 00:06:17.529 
different name so overall that's my

00:06:17.529 --> 00:06:19.679 
different name so overall that's my
opinion<00:06:17.860> as<00:06:17.979> to<00:06:18.009> why<00:06:18.339> the<00:06:18.400> acw-r<00:06:19.120> is<00:06:19.389> the

00:06:19.679 --> 00:06:19.689 
opinion as to why the acw-r is the

00:06:19.689 --> 00:06:22.079 
opinion as to why the acw-r is the
better<00:06:19.990> gun<00:06:20.349> for<00:06:20.949> the<00:06:21.099> operator<00:06:21.550> class<00:06:21.789> in

00:06:22.079 --> 00:06:22.089 
better gun for the operator class in

00:06:22.089 --> 00:06:23.909 
better gun for the operator class in
battlefield<00:06:22.479> hardline<00:06:22.509> if<00:06:23.020> you<00:06:23.409> guys<00:06:23.589> think
