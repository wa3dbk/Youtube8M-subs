like 68 degrees outside that's really

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:13.670 
like 68 degrees outside that's really
matter

gain<00:04:18.010> on<00:04:18.250> all<00:04:18.430> this<00:04:18.640> Pokemon<00:04:19.120> at<00:04:19.299> least<00:04:19.630> so

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:20.440 
gain on all this Pokemon at least so

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:23.070 
gain on all this Pokemon at least so
this<00:04:20.739> is<00:04:20.769> just<00:04:21.010> a<00:04:21.160> matter<00:04:21.820> of<00:04:21.970> getting<00:04:22.060> off<00:04:22.540> all

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:23.080 
this is just a matter of getting off all

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:25.410 
this is just a matter of getting off all
of<00:04:23.320> his<00:04:23.410> Pokemon<00:04:23.830> taken<00:04:24.220> care<00:04:24.430> of<00:04:24.460> with<00:04:24.880> just

00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:25.420 
of his Pokemon taken care of with just

00:04:25.420 --> 00:04:29.020 
of his Pokemon taken care of with just
one<00:04:25.660> shot<00:04:25.900> I<00:04:25.960> guess

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:29.030 

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:32.350 

with<00:04:29.750> this<00:04:29.810> level<00:04:30.170> 73<00:04:30.770> versus<00:04:31.190> over<00:04:31.430> 48<00:04:31.970> that's

00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:32.360 
with this level 73 versus over 48 that's

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:35.020 
with this level 73 versus over 48 that's
a<00:04:32.780> pretty<00:04:33.470> big<00:04:33.680> difference<00:04:33.920> it's<00:04:34.550> like<00:04:34.850> that

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:35.030 
a pretty big difference it's like that

00:04:35.030 --> 00:04:37.240 
a pretty big difference it's like that
with<00:04:35.060> all<00:04:35.270> this<00:04:35.480> pokemon<00:04:36.020> i<00:04:36.320> guess<00:04:37.070> that's

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:37.250 
with all this pokemon i guess that's

00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:42.000 
with all this pokemon i guess that's
just<00:04:37.310> because<00:04:37.550> i'm<00:04:37.760> over<00:04:38.060> double<00:04:38.420> whatever

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:42.010
