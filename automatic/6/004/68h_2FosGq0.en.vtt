cards<00:01:53.810> this<00:01:53.929> one<00:01:54.079> has<00:01:54.200> been<00:01:54.320> modified

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:54.560 
cards this one has been modified

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:57.639 
cards this one has been modified
specifically<00:01:55.189> to<00:01:55.429> fit<00:01:55.670> on<00:01:55.969> this<00:01:56.600> PCB<00:01:57.200> which<00:01:57.499> is

00:01:57.639 --> 00:01:57.649 
specifically to fit on this PCB which is

00:01:57.649 --> 00:02:00.580 
specifically to fit on this PCB which is
the<00:01:57.799> it's<00:01:58.460> a<00:01:58.549> gk110<00:01:59.359> and<00:01:59.780> this<00:01:59.929> this<00:02:00.079> really<00:02:00.289> I

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:00.590 
the it's a gk110 and this this really I

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:03.880 
the it's a gk110 and this this really I
mean<00:02:01.100> it's<00:02:01.219> really<00:02:01.369> the<00:02:01.990> only<00:02:02.990> graphics<00:02:03.619> card

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:03.890 
mean it's really the only graphics card

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:06.700 
mean it's really the only graphics card
a<00:02:04.159> gaming<00:02:04.969> great<00:02:05.240> graphics<00:02:05.630> card<00:02:05.840> that's<00:02:06.380> kind

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:06.710 
a gaming great graphics card that's kind

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:09.279 
a gaming great graphics card that's kind
of<00:02:06.770> fully<00:02:07.070> taken<00:02:07.460> advantage<00:02:07.909> of<00:02:08.300> the<00:02:08.450> gk110<00:02:09.050> I

00:02:09.279 --> 00:02:09.289 
of fully taken advantage of the gk110 I

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:12.009 
of fully taken advantage of the gk110 I
mean<00:02:09.470> the<00:02:09.560> Titan<00:02:09.950> is<00:02:10.220> is<00:02:10.459> really<00:02:10.789> fast<00:02:11.060> but<00:02:11.390> you

00:02:12.009 --> 00:02:12.019 
mean the Titan is is really fast but you

00:02:12.019 --> 00:02:14.070 
mean the Titan is is really fast but you
know<00:02:12.140> this<00:02:12.319> is<00:02:12.440> a<00:02:12.470> step<00:02:12.739> up<00:02:12.890> from<00:02:13.099> even

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:14.080 
know this is a step up from even

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:17.290 
know this is a step up from even
in<00:02:15.080> most<00:02:15.440> areas<00:02:15.860> except<00:02:16.129> for<00:02:16.370> possibly<00:02:16.790> Ram

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:17.300 
in most areas except for possibly Ram

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:19.809 
in most areas except for possibly Ram
but<00:02:17.510> I<00:02:17.690> mean<00:02:17.930> Rams<00:02:18.560> faster<00:02:19.040> so<00:02:19.190> we'll<00:02:19.670> get<00:02:19.760> to

00:02:19.809 --> 00:02:19.819 
but I mean Rams faster so we'll get to

00:02:19.819 --> 00:02:21.729 
but I mean Rams faster so we'll get to
that<00:02:19.849> again<00:02:20.299> in<00:02:20.510> a<00:02:20.540> second<00:02:20.959> all<00:02:21.500> right<00:02:21.530> let's

00:02:21.729 --> 00:02:21.739 
that again in a second all right let's

00:02:21.739 --> 00:02:23.380 
that again in a second all right let's
talk<00:02:21.799> about<00:02:21.860> that<00:02:22.040> AC<00:02:22.280> X<00:02:22.489> cooling<00:02:22.790> unit<00:02:23.030> what

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:23.390 
talk about that AC X cooling unit what

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:25.539 
talk about that AC X cooling unit what
really<00:02:23.540> sets<00:02:23.810> us<00:02:23.930> apart<00:02:24.049> from<00:02:24.260> you<00:02:25.190> know<00:02:25.310> just

00:02:25.539 --> 00:02:25.549 
really sets us apart from you know just

00:02:25.549 --> 00:02:28.809 
really sets us apart from you know just
a<00:02:25.640> stock<00:02:26.110> 780ti<00:02:27.110> well<00:02:27.860> you've<00:02:28.010> got<00:02:28.159> 40%<00:02:28.459> more

00:02:28.809 --> 00:02:28.819 
a stock 780ti well you've got 40% more

00:02:28.819 --> 00:02:31.059 
a stock 780ti well you've got 40% more
volume<00:02:29.269> and<00:02:29.420> that<00:02:30.260> is<00:02:30.470> going<00:02:30.709> to<00:02:30.769> help<00:02:30.860> you

00:02:31.059 --> 00:02:31.069 
volume and that is going to help you

00:02:31.069 --> 00:02:33.309 
volume and that is going to help you
dissipate<00:02:31.489> 40<00:02:31.940> percent<00:02:32.209> is<00:02:32.330> quite<00:02:32.720> a<00:02:32.840> lot<00:02:33.080> to

00:02:33.309 --> 00:02:33.319 
dissipate 40 percent is quite a lot to

00:02:33.319 --> 00:02:35.140 
dissipate 40 percent is quite a lot to
fit<00:02:33.680> into<00:02:33.830> a<00:02:33.920> small<00:02:34.190> area<00:02:34.400> but<00:02:34.700> it's<00:02:35.060> still

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:35.150 
fit into a small area but it's still

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:37.119 
fit into a small area but it's still
just<00:02:35.209> a<00:02:35.420> dual<00:02:35.569> slot<00:02:35.810> card<00:02:36.049> so<00:02:36.410> that's<00:02:36.590> all<00:02:36.769> good

00:02:37.119 --> 00:02:37.129 
just a dual slot card so that's all good

00:02:37.129 --> 00:02:39.309 
just a dual slot card so that's all good
also<00:02:37.519> we<00:02:37.640> have<00:02:37.730> dual<00:02:37.940> ball<00:02:38.420> bearing<00:02:38.750> fans<00:02:39.049> and

00:02:39.309 --> 00:02:39.319 
also we have dual ball bearing fans and

00:02:39.319 --> 00:02:40.660 
also we have dual ball bearing fans and
the<00:02:39.410> average<00:02:39.650> lifespan<00:02:39.860> on<00:02:40.069> those<00:02:40.280> I<00:02:40.400> believe

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:40.670 
the average lifespan on those I believe

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:42.309 
the average lifespan on those I believe
is<00:02:40.849> 12<00:02:41.180> years<00:02:41.540> you<00:02:41.870> can<00:02:41.989> check<00:02:42.140> their<00:02:42.290> website

00:02:42.309 --> 00:02:42.319 
is 12 years you can check their website

00:02:42.319 --> 00:02:45.280 
is 12 years you can check their website
for<00:02:42.799> the<00:02:42.920> actual<00:02:43.690> you<00:02:44.690> know<00:02:44.720> notes<00:02:45.019> on<00:02:45.170> that

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:45.290 
for the actual you know notes on that

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:47.350 
for the actual you know notes on that
but<00:02:45.440> a<00:02:45.560> 12<00:02:45.920> year<00:02:46.099> lifespan<00:02:46.579> on<00:02:46.790> the<00:02:47.000> on<00:02:47.180> the

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:47.360 
but a 12 year lifespan on the on the

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:48.729 
but a 12 year lifespan on the on the
fans<00:02:47.569> the<00:02:48.110> other<00:02:48.260> thing<00:02:48.379> that's<00:02:48.470> really<00:02:48.530> nice

00:02:48.729 --> 00:02:48.739 
fans the other thing that's really nice

00:02:48.739 --> 00:02:50.350 
fans the other thing that's really nice
is<00:02:48.950> there's<00:02:49.220> a<00:02:49.280> plate<00:02:49.579> on<00:02:49.610> this<00:02:49.970> and<00:02:50.120> the<00:02:50.180> plate

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:50.360 
is there's a plate on this and the plate

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:51.970 
is there's a plate on this and the plate
is<00:02:50.510> actually<00:02:50.599> on<00:02:50.870> the<00:02:50.959> front<00:02:51.200> of<00:02:51.260> the<00:02:51.349> PCB<00:02:51.829> it's

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:51.980 
is actually on the front of the PCB it's

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:53.650 
is actually on the front of the PCB it's
not<00:02:52.190> on<00:02:52.310> the<00:02:52.400> back<00:02:52.579> of<00:02:52.760> the<00:02:52.819> PCB<00:02:53.239> like<00:02:53.359> you<00:02:53.480> see

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:53.660 
not on the back of the PCB like you see

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:55.240 
not on the back of the PCB like you see
with<00:02:53.750> a<00:02:53.810> lot<00:02:53.959> of<00:02:53.989> graphics<00:02:54.319> cards<00:02:54.530> it<00:02:55.040> does

00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:55.250 
with a lot of graphics cards it does

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:56.619 
with a lot of graphics cards it does
actually<00:02:55.430> help<00:02:55.670> to<00:02:55.819> dissipate<00:02:56.209> some<00:02:56.420> heat

00:02:56.619 --> 00:02:56.629 
actually help to dissipate some heat

00:02:56.629 --> 00:02:58.390 
actually help to dissipate some heat
being<00:02:56.810> on<00:02:56.930> the<00:02:57.019> front<00:02:57.230> and<00:02:57.379> I<00:02:57.650> think<00:02:58.129> it<00:02:58.250> does<00:02:58.370> a

00:02:58.390 --> 00:02:58.400 
being on the front and I think it does a

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:00.130 
being on the front and I think it does a
little<00:02:58.549> better<00:02:58.760> than<00:02:58.970> you<00:02:59.540> know<00:02:59.840> the<00:02:59.959> ones

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:00.140 
little better than you know the ones

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:01.809 
little better than you know the ones
that<00:03:00.230> you<00:03:00.379> see<00:03:00.530> on<00:03:00.620> the<00:03:00.709> back<00:03:00.890> plus<00:03:01.519> it's<00:03:01.700> going

00:03:01.809 --> 00:03:01.819 
that you see on the back plus it's going

00:03:01.819 --> 00:03:03.309 
that you see on the back plus it's going
to<00:03:01.879> add<00:03:02.000> the<00:03:02.120> rigidity<00:03:02.390> to<00:03:02.690> the<00:03:02.780> card<00:03:03.019> you<00:03:03.230> know

00:03:03.309 --> 00:03:03.319 
to add the rigidity to the card you know

00:03:03.319 --> 00:03:04.420 
to add the rigidity to the card you know
because<00:03:03.530> these<00:03:03.620> things<00:03:03.739> are<00:03:03.890> big<00:03:04.129> and<00:03:04.340> they're

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:04.430 
because these things are big and they're

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:05.920 
because these things are big and they're
heavy<00:03:04.609> when<00:03:05.180> you<00:03:05.209> put<00:03:05.359> them<00:03:05.450> in<00:03:05.510> a<00:03:05.540> case<00:03:05.720> and

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:05.930 
heavy when you put them in a case and

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:07.990 
heavy when you put them in a case and
they're<00:03:06.019> mounted<00:03:06.530> this<00:03:06.680> way<00:03:06.829> just<00:03:07.670> holding

00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:08.000 
they're mounted this way just holding

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.630 
they're mounted this way just holding
the<00:03:08.090> box<00:03:08.299> here<00:03:08.540> mounted<00:03:09.109> this<00:03:09.230> way<00:03:09.459> you<00:03:10.459> do

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:10.640 
the box here mounted this way you do

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:12.550 
the box here mounted this way you do
want<00:03:10.910> something<00:03:11.329> to<00:03:11.599> stabilize<00:03:11.840> it<00:03:12.200> so<00:03:12.230> having

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:12.560 
want something to stabilize it so having

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:14.830 
want something to stabilize it so having
a<00:03:12.680> plate<00:03:13.370> in<00:03:13.519> there's<00:03:13.730> is<00:03:14.030> kind<00:03:14.450> of<00:03:14.510> nice<00:03:14.660> to

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:14.840 
a plate in there's is kind of nice to

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:16.420 
a plate in there's is kind of nice to
stabilize<00:03:15.230> the<00:03:15.379> PCB<00:03:15.859> now<00:03:16.129> let's<00:03:16.280> talk<00:03:16.370> about

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:16.430 
stabilize the PCB now let's talk about

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:18.069 
stabilize the PCB now let's talk about
the<00:03:16.640> blades<00:03:16.849> the<00:03:17.090> blades<00:03:17.329> on<00:03:17.480> the<00:03:17.569> actual<00:03:17.840> fan

00:03:18.069 --> 00:03:18.079 
the blades the blades on the actual fan

00:03:18.079 --> 00:03:20.170 
the blades the blades on the actual fan
are<00:03:18.230> 25%<00:03:18.620> lighter<00:03:19.069> so<00:03:19.849> that<00:03:19.970> means<00:03:20.090> they're

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:20.180 
are 25% lighter so that means they're

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:22.720 
are 25% lighter so that means they're
going<00:03:20.269> to<00:03:20.359> take<00:03:20.540> less<00:03:21.200> power<00:03:21.470> to<00:03:21.709> spin<00:03:21.950> which

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:22.730 
going to take less power to spin which

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:24.220 
going to take less power to spin which
is<00:03:22.760> kind<00:03:23.060> of<00:03:23.090> nice<00:03:23.209> I<00:03:23.389> mean<00:03:23.510> not<00:03:23.660> much<00:03:23.780> less<00:03:24.049> but

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:24.230 
is kind of nice I mean not much less but

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:26.319 
is kind of nice I mean not much less but
a<00:03:24.380> little<00:03:24.620> bit<00:03:24.769> less<00:03:24.919> and<00:03:25.340> they<00:03:25.819> are<00:03:25.940> 700

00:03:26.319 --> 00:03:26.329 
a little bit less and they are 700

00:03:26.329 --> 00:03:29.190 
a little bit less and they are 700
percent<00:03:26.750> stronger<00:03:27.139> so<00:03:27.680> lighter<00:03:28.340> and<00:03:28.609> stronger

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:29.200 
percent stronger so lighter and stronger

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:32.470 
percent stronger so lighter and stronger
hey<00:03:30.200> why<00:03:30.440> not<00:03:30.470> other<00:03:31.340> than<00:03:31.519> that<00:03:31.669> what<00:03:31.880> EVGA

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:32.480 
hey why not other than that what EVGA

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:34.390 
hey why not other than that what EVGA
has<00:03:32.630> done<00:03:32.810> is<00:03:32.959> they've<00:03:33.109> upped<00:03:33.440> the<00:03:33.799> the<00:03:34.250> core

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:34.400 
has done is they've upped the the core

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:36.129 
has done is they've upped the the core
clock<00:03:34.609> to<00:03:34.760> 980<00:03:35.150> and<00:03:35.450> the<00:03:35.540> boost<00:03:35.720> clock<00:03:35.900> goes

00:03:36.129 --> 00:03:36.139 
clock to 980 and the boost clock goes

00:03:36.139 --> 00:03:38.979 
clock to 980 and the boost clock goes
all<00:03:36.290> the<00:03:36.319> way<00:03:36.440> up<00:03:36.560> to<00:03:36.709> 1046<00:03:37.430> and<00:03:37.639> thanks<00:03:38.540> to<00:03:38.660> GPU

00:03:38.979 --> 00:03:38.989

boost<00:03:39.139> 2.0<00:03:39.530> it's<00:03:39.709> going<00:03:39.829> to<00:03:39.889> get<00:03:40.010> way<00:03:40.190> higher

00:03:40.210 --> 00:03:40.220 
boost 2.0 it's going to get way higher

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:42.309 
boost 2.0 it's going to get way higher
than<00:03:40.609> that<00:03:40.730> and<00:03:40.970> I<00:03:41.209> also<00:03:41.510> Logan<00:03:41.870> Clark<00:03:42.079> Oh<00:03:42.169> Dino

you<00:03:48.680> know<00:03:48.799> how<00:03:48.950> this<00:03:49.069> thing<00:03:49.130> is<00:03:49.310> running<00:03:49.519> in<00:03:49.700> my

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:49.790 
you know how this thing is running in my

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:51.610 
you know how this thing is running in my
system<00:03:50.120> but<00:03:50.209> I<00:03:50.239> was<00:03:50.569> able<00:03:50.660> to<00:03:50.780> push<00:03:50.930> it<00:03:50.959> to<00:03:51.139> 1055

00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:51.620

and<00:03:52.099> beyond<00:03:52.849> 1100<00:03:53.599> in<00:03:53.690> some<00:03:53.900> games<00:03:54.139> so<00:03:54.380> I'm

00:03:54.550 --> 00:03:54.560 
and beyond 1100 in some games so I'm

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:55.720 
and beyond 1100 in some games so I'm
still<00:03:54.769> playing<00:03:54.980> around<00:03:55.250> with<00:03:55.400> it<00:03:55.459> I'm<00:03:55.609> not

00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:55.730 
still playing around with it I'm not

00:03:55.730 --> 00:03:56.949 
still playing around with it I'm not
quite<00:03:55.970> ready<00:03:56.000> to<00:03:56.269> make<00:03:56.389> an<00:03:56.510> overclocking

00:03:56.949 --> 00:03:56.959 
quite ready to make an overclocking

00:03:56.959 --> 00:03:58.300 
quite ready to make an overclocking
video<00:03:57.169> yet<00:03:57.470> but<00:03:57.650> we'll<00:03:57.769> get<00:03:57.919> there

00:03:58.300 --> 00:03:58.310 
video yet but we'll get there

00:03:58.310 --> 00:04:00.009 
video yet but we'll get there
now<00:03:58.489> let's<00:03:58.639> talk<00:03:58.730> about<00:03:58.790> the<00:03:59.030> general<00:03:59.150> 780ti

00:04:00.009 --> 00:04:00.019 
now let's talk about the general 780ti

00:04:00.019 --> 00:04:02.440 
now let's talk about the general 780ti
specs<00:04:00.440> we<00:04:00.590> have<00:04:00.669> 2880<00:04:01.669> cuda<00:04:02.000> cores<00:04:02.030> that's

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:02.450 
specs we have 2880 cuda cores that's

00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:04.780 
specs we have 2880 cuda cores that's
more<00:04:02.660> than<00:04:02.810> the<00:04:02.900> titan<00:04:03.260> that's<00:04:03.470> more<00:04:03.739> than<00:04:03.919> the

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:04.790 
more than the titan that's more than the

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:07.449 
more than the titan that's more than the
780<00:04:05.299> so<00:04:05.780> it's<00:04:06.019> a<00:04:06.109> step<00:04:06.319> up<00:04:06.500> there<00:04:06.769> the<00:04:07.190> memory

00:04:07.449 --> 00:04:07.459 
780 so it's a step up there the memory

00:04:07.459 --> 00:04:09.640 
780 so it's a step up there the memory
on<00:04:07.489> this<00:04:07.730> we<00:04:07.849> have<00:04:08.150> three<00:04:08.569> gigabytes<00:04:09.019> of<00:04:09.230> gddr5

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:09.650 
on this we have three gigabytes of gddr5

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:11.530 
on this we have three gigabytes of gddr5
I<00:04:10.430> thought<00:04:10.760> we<00:04:10.879> were<00:04:10.970> finally<00:04:11.150> going<00:04:11.359> to<00:04:11.419> see

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:11.540 
I thought we were finally going to see

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:12.759 
I thought we were finally going to see
four<00:04:11.780> because<00:04:11.989> we're<00:04:12.109> seeing<00:04:12.199> a<00:04:12.349> four<00:04:12.530> on<00:04:12.560> the

00:04:12.759 --> 00:04:12.769 
four because we're seeing a four on the

00:04:12.769 --> 00:04:15.159 
four because we're seeing a four on the
AMD<00:04:13.010> stuff<00:04:13.280> and<00:04:13.370> we<00:04:13.430> have<00:04:13.549> six<00:04:13.819> on<00:04:13.970> the<00:04:14.810> the

00:04:15.159 --> 00:04:15.169 
AMD stuff and we have six on the the

00:04:15.169 --> 00:04:17.319 
AMD stuff and we have six on the the
Titan<00:04:15.530> but<00:04:15.650> no<00:04:15.799> we<00:04:15.949> have<00:04:16.070> we<00:04:16.609> have<00:04:16.699> three<00:04:16.940> still

00:04:17.319 --> 00:04:17.329 
Titan but no we have we have three still

00:04:17.329 --> 00:04:20.140 
Titan but no we have we have three still
but<00:04:17.810> that<00:04:18.139> three<00:04:18.500> it's<00:04:19.370> really<00:04:19.639> fast<00:04:19.910> it's

00:04:20.140 --> 00:04:20.150 
but that three it's really fast it's

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:23.529 
but that three it's really fast it's
still<00:04:20.479> using<00:04:20.750> the<00:04:20.840> same<00:04:20.870> 384<00:04:21.680> bit<00:04:21.890> memory<00:04:22.669> bus

00:04:23.529 --> 00:04:23.539 
still using the same 384 bit memory bus

00:04:23.539 --> 00:04:24.969 
still using the same 384 bit memory bus
with<00:04:23.719> that<00:04:23.750> we'd<00:04:23.960> see<00:04:24.169> on<00:04:24.349> the<00:04:24.500> you<00:04:24.890> know<00:04:24.950> the

00:04:24.969 --> 00:04:24.979 
with that we'd see on the you know the

00:04:24.979 --> 00:04:27.400 
with that we'd see on the you know the
Titan<00:04:25.340> and<00:04:25.430> the<00:04:25.580> 780<00:04:25.969> but<00:04:26.659> the<00:04:26.840> the

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:27.410 
Titan and the 780 but the the

00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:31.750 
Titan and the 780 but the the
clock<00:04:28.100> on<00:04:28.370> this<00:04:28.640> is<00:04:28.840> 7000<00:04:29.840> megahertz<00:04:30.490> so<00:04:31.490> the

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:31.760 
clock on this is 7000 megahertz so the

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:35.290 
clock on this is 7000 megahertz so the
bandwidth<00:04:32.390> is<00:04:33.160> 336<00:04:34.160> gigabytes<00:04:34.610> per<00:04:34.730> second

00:04:35.290 --> 00:04:35.300 
bandwidth is 336 gigabytes per second

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:38.200 
bandwidth is 336 gigabytes per second
that<00:04:35.600> is<00:04:35.720> more<00:04:35.960> than<00:04:36.080> any<00:04:36.970> graphics<00:04:37.970> card<00:04:38.150> on

00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:38.210 
that is more than any graphics card on

00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:40.120 
that is more than any graphics card on
the<00:04:38.270> market<00:04:38.540> that's<00:04:38.740> pretty<00:04:39.740> ridiculous

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:40.130 
the market that's pretty ridiculous

00:04:40.130 --> 00:04:41.770 
the market that's pretty ridiculous
right<00:04:40.580> above<00:04:40.730> and<00:04:40.910> beyond<00:04:41.120> like<00:04:41.300> the<00:04:41.420> graphics

00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:41.780 
right above and beyond like the graphics

00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:43.540 
right above and beyond like the graphics
card<00:04:41.990> NVIDIA<00:04:42.650> has<00:04:42.710> really<00:04:43.040> been<00:04:43.190> talking<00:04:43.370> a

00:04:43.540 --> 00:04:43.550 
card NVIDIA has really been talking a

00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:45.520 
card NVIDIA has really been talking a
lot<00:04:43.700> about<00:04:43.940> just<00:04:44.180> just<00:04:44.810> I<00:04:44.960> mean<00:04:45.260> what<00:04:45.410> they've

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:45.530 
lot about just just I mean what they've

00:04:45.530 --> 00:04:47.650 
lot about just just I mean what they've
been<00:04:45.620> doing<00:04:45.770> outside<00:04:46.400> of<00:04:46.790> creating<00:04:47.300> graphics

00:04:47.650 --> 00:04:47.660 
been doing outside of creating graphics

00:04:47.660 --> 00:04:49.030 
been doing outside of creating graphics
cards<00:04:47.930> stuff<00:04:48.230> like<00:04:48.380> there<00:04:48.530> are<00:04:48.680> game<00:04:48.830> works

00:04:49.030 --> 00:04:49.040 
cards stuff like there are game works

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:50.380 
cards stuff like there are game works
initiative<00:04:49.490> and<00:04:49.640> what<00:04:49.730> that<00:04:49.850> is<00:04:50.000> they've<00:04:50.210> got

00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:50.390 
initiative and what that is they've got

00:04:50.390 --> 00:04:53.290 
initiative and what that is they've got
300<00:04:50.630> guys<00:04:50.990> they're<00:04:51.320> like<00:04:51.530> really<00:04:52.300> freaking

00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:25.970 
is there an Nvidia logo in the beginning

did<00:05:26.990> you<00:05:27.110> pay<00:05:27.500> to<00:05:28.130> get<00:05:28.280> those<00:05:28.430> logos<00:05:28.610> in<00:05:28.820> there

00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:28.910 
did you pay to get those logos in there

00:05:28.910 --> 00:05:30.220 
did you pay to get those logos in there
he<00:05:29.000> goes<00:05:29.120> we<00:05:29.240> don't<00:05:29.390> pay<00:05:29.510> we<00:05:29.660> just<00:05:29.840> send<00:05:30.050> people

he goes we don't pay we just send people
to<00:05:30.380> help<00:05:30.620> and<00:05:30.920> that's<00:05:31.280> the<00:05:31.430> way<00:05:31.490> they<00:05:31.580> think

00:05:31.630 --> 00:05:31.640 
to help and that's the way they think

00:05:31.640 --> 00:05:33.520 
to help and that's the way they think
it's<00:05:31.910> by<00:05:32.000> putting<00:05:32.240> in<00:05:32.330> a<00:05:32.390> video<00:05:32.630> logo<00:05:32.930> and<00:05:33.260> you

00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:33.530 
it's by putting in a video logo and you

00:05:33.530 --> 00:05:34.990 
it's by putting in a video logo and you
know<00:05:33.620> the<00:05:33.740> beginning<00:05:34.010> of<00:05:34.100> the<00:05:34.160> game<00:05:34.310> on<00:05:34.670> top<00:05:34.850> of

00:05:34.990 --> 00:05:35.000 
know the beginning of the game on top of

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:36.010 
know the beginning of the game on top of
all<00:05:35.090> that<00:05:35.120> we<00:05:35.330> have<00:05:35.450> the<00:05:35.540> GeForce<00:05:35.870> experience

all that we have the GeForce experience

00:05:36.020 --> 00:05:39.730 
all that we have the GeForce experience
and<00:05:36.820> shadow<00:05:37.820> play<00:05:38.150> is<00:05:38.480> about<00:05:38.930> here<00:05:39.410> we<00:05:39.590> also

00:05:39.730 --> 00:05:39.740 
and shadow play is about here we also

00:05:39.740 --> 00:05:41.290 
and shadow play is about here we also
have<00:05:39.830> gsync<00:05:40.280> and<00:05:40.460> that's<00:05:40.640> all<00:05:40.820> stuff<00:05:41.090> that's

00:05:41.290 --> 00:05:41.300 
have gsync and that's all stuff that's

00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:43.570 
have gsync and that's all stuff that's
like<00:05:41.420> about<00:05:42.140> to<00:05:42.470> be<00:05:42.530> released<00:05:42.919> onto<00:05:43.370> the

00:05:43.570 --> 00:05:43.580 
like about to be released onto the

00:05:43.580 --> 00:05:45.640 
like about to be released onto the
public<00:05:43.970> do<00:05:44.060> you<00:05:44.120> think<00:05:44.300> as<00:05:44.390> a<00:05:44.419> dynamic<00:05:44.750> refresh

00:05:45.640 --> 00:05:45.650 
public do you think as a dynamic refresh

00:05:45.650 --> 00:05:48.220 
public do you think as a dynamic refresh
rate<00:05:45.890> that<00:05:46.340> is<00:05:46.550> not<00:05:46.760> based<00:05:47.030> upon<00:05:47.240> the<00:05:47.480> the

00:05:48.220 --> 00:05:48.230 
rate that is not based upon the the

00:05:48.230 --> 00:05:49.810 
rate that is not based upon the the
response<00:05:48.590> rate<00:05:48.830> on<00:05:48.980> your<00:05:49.010> monitor<00:05:49.520> so<00:05:49.669> if<00:05:49.730> you

00:05:49.810 --> 00:05:49.820 
response rate on your monitor so if you

00:05:49.820 --> 00:05:51.909 
response rate on your monitor so if you
have<00:05:49.910> a<00:05:49.940> 60<00:05:50.330> Hertz<00:05:50.480> monitor<00:05:50.720> but<00:05:51.470> your<00:05:51.620> game<00:05:51.770> is

00:05:51.909 --> 00:05:51.919 
have a 60 Hertz monitor but your game is

00:05:51.919 --> 00:05:53.740 
have a 60 Hertz monitor but your game is
capable<00:05:52.040> of<00:05:52.460> running<00:05:52.610> at<00:05:52.820> 200<00:05:53.360> frames<00:05:53.600> per

00:05:53.740 --> 00:05:53.750 
capable of running at 200 frames per

00:05:53.750 --> 00:05:56.230 
capable of running at 200 frames per
second<00:05:54.140> well<00:05:54.530> g-sync<00:05:54.980> will<00:05:55.820> get<00:05:55.970> rid<00:05:56.090> of<00:05:56.120> the

00:05:56.230 --> 00:05:56.240 
second well g-sync will get rid of the

00:05:56.240 --> 00:05:58.510 
second well g-sync will get rid of the
tearing<00:05:56.570> and<00:05:56.720> allow<00:05:57.650> it<00:05:57.740> to<00:05:57.860> run<00:05:57.980> at<00:05:58.160> a<00:05:58.280> higher

00:05:58.510 --> 00:05:58.520 
tearing and allow it to run at a higher

00:05:58.520 --> 00:06:00.220 
tearing and allow it to run at a higher
framerate<00:05:58.880> than<00:05:59.210> 60<00:05:59.480> frames<00:05:59.720> per<00:05:59.870> second<00:06:00.200> so

00:06:00.220 --> 00:06:00.230 
framerate than 60 frames per second so

00:06:00.230 --> 00:06:01.450 
framerate than 60 frames per second so
that's<00:06:00.470> pretty<00:06:00.650> cool<00:06:00.800> technology<00:06:00.919> that's

00:06:01.450 --> 00:06:01.460 
that's pretty cool technology that's

00:06:01.460 --> 00:06:02.320 
that's pretty cool technology that's
coming<00:06:01.640> out<00:06:01.730> soon<00:06:01.760> and<00:06:02.000> we'll<00:06:02.090> talk<00:06:02.210> about

00:06:02.320 --> 00:06:02.330 
coming out soon and we'll talk about

00:06:02.330 --> 00:06:04.120 
coming out soon and we'll talk about
that<00:06:02.480> when<00:06:02.750> it<00:06:02.840> gets<00:06:02.990> out<00:06:03.110> and<00:06:03.740> then<00:06:03.860> we<00:06:03.980> also

00:06:04.120 --> 00:06:04.130 
that when it gets out and then we also

00:06:04.130 --> 00:06:05.800 
that when it gets out and then we also
have<00:06:04.370> shadow<00:06:04.610> play<00:06:04.850> shadow<00:06:05.270> play<00:06:05.510> is<00:06:05.660> probably

00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:05.810 
have shadow play shadow play is probably

00:06:05.810 --> 00:06:08.530 
have shadow play shadow play is probably
going<00:06:06.140> to<00:06:06.200> replace<00:06:06.410> fraps<00:06:06.770> and<00:06:07.150> it<00:06:08.150> also<00:06:08.300> is

00:06:08.530 --> 00:06:08.540 
going to replace fraps and it also is

00:06:08.540 --> 00:06:09.880 
going to replace fraps and it also is
going<00:06:08.630> to<00:06:08.780> use<00:06:08.900> some<00:06:09.050> technology<00:06:09.560> on<00:06:09.740> the

00:06:09.880 --> 00:06:09.890 
going to use some technology on the

00:06:09.890 --> 00:06:12.010 
going to use some technology on the
graphics<00:06:10.250> card<00:06:10.310> to<00:06:10.550> accelerate<00:06:11.090> it<00:06:11.210> so<00:06:11.810> that

00:06:12.010 --> 00:06:12.020 
graphics card to accelerate it so that

00:06:12.020 --> 00:06:12.820 
graphics card to accelerate it so that
it's<00:06:12.140> not<00:06:12.200> going<00:06:12.260> to<00:06:12.410> slow<00:06:12.590> down<00:06:12.620> your

00:06:12.820 --> 00:06:12.830 
it's not going to slow down your

00:06:12.830 --> 00:06:15.970 
it's not going to slow down your
gameplay<00:06:13.370> as<00:06:13.580> much<00:06:13.790> as<00:06:13.940> fraps<00:06:14.240> so<00:06:14.980> smaller

00:06:15.970 --> 00:06:15.980 
gameplay as much as fraps so smaller

00:06:15.980 --> 00:06:19.960 
gameplay as much as fraps so smaller
file<00:06:16.220> sizes<00:06:17.350> faster<00:06:18.350> performance<00:06:18.470> and<00:06:19.040> it's

00:06:19.960 --> 00:06:19.970 
file sizes faster performance and it's

00:06:19.970 --> 00:06:21.159 
file sizes faster performance and it's
just<00:06:20.090> going<00:06:20.330> to<00:06:20.419> be<00:06:20.510> like<00:06:20.630> probably<00:06:20.840> the<00:06:21.050> new

00:06:21.159 --> 00:06:21.169 
just going to be like probably the new

00:06:21.169 --> 00:06:22.710 
just going to be like probably the new
way<00:06:21.320> that<00:06:21.350> everyone's<00:06:21.800> going<00:06:22.010> to<00:06:22.070> be

00:06:22.710 --> 00:06:22.720 
way that everyone's going to be

00:06:22.720 --> 00:06:24.940 
way that everyone's going to be
recording<00:06:23.720> their<00:06:23.840> games<00:06:24.050> especially<00:06:24.590> if<00:06:24.650> um

00:06:24.940 --> 00:06:24.950 
recording their games especially if um

00:06:24.950 --> 00:06:26.650 
recording their games especially if um
you<00:06:25.040> know<00:06:25.100> if<00:06:25.190> you<00:06:25.250> have<00:06:25.340> an<00:06:25.400> individual<00:06:25.760> card

00:06:26.650 --> 00:06:26.660 
you know if you have an individual card

00:06:26.660 --> 00:06:28.210 
you know if you have an individual card
so<00:06:26.780> I<00:06:27.020> haven't<00:06:27.440> played<00:06:27.560> with<00:06:27.680> that<00:06:27.740> yet<00:06:27.980> either

00:06:28.210 --> 00:06:28.220 
so I haven't played with that yet either

00:06:28.220 --> 00:06:30.520 
so I haven't played with that yet either
what<00:06:29.120> I<00:06:29.150> have<00:06:29.360> done<00:06:29.540> is<00:06:29.780> I've<00:06:29.930> benchmarked

00:06:30.520 --> 00:06:30.530 
what I have done is I've benchmarked

00:06:30.530 --> 00:06:32.320 
what I have done is I've benchmarked
this<00:06:30.680> and<00:06:30.919> I've<00:06:31.070> overclocked<00:06:31.490> this<00:06:31.700> and<00:06:31.910> I've

00:06:32.320 --> 00:06:32.330 
this and I've overclocked this and I've

00:06:32.330 --> 00:06:35.260 
this and I've overclocked this and I've
tested<00:06:32.690> it<00:06:32.750> against<00:06:33.230> the<00:06:33.530> 780<00:06:34.100> so<00:06:34.820> what<00:06:35.180> we're

00:06:35.260 --> 00:06:35.270 
tested it against the 780 so what we're

00:06:35.270 --> 00:06:36.340 
tested it against the 780 so what we're
going<00:06:35.390> to<00:06:35.419> do<00:06:35.510> in<00:06:35.600> the<00:06:35.690> second<00:06:35.960> video<00:06:36.140> is<00:06:36.260> I'm

00:06:36.340 --> 00:06:36.350 
going to do in the second video is I'm

00:06:36.350 --> 00:06:38.230 
going to do in the second video is I'm
going<00:06:36.470> to<00:06:36.530> put<00:06:36.620> this<00:06:36.680> into<00:06:36.830> my<00:06:36.919> system<00:06:37.280> and<00:06:37.970> I'm

00:06:38.230 --> 00:06:38.240 
going to put this into my system and I'm

00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:40.360 
going to put this into my system and I'm
going<00:06:38.360> to<00:06:38.390> test<00:06:38.570> this<00:06:38.750> against<00:06:39.620> the<00:06:39.710> 780<00:06:40.070> I'm

00:06:40.360 --> 00:06:40.370 
going to test this against the 780 I'm

00:06:40.370 --> 00:06:40.790 
going to test this against the 780 I'm
going

00:06:40.790 --> 00:06:40.800 
going

00:06:40.800 --> 00:06:44.029 
going
test<00:06:41.069> this<00:06:41.780> against<00:06:42.780> itself<00:06:43.080> overclocked<00:06:43.710> and

00:06:44.029 --> 00:06:44.039 
test this against itself overclocked and

00:06:44.039 --> 00:06:46.219 
test this against itself overclocked and
show<00:06:44.610> you<00:06:44.669> guys<00:06:44.789> the<00:06:44.940> results<00:06:45.180> and<00:06:45.810> I<00:06:46.020> think

00:06:46.219 --> 00:06:46.229 
show you guys the results and I think

00:06:46.229 --> 00:06:48.740 
show you guys the results and I think
you'll<00:06:46.319> be<00:06:46.409> surprised<00:06:46.830> because<00:06:47.069> I<00:06:47.629> did<00:06:48.629> not

00:06:48.740 --> 00:06:48.750 
you'll be surprised because I did not

00:06:48.750 --> 00:06:50.240 
you'll be surprised because I did not
expect<00:06:48.810> it<00:06:49.199> to<00:06:49.319> be<00:06:49.440> this<00:06:49.590> much<00:06:49.770> faster<00:06:49.979> than

00:06:50.240 --> 00:06:50.250 
expect it to be this much faster than

00:06:50.250 --> 00:06:52.070 
expect it to be this much faster than
780<00:06:50.729> but<00:06:50.940> it<00:06:51.060> is<00:06:51.180> quite<00:06:51.449> a<00:06:51.479> bit<00:06:51.659> faster<00:06:51.810> than

00:06:52.070 --> 00:06:52.080 
780 but it is quite a bit faster than

00:06:52.080 --> 00:06:54.170 
780 but it is quite a bit faster than
780<00:06:52.530> I<00:06:52.770> also<00:06:53.250> want<00:06:53.490> to<00:06:53.520> note<00:06:53.669> that<00:06:53.699> I'm<00:06:53.940> running

00:06:54.170 --> 00:06:54.180 
780 I also want to note that I'm running

00:06:54.180 --> 00:06:56.119 
780 I also want to note that I'm running
the<00:06:54.449> ridiculous<00:06:55.169> version<00:06:55.500> of<00:06:55.590> Skyrim<00:06:55.949> right

00:06:56.119 --> 00:06:56.129 
the ridiculous version of Skyrim right

00:06:56.129 --> 00:06:58.309 
the ridiculous version of Skyrim right
now<00:06:56.250> and<00:06:56.400> I<00:06:56.430> stream<00:06:56.789> Skyrim<00:06:57.210> and<00:06:57.330> it's<00:06:58.080> been

00:06:58.309 --> 00:06:58.319 
now and I stream Skyrim and it's been

00:06:58.319 --> 00:07:00.529 
now and I stream Skyrim and it's been
crashing<00:06:58.770> all<00:06:59.009> the<00:06:59.340> time<00:06:59.580> I<00:06:59.819> didn't<00:07:00.150> I<00:07:00.240> don't

00:07:00.529 --> 00:07:00.539 
crashing all the time I didn't I don't

00:07:00.539 --> 00:07:02.450 
crashing all the time I didn't I don't
think<00:07:00.690> my<00:07:00.810> 780<00:07:01.169> could<00:07:01.349> handle<00:07:01.560> it<00:07:01.650> so<00:07:01.830> I<00:07:02.039> put

00:07:02.450 --> 00:07:02.460 
think my 780 could handle it so I put

00:07:02.460 --> 00:07:04.790 
think my 780 could handle it so I put
this<00:07:02.610> in<00:07:02.669> and<00:07:03.060> I<00:07:03.569> played<00:07:03.810> for<00:07:04.409> several<00:07:04.620> hours

00:07:04.790 --> 00:07:04.800 
this in and I played for several hours

00:07:04.800 --> 00:07:07.640 
this in and I played for several hours
in<00:07:05.009> a<00:07:05.159> crash<00:07:05.370> once<00:07:05.819> and<00:07:06.150> that's<00:07:06.750> compared<00:07:07.590> to

00:07:07.640 --> 00:07:07.650 
in a crash once and that's compared to

00:07:07.650 --> 00:07:09.290 
in a crash once and that's compared to
like<00:07:07.800> usually<00:07:08.129> crashing<00:07:08.520> every<00:07:08.639> five<00:07:08.940> minutes

00:07:09.290 --> 00:07:09.300 
like usually crashing every five minutes

00:07:09.300 --> 00:07:11.930 
like usually crashing every five minutes
or<00:07:09.419> whatever<00:07:09.659> before<00:07:09.840> so<00:07:10.909> something<00:07:11.909> that's

00:07:11.930 --> 00:07:11.940 
or whatever before so something that's

00:07:11.940 --> 00:07:13.879 
or whatever before so something that's
going<00:07:12.210> on<00:07:12.360> here<00:07:12.659> is<00:07:12.780> making<00:07:12.960> my<00:07:13.199> Skyrim<00:07:13.650> a<00:07:13.680> lot

00:07:13.879 --> 00:07:13.889 
going on here is making my Skyrim a lot

00:07:13.889 --> 00:07:15.740 
going on here is making my Skyrim a lot
happier<00:07:14.190> I<00:07:14.340> think<00:07:14.699> if<00:07:14.789> my<00:07:14.909> graphics<00:07:15.449> card<00:07:15.479> just

00:07:15.740 --> 00:07:15.750 
happier I think if my graphics card just

00:07:15.750 --> 00:07:17.180 
happier I think if my graphics card just
couldn't<00:07:15.960> handle<00:07:16.080> it<00:07:16.259> before<00:07:16.620> and<00:07:16.800> now<00:07:16.889> I<00:07:16.919> can

00:07:17.180 --> 00:07:17.190 
couldn't handle it before and now I can

00:07:17.190 --> 00:07:19.010 
couldn't handle it before and now I can
so<00:07:17.490> I<00:07:17.699> imagine<00:07:18.449> most<00:07:18.509> you<00:07:18.690> guys<00:07:18.810> are<00:07:18.960> not

00:07:19.010 --> 00:07:19.020 
so I imagine most you guys are not

00:07:19.020 --> 00:07:22.240 
so I imagine most you guys are not
running<00:07:19.530> a<00:07:19.650> game<00:07:19.800> like<00:07:20.009> that<00:07:20.069> but<00:07:20.639> if<00:07:21.060> you<00:07:21.270> are

00:07:22.240 --> 00:07:22.250 
running a game like that but if you are

00:07:22.250 --> 00:07:24.950 
running a game like that but if you are
this<00:07:23.250> could<00:07:23.460> help<00:07:23.580> so<00:07:24.449> go<00:07:24.539> ahead<00:07:24.599> and<00:07:24.690> click<00:07:24.870> on

00:07:24.950 --> 00:07:24.960 
this could help so go ahead and click on

00:07:24.960 --> 00:07:26.540 
this could help so go ahead and click on
the<00:07:25.080> screen<00:07:25.319> to<00:07:25.349> check<00:07:25.560> out<00:07:25.680> the<00:07:25.770> second<00:07:26.069> half

00:07:26.540 --> 00:07:26.550 
the screen to check out the second half

00:07:26.550 --> 00:07:27.770 
the screen to check out the second half
of<00:07:26.789> this<00:07:26.849> video<00:07:27.030> so<00:07:27.360> you<00:07:27.419> can<00:07:27.539> see<00:07:27.599> the

00:07:27.770 --> 00:07:27.780 
of this video so you can see the

00:07:27.780 --> 00:07:29.809 
of this video so you can see the
benchmarks<00:07:28.229> and<00:07:28.680> just<00:07:29.280> you<00:07:29.430> know<00:07:29.550> get<00:07:29.699> some

00:07:29.809 --> 00:07:29.819 
benchmarks and just you know get some

00:07:29.819 --> 00:07:32.029 
benchmarks and just you know get some
more<00:07:29.969> of<00:07:30.030> my<00:07:30.120> general<00:07:30.479> ideas<00:07:30.870> maybe<00:07:31.530> also<00:07:31.740> some

00:07:32.029 --> 00:07:32.039 
more of my general ideas maybe also some
