00:00:05.350 --> 00:00:09.800
 a classics runner they have to 

00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:11.389
 luck they have two seasons in one 

00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:13.190
 only eventually they have the beginning of 

00:00:11.389 --> 00:00:16.970
 spring season and we also see 

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:20.060
 set that goal set the end 

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:22.399
 of season with the classics of 

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:24.500
 autumn and I believe the grand prize 

00:00:22.399 --> 00:00:25.669
 of quebec and grand prix of montreal on 

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:27.710
 two races that you like well marc 

00:00:25.669 --> 00:00:30.579
 way these two races that are 

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:34.010
 attractive with selective circuits 

00:00:30.579 --> 00:00:35.780
 or in general we have a nice race of 

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:39.950
 movement each at each edition 

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:41.570
 so it's races where we hope 

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:44.060
 to look for results with 

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:46.870
 federation of pinots pichot damage 

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:50.120
 do like that they have the abilities 

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:51.079
 to achieve good performance on 

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:52.730
 this type of course 

00:00:51.079 --> 00:00:57.230
 did the runners welcome 

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:59.270
 pretty much these new proofs goes that 

00:00:57.230 --> 00:00:59.870
 thoughts they agree then no 

00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:02.030
 but precisely 

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:03.950
 yes that's my choice no I think 

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:07.330
 than today races like quebec 

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:07.330
 montreal have returned 

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:12.850
 in the mores of cyclists 

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:14.409
 French people often say that 

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:17.590
 Quebecers are a bit like the cousins â€‹â€‹of 

00:01:14.409 --> 00:01:19.690
 French and what there is a cousin 

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:22.000
 also that one could establish 

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:24.580
 between the two races these two events 

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.810
 Canadian and events such as 

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:28.750
 used to find them in France 

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:30.070
 oh yes a kinship already high 

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:32.380
 level of organization there for example 

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:34.240
 charly mottet who participate so 

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:34.890
 important to the establishment of these 

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:37.600
 hardship 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:39.850
 on the other side of the atlantic so do not 

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:40.240
 would that be by his touch and his 

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:43.690
 paw 

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:45.670
 we feel that there is a filiation but 

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:48.300
 beyond that it's races that 

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:52.060
 are hilly on paths 

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:55.300
 attractive with difficulties 

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:56.800
 interesting ones that allow one there too 

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:58.240
 a lot of the power pack 

00:01:56.800 --> 00:02:02.830
 to express it gives races 

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:05.350
 animated and we find 

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:09.009
 nice scenario to watch on TV 

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:11.680
 but finally you told us you 

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:13.630
 and many of your colleagues that bike 

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:16.150
 is not like formula 1 we can not 

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:17.220
 afford to send runners to 

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:20.410
 around the world 

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:23.620
 set goals for them 

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:24.820
 on these different tests but we 

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:26.530
 still sees this calendar 

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:29.110
 international settled year 

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:31.600
 after year and your runners they go in 

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:32.890
 australia voka late they did not want 

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:34.450
 not just households in canada and 

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:38.050
 so sorry it's not necessarily the 

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:39.520
 same time every time meant that a 

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:41.260
 current does not go around the world at 

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:41.590
 course of the year coming thankfully 

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:44.020
 anyway 

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:45.790
 that's why it's too much is the 

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:46.720
 is part of canada coming back for 

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:48.640
 make the world championship 

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:52.030
 is it easy enough? 

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:54.940
 we 're going to see we'll see this 

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:56.260
 year now is it when 

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:58.060
 even quite difficult and I think the 

00:02:56.260 --> 00:03:00.820
 corals that will have toured spain 

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:02.620
 whole world and it looks like on the 

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:05.320
 world wide but on the other hand a lot of 

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:07.390
 runners today who claim to the 

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:10.270
 victory at the world championships 

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:12.610
 go through canada wen to the media 

00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:13.690
 when finally the specificity that 

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:14.710
 I mean to the possible routes 

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:17.140
 yes there are several possible routes 

00:03:14.710 --> 00:03:20.170
 but but the path that is getting closer 

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:22.240
 most of the course of florence it is 

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:23.830
 probably more in Canada than on 

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:26.200
 a bolt played but the vuelta it allows 

00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:28.030
 to have a physical fitness at the top 

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:30.940
 with a three-week run 

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:32.230
 Montreal is a day so it's 

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:33.340
 different one must already have the 

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:34.660
 physical condition before going to 

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:36.870
 Montreal otherwise it's not there fight 

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:36.870
 the state
