up and ruining your computer because it

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:43.940 
up and ruining your computer because it
is<00:00:40.610> pretty<00:00:41.610> reliable<00:00:42.329> I'd<00:00:42.480> say<00:00:42.840> how<00:00:43.649> about<00:00:43.800> how

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:43.950 
is pretty reliable I'd say how about how

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:46.100 
is pretty reliable I'd say how about how
far<00:00:44.160> can<00:00:44.250> I<00:00:44.340> take<00:00:44.520> this<00:00:44.670> I<00:00:44.910> mean<00:00:45.750> I'm<00:00:45.870> pulling

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.110 
far can I take this I mean I'm pulling

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:48.049 
far can I take this I mean I'm pulling
this<00:00:46.170> thing<00:00:46.230> pretty<00:00:47.219> hard<00:00:47.430> and<00:00:47.730> it's<00:00:47.879> not

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059 
this thing pretty hard and it's not

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:49.779 
this thing pretty hard and it's not
coming<00:00:48.239> off<00:00:48.390> because<00:00:48.660> it's<00:00:48.750> really<00:00:48.960> strong<00:00:49.350> so

00:00:49.779 --> 00:00:49.789 
coming off because it's really strong so

00:00:49.789 --> 00:00:52.540 
coming off because it's really strong so
basically<00:00:50.789> what<00:00:50.940> you<00:00:51.000> see<00:00:51.210> here<00:00:51.420> is<00:00:51.570> a

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:52.550 
basically what you see here is a

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:55.160 
basically what you see here is a
radiator<00:00:53.550> it<00:00:53.760> is<00:00:54.000> a<00:00:54.030> 1<00:00:54.270> by<00:00:54.390> 1<00:00:54.420> 20<00:00:54.660> millimeter

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170 
radiator it is a 1 by 1 20 millimeter

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:58.279 
radiator it is a 1 by 1 20 millimeter
radiator<00:00:55.469> and<00:00:56.190> it<00:00:56.340> does<00:00:56.489> come<00:00:56.760> with<00:00:57.079> a<00:00:58.079> fan

00:00:58.279 --> 00:00:58.289 
radiator and it does come with a fan

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:00.650 
radiator and it does come with a fan
right<00:00:58.859> here's<00:00:59.100> 120<00:00:59.609> millimeter<00:00:59.969> fan<00:01:00.149> it's

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
right here's 120 millimeter fan it's

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:02.599 
right here's 120 millimeter fan it's
actually<00:01:01.050> a<00:01:01.079> pulse<00:01:01.739> width<00:01:01.859> modulation<00:01:02.250> fan<00:01:02.489> it

00:01:02.599 --> 00:01:02.609 
actually a pulse width modulation fan it

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:05.630 
actually a pulse width modulation fan it
actually<00:01:02.850> goes<00:01:03.000> from<00:01:03.120> 1702<00:01:03.870> 2250<00:01:04.710> RPM<00:01:05.100> gives

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
actually goes from 1702 2250 RPM gives

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:08.750 
actually goes from 1702 2250 RPM gives
you<00:01:05.760> 18<00:01:06.150> to<00:01:06.240> 32<00:01:06.510> decibels<00:01:07.049> and<00:01:07.229> airflow<00:01:08.070> is<00:01:08.400> not

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:08.760 
you 18 to 32 decibels and airflow is not

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:10.700 
you 18 to 32 decibels and airflow is not
really<00:01:08.970> as<00:01:09.060> important<00:01:09.600> and<00:01:10.290> I<00:01:10.350> don't<00:01:10.500> have

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
really as important and I don't have

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:11.990 
really as important and I don't have
that<00:01:10.740> specification<00:01:11.250> but<00:01:11.640> I'm<00:01:11.760> sure<00:01:11.880> it's

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000 
that specification but I'm sure it's

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:12.980 
that specification but I'm sure it's
pretty<00:01:12.150> fine<00:01:12.330> but<00:01:12.450> it's<00:01:12.540> not<00:01:12.630> as<00:01:12.689> important

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
pretty fine but it's not as important

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:14.060 
pretty fine but it's not as important
because<00:01:13.080> you're<00:01:13.260> not<00:01:13.350> pushing<00:01:13.650> air<00:01:13.860> into<00:01:13.979> the

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 
because you're not pushing air into the

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:15.170 
because you're not pushing air into the
case<00:01:14.250> it's<00:01:14.430> more<00:01:14.549> part<00:01:14.729> about<00:01:14.820> pushing<00:01:14.970> air

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180 
case it's more part about pushing air

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:18.649 
case it's more part about pushing air
through<00:01:15.390> the<00:01:16.020> radiator<00:01:16.350> this<00:01:17.310> is<00:01:17.580> your<00:01:18.299> block

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659 
through the radiator this is your block

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:21.859 
through the radiator this is your block
it<00:01:19.290> is<00:01:19.560> copper<00:01:20.430> it<00:01:20.580> has<00:01:20.970> a<00:01:21.210> pre-application

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:21.869 
it is copper it has a pre-application

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:24.560 
it is copper it has a pre-application
there<00:01:22.500> a<00:01:22.530> pre<00:01:22.830> applied<00:01:23.130> thermal<00:01:23.939> paste<00:01:24.299> it's

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 
there a pre applied thermal paste it's

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:25.789 
there a pre applied thermal paste it's
actually<00:01:24.810> like<00:01:24.869> a<00:01:24.930> little<00:01:25.110> compound<00:01:25.500> it's<00:01:25.710> not

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:25.799 
actually like a little compound it's not

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:27.320 
actually like a little compound it's not
really<00:01:25.979> a<00:01:26.040> grease<00:01:26.430> per<00:01:26.670> se<00:01:26.909> it's<00:01:27.119> kind<00:01:27.270> of

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:27.330 
really a grease per se it's kind of

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:30.170 
really a grease per se it's kind of
sticky<00:01:27.630> and<00:01:27.990> stuck<00:01:28.560> on<00:01:28.740> there<00:01:28.979> now<00:01:29.820> there<00:01:30.060> is

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180 
sticky and stuck on there now there is

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:32.240 
sticky and stuck on there now there is
three<00:01:30.509> point<00:01:30.780> two<00:01:30.930> millimeters<00:01:31.470> of<00:01:31.500> static

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250 
three point two millimeters of static

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:34.249 
three point two millimeters of static
pressure<00:01:32.520> in<00:01:32.790> this<00:01:32.939> system<00:01:33.180> so<00:01:33.600> that<00:01:33.810> means

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259 
pressure in this system so that means

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:37.039 
pressure in this system so that means
there's<00:01:34.530> actually<00:01:35.570> pressure<00:01:36.570> in<00:01:36.780> here<00:01:36.930> the

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:37.049 
there's actually pressure in here the

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:39.920 
there's actually pressure in here the
water<00:01:37.290> is<00:01:37.759> building<00:01:38.759> pressure<00:01:39.000> and<00:01:39.780> that's

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:39.930 
water is building pressure and that's

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:41.030 
water is building pressure and that's
good<00:01:40.110> it's<00:01:40.320> going<00:01:40.409> to<00:01:40.500> increase<00:01:40.860> the

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:41.040 
good it's going to increase the

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:43.490 
good it's going to increase the
efficiency<00:01:41.430> of<00:01:41.579> the<00:01:41.880> system<00:01:42.090> on<00:01:42.420> a<00:01:42.450> system<00:01:42.720> the

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500 
efficiency of the system on a system the

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:45.050 
efficiency of the system on a system the
custom<00:01:43.979> build<00:01:44.159> you<00:01:44.280> can't<00:01:44.579> really<00:01:44.759> have

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 
custom build you can't really have

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:46.219 
custom build you can't really have
pressure<00:01:45.329> because<00:01:45.540> you<00:01:45.630> can't<00:01:45.930> seal<00:01:46.200> the

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:46.229 
pressure because you can't seal the

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:48.710 
pressure because you can't seal the
system<00:01:46.770> so<00:01:47.280> they<00:01:47.820> don't<00:01:48.149> have<00:01:48.299> positive

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:48.720 
system so they don't have positive

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:50.810 
system so they don't have positive
pressure<00:01:48.869> this<00:01:49.350> one<00:01:49.680> does<00:01:50.250> and<00:01:50.280> that's<00:01:50.579> really

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:50.820 
pressure this one does and that's really

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:53.600 
pressure this one does and that's really
really<00:01:51.060> cool<00:01:51.149> so<00:01:51.619> that's<00:01:52.619> basically<00:01:52.770> it<00:01:53.130> will

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:53.610 
really cool so that's basically it will

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:55.969 
really cool so that's basically it will
fit<00:01:53.939> just<00:01:53.970> about<00:01:54.180> any<00:01:54.680> CPU<00:01:55.680> that<00:01:55.710> you<00:01:55.890> can

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:55.979 
fit just about any CPU that you can

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:57.649 
fit just about any CPU that you can
throw<00:01:56.189> at<00:01:56.340> it<00:01:56.369> so<00:01:56.670> it's<00:01:56.820> multi<00:01:57.210> bracket

00:01:57.649 --> 00:01:57.659 
throw at it so it's multi bracket

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:01.639 
throw at it so it's multi bracket
multi-chip<00:01:58.290> it<00:01:58.469> will<00:01:58.590> do<00:01:58.710> AMD<00:01:59.189> and<00:01:59.399> the<00:02:00.649> m2

00:02:01.639 --> 00:02:01.649 
multi-chip it will do AMD and the m2

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:04.639 
multi-chip it will do AMD and the m2
