a turnaround made out of four cords
going<00:01:22.170> from<00:01:22.590> the<00:01:22.709> third<00:01:23.069> to<00:01:24.030> the<00:01:24.179> flat<00:01:24.509> third

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810

then ready to start again let me let me
just<00:01:31.590> play<00:01:31.829> it<00:01:31.979> in<00:01:32.159> context<00:01:32.819> so<00:01:32.880> you<00:01:32.969> can<00:01:33.119> see

00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:33.740 
just play it in context so you can see

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:35.809 
just play it in context so you can see
what<00:01:34.740> I'm<00:01:34.859> talking<00:01:35.189> about<00:01:35.250> and<00:01:35.549> then<00:01:35.640> we'll

00:01:35.809 --> 00:01:35.819 
what I'm talking about and then we'll

00:01:35.819 --> 00:01:47.960 
what I'm talking about and then we'll
slow<00:01:36.149> down<00:01:36.359> okay

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:47.970 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:51.940 

okay<00:01:48.720> that<00:01:48.900> was<00:01:49.020> the<00:01:49.050> turnaround

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:51.950 

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:55.030 

okay<00:01:52.939> and<00:01:53.240> notice<00:01:53.960> it's<00:01:54.140> when<00:01:54.320> the<00:01:54.470> fifth<00:01:54.799> of

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:55.040 
okay and notice it's when the fifth of

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:58.030 
okay and notice it's when the fifth of
the<00:01:55.150> chord<00:01:56.150> is<00:01:56.390> on<00:01:56.570> top<00:01:56.869> there's<00:01:57.650> different

00:01:58.030 --> 00:01:58.040 
the chord is on top there's different

00:01:58.040 --> 00:01:59.649 
the chord is on top there's different
turnarounds<00:01:58.430> if<00:01:58.549> the<00:01:58.670> third<00:01:58.880> was<00:01:59.060> on<00:01:59.210> top<00:01:59.420> we'd

00:01:59.649 --> 00:01:59.659 
turnarounds if the third was on top we'd

00:01:59.659 --> 00:02:03.910 
turnarounds if the third was on top we'd
we'd<00:02:00.020> have<00:02:00.170> to<00:02:00.259> do<00:02:00.320> something<00:02:00.590> like<00:02:00.649> fifth<00:02:02.920> if

00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:03.920 
we'd have to do something like fifth if

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:05.260 
we'd have to do something like fifth if
the<00:02:04.070> root<00:02:04.220> was<00:02:04.369> on<00:02:04.520> top<00:02:04.759> we'd<00:02:04.939> have<00:02:05.030> to<00:02:05.149> do

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:05.270 
the root was on top we'd have to do

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:09.040 
the root was on top we'd have to do
something<00:02:05.509> like<00:02:05.600> this<00:02:07.899> there's<00:02:08.899> always

00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:09.050 
something like this there's always

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:10.630 
something like this there's always
there's<00:02:09.500> lots<00:02:09.770> of<00:02:09.920> different<00:02:10.220> turnarounds

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:10.640 
there's lots of different turnarounds

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:12.190 
there's lots of different turnarounds
you<00:02:10.729> can<00:02:10.880> use<00:02:11.060> but<00:02:11.330> this<00:02:11.450> is<00:02:11.630> one<00:02:11.840> that's<00:02:11.989> quite

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:12.200 
you can use but this is one that's quite

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:14.440 
you can use but this is one that's quite
effective<00:02:12.800> when<00:02:13.010> the<00:02:13.130> fifth<00:02:13.400> is<00:02:13.610> on<00:02:13.819> top<00:02:14.120> and

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:14.450 
effective when the fifth is on top and

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:16.660 
effective when the fifth is on top and
you<00:02:14.930> you'll<00:02:15.260> find<00:02:15.500> many<00:02:15.770> situations<00:02:16.459> and

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:16.670 
you you'll find many situations and

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:20.080 
you you'll find many situations and
songs<00:02:16.910> many<00:02:17.330> situations<00:02:18.459> where<00:02:19.459> the<00:02:19.640> fifth<00:02:19.819> is

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:20.090 
songs many situations where the fifth is

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:23.229 
songs many situations where the fifth is
on<00:02:20.269> top<00:02:20.600> the<00:02:20.900> top<00:02:21.290> note<00:02:21.530> of<00:02:21.680> the<00:02:21.800> melody<00:02:22.180> so<00:02:23.180> you

and then D minor 7 now I know that G is

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:20.410 
and then D minor 7 now I know that G is
not<00:03:18.380> in<00:03:18.500> the<00:03:18.590> D<00:03:18.710> minor<00:03:18.920> 7th<00:03:19.310> chord<00:03:19.340> but<00:03:19.670> Jesus

not in the D minor 7th chord but Jesus

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:22.260 
not in the D minor 7th chord but Jesus
Bela<00:03:20.660> D<00:03:20.810> so<00:03:20.960> I'm<00:03:21.050> going<00:03:21.230> to<00:03:21.290> include<00:03:21.530> it<00:03:21.770> there

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:22.270 
Bela D so I'm going to include it there

00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:29.290 
Bela D so I'm going to include it there
so<00:03:25.150> and<00:03:26.150> then<00:03:26.390> finally<00:03:26.870> D<00:03:27.110> flat<00:03:27.440> 7th<00:03:28.150> now<00:03:29.150> I'm

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:29.300 
so and then finally D flat 7th now I'm

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:33.100 
so and then finally D flat 7th now I'm
voicing<00:03:29.810> it<00:03:30.050> like<00:03:30.170> this<00:03:30.350> G<00:03:30.620> on<00:03:30.770> top<00:03:31.120> a<00:03:32.120> flat<00:03:32.840> and

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:33.110 
voicing it like this G on top a flat and

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:36.100 
voicing it like this G on top a flat and
C<00:03:33.980> flat<00:03:34.340> looks<00:03:34.700> like<00:03:34.880> B<00:03:35.120> but<00:03:35.360> it's<00:03:35.480> costly<00:03:35.840> flow

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:36.110 
C flat looks like B but it's costly flow

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:39.930 
C flat looks like B but it's costly flow
because<00:03:36.680> it's<00:03:36.830> a<00:03:36.950> D<00:03:37.100> flat<00:03:37.340> 7th<00:03:37.700> chord<00:03:38.050> now

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:39.940 
because it's a D flat 7th chord now

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:42.550 
because it's a D flat 7th chord now
that's<00:03:40.940> a<00:03:41.060> little<00:03:41.240> a<00:03:41.660> little<00:03:42.080> empty<00:03:42.380> is<00:03:42.530> a

00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:42.560 
that's a little a little empty is a

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:46.130 
that's a little a little empty is a
little<00:03:42.830> for<00:03:42.980> voicing<00:03:43.190> I<00:03:43.430> could<00:03:43.670> do<00:03:43.820> this

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:46.140 

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:48.170 

in<00:03:46.650> other<00:03:46.800> words<00:03:47.040> role<00:03:47.250> of<00:03:47.460> tent<00:03:47.700> my<00:03:47.880> hands

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:48.180 
in other words role of tent my hands

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:49.970 
in other words role of tent my hands
small<00:03:48.450> so<00:03:48.600> I<00:03:48.690> can't<00:03:48.930> play<00:03:49.170> all<00:03:49.440> the<00:03:49.590> notes<00:03:49.710> I'd

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:49.980 
small so I can't play all the notes I'd

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:52.820 
small so I can't play all the notes I'd
want<00:03:50.220> to<00:03:50.400> but<00:03:50.640> I<00:03:50.820> could<00:03:51.240> do<00:03:51.360> this<00:03:51.390> D<00:03:52.260> flat<00:03:52.590> E

00:03:52.820 --> 00:03:52.830

00:03:52.830 --> 00:04:03.890 
want to but I could do this D flat E
flat<00:03:52.890> F<00:03:53.610> a<00:03:54.090> flat

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:03.900 

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:07.710 

I<00:04:03.930> do<00:04:04.860> it<00:04:04.950> quickly<00:04:05.220> I<00:04:05.430> can<00:04:05.670> get<00:04:05.730> away<00:04:05.849> with

00:04:07.710 --> 00:04:07.720 
I do it quickly I can get away with

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:09.540 
I do it quickly I can get away with
but<00:04:08.500> if<00:04:08.650> you<00:04:08.740> don't<00:04:08.860> want<00:04:08.980> to<00:04:09.040> do<00:04:09.130> that<00:04:09.250> just

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:09.550 
but if you don't want to do that just

play the play the octave D flat with
those<00:04:13.360> three<00:04:13.630> notes<00:04:13.780> and<00:04:14.050> that'll<00:04:14.320> work

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:14.400 
those three notes and that'll work

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:16.860 
those three notes and that'll work
because<00:04:15.400> you<00:04:15.550> know<00:04:15.940> you're<00:04:16.239> only<00:04:16.360> holding<00:04:16.510> one
