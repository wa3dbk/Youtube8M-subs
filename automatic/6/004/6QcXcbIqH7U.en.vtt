 online computers today I'm going to do 

00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:09.650
 a video to clarify the subject a bit 

00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:11.900
 of the samsung galaxy 6 routing what 

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:13.849
 first of all and try to do it as 

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:18.020
 I put you in the video that I will leave for you 

00:00:13.849 --> 00:00:19.430
 here the description of the link go this 

00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:21.199
 it is the first thing of all to try to do it 

00:00:19.430 --> 00:00:23.240
 as the first option as I do 

00:00:21.199 --> 00:00:25.880
 in the video and if not, it's not 

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:28.730
 it works use the second option that 

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:31.400
 it consists of doing the same steps but 

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:34.550
 run first a file that is his 

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:37.700
 droid dots etc and we assure you first 

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:40.070
 is to be and then we execute the root point 

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:41.690
 zip downloaded from the first option if 

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:44.060
 a signal works 

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:47.630
 we make the first step of ltc android 

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:50.120
 point zip and then we install the file 

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:52.489
 of update zip 

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:55.010
 then then as soon as you update a 

00:00:52.489 --> 00:00:58.160
 Once installed here, you have 

00:00:55.010 --> 00:01:01.579
 superuser is worth there is is without 

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:03.260
 update 3 we go here here says maxim 

00:01:01.579 --> 00:01:05.210
 list many you ask me that it will not be 

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:07.310
 no application does not have to 

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:08.840
 leave any application this the first 

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:10.520
 Once you execute it, it does not issue any 

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:12.619
 application since you have not given 

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:15.870
 superuser permissions to none 

00:01:12.619 --> 00:01:19.230
 application ok let's go to settings 

00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:22.170
 and here says superuser such information 

00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:24.780
 here we have tap twitter page this 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:26.610
 means that we click to check 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:28.409
 updates we press and it will give us 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:32.159
 the error 

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:34.259
 the error sign after error is worth failed 

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:35.939
 it says there is that failed then what 

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:39.210
 you have to do is just go to 

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:41.670
 google play store search super user and 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:43.369
 here exposes update then already as 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:46.770
 here exposes updatable is to update 

00:01:43.369 --> 00:01:48.959
 you accept and download and install the 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:49.770
 Superuser update does not have to 

00:01:48.959 --> 00:01:51.920
 do nothing more 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:54.740
 this is already installed and you see there 

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:56.509
 we unload 

00:01:54.740 --> 00:02:00.020
 and there is no need to do anything else 

00:01:56.509 --> 00:02:02.420
 you to turn crazy because it is already not 

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:06.700
 to leave any application or anything for 

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:06.700
 the style is worth installing 

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:12.030
 and we're going to open so you can see 

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:19.300
 agree and if you see or change a bit 

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:21.610
 the interface and we have a little bit of 

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:24.760
 information we should do a rut 

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:26.860
 temporary etcetera 

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:28.330
 here are the applications there is no 

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:30.400
 applications on the list do not have 

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:33.360
 what to leave because as I said before 

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:36.040
 we have given permission to any application 

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:38.080
 register well the record and so on 

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:40.900
 here are preferences that you can 

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:42.490
 change for pin and so on 

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:44.140
 this brings this fret is a bit with 

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:46.540
 but I would leave it as it is 

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:48.910
 then I hope that at last they have 

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:50.830
 clarified your doubts and nothing if still 

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:52.600
 so you have some other curious as 

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:54.340
 it does not stop being the comments 

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:56.200
 I hope it has been useful to give you life 

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:59.160

00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:59.160
