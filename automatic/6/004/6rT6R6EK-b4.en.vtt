hi<00:00:03.840> everyone<00:00:04.200> today<00:00:04.529> I<00:00:05.430> will<00:00:05.609> show<00:00:05.970> you<00:00:06.029> how<00:00:06.509> to

00:00:06.530 --> 00:00:06.540 
hi everyone today I will show you how to

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:10.250 
hi everyone today I will show you how to
add<00:00:07.340> numbers<00:00:08.340> in<00:00:08.610> series<00:00:09.030> for<00:00:09.570> example<00:00:09.660> if<00:00:10.110> I

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:10.260 
add numbers in series for example if I

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:16.609 
add numbers in series for example if I
have<00:00:10.440> to<00:00:10.620> add<00:00:10.830> 1<00:00:11.420> +<00:00:12.420> 2<00:00:12.690> +<00:00:13.410> 3<00:00:13.910> up<00:00:14.910> to<00:00:15.240> X<00:00:15.540> when<00:00:16.500> the

00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:16.619 
have to add 1 + 2 + 3 up to X when the

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:21.439 
have to add 1 + 2 + 3 up to X when the
sum<00:00:16.859> will<00:00:17.100> be<00:00:17.130> X<00:00:17.960> into<00:00:18.960> X<00:00:19.230> plus<00:00:19.410> 1<00:00:19.980> divided<00:00:20.910> by<00:00:21.060> 2

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:21.449 
sum will be X into X plus 1 divided by 2

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:25.609 
sum will be X into X plus 1 divided by 2
for<00:00:22.320> example<00:00:22.830> if<00:00:23.550> I<00:00:23.820> have<00:00:24.000> numbers<00:00:24.390> from<00:00:24.570> 1<00:00:24.810> +<00:00:25.350> 2

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:25.619 
for example if I have numbers from 1 + 2

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:30.160 
for example if I have numbers from 1 + 2
+<00:00:25.890> 3<00:00:26.900> up<00:00:27.900> to<00:00:28.199> 9<00:00:28.439> then<00:00:29.099> all<00:00:29.279> I<00:00:29.310> have<00:00:29.519> to<00:00:29.640> do<00:00:29.789> is

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:30.170 
+ 3 up to 9 then all I have to do is

00:00:30.170 --> 00:00:34.729 
+ 3 up to 9 then all I have to do is
multiply<00:00:31.170> 9<00:00:31.740> by<00:00:32.040> 10<00:00:32.700> and<00:00:33.120> divide<00:00:33.600> by<00:00:34.110> 2<00:00:34.170> should

00:00:34.729 --> 00:00:34.739 
multiply 9 by 10 and divide by 2 should

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:43.490 
multiply 9 by 10 and divide by 2 should
I<00:00:34.890> will<00:00:35.100> be<00:00:35.239> 45<00:00:37.040> similarly<00:00:38.040> 1<00:00:38.670> +<00:00:39.239> 2<00:00:39.510> +<00:00:40.320> 3<00:00:40.850> -<00:00:41.850> 19<00:00:42.500> -

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:43.500 
I will be 45 similarly 1 + 2 + 3 - 19 -

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:50.930 
I will be 45 similarly 1 + 2 + 3 - 19 -
I<00:00:43.559> have<00:00:43.800> to<00:00:43.980> do<00:00:44.129> is<00:00:44.370> 19<00:00:45.260> into<00:00:46.260> 20

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:53.689 

now<00:00:51.510> suppose<00:00:52.050> the<00:00:52.710> number<00:00:53.039> doesn't<00:00:53.280> start

00:00:53.689 --> 00:00:53.699 
now suppose the number doesn't start

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:56.410 
now suppose the number doesn't start
from<00:00:53.940> one<00:00:54.180> but<00:00:54.960> start<00:00:55.350> from<00:00:55.530> something<00:00:55.949> else

00:00:56.410 --> 00:00:56.420 
from one but start from something else

00:00:56.420 --> 00:01:03.590 
from one but start from something else
for<00:00:57.420> example<00:00:58.219> 10<00:00:59.360> plus<00:01:00.360> 11<00:01:01.230> plus<00:01:01.460> 12<00:01:02.480> and<00:01:03.480> it

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
for example 10 plus 11 plus 12 and it

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:08.749 
for example 10 plus 11 plus 12 and it
goes<00:01:03.839> to<00:01:04.220> 19<00:01:05.220> so<00:01:06.060> first<00:01:06.780> I<00:01:06.990> have<00:01:07.229> to<00:01:07.409> add<00:01:07.759> number

00:01:08.749 --> 00:01:08.759 
goes to 19 so first I have to add number

00:01:08.759 --> 00:01:13.480 
goes to 19 so first I have to add number
from<00:01:08.940> 1<00:01:09.210> to<00:01:09.240> 19<00:01:09.930> that<00:01:10.830> will<00:01:11.070> be<00:01:11.250> 19<00:01:12.240> into<00:01:12.840> 20

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:13.490 
from 1 to 19 that will be 19 into 20

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:17.060 
from 1 to 19 that will be 19 into 20
divided<00:01:14.490> by<00:01:14.520> 2<00:01:15.420> and<00:01:15.690> then<00:01:16.289> I<00:01:16.320> have<00:01:16.470> to<00:01:16.680> subtract

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 
divided by 2 and then I have to subtract

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:20.800 
divided by 2 and then I have to subtract
number<00:01:17.490> from<00:01:17.700> 1<00:01:17.940> to<00:01:17.970> 9<00:01:18.360> so<00:01:19.350> that<00:01:19.380> will<00:01:19.799> be<00:01:19.950> 9

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:20.810 
number from 1 to 9 so that will be 9

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:27.169 
number from 1 to 9 so that will be 9
into<00:01:21.810> 10<00:01:22.009> divided<00:01:23.009> by<00:01:25.310> this<00:01:26.310> can<00:01:26.580> also<00:01:26.850> become

00:01:27.169 --> 00:01:27.179 
into 10 divided by this can also become

00:01:27.179 --> 00:01:29.510 
into 10 divided by this can also become
a<00:01:27.450> general<00:01:27.869> formula<00:01:28.319> for<00:01:28.530> example<00:01:28.770> if<00:01:29.220> I<00:01:29.369> have

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
a general formula for example if I have

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:37.040 
a general formula for example if I have
X<00:01:30.319> plus<00:01:31.319> X<00:01:32.280> plus<00:01:32.789> 1<00:01:33.090> plus<00:01:34.190> X<00:01:35.190> plus<00:01:35.670> 2<00:01:36.060> and<00:01:36.390> it

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:37.050 
X plus X plus 1 plus X plus 2 and it

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:41.059 
X plus X plus 1 plus X plus 2 and it
goes<00:01:37.319> to<00:01:37.560> Y<00:01:37.830> then<00:01:38.759> all<00:01:39.119> I<00:01:39.149> have<00:01:39.390> to<00:01:39.509> do<00:01:39.690> is<00:01:40.069> first

00:01:41.059 --> 00:01:41.069 
goes to Y then all I have to do is first

00:01:41.069 --> 00:01:45.039 
goes to Y then all I have to do is first
add<00:01:41.399> number<00:01:42.299> from<00:01:42.630> 1<00:01:42.899> to<00:01:42.929> Y<00:01:43.350> that<00:01:44.250> will<00:01:44.490> be<00:01:44.610> Y

00:01:45.039 --> 00:01:45.049 
add number from 1 to Y that will be Y

00:01:45.049 --> 00:01:51.529 
add number from 1 to Y that will be Y
into<00:01:46.049> y<00:01:46.319> plus<00:01:47.220> 1<00:01:47.750> divided<00:01:48.750> by<00:01:48.899> 2<00:01:49.549> minus<00:01:50.549> number

00:01:51.529 --> 00:01:51.539 
into y plus 1 divided by 2 minus number

00:01:51.539 --> 00:01:56.779 
into y plus 1 divided by 2 minus number
from<00:01:52.429> 1<00:01:53.429> to<00:01:54.149> X<00:01:54.360> minus<00:01:54.899> 1<00:01:55.079> so<00:01:55.320> remember<00:01:55.680> we<00:01:56.490> have

00:01:56.779 --> 00:01:56.789 
from 1 to X minus 1 so remember we have

00:01:56.789 --> 00:01:59.510 
from 1 to X minus 1 so remember we have
X<00:01:57.090> in<00:01:57.420> the<00:01:57.570> series<00:01:57.869> so<00:01:58.049> we<00:01:58.200> have<00:01:58.439> to<00:01:58.619> subtract

00:01:59.510 --> 00:01:59.520 
X in the series so we have to subtract

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:02.870 
X in the series so we have to subtract
number<00:01:59.939> until<00:02:00.329> X<00:02:00.600> minus<00:02:01.049> 1<00:02:01.229> so<00:02:01.649> that<00:02:01.680> will<00:02:02.039> be<00:02:02.219> X

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:02.880 
number until X minus 1 so that will be X

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:08.559 
number until X minus 1 so that will be X
minus<00:02:03.299> 1<00:02:04.399> into<00:02:05.399> X<00:02:05.750> divided<00:02:06.750> by

00:02:08.559 --> 00:02:08.569 
minus 1 into X divided by

00:02:08.569 --> 00:02:11.440 
minus 1 into X divided by
so<00:02:09.080> this<00:02:09.229> is<00:02:09.379> the<00:02:09.470> general<00:02:09.800> formula<00:02:10.450> this

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:11.450 
so this is the general formula this

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:14.470 
so this is the general formula this
formula<00:02:11.510> is<00:02:12.200> not<00:02:12.650> if<00:02:13.580> you<00:02:13.760> don't<00:02:13.849> want<00:02:13.970> to<00:02:14.180> cram

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:14.480 
formula is not if you don't want to cram

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:15.850 
formula is not if you don't want to cram
it<00:02:14.659> and<00:02:14.810> want<00:02:14.959> to<00:02:15.019> understand<00:02:15.470> how<00:02:15.680> this

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:15.860 
it and want to understand how this

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:18.940 
it and want to understand how this
formula<00:02:16.099> was<00:02:16.310> generated<00:02:16.760> so<00:02:17.390> let's<00:02:17.650> go<00:02:18.650> to<00:02:18.709> the

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:18.950 
formula was generated so let's go to the

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:26.979 
formula was generated so let's go to the
series<00:02:19.220> again<00:02:19.489> so<00:02:20.090> we<00:02:20.239> have<00:02:20.269> 1<00:02:21.200> +<00:02:21.860> 2<00:02:22.159> +<00:02:22.400> 3<00:02:23.799> 4<00:02:24.910> 5<00:02:25.989> 6

00:02:26.979 --> 00:02:26.989 
series again so we have 1 + 2 + 3 4 5 6

00:02:26.989 --> 00:02:32.380 
series again so we have 1 + 2 + 3 4 5 6
7<00:02:27.980> +<00:02:28.730> 8<00:02:29.060> +<00:02:29.330> 1<00:02:30.080> so<00:02:31.040> you<00:02:31.099> can<00:02:31.129> see<00:02:31.430> that<00:02:31.700> these

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:32.390 
7 + 8 + 1 so you can see that these

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:38.289 
7 + 8 + 1 so you can see that these
numbers<00:02:32.650> 1<00:02:33.650> &amp;<00:02:33.860> 9<00:02:34.060> add<00:02:35.060> up<00:02:35.480> to<00:02:35.780> be<00:02:35.930> 10<00:02:36.970> then<00:02:37.970> push

00:02:38.289 --> 00:02:38.299 
numbers 1 &amp; 9 add up to be 10 then push

00:02:38.299 --> 00:02:42.610 
numbers 1 &amp; 9 add up to be 10 then push
to<00:02:39.049> it<00:02:40.269> again<00:02:41.269> add<00:02:41.480> up<00:02:41.720> to<00:02:42.049> the<00:02:42.170> 10

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:42.620 
to it again add up to the 10

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:49.449 
to it again add up to the 10
in<00:02:43.310> 3<00:02:43.549> 2<00:02:43.819> 7<00:02:44.319> is<00:02:45.319> again<00:02:45.739> 10<00:02:46.069> and<00:02:46.400> then<00:02:47.299> 4<00:02:47.599> to<00:02:48.079> 6<00:02:48.459> is

00:02:49.449 --> 00:02:49.459 
in 3 2 7 is again 10 and then 4 to 6 is

00:02:49.459 --> 00:02:52.960 
in 3 2 7 is again 10 and then 4 to 6 is
again<00:02:49.849> and<00:02:50.599> and<00:02:50.840> I'm<00:02:51.140> left<00:02:51.349> with<00:02:51.530> 5<00:02:51.859> so<00:02:52.790> that

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:52.970 
again and and I'm left with 5 so that

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:56.830 
again and and I'm left with 5 so that
itself<00:02:53.470> so<00:02:54.470> if<00:02:54.709> you<00:02:54.920> add<00:02:55.129> all<00:02:55.609> this<00:02:55.790> up<00:02:55.970> it<00:02:56.629> will

00:02:56.830 --> 00:02:56.840 
itself so if you add all this up it will

00:02:56.840 --> 00:03:07.289 
itself so if you add all this up it will
be<00:02:59.319> 4.5<00:03:00.370> so<00:03:01.370> we<00:03:01.519> have<00:03:01.670> 4<00:03:02.660> times<00:03:03.370> 10<00:03:04.370> and<00:03:06.190> half

00:03:07.289 --> 00:03:07.299 
be 4.5 so we have 4 times 10 and half

00:03:07.299 --> 00:03:12.789 
be 4.5 so we have 4 times 10 and half
times<00:03:08.299> 10<00:03:09.170> to<00:03:09.560> 4<00:03:09.769> point<00:03:10.040> 5<00:03:10.250> into<00:03:11.060> 10

00:03:12.789 --> 00:03:12.799 
times 10 to 4 point 5 into 10

00:03:12.799 --> 00:03:18.760 
times 10 to 4 point 5 into 10
oh<00:03:13.540> that<00:03:14.540> is<00:03:14.750> 9<00:03:15.560> by<00:03:15.889> 2

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:18.770 

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:23.620 

yeah<00:03:19.760> so<00:03:20.660> that<00:03:20.810> is<00:03:20.960> equivalent<00:03:21.230> to<00:03:21.440> X<00:03:22.310> into<00:03:23.300> X

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:23.630 
yeah so that is equivalent to X into X

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:30.520 
yeah so that is equivalent to X into X
plus<00:03:24.110> 1<00:03:24.470> divided<00:03:25.280> by<00:03:26.920> now<00:03:27.920> if<00:03:28.790> I<00:03:29.030> add<00:03:29.270> 10<00:03:29.930> to

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:30.530 
plus 1 divided by now if I add 10 to

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:34.200 
plus 1 divided by now if I add 10 to
this<00:03:30.740> series<00:03:31.490> so<00:03:32.270> I<00:03:32.300> will<00:03:32.660> have<00:03:32.840> one<00:03:33.200> more<00:03:33.410> 10

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:34.210 
this series so I will have one more 10

00:03:34.210 --> 00:03:39.190 
this series so I will have one more 10
plus<00:03:35.210> 10<00:03:35.710> so<00:03:36.710> that<00:03:36.740> will<00:03:37.100> be<00:03:37.250> 5<00:03:37.580> point<00:03:38.000> 5<00:03:38.300> into

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:39.200 
plus 10 so that will be 5 point 5 into

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:45.730 
plus 10 so that will be 5 point 5 into
10<00:03:39.790> that<00:03:40.790> will<00:03:41.060> be<00:03:41.270> 50<00:03:43.360> so<00:03:44.360> again<00:03:44.690> that<00:03:45.530> will<00:03:45.680> be

00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:45.740 
10 that will be 50 so again that will be

00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:48.320 
10 that will be 50 so again that will be
equal<00:03:46.100> to

00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:48.330 
equal to

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:56.130 
equal to
and<00:03:49.330> into<00:03:53.280> 11/4<00:03:54.280> again<00:03:54.610> X<00:03:54.970> into<00:03:55.570> X<00:03:55.720> plus<00:03:55.840> 1

00:03:56.130 --> 00:03:56.140 
and into 11/4 again X into X plus 1

00:03:56.140 --> 00:03:59.640 
and into 11/4 again X into X plus 1
value<00:03:56.560> but<00:03:56.710> I<00:03:57.070> hope<00:03:57.640> this<00:03:57.970> will<00:03:58.150> help<00:03:58.210> and<00:03:58.660> I

00:03:59.640 --> 00:03:59.650 
value but I hope this will help and I

00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:02.430 
value but I hope this will help and I
