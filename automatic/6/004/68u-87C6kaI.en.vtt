00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:22.799 
sure myself but ultimately it seems that

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:24.890 
sure myself but ultimately it seems that
the<00:01:23.040> that<00:01:23.460> from<00:01:23.790> below<00:01:24.090> is<00:01:24.330> going<00:01:24.570> to<00:01:24.659> be<00:01:24.780> at

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
the that from below is going to be at

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:26.929 
the that from below is going to be at
bow<00:01:25.080> expansion<00:01:25.650> which<00:01:25.799> is<00:01:25.920> also<00:01:26.130> really<00:01:26.610> cool

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:26.939 
bow expansion which is also really cool

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:28.940 
bow expansion which is also really cool
because<00:01:27.119> I<00:01:27.509> really<00:01:28.049> want<00:01:28.200> to<00:01:28.259> play<00:01:28.619> wow<00:01:28.920> again

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
and I think the next expansion mine

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:32.929 
and I think the next expansion mine
actually<00:01:31.170> make<00:01:31.619> it<00:01:31.710> worth<00:01:31.920> playing<00:01:32.250> again<00:01:32.520> but

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:32.939 
actually make it worth playing again but

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:52.789 
actually going to come out way earlier
than<00:01:51.180> the<00:01:51.390> power<00:01:51.570> expansion<00:01:52.110> which<00:01:52.470> means<00:01:52.680> we

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:52.799 
than the power expansion which means we

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:55.609 
than the power expansion which means we
could<00:01:52.950> already<00:01:53.130> see<00:01:53.369> like<00:01:53.729> in<00:01:53.850> early<00:01:54.210> 2014<00:01:54.689> at

00:01:55.609 --> 00:01:55.619 
could already see like in early 2014 at

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:57.109 
could already see like in early 2014 at
the<00:01:55.740> outer<00:01:55.890> expansion<00:01:56.549> and<00:01:56.759> the<00:01:56.790> bomb

00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:57.119 
the outer expansion and the bomb

00:01:57.119 --> 00:01:59.270 
the outer expansion and the bomb
expansion<00:01:57.540> probably<00:01:57.840> like<00:01:58.110> later<00:01:58.950> that<00:01:59.130> year

00:01:59.270 --> 00:01:59.280 
expansion probably like later that year

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:02.209 
expansion probably like later that year
in<00:01:59.610> the<00:01:59.700> second<00:02:00.030> half<00:02:00.210> summer<00:02:00.509> and<00:02:01.219> it's

00:02:02.209 --> 00:02:02.219 
in the second half summer and it's

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:03.830 
in the second half summer and it's
really<00:02:02.430> cool<00:02:02.670> because<00:02:02.729> the<00:02:03.240> focus<00:02:03.420> is<00:02:03.689> going

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:03.840 
really cool because the focus is going

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:05.600 
really cool because the focus is going
to<00:02:03.960> be<00:02:04.020> on<00:02:04.170> Diablo<00:02:04.619> it's<00:02:05.070> going<00:02:05.250> to<00:02:05.280> be<00:02:05.399> a<00:02:05.430> lot

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:05.610 
to be on Diablo it's going to be a lot

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:08.059 
to be on Diablo it's going to be a lot

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:04.620 
pieces then end game system details

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:06.680
