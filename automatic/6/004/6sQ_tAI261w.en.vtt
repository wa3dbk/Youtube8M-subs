00:00:00.920 --> 00:00:06.629
 Welcome to the unboxing of the faurÃ© 

00:00:03.449 --> 00:00:08.429
 mediapad m10 fh.de tablets last thing 

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:10.559
 year in Taiwan we were introduced 

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:13.620
 have a full hd display in here 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:15.870
 this beautiful 10 inch tablet in there and 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:17.640
 a metal case like that of the ipad 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:20.250
 actually know the packaging 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:21.810
 Pretty chic plain and white 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:23.820
 we have a side a bit here 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:25.859
 a high quality way lobo dear 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:27.840
 of course the name described on the 

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:29.820
 front can also be a bit like 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:33.719
 the device already looks it looks 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:35.040
 too or seems to be very thin and 

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:38.820
 there is still a bit written here 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:40.469
 the hi-virus is sort of through the 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:44.100
 tablet is unlocked means we 

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:46.800
 can enjoy life better now 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:47.940
 a tablet allegedly loud back 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:48.480
 are a bit technical data 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:49.860
 written 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:51.180
 you can do that here a bit 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:55.020
 maybe reading is not all that 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:58.670
 a lot on it but eight inches 8 megapixel 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:01:01.050
 full hd screen, however, with 1200 

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:02.399
 pixel on solutions the highest is something 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:03.780
 unlike us for one 

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:05.220
 competitor and now we are looking 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:07.830
 Just give us a look at what they are in 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:11.850
 this something already demolished white 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:13.799
 Packaging contents in it is as 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:14.820
 First of all, the tablet itself 

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:18.299
 of course, now in the off 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:19.500
 condition is he comes to something 

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:21.180
 we will take a closer look 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:22.729
 little bit of what we have in the packaging 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:25.200
 still be found 

00:01:22.729 --> 00:01:26.939
 Among other things, we have a few here 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:31.909
 small towels with not too 

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:34.079
 a lot of paper but that in 23 languages 

00:01:31.909 --> 00:01:35.790
 Of course, then we have, of course 

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:38.250
 still a power supply with it and a 

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:40.799
 USB cable in the USB cable can be animal 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:42.780
 clearly see immediately this is he apple 

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:44.670
 similar to no standard micro sbw it 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:46.770
 already known by many for now 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:49.560
 Last year was still its own 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:52.670
 standard also uses its airfield pin 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:54.780
 standard probably also 

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:56.820
 Picture material that could then 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:59.939
 but in one of our other 

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:02.159
 then watch videos and the power supply 

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:04.920
 Here we have a matte look outside 

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:06.550
 is where the logo on it except here the 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:08.979
 very small technical description 

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:11.080
 then on that we with 2 amps 

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:12.700
 that means the tablet can get power 

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:14.170
 also be charged quite fast 

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:16.930
 if we go back here or to one now 

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:19.140
 Of course, tablet is also here 

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:20.890
 here we have the unboxing up here 

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:22.630
 again still fall a 

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:24.550
 front camera not only an 8 megapixel 

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:26.950
 Camera on the back below that 

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:29.230
 Of course, logo clearly here in the frame 

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:30.760
 the frame is smaller by the way 

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:32.320
 to be like the ipad look us 

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:35.410
 however, compare a same 

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:37.660
 we have a plastic up here 

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:39.870
 Conversion of the aluminum still with 

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:42.310
 behind it a flap 

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:44.020
 and we not only there 

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:45.730
 a micro sd can insert but 

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:49.570
 also a sim card the whole is so 

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:53.290
 accordingly also here in the mobile 

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:54.730
 use in the internet so to speak usable 

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:56.500
 we have the 8 megapixel camera here 

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:58.420
 which have already mentioned , however 

00:02:56.500 --> 00:03:00.520
 there is also a picture with it 

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:01.690
 not really a standard feature 

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:03.520
 is like most tablet 

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:04.060
 Manufacturer The microphone is located 

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:06.190
 slightly above it 

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:08.260
 we have a headphone jack and 

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:12.000
 microphones on and at the bottom 

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:14.530
 not only is the docking connection for 

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:16.060
 the transfer of data and that 

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:17.920
 recharge but we still have two 

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:20.500
 small holes because there are still 

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:22.360
 a keyboard that you can buy 

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:24.760
 the latter is not included 

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:26.890
 was there still a reality in 

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:28.540
 Germany is probably more of the 

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:30.760
 agency said and then we have here 

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:34.560
 once volume control of course and 

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:36.670
 the on and off switch on the side 

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:37.900
 have looked at the back again 

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:39.459
 we also have two speakers here 

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:41.350
 is the whole story and if you put it in 

00:03:39.459 --> 00:03:43.420
 Two hands hold it in two 

00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:45.580
 Hands can hold this wonderful 

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:47.020
 to watch movies use 

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:48.790
 of course the sound then backwards 

00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:51.370
 goes out and the logo is also talk 

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:54.820
 nicely engraved in the device i 

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:55.810
 Turn that on now and then for us 

00:03:54.820 --> 00:03:58.390
 Keep the display a bit longer 

00:03:55.810 --> 00:04:00.610
 Watch for full hd here is the 

00:03:58.390 --> 00:04:03.190
 the pixel density is so high that you 

00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:04.930
 probably nothing or none at all 

00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:06.430
 pixel should be that can be that 

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:07.120
 I completely discharged it, too 

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:08.769
 half as wild 

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:10.840
 then show you the complete 

00:04:08.769 --> 00:04:13.150
 test video then later as the looks 

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:13.810
 Now the right comparison with 

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:17.019
 the apple 

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:19.120
 something not a 10 2 1 or 1 16 to 9 

00:04:17.019 --> 00:04:19.570
 display has but 4 3 display can 

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:22.570
 you see 

00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:26.230
 the huawei is a bit higher and 

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:27.450
 if I put it on each other then then 

00:04:26.230 --> 00:04:29.620
 you can clearly see that the 

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:33.100
 design language is quite similar to the 

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:36.669
 Edges are just as rounded off the ipad 

00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:38.500
 looks a bit thicker and it is 

00:04:36.669 --> 00:04:40.810
 even wider so not only 

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:42.250
 higher as you can see here on the frame 

00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:44.190
 However, it is not quite possible to recognize 

00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:45.970
 a centimeter 

00:04:44.190 --> 00:04:47.650
 then I had one more here 

00:04:45.970 --> 00:04:53.860
 cheap tablet from asus what in itself 

00:04:47.650 --> 00:04:55.300
 much easier is the media the nemo 301 

00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:58.570
 active in blue 

00:04:55.300 --> 00:05:00.310
 which also has a plastic feeling he 

00:04:58.570 --> 00:05:02.530
 how metal feeling costs but how 

00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:04.150
 said only 300 euros not 400 euros 

00:05:02.530 --> 00:05:07.690
 synonymous not a full hd display but only 

00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:11.200
 a hd display means the resolution is 

00:05:07.690 --> 00:05:13.990
 1280 x 800 and at the height that is also 

00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:15.810
 a few millimeters wider than that 

00:05:13.990 --> 00:05:19.060
 whole screen frame is actually 

00:05:15.810 --> 00:05:20.740
 a little bit bigger outside 

00:05:19.060 --> 00:05:23.320
 However, that also has the front as well 

00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:24.729
 behind a camera just like android jelly 

00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:27.010
 So bean os the same operating system 

00:05:24.729 --> 00:05:28.660
 installed and even if we did that 

00:05:27.010 --> 00:05:30.520
 look at a design such as a 

00:05:28.660 --> 00:05:32.140
 they are actually similar but thick 

00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:33.850
 as since the asus something easier thereby 

00:05:32.140 --> 00:05:34.450
 that not so much metal used 

00:05:33.850 --> 00:05:37.150
 has been 

00:05:34.450 --> 00:05:41.050
 and there we have no microphones 

00:05:37.150 --> 00:05:43.780
 no microphone directly above the camera and 

00:05:41.050 --> 00:05:45.280
 also no lightning in cultivated is called tim 

00:05:43.780 --> 00:05:47.169
 We can probably cohen too 

00:05:45.280 --> 00:05:48.400
 we 'll shoot better photos 

00:05:47.169 --> 00:05:50.110
 but are dark a first 

00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:51.490
 a bit ridiculous if you go with one 

00:05:50.110 --> 00:05:53.740
 tablet also the concert for example 

00:05:51.490 --> 00:05:55.510
 makes photos or videos but there are 

00:05:53.740 --> 00:05:57.820
 yes always people like to do that 

00:05:55.510 --> 00:05:59.100
 just because here is a sim card 

00:05:57.820 --> 00:06:02.590
 you can really be in there 

00:05:59.100 --> 00:06:04.630
 en route facebook e-mail and more 

00:06:02.590 --> 00:06:05.740
 and that is the very good camera 

00:06:04.630 --> 00:06:07.930
 maybe not such a bad one 

00:06:05.740 --> 00:06:10.870
 good idea my name is ballashk all this 

00:06:07.930 --> 00:06:12.550
 here was the huawei mediapad 10 11h the 

00:06:10.870 --> 00:06:15.960
 first unboxing and comparing and to 

00:06:12.550 --> 00:06:15.960
 graveled and see you next time
