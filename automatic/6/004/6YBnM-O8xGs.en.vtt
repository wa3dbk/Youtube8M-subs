00:00:03.650 --> 00:00:08.600
 hello guys third and last day 

00:00:05.870 --> 00:00:10.610
 unfortunately behind I got to 

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:14.240
 try one in depth enough 

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:17.289
 star fox zero per view demo and le 

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:19.430
 impressions are positive however not 

00:00:17.289 --> 00:00:21.789
 nothing i haven't seen anything i 'm at 

00:00:19.430 --> 00:00:24.769
 get my hair done and the demo was 

00:00:21.789 --> 00:00:26.750
 relatively long we talk about 93 

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:29.089
 minutes to be a demo from here in 

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:31.999
 fair was basically divided into two 

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:34.310
 share a first part with a dog fight 

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:36.110
 with a typical aerial pursuit of the 

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:38.720
 saga is a second part where I had to 

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:41.630
 instead one had to defend a tower from 

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:44.180
 a series of arachnoid attackers on 

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:45.380
 four mechanical legs and clearly le 

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:48.380
 two parts played a lot 

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:51.200
 different during the first echoes of 

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:52.850
 of the 3ds version of the remake for 

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:55.760
 3ds especially at the system level 

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:58.910
 control were very strong so the 

00:00:55.760 --> 00:01:01.220
 39 it was roughly controlled on 

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:03.800
 same in the same way as that 

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:05.449
 view on the thing or laptop too 

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:08.120
 because in the demo we tried 

00:01:05.449 --> 00:01:09.410
 it was not implemented as we have 

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:11.660
 seen instead at the presentation of 

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:14.450
 nintendo to direct the possibility of 

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:16.400
 use the gyroscope of the web as a system 

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:17.600
 of control therefore with regard to 

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:19.400
 that kind of serious enjoyment 

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:21.200
 I can't express myself like I said 

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:23.810
 this morning during breakfast with 

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:25.730
 i think space for my games 

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:26.840
 recent boss platoon experience and the 

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:28.670
 seed of control that can work 

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:31.580
 very well but that requires some 

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:33.640
 time to get used to and the second part 

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:37.310
 instead of the demo it was as said 

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:40.220
 complicated because the arachnids and routes 

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:42.320
 they were on the ground and aiming to hold the 

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:44.300
 aiming reticle as they ascended and yes 

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:46.479
 they were not always easy to move 

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:49.610
 given close to failing the mission 

00:01:46.479 --> 00:01:52.190
 lucky i did it 

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:54.410
 and above all thanks to the loaded shot 

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:56.810
 because the group loaded once 

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:58.340
 the enemy in the retirement retreat goes to 

00:01:56.810 --> 00:02:00.800
 then take the research though 

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:03.260
 the friend moves from redigolo after having 

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:04.610
 released the button the complicated it 

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:06.229
 goes to take research and ease 

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:06.760
 then discreetly to life at 

00:02:06.229 --> 00:02:08.899
 player 

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:11.450
 otherwise life was enough 

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:13.790
 back to graphic level ie not that 

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:14.840
 if it were ugly, it is the impression that 

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:17.959
 several details 

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:22.370
 nc they were still one of a right one 

00:02:17.959 --> 00:02:25.580
 the colors are very good 

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:27.410
 live brightly but in my opinion a 

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:29.780
 graphic level is still to work 

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:32.959
 and it is one of the reasons why I am not 

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:35.900
 let go of sensational findings 

00:02:32.959 --> 00:02:37.790
 in short, for the rest if he did not have 

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:39.290
 known that the game is developed by 

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:41.660
 platinum games I would have struggled to 

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:44.420
 say it because so far or at least in the 

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:45.830
 demo shown there was very little 

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:47.930
 their own sack because I play 

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:49.160
 it seemed absolutely developed by a 

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:51.170
 internal team of nintendo why le 

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:53.570
 similarities with the historical chapters of the 

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:56.440
 saga and not that this is bad they were 

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:56.440
 remarkable
