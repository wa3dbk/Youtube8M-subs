00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:07.560
 madam sir hello welcome to 

00:00:05.550 --> 00:00:08.850
 your edition of 13 hours we 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:10.260
 will then discover a new 

00:00:08.850 --> 00:00:12.869
 equipment offer to motorists 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:14.280
 a snitch that looks like boxes 

00:00:12.869 --> 00:00:16.139
 blacks installed in planes 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:18.150
 the goal is to collect all the 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:21.810
 indications which will be decisive in 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:23.910
 accident case you already know the 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:25.800
 famous black boxes for airplanes 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:27.689
 or sneaks for heavy trucks 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:28.949
 and this same process is proposed 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:30.660
 now optional for 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:32.430
 lambda drivers like you and me 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:34.020
 equipment that can be very 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:35.370
 valuable in case of accident since 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:37.440
 saves all settings 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:39.600
 attention for now the insurance 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:42.930
 do not recognize it yet luc baziz 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:44.910
 a Jean Francois handle this small box 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:46.980
 video has become for some a 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:49.469
 companion who sees everything and 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:51.239
 records a whole sneak kind of 

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:52.800
 black box with images that settles in 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:54.929
 a few minutes on the windshield 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:57.480
 inside a memory card 

00:00:54.929 --> 00:00:59.190
 digital constantly the video is 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:00.660
 recorded it's a loop system 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:03.120
 so the old way where he got nothing 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:04.620
 past will fade automatically and 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:05.220
 useful paths where there has been a 

00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:07.320
 accident 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:08.580
 the sensor inside will smell it and 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:10.590
 will keep it in a memory that is not 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:12.030
 not erasable and here's what the 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:14.840
 embedded cameras of some 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:17.760
 motorists could see and remember 

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:19.770
 here for example after hitting 

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:21.260
 many two wheels commit an offense 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:23.970
 leak 

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:25.920
 arnaud mauduy bought this system ago 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:28.170
 a few months and finally his camera has 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:31.680
 been helpful to another motorist 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:33.570
 I witnessed a bac loms who had 

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:35.700
 hung a parked vehicle 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:37.909
 regular and which one we did not 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:39.679
 stopped so I 

00:01:37.909 --> 00:01:40.990
 especially want to judge neither a paper by 

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:44.060
 which I had a video layout 

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:46.549
 thanks to that it allows the motorist 

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:48.770
 to make a complaint and to be 

00:01:46.549 --> 00:01:51.140
 repay by his absence but the image 

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:51.679
 is it sufficient proof vis-Ã -vis 

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:53.479
 of the law 

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:55.490
 not yet but she brings an element 

00:01:53.479 --> 00:01:57.020
 additional that the judge can take 

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:58.909
 in account today it's the witness 

00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:01.159
 it is the minutes that have the force of 

00:01:58.909 --> 00:02:02.719
 law but the judge is inclined to make 

00:02:01.159 --> 00:02:04.250
 decisions according to what is him 

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:05.899
 submitted as proof the video mode if that 

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:06.920
 can help you argue a 

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:08.629
 damage damage 

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:10.640
 you use it and you go 

00:02:08.629 --> 00:02:12.620
 to the end with and yet the 

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:14.780
 insurers in France are skeptical 

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:17.030
 according to them the written evidence is sufficient 

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:18.319
 between the amicable findings between the 

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:19.849
 expertise that are made and its 

00:02:18.319 --> 00:02:21.260
 grounds this question is not a 

00:02:19.849 --> 00:02:23.420
 problem for insurance today 

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:26.060
 therefore we consider 

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:27.200
 today this technology does 

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:29.959
 not of major interest for 

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:31.700
 gadgets insurance for some useful 

00:02:29.959 --> 00:02:33.530
 for others the price of the snitch 

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:37.069
 automobiles equipped with one or two 

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:38.840
 cameras range from 129 to 279 euros 

00:02:37.069 --> 00:02:42.700
 an investment that some 

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:42.700
 profitable from their first litigation
