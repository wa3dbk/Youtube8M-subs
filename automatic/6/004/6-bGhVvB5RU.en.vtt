00:00:06.820 --> 00:00:10.390
 with two guys I have a new video 

00:00:09.010 --> 00:00:12.550
 from michael so the guys this 

00:00:10.390 --> 00:00:14.680
 I bring this new called steel in 

00:00:12.550 --> 00:00:15.790
 hansenet or something like that and well he's going to 

00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:19.000
 be a new mineral that we are going to 

00:00:15.790 --> 00:00:20.350
 get from iron as you 

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.060
 Do the first thing we have to do 

00:00:20.350 --> 00:00:24.039
 come being the sound steel that in 

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:26.050
 effect your piece as we do it then 

00:00:24.039 --> 00:00:28.330
 just burning an ingot of 

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:30.640
 iron and so we will get this done 

00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:32.950
 that with the zoom we will be able to do the 

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:35.770
 ingot we simply put 38 of this 

00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:37.210
 way and we will get a single ingot and 

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:39.219
 with the ingot we will be able to do 

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:40.960
 the weapons are typical 

00:00:39.219 --> 00:00:43.059
 it's massive but I'm going to show 

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:45.070
 fast just the funny the typical ones 

00:00:43.059 --> 00:00:47.260
 so I do not see complication too 

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:50.440
 we are going to have a new armor that 

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:53.000
 craft eos are also typical 

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:55.480
 we will also have a block of 

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.480
 decor 

00:00:56.920 --> 00:01:00.649
 a decoration block is fine if 

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:03.310
 we put a block of this in the 

00:01:00.649 --> 00:01:06.610
 inventory will not return the 9 

00:01:03.310 --> 00:01:07.870
 the film obviously and well now 

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:10.120
 let's check the durability that 

00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:10.660
 has the armor and what to do with this 

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:12.100
 here 

00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:13.570
 ok as you can see there in the part 

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:15.970
 lower left our screens 

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:20.740
 You can see the courses as you can see the 

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:25.660
 helmet has 276 on the chest 401 the 

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:27.280
 376 trousers and 326 boots are worth and as 

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:30.910
 by ander fills us almost like a 

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:33.190
 of diamond as you can see there in the in 

00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:34.930
 the protection it gives us no armor 

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:37.270
 they will be able to see and we can not go to 

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:39.400
 see the durability of the weapons all 

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:40.840
 they have 1001 vouchers as they can see all 

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:44.560
 they have 1001 

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:45.789
 and the sword the sword steel is almost 

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:48.759
 just like a diamond like they can 

00:01:45.789 --> 00:01:51.659
 see they are 6.5 and so good if you guys this 

00:01:48.759 --> 00:01:54.250
 the only thing that adds this way the truth 

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:56.409
 has a lot to improve and so on 

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:57.459
 ok but good for now only this 

00:01:56.409 --> 00:01:59.110
 so good guys but that has 

00:01:57.459 --> 00:02:01.319
 liked us well give it like and until the 

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:01.319
 next
