icons and sounds things like that
without<00:01:08.380> using<00:01:08.740> winterboard<00:01:09.210> because<00:01:10.229> it

00:01:11.219 --> 00:01:11.229 
without using winterboard because it

00:01:11.229 --> 00:01:13.429 
without using winterboard because it
definitely<00:01:11.409> helps<00:01:12.070> in<00:01:12.219> overall<00:01:13.060> performance

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:13.439
